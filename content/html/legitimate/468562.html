The County Histories of Scotland 



FIFE AND KINROSS

"All the country between the Forth and the Tay grows narrow 
like a wedge eastward, even to the sea, and it is called Fife, a 
district provided within its own bounds with all things necessary 
for the use of life."— George Buchanan, ' History of Scotland,*

PREFACE. 



The aim of the writer has been to tell in brief compass 
and popular langus^e the history of Scotland so far as 
transacted within the bounds of the old Kingdom, 
which includes the two modern counties of Fife and 
Kinross, or in a few cases by their natives, though 
beyond these bounds. 

It will be readily seen that the book is only a sketch, 
and that there is no intention to compete with the 
learned and exhaustive form of County History which 
gives a complete survey of every part of a county. 
Mr A. H. Millar's comprehensive work of this nature 
on Fife was published after the present volume was in 
type ; but the writer has taken advantage of all other 
sources of information known to him. He is greatly 
indebted to the earlier historians of Fife, and not less to 
many of the natives whose patriotic interest in its past 
as well as its present has led them generously to give

VI PREFACE. 

him the benefit of their valuable local knowledge. The 
attempt has been made, though the phrase is too 
ambitious, to catch the spirit rather than to follow 
the letter of the History of Fife. This will be found 
to include a good deal of the spirit of the history of 
Scotland. Special attention has been given to what- 
ever portrays Character, to Biography when it contains 
illustrations of History, and to Proverbs and Songs, the 
prose and poetry of the life of the people. 

A List of the chief contributions to the History of Fife, 
or of particular places in it, has been printed as an 
Appendix. The List will not satisfy the high require- 
ments of the exact bibliographer, but may perhaps aid 
any reader who desires fuller and more special know- 
ledge. 

The Map by James Gordon, parson of Rothiemay, 
published in the Atlas of the World by John Blaeu of 
Amsterdam, and the modern Map by Mr J. G. Bar- 
tholomew of Edinburgh, may, it is hoped, be found useful 
guides to the geography of the district, which always 
forms, but in this case perhaps more than in some other 
districts, an element of its History. The former repre- 
sents Fife as it was at the close of the first half of the 
seventeenth century, when the modem age had beg^n, 
but the medieval still left its reflex on the map, and 
some shadows of ancient Scotland are still visible. Its 
conception as well as its publication were due to Sir

John Scot of Scotstarvit, a country gentleman of Fife. 
The latter, taken from the Ordnance Survey, presents a

The History of Fife, a district of Scotland which formerly 
included and in this sketch includes Kinross, begins with 
the introduction of Christianity into Scotland as it is told 
in the Legends of the Saints. Prior to Christianity only 
its geography is known. This district embraced all the 
country between the estuaries of the Forth and Tay, and 
is treated as a distinct division in the earliest descriptions 
of Scotland. It formed along with Cowrie the most im- 
portant portion of the kingdom, of which Scone became 
the capital when in the middle of the ninth century Kenneth 
Macalpine subdued the Picts. Its physical geography con-

firms the traditionary history that the wedge-shaped peninsula 
shut off by the sea and the two firths from the rest of Scotland, 
and from modern Perthshire by the Ochils, the highest moun- 
tain-range of southern Scotland, had been one of the many 
separate kingdoms of the Picts, who never formed a united 
monarchy. Several of its place-names still bear witness to the 
existence of an independent, or it may have been a dependent, 
king. Inchrye is the King's Inch, Strathendry the Strath of the 
King, Kilrymont the Church of the King's Mount, and Kings- 
barns is perhaps a translation of an older Celtic name. These 
sites indicate that there were, as was natural, royal forts or 
strongholds both in the west and east of the Pictish kingdom. 
An ancient division of the kingdom of Fife into Fife 
proper and Fothrif, a name whose origin is lost and which 
is now obsolete, dates from Celtic, and it may well be Pagan, 
times, and though originally political, was much longer 
maintained for ecclesiastical purposes in the names of two of 
the deaneries of the diocese of St Andrews. A list of the 
parishes within each, in the thirteenth century, which has been 
preserved, shows that it nearly answered to the eastern and 
western divisions of the county in modern times. The line 
of division was drawn from the mouth of the Leven to the 
east boundary of the parish of Cults, and from Cults by the 
west boundary of Collessie to the east boundary of Auchter- 
muchty. All to the west of this line was Fothrif, and all 
to the east Fife proper. In feudal times another division 
into quarters was introduced. An inquest in 15 17, and the 
Exchequer Rolls of an earlier date, give the names of the 
quarters as Inverkeithing, Dunfermline, Leven, and Eden. 
The number of small shires within the district was remark- 
able, and included Coupre (Cupar), Dunfermline, Forgund 
(Forgan), Fothrif; Gaitmilk and Gelland (Gellat) — places 
now obscure in western Fife — Karel (Crail), Kellin or

MARKINCH OR DALGINCH THE CHIEF PLACE. 3 

Chellin (Kellie), Kennachin (Kennoway?), Kennocher (Kil- 
conquhar), Kercaledinit (Kirkcaldy), Kinglassie, Portmoak 
or the Bishopshire, Lochore, Newbum, Rathully (Rathillet), 
Strathmigloch (Strathmiglo), and Wemyss. Most of these 
shires became parishes, and some of them baronies, and the 
word shire may have been used for any division. Still it is 
singular that the Saxon word was so generally adopted by a 
Celtic race, and it deserves inquiry whether it did not repre- 
sent a partition of the land which descends from Celtic times. 
In several shires we find traces of the Thane or Baron and 
the Serjeant, the feudal equivalents of the Celtic Toshach and 
Mair or Maor. The shire may have been the Celtic " Tuath," 
as Mr Skene conjectures ; but if so, it was the territory of a 
sept rather than a tribe in the ordinary sense of that word. 

Markinch, or its neighbour Dalginch, in the middle of the 
county, was probably the central residence and court of the 
king, where he administered justice. It continued in the time 
of William the Lion to be the place where the warrantors of 
goods challenged as stolen had to appear. A cell of the Cul- 
dees was established there by one of the last Celtic bishops, 
and the ancient cross near Balgonie may mark its site. The 
terraces faintly visible on the north side of the hill may be 
traces, like those on Arthur's Seat, of a primitive form of 
spade husbandry long practised before the plough was known. 
The scoffing proverbs which the rest of the Kingdom still 
cast at Markinch, though their form is modern, may be reflec- 
tions on its former greatness which departed when the old 
Celtic chiefs ceased to be kings, the Culdees were supplanted 
by monks of Roman orders, and the seat of justice was trans- 
ferred to Cupar. To no period after the Celtic can the name 
of The Kingdom, still familiar by tradition to its natives, and 
preserved by Fife alone of the counties of Scotland, be reason- 
ably ascribed.

4 OLD AND NEW SHIRES OF KINROSS. 

The modern shire of Kinross was formed in 1685 by 
the addition to the older shire of the parishes of Portmoak, 
Cleish, and Tullibole, in a charter confirmed by Parliament 
in favour of Sir William Bruce of Kinross, its heritable sheriff. 
The older shire, which seems to have been limited to the 
parishes of Kinross and Orwell, existed at least as early as the 
middle of the thirteenth century, and had become a heredi- 
tary sheriffdom at the date of Edward I.*s ordinance in 1305 
for the government of Scotland, in which John of Kinross is 
named as sheriff of fee or hereditary sheriff. Like Clack- 
mannan, it returned a member to the Scottish Parliament 
after James I. introduced representation and dispensed with 
the attendance of the small barons in 1427. But it con- 
tinued to muster, as of old, with the men of Fife at wapin- 
schaws and royal levies. The parish of Portmoak, or at all 
events those lands in it which had belonged to the Church 
and of which the Bishop of St Andrews was superior, were 
identical with the Bishopshire, a name still in popular use 
and preserved in the Bishop's Hill and Bishop's Muir, which 
formed a lordship or regality under the bishop, and his own 
officers. But one of the later bishops, George Martin con- 
jectures Bishop Schevez, ceded the rights of the see in the 
Bishopshire to Douglas of Lochleven, as he did those in 
Muckartshire to Campbell of Argyle. 

The union of Portmoak, Cleish, and Tullibole with Kinross, 
and the formation of Kinross into a modern county, was due 
to the favour and influence of Sir William Bruce, the royal 
architect of Charles II. He is said to have built the House 
of Kinross as a residence for the Duke of York in case the 
Exclusion Bill had debarred him from the English throne.

When George Buchanan declares that Kinross and other

MODERN CHANGES IN KINROSS. S 

small shires owed their origin to ambition, he must of course 
refer to the older shire. But it is not improbable that this 
was one of the cases in which an old shire represented an 
ancient Celtic division. In 1323 an inquest held at Kinross 
separated the lands of the Forest from the lands of the 
Thanage of that name. So the shire of Kelly (Chellin) ap- 
pears from a charter of David I. to have been the district 
of a thane, and Mr Skene's research has detected traces of 
thanages of Kinneir, Dairsie, Falkland, and perhaps Fordell. 

Robert the Bruce granted the church of Kinross and the 
chapel of Orwell to the monks of Dunfermline, in honour of 
his royal predecessors buried at Dunfermline Abbey, which 
he had specially chosen for his own sepulture ; and this grant 
was confirmed by Bishop Lamberton. The separation of the 
ecclesiastical patronage from St Andrews may have been 
caused by, and would certainly confirm, the separation of 
the civil jurisdiction. 

In the present century Kinross has been the subject 
of more than one change of jurisdiction by a vacillating 
Legislature, although its boundaries, subject to slight alter- 
ations by the Boundary Commission, have remained the 
same. In 1807 the shire of Kinross was disjoined from 
Fife and united to Clackmannan under one sheriff. By an 
Act passed in 1853 Clackmannan and Kinross were united 
with Linlithgow, but another in 1870 reunited it with Fife 
as regards the jurisdiction of the sheriff. The British Par- 
liament had slowly learned the natural connection of the 
two counties which formed the ancient kingdom. In parlia- 
mentary representation Kinross is united not with Fife but 
Clackmannan. 

The area of Fife is nearly 315,000 imperial acres. Its 
population in 1891 was 190,365, and the valuation of its 
lands and heritages in 1894 was ^1,148,147. The area of

6 AREA — POPULATION — VALUATIONS. 

Kinross is 46,487 acres. Its population in 1891 was 6373, 
and its valuation in 1894 was ;£62,o65, or, if effect is given 
to the alterations of the last Boundary Commission, ;£6 7,343. 
The total population of the two counties is now probably about 
200,000, and the total valuation, which has fallen somewhat 
in consequence of agricultural depression, about ^1,215,490. 
In spite of this depression Fife may still be deemed a pros- 
perous and populous district, and the description of Pennant, 
the English traveller, in 1770, though exaggerated, is in the 
main true : " The peninsula of Fife is a county so populous 
that except the environs of London [and we must now add 
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and a few other towns], 
scarce one in South Britain can vie with it, fertile in soil, 
abundant in cattle, happy in collieries, in ironstone, lime, and 
freestone, rich in manufactures ; the property remarkably well 
divided, none insultingly powerful to distress and often de- 
populate a county, the most of the fortunes of a useful 
mediocrity." 

It is the aim of the following pages to trace the origin and 
causes of this prosperity, to give an outline of the vicissitudes 
of the history of Fife, as well as of the part it has taken in 
the history of Scotland, and to discover the character of its 
natives. "Fife," remarks a recent writer, Mr Geddie, who 
has graphically illustrated the fringes or coast of the county, 
"contains the concentrated essence of Scottish history and 
character." Probably other parts of Scotland might dispute 
the claim. But I shall be well pleased if this sketch of the 
little ancient Kingdom from the dawn of history to the pres- 
ent time should be found to explain some points in the history 
of Scotland and some traits in the character of the Scottish 
people. 

If we wish to know anything of Fife before the seventh 
century, we must have recourse to archaeology, which pursues

different methods and arrives at a different kind of result 
from history. The Roman historians, and their inferior suc- 
cessors, the Byzantine and Latin writers of the early middle 
ages, enable us to catch glimpses of other parts of Scotland. 
Fife is a dark and unknown land. 

The fleet of Agricola must have sailed round its coast on the 
way to Orkney, the Ultima Thule or North Pole of the Roman 
world. The Roman legions probably more than once crossed the 
Forth and passed the Ochils. But there is no record that they 
conquered the district between Kinross and Muckross, as its 
Celtic natives called, in their apt way of naming places, the head 
and snout of the well-defined promontory of Scotland which lies 
south of the Caledonian Forest, between the Tay and the 
Forth. Supposed remains of Roman roads and camps in the 
neighbourhood of Dunfermline and at Loch Or are doubtful, 
and similar discoveries farther east are imaginary antiquities. 
The zeal of a local minister, the Rev. Andrew Small, and a 
military antiquary. Colonel Millar, found one of the many sites 
of the battle of the Grampians in the parish of Strathmiglo, at 
a ford of the Eden called Merlsford, near Wellfield House. 
No one now defends this position. The very few Roman 
coins which have been found in Fife prove there can have 
been no permanent occupation of any part of the county. 
They may well have been collections made after the Romans 
left, or, like similar finds in Ireland, are independent of any 
conquest. The halting lines of the old Fife poet are nearer 
true though somewhat boastful history than the guesses of the 
old antiquaries : — 

** But thou didst scorn Rome's captive for to be, 
And kept thyself from Roman legions free.'' 

Sir Robert Sibbald's conjecture, that "after-times may dis- 
cover in this shire many Roman antiquities when curious 
persons shall search for them," has not been confirmed.

8 LEGENDS OF SAINTS EARLIEST HISTORY. 

Before the Romans came in the first, and after they left in 
the fifth, century, this district was a part of the country then 
perhaps called Alban, and now Scotland. Its first known 
inhabitants belonged to the branch of Celts named Picts, 
perhaps the painted race, though some think it a tribal name. 
They were called in their own tongue Cruithne. Fibh (pro- 
nounced Fife) was, according to an early mythical genealogy, 
one of the seven sons of Cruithne, the father of the race from 
whom it took its name. No satisfactory etymology has been 
found either for Cruithne or Fibh. Neither name represented 
real persons. They are only the figures in a myth which con- 
tains some crushed and buried fragments of history. 

It was after the earliest Celtic annals had faded into poetic 
myths, and the Roman historians had passed away with the 
Roman Empire, that the narratives of the lives of the first 
Christian missionaries shed a dim historic light on the shores 
and a few places in the interior of Fife. 

The Legends of the Saints tell the stories of those who 
converted pagan races to Christianity, or who reformed the 
corruptions of the Christianity of their age. Written in general 
long after the events, the legends were read in the churches, 
especially in those dedicated to the saint where his relics 
rested, or were supposed to rest. They contain fictitious as 
well as historical matter. Miracles and prophecies, sometimes 
childish in naivetd, sometimes childlike in simplicity, mingle 
with the natural acts of the guides who led barbarians along 
the first steps of civilisation, and taught heathens the elements 
of Christian doctrine and morals. The earlier Saints are 
bom, and live, and die, contrary to the ordinary course of 
nature. They subsist without food, walk the waves, lay the 
storms, kill the living, and cure the dying, by a sign or a word. 
They have not so much visions of, as actual conflicts with, Satan 
and his devils, and actual converse with good angels, with

INTERPRETATION OF LEGENDS. 9 

Christ and God. But they also kill wild beasts, reclaim waste 
lands, plant fruit-trees, find and hallow wells, erect crosses, 
enclose cemeteries, and found churches. Whatever may be 
real and whatever invented, they were the preachers of the 
virtue of purity, the gospel of peace, the hope of eternal 
life. 

Our ancestors in the middle ages believed the whole 
Legend. They testified to their belief by dedicating churches 
and putting up crosses and images in honour of the Saints. 
They venerated and enshrined what had been blessed by holy 
hands, the bells and books, the banners and crosiers. They 
celebrated the Saints' days by festivals, fairs, and pilgrimages. 
They called their children and their homes after the names of 
the Saints. 

Our nearer kin of the Reformation denounced almost 
the whole Legend as superstitious. They demolished the 
churches, broke the images, destroyed the books which re- 
corded the lives of the Saints, cast their relics to the winds, 
altered or forgot their days, and corrupted the names their 
forefathers deemed the holiest of the holy. It is the hard but 
needful task of history to sift the true from the false, and to 
try so far as possible to realise by what men, and by what 
means, the country we live in became Christian. As an artist 
would lovingly preserve the half-faded, half-repainted canvas of 
an old master, or a reverent architect the ruins of an abbey 
or cathedral, so should the historian interpret the Legends. 
They contain, mingled with the dust of antiquity and the 
incense of superstition, the true relics of noble lives. 

Piecing together what we find in the lives of the Saints, 
and rejecting what is incredible, the probable story of the 
conversion of Fife may be briefly told. 

The absence, with three exceptions, probably of a later 
date, of any dedication to St Ninian in Fife, is strong evi-

lO LEGEND OF ST SERF. 

dence that its natives did not belong to the southern Picts, 
whom the British apostle of Galloway converted in the be- 
ginning of the fifth century. The isolated dedication to St 
Columba at Inchcolm, where a solitary hermit monk may 
have come from lona at an earlier period, but whose monastery 
dates from Alexander I., is a similar proof that neither that 
saint, nor his immediate successors as Abbots of lona, 
planted churches on the shores or islands of the Forth. But 
Adamnan, his biographer, the ninth Abbot of lona, who lived 
in the end of the seventh century, and died in 704, may, as 
he certainly visited Northumbria, have landed at Inchkeith, 
where there was once a church or a cell dedicated to him. 

It was to another saint of the early Celtic Church, St Serf, 
that the conversion of Fife was due. There is difficulty in 
fixing his exact date, but no reasonable doubt as to his exist- 
ence. The Legends vary by several centuries. According 
to one. Serf was the companion and suffragan of Palladius, 
long believed to have been sent on a mission to the Scots by 
Pope Celestine early in the fifth century. But there were 
few, if any, Scots in Scotland at this date, and none in Fife, 
which was still peopled by Picts, and ruled by Pictish kings 
for three centuries later. So this legend, in which Palladius 
is perhaps confused with St Patrick, who converted the Scots 
of Ireland, must be dismissed. In another story. Serf was 
the adoptive father of Kentigern, the contemporary of Col- 
umba, the apostle of Cumbria and first Bishop of Glasgow, 
who, according to this legend, was born at Culross, where 
Serf then lived, and where Kentigern's mother, Thenew, had 
been driven by a storm. 

Yet a third, and it is probably the truest, form of the 
legend makes Serf contemporary with Adamnan, by whose 
advice he undertook the conversion of Fife. This would 
correspond with the date of Brude, the son of Derili, one of 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



ST SERF CONVERTS PICTS OF FIFE. II 

many Pictish kings of that name ; and a Brude, the son of 
Dergart, is said to have given the isle of Lochleven to St Serf 
and the Culdees, as an earlier Brude had given lona to St 
Columba. It was the tendency of medieval legend to ante- 
date itself, through the natural fondness most men have for 
antiquity, and the desire to prove that the country to which 
the legend relates had a more ancient Christianity than other 
districts. 

The parentage of Serf is not known. One legend makes 
him son of a Canaan ite king and Arab princess, and relates 
that before he came to Scotland he was Pope for seven years, 
at a date in the sixth century when we know there was no 
such Pope. Another legend calls him an Israelite ; and a 
third, in a tract on " The Mothers of the Saints," gives him 
an Irish mother, which is probably due to its author having 
been himself an Irish Celt. His name of Serf, in Latin 
ServanuSf may indicate no more than that he was a servant of 
God like the Culdees, whose name has a similar meaning. 

But while there is so much doubtful and uncertain about 
Serf, the places to which he brought the Gospel do not mate- 
rially vary, and are confirmed by subsequent history. Most 
of them are connected with Fife, which was the centre of his 
ministry. He meets Adamnan at Inchkeith, and having asked 
Adamnan " How he should dispose of his followers," is told, 
" Let them inhabit the land of Fife from the hill of the Bri- 
tons [Largo Law?] to the hill called Okhel [the Ochils]." 
The cave at Dysart still bears his name, and marks probably 
his first landing-place and home in Fife. Thence he pro- 
ceeded north and west. He founds a church and cemetery at 
Culross, where for many centuries his day was kept on ist July 
by a procession of the inhabitants carrying green boughs, — 
an example of the wise policy by which Pope Gregory, as Bede 
relates, directed that on the day of the dedication " the people

might be allowed to build themselves huts of the boughs of 
trees where heathen temples had been turned into churches, 
and no longer offer beasts to the devil, but to the praise of 
God, in their eating returning thanks to the giver of all things 
for their food." He visits Portmoak, on the banks of Loch- 
leven, where an early church bore his name. The erection 
of the small monastery on the island called his Inch, in the 
same loch, may have been during his own life, or a later 
foundation in his honour. He preaches at Tillibothy, now 
Tullibody, at Tillicoultry, at Alva where a well still bears his 
name, and at Airthrie. He cannot have built the present 
narrow bridge over the Devon which leads to the old road 
through the Ochils to Strathearn ; but its name of St Serfs 
bridge is probably a reminiscence that he passed that way in 
one of his missions. He died and was buried at Culross. 
The Gille-Serfs of Clackmannan mentioned in a charter of 
David I., who may be compared with the Brandanes or men 
of St Brendan, in Bute, show that grants had been made from 
the royal domain, which afterwards became the shire of that 
name, to St Serf himself, or more probably to his successors 
in the monastery of Lochleven. The island called St Serf's 
Inch was the gift of Brude, the last Pictish king. Macbeth 
and his queen added the lands of Kirkness, Portmoak, and 
Bolgyn (Bogie, near Kirkcaldy); Malcolm Canmore and 
Margaret added Balchristie in the parish of Newburn, and 
their son Ethelred, Auchmore ; and Malduin, Tuathal, and 
Fothad II., the last Celtic Bishops of St Andrews, the 
patronage and lands of the churches of Markinch, Scoonie, 
and Auchterderran. 

The parochial system had already to some extent begun 
in the time of the Celtic Church. When Bishop De Bernham 
made the visitations of his diocese between 1239 and 1249, 
and dedicated or rededicated about 140 parish churches, the

DEDICATIONS TO CELTIC SAINTS. 1 3 

names of the Celtic saints, their original founders, were still 
preserved, — as St Adrian at Flisk and Lindores, St Serf at 
Parva Kingorn, afterwards Burntisland, Kinross and Clack- 
mannan, St Memma at Scoonie, St Maelrubha at Crail, St 
Ethernan at Kilrenny and Lathrisk, St Monan at St Monans 
and Kilconquhar, St Cainnech at Kennoway; but in some 
cases, perhaps in all, for the record is imperfect, a Roman 
saint was conjoined with the Celtic, as St John with St 
Modrust at Markinch, St Stephen with St Moak or Mollock 
at Portmoak, St Andrew with St Fillan at Forgan. 

The most northern point St Serf reached was Dunning, in 
Strathearn, where tradition said he slew a dragon in the den 
still called the " Dragon's Den." The mention of his name 
in other places in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire seems due 
to foundations after his death, but he is personally connected 
with several places in Fife, especially with Dysart and with 
Creich. At Dysart he had his famous argument with the 
"Devil," so quaintly told by Wyntoun, in which the Saint 
always has the better — 

*• TTien saw the Dewyl that he cowthc noucht 
With all the wylis that he sowcht 
Ourecum Saynct Serf; he said than 
He kend hym for a wys man, 
For he wan at hym na profyte. 
Saynct Serf sayd, ** Thou wrech, ga 
Fra this stede, and noy na ma 
In -to this stede, I byd the. 
Suddanly theyne passyd he : 
Fra that stede he held hym away, 
And never was sene thare till this day. " 

The Church during the time of St Serf was monastic. He 
was a monk, not a bishop. The rule he followed was framed 
chiefly for hermits who passed their days in solitary cells, not 
in communities like the monks of St Augustine's or St Bene- 
dict's rule. Whether it was identical with the earliest form

14 CULDEE MONASTERIES. 

of the Culdee rule or not, the Culdees of Lochleven accepted 
St Serf as their patron. 

It was a Pictish race that St Serf converted, and it was a 
Pictish king who gave the island to the Culdees. Nothing 
is more certain than the fact that the Picts in Fife, as else- 
where, became Christian. Nothing is more singular than the 
fact that, having become Christian, they have left so little 
record of their history, and such meagre vestiges even of 
their language. 

There were at least two other foundations of Culdees in 
Fife which became more famous than Lochleven. These 
were Abernethy and St Andrews. Their origin is very 
obscure. If we could accept tradition they belonged even 
to an earlier date, but it is probable that in their case also 
true history has been perverted by the attempt to claim a 
greater antiquity than the facts warrant. Abernethy is said 
to have been founded by a Pictish King Nectan in honour 
of St Bridget, Abbess of Kildare in Ireland, at the request 
of the next abbess of the same convent, Darlugdach, who 
was present and chanted the Halleluia Hymn when the 
king's offering was made. St Bridget was a contemporary 
of St Patrick and died early in the sixth century, and Dar- 
lugdach was her immediate successor. But Nectan Morbet, 
called the son of Erip, is a very shadowy Pictish king. The 
Nectan best known to history did not reign till the seventh 
century ; so here again we are perplexed by dates. Fortun- 
ately, chronology, though often the best, is only one, of the 
guides of history. It is probable that Abernethy was founded 
by a mission from the Irish Church, and dedicated to Bridget, 
the saint who has been called the Mary of Ireland. The 
Culdees must have been a later foundation if Abernethy was 
originally intended for religious women under the rule of St 
Bridget, for the introduction of women into the Culdees'

LEGEND OF ST ANDREW. 1 5 

monasteries was a corruption of their primitive Rule. They 
did not belong to the first age of the saints, which, accord- 
ing to Irish hagiology, included women as well as men, and 
allowed the services of women even in monasteries. Accord- 
ing to Fordoun, Abernethy became the see of the Bishop 
of the Celtic Church of Scotland after Dunkeld, and in its 
church three elections of bishops were made, while as yet 
there was only one bishop in Scotland. 

The other Culdee monastery was at Kilrigmonaigh or Kil- 
rymont, near St Andrews. The first preaching of Christianity 
in East Fife was attributed to Cainnech (Kenneth), patron saint 
of Kennoway, in the end of the sixth century ; but his fame 
was eclipsed by that of St Regulus or St Rule, who is credited 
by the legend with having brought the relics of St Andrew 
from Patras in Achaia to St Andrews, where he received a gift 
of a district called the Boar's Chase from Hungus or Angus, 
a Pictish king. This name is still preserved in Boar's Hill, 
though some think the original name was Byre's Hill, which 
suggests a different derivation. A confusion not yet dispelled 
is found in the body of this legend, which makes Constantius, 
an emperor of the fourth century, in whose reign the relics are 
said to have been removed from Patras in Achaia, the con- 
temporary of Angus, a Pictish king of the eighth century, who 
is said to have defeated Athelstan, the Saxon king of the end 
of the ninth century, through the aid of St Andrew. It is 
impossible not to suspect the hand of a patriotic but ignorant 
Scottish monk of the later time, when Scotland was fighting 
for its existence against the monarchs of England, in this 
manipulation of the legend. Yet there was a legend to 
manipulate, and a legend is not an invention, but a distor- 
tion of facts. That Scotland at a very early date accepted 
St Andrew as its patron is beyond doubt. He is the only 
Scottish Saint whose day has survived all ecclesiastical change

l6 LEGENDS OF ST ADRIAN AND ST MONAN. 

and is observed by Protestants as well as Romanists. There 
were twelve Celtic bishops, probably Culdees of St Andrews, 
from Cellach in the reign of Constantine, son of Aedh, down 
to the election of the Anglian Turgot in the reign of Malcolm 
Canmore. 

Of the other saints connected with Fife, the most memor- 
able was Adrian, called in his legend, perhaps by a later 
addition to flatter or honour the country from which Queen 
Margaret came, a Hungarian, who settled in the Isle of May, 
where he was martyred by the Danes about the middle of the 
ninth century, at a time when Hungary was not yet Christian. 
The ruins of a little church called after him, which was a 
favourite place of pilgrimage, may still be seen. The haven 
where the pilgrims, one of the most constant of whom was 
James IV., landed, is still called Pilgrim's Haven, and the 
Lady's, the Pilgrim's, St John's, and St Andrew's wells are 
still pointed out, though their brackish waters have lost the 
magic virtue they were credited with in early Christian, pos- 
sibly in pagan times. To Adrian the churches of Lindores 
and Flisk were dedicated under the name of St Magridin, 
which perhaps appeared on the inscription of MacdufTs 
Cross. In the caves of Caiplie, in the East Neuk of Fife, 
may still be seen rude crosses which may have been cut on 

the rock — 

'* When Adrian with his company 
Together came to Caplauchy." 

St Monan, in whose honour the church of Abercromby was 
named St Monans, was one of the companions of Adrian, and 
his relics were supposed to rest at In very, until transferred by 
David II. to the church which afterwards bore his name; 
though Mr Skene prefers to identify him with Moinen, an 
Irish bishop of Clonfert, whose relics may have been brought 
over from the great monastery founded by St Brendan, the

navigator, on the banks of the Shannon, to save them from the 
Danish raidera St Fillan, an Irish saint of the eighth cen- 
tury, whose name is chiefly associated with the parish on Loch- 
earnside, where he left his crosier enclosed in the quigrach 
now in the Antiquarian Museum, and his bell, also left traces 
of his footsteps in the cave at Pittenweem called after him ; 
and the parish of Forgan was originally dedicated to St 
Fillan. 

Such figures flit past us like shades in the dark background 
of history. But some of the buildings associated with their 
names, though not founded in their time, keep alive their 
memory and attest the belief in their existence. We still 
gaze with wonder and admiration on the round tower of Aber- 
nethy, whose form demonstrates its Irish origin ; the square 
tower of St Regulus, which recalls the Byzantine architecture 
of Ravenna ; and the pointed spire of St Monans of compara- 
tively recent date, replacing the earlier edifice which contained 
his shrine. 

Impossible as it is to fix dates with any approach to preci- 
sion, it may be safely concluded that these saints flourished 
while most of the population of Fife was still Pictish. A 
common Christianity facilitated the union of the two branches 
of the Celtic race in the north and east of Scotland. Had 
the one been heathen and the other Christian, there would 
have been records of a much longer and more desperate con- 
flict. It is not improbable that the ecclesiastics may have 
been the main agents in effecting the union, although the 
Churches of the Picts and Scots for a time stood out for 
their peculiar privileges and special customs. Throughout 
the legends, which in this point at least reflect the true 
history, it was the heathen Danes, not the pagan Celts, who 
made martyrs of the Scottish saints. 

In the middle of the ninth century, the Scots of the West

l8 FIFE BECOMES PART OF KINGDOM OF SCONE. 

Highlands and Isles, and the Picts of the north and centre of 
Scotland, were united in one monarchy by Kenneth Macal- 
pine. His chief seat was Scone. All traces of the early fort 
and abbey, and even of the Moot hill, are obliterated by Lord 
Mansfield's modem palace and policies. It requires a strong 
effort of imagination to recall the fact that this low-lying 
ground, guarded only by the swift-flowing Tay, was the central 
seat of the Scottish monarchy for many centuries. But a ford 
in the days before bridges was often one of the best natural 
defences. The site of Dublin was also due to a ford, from 
which it took its older name of Athcliath, the ford of the 
hurdles. A town often outlives the cause which determined 
its site. 

Scone is not a far cry from Abemethy, nor even from 
Dunfermline or St Andrews. There seems no doubt that 
Fife was included at an early date in this kingdom, though on 
what terms its Pictish kings, of whom Brude, son of Dergard, 
is said to have been the last, submitted to the. growing Scottish 
monarchy, we do not know. 

The submission of the Picts was probably connected with 
the new organisation of the Celtic Church in the plan of 
Diocesan Episcopacy which took the place of the purely 
monastic system. In the reign of Kenneth Macalpine, some 
relics of Columba were transferred from lona to Dunkeld; 
and Tuathal, son of Artgusa, Abbot of Dunkeld, is called 
in the middle of the ninth century chief Bishop of Fortren, 
a district whose bounds included the Picts of Forfar and 
Perth. After TuathaFs death in the reign of Constantine 
MacKenneth, there were three bishops who belonged, not to 
Dunkeld, but to Abernethy. Abemethy was then the eccle- 
siastical seat of the whole realm of the Picts. The names 
of the bishops of Abernethy are lost; their successor was 
Cellach, who lived half a century later in the reign of

BISHOPS OF THE SCOTS AT ABERNETHY. I9 

Constantine MacAedh. This king, along with his bishop, 
swore at a conference on the little hill at Scone to preserve 
the laws and discipline of the faith, and the rights of the 
churches and the gospels, on an equality with the Scots. 
Such is the brief fragment of the Pictish chronicle which 
excites and baffles our curiosity. The Celtic bishop, who is 
called Bishop of the Scots, was the overseer or ecclesiastical 
superintendent of a district, and his district or diocese was 
the whole Scottish Pictish monarchy. 

The earlier Celtic Church, both in Ireland and Scotland, 
had also bishops. The theory that there was a primitive 
Church with only presbyters has no place in history. But 
these early bishops differed greatly from the lordly prelates 
of the medieval Church. In Ireland, if we could accept 
implicitly the annalists' numbers, bishops were so numerous, 
sometimes hundreds connected with a single monastery, that 
they could not have held distinct territorial offices. In Scot- 
land there is no trace of such a multiplicity of bishops, 
and there is reason to suppose that its earliest Church 
was neither Episcopal nor Presbyterian, but Monastic. The 
exact position of the earliest Scottish bishops is obscure, 
but they seem to have exercised the power of ordination, 
and to have been held in special honour, although not in 
such high honour as the abbots of the monasteries, the suc- 
cessors of St Columba or St Serf. The creation of a chief 
bishop for the whole kingdom was a step from the Monastic 
to the Episcopal Diocesan Church. Scotland was no longer 
pagan, with merely points of Gospel light shining from mon- 
astic cloisters, chiefly in islands, and hermit cells chiefly in 
unfrequented places called deserts, of which Dysart may have 
been one (though some prefer the Gaelic etymology of the 
Point of God, in remembrance of St Serfs landing), or in 
caves. All round the coast from Dysart to St Andrews,

20 CHURCH OF THE SCOTS BECOMES DIOCESAN, 

wherever the sea has hollowed the sandstone strata, there 
may still be seen the chambers or cells in which the earliest 
missionaries lived and worshipped. In some the crosses by 
which they were hallowed may be dimly traced, as in the 
caves of Wemyss, though they have disappeared from the 
caves which bear the names of St Serf at Dysart and of St 
Rule at St Andrews. Such places retained long their old 
sanctity, but the Church had now gone out to leaven the 
heathen world. The diocese of the bishop with the chapter 
of his cathedral, originally taken from the Culdee monks, was 
divided into parishes with separate churches and priests, who 
permeated the whole country, and educated the whole people 
in a way the solitary hermit or the cloistered monk could not 
have done. The ministers of religion were no longer saints 
or hermits, virgins or martyrs ; they became mitred bishops, 
abbots, and priors, the councillors, sometimes the rulers, of 
the king and of the nation. 

Why was it that the chief pastor of this reorganised Church 
migrated from lona to Dunkeld, from Dunkeld to Abernethy, 
from Abernethy to St Andrews ? It was probably due to the 
political causes which directed the course of Scottish history 
from the close of the ninth to the middle of the eleventh 
century. The Celtic monarchy, after its union, pressed for- 
ward from the west and north to the east and south. The 
dreaded attacks of Danish and Norse Vikings, whose long 
dragon boats preyed on the coasts and sailed up the firths or 
fiords, forced the consolidation of the kingdom. Scone, an 
inland place, was now a safer political, and Dunkeld or Aber- 
nethy a safer ecclesiastical centre. The Danes' Dyke, between 
Balcomie and Fife Ness, in the East Neuk, was probably 
built to defend the coast of Fife from their depredations. 
Near it, in the black cave, or at Inverdovat in the parish of 
Forgan, Constantine I., the son of Kenneth Macalpine, was

slain in 88 1 by the Dubhgall, or Black Strangers, as the Irish 
called the Danes. 

It is not so clear why St Andrews obtained and retained 
the primacy of the Church in preference to Dunkeld. It 
never was the royal seat of the united monarchy, though the 
names of Kilrymont (the Church of the King's Mount) and 
Kingsbarns confirm the tradition which made it one of the 
residences of the district Pictish king. It was situated at the 
comer of the Kingdom ; it had no rich lands such as those 
which attracted later monks to Cupar, Pittenweem, Balmerino, 
Lindores, and Culross. Its rocky headland, where we still 
trace the outline of the little Culdee church on the Kirk- 
heugh, is washed by the sea on which the northern pirates 
had their home, and from which they ravaged the coasts. 
Along the whole coast of Fife the spade or the plough now 
and again reveals the skeletons of those merciless invaders, 
and of those who died to defend their homes. Why should a 
spot so barren and exposed have been selected for the Scottish 
Canterbury ? Probably it was because it alone claimed, of all 
the churches of Scotland, the possession of the relics of an 
apostle, the brother of St Peter, and because, like Kent, it 
w^as the first landing-place and settlement of Roman mis- 
sionaries. The name of St Andrew, as the Church multi- 
plied and became more closely connected &gt;vith Rome, was 
deemed more venerable than that of St Columba or St 
Serf, or any local Celtic saint. 

The decline and fall of the Celtic Church and the Culdee 
monasteries began when Malcolm and Margaret introduced 
the Roman ritual, and brought English canons from Durham / 
to instruct the Scottish Church. It was concluded when 
David I. transferred their possessions to the Canons Regular, 
who elected English bishops to the See of St Andrews. Some 
traces, however, lingered till the end of the thirteenth century.

22 MARGARET THE ATHELING COMES TO FIFE. 

when the Culdees were finally excluded from voting in the 
election of the bishops. An outward sign of their extinction 
was lately brought to light, when it was found that the Celtic 
crosses on their tombs had been used for the foundations of 
the east wall and window of the Cathedral. 

The subjection of the Irish and Scottish Churches was one of 
the first triumphs of Ultramontane Romanism, which, after so 
many centuries of conquest, interrupted by the Reformation, 
were followed by its victory over the Gallican and other 
national Churches, and were consummated by the decrees of 
the Vatican Council in spite of the protests of some of the 
most learned Catholics. 

The first period of the history of Fife, the age of the Saints, 
closes with St Margaret, the wife of Malcolm Canmore. Her 
life is indissolubly linked with another locality of Fife, Dun- 
fermline. The Scottish monarchy had gone on increasing 
under a series of vigorous kings, who moved its boundaries 
farther and farther south during the decline of the Anglian 
monarchy of Northumbria. Lothian had been conquered. 
The Rock of Dunedin, originally perhaps a Pictish Dun, 
afterwards a Northumbrian Burgh of Edwin the Fair, was 
now one of the strongholds of the Scottish monarchs. Their 
raids had extended far beyond the present limits of the Tweed 
and Solway, and were the terror of Northern England, which 
they called Saxony, the land of the Sassenach. In the middle 
of the eleventh century Malcolm Canmore, the son of Duncan, 
a Celt by speech and paternity, but whose mother was an 
Anglo-Dane, daughter of Earl Siward of Northumbria, re- 
covered his father's throne, which Macbeth, perhaps the repre- 
sentative of the Northern Celtic Kings, or Maormor, had 
usurped. Though educated at the Court of Edward the Con- 
fessor, and aided by Tostig, the Saxon Earl of Northumbria, 
Malcolm, true to his father's blood, was the enemy of the

Norman kings of England. A few years later the Norman 
Conquest brought as exiles to his Court three members of 
the dethroned Saxon royal house. Edgar the Atheling, and 
his sisters Margaret and Christina, were children of Edward, 
the son of Edmund Ironside, who had been driven from 
England by Canute, and had taken refuge in Hungary, where 
Edward married Agatha, a kinswoman of Gisela, wife of St 
Stephen, King of Hungary, and sister of the Emperor Henry 
II. Margaret had been educated in the school of adversity 
as well as in the school of Christianity. Her rare beauty and 
bright intelligence won and held the heart of the fierce king. 
Marriage and its duties did not make him cease fighting. 
His life was still spent in almost constant war with England, 
now ruled by its Norman conquerors. But his domestic, and 
especially his ecclesiastical policy, was directed by his wife. 
Her character more than his has left its mark on the civilisa- 
tion of Scotland. They were married in 1070 at Dunferm- 
line, where Malcolm had a tower on an isolated mound, 
surrounded on every side but one by the deep dell cut by 
the Linn burn from which Dunfermline takes its name. Its 
foundation may still be seen in the grounds of Pitten- 
crieff, a little west of the later palace. At Dunfermline 
their children were born ; and there, a few years later, in 
honour of the marriage, were laid the foundations of the 
Abbey Church, the little Scottish Durham. Its nave and 
west door are amongst the best specimens of Early Norman 
architecture in Scotland. With Durham Malcolm and his 
house were closely connected. He was present at the 
foundation of its new cathedral in 1093, and his son Alex- 
ander witnessed the translation of the relics of St Cuthbert 
from Lindisfarne in 1104. Beneath its altar lay the relics 
of the Celtic saint, Aidan, and the Lothian saint, Cuthbert. 
Its archives contain the earliest Scottish charters. It was

natural that the model of Durham should be followed in 
the choice of the site and in the architecture of Dunferm- 
line, which may have been the work of the same masons. 
Only the commencement of the building was made during 
Margaret's life, but it was completed by her son, David I. 
It was enriched by gifts of lands from her husband. She 
herself gave it gold and silver ornaments for the sacred 
offices, and the crucifix or reliquary studded with gems which 
held the precious rood of black wood, carved out of a frag- 
ment, she believed, of the cross of Christ, with the figure of 
our Saviour sculptured in solid ivory. There, too, was held 
the memorable Council, when, at her instance, the Celtic 
Church was reformed. It was instructed by her, assisted by 
the monks of Durham, in the observance of the Lord's Day, 
the Roman ritual for the Mass, and the prohibition of incest- 
uous marriage. Her Court was a model of purity. In it no 
wicked or scandalous word was spoken. More civilised cus- 
toms were introduced in dress and for the table, and the use 
of linen more probably than tartan, though both have claimed 
her as their earliest patron. The Grace Cup became known 
in Scotland as Queen Margaret's Blessing. Charity was taught 
by example. The Queen fed the poor with food she herself 
prepared ; at her cost were erected the first Scottish inns, rest- 
ing-places on the roads and guest-houses on either side of the 
Forth for the pilgrims who came to Dunfermline by the ferry, 
called after her the Queensferry, as that near Elie was called 
the Earlsferry, after the Earl of Fife. The stone where she 
rested is still pointed out on the highroad from North Queens- 
ferry to Dunfermline. 

Her prayers were constant ; and the little cave on the Linn, 
just below the present Drill Hall of the Volunteers, enabled 
her to practise them in secret. Such are some of the traits in 
the life by her confessor Turgot. It is the portrait of a friendly

and courtly hand, but bears marks of truth. Only one miracle 
is recorded. Margaret's Book of the Gospels read during 
Mass, illuminated with miniatures of the Evangelists, having 
been allowed by a careless bearer to fall into the water, 
was recovered without stain save a mark of damp. Her 
biographer, declaring his own belief in this simplest of all 
miracles, which occurs in the life of more than one Celtic 
saint, expresses doubt whether others will credit it. How 
different from the spirit in which Adamnan describes the 
miracles that crowd his life of Columba, or Bede those he 
relates in the life of St Cuthbert I The tide of belief in 
present miracle had begun to ebb, and has never since 
flowed. Margaret died in 1093 in the Castle of Edin- 
burgh, shortly after her son Edgar brought the news of her 
husband's death. Her last breath was spent in the prayer 
that this trial might purge her from sin. Under cover of 
a fog her body was taken out of the castle by the door in 
the western bastion recently restored, carried across the firth, 
and buried at Dunfermline. The limestone slabs which 
covered her tomb still stand a few feet beyond the east window 
of the modern church ; but her relics were dispersed by an 
untoward fate. The head was carried during the Reforma- 
tion to the Castle of Edinburgh, afterwards brought back to 
the manor-house of George Dury, Abbot of Dunfermline, 
delivered in 1597 to the Jesuits, who took it to Antwerp, 
and was ultimately placed in the chapel of the Scottish 
College at Douai, from which it disappeared during the 
troubles of the French Revolution. Some minor relics are 
said to have been acquired at Venice by Philip II. of Spain 
and deposited in the reliquary of the chapel of St Jerome 
in the church of St Lawrence at the Escurial, on the gates 
of which are, or were, full-length paintings of Margaret and 
Malcolm. On a search being recently made for the relics

at the instance of Dr Gillies, the Roman Catholic Bishop 
of Edinburgh, they could not be found. This is not sur- 
prising. Philip II. has been aptly called by Mr Ford a 
relicomaniac. He amassed the relics of more than five 
hundred separate saints, placed them in costly shrines, and 
housed them in the reliquary chamber or under the altars 
of the church of the Escurial. But the French general La 
Houssaye plundered the gold and silver of the shrines and 
scattered their contents. The doctrine that the same relics 
might be in different places at the same time, accepted by 
so little credulous a writer as John Major, gave ample room 
for their multiplication and little opportunity for their identi- 
fication. A singular good fortune has preserved the Gospel 
Book of Queen Margaret. After nearly eight centuries it 
seems almost certain that it has been rediscovered, and is now 
safely deposited in the Bodleian Library. A book, at least, 
whose date is vouched by the best authorities to be not 
later than the eleventh century, was acquired at a recent 
sale of books belonging to the parish of Brent Ely in Suffolk, 
and some of which had belonged to Lord Howard of 
Naworth : in it, besides miniatures of the four evangelists 
and other features answering to the description of Queen 
Margaret's book, the Latin verses on a blank leaf, after 
describing its loss and recovery, conclude with the lines — 

** Salvati semper sint Rex Reginaque sancta 
Quorum codex erat nuper salvatus ab undis

Within Dunfermline Abbey or its precincts more royal dust 
has mingled with the soil than in any other spot of Scotland 
save lona : Margaret, and by her side her husband, Canmore, 
brought from Tynemouth by the pious care of her son Alex- 
ander I.; .her sons, Edgar, and Alexander I., with his queen; 
David I., with his two queens; Malcolm IV.; Alexander III.,

with his first wife Margaret, and their sons David and Alex- 
ander ; Robert the Bruce, with his queen Elizabeth, and their 
daughter Matilda ; and Annabella Drummond, wife of Robert 
III. and mother of James, the first of his name and the best 
of his race. Margaret Logy, the wife of David II., brought 
from London tombs of alabaster for herself and her husband, 
which were erected at Dunfermline ; but as she was divorced, 
it is not likely she was buried there. David himself was 
buried at Hol&gt;Tood. 

No successor to Margaret has yet found a place in the 
Roman Calendar of Scottish Saints. Her son David re- 
ceived the title from his people, and was called by one of 
his successors a "sair saint for the Crown," so large were 
his gifts to the Church, but the Church never canonised its 
benefactor. At the urgent suit of Scottish Catholics Rome 
has for many years been considering the claim of Mary 
Stuart, but as yet hesitates. The decree in her favour, if it 
is given, will be based on different grounds from those which 
justify historians as well as divines in conferring it on Mar- 
garet. Mary may be deemed a martyr for the Catholic 
faith. Margaret was a confessor of the Christian life. In 
her the virtues of a woman were combined with those of 
a queen. Though she wrought no miracles like those of 
earlier saints, she exhibited the greater and rarer miracle of 
a life almost without fault. The age of pilgrimage is past. 
To organise one by railway trains is alien to the spirit which 
led, for several centuries, the barefoot pilgrims with staff 
and scrip to fast and pray at the shrine of Margaret. Man 
cannot turn back the hand of the dial. Yet the dweller in 
Dunfermline, or the stranger who passes its abbey, whatever 
creed he professes, may still recall with silent veneration how 
much the life of one good woman did for Scotland.

From the death of Margaret in 1093 to that of Alexander III. 
in 1286, a period of nearly two centuries, Scotland, and Fife 
as a part of it, grew in civilisation and prosperity. The Celtic 
period of the Scottish monarchy was at an end. It is not 
possible to date with precision the time when Gaelic ceased to 
be spoken in Fife. Canmore is the last of our kings who used 
Gaelic as his native language, but according to his wife's 
biography he knew English as well, and his mother was a 
Northumbrian. It is a proof of the long disuse of Gaelic in 
Fife, that while the place names are largely, the family names 
are now rarely, Celtic. There is no trace of a clan except 
the Macduff's and the Macbeths, and it is probable that both 
had their origin north of the Tay. None of those who are 
recorded as claiming the privilege of the Cross of Clan 
Macduff" bore the name, which shows that the clan system

ANGLO-SAXON INTERLUDE IN SCOTTISH HISTORY. 29 

had broken down in Fife. But in the earliest charters there 
are many Celtic names which have now disappeared, chiefly 
amongst the clergy and the serfs. The Saxon had a brief 
existence, like the interlude between the acts of a drama, 
almost conflned to the life of Malcolm and Margaret. 
Amongst the parties and witnesses to the charters, which 
are the best vouchers in such a matter, Anglo-Saxon or 
Danish names of landowners are rare in Fife. Merle 
Swain, who acquired lands at or near Kelly, and Orm, who 
acquired lands at Abernethy, are perhaps the only dis- 
tinctly Saxon names of owners of land which can be traced 
by charter evidence to the date of Malcolm Canmore. 
Norman names come into immediate contact with Celtic. 
There are only two Anglo-Saxon Bishops of St Andrews. 
Yet it is probable that a considerable number of Anglo- 
Saxons, and perhaps some Danes, settled in Fife, although 
they did not become the possessors of the largest fiefs or 
richest benefices. We cannot otherwise account for the 
early adoption of an Anglo-Saxon dialect, which has in the 
* Chronicle of Wyntoun ' one of its earliest representatives in 
literature. But there may have been a still earlier Teutonic 
migration to the eastern coast of Scotland, as to which history 
is silent The children of Malcolm and Margaret, especi- 
ally David I., who was educated at the Court of Henry I. 
of England, the husband of his sister Maud, were Norman 
in character, though not in blood. The cadets of Norman 
families began in the reigns of David I. and his successors 
the northern migration, and acquisition of lands and honours, 
which greatly facilitated the adoption of feudal customs and 
principles, and formed the only true Norman Conquest of Scot- 
land. This was carried out in Fife as far as, or further than, 
in any other part of Scotland. Nearly the whole land in the 
county passed into the hands of Norman proprietors, who in

some cases came direct from England, and in others settled 
first in other districts, and afterwards passed to Fife. The 
De Quinceys, the De Melvilles, the De Lundins, afterwards 
Lundies, the De Mowbrays, the De Mortimers, the De Wemyss, 
the De Candelles, from whom the Anstruthers trace their 
descent, the De Lascelles, the De Baliols, and the Oliphards 
or Oliphants, are early instances of Norman families some of 
who^e members held lands in Fife. Norman feudalism, begun 
under David as Prince of Cumbria, continued when he became 
king, and under his grandsons Malcolm the Maiden and 
William the Lion, his son Alexander II., and his grandson 
Alexander III., gradually spread over the whole kingdom. 
The Court became feudal, with the regular machinery of 
government conducted by the great officers of the King's 
Court, — the Chancellor, Justiciar, Steward, and Chamberlain, 
and the local Earls and Barons, who succeeded the Celtic 
Maormors and the Saxon Thanes, as the Sheriffs, or more 
probably their officers the Serjeants, succeeded the Mairs. 
David de Wemyss, who claimed descent from the Macduffs 
and lived in the reign of William the Lion, is the first Sheriff 
of Fife upon record. The land became feudalised, and was 
held of the king by the subordinate chain of vassals and sub- 
vassals. The burghs under David I., William the Lion, and 
their successors, were organised as exceptions from, or rather 
a^ modifications of, feudal tenure when applied to corporate 
bodies, within whose bounds trade was nurtured by the 
privileges of merchants and craftsmen. The Church was 
feudalised under bishops and abbots, who, adding acre to 
acre, and acquiring crofts and tofts in the burghs, became 
the richest Estate in the kingdom. Robert, Friar of the 
Augustinian monastery at Scone, became Bishop of St 
Andrews in succession to the Saxon Eadmar, who had 
followed the Anglian Turgot, and founded the Priory of St 
Andrews in the reign of David I. His successor, Arnold,

MACDUFF FEUDAL EARL OF FIFE. 3 1 

began in 11 60 to build the Cathedral, which was not com- 
pleted till 1328, by Bishop Lamberton. Such edifices re- 
quired several generations of architects and great revenues un- 
grudgingly applied to the service of the Church. The Royal 
Court or Curia J^egis, to which the direct vassals of the king 
alone came, was the great Council or Parliament. Scotland, 
outside of the Highlands, became as perfect an example of 
the feudal state as any country in Europe. The old Celtic 
Kingdom of Fife was subjected to the assimilating influence 
of feudalism along with the rest of Scotland. Macduff, the 
descendant of its Celtic chief or king, became a feudal Earl. 
No Thane of Fife is known in history ; but there were at least 
five thanages, one of which was Falkland, another Kinross. 
Macbeth is called Thane of Falkland in a record of 11 29, 
and the head of the Clan Macduff is called Thane of Fife 
by Wyntoun, probably as the successor to the lands held by 
Macbeth as Thane of Falkland. The first Earl of Fife was 
Ethelred, son of Malcolm Canmore and Margaret, who united 
with the earldom the abbacy of Dunkeld; but Constantine 
appears in the same charter with the same title, and seems 
to have been the representative of the Macduffs. The chief 
of that family retained, not so much as a reward for aiding 
Malcolm Canmore to defeat Macbeth, as from the position of 
his ancestors as independent rulers, the privileges of leading 
the van in battle, of placing the king, when crowned at Scone, 
on the Stone of Destiny, brought from Dunstaffnage, perhaps 
from Ireland (for that it came from the Holy Land, where it 
had served as Jacob's pillow, is a modern superstition), and the 
right of sanctuary and composition for his kin who committed 
murder in hot blood, in accordance with Celtic usage. The 
last privilege was associated with the cross of Clan Mac- 
duff, which so long stood on the hill above Newburgh. 
The mysterious inscription unfortunately disappeared before 
the scholars were born who might have read its meaning.

32 FIRST BURGHS IN FIFE. 

It was a combination of the custom of compensation for 
slaughter, common to the Celts and other races, with the 
ecclesiastical right of sanctuary, and might have been granted 
to the kin of any powerful chief. But the two former privi- 
leges appear to indicate a compromise between the greater 
king of Scotland and the representative of the lesser king of 
Fife, who retained a shadow of his former dignity in a cere- 
monial flattering to his vanity, and a place in war flattering to 
the pride of the men of the Kingdom. The armorial bear- 
ings of the earls with the royal lions rampant may have had 
a similar origin. 

The first burghs of Fife date from the feudal epoch. 
St Andrews and Inverkeithing received charters from David 
I. ; Dunfermline became a -burgh under the abbot as Lord 
of Regality in 1322 ; Kinghorn claims a charter from Alex- 
ander III. ; Crail received its charter from Robert the Bruce, 
and Cupar from David II. Amongst the founders of these 
early burghs were some of the industrious Flemings who 
contributed a small but not unimportant quota to the mixed 
population of Scotland. One of these, Maynard, was the 
first Provost of St Andrews. The other burghs of Fife were 
later creations of the Stuart kings. The clergy, not the 
burgesses, were the chief favourites of the earlier monarchs. 
The charter of the Dunfermline abbots was renewed and its 
estates enlarged by successive kings. The old grant of the 
Boar Chase {Cursus Apri) by the Pictish kings to St Andrews 
was confirmed by Alexander I. when his Arab charger with 
his Turkish trappings was led to the high altar as a symbol 
of the gift and a memorial of the Crusade. The monastery 
of Inchcolm was founded by the same pious monarch to 
commemorate his escape from shipwreck. The Abbey of 
Lindores was built and endowed by David Earl of Hunting- 
don, the brother of William the Lion, in gratitude for his safe

DEATH OF ALEXANDER III. AT KINGHORN. 33 

return from the Holy Land, and Balmerino by Alexander IL 
and his mother Ermengarde, widow of William the Lion. 

No prominent event occurred in Fife during this period of 
its history till the melancholy close of the reign of Alexander 
III. There are times when the annals of the past are as un- 
eventful as the life of a prosperous man. There are others 
when calamity follows calamity with rapid strokes. The years 
immediately preceding the War of Independence were of the 
latter kind. In 1280, David, younger son of Alexander III., 
died. Three years later he lost his daughter Margaret, the 
wife of Eric of Norway, and within the same year his elder 
son, Alexander, died at Cupar. On ist November 1285, 
hoping to secure a male heir, he married for a second time 
loleta, daughter of the Conte de Dreux. On 20th February, 
at a masque, in honour of the marriage at Jedburgh, a figure 
appeared like that which foretold Flodden to James IV. 
None could tell whether it was ghost or man, but imagination 
then or after the event deemed it the image or presage of 
death. On the i6th or 17 th of March, at the Castle of 
Dunbar, Thomas the Rhymer of Ercildoune, who died in 
1295, was heard to say a great wind would that day shake 
the kingdom. While those present mocked, a swift messen- 
ger of evil tidings came with news that Alexander had died 
by a fall from his horse as he rode, on a dark night, from 
Inverkeithing to Kinghorn. This is one of the memories 
of Fife preserved by tradition as well as history. A weird 
story tells how Michael Scot of Balwearie, near Kirkcaldy, 
having prophesied that a spirited and favourite charger of 
the king would cause his death, Alexander in a fit of passion 
stabbed it to death on the spot. Next year, as he rode 
another horse the same road, it saw the bleached bones of 
the earlier favourite, shied, and throwing the king, fulfilled 
the prophecy. Michael Scot, who died in 1290 or 1291,

34 MICHAEL SCOT OF BALWEARIE. 

was one of the early Scottish travellers, and became one of 
the celebrated schoolmen. Such, at least, was the opinion of 
Sir Walter Scott, though other writers think the identity of 
the magician with the laird of Balwearie is not proved. 
He passed from Fife to Oxford, from Oxford to Paris, 
from Paris to Toledo, where he learnt to read the Arabic 
translations of Aristotle, and acquiring the dubious character 
of a magician as well as a philosopher, was the hero of 
many stories. The exact spot of the king's death is disputed. 
The recent monument has been placed on the crag which 
overhangs the railway. The earlier chronicles seem to refer 
to the sands. No contemporary account has come down to 
our time, and the precise locality matters little. It was at all 
events near Kinghom, then a royal seat, to which Alexander 
was hurrying to his new bride. Much more important is the 
controversy as to his character. Scottish chroniclers with one 
voice celebrate the prosperity of his reign in contrast with the 
dark times which followed, when the death of the Maiden of 
Norway opened the disputed succession and gave an oppor- 
tunity for the fatal ambition of Edward I. But the chronicler 
of Lanercost casts vague hints against the morals of the king, 
and is followed by Knighton and other English writers. For- 
doun refutes these with a common saying, " Let no man 
question the salvation of this king because of his violent 
death; he who has lived well cannot die ill." The most 
authentic records confirm the strain of the patriotic ballad — 

" Quhen Alysander our King wes dede, 
That Scotland led in luve and le, 
Away wes sons of ale and brede, 
Of wine and wax and gamyn and gle. 
Our Gold was changyd in-to Lede.

WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. 35 

This was the epoch when England was engaged in its struggle 
for liberty against the despotic power of the Plantagenets, and 
the Scottish kings, who held large fiefs in England, sided with 
the English barons against their own arbitrary monarchs. The 
War of Independence was in fact a continuation of the same 
contest transferred to a different scene. If the liberties of the 
people were first affirmed at Runnymede, they were confirmed 
by Bannockburn. 

Fife played a small part in the War of Independence. It 
was again, as in the Roman period, outside the main current 
of Scottish history. The greatest battles of the war were 
fought in central or southern Scotland. The upper Forth, 
and not theTay, was its classic river; the carse between 
Stirling and Falkirk was its sacred ground. But Arnold 
or John Blair, a monk of the Benedictine Abbey of Dun- 
fermline, was the chaplain of Wallace. Macduff, the Earl of 
Fife, with the whole levy of the shire, fought and fell at the 
battle of Falkirk. One of the victories of Wallace was won 
at Black Ironside or Eamside, the forest of the alders near 
Newburgh. On his return from France, when Edward lay at 
Dunfermline, Wallace conducted his guerilla war from lurking- 
places in the same or some other forest of the west of Fife 
not yet stripped of its wood to found navies. If we may trust 
Blind Harry, and his credit has risen since documentary 
evidence has been found confirming parts of his poems 
formerly doubted, Wallace or his followers took Cupar, turned 
Edward's Bishop Fraser or perhaps Cumyn out of St Andrews, 
and recovered the forts of Kinghorn and on the castle island 
of Lochleven, so that 

**The Scottis at large through Fife they rang, 
Off Inglismen nayne left in that countrie." 

Edward I. more than once visited Dunfermline, and re- 
ceived at its high altar the empty homage of the Sheriff and

36 ROBERT THE BRUCE IN FIFE. 

Other nobles of Fife, which he recorded in the Ragman Rolls. 
On one of these visits he rewarded John, the son of John the 
Bailiff, for playing the Boy Bishop in the King*s Chapel, on 
the Eve of St Nicholas, 1303. In the following year, by his 
orders, the venerable monastery was burnt. The greatest of 
the Plantagenets held nothing sacred which was an obstacle 
to his ambition. 

The crown was placed on the head of Bruce by Isabella, 
Countess of Buchan, asserting the hereditary privilege of the 
Macduffs, when her brother Duncan, Earl of Fife, declined the 
dangerous honour. Edward I. rewarded the more patriotic 
sister, for discharging this office, by confining her in a cage 
hung on the walls of Berwick. The first part of the life of 
Bruce was spent fighting chiefly in the centre or the west of 
Scotland. When peace was won and the freedom of Scotland 
gained, Cardross on the Clyde was his favourite residence. 
He did not live at Dunfermline or at Scone. He only once 
visited St Andrews, on the memorable day, the 5th of July 
1 31 8, when Bishop William of Lamberton, seven bishops, 
fifteen abbots, and many "other great gentlemen, of whom 
Bruce was the greatest," took part in the dedication of the 
cathedral. But as death drew near, he made preparations to 
lay his bones beside those of his royal predecessors. A marble 
tomb, surrounded with an iron gilt railing and surmounted by 
a canopy of painted Baltic timber, was ordered from Paris, and 
erected, perhaps while he yet lived, in Dunfermline Abbey. 
The abbot received an offering to provide masses for his 
soul. There the earthly remains of the patriot king were 
laid, near where the pulpit stands, not far from the first resting- 
place of the saintly queen. Robert Burns, when he visited 
Dunfermline in 1787, knelt and kissed the broad flagstone 
which then covered the grave of Robert Bruce, and heartily 
execrated the worse than Gothic neglect of the first of Scottish

heroes. The spot is now marked by a porphyry slab which 
once covered the tomb of an Eastern emperor. In 1818 the 
skeleton was found with the breast-bone sawn through to 
allow the removal of the heart, which, after being carried by 
the good Douglas to the Moorish war in Spain, now rests in 
Melrose, and at Dunfermline the bones of Bruce were rein- 
terred. The skeleton, one who saw it told me, was that of a 
man not above the ordinary height. The skull was low and 
long-shaped, rather than high and broad. Some of the teeth 
were still in the sockets. The frayed fragments of the dress 
in which he was buried were carried off as relics. Even 
minutiae have an interest when they relate to so great a man. 
However successful may be the endeavour to discover the 
laws of history, and its success is as yet limited, patriotism 
will continue to honour its heroes as religion reveres its saints. 

When Edward Baliol and the disinherited barons, aided by 
Edward III., recovered Scotland in the reign of David II., one 
of the strongholds which escaped capture was the castle of 
Lochleven, commanded by a gallant captain, Alan de Vypont, 
who, by a brilliant sally and the protection of St Serf, says 
Fordoun, stormed the fort the English had erected in the 
kirkyard of Kinross. In 1335 one of the few Parliaments 
ever held in Fife sat in the castle of Dairsie, which, through 
the jealousy of the nobles and the want of wisdom of the 
young Steward then regent, afterwards Robert II., did nothing 
for the national defence. 

A period of nearly a century passed before Fife was again 
the scene of an important event in Scottish history. It was 
another tragedy. The muse of history rarely wears the comic 
mask. The place was Falkland, so named either from the 
ruddiness of the soil, or more probably from the falcons used 
when hawking was the favourite sport. It had originally been 
a castle or hunting tower of the Earls of Fife, the foundations

of which, buried under the garden of the palace of the Jameses, 
have been recently excavated by Lord Bute. In 137 1 it 
was transferred with the earldom to Robert Stewart, E^l of 
Monteith, second son of Robert IL, afterguards created Duke 
of Albany. This ambitious and energetic man, owing to the 
weak health of his father and the weak character of his 
brother, Robert IIL, governed Scotland for the greater part of 
two reigns. There seems little doubt that he aimed at the 
"crown. His conduct was glossed over by the clerical his- 
torians, in whose eyes his hatred of heretics atoned for crime, 
and has found modern apologists. But the facts are too 
strong for silence or special pleading. Res ipsa loquitur. The 
Duke of Rothesay, eldest son of Robert III., stood in his 
way. In 1399, Rothesay, on attaining majority, not un- 
naturally superseded Albany in the office of governor, and 
showed, like some other princes, signs of a vigorous manhood 
succeeding a dissipated youth. The ducal title, then first in- 
troduced in Scotland, and bestowed with specious equality both 
on Rothesay and Albany, was an insufficient bribe to satisfy one 
who had already exercised regal authority. Two years later, 
when Rothesay was on his road to St Andrews to take posses- 
sion of its castle on the death of Bishop Trail, he was waylaid 
as he passed Strathtyrum, and taken to Falkland, where, after 
a brief captivity, he died, illustrating the saying that the dis- 
tance is short between a royal prison and a royal tomb. ' Tra- 
dition has ascribed his death to starvation ; and while it names 
Sir William Lindsay of Rossie and Sir John of Ramornie as 
the authors of his arrest, and two inferior agents, Selkirk and 
Wright of Falkland, as the immediate perpetrators of the 
murder, his uncle Albany, and Archibald Tyneman, the son 
of the grim Earl of Douglas his father-in-law, and the husband 
of his sister, were believed to have been its instigators. The 
tale of the woman who kept him alive for a little with milk

FOUNDATION OF ST ANDREWS UNIVERSITY. 39 

from her breast, introduced by a reed into his dungeon, and 
of another who supplied him with a scanty meal of oats, his 
feeding on his own flesh, and the miracles performed by his 
corpse at Lindores, where his empty stone coffin may perhaps 
be still seen, were fictitious additions to heighten the gloom 
of the dark story. The Act of Parliament which declared in 
the official religious phraseology of the. time that he migrated 
from the light by divine Providence, and not otherwise, yet, 
at the same time, absolving Albany and Douglas from being 
parties to the death, has been reasonably cited by historians, 
like the similar remission to Bothwell from any share in Dam- 
ley's murder, as a confirmation of guilt. The sudden despatch 
to France of his younger brother, afterwards James I., who was 
captured by the English on his way, is a further corroboration 
of the dread of his uncle. Albany at once resumed the office 
of Governor, and after the death of Robert III. did all he 
could to delay the ransom of the young king. 

From these sad stories of the death of kings, we turn with 
pleasure to the next event in the history of Fife worthy of 
record in such a sketch as the present. This was the founda- 
tion of the University of St Andrews, the first University of 
Scotland. The substitution for the Monastery of the Univer- 
sity is not the least of many instances of what may fairly be 
called historical development. An institution which had served 
its time, gave place to another, whose time had come. It was 
a moment of far-reaching consequence, when in country after 
country in Europe the doors of cloisters were opened, not to 
enclose monks, but to nurture and send forth scholars. This 
was a gift of the old Church, but it carried with it the seeds 
of the Reformation wherever, as in Scotland, they were cast 
on a congenial soil The poverty of the early apostolic days 
of the Church had been succeeded by superabundant wealth. 
A pious Catholic, John Major, the Provost of St Salvator's,

40 BISHOP WARDLAW PROCURES THE BULLS. 

laments the corruption of the religious orders both of men 
and women ; the abuses of alien and absentee abbots ; the 
plurality of benefices ; the prodigality of prelates, which, out- 
lasting their own lives, vainly aimed at an earthly immor- 
tality in their sumptuous tombs. It might have been ex- 
pected, he says, that they would sooner have thought of 
founding a University. That of St Andrews, it is fair to re- 
member, erected by Bishop Wardlaw, still lives, and still gives 
a sound education to students, and a modest endowment to 
learning, while the monuments of his predecessors and suc- 
cessors have crumbled into dust. 

In the year 141 1, marked in the history of Scotland by 
the battle of Harlaw, and of Europe by the summons of the 
Council of Constance, the Studium Generale or University 
of St Andrews was opened by Henry Wardlaw the Bishop, 
and James Bisset the Prior. Two years after, on Saturday, 
3d February, the day after the Feast of the Purification of 
the Virgin, Henry of Ogilvie, a Master of Arts, landed at St 
Andrews from Spain. He brought the bulls by which the 
Spanish Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII., granted at Paniscola, in 
Aragon, its first privileges to the University at the request 
nominally of James I., still a prisoner in England, and really 
of Bishop Wardlaw. But the King after his return to his 
kingdom showed himself a steady friend of the University. 
He had spent a part of his boyhood in the Castle of St 
Andrews under the care of Bishop Wardlaw, who became one 
of his leading councillors. John Cameron, his secretary, 
afterwards Bishop of Glasgow, and several of his most trusted 
officers of State, had been amongst the early students of St 
Andrews. When Ogilvie entered the city gates the bells of all 
the churches rang in his honour. Next day, Sunday, 4th of 
February', at nine, there was a congregation of the clerg)% 
when the bulls were presented and read to the Bishop as first

CEREMONY ON THEIR RECEPTION. 4I 

Chancellor. A procession followed to the high altar of the 
cathedral, where the Mass of the Holy Spirit was celebrated 
by the Prior, and a Te Deum chanted. The Bishop of Ross 
read the collect, ^^ Deus qui cor da hominum gubemat" 
preached the sermon, and pronounced the blessing. The 
beadle counted in the procession four hundred clerks in orders, 
besides deacons and novices, and a large host of people. 
St Andrews has never before or since seen a brighter sight 
or a happier day. The remainder of it, and the night which 
followed, were given up to popular rejoicings, bonfires, sing- 
ing, dancing, feasting, and the ringing of bells. 

For at least two centuries before this there had been 
schools in many monasteries in which poor as well as rich 
boys had been instructed, but there had been no provision 
for the higher learning, or for what is now called a liberal 
education. The Scot who wished to complete his studies 
and obtain a degree had at great cost and some risk, requir- 
ing a safe-conduct if he were rich, and begging for alms if he 
were poor, to resort to Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, or Bologna. 
It was to obviate these inconveniences by founding a uni- 
versity in Scotland that the six bulls of Benedict were granted. 
They provided for the study of theology, canon and civil law, 
arts, medicine, and other- lawful faculties, power to grant 
degrees, exemption of the members of the University from 
taxes, and a licence of non-residence by the professors at the 
benefices from which they drew their salaries. The students 
were divided into the four nations of Fife, Angus, Albany, 
and Lothian. 

Wardlaw, in anticipation of these privileges, had already 
drawn round him a group of learned men. Lawrence of 
Lindores, less favourably known as the inquisitor of heresy, 
had already taught the sentences of Peter Lombard, the text- 
book of divinity; and Richard Cornwall, Archdeacon of

42 THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS COLLEGES. 

Lothian, had lectured on the canon law. William Stephen, 
afterwards Bishop of Dunblane; John Litstar, Canon, and 
Doctor of the Canon Law ; John Scheves, Official, and John 
Schevez, Archdeacon, of St Andrews, also taught in the same 
faculty, but probably not during the same period ; John Gill, 
William Fowler, and William Croiser lectured in philosophy 
and logic. There were in all thirteen doctors of theology and 
eight doctors of law who either then or soon after took part in 
the studies. The University of St Andrews had now what a 
medieval proverb called its "soul," the privileges which no 
one but a pope was deemed competent to confer; but it 
lacked both endowments and a home. The latter was given 
by the same bishop in 1430, who conferred on it a tene- 
ment at first called the Paedagogium or St John's, and after- 
wards, when enlarged in 1537, the New College or St 
Mary's. St Salvator's was founded in 145 1 by Bishop 
Kennedy, and St Leonard's in 151 2 by Alexander Stuart, 
the Archbishop, and Prior Hepburn. Wardlaw, as might 
be expected from this example, was one of the liberal 
and zealous prelates who adorned the diocese. To him it 
owes the Guard Bridge, near the mouth of the Eden, as it 
does to a later bishop, James Beaton, more probably than 
Spottiswoode, the bridge at Dairsie. His hospitality was 
without stint. On one occasion his steward begged him at 
least to name his guests. The bishop replied, "The two 
first are Fife and Angus." The steward did not ask the 
name of the third. Though so liberal in spending his own 
means, he denounced the luxury beginning to spread with 
the increase of wealth. He died in 1440, and was buried 
by the wall beween the Choir and the Lady Chapel. His 
epitaph claimed as his chief praise that he was the founder 
of the university.

A SUCCESSION of vigorous bishops, who reigned at St An- 
drews like little kings, had a great influence on the progress 
of Fife. Its earliest patrons had been the kings, its second 
were the bishops. They endowed its churches, protected and 
enlarged its University, and confirmed St Andrews in the posi- 
tion of the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland Here they can 
only be named with a word to indicate their character. 

James Kennedy, the founder of St Salvator's College, who 
succeeded Wardlaw, was the wise councillor of two kings, and 
a regent during the minority of James III. But John Major 
the historian blames his extravagant expenditure on his barge 
and tomb, as economists nowadays deplore the cost of iron- 
clads and the incomes of prelates and princes. 

Patrick Graham gained for the see the coveted archi-episco-

pal pall ; but quarrelling with the Pope, and envied by the 
other bishops, perhaps a Reformer before the Reformation, 
he was deposed, and died a prisoner in St Serfs Inch on 
Lochleven. 

William Schevez, who supplanted him, was an ambitious 
and worldly Churchman of the type of Wolsey, a man of 
versatile talent and much learning, a lover of books and 
an expert in astrology. His books form the nucleus of 
the library of the University of St Andrews. 

James Stewart, Duke of Ross, son of James III., suc- 
ceeded. His graceful bearing, celebrated by Ariosto, dis- 
guised the fatal error of filling the see with a prince of the 
royal blood. 

The error was followed and exceeded when James IV. 
made it a provision for his son Alexander. It was a strange 
form of union of Church and State that the highest office of 
the Church should be held by a royal bastard. When kings 
made and popes sanctioned appointments of this kind, what 
could be expected from those below them except imitation 
by bad and condemnation by good men ? The foundation 
of St Leonard's by the youthful archbishop was a natural 
and graceful act of a favourite pupil of Erasmus. Yet there 
are signs in the correspondence and conduct of Alexander 
Stewart, with whom history has dealt gently, that it was 
perhaps well for his fame he fell at Flodden. 

Andrew Foreman, formerly Bishop of Moray, who held the 
Priory of Cottingham in England and the See of Bourges in 
France, was another ambitious Churchman who obtained the 
primacy against powerful competitors by adroit policy, and 
administered its revenues with liberality; but his French 
interests made him an unfortunate adviser for James V. 

The two Beatons of the family of Balfour, uncle and 
nephew, James the Archbishop, and David the Cardinal,

raised the see to a perilous and giddy height, the prelude 
of a fall. 

The reigns of the five Jameses, which covered nearly a 
centur)' and a half, do not, so far as Fife was concerned, 
apart from what might be called the almost domestic annals 
of the bishops at St Andrews and the kings at Falkland, 
afford matter illustrative of the greater events in Scottish 
history. But a few incidents may be glanced at to indicate 
the current which brought Fife, like the rest of Scotland, 
through the transition from the middle ages to the eve of 
the Reformation. 

James I. received the crown of Scotland at Scone from 
the hands of his cousin Murdoch, Duke of Albany, as Earl 
of Fife. It \vas the last time this office was discharged. 
Within a year Albany was tried and beheaded for treason. 
The earldom was forfeited to the Crown, and Fife ceased 
to be represented by a great feudal lord. The king seized 
the Tower of Falkland, but, perhaps on account of the 
memory of his brother's death, did not make it his home. 

When James I. was about to cross the Firth to Fife on 
his last journey to Perth he was warned by the weird 
prophecy of an old Highland spaewife that if he passed 
that way he would never return. Within a few weeks he 
met his tragic fate at Perth. Perth and Scone, and not any 
royal palace in Fife or Lothian, had been his favourite resi- 
dences. The horror caused by his death is said to have 
combined with other circumstances in depriving Perth of its 
preference as a royal residence. Linlithgow, Stirling, Dun- 
fermline, Falkland, and Holyrood were the favourite palaces 
of the succeeding kings, and Edinburgh grew rapidly into 
the position of a capital. Its vicinity to Edinburgh gave 
Fife a character it has since held as one of the most con- 
venient retreats from business to the healthy pleasures of

the country and the seaside. The royal family went to 
Falkland and St Andrews, and courtiers and subjects fol- 
lowed the example, as in our day they have followed the 
Queen to Deeside. 

The reigns of the second and the third James were chiefly 
occupied with the struggle between the Crown and the 
Border house of Douglas. Fife lay outside of the scene of 
this contest, and was reputed to be the most peaceful part 
of the kingdom. One of the Douglases, James, the ninth 
earl, died at the Abbey of Lindores in 1488, the same year 
his successful adversary James III. fell at Sauchie. When 
sent there as a prisoner, he is said to have muttered — "He 
who can no better be, must be a monk." Times had altered 
since Constantine, the Celtic king, had deemed the tonsure 
more honourable than the crown, and become a monk at 
St Andrews. 

The little towns which girdle the shores of Fife from 
Queensferry to St Andrews, and from St Andrews to New- 
burgh, were during this period busy havens of foreign trade. 
The commerce of the Forth was chiefly with France and the 
Low Countries, but also with the ports of the North Sea and 
the Baltic. At these towns, or on the opposite coast of the 
Firth, most of the Scottish ships were built Bruce had made 
the first experiment of a Scottish navy with the foresight 
which marked his character, anticipating the later day when 
the seas were to bring Scotland a more plentiful harvest than 
its soil. He had few imitators, till Bishop Kennedy built his 
barge, the St Salvator, which cost as much as his college of 
the same name and his too ostentatious tomb, and James IV. 
the St Michael. The woods of Fife were now largely used 
for shipbuilding. The men of Fife were amongst the hardiest 
sailors. Sir Michael of Wemyss was the first Scottish admiral. 

Two sea-battles, which are the first on record illustrating

SIR ANDREW WOOD OF LARGO. 47 

the infancy both of the Scottish and the English navies, were 
closely connected with Fife. In 1499, Sir Andrew Wood 
of Largo, the best of the councillors of James III. and the 
trusted adviser of his son, with two ships, the Yellow Carvel 
and the Mayflower, captured Stephen Bull, the English ad- 
miral, and three ships at the back of the May — 

" The battle fiercely it was fought 
Near to the Craig of Bass ; 
When we next fight the English loons, 
May nae waur come to pass. " 

Bull was sent home without ransom, but with the boastful 
message to the English king that James had as manful men 
by sea and land in Scotland as there were in England ; and 
that if the English king disturbed Scottish waters, his ships 
and sailors would not be so well treated in future. Wood 
sided with James III., and a false rumour spread that the 
king took refuge in his ship after the battle of Sauchie. If 
we could credit Pitscottie, the young king mistook the admiral 
for his father, but Wood declared he was only a trusty ser- 
vant, who would avenge the death of his master. The same 
writer gives a quaint account of the trial of Lord David 
Lindsay of the Byres, and his successful defence by Patrick 
Lindsay his brother, who cast the indictment by pointing out 
that the day for the trial was past, when '* Lord David was so 
blythe at his brother's sayings that he burst forth, *Verrilie, 
brother, ye have fyne pyatt wordis. I wold not have trowed, 
be St Amaric, that ye had sick wordis,' and said to him, for 
that dayes labour he should have the Mains of Kirkforthar." 
But the young king, who had been by another plea of the 
bold advocate excluded from the Court, was so displeased that 
he said he would send him " where he should not see his feet 
for a year," and imprisoned him in a dungeon of the royal 
castle in Bute.

48 CAREER AND DEATH OF ANDREW BARTON. 

Andrew, the eldest of three sons of John Barton, a mer- 
chant skipper of Leith, the commander of the Yellow Carvel, 
continuing Wood's exploits, cleared the Forth of pirates, made 
reprisals on the Flemish, the Portuguese, and the English 
for injuries to Scottish merchantmen, and was sent by James 
IV. to aid his uncle, Hans of Denmark, against the Swedes 
and Lubeck. Hans charged him, in a letter to Henry VIII., 
with making off with the vessel James intended as a present 
to Hans. It brought him no luck, for it appears to have 
been the Lyon, the ship in which the bold sailor, who was 
the terror of the seas from the Baltic and the Sound to the 
coasts of Brittany and the English Channel, and had sent 
James three barrels filled with the heads of Flemish pirates, 
at last met his own doom. A similar present was sent the 
other day to the Emperor of Morocco. The repetitions of 
history enable us to measure distances in the advance of 
civilisation. At the instance of some traders of Newcastle 
who had suffered from his piracy, Henry VIII. commissioned 
Edward Howard, son of the Earl of Surrey, who volunteered 
to put down Barton. He succeeded in taking his famous 
ship in an engagement off Northumberland, during which 
her commander was shot through the heart. The Lyon 
became the second man-of-war in the navy of England. 
The body of Barton was cast into the sea, though the head, 
according to the English ballad, was carried in triumph to 
London : — 

" Then in came the queen and ladies fair 
To see Sir Andrew Bartun, knight ; 
They weened that he was brought on shore, 
And thought to have seen a gallant sight. 

But when they see his deadly face, 

And eyes so hollow in his head, 

* I would give,* quoth the king, * a thousand marks. 

This man were alive as he is dead.* "

THE GREAT ST MICHAEL. 49 

Scottish historians, however, record a contemptuous answer 
of Henry that kings should not concern themselves with the 
fate of pirates, which does not accord with the more generous 
sentiment attributed to him by the ballad. Robert, another 
of the brothers, or Hob a Barton, as he was nicknamed by 
the English, became Controller of the Exchequer of Scotland 
in the reign of James V. Vengeance for the death of Andrew 
Barton was one of the causes which led to the campaign of 
Flodden. It had been intended to fight by sea as well as 
by land; and the great St Michael, which is called by the 
Scottish chronicler the largest ship ever yet seen, had been 
built for the purpose. She took so much timber as to waste 
all the woods of Fife except Falkland, besides pines imported 
from the forests of Norway. Her cost, apart from her artil- 
lery, was ;;^3o,ooo. She was two hundred and forty feet 
long, fifty-six broad, and carried thirty-five cannons, besides 
smaller guns; her crew was three hundred seamen besides 
officers, one thousand men-at-arms, and one hundred and 
twenty gunners. Wood was her master, and John Barton 
his skipper ; but this vessel, like the Great Eastern of our 
day, was found too unwieldy, and after Flodden was sold to 
the King of France. 

While the seaports were resounding with hammer and 
anvil, in the inland towns, Dunfermline, Cupar, Auchter- 
muchty, and Newburgh, as well as in the scattered cottages 
which then as now varied the grey landscape with red-tiled 
or thatched roofs overgrown with green and yellow moss, the 
spindle was busily plied by housewives and spinsters. The 
farmers of Fife commonly cultivated not only oats, bear, and 
some wheat, but lint. Linen for the table and the bed, as 
well as woollen cloth for clothes, were woven, chiefly for 
home use; but already the markets had opened for the 
future linen trade. Henryson, the poet - schoolmaster of

so THE CASTLES OF FIFE. 

Dunfermline, describes the manufacture of flax nearly four 
hundred years ago as it continued till the factory and steam- 
engine superseded the spindle and the hand-loom : — 

" The lint ryipit, the carll pullit the lyne, 
Rippillit the bollis, and in beitis set, 
It steipit in the burne, and dryit syne, 
And with ane betill knokkit it, and bett, 
Syne swingillit it weill, and hekillit in the flet, 
I lis wyfe it span, and twynit it in to threid." 

The muster of Fife, led by Lindsay of the Byres, fought 
for James III. at Sauchieburn, and may be traced as a 
distinct contingent in Scottish armies in other battles ; but it 
was the boast of the county, if somewhat exaggerated, yet 
in the main true, that, since the Danish raids, its soil had 
seldom been stained with blood. The castles in surprising 
variety, of all sizes and kinds, great houses such as St 
Andrews, Struthers, Wemyss, Earlshall, Collessie, Kellie, 
Balgonie, Balcomie, Ravenscraig, Craighall, down to little 
towers like Scotstarvit, Denmyln, Rumgally, and Tullibole, 
continued to be built during several centuries. These were 
signs of the continued existence of feudal lords and lairds ; 
but, except the Bishop's Castle at St Andrews, they were not 
places of great strength like the Border keeps and peels, or 
the grand baronial castles of Lothian, Angus, Aberdeen, and 
the Highlands. No district of Scotland was probably so 
little disturbed by fighting before the wars of the sixteenth 
century, though there were occasional exceptions, as the siege 
of Reres. 

James IIL began, James IV. continued, and James V. 
completed the conversion of the Earl's Tower at Falkland 
into the palace. A new house exorcised old memories, and 
the scene of Rothesay's murder became a resort of the Court. 
Here, and at Dunfermline, James IV. and James V. diverted

themselves, their Commons as well as their Court, with amuse- 
ments and with sport. 

James V. lived in Fife more than his father or grandfather. 
It was from Falkland that he made his ride by night with 
Jockie Hart and another Privy - Chamber boy to Stirling, 
when he escaped from the custody of Angus. The butts 
at St Andrews were the scene of the archery match be- 
tween six gentlemen and yeomen of Scotland and the same 
number of England, when the King won the bet with his 
mother of ;^ioo and a tun of wine. Pitscottie gives the 
names of the victors, who were remembered, as the winners 
of a famous boat race or football match are now, for at least 
one generation. " David Wemyss of that ilk, David Arnot of 
that ilk, Mr John Wedderburn, Vicar of Dundee, were the 
gentlemen, and the yeomen John Thomson in Leith, Steven 
Taberner, and a piper Alexander Baillie." In his triumphal 
progress through the kingdom with his first wife, Madeline of 
France, he visited St Andrews and Cupar, and the fragile Lily 
of France was sent to Balmerino as the best air in Scotland. 
In the Cathedral of St Andrews he was wedded by David 
Beaton to Mary of Lorraine or Guise, who landed a few days 
before at Fife Ness. She entered the Abbey under a trium- 
phal arch erected at the New Gate, where a Masque had been 
designed by Sir David Lyndsay. It represented a fair lady 
like an angel descending from a cloud, to whom the keys of 
the city were handed in token that all hearts in Scotland were 
open to her. Next morning she made a pretty speech to her 
husband that " she never saw in France so many good faces 
in so little room as she saw that day in Scotland." Before 
she died the Masques and Faces had changed, and there 
was, as we shall soon see, an end of her pretty speeches. 
After the news of the disaster at Solway Moss and of the 
birth of Mary Stuart, James gave up the ghost, his mind

wandering, and his lips muttering some of the saddest words 
ever spoken on a deathbed. " *The devil go with it ! It will 
end as it began ; it came from a woman, and it will end in a 
woman.' After that not many words that were sensible. But 
ever he harpt upon his old song. * Fy ! fled Oliver ? Is Oliver 
tane ? All is lost ! ' " Oliver was a cadet of the Sinclairs of 
Dysart, Earls of Rosslyn, the unfortunate favourite and general 
of the dying king. 

The green of Falkland, like that of Peebles or of Christ's 
Kirk, which some suppose to have been Leslie, was the fre- 
quent scene of dancing and revelry. Several of the comic 
poems of Dunbar relate to incidents in the life of the Court 
at Falkland, as the "Ballad of Kind Kittock " and "The 
King's Wooing." Blind Harry, there is little doubt, often 
recited his verses to the Court there, and it is an interesting 
fact that the two earliest manuscripts of Barbour's " Bruce " 
and the unique manuscript of Blind Harry's " Wallace " were 
copied by John Ramsay, a Chaplain at Lochmalony in Fife, 
at the request of Sir Symon, the vicar of that parish. Its 
woods and neighbouring hills were suitable ground for hawk- 
ing and hunting : — 

** Fareweill Falkland, the fortalice of Fife — 
Thy polite park under the Lomond low — 
Sum tyme in thee I led ane lusty life, 
Thy fallow deer to see them rake in row." 

Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount, from whom these lines 
are quoted, who matriculated at St Andrews along with David 
Beaton the Cardinal in 1509, and who taught young James V. 
to lisp " Pa Da Lin " to the music of his lute, was the best 
known of the many authors from Wyntoun to Spottiswoode, 
whose names are associated with the county. The same 
pungent and popular comic vein which Lyndsay cultivated 
runs through the early ballads of Fife — "Symmie and his

Brodir," "The Wyf of Auchtermuchty," "The Wowing of 
Jok and Jeny," by unknown writers, and "Ane Description 
of Peder Coffer" (the Pedlar), which has been ascribed to 
Lyndsay himself. It has been the peculiarity of the poets 
of Fife, with one or two exceptions, to seize the ludicrous 
rather than the pathetic aspect of life. Perhaps on this 
account its prose is superior to its verse. Good Scottish 
prose is rarer than Scottish verse, and no better prose is to 
be found than in the Chronicles of Lindsay of Pitscottie, 
Sir James Melville of Halhill, the courtier, and James 
Melville, the minister of Anstruther. Lyndsay himself 
mixes prose with verse, and may perhaps be not unjustly 
called the least imaginative of our Scottish poets. He is 
also the best representative of Fife amongst the early 
authors of Scotland. Two illustrations of the history of 
Fife find their record in Lyndsa/s works, for he was one 
of the men of letters who was also a man of action. One 
of these was his acted play, the satire or drama of "The 
Three Estates." The " Murder of Cardinal Beaton " was a 
real tragedy, in which he played the part of an interested 
spectator, and on which he afterwards wrote the " Tragedy of 
the Cardinal." The scene of the former was at Cupar, that 
of the latter at St Andrews.

KNOX — THE CHURCH IN SCOTLAND, WHICH REJECTED THE REFORMS

MODEL OF CALVIN. 



Scotland has no native Theatre, no national Drama. Its 
children have never been deficient in poetic gifts. It has 
even identified itself somewhat proudly with the north country, 
the country famed for song. Scotland, too, had, in common 
with all Europe during the middle ages, miracle and passion 
plays, moralities and interludes, school plays and plays of 
Robin Hood, even plays where we should least expect them, 
during the audit of the Exchequer, to amuse the Auditors of 
the Accounts. Dunbar's " Interlude of the Droichis Part of 
the Play" was composed for some lost comedy acted in 
Edinburgh when Margaret Tudor came to wed James IV. 
It had also the masques and pageants which, when touched 
by the enchanter's wand at the right moment, produced 
the Shakesperian drama. For Scotland that moment never 
came. Before it Sir David Lyndsay and several known and 
many forgotten poets had made rude essays to introduce the

THE REFORMATION AND THE DRAMA. 55 

drama. But the Reformation, its prelude, its acts, and its 
epilogue, filled the thoughts of Scotsmen with the graver busi- 
ness of life and death. When murders were being acted at 
St Andrews, Holyrood, and the Kirk-of-Field, and the stake 
and the gallows were familiar objects of everyday life, it was 
no time for the mimic tragedy, still less for the comedy of the 
stage. To the good as well as the evil side of the Calvinistic, 
Puritan, Covenanting spirit, the theatre became more hateful 
than the old poetry of Greece had been to the philosopher of 
the Republic. That it might perhaps have been otherwise is 
shown by the drama of Lyndsay. He lived in the interval 
between the Renaissance and the Reformation, near enough 
the age of the miracle-play and the masque to imitate them 
in a different class of subject, but too far before the age of 
dramatic poetry to be moved by its potent spirit. Later Re- 
formers agreed to forget that one of the first of their number 
was a writer of plays. Nor was Lyndsay the only Scots Re- 
former who used the drama. The plays of George Buchanan 
were concealed in Latin and acted abroad. But a drama 
entitled "The Siege and Taking of the Castle of Edinburgh" 
was played in St Andrews in 1572. On the opposite shore 
of the Tay, at Dundee, James Wedderburn, a brother of the 
author of the *Gude and Godlie Ballates,' had, before 1540, 
converted the histories of John the Baptist and Dionysius the 
Tyrant into plays, which were acted at Dundee, and in which 
he " carped roughlie the abuses and corruptions of the Papists, 
counterfeiting their lying impostures and miracles." He was 
denounced as a heretic, and fled to France, where he died at 
Dieppe or Rouen. That Lyndsay escaped a similar fate was 
probably due to the favour of his old pupil, James V. 

Let us try to picture the scene which drew spectators from 
all parts of Fife to the little hill in the centre of Cupar where 
the schoolboys of to-day play their innocent and happy games,

56 SATIRE OF "THE THREE ESTATES." 

on Whitsun Tuesday, the 7th of June, in the year 1552. 
The local allusions leave little doubt that one of the three 
known representations was, as was natural for the work of a 
Fife author, at the head burgh of the county : it had already 
been acted at Linlithgow before the king on the first day of 
the Epiphany in 1549, and it was afterwards performed in 
presence of the Queen Regent at Greenside, near Edinburgh, 
in 1554. Some days or weeks before the performance at 
Cupar it was advertised, probably on the market-day. There 
were then no newspapers or printed advertisements, but two 
or three of the actors strolled into the market and played an 
interlude to excite curiosity. 

A messenger appeared, and addressing the crowd, said : — 

** Richt famous Pepill, ye sail understand, 

How that ane Prince, richt wyiss and vigilant, 
Is shortly for to cum in to this land ; 

And purposis to hold ane Parliament, 
His Thre Estaits thairto hes done consent, 

In Cowpar Toun, in to thair best array, 
With support of the Lord Omnipotent, 

And thairto hes affixt ane certane day." 

An old cottar next came on the scene and declared his wish 
to be present — 

" And drink a quart at Cowpar Toun 
Wi* my gossip Johne Williamson," 

but fears his " quick devil of a wife " will prevent him. That 

worthy herself arrives, and justifies his description by soundly 

rating her husband, whom she orders to stay at home and 

watch the kye while she attends the play. They are still 

squabbling when Fyndlaw of the Footband, an arrant coward 

who had fled from Pinkie Cleuch, appears and boasts of his 

exploits, ending with the prayer "The great God of his 

grace " — 

" To send us weir and never peace, 

That I may fecht my fill."

PLOT OF THE PLAY. $7 

After this braggadocio speech, according to the stage direction 
he characteristically but inconsistently lies down. A fool 
then plays a trick on the old man at the suggestion of his 
wife, and puts Fyndlaw's courage to the proof with a sheep's 
head on a staff. Before this formidable weapon the fighting 
captain flies in terror for his life. The messenger ends the 
interlude by again announcing the date of the play: — 

" As for this day I haf nae mair to say you, 
On Whitsone Tysday cum see our play I pray you ; 
That samine day is the Sevinth day of June, 
Thairfoir get up right airly and disjune" (i.^., breakfast). 

On the 7th June accordingly, at seven in the morning, for 
early rising was then the habit, every man, woman, and child 
who could get there gathered on the Castlehill, and the play, 
not quite punctually, began on the play-field. It consisted 
of seven parts or interludes loosely strung together. Lyndsay 
acted on Goethe's sage stage maxim that the manager who 
brings much brings something for everybody. The first part 
is the tale of the temptation of King Humanity by Dame 
Sensuality ; the second is the cheating of a poor man by a 
Roman Pardonmonger selling indulgences and absolutions; 
the third is a sermon by Folly ; in the fourth. King Humanity 
again appears, and is misled by Flattery, Deceit, and False- 
hood, who in the fifth part overcome Verity and Chastity; 
the sixth is the Parliament of Correction, from which the 
drama takes its name of " The Satyre of the Thrie Estates," 
whose acts are drawn with a view to refonn the abuses then 
prevalent both in Church and State ; and the whole ends with 
the punishment of the Vices. Such is the briefest possible 
account of a play full of diverse and pregnant matter. It 
might seem incredible, if we had not the testimony of one 
who saw it acted at Greenside, that it took nine hours to 
perform. The audience having breakfasted well after the

58 EFFECT OF THE SATIRE. 

Scotch fashion, were, however, as in the Wagner representa- 
tions at Baireuth, allowed intervals for refreshment. Both 
collation or luncheon and dinner are included in the time 
of performance, and if they followed the advice of the mes- 
senger who announced the play, 

" With gude stark w&gt;'iie your flacconis see ye fill," 

they probably did not limit one part of their refreshment to 
stated intervals. 

The performance was in the open air, a better place than a 
heated theatre. Those who were tired could leave, but pro- 
bably few left so rare an entertainment. Vulgar and coarse 
as much of it appears to us, it went straight home to the 
thoughts germinating in the breasts of the people. The satire 
is rude as a work of art, and not even the best actors could 
have made it a great drama. But it was like the masterpieces 
of the Greek theatre in one point, though so unlike them in 
its merits as poetry, — it was from the life, and it cut to the 
quick. It was a piece of history. It was an acted sermon. 
The pulpit was still all but dumb. Bishops and priests had 
ceased to preach, save on rare occasions. The voice of Knox 
had not yet been heard. Lyndsay, a layman, caught the ear 
both of the Court and people, and adapting the materials at 
his disposal — the masque with its allegory, the fool with his 
wise wit, the interlude with its moral characters — gave voice 
to the spirit of the new age. No truer lines were ever penned 
even by Scott than the familiar verses in which he describes 

" The flash of that satiric rage, 
Which, bursting on the early stage, 
Branded the vices of the age. 
And broke the keys of Rome." 

The satire had some, but only a momentary, effect on those it 
was intended to reform. " After the said interlude finished," 
writes Sir William Eure, an English envoy who received an

POLICY OF JAMES V. 59 

account from Mr Bellendean, a Scot " inclined to our sort " 
(a paraphrase for an English partisan), who saw it performed 
at Linlithgow, " the King did call upon the Bishop of Glas- 
gow, being chancellor, and diverse other bishops, exhorting 
them to reform their fashions and manners of living, saying 
that, unless they so did, he would send some of the proudest 
of them unto his uncle of England, and as those were ordered, 
so he would order all the rest who would not amend. And 
thereunto the chancellor should answer and say unto the King 
that one word of his Grace's mouth should suffice them to be 
at commandment And the King hastily and angrily answered 
that he would gladly bestow any words of his mouth that could 
amend them." 

But though willing to reform the Church, James was less 
willing to reform himself. His two French marriages were 
more powerful ties than his descent from an English mother. 
The politic and adroit Beaton conciliated him by a large grant 
from the overgrown revenues of the Church, the Pope legiti- 
mated his bastards, and the Stuart race irrevocably linked its 
fate with the fate of Rome. It was their natural tendency, 
which it would have required stronger and clearer heads than 
theirs to alter. It had been the astute and constant policy of 
successive popes to favour the smaller kings of Europe in pre- 
ference to the emperors and greater monarchs who might be 
their rivals. The Scottish king was sedulously courted by 
embassies and gifts, the leading prelates were propitiated by 
honours and foreign benefices, and the people were compli- 
mented, as the Irish now are, by allusions to their constant 
devotion to the Holy See. One thing was required and given 
in return : heresy must be extinguished by fire and sword. The 
doctrines deemed heretical do not appear to have at first spread 
rapidly in Scotland. Yet each wave of reform, before the Re- 
formation reached its far-off shore, and each attempt to drive it

back, as vain as that of Canute, only increased the volume till 
the waters burst in an overwhelming flood. The movement of 
Wycliffe, perhaps in consequence of the visit of John of 
Gaunt, produced Scottish Lollards in Kyle and Lothian. 
Resby, an English priest, was burnt at Perth in 1407. James 
I. passed a statute against them in 1425, and Lawrence of 
Lindores acted as inquisitor of heresy. Paul Crawar, a Bohe- 
mian, a representative of the opinions of Huss, was burnt at 
St Andrews in 1433. The Lollards of Kyle again appear in 
1494, when they were prosecuted by Archbishop Blackadder. 
Patrick Hamilton, nephew of the Earl of Arran, and a cousin 
of the king, who had studied at Wittenberg, where he had 
learnt the doctrines of Luther, was burnt at St Andrews on 
the last of February 1528, having been condemned by Arch- 
bishop James Beaton. The saying that the " reek " of Patrick 
Hamilton infected all it touched, like the similar saying as to 
the ashes of Wycliffe, and the earlier proverb that the blood of 
martyrs is the seed of the Church, proved true in Scotland. 
In 1534, Straton and Gourlay, and in 1539, Foret, a canon 
of Inchcolm, with other priests and friars — five in all — were 
burnt on the Castlehill of Edinburgh; another friar and a 
youth of eighteen, of marvellous ingyne (skill) in Scottish 
poetry, Kennedy, were burnt at Glasgow. In 1540, Sir John 
Borthwick, Sheriff" of Linlithgow, son of Lord Borthwick w^ho 
fell at Flodden, was condemned by Beaton the Cardinal, and 
only saved his life by flight. In January 1544, four men and 
a woman were put to death for heresy at Perth, again at the 
instance of the Cardinal. The martyrdom of George Wishart, 
a representative of the English Reformation, who had studied 
at Cambridge and preached at Bristol before his return to 
Scotland, at St Andrews on 28th March 1546, was the occa- 
sion, if not the cause, of the tragedy of the Cardinal. Whether 
or not he was directly involved in the plot of Henry VIII. for

CARDINAL BEATON. 6 1 

the removal of Beaton, his political as well as ecclesiastical 
adversary, by any means, foul or fair, has been keenly debated. 
It seems now established that it was another Wishart ; but it is 
certain that political as well as religious forces at this moment 
influenced the Scottish, as they did the English, Reformation. 
If, as Buchanan relates, Wishart, just before he was strangled 
at the stake, which was erected close by the Bishop's castle, 
prophesied the Cardinal's death, it was a prophecy soon ful- 
filled, and already so probable that it might have been antici- 
pated even by one who had no direct participation in the 
plot. The Cardinal was hated for his arrogance and the 
aggrandisement of his family, as well as for his constant per- 
secution of those who favoured reform. He had recently 
married his illegitimate daughter to a son of the Earl of 
Crawford, and had returned home to fortify the castle against 
an expected attack. 

On 28th May 1546, Norman Leslie and his brother John, 
sons of the Earl of Rothes; William Kirkaldy, younger of 
Grange ; James Melvin of Carnbee ; and Peter Carmichael of 
Balmaddie, " a stout gentleman," Knox calls him, with a few 
others, at most sixteen persons, representing a band of thirty- 
five, mostly country gentlemen of Fife, but including several 
chaplains, and other members of the lower ranks of the clergy, 
met in the churchyard of the Cathedral of St Andrews. Early 
in the morning, the castle drawbridge having been let down 
to admit materials for the new buildings, Kirkaldy and six 
companions engaged the porter in conversation, while Norman 
Leslie, with so small a band as to escape notice, passed 
into the castle-yard. John Leslie followed with four others. 
The porter, at last alarmed, was thrown into the fosse before 
he could draw the bridge. The keys were taken from him, 
and Kirkaldy watched at the private postern or gate, while 
John Leslie went to the Cardinal's chamber. What followed

must be told in the language of Knox. A modem version 
might add a few details, but would lose the colour and the 
clearness of one of the best pictures ever drawn in words. It 
represents both the act and the spirit of the actors with a vivid 
and startling reality. The Cardinal, who had barred the door, 
asked, "*Who calls?' He answers, *My name is Leslie.' 
The Cardinal re-demands, *Is that Normand?' The other 
says, * Nay ; my name is John.' * I will have Normand,' says 
the Cardinal, * for he is my friend.' * Content yourself with 
such as are here, for other ye shall get nane.' ... At length 
he asked, * Will ye save my life ? ' The said John answered, 
* It may be that we will.' * Nay,' says the Cardinal, * swear to 
me by Goddis woundis, and I will open unto you.' Then 
answered the said John, * It that was said is unsaid,' and so 
cried, * Fire ! fire ! ' and so was brought ane chymlay full 
of burning coallis. Which perceaved, the Cardinal or his 
chalmer child opened the door, and the Cardinal sat down in 
a chair and cryed, * I am a preast ! I am a preast ! ye will not 
slay me.' The said John Leslie strook him first anes or twice, 
and so did the said Peter Carmichael of Balmaddie. But 
James Melvin, a man of nature most gentill, and most modest, 
perceaving thame boyth in cholore, withdrew thame, and said 
this worke and judgment of God, altho' it be secreit, aught to 
be done with greater gravitie, and, presenting to him the point 
of the sweard, said, * Repent thee of thy former wicked life, 
but especiallie of the schedding of the blood of that notable 
instrument of God, Maister George Wishart, which, allbeit the 
flame of fyre consume before men, yitt cryes it a vengence 
upon thee, and we from God are sent to revenge it. For heir 
before my God I protest that nether haterent [/&gt;., hatred] of 
thy person, the luif of thy riches, nor the fear of any truble 
thow could have done to me in particulare, moved, nor moves 
me to stryk thee ; but only becaus thow hast bein, and remanes

ane obstinat ennemye against Christ Jesus and His holy evan- 
gel!/ And so he stroke him twyse or thrise throwgh with a 
slog sweard; and so he fell, never word heard out of his 
mouth but * I am a preast ! I am a preast ! fy, fy ! all is 
gone.'" 

To some, such words as Melvin's and Knox's marginal 
note describing the cold-blooded murder as " The Godly Act 
and Words of James Melvin," appear the height of blasphemy 
and cruelty, while to others they may seem the expression of 
a man who was, and believed himself, the hand of a righteous 
God. They were, in fact, the act and words of a time when 
the feelings of men had become like those of soldiers in a 
battle at the moment when not merely life and victory, but 
a cause they hold dearer than life and victory, is at stake. 
Fortunately soldiers act at such moments without words. It 
is difficult to combine the parts of judge and executioner. 
The lines ascribed to Lyndsay, though not to be found in his 
works, express the opinion of the most impartial spectator 
then possible — 

"Although the loon was weill away, 
The deed was foully done." 

The echoes of that tempest continued to be heard in Scot- 
land for more than a century. Are its waves even now still ? 
Are we yet, after two more centuries have passed, sufficiently 
distant and calm to give Lyndsay's words a wider reference ? 
May we say, although it was right that a Church corrupt in 
doctrine, discipline, and morals should be reformed, yet there 
was much in the mode of the revolution we call the Reforma- 
tion which was not well done ? It was not only the super- 
stitious images but also the houses pious men had dedicated 
to God's service which were wrecked. That service was not 
merely changed to the vulgar tongue, but deprived of the aids 
which architecture, painting, and music lend to lift the human

64 CALVINISM OF REFORMATION. 

spirit to the contemplation of the Almighty. A great gulf was 
made as if by one of the convulsions of nature between the 
Church of St Serf and St Margaret, and the Church of Knox 
and Melville. Or must we acknowledge that the sterner 
verdict of our forefathers was nearer the truth, that in this 
way, and in no other, was reformation possible. 

There are mysteries in the course of history, as in the 
order of nature, which baffle the wit of men to interpret. 
The historian is bound to be a witness to the truth so far as 
he sees it He is not bound, though he is ever ready, to 
pronounce judgment. Perhaps we may most safely adopt the 
words of one who lived within sight of a time when deeds of 
violence, and murders by fire and sword, were not occasional 
but constant : — " It is better for us to admonish the negligent 
that crimes may not abound, than to blame the things that 
have been done." 

The world-famed tale of the Sibylline books received a 
new and altered application. For the Church which had 
rejected the reforms of the Lollards, the Hussites, and the 
Lutherans, there remained the narrower doctrine and stricter 
discipline of the Reformation of Calvin. 

The political Calvinism of Scotland was partly a conse- 
quence and partly a cause of the growth of the democratic 
spirit, and of the devotion of the Royal House to the Roman 
Church. The nobles were divided. Some followed the King, 
others became Lords of the Congregation. This division 
weakened their power, though it still continued great. The 
people, with rare local exceptions, none of which were in Fife, 
went over to the Reformed Church, whose ministers became 
their leaders.

The history of Fife before the Reformation closes with the 
martyrdom of Wishart and the murder of Beaton. The last 
trial for heresy was that of Walter Myln, the old priest of 
Lunan^ who was taken at Dysart in 1558 when "warming 
himself in a poor wife's house and teaching her the com- 
mandments of God." He was burnt at St Andrews in the 
end of April 1558. The burgesses, who had shut their 
shops to prevent the sale of materials for his execution, 
erected a pile of stones to his memory. In 1560 the 
Council of Blackfriars ordered Sir David Lyndsay's books 
to be burnt; and John Knox was burnt in effigy. Fire 
consumed no more heretics, but another century had to 
pass before witches ceased to be burnt. Its next and most 
interesting chapter includes the preaching of John Knox, the 
chief author of the Scottish Reformation, and the first acts

66 QUEEN MARY AND JOHN KNOX. 

in the tragedy of Mary Stuart, the heroine, though not yet 
the saint, of the Roman Church. Some of the most memor- 
able passages in the lives of Mary and of Knox occurred in 
Fife. No contrast could be greater than that of the two 
actors, who so often confront each other in portrait-galleries 
as in life. The stern, bearded, middle-aged man of the 
commons met the beautiful young woman, in whose veins 
the blood of the Stuarts mingled with the blood of the Tudors 
and the Guises. The one had been bred in the school of ad- 
versity, the galleys and exile, and came within danger of the 
stake. The other had been delicately nurtured in the most 
brilliant Court of Europe, whose crown for a brief space she 
added to her own. Yet it was the man who, after a success- 
ful life, died honoured by most of his countrymen. The 
woman passed through blood and battle, baffled at every turn, 
into a captivity which ended on the scaffold. But by one of 
the revenges of time, Mary has now a wider, though not a 
higher, fame than Knox. 

Differing in all other respects, in two points they were 
alike — the tenacity with which Mary with feminine supple- 
ness, Knox with masculine boldness, pursued the objects 
each held sacred, and the courage which knew neither scruple 
nor fear. From the Scottish historical drama, in which they 
played leading parts, it is necessary to select the chief inci- 
dents illustrating the " History of Fife." 

Knox first preached in public in the parish church of St 
Andrews. This church had been dedicated to the Trinity 
by Bishop De Bernham, and though more than once repaired 
almost rebuilt in 1798, it still occupies the same site in the 
centre of the town. It was a Sunday in the end of May or 
beginning of June 1547. He had come at Easter to the 
castle with his pupils, the sons of Douglas of Longniddrie 
and Cockbum of Ormiston. East Lothian was no longer

safe, and St Andrews, after its castle had passed from the 
dead hand of Beaton into the custody of the swords of the ' 
Reformers, was the refuge and rallying-point of the professors 
of the Reformed doctrine. Protected by these, Knox con- 
tinued, in the chief citadel of the Roman Catholic Church, 
and the chapel of the castle of the Cardinal, quietly to instruct 
his pupils in the Gospel of St John, from the place where 
he had left off at Longniddrie, and also catechised them 
publicly in the parish church. His talent for instructing an 
elder class and wider audience could not be hid. John 
Rough, a friar turned preacher, Henry Balnavis, a theolo- 
gical lawyer, and Sir David Lyndsay, the Lyon King and 
poet, gave him a call to preach in public. 

To fill his spirit with that of the prophet from whom he 
determined to take his text, Knox for many days after his 
call showed no mirth, and avoided company. Once in the 
pulpit, hesitation vanished. He spoke as no preacher in 
Scotland had spoken since the first missionaries of the Celtic 
Church denounced paganism and preached the Gospel. He 
took for his text part of the 24th and 25th verses of the 7th 
chapter of Daniel, " And ane other king shall rise after thame, 
and he shall be unlyik unto the first, and he shall subdew 
three kinges, and shall speak wordes against the Most Heigh, 
and shall consome the sanctes of the Most Heigh, and think 
that he may change tymes and lawes, and thei shal be gevin 
unto his handis, until a tyme, and tymes, and deviding of 
tymes." It was, and is, a favourite text for the preacher 
anxious to find in the figures of the Hebrew prophets poetical 
expression and divine sanction for his own convictions. But 
it has never been used by one more persuaded of its inter- 
pretation than Knox. His abridgment of the sermon in the 
* History of the Reformation ' may be condensed, though to 
the prejudice of its argument and its eloquence. His exhorta-

tion praised the love of God in foretelling the dangers the 
Church was to pass through. He then treated the Babylonish 
captivity of the Israelites, and passed by natural transition to 
the four empires, Assyria, Babylon, Greece, and Rome, from 
whose ruins sprang the Roman Church. All the marks of 
the fourth beast of DaniePs vision were manifest in that 
Church. He contrasted it with the true Kirk, which fol- 
lowed the voice of Christ, its pastor. The New Testament 
confirmed the prophecy of the Old. The Papacy was the 
Antichrist or Man of Sin spoken of by Paul in the Thes- 
salonians, and the Babylonish Woman foretold by John in 
the Revelation. Then turning from prophet and apostle to 
recent history, he deciphered, or as we should say dissected, 
the lives of popes and friars. He compared their doctrine 
and laws with those of God and Christ, and asserted the 
Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith in the blood of 
Christ, in opposition to the Roman doctrine of works, which 
included not only those prescribed by God's law, but others 
of man's invention, as " pilgrimages, pardons, and other sic 
baggage." The Pope showed the marks of the beast by his 
blasphemous claims to be vicar of Christ, " one that cannot 
err," the doctrine of infallibility ; " that may make right of 
wrong," the doctrine of casuistry; and "of nothing some- 
what," perhaps the doctrine of transubstantiation ; who 
" trafficked in the bodies and souls of men " by the sale 
of indulgences and masses. He ended by challenging any 
doctor present to dispute his interpretation of the sacred 
writers. He was ready to prove they meant what he had 
said. 

His audience had been a strange mixture. His friends 
from the Castle were there, and amongst them the daring 
men who had taken part in the murder of Beaton, the two 
Leslies, Kirkaldy of Grange, and Carmichael, as well as

DISPUTATION IN ST LEONARDS YARDS. 69 

Others who, like Rough and Lyndsay, sympathised, as Knox 
himself did, with the deed when done. But there was 
also present John Major, provost of St Salvator's, the most 
learned scholastic theologian in Scotland, but now old and 
timid, along with the other reverend heads of the university ; 
Wynram the sub-prior, vicar-general in the vacancy of the 
see, canons and friars of both colours, Franciscan and Dom- 
inican, the leading citizens, lairds from the county, women 
and children. The comments on this, as on other sermons, 
varied. Some said "he struck at the root, while other 
preachers only sned the branches ; " others " that he would 
be burned like Wishart," which Forsyth, the Laird of Nydie, 
hearing, remarked, "Better try other defences than fire and 
sword, for men now have other eyes." Besides those favour- 
able to the Reformed doctrine, and the priests and friars, 
most of whom were its determined opponents, the majority 
of his hearers were waverers, ready to be converted by the 
best argument or most persuasive speaker. 

The challenge of Knox could scarcely be neglected, and 
a disputation followed in the yards of St Leonards, at the 
instance of Hamilton, the archbishop - designate, between 
Knox and Wynram. Wynram, a half-hearted champion, 
afterwards a convert to the Reformed doctrine, left the 
defence after a little to Friar Arbuckle, whom Knox over- 
came with logic and ridicule, as a master of fence might 
a bungler with the foil. Another mode of argument was 
tried. The friars every Sunday occupied the pulpit, to keep 
Knox out. He evaded this stratagem by preaching on week- 
days, till he was silenced by the arrival of the French galleys, 
under Strozzi, the prior of Capua, who, in breach of the 
terms of capitulation, carried oflf the bold Reformer and his 
companions as captives. It mattered little. The pulpit, 
so long silent, had found a voice which had a longer range

than any artillery then or since invented. For three cen- 
turies, from Knox to Chalmers, it became the chief popular 
power in Scotland. 

Knox served in the galleys for nineteen months. During 
this time Knox's galley returned in June 1548 to the coast 
of Scotland. When it lay between Dundee and St Andrews, 
James Balfour, son of the laird of Montquhanie, then his 
fellow-prisoner, afterwards parson of Flisk and Lord Clerk 
Register, the draftsman of the bond for Damley's murder, 
asked Knox if they should ever be delivered. Knox answered 
"that God would deliver them from that bondage to His 
glory even in this life." And when Balfour further inquired 
if he knew the land, Knox replied, " I know it well, for I see 
the steeple of that place where God in public first opened 
my mouth to His glory ; and I am fully persuaded, how weak 
that ever I now appear, that I shall not depart this life till 
that my tongue shall glorify His godly name in the same 
place." Balfour afterwards denied that he had ever been in 
the galleys ; but Knox, who denounced him as a liar and 
a renegade, avers that Balfour had repeated this prophecy 
many years before the return of Knox to Scotland. 

In the same year the men of Fife, led by Lord James, 
the Commendator of St Andrews, Lords Lindsay and Rothes, 
and the lairds of Wemyss and Largo, watched the coast of 
Fife and prevented the landing of the English. 

Ten years passed, and Knox, more favoured than most 
prophets, took the fulfilment of his prophecy into his own 
hands. On Friday, the 2d June 1559, he preached at An- 
struther, on Saturday at Crail, when he announced his pur- 
pose to preach on Sunday at St Andrews. Archbishop 
Hamilton had collected there a force of two hundred spears. 
Mary of Guise, the Queen Regent, was at Falkland with her 
French troops. Lord James Stewart, the future Regent

KNOX AGAIN PREACHES AT ST ANDREWS. /I 

Murray, and the Earl of Argyll, the two young lords who 
led the Reformers, — for they had the liking of their country- 
men, even when most democratic, to be led by a lord, — had 
only a few retainers, and frightened by the threat of the 
Archbishop that if Knox preached he would be saluted with 
a dozen of culverins, "whereof the most part should light 
upon his nose," they counselled delay. But Knox, resolute 
always, declined to be stopped. He would preach, as he 
had foretold, in the town and church where God had called 
him to the dignity of a preacher. His life was in God's 
hands. He wished no defenders. He only craved an 
audience. As usual, the stronger will got its way. Knox 
mounted the pulpit, and the Archbishop fled to Falkland 
to obtain help from Mary. 

The text of the sermon which Knox preached was from 
the description of the buyers and sellers Christ drove from 
the temple : " And Jesus went into the temple of God, 
and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, 
and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the 
seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is 
written. My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but 
ye have made it a den of thieves" (Matt xxi. 12, 13). The 
account he gives of the sermon is pregnant. The sermon 
was probably brief when fighting was deemed near. The 
corruption of the Papacy, he said, was the same as that of 
the Jews. Its priests dishonoured the house of God, making 
it a house of merchandise. The act of Christ in overthrow- 
ing the tables and the seats pointed the duty of those to 
whom God had given power and zeal. Although the town 
had not before openly professed sympathy with the Reform- 
ers, the magistrates and the greater part of the commonalty 
now acted on his suggestion, and "removed all monuments 
of idolatry with expedition."

72 ENCOUNTER OF CUPAR MUIR. 

There was little time for delay. Lodgings had been as- 
signed to the Queen and her troops at Cupar, but on Monday 
night Lord James and Argyll, with one hundred horse and 
some foot from the coast, occupied the town. Before noon 
on Tuesday, their number had swelled to three thousand. 
From Lothian came Ormiston, Calder, Hatton, and other 
lairds whom Knox had confirmed by his teaching in the 
Reformed doctrine. Lord Ruthven came from Perth; the 
Earl of Rothes, as sheriff, brought the men of Fife, "an 
honest company." Dundee and St Andrews sent their quota ; 
Cupar its whole force. "It appeared," says Knox, "as if 
men had rained from the clouds." The Queen's forces, led 
by the Duke of Chastelereau and D'Osell the French com- 
mander, had advanced during the night, keeping the south 
side of the Eden. Halliburton, the Provost of Dundee, 
chose the ground for the Reformers upon the muir about a 
mile and a half to the west of Cupar, on the same side of 
the river, with sufficient room for retreat in case of attack. 
Ruthven with the horse rode on in front to prevent the 
enemy from' discovering their numbers, and protected the 
roads to Cupar and St Andrews. After several fruitless 
attempts to force an attack, and to discover the strength 
opposed to them, the mist which hung that day, as it often 
still hangs, over the Eden, cleared, and in the afternoon the 
scouts saw for the first time the men of Dundee and St 
Andrews drawn up in a separate array from the gentlemen 
of Fife, Angus, and Mearns. This discovery led to a medi- 
ation, for the Queen's forces had expected no resistance. 
Terms of truce were signed by Chastelereau and D'Osell 
at Garliebank, the western slope of the Owl or Tarvit Hill, 
on whose summit the Cupar cross now stands. It was 
agreed that the Queen's troops should retire to Falkland, 
and that no French or other soldiers, except the former

MARY OF GUISE AND KNOX. 73 

garrisons of Dysart, Kirkcaldy, and Kinghorn, should remain 
in Fife. There was to be a truce for eight days until further 
terms might be negotiated. 

Chastelereau and D'Osell returned to Falkland, where the 
Queen expressed her indignation that they had missed so 
good an occasion for fighting. The troops of the Reformed 
party dispersed, but the two lords and the great part of the 
gentry went to St Andrews, where it was agreed that they 
should meet at Perth on the 24th of June to relieve that town 
from its French garrison. The Queen having shown no sign 
of negotiating further, a letter was written to her complaining 
that the assurance was not kept that French soldiers, or what 
was the same thing, soldiers in French pay, were kept in 
Perth contrary to a promise given by the Duke at Stirling 
some time before, and that a provost had been enforced upon 
the citizens. Perth was relieved on Sunday, the 25th June; 
but we must not pass beyond the bounds of Fife. A desultory 
war of si^es, skirmishes, and sallies went on as elsewhere, or 
perhaps more than elsewhere, in Fife, which abounded in 
fortified houses of all sizes. In this partisan war Kirkaldy of 
Grange, another of Knox*s companions in the galleys, who 
had since served an apprenticeship in the wars in Picardy, 
greatly distinguished himself by making reprisals on the 
French, who destroyed his castle of Halyards, and spoiled his 
lands of Grange on the coast For a time the French troops 
had the best of it, and Mary of Guise exultingly said, " Where 
is now John Knox his God ? My God is stronger than his, 
even in Fife." It had come to this, that those who acknow- 
ledged the same Son and Saviour believed in different Gods. 
But the prophecy proved false. The French were soon after 
driven from Fife, and the contest centred in the siege of Leith, 
still held by a French garrison, as was also the Castle of 
.Edinburgh, in which Mary of Guise had been forced to

74 QUEEN MARY IN FIFE. 

take refuge. She saw the corpses of enemies stretched out 
on the ground, and delighted in it as "a bonny sight." 
By the Reformers the mother of Mary Stuart was naturally 
deemed another Jezebel. Her death in the Castle of Edin- 
burgh, and the reduction of Leith with the aid of the English, 
led to the peace of Edinburgh and the Establishment of the 
Protestant religion by the Parliament of 1560. 

The death of Francis II. before the close of the same year 
brought a new actor on the field, whose connection with Fife 
has given it a world-wide interest. It is only a small portion 
of mankind who give heed to the preacher. Every heart is 
touched by the charm and fate of Mary Stuart, and few minds 
resist the attempt to read the riddle of her life. In August 
1 561 she returned to Scotland, sad at quitting France with its 
bright sky, not sorry to leave Catherine de Medici, a mother- 
in-law with the feelings popularly attributed to a step-mother, 
and glad to exchange the position of a young dowager for that 
of a regnant queen. She knew the outward contrast between 
the polished courtiers and as yet submissive third estate of 
France, and the rough barons and rude commons of her own 
country. But she was not fully conscious of the inward and 
deep difference, political as well as religious, between the 
people she then left and those whom she was now to try to 
govern. 

During the six years of her actual reign she was much 
in Fife, visiting Falkland, Lochleven, Cupar, Wemyss, and 
St Andrews, hunting and hawking, dancing and singing, 
escaping the restraint of Court at Holyrood and the mob of 
the Edinburgh streets, to play the bourgeois wife in the 
merchant's house still standing at the corner of South Street 
in St Andrews, or the country girl in the park and woods of 
Falkland. Our attention must be fixed on three places, each 
the scene of incidents notable even amongst the many

romantic scenes of her life. At Burntisland, then called 
Wester Kinghom, Chastellard committed the fault or crime 
for which he paid the forfeit of his life. At Wemyss she met 
Damley. In the Castle of Lochleven she found her first 
prison, and commenced, if guilty, her lifelong expiation ; if 
innocent, her slow torture for his death. 

When the Queen, only in her nineteenth year, returned to 
Scotland, amongst her brilliant suite was a young cavalier and 
poet, Chastellard, a gentleman in the service of M. d'Amville, 
the son of Anne de Montmorency, afterwards Constable of 
France. He came of good family in Dauphin^, and was 
grandnephew by his mother of Bayard, the chevalier sans peur 
et sans reproche^ whom he resembled in the former quality. 
It was said he was also like Bayard in his good figure, his 
skill in arms, games, and dancing. He spoke and wrote both 
prose and verse in a pleasing style ; but if the few specimens 
of his poetry preserved are fair samples, he was an indif- 
ferent poet. This accomplished gentleman, says his friend 
Brantome, made the Queen's acquaintance by his good quali- 
ties, and especially by his rhymes. In a sonnet translated 
from the Italian he put the dangerous question, " Of what use 
is it to possess kingdoms, cities, towns, provinces, and to com- 
mand nations, to be respected, feared, and admired by every 
one, yet to live a lonely widow, cold as ice ? " In another he 
paid a trite, perhaps still more hazardous, compliment to her 
beauty, " That her eyes lit the sea, and made torches needless 
for a lover." The Queen returned compliment for compli- 
ment and verse for verse. Like many royal ladies of the 
time, and some of her own ancestors, she practised poetry, 
an unsafe guide for life. Chastellard returned to France with 
M. d'Amville ; but, unwilling to take part in the religious wars 
of France, and longing again to see the lady of his heart, like 
a moth unable to shun the flame, he came to Scotland in 1562

with a letter from M. d'Amville recommending him to the 
Queen. He was received in the beginning of November at 
Montrose, where Randolph, the English envoy, saw him de- 
liver his letter, watching the Queen with spy's eyes as she read. 
He detected only smiles, in which Lethington, the astute 
secretary, assured him there were no politics. It was probably 
no more than a letter of recommendation and a smile of recog- 
nition. But Mary imprudently treated the young cavalier 
with more than her common graciousness, accepted a copy 
of his poems, and mounted him on a horse, the gift of Lord 
Robert Stuart. Knox insinuates further familiarities, that she 
chose him, and it is likely enough she did, for her partner in 
a dance called " The Purpose," leaned on his shoulder, and 
preferred his company to that of the nobles, which is a charge 
he repeats almost in the same words with regard to Rizzio. 
Her condescension turned a giddy brain. Brantome, in the 
light manner of his time and country which we can scarcely 
understand, boasts of the amour which cost his friend his life. 
Yet it must be remembered he knew Mary Stuart as well as 
Chastellard. " In old times," he says, " mortals loved god- 
desses and knights princesses. Men will continue to love those 
above them." Chastellard's conduct was an extravagance, not 
a crime. He was a Phaethon or a Pygmalion. Mary was the 
Sun that burnt, not a Galatea who rewarded her lover. This 
was the era in France of Ronsard and the Pleiad. The classic 
and heathen had mingled with and corrupted the medieval and 
religious idea of chivalric love. Royal ladies specially favoured 
poets, from the day when a daughter of James I. of Scotland, 
the wife of the Dauphin, afterwards Louis XL, kissed the lips 
of Alan Chartier, from which so many virtuous thoughts and 
wise sayings had come, to that on which Margaret of Savoy 
won the favour of Henry of Navarre for Ronsard by reading 
his verses with her royal lips. Mary Stuart's smiles were fatal

HIS EXECUTION AT ST ANDREWS. JJ 

gifts. On the night of 12th February 1563, Chastellard hid 
himself in the Queen's room at Holyrood. Pardoned, whether 
by or against the wish of the Queen is not certain, he followed 
her in a few days to Burntisland, and was again found in a 
room still called the state bed-chamber, in the Castle of Ross- 
end, on the rock forming the west side of the harbour of 
Burntisland, where Mary rested on her way to St Andrews. 
It was impossible to overlook a second offence. He was tried 
by an assize, of which the record along with that of others of 
this period is unfortunately lost, and executed at St Andrews 
on the 2 2d of February. According to Knox, he confessed 
his guilt. Randolph makes a similar statement in a letter to 
Cecil ; but Brantome, with more probability, says that he re- 
fused the aid of minister or confessor, and died after reading 
on the scaffold a hymn to death by his master Ronsard. His 
last words were the passionate cry, an echo of " La belle Dame 
sans merci," " Adieu ! most beautiful and most cruel princess 
of the world." " Such," remarks Knox, " was the reward of 
his dancing," which was in the eyes of the Reformer, as of 
some of his countrymen, almost a sin. Brantome, on the 
other hand, though he does not himself accept, reports the 
view of the Frenchmen of his class, that all the misfortunes of 
Mary were due to the one crime of Chastellard*s death. Mary 
herself was at St Andrews on the day of the execution ; and 
though she must have felt the scandal, within a week, accord- 
ing to Randolph's report, she was merry again, till the news of 
the murder of her uncle, the Duke of Guise, again saddened 
her young volatile spirits. But the fate of Chastellard, he 
adds, is a scar that will never be effaced. 

The story of Chastellard is not a mere episode in the life 
of Mary. It was one of the causes which led to the marriage 
with Damley. It convinced her, probably not unwilling to 
be convinced, that a young widowed queen could not live in

78 DARNLEY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH. 

Scotland without risk of scandal or even of outrage, and that 
marriage was a personal as well as a political necessity. Every 
Court in Europe had wooers for the hand which held the 
dowry of France and the crown of Scotland in fee, with the 
crown of England in reversion. Queen Elizabeth had an- 
nounced her intention not to marry. With an inscrutable 
insincerity or inconsistency, which baffles all historians to 
interpret, except Mr Froude, who applies his theory of self 
sacrifice to her as to Henry VIII., Elizabeth pressed Dudley, 
whom she loved herself, as the most suitable husband for her 
dear sister and cousin. Yet at the last moment the young 
Darnley, whom she thought the least desirable match, and 
who was known to aspire to his cousin's hand, was allowed 
to follow his father Lennox to Scotland. Did she wish to try 
or tempt both the man she loved and the woman she hated ? 
Dudley, preferring the chance of the greater kingdom, professed 
himself unworthy of Mary, and did not take a single step to 
urge his suit. Darnley, with all his faults, possessed to perfec- 
tion the qualities of an ardent lover. He was only nineteen, a 
little younger than Mar&gt;'. The grandson of Margaret Tudor, 
he had the privilege of cousinhood, and he was on his father's 
side a Stuart, with some drops of the mysterious royal blood, 
which counted for so much in the theory of equality in mar- 
riage. He could write a good letter, and verses at least as 
good as Chastellard's. He was tall, well made, with a fair, 
smooth face, so much talked of, that when Sir James Melville 
came to Elizabeth's Court, and she started the subject of the 
marriage with Dudley without getting any favourable reply 
from the old diplomatist and match-maker, she said to him, 
" You like better of that long lad," pointing to Darnley, who 
carried the sword of honour as nearest prince of the blood. 
His mother, proud of her boy, had perhaps sent him to visit 
Mary in her widowhood in France, and certainly now prepared

the way for a youth no longer a boy with a woman's tact, by 
gifts of jewels to the Queen and her principal advisers. " She 
was," says Melville, with whom she had a secret understanding, 
and who was the bearer of her gifts, " a very discreet matron." 
"Cousinage," says the French proverb, "dangereuse voisin- 
age." While other suitors wrote letters, talked about terms, 
and sent envoys, Darnley came, was seen, and conquered. 
He reached Berwick on the 12th of February 1565, and 
after staying a night with Maitland at Lethington, and two 
days in Edinburgh, crossed the Firth and found her at the 
Castle of Wemyss on the i6th. 

This castle stands on one of the picturesque sites in Fife, 
a cliff some forty feet above the sea, about the centre of the 
finely curved bay between Kinghorn and the point of Elie. 
Its tower has a clear view across the Forth to the well-marked 
outline of the ridge on which Edinburgh then stretched its 
single line of buildings from Holyrood at the foot of Arthur 
Seat to the Casdehill, with the Braids and Pentlands in the 
background. Inchkeith, the May, the Bass, and the Law of 
North Berwick, give variety to the outlines of the landscape. 
On the east at a little distance are the fragments of the wall 
of one of Macduffs castles, and on the shore below, the sea 
has made the caves which gave Wemyss its name, inscribed 
with rude figures of mysterious Pagan symbols and the Chris- 
tian cross of the early missionaries carved by unknown hands 
before history was written. The castle, encrusted with mod- 
em building, still contains the room magniloquently called a 
presence-chamber, now the housekeeper's parlour, in which 
Mary received Darnley. It was situated in the quadrangular 
court, then the centre of the building. It belonged, as it 
still does, to a family which claims descent from Macduff, the 
Celtic chief, perhaps King of Fife, one of whose ancestors 
had been sent with Sir Michael Scot of Balwearie to bring

80 MARY MARRIES DARNLEY. 

home the Maid of Norway. But at this date it was in the 
possession of Lord James, the Queen's brother, with what 
object is not explained. It is said that Darnley, on being 
shown Murray's estates on a map of Scotland, imprudently 
growled, " He has too much land." No Scotch lord or laird 
before or since knew better the art of " birsing yont " than 
Murray. The season was inclement, and neither landscape, 
history, nor politics probably were thought of by a pair of 
lovers during the sweet swift hours of the dawn of love. 

In January the French Ambassador De Foix wrote to 
Catherine de Medici that the Queen had begun to marry 
her Marys, and said she would be of the band and marry 
within six months. She was leading a merry life, hunting in 
the morning and dancing in the evening, with Lennox as her 
most frequent partner. The news had come that Darnley 
had at last got leave from Queen Elizabeth, and was about to 
start for Scotland. Mary knew as well as Elizabeth what 
Darnley's errand was. She received him graciously, though 
she coyly declined a ring too soon offered. But she had, for 
the first and last time in her life, fallen in love. Unless Both- 
well is an exception, all her later matrimonial projects were 
directed by the head, not by the heart. It was her lot to be 
loved rather than to love. "Her Majestie," writes the 
courtier Melville, "tuk weill with Darnley, and said that he 
was the best-proportioned lang lad that she had seen, for he 
was of a heich stature, lang and small, even and brent up, 
weill instructed from his youth in all honest and comely exer- 
cises." The longer he was with her the better she liked him. 
Before he left Wemyss on the 19th of February, she had 
determined, though not consented, to marry. The public 
marriage at Holyrood did not take place till the end of July, 
but a private marriage or betrothal was celebrated, in a room 
fitted up by Rizzio as a chapel at Stirling, in April. "She

does everything to please him," wrote Randolph to Cecil 
shortly before the marriage (3d July 1566), "though he can- 
not be persuaded to yield the smallest thing to please her." 
But after a few months (13th Feb. 1567), "I know now for 
certain that the Queen repenteth her marriage, that she hateth 
him and all his kin." The hasty marriage had led to a quick 
repentance. It takes little time to dissolve the marriage of the 
eye. Before her son was bom, Rizzio, the Italian adventurer, 
whose voice first gained her ear, and whose skill in languages 
had given him possession of her secrets, — cause enough for 
jealousy without the invention of a guilty attachment, — was 
murdered in her presence with Darnley's connivance, for 
which she never forgave him. His own murder by Bothwell 
followed within less than a year that of Rizzio. Her marriage 
to Bothwell was a little more than three months after Damley's 
death, and her surrender and BothwelFs flight at Carberry 
were within two months from their fatal marriage. 

A prisoner in the hands of the nobles of the Protestant 
party, Mary was sent to Lochleven on 17th June 1567, and 
remained there till her escape on the 2d of May in the follow- 
ing year. The castle on the island was the scene of her last 
and longest residence in Fife. It was not unknown to her, 
for she had more than once stopped there in riding to or from 
Perth. She had built on .the west of its courtyard a new pre- 
sence-chamber, and hung on its walls tapestry with scenes of 
hunting and hawking, her favourite sport. The choice of this 
castle for her imprisonment was perhaps due to the fact that 
Lady Douglas, the mother of its young owner. Sir James 
Douglas, was the mother also by James V. of Lord James, the 
Queen's illegitimate brother and future Regent. But it was 
used before as well as after as a State prison. It even 
became a sajring that "those never got luck who came to 
Lochleven." Her fate and that of the Earl of Northumber-

land probably assisted in the making of this proverb. The 
curse is past. One who goes to Lochleven now, even if he 
has not luck in angling, finds a picturesque scene, and returns 
with his imagination full both of its past and present. It 
has not the wild beauty of Highland lochs, nor the rich 
foliage of English and Irish lakes, but when the sun shines 
on its broad sheet of water, or the moon rises over the 
Bishop's Hill, its quiet landscape has a peculiar charm. 

In historical memories Lochleven has no rival among 
Scottish lochs. One of its islands was the cradle of Chris- 
tianity in Fife, and the Priory of Portmoak had a cell there 
dedicated to St Serf. In this cell, or the home of the prior, 
Andrew of Wintoun probably wrote his *Oryginal Chronicle 
of Scotland,' and Kinross-shire may be deemed the birth- 
place, of Scottish History. The castle in which Mary was 
confined, which gives its name to the Castle Island, may 
have been built in the thirteenth century. It had been 
associated with a daring exploit of Wallace, who delivered 
it from the English. It stood a siege by Baliol, and later 
received as prisoners of state King Robert II., his lawless son 
the Wolf of Badenoch, and a Primate of Scotland, Patrick 
Graham, whose Royal blood and high office did not save him, 
in the reign of James III., from a captive's grave on St 
Serf's Island, where a skeleton, probably his, was not long 
ago disinterred. 

Queen Mary herself had met Knox there on 13th April 
1565, and a second time at Turfhills, in the immediate 
neighbourhood, in the least stormy of their interviews, when 
she was all smiles, and, according to tradition, gave a watch 
to the Reformer, whose good offices she sought to make up 
a quarrel between the Earl of Argyll and his wife. But 
Knox's stern verdict, then formed and never altered, was 
that her heart was closed, if any heart had ever been, against

MARY'S LIFE AT LOCHLEVEN. 83 

God and His truth. Within three miles of the loch, at Barn- 
hill, she and Darnley narrowly escaped capture when on the 
road to Edinburgh for their public marriage, outrunning the 
ambush concerted by Murray, Argyll, and other nobles, by 
one of the early and rapid rides in which she delighted. 
Every feature of the loch and its surroundings, the braes 
of the Ochils on the north, the Bishop's Hill on the east, 
Benarty on the south, the flat carse with Kinross, the head 
of the peninsula of Fife, on the west, and the neighbouring 
towers of Burleigh, Dowhill, Cleish, Aldie, and Tullibole, the 
monastery of Portmoak, and the hospital at Scotlandwell, 
must have been familiar to the Queen. Nature wears a 
different garb when seen from a prison; and though her 
hands were busy with the needle and the spindle, or if she 
got sufficient ink from coal with the pen, the one thought of 
the captive was how to escape. 

The life of Mary at Lochleven has been minutely described 
in the memorial of Nau, her secretary, in *The Abbot' of 
Scott, a romance which is not fiction, and in a careful 
memoir by Mr Burns Begg. Antiquaries, more fortunate 
than usual in all which concerns Queen Mary, have preserved 
the screen she and her maids worked with the scenes appar- 
ently of her own history, the sceptre she cast into the loch in 
her flight, the keys young Willie Douglas stole to enable her 
to escape, and possibly the cannon-ball Sir William Douglas 
shot at his brother George when hovering round the loch to 
communicate with her and aid her flight. Tradition marks 
the spot near the east of the grounds of the new house of 
Kinross where she stepped on shore, and gives a quaint turn 
to the praise of her fair skin that the red wine shone through 
her transparent neck. No passages of Scottish history are 
better known than those which record her extorted signature 
to the Deed of Abdication ; Lindsay's savage answer to her

tears, "Better women weep than bearded men"; her inter- 
views with Murray, when a Stuart met a Stuart ; and the visit 
of Sir Robert Melville, from the scabbard of whose sword 
dropt the letter by which Lethington gave her the clue of a 
mouse gnawing the net which confined a lion. The mouse 
took the hint, and did a good deal of gnawing with her fine 
teeth. 

She had recently recovered from a miscarriage, but at no 
period of her stirring life was her brain more busy, her body 
more alert Her escape, first projected by a forcible seizure 
of the transport boat and an assault on the castle, was de- 
feated by the vigilance of James Drysdale, captain of the 
guard. It was a second time attempted in the disguise of a 
laundress, and was finally effected by the ingenious series of 
ruses and mystifications by which Mary herself got Drysdale 
out of the way and young Willie Douglas hoodwinked the 
keeper of the castle, possibly his own father, with a boy's 
pleasure in a game, which grown people seldom have when 
the game is earnest. She spoke so openly of her deter- 
mination to escape, that Douglas and his mother thought 
either she would not try or would certainly fail. She wrote 
letters to Catherine de Medici and to Queen Elizabeth, skil- 
fully conceived in terms which, if they were intercepted, would 
make her keepers believe she thought escape impossible unless 
by foreign aid. She played pranks with Willie Douglas and 
her attendants, even rehearsing her escape, making experi- 
ments how the garden-wall should be leapt, and in the mock 
play of the " Abbot of Unreason," in which Willie acted the 
boy abbot, followed him in a romping race about the ground 
till every one laughed as if he were drunk or simple. But 
his simplicity enabled him to jam with pegs the chains of the 
boats, except of one in which Mary was to escape, and to lift 
the key with a napkin from the table where it lay by the side

KNOX'S LAST VISIT TO ST ANDREWS. 85 

of Sir William when at supper. Mary, after she had supped, 
went to the room above her own tower, usually occupied by 
her surgeon, she said to pray. Who will doubt that she 
prayed for deliverance ? But she found time also to put on 
a hood and cape as a disguise, and to provide herself with a 
kerchief as a signal. As soon as Willie Douglas gave the 
sign that the key was stolen, she ran down the stairs, along 
the lobby, past the door of the room where Sir William still 
lingered over his wine, through the unlocked gate, relocked 
outside as soon as she passed into the unchained boat, over 
the short mile to the nearest shore. Lord Seton, with a troop 
of horse who lay concealed in a hollow of the Hill of Ben- 
arty, the rim of which gave an outlook on the Castle Island, 
galloped round to meet her. As arranged, she waved the 
kerchief. It was of a colour well chosen, red bordered with 
black, and on landing she was at once met by Seton and 
his men. Greeted with looks and words of sympathy from 
the villagers as she passed through Kinross, she rode without 
halt to Queensferry, where she passed the Forth to Niddrie, 
Seton's house, in the parish of Kirkliston, where she slept 
after her swift ride. Mary never again set foot in Fife or 
Kinross; but she never forgot, any more than history can 
forget, the weary months spent in her first prison. Years 
after, she dictated an account of her captivity and escape 
to Nau, to beguile the still wearier months of Fotheringay, 
when hope had become despair. 

John Knox visited St Andrews for the third and last time 
the year before his death, residing there from the beginning 
of July 1 57 1 to 17th August 1572. Although the cause of 
which he had been the champion had in the main triumphed, 
the religious war was not yet over. The events of the last 
few years had clouded the triumph of the Reformers. These 
might have made one less convinced that God governed the

world, and would guide Scotland in the way Knox believed 
alone right, dread the future. The Regent Murray, his chief 
political supporter, had been murdered ; Lennox had met the 
same fate ; Mar, who succeeded to the regency, and Morton, 
who looked forward to it, and already possessed the chief 
influence in political affairs, were Reformers of too moderate 
a type for Knox. The Castle of Edinburgh was held for the 
Queen by Kirkaldy of Grange, and Maitland of Lethington 
had transferred his versatile talents once more to her side. 
The loss of the most gallant sword and the coolest head in 
Scotland was deeply felt by Knox. Maitland he had always 
distrusted, and he now declared, in terrible words to be used 
by one of another mortal, that he could not answer for his 
fate in this world or the next. The loss of Grange was the 
loss of a friend, the greatest blow which can fall on an old 
man. Knox himself had just recovered from a stroke of 
apoplexy, which for a time tied his tongue, to the joy of his 
adversaries, and when he recovered speech left him physically 
weak, and keenly conscious of his own weakness. But the 
indomitable spirit knew no decay. 

His lodging, in the new buildings near the abbey at St 
Andrews, was the centre of the life of the Protestant cause. 
With the eye of a general he surveyed the field, and directed 
his chief attack at the strongest point of the enemy's position 
without neglecting minor skirmishes where an advantage could 
be gained. The Castle of Edinburgh, personified by his 
vivid imagination, was the subject of the most vehement 
denunciations, both from the pulpit and in letters to his 
friends. " That Babylon, the Castle of Edinburgh," he wrote 
to the Laird of Drumlanrig, " sail ones bring Scotland in that 
miserie that we and our posteritie sail murne for a tyme. Bot 
yit, schir, be nocht ye nor the faythful afraid, for to destruc- 
tione sail it come, and they that presently suiTeris sail rejoice

in this life and etemallie." He signs, ** Yours lying in Sanct 
Androis half deid, the 26 of May 1572 "; and he calls out as 
if his pen spoke, " Dead Scotland waiken, who before wald 
nocht be admonished of trubles to cum. Bot now in middis 
of trubles it seikis a wronge remede ; for it is neather Eng- 
land, France, nor Spain in whom God has placed any comfort 
to pure Scotland, but onlie it rests in Himself, and onlie of 
Him must we receave it." 

In spite of weakness he preached every Sunday, again 
choosing Daniel for his texts, from the ist to the middle of 
the 9th chapter. "He always applied his text," says his 
secretary Bannatyne, " to the time and state of the people : 
whereby the wicked and troublers of God's Kirk might be 
pointed out in their colours." How different were the cold 
sermons of Mr Robert Hamilton, the minister of the town, 
who spoke only generalities which might be applied to those 
that sustained the good cause, as well as to the troublers of 
the Kirk, and suppressed the doings of such troublers, content 
if he had an approved author for anything he said ! In St 
Andrews Knox was far from having all his own way. He was 
opposed not only by Hamilton, but also by John Rutherford, 
the provost of St Salvator ; by two other Hamiltons, Archi- 
bald and Robert ; even by Mr Homer Blair, a young student 
of St Salvator's, who inveighed against him and the students 
of St Leonard's in a public oration. The hottest words were 
used. Mr Archibald Hamilton would not attend Knox's 
sermons, which was not wonderful, as one of Knox's particular 
applications had been that all Hamiltons were murderers. 
Hamilton retaliated, "Mr Knox was as great a murderer as 
any Hamilton in Scotland if all things were well tried, and 
therefore should not cry out so fast against murderers, for he 
had subscribed the slaughter of the Queen's husband along 
with Murray." Knox, to whom this charge was reported,

88 KNOX PROTESTS AGAINST UNIVERSITIES. 

challenged Hamilton, in a letter sent by Richard Bannatyne, 
his secretary, to say whether he had affirmed that he had seen 
Knox's subscription. Hamilton returned a shifting answer, 
with the sneer at the too zealous and over-credulous Banna- 
tyne, that if the smallest boy had been sent instead of Banna- 
tyne, Hamilton would have come to Knox and satisfied him. 
A further attempt to prove that the libellous charge had been 
made by confronting Robert with James Hamilton, to whom 
he was said to have made the charge, ended, as libellous 
charges often do, in the smoke of controversy. James Ham- 
ilton, taunted by his kinsmen and fellow-students as " Knox's 
bird," was forced to leave St Salvator's. Minor, even trinal 
causes of dispute, clouded the chief issue. There was jealousy 
between the two colleges, and the old feud in a new form 
between the university authorities and the ministers. Scandal 
did what it could to blacken. Knox, it was said, preached 
against making Mr John Douglas a bishop, the first of 
Morton's tulchan bishops, because he did not get the bish- 
opric himself; to which Knox replied in his next sermon, 
" that he had refused a greater bishopric which he might have 
had with the favour of greater men." The real contest was not 
for titles, but for power. The man who swayed the Scottish 
Presbyterian Church as absolutely as any Pope that of Rome, 
had little need of the name of bishop. One of his protests 
was characteristic of his determination that there should be no 
rival of his pulpit throne. " I protest," he said, " that neather 
the pulpit of Saint Androis, neather yit of ony congregatione 
within the realm, be subject to the censure of the schooles, 
universities, or faculties within the same, but only that it 
be reserved to God, the judge of all, and to the General 
Assemblie gatherit within the same realm lauchfullie. The 
reason of this my protestation is, that I luike for no better

THE RELIGIOUS DEMOCRACY. 89 

before us, in the quhilk it is evident that universities, orderis 
weal established, and men raised up to defend the Kirk of 
God have oppressed it, and the malice of Satan is always 
to be fearit." This is the utterance of the Scottish religious 
democracy, and of a leader satisfied that when he spoke it was 
the voice of God, when his opponents acted it was the malice 
of Satan. 

But if one who used such language, and never concealed 
his opinion, had, as was natural, bitter enemies, both open 
and concealed, and betrayed the weaknesses which beset 
popular leaders of the Church as well as the State, Knox 
had also during his stay in St Andrews warm friends, and 
showed a nobler side of his character. Bannatyne, whose 
tedious and dry memorials are sincere even to the point of 
exhibiting his own and his master's failings, served him with a 
devotion like that of a Highland foster-brother to his foster- 
chief. The faithful in Edinburgh and throughout the country 
waited on his least words. The heads of St Leonard's came 
in to his grace after dinner to enjoy his conversation. The 
leading ministers crossed the ferries of the Forth and Tay to 
visit him. Lekprevick removed his press from Edinburgh to 
St Andrews when Mr Knox came there. David Ferguson, 
the minister of Dunfermline, sent to John Knox and his 
brethren his answer to Renard Benedict, a Roman contro- 
versialist, which Knox acknowledged, "with my dead hand 
but glad heart, praising God that of His mercy He leaves such 
light to the Kirk in its desolation." The students of St 
Leonard's were as strongly attached as those of St Salvator's 
were opposed to him. 

A singular good fortune brought to this college in the very 
year of Knox's residence a lad of fifteen from Montrose, who 
had the qualities common in the best students — an eager 
desire for knowledge, a modest estimate of himself, a respect

for his parents and teachers, an inquiring mind, observant 
eyes, and a diligent pen. The Diary of James Melville 
contains the most lifelike picture of Knox ever drawn, for the 
painter has failed to catch in any portrait the mingled stern- 
ness and tenderness which could charm as well as terrify. It 
would be wrong to alter a word. "Bot because in all my 
course," he says, " the graittest benefit was the sight and heir- 
ing of that extraordinar man of God, Mr Jhone Knox, sa far 
as I then knew and herd of him, I man heir record. In the 
tyme of his being in St Androis ther was a General Assemblie 
hauldin in the scholles of St Leonard's, our Collage. Thair 
amangs uther things was motioned the making of Bischopes ; 
to the quhilk Mr Knox opponit him selff directlie and 
zealuslie. . . . The Erie of Mortoun gat the Bischoprik of 
St Androis, efter the hanging of Jhone Hamiltone, and pre- 
sented therunto that honorable father of the Universitie, as 
Rector thairof for the present, Mr Jhone Dowglass, a guid, 
upright-harted man, bot ambitius and simple, nocht knawing

* Alas ! for pitie to lay upone an auld weak man's back that 
quhilk twentie of the best gifts could nocht bear. It will wrak 
him and disgrace him ! ' " After mentioning Knox's bodily 
weakness, he describes his preaching. "I saw him everie 
day of his doctrine [preaching] go hulie [slowly] and fear 
[fairly] with a furring of martiks [martin-skins, which, by an 
Act of James I., only knights and lords of 200 merks at the

lyk to ding that pulpit in blads and fly out of it. . . . There 
was twa in Saint Androis wha wer his aydant [diligent] heirars 
and wrot his sermonts, an my condisciple, Mr Andro Yowng, 
now minister of Dumblean, wha transleated some of tham in 
Latin, and read tham in the hall of the Collage in stead 
of his orations. That uther was servant to Mr Robert 
Hamilton, minister of the town, whom Mr Robert causit 
to wrait, for what end God knawes. The threatnings of 
his sermonts war verie soar; and sa particular, that sic as 
lyket nocht the cause tuk occasion to reprotche him as a 
rashe railer, without warrand. And Mr Robert Hamilton 
himselff being offendit, conferrit with Mr Knox, asking his 
warrand of that particular thretning against the Castel of 
Edinbruche, that it sould rin lyk a sand-glass ; it sould spew 
out the Captain with schame; he sould nocht com out at 
the yet, bot doun ower the walles ; and sick lyk. Mr Knox 
answerit, *God is my warrant and yie sail sie it.* Whill 
as the uther was skarslie satisfeit, and tuk hardlie with it, 
the nixt sermont from pulpit he repeates the threatnings, 
and addes therto, * Thow that will nocht beleive my warrand, 
sail sie it with thy eis that day, and sail say, what haif I 
to do heir?'" 

These prophecies and prognostics which we should now 
deem not so wonderfully particular, were fulfilled to the letter 
when the castle was taken by storm, and Kirkaldy of Grange, 
its captain, made prisoner. Like many other of Knox's 
utterances, they proved his power of foresight, if not of 
prophecy, as his followers long believed. Melville also took 
notes of Knox's sermons on Daniel. "I had my pen and 
my little buik," he says, " and tuk away sic things as I could 
comprehend. In the opening up of his text he was moderate 
for the space of an half hour ; but when entered into applica-

tion, he made me so to grew and tremble that I could not 
hold a pen to wrait." 

But Knox had gentler moments, and would sometimes 
" come in and repose him in our college yeard, and call us 
schollars unto him, and blis us and exhort us to know God 
and His wark in our countrie, and stand by the guid cause, 
to use our time weel, and learn the guid instructions and 
follow the guid example of our maisters." He even took 
part in the amusements of the place, and was present at a 
play acted at the marriage of Mr Colvin. He may have 
been tempted to what some of his successors would have 
regarded as a sin, by the subject of the play, which was the 
siege and taking of the Castle of Edinburgh and the Captain 
"according to Mr Knox's doctrine." At last, as so many 
years before, there came a call, in which he recognised the 
voice of God, that he dare not resist, and he removed from St 
Andrews to Edinburgh to take charge of the congregation 
there at the earnest request of the Kirk and brethren. They 
referred his returning to his own judgment. He made it a 
condition that he should not be pressed in any sort to temper 
his tongue or cease to speak against the treasonable dealings 
of the Castle of Edinburgh, and received a humble assurance 
that "they never mean it nor thocht to put a bridle to his 
tongue." It was a tongue no man or woman then living could 
bridle, though political necessity had once forced him to soften 
its voice in explaining to Queen Elizabeth his discourse against 
the Regiment of Women. There was more than one text of 
Scripture which Knox and his brethren overlooked, but the 
times required the Scriptures to be searched, as they thought, 
in the prophecies of Daniel or the Book of the Revelation, 
not in the Psalms of David or the Epistle of James. " He 
left St Andrews to the grief," says Bannatyne, " of a few godlie 
that wer in that town, but to the gret joy and pleasure of the

rest, especially to the Balfours, Kirkcaldies, and Hamiltons, 
enemies of God and the King." This was a rigid estimate of 
the numbers of the godly even for the strictest Calvinist. 
The influence of Knox was great while and wherever he 
lived and taught, and did not pass with his death. He left 
behind him many disciples in St Andrews and the other 
burghs of the East Neuk. Fife became one of the parts of 
Scotland which adhered most numerously and firmly to the 
doctrines of the Reformation, as afterwards narrowed and 
adapted by the Covenanters and their successors, to suit 
their special testimonies against their own times. • 

The first print of Lekprevick at St Andrews, in 1572, had 
been a copy in Scots of Buchanan's * Detection of the Douingis 
of Marie Quene of Scottis touching the Murther of her Hus- 
band*; the last, in 1573, was a poem on " Uprichtness," in 
single metre, by John Davidson, regent in St Leonard's, to 
which was added " Ane Schort Discurs of the Estaites, quha 
has cum to deplore the death of this excellent servant of God, 
John Knox." Each of these broadsheets, now mere biblio- 
graphical curiosities, was then a blow in the civil and religious 
war then waging, with a singular exception. *The Taill of 
Rauf Coilzear, quha harbourit King Charles,* issued at this 
time by the same press, is a comic romance which can have 
been printed only to amuse. As during the siege of Paris 
the theatres remained open, so in the storm of the Scottish 
Reformation human nature craved the relaxation of tales and 
plays.

The commencement of the reign of James VI. in Scotland 
was marked by outrages and murders even more than other 
parts of its bloodstained annals. A violent death, with or 
without form of law, was the ordinary fate of a regent or an 
archbishop. Mary's life was for a time safer in an English 
prison than it would have been in a Scottish palace. If 
James exaggerated the attempts on his own life, it was a very 
natural exaggeration. There were feuds everywhere, harrj'ing 
of lands, burning of castles, and slaying of men. With a 
curious mixture of legal forms and criminal intentions, leading 
nobles still bound themselves and their retainers amongst the 
landed gentry in bonds or covenants, duly written by notaries 
with witnesses and seals, to make common cause in offensive 
as well as defensive war. Before what court, save that of

JAMES VI. AT FALKLAND. 95 

Mars, these deadly bonds of Man-rent, as they were called, 
could be enforced, none of the signatories considered. The 
form of warranty in Scottish deeds, contra omnes mortales, or 
in the sterner vernacular against ail deadiy^ is a curious 
survival of the old practice of private war adapted to a time 
when its battles were fought in the court instead of the field. 

Fife, with its many castles and royal residences, was no 
exception from this chronic war. The King himself, like his 
mother and several of his ancestors, had more than once to 
run the risk of kidnapping. It was one of the modes by 
which the feudal nobles limited the Scottish monarchy. 
Another Bothwell attempted to seize his person at Holyrood 
and Falkland, as his predecessor had seized that of Mary. 
The most famous of these attempts was the Raid of Ruthven. 
The Gowrie Plot took place outside, though just outside, the 
borders of Fife. When he fled from Perth, James took refuge 
at Falkland. Fife was still one of the homes of the Scottish 
monarchs. 

The relation of James with the Presbyterian clergy was as 
strained as with many of the nobles. If the latter tried to 
control his person, the former claimed to direct his conscience. 
The one represented an aristocracy unaccustomed to submit 
to royal authority, and the other a democracy to which the 
religious revolution had given a new power. Educated as a 
Presbyterian under George Buchanan, James, like a clever 
boy repelled rather than attracted by a domineering teacher, 
early showed personal inclination to Episcopacy, and a dis- 
position to treat the Catholic nobles with toleration. 

The Presbyterian Church had passed beyond the stage of 
the First Book of Discipline into that of the Second, of which 
Andrew Melville was the chief compiler. Melville was another, 
not a wiser, Knox. With more scholastic learning, a professor 
rather than a minister, with less knowledge of men, and less.

political though perhaps as much ecclesiastical power, he had, 
though not all, some of the eloquence of his great prede- 
cessor, and the same unbending spirit Like Knox, he led 
the Church, and was the chief antagonist of James, as Knox 
had been of Mary. To see Church and State confront each 
other in the persons of their chief rulers had become a com- 
mon, almost a natural, sight in Scotland. 

The conferences with a view to healing, but with the effect of 
widening, the breach between the King and the Presbyterians, 
which took place in Fife, have been described by the lively 
pen of his nephew, James Melville. Their first interview was 
for a different purpose. In June 1587 James came to St 
Andrews, where Andrew Melville was head of the college, then 
called New, afterwards St Mary's. Reformed by his masterly 
administration, it had gained a name far beyond Scotland. 
The King brought with him Du Bartas, a French poet, then 
famous, now little known. He declared his wish to hear 
Melville lecture for the entertainment of his guest But 
Melville, instead of complying with the royal command, 
thought it necessary to assert his independence, and sent a 
rude message that he " had teached his ordinar that day in 
the forenoon " ; to which the King, with the want of dignity 
and arbitrariness which marked his character, replied, " That 
is all ane, I mon hae a lesson, and be here within ane hour." 
Instead of further reluctance Melville came and gave a lesson 
of a kind James was to hear more often than he desired. 
" He treated," says his nephew, " maist clearly and mightily 
of the right government of Christ, and in effect refuted the 
haill Actes of Parliament made against the discipline thereof, 
to the great instruction and comfort of its auditory, except the 
King alane, wha was very angry all that night " — " crabbit," 
as his father had been after listening to a sermon of Knox. 
Next day, Adamson, the bishop, gave a lecture. Andrew

MELVILLE ANSWERS ADAMSON. gy 

Melville, contrary to his custom, attended, and took notes. 
He then caused his bell to be rung at two o^clock, long after 
his ordinary hour, to let the students know that he would 
answer the Bishop. The King remonstrated, and even 
offered to take his four-hours or afternoon meal in the college 
with Melville to prevent the lecture. When Melville insisted 
on giving it, he came with the Bishop, who asked leave to 
answer on the spot. But Melville ingeniously denounced 
only the Papists and their works, ascribing to them, without 
naming Adamson, all the Bishop had said in the morning, 
and proving their contradiction of Scripture with such a 
" flood of eloquence," says his nephew, " that the Bishop was 
struck as dumb as the stock he sat on." The King tried to 
calm matters by a speech in Scotch, in which he enjoined the 
University to reverence his Bishop; while James Melville 
played the part of peacemaker in a fashion his strong lan- 
guage in the Diary would scarcely lead us to expect, by pre- 
paring a banquet of wet and dry sweetmeats, of which the 
King merrily partook before riding back to Falkland. Du 
Bartas remained behind to talk with Melville ; and, according 
to James, expressed his opinion that Andrew Melville's spirit 
and courage was far above the Bishop's. Perhaps this was 
French politeness. 

We owe to the same writer a sketch of an incident which 
brings the history of the East Neuk of Fife into contact with 
the history of Europe. In 1 586, James Melville was presented 
to the parish, which then included Anstruther Wester and 
Easter, Pittenweem, Kilrenny, and Abercrombie. Two years 
later, about Lammas 1588, the coasts of Britain, Fife included, 
were trembling at the news, then abroad, and more alarming by 
its vagueness, that the Spanish Armada was on the seas. It was 
like the alarm in the beginning of this century which gave rise 
to the first volunteers through fear of Napoleon. " Terrible,"

writes Melville, "war the feir, persing war the pretchings, 
ernest, zealus, and fervent war the prayers ; sounding war the 
siches and sobbes, and abounding war the teares at that last 
Generall Assemblie keepit at Edinbruche, when the newes 
war credibile tauld, — sum tymes of their landing at Dunbar, 
sum tymes at St Andrews, and in Tay, and now and then at 
Aberdein and Cromertie Firth." But "the Lord of Armies, 
wha ryddes upon the wings of the winds, the Keipar of his 
awin Israeli, was in the mean tyme convoying that monstrous 
navie about our costes, and directing their hulkes and galiates 
to the ylands, rokkes, and sands, wharupon he had destinat 
thair wrak and destruction." From this general prelude 
Melville proceeds to the particular anecdote which interests 
the student of the history of Fife : " Within twa or thrie 
moneths thairefter," he says, " earlie in the murning, be brak 
of day, ane of our bailyies cam to my bedsyde," in the old, 
not the new manse of Anstruther we now see, which was 
built by Melville three years later, " saying (but nocht with 
fray), I haiff to tell you newes, sir. Ther is arryvit within 
our herbrie this murning a schipe full of Spainyarts, bot nocht 
to giff mercie bot to ask. And sa schawes me that the com-

and verie humble lyk, wha, efter mikle and verie law cour-

a travelled Scot), " he haiffing onlie a young man with him to 
be his interpreter, began and tauld ower againe to us in guid 
Inglis. The sum was, that King Philipe, his maister, haid 
rigget out a navie and armie to land in England for just 
causes to be avengit of manie intolerable wrangs quhilk he 
had receavit of that nation; but God for ther sinnes haid 
bein against thame, and be storme of wather haid dryven the 
navie by the cost of England, and him with a certean of 
Capteanes, being the generall of twentie hulks, upon an yll of 
Scotland called the Fear Yll, wher they maid schipewrak, and 
whar sa monie as haid eschapit the merciless sies and rokes, 
haid mair nor sax or seven ouks [weeks] suffered grait hunger 
and cauld, till conducing that bark out of Orkney, they war 
com hither as to thair speciall frinds and confederates to kiss 
the King's Majestie's hands of Scotland (and thairwith bekkit 
even to the yeard), and to find relieff and comfort thairby to 
him selff, these gentilmen Capteanes, and the poor souldarts." 
Melville replied that their friendship could not be great, 
seeing " they war frinds to the graitest enemie of Chryst, the 
Pape of Rome," but that the bailies granted him licence to 
get refreshment, but not to land any of his men till the over- 
lord of the town was advertised. Next day, the laird having 
come and received them in audience, leave was given to land 
to the number of twelve score, for the most part "young 
berdless men, sillie, trauchled, and houngered." The names 
of the commanders were " Jan Gomez de Medina, generall of 
twenty houlkes ; Captain Patritio, Captain de Legoretto, Cap- 
tain de Luffera, Captain Mauritio, and Senyour Serrano." 
They thought their comrades had escaped harm till Melville 
brought from St Andrews a print of the wreck of the Galleats 
in Ireland, the Highlands, Wales, and other parts of England, 
which he communicated to Jan Gomez, and when he heard 
the same, " O then he cryed out for grieff, bursted and grat.-

100 SPANISH BLOOD. 

But we thanked God with our hartes, that we haid seen them 
amang us in that forme." 

Gomez, on his way home, with Spanish high-bred courtesy 
treated kindly an Anstruther crew detained at Calais, and sent 
his compliments to the Laird of Anstruther, James Melville 
the minister, and the host in whose house he had lived. It is 
refreshing, at a time when men's passions and religious rancour 
ran higher than the sea which wrecked the Armada, to find an 
exchange of good offices between the Catholic Spaniard and 
the Protestant Scot. Nor need we, as the event happened 
otherwise, too curiously speculate what might have been if 
the Armada had conquered, if Philip of Spain had become 
monarch of Scotland in virtue of the will of Mary Stuart, and 
the Inquisitors of the holy office had tried the Reformers in 
Scotland as in Spain. A tradition lingers in the East Neuk, 
as in the Fair Isle, the Hebrides, and the Solway Firth, that 
Spanish blood may be traced in the dark complexion of some 
of the modern inhabitants, derived from the shipwrecked sea- 
men of the Armada too disabled or too poor to return home. 
It is difficult to test this persistent rumour, which has perhaps 
nothing but a pair of black eyes or the bright red dyes of a 
bonnet or a shawl to support it; but when we are told that 
the Gosmans of Anstruther are descendants of Gomez, the 
Spanish admiral, or Guzman, a Spanish grandee, incredulity 
becomes at least pardonable. 

It was not necessary, at the close of the sixteenth century, 
for Scotchmen to look abroad for examples of cruelty. One 
of the most treacherous murders in Scottish history was per- 
petrated in the county of Fife in 1592 by a Scottish noble — 
many thought, probably unjustly, at the instigation of the King. 
The hamesucken and slaughter of the Bonnie Earl of Moray 
has made the place of Donibristle celebrated, though the 
5iouse has been twice burned since that fatal night.

MURDER OF MORAY AT DONIBRISTLE. lOI 

The young Earl of Moray was son-in-law of the Regent, 
and on that account not pleasing to King James. Scandal 
soon after, if not before, reported that the Queen had, in the 
King's hearing, praised him "with too many epithets as a 
proper and gallant man." He was suspected of connivance 
in Bothweirs daring attempt on the King's person. But a 
feud between him and the Earl of Huntly, which had grown 
out of the grant of the lands, as well as the earldom of Moray, 
to his father-in-law by Queen Mary, an earldom the ancestor 
of Huntly once held, was the direct cause of his murder. It 
was interwoven with another feud in the West against the Earl 
of Argyll and the Campbells. Lord Thirlestane, the chan- 
cellor and favourite of the King, was certainly involved in the 
dispute. James himself probably did no more than give his 
signature to a legal warrant, but, like that of William of Orange 
in the affair of Glencoe, his subsequent conduct did not show 
much zeal to punish those who exceeded his orders. A man- 
date was issued to Huntly to apprehend Moray on a charge of 
complicity in Bothwell's plot, and on the 7th of February 1592 
Huntly left Holyrood on the pretence of going to a horse-race 
at Leith. Instead, he crossed Queensferry, stopping the passage 
of all other boats. He had with him some seven score friends, 
and surprised Moray at Donibristle, his castle in the parish of 
Dalgety, between Aberdour and Inverkeithing. Moray had 
come from Darnaway with Dunbar, the Sheriff of Moray, and 
a few followers, in the false belief that the King had forgiven 
him. Huntly's men set fire to the house. Moray, who knew 
his sworn enemy was at his gate, hesitated, says the contem- 
porary narrator, " whether to come out and be slain, or remain 
and be burnt." His faithful friend, Dunbar the Sheriff, went 
out first, that in the dark night he might be taken for the Earl, 
who himself was to escape in the confusion. It happened in 
part as Dunbar, who died for his friend, anticipated ; but the

102 BALLAD OF THE BONNIE EARL. 

Earl, after escaping to the rocks on the seaside, was discovered 
by the silk string of his hood (knapskull tippet) taking fire 
without his knowledge, which betrayed him. Gordon of Buckie 
struck the first blow, and forced his chief, Huntly, to repeat it 
with his own dagger, as Ruthven had forced Darnley when 
Rizzio was murdered. In such deeds no man could trust 
another. Even thieves' honour is unknown amongst assassins. 
Their dastardly cruelty brings into relief the heroic sacrifice of 
Dunbar. 

Moray's last words had been to taunt his enemy with spoil- 
ing a fairer face than his own. His youthful beauty, of which 
he was vain, was celebrated in the diaries of the time before 
it was embodied in the ballad which now is the best known 
version of the story. " He w^as," says Moysie in his Memoirs, 
" the lustiest youth, the first nobleman of the king's blood, 
and one of the peers of the country, who was thus slain to 
the great regret of the hale people." "A comlie personage, 
strong of body as a kemp or champion," says another 
chronicler. The best form of the ballad probably does 
not swerve much from the facts : — 

" Now wae to thee, Huntly ! 
And whairfor did you sae ? 
I bad you bring him wi* ye, 
But forbade you him to slae. 

He was a braw gallant, 

And he rid at the ring, 
And the bonnie Earl of Murray, 

Oh, he might hae been a king. 

He was a braw gallant, 

And he played at the glove, 
And the bonnie Earl of Murray, 

Oh, he was the queen's love." 

Gordon of Buckie, sent to tell James the news, was detained 
at the gate of Holyrood, and denied audience. The corpses

of the Sheriff and the Earl were, two days later, brought over 
by Lady Doune, the Earl's mother, to present them to the 
King, but James escaped the ghastly spectacle by going out 
hunting. He failed to take steps to punish Huntly, and the 
body of Moray lay uninterred in the kirk of Leith for several 
months, "but by common rhymes and songs," says James 
Melville, " kept in fresh memory," until it was probably con- 
signed to the vault in St Giles's beside that of his murdered 
# father-in-law ; but the place of its interment is not certain. 

At the time of his marriage James showed a little more 
disposition than at any other time to accept Presbyterianism. 
He had been accompanied to Denmark by David Lindsay, 
a Presbyterian minister, who performed the ceremony, and 
Andrew Melville was called on to make an oration in honour 
of it on his return. In 1592 he consented to the Act which 
has been called the charter of the Presbyterian Establishment. 
But the leniency shown by the King to the Papist lords, 
Huntly, Enrol, and Angus, as well as his scarcely concealed 
favour for Episcopacy, again led to a rupture between him and 
the ministers. One of them, Mr David Black, a protege of 
Andrew Melville, and minister of St Andrews, made himself 
conspicuous by preaching a sharp and plain form of doctrine, 
sparing neither the King nor his ministers. 

The most dramatic of the interviews between the King and 
the Presbyterian clergy was at Falkland in September 1596, 
when a deputation from the Commission of the General 
Assembly at Cupar was sent to remonstrate with him for 
allowing the Papist lords to return to Scotland. It had been 
arranged that James Melville, as most conciliatory, should be 
the spokesman, and he began a speech, which was often inter- 
rupted by the King, who at last declared that the Assembly 
was seditious. The bolder Andrew then broke in and uttered 
" his commission as from the mighty God," calling the King,

Presbyterians, some of whose ministers were apt to confound 
the invisible Church, of which Christ was the Head, with the 
visible, of which they were the leaders. 

One of the most notable incidents in connection of James 
VI. with Fife, w^as a result of the long period during which 
the Scottish kings had made Dunfermline and Falkland their 
favourite home. This was the attempt to colonise the Lewes 
by a settlement of the gentlemen of Fife. While its immediate 
object ended in a failure as disastrous as the Darien expedi- 
tion, it afforded a precedent for the successful plantation of 
Ulster, and the colonisation of Nova Scotia. It showed that 
Scotland was becoming too small for the increase and energy 
of its inhabitants. It was a shadow cast before of the events 
which were to make Scotchmen amongst the leading colonists 
of the New World, and amongst the foremost adventurers 
in American and Australian settlement, in Arctic or African 
exploration. About the same time, several Fife families sent 
colonists to Orkney and Shetland, where they acquired estates, 
as the Trails of Holland, descendants of Trail of Blebo, the 
Bruces of Symbister, and others. 

The origin of the expedition to the Lewes is obscure. But 
Lindsay of Menmuir, afterwards Lord Balcarres, seems to have 
been one of the chief advisers of the project, and it may be 
fairly conjectured that he found in the county which was after- 
wards to produce Alexander Selkirk of Largo, the original of 
" Robinson Crusoe," a large share of the adventurous spirit. 
His object, one of several in which James showed a premature 
and half-wise statesmanship, was to civilise the wild Scots of 
the west by a graft from the more cultivated and better blended 
stock of the east. His grandfather, in the celebrated voyage, 
conducted by "that excellent pilot," whose name indicates a^ 
Fife mariner, Alexander Lindsay, which first showed a Scottish:

I06 THE CHIEFS ORDERED TO PRODUCE TITLES. 

king the full extent of his dominions, had taken with him to 
the Lewes and Skye some gentlemen of Fife, and so intro- 
duced them to that distant part of Scotland. But it required 
more than an occasional royal visit to curb the lawlessness of 
the Celtic chiefs, the absolute monarchs of their clans. The 
Macleods of Lewes, a race fertile in bastards, not content with 
internal feuds, preyed upon all ships that came to their island 
waters, and according to a Highland chronicle, " They hanged 
so many of the inhabitants of the coast side of Fife that they 
used diligence of law against Roy Macleod and his clan." 
The adventurous fishers of Fife already knew the wealth and 
the danger of the western seas. 

Ordinary law was quite inadequate for the case, and James 
determined to try a more stringent policy. In 1597 an Act 
was passed requiring the chiefs to produce their titles before 
the Lords of the Exchequer on Whitsunday 1598, and to find 
security* for payment of the rents due to the Crown which they 
had long ceased to pay, as well as for the peaceful conduct 
of their followers. Another Act provided for the erection of 
three burghs in Kintyre, Lochaber, and the Lewes. A council 
was organised to advise the king upon the affairs of the West 
Highlands. Its leading members were Lindsay of Balcarres, 
Lord Menmuir, the secretary, and Sir William Stewart, com- 
mendator of Pittenweem. It was natural to choose men of 
Fife, the land of many burghs, seaports, and fishing villages, 
for such a business. When the Lords of Exchequer met at 
Whitsunday, the chiefs, as had been expected, failed to pro- 
duce titles, and the Isles of Harris and Lewes, and the lands 
of Dunvegan in Skye, as well as of Glenelg on the opposite 
coast, were declared forfeited. Lewes was granted to a 
company of Adventurers, of which the chairman, to use 
nineteenth-century language, was the Duke of Lennox. But 
:the directors and shareholders were almost all gentlemen

of Fife : Sir Patrick Leslie, commendator of Lindores ; Sir 
William Stewart, commendator of Pittenweem ; Sir James 
Anstnither, younger of that Ilk; James Learmont, younger 
of Balcomie; and James Spens of Wormiston. They were 
to pay no rent for seven years, in consideration of the cost to 
which they were put, the hazard of their own lives, as well as 
the lives of their kinsmen and friends ; but after that date 
a grain rent of 140 chalders bear was to be paid for Lewes. 
Similar terms were also agreed to with reference to the lands 
of Harris, Skye, Dunvegan, and Glenelg. A member of the 
family of Bethune or Beton of Balfour settled in Skye and 
left descendants. Four parish churches were to be erected 
in the Lewes, and two in Skye, as the King (here some of 
the councillors spoke in his name) was "most careful that 
these gentlemen and their successors should not be destitute 
of the comfort of spiritual pastors for preaching and adminis- 
trating the sacrament." 

A commission was issued to Lennox, as Lieutenant of the 
Isles, which was again renewed in 1599, when the Earl of 
Huntly was joined with him, and both were charged to assist 
the gentlemen venturers and enterprisers of the conquest of 
Lewes. The expedition did not start till October. It in- 
cluded five or six hundred men under wages, besides volun- 
teers. The ill-chosen season, and the lack of lodgings such 
as the gentlemen of Fife were accustomed to, induced disease 
which weakened the force. They commenced building **a 
pretty town," or, as the Highland chroniclers call it, "a 
bonny village." The future Stornoway was then begun, and 
consisted of a few fortified houses or stances, for the burgh 
was never completed. The Macleods rose under Neil and 
Murdoch, two bastards of their last chief. The Fife men, 
under Learmont, were surprised at sea by Murdoch, who 
slew most of the crew, and kept Learmont captive in Lewes

for six months, when he was released on ransom, but died in 
Orkney on his way home. Bannatyne deemed his death a 
fulfilment of a prediction of Knox, but the Highlanders re- 
gretted it, because Macleod lost the ransom of his prisoner. 
A dispute between the two brothers led Neil to side for a time 
with the Adventurers, on condition of his own pardon to 
betray his brother, who was executed at St Andrews, and to 
return as an ally of the Adventurers to Lewes. 

In the following year a new commission was issued to 
Lennox and Huntly, with larger powers and still larger 
promises, but neither took an active part in the enterprise. 
The leaders who returned with Neil Macleod were the three 
Fife lairds, Pittenweem, Wormiston, and the heir of Balcomie, 
the lairds of Fingask in Perth and of Airdrie in Lanark. A 
quarrel between Wormiston and Macleod, abetted by Mac- 
kenzie of Kintail, and Tormood, an illegitimate son of the old 
chief of Lewes, led to an attack upon the camp of the Ad- 
venturers, who capitulated. The terms were ignominious. 
They were to procure a full pardon for the Macleods, never 
to return to the Lewes, to surrender their title to Tormood, 
and to leave Spens of Wormiston, and his son-in-law, Money- 
penny of Pitmilly, as hostages. In 1602 the hostages were 
released, and a remission granted to the Macleods ; but a 
proclamation for a new expedition was issued in July for 
September 1602. Warned perhaps by the mishap of attempt- 
ing it at such a season, it was delayed till the following 
spring. The further attempts for the settlement of the Lewes 
belong more to the history of the West Highlands than to the 
history of Fife, and must be briefly told. 

In 1605 the Adventurers, armed with letters of fire and 

sword — such at times have been the stern, but not always 

successful, methods of coercion — temporarily reduced the

LAST ATTEMPT TO COLONISE FAILS. IO9 

but his brother Neil held out, and, aided by Macneill of 
Barra, Macdonald of Clanranald, and Macleod of Harris, 
prevented anything like a permanent conquest. Other com- 
petitors, Huntly, Argyll, and Mackenzie, chief of Kintail, 
began to contend for a share in barren islands, coveted 
for the extent and not the riches of their soil. In 1607 
the remnant of the original partners of the Fife Company, 
many of whom had died or spent all their means, returned 
to Fife. Kintail, through the favour of the Chancellor, Lord 
Dunfermline, got a surreptitious gift of the Lewes ; but this 
was revoked, and, with the consent of the original Adventurers, 
a new grant was made to three gentlemen, two of whom 
were Fife lairds — James Elphinstone, Lord Balmerino; Sir 
James Spens of Wormiston ; and Sir George Hay of Nether- 
cliff, afterwards Lord Kinnoul : but Hay and Spens, who, 
after the conviction of Balmerino for treason in 1609, once 
more tried to conquer the Lewes, were thwarted by the in- 
trigues of Kintail. They disbanded their forces, and a small 
garrison left in the fort at Stornoway was surprised by Neil 
Macleod, who burnt the fort and sent the garrison back to 
Fife, receiving, besides a money payment, the lands of Let- 
tercurry, which were given him as compensation. 

This was the last attempt of the Lowlanders to colonise 
the Lewes. Hay and Spens sold what they could not con- 
quer to Mackenzie of Kintail, afterwards created a baron. 
This wily chief also got a gift of Balcomie's forfeited share 
of the Lewes adventure. With better knowledge of the 
character of the country and its natives, Kintail, who had 
used the Macleods against the Adventurers, now used the 
Adventurers' title to oust the Macleods. He substituted the 
rule of a Highland chief, who at least acknowledged the 
authority of the king, for one who recognised no law, and 
despised a sheepskin title. The civilisation, in the modern

sense, of this part of the West Highlands, was delayed for 
more than a century. 

Before his accession to the English crown, Falkland and 
Dunfermline were the favourite residences of James. The 
one was resorted to chiefly in summer, for the sake of its 
sport ; the other in winter, as a palace preferable to Linlith- 
gow or Holyrood, with their gloomy memories. In Dun- 
fermline were born his daughter Elizabeth, afterwards the 
Electress Palatine, through whom the house of Hanover 
came to the British throne; his second son, Charles, after- 
wards king; and his third son, Robert, who died young. 
" The greatest honour," writes Sir Robert Sibbald, " this 
shire ever had, was that it gave birth to King Charles, the 
royal martyr, who was born in the Abbey of Dunfermline, 
and baptised by Mr David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, on 
December 23, 1600, — 

" Whose heavenly virtues angels should rehearse ; 
It is a theme too high for human verse." 

A traditional story, true to the character at least of King 
James, presents a different view of the infancy of King 
Charles. One night his nurse broke James's slumber with 
the tale — "There was like an auld man coming into the 
room, who threw his cloak owre the prince's cradle, and 
syne drew it till him again as if he had ta'en cradle, bairn, 
and a' away wi' him. I feared it was the thing that's no' 
canny;" to which the King exclaimed, "Fiend! would he 
had ta'en the girnin' brat clean awa! Qin he air be king 
there'll be na gude a' his ring [reign]; the deil has cussin 
[cast] his cloak ower him already." The last words became, 
perhaps still are, a byword in the town for an unlucky child, 

James, after his accession to the English throne, returned 
only once to Scotland, in 161 7, although he had promised to 
return every third year. It was a paternal example in the

JAMES VL REVISITS FIFE. Ill 

Royal Stuart art of breaking promises. The situation was 
something like that which now exists between Sweden and 
Norway, and had similar effects. Courtiers preferred the 
pleasures and the profits of the Court and capital. The 
people, left to themselves, began to take an independent 
course, which led in a democratic direction. During his 
visit to Scotland, James naturally went to Dunfermline and 
Falkland. He also visited St Andrews, where, no longer 
awed by the presence of Andrew Melville, he made jokes 
on the names of the professors, and presided at disputations 
of the students on the harmless question whether sheriffships 
and other inferior offices should be hereditary. He little 
foresaw how soon the same question was to be put as to the 
royal office. He was greeted with panegyrical verses in a 
very different strain from Melville's lectures. Yet the mur- 
murs of the Presbyterians at the forcible restoration of Epis- 
copacy and of ritual services might have reached the royal 
ears, although the sturdiest maintainers of the principles of 
the Second Book of Discipline had been silenced or banished. 

His visit to Dunfermline, either on this or an earlier occa- 
sion, was marked by an incident illustrative of the progress 
of one of the great industries of Fife. Sir George Bruce of 
Culross took the King to see his coal-mines, which were 
worked at some distance under the sea ; and when the party 
were being drawn up a shaft whose mouth was on an island, 
James, alarmed at finding himself surrounded by water, called 
out " Treason I " as he had done some years before at Cowrie 
House. His timid and suspicious nature was alarmed at any 
unexpected situation, and happy only when surrounded by 
admiring courtiers or jovial boon companions. Scotland was 
not a home for such a faint-hearted prince. 

Charles I. had not accompanied his father, but he came to 
Scotland for his coronation in 1633 ; and once again in 1641,

vainly hoping to raise the Scots against the English Parliament 
in support of the royal prerogative. The coronation was at 
Edinburgh, but he paid a short visit to his birthplace. 
Charles IL, when he accepted the Covenant to gain the 
crown in 1650, made a brief tour round Fife, but, alarmed at 
the arrival of Cromwell, fled to England, and never returned 
to Scotland. No king visited Scotland for nearly 200 years, 
and Fife, which had owed to the residence of the kings the 
charters of its royal burghs, the titles and honours of its land- 
owners, and the careers opened to enterprising merchants and 
younger sons of lairds, suffered at first probably more than the 
rest of Scotland from the absence of royalty. 

The troubles of the civil religious war, which lasted, with 
scarcely an interval, for half a century, from 1638 to 1688, 
also told severely upon the population and prosperity of Fife. 
How it emerged along with the rest of Scotland from this 
crisis, and grew after it stronger, more prosperous, more in- 
telligent than in the days when it numbered kings amongst 
its inhabitants, belongs to a later chapter of its history. 

No portion of its annals is so full of romantic incidents as 
the half-century the outline of which has been traced from the 
Reformation to the Union of the Crowns. But history, like 
life, is not all or chiefly romance. Truth is stronger as well 
as stranger than fiction. Even when history affords fewer 
motives for poetry, it supplies matter for moral and examples 
for political philosophy. The modern history of Fife includes 
only one battle and only one historic murder. Individual 
character, perhaps still as strongly marked there as anywhere 
in Scotland, has no longer so many opportunities to display 
its good and evil on a conspicuous stage. 

Now other and wider interests succeed. We must try 
to follow the improvement of agriculture, the growth of 
manufactures, the adventures by sea and land which led to

MEDIEVAL AND MODERN HISTORY. II3 

the discovery of more than one new world, the planting of 
Scottish colonies, the triumphs of engineering, the reform of 
government and law which has given to all citizens a par- 
ticipation in public affairs, the advance of learning in schools 
and universities, the religious movements, too often sectarian 
in character but deeply influencing many lives. All these 
have left their reflection on the history of Fife during the 
last two centuries. That history, more complex, perhaps 
more difficult to narrate, affords matter more varied than, and 
as instructive as, the history of the times when kings lived and 
princes were born at Dunfermline, when archbishops held 
their courts and heretics were burned at St Andrews. 

Ancient and medieval history have the enchantment of the 
distant view and the halo of time. Modern history comes 
nearer home. Its atmosphere is clearer, its colours less dim. 
We are no longer spectators merely, for the plot, though part 
of it is past or passing, is not yet over, and concerns our own 
and our countrj^'s future destiny. So much the more neces- 
sary is it that truth, the genius of history, should teach us 
neither to exaggerate nor to diminish the value of what is 
most worthy of record. Fife now became part of Great 
Britain. But it had to pass through a period of revolution 
before it received the franchise of the English constitution, 
and the opportunity of aiding in making the larger but not 
yet, as it has been wrongly called, the greater Britain beyond 
the seas.

Two ministers closely connected with Fife represent the 
best aspects of the character of the Covenanters, their 
strong intellect and their fervent piety. The cause which 
converted the head of Alexander Henderson, minister of 
Leuchars, and inspired the heart of Samuel Rutherford, 
Principal of the University of St Andrews, must command 
the respect of impartial judges. It will be necessary to 
record some of its fanatical excesses which were closely 
connected with the history of Fife ; but it is only fair to

HENDERSON THE COVENANTER. II5 

notice also the basis on which it rested, and which gave it 
so firm a hold on men of all classes. 

The Covenant was the work of a Fife author, and its 
importance justifies a fuller account of the life of Henderson 
than might be otherwise proper in these outlines. His par- 
entage is unknown, but it is probable that he belonged to 
the family of the Henrysons of Fordel, between Queens- 
ferry and Aberdour, which just misses also the certainty 
of having a right to claim the Dunfermline poet, and has 
for its only proved worthy the King's Advocate of James 
IV. One account says he was a native of Creich, a parish 
in the north of Fife, and this is supported by his gift to 
its school. Still it may be hoped that the portrait of the 
great Covenanter which hangs on the castle walls of Fordel 
does not represent an imaginary kinsman. His burial in the 
Fordel lair of the kirkyard of Greyfriars confirms the claim 
of relationship, which is not inconsistent with his birth in 
another part of Fife, or the variation in the spelling of 
his surname. Born about 1583, he was educated at, and 
became a regent in, the University of St Andrews. In 
1 61 8 he was presented to the church of Leuchars by Arch- 
bishop Gledstanes, possibly in return for the dedication of 
his graduation thesis to the Archbishop. His settlement 
was so unpopular that when he came to take possession 
he found the doors of the church barred by the parishioners, 
and had to effect an entrance by a window. One of the 
earliest recorded instances of a disputed settlement was that 
of the future leader of the Covenanters. That it should 
have been so, marks the rapid change, within a generation 
after the Reformation, from the submissive attitude of the 
people under the Roman to their independent attitude under 
the Presbyterian Church. Before the Reformation there had 
been many disputed elections to Episcopal sees. But no

Il6 DISPUTED SETTLEMENT AT LEUCHARS. 

one thought it worth while to dispute a presentation to a 
parochial cure. The Reformation in Scotland diminished 
the height of the Episcopal and raised that of the Pastoral 
office. The Congregation of the Church, and on a minor 
scale of the parish, became an independent power. 

The conversion of Henderson the Episcopal presentee into 
Henderson the Covenanting minister was due to a sermon 
preached at Leuchars by Robert Bruce, the minister of Edin- 
burgh, who had been banished beyond the Tay by James VI. 
for refusing to accept the royal account of the Gowrie plot. 
His text had the appropriateness which catches the popular 
ear : ** Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by 
the door into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, 
the same is a thief and a robber." It was natural that this 
text should please the sheep, but not so natural that it should 
touch, as in this case it did, the heart of the robber. When 
Henderson preached in 1638 to the Glasgow Assembly, he 
made, though in general terms, a personal confession. ** Alas ! 
how many of us have rather sought the Kirk, than the Kirk 
sought us ! How many have rather got the Kirk given them, 
than they have been given to the Kirk for the good thereof ! " 
but he pleaded in excuse : " If there were any faults or wrong 
steps in our entry (as who of us are free ?), let us acknowledge 
the Lord's calling of us, if we have since got a seal from 
heaven of our ministry, and let us labour with diligence and 
faithfulness in our office." He could then look back on a 
ministry of twenty years, during which he had never faltered, 
through evil or good report, in the hour of danger and the 
hour of hope, to preach the principles which culminated in 
the Covenant. Like Knox, he paid special attention to educa- 
tion, endowed a school in Leuchars with a schoolmaster's 
glebe and small stipend, the school of Creich with 2000 merks, 
and gave ;^ioo Scots to the St Andrews University Library.

HENDERSON AND THE SERVICE-BOOK. II7 

In 1 6 1 8 he denounced the Five Articles of Perth, and was 
cited before the Court of High Commissioners at St Andrews 
for a book published by him and two other ministers, in which 
they declared the Perth Assembly a nullity. The proceedings 
against him were, however, dropped. The last years of James 
VI. and the first of Charles were a period of more pacific 
policy. It was the lull before the storm. Though sanctioned 
by a statute in 1621, the Five Articles were not rigidly en- 
forced. Henderson, and most of the ministers who opposed 
them, were allowed to conduct services in their own way, and 
to take part in the exercises by which they strengthened and 
prepared themselves for the coming struggle. It came when 
the attempt was made to impose the Service-Book in 1637. 
The Archbishop of St Andrews gave a charge by letters of 
homing, which was the Scottish process of executing decrees, 
adapted from an old feudal form, ordaining Henderson, Hamil- 
ton the minister of Newbarns, and Bruce the minister of Kings- 
bams in Fife, to purchase and use the obnoxious book. Theyr 
suspended the charge, and succeeded in obtaining a judgment 
from the Privy Council, declaring that the letters extended 
only " to the buying of the said books, and no further." The 
supplication to the Council, drawn by Henderson, stated more 
clearly than any other of many similar protests from all parts 
of Scotland, why the ministers refused to conform. The book 
was not warranted, it contended, by the authority of the 
General Assembly, " the representative of the Church of this 
kingdom." The liberties of the tme Kirk and form of 
worship received at the Reformation were warranted both by 
Acts of Assembly and of Parliament, and " the Kirk of Scot- 
land is ane free and independent Kirk, and their pastors 
should be most able to discuss and direct what doth best 
beseem our measure of Reformation, and what may seem 
most for the good of the people." From the day it was pre-

sented, Henderson was marked out as the leader of the move- 
ment When the supplicants met at the tables in the Parlia- 
ment House, he drew the obligatory part of the renewed 
Covenant on the model of the earlier Covenant of the Lords 
of the Congregation; he received a call to the church in 
Edinburgh, though he did not then accept it; he was sent 
along with the Marquis of Montrose and David Dickson to 
Aberdeen to procure the signature of the Covenant and over- 
come the opposition of the Doctors of the University ; and 
when the Glasgow Assembly met in November 1638, he was 
unanimously elected Moderator. Archbishop Laud called 
him " a Moderator without moderation ! " nor can this be 
wondered at when the chief acts of the Assembly were the 
deposition of the bishops and the restoration of Presbyterian 
Church government. 

The short Glasgow Assembly was the Scottish counterpart 
of the English Long Parliament. Scotland remodelled the 
•government of the Church, while England remodelled the 
government of the State. Both can be judged only by a 
revolutionary standard. The conduct of Henderson was that 
of an able party leader, not of an impartial chairman. The 
alleged grounds of the deposition of the bishops were, — con- 
tumacy in not appearing, participation in the Acts relative 
to Church government and ritual, and charges of immorality 
declared proved on none or the slenderest evidence. That 
such charges should have been sustained is discreditable to the 
Assembly and to Henderson. The real ground of deposition 
was the determination of the nation, so far as represented in 
the Assembly, to revert to Presbyterian government. At every 
point in its proceedings — the resolution to continue sitting 
when Hamilton, the Commissioner, dissolved it ; the examina- 
tion of the registers ; the denunciation of Arminianism ; the 
mock trial of the bishops ; the solemn sermon he preached

WITH LESLIE AT DUNSE LAW. II9 

announcing their excommunication ; the abrogation of all Acts 
contrary to Presbyterianism ; the votes of thanks to the nobles 
and the magistrates who supported the Assembly — we hear 
the voice of Henderson. The rest do little more than echo his 
opinions or applaud his speeches, which they no doubt felt 
were the best expression of their own opinions. In his closing 
speech, while asserting there was no inconsistency between 
monarchy and Presbytery, he declared, "We are like a man 
that has lain long in irons, who after they are off and he 
redeemed, feel not his liberty for some time, but the smart of 
them makes him apprehend that they are on him still. So it 
is with us : we do not yet feel our liberty. Take heed of a 
second defection, and rather ertdure the greatest extremity 
than be entangled again with the yoke of bondage." 

The Assembly was the proclamation of civil war, and within 
a few months the troops of the Covenanters confronted those 
of Charles at Dunse Law. Their leader was another man of 
Fife, Alexander Leslie, " the old little crooked soldier," born 
at Balgonie, and bred in the campaigns of Gustavus Adolphus. 
He disciplined and led the troops with the same power of 
command which Henderson exercised in the Assembly. The 
laymen who had l^ept their arms by their sides when at Glas- 
gow, now had them in their hands. The ministers, BaiUie, 
Henderson, Rutherford, Gillespie, and others, were present to 
watch and counsel, to exhort and pray. The blue banner of 
the army was inscribed " For Chrjst's Crown and Covenant," 
in golden letters. Amongst the forces specially noted in 
Baillie's lively description were "Rothes, Lindesay, Sinclair, 
with two full regiments at least, from Fife," Balcarres, a noble- 
man of Fife, with a horse troop, and " the constant guard of 
the General," some hundreds of " our lawyers, musqueteers," 
under two Fife lairds. Sir Alexander Gibson of Durie and Sir 
Thomas Hope of Craighall, "standing in good arms, with

cocked matches and well apparelled." This demonstration of 
strength forced Charles to conclude the Pacification of Ber- 
wick, and reluctantly to allow an Assembly to meet in Edin- 
burgh. 

Bold as was the language and still bolder as were the acts 
of the Glasgow Assembly, in the Edinburgh Assembly of 1639 
Traquair, the King's Commissioner, proposed that Henderson 
should again occupy the Moderator's chair. It was felt that 
he alone could control the fiercer spirits. He pleaded age ; 
and the suspicion of an insidious design to introduce con- 
stant moderators, which would have been a violation of the 
Presbyterian parity, led to the election of David Dickson, 
Minister of Irvine. Henderson, as outgoing Moderator, 
preached the opening sermon, in which he exhorted Tra- 
quair "to see that Caesar should have his own, but let not 
Caesar have what belongs to God." Addressing the members 
of the Assembly, in a tone somewhat moderated from that 
of Glasgow, he said : " After all these troubles, with a holy 
moderation go on ; for zeal is a good servant, but an ill 
master ; like a ship that has a full sail and wants a rudder. 
We have need of Christian prudence; for ye know what ill 
speeches our adversaries have made upon us. Let it be 
shown to his majesty that this presbyterial government can 
very well stand with a monarchical government, and we shall 
gain his majesty's favour, and God shall get the glory, to 
whorn be praise, for ever and ever, amen." Henderson was 
as far removed from the fanatics as from the bishops, and 
he has been claimed as the precursor of the Presbyterian 
Establishment, as well as of the constitutional Dissenters. 
In 1640 he was chosen by the Town Council Rector of the 
University of Edinburgh, and proved himself a wise adminis- 
trator of the higher education, as at Leuchars of the parish 
schools.

PREACHES AT ST ANTHOLINS'S, LONDON. 121 

When the army of the Covenant, finding Charles unwilling 
to keep his engagements except at the sword^s point, invaded 
England, Henderson, along with Blair, Gillespie, and Baillie, 
went as the representatives of the ministers to London to 
negotiate with the King. They remained seven months, the 
opening months of the Long Parliament, and of Strafford's 
trial and death. Henderson was active in the negotiations 
which the Scottish Commissioners carried on at once with the 
King and the Parliament. He lived in lodgings near the 
London Stone, which had been assigned to the Scottish Com- 
missioners by the Corporation, and took his turn in preaching 
at St Antholins's Church. " From the first appearance of 
day," writes Clarendon in his * History of the Rebellion,' " in 
the morning on every Sunday, to the shutting in of the light, 
the church was never empty." It was the first, but not the 
last, occasion when the robust and plain Scottish preacher 
reached the hearts of the London middle class better than 
the refined and learned orators of Oxford and Cambridge. It 
was by such sermons that Presbyterianism was propagated in 
England, and the vision of a united Presbyterian Church for 
both kingdoms was made to appear possible. The last form 
of " The Charge of the Scottish Commissioners against Laud 
and Strafford " was the work of Henderson, though the first 
draft was by Baillie, who modestly assigns " the polishing of 
all writs " to his colleague, and he prepared a paper in support 
of " a proposal for unity in religion and uniformity in church, 
as a special means for conserving of peace between the two 
kingdoms ; " to which the King and Parliament replied that, 
as "the Parliament had taken into consideration the refor- 
mation of Church government, so they will proceed therein in 
due time. 

Henderson did not neglect the interest of the universities, 
and Baillie reports : " Mr Henderson had a very sweet con-

ference with the King, then alone, for the helping of our 
universities from the bishop's rents. I hope it shall be 
obtained. A pitie bot that sweet Prince had good companie 
about him." All the demands of the Scottish Commissioners 
having been agreed to except one for the immediate abolition 
of Episcopacy in England, they returned home in July 1641. 
At this time the Presbyterian leaders, and especially Baillie, 
hoped that as they had gained so many of the Scottish nobles 
and the English Commons, they might even gain the King 
himself. This would have suited their monarchical principles 
and diminished their ecclesiastical dread of the Independents, 
now beginning to show their heads. 

In the Assembly which the Commissioners found sitting in 
Edinburgh, Henderson was chosen Moderator against his own 
inclination and the opposition of David Calderwood the his- 
torian, one of the more stubborn Presbyterians, who thought 
the re-election even of the ablest man contrary to the principle 
of equality. His chief work during it, besides presiding, was 
the * Overture against Impiety and Schism.' It was directed 
against the meetings of the Independents, whose principles 
threatened to spread in Scotland, and were deemed fatal to 
Church unity by High Church Presbyterians. He also 
carried a motion for drawing up a confession, catechism, 
directory for worship, and platform for government, in the 
hope that these might afterwards be accepted in England. 
The task of preparing these was reluctantly accepted by him. 
At the close of the Assembly he petitioned, and with difficulty 
obtained permission, to demit his charge in Edinburgh, but 
did not avail himself of it The King having come to Edin- 
burgh, Henderson acted as his chaplain, reproved him for not 
attending the afternoon service, and conducted family prayers 
at Holyrood morning and evening. That Charles relished 
this discipline any more than his father or his son is not

likely, but he dissembled his dislike better, and Henderson 
probably made his preaching as palatable as possible con- 
sistently with his principles. An immediate and urgent 
common object unites on friendly terms men with different 
ulterior views. 

He was appointed by the Commission of Assembly in 
1642 to go again to England, but for a time was prevented 
by the outbreak of the Civil War. When the King had 
established himself at Oxford, he went there along with 
other Commissioners to attempt to mediate between Charles 
and the Parliament. This attempt miscarried, for the King 
was now over - confident in his strength, and unwilling to 
make concessions. Nor did Henderson succeed better in 
an interview after his return at the Bridge of Stirling with 
his former comrade, Montrose, who now sided with the King 
against the Covenanters. In the Assembly of 1643, Hender- 
son, as Moderator, drafted the Solemn League and Covenant, 
which was revised by Committees of the Parliament of 
England, the Scottish Convention of Estates, and General 
Assembly, and transmitted to the Parliament of England for 
approval. To procure this he was sent to London as one of 
the Commissioners to the Westminster Assembly, and imme- 
diately after his arrival on 25th September, the Covenant was 
sworn and subscribed by the English at St Margaret's, West- 
minster. England was now, so far as the Westminster As- 
sembly by words and oaths could make it, Presbyterian. 

In this Assembly Henderson proved his conciliatory yet 
firm management, even more than in the Assembly of 
Glasgow, where his word had been law. At Westminster 
he had to deal with politicians inclined to subordinate the 
Church to the State, with theologians who deemed Presby- 
tery as devoid as Episcopacy either of divine right or human 
reason, and with Englishmen jealous of Scottish interfer-

124 HENDERSON AT WESTMINSTER ASSEMBLY. 

ence. He had the majority on his side, but he was an 
assessor rather than a member of a body which contaitied 
many elements of division. He spoke seldom, always with 
weight, sometimes, though rarely, with fire. He yielded 
minor points, but upheld without a moment's wavering the 
Presbyterian standard. The compromise with the Inde- 
pendents, which allowed a doctor as well as a pastor in 
congregations, was his suggestion; and he cut by a similar 
compromise the knotty point of whether the ordination re- 
ferred to in the draft of the Articles of the Assembly was 
exclusive or inclusive of popular election. But when Nye, 
an English Independent, attacked Presbytery, and argued 
that a Presbyterian union of the kingdoms would be danger- 
ous to the State, he denounced Nye as an incendiary, com- 
paring him to Sanballat who stirred up heathen rulers against 
the Jews, or Lucian who incited the Roman Emperor against 
the Christians. 

In 1645 he was one of the Commissioners sent to Charles, 
at Uxbridge, but failed, as might have been expected, to 
induce him to surrender Episcopacy. When next year the 
King was forced by defeat to throw himself upon the support 
of the Scottish troops at Newcastle, Henderson was sent for 
by the King, and an argument was conducted in written 
papers on both sides, with a moderation rare in such times, 
between the King and his chaplain. It was again ineffectual, 
for Charles, whatever his faults, was as attached to the Church 
of England as his grandmother had been to that of Rome. 
They parted, however, with mutual respect, Henderson warn- 
ing the King of the consequence of allowing controversy to 
turn upon the Royal Prerogative. He was already in failing 
health, and died a few days after his arrival in Edinburgh, on 
19th August 1646. 

Baillie, who remained in London, thought Henderson was

CHARACTER OF HENDERSON. 1 25 

wasting time in arguing with Charles, and two years after his 
death the report was spread by an anonymous pamphlet that 
he had yielded too much to the Royal arguments; but the 
Assembly recorded its opinion that this was a calumny. The 
erasure of the inscription on his monument in Greyfriars' 
churchyard after the Restoration, was an acknowledgment 
by his opponents that he died as he had lived, a firm Pres- 
byterian. His friend Baillie pronounced in the Assembly 
of 1647 a eulogium often repeated: "If the thoughts of 
others be conform to my inmost sense, he ought to be 
accounted by us and posterity the fairest ornament, after 
John Knox, of incomparable memory, that ever the Church 
of Scotland did enjoy." His textual sermons and argu- 
mentative speeches are not fitted to raise the enthusiasm 
of posterity to this pitch. Neither the Covenant nor the 
Confession, nor the Catechisms, Larger or Shorter, now^ hold 
a place second to the Scriptures. There are many zealous 
Presbyterians who consider the Covenant no longer suited 
to the times, and are ready even to revise the Confession. 

But the high aim of Henderson will not be overlooked 
by the historian, to whatever Church he may belong. That 
aim was the unity of the Church and nation in Protestant 
doctrine and under Presbyterian government. He pursued 
it with statesmanlike perseverance and prudence. He failed 
to secure it, because the human spirit had burst its ecclesi- 
astical fetters more effectually than he was aware of, and 
could no longer be bound by Calvin istic Presbyterian any 
more than by Roman Catholic uniformity; nor did he 
allow for the sense of independence, which was as strong 
in England as in Scotland. That such an attempt should 
have been made, even with partial and transient success, by 
the minister of the small parish of Leuchars, was almost as 
striking a phenomenon as the transient Commonwealth estab-

lished by his successful rival Oliver Cromwell, the representa- 
tive of the Independents. 

The connection of Samuel Rutherford with Fife began 
shortly before that of Henderson closed. His early life was 
spent in the south of Scotland, but his mature years in Fife. 
His settlement at St Andrews is one of many examples of 
the care with which the rulers of the Presbyterian Church 
selected the posts they deemed fittest for the best talents. 
Henderson was the politician, Baillie the historian, and 
Rutherford the divine of the Covenant. Born in Crailing, 
near Jedburgh, in 1600, educated at Edinburgh, and minister 
of Anwoth in Kirkcudbright from 1627 to 1636, he was 
deposed for preaching against the Articles of Perth, and 
banished to Aberdeen during the King's pleasure. He called 
himself Christ's prisoner, and his prison Christ's palace ; but 
his confinement, though it prevented him from preaching, 
does not appear to have been strict. On the Ecclesiastical 
Revolution in 1638 he returned to Anwoth, and was present 
at the Glasgow Assembly. The Commission next year 
appointed him Professor of Divinity at St Andrews, and 
soon after colleague of Robert Blair in the City Church, 
which enabled him to make up for his "dumb Sabbaths" 
at Aberdeen. In spite of the wishes of the congregation, 
who desired to associate with him another minister, he was 
maintained in the sole pastoral charge by the Assembly. He 
was sent as a colleague of Henderson to the Westminster 
Assembly, and remained in London nearly four years. On 
his return to Scotland, he was appointed Principal of St 
Mary's College at St Andrews, and, declining two calls to 
chairs of Divinity in Holland, continued in St Andrews till his 
death on 19th March 1661. Shortly before it he was deprived 
of his offices both in the University and the Church, and one 
of the first Acts of the Restoration was the burning of his

RUTHERFORD'S WORKS. 12/ 

treatise * Lex Rex ' by the common hangman at the market- 
place of St Andrews. In spite of Milton's saying, it was 
better to burn a book than a man ; but though death released 
him from an impending prosecution, and it is possible, but 
scarcely probable, he might have met the fate of Guthrie, 
who was hanged in Edinburgh, there is no reason to suppose 
he would have run the risk of that of Wishart. After a time 
even bigots get tired or ashamed of killing their adversaries, 
and have recourse to other methods of silencing thought. 

Rutherford was an indefatigable writer in the two depart- 
ments of controversial and of devotional theology, not often 
or easily united. He took little part in the debates of the 
Westminster Assembly, and laboured for the common cause 
chiefly in the pulpit or with the pen. He defended Calvin- 
ism against the Arminians, and Presbytery against both the 
Independents and the Erastians. His controversial works 
are now little known, except *Lex Rex,' in which he con- 
tinued and applied the argument of Buchanan's *De Jure 
Regni ' against the Royal Prerogative. Though burnt by the 
hangman, the doctrine of this work has lived and become part 
of the constitutional doctrine of Great Britain. Yet in Eng- 
land this merit is forgotten, and Rutherford is probably only 
remembered by Milton's lines : — 

** Dare ye for this adjure the civil sword 

To force our consciences that Christ set free, 
And ride us with a classic hierarchy, 
Taught ye by mere A. S. and Rutherford ? " 

The most celebrated of his writings are his Letters, pub- 
lished at Rotterdam in 1664, under the title of 'Joshua 
Redivivus,' and since in at least fifteen editions, several of 
London, down to 1857, and one quite recently by the Rev. 
Dr Whyte of Edinburgh. It is difficult to form an impartial 
opinion of a work some have regarded as the most perfect

fruit of piety, others as the ravings of religious ecstasy. In- 
tended for the private eye, these letters are sometimes expressed 
in language drawn from the Song of Solomon rather than from 
the other books of the Bible, and pass the bounds of pro- 
priety in describing divine in terms of human love. They 
will be judged according to the different degrees of the emo- 
tional religious temperament in different persons, or the same 
person at different times. They are in tone nearer the devo- 
tional works of some Roman Catholic writers than the usual 
strain of Protestant authors of similar works. They recall 
St Francis de Sales rather than John Bunyan. They have 
consoled many good men and women in hours of suffering 
and trial, and faults of taste and style weigh little against such 
a claim to respect. Perhaps their exuberance may be most 
fairly considered a relief from the sterner dogmas of the Cal- 
vinistic creed. They are evidently the genuine utterance of 
the heart of " the little fair man," of whom one of his hearers 
said "he showed him in his preaching not the love but the 
loveliness of Christ." 

Yet a third minister connected with Fife was the associate 
of Henderson and Rutherford in the Westminster Assembly, 
the pious and acute George Gillespie, son of John Gillespie, 
the "thundering preacher" of Kirkcaldy. Educated at St 
Andrews, he was presented to the church of Wemyss early 
in 1638, and ordained by the Presbytery "maugre St An- 
drew's beard," without the concurrence of the Archbishop, 
but transferred towards the end of the same year to Methil, 
near Wemyss, where he remained till his translation to Edin- 
burgh in 1642. Having made his name known by a pam- 
phlet, "A Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies 
obtruded on the Church of Scotland," he was chosen to 
preach before the Glasgow Assembly, and, like other ministers, 
followed the troops of the Covenant to Dunse Law.

PATRICK GILLESPIE. 1 29 

In the Westminster Assembly he was the youngest member, 
yet he broke a lance against, and according to the Covenant- 
ing tradition overcame, the veteran scholar John Selden. 
He took part in the composition of the draft of the Confes- 
sion, and obtained its ratification by the Scottish Assembly of 
1647, ^^^ "cxt yc^J* was Moderator of the Assembly. The 
definition of God in the Shorter Catechism is said to have 
been taken from one of his prayers. He died before the 
close of the year at Kirkcaldy. A touching letter to him as 
he lay on his deathbed is one of the best of Rutherford's 
letters. Of his controversial works, that once most widely 
known is * Aaron's Rod Blossoming, or the Divine Ordinance 
of Church Government,' which he dedicated to the West- 
minster Assembly in 1646. There is a somewhat milder tone 
in Gillespie's writings than in those of other Covenanters, 
which seems to correspond with the fine classic features of his 
portrait, not unlike the later portraits of Milton. 

The inscription on his tomb at Kirkcaldy, like that of Hen- 
derson in the Greyfriars', was erased at the Restoration, but, 
like it, has been since restored, and Gillespie, partly because 
of his premature death, has been held in specially affectionate 
remembrance. Many of the stories about him and Ruther- 
ford belong to the legendary history of the Covenanters. 

His younger brother, Patrick, abandoned the cause of the 
Covenant, became the chief supporter of Cromwell amongst 
the Scottish clergy, and received in return from the Protector 
the Principalship of the University of Glasgow. Though de- 
prived of office and for a short time imprisoned after the 
Restoration, he threw himself on the Royal mercy, and was 
pardoned though never reinstated. It is in lives such as his, 
and that of Baillie, who accepted Charles II. as a covenanted 
King, that we see the weakness of the Covenant in the house 
of its friends,

130 OLIVER CROMWELL IN SCOTLAND. 

The modem Ecclesiastical History of Scotland dates from 
Knox, The modem Political History dates from Cromwell. 
It is to his influence and action that the separation of the in- 
terests of the State from those of the Church may be traced. 
He carried Disestablishment, though in a different sense from 
the modern use of that term. His appearance in Scotland was 
only a flash, but it was the flash of lightning which illumines 
even when it destroys. A single year, from the end of July 
1650 to the beginning of August 165 1, was the whole time of his 
presence in Scotland, and of this scarcely a week, from 28th 
July to 3d August 165 1, was spent in Fife. It was enough to 
reveal the weak points both of Church and State in Scotland, 
and for a time to subdue almost all open opposition by either. 

His quarrel with the Presbyterians was on account of their 
acknowledgment as King of Charles II., who accepted their 
Covenant with his lips, hating it in his heart. Nor would 
Cromwell tolerate the assumption by the ministers of temporal 
power. No adversary in that age could have been so fatal as 
one who quoted Scripture as well as any of them, was as 
deeply convinced of his own interpretation of it as they were 
of theirs, and commanded troops better able to carry out the 
practical application of his speeches. He addressed the 
Scottish ministers in memorable words : " I beseech you, in 
the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken." 
Like other users of strong language, he never dreamt that he 
might be mistaken also himself. It was his sword and not his 
texts which triumphed at Dunbar, gave him possession of 
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and laid the south of Scotland at 
his feet. 

It required a minor victory to reduce Fife, and force 
Charles II., whose strength lay in the Highlands, with Perth 
and Stirling as outposts, to fly to England. It was always 
difficult to get the Royalist troops to engage, for there was

BATTLE OF PITREAVIE. I3I 

division in a camp partly commanded by Charles and his 
generals, and partly by the Ministers. There were even 
deserters to Cromwell. The chief force of the King lay at 
Stirling, but Cromwell's generalship succeeded in provoking 
an engagement by threatening Dunfermline. On 17th July 
he sent Colonel Overton with 1600 foot and some horse 
across the Forth at Queensferry, and Major-General Lambert 
followed on the i8th and 19th with two regiments of horse 
and two of foot, to secure the northern landing, and to 
attempt upon the enemy as occasion should serve. The 
occasion came on Sunday the 20th, when the King's forces 
under General Holborn and Sir John Brown, with five regi- 
ments of foot and four or five of horse, were sent to inter- 
cept Lambert. Neither Presbyterians nor Independents kept 
that Sabbath as a day of rest. Lambert met the Royal forces 
between Inverkeithing and Dunfermline, and notwithstanding 
inferior numbers, put them to total rout, killed nearly 2000, 
took 500 prisoners, amongst them Brown the Major-General, 
and forty colours which were carried after Worcester to Lon- 
don to grace Cromwell's triumph. Holborn, suspected of 
treachery, fled, and the whole force being dispersed, Fife was 
at the mercy of Cromwell. 

Two anecdotes of the battle of Inverkeithing or Pitreavie 
rest on tradition, but answer to the character of the time. 
The Highlanders were led by Hector MacLean of Duart, and 
as seven of his sons came to his rescue and met the same 
fate, he saluted them with the cry, "Another for Hector." 
Nearly the whole clan present perished. A few who escaped 
to the castle of Pitreavie were killed by stones thrown from 
its roof while begging shelter. The Wardlaws, the family 
who owned that castle, were said to have gone off like snow 
from a dike as a punishment for their inhospitality, which 
showed the Fife lairds were not all Royalists. But this may

have referred to the laird who died suddenly on 2d March 
1653, it was said with an oath on his lips. The family after- 
wards redeemed its fame, and one of its heads was husband 
of the authoress of the ballad of " Hardyknute." The 
Pinkerton burn ran blood for three days after the battle, and 
the fields through which it flows were " as thick with corpses 
as with sheaves at harvest." Cromwell describes it as an 
" unspeakable mercy," and trusts " the Lord will follow it 
until He hath perfected peace and truth." It was soon 
followed by the bloody victory he called his "crowning 
mercy" at Worcester, which made him master of England 
and Charles again an exile. 

Cromwell had not been at the battle of Pitreavie, which 
he is said to have watched from the woods of Barnbougle, on 
the other side of the Forth, but he can only have seen the 
smoke of the firearms, for the battlefield is hidden by the 
Ferryhills from the Lothian coast. Overton's troops crossed 
to North Queensferry and forced a landing in spite of showers 
of great and small shot The defenders of the Fife coast found 
Cromwell's Ironsides more disciplined and determined foes 
than the marauding troops of the Tudor kings. A few days 
after he crossed to Burntisland. Inchgarvie, then a fort used 
as a prison, now a rock on which one of the piers of the Forth 
Bridge stands, had meantime surrendered, and the possession 
of Burntisland and Queensferry gave him control of the 
Firth. Perth also was taken, so that the passage on that 
side to the Highlands was secured. The King still lay at 
Stirling. The main body of Cromwell's forces, some 14,000 
horse and foot, were now in Fife, waiting, as he expressed it, 
" what way God will lead us." He was greatly gratified by 
the capture of Burntisland, and gave in a few lines a clear 
description of its military importance: "The town is well 
seated, pretty strong, but capable of further improvement in

FIFE TRADITIONS ABOUT CROMWELL. 1 33 

that respect without great charge. The harbour at a high 
spring-tide is near a fathom deeper than Leith, and doth not 
lie commanded by any ground without the town." One of 
his generals, Whalley, marched along the coast of Fife 
attended by a fleet, and took a great store of the guns, as 
well as ships, of the Royalists. The enemy's affairs, he writes 
on 29th July, "are in great discomposure, as we hear. 
Surely the Lord will blow upon them." The tradition that 
he visited the castle of Rosyth, which had belonged to the 
Stuarts, cadets of the Royal race, from whom his mother is 
said to have been descended, does not appear to be histori- 
cally vouched any more than this step in his genealogy. 

Fife reduced, Cromwell was recalled in the first days of 
August across the Firth by the sudden news that the King 
had abandoned Scotland, and was on his march to England. 
The small force left in Fife, stationed chiefly at Queensferry, 
Falkland, and Struthers, was sufficient to levy the cess, to 
support the English judges, and to sow the seeds of one form 
of dissent through the influence of CromwelPs officers and 
chaplains, who made a few converts, and rebaptised them by 
immersion in the Eden. The tradition that Cromwell cause- 
wayed the streets of Burntisland and improved its harbour is 
not accurate, for this was done two years after he left Scot- 
land; but the suggestion and impulse was, without doubt, 
due to him. So, too, the story that the burning of Falkland 
Palace, and the cutting down of the woods James IV. spared 
when sorely pressed for timber for his ships, was the work 
of Cromweirs soldiers is not literally exact; but a wing of 
the palace was in fact burnt when some of his troops were 
quartered in it. Both Royalists and Cromwellians have to 
answer for the fall of the fine trees, of which only one or 
two stragglers survive near Strathmiglo.

134 THE PROTESTERS AT ST ANDREWS ASSEMBLY. 

of this period originated with Cromwell. His influence pre- 
cipitated the disruptions of the Presbyterian Church. The 
Assembly was sitting at St Andrews on the Sunday of the 
battle of Pitreavie, and as soon as it heard of the defeat, 
adjourned to Dundee. Before it left St Andrews, a protest 
was given in by Samuel Rutherford, then minister of St An- 
drews and Principal of St Mary's, subscribed by twenty-two 
ministers, against the lawfulness of the Assembly as corrupt, 
ill-constituted, and not free. The names of some of the 
Protesters, besides Rutherford himself, were Andrew Cant, 
minister of Aberdeen ; James Guthrie, minister of Stirling ; 
Patrick Gillespie, afterwards Cromwell's Principal of the 
College of Glasgow ; and James Simpson, minister of Airth, 
near Alloa. They were the leaders in the east of Scotland 
of the party of Protesters, which opposed the Resolutioners 
who were led by Robert Douglas, Moderator of the As- 
sembly, and formed the party that recognised Charles II. 
as King. The adjourned Assembly at Dundee promptly 
deposed Guthrie, Gillespie, and Simpson, because they had 
preached against the proceedings both of Church and State, 
and remitted to the Commission to deal with the other 
Protesters, "and if they could not be convinced, to process 
them." This was the germ from which grew all subsequent 
secessions, and the standing precedent of the mode in which 
the Conservative party in the Church dealt with them. The 
divisive forces of Scottish sectarianism had their source in this 
revolutionary epoch, but they were supported by a natural in- 
clination of the Scottish intellect not only to independence, 
but also to doctrinal disputes and logical argument, which 
was greater perhaps than in any nation since the Eastern 
Church fought over the words and letters of the Niccne 
Creed. The strong hand of Cromw^ell, and of Monk as his 
lieutenant, maintained peace, silenced the ecclesiastics, and

CROMWELL AND THE MEANER SORT. 1 35 

enforced law in Fife as in the rest of the south of Scotland. 
Almost for the first time Scotland knew what it was to live 
under a firm Government, though a Government of coer- 
cion. Sir Walter Scott, an impartial judge, recognises the 
era of Cromwell as the commencement of the prosperity of 
Scotland. The bulk of the people, the smaller gentry, traders, 
and commons, while grumbling at the heavy taxation, which 
made the name of Cess odious to the landowners and farmers, 
as that of Excise was to the merchants and traders, profited 
by the stern discipline. Their former rulers, both the nobles 
and the leading ministers, were stripped of their exorbitant 
power. There is some exaggeration, but much truth, in 
the claim Cromwell made in his last public speech : " And 
hath Scotland been long settled ? I speak plainly. In good 
truth I do think the Scots nation have been under as great 
suffering in point of livelihood and subsistence as any people 
I have yet named to you. J do think truly they are a very 
ruined nation. And yet in a way (I have spoken with some 
gentlemen come from thence) hopeful enough — it hath pleased 
God to give that plentiful encouragement to the meaner sort 
in Scotland. The meaner sort in Scotland live as well, and 
are likely to come into as thriving a condition under your 
Government, as when they were under these great Lords, who 
made them work for their living no better than the peasants 
of France. I am loath to speak anything which may reflect 
upon that nation ; but the middle sort of people do grow up 
there into such a substance comfortable if not better than they 
were before." 

The Reformers had freed this middle and meaner sort from 
the tyranny of the Roman Church. Cromwell freed them 
from the tyranny of the Nobles, and for a time of the Pres- 
byters. The Restoration threw things back, but the revolu- 
tion thus effected could not be reversed. The middle classes

in Scotland began to prosp^, ftn4 gradually but surely ac- 
quired pQ^ticaI power at the expense both of the nobility and 
the clergy, neither o£ w^om reacquired all they lost. The 
participation of the* meaner sort in politics was not due to 
Cromwell, but to reformers of a later date and different 
character. Cromwell, though he appealed to the lower, was 
the leader of the middle classes. 

War south of the Highland border now ceased. Pitreavie 
was the last battle on the soil of Fife. We hear little more 
of bonds for private war, of spuilzies, hamesucken, and 
murders. In Fife property was more subdivided than else- 
where, and there were fewer places of natural strength. Many 
country gentlemen began to follow the peaceful pursuits of 
learning, or exchanged the combats of the field for those 
of the courts. The merchants grew rich, and the dwellers 
in the towns and villages disciplined their memory and 
reasoning by the study of Calvinistic theology. Those of 
the natives inclined to fight, sought occupation chiefly in 
other countries or in other parts of Scotland, as the gallant 
regiments which had marched with Alexander Leslie to Dunse 
Law, or which perished almost to a man against Montrose 
at Kilsyth. In Kirkcaldy alone it was reported Kilsyth 
made two hundred widows, and in Pittenweem forty-nine. 
Ninety of its choicest men did not return to Crail. The 
younger Leslie, David, afterwards Lord Newark, who was 
born at Pitcairlie, near Newburgh, revenged the death of 
his countrymen at Philiphaugh. Many Fife natives now 
exchanged the love of war for that of adventure by sea or 
land. Castles continued to be built till late in the seven- 
teenth century. But their turrets and battlements presented 
only a mimicry of war, with loopholes from which no shot 
was fired, iron gates no longer barred, turrets from which 
no enemy was descried, drawbridges no longer drawn, and

moats which were drained and became fertile fields. The 
armour and the arms of the sixteenth century, if not beaten 
into ploughshares, were nailed to the walls of the hall, whose 
owner regarded with wonder the two-handed sword his fore- 
fathers wielded, or the coat of mail which had clad their 
stalwart frames. 

In one of the later castles of Fife, whose single unpre- 
tending but striking tower stands on the depression between 
the hill where the generals of Mary of Guise met the generals 
of the Congregation and the ridge of higher ground to the 
west, one of the smaller barons of Fife led a life divided 
between the practice of politics and the pursuit of knowledge, 
from the latter part of the reign of James VI. till his death 
in that of Charles II. One side of the character of Sir John 
Scot of Scotstarvit exhibits a disappointed office-seeker, the 
author of the * Staggering State of Scots Statesmen' — a "busy 
man in troubled times," as he is called by Sir James Balfour. 
But in spite of his unconcealed and natural chagrin at the 
loss of the hereditary office of Director of Chancery to Jaffi-ay 
the Quaker, during the Commonwealth, and to one of the 
Kers of Ancrum, who "danced him out of it" after the 
Restoration, Scot deserved well of his country. No one of 
his class and time did more for learning. He founded the 
Humanity or Latin Chair at St Andrews and scholarships for 
poor boys at Glasgow. He encouraged Arthur Johnston in 
the compilation of the * Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum,' the last 
fruit of the old tree of Scottish Latinity. The sixth volume 
of Blaeu*s Atlas was published largely at his cost. 

It marked a step of progress when Scotland was given a 
distinct place in the Atlas of Europe. "At length," wrote 
Gordon of Straloch to Sir John Scot on 24th January 1648, 
" our Scotland presents itself to the world. It will now hold 
an honourable place among the other countries of the earth

SCOTLAND IN BLAEU'S ATLAS. 



in the grand and celebrated Atlas of Monsieur John Blaeu, to 
which the world has seen nothing comparable." To effect 
this object Scot had enlisted the services of Timothy Pont, 
the son of Robert Pont, minister of St Cuthbert's, but born at 
the hamlet of Shiresmill, in the parish of Culross, and Gordon 
of Straloch, in Aberdeenshire, the most competent draughts- 
man of the time, and spared no effort to get contributors 
and patrons. Pont had been educated at St Leonard's * 
College, St Andrews, where he graduated in 1584. He 
was afterwards minister of Dunnet in Caithness, and he 
received a grant of 2000 acres in the plantation of Ulster, 
which may have been a reward for his map-making. The 
map of Fife in this Atlas, of which a facsimile is given, is 
more than usually well filled with names, no doubt from 
the personal knowledge of Sir John Scot and Pont. There 
are detailed plans both of Cupar and St Andrews. A sep- 
arate map of the little shire of Kinross, made by Gordon 
in 1642, though not published^ is one of the drifts for- 
tunately preserved in the Advocates' Library. His proposal 
to obtain from the ministers of each parish statistics of 
its condition miscarried, though Baillie wrote to his friend 
Spang, " Sir John Scot's petition to have a description of our 
shyredom by some in everie Presbytery to be set before the 
map you have in hand is granted." This project gave the 
hint for the * Statistical Account of Scotland ' which Sir John 
Sinclair carried out more than a century and a half later. 
Imperfect though it is, the work surpasses anything of the 
kind yet done for England or Ireland. Scot kept up an active 
correspondence with the learned men of the Continent, especi- 
ally of Holland, which he twice visited, and where he dictated 
the descriptions attached to some of the maps of Scotland, 
to the admiration of his publisher Blaeu, whose epigram on 
Scot deserves to be recorded —

** Quod Patriae Tabulas, sellers quas Pontius olim 
Descripsit, densis eruis e tenebris,

Sumebat nomen vel sibi Scote tuum.'* 

The alliance between Scotland and Holland, which succeeded 
the old alliance with France, was nowhere closer than in Fife. 
It was cemented by ecclesiastical and political sympathies, 
by mercantile and literary commerce. Dysart got the name 
of Little Holland. A Scottish Church was founded at Rotter- 
dam and other towns, and a church in the Dutch style was 
built at Burntisland. There was a curious interchange of 
learning. The Dutch sent books to Scotland and the Scots 
professors and students to Holland, who learnt in the hos- 
pitable republic the virtue of toleration and the sciences of 
Theology, Medicine, and Law. 

The hospitable house of Scotstarvit was a centre for the 
literary circle of his countrymen. One of Scot^s visitors — 
his brother-in-law, Drummond of Hawthornden — was induced 
to write the * History of the Jameses * by his suggestion, and 
has left a memorial more intimately associated with Fife in 
the " Polemo - Middinia." This poem celebrates in mock 
heroics and rollicking macaronic hexameters the contest 
between the people of Vitarva (Scotstarvit) and those of 
the neighbour laird, the father of Drummond's first love, Cun- 
ningham of Bams (Nebarna), about a road to a midden : — 

** NymphjE quae colitis highissima monta Fifaea, 
Seu vos Pittenwema tenent, seu Crelia crofta,

The combatants were well-known characters, whether the 
combat was real or imaginary : —

Et Jamie Richaeus, et stout Michel Hendersonus 
Qui jolly tryppas ante alios dansare solebat 
Et bobbare bene, et lassas kissare bonaeas ; *' 

with too many more to name at length, though a word may 
be spared for the village fool, Jockie Robinson, " the Norland- 
bornus homo, valde valde Anti-Covenanter nomine Gordonus," 
and another local character, the " slavery-beardius homo qui 
pottas dightavit." 

The whole piece is of the soil and air of Fife. Its coarse 
rustic humour continued the vein of Lyndsay^s * Interludes,' 
and was carried on in the "Anster Fair" of Tennant. But 
the different genius of the authors, and the change of fashion, 
give each poem a distinct form and flavour. 

Arthur Johnston, another of Scotstarvit's friends, also merits 
a passing notice for the graceful Latin verses he turned on 
the chief towns of the county. 

Nor was Scotstarvit a solitary tower of light. Alexander 
Cunningham of Barns deserves grateful recognition for having 
maintained the beacon of coals on the May in 1636, the 
first of the Northern Lights which have guided the Scottish 
sailor on so many voyages, and welcome the ships of all 
nations, who now seek its shores not for plunder but for 
trade. Mr Geddie, a scholar of St Andrews, made two Latin 
lines to commemorate it and its date. Sibbald is responsible 
both for their Latinity and numerals : —

THE BALFOURS OF DENMYLN. I4I 

of Fife in the Forth contains the history of two centuries 
and a half of progress in the beneficent art which illumines 
the path of all who traverse the sea. 

At Denmyln, another small and frugal castle by the road- 
side, about a mile from I^indores, Sir James Balfour, jpne 
of ten Lyon Kings who were Fife lairds from the fifteenth to 
the seventeenth centuries, united the study of heraldry with 
the study of history, and collected the manuscripts from which 
much of the authentic annals of Scotland have been written. 
One of his brothers, David, became a Judge of the Court of 
Session, like other Fife gentlemen, from Balfour of Mont- 
quhanie to Boswell of Balmuto. The youngest, Andrew, a 
traveller, naturalist, and physician in London, was deemed 
worthy of a place beside the illustrious Harvey, and returning 
to his own country reflected credit on a name distinguished 
by other men of note as the founder of the Botanic Garden 
of Edinburgh. He was the father of Scottish botany as well 
as of modern Scottish gardening, and left a successor in 
another gentleman of Fife, Sir Robert Sibbald of Gibliston, 
who was educated in Leyden and returning home spared time 
from the arduous profession of surgery to continue the work 
of both the Balfours. Sibbald was a diligent, somewhat 
whimsical and eccentric, observer of nature, as well as col- 
lector of antiquities. His surveys of his own as well as a few 
other shires are the basis from which subsequent Scottish 
county historians start. 

In these days learning was neither despised nor rare 
amongst the Scottish gentry. They not only bought but ^ 
read and wrote books; the library was at least as favourite 
a part of the castle as the stables or the kennels are now. 
The fashion of London was not yet a successful rival to the 
purer pleasure of a country home. One of the Lindsays, 
after trying a courtier^s life a little, retired and spent the rest

142 SHARP OF CRAIL AND THAT ILK. 

of his life happily at Balcarres, to the disappointment and 
wonder of Charles II. and his courtiers. Another Fife laird 
of somewhat later date entailed his library, prohibited his 
heir from lending books, but bound him to allow free access 
to pie neighbouring gentlemen, and a basin with water and a 
towel for the use of the readers — one of the humorous touches 
in which writers of their own wills sometimes indulge. 

It is painful to leave such honourable and honest employ- 
ments to notice what is fortunately the last historic murder 
that stained the soi^of Fife. But history cannot choose events. 
The assassination of Archbishop Sharp is too memorable and 
significant to be overlooked. Though not born or educated 
in the county, Sharp, from the time when he became minister 
of Crail till his death, was intimately connected with it. 
The Judas of the stern sons of the Covenant, the most Holy 
Martyr of his monument, which looks now somewhat strange 
on the wall of the Presbyterian Town Kirk of St Andrews, 
Cromwell probably hit the mark with his usual shrewdness 
when he called him Mr Sharp of that Ilk, after the conference 
in which his plausible tongue persuaded the Protector that it 
was for his interest to favour the Resolutioners or Moderate 
Royalist party amongst the Scottish clergy against the irrecon- 
cilable Protesters, who would be as ready if necessary to pro- 
test against Oliver as against Charles. When the tide began 
to turn at Cromwell's death, he went to Breda, and made 
himself still more agreeable to Charles II. He had the courtly 
manners found then in a section, though a small section, of the 
Presbyterian ministers, and seemed predestined to a bishopric. 
Charles and his political advisers soon gauged and knew their 
man. But one of his early friends, James Douglas, a chaplain 
in the army of Gustavus Adolphus, whose air of greatness gave 
rise to the story of his descent from George Douglas of Loch- 
leven and Mary Stuart, refused to call him brother, and after-

CREATED ARCHBISHOP. I43 

wards taunted him with the easy conscience which allowed 
him to accept the archbishopric. 

After the Restoration, he was sent to London by the 
Presbyterians to protect the interests of their Church, which 
trusted him and Lauderdale (as they afterwards trusted, \^ith 
better results, Carstares and Melville) to secure the Presby- 
terian Establishment and prevent the King from breaking 
the covenant which he had sworn. No one knew better 
than Sharp how to use words to conceal thoughts. It is 
difficult to put the finger, in his voluminous, and, in spite 
of his clear handwriting, wearisome correspondence, on the 
precise moment when he deserted Presbytery for Episcopacy. 
His palliators till lately maintained he merely moved with 
the times, and that, always favourable to a moderate view of 
the claims of the Church in relation to the King, and alarmed 
by the violence of the fanatics, he gradually acquiesced in 
rather than assisted the restoration of Episcopacy and the 
Royal supremacy as the best settlement for the peace of a 
distracted country. The fuller publication of the Lauderdale 
papers has established the substantial truth of the adverse 
view of his character taken by his contemporary the Episcopal 
historian Burnet and the Presbyterian historian Wodrow, who 
had been distrusted as partial, and certainly had no -liking 
for Sharp. 

In March and April 1661 he was corresponding with his 
Presbyterian friends, indignant at the " clandestine whispers " 
that he was trimming, and "commits himself to his faithful 
Creator, who will bring his integrity to light." But before he 
left Edinburgh he had been in correspondence with Middle- 
ton, and as soon as he came to London, with Clarendon and 
the English bishops. On loth June he drew the proclama- 
tion for " the disposing of minds to acquiesce in the King's 
pleasure," and went back with it to Scotland. In November

he was nominated, and on 1 5th December consecrated, Arch- 
bishop of St Andrews at Westminster Abbey, when he re- 
luctantly submitted to a private ordination as deacon and 
priest, thereby acknowledging the invalidity of his Presby- 
terian orders. Along with three other new bishops — Fair- 
foul, Hamilton, and Leighton — he drove in a coach to the 
North in the beginning of the next year. The saintly 
Leighton, one of the rare spirits who have lived in later 
times the lives of the first disciples of Christ, and truly 
aimed at healing the divisions of Christendom instead of 
promoting the exclusive claims of their own divided branch, 
refused the title of Lord, and disliking the ceremony of a 
public entry into Edinburgh, left his companions at Mor- 
peth. Burnet, who saw the entry of Sharp and Fairfoul, 
notes: "Though I was thoroughly episcopal, yet I thought 
there was somewhat in the pomp that did not look like the 
humility that becometh their function." So well had Sharp 
dissembled, that Robert Baillie, who had been for twenty 
years his friend, and was now near death, only began to 
suspect him in October 1661. 

When he took possession of his see the following April, 
he made a triumphal progress from Leslie, the house of the 
Earl of Rothes, to St Andrews, attended by seven hundred 
horsemen — the Earl of Rothes riding on his right and the 
Earl of Kellie on his left, but only two ministers. In his 
sermon, preached, as a malicious Presbyterian hearer noted, 
from a velvet cushion, he diverged from his text, " I deter- 
mined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and 
Him crucified," to vindicate Episcopacy, the want of which, 
he said, had caused nothing but troubles and disturbances 
in Church and State; and closed by observing that if the 
arguments he ofiered were not convincing, he had " more 
powerful ones in reserve." In the Synod a Presbyterian spy.

CONDUCT AS ARCHBISHOP. 1 45 

who had hidden under the seats, reported that when the 
minister of Leuchars complained of the growth of Popery, 
Sharp replied : " Let that alone. Let us take care to bear 
down the fanatics, our greatest enemies." It is impossible 
to credit implicitly evidence so obtained. To those who 
know the free manners and outspokenness of the labouring 
class in Scotland, there will be more verisimilitude in the 
story that when the Archbishop found his gardener in the 
garden of the Priory struggling with an obstinate weed, and 
asked its name, the gardener answered : " Ay ; it's a bitter, 
bad weed. They ca' it Bishopry ; and when it ance gets in, 
it's no' easily got out." Whether rightly called a weed or a 
flower, the popular leaders of Scotland in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries found no great difficulty in rooting it out 
of the garden of their Kirk. 

The conduct of Sharp as Archbishop was of a piece with 
its commencement. He deserted Lauderdale for Middleton, 
and then Middleton for Lauderdale, and that adroit political 
manager got him restored to the favour of the King. " His 
majesty's hand with the diamond seal was to me," he writes 
to Lauderdale, "as a resurrection from the dead." He took 
part in some of the worst acts of the Privy Council, and 
especially in one which led to his own death, the retrial and 
execution in the beginning of 1678 of Mitchell, who had 
attempted his life, but made a confession on promise of 
pardon. He procured the restoration of the Court of High 
Commission. He removed the monumental tablet in the 
kirk of Kirkcaldy erected to the memory of George Gillespie. 
He showed as much of the zeal of a pervert as was compatible 
with a temper naturally diplomatic. 

On the afternoon of 2d May 1679, Sharp crossed the 
Forth, and lodged that night in Captain Seton's house, still 
standing in the village of Kennoway, though another old

146 MURDERED AT MAGUS MUIR. 

house in the same close, nearer the churchyard, has also 
claimed to have been his last resting-place. Next morning he 
took the road to St Andrews, accompanied by his eldest 
daughter, in a coach and six — the one, perhaps, which he had 
brought from London for his ceremonial entry, for in Scot- 
land coaches and six were rare. He was attended by four 
servants, besides his coachman and postilion, but without a 
guard. He stopped at Ceres and smoked a pipe with the 
Episcopal incumbent, Alexander Leslie, then drove on over 
the still bleak, but then bleaker, Muir of Magus, to the point 
where the distant towers of St Andrews greet the eye. 

A party of nine Covenanters, headed by the Fife lairds 
Hackston of Rathillet and Balfour of Kinloch, .were riding that 
day on the lookout for Carmichael, formerly a bailie of Edin- 
burgh, promoted by Sharp to be Sheriff of Fife, and odious as 
the executor of the severe laws against conventicles. A boy, 
loitering about the road, told them he had seen the Bishop's 
coach coming towards Blebo. They deliberately put to the 
vote whether they should seize the opportunity Providence, as 
they thought, had put into their hands, and decided in the 
affirmative, Hackston declining to act as a leader, because he 
had a private quarrel with Sharp. Balfour accepted the 
duty, for such he deemed it. The Bishop, when he saw them 
approach, called to his coachman to drive on ; but the fore- 
most horseman rode up to the window, shouting " Judas is 
taken ! " and fired into the coach. The other seven came up. 
Hackston, with a curious casuistry staying apart, looked on 
during the three-quarters of an hour which his comrades took 
to complete the slow murder of their victim. Wallace, one of 
Sharp's servants, attempted to discharge his carbine, but was 
disarmed before he could fire ; while the postilion, who had 
never sat in the Privy Council, and whose only crime was 
that he refused to stop, was struck with a sword, which cut

off part of his chin. The commander then said, almost re- 
peating the words of James Melvin when he slew Cardinal 
Beaton : " I take God to witness, whose cause I desire to 
own in adhering to this persecuted Gospel, that it is not out 
of hatred to thy person, nor for any prejudice thou hast done 
or could do to me, for which we intend to take thy life, but it 
is because thou hast been, and continues to be, an avowed 
opposer of the flourishing of Christ's kingdom, and murderer 
of His saints, whose blood thou hast shed like water." Another 
of the band said to the Bishop, "Judas, repent;" to which he 
replied, "Save my life, and I will save yours." His assailant re- 
joined, " It is neither in your power to save us nor to kill us," 
and repeated a similar protest to that of the commander, refer- 
ring specially to Sharp's share in the blood of James Mitchell 
and James Learmonth. The commander then fired his pistol, 
and one of his comrades wounded the bishop with a shabble 
or pike. He at last came out of the coach, and while on his 
knees praying for life, was struck with two other wounds to 
the ground. More blows followed. His daughter cried 
from the coach, "This is murder!" to which she was an- 
swered, "Not murder, but God's vengeance on him for 
murdering many poor souls in the Kirk of Scotland." His 
footman called out he was dead; but one of the band, 
determined to make sure, alighted from his horse, and, 
thrusting his sword through the body till the blood spurted, 
said, "I am sure he is dead now." 

His coach and portmanteau were then searched, and his 
papers carried off, but nothing particular was found except a 
brace of French pistols he had not used, and a Bible with 
portraits of Christ and the saints, the possession of which was 
deemed a greater sin than carrying pistols. When they opened 
his tobacco-box they found neither tobacco nor secret papers, 
but a bumming bee flew out. This either Rathillet or Balfour

called his familiar ; and some of the company, not understand- 
ing the term, they explained it to be a devil. Leaving the 
coach driven some paces off the road, the whole nine then 
rode to a place some three miles off, where they put up 
their horses and prayed jointly, thanking God for what He 
had permitted them to do. After resting till nightfall, and 
praying repeatedly, publicly and privately, they removed 
"with as much composure of spirits as their hearts could 
wish." This brutal murder modified the opinion, which 
would otherwise have been general, of the character of 
Sharp. He had been, not unnaturally, distrusted even by 
the Royal ministers. He had made himself indispensable 
by his power of management, but they disliked his slippery 
ambition and growing pride. The Covenanters would to a 
man have signed the character his murderers expressed. 
But such good points as he had were now remembered. All 
but bigoted partisans recalled his general charity, good offices 
to his friends, and domestic virtues* Like Laud, he became 
the Episcopal as Charles I. became the Royal martyr. He 
had been slain almost in his daughter's arms; and the 
crimes with which he was charged, with the exception of 
the death of Mitchell, were not so flagrant as those of the 
Cardinal. The slaughter of Beaton in his fortified castle 
more nearly resembled an act of war than a murder perpetrated 
on the open country road upon a defenceless old man. 
"His memory," says Burnet, who disliked him, "was treated 
with decency even by those who had little respect for him 
during his life. The dismal end of that unhappy man struck 
all people with horror, and softened his enemies with some 
tenderness." 

When Sir Walter Scott drove over the same road to St 
Andrews, and told his companions on the spot where it was 
done the story of the death of Sharp, it is no wonder his

HACKSTON OF RATHILLET. 1 49 

hearers shuddered. A print of a well-known picture of the 
scene is still to be found in many of the country houses 
of Fife, and preserves its memory. The portrait of Sharp 
by Sir Peter Lely, the painter of Charles II. 's mistresses, 
shows delio^te features, white locks, bright eyes, fine thin 
lips, and a strongly marked clear-cut nose. Another por- 
trait, painted by his daughter, and now in the house of 
Blebo, presents the same well-marked handsome features. 
The verdict of history must be that, while no special plead- 
ing can justify the deed, neither can it justify the character 
of Sharp. He belongs to the sad list of Churchmen whose 
chief aim has been personal advancement, not the good of 
the Church or the people. Those of his assassins find a 
place in the no less painful catalogue of religious fanatics 
who have blasphemed their Maker by using His name to 
cover the crime of their own ungoverned passions. 

David Hackston of Rathillet, in the parish of Kilmany, one 
of the murderers of Sharp, carries us back to the beginning of 
the long series of protests, dissents, secessions, and disruptions, 
which mark the independent and divisive character of the 
Scottish Presbyterian Church. A modern Romanist might 
add another chapter to the History of the Variations of Pro- 
testantism, drawing examples wholly from the ecclesiastical 
history of Scotland, or indeed of Fife. But if he attempted 
to write it, a modern Protestant would reply that in these 
variations there was more of life and hope than in the passive 
acceptance of incredible medieval and the invention of modern 
dogmas, not really believed in by the best Romanists, or only 
believed in by the aid of the doctrines of development and 
accommodation of the subtle masters of modern casuistry. 

Our task now is to trace the origin and progress of the 
ecclesiastical secessions connected with Fife. When the poli- 
tical interests of Scotland had been swallowed up in those of

ISO EXECUTION OF HACKSTON. 

Great Britain, the ecclesiastical movements form the main 
current of the local as of the national history of Scotland for 
more than a century. 

Hackston, after a wild youth, had been converted by the 
field-preachers to a wild faith. The murder of Sharp was 
deemed an act of faith, and Hackston, when obliged to quit 
Fife, joined the Covenanters in the western shires, contributed 
by his courage to the defeat of Claverhouse at Drumclog, and 
was one of the last to leave the field at Bothwell Brig. On 
2 2d June 1680 he was taken at the encounter of Airdsmoss 
by another Fife laird of opposite principles, Bruce of Earlshall, 
the ancestor of the Earls of Elgin, whose tomb may be seen 
in the church of Leuchars. He was brought to Edinburgh, 
and led from the Watergate through the streets on a bare- 
backed horse, with his face to the tail and his feet tied under 
the belly. The head of Cameron, who had been slain at 
Airdsmoss, was carried before him on a pole to the Tolbooth. 
On 24th July, and again on the 28th and 29th, he was brought 
before the Council and asked, among other queries, "Whether 
the killing of the Archbishop was murder ? " to which he re- 
plied, ** He thought it was no sin to dispatch a bloody mon- 
ster." He also disowned the King's authority, and was con- 
demned and executed at the Cross on the same day with a 
barbarity which had ceased to be common. His head was 
fixed on the Netherbow, one of his quarters with his hands at 
St Andrews, another at Glasgow, a third at Leith, and the 
fourth at Burntisland. The choice was not accidental. It 
was a recognition of the share of Fife in the Cameronian doc- 
trines and in Hackston's life. One of Hackston's hands was 
buried at Cupar, where an inscription, frequently renewed, 
still declares — "Here lies interred the heads of Lawr. Hay 
and Andrew Pitilloch, who suffered martyrdom in Edinburgh, 
July 13th 1 68 1, for adhering to the Word of God and Scot-

land's Covenanted Work of Reformation, and also one of the 
hands of David Halkston of Rathillet, who was cruelly mur- 
dered at Edinburgh, July 30th 1680, for the same cause." 
And on the obverse — 

** They Halkston's body cut asunder, 
And set it up, a world's wonder, 
In several places to proclaim 
These monsters gloried in their shame." 

Richard Cameron, whose name was given to the Camero- 
nians, or Society men, the most logical and most fanatical of 
all the Scottish sects, was also a native of Fife. His house of 
three storeys, with a yellow harled front and high thatched 
roof, still stands on the south of the square in the main street 
of Falkland. The Hackstons of Rathillet had a house in the 
same small town, then the precincts of the Court, now a smaller 
village. As cathedral towns have produced the most vehe- 
ment Dissenters, so the most determined anti-Royalists were 
bred in the vicinity of the palace. The son of a general 
merchant or dealer, he had been precentor and schoolmaster 
to the Episcopal curate, but, like Hackston, was converted to 
Presbytery by the field-preachers. Afterwards tutor in the 
family of Scot of Harden, he refused to attend the services of 
the indulged ministers, fled to Holland, where he received an 
indefinite ordination, and returning, instead of assuming a 
pastoral charge, placed himself at the head, along with Donald 
Cargill and Hackston, of the irreconcilable party amongst the 
Covenanters, who were most numerous in the western shires. 
Their principles, embodied in the Queensferry Declaration 
and the Sanquhar Proclamation, were that Charles having per- 
jured himself by breaking the Covenant, was no longer king ; 
that while they would submit to any civil government which 
owned the supremacy of Christ as King, they would acknow- 
ledge no other either by word or deed, would accept no Royal

indulgences, and would prove, if need be by their deaths, their 
allegiance to their Lord and Master. 

Before the fight at Airdsmoss Cameron had washed his 
hands with more than usual care, and looking at them, said, 
"It was need to make them clean, for there are many to 
see them." He died praying " Lord, take the ripe and spare 
the green," for many young men followed him. The Head- 
ship of Christ as a political doctrine, which became to so 
many since a phrase admitting of modifications to suit the 
times, was to these men a reality. Their testimonies, sealed 
by their sufferings, in spite of a somewhat theatrical character, 
command a measure of respect even from those who in later 
peaceful times think the martyrs of the Covenant committed 
fatal errors. 

Amongst the tragic anecdotes of the " killing times " few 
are more pathetic than that of the exhibition of the head 
and hands, which were " very fair," of Cameron to his aged 
father, a prisoner for the same principles in the Tolbooth, 
who recognising, kissed them and said, " They are my dear 
son's. It is the Lord, who cannot wrong me nor mine, but 
has made goodness and mercy to follow us all our days." 
When fixed to the Netherbow Port of Edinburgh, one of 
his declared enemies exclaimed, "There are the head and 
hands of one who lived praying and preaching and died 
praying and fighting." We must remember, as at the time 
of the Reformation, that murders such as those of Sharp 
and Ayton of that Ilk, a Fifeshire Royalist laird, and deaths 
like those of Hackston and Cameron, were the retaliatory 
acts of religious war, not to be judged by the standard of 
happier times. Yet even war and executions may be con- 
ducted without the cruelty which by a fortunate dispensation 
recoils upon its perpetrators. Let us close almost the last 
chapter of barbarity in the annals of Scotland and the last

in the annals of Fife, with the hope that such times may 
never return. 

Modern history need not regret to leave the attraction of 
stories of blood and murder to the realistic novelist, who 
commits murder without committing crime, and spills blood 
as if it were water without injury to any one except himself.

The Revolution of 1688 brought peace with toleration, and 
the Union, after a short interval, brought prosperity with 
trade to Scotland. Fife, which had been described before the 
Union as the " heartiest and happiest part of Scotland," felt 
for a time the loss of a Court, and still more of the intimate 
connection with the Continent. It suffered perhaps most of 
all by the diversion of the main channel of commerce from 
the Forth to the Clyde, on whose banks lay the natural ports 
for the New World across the Atlantic. A humorous poem 
of the beginning of the eighteenth century, " The Speech of 
a Fife laird newly come from the Grave," after describing the 
change and decay of Fife since his death, proceeds —

OLD FIFE LAIRD ON NEW FASHIONS. 1 55 

" O ! this is strange, that even in Fife 
I do know neither man nor wife, 
No Earl, no Lord, no Laird, no People, 
But Leslie and the Markinch steeple ; 
Old noble Wemyss, and that b all, 
I think, enjoy their father's hall." 

He then tries to discover the cause — 

** Some say the Fife laird ever rues 
Since they began to take the Lews. 
That bargain first did turn their bale, 
As tell the honest men of Craill ; 
Some do ascribe their supplantation 
Unto the Lawyer's congregation. " 

But he attributes it himself to foreign fashions and extravagant 

habits — 

" When I was bom at Middle Yard Wight, 
There was no word of Laird or Knight ; 
The greatest style of honour then 
Was to be titled the goodman. 
When we did whiles meet at the hawking. 
We used no Cringes, but Handshaking, 
No Bowing, Shouldering, Gambo scraping. 
No French Whistling or Dutch Gaping ; 
We had no garments in our land 
But what was spun by the good wife's hand." 

The old laird then gives a tedious though instructive list of 
the new-fangled dresses worn by lairds and ladies, and in the 
spirit of a praiser of the past describes the men of his own 
time as 

** Stout for our Friends on Horse or Foot, 

True to our Prince, to shed our Blood 

For Kirk and for our Common Good.'* 

The Jacobite risings left few memories in Fife. The later 
Stuarts found few supporters amongst the lairds and none 
amongst the people of that county. The Earl of Mar landed 
in Fife in 1715 to avoid the southern ports of the Forth, 
but went straight to the Highlands to raise his standard and

gather his men. When Brigadier Mackintosh of Borlum 
made his daring but bootless descent on Edinburgh, the 
fishing-boats by which he passed his troops across the Forth 
were requisitioned at Pittenweem, Anstruther, and Craill, not 
given by the free will of their owners. Only ten landed 
gentlemen of Fife and Kinross appear in the list of rebels of 
1745. The Earl of Kelly is the single name of note, though 
another strikes us by its unexpectedness, Helenas Hackston 
of Rathillet. Rebellion ran in the Hackston blood. 

Fife, however, would not have been true to its character if 
some of its natives had not adhered to opinions opposed to 
the majority of their neighbours. Episcopal congregations, 
which during the eighteenth century meant Jacobite sym- 
pathies, still met half secretly in several of the little towns 
from the East Neuk to the western corner of the shire. Mrs 
Bruce of Clackmannan, a lady of ninety when Burns visited 
her in 1787, gave as her first toast, " Awa Uncos." She was 
as much or more a Jacobite than the poet, and knighted him 
with the two-handed sword of Bruce, observing with sly 
humour that she had a better right to confer the title than 
some people. 

Their losses at Kilsyth are said to have given the men of 
Fife a distaste for fighting, and the few who fought at Sheriff- 
muir were on the side of the Constitution. The armies which 
took part in the Peninsular and Continental wars of last 
century raised recruits in Fife, and there was a regiment of 
Fife Fencibles, but Fife has not bred so many soldiers in 
recent times as the Highlands. 

The natives of the county devoted themselves more to 
industrial pursuits, bore the strain of the Union upon their 
trade, practised economy, cultivated the old and invented 
new industries. Before tracing this portion of its history, 
it will be convenient to conclude the narrative of the course

ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF DISSENT. 157 

of dissent which, almost unintelligible to foreigners, and even 
to Englishmen, is a vital element in the history of Fife and 
Scotland nearly down to the present time. The deepest and 
the most enduring tendencies of the Scottish character are 
towards toleration, union, peace in religious as well as civil 
affairs. But contrary currents have seldom been altogether 
absent, and at times appear predominant, which set towards 
dissent, division, and self-assertion. The strength which an 
English historian regards as the national characteristic of 
Scotland has shown itself also here, so it is not wonderful 
that some have mistaken the currents for the main stream. 

The Union, by transferring Parliament to London, centred 
the Scottish mind on questions of religious doctrine and 
Church government in preference to, and for a time almost 
to the exclusion of, questions of secular politics and the 
government of the State. It was naturally inclined in this 
direction. But in the earlier struggles of the Reformation 
and the Covenant civil and religious freedom had been a 
common cause. They were now severed. The Scots had 
never, with few exceptions, been Republican. Presbyterians 
and Episcopalians alike accepted Monarchy. But the former 
accepted it on the condition of the independence of the 
Church, and this independence was deemed in danger not 
merely by the express adoption of the Royal supremacy by 
the English Church, but by the modified form in which it 
was engrafted on the Presbyterian Establishment in Scotland, 
and the restoration of Patronage by an Act of Queen Anne. 

This deadly heresy, as it was deemed, was called Erastian- 
ism, and was the root of all the Secessions. The doctrine of 
the Headship of Christ, which meant to practical politicians 
that of the rulers of the Church under the scheme of Presby- 
teries, Synods, and Assemblies, and the mode of electing these 
rulers by the choice of the congregation and not by any

IS8 THE MOTHER COUNTRY OF SECEDERS. 

system of patronage, were the main points of controversy. 
Denunciation of Papacy, of Prelacy, of tests imposed by 
authority other than the Church, of interference, however 
slight, with religious worship, were results of the acceptance 
or interpretation of the fundamental principles. These prin- 
ciples were asserted to be the original principles of the Scottish 
Reformed Church, and each successive Secession claimed that 
it alone maintained them in their integrity, and that their body 
alone was the true Chorch. The Reformed Presbyterians, the 
successors of the Cameronians, could claim, in addition, that 
they had never departed from the Covenant. This explana- 
tion is needed to follow the history of the Secessions, which 
found adherents in all parts of Scotland, but nowhere more 
strenuous supporters than in Fife. 

The district between Perth and Stirling, and especially the 
western district of Fife and Kinross, including Abemethy, 
Dunfermline, Kinross, Portmoak, Orwell, Inverkeithing, Falk- 
land, and Burntisland, has been called the mother-country of 
the Seceders, though several of the ministers who were their 
leaders were bom in other districts, and the Secession became 
at a later period more powerful in the west than the east. It 
is perhaps not far-fetched to trace its origin to the seed sown 
by the Protesters of the preceding generation, in the days of 
the Commonwealth and Charles II., and by the field-preachers 
who, in the conventicles of the Lomonds and the Ochils, con- 
verted Hackston of Rathillet and Cameron of Falkland. One 
of the early churches of the Secession was placed at Rathillet, 
a small hamlet in the parish of Kilmany, and another at Falk- 
land. " The same spirit that assembled the Covenanters at 
Loudon Hill draws together the Seceders of this day," wrote 
an eye-witness in 1776, "annually to the Muckle Ben, a hill 
near Abemethy, generally in June and July, when the labours 
of the spring are over, and those of the harvest have not

commenced." The Seceders claimed direct descent from the 
Protesters, and near kinship with the English Puritans. They 
disowned connection with the Cameronians, but amongst their 
original numbers were some who shared Cameronian views. 
This extreme party afterwards seceded from the ranks of the 
first Seceders when they had exchanged the principle of the 
Covenant, to which the King was a party, for the voluntary 
principle of a complete separation between Church and State, 
combined with a contention for disestablishment by political 
action instead of revolutionary methods. 

It was in the half-pastoral, half-agricultural parish of Port- 
moak, on the shore of Lochleven, under the shadow of the 
Bishop's Hill, one of the Lomonds, that Ebenezer Erskine 
passed his early manhood as its minister, and adopted the 
principles which led to the first or Original Secession. His 
father, minister of Cornhill in Berwickshire during the Killing 
Times, refused the Indulgence, lost his charge, and narrowly 
escaped imprisonment in the Bass. A tutorship in the Rothes 
family, followed by his presentation in 1703 to the parish 
of Portmoak, brought Erskine to Fife. The yoke of patron- 
age prevented his translation to Burntisland in 171 2, to 
Kirkcaldy in 1724, and to Tulliallan in the following year. 
He remained in Portmoak till he was at last successful 
in obtaining a settlement in the West Kirk of Stirling 
in 1 731. While at Portmoak he had refused to take the 
oath of Abjuration in 171 2, and had embraced the Puritan 
views of the modified Calvinism of * The Marrow of Modern 
Divinity,' which had passed into Scotland partly through 
the medium of Boston's 'Fourfold State.' He was one of 
the twelve apostles or Marrow men who protested against 
its condemnation by the Assembly of 1720. With Boston 
he was alarmed at the progress of rationalist and Arminian 
opposition to Calvinistic doctrine by Simpson the Glasgow

and Campbell the St Andrews professor. Such teaching 
was thought to lead to Socinianism. The slight censure 
the professors received from the Moderate party, who formed 
a majority of the Assembly, and the obstacles placed in the 
way of popular elections in the Church, confirmed him in 
the dissenting and protesting vein he had inherited with 
the blood of his Covenanting ancestry. 

But like all men who have influenced their fellows in 
matters of religion, there was an inward spiritual call as well 
as an external political side to the character of Ebenezer 
Erskine. A conversation on religion between his brother 
Ralph, minister of Dunfermline, the hymn -writer of the 
Secession, and his wife, which he overheard, was the occa- 
sion of his conversion to a deeper sense of sin and need of 
a Saviour. From that time his preaching was the fervid 
utterance of personal conviction. Through the cloudy and 
sometimes trivial controversies in which he engaged, and the 
tedious mannerism of the later Calvinistic pulpit, his piety 
shone like a guiding star. His preaching had little of the 
oratorical art, but his sermons affected his hearers at times 
to tears. They were aided by a dignity of person and grace 
of manner. " The Gospel in its Majesty " was the descrip- 
tion more than one hearer gave of his preaching. The 
Occasion, or week of tent-preaching ending with the Action 
sermon immediately before dispensing the Lord's Supper in 
the open air, was then common in Scotland. It still lingers 
in the Highlands as a survival of the times when there were 
either no churches, or only churches it was deemed wrong to 
enter. It was frequented on the hillside at Portmoak by as 
many as two thousand. Some walked sixty miles to attend. 
One self-taught country schoolmaster attracted by Erskine's 
preaching was John Brown, a herd-boy at Carpow, near 
Abernethy, afterwards the commentator of the Self-inter-

ERSKINE APPEALS TO DEMOCRACY. l6l 

preting Bible, and minister of Haddington, the father of a 
line of eminent Dissenters, — for the principles of the Seceders, 
not lightly embraced, have descended through at least three 
generations. 

The year after he went to Stirling, Erskine preached as 
Moderator of the Synod at Perth from the text, " The stone 
which the builders rejected is become the head stone of the 
corner." An Act had been passed giving the heritors and 
elders power to elect and call, not merely to name and pro- 
pose, ministers ; and the pith of Erskine's discourse is in the 
following sentence : " I shall say less of the Act now that 
I had opportunity to express myself before the National 
Assembly when it was passed; only allow me to say this, 
that whatever Church authority may be to that Act, yet it 
wants the authority of the Son of God. And seeing the 
Reverend Synod has put me in this place where I am in 
Christ's stead, I must be allowed to say of the Act what I 
apprehend Christ Himself would say of it were He personally 
where I am, and that is that by this Act the comer-stone 
is rejected. He is rejected by His poor members, and the 
rich of this world put in His room." It was a bold claim, 
made with simple sincerity, yet not without pride. We hear 
once more an echo of Knox, in language less vehement and 
rugged, yet with some of the same penetrating and per- 
suasive force. It is the voice of the religious leader appealing 
to the religious democracy of Scotland 

On this sermon quickly followed the events which led to 
the Secession. Erskine, censured by the Synod, appealed to 
the Assembly, which sustained the Synod's action. On 14th 
May 1733 he was called to the bar and solemnly rebuked by 
the Moderator, who refused to allow him to read a protest 
he had prepared. It fell into the hands of a member, who 
called the attention of the Assembly to it at the evening

sederunt, and at 1 1 p.m. an officer cited him and three other 
ministers who had concurred in the protest to appear next 
morning. Remitted to a Committee, who dealt with them in 
the vain hope of a retractation, they were handed over to the 
Commission of the Assembly, which on nth November de- 
posed them by a casting vote. On the same day Ebenezer 
Erskine, William Wilson of Perth, Alexander Moncrieff of 
Abernethy, and James Fisher of Kinclaven signed an Act 
of Secession at a meeting in a small house at Gairney- 
bridge on the road from Dunfermline to Kinross. A 
monument now marks the spot where they drew up their 
extra-judicial testimony. On 6th December they formed 
themselves into an Associate Presbytery, with Erskine as 
Moderator. 

Alarmed at the support which the four ministers, the 
Fathers of the Secession Church, received, the Assembly of 
1734 drew back and offered to reinstate them. It was too 
late. Wilson might have come back, but Erskine's stronger 
will prevailed, and on 3d December 1736 they again met 
and revised the Judicial Testimony, afterwards still further 
enlarged in 1742. 

This able but unequal document condemned the sins of 
the Established Church in the past and present, its accept- 
ance of Royal indulgences, its faithlessness to the Covenant, 
its Erastian backsliding, its submission to the civil magistrate 
in matters of doctrine and Church government, its tampering 
with Arminian heresies and tolerance of Episcopal chapels, 
its defect of Scriptural doctrine, and the repeal of the penal 
statutes against witches, contrary to the express letter of the 
law of God, " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The 
country in which they preached had witnessed some of the 
last burnings of witches. Robert Baillie, one of the most 
respected Presbyterian ministers, and Principal of the Uni-

THE SECEDERS AND WITCHCRAFT. 1 63 

versity of Glasgow, mentions that in 1643, "upon the regreat 
of the extraordinar multiplying of witches, above thirty being 
burnt in Fife in a few months, a Committee was appointed 
to think on that sin the way to search and cure it" The 
regret was for the sin of witchcraft, not of bummg. Yet 
an uneasy feeling had begun that burning was not quite 
the right way to cure witchcraft. Fortunately for the Se- 
ceders, they never possessed the power their New England 
brethren had, to enforce in practice a part of their Testimony, 
of which their successors are justly ashamed. The time had 
passed when burning witches could be excused as a common 
error, but the belief in witches died hard and slowly. In 
this century Grizzel Robertson, an adherent of the Auld 
Lichts at Kennoway, would not comb out her hair at certain 
stages of the moon for fear of the witches. Keil's Den, 
near Largo, has not long ceased to be deemed haunted 
ground. Strangest of all, the old and widespread super- 
stitious belief that a fairy changeling, if passed through the 
fire, became again the person the fairies had stolen, which 
led to a recent cruel murder in Tipperary, is described in 
the Fife tale of Tammas Bodkin as still believed but not 
acted on by the old women of Fife in an earlier part of 
this century. The civilisation of Ireland still lags behind 
the civilisation of Britain, but the verdict of manslaughter at 
the Tipperary trial will, it may be hoped, mark a step of its 
advance in the sister country. 

In 1737, Ralph Erskine of Dunfermline and Thomas 
Mair of Or^'ell joined the Seceders, and later, Thomas 
Nairn of Abbotshall and James Thomson of Burntisland, 
who refused to read from the pulpit a proclamation for the 
discovery of the murderers of Porteous, which had been 
enjoined on pain of deprivation. Porteous, the captain of 
the City Guard, or chief constable of those days, had been

l64 ERSKINE DEPOSED. 

lynched by an Edinburgh mob with a rope an Anstruther 
youth, Birrel, is said to have procured, because Porteous had 
guarded the scaffold and fired on the crowd which sought 
to rescue Wilson, who was being hung for the robbery of 
the custom-house at Pittenweem. "Smuggling," says a 
recent historian of the Secession, " was looked on as but 
a venial offence." Robbery was at least an offence which 
no Government could fail to prosecute, and the murder of 
an officer who acted in discharge of his duty, though with 
excess of zeal, could not be overlooked. The point on 
which the Seceding ministers took their stand was against 
reading any Government order by preachers from a pulpit 
during divine service. It was an unwise mode of promulga- 
tion, but a worse than unwise point for a protest in the 
name of God. 

The Assembly continued unwilling to let the Seceders go. 
It was not till 15th May 1740, after fruitless attempts at 
compromise, that Erskine and his friends were finally de- 
posed. Next Sunday he found the doors of his church 
locked, and, gathering a crowd, preached on the Abbey Craig 
in the open air, and continued the practice till a church was 
built towards the end of the same year. They submitted 
without much murmuring to the loss of churches and of 
stipends. Their successors claim for them that they were 
" martyrs without the solemnities of the stake," but there 
is little of this tone in their own language, which is rather 
that of triumph at deliverance from bondage. The out-of- 
door preaching of the early days of the Secession was another 
link which united the Seceders with the conventicles of the 
Covenanters. As those who have listened to sermons in 
the open air know, it gives a robust, direct, and strenuous 
note to preaching, which is absent from more formal sermons 
preached from the comfortable pulpit to the sitters in the

SECESSION POPULAR IN SMALL BURGHS. 1 65 

somnolent and almost luxurious seats of a heated modern 
city church. 

The Secession was popular, especially in the small burghs. 
In 1765 it numbered 100,000 adherents, with 120 churches. 
But it carried in its bosom the seed of division. It asserted 
the right of a minority, however small, to form a separate 
Church on what they deemed principles the more vital 
because a majority would not accept them. The next years 
of the history of the Secession are not regarded with satis- 
faction even by its most devoted followers. In 1741 the 
leaders quarrelled with the evangelical English revivalist Whit- 
field, because he preached in the parish church at Dunferm- 
line, as well as in their churches, where alone, they said, 
"God's people" were. Whitfield's reply, that he wished 
to preach to the " devil's people," like that of Cromwell to 
the Covenanters, was made to deaf ears. The question 
whether the burgess oath, which required only a pledge to 
support the true religion as presently professed in this king- 
dom and authorised by the laws thereof, without further 
defining it, and to oppose Papacy, might lawfully be taken, 
split in 1746 the Associate Presbytery into Burghers, more 
numerous north of the Tay, and Antiburghers, chiefly found 
south of that river. In 1748 the Antiburgher Synod, of 
which Adam Gib of Edinburgh, called by his opponents 
Pope Gib, was founder, deposed Ebenezer Erskine and ten 
other ministers. Mr Nairn, the minister of Abbotshall near 
Kirkcaldy, separated from his brethren on grounds similar to 
those held by the Cameronians. Towards the end of the 
eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century both 
the Burgher and Antiburgher Synods split into Old Lights 
and New, the latter supporting a revision of the terms of 
testimony, and a more emphatic assertion of the Voluntary 
principle, which the former repudiated.

l66 . GILLESPIE AND THE RELIEF CHURCH. 

A separate Secession, called the Relief, also of Fife origin, 
had taken place in 1752, when Thomas Gillespie, minister 
of Carnock, near Dunfermline, and others, were deposed 
for refusing to obey the orders of the Assembly as to 
the admission of an obnoxious presentee to the parish of 
Inverkeithing. 

The political principles of the Seceders were somewhat 
modified, and the opposition which they might have met 
with from the Government was averted, by the stand they 
took against any external rebellion or revolution. In the 
'45, Ebenezer Erskine mounted guard at Stirling against the 
Pretender, and received the special thanks of the Duke 
of Cumberland. John Brown served in the Castle of Edin- 
burgh. Adam Gib took a prominent part on the same side. 
When towards the close of the century the doctrines of the 
French Revolution spread to Scotland, Robert Shirra, the 
eloquent and eccentric Secession minister of Kirkcaldy, who 
had been bred in Erskine's church, preached a quaint sermon 
against equality, which, he said, with many pithy illustrations, 
he had found nowhere " in the course of his travels on earth, 
in heaven, or in hell " ; and he challenged any of his hearers 
who had met with it in their travels to tell where they had 
found it. It was the same minister who, kneeling with his 
fisher-flock on the sands, prayed for wind to drive back Paul 
Jones, the last pirate in the Forth. The Seceders somewhat 
relaxed in strictness after the deaths of the original Fathers 
of the Secession. Matthew, a son of Alexander Moncrieff, 
who was Laird of Culfargie as well as Secession minister 
at Abernethy, scandalised his flock by chasing a hare on 
the Sabbath, and some of the brethren when he was men- 
tioned would say, shaking their heads, " Ay, he^s a man that 
would gar anybody like him ; but, oh that beast I " while others, 
less strait-laced, would rejoin, " Hoot, he's no' a wrang man

for a! the beasts " It became a proverb," says the Rev. 
James Hall, writing in 1803, "in all the middle parts of 
Scotland, and is so at this day, speaking of any one who, 
though subject to some failing, is a good sort of person on 
the whole, they say, * He's nd a wrang man for a' the beast,' " 
It was a proverb too far-fetched to live, and probably died out 
before the last of the strict Seceders. 

Soon after the commencement of this century the dis- 
senting spirit spent its force, and the spirit of union began 
to operate. In 1820 the New Light Burghers and New 
Light Antiburghers united; in 1842 the Old Light Burghers 
and Antiburghers united under the name of the Original 
Seceders; and in 1847 the Relief and the Secession joined 
hands, forming the United Presbyterian Church, — " a name," 
says the historian of the Relief, "to be remembered in all 
generations." In 1839 a party of the Old Light Burghers 
had returned to the Established Church, and in 1852 a 
section of the Original Seceders joined the Free Church. 

Even this brief outline has carried us beyond Fife ; but 
in the little burghs of the county during last century and 
the beginning of this, no questions were more keenly debated 
than the grounds for separation, and afterwards of union, 
of these various religious bodies. Between 1731 and 1891 
they produced a voluminous controversial literature. One 
thousand and fifty separate books, and eleven hundred and 
fifty pamphlets, on the principles and conflicts of the Se- 
ceders were recently offered for sale, but with difficulty 
found a purchaser. The tradition of Calvinism, handed 
down through a succession of generations taught the Shorter 
Catechism in youth, listening Sabbath after Sabbath to the 
same theology from the pulpit, and engaging in ecclesiastical 
debates through the week, formed much of the intellectual 
and spiritual nutriment of a large portion of the population

in the towns. " The region between the Tay and the Forth,' 
writes Hall, " is the hottest quarter of religious zeal and con- 
troversy in Scotland." Sir David Lyndsay's works and the 
old ballads once so popular were driven out of the cottages 
by Boston's * Fourfold State,' Gib's ' Display of the Secession 
Testimony,' and the martyrology of the Covenanters in 
Howie's * Scots Worthies.' In the rural districts the Estab- 
lished Presbyterian Church more successfully maintained itself 
amongst the farmers and some of the labourers, while many 
of the larger landowners remained or became adherents of 
Episcopacy. Romanism was almost extinct. 

In politics there was little room for independent action 
till the Parliamentary and Municipal Reform Acts. The 
representation of the county gave rise to occasional and 
bitter contests; but they were conducted almost wholly by 
party managers. A gentleman not very long dead exercised,* 
as delegate, a sixth part of the parliamentary representation 
of the burghs of Fife. The municipal government was 
carried on in a manner described in the line, " The Provost 
was perpetual, and drove the whole machine." Sir Peter 
Halkett, head of the family of Pitfirran, was Provost of Dun- 
fermline for twenty-seven years in succession. The indepen- 
dence of the Scottish character, of which Fife, like Aberdeen, 
was a conspicuous sample, manifested itself almost entirely in 
ecclesiastical affairs. In the middle of the present century, to 
conclude this rapid sketch of ecclesiastical history, the wider, 
though not originally deeper, Secession of the Free Church 
set up a separate and rival minister in almost every parish in 
Fife, for which the new name of the Disruption was invented 
and came into popular use. The question of patronage was 
again the occasion of the Secession ; but the doctrine of the 
Headship of Christ, and opposition to the Moderate views 
held by many who remained in the Established Church, in-

fluenced the movement, and gave it a continued life after 
patronage had been abolished in 1878. The original leaders 
of the Disruption strongly asserted the duty of the State to 
support the Church, and repudiated the Voluntary principle 
of the earlier Secessions which implied the separation of 
Church and State ; and although the succeeding generations 
have more and more moved in that direction, the attempt 
to unite the United Presbyterian with the Free Church in a 
still larger union of Presbyterian Dissenters has been as yet 
unsuccessful, though some in all the Churches have begun to 
nourish the hope of a wider Presbyterian union, a few even 
of a union of Christians. The Disruption found in Fife its 
greatest leader, Thomas Chalmers, who never lost the accent 
of Fife in his speech, and represented some of the best 
elements of the Fife character. What it is necessary to say 
of a movement so recent, and yet which now seems so 
distant, as the Disruption, will be better deferred till his life 
comes into view. 

It was reserved for two other ministers, one of Fife descent 
and the other connected with the county by residence and 
marriage, to complete the full circle of dissent from the Pres- 
byterian Established Church. The one lived in the first part 
of last and the other in the first part of the present century. 
With little else in common, both John Glas and Edward 
Irving shared the tendency of religious enthusiasm to found 
new Churches. Both were counted extravagant by the mem- 
bers of the more numerous Churches ; but a certain measure 
of sobriety may be noted even in their extravagances. 

Glas, a son of the minister of Auchtermuchty, in which 
parish he was born in 1695, was educated at the University 
of St Andrews, but did not live much in Fife. It was when 
minister of Tealing, in Forfarshire, in 1729, that he announced 
the peculiar views which led to his deposition. He repudiated

the Covenant, the corner-stone of other Scottish sects, and 
drew a sharp line of demarcation between the Old and the 
New Testament Dispensation. While, like the Seceders, he 
disowned the authority of the State in all matters ecclesias- 
tical, he did not assert the authority of the Church in matters 
temporal, or in the debatable ground bet^^een the spiritual 
and temporal provinces. He regarded the true believers as a 
purely spiritual community, living apart from the world, and 
practising literally some of the precepts of the New Testament 
Scriptures. It was a movement founded, like that of the 
Quakers and other sects, on a literal interpretation of parti- 
cular passages of Scripture ; but such sects have either not 
chosen the same texts or given the same texts a different 
interpretation. Glas revived the common meals of the early 
Church as the true form of the Communion, practised in the 
primitive Church, and the kiss of peace as a direct injunction 
of the Apostles. The Bible, he said, " was never intended to 
teach philosophy." The Church of " The King of Martyrs " 
was not of this world. His toleration of others went so far as 
to say, when informed of the execution of his son's murderers, 
" It would be a glorious instance of divine mercy if George 
Glas and his murderers should meet in heaven." How dif- 
ferent from the spirit which excommunicated from their 
Church those who differed from it even on minute points, 
called themselves God's people, deemed members of other 
Churches the devil's people, and had neither charity nor 
hope for the Romanist, any more than some Romanists 
have for the Protestant 

It is an unfortunate feature of ecclesiastical history, not 
in Scotland alone, that intolerant opinions have in general 
more power of propagation than tolerant The Glassites, or 
Sandemanians, one of the smallest of denominations, have at 
least proved their own tenet that they do not belong to this

world. Perth, to which Glas's son-in-law Sandeman belonged, 
was the centre of an almost family sect ; but one or two con- 
gregations at one time existed and perhaps still maintain an 
obscure existence in Fife. A sect of similar tenets, though 
even more limited in numbers, the Bereans, founded by John 
Barclay of Muthil, in Perthshire, had a congregation at New- 
burgh, in Fife, of which Mr Alexander Pirie, after passing 
through the sects of Burghers, Antiburghers, and the Relief, 
became the minister. The Glassites were not too small a 
sect to have a secession of their own, which was led by 
James Morrison, a son of a bookseller and postmaster in 
Perth. He must not be confounded with another James 
Morrison, son of a Secession minister, the founder of the 
Evangelical Union or Universalist Church. 

Edward Irving was, like Ebenezer Erskine, of Border 
origin, but came when a young man in 181 2 to Kirkcaldy as 
a schoolmaster, where he lived for seven years, fell in love 
with and married the daughter of Martin, the parish minister 
of Abbotshall, and afterwards became the assistant of Chal- 
mers in Glasgow. His eloquence, earnestness, and high ideal 
aims had become known at Kirkcaldy, where it was remem- 
bered that he took his pupils to the sands to watch the stars. 
But he did not discover the new interpretation of Scripture 
nor the gift of tongues till he went to London. The only 
incident of his later history connected with Fife was a sad 
accident by the fall of the gallery when he preached at Kirk- 
caldy. 

The Catholic and Apostolic Church was founded in London 
as a consequence of or offshoot from his later preaching, after 
his deposition from the office of minister of the Scottish 
National Presbyterian Church. It was a return from the idea 
of a national to that of a universal Church ; from the simplic- 
ity of Presbyterian worship to a new and less ornate ritualism

than the Roman, and from Calvinistic doctrine to a system 
chiefly based on a new interpretation of the prophetical books 
of the Old Testament and a few texts in the Acts and Epistles 
of the Apostles, and the Revelation of St John. In its con- 
stitution it aimed at establishing a hierarchy without the 
dangers of Papacy or Prelacy upon a scheme supposed to be 
copied from the constitution of the Apostolic Church. It ob- 
tained few members in Scotland, and probably scarcely any in 
Fife. The wife of Irving was almost his only permanent Fife 
disciple. The relation of the Church which was founded by 
the impulse of his genius, though it prudently refused to bear 
his name, to the history of Fife is negative, indicating that 
there was at least one form of dissent which the natives of 
that county were not prepared to adopt. But neither a land- 
scape nor a historical picture is complete which does not 
suggest what lies beyond its limits.

Good fortune brought to Fife during last century three travel- 
lers of different characters, but all possessing good powers of 
observation, whose descriptions trace its external features with 
faithful accuracy. Its natives may through their descriptions 
see themselves as others saw them, and the student of their 
history should not neglect this valuable aid. Daniel Defoe 
passed through it shortly before, and wrote an account of 
his travels shortly after, the Union ; Richard Pococke, Bishop 
of Meath, visited it in 1760; and Dr Samuel Johnson in 
1773, when the memory of the Jacobite risings was still 
fresh: The residence of Thomas Carlyle as a schoolmaster 
in Kirkcaldy enables us to complete the picture by a view

drawn in the beginning of the century when the county was 
beginning to enter on a new career of prosperity. 

Defoe crossed at Queensferry into the county, which, he 
says, was called of old Caledonia — an error, for the Caledonian 
Wood was north of the Tay. He came first to Inverkeithing, 
an ancient "walled town still populous though greatly de- 
cayed " ; but in Dunfermline he noticed " the full perfection 
of decay — its decayed monastery, palace, and town, the natural 
consequence of the decay of the palace." Still, " the people 
would be poorer if they had not the manufacture of linen — 
the damask and better sort being carried on here and in the 
neighbouring towns with more hands than ordinary." He 
visited Lord Morton's house at Aberdour, the mansion of 
Kinross, and the ruins of Falkland. At Falkland he was 
struck, as an English traveller, with the fine palace of the 
Scottish kings, who had possessed, he remarks, more palaces 
than the Kings of England. At Kinross he saw the loch 
famed for its fish, and the castle where Mary was imprisoned, 
and from which she escaped, he " was not sure whether with 
or without a silver key." The older history of Scotland was 
not Defoe's strong point. He admired Sir William Bruce's 
plantations and the new house of Kinross, which is "all 
beauty," and applies to it Dryden's lines — 

** Strong Doric columns form the base, 

Corinthian fills the upper space ; 
So all below is strength and all above is grace.'* 

Leslie, the seat of the E^rl of Rothes, to which he next 
went, was the work of the same architect. Its magnificent 
interior and fine gallery of pictures, and, above all, the park 
of six miles in area, he thought superior to its site. It was 
the glory of the place and of the whole province of Fife. 

From Leslie he passed to Burntisland, noting, as Cromwell

DECAY OF BURGHS. 1 75 

had done, its good harbour, though he thought more of its 
commercial than its military advantages, — " for what," he asks, 
" is the best harbour in the world without ships, and whence 
should ships be expected without a commerce to employ 
them ? " He adds that there was in Burntisland, as along all 
the coast of Fife, a manufacture of linen, and " especially for 
green cloth, which is in great demand in England for the 
printing trade, in the room of calicoes, which have been for 
some years prohibited." Kinghorn was supported by the 
manufacture of thread, which employed the wives while the 
men went to sea. Kirkcaldy was a larger town of one street 
a mile long, with some considerable com merchants and traders 
with England, as well as shipyards and saltpans. It was one 
of four royal burghs within five miles, and there were eight 
more in the county. Dysart, though one of them, was dying 
but for its salt-work and a few nailers. It is curious that the 
collieries escaped his notice. 

This decline of all the towns he attributes to the removal 
of the Court and nobility to England. The Union had in- 
creased the commerce of western harbours like Glasgow and 
Irvine, and the southern burgh of Dumfries, but all the sea- 
ports on the east coast had lost theirs from the same cause ; 
yet he adds in his hopeful strain what proved a true prophecy : 
" Scotland has a plentiful product for exportation, and were 
the issue of that product returned and consumed at home it 
must necessarily grow rich." He proves this point by a 
detailed list of its exports and imports before the Union, 
remarking that the latter do not equal the lead, coal, and 
salt exported, so that the balance stands greatly to the credit 
of Scotland. " Is it not a pity," he wisely queries, " that her 
own nobility should not, like true patriots, lend a helping 
hand to the rising advantages of their own country? Why 
might not, for instance, the" wool sent to England be spun

into yarn in Scotland? — a manufacture at which the Scots 
are very handy." 

He next runs over the other coast towns — Wemyss, with its 
castle; Buckhaven, with its fishermen, whose clownishness 
gave rise to the byword of the College of Buckhaven, but 
" with scarcely a poor man in it " ; Elie, a little town, but a 
good harbour ; and the Leven, which " bred the best salmon 
in Scotland," and was a good port for the export of coal, 
whose workers Drummond had described — 

" Coalhewers nigri girnantes more Divelli ; " 

Crail, Pittenweem, and Anstruther, all royal burghs ; and the 
May with its light, whose keeper was its sole inhabitant Of 
St Andrews, which he calls the metropolis of Scotland, he 
gives a more minute account, tracing its ecclesiastical his- 
tory, and mentioning that of 945 houses 159 were ruinous, 
and that its harbour was so encroached on by the sea that 
it is not likely to be ever restored. The College of St 
Salvator was out of repair, though St Mary's and St Leonard's 
were still in good order, as they have a better revenue. 
From St Andrews he visited Melville and Balgonie, and 
then went to Cupar, the head town of the shire, of which 
Lord Rothes was hereditary sheriff. He afterwards turned 
north to see the ruins of Balmerino, and crossed the Tay 
into Perthshire, from which he made an excursion to Culross, 
a town on the confines of Fife, then famous for its girdle- 
makers and the vicinity of the coal-mines of the Bruces. 
"The plentiful country behind it, and the navigable Forth 
before it, will always," he remarks, " keep something of trade 
alive." 

One eye of the author of the 'Complete Tradesman* 
looked to business, but his other eye was that of the patriot 
who saw in trade the source of national prosperity, and was

always wide awake. Scotland owed to Defoe not merely 
substantial help in the passing of the Union, by the use of 
his indefatigable and prudent pen, which smoothed away 
many obstacles, but also the disclosure of its future advan- 
tages. He had no spark of English jealousy, and sympathised 
with its natives. Almost all the improvements he suggested 
have been effected. 

Our next traveller was an Irish Bishop, whose observing 
power had been quickened by Eastern travel, and whose sym- 
pathy, unlike Defoe's, lay, not with the Presbyterians, but with 
the Episcopal remnant still left in Fife. Pococke, as became 
a bishop, observed chiefly the ecclesiastical antiquities, but he 
noticed also the modem ecclesiastical condition of the county, 
and cast side-glances at its agriculture, trade, and other mat- 
ters. He entered it by crossing the Tay to Newburgh on 29th 
August 1760, and was first struck by the rare round tower of 
Abernethy, which must have recalled the many similar towers 
of Ireland. He heard there of Moncrieff, one of the Seces- 
sion Fathers, who, after his deposition, had formed " a sort of 
university for educating young men for the congregation, about 
twenty of whom boarded with the farmers at two shillings a- 
week." These early frugal colleges of the Seceders, of which 
there was another at Gairneybridge, where John Brown taught, 
as well as in other parts of Scotland, were a marked feature 
in the early history of the Secession. The text -book for 
Philosophy at the College of Abernethy was Locke's * Essay 
on the Human Understanding.* One of the professors, Mr 
Pirie, though he had no education beyond what he got from 
the Seceders, had a controversy on equal terms with Lord 
Kames on the Doctrine of Necessity. The educational in- 
stinct of the Scottish people, even the poorest classes, which 
did not limit education to the three R's, made itself felt in 
this movement. This tendency to culture produced in a

comparatively small Church a historian like Dr M*Crie, a 
lexicographer like Jamieson, and, in a later generation, a 
humorist like Dr John Brown, and preachers like his father, 
Dr John Ker, and Principal Cairns. A minute study of both 
the Old and New Testaments supplied a sufficient vocabulary 
of good plain English ; and the imagination fed on the 
sublime poetry of the Psalms and the splendid visions of 
the Prophets. A peculiar vein of humour, sometimes broad, 
more rarely delicate, but drawn in either case from nature, 
marked the Scottish Seceder. Its greatest master in liter- 
ature hit it off by a word when he describes one of the 
dogs he loved so well as a " Scottish terrier of the U.P. 
persuasion," a rough, shaggy dog, with a twinkle in his eye 
and wag of his tail which we miss in more aristocratic 
breeds. 

Pococke next visited the Cross of Macduff, and saw, he 
thought, the sockets to whose iron rings the heifers had been 
tied, when the old privilege of the clan was claimed, and near 
which three witches had been burnt in 1669. The sockets 
were probably only places in the foundation-stone from which 
nodules of iron pyrites had been removed. In the neigh- 
bouring village of Newburgh, he says, the population was 
occupied either in farming or weaving, and he should have 
added in fishing. The Abbey of Lindores and the shady 
walk of the monks under the trees to the Holy, or perhaps 
Holly Mount from the hollies still standing in the grounds 
of Birkhill, and the den from which Wallace had come to 
the battle of Blackearnside, were also noticed. Visiting, as 
he passed, the ruins of Balmerino, he came to Cupar, a small 
town of about 2000 souls, on the highroad from Dundee to 
Edinburgh, with a good market and a pretty large Nonjuring 
Church. 

From Cupar he went to St Andrews, and admired on the

VISITS ST ANDREWS AND EAST NEUK. 1 79 

way the quiet but picturesque landscape of the castle, church, 
and bridge of Dairsie. He was pleased with the situation of 
St Andrews on the high ground facing the sea, with a small 
brook which "might be of great use in carrying on any 
manufacture," a prognostic since fulfilled by the prosperous 
paper-mill of Guardbridge. Of the ecclesiastical and col- 
legiate buildings he gives a full account, and records the 
repair of the Chapel of St Salvator's, which Defoe had seen 
in a dilapidated state. He was hospitably entertained by the 
professors, and gives a good account of the students, who are 
kept " strict to their studies, and do not attend any diversion 
that will take them off." From St Andrews he went round 
the East Neuk, and visited Crail and its collegiate church, 
Kilrenny, Anstruther, Pittenweem with a declining whale- 
fishing and an infant carpet manufacture, and St Monans, 
with its ancient church, partly honeycombed by the weather 
and unroofed, partly used for the parish kirk of Abercromby. 
The fine curve of the Bay, guarded by the Law of Largo, 
then came in view, and he noted some remains of earthen 
or Picts' houses, which, though still so called, are probably 
the dwelling-places of an earlier race than the Picts. He 
next visited the castles of Balgonie, Kelly, and Lundie, 
and the three Standing-Stones of Largo, perhaps the oldest 
memorial of Fife, which he thought had been part of an 
oblong Druid temple, but they are more likely the monu- 
ments of some fallen warriors. At Leven he saw the rich 
coal-field which stops south of the Eden. From Leven he 
went to Leslie to pay his respects to the Earl of Rothes, 
then Commander-in-Chief of Ireland, and noticed, as Defoe 
had done, its magnificent house, burnt three years after his 
visit, which the Duke had built in the time of Charles IL, 
a rival of Holyrood in splendour, with its fine tapestry and 
picture-gallery of family portraits, and one of Rembrandt,

painted by himself. Passing Melville, where a large house, 
still standing, had been built by Sir William Bruce, he came 
to Falkland, and minutely described the palace; and from 
that to Milnathort, where Mair of Orwell, one of the early 
Seceders, had " a meeting-house for his sect, which abounded 
in these parts." After visiting Lochleven, both the Castle 
Island and St Serf's, he passed the other lakes of the Loch 
Lands — Loch Ore with the castle of the Wardlaws, Loch Fitty, 
and Loch Gelly — remarking by the way the plantations of 
Adam, the architect, at Blairadam. His next stopping-place 
was Kirkcaldy, already spreading to its suburbs Sinclairtown, 
Pathhead, and Linktown, from which he came west along the 
coast by Kinghorn to Queensferry, calling by the way at the 
castle of the Hendersons at Fordel, the old house of Dalgety, 
and the good new house of Donibristle, where he saw, as at 
Leslie, tapestry and fine pictures, including one of Charles I. 
after Naseby, and an elegant chapel for the service of the 
Church of England. From this he passed to Inverkeithing, 
where he failed to see any remains of the Franciscan convent, 
and so to Dunfermline. Of the ruined buildings of royal 
Dunfermline, as of ecclesiastical St Andrews, his description 
is full, and he notes even smaller antiquities, the furniture of 
the palace, already scattered through the town, where pieces 
of it still occasionally are to be met, like the nuptial walnut- 
wood bed Anne of Denmark brought with her, then in the 
inn, now belonging to Lord Elgin. The Seceders again come 
in for a note, though he does not name Ralph Erskine, who 
had died not long before, nor the smallest of all Scotch sects, 
the Glassites or Sandemanians, who had a congregation in 
Dunfermline. The rising manufacturers of "table-linen of 
all kinds, ticking, carpets, and stripped woollen stuffs for 
women," made a thriving town of the abandoned seat of the 
Scots kings.

SAMUEL JOHNSON IN FIFE. l8l 

In Culross and Tulliallan, just beyond the bounds of Fife, 
though again lately reunited with it, he observed the growth 
of the linen industry ; and in Clackmannan Tower he saw 
the sword and helmet of Robert the Bruce. This completed 
his brief survey of Fife, where he spent little more than 
a week. 

Dr Johnson, Fife's next visitor of note, was the most re- 
markable of the three, and though he stayed only at St 
Andrews, and for a few days only, it was enough to raise 
many thoughts in a mind which had the combined power 
of observation and reflection at first sight and at first hand 
more strongly developed than any of his countrymen; The 
Tory Churchman, who had been scarcely out of London, 
had, except the power of observation, little in common with 
the Whig Dissenter, who had travelled before he came to 
Scotland. Yet both were Englishmen to the backbone. 
Much as we may admire Defoe, Johnson will be recognised 
as certainly the more critical and probably the stronger mind. 
Boswell, like a good Scot, boasted as they were crossing the 
ferry to Fife that the view of the Firth of Forth was " after 
Constantinople and Naples, the finest prospect in Europe" 
— ^a remark afterwards repeated by Sir David Wilkie; but 
Johnson drily remarked, "Water is the same everywhere," 
capping it with the verse of Ovid — 

*' Una est injusti oerulea forma maris." 

** Nor groves nor towers the ruthless ocean shows, 
Unvaried still its azure surface flows." 

Byron may have remembered this when he wrote his famous 

line — 

" Time writes no wrinkles on thine azure brow." 

Johnson made puns on Leith and jokes on the barefooted 
Scots ; and when they landed on Inchkeith, which neither

of his companions had before visited, "Had it been near 
London," he remarked, "with what an emulation of price 
a few rocky acres would have been purchased ! " Fortunately 
it has as yet escaped any other inhabitants than the light- 
house-keeper and a few soldiers. The bare rock suits the 
landscape better than if any one had attempted to plant 
a garden with vines and trees as Johnson wished. They 
travelled in a one-horse gig to Cupar over a good road, and 
Johnson observed that in Scotland a man possessing a two- 
horse cart seemed to derive some degree of dignity. On a 
dusky night they reached St Andrews, and, revived by supper, 
Johnson began to rail at Scotch Latinity, which Buchanan 
alone had made famous, and in which he had gained only 
" as great a claim to immortality as modem Latin allows " ; 
but observed that the civil wars had destroyed scholarship in 
Scotland, which appears to be a partial observation, for if so, 
how had it survived in England? A Greek professor, who 
declared that if it had not been for the Solemn League and 
Covenant the Scots would have made as good longs and 
shorts as English scholars, was nearer the mark. 

After supper they walked with a lantern to see St Leonard's 
College. * Dr Watson, the historian of Philip II., had bought 
part of its site when the college had been dissolved, and on a 
visit to him next morning, the talk turned on the relations of 
learning and trade, of patronage and literature, and the de- 
cline of the College of Glasgow as a university since its com- 
merce increased, which Johnson deemed not to be necessary. 
" It is surely not without just reproach," he says, when he 
turned his reflections into a diary, " that a nation of which 
the commerce is hourly extending denies any participation of 
its prosperity to its literary societies, and, while its merchants 
and nobles are raising palaces, suffers its universities to 
moulder into dust," — a reproach since partially, but only

partially, removed. "St Andrews," he continues, "seems 
to be a place eminently adapted to study, ... yet the 
students do not exceed one hundred." 

Boswell happening to ask where John Knox was buried, 
which as a denizen of the Parliament House he should have 
known, Johnson said gruffly, " I hope in the highway ; I have 
been looking at his Deformations." It was a prejudiced 
remark, for the decay of learning and the universities was 
certainly not due to Knox. When sauntering round the 
ruins of the cathedral, they conversed on religious retirement 
and the monastic life, on which the strong memory of John- 
son recalled the lines of Hesiod : — 

** Let youth in deeds, in counsel men engage ; 
Prayer is the proper duty of old age ; " 

but he adds a Christian postscript to the adage of the wise 
heathen, "not that young men should not pray, or old men 
not give counsel, but that every season has its proper duties." 
Mrs Bruce, a poor widow who lived in one of the vaults 
in the Priory garden, now a tool-house, but once a part of the 
prior's house, with no company but a cat, was brought under 
the notice of the travellers, and no doubt received their alms. 
True to her country, where even the poorest are independent, 
she told them her husband's ancestors had lived there for 
four generations, and "though she is now neglected, she 
spins a thread and is troublesome to nobody." They dined 
with the professors, and inquired into the cost of a student's 
life, which they were told was only fifteen pounds for those of 
the higher, and ten for those of the lower rank during a 
seven months' session. An imprudent professor asked John- 
son how he liked his dinner. " I did not come to Fife," he 
grunted, " to get a good dinner, but to see savage men and 
savage manners, and I have not been disappointed." There 
had been at least one savage at that St Andrew's dinner.

184 DECAY OF ST ANDREWS. 

Amongst other sights, they saw a Nonjuring clergyman in his 
full canonicals, which was deemed a proof of toleration ; the 
school of a fencing-master, which Johnson said he would 
have attended had he been a student ; the tomb of Sharp in 
the Town Church ; and the neat chapel of St Salvator's, but 
the key of the Library of that College could not be found. 
Amongst other notables, they met Craig, a nephew of Thom- 
son the poet, and the architect of the New Town of Edin- 
burgh, not then built It would be improper to linger longer 
over the many shrewd observations of Johnson. His con- 
cluding reflection was : " The kindness of the professors did 
not contribute to abate the necessary remembrance of an 
university declining, a college alienated, and a church pro- 
faned and hastening to the ground." The rude candour of 
Johnson at least enabled Scots willing to learn to realise 
the prayer of their poet, more often offered than granted or 
desired, "to see themselves as others see them." 

The decay of St Andrews struck even Scottish observers. 
" It is truly humiliating," wrote Francis Douglas of Abbots 
Inch, who visited it nearly ten years after Johnson, " to see a 
noble street almost without inhabitants terminated by the 
august ruins of a church so long the boast of this city. It 
is supposed that not above an eighth part of it is now in- 
habited. It appears from the account received that there 
were at some times 153 brewers in it; there are but 30 at 
present. There were 53 bakers ; now there are only 4." 

Scarcely more than half a century had passed from John- 
son's visit when a kindred though diverse spirit, Thomas 
Carlyle, came to Kirkcaldy in 18 16, as a schoolmaster. His 
friend Edward Irving was already a teacher in another school 
in the same town. There had been a great change, but Fife 
still retained its old character. The little burghs, scarcely in- 
creased in size, were beginning to revive; Dunfermline was

CARLYLE AT KIRKCALDY. 185 

busy with its looms, Kirkcaldy with its trade, St Andrews was 
once more a seat of active learning as well as of learned 
leisure. If some of the older professors were indolent, younger 
men were attracting the students. Chalmers was lecturing on 
chemistry, and Duncan on mathematics. The pictures which 
Carlyle draws of Kirkcaldy, and there are few better descrip- 
tive artists, are landscapes and portraits, not historical com- 
positions. But as the object of this sketch is to represent all 
aspects of the character of the county, one or two of them may 
be given. He paints vividly the beach of Kirkcaldy in sum- 
mer twilight : " A mile of the smoothest sand, with one long 
wave coming on gently, steadily, and breaking in gradual ex- 
plosion into harmless white, the break of it melodiously rush- 
ing along like a mass of foam, beautifully sounding, and ad- 
vancing from the West Bum to Kirkcaldy harbour." He and 
Irving strolled to Dysart, and to the caves and queer old salt- 
works of Wemyss. Once they made a pilgrimage to Dun- 
fermline to hear Chalmers, and found him " not disappointing," 
a Scottish form of approbation. Carlyle was not a favourable 
judge of any style of eloquence except his own. 

Another day they walked to the top of the Easter Lomond 
to see the trigonometrical survey, and found " five or six tents, 
one a black-stained cooking one, with a heap of coals close by, 
the rest all closed and the occupants gone," busy with the 
useful work which, continued down to our time, has produced 
maps of Fife which would have astonished Scotstarvit and 
Blaeu by their minute accuracy. Yet they are hardly more 
wonderful and are less artistic than those of which Gordon of 
Straloch and Robert Pont sent the drafts to be finished by 
the Dutch artist-engravers of the seventeenth century. Fife, 
to the discredit of the Imperial Government, has not yet 
completed its survey on the larger scale. On their way back 
to Kirkcaldy they saw Falkland, " like a black old bit of coflfin

or protrusive piece of shin-bone striking through the soil of 
the dead past." Its present owner, Lord Bute, has recently, 
by judicious exploration, disinterred some of this dead past, 
and enabled us to see the outline of the older hunting-tower 
of Macduff and the ground-plan of the palace. 

They met in the kirk of Leslie next Sunday "a certain 
tragical Countess of Rothes, who had made a runaway match 
when an orphan at school in London, with a young gardener, 
to the horror of society, and ultimately of herself, I suppose," 
— a strange descendant of the cruel Duke who had lorded it 
over Scotland and Fife in the time of James IL, and of the 
General-in-Chief of Ireland visited by Pococke. 

Like Johnson, but few other of the herd of travellers who 
cross the ferry on the bridge, they made an excursion to Inch- 
keith. They found the whole island "prettily savage," its 
grass mostly "wild and scraggy, but equal to the keep of 
seven cows, still without inhabitants save the lightkeeper and 
his family." No reader of the * Tour to the Hebrides ' had 
taken Johnson's hint of a garden. Instead they saw the graves, 
with rude wooden crosses, of a Russian crew shipwrecked in 
1799. Carlyle saw the first steamer which appeared on the 
Forth about 18 19, the year he left Kirkcaldy. Its rapid 
transit connected Fife with the Lothian mainland in a way 
which astonished the generation accustomed to sloops, but 
has been eclipsed by the great bridge recently opened. 

He compared Kirkcaldy favourably with his native Annan. 
Its population was " a pleasant, honest kind of fellow-mortals, 
something of quietly fruitful, of good old Scotch in their works 
and ways, more vernacular, peaceable, fixed, and almost genial 
in their mode of life, than I had been used to in the Border." 
He was, till lately, remembered in Kirkcaldy by some of the 
boys he flogged, one of whom became its Provost, and con- 
tinued till Carlyle's death to be his friend.

CARLYLE'S OPINIONS OF THE NATIVES, 187 

" I always rather liked the people," he says, " though from 
the distance chiefly, chagrined and discouraged by the trade 
one had;" and he extends his compliment to "the little 
burghs and sea villages, with their poor little havens, salt- 
pans, and weather-beaten bits of cyclopean breakwaters, and 
rude innocent machineries, . . . looms, Baltic trade, and 
whale-fishing, and the flax-mills turned mainly by wind, and 
curious blue-painted wheels with obliqe vans." In two years 
he and Irving had got " tired of schoolmastering and its mean 
contradictions and poor results." He left it for the small 
metropolis of Scotland, and later for the great metropolis 
of England, to find contradictions perhaps not less mean 
and results no richer than those which the same brains 
might have gathered in Fife. 

Irving would, according to Carlyle, have been a happier 
and wiser man had he not dimmed his vision and wrecked 
his health in the glare and heat of the capital. Carlyle's 
vivid self-portraiture in his 'Reminiscences* leaves the im- 
pression that his own character also suffered from contact 
with the political and the fashionable world which he half 
despised. 

Self-conscious power and unconscious ambition are instincts 
too strong even in divines and moralists not to seek their 
own gratification; and this passage of the lives of the two 
young men, who found Fife too narrow a field, indicates 
that, although the period of its greatest depression was over, 
it had not yet recovered sufficiently to attract and retain 
ambitious youth. There was one native of Fife who, when 
he discovered the vanity of the world, exclaimed, "It's a 
weary and wicked world, and I must go back to Bougie," 
but it is not recorded that this moralist returned to his 
birthplace.

Leaving the observations of travellers and visitors, let us note 
the progress of the county in itself, and trace some of its 
causes. The Scottish zeal for religion has often been com- 
bined with zeal for business. "Not slothful in business, 
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord," has been a favourite text. 
There have been few hermits in Scotland since the Culdees. 
Even before the Reformation a large section of the Roman 
Catholic clergy had been active in secular affairs. Shrewd 
farmers, their granges, mills, and brewhouses studded Fife as 
other parts of the Lowlands. Busy gardeners, they intro- 
duced fruits like the pears which still ripen in the orchards of 
Newburgh, planted trees like the hollies at Birkhill and the 
three yews of Forgan, and flowers in gardens which have 
vanished but left their seeds. The Friars' Shot is one of the

best on the Tay as on other rivers ; and the earliest traces of 
systematic sea-fishery in the Forth are connected with the vas- 
sals and tenants of the monasteries. The clergy or clerks were 
the notaries who wrote bonds and wills, and the judges who de- 
clared and dissolved marriages, administered executry estates, 
and appointed guardians to minors who did not fall under 
feudal ward. The bishops and monks were the first accumu- 
lators of wealth, the precursors of modem millionaires. Before 
the Reformation at least one-third of the land was theirs. 

The serfs found freedom, the middle classes employment, 
and the infirm or aged poor a shelter within or near the 
convent walls or on the wide estates of the prelates, until, 
abusing their wealth and opportunities, the successors of the 
benefactors became the oppressors of the people. With the 
Reformation much was altered for the better, some things 
for the worse; but the spirit of industry and improvement 
continued. Fife appears to have been a specially industrious 
part of Scotland, removed from the scenes of civil war, and off 
the line of the predatory Highlander. Its howes and carses, 
watered by the Eden, the Leven, and the Ore, and the sunny 
sides of the Forth and the Tay, were fertile fields, " the fringe 
of gold" of the Royal proverb, so well described by Mr 
Geddie in the * Fringes of Fife.' Even its hills, Largo, 
Kelly, and Norman Laws, Benarty and the Lomonds, and 
the Ochils which bound it on the north, were not wild, but 
smooth pasture for cattle and sheep. The forfeitiu*e of the 
earldom of Fife to the Crown in the reign of James I. pro- 
bably gave its farmers easier rents ; for the Crown and the 
Church were the best landlords, and the earliest introducers 
of feu-farm tenure. It was indeed on the estates of the ancient 
Earls at Falkland, Auchtermuchty, and Lindores after their 
forfeiture to the crown that the experiment was first made by 
James IV. on a large scale of converting the poor labourers

of the ground into feuars. The more thrifty members of this 
class added to their estates, and all clung with tenacity to 
their little freeholds. 

The sea, which surrounds two-thirds of the shire, yielded a 
rich harvest, and the burghs, both in the interior and on 
either side of the Firths, opened many markets. Fife had to 
contend with raw winds and a cold soil, which "gimed all 
winter and grat all summer," but it contended bravely and 
with success. " Ilka blade o' grass keps its ain drap o* dew," 
was one of its hopeful proverbs. It produced more corn 
than any district of equal extent. It supported a larger pro- 
portionate population than any other county except those in 
which Edinburgh and Glasgow are situated. 

The primary industries of man had been followed from 
early times. Its working population was divided into the 
tillers of the soil, the toilers of the sea, and the weavers of 
the loom, to which were added, in the fourteenth century, 
the miners of the black gold which was to become a more 
stable and less speculative source of wealth than the red gold 
and precious stones of other climes. The history of the 
progress of these natural industries, and of the improvement 
of the condition of the labouring class, well deserves fuller 
study than is here possible. Lost sight of in the more stirring 
and glittering scenes of the surface, it is the subsoil of society, 
as of the land, in which the life of a nation has its roots. 

The Augustinian, Benedictine, and Cistercian monks were 
the first agriculturists on a large scale in Fife. The Priory of 
the Canons Regular at St Andrews, with its cells at Loch- 
leven, Portmoak, and Pittenweem ; the Benedictine monas- 
teries at Dunfermline and Lindores ; and the Cistercian 
at Cupar, Balmerino, and Culross, were agricultural centres 
from the western border to the East Neuk, and made and 
tilled the most productive soil, which is generally on the 
margin rather than in the interior of the county.

ADVANCE OF AGRICULTURE AFTER THE UNION. I9I 

Wheat early figures in the rent-roll of these rich founda- 
tions. The runrig acres of their tenants may even now be 
traced in some places, as at Scotlandwell. The great plough, 
worked by twelve or eight oxen, the joint adventure of the 
village, which still often retained the old name of " the toun," 
continued to be used till after the Union. Before the Union 
agricultural progress had commenced, but there was still 
much waste and barren land, little drainage, old-fashioned 
implements and modes of tillage. The Union, with other 
benefits, brought a knowledge of the more advanced methods 
of England, and the Scotch pupils outstripped their masters. 
In 1723, "The Society of the Improvers in the Knowledge 
of Agriculture in Scotland" was instituted; and soon after 
local societies sprang up in different districts in Scotland, 
especially the Lothians and Galloway, Aberdeen and Fife, 
which greatly advanced this branch of industry. 

In 1793, Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster organised the scheme 
for the * Statistical Account of Scotland,' and two years after 
obtained the appointment of a Scottish Board of Agriculture 
and Internal Improvement. At the suggestion of this Board 
surveys were published of the agricultural condition of the 
counties of Scotland, and that of Fife was fortunately intrusted 
to Dr John Thomson, minister of Markinch, a nephew of the 
poet. Drawn up a few years earlier,^ the survey was published 
in 1 800, and presents a clear picture of the agricultural state 
of Fife a century after the Union. He quotes on his title- 
page his uncle's lines : — 

'* Oh, are there not some patriots to whose power 
That best, that godlike luxury is given, 
Of blessing thousands, thousands yet unborn, 
Through late posterity ? Some large of soul 
To cheer dejected industry, to give 
A double harvest to the pining swain, 
And teach the labouring hand the sweets of toil ? 
Yes, there are such."

192 REPORT BY THOMSON OF MARKINCH. 

The work which follows is not imaginative but practical, and 
though the stage of progress which it marks has been dis- 
tanced by the improvements of the present century, it is 
worth while to recall its main features, and the wise remarks 
of the patriotic author. 

Although a practical farmer, Dr Thomson is not a grum- 
bler, but almost an optimist, and he takes the most favour- 
able view of all classes of the county in which he lived. 
But he never misses a chance to point out necessary im- 
provements or the obstacles to successful farming, in the 
modes of tenure, the conditions of leases, and the absence 
of enclosures. " Property in the county of Fife," he writes, 
"is more equally divided, and, in proportion to the value 
and extent, distributed among a greater number of proper- 
ties, than in any other county of Scotland. In Fife a large 
proportion of the estates run between ^^400 and ^^3000 per 
annum. From ^^3000 to ;^6ooo there are only a few ; and 
only one, I believe, amounts to ^^8000. From ^^400 down 
to ;;^3o or ;;^4o per annum there are a great number of 
proprietors who pay cess and rank as heritors, and, although 
of inferior fortunes, are generally men of most respectable 
characters. The extensive distribution of property is attended 
with the happiest effects." The small estates in Fife have 
now been for the most part absorbed, and there are few 
Bonnet Lairds. But Kinross probably still has more small 
landowners than any equal space of Scotland. 

Comparing the valuation in 15 17, when an inquest was 
held by Patrick Lord Lindsay of the Byres as sheriff and 
twenty-four jurors, with the valued rent in 1800, he shows 
it has increased from ;^i347, los. to ;^362,5i4, 7s. 5d. 
Scots — above three times the average of other counties ; the 
real rent he estimates at something under ;;^2 12,000 sterling. 
In 1890 the valuation of the county, though adversely affected

IMPROVEMENT IN FARMS AND HOUSES. I93 

by the agricultural depression, was still more than three 
times the real rent in 1800; so that, so far as money is a 
test of prosperity, there is little reason for taking a pessimistic 
view as to the progress of the county. The increase in value 
was chiefly due to the improvements in agriculture which 
Mr Thomson recommended having been carried out, to the 
growth of manufactures, and to the opening of new markets 
by increased facilities of communication. 

With regard to the number of castles and mansions, he 
remarks : " Few counties in Scotland can boast of so great 
a number as the county of Fife, many of which are un- 
commonly elegant; and the rich and extensive plantations 
and pleasure-grounds with which they are surrounded add 
greatly to the beauty of the county." Without pretending 
to exhaust the list, he gives the names of eighty-eight such 
houses, and specially notes that thirty-nine had either been 
wholly rebuilt or received large additions or repairs within 
the last twenty- four years. This building gave much em- 
ployment ; and the mason as well as the joiner or carpenter 
trades have always been popular. Fife, indeed, may boast 
of their honest, substantial work, as proudly as Carlyle does 
of the houses his father built in Dumfriesshire. If the 
castles have now in many places fallen into decay, and the 
old cottages disappeared, this has been due not to their 
builders* want of skill or care, but to their oi^Tiers* or 
occupiers* negligence. 

Thomson calculates that . not less, probably more, than 
^18,300 had been spent annually, or ^^439, 200 during 
the last twenty-four years prior to 1800, in improvements, 
and says that it was within his knowledge that ^^i 0,000 
had been spent in one country parish in building new houses, 
without taking the houses of any of the great proprietors into 
account, within the last sixteen years.

194 RUINS OF OLD CASTLES. 

When he contemplated the large number of ruined and 
ruinous buildings in Fife, Thomson, after the manner of 
his profession and his time, moralises in a melancholy strain 
which the present age does not care to express, and perhaps 
does not feel. "Ruins so extensive," he says, "in proportion 
to the narrow extent of territory to which they are confined, 
while they give a very high idea of the splendour and opulence 
of this county in former times, and of the dignity, rank, and 
consideration of its proprietors, spread a melancholy gloom 
over the mind, and lead irresistibly to serious reflections. 
The time was when these mouldering fabrics stood firm and 
complete, adorned with all the elegance known in ruder 
times, and many of them inhabited by the first families in 
the kingdom. But these once stately mansions, now un- 
roofed, stripped of their ornaments, and deserted, are moul- 
dering in solitary silence under the ravaging hand of time. 
The powerful, the flourishing, and wealthy masters whom 
they once boasted of are long since gone and forgotten in 
the dust. The names of but a few, and the deeds of still 
fewer, have reached the present times. What they and their 
habitations are now, we and our still less durable dwellings, 
in the revolution of a few ages, must certainly be." His 
moral is addressed to his agricultural readers. " Reputation 
may be more generally and not less honourably acquired by 
the more useful though less splendid labours of rural life. Let 
the spade and the plough engrave names upon your lands, 
and let your memory be perpetuated by substantial and per- 
manent improvements of the soil. With what warmth of 
affection will you be remembered by posterity, when they 
shall be able to say. To the skilful and patriotic industry of 
our ancestors we owe the richness and fertility of our lands ! " 
The increased fertility of Fife, due to the agricultural im- 
provements of the present century, may have been partly due

DESCRIPTION OF SMALL FARM. 1 95 

to these exhortations ; but whether posterity has remembered 
its patriotic ancestors is not certain. 

Even in his own day Thomson was able to note some pro- 
gress. The farmhouses and offices twenty years before he 
wrote had a mean and wretched appearance, the house low 
and smoky, badly lighted, and without separate rooms. The 
office-houses had low and rudely built walls and ponderous 
roofs, — the whole irregularly placed in a square, with the house 
and bam on one side, the stable and byre on the other, and 
the dunghill in the middle receiving and retaining all the rain 
that fell and the refuse which accumulated within the square. 

The establishment of a farm under 100 acres in 1792 is 
thus described by one of its inmates : " It consisted of the 
farmer, his wife, a lad about seventeen, a maid, and a boy — 
to wit, myself. All worked and ate together, and all slept in 
the farmhouse, which consisted of one room and a kitchen. 
... In the morning about eight we breakfasted on oatmeal 
porridge, with churned or skimmed milk, and sometimes 
whey. Butter was scarcely ever used, and though a few 
hens were kept, they and their eggs were uniformly sold. 
The dinner-hour was one, and the fare was always barley- 
broth, with plenty of cabbage or green kail, sometimes a 
little pork or a salt herring being added ; occasionally, when 
there was no pork, a little butter in the broth, beef or mutton 
never being seen in the house. We had bread in abundance, 
— a healthy and substantial mixed bread of oat, pease, and 
barley meal, baked in the house. At night we had again 
porridge, or, in winter, potatoes and milk. On Sundays the 
master and the mistress indulged themselves with a cup of 
tea. I never saw or heard of spirits, wine, or even beer in 
the house. We made our own candles, but were more in- 
debted in the dark nights to the splint-coal. . . . The winter 
evenings were spent in the kitchen, mainly by the light of the

fire. While the women spun, the master knitted stockings, 
the man-servant mended his shoes or stockings, while I usually 
read aloud for the general benefit. Our stock of literature was 
scanty — the Bible, some old sermons, a copy of Boston's 
* Fourfold State,' Hervey's * Meditations among the Tombs,' 
and an ample stock of old stories and ballads, the latter being 
the joint property of the maid and myself. We had family 
worship every evening, the hour of which, as well as of bed- 
time, was a little uncertain, there being no watch or clock 
in the house. When the weather permitted, we regulated 
ourselves by the progress the seven stars made over the peat- 
stack." Harvest was a time of hard work, good pay, and 
mirth on an old Fife farm. The first day was celebrated 
by drinking, according to old custom, "the heuk ale" at 
the nearest public-house, and the last by the supper of " the 
maiden" or " the kirn," so well described in the poem of " The 
First and the Last Day of Hairst," by Alexander Douglas of 
Strath miglo. The beer-barrel or whiskey-keg was broached 
at the close of the barley harvest, and song and dance followed 
to the music of the pipes or the fiddle, or, in lack of these, 
the time was given by " the diddler," of whose talent Hugh 
Haliburton has preserved the memory. Halloween, Hog- 
manay, Hansel Monday, and St Valentine's Eve were also 
cherished festivals of the rustic year. The Foy, or fare- 
well supper before Martinmas, was specially a ploughman's 
feast, as he often changed places at that time. 

When Thomson wrote there were already a good number 
of excellent farm-steadings with houses of two storeys, and 
every necessary convenience for the family ; and the offices 
had been removed to the back, or a little distance from the 
house, and contained stables, cow-house, barn, sheds, store- 
yard for feeding cattle, and milk-house, all built of stone and 
lime, conveniently arranged, and of sufficient size for the farm.

LARGE AND SMALL HOLDINGS. I97 

The cottages had kept pace with the houses of the farmers, 
and were generally better than many of the best farm-houses 
thirty or forty years before ; but in the northern part of the 
county cottages were few, and feuing-ground in small lots not 
common, so that mechanics, tradesmen, and labourers were 
discouraged from settling there. Even through the rest of the 
county cottages were not so numerous as their importance to 
agriculture and the population required. With reference to 
the size of farms, he points out that these, like the estates in 
Fife, varied much in extent, from 50 to 500 acres, on an 
average perhaps 120, but there were also many small holdings 
from 50 down to 8 acres. 

A writer who describes the state of Fife and Kinross 
towards the end of last century remarks : " Every one who 
possessed a piece of land rent free was called a laird and his 
wife in like manner a lady. You might have seen every day 
a lady from the Ochils with butter, cheese, and eggs swung 
over her horse in a pair of creels, and herself mounted with 
grave dignity above the whole, going to market with a stuff 
hood of large dimensions turned up only with silk on her 
head, and a cloak also of woollen, or sometimes, in place of 
this, a riding coat, which was reckoned a piece of finery. . . . 
As to the superior order of lairds, they lived in that easy and 
most enviable state of mediocrity between genteel and fashion- 
able life on the one hand, and poverty and labour or drudgery 
on the other." Yet it was doubted whether subdivision of 
land had not gone too far, and it was observed that with very 
few exceptions the feus were in a worse state of cultivation 
than the farms paying rent. One cause of this had been

198 DIFFUSION OF PROPERTY. 

Farms of 300 acres, says another observer of the same date, 
were not uncommon ; but the great bulk of the land was let 
in much smaller farms of 100 acres and under. The question 
of the best size of farm had been, Thomson states, "much 
agitated," as it still is. He supports the view that there 
should be a mixture of large and small farms, because " there 
is a great diversity among men in respect of abilities and cir- 
cumstances, and also to prevent a dangerous diminution of 
active and experienced hands for carrying on the operations 
of husbandry." He favours, in short, the golden mean. "To 
mince down," he says, " all the land into small holdings would 
neither increase population nor add to the strength of the 
State, and would most probably check the progress of im- 
provement. But to throw the whole estates of the kingdom 
into the hands of a few great farmers might be equally hurtful 
to the progress of agriculture, and would certainly be highly 
impolitic, as it would weaken the support which the constitu- 
tion of the country, as well as public order and tranquillity, 
derive from the general diffusion of property." This diffusion 
of property, he considers, saved Great Britain from the Revolu- 
tion then recent in France, where "the higher orders had 
monopolised all the honours, wealth, and power, while de- 
pendence, servility, and abject poverty had been the portion 
of the lower and by far the most numerous class." He 
praises the character of the Fife farmers. Several of them 
had come from more highly improved parts of the country, 
and contributed not a little by their ability and enterprise to 
the improvement of the county. Still the great body of the 
farmers were descendants of the old stock which had held the 
same farms for several generations, and he commends them 
for decency, sobriety, and integrity. 

Rents varied. In 1792 good land was to be had for 
10 shillings an acre. In consequence of the war with France

it had risen in the best land to a very high rate : J[^2 an acre 
was common, but some large farms were let at ^^3, or, near 
the town, even at ^^4, ;^5, and J[^6 an acre. The absence of 
tithes, so justly complained of in other countries, he thought 
highly favourable to the progress of agriculture. Poor-rates 
were also unknown, and, like the Scotch clergy of his genera- 
tion, he deprecates their introduction, and prefers the old 
Scottish mode of supporting the poor by collections at the 
church doors. He remarks, however, that these chiefly came 
from the pockets of the farmers, tradesmen, and labourers. 
Non-resident proprietors seldom gave anything, and few of 
the residents, many of whom were Episcopalians and attended 
their own chapels, came to the parish kirk, and consequently 
added little to the amount of collections. He approves of 
the Scottish system of leases, generally of nineteen years, but 
in some instances longer, and formerly with a liferent added, 
though this had become rare ; but he argues in favour of re- 
laxing the restrictions which bind the farmer in shackles to 
the end of his lease. 

The implements of husbandry had been much improved 
by the progress of agricultural science. The old Scots 
plough, made entirely of wood with the exception of the 
iron coulter, was almost gone entirely into disuse, and its 
place supplied by a small light plough with an iron head and 
cast-metal mould-board. Harrows of several kinds and rollers 
had come into use. Reaping was still almost invariably done 
by the hook, the scythe being only used where reapers were 
scarce, which was seldom the case in so populous a county. 
Threshing-machines had become common, driven both by 
water- and horse-power, but were still so much of a novelty 
that he deems it worth while to mention one erected at 
Kilrie, in the parish of Kinghorn; another in the parish 
of Leuchars, put up by Mr Buchan, the tenant; and a

third, by Mr Cheape of Rossie, perhaps superior to any 
other in Fife. 

Amongst noted agriculturists in Fife were Sir John An- 
struther and the Earl of Balcarres, who were accounted the 
best farmers in the East Neuk, and would have been reckoned 
the best in all Fife if the palm had not been disputed with 
them by General Skene of Pitlour and Major Law near Falk- 
land. Even a Professor of St Andrews, Dr Wilkie, astonished 
the country people by talking to them in their own language 
and teaching them how to raise turnips and potatoes. The 
example he set was of great use in that part of the countr}% 
and his success was perhaps due to one of his maxims. " I 
never draw any conclusion," he said, " in matters of husbandr}* 
but from direct experiment, and I never reason from analog)'." 
This was a practical application of the inductive philosophy of 
Bacon which Wilkie taught his students as well as the farmers 
of the neighbourhood. 

Enclosures were still much wanted, only a third of the 
county being substantially enclosed, the rest remaining partly 
open or fenced by dikes without hedges, hedges without 
dikes, or by ragged palings. Drainage, as the term is now 
understood, was almost unknown in last century, though 
surface moisture was in some parts carried away by rude 
stone drains. The majority of the ploughmen are praised 
for keeping the ridges straight and of equal breadth from end 
to end, but there were instances of slovenly work, which 
prevented the increase of the quantity and improvement of 
the quality of the produce of the soil. 

Rotation of crops had occupied attention for a number 
of years back, but there was still much to be desired, and 
he gives examples of four-, five-, and six-shift rotation adapted 
to the different qualities of the soil. The crop most gener- 
ally cultivated was oats, oatmeal being still a principal article

GREEN CROPS AND ROTATION. 201 

of food among the lower classes; but the consumption by 
horses was on the increase, so that Dr Johnson's well-known 
sarcasm was probably by this time beginning to lose its 
point. Barley was cultivated to a considerable extent and 
considered a crop of great importance, barley -meal being 
much used, but a still greater quantity was consumed by 
the many breweries and distilleries in the county. Wheat 
during the last twenty or thirty years had become a favourite 
crop, and kept pace with the improvement of the soil, 
but probably its cultivation had been pushed further than 
proper on land not adapted for that crop. Beans and 
peas were cultivated best in the north and south, and pro- 
duced only a scanty crop in the middle and upland parts 
of the county. The potato, although brought over from 
America about two hundred and thirty years before, had 
become an agricultural crop in Fife for only sixty years. 
About 1740, and indeed till 1770 or 1780, it had been 
seen chiefly in gardens, as its value had been little under- 
stood. Even at the date of this survey, only 600 acres were 
under potatoes. Turnips were of recent introduction, very 
few having been grown till 1780; but since then they were 
gradually coming into repute, though not yet so much as the 
nature of the soil would admit. North of the Eden and 
west from Burntisland comparatively few were raised; and 
the cultivation of the Swedish turnip, though attempted, had 
not spread to any considerable extent, but its good qualities 
deserved attention. The cultivation of green crop materially 
altered the conditions of agriculture, and has to some extent 
mitigated the loss from the fall in the price of grain. 

Flax had been encouraged by the Board of Agriculture, 
and the writer, while admitting it to be a scourging crop, 
urges the importance of its cultivation in preference to im- 
portation in a county where the linen manufacture was so

202 ARTIFICIAL GRASSES — PLANTING. 

largely used. At that time about 1500 acres were under 
flax, which was found to thrive well and to be of fine 
quality in the high ground of the middle district On some 
farms part of the wages of farm-servants was paid in flax. 
In the present century the growth of flax has almost dis- 
appeared, and although some attempts have been made to 
reintroduce it in Fife on account of the recent fall in the 
price of wheat, they do not seem as yet to have been suc- 
cessful. The artificial grasses, ryegrass, and red and white 
clover, which were rare some years before, were coming into 
use, and as about one-fifth of the county was inaccessible to 
the plough, the question of improving pasture was of much 
consequence. 

There was nothing in Fife that could properly be called an 
orchard, except the remains of that of the old Abbey of Lin- 
dores, but private gardens were numerous, owing to the great 
number of resident proprietors, and most families in the 
towns and villages had little gardens of their own. There 
was, however, only one market-garden of about twenty acres 
near Kirkcaldy. 

There was little common or waste ground. Several of the 
gentry had been active in planting, especially on the north 
of the county, on the properties of Blairadam, Rankeillor, 
and Craigrothie; and on the south side General Wemyss 
of Wemyss, Sir James Erskine of Cambo, and Mr Ferguson 
of Raith, were noted as great planters. Almost all commons 
had been divided except that of the Lomonds near Falkland. 
A good deal had been done, but not enough for drainage, 
to carry out which it was necessary, as the tenants had not 
sufficient capital, that the landlords should advance the neces- 
sary expenditure and the tenant pay interest at a reasonable 
rate. Useful hints are given with reference to manuring, 
and weeding is strongly urged, for weeds "are robbers that

pilfer the food necessary for the more valuable* and useful 
vegetable." With regard to live stock, he recommends the 
introduction of dairy farming, and the disuse of oxen for 
ploughing. Although there was a difference of opinion 
amongst farmers on the latter point, on the whole the use 
of oxen for draught was decidedly going out, not niore than 
one being employed in the plough or cart for ten so used 
twenty years before. 

The cattle seem still to have been almost exclusively a 
special Fife black breed. But the county has, with a few 
honourable exceptions, — as the polled Angus herd of Miss 
Morison- Duncan at Naughton and the Clydesdale stud of 
Mr Gilmour at Montrave, — not yet acquired a reputation for 
breeding, as Angus has for its polled cattle, and Aberdeen 
for its shorthorns ; nor for dairy farms, as Ayrshire. It has 
confined itself chiefly to importing lean cattle from Ireland 
and other countries, and feeding them for the butcher. A 
great improvement in the quality of horses was marked, to 
which the pastime of hunting, and the popularity of the 
light -horse yeomanry corps amongst the farmers as well as 
the landed proprietors, has contributed. Rabbits were com- 
mon on the sandy links, but not yet bred for profit ; poultry, 
except turkeys and geese, chiefly to be seen about the houses 
of the gentry and large farmers, were largely bred for profit 
and sold in the towns or in Edinburgh. 

The " doocot," or pigeon-house, still so common an object 
in the Fife landscape, was then still more common ; there 
were not fewer than 360, with 36,000 pairs of breeders, 
making dreadful havoc among the grain, of which they were 
supposed to consume between 3000 and 4000 bolls a-year. 
As the profit of each pigeon-house could not be more than 
;^5 a-year, gentlemen were beginning to count the cost, and 
pigeon-houses were suffered to go to ruin. Many of these.

WAGES — A FARM BUDGET. 



now deserted like the castles of their former owners, give 
point to the saying which describes the possessions of a 
Fife laird as consisting of " a puckle land, a lump of debt, a 
doocot, and a law plea." Good specimens of the old dovecot 
yet remaining may be seen at the castle of Newark near 
St Monans, one belonging to the castle of Rosyth near 
Inverkeithing, and a third near Kilrenny. 

A few beehives were found in Fife, when Thomson wrote, 
in every gentleman's garden ; but, whether from want of skill 
or the climate, this was deemed a precarious business and not 
much followed. 

The wages of the ordinary labourer were from is. to is. 6d. 
a-day in summer, and 2d. or 3d. less in winter. Married 
ploughmen had a free house and garden, j£6 to ^^8 of 
money, 6}4 bolls of meal, a cow's grass, and some other 
allowances, making their wage run from j£i6 to ;^i8: the 
unmarried lived in the farmer's family, with ^^8 to ^^12 of 
wages ; women-servants had j£^ to ^4. But on the smaller 
farms much more modest wages were paid, and Mr Ritchie, 
one of the founders of the 'Scotsman' newspaper, who as 
a boy, towards the end of last century, served on a farm of 
90 acres near Largo, gives the following exact and curious 
budget of its expenses, which he says were nearly the total 
expenses of the farm : —

ROADS AND RAILWAYS. 20S 

Harvesting was also an extra, and a larger wage was often 
paid than in this thrifty budget. 

Amongst the obstacles to improvement Thomson reckons 
the roads, which twenty years before were in a very wretched 
state, though something had been done under the Road Acts 
of 1790 and 1797. The county had been divided into four 
districts, Cupar, St Andrews, Kirkcaldy, and Dunfermline, 
and provision had been made for the conversion of statute 
labour, by which the roads had hitherto been kept up, into 
money payments. The erection of toll-bars had been felt 
a grievance, but the writer urges in their defence "that no 
public good is more felt than good roads, and no equal good 
is so cheaply purchased." During the present century good 
quarries and the good management of the road trustees have 
improved the roads at a comparatively moderate cost, so that 
there are few parts of Scotland better provided with this 
means of communication. One of these improved roads 
near Balcarres has been well named after General Briggs of 
Strathairlie, who has used Indian experience for the benefit 
of his native county, as has been done in other parts of 
Scotland. 

A similar praise cannot yet be given to the railways, which 
have been a byword for inconvenient arrangements. It may 
be hoped that the completion of the bridges over the 
Tay and the Forth will be the commencement of a more 
enlightened management. In few counties is railway travel- 
ling more popular, and the great Company which conducts 
it should disdain to take advantage of the absence of com- 
petition. Fife had and has no canal ; and although Dr 
Campbell, minister of Cupar, father of the Chancellor, had 
suggested one from that town to the sea, Thomson doubted 
whether it would pay, and whether any individual or society 
would be so generous as to make it without the prospect of 
being repaid.

206 OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT. 

The chief obstacles to agricultural improvement were, the 
backwardness on the part of the proprietor to spend money 
on it, although "every man of true taste," he says, "will 
enjoy more satisfaction in seeing his fields well cultivated 
than in faring at a luxurious table, and will find more rational 
amusement in the operations of rural industry than at the 
gaming-table or on the turf"; thirlage, by which a farmer 
was bound to send his corn to particular mills, often in- 
convenient as regards situation and exorbitant as regards 
charges ; entails, which prevented leases of sufficient duration 
and expenditure in improvements. But he does not favour 
Lord Kames's suggestion of leases renewable at fixed inter- 
vals, with a revision of the rent at each; and suggests, in 
preference, improving leases for forty-two years. The prin- 
cipal improvements he suggests are "enclosing, planting, 
and draining"; and he also notices the need of better 
cottages and farm-steadings. 

He concludes with a sanguine view of the circumstances 
favourable to agriculture in Fife. The materials for im- 
provement were at hand. There was excellent stone in 
every corner of the county, and a variety of good manures, 
lime and marl, and sea -ware, as well as farmyard dung. 
There was a large population requiring provisions, and 
good fairs and markets, as many as eighty -seven in the 
year, besides weekly markets in the principal towns, of which 
the chief were Cupar and Kirkcaldy. There were also many 
harbours, from the great extent of the sea-coast, both for 
export and coasting trade. The country gentlemen had 
shown excellent examples of improvement ; and he discourses 
eloquently on the reciprocal advantages of agriculture and 
manufactures, which ought to go hand in hand, and are to 
be found in Fife side by side. 

Similar surveys were made about the same time of the

THOMSON SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENTS. 20/ 

different counties of Scotland, but none are more suggestive 
than this of the minister of Markinch, who had much of 
the public and some of the imaginative spirit of his uncle, 
the author of the * Seasons.' The agriculture of all Scotland 
has made a marvellous advance within the present century ; 
and probably it has done so in Fife to as great an extent 
as in any other county. 

By a singular coincidence, Craig, one of the nephews of 
the author 'of the * Seasons,' had recently prepared the plans 
which led to the improvement of Edinburgh by the building 
of the New Town, and another wrote this valuable treatise 
on the agricultural improvement of the county of Fife. 
The greater part of the improvement since made must be 
ascribed to the readiness of the landowners and farmers of 
Fife to profit by discoveries in science and inventions in 
machinery, but a share of it may also be fairly attributed 
to Dr Thomson's Survey, which clearly pointed out the 
advantages of the county and the defects which required 
to be remedied. If farming has often in recent years been 
a losing business, this is not due to neglect of modern im- 
provements but of ancient thrift, which the pressure of 
foreign competition makes more necessar&gt;.

9^ There is no similar report of the manufactures of Fife to 

that of Thomson on its agriculture, and we must resort to 
1' local sources and the researches of antiquaries to give a rapid 

I' narrative of the origin and progress of the industry of the 

;■ loom, the mill, and the factory. It has been the good fortune 

of the eastern shire, as of its northern neighbour Forfarshire 
^ and the western county of Ayr, that they have not had to

\^ distaff, the spinning-wheel, and the loom have been at work, 

f \ used at first in the cottages and small villages, afterwards

Jif themselves the offspring of the increased power of produc- 

tion. The variety of labour and of trade had a direct effect 
upon character, and created, intelligence as well as wealth.

HISTORY OF THE WEAVING TRADE. '209 

The weaver required to use his brains as well as his hands, 
and could not, like the ploughboy, whistle for want of 
thought. An interest in ecclesiastical controversy and in 
politics, not always well informed, but always combative and 
keen, began in this trade long before it had become common 
amongst agricultural labourers or miners. It was the frequent 
practice of the weavers that some one should read aloud in 
the cottage a newspaper or a book even when the shuttle 
was flying across the loom. Bottom, in * Midsummer Night's 
Dream,' was not a Scottish weaver. 

Throughout Scotland in the middle ages the art of spin- 
ning and of cloth -making by weaving and waulking were 
practised. The waulking songs the women chanted as they 
trod their webs, like the boating songs of the men as they 
plied the oar, and the songs the maids sang when they milked 
the kye, taught some of the rhythms of Scottish song. From 
this trade came the common Scottish and Fife surnames of 
Walker, in English Fuller ; Webster, in English Weaver ; and 
Litster (Lister), in English Dyer of the woven cloth. After 
a primitive form of machinery had been substituted for the 
labour of hands and feet, the waulk-mill and the plash-mill 
were introduced, and continued to be used till steam was 
brought into the service of man. 

Fife early adopted flax as one of its agricultural crops, and 
though it is difficult to fix precise dates, the conversion of 
flax into lint was known earlier than the end of the fifteenth 
century, as the lines of Henryson the Dunfermline poet, 
already quoted, prove. More than a century before, in the 
description of the battle of Bannockburn, mention is made 
of the linen of the women and camp-followers on the Gillies' 
Hill, and the towels they bound to the spears and staves. A 
statute of James II. prohibited the adulteration of lint with 
clay. Imagination may even seek to carry back the origin of

the manufacture which was to make Dunfermline famous to 
Queen Margaret and her maidens. They not only worked 
and embroidered ecclesiastical vestments and altar-cloths, but 
also introduced new and more seemly customs at meals, which 
may well have included the use of linen. The queen pur- 
chased from traders beyond the seas "clothing of various 
colours, and adopted new costumes of different fashions, the 
elegance of which made the wearers appear like a new race of 
beings," and may have suggested novel patterns. Still there 
is no clear proof that linen any more than tartan was made in 
the Dunfermline of Queen Margaret. Imported or homespun 
linen as well as woollen was without doubt very early known 
in Scotland, but history dates the introduction of the flourish- 
ing trade at a much later period, and indeed not to any great 
extent till the union of the Crowns. During the reigns of the 
Jameses the finer kinds of woollen broadcloth were imported 
from Holland, and cost ss. to i8s. the ell, and only the com- 
mon homespun, which sold for lod., was of native make. 
But before the union under Anne, Scotland had learnt from 
the chief Continental countries engaged in the linen trade 
what they had to teach, as is proved by the Dutch, German, 
and French names familiar in the trade, — Hollands, Dornick 
from Doornik, Cambric from Cambrai, and Dowlas, Silesians, 
and Osnaburgs from the German districts of these names. 

The Statute-book also affords evidence that the Scottish 
manufacture of linen had increased to an extent which had 
led to exportation ; for the export of linen cloth was forbidden 
in 1573, and of linen yarn in 1661, while its import was highly 
taxed. By an Act in the latter year the export of linen cloth 
was allowed duty free for fifteen years, and this privilege was 
renewed in 1685. Various statutes, from the reign of James 
VI. to that of William III., encouraged the manufacture. 
In 1684 there were already 12,000 persons employed in the

REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION. 211 

linen trade in Scotland. In 1686 the notable Act was passed 
for " Burying in Scots Linen," under heavy penalties against 
infringement; in 1693, another for regulating the manufacture 
so as to make the " trade more acceptable to merchants," by 
stamping the quality of the cloth. The same statute allowed 
the free import of the raw material, lint, flax, and linen yarn, 
and the free export of linen cloth ; but prohibited the export 
of lint or linen yam, in pursuance of the mercantile system. 
Of such legislation, Adam Smith remarked that " it is the in- 
dustry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich that is 
principally encouraged ; that which is carried on for the bene- 
fit of the poor and indigent is. too often either neglected or 
oppressed. By extorting from the Legislature bounties upon 
the exportation of their own linen, high duties upon the 
importation of all foreign linen, and a total prohibition of the 
home consumption of some sorts of French linen, they (the 
manufacturers) endeavour to sell their own goods as dear as 
possible. By encouraging the importation of foreign linen 
yarn, and thereby bringing into competition with that which is 
made by our own poor people, they endeavour to buy the 
work of the poor spinners as cheap as possible." These 
remarks, though made with special reference to the action of 
the English Parliament during the reigns of the Georges, are 
applicable to the legislation of the Scottish Parliament prior to 
the Union. A charter was granted in 1693 to a Linen Cor- 
poration of Leith, and the privilege of free export of cloth 
allowed by it was soon after extended to other places. At 
the Union it was proposed, but not carried, to add a clause to 
the Treaty exempting all Scots linen from duty on export. 

It was the Union and its results which gave the great 
impulse to the Scottish manufacture. Legislation which re- 
pressed manufactures is not a peculiar grievance of Ireland. 
Prior to 1707 the English and Scottish Parliaments passed

212 IMPULSE OF THE UNION. 

retaliatory Acts. The English prohibited the import of Scot- 
tish linen, and the Scots that of English woollen goods. 
Scottish linen was now allowed to be exported free of duty 
both to England and the colonies, and in 1710 upwards of 
1,500,000 yards were produced, a large part for exportation. 
In 1727 the Board of Manufactures was instituted, in partial 
fulfilment of an obligation in the Treaty of Union ; and 
shortly after, in 1746, the British Linen Company, which 
originally united manufacturing with banking, was founded, 
and did not a little to create and support the credit of the 
rising linen trade. One of its branches was at Dunfermline, 
where, according to the Rev. Peter Chalmers, the historian 
of the town, it carried on the manufacture on its own ac- 
count, though the records of the Bank show this was by giving 
credit to the weavers. The system of bounties and premiums 
continued, and was useful in the infancy of the trade. There 
were prizes for growing lint and hemp, for spinning at the 
schools, and to housewives for the best piece of homespun. 
French workmen were brought to Edinburgh to teach the 
preparation of fine cambric, and an Irish weaver was sent 
through the country to give lessons in a business which 
requires the subdivision and adaptation of so many kinds 
of different labour and skill. Some of the schemes of the 
Board were failures or only partially successful, and the 
regulations as to stamping being abolished in 1823, the 
Board has since done little or nothing for the linen manu- 
facture, which had become well able to take care of itself. 
The attempt to introduce this industry into the Highlands 
was one of these failures. Gradually almost the whole trade 
centred in the three counties of Perth, Forfar, and Fife. 

Forfar early took and retained the first, but Fife kept the 
second place. Its soil was specially suited for the cultiva- 
tion of lint in places where it could not grow wheat. There

GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY. 213 

was plenty of water, room for bleaching, and convenient 
harbours for the import of flax or yam and export of cloth, 
A number of small became large villages, almost little towns, 
as Kinross, Milnathort, Newburgh, Auchtermuchty, Leslie, 
Markinch, Falkland, Kingskettle, Strathmiglo, Ladybank, 
Kinghom, Abbotshall, Dysart, Kennoway, and Leven. 
Scarcely a cottage was without its spinning-wheel, scarcely 
a village or town without its looms. The young women 
worked the linen for their first home, the old for their last 
resting-place. Though " the Fife wives were sometimes called 
wasters," an old Scottish lady. Miss Brown of Lanfine, told 
me, " I have seen them spinning with both hands, two threads 
at one time." 

Flax-spinning by machinery only became common towards 
the end of last and beginning of this century. Indeed, ma- 
chinery was introduced for spinning cotton before it was 
applied to flax, as in the large mills of Kirkland, near Largo, 
about 1797, which are now disused. Manufactures, unlike 
agriculture, have a centralising tendency. Even before the 
application of steam to manufacturing machinery, Dunfermline 
and Kirkcaldy had become the centres of the trade in Fife. 
The latter made the commoner kinds of sheeting, checks, 
dowlas, coarse ticks, and sail-cloth ; the former at first huck- 
aback and diaper, and later, chiefly damask for table use. 
Newburgh was famed for its Silesians, Osnaburgs, and brown 
linen. 

It is interesting to note the step-by-step improvement, from 
the damask loom of which James Blake, by pretending to 
be half-witted, learnt the secret at Drumsheugh, then a suburb, 
and now part of the New Town, of Edinburgh, and set up in 
the Pends near the old tower of the Abbey of Dunfermline in 
1 7 18; the adaptation by John Wilson before 1780, which

draw" loom, which gave a pattern to work from instead of 
memory, towards the end of the last century; down to the 
Jacqnard loom, introduced into Fife in 1824, and which came 
into general use in 1830. A curious record of the progress 
of the trade in the beginning of this century is contained 
in the quaint verses written and printed, with rude wood- 
cuts, by D. Paton at Dunfermline in 18 10: — 

** Dunfermline treade it was not great 
when I first in it dwelt, 
Two manufactrers had the most 
if I right recolect 

The tread of this toun did consist 

of domicks cowrse and fine, 
Some deaper also here were wove, 

back-cams were very thin. 

But demask now in all its kinds 

is drove on to great extante, 
From this to London by the sea 

to merchants it is sent. 

From thence it through the world go, 

and serves both east and west ; 
Both Affrica and Indea too 

has there teables with it dres*d. 

Now Manufactrers half a score 

Dunfermline doth contain, 
the weaving treade in less or more 

is caned on by them. 

These men their stock they do not spair, 

but lays it out indeed ; 
By these many one doth live 

by weaving for their bread. 

Some of them that did rise this treade 

at first to any hight, 
Their names into Dunfermline shou'd

KIRKCALDY INTRODUCES THE POWER-LOOM. 21 5 

The poem is put into the mouth of a poetic weaver, and the 
spelling is partly jocular. The metre is that quaint reflex 
rather than parody of the Scriptural paraphrase, the only 
poetic form familiar to that section of the Scottish people 
who did not read 'Blind Harry,' or learn by heart the old 
ballads. Specimens may still be got from all parts of Scot- 
land. Aberdeenshire is particularly rich in them. 

Steam was first employed on a large scale for power-loom 
weaving in London in 1812, but Fife has the credit of making 
the next successful attempt at Kirkcaldy in 182 1, and since 
then its use has been so rapid that the hand-loom, though 
still used for some of the finer work, is almost entirely super- 
seded. In 1880 only 120 hand-looms remained at Dunferm- 
line, and the number has still further declined. In Cupar, 
where in 1836 there were 900 persons employed, and in Ken- 
noway, which had once 400 looms, there is not now a single 
hand-loom. 

Steam necessarily benefited the great factories. The smaller 
weaving villages, like Newburgh and Auchtermuchty, began to 
decay, and the spinning-wheel of the cottage became as anti- 
quated as the distaff, and is now only to be seen in districts of 
Scotland more remote than Fife. In 1869 a single firm, 
Messrs Beveridge &amp; Co. of Dunfermline, employed at St 
Leonard's iioo persons, and made 10,400,000 yards of cloth 
of the value of ;^3oo,ooo a-year ; that of Messrs Dewar &amp; 
Sons employed 500, while there were several lesser manufac- 
turers. In all there were, in 1869, besides the hand-looms 
still surviving, 2670 power-looms at work, giving employment 
to 6000 persons, which produced thirty million square yards 
and a value of about one million pounds a-year, of which 
;^443,879 value was exported to America. Since then the 
value of the produce has not much increased The number 
of hands is still estimated at 6000, and the value of the pro-

duce at something less than a million sterling, of which about 
half goes to America ; but as prices have been reduced about 
25 per cent, the extent of the produce is probably about 
a third greater than in 1869. The stationary number of 
workers may be accounted for by the improved machinery. 
The wages of girls and women vary from 5 s. to 20s. a-week, 
of boys from 4s. to 9s., and of men from i8s. to ^£2, It 
has been the happy and rare fortune of the linen trade, owing 
to the good relations between masters and men, to have been 
almost entirely free from the strikes and lock-outs which have 
so often paralysed other trades, and, resulting certainly in 
present loss, often leave it a doubtful question whether there 
has been any sufficient compensating future gain. 

In Kirkcaldy the linen trade first began after the civil wars 
had ruined their shipping; but little progress was made till 
after the Union, and so late as 1733 the total produce was 
177,740 yards. A wise policy of the magistrates established 
an annual fair, rescinded local customs on linen, encouraged 
bleachers, and even settled a heckler with a salary to teach 
an art which has passed from linen into politics, and is prac- 
tised nowhere more diligently than in Fife. The political 
heckler is often a fool and may become a nuisance, but he 
can prick the windbag and sting the carpet-bagger better than 
a wiser man. The trade now began to grow rapidly, and the 
quantity produced more than doubled in ten years. Though 
checked by the Jacobite rebellion and the American war, it 
still held its ground, and took a new start in the end of the 
last and beginning of the present century. The average pro- 
duced in 1805, 1806, and 1807 was 1,641,403 yards, and in 
181 6, 1 81 7, and 181 8, 2,022,493 yards. In 1838, after 
steam was fairly established, there were iioo looms pro- 
ducing a value of about ;^2oo,ooo. 

In 1883, when the trade was suffering from temporary

MANUFACTURERS AND WORKMEN. 217 

depression, there were fourteen power-loom factories, 2300 
looms, and 2500 hands, making a total produce of the value 
of ;^4io,ooo, of which almost ;;^76,ooo went to America. 
The linen is not the fine linen of Dunfermline, but the 
coarser sorts — ticks, dowlas, checks, and sail-cloth. There 
are also considerable factories in other places, as Leslie and 
Dysart. In Fife, in 1867, 11,500 persons were engaged in 
this branch of industry ; and while this was less than a fourth 
of those in Forfarshire, it was nearly four times as many as in 
Perthshire. 

While there were general causes which produced this 
immense and rapid development of a single trade, and 
many persons to whom the credit of it is due, Mr Erskine 
Beveridge of Dunfermline, and Mr James Fergus of Leslie, 
M.P. for Fife, who introduced the finer ticking for the English 
home trade by the discovery of the open stroke, and Mr 
James Ayton, who has been called the father of the spinning 
trade of Kirkcaldy, are names still remembered with special 
honour by those who have followed the progress of the linen 
trade of Fife. But besides the energy of capitalists, there 
was much ingenuity shown by many known mechanics, like 
Blake and Wilson, and some unknown, like the workman who 
produced at Dunfermline a seamless shirt before the end of the 
seventeenth century. In this as in other trades there was an 
opportunity for advancement, if it was seized by fit talents at 
the lucky moment. One manufacturer, the late Mr Matthew- 
son, who began life as a handloom weaver, employed 900 
hands. Mr Ritchie, whose reminiscences as a farm-boy at 
Largo have aided this attempt to recall Fife in the end of 
last century, left the field for the loom, began to manufacture 
for himself in a small way at Lundin Links, near Largo, and 
migrated to Edinburgh, where he set up as a linen-draper, 
first in Crosscauseway, afterwards in Nicolson Street. As

became a native of Kirkcaldy, the fellow-townsman of Adam 
Smith, he practised as well as preached economy. His 
accumulated savings contributed largely to the start of the 
* Scotsman' newspaper in 1816. His independent, persever- 
ing, and patriotic spirit was conspicuous in its pages, and 
reflected the character of Fife. That Constable and Ritchie, 
two of the chief founders of the periodical cheap press, 
another successful manufacture of Scotland, should have 
come from Fife, was probably more than an accident. It 
was a result in a special field of the industrious and economic 
habits of its natives. 

It is also noticeable that, as in the case of Dunfermline, 
the artistic skill of the designers of patterns, of whom Mr 
Joseph Paton was eminent, has enabled that town to distance 
all competitors, and to hold along with Belfast the market for 
table-linen in America as well as Great Britain. This Ameri- 
can connection led to many young men of the present genera- 
tion seeking their fortune in the great Western Republic, one 
of whom, Mr Carnegie, has been a generous benefactor of his 
native town. Latterly, a considerable part of the business 
energy of Forfarshire has gone over to the manufacture of 
jute, leaving to Fife the production of the finer kinds of 
the superior and more lasting fabric. 

Kirkcaldy affords an example of how much manufactures 
may owe to the ingenuity and enterprise of one man and a 
single generation. There does not appear to be anything in 
its situation or facilities which makes it peculiarly fitted for 
the manufacture of floor-cloth. Linen floor-cloth had indeed 
been one of its products, as in other districts, and possibly 
the whalers, of whom there were several who sailed from 
Kirkcaldy, may have directed attention to the use of oil, 
which had not yet begun to flow from shale or natural springs. 
The late Mr Michael Nairn conceived the idea of making a 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



COLLIERIES FIRST WORKED BY MONKS. 219 

cloth of a more durable material which could receive patterns 
in colour, and supply the place of carpets. He had been 
originally at Bristol, but transferred his works to Fife, where 
they were first known as Nairn's Folly. By using the fibre of 
cork and oil-paint he succeeded in carrying out his idea in 
1847 ; ^"d ^Js firm of Messrs Nairn &amp; Co., followed by those 
of Shepherd, Beveridge, &amp; Co., and Barry, Ostlere, &amp; Co., 
have now associated Kirkcaldy with oil- cloth manufacture 
almost as intimately as Dundee is associated with jute, or 
Dunfermline with damasks. This flourishing business has 
made the "lang toun" longer, and given employment to 
1300 workmen, who turn out annually floor-cloth of the value 
of ;^4oo,ooo. It has as yet no successful rival in this trade. 
Here, too, the readiness of the manufacturer to call the artist 
to his aid deserves recognition. One of the best patterns of 
Kirkcaldy floor-cloth was due to the taste of Mr Owen Jones. 
Really good artistic work, besides its other advantages, is 
generally found to pay in the market. Kirkcaldy has never 
had all its eggs in one basket, and possesses, besides its flax, 
linen, and floor-cloth factories, iron-foundries, a chemical 
work, and bleach -fields, breweries, potteries, and flour-mills. 
It is now seeking, by an improved harbour, to regain the 
shipping trade. 

The Collieries, which now form one of the chief industries 
of Fife, bring us into contact with a different class of the 
population. The county has a scanty supply of the metals, 
but both its eastern and western divisions possess a great 
store of coal, the precious product of the soil which, early 
found so useful as fuel, has increased in utility and value with 
almost every invention or discovery of new mechanical powers 
or instruments. When it was first used in Scotland is un- 
certain ; but one of the earliest notices of it in Scottish 
records is a lease, in 1 291, to the monks of Dunfermline

220 JAMES VI. VISITS CULROSS SUBMARINE MINE. 

by the owner of Pittencrieff, by which he grants "to the 
religious men, the abbot and convent of Dunfermline, a coal- 
pit in the land of Pittencrieff wherever they may wish, ex- 
cluding the arable land, that they may get a sufficiency for 
their own use, but not to sell. Moreover, one failing, they 
may make another according to their free will as often as 
they may see it expedient." The monks of Newbattle began 
to work coal about the same time, and it would appear as if 
the monks were generally the first coalmasters, as they were 
the first agriculturists. When iEneas Silvius, afterwards Pope 
Pius II., visited Scotland in the reign of James I., he de- 
scribes, in one of his lively letters, how "the poor at the 
church doors received for alms pieces of stone, with which 
they went away quite contented, and burnt in place of wood." 
It was a novel sight to an Italian. 

First worked on the surface, where the outcrop revealed 
it and made its working easy, it must soon have become 
necessary, when the surface -coal was exhausted, to sink 
shafts and to drive underground levels. The mine near 
Culross of Sir George Bruce was treated as a great wonder, 
worthy of a royal visitor, when James VI. went there in the 
early part of the seventeenth century ; but probably this was 
from its being worked under the sea, for long before that 
date underground working had been known. The colliers 
had been in feudal times a distinct class or caste, as the 
salters also were, and it was the misfortune of both to be 
treated as bondsmen, or adscripti giebce, who were conveyed 
along with the land long after the gradual, almost imper- 
ceptible, abolition of serfage had made all other labourers free 
men. 

It was not, indeed, till 1775 that an Act was passed by 
which, on a preamble that many colliers, coal-bearers, and 
salters are in a state of slavery or bondage, and are sold

COLLIERS FREED FROM SERFDOM. 221 

with the mines, it was enacted "that no person shall be 
bound to work in them in any way different from common 
labourers," and that "all persons under a given age now 
employed in them be free after a given day"; yet with the 
grudging proviso " that others above the given age were not 
to be free till they had instructed an apprentice." Within 
the memory of men now living, women and young children, 
who had been largely employed in Fife and the east of 
Scotland as carriers, were relieved from a labour for which 
they were unfitted, by one of the Acts which have conferred 
on the late Lord Shaftesbury so enviable a fame. Female 
labour was prohibited, as well as that of children under 
twelve. This was followed by other beneficent legislation, 
providing for the inspection of collieries, the education of 
the children, and regulations for the safety of the lives of 
the miners. A great increase in their wages was the neces- 
sary result of the abolition of serfdom and the growing de- 
mand for coal for industrial purposes ; and if this has also led 
to an increase of price, no one should grudge it who enjoys 
the cheerful fire on the hearth of his own home. The collier 
who, a century ago, received only from 7 s. to 8s. a-week, now 
can earn an average wage of from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. a-day, 
and at times more. Nor can we wonder that the emanci- 
pated miners have formed combinations, and obtained a 
share of parliamentary influence, though the policy of strikes, 
of limitations of output, and of idle days beyond those of 
other labourers, has sometimes been pushed too far, to the 
injury of the miners as well as the coalmaster. Fife has been 
fortunately almost free from the terrible catastrophes which, 
in other districts, now and again appeal to the national con- 
science, and show the risk to which this department of labour 
is subject in spite of the united efforts of science and law 
to prevent it. More still, it may be hoped, may be done to

222 QUARRIES IN FIFE— THE FISHERIES. 

Stamp out the remnants of the truck system, and to give 
additional security to the lives and limbs of those employed. 
To secure the latter, masters and men must co-operate. It 
ought not to be impossible that the industrial war between 
capital and labour should, like the religious wars of our 
forefathers, be superseded by co-operation, mutual toler- 
ation or forbearance, and common counsel for the common 
weal. The future is beyond the scope of the present sketch, 
but the sliding-scale for wages recently adopted in the Dysart 
collieries by agreement between Lord Rossl3m and the miners 
is a good omen. 

Besides the great coal-fields of Dunfermline and Wemyss, 
the discovery of the oil -yielding properties of shale has 
opened a new though fluctuating industry at Burntisland. 
Nor should the quarries of Inverkeithing and of Blair, near 
Culross, and others in the East Neuk, which have been worked 
for export for more than two centuries, be passed without 
notice. A Dutch poet of the first half of the seventeenth 
century, Vondel, sings with poetical hyperbole of the " marble 
cliff of Scotland," which was used to build the town-house of 
Amsterdam. Some of the piers of the Forth Bridge have been 
built from the Inverkeithing quarries. 

Another important trade of Fife from the earliest times 
has been its fisheries. While the larger shipping more and 
more deserted its shores, the fishing craft remained faithful to 
the seaside villages, especially those of the east coast from 
St Andrews to Kirkcaldy. The good fishing-ground of the 
Forth, especially at the back of the May, famous at least 
as early as the days of William the Lion, lay at their doors, 
and its open mouth invited them to try the wider and stormier 
ocean. The herring and the white fish, especially, cod, ling, 
whiting, and haddock, and, though in less quantity, the flat 
fish, flounders, soles, and turbot, by their different seasons,

CHARACTER OF THE FISHERS. 223 

occupied nearly the whole of the fishers' year. There was no 
need, as in districts farther from markets, for the Fife fisher- 
men to eke out a scanty living by agriculture. They were in 
some places of foreign origin, from Flanders, Denmark, or the 
North German coast. Those of Buckhaven are said to have 
sprung from a shipwrecked crew of Brabant in the reign 
of Philip II., and the natives of the Tent Muir were at one 
time called Danes; but no one is bound to accept literally 
these tales of ancient mariners. The fishers of Fife are, at 
least by origin, a separate hereditary class. Like other hered- 
itary classes, they are conservative of old dress, customs, and 
privileges, marrying chiefly members of their own class. A 
few surnames, such as Deas and Thomson, are so frequent 
that the custom was, and still is, to distinguish men by the 
names of their wives, and when this resource fails, of their 
boats or their by-names. Their quaint angular little harbours 
and fishing craft have something of a Continental, but, if an 
Irish bull may be pardoned, a Scottish Continental character. 
Perhaps fishing folk have common ways in different quarters 
of the globe. Their own masters, and living the free life 
of the sea, they are an independent and fearless race. Some 
of them have been fond of distant adventure, like Alexander 
Selkirk of I^argo, the original of " Robinson Crusoe," and in 
former times the whalers of Kirkcaldy. They all are ready to 
brave the dangers of the deep, in which, almost within sight 
of shore, between the Oxcar and the May, "many a ship 
has been cast away." The tragedy of their common lot is 
seen when a company of grave men, both old and young, 
in sober black and brown, is met crossing the sands with the 
coffin of one of their comrades to the nearest kirkyard. 

The fishers* words are few, but when they speak it is with 
the emphasis of experience. Canny and reticent, they eye 
with calm curiosity the observant artist taking a rapid sketch,

224 COURSE AND EXTENT OF FISHING. 

or the inquisitive stranger who passes a few hours' or days' 
holiday where they have their homes, and spend in apparent 
listless laziness the brief portions of their lives when they 
are not at sea. The course of their fishing, as it was de- 
scribed more than two hundred years ago, has altered little, 
and only altered when the capricious changes of the herring 
have made it necessary. In winter they fished off their own 
coast with line for cod, haddock, and ling ; in March they 
went north and fished cod off the Orkneys, and brought 
the fish home half dried, to be better dried at home for ex- 
port sales. Early in June they started for the drave or deep- 
water herring-fishing all round the Scottish and on the English 
seaboard as far as Yarmouth and Lowestoft, and this con- 
tinued till the end of July, when they returned and fished 
for herring in the mouth of the Forth, and in the autumn 
they went to the Lewes and west coast herring-fishing. The 
summer herring have now changed their route, and do not 
come in any number to the Forth, and this part of the fishing 
has almost ceased; but there is a more constant demand 
for white fish, and some of the fishers do not leave their 
home ports, and continue to supply the markets of Edinburgh 
and the South. It is a common belief that the herring-drave 
will some day return. From the Fishery Report of 1883 
we learn that the Anstruther or East Neuk district, from 
Buckhaven to St Andrews, had 830 boats, manned by 3491 
men and boys. The total tonnage was 10,663, and the total 
value about ;£^6 7,000. The number of boats was yV&gt; the 
tonnage yV&gt; ^^^ ^^^ value of boats, nets, and lines J of the 
whole of Scotland. But these figures have all been reduced 
since that date, and many of the fishers of Fife have taken to 
other trades. In 1894 the number of boats employed in this 
district had fallen to 686, the tonnage to 9613, and the men 
and boys employed to 2980. These figures do not, however.

STEAM TRAWLERS AND STEAM LINERS. 22$ 

include the statistics of the Fife coast from Kincardine-on-Forth 
to Wemyss, which are included in the Leith district, and require 
the addition of 86 boats belonging to the ports or creeks of 
Kincardine, Limekilns, Inverkeithing, Aberdour, Burntisland, 
Kinghom, Kirkcaldy, Dysart, and Wemyss. The total num- 
ber of boats engaged in the Fife sea -fisheries in 1894 was 
therefore 772. The number of men and boys employed and 
the tonnage of the boats are not given, as they might usefully 
be, in the fishing statistics according to ports or creeks, but 
only according to districts. An interesting feature in the 
receipt history of the Fife sea-fisheries is the success which has 
attended the introduction of steam liners, or line fishing-boats 
propelled by steam. After paying one-half of the profits to 
the owners of the steam liners, five of these boats manned 
by Cellardyke men earned during the year an average of 
;^io3, los. per man. This application of steam to fishing- 
boats has many advantages. The fish shoals can be more 
ea«ly followed, and storms more easily avoided. Nor had the 
owners of the boats, who, after allowing for depreciation and 
carrying forward a balance to next year, received a dividend 
of 1 2 Jr^ per cent, reason to complain of this new experiment, 
which is making rapid progress. 

A few of the smaller industries of Fife deserve a brief 
notice. Shipbuilding was early practised in the infancy of 
navigation, for which the woods and small havens of the 
coast afforded many facilities. The St Salvator, the barge 
of Bishop Kennedy in the reign of James III., and the 
Flower, the Yellow Carvel, the Lion, the Great St Michael, 
the ships built by Sir Andrew Wood and the Bartons, in that 
of James IV., have been already noticed. The shipping of 
Fife would appear to have been trifling from the returns in 
the time of the Commonwealth, the earliest Customs statistics 
we possess. But it must be kept in view that the Union of 

p

226 SHIPBUILDING. 

the Crowns and the Civil War had greatly reduced its pro- 
portions. 

Tucker, in his Report to the Commissioners of Scotch 
Customs in 1656, reckons only fifty vessels for all Fife from 
Burntisland to Southferry, now Tayport, with a total tonnage 
of 1 291. Of these Kirkcaldy, the chief port, had 12, and 
a tonnage of 592 tons. But in 1692 the same port had 
increased its tonnage to 12 13 tons and 14 vessels. 

Yet, compared with the otUer ports of Scotland, Fife had 
a large share; for the tonnage of the vessels which traded 
from Kirkcaldy in 1692 was surpassed by Leith alone, which 
had 1700 tons, while Glasgow had only 11 72. The same 
observer noted that Fife was "one of the best and richest 
counties in Scotland," but this was, when he wrote, "more 
from the goodness and fertility of the soil than any traffic," 
which " made it the residence and seat of many of the gentry, 
who have wholly driven out all but their tenants and peasants 
to the shore side." Shipbuilding has never entirely deserted 
the county, but since the Union it has been unable to stand 
the competition of the great docks and superior harbours of 
the large rivers — the Clyde, the Thames, the Mersey, the Tyne, 
and Belfast Lough. One considerable shipbuilding yard at 
Kinghorn, where several of the steamers for the Peninsular 
and Oriental Company were built in recent times, is now 
little if at all used. Though it is possible the energy which 
has recently been directed to the improvement of the harbours 
of Burntisland, Methil, and Kirkcaldy may to some extent 
revive shipbuilding, as it certainly will give a fresh impulse 
to the export trade, it is not at present probable that any of 
the larger vessels of the future will be launched from the 
shores of Fife. 

The manufacture of salt, once considerable at Dysart, 
Kirkcaldy, and elsewhere on the coast, is now almost ex-

tinct. That of glass, which was first tried in Scotland in 
1 6 1 o, in one of the caves of Wemyss, transferred itself across 
the Forth to Leith in 1689, and since to other districts. 
The use of tiles for roofs, and, after tile -roofs became less 
common, for drainage, has kept alive the brick -works at 
Cupar Muir and other places. 

The county, both inland and on the sea-coast, was from an 
early period accustomed to brew its own beer, and malt- 
houses may still be seen as part of the older farm-steadings. 
Even the fishers brewed. A ballad familiar in the East 
Neuk, though written in Angus, quaintly celebrates a fisher's 
wooing — 

* ' I hae laid a herrin* in saut — 

Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me noo ; 
I hae brewed a forpit o' maut, 
An' I canna come ilka day to woo. " 

In 1 741 there were 27 brewers in Crail, but in 1780 the 
number had fallen to 3, and now the trade is extinct. Since 
private brewing has gone out, there are breweries on a larger 
scale in several of the towns. The extensive growth of barley 
has also given rise to distilleries. During the Commonwealth 
the duties on beer, ale, and aqua vitce of Fife and Kinross, 
let to farm to Thomas Seaton, yielded the largest rent of any 
county in Scotland, ;^5i8i for the year 1656-57, while 
Lanark only yielded ;£^347o, and Mid-Lothian ;£^37i8. The 
whisky of Burntisland and Cameron Bridge is well known, 
though it has not yet acquired the reputation of the High- 
land brands of Glenlivet, Cleinlish, or Talisker. 

Education has long been one of the principal pursuits of 
Scotsmen, and may almost be deemed one of the industries of 
Scotland. It has always been well represented in Fife. The 
seat of the first Scottish University was not likely to overlook 
the claims of the higher education. The want of sufficient

228 UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 

endowments has at times made the University languish, as 
when Dr Johnson visited it; and political leaders, ignorant 
of the wishes of the Scottish nation, have contemplated its 
abolition or absorption. That danger is now past. The 
value of small as well as large colleges is recognised, and the 
benefit of having some of them remote from as well as others 
within the great cities is acknowledged. Nor should the 
association of places of education with the great names of the 
past be lightly regarded as an influence for good on the 
students of the future. The colleges in which Major and 
Buchanan, Robert Watson, Sir John Leslie, Thomas Chalmers, 
and James Ferrier taught, which have been presided over by 
such Principals as Andrew Melville, Samuel Rutherford, Dr 
James Playfair, John Hunter, John Campbell Shairp, and 
John Tulloch, will exert an influence so long as varied 
learning is venerated. 

Now brought within a short hour of Dundee, some share of 
the wealth of that great manufacturing centre may be honour- 
ably employed, not in jealous rivalry, but in friendly co- 
operation in the cause of education. Arts and theology may 
find a natural home in the contemplative and religious atmos- 
phere of the city of the patron saint of Scotland, no longer 
the scene of murders in the name of religion, which, though 
they cannot and ought not to be forgotten, may serve as 
beacons to warn future theologians what crimes intolerance 
has persuaded men not altogether bad to commit, and good 
men to defend. Science and its practical applications, as well 
as medicine and law, may more readily obtain a supply of 
materials and students in* Dundee. It is only prejudice com- 
bined with ignorance which cannot see that in a corporate as 
in a natural body all parts have not the same office. The 
munificent bequest of Mr Berry, one of the many natives of 
Fife who have made a fortune in the colonies, has set an ex-

ample which, if wisely applied and followed, will relieve the 
professors and students of St Andrews from the pecuniary 
pressure so adverse to the pursuit of learning, and wealthy 
manufacturers of Dundee have begun to show an American 
liberality to education in their lives as well as in their wills. 
No one who really knows the circumstances of the Scottish 
universities and the Scottish students can doubt the value of 
such endowments. Their abuse by extravagant scholars, idle 
fellows, and luxurious professors is yet far off, and it may be 
hoped will never come. 

The parish schools of Fife have long enjoyed a good rep- 
utation. Soon after the Reformation it became rare to find 
children who could not read and write, or who were igno- 
rant of the Bible. The school of Kennoway, taught in the 
beginning of the century by William Craik, one of whose 
descendants now takes an honourable part in the improve- 
ment of Scottish education, deserves special notice for its 
influence on the youth of that parish. More recent insti- 
tutions, such as the Madras College at St Andrews, the Waid 
Academy at Anstruther, and the Dollar Academy, just outside 
the boundaries of the county, have given, and still give, to 
boys of pregnant parts opportunities for mounting the ladder 
of knowledge which few other districts of Scotland possess. 
They are the practical and grateful testimony to the value of 
education of the son of a barber of St Andrews, a sailor of 
the East Neuk whose will expressed the pious wish that " the 
Christian religion and the British navy may flourish and 
advance to the end of time," and of a herd-boy of Dollar. 
Their pious founders had felt the need for an improvement of 
its methods, especially in the intermediate stage between the 
parish or primary school and the university or business. The 
High School for girls at St Andrews, by the practical proof it 
has afforded of the fitness of women for the highest education,

has done much to hasten the day when the dream of the 
poet will be realised, and the doors of the University thrown 
open to both sexes without grudging. 

Nor should the printing-press be forgotten. It was at first 
the popular ally, and at a later date the substitute with the 
many for the school and university, and the competitor of the 
pulpit and the platform. It came to St Andrews, as we have 
seen, for the use of Knox and the Reformation, as half a cen- 
tury later it came into Glasgow for the use of the Assembly of 
the Covenanters. The local press of Tullis at Cupar had a 
good repute for correctness even when compared with that of 
the Glasgow press of Foulis. It commenced to print in 1803 
under the energetic management of Robert Tullis who became 
printer to the University of St Andrews. The first book 
printed by him was Sir Robert Sibbald's * History of Fife and 
Kinross,* but it derived its chief fame from the accurate edi- 
tions of the Latin classics, edited by Dr John Hunter, Pro- 
fessor of Humanity at St Andrews. The number of books 
published by him and his son were few, but, as the list 
printed in the Appendix shows, their varied character is a 
mirror of the thoughts which the intelligence of Fife deemed 
best worth printing. The centralisation of modern times has 
not been favourable to the local press, but the Messrs West- 
wood have the laudable ambition to maintain the honour of 
the press of Cupar. The printing of their last publication, 
an elaborate history of the county by Mr A. H. Millar, would 
do credit to any press. On 14th March 1822 Tullis started 
the *Fife Herald,' the first newspaper in the county. One 
of the natives of Fife, Archibald Constable of Carnbee, was 
led, by a schoolboy's book-hunting through the shelves of a 
little shop at Anstruther, to pursue the business of bookseller 
and publisher, and became in his time, in the phrase of Scott, 
the Napoleon of the realm of print, the anticipator of the

cheap press of the present day. At present few books, except 
those of local interest, are printed within the county, for the 
publishing trade in the meantime gravitates to the great 
capitals. But the county possesses a vigorous newspaper 
press, and many of the editors and contributors, both of the 
Edinburgh and London papers, have served an apprenticeship, 
as Alexander Russel of the * Scotsman ' did, in Fife. 

Nothing has yet been said of what nowadays makes the 
shores of Fife familiar to many who take little interest in the 
learning of St Andrews, the romance of Lochleven, the trade 
of Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy, or the fishing of the East 
Neuk. Fife is the birthplace and chief home of golf in Scot- 
land. Its sandy links, with their healthy breezes, have 
become worth more than an earldom in the north. Golf 
has recently produced so copious a literature, by good players 
as well as good writers, that it is as needless as it would be 
rash to risk an opinion whether it came from Holland, or was 
invented by an unknown Scottish shinty - player amusing 
himself at a solitary and happy moment by striking his ball 
into a rabbit-hole and counting the strokes. A more recent 
conjecture traces a connection between it and the game still, 
or not long ago, played at New Year with yetlings or balls of 
cast iron on the sands near the Skilleys of Wemyss, in which, 
as in the North German Klotschiessen, the player who drives 
the ball to the goal in the fewest number of strokes wins. It 
is scarcely necessary to speak of the merits of a game which 
has spread from Scotland over the world. But it may be 
permissible to note that this healthy pastime has a specially 
Scottish character. It is free to all classes, possible to all 
ages, and now to both sexes. It seems specially appropriate 
to the grave judge or reverend divine, — not fast, like French 
rackets, or rapid, like English cricket or American baseball, 
yet it is not despised by athletic youth. An unfavourable

observer might call it slow, and almost, to use inappropri- 
ate epithets, reflective and solemn. The careful golfer some- 
times takes long to determine his stroke, as a chess-player to 
decide his move. An enthusiast would describe it as com- 
bining the varied advantages of a fast and slow game, the 
certainty of science with the charm of hazard. Enforcing 
silence as one of its main rules during play, it yet allows 
the exercise of descriptive, even sometimes, like trout or 
salmon fishing, of imaginative powers after the game is 
over. For Fife it has a utilitarian side, turning to profit- 
able use the barren margin of the coast between the sands 
and the arable land, and filling the little houses of the coast 
towns with summer lodgers, who gain health and relaxation 
from business in an exhilarating exercise, in which they find 
as much zest as children in playing on the sands or swimming 
in the sea. It has even created a new profession, more 
honourable though less lucrative than that of the jockey, 
some of whose members have been typical representatives 
of Fife character. A professor of philosophy has devoted 
some of his few hours of leisure to recording their sayings. 
Another professor seriously asked a visitor how he could 
leave St Andrews when " that great man," naming a champion 
golfer, was coming next day. And a recent writer on the 
historic town was guilty of the bad joke of inserting a 
photograph of a worthy professional where the reader expects 
to find a portrait of John Knox. If, like cricket and the 
other Scottish national game, curling, also a favourite in Fife, 
golf can keep clear of the abuses of betting and prize-getting, 
it may long continue to contribute to the prosperity of the 
county, and to the healthy enjoyment and innocent rivalry 
both of natives and visitors. While St Andrews retains its 
pre-eminence, there are more than ten other golf-courses in 
the county. The walking game will probably survive the

sport of hunting, for there will be bunkers and holes on 
the links after foxes have followed the fate of wolves and 
boars and become extinct in the coverts. 

If hunting, still a favourite sport both in the east and west 
of Fife, should cease, like horse-racing, for which Cupar was 
once celebrated, to maintain its popularity, the lovers of 
riding may find a substitute in the patriotic exercises of the 
Fife Light Horse, whose annals have been worthily recorded 
by its commander, Colonel Anstruther Thomson.

There is something dull in statistics, even of progress. 
Their absence is perhaps one of the causes which makes 
ancient history in general more interesting than modem. 
But modern history has advantages of its own, amongst 
which may be reckoned the more certain and full knowledge 
we possess of individual character. Even when the men 
and women are not so great as the heroes of antiquity or 
the saints of the early ages, their varied lives enable us to 
understand the past to an extent impossible in earlier times. 
Biography becomes, as Plutarch proved, the best illustration of 
history. In our more limited and indeed narrow sphere, we 
may take, as illustrations of the modern history of Fife, Adam 
Smith the philosopher. Sir David Wilkie the artist, Thomas 
Chalmers the preacher, John Campbell the lawyer, and 
David Low, the Episcopal minister of Pittenweem. They

cover almost the whole period from the Union to a time 
within living memory. As we learn from the travellers what 
others have thought of the county, we may learn from their 
lives what have been the aims and achievements of its 
natives. The examples are purposely selected from different, 
indeed diverse, fields. 

Adam Smith, though born in Kirkcaldy, and though he 
spent what he deemed the happiest years of his life there 
preparing the work which gave him European fame, was an 
exceptional rather than an ordinary Fife or Scots man. One 
of the most distinguished men of the generation which re- 
gained for Scotland the character of a literary nation, his 
life was that of a man of letters, quiet, unostentatious, medi- 
tative, without incident, without even the quarrels which 
supply the place of incident in the lives of authors. It was 
a remarkable phenomenon that in so small a country as Scot- 
land, and indeed in a small part of it, so many writers of the 
first rank appeared towards the end of last century. Though 
attempts have been made to explain this, it has never been 
fully explained. It may be partially accounted for by the 
revival after the depression of the Union, by the intercourse 
between Scotland and the Continent, and by the growth of 
philosophy. Perhaps it should be added that the birth of 
genius, like the birth of man, is one of the secrets of 
Providence, which baffles modern science as it baffled ancient 
philosophy. 

The posthumous son of the commissioner of customs at 
Kirkcaldy, bom in 1723, Smith was brought up under the eye 
of his mother, the daughter of a small Fife laird, Douglas 
of Strathendry, near Leslie, whom he had the rare felicity 
not to lose for sixty years. He was a devoted son, his 
mother's home was his home, and her death, followed by 
that of a cousin to whom he was warmly attached, perhaps

236 ADAM SMITH— EDUCATION AND TRAVELS. 

hastened his own, which took place in 1790. Educated 
under a good schoolmaster, David Millar, at Kirkcaldy, then 
for three years at the College of Glasgow, he went as a 
Snell exhibitioner to Oxford, where he remained seven years. 
He disparaged somewhat too much the benefits of his uni- 
versity education, but it fell in a time when the universities 
were at a low ebb both in Scotland and England, and he 
no doubt learnt more from private study than from lectures 
or examinations. Degrees he treated as quackery, and he 
declined to put those he received on the title-page of his 
works. 

Returning to Scotland in 1747, he spent two years at 
Kirkcaldy, then went to Edinburgh, where he lectured on 
Rhetoric and Belles Lettres under the patronage of Lord 
Kames, and became the friend of David Hume. In 1751 
he was elected Professor of Logic at Glasgow, but next year 
gave up that chair for the chair of Moral Philosophy, which 
he occupied for twelve years. His lectures embraced natural 
theology, ethics, politics, and jurisprudence, and were the 
foundations of his subsequent works. The first of these, 
*The Theory of Moral Sentiments,' was published in 1759; 
and the second, * The Wealth of Nations,' in 1 776. A treatise 
on Jurisprudence was projected, but never published. In 1764 
he left Glasgow to travel as tutor with the young Duke of Buc- 
cleuch, and visited France and Switzerland, residing eighteen 
months at Toulouse. This curious choice was due, we may 
believe, to the tutor, not to the pupil ; but they also spent 
some time in Paris. In Paris he made the acquaintance oi 
the brilliant circle of economists and encyclopaedists — Ques- 
nay, Turgot, D'Alembert, Helvetius, and Morellet. Like many 
of his countrymen, he could not learn to speak French well. 
One of the Parisian wits said Smith talked not French, but 
banks and credit.

'WEALTH OF NATIONS ' WRITTEN AT KIRKCALDY. 237 

On his return to Scotland a pension of ^^300 a-year from 
the Duke enabled him to settle at Kirkcaldy and devote 
himself for ten years to the completion of his work on the 
Wealth of Nations. Hume lived only to see its publication, 
but was able to congratulate his friend on its almost instan- 
taneous success. After its publication he went for two years 
to London, where he was hospitably received by the leading 
statesmen as well as literary men. His residence there and 
in Glasgow enabled him to see trade on a large as he saw 
it in Kirkcaldy on a small scale, and gave his work a prac- 
tical character seldom to be found in philosophical treatises, 
whose writers are too often men of the study, not of the 
world. Smith then came to Edinburgh, where he remained 
till his death, having been appointed commissioner of cus- 
toms. Between the duties of office and the pleasures of the 
select and cultivated society of old Edinburgh, he found 
no time for further authorship. In 1787 he was elected 
Rector of Glasgow, an honour which gave him pleasure. 
The trivial nature of the anecdotes handed on by successive 
biographers indicates the placid tenor of his life. They 
mostly turn on his absence of mind and habit of talking 
to himself. It does not add much to the knowledge of his 
character that we are told he was stolen by gipsies at the 
age of three ; or that he walked in his morning indoor clothes 
from Kirkcaldy to Dunfermline, where he was roused from 
his reverie by hearing the church bells ; or that on another 
occasion, when talking to himself on the street of Kirkcaldy, 
an old wife, taking him for a daft beggar, called out, " Hegh, 
man, but he's weil put on ! " (well dressed). Another anec- 
dote illustrates better his habitual absence of mind. Meet- 
ing in Edinburgh a lady to whom he had unsuccessfully 
long before paid his addresses, he did not recognise her 
until his cousin. Miss Douglas, said to him, " Don't you

know, Adam, this is your ain Jeannie ! " but the unexpected 
discovery did not disturb his more than philosophical calm. 
The story of these addresses, though told on good authority, 
I should not like to vouch for personally. The lady having 
given a positive and too prompt " No " in the morning, met 
Smith in the afternoon unexpectedly, as people do in the 
streets of a small town, and curtsying said, " Sir, I made a 
mistake this morning." "So did I, madam," he replied, 
and walked on. Like his friend Hume, a social favourite 
of the gentler sex, it may be doubted whether he had ever 
been in love. 

The etching of Kay and the medallion of Tassie show 
that he paid attention to his toilet, and that he was one ol 
the notable characters of the Edinburgh streets, whose narrow 
limits gave good opportunity for observation of character. 
His letters, especially to Hume, exhibit him in the pleasing 
light of an affectionate friend, and Hume congratulated him- 
self that from his window in James' Court he could see the 
lights of Adam Smith at Kirkcaldy. While he declined to 
publish the posthumous works of the sceptical philosopher, 
he contributed an account of his last moments, which created 
scandal at the time from the stoical equanimity with which 
Hume contemplated his own approaching death. Both men 
were far removed from the religious views current amongst 
the great majority of their countrymen. They probably, on 
this account, emphasised in their own quiet but decided 
way the distance between the philosophical and popular 
views of life. 

The genius of Smith may most fairly be judged from 
his chief work, which founded in Great Britain, and aided 
in spreading through Europe, a new science, political eco- 
nomy, and is greater than the science it originated. It is, 
with the exception of the work of Grotius, the first important

VALUE OF HIS WORK. 239 

and successful attempt, since those of the Greek masters of 
philosophy, to treat a large part of politics not as an art or 
craft, but as an organised branch of knowledge, having for its 
object the wellbeing of mankind. Nor has it as yet had a 
successor of the same value. Throughout it Smith is not 
only the advocate of free trade, the opponent of monopoly 
and privilege in every shape, but also the steady friend of 
the poorer classes, and the champion of sound as opposed 
to pedantic education. His Utilitarianism is not the narrow 
creed of the philosophical sect afterwards so called, but the 
nobler doctrine of Socrates and Bacon. His treatise is an 
implicit argument in favour of the maxim which Bentham after- 
wards formulated, that the aim of the statesman should be the 
greatest good of the greatest number. And though the influ- 
ence of Kant, Fichte, and Hegel in Germany must not be 
overlooked, it is the special distinction of Smith that, more 
and longer than any other philosopher either in Great Britain 
or the Continent, he has educated statesmen and directed the 
course of practical politics. The statesmen of to-day, few of 
whom have so much reverence for philosophers, would not 
perhaps rise as Pitt and his friends did when Smith came 
into the room, but they continue to profit by his labours. 
It is easy to find errors in his arrangement or in a few 
points in his treatise, and some of his editors and successors 
have occupied themselves with the task. It is not so easy 
to compose a treatise on politics which should include so 
large a collection of valuable facts, so much sound know- 
ledge, such wide-reaching and far-sighted reasoning. This 
no one has yet done, scarcely any one has attempted to do. 
If we compare the * Wealth of Nations * with the * Political 
Economy' of John Stuart Mill, probably the best of such 
attempts, we are at once sensible how far the work of the 
writer of the eighteenth surpasses that of the writer of the

nineteenth century, both in its object and in its accomplish- 
ment. Kirkcaldy may well be proud of having given birth 
to such a practical philosopher, and desire to perpetuate his 
memory by a public hall instead of by the close, at present his 
only memorial. It is not creditable that the niche reserved 
for him in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland has not 
yet been filled by one of his many wealthy countrymen. 

Three Fife boys born within the decade in which Adam 
Smith died, afford examples of the character and varied talent 
of the county in the first half of the present century. Thomas 
Chalmers was born at Anstruther on 17th March 1780. John 
Campbell was born in Cupar on 15th September 1779. David 
Wilkie was born in the manse of Cults on i8th November 
1785. As was natural, they were not unknown to each other. 
The manse of Cults was within a short walk of Cupar, and the 
first wife of Wilkie's father was Mary Campbell, sister of the 
minister of Cupar, " one of the most beautiful women in Fife." 
So the two boys were, to use a convenient Scotch expression, 
connected though not related. Their fathers had been college 
friends ; and Campbell and Wilkie went to London about the 
same time in search of fortune. When Wilkie returned to 
Cupar after he had found fame, he was entertained to dinner 
by the Presbytery of Cupar. Old Dr Campbell, who had not 
been at a meeting for two years, took the chair, and, placing 
Wilkie as the guest of the evening on his right, told him, " his 
father, from his office [probably clerk to the Presbytery], used 
always to sit there, and had been one of his earliest friends 
and college acquaintances, and had always great confidence 
in him." 

John Campbell and Thomas Chalmers were fellow-students 
at St Andrews, to which they both went before they were twelve. 
Campbell matriculated in 1790, and Chalmers in 1791. They 
were members of the same Theological Debating Society in

DAVID WILKIE, THE ARTIST. 24I 

1 795-96. Wilkie was an early friend of Chalmers, who was a 
co-presbyter of his father, and the young and rising artist paid 
visits to the hospitable manse of Kilmany. • When Chalmers 
roused the fashionable and political world of London by his 
sermons in 1822, Wilkie took his brother artists Sir Thomas 
Lawrence and Thomas Phillips to hear and be introduced to 
his countryman. " With all his disadvantages of voice, figure, 
manner, and action," he says, taking an artist's view of a 
preacher, " ChaUners seemed to get hold of the attention and 
carry it along with him from first to last, and with qualities 
that were calculated for anything but eloquence he produced 
the effects of eloquence the most striking." Lord Cockburn 
gives an almost identical description of Chalmers's " external 
disadvantages of a bad figure, voice, gesture, and look, and an 
unusual plainness of Scotch accent " ; and adds that " he is 
a great orator, in effect unapproached in our day." In one of 
Wilkie's unused sketches for the picture of Knox dispensing 
the Sacrament, he introduced the massive head of Chalmers 
and the fine profile and dark eye of Edward Irving. 

It is worth while to try to give outlines of the lives of the 
three men who first saw the light in the same atmosphere 
of Fife in the end of the last century, whose careers were 
so different, and who, each following his natural bent, left 
so considerable a mark in the fields of theology, law, and 
art Art is a more rapid growth than theology or law, and 
Wilkie, the youngest of the three boys, was the first to gain 
distinction. He came, as genius often comes, from a family 
not without talent, though of a different kind from his own. 
His father collected and reasoned on some of the earliest 
statistics of life which led to the useful system of life insurance, 
and his uncle was an ingenious professor at St Andrews, 
a better agriculturist than poet, the early friend of Robert 
Fergusson. He went to London in 1805, became, in spite

of their contrast in character, the friend of his fellow-student, 
the romantic enthusiast Haydon, with whom he competed at 
the Academy ; travelled in Devonshire and France, and shared 
the patronage of Lord Mulgrave and Sir George Beaumont, 
wealthy connoisseurs of that day. His " Village Politicians," 
exhibited in London in 1806, confirmed the reputation he 
had acquired in Fife by " Pitlessie Fair," the germ of all his 
best work. He died off Gibraltar in 1841. The picture of 
his burial at sea was the splendid tribute paid to the memory 
of the greatest realist of the British school since Hogarth, by 
the imagination of Turner, its greatest idealist. Although 
no mean master of portraiture, a brilliant etcher, and, had 
not ill health weakened his hand, perhaps capable of historic 
and foreign subjects, it is as the interpreter of the rural life 
of his countrymen at the village fair, or on benches round 
the inn table, or listening to the blind fiddler by the cottage 
fireside, or playing blind-man's buff in the farm kitchen, or 
paying rent to the factor in the dining-room of the laird, that 
Wilkie has never been equalled. His father's kirk was his 
first studio, and the parishioners of Cults were his first models. 
As many as one hundred and fifty, each distinct and character- 
istic, were transferred to the small canvas of " Pitlessie Fair." 
Some of them were sketched, it was said, during sermons. In 
several of his later pictures of this class, though painted in 
London, as the " Distraint for Rent," we still recognise the 
faces of the men of Fife of a former generation : a shrewd, 
pawky, humorous, queer, good-tempered race, rarely beautiful, 
but generally full of character and intelligence, fond of talk 
and quiet as well as boisterous fun, yet not without the " true 
pathos and sublime of human life" they would rather hide 
than show, but which the eye of the artist saw and revealed. 

A refined and poetic Englishman, Edward Fitzgerald, who 
deemed himself a good critic of painting, said, " There was

ORIGINALITY OF HIS GENIUS. 243 

always something vulgar about Wilkie." It is true that he 
drew his subjects from common life, but in his style there is 
nothing vulgar. It is the life of small circles : his scenes are 
taken from the cottage, the farm, the village, and the village 
inn. They are very different from those of the higher or 
middle or even the lower classes in great cities, but so true to 
human nature that even those who have never seen what the 
artist portrays recognise its reality and may read its lesson. 
The best artist of this school is a moralist unconscious or half- 
unconscious of his moral, for he is generally absorbed in the 
single aim of representing life as it is. Wilkie has been 
compared with Teniers and the Dutch painters of still life, or 
with Hogarth and other delineators of English character, 
but the comparison only serves to show how original was 
his genius, and how much he drew from his native soil. 
He never saw a specimen of Teniers nor a print of Hogarth 
before he had formed his style. "He showed me," says 
Haydon, "his wonderful picture of *The Fair,' painted at 
nineteen, before he had ever seen a Teniers." He was less 
of a realist than Teniers ; painted, as Lord Campbell aptly 
says, not exactly what he had seen, but what he might have 
seen ; and he has none of Hogarth's caricature. Like most 
men of genius, he was self-taught, though he seized the op- 
portunities for observation that his home and its surroundings 
gave him, and strengthened his powers by study. Haydon 
describes his person with an artist's pen : " He was tall, pale, 
gaunt, with a fine eye, short nose, vulgar, humorous mouth, 
but quiet energy of expression," and tells a story of his find- 
ing him studying his own person before a mirror to save the 
expense of a model, — an English joke at the canny Scot. In 
private life Wilkie was simple, kindly, genial, modest though 
confident in his opinions, with a power of clear expression 
in words as well as in paint, which some great artists have

lacked, and a share of that Fife character which he knew 
so well how to depict. 

It is impossible briefly to delineate the large and noble 
character of Thomas Chalmers. The generation has passed 
which was fascinated by his eloquence, stimulated by his 
active benevolence, or converted by his fervid oratory and 
practical piety. His influence was personal, what is called 
magnetic. Chalmers applied that epithet to Irving, and 
ascribed his own attraction to the more ordinary force of 
gravitation. Dr John Brown, perhaps with a reminiscence 
of this modesty, calls him "a solar man, who drew after 
him a firmament of planets." We cannot understand the 
extent of his powers from a perusal of his works, even with 
the aid of his life by one who knew and loved him, his son- 
in-law, Dr Hanna. It is only when some grave man ap- 
proaching old age, his hearer or student, speaks of him, that 
we begin partly to realise the quality of his genius. The eye 
will kindle, and the feeling, often latent under a cold exterior, 
become visible, as he recalls the high thoughts expressed in 
fit words, the air of command, the irresistible flow, even the 
marked peculiarities of "a low, rough, husky voice, guttural 
articulation, a whitish eye, hidden by bushy eyebrows which 
shone when he became animated, and a large dingy counte- 
nance," of the great preacher. And there is abundant testi- 
mony from men outside the circles in which he worked that 
this is not the bias of affection, of national or sectarian spirit 
" I have often," writes Cockburn, himself an orator, " hung 
upon his words with a beating heart and a tearful eye, without 
being brought to my senses till I read next day the syllables 
that had moved me to admiration, but which then seemed 
cold." 

Yet there is also evidence, which cannot be neglected in a 
fair estimate, that Chalmers was greatest as a preacher and a

philanthropist. Carlyle, though he respected Chalmers, thought 
his contemporaries exaggerated his talents and genius. Nor 
have his works retained a standard place in philosophy, 
science, or even theology. Perhaps he attempted too much, 
and, like other powerful men who have made a wonderful 
present impression by varied excellence, sacrificed more lasting 
fame. Even as an orator he is not of the rare few who speak 
so as to be listened to by posterity, though he has left some 
memorable thoughts hidden in the too copious language which 
charmed and overcame his audience. Such is the often 
quoted phrase, "The expulsive power of a new affection," 
the title of one of his sermons. But he cared little for fame, 
having fixed his eye where he strove to fix that of his 
hearers, beyond the earthly scene. He was not free from 
ambition and the desire of success in the fields in which he 
laboured, but he restrained this desire as much as was possible 
in a man conscious of great gifts of thought and of action. 

The main facts of his life may be soon told. The sixth 
of a family of fourteen children of John Chalmers, a general 
merchant in Anstruther-Easter, who had the best library in 
the small burgh, and Margaret Hall, the daughter of a wine 
merchant of Crail, he gained at Anstruther school the char- 
acter of one of " the idlest, strongest, merriest, and most 
generous-hearted boys." When not yet twelve he went to 
college at St Andrews in November 1791, distinguished him- 
self chiefly in mathematics during his arts course, and in 1795 
entered the Divinity Hall, continuing to pay more attention 
to general culture, especially in mathematics and natural 
science, than to theology. He took an interest in history, 
though he was more occupied with the present than the past. 
A Fife lady, Mrs Morison-Duncan of Naughton, told me she 
remembered as a child hearing him say, with his happy knack 
of expressing simple things which caught the memory, " Be

kind to the Dyke." The few fragments of the Danes Dyke 
still left show that this saying was needed then and should 
not be forgotten now. 

His early inclination to mathematical study continued 
through life, and had some curious practical results. He 
called his ideas "propositions," and divided his Glasgow 
parish into "proportions." When at Kilmany he bought a 
horse which had an unlucky propensity to throw its rider, 
and he determined to sell it when it had thrown him ten 
times. It was said he regulated the strokes of his razor 
by the theory of maxima and minima, and in walking swung 
his stick by the rules of arithmetic He was licensed as a 
preacher in 1799, when only nineteen. He then went to 
Edinburgh, where he attended the classes of natural and 
moral philosophy, preferring Robison the professor of the 
former to Dugald Stewart the more eloquent teacher of the 
latter subject, taught pupils, and occasionally preached. After 
a short assistantship at Cavers, he was ordained in May 1803 
minister of Kilmany, a small country parish in the north of 
Fife. The winter before he had acted as mathematical 
assistant at St Andrews, and he continued for a time to give 
lectures both on mathematics and chemistry after becoming 
minister of Kilmany. He did this against his father's wish 
and the remonstrance of some members of his presbytery. 
He stoutly defended non-residence and the combination of 
parochial and educational work, which a few years after, and 
throughout the rest of his life, he as stoutly condemned in 
the case of a professor. It is the penalty of an orator to 
exaggerate his own inconsistency. 

His first publication was an * Inquiry into the Extent and 
Stability of National Resources,' and Economics always occu- 
pied a large share of his attention. Before he was twenty-five 
he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of Natural

Philosophy at St Andrews, and of Mathematics at Edinburgh. 
He had always confidence, and at this time pride, in his own 
abilities, and as with many able Scottish students, a university 
professorship was his goal. A severe illness, the death of 
a brother and sister, and the perusal of Wilberforce's * Prac- 
tical View of Christianity,' caused a change in his character. 
The legend formerly told in Fife, that like Saul he had 
been converted by a lightning-flash, has the prosaic explana- 
tion that once, when riding, he broke some chemical bottles 
in his pocket which startled his horse. It was no sudden 
call, but a severe mental as well as spiritual discipline, which 
led him to accept what were at the time termed Evangelical 
views, and to abandon those called by the Evangelicals 
Moderate, for the Calvinistic creed of his father. But his 
Calvinism was without bitterness, to some extent modified 
by glimpses of other philosophies than that of Geneva, 
by the study of the * Marrow of Modem Divinity,' and by 
respect for friends who had a larger hope in the providence 
of God, most of all by a practical charity which often cuts 
the knots of theologians. 

In 181 2 he made a happy marriage, and he continued till 
July 1815 to discharge the high duties of a parish minister, 
instructing the young, rousing the careless, guiding the 
anxious, visiting the sick, supporting the dying. Like other 
Presbyterian ministers, he took part in the business of the 
Presbytery and Assembly without allowing this or literary 
work to divert him from his pastoral cure. His natural 
eloquence had stood the test of a Scottish country audience, 
critical alike in oratory and theology. Transplanted to 
Glasgow, his inexhaustible energy found new scope in the 
large parishes of the Tron and St John's ; and for eight 
years he proved himself as good a city as he had been a 
country minister — preaching to rich and poor, learned and

unlearned, the gospel of his Master. His Astronomical 
and Commercial Discourses belong to this period. The 
Territorial system, under which a definite area was assigned 
to each minister. and divided into districts, which enabled 
one man, with lay as well as clerical help, to visit, catechise, 
and preach to all classes and ages, showed his power of 
organisation. He made an experiment in the large city 
parish of supporting the poor by voluntary charity personally 
distributed in their homes instead of by legal assessment and 
subject to the test of the poorhouse, which succeeded while 
his spirit directed the work, and even for a time after, but 
was subsequently abandoned. 

He fretted at the inroads on a hard-working minister's 
time made by the social and business engagements of a 
large city; and though, unwilling to quit the sphere where 
he had gathered round him a devoted body of agents in 
his philanthropic works, he refused a call to Stirling, he 
accepted in 1823 the chair of Moral Philosophy at St 
Andrews. The comparative leisure of a Scottish professor- 
ship in the last generation, and importance of its duties, and 
a desire to return to the alma mater of his native county, 
turned the scale. He held it for five years, and though 
possessing no original philosophical power, his enthusiasm, 
eloquence, and moral as well as religious character, impressed 
his students more than any system of ethics. In 1828 he 
was appointed Professor of Theology in the University of 
Edinburgh, an ofl5ce he held till 1843, when he left the 
Established and became the first Moderator of the Assembly 
of the Free Church, and the first Principal of the New 
Divinity College in Edinburgh. Shortly before, he had given 
a course of lectures in support of the principle of an Estab- 
lished Church in London, where his reputation as a preacher 
was already known. The Establishment which he defended

CHURCH PRINCIPLES AND ADMINISTRATION. 249 

was not the one he left, but a Church supported by, but in- 
dependent of, the State. It was the Church which Knox had 
laboured* but failed to establish, and which the Covenanters 
had for a time maintained by force, but which had never 
existed except in theory since the Restoration. Its funda- 
mental principle he deemed violated when the voice of the 
congregation was not dominant in the choice of its minister, 
and when the voice of the assembly of ministers and elders 
was subject to the restraints of temporal authority. Unlike 
former secessions, which were to a large extent local, the 
Free Church aimed at being national, and planted a min- 
ister in almost every parish. 

Chalmers opposed till his death the Voluntary principle 
of separation between Church and State, and those of his 
successors who have adopted it have in vain sought to 
find in his writings or speeches any support for their altered 
view. The Established Church of Scotland mourned his 
loss, as that of England mourned the loss of Newman. 
His fertile mind was always active in authorship, as twenty- 
five volumes published in his life, besides sermons and pos- 
thumous works, prove. They treat of subjects of the highest 
importance, — Natural and Dogmatic Theology, the Evidences 
of Christianity, Church Establishment, Church Extension, 
Pauperism, and Political Economy. 

While in the Establishment he carried out the largest 
scheme for Church extension then known in Scotland, add- 
ing 200 churches to those already existing. The voice of 
a single preacher did more than the bequest of a millionaire 
which has in some ways continued his work. After he left 
it, aided by the eloquent speeches of able coadjutors, he 
placed on a solid basis the Sustentation Fund, which en- 
abled most of the ministers, who had sacrificed stipends 
and homes to their principles, to look back without regret.

2SO ESTIMATE OF HIS CHARACTER. 

to their deliverance from the bondage of the State, and from 
dependence on the landowners and the Court for scanty 
salaries. The minimum stipend of the Free Church was 
fixed at a larger sum than Wilkie's father or Chalmers him- 
self had received as parish ministers in Fife. He died sud- 
denly on the night of 30th May 1847. His death was felt to 
be a national calamity. There had been no more eminent 
Scottish minister in modem times, and few, if any, finer 
characters. 

He was an orator without vanity, a Church leader who 
was corrupted neither by the power he exercised nor by 
popular applause, nor by the more insidious flattery of 
friends. The only faults that have been found by keen- 
eyed critics were a love of command, combined, strangely 
enough, with an absence of decision at critical moments, as 
when Campbell of The Row and his former assistant Edward 
Irving were prosecuted for heresy, or when the Free Church 
left the Establishment But a love of command was scarcely 
a fault in one born to be a commander; while his very 
occasional indecision may most justly be attributed to the 
balance of arguments, which often makes strong minds hesi- 
tate, and allows weaker but more self-confident men to take 
the lead. His intellect was disciplined by suffering and 
his keen temper chastened by humility. He exhibited the 
strength of the national character refined and purified by 
Christianity. Take him all in all, he was probably the best 
of the famous men Fife has produced. 

It is a change to pass from the great preacher and suc- 
cessful philanthropist to the able and successful lawyer. But 
regarding both as representative of the Scottish character as 
produced in Fife, the limited scope of all here said, a notice 
of Lord Campbell is as necessary as that of Dr Chalmers. 
In one view the life of the former is the more instructive,

JOHN CAMPBELL, SON OF CUPAR MINISTER. 25 1 

for he was a conspicuous example of an average, though a 
high average, of talent, while the latter is a singular instance 
of qualities few men possess or acquire. 

An English noble, the late Lord Derby, bom to great 
estates and a ready entrance to the highest offices of State, 
when chosen, because of his political prominence. Rector of 
a Scottish University, addressed the students on the virtue 
of content and the vice of ambition. He was listened to in 
dead silence, and the address, with its wholesome but one- 
sided moral, made no impression on his hearers, and though 
delivered only a few years ago, has probably been forgotten. 
Could the three Fife youths whose career is under review 
have been present, not one of them would have accepted 
his counsel. Some of those who heard him may have re- 
membered what Wilkie had done in art, more what Campbell 
had done in law, and a few the services of Chalmers to his 
fellow-men. 

John, at one time called Jock or Plain John, now more 
usually Lord, Campbell, is one of the best instances in recent 
times of the practice of the art vulgarly described as the art 
of "getting on." It is sometimes regarded as an art in 
which Scotsmen are proficients, yet it is not unknown in 
other countries. Its aim is not ideal, and it should be, as 
indeed it generally is, estimated at its true value. The son 
of the minister of Cupar, the descendant of a Fife laird, 
with a somewhat uncertain connection with the Campbells 
who had been ennobled as Earls of Argyll and Breadalbane, 
John Campbell, after a few years* schooling at Cupar, was 
sent to St Andrews, where he began the arts course at the 
age of eleven, and passed into that of theology at the age 
of fifteen. After two years* study he went to London as 
tutor to the son of a merchant. He soon began to write 
for the press, and to form the idea that he would prefer

252 IN LONDON AND AT THE BAR, 

the English Bar to the Scottish Church. "Some people," 
he writes, in order to overcome his father's objections, 
"would be extremely happy with a country kirk in Scot- 
land. I am no longer of the number — not from any dislike 
to obscurity, but from a horror of inaction. When I am 
employed I am happy, when I am idle I am miserable." 

The pay of a reporter to the * Morning Chronicle,* and 
some aid from his brother, a doctor in India, enabled him 
to carry out his aim, and he set himself with indefatigable 
industry to prepare for the profession he had fixed on, and 
in which he soon believed himself capable of reaching the 
highest honours. He entered Lincoln's Inn, became a 
student and assistant of Tidd, the special pleader, and was 
called to the Bar in 1806. Making little the first year, he 
took to publishing Reports of Jury Trials at Nisi Prius, in 
which, for the first time in England, he shrewdly gave the 
attorneys* names, and served the apprenticeship of work 
without pay for the English barristers, who, by a bad prac- 
tice, unfortunately sanctioned by professional usage, take the 
pay without doing the work. After changing to the Oxford 
Circuit in his fourth year, he began to make his own way 
slowly but surely; and writing to his brother, congratulates 
himself on his escape from being a country minister. "I 
might have had a family in Scotland; but in penury and 
obscurity what pleasure could this have afforded me? My 
society would have consisted of clownish farmers richer than 
myself, and perhaps a laird more insolent but not more 
cultivated. I now live on a footing of perfect equality with 
men of high birth and of the best education and most 
elegant manners." 

His success was due to steady industry, never missing a 
chance, a vigorous constitution, and a buoyant temper. He 
knew his strength lay in perseverance, and, what was rarer,

HIS AMBITION AND ITS ATTAINMENT. 253 

recognised the strength as well as the weakness of his rivals, 
the versatile talents of Brougham, the sounder though less 
popular gifts of Copley, the limited, but, within its limits, 
unrivalled legal knowledge of Sugden, as well as those of the 
crowd of lesser lights of the Bar and Bench. Though im- 
mersed in business, he frequented society and the theatre, 
went occasional tours to France, or to Fife to visit his father, 
and carried on an active correspondence with his father and 
brother, keeping them up to all his thoughts and doings. 
He always writes naturally and without the least tinge of 
affectation. His chief thought was how to get business, and 
more business than any one else. His father taught him, 
when he took him as a boy to St Andrews, the line of the 
Greek poet inscribed on the wall of the examination hall — 
" Always to do the best and be superior to the rest " ; and 
he applied it through life in a way neither Homeric nor 
Heroic. He now began to think of marriage, and in 181 7, 
half in jest, told his father to look out for a wife, and to say 
if asked what his son's rent-roll was, " a rood of land at West- 
minster worth ^3000 a-year." Four years after he married 
Miss Scarlett, a daughter of the celebrated advocate, who, 
after a brilliant career at the Bar, in part of which his son- 
in-law was his chief competitor, became Lord Abinger and 
Chief Baron. 

In 1827 he was made a Queen's Counsel, and in 1830 
declined an offer of an ordinary judgeship, and became 
member for Stafford, which cost him a good deal of money. 
It was common in these days for a successful lawyer to pay 
several thousands for a seat, and if under eight, it was reckoned 
a good investment. Such men went into Parliament almost 
solely with a view to professional promotion, and this object, 
even more than the difference between forensic and parlia- 
mentary talent, has led to the low estimation in which lawyers

have been often held in the House of Commons. In politic 
Campbell was a Whig, supported the Reform Bill, Burgh an 
Law Reform, carried several useful measures of law reforn 
and made the first of many unsuccessful attempts to pass 
Bill for a Register of Land in England, but he never acquire 
a high reputation in Parliament. He did not understand ih 
popular opinion of Scotland. His action in Parliament i 
favour of Patronage precipitated the Disruption. He had n 
sympathy with the new politics which have decomposed an 
recom posed parties, and wrote to his brother with an acut 
perception of the possible effect of Indian experience, " Fc 
God*s sake do not become a Radical." 

In 1832 he became Solicitor-General in Lord Grey's Ai 
ministration, and wrote to his brother, " This is indeed tV 
crisis of my fate." He lost his English seat, but on Jeffrey 
promotion to the Bench became member for Edinburg] 
Though he spent several vacations in country houses in i 
neighbourhood, and afterwards bought an estate near Je* 
burgh, he had little Scottish patriotism. He despised tl 
Edinburgh Town Council as much as the Fife farmers ar 
lairds. His attachment to Scotland after his father's deal 
was chiefly for the sake of a Scottish seat in Parliamer 
London was his home. He carried without oppositic 
several valuable but limited reforms of the antiquated Engli* 
Law of Real Property, and in 1834 succeeded Home, t 
insignificant lawyer, as Attorney - General, not without £ 
unpleasant suspicion of intrigue, but, according to his ov 
account, against his own will. He held this oflfice with tv 
brief intervals until 1841, and forced the Whig ministers, wl 
knew the value of his services, to make his wife a peere 
as the price of not making himself Master of the Rol

make room for Campbell, but he held it only six weeks, of 
which only four days were spent in Court when the change 
of Government led to his retirement. It w^as a somewhat 
coarse joke of the day that the effect of crossing the Irish 
Channel was to make Campbell throw up the seals. He used 
his leisure to turn author, and wrote the Lives of the Chan- 
cellors and the Chief-Justices, works much criticised for their 
inaccuracy, but entitled to the credit of being useful and 
readable compilations. They will always retain a certain 
value for the fund of anecdote contained in them, which is 
their best point, but also, unfortunately, especially in the later 
volumes, as a painful exhibition of the failings which he took 
pleasure in tracing in the career of his eminent predecessors. 
His autobiography, perhaps, shows him at his best as an 
author. He is as honest and garrulous, not so conceited, as 
Pepys. In 1846, on the return of the Whigs to office, he 
was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and in 
1850, he had for a third time the ill luck or the good 
fortune to drive a competitor. Lord Denman, out of a place 
to which he succeeded, and became Chief- Justice of Eng- 
land. He justified his appointment by displaying the same 
unremitting industry on the Bench as at the Bar. 

In i860 he at last obtained the Chancellorship, an office 
which he had always in view, and had foretold soon after he 
came to the Bar he would reach. He died in office on 2 2d 
June 1 86 1, in his eighty-second year. The lives of his con- 
temporaries Brougham and Lyndhurst, which he left behind 
him for publication, are a studied and partially successful 
attempt to reveal the weaknesses of two of the greatest of his 
contemporaries in his own profession. They scarcely can 
have added, as was said by one of his victims, a new terror to 
death, but they have cast a stain on his own posthumous 
fame. Lyndhurst had been his early, and, politics apart, his

constant friend; and he owed his advancement largely to 
Brougham. Fortunately, the virtues of his private life contrast 
favourably with the faults of his public career. He was a 
dutiful son, an affectionate brother, and a good husband and 
father. 

We may draw from the records of another Church in Fife 
another contrast to the character of Lord Campbell, and a 
fresh illustration of the variety of the men of Fife. 

The Episcopal Church ceased in the seventeenth century 
to be the Church of the majority of the people, and the 
Jacobite sympathies, of its ministers led to its persecution by 
the English Government after the Revolution. Towards the 
end of the eighteenth century, when the Jacobite cause was 
lost, and. the hatred of Prelacy had somewhat moderated, it 
began to recover ground in Fife as elsewhere in Scotland. 
Small in numbers, a sect with thq tradition and the feeling of 
a Church, and retaining the devoted adherence of its followers, 
it stood the trial of adversity better than of prosperity. Its 
bishops, with more scanty stipends than the Presbyterian 
clergy, were men of piety, some of them of learning, and were 
reverenced by their scanty and scattered flocks. They main- 
tained a sort of old-fashioned demeanour, a quaint simplicity 
of manners, and a patriotic love of their country as well as 
their Church. Perhaps they resembled the bishops of the 
primitive Church more than many of their predecessors. 
Several deserved the epithet of saintly which has been applied 
to one, Bishop Jolly. 

Fife, one of the least episcopal of Scottish counties, had 
one of these worthy bishops in David Low, bishop of the 
united dioceses of Moray and Ross, Argyle and the Isles, 
who served as pastor of Pittenweem from 1790 till his death 
in 1856. The poverty and limited numbers of his Church 
during this period made such a combination, which could not

be called a plurality of livings, common and necessary. Low 
was by birth a native of Angus, but settled early in Fife, 
where he lived for more than sixty years. When first ap- 
pointed to Pittenweem, his salary was ^40, and it never 
exceeded ^250 for both offices. Yet out of this stipend 
and a small patrimony, carefully nursed, a long, frugal, and 
celibate life enabled him to endow a separate bishopric of 
Argyle with ^8000, the College of Glenalmond with ;;^iooo, 
and the clergyman of Pittenweem with a small supplement 
to his salary, as well as the old Priory, which he bought for a 
parsonage^ His thin and stooping figure, spindle-legs, and 
keen small eyes peering out under his shovel -hat, were 
known in all the little nest of burghs of the East Neuk, 
and especially, as one who remembers him reports, in the 
book-shop of Mr Cockburn at Pittenweem, the publisher of 
* Anster Fair,* which was the rendezvous of the reading and 
writing youth of the burghs. Many of his parishioners were 
the landward nobility and gentry, who made him welcome in 
their homes, and attended his services, but the Church in 
which he served has always retained some representation of 
all classes. Without brilliant talents, the presbyter bishop 
discharged with unostentatious faithfulness the duties of the 
pastoral charge, and most of the noble lines of Dr Johnson 
on his friend Levitt might have been applied to him : — 

** His virtues walked their narrow round, 

Nor made a pause nor left a void.

Unfelt, uncounted, glided by.

Though now his eightieth year was nigh.

258 EFFECT OF THE LIFE OF A GOOD BISHOP. 

Jacobite generation of Episcopalian clergy and gentry, the 
rarer because Fife had so few Jacobites, made him a favour- 
ite in the little circle in which he lived, and the friend of 
all his neighbours. One of his parishioners, Mr Conolly, the 
town-clerk of the Anstruthers, Kilrenny, and Crail, wrote an 
appreciative notice of his quiet, uneventful life. It was such 
a life, typical of other Scottish bishops of his time, which 
gradually sapped the deep-rooted prejudices of his country- 
men against Episcopacy, recalling by practical and everyday 
examples that there might be bishops of the type of Leighton 
and Ken as well as prelates of the type of Laud and Sharp. 
But Fife still in the main adheres to the Presbyterian Kirk. 
The memory of the acts of Cardinal Beaton and Archbishop 
Sharp has not been redeemed before the tribunal of history 
by the violence of their deaths, still less by the attempts of 
modem biographers to defend their characters.

Leaving for a concluding chapter a general notice of the 
Literature of Fife, it is proposed to treat somewhat more fully, 
though necessarily briefly, the Proverbs and the Songs or 
Ballads of the district. These short utterances are often more 
characteristic than longer works. They are the prose and 
poetry of everyday life, and are known to all or most of the 
natives, even to those who speak little and read less. The 
proverb by its pith or pungency, and the song by its beauty, 
pathos, or humour, express more than the speaker or singer 
wots, and reveal the character of the country where they 
grew, and of the people amongst whom they circulate. Most 
proverbs and songs are anonymous, and even those which 
are not have little of the affectations of avowed authors or 
the formalities of elaborate composition. Indeed traces of 
art are fatal to their general or continued popularity. One

26o SCOTTISH PROVERBS FIRST COLLECTED IN FIFE. 

aim of this sketch being to discover the character of Fife 
and its natives, such natural products of its wit deserve 
special attention. 

It was in Fife that the first collection of Scottish proverbs 
was made. " Every shire or part of a nation," writes the 
Printer to the Merry, Judicious, and Discreet Readers of the 
Proverbs of David Ferguson, minister of Dunfermline, " hath 
some Proverbial Speeches which others hath not." Ferguson's 
collection, though published only in 1644, nearly fifty years 
after his death, had been made during his life in the latter 
half of the sixteenth century. It contains many proverbs or 
sayings not peculiar to Fife, some known in England as well 
as Scotland, and others, translations from the Latin, of which 
more than one collection had been published in the middle 
ages. The adages of Erasmus had spread throughout Europe, 
the proverbial wisdom of Greece and Rome. The Bible 
supplied some, and others, though not many, were borrowed 
from England or France. But there are proverbs which must 
have originated on Scottish soil, and still are, or were till 
recently, well known to its natives. It is to the local pro- 
verbs of Fife the present selection is chiefly confined. In 
making it, the advice of Lord Bacon has been followed, 
** Not to omit any because they are vulgar, for many vulgar 
are excellent good, nor for the meanness of the persons," 
and I shall be happy if " a few that otherwise would have 
died" are added to those more familiar. In an essay on 
Scottish Proverbs, a Kinross-shire man, Mr Logie Robertson, 
remarks : " Probably the proverbs and the songs, with certain 
favourite passages of Burns, will be the longest lived and last 
portions of the wreck of the Scottish language. Of these at 
the present day, when Lowland Scotch is yet spoken, the 
proverbs are not the least vital." But the recent novelists, 
who need not be ashamed of the nickname of the Kailyaird

CHARACTER OF PROVERBS. 26 1 

school, have shown that it is too soon to speak of the wreck 
of Broad Scots, though so many of us have forgotten and 
more of us neglect its classics. It is at least a wreck which 
yet affords good salvage. 

All countries and districts which have character have 
proverbs, the happy or lucky sayings that are so neatly 
expressed that they pass from mouth to mouth, from gen- 
eration to generation. The best proverbs are true and 
witty; some are witty, but not true; some are true, but 
not witty; a few even neither true nor witty; but they 
always have "salt," the quality which gives zest and pre- 
serves from decay. Once heard they are remembered, how- 
ever bad our memory. They live after their origin, often 
after their meaning, is lost. They make us think ; they make 
us laugh; they recall a place or character, a custom or a 
word, which otherwise might be forgotten. They have the 
flavour of antiquity yet the freshness of novelty. A new 
proverb is a paradox, almost an impossibility. Its birth must 
be distant before its life is assured. 

Not long ago a widely-circulated author, whose volumes 
lay on the tables of well -furnished drawing-rooms, where 
books were never read, wrote many thousand verses, called 
* Proverbial Philosophy,' but Mr Martin Tupper never 
succeeded in making a proverb. The first living novelist 
in the opinion of good judges has a commonplace-book of 
unborn proverbs, which he brings out at intervals in his 
thoughtful novels, but these apothegms are skipped by the 
readers and forgotten even by the admirers of Mr George 
Meredith. Mr Andrew Lang has propounded the heresy 
that any one can make a proverb. Let him try. It is as 
difficult to make a proverb as a parable. One of the best 
known Scottish sayings is that of Fletcher of Saltoun — 
" I knew a very wise man who believed if a man were per-

mitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should 
make the laws of a nation." It could not have run, If a 
man were permitted to make all the proverbs. Proverbs are 
the property of no one, or rather of every one, and have 
become the common stock of the people. They require an 
occasion, and their quality largely depends on the frequency 
of their recurrence, or of some other apt case when, as the 
proverb itself says, "the cap fits." 

" The Kingdom " has a good soil for proverbs. Its 
separate bounds between the striking natural frontiers of 
the Sea, the Firths, and the Ochils, have contained since 
early times so many centres of different kinds of work, 
thought, and speech. At Kirkcaldy, for example, the pro- 
gressive town of the East Coast, we are separated from 
the quaint old burgh of Dysart, the Little Holland of the 
seventeenth century, only by Lord Rosslyn's grounds, within 
which the ruins of Ravenscraig, resisting even neglect and 
decay, witness to the strong architecture built to resist the 
new artillery. We are not far from the Caves of Wemyss, 
which were the homes of the first Christians, afterwards the 
haunts of smugglers, and served in the seventeenth century 
as the first Glass -Work of Scotland. Hard by are the 
fragments of the ruined tower of the old Earls of Fife. 
Within a few miles inland still stand the ruins of the Castle 
of Balwearie, and its fine trees with branches like stags' horns, 
where Michael Scot, the most famed wizard of Scotland after 
Thomas of Ercildoune, lived. Some stones may still be seen 
of the Grange, from which the gallant soldier who derived 
his name from the town was better known as the Laird of 
Grange. We are surrounded by the more recent memories 
of the salt-pans, mills, brew-houses, and havens, the spin- 
ning and weaving villages which have grown into prosperous 
seats of manufacture. Or let us change the scene from the 
shores of the Forth to the banks of the Tay. At Newburgh

"THE kingdom" a PROVERB. 263 

we are within walking distance of Abernethy, with its vener- 
able Round Tower, the ancient seat of Pictish kings and 
bishops ; of Auchtermuchty, once a small but wealthy agri- 
cultural township, then a thriving weaving town, whose 
looms are now nearly silent ; of the half ruined Palace and 
the buried Tower of Falkland ; of Freuchie, once despised 
by Falkland, on whose decay it now looks down; and of 
Auld Lindores, with its deserted cloister but living orchards. 
Each of these, and many other places throughout the county, 
have special and varied characteristics of the past, with a 
separate life even to-day which raise reflections and give birth 
to proverbs. 

Without taking the licence of our Gaelic kin, who call 
every quaint saying a proverb, it is better not to limit our- 
selves to any strict definition. We shall not count it either 
necessary or enough that it should be a good saying, — what 
the French, who are adepts in such sayings, call a mot or bon 
mot But we shall be satisfied if it is short and pithy, and 
remembered by the people. This last is the test of the 
proverb, that it lives in the memory and on after occasions 
comes to the lips of the people. It loses, like a good story, 
some of its flavour when it is written down, yet the herbarium 
has its use as well as the garden. 

It is natural to begin with what concerns the whole county. 
The Kingdom is itself very nearly, if not quite, a proverb. 
It would be rejected by the scientific collector, but comes 
within the more popular description here adopted. It cer- 
tainly possesses most of the qualities. It is old, it is brief, 
it is never forgotten, its origin is lost. We have historical 
knowledge of the Earl and the Sheriff, and poetical, though 
not historical, knowledge of the Thane of Fife of whom 
Tennant sung. But when and where within its bounds was 
there a single King who held it as his Kingdom? There 
have been Kings of Scotland, or of the Scots, who have

264 A FIFER NOT FAR FROM A HIGHLANDMAN. 

built castles and palaces, and lived and died in Fife, but 
they never were called Kings of Fife. There were before 
them in the dim distance Pictish kings of whom we know 
scarcely more than the names, a few doubtful dateS and un- 
intelligible epithets, the Drusts, and Brudes, and Nechtans ; 
but to none of these has the title of King of Fife been 
given in history. There were the old Celtic chiefs, the 
Macduffs, whom the Wemysses claim to represent, who 
became its Earls. They boast an ancient lineage, and would 
gladly, like an Irish M*Dermot or 0*Connell, believe they had 
a King as a progenitor, but they have never found one in 
their genealogies, however laboriously constructed. Fife must 
be content to be a Kingdom without a King. It may be one 
of the eccentricities of Fife that the inhabitants are fond of 
the name of "The Kingdom." Yet it is a common bond. 
It might be a toast, as the ^^Aucht- and -forty Davachs of 
Huntly^' in Aberdeenshire, ^^ The Sons of CIach-?ui'Cudden" 
in Inverness, or "^4// Round tJie IVrekin " in Shropshire. It 
means the county and all the good people in it. 

These good people have given themselves the name of 
Fifers^ which also just misses being a proverb in the strict 
sense, and expresses, perhaps, as much of their character as 
six letters can. West Country folk call the Fifer " the 
Whistler," with a half-punning, half- ironical reference. It 
would be rash to attempt to translate either into long-winded 
English. There is a proverb, however, which makes the attempt, 
and one which carries a good deal of forgotten history — 

" To be a Fifer is not far from being a Ilighlandman" 

Was it a proud Gael who first uttered this proverb, which may 
seem to imply that the F'ife man was not quite so good as a 
Highlander? or was it a douce Edinburgh citizen of the 
days when a Highlander was deemed either a robber or a

CELTIC CHARACTER IN FIFE. 265 

beggar, and no welcome sight in the Southern city ? Or is the 
more correct form of the saying, 

""^ If you're Heelant you're next door to the Fifer'' ? 

in which case it may be feared the conceit belongs to the Fife 
side of the Highland border, to the same pride which dictated 
the proverb, 

" TAey that sup with Fife folk maun hae a lang spune^' 

which, however, is only a common proverb of the pawky 
Scot, adapted specially for use in Fife ; but as " Fife folk " 
are substituted for " The Deil '' in the common proverb, per- 
haps the Fife version is ironical. Is it to the Highlander or 
the Lowlander that we should attribute another scornful say- 
ing about Fife ? 

" Fairweel bonny Scotland^ Fm awa' to Fife'' 

Apart from these fancies, the sayings which attribute to the 
people of Fife something of the Highland or Celtic character 
preserve in proverbial form the fact written at large on the 
topography, that the population of a district, as a whole 
Lowland rather than Highland, was originally Celtic, speak- 
ing a dialect of the Gaelic tongue, honouring the Celtic 
saints, using the old Celtic ritual, following the customs of 
the old Celtic law as at Markinch or the sanctuary at 
Macduff's Cross, wearing the Celtic garb, playing the 
pipes, and singing to their tunes. The dress which still 
lingers in the Highlands might be seen in Fife almost 
down to the present time. The white frilled mutch was 
worn by the old women, the homespun -frieze by the men. 
The bonny lassies drew the snooded shawl over their fair 
hair, and the braw lads cocked their bonnets when they 
went to woo, till the last generation introduced London 
or Paris hats and bonnets. The piper was to be found in

266 HIGHLAND DRESS IN FIFE— FIFE LAIRDS. 

many of the towns, and young and old danced the Highland 
Fling or Strathspey when he played on Falkland Green or 
Anster Loan. Shan-trews, a characteristic Highland dance, 
was danced at Strathmiglo at least down to the beginning of 
the present century. All this is, or is becoming, ancient 
history, only fit to be embalmed in old proverbs. No part 
of Scotland save the Lowlands proper seems now less akin to 
the Gael or less familiar with his peculiar usages. Yet when 
we penetrate beneath the surface, in spite of the settlement 
of many Saxons and Normans, some Danes and Flemings, 
and perhaps a few Dutchmen, there remains in the Fife 
character its humour and queerness, its clannishness and 
attachment to the soil, — something which in a measure, 
though in a decreasing measure, justifies the proverb that to 
be a F'ifer is not so far off from being a Highlandman. Who- 
ever studies the faces and figures in Wilkie's " Pitlessie Fair " 
or " The Rent Day " will ask himself more than once whether 
he is not looking at men and old women of Celtic race. 
Their dress is that which has lingered longer in Ireland, but 
is passing away there too, — not the older plaid of the ancient 
Celt, but the queer mixed garb he assumed, partly in imita- 
tion of a later phase of southern fashion, partly as a survival 
of the old custom of his forbears, the tall hat, the tail-coat, 
the knee-breeches, and the clouted shoes or brogues. A 
great artist, like a great poet, often sees farther than an 
ordinary man. 

The Fife Lairds of a bygone day were known in Princes 
Street before a bridge spanned the Forth, or in the High 
Street before there was any Princes Street, by the salt water 
on their hats, and were the subject of many proverbs, of 
which the best describes their estates — 

^^ A puckle landy a lump of debt ^ a doocot^ and a law plea ^'^

and the worst satirises them as 

" Aye daft and maistly drunk^ and what they want in 
sense they have in greed, ^^ 

But Lady Nairne makes a humorous apology for the Fife 
Laird in one of her songs : — 

** Ye shouldna ca* the Laird daft, tho* daft-like he may be ; 
Ye shouldna ca' the Laird daft, he's just as wise as we ; 
Ye shouldna ca' the Laird daft, his bannet has a bee ; 
He's just a wee bit FiBsh, like some Fife Lairds that be/' 

After the county the capital claims place. Of all the 
proverbs of Fife, 

" Wha will to Cupar maun to Cupar'' 

has probably had the widest circulation. It certainly has the 
merit of antiquity. If it had been made in modern times 
it might perhaps have run the other way, " Who won't to 
Cupar won't to Cupar'' We have become in some respects 
less active than our forefathers. In the days of the Jameses 
and Queen Mary no one thought anything about a walk or 
a ride from Dunfermline or Falkland to Kirkcaldy or Cupar. 
But now in this faster age of railways, if in Fife we may 
yet call it a faster age, Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy have 
their own courts, Leven desires one ; Auchtermuchty and 
Newburgh, and even Anstruther and St Andrews, like to 
settle their own small debts, of which fortunately there are 
few, within sight of their own doors. It is generally assumed 
that this, proverb has something to do with the resort to 
Cupar as the seat of justice. George Buchanan expresses 
this view when he describes Cupar as " a place in the 
middle region of the county where the rest of the people 
of Fife go to get justice." This also is assumed in a

268 "WHA WILL TO CUPAR." 

popular addition to the proverb, " JV/ia will to Cupar maun 
to Cupar''— 

" Aye better gang than be taen'' 

If, as the last suggestion implies, the proverb had a special 
reference to the penalties of the law, the Prison Commis- 
sioners have falsified it. No one can now by going to Cupar 
find lodgings there at the Queen's expense. Yet it was a 
proverb in Fife, 

" There is nae shamming in Johnny Brand's house " 

(a name for Cupar Jail, from the name of one of its jailers), 
which is perhaps not so applicable to the larger prisons of 
Edinburgh or Glasgow, Ayr or Dundee, or the Penitentiary 
of Perth. .Such readings of the proverb are surely much 
too limited. Perhaps the true meaning is, "Whoever sets 
his heart on going to the capital, be it London, Dublin, or 
Edinburgh, or in the Kingdom of Fife to Cupar, will manage 
to get there, whether bent on business or pleasure." It is 
the local variety of the English proverb, " The wilful man 
will have his way" But it is superior to the English saying, 
because it does not exclude women, who sometimes get their 
own way. It has, besides, the advantage of the good old 
Scotch word " maun," which it may preserve after it has been 
lost in common speech. It is a word which expresses a good 
deal more than " will " or even than " must," and, like many 
words of the Scots vernacular, cannot easily be turned into 
English. And so this proverb requires a second English pro- 
verb, " Where there is a will there is a tvay,'' to express the 
Fife one. It conveys the hint that whoever wishes. to go to 
Cupar or any other place must take the means of getting 
there on foot if he cannot ride. Whatever it means, may 
Cupar long keep the distinction of this proverb. A kingdom 
may exist without a king, and become a republic. No country

or county can well exist without a centre, in which men from 
different parts have a common meeting -place, from which 
intelligence comes and goes, and in which authority has its 
seat. It need not be the richest or the busiest place. It 
is often difficult to decide between rival claims. It is well 
when it is settled, as in Fife, by a proverb. 

Cupar has a place in another proverb, which recalls one of 
the chief industries of Fife — 

" Auchtermuchty^ Auchtermuchty^ payment by piece : 
Cupar d Fife^ Cupar o^ Fife, payment by time^ 

When did this saying originate? Possibly when the hand- 
loom was being superseded by the power-loom, and Auchter- 
muchty stuck to the old style, while Cupar began to adopt 
the new; or was Cupar in advance of the times, paying 
even its hand-loom weavers by the day? If the weavers of 
Auchtermuchty worked slowly, and on that account turned 
out perhaps all the better webs, its herds had an opposite 
character, for it was said of them — 

" Hindmest awa^ and first hame, like the herds of 
Auchtermuchty, " 

The binders of Blebo had a similar bad character for dila- 
toriness, which is preserved in the saying — 

** As far behind as the bands ters of Blebo, ^^ 

who were often out of sight of the shearers, especially 
when the shearers were paid by piecework and practised 
** kemping." 

Another proverb of the neighbourhood of Cupar is a 
puzzle which local inquiry has not helped to solve. Did 

" Springfield holidays " 

mean that in Springfield it was all holidays, or that there 
were no holidays ? or, as has been suggested, is it a modem

proverb which relates to the long, sad holidays spent in the 
asylum ? If so, it has lost its force, for improved treatment 
and higher skill have discovered that work is the best medi- 
cine to ward off and to cure the maladies of the mind. One 
sees in this case how a proverb may fail sometimes by excess 
of brevity, and the saying will die, or is perhaps already dead. 
The parish of Cults had a quaint proverb of its own — 

^^ Seek a hole for your sel\ like Tammas Youngs bairns ^ 

Tammas was a beadle in Cults, with a large family, who, 
after the wife had undressed the bairns, was wont to pitch 
them into the box-bed saying, "Seek a hole for yourser." 
It was an early education in the struggles for place in a 
world larger than a box-bed, yet which, after all, like a box- 
bed, is a limited area. Cameron parish had also its own 
temporary saying, scarcely worthy of the name of a proverb, 
when its minister was Mr Mair — 

" Cameron kirk is muckle^ but the minister is Mair ;^* 

and so had Monimail in the proverb, whose meaning is 
lost, — for we doubt if it was, as has been conjectured, the 
direction of Neil Gow to his dancing pupils at Cupar to get 
the awkward squad to face properly, — 

" Turn your tail to Tarvit and your face to Alonimail^ 

These proverbs, most likely half forgotten in Fife, have been 
sent me by Mr James Scott, from Valley Falls, Kansas, 
who describes himself as a laddie who " paidled in the 
burn at Cults." Another proverb of the spinning trade, 
the product perhaps of Dunfermline or Kirkcaldy rivalry, 
reproaches the cloth of Cupar — 

" As coarse as Cupar ham, three threads to a pund^ 
and each pund an oxterfull^

PROVERBS OF KIRKCALDY. 2/1 

Next to Cupar and its neighbourhood we may turn to its 
wealthier sisters of the east and west, Kirkcaldy and Dun- 
fermline. Kirkcaldy and its suburbs have produced as many 
proverbs as any locality in Fife. The ^^Lang Toon " has made 
itself into a proverb. " Kirkcaldy the sell o't," said Andrew 
Fairservice, " is as long as any town in England." There was 
some patriotic exaggeration in this claim, but Kirkcaldy is and 
has long been celebrated as the long town of Scotland. It is 
a proud boast, for most towns in Scotland are long rather 
than broad. The form in which the Scottish burgesses in 
old times built their burghs is indeed matter of more than 
antiquarian curiosity. It is a point in Scottish history. The 
old Scottish towns were not walled except Berwick and Perth, 
the frontier towns of the English and Highland borders. 
Edinburgh only built its wall after Flodden. There are no 
towns in Scotland like York or Chester, Roman camps which 
became fortified cities. The chief Scottish towns owed their 
defence to a castle which towered from its rocky eminence 
over the streets, as in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton, In- 
verness. They were protected also by their poverty, which 
made a Scottish town in old days hardly worth pillage. The 
burgh lay open to the country-side, where its citizens culti- 
vated their burgh acres, and combined rural with municipal 
pursuits. The houses were built fronting or gable-end to 
the main road, which became the High Street, running east 
and west or north and south, as the situation dictated. The 
houses had often common gables, a fertile source of lawsuits, 
and in other cases were separated by common entries or 
closes running to the back premises and connecting them 
with another street nearly parallel to the High Street, as the 
Cowgate of Edinburgh, through which the cows went from 
their byres to the town Meadows, or in the sea-coast towns 
leading to the margin of the sea, and often called The Shore.

272 WHY SCOTTISH BURGHS BUILT LONG. 

Population and trade increasing, the coveted sites were those 
which fronted or entered on the High Street. New building 
was either upwards, as in the Edinburgh tenements, called 
lands, partly because the flats were modelled after the French 
e/ages, but chiefly owing to the High Street being restricted to 
the short mile between the Canongate and the Castle. In 
Kirkcaldy, where there was no such limitation, the buildings 
gradually stretched along the High Street, on both sides of 
the Market Cross and the harbour. Another cause common 
to many towns, but especially noticeable in Kirkcaldy, which 
directed the lengthening of the line of building, instead of 
making cross streets and squares, was that the town lay on 
an ancient sea- level or raised beach, the narrow strip of flat 
ground between the sea, to which easy access was advan- 
tageous, and the brae or hillside beyond. And so it came 
about that Kirkcaldy is pre-eminently T^e Lang Toon, De- 
termined to deserve the name acquired when it was a fishing 
and shipping port before and a manufacturing town after the 
Union, but still only a little more than a mile long in the 
beginning of the eighteenth century, it is now three or four, 
and has absorbed Sinclairtown, Pathhead, and Gallatown, In- 
verteil and Linktown, and may some day absorb Dysart. The 
fame of its staple trade has spread over the Continent and 
across the Atlantic. But what might not be so readily ex- 
pected, it is also known abroad by one of its proverbs. When 
the German historian Pauli, whose head was as full of know- 
ledge as his heart of kindness, was on a visit to Edinburgh, 
his host. Professor Lorimer, invited him to Fife, saying, with 
a laugh, " I don't believe you know that county or anything 
about Kirkcaldy, the most famous of its East Coast towns." 
" Don't I," said Pauli, " don't I," with a twinkle of his bright 
eye,— 

" * Some say the deiVs deid and buried in Kirkcaldy I ' 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



OTHER SAYINGS OF KIRKCALDY. 273 

and its growth has been due to the deiPs constant complaint, 
*My taes is cauld, my taes is cauld,' which could only be 
silenced by more building." A various reading of the two 
last lines was — 

" Some say he's up again 
Tofley the Hieland Laddie,'' 

These were applied to the Duke of Cumberland, and very 
likely invented for the purpose after CuUoden. Whatever may 
be the other merits of this saying or the virtues of Kirkcaldy, 
this must be counted, it may be feared, one of the proverbs 
which are not true. A doubt is perhaps intended to be ex- 
pressed by the " some say " of the proverb. Or is Kirkcaldy 
more fortunate than the rest of the world in having buried 
the great adversary of man? Scarcely, if another saying is 
veracious, that a stranger, hearing the text, from the Psalms, 
read by Mr Shirra, its well-known Secession minister, " I said 
in my haste all men are liars," the stranger, or in one account 
of the story Shirra himself, exclaimed — 

''^Ay^ Dauvid^ had ye been in the Lang Toon ye micht 
hae said it at your leisure'' 

But this probably was the malice of some one who had made 
a bad bargain in the market. Another form of the addition 
to this proverb casts doubt upon the reality of the Devil's 
death and burial, for it proceeds — 

" Some say the deiVs up again and dancing Highland 
Laddie:' 

Surely this must have been the version of some stem Cove- 
nanter or sour Whig, who applied it to Prince Charlie as Sir 
Walter Scott applied it to Napoleon after his escape from 
Elba. Another proverb of Kirkcaldy relates to an incident 
of the time when the cross, which may now be seen on many

274 PROVERBS OF PATHHEAD. 

Established and even " the bonny U.P." kirks of which Mr 
Stevenson writes, was deemed idolatrous — 

" Kirkcaldy puir people 
Took down the cross to build the steeple ^ 

But this reproach was not peculiar to Kirkcaldy. The Cross 
of Cupar has been removed from the market-place to the 
Hill of Tarvit, and the Cross of Edinburgh was till lately cast 
among the rubbish at the base of St Giles'. 

Pathhead, the chief continuation of Kirkcaldy, seems to 
have been an object while it continued separate of jealousy 
both to its town and country neighbours. Such, at least, 
seems the drift of several proverbs which attached to it. 

" You're like Fath/iead folk, you look long afore you ^'^ 

is one of these, and is explained by some to mean that the 
people of that town thought themselves shrewder than they 
were, and by others that they anticipated the Hansel Monday 
holiday before it came due. 

" You II come down tJie hill yet, likt PathJuad folk,'' 

is a plainer saying, reflecting on their local situation and fail- 
ures in business, and hinting that they would need to come 
down to Kirkcaldy for help. There remains the most myste- 
rious of the local proverbs of P'ife — 

" Pickletillem to Pathhead, 
Ilka Bailie burns anither^ 

The first line refers to a farm of that name in the neighbour- 
hood of Pathhead, and is one word, not three words, as Mr 
Robert Chambers prints it, which gave rise to many misleading 
guesses. Such a guess is the explanation that the proverb 
applies to the Pathhead nailers, who could not make out 
their quota of work without getting a pickle added. But

PROVERBS OF DUNFERMLINE. 2/5 

what the second line means is a greater puzzle, which must 
be left to local antiquaries, with the remark of Mr Chambers, 
that "the meaning of the reproach is beyond reach, but 
till a late period its effect in irritating the good people of 
Pathhead was indubitable." 

Dunfermline is not so well off for proverbs as Kirkcaldy, 
though it produced, as we have seen, the first of many collec- 
tions of Scottish proverbs, but it is curious that very few of 
Ferguson's proverbs have a local colour. One saying of Dun- 
fermhne origin, 

" The deil has cussin his cloke aboot the bairn^^ 

is said to have been spoken by James VI. when the nurse of 
Charles I. awoke him with a tale of an apparition beside the 
cradle of his child. That monarch, who was so proud of his 
good sayings, would no doubt prefer to be remembered by the 
better known one describing the county as 

"^ beggar's mantle with a fringe of gold''* 

Mr Addison, of the * Stourbridge Advertiser,' to whom I am 
indebted for a friendly communication, recalls another saying, 

"/*// nd tak affmy breeks till I gang to my bed" 

as current in Dunfermline ; and he adds others as well known 
to him in his young days in that town. Some of them are 
common elsewhere, but the following is worth preserving, 
which was said of a braggart or boaster — 

" Your wind shakes nae corn ; "

276 PROVERBS OF FALKLAND. 

which may be compared with the English, " Look before you 
leap:' 

A very brief proverb is 

''Torryburn Hail,'' 

which is a modern Dunfermline saying for a one-sided game, 
as the Torryburn lads usually win in the shinty matches. 

" Ye' re no' aye gaun to the kirk when ye gang doon the 
Kirkgate" 

is another perhaps not exclusively applicable to Dunfermline. 
Two proverbs of the weaving trade are remembered by old 
residents of Dunfermline — 

^^He'll neither hap nor wind," 
and 

^''Keep a hasp in your ain hand" 

which sufficiently explain their meaning. Another from the 
same trade probably originated in one of the small villages, 
or may have been the saying of a farmer with a thriftless 
housewife — 

"77/tf thrift 0' you and a dog's woo would mak a braw wab" 

The advice of an old farmer in the Dunfermline district to 
his labourers is still quoted — 

^^ Be stuffy ; if ye dinna be stuffy, be as stuffy as ye can." 

They called him from it " Old Stuffy." 

If Dunfermline itself has comparatively few proverbs, Falk- 
land, the other Royal Palace of Fife, makes up for it. Most 
of its proverbs are allusions to the Court and courtiers. 

''To be Falkland bred" 

meant to be a courtier. 

" You're queer folk no' to be Falkland folk" 

was the retaliation of some witty country-bred man to a set

of people he knew quite well hailed from Falkland, and who 
were giving themselves airs. 

"Togo to Freuchie and^^ as .is sometimes added, ^^ fry frogs ^^^ 

was to get into disgrace and be banished from Court The 
addition may possibly refer to this fate having befallen a 
French favourite. It is the Scotch for " To be sent to Coventry^' 
like the North Country proverb " To go to Banff and buff ben* 
leather, ^^ or the Newcastle malediction, " Go to Hexham,^^ 

" You won't cut the woods of Falkland with a penknife^^ 

is a saying which must be of early date, before its fine trees, 
which had escaped the demands of the Scottish Navy, had 
fallen under the axes of the soldiers of Cromwell and of 
Charles. It is to be found in Ferguson*s collection. 

" The king may come the cadger's gate " 

is probably a proverb of Falkland origin, and may be taken 
in more than one sense. 

"Like is an ill mark " 
is said to be a proverb of Falkland, a warning against the use 
of comparisons, parallels, and similes, perhaps because its 
natives did not care to be compared to those of any other 
place ; but it is sometimes quoted, 

"Uke's an ill mark among itherfoWs sheep^^ 

which makes it a saying of the shepherds of the Lomonds or 

the Ochils. When Falkland had fallen from its high estate 

as the Royal Court it still retained its municipal honours. 

The 

"Bailies coo;' 

if not a proverb, deserves to be one. Her master, when he 
visited her byre, somewhat elevated after his election as a 
Falkland Bailie, greeted her, "Ah, Crummie, Crummie, ye're 
nae common coo now ; ye're a Bailie's coo, my man," or, as

278 PROVERBS OF DYSART. 

it is sometimes told, " my kddie " ; but " my man " appears 
better suited to her master*s condition and mental confusion. 

^^Like draws to like^^ 

is one of the proverbs which is the common property of many 
places and countries. But the addition, 

^^Like an auld horse to a fail [feal] dyke^^ 

gives it a peculiar Scottish, perhaps Fifish, turn. 

" Blood without stiet mak^s puir ptuUins^^ 
and 

^^ Better half an egg than a toom doup^^ 

are two proverbs of the kitchen which w^ere current in Fife, 
and belong to the cottage, not to the palace. 

It may be convenient to note the proverbs of the other 
East Coast towns before crossing to Tayside or making an 
excursion into the interior of the county. Dysart at one 
time came next to Kirkcaldy in the currency of its proverbs, 
though they are for the most part now antiquated. 

^^As old as the three trees of Dysart^'' 

was remembered when there was only one, but now it is 
gone, and the saying is probably forgotten. 

" Salt to Dysart;' 
the Scotch form of " Coals to Ne^vcastle^' is at least as old as 
1583, when it appears in James Melville's 'Autobiography,' 
and has lost its meaning now the salt-pans are abandoned. 

" A puir appearance for Dysart I " 
was the exclamation of the drunken sexton when awakened 
by the side of a grave he ought to have been digging by the 
mail-guard's horn, which he took for the last trumpet, and 
himself for the only representative of his town. The humour 
of this proverb has led to its being borrowed by Kirkintilloch

PROVERBS OF KINGHORN. 279 

and perhaps other places. It was recalled to the writer by a 
Highland shepherd, who told the tale that when wintering his 
sheep in Fife he found a very well-dressed man asleep by 
a ditch-side. It was the time of an election, and after the 
drunkard was roused from his slumbers, he could only mutter, 
" I am a Z^^beral, I am a Z^^beral." Was this in vino Veritas, 
or the opposite, like the London medical student who, on a 
similar occasion, informed the police he was Mr Wilberforce. 
Whatever way you take it, let us hope it will never become 
a proverb. Fife has indeed no political proverbs, though 
Kinross has the celebrated non-political one — 

" Happy is the man who belongs to no party, 
Who sits in his ain house and looks at Benarty,^^ 

This declaration is more likely to have been made by Malcolm 

of Loch Or, an old Kinross laird who lived at the time of the 

French Revolution, when thrones were shaken and British 

parties split asunder, than by Sheridan, who has sometimes 

been credited with it as an impromptu uttered when he was 

on a visit to Blairadam. 

Dysart did not confine itself to salt, and a rhyming proverb 

runs — 

** Dysart for coal and saut, 

Pathheadfor meal and maut, 

Kirkcaldy for lasses braw, 

Kinghorn for breaking the law,^* 

Kinghorn, for what reason is not clear, perhaps because it 
was the poorest of the royal burghs of the East Coast, seems 
to have had a bad name in the days of old proverbs, for 
another lame rhyme goes — 

^^ Kinghorn for cursing and swearing, 
Burntisland for curing herring,^* 

But as Burntisland no longer cures, it may be hoped Kinghorn 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



28o PROVERBS OF WEMYSS, 

no longer curses. Nor was the place better thought of than 
the people. The fishers despised its bay for its poverty in 
fish, and said of it — 

" Kinghorn Blind [/.tf., an enclosed bay] ; a muckle dish 
and little in it,'' 

or as another prosaic form has it — 

" Ifs like Kinghorn, nae muckle worths 

Its better behaved neighbours declared its sins in the lines — 

" Here stands a kirk without a steeple, 
A drucken priest and a graceless people'' 

And the passenger seems to have fought shy of its ferry, for 
it was said, 

" Therms many speir the road for Kinghorn and ken it a' the 
way to Petty cur." 

Or was this a jest at the kind of people we all know who go 
about asking useless questions ? 

" They keep open house at Kinghorn" 

was said when its houses had fallen into decay and let in as 
guests the wind and the rain. There is nothing, of course, in 
Kinghorn of the present day to justify these gibes, which its 
monument to the good King Alexander III. and new golf- 
course have, we may hope, banished for ever. No one from 
Kinghorn has for long appeared at the bar of the criminal 
court for any serious breach of the law. 

At Wemyss a caustic saying was in common use — 

"Z&gt;«7 stick pride ! my doug deid o't," 

which was applied to foppish and conceited people. The 
dog is a favourite character in Scottish proverbs, and in the 
neighbourhood of Pittenweem it was a common remark — 

" You're a speering dog, like auld Sir Robert."

PROVERBS OF EAST NEUK. 28 1 

Most proverbs, especially local ones, are, as these examples 
show, satirical, and often slightly malicious ; but they occa- 
sionally pay compliments, as in the well-known lines — 
" The canty carls o' Dysart^ 
The merry lads 6* Buckhavetty 
The saucy kimmers d Largo, 
The bonny lasses d Leven'^ 
The original of this was a boat song which Burns honoured 

by copying — 

*' Up wi' the carls o* Dysart, 
And the lads o' Buckhaven, 
And the kimmers o' Largo, 
And the lasses o* Levcn." 

" Hey ca* thro*, ca* thro*, 
For we hae muckle to do.*' 

The last lines were the refrain of the singers as they kept 
time to the tune with their oars, which remind us of the finer 
lines of Hugh Ainslie's song, " The Rover of Loch Ryan " — 

" We have roared thro* a heavier sea, my boys, 
And we'll roar thro* a heavier yet." 

The lads of Buckhaven were perhaps merry because they 
had little to do with books, and to be bred at the 

" College of Buckhaven " 

was even a byword for an ignorant man. It referred to the 
old schoolhouse, which still stands, and may have been the 
school where " Wise Willie " and " Witty Eppie " of the well- 
known chapbook got their learning. The Buckhaven fishers, 
however, knew their own business, and prospered in it It 
was said in the beginning of last century that there was not a 
poor man in the village. They have kept up this character 
now that they are more learned by building their harbour at 
their own cost without borrowing. Why the Leven lasses 
were preferred to those of Largo, or why Dysart had only

282 TROVERBS OF CRAIL. 

canty carls and no merry lads, it would be rash to conjec- 
ture. There is a longer rhyme which commemorates the 
young ladies of the East Coast fishing towns : — 

" The lasses d the Ferry [Earlsferry], 

They busk braw; 
The lasses o* f/ie Eiie, 

T/iey ding a\' 
The lasses o* St Monan, 

They adrse and ban ; 
The lasses d Fiitenweem^ 

They do the same ; 
The lasses o^ Anster, 

They drink strong ale ; 
There's green grass in Cellardyke 

And crabs in till Crail^ 

Crail still claims to have the best crabs on the coast. It is 
the last of the sea towns distinguished by many proverbs, 
though a few others may be gleaned. 

St Andrews has apparently no proverbs, unless we may 
credit it with 

" The reek of Patrick Hamilton infects all it blatvs on J*' 

It was perhaps too learned, and the other towns of the coast 
are much richer in such sayings. 

The quaint burgh of Crail has several to mark its out-of-the- 
world character. 

''A Crail capon'' 

was a haddock smoked in the chimney-lum, the most plentiful 
kind of food in that remote quarter, of which it is related that 
one Fife man asked another whether he had been abroad who 
replied, 

" Na ; but I a nee kent a man who had been to Crail ^

■ RHYMES AND SAYINGS ABOUT CRAIL. 283 

" Crailplay " 
at whist, to lead Ace King in succession, is the same as 
^^ Paisley play ^^^ in Hke manner looked down upon by Glasgow 
players. It was a mode which the more skilful new-fashioned 
players of Anstruther and Pittenweem despised. 

"-4 Januat^ haddock^ 
A Februat^ bannock^ 
And a March pint of ale ^^ 
is another saying of the East Coast without specific locality. 

Two of the rhymes of the lofts in the old kirk of Crail may 
here find a place, though the second is too long for a proverb, 
and neither probably is peculiar to Crail. That of the 
hammermen runs — 

" With hammer in handy 
All arts do standi' 

While the tailors boast — 

" This ancient trade, since Adam was a rebel. 
Justly deserves the head of all the table ; 
For first in Paradise it did begin, 
Which minds us all of our original sin. 
But since that time the case has altered so, 
Were it not for tailors we might all naked go y 

A better specimen of Crail poetry is the epitaph in the kirk- 
yard — 

" Of doughty Douglas kind he came, 

And so he did well prove; 
He lived always in guid fame. 
And died in all men^s love^ 

The sea has its proverbs, mostly sad, as the well-known 

warnings —

which is sometimes varied to the form — 

"JJ^a ship miss the Car this year, she'll hit twice the next." 

The directions for a voyage from Queensferry to the Tay 
were summed up in the lines — 

^'^ Inchcolmy Inchkeith, 
The twa Mickeries and Craigleithy 
The lofty Bass and the Isle of May, 
Round the Car and in the Tay" 

The fishers of Pittenweem had a mark for finding a place 
where fish were plenty, which, though scarcely a proverb, may 
yet be quoted. They had found it when — 

" Kellie Laixfs tap could be seen in line with the steeple cross, 
and Charlie NicoVs west room window" 

Another saying, more like a proverb, well describes the 

custom of the fisher-wives baiting the hooks and selling the 

fish— 

" A ivoman suld na wed 

Till she can win her man^s bread" 

The saying common round all the coast of " Piscosa 
Scotia" is often quoted in Fife — 

" Gie your ain fish-guts to your ain sea-maws" 

The North Coast has fewer small towns, so fewer proverbs, 
but the neighbourhood of Newburgh has preserved some, 
which have a more ancient taste than those of the East Its 
schoolboys still cry, 

" Gey to Hackle Birnie," 

from " Hackel-barend," the Norse spirit of the storm (Laing's 
* Lindores,' p. 378); and their elders still repeat to each 
other, 

" The bells of the Abbey ivill aye be gotten rung"

PROVERBS OF LINDORES, ABERNETHY, NEWPORT. 28$ 

This warning, that every place can be easily filled up, is said 
to have originated as a reflection on a bumptious bellringer 
of Lindores who thought himself indispensable. It is 
remembered now in its transferred meaning when there 
are neither Abbey nor bells. It is the local counterpart of 
many similar sayings, as the classic line, " Uno avuiso non 
deficit alter aureus " / or the English proverb, " There are as 
good fish in the sea as ever came out of it" of which the 
Scottish version is, 

" There are more kale in Kinross than ever came out of it," 

" He that can do no better must needs be a monk" 

is a saying ascribed by tradition to the ninth Earl of Douglas, 
and probably a proverb before his time, when sent to end 
his days as a prisoner in the Abbey; and, though the tradi- 
tion is doubted by modern writers, it seems consistent with 
the character of the proud baron who had defied the king. 
Abernethy has the queer saying — 

" He's nd a wrong man for a^ the beast" 

which we have seen was derived from Mr Matthew Moncrieff, 
the Seceder minister, hunting a hare on the Sabbath, but has 
been transferred in its common use to any one who, though 
subject to some failing, is a good sort of a person on the whole. 
There was a scoffing saying about Newport, belonging to 
the time when its whole population consisted of the ferrymen 
and their families — 

" Take care what you say about neighbours at Newport^ — 
They are all Uncles and Aunties and Cousins" 

This is a proverb which applies to other places, but its 
prudent counsel has seldom been followed.

of other districts are weather prophecies, common signs on

the universal subject that interests every one, but no class 
more than an agricultural community, which has to win its 
livelihood in a changeable climate. Such is the rhyme of 
the East Coast — 

" JFAen Largo Law the mist doth bear. 
Let Kellie Law for storms prepare ;^^ 

or another of the central districts — 

" When Falkland Hill puts on his cap^ 
T/ie Howe of Fife ivill get a drap ; 
And when the Bishop draws his cowl, 
Ij)ok out for wind and weather foul ;^^ 

both of which recall other proverbs of the mist, as 

^^ Mist on the hills weather spills ; 
Mist in the howes, weather grows, ^^ 

•* When Monifnail Hill puts on its hat^ 
The Buchan Hotves 7vill pay for that^ 

" When the mist comes to the hills ^ 
Ye' II get water for your mills; 
IF/ien the mist comes from t/ie sea^ 
Fair weather it will be,^^ 

The cold weather of the high ground inland from the E^st 
Neuk, and swept by winds both from the Forth and the Sea, 
has been reflected in proverbs, as in the rhyme — 

" LadoddiCy Fader nie, Lathockar^ and LatJwne^ 
Ye may saiv wV gloves aff^ and sJiear wV mittens on,^^ 

It was probably to the soil of this locality that the descrip- 
tion refers, 

^^ It greets a* winter and girns a^ simmer, ^^

So Carnbee has got the epithet of cauld in the saying,

though there are warm houses near it. But the close of it, 
sometimes varied to 

" Meikle wark and little fee" 

is now obsolete. Yet even this inclement district has sheltered 
places, for 

^^Blaw the wind tvhere it likes , 
There's bield about Pitmilly dykes:' 

The floods as well as the winds are the farmer's foes, and a 
useful warning is given to those whose lands lie along the Ore 
after it joins the Lothrie in the lines — 

" Colquhally and the Sillerton, 
Pitcairn and Dowhill, 
Should clear their haughs ere Lammas spates 
The Ore begins tofilW 

Those who live lower down the stream are more obscurely 
admonished of the need of an early harvest by the verse — 

''^ LochtiCy Lothrie, Leven, and Ore, 
Rin a' through Cameron Brig bore,'' 

or, as it has been altered to commemorate a local worthy, 
perhaps the miller at Cameron Bridge, 

''A' meet at Johnny Wisharfs door," 

That worthy deserves to have his name preserved in pro- 
verbial folk-lore, for he, as my friend Mr William Christie 
informs me, refused to sell his napkin of land for a good 
price, because he did not wish to lose the proverb.

their quaintness. If any one despises them, those of another

Commissioner Adam relates that the following Kinross-shire 
rhyme of the Ochils was a favourite — 

^^Locharnie and Locharni^s MosSy 
The Louten Stane and DodgiWs Cross, 
Craigencat and Craigencrow, 
Craigarnie, King^s Seat, and Duncrow.^^ 

With which we may match the Fife one —

Pittemveem and Anster, 

Crail and Arncroach,

This was indeed a common form of boasting at the expense 

of your neighbours, of which two other specimens may be 

given —

Talla-bout and Thomas-toun, Tarvit and Whitehill,

names and their pronunciation, and ought not to be neglected

CRACKS OR FLAMS. 289 

Some of these place-lines are more plain-spoken than polite, 

as — 

" Carriston and Preston^ 

Kirkforthar and the Drums, 

Were four as crabbed gentlemen 

As ever spak tvP tongues ; " 

or, as it was sometimes altered — 

" Were four as greedy farmers'^ 
So too — 

^^Lundie Mill and LargOy the Kirkton and the Keirs, 
Pittenweem an^ Anster are all big leears^'^ 
must have had a temporary personal application. 

One variety of saying consists of cracks or flams, humor- 
ous exaggerations, or "big lees" as the author of the last 
lines might have called them, a kind of wit in which our 
American kinsmen are now the chief masters. Such was 
the saying of David Lindsay of Wormestoune to an Anglo- 
Indian, who was drawing the long-bow — 

" When I was in India I swallowed an oyster as big 
as a Leith smack J^ 

Another kind expresses an impossibility, as one on the gold- 
fields of Fife — 

" If Balmain cock doesna craw, 
And if Tammie Norrie his horn doesna blaw, 
Pll show ye the gold mine on Largo Law ; " 

or the Fife version of the Greek Kalends, a date which never 

comes — 

" When the Bass and the Isle of May * 

Meet together on Mount Sinai" 

which is from Sir David Lyndsay's poems. 

There are a few proverbs connected not with places, but 
with persons, worth quotation and a word of comment. 

T

290 PROVERBS IN LYNDSAY AND WYNTOUN. 

" YouUl nd find that in Davy Lyndsay^^' 

was a proverb of the time when the works of the Lyon King 
were the secular Bible of the people of Fife. 

It is singular that so few proverbs are to be found in Lynd- 
say's poems, although his own name became proverbial, and 
many passages of his works were frequently quoted. Such 
proverbs as are to be found in them are of older date, as one 
which applies to more than one period of Scottish histor)-, and 
was verified in his lifetime — 

^^ I see right well that proverb is full true^ 
\Vd to the realm that has owre young ane King^ 

And another — 

^^ Hie^st in Court, neist the ividdie^' 

— /&gt;., nearest the gallows, of which he says, " This proverb is 
of the verity the quilk I heard red intill ane letter." 
Both he and Dunbar cite the ancient proverb of 

''''Blind A lane looking at the moon^' 

the explanation of which is lost. The saying that bishops who 
did not preach were 

''Dumb dogs;' 

which Knox adopted, was perhaps original, and so probably 
was the one already quoted of the meeting of the Bass and 
Isle of May on Mount Sinai. 

An older Fife author than Lyndsay, \Vyntoun, has preserved 
some proverbs which may be counted the earliest known say- 
iifgs of Fife, of which the following may serve as a sample : — 

^'Auld men in their proverbe say is, 
Pryde gays be/or and schame alwayis 
Folouys this on a I sa fast, 
And it owre-takis at the last.''

ROYAL PROVERBS. 29 1 

This is a proverb which all modern languages have borrowed 
or copied from the Latin — 

" Ubifuerit Superbia ibi erit Contumeliay 

" Wha labours nocht he sail not eat^^ 

is translated from the Vulgate. 

^^Ane sair saint for the Crown " 

was said by James I. of David I. when he saw Dunfermline, 
but became current from Lyndsay's quotation of it in " The 
Satyre of the Three Estates." 

The Stuart kings seem to have had a turn for proverb- 
making, perhaps derived from their residence in Fife. James 
III. died exclaiming, 

^^ I was your King this mornin'^ 

James IV. was the author of the inconsistent saying, 

^^Do weil and set not by deeming, „ 
For no man sail undeemit be" 

James V. died at Falkland with a proverb in his mouth, 

"// came with a lass, and it will go with a lass." 

The lass who was to wear the Crown did not make any pro- 
verb in the vernacular, though she was to be the occasion, or 
give the occasion, for the application of more than one, as 

^^They never get luck who come to Lochleven" 

and 

^^ Better women iveep than bearded nun" 

But, as was natural in one bred abroad, she preferred foreign 
proverbs. She embroidered, probably when a captive at 
Lochleven, a bed of State, with impresas (mottoes) and 
emblems, wrought with gold and silk, of which Drummond 
of Hawthornden sent a full description in a letter to Ben 
Jonson. This is a good precedent for the sport of proverb-

hunters, in which the two poets seem to have taken equal 
pleasure. These mottoes or devices are Latin, French, or 
Italian, most of them glancing at her own fate. There are 
too many for quotation, but one or two may be selected and 
translated 

^^ Hares insult the vanquished Hon^^ 

alluding to her captivity. 

"5^ bore ane^ but a lion^^ 

to her only son. 

"/« my end lies my beginning^^ 

the motto of her mother, Mary of Guise, which seems to be, 

as explained by its emblem, a phcenix rising from the flames, 

a version of the Latin "Mors janua vitae." The Scottish 

Solomon did not prove a lion, but, as was fitting, he was the 

author of many proverbs, of which those relating to Fife have 

been already quoted. 

A few other proverbs of persons less than royal deserve 

notice. 

" We are a' John Thomson^ s bairns^^ 

referred to some popular individual, a master of the games, 
the feast, or the hounds. Certainly John Thomson was a Fife 
man, though not the same as appears in another proverb — 
"7b be John Thomson's man " — which Ferguson tells us was 
said of an effeminate person, and Dunbar, nearly a century 
before Ferguson, applied to James IV. when he wished he 
was more under the influence of his wife, Margaret Tudor. 
John is said in the latter proverb to stand for Joan ; but both 
appear to be sayings whose origin is lost, which has the ad- 
vantage of allowing us to put our own meaning into them. 

There is a good one credited to Miss Wood of Elie, a 
descendant of the great Admiral of Largo—

PERSONAL AND HOUSE PROVERBS. 293 

''Hike a' things weiii;' 
said Maggie Wood of The Elie, 

''But gude things best,'' 

a capital summary of optimistic philosophy. Some inveterate 
bachelor must have been the author of the Fife verdict on 
matrimony — 

" They say in Fife, 
That next to nae wife. 
The best thing is a guid wife'' 

It is the canny but unsatisfactory verdict of Not proven. 

The use of proverbial devices was very common in the 
middle ages. It probably began with the mottoes associated 
with the armorial shield or crest devised by the heralds, and 
expressing the family character or some moral precept. The 
architect placed them on the walls, chimneypieces, doors, and 
ceilings of houses ; the painter on his pictures ; the carpenter 
on his furniture ; the student in the album in which his friends 
inscribed their names. Some quaint ones from the house of 
Earls Hall, the seat of the Bruces in the parish of Leuchars, 
recently restored by Mr R. Lorimer for its present owner, Mr 
Mackenzie, may serve as samples. They are on the wall of 
the gallery : — 

" A nice wyf and a back door oft maketh a rich man poor," 

" Give liberalie to needful folke," 

"Deny nane of them al." 

" For little thou knowest now in this lyf quhat chance may 
befaL" 

" Try and then trust, after give assurance ; but trust not or 
ye try for fear of repentance," 

"Be merry, glad, honest, and virtuous, for that stoppeth the

These sayings show how easy it is to miss making a pro- 
verb. Only the first can claim the character. The others 
are too long, too prosy, too moralising. They are maxims, 
not proverbs, and lack wit. But they are characteristic of 
one side of the Fife and Scottish character, that prudential 
morality of the canny Scot at which the cynical Englishman 
and the happy-go-lucky Irishman are both fond of jesting. 

The ploughmen at the hiring fairs had rhymes to denote 
their likes and dislikes for particular farms or farmers, and the 
fare they got from their masters, as in the jingle, which had 
many alterations to suit the case, of which the best known 
form describes the fares of the Kinross district — 

" Witches in the Watergate, 

Fairies in the Mill, 

Brosy lads o* Neviston, 

Can never get their filL 
Sma^ drink in the Punful, 

Crowdie in the kirk. 
Grey meal in Boreland 
Waur than ony dirt. 
Bread and cheese in the Easter Mains^ 
Cauld sowens in the Wester Mains, 
Hard heads in Hardeston, 

Quakers in the Pow ; 
The braw lasses d* Abdie 
Canna spin their ain tmvJ'' 

Or another of the Eastern district — 

" The new toun d Balchristie, 
Balcarras and the Brough, 
Cauldstream and Cuffabout, 

Dirt-pat Ha'; 
Bumhead and Ethernie 

Stand abune them a'."

PLACE AND CHILDREN'S RHYMES. 295 

These are places within two miles of Leven, and the rhyme 
very well describes their relative positions. 

The colliers, we may be sure, have many proverbs, but I 
have only got one — 

" A collier i\ born a fortnicht before his meat^^ 

alluding to the custom of buying provisions on a fortnight's 
credit till their wages were paid. 

The situation of the farms in the western parishes of 
Dunbog and Moonzie is denoted in the lines — 

^^Bambreich stands heich^ Higham in a howe^ 
Glenduckie in a dub^ and Moonzie on a knowe^ 

Moonzie has another rhyme about its kirk — 

" Gae ye east or gae ye wast^ 
Or gae ye ony way ye willy 
Ye will not get to Mqonzie kirk 
Unless ye gallop up the hilV 

The neighbouring county of Clackmannan has the prettiest 
rhyme of places — 

^^ Ohf Alva woods are bonnie^ 
Tillicoultry hills are fair ; 
But when I think d the bonnie braes o^ Menstrie 
It makes my heart aye sair,^^ 

The children of the cottagers have many rhymed sayings, 
a few of which may have a place for the old words they 
preserve — 

" Curly doddy, do my biddin. 
Soap my hoose and shool my middinJ^ 

When they hang up the rowan - berries strung with red 
thread to frighten the witches, they sing or say — 

" Rowan-berries and red thread 
Put the witches to their speed ; "

296 FAMILY SAYINGS. 

and when they go about as guisards at Christmas-time they 
repeat the lines — 

" My feefs cauld, my shoon^s thifi, 
Gies my cakes and let me rin^ 

In many parts of Scotland there were sayings, generally 
satirical, about particular families or clans, but there are few 
of these connected with Fife, in which the clan system early 
disappeared, and even great families were often dispersed. 
The only ones of this kind in Fife, perhaps, relate to the 
Lyndsays, the Leslies, and the Beatons — 

" The light Lyndsays,'' 

which is not a disparaging epithet as might appear, but an 
allusion to their agile conduct at Otterburn. 

" He chose the Gordons and the Grahams, 
With them the Lindsays light and gay. 

The Lindsays flew like fire about 
Till a' the affray was done." 

^'' Ask no questions of the Leslies'' 

is a darker saying. Does it refer to the question which the 
ill-fated Cardinal Beaton put to Norman Leslie before he 
received the answer of the dagger still preserved at Rothes ? 
His own family have an epithet almost proverbial from traits 
of beauty, which have come down to the present time — 

** The Beatofis' blue eyes and golden hair," 

But these are said to have been derived not from the Beaton 
blood, but from the marriage of John Beaton, second laird of 
Creich, with a daughter of John Hay, Provost of Dundee, a 
cadet of the Hays of Naughton. 

The proverbs of Fife, like its poetry, are as a rule comic, 
satirical, pungent, seldom tender or pathetic. They do not 
often rise high or go deep. They are rather chance shafts.

PATHETIC PROVERBS. 297 

which, taking flight at a happy moment, have hit the target 
and scored a mark. Occasionally, but rarely, they have been 
more, and express a pathetic or imaginative truth in a form 
worthy of a poet. Such is the charitable saying, 

" The mouse should not leave the awmry with a tear in her 

eer 

or the pathetic expression of the proud poverty of an old man 
whose talk, my informant, the late Dr Laing of Newburgh, 
told me, was largely made of proverbs. He owned but one 
cow and had lost his only son — 

" ril tie mine ain hose wi* mine ain gartans,' 

he said, and added — 

" Sell the coo to bury Tammie^ 

Another, too general for a specific Fife origin, but which is 
well known in Fife, is — 

" Tak tent in time 
Ere time be tintJ*^ 

To Fife certainly belongs the well-known proverb which 
James Ballantine expanded into a song — 

^^Ilka blade 0^ grass heps its ain drap 0^ dew^ 

Miss Stirling Graham of Duntrune, when an old lady, was 
introduced to Ballantine, and drew him to the light, saying, 
"I should like to see the man who wrote that line"; but 
Ballantine modestly disclaimed the authorship, and told her 
it was a Fife proverb. To appreciate it, an Englishman must 
remember that keps means in the Scottish dialect " catches," 
as a boy does a ball. Its reverse has also found a proverbial 
form in the East Neuk, and, like it, has been turned into a 
song — 

^^Ilka door-step has its ain slippy staneJ^

298 THE FINEST PROVERB OF FIFE. 

It is no discredit to the song-writer that the proverb is better 
than the song, carrying a fuller meaning in fewer words. It 
would spoil a saying as true to nature as to the more cheerful 
view of life to put the former, the finest of the proverbs of 
Fife, into a prosaic version. Who does not when he hears it 
see the dewy lawn on a morning in May, or when the other 
is quoted recall the haar and the east wind which damp for 
more than half the year the flags before the cottages of the 
East Neuk village?

The Border and the Highland or Jacobite minstrelsy, the

Ayrshire, and some other districts, have been published in 
well-known works; but we are not aware of any collection 
of the ballads or songs of Fife. They have a marked 
character of their own, and they present examples of some 
of the earliest and some of the latest which have become 
classical. They contain several, if not of the best, as to 
which opinions will always vary, yet certainly of the second 
best Scottish songs. " The Wyf of Auchtermuchty," " Christ's

300 CHARACTER OF FIFE MINSTRELSY. 

Kirk on the Green," " Sir Patrick Spens," " Lammikin," " The 
Bonny Earl of Moray," ** Hardyknute," and " Auld Robin 
Gray," will scarcely be matched by an equal number from any 
other county. Their styles are probably more various than 
in any other part of Scotland. While the comic vein pre- 
dominates, the historical, the pathetic, the tragic is also 
represented. 

Wyntoun was a chronicler in verse, not a poet, and James I. 
was only a king whom love led to stray amongst the poets. 
The earliest of the great Scottish poets, Blind Harry, was one 
of the many ballad-singers at the Court of the Stewart kings. 
Most of their names have perished. The deeds of Wallace 
changed his muse from the ballad to the epic, and gave 
Harry the Minstrel a share in the immortality of his hero. 
It is more than probable that he had begun by celebrating 
some of the deeds of Wallace as well as of other heroes in 
the form of songs. While Fife cannot claim either Blind 
Harry or Barbour as natives, it is noteworthy that the manu- 
script in which their works are preserved was written by a 
Fife man, John Ramsay of Lochmalonie, in the reign of 
James IV. The hall of Falkland often heard the minstrel's 
voice. William Dunbar also was a poet of the Court, and 
several of his poems have a local reference to Dunfermline 
or to Falkland, and may have been sung at either, though it 
is curious that the only music preserved is that for the poem 
in praise of London. 

It is not necessary to be precise in the definition of a bal- 
lad. It will suit the present purpose not to distinguish it, as 
has sometimes been rather arbitrarily done, from a song, but 
to describe both as short poems, capable of being recited or 
sung. The recitations of the minstrels differed much from 
the long-sustained monologues or dramatic readings of mod- 
ern reciters. They were generally delivered by the musical.

"THE WYF OF AUCHTERMUCHTY." 30I 

not the speaking voice, and frequently accompanied by some 
simple instrument. The minstrel suggests the harp, though 
the voice alone was often used, and after the earliest period 
the bagpipes, the fife, or the fiddle were the common instru- 
ments. The best songs had, as well as words, what we express 
by the indefinable word, an "air," a something which no 
words can convey, like air invisible, but like air, the atmo- 
sphere in which, for the moment, both the singer and his 
hearers live and move. 

The most ancient of the shorter poems we can distinctly 
trace to a Fife origin is " The Wyf of Auchtermuchty," the 
little inland village whose name is a shibboleth of the lost 
dialect which was a cross between Celtic and Saxon, and 
whose industry, first of the plough, afterwards of the hand- 
loom, was so marked a type of rural Fife. The still older 
ballads of "Rauf Colzear" and " Johne the Reif " and "their 
kyn " were natural favourites in a district of coal-mines and 
farms ; but their tone and dialect show they grew in a more 
southern clime, and were only transplanted to the colder soil 
of Fife. "The Wyf of Auchtermuchty " must have been 
written in Fife. It is certainly earlier than 1568, for it 
appears in the Bannatyne Manuscript. If its ascription in 
the same manuscript to Sir John Moffat could be trusted, it 
was probably the composition of a chaplain who said or sung 
the morning mass at the High Altar of Dunfermline Abbey in 
1494. Nor would its comic style have been out of keeping 
with the taste for mirth the manners of that age allowed the 
jolly friars to indulge in as a solace from graver cares. It is 
a tale of rustic life in the middle ages, appropriately attached 
to the little village near Falkland, at one time part of the 
estate of the Celtic Earl, which had passed to the Crown 
by forfeiture, and at the date of the ballad was cultivated by 
many small tenants. One of these is the chief character in

302 SPECIMEN OF FIFE COMEDY. 

the ballad. Its theme may be shortly told. A husband and 
husbandman of this village, disgusted with ploughing on a day 
of wind and rain, such as still often drenches the Fife field- 
labourer to the skin, proposes to his wife when he comes 
home that they should change parts, and that he should keep 
the house while she should drive the plough. She agrees, 
but warns him of all he would have to look after : the 
bedding of the bairns, the kneading of the dough, the herd- 
ing of the kye, the churning of the butter, the herding of the 
geese, the kindling of the kiln, — for " we haif," she reminds 
him, "ane deir ferme on our heid." 
All goes well with her ploughing, and as 

** Sche lowsit oxin aucht or nine," 

it must have been the common plough of the village she had 
to drive. But with the goodman all goes ill. The greedy 
gled licks up five of the seven goslings ; an ill - willy cow 
wounds him when he goes to drive the calves home. He tries 
spinning, but bends too near the low. He jumbles the milk 
in the churn for a good long hour until he sweats, but 
**The sorow crap of buttir he gatt." 

While trying to drive a sow with a club, he kills the two gos- 
lings the gled had left. Forgetting to put water into the pot, 
the fire burns the bottom out. . The kiln blazes up, through 
his putting too much kindling on. The bairns who have been 
paidling in the burn soil the sheets, and when he tries to 
wash these, the burn carries them off in a spate. It is plain 
he has mistaken his vocation. A man cannot do the work 
of a woman. 

The moral is easy to anticipate : — 

'* Quoth he, quhen I forsuke my pluche, 
I trow I bot forsuke my sell ; 
And I will 10 my pluche agane, 
For I and this hous will never do weill."

"WOOING OF JOK AND JENNY." 303 

Such was the solution of the question of the sexes in fif- 
teenth-century Fife. A few homely touches bring before us, 
as in a picture of Wilkie or an etching of Geikie, the daily 
lives of the Scottish husbandman and his wife. It is far 
superior to " John Grumlie," a modern variation on the same 
theme. 

The " Wowing of Jok and Jenny," attributed by Bannatyne 
to " Maister John Clerk," is so similar to " The Wyf of Auch- 
termuchty " in dialect and humour, that we may reasonably 
conjecture, though we cannot prove, that it belongs to the 
same locality and the same period. It is a comic inventory 
of the tocher of a bride and the goods of a bridegroom in the 
same class of life as the husbandman of Auchtermuchty. The 
satire turns on poverty, but it is poverty taken kindly rather 
than felt keenly in the hours of " wowing," and in spite of it, 

'* Syne gaid togidder bayth Jynny and Jok." 

Perhaps there is a covert reproach addressed to the lords of 
the land that the condition of the poor labourers living on it 
should be so miserable ; though the more common reading is 
that Jok, like richer wooers, displays his goods and chattels to 
allure his bride. Another of these early ballads, " How the 
Dumb Wyf was taught to Speak," while it does not itself 
bear any distinct trace of a Fife origin, was maliciously allo- 
cated to that county by the lines Kirkpatrick Sharpe supplied 
at its beginning — 

** Thair dwelt a laird in Fyffe, 

Sic men ar countit madde, 

Quha weddit ane gude wyflfe, 

Rilche, dumb, and wondrous sadde. " 

The tale is common since or before Boccaccio, but there 
is something original in its development, which shows how 
the cure which " ane great grim man " recommended to the

304 "CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN." 

laird, being ignorantly applied, the dumb wife not only spoke, 
but swore, and without rhyme or reason 

** Now deafiis up all the hous.'* 

Meeting the " grim man " a second time, the husband in vain 
seeks for a remedy to bind the tongue he has unloosed, and 
gets for his only consolation the advice — 

" Gang hame agane, 

For it is ill ower all ; 
Latt thy wyf speik her fill 

Sen scho thereto was borne ; 
For wyflfis will have thair will, 

Thocht ye and I had swome. ** 

The best of* these old comic songs was " Christ's Kirk on 
the Green," for the superiority of which over English ballads 
the Scot used to fight with his southern neighbours. The 
point of the combat as well as the combatants have changed, 
as in other ancient battles. English satirists have withdrawn 
from the field ; but it has become a favourite dispute amongst 
Scottish critics who was the author and what was the scene 
of the jolly Fair and romping games which set the mode 
and gave the rhythm for so many later Scottish poems. 
Certainly earlier than the date of the Bannatyne Manuscript, 
scarcely by possibility the work of James I., to whom it 
is ascribed by Bannatyne, but .even less likely of James V., 
to whom it has been transferred by some modern editors, 
it was probably composed about the same time as, and to 
rival, the kindred poems of "Peebles to the Play" and 
"Falkland on the Green" referred to in it. The parish 
of Leslie in Fife has long claimed it, and Allan Ramsay 
supported the claim ; but this has been stoutly contested 
by an Aberdeenshire Leslie, which also possesses its " Christ's 
Kirk." Probably the writer purposely left the locality doubt- 
ful, a wise stroke for popularity, as every place with a village

HENRYSON S MORAL SONGS. 305 

green for games, and a kirk dedicated to Christ, might 
assert, as the ballad does, its superiority either to Peebles 
or Falkland. The title of Fife to " Falkland on the Green " 
— a song unfortunately lost— cannot of course be disputed ; 
nor that Fife had many villages where, from the days of 
the first to the fifth James, there was dancing and revelry, 
playing with the ball, and shooting at the butts, which are 
the sports alluded to or described in "Christ^s Kirk on 
the Green." It is a picture of merry Scotland before the 
late advent of the Renaissance brought forth a more refined 
and artificial style, in the pensive sweetness and pure moral- 
ity of Henryson, and the mingled mirth and melancholy of 
Dunbar, to be so quickly followed by the tragedies and 
satires of the Reformation, whose Puritan spirit banished 
for a time the older strains of Scottish song. One of the 
poets last named is the finest flower of the poetry of Fife ; 
though Henryson, who chiefly cultivated the narrative style 
of Chaucer, or, as became the schoolmaster of Dunfermline, 
the didactic fable, has left two ballads, amongst the best 
of their class, " The Garniture of Gude Ladyis " and " The 
Bluidy Serk." Both are allegories, and both reveal the 
pious student of New Testament Scripture. In the latter 
respect they were a presage of the coming Reformation. 
Without the slightest imitation, the former beautiful song 
recalls St PauPs description of the Christian's armour. We 
may quote the first and last stanzas ; — 

** Of Honour hie sould be hir hude, 
Upon hir hedc to weir ; 
Garnist with Governance so gude 
Nae demyng sould hir deir. 



Hir Shune sould be of sickemess 
In tyme that scho nocht slyd ;

306 TRAGIC SONGS. 

The alliterative style of the older poetry still lingers, and 
forces the conceit in the two closing lines, which are inferior 
to the rest of the piece. 

" The Bluidy Serk " is a ballad of the simple tragic order. 
The king's daughter, who "of all fairhede bore the flower," 
is seized by the foul Giant, who was "the loathliest on to 
look that on the ground might gang," rescued by " a worthy 
prince that had no peer," who captures the Giant, but is 
himself so "evil wounded that he behoved to die." The 
dying lover bequeaths the bluidy sark to his mistress, 
bidding her 

** First think on it and syne on me, 
When men come you to woo ; 
The ladye said, By Mary free, 
Thereto I make a vow." 

The Christian moral is almost a surprise, which the reader 
may be left to discover for himself. 

Probably as old as Henryson is the anonymous tragic 
ballad of "Lammikin," which heightens the gloom of the 
gaunt ruin of Balwearie, the castle of Michael Scot. Pro- 
fessor Aytoun, no mean authority, was of opinion that no 
one " has discovered the locality of the castle which Lammi- 
kin built and baptised with blood." But failing any other 
strong competitor for the honour, which a grim ballad like 
an ancient ghost confers, we do not see why Lord Wearie's 
castle should not be Balwearie, though the present stones 
can hardly be those Lammikin laid, nor any of the trees 
which still stand there be that on whose boughs the birdie 
sang sweetly : — 

** But little, little cared false Nourice for that, 
For it was her gallows-tree." 

There are touches of pathos in this song which surpass

LYNDSAY WROTE NO BALLADS. 307 

anything in later ballads often preferred to it, as when the 
lady before her own murder — 

" Lifted up her baby, 
She kist it cheek and chin, 
And kist the lips ance rosy, 
But nae breath was therein." 

Nor has the civil war of classes ever found more poignant 
expression than in the nurse's answer to Lammikin, when 
he asks her to scour the basin for the lady's blood, as 
"she cam* of noble kin" — 

'* There needs nae basin, Lammikin, 
Let it rin through the floor ; 
What better is the heart's blude 
O' the rich than o* the poor ? " 

Compare this with the vapid and feebly venomous diatribes 
of the vulgar socialist orator, and you recognise the differ- 
ence between the voice of the lioness and the hissing of 
the serpent. 

Sir David Lyndsay, who once was the most popular bard 
of Fife, has, unfortunately for his lasting fame, left no 
ballads. He was too learned for their simplicity, too in- 
terested an actor in the passing politics of his time for 
their universal humour. The ballad literature of the Refor- 
mation period in Fife was, as elsewhere, a new genus, 
retaining the old name and form, but in substance a differ- 
ent thing. It was either satirical, as in the ballads of 
Robert Sempill, issued from the press of Lekprevik, which 
may now be read in the scholarly edition of Dr Cranstoun 
for the Scottish Text Society, and which had, as James 
Melville tells us, so wide a circulation in Fife. Or it was 
religious, as in *The Gude and Godlie Ballates' of the 
Wedderbums, which Professor Mitchell of St Andrews is 
about to issue in the publications of the same Society. It

was indeed one of the avowed intentions of the Reformers 
to drive the old amatory and romantic ballads out of the 
field, and to substitute spiritual songs, set to the same tunes, 
— much as revivalists of the present day have adopted older 
secular melodies. The Reformers were to a large extent 
successful. The old ballads lost for a time their widespread 
popularity; but they were not extinguished. Bannatyne, 
Maitland, and Asloan were collecting them with assiduous 
care at the time when the Reformation was in full current 
The very effort to suppress them by force or stratagem, by 
a common law of human nature led to a reaction. The 
Catholic and Episcopalian minority favoured their preser- 
vation, and their spirit passed, as has not been sufficiently 
noticed, to the Royalists or Cavaliers in the seventeenth 
century, and to the Jacobites in the eighteenth. For a time 
the Presbyterians had an almost exclusive command of the 
Scottish press, and the older ballad literature of Scotland was 
handed down, not in print but often in corrupt or altered 
versions, in a few manuscripts, or by oral tradition. It con- 
tained too much of the life-blood of the Scottish nation to 
die. In the * Annals of Scots Printing, from its Introduc- 
ion in 1507 to the Beginning of the Seventeenth Century,' 
for which students of Scottish literature owe a debt of grati- 
tude to Dr Dickson of Carnoustie, and Mr Edmond, formerly 
of Aberdeen, practically no ballads, except those of Sempill 
and other satirists, appear after the Reformation. The poetry 
of this period has a distinctly moral or religious cast, as 
is seen in the Hymns of Alexander Hume, Montgomerie's 
"The Cherrie and the Slae," and *The Gude and Godlie 
Ballates,' of which the title is significant — * Ane compendious 
Book of Godlie Psalms and Spiritual Sangis, collected furth 
of sindrie partis of the Scripture, with diveris utheris Ballatis

*THE GUDE AND GODLIE BALLATES/ 309 

of Sin and Harlotrie, with augmentation of Sindrie Gude and 
Godlie Ballates not contenat in the First Edition, 1587.* 

The first edition of these Godlie Ballates was published 
more than a century before James Watson, in 1 706-11, fol- 
lowed by Allan Ramsay in 1724, ventured to put in print 
some of the earlier ballads, fortunately omitting most of 
those which could be deemed coarse or profane. But as 
the earlier ballads had all along continued to be occa- 
sionally sung, so a few new ones, in the same style, had 
continued to be written. A ballad which has been in- 
cluded in many collections, though it must be owned it 
scarcely deserves the name, belongs to Fife because of its 
reputed author. Richard Bannatyne, the secretary of Knox, 
makes the earliest reference to it, and speaks somewhat 
enigmatically as to the authorship of the "Ballate direct, 
as it had been from the captane of the Castle, complaining, 
as he lay upon the Crag of Edinburgh, and because we never 
understood the vaine of his poesie of before ye sail reid gif 
ye pleis that ye may judge out of what arrow bag sic arrowis 
are shott." The ballad which follows is in the metre of 
" The Cherrie and the Slae." If it was indeed the work of 
Kirkaldy of Grange, it is his only poem preserved, and as 
such has a unique interest, though it would be difficult to 
defend it from the character of "a rowstie rhyme," which 
Knox's secretary gives it. Nor could a poem of which the 
author is the hero come within any recognised class of 
ballads. Bannatyne's version proves it to be contemporary 
with Grange's gallant defence of the Castle under the stan- 
dard of Queen Mary, and the metre makes the conjecture 
tempting that Montgomerie, not Kirkaldy, was the author. 
But it is far inferior to Montgomerie's popular poem. Robert 
Burns mentions he had seen the music to which this very 
peculiar metre could be set. We should now scarcely con-

3IO BALLAD OF THE CASTLE. 

ceive it possible that a ballad could have been sung with 
such a metre, of which the following specimen may suffice : — 

" At the Castle of Edinburch, 
Upone the bank bath greinc and rouch 

As myne, alone I lay, 
With paper, pen, and inke in hand. 
Musing as I could understand 

Oflf the suddan decay 
That unto this pure natioune 

Apeirantly dois come, 
I fand our Congregatioune 

Was caus of all, and some 
Whois auchthoris instructoris 

Hes blindit thame so long. 
That blameless and schameless 

Both riche and poure they wrong." 

In the reign of James VI. the Court was not more favour- 
able than the Kirk to the production of ballads. It was 
indeed the aim of the Royal Prentice in the art of poetry to 
introduce new metres and a new style, and the circle of 
courtier poets, Montgomerie, Hume, Ayton, Alexander, and 
Drummond, wrote sonnets, odes, lamentations, elegies, epi- 
grams, and epitaphs, but few ballads. Their artificial versi- 
fication had its merits ; but they were not the natural charms, 
the simple pathos, the wild woodnotes of the ballad. These 
poets rarely attempted songs, and few of their poems could be 
set to music, the appropriate, though not invariable, accompani- 
ment of the ballad. The printing-press had superseded the 
minstrel. The poet could no longer rely on the voice as his 
interpreter, or sing with the bold directness and sudden 
transition which in an earlier age drew laughter or tears. 
Scotland, too, had no theatre on whose stage, as in England, 
the drama could provide a frame in which might be set the 
exquisite jewels of Jonsonian or Shakespearian song. The 
ballad, though its life was threatened, was fortunately pre- 
served in two separate channels which ran through different

LAYS OF CAVALIERS AND JACOBITES. 3 II 

Strata of the Scottish nation. The inextinguishable sense of 
humour, coarse and boisterous at times, but always natural 
amongst the common people, could not be repressed even 
by the straitest Calvinism. Its flow, which had its sources 
in such poems as "The Wyf of Auchtermuchty," "Christ's 
Kirk on the Green," continued, though it often seemed to 
disappear, till it was revived by William Hamilton of Gilbert- 
field, Allan Ramsay, and Robert Fergusson. It received new 
strength and ampler volume from the original fountain of 
the muse of Burns, whose overflowing genius, like the spate 
which turns a burn into a torrent, almost hid the parent 
source. The Civil Wars of the seventeenth, and the risings 
on behalf of the Stuarts in the eighteenth century, pro- 
duced many striking incidents and a few heroic deeds, and 
gave birth amongst the nobility and gentry to a new romantic 
minstrelsy. The Lays of the Cavaliers, followed by those 
of the Jacobites, struck a more refined vein of poetry, which, 
at first popular only in a section of the higher classes, con- 
quered by its intrinsic merit the whole nation, just as the 
popular poetry of the peasants for a similar reason won its 
way from the cottage to the castle. The Cavalier songs are 
many of them English, but few express the Cavalier, a later 
echo of the Chivalric spirit, better than the well-known lines 
of Montrose : — 

*' But if no faithless action stain 

Thy love and constant word, 
ril make thee famous by my pen, 

And glorious by my sword. 
I'll serve thee in such noble ways, 

As ne'er was known before ; 
I'll deck and crown thy head with bays, 

And love thee more and more. " 

The Jacobite songs are almost all of Scottish origin, and,

312 INFLUENCE OF BURNS. 

shepherd, became favourites even in Whig drawing-rooms, 
and might be heard at times in the cottages of the de- 
scendants of the Covenanters. The lyre of Bums, respon- 
sive to every note of deep passion and true melody, gave 
utterance alike to Jacobite and Jacobin sentiments. The 

author of 

*■ '* The rank is but the guinea stamp, 
The man's the gowd for a' that," 

took pleasure in imagining — 

" Haply my sires their blood have shed, 
Fast following where your fathers led." 

Rob Donn, the Gaelic Burns, served in the ranks of the Hano- 
verian Fencibles, yet wrote songs with memories of the Stuarts. 
In the verses of these and other Scottish poets, but especi- 
ally in Burns, the two streams of ballad poetry coalesced. 
Their charms came from and went to the heart which beats 
in every breast. Though they did not extinguish, they 
softened the distinction of classes, silenced the rivalry of 
factions, and almost subdued the bigotry of sects. Scotland 
had once more a national poetry proud of its origin, and of 
which all its natives could be proud. 

This excursion from Fife may perhaps be pardoned for the 
sake of the subject, but it is necessary now to return and trace 
the thread, slender at times but never severed, which connects 
the more ancient with the more modern ballads of Fife. Sir 
Robert Ayton of Kinaldy, the friend of Ben Jonson and of 
Hobbes, deserves a note, though he wrote only in English, 
and as a Court poet, were it for nothing else than his version 
of " Auld Lang Syne." There was without doubt an older 
Scottish song and air, as has been shown in an interesting 
paper where the history of both words and air are minutely 
traced by Mr Dick of Newcastle in the Proceedings of the 
Society of Scottish Antiquaries for 1892. But Ay ton's is the

"OLD LONG SVNE" AND "AULD LANG SYNE." 313 

first printed version. He turned the theme to a different pur- 
pose, to express the woes of a forgotten lover recalling past 
pleasure, when expostulating with his mistress. His poem, 
" Old Long Syne," has the credit of preserving the opening 
words and the motive of the air which Burns made the 
national song of Scotland. We may quote for comparison 
Ayton's first stanza — 

** Should old acquaintance be forgot, 

And never thought upon ; 
The flames of love extinguished, 

And freely past and gone ? 
Is thy kind heart now grown so cold, 

In that loving breast of thine, 
That thou canst never once reflect 

On old long syne ? " 

The reader may recall Mr Ruskin's acute criticism and appre- 
ciation of broad Scotch as one of the best dialects for song. 
" No heart," he says, " would be touched by the phrase, * Old 
long since,* while every one is sensible of the pathos of the 
words, * Auld lang syne.* " Ayton preserve;d, it will be seen, 
the last, though he rejected the two first words of his verna- 
cular. There is also a version by Allan Ramsay. Burns told 
Thomson he took his far superior verses from an old man's 
singing 

" Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 

And never brought to mind ? 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot. 

And days o* lang syne ? " 

but we cannot doubt he added the chorus, as well as the suc- 
ceeding verses, and is as much entitled to be deemed the 
true author of the national song of Scotland, which has since 
travelled with his countrymen round the world, as Shakespeare 
is of the plays whose plot is taken from old romances.

than " Auld Lang Syne " in the transition from the Ancient to 
the Modern Minstrelsy, and may even be said to have formed, 
through their pubHcation in Percy^s * Reliques,* the landmark 
of the revival of the romantic Scottish ballad, are intimately 
connected with Fife. Though it is not possible to fix with 
certainty the date and authorship of " Sir Patrick Spens " and 
" Hardyknute," Mr Robert Chambers certainly pushed theory 
to an extreme when he contended that most of the best 
ancient romantic Scottish ballads were the work of Elizabeth 
Halket, Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie, who was born in April 
1677, a"d died in 1727. Still his suggestion that she could 
claim the original authorship of " Sir Patrick Spens " and 
" Hardyknute " is dismissed too superciliously in Professor 
Child's note. "I have not felt called upon," he remarks, 
** to say anything of the attempt of the late Mr Robert Cham- 
bers to prove * Sir Patrick Spens ' a literary work of the last 
century. . . . The flimsy plea of Mr Chambers has been 
effectually disposed of by Mr Norval Clyne, * The Romantic 
Scottish Ballads and the Lady Wardlaw,' Aberdeen, 1859 ; 
and by Mr James Hutton Walker, * Early Scottish Ballads,' 
Glasgow, 1867." 

The material facts seem to be that " Hardyknute " was first 
printed during the life of this lady in 17 19, and "Sir Patrick 
Spens" in the first edition of Percy's * Reliques 'in 1765; that 
her claim to the former was stated by Percy in the second 
edition of the * Reliques,' on the authority of Lord Hailes, who 
yet was of opinion that " part of the ballad might be ancient, 
but retouched and much enlarged by the lady above men- 
tioned." Her claim to the latter poem, " Sir Patrick Spens," 
first broached in 1839 by Mr David Laing, whose opinion 
always deserves consideration, and afterwards asserted on the 
ground of the identity of some expressions to those in " Hardy-

"THE LAST WORDS OF BONNY HECK." 3IS 

knute," by Chambers in 1859, has no sufficient basis of proof; 
while the fact that it was never before, like " Hardyknute," 
attributed to her, is strong evidence on the negative side. 
Apart from Lady Wardlaw's alleged authorship, the Fife local- 
ity of " Sir Patrick Spens " is proved by his name, so common 
in Fife, the king's order given in Dunfermline, and the loss of 
the ship— 

** Hauf owcr, hauf ower to Aberdour." 

The attempt to transfer this to the Aberdeenshire Aberdour is 
far-fetched. Whether the historical basis of the ballad was 
the voyage of Margaret, daughter of Alexander III., to marry 
Eric of Norway, or the return of her daughter, or a mixture of 
the two ; or even whether it is without historical basis, and 
the mere echo in song of some unknown shipwreck to which 
the Norway lines were afterwards attached, matters little. Its 
excellence as a ballad, vouched for by two such poets as Cole- 
ridge and Scott, is incontestable, and is proved by the great 
variety of its versions, one of which brings to view the scene 
of so many shipwrecks on the Fife coast. 

** It was late, late on a Saturday night, 
And early on a Sunday mom, 
That robes of silk and feather-beds 
Came floating to Kean-gorn" (Kinghom). 

To the same period, towards the end of the seventeenth or 
beginning of the eighteenth century, belongs a humorous bal- 
lad, " The last dying words of Bonny Heck," first published 
by Watson in 1706. Its writer is believed to have been a 
West-country man, William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (1665- 
1751), a friend of Allan Ramsay, and the author of "Willie 
was a Wanton Wag." But for this song he has chosen a Fife 
scene and a Fife hero, " A famous Greyhound in the Shire of

Fife," who recounts his exploits at well-known places in the 
county : — 

" What great feats I have done my sell, 
Within clink of Kilrenny hell^ 
When I was souple, young, and fell, 

But fear or dread, 
John Ness and Paterson can tell, 

Whose hearts may bleid. 
They'll witness that I was the vier 
Of all the dogs within the shire. 



I ran alike on a* kind grounds ; 
Yea, in the midst of Airdry WhinSy 
I grip't the mawkins by the bunns, 

Or be the neck, 
Where naething could slay them but guns, 

Save bonny Heck. 

At the Kittys Mtiir and Kelly Law, 
Where good stout hares gang fast awa*, 
So cliverly I did it claw 

With pith and speid ; 
I bure the bell before them a', 

As dear's a beid." 

Ramsay recalls his friend's ballad in one of his rhyming 
epistles to Hamilton : — 

** When I begoud to cun in verse, 
And could your * Airdry Whins * rehearse. 
Where bonny Heck ran fast and fierce. 

It warmed my breast ; 
Then Emulation did me pierce, 

Quilk ne'er since ceased." 

Three other humorous songs of the same, or nearly the 
same, period belong to Fife, by different links of scene, asso- 
ciation, or authorship. " Maggie Lauder " is usually attrib- 
uted, but on no very certain evidence, to Francis Semple of 
Beltrees in Renfrewshire, who died in 1685. But the heroine 
was, or became, a Fifer, as she declares in the last stanza : —

"THE AULD man's MARE*S DEID." 317 

" I've lived in Fife baith maid and wife 

This ten years and a quarter ; 

Gin ye should come to Anster Fair, 

Speer ye for Maggie Lauder." 

So intimately had she become one of the traditions of her 
adopted county, that Tennant founded on her story his well- 
known comic heroic poem of " Anster Fair," the best piece in 
that vein which Scottish poetry has to boast of; and Captain 
Charles Gray, a native of Anstruther, wrote a sequel to the 
earlier song, of which, as little known, a verse may be 

quoted : — 

" Then Rob made bonnie Meg his bride, 
And to the kirk they ranted ; 
He played the * Auld East Neuk o' Fife,' 
And bonnie Maggie vaunted." 

" The Auld Man's Mare's Deid " is still more closely con- 
nected with Fife by its subject and author, Patie Birnie, the 
Fiddler of Kinghorn. Allan Ramsay in his mock elegy on 
the Fiddler, which ends with the surprise line, 

** For to a* Britain be it kend. 
He is not deid," 

credits Patie with being at Bothwell Brig, where he left the 

field, and 

" Scoured o'er moss and moor amain 
To Reeky straught. 
And tald how many Whigs were slain 
Before they faught." 

But the best lines of the elegy praise him with better reason 
for his own songs : — 

** TviltUf wiltu doU a^ain, 
This sang he made frae his ain head. 
And eke, TAg Auld Alan's Mare she's dead^ 
The Pects attd Tares and a's to iead^ 

O fy upon her, 
A bonny auld thing this indeed, 

An't like ye'r honour."

3i8 "jenny's bawbee." 

His other song has, it is feared, been lost ; but the " Auld 
Man's Mare," though it has ceased to be played to the pas- 
sengers crossing the Ferry of the Forth, will be always remem- 
bered for its racy vernacular. One stanza is so good an 
example that we give it for the sake of English readers 
whose taste for recent Scots novels shows they no longer 
require a translation of what is in truth only an older form 
of their own dialect — 

" The auld man's mare's deid, 
The puir man's mare's deid, 
The auld man's mare's deid, 
A mile aboon Dundee. 

She was cut luggit, painch lippit, 
Steel waimit, staincher fittit, 
Chanler chaftit, lang neckit, 
And yet the brute did dee." 

What has become of our old familiars, the blind player and 
his faithful comrade the fiddler (who played it by request 
when we last heard it), since the bridge has crossed the 
Forth? They have found no Allan Ramsay to write their 
elegy and assure us they are not dead. 

Of a more primitive type is the song of " Jenny's Bawbee," a 
simple rant, as Chambers calls it, yet whose jingling words and 
air catch the memory. 

** And a* that e'er my Jenny had, 
My Jenny had, my Jenny had, 
And a* that e'er my Jenny had, 
Was ae bawbee. 

There's your plack and my plack, 
And your plack and my plack, 
And my plack and your plack, 
And Jenny's bawbee.

We'll put it in the pint stoup.

*'AULD ROBIN GRAY." 319 

We have given it at length, as the words seem to prove 
it referred to a children's game with small coins, of which 
Jenny's was the smallest, and had no metaphorical Jacobite or 
other allusion, as Chambers surmises. Sir Alexander Boswell 
elaborated it into a comic, and another writer into a senti- 
mental song; but such merit as it has was lost when the 
childish words were departed from. 

A song altogether of Fife origin and authorship marks the 
commencement of the period of modem ballads. It will be 
acknowledged that "Auld Robin Gray" has few superiors, 
either amongst its predecessors or successors, though to call 
it the " King of Scottish Ballads," as Chambers does, is to 
raise it to a dangerous eminence. It is more to the point to 
observe its modern character and sentiment. This cannot be 
better shown than by an extract from the letter Lady Anne 
Barnard wrote in 1823 to the author of * Waverley,' who had 
referred in the * Pirate ' to " Jeannie Gray, the village heroine 
in Lady Anne Lindsay's beautiful ballad " : — 

" Robin Gray " [Lady Anne, then an old lady, writes], so called 
from its being the name of the old herdsman at Balcarres, was bom 
soon after the close of the year 1771. My sister Margaret had 
married and accompanied her husband to London ; I was melan- 
choly, and endeavoured to amuse myself by attempting a few poet- 
ical trifles. There was an ancient Scotch melody, of which I was 
passionately fond ; Sophy Johnstone used to sing it to us at Bal- 
carres. I longed to sing old Sophy's air to different words, and to 
give to its plaintive tone some litde history of virtuous distress in 
humble life, which might suit it. While attempting to effect this 
in my closet, I called to my little sister, now Lady Hardwicke, " I 
have been writing a ballad, my dear ; I am oppressing my heroine 
with many misfortunes. I have already sent her Jamie to sea, and 
broken her father's arm, and made her mother fall sick, and given 
her Auld Robin Gray for a lover ; but I wish to load her with a 
fifth sorrow in the four lines, poor thing ! Help me to one, I pray." 
" Steal the cow, sister Anne," said the little Elizabeth. The cow 
was immediately lifted by me, and the song completed. At our

320 ITS ORIGIN AND AUTHORESS. 

fireside, amongst our neighbours, " Auld Robin Gray " was always 
called for. I was pleased with the approbation it met with. 

Surely never has the origin of a ballad and the birth of a poem 
been more charmingly told. Scott's answer is as delightful — 

I wish to heaven I could obtain an equally authentic copy of 
" Hardyknute," and 1 think old Fife might cock her crest in honour 
of her two poetesses. 

Lady Anne concealed her authorship through shyness, and she 
mentions to Scott — 

Little as this matter seems to have been worthy of dispute, it 
afterwards became almost a party question between the sixteenth 
and eighteenth centuries. " Robin Gray " was either a ver&gt;% very 
ancient ballad, composed perhaps by David Rizzio, and a great 
curiosity, or a very, very modern matter, and no curiosity at all. 

While this shows how much of the tone of the old ballads its 
gifted authoress had caught, the dispute does not say much 
for the criticism of last century. The spirit of this fine ballad 
is derived from modern sentiment. No one who compares it 
with the ancient songs of Fife, of which we have given speci- 
mens, can fail to see how different is the source of its pathos. 
Had it been written in the sixteenth century, Jamie would 
have killed either himself or Auld Robin, or perhaps his love 
would have fled with him and left Auld Robin to a solitary 
fate. A second part was afterwards written, in which, acting 
upon an unhappy suggestion of the Laird of Dalyell, Auld 
Robin confesses that he stole the cow to secure Jeannie, who 
had vowed while it lived not to leave her father and mother. 
Even a third version or fragment exists, which, no doubt, is 
the one Lady Anne says to Scott " shall remain in the corners 
of my portfolio." But the fame of the ballad and its author- 
ess rests on the first version, composed in a happy moment 
of melancholy, and the fresh inspiration of poetry.

RECENT ROMANTIC SONGS OF FIFE. 32 1 

From the end of the last century down to almost the present 
day Fife has produced an abundant harvest of ballads in all 
the styles of its ancient minstrelsy — the Romantic, the Pathetic, 
the Humorous, and the Historical. Though none of these 
modern compositions have attained or deserved the popu- 
larity of the ancient, enough of good poetry may be culled 
to make a pretty variegated and sweet garland of Fife songs 
of the present century. We can only glance at this part of 
the subject, and crave pardon of the reader who misses any 
of his favourites. 

The Romantic class of songs is represented by " The Witch 
of Fife," in Hogg's * Queen's Wake,' and her more gruesome 
sister, " The Witch of Pittenweem," by David Vedder. The 
Pathetic has good examples in the songs of Captain Charles 
Gray of Anstruther, "Gloomy Winter's now awa'," and the 
same writer's "Blythe, blythe, and merry are we," and his 
son Lieutenant Gray s song, " When first I saw the witching 
smiles " ; " Hame is aye hamely," by Robert Malone of An- 
struther; "Mary Macneil," by Erskine Conolly of Crail, of 
whom his brother writes, " Unambitious of fame as a poet, 
though he frequently wrote verses, he never ventured on pub- 
lication"; the "Emigrant's Lament" or "Why left I my 
hame," of Robert Gilfillan of Dunfermline; the Weaver's 
song of Henry Syme of the same town, to the tune of " The 
Boatie Rows " ; " The Herring Drave," a cheery fisher's song, 
by Margaret Bell; the "Woods of Aberdour," by James 
Ballantine; the version of "Where Gadie rins," one of the 
sweetest worded of all Scotch songs, by Dr John Park of St 
Andrews ; the more highly cultivated but true-hearted poems 
of Principal Shairp and Sir Noel Paton, and the spirited 
hunting-songs of Whyte- Melville. One of the best known 
modem songs of a pathetic cast connected with Fife is that 
of Jenny Nettles, who is said to have been buried between

322 PATHETIC AND HUMOROUS SONGS. 

the lands of two lairds near the Lomonds, and the song made 
on her, though its allusions to her sad story are slight, has 
always been popular in Fife. Two songs of Fife, which 
grew from the seed of two Fife proverbs, give the two sides 
of life — its sunshine and its shower, better perhaps than any 
others of recent date : Ballantine's " Ilka blade o' grass keps 
its ain drap o' dew," and " There's aye a slippy stane at ilka 
body's door," recovered by Lady Lindsay from the recitation 
of a young girl in one of the small coast burghs. I^dy 
Lindsay's graceful songs, one of which gives a picture of the 
landscape of the East Neuk, as well as others probably 
written in Fife, like the poems of the late Lord Rosslyn, 
prove that the poetic spirit still lives in some of the old 
castles and mansions of Fife. The cottage has also con- 
tinued to produce its minstrels, of whom the best known in 
the county was William Thomson, postmaster of Kennoway, 
the Theta of the * Fife Herald.' The poetic spirit knows no 
distinction of classes, and is more indifferent than even the 
philosophic temper to outward wealth or station when pos- 
sessed by inward poverty or dulness. 

More numerous and more famous than the Romantic or 
Pathetic are the Humorous songs of modern Fife, which has 
retained through all changes an original vein of wit, as might 
be expected from the original character of its natives. Like 
all wit, it comes nearest home to those to the manner born. 
But even a Southron who has heard them well sung can ap- 
preciate the comic tunes and choruses of such songs as — 

" There cam' a Fiddler out o' Fife, 
A blink beyond Balwearie, O ; " 
or — 

" There was a wee Cooper that lived in Fife— 
Hey, knickety, knackety, noo, noo, noo ; " 

or the older song of " The East Neuk o' Fife," and the more

"THE AULD SCOTTISH BRUGH." 323 

recent one of " The Auld Scottish Bnigh " or burgh. Anstru- 
ther is probably intended, but the census is kept at a con- 
veniently low figure, to allow other towns to contend for or 
decline the honour. 



* In Scotland stands an ancient brugh wi' some twal hundred people, 
A lang and narrow strip o* street and ae high-shouldered steeple ; 
Ilk grocer i' the brugh is a bailie or has been, 
But the Provost was perpetual, and drave the hale machine. 
At twal o'clock the Provost cam' and stoud upo' the street. 
And wagg^t to his right-hand man i' the public-house to meet ; 
The Bailie threw his apron by, and o'er their gill they sat, 
And they managed a* the toun's affairs in a bit quiet chat. 
The Deacon, wi* a face half-washed, gaed consequential by, 
But the Deacon as a*body kent had nae finger in the pie : 
The Deacon made the Provost's breeks and a' hb laddies' claes. 
And the Provost, tho' the best o* friends, was yet the warst o' faes. 
And when the canvassin' cam* round the member walked about, 
And linkit i' the Provost's arm, they sought the Deacon out. 
The bodies threw their night-caps by, or wi' them cleared a chair. 
And the member sat i' the ben house wi' a condescendin' air." 



We have given this extract, as the song is not so well known 
as it deserves to be. It is clear and faithful, like a drawing 
on a Dutch tile, of a scene in the burgh, as with slight alter- 
ations it might till the other day, if not to-day, be seen. Who 
has not known one of these perpetual Provosts ; sat, if he is 
a frequenter of inns, with one of these Bailies over a gill ; 
watched the half-washed consequential Deacon with no finger 
in the pie ; and laughed at the condescending member from 
London, only to be seen in the burgh when the canvassing 
comes round ? The rural life of Fife is preserved in the 
simpler songs of " The Harvest Field," " The Washing 
Green," and "The Miller of Fife." The last of these was 
often sung by itinerant singers down to recent times, but 
as this class is passing away a stanza may be given as an 
example : —

324 RECENT COMIC SONGS. 

" When I was a Miller in Fife, 

Losh I thought that the sound o* the happer 
Said — Tak hame a wee flow to your wife, 

To help to be brose to your supper. 
Then my conscience was narrow and pure. 

But someway by random it racket, 
For I lifted twa neivefu' or mair. 
While the happer said — Tak it, man, tak it. 
Hey for the mill and the kill. 

The garland and geer for my cogie ; 
Hey for the whisky or yill 
That washes the dust owre my craigie." 

Of another strain is Thomas Latto's popular song, "The Kiss 
Ahint the Door"; and of yet another, the famous rhyming 
tour deforce^ " The Annuity" of George Outram, whose heroine, 
like " Maggie Lauder," attaches it to the county, though the 
writer came from Edinburgh. 

" I gaed to spend a week in Fife — 

An unco week it proved to be, 
For there I met a waesome wife 

Lamentin' her viduity. 
Her grief brak out sae fierce and fell, 
I thought her heart wad burst the shell, 
And — I was sae left to mysel' — 

I sell't her an annuity. " 

The well-known comic song of " Kate Dalrymple " found 
its heroine as well as its hero, Willie Speediespool, though 
the names are fictitious, at Kinaldy near St Andrews. " The 
Fife Laird " describes the eccentricities of two well-known 
lairds of Fife of former times. Sir Robert Anstruther of Bal- 
caskie, and Thomas, Earl of Kelly. 

It is more difficult to give samples of modern Historical 
songs connected with Fife. For, to speak plainly, neither 
Fife nor Scotland has, during the last hundred years, been 
making history. It has been too busy making money. Even 
the Jacobite movement of last century left fewer echoes in 
Fife than in the rest of Scotland, though we have always

fancied that " The Piper o' Dundee," generally identified with 
Carnegie of Finhaven in Angus, had something to do with the 
Kingdom. The writer took at least the well-known Fife 
air of " Aiken Drum," and the piper played a part perhaps as 
natural to a Fife burgher as to an Angus laird when he played 
by turns the Jacobite and Whig tunes. " The March of the 
Cameron Men," both words and air, was composed by a lady 
of Fife, Miss Mary Maxwell Campbell of Pitlour. 

Fife can certainly claim by a poetical, which is not a his- 
torical licence, if its ancient boundaries are restored, the ballad 
of " Sir James the Ross " by Michael Bruce, which contains at 
least one fine stanza — 

" His growth was as the tuAed fir 
That crowns the mountain brow ; 
And waving on his shoulders broad 
His locks of yellow flew." 

Other historical ballads connected with Fife of modern 
authorship are, — " The Laird of Ochiltree," who was no other 
than James Wemyss, younger of Bogie, a Groom of the Cham- 
ber to James VI., whose escape, described in the poem, was 
due to the wit of one of the Queen's maids of honour who 
loved him ; and " The Master of Wemyss," by William Mother- 
well. 

The Secession Kirk nurtured a distinct strain of melody, 
which, as might be expected, took a religious direction in 
"The Hymns of Ralph Erskine," "Weaving Spiritualised" 
of Michael Bruce of Kinnesswood, and the hymns of the 
" Untaught Muse " of James Syme of Dunfermline. The last 
writer is remarkable for the variety of subjects he essayed ; 
and though his political songs never reached high, those on 
"Jamaica," "Slavery," "Free Trade," "The Ten -Pound 
Renter," and " Canada," to which country he emigrated, like 
more than one of the later singers of Scotland of humble birth.

deserve to be mentioned. One verse from an " Epistle to a 
Rhyming Friend " expresses a common form of ambition in 
the peasantry of Scotland in modest terms : — 

" Weil, then, may Scotland never want 
Some bard sublime her praise to chant ; 
Wi' routh like us to rhyme and rant 

In ilka toun ; 
Till ilka village proudly vaunt 
Its rhyming loon." 

Should some cynic suggest this prayer has been too liberally 
granted, and that Fife, like the rest of Scotland, has produced 
too many rhymesters, a more lenient and perhaps more just 
critic might plead that such rhymes solace the hours of toil, 
refine the feelings, elicit the humour of the people, and create 
the atmosphere in which on some happy day a sublime bard 
is born.

Besides the names which have been taken as representatives 
of different aspects of character in Fife, the county has con- 
tributed probably more than any other in Scotland to the 
pages of biographical history. Mr Conolly, in his * Dictionary 
of Eminent Men of Fife/ includes no fewer than 547 in the 
list. But he has extended the claims of Fife citizenship with

a patriotic liberality, not merely to its natives, but to those 
" connected with it by property, residence, marriage, or other- 
wise^ No one is more anxious to prove a man of eminence 
his countryman than a Scotsman. It is the modern substitute 
for the boast at which the French laughed in their saying, 
" Long Scot is cousin of the King." Perhaps the present writer 
may be thought not to have erred in exclusiveness. Yet an 
endeavour has been made to keep in view what is the chief 
aim of this work, to illustrate from the History of Fife not 
only the characters of the county and its natives, but also 
their influence on the history and character of Scotland. 

Before quitting the field of biography and attempting to 
take a general view of the art and literature of Fife, there are 
still some illustrations of Fife character in other walks of life 
which can scarcely be passed over, though it will be necessary 
to retrace our steps a little as regards time. 

Fife has long boasted of the peaceful pursuits of its inhab- 
itants, and in the last and present centuries it was not so 
good a recruiting-ground as the Highlands. But in earlier 
times it did at least its share of fighting, and in the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries it produced three famous soldiers 
who occupy a distinct place in the military annals of Scotland, 
Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange and the two Leslies. 

William, son of Sir James Kirkaldy of Grange, near King- 
horn, Treasurer of James V., " a stout man, who always offered 
by single combat and at point of sword to maintain whatever 
he said," was when a boy a page of James V. In early youth, 
like his father he was one of the Scotsmen who saw that the 
future of Scotland lay with England and Protestantism, not 
with France or Ultramontane Rome. Born about 1530, he 
was present when only sixteen at the death of Beaton, was 
with Knox first in the castle, afterwards in the galleys, and 
was sent in 1547 a prisoner to Mount St Michael. Taking

advantage of the festivities of the Eve of the Epiphany 1549, 
Kirkaldy and several of his comrades — the brave Norman 
Leslie, and " the stout gentleman," Carmichael of Balmaddie, 
amongst the number — disarmed their keepers and escaped to 
England. Deprived of a pension by the death of Edward VI., 
he returned to France and entered the service of Henry II., 
whose war with the Emperor led him, as the war with England 
had its predecessors, to secure the aid of Scottish swords. 

Kirkaldy led a hundred light horse under Anne de Mont- 
morency, the Constable of France, in the desultory wars of 
Picardy. Of this mode of warfare, more than of great cam- 
paigns, he became an accomplished master. He was present 
on 31st August 1554 at the victory of Renti, in which Norman 
Leslie, called by the French king another Hector, fell. Sir 
James Melville, then a page of the Constable, heard the king, 
as he pointed to Kirkaldy, say, " Yonder is one of the most 
valiant men of our time." He took part three years later in 
the battle of St Quentin, when the French were routed, and 
the Constable, with Melville and many knights and soldiers, 
taken prisoners. Soon after the death of Henry II., Kirkaldy 
returned by way of England to Scotland, and married Mar- 
garet, daughter of Sir James Learmonth of Dairsie, Provost of 
St Andrews, a strong supporter of the Reformation. His 
single combat and defeat on Halidon Hill of Sir Ralph Evers, 
whose brother. Lord Evers, declined the challenge, was one of 
the last encounters of chivalry in Scotland. Though, like 
Murray, he for a time sided with Mary of Guise, he soon 
joined the Lords of the Congregation, and was with them at 
Cupar Muir. In the guerilla war which followed in Fife, 
D'Osell and his French troops spoiled with special animosity 
Kirkaldy's lands and castles. Grange, Wester Kinghom, and 
Hallyards; but the spirited leadership of the cavalry, his 
favourite force, by Kirkaldy, at last drove them from the

county. After Mary^s marriage with Darnley his services were 
again in request, and he rode with Murray in the Roundabout 
Raid, in describing which the author of "Randolph's Phantasy" 
appears to exaggerate his age though not his experience in the 
line — 

** His hoary head expert m war did breed the courtiers' fears." 

The failure of the Raid drove its leaders, including Kirkaldy, 
to England, and during his absence he was attainted. On the 
death of Rizzio he returned with Murray and the other refugees 
to Edinburgh. From the first he was Bothwell's enemy, and 
wrote to Bedford from his own house in Edinburgh, on 26th 
April 1567, a letter, which is one of the most damaging items 
in the case against Mary of complicity in Damley's murder : 
"The Queen will never cease until such time as she hath 
wrecked all the honest men of this realm. She was minded to 
cause Bothwell seize her, to the end that she may the sooner 
end the marriage whilk she promised before she caused Both- 
well murder her husband." 

At Carberry Hill, Bothwell refused Kirkaldy's challenge, as 
Lord Evers had done, on the ground of inequality of rank, 
yet it was to Kirkaldy that Mary surrendered when it was seen 
that fighting was hopeless. Although his sentiments towards 
Bothwell were well known to her, a woman's insight told her 
Kirkaldy was not one of her irreconcilable adversaries. A 
soldier's heart is more easily touched by the sight of a woman 
in distress than by the recollection of the death of a man. 

When Bothwell fled to Orkney, Kirkaldy, with Sir William 
Murray, pursued him in the Unicorn of Leith and three other 
ships. The Unicorn was wrecked in the Sound between the 
mainland of Shetland and Bressay, but Kirkaldy with the other 
vessels continued the chase to the coast of Norway, where 
Bothwell's stranded vessel and some of his agents in Damley's

murder were captured, but Bothwell himself escaped. At 
Langside, Kirkaldy at the head of the cavalry played an im- 
portant part in deciding the victory, and was made by Murray, 
Governor of the Castle of Edinburgh. After Murray's death, 
Maitland of Lethington's persuasive tongue brought him back 
to the Queen's side, and he held the castle under her flag till 
29th May 1573, when he surrendered to the English general, 
the Marshal of Berwick. On 3d August he was tried, and con- 
demned for treason, in spite of the efforts of Lord Ruthven and 
his old friend David Lindsay, the minister of Leith. A bond 
of manrent by which one hundred of his kin agreed to serve 
the house of Angus and Morton, and to pay 3000 merks a- 
year for his ransom, and his own offer to go into exile, were 
proffered in vain. The Regent Morton cruelly replied that 
\he people would not be satisfied without blood. He was 
hanged the same day at the Cross in the High Street. His 
brother was hung in the evening on the same scaffold. Super- 
stition remarked that Kirkaldy's corpse, which had its face set 
towards the east, within a " bonny quhile " (short space) turned 
to the west against the sun, and so remained. Knox, shortly 
before his own death, had prophesied that the castle would be 
taken, and Kirkaldy " brought over the walls of it with shame, 
and hing against the sun." Was this a survival of the old 
Celtic superstition that to go widershins — that is, against the 
course of the sun — boded ill-luck ? It may be feared that 
Knox's prediction helped to work its own fulfilment. 

The bravery and military skill of the Laird of Grange, as 
he was commonly called, have never been questioned. He 
had a soldier's straightforwardness and veracity, valuable at a 
time when duplicity was almost universal and truth the rarest 
virtue. He stands free of the plots and murders of his time. 
But the honour of a soldier in those days was not deemed 
incompatible with a change of side as frequent as that of a

332 ALEXANDER LESLIE SERVES UNDER GUSTAVUS, 

politician. Though a soldier of fortune, Kirkaldy had the 
interest of his country as he saw it as his chief aim, and this 
plea, more doubtfully put forward for Lethington, explains 
the inconsistencies of his life. 

The principles on which such a soldier acted have never 
been better explained than in the * Legend of Montrose ' by 
Sir Dugald Dalgetty, whose name Scott appears to have taken 
from the Fife parish. 

Alexander Leslie, Earl of Leven, another soldier of fortune, 
was of a different school from Kirkaldy. He was bred, not in 
the last wars of French chivalry, but in the campaigns of the 
great Gustavus, the first master of modem war who trained 
many Scottish pupils. Bom before the commencement of 
the seventeenth century, the younger son of George Leslie of 
Balgonie, sometimes called Captain of Blair-Athole, he fought 
first with the Dutch against the Spaniards, then with the 
Swedes against the Emperor. Under Gustavus he dis- 
tinguished himself by the defence of Stralsund against 
Wallenstein and the capture of the isle of Rugen. He was 
made a field - marshal, and reckoned the best general after 
the King. An original portrait of his royal master, now in 
the house of Melville in Fife, was presented to him in recog- 
nition of his services. When Gustavus fell at Lutzen, he 
continued to serve his daughter. Queen Christina; but the 
Covenanters, especially his chief, the Earl of Rothes, early 
had their eye on Leslie. He had induced several of the 
Scotch officers in the Swedish service to take the Cove- 
nant and prepare munitions of war before his return to 
Scotland in 1639. He was at once given the command of 
the army of the Covenant, into which he brought many of 
his old comrades. His first exploit was the daring assault 
of the Castle of Edinburgh, which he effected by placing 
a petard under the outer gate, and in the confusion caused

GENERAL OF THE COVENANTERS. 333 

by its explosion carried the inner fortifications with a force of 
a thousand musketeers and without the loss of a man. The 
victory at Dunse Law in May 1639 was equally bloodless. 
Baillie the Covenanter gives a striking picture of Leslie's in- 
fluence as a commander : " His skill and fortune made them 
all so resolute for battell as could be wished. We were 
feared that emulation among our nobles might have done 
harm when they should be mett in the fields, but such was 
the wisdom and authoritie of that old little crooked souldier 
that all with ane incredible submission from the beginning to 
the end gave over themselves to be guided by him as if he 
had been Great Solymane himself. Yet that was the man's 
understanding of our Scots humours that he gave out not 
onlie to the nobles but to verie mean gentlemen his directions 
in a very homely and simple form as if they had been the 
advyces of their neighbour and companion ; for, as he rightly 
observed, a difference should be used in commanding sojours 
of fortune and sojours voluntars, of which kind the most part 
of our camp did stand." 

Next year Leslie led the army which marched to England, 
took Newcastle, Tynemouth, Shields, and Durham, and forced 
Charles to conclude the Treaty of Ripon, when he was created 
Earl of Leven. In 1643 ^^ was sent to Ireland, but was 
recalled to assist the Parliamentary army. H© held the com- 
mand of the central division at Marston Moor on 2d July 
1644, but had no share in that victory, for the troops under 
his immediate command fled before the day was won. He 
again occupied Newcastle, and Charles came to his camp 
when engaged in the siege of Newark, Leslie received him 
respectfully and tendered his sword, but when Charles showed 
some inclination to keep it, told the King, " I am the older 
soldier, sir; your Majesty had better leave the command 
to me." Like most of his countrymen, he was, however,

a royalist by nature, disapproved of the death of the King, 
and served as a volunteer under the younger Leslie against 
Cromwell at Dunbar. In August 1651 he was taken and 
sent prisoner to the Tower, and only released at the inter- 
cession of the Queen of Sweden in 1654. He did not again 
engage in active service, but, after a visit to Sweden to thank 
Christina, lived in retirement, improving his estate at Balgonie, 
where he died on 4th April 1661. Some of the beeches 
which still overhang the Leven were planted by him. He 
took as his motto Pro Rege et pro Patrid, 

Another Leslie, David, was a younger son of Patrick I^slie 
of Pitcairlie, near Auchtermuchty, where he was born. He 
served his apprenticeship in the army of Gustavus and became 
a colonel of horse. He does not appear in Scotland till 1 644, 
when he accompanied his kinsman Leven as a major-general 
in the Scots army to England. At Marston Moor, the regi- 
ments under his command stood their ground better than most 
of their countrymen, and aided in turning what might have 
been a defeat into a victor&gt;\ Suddenly recalled from England 
to oppose Montrose, he terminated the short but brilliant 
career of that gallant general by the rout of Philiphaugh on 
13th September 1645. This victory was tarnished by the 
cruelty shown to the Irish, both men and women, which was 
justified in the eyes of Leslie and the Presbyterian ministers 
by the savage mode of warfare which had placed the Irish 
outside of the pale of the laws of war. The Scottish Estates 
voted him a gold chain and a large sum of money for the 
victor)^, but the Royalists nicknamed him the executioner. 

He aftenvards again served under Leven in England, and 
was at Newark when Charles I. surrendered, but was soon 
after recalled to Scotland to suppress the rising of the North 
and West Highlands. He declined to be a party to the 
engagement for the rescue of Charles I., but in 1650, when

DEFEATED BY CROMWELL. 335 

Charles II. accepted the Covenant, he became General-in- 
Chief of the Scottish army. His signal defeat by Cromwell 
at Dunbar, in part due to interference of the ministers in 
military affairs, did not lose him the confidence of the Scottish 
Estates, and he continued Lieutenant-General of their forces 
in England till the still more decisive defeat of Worcester 
on 3d September 1651. Soon after it he was taken prisoner 
and kept in the Tower till 1660. After the Restoration he 
was created Lord Newark, but retiring from service, lived at 
Newark, near St Monans, which he had* bought in 1649 from 
Sandilands, Lord Abercrombie, " a riotous youth," who spent 
an old estate in the space of four or five years. Though 
Philiphaugh was his only brilliant success, David Leslie was 
recognised as a general of capacity, but he was beaten by the 
superior military genius of CromwelL There was, too, an 
inherent weakness in a cause which attempted to reconcile 
Charles II. and the Covenant, and tried unwisely to direct 
campaigns by a combination of military and ecclesiastical 
leaders. 

As became a maritime county, Fife has been represented 
on sea as well as on land. One or two of the notable 
sailors of Fife have already come within view : Sir Michael 
of Wemyss, the first Scottish admiral; Sir Patrick Spens, 
the hero of the ballad; Sir Andrew Wood of Largo, the 
admiral of James III. and IV. The daring Bartons and 
other merchant cruisers came from the other side of the 
Forth, but knew well the havens and seaports of Fife. Of 
Wood the characteristic anecdote is told that after the Great 
St Michael had been sold and old age prevented him from 
going to sea, he cut a canal from his house of Largo to 
the parish kirk, along which he was rowed every Sunday 
to the parish church in an eight-oared barge, like the old 
tars in whose villa gardens on the coast of Fife we may

still see a mast turned into a flagstaff, or a boat into an 
arbour. 

Two later admirals of Fife deserve commemoration — Sir 
Samuel Greig and Sir Philip Durham of Largo, on the 
maternal side a descendant of Wood, to whose estate of 
Largo he succeeded. Greig, bom at Inverkeithing m 1735, 
the son of the master of the Thistle, a small craft which 
traded with Russia, passed from the merchant service into 
the Royal Navy, and from that into the Russian Navy in 
1763. He designed the fortifications of Cronstadt, and his 
services in the wars of Russia with Turkey and Sweden gained 
him the highest honours of his adopted country and the name 
of Father of the Russian Navy, in which his descendants have 
continued to serve almost to the present time. The Scot 
abroad had in him a worthy representative. 

Durham was one of the lieutenants of the Royal George, 
and happily escaped its fate to do good service in the French 
war. At Trafalgar his gallantry in trying to save the L'Aigle, 
a French frigate of 74 guns, from going down, was mentioned 
in the despatch of Collingwood ; and till the end of the war 
he continued to maintain the honour of the British flag, 
closing a long list of successful exploits by the capture of 
Guadaloupe in the autumn of 181 5. 

Largo sent another sailor to the sea, of humbler origin, but 
whose singular fate gained him a wider renown than the 
admirals of Fife, through the accident which made his life 
the basis for the romance of Defoe. It may have been when 
travelling in Fife that Defoe first heard of Alexander Selkirk, 
though his book was founded on the account published in 
'The Englishman' by Steele from the narrative of Captain 
Rogers, who rescued Selkirk from his four years' solitude at 
Juan de Fernandez. He was born in 1676, the son of John 
Selcraig or Selkirk, a shoemaker in the village of Lower

ORIGINAL OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

Largo, where the house of his father may still be seen. The 
only record of his youth in Fife is the account of the proceed- 
ings against him before the Kirk-session of Largo for a boyish 
quarrel with his brothers, when he confessed "that having 
taken a drink of salt water out of a can, his younger brother 
Andrew laughing at h!m, he did beat him twice with a staffe, 
and that he challenged his eldest brother, John, to a combate, 
as he called it, of dry neiffits [fisticuffs], which afterwards he 
did regret." For this " he was solemnly admonished before 
the congregation." A patriotic Fife biographer says he be- 
came a changed character, but it may be suspected that his 
going to sea was not unconnected with his drinking salt and 
getting into hot water. 

The Crusoe of Defoe is not a Fife but a Yorkshire man, 
and there is in his character a good deal of the morality and 
preaching of Defoe himself, which come still more strongly 
out in the less popular sequel he published, * Serious Reflec- 
tions during the Life of Robinson Crusoe, with his Vision of 
the Angelick World.' In the plain sailor-like narrative of 
Captain Rogers there is more of the real Selkirk and the native 
of Largo. " He had been on the island of Juan Fernandez," 
Rogers writes, " four years and four months, being left there 
by Captain Stradling of the Cinque Ports, a ship that came 
here last with Captain Dampier, who told me that he was the 
best man on her." Selkirk informed Rogers when he rescued 
him " that he was bom in Scotland and was bred a sailor from 
his youth. The reason of his being left there was a difference 
between him and his captain. ... He had with him his 
clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets, and 
tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a Bible, some practical pieces 
[religious tracts ?], and his mathematical instruments and books. 
He diverted and provided for himself as well as he could, but 
for the first eight months had much ado to bear up against

melancholy. He built two huts with pimento-trees, covered 
them with long grass, and protected them with the skins of 
goats. ... In the lesser hut he dressed his victuals, and in 
the larger he slept, and employed himself in reading, singing 
psalms, and praying, so that he said he was a better Christian 
while in this solitude than ever he was before, or ever he was 
afraid he should be again. At first he never ate anything till 
hunger constrained him, partly for grief and partly for want of 
bread and salt. Nor did he go to bed till he could watch no 
longer. . . . After he had conquered melancholy he diverted 
himself sometimes with cutting his name on the trees, and the 
time of his being left, and his continuance there. He likewise 
tamed some kids, and to divert himself would now and then 
sing and dance with them and his cats ; so that by the favour 
of Providence and vigour of his youth, being now but thirty 
years old, he came at last to conquer all the inconveniences 
of his solitude and to be very easy." 

Captain Rogers took Selkirk into the service as mate, and 
it was four more years before he returned home with ;^8oo of 
prize-money. On his return to Largo in the uniform of the 
Royal Navy no one but his mother recognised him. Some 
relics of Selkirk — his firelock, seaman's chest, now in the Scottish 
Antiquarian Museum, and the cup he used on the island — are 
still preserved. He seems to have inherited enough, or perhaps 
used his prize-money, for the purchase of a house and garden 
there. But the passion for the sea clung to him, and in 1 7 1 7 
he rejoined the navy, and died abroad a lieutenant of The 
Weymouth in 1728. A monument has recently been erected 
to his memory at Largo, but Defoe's masterpiece is more likely 
to hand down his name to future times. 

As was natural in a county so near the capital, the pro- 
fession of medicine, and still more that of law, have attracted 
some of the talent of Fife. In the former, John of Kinghora, 



Digitized by VjOOQIC 



DOCTORS OF FIFE. 339 

who became Court Surgeon of the King of Denmark in the 
reign of James V., is one of the earliest members of his pro- 
fession known by name in Scotland. Sir Robert Sibbald and 
Sir Andrew Balfour have been always numbered amongst the 
founders of the Scottish branch of the profession; and the 
more recent names may be added of James Syme the surgeon 
and John Goodsir the anatomist, two of the most brilliant 
representatives of the Scottish School. Goodsir was the 
son of a well-known and much-respected country doctor at. 
Anstruther, whose " medicines, mixed with prayer," it was said, 
always did his patients good. He is described in a footnote 
to a poem on Largo Bay, published in *The Bee* for 1792 
and signed Nauta, as a gentleman eminent in his profession 
and every Christian virtue. His fame seems to have spread 
the fame of Fife as a health resort : — 

** If spleen oppress thy soul, or bod'ly pain 
Racks every joint, and cramps thy ev'ry vein, 
Here breathe the air which will thy health restore, 
Cheer all thy soul, and open ev'ry pore ; 
Or if by slow consumption you decay, 
Come here and live — there's life in Largo Bay ; 
Bathe in the stream which braces every nerve, 
Goodsir declares this will thy life preserve. 
And who can doubt what Goodsir doth declare. 
Whose medicines are always mixed with prayer ? " 

It adds to the interest of the poem that the tradition of the 
Goodsir family attributes its authorship to Lady Anne Lindsay, 
the writer of " Auld Robin Gray," as it was reported to me 
by the late Dr Joseph Goodsir, another worthy son of the good 
doctor, to whose reminiscences of Fife I am much indebted. 

In the legal profession, many men of Fife, as of other 
counties in Scotland, have been entered on the long and 
quickly changing roll of the Senators of the College of Justice. 
Leaving out of view the Churchmen who sat in court almost

ex officio before the Reformation, Sir James Balfour was the 
first of these. He became Lord President in 1567, and his 
ill fame as a politician is somewhat relieved by the care 
which he took in collecting decisions, and by the first of 
several attempts to codify the law so often made in Scotland 
before the Union, though never yet attempted since, and 
which have in consequence been without permanent result. 
After him came Henry Balnaves of Halhill, the reformer, and 
John Wood of Tilliedavy, the friend and agent of the Regent 
Murray, who was killed by the Laird of Reres a few days 
after Murray's assassination. Alexander Seton, Lord Presi- 
dent and Chancellor under James VL, was connected with 
the county, not by birth but by his title of Earl of Dun- 
fermline. His successor, James Elphinstone, was in like 
manner associated with it by the grant of the Abbey lands, 
which gave him the title of Lord Balmerino, and descended 
through several generations until forfeited by the Jacobite 
lord. Sir Alexander Gibson of Durie and Sir Thomas Hope 
of Craighall were, after Johnston of Warriston, the leading 
lawyers of the Covenant. Hope became Charles I.'s Lord 
Advocate. Sir James I^armont of Balcomie and Sir John 
Wemyss of Wemyss served as judges under Cromwell. After 
the Restoration the connection of Fife with the College of 
Justice was for a time less intimate. The appointment of 
Archbishop Spottiswoode to the office of Chancellor, a return 
to the practice of conferring it on a Churchman, was never 
repeated, though Sharp is said to have coveted it. After the

on the Bench by Boswell of Balmuto and Monypenny 
of Pitmilly; and within living memory, by Lord MoncreifF 
of TuUibole, his son, the Lord Justice - Clerk, and Lord 
Deas, a native of Falkland. It has been a singular but 
probably accidental distinction that Fife produced two, and 
educated the third, of the only Scotsmen who have become 
Lord Chancellors of England, — Erskine, Loughborough, and 
Campbell. 

Leaving sketches of individuals, let us now take a general 
view of what has been done within the county in art and 
literature, and try to estimate the character of its natives, 
aided by the preceding outlines of the history of the county 
and of the biography of its chief worthies. 

Architecture is one of the earliest developments of art, and 
one of the earliest records of history. Silent yet expressive, 
it cannot lie, and if we could read it as truthfully as it was 
written, we might recover more than one lost chapter of 
the past. But the imperfections which belong to all the 
works of man impede the vision. Time and change render 
the architectural, like the geological record, fragmentary, and 
we can use it only as one, though one of the best side-lights 
of history. 

Even after men ceased to write annals on stone, they 
chronicled them in the homes they lived in and the temples 
in which they worshipped. Their original form, as well as 
their additions and alterations, destruction or decay, mark the 
character and changes of manners, customs, and thought So* 
in the ecclesiastical architecture of Fife, we follow step by step 
the religious history of Scotland. The standing stones at 
Largo, without a cross or other symbol, are dumb witnesses 
to the heathen burial of unknown heroes. Inchcolm still 
preserves the cell of a Celtic hermit The caves at Wemyss 
bear the rude symbols of primitive Christian art. In that

of the den at Dunfermline, we are admitted to the secret 
oratory where Queen Margaret prayed. At St SerTs Inch and 
the Kirkheugh of St Andrews we see the scarcely ampler 
outlines of the first churches of the Culdees, and in the 
round tower of Abemethy the loftiest and latest memorial 
of the Irish Church in Scotland. The square tower of St 
Regulus may be the work of Italian monks, a sign of the 
commencement of the conquest of the Celtic by the Roman 
Church. The Early Norman Abbey of Dunfermline, the 
Early English Cathedral and Priory of St Andrews the 
monasteries of Balmerino and Lindores, the parish churches 
of Leuchars, St Monans, and Crail, are palimpsests from 
which may be deciphered underneath the history of the 
decline and fall, the record of the rise and progress, of the 
ecclesiastical power. 

The church of Dairsie is the first and almost the last monu- 
ment of restored Episcopacy on a purely Anglican modeL 
The kirks of St Andrews, Cupar, Crail, and Dunfermline 
show how the Presbyterian Reformation used and abused 
that part of the heritage of the Church which it rescued from 
the grasp of the nobles. 

The Dutch church of Burntisland marks the close but brief 
connection of the Presbyterians of Scotland and of Holland. 

The barn-like and roomy churches of the Seceders recall 
the time when the children of the conventicles in the fields 
and on the hillside were at last allowed to build plain but 
spacious houses of God in the towns of which they had 
become thriving citizens. 

The gradual and slow revival of a better style of architec- 
ture is marked by the churches of all the denominations which 
divide the Church in the present day, as yet aiming imperfectly 
to copy or to restore what had been destroyed or allowed to 
perish.

CASTELLATED ARCHITECTURE. 343 

Not less significant are the monuments of domestic archi- 
tecture. The Celtic Duns have left only a few scattered 
stones, or are buried in mounds overgrown with trees or grass, 
as the yet unexplored Maiden Castle of the den of Kennoway, 
which Sir Walter Scott supposed to have been the Castle of 
Macduff, the Earl who slew Macbeth. Norman's Law and the 
Laws of Largo and Kellie tnay have been the sites either of 
Celtic or of Scandinavian forts. 

The Feudal Castles still survive in every variety of size and 
type, some total ruins, many roofless, — a few, like Kellie and 
Earlshall, preserved by wise possessors, who did not forget the 
past in the present, and had an eye to the future. The palaces 
and castles of Fife are a constant theme for the pencil and the 
pen of the artist, the architect, and the antiquary. Every 
change illustrated in the comprehensive work of MacGibbon 
and Ross on the 'Castellated and Domestic Architecture of 
Scotland * has examples in the two counties. There are good 
specimens of the solitary tower, the simple keep, the angle 
flanked by towers, the open and the enclosed courtyard, the 
decorated castle or palace of the Renaissance. Sometimes 
in one building or on one site, as at Dunfermline, Falkland, 
or Wemyss, we may note the additions which mark the 
changes from the hunting-tower of Canmore or Macdufl* to 
the palaces or castles of the kings, earls, or barons. 

The age of the Lords was succeeded by tfie age of the 
Lairds, and the castle gave place to the mansion or country- 
house. Civil war had ceased. Thick walls were no longer 
needed for safety, nor dungeons for captives, nor towers for 
observation. When Charles II. visited the Laird of Anstruther 
at his Castle of Dreel he parted with a jest, " You have given 
me a fine dinner in your old craw's nest" Kings' saws be- 
come the laws of fashion, and soon after the house of An- 
struther Place was built.

344 MODERN ARCHITECTS — THE ADAMS. 

A stroke of good fortune gave the county gentlemen of 
Fife native architects of the new style, — Sir William Bruce, 
William Adam, and his more celebrated sons. Bruce, the 
architect or master-mason of Charles I., who finished Holy- 
rood, built the new house of Kinross, as well as the 
great quadrangle of the house of Leslie, which vied with 
royal palaces during its short life, perishing by fire as so 
many country-houses have done. The fine mansion of 
Hopetoun House, which has been called, with exaggeration, 
a Scottish Versailles, was commenced by him, though com- 
pleted by Adam. 

The elder Adam, bom in Kirkcaldy, afterwards of Mary- 
burgh near Kinross, published the *Vitruvius Scoticus,' and 
the classic style was the copy from which he worked in Hope- 
toun and other country-houses. His four sons, of whom 
Robert and James are the best known, followed his example. 
Charlotte Square and some of the best parts of the New Town of 
Edinburgh, the Register House, College, and Old Infirmary, the 
Adelphi and other streets in London, as well as many country- 
houses in England, are their work. William, the son of John, 
one of the brothers, who was Chief Commissioner of the Jury 
Court, without practising their art, inherited some of their taste. 
The plantations and parks of Blair Adam are good examples 
of landscape-gardening, the natural ornament of domestic 
architecture wfien a peaceful life had become possible. Fife 
was preserved from the poor imitations of the Baronial style 
with which the ill-called Modem Gothic has disfigured parts of 
Scotland, by the possession and maintenance of good speci- 
mens of the old style, by the poverty of some of its lairds, and 
by the preference given by the wealthier to the new style of 
Bmce and the Adams. Yet another Fife name enters into the 
record of the progress of architecture in Scotland — Playfair, the 
nephew of the Natural Philosopher, to whom we owe the Royal

Institution and Picture-Galleries of Edinburgh, and also the 
National Monument and other modem Grecian buildings 
which, imfortunately erected on the Calton Hill without due 
regard to the nature of the site and climate, gained for Edin- 
burgh the nickname of the Modem Athens. 

Some examples of the town houses of the merchants of the 
burghs in Fife, to which the Stewarts so lavishly gave charters 
and the sea brought wealth, may still be seen, notably in St 
Andrews, Cupar, Dunfermline, Crail, and Inverkeithing. But 
their solid walls and picturesque though dark windows, high 
roofs, and quaint gables, have almost everywhere been crowded 
out or hidden by the less beautiful, more commodious, perhaps 
more comfortable, houses and villas of the prosperous manu- 
facturer, lawyer, and tradesman. 

Another change is pleasant to note. Who can tell how or 
where the labourers of the ground were housed when the lord 
was rearing his castle to be entailed on a long line of unknown 
heirs ; or the Prelate, childless, or with children whose mother 
could not be called a wife, was building a stately tomb to 
adorn his cathedral and perpetuate his name? It may be 
doubted whether many cottages are now standing older than 
the Union of the Kingdoms, and certainly few or none older 
than the Union of the Crowns. But some houses of the noble 
and the rich have become, as in the old town of Edinburgh, 
tenements of the poor. The house in which Anabella Dram- 
mond, the mother of James I., at Inverkeithing, is said to 
have lived, was let as lodgings to navvies working at the 
Forth Bridge. 

In the villages and small towns are still to be picked out by 
the curious eye narrow and unhealthy cottages or small houses, 
yet at their ingles and round their door-steps families of bairns 
have been brought up in habits of thrift and honesty. From 
such homes came, in the last and this century, Michael Bmce

346 WHAT GREAT ARCHITECTURE REQUIRES. 

of Kinnesswood, and Thomas Chalmers, and the Goodsirs 
of Anstruther, who have done honour to their birthplace. 
Such cottages, and the bothies of the farms, but not, let us 
hope, such habits, will soon be things of the past. Once the 
necessary conditions for healthy life have been secured, the 
hand of art is beginning to refine and beautify humble homes. 

A great architecture requires time, large room, a fine site, 
and unstinted cost. Its elevating influence on those who see 
as well as those who inhabit its masterpieces is, however, dearly 
purchased if the urgent needs of the poor are forgotten. Yet 
a country which is beginning openly to style itself democratic 
and imperial should recall the examples of republican Greece 
as well as of imperial Rome. The church, the hospital, the 
town-hall, the college, and the school, afford scope for the 
highest genius of the future architect. May it be his fortune 
to bequeath to Fife beautiful buildings more lasting than the 
castle and the abbey. He may at least avoid destroying its 
landscape, as the suburbs of our great towns are being de- 
stroyed by the works of the speculative builder. 

Architecture might, with only a slight exaggeration, be 
described as the chief fine art of the middle ages. The 
painter and the sculptor were at first almost exclusively em- 
ployed to adorn the work of the architect, to colour the blank 
spaces of the ceiling and the walls, to decorate the church and 
the castle, to erect tombs or to fill niches. No portrait of 
any merit was probably painted in Scotland till the sixteenth 
century. Probably no statue, with perhaps one exception 
that of Charles II. in the Parliament Square of Edin- 
burgh, other than the recumbent figure or the efiigy of the 
tomb, was erected till late in the eighteenth century. But 
once painting and sculpture had taken possession of their 
independent though kindred kingdoms, and the Scottish eye 
had opened to the beauty of the painted landscape, the

FIFE PAINTERS. 347 

domestic or the historic scene, and of the human form in 
marble or in bronze, there was no want of Scottish hands to 
use either the brush or the chisel. 

Fife has furnished its contingent to the as yet short but 
distinguished annals of Scottish painting. David Martin of 
Anstruther, the pupil of Allan Ramsay, the younger, and pre- 
cursor of Sir Henry Raebum, holds an early and recognised 
place in the succession of portrait-painters of which Scotland 
is proud. Sir David Wilkie first breathed the inspiration for 
the scenes of rural life he immortalised from the peasants and 
villagers of Pitlessie, in the parish of Cults. Though too 
young and too original to have been directly influenced by 
Martin, it is an interesting link in the chain of art that he 
was presented by that artist's brother, the minister of Moni- 
mail, a co-presbyter of his father, with lay figures Martin had 
used. Another name worthy of being mentioned is Charles 
Lees of Cupar, a painter of more than one style, who felt the 
influence both of Raebum and Wilkie, and who, though sur- 
passed by these great masters, has left two pictures of country 
scenes which had escaped the pencil of Wilkie. His " Curling 
Match," and "The Golfers: a Grand Match played over St 
Andrews Links," are still popular favourites, and excellent 
representations of the two national games of Scotland. A 
younger artist, Nicolson, also a native of Cupar, was too early 
cut off* by a sad fate. His sympathetic eye for the life of the 
agricultural labourer made his friends hope that Fife might 
have a Scottish Millet. The brilliant imagination and inven- 
tive power of Sir Noel Paton, the eldest of a family of artists, 
were perhaps prompted by familiarity with the designs of his 
father for the looms of Dunfermline. The painter of " The 
Ordination of the Elders " is a faithful student of the character 
of Fife and its natives. In landscape, it may be because of 
the fascination of less familiar scenes, the artists of Fife have

348 OPPORTUNITIES OF SCOTLAND IN ART. 

too much left the rare variety of its coasts and the modest 
beauty of its hills and plains to the artists of other counties, 
who have found, especially in the East Neuk, a perennial 
charm. 

It would be difficult as yet to name a sculptor of Fife origin. 
Native Scottish sculpture is indeed almost a blank till the 
present century. There is enough of beauty and still more of 
character in the women and men of Fife to create or stimu- 
late a genius in this department. But specimens of carving 
in wood and working in iron recently produced by the village 
carpenter and blacksmith, and of the Wemyss Pottery at 
Gallatown, where, as at Dunmore, a wise patronage intro- 
duced Italian patterns, show that plastic art only requires 
opportunity and training to call forth its latent talent. 

Scotland and Fife came late into the field of the fine arts 
after the splendid triumphs of Greece and Rome had been 
buried in the wreck of the Roman empire, and the no less 
splendid periods of Italy and the Low Countries had passed. 
Jamesone, the first Scottish portrait - painter, was a fellow- 
pupil in the school of Rubens, of Vandyck, the latest of the 
Continental classic artists. But Scotland has now an equal 
opportunity with the rest of Europe. Its climate, the one 
unfavourable condition to artistic production, may be made, 
in this as in other things, a discipline and not an obstacle 
to genius and perseverance. The cold air of Aberdeen has 
been the birthplace of some of the best Scottish painters. 
The misty atmosphere and dingy streets of Glasgow have 
produced a younger and vigorous school which has made 
new experiments in Scottish art. It would almost seem as 
if the artistic spirit, by a happy compensation, may be pro- 
voked by adverse as well as evoked by favourable surroimd- 
ings to manifest its talents. 

If we turn from art to literature, Fife has contributed a

FIFE LITERATURE — POETRY. 349 

fair share of the works which have given Scotland a distinct 
place amongst the literary countries of the world. To think, 
to read, and to write, are natural to Scotsmen — thanks to the 
good schools and colleges the Monks commenced, the Re- 
formers remodelled, and the present age desires to improve, 
but also to the instinct of a nation which has always recog- 
nised the value of ideas as well as of facts. 

Fife cannot claim in poetry, the highest manifestation of 
literature, any of the greatest names, but it has many worthy 
of record, all marked by distinctive traits. Robert Henryson, 
the schoolmaster of Dunfermline, holds an honourable place 
as the sweetest and the purest of the early Scottish poets. 
Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount struck a stronger though 
a coarser vein, and as long as the vernacular dialect was 
familiar, bore the bell of popularity amongst the poets of 
Scotland. "Christ's Kirk on the Green," one of the many 
older springs from which Burns drew some of his rhythms, 
whether or not it had a royal author, almost certainly had its 
birthplace in Fife. It represents, with older and later ballads, 
the boisterous merriment of the Comic Muse. Sir William Alex- 
ander of Menstrie, afterwards Earl of Stirling, and Sir Robert 
Ayton of that Ilk, the friend of Ben Jonson and of Hobbes, 
were members of the poetic circle of which Drummond of 
Hawthornden was chief, who regarded poetry as one of the 
ornaments of a gentleman at the Court or in the Country 
in the days of James VI. Fife can only claim a passing 
share in the high merit of the Latin verses of Buchanan, 
or the English love-sonnets of Drummond of Hawthornden ; 
but the * Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum,* the latest blos- 
soms of Latinity in Scotland, found several contributors in 
Fife. 

Kinnesswood, on Lochleven, was the birthplace of Michael 
Bruce, whose too brief life was long enough to sing the praises

3 so SONGS, BEST LITERATURE OF FIFE. 

of Lochleven, and the ** Elegy on Spring," common themes, 
with a delicacy not so common. His title to the " Ode to the 
Cuckoo" is still contested, and the controversy between his 
claims and those of Logan cannot be deemed settled. The 
neighbouring braes of the Ochils have produced in this gener- 
ation the Doric lays of Hugh Haliburton. The East Neuk 
was the birthplace of Professor Tennant, whose " Anster Fair " 
has spread the fame of Maggie Lauder. The Scottish univer- 
sities, unlike the English, do not as yet seem to have been a 
favourable soil for poetry. The "Epigoniad" of Professor 
Wilkie is forgotten, and even the more original poems of 
Professor Tennant are now seldom read. Yet one of the 
Principals of St Andrews was the writer of one of the best of 
modern Scottish songs, " The Bush aboon Traquair " ; and 
three of its students, Robert Fergusson in last century, and 
in the present, Andrew Lang and Kenneth Murray, have ex- 
pressed in sympathetic verse the ancient honours and the 
modem humours of the city of the Scarlet Gown. 

The brightest and the best poetry of Fife has been its songs, 
already treated, — not the comic strains of " Jenny's Bawbee," 
by Sir Alexander Boswell, founded on an older ballad, or 
"The Auld Man's Mare's Deid" of the piper of Kinghom, 
or "There cam' a Fiddler out o' Fife, a blink beyond Bal- 
weary," although all these are good in their way; but the 
grand old ballad of " Sir Patrick Spens," a rival of " Chevy 
Chase," the patriotic lines of " Hardyknute," by Lady Anne 
Wardlaw, and the pathetic " Auld Robin Gray " of Lady Anne 
Barnard, a daughter of the house of Balcarres. Poets, like 
artists, from the other side of the Forth have often come to 
Fife for themes, as William Hamilton for the spirited sketch 
of " Bonny Heck " ; Robert Fergusson, who did not sing its 
praises ; the Ettrick Shepherd, who made it the scene of one

PHILOSOPHY, THEOLOGY, AND NATURAL SCIENCE. 35 1 

of the best, parts of the "Queen's Wake"; Lady Naime, in 
"The Auld Fife Laird"; and David Vedder, in "The Witch 
of Pittenweem." 

In philosophy Fife has had few representatives, but claims 
as especially its own one name, itself a host, Adam Smith, 
whose works have been already noticed. The small Uni- 
versity of St Andrews has taken part, along with Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, in keeping alive this favourite Scottish study, when 
in the rich universities of England it threatened to become 
extinct, and few professors have explained its abstruse prob- 
lems with more lucidity than William Ferrier and Robert 
Flint. 

In the highest walks of theology, neither Fife nor Scotland 
can fairly claim a considerable place. Its theology has been 
too polemical to reach the serene air in which Hooke and 
Butler were able to live even amid the storms of controversy. 
Few counties, or indeed countries, can, however, boast of more 
devout and eloquent preachers than Alexander Henderson, 
George Gillespie, the two Erskines, and Thomas Chalmers. 
Nor has Fife ever lacked, any more than other parts of 
Scotland, the self-denying labours of the pastoral office. 

Natural science has been a later growth, but amongst its 
first representatives, the founders of the Royal Society of 
Edinburgh and Professors of its chair in the University, 
were John Playfair, who, though bom in Forfarshire, was 
educated at St Andrews, and whose name is closely associ- 
ated with that town; and Sir John Leslie, his successor, 
a native of Largo. Mrs Somerville, long a resident in 
Burntisland, has been claimed by a liberal interpretation 
for the county, anxious to secure amongst its natives almost 
the only Scotswoman who has yet distinguished herself as a 
mathematician.

352 ROMANCE AND HISTORY. 

Her name recalls that of another lady bom and bred in 
Fife, Margaret Oliphant, whose rapid and graceful pen has 
illustrated three separate branches of the literature of the 
Victorian age, — romance, biography, and history. In the 
* Tales of Peasant Life of the Brothers Bethune,' Fife has 
a good specimen of the literary taste of the poorest class 
in Scotland, who had no teachers but nature and the parish 
schoolmaster. The humorous history of *Tammas Bodkin,' 
the successor of Mansie Wauch, the more famous tailor of 
Dalkeith, deserves notice for its good representation of the 
modern vernacular of the county. Nor in these days of the 
local novel has Fife failed to find capable pens to draw in 
accurate colours passages of its recent life, as * The Story of 
Margr^del,' by David Meldrum, and *Mona Maclean,* by a 
writer who still modestly conceals her name. 

The subject of this sketch, and the large part taken in 
Scottish history by authors born in or chiefly connected with 
Fife, entitle the Fife historians to special recognition. 

Scottish history first touched solid ground in the Metrical 
Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun, the Prior of St Serfs. The 
prose of Bower, the Prior of Inchcolm, continued the * Scoti- 
chronicon ' of John of Fordoun. The brief but pregnant 
history of John Major, Provost of St Salvator's, represents the 
view a candid, thoughtful, Roman schoolman took of Scottish 
progress down to the reign of James IV. Robert Lindsay 
of Pitscottie's quaint and pithy narrative depicts the reigns 
of the Jameses as they appeared to the eye of a Reforming 
layman or laymen, for the work which bears his name had 
probably more than one author. John Knox found, and 
probably wrote, some of the most graphic passages of the 
earlier history of the Reformation in Fife, and James Melville 
of Anstruther has recorded the later in a style only inferior to

HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES. 353 

that of his master. George Buchanan was by birth a High- 
lander, but his education at St Andrews under Major, and his 
return for a few years as Principal, gives Fife a claim to some 
part of the credit of his * History of Scotland,' though its too 
late attempt to be a Latin classic, and the strong prejudices of 
its author, have prevented it from being a classic history. Sir 
James Balfour of Denmyln and Kinnaird will be remembered 
for the materials he collected rather than for the history he 
wrote, yet we could ill dispense with his contemporary annals 
of King Charles. The Diary of John Lamont of Lundy is 
one of the first examples of the Domestic Annals which 
chronicle the facts that Court and Church historians neglect, 
but which are necessary to a complete view of the life of a 
nation. Perhaps the fairest of the ecclesiastical histories of 
Scotland are the works of Archbishop Spottiswoode of St 
Andrews, and the more recent history of Dr Cunningham, 
the late Principal of St Mary's College. His immediate pre- 
decessor, Dr Tulloch, wrote with an impartial pen an outline 
of the lives of the Leaders of the Reformation ; while his col- 
league. Principal Shairp, was sketching, with a poet's prose, 
the early history of St Andrews and other scenes of Scottish 
story. 

It would be impossible to name all the learned antiquaries, 
from Sir Robert Sibbald of Gibliston, the father of the race, 
to Sir Arthur Mitchell, an Aberdonian by origin, but, like Dr 
William Skene, the historian of Celtic Scotland, a summer 
resident in Fife, who have illustrated the antiquities of Scot- 
land or the local history of Fife. But Dr Hew Scott of 
Anstruther, the indefatigable compiler of the " Fasti " of the 
Scottish Presbyterian Established Church; Chalmers and 
Henderson, the painstaking annalists of Dunfermline ; Lyon, 
the zealous historian of Episcopal St Andrews; the Rev. Mr

354 HISTORIANS OF FIFE AND ABERDEEN. 

Wood of Elie, who has traced the lands and families of the 
East Neuk ; Dr Laing of Newburgh, who has restored Lin- 
dores, as Dr Campbell of Balmerino has restored Balmerino ; 
Mr Burns-Begg, who has made the story of Lochleven more 
intelligible; Mr Erskine Beveridge, who has collected *The 
Memorials of Crail ' ; and Dr James Taylor of Flisk, who 
gathered up the fragments of history scattered over many 
parishes, should at least be remembered by one who has 
used their labours. 

Other districts and other counties probably have as good 
though a different record. It is easy to exaggerate local fame 
and magnify locaU worthies, but the attempt has been made 
to resist this bias, and to keep within just proportion. 

It may at least be claimed for Fife and for Aberdeenshire 
that they have together contributed more than any other dis- 
tricts to the history of Scotland. They have been favoured 
by historic memories, and by the presence of universities, 
which, too long left without chairs, have never been without 
students of history. Perhaps the climate of the east and north 
is more bracing than the softer breezes of the west for the 
strenuous labours of history, though less favourable to the 
more delicate flowers of poetry than the milder Lowlands and 
the wilder scenery of the Highlands and the Borders. His- 
tory does not require the poetic vision, and has not the 
prophetic gift. It forbids its servants, who know that even 
the greatest masters catch only glimpses of the past through 
the veil which time weaves and rends, to draw the thicker 
curtain that hides the future. 

But the historical student is allowed to hope. The hope 
of one attached to Fife by ties not of birth, but of office and 
the kindness of its natives, is, that with increasing prosperity 
its tranquil landscape may lose none of its homely beauty.

CONTRASTS OF LOCAL CHARACTER. 355 

and that neither the growth of wealth nor the diffusion of 
knowledge may impair the character which has given its 
children a place in the front ranks of Scottish progress, as 
their forefathers had a place in the vanguard of the armies 
of Scotland. 

That character is difficult fully and fairly to express. If 
the Aberdonian is more Scotch than the Scotch, the Fife 
man, or Fifer as he is sometimes ironically, more often kindly, 
called, has something in his nature, as in his county, which 
belongs to, yet lies outside of, the ordinary Scotch character. 
Many sayings turn on what his countrymen deem his eccen- 
tricity. This is not, as has been supposed, confined to the 
lairds, though the old Fife laird was perhaps the most strongly 
marked and widely known example of the quality. The bon- 
net with the bee is to be found amongst the burghers of the 
small towns, both on the coast and inland. All classes have 
been known to wear it with pride, and a Fife laird lately flat- 
tered a miscellaneous Fife audience by telling them it was not 
a bee in their bonnets, but a feather in their caps. 

The " Folk of Fife " appear as a distinct section of the 
Scottish people in Scott's forgotten dedication of the Waverley 
Novels. They stand in it by themselves, alongside of, but 
apart from, " the Men of the South," " the Gentlemen of the 
North," and "the People of the West." 

They in fact combined, for much of this has passed 
away, the Highland Celtic character drawn from their re- 
moter ancestors, and the Lowland Saxon, from their nearer 
neighbours the commons of the Lothians, with the Norman 
polish spread by the nobles and men of gentle blood through- 
out Scotland. They are a marked contrast from " the People 
of the West," who have produced, if a paradox may be par- 
doned, greater numbers but fewer individuals. They blend

356 CHARACTER OF FIFE NATIVES. 

the fervid spirit of the Celt with the cautious temper of the 
Saxon, which in its Lowland Scottish variety is called pawky 
and canny. Their share of Norman blood, though not quite 
extinct, has diminished since the Court left. In few districts 
is there now less of the habits and manners of the courtier. 
Acute rather than subtle, critical as well as argumentative, 
more observant than inventive, they are, above all, — and here 
they reflect their county, — independent and self-sufficing, a 
diflerent thing from self-sufficient Each man is himself, 
and not merely a copy of another, or a sample of a class. 
Variety of occupations, of locality, of fortune, of political 
opinion, of religious creed, has produced variety of character. 
The natives are not cast in a single mould, and even this 
outline of their history has shown how diverse have been 
their talents. Something of the same kind may be observed 
in the natives of all districts remote from the assimilating 
and levelling influence of great towns. What is peculiar to 
Fife is, that its inhabitants have so long preserved their 
characteristics though in close proximity to the Scottish 
political capital, at no great distance from the commercial 
centre, and with the old ecclesiastical metropolis of Scot- 
land within its own bounds. Nor do the arms of the sea 
which enclose, and, till the other day, separated the peninsula, 
completely, although they partly, account for this. Formerly 
a short day's, and now an hour's, journey may be sufficient 
to pass from the remotest comer of Fife to the centres of 
Scottish Life. 

A curious parallel might be drawn between Kent and Fife. 
Their physical situation is similar. In both a few Celtic cus- 
toms and some Celtic blood survived Saxon and Norman 
civilisation. In both an apparent accident made an extremity 
of the kingdom the ecclesiastical centre. In both varied in-

KINROSS CONTRASTED WITH FIFE. 357 

dustry and thrifty habits produced prosperity. But the men 
of Kent are no longer so distinct a class in the English as the 
men of Fife in the Scottish nation. 

Though Fife is one of the large counties and Kinross the 
second smallest county in Scotland, Kinross is still proud of 
its independence and distinct character. Its relation to Fife 
is like that ♦of Fife to the rest of the Lowlands, half united 
and half apart. It is an inland county, with no sea-coast to 
vary its occupations or bring in foreign customs. Its coal- 
mines are a mere fringe on those of Fife, and its industries 
are connected with the surface of the soil, part agricultural 
and part pastoral, — for it has, like Scotland, Highlands and 
Lowlands of its own. 

Lochleven is the centre of its geography and of its history, 
so that the charm of association is linked with the charm of 
scenery. Though its county town was on the great north 
road, and the railway to the north runs close to it, Kinross- 
shire lies apart from these channels of intercourse with the 
outer world, and has preserved the tranquillity of character 
which in a rapid age is deemed slowness, and some of the old 
habits and customs of the agricultural class, more than almost 
any other part of the Scottish Lowlands. 

These characteristics are now disappearing, but have been 
fortunately sketched, before they vanish, by Hugh Haliburton 
(J. Logic Robertson), a native of the Ochils, in whose verse 
and prose the working year and the holiday pastimes of the 
shepherds and ploughmen have been faithfully depicted. It 
is difficult to believe that the epithet of "Gay Kinross," 
bestowed on it by its poet, Michael Bruce, can ever have 
been true in the modem somewhat degraded sense of gaiety. 
Bruce perhaps meant only that Kinross was gay in comparison 
with Kinnesswood. Still the natives of the little shire take

358 CAUSES OF VARIETY OF CHARACTER. 

the business of life easily, and keenly enjoy its pleasures. 
It deserves remark that the eccentricity which is deemed a 
note of the Fife character is absent from, or at least is not 
so conspicuous in, that of Kinross. The independent spirit 
and shrewd observant eye are common to both the shires of 
the ancient Kingdom. 

The differentiation of character also to be found in both 
counties is largely due to the subdivision of property held 
by a series of independent resident owners, from earls to 
bonnet lairds. Its soil has been cultivated by men of differ- 
ent gradations of wealth from those who for generations tilled 
the same acres, or plied the same trades, like the family which 
made parchment at Kinnesswood for three centuries, to the 
cottars with only a small garden or the "scrappies," now 
almost extinct, who sent a single horse or cow, their whole 
stock, to the Lomonds to snatch a precarious living, or the 
still poorer vagrants who sleep, as one of them said the other 
day with sad humour, " when the wind is west in front of the 
stove, and when it is east in front of the kiln " of the bare 
brick-field. 

This variety of character has been increased by the multi- 
plicity of little burghs, with dignified yet homely provosts and 
bailies, shrewd lawyers, skilful doctors, substantial merchants, 
well-to-do tradesmen, and sturdy labourers and fishers, and 
the still greater number of villages, each an independent com- 
munity. Inequality of outward condition and of rank and 
talent correspond better with the facts of human nature and 
better secure the stability of society than the dull monotone 
of the socialists* paradise, even when imagined by the poet or 
coloured by the painter to suit his own tastes. 

Nor, of course, has it been without some influence that Fife, 
like Attica of old, includes in its population men of the hills

NATIONAL VALUE OF LOCAL CHARACTER. 359 

and of the plains, and dwellers on the sea and its coast, or 
that probably to a greater extent than elsewhere the different 
classes have intermarried within their own class, and often 
within their own locality. Yet any one who follows the history 
of the county from remote times cannot but suspect an original 
difference of stock, which has not been lost either by the large 
emigration x&gt;f natives or the comparatively small immigration 
of strangers. 

It is to this diversity and tenacity of local character, com- 
bined with a common national sentiment, that Scotland, and 
indeed Great Britain itself, the little island of the Northern 
Seas, now the mother country of wide continents, owes much 
of the strength which has gained for it the place it holds 
amongst the nations of the World.
