<H2>Pre-season</H2>
Riar Geer was suspended "from everything football-related" after being arrested on suspicion of second-degree assault and harassment on March 15, 2008. This was less than 24 hours after Lynn Katoa was arrested March 14, 2008 on suspicion for assault at a party on February 16, 2008. This now makes four football players that have had charges brought against them this year. On January 19, 2008, Kai Maiava was ticketed with underage possession and consumption of alcohol and Nate Vaiomounga was charged the same night for criminal mischief under $500. Vaiomounga was also charged February 16, 2008 with underage possession and consumption of alcohol for a separate incident. On April 13, 2008, Jake Duren was arrested for first-degree criminal trespass and kicked off the team 4 hours later. Durin was found bloody and passed out after police followed a blood trail from a broken car window to him in the Smiley Court family residence hall where he did not live.<br />

<H3>Kansas</H3>
Heading into the game against Colorado, Kansas was ranked #15 in the Coaches Poll. This made the 17th consecutive week that Kansas was ranked in the Top 25 (dating back to 2007), a school record. Before the start of the game Kansas Coach Mark Mangino asked the KU student section to refrain from an expletive kickoff chant that has become a student tradition. Despite Mangino's plea, the student section yelled the chant louder than ever. Colorado scored first with an 11 yard <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("72011",this,"cody_hawkins.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("72011")' href="/topics/Cody_Hawkins">Cody Hawkins</a><span class="hp" id="m72011"><div class="hpHeader">Cody Hawkins</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i72011"></div>Cody Hawkins  is a former quarterback for the University of Colorado Buffaloes football team, and current quarterback for the Stockholm Mean Machines of the Sweden Super Series.-High school:...</div><br></span>&nbsp;touchdown pass. Colorado got the ball back soon thereafter, but Hawkins threw an interception inside the red zone and the Kansas defense prevented another Colorado score. Kansas first got on the board with a Jake Sharp touchdown run in the 2nd Quarter. On Colorado's next possession, Hawkins was sacked for a 17 yard loss and a safety to give Kansas its first lead. Once again Kansas came out and played much better in the second half. In the second half Todd Reesing passed for his only touchdown to Dezmond Briscoe and Sharp rushed for two more touchdowns. Sharp's first start of the season was successful as he rushed for 118 yards on 31 carries and for 3 touchdowns. Sharp's performance was by far the best of any Kansas running back through the first 6 games of the season. Reesing had his most accurate game of the season, completing 27 of 34 passes for 256 yards and 1 touchdown. Wide Receiver Kerry Meier had 9 receptions for 94 yards. A few hours after the Kansas win, the only other undefeated North team in Big 12 play, Missouri, lost to Oklahoma State. Kansas stood atop the Big 12 North with a record of 2&ndash;0.<br />

Trailing 6-0 and in need of a spark to break out of their monthlong slump, Hansen entered the game and promptly fumbled his first snap out of bounds.

He drove them to the Kansas State 4, where Hawkins re-entered and handed off to Stewart, who ran into the end zone to give Colorado a 7-6 lead.<br />
