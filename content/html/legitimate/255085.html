		  <H1>Let Your Fingers Do Less Walking</H1> 
		  <H2> [From <I>The Mensa Bulletin </I> (September 1995) ]</H2></CENTER> 
		<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I read with special interest Gerald Baker's letter in
		  the July/August <I>Bulletin</I> (p. 7) partly because I recall Gerald's writing
		  and correspondence from Mensa's &#147;old days&#148; and partly because I had
		  recently written an essay on precisely the same subject. The following is
		  substantially the complete text of that essay. The addition to Gerald's
		  thoughts lies in the positive proposal for finally putting Dvorak into the
		  public consciousness.</FONT></P> 
		<P>I have known about the Dvorak keyboard since 1942 when I ran across an
		  article in <I>The New York Times</I> while in elementary school. Intrigued as I
		  was by the claims of Dvorak, I nevertheless learned touch typing on QWERTY for
		  the obvious reason: availability. I hated typing. I was error-prone. Every now
		  and then, my fingers would not connect with my mind and I would have to violate
		  the code of the touch-typist and sneak a peek at the keyboard. Worst, I found
		  the process exhausting to my fingers and draining to my emotions as I had to
		  fight for the off-home keys.</P> 
		<P>The computer has changed all that. The biggest psychic relief, of
		  course, was the ability to make corrections on a word processor without
		  retyping an entire page or fussing with correction tape or fluid. But I wanted
		  to go further and relieve the tension in my fingers. Acquiring a Dvorak
		  keyboard was no longer any problem. One may purchase a Dvorak keyboard, but a
		  cost-free alternative is simply to use software that comes with many operating
		  systems that allows instant reassignment of the QWERTY keys to the Dvorak
		  configuration. And you may still share the computer with your non-Dvorak
		  colleagues since the same software is quickly removable.<A

		<P>Has Dvorak made a difference? You bet! My fingers don't get tired, and
		  I can type transparently, that is to say, without any mental regard for the
		  typing process. The words flow from brain to screen, and thence to paper, with
		  a feeling of direct translation. Do I type any faster? Only marginally so when
		  measured in words per minute; reaction time and finger dexterity are still
		  physiological limits. But I am definitely more productive overall since I can
		  maintain a pace for longer before needing a break. Also, when composing
		  original text, the fluency of the keyboarding is far less disruptive of
		  thoughts about form and content than when my fingers would distract me with
		  complaints.</P> 
		<H3>Objective Basis</H3> 
		<P>Is there an objective basis for this relief? I believe so. Literature
		  by advocates of Dvorak claims that the QWERTY keyboard provides for merely 300
		  words using only the letters on the home row while Dvorak provides for 3,000. A
		  simple estimate of the difference in finger-reaching between the keyboards can
		  be adduced from the following table which compares the two keyboards for the
		  dozen most common English words according to <I>The Guinness Book of World
		  Records</I>. For each word, I score 1 for a reach to a non-home row and
		  &frac12; for an index finger reach for the center keys (G &amp; H for QWERTY, I
		  &amp; D for Dvorak).</P>

		<P>Roughly, one's fingers &#147;walk&#148; three times as far on QWERTY
		  as on Dvorak. And that measure does not take into account other features of the
		  Dvorak keyboard such as its propensity to alternate hands since all the vowels
		  are on the left side of the home row and there is a tendency in English for
		  vowels and consonants to alternate within words.</P> 
		<P>Why hasn't the Dvorak keyboard been adopted more widely? There are
		  issues of economics and industrial health that transcend personal preferences
		  and the explanation of &#147;inertia.&#148; &#147;Repetitive motion
		  injury&#148; has been in the public's awareness since shortly after the
		  computer has brought the keyboard out of the domain of the &#147;lowly&#148;
		  typist or secretary and put keying activities into many more places, including
		  the home, than had been previously. New mechanical configurations of keyboards
		  have been proposed that are better adapted to human anatomy. The problem of
		  injury has been addressed by reducing repetition administratively with
		  mandatory rest periods. It is not yet clear, but perhaps the reduction of
		  motion, which the Dvorak keyboard certainly does, may also contribute to the
		  reduction of injury. Cumulatively, the effect of even small improvements in
		  health and efficiency can make major contributions to general welfare.</P> 
		<P>To return to the anecdotal, my daughter has just entered junior high
		  school and is enrolled in a quarter's course in computer keyboarding, replacing
		  the traditional typing class for youngsters. She is about the age I was when I
		  first learned about August Dvorak and his then-ten-year-old keyboard, yet
		  because of &#147;inertia,&#148; she will still be using QWERTY. My daughter has
		  enough other issues to deal with at school to persuade me to refrain from
		  teaching her Dvorak at home, which would have forced her to take issue with her
		  teacher and the school's curriculum. Keyboard configuration, evidently, is
		  intimately bound to self-perpetuating social convention, and the problem of
		  inertia, which has cost us dearly in lost opportunities for ameliorating
		  physical and economic harms, must be solved socially.<A NAME="action"></A></P> 
		<H3>What to Do</H3> 
		<P>With all this in mind, I recommend the following simple action
		  program. First, as a national standard, all computer keyboard manufacturers
		  should be required to enhance their keycaps with a second set of symbols in the
		  Dvorak configuration. As a concession to the majority of current users, the
		  QWERTY set could be more prominent (larger, brighter), but the mere visual
		  presence of an alternative configuration would be sufficient to make the using
		  public aware of the Dvorak option. Second, as a related standard, all personal
		  computing operating systems should be required to have a program to re-map the
		  keyboard into either the QWERTY or Dvorak configuration. Since most already
		  have this option, the cost will be negligible. Third, the various education
		  agencies responsible for keyboard training should upgrade their software to
		  handle either QWERTY or Dvorak and remind teachers to offer the choice to the
		  students. Since keyboard operation is a rote skill, now taught by software
		  rather than by humans, there is no need to retrain teachers in the Dvorak
		  keyboard. No other mandates are required; the market, once freed from the
		  rigidity of historical accident, will decide between the configurations.</P> 
		<P>Finally, I would like to think of this minimal-mandate (at critical
		  points only), maximal-choice approach to promoting social change as a paradigm
		  for procuring other, more complex improvements in our society.</P>

		<P>Al Christie, a keyboarding instructor from British Columbia, has
		  kindly provided the following comments on switching oneself from QWERTY to
		  Dvorak without using training programs.</P> 
		<BLOCKQUOTE> 
		  <P>....As a keyboarding teacher since 1965, I have been interested in
			 quick input devices. This led me to Dvorak. About 15 to 20 years ago, I had the
			 school-board technician modify an IBM Selectric typewriter for me. I used a
			 technique which I often use with my students to teach myself to touch type on
			 this machine. It is a very simple technique which I read about in a British
			 Columbia Business Educators' journal. </P> 
		  <P>I made a paper copy of the layout and hung it in front of me. Then I
			 practised the alphabet, breaking it into groups of 3, 4. or 5 letters. (Saying
			 the old alphabet rhyme gives the natural breaks). After doing each group until
			 I could do it by touch, I went to the next group. When I got to the end of the
			 alphabet, I had forgotten the first group. Therefore, the next time through the
			 alphabet, I combined the first two groups (eg. abcdefg) and repeated each until
			 I could do it without looking. After completing the alphabet this way, I did
			 the entire alphabet by touch repeatedly until I could do it without looking.
			 This entire process took about an hour (some students take less, some more).
			 Finally, I reinforced by having students do alphabetic sentences (ones which
			 contain all the letters of the alphabet), many times.</P> 
		  <P> One doesn't have to purchase Mavis Beacon, or Typing Tutor - a
			 simple text editor is all that is needed.</P> 
		  <P> As an interesting aside, my daughter, who learned on QWERTY at
			 school, uses my Dvorak machine at home quite fluently. I had moved the keycaps
			 to the Dvorak configuration (something you didn't mention as a possibility in
			 your article). She is bi-keyboardal as well as bilingual. I haven't pushed the
			 Dvorak keyboard in my line of work. I show my students, tell them that most
			 keyboards are QWERTY, and that Dvorak would put them in a minority. Then, I let
			 them choose. For most, it's too big a mental jump to switch, so they stay with
			 QWERTY. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
