Jim Corrigan began his career as the Spectre in the early 1940s, when the hard-boiled police detective was murdered.  Put into cement and thrown into the water by crime-boss Gat Benson, Jim Corrigan's soul left his body and went on to the afterlife.  Instead of going into Heaven, his spirit refused to pass into the afterlife, and his rage was heard by the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("40499",this,"archangel.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("40499")' href="/topics/Archangel">archangel</a><span class="hp" id="m40499"><div class="hpHeader">Archangel</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i40499"></div>An archangel  is an angel of high rank.

He was condemned to return to Earth for sixty years of punishing wrongdoings.<br />
<br />
As the Spectre, Jim Corrigan returned to the mortal plane as a partial human, where he proceeded to rain his vengeance on Gat Benson and his accomplices.  In the process however, his fiancée, Clarice Winston, was mortally wounded.  Using his newfound power, he was able to return Clarice to life, but later ended their relationship in order to spare her any further pain.  He also broke off with his partner, and became more of a lone agent, trying to distance himself from his mortal ties, although he retained his job on the police force.<br />
<br />
As the popularity of superhero comics began to decline in the mid-1940s, the Spectre suffered as a result.  He was reduced to playing the role of "guardian angel" to a bumbling character called "Percival Popp, the Super Cop." Introduced in #74, December 1941 (aside from a head-shot in a one-panel preview at the end of #73's Spectre story), he was a would-be civilian sleuth who, in his words, latched onto Corrigan "of all the detectives on the force because it appeared to me that you are the most intelligent of the lot! You and I ought to be an unbeatable combination, sir!" In the following story, the Voice allowed the physical body of Jim Corrigan, still in cement at the bottom of the river, to be resurrected with the Ring of Life, which had helped the Spectre out of some jams in a few previous stories. The Ghostly Guardian found that he could emerge from Corrigan and maintain a separate existence.  In <i>More Fun</i> #90, April 1943, Jim Corrigan <i>per se</i> was completely removed from the feature &mdash; he enlisted in the military for World War II service &mdash; and the Spectre's reduction to guardian angel status was complete; he even became invisible to everybody but Percy.<br />
<br />
As the Spectre, Jim Corrigan ran with the JSA, but he was replaced in 1944, and afterwards Jim Corrigan and the Spectre disappeared from the DC Universe for more than twenty years.<br />

While the Ghostly Guardian would be crossing from one mystical plane of existence to another fighting occult menaces, Corrigan, now a captain of Gateway City's police force, was fighting his own battles against a more mundane criminal element. Jim would often get involved in Spectre's conflicts, however. In that first story, another spirit, named Azmodus, took possession of a small-time criminal, and while the two astral beings engaged in cosmic combat, the two mortal men slugged it out. In <i>Showcase</i> #64, September–October 1966, when the Spectre took possession of the body of a dying man, Ace Chance, to preserve its spark of life after his soul had departed, that spirit found the living but soulless Corrigan and entered him. With Chance's physical form hospitalized and on life-support, the Spectre found he could not re-enter Jim. Ace had no desire to give up this body, and began romancing heiress Mona Marcy. After Chance was put back into his proper body, Corrigan wondered what he was going to do about Mona, who had no idea who she had really been dating. In fact, a year later the Spectre was awarded his own comic, and in #2, January–February 1968, Jim asks his astral alter ego for a little privacy, as he has a date with Mona. While she wouldn't be mentioned again, things would become more involved for Corrigan. This series would establish that prolonged separation from his corporeal body would deplenish the Spectre's energies, and more than once, Jim's will power would be able to keep his spirit form from entering him. The latter instance found Corrigan pinned down by criminals he was after, and his demands for Spectral help result in the tired spirit acting harshly and hurting an innocent man in the vicinity. Shortly after this, the Spectre was chained to The Journal of Judgment, and Jim made no more appearances in this era.<br />

Unfortunately, he was a con artist that the department, and Jim in particular, were investigating, and he took advantage of what he presumed was the woman's mental illness to trap and kill Corrigan. As he was already dead, the plan backfired horribly. Not long later, a reporter named Earl Crawford noticed the number of gruesome finishes that many local criminals had been meeting recently, and suspected a connection. By lying to his editor as to just what he had in mind, he arranged an assignment to ride around with a police criminal investigator, and of all people, Lt. Jim Corrigan was the lucky cop. Crawford soon saw the Spectre in action for himself. Despite being a ghost, Corrigan returned Gwen's feelings and pled into the night in his dark apartment for a reprieve. Without telling him, the Voice granted the request, and he awoke the next morning a mortal man. Corrigan did not realize this until he was shot in the line of duty a few hours later. Once out of the hospital, he proposed to Gwen who promptly accepted. However, Corrigan was again murdered by criminals, and again sent back to Earth as the Spectre.

Finally, the Spectre, in <i>Last Days of the Justice Society of America</i>, failed to resolve the situation and is punished by God for his failure.

<br />
This was largely notable because now, Jim Corrigan and the Spectre became two separate entities (although the body of Jim Corrigan was in fact a piece of the Spectre's ectoplasm as later revealed).  The body of Corrigan still served as a host to the Spectre, but the Spectre could move on his own separately for a whole day, afterwards needing to return to Corrigan's body to replenish his energy.  This allowed for Corrigan to actually team up with the Spectre (rather than the two being one), in essence splitting the 'workload' in two, since one could handle research and the other could get the job done.  It also allowed for Corrigan to become a full-fledged detective again.<br />

Jim Corrigan's status quo was changed when John Ostrander landed the job as writer to a new Spectre ongoing series.  Jim Corrigan and the Spectre were now one once more, and he had moved out of his agency.  Throughout Ostrander's tenure, Jim Corrigan started to come into conflict with the Spectre as he started to grow as a person.  He learned that his old methods no longer applied to the world he lived in, and he was forced to make certain concessions.<br />
<br />
Corrigan's transformation begins in the first few issues of the new volume. Corrigan meets Amy Beitermann, a social staff worker and Inspector Nate Kane, a friend of Amy. While investigating the old murder of a woman, Corrigan learns that although he is able to solve her murder, he is unable to understand the victim, whose ghost continues to wander the scene of her death. When Corrigan exchanges memories with Amy, she learns of his true purpose: "To confront <b>and to comprehend</b> evil", an element newly introduced by Ostrander. Amy serves as Corrigan's spiritual guide from then, until she is murdered by a serial killer in issue #12.<br />

After Corrigan's confession, Craemer gives his advice, mentioning Vlatava, a country torn by civil war.<br />

<H5>#27-36</H5><br />
Azmodus eventually returns and restores Clarissa Winston's (now trapped in her grandmother's body) youth. This body is still connected to the Spectre, and thereby Azmodus can tap into the Spectre's power. The Spectre confronts Azmodus, but is captured as he is shocked to learn that Azmodus is in part, a previous host of the Spectre. His friends, most notably again Father Craemer and the reluctant Nate Kane, are able to free him and beat Azmodus, separating Caraka, previous host to the Spectre from the demon he was bonded with. In order to defeat Azmodus however, the Spectre required to cut his lifeline to Clarice's body, he decides to switch again with her repentant granddaughter. As Clarice goes to Heaven, it is revealed that she was in fact, Caraka's soulmate all along, and was attracted to Jim because of their similarities. After this ordeal, Jim Corrigan continues to serve as the Spectre, now once more a step closer to his redemption, with Craemer as his advisor.<br />

In order to find his connection to humanity again, Jim Corrigan gets himself assigned as Nate Kane's partner, the two becoming a police duo.

<br />
During the course of the search for the talisman, Jim also come to new insights as he not only meets the spirit of his old childhood friend Lonetree, but is also confronted with the fact that he was a man of the 1930s.

Intrigued, Nate Kane investigates further, and comes upon facts that indicated that Jim Corrigan might have been a murderer before his involvement with the Spectre. Meanwhile, the Spectre grows more savage, among other things killing all of the guilty on death row in a New York jail. Craemer continues to try and guide him. Corrigan also learns of what Nate is doing and the two part ways. To atone for his murdering of the criminals in the New York jail, Corrigan helps to prove the innocence of the one man he did not kill, but loses control once more, killing a bunch of corrupt police officers.

The Spectre continues his merciless way, dispensing justice on every guilty person that he comes across. He also finally meets Nate Kane, and meets the woman he previously thought he had murdered. Trying to come to grips with his own sins as well as hers (she had killed her mother and tried to frame Corrigan for it), the woman's granddaughter mercy killed her grandmother in fear of what the Spectre would do.

To their surprise, God has gone missing, as has Heaven. The two decide to work together and they visit various pantheons, as well as entering the Source Wall. Given only two cryptic messages, the Spectre demands to confront God. He is bombarded with the nature of God and becomes one with every particle in the universe. The experience again conflicts the Spectre and Corrigan, and pushed to the brink, they are ejected from the Source Wall. They then learn that the gap between the two has grown so wide that they can separate themselves. At the advice of Father Craemer, the two travel inside themselves and are eventually confronted by a seemingly crazy God who resembles Corrigan's father.<br />

God assumed the form of Corrigan's father, a travelling preacher, because he was the most influential person during Jim Corrigan's youth. Jim's father tried to imprint his black and white view of good and evil on the young boy (usually through both verbal and physical abuse), even though he himself often gave into sin. Eventually the ruse is uncovered and it turns out that Jim has finally undergone his final test and is ready to leave the mantle of the Spectre.<br />
<br />
With the help of the Spectre, Jim Corrigan's old (dead) body is given a proper burial, and his funeral is attended by many heroes and friends. Then Jim Corrigan relinquishes the Spectre, and as Father Craemer bids his last respects to his friend, from the heavens, a message is carved upon the formerly blank gravestone of Jim Corrigan, stating: "James Corrigan, servant of God".<br />

<br />
Allen, who loathed the fact that Corrigan had gotten off due to Montoya's desire to protect him, had begun investigating Corrigan.  Just as his investigation began to bear fruit however, Corrigan shot and killed Detective Allen.<br />
<br />
This spurred the GCPD to arrest Corrigan, but unfortunately the past incident with Montoya along with a decent alibi had given Corrigan the defense he needed to avoid court and jail.<br />
<br />
Montoya, who was blind with fury and had been slowly falling into a deep depression over the past few months, had finally snapped with the loss of Allen.  She stormed into Corrigan's apartment and after knocking out his girlfriend, threatened to kill Corrigan.  The previously smug CSI officer broke down and tearfully began pleading for Montoya to spare his life.  Despite her thirst for vengeance, Montoya let him go and then resigned from the force.<br />
<br />
In the final issue of the three-issue miniseries <i>Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre</i>, a miniseries about Crispus Allen dealing with his new role as the Spectre, it was revealed that Corrigan had spent the time after Montoya's attack, drinking (Allen found him in this way but did not take vengeance &mdash; too easy and too personal), but one night upon stumbling into an alley he was confronted by Allen's young son Mal and shot multiple times, killing him. Later stories instead identify Corrigan's killer as Mal's brother, Jacob Allen.<br />
<br />
The connection between this Jim Corrigan and the Jim Corrigan who had in the past been a host for the Spectre is uncertain. There is a significant physical resemblance, the Spectre had a cameo in <i>Gotham Central</i> #37, and the cover of the following issue features Corrigan prominently and bears a title including the word "Spectre," rendered in a style similar to the logo of the Moench-scripted Spectre comic series.<br />

However, as the Spectre, he required an additional human guide in the form of Norman McCay so that he could rightfully judge the actions of the humans and meta-humans.  In the end, the Spectre's intervention was not necessary, and he was later shown grousing over "The Spectre platter" (spinach and cottage cheese) while eating with McCay in the superhero-themed restaurant Planet Krypton.<br />
