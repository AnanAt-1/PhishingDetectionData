<p>NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwire - September 8, 2010) - &nbsp;BNP Paribas Corporate &amp; Investment Banking (BNP Paribas CIB) announces the reorganization of its Global Equities and Commodity Derivatives (GECD) business as a proactive measure towards achieving one of BNP Paribas CIB's strategic objectives: becoming a key player in the Equities and Commodity Derivatives world.</p>
        <p>The objective of the reorganization is to increase the efficiency of the business in order to further improve the way we serve our clients both globally and locally. Yann G&#233;rardin, Global Head of GECD, and Olivier Osty, his Deputy, are therefore pleased to announce the following changes:</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to the organization</strong></p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>More autonomy is given to the GECD Regions in&nbsp;line with BNP Paribas CIB's regionalisation. Edward Speal, newly&nbsp;appointed, heads the Americas Region and Pierre Rousseau heads the Asia&nbsp;Pacific Region. Yann G&#233;rardin and Olivier Osty will manage the European&nbsp;Region. </li>
            <li>The activity is organised around four newly&nbsp;formed businesses: Commodity Derivatives, managed by Amine Bel Hadj&nbsp;Soulami, Market Liquidity Provider headed by Olivier Osty, Structured&nbsp;Equity managed by Nicolas Marque, newly appointed and Flow &amp; Financing&nbsp;under Emmanuel Heurtier, again newly appointed. </li>
            <li>New positions are created to enhance the sharing&nbsp;of know-how whilst maintaining the highest standards in terms of risk&nbsp;management and business ethics : Jacques Vigner is appointed Global Chief&nbsp;Operating Officer / Strategy &amp; Risk, Val&#233;rie Rabault is appointed Head&nbsp;of Market Prospective &amp; Business Risk and Constance Chalchat is&nbsp;appointed Head of Communication &amp; People Development. </li>
            <li>With the objective of better addressing specific&nbsp;regional and local needs, an entity dedicated to emerging markets is&nbsp;created. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Enlarged Executive Committee<br />
        </strong>The GECD Executive Committee is enlarged to welcome the following newly appointed members in addition to Yann G&#233;rardin, Olivier Osty, Amine Bel Hadj Soulami, Pierre Rousseau, Lionel Crassier, Eric Le Brusq and Jacques Vigner : Edward Speal, Emmanuel Heurtier, Nicolas Marque, Val&#233;rie Rabault and Constance Chalchat.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the new organization, Yann G&#233;rardin said: "As leaders in our industry we need to continuously adapt to meet the needs of our clients in different types of markets and stay one step ahead of the competition. This reorganization reaffirms GECD's strong commitment to our clients in all regions combined with our strong risk management and ethical approach to business. I strongly believe these to be key differentiating points, enabling BNP Paribas to excel and pave the way for the future of the derivatives industry."</p>
        <p><strong>Appendix :</strong> <strong>biographies</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>Yann G&#233;rardin</strong></em> <em>joined BNP in 1987 to create the equity derivatives business, being appointed global head of equity derivatives for the newly created BNP Paribas in 1999.&nbsp;At the beginning of 2005, Yann took over the responsibility of the entire BNP Paribas Equities &amp; Derivatives division, to which the Commodity Derivatives activity was added later that year. Today, Yann leads a global powerhouse in the field of equity and commodity derivatives, employing more than 1500 people in Front Office and the different support functions across 5 Regions.</em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Olivier Osty</strong></em> <em>joined BNP's Equities platform in Tokyo in 1991, before moving to Paris four years later to assume responsibility for the Options Trading business in Europe. Having been instrumental in positioning BNP Paribas as a global leader in this business, Olivier was promoted Global Head of Trading, research and structuring in 2004. In 2008 Olivier was given the responsibility of overseeing the running of the Commodity Derivatives business of the new GECD having previously been appointed deputy head of the Equity Derivatives business.</em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Amine Bel Hadj Soulami</strong></em> <em>joined Paribas in 1987 in the Organisation and Information Technology Department, subsequently holding various positions in Capital Markets activities. He started the first precious metals derivatives trading activities in 1991 in Paris, before setting up the energy options trading activities (oil and US natural gas) in Paris and New York. Amine has since managed the Equity Derivatives business in Tokyo, Europe and the Americas before returning to his roots in 2006, being appointed Global Head of Commodity Derivatives.</em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Pierre Rousseau</strong></em> <em>joined BNP Paribas in 2005 and was appointed Head of GECD Asia Pacific Region in 2009. This includes leading both the cash equities and the derivatives businesses in the region. Pierre had previously held the position of global head of equity brokerage. Prior to Pierre's career with BNP Paribas, he headed up Credit Agricole's equities business in Asia and Japan, where he oversaw rebuilding of the equity activity business under the management of Credit Agricole Cheuvreux (a business that was sold to BNP Paribas in August 2005).</em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Lionel Crassier</strong></em> <em>has been with BNP Paribas for 16 years, starting his career as an Equity Derivatives Options Trader in the Tokyo office before being appointed Global Head of the Exotic Trading Team in 1998 and the Global Chief Operating Officer of the Trading &amp; Structuring team in 2005.&nbsp;Prior to his move to New York, Lionel was Deputy Global Head of Trading &amp; Structuring and Global Head of the Structuring Group from April 2006 to June 2007.
