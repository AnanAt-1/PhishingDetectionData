<br />
The story that Arquette later told about his big break was that one night in the late 1950s he was watching <i><a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("49466",this,"the_tonight_show.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("49466")' href="/topics/The_Tonight_Show">The Tonight Show</a><span class="hp" id="m49466"><div class="hpHeader">The Tonight Show</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i49466"></div>The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show that has aired on NBC since 1954.

<H2>Charley Weaver</H2>
In 1959, Arquette accepted Paar's invitation to perform on Paar's <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("48209",this,"nbc.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("48209")' href="/topics/NBC">NBC</a><span class="hp" id="m48209"><div class="hpHeader">NBC</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i48209"></div>The National Broadcasting Company  is an American commercial broadcasting television network and former radio network headquartered in the GE Building in New York City's Rockefeller Center with additional major offices near Los Angeles and in Chicago...</div><br></span>&nbsp;<i>Tonight Show.</i>  Arquette depicted the character of "Charley Weaver, the wild old man from Mount Idy." He would bring along, and read, a letter from his "Mamma" back home. This characterization proved so popular that Arquette almost never again appeared in public as himself, but nearly always as Charley Weaver, complete with his squashed hat, little round glasses, rumpled shirt, broad tie, baggy pants, and suspenders.<br />
<br />
Although a good number of Arquette's jokes appear 'dated' now (and, arguably, even back then), he could still often convulse Paar and the audience into helpless laughter by way of his timing and use of double entendres in describing the misadventures of his fictional family and townspeople.  As Paar noted, in his foreword to Arquette's first Charley Weaver book:<br />
<br />
"Sometimes his jokes are old, and I live in the constant fear that the audience will beat him to the punch line, but they never have.  And I suspect that if they ever do, he will rewrite the ending on the spot.  I would not like to say that all his jokes are old, although some have been found carved in stone.  What I want to say is that in a free-for-all ad lib session, Charley Weaver has and will beat the fastest gun alive."<br />

<H2>"Letters from Mamma"</H2>
The usual pattern of the Letters was:<br />

<ul>
<li> A strange-name greeting from "Mamma," with Weaver explaining that it related to what "Mamma always wanted me to be." Example: "Dear Peyton. (Mamma always wanted me to have my own place.)"</li>
<li> The statement, "'Things are fine in Mount Idy.' (She goes on) ...."</li>
<li> The news of "Weaver's" family and townspeople back in the fictional town of Mount Idy.
