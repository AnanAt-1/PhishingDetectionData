      <P align="left"><FONT color="#FFFFFF" face="Courier New" size="-1">The name Lacombe has a geographic origin and is widely spread in the southwest of France, particularly in Pï¿½rigord. The terrain of these regions shows many "combes," a word that means deep valley. The word "combe" is from Gaulish origin. We all know that Gaulish people have fought Roman invasions led by Julius Caesar about 2000 years ago. Perhaps we are the descendants of these peoples but this remains to be seen. There are numerous ways to write Lacombe as shown in the first newspaper of La Voix des Lacombe of June 87, page 4.
<br>
      <br>
      Most of the Lacombes living in Canada and in the United States are descendants of French settlers who arrived in New-France in the late 1600's.<br>
      <B>So, I must wonder if I am a descendant of one of the first 4 French settlers mentioned below: 
<br>
      <br>
      Pierre Balan-Lacombe, from Cantillac, France</b><br>
      Pierre Balan-Lacombe is the ancestor of the largest family using this name in Quebec. Born in France around 1646, son of Pierre and Perinne Courrier, he departed from a village called Cantillac. He came to Canada with the Carignan regiment as a soldier. After he finished serving with this regiment, he chose to settle in Canada. He married Renï¿½e Birette (daughter of Jean Birette and Simone Perinne) at Notre Dame in Quebec City on June 9, 1672. Pierre obtained lands on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River in the region of St-Michel de Bellechasse. There, they raised their numerous children. Pierre Balan-Lacombe died at 44 around the year 1688. Renee Birette, then widow, married Jean Brias-Latreille. She died around the year 1715. Today's descendants of Pierre Balan-Lacombe are located in most parts of Quebec, and also in Ontario and in the United States (mainly in New England). A more comprehensive work on Pierre Balan-Lacombe is available from the l'Association des Lacombe, Inc.
<br>
      <br>
      <B>Jean Lacombe</b><br>
      Jean LaCombe is the ancestor of the second largest Lacombe family in Quebec. Born in France around 1648, son of Etienne Lacombe and Marguerite Leroux, he departed from a tiny village named St-Cybranet near Sarlat in Perigord (in the southwest of France). Upon his arrival in Quebec around 1673, he obtained land at Chambly but only remained there for a short period. He came to Montreal in 1677 and married Marie-Charlotte Millet at Notre Dame church on June 20, 1678. Then they moved to Pointe-aux-Trembles near the East End side of Montreal Island. Their 12 children were born and married there. Jean Lacombe died at 84 on September 17, 1732. His wife followed him to the grave in 1751. Today's descendants are mostly located in the Montreal region and in western Quebec and Ontario. 
<br>
      <br>
      <B>Jean and Jean-Baptiste Truillier-Lacombe</b><br>
      Jean-Baptiste Truillier-Lacombe arrived in Canada with his brother Jean around the year 1690. Both came from a town near Puymirol near Agen in the southwest of France. Their dates of birth are unknown. They were the sons of Jacques and Marguerite Passeleigne. We know very little about them. Jean married Elizabeth Delguel et Notre Dame church in Montreal on February 12, 1694 but had no male descendants. His brother Jean-Baptiste married Marie-Anne Brosseau around the year 1707 (the location of the marriage remains unknown). Four boys were born to this marriage. Later, three of them settled in Montreal while the other one settled in Trois-Riviï¿½res. Today's descendants of Jean-Baptiste Truillier-Lacombe are mostly located in the extreme southwest of Quebec and in Ontario (Prescott, Russell, and Glengarry counties). 
<br>
      <br>
      Today, 70 percent of all the Lacombes are the descendants of Pierre, while the remaining 30 percent are shared equally between the others.<br>
