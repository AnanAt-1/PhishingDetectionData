Abel agrees, and befriends Kua-ko, who tells him of the "Bird Woman", who killed his older brother, and that their tribe is not allowed in the nearby forest.<br />
<br />
Abel ignores the warning and ventures into the forest, where he sees a young woman (<a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("1429",this,"audrey_hepburn.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("1429")' href="/topics/Audrey_Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a><span class="hp" id="m1429"><div class="hpHeader">Audrey Hepburn</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i1429"></div>Audrey Hepburn  was a British  actress and humanitarian.

He returns to the Indians, and Kua-ko tells him that Runi wishes Abel to use his gun and kill the girl. He returns to the forest, but decides to warn the girl instead.

The girl takes Abel to her home and tends his wound. Upon waking up, he meets the girl's grandfather, Nuflo (Lee J Cobb), who tells him her name is Rima.<br />
<br />
The next day, with his leg wounded by the snake, Abel meets Rima again and they begin to talk. Rima takes a liking to him, but Nuflo warns her that he will leave once his leg heals. Abel is soon able to walk without a cane, and Rima therefore begins showing him the forest. Abel tells her that he has come to like her as well, and Rima is confused. She goes to speak with her dead mother's spirit, and decides to return to where she came from to ask a village elder about her strange new feelings for Abel. Later, Abel and Rima travel to the edge of the forest, where he shows her Riolama, which she remembers as her village. Despite Nuflo's initial reluctance to take her, Rima forces him to show her the way by threatening his soul if he does not.<br />
<br />
Abel decides it is time for him to return to the Indians. He tells Runi of how Rima saved him, but neither he nor Kua-ko believe him. He quickly realizes that Kua-ko killed his brother and placed the blame on Rima, but is tied up. After a bravery test (withstanding bee and wasp stings without making a sound), Kua-ko and the Indians make ready to enter the forest and kill Rima.<br />
<br />
Abel escapes and warns Nuflo and Rima, and together they escape to Riolama, where Nuflo tells Abel that he cannot return to the village because he caused a massacre. He managed to help Rima and her mother, and promised to take care of Rima, but was ashamed at his part in the massacre. Rima overhears, and curses Nuflo. She then rushes down to Riolama, where she faints in the heat. Abel follows and takes her to safety. When she awakens, Abel tells her how he has come to love her, and Rima does also, having only come to decipher her strange feelings and now recognizing them as love for him.<br />
<br />
Rima steals away while Abel is asleep to go back to Nuflo and apologize, but when she finds him, the Indians have burnt their home and he is nearly dead. She asks his forgiveness, and with his last words Nuflo tries to warn her of the Indians. She quickly discovers for herself, and races through the forest to escape. Kua-ko burns the great tree where she has hidden. Meanwhile, Abel awakens and realizes what Rima has done. He quickly follows and finds Kua-ko, who teases that he killed her. The two fight into a stream, where Abel manages to drown Kua-ko.<br />
<br />
Abel remembers a flower Rima told him of, which, if it disappears in one place, blossoms in another close by. He finds the flower, and not far off, Rima herself, who extends her hand. He takes it, and they begin their life in the forest together.<br />

<H2>Critical reception</H2>
Although considerable effort had been made to produce a faithful and convincing rendering of the book, the film was not reviewed kindly by critics at the time and was not a commercial success.<br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
Critics were not kind to the film, impressed neither by its lush widescreen visuals nor by the equally lush musical score that accompanied them.. .</blockquote><br />
<br />
And<br />
<blockquote><br />
Screen adaptation of W. H. Hudson's novel suffers due to miscasting of Hepburn as Rima the Bird Girl . .</blockquote><br />
<br />
Rima of the novel was 4.5 feet (1.37 m) tall, 17 years of age, demure and dark-haired (although descended from a mysterious group of fair-skinned people), and had lived her life entirely in the deepest jungle.  Hepburn at the time of filming was 29 years old, more than a foot taller than the novel Rima, and too stunningly beautiful and smooth-skinned to ever be taken as a forest creature.<br />
