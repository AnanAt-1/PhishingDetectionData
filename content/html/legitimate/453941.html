<H3>Early years</H3>
Cropper claimed to have picked up the guitar at age 16. His mother reports that he first "rocked" to a small 45 rpm record in his bedroom where he played "Let's Go To The Hop" by Danny and the Juniors.  He was about two years old, and he loved it.  He used to spend hours, as a very young child, listening to "Tommy" by The Who.  He has never openly admitted what the first record he bought was, but his first "cool" album was Jimi Hendrix. He was a fan of various genres, like psychedelic, grunge, and punk. He was in various bands in his twenties before joining bands that contained the core members of what would become <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("28179",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("28179")' href="/topics/Weezer">Weezer</a><span class="hp" id="m28179"><div class="hpHeader">Weezer</div><div class="hpContent">Weezer is an American alternative rock band.

<H3>With Weezer</H3>
Cropper was the original guitarist for Weezer, and as such was present at the band's first official band practice on February 14, 1992.

However, in 1993, during the recording of <i>Weezer</i> (aka <i>The Blue Album</i>), Cropper left the band and was then replaced by guitarist <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("26922",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("26922")' href="/topics/Brian_Bell_(musician)">Brian Bell</a><span class="hp" id="m26922"><div class="hpHeader">Brian Bell (musician)</div><div class="hpContent">Brian Bell  is an American guitarist and songwriter.

Cropper has remained good friends with the other members of Weezer, recently known to have attended Rivers Cuomo's wedding in 2006.<br />

Jason and his then wife, Amy Wellner Cropper, formed the band Chopper One after Cropper left Weezer. The pair (along with drummer Tyrone Rio) released the single "Free Lunch" in 1995, followed by the album <i>Now Playing</i> in 1997.<br />

In Jan of 1994, their first of three children was born, a young girl they named Kiefer Rain Cropper.
