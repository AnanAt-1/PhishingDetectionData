<P><FONT SIZE="+2" class="font-italic font-center"><b>Hershey Felder leaves George Gershwin "alone" to spend time with Chopin</i></b>
</font></center>

<p><table  cellpadding="4" align="RIGHT"><tr><td align="CENTER"><img src="/sources//regional/Icons/chfelder.jpg" /><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans serif" size="-1"><b>Hershey Felder as Chopin </b><br></font></td></tr></table>On a Friday afternoon in late July, Hershey Felder is facing the final
weekend of the  nearly yearlong Chicago run of his one-man show, <i>George
Gershwin Alone</i>.  For this show, which he wrote, he has been performing
as actor, singer and concert pianist; in one venue or another, one country
or another; for the past six years.  Though on this afternoon he has four
performances remaining as Gershwin, he's already begun the transformation
into his next role, that of the early 19th-century composer Frédéric
Chopin, by letting his hair grown to a length suitable for the time ("it's
getting harder and harder to pull it back to look like Gershwin," he
confides).  The emotional transformation has begun as well, as is evident
from the reading of the new show, called <i>Monsieur Chopin</i>, for which
Felder has invited me to sit in. The show will begin previews at the Royal
George Theater,  <i>Gershwin</i>'s Chicago home, on August 30th.  A long
life on the road is expected for it as well. After the reading, we
retreated to a Halsted Street restaurant just up the block from the Royal
George.  He's quick to assure me that it was not initially a given that
<i>Monsieur Chopin</i> would be a one-man show like <i>Gershwin</i>.

<p>"I did a preliminary workshop where I used three people" (to play the
characters of Chopin, his female lover novelist George Sand, and Chopin's
friend, the painter Eugène Delacroix). "It was quite clear that
fundamentally the concept was wrong.  And I did it with Tony Crivello.  We
did it for a couple of weeks in Boston a few years ago and it was very
clear that we were working with a huge problem which is that Chopin in
that situation can't talk because he's angry at everybody all the time. 
He can't say anything, so he's constantly running to the piano.  And the
fact is that the audience wants to know what he has to say.  And they want
to hear him play.  So, this is not for lack of trying, or for wanting to
do another one-man show.  You try all kinds of things and eventually you
realize you have to give the audience what they're prepared to come and
see.  And then you figure out artistically what to do."

<p>Though the reading I'd just seen lacked the benefit of lighting or the
extensive use of projections and film Felder tells me will be an integral
part of the show, the differences in subject matter between Gershwin and
Chopin were clear.  While Gershwin was rather guarded and private, and had
disappointments both professional and personal, he seems to have enjoyed a
generally happy and successful, albeit tragically short life (he died at
age 38). Chopin, who died at age 39, suffered from what was then called
melancholy but is now known as bipolar disease, Hershey explains, and
lived much of his life in extreme emotional isolation from others.

<p>"In the case of Gershwin, it was a way to communicate a man who wanted
the world and died before he had a chance.  In the case of Chopin, it's a
very different kettle of fish; this is a man who had the world, and he
didn't have himself.  It's sad to think he's so gifted and so magical,
such a wizard and yet could be so ill at ease in a conversation, in a
relationship. Sand first fell in love with him because he was this
magical, prince-like wizard and then she had to get out of the
relationship because he basically drove her mad. A person knows what it's
like to be with somebody who doesn't see the world, not necessarily the
way you do, but doesn't see the world in some form of reality.  Ghosts and
conflict and haunting, which is what his problem was.  So there's a story
to tell here, and yet he produces some of the most beautiful music ever
written.  Absolute, absolute beauty!  How is this possible? Where does
this come from? Did emotional things drive him?  So that's part of the
study of this character and I think people relate to it in some way or
other."

<p>The show reveals how Chopin, either due to circumstances or to his
melancholia and anxiety, was unable to sustain the close relationships he
so greatly desired. He has difficulty communicating through language and
instead seems to turn to composition as his means of sharing his feelings.
"This is a far more inner, romantic  ...   He also has a much more huge range
of emotions than Gershwin.  There's a lot to do for the actor. There's
<i>something</i> to do. With Gershwin, you push the 'go button' and that's
all.  Gershwin hides his emotions. Gershwin is telling a story and saying
at the end of the story 'I want you to love me and remember me.'   He
said, 'we wanted to be famous.'  Why were two guys from Brooklyn or
Manhattan writing about Swanee?  Chopin didn't want to be famous.  He
didn't care."

<p>I ask how an artist like Chopin made his living then, if not through
the fame of public performance. "He was a piano teacher," Hershey
explains. "In his whole life he gave only 30 concerts.  He didn't like it.
 Hated it. Hated playing concerts, hated being with people in public."

<p>"Is it a bit more enjoyable for you given your training as a concert
pianist to do Chopin than it was Gershwin?" He answers, "Well, there are
several things. In <i>Chopin</i>, it's all about the music and nothing else.  In
<i>Gershwin</i>, it's about the performer. In Chopin, I get to just sit at the
piano.  And while there are emotional things going on, I get to sit at the
piano and focus."

<p>I tell Hershey that it seems in <i>Monsieur Chopin</i>, there are more
minutes given to the music than to the monologue, compared to the Gershwin
show. He replies, "It feels that way because of the way it's set up.  I
think one feels the continuation of the story through the playing.  I'll
be very interested to see what my <i>Gershwin</i> public thinks of this.  They're
coming. They're already buying tickets in a major way.  It'll be
interesting to see how they react because it's so different.  I've been
doing bits and pieces from it during the encores (of <i>George Gershwin
Alone</i>), ten-minute sections, and the whole attitude of the audience
shifts. They're laughing, I love how much they laugh, because there are
lots of funny lines in it.  Not funny the way Gershwin is funny, but
Chopin did such strange things, some times I'll pull out the handkerchief
and they start laughing."

<p>We wonder how the audience developed through a year's run of <i>George
Gershwin Alone</i> will cross over into it. Hershey theorizes, "I think
today a lot of people want to be 'allowed in' to the music world.  In the
old days, you didn't have records. Someone in the house played piano. That
was how you made music. <i>People</i> made music. <i>Everybody</i>
played.  It was really a remarkable time. A couple hundred years ago for
sure, everybody studied music, had music books.  Think about what a time
that must have been."

<p>Though the Gershwin songbook Felder has been performing for six years
is hardly new, it's more familiar to the audiences than much of the Chopin
that will be performed in the new show, the phrases borrowed by Barry
Manilow for "Could It Be Magic?" notwithstanding.  Will audiences
unschooled in the classics relate as well to Chopin? Hershey answers, 
"It's more fun if you know what's going on, that much I can guarantee you.
You have a visceral, emotional and physical reaction to the whole thing. 
What's sort of exciting about this is that it makes that what would
ordinarily seem inaccessible accessible.  There's nothing weird or you
can't understand it, it's not so artsy-fartsy that you can't understand
what's going on and the regular public will understand it on an emotional
level."

<p>Is he prepared to play Chopin as long as he played Gershwin? Felder admits to some concern about the emotional demands of the
piece. "Chopin is sadder. The music is much more beautiful but
it rips me apart every day.  There are two types of actors.  There are
actors that manufacture emotions and actors that just allow emotion. With
Gershwin I have to manufacture it because he's a non-emotional man playing
a non-emotional piece.  With Chopin I get to be the other actor and just
to allow it to happen.  The secret of Chopin is allowing it complete
freedom and if you allow it complete freedom it explodes. Somehow it just
comes and you get to the end and tears are just rolling down my face, and
I'm going 'this poor man.'"

<p>He describes a moment late in the piece after
Sand has left Chopin, but returns briefly for one last time. "The moment
that just breaks my heart is when he meets her downstairs and he asks 'do
you still love me?' and he walks toward her and he waits for her
answer ... and I'm thinking ... that moment must have been ... (Hershey seems
uncharacteristically lost for words) ...  because it happened. Two weeks ago I
was in Paris and I stood on the place where it happened and you think ... I'm
so, so, so, so sad.  All he wanted is for her to say she did (love him)
and she couldn't even give him that.  He probably was so difficult that
had she given that, she would have broken."

<p>I ask Hershey if it was harder researching Chopin than Gershwin, since
at least a few of Gershwin's contemporaries are still alive. "Much
easier," he replies.  "You see, when you grow up in the classical world,
it's not alien.  When you're exposed to your first Chopin piece at
whatever age you want to devour everything about this man, and I did, as a
kid. (In developing <i>Monsieur Chopin</i>) I had associations with every
Chopin society; and with Jeffrey Kallberg, who's chairman of the
department of music at U. Penn. He is the number one specialist on Chopin
in America, so he acted as a consultant and we became friends.  If I
wanted to take a scene in this way, he made sure it was believable, if I
wanted to take a scene that way, that kind of thing.  Things like I would
say this or that or the other thing, he would say, 'it actually happened
exactly like this.'  It was about having a pedant.  It was important to
have a pedant. And he's totally not a pedant, but he knows how to be one
at the end of the day.  Notwithstanding my knowledge, because as a
classical musician I do have stored knowledge of that kind of stuff, but
it was integral that it be done for real. None of these stories are made
up.  All of what you see has reference."

<p>After six years of playing George Gershwin, does he have any nostalgia
at all about saying goodbye to him? I learn that he won't be leaving
Gershwin alone entirely just yet. "I've been asked to take him to large
venues all across the country and in Europe, so I'll have those
engagements on weekends, or this that and the other thing."  Felder's
performance as Gershwin will live on in recordings as well, I'm told. "On
July 1, WFMT (a classical radio station in Chicago) entered into a
relationship with me and broadcast the entire <i>Gershwin Alone</i> live
across the country." The live broadcast will be released on CD.  "They had
never had a recording album so I am in effect the very first record on the
WFMT Network's recording label. The new album is coming out in a couple of
weeks, so that will be fun too.  It will be fun because when we recorded
it at a live performance, the entire house was jam packed with people who
stood up to sing (in the post-show sing-along) and then came back and we
sang for the whole country.  We had a lot of fun ... we sang and sang and
sang. To have a full house of 400 singing, it was amazing. It's been a
wild year, here."
