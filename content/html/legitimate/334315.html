                                                Detroit Tigers organization. Willis pitched poorly &#x2013; and expensively &#x2013; for the Tigers for much of the last three seasons, but Burris saw no reason he should be finished as an effective pitcher.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Tigers designated Willis for assignment Saturday. If he is not traded or claimed off waivers in 10 days, the Tigers will release him.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Willis broke into the majors with a flourish, going 14-6 for the Florida Marlins in 2003 and being named the National League&#x2019;s rookie of the year. After the 2007 season, he was dealt to the Tigers with
                                                Miguel Cabrera in a deal that sent the highly regarded prospect Cameron Maybin and five others to Florida.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In parts of the next three seasons marred by physical problems, Willis went 2-8 with a 6.86 earned run average in 24 games.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perez has not been quite that bad for the Mets, and they are on the hook for considerably more than what&#x2019;s left of Willis&#x2019;s $12 million salary for this season. After allowing <a href="https://nytimes.stats.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=300529108&amp;final=true">three runs in two innings of relief</a>                                                Saturday, his E.R.A. is up to 6.25. This after his 6.82 mark from last year.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Mets owe Perez another $12 million for next season before his contract expires, but should they follow the Tigers&#x2019; lead and get rid of their quirky left-hander before they are contractually obligated
                                                to?

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In baseball, a heartthrob named Barry Zito was pitching in the final year of his contract with the Oakland Athletics amid trade rumors. It wasn&#x2019;t the best season of his career, but it turned out to be
                                                better than any season he would have with his next team, the San Francisco Giants.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That winter, the Giants signed Zito to a seven-year, $126 million contract, the highest of any pitcher at the time. During the three years since he signed that deal, Giants fans watched in frustration as Zito
                                                compiled a 31-43 record and a 4.56 earned run average.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But just as some were ready to give up on Zito, he is finally showing life and the form that won him a Cy Young award in 2002, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/sports/baseball/05giants.html?ref=sports">as Tyler Kepner recently detailed.<br>
</a><br> Zito is not the only player flashing signs of his old self. In less dramatic fashion, Dontrelle Willis is turning out quality starts again, and if they continue, it will be the first season he has consistently done that since 2006.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#x2019;s a stretch to say that Willis looks like the same pitcher that burst onto the scene in 2003, going to the All-Star Game and winning the National League Rookie of the Year award. But the fact that
                                                he&#x2019;s pitching to major league hitters at all is impressive enough after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/sports/baseball/14willis.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=dontrelle%20willis&amp;st=cse">the way things have gone for him</a>                                                since arriving in Detroit.</p>

                                                the majors. He is 20 years old and slugged 28 homers with 92 runs batted in between Class A and AA last season.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One thing he cannot do is cook. One thing he can do very well is eat.

I&#x2019;ve never seen
                                                anything like it.&#x201D;</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Marlins have said <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/2010/02/26/1500998/florida-marlins-wont-rush-top.html">they won&#x2019;t rush Stanton</a>, who is likely headed to Class AA again, but Maybin, who turns

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybin had shoulder surgery in the off-season, and while he said the shoulder was not back to normal, he added that the pain was &#x201C;definitely gone&#x201D;. Slowed by a groin injury this spring, he recovered
                                                to bash two homers on Saturday in Viera against the Nationals.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Barry Bonds was warming up in left field before Saturday&#x2019;s game when he stopped to listen to a special message on the center-field scoreboard. It was Wayne Gretzky, who was known as the Great One, speaking
                                                to Bonds, who is close to becoming the greatest home run hitter ever. </p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gretzky congratulated Bonds, reminded Bonds not to stop at 756 homers and said he would be rooting for Bonds as Bonds tried to &#x201C;chase down history.&#x201D; That chase will continue. Bonds failed to homer
                                                off Dontrelle Willis, but the Giants rallied for two runs in the ninth inning to edge the Florida Marlins, 4-3.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bonds went 0 for 3 with a walk off Willis, the animated left-hander with the corkscrew motion. So Bonds remained stuck at 754 homers, one short of tying Hank Aaron for the career record. Bonds has one more home
                                                game at AT&amp;T Park on Sunday before the Giants travel to Los Angeles and San Diego for six games.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For three of Bonds&#x2019;s four at-bats, Willis challenged him. Willis pumped four fastballs to Bonds in the first inning before striking him out with a 96-mile-per-hour heater. With the eager fans chanting,
                                                &#x201C;Bar-ree! Bar-ree!&#x201D; Willis threw a perfectly placed fastball on the inside corner. Bonds could not extend his arms and waved through the pitch. </p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Bonds popped out on the second pitch in the third, walked in the sixth and popped out on the first pitch with two on in the seventh. On both pop-ups, Bonds barely budged 15 feet out of the batter&#x2019;s box.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unless Bonds hits two homers Sunday, he will leave for what could be an awkward trip. He does not want to set the record away from San Francisco, so he is likely to sit out at least two of those games.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On July 19, Bonds hit two homers off the Chicago Cubs. Does anyone believe he can repeat that feat against the Marlins on Sunday, pass Aaron and complete this pursuit with a flourish? Bonds and the Giants&#x2019;
                                                fans want to believe it. Do you? </p>
