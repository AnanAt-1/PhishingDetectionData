<blockquote><i><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Those who are
able
to grow their own meat are in an enviable position. But when we come to
kill a cattle beast for our own use, it would be useful to have a
smaller
animal so most of it can fit in the freezer. And the naturally smaller
sized cuts fit in perfectly with todays smaller family size. If we are
'weekend farmers' on small holdings, we need to have easy care beasts.
Small breeds of cattle have these traits, plus fast growth and
naturally
'marbled' meat.</font></font></i>
  <br>
&nbsp;</blockquote>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">As cattle are selected for
increased
size and faster growth rate, their fertility rate drops, and the
efficiency
of conversion of grass into meat (kg meat per hectare) falls. It has
been
difficult to select for increased carcass yeild in catttle, as yeild is
governed by many interacting traits. Small beef breeds have a
reputation
for efficient pasture conversion, better fertility, with more of the
higher
value meat cuts per hectare, as 'up to' two times the number small
cattle
as against normal breeds can be carried on the same area of land.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Miniature Herefords</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">The cows are about 1.08
metres/3&frac12;
feet tall, and average weight range is 300-350 kgs. The calves have a
birth
weight of around 26 kgs/57 lbs (with a range of 24-30 kilograms), and
at
weaning the average weight is 170 kgs/375 lbs. Carcass weights can be
over
60%, and rib eye over 10%.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">The advantages of this
breed
are the smaller cuts of meat, the higher stocking rate per acre, high
feed
conversion rates (efficient converters), less damage to pasture,
especially
on wet soils, less damage to handling yards, easy calving, and
excellent
weight gains.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Lowline</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Derived from a cattle research
project started by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in
1974.
Lowline cattle have been developed soley in Australia.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">A fully grown bull is about
1.1
metres/just over 3&frac12; feet tall (at the shoulder). A mature ( 3
year
old) bull can weigh up to 450 kgs. Cows&nbsp; can weigh up to 420 kgs
at
3 years, but more typically average 320kg/705 lbs. Cows are about a
metre
high at the shoulder.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Lowlines have a carcass
yeild
of up to 81% saleable meat.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">One of the interesting traits
of the lowliner is that the meat is naturally 'marbled' even when soley
pasture fed.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Lowlines are noted for the
efficiency
of production of the prime meat part of the carcass. While Lowlines are
no more or less efficient at feed conversion or overall production than
other meat breeds such as Simmental and Angus, they produce almost
double
the eye - muscle area ( about 23 square cm/100 kg ) than Angus ( 14
square
cm/100 kg ) or Simmental ( 12 square cm/100 kg ) when measured in kg/ha.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">The hind quarters of this
breed
are well developed, which increases the proportion of prime cut meat.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Again, the higher stocking
rate
means more production per hectare. Lowlines are one of the most docile
breeds of cattle, and are easy calvers.</font></font>

<b><font face="Lucida Sans">Dexter</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Dexters are a hardy breed of
small mountain cattle, originally derived from the Celtic cattle of
ancient
Ireland. They are the smallest British breed of cattle with a cow being
from 90 cm/36 inches to just over a metre/ 42 inches at the shoulder.
An
average cow weighs about 350 kg. The coat is usually black, but it can
be red or dun brown.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">They are very hardy, requiring
no pampering, yet remain efficient converters of feed to meat. Like
most
small breeds, they require only half the space a conventional animal
would
take.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Pasture fed animals can
finished
early, at 18 to 24 months and 350kgs liveweight, without supplementary
feeds, and still have good marbling and meat flavor. Dexters have a
good
meat to bone ratio, and can kill out at around 56%. As with all small
breeds,
the bome-in joints are smaller and better suited to smaller modern
families.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Heifers are precocious, and
can
be mated at 15 to 18 months. The Dexter is noted for easy calving, and
the breed is known for the long useful breeding life of the cows - up
to
fourteen years, sometimes more.</font></font>

<b><font face="Lucida Sans">Miniature Zebu</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Miniature Zebu (Brahma cattle)
are still extremely rare (about 750 purebred animals in USA). The
advantage
of the miniature zebu is that that are better adapted to heat than most
European breeds.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">The maximum allowable height
is just over a metre/42 inches behind the typical <i>Bos indicus</i>
hump.</font></font>

<b><font face="Lucida Sans">Miniature Longhorns</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">These attractive cattle stand
just under a metre/about 40 inches at the shoulder in a mature bull.
They
are horned cattle, which after all, is one of their breed features.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Miniature Galloway</font></b>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">A breed originally from from
County Galloway, Scotland, they are remarkable for their docility, and
their 'double coat' - a heavy, hairy outer coat, and a soft downy
undercoat
(the only other bovines with a double coat are highland cattle and
bison).
The down, which is often shed in the summer, can be spun. They&nbsp;
are
both cold hardy, and tolerant to heat.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Galloways are naturally
polled
(hornless), and are hardy, and easy calving, The cows are good mothers
and have good udders and are good milk producers. It is claimed that
Galloways
will form a crescent to protect young against dogs, and that a Galloway
amongst sheep will usefully act as a protecter of the flock against dog
attack.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">The breed standard for height
is:</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Bulls 10-12 months old - 110cm
at the hip maximum height.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Females 10-12 months old -
105cm
at the hip maximum height.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Well grown calves average
between
15kg - 20kg at birth.</font></font>
<br>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Steer calves, mature later
than
a lot of larger size breeds, but have tender, flavorsome, juicy meat,
with
good color; and achieve marbling on grass. In tests in the USA, (full
size)
Galloway crossbred meat was measured as top of the breeds for flavor,
tenderness
and juiciness, supporting the long standing claim that Galloway beef is
exceptionally good .</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><font size="-1">Miniature Galloways are
non-selective
grazers, don't damage trees and fences, make relatively little impact
on
the pasture, and are therefore very well suited to the small farms.</font></font>

<b><font face="Lucida Sans">&nbsp;Red Poll</font></b>

no de-budding, and has a reputation for 'doing well' even on poor weedy
pasture.</font></font>
