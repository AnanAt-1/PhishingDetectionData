<p>There were many ways of weaving narrow fabrics for girdles, leg bindings, borders, 
  and decorative braids. We can say little about the looms, for if their warp 
  was stretched between the weaver's belt and a tree or table leg there would 
  be no archaeological trace.</p>
<p>Two devices can be recognised for opening the shed on a narrow warp: the rigid 
  heddle and weaving tablets. The rigid heddle of bone or wood was a flat frame 
  with alternating slots and slats, with holes in through which the warp threads 
  passed. By raising or depressing the heddle, two different sheds could be opened, 
  one above, the other below the general level of the warp. The first datable 
  rigid heddle is Roman, although its use carried on throughout the Medieval period. 
  However, there are no definite rigid heddles from the Viking Age.</p>
<p>Tablet weaving is one of the oldest European textile techniques, traceable 
  at least to the early Iron Age. The tablets are small flat squares, usually 
  of bone or wood, with a hole in each corner through which a warp thread is passed. 
  The tablets are held in the hand like a pack of cards, parallel to the warp, 
  and turned back or forward by half or quarter turns. This action twists the 
  four warp threads (controlled by each tablet) into a cord that can be locked 
  into position by a weft thread inserted between the turns. By varying the colours 
  of the warp yarn and the direction of the turn of the tablets, intricate warp 
  patterns can be created.</p>
<p>Tablet weaving could be further enhanced by '<em>brocading</em>'. This brocading was 
  achieved by using a second weft thread, which ran over some of the warp threads, 
  creating a pattern on the surface of the thread. Brocaded tablet-weaves were 
  usually of silk, using gold or silver thread for the brocaded pattern. This 
  type of braid was a very high status item, and was usually used to decorate 
  expensive garments.</p>

<p>Another method by which braids could have been produced is inkle weaving. Although 
  the origin of the word is unknown, an inkle is a coloured tape or braid similar 
  to the braids produced in tablet weaving. Like tablet weaving inkle weaving 
  is restricted to narrow widths, although as it is woven on a loom it is much 
  quicker and easier. Unfortunately the pattern variations are not as numerous 
  as in tablet weaving. On an inkle weaving loom alternate warp threads are leashed 
  to a peg whilst the others are left free - this creates the shed. The shed is 
  opened and closed by raising and lowering the free threads. These narrow braids 
  could also be woven on a small vertical loom similar to those used for weaving 
  wider fabrics. Braids have been found made from wool, linen, and silk. Some 
  have been enhanced by floating (brocaded) gold thread.</p>
<p>(The Webmaster would like to offer some more on the subject of the Inkle loom. 
  Some more recent study has cast doubt in the area of it's use in the 10th century. 
  The first hitch is the age of the name; the name 'Inkle' seems to be from the 
  Middle Ages rather than the Early Middle Ages. The second hitch is that you 
  don't need an Inkle Loom to produce the braids seen above. A Backstrap loom 
  would suffice or any variation upon that to produce complex patterns of band. 
  This would of course leave very little in the way of archaeological finds, and 
  perhaps answer why nothing in the way of looms as described have been found. 
  Ethnographic evidence from the Middle-East prior to WW2 shows ladies weaving 
  bands with backstrap looms made from little more than sticks.</p>

<p>Tablet weaving was a very skilled craft. The bands as they are known in most 
  countries, are often woven with the finest of wools - one of our weavers refers 
  to them as cobweb fine. The result is a very fine piece of work, with woven 
  bands less than 10mm wide common and demonstrating fantastic detail. Other original 
  examples have woven names or messages in the work or rows of animals. The number 
  of patterns possible are almost limitless, with certain patterns probably typical 
  of particular localities. Tablet weaving was one of the few occasions that almost 
  anyone could afford at least some expensively dyed threads that could be included 
  in the work, in an effort to 'jazz' up plainer clothing. The habit today is 
  to use contrasting tablet weave on garments, but this is possibly a modern practice.)</p>
