There is much more about the parallel port issue on

<a href="ele1pp.htm">this page</a>,

but just in case there's something new in this....<br><br>

If you want to send a pulse through the parallel port. In TurboPascal the source code is something like:<br>
port[$378] := 1;<br>
delay(100);<br>
port[$378] := 0;<br><br><br>

How can I 'translate' this to Delphi 3????<br><br>

Under Windows 95, that code should work, though it's not recommended. Under NT, you need a device driver, since application programs can't access ports directly.  See the resources available at http://www.lvr.com (Lakeview Research).<br><br>

===<br>
Someone asked...<br>

How do I print bitmaps for barcode work?<br><br>

Answers...<br>
Create a TImage<br>
Use CopyRect to copy the barcode to the TImage field<br>
Use TheImage.Picture.SaveToFile to save the bitmap to a file<br><br>

  TheImage.Canvas.CopyRect(rect(0,0,200,200),canvas,rect(0,0,200,200));<br><br>

where 0,0,200,200 is the position and dimension of your barcode on the canvas.<br><br>

----<br>Another answer...<br><br>

It's really very easy to print the bitmaps.  Try this...<br><br>
<pre>
  Printer.BeginDoc;
  Printer.Canvas.CopyRect(
    Rect(0,0,Bitmap.Width,Bitmap.Height),
    Bitmap.Canvas,
    Rect(0,0,Bitmap.Width,Bitmap.Height));
  Printer.EndDoc;
</pre>
Normally the printout is too small.  If so, just scale the Dest (see CopyRect help) rectangle by a value (ie: Bitmap.Width*4,BitmapHeight*4)<br><br>

How can I create a bordered window without a title bar?<br><br>

Well, you could set the BorderStyle of the Form to bsNone, although this makes the form ugly (no border). This can be rectified somwhat by placing a TPanel on the form, making its Align = alClient and the BevelWidth = 2 which gives an effective border.<br><br>

Subject: Re: Tab and F keys in Tur
Date: 16 Mar 1997 18:16:04 -0700

Here's a little program that should answer most questions about reading
characters the keyboard can generate.  While ReadKey cannot distinguish
between the right and left shift keys it will detect alt, function and arrow
keys.

It shows how the special/extended keys work, since certain
special keys will return the same value if you don't show the #00/xx
relationship:

Uses CRT;
Var C1,C2 : char;
begin
  repeat
    C1 := ReadKey; C2 := #00;
    if C1 = #00 then C2 := ReadKey;
    writeln (Ord(C1),'/',Ord(C2))
  until C1 = #27  { Escape }
end.

   BTW, the KeyPressed processing has virtually no pertinence in a
program which does this sort of processing - it's strictly for
application logic which must test for keyboard input.  Your code flushes
the keyboard buffer before processing a single keystroke - is that what
you want to happen in a complete program like this?

It's because 640x480x256 requires bank-switching which is somewhat more
difficult to program. It's possible however in protected mode and with the VESA
2.0 video standard to address one 640x480x256 page, or bigger ones, without bank
switching. I haven't tried that however.

What I do have is a real-mode unit for VESA 1.2 or higher. It can do decent
640x480x256 graphics and it also supports a multicolored mouse pointer. Many
routines are written in assembler (Borland Pascal 7.0 required!) so it should be
resonable fast. You can find this unit at:

http://home.worldonline.nl/~wpdejong/vesa.html

You get the source code too, so you can play a bit with that... :-)

In Delphi, as opposed to Pascal, there are 2
sorts of CONST - normal ones, that just work like in Pascal, and
can't be assigned to, and typed constants, which is what you're using
here.  The really good thing about them is that they allow you to
declare constants of (as far as I can tell) arbitrary complex type.
The really wierd thing about them is that they aren't constant!  They
seem to work exactly as static variables in C.  I think it's a bit of
a misfeature to overload the word CONST for this, but I suppose it
doesn't break existing code whereas adding a new reserved word might.
(somebody might have a variable called "static", for example).
<pre>

If you rewrote your routine as:

 PROCEDURE Tform1.Button1click;
 CONST c = 1;	{type is implicitly integer}
 BEGIN
     c := c + 1; {this is now illegal}
     edit1.text := inttostr (c)
 END;

You'd find that it wouldn't compile, because you had a normal constant
instead of a typed one.

Who was it said that thing about "variables that don't and constants
that aren't"?
