<p>Albert Productions, founded in 1963, was one of Australia's
first independent
record production companies. It is&nbsp;a subsidiary of the venerable
family-owned
Sydney publishing company J. Albert &amp; Son Pty Ltd, the oldest
independent
music publishing house in Australia.&nbsp;Albert
Productions was originally established as an independent record
production company but
in 1970&nbsp; they launched their own Albert Productions record
label and in 1973 they
established their own recording studio.</p>




<p>The head of Albert Productions
from its foundation in
1963 until his untimely death in 1990 was <a href="albert-ted.htm">Ted
Albert</a>. He was the great-grandson of Jacques Albert, a Swiss-born
music teacher
who migrated to Australia in 1884. Jacques and his son Michel Francois
(Frank)
established established the Albert music business in 1890 when they
began&nbsp; to
import violins. In the early 1900s Alberts became one of the leading
sheet music
publishers in Australia. Alberts published the <i>Boomerang
Songster</i>, containing
lyrics of&nbsp; popular songs, bought the Australian rights to
songs by Cole Porter, Irving
Berlin and other songwriters of the 1920s to 1940s and acted as the
local agent for many
overseas publishers.</p>




<p><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 84px; height: 84px; float: left;" alt="" src="images/stamp.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5"> <span class="caption">Left: an&nbsp;Alberts mechanical
royalty stamp from the late 1930s. These were issued to verify the
payment of
composer royalties and were affixed to the labels of records on which
the publishing was
owned or controlled by Alberts.</span>
</p>




<p>The business was carried on by Jacques' son Frank, his
grandson Alexis (later Sir
Alexis) and great-grandsons Ted and Tony (now both deceased) and
Robert. Not
surprisingly, given their prominence in music publishing, the Albert
family has also had a
long and close close association with the <a href="http://www.apra.com.au/">Australasian
Performing Rights Association (APRA)</a> throughout its history;
Frank Albert was one of
the signatories to APRA's Articles of Association when the Association
was formed in
1926. Until 1995 J. Albert &amp; Son also owned one of Australia's
largest radio
networks, which included <a href="http://www.milesago.com/radio/2uw.htm">2UW</a>,
Sydney's top pop station in the 1960s.</p>




<p>When Ted entered the family business he became interested in
building an Australian
catalogue to complement Albert's international repertoire. The
opportunity came when the
Beat Boom swept the world in 1963-64. Alberts decided to establish a
new division, Albert
Productions, to enable them to expand beyond their publishing
activities into record
production.</p>




<p>In June 1964 Ted's father Alexis wrote to their New York
lawyer (who had looked after
Alberts' publishing interests in the USA for many years). The letter
said in part:</p>




<p class="quote">"... the time is at hand for a real boom
in local compositions and
recordings and we have therefore entered this field with much more
drive than ever
before. We have formed an A&amp;R Department and have inaugurated a
recording
subsidiary we have called 'Albert Productions'."</p>




<p>Ted became the managing director of the new company, Albert
Productions. In the
mid-Sixties, working with A&amp;R man and co-producer Tony Geary,
Ted produced a
string of hit records for top acts including <a href="../artists/thorpe.htm">Billy Thorpe &amp; The
Aztecs</a>
and <a href="../artists/easybeats.htm">The Easybeats</a>
(and
Ted also played on some of the Easybeats records). Ted was also a
driving force behind
the Albert Productions record label and <a href="albert-studios.htm">Albert
Studios</a>, which he
established in the early Seventies in partnership with former Easybeats
<a href="vanda-young.htm">Harry Vanda and George
Young</a>. Together they were either the producers or executive
producers of the entire
Alberts roster, which dominated Australian pop in the late Seventies
and early
Eighties.</p>




<p>The formation of companies like Albert Productions was made
possible by the
changes that swept over the music industry in the 1950s, which led to
the emergence of a
new category within the music business -- the independent freelance
record producer.
Albert Productions was one of several such companies operating in
Australia in the
Sixties, including <a href="leopold-productions.htm">Leopold
Productions</a>, owned by
<a href="festival.htm">Festival</a> house producer <a href="iredale-robert.htm">Robert
Iredale</a>, and <a href="june-productions.htm">June
Productions</a>, run by former <a href="wandg.htm">W&amp;G</a>
and <a href="astor.htm">Astor</a> staff producer
(and
<a href="industry/fable.htm">Fable Records</a>
founder) <a href="tudor-ron.htm">Ron
Tudor</a>.</p>




<p>The catalyst for these changes was the invention that
revolutionised recording in the
years after WWII -- magnetic tape, which was developed by BASF audio
engineers in Germany in the mid-1930s. Before tape recorders were
introduced in the
early 1950s, the primary means of recording music was to record it
live, direct-to-disc, in a
single take. As the musicians played and sang, the sound was fed from
the studio to a
specially designed disc-cutting lathe (operated by trained engineers)
which physically cut
the audio track into the surface of an acetate master disc. This is the
reason that the
recording process is still sometimes referred to as "cutting a record".</p>




<p>Recording engineers were limited in what they could achieve
with the
available
technology -- the aural character of a recording was largely dependent
on studio acoustics
and microphone placement -- e.g. the distinctive sound of Bill Haley
&amp; The Comets'
records like "Rock Around The Clock" was achieved by recording them in
converted church with a domed ceiling. Mixing desks in those days had
very limited tone controls
and the only production effects were echo and reverberation. Before
tape,
this had to be created acoustically, by sending the sound to speaker
placed at one end of
a&nbsp;specially-constructed echo chamber; the echo-laden sound was
picked up by a
microphone at the other end of the chamber and relayed back into the
control panel,
where it could be mixed in with the 'dry' sound of the performers
playing in the anechoic
studio.</p>




<p>Prior to the introduction of magnetic tape, studio recording
was a capital-intensive
industry dominated by a handful of huge multinational record companies
like <a href="emi.htm">EMI</a>.
Typically, such companies
were organised as vertically-integrated businesses that owned every
level of the
record-making and selling process -- the studios (e.g. Abbey Rd) where
the recordings
were made, the factories where they were pressed, the warehouses from
which they were
distributed. Companies like CBS and RCA also owned major interests in
radio
broadcasting and/or they also manufactured gramophones and radio
receivers, and EMI owned the&nbsp;HMV record store chain to retail
its
own recordings.</p>




<p>Studios represented a sizeable capital investment in real
estate, plant and personnel.
They had to be large enough to accommodate many musicians (even an
orchestra) and
they needed additional rooms including echo chambers, control rooms, a
cutting rooms
and storerooms, and a permanent staff of trained recording engineers.
They were
expensive to run and expensive to hire. In general, only those
performers who had a
contract with a major company got to use the company studio. The only
other high-quality
studios available were those belonging to radio stations or to the
independent production
companies that made radio programmes under contract.</p>




<p>In the Fifties, the introduction of magnetic tape, multi-track
recorders and vinyl records
led to major changes in the structure of the music industry. The growth
of independent
recording studios, facilitated by the new technology and powered by the
huge boom in the
sale of rock'n'roll records, created created new strata within the
industry within which the
independent record labels and independent record producers could
operate.&nbsp;The advent of the commercial recordings studio --
where
facilities could be hired at an
hourly or daily rate by anyone who could afford the fees -- meant that
independent
production companies and small labels could now gain regular access to
quality
recording facilities for the first time. It also meant that the large
record companies were no
longer limited by what their house producers and engineers could record
in their own
studios. Major labels could supply the growing demand for rock'n'roll
records by
'outsourcing' recordings to independent producers, who were able to
hire these
commercial studios. The most famous independent studios -- like Olympic
Studios in
London or Goldstar in Los Angeles -- came to rival or even surpass the
large corporate
studios in terms of both prestige and the number of hits they produced.</p>




<p>Technically too, tape revolutionised the industry. Compared to
the cumbersome old
lathes and fragile acetate discs, tape recorders were small and easy to
operate; tape
offered superior fidelity, longer duration and enormously increased
flexibility. Tape could
also be used to create echo and reverberation electronically,
eliminating the need for
large echo chambers, thus reducing both the size of studios and the
cost of studio
construction. Indeed, many of Joe Meek's landmark productions were done
in his
home-made studio in Holloway Rd using basic single-track tape recorders.</p>




<p>More tape effects were developed during the mid-Sixties. In
1966, Abbey Rd engineer
Ken Townshend invented the&nbsp; Automatic Double Tracking (ADT)
technique,
first used on The Beatles' "Tomorrow Never Knows" in late 1966. Legend
has it that Townshend devised the technique in response to John
Lennon's frequent complaints about the tedium of having to double-track
his vocals.This clever
development of tape echo enabled engineers to 'double' a lead vocal
using a fractional
tape delay. It took the industry by storm and instantly became a
fundamental of popular music
recording, as well as saving countless hours of session time previously
taken by
time-consuming vocal overdubs. Not long after, Olympic Studio engineer
George Chkiantz developed the ADT technique further by inventing the
famous "flanging" effect, a phase-shift effect, first
used on The Small Faces' "Itchycoo Park" in 1967, which created the
striking
'swoshing' sound that can also be heard on records like Russell Morris'
"The Real
Thing".</p>




<p>Above all, tape meant that recordings could now be precisely
edited, or enhanced by
'overdubbing' to or from other tapes. Tape made it possible for the
first time to assemble
the best possible performances, piece by piece, over time and even in
different locations.
Producers could now pick and choose the best (or the cheapest) studio,
or as Brian
Wilson did on <i>Good Vibrations</i>, they could use the
distinctive 'sound' of different
studios for different sections of a song. By the late Fifties,
multi-track tape was making it
possible to record voices and instruments separately, resulting in
vastly improved fidelity
and clarity, and it also allowed producers to create distinct aural
environments for each
element, rather than having one 'sound' for the entire ensemble.</p>




<p>In Australia, independent commercial studios began to appear
in the late Fifties and
early Sixties. In the mid-to-late Sixties and early Seventies, the
upper end of this new
market was occupied by studios like <a href="armstrongs.htm">Armstrong's</a>,
<a href="unitedsound.htm">United Sound</a>, <a href="natec.htm">Natec</a>, <a href="telefil.htm">Telelfil</a>
and <a href="tcs.htm">TCS</a>, but there were also
many
small operators like <a href="byrne-ossie.htm">Ozzie
Byrne</a>. His tiny <a href="stclair-studio.htm">St
Clair</a> studio in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville was a
home-made, two-room studio,
set up in a former butcher's shop, and equipped with second-hand mono
recorders -- but
it was the site of some very significant Australian recordings,
including The Bee Gees'
breakthrough hit "Spicks and Specks".</p>




<p>Thus, producers like Mickie Most, Burt Bacharach, Shel Talmy
and Ted Albert created
a new niche in the music industry -- production subcontractors who, for
a fee and/or a
percentage of the record sales, would sign performers to a production
contract and then
make a deal to supply the record company with finished recordings ready
for mastering,
manufacture and release. For those who were able to produce successful
records, it
proved to be a hugely lucrative enterprise -- the late Mickie Most,
producer of The Animals,
Donovan, Jeff Beck, The Seekers and founder of RAK Studios in London,
was reported to
have been worth more than $50 million dollars by the time he died in
May 2003.</p>




<p>Before Albert Productions built their own recording studio in
1973, they recorded at the
<a href="../radio/2uw.htm">2UW</a> studios and the
old 2UW Radio Theatre in George St, Sydney as well as other studios
such as the EMI and Phillips studios in Sydney and <a href="armstrongs.htm">Armstrong's Studios</a> in
Melbourne.&nbsp;Typically, Alberts would sign new acts to a
production contract; then,once the
performer/s had secured a recording contract, Albert would hire a
studio where they would
record and produce songs. The finished tapes were then leased to the
record company,
which would master, press, distribute and (hopefully) promote the
records. Alberts could
benefit further if they signed their acts to a publishing contract with
J. Albert &amp; Son,
which would generate more income from royalties and sheet music sales
if the records
sold well.</p>




<p>This arrangement was similar to those between major British
independent producers
like Mickie Most and Shel Talmy and the companies who released the acts
they produced,
e.g. The Animals and The Who. Albert Production set up a deal with the
Australian division
of <a href="emi.htm">EMI</a>, which leased the
tapes
from Alberts to manufacture and distribute the records on their <a href="parlophone.htm">Parlophone</a>
label.&nbsp;Albert Productions' first signing was leading Sydney
band <a href="../artists/thorpe.htm"> Billy Thorpe
&amp; The Aztecs.</a>
They shot to the top of the Australian charts in June 1964 -- right in
the middle of The
Beatles' tour of Australia -- with their 'beat' version of "Poison
Ivy". After signing with
Albert they scored a top ten hit with "Mashed Potato" in August 1964<i>,
</i>the
beginning of an eleven-hit run that included "Sick &amp; Tired"
(#2) and "Over The
Rainbow" (#1).</p>




<p>Albert's next signing made Australian music history. Ted was
friends with a former
real estate agent, Mike Vaughan, who had recently become the manager of
a new Sydney
band, <a href="../artists/easybeats.htm">The Easybeats</a>.
Vaughan was on the lookout for a label who was interested in recording
them. Vaughan
convinced Ted to attend a private performance, and one listen was
enough to convince
Ted that he had a hot property on his hands. Although he was a novice
producer, Ted had
an intuitive gift for selecting material, finding the right sound and
honing the 'feel' of a song
-- skills later highly praised by The Easybeats' main writer, George
Young.</p>




<p>Within the week The Easys were signed to a recording contract
with Albert
Productions. Their first single made a minor impact in Sydney but their
second release,
"She's So Fine" (May 1965) broke them nationally. Recorded at the
soon-to-be-famous <a href="armstrongs.htm">Armstrong's
Studios</a> in
Melbourne, with a backing track produced by the legendary <a href="savage-roger.htm">Roger Savage</a>, the song
shot to #1 in Sydney and #5 in Melbourne. It was the first of eight
consecutive
Australian top ten hits in just 18 months and all their classic
Australian recordings were
produced by Ted.</p>




<p>By 1966 The Easybeats were the top group in the country, and
there were high hopes
for overseas success after manager Mike Vaughan managed to secure a
contract with
United Artists in mid-1966 to release their records internatinally. The
band arranged to go
to the UK in hopes of breaking into the charts internationally and Ted
accompanied the
group when they moved there UK in late 1966. He produced a number of
tracks for them
at Abbey Rd (most still offically unrelased to this day) but they were
rejected by the record
company and Ted returned home. Alberts enjoyed continued success in
Australia with
The Easybeats -- "Friday On My Mind" topped the Ausstralian charts late
in 1966 and
also reached #6 in the U.K and #16 in the U.S.A. At the 2001 APRA
awards, "Friday On
My Mind" was named as the most influential Australian song of the past
75 years.</p>




<p>1965-66 was a peak period for Alberts. As well as The
Easybeats, Alberts also signed
and recorded two other now-legendary (if shortlived) Sydney bands, <a href="../artists/missinglinks.htm">The Missing Links</a>
and <a href="../artists/throb.htm">The Throb</a>.
They scored an
unexpected coup in 1966 when they signed Melbourne duo <a href="../artists/bobby_laurie.htm">Bobby &amp; Laurie</a>,
who
had been the one of the first 'Beat' acts to make the charts in
Australia in 1964. Thought to
have been past their prime, they came to Alberts after leaving the <a href="go-label.htm">Go!!</a> label and confounded
critics by scoring three more Top 20 hits including "Sweet &amp;
Tender Romance",
and their #1 hit "Hitchhiker".</p>




<p>The late Sixties seems to have been a relatively quiet period
for Alberts; The Missing
Links, The Throb and Bobby &amp; Laurie had all split up by the end
of 1967 and the
company appears to have produced few original recordings during this
time. The
Easybeats stayed on in England until they broke up end of the decade
after a farewell
Australian tour. Although Alberts continued to release their records,
including their
swansong <i>St Louis</i> in 1969, these were all produced
overseas, recorded mostly in
London and produced most by Vanda and Young.</p>




<p>From 1963 and 1970 Albert Productions' recordings were
released under the lease
deal with EMI and released on their <a href="parlophone.htm">
Parlophone</a> imprint -- the
same label as The Beatles. When Alberts resumed record production in
1970 they
launched their own label, also called Albert Productions; this time the
records were
pressed, released and distributed by <a href="emi.htm">EMI</a>.&nbsp;After
the end of the Easybeats, the group's songwriting and production team <a href="vanda-young.htm">Harry Vanda and George
Young</a>, had stayed in England, working to pay off the debts
they (and their
management) had run up during their UK sojourn. They wrote and recorded
demos for
other artists; and they released their own records under a variety of
pseudonyms. Some of
the songs they wrote were recorded by Australian performers, including <a href="../artists/furber.htm">Mike Furber</a> ("I'm On
Fire" and "Watch Me Burn") and <a href="../artists/maccallum.htm">Alison
MacCallum</a>, who had
a Top Ten hit in 1972 with the Vanda-Young composition "Superman"
(released on
<a href="rca.htm">RCA</a>).</p>




<p>The first record released on the new Albert label was by
British-born singer-songwriter
<a href="../artists/mulry.htm">Ted Mulry</a>. It was
an auspicious
beginning -- Ted's version of Vanda &amp; Young's "Falling In Love
Again" was a
Top Ten hit on several capital city charts. Ted had already scored a
top five hit with his self
penned track, "Julia", earlier that year. Ted went on to form a group,
TMG (the Ted
Mulry Gang) they scored an Australian national #1 hit in 1975 Ted's
"Jump In My Car",
which was followed by their remake of the 1917 jazz standard "Darktown
Strutter's
Ball" which reached #2 in 1976.</p>




<p>The event that began the re-birth of Albert Productions as a
force in the Australian
record industry was the signing of John Paul Young, the former lead
singer of Sydney
band <a href="../artists/elmtree.htm">Elm Tree</a>,
who was
then featuring in <i><a href="../stage/superstar.htm">
Jesus
Christ Superstar</a></i>. Early that year British producer
and impresario Simon
Napier-Bell had come to Australia to scout for new talent and produce
records for Alberts.
The first single he recorded was "Pasadena", a song sent from England
by Vanda
&amp; Young with lyrics co-written by British actor David Hemming.
It was a Top Ten hit in
Sydney in April 1972 and its success enabled Ted Albert to persude
George Young and
Harry Vanda to return to Australia to run a recording studio for Albert
records. Napier-Bell
also produced "Excuse Me", which was a moderate hit (#29) in 1974 for <a href="../Artists/maccallum.htm">Alison
MacCallum</a>.</p>




<p>In late 1973 Harry and George returned from the UK and
re-established themselves in
Australia in partnership with Ted Albert; this was facilitated by the
fact that in the
mid-Sixties, they had opted to take a share in Albert Productions in
lieu of cash. Their
immense production and songwriting talents were instrumental in making
the Albert label
one of Australia's most successful record companies. Vanda &amp;
Young went on to
produce hit records for many Australian acts as well as working on
various side projects
themselves.</p>




<p>With Harry and George's on board, Albert Productions then
established their own
recording studio. Albert Studios was located in the heart of the Sydney
CBD on the fifth
floor of a building in King St, Sydney, between the MLC Centre and
Centrepoint tower.
Originally known as Studio 139, Alberts' Studio 1 soon became <i>the</i>
rock studio in
Sydney. To cope with the demand Alberts' Studio 2 was constructed in
1976 and Studio 3
was added in 1979. The King St complex was closed and the studios
relocated to
Cremorne in 1986.</p>




<p>Albert Studios became the "hit factory" of Australian pop from
1974 onwards; . For
almost a decade from 1974 until the mid-Eighties, Vanda &amp; Young
productions
dominated the Australian charts. One of their first projects was for <a href="../artists/wright.htm">Stevie Wright</a>, for
whom they wrote
and produced the epic 11-minute, three-part single "Evie" and his debut
solo album
<i>Hard Road</i>. "Evie" was a #1 smash hit and was also
named 1974
'Song Of The Year'. Other Vanda &amp; Young productions during this
period inlcuded <a href="../artists/lowndes.htm">Graham
Lowndes</a>,
Bartholemew John, <a href="../artists/marchini.htm">Bobbi
Marchini</a>, Jackie Christian &amp; Target and S.J.C. Powell.</p>




<p>At the same time as reviving Stevie's career, Vanda &amp;
Young were also playing a key role launching the careers of George's
two younger brothers, Angus and Malcolm, and their new band <a href="../artists/ac-dc.htm">AC/DC</a>. George's
younger brothers
Angus and Malcolm were given their first taste of the recording
industry whilst working on
the <a href="vanda-young.htm">Marcus Hook Roll
Band</a> project in early 1974 and it was shortly after that they
formed AC/DC. With Harry
and George's guidance, and the skills of Albert's house engineer Bruce
Brown, AC/DC
scored hit after hit in Australia between 1975 and 1980, including rock
classic like "High
Voltage", "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap", "Jailbreak" and the immortal
"It's A Long
Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)" which shot straight into
the top five
followed by their first national #1, "TNT". In 1977, after relocating
to London, AC/DC
had a British top twenty album with <i>Let There Be Rock</i>.
Despite the tragic
death of Bon Scott in February 1980 the band soldiered on, recruiting a
new vocalist, Brian
Johnson. Their next album, <i>Back In Black</i> became
their biggest record to
date with "You Shook Me All Night Long". AC/DC were recently named by
RIAA as the
fifth-highest-selling recording act in American music history. Their
worldwide sales now
total almost 100 million, with over 60 million records sold in the USA
alone.</p>




<p>Many producers would have been content with AC/DC's tremendous
success, but
Vanda &amp; Young never rested on their laurels. Adept at almost
every style of popular
music, they churned out hit after hit for the ever-growing Alberts
stable of artists. <a href="../artists/shakespeare.htm">William
Shakespeare</a>
scored two consecutive number one hits in 1974 with "Can't Stop Myself
From Loving
You" and "My Little Angel".&nbsp;In 1975 Vanda &amp; Young took
over the production of <a href="../artists/jpy.htm">John
Paul Young</a>, and their song
"Yesterday's Hero" gave John his first national #1. Under Vanda
&amp; Young's
guidance he became the most successful Australian solo singer of the
late '70s. After
several major Australian and South African hits including "The Love
Game" and "I
Hate The Music", JPY broke into the European charts for the first time
with "Standing
In The Rain". In 1978 John's classic rendition of "Love Is In The Air"
gave him and
Vanda &amp; Young a success to rival "Friday On My Mind" -- it
reached #3 in
Australia, #5 in the U.K and #7 in the U.S. It has since become the
most covered Vanda
&amp; Young composition of all time.</p>




<p>Vanda &amp; Young also recorded themselves. During studio
down-time they
recorded "Hey St. Peter" (an old Easybeats-era song) and issued it
under the
pseudonym "Flash &amp; The Pan". With support from <a href="../tv/countdown.htm">Countdown</a>, it hurtled
up the
charts, reaching #2 in January 1977. The follow-up "Down Among The Dead
Men" went Top Ten in Australia and also charted in the UK. Possibly
aided by fact that The
Easybeats had always enjoyed a strong following in Europe, Flash
&amp; The Pan
scored several more Top Forty European hits, including the U.K Top Ten
hit "Waiting
For A Train" in 1983; another Flash &amp; The Pan song, "Walking In
The Rain", was covered by Grace Jones.&nbsp;In the late Seventies,
Alberts consolidated their position by signing inportant new acts
including The Angels, Rose Tattoo, Heroes, Cheetah and Choirboys. The
Angels' first
Alberts release, the 1976 classic single "Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face
Again" is
one of the best-known and most popular Aussie rock songs never to have
charted, as
was another Angels standard, "Coming Down". But in 1978 the band
finally hit the
Australian charts with <i>Take A Long Line</i> and also
amde inroads in Europe.</p>




<p>Female vocal duo Cheetah (sisters Chrissie and Lyndsay
Hammond) scored
a Top 20 hit in 1980 and also enjoyed European success with the single
"Spend The
Night" from the album <i>Rock And Roll Women</i>. The
Hammonds worked
extensively with Vanda &amp; Young, and provided backing vocals on
many Alberts
recordings. Now based in the UK, Chrissie Hammond has recorded
extensively with
keyboard maestro Rick Wakeman.&nbsp;Rose Tattoo were another
important signing. Their first single for Alberts,
produced by Harry and George, was "Bad Boy For Love". It reached #10
and over the
next six years Rose Tattoo became one of the top bands in
Australia,scoring five Top Forty
hits, including the 1983 classic "We Can't Be Beaten".&nbsp;<a href="http://www.choirboys.net/" target="top">Choirboys</a>
formed in
1979 they became a major draw at Sydney's Royal Antler Hotel (formerly
the unofficial
"HQ" for Midnight Oil) and in 1983 went into the studio with producer
(and former Ol' 55
member) Jim Manzie to record their self-titled album and single "Never
Gonna Die".
Manzie also worked with Vanda and Young on several Flash &amp; the
Pan
recordings.</p>




<p>The connection between NZ-born singer Mark Williams and Vanda
and Young
went back to Mark's NZ #1 hit in 1970 with his version of the
V&amp;Y track "Yesterday
Was Just The Beginning". In 1990 Mark was signed by Alberts and scored
a Top 5 hit
with <i>Show No Mercy</i>. This was followed by the <i>ZNZ</i>
album and a
second album <i>Mind Over Matter</i> which featured not
only tracks writtten by
Mark but also the Vanda / Young composition "We Can Dream".</p>




<p>In 1989 Ted moved into film, forming M&amp;A Productions
(Miall &amp; Albert) and
commissioned a young theatrical director, Baz Luhrman, to write and
direct their first
project. Tragically, Ted Albert didn't live to see the huge success of
his first film -- he died
suddenly from a heart attack during 1990. The film was <i>Strictly
Ballroom.</i>
It of
course went on to win eight AFI Awards and the coveted 'Priz De La
Jeunesse' at the
Cannes film festival. It was the #1 box office hit in Australia in 1992
and the centrepiece of
the movie's soundtrack, the remake of "Love is in the Air", reached #2
on the
Australian charts, and had considerable worldwide success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In
recognition of his huge contributions to the Australian music industry,
Ted Albert
was granted a posthumous Lifetime Achievement award at the 1990 ARIA
Awards, and in
his honour the Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA)
established the
annual Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music.</p>




<p>In 1999 J. Albert &amp; Son signed an exclusive print
agreement with the major UK
publisher Music Sales. The two companies had worked together since
1972, when
Music Sales UK and Albert &amp; Son set up Music Sales Australia as
a joint venture.
Later the Albert group took over distribution while Music Sales
supplied most of the
international product from London and New York. The new agreement was
timely: earlier
that year Sydney was hit by the most destructive hailstorm in the
nation's history, and most
of the stock in Music Sales Australia's warehouse was destroyed, and
their warehouse
was closed for two months.</p>




<p>Today the Albert empire is run "quietly and conservatively" by
Ted's
younger brother
Robert Albert, who is now in his late 60s. Albert Productions is run by
CEO
Fifa Riccobono. Albert's long-serving A&amp;R manager Sam Horsburgh
is also a member of the Young clan -- he is married to Margaret Young
(who named AC/DC) and in the Sixties he was The Easybeats' road
manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well as owning a large share and property
portfolio,
the Albert family maintains its
118-year involvement with the Australian music industry. The Alberts
have for some years
been included in Business Review Weekly's "Rich 200", their annual list
of Australia's 200
richest families and in 2002 BRW estimated the family's worth at AU$190
million (up by $20
million from the previous year).</p>




<p>Interviewed by BRW in 2002, Robert said: "Music is my first
love. It is my family
heritage and we will always be involved in music.&nbsp;It is
hard for a family
company to compete in the international music industry these days. We
are good at
spotting talent, working up talent, and vetting new songs. But the
minute a new talent is
identified, a big recording company steps in."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Albert Studios
recently diversified into the
writing and production of music for television commercials, and the
Albert family are
also partners in a joint venture with <a target="new" href="http://www.stuartandsons.com/">Stuart &amp; Sons</a>,
the Newcastle-based
company that is making a new generation of innovative
Australian-designed,
Australian-made concert grand pianos which have been hailed as the
biggest advance in piano design for more than 200 years.</p>




<p>In recent years Albert Productions established an office and a
recording studio in
London, and in June 2002 they signed a new marketing and distribution
agreement with
Festival Mushroom Records, but this&nbsp;lapsed when the
Festival Mushroom group was wound up in late 2005. In 2006, following
the liquidation of FMR, Alberts signed a&nbsp;new distribution deal
with Sony-BMG Australia.</p>
