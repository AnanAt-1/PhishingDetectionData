The award-winning hit features a mash-up of hip-hop, R\u0026B, and soul songs performed by a diverse cast.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Hamilton moved to New York in the hope of a better life. While there, there he impressed those around him with his hunger for revolution and reform. The story sees Hamilton become George Washington's right-hand man, fall in love, and go on to become the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. \n\n## About *Hamilton the Musical*\n\nThe seeds for the *Hamilton* musical were planted when composer Lin-Manuel Miranda purchased a copy of Ron Chernow's biography, *Alexander Hamilton*. Within a few pages, Miranda started to envision the revolutionary's life in musical form and embarked on the project in 2009 by penning *The Hamilton Mixtape* — a number of songs that would later go on to form the show. \n\nDuring this time, he was invited to the White House to perform at an evening of Poetry, Music, and Spoken Word in front of President Barack Obama and the First Lady. He treated audiences to the song \"Alexander Hamilton\", which was met with scattered laughter from the crowd. After workshopping the mixtape, *Hamilton* finally received its Off-Broadway premiere at the Public Theater in 2015 before later transferring to Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre.\n\n## Why does the show *Hamilton* resonate with audiences? \n\n*Hamilton* has left a major impression on audiences since it first premiered Off-Broadway in 2015. The show offers a unique perspective of one of the lesser-known founding fathers using an innovative approach to make the story more relevant and engaging to a modern audience with its infusion of hip-hop and rap and commitment to diverse casting.\n\nThe musical won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, making it the first musical to win the award since 2010 and the 9th musical to win the accolade since 1930. *Hamilton* went on to win 11 Tony Awards, six Olivier Awards, and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. \n\n[In a five-star review on London Theatre, our critic raves:](https://www.londontheatre.co.uk/reviews/review-hamilton-is-here-to-stay-at-the-victoria-palace-theatre) “Just as Les Miserables has proved to be a universal story, stretching far beyond its deeply etched story of revenge, retribution and revolution to speak to a human need for healing and forgiveness, so Hamilton captures the heartbeat and heartbreak of a nation trying to find itself - and relates it directly to a pursuit it is still engaged in trying to define anew today”\n\n## Who wrote *Hamilton*?\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda wrote the *Hamilton* musical. His Hamilton score features a fusion of emotive songs that combine hip-hop, R\u0026B, soul, and classical musical theatre numbers, while the musical is entirely sung-through by its cast. Since its premiere, Hamilton shot into the public consciousness. It won 11 Tony Awards, including Outstanding Musical and all four acting categories.\n\nLondon welcomed the West End production of *Hamilton* in 2017 at the newly refurbished Victoria Palace Theatre. The musical won a record-equalling seven Olivier Awards, including Best Musical and Outstanding Achievement in Music. *Hamilton* in London has well and truly found a second home.\n\n## Tickets to Hamilton are available now\n\nBook your *Hamilton* tickets on London Theatre today.\n","heroImage":null,"genres":[{"entryTitle":"All Shows (LON)","tag":"All Shows","hideTag":["Yes"],"contentModelType":"tag","entryId":"3CzGDLSKs3yVWXzeicUdnL","updatedAt":"2023-02-03T15:16:42.596Z"},{"entryTitle":"Weekday Matinees","tag":"Weekday Matinees","url":"weekday-matinees","contentModelType":"tag","entryId":"34aQmc33wl4hCAOXJrZ4Si","updatedAt":"2022-01-06T22:14:38.689Z"}],"salesMessage":"This groundbreaking musical tells the story of Alexander Hamilton through powerful storytelling, hip-hop, and themes of ambition, revolution, and legacy.","slug":"hamilton-tickets","faqs":[{"entryTitle":"ALL - PDP - Short description - Template","question":"What is [Product Name] about?","answer":"[Short Description]","contentModelType":"faq","entryId":"hkh4p8FiNCkf07wpY5cCn","updatedAt":"2023-09-27T17:55:44.722Z"},{"entryTitle":"LT/NYTG - PDP - Show - Venue - Template","question":"Where is [Product Name] playing?","answer":"[Product Name] is playing at [Venue].

Not everyone is best pleased though, with King George III making appearances for a hilarious British vs. American rivalry.\n\nThe *Hamilton* musical is a 21st-century cultural phenomenon. Its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda was catapulted to superstardom after playing the title role on Broadway. It’s also made stars of its original West End cast too, including Giles Terera and Jamael Westman. So go back in time to 18th-century America and witness the musical theatre marvel that is *Hamilton* in London. \n\n## What to Watch For:\n\n- Most people know that *Hamilton* is a biographical musical detailing the life of the Founding Father. But, creating a musical based on one man isn't easy. So where did Lin-Manuel Miranda get his inspiration from? While on holiday, Lin-Manuel Miranda read Ron Chernow’s biography about the revolutionary, and early ideas for *Hamilton* were born.\n- Lin-Manuel Miranda gave a work-in-progress performance of the opening song “Alexander Hamilton” at the White House in 2009 for President Barack Obama. The number would eventually become the show’s opening song. Since then, the original Broadway *Hamilton* cast performed at the White House.\n- Miranda isn't a one-trick pony. His other musicals include *In The Heights* and *Bring It On*, and he's also worked on films such as *Moana* and *Encanto.*\n- In London, *Hamilton* won seven Olivier Awards from 13 nominations. Currently, it equals the record for most Oliviers won by a musical, tied with *Matilda the Musical*. \n- The *Hamilton* musical features traditional musical theatre songs, but there's plenty of rap too. The rap song “Guns and Ships” performed by the character, Marquis de Lafayette breaks records as the fastest song in any musical. There's an average of 6.3 words per second in the song. That's fast!","posterImage":{"title":"Hamilton Poster - LON","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6pezt69ih962/1LDjWFwIBcfRSEXA4BkL8T/860fedcfedf0a467703e9afa4caa67b0/prod_1580719924849_HamPoster.jpg","details":{"size":61779,"image":{"width":480,"height":720}},"fileName":"prod_1580719924849_HamPoster.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"salesMessage":"Join the revolution!

Book *Stereophonic* Tickets on TodayTix.\n\nTake a trip back in time to the mid-1970s to a recording studio in California where the pressure is on for a nameless rock band inspired by Fleetwood Mac and their fraught recording of *Rumours*. Following the success of their first record, the band is on the cusp of stardom with their sophomore record, which they work on over the course of a year. However, tensions run high through internal conflicts and they need to reach a compromise about what to cut off their too-long record. \n\nSee original US cast members Andrew R Butler (R*ags Parkland Sings The Songs Of The Future*), Eli Gelb (*Skintight, Indignation*), and Chris Stack (*Your Mother's Copy of the Kama Sutra, Marie Antoinette*) reprise their roles from the original production and make their London stage debut. \n","additionalBodyCopy":"*Stereophonic* is a play that premiered at Playwrights Horizons before it transferred to Broadway, where it was an instant hit. It earned an unprecedented 13 Tony Award nominations, the most for any play ever. The show won five Tony Awards for Best Play, Best Featured Actor, Best Direction, Best Scenic Design, and Best Sound Design of a Play.\n\n*Stereophonic* in London boasts an exceptional creative team including writer David Adjmi, original music by Arcade Fire's Will Butler, direction by Daniel Aukin, scenic design by David Zinn, costume design by Enver Chakartash, lighting design by Jiyoun Chang, orchestrations by Will Butler and Justin Craig, sound design by Ryan Rumery, and hair and wig design by Robert Pickens and Katie Gell. \n\nAs the [5-star review from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/19/stereophonic-play-review-broadway) said, \"*Stereophonic* is meticulous. Bell bottoms and billowing shirts expertly mark the play's \"free love\" era (Enver Chakartash designed a kaleidoscopic wardrobe of costumes). The scenic design by David Zinn is granular in creating the recording studio, complete with wooden walls and brown carpeting.\"\n\n## What to watch for \n\n- David Adjmi worked on *Stereophonic* for 10 years. \n- This play is inspired by Fleetwood Mac. Another piece of media inspired by the band is the television show *Daisy Jones and the Six*. \n- The play earned Best Play from the Drama Desk Awards, the Drama League Awards, the Outer Critic Circle Awards, and the New York Drama Critics Circle Awards. \n- This fly-on-the-wall play was created to feel like audiences are intimately watching the story unfold.

In the course of the first 50 years, according to the programme notes, over 10 million people have seen the show and over 395 tons of ice cream have been sold!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what is the show's success? Part of it has to do with the fame of playwright Agatha Christie. In 1962 UNESCO announced that she was the most widely read British writer in the world, beating even Shakespeare, who came a miserable second. As the creator of such famous sleuths as Miss Jane Marple and the famous French, sorry Belgian, Detective Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie is the most famous 'whodunnit' crime writer of all time. Who has not heard of \"Death on the Nile\" or \"Murder on the Orient Express\"?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgatha Christie's fame has surely played a part in this show's success. In the 1950's Christie's books were regularly in the top sellers list. It was hardly surprising that a play, which has never been published or turned into a movie or tv programme, should attract avid fans. Since that initial enthusiasm the show has now become one of the essential things to do on many a tourists schedule - go to Buckingham Palace, visit the Tower of London and see 'The Mousetrap'.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe play is your regular 'whodunit' mystery. Eight people are snowed in at a guest house: Mollie and Giles Ralston, the owners; four invited guests, each with eccentric characteristics; the unexpected guest, who turns up out of the blue after his car overturns in the snow storm; and finally a skiing detective. Once everyone has arrived it is not long before a murder takes place and the detective assembles all the guests together and interrogates them one by one. Each avoid the truth, some by silence and others by lies? Can the murderer be caught before more deaths happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story, whilst sensational and full of silly coincidences, is actually quite good.

It’s a British institution. Since opening at the Ambassadors Theatre, London in 1952, *The Mousetrap* continues over 70 years on as the world’s longest-running play. The Agatha Christie play offers a mixture of 1950s drawing-room comedy and murder mystery.\n\nEven though it’s the oldest West End show with 1950s characters, *The Mousetrap* is still relevant. London Theatre praised Agatha Christie’s skilful writing, saying: “the characters are vivid and they interact amongst themselves with macabre amusement.” \n\nBut what’s a murder mystery without a murderer? London Theatre hinted that “there are enough false clues to keep you guessing and a few hidden ones.” Audiences are encouraged to keep the secrets and not tell anyone the murderer’s identity. So the only way you’ll be part of this theatre history is to see *The Mousetrap* live.\n\n*The Mousetrap* play is set at Monkswell Manor, a newly-opened guesthouse. The residents become snowed in with no means of contacting anyone from the outside world. News on the radio reveals that a woman has been murdered, and a note is found attached to her body.

Add that to *The Mousetrap*’s record-breaking West End run, and it’s fair to say that Agatha Christie changed the landscape of the English language. \n\nAgatha Christie didn’t think much of *The Mousetrap* when it first opened though. Christie originally wrote the play for radio, and it later became a play, that at the time, Christie thought would only run for around 8 months. *The Mousetrap* play was written as a gift for Queen Mary’s 80th birthday in 1947. Agatha Christie then gave her grandson, Mathew Pritchard, the rights to the play for his ninth birthday.\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n- Look out for the wooden sign at the entrance to St. Martin's Theatre — it tallies up the number of performances to date and will let you know which performance of this record-breaking show you are attending.\n- The clock above the fireplace in the main hall is the same clock that was used on opening night in 1952.\n- In 2012, a star-studded cast including Patrick Stewart, Julie Walters, and Tamsin Greig took part in *The Mousetrap*.\n- Former cast members have given record-breaking contributions. One of the original cast members, David Guyler, provided the prerecorded voice of the newsreader in the shop.\n- David Raven is in the Guiness Book of Records as the “Most Durable Actor” having performed 4,575 performances as Major Metcalf.

In 1978, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s new musical, *Evita*, made a star of its leading lady, Elaine Paige. Paige then starred in *Chess* and *Anything Goes*, both at the Prince Edward Theatre.\n\nThe building was completely refurbished in 1992. Bernard Delfont and Cameron Mackintosh now owned the theatre, and spent over £3 million on remodelling the auditorium, improving the acoustics and increasing the size of the stage. The new Prince Edward Theatre was unveiled in March 1993 with the opening of *Crazy for You*, a Gershwin musical transferring from Broadway.\n\nDelfont Mackintosh Theatres Ltd. continue to renovate the theatre between productions, making the faceight-yearemplary and one of the most desirable spaces in the West End.\n\n## Prince Edward Theatre Seating Information\n\nThe auditorium has three levels – the Stalls, Dress Circle and Grand Circle. In the Stalls, patrons will find excellent legroom throughout, and a gentle rake throughout the auditorium allows for excellent views. \n\nThe Dress Circle does not offer the same level of legroom, but again offers great views. The last five rows will have their view obstructed by the overhang of the, Grand Circle. \n\nThe Dress Circle loges are a unique feature to this theatre — they take on the form of individual, tiered boxes but with a direct view of the stage rather than the side-on view usually associated with box seats. \n\nThe Grand Circle offers excellent sightlines as the seats are fairly steeply raked.","shortDescription":"The Prince Edward Theatre, opened in 1930, hosted famous musicals, underwent major refurbishment in the '90s, and provides excellent views from all seating levels.","contentModelType":"venueRetailerOverride","entryId":"7yi0BsO9z51xNeTT5YJlhl","updatedAt":"2024-07-04T20:35:08.512Z"},{"entryTitle":"Prince Edward Theatre - TodayTix","retailer":{"retailerId":"TodayTix","contentModelType":"retailer","entryId":"tlryQTleP2xWAKpSkEbmY","updatedAt":"2025-05-14T15:21:05.450Z"},"name":"Prince Edward Theatre","description":null,"contentModelType":"venueRetailerOverride","entryId":"6Ng21L9hx1Kh7HUZqBs5b5","updatedAt":"2024-02-13T18:41:32.131Z"}],"contentModelType":"venue","entryId":"5PCw1RFxO8KePgDKKeYq5z","updatedAt":"2024-09-29T21:49:22.813Z"},"shortDescription":"He is one of the greatest entertainers of all time.

When an MTV camera crew arrives to interview Jackson for a documentary, the singer gradually opens up about his turbulent backstory and career. His memories come to life with some of his most famous songs, including “Billie Jean,” “Beat It,” “Thriller,” and “Smooth Criminal,” and a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage.\n\nThis production provides a unique look into the unseen elements — including his family relationships, phenomenal talent, and creative imagination — that inspired Jackson’s singular approach to music. As on Broadway, Christopher Wheeldon OBE directs and choreographs *MJ* in London. He won a Tony Award for his choreography, which he co-created with Rich and Tone Talauega, two of Jackson’s former backup dancers and collaborators. They helped Wheeldon to ensure the choreography in the show replicated the pop star’s signature style.\n\nElizabeth Taylor named Michael Jackson The King of Pop at the 1989 Soul Train Awards, and it is fair to say that he is an artist like no other. With over 350 million records sold worldwide, Jackson has earned himself spots in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. He is also the only music artist in the Dance Hall of Fame. \n\n*MJ the Musical* tickets are available on London Theatre now.

The spectacular *MJ the Musical* makes its West End debut, celebrating the life and music of the King of Pop with some of his most iconic songs, including “Thriller,” “Billie Jean,” and “Man in the Mirror.” This show is a must-see for any Michael Jackson fan or anyone simply looking for a bonafide musical thriller. Book *MJ the Musical* tickets on Box Office.\n\n*MJ the Musical* arrives straight from Broadway, where the show won four Tony Awards, including Best Choreography for acclaimed director/choreographer Christopher Wheeldon, who brought on Jackson's actual dancers to make the moves authentic. Myles Frost reprises his Tony Award-winning performance as Jackson from Broadway, which made him the youngest solo actor to ever win Best Leading Actor in a Musical.\n\nAll these elements make *MJ* a \"flawless production\" and \"the platinum standard\" of jukebox musicals, as New York Theatre Guide hailed in a five-star review. *MJ the Musical* takes place at rehearsals for the musician's 1992 Dangerous World Tour, where an MTV camera crew comes to interview him. He reflects on his career from his early days as a child star to his rise to fame as one of the most influential musicians of all time, giving audiences a singular look into his creative process and dedication to his art.\n\nDon’t miss your chance to experience *MJ the Musical* in London. Beat it to the Prince Edward Theatre and book *MJ* West End tickets on Box Office.","salesMessage":"Dive into the extraordinary life of Michael Jackson, featuring his legendary songs and stunning choreography that celebrate the artistry and spirit of a pop icon.","contentModelType":"productRetailerOverride","entryId":"6g0w1fwGHGYm2defWEPac9","updatedAt":"2024-10-08T15:24:21.152Z"}],"similarProducts":null,"salesMessage":"Dive into the extraordinary life of Michael Jackson, featuring his legendary songs and stunning choreography that celebrate the artistry and spirit of a pop icon.","slug":"mj-the-musical","contentModelType":"product","entryId":"3ZyMmWe0dF24WHre5IPW90","updatedAt":"2025-05-15T15:52:42.979Z"},"bannerType":"Basic Banner","headlineOverride":"MJ The Musical","label":"Exclusive Prices","descriptiveCopy":"Book tix now from £25 for this Olivier Award-winning spectacle.

Lithgow delivers a tour-de-force performance that captures Dahl's contradictions—childlike wonder about storytelling coexisting with virulent antisemitism. What's most unsettling is watching the ecosystem around him—publishers, loved ones—navigate between complicity and conscience. This isn't a play about one man's bigotry; it's about how systems enable and excuse it. Mark Rosenblatt's script refuses easy answers, leaving audiences to grapple with the uncomfortable question: what do we do when artistic brilliance and moral failure inhabit the same person? Essential theater that provokes rather than preaches, Giant holds up an unflinching mirror to our collective capacity for both art and hate.","verified":true,"showtimeDate":"2025-05-06","helpfulVotesCount":0,"author":{"_type":"ReviewAuthor","displayName":"Devita D","avatarUrl":"","followersCount":0,"reviewsCount":2}},{"_type":"Review","score":100,"fiveStarScore":5,"url":"https://www.show-score.com/uk/london/west-end-shows/giant-west-end?utm_campaign=giant-west-end\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=ss#%23trusted_review_810912","adjectives":"Clever, Great acting","comment":"Truly great acting- well written.

Trevor Dion Nicholas was perfectly cast as Hades, his large presence and booming voice were very believable for the role. The iconic swinging lights in wait for me get me every time, really highlighting the stand-out moment in the show. The whole set design really adds to the production, the set splitting as well descend to the underworld and see essentially the factory that Hades is running lives in my head rent free. The storyline is complex, but most people will understand what is happening on the first watch. The songs aren’t my favourite, especially those sung by Orpheus, but Dylan Wood brought more life and emotion to the role.","verified":false,"showtimeDate":"2024-12-17","helpfulVotesCount":1,"author":{"_type":"ReviewAuthor","displayName":"Katie 606060","avatarUrl":"https://d4ov6iqsvotvt.cloudfront.net/uploads/user/avatar/626754/thumb_1734793225-IMG_1452.jpg","followersCount":12,"reviewsCount":213}}]},"rewards":null,"salesMessage":"The 8-time Tony Award-winning musical continues to thrill West End audiences.

Do not see it if: you aren't a fan of Stephen Schwartz. to go with an old cliche, Wicked is one of those shows that I don't feel will ever suffer from being \"unpopular\", even 20 years after its first premiere it feels as fun, entertaining and heartfelt as it ever has, and I feel the story resonates with a lot of people, especially anyone who has ever felt misunderstood, or like an outcast at any point. Fans of the original L. Frank Baum novel (and subsequently the 1939 film) will know the story like the back of their hands, but what Wicked does nicely is shift one's perspective on one of the most \"villainous\" characters from literature and cinema, both humanising her and even empathising with her strongly. The London production is simply spectacular, as is the case with any iteration of this modern classic, sure it will never be a profound narrative masterpiece, but musical theatre doesn't have to be, and for what it is, it's absolutely wonderful, and definitely worth a visit if you can.","verified":false,"showtimeDate":null,"helpfulVotesCount":2,"author":{"_type":"ReviewAuthor","displayName":"James Tradgett","avatarUrl":"https://d4ov6iqsvotvt.cloudfront.net/uploads/user/avatar/587256/thumb_1737251098-IMG_6300.jpg","followersCount":6,"reviewsCount":99}},{"_type":"Review","score":80,"fiveStarScore":4,"url":"https://www.show-score.com/uk/london/west-end-shows/wicked-london?utm_campaign=wicked-london\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=ss#%23trusted_review_146493","adjectives":"Entertaining, Great singing, Great staging","comment":"See it if: if you are a fan of The Wizard of Oz or interesting unpacking of fairy tales.
