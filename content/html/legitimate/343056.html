</o:p>The Arthur Jones/Nautilus Story</font><!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099"><font size="5">(Update: New book by Dr. Ellington Darden with the latest on Arthur 
Jones and HIT )</font> <!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Asked to describe Arthur Jones in a recent interview, I
said, A sort of angry genius. To say that Arthur is an unforgettable
character would be an understatement.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I attended the 1970 Mr. America contest in Culver City, CA,
where Arthur unveiled the prototype to what came to be Nautilus machines; he
called it The Blue Monster. I read his articles in Peary Raders <b><i>Ironman
</i></b>starting<b><i> </i></b>in 1971, and his <b><i>Nautilus Bulletins No. 1
and 2</i></b> published about the same time. Carol and I spent about 12 hours,
over two days, with Arthur at his home base in Deland, FL, in 1973. When we
landed, he was waiting for us on the landing strip in his 6-passenger airplane; 
we deplaned from our commercial flight, walked a few steps, and climbed into his 
private plane. We were impressed! It may have been the most intense two days of our lives.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I briefly toyed with the idea of going to work for Arthur,
having just left the law firm where I had spent ten years working my way up to
partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I wanted to be on my own 
and have more freedom to pursue my passion for fitness. Peary Rader suggested 
that I go down and talk to Arthur, who he described as the most innovative and 
fast-rising force in fitness. (How right he was! Arthur and his Nautilus
machines revolutionized sports training and the health club industry. Szimanski
writes<b>:</b> They literally owned the conditioning business from
approximately 1974 through 1982.)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wasting no time getting the play on his side, Arthur told
me early in the visit that he was to the right of Attila the Hun and hated
communists, but agreed with them on one thing<b>:</b> when they take over a
town, as the first order of business, they kill all the lawyers. He said he had
no need for my legal talent, that he considered lawyers parasites. Moreover, he said hed have to train me from the ground up, because Id have to
unlearn everything I thought I knew about weight training. Like all of
Arthurs employees, my job would be to do whatever is necessary.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After about two hours, Carol and I decided that didnt
sound like a very promising work environment. We thanked Arthur; told him we
didnt want to take up any more of his time, and that we were going home. He
seemed to accept that okay, saying we were making a hasty but possibly
correct decision. But then he went into overdrive, spending the rest of the
time telling us of his mental power. Among many other things, he told us his
I.Q. was beyond measure, on par with the Wright brothers and Albert Einstein. He
succeeded in convincing us that he is unusually smart--we bought one of the
first Nautilus Hip &amp; Back Machines, still have it--but in the course of
doing so reinforced our opinion that I wouldnt be a good fit for his
operation. It was an intense and fascinating encounter, one well never
forget.

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Arthur Jones' motto: <i>Younger Women, 
Faster Airplanes, Bigger Crocodiles</i>.&nbsp; </b>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was happy to learn that my friend John Szimanski (the
king of fractional plates) has published an authorized biography of Arthur Jones<b>:</b>
<b><i>Younger Women, Faster Airplanes, Bigger Crocodiles</i></b>. I was eager to
read his book and learn more about Arthur. I was not disappointed. True to his
engineering background, Szimanski provides a no-nonsense 157-page summary of
Arthurs many-faceted life. Some of the many twists and turns overlap and are
hard to follow. Nevertheless, its a riveting saga and a good read for anyone
interested in perhaps the most colorful in a long history of colorful
fitness-industry characters.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John Szimanski clearly likes and respects Arthur, who now
lives in Florida in semi-retirement. John appears to be a true believer.
He accepts the Nautilus training principles as close to the gospel truth. Still,
he tries hard to verify everything Arthur has said or written, through other
sources, all meticulously footnoted.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To whet your appetite, Ill tick off some of the
interesting facts John uncovers about Arthur and Nautilus, and then give you my
take on a few of Arthurs ideas on training. (Arthur would love being
second-guessed by his long-ago visitor! That is, if he could be bothered to read it--not 
likely.)

</o:p></span>Arthur Jones Factoids<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Arthurs father, mother, grandfather, and great
grandfather were all physicians. His half sister and half brother also became
doctors. The reason I never went to medical school along with my siblings,
Arthur told Szimanski, [was that] I was not inclined to work 24 hours a
day. As it turned out, Arthur only worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week,
according to Szimanski.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[Arthur] says he read his fathers entire medical
library at least twice before he was 12 and every book in the Seminole
[Oklahoma] library before he was 14, Szimanski writes.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Chief of Police in Seminole issued Arthur a permit to
carry a concealed weapon when he was in his early teens. I know you have a
pistol, he told Arthur. I know you need it; in the likely event you have to
use it, it will be better all around if it is legal.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Arthur dropped out of school in the tenth grade and was
penniless when he left home. He went broke more times than he can count.
And eventually made the <b>Forbes Fortune</b> list of the 400 richest people.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Arthurs Nautilus revenues, rumored by the media to be as
high as $300 to $400 million, actually peaked in the mid-1980s at $50 to $70
million a year. Nautilus was a private company and the
actual numbers are confidential.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Inge Topperwein is Arthurs longest continually serving
employee. He hired her in Africa while filming elephant culling in 1966.
Asked what she did by Carol during our visit to Florida, she dutifully replied:
Whatever is necessary. Always a stabilizing factor, according to
Szimanski, Inge became Arthurs sixth wife in 1994. She continued working for
him.
</p>
<h2 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#330099"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>My Take on Arthurs Ideas<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>1:</b> The secret, if there is one, is HIGH-INTENSITY; and when
you are actually training with high-intensity, you dont need a large amount
of training, Arthur Jones wrote in connection with the famous Colorado
Experiment. (In that experiment, Casey Viator, training under Arthurs
guidance, gained an incredible 63.21 pounds of muscle in 28 days. Full details
are in the book.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I agree. Overload is the cornerstone of strength training.
But no one can--or should--train with maximum intensity all the time, no matter
how infrequent the workouts. Its not feasible. And its certainly not fun.
Varying the degree of stress in a periodization format is a much better strategy
for long-term progress; see article 8 in our Strength Training category and my books and DVDs.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2: </b>In summarizing Arthurs current thinking based on
frequent quotes and numerous personal and phone conversations, Szimanski writes<b>:</b>
<i>Special equipment </i>[beyond barbells and dumbbells]<i> is not required. </i>[Emphasis
mine] If you have access to the right equipment, you do have the opportunity to
be more effective, more efficient and safer. The most effective equipment
provides<b>:</b> Proper line of motion for the specific exercise (linear or
rotary); direct, balanced, full range and automatically variable resistance for
positive and negative work; pre-stretching; and unlimited speed of
movement. Nautilus machines of course, provide these features.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I agree that special equipment is not required. But I have
serious doubts about Arthurs notion of the most effective equipment. As
the owner of five Nautilus machines, I understand the advantages. (The pullover
machine is my favorite; I use it regularly.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nautilus machines are probably the best ever made. Arthur was/is truly a 
genius at conceptualizing and building--and promoting--strength-training 
machines. Nevertheless, in my opinion, free weights are generally better, at least for 
advanced trainers. (Machines may be better--safer--for beginners who dont feel 
comfortable using free weights or trainees with joint problems or injuries.)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Arthur included barbell squats in the routines used during
the Colorado Experiment and the West Point study (see below) for a very good reason<b>:</b>
The barbell squat is the best exercise there is for building overall body
strength and muscle mass. Add the dead lift, bench press, bent row, standing
press and curl, and you have a routine that will produce results as good--and
probably better--than any routine done on machines, and for far less expense.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why are free weights better? Because the balancing and
stabilizing they require activates more muscle mass and triggers more neuromotor
units than machines. The fact that machines do the balancing and stabilizing for
you is their main drawback. I could go on, but in my view, thats the simple
answer. Its up to each person to decide whats best for him or her. (See my
discussion of athletic-type strength training in <b><i>Challenge Yourself</i></b>.)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>3: </b>One more idea and then Ill stop<b>:</b> Arthur believes
that moving as quickly as possible from exercise to exercise will simultaneously
produce maximum strength <i>and</i> aerobic improvement. That was the main surprise
coming out of Project Total Conditioning at West Point in 1975. To quote
Captain James Peterson, who set up, ran and documented the project<b>: </b>The
study made it clear that high intensity [weight] training is the most efficient
conditioning method known that simultaneously develops high degrees of aerobic
and anaerobic conditioning. It offers increases in size and strength, as well as
cardiovascular improvement.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I believe that such results are possible, but only in a
controlled setting such as West Point. The sessions were brief and brutal,
Szimanski writes. Resting was not permitted. The subjects were rushed from
exercise to exercise in the minimum possible time.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Colonel Al Rushatz second in command in the Department of
Physical Education at the Academy, who joined in the training himself, told
Szimanski, he had never worked so hard himself and had never seen anyone
worked to the level the cadets achieved.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tell me, does that sound like a practical and sustainable
way to train? Hell no! As Arthur told Carol and me, his methods work best when
hes on hand to literally kick people in the rear if they let up.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Doing weights and aerobics separately in a periodization
format is a far better way to achieve <i>and maintain</i> total fitness. For more
details, see my book <b><i>Lean For Life</i></b>.

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><u><font size="4"><b><i>The New Bodybuilding 
for Old-School Results</i>, by Ellington Darden, Ph.D., Testosterone Publishing 
(2006)</b></font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">After graduating from Florida State University 
with a Ph.D. in Exercise Science in 1973, Ell Darden took a job with Arthur 
Jones and his Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries and has worked with Jones 
directly or indirectly ever since. <font size="4"><b><i>The New Bodybuilding for 
Old-School Results </i></b></font>is his 48th book on various aspects of 
high-intensity training--and it may be his best! It's safe to 
say that, except for Arthur himself, no one knows more about Arthur Jones and 
the application of his Nautilus training principles than Darden. His new book is 
a combination of well-written text, stories, interviews and wonderful photos, 
which keeps the reader turning the pages and wanting more. Darden writes on the 
front cover<b>:</b> &quot;Most trainees don't want that bloated, drug-induced look of 
a modern pro bodybuilder. They'd much rather have that chiseled, athletic look 
of the Golden-Age Mr. Americas--such as Steve Reeves, Boyer Coe, and Casey 
Viator.&quot; (That's true, isn't it?) Darden has &quot;taken those lost techniques of the 
masters--added today's science--and created the new bodybuilding for old-school 
results.&quot; It's a sound premise and Darden delivers a product you'll enjoy. (As 
always, take what you can use, and leave the rest. See above for my views on 
Arthur Jones and his ideas on training.)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">My favorite line in the whole book comes from 
Darden's interview of Boyer Coe, the 1969 AAU Mr. America and NABBA Mr. 
Universe--and the man who has won more national and world-level bodybuilding 
contests than any other person. When asked to name top bodybuilders 
before and after 1980, Boyer refers to those that understood <i>the secret
</i>and those that never seemed to figure it out. At the end of the 
interview, he reveals what it is<b>:</b><i> </i>&quot;The secret to 
bodybuilding, or anything in life worth accomplishing, is effort--PERSISTENT 
EFFORT.&quot;&nbsp;
