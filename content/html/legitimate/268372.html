<h1>The Leda Programming Language</h1>

<p> <b> Leda </b> is a multiparadigm programming language.
The idea of a multiparadigm language is to provide a framework in which
programmers can work in a variety of styles, freely intermixing constructs
from different paradigms.  The techniques supported by Leda include 
imparative programming, the object-oriented approach, logic programming, 
and functional programming.

<p>
A complete description of Leda can be found in the book, 
<cite>Multiparadigm Programming in Leda</cite>, 
published by <a href="http://aw.com/">Addison-Wesley</a> 1995.
Unfortunately, the book is now out of print, however, 
sample chapters from this book are available 
<A href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~budd/Books/leda/">on-line</A>;
these include 
an introduction to the Leda language and a formal description of
the Leda grammar.
