C. V.<br>
1960<br>
C. V. Alexander, 57-year-old salesman for the Jamison Bedding Co., of
Nashville, Tenn., was found dead in his room in the Howard Hotel around
11:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. Doctors at Paintsville Hospital said
after a post mortem examination that Alexander had died of natural
causes, apparently of a heart attack.&nbsp; Coroner Jim Trimble set the
time of death at 10:00 p.m. Tuesday night. Mrs. Boone Howard, owner of
the hotel, said Mr. Alexander, who lived at 410 Jarvis Lane,
Louisville, Ky., helped her with a crossword puzzle Tuesday
night.&nbsp; She said he retired to his room about 8:00 and said he was
going to listen to the Kentucky-Vanderbilt basketball game on
radio.&nbsp; Mrs. Howard said Alexander was a regular guest at the
hotel. Coroner Trimble would not comment on the theory that Alexander
had suffered a heart attack during the excitement of the tight-scoring
UK game. A maid at the hotel, Ms. Jennie Perkins, found the body when
she entered the room to clean it.&nbsp; She said the body was lying on
the floor and added that the bed had not been slept in.&nbsp; Alexander
was fully clothed. Alexander had traveled this section for the Jamison
Company for approximately ten years, according to a local
merchant.&nbsp; The body was taken to the Paintsville Funeral Home.

HOWE, Verlie (Price)<br>
1905-1960<br>
One of the cold evening of January 18, 1960, at 9:48 p.m., the Divine
Lord saw fit to take into His Bosom Mrs. Virlie Price Howe, age 54,
beloved daughter of Mrs. Maria Meek and the late Bert Price, after a
long and painful illness of three and one-half years and being bedfast
for two long and suffering years. Verlie was born at the mouth of
Buffalo on March 23, 1905, the first and only daughter of the marriage
of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Price.&nbsp; Her father died during her very early
infancy. After many happy years of living with her mother and her
stepfather, Oscar Meek, she chose to spend her life in marriage to Don
Howe on January 2, 1922. To this marriage were born two lovely
children, Marie Opal Howe, Crislip, born October 6, 1922, and who
preceded her in death August 20, 1951, and James Henry Howe, born May
18, 1926 and who died in infancy. She became a member of Monaville,
West Virginia, Freewill Baptist Church on November 7, 1948, serving her
Lord faithfully until the last and giving Him praise wherever she was.
Even unto the very end, she shouted the praises to the Lord and stated
to her mother and friends that she had no dread of the mysterious thing
called death. Survivors are her mother, Mrs. Maria Meek, at home; one
sister, Mrs. Russell Reneer, Port Clinton, Ohio; three brothers, Virgil
Meek, Clarence Meek and Authie Meek all of Paintsville; three nieces,
six nephews, three grand-nephews and a host of relatives and friends.
We wish to commend her soul unto the Almighty God. Paintsville Herald

JENKINS, Frank<br>
1882-1960 <br>
Oliver Jenkins, prominent Eastern Kentucky oil and gas operator, died
at his home at Paintsville, following a cerebral hemorrhage, Monday
morning, May 16. Born May 31, 1882, at Stoneboro, Pennsylvania, the son
of a coal miner, Albin Jenkins and his wife, Margaret Wetzel Jenkins,
Oliver Jenkins went to work at 16 as a printer for the Mercer
(Pennsylvania) Herald-Dispatch, graduated to manager of the H. A. Greer
&amp; Company department store at Stoneboro, and then at the turn of
the century migrated southward into Kentucky and into the infant oil
and gas business here. Joining his uncle, Ross Wetzel, in opening the
Wayne County, Kentucky, oil field, he found there his life&#8217;s
work.&nbsp; Outgrowing this apprenticeship, Oliver, in 1918, went out
on his own.&nbsp; With a string of tools, a sound knowledge of drilling
techniques and a strong love for his fellow man, he forged quickly to
the front as an operator and as a citizen.&nbsp; The drilling
organization he built became, if not the largest in the state,
certainly the most competent. A Kiwanian, Republican, and Mason, he
served for many years on the City Council of Paintsville, and for most
of his life was in the forefront of most civic projects. He was best
known, however, for his warmth and kindness, and the hand he kept
outstretched to everyone who needed his help. While associated with his
uncle in the Wayne County Field, Oliver Jenkins met and married, on
August 22, 1910, Miss Lennie Parigan, daughter of A. B. and Via Snow
Parigan of Mills Spring, Kentucky.&nbsp; To this union were born,
Howard Jenkins, who predeceased his father, and Phillip, Paintsville,
John Russell, Alliance Ohio, Elizabeth (Mrs. John LaCava), New Britain,
Conn.; and Margaret (Mrs. J. K. Wells), Paintsville, who survive
him.&nbsp; Also surviving him is a sister, Mrs. Minnie Runkle, Sandy
Lake, Pa. Mr. Jenkins was a member of the First Christian Church of
Paintsville. Funeral services were conducted at the First Christian
Church, at 3 p.m., Wednesday, May 18, under the direction of Rev.
Joseph Zavadsky, with Rev. John Pommert and Rev. Charles Perry
assisting. Interment was in the Richmond Cemetery. Paintsville Herald

LEE, Norman<br>
1960<br>
Two tragic auto accidents, two less serious highway accidents, a
break-in, and a tire erased the holiday spirit in Johnson County and
resulted in the death of two residents and injury to six others. Killed
in separate auto mishaps were Norman Lee, 48, West Van Lear, and Claude
Russell Preston, 17, Paintsville. Injured in the Lee accident which
occurred on Middle Creek in Floyd County, were Herbert Deskins, 48, and
Winfield Holbrook, 32, both of West Van Lear.&nbsp; Deskins, who
suffered a fractured jaw and head injuries, remains in St. Mary&#8217;s
Hospital in Huntington, while Holbrook, suffering head injuries is in
Paintsville Hospital. Hospitalized as a result of the accident in which
Preston was killed were Charles Roy Vencil, about 27, Paintsville, and
Joe Plummer, 17, also of Paintsville. Police gave the following account
of the Lee accident. Deskins was driving Lee, Holbrook and Bruce Phelps
home from work in the mines in Breathitt County when an auto driven by
Redford K. Barnett, 42, Martin, went out of control on rain-slickened
Route 114, about three miles west of Prestonsburg and crashed into the
Deskins vehicle. Barnett said he applied his breaks and swerved into
the path of the Deskins auto. The accident occurred at 4:30 p.m.,
Wednesday, Dec. 28. Preston was killed when the car in which he was
riding went out of control and smashed into a 1953 Pontiac driven by
Vencil.&nbsp; Driver of the other car was Plummer. The accident
occurred Thursday, Dec. 29, on U. S. 40 in Paintsville near the C. and
O. underpass. Preston died of a fractured skull at 8:30 a.m., December
30 in Paintsville Hospital. Plummer suffered cuts and mouth injuries
while Vencil was hospitalized with a dislocated hip and cuts.&nbsp; No
charges have been filed in the accident, which pushed Johnson County&#8217;s
highway death count for the year to eight, worst in the county&#8217;s
history. Another traffic mishap, occurring Dec. 29 five miles north of
Paintsville on U. S. 23, created a serious hazard for residents of that
area and forced state policemen to re-route traffic for several hours.
A giant trailer-tractor, carrying 6200 gallons of gasoline, turned over
after swerving to miss two vehicles which had stopped in the
road.&nbsp; Gasoline poured out of the truck, creating a tense
situation.&nbsp; The driver, Kermit Bullock, 37, of Louisa, escaped
without injury. An accident Friday evening resulted in the injury of
two Paintsville youngsters. Kay Blevins, 16, suffered a broken nose and
Earl Arnett, 22, was treated for a mild concussion after the car which
Arnett was driving was hit by a car driven by Marshall Wheeler, 42,
Dayton, Ohio. The accident occurred this side of the Oil Springs High
School, about eight miles north of Paintsville.&nbsp; Miss Blevins, a
student at Paintsville High School gave this account. She and Arnett
had just crossed the bridge this side of the high school traveling
toward Paintsville when Wheeler&#8217;s car traveling on the wrong side of
the road and going north, forced them off the road.&nbsp; The Arnett
car, struck on the left front side, left the road completely, and then
swerved back across the road, crashing into a cliff. State Trooper Jack
Music said Wheeler was charged with drunk driving.&nbsp; He was not
injured. Thieves broke into Van Lear High School Dec. 28 and stole 10
typewriters from the typing classroom.&nbsp; State Trooper Paul Fraim
said no attempt was made by the thieves to take anything else in the
building. Arson is suspected in the burning of a house on Drake.&nbsp;
The home, which burned Dec. 30, belonged to Charles Ross.&nbsp; No
charges have been filed, but Trooper Fralin said officials were
investigating the possibility of arson. Services for Norman Lee were
held Saturday at Mayo Methodist Church in Paintsville. The 48-year-old
miner had been president of United Mine Workers Local 9905 for the past
10 years before his death Wednesday. A resident of this county all his
life, he was the son of the late Ed Lee, Sr., and Minnie Spears
Lee.&nbsp; Survivors inclue his wife, Mrs. Dess Bowling Lee, one son,
Norman Lee, Jr., at home, two daughters, Mrs. Betty Ruth Blair, West
Van Lear, and Mrs. Norma Jean Wells, Hawaii, and three sisters, Mrs.
Gladys Hazelett, Hager Hill, Mrs. Mary Belvins, Wittensville, and Mrs.
Pauline Salyers, Paintsville. Burial was in the Highland Memorial Park
Cemetery, Rev. Moses Kitchen and Rev. Charles Perry officiated.&nbsp;
Graveside rites were held by local union 9905. Claude Preston, a member
of the Paintsville High basketball team, was buried Sunday at Meally in
the family cemetery.&nbsp; The well-liked junior died at 8:30 a.m.,
Dec. 30 from injuries sustained in an auto accident on Thursday. He was
the son of Edgar Preston and the late Norma Fletcher Preston and the
stepson of Gussie Burgess Preston, Paintsville.&nbsp; Survivors

Redford K. Barnett, 42, Martin, went out of control on rain-slickened
Route 114, about three miles west of Prestonsburg and crashed into the
Deskins vehicle. Barnett said he applied his breaks and swerved into
the path of the Deskins auto. The accident occurred at 4:30 p.m.,
Wednesday, Dec. 28. Preston was killed when the car in which he was
riding went out of control and smashed into a 1953 Pontiac driven by
Vencil.&nbsp; Driver of the other car was Plummer. The accident
occurred Thursday, Dec. 29, on U. S. 40 in Paintsville near the C. and
O. underpass. Preston died of a fractured skull at 8:30 a.m., December
30 in Paintsville Hospital. Plummer suffered cuts and mouth injuries
while Vencil was hospitalized with a dislocated hip and cuts.&nbsp; No
charges have been filed in the accident, which pushed Johnson County&#8217;s
highway death count for the year to eight, worst in the county&#8217;s
history. Another traffic mishap, occurring Dec. 29 five miles north of
Paintsville on U. S. 23, created a serious hazard for residents of that
area and forced state policemen to re-route traffic for several hours.
A giant trailer-tractor, carrying 6200 gallons of gasoline, turned over
after swerving to miss two vehicles which had stopped in the
road.&nbsp; Gasoline poured out of the truck, creating a tense
situation.&nbsp; The driver, Kermit Bullock, 37, of Louisa, escaped
without injury. An accident Friday evening resulted in the injury of
two Paintsville youngsters. Kay Blevins, 16, suffered a broken nose and
Earl Arnett, 22, was treated for a mild concussion after the car which
Arnett was driving was hit by a car driven by Marshall Wheeler, 42,
Dayton, Ohio. The accident occurred this side of the Oil Springs High
School, about eight miles north of Paintsville.&nbsp; Miss Blevins, a
student at Paintsville High School gave this account. She and Arnett
had just crossed the bridge this side of the high school traveling
toward Paintsville when Wheeler&#8217;s car traveling on the wrong side of
the road and going north, forced them off the road.&nbsp; The Arnett
car, struck on the left front side, left the road completely, and then
swerved back across the road, crashing into a cliff. State Trooper Jack
Music said Wheeler was charged with drunk driving.&nbsp; He was not
injured. Thieves broke into Van Lear High School Dec. 28 and stole 10
typewriters from the typing classroom.&nbsp; State Trooper Paul Fraim
said no attempt was made by the thieves to take anything else in the
building. Arson is suspected in the burning of a house on Drake.&nbsp;
The home, which burned Dec. 30, belonged to Charles Ross.&nbsp; No
charges have been filed, but Trooper Fralin said officials were
investigating the possibility of arson. Services for Norman Lee were
held Saturday at Mayo Methodist Church in Paintsville. The 48-year-old
miner had been president of United Mine Workers Local 9905 for the past
10 years before his death Wednesday. A resident of this county all his
life, he was the son of the late Ed Lee, Sr., and Minnie Spears
Lee.&nbsp; Survivors inclue his wife, Mrs. Dess Bowling Lee, one son,
Norman Lee, Jr., at home, two daughters, Mrs. Betty Ruth Blair, West
Van Lear, and Mrs. Norma Jean Wells, Hawaii, and three sisters, Mrs.
Gladys Hazelett, Hager Hill, Mrs. Mary Belvins, Wittensville, and Mrs.
Pauline Salyers, Paintsville. Burial was in the Highland Memorial Park
Cemetery, Rev. Moses Kitchen and Rev. Charles Perry officiated.&nbsp;
Graveside rites were held by local union 9905. Claude Preston, a member
of the Paintsville High basketball team, was buried Sunday at Meally in
the family cemetery.&nbsp; The well-liked junior died at 8:30 a.m.,
Dec. 30 from injuries sustained in an auto accident on Thursday. He was
the son of Edgar Preston and the late Norma Fletcher Preston and the
stepson of Gussie Burgess Preston, Paintsville.&nbsp; Survivors
included three sisters, Mrs. Rebecca Wells, Boons Camp, Mrs. Doris
Davis, Mrs. Joyce Preston, both of Dayton, O., and four brothers,
Escom, Marvin, Billy Joe, and Edgar, Jr., all of Dayton, O. Services
were held in the Meally Church of Christ with the Rev. J. H. Short
officiating. Paintsville Herald 4 January 1961<br>
