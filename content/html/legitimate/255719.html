      The goal of the MIT Safety Project is to develop
      a theoretical foundation for safety and a methodology for building
      safety-critical systems built upon that foundation.  The methology
      includes special management structures and procedures, system hazard
      analysis, software hazard analysis, requirements modeling and 
      analysis for completeness and safety, design for safety, design 
      of human-machine interaction, verification (both testing
      and code analysis), operational feedback, and change analysis.
      In <A href = "book.html"> <i>Safeware: System Safety and
      Computers</i></a>, Nancy Leveson summarizes the issues involved and
      lays the foundation for building safer software-intensive systems. 
      A second book is in preparation that will introduce a new approach 
      to system safety.<p>

      A company, <a href="http://www.safeware-eng.com/"> Safeware 
      Engineering Corporation</a> has been established to transfer the
      research ideas to industrial practice and commercial tools. <p>
