MacNosy - A global procedural Disassembler
</B></H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<B>MacNosy</B>
is a program that will disassemble the Macintosh ROM or any 68K
or PowerPC code in a Macintosh resource file and produce a procedural
representation of  what it is disassembling along with cross reference maps
of the procedures, Macintosh Trap names, Macintosh Low Memory Globals, etc.
<BR>
It uses global flow analysis to subdivide the program into a set of
<BR>procedures and referenced data blocks.
<P>
<H1>
MacNosy can be used:
</H1>
As an educational aid to learn 68K or PowerPC assembly language.
<P>
To learn about the innards of the Macintosh OS.
<P>
To obtain detailed assembly listings and cross reference maps of a program.
<P>
To learn programming techniques used by other programmers.
<P>
As an adjunct to the Jasik Debugger to produce symbolic 'map' files
<BR>(called 'snit' or 'snt' = Saved Nosy Tables files) so that ANY program
<BR>can be debugged symbolically.
<BR>
This capability is presently used by my Debugger to give you symbol
<BR>information when you are executing System code on 68K or PPC Macs.
<P>
In addition to the above, Nosy will also let one annotate procedures
<BR>with comments and 'enhance' the disassembly, etc.
<P>
As Nosy and 'The Debugger' use a common disassembler, one should
<BR>look at the <A HREF="sourceandassembly.html">disassemblies</A>
in the Debugger features section.
