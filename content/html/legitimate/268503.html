As far as I know, this is the only 
information on the S1500 Unix servers that is available online. These pages
are still under construction; I intend to add more information soon !
<p>
TI's 1500 series was a relatively successful range of 68020/030/040-based
multi- and singleprocessor systems that ran TI System V, an AT&T SVR3.2
derivate. All 1500's are based on TI's NuBus bus system that is also used
on the Apple Macintosh II series and NeXT systems (both 680x0-based).
<p>
On the left you see a picture of the typical 1500 system unit. Disks and 
other peripherals are put in external cases.

I'd also like to provide information on the TI Explorer LISP system. The 
Explorer is relatively closely related to the 1500 systems and I have a set of 
Explorer boards sitting in a corner :-)
<P>
If you have any information, programs etc. to contribute, please upload to 
ftp.unix-ag.uni-siegen.de in /incoming and drop me a note.

If anyone wants me to provide information on TI's S990 systems, please
