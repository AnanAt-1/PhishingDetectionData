THE  LIFE  OF  A  SOLDIER. 


CHAPTER  I. 

General  view  of  Canada — Its  Wild  and  Civilized  Regions — 
Author's  position  there  with  the  Commander-in-Chief —

THE  mention  of  Canada,  the  most  important 
of  the  colonies  of  Great  Britain,  immediately 
revives  in  the  minds  of  those  who  know  this 
valuable  possession,  the  recollection  of  a  great 
extent  of  country,  watered  by  mighty  rivers, 
garnished  with  great  lakes  and  magnificent 
cataracts,  vast  forests  covering  the  virgin  soil, 
and  in  various  portions  rendered  picturesque 
by  ranges  and  groups  of  lofty  mountains.  In 
the  remote  parts  of  Canada,  the  country  is

still  left  to  the  Indian,  the  red-man  with  his 
leather  hunting  shirt,  leggings  and  mocassins, 
his  conical  bark  lodge  or  wigwam,  and  the  light 
canoe.  With  these  children  of  nature,  the 
bear,  the  great  moose  deer,  and  the  karibou 
may  be  hunted,  and  the  salmon,  bass  and 
white-fish  caught,  and  all  the  adventure  and 
romance  of  the  woods  and  wilds  may  be 
enjoyed.  Whereas  along  the  line  of  the  great 
St.  Lawrence  and  some  of  its  tributaries,  the 
settlements  are  cutting  deep  into  the  forests, 
and  fields  of  corn  wave  over  the  river  vallies, 
steamers  force  their  way  against  the  rapid 
current,  and  on  the  banks  rise  pleasant  dwell- 
ings and  large  stirring  commercial  cities. 

A  few  of  our  statesmen  have  visited  Canada, 
alas  !  too  few.  I  saw  the  Earl  of  Carlisle  there, 
also  the  Earl  of  Ellesmere  and  Lord  Stanley. 
If  the  country  were  better  known  by  those  who 
sit  in  high  places,  it  would  be  more  appreciated. 
It  is  very  desirable  that  it  should  remain 
attached  to  Great  Britain,  as  much  so  as 
Scotland  and  Ireland,  and  if  the  citizens  of 
Canada  were  looked  on  in  exactly  the  same  light 
at  home  as  Yorkshiremen  or  Welch  men,  and 
if  from  Canada  and  all  our  other  colonies,

\vhich  may  wish  it,  representatives  could  be 
sent  to  the  Imperial  Parliament,  the  stability  of 
the  vast  colonial  empire  of  Great  Britain  might 
be  materially  strengthened  and  perpetuated. 

Objections  might  be  raised  to  this,  but  they 
could  be  met  and  answered.  Having  lived 
many  years  in  colonies,  I  know  their  value  and 
something  of  the  feelings  of  the  people.  Of 
European  descent,  whether  British,  French  or 
Dutch,  they  are  entitled  to  European  con- 
sideration. 

In  the  beginning  of  1848, 1  was  on  the  staff 
of  a  highly  distinguished  officer,  and  most 
faithful  servant  of  the  public,  the  late  Lieut.- 
General  Sir  Benjamin  D'Urban,  G.C.B.,  and 
commander-in-chief  of  the  forces  in  British 
North  America,  with  whom  I  had  previously 
served  at  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope.  His  Ex- 
cellency, after  his  long  and  honourable  career, 
now  preferred  quiet  and  retirement,  and  instead 
of  living  in  Montreal,  kept  house  forty  miles 
below  the  city,  at  the  village  of  Sorel,  where 
he  had  a  government  country-house,  park  and 
garden. 

Sorel  is  at  the  mouth  of  the  Richelieu 
River,  which  here  empties  itself  into  the  St.

Lawrence  from  the  south.  The  village  is 
composed  of  brick  and  wooden  houses,  scattered 
along  straight  and  wide  streets,  a  square  is  in 
the  centre,  dark  forests  of  pine  are  close  at 
hand.  The  inhabitants  are  chiefly  French 
Canadians,  connected  with  the  river  navigation, 
and  the  place  used  to  be  enlivened  with  the 
presence  of  a  detachment  of  soldiers,  who 
occupied  pallisaded  barracks  commanding  the 
channel  of  the  St.  Lawrence.  Sorel  is 
healthy,  and  is  also  convenient  for  reaching 
Montreal  or  Quebec. 

The  spring  and  fall  are  pleasant  at  Sorel,  and 
may  be  enjoyed  with  the  assistance  of  a  boat, 
and  making  excursions  in  various  directions; 
but  the  summers  are  hot  as  at  other  places  in 
Canada,  (except  towards  the  mouth  of  the  St. 
Lawrence),  whilst  in  winter,  we  had  for  months 
dry,  cold  and  clear  weather,  and  the  usual 
sleigh  driving  and  snow-shoeing  on  the  light 
and  broad  raquette. 

In  1849,  the  Earl  of  Elgin  was  Governor 
General  of  British  North  America,  he  had 
lately  administered  the  government  of  Jamaica. 
Lord  Elgin  is  well  known  as  a  public  officer  of 
great  ability,  close  attention  to  business,  and  of 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  5 

great  oratorical  powers.  His  Excellency  resided 
at  Monklands,  three  miles  from  Montreal. 
Some  of  the  ministers  at  this  time  had  been 
disaffected  to  the  British  authorities,  during  the 
rebellions  of  1837-38,  and  though  there  had 
been  great  political  excitement,  yet  the  wheels 
of  government  worked  with  tolerable  smooth- 
ness till  the  spring  of  1849,  when  the  following 
serious  occurrences  took  place. 

The  season  was  an  open  one,  the  St. 
Lawrence  was  early  free  of  ice,  and,  owing  to 
the  unexpected  arrival  of  vessels  with  merchan- 
dize at  the  port  of  Quebec,  it  was  deemed 
advisable  that  his  Lordship  should  proceed, 
on  a  short  notice,  to  parliament  on  the  26th 
of  April,  to  give  the  royal  assent  to  a 
Customs'  Bill,  which  had  that  day  passed  the 
Legislative  Council.  Lord  Elgin  deemed  it 
expedient,  at  the  same  time,  to  dispose  of  the 
other  acts,  in  which  the  two  branches  of  the 
local  parliament,  had,  at  an  earlier  period  of  the 
session,  concurred,  and  which  still  awaited  his 
decision ;  among  these  was  the  act  to  provide 
for  the  indemnification  of  parties  in  Lower 
Canada,  whose  property  was  destroyed  during 
the  rebellions  of  1837-38,  with  respect  to  which

much  excitement  had  been  excited  in  and  out 
of  parliament. 

Many  persons  had  disapproved  of  the  mea- 
sures respecting  rebellion  losses  in  Lower 
Canada,  which  had  been  introduced  by  the 
government,  and  which  the  local  parliament  had 
passed  by  large  majorities ;  and,  in  the  ininds 
of  others,  to  use  the  language  of  a  despatch, 
"  It  stirred  national  antipathies,  which  designing 
politicians  sought  to  improve  for  their  own 
selfish  ends." 

The  British  party  in  Lower  Canada,  who  had 
turned  out  most  loyally  and  gallantly  in  the 
rebellion,  eould  not  brook  that  those  who  had 
pursued  an  opposite  course  should  now  entertain 
the  idea,  that  their  losses,  during  the  rebellion* 
should  be  made  good,  and  that  a  tax  should  be 
imposed  for  this  purpose. 

The  British  party  imagined,  that,  by  the 
Indemnity  Bill,  all  indiscriminately  who  had 
suffered  loss  during  the  rebellion  would  be 
indemnified,  whether  they  had  turned  out 
against  the  government  or  not;  while  it  was 
alleged  by  the  opposite  party,  that,  after  due 
inquiry,  only  those  who  had  incurred  losses  by 
no  fault  of  their  own  should  be  indemnified* 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  7 

The  parliament  was  denounced  as  French  in 
its  composition,  and  the  government  as  subject 
to  French  influence;  and  doctrines  had  been 
broached  with  respect  to  the  right  which  belongs 
to  a  British  minority,  of  redressing,  by  violence, 
any  indignity  to  which  it  might  be  subject  from 
such  a  source. 

When  Lord  Elgin  left  the  Parliament  House, 
after  giving  the  Royal  Assent  to  the  bills  above 
alluded  to,  among  others  the  Rebellion  Losses 
Indemnity  Bill,  as  he  entered  his  carriage 
(which  was  escorted  by  provincial  cavalry)  he 
was  received  by  a  crowd  with  hootings  and 
groans,  whilst  a  knot  of  individuals,  respectably 
dressed,  pelted  the  carriage  with  various  missiles 
collected  at  the  spot. 

The  Houses  of  Parliament  were  under  one 
roof,  the  building  was  formerly  the  St.  Anne's 
Market,  which  had  been  fitted  up  for  legislative 
purposes  after  the  seat  of  government,  which 
had  been  at  Kingston,  was  removed  to  Montreal. 
Besides  two  spacious  halls,  for  the  Legislative  v' 
Council  and  the  Legislative  Assembly,  well 
furnished,  and  ornamented  with  handsome 
pictures  of  her  Majesty,  there  were  valuable 
libraries  belonging  to  the  above  two  bodies, 


8  PASSAGES   IN 

and  archives  and  records  of  the  United  Pro- 
vinces. 

Notwithstanding  the  great  excitement  which 
prevailed  outside  the  Parliament  House,  after  the 
Governor-General  had  retired,  the  house  con- 
tinued in  Session,  and,  apparently,  in  perfect 
confidence,  although  Sir  Allan  Macnab  had 
warned  the  party  of  the  ministers,  that  it  would 
be  advisable  to  call  for  military  assistance,  as  the 
populace  were  understood  to  be  in  a  state  of 
ferment,  and  a  riot  might  be  expected. 

It  soon  became  known  that  a  public  meeting 
had  been  called;  a  caleche  passed  with  a 
bell,  and  a  person  announcing  the  meeting 
to  take  place  in  the  Champ-de-Mars,  at 
eight  o'clock,  was  heard  from  the  house;  the 
fire-bells  were  also  rung  in  the  city  to  create 
excitement. 

Accordingly,  at  the  Champ-de-Mars,  a  large 
number  of  persons  assembled;  the  sloping 
bank  and  the  stone  steps  there  were  crowded 
with  persons,  many  of  whom  bore  torches. 
Some  inflammatory  speeches  were  made  on  the 
occasion,  with  reference  to  the  Rebellion  Losses 
Bill,  &amp;c.,  and  suddenly  there  was  a  cry,  "  To  the 
Parliament  House  1" 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  9 

The  crowd  immediately  organized  themselves 
hastily  into  a  sort  of  procession,  and  then  ran 
down,  in  an  excited  state,  to  the  Parliament 
buildings.  It  was  nine  o'clock,  and  the  House 
of  Assembly  was  engaged  in  discussing  the 
Judicature  Bill  for  Lower  Canada ;  there  was 
neither  police  nor  military  in  the  way,  when 
a  loud  shout,  mingled  with  yellings,  gave  the 
members  unmistakable  evidence  that  a  riot  was 
fermenting  outside,  and  immediately  after  a 
number  of  stones  were  driven  through  the 
windows.  The  strangers'  gallery  was  immediately 
deserted,  some  of  the  members  escaped  by  it, 
and  others  took  refuge  behind  the  Speaker's 
chair,  whilst  the  stones  continued  to  be  thrown 
incessantly. 

The  missiles  came,  at  first,  from  the  front  of 
the  building,  but  presently  they  came  from  the 
back  also,  till  very  little  glass  was  left  in  the 
windows.  There  was  a  short  cessation  in  the 
attack,  and  several  of  the  members  again 
entered  the  House  from  the  lobbies  ;  but  the 
stones  were  again  thrown,  and  fell  in  the  centre 
of  the  hall,  through  the  shattered  windows ; 
then  a  cry  was  raised  from  the  library  end  of 
the  building — "  They  come  !"  and  the  members 


10  PASSAGES    IN 

and  clerks  there,  rushing  across  the  hall,  dis- 
appeared at  the  opposite  end. 

A  dozen  persons  now  entered  the  Hall  of 
Assembly  from  the  library  end,  armed  with 
sticks;  one  of  them,  a  man  with  a  broken 
nose,  walked  up  the  steps,  and  seating  himself 
in  the  Speaker's  chair,  said,  in  Cromwellian 
style,  and  waving  his  hand,  "  I  dissolve  this 
House !"  The  others  then  commenced  the 
work  of  destruction :  the  papers  were  struck  off 
the  members'  desks  into  the  middle  of  the 
floor  with  sticks;  some  tore  up  the  benches, 
and  hurled  them  also  into  the  middle  of  the 
floor,  whilst  others  threw  their  sticks  at  the 
chandeliers  and  globe-lights  on  the  walls,  and 
demolished  them. 

The  splendid  mace,  silver-gilt,  and  orna- 
mented with  the  Imperial  crown  and  Canadian 
beavers,  lay  under  the  table,  as  the  House  was 
in  Committee ;  but  one  of  the  rioters  seeing 
it,  he  seized  it  up,  and  carried  it  off  on  his 
shoulders,  when  the  Sergeant-at-arms,  whose 
province  it  was  to  guard  the  mace,  rushed 
upon  the  man  who  bore  it,  and  endeavoured 
to  rescue  it ;  but  he  was  overpowered  by  others, 
and  the  mace  was  borne  into  the  street. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  11 

The  Honourable  William  Robinson,  M.P.P., 
and  Colonel  Gugy,  M.P.P.,  exerted  themselves 
to  expel  the  rioters  from  the  House.  Sir  Allan 
Macnab  assisted  to  save  the  Queen's  picture ; 
when  suddenly  a  red  glare  of  light  from  below 
showed  that  the  building  had  caught  fire.  It 
is  not  believed  that  the  rioters  had  any  inten- 
tion, originally,  to  fire  the  Parliament  House  ; 
they  certainly  wished  to  testify  their  indignation 
by  pelting  and  hooting  those  who  had  been 
instrumental  in  passing  the  obnoxious  Rebel- 
lion Loss  Bill,  but  meeting  with  little  or  no 
opposition  in  the  work  of  destruction,  and 
heated  with  passion,  they  probably  broke  the 
gas-pipes,  and  thus  the  fire  rapidly  spread  to  all 
parts  of  the  building. 

Sir  Allan  Macnab,  the  Honourable  Mr. 
Badgeley,  Mr.  Turner,  editor  of  the  "  Courier," 
and  others,  tried  to  save  some  of  the  valuable 
books  in  the  library  of  the  Assembly  ;  the  other 
picture  of  the  Queen  in  the  Council-Chamber 
was  also  carried  out  by  Mr.  W.  Snaith,  Jun., 
and  Mr,  Hargrave — it  cost  £500,  and  was 
painted  by  Partridge,  and  for  a  time  disap- 
peared. 

But  now  the  flames  spread  so  rapidly  that 


12  PASSAGES    IN 

every  one  was  obliged  to  seek  safety  in  flight ; 
and  Sir  Allan,  Mr.  Badgeley,  Mr.  Steers,  and 
Mr.  Macfarlane  were  pursued  by  the  flames, 
were  scorched,  and  were  eventually  taken  off  a 
gallery  with  ladders. 

The  flames  now  enveloped  the  whole  of  the 
building,  and  the  military  having  been  sent  for, 
when  too  late,  could  only  keep  back  the  crowd, 
which  drew  up  on  the  footpath  to  view  the 
conflagration,  which  illuminated  the  whole  city, 
and  rolled  its  black  volumes  of  smoke  towards 
the  Montreal  mountain.  Some  fire-engines 
tried  to  play  on  the  building,  but  ineffectually  ; 
however,  they  saved  some  neighbouring  houses 
which  had  caught  fire — also  the  Grey  Nunnery. 
There  was  a  smart  breeze  blowing,  and  burning 
paper  in  great  quantities  was  carried  along  the 
ground  in  flakes  of  fire.  It  was  altogether  an 
imposing,  but  a  very  painful  sight,  chiefly  on 
account  of  the  destruction  of  the  two  valuable 
libraries,  and  a  large  portion  of  the  public 
records  of  the  province.  The  Pilot  Office, 
where  the  ministerial  paper  was  printed,  was 
visited  by  the  mob,  and  the  windows  de- 
molished ;  after  which,  for  that  evening,  the 
work  of  destruction  closed,  and  the  morning 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  13 

sun  looked  on  the  smoking  and  empty  walls  of 
the  late  Houses  of  Parliament. 

On  their  way  from  the  Parliament  building, 
the  mob  escorted  the  person  carrying  the  mace, 
in  a  caliche,  and  when  they  came  opposite 
Donegana's  Hotel,  where  Sir  Allan  Macnab 
lived,  a  cry  was  raised  that  the  mace  should 
be  left  in  his  keeping,  as  the  late  popular 
Speaker ;  but  a  struggle  taking  place  for  its 
possession,  some  of  the  beavers  were  broken  off. 
However,  the  mace  eventually  was  carried  into 
Sir  Allan's  room. 

I  happened  to  come  to  Montreal  from  Sorel, 
on  private  business,  at  this  time,  and  found  the 
city  in  a  ferment,  the  Parliament  Houses 
smoking,  arid  the  inhabitants  in  the  greatest 
state  of  agitation  and  excitement,  the  troops 
under  arms,  and  all  the  appearance  of  another 
rebellion. 

The  Commander-in-Chief  now  arrived  from 
Sorel,  accompanied  with  the  other  members  of 
his  Staff,*  and  made  arrangements  for  the 
suppression  of  riot  and  disorder ;  but  for  a 
whole  month  the  city  continued  in  a  ferment —

Virginius  Murray,  A.D.Cs. 


14  PASSAGES   IN 

so  roused  had  the  people  become — so  infuriated 
against  each  other  were  parties — the  British,  or 
the  old  Loyalists,  and  the  French,  or  Ministerial 
party. 

The  Government  now  made  several  arrests. 
Messrs.  Heward,  Montgomerie,  Mack,  Esdaile, 
and  Ferres  were  taken  into  custody,  and 
marched  off  to  gaol,  on  the  plea  that  they  had 
excited  and  headed  the  ribters  at  the  destruc- 
tion of  the  Parliament  House.  The  people 
threatened  to  rescue  them,  and  beat  and  in- 
sulted several  of  the  members  obnoxious  to 
them,  who  came  in  their  way — as  Mr.  Holmes, 
Mr.  Watts,  Mr.  H.  Boulton.  The  military 
were  drawn  across  the  street  at  the  old  Govern- 
ment House,  in  Notre-Dame  Street,  where  the 
ministers  were  sitting  in  council ;  and  the  mob 
continued  to  hoot  and  pelt  the  members  of  the 
ministry  and  their  supporters  who  attempted  to 
come  out  of  the  conclave  within.  The  soldiers 
every  now  and  then  cleared  the  ground,  by 
inarching  to  and  fro  with  fixed  bayonets,  and 
the  people  always  retired  before  them,  cheering 
and  laughing — as  there  was,  of  course,  no  ill- 
feeling  between  them  and  the  soldiers. 

At  night,   the   assemblage  in  front  of  the 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  15 

Government  House  became  more  dense;  sig- 
nals were  passed  among  the  crowd,  and  sud- 
denly, a  large  body  (which  I  followed  to 
ascertain  their  intention)  moved  off  towards  the 
St.  Antoine  suburb,  where,  attacking  the  resi- 
dence of  the  Prime  Minister,  Mr.  Lafontaine, 
the  stables  were  destroyed  by  fire,  and  the  house 
ransacked  inside ;  the  furniture  being  broken, 
feather-beds  emptied  to  the  wind,  books 
tumbled  from  their  shelves,  and  the  whole 
house  reduced  to  a  wreck.  Fortunately  for  the 
family,  they  escaped  before  the  rioters  arrived. 
The  mob  moved  so  swiftly  and  silently,  that 
the  military  did  not  reach  the  house  of  Mr. 
Lafontaine — who  omitted  to  have  a  guard 
there,  after  the  warning  he  had  had  by  the 
destruction  of  the  Parliament  House — till  the 
mischief  was  done. 

The  rioters  next  visited  Mr.  Drummond's 
house;  there  they  found  a  guard,  and  no 
damage  ensued.  At  Messrs.  Baldwin  and 
Cameron's  boarding-house,  the  windows  were 
broken ;  also  at  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson's  residence, 
and  at  the  houses  of  Messrs.  Hincks,  Holmes, 
and  Charles  Wilson. 

The  Executive  had  in  a  manner  left  the  city 


16  PASSAGES   IN 

for  two  days  in  the  hands  of  a  mob,  though  a 
powerful  military  force  only  waited  the  requisi- 
tion of  the  civil  authorities  to  turn  out  and 
maintain  the  supremacy  of  the  law ;  and  now, 
perhaps,  because  the  military  had  not  come  up 
in  time  to  prevent  the  unexpected  move  on  Mr. 
Lafontaine's  house,  the  singular  expedient  was 
resorted  to  of  arming  with  cutlasses  and  pistols 
young  French  Canadians,  Irishmen,  &amp;c.,  "for 
the  protection  of  lives  and  property."  If  the 
householders  had  been  asked,  they  would  im- 
mediately have  turned  out  as  special  constables, 
and  acted  with  the  two  strong  regiments  in 
garrison,  the  19th  and  23rd. 

The  drilling  of  the  armed  constables  during 
the  night  at  the  Bonsecours  Market,  occasioned 
an  immense  ferment  among  the  opposite  party. 
They  again  organized  themselves,  and  were 
marching  to  disarm  the  constables  by  force, 
when  they  were  met  by  Major-General  the 
Honourable  Charles  Gore,  and  Colonel  Gugy, 
who  harangued  them,  said  the  arming  was  a 
"  mistake,"  and  that  next  morning  one  part  of 
the  population  should  not  be  armed  against  the 
other.  The  mob  was  accordingly  pacified  and 
retired.  If  they  had  gone  on  there  would  have 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  17 

been  a  fearful  scene  of  bloodshed.  The  officers 
who  stopped  them  are  deserving  of  great 
credit. 

Another  riot  was  excited  by  the  arrival  from 
Quebec  of  a  deputation  to  offer  protection  to 
the  Governor-General ;  but  the  members  of  this 
deputation  learning  that  they  would  probably 
be  met  on  the  wharf  by  an  angry  mob,  prudently 
left  the  steamer,  and  landed  in  the  outskirts  of 
Montreal,  and  entered  the  city  in  the  evening, 
without  exciting  observation. 

The  loyal  inhabitants  of  the  city  now  held  a 
meeting,  and  put  forth  an  address,  signed  by  two 
hundred  respectable  names,  inviting  the  citizens 
to  preserve  peace  and  order.  This  had,  to  a  certain 
extent,  a  tranquillizing  effect ;  but  a  new  source 
of  uneasiness  arose  from  the  ministry  having 
arranged  to  get  up  an  address  of  confidence  in 
the  Governor-General,  and  deciding  that  his 
Excellency  should  receive  it  in  town,  instead  of 
at  his  official  country  residence  at  Monklands. 

Lord  Elgin,  accordingly,  drove  into  town  in 
his  carriage  and  four,  to  receive  the  address  at 
the  Old  Government  House.  His  Excellency 
was  accompanied  by  the  Honourable  Colonel 
Bruce,  his  brother  and  military  secretary,  Lord 

VOL.  i.  c 


18  PASSAGES   IN 

Mark  Kerr,  and  Lieutenant  Grant,  A.D.C. ; 
and  he  was  escorted  by  Captain  Jones  troop  of 
Provincial  Dragoons.  The  infantry  were  drawn 
up  opposite  Government  House.  As  his  Lord- 
ship entered  the  city,  he  was  assailed  by  a 
shower  of  stones  in  the  Haymarket  and  Great 
St.  James  Street,  thrown  by  some  stout  me- 
chanics in  fustian  jackets ;  and  again  as  he 
proceeded  along  Notre-DameStreet ;  he  was 
obliged  to  keep  his  hat  before  his  eyes  to 
guard  his  face  from  the  missiles,  and  entered 
Government  House,  carrying  with  him  a  two- 
pound  stone,  which  he  picked  up  from  the 
bottom  of  the  carriage — altogether  most  unusual 
treatment  for  her  Majesty's  representative  to 
receive,  and  very  painful  for  us  to  witness. 

There  was  a  great  and  angry  crowd  in  the 
streets,  and  expecting  his  Lordship's  return  by 
the  same  route  he  had  passed  along,  the  rioters 
had  made  preparations  for  obstructing  him, 
and  for  upsetting  his  carriage,  by  drawing  cabs 
across  the  street ;  but  in  accordance  with  the 
maxim  of  the  renowned  Rob  Roy,  "  never  to 
return  by  the  same  road  you  went,  if  you  expect 
any  trouble ;"  when  his  Lordship  re-entered  his 
carriage,  instead  of  turning  round,  he  directed 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  19 

the  carriage  to  proceed  straight  forward ;  and, 
doubling  on  the  mob,  he  passed  rapidly  along 
St.  Denis  and  Sherbrooke  Streets,  to  gain 
Monklands  by  a  circuitous  route. 

When  the  mob  perceived  this  clever  manoeuvre, 
they  were  much  exasperated ;  and,  rushing  on 
foot  and  in  cabs  by  bye-streets  to  intercept  the 
carriage  in  Sherbrooke  Street,  a  considerable 
number  came  up  in  time  to  assail  it  with  stones 
at  Molson's  Corner.  Colonel  Bruce's  head  was 
cut  and  bled,  Colonel  Ermatenger,  police  magis- 
trate, was  stunned,  also  Captain  Jones;  and 
every  panel  of  the  carriage  was  stove  in.  The 
escort  was  not  loaded ;  or  several  lives  would 
have  been  lost.  The  postillions,  as  the  rioters 
were  crowding  on  in  front,  turned  sharp  up  the 
the  Mile- end-road,  and,  by  good  and  rapid 
driving,  soon  cleared  the  excited  multitude. 
His  Lordship  reached  Monklands  in  safety, 
though  he  had  certainly  a  very  narrow  escape 
from  personal  injury.  The  exasperation  was  so 
great  against  him  for  signing  the  obnoxious 
Rebellion  Losses  Bill. 

About  this  time,  there  was  some  bloodshed, 
in  consequence  of  the  ministers  and  their  friends 
having  given  a  political  dinner  at  Tetus  Hotel 

c  2 


20  PASSAGES    IN 

to  a  deputation  from  their  party  in  Toronto. 
Toasts  were  given,  and  there  was  a  good  deal 
of  cheering.  This  was  answered  by  groans 
from  without.  A  crowd  had  collected,  and 
empty  bottles  having  been  imprudently  thrown 
out  at  them,  stones  were  returned,  and  an  at- 
tempt made  to  force  the  door,  which  was  resisted 
with  knives  and  pistol-shots.  Two  or  three  of 
the  mob  were  wounded,  and  the  house  ran  the 
risk  of  being  fired,  had  not  a  strong  party  of 
the  military  (horse  and  foot),  under  Colonel 
Hay  (commanding  19th  Regiment)  promptly 
arrived  and  quieted  the  disturbance. 

Mr.  Lafontaine's  house  was  again  attacked, 
but  this  time,  he  being  prepared  for  the  mob,  they 
were  received  with  a  volley  of  musketry  from 
the  windows,  which  taking  effect  fatally  on  a 
young  man  named  Mason,  the  rioters  dispersed. 
At  the  Coroner's  Inquest,  Mr.  Lafontaine  being 
present  to  give  evidence,  the  hotel,  where  it  was 
held,  was  set  on  fire  from  above ;  and  an  at- 
tempt was  made  to  do  violence  to  Mr,  Lafontaine 
in  the  confusion,  but  a  party  of  the  7 1st  High- 
landers saved  him. 

When  the  house  was  burning,  and  the  flames 
rushing  down  stairs,  two  sentries  of  the  71st 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  21 

moved  about  at  their  posts  in  the  house,  as  if 
there  was  nothing  the  matter,  all  the  rest  of  the 
people  had  fled.  A  gentleman  looking  back, 
and  seeing  the  soldiers,  called  to  them  to  come 
out  at  once.  They  coolly  answered,  "  We  have 
got  no  orders ;"  and  it  was  not  till  a  sergeant 
was  found  to  take  them  away  that  they  would 
leave  their  posts. 

I  had  occasion  to  be  much  out  about  this 
time,  a  great  part  of  one  night,  when  Colonel 
Tache,  commanding  the  armed  constables,  was 
drilling  them  by  lamplight,  and  marching  them 
to  and  fro  before  the  Bonsecours  market.  It 
was  difficult  to  persuade  him,  so  full  of  martial 
ardour  was  he,  that  it  was  better  to  house  them, 
armed  as  they  were  with  cutlass  and  pistol,  and 
keep  them  ready  for  action  in  the  market,  than 
to  provoke  an  attack  on  them  by  the  opposite 
party,  all  ready  for  a  fight  as  they  were.  I  saw 
the  attack  made,  and  people  wounded  at  Tetus 
Hotel,  and  then  had  a  long  hunt  to  recover  the 
large  pictures  of  her  Majesty  carried  off  from 
the  Parliament  House,  no  one  seemed  to  know 
where,  the  night  it  was  burnt.  I  found  them 
in  obscure  places  in  the  outskirts  of  the  city, 
and  it  was  gratifying  to  be  able  to  lodge  them 


22  PASSAGES   IN 

for  a  time  in  the  General's  sitting  room.  They 
were  afterwards  repaired ;  and  when  the  Par- 
liament held  its  sittings  in  a  new  building  of 
Mr.  Hayes  in  Dalhousie  Square,  they  were 
placed  on  the  walls,  and  things  were  beginning 
to  assume  an  air  of  comparative  tranquillity, 
after  a  month  of  intense  anxiety  and  excite- 
ment ;  and  then  occurred  the  closing  scene  of 
a  painful  drama. 

Sir  Benjamin  D'Urban,  with  the  officers  of 
his  staff,  lived  at  Donegana's  Hotel.  He  had 
much  to  harass  him,  and,  from  the  state  of  the 
weather,  in  May,  cold  and  variable,  he  was  un- 
able to  take  air  or  exercise  abroad.  He  had 
previously,  at  Sorel,  suffered  from  sore-throat ; 
and,  from  his  hard  service  in  various  climates, 
his  system  had  been  much  tried,  though  naturally 
with  a  fine  constitution.  He  was  a  remarkably 
well-made  and  soldier-like  man,  with  prominent 
features,  of  great  mental  energy,  a  high  order 
of  intellect,  and  of  chivalrous  courage. 

He  had  complained  for  several  days  "  of  not 
being  worth  much."  He  ate  very  little ;  but  we 
hoped,  that  when  all  was  quiet  at  Montreal, 
and  he  could  get  back  to  his  favourite  woods 
and  walks  at  Sorel,  all  would  be  well.  But  it 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  23 

was  otherwise  ordered  by  Divine  Providence, 
which  he  devoutly  feared,  and  nothing  else. 

The  shock  was  great  to  me,  as  an  old  and 
devoted  follower  of  his  Excellency,  when,  on  the 
morning  of  the  25th  May,  whilst  walking  before 
breakfast  along  St.  James'  Street,  a  cab  rapidly 
drove  up,  and  an  orderly  dragoon  in  it,  said :  "  Sir 
Benjamin  is  just  dead,  and  I  am  going  to  Monk- 
lands  to  Lord  Elgin  with  a  message."  Alas  !  it 
was  too  true  :  one  of  the  bravest  and  most  ac- 
complished British  officers  had  ceased  to  exist. 

Sir  Benjamin  had  risen  and  partly  dressed, 
and  was  found  by  his  son  Colonel  D'Urban, 
Deputy  Quarter-Master-General,  trying  to  write 
a  letter  in  his  sitting-room;  but  his  hand 
seemed  to  fail  him.  The  Colonel  asked  to  write 
to  his  dictation,  and  his  Excellency  dictated  a 
letter  on  public  business  to  Lord  Elgin  with 
remarkable  clearness,  then  retired  to  his  bed- 
room to  dress  for  the  day ;  but,  seized,  as  was 
supposed,  with  a  choking  in  the  throat,  he  sat 
down  by  the  side  of  the  bed  on  which  he  leant, 
and  was  found  by  his  servant  expiring.  Medical 
aid  was  summoned ;  but  the  world  had  closed 
upon  him  at  the  age  of  seventy-two,  and  he  died 
like  a  true  soldier,  at  his  post  of  duty.

By  his  desire,  I  had  got  him  some  volumes  of 
interesting  reading,  and  I  found  his  mark  where 
a  traveller  has  reached  the  verge  of  a  great 
extent  of  prairie,  with  an  undefined  horizon  ! 

Sir  Benjamin  D'Urban  had  received  a  cross 
and  five  clasps  for  Busaco,  Albuera,  Badajoz, 
Salamanca,  and  Vittoria,  Pyrenees,  Nivelle, 
Nive  and  Toulouse.  He  entered  the  army  in 
1793,  as  Cornet  in  the  2nd  Dragoon  Guards. 
In  the  following  year  obtained  a  troop,  and 
accompanied  Sir  Ralph  Abercrombie's  expedition 
to  the  West  Indies.  In  1803,  was  appointed 
Superintendant  of  Instruction  in  the  Military 
College  at  Marlow,  and  served  as  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  89th  regiment,  in  the  expedition  under 
Lord  Cathcart,  in  1805.  He  served  in  the 
Peninsula  and  France  from  the  autumn  of  1808 
to  the  end  of  the  war  in  1814,  and  was  never 
absent.  In  the  end  of  1808,  and  beginning  of 
1809,  having  been  then  in  the  Quarter-Master- 
General's  staff  of  the  forces  in  Portugal,  he  was 
employed  by  Quarter-Master-General  Cradock 
in  observation  of  the  French  corps  on  the 
frontiers  of  Castile  and  Estramadura.  In  the 
execution  of  this  duty,  he  was  with  Sir  Robert 
Wilson  in  his  operations  between  Ciudad 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  25 

Rodrigo  and  Salamanca,  and  afterwards  with 
the  Spanish  army  of  General  Cuesta,  upon  the 
Tagus  and  Guadiana,  and  at  the  battle  of 
Medelin.  He  was  then  selected  to  be  Quarter- 
Master-General  of  the  Portuguese  army,  of 
which  Marshal  Beresford  had  himself  taken  the 
command,  and  returning  to  Portugal  joined  it 
accordingly.  In  this  appointment,  he  continued 
to  serve  throughout  the  war,  occasionally  em- 
ployed, however,  in  charge  of  a  corps  of 
Portuguese  cavalry,  which  he  commanded  at 
Salamanca  and  Vittoria ;  in  the  other  actions, 
for  which  he  received  decorations,  he  was  in  the 
performance  of  his  duties  on  the  staff. 

Sir  Benjamin  was  Colonel  of  the  51st  King's 
own  Light  Infantry,  had  been  Colonel  of  the 
Royal  Staff  Corps,  and  administered  the  govern- 
ments of  Antigua,  British  Guiana  and  the  Cape 
of  Good  Hope,  at  which  last  he  conducted,  to  a 
successful  termination,  the  Caffre  war  of  1835, 
and  suggested  those  measures  for  the  restraint 
and  well  being  of  the  Caffres,  which,  at  first 
rejected,  have  since  been  wisely  adopted. 

His  military  funeral  took  place  on  the  28th 
of  May,  and  was  attended  by  10,000  spectators, 
and  an  obelisk  erected  to  his  memory  in  the

Victoria  Road  Cemetery,  Montreal,  by  the  officers 
serving  in  Canada,  records,  "  He  died  as  he  had 
lived,  in  the  faithful  discharge  of  his  duty  to 
God  and  his  Sovereign." 

The  Parliament  was  prorogued  by  Major- 
General  Rowan,  (now  Lieut-General  Sir  William 
Rowan,  K.C.B.)  a  Peninsular  and  Waterloo 
officer  of  high  character,  and  experienced  in 
Canadian  affairs,  from  having  been  military 
secretary  to  Sir  John  Colborne,  (Lord  Seaton), 
during  the  rebellions  of  1837-38.  General 
Rowan  was  now  appointed  to  command  H.M. 
forces  in  Canada,  and  Lord  Elgin  proceeded  to 
Toronto,  as  the  seat  of  government,  after  which 
it  was  transferred  to  Quebec.

IN  Canada,  there  are  certain  watering-places, 
where  in  the  hot  summer  months  sea  bathing  is 
enjoyed,  at  others,  mineral  springs,  the  fresh  air 
of  the  woods  and  exercise  restore  the  health  of 
those  "  in  cities  pent."  The  Caledonian  springs 
on  the  Ottawa,  have  been  long  frequented.  I 
visited,  with  my  small  family,  the  St  Leon 
springs  in  the  summer  of  1849,  then  a  new 
and  interesting  watering-place.  The  water  here 


28  PASSAGES    IN 

is  salime  and  rather  agreeable  to  the  taste,  and 
the  locality  is  twenty-one  miles  from  the  town  of 
Three  Rivers  on  the  St.  Lawrence.  The  road  lay 
through  a  country  smiling  with  cultivation,  and 
dotted  with  the  farm-houses  of  French  Canadians, 
till  the  wooded  and  picturesque  banks  of  the 
Riviere  du  Loup,  fringed  with  water  lilies,  are 
reached,  where  stood  the  "  Spring-house  "  which 
received  us. 

The  "Fountain  of  Health"  bubbled  up 
abundantly,  with  seats  round  it  under  a  roof; 
before  breakfast  the  water  is  aperient,  after,  it 
is  a  tonic.  It  was  a  wonderful  relief  to  escape 
from  the  heat,  dust,  confinement  and  disease  of 
a  city,  and  to  find  oneself  in  the  coolness  and 
quiet  of  the  St.  Leon  springs.  At  our  feet,  the 
river  glided  slowly  past,  and  on  it,  for  several 
miles  up  and  down,  there  was  very  good  boating 
and  fishing;  on  both  sides  of  the  river  the 
shelving  banks  were  clothed  with  fine  forests  of 
mixed  timber,  the  tall  pines  overtopping  the 
aspens,  constantly  shivering  in  the  breeze  below. 
In  the  morning  the  air  was  most  delicious,  fresh 
and  scented  with  the  balsamic  smell  of  the  green 
woods,  in  which  the  Canadian  robin  was  heard, 
mingling  its  rich  notes  with  the  plaintive  strains 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  29 

of  the  Kennedy  bird.  An  hour's  drive,  and 
a  walk  of  a  mile  and  a  half,  conducted  one  to  a 
water-fall  as  high  as  the  famed  Niagara. 
Health  and  pleasure  were  cheaply  acquired,  at 
the  charge  of  a  dollar  (4s.  *2d.)  a  day  at  the  St. 
Leon  Springs. 

I  continued  for  some  time  at  Sorel,  after 
having  been  requested  by  General  Rowan  to 
join  his  personal  staff.  I  made  an  excursion  in 
August  on  horseback,  with  Lady  Alexander, 
Miss  Stayner,  the  daughter  of  the  Post-Master- 
General,  Mr.  S.  Stayner,  and  Mr.  C.  Freer, 
round  the  lake  and  mountain  region  of  the 
Eastern  townships,  then  almost  a  terra  incognita 
to  the  inhabitants  of  the  Canadian  cities,  but 
soon  I  suppose  to  become  to  the  lovers  of  the 
picturesque,  like  our  Cumberland  lakes,  Killarney 
or  the  Scottish  highlands.  Gold,  iron,  and 
other  metals  are  found  there.  Wheat,  Indian 
corn,  oats,  potatoes,  are  also  raised  there.  The 
winter  is  less  severe  than  at  Montreal,  and 
there  is  no  lake  fever  as  in  some  other  parts  of 
the  west. 

Besides  our  saddle  horses,  with  a  cape  strapped 
on  in  front  for  a  shower,  we  had  a  light  one-horse 


30  PASSAGES   IN 

cart,  driven  by  a  groom,  for  our  carpet  bags,  con- 
taining a  complete  change  of  raiment,  also  some 
good  tea ;  but  we  trusted  to  the  houses  by  the 
way-side  for  the  rest  of  our  prevent.  Grey  soft 
hats  and  blue  veils  saved  the  head  and  eyes  from 
the  heat  and  the  glare. 

We  usually  rose  at  five,  took  some  milk  and 
bread,  and  mounting,  rode  some  fifteen  miles 
before  breakfast,  leisurely,  at  the  marching  pace 
of  dragoons,  then  breakfasted  and  halted  till  the 
afternoon,  reading  and  drawing  during  the  heat 
of  the  day.  Mounting  again,  we  rode  about 
the  same  distance  as  before,  then  stopped  for 
the  night  where  we  could  find  accommodation. 

We  went  by  the  St.  Francis  River  with  its 
bright  and  rapid  stream  enlivening  the  valuable 
farms  on  its  banks,  by  Drummondville,  Mel- 
bourne, Sherbroke  and  Lennox ville,  to  the  great 
Lake  Mernphramagog,  and  found  that  for  purity 
of  air  and  variety  of  prospects,  and  for 
mountain,  forest  and  lake  scenery,  and  for  its 
attractions  to  the  sportsmen,  in  fishing  and 
fowling,  the  region  of  the  Eastern  townships  far 
exceeded  the  famed  lakes  of  England,  very 
beautiful  though  they  be.  But  as  I  said,  these 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  31 

townships  were  not  appreciated,  and  a  few  years 
ago  were  not  resorted  to  by  persons  in  search 
of  information,  health  or  recreation. 

On  our  way  to  the  great  Memphramagog, 
the  charming  Lake  Massiwippi,  seven  miles  long, 
deep,  overshadowed  with  a  wooded  mountain, 
diversified  with  bays  and  headlands,  and  abound- 
ing in  capital  fish,  bass,  pickerel,  &amp;c.,  arrested 
our  attention.  The  thriving  farmers  there  were 
busy  with  their  hay  harvest,  the  ox  teams  were 
fat  and  lusty,  and  as  a  good  climate  and  fine 
scenery  are  usually  indicative  of  a  superior  race 
of  people,  the  men  were  strong  and  tall,  and 
among  the  women  there  were  some  of  the 
prettiest  girls  we  had  seen  in  Canada;  a 
traveller  might  be  apt  to  stop  them  on  the  road 
and  ask  them  about  distances  (which  he  might 
know  as  well  as  they  did)  in  order  to  have  the 
opportunity  of  admiring  them.  A  Massiwippi 
wife  might  sound  odd,  but  let  bachelor  settlers 
"  go  and  see." 

It  would  require  the  aid  of  poetry  to  describe 
the  noble  Memphramagog,  where 

"  Nor  fen,  nor  sedge 
Pollute  the  pure  lake's  crystal  edge 


32  PASSAGES   IN 

Abrupt  and  sheer  the  mountains  sink 
At  once  upon  the  level  brink ; 
Far  in  the  mirror  bright  and  blue 
Each  hill's  huge  outline  you  may  view." 

Its  scenery,  in  due  course  of  time,  will  cause 
the  inditing  of  many  verses  ;  a  poetic  tempera- 
ment would  there  be  speedily  developed  and 
matured. 

The  lake  is  thirty  miles  long,  and  four  broad, 
its  wooded  islands  number  a  score.  Its  greatest 
portion  is  in  British  territory,  its  upper  end 
belongs  to  our  enterprising  republican  neigh- 
bours ;  there  is  a  Scotch  settlement  within  our 
lines  at  "  the  Point,"  where  information  may  be 
got  regarding  the  prospects  of  a  farmer  there. 
The  Owl's  head,  from  whose  summit  Montreal 
mountain  may  be  seen,  towers  to  the  height  of 
2300  feet,  and  when  one  stands  directly  opposite 
to  it,  the  resemblance  to  a  recumbent  lion  is 
very  striking.  The  sugar  loaf  mountain  is  also 
a  fine  and  bold  elevation ;  beneath  the  shadow  of 
these  the  lake  is  at  least  500  feet  deep.  Moose 
deer  are  sometimes  shot  on  the  western  flanks 
of  these  mountains,  and  the  hunter  can  steal  on 
flocks  of  wild  ducks,  either  advancing  on  them 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  33 

from  the  woods  when  they  alight  on  the  bays  of 
the  lake,  or  suddenly  coming  on  them  round  a 
jutting  headland  in  his  canoe.  Gulls  screaming 
wildly,  are  constantly  seen  dipping  their  white 
wings  in  the  wave,  and  picking  up  dead  fish, 
also  shoals  of  fish  sparkle  on  the  surface  at 
sundown. 

As  usual  there  is  a  tale  of  a  great  water 
serpent  under  the  waters  of  Magog,  and  as  we 
rowed  along  to  visit  Skinner's  Cave  (where  a 
man  of  that  name  took  refuge  with  his  ox  team 
when  he  encountered  a  storm  on  the  ice)  we 
saw,  fishing  with  a  hundred  feet  line,  for  the 
spotted  lake  lunge  or  salmon,  the  sturdy 
borderer  Hewett,  who  professed  to  have  seen 
the  monster  several  times,  when  it  appeared  to 
be  "  as  thick  as  a  mill-log  forty  feet  long,  and 
with  a  head  like  a  horse."  However,  our  strong 
shouldered  boatman,  George  Dimond,  had  never 
encountered  this  leviathan,  though  he  had  lived 
forty  years  on  or  by  the  lakes. 

Below  the  outlet  of  Magog,  on  the  bright  and 
sparkling  river,  there  is  capital  fly  fishing ;  it  is 
obtained  by  hiring  a  canoe  with  a  man  to  pole 
it  up  stream,  who,  if  he  make  a  mistake  in 
"  setting  "  his  pole,  will  occasion  a  wetting  and

a  swim  to  the  fisherman ;  but  this  is  part  of 
the  excitement  of  sport ! 

Taking  a  last  look  at  this  lake  region,  we  will 
say  that  a  more  attractive  one  for  a  painter 
could  not  be  found,  a  fore-ground  enriched  with 
waving  plumes  of  fern,  diversified  with  blue  and 
yellow  wild  flowers,  and  rocks  right  and  left, 
in  the  middle  ground,  green  fields ;  beyond 
them,  fine  birch  and  maple  trees  standing  high 
above  the  lake,  and  descending  to  its  margin  ; 
across  the  broad  water,  mountains  shaggy  with 
primaeval  forests,  above  all,  massive  clouds  set 
in  a  cerulean  ground.  How  different  all  this 
from  the  dry  and  stony  deserts  of  Damara  land 
in  Africa,  where  we  had  formerly  wandered,  and 
were  often  reduced  to  the  greatest  straits  in  the 
midst  of  savage  men  and  beasts. 

Sheiford  and  Orford  Mountains,  not  far  off, 
are  loftier  than  those  about  Magog.  From  the 
latter,  4500  feet  high,  eighteen  lakes  may  be 
seen  at  once.  There  is  fine  Alpine  scenery  about 
the  Brome  Lake,  and  the  village  of  Waterloo  is 
beside  a  beautiful  lake  and  mountain.  Lake 
Megantic  is  in  a  region  of  game.  Where  wild- 
fowl "  most  do  congregate"  is  at  Missisquoi  Bay, 
an  inlet  of  Lake  Champlain.  Here  at  Philips- 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  35 

burgh  we  saw,  for  the  first  time,  a  long  carriage 
called  a  "  buck-board,"  which  is  used  about  there, 
and  which  might  be  adopted  elsewhere,  in  newly- 
settled  countries  with  rough  roads.  A  ten  or 
twelve-feet  plank  rests  on  the  axles  of  four 
waggon-wheels.  The  plank  is  fixed  to  the  hind 
axle,  but  revolves,  by  means  of  a  block  and 
pivot,  on  the  fore  one.  There  is  a  seat  on  the 
middle  of  the  plank  (which  is  its  own  spring), 
for  two  persons.  The  whole  looks  smart  when 
neatly  painted,  and  the  cost  is  only  twelve  dollars ; 
whereas  a  light  waggon,  affording  the  same  ac- 
commodation, costs  50  dollars.  Having  the 
wheels,  a  house-carpenter  can  make  the  rest; 
and  so  one  may  go  along  "  sparking"  for  a 
partner,  on  a  buck-board.  —-uL 

On  this  agreeable  journey,  round  the  southern 
frontier  of  Canada,  I  became  aware  of  the  ex- 
istence of  a  party  to  annex  Canada  to  the 
United  States  after  the  late  troubles  at  Montreal ; 
and  I  was  in  one  of  their  places  of  meeting. 
Fortunately,  their  proceedings  came  to  nothing. 
I  was  also  impressed  with  the  absurdity  of  the 
relations  then  subsisting  between  Canada  and 
the  United  States,  by  which  the  latter  imposed 
20  per  cent  duty  on  the  produce  of  the  former, 

D  2 


36  PASSAGES   IN 

and  droves  of  cattle  and  horses,  and  sheep  in 
large  quantities  were  taken  over  the  lines  from 
Canada  at  5  per  cent.,  and  even  less. 

Thus  at  an  American  village  near  the  frontier, 
there  was  a  custom-house  officer  who  imposed 
a  duty  of  a  quarter  of  a  dollar  on  Canadian 
two-year-old  heifers,  the  value  of  which  might 
be  nine  dollars  a-head,  and  three  quarters 
of  a  dollar  on  three-year-olds,  and  on  other 
lestial  in  the  same  proportion.  There  was 
great  traffic  through  this  village,  and  it  throve 
apace ;  but  this  custom-house  officer  was  one 
day  changed,  and  another  was  sent  in  his 
place,  who  began  to  exact  higher  duties,  and 
the  flocks  and  herds  took  another  route. 
The  Yankees  then  acted  in  their  own  peculiar 
manner.  They  avoided  social  intercourse  with 
the  new  official — "  he  had  no  friends."  His 
board  was  doubled  at  the  inn,  and  he  was 
threatened  with  Lynch  law.  All  this  had  its 
effect.  They  got  back  the  "  old  man,"  and  all 
went  on  quietly  and  comfortably  as  before. 

Again,  an  American  cattle-dealer  would  come 
into  Canada,  buy  200  head  of  lean  cattle  for  a 
small  sum,  say  in  February  when  forage  is  scarce, 
then  drive  them  to  the  lines,  and  scatter  them 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  37 

on  the  ice.  Who  was  to  know  if  they  were 
Canadian  or  American  cattle  ?  and  so  he  would 
get  them  across  without  any  duty  at  all. 

The  promulgation  of  these  and  similar  facts, 
perhaps  tended  to  lead  to  reciprocity  between 
Canada  and  the  United  States,  to  effect  which 
great  object,  Lord  Elgin  laboured  hard  and 
successfully.  After  Great  Britain  had  liberally 
opened  her  ports  to  the  Americans,  they  could 
not  well  exclude  Canadian  produce,  and  at  the 
same  time  derive  benefit  from  the  navigation  of 
the  St.  Lawrence,  and  participation  in  our  fishing 
grounds  ;  yet  what  a  disturbance  the  enlistment 
of  a  few  "  loafers"  lately  occasioned  ! 

We  returned  to  Sorel.  Afterwards  we  took 
up  our  residence  at  Beaver  Hall,  Montreal, 
where  were  the  duties  and  gaieties  usual  in  a 
garrison  town,  marching  and  drilling  the  troops, 
sleigh-driving  and  snow-shoeing,  balls  and  mu- 
sical entertainments.  A  few  families  met  at 
each  other's  houses  alternately  for  the  practice  of 
music — an  agreeable  arrangement  for  the  winter. 

Having  been  previously  employed  on  a  Govern- 
ment exploration  and  survey  in  the  forests  of 
New  Brunswick,  to  facilitate  communication 
between  Canada  and  the  maritime  provinces,

and  develop  the  resources  of  an  unproductive, 
though  valuable  region,  I  got  habituated  to 
the  woods,  and  was  not  happy  without  an  oc- 
casional break  to  smell  the  fresh  pines.  We 
accordingly  now  propose  to  "  drive  the  deer'* 
at  the  Chateauguay  Lake — 

"  How  divine 

The  liberty  for  frail,  for  mortal  man 
To  roam  at  large  among  unpeopled  glens

To  oldest  time." 

Forest,  lake,  and  mountain,  in  their  untamed 
wildness,  still  occupy  vast  regions  in  the 
northern  portions  of  the  great  state  of  New 
York,  west  of  the  great  inland  sea  of  Cham- 
plain,  and  the  lovely  waters  of  Lake  George ; 
woodsmen  and  trappers  are  found  scattered  here 
and  there  in  small  communities,  or  in  solitary 
shanties,  (log  huts,)  in  these  great  solitudes, 
where  still  roam  the  moose  deer,  with  its 
palmated  horns  and  huge  bulk,  the  brown  Vir-

racoons,  and  other  game,  animals  and  beasts  of 
prey.  The  Beaver,  Oswegatche,  Racket,  Sara- 
nac,  and  other  clear  and  rapid  streams,  are

occasionally  visited  by  the  huntsmen  and  fishers 
from  more  civilized  regions,  and  here,  life  in  the 
woods  may  be  enjoyed  to  its  fullest  extent — the 
sensibilities  being  powerfully  influenced  by  the 
clear  skies  and  solemn  hills  overhead  ;  the  dark 
woods  and  bright  waters  around ;  and  the  air 
redolent  of  the  balsamic  odours  of  the  silent 
wilderness. 

It  was  early  in  November,  the  weather  was 
bright,  and  the  first  snow  lay  lightly  on  the 
ground,  when  I  left  Montreal,  to  cross  the 
Canadian  frontier  and  journey  towards  Lake 
Chateauguay,  situated  in  the  region  above  des- 
cribed ;  a  favourite  haunt  for  the  deer,  and,  in 
the  summer,  affording  abundant  sport  to  the 
fisherman.  I  intended  to  join  the  "  camp"  of 
two  American  sportsmen,  who  had  gone  on 
before,  and  who  had  engaged  all  the  dogs  about 
the  lake,  for  the  purpose  of  driving  the  deer  to 
the  water,  and  there  securing  them  for  their 
winter  supply  of  venison.  Neither  they  nor 
myself  were  of  that  class  of  sportsmen  (so 
called)  who  kill  for  the  mere  gratification  of 
destroying  the  creatures  so  bountifully  provided 
for  the  use  of  man ;  and,  for  my  own  part,  I 
think  there  is  as  much  gratification  in  wander-

ing  among  fine  scenery,  and  in  the  adventure 
of  the  chase,  as  in  the  actual  "  bagging"  the 
denizens  of  the  woods  and  wilds.  Let  it  be 
remembered  also,  that  woodcraft  is  a  very 
essential  part  of  military  training. 

Crossing  Lake  St.  Louis  to  La  Prairie,  and 
journeying  through  the  flat  country  towards  the 
south,  I  fell  in  with  an  artillery  officer  and  a 
clergyman ;  our  conversation  turned  on  moral 
reform,  temperance,  and  similar  topics.  "A 
mild  answer  turneth  away  wrath,"  and,  in  a 
similar  manner,  had  the  worthy  pastor  managed 
to  get  rid  of  a  nuisance.  He  disliked  smoking ; 
and,  seeing  the  driver  proceeding  to  light  his 
pipe  beside  him,  he  ventured  to  remonstrate; 
the  driver  took  no  notice  of  this,  but  com- 
menced smoking,  when  the  clergyman  taking 
two  apples  out  of  his  pocket,  said — "  I  have 
two  good  apples  here;  will  you  take  one?" 
The  driver  did  so,  ate  it,  and  put  away  his  pipe. 

Passing  St.  John's — a  military  post  for  the 
Canadian  rifles,  we  reached  Rouse's  point,  on 
Lake  Champlain,  where  the  Americans  have  a 
stone  fort,  to  command  the  navigation  of  the 
River  Richelieu,  flowing  towards  Lower  Canada. 
An  illustration  of  the  customs  still  prevalent  in 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  41 

this  section  of  country,  was  shown  by  a  traveller 
who  arrived  here.  On  applying  to  the  landlord 
of  the  hotel  for  a  bed,  he  answered,  "  they  are 
all  full ;  but,"  said  he,  pointing  to  an  English- 
man, "  I  dare  say  that  gentleman  will  not  object 
to  share  his  bed  with  you."  The  Briton  how- 
ever replied,  "  I  do  object ;"  when  the  other 
indignantly  rejoined,  "  Well,  I  dare  say  I  can 
get  some  other  gentleman  to  sleep  along  with 
me,  anyhow." 

From  Rouse's  Point  I  journeyed  to  Chateau- 
guay  village,  or  "  Four  Corners."  Here  lay,  in 
1813,  the  army  of  General  Hampton,  previous 
to  the  daring  attempt  to  penetrate  to  Montreal, 
by  the  Chateauguay  river ;  and  which  resulted 
in  a  gallant  and  successful  action,  by  a  body  of 
Canadians,  in  defence  of  their  country.  We 
shall  close  this  paper  with  an  account  of  this 
useful  lesson  in  bush-fighting. 

On  enquiring  my  way  to  an  inn,  in  order  to 
get  a  waggon  to  go  on  to  the  hunting-ground, 
an  American  sportsman,  with  his  "  wiping  rod" 
in  his  rifle,  directed  me  where  to  find  one. 
Shouldering  my  leather-bag,  I  was  met  by  the 
landlord,  who,  relieving  me  of  it,  walked  on 
before,  with  the  remark,  "  Considerable  heft 


42  PASSAGES    IN 

(stuff)  in  this  bag,  I  guess  ?"  "  Can  I  get  a 
waggon  to  go  on  to  Lake  Chateauguay,  this 
evening  ?"  I  enquired.  "  You  will  be  froze 
up,"  said  he,  "  before  you  get  half-way.  I 
would  not  go  for  the  best  five  dollars  in  the 
country ;  mud  freezes  to  the  wheels  till  you 
can't  see  through  them,  and  there's  too  little 
snow  for  sleigh-runners." 

Bargaining  to  get  away  at  dawn  next  morn- 
ing, I  comforted  myself  with  tea,  (as  did  half-a- 
dozen  other  wayfarers)  accompanied  with  soft 
toast  and  plain  bread  of  very  excellent  quality, 
corned  beef,  and  smoked  venison,  biscuits  and 
honeycomb  ;  and,  wrapping  myself  in  my  plaid, 
slept  well  on  the  outside  of  a  bed.  In  almost 
all  countries,  in  small  inns,  for  a  night,  this 
practice  is  safer  for  health  than  getting  between 
the  clothes ;  and  it  should  not  make  much 
difference  to  old  campaigners  whether  they  sleep 
ready  dressed  or  not. 

Next  morning,  "  inspanning"  a  pair  of  horses 
in,  a  light  waggon,  and  placing  in  it  my  gun,  axe, 
and  wallet,  we  travelled,  with  much  plunging, 
over  a  partially-frozen  road,  and  passed  some 
clearings,  with  frame  and  log-houses,  raised  by 
French,  Canadian,  and  Irish  settlers ;  but  the

best  "  locations"  had  been  selected  by  the  more 
acute  Americans,  on  higher  and  better  land ; 
and  not  in  hollows  like  the  others. 

At  length,  a  broad  patch  of  water  appeared 
through  the  forest;  it  was  part  of  the  lower 
Lake  Chateauguay,  backed  by  a  wooded  hill ; 
and  before  us,  in  a  clearing,  was  the  respectable- 
looking  "  Hunters'  Inn,"  of  Mr.  Bellows ; 
himself  an  old  and  retired  hunter,  and  the  father 
of  some  sturdy  sons,  "  well  used  to  the  bush." 

"  Old  Bellows,"  who  was  seventy  years  of 
age,  (and  was  playing  with  his  grand-child; 
whilst  the  mother,  a  remarkably  fine  young 
woman,  stood  by  to  complete  the  group)  had 
been  thirty  years  about  the  lake,  and  slain  his 
800  deer,  was  full  of  anecdotes  about  "  the 
wild."  Among  other  facts  in  Natural  History, 
he  said  that  he  remarked  that  here  the  salmon 
tribe  spawned  in  October,  the  ovce  lay  dormant 
all  the  winter,  and  were  vivified  in  spring. 

There  are  two  Lakes  Chateauguay,  an  upper 
and  a  lower,  connected  with  "  narrows."  The 
upper  lake,  where  there  are  no  settlements,  is 
five  miles  long,  the  "  narrows"  four,  and  the 
lower  lake  is  two  miles  in  length.  I  asked  Mr. 
Bellows  for  a  boat  to  go  to  the  Upper  Lake, 


44  PASSAGES    IN 

and  he  said  his  best  boats  were  away,  but 
"  there  was  a  machine"  at  the  landing  I  might 
have.  I  got  into  this  tub-like  conveyance,  with 
a  stout  lad,  and  we  pulled  and  paddled  towards 
the  narrows. 

I  thought  I  should  have  had  my  hands  frost- 
bitten, the  cold  being  great  on  the  water ;  and, 
also,  as  my  companion  said,  "  it  started  snow- 
ing." We  had  noble  views  of  hill  and  forest, 
far  and  near,  as  we  passed  up  the  narrows ;  a 
wooded  island  was  at  "  the  outlet,"  and  then  the 
fine  broad  Upper  Lake  opened  on  us,  with  Lyon 
Mountain,  and  other  lesser  eminences  rising 
in  the  S.E.  The  only  signs  of  man  were  a 
wooden,  uninhabited  lodge  on  another  island, 
and  one  on  Indian  Point. 

We  looked  about  for  the  smoke  of  the  fires 
of  those  we  were  in  search  of,  and  presently 
heard  the  baying  of  a  hound  in  the  forest, 
evidently  in  pursuit  of  a  deer,  and  driving  it 
towards  the  water ;  then  the  sound  of  chopping 
directed  us  to  a  log  hut  or  shanty,  where  we 
found  black  Jacob,  the  cook,  boiling  a  kettle 
outside,  whilst  near  him  a  fine  deer  hung  by  the 
heels  from  a  branch. 

The   shanty,    backed   by    the   pine   woods, 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  45 

formed  a  picture  of  a  temporary  forest  home. 
From  the  extremity  of  a  stove-pipe,  projecting 
from  the  bark  roof,  curled  a  thin  wreath  of 
smoke ;  a  fringe  of  icicles  depended  from  the 
eaves,  and  the  walls  were  composed  of  round 
fir-trees.  A  small  dog-kennel,  a  miniature  of 
the  house,  was  close  to  the  door.  Inside 
there  were  a  rough  table  and  benches,  sporting 
gear  hanging  from  nails,  mess  tins  and  plates 
on  shelves,  and  blankets  and  tarpaulins  rolled 
up  in  corners,  and  which,  at  night,  covered  the 
floor  to  form  the  hunters'  beds. 

After  refreshing  with  some  cold  meat  and 
biscuit,  we  pushed  again  into  the  lake,  and 
steered  for  Indian  Point,  a  commanding  head- 
land of  gneiss  rock,  projecting  into  the  deep 
and  clear  water;  from  this  a  grand  prospect 
was  obtained  of  Lyon  mountain  opposite,  appa- 
rently some  thousands  of  feet  high,  and  now 
powdered  with  early  snow,  whilst  below  were 
swelling  ridges,  dark  with  the  evergreen  firs. 
Light,  fleecy  clouds  floated  in  the  transparent 
American  sky,  and  the  glad  waters  sparkled  in 
the  sunlight. 

Two  hunters,  in  grey  coats  and  leather 
leggings,  were  watching  anxiously  for  the  deer 


46  PASSAGES    IN 

emerging  from  the  woods  and  taking  the  water, 
and  their  boat  was  ready  to  pull  towards  the 
game.  Most  people  fancy  that  slaying  deer  in 
the  water  is  a  very  easy  matter ;  it  may  be  so 
when  the  lake  is  smooth,  but  it  is  very  dif- 
ferent when  there  is  a  swell  on,  and  the  deer 
has  got  a  considerable  start  of  his  pursuers.  It 
is  so  difficult  to  take  aim  then,  that  before  one 
deer  was  killed  by  a  party  of  three  hunters,  on 
a  stormy  day,  upwards  of  twenty  shots  were 
fired  at  him,  and,  after  six  rounds,  one  of  the 
hunters  laid  his  rifle  down  in  the  boat  in 
despair,  and  the  poor  animal  was  eventually 
secured  by  the  stroke  of  a  paddle. 

After  some  tarry  at  Indian  Point,  we  pulled 
towards  "  Split  rock,"  also  a  favourite  look-out. 
The  baying  of  the  unseen  hounds  in  the  woods, 
was  now  followed  by  a  shot,  and  the  appearance 
of  Louis  Bellows,  and  presently  a  plump  doe  lay 
at  the  bottom  of  our  boat. 

This  deer,  the  Cervus  Virginianus,  is  found 
from  the  banks  of  the  St.  Lawrence  to  the 
shores  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  ;  of  graceful  mien 
and  elegant  form,  its  coat  varies  in  colour  ac- 
cording to  the  season  of  the  year,  in  summer  a 
reddish  brown,  and  in  winter,  when  the  indivi- 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  47 

dual  hairs  become  tubular  like  a  bird's  quill, 
they  are  of  a  greyish  russet  colour.  The  weight 
of  the  Virginian  deer  is  one  hundred  pounds 
and  upwards;  the  horns  of  the  male  resemble 
two  crescents  in  front  of  the  eyes,  with  the 
prongs  pointing  forwards,  so  that  it  is  sur- 
prising how  they  manage  to  get  through  the 
bush.  The  long  ears  are  in  constant  motion 
to  catch  the  slightest  sound,  and  the  soft  large 
eye  of  exceeding  beauty,  would  disarm  many 
a  hunter  if  viewed  closely. 

The  wanton  destruction  of  this  or  of  any 
other  of  the  gifts  of  Providence,  provided  for 
the  sustenance  of  man,  is  most  reprehensible, 
but  we  have  never  scrupled  to  indulge  in  the 
chase  in  moderation,  particularly  as  we  never 
have  yet  assisted  to  slay  the  /era  nature, 
except  to  use  them  or  to  let  others  do  so ;  and 
we  esteem  it  no  proof  of  manhood,  but  quite 
the  contrary,  to  brag  of  "  a  heavy  bag,"  the 
greater  part  of  which  may  have  been  left  to 
rot  in  the  field. 

When  the  deer,  driven  from  the  covert  of 
the  forest,  came  to  the  water's  edge,  they  would 
trip  about  hesitatingly  and  anxiously,  looking 
now  across  the  lake  and  then  towards  the  wood, 


48  PASSAGES    IN 

and  if  they  did  not  take  the  water  (in  which 
they  swam,  showing  their  heads  and  part  of 
their  backs)  they  would  try  to  conceal  them- 
selves in  a  bush  or  in  the  top  branches  of  a 
fallen  tree ;  one  was  shot  in  this  last  position. 

In  the  afternoon,  no  more  deer  being  inclined 
to  take  to  the  water,  the  dogs  were  brought 
into  the  boats,  and  we  rowed  and  paddled  back 
to  the  shanty.  My  comrades  in  the  chase, 
Mr.  Harrison  Stephens  and  Mr.  Fellers,  were 
both  excellent  shots  with  the  rifle,  the  former 
was  also  a  most  expert  salmon  and  bass 
fisherman.  Till  middle  age,  he  had  been 
extensively  and  successfully  engaged  in  the 
mercantile  profession,  when,  finding  that  too 
close  attention  to  business  was  injuring  his 
health,  he  wisely  abandoned  his  desk  in  sum- 
mer, and  took  to  the  woods  and  streams,  and 
immediately  recovered  his  physical  energies. 

The  rifles  which  these  American  sportsmen 
used  were  the  "  Wesson"  and  the  "  James," 
both  very  excellent  of  their  kind;  the  first 
weighed  eight  and  a  half  pounds,  the  other 
twelve  pounds,  which  were  suited  to  the  size 
and  weight  of  those  who  carried  them.  To 
load  men  of  all  sizes,  and  varying  in  strength, 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  49 

with  the  same  heavy  weapon,  had  better  be 
avoided  if  it  is  possible  to  do  so  ;  as  has  been 
often  clearly  shown  by  that  practical  soldier, 
Colonel  Leach. 

The  small  conical  balls  of  the  Wesson  rifle, 
thirty-five  to  the  pound,  were  most  carefully 
cast,  and  smoothly  turned  or  "  swedged ;"  they 
were  without  belts  or  projections  on  the  surface, 
were  solid  throughout,  and  were  loaded  with  a 
ramrod  with  a  cup,  and  introduced  into  the 
barrel  by  means  of  a  loading,  or  false  muzzle 
(fixed  whilst  loading  with  pins)  so  as  to  give 
them  the  true  direction  into  the  piece  with 
two  taps  from  the  "  starter."  I  saw  that 
these  small  balls  made  wounds  through  and 
through  the  deer,  and  in  practising  at  trees 
with  the  Wesson  rifle,  the  ball  penetrated  five 
inches  into  the  green  hard  wood  at  sixty  yards. 
The  sight  was  carefully  adjusted  to  the  right 
or  left,  after  repeated  trials  from  a  fixed  rest, 
by  a  graduated  index  at  the  muzzle,  and  there 
was  a  globe  sight,  flat,  circular  and  with  a  hole 
in  the  middle,  fixed  behind  the  breech.  The 
strength  of  the  powder  having  been  ascertained, 
the  proper  quantity  was  carefully  weighed  in 
small  scales,  and  though  the  powder  employed

was  Hazard's  Kentucky-rifle-powder,  which  soils 
very  little,  the  use  of  the  wiping  rod  was 
frequent,  so  careful  and  particular  are  the 
American  hunters.  The  attitude  for  correct 
shooting  is  important ;  thus,  for  "  off-hand" 
shooting,  or  without  a  rest,  if  the  rifleman  has 
to  fire  at  an  object,  say  north  of  him,  he  fronts 
his  hody  due  east,  his  legs  being  firmly  fixed 
and  apart,  and  then  aims  to  the  north,  pressing 
back  his  right  shoulder  with  the  butt ;  this 
position  will  be  found  much  more  steady  than 
the  usual  one. 

"  The  Kentucky  dodge,"  is  a  crooked  iron 
from  the  hip,  supporting  the  left  arm.  I 
prefer  as  a  rest,  kneeling,  an  iron  ramrod, 
swivelled,  and  the  small  end  fitting  into  a  hole 
drilled  near  the  muzzle.  This  rest  is  always 
at  hand,  cannot  be  lost,  and  it  is  evident  that  a 
line  of  kneeling  musketeers,  with  arms  in  rest, 
and  waiting  for  an  advancing  foe,  would 
assuredly  produce  a  terrible  effect,  when  they 
opened  their  fire. 

The  "James"  rifle  was  provided  with  a 
telescope,  in  appearance  like  a  large  ramrod, 
which  was  placed  along  the  barrel,  when 
required  for  long  ranges,  500  yards  and 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  51 

upwards  :     the    balls    used    were  conical    and 
solid,  like  those  for  the  Wesson.* 

On  African  expeditions,  and  when  the 
country  afforded  that  cover  which  enabled  one 
to  creep  upon  and  close  with  the  large  animals 
of  the  chase,  I  found  that,  for  a  long  day's 
work,  a  light-rifled-carbine  was  sufficient ;  one, 
the  range  of  which  was  200  yards,  and  throw- 
ing a  ball,  24  to  the  pound — one-third  pewter 
and  two-thirds  lead,  hard  and  heavy.  When 
not  in  the  act  of  creeping,  the  carbine  had  best 
be  slung,  and  a  light  six  foot  pike  be  used 
as  a  walking-stick,  for  the  hills  and  rough 
ground  generally  :  it  is  also  a  capital  weapon 
for  offence,  is  much  more  "  handy"  in  fencing 
than  a  musket  and  bayonet,  or  rifle  and  sword ; 
whilst  a  loose  strap  round  the  middle,  and  a 
pike  butt,  like  a  fishing-rod,  converts  it  into 
a  rest ;  and,  for  want  of  rests,  what  a  quantity 
of  valuable  ammunition  is  constantly  wasted  ! 
Half-a-dozen  of  these  pikes,  piled  three  and

weight,  six  pounds  at  least,  and  carrying  balls  thirty  to

pounds  for  average-sized  men.

three  (or  the  same  number  of  muskets,  with 
cleaning-rods  in  two  of  them),  with  a  turn  of 
a  ridge  rope  round  two,  and  pegged  down  to 
the  ground  at  the  "  ends  of  the  tether,"  make 
a  good  ranger's  tent;  the  cover  at  the  back, 
(with  triangular  ends)  being  light  striped  tick- 
ing, 12  ft.  by  10  feet,  weighing  8  pounds: 
in  front  is  the  fire.  A  bell-tent,  with  its  pole, 
pegs  and  mallets,  weighs  65  Ibs.  Our  poor 
fellows  suffered  much  from  rain  and  cold 
during  some  of  the  patrols  in  Kaffir-land,  having 
no  rangers'  tents,  and  being  unable  to  transport 
the  heavy  bell-tent.*

mess  tins,  rapid  forays  may  be  made  in  wild 
countries  by  hardy  and  active  partisans. 

The  Highlanders,  Swiss,  Tyrolese,  Kaffirs, 
&amp;c.,  use  long  walking-sticks,  among  their  hills, 
whilst  the  inhabitants  of  plains  may  not 
appreciate  their  utility  to  diminish  fatigue  or 
for  partisan  warfare. 

After  this  roving  digression,  let  us  return  to 
the  Lake  and  its  denizens.  I  observed,  in 
retired  bays  of  the  lake,  wild  fowl  of  various 
kinds,  which  did  not  seem  to  have  been  much 
disturbed  as  they  quietly  swam  about  and 
fished,  till  the  hunter,  concealing  himself  behind 
a  young  fir-tree  set  up  in  front  of  him  in  the 
boat,  was  pulled  within  shot  of  the  birds.  The 
black  duck,  with  its  yellowish-red  bill,  was  seen ; 
also  the  handsome  goosander,  or  sheldrake, 
with  its  fine  crest,  its  slender  bill,  black  head 
glossed  with  green,  black  back,  breast  and  belly 
white,  and  cinnamon-coloured  neck,  swam 
lightly  on  the  waves,  or  suddenly  disappeared 
beneath  them. 

Before  we  settled  ourselves  for  the  night,  I 
went  off  in  a  boat,  to  assist  in  lifting  the  gill- 
net,  twenty  yards  long  by  one  deep,  which  had 
been  set  all  day  on  a  shoal,  on  which  there  was 


54  PASSAGES    IN 

six  feet  of  water  opposite  the  outlet  of  the  Upper 
Lake.  We  found  entangled  in  the  meshes, 
half-a-dozen  white  fish,  two  or  three  pounds 
weight  each,  and  of  delicate  flavour,  for  our 
evening  meal ;  of  which,  also,  sheldrake  formed 
a  part,  and  which  our  black  cook  had  deprived 
of  their  fishy  tast,  by  boiling  them  in  three 
waters,  and  then  stewing  them. 

We  fared  sumptuously  and  with  keen  appe- 
tites, on  fish,  flesh,  and  fowl;  told  hunter's 
stories  afterwards,  and  tried,  in  vain,  to  relieve 
one  of  the  dogs,  which  was  brought  in  with  his 
face  swelled  from  the  quills  of  a  porcupine,  two 
of  which  animals  had  been  "  treed"  and  shot ; 
but  which  our  hunters  disdained  to  bring  in 
for  the  pot,  though  the  meat  is  good  eating,  if 
it  is  both  boiled  and  roasted  to  soften  the 
"  crackling." 

The  north  American  Porcupine  is  a  remark- 
able quadruped  ;  and,  though  one  of  the  most 
sluggish  in  creation,  is  admirably  adapted  for 
the  locality  it  inhabits,  and  is  well  defended 
from  the  weather  and  from  its  foes,  by  its  fur, 
hair,  bristles,  and  quills.  Its  form  is  thick  set 
with  an  arched  back,  its  colour  black,  except 
where  the  white  ends  of  the  quills,  showing 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  55 

beyond  the  hair,  give  a  mottled  appearance ;  its 
feet,  armed  with  strong  claws  for  burrowing  or 
climbing  trees,  are  prevented  sinking  into  the 
snow  by  the  lateral  arrangement  of  the  hairs : 
its  strong  incisor  teeth  enable  it  to  feed  on  roots 
and  bark;  it  also  consumes  fruit  and  grain. 
Its  quills  are  easily  detached  from  the  skin,  and, 
as  we  saw  by  our  unfortunate  hound,  inflict 
terrible  wounds  by  switching  with  its  tail,  the 
barbs  at  the  tips  of  the  quills  working  them  into 
the  flesh  and  causing  great  swelling  and  irrita- 
tion, and  thus,  for  the  time,  rendered  the 
sufferer  useless. 

The  quills  of  the  African  porcupine  are  very 
long;  and  there  being  no  occasion  for  much 
hair  for  warmth  there,  the  quills  clash  with  the 
motion  of  the  animal.  In  the  war  of  1835,  I 
have  mistaken  the  rustling  of  the  quills  on  a 
night-march,  for  the  noise  of  a  bundle  of  Kaffir 
assegaes. 

Our  assistant  hunters,  four  in  number,  two 
of  the  Bellows'  family,  Stores  and  Avery,  were 
in  the  habit  of  trapping  sable  (ermine)  minx, 
martin,  &amp;c.,  in  the  wild  country  to  the  west  of 
us,  in  the  direction  of  the  Racket  river ;  and 
where,  also,  stray  beavers  are  seen,  and  panthers

encountered.  There  is  a  splendid  sporting 
country  south,  about  the  Saranac  lakes,  where 
deer  and  fish  may  be  met  with  in  abundance.* 
I  may  here  mention  that,  in  summer,  the  pest 
of  the  black  flies  and  mosquitoes  may  be  defied, 
by  an  admixture  of  oil,  camphor,  penny-royal 
and  kreosote.  1  found  camphor  and  oil  alone 
of  little  use  whilst  exploring  in  the  New  Bruns- 
wick forests. 

*  Major  the  Hon.  Fane  Keane,  Captains  Gallwey  and  Lam- 
bert, R.  E.,  Collingwood,  late  89th,  &amp;c.,  have  successfully 
sported  in  this  region.

ON  the  7th  November,  Stores,  the  hunter, 
being  appointed  to  the  duty,  woke  us  at  4,  A.M. 
exactly,  his  own  usual  hour  of  rising,  as  it  is 
with  many  "  pushers  of  fortune"  in  the  States. 
The  morning  was  beautiful,  calm  and  frosty. 
Of  course  there  was  no  appearance  of  dawn  on 
the  grey  and  cloudless  sky  ;  and  the  waters  of 
the  lake,  whilst  performing  my  early  ablutions, 
lay  motionless  in  the  star-light,  which  revealed 
the  dark  outlines  of  the  opposite  hills.

Springing  about  for  a  short  time,  to  supple 
the  limbs  and  give  an  appetite  for  breakfast,  I 
returned  to  the  shanty,  where  Jacob,  the  cook, 
had  prepared  a  savoury  stew ;  and,  at  half-past 
five,  the  three  boats  were  launched  and  rowed 
up  the  lake  past  the  Ouleout  brook,  and  posi- 
tions were  taken  up  at  Split  rock,  Indian  Point, 
and  the  Western  inlet.  The  sunrise  was 
splendid  behind  the  snow-powdered  head  of  the 
Lyon  mountain,  and  was  ushered  in  with  orange 
and  golden  clouds;  till  the  dark  woods  and 
waters  of  the  lake  were  lighted  up,  we  had 
rowed  through  mist  clouds  which  floated  away 
towards  the  north. 

This  day,  with  so  bright  a  beginning,  we  had 
no  success  among  the  deer,  which  had  gone  off 
towards  Ragged  Lake,  so  named  from  its  in- 
dented shores;  perhaps  the  deer  were  scared, 
thinking,  probably,  that  there  would  be  ice  on 
Chateauguay,  in  which  case  they  avoid  the  lake. 
Ruffed  grouse,  though  here  called  partridges,  and 
white  fish  were  killed.  These  Alhamegs,  or 
white  fish  (the  Coregonus  Albus  of  the  salmon 
family)  are  the  most  delicious  of  fresh-water 
fish  in  America,  and  seem  partial  to  cold,  deep, 
and  clear  water.  They  are  blueish  grey  on  the 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  59 

back,  lighter  on  the  sides,  and  white  on  the 
belly,  and  are  very  deep  for  their  length.  One 
never  tires  of  eating  white  fish — or,  as  one  of 
the  hunters  said,  "  I  am  death  on  the  fish." 

In  Lake  Chateauguay,  besides  the  white  fish, 
of  excellent  flavour,  there  are  two  other  es- 
teemed fish,  the  lake  trout,  the  salmo  confinis 
of  Dekay,  which  attains  a  weight  of  from 
15  Ibs.  to  201bs.,  and  the  well-known  speckled 
trout,  which  rarely  exceeds  three  pounds  or 
four  pounds,  and  its  delicacy  of  flavour  has 
ever  been  fully  acknowledged.  The  short  and 
thick  Ontario  salmon  has  been  caught  here,  but 
it  is  rare. 

My  friend,  Dr.  W.  Agar  Adamson,  one  of 
the  best  fishermen  in  North  America,  (and  I 
may  also  add,  highly  distinguished  in  the 
pulpit)  has  found  that  for  fly-hooks,  bodies  of 
fiery  brown  and  claret  are  the  most  killing 
for  these  western  waters.  The  trout,  like  other 
denizens  of  this  new  country,  have  not  got  very 
fastidious  appetites,  so  that  when  they  are  on 
the  feed,  almost  any  fly  will  take  them.  It 
is  recommended  to  fishermen  who  venture  on 
Jakes  like  Chateauguay,  whilst  gently  fly-fishing 
along  the  shores,  to  have  a  second  rod,  trolling 


60  PASSAGES    IN 

a  real  or  artificial  minnow  after  the  boat,  about 
eighteen  or  twenty  yards  behind,  and  there  is 
a  great  secret  of  success  in  a  long  rod  and  line. 

The  most  deadly  way  of  fishing  in  these 
North  American  lakes,  and  the  simplest,  and 
far  before  the  minnow,  is  the  spoon.  A  thin 
piece  of  brass  or  silver,  shaped  like  a  table-spoon 
without  the  handle,  is  attached  to  a  stout  line 
(linen  line  is  the  best)  by  means  of  gimp  and  a 
swivel,  and  double  or  triple  hooks  are  fixed 
to  the  lower  end  of  the  spoon,  this  apparatus 
revolves  in  eccentric  circles  in  the  water,  when 
trolled  from  a  canoe  or  boat ;  fish  of  the  largest 
size  are  attracted  by  it,  and  either  hook  them- 
selves on  it  whilst  trying  to  seize  it,  or  are 
hooked  by  it,  whilst  incautiously  examining  it.* 

In  sitting  by  the  fire  at  night,  and  entering 
into  conversation  with  Jacob,  he  said  he  had 
run  away  from  slavery  in  Virginia,  because  he 
felt  no  security  there.  On  asking  him  to 
explain,  he  answered,  "  I  may  have  a  good 
master,  who  does  not  ill-use  me,  but  he  may 
gamble,  and  lose  me  at  cards,  and  I  may  get 

*  This  year,  a  piece  of  white  metal,  twisted  like  a  cork- 
screw and  with  a  fish's  head,  was  in  fashion — its  motion 
through  the  water  being  very  inviting. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  61 

into  bad  hands ;  this  makes  our  coloured  people 
always  uneasy;  besides,  the  fine  is  5,000  dollars 
and  six  months'  imprisonment,  if  any  one 
teaches  us  to  read,  and  many  of  us  wish  very 
much  to  learn,  so  we  *  clear  out,'  when  we  have 
the  chance." 

A  thin  crust  of  ice  began  now  to  form  on 
the  shallow  parts  of  the  lake,  and  in  the 
Narrows ;  we  were  afraid  of  being  frozen  in — 
and  eleven  deer  (on  the  water,  on  the  shore, 
and  in  the  forest)  having  been  secured,  into  the 
stomach  of  one  of  which  I  caused  some  white 
fish  to  be  sewn,  as  the  best  means  of  carrying 
them,  to  give  a  treat  to  friends  in  Montreal — 
we  rowed  back  to  Bellows'  on  Saturday  night, 
and  tarried  the  Sabbath  there.  It  was  worth 
while  to  go  into  the  country  to  eat  the  delicious 
bread,  such  as  Mrs.  Louis  Bellows  made  with 
"milk  emptyings,"  or  milk,  flower,  and  salt 
mixed  and  warmed,  to  form  a  yeast,  to  raise 
the  bread  with.  Young  American  farmers,  in 
selecting  a  wife,  usually  inquire,  "  Can  she 
make  good  bread  ?"  and  this  is  very  important 
for  comfort,  when  "  remote  from  cities." 

In  Midsummer  the  usual  way  of  shooting 
the  deer  at  Lake  Chateauguay,  (and  as  I  also 


62  PASSAGES    IN 

practised  in  Canada  West)  is  by  torch  light ; 
although,  by  a  true  hunter  it  can  never  be 
regarded  as  altogether  legitimate  sport.  The 
darkest  portion  of  the  night  is  occupied  by  this 
description  of  deer  shooting,  which  has  its 
attractions  and  excitement,  as  well  as  the  other 
modes  of  securing  venison  "  to  use,  not  to 
abuse." 

The  hunter  having  elevated  a  lamp  in 
the  fore-part  of  a  canoe  or  skiff,  places 
himself  on  board,  with  a  sagacious  canoe-man 
at  the  stern,  who  perfectly  understands 
using  his  paddle,  without  making  the  least 
noise  to  alarm  the  deer.  Whilst  moving  slowly 
through  the  water,  along  the  shore,  the 
light  is  shaded  by  a  board  in  the  rear,  so  as 
to  throw  it  forward ;  this  places  the  hunter  in 
a  position  to  see  the  deer,  which  may  be  grazing, 
or  cooling  itself  among  the  water  lilies.  The 
deer  notices  nothing  but  the  light,  which  seems 
to  fascinate  him,  until  he  receives  the  contents 
of  the  rifle,  and  either  falls  in  the  water,  or 
leaves  his  bloody  trail  on  the  shore,  to  be  taken 
up  after  dawn. 

On  Sunday  morning  I  ascertained  that  there 
would  be  a  sermon,  in  a  school-house  at  the 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  63 

upper  settlement  of  the  Chateauguay  river, 
where  there  are  saw-mills,  and  I  walked  there, 
through  the  woods,  over  the  frozen  roads.  I 
reached  a  hamlet  of  wooden  houses,  and  found 
people,  respectably  dressed,  assembling  at  the 
school- house.  I  went  in  and  took  a  seat  on 
the  right  of  the  door,  but  had  not  been  long 
there,  when  a  man  came  from  the  other  side, 
and  shook  me  by  the  hand ;  with  difficulty  I 
recognised  Stores  the  hunter,  who  had  lost  his 
"  bush"  beard  on  donning  his,  "  go-to-meeting 
clothes."  He  said  "  you  are  among  the  women, 
sir."  I  asked  pardon  for  the  unintentional 
mistake,  and  moved  to  the  other  side. 

When  the  school-room  was  full,  and,  with  a 
large  stove  in  the  middle,  it  was  sufficiently 
close  for  the  admirers  of  confined  air.  I  was 
enjoying  a  broken  pane  near  me,  when  a  man 
came  in  "  ruminating"  tobacco,  and  soon  perceiv- 
ing the  defect  in  the  glass,  took  off  his  cap,  and 
with  it  closed  out  the  fresh  air.  There  was 
considerable  interest  excited  on  the  present 
occasion  of  meeting,  for  a  funeral  sermon  was 
about  to  be  delivered,  in  consequence  of  the 
sudden  demise  of  the  son  of  one  of  the  most 
respectable  settlers  of  the  place.  Afccr  a  long 


64  PASSAGES   IN 

pause,  an  old  man  entered  in  a  dark  green  coat, 
wearing  his  grizzled  hair  in  the  apostolic  style, 
blue  gloves  on  his  hands,  and  a  red  sash  about 
his  waist;  the  last  an  excellent  article  for 
comfort  and  support  in  travelling.  This  re- 
verend pastor  bore  in  his  hand  a  carpet-bag, 
containing  his  sermon,  &amp;c.,  and,  looking  de- 
liberately round  the  assemblage,  before  he 
mounted  to  the  desk  or  pulpit,  he  authoratively 
turned  out  certain  parties,  who  had  taken 
possession  of  two  or  three  seats  on  the  left  of 
the  pulpit,  and  then  directed  that  these  seats 
might  be  filled  by  the  father  and  the  female 
relations  of  the  young  deceased.  After  prayer, 
the  aged  minister  addressed  his  congregation  in 
a  sober,  earnest,  and  staid  manner.  "The 
Providence  of  God,  my  dear  friends,"  he  said, 
"  has  caused  us  to  assemble  here  this  morning. 
Two  weeks  ago,  when  the  father  of  brother 
Abner  was  in  my  house  in  sweet  sleep,  the  soul 
of  his  son  took  flight,  but  his  memory  is  not 
obliterated  here.  Brother  Miles  was  in  some 
way  prepared  for  the  blow  when  he  took  leave 
of  Abner,  who  went  to  Boston  for  the  benefit 
of  the  change  of  air,  and  for  advice,  but  from 
whence  he  never  returned.  My  texts  are  in 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  65 

12th  chapter  of  Ecclesiastes,  'Remember  thy 
Creator  in  the  days  of  thy  youth ;'  and  again, 
in  Job  the  14th  chapter,  '  Man  that  is  born  of  a 
woman  is  of  few  days,  and  full  of  trouble,'  If 
I  preach  to  you  now  from  these  texts,  it  is  in 
the  infirmity  of  the  flesh,  for  since  four  winters 
ago,  when  I  went  to  live  at  Malone,  I  have  not 
been  able  to  keep  my  health. 

"  Job,  my  friends,  had  many  afflictions ;  he 
thus  gained  experience  as  well  as  instruction  ; 
he  was  a  man  well  qualified  for  giving  instruc- 
tion ;  he  was  at  one  time  very  rich ;  the  first 
blow  fell  on  his  property,  then  his  children 
were  taken  away,  and  lastly,  his  health  being 
gone,  he  cried  out,  '  Have  pity  on  me.' 

"  First,  '  man  that  is  born  of  woman  is  of 
few  days ;'  years  are  not  mentioned,  but  days ; 
so  we  should  be  prepared  to  live  by  days,  and 
number  our  days.  Here  I  first  preached  to 
the  parents  of  some  of  those  assembled  before 
me.  My  congregation  consisted  of  fourteen, 
and  two  of  them  children."  Here  Stores  got 
up  and  opened  the  door  of  the  stove,  when  the 
minister  said,  "  I  wish  you  would  not  put  more 
in  there,"  when  Stores  answered,  "I  am  not

going  to ;"  and  certainly  I  found  the  heat  re- 
quired no  augmentation  to  it. 

"  Secondly,  '  His  days  are  full  of  trouble ;' 
more  diseases  fasten  on  man  than  on  all  brutes ; 
in  them,  diseases  are  not  in  so  many  forms  and 
shapes  as  in  the  human  family ;  with  the  rich 
and  with  the  poor,  it  is  a  continual  struggle 
with  the  King  of  Terrors,  and  we  see  the  strong 
and  the  weak  borne  down  in  the  struggle. 

"  Third,  '  He  cometh  forth  as  a  flower ;'  see 
how  many  efforts  are  now  made  in  our  villages 
to  cultivate  flowers;  but  did  you  ever  ask  a 
tender  mother  if  she  ever  gathered  flowers  that 
were  half  so  fragrant  as  a  child's  caress ;  but, 
as  Squire  Beaver  remarked,  what  a  change  may 
take  place  in  a  few  hours.  Odious  !  As  to  our 
deceased  brother,  he  was  always  willing  to 
oblige  me,  unworthy,  to  take  my  horse  and 
attend  to  my  comforts,  when  I  visited  at  his 
father's  house." 

Addressing  the  parents,  he  said,  "  If  Abner 
had  been  allowed  to  come  back  and  die,  it 
would  have  been  some  consolation;  and  now 
you  may  not  even  see  his  tomb ; — but  remem- 
ber, that  God  done  it.  God  has  taken  this  way 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  67 

to  show  that  we  should  not  devote  our  children 
entirely  to  the  world.  What  can  I  now  say; 
you  who  are  twined  about  my  heart,  are  you 
prepared  to  lay  down  the  body  to  be  devoured 
by  worms  and  reptiles?  This  affliction  ought 
to  make  you  more  attached  to  one  another. 
Tell  Jesus,  and  commit  your  sorrows  to  him. 
We  have  had  several  sudden  calls  before  this 
one.  First  was  a  gentleman  who  worked  in  a 
shoe-shop:  it  is  true  he  was  intemperate,  he 
drank,  went  a  little  way  from  the  house  and  cut 
his  throat.  The  little  boy  Bink  was  killed  by 
a  sheep  (commonly  considered  a  harmless 
animal)  on  his  way  to  school ;  another  little 
boy  was  playing  among  logs  in  the  Chateauguay, 
and  was  drowned;  and  a  young  man  you  all 
know,  was  killed  by  a  bear — a  lovely  youth  was 
James  !  All  this  should  teach  us  to  number  our 
days."  In  this  homely  style,  but  in  a  manner 
suited  to  his  country  audience,  did  the  old 
minister  address  them. 

After  this,  he  called  on  those  of  the  congrega- 
tion who  could  sing,  to  come  and  sit  together  and 
sing,  which  they  did  well ;  among  the  best  voices 
was  that  of  Stores,  who,  it  appeared,  was  not 
only  a  hunter  but  a  farmer,  and  had  kept  school 

F  2

for  sixteen  years ;  and  had  also  charge  of  the 
admirable  institution  in  the  Northern  States, 
the  district  library,  and  200  choice  volumes. 

Before  we  retire  from  this  interesting  region, 
we  will  now  shortly  describe,  from  original 
sources  of  information,  the  brilliant  achievement 
effected  in  the  last  American  war,  by  Canadian 
militia-men,  assisted  by  a  few  "  old  country 
men,"  in  defence  of  Canada,  on  the  Chateau- 
guay  river.  A  division  of  the  American  army, 
under  General  Hampton,  had  been  lying  at 
"  Four  Corners,"  and  was  waiting  for  the  descent 
of  the  St.  Lawrence  by  another  division,  General 
Wilkinson's,  so  as  jointly  to  fall  on  Montreal. 
Major- General  De  Wattville,  suspecting  the 
designs  of  General  Hampton,  was  on  the  alert  to 
frustrate  them.  On  the  21st  October,  1813, 
at  four,  P.M.,  the  Americans  moved,  and  their 
advanced  guard  drove  in  the  British  pickets, 
at  Piper's  road,  ten  leagues  above  Chateauguay 
church.  Major  Henry  gave  this  information  to 
General  De  Wattville,  who  immediately  ordered 
300  or  400  men  to  advance  up  the  Chateau- 
guay to  observe  the  enemy,  they  advanced  two 
leagues  to  a  wood,  and  halted  outside  of  it. 
Next  morning,  Lieut.-Colonel  De  Salabery,  a 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  69 

very  resolute  officer,  of  herculean  strength,  with 
his  voltigeurs,  and  Captain  Ferguson,  with  the 
light  company  of  the  Canadian  regiment,  joined 
the  first  party. 

Colonel  De  Salabery  next  moved  about  a 
league  to  the  other  side  of  the  wood;  and  a 
patrol  of  the  enemy's  having  been  observed,  he 
took  up  a  position  at  the  edge  of  the  wood  next 
them.  The  wood  was  intersected,  on  the  left  or 
north  bank  of  the  river,  with  ravines ;  and  on 
four  of  these  he  formed  lines  of  defence,  one 
behind  the  other.  The  three  first  lines  were 
about  200  yards  from  each  other.  The  fourth 
line  was  about  half-a-mile  in  the  rear,  and  com- 
manded a  ford  which,  for  the  safety  of  his  left 
flank,  it  was  very  necessary  to  watch.  He 
threw  up  breast-works  on  each  side  of  the  lines, 
which  extended  from  the  river,  and  some  dis- 
tance into  the  wood,  following  the  course  of  the 
ravines. 

The  right  bank  of  the  river  was  also  covered 
with  forest,  a  strong  guard  was  placed  at  the 
ford,  and  sixty  men  of  the  Beauharnois  militia 
were  posted,  as  a  picket,  in  advance.  The 
second  day,  Colonel  De  Salabery  sent  thirty 
axe-men  of  the  Beauharnois  division,  to  proceed

a  league  and  a  half  in  advance  of  the  first  line, 
and  destroy  the  bridges,  and  make  an  abattis  of 
felled  trees.  We  here  see  the  great  use  of  the 
axe,  instead  of  the  imperfect  bill-hook,  in  cam- 
paigning; a  2-lb.  or  3-lb.  axe,  with  a  long 
handle,  is  easily  carried,  and  is  of  the  greatest 
value  in  wooded  countries.*  A  formidable 
abattis  was  accordingly  made,  about  a  mile  in 
front  of  the  first  line,  and  extended  from  the 
river  to  a  swamp ;  thus  were  the  four  lines  as 
well  protected  as  the  time  and  the  means  allow- 
ed ;  and  the  enemy's  ten  pieces  of  cannon  ren- 
dered of  little  avail.  After  the  above  judicious 
arrangements  had  been  made,  General  De  Watt- 
ville  visited  the  lines,  and  approved  of  everything 
which  had  been  done  by  Colonel  De  Salabery, 
who,  like  a  careful  officer,  left  nothing  to  chance, 
but  took  every  needful  precaution. 

On  the  26th,  at  ten,  AM.,  an  advanced  corps 
of  the  enemy  came  within  fire  of  the  abattis, 
when  Lieut.  Guy,  of  the  voltigeurs,  with  twenty

in-the  use  of  the  all-powerful  axe,  and  of  entrenching  tools.

men  in  advance,  fell  back,  and  was  supported 
by  Lieut.  Johnstone  in  his  rear.  The  working 
party  engaged  in  improving  the  abattis,  laid 
aside  their  axes,  and  the  firing  immediately 
brought  Colonel  De  Salabery  to  the  front  with 
a  considerable  portion  of  his  force,  which  he 
thus  disposed  of:  Captain  Ferguson's  company, 
with  twenty  Indians,  extended  on  the  right, 
and  in  front  of  the  abattis.  Captain  J.  B. 
Duchesney's  company  in  the  centre,  and  Cap- 
tain J.  Duchesney's  company,  with  fifty  or 
sixty  of  the  Beauharnois  militia,  en  potence, 
(left  thrown  back)  on  the  river,  to  flank  and 
protect  the  Beauharnois  militia  on  the  right 
bank.  Between  the  abattis  and  first  line, 
were  Ecuyer's  company  of  voltigeurs,  and  Cap- 
tain Debartsh's  light  company  of  militia,  with 
their  flank  pickets  thrown  out  to  the  right ;  a 
large  body  of  Indians,  under  Captain  Lamothe, 
were  extended  on  the  road,  to  the  right  of 
Captain  Debartsh.  Colonel  MacDonnell,  of  the 
Glangarry  light  infantry  (distinguished  for  his 
most  gallant  attack  on  Ogdensburgh)  moved 
from  the  third  and  fourth  lines  to  the  first  and 
second,  and  all  these  dispositions  being  rapidly 
made,  the  British  force  awaited  the  appearance

of  the  enemy.  Among  other  worthy  gentlemen 
commanding  companies  on  the  occasion  of  the 
fight  of  Chateauguay,  Captain  Longtin  must 
not  be  overlooked.  He  knelt  down  with  his 
men  before  the  commencement  of  the  action, 
which  was  evidently  to  be  a  desperate  one, 
offered  up  a  short  and  fervent  prayer,  and  then 
said,  "As  you  have  now  done  your  duty  to 
your  God,  I  expect  you  will  also  do  your  duty 
to  your  King." 

The  Americans  now  issued  from  the  woods, 
and  began  to  form  on  a  large  plain  of  a 
triangular  shape  opposite  the  abattis,  General 
Hampton  commanded  there  in  person,  and  he 
had  with  him  the  10th  and  31st  regiments, 
and  other  corps,  three  squadrons  of  cavalry, 
and  four  guns ;  the  numerical  strength  was 
here  about  3,500  men,  with  a  reserve  in  the 
woods  in  the  rear,  whilst  1,500  men  of  the 
4th  and  33rd  regiments,  light  troops,  &amp;c., 
moved  down  through  the  forest  on  the  right 
bank  of  the  river. 

A  strong  column  of  infantry  now  advanced 
across  the  plain  towards  the  abattis.  Colonel 
De  Salabery  seeing  that  they  had  laid  them- 
selves open  to  a  front  and  flank  fire,  commenced 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  73 

the  fight,  by  shooting  a  mounted  officer  with 
his  own  hand,  and  then  ordered  the  bugle 
to  sound  "  commence  firing."  The  fire  from 
the  abattis  soon  brought  the  enemy  to  a  halt, 
they  deployed  and  answered  with  volleys ; 
those  towards  the  left  were  uselessly  expended 
in  the  woods,  but  their  fire  from  the  right 
being  effective,  obliged  the  British  skirmishers 
to  take  shelter  behind  the  abattis.  Huzzas 
then  issued  from  the  American  ranks  for 
assured  victory,  but  they  were  replied  to  from 
the  lines. 

Lieut.-Colonel  MacDonnell  caused  his  bugles 
to  sound  in  all  directions,  so  as  to  induce  the 
enemy  to  believe  that  thousands  instead  of 
hundreds  composed  the  British  force,  and  the 
fight  continued  amidst  clouds  of  smoke  and 
loud  cheering.  The  enemy's  fire  gradually 
slackened,  whilst  Colonel  MacDonnell  came  up 
to  the  front  to  assist  at  the  abattis. 

The  American  column  on  the  right  bank 
having  overwhelmed  the  Beauharnois  militia 
posted  there,  opened  a  fire  across  the  river  on 
the  British  left,  but  which  was  spiritedly  replied 
to.  Colonel  De  Salabery  now  ordered  Colonel 


74  PASSAGES    IN 

MacDonnell  to  send  a  company,  as  a  reinforce- 
ment, to  the  other  side  of  the  river,  and  Captain 
Daly  was  selected  for  this  service;  he  crossed 
at  the  ford  and  moved  rapidly  in  advance; 
Colonel  De  Salabery  then  mounted  the  stump 
of  a  large  tree,  to  reconnoitre,  and  gave  his 
directions  to  Captain  Daly  across  the  river 
in  French,  and  cautioned  him  to  answer  in  the 
same  language.  Captain  Daly  drove  back  the 
enemy,  who,  rallying  on  their  supports,  and  he 
being  twice  wounded,  his  men  fell  back  before 
an  overpowering  fire ;  the  enemy  coming  again 
opposite  the  British,  who  were  en  potence  on 
the  left  bank,  Colonel  De  Salabery  threw  in  so 
heavy  a  fire  on  their  flank  that  they  retreated 
with  precipitation,  leaving  twenty  prisoners  with 
Captain  Daly's  party,  forty  dead  on  the  ground, 
(the  wounded  were  carried  off;)  muskets,  drums, 
knapsacks,  provisions,  &amp;c.  General  Hampton 
now  withdrew  his  whole  force ;  and  the  victors, 
who  lost  about  two-score  men,  slept  on  the 
ground  they  had  disputed  so  gallantly,  and  for 
which  a  medal  has  been  deservedly  granted. 
Next  day  the  retreating  enemy  was  followed  for 
a  considerable  distance  with  light  troops  and 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  75 

Indian  warriors,  and  General  Hampton  did  not 
renew  his  attempt  to  penetrate  into  Lower 
Canada. 

The  enemy's  force  though  numbering  7,000 
infantry,  400  cavalry,  and  ten  guns,  was  thus 
effectually  repulsed  by  300  on  the  side  of  the 
British,  which  was  the  number  actually  under 
fire.  Of  those  300,  (to  their  great  credit  be 
it  recorded)  almost  all  were  Canadian  born, 
except  Captain  Ferguson,  three  other  officers 
and  three  men.  The  remainder  of  the  British 
force  was  in  support  and  in  reserve  at  the 
judiciously-constructed  lines,  which,  with  the 
abattis,  demonstrated  clearly  the  great  advan- 
tages derived  from  the  use  of  the  axe  and 
entrenching  tools. 

But  it  is  time  to  return  to  Montreal  after  a 
successful  hunt,  and  to  close  this  desultory 
account  of  Deer  Driving,  and  other  matters,  in 
a  region  whose  name  recalls  proud  recollections 
to  the  sons  of  "  the  land  of  the  beaver  and 
maple  leaf." 

Lord  Palmerston  once  well  remarked, 
"  There  is  no  fortification  like  brave  men, 
armed,  organized,  and  ready  to  meet  an  enemy  ;" 
and  few,  except  the  worthies  of  the  Peace 


76  PASSAGES    IN 

Society,  will  be  inclined  to  dispute  this.  Every 
right-thinking  man  values  the  countless  bless- 
ings of  peace ;  but  these  cannot  be  long  enjoyed, 
whilst  so  little  of  the  angelic  nature  exists  in 
this  sublunary  scene,  unless  the  possessors  of 
these  blessings  demonstrate  that  they  will  not, 
without  strong  opposition,  allow  their  privileges 
to  be  invaded. 

We  see  on  the  Continent  of  Europe,  we  see 
in  America,  the  youth  accustomed  to  arms ; 
this  does  not  continually  lead  to  a  reckless  and 
wicked  resort  to  deadly  weapons,  unless  the  oc- 
casion demands  it ;  but  it  gives  confidence  and 
a  feeling  of  security  to  those  who  possess  a 
knowledge  of  arms,  and  also  to  the  peaceful 
citizens,  where  such  knowledge  exists.  There 
need  be  no  panics,  no  fear  of  invasion,  if  in 
every  town  and  village  of  our  beloved  native 
land,  encouragement  is  given  to  manly  exercises, 
and  among  others  to  the  use  of  the  rifle. 

Our  cousins  the  Americans,  once  foes,  and 
now,  we  trust,  for  ever  friends  (if  travellers  and 
writers  would  only  view  with  an  eye  of  charity 
the  peculiarities  of  the  respective  countries) 
have  been  long  distinguished  for  their  apprecia- 
tion of  the  value  of  the  rifle,  and  for  their  skill 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  77 

in  its  use.  To  dive  into  the  arcana  of  rifle 
shooting,  as  practised  in  America,  I  associated 
myself  with  some  American  riflemen,  and  join- 
ed a  club  for  practice.  The  Montreal  Rifle 
Club  afforded  hints  for  the  formation  of  other 
rifle  clubs,  and  showed  with  what  facility  rifle 
practice  can  be  carried  on.  "  Sharpshooting" 
is  the  fashion  of  the  day,  and  the  more  it  is 
practised,  and  the  game  of  war  made  more 
dangerous,  the  sooner  will  arrive  the  blessed 
reign  of  "  universal  peace  and  good-will "  over 
the  whole  earth. 

The  Montreal  Rifle  Club  was  not  numerous, 
and  a  moderate  subscription  of  a  few  dollars 
brought  it  into  existence,  and  enabled  it,  under 
the  able  direction  of  its  secretary,  Mr.  A. 
Murray,  and  other  zealous  members,  to  con- 
tinue its  practice  over  the  ice  of  the  St.  Law- 
rence in  winter.  "A  shooting  shanty"  of 
frame-work  was  erected  at  the  edge  of  the  ice, 
the  dimensions  were  twenty-four  feet  long,  ten 
wide,  ten  feet  high  at  the  back,  eight  feet  in 
front  (two  feet  of  slope).  It  was  divided  into 
two  apartments  ;  in  the  inner  were  two  good 
sized  glazed  windows  at  the  front  and  gable, 
shelf-tables  all  round  for  facility  of  loading, 


78  PASSAGES    IN 

cleaning,  &amp;c.,  and  a  small  stove.  In  the  outer 
apartment  (the  door  of  entrance  being  in  the 
gable)  were  a  form  for  sitting  on,  seventeen  and 
a  half  inches  high,  a  rest,  made  somewhat  like 
a  carpenter's  tressel,  with  four  legs,  and  a  nar- 
row table  at  top,  its  dimensions  were  four  feet 
six  inches  long,  thirty-six  inches  high  in  front, 
thirty -three  in  rear,  the  top  ten  inches  wide ; 
there  was  a  moveable  block,  nicked  at  top,  to 
rest  the  rifle  on,  nine  inches  high,  and  sloping 
pieces  of  board,  as  rests  for  the  elbows,  twelve 
and  nine  inches,  a  flat  board  hollowed  out  for 
the  chest  and  nailed  to  the  table ;  the  whole, 
with  the  form,  a  complete  rest,  and  described  in 
that  excellent  work  "  Chapman  on  the  Rifle." 

The  chief  use  of  this  rest  is  to  prove  one's 
rifle,  also  for  matches  with  the  rest;  a  good 
rifleman  should  be  able  to  shoot  with  or  without 
a  rest,  or  "  off  hand"  as  the  American  term  is  ; 
still  it  would  be  foolish  not  to  avail  oneself  of  a 
rest  when  it  offers,  as  much  as  of  cover.  The 
outer  apartment  of  our  shanty  was  open,  waist 
high,  and  a  shutter  let  down  closed  it  when  no 
longer  required  for  practice.  A  shooting  shanty 
may  be  put  up  for  £20,  and  it  may  be  move- 
able. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  79 

The  targets  were  of  square  boards  on  one 
leg ;  on  each  board  was  tacked  a  sheet  of 
blue  paper  1 8  inches  square  ;  on  it  was  a  white 
patch,  9  inches  in  diameter,  with  a  bull's-eye  in 
the  centre.  The  targets  were  set  up  in  the 
snow  at  the  distances  of  75,  110,  220,  and 
440  yards.  Small  pennons  on  sticks  along  the 
line  of  fire  warned  intruders  from  danger.  No 
one  had  been  hurt  during  the  club's  existence. 
The  markers  stood  well  at  one  side,  or  they 
were  dispensed  with  altogether  by  using  a 
telescope  from  the  shanty. 

The  weight  of  the  rifles  generally  used 
varied,  of  course,  with  the  purpose  to  which  the 
weapon  was  to  be  applied,  and  ranged  from  the 
hunting  gun  of  from  8  to  12  pounds,  to  the 
heaviest  target  gun  (such  as  I  had  seen  used  in 
the  Tyrol),  which  sometimes  reached  20  pounds. 
Regarding  the  length  of  the  barrel  similar 
remarks  apply,  and  this  also  is  much  a  matter 
of  fancy.  As  a  general  rule,  however,  the 
long  barrels  which  were  for  many  years 
employed  by  the  Western  hunters,  are  now 
abandoned,  it  being  found  that  the  increasing 
or  "  gain  twist,"  as  it  is  termed  in  rifling,  gives 
to  a  short  barrel  the  power  of  producing  even 


80  PASSAGES    IN 

a  more  rapid  revolution  of  the  ball  upon  its 
axis,  and  with  much  less  friction,  than  could  be 
accomplished  with  length  of  barrel  with  the 
even  twist.  It  may  be  mentioned  that  the 
degree  of  increasing  spiral  from  breech  to 
muzzle,  varies  with  the  length  of  barrel, 
increasing  more  rapidly  as  the  barrel  is  made 
shorter.  Very  close  practice,  at  from  200  to 
300  yards,  can  be  made  with  the  Wesson 
pistol,  which  bolts  to  a  gun-stock,  and  the 
barrel  of  which  is  but  twelve  inches  in  length. 
A  very  handy  and  short  rifled  carbine,  to  load 
at  the  breech,  which  I  got  some  years  ago  from 
my  old  and  esteemed  friend,  the  well  known 
maitre-d'armes,  Captain  John  Norton,  and 
which  I  carried  in  the  interior  of  Africa,  had  a 
range  of  240  yards,  and  answered  admirably  for 
creeping  after  wild  animals  to  slay  for  food, 
and  not  for  mere  sport. 

The  sights  employed  by  the  M.  R.  club  were 
either  open,  globe  and  bead,  or  telescopic — 
the  globe  and  bead  being  those  in  general  use. 
The  globe-sight  screws  into  the  stock,  just 
behind  the  break-off,  and  is  made  of  steel ;  it  is 
a  circular  plate  (not  a  globe,  though  so  called) 
about  three-quarters  of  an  inch  in  diameter, 


THE   LIFE   OF   A    SOLDIER.  81 

with  a  small  hole  through  the  centre,  counter 
sunk  on  each  side,  to  avoid  reflection,  and  is 
mounted  on  a  stalk  about  two  inches  in  length, 
and  cut  with  a  thread  about  sixty-four  turns  to 
the  inch.  The  bead-sight  is  so  called  from  its 
peculiarity  of  shape,  a  bead  about  half  the  size 
of  a  pin's  head  is  filed  on  a  piece  of  steel-wire, 
and  the  stalk  left  as  flat  and  thin  as  possible. 
This  stands  up  about  three-sixteenths  of  an 
inch  from  the  barrel  at  the  muzzle,  and  is 
shaded  by  a  thimble  about  three-eighths  of  an 
inch  in  diameter,  and  one  inch  long.  The 
bead,  stalk,  and  thimble,  are  attached  to  a  piece 
of  bevelled  steel,  which  slides  along  a  dovetail, 
cut  across  the  barrel,  about  one-twelfth  of  an 
inch  in  depth,  and  three-eighths  wide ;  a  point 
filed  on  the  front  end  of  the  thimble  shows  how 
many  divisions  of  the  index  the  sight  has  been 
removed  from  the  centre.  The  index  is  cut  on 
the  top  of  the  barrel,  and  is  divided  into  1-3 2nd 
of  an  inch.  By  elevating  or  depressing  the 
globe-sight  by  means  of  its  screw,  and  moving 
to  the  right  or  left  the  bead-sight,  any  required 
allowance  can  readily  be  made  for  length  of 
range  and  cross  wind.

The  ball  used  was  the  flat  ended  picket  or 
conical  bullet,  solid ;  which  after  being  cast  is 
pressed  by  the  blows  of  a  mallet  or  small  ham- 
mer, in  a  steel  matrix,  termed  a  "  swedge,"  in 
order  that  perfect  uniformity  of  surface  may  be 
secured :  the  conical  balls  for  the  winning  rifle 
weighed  about  forty-five  to  the  pound. 

The  powder  used  for  these  rifles  was  made 
expressly  for  the  purpose,  and  chiefly  by  Colonel 
Hazard,  and  is  characterized  by  mildness,  mo- 
derate strength,  evenness  in  grain,  and  the 
residuum  a  sulphuret  of  potash  very  soluble  in 
water;  quick-firing,  strong  powders,  of  which 
the  components  are  very  pure,  do  not  answer 
well  for  American  rifles.  The  grains  appear  to 
ignite  too  rapidly,  and  the  residuum  cakes  very 
hard  upon  the  bore  at  the  breech  end,  requiring 
much  moisture  to  loosen  it,  an  evil  to  be  avoid- 
ed as  much  as  posible.  The  Hazard  "  sea-fowl 
powder"  on  trial  by  a  powder  proof,  in  strength, 
compared  with  the  Government  powder  for 
small-arms,  is  as  five  to  nine. 

Men  trained  to  use  the  globe  sight  at  long 
ranges,  say  from  250  to  1,000  yards,  would  be 
well  adapted  to  disperse  artillerymen,  or  recon- 
noitring parties,  or  to  annoy  columns  ad- 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER. 

vancing  to  attack.  Musketry  at  such  distance 
is  perfectly  harmless,  but  every  bullet  from  a 
rifle  of  this  description,  in  well  trained  hands, 
tells.  If  objection  be  made  to  the  little  ad- 
ditional time  required  to  load  rifles,  still  the  su- 
perior accuracy  of  aim  fully  compensates  for  the 
loss  of  time,  and  if  the  bore  be  pretty  well 
"freed,"  20  to  30  shots  may  be  fired  in  suc- 
cession without  requiring  to  wipe  out  the  gun. 

The  main  points  of  the  American  rifle  and 
practice,  were  weight  of  metal,  comparatively 
small  bore,  with  the  increasing  or  gain  twist, 
heavy  charges  and  scrupulous  care  in  loading  to 
secure  uniformity,  and  maintain  the  ball  true 
alike  in  its  shape  and  position  in  the  gun; 
while  the  prevailing  practice  in  England  and 
the  continent  was  large  calibre  and  a  com- 
paratively light,  short  barrel,  with  a  quick  twist, 
with  about  one  turn  in  three  feet,  sometimes 
using  a  patch  and  sometimes  not,  the  ball 
spherical,  and  the  front  part  almost  invariably 
flattened  by  starting  and  driving  home. 

It  is  startling  to  look  through  the  telescope- 
sight  of  an  American  rifle,  which  resembles  a 
walking-cane  laid  on  the  barrel.  In  taking 
aim  at  a  pigeon  on  a  distant  roof,  for  example,

the  breast  of  the  poor  unconscious  bird  is  seen 
most  distinctly  crossed  by  the  wires  in  the 
field-glass,  and  its  destruction  seems  certain 
with  a  rest.  It  is  cruel  to  touch  a  trigger  or 
"  draw  a  bead"  at  a  living  object,  merely  to 
show  one's  sleight-of-hand. 

It  is  considered  that  the  relative  value  of 
rifles  may  be  viewed  under  these  heads : — first, 
safety  in  firing ;  second  certainty  of  not  miss- 
ing fire ;  third,  facility  of  loading ;  fourth,  sim- 
plicity of  construction ;  fifth,  rain  or  unfavour- 
able weather  not  interfering  with  their  execu- 
tion; sixth,  keeping  clean  by  their  own  dis- 
charges— say  with  tallowed  balls,  groved. 

Besides  assisting  at  the  Montreal  Rifle  Club, 
we  saw  also  in  the  Forest  what  American  rifles 
can  do  against  deer,  the  small  but  solid  conical 
ball,  of  which  150  could  be  carried  with  ease, 
going  right  through  the  light-footed  harts.  We 
hope  to  see  more  attention  paid,  generally,  in 
England  to  target  practice,  whether  with  rifle  or 
smooth  barrel,  than  there  has  been,  and  that 
rifle  corps  or  clubs  may  be  formed  in  many 
parts  of  Great  Britain  and  her  colonies,  and 
prizes  given  by  Government.  Archery  meet- 
ings are  very  pretty,  no  doubt,  but  useless,

except  for  contributing  to  the  amusements  of 
"  the  fair  Foresters."  We  should  admit  of  no 
inferiority  in  any  respect  in  the  "  wars  of  the 
giants.'"  Development  of  muscle,  also,  on  half- 
holidays,  should  be  extensively  patronized  in 
this  age,  which  is  apt  to  become  too  sedentary 
and  effeminate. 

On  the  Plains  of  Abraham,  a  pillar,  sur- 
mounted by  a  bronze  helmet  and  sword,  and 
lately  erected  by  the  army  of  Canada,  records 
that  there  the  heroic  Wolfe  "  died  victorious." 
The  poet  Cowper  well  says  of  his  native  land, — 

"Praise  and  boast  enough 
In  every  clime,  and  travel  where  we  might ; 
That  we  were  born  her  children.     Praise  enough 
To  fill  the  ambition  of  a  private  man, 
That  Chatham's  language  was  his  mother  tongue, 
And  Wolfe's  great  name  compatriot  with  his  own." 

From  this  scene  of  conflict,  honourable 
to  both  sides  who  contended  for  victory  in 
September,  1759,  we  are  instructed  by  the 
gallant  conduct  of  the  Highland  regiments  on 
that  occasion,  how  to  deal  with  riflemen  or 
troops,  posted  and  galling  with  their  fire  under 
the  screen  of  woods.  The  right  of  the  French 
line  was  under  cover,  and  doing  good  service,

when  a  portion  of  the  Highlanders  on  the 
British  left,  were  ordered  by  Brigadier  Murray 
to  cease  firing,  sling  their  fusils,  and  charge 
home  with  their  broadswords, — not  probably 
these  unwieldy  hilted  weapons  we  now  see,  but 
those  with  equally  balanced  blade  and  light  bas- 
ket hilt  which  figured  in  the  old  Scottish  fights. 
The  Highlanders  with  alacrity  obeyed  the  sum- 
mons, and,  followed  by  their  supports,  they  drove, 
with  their  flashing  blades,  their  foes  to  the  gates 
of  Quebec.

American  Watering-place— Fort  Hamilton — The  celebration 
of  Independence — Lord  Elgin  revisits  Montreal — Fancy 
Dress  Ball — A  Mountain  Boulevard  proposed — Attack  of  a 
Snow  Fort  —  Model  Commanding  Officers — Temperance

IN  the  summer  of  1850,  I  had  occasion  to 
take  my  small  family  to  the  sea-side,  and  we 
selected  Fort  Hamilton,  near  New  York,  "for 
change  of  air,  travelling  with  the  Honorable 
Mrs.  Dyneley  and  family,  also,  by  way  of  the 
glorious  Hudson,  and  tarrying  for  a  time  at  a 
large  hotel  occupied  by  well  dressed  visitors. 
The  accommodations  were  good  as  was  also  the 
fare,  we  were  driven  about  in  the  neighbourhood 


88  PASSAGES    IN 

of  Fort  Hamilton,  by  some  new  and  kind 
friends,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Hoge  of  New  York, 
and  visited  Coney  Island,  which  proved  "  a 
mistake;"  it  is  a  dreary  looking  place,  not  at 
all  fashionable,  but  with  good  bathing. 

We  were  in  New  York,  staying  with  our 
valued  friends  the  Misses  MacLeod,  at  the 
celebration  of  Independence,  the  fourth  of  July, 
when  there  was  a  remarkable  turn  out  of  the 
City  train-bands  on  the  occasion,  well  worth 
seeing,  some  thousands  of  Citizen  soldiers, 
many  of  them,  no  doubt,  capital  marksmen,  as 
they  don't  neglect  target  practice ;  but  arrayed 
in  every  variety  of  costume,  some  quite  thea- 
trical in  their  style.  Every  Captain  had  dressed 
his  company  according  to  his  own  taste,  or 
theirs,  and  it  was  surprising  to  behold  in  one 
place,  the  black  bear  skins  and  red  coats  of  Her 
Majesty's  Foot  Guards,  then  kilted  Highlanders 
in  all  the  bravery  of  ostrich  plumes  and  belted 
plaids — followed  by  soldiers  of  the  days  of  the 
Revolution,*  in  three-cornered  cocked  hats,  broad 
skirted  coats,  buff  vests,  and  breeches  and  top 
boots  ;  the  most  sensible  and  soldier-like  dress  of 
all,  was  that  of  the  grey  riflemen  in  tunics,  and 
*  The  Continentals  of  1776. 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  89 

with  black  and  bronze  belts  and  appointments. 
There  was  an  immense  expenditure  of  gun- 
powder, not  only  by  boys,  but  by  grown  men,  in 
the  streets,  and  from  their  houses;  and  the 
sticks  of  numerous  rockets,  descending  from 
their  aerial  flight,  occasioned  some  accidents. 
The  battle  raged  all  day,  accompanied  with 
great  noise,  and  "  the  loud  smell  of  powder  all 
around." 

We  returned  to  Canada  by  the  route  made 
classic  by  Cooper  in  "  the  Last  of  the  Mohicans  ;" 
passed  "Bloody  Pond,"  so  named  from  100 
British  Grenadiers  having  been  thrown  into  it 
after  a  fight  there,  swam  in  the  pure  waters  of 
the  beautiful  Lake  George,  and  visited  Fort 
Ticonderoga  where  600  of  my  late  regiment, 
the  42nd  R.H.,  fell  in  the  old  American  war,  in 
repeated  attempts  to  scale  the  steep  turf 
parapets,  without  ladders. 

Observing  that  the  celebrated  Scottish  vo- 
calist, John  Wilson,  an  old  acquaintance,  had 
arrived  in  the  States,  I  wrote  to  invite  him  to 
Canada.  He  came,  and  was  very  successful ;  but 
imprudently  fishing  on  a  hot  summer's  day  at 
Lake  Charles,  near  Quebec,  and  partaking  of 
iced  milk,  he  was  seized  with  cholera  and  died.

A  few  of  his  countrymen  erected  to  his  memory, 
in  the  beautiful  Mount  Hermon  Cemetery, 
overlooking  the  St.  Lawrence,  a  solid  and 
appropriate  monument  over  his  remains ;  whilst 
the  breeze  in  the  pine  trees  there  sing  his 
dirge. 

The  tumults  which  took  place  at  Montreal, 
some  time  after  the  Earl  of  Elgin  had  assumed 
the  reins  of  Government,  have  been  described. 
There  was  a  remarkable  reconciliation  of  the 
contending  parties  in  the  end  of  1851,  which 
we  witnessed  after  returning  from  a  visit 
to  Europe.  His  Excellency  had  assisted  at 
Boston,  at  a  great  Jubilee,  at  which  many 
of  the  British  were  present,  the  Mayor  and 
Corporation  of  Montreal  were  there,  and  asked 
Lord  Elgin  to  revisit  their  city,  and  they  hoped 
that  what  had  passed  would  be  forgotten.  His 
Excellency  consented,  and  there  was  a  great 
gathering  at  Hayes'  House  (hotel),  when  speeches 
were  made,  and  hands  shaken  all  round.  After 
this,  I  went,  by  invitation  of  the  Directors  of  the 
St.  Lawrence  and  Atlantic  rail-road,  to  Mel- 
bourne, where  his  Lordship,  at  a  monster 
dinner,  commemorated  the  opening  of  the  line 
so  far  on  its  way  to  Portland,  since  which  it 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  91 

has   been   in   successful  operation,    under  the 
all-powerful  influence  of  the  steam  horse. 

On— on— on — with  a  haughty  front, 

A  puff,  a  shriek  and  a  bound; 
While  the  tardy  echoes  wake  too  late 

To  babble  back  the  sound. 

Beside  the  ordinary  balls  at  Montreal  in  the 
winter,  there  was  a  fancy  dress  ball  in  1851, 
the  preparations  for  which  excited  considerable 
interest  in  the  community,  as  it  was  the  first 
that  had  taken  place  for  some  years. 

It  was  held  at  Donegana's  Hotel,  and 
300  people  were  present  at  it.  There  was 
a  well  dressed  poudre  quadrille  of  the  time 
of  George  II.  The  powdered  hair,  and  the 
mouches  coquettishly  placed  on  the  face, 
were  most  becoming  to  the  ladies.  The 
gentlemen  were  correctly  dressed  as  soldiers 
or  civilians  of  the  same  period.  Other  ladies, 
not  in  the  poudre  quadrille,  personated  "  Night" 
and  "  Morning ;"  one  lady  wore  a  costume  of 
the  time  of  the  Crusades,  and  there  were  the 
usual  Swiss  and  Tyrolese  peasants,  Italians, 
Spaniards,  Vivandieres,  Greeks  and  Turks, 
in  a  room  decorated  with  silken  banners,  and 


92  PASSAGES    IN 

glittering  with  stars  of  ramrods,  bayonets,  and 
sabres. 

In  the  following  spring,  seeing  the  great 
capabilities  for  the  formation  of  a  fine  Boulevard 
and  drive,  shaded  with  trees,  round  the  upper 
part  of  the  Montreal  mountain,  where  the 
purest  air  could  be  enjoyed,  (this  so  called 
mountain  raising  its  massive  and  wooded  sides 
behind  the  city,  and  commanding  splendid  views 
of  the  St.  Lawrence,  the  great  plain  beyond, 
scattered  hills  of  picturesque  outline,  and  the 
mountains  of  Vermont  in  the  far  distance),  I 
occupied  myself  at  various  times  in  surveying 
the  mountain,  and  making  plans  for  an  80  feet 
Boulevard.  A  public  meeting  was  called,  to 
discuss  what  would  tend  so  much  to  the  health, 
comfort  and  happiness  of  the  community,  the 
Honorable  Peter  MacGill  being  in  the  chair, 
and  among  those  who  took  the  deepest  interest 
in  the  undertaking  was  Mr.  J.  J.  Day,  an 
Alderman.  We  hope  that  this,  which  would  be 
the  finest  drive  and  promenade  in  North 
America,  the  mountain  Boulevard  at  Montreal, 
will  not  be  lost  sight  of  by  the  city  authorities. 

In  the  course  of  my  mountain  rambles, 
sometimes  on  snow  shoes,  I  remarked  how  well 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  93 

adapted  a  portion  of  the  front  of  the  mountain 
was  for  the  formation  of  a  public  terraced 
garden,  whilst  behind  the  mountain  was  a 
secluded  and  romantic  valley,  with  a  stream 
of  water,  and  well  fitted  for  a  cemetery.  This 
has  been  subsequently  purchased  and  enclosed 
for  a  cemetery,  and  it  already  contains  many 
handsome  monuments  on  the  grassy  slopes,  and 
beside  the  shady  walks.  Of  those  gentlemen 
who  took  the  greatest  interest  in  this  important 
object,  was  the  excellent  Judge  McCord. 

In  the  month  of  March,  1852,  we  had  a 
little  military  display  and  instruction  in  the 
shape  of  an  attack  on  a  snow  Fort,  Captain 
Eveleigh  (since  distinguished  in  the  Crimea 
as  Lieut-Colonel  Eveleigh,  K.L.H.  and  C.B.) 
with  the  Grenadiers  of  the  20th  regiment 
stationed  at  the  fortified  Barracks  on  St. 
Helen's  Island,  opposite  Montreal,  (beautiful  in 
summer,  with  its  fine  trees,  and  the  broad 
stream  running  swiftly  past  it,  and  in  winter 
connected  with  the  mainland  by  a  massive  table 
of  ice)  having  been  directed  to  construct  and 
defend  a  snow  Fort,  it  was  done  by  connecting 
with  a  curtain  of  snow  a  battery  on  the  west 
end  of  the  island,  with  a  square  redoubt  in  the 


94  PASSAGES   IN 

rear.  A  couple  of  guns  manned  by  the  Royal 
Artillery  were  mounted  on  the  work,  and 
Infantry  lined  the  parapets. 

On  the  4th  of  March,  the  day  being 
favourable  for  assaulting  the  Fort,  a  strong 
party  of  the  20th,  under  Major  Crofton,  moved 
from  the  barracks  at  an  early  hour,  with 
scaling  ladders,  over  the  ice  of  the  St.  Lawrence, 
and  took  up  a  position  on  the  Island,  out  of 
sight  of  the  Fort.  At  1 1  A.M.  another  column 
marched  out  covered  by  skirmishers  on  snow 
shoes,  this  was  the  false  attack.  A  part  of  the 
garrison  under  Lieut.  Rotheram,  with  two  guns 
on  sleigh  runners,  commanded  by  Captain 
Gardiner,  R.A.,  now  met  the  assailants  under 
Commandant  Horn*  on  the  ice,  and  attempted 
to  drive  them  back,  but  being  repulsed,  after 
much  firing,  the  real  attack  took  place,  the 
storming  party  and  supports  rushing  from  their 
ambuscade  under  Lord  Mark  Kerr,  dashing 
through  the  abattis  of  boughs,  plunging  into 
the  ditch,  planting  the  ladders  and  scaling  the 
walls. 

After  the  British  colours  had  been  hoisted  on 

*  Afterwards  Brigadier-General,  and  wounded  at  Inker- 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  95 

the  highest  part  of  the  Fort,  three  cheers  were 
given  for  the  achievement,  which  was  wit- 
nessed by  General  Rowan,  and  numerous  spec- 
tators from  the  city.  It  was  an  animating  sight, 
and  the  weather  "  though  frosty  was  kindly." 

It  is  highly  useful  "  to  make  a  break"  fre- 
quently during  military  service,  and  to  get  up 
instructive  amusements  like  the  above,  along 
with  the  constant  practise  of  gymnastics  in  the 
open  air,  of  an  afternoon,  in  summer,  and  in  a 
salle  d'armes  in  winter,  in  a  climate  like  that  of 
Canada. 

A  commanding  officer  will  find  it  materially 
to  the  advantage  of  his  regiment,  and  that  it 
will  help  to  check  desertion,  if  he  has  always 
something  in  prospect  for  his  men,  besides  the 
usual  military  duties,  which  are  the  first  and 
primary  consideration,  of  course.  If  the  ser- 
vice becomes  a  dull  routine,  it  will  be  engaged 
in  with  as  little  zeal  as  that  displayed  by  a 
cavalry  officer,  who  was  made  a  Major  one  day ; 
after  a  time  a  friend  said : 

"  I  hear  you  are  going  to  leave." 

"  Yes,"  answered  the  other,  "  it's  too  much 
for  me,  they  wanted  to  make  a  Colonel  of  me, 


96  PASSAGES    IN 

I  consented  to  be  a  Major,  that's  easy,  but  a 
Colonel  would  be  too  much  of  a  bore." 

There  was  an  officer  serving  in  Canada,  who 
seemed  to  me  to  be  a  pattern  commanding 
officer,  the  late  Colonel  Sir  Charles  Chichester, 
8 1st  Regiment;  very  attentive  to  his  duties 
himself,  and  seeing  that  others  were  so  also,  he 
took  care  to  instruct  those  under  him,  and  kept 
them  always  usefully  occupied.  He  promoted 
their  interests  in  every  possible  manner,  and 
was  really  the  father  of  his  regiment ;  thus, 
when  he  saw  that  an  officer  displayed  zeal,  and 
by  his  acquirements  was  qualified  for  the  staff, 
Sir  Charles,  instead  of  selfishly  retaining  him 
with  the  regiment,  endeavoured  to  get  a  staff 
appointment  for  the  qualified  and  deserving 
officer.  He  caused  those  officers  who  were  able 
to  do  it,  to  lecture  on  military  subjects,  and  in 
the  winter,  snow  forts  were  constructed  and 
attacked,  in  a  similar  manner  to  what  we  have 
just  described. 

On  one  occasion,  when  Sir  Charles  was  head- 
ing an  attack  himself,  he  was  knocked  down  in 
the  ditch  with  a  piece  of  frozen  snow  from  the 
parapet,  and  he  called  out  to  those  who  stooped 
to  assist  him, 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  97 

"Never  mind  me,  men,  scramble  over  the 
dead  bodies !" 

He  had  no  desertion  from  his  regiment,  even 
on  the  frontier,  thus  proving  the  excellence  of 
the  system  he  pursued,  and  which  he  continued, 
till  his  death  by  liver  complaint,  caused  by  long 
service  in  hot  climates. 

Sir  Duncan  Macdougal,  Colonel  of  the  79th 
Highlanders,  in  Canada,  was  a  commanding 
officer  of  the  first  class.  With  extraordinary 
energy  and  zeal,  he  kept  every  one  on  the  alert, 
and  his  regiment  had  a  particularly  dashing  look 
about  it.  Whilst  he  was  most  liberal  of  his 
own  money,  he  took  every  care  of  the  pockets 
of  his  officers,  and  would  not  for  a  moment 
tolerate  debt. 

We  had  the  well-known  Barnum  at  Mon- 
treal, with  Tom  Thumb,  and  a  menagerie*  of 
wild  beasts;  he  also  lectured  on  Temperance 
and  the  Maine  Liquor  Law.  A  specimen  of 
his  style  may  be  given.  He  is  a  Connecticut 
man  ;  in  appearance  he  is  tall  and  robust,  with 
a  round  head,  square  face,  short  nose,  an  intelli- 
gent, but  severe  expression,  hair  not  lanky,  but 
cut  even  all  round  the  head.  Coming  forward 
to  the  front  of  the  platform,  "  in  a  genteel  suit

of  black,"  and  holding  his  hands  together  with 
his  fingers  touching,  he  said : 

"  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  am  happy  to  be 
here  to  contribute  a  little  mite  to  the  cause  of 
temperance ;  no  doubt  curiosity  brings  jnany 
here  this  evening,  so  would  a  trial  for  murder. 
If  in  your  streets  a  man  had  robbed  and  mur- 
dered half-a-dozen  citizens,  there  would  be  a 
great  attendance  to  see  him  tried ;  however, 
whatever  may  be  the  motive  for  your  coming 
here,  I  hope  that  the  result  will  be  for  good, 
though  at  the  mouth  of  him  who  exhibited 
Jenny  Lind,  and  Tom  Thumb,  the  mermaid, 
and  the  woolly  horse. 

"  There  was  a  toll  at  a  bridge  over  a  river,  and 
when  the  stage  came  to  it,  if  there  was  any 
delay,  the  driver  swore  terribly,  and  the  passen- 
gers, though  annoyed,  said,  *  it  does  not  concern 
us.'  So  with  passengers  on  a  voyage  across  the 
Atlantic,  ;f  they  are  awoke  in  the  night  with  the 
cry  of  the  '  ship's  on  fire !'  one  might  answer 
'  it  does  not  concern  me ;'  but  we  are  univer- 
sally interested  in  temperance. 

"  I  drank  a  great  deal  once  myself,  but  I  now 
see  it  is  a  universal  evil,  and  that  the  best  man 
in  society,  the  most  social,  generous,  liberal, 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  99 

falls  by  the  infatuation  of  liquor.  The  parsi- 
monious man  is  too  mean  to  get  drunk. 

"  An  Irishman  used  to  come  home  often 
drunk,  and  once  when  he  was  watering  his 
horse,  his  wife  said  to  him,  'Now,  Paddy,  is 
not  that  baste  an  example  to  ye,  don't  you  see 
he  laves  off  when  he  has  had  enough,  the  cray- 
tur  !  he's  the  most  sensible  baste  of  the  two.' 
'  Oh,  it's  very  well  to  discoorse  like  that,  Biddy,' 
cried  Paddy,  '  but  if  there  was  another  horse 
at  the  other  side  of  the  trough  to  say — here's 
your  health,  my  ould  boy^ !  would  he  stop  till  he 
drunk  the  whole  trough,  think  ye  ?' 

"  Drunkenness  does  not  only  affect  one's  self, 
but  also  one's  wife  and  children,  so  selfish  is  it. 
I  won't  detain  you  for  a  long  time  now,  but 
just  touch  off  a  few  matters  about  drunkenness. 
The  cost  is  great  of  intemperance,  and  150 
millions  of  dollars  are  spent  in  the  United 
States  annually  on  liquor.  Seven  out  of  ten  of 
the  convicts  are  from  drink. 

"We  should  get  posted  up  (informed)  on 
this  subject,  to  be  able  to  speak  on  it.  We  are 
all  in  pursuit  of  happiness,  but  I  think  it  can  be 
attained  by  different  means,  the  most  absurd  is 

H  2 


100  PASSAGES    IN 

the  indulgence  of  our  appetites.  The  cost  of 
the  police,  and  of  jails  is  from  liquor,  if  we  will 
put  down  drink,  we  will  put  down  all  that. 
If  you  allow  publicans,  they  will  entail  great 
cost,  rum-sellers  make  criminals  and  paupers, 
and  fill  jails,  and  you  pay  the  expense.  I  have 
never  seen  a  drunken  man  succeed  in  business, 
if  he  did,  I,  being  fond  of  curiosities,  would 
exhibit  him  in  the  New  York  Museum. 

"  A  man  who  drinks  is  muddled,  has  lassitude, 
and  is  unfit  for  work.  The  Maine  Law  would 
remove  all  temptation  to  drink,  and  some 
drunkards  would  be  very  glad  of  this.  Publi- 
cans then  would  not  be  able  to  live  by  drink ; 
but  some  people  say,  '  oh  you  carry  this  too 
far,  it  is  tyrannical,'  no,  you  may  keep  as  much 
liquor  as  you  like  in  your  cellar,  if  foolish 
enough  to  do  so,  and  drink  as  much  as  you 
please  yourself,  only  you  must  not  sell  it  to 
another,  that  is  all  the  Maine  Law  says.  Then 
again  you  say,  '  the  doctors  recommend  liquor,' 
no,  the  doctors  recommend  drugs  to  those  who 
are  ill ;  again  you  say,  '  God  made  alcohol  and 
we  should  use  it,'  no,  there  is  not  a  particle  of 
it  in  nature,  no  spirit  in  the  mineral  and  vege-

table  kingdom,  the  proof  is  you  may  eat  barley 
and  grapes  in  any  quantity,  and  you  won't  be 
intoxicated. 

"  I  saw  wine  made  in  France,  not  in  presses, 
but  the  grapes  were  trodden  with  the  feet,  the 
juice  was  innocent,  and  whilst  eating  bread  with 
it,  the  labourer  played  the  fiddle  ;  but  the  juice 
allowed  to  ferment,  they  were  injured  by  it,  and 
rolled  about  instead  of  dancing,  the  substance  of 
the  juice  was  changed.  Sir  Astley  Cooper  never 
admitted  alcohol  into  his  house,  it  was  poison 
he  thought,  alcohol  never  digests,  tap  the  arm 
of  a  drunkard  and  you  get  pure  alcohol.  My 
mother  was  recommended  to  take  milk-punch 
when  I  was  a  nursing  child,  to  keep  me  quiet 
when  I  was  troublesome,  she  did  so  and  1  went 
off  to  sleep. 

"  Alcohol  is  a  nervine,  that  is,  it  destroys  the

a  narcotic.  Green  tea,  which  ladies  are  fond  of, 
is  something  like  this,  and  it  kills  one  if  you 
drink  it  all  day.  Ladies,  with  green  tea,  go  on  a 
spree,  but  they  don't  give  it  that  name,  they 
call  it  a  tea  party !  they  drink  three  or  four 
cups,  then  hear  how  they  talk,  all  in  good 
nature,  intend  no  harm,  but  how  they  cut  up

their  neighbours  ! — I'll  tell  you  the  effects  of 
liquor.  I  once  saw  on  board  a  Mississippi 
steamer,  a  man  who  had  been  drinking  brandy, 
he  ran  out  of  his  state  room,  rushed  through  the 
ladies'  cabin  and  the  gentlemen's  cabin  into  the 
social  hall,  (where  some  folks  get  socially  drunk 
at  a  bar),  people  ran  after  him,  I  did  so  too,  he 
wanted  to  break  the  chairs,  to  strike,  to  kill ;  he 
saw  a  poor  creature  sitting  in  a  narcotic  state 
in  a  corner,  he  looked  at  him  and  cried, 

"  '  I'll  eat  him  —  I'll  eat  him  !'  the  other 
opened  his  eyes  and  said  yawning, 

"  '  I — never — said — so — ' 

" '  I'll  eat  him  !*  cried  the  man,  mad  with 
drink. 

"'I — never — said — so — *  slowly  repeated 
the  other.  This  shewed  the  difference  between 
alcohol  as  a  stimulant  and  a  narcotic." 

Mr.  Barnum  now  said  c  a  collection  would  be 
taken  up,'  before  he  touched  on  the  Maine 
Liquor  Law,  after  which  he  continued : — 

"  A  rum-seller  only  benefits  himself,  a  shoe- 
maker benefits  others,  a  robber  with  a  pistol  in 
his  hand  says,  '  your  money  or  your  life !'  a 
rum-seller  with  a  bottle  in  one  hand  and  glass 
in  the  other,  says,  '  your  money  and  your  life  I" 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  103 

I'll  undertake  to  carry  the  Maine  Liquor  Law 
through  in  Connecticut,  and  will  do  it  next 
year.  '  Oh  !'  say  some  folks,  '  why  not  try  moral 
suasion,  you  hurt  yourself  by  trying  law.'  But 
moral  suasion  will  not  do  for  the  rum-seller,  and 
he  will  evade  the  law  by  painting  a  pig  blue  and 
yellow,  and  then  exhibits  '  the  striped  pig,'  be- 
hind a  screen,  gets  ten  cents  for  this  and  gives 
in  a  glass  of  liquor  and  a  cracker.  He  gets 
round  the  fifteen  gallon  law  too  ;  gets  two  or 
three  to  join,  and  get  fifteen  gallons  of  liquor 
and  they  divide  it,  and  also  they  get  up  indig- 
nation meetings  about  the  Maine  Liquor  Law. 

"  Moral  suasion  is  like  a  big  lubberly  boy,  who 
was  crying,  at  the  top  of  his  voice,  in  the  street, 
and  he  was  asked  '  what  is  the  matter  with 
ye ?'  'I  want  to  be  pacified,'  said  he,  '  I  want 
mother  to  come  and  pacify  me,'  so  it  is  with 
moral  suasion,  to  pacify  people,  but  it  can't  do 
it.  The  Maine  Law  says,  '  you  must  not  sell 
liquor  though  you  may  have  it  in  your  cellar,' 
and  some  tried  to  frighten  folks  with  Maine 
Law,  but  it  won't  do.  It  was  like  an  old  woman 
who  was  coming  from  church,  and  she  met 
a  man  dressed  up  with  horns  sticking  out  of 
bis  head  and  a  tail,  and  he  cried  *  Bo !'  the  old 


104  PASSAGES   IN 

woman  was  credulous  but  also  religious,  and 
she  said : — 

"'Who  are  you?' 

"  And  he  answered, 

"  '  I  am  the  devil !' 

"  c  You're  a  poor  crittur,'  said  she. 

"  By  the  Maine  Law,  if  a  man  is  convicted  of 
selling  liquor,  he  is  fined  1 0  dollars  for  the  first 
offence,  for  the  second  20  dollars,  and  for  the 
third  he  is  imprisoned  for  three  months,  but 
this  may  fail  to  stop  him,  and  he  may  pay  and 
go  on.  But  wait  till  there  are  10  or  12  in- 
dictments against  him,  and  he  is  to  be 
imprisoned  for  36  months,  he  will  then  be  beat, 
and  will  sign  a  paper  to  give  up  rum-selling. 

"  After  the  Maine  Law  came  into  operation  in 
Portland,  the  House  of  Correction  was  empty, 
they  used  to  lock  up  men  there,  they  now  lock 
up  liquor  seized  ;  formerly  a  man  was  seen  like 
a  walking  demijohn  of  liquor,  and  they  locked 
him  up ;  now  the  liquor  only  is  locked  up. 
'  Ah,  but  this  interferes  with  property,'  say  some, 
but  if  a  tiger  got  out  of  my  menagerie  and 
killed  a  man,  would  it  not  be  justifiable  to  take 
a  rifle  and  shoot  it,  or  to  shoot  a  mad  dog  ? 
So  liquor,  which  rages  like  a  tiger,  and  drives

people  mad  must  be  put  down,  and  you  will  all 
sing  Hosannahs  if  it  is  so  here." 

For  some  years  past,  since  I  have  had  sol- 
diers under  my  charge,  I  have  taken  a  consider- 
able interest  about  Temperance,  my  ideas  on 
the  subject  are  to  be  found  elsewhere,*  Mr. 
Barnum's  peculiar  lecture  will  suffice  in  the 
meantime.  Mr.  Gough,  the  celebrated  lecturer, 
came  twice  to  Montreal,  and  I  asked  him  if  he 
would  lecture  to  the  garrison,  he  said, 

"  I  think  I  can  speak  to  soldiers  with  some 
effect,  as  I  am  the  son  of  a  pensioner  of  your 
52nd  Regiment." 

The  men  heard  him  with  great  attention,  he 
made  them  laugh  one  minute,  and  they  were 
sobbing  and  crying  the  next.  Of  their  own 
accord  they  went  and  asked  him  to  lecture 
again,  he  did  so,  many  took  the  pledge  and  kept 
it,  and  when  he  left  they  accompanied  him  to 
the  wharf,  and  cheered  him  heartily  as  he  went 
off  in  a  steamer. 

After  a  tedious  Canadian  winter  of  six 
months,  the  weather,  as  is  usual,  became 
"  blazing  hot,"  when  there  is  always  great 
danger  of  fire  in  the  American  cities  of  stone&gt;

brick  and  wood  intermixed,  many  of  whose 
roofs  are  of  wooden  shingles,  and  whose  out- 
houses and  stables  are  almost  all  of  highly 
inflammable  materials.  In  short,  there  is,  as  it 
were,  a  train  of  gunpowder  laid  along  the  back 
of  the  streets,  so  much  for  the  wisdom  of  our 
ancestors  and  the  old  municipal  authorities. 

Half  a  dozen  years  before  this,  Quebec  suf- 
fered fearfully,  and  20,000  of  her  people  were 
burnt  out  by  two  great  fires  in  one  summer. 
In  1852,  Montreal  was  devastated  and  12,000 
of  her  citizens  were  roofless.  At  a  great  fire 
at  which  I  assisted,  which  took  place  on  the  6th 
June,  in  the  principal  commercial  street,  St. 
Pauls,  and  along  the  quays,  fifty  or  sixty  houses 
were  burnt,  and  £250,000  worth  of  property 
destroyed.  This  was  bad  enough,  but  at  the 
second  great  fire  on  the  8th  July,  the  St.  Law- 
rence and  St.  Mary's  suburbs  were  consumed  and 
1100  houses  and  £500,000  worth  of  property 
destroyed.  This  was  something  like  a  great 
fire,  and  the  chastening  hand  of  the  Almighty 
was  heavy  indeed  on  the  people  that  year. 

At  the  first  fire  in  June,  General  Rowan,  the 
staff  and  the  garrison  were  actively  engaged  in 
endeavouring  to  save  life  and  property,  two 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  107 

lives  were  lost,  and  considerable  risk  was  run 
of  being  blown  up  by  gunpowder,  as  some  of  the 
hard-ware  stores  in  St.  Paul's  Street,  contained 
several  kegs  of  powder,  though  contrary  to  law. 
The  ships  were  saved  with  difficulty.  At  the 
last  and  most  terrible  conflagration,  the  exer- 
tions of  the  military  were  beyond  all  praise,  the 
men  of  the  20th  Regiment,  and  of  the  Royal 
Artillery,  working,  directed  by  their  officers,  till 
they  dropped  from  fatigue,  and  under  the  influ- 
ence of  a  sun  whose  heat  was  90°  in  the  shade, 
and  of  flames  which  raged  50  feet  above  the 
highest  houses. 

The  fire  of  the  8th  July,  began  at  a  baker's 
shop  in  the  middle  of  St.  Lawrence  Street,  at  9 
A.M.  For  nearly  an  hour  little  or  no  water  could 
be  got,  the  reservoir,  at  the  upper  part  of  the  city, 
was  unfortunately  empty,  as  new  arrangements 
were  being  made ;  about  water  pipes  the  fire  got 
headway  with  a  westerly  breeze,  spread  right 
and  left,  and  swept  everything  before  it.  The 
engines  were  of  no  use,  the  wooden  roofs  were 
like  tinder,  and  the  tin  roofs  of  stone  buildings 
quickly  caught  from  their  wooden  gutters. 

The  people,  in  advance  of  the  fire,  hur- 
riedly making  up  their  clothes  in  bundles,  fled, 


108  PASSAGES    IN 

leaving  most  of  their  furniture  to  be  de- 
stroyed. The  whole  city  of  60,000  inhabitants 
was  in  fearful  commotion,  agitated  crowds  ran 
to  and  fro  distracted,  and  vehicles  of  every 
description  carried  off  females,  the  old,  and 
infirm,  and  children  to  places  of  safety.  Many 
valuables  were  also  carried  off,  and  were  never 
seen  again  by  the  owners.  Plate-chests,  cash- 
boxes,  jewellery  disappeared. 

The  fire  now  raged  like  a  hurricane,  and 
smoke  and  burning  flakes,  and  a  whirlwind  of 
sand  preceded  the  flames,  which  crossed  the 
streets  (running  at  right  angles  between 
the  St.  Lawrence  and  the  mountain)  in  vast 
sheets  of  apparently  several  hundred  yards 
wide,  the  scene  was  terrifically  grand  and 
imposing,  and  most  melancholy.  At  5  P.M. 
at  the  open  space  of  the  Viger  Square,  for  want 
of  material,  the  fire  seemed  to  cease,  and  the 
exhausted  crowds  retired  to  breathe  and  rest; 
but  at  8  P.M.  a  light  flame  suddenly  shot  up 
behind  the  largest  hotel,  Hayes'  House,  it  was 
quickly  consumed,  and  the  limestone  walls  fell 
inwards  with  an  awful  crash,  the  flames  then 
"licked  up"  the  fine  three  storey  houses  in 
Dalhousie  Square,  catching  from  the  wooden 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  109 

stables  in  the  rear,  and  then  swept  down  St. 
Mary's  Street  to  the  jail,  raging  all  night.  The 
length  of  the  fire  was  reckoned  at  a  mile  by 
half  a  mile  broad,  and  this  great  space  presented 
the  appearance  of  a  red  and  grey  surface,  with 
crumbling  and  blackened  walls,  and  tall  chim- 
neys standing  in  all  directions  like  gigantic 
tombstones. 

The  Roman  Catholics  made  great  exertions 
to  save  their  Bishop's  Church  and  palace,  holy 
water  was  sprinkled  in  vain  to  arrest  the  flames, 
the  priests  and  nuns  carried  off  the  pictures  and 
images,  but  the  buildings  were  destroyed,  also 
St.  Thomas'  Church  and  some  Chaples. 

The  Infantry  and  Artillery  Barracks  were 
saved  by  the  greatest  exertions  on  the  part  of  the 
soldiers,  and  by  Captain  Gallwey  R.E.  blowing  up 
a  house  near  them  to  make  an  open  space,  almost 
all  the  military  stores  were  preserved,  but  most 
of  the  officers  were  burnt  out  of  their  hired 
quarters,  suffered  great  loss  of  clothes  and 
effects  and  were  afterwards  uncomfortably 
lodged  in  various  directions.  A  great  many  of 
the  people  fled  to  the  country,  some  of  the  rest 
erected  temporary  wooden  sheds  among  the 
ruins,  waiting  for  help  to  rebuild — and  tents

supplied  from  the  military  stores  were  pitched  in 
all  directions  for  the  people. 

A  fourth  part  of  the  fair  city  was  '  in  heaps/ 
About  a  dozen  people  died  from  the  stroke  of 
the  sun  on  the  day  of  the  fire ;  and  numbers 
took  to  their  beds.  The  smell  of  dead  animals 
among  the  ruins,  was  most  unpleasant. 

I  had  gone  off  two  days  before  the  fire  with 
two  of  my  family,  to  visit  some  relations  near 
Gait,  Canada  West ;  we  had  got  as  far  as 
Hamilton,  when  a  telegraph  message  came  to 
Sir  Allan  McNab  there,  to  inform  me  that  "  my 
house  was  burnt,  and  the  children  removed." 
This  was  so  vague,  that  we  could  not  go  on,  but 
hurried  back,  thinking,  as  we  rolled  down  the 
long  Sault  Rapids,  and  pitched  and  twisted 
among  the  rocks  of  the  Lachine,  that  the  voyage 
was  far  too  tedious,  till  we  reached  Montreal  and 
saw  it  still  partly  in  flames,  the  third  day  after 
the  commencement  of  the  conflagration. 

I  found  our  late  pleasant  house  in  Cornwall 
Terrace,  entirely  burnt  out,  black,  gaunt  and 
roofless.  All  my  swords  (5),  belts,  best  books, 
guns  and  rifle,  gymnastic  apparatus,  and  trophies 
of  the  chase  in  Africa,  irretrievably  gone  ;  those 
of  my  effects  which  were  not  destroyed  or  stolen,

were  scattered,  the  horses,  carriage  and  sleigh 
saved ;  and  Brigade  Major  Mitchell,  R.A.,  had 
kindly  carried  off,  to  his  own  house,  our  two 
little  boys,  and  two  of  the  maid-servants,  whilst 
burning  flakes  fell  upon  them ;  he  also  gave  us 
shelter  until  we  were  ready  to  move  to  a  cottage 
behind  the  mountain,  at  St.  Catherine's.  Thank- 
ful that  no  lives  were  lost,  we  tried  to  make  the 
best  of  our  position,  others  having  suffered  as 
much  as  we  had. 

To  refresh  a  little  after  the  great  fire,  we  went, 
sometime  afterwards,  to  visit  the  very  interesting 
falls  of  Shewenegan  on  the  St.  Maurice  river. 
Miss  Lunn,  Lord  Mark  Kerr,  20th  Regiment, 
Captain  Francis,  the  Hon.  F.  C.  Colborne,  A.D.C., 
and  Captain  Maycock,  20th,  being  of  the  party. 
We  slept  very  comfortably  at  an  hotel,  at  Three 
Rivers ;  then  up  by  times  next  morning,  and  off 
in  waggons  and  caleshes  over  a  road  roughened 
with  the  wheels  of  charcoal  carts,  then  got  into 
a  large  canoe,  and  paddled  '  up  stream '  to  the 
bottom  of  the  Falls,  where  the  river  rushed  round 
a  large  wooded  island,  and  dashed  with  great 
noise,  and  amidst  clouds  of  spray  over,  black 
rocks  of  fantastic  shape  into  a  vast  caldron  of 
unknown  depth.  Years  ago,  an  incident  of  a 


112  PASSAGES    IN 

tragic  nature  took  place  at  these  Falls.  Part  of  a 
tribe  of  Indians  was  descending  the  St.  Maurice, 
in  several  canoes,  intending  to  stop  above  the 
Falls  and  make  a  portage  round  them.  As  they 
drew  near,  the  chief,  in  the  leading  canoe,  ob- 
served the  banks  lined  with  the  warriors  of  a 
hostile  tribe  waiting  in  ambush  to  surprise  and 
overpower  them.  Standing  up  in  his  canoe,  he 
pointed  with  his  paddle  to  the  bush,  and  then 
down  the  stream  to  the  cataract,  his  people  un- 
derstood his  meaning,  '  better  to  perish  in  the 
thunder  of  waters  than  by  the  scalping  knife  and 
tomahawk  of  their  foes/  and  the  whole,  without 
hesitation,  glided  down  the  rapids,  and  perished 
amidst  the  thundering  waters  of  the  Great  Shew- 
enegan.

Point,  prepared  them  to  render  unformed  sol- 
diers intelligent,  and  to  organise  them  for 
useful  service  in  the  field.  A  large  body  of 
officers,  of  high  attainments,  and  capable  of 
serving  with  distinction  in  any  part  of  the 
world,  have  proceeded  from  the  Military  School 
on  the  banks  of  the  far-famed  Hudson. 

Having  seen  previously  the  outside  of  the 
Military  Academy,  I  now  determined  to  observe 
its  interior  arrangements  also,  and  to  ascertain 
the  system  of  military  instruction  among  a 
practical  people.  Accordingly,  I  communicated 
my  intention  to  some  brother  officers  on  the 
staff,  Lieut.-Colonel  D'Urban,  deputy  quarter- 
master-general in  Canada,  Major  H.  Rowan, 
R.A.,  military  secretary,  and  Captain  Wetherall, 
A.D.C.  They  agreed  to  visit  West  Point  first, 
and  afterwards  proceed  to  see  something  of  life 
in  the  gay  commercial  capital  of  the  States, 
New  York.  I  wrote  to  the  Superintendent  of 
the  U.  S.  Military  Academy,  Colonel  Lee,  inti- 
mating our  proposed  visit,  and  received  in 
return  a  friendly  invitation  to  West  Point.  He 
suggested  that  the  best  time  to  see  the  Aca- 
demy was  at  the  annual  examination,  in  June, 
but  I  preferred  seeing  the  working  of  the 
system  during  the  course  of  study. 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER. 

It  was  in  April,  1853,  when  we  left  Montreal. 
The  river,  opposite  the  city,  was  dangerous  to 
cross,  being  full  of  ice,  which  was  getting  soft 
under  the  influence  of  the  spring  sun,  and  the 
stream  was  cutting  in  it  long  channels.  We 
entered  the  caravan-like  passenger  car  at  the 
terminus  of  the  Lachine  railroad,  and  sped 
onwards  to  the  head  of  the  foaming  and  wildly- 
tossed  rapids  below  the  Indian  village  of  Caugh- 
nawaga. 

We  encountered  a  scene  of  painful  excite- 
ment at  the  commencement  of  our  journey :  a 
woman  of  about  thirty  years  of  age,  respectably 
dressed,  sat  beside  a  man  with  black  hair  and 
beard  ;  she  said  loudly,  "  Give  me  my  gold 
watch  and  chain;  I  cannot  trust  you  to  keep 
them  !"  "  I'll  give  you  them  by-and-bye,"  he 
answered ;  when  she  burst  out — 

"I  am  alone  star 
And  my  love  has  gone  to  the  war ; 
His  name  is  Bryan  Buroo, 
No  other  Bryan  would  do." 

We  thought  she  was  intoxicated ;  but  the 
poor  creature  was  raving  mad,  and  was  on  her 
way  to  an  asylum  in  the  States.

Her  paroxysms  became  stronger,  she  sang 
other  scraps  of  songs,  threw  herself  on  the  floor 
of  the  car,  and  tried  to  break  the  windows ; 
plucked  her  husband's  beard,  and  called  him 
King  John.  He  had  great  difficulty  in  holding 
her,  whilst  she  tried  to  tear  off  her  clothes. 
Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson,  the  mayor  of  Montreal 
(by  a  singular  turn  of  fortune,  as  he  was  distin- 
guished for  his  courage  and  activity,  in  the 
wrong  cause,  in  the  "troubles"  of  1837  and 
'38)  was  present,  and  he  suggested  tying  her 
arms  with  cords,  which  was  done.  She 
became  quieter,  and  even  sensible,  and  said, 
"  Oh,  my  poor  man !  I  know  I  give  you  a  great 
deal  of  trouble — I  can't  help  it ;  but  I'll  be  all 
right  when  I  go  to  New  York  again  ;  they  will 
take  good  care  of  me  there,  and  do  you  look 
after  my  children."  The  husband  told  the 
Doctor  that  he  had  not  slept  for  three  nights 
watching  his  wife,  who  some  time  before  had 
gone  mad,  after  confinement.  He  had  taken 
her  to  New  York,  where,  in  two  months,  she 
seemed  to  be  cured ;  but  the  madness  had 
come  on  again  through  fright,  in  crossing  the 
ice  of  the  St.  Lawrence  on  the  way  home.

treatment,  and  occupying  an  opposite  seat,  did 
not  increase  our  comfort;  but,  crossing  the 
ferry,  we  got  into  new  cars  and  company,  and 
rolled  on  towards  Moore's  station,  with  Mr. 
Coffin  in  company,  the  energetic  and  intelligent 
president  of  the  railroad.  The  floors  of  the 
cars  were  covered  with  a  comfortable-looking 
matting;  but  when  a  reverend  gentleman 
looked  at  this,  he  gravely  remarked,  "This 
seemed  a  good  arrangement  at  first,  till  I  re- 
membered the  peculiar  habits  of  the  country  ;" 
he  alluded  to  the  too  free  use  of  tobacco.  We 
believe  "  chewing  "  is  wearing  out.  Tobacco  is 
of  use  in  keeping  wild  and  excitable  people 
tolerably  quiet;  its  abuse  is  when  men  of  in- 
telligence and  education  indulge  in  more  than 
a  mild  cigar  "  of  an  afternoon." 

A  lady  of  a  fine  spirit  had  been  placed  under 
my  charge,  to  see  her  safe  as  far  as  I  could. 
She  was  the  widow  of  a  distinguished  lawyer, 
but  she  hardly  required  assistance ;  for,  in 
America,  the  ladies  can  take  good  care  of 
themselves.  Thus  she  said,  "  People  talk  of 
danger  on  the  rail ;  I  never  think  of  it,  I've  too 
many  other  things  to  think  of ;  there's  danger 
ia  one's  own  house,  there's  danger  everywhere."

I  was  anxious  about  her  baggage ;  but  she 
said  it  was  all  ticketed,  and  the  railroad  people 
were  responsible.  However,  it  was  very  easy  to 
lose  one's  portmanteau  on  American  lines,  as 
happened  to  two  or  three  of  our  fellow-passen- 
gers, on  the  change  of  cars  and  lines. 

From  Moore's  we  went  to  Rouse's  Point,  and 
from  thence  to  Rutland.  I  observed,  with  Mr. 
Samuel  Keefer,  a  civil  engineer  of  note,  the 
wood  and  iron  bridges,  which  require  screwing 
up  every  few  months ;  all  the  sleepers  were 
hemlock,  cross  laid ;  there  were  no  longitudinal 
ones ;  there  was  a  want  of  attention  to  drain- 
age ;  the  ditches  were  full  of  water,  which  was 
soaking  through  the  ballast,  and  destroying  the 
wood  by  capillary  attraction;  men  were  em- 
ployed here  and  there  raising  the  sunken 
sleepers,  and  introducing  gravel  below  them ; 
the  fences  were  not  good,  they  were  slight, 
costing  about  half  a  dollar  the  rod  ;  but,  in 
time,  all  these  defects  will  be  remedied  on  the 
paying  lines. 

We  passed  the  scene  of  the  battle  of  Ben- 
nington  ;  and  in  the  valley  of  the  Otter  river, 
saw  a  farm  of  1 60  acres,  producing  beautiful 
white  marble ;  the  land  was  sold  lately  for  one 


THE    LIFE    OF   A  SOLDIER.  119 

hundred  thousand  dollars.  It  was  at  Benning- 
ton  that  the  tide  of  General  Burgoyne's  good 
fortune  turned,  in  the  war  of  the  Revolution. 
He  had  despatched  Colonel  Baume  with  500 
German  troops,  to  secure  the  stores  collected  at 
Bennington,  and  guarded  by  American  militia 
under  General  Starke ;  but  these  being  found 
to  be  stronger  than  was  supposed,  Baume  has- 
tened to  entrench  himself,  and  sent  for  rein- 
forcements, but  was  attacked  and  defeated 
before  they  arrived  under  Colonel  Breymar, 
who  also  was  repulsed  by  the  militia,  and  the 
continental  reinforcements  under  Colonel 
Warner. 

The  dust  is  a  serious  inconvenience  on  the 
American  lines  in  summer.  I  do  not  see  why 
they  should  not  be  sown  with  grass,  or  sodded, 
to  prevent  this.  Some  of  the  cars  were  provided 
with  a  pan  of  water,  under  the  ventilator  at  the 
top,  to  catch  the  dust;  whilst  the  windows 
opening  down  the  middle,  had  a  current  of  air 
rushing  out,  which  prevented  the  tendency  of 
dust  to  fly  in. 

We  arrived  at  Coldspring,  on  the  Hudson, 
where  we  left  the  cars ;  and,  in  the  midst  of 
much  rain  and  wind,  we  consigned  ourselves

and  "mails"  to  two  skiffs,  and  were  ferried 
down  and  across  the  noble  river  to  the  rocky 
plateau,  on  which  conspicuous  stands  the  build- 
ings of  the  Military  Academy  of  West  Point. 
We  found  rooms  at  the  comfortable  hotel  of 
Mr.  Roe,  where  boarded  some  of  the  married 
officers  of  the  Academy. 

The  situation;  of  the  Academy  is  admirable, 
away  from  the  distraction  and  contamination  of 
towns,  high  above 

"  The  great,  glorious  river,  broad  and  deep," 

enjoying  the  purest  air,  beautiful  wooded  and 
craggy  hills  around,  remains  of  forts  and  fast- 
nesses (celebrated  in  the  seven  years'  revolu- 
tionary war)  within  sight ;  all  which  combine  to 
show  the  wisdom  which  dictated  the  selection  of 
Wrest  Point  as  a  very  fit  position  for  prosecuting, 
with  advantage,  studies,  which  are  intended  to 
conduce  to  the  honour  and  the  strength  of 
Britain's  healthy  offspring,  the  United  States  of 
America. 

We  sent  our  cards  to  the  Superintendent, 
Colonel  Lee,  and  requested  to  know  when  we 
might  call  on  him;  he  returned  a  polite 
message  by  Bt.  Major  Porter,  his  adjutant,  and 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  121 

breveted  for  Mexico,  who  conducted  us  to  the 
Superintendent's  office. 

Colonel  Robert  Edmund  Lee  is  an  active- 
looking  and  intelligent  officer  of  middle  age, 
with  a  very  gentlemanlike  address.  He  is  a 
Virginian,  a  cadet  of  1825,  and  belongs  to  the 
United  States  engineers;  was  assistant  astro- 
nomer for  fixing  the  boundary  between  Ohio 
and  Michigan  in  1835  ;  was  chief  engineer  of 
the  army  of  General  Wool  in  the  Mexican 
war  of  1846  ;  was  made  Bt.  Major  for  gallant 
and  meritorious  conduct  in  the  battle  of  Cerro 
Gordo  in  1847  ;  Bt.  Lt.  Colonel  for  distin- 
guished service  in  the  battles  of  Contreras  and 
Cherubusco  the  same  year ;  and  lastly,  Bt. 
Colonel  for  his  gallantry  in  the  battle  of  Che- 
pultepec,  where  he  was  wounded ;  he  then 
deservedly  became  Superintendent  of  the  Mili- 
tary Academy  in  1852.  By  marriage  he  is 
nearly  connected  with  the  family  of  the  great 
Washington. 

Captain  George  W.  Cullum,  of  the  United 
States  engineers — a  very  valuable  officer,  pro- 
fessor of  practical  military  engineering  at  West 
Point,  and  whose  other  onerous  duties  were,  the 
charge  of  the  fortifications  at  New  London,  and

of  the  assay  office  or  mint  at  New  York,  and 
who  was  a  brother  juror  with  me  on  arms, 
accoutrements,  engineering,  &amp;c.,  at  the  Crystal 
Palace,  New  York — on  my  applying  to  him, 
was  so  obliging  as  to  give  me  particulars  of  the 
public  buildings  of  the  Military  Academy,  which 
are  these : 

The  Cadets'  Barracks ;  Cadets'  Guard-house ; 
the  Academy  ;  Mess  Hall ;  Hospital ;  Chapel ; 
Observatory  and  Library ;  Laboratory ;  Super- 
intendent's, Professors',  and  Officers'  Quarters  ; 
Hotel ;  Engineer,  Dragoon,  Artillery,  and  Band 
Barracks ;  Dragoon  and  Artillery  Stables ; 
Commissary's,  Sutler's,  Shoemaker's,  and 
Tailor's  Shops;  Engineer  Equipment  Shed; 
Powder  Magazine;  Soldiers'  Guard  Houses; 
&amp;c. 

Cadets'  Barracks. — This  is  a  *arge  four- 
storey  building,  in  the  castellated  Gothic  style 
of  architecture,  360  feet  long  by  60  broad, 
with  an  L  or  wing,  100  feet  long  by  60  broad. 
It  contains  176  rooms,  136  of  which  are  occu- 
pied by  cadets,  and  40  at  present  by  bachelor 
officers  of  the  post.  The  cadet  rooms  are  22 
by  14  feet,  at  one  extremity  of  which  are  two 
sleeping  alcoves  for  the  two  occupants,  each  7 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  123 

feet  square.  The  furniture  of  each  room  con- 
sists of  two  iron  study  tables,  a  clothes-press, 
wash-stand,  gun-rack,  &amp;c.,  and  two  iron  bed 
steads,  hair  mattresses,  and  necessary  blankets, 
&amp;c. 

Cadets'  Guard  House. — In  rear  of  the 
cadets'  barracks  is  the  guard-house,  a  small 
two-storey  brick  building,  in  which  are  the 
offices  of  the  commandant  of  cadets,  the  officer 
in  charge,  the  cadet  adjutant,  and  rooms  for  the 
fire-engines. 

Academy. — The  academic  building  is  a  very 
spacious  structure,  275  feet  long,  75  feet  broad, 
and  three  stories  high,  built  of  granite,  with 
red-sandstone  dressings,  columns,  &amp;c.,  in  the 
Italian  style  of  architecture.  In  the  first  storey 
is  the  Chemical  Laboratory,  75  by  38  feet; 
the  Fencing  Hall,  75  by  38  feet ;  and  a  large 
room,  188  by  65  feet,  at  present  used,  for  want 
of  a  better,  as  a  Riding  Hall.  In  the  second 
storey  are  the  Mineralogical  and  Geological 
Cabinets,  75  by  38  feet ;  and  Engineering 
Academy,  75  by  38  feet — to  which  are  attached 
two  rooms,  each  46  by  22  feet,  for  models  of 
machinery,  architecture,  and  civil  and  military 
engineering.  In  the  third  storey  is  the  Trophy 


124  PASSAGES   IN 

Room,  75  by  38  feet,  in  which,  besides  cap- 
tured flags  and  other  military  trophies,  is  a  fine 
model  of  the  silver  mine  of  Valenciana  in  Gua- 
naxuato,  brought  from  Mexico,  and  a  small 
collection  of  artillery  models,  &amp;c. ;  also,  on  the 
same  floor,  is  the  Drawing  Academy,  75  by  38 
feet — to  which  are  attached  the  Statuary  and 
Picture  Galleries,  each  70  by  22  feet,  the 
former  being  chiefly  filled  with  plaster  casts  for 
drawing  models,  and  the  latter  containing  the 
exhibition  of  paintings,  drawings,  &amp;c.,  executed 
by  cadets,  besides  a  full-length  portrait,  by  Pro- 
fessor Robert  W.  Weir,  of  Colonel  Sylvanus 
Thayer,  of  the  corps  of  engineers,  one  of  the 
most  distinguished  of  the  superintendents,  and 
called  the  "  father  of  the  Academy."  The  re- 
mainder of  the  academic  building  is  occupied  by 
twenty-two  rooms,  each  about  24  by  22  feet, 
which  are  used  for  Recitation  and  Lecture 
Rooms  for  the  various  departments  of  in- 
struction. 

Mess  Hall. — A  beautiful  granite  building, 
170  by  64  feet,  in  the  Norman  style  of 
architecture,  the  central  part  consisting,  above 
the  basement,  of  a  spacious  room,  100  feet  long, 
50  broad,  and  20  high,  in  which  all  the  cadets 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  125 

are  messed  together.  In  the  northern  wing, 
the  purveyor  of  cadets'  commons  is  quartered ; 
and  the  southern  wing  and  towers  contain  the 
Mess  Rooms,  &amp;c.,  of  the  officers  of  the  army  on 
duty  at  the  Academy.  The  Kitchen,  Store 
Rooms,  &amp;c.,  pertaining  to  the  cadets'  mess 
hall,  adjoin  it  in  rear. 

Hospital. — A  plain  granite  building,  1 30  by 
40  feet,  the  central  part  being  occupied  by 
the  wards  for  sick  cadets,  and  the  wings  being 
the  residences  of  the  surgeon  and  assistant- 
surgeon  of  the  post. 

Chapel. — A  granite  building,  100  by  53 
feet,  in  the  Roman  style,  with  open  slips  for  the 
cadets  (all  of  whom  are  required  to  attend 
Divine  service  on  Sunday),  and  closed  pews  for 
professors,  officers,  and  visitors.  On  the  wall 
above  and  behind  the  chancel  is  a  beautiful 
painting,  by  Professor  Weir,  representing  the 
United  States  on  a  field  azure,  with  thirteen 
stars  resting  upon  a  tablet,  on  which  is  inscribed, 
"Righteousness  exalteth  a  nation,  but  sin  is  a 
reproach  upon  any  people,"  and  supported  by 
allegorical  figures  of  peace  and  war. 

Observatory  and  Library. — This  is  a  hand- 
some granite  building,  about  160  by  80  feet, 


126  PASSAGES    IN 

in  the  Elizabethan  style  of  architecture.  The 
Library  Room,  occupying  the  east  wing  of  the 
building,  is  46  feet  square  and  31  high,  with  a 
gallery,  and  two  tiers  of  book- cases,  containing 
16,000  volumes,  chiefly  military,  scientific,  and 
historical  works,  300  choice  maps  and  charts, 
70  volumes  of  valuable  engravings,  and  ten 
paintings,  Presidents  Jefferson  and  Munroe, 
under  whose  administration  the  Military  Aca- 
demy was  established  and  extended  ;  Mr.  Cal- 
houn,  the  secretary  of  war,  who  was  very 
instrumental  in  improving  the  institution; 
Colonel  Williams,  the  first  chief  engineer  and 
superintendent  of  the  Academy;  Professor 
Mansfield,  the  earliest  professor  of  mathematics, 
and,  subsequently,  from  1812  to  1828,  of 
natural  experimental  philosophy;  the  other 
portraits  are  those  of  General  Swift,  Colonel 
Armstead,  General  Macomb,  General  Gratiot, 
and  General  Totten,  all  of  whom  have  been 
chiefs  of  engineers  and  (ex-officio)  inspectors  of 
the  academy.  There  are  also  in  the  library 
well-executed  marble  busts  of  Washington, 
Lafayette,  and  Napoleon,  the  generous  gift  of 
Mr.  Thorn,  of  New  York ;  a  few  medals,  one 
of  which  is  that  voted  by  the  State  of  New

York  to  her  gallant  son,  the  late  Colonel  Bliss, 
the  distinguished  chief  of  the  staff  of  General 
Taylor  in  the  Mexican  war ;  and  sections  of  the 
various  flag-staffs  from  the  fields  of  battle, 
fortified  places,  &amp;c.,  won  in  the  Mexican  war  by 
the  United  States  army,  officered  mainly  by  the 
eleves  of  the  Military  Academy.  The  library  is 
a  very  elegant  and  tastefully  arranged  room. 
In  the  same  building  with  the  library  are  the 
offices  of  the  superintendent  and  his  military 
staff ;  Philosophical  Lecture  Room,  containing 
a  good  collection  of  apparatus  for  the  illustration 
of  the  principles  of  mechanics,  acoustics,  optics, 
electro-dynamics,  astronomy,  &amp;c. ;  and  in  the 
three  towers,  or  observatories,  are  a  large 
transit  instrument,  equatorial  telescope,  and 
mural  circle. 

Laboratory. — This  consists  of  three  small 
two-storey  granite  buildings,  in  which  the  cadets 
are  practically  taught  a  thorough  course  of 
military  pyrotechny,  and  the  preparation  and 
packing  of  ammunition  of  all  kinds.  In  the 
Laboratory  Yard,  inclosed  by  a  granite  wall, 
are  the  Gun- Sheds,  and  also  a  large  collection 
of  trophy  guns,  mortars,  howitzers,  &amp;c.,  with  a 
piece  of  the  heavy  chain  stretched  across  the

Hudson  river,  from  West  Point  to  Fort  Con- 
stitution, during  the  revolutionary  war.  This 
was  made  at  the  Stirling  Foundry,  so  called 
from  the  revolutionary  general,  with  whose 
family  I  happen  to  be  connected:  I  therefore 
looked  upon  these  giant  links  with  considerable 
interest. 

Superintendent's,  Professors',  and  Officers' 
Quarters. — These  consist  of  six  moderate  sized 
two-storey  brick  buildings,  three  double  stone 
buildings,  and  seven  small  wooden  buildings. 
As  before  mentioned,  most  of  the  bachelor 
officers  are  at  present  quartered  in  the  cadets' 
barracks.  Should  Congress  add  62  more 
cadets,  as  is  probable,  it  was  proposed  to  erect  a 
large  building  for  the  bachelor  officers,  whose 
rooms  in  the  barracks  would  be  required  for 
these  additional  cadets. 

Hotel. — This  is  a  three- storey  brick  building, 
60  by  50  feet,  with  an  attached  wing  60  by  30 
feet.  The  hotel  was  built  for  the  accommodation 
of  relatives  and  friends  of  cadets;  but  the 
attractions  of  West  Point  are  so  great,  that,  for 
many  years  past,  it  has  been  the  favourite 
resort  of  summer  travellers,  escaping  from 
southern  and  city  heat,  and  desirous  of  daily 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  129 

admiring  the  up-river  view  of  the  Hudson,  of 
world  wide  celebrity,  and  (in  the  opinion  of  the 
natives)  unsurpassed  by  any  river  scene  in  either 
hemisphere. 

Engineer,  Dragoon,  Artillery,  and  Band 
Barracks. — These  are  all  wooden  buildings,  for 
the  accommodation  of  a  company  of  100  sappers, 
miners,  and  pontoniers,  attached  to  the  post, 
to  assist  in  the  instruction  of  cadets  in  practical 
military  engineering;  a  detachment  of  60 
dragoons,  to  act  as  artillery  drivers  and  grooms 
of  the  horses  used  by  cadets  in  cavalry  and  field 
artillery  exercises;  a  detachment  of  72  men 
from  the  artillery,  who  attend  to  no  military 
duties,  but  are  employed  in  the  police  of  the 
post  and  public  buildings,  and  serve  as  artificers 
in  the  quarter-master's  department,  making 
repairs  and  improvements ;  and  the  Military 
Academy  band. 

Dragoon  and  Artillery  Stables. — These  are 
granite  buildings,  but  are  altogether  unsuitable 
and  inadequate  for  the  cavalry  and  artillery 
horses,  of  which  there  were  72.  As  soon 
as  proper  stables  should  be  built,  the  number  of 
horses  was  to  increase. 

Commissary's,  Sutl[  rs\    Shoemakers',   and 

VOL.    I.  K 


130  PASSAGES    IN 

Tailors'  Shops. — These  are  all  small  wooden 
buildings,  the  names  of  which  sufficiently 
indicate  their  purpose. 

Engineer  Equipment  Shed. — This  is  a  large 
two-storey  brick  building,  154  by  54  feet,  in 
which  are  stored  all  the  sappers',  miners'  and 
pontoon  trains  of  the  army. 

Powder  Magazine. — A  large  brick  structure. 
Soldiers'  Guard  House. — That  of  the  engi- 
neers is  of  brick ;  and  that  of  the  dragoons  of 
wood. 

Soldiers'  Hospital. — This  is  a  spacious  brick 
building,  two  storeys  high,  besides  a  good 
basement ;  and,  in  every  respect,  is  one  of  the 
most  convenient  hospitals  in  the  service. 

Besides  these  buildings  above  enumerated, 
there  are  many  small  wooden  buildings,  occupied 
by  laundresses  and  the  various  employes  of  the 
post. 

Strong  efforts  were  being  made  to  get  the 
approval  of  Congress  to  projects  for  the  erection 
of  officers'  quarters,  a  riding  hall,  dragoon  stables 
and  barracks,  and  quarters  and  a  barrack  for  the 
officers  and  men  of  the  company  of  sappers, 
miners,  and  pontoniers. 

We  proceeded  with  Colonel  Lee  to  visit  the 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  131 

halls  of  study.  The  first  we  entered  was  that 
of  Professor  Church  (mathematics),  the  author  of 
a  work  on  Differential  and  Integral  Calculus. 
The  cadets  in  this  "  section,"  were  well-grown 
lads,  dressed  in  grey  short-skirted  jackets,  and 
trousers,  with  buttons  and  black  braid  on  the 
breast,  herring-bone  fashion.  Two  of  the  cadets 
were  required  to  answer  questions  in  descriptive 
geometry:  1st,  to  measure  the  angle  between 
two  oblique  planes ;  2nd,  to  find  the  shortest 
distance  from  a  point  to  a  line.  They  spoke  out 
well,  and  were  ready  with  their  answers ;  they 
used  no  letters  on  the  black-board  (except  in 
writing  their  names),  but  only  pointers.  There 
were  no  desks,  except  the  Professor's,  or  tables  in 
the  hall.  The  cadets  who  were  not  under  exami- 
nation, sat  on  comfortable  seats,  with  backs, 
holding  four  or  five,  and  there  was  a  ventilating 
frame  over  the  door. 

The  next  hall  was  that  of  Professor  Bartlett 
(natural  and  experimental  philosophy),  author  of 
an  elementary  Treatise  on  Optics.  Two  cadets 
were  examined,  one  on  the  polarization  of  light, 
and  the  other  on  achromatics.  After  this,  we  were 
introduced  to  a  gentleman  whose  acquaintance  I 
had  long  desired  to  make,  Professor  Mahan, 

K  2 


132  PASSAGES    IN 

author  of  a  Treatise  on  Field  Fortification,  an 
Elementary  Course  of  Civil  Engineering  for  the 
use  of  Cadets ;  and  a  Treatise  on  Advanced 
Guards,  Out-posts,  &amp;c.  I  considered  his  Field 
Fortification  so  comprehensive,  useful,  and  port- 
able, that  it  has  found  a  place  in  my  portmanteau 
for  many  years.  All  his  works  (which  I  have 
got)  are  prepared  with  great  care,  and  from  the 
best  authorities.  By  the  Professor,  and  his 
assistant,  Lieut.  Smith,  the  cadets  were  examined 
on  the  manner  of  posting  and  handling  detached 
troops  in  presence  of  an  enemy ;  they  seemed 
well  acquainted  with  the  theory  of  thes'e  im- 
portant services. 

In  the  chemical  hall,  the  phenomena  in 
natural  philosophy  were  explained  to  the  cadets ; 
in  the  model  room,  were  specimens  of  Greek 
temples,  of  public  buildings  in  the  States,  of 
different  kinds  of  stone  staircases  (by  the  way, 
too  seldom  used  in  this  country  of  wood  and  of 
highly  inflammable  buildings),  a  model  steam- 
engine,  a  front  of  fortification,  which  had  been 
battered  and  breached,  and  was  ready  for  assault. 
This  had  been  got  at  Chatham,  and  had  been  pre- 
pared by  the  present  Governor  of  Malta,  Sir 
William  Reid,  R.E. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  133 

The  drawing  hall  was  very  interesting ;  it 
was  lofty,  and  well  lighted  and  ventilated.  Each 
student  had  his  separate  seat  and  desk.  Open- 
ing into  the  hall,  and  at  right  angles  to  it,  was  a 
large  room,  on  one  side  of  which  were  hung  up 
coloured  figures  and  landscapes,  copied  by  the 
students  from  first-class  prints  on  the  opposite 
side.  The  copies  are  taken  away  by  the  students 
when  they  leave  the  Academy,  and  their  places 
supplied  by  fresh  drawings. 

Cadets  are  not  admitted  to  the  Academy  till 
after  the  age  of  16,  and  after  passing  a  prelimi- 
nary examination.  Colonel  Lee  said  he  got 
sometimes  applications  from  youths  similar  to 
what  follows : — 

"  Sir, — Being  desirous  to  devote  myself  to  the 
service  of  my  country,  I  request  that  you  will 
send  me  the  regulations  of  the  United  States 
Military  Academy,  that  I  may  prepare  myself  for 
entering  it." 

Unlike  our  military  establishment  of  Sandhurst 
(cujus  pars  fui) — at  which  the  son  of  a  civilian 
pays  £125  a  year  for  his  education,  and  the  sons 
of  officers  from  £40  upwards,  according  to  the 


134  PASSAGES   IN 

rank  of  the  father,  and  the  officers  of  the  senior 
department  £30  annually — the  United  States 
cadets  receive  from  the  Government  24  dollars 
a  month,  wherewith  to  eloth  themselves,  and  pro- 
vide plain  furniture  for  their  dormitories,  in  each 
of  which,  as  before  stated,  are  two  cadets. 

As  a  body,  the  American  cadets  are  steady 
and  orderly,  for,  as  one  said,  "  We  must  get  up 
early,  for  we  have  a  large  territory ;  we  have  to 
cut  down  the  forests,  dig  canals,  and  make  rail- 
roads all  over  the  country." 

"  Voyager  upon  life's  sea, 

To  yourself  be  true ; 
And  where'er  your  lot  may  bey 
Paddle  your  own  canoe. 

"  Would  you  bless  your  fellow  men, 

Heart  and  soul  imbue 
"With  the  holy  task;  and  then, 

Paddle  your  own  canoe."' 

It  is  true  that  some  of  the  graduates  are 
wild,  like  other  youths ;  that  they  get  out  at 
night  by  rope-ladders,  or  otherwise ;  that  they 
ride  the  horses  of  professors  by  moonlight ;  and 
also  occasionally  plunder  orchards  which  may  be 
convenient  to  them; — but  this  is  usual  else- 
where. A  friendly  professor  had  asked  some  of 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  135 

the  cadets  to  his  house,  and  they  danced 
pleasantly  with  his  daughters.  The  professor 
happened  to  boast  of  his  grapes.  Next  evening, 
a  beautiful  serenade  was  given  under  his  front 
windows ;  the  family  assembled  there  to  listen 
and  admire,  while  the  grapes  were  being  silently 
removed  from  the  rear  of  the  premises  !  One 
professor  had  an  original  way  of  preventing 
frivolous  complaints :  if  a  graduate  came  to  him 
to  complain  of  ill-usage  from  another,  he  would 
punish  the  complainant,  and  then  tell  him  to  go 
and  "  fight  it  out  I" 

We  attended  the  riding-school,  which  had  been 
a  gun-shed,  with  two  rows  of  pillars  down  the 
centre.  A  new  building  for  equestrian  exercises 
was  much  required,  though  it  was  difficult  to  get 
an  appropriation  for  this,  and  other  requisites  at 
the  Academy,  from  the  Government.  There 
is  a  party  in  the  States,  who  do  not  see  the 
utility  of  West  Point  at  all,  though  its  value  is 
undeniable,  as  providing  civil  engineers  (as  well  as 
military),  for  vast  regions  still  in  a  state  of  nature. 

Lieut.  Sacket,  of  the  dragoons,  was  the  in- 
structor of  riding, — a  stout,  good-humoured 
German  officer.  The  cadets  rode  without  stir- 
rups, and  in  trousers  reinforced  (strapped)  with 


136  PASSAGES   IN 

cloth  up  the  leg,  and  with  black  leather  round 
the  ankle.  Perhaps  they  have  a  better  grip  of 
"  the  pig  skin  "  this  way,  than  with  the  leather 
up  to  the  fork.  The  cadets  galloped  round  with 
spirit,  and  cut  at  heads  stuffed  with  straw,  on 
the  posts  and  on  the  ground,  gave  point  to  the 
right,  over  the  left  arm,  &amp;c.  The  saddle  resem- 
bled the  hussar,  lined  with  leather  inside,  and 
was  well  raised  oif  the  horse's  back ;  it  was 
complete  with  valise  and  holsters,  in  one  of  which 
last  was  a  pistol,  and  in  the  other  a  currycomb 
and  brush  ;  at  one  side  was  a  ring  for  a  leathern 
pocket  to  contain  two  spare  shoes.  I  had  a 
saddle  weighed — 18lbs.  was  the  result.* 

There  was  a  detachment  of  United  States 
dragoons  at  the  Academy  to  attend  to  the 
horses.  They  were  light,  active-looking  men 
— in  dark  bluejackets,  and  yellow  tape  down 
the  front  and  up  the  back  seams,  forage  caps, 
and  French-gray  trousers.  If  required  to  act 
on  foot  (and  I  earnestly  hope  to  see  a  couple 
of  regiments  raised  in  England,  to  act  on  foot 

*  As  an  old  dragoon,  I  beg  to  recommend,  heartily, 
Captain  Nolan's  complete  and  excellent  work  on  "Ca- 
valry" to  all  sabrevrs.  His  early  death  on  the  plain  of 
Balaclava  we  must  ever  lament. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  137 

and  on  horses'  backs,  as  mounted  rangers,  in 
plain  serviceable  uniform),  they  had  a  handy 
way  of  detaching  the  strapped  spur :  the  trou- 
sers were  buttoned  a  short  way  up  the  leg,  the 
strap  of  the  spur  passed  over  the  lower  button, 
and  served  to  keep  down  the  trousers  in  riding ; 
when  the  spur  was  removed,  the  trousers  were 
as  free  as  those  of  foot  soldiers. 

I  am  sorry  there  is  a  prejudice  against  moun- 
ted rangers  (chasseurs-a-cheval)  in  England. 
From  what  I  have  seen  of  them,  and  having 
served  with  them,  I  think  highly  of  this  arm. 
I  am  convinced,  that  if  a  commanding  officer, 
and  troop-officers  generally,  encouraged  dra- 
goons to  exercise  on  foot  as  well  as  mounted, 
and  set  them  the  example,  we  might  get  dis- 
mounted men  to  skirmish  over  broken  ground, 
(which  cavalry  are  at  present  obliged  to  avoid), 
to  climb  hills,  to  storm  field-works,  to  run,  leap, 
swim.  I  would  abolish  all  useless  ornament 
and  unnecessary  weight  in  equipping  this  corps  ; 
give  the  men  light  leather  helmets  (12  or 
14  oz.)  bronzed,  with  a  lion-fronted  crest, 
sabre  proof,  a  short  scarlet  frock,  bronzed 
buttons,  dark-green  facings,  shoulder  chains, 
such  as  were  in  use  fifty  years  ago,  dark-green

trousers  reinforced,  and  scarlet  stripes,  strap 
spurs.  The  arms,  a  light  fusil  or  short  rifle,

a  small  bayonet  to  fix,  if  charged  whilst  on  foot 
by  cavalry,  brown  belts  (imitation  Russia  lea- 
ther). I  believe  that  men,  turned  out  in  this 
style,  with  military  simplicity,  and  imbued  with 
a  chivalrous  spirit,  would  do  excellent  service ; 
and  such  should  be  our  British  yeomanry,  in 
the  national  scarlet  hunting-frock.  Let  it  be 
tried  ! 

Better  to  run  the  risk,  in  red,  of  a  rifle  bullet, 
than  to  be  shot  by  one's  own  people  for  wearing 
a  foreign  uniform.  I  lately  tried  the  effect  of 
blue,  black,  gray,  and  red  jackets,  at  1000 
yards ;  all  were  faintly  distinguished,  and  nearly 
alike  marked,  but  a  white  belt  across  the  body 
made  a  man  a  target  at  once. 

Let  us  see  now  how  the  West  Point  cadets 
fare.  Their  appearance  bespoke  abundant  and 
wholesome  food.  "  Celui  qui  faire  la  guerre 
doit  commencer  par  le  ventre,"  said  the  great 
Frederick.  The  cooking  department  was  clean 
and  well  managed,  and  it  is  wonderful  what  a 
cooking  stove  can  turn  out  in  America.  We 
tasted  the  bean  soup ;  it  was  capital,  and  there 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  139 

was  variety  in  the  diet.*  In  the  dining-hall  the 
cadets  sat  on  curious  seats,  somewhat  like  piano 
stools,  but  of  iron,  and  with  slender  stems ; 
these  were  adopted  because  wooden  seats  were 
often  broken. 

Major  G.  H.  Thomas,  the  senior  artillery 
officer,  who  had  distinguished  himself  in  the 
Florida  war,  and  at  Monterey  and  Buena  Vista 
in  Mexico,  was  kind  enough  to  cause  a  field-gun 
to  be  brought  out,  horsed  as  for  service,  for  our 
inspection  at  the  laboratory.  From  this  it  was 
seen  that  the  limber  of  the  United  States  field- 
gun  carriages  are  different  from  those  of  the 
English,  by  having  the  boxes  all  in  one ;  they 
are  the  same  as  the  boxes  on  the  wagons,  and 
can  be  shifted  from  the  one  to  the  other  at 
pleasure. 

The  gun  carriage  had  no  small  store-box  on 
the  axle-tree,  and  no  place  for  port-fire-sticks  or 
slow-match — the  gun  being  always  fired  with 
the  lock  and  lanyard.  The  locks  are  so  con- 
structed that,  after  firing  the  cap  (which  is  used 
in  preference  to  the  tube),  the  hammer  leaves

the  vent  uncovered.  The  Americans  claim  this 
invention  for  Enoch  Holden  (though  Colonel 
Dundas,  R.A.  has  a  lock  somewhat  similar) ; 
and  the  Jurors,  at  the  New  York  Crystal  Palace, 
gave  a  bronze  medal  to  Mr.  Holden  for  his 
lock,  which  has  been  thoroughly  tested  and 
approved  in  the  U.  S.  service,  as  Major  Morde- 
cai  of  the  Board  of  Ordnance  at  Washington 
informed  me. 

The  U.  S.  guns  are  the  same  calibre  as  the 
English  field-guns  (6  Ibs.),  but  they  are  con- 
structed so  that  the  difference  of  metal  at  the 
muzzle  and  the  breech  is  only  one  inch  in 
diameter.  The  point-blank  range  is  600  yards 
— point  blank  being  the  distance  from  the 
muzzle  to  the  intersection  of  the  curve  made 
by  a  shot  fired  by  the  line  of  metal,  with  the 
prolongation  of  the  axis  of  the  piece.  The 
shot  are  fastened  to  the  cartridges  when  packed 
in  the  limber.  It  is  believed  that  the  mode  of 
packing  at  Woolwich  is  better  than  that  prac- 
tised in  the  States. 

The  horses  were  yoked  to  the  limber  with 
poles  and  pole-pieces,  and  not  shafts.  The 
yokes  passed  under  the  horses'  necks  in  front 
of  their  breasts,  and  were  attached  to  the 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  141 

hames,  and  the  breeching  continued  round  the 
breast  of  the  horse,  over  the  bottom  of  the 
collar.  The  traces  were  of  black  leather  (brown 
was  proposed) ;  each  horse  was  saddled  so  as  to 
carry  a  rider,  as  in  the  Bengal  horse  artillery. 
On  the  peace  establishment,  there  are  four 
horses  to  a  gun.  The  traces  of  the  leading 
horse  were  connected  with  those  of  the  wheelers. 
The  wheels  were  lighter,  less  dished,  and  had 
smaller  naves  than  the  English.  I  think  the 
American  wheel  generally  is  well  worth  careful 
study  and  attention.  The  gun-carriages  were 
painted  olive ;  each  wagon  carried  a  spare  wheel, 
for  which  an  iron  spindle  was  fixed  to  the  hind- 
part  of  the  axle-tree  of  the  limber. 

The  fuzes  were  cut  into  lengths  calculated  for 
respective  distances,  were  driven  in  pasteboard 
instead  of  wood,  and  did  not  require  to  be  cut 
before  being  inserted  into  the  shell.  The 
lengths  of  range  were  denoted  by  colours, 
white,  red,  or  yellow,  which  every  soldier  could 
easily  understand.  The  fuzes  fix  into  a  wooden 
plug,  which  is  placed  in  the  usual  manner  in 
the  shell  with  the  bursting  powder ;  percussion 
caps  fitted  on  the  hammer,  and  were  made  of 
paper  instead  of  copper.  These  were  carried 


142  PASSAGES   IN 

packed  in  tin  cases  of  1000  ;  and,  during  the 
Mexican  war,  were  never  known  to  explode. 
Lastly,  the  fire  from  the  caps  is  so  strong,  the 
cartridge  need  not  be  pricked. 

We  got  through  a  good  deal  of  work  the 
first  day,  and,  in  the  evening,  dined  at  the 
Superintendent's.  Colonel  Lee  had  a  comfort- 
able, well-furnished  house ;  and  Mrs.  Lee,  of 
the  family  of  Washington,  had,  as  heir-looms, 
besides  some  of  the  plate  of  the  first  President, 
two  large  and  very  interesting  pictures,  one 
representing  George  Washington  as  a  colonel  in 
the  British  army  of  Virginia,  40  years  of  age, 
healthy-looking  and  ruddy,  in  a  small  three- 
cornered  hat ;  silver-bound  blue  coat ;  deep- 
flapped  red  vest,  and  breeches ;  a  sash  across 
his  breast,  worn  Highland  fashion ;  a  sword 
and  gorget ;  his  ruffled  right  hand  is  in  his 
breast,  and  in  his  left  he  holds  at  his  back  a 
fusil.  The  picture  of  his  wife,  Mrs.  Washing- 
ton, in  a  low  dress,  and  pearls  in  her  hair,  a 
flower  in  her  hand,  was  that  of  a  well-looking, 
portly  young  dame,  like  what  a  Scotch  minister, 
a  friend  of  ours,  used  to  remark  of  ladies  of 
this  style  of  beauty,  "  a  remarkably  luxurious 
woman." 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  143 

The  dinner  was  excellent,  and  well-dressed ; 
and  the  Colonel  produced,  as  for  "  favoured 
guests,"  some  Mount  Vernon  wine,  40  years 
old,  which  proved  to  be  capital  Madeira. 
Among  the  party  present,  was  Major  R.  S. 
Garnet,  the  commandant  of  cadets,  and  in- 
structor of  infantry  tactics,  who  had  won  his 
promotion  by  meritorious  services  as  A.D.C.  to 
Generals  Taylor  and  Wool,  in  Mexico. 

In  the  drawing-room,  was  a  fine  picture  of 
the  battle  of  Minden  ;  it  had  hung  in  General 
Washington's  study  at  Mount  Vernon,  for 
many  years.  An  officer  on  horseback,  in  a  blue 
coat  and  chapeau,  is  supposed  to  be  Ferdinand, 
Duke  of  Brunswick,  who  commanded  the 
Hanoverian  troops.  An  officer  on  foot,  in  a 
scarlet  coat,  and  uncovered,  may  be  Lord 
George  Sackville,  or  else  the  Marquis  of  Granby. 
The  first  was  censured,  and  the  latter  com- 
mended for  his  conduct.  A  brown  horse, 
belonging  to  the  British  officer,  is  prominently 
placed  in  the  foreground,  and  has  a  very  satis- 
fied air,  for  some  unknown  reason.  The  pain- 
ter's name  seems  to  contain  four  letters,  the  first 
and  last  H  and  s;  the  second  and  third  may 


144  PASSAGES    IN 

be  u  or  a.  "  Haas,"  or  "  Haus,"  was  a  painter 
of  eminence  about  the  time  of  Minden. 

Amongst  the  other  matters  discussed  after 
dinner,  was  that  of  the  new  mysteries  of  table- 
turning  ;  it  had  been  tried  at  the  Academy,  and 
quite  puzzled  the  most  scientific  professors. 
There  was  also  a  story  current  of  a  gentleman, 
an  enthusiastic  admirer  of  Byron,  whose 
daughter,  being  a  spirit-rapper,  had  been 
induced  to  call  up  the  poet,  who  then  supplied 
the  lines  omitted  in  various  of  his  stanzas. 
"  Curious  if  true !" 

In  the  library  of  the  Academy,  we  saw  a 
very  useful  publication,  and  one  much  required 
in  other  armies,  to  produce  strict  uniformity  in 
dress.  It  is  entitled  "  Regulations  for  the 
Uniform  and  Dress  of  the  Army  of  the 
United  States,  from  the  Original  Text  and 
Drawings  in  the  War  Department,"  very  well 
brought  out,  and  published  by  the  enterprising 
military  furnishers,  Messrs.  Horstmann  and 
Allien, 

A  General  Order  says,  "  1.  The  following 
description  of  the  uniform  of  the  army  of  the 
United  States  having  been  approved  of  by  the 
Secretary  at  War,  is  published  for  general  in-

formation,  and  will  be  strictly  conformed  to. 
Colonels  of  regiments  and  corps  will  rigidly 
enforce  this  order;  and  Generals  and  other 
inspecting  officers,  will  notice  all  deviations  from 
it.  2.  Every  departure  from  the  established 
dress,  will  subject  the  offender  to  trial  by  court- 
martial,  for  disobedience  of  orders."  All  offi- 
cers now  wear  a  frock  coat  of  dark-blue  cloth  ; 
the  skirt  extends  from  two-thirds  to  three-fourths 
of  the  distance  from  the  top  of  the  hip  to  the 
bend  of  the  knee;  single  breasted  for  captains 
and  lieutenants,  and  double-breasted  for  all 
other  grades. 

The  men  also  wear  frock  coats,  and  look  well 
in  them,  as  the  British  now  do,  in  well-fitting 
scarlet  frocks,  instead  of  the  tape-covered  coatee. 
The  buttons  are  brass ;  the  trousers  of  "  sky- 
blue  mixture,"  for  regimental  officers  and  men, 
and  dark-blue  for  all  other  officers;  the  cap 
for  officers  and  men,  generals  and  all,  is  ( like  the 
French  cap  in  shape),  of  dark-blue  cloth,  very 
light,  and  with  a  horizontal  peak.  I  prefer  a 
light  leather  helmet  to  this,  as  there  is  no  pro- 
tection from  sun  and  sabre,  in  a  cap  :  "  having 
suffered,  I  speak."  The  back  of  the  head, 
particularly,  is  much  exposed  in  a  French  cap.

Sir  Charles  Napier's  hunting  cap,  with  a  white 
cover,  and  peaks  before  and  behind,  is  excellent 
for  service  in  the  East.  A  leathern  helmet  I 
had  made,  weighing  14  ozs.,  has  the  peak  con- 
tinued all  round,  narrow  over  the  ears,  and 
broad  at  the  back  and  front ;  it  gives  effectual 
shelter  from  the  sun  and  rain,  and  is  ever- 


On  the  second  day,  we  visited  the  fencing 
hall,  which  was  under  an  athletic  professor, 
Monsieur  Patrice  de  Janon,  and  saw  some  fierce 
encounters.  Perhaps  it  is  the  climate,  the  ex- 
tremes of  heat  and  cold,  in  many  of  the  States, 
which  disinclines  the  youth  to  the  active  exer- 
cises which  are  in  fashion  in  Britain,  of  hunting, 
rowing,  cricket,  fives,  &amp;c.  ;  but  the  authorities 
of  West  Point  have  wisely  provided  the  manly, 
soldier-like,  and  useful  exercises  of  riding  and 
fencing,  which  are  daily  practised  for  some 
months,  so  as  to  strengthen  and  improve  the 
whole  physique.  I  remarked,  that  the  masks 
were  well- contrived  with  projections  to  protect 
the  ears,  and  the  flannel  jackets  were  guarded 
on  the  right  breast  and  upper  arm,  with  leather 
sewn  on  them. 

We  strolled  towards  the  grave-yard,  and  saw 


THE   LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  147 

some  affecting  memorials  to  officers  and  to 
cadets.  The  tombs  converged  to  a  centre,  and 
were  not  disposed  east  and  west,  as  in  "  the 
old  country."  One  inscription  ran  thus,  suffi- 
ciently touching,  "  Dear  little  Sam,  the  child  of 
H.  C.  and  Harriet  Bartlett."  The  darling  of 
his  parents  required  no  other  "  storied  urn." 

The  favourite  amusement  in  the  States  is 
bowls,  and  there  was  a  good  bowling  saloon  at 
"the  Point."  The  Superintendent  was  so 
obliging  as  to  appoint  different  officers  to  ac- 
company us,  and  as  it  rained  in  the  afternoon, 
we  were  asked,  in  the  phraseology  of  the  coun- 
try, "  if  we  felt  like  bowls."  We  said  we  did  ; 
and  adjourning  to  the  alley,  we  played  with 
bowls  at  large  "  ten  pins,"  set  up  at  the  end  of 
the  raised  wooden  course,  the  balls  being 
returned  to  us  along  an  inclined  trough.  There 
is  a  good  deal  of  crash,  noise,  and  exhilaration 
about  bowls,  as  played  in  the  States. 

In  the  evening,  we  spent  a  very  pleasant  time 
at  the  officer's  mess,  held  in  a  large  apartment, 
well  lighted  and  warm,  the  fare  good  and  abun- 
dant, and  the  Madeira  excellent ;  item,  cham- 
pagne. The  officers  having  no  shell-jacket,  as

mess  purposes  chiefly,  but  not  suited  for  the 
streets,  if  a  man  is  "  wonderfully  made,"  before 
and  behind),  dined  in  their  smart  blue  frocks 
and  shoulder-straps.  Table-d 'notes  being  so 
much  in  fashion  in  the  States,  gave  rise,  per- 
haps, to  peculiarities  in  discussing  food,  when 
sometimes  there  may  be  "  short  commons ;" 
and  one  requires  "  to  look  a-head,"  or  u  come 
short."  Thus,  after  soup,  and  being  helped 
to  roast  beef,  a  waiter  (the  word  servant  is  anti- 
republican)  said,  "  Take  a  chop,  sir,  with  your 
beef?"  We  did,  and  also  helped  ourselves, 
when  offered,  to  potatoes,  apple  sauce,  and 
maccaroni.  I  would  rather  use  these  mixtures, 
than  sit  down  to  underdone  meat,  the  trail  of 
woodcock,  or  to  "  high"  grouse ;  the  taste  for 
which,  in  England,  is  to  me  incomprehensible. 
We  finished  with  celery,  cheese,  and  coffee,  and 
adjourned  to  play  billiards  in  the  ante-room. 

Many  of  our  new  friends  (and  I  am  happy  to 
say  that  the  most  friendly  feeling  prevails  be- 
tween the  officers  of  the  United  States  army 
and  our  own  people  generally  —  "  may  the 
hatchet  never  be  unburied  again" — there  is 
plenty  of  elbow  room  for  us  all)  had  been 
engaged  in  the  Mexican  war,  as  I  previously 


THE  LIFE    OF   A   SO.LDIER.  149 

noticed ;  and  they  were  pleased  to  tell,  and  we 
to  hear,  of  some  of  their  experiences  in  the 
country  of  the  Aztecs.  One  thing  they  did  not 
seem  particularly  to  relish  on  service,  was  the 
clashing  of  rank  of  the  militia  and  volunteers 
with  that  of  the  regulars.  After  a  man  has 
engaged  in  the  regular  service,  and  prepared 
himself  by  years  of  careful  study  at  West  Point, 
to  have  some  of  the  glory  and  honour  taken 
away  from  him  by  a  gentleman  fresh  from  a 
store,  and  "  known  on  'Change,"  was  rather 
hard ;  but  the  regulars  have  their  revenge,  as 
occurrences  like  this  took  place  sometimes. 
General  "  Downy,"  of  the  militia,  (lauded  in  a 
History  of  the  War),  in  passing  a  volunteer 
sentry,  who  was  lounging  on  the  trail  of  a  gun, 
called  out,  "  Stand  up,  sir,  and  salute,  or  I'll 
take  you  off  your  post,"  whereupon  the  sentry, 
applying  his  thumb  to  his  nose,  said,  "That 
won't  do,  Gen'ril,  I  tell  ye ;  I  was  posted  here 
by  a  regular  lootenant !" 

There  was  a  fighting  parson,  with  the  army 
in  Mexico,  who  was  a  character,  and  a  great 
favourite.  Thus,  when  the  column  came  to  a 
stream  which  the  men  hesitated  to  cross,  he 
jumped  into  it  up  to  his  middle,  and  handed 


150  PASSAGES   IN 

the  muskets  across  dry,  in  presence  of  the 
enemy,  and  exhorting  the  men  thus,  "  Come, 
my  boys,  fight  the  good  fight,  put  your  trust  in 
God,  and  keep  your  powder  dry,"  then,  thinking 
he  had  said  too  much,  he  would  suddenly  hold 
up  his  hands,  and  say  with  pious  horror, 
"  What  a  terrible  thing  is  this  war  !rr 

In  discussing  the  powers  of  endurance  of 
different  men,  one  of  the  officers  remarked,  "  I 
don't  care  how  large,  or  how  small  a  man  is,  he 
will  stand  any  fatigue  under  heaven,  if  he  has- 
only  grit,"  (stamina). 

Some  tales  of  the  Cumanchee  Indians  of 
Texas,  were  interesting.  The  Texan  Rangers 
found  that  the  best  way  to  defend  themselves 
against  the  Cumanchees  was  with  a  revolver 
and  a  bowie  knife.  The  revolver  carried  well 
for  100  yards,  and  more,  whereas  the  Cuman- 
ehee  arrows  reached  hardly  seventy  yards,  to 
kill ;  and  though  these  Indians  are  wonderful 
horsemen,  riding  fearlessly,  shooting  arrows  as 
fast  as  revolvers  can  be  discharged,  and  cover- 
ing themselves  with  their  horses'  necks,  yet 
they  stand  in  wholesome  fear  of  the  new  fire- 
arms. The  Americans  are  partial  to  using 
buck-shot :  they  think  there  is  nothing  like 


THE   LIFE    OF  A   SOLDIER.  151 

tying  up  three  buck-shot  with  a  ball;  if  the 
ball  misses,  the  shot  may  hit  men  right  and 
left;  if  the  shot  did  not  kill,  it  disabled,  and 
men  went  out  of  action.  I  have  seen  cartridges 
made  up  of  twelve  buck-shot,  three  and  three, 
for  close  quarters. 

The  Cumanchees  are  great  horse  thieves, 
and  have  been  compelled  of  late  years  to  eat 
horses  for  food.  However,  they  relish  this  fare 
very  much,  particularly  the  part  under  the  mane  ; 
but,  as  we  experienced  in  Africa,  when  compelled 
to  eat  portions  of  some  score  of  zebras,  (among 
other/era  nature]  the  taste  of  thefleshis  disagree- 
ably sweetish,  leaves  a  taste  in  the  mouth,  and 
it  is  not  advisable  to  smell  it.  The  liver  used  to 
be  the  delicacy  of  the  zebra.  In  their  forays,  the 
Cumanchees  sometimes  kill  the  settlers,  and 
carry  off  the  white  women.  One  of  the  officers 
at  West  Point  had  seen  a  white  woman  retaken. 
She  looked  squalid  and  miserable,  had  a  skin 
round  her  loins,  and  had  been  a  slave  to  a 
squaw ;  she  was  so  overjoyed  at  her  release, 
that  the  soldiers  shed  tears  from  sympathy. 

On  the  third  day  of  our  agreeable  stay  at 
West  Point,  the  morning  being  beautiful  and 
clear,  and  the  willow-trees  showing  the  bright 
green  of  returning  spring  (it  was  the  16th  of 


152  PASSAGES    IN 

April),  I  was  up  at  five,  and  climbed  the  height 
on  which  are  the  remains  of  the  interesting  old 
revolutionary  post,  Fort  Putnam.  Trees  grew 
on  the  ruined  walls,  the  casemates  dropped 
with  water,  there  were  wooded  and  lonely  hills 
around,  and  the  deep  Hudson  below;  the  air 
was  fresh  and  elastic. 

Oh,  here  is  calm  t  Still  hold  afar, 

Old  world,  thy  hard,  unsparing  hand — 
We  covet  not  thy  flying  car, 

That,  like  an  earthquake,  rends  the  land. 
No ;  rather  we  will  wander  hence, 

O'er  breezy  heights,  through  valleys  green, 
With  nought  to  blind  or  jar  the  sense ; 

And  in  the  soul,  with  joy  intense, 
Receive  the  moral  of  the  scene. 

On  a  signal-staff  was  this  civil  injunction  : 
"This  signal  is  the  property  of  the  United 
States;  all  persons  visiting  it  are  respectfully 
requested  not  to  interfere  with  or  disturb  its 
adjustment,"  it  would  hardly  do  on  this  side  of 
the  Atlantic  "  offenders  will  be  prosecuted 
with  the  utmost  rigour  of  the  law."  The 
"  offenders"  might  take  Lynch  law  into  their 
own  hands. 

Descending  the  hill,  I  was  attracted  by  the 
sound  of  martial  music.  I  asked  a  cadet  what 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  153 

it  was.  He  said  it  was  for  guard  mounting.  I 
saw  a  suspicious-looking  lump  in  his  cheek  — 
what  one  expects  to  observe  in  that  of  a  Jack 
Tar ;  and  if  an  Irish  echo  had  been  asked, 
"This  is  what?  "  it  might  have  replied,  if  it  un- 
derstood Latin,  "  Quid."  The  drum-major 
was  "  got  up  "  with  a  bear-skin,  &amp;c.,  in  the 
French  style,  and  the  band  were  distinguished  by 
broad  yellow  lapels  to  their  blue  frocks.  The 
cadet  officers  on  duty  for  the  day,  marched  past 
with  black  cocks'-tail  feathers  in  their  chakos, 
and  saluted  by  dropping  their  Roman-like 
sword,  without  raising  the  left  hand  to  the  peak, 
as  with  us,  and  which,  by  the  way,  tends  to  un- 
steady the  pace. 

I  will  now  give,  as  concisely  as  possible,  some 
of  the  regulations  of  the  War  Department  relative 
to  the  U.  S.  Military  Academy.  And  first,  as  to 
the  admission  of  cadets  : — Each  congressional 
and  territorial  district,  including  the  district  of 
Columbia,  is  entitled  to  have  a  cadet  at  the 
Military  Academy,  and  no  more.  The  members 
of  Congress  nominate  the  cadets  ;  and  there  are 
ten  appointments  besides  allowed, — these  are 
termed  "  at  large."  The  qualifications  are,  that 
the  candidates  must  be -over  sixteen  years  of  age, 


154  PASSAGES   IN 

and  under  twenty-one,  at  the  time  of  entrance 
into  the  Academy ;  must  be,  at  least,  five  feet 
in  height,  and  without  disease  or  bodily  infirmity. 
They  must  be  able  to  read  and  write  well,  and 
perform,  with  facility  and  accuracy,  the  various 
operations  of  the  first  four  rules  of  arithmetic, — 
of  reduction,  of  simple  and  compound  proportion, 
and  of  vulgar  and  decimal  fractions. 

During  the  months  of  July  and  August,  the 
cadets  are  engaged  in  the  military  duties  and 
exercises,  living  in  camp.  The  academic  exer- 
cises commence  in  September.  The  half-year 
examination  takes  place  in  January.  If  any 
have  been  found  unable  to  master  the  course, 
they  are  returned  to  their  homes.  "  The  nation 
sends  these  young  men  to  the  Military  Academy, 
supports  and  pays  them  adequately,  and  opens 
to  them  an  honourable  profession,  in  the  expec- 
tation that  their  best  efforts  will  be  given  to 
qualify  themselves  for  the  higher  duties  of  the 
military  service.  Those  who  will  not,  or  cannot, 
profit  by  these  generous  provisions,  should  not 
occupy  the  place  of  those  who  will  and  can." 
In  June  is  held  the  annual  examination,  which 
is  also  a  searching  one ;  more  than  one-third  of 
those  who  receive  appointments  fail  to  graduate. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  155 

Yet  though  these  may  have  been  averse  to 
mathematical  investigation,  their  mental  abilities 
may  enable  them  to  succeed  in  other  walks  of 
life. 

During  the  four  years  of  the  course  of  study, 
the  first  or  senior  class  includes  engineering  and 
the  science  of  war,  ethics,  infantry  tactics,  artillery, 
mineralogy,  and  geology.  The  second  class, 
natural  and  experimental  philosophy,  chemistry, 
and  drawing.  The  third  class,  mathematics,  the 
French  language,  and  drawing.  The  fourth 
class,  mathematics,  the  French  language,  and 
English  studies. 

In  running  over  the  extracts  from  the  regu- 
lations of  the  U.  S.  M.  Academy,  I  find  that  no 
married  person  shall  be  admitted  as  a  cadet ;  and 
if  a  cadet  get  married,  he  must  immediately 
resign  his  appointment  to  the  institution. 

Offences  are  divided  into  seven  grades, 
namely : — 

Mutinous   conduct,     .     .10  Demerits. 
Disobedience  of  orders,     .     8       „ 
Visiting  in  study  hours,  .     5       „ 
Absence  from  drill,  4       „ 

Idleness  in  Academy,  .     .     3       „ 


156  PASSAGES    IN 

Inattention  under  arms,  .     2  Demerits. 
Late  at  roll-call,     ...     1        „ 

If  any  one  year  a  cadet's  offences  number  200, 
he  is  dismissed  the  Academy ;  each  year  the 
demerits  count  more,  one-sixth,  one-third,  and 
one-half  (the  last  year).  Cadets  may  obtain 
leave  during  the  encampments";  but  if  they 
overstay  their  leave,  without  good  reason,  they 
are  "  dropped  from  the  rolls."  A  monthly 
stoppage  of  two  dollars  is  made  from  the  twenty- 
four  dollars'  pay  of  the  cadet,  to  purchase  a 
uniform  and  equipments,  on  receiving  a  com- 
mission. The  punishments  are,  privation  of 
recreation,  extra  hours  of  duty,  reprimands, 
confinement  to  room  or  tent,  confinement  in 
light  prison,  in  dark  prison,  private  and  public  dis- 
mission. No  cadet  is  allowed  to  drink  intoxicating 
liquors,  or  to  gamble,  or  use  tobacco,  or  cook 
in  his  room,  or  keep  a  waiter  (servant),  horse, 
or  a  dog.  Cadets  must  attend  Divine  service  on 
Sundays  (the  chaplain  was  a  Presbyterian 
clergyman  at  the  time  of  my  visit),  no  fighting 
is  allowed  with  deadly  weapons,  and  all  combina- 
tions are  prohibited. 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  15? 

The  cadets  are  organised  into  a  battalion  of 
four  companies,  officered  by  the  cadets,  who  are 
also  made  sergeants  and  corporals.  The  reveille' 
sounds  at  five  A.M.  from  1st  of  April  to  the  1st 
of  November,  and  at  six  the  rest  of  the  year. 
At  ten  P.M.  "  Taps,"  when  all  lights  are 
extinguished.  "  Peas  upon  a  trencher "  is  the 
signal  for  breakfast  at  seven  A.M.,  and  "roast 
beef"  for  dinner  at  one  P.M.  The  hair  of  the 
cadets  is  cut  close  behind,  and  no  moustaches 
worn.  With  regard  to  the  "  police  of  quarters  " 
— as  the  local  term  is — cadets  arrange  their 
bedding  and  clean  their  lamps,  &amp;c.  The  (cadet) 
officer  of  the  day  notes  all  irregularities  in  the 
rooms. 

Among  the  cadets  at  West  Point,  there  was 
a  Mormon  from  the  Salt  Lake ;  also,  Jerome 
Napoleon  Bonaparte,  a  son  of  the  ex-king, 
Lucien  ;  he  had  just  got  his  commission.  His 
general  merits  stood  thus:  on  the  last  roll  of  the 
first  class,  eleven ;  his  age  twenty-one  and  a 
half;  and  his  demerits,  for  the  year,  only  fifteen. 
He  is  likely  to  do  credit  in  the  East  to  his 
distinguished  family. 

Having  concluded  our  very  gratifying  visit  to 
the  West  Point,  we  bid  adieu  to  our  new 


158  PASSAGES   IN 

friends ;  and,  whilst  my  brother  officers  went  to 
New  York,  to  spend  a  few  pleasant  days  there, 
I  travelled  north,  and  visited,  at  Troy,  the  senior 
officer  next  to  the  commander-in-chief  of  the 
American  army,  an  old  and  esteemed  friend, 
Major-General  J.  E.  Wool.  We  had  travelled 
together  formerly,  and  I  had  been  presented  by 
him  to  the  celebrated  President,  General  Jackson, 
at  Washington.  The  honourable  career  of 
General  Wool  is  as  follows: — Entering  the 
United  States  army,  in  1812,  he  distinguished 
himself,  and  was  severely  wounded  at  the  battle 
of  Queenstown  heights  (where  the  gallant  Sir 
Isaac  Brock  fell,  and  is  interred),  he  became  Bt. 
Lieut.-Colonel  for  Plattsburgh,  for  several  years 
was  Inspector-General  of  the  Army,  and  received 
the  rank  of  Major-General  for  gallant  and 
meritorious  conduct  in  the  battle  of  Buena  Vista, 
in  Mexico. 

I  was  glad  to  see  that  the  General  was  still 
hale,  strong,  and  cheerful,  notwithstanding  his 
arduous  career.  His  good  judgment  and  ma- 
nagement were  particularly  evinced  when  he  led  a 
division  of  3,000  regulars  and  volunteers  across 
the  Rio  Grande,  into  the  heart  of  Mexico,  to 
Chihuahua  and  back.  When  he  was  about  to 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  159 

cross  the  frontier  of  the  enemy's  country,  a 
number  of  the  volunteers  of  his  force  (whom  he 
had  brought  into  order,  and  had  disciplined 
sufficiently  to  enable  them  to  take  care  of  them- 
selves) came  to  him,  and  said,  "  General  we 
must  help  ourselves  now."  He  replied,  "  No,  I 
allow  no  plundering;  we  are  to  pay  for  our 
supplies."  Hitherto,  all  the  supplies,  by  long 
trains  of  wagons,  had  been  derived  from  the 
States;  he  knew  that  these  could  not  much 
longer  be  kept  up,  and  that  it  was  desirable  to 
conciliate  the  Mexicans,  to  prevent  a  system  of 
reprisal  for  injuries,  guerilla  warfare,  and  assas- 
sination of  stragglers.  The  General,  accordingly, 
called  all  the  volunteers  together,  and  said, 
"  Those  who  do  not  agree  to  my  terms  of  no 
plunder,  had  better  go  back."  He  knew  that 
they  had  come  for  fame,  and  would  have  been 
ashamed  to  return  without  a  campaign.  They 
promised  obedience ;  there  was  no  plunder,  no 
punishment,  and  his  troops,  on  their  long 
marches,  were  abundantly  supplied  by  the 
Mexicans. 

At  the  great  battle  of  Buena  Vista,  General 
Wool,  in  conjunction  with  General  Taylor  (after- 
wards President  of  the  United  States),  defeated, 


160  PASSAGES    IN 

after  a  protracted  struggle  20,000  Mexicans, 
under  Santa  Anna;  the  Americans  numbered 
about  4,500.  General  Wool,  on  that  occasion, 
exposed  himself  fearlessly  everywhere  in  the 
field,  and  displayed  the  greatest  bravery  and 
military  skill.  He  thus  holds  a  distinguished 
place  in  the  annals  of  his  country,  which,  in 
perpetual  alliance  with  Great  Britain — "the 
nursing  mother  of  infant  nations  " — it  is  to  be 
hoped,  will  promote  the  arts  of  peace,  extend 
liberty  without  licentiousness,  morality,  and  our 
holy  religion,  to  the  ends  of  the  earth.

visit  of  the  Italian  patriot,  Gavazzi,  to  Canada 
was  enacted ;  but  years  will  elapse  before  its 
traces  are  obliterated  from  the  recollection  of 
the  inhabitants,  and  the  deplorable  results  of 

VOL.    I.  M 


162  PASSAGES    IN 

the  evil  passions  then  called  into  active  exer- 
cise. 

I  desire  to  place  on  record  (having  been 
requested  to  do  so)  a  succinct  narrative  of  what 
fell  under  my  observation  on  the  above  sad  and 
memorable  occasion ;  but  first  a  short  outline 
of  the  history  of  Gavazzi. 

Alessandro  Gavazzi,  one  of  the  most  remark- 
able men  of  the  nineteenth  century,  was  born 
at  Bologna,  in  Italy,  his  father  having  held  there 
the  offices  of  judge,  peace  magistrate,  and  pro- 
fessor of  law.  Alessandro  was  the  second  of 
twenty  children,  and  was  remarkable  in  his 
youth  for  his  talents  and  for  his  powerful  frame. 
In  1853,  he  seemed  a  man  of  forty-five  years 
of  age,  with  dark  hair,  well-formed  head,  pro- 
minent nose  inclined  to  aquiline,  in  good  case 
though  not  too  fleshy,  and  in  height  about  five 
feet  ten  inches. 

At  the  age  of  sixteen,  Gavazzi  became  a 
monk  of  the  Barnabite  Order,  devoting  himself 
to  study.  At  the  age  of  twenty,  he  was  ap- 
pointed to  fill  the  chair  of  rhetoric  and  belles- 
lettres  in  the  college  of  Caravaggi,  at  Naples. 
His  oratorical  powers  being  remarkable,  we  next 
find  him  as  a  teacher  and  preacher  at  Leghorn ; 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  163 

but  not  being  able  to  reserve  to  himself  the 
expression  of  fervent  sentiments  of  patriotism, 
he  was  forced  to  quit  Leghorn.  He  then 
itinerated  in  Piedmont,  preaching  honour,  virtue, 
the  love  of  country,  and  the  fear  of  God,  to 
numerous  audiences.  He  now  incurred  the  op- 
position and  animosities  of  the  Jesuits,  who 
contrived,  through  the  minister  for  foreign 
affairs,  Margherita,  to  get  him  expelled  from 
Piedmont,  which  was  for  his  enemies  a  great 
triumph. 

At  Parma  he  lived  four  years;  and  in  the 
zenith  of  his  power  and  his  popularity,  he  has 
been  known  there  to  have  addressed  audiences 
the  almost  incredible  number  of  ten  times 
in  one  day  —  a  superhuman  effort.  It  was 
at  Parma  where  he  had  such  powerful  effect 
over  the  prisoners,  to  whom  he  became  chaplain- 
extraordinary.  At  Ancona,  the  fiery  outbursts 
of  his  zeal,  and  the  free  expression  of  his  liberal 
sentiments,  occasioned  his  being  imprisoned  by 
direction  of  Pope  Gregory  XVI.  He  remained 
in  durance  till  Pope  Pius  IX.  assumed  the  tiara, 
by  whose  directions  Gavazzi  was  liberated. 
After  various  fortunes  in  life  of  intense  excite- 
ment, whilst  Italy  was  struggling  for  liberty,

164  PASSAGES   IN 

Gavazzi  found  himself  again  imprisoned  in  the 
dungeons  of  Cometo,  among  malefactors  of  the 
worst  description.  From  thence,  eventually 
liberated,  he  repaired  to  the  eternal  city,  to 
Rome,  at  the  time  of  the  short-lived  republic. 
Rome,  attacked  by  the  French,  was  defended 
with  enthusiasm  for  a  time,  till  at  length  she 
fell,  and  the  leaders  of  her  defenders,  amongst 
whom  Gavazzi  was  the  chaplain-general,  being 
dispersed,  Gavazzi  came  to  England,  where  he 
was  received  cordially  by  many  new  friends; 
thence  he  proceeded  to  the  United  States,  where 
his  reception  was  most  encouraging;  after 
which  he  accepted  invitations  to  visit  Canada, 
his  mission  apparently  being  to  preach  a  cru- 
sade against  Popery,  as  he  stated  it  was  ini- 
mical to  the  liberty  of  the  people. 

Gavazzi  declared  that  he  was  neither  an 
apostate  nor  a  sceptic,  neither  a  follower  of 
Luther  or  Calvin,  but  simply  a  disciple  of  the 
Catholic  Church  founded  in  purity  by  St. 
Peter. 

It  would  be  well  if  these  maxims  could 
be  adopted  and  followed  out  by  energetic 
minds,  at  the  same  time  discretion  tempering 
their  zeal. 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  165 

"In  the  world's  broad  field  of  battle, 

In  the  bivouac  of  life, 
Be  not  like  dumb,  driven  cattle, 

Be  a  Christian  in  the  strife  1 
Lives  of  great  men  all  remind  us 

We  #an  make  our  lives  sublime ; 
And,  departing,  leave  behind  us 

Footprints  on  the  sands  of  time." 

Gavazzi's  first  lecture  in  Canada  was  delivered 
at  Toronto,  where,  the  Protestants  and  Orange- 
men being  in  the  majority,  no  molestation  was 
offered  to  him.  From  Toronto,  passing  Mont- 
real, he  appeared  at  Quebec,  the  ancient  capital 
of  the  province,  where  the  French  Canadians 
and  Irish  Roman  Catholics,  in  the  population 
of  40,000  souls,  much  outnumbered  the  other 
denominations.  It  was  dangerous  ground  for 
him,  particularly  among  such  an  excitable  class 
as  the  lower  order  of  Roman  Catholics. 

The  first  lecture,  which,  doubtless,  some  of 
the  Irishmen  attended,  to  ascertain  the  nature 
of  his  oratory,  was  in  the  Wesleyan  Church. 
The  sheriff,  Sewell,  was  in  the  chair;  but  this 
lecture,  as  probably  there  was  no  time  to  orga- 
nize opposition,  was  allowed  to  proceed  without 
interruption.  However,  broad  hints  were  given 
that  there  might  be  danger  if  another  lecture 


166  PASSAGES   IN 

were  attempted.  The  Wesley ans  declined  again 
to  risk  their  handsome  chapel,  and,  on  the  6th 
June,  1853,  the  second  lecture  took  place  in 
the  "  Chalmers"  Free  Church — a  very  neat  and 
appropriate  building,  ornamented  with  Gothic 
spire  and  windows. 

At  eight  o'clock  in  the  evening,  a  large  and 
highly  respectable  audience  of  ladies  and  gentle- 
men assembled  in  the  Free  Church.  The 
subject  chosen  for  lecture,  as  had  been  intimated 
by  hand-bills,  was — "  The  Ancient  and  Modern 
Inquisition,"  A  number  of  rough-looking  fel- 
lows, evidently  bent  on  mischief,  collected  in  the 
street  and  about  the  door  of  the  church.  The 
police  were  also  there,  in  their  blue  frocks,  and 
armed  with  truncheons ;  but,  as  it  unfortunately 
happens  here  and  elsewhere,  they  were  chosen  not 
by  the  general  government,  but  were  put  into 
their  offices  by  the  members  of  the  corporation, 
and  they  were  too  often  connected  by  feeling  and 
by  religion  with  rioters  aud  indifferent  char- 
acters. 

The  lecturer  described  in  fearful  terms  the 
severities  practised  in  the  Inquisition — among 
others,  the  torture  by  water,  the  face  held  up, 
the  water  dropping  on  the  cloth  muffling  the 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  167 

mouth,  and  he  acted  the  gradual  choking  of  the 
sufferer  with  such  effect,  that  one  lady  we  know 
(and  there  may  have  been  others)  left  the 
church  overcome  by  her  feelings. 

Nine  o'clock  had  struck;  it  had  become 
dusk ;  when,  in  talking  of  Ribbonism  in  Ireland, 
that  combination  for  murder  and  violence, 
Gavazzi  asserted  that  the  priests  did  not  try  to 
put  it  down,  when  a  voice  from  the  body  of  the 
church  called  out,  "  It's  a  lie  !"  whereupon  there 
was  a  cry  of  "  Turn  him  out"  The  interrup- 
tion seemed  to  be  a  signal  for  a  general  out- 
break. The  greatest  confusion  and  tumult  im- 
mediately ensued,  and  a  volley  of  stones  was 
thrown  from  the  outside  through  the  windows 
and  in  at  the  doors  towards  the  pulpit.  Dr. 
Cook,  the  eloquent  and  excellent  minister  of 
St.  Andrew's  Church,  got  into  the  precentor's 
or  clerk's  seat,  and  attempted  in  vain  to  address 
the  excited  multitude.  The  sheriff  Sewell, 
and  Mr.  R.  Symes,  the  energetic  magistrate, 
tried  also  to  restore  order ;  but  rioters  from  the 
outside  rushing  past  the  unresisting  police,  and 
joined  with  those  already  inside,  first  hurled 
Bibles  and  Psalm  Books  from  the  pews  at  the 
head  of  Gavazzi,  and  then  attempted  to  storm 


168  PASSAGES   IN 

the  pulpit,  which  is  lofty,  stands  out  from  the 
wall,  and  is  ascended  by  two  stairs  in  the  rear. 
The  design  of  the  rioters  seemed  to  be  to  tear 
Gavazzi  from  the  pulpit,  and  to  beat  him  to 
death  with  bludgeons  on  the  spot.  He  knew 
he  was  in  great  peril,  and  that  the  most 
strenuous  efforts  were  required  to  preserve  his 
life.  His  muscular  power  and  well-knit  frame 
stood  him  now  in  good  stead.  Seizing  the 
chair  which  stood  in  the  pulpit,  he  struck  down 
the  first  rioters  who  ascended  the  stair,  and  he 
battled  with  this  weapon  valiantly.  A  gallant 
sergeant  of  artillery,  "  Lawson"  by  name,  an 
honour  to  his  corps  (and  afterwards  presented 
with  a  gold  watch  by  some  of  his  civilian  ad- 
mirers), seeing  the  fearful  odds  mustering 
against  Gavazzi,  sprang  to  the  rescue,  got  into 
the  pulpit  with  Gavazzi,  and  fought  by  his  side. 
His  aid  was  very  important ;  likewise  that  of  Cap- 
tain Haultain,  R.A.  and  Lieutenant  Noble,  R.E. 
The  chair  was  torn  from  Gavazzi's  grasp, 
when  he  seized  a  stool,  and  wielded  it  also  with 
effect ;  till  his  assailants,  climbing  up  behind 
when  he  was  occupied  in  front,  overpowered  him, 
and  the  sergeant  and  the  padre  were  hurled  out 
of  the  pulpit  by  the  legs.  Fortunately  there 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  169 

was  a  crowd  of  rioters  and  Gavazzi's  friends 
struggling  below.  He  fell  fifteen  feet,  on  their 
heads,  and  thus  escaped  death  from  the  fall. 
Regaining  his  feet,  he  hurried  into  the  base- 
ment, where  his  secretary  was  also  carried, 
though  with  black  eyes  and  much  bruised. 

The  melee  went  on  for  some  time  in  the 
church,  and  outside  some  of  the  gentlemen 
among  the  audience,  were  much  injured.  The 
howls  and  yells  of  the  rioters  were  mingled 
with  the  cries  of  the  terrified  ladies.  One  or 
two  strange  incidents  occurred,  not  reflecting 
much  credit  on  the  gallantry  of  the  sterner  sex, 
one  of  whom,  having  escorted  a  lady  to  church, 
after  the  tumult  began,  climbed  into  a  safe  posi- 
tion, and  then,  looking  down  at  the  lady,  said — 
"  Can  you  get  up  here  ?"  "  No,"  was  the  ago- 
nising answer.  "  Well,  for  God's  sake,  take 
care  of  yourself,"  said  the  hero.  Mr.  Bu- 
chanan, the  emigrant  agent,  was  knocked  on 
his  back  in  the  dark,  and  cut  severely  about  the 
head.  He  called  out  his  name  and  asked  why 
he  was  struck,  when  his  countrymen,  who 
were  battering  him,  apologised  and  helped  him 
up. 


I/O  PASSAGES   IN 

"  They  met  with  a  friend, 
And  for  love  knocked  him  down." 

When  the  rioters  slackened  in  their  violence, 
the  police  made  a  show  of  interfering,  when  the 
cry  was  raised,  "  Send  for  the  troops."  Colonel 
Grubbe,  of  the  66th  Regiment,  the  command- 
ant of  the  garrison,  quickly  turned  out  a  party 
of  his  regiment,  and  of  the  Royal  Artillery, 
and  marching  them  to  the  scene  of  the  riot,  it 
immediately  ceased.  The  citizens  who  had  re- 
mained in  the  church  were  enabled  to  retreat  to 
their  homes,  and  Gavazzi  regained  Russell's 
Hotel. 

A  telegraphic  message  conveyed  the  above 
particulars  to  Montreal,  with  the  addition  that 
Gavazzi  was  about  to  visit  this,  the  largest 
city  in  Canada,  of  60,000  inhabitants.  Many 
of  these  were  accustomed  to  arms  since  the 
rebellion  of  1837-38,  when  the  loyal  people 
turned  out  most  gallantly  in  the  cause  of  the 
Queen,  and  subjecting  themselves  to  great 
hardships,  and  risk  of  loss  of  property,  health, 
and  life,  marched  and  fought  alongside  of  the 
regular  troops.  May  they  ever  remain  faithful 
to  the  old  flag  ! 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  171 

The  Montrealers  are  an  excitable  people, 
active-minded,  and  rapidly  advancing  in  pros- 
perity and  intelligence;  yet  still,  in  1853,  there 
was  a  strong  leaven  of  party  spirit  among  them, 
which  it  was  dangerous  to  rouse  into  action. 

From  having  seen  many  fights  in  the  streets 
of  Montreal  at  elections,  and  stones,  pistols, 
and  axe-handles  freely  used,  the  military  called 
out,  followed  by  pursuits  and  captures;  and 
having  also,  in  charge  of  troops,  assisted  to 
preserve  order,  I  knew  what  would  be  the 
result  of  the  injudicious  invitation  to  Gavazzi  to 
lecture  in  this  city.  What  had  just  occurred  at 
the  usually  peaceable  Quebec  ought  to  have  been 
a  sufficient  warning  of  what  would  be  likely  to 
happen  in  Montreal.  The  invitation  was  given 
"  to  maintain  a  principle" — freedom  of  speech 
for  Protestants  as  well  as  Roman  Catholics — 
the  recent  convert  from  Protestantism,  Brown- 
son,  having  been  allowed  to  lecture  against  his 
previous  form  of  religion  uninterruptedly ;  but 
the  result  of  the  Gavazzi  lecture  at  Montreal 
was  most  lamentable. 

Expecting  a  disturbance  from  the  moment  of 
Gavazzi's  arrival,  desirous  also  of  seeing  what 
might  occur,  and  wishing  to  be  of  service  in 


172  PASSAGES   IN 

preserving  peace  and  order;  on  the  9th  June, 
I  walked,  at  an  early  hour,  from  my  quarters  in 
Notre  Dame  Street,  to  the  steam-boat  landing. 
Gavazzi  had  been  accompanied  from  Quebec 
by  a  number  of  friends  carrying  concealed  arms. 
He  was  met  on  the  wharf  by  the  Rev.  Messrs. 
Jenkins  and  Campbell,  and  others,  and  was 
escorted  to  his  hotel  by  a  body  of  friends,  too 
numerous  for  the  would-be  rioters  to  encounter ; 
some  of  whom,  however,  well-known  hired 
combatants  at  elections,  were  lurking  about  and 
watching  the  chance  of  a  tumult. 

During  the  day,  Gavazzi  held  a  sort  of  levee 
at  the  St.  Lawrence  Hotel,  and  walked  the 
streets,  accompanied  by  a  Protestant  clergyman 
and  zealous  Orangeman,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Campbell. 

Hand-bills  announced  a  lecture  by  Gavazzi  at 
Zion  Church  (the  congregational)  in  the  even- 
ing, and  in  the  afternoon  I  went  to  reconnoitre 
the  ground  about  it,  to  consider  how  troops 
could  be  placed  to  the  best  advantage  in  case  of 
a  serious  riot. 

The  Haymarket,  where  Zion  Church  is 
situated,  is  a  large  open  space  at  the  west  end 
of  the  city.  There  are  houses  on  the  west  side 
of  the  market,  a  fence  enclosing  a  wood-yard  on 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  173 

the  east  side,  a  detached  weigh-house  at  the 
upper  end  of  the  market,  in  a  diagonal  line 
from  which  is  Zion  Church ;  opposite  are  some 
enclosed  gardens,  above  which  the  ground  rises 
towards  the  Unitarian  Chapel  and  Lagauchetiere 
Street.  Craig  Street  runs  across  the  bottom  of 
the  Haymarket,  and  south  of  it  there  is  another 
open  space  called  Commissioners'  Square,  with 
a  detached  fire-engine  house.  I  thought  that  if 
a  body  of  troops  were  placed  inside  the  garden- 
fence  opposite  Zion  Church,  and  ready  to  act  in 
a  moment  if  required,  there  could  be  no  serious 
riot.  A  different  plan  was  adopted. 

Some  of  the  respectable  merchants  and  store- 
keepers went  to  the  magistrates,  and  offered  to 
enrol  themselves  as  special  constables.  Un- 
fortunately the  mayor,  thinking  that  his  police 
could  maintain  order,  declined  the  offers  of 
service  tendered  to  him.  A  Protestant  wine- 
merchant,  whom  I  encountered,  told  me,  "  We 
will  be  prepared  in  the  church  to  meet  force 
with  force." 

The  relief  of  the  20th  Regiment,  which  had 
been  for  some  time  in  garrison  at  Montreal, 
happened  to  take  place  this  day,  the  26th 
Cameronians  taking  their  place.  This  was 


174  PASSAGES   IN 

another  misfortune;  for  the  20th  Regiment 
were  acquainted  with  the  character  of  the 
people  of  the  city,  whereas  the  new  regi- 
ment, just  landed  from  Gibraltar,  came  into 
a  strange  place,  of  the  inhabitants  of  which 
they  were  as  yet  quite  ignorant;  by  outward 
appearance,  irrespective  of  deeds,  they  could  not 
form  a  conjecture  who  were  peaceable  and  who 
were  riotously  disposed. 

At  six  in  the  evening,  I  rode  with  Lieut. 
General  Rowan,  commanding  H.  M.  Forces, 
to  see  the  head-quarters  of  the  20th  Regi- 
ment embark  in  the  steamer  for  Quebec, 
previous  to  sailing  for  England. 

After  the  troops  were  on  board,  and  the 
General  having  no  further  occasion  for  my  ser- 
vices at  the  time,  and  I  being  anxious  to  hear 
so  remarkable  a  character  as  Gavazzi,  I  went  in 
undress  uniform  to  Zion  Church,  buying  a  ticket 
at  a  book-store  on  the  way.  It  was  after  seven 
before  the  church  was  reached. 

I  met  with  no  obstruction,  though  I  thought 
it  not  improbable  I  might  do  so,  as  I  passed 
knots  of  rough-looking  men  in  the  Haymarket 
Square.  I  overheard  one  man  say  to  another, 
"  There  are  some  military  in  a  house  in  Craig 


THE   LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER,  1J5 

Street"  (about  500  yards  off).   The  mayor  had 
brought  them  there. 

In  front  of  Zion  Church,  I  saw  about  forty 
policemen  drawn  up,  armed  only  with  their  blue 
batons,  which  I  always  thought  were  quite  inade- 
quate to  deal  with  the  pistols  and  bludgeons 
carried  by  the  disturbers  of  the  peace.  On  the 
right  of  the  church,  in  a  narrow  street,  two  po- 
licemen were  keeping  the  ground,  where  I  saw  a 
door  leading  into  the  basement,  a  convenient 
sally-port  if  necessary. 

On  entering  the  church,  I  found  the  heat  very 
great ;  the  afternoon  was  close  and  sultry,  indi- 
cating thunder.  The  interior  was  filled  with 
respectable-looking  men,  with  a  few  ladies  in 
the  gallery.  The  windows  on  the  left  of  the 
pulpit  were  boarded  up  for  fear  of  stones  coming 
through  them,  as  had  happened  at  Quebec. 

I  was  invited  to  take  a  seat  at  the  far  end, 
below  and  near  the  platform ;  but,  anticipating  a 
disturbance  and  the  calling  out  of  the  troops,  I 
declined  to  sit  down,  and  remained  standing  at 
the  right  of  the  cross  passage,  near  the  door  of 
entrance.  There  I  could  see  and  hear  perfectly 
well,  and  felt  myself  comparatively  at  liberty  to 
act  as  the  occasion  might  require. 


176  PASSAGES    IN 

This  hand-bill  I  had  just  seen  in  the  streets, 
but  I  did  not  think  that  the  Irish  Roman 
Catholics  would  pay  much  attention  to  it,  though 
the  Canadian  Roman  Catholics  took  no  part  in 
the  subsequent  riot : — 

"CATHOLICS  OF  MONTREAL!  ! 

Keep  the  peace,  and  let  Gavazzi  say  what  he 
will ;  do  not  disgrace  yourselves  by  creating  a 
disturbance  for  the  sake  of  a  worthless  fellow ; 
keep  quiet,  and  take  no  notice  of  what  he  says. 
Your  Protestant  fellow-citizens  will  be  ashamed 
of  their  renegade  friar  yet. 

"  By  order  of  the  Catholic  Institute., 

(Signed)          "  S.  O'GRADY,  Secretary. 

"  Montreal,  June  9,  1853." 

Father  Gavazzi  was  addressing  the  audience 
in  Zion  Church  from  the  front  of  a  temporary 
platform.  On  three  sides,  behind  him,  were 
seated  about  a  dozen  and  a-half  of  gentlemen, 
among  whom  were  some  clergymen.  Gavazzi 
was  conspicuous  by  his  commanding  figure,  long 
hair,  and  black  gown,  with  large  crosses  on  the 
breast  and  left  shoulder,  as  he  is  usually  seen  in 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  177 

pictures.  He  spoke  in  English,  and  it  was 
not  easy  to  follow  him  at  first.  He  was 
discursive,  and  his  accent  was  of  course  peculiar. 
He  was  calm,  and  energetic,  and  violent  by 
turns. 

He  talked  of  the  errors  of  Popery,  of  the  danger 
of  Protestant  parents  sending  their  boys  to 
Roman  Catholic  schools  and  colleges,  and  their 
girls  to  nunneries,  for  education ;  recommended 
Protestants  on  no  account  to  allow  their  precious 
Bibles  to  be  banished  from  their  seminaries; 
said  he  could  hardly  believe  that  this  was  a  land 
enjoying  freedom  under  British  rule,  since, 
though  Brownson  (before  mentioned)  had  been 
allowed  to  lecture  violently,  and  several  times, 
against  that  Protestantism  he  once  professed, 
yet  he  (Gavazzi)  had  been  attacked  with  sticks 
and  stones  at  Quebec.  He  "  suited  the  action 
to  the  word,"  threw  about  his  arms,  and  clenched 
his  fists,  occasionally  flinging  the  loose  folds  of 
his  gown  over  one  shoulder,  whilst  his  hair  at 
times  streamed  over  his  face. 

The  whole  scene  and  appearance  of  the  lec- 
turer must  have  been  startling  to  those  with 
weak  nerves,  and  there  was  a  lurid  glare  of 
light  shed  through  the  southern  windows  of  the 

VOL.    I.  N 


178  PASSAGES    IN 

church.  I  strongly  felt  that  "  coming  events  " 
do  sometimes,  indeed,  "  cast  their  shadows  be- 
fore them." 

The  audience  maintained  a  deep  silence  for  a 
time  ;  but  I  thought,  that  if  I  had  been  a 
Roman  Catholic,  and  heard  Gavazzi's  powerful 
denunciations  against  my  creed,  I  must  have 
been  greatly  stirred  and  moved  against  him,  and 
that  his  manner  of  lecturing  amongst,  possibly,  a 
mixed  audience,  was  dangerous  in  the  extreme. 
I  also  wondered  at  the  boldness  of  the  man,  and 
how  little  he  seemed  to  regard  his  own  life,  or 
the  peril  he  then  was  in,  and  of  the  dangers  he 
had  already  so  frequently  passed;  indeed,  "a 
baptism  of  blood." 

By  and  by,  as  he  went  on,  there  were  encour- 
aging cheers  from  the  audience,  and  some  de- 
risive ones  also  near  me  ;  and  a  person  whispered 
to  me  that  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  Irish  Roman 
Catholics  was  in  the  church.  Gavazzi  now  went 
on  to  give  a  ludicrous  imitation  of  the  apparently 
meek  and  gentle  demeanour  of  a  Romish  priest, 
whilst  speaking  of  Gavazzi,  of  his  errors,  his 
delusions,  and  clasped  his  hands,  and  whined 
as  if  pitying.  It  has  been  truly  said,  "  C'est  la 
ridicule  qui  tue ;"  and  the  leader  above  men- 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  179 

tioned  now  got  up  and  left  the  church,  just  as 
the  gas  was  lighted. 

Immediately  cheering  and  shouts  were  heard 
outside,  and  those  inside  becoming  excited, 
Gavazzi  ceased  speaking.  Some  got  over  the 
backs  of  the  seats.  I  asked  what  was  the 
matter,  and  was  answered  that  there  was  a  fight 
outside  with  the  police.  A  party  of  men  from 
the  audience  now  rushed  past  me,  and  dis- 
appeared below  by  a  side  door.  I  thought  they 
were  escaping  by  the  basement,  but  they  pre- 
sently reappeared  armed,  some  twenty  or  thirty 
of  them,  with  fowling-pieces.  They  went  out- 
side. There  was  some  more  noise,  but  the 
tumult  soon  subsided,  and  the  armed  party  re- 
turned inside.  The  gentleman  (Mr.  W.  Ly man) 
in  the  chair  behind  Gavazzi,  now  came  forward 
and  assured  the  audience  that  all  would  be  well, 
and  the  orator  continued  his  address ;  but  again 
there  was  a  disturbance  outside,  the  church  was 
attacked  by  a  mob,  and  a  man  was  brought  in 
wounded  in  the  head. 

I  thought  it  now  time  to  see  what  the  troops 
were  doing,  and  left  the  church,  in  which  the 
only  officer  I  saw  was  Captain  Crespigny,  20th 
Regiment ;  also  two  artillerymen  near  me.  I 

N  2 


180  PASSAGES   IN 

directed  the  latter  to  come  out.  I  saw  the  front 
of  the  church  clear  of  the  police :  they  had  been 
attacked  by  the  mob  and  beaten  off  the  field. 
The  two  chiefs  of  police,  the  brothers  Ermatinger, 
though  fighting  manfully,  had  been  overpowered, 
and  severely  cut  in  the  head.  The  rioters  had  tried 
to  storm  the  church,  but  were  repelled ;  shots 
were  exchanged,  two  or  three  men  were  knocked 
over,  the  rioters  fled,  and  were  pursued  towards 
Craig-street  by  some  of  the  church  party.  The 
rioters  then  drew  up  in  a  dark  mass  near  the 
engine-house  in  Commissioners'  Square,  and 
their  opponents  shouted  at  them,  waved  their 
hats  and  guns  at  them,  and  defied  them  from 
the  corner  of  the  Weigh-house  of  the  Hay- 
market.  It  was  an  exciting  scene. 

The  charging  party  passed  me  on  their  way 
back  to  the  church,  and  I  now  saw  below,  the 
military,  100  rank  and  file  of  the  26th  Regiment, 
under  the  command  of  Bt.  Lieut.-Colonel  Ho- 
garth, C.B.  (now  no  more),  march  along  Craig- 
street,  and  draw  up  in  a  line  facing  the  rioters, 
as  if  to  separate  them  from  the  church  party, 
or  to  enable  the  discomfited  police  to  rally.  I 
went  towards  the  troops,  and  asking,  on  my  way, 
if  any  of  the  people  who  had  been  hurt  were 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  181 

near,  I  was  directed  to  the  Weigh-house,  where 
I  found  a  man  in  a  coarse  shirt  and  trousers, 
lying  on  his  side,  and  in  great  distress  from  a 
gun-shot  wound  through  his  ribs.  "  It  was 
just  a  poor  boy*  coming  from  his  work,"  said  a 
man  beside  me,  "  and  he's  used  in  that  way !" 
But  he  had  been  engaged  in  the  melee.  As 
Dr.  Macdonald  lived  across  the  way,  J  got  two 
men  to  assist  to  carry  him,  and  I  left  him  to  the 
care  of  the  Doctor,  who  had  his  hands  full 
before  the  night  was  over. 

I  found  the  mayor,  the  Hon.  Charles  Wilson, 
and  the  town-major,  McDonald,  with  the  troops. 
The  mayor  said  that  the  police  had  been  beaten, 
and  I  understood  that  he  also  had  been  struck. 
There  seemed  to  be  a  difference  of  opinion  be- 
tween the  mayor  and  the  town-major  about  the 
disposition  of  the  troops ;  Colonel  Hogarth,  who 
was  a  stranger  to  the  place,  was  desirous  to  get 
distinct  directions  what  he  was  expected  to  do 
with  his  men,  and  he  said  he  would  immediately 
do  it.  The  line  was  then  faced  about,  and 
marched  a  little  higher  up  the  Haymarket,  then 
divided ;  one-half  under  Lieutenant  Quartley 
halted  and  faced  about  towards  the  rioters,  the 

*  Donelly  by  name.

other  fifty  men,  under  Captain  Cameron,  with 
whom  was  Lieutenant  Chute,  moved  on  obliquely, 
were  halted  and  countermarched  at  fifty  yards 
from  the  other  party  of  the  26th  Regiment ;  they 
thus  faced  outward,  one  flank  of  each  sub-division 
resting  on  the  side  walk  on  the  west  side  of  the 
Haymarket,  the  other  flank  being  en  Vair. 

I  now  took  the  liberty  of  suggesting  to  the 
mayor,  with  whom  I  was  well  acquainted,  the 
expediency  of  marching  part  of  the  soldiers  past 
the  front  of  the  church,  and  occupying  the  hill- 
above,  the  rest  of  the  troops  remaining  below 
(whilst  the  bulk  of  the  audience  in  Zion  Church, 
and  Gavazzi  himself,  who  was  still  inside,  could 
retire) ;  but  the  movement  I  proposed  was  not 
thought  necessary ;  so,  taking  up  a  position  OB 
the  side  walk  in  front  (but  clear)  of  the  sub- 
division facing  the  hill,  I  waited  to  see  the 
people  come  out]  of  church ;  the  police  in  the 
mean  time  drew  up  again  south  of  the  Weigh- 
house. 

Some  of  the  rioters  had  got  round  by  the 
back  of  the  church,  there  being  too  few  police 
to  observe  them,  and  I  saw  a  scuffle  take  place 
in  front  of  the  church ;  the  people  about  me, 
among  whom  were  some  females  on  the  side 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  183 

walk,  seemed  much  excited.  Colonel  Hogarth 
was  in  the  clear  space  between  the  two  sub- 
divisions of  his  party,  the  mayor  was  moving 
towards  the  lower  party  from  the  police.  I  now 
saw  some  shots  fired  from  the  rioters  near  the 
engine-house,  apparently  in  the  direction  of  the 
troops ;  and  I  understood  afterwards  that  the 
balls  whistled  past  their  ears  ;  many  of  the  party 
knew  the  sound  of  balls,  as  they  wore  Chinese 
medals ;  there  was  also  much  shouting,  and  a 
rush  towards  the  troops. 

The  soldiers  had  loaded  by  desire  of  the 
mayor  previous  to  coming  on  the  ground.  The 
mayor  now,  hurriedly,  read  the  Riot  Act,  which 
is  very  short.  1  was  too  distant  to  hear  it,  and 
I  understood  that  some  one  called  out,  it  was 
alleged  to  have  been  the  mayor,  "  Fire  I  Fire ! 
Fire  1"  which  was  done,  first  by  the  lower  party 
as  if  rapidly  file-firing,  shots  were  fired  from  the 
hill  towards  where  I  stood,  and  this  seemed  to 
draw  the  fire  of  the  soldiers  facing  the  hill — 
there  was  a  round  from  each  sub-division;  I 
heard  no  word  of  command  from  any  of  the 
officers,  and  whilst  I  drew  back  towards  the 
houses  out  of  the  line  of  fire,  and  pushed  the 
people  near  me  back  also,  and  into  a  doorway, 


184  PASSAGES    IN 

the  bugle  sounded  loudly  "  cease  firing."  The 
whole  was  the  work  of  half  a  minute. 

Some  of  those  about  me  laughed,  and  thought 
that  the  troops  had  fired  blank  cartridge :  but 
they  were  undeceived  when  some  people  were 
seen  lying  towards  the  top  of  the  hill,  yet  the 
troops  fired  high,  and,  I  am  sure,  discharged 
their  pieces  merely  to  obey  what  they  thought, 
amidst  the  noise  and  confusion,  was  an  order, 
and  without  any  other  feeling,  having  just 
arrived  in  Montreal.  There  were  bullet  marks 
very  high  up  on  the  pillars  of  the  Unitarian 
Chapel  at  the  top  of  the  hill,  and  a  Mr.  Drum- 
mond,  who  was  in  his  house  in  the  Hay  market, 
near  which  house  one  of  the  sub-divisions  stood, 
told  me  that  he  remarked  that  the  soldiers 
generally  elevated  their  pieces,  and  fired  at  an 
angle  of  45°,  in  proof  of  which,  next  morning, 
he  drew  my  attention  (when  I  was  occupied 
sketching  the  ground  for  General  Rowan)  to 
several  large  bullet  marks  high  up  on  a  brick 
wall  at  a  blacksmith's  shop  in  Commissioner's 
Square.  Mr.  Dawson  a  bookseller,  also  told  me 
that  he  saw  the  troops  fire  high,  and  he  thought 
they  were  merely  "  emptying  their  pieces." 

It  was  now  eight  o'clock  and  dusk,  and  the 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  185 

spirit  of  evil  seemed  to  be  moving  about  among 
the  crowd,  and  the  groups  of  agitated  people. 
Colonel  Ermatinger,  the  police  magistrate,  and 
Captain  Ermatinger,  chief  of  police,  were  bleed- 
ing profusely  from  their  temples,  their  men  had 
been  scattered  with  large  stones  chiefly,  after 
resisting,  in  the  first  instance,  the  rioters  ad- 
vancing to  the  steps  of  the  church.  There  was 
still  skirmishing  going  on  at  the  outskirts  of  the 
mob,  towards  McGill  Street,  the  rioters  attack- 
ing at  close  quarters  those  going  home ;  more 
than  two-thirds  of  the  casualties — and  there 
were  perhaps  fifty  in  all,  killed  and  wounded — 
took  place  from  pistol  bullets  and  knives,  and  not 
from  the  large  military  bullets.  Persons  from  ten 
years  of  age  to  sixty  suffered,  including  gentle- 
men and  workpeople,  with  English,  Scotch,  and 
Irish  names,*  two  ladies  were  wounded,  and 
some  good  people,  though  apparently  not  dan- 
gerously wounded  at  the  time,  died  afterwards 
with  much  suffering.

barkation  of  the  20th  Regiment,  now  came  on 
the  ground  mounted,  and  gave  directions  that 
a  party  of  soldiers  should  go  to  the  church  and 
escort  Gavazzi  and  his  friends  in  safety  to  his 
hotel  in  Great  St.  Jarnes  Street.  They  were 
followed  by  a  mob,  and  a  reinforcement  of  100 
men  having  arrived  under  Captain  Carey,  the  Co- 
lonel patrolled  with  part  of  the  troops  along 
Great  St.  James  Street  and  down  McGill 
Street.  The  town-major  and  myself  accom- 
panied this  patrol,  and  we  saw  that  the  rioters 
immediately  dispersed  on  the  approach  of  the 
soldiers.  I  do  not  see  how  a  considerable  body 
of  troops,  of  some  kind,  can  ever  be  dispensed 
with  at  Montreal,  being  required,  among  other 
reasons,  to  keep  in  check  the  workmen  engaged 
in  the  numerous  public  works  there. 

There  was  a  very  angry  feeling  displayed 
towards  the  mayor,  and  not  towards  the  soldiers, 
at  the  time,  by  those  who  had  narrowly  escaped 
from  the  fire  as  they  came  out  of  church,  or 
whose  friends  had  suffered.  Several  gentlemen 
crowded  round  his  Worship,  shaking  their 
clenched  fists  in  his  face,  and  denouncing  him 
as  a  murderer  for  ordering  the  troops  to  fire, 
and  declaring  that  he  himself  should  be  mur- 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  187 

dered  on  the  spot.  I  thought  his  life  was  in 
danger,  and  as  he  had  no  escort  of  police  or  any 
magistrate  near  him,  I  took  him  by  the  arm, 
and  put  him  among  the  soldiers,  and  advised 
him  on  no  account  to  let  a  crowd  close  on 
him.  He  was  so  occupied  with  the  responsi- 
bilities of  his  situation,  that  he  seemed  to  me  to 
be  regardless  of  his  personal  safety,  and  he  had 
done  very  good  service  on  previous  occasions 
of  disturbance. 

General  Rowan,  to  whom  I  was  on  the  eve 
of  going  to  report  and  to  ask  his  orders,  having 
heard  the  firing  from  his  house  in  Sherbrooke 
Street,  now  came  on  the  ground  on  horseback, 
also  Major  Rowan,  Military  Secretary,  Captain 
the  Hon.  F.  Keane,  R.E.,  and  Lieutenants 
Noble  and  Lambert,  R.E.  A  party  of  troops 
and  of  police  were  stationed  at  the  weigh-house 
to  prevent  Zion  Chuch  being  set  on  fire  during 
the  night,  another  party,  with  an  officer,  was 
placed  in  the  hotel,  Great  St.  James,  where 
Gavazzi  was,  and  an  officer's  party  also  protected 
the  mayor's  house.  The  artillery,  under  Captain 
Rotton,  patrolled  the  streets  as  a  troop  of 
cavalry,  and  the  remainder  of  the  night  was 


188  PASSAGES    IN 

passed  in  quiet,  except  by  those  who  mourned 
the  loss  or  attended  to  the  wounds  of  friends. 

Though  some  insisted  that  Gavazzi  should 
lecture  again,  strongly  guarded,  yet  it  was 
eventually  more  wisely  decided  that  he  had 
better  leave  the  city ;  and  he  did  so,  and  I 
afterwards  heard  him  lecture  in  Italian  in  New 
York. 

Great  excitement  prevailed  in  Montreal  after 
the  disastrous  proceedings  of  the  9th  June.  A 
public  meeting  was  held  to  investigate  the 
causes  of  the  riot,  and  to  concert  measures  to 
maintain  the  peace  of  the  city.  A  proclamation 
was  issued,  enjoining  all  peaceably  inclined 
citizens  to  refrain  from  going  abroad  unneces- 
sarily after  sun-down ;  several  people  were 
knocked  down,  abused,  and  fired  at;  among 
others,  Mr.  Augustus  Reward,  a  bold  and 
active  man  of  the  church  party,  had  some 
narrow  escapes. 

A  coroner's  inquest  was  held,  and  continued 
its  sittings  for  a  month.  The  inquest  was  most 
impartially  conducted  under  the  direction  of 
Messrs.  Jones  and  Coursolle,  the  joint  coroners 
for  the  city.  There  was  much  conflicting 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  189 

evidence  among  the  military.  Some  of  the 
soldiers  maintained  that  they  had  got  a  military 
word  of  command  to  fire.  They  may  have 
thought  so ;  but  I  am  certain  that  they  did  not 
get  the  words,  "  Ready,  present !"  from  an 
officer. 

A  remarkable  evidence  appeared  in  the 
person  of  a  Scotchwoman,  Mrs.  Parker,  who 
had  been  a  teacher  in  Upper  Canada,  and  had 
lately  been  employed  in  a  store  in  Montreal. 
She  was  in  the  crowd  at  the  Haymarket,  at  one 
side,  and  between  the  two  subdivisions  of  the 
military;  and  she  said  that  a  man  came  from 
the  left  of  the  lower  subdivision,  and  when  the 
words,  "  fire !  fire !"  were  given  by  some  one, 
there  was  a  little  delay,  when  the  man,  who 
looked  like  an  Irish  labourer,  placing  his  straw 
hat  under  his  left  arm,  and  putting  his  hand  to 
his  mouth,  gave  the  military  command,  in 
military  style,  "  Ready,  present !"  The  lower 
subdivision  then  fired,  and  he  said,  smiling, 
"It's  nineteen  years  since  I  took  the  lousy 
shilling  (enlisted),  but  all  that  time  I  had  not 
the  satisfaction  I  have  this  night."  Mrs. 
Parker  lost  sight  of  him  for  some  time,  but 
saw  him  again  with  two  or  three  others,  ap- 


190  PASSAGES   IN 

parently  his  comrades.  She  taxed  him  with 
being  the  cause  of  the  troops  firing,  and  the 
loss  of  life,  when  one  of  the  men  said,  "  It  was 
not  him  gave  the  word ;  it  was  the  Holy 
Virgin !" 

If  Mrs.  Parker's  evidence  was  correct,  it  clears 
up  a  great  mystery.  I  saw  her  two  or  three 
times  afterwards,  when  she  was  exposed  to  risk, 
and  even  wounded  with  a  pistol-bullet,  for  her 
evidence,  and  I  had  no  reason  to  doubt  her 
veracity. 

A  court  of  inquiry  was  assembled,  by  the 
direction  of  the  Lieut.  General  Command- 
ing, on  the  conduct  of  the  military  on  the  9th 
of  June.  The  firing  of  the  troops  may  be 
accounted  for,  as  far  as  I  could  explain  the 
matter  from  what  I  observed,  in  the  following 
manner. 

The  police  had  fought  as  well  as  they  could 
in  front  of  Zion  Church.  They  were  few  in 
number  compared  with  the  mob  opposed  to 
them,  and  they  were  very  inadequately  armed 
with  their  blue  sticks  only.  The  mob  had 
sticks,  stones,  and  pistols.  The  chiefs  of  the 
police  were  severely  wounded;  they  fought 
bravely,  and  did  all  they  could  against  such 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  191 

odds.  The  mayor,  as  is  well  known,  had  on 
former  occasions  done  very  good  service,  and 
had  shown  a  great  deal  of  zeal  and  activity. 
This  ought  not  to  have  been  forgotten  on  the 
present  occasion.  Seeing  what  had  happened  to 
the  police,  and  to  quell  further  riot,  the  mayor  ran 
off  for  the  military,  100  rank  and  file,  who 
were  posted  (I  think)  much  too  far  from  the 
scene  of  action,  at  a  fire-engine  house  nearly  a 
quarter  of  a  mile  from  Zion  Church. 

The  military  were  hurriedly  called  out  of  the 
engine-house  (next  to  the  police  station,  Craig- 
street),  and  were  directed  by  the  Mayor  to  load, 
to  quell  a  serious  riot,  and  save  the  police. 
The  police  magistrate  came  up  wounded  and 
bleeding,  and  called  out,  "  The  troops !  the 
troops !"  The  soldiers  saw  and  heard  this. 
The  troops  were  marched  rapidly  to  the 
Haymarket,  ready  loaded.  This  was  unfortu- 
nate. The  act  of  loading  before  a  mob  has  a 
useful  effect.  Few  of  the  people  at  the 
Haymarket  knew  that  the  soldiers  were  loaded ; 
I  did  not  know  they  were  loaded  when  I  joined 
them. 

From  what  the  soldiers  saw  and  heard  as 
they  came  on  the  ground,  and  from  the  confu- 


192  PASSAGES    IN 

sion  near  them,  they  were  probably  somewhat 
excited,  and  some  of  them  may  have  thought 
that  this  was  to  be  a  "  Six-mile  Bridge  "  affair 
(when  the  troops  were  attacked  by  the  mob)  ; 
also  when  fire-arms  were  used  in  front  of  both 
parties  of  the  soldiers,  and  it  is  given  in  evi- 
dence that  some  pistol  balls  passed  among  the 
soldiers.  The  word  was  given  by  some  one 
(not  by  an  officer)  to  fire.  The  soldiers  thought 
they  should  fire,  and  they  did  so  (probably 
thinking  a  magistrate  gave  the  order),  first 
the  lower  division  and  then  the  upper  divi- 
sion. 

The  26th  Regiment  has  a  high  character  in 
the  army  for  steadiness.  A  very  handsome 
general  order  was  issued  when  the  regiment  left 
Gibraltar  for  Canada  in  May,  1853.  Many 
of  the  old  soldiers  wore  medals  for  the  China 
war ;  the  others  were  a  fine  set  of  young  men, 
who  may  never  have  seen  a  riot  before.  The 
regiment  had  been  only  thirty- six  hours  in  Mon- 
treal when  this  unfortunate  "  Gavazzi  riot " 
occurred.  The  men  knew  neither  Catholics 
nor  Protestants  on  the  ground.  One-third  of 
the  men  were  Roman  Catholics,  two-thirds 
were  Protestants ;  the  senior  officers  who 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  193 

commanded  at  the  Haymarket  were  Presbyte- 
rians. 

The  men  fired  from  misapprehension — it  was 
a  mistake ;  and  I  am  sure  they  regretted  ex- 
tremely, as  we  all  did,  the  innocent  people  who 
fell  by  that  fire.  There  was  much  to  be  said 
in  excuse  for  the  men. 

One  thing  was  important,  as  far  as  the 
military  were  concerned,  and  which  seemed  to 
have  been  forgotten,  This  I  remarked  during 
the  riots  in  1849,  when  the  Houses  of  Parlia- 
ment were  burned.  They  would  not  have 
been  burned  if  the  military  had  been  called  out 
a  little  sooner  then.  At  that  time,  300  horse- 
pistols,  and  the  same  number  of  cutlasses,  were 
issued  from  the  ordnance  stores,  to  arm  a  civic 
force.  Very  few  of  these  arms  were  returned  ; 
180  pistols  were  still  in  the  hands  of  the 
people.  They  carried  a  large  ball ;  about  as  large 
as  a  musket-ball.  One  of  these  was  in  court 
to  compare  with  a  musket-ball.  I  believe  that 
several  of  the  wounds  by  large  balls,  inflicted 
on  the  evening  of  the  9th  June,  did  not  proceed 
from  military  muskets. 

Finally,  I  believe  that  many  of  the  soldiers 

VOL.    I.  O 


194  PASSAGES   IN 

fired  high  on  purpose,  else  the  loss  of  life  would 
have  been  much  greater.  It  was  unfortunate 
that  one  division  fired  against  a  hill.  As  I  said 
before,  if  the  troops  had  not  been  on  the 
ground  at  all,  from  what  I  saw  of  the  angry 
feelings  of  the  contending  parties,  at  least  100 
lives,  instead  of  twelve,  must  have  been  lost  in 
and  about  Zion  Church.  Until  there  is  less 
rancorous  feeling  and  party  spirit  abroad,  we 
cannot  dispense  with  armed  men. 

There  were  three  consecutive  years  of  disaster 
in  Montreal.  In  1852,  terrible  fires  swept 
across  the  city.  In  1853  was  the  Gavazzi 
tragedy  just  described,  and  in  1854,  a  fearful 
visitation  of  cholera.  Fourteen  hundred  citi- 
zens and  emigrants  perished  in  July  and  August. 
May  we  hope,  that  with  the  radiation  of  rail- 
roads from  Montreal,  the  success  of  the  numerous 
factories  rising  in  the  suburbs,  the  appearance  of 
the  flags  of  all  nations  on  the  waters  of  the  St. 
Lawrence — and  among  them  ever  pre-eminent 
the  red-cross  flag  of  Britain — the  triumphant 
completion  of  one  of  the  world's  wonders,  the 
Victoria  tubular  bridge,  the  subsidence  of  party 
spirit,  and  the  spread  of  charity  and  brotherly

Island  Pond,  we  reached  the  fine  group  of 
the  White  Mountains  5  and  6,000  feet  high.  I 
ascended  one  of  them,  and  was  highly  pleased 
with  the  wild  forest  scenery,  and  the  panorama 
of  mountains  around,  the  view  extending  east- 
ward as  far  as  the  broad  Atlantic. 

At  the  beautiful  River  Androscoggin  below 
the  mountains,  there  is  good  fishing  ground, 
and  the  journey  down  the  Connecticut  River  is 
through  a  pleasant  and  fertile  country.  Port- 
land is  a  clean-looking,  cheerful  place,  with 
plenty  of  trees  shading  the  streets,  a  fine  bay 
and  a  rising  trade.  I  had  the  pleasure  of 
making  the  acquaintance  of  the  family  of  the 
President  of  the  St.  Lawrence  and  Atlantic 
railroad  there,  the  Hon.  Josiah  Little.  A  gen- 
tleman who  kindly  piloted  me  in  Portland,  was 
Mr.  J.  Dublois,  whom  I  met  at  Miss  Jones' 
boarding-house,  one  of  the  cleanest  and  best 
I  was  ever  in,  and  with  some  very  agreeable 
ladies  and  gentlemen  to  converse  with.  Mr.  J. 
Brown,  one  of  the  most  enterprising  of  the 
merchants,  showed  me  his  extensive  works  for 
converting  molasses,  which  he  imports  in  large 
quantities,  into  a  capital  brown  sugar,  which  is 
extensively  used  in  the  States.

At  the  Portland  Foundery,  I  was  pleased  to 
see  the  behaviour  of  the  men  at  noon ;  instead 
of  going  with  dirty  hands  and  faces  to  their 
meal  at  that  hour,  they  all  washed  and  put 
themselves  to  rights,  ("slicked  up"  is  the 
phrase)  for  dining.  They  begin  work  at  seven, 
after  their  breakfast,  have  an  hour  for  their 
mid- day  meal,  and  work  ten  hours  altogether, 
and  well  too.  American  superintendents  and 
contractors  are  not  to  be  trifled  with.  Some 
don't  allow  a  pipe  to  be  lighted,  or  a  word 
spoken  during  working  hours.  This  is  hard 
on  "Paddy"  at  first,  who  likes  to  take  a 
"shough  of  the  dudeen,"  and  to  "  discoorse,'* 
resting  on  the  top  of  his  spade. 

The  common  workmen  got  three  quarters  of 
a  dollar  per  day  at  the  Foundery,  the  next  class 
one  dollar,  mechanics  one  dollar  and  three  quar- 
ters, or  seven  shillings  British — more  than  the 
pay  of  British  lieutenants  of  the  line. 

At  Cape  Cottage,  on  the  sea  shore,  a  short 
distance  from  town,  there  was  a  good  bay  for 
bathing,  a  grove  of  trees  behind  for  a  noontide 
walk,  and  the  Atlantic  dashed  incessantly  in 
great  white  waves  over  a  group  of  rocks  before 
the  windows.  It  was  altogether  a  place  where, 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  199 

as  the  American  phrase  is,  "  one  could  have  a 
good  time." 

At  Portland  is  the  head-quarters  of  the 
Maine  Liquor  Law  party,  and  I  can  testify  to 
the  quiet  and  order  which  was  preserved  in  the 
streets  at  all  hours,  helped,  also,  no  doubt,  by 
lending  libraries,  an  excellent  museum  of  natu- 
ral curiosities,  a  well-regulated  post  office,  at 
which  letters  could  be  written  if  required,  and  a 
town  band,  paid  out  of  the  taxes,  which  also 
assisted  to  keep  the  people  quiet  and  amused, 
and  tended  to  inspire  them  with  self-respect. 

Between  thirty  and  forty  ships  were  built 
about  this  time  annually  in  Portland,  and  its 
exports  were  fish,  lumber,  ice,  &amp;c.  Its  inhabi- 
tants numbered  about  24,000.  The  people 
looked  healthy  generally,  and  the  ladies  were 
"  fair  to  behold,"  facts  attributable  to  the  good 
climate,  the  long  rocky  promontory  on  which  the 
city  is  built,  being  swept  by  the  pure  breezes  of 
the  ocean.  The  deep  bay  here  never  freezes,  like 
that  of  its  rival  Boston. 

I  much  admired  the  islands  which  stud  the 
bay,  for  they  seemed  to  promise  "  no  end" 
of  pleasure,  in  the  way  of  pic-nics  and  fishing

expeditions.  Altogether,  I  consider  Portland 
quite  a  model  town,  and  I  am  happy  that  the  State 
of  Maine,  with  its  fine  people,  "  away  down  East," 
are  now  in  a  manner  "  hooked  on"  to  Canada  by 
means  of  the  St.  Lawrence  and  Atlantic  rail. 

As  we  know  more  of  the  citizens  of  the 
Union,  and  they  of  us,  I  hope  and  trust  that 
Christian  charity  will  mutually  abound,  igno- 
rance is  the  parent  of  ill-will  and  jealousy. 

An  old  Yankee,  at  the  late  Boston  jubilee, 
had  a  curious  opinion  of  Canadians,  many  of 
whom  were  invited  there,  and  he  remarked  to 
an  acquaintance, 

"  Wall,  Sir,  there  be  a  considerable  of  Cana- 
dians to  Bosting  neow.  I  never  seed  much  of 
them  Canadians,  be'nt  they  raither  an  Indiany 
kind  of  folk?" 

I  journeyed  back  towards  Canada  with  a 
pleasant  party.  At  the  hotel,  at  the  foot  of 
Mount  Moriah,  I  spent  Sunday,  when  Bishop 
Lee,  assembling  a  congregation  in  the  public 
room,  and  taking  as  his  text  one  of  the  verses 
of  scripture  inscribed  on  the  tombs  at  Cape 
Riley,  over  three  of  Franklin's  sailors,  "  Consider 
your  ways,"  drew  such  an  affecting  picture  of 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  201 

what  must  have  been  the  sufferings  of  the  brave 
and  devoted  Arctic  leader  and  his  people,  that 
1  saw  now  clearly  the  excellent  feeling  which 
had  suggested  the  Grinnell  searching  expedition, 
under  the  intrepid  Dr.  Kane  from  the  port  of 
New  York,  so  very  creditable  to  our  transatlantic 
brethren,  and  now  followed  by  the  restoration 
of  the  abandoned  "  Resolute,"  to  the  British 
Government. 

I  visited  Ellis  Falls  among  the  mountains,  and 
put  up  at  an  excellent  hotel  for  excursionists, 
desirous  of  ascending  the  6800  feet  of  Mount 
Washington  opposite.  In  the  dining  saloon 
there  was  this  characteristic  notice  : 

"  Glen  House,  White  Mountains,  20th  June, 
1853.  RULES  FOR  THE  GLEN  HOUSE  DINING- 
ROOM,  to  be  obeyed  by  particular  request  of  the 
proprietor  of  this  house,  by  the  servants  in  the

be  no  remarks  made  upon  people  sitting  at  the

J.  M.  THOMPSON, 
Proprietor  of  the  Glen  House, 

ISAAC  KENDALL, 
Head-Waiter." 

Said  head-waiter,  by  the  way,  was  a  smart 
coloured  man,  and  he  kept  good  order  among 
his  white  and  dark  assistants,  and  placed 
abundant  and  wholesome  fare  on  the  long 
tables. 

There  is  some  sport  to  be  met  with  on  the 
White  Mountains ;  what  I  did  in  this  way  was 
to  catch  a  porcupine  with  my  plaid,  but  like 
the  man  who  won  the  elephant  in  the  raffle,  I 
did  not  know  what  to  do  with  it.  In  Africa,  it 
would  soon  have  gone  into  the  pot,  but  here 
after  it  had  parted  with  several  score  quills  in 
my  garment,  I  let  the  poor  creature  go,  not 
agreeing  with  the  wish  of  the  guide  to  "  kill 
the  porcumpine  with  a  club." 

Invited,  at  the  end  of  1853,  to  attend  as  a 
juror  from  Canada,  on  the  arms,  &amp;c.,  of 
Class  8  in  the  New  York  Crystal  Palace,  I 
journeyed  thither  with  Major  Rowan,  R.A. 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  203 

Military  Secretary,  and  "  we  had  a  good 
time." 

The  Crystal  Palace  was  a  very  creditable 
undertaking  for  those  who  originated  it,  and 
though  it  did  not  turn  out  a  profitable  specula- 
tion, it  caused  to  be  collected  and  exhibited  in 
a  vast  structure  of  glass  and  iron,  works  of  art 
of  great  interest,  useful  machines,  the  most 
improved  implements  of  husbandry,  valuable 
articles  of  porcelaine,  glass  and  jewellery,  cotton 
goods  and  broad  cloth,  cutlery,  ships'  iron  boats 
and  life  boats,  cannon  and  mortars,  pictures  and 
statues,  arms  of  all  kinds,  some  of  which  were 
lent  from  the  Tower  of  London,  revolvers  two 
hundred  years  old,  &amp;c. 

My  fellow  jurors  in  the  section  of  arms, 
&amp;c.,  were  Colonel  Page,  Colonel  Hazard,  Major 
Mordecai,  U.S.A.,  Captain  Cullum,  U.S.A., 
Mr.  E.  K.  Collins,  Mr.  Bell,  &amp;c.,  they  were 
pleased  to  appoint  me  chairman,  and  Major 
Mordecai,  who  was  at  the  head  of  the  arsenal  at 
Washington,  an  officer  of  great  scientific  attain- 
ments, rendered  valuable  assistance  as  recording 
secretary.  We  carefully  examined  the  arms  of 
American  and  foreign  manufacture,  some  of 
which  were  of  the  most  costly  description,  and 


204  PASSAGES    IN 

awarded   medals  to  the  best  of  our  judgment, 
and  without  partiality. 

One  afternoon  Mr.  Collins,  the  well  known 
principal  proprietor  of  the  fine  line  of  ocean 
steamers  from  America  to  England,  named 
after  him,  (the  rivals  of  the  Cunard  line)  shewed 
me  over  one  of  his  ships  ;  she  seemed  in  high 
order,  and  the  accommodations  very  luxurious. 
It  was  understood  that  the  American  steamers 
did  not  last  so  long  as  the  British,  owing  to  the 
great  quantity  of  fuel  consumed,  and  the 
consequent  "  wear  and  tear  "  of  the  machinery 
in  the  desire  to  beat  the  Cunard  line ;  this  is 
now  altered.  From  what  I  saw  and  heard  of 
Mr.  Collins,  I  should  think  he  follows  what  I 
observed  hung  up  in  his  office,  whilst  waiting  for 
him. 

A  GOOD  RULE. 

'Tis  well  to  walk  with  a  cheerful  heart, 

Wherever  our  fortunes  call, 
With  a  friendly  glance  and  an.  open  hand, 

And  a  gentle  word  for  all ; 
Since  life  is  a  thorny  and  difficult  path, 

Where  toil  is  the  portion  of  man, 
We  all  should  endeavour,  whilst  passing  along, 

To  make  it  as  smooth  as  we  can. 

Mr.  Collins  is  greatly  to  be  sympathised  with 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  205 

for  the  terrible  domestic  calamity  which,  after 
this,  befell  him,  when  the  Arctic  steamer  was 
run  down  and  lost  off  the  coast  of  Newfound- 
land. 

Major  Rowan  and  myself  paid  our  respects 
to  the  Commander-in-Chief  of  the  American 
army,  General  Scott,  who  fought  well  for  his 
country  against  our  troops  in  the  war  of  1812, 
and  also  was  the  chief  in  the  Mexican  war. 
He  is  a  tall  and  robust  man,  with  white  hair 
and  a  quiet  demeanour,  he  was  suffering  from 
the  effects  of  a  recent  accident,  having  tripped 
up  and  fallen  over  a  projecting  stone  in  the 
street. 

He  said,  though  jealousy  and  animosity  had 
led  to  the  last  war  with  Britain,  yet  since  then  a 
kindly  feeling  had  sprung  up  towards  the  old 
country.  It  would  be  absurd  to  go  to  war  now, 
our  interests  were  so  blended,  there  was  enough 
in  the  world  for  both  nations  without  quarrel- 
ling, and  he  thought,  that  if  there  ever  arose  any 
combination  against  England,  that  her  American 
descendants  would  immediately  step  forward  to 
assist  her.  The  progress  of  Canada  was  dis- 
cussed, in  assisting  at  the  invasion  of  which, 
long  ago,  the  General  was  severely  wounded  at 


206  PASSAGES   IN 

the  battle  of  Lundy's  Lane.  It  was  considered 
that  Canada  would  be  a  fatal  gift  to  the  States, 
and  would  cause  a  dissolution  of  the  Union. 

Among  the  remarkable  objects  'I  saw  at  New 
York  at  this  time,  was  a  group  consisting  of  an 
Indian  and  his  horse  in  the  fatal  embrace  of  an 
immense  serpent,  all  converted  into  stone,  and 
said  to  have  been  found  in  a  forest  of  South 
America.  The  horse  was  on  the  ground,  the  man 
stooping  over  it,  and  partly  concealed  by  the 
folds  of  the  monster.  This  was  not  exhibited 
by  Mr.  Barnum,  but  the  bearded  lady  was,  and 
she  was  certainly  a  wonder.  Madam  Clofulhia 
was  a  Swiss,  age  about  34,  and  was  born  with  a 
beard,  and  as  she  told  me,  had  a  son  ten  years 
old  with  whiskers.  She  was  a  short  and  stout 
person,  with  a  sallow  complexion,  not  a  happy 
expression ;  and  she  invited  me  to  touch  her 
black  whiskers  to  see  "  there  was  no  mistake," 
and  there  was  none. 

Two  men  and  a  woman  from  the  country, 
sight-seeing,  came  up  to  the  bearded  lady,  who 
was  sitting  in  the  middle  of  the  room,  and  one 
of  the  men,  touching  her  bare  shoulder,  as  if 
it  had  been  a  piece  of  statuary,  remarked,  "  there 
is  har  (hair)  here !" 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  207 

We  were  very  hospitably  entertained  by  my 
friend  Mr.  Hoge,  and  I  was  much  pleased  to 
meet  again,  among  other  old  friends,  the  very 
intelligent  Mr.  S.  Ruggles.* 

We  left  the  great  pulse  of  New  York  beating 
high  and  strong,  there  is  no  rest  there.  A 
country  manager  hired  a  man  to  blow  a  horn, 
he  rested  for  a  time. 

"  Why  don't  you  blow  ?"  cried  the  manager. 

"  There's  a  rest  of  fifteen  bars  here,"  said  the 
man. 

"  I  hired  you  to  blow,  not  to  rest,"  said  the 
other.  The  busy  world  is  always  blowing  at 
New  York,  and  sometimes  there  does  not  seem 
time  to  finish  what  had  been  begun  in  earnest. 
A  cook  was  asked  her  opinion  of  a  particular 
child.  "  It  does  not  seem  done  enough,"  said 
the  cuisiniere.  One  thing,  however,  seemed  to 
have  been  well  finished  here  at  this  time ;  that  was 
a  fire-proof  safe.  The  inventor,  Mr.  Wilkes, 
bet  five  hundred  dollars  as  to  its  power  of 
standing  fire  ;  and  he  won  his  wager.  It  was 
severely  tested  for  four  hours,  then  opened,

After  this,  we  returned  to  Canada,  hearing, 
by  the  way,  in  a  rail-car  a  discussion  on  slavery 
between  a  man  from  the  South  and  a  New 
Englander.  The  last  said : 

"  I  may  give  it  as  my  opinion  that  if  slavery 
war  (were)  unprofitable,  you  would  let  the  slaves 
go  free ;  but  as  long  as  you  make  money  by 
them,  slavery  will  go  on.  Almighty  money, 
that  is  the  God  the  Yankees  worship." 

"  Why,  if  slaves  were  free  to-morrow,"  said 
the  other,  "  you  would  require  an  army  to  pro- 
tect the  whites." 

"  Well,  you  have  got  an  army,"  said  the 
New  England  man.  "  We  have  got  none  here, 
in  Vermont.  One  Yankee  boy  and  his  rifle 
will  keep  everything  quiet  here.  There's  a 
mob  now  and  again,  that  is  the  everlasting 
politicians,  because  we  are  governed  by  law" 

"  Yes,"  said  the  southerner,  "  more  law  than 
justice  ;"  and  there  was  a  laugh  all  round. 

Lord  Elgin  having  gone  to  England,  General 
Sir  William  Rowan  became  the  Administrator

THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  209 

Quebec,  near  which  the  Governor-General's 
residence  at  Spencer  Wood  is  one  of  the  most 
agreeable  in  America,  high  above  the  St.  Law- 
rence, in  a  park  of  seventy  acres.  Gardens,  trees, 
walks,  fine  prospects  and  fine  air  all  combined 
in  rendering  it  attractive.  Looking  over  the 
bank  in  front,  one  saw  a  characteristic  Canadian 
prospect,  a  perfect  "  desert  of  rafts,"  which  had 
been  floated  down  for  shipment  in  the  fleet  of 
vessels,  timber  which  lay  under  the  shadow  of 
the  rock  of  the  citadel. 

Close  to  Spencer  Wood  is  the  path  by  which 
the  chivalrous  Wolfe  arid  his  troops  climbed 
to  fight  the  battle  of  the  plains  of  Abraham ; 
and  not  far  off,  a  handsome  pillar,  surmounted 
by  a  Roman  helmet  and  sword,  erected  by 
the  troops,  in  Canada,  in  the  time  of  Sir 
Benjamin  D'Urban,  marks  the  spot  where  he 
fell.  A  well  beside  this,  afforded  him  his 
last  draught. 

People  at  Quebec  live  nearer  each  other  than 
in  Montreal,  and  are  very  sociable  and  hospitably 
disposed.  There  were  big  and  little  dinners, 
balls,  private  theatricals  and  music.  When  the 
winter  set  in  with  all  its  Siberian  force,  we  put

straight  on  end  over  fields  and  orchards.  On 
one  occasion  of  a  fancy  ball  in  town,  and  the 
three  miles  of  road  from  Spencer  Wood  being 
impracticable  for  horses,  owing  to  a  partial 
thaw,  and  followed  by  a  hard  frozen  surface, 
whilst  the  branches  of  the  trees  by  the  wayside, 
cased  in  ice,  rattled  like  immense  bundles  of 
arrows.  Aides-de-Camp  Wetherall,  Colborne 
and  myself  were  obliged  to  "  pursue  pleasure 
under  difficulties,"  by  snow-shoeing  into  town 
in  our  blanket  coats,  and  with  our  fine  clothes 
dragged  over  the  snow  in  a  hand  sleigh  or 
toboggin. 

But  the  grand  doings  in  winter  are  at  the 
frozen  cone  of  snow  and  spray,  eighty  feet  high, 
or  more,  below  the  Falls  of  Montmorenci,  where 
crowds  of  people  "  in  fine  spirits"  go  out  to

Of  late  there  have  been  skating  rinks  covered 
in,  where  ladies  and  gentlemen,  in  appropriate 
costume,  display  their  graces  and  improve 
their  health.  Curling  is  practised  with  ani- 
mation at  Quebec.  As  a  native  of  Caledonia, 
I  had  a  severe  day  on  the  open  ice  as  umpire 
at  a  grand  match  between  the  Scotch  and  the 
Barbarians,  as  all  others  are  facetiously  called; 
and  then  followed  a  big  dinner  and  speeches. 

A  large  Snow  Fort,  complete,  with  ditch, 
bastions,  a  high  keep  and  flag  staff  in  the  centre, 
an  abattis  of  boughs  and  trous-de-loup,  or  pit- 
falls, outside,  was  constructed  after  some  weeks' 
work,  at  Spencer  Wood,  by  means  of  the  forty 
men  of  the  66th  Regiment  stationed  there  as  a 
bodyguard.  A  party  of  cavalry  was  improvised 
amongst  the  grooms  for  reconnoitering  pur- 
poses ;  defenders  were  placed  in  the  fort,  and  five 
hundred  men  of  the  two  Regiments  at  Quebec, 
the  66th  and  71st,  with  a  battery  of  the  Royal 
Artillery,  were  marched  out  to  attack  it  with 
scaling  ladders,  &amp;c.,  in  the  month  of  March. 
When  martial  excitement  was  at  its  height  all

The  programme  was,  that^an  attack  being 
threatened  on  the  fort,  and  the  enemy  ap- 
proaching, a  reconnaissance  took  place  with  the 
cavalry,  who  retired  on  ascertaining  the  strength 
and  apparent  designs  of  the  enemy.  The  fort 
was  then  invested,  when  a  sortie  was  made  from 
the  fort  by  light  infantry  on  snow  shoes. 
The  guns  of  the  artillery  opened  on  the  fort 
for  a  time,  and  the  skirmishers  retired.  The 
enemy  now  closed  on  the  fort,  their  riflemen 
in  advance,  and  were  received  by  volleys  from 
the  fort.  The  enemy  retired  twice,  and  finally 
advanced,  covered  by  a  heavy  fire,  to  the  ditch. 
Some  however,  including  a  fine  tall  fellow, 
Segrave,  of  the  71th,  who  led  them,  disappear- 
ing, to  their  surprise,  in  the  trous-de-loup  at  the 
salients.  The  ladders  were  lowered  into  the 
ditch,  some  carried  to  the  opposite  parapets, 
which  were  scaled  amidst  showers  of  snow 
balls,  when  a  short  scuffle  took  place  inside,  in 
which  some  bruises  took  place.  A  part  of  the 
garrison,  not  captured,  retired  to  the  citadel, 
intending  to  hold  out,  but  the  eager  assailants 
applying  ladders  to  it  also,  the  place  fell,  and 
the  flag  was  hauled  down  amidst  great  cheering. 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  213 

Great  interest  was  occasioned  by  the  garrison 
snow  shoe  races  for  prizes  this  winter ;  and  the 
citizens  became  so  excited  after  the  second  com- 
petition, that  they  subscribed  for  a  third,  both 
officers  and  men  contended,  also  some  civilians 
at  the  last.  Marvellous  jumps  were  taken  over 
hurdles,  and  much  amusement  was  occasioned 
by  the  accidents  which  occurred,  without  any 
injury  to  the  person,  from  the  keenness  with 
which  the  contest  was  kept  up. 

After  the  fall  of  Quebec,  in  the  winter  of 
1760  a  large  French  and  Indian  force  coming 
from  the  direction  of  Montreal,  under  M.  Levi, 
attempted  to  surprise  the  city,  and  beat  back  the 
troops  who  were  incautiously  and  hurriedly, 
sent  out  against  them.  M.  Levi  afterwards 
besieged  Quebec  for  some  time,  but  reinforce- 
ments arriving  from  England,  the  siege  was 
raised. 

A  highly  respectable  and  energetic  French 
Canadian  gentleman,  and  Scotch  by  his  mother's 
side,  the  Honourable  Colonel  Tache,  collected 
subscriptions,  in  the  spring  of  1854,  to  erect  a 
monumental  pillar  at  the  scene  of  the  desperate 
conflict  which  took  place  between  part  of  the 


214  PASSAGES    IN 

Quebec  garrison  and  the  force  of  M.  Levi, 
round  an  old  windmill,  on  the  St.  Foy  road, 
and  not  far  from  the  residence  of  my  esteemed 
friends,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Okill  Stewart  of  Holland 
House. 

The  bones  of  the  dead  were  to  be  seen  in 
summer  on  the  banks  of  a  rivulet  there,  and  they 
were  being  washed  away  at  the  melting  of  the 
snow  in  spring.  A  great  procession,  accompanied 
with  a  funeral  car,  was  got  up,  at  which  the 
garrison  assisted,  to  collect  these  honoured  re- 
remains,  and  re-inter  them  where  British,  French, 
and  Indians,  once  foes,  were  now  mingling  their 
dust. 

This  affair,  coupled  with  the  happy  union 
of  the  flags  of  France  and  England  in  the  ex- 
pedition organizing  for  the  East,  had  the  best 
effect  in  dissolving  lingering  jealousies  of  the  two 
races  in  Canada,  where  it  is  the  sincere  desire  of 
the  government  that  all  the  colonists  should  be 
on  a  perfect  equality,  and  as  equally  partake  of 
the  offices  and  appointments  under  the  Crown  as 
old-country  men. 

In  fact,  a  colonist  has  now  a  much  better 
chance  of  getting  office,  if  he  is  capable  of 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  2 1  5 

holding  one  in  his  own  colony,  than  an  old- 
country  man  with  interest,  and  seeking  employ- 
ment in  a  colony.  This  I  was  told  by  the  late 
Lord  Sydenham,  Governor-General,  when  desir- 
ing to  be  employed  in  exploring  and  surveying  in 
the  Oregon  Territory. 

There  was  certainly  no  want  of  variety  this 
winter  in  Quebec.  Among  other  incidents  of 
note,  was  the  burning  of  the  fine  Parliament 
House  there.  It  overlooked  the  broad  St.  Law- 
rence, and  occupied  a  commanding  site  in  the 
Upper  Town,  and  where,  at  the  conquest  of 
Canada,  stood  the  Bishop's  palace.  It  consisted 
of  a  centre,  ornamented  with  a  handsome  portico 
and  dome,  and  two  projecting  wings.  The 
whole  had  been  built  at  great  expense ;  it  con- 
tained the  Halls  of  the  Legislative  Council,  and 
House  of  Assembly,  a  large  and  valuable  library, 
the  chambers  of  many  of  the  public  offices, 
an  interesting  Museum  of  the  Literary  and 
Historical  Society,  and  pictures  of  British 
Sovereigns. 

The  want  of  a  watchman  inside,  and  an  over- 
heated stove,  were  the  causes  of  the  catastrophe, 
at  which,  though  the  cold  was  intense,  20°  below

zero,  Colonel  Grubbe,  the  commandant,  with  his 
regiment,  the  66th,  Colonel  Stack,  with  the 
71st  Light  Infantry,  Colonel  Thomdyke,  with 
his  Artillery,  and  Colonel  Wolfe  and  the  Royal 
Engineers,  assisted  most  vigorously  and  zea- 
lously. Yet  the  wooden  partitions  and  stair- 
cases inside  got  the  better  of  them,  and  the 
building  was  burnt  out.  Some  of  the  books, 
pictures,  and  furniture  were  saved.  The  city 
firemen  could  render  little  assistance  for  want  of 
water.  Another  large  building  was  immediately 
after  in  the  course  of  being  fitted  up  for  the 
Parliament,  and  that,  too,  was  burnt  before  it  was 
used,  owing  to  the  accumulation  of  shavings  by 
the  workmen,  and  perhaps  some  carelessness 
about  a  pipe.  Finally,  the  Parliament  took  refuge 
in  a  handsome  Music  Hall,  which  was  hired  for 
its  deliberations. 

Summer,  at  length,  came  round,  and  it  was 
a  hot  one.  No  rain  for  weeks,  and  the  djist 
thick  on  the  roads  and  streets  of  Montreal 
and  Quebec ;  there  was  an  outbreak  of  cholera ; 
and  some  esteemed  citizens  were  cut  off.  Ge- 
neral Rowan  took  a  farm-house  on  the  Lo- 
wer St.  Lawrence,  for  sea-side  quarters,  at  the 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  217 

scattered  French  Canadian  village  of  Cacona ; 
and  the  air  and  drives  were  very  enjoyable 
there. 

Nearly  opposite  Cacona,  the  great  river 
Saguenay,  poured  through  its  immense  walls  of 
rock  its  deep  flood  into  the  St.  Lawrence,  and 
there  was  the  fine  mountain  range  on  the  north 
shore  of  the  latter  river,  on  whose  waters  the 
white  sails  of  merchant  vessels  were  continually 
observed,  giving  constant  life  to  one  of  the 
finest  pictures  that  can  be  conceived. 

From  Quebec  to  Metis,  two  hundred  miles 
of  excellent  roads  conduct  one  through  a 
primitive  French  Canadian  population.  The 
inhabitants  cultivate  their  fields  and  gardens  there 
in  peace,  and  their  pastures  are  ever  green,  whilst 
in  other  parts  they  become  yellow  in  the  fall  of 
the  year. 

The  glittering  tin  roofs  and  spires  of  the 
churches  are  frequently  observed  along  the  river  . 
and  the  population,  from  the  social  disposition 
of  the  people,  may  be  said  to  be  continuous, 
though  not  thickly  set. 

The  houses  are  picturesque,  wooden  generally, 
of  one  story,  with  high  roofs  and  dormer  win- 


218  PASSAGES    IN 

dows ;  inside  perfectly  clean,  and  a  clay  oven 
usually  outside.  At  the  side  of  the  great  barns 
there  is  seen  a  peculiar  kind  of  windmill  for 
grinding  the  corn. 

The  priests  have  great  influence  amongst 
these  simple  people,  and  there  are  many 
excellent  men  among  the  ecclesiastics,  who 
have  got  a  college  at  St.  Anne's.  Large  crosses 
are  seen  by  the  wayside,  and  sometimes 
figures  of  our  Saviour  and  the  Virgin,  as  large 
as  life. 

The  men  are  small,  of  dark  complexion,  and 
dressed  in  home-spun  cloth ;  the  women,  in 
summer,  are  in  printed  gowns,  and  with  enor- 
mous, but  useful,  straw  hats.  All  are  per- 
fectly polite  to  one  another,  and  to  strangers.  It 
takes  some  time  to  understand  their  patois 
French. 

It  was  in  a  house  of  one  of  these  worthy 
habitans,  that  we  lived  for  some  weeks.  M. 
Bonenfant  was  an  old  bachelor  with  a  bustling 
housekeeper,  and  some  nephews  to  assist  him  on 
his  farm ;  and  his  avocations  were  various  in- 
deed. At  one  time,  he  might  be  seen  felling  a 
tree ;  next  making  hay  with  a  wooden-pronged 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  219 

fork ;  then  on  his  knees  milking  a  cow  ;  again  he 
would  be  observed  at  the  wash-tub,  preparing 
his  shirt  for  Sunday ;  and,  lastly  of  an  evening, 
occupying  himself, '  spectacles  on's  nose/  with  the 
spinning-wheel.  No  occupation  seemed  to  come 
amiss  to  Bonenfant. 

Judge  Meredith,  greatly  esteemed  in  his  pro- 
fession, had  taken  a  house  not  far  off,  and  as  we 
were  in  the  best  fishing  region  in  Lower  Canada, 
we  arranged  to  wet  our  lines  at  lakes  Vaseaux 
and  St.  Simon,  the  latter  thirty  miles  from 
Cacona.  We  went  in  a  caleche,  and  hired  canoes, 
and  caught  many  dozen  of  excellent  trout  with 
the  fly,  in  fact,  I  never  saw  fish  so  abundant  be- 
fore as  here  on  the  south  shore  of  the  St. 
Lawrence. 

On  the  north  shore,  there  is  a  mine  of  wealth 
in  the  way  of  salmon  fishing,  which  is  not  ge- 
nerally known.  One  river  in  Scotland  used  to 
rent  for  £12,000  a  year — there  are  thirty  rivers 
below  Quebec  as  good.  With  new  and  increas- 
ing means  of  transport,  fresh  salmon  could  be 
caught  N.  E.  of  the  Saguenay,  and  sent  to  the 
United  States,  &amp;c.,  under  most  remunerative 
circumstances.  A  couple  of  armed  schooners 


220  PASSAGES    IN 

cruising  there  would  prevent  poaching  and  pre- 
serve order.  When  formerly  employed  explor- 
ing and  surveying  in  the  forests  of  New  Bruns- 
wick, and  in  Canada  East,  for  a  military  road,  I 
was  grieved  to  see  so  many  fine  rivers  destroyed 
by  dams  across  them,  and  no  Queen's  gap, 
so  that  the  fish  could  not  get  up  to  spawn 
in  the  proper  beds,  and  when  they  at- 
tempted it  below,  the  spawn  was  carried  off 
by  floods  or  devoured  by  other  fish.  Valuable 
streams  were,  and  are,  ruined  for  the  sake  of 
benefiting  one  individual.  It  is  to  be  hoped 
the  Government  will  see  to  this  important 
matter. 

The  month  of  June  is  that  in  which  gentlemen 
fishermen  engage  pilot  schooners  at  Quebec, 
freight  them  with  tents,  skiffs,  cooking  apparatus, 
preserved  meat,  liquors,  fishing  tackle,  fowling 
pieces,  mosquitoe  nets,  &amp;c.,  and  move  down 
below  the  Saguenay,  for  what  is  considered  by 
many,  more  exquisite  sport  than  any  other  in 
the  world,  the  pleasure  of  catching  a  fine 
salmon. 

Five  or  six  weeks  are  sometimes  spent

THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  221 

rivers  in  salmon  fishing.  The  expense  may 
be  about  100  dollars  for  each  person,  if  three 
engage  a  fishing  smack,  and  the  return  may 
be  fifty  or  sixty  fish  with  the  rod,  and  a 
large  brown  or  black  fly.  The  Esquimaux 
Indians  there,  spear  the  fish  by  torch  light, 
also  some  white  barbarians  do  the  same. 
The  white  porpoise  of  the  lower  St.  Lawrence 
is  a  curiosity  in  these  waters,  where  there 
is  also  seal  catching,  and  plenty  of  sea-fowl 
shooting 

The  Bay  of  Chaleur,  New  Brunswick,  is  like- 
wise visited  by  fishermen  for  its  fine  salmon  rivers, 
particularly  the  Ristigouche  with  its  wild  scenery 
and  rapid  career.  Micmac  Indians  will  be  found 
about  it.  There  is  a  magnificent  pool  for 
salmon  below  the  great  falls  of  the  river  St. 
John,  near  where  the  writer  owns  a  farm  of 
fine  land.  The  Nipissiquit,  also,  in  New 
Brunswick,  is  a  favourite  salmon  river,  and 
the  Gold  river  in  Nova  Scotia.  I  fished  in 
the  Mirimachi,  and  ate  delicious  salmon  there 
for  some  weeks,  without  ever  tiring  of  it. 
Rod  fishing  in  these  countries,  however,  re- 
quires this  preparation,  a  few  drops  of

The  gentleman  fisherman  who  visits  the 
Lower  St.  Lawrence  in  his  schooner  will  see 
sights  like  this:  he  is  becalmed,  maybe,  and 
there  is  a  partial  fog  on  the  water ;  he  sees  a 
strange  object  near ;  by  and  bye  it  turns  out  to 
be  a  whaleboat  with  a  crew;  then  another  is 
seen,  and  the  white  sails  of  a  whaling  schooner. 
A  couple  of  whales  blow ;  the  boats  row  towards 
one  of  them,  perhaps  a  ninety-feet  whale ;  the 
harpooner  rises  in  his  place,  and  drives  his 
weapon  into  the  whale ;  it  rushes  off  and  circles 
for  three  miles,  the  boat  being  towed  after  with  a 
wall  of  water  on  each  side  of  its  bows.  At  last 
the  monster  stops ;  the  boat  approaches  again ; 
twice  is  a  lance  plunged  rapidly  into  its  vast 
back ;  with  a  roar  of  pain  and  rage  its  head  and 
shoulders  are  thrust  above  the  surface;  after 
many  struggles  for  life,  at  last  it  vomits 
blood,  falls  back,  and  is  secured.  The  other 
whale  may  be  its  cub,  which  swims  con- 
tinually round  its  mother,  and  is  also  soon 
lanced.  A  round  of  good  beef  is  taken  out 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  '223 

from  under  the  fin,  which  eats  well ;  but 
with  the  exception  of  this  particular  morsel, 
the  meat  of  a  whale  tastes  like  an  old 
lamp.

in  the  shape  of  savage  men  and  wild  beasts,  so 
I  was  not  contented,  when  about  to  leave 
America,  till  I  had  sailed  on  the  waters  of  that 
vast  inland  sea,  Lake  Superior,  so  clear,  so 
deep,  surrounded  with  alpine  rocks  and  cliffs, 
fringed  with  mighty  woods,  falls  of  flashing 
water  pouring  into  it,  at  many  most  picturesque 
localities,  and  its  shores  abounding  in  exhaust-

northern  part,  and  abounding  in  the  finest  lake 
salmon  and  white  fish,  which  the  Indians  of

his  pilgrimage  at  the  bright  waters  of  the  River

If  we  had  yet  to   see    all    that    the   above

voyage  promises,  there  is  no  undertaking  we 
would  sooner  engage  in  for  three  or  four 
months  in  summer,  than  a  voyage  from 
England  to  Lake  Superior,  and  we  now 
heartily  recommend  it  to  the  notice  of  our 
enterprising  yachtsmen. 

Expecting  a  summons  to  the  east  before  long, 
to  assist  in  the  great  contest  which  was  then 
raging,  and  for  which  at  its,  commencement,  as 
was  my  duty  (having  been  in  Russia  and  in  the 
Crimea  before)  I  had  volunteered,  in  the 
autumn  of  1854,  I  got  leave  to  pay  a  parting 
visit  to  some  relations  in  the  West,  resolving 
whilst  there  to  see,  what  I  often  tried  in  vain 
to  do,  Lake  Superior. 

With  a  pleasant  party,  which  I  happened 
to  meet  on  board  the  Champion  steamer, 
commanded  by  a  fine  manly  specimen  of 
a  lake  sailor,  Captain  Sutherland,  we  loosed 
from  the  wharf  at  Lachine,  nine  miles  from 
Montreal,  and  by  Kingston  we  reached 
Toronto. 

In  Canada,  there  is  now  a  considerable  ad- 
mixture of  Americans  among  our  British 
population,  and  a  genuine  Yankee  is  not  un-

common  among  the  settlers ;  our  fine  land 
tempts  them  over  the  lines,  they  make 
improvements,  and  then  "  make  tracks  "  for 
another  Zocation ;  but  they  always  preserve  the 
cool  independence  of  their  original  "  diggings." 
Thus  an  officer  encountered  in  a  narrow 
road  near  New  London,  a  hay  cart  driven  by  an 
American  citizen.  The  bigger  load  usually 
holds  on  its  course,  and  the  lighter  vehicle  is 
expected  to  give  way  to  the  other,  and  whilst 
the  Yankee  held  on  to  the  "  crown  of  the 
causeway,"  our  military  friend  disputed  this 
arrangement  with  his  dog  cart ;  both  pulled 
up,  and  the  officer  taking  a  newspaper  from 
his  pocket,  read  it  for  a  time,  and  then  crumpled 
it  up.  "  Mister,"  said  the  owner  of  the  hay 
cart,  "  if  you're  done  with  that  paper,  I'll  take  a 
spell  of  it."  After  this  "the  Britisher" 
seeing  it  was  useless  to  hold  out  any  longer, 
gave  in. 

Though  the  navigation  of  its  lakes  and  rivers 
has  been  of  the  greatest  use  and  advantage  to 
Canada  in  summer,  and  the  frozen  tracks  over 
the  snow  have  facilitated  intercourse  and  traffic 
during  winter,  yet,  in  this  rapidly  progressive 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  229 

age  there  was  a  call  for  railroads  here  as  else- 
where, so  that  in  summer  and  winter  one  might 
pass  freely  along  the  length  and  breadth  of  the 
land. 

The  Canadians  felt  their  way  with  some 
short  railroads,  next  the  Montreal  and  Port- 
land, and  then  the  great  undertaking  of  the 
Grand  Trunk  Railroad,  connecting  the  chief 
cities  and  extending  a  length  of  850  miles, 
was  begun,  chiefly  with  British  capital,  and 
is  now  just  completed.  The  vast  and  fertile 
regions  of  Michigan,  Minesota,  Wisconsin, 
and  the  Far  West  generally,  of  the  American 
States,  will  be  thus  connected  with  the  St. 
Lawrence  and  the  Atlantic  at  all  seasons  of  the 
year. 

The  giant  work  on  the  line  of  the  Grand 
Trunk  of  Canada,  is  the  Victoria  bridge,  the 
cost  of  which  is  estimated  at  £1,250,000.  Its 
great  square  iron  tube,  two  miles  long,  rests  on 
24  lofty  stone  piers  100  feet  high,  with  sharp 
edges  up  the  stream  of  the  St.  Lawrence  above 
Montreal,  to  cut  and  splinter  the  large  sheets  of 
ice  which  descend  on  it  in  November.  The 
span  between  each  pier  is  242  feet,  and  350 


230  PASSAGES   IN 

over  the  navigable  channel  in  the  centre.  The 
Victoria  bridge,  constructed  on  the  principle  of 
the  Britannia  bridge  at  home,  will  be  well  worth 
a  voyage  across  the  Atlantic  to  examine  it, 
besides  the  peculiarities  of  the  works  on  American 
railroads  in  general. 

The  progress  of  Canada  has  been  immense 
since  I  first  landed  at  Montreal  on  a  mud  bank 
a  number  of  years  ago,  before  the  splendid 
stone  quays,  to  be  compared  only  to  those  on 
the  Neva  at  St.  Petersburgh,  were  built,  when 
a  sailing  vessel  sometimes  took  a  month  to 
complete  the  voyage  of  180  miles  between 
Quebec  and  Montreal,  and  when  the  prospect 
of  having  1400  miles  of  railroad  would  have 
been  considered  an  idle  dream.  But  this  has 
been  realized  and  much  more ;  for  instance,  the 
St.  Lawrence  has  been  tapped  and  sent  by 
water  works  seven  miles  long,  to  the  highest 
buildings  in  Montreal,  under  the  direction  of 
the  Canadian  Engineer  T.  Keefer.  Then  the 
deepening  of  the  rapids,  and  removing  large 
boulders  in  them,  was  an  important  work  in 
progress  when  I  left  Canada,  the  importance  of 
which,  and  its  value  to  the  mother  country 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  231 

cannot  be  over  estimated.  Would  that  many 
British  statesmen  would  only  visit  this  colony 
before  legislating  for  it. 

There  were  several  good  specimens  of  clever, 
calculating  Americans  on  board  the  Champion, 
and  we  soon  got  acquainted,  one  said : 

"  Firewood  is  high  in  Montreal,  ten  dollars  the 
cord." 

"  Then  what  is  your  remedy  ?"  I  enquired. 

"  Why  this,  let  a  smart  Yankee  come  along 
with  a  steam  tug  and  two  barges,  buy  wood  for 
two  dollars  along  the  banks,  and  sell  it  for  five, 
why  don't  some  of  your  folks  lay  hold  of 
this  ?" 

A  Scotch  farmer  from  Chateauguay,  said  that 
all  the  firewood  about  him  was  used,  and  they 
must  now  burn  the  fences,  and  throw  several 
fields  into  one.  He  had  both  French  Canadian 
and  Irish  labourers,  the  former  were  more 
willing  than  the  latter  to  work,  but  did  much 
less,  being  lighter  men. 

We  rounded  the  long  and  low  spit  of  sand 
forming  the  harbour  of  Toronto,  its  fine  build- 
ings and  church  spires  rising  before  us  along 
the  flat  beach,  with  numerous  lake  craft  and 


232  PASSAGES   IN 

steamers  in  the  foreground.  When  I  first  saw- 
Toronto,  in  the  time  of  that  admirable  public 
officer  Sir  John  Colborne,  (Lord  Seaton),  it 
contained  3000  inhabitants,  now  it  numbers 
45,000,  and  when  we  walk  through  its  streets 
and  see  its  handsome  stores,  filled  with  choice 
goods  from  Europe  and  the  States,  and  observe 
the  business  air  of  the  well-dressed  inhabitants, 
the  good  horses  and  vehicles  moving  actively 
about ;  we  cannot  be  surprised  to  hear  that 
property  has  increased  enormously  in  value  here, 
and  that  labour  is  in  great  request,  sometimes 
two  dollars  or  8s.  4d.  per  day  being  the  wages. 
There  is  no  direct  taxation,  the  merchants  and 
traders  are  in  good  credit,  and  education  is 
carefully  attended  to  in  excellent  schools  and 
colleges.  The  fertile  soil  of  the  back  country, 
with  thriving  farms  up  Young  Street  (or 
road)  &amp;c.,  may  have  been  the  chief  cause  of 
the  rapid  growth  of  this  fine  city ;  and  as 
railroads  are  now  radiating  from  it,  its  onward 
progress  will,  no  doubt,  be  amazing. 

Still  let  the  inhabitants  of  Britain,  who  can 
live  in  tolerable  comfort  at  home,  be  made 
aware  that  the  American  climate  is  trying  for 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  233 

many  constitutions,  and  "  ages"  a  person  sooner 
than  that  of  our  native  island.  The  heat  is 
great  in  Toronto  in  summer,  when  the  lake 
becomes  a  great  basin  of  tepid  water ;  and  in 
winter  the  ice  boats  and  skaters  wheel  rapidly 
over  some  feet  of  ice  on  the  frozen  bay,  when 
furs,  and  stoves,  and  all  the  appliances  to  resist  a 
severe  winter  are  in  demand. 

I  drove  out  of  Toronto  to  the  Milton  Mills  of 
Mr.  Gamble  on  the  Humber  River,  and  tarried 
there  for  a  day  or  two  with  his  amiable  family. 
The  country  and  woods  were  very  attractive 
about  Mr.  Gamble's  place,  six  miles  from  Toronto. 
I  also  stayed  a  night  with  my  old  friends,  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Widder,  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Ontario. 
Mr.  Widder  is  the  chief  commissioner  for  the 
Canada  Land  Company,  (proprietors  of  the  great 
Huron  Tract  &amp;c.),  and  is  a  gentleman  highly 
esteemed  for  his  ability,  and  for  his  attention  to 
his  important  duties.  The  company  sell  and  let 
land. 

Next  morning  I  was  up  at  five,  and  off  to  the 
station  of  the  rail  which  led  north  of  Toronto 
towards  Lake  Simcoe,  &amp;c.,  where  formerly  I  had 
ridden  with  the  Lieutenant  Governor  to  see  a 


234  PASSAGES   IN 

mile  of  experimental  wooden  tram -way,  we 
had  now  the  iron  path  extending  towards  the 
Georgian  Bay  of  Lake  Huron.  But  matters 
were  as  yet  conducted  roughly,  the  man 
who  took  me  in  a  cab  to  the  station,  asked 
me  a  dollar  for  the  short  journey,  on  my  object- 
ing to  the  charge,  he  said,  he  had  to  get  up 
and  get  his  breakfast  before  bringing  me 
along. 

Then  there  was  no  cover  for  passengers  at 
the  terminus,  and  the  baggage  was  thrown 
down  on  an  open  platform;  the  conductor 
having  called  out  "  all  aboard  !"  the  cars  began 
to  move  on,  and  as  no  one  had  taken  charge  of 
my  portmanteau  and  bag,  nor  of  twelve  others 
lying  there,  I  called  out  that  the  baggage 
was  being  left  behind,  whereupon  the  guard 
cried : 

"  Get  on  board  yourself,  jump  !  and  we'll 
take  your  baggage  !" 

I  saw  it  thrown  on  board,  and  pitching  my 
roll  of  cloaks  on  the  step  of  one  of  the  cars,  I 
sprung  after  them  catching  hold  of  a  rod  of 
iron.  Now  all  this  was  dangerous  and  very 
bad,  a  lady  could  not  have  taken  a  flying  leap 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  235 

without  the  risk  of  losing  her  life.  But  in 
America,  one  requires  to  keep  the  "  eye  skinned," 
as  the  saying  is,  or  life,  limbs  and  baggage 
may  suffer. 

The  night  before  an  attack  had  been  made 
on  the  train,  with  what  object  it  was  impossible 
to  conjecture.  Three  men  were  observed  at  a 
place  called  the  Cross ;  they  lowered  the  tele- 
graph posts  as  the  locomotive  came  up  and  cut 
the  engineer  under  the  ear  with  the  wire, 
and  followed  this  up  with  a  volley  of  stones 
which  knocked  out  two  of  his  teeth,  he  stopped 
the  engine,  and  ran  back,  but  they  were  off. 

The  sheriff  of  Barrie  was  in  the  car.  We 
stopped  at  a  station  on  Lake  Simcoe,  and  he 
asked  me  to  get  out  and  look  at  a  new  steamer 
there.  To  my  surprise,  I  found  my  baggage  on 
board,  and  about  to  make  a  voyage  without  me 
on  the  lake,  I  got  the  things  back  on  the  cars, 
and  we  reached  Barrie,  when  the  sheriff  politely 
looking  out  for  a  covered  conveyance  for  me, 
I  got  into  it,  and  found  two  handsome 
young  women  in  it;  and  we  journeyed  on 
together  towards  Penetanguishine,  38  miles 
off,  through  the  woods,  and  by  a  rough  road. 


236  PASSAGES    IN 

At  "Hamilton's,"  the  half-way  house,  a 
country  inn,  where  the  young  women  left  us, 
we  stopped  to  refresh.  I  found  some  old  soldiers 
there,  hanging  about;  and,  addressing  myself 
to  a  fine  tall  fellow  who  saluted  me,  and  rejoiced 
in  the  name  of  Paddy  Murphy,  I  asked  him 
his  corps.  He  replied,  the  13th  Light  Dragoons. 
I  said  I  had  been  in  that  regiment  in  India, 
when  immediately,  in  a  state  of  great  excitement, 
he  called  out  to  the  others  (late  of  the  79th 
Highlanders),  "  Oh  !  blood  and  ouns,  here's 
an  officer  of  my  old  corps  !"  and  wanted  to  treat 
me.  I  said,  I  hoped  he  did  not  indulge  in 
drinking ;  and  as  he  was  an  old  Peninsular  and 
had  been  wounded  at  Salamanca,  he  ought  to 
take  care  of  himself,  he  replied  :  "  I  will  die, 
Sir,  and  then  there  will  be  an  end  of  the 
drinking." 

Charles,  the  half-Indian  coachman,  asked  me 
if  I  wanted  some  dinner.  I  said,  I  did ;  and 
he  and  a  friend  of  his,  also  a  bois  brule,  sat 
down  with  me  to  bacon  and  eggs,  cheese  and 
tea.  The  two  were  very  polite  to  me,  and  to 
one  another.  After  our  repast,  a  little  man 
came  up,  looked  at  me,  and  asked  me  if  I  was 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  237 

the  Bishop  of  Toronto.  I  had  a  broad-brimmed 
white  hat  on,  blue  neck-tie,  dark  shooting-coat 
and  vest,  and  thick  42nd  trousers.  J  certainly 
did  not  expect  to  pass  for,  even  in  the  woods,  a 
dignitary  of  the  Church. 

I  replied,  I  was  not  a  bishop,  and  enquired 
why  he  asked.  He  said,  he  was  expecting  the 
Bishop  to  come  along  that  way.  His  daughter 
was  going  to  be  married,  and  he  wanted  her 
to  be  confirmed  first ;  then,  pulling  out  a 
square  of  tobacco,  and  biting  a  piece  off  it,  he 
added,  winking  his  eye  at  the  same  time, 
"I  expect  we'll  be  able  to  marry  her  without 
it." 

As  we  drove  off,  the  dragoon  came  up  to 
shake  hands  with  me,  and  to  borrow  a  quarter- 
dollar,  of  course  not  for  bread. 

The  road  did  not  improve  as  we  went  on 
through  the  forest.  First,  in  a  deep  rut  we 
lost  a  wheel.  This  was  put  on  again.  Next  an 
iron  under  the  pole  broke,  and  the  horses  turned 
round,  and  looked  as  if  to  see  what  had  hap- 
pened. A  stout  fellow  came  up  and  helped  us, 
exclaiming,  "  that's  the  rnusic  !"  as  things 
were  painfully  screwed  into  their  places  with  the 


238  PASSAGES   IN 

drag-chain  and  a  rope.  It  fell  dark,  and  we 
jolted  and  lumbered  on.  Like  the  ship-boy, 

"On  the  tall  and  giddy  mast," 

I  can  sleep  almost  anywhere  ;  but  I  was  suddenly 
awoke  from  a  doze  by  a  violent  pitch  forward 
of  our  vehicle,  which  then  remained  stationary 
with  its  stern  in  the  air.  The  pole,  fore- 
wheels  and  horses  had  become  detached  from 
the  body  of  the  elegant  conveyance,  and  the 
two  half-breeds  were  laughing,  whilst  they  were 
trying  to  hold  on  by  the  reins  and  pick  themselves 
out  of  the  mud.  We  had  lost  an  important 
bolt. 

Charles  said  to  me,  "  Will  you  ride  one  of 
the  horses  to  Penetanguishine,  Sir  ?" 

"  What  will  you  do  with  the  portmanteau  ? 
You  can't  strap  it  on  a  horse." 

"  No,  we  will  leave  it  in  the  bush." 

"  That  won't  do ;  I  will  remain  with  it,  and 
you  go  on  with  a  horse  the  twelve  miles  for 
help." 

Whilst  this  was  being  arranged,  we  heard 
voices  and  the  noise  of  wheels  in  the  wood, 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  239 

and  three  teams  with  waggons  drove  up.  1 
transferred  myself  and  baggage  to  one  of  them, 
and  found  they  were  freighted  with  Lake  Superior 
miners,  their  wives  and  traps.  There  was  a 
discussion  whether  we  should  stay  at  a  wayside 
inn  or  not. 

"  No,  sirree !  I'll  stay  in  h rather,"  said 

one  of  the  wild  fellows,  "  bad  fixings  there,  the 
bread  is  sandy." 

One  of  the  women  who  had  no  cloak  on,  and 
was  sitting  on  the  top  of  some  harness,  com- 
plained of  cold  as  we  "  squirmed  along,"  as 
they  termed  it,  through  the  deep  road,  so  I 
put  a  plaid  about  her. 

"William,"  says  one  of  the  men  to  the 
husband,  "  you'll  lose  your  wife  now." 
"  No  fears,"  I  said,  "  unless  I  want  two." 
At  last,  after  I  had  begun  to  be  fearful  about 
the  state  of  my  habiliments  from  the  rough 
seat,  we  arrived  at  the  inn  at  Penetanguishine, 
and  getting  into  my  travelling  night-bag,  I 
slept  like  a  top  till  half-past  five ;  then,  re- 
freshed with  a  country  walk  before  breakfast, 
cleaned  my  boots  as  I  best  could.  Grease 
is  more  used  than  the  "  incomparable  Warren,"

regions. 

There  is  a  fort  and  barracks  at  Penetangui- 
shine.  A  staff  officer  of  pensioners,  Captain 
Hodgetts,  was  there  with  his  family,  and  he 
had  charge  of  the  pensioners.  The  place  is 
beautiful  in  summer,  with  its  bay,  woods,  and 
heights,  its  wild  fowl  shooting,  and  fishing  ;  but 
in  this  remote  part,  away  from  all  society,  the 
long  winters  are  terrible.  Some  of  the  pen- 
sioners cultivated  their  patches  of  ground,  and 
grew  the  best  potatoes  on  a  sandy  soil,  (Pene- 
tanguishine  means  "  moving  sand")  I  ever  saw. 
Some  drank,  and  some  had  married  young 
wives  ! — with  the  difference  of  years,  20  and 
50,  much  domestic  happiness  could  not  be  ex- 
pected. 

The  Lake  Huron  steamer,  Kaloola,  coming 
in  from  Sturgeon  Bay,  I  put  my  light  baggage 
on  board,  and  we  stood  out  into  the  waters  of 
the  Georgian  Bay,  and  were  assailed  by  a  strong 
wind  and  a  rough  sea.  Captain  Currie  was  a 
good  specimen  of  a  Lake  Huron  skipper,  an 
Argyleshire  Highlander,  never  without  his  blue 
bonnet,  and  hardly  ever  off  the  deck.

*'  I  wish  I  had  never  learnt  this  route,"  he 
said,  "  the  dangers  are  many,  there  is  no  good 
anchorage  to  save  us  from  being  driven  on 
shore,  and  there  are  no  lights  here  to  guide  us, 
the  government  has  not  done  anything  yet  for 
the  lake." 

We  touched  at  Owen  Sound  Settlement  at 
an  early  hour.  On  board  there  were  several 
singular  characters,  including  Ben,  the  porter, 
who  cleaned  boots,  and  wrote  verses  on  the 
passengers,  including  Lord  Bury,  who  passed 
up  about  this  time  with  Mr.  Lawrence  Oli- 
phant,  the  author  of  some  very  clever  works, 
"  Minesota,"  "  The  Shores  of  the  Black  Sea," 
&amp;c.  The  indignation  of  the  Italian  steward,  a 
tidy  man,  had  been  excited  by  the  whittling 
practices  of  an  American,  whom  he  followed 
round  the  deck  to  pick  up  his  chips ;  at  last,  he 
looked  the  unlicensed  whittler  in  the  face,  and 
said :  "  Next  place  we  stop  at,  I'll  go  ashore 

and  get  a  d d  big  log  for  you !"  (to 

whittle). 

It  is  supposed  that  a  man's  character  may 
be  judged  by  his  manner  of  whittling  ; 
thus,  if  he  does  it  away  from  himself,  he  is  a

foolish  and  careless  person,  but  if  he  whittles 
inwards,  he  is  evidently  thoughtful  and  care- 
ful. 

After  passing  Horse  Island,  we  witnessed  a 
lively  scene ;  half-a-dozen  sharp-ended,  and 
broad-beamed  Macinaw  boats,  with  crews  of 
fine,  active- looking,  and  noisy  half-breeds,  fish- 
ing for  salmon,  trout,  and  white  fish,  with  gill 
nets.  They  salt  and  export  the  fish,  and  thus 
make  their  living. 

We  next  reached  the  Indian  settlement  of 
Shebanoning.  The  houses  here,  among  grey 
rocks,  were  the  smallest,  with  door  and  window 
I  ever  saw.  There  was  a  fertile  meadow  behind 
them  where  fat  cattle  grazed,  in  the  fore- 
ground were  some  conical  wigwams,  canoes, 
and  long-haired  squaws,  and  papooses  (or 
children)  swaddled  and  strapped  on  back 
boards,  to  keep  them  out  of  mischief,  Indian 
fashion. 

Settlements  like  this  at  Shebanoning,  and  at 
Manitowaning  on  the  great  Manitoulin  Island, 
(which  we  also  saw)  are  not  likely  to  improve,  if 
the  Indians  are  collected  and  are  left  unmixed 
with  good  settlers  to  set  them  an  example  of 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  243 

industry.  The  poor  red  man,  if  left  alone,  is 
apt  to  live  from  hand  to  mouth,  and  to  rely  on 
the  uncertain  produce  of  the  chase  and  the  fish 
spear ;  but  in  good  hands,  he  can  be  brought  to 
attend  to  seed-time  and  harvest  like  his  white 
brethren.  Thus,  at  Assinaboyne,  in  the  Red 
River  settlement,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Sutherland  col- 
lected some  Crees,  got  them  to  plough,  sow, 
and  plant,  by  setting  them  the  example  himself, 
and  they  all  have  fields  and  gardens,  and  all  the 
winter,  eat  potatoes  with  their  wild  meat,  whilst 
others  are  in  great  want  and  misery. 

If  Indians  are  encouraged  to  cultivate  the 
ground,  and  get  spades,  ploughs,  and  harrows, 
they  may  alter  their  mode  of  life ;  but  if  they 
are  supplied  by  the  white  men  (for  his  advan- 
tage) with  guns,  powder,  and  blankets  only, 
and  are  told,  "  What  is  the  use  of  farming  to 
you?  do  as  your  fathers  did,  hunt,  and  we'll 
take  your  peltries,"  they  will  always  remain 
hunters,  and  the  vast  regions  in  Prince  Rupert's 
Land  continue  merely  a  great  preserve  for  wild 
beasts.

great  Lake  Huron,  the  La  Cloche  Moun-

tains  rising  to  the  height  of  2,000  feet  inland ; 
and  we  presently  approached  the  long  wooded 
heights,  below  which  are  the  Bruce  copper 
mines,  where  we  descried  rows  of  houses,  in- 
dicative of  a  large  establishment.  I  landed  at  a 
wharf,  and  found  an  intelligent  superintendent 
of  the  mines  in  Mr.  Barren.  He  had  prepared 
for  a  visitation  of  cholera,  which  had  been 
moving  through  the  country  ;  had  removed  all 
accumulations  of  dangerous  matter,  and  had 
attended  to  the  drainage.  Out  of  the  600 
people  usually  employed  about  the  mines,  he 
had  not  had  a  death  for  two  or  three  years  ; 
only  one  woman,  and  she  was  ill  when  she 
came  there. 

I  saw  some  Cornish  miners  employed,  also 
French  Canadians,  half-breeds,  &amp;c.  The  wages 
were  £10  a  month  for  those  employed  below 
the  surface,  and  6s.  3d.  a  day  for  surface  work. 
The  miners,  though  they  had  good  wages,  are 
unsettled  in  this  part  of  the  world,  and  "  track 
off"  as  soon  as  they  hear  tales  of  what  is  doing 
elsewhere.  Winter  is  the  best  season  for  work, 
for  then  they  cannot  get  away  by  coasting  along 
in  canoes  for  the  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  &amp;c. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  245 

I  was  rather  interested  about  copper  mining, 
having  brought  from  Africa,  as  I  believed,  the 
first  rich  specimens  of  copper  from  the  Orange 
River;  and  which  region  has  lately  attracted 
much  attention  on  account  of  its  mineral 
wealth. 

At  the  Bruce  mines,  I  saw  the  open  cuttings, 
the  steam  crushing  mill,  the  jigging  house, 
where,  by  washing,  15  per  cent  of  mineral 
was  got,  but  it  was  hoped  that  by  the  new 
dressing  machine,  25  per  cent  would  be 
realized.  A  steamer  takes  the  ore  to  Buffalo 
periodically.  Another  intelligent  gentleman, 
Mr.  Pilgrim,  whom  I  found  at  the  mines,  recom- 
mended extensive  explorations,  by  the  Govern- 
ment, of  the  north  shores  of  Huron  and  Supe- 
rior for  minerals,  and  thus  prevent,  in  future, 
the  practice  of  mining  parties  buying  large 
tracts  of  land  on  the  mere  chance  of  finding 
mineral  wealth,  and  often  throwing  away  their 
money  uselessly. 

This  was  a  region  of  bears,  and  there  was 
much  talk  of  them,  their  habits,  their  emigra- 
tions, points  of  land  where  they  cross  straits  by 
swimming,  and  where  the  Indians  lie  in  wait  for

them,  and  pursue  them  in  canoes,  and  knock 
them  on  the  head  in  the  water.  A  boy  had 
shot  a  oub  and  its  mother  had  fled,  next  day 
she  had  returned  to  the  place  and  partly  de- 
voured her  offspring — a  singular  mode  of  proving 
her  affection.  Elsewhere,  when  a  calf  dies,  the 
body  is  stuffed  with  hay,  and  the  mother  gives 
down  her  milk ;  but,  in  licking  her  dead  off- 
spring, the  lacing  sometimes  gets  loosened, 
the  hay  appears,  and  is  quietly  eaten  by  the 
afflicted  mother,  which  comforts  her,  poor 
thing ! 

I  was  awoke  in  the  night  with  a  disturbance 
on  board  the  '  Kiloola  ;'  a  convivial  party  from 
the  mines  had  been  indulging  too  freely. 
"  Sam  !"  cried  one,  "  you  said  you  would 
beat  me  and  my  brother,  Davison ;  now  I'm 
ready  to  box  you,  and  to  box  naked — real 
thumpin' — that  will  hold — ye  said  so,  me  and 
my  brother !" 

Then  another  man  wanted  to  fight  anybody 
for  half  an  hour,  and  he  told  the  captain 
so,  who  replied,  whilst  trying  his  utmost  to 
preserve  order :  "  There's  one  on  board  who 
will  beat  you  in  ten  minutes."  "  Where  is 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  247 

he — show  me  him  !"  cried  the  other,  and  he 
searched  the  boat  for  him.  Captain  Currie 
meant  the  brandy  bottle  he  had  in  his  hand, 
which  would  soon  knock  him  flat.  One  must 
be  prepared  for  some  rough  scenes  in  these 
remote  '  diggings.' 

After  daylight,  we  sailed  through  the  most 
beautiful  scenery  imaginable,  up  the  St.  Mary's 
River,  twenty-five  miles  long,  and  connecting 
Lakes  Huron  and  Superior,  where  rocks,  trees, 
and  clear  water,  and  pure  air,  exhilirated  the 
senses.  I  saw  no  fort  built  here  to  command 
the  channel,  which  I  was  surprised  at.  It  is  to 
be  hoped,  however,  that  by  the  exercise  of 
common  sense  and  Christian  feeling,  on  our 
side,  and  on  that  of  our  neighbours,  it  will 
never  be  necessary  to  have  here 

"  Towers  along  the  steep." 

We  had  the  high  land  at  Lake  George  on  the 
right;  the  Echo  Lake  there  is  worth  exploring, 
and  pensioners  might  be  advantageously  placed 
about  here.  It  blew  hard  against  us  down  the 
St.  Mary's  River ;  and  where  a  squall  of  rain 
crossed  us,  the  captain  said  there  was  rain  there 


248  PASSAGES    IN 

every  day  of  the  year,  unless  I  suppose  "  when  it 
snawed." 

A  great  object  of  attraction  was  now  before 
us,  and  on  which  we  could  not  cease  to  gaze 
with  intense  interest,  the  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  usually 
called  '  the  Soo,'  or  the  waters  of  the  great 
Lake  Superior  coming  tumbling  and  foaming 
down  past  wooded  islands,  in  the  form  of  a 
broad  rapid,  with  Fort  Brady  and  an  American 
town  on  our  left,  and  a  fort  of  the  Hudson's 
Bay  Company,  and  a  scattered  British  settle- 
ment on  the  right. 

"  Simmary,"  as  the  Americans  call  Sault  Ste. 
Marie,  will  rise  to  be  a  place  of  great  importance, 
as  no  doubt  a  vast  traffic  will  pass  through  it, 
now  that  the  ship  canal  is  constructed,  to  enable 
uninterrupted  navigation  from  the  centre  of  the 
North  American  continent  to  the  Atlantic. 

Mr.  Allan  Macdonald,  a  very  well-informed 
gentleman,  a  chief  of  Lake  Superior  Indians,  and 
with  considerable  influence  among  them,  came 
off,  and  I  accompanied  him  on  shore  to  an  inn 
kept  by  a  very  civil  man,  Mr.  Pym ;  here  we 
found  others  connected  with  mining ;  and 
copper  ore,  and  specimens  of  different  kinds, 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  249 

were  seen  in  all  directions  in  the  house.  In  the 
passages  were  the  bundles,  and  the  rifles,  and 
axes  of  explorers. 

After  dinner,  we  essayed  to  cross  to  the 
American  side  in  a  boat ;  an  equinoxial  gale  was 
blowing ;  a  sail-boat  was  capsized  before  us,  and 
I  loosened  my  shoes  for  a  swim ;  but  we  ma- 
naged to  reach  the  other  side  with  only  a  wet 
jacket.  The  first  remarkable  objects  we  saw, 
were  masses  of  pure  copper  lying  on  the  wharf, 
ready  to  be  shipped  off;  one  was  marked  2000 
and  odd  pounds  weight,  another  4542  pounds! 
These  masses  had  been  painfully  cut  out  of  the 
mine,  by  means  of  a  chisel  and  sledge-hammer ; 
but  miners  find  it  is  easier  to  deal  with  the 
sulphuret  of  copper,  by  means  of  stamping  and 
washing,  and  more  profitable  than  cutting  out, 
with  great  labour  and  expense,  solid  pieces  of 
nearly  pure  metal. 

After  inspecting  Fort  Brady — a  square  enclo- 
sure of  stout  palisading,  and  containing  wooden 
barracks,  where  Captain  Clarke  commanded, 
and  with  him  two  subalterns  and  forty  men — I 
lost  no  time  in  proceeding  to  view  a  work  of 
great  importance,  and  which,  if  some  of  our 


250  PASSAGES    IN 

legislators  in  Canada  had  acted  wisely,  would 
have  been  on  the  British  side ;  I  mean  the  ship 
canal,  a  mile  in  length,  connecting  the  waters  of 
Superior  and  Huron,  and  thus  overcoming  the 
impediment  of  the  '  Soo/ 

We  saw  1200  workmen,  mostly  bearded, 
employed  in  excavating,  blasting,  and  build- 
ng  along  the  course  of  the  canal.  These, 
labourers  were  either  Irishmen  or  Germans.  I 
conversed  with  Colonel  Glen,  the  state  engineer, 
and  I  remarked  there  was  one  objection  I  had 
to  make  to  the  canal,  it  was  on  the  wrong  side. 
"  Well,"  he  said,  "  we  waited  for  you  to  make 
the  canal  on  the  north  side ;  but,  as  you  did 
not,  we  did  it  on  ours." 

The  dimensions  of  the  ship  canal  at  the  Sault 
Ste.  Marie  are  these : 

The  length 5694  feet 

Depth  at  low  water  mark    ...  12  " 

Width  at  the  bottom      ....  64  " 

At  the  water  level 100  " 

At  the  top  of  banks 115" 

The  locks  each  in  length    ...  350  " 

The  width  of  ditto    .  70  " 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  251 

The  cost  of  locations,  construction,  &amp;c., 
is  estimated  at  1,066,751  dollars.  The  exca- 
vations are  mostly  through  rock  and  granitic 
houlders. 

The  locks  are  supposed  to  be  the  largest  in 
the  world.  I  saw  a  quarter  of  a  mile  of  solid- 
faced  masonry,  twenty-five  feet  high,  ten  feet 
thick  at  the  base,  with  heavy  buttresses  every 
twelve  feet,  all  of  which  was  laid  in  hydraulic 
cement ;  and  the  stone  for  facing  was  brough, 
several  hundred  miles  from  Sandusky.  There 
was  increased  cost  of  work  in  1854,  labour  and 
provisions  were  high,  dysentery  also  prevailed 
and  cholera  cut  off  the  constructor  and  head 
carpenter. 

Five  hundred  thousand  acres  of  pine  land,  and 
two  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  acres  of  mineral 
land  have  been  located  in  connexion  with  the 
canal,  that  is  the  Federal  Government  granted  to 
the  state  of  Michigan  seven  hundred  and  fifty 
thousand  acres  to  raise  funds  to  get  the  canal 
through. 

I  went  out  with  two  Indians,  in  a  canoe,  to 
the  bottom  of  the  Sault,  to  see  the  method  of 
catching  white  fish,  here  most  delicious,  with  a 


252  PASSAGES    IN 

scoop-net  at  the  end  of  a  pole.  One  man  stands 
at  the  bow,  looking  over  it  keenly  into  the 
clear  and  rapid  water  ;  the  other  steers,  and 
keeps  the  canoe  up  to  the  proper  places  where 
the  fish  are  running  up  stream.  The  quickness 
of  eye  of  the  Indians  is  wonderful  in  detecting 
the  fish,  and  their  dexterity  great  in  fishing  it 
out.  They  also  use  fish-spears,  and  the  life  of 
a  white  man  was  saved  by  one  of  the  latter 
some  time  ago  here.  Some  adventurous 
young  men,  in  a  sail-boat,  not  taking  any 
Indians  used  to  the  Sault  with  them,  thought 
they  could  shoot  it;  they  got  into  the  boiling 
water;  the  boat  pitched  over,  head  foremost; 
two  managed  to  cling  to  her,  and  escaped; 
one  only  of  those  who  missed  his  hold  of 
the  boat  and  was  hurried  down  the  Sault  was 
saved ;  an  Indian  in  a  canoe  was  fishing 
below,  and  seeing  a  body  come  down  under 
water,  he  drove  his  fish-spear  at  it,  caught  the 
man  by  his  clothes,  and  brought  him  on  shore 
half  dead. 

I  now  put  myself  in  the  hands  of  a  clever 
Indian  named  Canaush,  or  white  man — as  he 
was  fairer  than  the  others  about  him — in  order 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  253 

that  I  might  have  a  short  cruise  on  the  waters  of 
Lake  Superior.  My  friendly  landlord,  Mr. 
Pym,  stowing  away  some  provisions  in  the 
bottom  of  a  fine  '  north '  canoe,  we  commenced 
with  a  crew  of  four  stout  Indians  to  pole  and 
track  up  the  side  of  the  Sault  among  some 
islands,  then  paddled  away  past  Point  aux 
Pins  towards  Gros  Cap  on  the  right,  and  Point 
Iroquois  on  our  left — so  named  from  a  great 
massacre  of  the  tribe  there  by  some  of  their 
enemies,  who  had  surprised  them  when  en- 
camped, and  expecting  no  harm  from  the 
lake  side. 

Lake  Superior  abounds  in  remarkable  natural 
curiosities ;  there  is  an  immense  scope  for  the 
pencil  there,  and  curious  Indian  legends  may  be 
gathered  there,  connected  with  its  lofty  head- 
lands and  caverned  bluffs. 

The  painted  rocks  are  great  objects  to  visit 
at  the  lake,  where  they  stand  out  fantastically 
into  the  water,  are  hollowed  out  into  caverns  by 
the  action  of  the  waves,  and  are  crowned  with 
foliage.  The  lichens  which  cover  the  cliffs  are 
of  various  hues :  yellow,  grey,  burnt  sienna  and 
deep  brown;  whilst  bright  blues,  greens  and 


254  PASSAGES   IN 

scarlets  are  not  wanting — the  effect  of  the 
whole  is  wonderful. 

On  some  of  the  painted  rocks  on  the  lake, 
the  dates  of  early  voyages  are  still  on  the 
lichens,  1764  is  one  of  these;  whilst  rude 
figures  of  alligators,  by  Indians,  indicate  a 
traveller  from  the  Missisippi.  Horses  have 
also  been  scratched  on  the  rocks ;  wild  swans 
drinking  water  with  their  heads  raised;  bears 
pursuing  hunters,  &amp;c.  Pic  Island  is  remark- 
able, as  it  overhangs  its  base  like  a  mushroom, 
and  is  difficult  of  access ;  a  strange  and  silent 
lake,  cliff  bound,  is  in  the  interior  of  the  island. 

At  Gargatua  Point  the  canoe  is  usually 
stopped  over  the  dark  water,  to  allow  the 
stranger  to  observe  the  rocks,  jutting  up  from 
great  depths  in  pinnacles  under  the  surface, 
whilst  the  gigantic  figure  of  Manebajou,  60  feet 
high,  sits  on  his  rock  and  looks  sideways 
and  solemnly  across  the  vast  lake.  Offerings 
are  made  to  him  of  tobacco  by  the  Indians 
to  help  them  to  a  good  wind  for  their  western 
voyages.  The  Indians  also  expect  the  white 
voyager  to  contribute  a  piece  of  money;  any- 
thing will  do  that  has  any  value. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  255 

Isle  Royal,  rich  in  copper,  belongs  to  the 
Americans,  as  do  the  beautiful  Apostle  Islands 
on  the  south  shore.  Thunder  Cape,  a  great 
promontory  on  British  territory,  rests  like  a 
huge  lion,  1,400  feet  high,  by  the  side  of  the 
lake.  Cariboo  Point  is  where  the  most  curious 
of  the  hieroglyphics  are  seen,  handsome  agates 
are  also  found  there. 

Canaush  said,  in  describing  the  perils  of  the 
navigation,  that  he  had  taken  a  young  English- 
man and  his  tutor,  some  years  ago,  to  see  the 
painted  rocks  on  the  south  coast,  it  came  on  to 
blow  so  hard  that  the  canoe  and  passengers 
were  cast  by  the  waves  right  in  among  the  trees 
and  bushes  of  an  island,  where  they  lived  on 
berries  for  six  days,  getting  only  one  white  fish 
from  an  Indian  after  a  walk  of  twelve  miles  for 
it;  at  last,  after  the  wind  subsided,  they  got 
away  from  their  prison. 

The  five  great  Lakes  of  North  America  cover 
an  area  of  90,000  square  miles.  Ontario  is 
180  miles  long,  65  broad,  and  with  an  average 
depth  of  500  feet ;  Erie  250  miles  long, 
80  broad,  and  200  feet  deep;  Huron  200 
miles  long,  160  broad,  and  300  feet  deep; 


256  PASSAGES    IN 

Lake  Michigan  360  miles  long,  108  broad, 
and  900  feet  deep;  whilst  the  great  Lake 
Superior  is  355  miles  long,  greatest  breadth 
160  miles,  mean  depth  988  feet,  its  elevation 
above  sea  level  is  627  feet,  its  area  32,000 
square  miles. 

Lake  Superior  has  its  dangers  like  the  other 
great  lakes,  and  is  subject  to  squalls  and 
tempests,  raising  waves,  unlike  the  long  swell 
of  the  Atlantic,  but  quite  sufficient  to  engulph 
those  who  are  not  prepared  to  encounter  their 
power. 

Mr.  J.  L.  Wilson,  mining  on  Michipicotton 
Island,  said  that,  in  navigating  the  lake  in  open 
boats  in  gales,  when  he  got  on  the  crest  of  a 
wave  and  saw  white  water  on  both  sides,  his  boat 
then  might  sink  for  want  of  support ;  in  which 
case  he  would  suddenly  lower  his  sail  and  let  the 
wave  go  past. 

The  copper  mines  of  Lake  Superior  appear  to 
have  been  worked  long  ago  by  the  Indians 
with  rude  tools,  and  their  descendants,  as  I  under- 
stood, know  from  their  ancestors  of  several 
valuable  mines  still  undiscovered  by  the  white 
men,  and  the  localities  of  other  mines  have  been 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  257 

communicated  from  time  to  time  c  for  a  consider- 
ation;' yet  much,  it  is  said,  remains  to  be 
revealed. 

Though  the  land  close  to  the  lake,  in  many 
places,  appears  barren  and  unfruitful,  and  the 
vegetation  of  black  and  white  spruce,  red  pine, 
birch  and  aspen  stunted,  yet  inland,  at  some 
distance,  this  is  not  the  case ;  trees  increase  in 
size  with  a  deeper  soil,  and  corn,  fruits  and 
flowers,  reward  the  industrious  cultivator  of  the 
useful  and  the  beautiful.  An  American  shewed 
me  some  very  early  wheat  which  he  was  introduc- 
ing at  Lake  Superior,  and  which  he  said  would 
be  ready  for  the  sickle  in  seventy  days  after  it 
was  sown.  He  was  also  taking  up  turnip  seed 
from  Quebec,  where  seed  imported  annually  from 
Scotland  produces  the  best  turnips  ever  tasted 
anywhere. 

The  whole  of  the  coasts  of  the  lake  are  rock 
bound  ;  the  southern,  or  American  shores  are 
comparatively  uninteresting  in  the  way  of  scenery, 
but  the  north,  or  Canadian  shore,  consists  of  a 
series  of  the  most  picturesque  islands,  of  crags 
and  cliffs  descending  sheer  into  the  clear  water ; 
nature  being  exhibited  there  in  her  most  fan- 

VOL.  i.  s

tastic  guise.  There  also  is  the  great  cataract 
of  Kakabeka  (or  straight  downfall)  near  Fort 
William,  130  feet  high  and  450  broad,  besides 
minor  falls  on  the  numerous  rivers  which  feed 
the  lake  from  the  north. 

The  salubrity  of  the  climate  of  Lake  Superior 
is  a  great  recommendation,  and  it  is  very 
bracing  for  invalids  exhausted  by  the  heats  of 
the  south.  The  Americans  say  that  at  Keweena 
Point  the  cold  is  not  more  severe  there  than  in 
the  New  England  States.  The  temperature  of 
the  water  throughout  the  year,  in  the  centre  of 
the  lake,  may  be  stated  to  be  from  30°  to  40°. 
The  lake  from  its  great  depth  does  not  freeze  in 
the  centre,  but  sometimes  as  far  out  as  1 5  miles 
from  the  shore,  the  ice  can  be  traversed  with 
safety  with  dog  sleighs,  that  is  when  storms  are 
not  breaking  it  up.  Bears  and  deer  are  some- 
times seen  taking  an  involuntary  voyage  on  a 
detached  floe  of  ice. 

Dr.  Jackson,  U.S.  geologist,  re-discovered, 
from  the  old  French  records,  those  valuable 
copper  mines  which  have  since  yielded  so  abun- 
dant a  supply  of  ore,  on  the  southern  shores. 
The  operations  of  the  Lake  Superior  copper

company  commenced  in  the  year  1844,  at 
Eagle  River,  were  not  successful ;  but  their 
successors,  the  Phoenix  Company  have  raised 
and  exported  from  the  Cliff  mines,  great 
quantities  of  ore.  They  also  discovered  a 
quantity  of  the  black  oxide  of  iron.  Copper 
has  been  found  in  masses  of  100  tons  weight 
at  Eagle  River,  and  900  tons  are  said  to  have 
been  got  out  in  one  year,  also  silver.  Stamp 
ore  is  that  which  requires  to  be  crushed  along 
with  the  rock  in  which  it  is  diffused,  and  barrel 
ore  consists  of  lumps  which  are  shipped  in 
barrels. 

Before  these  American  lakes  were  touched 
by  railroads,  the  value  of  their  commerce  was 
estimated  at  327,000,000  dollars  ;  what  it  will 
be  since  the  iron  horse  has  reached  them  is  in- 
calculable. 

The  fisheries  of  Lake  Superior  are  very 
valuable,  the  Indians  depend  greatly  on  the  fish 
for  their  living,  though  bears,  Alpine  hares, 
porcupines  and  wild  fowl  reward  the  successful 
hunter. 

From  Fond  du  Lac,  at  the  west  end  of  Supe-

distant,  rolling  its  turbid  flood  over  tne  Falls  of 
St.  Anthony,  and  towards  the  waters  of  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico  ;  but  to  see  and  enjoy  wild  life, 
the  active  traveller  might  arrange,  at  one  of  the 
Hudson's  Bay  Company's  Forts,  an  excursion 
through  the  forest  and  wilderness  land  north- 
east of  Lake  Superior,  and  not  stop  till  he 
reaches  Hudson's  Bay,  and  then  ship  himself 
for  home  at  York  Fort. 

We  paddled,  sang  boat-songs,  refreshed  on 
shore,  and  the  Indians  smoked  their  kinnikinic 
leaves  mixed  with  tobacco.  A  Lake  Superior 
excursion  is  very  enjoyable ;  I  could  not  make  a 
long  exploration,  for  two  reasons,  it  was  late  in 
the  season,  and  it  was  hard  work  paddling" 
against  the  north  wind  in  the  end  of  Septem- 
ber; then  I  expected  to  hear  of  my  regiment 
going  to  the  Seat  of  War  from  Malta,  and  I 
had  the  prospect  of  my  leaving  the  staff  to  join 
it,  so,  as  a  finish  here,  we  "  shot"  the  rapid  of  the 
Sault  Ste.  Marie,  which  we  recommend  to 
those  fond  of  excitement. 

The  Indians  took  a  moderate  "  horn  "  of  fire 
water  before  attempting  this,  tightened  their 
belts,  and  Canaush  going  to  the  post  of  honour, 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  261 

the  head  of  the  canoe,  to  guide  it  with  his 
paddle  and  clear  the  rocks,  the  man  at  the  stern 
had  to  obey  the  short  and  sharp  orders  of 
Canaush. 

The  water  was  sooth  at  first,  and  we  glided 
along  quietly,  the  paddles  dipping  to  keep  the 
head  of  the  canoe  in  the  proper  direction ;  as 
we  looked  at  the  bank  we  observed  the  great 
velocity  of  our  course,  it  increased  as  we  got 
among  loudly  threatening  and  wildly  tossing 
black  waves  with  white  crests,  and  were 
pitched  and  dashed  through  them,  Canaush 
standing  up  in  a  fine  attitude  watching  the 
rocks,  and  the  dangerous  eddies  among  them  ; 
we  shot  past  the  wooded  islands,  and  reached 
the  bottom  of  the  rapid,  amidst  great  noise 
of  angry  waters  boiling  and  sparkling  round 
us. 

A  scene  of  great  excitement  was  exhibited 
elsewhere  on  this  day,  the  Battle  of  the  Alma 
was  being  fought,  and  some  old  and  valued 
friends  were  being  violently  hurried  into  the 
eternal  world,  whilst  we  were  "  shooting"  the 
Sault  Ste.  Marie. 

We  passed  Indians  "  scooping"  for  white  fish,

Indians  tumbling  out  of  their  canoes  and  being 
drowned.  Indulging  in  fire  water  does  not 
suit  such  a  fall  as  that  of  Ste.  Marie. 

Parting  with  some  new  friends  at  "  the  Soo," 
I  embarked  in  a  noble  steamer,  the  'E.  K. 
Collins,'  with  one  of  the  finest  and  loftiest 
saloons  I  ever  saw  afloat,  apparently  16  feet 
high,  painted  with  zinc  colour  and  dead  white ; 
velvet-covered  couches  were  provided,  and  there 
was  a  great  display  of  plate  in  a  glass  case. 
Alas  !  all  this  bravery  could  not  save  her  from 
destruction,  this  was  the  last  voyage  of  the 
'E.  K.  Collins,'  she  was  burnt  to  the 
water's  edge  one  night  near  Sandwich,  and 
some  of  the  hands  and  passengers  perished 
by  drowning. 

We  had  well-dressed  ladies  on  board,  and 
rough-handed  miners,  who  had  "  paid  their 
money  and  took  their  choice"  of  the  best  that 
was  going,  their  appetites  were  "  a  caution." 
We  had  beautiful  clear  weather,  and  enjoyed  the 
scenery  down  the  St.  Mary's  River,  past  Sugar 
Island,  Neebish,  St.  Joseph's,  and  Drummond 
Islands;  on  one  of  these,  a  retired  officer

solaces  himself  with  literature,  and  two  wives — 
Mormon  fashion. 

After  a  time,  we  steered  due  west  for  the 
entrance  of  Lake  Michigan,  and  saw  before  us, 
resting  on  the  waves,  the  Island  of  Michili- 
"nacinac,  or  Mackinaw,  like  a  great  turtle, 
which  its  name  implies.  This  island  is  re- 
markable in  the  history  of  the  west,  as  being  the 
scene  of  the  massacre  of  the  British  garrison  by 
the  Indians,  instigated  by  the  French  colonists 
in  the  days  of  Pontiac.  This  great  war  chief 
flourished  about  the  year  1760,  when  Canada 
passed  from  French  to  British  hands.  A  "  ball 
play  "  was  got  up  outside  the  Fort  to  attract  the 
garrison  to  witness  it,  squaws  were  sent  into 
the  fort,  with  tomahawks  concealed  under  their 
blankets,  unarmed  Indians  strolled  in,  their 
weapons  were  handed  to  them  by  the  women, 
and  inside  and  outside  the  fort,  the  garrison 
were  surprised,  and  fell  under  their  savage 
butchers. 

In-  the  war  of  1812,  Mackinaw  was  surprised 
and  captured  from  the  Americans  by  a  small 
British  expedition,  and  at  the  end  of  the  war  was 
given  up,  as  was  also  Detroit,  Fort  Niagara,  &amp;c.

B$  the  chief  claims  Mackinaw  has  to  our 
attention,  are  its  picturesque  beauty,  its  pure  air 
and  the  deep  clear  water  around  it.  So  healthy 
is  it,  that  the  Americans  say,  "  if  a  man  wants 
to  die,  he  must  go  somewhere  else." 

We  passed  the  Jesuit  Mission  House,  now  a 
hotel,  and  saw  a  curious  old  church  with  a 
quaint  spire.  The  houses  of  the  settlers  were 
built  along  the  beach  in  a  crescent  shaped  bay, 
where  were  also  the  tents  and  canoes  of 
some  Ojibbeway  Indians;  above  was  the  fort 
with  block  houses  at  the  angles,  mounted 
with  brass  guns,  and  over  all  the  stars  and 
stripes  floating. 

It  is  worth  while  to  pass  two  or  three  days 
at  Mackinaw,  good  wholesome  fare  and  mag- 
nificent trout  and  white  fish  will  be  found  there. 
Also  an  old  fort  inland  to  examine,  a  natural 
arch,  the  pinnacle  rock,  and  the  cave  of  sculls, 
where  one  tribe  of  Indians  smoked  another  to 
death  ;  and  wild  raspberries,  whortle,  and  straw- 
berries are  found  in  "  the  fall,"  whilst  one 
wanders  about  inland. 

The  highest  part  of  the  island,  which  is  a 
mass  of  brecciated  limestone,  is  1100  feet  above 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER,  265 

the  lake.  "  There  are  some  rogues  at  Mackinaw," 
said  a  fellow  voyager,  "  it  used  to  be  a  thriving 
place,  but  by  the  change  of  routes,  it's  not 
going  ahead  at  present,  so  there's  some 
sharking  done  here,  a  man  will  engage  to 
take  two  or  three  strangers  out  in  a  boat  to 
fish,  will  put  off  the  time,  and  charge  them 
10  dollars  ahead  before  he  brings  them  back 
again." 

It  came  on  to  blow  after  leaving  Mackinaw, 
and  sea-sickness  laid  low  many  of  the  passengers, 
as  we  passed  the  level  shores  of  Michigan ;  at 
New  Port  we  took  a  large  scow  or  flat  bottomed 
boat  in  tow,  for  what  reason  I  could  not 
ascertain  at  first,  as  it  impeded  our  progress, 
but  when  we  stuck  fast  on  the  shoals  below 
Lake  St.  Clair,  and  heard  this  order  "  Gents 
who  are  not  sick  or  asleep  get  on  the  flat !" 
along  with  a  deck  load  of  potatoes  and  sand 
ballast  in  barrels,  I  found  out  the  use  of  the 
scow. 

The  current  carried  us  some  distance  from 
the  steamer,  but  the  passengers  made  the  best 
of  our  "  unpleasant  fix,"  some  ate  peaches, 
others  played  at  a  gambling  game  called  euchre, 


266  PASSAGES   IN 

the  wind  rose  a  little,  and  an  Irishman  called 
out  "  Bi'  mi'  sowl  we'll  niver  get  to  land !" 
whilst  a  facetious  American  answered,  "  it's  all 
right,  change  your  quids,  trim  the  boat,  and 
take  a  reef  in  that  bag  of  potatoes !"  At  last, 
after  six  hours  knocking  about  on  the  flat, 
we  were  towed  back  safe  to  tea ;  after  which  a 
negro  band,  three  of  the  waiters,  producing  a 
guitar  and  fiddles  in  the  saloon,  and  singing  out 
as  a  sort  of  accompaniment  the  figures  of  the 
dance  :  "  Gents  advance ;"  "  hands  around ;" 
"  Ladies  chain ;"  &amp;c.  induced  those  so  disposed, 
as  it  was  elegantly  termed,  "  to  take  the  knots 
out  of  their  legs." 

I  disembarked  at  the  thriving  city  of  Detroit, 
a  fort  and  village  were  only  there  when  the 
gallant  Sir  Isaac  Brock*  captured  it,  and  now 
it  contains  40,000  inhabitants.  I  put  up  at 
Windsor,  on  the  British  side,  for  the  convenience 
of  getting  away  by  rail  on  Monday,  I  attended 
Divine  Service  at  St.  Paul's  Cathedral  on 
Sunday,  and  was  much  pleased  with  the  slow,

deliberate,  and  distinct  manner  of  reading  there, 
and  which  seems  to  be  the  style  in  the  States 
generally,  and  is  decidedly  the  best,  also  the 
church  service  was  judiciously  shortened, 
though  the  entire  worship  occupied  the  usual 
time. 

Cholera  had  lately  visited  Detroit,  but  though 
severe  at  Pittsburgh  and  elsewhere,  it  was 
moderate  in  its  demands  of  victims  at  Detroit, 
which  is  a  healthy  place.  As  there  are  many 
absent  proprietors  of  the  wild  lands  about 
Detroit,  by  putting  up  at  the  hotel  of  an  old 
sporting  friend  and  excellent  shot,  Mr.  Fellers, 
bears,  deer,  ducks,  and  prairie  "  chickens"  may 
be  got  not  far  off. 

The  Great  Western  Railroad,  through  one  of 
the  most  level,  fertile,  and  promising  regions  of 
Canada  was  now  just  in  operation,  the  names 
not  yet  painted  at  the  stations,  and  the  working 
of  the  line  not  yet  perfected.  I  was  fortunate 
here,  as  I  had  been  with  the  '  E.  K.  Collins.' 
A  terrible  accident,  after  I  had  passed  along 
the  line,  occurred  at  night  (though  accidents 
are  as  yet  comparatively  rare  on  Canadian 
lines)  when  three  or  four  score  people

were  smashed  together,  from  a  sand  truck 
being  left  in  the  way,  and  several  were  killed. 

There  were  few  passengers  going  east  in  the 
car  with  me,  which  was  calculated  to  hold 
fifty.  Elsewhere,  under  similar  circumstances, 
a  down-east  Yankee,  lean  and  tall,  was 
travelling,  and  seated  behind  a  widow,  after 
several  efforts  "he  caught  her  eye"  —  and 
addressed  her, 

"In  affliction?" 

"  Yes  Sir !"  she  replied. 

"  Parents — father  or  mother  ?" 

"No  Sir." 

"  Child  p'raps,  a  boy  or  girl  ?" 

"  No,  Sir,  not  a  child,"  she  answered  "  I  have 
no  children." 

"  Husband  then,  'xpect  ?" 

"  Yes,"  was  the  short  reply. 

"  Hum — cholery  ?  a  tradin'  man,  mebbe  ?" 

"My  husband  was  a  seafaring  man,  the 
captain  of  a  vessel,  he  didn't  die  of  cholera,  he 
was  drowned !" 

"  Oh  !  drowned,  eh  ?"  cried  the  other,  and 
after  a  moment's  consideration,  he  continued, 
"  save  his  chist  ?" 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  269 

"  Yes,  the  vessel  was  saved  and  my  husband's 
effects." 

"Was  they?"  said  the  interrogator,  his  eye 
brightening,  "  pious  man  ?" 

"  He  was  a  member  of  the  Methodist 
Church." 

"  Don't  you  think  you  got  great  cause  to  be 
thankful  that  he  was  a  pious  man,  and  saved  his 
chist  ?" 

"  I  do,"  said  the  widow  abruptly,  and  looked 
out  of  the  window.  For  the  last  time,  the 
Yankee  returned  to  the  attack,  and  leaning 
over  the  back  of  the  seat,  he  said  confiden- 
tially. 

"Was  you  calc'latin'  to  get  marryed 
again  ?" 

"  Sir,"  said  the  widow,  "  you  are  imperti- 
nent !"  and  moved  to  the  other  side  of  the 
car. 

"  'Pears  to  be  a  little  huffy,"  said  the  bore, 
turning  to  a  passenger  behind  him,  "she 
needn't  be  mad,  I  didn't  want  to  hurt  her 
feelings, — what  did  they  make  you  pay  for  that 
umberel  you  got  in  your  hand  ?  It's  a  real 
pooty  one !"

At  Hamilton,  I  visited  friends  living  in 
capital  houses,  Mr.  Isaac  Buchanan  and  Mr. 
White,  on  the  cool  ridge,  whilst  it  was  blazing 
hot  below.  A  handsome  verandah,  glazed,  at 
the  residence  of  the  former  is  worth  trying, 
as  in  winter  it  keeps  out  the  cold  wind, 
and  in  summer  the  reflected  heat  and  glare, 
thus  preserving  inside  an  equal  tempera- 
ture. 

I  next  went  to  visit  my  relatives,  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  J.  Colquhoun,  up  the  Grand  River,  with  its 
beautiful  banks,  to  Berlin  (originally  a  German 
settlement),  where  everything  is  rapidly  im- 
proving, with  a  rail  going  through  the  settle- 
ment. There  is  little  crime  in  these  parts, 
for  when  I  visited  the  new  Court-house  and 
jail,  I  only  found  one  prisoner  in  the  latter, 
a  horse  thief.  When  Germans  quarrel,  they 
take  out  a  knife  and  score  one  another; 
but  they  are  generally  quiet,  kind  and 
peaceable. 

I  was  pleased  with  the  style  of  farming  about 
here,  the  huge  wooden  "  bank  barns"  100  feet 
long,  placed  against  a  bank,  costing  from  800 
to  1000  dollars,  and  containing  besides  the  corn 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  2?1 

and  hay,  the  horses  and  cattle,  well  arranged  for 
feeding  "  by  the  head."  It  was  quite  a  picture 
to  see  the  farmers'  daughters,  not  sitting  on 
piano  stools,  but  along  side  of  the  cows  in  the 
evening,  milking,  and  neatly  dressed,  after  the 
fashion  of  their  old  country,  in  stuff  gowns  with 
pink  trimming  round  the  bottom  of  the  short 
skirts,  and  red  handkerchiefs  on  their  heads. 
They  were  fresh  and  clean,  and  in  good  case, 
and  would  no  doubt  make  thrifty  partners  for 
country  folks. 

Bidding  adieu  to  that  land  of  great  promise, 
Canada  West,  I  went  from  Hamilton  by  steamer, 
and  encountered  an  equinoxial  storm  on  Lake 
Ontario,  accompanied  with  thunder,  lightening 
and  hail ;  the  Arabian  steamer  rolled  and  pitched 
terribly,  and  alarmed  both  male  and  female 
passengers,  some  prayed,  and  others  sang  hymns. 
We  reached  Kingston  in  safety,  and  then  sped 
down  the  rapids  of  the  St.  Lawrence  "  like  a 
hurricane"  with  the  west  wind  blowing  strong 
behind  us.

of  the  war.  It  took  very  few  days  to  pack,  to 
take  leave  of  valued  friends,  and  to  quit 
America,  probably  for  the  last  time,  and  to 
undertake  the  tenth  voyage  across  the  Atlantic. 
The  weather  was  clear  and  cold  as  we  journeyed 
by  Burlington  to  Boston,  thence  shipped 
in  the  Canada  steamer  for  Liverpool.  The 
sturdy  pilot  in  beard  and  moustache  stood  on 
the  clean  deck,  the  weather  was  bright,  and  a 
chilly  N.W.  wind  blowing  as  we  glided  out  of 
the  harbour.  We  left  a  snowy  track  behind  us 
in  the  black  waves  with  their  white  crests ;  gulls, 
following  after,  dipped  their  wings  in  the  brine. 
Though  I  had  left,  I  believe,  many  friends  in  the 
land  of  the  West,  I  felt  exhilirated  under  the 
influences  around  me,  and  what  was  in  prospect. 
Nothing  could  have  induced  me  to  go  back,  or 
to  step  into  the  clipper  schooner  with  its  white 
cotton  sails  which  conveyed  Mr.  Going,  the 
pilot,  ashore. 

Our  fifty  passengers  remained  very  quiet 
for  a  time,  till  they  had  become  accustomed 
to  the  motion  of  the  vessel,  and  then  their 
peculiarities  became  apparent.  One,  a  French- 
man, was  a  first-rate  pistol  shot,  could  drive

We  had  a  strong  abolitionist  of  slavery  on 
board,  and  there  were  very  hot  arguments  about 
"  the  domestic  institution."  Among  other 
anecdotes  he  gave  of  his  experience  of  slavery 
was  this  :  "  I  lived,  he  said,  "  on  one  occasion  a 
week  with  a  planter ;  he  was  a  careless  sort  of 
a  man,  and  left  the  charge  of  the  house  and 
everything  in  it,  to  his  coloured  housekeeper, 
a  bustling  woman  fifty  years  of  age,  whom  he 
used  to  consult,  and  called  always  '  Aunty 
Kitty.'  We  had  many  arguments  about  slavery, 
and  the  last  morning  I  was  with  him  he  said, 
'  We  don't  want  any  slavery  here,  it's  a  bad 
thing ;  we  would  free  our  slaves  if  we  got  the 
money  for  them.  Aunty  Kitty,  what  is  there 
for  dinner  ?' 

"  '  Don't  Aunty  Kitty  me,  you  brute,'  cried 
the  housekeeper,  '  you  talk  abolition  before  the 
stranger,  but  you  didn't  tell  him  you  sold  my 
daughter  to  a  nigger  driver,  and  she  has  gone 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  275 

south.'  The  planter  hung  down  his  head 
and  said  nothing.  I  enquired  privately  the 
particulars  of  this  affair.  The  housekeeper 
said,  it  was  quite  true  that  her  daughter 
had  been  sold,  she  was  nineteen,  and  a  pretty 
girl." 

If  a  man  has  slaves  left  him,  what  can 
he  do  ?  he  cannot  sell  them  at  once,  and  so 
starve  himself  and  family,  but  he  can  always 
improve  the  negro  and  prepare  him,  by 
careful  teaching,  for  eventual  emancipation, 
and  that  event  might  not  be  distant,  if  the 
northern  people  would  help  with  their  money, 
as  Britain  did  with  her  millions,  to  free 
the  slaves.  Yet,  too  hurriedly  did  emancipa- 
tion take  place  with  us,  for  the  good  of 
either  white  proprietor  or  black  slave,  as  I 
had  occasion  to  notice  in  a  progress  through 
the  West  Indies  years  ago,  and  also  saw  the 
effects  of  sudden  emancipation  of  slaves  at  the 
Cape  of  Good  Hope,  in  causing  the  emigration 
of  the  Dutch  Boers  in  thousands  with  their 
slaves.

home  and  friends;  and  as  we  turned  south 
again,  we  could  not  help  repeating  these  old 
lines :

But  it  was  some  weeks  before  H.M.  Transport

In  the  meantime,  the  Emperor  and  Empress  of 
the  French  arrived  in  England,  and  left  in  the 
midst  of  great  enthusiasm.  This  was  the  event 
in  the  spring  of  1855.  At  last,  I  was  ordered 
to  Cork,  and  found  28  officers  and  750  men 
of  the  3rd,  9th,  14th,  39th,  and  89th  regi- 
ments ready  to  embark,  in  the  stout  and

Cork  division,  was  quite  in  his  element  in 
preparing  the  troops  for  embarkation,  and 
seeing  them  placed  on  board.  He  was  con- 
stantly at  work,  in  or  out  of  his  office, 
and  rendered  most  valuable  service  during 
the  war,  at  a  very  important  point  of  de- 
parture. 

There  was  a  delay  of  some  days  at  Cork,  and 
after  the  morning's  work  was  over,  I  had  great 
satisfaction  in  viewing  the  environs  under  the 
kind  pilotage  of  the  Messrs.  Jennings,  seeing 
Ballincolig  Castle,  and  Kilrea  Abbey  and  Castle, 
ancient  upright  stones,  commemorative  of  the 
fall  of  chiefs  in  battle,  Raths  and  inscribed 
Ogham  stones.  I  had  formerly  visited  Blarney 
Castle,  and  kissed  the  stone  which  possesses 
such  a  power  of  "  sootherin,"  and  1  listened 
with  pleasure  to  the  bells  of  Shandon,  and 
entering  into  the  spirit  of  these  touching 
lines :

The  young  soldiers  who  were  scrambled  up 
and  sent  to  the  war,  were  necessarily  imperfectly 
drilled  and  disciplined  for  want  of  time  to  do 
this,  the  best  was  done  that  was  possible  with 
them  under  the  circumstances. 

A  set  of  villains  got  hold  of  them  sometimes 
in  Cork,  who  "  hocussed "  them  in  public 
houses,  and  when  they  were  asleep  stole  their 
ammunition-boots,  and  thus  many  came  into 
barracks  of  a  morning  with  bare  feet. 

One  day  the  General  gave  them  a  lec- 
ture and  threatened  to  confine  them  to 
barracks,  when  suddenly  a  large  number 


THE    LIFE    OF    A    SOLDIER.  279 

took  a  start  from  the  ranks,  and  jumping 
the  barrack  wall  disappeared,  they  were 
brought  back,  or  came  back  by  degrees 
when  their  money  was  gone,  and  they  had 
"  had  their  fling." 

At  length,  the  "  Saldanha"  arrived  from 
Liverpool.  I  went  down  to  the  ship  at  Queen's 
Town  to  make  arrangements  with  five  officers, 
one  hundred  and  fifty  men  and  the  baggage, 
returned  and  mustered  the  remainder  of  my 
charge  at  an  early  hour  next  day  on  parade ;  it 
is  dangerous  for  soldiers  to  take  leave  of  an 
afternoon  to  the  tune  of  the  "  Girl  we  left 
behind  us."  I  was  pleased  to  march  the 
remaining  six  hundred  young  fellows  out  of 
the  barrack  square  all  "  sober  and  alert," 
followed  by  a  crowd  of  women,  the  men 
cheering,  the  band  of  the  2nd  Somerset 
militia  playing  us  down  the  hill,  and  an  Irish 
boy  saluting  me  at  parting  with  "  God 
speed  ye,  Sir !" 

I  thought — of  all  these  boys,  officers  and 
men,  rejoicing  in  their  youth,  who  will  return  ? 
perhaps  half  according  to  the  rate  of  the 
casualties  hitherto  in  the  Russian  war.  We

went  down  the  river  in  two  steam  boats  to  the 
ship.  I  watched  closely  for  drink,  but  saw 
none,  however  to  my  great  annoyance  out  of 
the  hold  of  the  other  steamer  many  men  rolled 
up  drunk,  and  it  was  difficult  to  get  them  over 
the  side  of  the  "  Saldanha,"  with  their  packs 
and  muskets  handed  up.  On  investigating 
this,  I  found  that  certain  old  women  had  stowed 
themselves  in  the  second  steamer,  and  sold  milk 
"laced"  with  whiskey,  "an  iron  hand  in  a 
velvet  glove"  to  knock  a  man  down,  hence 
the  mischief,  and  how  the  old  women  "  done'* 
me. 

But  all  were  shaken  into  their  places  as  soon 
as  possible,  and  every  one  was  searched  for 
lucifer  matches,  and  those  that  were  found  were 
thrown  overboard.  The  men  were  berthed, 
divided  into  messes,  arms  placed  in  the  racks, 
chakos  over  them,  the  pouches  with  ammuni- 
tion were  stowed  away  in  barrels  in  the  ship's 
magazine  out  of  the  way  of  danger,  and  a  few 
pouches  left  out  for  an  emergency ;  best  clothes 
were  put  away,  and  old  ones  looked  out  for  the 
voyage. 

The  "Saldanha"  of  1563  tons,  and  60  men 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  281 

of  a  ship's  company,  was  too  crowded  with  28 
army  officers  and  750  soldiers  besides — 838 
souls  in  all.  We  had  150  too  many  for 
comfort;  there  were  standing  bed  places  for 
350  sick  from  the  Crimea,  but  we  could  not 
swing  hammocks  conveniently  for  the  additional 
numbers  going  to  the  seat  of  war ;  however  we 
tried  to  make  the  best  of  it,  though  it  was 
difficult  to  keep  the  ship  as  clean  as  we  wished, 
and  tried  to  do,  with  such  a  crowd.  A  good 
mess  was  established  for  the  officers,  it  cost, 
with  a  pint  of  wine,  beer,  and  a  glass  of  grog  at 
night,  3s.  6d.  each ;  the  ship  was  well  found  in 
provisions  for  the  men.  I  wish  it  were  the 
custom  in .  the  service  to  give  no  grog  on 
embarking,  only  tea,  coffee  or  cocoa, — beer 
might  be  allowed,  if  it  were  not  too  expensive  and 
did  not  take  up  too  much  room.  In  a  week  and 
after  a  bout  of  sea  sickness,  men  would  not  miss 
spirits,  if  they  got  two  or  three  times  a  day 
something  warm  to  comfort  them,  exhilirating 
but  not  intoxicating.  I  tested  this  system  twice 
exploring,  and  proved  its  advantage  with  men 
accustomed  to  daily  spirits, — without  spirits, 
after  a  month,  they  would  feel  so  much  better,

that  many  might  leave  off  their  use  ever  after. 
The  human  body  cannot  be  healthy  or  well 
prepared  for  wounds  with  daily  drams,  the 
finest  muscle  loses  its  power,  more  or  less, 
under  alcoholic  influence ;  a  man's  temper  is 
generally  better  without  than  with  spirit 
drinking. 

At  this  time  of  writing,  St.  Patrick's  Day,  T 
see  men  and  women,  boys  and  girls  staggering 
out  of  town,  the  worse  for  liquor,  that  infernal 
whiskey,  and  which  is  seldom  tempered  with 
water  by  the  working  classes  ;  many  youths  will 
date  their  ruin  from  this  day. 

We  sailed  with  a  favouring  breeze,  the 
soldiers  in  the  castles,  at  the  mouth  of  the  river, 
turning  out  and  saluting  us  with  bugles  which 
we  replied  to.  In  the  evening  we  saw  the  old 
head  of  Kinsale. 

Next  day,  I  observed  the  decks  unaccountably 
wet  after  breakfast,  and  I  found  the  men  had 
thrown  about  their  cocoa,  and  had  not  drank  it. 
I  enquired  the  reason  of  this,  "  they  did  not 
like  it,  they  were  not  used  to  it — it  was  like 
dirty  water,"  I  was  obliged  to  harangue  them 
by  detachments,  from  the  top  of  a  hen  coop, 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  283 

explained  to  them  that  they  had  the  best  of 
food  on  board,  that  they  must  get  accustomed 
to  the  cocoa,  and  that  they  would  be  glad  of  it 
after  a  week  on  service  ashore ;  that  every  justice 
would  be  done  them  by  their  officers,  and 
though  we  were  crowded,  yet  all  must  en- 
deavour to  be  contented  and  to  be  pleasant 
to  one  another.  With  more  &lt;:  sweetening" 
to  their  cocoa,  they  took  to  it,  and  all  went 
on  well. 

After  they  had  got  over  their  sea  sickness, 
they  were  marched  and  trotted  round  the  decks 
with  a  drum  and  fife  for  exercise.  We  had 
foils,  boxing-gloves  and  single  sticks,  sea  quoits 
and  shuffle-board  for  the  officers.  All  our 
books  were  thrown  together  to  form  a  library  for 
the  officers ;  there  was  also  a  stock  of  books  and 
tracts  for  the  men's  reading  during  the  day, 
and  a  fiddle  in  the  evening  for  dancing.  We 
had  much  singing,  and  a  couple  of  conjurors 
frequently  exhibited  their  skill ;  one  of  them 
had  an  egg  bag  with  him,  and  other  apparatus 
of  the  black  art.  We  had  variety  enough  on 
week  days,  and  on  Sundays  the  religious 
duties  were  devoutly  attended  to,  the  Presby-

terians  singing  their  psalm  tunes  with  great 
fervour.  The  officers  were  gentlemen,  and 
an  excellent  Adjutant  was  found  in  Lieutenant 
Terry  of  the  9th  Regiment. 

A  "  stout  party  "  on  board  was  accused  of 
pretending  illness  to  avoid  his  turn  of  watch. 
Perhaps  he  was  of  that  great  family,  one  of  whom 
said  of  himself : — 

"  I've  ne'er  had  a  ganius  for  work 
It  is  not  in  the  blood  of  the  Bradys 
But  I'd  make  a  most  elegant  Turk, 
Being  fond  of  tobacco  and  ladies." 

It  was  said  of  the  above  worthy,  '  Why  is  he 
like  England  ? '  '  Because  he  expects  every  man 
to  do  his  duty.' 

Warned  by  long  experience  of  sea  voyaging, 
and  by  the  late  fearful  example  of  the '  Europa ' 
transport,  which  took  fire,  it  was  supposed,  from 
a  lucifer  match,  and  the  destruction  of  which 
was  fatal  to  Colonel  Moore  of  the  dragoon 
guards,  several  non-commissioned  officers  and 
men,  and  all  the  horses  of  the  detachment  on 
board — as  soon  as  our  people  had  got  their 
sea  legs,  a  fire  parade  was  arranged,  crews 
were  told  off  to  the  boats,  the  boatswain 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  285 

and  his  mates  were  appointed  to  the  charge 
of  the  fire  engine,  hose  and  water  tubs.  Bayonet 
sentries  were  placed,  under  the  orderly  officer, 
along  the  upper  deck  to  preserve  order,  enable 
water  to  be  passed,  and  prevent  a  rush  to  the 
boats ;  the  rest  of  the  soldiers  were  below 
under  their  officers,  and  ready  to  pass  water, 
or  be  otherwise  employed.  The  Captain  of 
the  ship,  of  course,  had  the  command  on  his 
own  quarter-deck.  The  fire  bell  was  rung,  and 
we  went  through  the  form  of  extinguishing  a 
fire  in  the  fore-castle. 

I  think  this  matter,  though  we  had  no  orders 
for  it,  is  of  the  greatest  importance,  viz :  a  fire 
parade  in  troop  ships,  it  prevents  hurry  and  con- 
fusion on  the  occasion  of  a  fire,  and  it  should  be 
practised  as  soon  as  practicable  after  leaving  the 
harbour. 

The  fifth  day  after  leaving  Cork,  we  sighted 
the  high  mountains  on  the  coast  of  Spain,  with 
their  varied  outline,  and  the  extensive  buildings 
of  Cadiz  in  the  distance ;  far  out  at  sea  black 
and  high  prowed  boats  were  pulling  over  the 
waves  as  if  going  to  fishing  grounds,  then  a 
mountain  near  Trafalgar  appeared,  with  beautiful 


286  PASSAGES   IN 

effects  of  light  and  shade  on  its  bare  top  and 
grassy  sides  ;  next  the  red  andyellow  flag  of  Spain 
waved  over  the  castle  and  towers  of  Tarifa,  remark- 
able in  the  Peninsular  War  for  its  siege  and  stout 
defence.  The  coast  of  Africa  now  rose  before  us, 
the  rugged  Apes'  hill,  backed  by  the  giant  Mount 
Atlas,  its  flanks  loaded  with  snow.  Our  enthu- 
siasm was  roused  as  we  passed  through  the 
pillars  of  Hercules  into  the  Mediterranean  Sea, 
"  deeply,  darkly,  beautifully  blue  ; "  and  on 
our  left,  Gibraltar's  high  promontory,  its 
fawn-coloured  town  clearly  seen,  and  two 
hundred  ships  detained  at  anchor  by  the 
west  wind. 

"  This  is  beautiful  yacht  sailing,"  said  one. 

"  But  have  you  secured  a  return  ticket  from 
Sebastopol  ?  "  asked  another  voyager. 

"  Well  we  must  '  put  our  trust  in  Providence, 
and  keep  our  powder  dry,'  that's  all  we  can  do." 

We  passed  the  magnificent  ridges  of  Sierra 
Nevada  in  Spain,  then  Galita  and  the  Serti 
Rocks,  where  Her  Majesty's  ship  "  Avenger," 
Captain  Napier  commanding,  was  lost.  The 
"  Avenger  "  was  one  of  two  steamers  which  left 
Gibraltar  in  1847,  they  raced  in  a  gale  of  wind. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  287 

One  went  north,  the  "Avenger"  south  of 
Galita,  and  thus  she  smashed  on  the  Sertis. 
Lieut.  Rooke  was  saved  by  a  miracle  almost,  he 
was  in  his  cot  after  his  watch,  ran  on  deck  when 
the  vessel  struck,  and  got  off  in  a  boat  with  the 
carpenter  and  a  boy,  all  the  rest  were  drowned ; 
but  the  Lieutenant  never  got  over  the  shock,  he 
died  sometime  after,  and  the  carpenter  and  the 
boy  went  to  sea  again,  and  have  never  been 
heard  of. 

We  passed  Cape  Guardant,  Bay  of  Tunis. 
Twelve  miles  from  Tunis  are  the  ruins  of  Car- 
thage, they  are  now  about  three  miles  from  the 
sea,  an  aqueduct  remains  "  to  point  the  moral' 
of  its  fall,  of  Carthage  which  ruled  three  hundred 
African  cities. 

Next  was  Cape  Bon  and  the  fine  Neapolitan 
island,  thirty  miles  in  circuit,  of  Patalaria ;  a 
volcano  is  four  miles  inland,  and  a  lake  in  the 
crater  with  sides  rising  a  hundred  feet  above  the 
water,  which  is  unfathomable.  Patalaria  has 
craggy  ridges,  is  well  cultivated,  producing 
figs,  olives,  cotton,  vegetables,  &amp;c.,  —  many 
white  houses  appeared  among  the  fields. 
There  are  four  thousand  five  hundred  souls

on  it,  and  some  of  the  Neapolitan  nobles  are 
banished  there,  they  might  be  in  a  much 
worse  place,  "  apperiently,"  according  to  the 
pronunciation  of  an  Hospital  Sergeant.  '  How's 
that  man  to  day,  Sergeant  ?'  '  He  is  apperiently 
better,  Sir/ 

We  were  not  far  off  the  place  where  Graham's 
Island,  a  mile  round,  rose  from  the  wave  to  a 
height  of  one  hundred  and  eighty  feet,  had  the 
British  flag  hoisted  on- it  in  1831,  and  sank 
again  in  1832! 

After  a  splendid  run  of  thirteen  days,  we 
sighted  Malta,  and  at  night,  as  we  rounded  in 
by  the  south  coast,  it  was  exciting  to  see  the 
planet  Jupiter  shining  over  the  lighthouse  of 
the  Castle  of  St.  Elmo,  as  our  guiding  star. 
We  sent  up  signal  rockets,  a  pilot  came  on 
board,  the  anchor  plunged  into  the  water  of  the 
harbour,  and  we  were  soon  on  shore  and  climbing 
the  steep  streets  of  Valetta  to  the  Strada  Reale. 
I  paid  my  respects  to  the  General,  Sir  James 
Ferguson,  visited  a  relative  Miss  Mayne, 
well  known  and  much  esteemed  in  society 
at  Malta,  and  then  returned  on  board,  pre- 
vious to  a  hot  day's  work,  which  consisted 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  289 

in  disembarking  some  of  the  detachments, 
and  taking  on  board  others  as  "food  for 
powder." 

There  was  a  delay  of  two  or  three  days  at 
Malta,  till  all  was  ready  for  the  continuance  of  the 
voyage,  and  I  took  the  opportunity  to  see  as 
much  of  this  remarkable  island  as  possible  ;  the 
church  of  St.  John,  the  Palace  of  the  Grand 
Masters  with  their  portraits,  and  a  curious 
Armoury,  containing  old  swords  and  firelocks, 
suits  of  armour — some  of  which  were  dented 
with  balls,  about  the  time  when  it  began 
to  be  disused  ;  light  and  handy  scymetars  of 
the  Turks,  of  the  period,  when  they  took, 
after  desperate  fighting,  the  Castle  of  St. 
Elmo  ;  the  black  armour  of  a  Spanish 
giant,  &amp;c. 

The  view  over  the  harbour  from  the  Bar- 
racca  was  not  omitted,  and  an  inspection  was 
made  of  some  of  the  magnificent  auberges, 
of  the  different  languages  of  the  Knights 
of  St.  John.  Then  at  an  early  hour  in 
the  morning,  off  in  a  caliche,  with  Captain 
J.  Lewis  of  the  Buffs  (my  new  Adjutant), 
to  Citta  Vechia,  in  the  middle  of  the  island.

The  treeless  country  at  Malta  is  not  very 
attractive  to  a  stranger,  driving  between  stone 
walls  and  along  a  dusty  road,  yet  one  cannot 
help  admiring  the  industry  of  the  inhabitants 
in  the  cultivation  of  their  fields,  and  off 
the  hard  rock  by  forced  soil  and  manure, 
producing  the  crops  they  do.  The  well- 
watered  garden  at  St.  Antonio,  the  sum- 
mer residence  of  the  Governor,  Sir  William 
Reid,  K.C.B.  with  its  trees,  flowers  and 
walks  was  inviting  as  a  half-way  house. 

The  cactus  plants,  and  a  palm  or  two  by  the 
road  side,  waving  their  fringed  leaves  in  the 
air,  indicated  that  we  had  got  to  the  land  of  the 
sun.  At  the  old  capital,  we  saw  the  church 
and  grotto  of  St.  Paul,  in  the  latter  a  statue  of 
the  earnest  servant  of  God.  A  priest,  for  a 
honorarium,  conducted  us,  with  a  boy  carrying  a 
light,  through  the  catacombs  there.  Above 
ground  we  were  assailed,  as  is  usual  here,  with 
old  women  extending  the  hand  and  whining 
out,  with  their  head  on  one  side,  "  Miserabile ! 
Miserabile  !" 

Malta  in  winter,  that  is  for  seven  months  of 
the  year  is  very  well,  but  the  other  five  months 


THE   LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  291 

are  killing.  I  have  seen  the  three  doctors  of  a 
regiment  ill  at  once  there,  and  all  the  officers 
very  piano  from  the  heat,  and  on  the  sick  list 
constantly.  Singular  that  at  Malta  it  has  not 
been  the  custom  to  wear  white  cap  covers  as  in 
India.  I  have  a  wholesome  respect  for  an 
eastern  sun,  and  know  well  its  power  on  an 
European  head. 

I  was  in  the  Opera  House  at  Valetta,  but  it 
was  hot  work,  one  advantage  it  has  for  the 
British  frequenter  of  it  is,  that  it  helps  to  the  ac- 
quisition of  Italian.  Many  professors  of  the 
language  are  to  be  found  at  Malta  for  the 
seeking,  and  willing  to  impart  their  knowledge 
at  a  reasonable  rate.  One  card  I  got,  surmoun- 
ted with  the  Royal  Arms,  was  comprehensive 
enough  and  ran  thus  :  "  The  Rev.  J.  Florian 
teaches  the  French,  Italian,  and  Latin  languages, 
the  piano-forte  and  the  guitar ;  he  takes  daguer- 
reotype likenesses ;  prints  on  brass  or  lithographic 
stone,  guilds  and  plates,  bronzes,  washes  and 
cleans  gold,  makes  busts  of  different  colours,  on 
forms,  black,  blue,  and  red  ink,  copies  music, 
makes  mirrors,  &amp;c.»

Representing  to  the  authorities  at  Malta,  that 
we  were  over-crowded  by  1 50  men,  I  got  that 
number  less,  and  we  breathed  freely  with  600 
soldiers  on  board, — we  left  Malta  towed  by  the 
"  Cambria,"  a  powerful  steamer,  and  stood  away 
towards  the  Isles  of  Greece.  At  the  Horse 
Guards,  I  was  told  I  had  to  stay  at  Malta 
six  weeks  and  drill  a  battalion,  but  I  was 
ordered  on  at  once,  I  never  asked  the  reason 
of  the  change,  but  I  was  afterwards  very 
glad  of  it. 

For  the  benefit  of  the  new  detachments,  I 
gave  directions  for  another  fire  parade.  Some 
of  the  officers  seemed  to  think  it  unnecessary,  as 
our  voyage  might  be  a  short  one,  however,  we 
had  the  parade,  and  half  an  hour  after  it  was 
over,  and  whilst  the  men  were  at  dinner,  the 
orderly  officer  ran  down  to  where  I  was  reading 
in  the  cabin,  and  said,  "  Sir,  there's  a  fire  in  the 
ship !"  I  could  hardly  believe  him  at  first, 
however,  on  going  forward  I  found  the  main 
deck  full  of  smoke,  and  that  there  really  was  a 
bad  fire. 

It  appeared  that  the  baker,  a  landsman, 
had  left  the  ash-tray  out  in  his  bakery,  and 


THE    LIFE    OF   A   SOLDIER.  293 

the  live  cinders  dropping  on  the  deck  had 
burnt  through  it  in  his  absence,  and  the 
sergeants  messing  below  were  half  choked  with 
smoke. 

The  fire  bell  was  immediately  rung,  all  knew 
and  took  their  places,  the  engine  was  rigged 
and  brought  into  play.  Lieutenant  Hawkey, 
and  Dr.  Bews,  staff-surgeon,  were  particularly 
active  with  wet  blankets,  the  deck  was  broken 
into  through  the  bull's  eyes,  the  burning 
wood  deluged  with  water,  and  after  half  an 
hour's  hard  work  all  danger  was  over.  This 
was  a  practical  illustration  of  the  use  of  fire 
parades. 

We  had  two  young  doctors  on  board,  who 
were  full  of  zeal  and  anxious  for  cases;  at 
dinner  a  report  was  brought  to  the  youngest 
of  them  that  a  female  was  unwell,  and  near 
her  confinement,  he  bustled  about  and  got 
what  he  thought  was  requisite  for  the  emer- 
gency, but  returned  to  table  much  discon- 
certed, and  sat  down  amidst  great  laughter, 
when  the  interesting  case  turned  out  to  be  that 
of  a  sheep. 

We  reached  the  rocky  coast  of  the  Morea, 


294  PASSAGES    IN  . 

and  passed  between  Cape  Matapan  and  the 
Island  of  Cerigo ;  opposite  the  Gulf  of  Athens 
appeared  the  bare  heights  of  Zoea, — then  Cape 
Colonna,  with  the  pillars  plainly  seen  of  a 
ruined  temple  of  Minerva,  excited  the  greatest 
interest  as  the  scene  also  of  Falconer's  "  Ship- 
wreck." Next  was  the  considerable  Island  of 
Andros  with  its  white  town  and  vessels  of 
quaint  rig  stealing  out  of  the  harbour ;  presently 
the  interest  was  changed  to  the  shores  of 
Asia  Minor,  to  the  site  of  Troy,  to  Mount 
Ida  5,700  feet  high,  to  Tenedos,  behind 
which  the  Greeks  hid  their  vessels  after  the 
stratagem  of  the  wooden  horse  was  success- 
fully practised. 

We  entered  the  Dardenelles  between  the 
castles  of  Europe  and  Asia.  The  field  of 
Marathon  was  not  far  oif,  and  we  were  in 
the  midst  of  scenes  of  the  highest  interest  in 
history.  The  walls  of  the  fortresses  com- 
manding the  strait  were  deeply  marked  by  the 
hand  of  time.  We  observed  where  Byron 
swam  from  Sestos  to  Abydos,  a  French 
three  decker  was  passing  up  there,  towed  by 
two  steamers,  then  came  the  "  Montezuma" 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  295 

towing  a  frigate  full  of  French  soldiers  at 
the  entrance  of  the  Sea  of  Marmora,  its  islands 
famous  for  marble  quarries. 

We  kept  Her  Majesty's  birthday  on  board, 
fired  the  ship's  guns,  three  volleys  of  musketry, 
and  hoisted  all  the  colours,  and  soon  after 
saw  the  "  Seven  Towers"  of  Constantinople 
the  Magnificent,  and  brought  up  amidst  a 
fleet  of  ships  opposite  the  Golden  Horn, 
on  which  looked  down  mosques  and  mina- 
rets, the  walls  of  the  Seraglio  and  vast 
piles  of  building  relieved  by  the  fresh  green 
of  the  interspersed  trees,  —  a  glorious  pano- 
rama. 

We  landed  first  at  Scutari,  and  Major  Sillery, 
commandant  there,  was  so  good  as  walk  round 
the  great  hospital  with  me,  and  showed  me  the 
arrangements  which  seemed  perfect.  The  wards

men  in  bed,  and  officers  moving  about 
on  crutches,  told  the  tale  of  war  not  far 
distant. 

Rowing  towards  Seraglio  Point,  a  broad  shoot 
or  slide  of  wood  is  seen  commencing  from  a 
door  in  the  upper  part  of  the  garden  wall,  and 
terminating  in  water  running  rapidly  past 
below.  Strange  stories  are  told  of  this  slide ; 
apparently  it  is  for  shooting  garden  rubbish 
into  the  Bosphorus,  but  it  is  said  that  it  has 
been  employed  also  to  get  rid  of  faithless  ladies, 
who,  brought  in  sacks  to  the  fatal  door,  were 
hurried  down  the  descent,  and  disappeared 
beneath  the  wave.  That  cries  of  distress  have 
been  heard  at  night  by  men-of-war  anchored 
near,  armed  boats  put  off  to  assist,  nothing 
seen  at  the  time,  but  next  day  another  ship 
coming  in,  turning  up  with  its  prow  sacks  with 
beautiful  females  in  them,  so  it  is  related. 

The  streets  of  Pera  and  Galata  were  crowded 
as  usual  with  men  and  women,  Oriental  and 
European  costume  mixed  up  with  many  red 
breeched  French  soldiers.  The  barracks  of  the 
French  were  on  the  Constantinople  side  of  the 
Bosphorus.  I  went  off  in  a  light  caique  to 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  297 

visit  the  new  and  splendid  palace  nearly 
finished,  of  the  Sultan,  at  Dolma  Bagche, 
and  fell  in  with  a  pugnacious  French  priest 
there ;  we  were  refused  admittance  at  the  first 
door  at  which  we  presented  ourselves,  which 
roused  the  ire  of  my  friend,  "  we  must  get  in 
here,"  he  cried. 

"How?"  I  asked. 

"  Draw  your  sword  and  go  in  as  our  officers 
do!" 

"  That  won't  do  with  us,"  I  said,  "let  us  try 
another  door." 

We  did  so,  and  saw  workmen  employed  on 
the  beautiful  blue,  white  and  golden  walls  of  a 
magnificent  hall.  A  handsome  mosque  was 
near,  I  proposed  to  go  and  see  it ;  we  were 
stopped  at  the  door  as  I  expected,  and  a  man 
pointed  at  our  boots. 

"  Draw  your  sword !"  again  said  the  priest. 

"  No,  no,"  I  said,  "  pull  off  your  shoes  if 
you  want  to  see  the  inside,"  and  he  was 
reluctantly  obliged  to  do  so. 

It  is  only  right  and  proper,  and  no  hardship, 
to  comply  with  this  custom,  as  there  are  mats 
to  walk  on  in  the  mosques,  and  though

this  priest  said  so,  I  do  not  believe  the 
French  officers  forced  their  way  in  Turkey, 
sword  in  hand,  into  places  to  which  access  was 
refused. 

I  paid  my  respects  to  Rear-Admiral  the 
Honourable  Sir  Frederick  Grey,  K.C.B.  in 
command  at  Constantinople,  and  then  went  to 
see  what  was  not  thought  of,  when  I  was  last  in 
these  regions,  the  opera.  I  heard  some  "  loud" 
performance  there,  but  the  smell  of  the  place, 
and  the  dust  on  the  floor  were  not  agreeable, 
though  I  can  put  up  with  a  good  deal  of 
miser e ;  the  charge  for  the  boxes  was  about 
four  shillings, 

We  now  got  bales  of  summer  clothing  for 
the  men,  consisting  of  a  drab  tunic  and  trowsers 
like  sacking,  and  made  at  Trieste  by  contract. 
The  bales  were  said  to  contain  300  suits  each? 
and  1  was  asked  to  sign  for  a  certain  number  of 
bales.  I  declined  till  a  bale  was  opened  and 
counted ;  to  the  surprise  of  the  officer  appointed 
to  issue  this  clothing,  not  only  for  our  people 
on  board  the  Saldanha,  but  for  others  at  the 
seat  of  war,  one  hundred  suits  were  deficient  out 
of  three  hundred.  Here  was  wholesale  roguery. 


THE    LIFE    OF   A    SOLDIER.  299 

We  moved  up  the  Bosphorus  with  all  its 
beauties  of  natural  scenery,  and  cheerful  with 
oriental  architecture,  trees,  gardens,  and  fields. 
Transports  were  coming  down  with  sick  and 
wounded,  and  many  more  besides  ourselves  were 
pressing  onwards,  freighted  with  men  and  horses 
for  the  great  struggle  in  advance  of  us.  The 
Sardinians  were  with  us,  and  they  swarmed  like 
bees  on  the  British  steamers  in  which  they  were 
embarked,  crowded  on  the  decks  and  sitting 
along  the  hammock  nettings,  in  hundreds,  in 
their  grey-undress. 

The  contest  had  been  flagging  for  some 
months,  in  fact  since  the  bombardment  in 
October  nothing  very  important  had  occurred, 
now  however  it  was  commencing  again  in 
earnest,  from  all  we  saw  as  we  entered  the 
Black  Sea.  On  our  right  was  an  old  Castle, 
where  two  English  ladies,  incautiously  approach- 
ing to  sketch,  with  only  one  attendant,  had  lately 
made  a  narrow  escape  from  a  wild  garrison, 
some  of  which  tried  to  detain  them. 

Fogs  impeded  our  progress  across  the  Euxine, 
then  clearing  off,  we  saw  the  wild  and  rocky 
coasts  of  Grim  Tartary  before  us,  breasting  the

waves  with  high  cliffs  of  dark  red  and  ochre 
colour.  As  we  sailed  on,  two  beautiful  doves 
alighted  on  our  taffrail,  emblems  of  peace,  with 
burnished  wings  of  yellow  and  bronze.  We 
listened  for  the  sound  of  cannon  as  we  dropped 
our  anchor  outside  Balaklava  Harbour,  we  soon 
heard  the  solemn  boom  of  a  large  gun,  then 
others  at  intervals,  "the  deep  breath  of  the 
cannon's  mouth."  We  knew  then  that  we  were 
in  time,  that  the  great  siege  was  still  going  on, 
and  that  though  peace  might  be  expected  even- 
tually, yet  from  all  the  preparations  we  saw 
around  us  for  the  vigorous  prolongation  of  the 
contest,  scenes  of  great  excitement  and  interest 
must  ensue  before  we  could  expect  the  end  of 
the  Russian  War.
