The bridge was constructed by the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("39567",this,"canadian_pacific_railway.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("39567")' href="/topics/Canadian_Pacific_Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a><span class="hp" id="m39567"><div class="hpHeader">Canadian Pacific Railway</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i39567"></div>The Canadian Pacific Railway , formerly also known as CP Rail  between 1968 and 1996, is a historic Canadian Class I railway founded in 1881 and now operated by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001...</div><br></span>&nbsp;between 1898 and 1900. Four barges were built to move steel beams into position. During the winter (1899–1900) workmen toiled day and night chopping channels to keep the ice clear for the barges to pass so that work could continue on the superstructure. Considerable construction delays were caused by the severe winter conditions. By September 1900 the four fixed support spans were complete. The Canadian Society of Civil Engineers&nbsp;held its annual meeting in Ottawa in order that its members might tour the bridge works and see the preparations being made for placing the centre span. The bridge's main cantilever centre span was, at the time of construction, the longest in Canada and the fourth longest in the world. Both records are now held by the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("15509",this,"quebec_bridge.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("15509")' href="/topics/Quebec_Bridge">Quebec Bridge</a><span class="hp" id="m15509"><div class="hpHeader">Quebec Bridge</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i15509"></div>right|thumb|Lifting the centre span in place was considered to be a major engineering achievement.

The centre span was successfully put in place on October 7, and a locomotive made a trial run on December 12, 1900. On February 18, 1901 the bridge was officially inaugurated as the Interprovincial Bridge as it had been built by the Ottawa Interprovincial Bridge Company.

During the late 1950s the bridge was upgraded to carry vehicular&nbsp;and pedestrian traffic.  The closure of Ottawa Union Station&nbsp;in 1966 saw the last passenger trains use the Royal Alexandra Bridge and the railway tracks were removed as the bridge became exclusively a vehicular-pedestrian bridge.<br />

The park was known as a popular gay pick-up area, and six youths were also in the park searching for homosexuals to rob and attack. They saw Brosseau and followed him when he walked to the bridge, believing incorrectly that he was gay. A short way across Brosseau was first hit with a stick and then robbed. Gang member Jeffrey Lalonde then lifted Brosseau and threw him off the bridge. Brosseau was killed instantly when he hit the rocks below. Lalonde was given a life sentence, and died in jail in 2008.<br />
