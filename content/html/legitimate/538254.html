at 543,400. There have been 33,641 Americans killed by now, a total greater
than the Korean War.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">May 1969</FONT> - The <I>New York Times</I> breaks
the news of the secret bombing of Cambodia. As a result, Nixon orders FBI

men of the 101st Airborne die during a fierce ten-day battle at 'Hamburger
Hill' in the A Shau Valley near Hue. 400 others are wounded. After the
hill is taken, the troops are then ordered to abandon it by their commander.
NVA then move in and take back the hill unopposed.</P>

<P>The costly assault and its confused aftermath provokes a political outcry
back in the U.S. that American lives are being wasted in Vietnam. One Senator
labels the assault &quot;senseless and irresponsible.&quot;</P>

<P>It is the beginning of the end for America in Vietnam as Washington
now orders MACV&nbsp;Commander Gen. Creighton Abrams to avoid such encounters
in the future. 'Hamburger Hill' is the last major search and destroy mission
by U.S. troops during the war. Small unit actions will now be used instead.</P>

<P>A long period of decline in morale and discipline begins among American
draftees serving in Vietnam involuntarily. Drug usage becomes rampant as
nearly 50 percent experiment with marijuana, opium, or heroin which are
easy to obtain on the streets of Saigon. U.S. military hospitals later
become deluged with drug related cases as drug abuse causalities far outnumber
causalities of war.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">May 14, 1969</FONT> - During his first TV speech

portrait photos of all 242 Americans killed in Vietnam during the previous
week, including the 46 killed at 'Hamburger Hill.' The photos have a stunning
impact on Americans nationwide as they view the once smiling young faces
of the dead. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 1969 </FONT>- President Nixon, through a
French emissary, sends a secret letter to Ho Chi Minh urging him to settle
the war, while at the same time threatening to resume bombing if peace
talks remain stalled as of November 1. In August, Hanoi responds by repeating
earlier demands for Viet Cong participation in a coalition government in
South Vietnam.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 8, 1969</FONT> - The very first U.S. troop

is made public. It advocates U.S. military and economic assistance to nations
around the world struggling against Communism, but no more Vietnam-style
ground wars involving American troops. The emphasis is thus placed on local
military self-sufficiency, backed by U.S. air power and technical assistance
to assure security.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">July 30, 1969</FONT> - President Nixon visits
U.S. troops and President Thieu in Vietnam. This is Nixon's only trip to
Vietnam during his presidency.</P>

<P>Demonstration organizers had received praises from North Vietnam's Prime
Minister Pham Van Dong, who stated in a letter to them &quot;...may your
fall offensive succeed splendidly,&quot; marking the first time Hanoi publicly
acknowledged the American anti-war movement. Dong's comments infuriate
American conservatives including Vice President Spiro Agnew who lambastes
the protesters as Communist &quot;dupes&quot; comprised of &quot;an effete
corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals.&quot;</P>

<P>By year's end, America's fighting strength in Vietnam has been reduced
by 115,000 men. 40,024 Americans have now been killed in Vietnam. Over
the next few years, the South Vietnamese Army will be boosted to over 500,000

Nixon stuns Americans by announcing U.S. and South Vietnamese incursion
into Cambodia &quot;...not for the purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia
but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam and winning the just peace
we desire.&quot; The announcement generates a tidal wave of protest by
politicians, the press, students, professors, clergy members, business
leaders, and many average Americans against Nixon and the Vietnam War.</P>

<P>The incursion is in response to continuing Communist gains against Lon
Nol's forces and is also intended to weaken overall NVA military strength
as a prelude to U.S. departure from Vietnam.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">May 1, 1970</FONT> - May Day, the traditional
