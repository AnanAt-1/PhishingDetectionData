<H3>43rd Parliament</H3>
The Labor Party renominated Jenkins as Speaker in the 43rd Parliament, and he was elected unopposed when the Parliament opened on 28 September 2010.<br />
<br />

The resulting vote on suspending Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71-72. Convention would normally have required Jenkins to resign as Speaker, but the House of Representatives immediately thereafter approved a motion of confidence in the Speaker and he remained in the position.<br />
<br />
He resigned as the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 24 November 2011, stating: "My desire is to be able to participate in policy and parliamentary debate, and this would be incompatible with continuing in the role of Speaker".<br />
