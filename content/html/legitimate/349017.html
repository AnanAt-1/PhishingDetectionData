<p class="MsoNormal">Don't be taken in. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want to "fundamentally change" or destroy America now have 
control over most of the media, our large businesses, sports, and schools.&nbsp; 
The news is heavily biased, and we very seldom get an honest picture of what is 
happening. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations like the world economic forum use new words to influence our 
thinking.&nbsp; Instead of equality, they use words like "equity".&nbsp; Other 
words are "inclusion" and "diversity".&nbsp; There is a sinister purpose behind 
this language, it is to cloth their new ideology in such a way that it will be 
more acceptable to the general public and fool us into thinking that it Is all 
innocent.&nbsp; They are trying to force us to give up our decency and do away 
with merit.&nbsp; And they use force to silence those who disagree with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Those who won't use "woke" words are often fired.&nbsp; Students in classes 
and military personnel are required to call people by their "preferred" gender 
pronouns 
rather than by their biological gender, or they will be kicked out of class or 
kicked out of the army.&nbsp; The same is true in many "woke" corporations.&nbsp; 
It is not enough to scold people who refuse to use the language of the left, they are terminated.&nbsp; We are no longer supposed to work and study hard 
to achieve results based on effort, but to get equality of results. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical race theory was developed by a Marxist professor.&nbsp; One of 
his students was Obama.&nbsp; Marx himself wrote about critical theory.&nbsp;It 
is part of their strategy to destroy western culture. 
Children should be taught to accept others. The notion that all white 
children are inherently "racist" is more than harmful.&nbsp; It is evil. And we 
should not tolerate it in our schools.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are very easy to manipulate.&nbsp; If we train 
them to be homosexuals or transgenders, that is what they will be. We have a 
moral duty to train our little boys to grow up to be men, and our little girls 
to grow up to be women.&nbsp; We must fight back when the Democrats try to force 
us to give our children up to those who have serious problems with their 
sexuality.&nbsp; It is those people with problems who need to change, not us.&nbsp;And women's sports were developed for a reason, because men and women have 
innate differences.&nbsp; To force men into women's sports is evil.&nbsp; We 
should fight back, and not accept this perversity. <o:p>Part of the reason Tim 
Walz was chosen as the Democratic vice presidential candidate was that he signed 
a bill allowing the disfigurement of children who have not even reached the age 
of puberty.&nbsp; Children should not be cut up and castrated before they even 
reach puberty.&nbsp; We have to be morally sick to vote for such people.&nbsp; 
Children belong to their parents, not to the schools.&nbsp; We should not permit 
schools or doctors to make decisions for our children without contacting and 
getting approval from the parents.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the most unfair laws being passed are those 
that give reparations to black people.&nbsp; As is true of most people, my 
grandparents did not even come over to America until slavery was ended.&nbsp; 
All my life I have been for legal equaility for all races.&nbsp; More than1/2 
million Repulibans gave their lives to end slavery.&nbsp; The Democrats ran the 
South, and they are the ones who owned slaves, and they are the party that 
discriminated against blacks after slavery was ended.&nbsp; Yet the Democrats 
try to buy black votes with "reparations".&nbsp; Black&nbsp; people should not 
be taken in.&nbsp; Don't vote for the party of slavery and reparations, vote for 
the party of freedom and accountability for all.&nbsp; Everyone should have the 
right to work hard and succeed.&nbsp; No one should live off of the rest of us 
by selling their votes.&nbsp; And remember, when you sell your votes, the party 
you vote for ends up owning you.</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are being monitored when we browse the web, and the 
search engines are programmed so that we get the Democratic viewpoint first.&nbsp; 
We have to search diligently to get other viewpoints, though they are there, 
since all of the web is available to those who know the sites that they want.&nbsp; 
Those who listen to the "mainstream" media all day are indoctrinated, and have 
begun to believe the ideology that is behind it all.&nbsp; Google and Facebook 
have admitted that they have worked with the Democrats to doctor 
information before elections.&nbsp; And Zuckerberg has given millions of dollars 
to get out the vote, as have other millionaires.&nbsp; And getting out the vote 
usually means ballot harvesting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some states have ended the requirement to have an id to vote.&nbsp; This is also 
an attempt to get people to vote who are otherwise not eligible.&nbsp; Just a 
couple million illegal aliens who have been let into the country will be enough 
to win elections, unless a lot of us change our vote from democrat to republican 
this year.&nbsp; Biden is even giving illegals plane rides or bus rides into the 
country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald Trump is the perfect example of how the media 
works.&nbsp; They are constantly calling him a "liar".&nbsp; But it is them who 
are lying.&nbsp; Read the articles and books by Sharyl Attkisson to understand 
how we are being manipulated.&nbsp; Go to her website at
<a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/">https://sharylattkisson.com/</a>&nbsp; 
and to read of the many lies about Trump go to:<o:p><br />

https://sharylattkisson.com/2024/08/50-media-mistakes-in-the-trump-era-the-definitive-list/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Biden deliberately lies about trump.&nbsp; For example, while Trump has not 
condemned peaceful demonstrators, he has condemned the KKK many times.&nbsp; Yet 
Biden and the Democrat media knowingly repeat the lie that he believes many in 
the KKK are ok.&nbsp;Biden and the media constantly say that Trump lies.&nbsp; 
But if you 
research the so-called lies, like I have, you will find that they usually have 
distorted what he has said.<o:p>&nbsp; If you watched the debates carefully you 
could see how the moderators were deliberately working to support the Democrat 
candidate.&nbsp; They do not tell you any of the bad news about the Democrats, 
and they are constantly misstating what Trump or Vance say.&nbsp; Stop listening 
to them and get the news where you can read or hear what the candidates actually 
said, not the distorted misquotes that the press wants you to believe.<br />
</o:p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is only safe when the U.S. is strong and 
resolute.&nbsp; But it has gotten weak and controlled by the "woke".&nbsp; China 
now has a larger Navy than the US and they have been grooming our Democrat 
politicians. Biden and his son have gotten millions from them.&nbsp; China and a 
number of billionaires have been buying up the land in America.&nbsp; And China 
has been penetrating the south China seas. China is likely to take over Taiwan 
in the next few months, and then will be going after the Philippines.&nbsp; They 
took over Hong Kong and other free areas with nothing more than complaints from 
the West.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After winning the war in Vietnam, America simply 
pulled its troops out, and the south ran out of ammunition as the once defeated 
North came down south. After having defeated the Taliban in Afghanistan, we 
simply pulled out, leaving billions of dollars' worth of machines and ammunition 
to the Taliban.&nbsp; Girls are no longer allowed to go to school, and are 
again treated like second class citizens.&nbsp; If the U.S. stands by and lets 
the communist powers take over most of the world, eventually they will defeat us 
in battle too, if they they don't take us over from within.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hezbollah has bombed Isreal for 
many years, but when Isreal fought back and destroyed their bomb sites, Biden 
scolded them and withheld American aid. Biden and Harris want a two-state 
solution, one state full of hatred and wanting to exterminate Isreal. We should 
never allow a state to be controlled by hatred.&nbsp; We should use every 
opportunity to eliminate dictators who advocate hatred&nbsp; and help assure that 
all countries have republics where the people are free to think and to disagree.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biden has tossed out the American policy restricting 
Iran, so Iran has billions of dollars to supply Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis 
with ammunition to attack Isreal.&nbsp; Isreal cannot simply shoot down all of 
the missiles sent into it.&nbsp; It must destroy those who hate it and their 
missiles to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, because of Biden's allowing it, Iran is 
once again close to having a nuclear weapon. Having nuclear weapons in a country 
full of hatred means we will eventually have nuclear war.&nbsp; In fact, we 
should not be surprised if their agents bring some into America to destroy a 
few of our cities.&nbsp; Will&nbsp; it really take that to finally wake us up, 
and cause us to finally fight back?&nbsp; Iran should never be allowed to have 
nuclear weapons, and what they have developed should be destroyed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few people who got out of hand in Washington on January 
6<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Trump asked them to be peaceful, and to make sure it was peaceful he offered 
both Nancy Pelosi, and the mayor of Washinton D.C. additional troops to make 
sure everything was calm.&nbsp; But they turned him down, as Pelosi admitted.&nbsp; 
And as a consequence some people did cause problems.&nbsp; But to call it an insurrection is 
dishonest.&nbsp; Harris and others have donated money to help get people out of 
jail who detroyed significant parts of major cities, like Minneapolis, and other 
cities throughout the US.&nbsp; But no buildings were bombed or distroyed and 
the protest did not last for more than a few hours on Jan 6.&nbsp; But several people have been in jail for years without a 
hearing who do not deserve to be there.&nbsp; This is a real travesty of 
justice. The willingness of Democrats to fire people who disagree with them, or 
even put them in jail, should not be tolerated.&nbsp; They need to be voted out 
of office, so they understand that they can't get away with calling a protest an 
insurrection, they can't put men in women's sports, they can't teach our 
children that all white people are inherently racist, they can't cut up and 
castrate young children who haven't even reach puberty, they can't control our 
media, and they can't monitor us on 
the web.<o:p>&nbsp; The lawfare that the current administration has used 
against its political opponents must stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington state Democrats continue to do whatever they 
can to increase taxes, and take away our right to initiatives.&nbsp; We should 
suport all initiatives on the ballot this year,once again repealing the capital 
gains tax, repeal laws that take away our rights to purchase gas, and that give 
politicians control over us by claiming to fight climate change. We should keep 
a right to opt out of their socialist health care plans and make those decisions 
for ourselves.&nbsp; It is time for those who continue to vote for initiatives 
that prevent the Democrats from destroying our freedoms to vote the Democrats 
out.&nbsp; Bob Ferguson has fought for years to take our initiative process 
away, and we need to make sure he does not become governor.&nbsp; We should not 
continue to vote for initiatives, and for those who would end our right to 
initiatives.</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<o:p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This may be the last election where voters who are finally fed 
up can switch their votes and save our republic.&nbsp; We must defeat the 
Democrats so completely that they understand that they can't support evil and 
still get our votes. We must vote them out whether they are running for 
President, Governor, Senator, Representative, county council, school board 
member, or whatever.&nbsp; That is the only way that we can show them that we 
will no longer tolerate their destructive behavior.</o:p></p>
