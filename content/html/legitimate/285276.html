<h1>For the Glory of the Dominion!</h1>
<h3>Or how to kick the Universe while it's down..</h3>
The Dominion (abbreviated to DOM) is player group in the the Science Fiction Play-by-Mail game 'Beyond
 the Stellar Empire' run by
<a href="http://www.kjcgames.com/index.html">KJC Games</a>. ('Beyond the Stellar Empire' is hereafter
referred to as BSE). BSE will soon be totally revamped and improved, and will then be named Phoenix.
<p>
DOM are an affiliation (player group) where we pursue our own, freely defined goals in
this space game where you can pretty much do whatever you want. It is partly GM moderated so that total
freedom of action is guaranteed, inside the rules of the game that is, but rules are to broken..
<p>
Within these pages we hope to show how we portray ourselves to others in the game and how we really are
(there is an important difference).
<p>
<ul>
<li>A little disclaimer: the pages marked IC (In Character) are things that are assumed to be available in the
game as official material from the Dominion. There are of course a lot of waffle, half-truths, lies and so
on here, but such is the nature of politics in BSE. Pages marked OOC (Out Of Character) are pages aimed at
the <u>players</u>, and as such give out information not available in the game. This way we hope
that we can give everyone, especially new players, a better understanding of DOM.
