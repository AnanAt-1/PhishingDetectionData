              enough south to reach Gloucester. Bank Street in Gloucester during 
              the mid 1800s was part of the main carriage road to Prescott, hence

              Interestingly, Braddish Billings had also been involved in this

              estate. This self-serving route bypassing Ottawa's main industries 
              at Chaudiere Falls ended up being fatal as the railway went into 
              receivership in 1861. In 1871, a branch line to Chaudiere Falls 
              was built to correct this fatal flaw. This first railway connecting 
              Ottawa with Prescott was abandoned in pieces between the 1960s and 
              the 1990s but a short portion near Greenboro is still used by the 
              O-Train. It is likely that other portions of the right of way to 
              the south will also be used for the O-Train as it is extended in 
              the future.</em></font></p>
