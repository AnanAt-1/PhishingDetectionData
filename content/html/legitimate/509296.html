After college, he served in the military during the Korean War. Following his service he moved to New York City to study at the American Theatre Wing, and found a job as a janitor to make ends meet. He went on to star in a long list of highly successful plays and movies, becoming widely known as the voice of Darth Vader in the <em>Star Wars</em> film franchise. Jones won Tony Awards for his performances in <em>The Great White Hope</em> and <em>Fences</em>, and garnered an honorary Academy Award in 2011.

The work uniquely presents a narrative of the Nativity in a variety of musical moods. Special guest, James Earl Jones, shares his great oratory skills on the project by providing corresponding Scripture passages for each of the songs. This project is designed to bring to rememberance that through the voices of prophets, saints and angels the great watershed event of eternity was proclaimed, the coming of the very essence of God to dwell in human form. Embodied in a new-born babe, lying in a feed trough, in a dingy livestock shelter, so came the great hope for mankind, the Messiah, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lord, God's ultimate gift of love and redemption. </font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white"><em>Tid-Bits...</em></font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white">- Several of the songs in this cantata were first written some four decades ago with other works having been added in recent years to eventually create this finished project.</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white">- Star of stage and screen, James Earl Jones, overcame debilitating childhood stuttering to become one of America's greatest orators.</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="#eac89f">1.

She has garnered over one hundred hits, fifteen gold records, and four gold albums. As to her role in the history of recording, it should be noted that Patti Page, combined with the engineering and production skills of Mitch Miller, revolutionized the industry by being the first pop singer to overdub her own vocals. This event created a whole new dimension in sound recording. During the 1950s and 1960s she became the first and only female singer to have her own program on, what was at the time, all three of the major national television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS). </font></p>										<p><font color="white">LISTEN</font></p>										<p><font color="#eac89f"><a href="music/thank_you_for.mp3" target="_blank">Thank You For Being My Friend</a></font></p>										<p><font color="#eac89f"><a href="music/blessed_assurance.mp3">Blessed Assurance</a> - with Patti Page</font></p>										<p><font color="white">CREDITS</font></p>										<p><font color="#eac89f">Engineers: Ernie Couch, Jason Couch, Vocals: Patti Page, Jason Couch, Ernie Couch, Joe Cox, Matt Chaffin, Calvin Newton, Lisa &quot;Pee Dee&quot; Couch - Graphic design by Ernie Couch.</font></p>									</div>								</td>								<td align="left" valign="top">									<p><font size="+1" color="white">NURI Records (N5628CD) - released 2011<br />											Recorded at NURI Studio, Nashville, TN, Hilltop Studio, Nashville, TN, and The Family Room, Gallatin, TN</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white"><em>Today's Special</em> is a great mixture of old songs, new songs, fast songs, slow songs, original songs, and cover songs... something for everyone.

One moment the listener is swept up in the haunting melody and lyrics of Greg X. Volz's, self-penned, &quot;They That Wait Upon The Lord,&quot; only to be smacked in the face with the message of Ernie's edgy, hard driving, &quot;Knock, Knock, Knock, Knockin'.&quot; Also included are classic tunes such as, &quot;Through It All,&quot; &quot;The Wind Is Blowing Again,&quot; and &quot;Put Your Hand In The Hand Of The Man.&quot; Undoubtedly the production highlight of the project is Jason's killer song, I Know That I Know.&quot; On this cut John Lawry and Bob Hartman join <em>EC&amp;R</em> in hammering out the music, as Greg X.

Ernie stated that as a ten-year-old boy, setting before a black and white television with a snowy picture, watching George Beverly Shea singing at one of the great Billy Graham cursades, it never entered his mind that one day, some half century in the future, he would have the previlage of recording with Mr. Shea.</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white"><em>Tid-Bit</em> - When asked by Ernie about his earlist musical memory, Bev Shea shared the following.

One evening following the service, the guest singers said that they wanted to teach the Sheas a &quot;brand new&quot; song hot off the press. Bev said he recalled everyone gathering around the piano in the &quot;parlor,&quot; as they were taught this new song. The title of the song was, &quot;The Old Rugged Cross.&quot; The year was 1913.

The project represents the firming-up of what has become known as the <em>EC&amp;R</em> sound. Ernie's self-penned, &quot;Pilgrim Way,&quot; featuring Jason on lead vocal, was turned into the group's most popular early music video. Another Ernie composition, &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; became EC&amp;R's most requested song from the <em>Going Higher</em> project. James Blackwood not only joined the group as a guest on this project, but also did a great interview with Jason at the National Quartet Convention, that was included as a bonus feature on EC&amp;Rs, <em>First Decade</em>, DVD.</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white"><em>Tid-Bit - </em>The background white noise on the project's &quot;Countdown&quot; cut was produced by Ernie blowing into a long cardboard wrapping paper tube.

Hovie Lister often introduced Jake by referring to him as being, &quot;often immitated, but never duplicated,&quot; and such was the case. Jake is best remembered for his years with the Statesmen Quartet, his formation of the Imperials, work with the Master V, and for his part in the successful Gaither Homecoming video series. Jake had a great personality and sense of humor. Following the first lay down of his track, when recording, &quot;He's My Friend,&quot; for EC&amp;R's <em>Taking Flight</em> project, he was asked if he wanted to take another run at his part. With a big grim, Jake replied, &quot;Nope.

The group had previously recorded several demos at various Music Row studios. One of those cuts, &quot;If the Lord Wasn't Walking By My SIde,&quot; recorded at Ben Speer's Sweet Sixteen Studio, is included on this project. The balance of songs were recorded in the HIS Studio, at the former Conway Twitty complex, in Hendersonville, TN. Early on, <em>EC&amp;R</em> determined that each project would embody three unique characteristics - eclectic song selections, an iconic special guest, and creative graphics. This is the most traditional southern gospel project the group has released. <em>Taking Flight</em> features a half-and-half blend of classic, quartet songs inter- spursed with a broad spectrum of compositions from Ernie Couch. The group recorded several cover songs made popular by such groups as the Blackwood Brother, the Statemen and the Happy Goodman Family. Among the songs written by Ernie is one of his early works, &quot;He'll Be There,&quot; that had been recorded by the Plainsmen Quartet in 1969. For over five years, Ernie's self-penned, &quot;A Tree of Life For Me,&quot; was <em>EC&amp;R</em>'s most requested song. As to the special guest for the project, Jake Hess joined the group on, &quot;He's My Friend.&quot; Jake attend church with most of the group members, and was a mentor to and an encouragement in the group's formation.</font></p>									<p><font size="+1" color="white"><em>Tid-Bit - </em>In keeping with the project's title, the group members donned hot leather jackets on a scorching, ninety-six degree day in August, 1995 to pose during the cover photo shoot at Nashville International Airport.
