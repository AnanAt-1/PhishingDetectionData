<P>The software that we have for sale is what we use for our own production.
Many companies guard their proprietary software as if it was the crown
jewels, but we feel that it's great to get as many people to use it as
possible. In fact, the feedback that we get from the users is really helpful
toward making better tools for ourselves.</P>

<P>We have three major programs for sale right now. We have a rotoscoping
program, called <I><A HREF="roto/roto.html" TARGET="_blank">roto</A></I> that is easy to
use, fast, and supports motion-blurred rotoscoping in an unbelievably automatic
and intuitive way. We have a motion tracking/steadying tool, called <I><A HREF="ras_track/ras_track.html" TARGET="_blank">ras_track</A></I>,
that is used for 3D camera tracking, steadying shots, for marrying two
shots, and for tracking a element into an unsteady shot. Finally, we have
a morph program <I>ras_morph</I> that is a pretty standard spline-based
running-sequence or still-to-still morpher. It uses the algorithms from
the paper <I>Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis</I> that Thad presented
at <I>Siggraph '92</I>.</P>

<P>We have recently made available a radical new program for animating
moving backgrounds. The program allows the user to morph from still to
still to still, smoothly, with varying timing and motion across the image.
This is very useful in a number of cases:</P>

<UL>
<LI>blending between a series of painted backgrounds</LI>

<LI>slowing down motion</LI>

<LI>extending hand drawn animation to a longer sequence of frames</LI>

<LI>adjusting timing of a sequence without double-images</LI>
</UL>

<P>This program, called <I>animorph</I>, is available for testing now,
and will be finished and released by the end of June, 1997.</P>

<P>We have priced these very aggressively, <A HREF="contact.html">call
