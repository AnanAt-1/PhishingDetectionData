    <p>This listing of Linux VCS tools concentrates on VCS as a
    category distinct from project management, process management,
    workflow management, build control, release management, trouble
    ticketing, CASE, and other useful but adjoining functions. I'll
    try to mention where such extended features are present.</p>

    <p>Pointers (<img src="note.png" alt="[notable]">)
highlight entries notable in the opinion of this page's maintainer
(Rick Moen, <a href="mailto:%20rick@linuxmafia.com%20">rick@linuxmafia.com</a>), 
to whom complaints^Wcomments can be sent.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.accurev.com/">AccuRev</a> (AccuRev,
    Inc.)  <a name="accurev"></a>(<a href="#accurev">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>AccuRev is a client-server networked, transaction-based
    system. Automatically versions directories. Provides
    changeset/transaction-oriented (as opposed to file-based) pre and post
    triggers that can run on both the client and the server.
    AccuRev, Inc. (formerly Ede Development Enterprises) is coy
    about pricing, but in 1999 it was US $750 for a single licence,
    including a year of support and updates.</p>

    <p>Binary-only.  Proprietary.</p>

<br>
<br>

    <h3><a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/">Aegis</a> <a
name="aegis"></a>(<a href="#aegis">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Aegis is Peter Miller's transaction-based software
    configuration management system that enforces a development
    process requiring that change sets "work" before integration
    into the project baseline. It calls make and <a href="#rcs">RCS</a> 
    (or similar) for software-building and repository functions. Aegis is
    local-oriented (non-network-aware).</p>

    <p>Very mature.  Atomic commits.  Supports renames.  Poor Win32 support.  
    Heavy security focus and well-developed process integration.</p>

    <p>Code is C.  Open source (GNU GPL).</p>

<br>

    Harvest Change Manager</a> (Computer Associates, Inc.) <a
name="allfusionharvest"></a>(<a href="#allfusionharvest">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>AllFusion Harvest (formerly CCC/Harvest aka Change and
    Configuration Control/Harvest, which was published by Platinum
    Technology International, Inc.) is a multi-platform networked
    VCS that integrates with an optional build system and provides
    integrated problem tracking.</p>

    <p>Binary-only. Proprietary.</p>

<br>


    <h3>Arch <a name="arch"></a>(<a href="#arch">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Arch is an advanced <em>VCS specification</em> with multiple,
    independent but compatible implementations, and several 
    descendants/offshoots.  Arch is widely
    considered more ambitious than <a href="#svn">Subversion</a>, mainly on
    account of its support for decentralised 
    repositories: In Arch, any branch or
    developer's private work area can be treated as a repository of
    its own, with a global name space for developers, repositories,
    and branches, which you then periodically merge with a central
    repository.<p>

    <p>Please see also the individual entries for the several implementations 
    and offshoots of this specification:  <a href="#arx">ArX</a>, <a href="#barch">Barch</a>, <a href="#baz">Bazaar 1.x</a>, <a href="#bzr">Bazaar</a>, <a href="#eva">Eva</a>, <a href="#gnuarch">GNU Arch/tla</a>, <a href="#larch">Larch</a>.

    <p>All the various Arch implementations used to be linked from
    <a href="http://wiki.gnuarch.org/">Mat Kovach's Arch Wiki</a> (formerly 
    Michael Grubb's) &mdash; but recently (2005-04) the wiki seems to 
    have dropped all but GNU Arch/tla
    and Bazaar 1.x.</p>
    

<br>
<br>

 
    <h3><img src="note.png" alt="[notable]"><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/arx/">ArX</a> <a name="arx"></a>(<a href="#arx">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>ArX is Walter Landry's (no longer data-compatible) 2003 C++ 
reimplementation of 
the decentralised, networked <a href="#arch">Arch VCS specification</a>, 
originally inspired in part by dissatisfaction with poor portability 
and other problems in Tom Lord's original shell-script-based 
<a href="#larch">Larch</a> implementation.  As an Arch offshoot, ArX
is based on tracking deltas (changesets).  Archives, patches, and revisions 
are cryptographically signed using gnupg signatures and SHA-256 hashes.  
ArX can use ftp, ssh, sftp, http, and http w/WebDAV transport.
Internationalised but not localised.  Centralised development can 
be done via a patch queue.  Program ports to MacOS X, and in an 
"embryonic" fashion (2005-01-23) to Win32 (via Cygwin). 
On Linux, note (large) dependency on gnome-vfs.  
Beta as of 2005-04.  Possibly moribund (2008).</p>

    <p>Code is C++.  Open Source (GNU GPL).</p>

<br>
<br>


    <h3><a href="http://wiki.type-z.org/index.php/Projects/Archipel">Archipel</a> <a name="archipel"></a>(<a href="#archipel">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>A prototype distributed system coded on Python by "Sébastien".
    Repository is stored in a queryable RDF database.
    Extensible/modifiable using plug-in delta modules for different
    versioning models.  Version information is stored as SHA-1 hashes.</p>

    <p>It is unclear at this point (2005-04) whether this software is
    publicly available in any form, let alone open source.</p>

<br>
<br>


    <h3><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/robertc/">Barch</a> <a name="barch"></a>(<a href="#barch">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Barch (for "binary arch" &mdash; now defunct) was Robert Collins's 
(early) attempt at a compatible C++ implementation of the 
<a href="#arch">Arch VCS specification</a> 
&mdash; inspired in part by the need to transcend
technical and portability limitations in Tom Lord's then-current 
shell-script-based implementation, <a href="#larch">Larch</a>.  
The project appears to have 
stalled as of Collins's 0.0.6-DEVEL code released on 2002-12-29.  
However, more recently, Collins created <a href="#baz">Bazaar 1.x</a>
(now defunct).</p>

    <p>Code is C++.  Open source (GNU GPL).</p>

<br>
<br>


    <h3>Bazaar 1.x (baz) <a name="baz"></a>(<a href="#baz">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Bazaar 1.x (executable name "baz") was Robert Collins's fork for Canonical, 
Ltd. of Tom Lord's GNU Arch ("tla") C-language implementation of the 
<a href="#arch">Arch VCS specification</a>.</p>

    <p>It aimed to combine the essential features of 
<a href="#gnuarch">GNU Arch ("tla")</a> with user
interface improvements and Win32 support:  <a href="#svn">Subversion</a>-like 
diff, switch, import, export, and log commands.  A single merge command
allowed merging between arbitrary branches, daily builds,
internationalisation, Python bindings, Win32 binaries and an MS-Windows
GUI, an annotate/blame/praise command, comprehensive documentation, and UI
simplification.  History was stored separately from the working
directory.</p>  

   <p>As of 2005-08, Canonical decided to de-emphasise work on
Bazaar 1.x, put that codebase in maintenance mode, and concentrate 
on <a href="#bzr">Bazaar</a> ("bzr"), formerly Bazaar 2, as the 
true long-term successor for GNU Arch/tla.  Then, some time during 2006,
Bazaar 1.x was discontinued entirely.</p>

   <p>Code is C.  Open source (GNU GPL).</p>

<br>
<br>


    <h3><img src="note.png" alt="[notable]"><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar (bzr)</a> <a name="bzr"></a>(<a href="#bzr">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Bazaar (executable name "bzr"), initially called Bazaar-NG, later 
called Bazaar 2, is 
Martin Pool's networked, fully distributed, changeset-oriented 
variant implementation / offshoot, coded in Python for Canonical, Ltd., 
based on the <a href="#arch">Arch VCS specification</a>.</p>

    <p>It aims to combine the best feature of all the new VCSes 
(<a href="#darcs">darcs</a>,
<a href="#svn">Subversion</a>, 
<a href="#gnuarch">GNU Arch/tla</a>, 
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt">Quilt</a>, and 
<a href="#bk">BitKeeper</a>) "into a single coherent and simple system",
and has a simple <a href="#svn>Subversion</a>/<a href="#cvs">CVS</a>-like 
syntax for 
common operations like
add, mv, diff, status, commit, log, merge, etc.  Stores/checks SHA-1 
hashes of all patches and hashes of the tree state in each revision.  
Hashes can optionally be signed.  Stores changesets (deltas).  Control
files are stored inside the working directory tree.
Changesets can be sent/received over
e-mail, optionally gnupg-signed.  Renames, deletions, binaries are versioned.
Uses hashes for integrity checks, not
for identity.  Repository data are stored encoded in UTF-8.
Partial trees and per-file histories are not supported.</p>

<p>Though there is no dedicated network server program module, there is 
built-in support for "pull" synchronisation over a variety of network
mechanisms; by default, there is both "push" and "pull" support over 
sftp transport only, and sftp is supported only if you install the 
bzrtools extensions (plus Python modules paramiko and pyCrypto).</p>

<p>Bazaar is also the successor to the former Bazaar 1.x ("baz") 
project, and all baz repositories should by now (2006) have been
converted.</p>

<p>Change history is append-only.  Tool lets you "cherry-pick"
changes from one branch to another.  As a further advance on
Bazaar 1.x, each checkout is fully usable as a repository.  
At this date
(2005-04), bzr is not yet feature-complete.  Modular design: library + 
command-line client, making feasible use via library call from any 
other client.  All development takes place on branches, which are the 
highest-level grouping.  Forking of branches is by intention frequent
and has been made easy.  Three-way merge algorithm.  Allows merges within an arbitrary graph.  History-sensitive merges allow safe repeated merges, merges 
across renames, and mutual merges between parallel lines.  Checkouts default 
to the last archive you pulled from (as with darcs and BitKeeper).</p>

<p>Bazaar (v. 0.7) was one of three VCSes seriously 
<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/scm/bzr-eval">
considered</a> for hosting the very large OpenSolaris Project, and was
eliminated on grounds of slowness and high memory usage compared to git
and (the winner) Mercurial.</p>

<p>Trent Buck published a
<a href="http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/canon/words/darcs-bazaar.html">comparison</a>
of darcs and Bazaar (bzr) in 2006.</p>


<p>Code is Python script:  Tool should run anywhere
that Python 2.4 and above runs (i.e., Unixes including MacOS X, Win32, 
etc.).  Open source (GNU GPL).</p>

    <h3><img src="note.png"
alt="[notable]"><a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>, formerly
BK/Pro, formerly BitKeeper
    (BitMover, Inc.) <a name="bk"></a>(<a href="#bk">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Networked, changeset-oriented system (executable name "bk"). 
    Atomic commits.  Supports renames.  Supports file/directory copies 
    that retain version history.  Has some advanced merge methods, 
    based on line identity.  Uses time, rather than sequence, in some places.  
    Repository, which uses weave storage, gets fully
    replicated onto each developer's system (multiple repositories
    / staging areas).  History is stored with the working directory.
    Checked-out files must be marked before editing.  Patches from
others can retain their separate identity even after integration 
(are not collapsed/rolled up).  Has default GUI.  Emits lots of noise
messages, and has lots of weird commands.  Requires both per-file and
per-changeset commands.  Very space-efficient storage.  Has fine-grained
pre- and post-event triggers.  Can remotely find status of a tree, e.g.
parent, number of commiters, versioned files, extras, modified, etc.
Binary-only in recent versions. Was used by the
    majority of core Linux kernel developers until 2005-04, although some 
declined for licensing and other reasons. See: <a href="http://www.kerneltraffic.org/kernel-traffic/kt20030323_210.txt">analysis</a>
    of architectural advantages over competitors.</p>

    <p>Created by talented software engineer Larry McVoy strongly based
on his earlier experience at Oracle creating NSElite and then TeamWare.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><p><strong>Open source version</strong> emerged May 8, 2016
      with version bk-7.2ce as the successor to both the commercial
      and gratis-usage versions.  All improvements and other 
      changes are covered in the 
      <a href="https://users.bitkeeper.org/t/bk-7-2ce-released-2016-05-09/93">release
announcement</a>.  As of 2016, BitKeeper is under Apache License 2.0.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Proprietary for-pay version</strong> (discontinued a/o 2016-05) was either buy or
      lease: Lease was US $1000 to US $1750 annually per seat. Purchase was
      US $2800/seat to US $5800/seat. Pricing depended on quantity. One
      person who posted a BitMover price list was threatened (<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=41614&amp;cid=4396950">http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=41614&amp;cid=4396950</a>)
      with a copyright-violation lawsuit. Actual pricing 
      differed, and may have depended on sales negotiations. BitMover CEO
      Larry McVoy has <a href=
      "http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/2505.html">
      addressed</a> BitKeeper pricing on the kernel mailing
      list.<p>

      <p>As of 2004, the proprietary for-pay version, and not just 
      the proprietary gratis-usage version (below), likewise proved to be 
      <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/103694/">subject</a> to gaining 
      more restrictive conditions over time:  Developers who are
      considered likely to assist in development of competing VCSes
      are, starting 2004, refused the right to buy a copy.</p>

      <p>BitMover CEO Larry McVoy claimed in 2005-04 that his firm
      regarded hosted projects' metadata, e.g., who did which changes
      and when (the projects' change history), as 
      <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/15/perens_on_torvalds/page2.html">
      proprietary to BitMover, Inc.</a>, rather than being customer data.</p>

      <p>It also (2005) came to light that BitMover has some
      <a href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/bk/what-bitmover-got-wrong.html">undisclosed patents</a>.</p>

      <p>As of 2005-09, potential BitMover customers should be warned there were 
still ongoing <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2005-September/004745.html">reports</a> 
   of threatening letters sent to BitKeeper commercial licensees
whose staff separately perform development work on open-source VCSes.
(In the case linked to, the coder's employer claimed to infer in followup
telephone conversation with McVoy a threat to not renew licences).</p>

      <p>Proprietary.  Binary-only.</p>
</li>



      <li>
        <p><strong>Proprietary gratis-usage version (discontinued a/o 2005-04)</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Was encumbered by mandatory "<a href=
            "http://www.bitkeeper.com/v2_logging/">Open
            Logging</a>" of your metadata (privacy loss) if used
            with multi-user access.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Had a history of gaining more restrictive conditions
            over time. E.g.: The licence initially provided that,
            if the company's Open Logging servers ceased to function
            for 180 days, the software would convert to GPL, but
            that provision was later withdrawn. Source code access
            was also withdrawn. The non-compete clause was added. A
            provision was added (and later removed) to allow
            BitMover to terminate the licences of any individuals
            or groups whose usage is deemed to have cost BitMover
            over US $20,000 in support costs.</p>

            <p>Consequently: (1) Publicly posted comments about
            BitKeeper were often outdated. (2) It was recommended to
            download the program and read its current licence
            agreement. (See slightly outdated licence analysis,
            mirror copy <a href=
            "http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/x/i/xiphmont/Public/critique.html">
            1</a> <a href=
            "http://web.archive.org/web/20040813144236/http://www.taniwha.org/bitkeeper.html">2</a>, for
            which BitMover threatened author Jack Moffitt with
            litigation.  The reference to a mirror copy is necessary
            because BitMover successfully demanded suppression of 
            Moffitt's own pages on the subject.)</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Was subject to mandatory upgrading, per the licence's
            requirement, when new versions come out. There are
            compelling technical reasons why BitMover required
            this. However, it should be noted that replacement
            versions often introduced new licensing containing
            novel restrictions, such as the no-compete clause. (The
            point was not to portray this as somehow sinister: It was

    Supports advanced 3-way merge, versioning of any object

    that ClearCase licenses tend to cost around US $5000/seat plus 20%
    per year for support.</p> 

    <p>ClearCase's history goes back to 1984, when a team at Apollo

    <h3><a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/">CVS</a> <a name="cvs"></a>(<a href="#cvs">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is the ubiquitous
    old-school default, but has serious flaws:  No moves/renames, inefficient
    with binaries, no versioning of directories, no merge-history tracking
    (must be done manually through tagging), 
    no atomic commits or retrievals (i.e., no atomic tree-wide operations), 
    interacts badly with backup software, tends to leave stale locks, 
    doesn't deal well with
    symlinks/special files, often gets into merging snarls, branching 
    is often problematic and requires scrupulous attention to tagging, 
    changes are tracked per-file instead of per-change, development is 
    stagnant.  Tagging and branching are expensive
    operations.  No integrity checking:  Prone to repository corruption.
    Derived from script wrappers by Prof. Dick Grune of the 
    Free University of Amsterdam around the local-only <a href="#rcs">RCS</a> 
    system (written in 1984-5 and rewritten in C two years later by 
    Brian Berliner), it added concurrency control,
    annotations, and other enhancements. History is stored separately
    from the working directory (in the central repository), and can 
    contain many modules.  Working copies are separate and contain one
    module each.  Able to 
    transact data across network connections since 1994, making CVS 
    the first practical network-capable VCS.  Existing project history can be 
    revised, but only through special mechanisms.  Syncing of
    repositories is possible using add-on software CVSup.</p>

    <p>DARCS (David's Advanced Revision Control System), more often
    called "darcs", is David
    Roundy's <a href="#cvs">CVS</a>-replacement VCS, written in Haskell, handling all
    metadata, supporting fully decentralised repositories and
    advanced branching / patch-handling:  Distributed merge is implemented via 
    patch commutation.  History is stored with the working directory.
    (Control files are stored inside the working directory tree.)
    Atomic commits.  Supports renames.  
    Existing project history can be revised (which is potentially a
    drawback:  Interlopers can change what the history says).  Patches 
    from others can 
    retain their separate identity even after integration (are not 
    collapsed/rolled up) &mdash; and darcs also has the so-far unique 
    advantage of being able to track inter-patch dependencies, and 
    thus is the canonical example (and, really, the pioneer) of the 
    concept of "cherry-picking" of patches and groups thereof.  
    Based on tracking changesets (deltas).  Fully
    functional (but slower) Win32 port; also works on MacOS X.  
    Attempts to do all work entirely in RAM.  Simple to use; easy to learn.  
    Mature tool with active user community.  No crypto checksum on 
    the tree; no crypto signatures except on the transport.   Does not
    guarantee than any past revision can be reproduced.  Can 
    be extremely slow when resolving merge conflicts.</p>

    <p>The Haskell language is a rather obscure functional language,
    known to but few, and additionally is reported to characteristically 
    suffer unpredictable but sometimes severe performance problems.  
    Because of the language's obscurity, there have been relatively few 
    third-party contributions to the codebase.</p>  

    <p>darcs also suffers from impenetrable, poorly designed error 
    messages and diagnostics.  Each repository can only hold a single
branch of a single project:  To create a new branch, you must create
an entirely new repository.</p>

    <p>As of 2005-08, darcs's development branch is now alternatively
    able to work with <a href="#git">git</a> repositories.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>"<a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>", sometimes said to be 
short for "global information
tracker", is an extremely fast (especially for its 3-way patch merges
performed using GNU diffutils's "diff3" utility &mdash; which, however,
is relatively unsophisticated compared to other modern VCSes' merge
algorithms) 
object-addressable file-versioning/storage system developed with 
astonishing speed by Linus Torvalds with help from other Linux kernel 
developers starting 2005-04 as their primary source-management tool, 
after their licence to use <a href="#bk">BitKeeper</a> was revoked.  
Starting with the 2005-07 1.0 release, git has been managed by 
Junio C. Hamano.</p>

    <p>Like many recent VCS engines, git tracks/references checked-in
entities by their SHA-1 cryptographic hashes, storing large dataset
snapshots (full data collections rather than diffs) concerning several such
"entities" for each file checked in (in a pseudo-filesystem, complete
with its own fsck utility), thus gaining speed at some cost in disk
space consumed.  There is an optional space-efficient (but rather
kludgey and allegedly fragile), "packed" format that saves spaced 
and network bandwidth by delta-fying file revisions (i.e., transforming
them into a changeset format) where possible, that can be used with 
its "repack" command.  </p>

    <p>Commits are not signed; however, tags are.  Also, Torvalds
simplified the problem domain by deciding to have git not handle file
renames/moves at all, nor some metadata such as time stamps.  (Torvalds
feels these are non-essential, believing for example that renaming foo
to bar should be treated as destroying foo and creating bar, and that
tracking the movement of content between files, which it is intended to
do eventually, is more important than filenames, which are just
transitory labels.)  There is also no explicit <em>file</em> "history"
as such.  Project history is stored as a directed acyclic graph, making
long-lived branches and repeated merging simple.  (Delete file, commit,
create new file with the same name, commit, is a supported sequence of
operations. After the file is re-created and committed in the final
step, it inherits the history of the original file.)</p>

    <p>Permissions and ownership appear not to be versioned; only the
execute bit is archived and preserved, of that class of metadata.</p>

    <p>Binaries are of course versioned.  Partial trees and per-file
histories are not supported (though the git core commands will
extract the revisions that affected this file when asked for the
history of a file).</p>

    <p>As with other decentralised VCSes, each git checkout is
a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking capabilities.
Synchronization between repositories is done via explicit push/pull
operations.  Location of the metadata/history information can be 
specified using environment variable GIT_DIR, thus allowing you
to use less space in your working files area, have less cruft there, 
keep your version history on archival media, etc.</p>

    <p>Networked access is supported, with SSH support built in, and no
dedicated server component.  The presence of GNU RCS is helpful for
merge operations but not required.</p> 

    <p>There is a separate tool git-update-index, that for some
operations, e.g., add, but not others, e.g., mv, is required to update
repository state for a file in the repository (before a commit).
There is an "fsck" command to recover corrupted repositories.</p>

    <p>git v. 1.2.2 through 1.2.4 was one of three VCSes seriously considered
(<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/scm/git-eval.txt">1</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/scm/git-report-final.txt">2</a>) 
for hosting the very large OpenSolaris Project, and was
eliminated on grounds of a half-dozen operational disadvantages and
design flaws compared to (the winner) Mercurial.</p>

    <p>Code is C, and depends on zlib, libcurl, and OpenSSL's
libcrypto to build, and rsync 2.6.0 or later to run.  It thus
appears to use rsync for network transport.  Open source (GNU GPL).

   <li>
   <p><a href="http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/">Cogito</a> 
(formerly git-pasky) is Petr "Pasky" Baudis's
set of higher-level VCS services (a UI wrapper aka "porcelain") designed
to complement the git engine, comprising an arguably complete VCS.
Note: Cogito stores only one project per repository, but allows multiple
branches within a repository.</p>

    <p>Cogito appears to use rsync, http, and ssh as network transports.  
It is written in bash shell script and thus is not portable to non-Unix 
systems, notably MS-Windows (absent Unix-ey retrofits such as Cygwin).  
Open source (GNU GPL).</p>

    <p>The git/Cogito combination evolved rapidly during its first 
six months and achieved strong acceptance, but since 2006 has been
officially deprecated, replaced by improvements in the git tool's own
native user interface.  As of 2007, the redoubtable Ted T'so

list of committed patches, a graphical trace showing which tree each
patch was merged from, tags, the selected patch and commit text, and a
list of files that will be touched by the selected patch.  It does not
aspire to provide a full VCS superstructure similar to Cogito.</p>

patch per line, with annotations, making it easy to figure out which
commit modified a specific piece of code).  It does not aspire to
provide a full VCS superstructure similar to Cogito.</p>

   <p>Double-clicking lines in the patch list bring up patches in "diff -up"

similar to Cogito.</p>

    <p>Quoting the author:  "The idea of StGIT is to keep a set of
patches (tens usually) always on top of the main repository you are
tracking until they get merged into it. At that point, the StGIT patch
would become empty and can be safely removed. StGIT is not intended to
be used as an VCS where you can create thousands of patches. You expect
the patches to be merged upstream and removed from the stack. It closely

based on manipulating patches.  Its snapshot mechanism, rewind, patch,
and ipatch commands are intended to help "individual developer"
users (as opposed to "project lead" ones) first develop a working version 
in a random order, and then refactor the working version into a clean 
sequence of changes to be fed upstream.  Deliberately does not 
support per-file commits, on grounds of that being bad workflow: 
Developers are helped to work with snapshots and patches, instead.

    <h3><a href="http://gnuarch.org/">GNU Arch 1.x ("tla")</a> <a name="gnuarch"></a>(<a href="#gnuarch">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>GNU Arch 1.x (executable name "tla", for Tom Lord's Arch) is Tom
    Lord's second (compatible) implementation, this time in C, of his 
    decentralised, networked <a href="#arch">Arch VCS specification</a>.
    It is now (2006) maintained by Andy Tai.
    Very complex, arguably
    overfeatured system.  Does star-merge.  Patches from others can 
    be collapsed/rolled up upon integration so as to lose their separate
    identities.  Atomic commits.  Supports renames.  Commits are gnupg-signed.  
    Parseable/scriptable shell
    interface; uses tar, gzip, and patch.  Changelogs are autogenerated.  
    Uses weird, often problematic filenames 
    featuring (e.g.) leading "++", ",,", "=", and "{ ... }" sequences.  
    Uses inode signatures to detect file modifications, leading to some 
    false alarms,
    e.g., when copying a tree.  Uses MD5 hashing (insecure) for archive 
    verification; will 
    eventually move to SHA-1:  Only patches (not complete revisions) are
    signed.  Uses sequence, rather than time, to determine precedence
    of changes.
    Can use ftp, sftp, WebDAV, and plain http transport. 
    Relies on ssh for remote access, authentication, and confidentiality.
    Changesets can be also conveyed via e-mail.  
    A dedicated arch-server component isn't really 
    needed, but has been 
    <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-arch-users/2004-01/msg01069.html">prototyped</a>, or alternatively one could use Colin Walters's
    Python-based <a
href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-arch-users/2004-01/msg01069.html">archd</a>
software and matching protocol (using TCP port 2420).</p>
    
    <p>Interested parties will find Nick Moffitt's concise and focussed 
    "<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7604>Arch">Arch 
    for CVS Users</a>" tutorial an excellent place to start.</p>
    
    <p>David A. Wheeler's 
    <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html">SCM essay</a>
    points out some of GNU Arch's current (2004-03) problems:  (1) 
    The Win32
    port is currently missing quite a few features (symlinks, most file 
    permissions, correct handling of newlines), and in general GNU Arch
    may never be fully functional on non-POSIX systems.  (2) The repository's
    file-naming conventions use very badly chosen special characters 
    that tend to break vi, more, the C shell, various scripting languages, 
    and other primary tools.  (3) Automated cache management is missing
    (making the program slow by default), and is badly needed.  
    (4) Merging breaks if branches aren't either 
    all commit-based or all tag-based, but the tool doesn't enforce 
    that limitation.  (5) "mv" and "move" do very different things, and 
    in general the full command set is needlessly complex.</p>

    <p>Wheeler considered almost all of these to be short-term
    problems.</p>

    <p>Lord had released, working entirely by himself, three development 
betas of a GNU Arch 2.0 redesign (executable name "revc") incorporating 
ideas from Bazaar ("bzr"), git, and Monotone, including a belated switch 
from MD5 to SHA-1 checksums.  However, my guess is that the 2.0 effort 
(at minimum) is now (2005-08) defunct.</p>

    The GNU Project adopted tla as "GNU Arch" in 2003-07.</p>  

    <p>Code is C.  Open source (GNU GPL).</p>  

    <p><em>Maintainer's personal note:  In my opinion, GNU Arch's 
    implementation flaws are sufficiently grievous that people
    considering its use should hasten to substitute Canonical's 
    compatible replacement, <a href="#bzr">Bazaar ("bzr")</a>, in
    its place.</p>

    <p><em>It appears that I'm not alone in this perception:  As
of 2005-08-15, Tom Lord announced that he was
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-arch-users/2005-08/msg00030.html">
resigning effective immediately</a> as GNU Arch maintainer, endorsed Bazaar 
1.x ("baz") as an immediate direct replacement, and expressed hope that 
Bazaar ("bzr") will eventually take its place, in turn.  The main GNU 
Arch developers other than Lord had already left that project, by that 
point, and had become Bazaar 1.x coders.</em></p>

<p>2005-10 update:  Developer Andy Tai has 
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-arch-users/2005-10/msg00246.html">taken over<//a> the GNU Arch project lead, and it has resumed.</em></p>

    "http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> <a
name="hg"></a> (<a href="#hg">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>Mercurial (executable name "hg"), by Matt Mackall, is a distributed 
VCS inspired by certain of
<a href="#monotone">Monotone's</a> design elements, and said to be similar in
some ways to <a href="#git">git</a>/Cogito, but storing changes instead of whole files, 
saving storage and making some functions related to file history easier to 
perform.  Very compressed storage, as a result.  Note: Mercurial stores only one
project per repository, but allows multiple branches within a repository.
Control files are stored inside the working directory tree.</p>

    <p>Uses SHA-1 hashes of changesets for integrity-checking, supports
fully decentralised operation and arbitrary merging.  Merging keeps all
metadata on each changeset (committer, message, etc.).  Everything is a
branch.  Provides command-line and Web interfaces.  Uses http and ssh as
network transport.  Can also use e-mail as transport ("hg export" to export
changesets, mail the changesets, then "hg import").  Changeset numbers 
are referred to by sequential numbers.  "hg serve" starts a built-in 
Web server, and serves up the branch for "pull" access.</p>

    <p>Renames, deletes, and permissions are versioned, but rename is
implemented as copy and delete.  (Fortunately, a file created with the
same path as one deleted inherits the old file's history.)  No support
for partial trees.  Per-file history is available by specifying the filename 
with "hg log".  No direct support for "cherry-picking":  However, an
equivalent can be achieved by exporting specific patches from one repo
(branch), and importing them into another repo.</p>

    <p>Repositories are normally fully independent, but can be
configured to have a <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/message.jspa?messageID=30643&tstart=0">de
facto parent</a>.  Network access is supported via SSH, http (in "pull"
mode) and of course network filesystems.  There is no built-in facility
for controlling access (via ACLs) to subtrees.  Repository internal storage
format is binary (hence, fast) but platform-neutral.</p>

    <p>Offering repo access via plain http ("pull") access from commodity Web 
servers (a very desirable feature) is complicated (2005-09) by the fact that 
the "<a
href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2005-September/004658.html">preferred method</a>" for publishing such a repo requires uploaders to 
continually first create "bundles" to hold the contents, and for 
downloaders to know that things are bundled, and (apparently) even 
to know what the bundles are named.</p>

    <p>Mercurial was one of three VCSes seriously considered
(<a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/scm/mercurial-eval.html">1</a>,
<a

    <p>Monotone (executable name "mtn") is Graydon Hoare's 2003 distributed 
    (networked) VCS with
    a flat peer model, cryptographic (SHA-1) version naming and metadata
    certificates (SHA-1 identification of all files, directories and 
    revisions), decentralized authority, atomic commits, 
    versioned file and directory renames (unlike, say, 
    <a href="#hg">Mercurial</a>), and 
    overlapping branches.  Supports file/directory copies that
    retain version history.  Distributed merging is implemented via 3-way
    merge.  Tracks changesets (deltas).  Identifies 
    revisions using chained hashes, 
    requiring only one signature to authenticate a line of development.   
    Uses rename history instead of file-IDs to determine file identity.  
    Monotone works out of a transactional version database
    stored in a regular file (using sqlite). Network communication
    is mediated via HTTP, netnews (NNTP), or SMTP transport.
    Code is C++ and Lua. Mechanisms such as cryptographic hashing are too 
    exposed for many people's tastes.  Nice graph tool.  Good manual and
    Web pages.  Project is now 
    self-hosting, and while still being experimental now (2005-05) has a
    stable database schema and a reliable datastore.  

    <p>Note:  One of the reasons Linus Torvalds started the 
    "<a href="#hg">git</a>" project is that he tried Monotone, and 
    liked many of its aspects, but found it unacceptably slow at the 
    time (but not as slow as <a href="#darcs">darcs</a>).
    Monotone has gained performance considerably since that
    time, when the designer had not yet found and fixed a serious 
    performance bug.  It is reported (2005-08) that the "initial pull" 
    initial repository clone still takes quite a long time, but that
    this is being worked on.  (2008 update:  That has now been
    addressed.)</p>

    "http://sccs.sourceforge.net/">SCCS</a> 
    <a name="sccs"></a>(<a href=#sccs">link</a>)</h3>

    <p>SCCS (Source Code Control System) is the oldest VCS, a
local-oriented (non-network-aware) system developed 
in 1972 by Marc Rochkind at Bell Labs on an IBM System/370 running OS/MVT.  
It's the first change-management system to record a distinct identifier 
for each revision and keep a clear revision history.  Version numbers 
are in format "major.minor".  Uses weave storage, which makes it an 
<a href="http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20061006032137/http://blog.fxa.org/articles/2005/09/30/bzr-weaving-its-way-to-the-front">excellent
foundation</a> for building advanced VCSs, despite SCCS's antiquity.   
Does locking, uses a central repository.  Versions files (doesn't do
changesets).  J&ouml;rg Schilling, who now maintains SCCS, says support for
binary files was added under Sun Microsystems's sponsorship of the
project in late 1986.  No merging.  Confusing
command-line interface (if you're used to RCS, at least; opinions
are divided on this matter).</p>

    <p>Maintainer J&ouml;rg Schilling has written in (2011-07) to say that he
intends to develop SCCS into a distributed system with atomic operations 
soon, and that the upcoming 5.1 version already adds a number of smaller
improvements that can be implemented without breaking compatibility to
the history file format.  He also reports impressive speed during import of 
all OpenSolaris base OS source code into SCCS (500 MB in over 46000
files): 17 seconds on tmpfs, on a 2.4 Ghz AMD Opteron system, which
equates to 2700 files/sec and 30 MB/sec.  (Thank you, J&ouml;rg.)</p>

    <p>Code is C.  Open source.  In recent years, SCCS had been a
mixture of CDDL, GNU GPL, GNU LGPL licensing.  J&ouml;rg Schilling, a 
noted proponent of CDDL licensing, reports that he's somehow converted the 
codebase to pure CDDL (2011-07).  (2011-07-07 addendum:  J&ouml;rg asserts
that the codebase never had GPL or LGPL components.  As it was
originally written in SNOBOL by Marc J. Rochkind for a 1970s IBM System/370
mainframe running OS/360's MVT variant, and then rewritten by 
Rochkind in C for AT&amp;T PWB/UNIX and carried forward into various AT&ampT
System III and System V proprietary Unix releases, that is distinctly
possible.  I currently lack the time and interest to further research
licensing history.  2011-07-07 addendum #2:  Spot-checking the SCCI 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sccs/files/">1.0 source
tarball</a>from 2007, I find GPL source code and an apparent reference 
to prior LGPL source code, so J&ouml;rg's recollection appears to be
incorrect.)

    <p>Subversion (aka SVN; executable name "svn") is specifically designed 
    as a <a href="#cvs">CVS</a> replacement (developed starting 2000),
    fixing all of the long-known design flaws in CVS: It adds
    versioning of directories, intelligent handling of
    binary files, and handling of all
    file metadata including symlinks (missing: to be fixed
    post-1.0). Revision numbering is per-commit instead of
    per-file.  Atomic commits.  Supports file/directory copies that
    retain version history.  The repository stores snapshots
    of works, not changesets (deltas).  As with CVS, Subversion follows a 
    centralised development model; this is not a distributed,
    decentralised VCS, though the <a href="#svk">SVK</a> extensions 
    adapt Subversion to create one.  Designed-in network operations are
    over either WebDAV, or a lightweight custom protocol called 
    svnserve, which runs on port 3690 and can be anonymous or 
    authenticated by a svnserve-specific password file.  
    Alternatively, svnserve can provide authentication through SSH.
    No history-sensitive merging (no merge history tracking) as in 
    <a href=#gnuarch">GNU Arch/tla</a>:  Trying to reapply a 
    patch more than once can cause problems.   Uses rename history
    instead of file-IDs to determine file identity.
    Existing project history can be revised, but only through special 
    mechanisms.  Original Subversion repository design used the
    BerkeleyDB database as a back-end store; in more recent versions, 
    you can optionally use a filesystem/flatfile-based "fsfs" store 
    if you prefer.</p>

    <p>Despite ubiquitous claims to the contrary from its proponents
    and from the program's official features list, it has turned out 
    (2005) that Subversion <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/4563.html?thread=33747#t33747">cannot handle file renames</a>:  
    Renames are implemented as deletion of the old file and separate copy 
    to a new file, with the result that the file's version history gets 
    broken.  As Codeville's Bram Cohen points out, this "is even worse 
    behavior than CVS has".</p>
