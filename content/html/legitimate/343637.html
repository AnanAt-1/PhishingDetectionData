to Seymour, Indiana, where it remained until October 01, 1949, when it was purchased by Universal 
Air Marine and Supply Company for the Bolivian Government.  It is believed 
while at Seymour, Indiana the aircraft was registered as NX26927 and 
participated in the National Air Races. The owner was listed as Howard LeVier 
of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  On October 03, 1949 the aircraft was flown on a 
ferry permit from Seymour, Indiana to Schrom Field, Maryland.  On November 01, 
1949 on a acceptance test flight flown by the Bolivian pilot the now 
undocumented aircraft was involved in a midair collision with Eastern 
Airlines Flight 537. (N88727, ex 43-17165 a C-54B-10-DO, MSN 18365/DO138) 
while both were on an approach to runway 03 at Washington-National Airport. 
From the C-54B, 4 crew, 51 PAX fatal. From the P-38, the Bolivian test pilot 
survived, both aircraft were destroyed. It was (at the time) the worst plane 
crash in the history of civil aviation.  The P-38 pilot was accused of causing 
the accident, later tried and cleared of the charges, which now is believed to have 
been an ATC error.
