	<p>He made Africa real.  The complexity of its politics and simply staying alive; of its explosive beauty and elegance, its pure reality of the circle of life itself.<br />
From the playing fields of pristine, protected West University to the squalor and danger of the worlds largest earth colored canvas he left foot prints that will never be filled.</p>

	<p>As we all move into our &#8220;Golden Years&#8221; a time will come when the reality of leaving is a consideration in how we conduct and live our lives. But when someone is called to leave at such a young age when ordinarily there is so much more to share with a wife, children and a place I am sure he so loved, it greatly brings a depth of sorrow and sadness. I didn&#8217;t have any personal contact with Corbett except for one occasion when we used him as a model for an ad for an apartment complex. Kirsten Soderlind produced an illustration of him holding a frog with his Alamo t-shirt and a big smile. I remember him being a great kid and model. Glad we used him.</p>
<p>The Safari will miss him as I am sure his family and friends will the most.</p>

	<p>Corbett, my friend. I am still in shock at your sudden departure. It just does not seem possible that the earth has lost such a valuable being. You inspired me always, as I hope your memory will continue to do for myself and everyone who encounters your legend.</p>

	<p>David and Corbett throwing a football in the street.  The ball sailing through Corbett&#8217;s hands and hitting him square in the face.  HIs tearful lament wishing for just &#8220;one happy day&#8221;.  We laughed and he was often quoted.  One happy day.  Corbett the fortunate man. Finding his passion early and living it.  One happy day.   Africa. Ol Takai. Game preservation.  One happy day.  The Maasai.  Protecting a gentle people.  One happy day.  A loved man. A life well lived.  Gone too soon.  A thousand happy days.  Thank you Corbett,  for all our days with you.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a person who met Corbett who didn&#8217;t immediately think he was a person they were unlikely to forget for the rest of their lives.  We&#8217;re all so lucky to have known him and the world is a much less interesting, funny and warm place without him.  He was a great friend and I will miss him so much.</p>

	<p>Words cannot express my sadness at the news of Corbett&#8217;s too short life&#8230; but it always was a life lived to the fullest&#8230;from the early years on the soccer fields at West U to the heart of Africa&#8230;Corbett seemed to be one who followed his own way&#8230;may all of us, each time we think of Corbett, truly learn that life is an adventure to be lived each day&#8230;. every day&#8230;.</p>

	<p>I have funny, wacky memories of Corbett in college&#8211;the necklace, scruffy face, hair, intensity. I remember one late night where he and Michael Kolp showed up at our house off-campus and then decided to throw old apples at each other. Why? Who knows. . . I will remember your crazy energy. He was always the person who I knew would do what he wanted to do (outdoors of course), going all the way. . .</p>

	<p>I have always considered myself something of an adventurer.  But I must admit my friend that I lived the best adventures through you.  I remember the look in your eye when you were maybe three years old.  It was the wide-eyed look of an old soul who had great travels in front of him.  I&#8217;m sure Marco Polo had the same look.  But along with that beautiful adventurous spirit beat the good heart of a gentle soul.  I was never in your company that I did not feel lightened.  You lived your life well my friend and you packed more into your 38 years than the rest of us do in a lifetime.  You will be magnificently missed.</p>

	<p>What an unbelievable guy.  I met him in high school through his good friend Larkin.  He was amazing even then.  Seriously, who is really amazing in high school!   How blessed he was to lead such an incredible life.  I am certain that I have never met or will ever meet anyone as truly free as him.  I must say that I have admired him as long as I have known him.  </p>
<p>Bill and I were so sad to hear of his passing.  We feel blessed to have randomly seen him in January after not laying eyes on him in fifteen or so years.   We enjoyed hearing about his life in Africa.  We have been comforted to know that he led such a full life.  </p>
<p>We will all miss you, your wonderful smile and your great wit.  </p>

	<p>Corbett was a great human being. I will never forget when he and Micheal Kulp and I were driving along in that jeep thing he had at Colby and Corbett dove out from behind the wheel unexpectedly leaving me to dive from the back seat to the driver’s seat to control the vehicle as it did not appear that Kulp was even remotely interested in driving (of course he was in on it too).</p>
<p>I was in close contact with Micheal before he passed away and I know he and Corbett were buddies. Micheal was struck by lightning leading are wilderness trip in the Minnesota Boundary Waters and his passing had a profound impact on my life as I imagine it had for Corbett. The two were clearly cut from the same cloth! My sincerest condolences to his family.</p>

	<p>Corbett truly lived life to the fullest, and my memories of him will certainly live forever. Whether it was some crazy escapade or an evening of music and hanging out, Corbett made his mark on all our souls. We spoke a few times in recent years (well, emailed) of my bringing my family to Africa to visit him and his family. Corbett, don&#8217;t you think for a second that I wont still do just that.<br />
Don&#8217;t you and Michael have too much fun up there. Keep an eye on us all. 🙂</p>

	<p>Corbett, old friend, I have so many profound memories of you that my mind is swimming in cowboy boots, snuff, and guitars.  Among your many inspirations was a little habit of writing poems.  Particularly, you encouraged me to do so when I felt least up to it.  This is one of those times.  You had a larger effect on our lives than concepts like friendship or love seem capable of conveying too directly.  I am working on one now, in your honor, although I think they all were in your honor.  It is called LION IN THE HOUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS, and is about the time you told me to stop calling you &#8220;Bishop.&#8221;  I&#8217;m listening to Willie Dixon as we often did, and the Reverend Gary Davis, trying to feel my way through the stopping and starting of so many conversations over the years, trying to get just a taste of your passion for life into the lines, and knowing that if you were here to see me fall short, you&#8217;d probably lip off one of those trademark hard-boiled lines, meant to convey your honest assessment but also you immense appreciation of the gesture.  I remember when I read you a not great poem and you told me it was a &#8220;triumph of illiteracy.&#8221;  &#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble with trouble, it gets what it wants,&#8221; you said, and &#8220;that poem has trouble.&#8221; I know too that even though we fell out of touch, it was the nature our relationship to stop and start, to flit in and out of each other’s lives, and to repeat and repeat ourselves often at all hours of the night until one of us either held the other&#8217;s mouth shut or woke up to how urgent everything is. </p>
<p>Vaya, mi amigo. You were one of a kind.</p>

	<p>Stan,<br />
Though we never met, I feel like I knew a bit about you from hearing Corbett tell me how you were the greatest writer he knew, and other accolades that only make sense to a Texan, I reckon.</p>
<p>Not being a Texan myself, I was impressed enough with his respect for your writing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been 10 or so years since Corbett passed away, but I think of that dude  quite a bit still.</p>
<p>I would be curious and honored to know if your passion to put pen to paper has burned itself into a shadowy silence, or if writing is still choosing you to do it&#8217;s dirty &#8216;n dangerous work.</p>
<p>I remember Corbett telling me how difficult it was for you to resume writing after an accident or trauma of some nature had befallen you right before I met him in &#8217;89.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really none of my business, but as a writer whom Corbett had tremendous respect for, I as a writer have always been hoping to read some of your work.</p>
<p>Should you ever be inclined to reply, I would be grateful and honored.</p>
<p>I live a life, here in Cambodia, that I can only be certain is mine.</p>
<p>I do my best to live in a manner that I, as well as Corbett and a select few other kindred souls who have crossed the river of life, can be proud of.</p>
<p>And in one of my anthologies I have a typewritten page with the words &#8220;&#8230;Trouble gets what trouble wants&#8230;&#8221;  chiseled into a sheet of crinkly old, pre-laser printer, typewriter paper, circa 1991.</p>
<p>Now I know where W.C.B. got it from.</p>
<p>You were one who Wesley Corbett Bishop&#8217;s looked up to.<br />
He told me that often.<br />
And W.C.B. is someone I have always looked up to.</p>
<p>So, as one old man lucky to still be breathing, I offer a contact point, should y&#8217;all be innarested.</p>

	<p>Living far away has many positive aspects however the biggest downside is you loose touch with your friends. Corbett and I shared that&#8230; my sweet Mother would bumped into one of his parents and the next day I would have a full report awaiting me about him, his wife and children and all the incredible things they would be doing. I loved hearing about him! </p>
<p>I am praying for his sweet children, wife, and parents! He was a wonderful person and a joy to have know growing up.  We will miss you!</p>

	<p>Though I never knew him, I do know this &#8211; he touched one of my friends, whose judgement I respect, very deeply, and I know that Corbett was an unusual, beautiful, interesting, intelligent and passionate man.

	<p>It is so rare that a person lives their passion&#8230;.what a wonderful achievement in this life we live. Corbett was a lucky man who knew life and loved what he did with the passion few of us ever experience. My heart breaks for you Cindy, this loss is so hard to accept&#8230;.<br />
how lucky Corbett was to have a Mother like you!</p>

	<p>As has happened with too many old friends from college, I had lost sight of Corbett, knowing only that he was in Africa, which I knew made him happy.</p>
<p>I remember him telling me life was easy. Life can be easy when you know how to create it passionately as well as wait for it to move around you. Now that I think back to the times I spent with him, I realize that Corbett embodied living in the moment more than anyone I have ever met. </p>
<p>He was a brilliant, wild, intense, and loving person. I&#8217;m sure he is shaking up things in his new life and wish his family all the best in this one. </p>

	<p>My heart goes out to Corbett’s family, and all of his extended families across continents…Corb had a unique way of making everyone feel at home in his presence. The measure of this man was cut long ago and I know each of our lives have been enriched in countless ways for having had Corbett involved in then in one way or another.</p>
<p>For me, this is such a surreal place to be…to be writing a letter to/for/in honor of Corbett…surreal in the sense that I know he will not respond…he always did…even if months or years apart…we always picked up right where we left off.  I am blessed to have shared a significant part of my life with such a man…I knew the minute I met him on that Friday afternoon in downtown Houston 1987 that I’d met someone special.  For some reason or other, Corbett and I just “got” each other…and his friendship to me over the next 20+ years has often been a source of strength.  I know he knew this.  We were both so proud of each other and loved to hear how the other was thriving…if I had a dollar for every time Corb told me to “Get after it…go…go…go!  I’ll listen to the trials after you get there…now go!”  He was inspirational and energizing, and so I read on this website, to many others as well….this was one of his many “gifts”….if he ever really knew it or not.</p>
<p>On behalf of my entire family, we will miss him dearly.  We feel so fortunate to have had the grand opportunity to see, hug, catch up with Corb last August on the NW Serengeti. Among the treasure chest of memories, I will forever hold this is dear to my heart and I cannot imagine that God didn’t is some way grant me this to soften the blow.  He was so excited to see me and my parents and to tell me all about Luca and Ella and about how they meant the world to him.</p>
<p>It’s been difficult for me to get my head around the idea that Corbett will not be there…his warm inviting smile/chuckle…his contemplative response to my inquires that have no “real” answers…his twinkling eyes.   But to me this seems a bit selfish and he would have hated the idea of tears after tears.  I can hear him say, “ok enough is enough, get going…with purpose.”  He’d rather be moving&#8230;some might think he was a restless soul, maybe that is true, but I do know that he knew love, he was loved (by many), he loved being loved, and he loved his family.  If I know Corb, he has needlessly charmed his way into Heaven and started on getting answers to questions that have long been twirling in his mind!</p>
<p>In a letter I just recently re-read that Corbett sent to me circa 1990….he wrote, “Life’s great promise is death.  Lark, I don’t like it, but that is the way it is.  To be a bit less dreary, I’m stoked about going surfing tomorrow on my new long board. Tell your folks hi. Be safe, CB ” (made me smile because he always had a way or mixing it up and then getting exited about his next adventure)</p>
<p>No doubt, Corbett wove himself into the fabric on my being, I’m a better person for have known and loved him, and I’m so comforted by hearing all the others that share the same.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Larkin</p>

	<p>I met Corbett in Maine, in the fall of 1989. To meet and connect with him, was to fall in love with him~ with his spirit, his humor, his sense of adventure. His love of life was contagious. Corbett taught me how to hop a train and how to really embrace the moment. Many of my memories are of climbing rocks and trees and mountains with Corbett, and goofing around with Michael Kolp together. Damn, those two were the best sort of trouble together. But one of my favorite shared moments with Corbett was late one night, pounding out poetry together on antique typewriters and drinking hot earl gray tea with gin. lots of gin. we talked about philosophy and life and purpose, and Not Missing It&#8230;and then we ran outside and howled at the moon and rolled down a grassy hillside until we were gasping for breath because we were laughing so hard. I will miss him dearly. Corbett&#8217;s spirit shines just as brightly to me today as it always has. This was one of his true gifts.<br />
much love,<br />

	<p>It&#8217;s a shock to hear that someone so young, and so in the middle of his life can pass away, just like that. The world will definitely be a more boring place without you, Corbett! I wish you a safe last safari, and hope you&#8217;ll continue to bring inspiration &#8211; and the occasional bit of uproar &#8211; wherever you are.</p>
<p>My sympathy to your family and close friends.</p>

	<p>After looking at the pictures on this website you just know that the phrase, &#8220;A life well-lived&#8221; must have been coined to describe Corbett&#8217;s time on earth.  Such a hard loss to accept, but I know you must take great comfort in the wonderful memories and the two beautiful children he leaves behind.  Norm and I are thinking of you, Cindy, and hoping you find peace in remembering the good times.</p>

	<p>Where to begin? I could write a thousand pages of memories, stories, laughs, screw-ups, near-disasters, true disasters and moments of genius. That’s the sort of person he was. Life was never dull, that’s for sure. I have known Corbett since the mid-nineties in our young days of running around Arusha with not a care in the world, bragging that we had everything a person needed… a truck, a motorbike and a .458. From those early days until now… it has indeed been a lifetime. He packed it all into his 38 years. </p>
<p>I think of the old days, singing Hank Jr and Sublime in the bush, and then I think of being Ella’s goddad and my memories change to him cuddling with his kids on the couch and Ella asking some little question about a beetle. I think of buffalo hunting trips, where he and I would load one of our clapped out trucks with 2 guitars, 4 guns, a bottle of whiskey, an old ratty topi hide to sleep on next to the fire… but no pots or pans or food. I think of the eve of my wedding with Corbs as my best man, dangling our feet in the rancid waters of Beirut’s harbour at 3:00 in the morning talking about life, marriage, futures, kids. I think of the two day train ride through the swamps of Western Tanzania to do the incredibly ludicrous Ugalla River trip, where we basically paddled for a week through an unmoving swamp of papyrus and mosquitoes. I remember at the tiny Tabora airstrip where he pasted a bumper sticker on some signboard that said “Skateboarding is not a crime.” If you ever end up there go check it out and then have a beer at “The Civet Hotel”. Corbett would highly approve. </p>
<p>And the oddities…I remember the way he looked when his mouth burned with chillies. The mischievous laugh. The music. Always a country song to sing together. The way he loved deep fried eggs by the side of the road and we’d eat some skinny chicken and he’s declare it was actually a pied crow fried in cattle dung. I remember his appreciation for the finer things in life. He loved to use the word ‘exquisite’. I remember him showing up at my house in the early days on his motorbike and bragging that he had not slept in the same place for more than 2 nights for the whole month. And that in his duffel bag, he only had one change of clothes but 4 different belts. He was the only guide I knew who would lead a walking safari wearing cowboy boots. And then the more serious side of him, the incredibly intelligent man, the ambitious one, the long conversations being there for each other when we were down, happy, sad, angry. </p>
<p>But of all things, I will not miss our crazy trips together the most. I will not miss sharing a beer and singing old Texas songs in Tanzania and the absurdity of it all (or rightly proper, dammit!) the most. What I will miss the most is the constant presence. The daily little SMSs, the little notes, quips, comments. Him being such a constant part of life that made it so much better, richer, funnier, more inspiring. I think he had that impact on a lot of people – making people be bold, courageous, all-out. Hardly a day went by that no matter where we were, we would drop a note, a laugh or express a worry, bad news, good news. Just noticing something and wanting to tell Corbett about it, so we could laugh together. My last SMS last week from Corbett was fitting: “Go get the Dwight Yoakam sings Buck Owens CD. It’s a moral imperative.” Of course it is!</p>
<p>If you entered a room of people, you would know he was there. Some could be intimidated by his presence, others would gravitate towards him, but all would notice his unique energy, the intensity that so many people comment on in these recent stories about him. He was a genius and a crazy man! He loved Luca and Ella so much and would do anything for them. He was a self proclaimed “bibliophile” devouring biographies of James Madison and then heading out to hunt a buffalo. He was a real pain in the neck to debate, because he was quick tongued, relentless and just too smart. But he knew his faults and admitted them. Not many people do that. He was honest, brutally, with himself, with others. He would tell you straight up, whether you liked it or not. He honoured loyalty and valued integrity above all else. If you did something for him, if you were there for him in a hard patch, he’d call you up and say what it meant to him. </p>
<p>In Ella and Luca I see the intelligence, fire, inquisitiveness and creativity of Corbett living on. As Corbett loved to quote: “The road goes on forever…”</p>

	<p>Now that I have kids I am reacquainted with the personas of popular story book characters, and all I can think about when I reflect on Corbett is Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. He would bound into your life at the most unexpected times, knock you down with his huge and positive energy, and give you a big, infectious grin. </p>
<p>I remember during our final year at Colby coming home to my apartment on North Street, unlocking the door, and unexpectedly finding Corbett on my couch with that huge grin, eating a bowl of cereal and listening to my new Beastie Boys tape. He had climbed through a window and over a balcony to break in in apparent search of food and company, and was suddenly in my life. His breaking and entry led to an extended jam session with guitars and bongos, one of the countless of such times. </p>
<p>Fast forward to five years ago when Corbett showed up in New York City (where I was living) shortly before my first son was born. It was an emotional time for me, about to become a dad, and Corbett and I spent a long evening out along with other cherished friends. I could scarcely believe I was hanging out with Corbett again, and we spent hours talking and catching up on his life in Africa, and mine. He also gave me tons of fatherly advice and encouragement throughout the night with that same infectious grin and true caring spirit. </p>
<p>The last time I saw him was at the end of that evening, when we shared a cab back to Brooklyn and I can&#8217;t even remember where he was going, but he gave me a mad grin and wave as the cab pulled down Court Street in the rain. </p>
<p>I was fascinated with the life Corbett chose, impressed that he had built a family and a vibrant business so far away from the safe confines of our earlier years, and I always meant to get to Africa to see him and his life. Like others perhaps, I will always regret not doing this now. </p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t find many people who were more alive in every way, and also so caring and loyal to their friends and loved ones. I simply can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s gone. </p>
<p>May you rest in peace Corbett and may God bless and keep you and your family. </p>
<p>Chris Chamberlain</p>

	<p>I was deeply saddened to hear of Corbet&#8217;s untimely passing. I have fond memories of his typewriter collection, hardcore shows in the basement of the Watermellon, and hanging out with him and Doug Morrione in Seattle. </p>
<p>Corbet lived his life to the fullest and this is something that comforts me.</p>

	<p>We are sad to learn this news of Corbet. Although we did not know Corbet, hearing proud stories from his parents and their buddies have always inspired us.  We dreamed of an adventure in Africa with him at the helm.  Deepest sympathy to all family and friends.</p>

	<p>I remember Corbett fondly from childhood and am so sorry for his family to hear about what happened.  I know from experience that unexpected death is so hard to fathom, and grieving is a long, hard process.   I pray for Corbett and especially his family, to find peace and joy one day in his memory.</p>

	<p>It was very easy to live vicariously through Corbett, Cindy always had exciting stories to keep my family abreast of his truly unique life.<br />
I loved browsing his website and amidst his busy world he would reply to my petty inquiries with humor and interest.<br />
There are no answers as to why someone who made such an impact on so many is gone. Clearly, his life will be celebrated and remembered everyday. My heart breaks for his family and beautiful children. These pictures on the website say so much. Say hi to Forrester up there Corbett. You will be sorely missed. Stacey</p>

	<p>Corbett was just one of those larger than life characters that made an enormous impression on me in the 15 days spent with him in the bush.  I&#8217;ve stayed in touch with him via e-mail over the years and even met him in Santa Fe once several years ago on his way through to promote his business.  It&#8217;s a surprise even to me that I felt so close to someone I only spent 2 weeks with years ago, but a friend told me yesterday:  &#8220;I figure a day in Africa with someone is more like a week with most people.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that analogy, I spent the equivalent of 15 straight weeks with Corbett and for anyone that knew him, he was simply one of those individuals that burn into your mind and psyche.  He lived every minute of his life to the fullest, was passionate beyond measure about Africa and all of its inhabitants, and made a lasting impact in Tanzania and East Africa in general through his extensive conservation work there.  Truly a person to admire and learn from even though his life was cut short at 38.  I am quite saddened by his death, but so thankful we did cross paths for a short time in that heaven on earth that is Africa.</p>
<p>This is my cheers to Corbett and don&#8217;t forget to make the most of every day!!</p>
<p>Jon</p>

	<p>I feel sad that I really didn&#8217;t get to know Corbett, better. I know I missed out on a hell of a guy.. I got the chance to visit with him over the last few month&#8217;s.Corbett wanted me to build him a Bludworth Cue. We spoke of it a few times. I felt honored being commisioned by Corbett to build his cue. I was looking forward to delivering it to him later this years or next.  I have begun seasoning the woods, [  from Africa], the cue is under way, and I,  will build the &#8220;CORBETT CUE&#8221;, within a few month&#8217;s. When completed I will pass it on to Cuz.</p>
<p> Corbett,    Out going personalty, lots of fun, wantd me and Suzanne to come over in the fall, or next spring. Our prayers go out to his family, and his mom, Cindy, my sweet cousin.<br />
We love ya Cuz.<br />
Leonard and Suzanne Bludworth</p>

	<p>This passing is a little too much to take after Beth&#8217;s death last year.<br />
After looking at the pictures and seeing what a great life he was living, it is hard to believe that skinny little kid with the inhaler and breathing machine named Beano grew up to live and work in Africa.<br />
His son is the mirror image of the Beano when he was a kid.<br />
My heart and prayers go out to Cindy, David and the rest of the crew.</p>

	<p>wow, where do I start? Corbett and I both ran complimentary safari businesses in Tanzania, and I really enjoyed hanging out with CB when I came through Arusha. We always had a beer (or two?) when I had a night or two back in Arusha when I was in between safaris, and he always was trying to get me to move to Arusha to hang out on a more permanent basis. I guess he needed to feel like he was surrounded by more Texans. 🙂</p>
<p>Corbett was extraordinarily gifted in so many ways, and always knew what to say and when. And he knew how to make friends with people in a hurry. I was never able to make it to his legendary gigs, unfortunately. Bad timing, I guess.</p>
<p>Corbett, I am just one of many that will miss you. You were a good friend, and somebody I always looked up to. You had passion coming out of your ears, and a way of living life to the fullest. I feels weird to write a note that I know won&#8217;t be replied to.</p>
<p>Cindy and David, please know that Corbett touched so many lives, and the notes on this page only represent a small amount of toughts and feelings about him. My fingers aren&#8217;t typing out the feelings that I have, but suffice to say that Corbett was a great friend and colleague. I will miss him dearly.</p>

	<p>Jay and I are stunned and devastated by the loss of Corbett.  Such a neat kid and fine young man!  He always acted genuinely happy to see us when we would run into him.  I can see his engaging smile and sparkling eyes.  Through the years at ease with adults and kids alike.  Just a precious person.  On April 27 we were watching his video and Jay said, &#8220;We need to sign up with Corbett for a safari next year.&#8221;  Doesn&#8217;t seem possible that this has happened.</p>
<p>Cindy and David and everyone close to him, we are so sorry and send you our love and prayers.</p>

	<p>Corbett,<br />
We came to Africa in grief at the loss of our brother and father Darren. Over the five months I was there you opened up your heart and home to our family. </p>
<p>You taught us about the reality of Africa and guided us safely on our journey. Without your support we would have been lost in an untame land, we may not have finished our brothers project; a childrens&#8217; village in Arusha. </p>
<p>We had good times, great discussions and some serious discussion. We played many gigs together and I saw an intense musician, and a delicate artist&#8230; shifting between characters. </p>
<p>You are a larger than life Corbett, playing the staring role in many varied scripts. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy we got to talk on the phone the day before you died. I&#8217;m happy we told you we love you. </p>
<p>I appreciate you were there to listen. I appreciate you caring for our cause. I appreciate you understood what I was going through in Africa. I appreciate you opening up and showing a very sensitive side. A poet hidden deep within a strong warrior. </p>
<p>I hope your music and poetry is beamed across the globe immortalising your spirit in many ears.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t remember the last time I saw Corbett. It was probably in Maine during our last spring at Colby in 1993. I moved to China soon after, and he went to Africa. We exchanged a few notes over the years and then lost touch as life pulled us in different directions. We finally reconnected by e-mail late last year and I&#8217;m sorry I never had the chance to hear more about his life and adventures since college or to visit him in Africa. Corbett was a remarkable person and I consider myself lucky to have known him. Rest in peace, my friend.</p>

	<p>Corbett was a good man, an excellent shot and sportsman and a great father and son.  His death at such a young age is tragic, but it&#8217;s amazing, and inspiring, that he was able to do and experience more in four decades than most would only dream of accomplishing in twice that time.  His quote that he had a lot &#8220;invested&#8221; in Africa is an understatement.  His African life was his raison d&#8217; etre, and he was as committed to it as if it were his native home, a Texas ex-pat bound to Africa as only Hemingway could explain. He will be dearly missed, but never forgotten.</p>

	<p>Corbett, I remember as a child growing up in the early 70&#8217;s.  We were a very tight nit family group taking care of each others children&#8211;Cindy, Charline, Frank &#8211; Judy, Fred and Walter.  Those were years of high energy and lots of crazy-ness. Through the bonding compassion of love and awarness , we became one family taking care of each others children whenever the moment arrived.</p>
<p>May his spirit always prevail in the wind traveling across Africa and into the hearts of all those who new him so well. </p>
<p>My prayers of love and compassion reach out to you Cindy and David, to his wife and to his children and all those who new him so well.</p>
<p>Corbett&#8217;s memory, I will carry within my heart. </p>
<p>I send my love to you</p>

	<p>As will everyone whose life he touched, Nancy and I will miss Corbett greatly. Doug and Corbett came to Colby together in 1989, along with Michael Kolp, Chris Sharpe, Chris Chamberlain, Bree Jeppson, Sue Furlong, Andy Wright, and others who formed a tight circle of friends who continued to support each other. But Corbett was Corbett and he and Doug formed a special bond I think, one that encouraged Corbett to be himself (not that he ever needed much encouragement) and to express himself in wonderful, though at times unconventional ways—all the time knowing that his friends would still be there and love him. </p>
<p>Like the time that he and Michael lobbied Colby’s president successfully to allow them to live in “alternative housing.” I’m pretty sure that the president had no idea that Corbett planned to live in a yurt all year long—on a hill in back of his house.  That’s what they did, that is until one evening when Corbett said that things slowly got brighter and brighter when he was reading some dense philosophy book. It turned out that the added illumination came not from new understanding and newly installed kerosene lamps, but rather from the yurt’s canvass roof, which their wood stove had managed to ignite. No one was hurt and after the fire engines left, driving across the president’s lawn, the College instituted a new housing policy that was less supportive of such alternative proposals. The point is Corbett was always a path breaker, someone who got done what others only thought about trying. And, he often managed to do it with refreshing flare.	</p>
<p>Corbett had a great laugh, an utterly genuine way of smiling, and an incredibly sharp sense of humor. When others might be inclined to throw up their hands in exasperation at human folly, he excelled in finding the humor in it. Just one more short story—</p>
<p>Corbett got interested in our project to build a house on an island in a lake near Colby. One late January day he agreed to help me transport three, 4-foot long granite curb sections over the lake to the island house site. I couldn’t quite figure a way to get them there and Corbett suggested toboggans. Great idea—that is until we got onto the ice, which was like glass. Zero traction for us to pull them and no way to steer them once any momentum got built up. We dissolved in laughter that lasted for well over the hour that it took us to make the trip—we pushed, pulled, yanked, and shoved the toboggans and sent them zig-zagging in random directions like possessed curling stones.  For years after that whenever we met we’d crack up recalling the images of ourselves engaged with abandon in that reckless folly. The lesson? For me it was Corbett’s unhesitating exuberance at engaging a new experience with his typical, “we can do that” attitude. That’s a lesson that I think many of us who knew him learned from Corbett.</p>
<p>My very deepest sympathy to Corbett’s family. He will be deeply and sadly missed by all of us.</p>

	<p>My daughter Blair was the first person to call and tell me about Corbett. I could barely understand her through her crying. When I was able to comprehend exactly what she was saying, a surreal numbness came over me and I could only sit there in disbelief.</p>
<p>The very first thought I had was running alongside a small river next to the dance hall in Luckenbach, Texas looking for Corbett who we all thought had been washed down stream, never to be seen again. Finally, we went up to the hall and there to our surprise was Corbett, sitting on a stool, talking to Hondo. I think Corbett was around two.</p>
<p>By ther way, I&#8217;m not sure, but I think I photographed that boy more than any kid in my career. He had a terrific smile.</p>

	<p>Knowing Corbett was a privilege.  I have rich and durable memories of time spent together riding snow at Sugarloaf – Corbett sporting a sling from the previous session’s crash – playing music “to take the paint off by” in the finest basements in Maine, debating the causes of the American Civil War, and learning the hard way during EMT training how not to start an IV drip line.</p>
<p>I learned a great deal from Corbett.  I learned Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote works beyond those featured in the Iron Maiden song “Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner” and that a human being can subsist a surprisingly long time on rice and beans, and iterations thereof.  I also learned life is something to be lived fully, and loved unconditionally and unapologetically.  </p>
<p>The last time I saw Corbett was at Belson’s wedding at New York City in 2000.  Corbett, Matt and I gathered at Matt’s hotel suite just before zero hour to toast the groom and suit up.  We accomplished the first task handily, but soon realized only Matt actually know how to properly don a tuxedo.  I’ll never forget watching Matt spend his final moments as a bachelor dress Corbett in formal attire while nervous members of the wedding party huddled outside the door of the suite and Johnny Cash roared from the stereo.</p>
<p>I will miss Corbett terribly and will doubtless think about the things we won’t do, chief among them sit on a porch somewhere between the Colorado Rockies and East Africa, guitars and glasses in hand, and watch our children play.  I expect, however, he would discourage dwelling on what isn’t and instead wish to celebrate what is, so I will look for Corbett in the next rising sun, the next sweet note, the next good day afield.</p>
<p>Peace to you and to yours, my friend.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to think of one story to share about amazing Corbett, and I am struggling. There are so many, and so many moments that would suggest the wonder of Corbett and the fortune I feel to have shared a small part of his life. The last time I saw Corbett was in London, just a few days before the birth of Luca. The excitement, pride, and sparkle in his eyes were just spectacular. Like all moments with Corbett, his passion seeped through him and was contagious. It was obviously a most significant moment for Corbett as father-to-be, and for us, witnesses ,so therefore somehow, mystically and magically, consumed with his joy. I can only say I am tremendously lucky to have been touched briefly by his life. He will remain an inspiration to me, in every way. My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his family.</p>

	<p>My Mom (Jane Tate), sister (Kristin) &amp; my best friend since 1st grade, (Jessica Benyon Burritt) have shared incredible stories of their safaris and good times with Corbett over the past few years.  I will always remember our wonderful childhood memories growing up with Corbett in West U, and my heart goes out to Cindy.  Cindy ~ I always look forward to seeing you and hearing all of the amazing stories of your son.  How very much Corbett is loved!  I hope to see you soon, Cindy, and see pictures &amp; hear more Corbett adventures.  Sending love, Macey</p>

	<p>It has been a long while since I have seen Corbett – too long, to be sure. But like many, Corbett left an indelible impression on me from the time we first met. No doubt, he was single-handedly responsible for opening my eyes to a whole new world of interests when we met early on at Colby. He was always marching to a different beat and I was always glad to join him. I cannot count the adventures we had, most often around rock climbing…so many times, he would swing by with a backpack full of gear and boundless enthusiasm. Off we would go in a relentless pursuit of fun.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we re-connected by email not long ago and shared updates on our families/lives. I&#8217;m glad he followed his passions. I’ll miss his his passion for adventure, his philosophizing, his infectious grin, and his always fantastic tales.</p>
<p>On belay, old friend.</p>

	<p>As with many others, it has been many years since I last spent time with Corbett. His passing leaves me saddened, but I can&#8217;t suppress a smile at the recollection of old memories.</p>
<p>He grew wheat grass and hung a heavy punching bag in the basement of our house on North Street, his room replete with cherished souvenirs from his already impressive travels. The late night jam sessions, quotations from literature I still haven&#8217;t read, and escapades in the twilight hours that aren&#8217;t fit for print.</p>
<p>He surfed with the ironworkers in Bath, in winter, as that&#8217;s when the waves were up. Traveling to and fro in an old Cherokee, that classic grin emanating from behind the wheel. </p>
<p>My thoughts are with you old friend.</p>

	<p>I knew Corbett from Pershing Middle School.  He was the sweetest and funniest boy I knew.  He always kept us entertained in class and never a dull moment. He was definitely an unforgetable person.  I remember asking my mom if we could go buy the bluebell ice cream because Corbett was on the box!  Loved that smile!  My prayers are with all his family and friends.   Beth</p>

	<p>I am so touched by this beautiful website.  It is evident that Corbett had such a beautiful soul, beautiful relationships, and a beautiful life.  Corbett is and always will be an inspiration to many.  </p>
<p>Follow your dreams, your passions, and everything else will fall into place.</p>
<p>I have many fond childhood memories of Corbett, but my favorite memory was from Lake Travis approx 23 years ago.  Corbett was probably 12 and I 8-   we went snake hunting &#8211; even then, he was drawn to the &#8220;wild&#8221;.  We successfully found a snake, and Corbett chopped his head off and we watched the tail squirm in delight.  What fun.</p>
<p>You will be missed by many.</p>

	<p>I was so sad to hear of Corbett&#8217;s passing just this afternoon.  What a fine, crazy man the world has lost.  I remember watching him eat a whole shallot, raw, delirious after 24 straight hours of travel from Africa.  I remember wandering the Maine woods at night, and promises to drop whatever we were doing the moment the first snow fell.  I remember the way he insisted on living at the edge and climbing on the bridge buttress as the train passed over head, just because he could.  I remember the moment the drive shaft dropped off the bottom of the jeep in the middle of nowhere, Tenessee.  And I will never forget his jubilant, tireless aliveness and passion.  Go well, The Bishop.</p>

	<p>A memory I frequently revisit.  It must have been 1986.  Corbett and I decided to feed the ducks at Hermann Park.  It was quite late at night.  We walked out near the pond, where we were surrounded by sleeping ducks.  We had popcorn, or breadcrumbs.  Suddenly the ducks awoke.  From complete silence to an amazing, overpowering quacking frenzy.  I must have looked afraid, because Corbett looked at me and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, really, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;  Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Earlier today I received a phone call from a friend in another state.  We exchanged greetings, and she said, &#8220;I just cannot get over this about Corbett.&#8221;  It seems that a lot of people are feeling that as well.</p>

	<p>Lovely Corbett.  So sad on hearing this awful news.  In thinking of him, I am reminded that he seemed to always know who he was &#8211; and he was very good at being that.  You will be missed&#8230;</p>

	<p>We will miss Corbett. He guided our family on an incredible trip to Tanzania in the summer of 2007.  While my son and I climbed Kili with Corbett&#8217;s friend, Marc Baker, Corbett guided my wife and daughter on an equestrian safari that is one of the great memories of their lives.<br />
We are so sad.</p>

	<p>I brought a jar of &#8220;DREAMLAND&#8221;  B-B-Q SAUCE to Arusha. Allan Philemon and I went to the butchery and showed the butcher how to cut the ribs we wanted to smoke. We concocted a smoker out of a metal trunk, a steel grate, and a few pieces of corrugated metal. The guys thought this mzungu was nuts for asking them to soak the wood thoroughly prior to building the fire. </p>
<p>Corbett dropped by. Allan and I had already opened  the bottle of Glenlivet. We commenced to tell stories, laugh and &#8220;sip&#8221; as the ribs smoked and we had to constantly remind the guys not  to let a flame touch the ribs. A few hours later we pulled them off the rigged smoker, slathered them with the imported sauce and enjoyed the finest rack of southern smoked pork ribs ever enjoyed on the African continent .</p>
<p>An awesome memory of two Southern boys and an African friend. Now I&#8217;m back in &#8220;Sweet Home Alabama&#8221;  dealing with the shocking news that CB has left us. I&#8217;ll hang onto the memories for the rest of life.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s truly sad to hear that about Corbett&#8217;s passing.  You don&#8217;t get to spend time with too many people as unique as him in your life.  The past couple of days have brought back a ton of memories.  One that sticks out is repelling off the Foss balcony with Corbett.  I jumped off first thinking I would fall about 2 feet before the rope would stop me.  Instead I hear wood breaking and I keep falling another 5 feet.  I suddenly stop, look up to see Corbett&#8217;s head stick out over the edge &#8211; &#8220;Bill, shit quick grab the column.&#8221; He then proceeded to lower me down the remaining 40 ft.  We were both shaking and spent the rest of the day up to other miscious to calm our nerves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been too long Corbett.  I&#8217;ll tip a glass to you tonight.  RIP and deepest sympathies to his children and family.</p>

	<p>I spent just a short time with Corbett and have never forgotten his kindness and that way of his that let me know that he knew he was vulnerable because of it.  I so appreciated the respect he showed to his gun bearers, trackers, spotters, and to the other guides.  He easily and readily deferred to them at times, and never seemed to feel less a man for doing it, as some might.</p>
<p>I recall one night of our Safari (it was still pretty early in the evening), he led us onto a grassy plain and pointed to a particular tree and a watering hole in the distance. The closer we got the quieter he became, and I suspected something special was in store.  And it was.  I glanced over at him and he was grinning ear to ear, welcoming us to our home for the night.   Up we went, past the almost but not quite hidden toilet perched on lower branches, on up to finally scramble atop the black tarp,  the African heavens above and the water hole just beyond and below us.  Of course, it was spectacular.  The entire top of the gardenia tree had been flattened and laced up as tightly as a woman&#8217;s girdle by Corbett and his team.  Up came our evening&#8217;s repast complete with cocktails, I loved that Corbett liked his Jack almost as much as I liked my Tangeray, and we drank and dined and whispered as elephants played throughout the warm African night.</p>
<p>How does a kid from Texas become a safari guide in Africa?  I know he had a lot of support and encouragement from close family and dear friends, but even with all that, not many would have dreamed it and continued to dream it until he actually lived it.   And along the way he made others believe their dreams too could become reality.   What a wondrous gift to bestow.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to have had a chance to spend a small bit of time with him.  Whether talking Texan drawl or African Swahili or a musical language born of many worlds, Corbett was a lovely, lovely man.</p>

	<p>Terribly shocking and sad, sad news.  My deepest condolences to Corbett’s family. </p>
<p>I haven’t seen or spoken with Corbett since our freshman year at Lamar high school. We too lost touch even as our lives went in similar directions and we shared many of the same passions. I’m sorry that we didn&#8217;t stay in touch and that I didn’t continue to know him all these years.  What a great man and father. What a great life.</p>

	<p>I was shocked and saddened when I heard the news about Corbett going to the other side at an age when most of us are just beginning to really have the courage to live life on our own terms. However, I must say that it is only a special soul that was Corbett to have an honor like this. I do not know one other person who touched so many people in so short of time, who really helped make the world a better place and was lucky enough to also left an incredible legacy, Ol Tukai Conservancy and his two beautiful kids, Luca and Ella.</p>
<p>My wife Cate and I were lucky enough to have ventured on the most incredible Safari of a lifetime back in 2000. Corbett made our dreams and adventures come true everyday in the most effortless manner. Infact, when I got onto the plane to leave Corbett&#8217;s beloved Tanzanian Bush, tears welled up through my heart to my eyes all as a result of what Corbett had made possible for us to experience.   He was a true professional and one of the finest young men I ever had the pleasure of knowing. </p>
<p>We can all learn from Corbett, his integrity, wisdom, big heart, good humour and his true spirit for life will live on forever.</p>

	<p>We are both too stunned and saddened to write much now. We not only spend a wonderful safari with Corbett, but joined the Board of Ol Tukai and helped Corbett raise money for the cause.<br />
We met his sweet children in Arush and hosted them in NYC.<br />
So sad<br />
our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family<br />

	<p>I am so very sad to hear about Corbetts death. I met him in 2004 while on a fact finding mission with the Annenberg foundation in Tanzania. Corbett was so exuberant and so much fun that our whole crew loved him. In 2006b I went to Kenya as I wanted to do a documentry on Independent spirits, basically characters who are doing works that have a positive impact on the world or peoples lives. I emailed Corbett and he was wonderful at setting me up with emails of people I should connect with. He was also super encouraging which I really appreciated.<br />
To his children- I lost my father and I know how hard it is but if I learnt something from him its that if you can encourage someone, even if you hardly know them, you must. Your father was a lovey man who lived his life to the fullest, whle always being kind to people. The world needs more people like him. I so sorry for your loss.</p>

	<p>I knew Corbett in High School.  Even back then he always had such a great outlook and energy.  We lost track after high school, but I was always hearing things about him here and there over the years and everytime I would hear an &#8220;update&#8221; all I could say was wow.  </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of seeing africa for myself yet, but its on my &#8220;bucket list&#8221;.  I knew Corbett was there and I had always thought that if I ever made it over there I would have liked to see him again and let him show me his Africa.  I&#8217;m so sorry to hear that I&#8217;ll not have that opportunity.  </p>
<p>My deepest  and most sincere condolences to his family.</p>

	<p>Hell-Ride </p>
<p>From Drew Sudduth – childhood friend</p>
<p>This story came to me all of a sudden while thinking back on my memories of Corbett Bishop. It’s pretty silly but it always makes me laugh just thinking about it. I figured that it might be worth sharing since in my mind it encapsulates a part of Corbett&#8217;s spirit. The amazing thing is that, for each one or two of these crazy stories we all have, Corbett must have had hundreds since he inspired everyone around him to follow him on his adventures. Like a lot of people, I always assumed I would follow him to Africa one day.</p>
<p>I can’t place the date and the details are rusty but it must have been my junior or senior year in high school &#8211; 1987/88 time frame. I remember that he just showed up at my house one day and knocked on the door. Corbett was on his skateboard and he was wondering if I wanted to join him. I had retired from skateboarding in the third grade but he somehow talked me into dusting off my old 70’s era skateboard and hitting the street. I lived around the corner from Rice Stadium so we meandered over there without any particular plan in mind.</p>
<p>My recollection is that we just sort of found ourselves at the top of the long ramp that takes the players down onto the football field. What luck – we didn’t know what we were looking for but this seemed to fit the bill &#8211; a halfway decent challenge anyway. We both just looked at each other and smiled. We shoved off and slowly started down the ramp but, within seconds, I for one was reconsidering my decision. It didn’t look that steep from the top but as we picked up speed I realized that I couldn’t stop and I was in for a hell-ride whether I liked it or not. If I said we were going 60 miles an hour and there were flames shooting out of the back I don’t think I would be exaggerating. It is a miracle that I stayed on the whole way down but, after breaking the sound barrier, our eyes got even bigger when we saw the speed bump at the bottom – this was not part of the plan. We both hit the bottom at the same time and went catapulting out onto the Astroturf – barely missing the goal post and somersaulting end-over-end until finally stopping at about the 30-yard line. After a long silence, with bruises and burns from the Astroturf all over us, we just started laughing and laughing. </p>
<p>Declaring a Pyrrhic victory and with somewhat stunned looks on our faces, we trudged our bruised and battered frames back up the ramp. No…  we didn’t go back down the ramp. We’re not that stupid. We were both done for the day and I think that was the last time I was ever on a skateboard. Corbett didn’t stop though and he went on looking for adventure until he found Kilimanjaro. Looking back, this seemingly inconsequential encounter with Corbett turned into probably one of the wildest rides of my life. Sometimes I cringe a little when I think about careening through the air onto the field- we both could have gotten decently hurt – but I still brag about it whenever I am at Rice Stadium. I’m just glad he decided to knock on my door and take me with him. I would love to be able to ask Corbett about his recollection of that day &#8211; probably just another day in the life for him.</p>

	<p>I just got this news a few minutes ago and still I am in shock and thinking about the loss of our dear Beth almost a year ago. What a coincidence and such a loss of two young and aspiring assertive individuals who lived life relentlessly and successfully. I remember Corbett at the age of 4 and how high spirited he was. I always loved hearing stories from his mom about his new life on Africa. Cindy was so proud. I always thought he was a gem then and now . This is a sad and tender moment. I raise a toast to his existence and contribution in this universe and mine. May the force be with you, Corbett and family.</p>

	<p>My wife, Nancy, and I met Corbett when he helped guide a NatGeo trip on the northern Tanzania route (Ngorogoro and Serengeti). A great guy and lots of fun; I had hoped to catch up with him at least once more.</p>
<p>&#8216;I see the bright lights of Memphis and the Commodore Hotel&#8217;</p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t imagine Corbett not being &#8220;Alive&#8221;. It was what he exuded. I remember him living in a tepee at college one year. All I could think was that he was addle-pated to even consider such an ordeal, but he was living an adventure. I always admired his confidence and joie de vivre. His slide show when he first came back from Africa was as impressive as his ability to reach the people to whom he was exhibiting it. He was so incredibly outgoing; it was always he that made the effort to reach out to those as curmudgeonly as I.<br />
He was a blessing to all of us. He will be remembered.<br />
Love you, Corbett.<br />
Enjoyed having you here.<br />
Take care.<br />
Bruce</p>

	<p>I did not come to Lamar from Pershing, Lanier or River Oaks Baptist.  I went into a new high school without any of my middle school or neighborhood friends &#8230; I was a 14 year old nervous wreck.  Before my Freshman year started I went to a 2 week summer school program and Corbett was the 1st person I met.   He introduced me to his friends &#8230; Sarah, Mica, Blake, etc. and really made me feel welcome.  </p>
<p>For lunch, during one of those summer school days, he invited me to walk from Lamar to Beck&#8217;s Prime for lunch.  It had only been open for a few weeks, if not days. I was scared to death that we would get lost, get in trouble, return for class, but for Corbett it was just getting lunch.</p>
<p>I never thanked him, but he was my first impression of of my high school classmates  and he gave me the confidence that all HS freshman want and need to get through those years.</p>
<p>Let me also say that one of the funniest moments in HS was watching Corbett climb out of Ms. Noble&#8217;s Biology class 1st floor window, during class, only to walk back into class a few minutes later &#8211; Ms. Noble never skipped a beat as she read the daily outline off of the blackboard.  In Corbett&#8217;s defense, it was a boring class and he was just trying to give it &#8220;some energy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Corbett, it&#8217;s a credit to you that you will be so greatly missed by so many people on two different continents and your children are fortunate to have had such a wonderful role model and influence as their father.  God bless you and your family.</p>

	<p>I am shocked and saddened to hear of Corbett&#8217;s untimely and sudden death, and I wish to express here to his wife and children my deepest condolences.<br />
I went on a safari with him many years ago, and afterwards, some of our group went on to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.  I stayed behind, and Corbett offered to take me for an extra three full days to another national park, where we saw many animals, and got stuck in the mud several times!  He was so kind, and generous of his time.  I am forever grateful to him.  He made my trip memorable.</p>

	<p>I am shocked and saddened that we have lost such a fun and free spirit. The world is certainly that much darker with his death-but then it is so much brighter for his having lived.<br />
Corbett organised and guided us through the East African trip of a lifetime in 2000. We had always hoped to do it again with our children-but we waited too long. Corbett-you will be very missed and will always have a place in our hearts.</p>

	<p>I was shocked to read this email of Corbett&#8217;s death. My deep and heart felt condolensces go out to his family and his dear Mom who introduced me to Corbett. Although I have never met Corbett personally, we met and exchanged ideas over the internet as I too work in Africa, South Africa. I have been trying to get to Tanzania to see his beautiful work and witness the lovely images he would send me of Tanzania. I have thought of him much within this landscape and have shared the images with friends. I am really sad to hear this news. I wish I could attend the Memorial Service.</p>

	<p>Corbett- where do I possibly start writing about out friendship-our relationship- it would take a book-our times together and our love for the African bush-how could such a relationship end, a relationship that had its ups and downs like any? </p>
<p>It seems so ridiculous that it cannot go on!</p>
<p>I met you all those years ago with David and Cindy as one of your guides on that first safari and remember you jumping off a landrover to help a Maaasai woman carry her load of firewood. I gave you a slide of that incident and I hope it can be posted by who ever has it now. You returned and lived at lake Eyasi with the other guides on that trip. You climbed mighty mountains in Africa and eslewhere &#8211; hunted Cape buffalo-played Little Feat music and had a wicked sence of humour! You even worked for me! We shared many a bush walk, a sometimes less than lighthearted meal in my old camp as we jointly entertained but always  challenged the camp visitors! </p>
<p>I look back on all this with real fondness and a sence of we should had been doing all that again at Ol Tukai! </p>
<p>Jesus man!</p>
<p>My thoughts go to your family now and I send them all my love and a thank you for Corbett who changed my life! He will always be a friend in my heart no matter what anyone else may think!</p>
<p>I will miss you man and will constantly reflect on all the great times we spent together.<br />
I will do that most days for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>HMMM that&#8217;s some of the first things going thru my mind, Corbet, always so full of energie dead ?<br />
i could&#8217;t believe it, i&#8217;m in europe for a little bit, coming back to Arusha will be strange, there will be no Corbet to go and visit, i&#8217;m gonna miss that so much, i didn&#8217;t think that it was time for Corbet yet, for me he was one of the guys who&#8217;d live for ever, crawl out on the savanna in the age of 116 to just take out another buffolo and afterwards take the guitar play Cocain Blues (Johnny Cash) while having a Btl of JD, he still will but only in our memories</p>

	<p>Elaine and I traveled to Africa with friends in 2005. Corbett was our guide on our National Geographic trip through Tanzania. He made the Serengeti a fabulously interesting and exciting adventure. He also made the trip a stress free experience. It ranks as the best trip of my life. Thanks to Corbett, I have a life long love of Africa and its incredible beauty.Sadly I was planning a return trip that I hoped Corbett would guide. His untimely death effects people all over the planet, but his legacy lives in all those he touched.</p>

	<p>Ellen and I share the unfathomable sense of loss with everyone  who has shared the world of Corbett Bishop.  We had the good fortune to know him as he was completing high school and about to enter his collegiate years.  As the Colby College alumnus with whom he interviewed, it was easy to see how he could be a wonderful addition to the Colby community.   And indeed he was.  I can never forget the time he sat in our living room as we discussed his interest in going to Colby.</p>
<p>Sometimes people leave this world after having made it a better place than they found it.  There can be no denying that Corbett Bishop achieved just that.  What a wonderful legacy he leaves for all of us.</p>
<p>There was a beautful feature story on Corbett in Colby Magazine in the recent past.  We were thrilled and indeed proud that we had some role, even if minor, in his life.  I e-mailed him in Tanzania to congratulate him on the great story but more importantly on the magnificent work he was doing.  He responded with a warm e-mail inviting us, of course, to come share his experience.</p>
<p>Our love and sympathies to everyone.</p>
<p>Ellen and Lewis Krinsky<br />

	<p>The news were really shocking. Who would have thought that happen to Corbett. The Alfthan family (as Corbett used to call us) will always remember Corbett for his unwavering energy and spirit and deep knowledge of the African bush and fauna. We had the benefit of joining his suberb safaris on two occasions and also camping with him in his beloved Ol Tukai. That was just before his  great lodge project was completed, which  he sadly won&#8217;t be able to enjoy any more.<br />
With our deepest sympathies to Corbett&#8217;s family. </p>

	<p>It is always sad to lose a family member. I didn&#8217;t know Corbett, but I know his grandmother, Bernice, and knew his grandfather, Dwight.  We were in the same unit in WWII and became POWs in the Battle of the Bulge.  It is from Dwight and Bernice that I can see the adventurous life planted in Corbett.  My sympathy to the family, and wishes of God&#8217;s blessings.</p>

	<p>My husband Woody and I met Corbett in Tanzania on safari with Natl Geographic in 2006. I will always remember standing with him in the vehicle as we bounced across the Serengeti, wind in our faces and wild things on our minds. I am grateful to have met Corbett and to have the inspiration his full-out spirit gave to live fully in the moment. We only have this one day.<br />
My sympathy to his family in Texas and his family in Africa, especially the people of Ol Tukai, who have lost a great friend.</p>

	<p>What a wonderful and adventurous life Corbett had. We know how proud Mote and Jeannie were of him. We have enjoyed so many years of being close to your family, watching Billy Ray and Cindy grow up, and then of course watching Corbett grow throughout the years. Our thoughts and prayers are with your family. </p>

	<p>Cindy and David, </p>
<p>How my heart hurts at hearing this news.  My mind wanders back to the old days in West U. of soccer games and the times when Brannin and Corbett would play &#8220;soldier&#8221; in the neighborhood in full camo attire.  What a delight he was to know then and what a treasure of memories he has given to all who<br />
have known him.  Brannin&#8217;s sister, Lollie, remembers that Corbett was the only one of &#8220;the boys&#8221; that didn&#8217;t mind including her<br />
in their activities.  He would even make sure<br />
she had full &#8220;camo&#8221; face paint so she would fit right in.  Sounds like his sense ofcompassion and adventure were always part of who he was and who is was to become.</p>
<p>Know that you and his precious children will<br />
be in our prayers.</p>
<p>Vicki</p>

	<p>Corbett is my soul brother for life. I first met W.C. at colby college in 1989. as part of a crew of fun loving eccentrics, Corbett and I understood in each other an exploratory passion for life, creation, and taking the road untraveled whenever possible. I remember passing cannisters of ether around and reciting lord Byron or hunter Thompson. I remember writing mad poetry with him on the walls of the campus simply because it had to be done.  I remember climbing skyscraper cranes in Seattle and dangling off the edge, smoking and drinking and laughing. I remember climbing peaks and challenging the gods. I remember old willie dixon or skip James records with a jug of cheap red wine.  I remember being on top of mt. Shasta under a full moon with him and discussing the possibilities of eternity as it might relate to a can of tuna fish. Roofriding on jake ulich&#8217;s volvo through the back highways of central Maine. road trips to Colorado and everywhere else. Corbett, as many here have mentioned, had a blend of intensity and silly simpleness that is all too rare. He could explain the universe, make you understand it, and then laugh it off with a little song or poem.  as a poet, Corbett always challenged and inspired me to take my craft further.  a year and a half ago we reconnected over e-mail when I was in brazil. I had planned to visit Tanzania in October. I heard from him just two weeks ago, and in the past few months our friendship and mutual understanding was gaining another layer. He literally helped me stay alive during some difficult times. he understood a dark  oblivion. he understood joy and mother life even more. brother, I will miss your words and thoughts. I am so thankful we reconnected these last couple of years.  as we all know , you were one of kind.  you made life better, plain and simple.I am lucky to be able to sit here and have all these memories.   Love ya brother,   I am proud to call you a friend. Peace.</p>

	<p>A shock, obviously.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me two days to decompress, after first hearing the news.</p>
<p>Other people here have already posted their eulogies, in words far more eloquent than mine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to keep my comments brief, then. And in a light vein. Knowing Corbett as I did, I think he would have appreciated it that way. In the brief time that I knew him, he was not one to stand on bogus ceremony. He was one of the least pretentious people I have known. And funny. Funny as they come.</p>
<p>I first met Corbett on the overnight KLM flight back to Amsterdam from Kili. Heaven knows what kind of intervention made him my seatmate that night, but it did. I&#8217;m a quite flyer — I work a high-pressure, high-profile job back in the world, and the last thing I want is to socialize on a plane with someone I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>He was gregarious, though — funny and friendly to a fault. Something about him put me completely at ease. Those of you who knew him well know all too well what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a journalist by profession. I cover the entertainment industry for a chain of newspapers in a big media company — though not so big as it used to be. Corbett got to talking movies, Africa, mountain climbing, Into Thin Air, Jon Krakauer, Africa, Daniel Pearl, his years living in my neighbor city of Seattle, Africa again, Myles Turner, the war in Iraq, the movie Blackhawk Down, his kids, his in-laws&#8217; place on the Indian Ocean, dangerous Somalis, not-so-dangerous Somalis, African officials of the customs variety, DVDs, books,  Outside magazine,  Sebastian Junger, Peter Beard, Kuki Gallmann, Iain Douglas-Hamilton and Saba Douglas-Hamilton, Robert Redford&#8217;s performance in Out of Africa (not good), Michael Douglas&#8217; performance in The Ghost and The Darkness (even worse) good writers, terrible writers, so-so writers, phony writers, poseurs, IMAX films, climbing Kili, his adventures on Mt. Denali in my back yard, his taking clients up Kili, the Kili IMAX film he did location work for and how the future of Africa lies with its women. &#8220;The men are useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had been on a camping safari with a local company in Arusha, and I had seen the migration. I was chuffed. Never mind, that Corbett said: &#8220;You must see my Africa. Let me show you around.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he did. Ninety-nine times out of 100, nothing ever comes of a conversation like that. Two years later, over Christmas, he took me on a modest, sleep-&amp;-camp as you are outing to his conservancies at Ol Tukai and Loliondo. We laughed. Boy did we laugh. At a buffet dinner at Lake Manyara lodge, he peered at a wasted-looking dude about to plant himself face-first into the salad bar and said, &#8220;That guy looks like Harvey Keitel gone wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our trip got funnier, and madder. The migration had already gone through Loliondo, and there was nothing up there but poachers&#8217; snares, a crippled wildebeest that he had to put down — it had torn loose from a snare, but was stranded behind the migration — and Richard Estes. Estes is the famous writer of East African guides to animals. He passed us on what local authorities with a finely honed sense of irony call a &#8220;road.&#8221; &#8220;You say you had lions at the camp?&#8221; Corbett asked Estes through the driver window. &#8220;No,&#8221; Estes said. &#8220;Lions IN the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversations around the campfire at night — many of you reading this know the ritual well —  took on a life of their own. Corbett had a witty remark for just about everyone and everything. Nothing was off-limits. We were alone in the wilderness, and yet I&#8217;ve never felt life more full.</p>
<p>Only Corbett could talk about a famous cheetah researcher &#8211; whose name shall go unmentioned &#8211; and then say the guy was bone lazy: He wanted a diurnal animal, &#8220;but he was deathly afraid of elephants.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Klein&#8217;s Camp, Serengeti, we had a prearranged pick-up in a bush plane, first thing in the morning. &#8220;Here comes your plane,&#8221; Corbett said, squinting at the horizon.  The plane appeared, went into a landing, aborted the landing about three feet off the ground, screamed into an upward dive and narrowly missed clipping a buffalo skull stashed in a tree. &#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; Corbett said, as the plane barely made it over the treeline, rose into the sky, banked and came in for another try. (It wasn&#8217;t our plane, as it turned out.)  &#8220;An industrial grade bozo,&#8221; Corbett said of the pilot, perhaps charitably. </p>
<p>So many stories, so many good times.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you already know Corbett well and have your own fond memories of him. I&#8217;m still getting over the shock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave it, then, with a couple of quotes I rather like, which I think appropriate to the occasion. Corbett would be horrified. Too pretentious, he might say.  Sure, but deep down, I think he would appreciate it.</p>
<p>First, a light-hearted quote, which I think sums Corbett up perfectly. It comes from  Peter Hathaway Capstick, the (late) great white hunter and an absurdly underappreciated writer. I don&#8217;t know if Corbett and Capstick ever got together. They would have made a fine pair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Capstick said once, after a close call with a &#8220;buff,&#8221; as he liked to call that particular species. &#8220;Live and learn. It sure beats the alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now the more serious, and (I would like to think) more poetic quotes.</p>
<p>Harry Emerson Fosdick: &#8220;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than live in a world so small that my mind could apprehend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seems to fit Corbett to a &#8216;T.&#8217;</p>
<p>And this, from the poet Dryden:</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy the man, and happy he is alone,<br />
He who can call today his own.<br />
He who, secure within, can say,<br />
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.<br />
Come fair or foul or rain or shine,<br />
The joys I have possessed in spite of fate are mine:<br />
Not Heav&#8217;n itself over the past hath power,<br />
What hath been hath been,<br />
And I have had my hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good luck, Corbett, wherever you are. I shall never forget you.</p>

	<p>Corbett and I were in choir together at Lamar.  I didn&#8217;t get to know him very well, but the memories that I have are his passion about music, his smiling eyes, and his soufulness.  He seemed to have found a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; calling early in life.  After reading  the guesbook entries, I wish I&#8217;d known him better.  What a remarkable man.  Thanks for making the world a better place, Corbett.  My deepest sympathy to his family and to his friends.</p>

	<p>Corbett, I&#8217;m so sorry you are gone, your voice and actions and their impact on the world will be missed by everyone who knew you and many who never did.  I haven&#8217;t seen you in years, but you always encouraged me to push myself, reevaluate and have fun, and your untimely death reminds me to to that and more.  We are all better from having known you, and not many have made such a contribution to the world, especially in such a short life.  I will always remember you and try to be a bit more like you every day.  Emily</p>

	<p>Corbett,<br />
I&#8217;ll always think of you as that beautiful child with the squeaky voice who grew into a man that accomplished thinks I could only dream of. Your life was a bright flash of light that illuminated the dark corners of peoples lives all around the world. It was a honor to have known you.<br />
Cindy,<br />
I&#8217;m sitting here, on Mothers day, thinking of you. If I had one wish it would be to have something I could say to ease the pain of a mother that has lost her child, but I know there are no such magic words.<br />
All my love.<br />

	<p>Corbett,</p>
<p>A favorite of my daugher&#8217;s books begins:</p>
<p>We all went on safari<br />
When the day had just begun<br />
We spied a lonely leopard<br />
Arusha counted one</p>
<p>For all the obvious reasons, this book makes me think of you. The Maasai are on every page which teaches about Tanzania and how to count to ten in Swahili. </p>
<p>Still, I have certain memories of you:<br />
&#8211; Passing out after a powder day at Sugarloaf, spilling chocolate milk on Matilda&#8217;s back seat<br />
&#8211; Playing mandolin to an Irish drinking song you wrote and we played in the basement of the Watermelon along with Kales, Egg, Tim and Matt Barr during the one and only gig of our thrash/metal/whatever band (can anyone remember our name?)<br />
&#8211; Speaking in some sort of pseudo-British accent at Belson&#8217;s wedding; I thought you were recalling Spinal Tap  and responded in kind, but later figured out that it was authentic, the voice you found in Africe</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a legand, my friend. I hope that some one of our friends writes a book on your life in Africa (Belson maybe?). It would be an inspiration to us all.</p>
<p>And so my daughter&#8217;s book ends:</p>
<p>We all went on safari<br />
By the sunset&#8217;s fading light<br />
We built ourselves a campfire<br />
And bid our friends goodnight</p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p>
<p>-Scott</p>

	<p>David and Cindy,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terribly sorry to hear about your loss. While I didn&#8217;t get a chance to know him well, I will never forget LuLu&#8217;s stories with Corbett from the bush. I will also remember the time I met Corbett in London in 2003, along with Luca and Camilla. I remember his stories and being amazed about how cool of a life he and his family lived.</p>
<p>It sounds like he touched and positively affected many lives. Like Richie said, he was fortunate to find his true passion in life, especially at such an early age.</p>
<p>My thoughts and prayers will be with you in the coming days. </p>
<p>Jason Hill</p>

	<p>Corbett<br />
I haven&#8217;t seen you since you were fourteen years of age. Henry Adams once said:&#8221;A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.&#8221; I was your Spanish tutor @ Pershing and you accompanied my group to France in the summer of 1985. Well, you affected my eternity with your &#8220;joie de vivre&#8221; All of us remember that  last day in Paris when Corbett fell off the fire escape from the second storey of the hotel trying to impress a girl. We rushed him to the  hospital and they operated on you and put you on the guerney on our outbound flight. I remember you telling me&#8221;when I was falling through the glass, I realized how foolish I was&#8221; You were so happy in France. You had a smile that lit up a room. You had a personality that magnetized us all. I read about you in the papers and was so proud to hear that you found your calling and you were fulfilling your dreams. I am so saddened to know that your life was cut short. but I rejoice in knowing that you lived life abundantly. There is a french saying that goes like this&#8221;La vie est un bien perdu quand on n&#8217;a pas vecu comme on l&#8217;aurait voulu.&#8221; Life is a lost gift if one does not live the way one wanted to. You will be missed. You have touched our eternity. Rest in peace Corbett. My sympathies to all your loved ones. Bernadette Aboud Redano</p>

	<p>It has been a long time since I&#8217;ve seen my friend Corbett.  Whether it was on the lacrosse field or in choir (&#8220;Corbet did it!&#8221;) or always fearing for my life just a little bit anytime we went anywhere in his old Suburban, Corbett was always himself, always looking for the big adventure and happy to let his friends share in the joy that comes with that quest.  For all of his antics and the occasional trouble he found himself in, Corbett Lived.  Thank you, friend, for being there to remind us to live.  My prayers are with your family and your children.</p>

	<p>Cindy and David,</p>
<p>I have no words to make this day any better for you both. I never knew Corbett even though I may have seen him at one of those old Art Director&#8217;s functions and not known who he belonged to at the time. I am sorry I never met him. He was evidendly a great kid and a great person. Time moves so quickly as we get older and alot of the old memories fade. I think of all the old art directors, illustrators, designers, photographers and such from the past and remember the great and not so great times. I wish for you to remember the great times you had with Corbett and the wonderful life he had, even as short as it was. Please accept my condolences.<br />
James Stevens</p>

	<p>I did not know Corbett well – just the occasional nod or a quick &#8216;hi&#8217; in the hallways of Lamar.  Although, I had long been intrigued by him from afar.  Had I know then what I know about him now, and how similar our tastes in literature were, I would have made a point to know him better – yet another reminder as to how short life really is.  </p>
<p>I have a fleeting memory of Corbett and his mother.  The memory is fuzzy, but the feeling I derived from seeing them together is not.  I remember seeing them and stopping dead in my tracks to think, ‘wow, there walks two old graceful souls’.  How remarkable Cindy struck me &#8211; so mother earth with a quiet strength and grace.  Corbett with his wry smile, sun kissed hair, and forever the twinkling eyes.  I have no idea what they were speaking of – or even if they had been talking at all.  But I still, to this very day, remember that feeling of grace and calm, and my longing to know where they had gotten it from and if I could, for just one moment, have a little piece of it for myself.</p>
<p>I have a son of my own now, and I wish for him all that Corbett became.  They say the true measure of a man is that of the accomplishments and friendships he made while alive.  If the memories posted here are any indication I would say he truly was a remarkable man, father, friend, and son.</p>
<p>Godspeed dear Corbett Godspeed.</p>

	<p>The first thing that came to mind was how one of the Heck children referred to Corbett as Carpet. His leaving so soon is such a tragedy. It makes him even more of a larger-than-life legend.</p>

	<p>Corbett Bishop created a strong connection to Africa for me in his tales and experiences and even in teaching me a few useful Swahili phrases. And I will always remember $1 pints of Konyagi that make you lose your motor skills way before you feel the buzz.</p>
<p>When I met Corbett in Tanzania, I asked him what urged him to live in Africa. His solemn answer to me was that &#8220;Animals tend to be more honorable than men.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t that he was telling me of his disregard for humanity, but rather the great passion he had for Africa&#8217;s beauty. </p>
<p>I only know a few other people in my life who have left their homeland to find the place of their dreams. But there has only been one who has brought so many others over to share those experiences with him. Corbett, you will be sorely missed by many.</p>

	<p>Though I was a year behind Corbett&#8217;s graduating class at Lamar, I was ahead in my science and math, so I was lucky to have a couple of classes with Corbett.  In those classes, Corbett and I shared many stories about our love of traveling the world.  I grew up in Mauritius, an island SE of Africa.  He always got a hoot out of calling me a Mauritian; he thought it was funny since it kinda sounded like he was calling me a martian. That was the silly side of Corbett.  He would always ask me questions about growing up there, so it wasn&#8217;t surprising that after making a trip to Africa himself, that one day, he would live there himself, and during his lifetime there, he was able to influence so many lives locally and internationally.  His free spirit and his love for people and nature will be sorely missed.  Those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Corbett are truly blessed.</p>

	<p>Dear Corbett , family &amp; friends of Corbett,<br />
Thank you so very much for allowing our son Patrick to live and work with you in Tanzania for 9 months last year. It was the best experience of his life. He told us he loved you as a brother and is so devastated with grief &amp; regret that you have died. Please help him through this. He told us he still had so much more to learn from you. He had tremendous respect for you and all you have accomplished in Tanzania. His bags are packed and he is ready to go back in June and wants very much to continue on with your work and legacy there. I know you were soulmates with a deep love of nature, animals &amp; the love living life outdoors and sharing that passion with others who appreciated it as well. Pictures of you and your children and friends have been flashing on Patrick&#8217;s computer here at home and I treasure watching them and feeling as if I was there with you. I regret that we never met and that the only words I heard you say were, tell you son to take a bath. He has been bathing in his tears of sadness knowing you have gone on your next adventure before he was ready for you to go. He is comforted by his belief that you are not alone, but have joined your dear family and friends who have gone before and were there waitng for you and that he too will join you again on safari someday.  In the meantime please know how much we thank you and appreciate all you did while you were here on earth.<br />
Much love &amp; gratitude,<br />
Virginia Fleming</p>

	<p>Regretfully, I was never able to go on safari with Corbett, but hosted him to family and friends one evening in San Antonio several years ago. His enthusiasm for the natural world was an inspiration that hopefully his children will carry on, for we all know that due to people like Corbett, who paid intense attention to nature, then told of his experiences, that such stories will help improve our planet&#8217;s chance for survival.  Corbett, may your joy and excitement and concern for the natural world be transmitted to many more people through often told stories of yours.</p>

	<p>Cindy and David,</p>
<p>What a beautiful service for Corbett.  I loved the song Corbett wrote!  I hope it will be recorded soon by the friends that sang and played it.  I&#8217;ll always think of him when I hear Roy R. sing &#8220;Happy Trails To You.&#8221;  So sweet.  </p>
<p>We wish you a soft landing, Corbett, like you wrote of in one of your poems.  We will miss your bear hugs&#8230; until we meet again.</p>
<p>Love, Carol and Jay</p>

	<p>I still cannot get over the news of the death of Corbett, especially considering that it was not a long while ago that he called me and with the ever present enthusiasm in his voice, informed me that he planned to come to Uganda, and could we meet?</p>
<p>I first met Corbett in the fall of 1991.  We were both freshmen at Colby College.  I was from Africa, and he was from Texas and one would have been forgiven for thinking that two people with absolutely nothing in common could not be got anywhere..  It was Jesse Salisbury, my roommate, who introduced us, and it is an image of Corbett from that first meeting that ha endured for me since.  Both he and Jesse were seated on the ground when I approached them and when Jesse did the honors, Corbett got up, wiped his right hand on the seat of his hands, checked to make sure it was clean, and then gave me a firm handshake!  I was to see him do it many more times, but it is that first time for me that defines Corbett.  He made you feel worthy!</p>
<p>Corbett&#8217;s interest in Africa was apparent even then.  During visits to my room, or conversations at meal times, he always inevitably steered the conversation to Africa.  And after so many &#8220;daft&#8221; questions I had been asked about Africa, it was a great relief to meet someone with whom I could have an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; conversation about Africa.  Once, he asked me what I thought of colonialism and whether I felt proud of our independence and I said, &#8220;independence from what?  Not only our countries were colonized but our minds as well and we have never been able to free our minds.  Go read &#8216;Petals of Blood'&#8221;.  The fact is I was young then and I was a radical, and Ngugi&#8217;s petals of Blood was my time&#8217;s Fanon&#8217;s Wretched of the Earth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did not think Corbett would take me up on that dare and never thought much about it until about a week later when I was playing intramural soccer for my house and Corbett who had come to watch begun cheering me on as Shakespeare everytime I had the ball.  We had a good laugh about it later and I remember thinking to myself., &#8220;Jesus, and I always thought Petals was only serious stuff!&#8221;  But that was Corbett.  He always found something worth a good laugh in any situation.</p>
<p>One day, about a month into my time in Colby, I stopped by Corbett&#8217;s room on my way back from the library.  He was watching the Rockets play the Bulls and while everthing think basketball then was about &#8216;being like Mike, I knew nothing about the Rockets, leave alone Olajuwon.  So when Corbett asked me which team I wanted to win and I said the Bulls he looked at me with mock horror (I realized only later) and said &#8220;oh, get out of here&#8221;.  I, in turn was horrified by his rudeness and with a burning face, got out of his room.  I really felt so bad then that when Jesse came in later he asked me whet the matter was.  I told him I did not think I wnated to be friends with Corbett any more because he had told me to get out of his room just because I supported the Bulls.  Jesse burst out laughing, because, as it turned out he had also stopped by Corbett&#8217;s room and had found Corbett puzzled by the rude way I had left his room without even a polite good night!  We all went back to Corbett&#8217;s room and had a good laugh and I never again took offense from anybody unless I first cleared with Jesse or Corbett.  But because of that simple incident, Corbett and I moved from the polite realm of acquaintances to the carefree world of friends.  That friendship endured, even after we left Colby and went our separate ways.</p>
<p>The good ones die young, so we say in Africa, and Corbett was good.  I only wish, Corbett, that you had stayed a little longer!</p>
<p>Farewell, my friend.</p>
<p>Ken (Shakespeare)</p>

	<p>We are very sorry to hear the news about Corbett.  As my husband Dan said in an earlier message we shared a magical time with our very good friends Cate and Steve Wyatt and we all wanted to go back and bring our children there to share Corbett&#8217;s passion and vision of adventure.  I will miss him.. we shared e mails after the trip.. He was a man who understood silence and the soul.  Our hearts go out to his wife and family.<br />

	<p>I have a clear memory of sitting behind Corbett in 7th grade Texas History at Pershing, wondering if this boy with the constant smile ever sat still for a moment. After many years of not knowing him, I can tell from the memories of his friends and family, he never did! I missed out on an incredible man and am thankful for being able to have experienced that energy for alittle while when I was young. My heart is with his friends and family and my hope is that his smile and exuberence lives on in his kids, his memory and in his mission in Africa.<br />

	<p>The bright daylight of an African afternoon must surely be dim at the passing of such an incredible soul.  Here in Atlanta, Georgia; Dan &amp; I are shocked and profoundly saddened by the early passing of Corbett.  He created, lead, inspired every single person he met and was a life spirit who blazed a new trail every day.</p>
<p>He planned the most wonderful Safari for David Shaheen&#8217;s Fabulous 50 in June of 2006.  17 of us were guests on this amazing journey planned by Corbett.  He planned and executed the most incredible Safari &#8212;- we will NEVER forget our time in Tanzania and the inspiring CORBETT BISHOP!</p>

	<p>I didn’t know Corbett Bishop, the man.  I knew “Beano”, a scruffy little boy with a dirty face that was always happy, content to ride in the back of his mother’s little brown car with Shanda (his dog) and his mom – up front – racing through Montrose.</p>

	<p>We were part of the Shaheen Party of 2006;  a magical mystery tour of epic fun, laughter, adventure, and awakenings, organized and led by Corbett.<br />
What a passionate gift Corbett gave to the world.  His love and enthusiasm for Africa opened all our eyes to the gloriously sublime world of Tanzania.  His smile and charm combined with his knowledge and understanding created a world-class guide.  He leaves behind a large footprint that outlines and defines a man who made a difference to those he inspired on safari and to the people and land of Tanzania.   He touched so many.<br />
Thank you Corbett.</p>

	<p>Cindy, as I listened to those wonderful tributes to Corbett on Monday afternoon, I heard more than a little of you in each of them. </p>
<p>David, having a 10 year old myself, I can imagine what it must have been like taking one on of that age. And as “radical” as he was without your help, I don’t see that you slowed him down any.  </p>
<p>I didn’t know Corbett, but I do think I know why he turned out to be such a wonderful person. All his friends are grateful to you, I am sure.</p>

	<p>Corbett and I had the rare distinction of not only being two Texas kids who found themselves in the far reaches of Maine for our freshman year at Colby College, but we even hailed from the same senior class at Lamar High School.  In high school, Corbett was known as a true and kind friend, an adventure seeker and master mischief maker.  He was someone who knew, as most of us didn&#8217;t at the time, that there was something bigger out there waiting for all of us, that life would and should be about revelation and risk.</p>
<p>At Colby, Corbett seemed to find his element, taking to the beauty and wildness of the surroundings in a way that was instinctive and respectful, presaging in many ways the larger path his life would take as a conservationist and explorer. I can clearly see Corbett on campus, striding across the lawn as I can imagine he later did across the plains of Africa, with a smile and an openness for any experience. Corbett never waited for anything to come to him &#8211; he met the world head on.</p>
<p>Having been to Africa to visit my husband&#8217;s family and birthplace, I understand what drew Corbett there and captivated him.  I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d go back with our two children and meet up with Corbett there, to have him show us his Africa.  I&#8217;m in disbelief that this won&#8217;t ever happen.  </p>
<p>His mother is such a wonderful, gifted person.  I hope it can be comforting that her son did not live a resigned life or a muffled life or a withheld life &#8211; and that he did not keep it to himself but shared it absolutely with the world.  But I&#8217;m sure she, as his mother, knew from his earliest years that he never would.</p>

	<p>The summer of 2006 is a benchmark in my life.  It is the summer I quit doing what everyone else thought I should do, and started doing what I wanted to do.  It is the summer I moved to Africa to work for Corbett.</p>
<p>I arrived in late May and Corbett picked me up in Namanga to drive me to Arusha.  I was very clean, and my hair was blown dry.  The lenses of my sunglasses were shiny and my fingernails met my mother’s standards.</p>
<p>We hopped in the little Nissan Patrol Corbett had arranged for me to drive for the summer, and drove out of Namanga, into the wide open space of Northern Tanzania.  Before too long Corbett veered to the side of the road and stopped.</p>
<p>“Alright, Garvs.  Your turn!”  And then he chuckled.</p>
<p>I did not know how to drive stick shift, let alone do so on the wrong side of the road, and on the wrong side of the car.  We switched seats and I looked over at him for my first set of instructions.</p>
<p>He had already reclined the passenger seat to full extension.  His legs were crossed, boots kicked up on the dash, and he was opening up some biography to read.  I wouldn’t be receiving any instruction.</p>
<p>I knew enough about standard transmission from driving around in the Rice University parking lot with my father when I was younger, so I was able to at least turn over the engine.  For the next four or so hours, much longer than the journey should have taken, I stalled, choked, screeched, and cursed my way to Arusha.</p>
<p>I only hit one donkey and didn’t do too much damage.</p>
<p>Over that summer Corbett continued to challenge me.  He forced me to fight for myself and to survive.  He taught me to love the mud and the dung and the dirt.  He made me practice driving across the Korongo to sharpen my driving skills.  Sadly I think I inherited some of his habits.  But I’m proud of that.  He drove with purpose.</p>
<p>In mid-August I packed my duffle to go home.  He drove me back to Namanga.  I was a different girl.  I held back my tears when he hugged me goodbye, then I wept on the road back to Nairobi.</p>
<p>My mother and sister picked me up at the airport when I arrived home.  I think my mother almost had a panic attack when she saw me.  My long hair was in knots, uncontrollable.  My skin was brown and my clothes were packed with Africa.  Don’t even get her started on my fingernails.  I bet I smelled good too.</p>
<p>But I was free, and I was a better, happier person.</p>
<p>I have countless memories from that summer.  Corbett’s mischievous nature and solid spirit were contagious.  He took me under his wing and showed me how to have a good time.</p>
<p>That is what I will always remember about him – he truly knew how to have a good time.</p>
<p>As my mother would say, Corbett had just the right amount of twinkle in his eye.  I believe he has passed a little bit of that on to everyone he has touched, and I see that very same twinkle in the eyes of his dear Luca and Ellabeast.</p>
<p>Corbett – I love you and I will miss you always, every day.</p>

	<p>Dear Cindy,</p>
<p>Please know how much Scott and I have been thinking of you these past days. </p>
<p>As a mother, I can&#8217;t begin to imagine your pain.  Also as a mother, I know how proud you must be to have created a son filled with a sensitive spirit, incredible love for adventure, and passion for life. It is so wonderful to get to know Corbett through this site, thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>Please know we are thinking of you.</p>

	<p>Outcomes</p>
<p>Hoping means something but </p>
<p>Trying means more</p>
<p>Doing is everything</p>
<p>Wishing means nothing</p>
<p>Things are what they are</p>
<p>Corbett was a doer.  I’m proud to have been his cousin and friend.<br />
He made my life richer with many experiences here and abroad. Some were scary and others were quite fun. He was a true adventurer who always tested my pluckiness when I was with him. I still thank my stars that he lost at rock, paper scissors when we thought we had discovered a croc skull on the opposite side of the Grumeti River. He had to wade across to the other side, bitching and moaning the entire way, and was chased by a water buffalo only to discover that the skull was only a piece of petrified wood! Then he had to wade back across! I have never laughed so hard. Later, that night after supper we returned to the scene and with flashlights and saw dozens of sets of croc eyes in the water.<br />
We both became very queasy and I don’t think he ever forgave me.<br />
I hope all is forgiven now.</p>
<p>My love and thoughts go out to our family.</p>

	<p>Hey, so Corbett was always a role model. My parents were very close with his parents. I&#8217;m quite a bit younger. Anyways, he was awesome, and I still can&#8217;t comprehend that he&#8217;s gone. He had a great smile, and he was just a great all around man. Here&#8217;s to you Corbett, here&#8217;s to you.<br />

	<p>Anyone who met Corbett soon understood that he was a person they would remember for the rest of their lives.  He was brilliant, interesting, funny, impossibly stubborn at times, and exciting and fun to be with.  Corbett was very good at giving one a reason to remember, often quite quickly.  For me, this moment occurred when we were eighteen and took the form of a roundhouse right hand that came flying through the air after I foolishly made an irreverent  remark about Texas.  I managed  to get out of the way,  quickly retracted the comment, and we were fast friends from that point forward. </p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about being friends with Corbett.  One thing is for sure.  There was never  a dull moment.  Ever.  Our second year in college we rented a house in Waterville (from my parents) and four of us were the first men ever let off-campus to live as sophomores.   We were a sophisticated group and dove in to our new living situation.  Corbett took over the kitchen, whipping up whatever  came to mind, including enormous vats of chili with WAY too many Habeneros tossed in.  Corbett had spent the summer in Africa and was initiated into the Mengati tribe, with scarification along his belly and an unbelievable audio recording to prove it.  The anthropology department  caught wind of his adventure and was drooling over the possibility of a thesis.  Corbett politely told them to forget it.  As he put it, “I’m not going to study my friends.” Corbett loved to read and seemed to have read everything under the sun, and could talk about it for hours.  A small part of my education in college occurred in the classroom.  The bulk of my education came from sitting around kitchen tables debating everything in the universe with Corbett and David.  If I was reading Kerouac, Corbett told me to read Celine.  If I mentioned Jimi Hendrix, he handed me an album with Billy Gibbons.  The guy really knew his stuff.  A teacher of his once admonished his use of a split infinitive in front of his classmates.  Corbett let them know his use of the split infinitive was purposeful and was so irate he returned the following day with a 100 line sonnet of split infinitives, read it, and tossed it to the professor in disgust.  I can only think of the Star Trek one, to boldly go where no man has gone before.  Corbett did that, too.</p>
<p>He returned from Africa with dozens of items including spears, a bow and arrow, machetes and shields.  He gave us all this really cool stuff that we would never have found on our own in a million years.  We were psyched, and felt a bit warrior-like, ourselves.  These items, unfortunately all contained a fair amount of un-cured leather, and our house soon smelled like the worst parts of a horse-barn.  It’s also not a great idea to have a lot of weapons in your house in college, even if they’re old-school.  I came home one night and found a new tapestry hanging over the south wall of the living room.  We had recently discussed toning down the wanton destruction our living quarters for my sake as the landlord, and I couldn’t help noticing the overdone placid looks and politicians smiles coming from the crew.  It was an hour and a couple of beers later, having completely forgotten the tapestry, that I leaned against the south wall and the tapestry came down, revealing dozens of HOLES in the wall, varying sizes, running the length of the paneling.  Corbett quickly took responsibility, citing the need for safety when training folks on proper spear throwing and the use of the East African bow and arrow.  The largest hole, our friend Chris took credit for, having used a motorcycle helmet and his head.  I was angry, but it was damn hard to stay that way.  Corbett always had a way of charming his way out of something, and in this case, I think I was charged with the righteous indignation to even assume there could be a better venue for training warriors in Waterville, Maine than our own living room.  The other reason it was tough to get pissed off at Corbett was that anyone who spent time with him soon realized that for an aspiring mountaineer, the man was a total klutz.</p>
<p>I can’t count the times I was in another room and heard something shatter, followed by a pained “Corbett!”  Anything breakable was fair game when he was around.  His Klutzdom extended to all situations and machinery.  He’s the only person I know who drove two different cars into two different houses.  Dave’s car was one of them. Corbett once explained to that me he destroyed the basement door at 265 Main Street putting on his boot.  Even his dog, Sparky, was a klutz.  In one particularly tough winter month his dog broke its leg, the pipes burst in his house, and he hit black ice and crashed the Ford LTD station wagon.  I’m pretty sure there isn’t a rental company in the southwest that would let him drive off their lot with a vehicle.  At times, the man was straight out of a country song.  And he would want it no other way.</p>
<p>If things broke from time to time around Corbett it was because he was always pushing it. Whether it was bicycle racing, surfing, skateboarding, rock climbing, mountain climbing, hunting, guiding, paragliding, snowboarding, writing music or playing the guitar and mandolin, he gave it everything he had and his enthusiasm was infectious and inspiring.   Corbett saw challenges as the best way to truly engage life and he never shied away from them.  His confident and resourceful nature, along with a great wit and the best sense of humor serves us all as a great example.</p>
<p>He was a charming gentleman, a loyal friend, a loving father and I was so lucky to know him.  Our memories of him will never fade and whenever faced with challenge or a new experience in life we can draw on our memories of Corbett and be inspired.  He was truly one of a kind.</p>

	<p>As I&#8217;m sure everyone else has done, I sat here in front of my computer reading others&#8217; comments, remembering Corbett, crying and laughing at the same time&#8230;.    I remember both the clown and the friend who had a way of remembering things, and making each person feel special. </p>
<p>Valerie&#8217;s memory of 7th grade Texas History reminded me of an early Corbett hijinx&#8230; I sat near Corbett as well &#8211; we were probably in alphabetical order &#8211; Bishop, Bone, Bricker&#8230;  Our teacher was unpleasant, and yelled, a lot.   We were about to take a test, but I still remember the atmosphere in the classroom being pretty damn rowdy and loud.  Corbett sat at his desk launching his pencil  &#8211; just a few inches in the air &#8211; with a rubber band and trying to catch it.  Until temptation got the best of him. Mrs. Price started her demands as she passed out the tests, &#8220;Put away your books!  Clear your desks!  Quiet down!  You only need one pencil, everything else needs to be put away!&#8221;   After a few minutes, the room got quiet as everyone got started, except for Corbett, who was sitting straight up in his desk, hands folded on top of his paper.  He had his closed-lipped smile on his face.  I sat at my desk, trying very hard not to laugh out loud, because I knew why he wasn&#8217;t doing his test&#8230; Seeing him sitting there smiling, looking a bit like Jeff Spicolli, Mrs. Price sighed hard, knowing there was a story to be heard.  She walked over to where we sat, and asked as quietly as a frustrated woman could,  &#8220;Corbett, why haven&#8217;t you started your test?&#8221;  &#8220;I don&#8217;t have my pencil.&#8221; Almost afraid to ask, she said, &#8220;Corbett, where is your pencil?&#8221; Corbett, still smiling his smile, very simply pointed up above his head.  He&#8217;d shot the pencil up into the ceiling tile, where it stuck.  She looked up at the ceiling,  saw the pencil,  frowned, clicked her tongue, and then said, &#8220;Boy!&#8221;  She walked over to her desk to get him a pencil and was heading back to hand it to him , when his dropped out of the ceiling, bounced off of his desk, and landed on the floor beside us.  He sat back up and said, &#8220;Never mind!  I found my pencil!&#8221;  Couldn&#8217;t help it -we cracked up.  </p>
<p>Another thing I thought of was the time that Corbett and other people from school got to go be guest DJs at a radio station &#8211; maybe KRBE ?- anyway, definitely top 40/ pop.  I saw him in the hall at school the day before the night he was going, and told him to have fun and good luck at the radio station, and he patted me on the head and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll play &#8220;Bitchin&#8217; Camaro&#8221; for you, OK?&#8221;</p>
<p>Heaven will be a lot more fun now&#8230;..</p>

	<p>I met Corbett whilst on a family holiday in Tanzania. His passion and deep knowledge of Tanzania, Ol Tukai, and all things wildlife made me want to return to work with him. In 2007 I travelled back to Tanzania to work on an environmental project in Ol Tukai &#8211; Corbett , always open to new ideas, welcomed me with open arms to work alongside him. I will never forget the passion and enthusiasm he brought to everything he did &#8211; whether it was going on a game drive, playing his music, or having a drink with his friends Thomas and Lars in Queens Bar, Arusha . I am truly shocked and saddened that you left us so early in life, Corbett, but your memory will live on in all of us. Thanks again for giving me such an opportunity in Tanzania, and I will never forget it.<br />

	<p>I have very found memories from my childhood of spending time around Cindy, David, and Corbett.  Corbett was about ten years older than me so I was old enough to remember seeing him as a male cheerleader in highschool.  I never realized that males could be cheerleaders until that moment.   i thought it was weird but he seem so excited.   I think he was the first boy I had a crush on that actually tried to talk to me. He was always so friendly and interested in the lives of my sister Megan and I.   He had quite an impact on my life when I was a rebellious teenager and I will never forget him.  My heart goes out to Cindy, David, Camila and the kids.  I am so sorry for your loss.</p>

	<p>David and Cindy,</p>
<p>You guys are definitely in my prayers. I did not know Corbett, but felt like I knew him from the many, many wonderful stories that LuLu had with him.  What fabulous trips she had with all of you.  He really lived the dream that so many of us would like to do.   Love to you both,<br />

	<p>Dear Cindy and David,</p>
<p>My thoughts have been with you over the last two weeks. I cannot imagine the pain and feeling of senseless loss that you must be going through. It is only now that I have begun to reflect consciously on what has passed, and even still the picture refuses to come in to focus for me.</p>
<p>My life both in Africa, and even before that, has in so many ways paralleled that of Corbett&#8217;s. Raised since I was two by Mum and step-father, came to Africa as a wide-eyed 18 year old, took over from Corbett as Kilimanjaro Mountain Guide, safari guiding, running Oliver&#8217;s Camp with Paul, conservation work, married here, children, and finally neighbours for the last few years. We spent so much time together on safari with each other&#8217;s guests, and our goal of enjoying the bush with both lightness and seriousness in equal measure was our uniting passion.</p>
<p>We have laughed and sparred (literally in some cases with our epees) over Sunday lunch, shared great food and even better wine, spent days in the bush with the kids and afternoons in the sparkling waters of Momella. We were alike in so many respects, but so different in others.</p>
<p>Cindy, you came to our wedding in Tarangire all those years ago. Corbett herded a group of barely controllable Masai warriors during the service by the swollen river, and then later, after they had eaten too much goat and drunk too many Safari Lagers, he scooped them up and drove them back to their village through the velvet black African night. For so many years that I knew him he was more Morani than Mzungu. The lightness, sense of fun and thirst for crazy challenges and experiences so perfectly echoes that period of uncensored, responsibility-free carte blanche that a young Masai man enioys. Maybe he just never really could lay that Spear down!</p>
<p>&#8220;If I know a song of Africa, of its cool mornings, giraffes on the plains and the trees in the mountains, does Africa know a song of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This (roughly quoted!) from Out of Africa. It is the endless gnawing feeling with which we struggle. We, who despite feeling profoundly connected with so much of Africa&#8217;s wild land, will never in reality be part of this curious, challenging, rewarding and magnificent continent. But judging from the tributes in this guest book, people out there connected to Corbett, touched by him and inspired by him will all remain with their own songs of Corbett and his Africa. I personally have many songs of Corbett, but will steal this one from Walt Whitman as an elegy for him today. I rediscovered it recently, and i know Corbett knew it well:</p>
<p>Song of Myself</p>
<p>I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self contain’d,<br />
I stand and look at them long and long,<br />
They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br />
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br />
They do not make me sick discussing their duty with god,<br />
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,<br />
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br />
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.</p>
<p>All my love to you and everyone else over there in Houston.</p>
<p>Jo x</p>

	<p>I am absolutely shocked at Corbett&#8217;s sudden passing.  I haven&#8217;t seen him for many years, but do remember his unique personality and the crazy things he used to do.  He shall be missed, my sincere condolences to his family.  God Bless.</p>

	<p>To see East Africa through Corbett&#8217;s eyes is one of the true exotic pleasures of our lives. His passion for and knowledge of the place ran deep &#8211; and he shared it unstintingly. Africa, and Corbett&#8217;s friends and family can ill afford to lose him &#8211; but we have.</p>

	<p>Just returned home from Houston for the Memorial and then S. Texas. I still can not believe that Corbett is not here.  He was such a beautiful and inquisitive child and young man. I remember him lizard hunting on the ranch when he visited Compadres.  Luca so closely resembles him &#8211;  I believe he lives on through those he&#8217;s left behind.  Cindy and David did a fine job rearing Corbett and should be proud that he lived such an amazing life.</p>

	<p>Dear Cindy and David,<br />
We&#8217;ve been thinking of you every day with love and sincere sympathy.<br />
Although didn&#8217;t know Corbett, really, beyond having met him briefly years ago &#8212; we felt like we knew him through your stories and photos.<br />
What an amazing, rich life he lived &#8212; more fulfilling than most of us can even imagine. (Hearing more about him at his memorial service last week impressed this upon us even more.)<br />
We&#8217;ve heard that when a member of an elephant herd dies, the other elephants gather around it and perform a ritual, extending their trunks to touch its tusks. Corbett, of course, would be able to tell us if this is actually true. If it is, perhaps he even saw it happen once or twice.<br />
In any event, our touch goes out to you.</p>

	<p>I was truly saddened to hear of Corbett&#8217;s untimely death.</p>
<p>Corbett helped me back in 2003 when the wreckage of my late father&#8217;s aircraft was eventually found on Kilimanjaro after it crashed 1997. He led a team of climbers to recover what was left and did an amazing job. Not only that, but when I was in Arusha having to handle the bureacracy, funeral arrangements and so on, Corbett was a true friend to me and showed incredible levels of kindness and support. I really appreciated everything he did for me.</p>
<p>Although we hadn&#8217;t been in touch for several years, I often thought of Corbett and the support he showed me. He was a great man.</p>
<p>My thoughts and sympathies are with Corbett&#8217;s family and loved ones during this difficult time.</p>

	<p>I met Corbett about 7 years ago. He impressed me greatly and I am very sad to hear that he has passed on. I wish his wife and children strength and courage and my deepest sympathies. His parting is a great loss for Africa.</p>

	<p>Thinking back and reading over these comments I am crying and smiling at the same time. </p>
<p>Corbett, you continue to be an inspiration to me. Nothing was ever dull with you – I don’t think I ever once saw you bored. Even though I saw you only a few times in the last few years, it was always the same old you, full of stories, curious about how everyone was doing, kind, full of life, and, showing up to meet us at the bar with a wallet full of counterfeit $100 bills. </p>
<p>I remember not that long ago, Doug was trying to convince me to go out to Africa to visit, and I said I wasn’t sure, it was such an unknown place and I was a little nervous. And Doug said, But Corbett’s there – you know he’ll take care of you. And I thought, That’s exactly right. Corbett would (and could) take care of you – he was the person you’d really want in your corner if you were in a tight spot.  It reminded me of a night back in college; a bunch of us were up at a concert in the middle of winter somewhere a few hours north of Colby. It was late, the concert was winding down, and I realized I was out of my asthma inhaler, which was a big problem. Corbett got wind of it and said something like “Hand me your inhaler.” I gave it to him, and he started rubbing it really fast between his hands, and then lit a lighter under it (*don’t try at home), just for a second. He told me to take a puff and it worked. I got two good puffs and that was all I needed. It was typical Corbett in that it helped someone out, was resourceful, and could have resulted in an explosion. </p>
<p>I never made a trip to Africa to visit, but it always made me happy to know that you were out there, living free, and I’ll continue to think of you that way. </p>
<p>I feel very lucky to have known you, and will continue to use you as an example of how to live life. You are loved. My thoughts are with your family.</p>

	<p>A  freckled face little bruiser running one step behind a demanding and commanding butterfly.<br />
Wait for me ,he said. No, follow me said the butterfly continuing on her way. Oh no ,we will do it together !!!!!!!!! The butterfly paused in flight,gave one of her all knowing smiles and a lifelong friendship and kinship was born.<br />
30 plus years ago and the memory is as fresh as each sunrise. Corbett ,through out his life was strong ,resilient and indefatigable . Corbett climbing mountains that we mortals do not see and, his childhood butterfly, my niece Beth, flying to her next adventure that we can barely imagine will now never be but a step apart.</p>

	<p>Corbett took my brother, step daughter and I up Killimanjaro in September 1999.  He was the most wonderful company, funny, interesting, a man with a huge and generous heart.  Later, in 2006 I published a book called Loving Olivia, about brining up my autistic daughter and wrote about my first fundraising attempt, which was climbing Killi with Corbett.  We kept in touch via email, but I only managed to tie in with him once in the past 10 years.  I am deeply saddened by his death and my heart goes out to his wife and children, his parents and siblings.  I expect he is flying around with the angels now.</p>

	<p>The awesome stories shared from around the world truly highlight what a profound mark Corbett made on our lives since we all recognize his life is to be celebrated!</p>
<p>Chris Byrd reminded me when we spoke of his passing of how when we would be surfing Corbett was always ready to GO on any wave that came his way.</p>
<p>We would see a wave that he was out of position for&#8230; one that would certainly clean his clock and send him diving for the shallowest sand bar&#8230; but, every time we would yell, &#8220;GO CORBETT!&#8221;, he would without hesitation paddle hard and steadfast into that rogue wave we cheered him into.</p>
<p>He would do so smiling&#8230;</p>
<p>And he would eat shit&#8230;.</p>
<p>and roll around under water for far longer than we expected so that we became a bit worried.</p>
<p>Then, he would surface, with that unforgettable smile still plastered on his face&#8230; ready to do it all over again.</p>
<p>In remembrance I would love to hear the music Bebe and Hill performed recorded.</p>
<p>What a wonderful tribute!<br />
Bronson</p>

	<p>To all who knew and enjoyed Corbett&#8217;s company, and especially to his family in the USA and in East Africa&#8230;</p>
<p>The news of Corbett&#8217;s death brought me back to the reality of how unpredictable and ephemeral our lives seem. My thoughts and condolences go to all his family and friends.</p>
<p>Corbett and I apprenticed on Kilimanjaro together. He was definitely a character and was lots of fun to be around. </p>
<p>We had discussions way into the night a couple of times, and these had a tendency to degrade into shouting matches and calls for another shot of whisky. We would then end up sitting on the porch looking at the stars and philosophising or listening to some blues or country &amp; western music full blast.</p>
<p>He was extremely talented, knowledgeable about all kinds of things, and this he liked to blend with raw Texan&#8230;. whiskey, croc skin boots, American pride, chillies and guns. </p>
<p>We measure time with our clocks, diaries, photo albums and calendars, but in our minds it is elastic, and changeable:  long and ancient when our memories are clear, and random, fuzzy and confused at other times. </p>
<p>Anyone who has been on a great adventure wonders at how in so few days so much has happened. How time seems to behave differently to when we are in our 9-5 schedules. We have to think hard to remember what we did yesterday, never mind last week!  But only a week has passed in our measuring system.</p>
<p>Corbett had a full life, filled it to the brim, had fun, adventures, brought lovely kids into the world, played great music, laughed, partyed, and lots more.</p>

	<p>Corbett, You were and will always be an inspiration. I can&#8217;t believe this! I&#8217;ve uploaded a photo from beautiful Ol Tukai and thank you so much for keeping the door open for me after so many years. You have fired up so many people and you will never be forgotten. I always wanted to repay your hospitality and now that I can&#8217;t I will promise to instead carry a little of your energy with me forever. Much love and endless respect to you!<br />

	<p>I am filled with great sadness over this news. It has been over ten years since I saw Corbett but I thought of him often. </p>
<p>Corbett was an intense firery soul, who made everyday a true adventure. I am at a loss of words, so many stories are flashing through my head.<br />
Corbett driving me to the hospital to get checked for malaria.<br />
Riding around in his old land rover with no top and pink shag carpet on the dash.<br />
Corbett watching me get treed by a cape buffalo.<br />
Arguing over who is a better bush mechanic and why the car keeps turning off.<br />
Testing the culinary limits at road side eateries. </p>
<p>The list goes on but no thing is for certain he lived life with passion and fullness.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to his children and family. Much love and Blessings to you.</p>
<p>Corbett I wish we could have talked one last time. I love you.<br />
Jamii</p>

	<p>I did not know Corbett, but feel connected to the Colby family through my daughter Kaeley (&#8217;10) who is going into her senior year there.  I summitted Kilimanjaro in 2001, and grieve for the rapid disappearance of the summit glacier since then and the changes it will cause to the Arusha area around the base of this huge mountain.  I admire people who live their dreams, and don&#8217;t just dream- clearly Corbett was one of these people.  He built his life around conservation and this was a place where one person could make a difference.  I respect his committment, and grieve along with all of you for his premature death.</p>

	<p>I was saddened to go to my mailbox today, pull out my copy of the Colby magazine and read of Corbett&#8217;s untimely passing. Though we weren&#8217;t close friends, I feel like I got to know Corbett well enough to realize, almost immediately, what an original he was. They truly broke the mold with this guy&#8211;cracked it right through To the core and tossed it in the scrap heap. The Corbett I remember was a brilliant, witty conversationalist, who pushed friends and even casual acquaintencs to step out of convention and limitation, and live freely and blissfully in the moment.   God bless you Corbett and may your family draw on you spirit of wonder and possibility to sustain them, as they go forward.</p>

	<p>I was only a casual friend of Corbett&#8217;s in college and had not seen him since we graduated from Colby in &#8217;93. Yet, I had always looked forward to hearing of him from friends and in the pages of our alumni magazine. I admired his spirit of independence. Though I am saddened by his passing, I am also buoyed by the fact that his was a well-lived and well-loved life. At the risk of sounding trite, he is an inspiration.</p>

	<p>Thinking about what to write has taken me back in time through lots of memories.  Because I worked with Cindy for several years, I had some contact with Corbett.  I remember him as a wide eyed, barefoot and loveable kid. He could be both devious and innocent at the same time. Though our encounters were brief and infrequent, he had a talent for putting a smile on my face.<br />
  Corbett was priveledged to have Cindy as his mom.  Cindy was priveledged to have Corbett as her son.<br />
  Although I&#8217;m very sad for Cindy, Corbetts family and friends, I couldn&#8217;t help but smile when I saw pictures of Ella and Luca. They both have the same face, that same look that Corbett had when he was five and six years old and always managed to put a smile on my face.<br />
  Greive, mourn and cry. But, cherish the gifts Corbett left behind. Remeber the things that made us smile. What wonderful memories we all have</p>

	<p>As with others, I just learned of Corbett&#8217;s passing through our Colby alumni magazine.  I am deeply saddened.  As Jay noted above, Corbett made an immediate and favorable impression on everyone.  He was truly an amazing person and always full of fun, passion and life and I feel fortunate to have known him even a little (I will never forget watching him spontaneously scale the administration building one night). </p>
<p>My deepest sympathies go out to Corbett&#8217;s family.</p>

	<p>I am devastated to hear about Corbett. I didn&#8217;t know him very well&#8230;I did a brochure for him several years ago&#8230;but he seemed so young to have chosen such a big life. I had great admiration for him and his exotic world. </p>
<p>I just found out about his passing a day ago, and after looking at pictures of his beautiful children I cannot imagine what sense it makes for the world to lose one of the good guys. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>I am so sorry for your family&#8217;s loss.</p>

	<p>I only met Corbett twice so mainly postings at Cindy&#8217;s about his adventures as a safari guide.<br />
We&#8217;ve been to Arush twice but not when he was there.<br />
Cindy has been through more than any human ought to have to bear.<br />
We saw her in June and she is holding up amazingly.<br />
To lose one&#8217;s only child is unbearable.<br />
I&#8217;ve lost one and that is bad enough.</p>

	<p>Well, like many here, Corbett left such an impression&#8230;my experince wtih him was limited, but true, and awesome.  He was crazy fun, and truly so kind.  A rare and beautiful combination.  </p>
<p>His presence&#8230;an incredible, animated, honest smile and a heart to match&#8230;I dare anyone to say differently. </p>
<p>A gravitational spell of a person.  </p>
<p>I could tell you about a crazy hike (I think we were off trail, shocking), but what I rememer more was his listening one night, when I was feeling, as I do from time to time, the sadness of my mum&#8217;s departure from life.  I cannot describe, but he was so kind, so caring and so understanding.  And his hug, well&#8230;a Corbett hug is a hug indeed.</p>
<p>I feel lucky to have known him, and believe he will be inspirational in whatever path he travels upon, for I expect&#8230;.and truly hope, that for him, the journey will not ever end.  </p>
<p>To his family, my kindest and deepest sympathy.  </p>
<p>Kara</p>

Reading his freinds stories helps me envision what a wonderful soul he must have been and how I am sure he will live on in all those hearts he touched!!</p>

	<p>When Hunter told me the news of Corbett&#8217;s passing, I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  Among my first words were &#8220;what, wasn&#8217;t he our age???&#8221;.  I only met Corbett once in the early 1990&#8217;s (either over Thanksgiving or Christmas) but know the family well and know how highly respected he was by all who knew him.  Cindy (&amp; David), I am terribly sorry for your loss, but I know you take comfort and pride in knowing how great of a person Corbett was and how much of life he really lived.  Those who live much longer often do not take advantage of opportunities given to them.  One can not say the same for Corbett and is a lesson many of us should learn from!  Take care of your business now as you never know how much more time we have!</p>
<p>Billy, Hunter, and Whit &#8211; my thoughts and prayers have and will be with you.  I just found out about this website at the wedding or would have written sooner!</p>
<p>God bless.</p>

	<p>Cindy, I have just heard about Corbett&#8217;s death. He was certainly one of a kind and he was an inspiration to a lot of us. He never cared about what he was supposed to do, but just followed his heart and went straight for what he wanted.<br />
All my sympathy for you and his family.<br />
Juan Garcia</p>

	<p>We knew Corbett from Ol Tukai Lodge. He was a friend of ours and we will dearly miss him. We had great moments with him, he knows us so well, we are great friends and we offer our heartfelt condolences to his family. Ol Tukai Lodge is Amboseli&#8217;s haven for watching elephants and Corbertt knew is all too well.</p>

	<p>I knew Corbett from Tanzania when we were both involved in efforts to conserve the Tarangire Ecosystem that he loved so much.  I had wonderful times with him at Ol Donyo Orok, in Arusha and around the Maasai Steppe.  His hospitality was legend, as was his passion and temper.  The thing that I admired most about Corbett was his sense of honor.  He was one of the most honorable men I&#8217;ve ever met.  I&#8217;ve decided to dedicate a bicycle ride I&#8217;m doing across the country in his honor.    The ride is to raise funds for African rhino conservation and the link is at rhinoride.blogspot.com.</p>

	<p>I am pretty out of place with most of the people that have left comments on this guest page in that i had only spoken to Corbett on the phone twice, and met him only once- and that too- over business. </p>
<p>however i think that makes the point that has driven so many to post on this site, you could have known him for his entire life or for five minutes, but he left an everlasting impression. I shall never forget his kindness and manner, and whilst saddened by his passing, i thank god that i got to meet him.</p>
<p>My prayers go out to his family.</p>

	<p>Condolences to Corbett&#8217;s family.   I guess it isn&#8217;t just a cliche that the good die young.</p>
<p>I knew Corbett from my time at Colby before taking a year as a ski bum and transferring back home to Colorado in 1990.  He was the sort of character that stood out like a lighthouse in the sea of stodgy young preppies that populates a school like Colby, calling to fellow unconventional souls to come join him in his adventures.  </p>
<p>Despite the fact that I only overlapped time at Colby with Corbett for one year of the two I was there, he features prominently in many of the most vivid memories from that time.</p>
<p>One time he tried to talk me into joining him in a plan to board the freight trains that passed nearby to school and go on a spring break trip Boxcar Willie style.</p>
<p>Another time we drank too much Jim Beam and in a late night moment of angst we tussled over the opened blade of a Swiss Army knife and I was cut nearly to the bone on a finger, needing numerous stitches.</p>
<p>Of course there were the endless hours of hackysack and mountain biking on the endless muddy, muddy Maine trails.</p>
<p>Last time I saw him was when I came back to visit at the infamous sophomore off campus house and to collect my transcript and some recommendations from professors.  Hard to believe that it was about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I had looked Corbett up online a couple years ago and had thought that I&#8217;d take my family to Tanzania one of these years and visit, but alas the opportunity is missed.</p>
<p>Goodbye Corbett.</p>

	<p>What an amazing life! I did not know Corbett, but after reading all about his life and family, I have learned that this was a unique young man who lived his life to the fullest and with much love.  To his family, I am deeply sorry for your loss.<br />

I have had any communication with you.  Please know that you and your family will be in my prayers.  Judy told me of your son&#8217;s death.<br />
I have just gone through this pain with a dear friend of mine who lost her son this past Nov.from natural causes as well and left behind 2 beautiful daughters and a wife.  He too was 38.  I have a 38 yr. old daughter and cannot imagine the pain.<br />
My deepest sympathy,<br />
Sue</p>

	<p>Corbett,</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, my brother.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I tried to get your e-mail address off your website so I could wish you well for your birthday that I learned you had moved on, not long after our last exchange.  I&#8217;m sorry that my communications with you had become so infrequent.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sad to know I won&#8217;t see you again &#8211; the last time was years ago in Houston just after Luca was born &#8211; but rather than mourn, I celebrate our friendship.</p>
<p>Remember all the good times?  (Well, some are hazy and others are blurry.)  From the Texas heat to the Dominican beach to the bat cave in Ecuador, we had a few laughs together, didn&#8217;t we?  Remember the lunar eclipse?</p>
<p>Admittedly, some of the things we did were ill-inspired, ill-conceived, or just plain stupid, but we had fun.  I&#8217;m still undecided as to whether All-You-Can-Eat Sushi was a good idea or a bad one, but we certainly got our money&#8217;s worth&#8230;</p>
<p>A while back when you had been living in a teepee, you told me you were talking about me with your tentmates.  I still stand by what I said to you then, that it is a unique honor to have been a topic of Teepee Talk with Corbett Bishop.  I will always be proud of this fact.</p>
<p>You kept telling not to &#8220;dally&#8221; and to &#8220;come this side&#8221; because it was a &#8220;life like no other&#8221;.  Indeed, you lived a life like no other, and those of us who had the good fortune to know you are keeping you alive and well in our memories and our hearts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I dallied, Corbett; I really would have liked to see you in your true element.  If and when I finally take my family to visit Africa, it won&#8217;t be the same without Uncle Scorb.  Wherever you&#8217;ve gone though, when I get there you can be my guide.</p>
<p>Always your friend,</p>
<p>Yuji</p>

	<p>Hi Yuji,<br />
My name is Caroline &#8211; I was a friend of Corbett&#8217;s and I&#8217;m very close to his mom, Cindy.  She has been wanting to get in touch with you.  Her email is <a href="mailto:BISHDONN@aol.com">BISHDONN@aol.com</a>.  She was so excited to see your post and I know it would make her so happy to talk to you.  Thanks so much.<br />

	<p>I just found out today that my DEAR FRIEND Corbett is no longer with us. Corbett was a lifelong and at one time BEST FRIEND of mine. We would play war at his house or my grandparents house down the street on Charlotte St.  He and loved to do the same things and a many of times spent the night over his house. I am very sorry for his families loss. His Mom and Dad I remember so well. I E-Mailed an OLD FRIEND yesterday and just got news of his untimely death this morning , a year after his passing. If anyone in his family is reading this please contact me at (210) 782-5351. His Mother and I knew each other very well, so I would love to talk to her if I can. I am gonna miss my friend and was trying just this week to get a hold of him and then this BOMBSHELL was dropped on me. I am so very blessed to have known him the way I did and will forever miss him. Love you Corbett and will always remember you in my heart as my best friend. You left this world knowing that you had a very loving family and two beautiful children so I am at least at ease knowing this.Good Bye my Friend, Shannon Muckelroy.</p>

	<p>As I finish up the final details for the party announcing the Corbett Bishop Humanitarian Scholarship at Amigos de las Americas, I visited this website again and am awed all over again at what a remarkable life Corbett lived&#8230;.One can&#8217;t help but wish &#8230;.if you didn&#8217;t know him&#8211;that you had, if you did&#8211;that he was still with us, and that we all would live life to the fullest as Corbett did.    I will think of this man I never met for years to come with bittersweet admiration.</p>

	<p>Today marks 3 years since Corbett&#8217;s death&#8230; every year since, I try to make this a &#8220;Day Of Corbett&#8221; with my kids. We get crazy and wildly imaginative with them.  We make tree forts and battle bunkers and talk about world issues and how we might fix them&#8230; We grill something over fire and listen to music&#8230; Today will be fun and good to us again I&#8217;m sure.<br />
Still miss you my friend.</p>

	<p>I have never met nor spoken with Mr. Corbett Bishop in my life but I know that he was a highly respected and empowering person who constantly seeked adventures and helped others. I received the Corbett Bishop Humanitarian Scholarship from the Houston Chapter of Amigos de las Americas today, with many thanks to him. Because of him, students like me are given a chance to chase after their dreams. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.</p>
