<h1> Some Uniform and Normal Random Number Generators</h1>

<h2><em>xorgens</em></h2>

<em>xorgens</em> is a collection of uniform random number generators
written in C and returning 32 or 64-bit integer or real values.
The generators use a generalisation of Marsaglia's "xorshift"
random number generators 
[<a href="pub/pub218.html">218</a>, <a href="pub/pub224.html">224</a>]. 
They are fast, appear to be good,
and have periods greater than 10<sup>1200</sup>.
<p>

The source code of <em>version 3.06</em> is available
<a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/random/xorgens306.tar.gz">
here</a> (xorgens306.tar.gz) and 
<a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/random/xorgens306.zip">
here</a> (xorgens306.zip).
The theory is described in my paper [<a href="pub/pub224.html">224</a>].

The only difference between versions 3.04, 3.05 and 3.06 are a small
correction to the comments regarding the constant <em>weyl</em> (thanks to
G. Weijers for this) and a change in some declarations from <em>int</em>
to <em>unsigned int</em> to avoid a compiler warning about comparison
of signed and unsigned integers.
<p>

<em>xorgens</em> has been tested using various statistical tests and appears
to be satisfactory. However, we recommend that you do your own tests. 
<p>

If you want to experiment with different sets of parameters, a short
table of possibilities is available
<a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/random/xortable.txt">
here</a> (xortable.txt, 2K). Note that the code assumes that <em>r</em> is 
a power of two, so some small changes are required if this is not the case.
We do not recommend the generators with <em>n</em> < 256 because their 
state space is too small.
<p>

<em>xorgens</em> is available 
(free, but with absolutely no warranty) 
as open-source software under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
GNU General Public License</a>.
<p>

<h2><em>ranut</em></h2>

<em>ranut</em> is a uniform pseudo-random number generator which uses
recurrences based on 
<a href="trinom.html">
primitive trinomials</a>, or in some cases trinomials which have
large primitive factors (over the field GF(2)).
It is written in Fortran 77 and is optimised to run efficiently
on vector processors, but also works well on other machines with IEEE
Standard 64-bit floating-point arithmetic. The recurrences are implemented
directly in floating-point to generate real numbers in [0,1], rather than
integers.
<p>

<em>ranut</em> has been tested using George Marsaglia's 
<a href="http://stat.fsu.edu/~geo/"> <em>Diehard</em></a> package
and appears to be satisfactory. However, we recommend that you do your own
tests and, if necessary, combine the output of ranut with that of an
independent random number generator.
<p>

<em>ranut</em> is based on an earlier generator RANU4 (1991) which is 
described in [<a href="pub/pub132.html">132</a>].
<p>

Note that <em>ranut</em> and RANU4 implemented the "fast jump ahead" idea 
(using arithmetic modulo the generating polynomial) which
was recently 
rediscovered by Haramoto, Matsumoto, Nishimura, Panneton and L'Ecuyer
[INFORMS Journal on Computing 20, 3, Summer 2008, 385-390,
DOI: 10.1287/ijoc.1070.0251].
The implementation in RANU4 was described in
[Sec. 8, <a href="pub/pub132.html">132</a>].
<p>

Nowadays I prefer <em>xorgens</em> to <em>ranut</em> since generators based
on primitive trinomials have some theoretical weaknesses. However, the 
trinomials used in <em>ranut</em> have such high degree that these 
weaknesses are probably insignificant in practice.     


<h2><em>rannw</em></h2>
   
<em>rannw</em> is a Fortran 77 pseudo-random number generator which uses
a variant of Chris Wallace's method to generate normally distributed
(i.e.&nbsp;Gaussian) numbers. 
<p>

Most algorithms for generating normally
distributed random numbers are slow
because they first generate uniformly distributed numbers and
then transform them to normally distributed numbers.
<em>rannw</em> is potentially faster because it generates normally distributed
numbers directly, without using uniformly distributed numbers
(except occasionally, for initialisation etc).
<p>

<em>rannw</em> has been tested using Marsaglia's <em>Diehard</em> package
and appears to be satisfactory. (Because Diehard is designed to test
uniformly distributed numbers, the output of rannw was transformed 
appropriately before input to Diehard.)
<p>

<em>rannw</em> is based on an earlier generator RANN4 which is 
described in
[<a href="pub/pub170.html">170</a>,
 <a href="pub/pub185.html">185</a>].
<p>

Wallace's own implementation of his method (written in C) used to be available
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/research/mdmc/software/random/index.shtml">
here</a> (but the last time that I looked this link was broken).

<h2>Availability - the <em>random</em> package</h2>

<em>ranut</em> and <em>rannw</em> are available 
in the <em>random</em> package
(free, but with absolutely no warranty) 
as open-source software under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
GNU General Public License</a>.
<p>

A gzipped tar file of <em>random version 1.03</em> is available
<a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/random/rand103.tar.gz">
here</a> (48 KB).
There is also a
<a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/random/rand103.zip">
zip file</a> (55 KB).
The distribution contains the Fortran source code, test programs,
output obtained from testing with Diehard, etc.
