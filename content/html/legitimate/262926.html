<b><font size="5">Abstract</font></b></p>
<p align="left">Open source is software developed by uncoordinated but loosely 
collaborating programmers, using freely distributed source code and the 
communications infrastructure of the Internet. Open source has a long history 
rooted in the Hacker Ethic. The term open source was adopted in large part 
because of the ambiguous nature of free software. Various categories of free and 
non-free software are commonly referenced, some with interchangeable meanings. 
Several licensing agreements have therefore been developed to formalize 
distribution terms. The Cathedral and the Bazaar is the most frequently cited 
description of the open-source development methodology , however although the 
paper identifies many mechanisms of successful open-source development, it does 
not expose the dynamics. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of 
open-source projects currently in existence.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Open source has generated a considerable amount of interest over the 
past year. The concept itself is based on the philosophy of free software, which 
advocates freely available source code as a fundamental right. However, open 
source extends this ideology slightly to present a more commercial approach that 
includes both a business model and development methodology.</p>
<p>Open Source Software, or OSS, refers to software for which the source code is 
distributed without charge or limitations on modifications. Open source sells 
this approach as a business model, emphasizing faster development and lower 
overhead, as well as a closer customer relationship and exposure to a broader 
market.</p>
<p>Open source also encompasses a software development methodology. Open source 
development is described as a rapid evolutionary process, which leverages 
large-scale peer review. The basic premise is that allowing source code to be 
freely modified and redistributed encourages collaborative development. The 
software can be incrementally improved and more easily tested, resulting in a 
highly reliable product.</p>
<h3>1.1 Background</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Much of the Internet infrastructure is open-source software. For 
example, Sendmail is the dominant mail transfer system on the Internet. BIND is 
the most widely used implementation of the Internet Domain Name System, and 
InterNetNews is the most popular Usenet news server. (OReilly, 1998a) It is 
therefore no surprise that the momentum associated with open source has 
coincided with the rapid growth of the Internet. The Web has made collaboration 
between programmers easier and possible on a larger scale than before, and 
projects such as Linux and Apache have become immensely successful. The 
projected size of various open-source communities is shown in Table 1 (O'Reilly, 
1998b).</p>

<p>The response from the software industry has been varied, but open source has 
made some notable inroads in a relatively short time. IBM has adopted the Apache 
Web server as the cornerstone of its WebSphere Internet-commerce application 
server (IBM, 1998). IBM has also released the source code for an XML parser and 
Jikes, a Java byte code interpreter (Gonsalves, 1998). Netscape has released the 
source code for the next generation of its popular Communicator product, 
restructuring ongoing development as an open-source project (Charles, 1998). 
Apple has taken a similar approach, releasing portions of its next generation 
operating system, MacOS X, as open source (Apple, 1999a). Microsoft acknowledged 
open source as a potential business threat in an internal memo that was 
subsequently leaked to the press (Valloppillil, 1998), and has recently 
indicated that it may consider releasing some code.</p>
<p>These developments demonstrate a sustained interest in open source, and it is 
quickly becoming a viable alternative to conventional methods of software 
development, as companies attempt to leverage the Internet in reducing time to 
market.</p>
<h2>2. History</h2>
<h3>2.1 The Hacker Ethic</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Open source is firmly rooted in the Hacker Ethic. In the late 1950s, 
MITs computer culture originated the term hacker, defined today as &quot;a person 
who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems &quot; (Raymond, 1996). 
Various members of the Tech Model Railroad Club, or TMRC, formed the nucleus of 
MITs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. These individuals were obsessed with 
the way systems worked. The word hack had long been used to describe elaborate 
college pranks devised by MIT students, however TMRC members used the word to 
describe a task imbued with innovation, style, and technical virtuosity&quot; (Levy, 
1984). A project undertaken not solely to fulfill some constructive goal, but 
with some intense creative interest was called a hack.</p>
<p>Projects encompassed everything electronic, including constant improvements 
to the elaborate switching system controlling the TMRCs model railroad. 
Increasingly though, attentions were directed toward writing computer programs, 
initially for an IBM 704 and later on the TX-0, one of the first transistor-run 
computers in the world. Early hackers would spend days working on programs 
intended to explore the limits of these machines.</p>
<p>In 1961, MIT acquired a PDP-1, the first minicomputer, designed not for huge 
number-crunching tasks but for scientific inquiry, mathematical formulations, 
and of course hacking. Manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation, the PDP 
series of computers pioneered commercial interactive computing and time-sharing 
operating systems. MIT hackers developed software that was freely distributed by 
DEC to other PDP owners. Programming at MIT became a rigorous application of the 
Hacker Ethic, a belief that &quot;access to computers  and anything which might 
teach you something about the way the world works  should be unlimited and 
total&quot; (Levy, 1984).</p>
<h3>2.2 ARPAnet</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>MIT was soon joined by Stanford Universitys Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory and later Carnegie-Mellon University. All were thriving centres of 
software development able to communicate with each other through the ARPAnet, 
the first transcontinental, high-speed data network. Built by the Defense 
Department in the late 1960s, it was originally designed as an experiment in 
digital communication. However, the ARPAnet quickly grew to link hundreds of 
universities, defense contractors, and research laboratories. This allowed for 
the free exchange of information with unprecedented speed and flexibility, 
particularly software.</p>
<p>Programmers began to actively contribute to various shared projects. These 
early collaborative efforts led to informal principles and guidelines for 
distributed software development stemming from the Hacker Ethic. The most widely 
known of these projects was UNIX, which contributed to the ongoing growth of 
what would eventually become the Internet.</p>
<h3>2.3 Unix and BSD</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Unix was originally developed at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, and was not strictly 
speaking a freely available product. However, it was licensed to universities 
for a nominal sum, which resulted in an explosion of creativity as programmers 
built on each others work. </p>
<p>Traditionally, operating systems had been written in assembler to maximize 
hardware efficiency, but by the early 1970s hardware and compiler technology 
had become good enough that an entire operating system could be written in a 
higher level language. UNIX was written in C, and this provided unheard of 
portability between hardware platforms, allowing programmers to write software 
that could be more easily shared and dispersed.</p>
<p>The most significant source of Unix development outside of Bell Labs was the 
University of California at Berkeley. UC Berkeleys Computer Science Research 
Group folded their own changes and other contributions into a succession of 
releases. Berkley Unix came to be known as BSD, or Berkley Standard 
Distribution, and included a rewritten file system, networking capabilities, 
virtual memory support, and a variety of utilities (Ritchie, 1979).</p>
<p>A few of the BSD contributors founded Sun Microsystems, marketing Unix on 
68000-based hardware. Rivalry ensued between supporters of Berkley Unix and AT&amp;T 
versions. This intensified in 1984, when AT&amp;T divested and Unix was sold as a 
commercial product for the first time through Unix System Laboratories.</p>
<h3>2.4 The GNU Project</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The commercialization of Unix not only fractured the developer 
community, but it resulted in a confusing mass of competing standards that made 
it increasingly difficult to develop portable software. Other companies had 
entered the marketplace, selling various proprietary versions of Unix. 
Development largely stagnated, and Unix System Laboratories was sold to Novell 
after efforts to create a canonical commercial version failed. The GNU project 
was conceived in 1983 to rekindle the cooperative spirit that had previously 
dominated software development.</p>
<p>GNU, which stands for GNUs Not Unix, was initiated under the direction of 
Richard S. Stallman, who had been a later participant in MITs Artificial 
Intelligence Lab and believed strongly in the Hacker Ethic. The GNU project had 
the ambitious goal of developing a freely available Unix-like operating system 
that would include command processors, assemblers, compilers, interpreters, 
debuggers, text editors, mailers, and much more. (FSF, 1998a)</p>
<p>Stallman created the Free Software Foundation, an organization that promotes 
the development and use of free software, particularly the GNU operating system 
(FSF, 1998c). Hundreds of programmers created new, freely available versions of 
all major Unix utility programs. Many of these utilities were so powerful that 
they became the de facto standard on all Unix systems. However, a project to 
create a replacement for the Unix kernel faltered.</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, the proliferation of low-cost, high-performance personal 
computers along with the rapid growth of the World Wide Web had reduced entry 
barriers to participation in collaborative projects. Free software development 
extended to reach a much larger community of potential contributors, and 
projects such as Linux and Apache became immensely successful, prompting a 
further formalism of hacker best practices. </p>
<h3>2.5 The Cathedral and the Bazaar</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond, 1998a), a position paper 
advocating the Linux development model, was first presented at Linux Kongress 97 
and made widely available on the Web shortly thereafter. The paper presents two 
singular approaches to software development. The Cathedral represents 
conventional commercial practices, where developers work using a relatively 
closed, centralized methodology. In contrast, the Bazaar embodies the Hacker 
Ethic, in which software development is an openly cooperative effort.</p>
<p>The paper essentially ignored contemporary techniques in software 
engineering, using the Cathedral as a pseudonym for the waterfall lifecycle of 
the 1970s (Royce, 1970), however it served to attract widespread attention. A 
grassroots movement quickly developed, culminating in a January 1998 
announcement that Netscape Communications would release the source code for its 
Web browser. This was the first time that a Fortune 500 company had transformed 
an enormously popular commercial product into free software.</p>
<p>The term Open Source was coined shortly afterward out of a growing 
realization that free software development could be marketed as a viable 
alternative to commercial companies.</p>
<h2>3. Definition</h2>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The term open source was adopted in large part because of the 
ambiguous nature of the expression <em>free software</em>. The notion of free 
software does not mean free in the financial sense, but instead refers to the 
users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software. 
Confusion over the meaning can be traced to the problem that, in English, free 
can mean <em>no cost</em> as well as <em>freedom</em>. In most other languages, 
free and freedom do not share the same root; <em>gratuit</em> and <em>libre</em>, 
for instance. &quot;To understand the concept, you should think of free speech, not 
free beer,&quot; writes Richard Stallman (FSF, 1999a).</p>
<h3>3.1 Categories of Free and Non-Free Software</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Due to the inherent ambiguity of the terminology, various wordings are 
used interchangeably. This is misleading, as software may be interpreted as 
something it is not. Even closely related terms such as free software and open 
source have developed subtle distinctions. (FSF, 1998b)</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Public Domain</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Free software is often confused with public domain software. If 
software is in the public domain, then it is not subject to ownership and there 
are no restrictions on its use or distribution. More specifically, public domain 
software is not copyrighted. If a developer places software in the public 
domain, then he or she has relinquished control over it. Someone else can take 
the software, modify it, and restrict the source code. </p>
<h4>3.1.2 Freeware</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Freeware is commonly used to describe software that can be 
redistributed but not modified. The source code is not available, and 
consequently freeware should not be used to refer to free software.</p>
<h4>3.1.3 Shareware</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Shareware is distributed freely, like freeware. Users can redistribute 
shareware, however anyone who continues to use a copy is required to pay a 
modest license fee. Shareware is seldom accompanied by the source code, and is 
not free software.</p>
<h4>3.1.4 Open Source</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Open source is used to mean more or less the same thing as free 
software. Free software is &quot;software that comes with permission for anyone to 
use, copy, and distribute, either verbatim or with modifications, either gratis 
or for a fee.&quot; (FSF, 1999a) In particular, this means that source code must be 
available. </p>
<p>Free software is often used in a political context, whereas open source is a 
more commercially oriented term. The Free Software Foundation advocates free 
software as a right, emphasizing the ethical obligations associated with 
software distribution (Stallman, 1999). Open source is commonly used to describe 
the business case for free software, focusing more on the development process 
rather than any underlying moral requirements.</p>
<h3>3.2 Licensing</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Various free software licenses have been developed. The licenses each 
disclaim all warranties. The intent is to protect the author from any liability 
associated with the software. Since the software is provided free of charge, 
this would seem to be a reasonable request.</p>
<p>Table 2 provides a comparison of several common licensing practices (Perens, 
1999).</p>

</table>
<h4>3.2.1 Copyleft and the GNU Public License</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Copyleft is a concept originated by Richard Stallman to address 
problems associated with placing software in the public domain. As mentioned 
previously, public domain software is not copyrighted. Someone can make changes 
to the software, many or few, and distribute the result as a proprietary 
product. People who receive the modified product may not have the same freedoms 
that the original author provided. Copyleft says that &quot;anyone who redistributes 
the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further 
copy and change it.&quot; (FSF, 1999b)</p>
<p>To copyleft a program, first it is copyrighted and then specific distribution 
terms are added. These terms are a legal instrument that provide rights to &quot;use, 
modify, and redistribute the program's code or any program derived from it but 
only if the distribution terms are unchanged.&quot; (FSF, 1999b)</p>
<p>In the GNU project, copyleft distribution terms are contained in the GNU 
General Public License, or GPL. The GPL does not allow private modifications. 
Any changes must also be distributed under the GPL. This not only protects the 
original author, but it also encourages collaboration, as any improvements are 
made freely available</p>
<p>Additionally, the GPL does not allow the incorporation of licensed programs 
into proprietary software. Any software that does not grant as many rights as 
the GPL is defined as proprietary. However, the GPL contains certain loopholes 
that allow it to be used with software that is not entirely free. Software 
libraries that are normally distributed with the compiler or operating system 
may be linked with programs licensed under the GPL. The result is a 
partially-free program. The copyright holder has the right to violate the 
license, but this right does not extend to any third parties who redistribute 
the program. Subsequent distributions must follow all of the terms of the 
license, even those that the copyright holder violates.</p>
<p>An alternate form of the GPL, the GNU General Library Public License or LGPL, 
allows the linking of free software libraries into proprietary executables under 
certain conditions. In this way, commercial development can also benefit from 
free software. A program covered by the LGPL can be converted to the GPL at any 
time, but that program, or anything derived from it, cannot be converted back to 
the LGPL.</p>
<p>The GPL is a political manifesto as well as a software license, and much of 
the text is concerned with explaining the rationale behind the license. 
Unfortunately this political dialogue has alienated some developers. For 
example, Larry Wall, creator of Perl and the Artistic license, says &quot;the FSF 
[Free Software Foundation] has religious aspects that I dont care for&quot; (Lash, 
1998). As a result, some free software advocates have created more liberal 
licensing terms, avoiding the political rhetoric associated with the GPL.</p>
<h4>3.2.2 The X, BSD, and Apache Licenses</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The X license and the related BSD and Apache licenses are very 
different from the GPL and LGPL. The software originally covered by the X and 
BSD licenses was funded by monetary grants from the US government. In this 
sense, the public owned the software, and the X and BSD licenses therefore grant 
relatively broad permissions.</p>
<p>The most important difference is that X-licensed modifications can be made 
private. An X-licensed program can be modified and redistributed without 
including the source or applying the X license to the modifications. Other 
developers have adopted the X license and its variants, including the BSD and 
the Apache web server. </p>
<h4>3.2.3 The Artistic License</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The Artistic license was originally developed for Perl, however it has 
since been used for other software. The terms are more loosely defined in 
comparison with other licensing agreements, and the license is more commercially 
oriented. For instance, under certain conditions modifications can be made 
private. Furthermore, although sale of the software is prohibited, the software 
can be bundled with other programs, which may or may not be commercial, and 
sold. </p>
<h4>3.2.4 The Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The Netscape Public License, or NPL, was originally developed by 
Netscape. The NPL contains special privileges that apply only to Netscape. 
Specifically, it allows Netscape to re-license code covered by the NPL to third 
parties under different terms. This provision was necessary to satisfy 
proprietary contracts between Netscape and other companies. The NPL also allows 
Netscape to use code covered by the NPL in other Netscape products without those 
products falling under the NPL.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the free software community was somewhat critical of the 
NPL. Netscape subsequently released the MPL, or Mozilla Public License. The MPL 
is similar to the NPL, but it does not contain exemptions. Both the NPL and the 
MPL allow private modifications.</p>
<h4>3.2.5 The Open Source Definition</h4>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The Open Source Definition is not a software license. Instead it is a 
specification of what is permissible in a software license for that software to 
be considered open source. The Open Source Definition is based on the Debian 
free software guidelines or social contract, which provides a framework for 
evaluating other free software licenses.</p>
<p>The Open Source Definition includes several criteria, which can be 
paraphrased as follows (OSI, 1999):</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Free Redistribution</em>  Copies of the software can be made at no 
    cost. </li>
    <li><em>Source Code</em>  The source code must be distributed with the 
    original work, as well as all derived works. </li>
    <li><em>Derived Works </em> Modifications are allowed, however it is not 
    required that the derived work be subject to the same license terms as the 
    original work. </li>
    <li><em>Integrity of the Authors Source Code</em>  Modifications to the 
    original work may be restricted only if the distribution of patches is 
    allowed. Derived works may be required to carry a different name or version 
    number from the original software. </li>
    <li><em>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</em>  Discrimination 
    against any person or group of persons is not allowed. </li>
    <li><em>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</em>  Restrictions 
    preventing use of the software by a certain business or area of research are 
    not allowed. </li>
    <li><em>Distribution of License</em>  Any terms should apply automatically 
    without written authorization. </li>
    <li><em>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</em>  Rights attached to 
    a program must not depend on that program being part of a specific software 
    distribution. </li>
    <li><em>License Must Not Contaminate Other Software</em>  Restrictions on 
    other software distributed with the licensed software are not allowed. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The GNU GPL, BSD, X Consortium, MPL, and Artistic licenses are all examples 
of licenses that conform to the Open Source Definition. </p>
<p>The evaluation of a proposed license elicits considerable debate in the free 
software community. With the growing popularity of open source, many companies 
are developing licenses intended to capitalize on this interest. Some of these 
licenses conform to the Open Source Definition, however others do not. For 
example, the Sun Community Source License approximates some open source 
concepts, but it does not conform to the Open Source Definition. The Apple 
Public Source License, or APSL (Apple, 1999b), as been alternately endorsed and 
rejected by members of the open-source community.</p>
<h2>4. Methodology</h2>
<font size="2">
<p></font>The Cathedral and the Bazaar is the most frequently cited description 
of the open-source development methodology. Eric Raymonds discussion of the 
Linux development model as applied to a small project is a useful commentary. 
However, it should be noted that although the paper identifies many mechanisms 
of successful open-source development, it does not expose the dynamics. In this 
sense, the description is inherently weak.</p>
<h3>4.1 Plausible Promise</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Raymond remarks that it would be difficult to <em>originate</em> a 
project in bazaar mode. To build a community, a program must first demonstrate 
plausible promise. The implementation can be crude or incomplete, but it must 
convince others of its potential. This is given as a necessary precondition of 
the bazaar, or open-source, style.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many commercial software companies use this approach to ship 
software products. Microsoft, for example, consistently ships early versions of 
products that are notoriously bug ridden. However as long as a product can 
demonstrate plausible promise, either by setting a standard or uniquely 
satisfying a potential need, it is not necessary for early versions to be 
particularly strong.</p>
<p>Critics suggest that the effective utilization of bazaar principles by closed 
source developers implies ambiguity. Specifically, that the Cathedral and the 
Bazaar does not sufficiently describe certain aspects of the open-source 
development process (Eunice, 1998).</p>
<h3>4.2 Release Early, Release Often</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Early and frequent releases are critical to open-source development. 
Improvements in functionality are incremental, allowing for rapid evolution, and 
developers are &quot;rewarded by the sight of constant improvement in their work.&quot; 
(Raymond, 1998a)</p>
<p>Product evolution and incremental development are not new. Mills initially 
proposed that any software system should be <em>grown</em> by incremental 
development (Mills, 1971). Brooks would later elaborate on this concept, 
suggesting that developers should grow rather than build software, adding more 
functions to systems as they are run, used, and tested (Brooks, 1986). Basili 
suggested the concept of iterative enhancement in large-scale software 
development (Basili and Turner, 1975), and Boehm proposed the spiral model, a 
evolutionary prototyping approach incorporating risk management (Boehm, 1986).</p>
<p>Open source relies on the Internet to noticeably shorten the iterative cycle. 
Raymond notes that &quot;it wasnt unknown for [Linus] to release a new kernel more 
than once a day.&quot; (Raymond, 1998a) Mechanisms for efficient distribution and 
rapid feedback make this practice effective.</p>
<p>However, successful application of an evolutionary approach is highly 
dependent on a modular architecture. Weak modularity compromises change impact 
and minimizes the effectiveness of individual contributors. In this respect, 
projects that do not encourage a modular architecture may not be suitable for 
open-source development. This contradicts Raymonds underlying assertion, that 
open source is a universally better approach.</p>
<h3>4.3 Debugging is Parallelizable</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Raymond emphasizes large-scale peer review as the fundamental 
difference underlying the cathedral and bazaar styles. The bazaar style assumes 
that &quot;given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every 
problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&quot; Debugging 
requires less coordination relative to development, and thus is not subject &quot;to 
the same quadratic complexity and management costs that make adding developers 
problematic.&quot; (Raymond, 1998a)</p>
<p>The basic premise is that more debuggers will contribute to a shorter test 
cycle without significant additional cost. In other words, &quot;more users find more 
bugs because adding more users adds more ways of stressing the program.&quot; 
(Raymond, 1998a) However, open source is not a prerequisite for peer review. For 
instance, various forms of peer review are commonly employed in software 
engineering. The question might then become one of scale, but Microsoft 
practices beta-testing on a scale matched only by larger open-source projects.</p>
<p>Raymond continues, suggesting that debugging is even more efficient when 
users are co-developers, as is most often the case in open-source projects. This 
is also subject to debate. Raymond notes that each tester &quot;approaches the task 
of bug characterization with a slightly different perceptual set and analytical 
toolkit, a different angle on the problem.&quot; (Raymond, 1998a) This is 
characterized by the fact that developers and end-users evaluate products in 
very different ways. It therefore seems likely that peer review under the bazaar 
model would be constrained by a disproportionate number of co-developers.</p>
<h2>5. Project Profiles</h2>
<font size="2">
<p></font>There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of open-source 
projects currently in existence. These projects include operating systems, 
programming languages, utilities, Internet applications and many more. The 
following projects are notable for their influence, size, and success.</p>
<h3>5.1 Linux</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Linux is a Unix-like operating system that runs on several platforms, 
including Intel processors, Motorola MC68K, and DEC Alphas (SSC, 1998). It is a 
superset of the POSIX specification, with SYS V and BSD extensions. Linux began 
as a hobby project of Linus Torvalds, a graduate student at the University of 
Helsinki. The project was inspired by his interest in Minix, a small Unix system 
developed primarily as an educational tool by Andy Tannenbaum. Linus set out to 
create, in his own words, &quot;a better Minix than Minix.&quot; In October 1991, Linus 
announced the first official release of Linux, version 0.02. Since then, 
hundreds of programmers have contributed to the ongoing improvement of the 
system.</p>
<p>Linux kernel development is largely coordinated through the <em>linux-kernel</em> 
mailing list. The list is high volume, and currently includes over 200 active 
developers as well as many other debuggers and testers. With the growth of the 
project, Linus has relinquished control over certain areas of the kernel, such 
as file systems and networking, to other trusted lieutenants.&quot; However, Linus 
remains the final authority on decisions related to kernel development. The 
kernel is under the GPL, and official versions are made available via ftp.</p>
<p>Arguably the most well known open-source project, Linux has quietly gained 
popularity in academia as well as among scientific researchers and Internet 
service providers. Recently, it has made commercial advances, and is currently 
marketed as the only viable alternative to Microsoft Windows NT. A study by 
International Data Corporation reported that Linux accounted for 17.2 % of 
server operating system shipments in 1998, an increase of 212% over the previous 
year (Shankland, 1998). The Linux kernel is typically packaged with the various 
other programs that comprise a Unix operating system. Several commercial 
companies currently sell these packages as Linux distributions.</p>
<h3>5.2 Apache</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Apache originated in early 1995 as a series of enhancements to the 
then-popular public domain HTTP daemon developed by Rob McCool at the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications, or NCSA. Rob McCool had left NCSA in mid 
1994, and many Webmasters had become frustrated with a lack of further 
development. Some proceeded to develop their own fixes and improvements. A small 
group coordinated these changes in the form of patches and made the first 
official release of the Apache server in April 1995, hence the name A PAtCHy 
server. (Laurie, 1999)</p>
<p>The Apache Group is currently a core group of about 20 project contributors, 
who now focus more on business issues and security problems. The larger user 
community manages mainstream development. Apache operates as a meritocracy, in a 
format similar to most open-source projects. Responsibility is based on 
contribution, or &quot;the more work you have done, the more work you are allowed to 
do.&quot; (The Apache Group, 1999) Development is coordinated through the <em>new-httpd</em> 
mailing list, and a voting process exists for conflict resolution. </p>
<p>Apache has consistently ranked as the most popular Web server on the Internet 
(Netcraft, 1999). Currently, Apache dominates the market and is more widely used 
than all other Web servers combined. Industry leaders such as DEC, UUNet, and 
Yahoo use Apache. Several companies, including C2Net, distribute commercial 
versions of Apache, earning money for support services and added utilities.</p>
<h3>5.3 Mozilla</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Mozilla is an open-source deployment of Netscapes popular Web 
browsing suite, Netscape Communicator. Netscapes decision was strongly 
influenced by a whitepaper written by employee Frank Hecker (Hecker, 1998), 
which referenced the Cathedral and the Bazaar. In January 1998, Netscape 
announced that the source code for the next generation of Communicator would be 
made freely available. The first developer release of the source code was made 
in late March 1998.</p>
<p>Mozilla.org exists as a group within Netscape responsible for coordinating 
development. Mozilla has established an extensive web site, which includes 
problem reporting and version management tools. Discussion forums are available 
through various newsgroups and mailing lists. The project is highly modular and 
consists of about 60 groups, each responsible for a particular subsystem. All 
code issued in March was released under the NPL. New code can be released under 
the MPL or any compatible license. Changes to the original code are considered 
modifications and are covered by the NPL.</p>
<p>Although it has benefited from widespread media exposure, Mozilla has yet to 
result in a production release. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the 
commercial success of the project. The recent merger of AOL and Netscape has 
introduced additional uncertainty, but many continue to feel confident that the 
project will produce a next generation browser.</p>
<h3>5.4 Perl and Python</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Perl and Python are mature scripting languages that have achieved 
considerable market success. Originally developed in 1986 by Larry Wall, Perl 
has become the language of choice for system and network administration, as well 
as CGI programming. Large commercial Web sites such as Yahoo and Amazon make 
extensive use of Perl to provide interactive services.</p>
<p>Perl, which stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language, is 
maintained by a core group of programmers via the <em>perl5porters</em> mailing 
list. Larry Wall retains artistic control of the language, but a well-defined 
extension mechanism allows for the development of add-on modules by independent 
programmers. (Wall <em>et al</em>, 1996)</p>
<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum at Centrum voor Wiskunde en 
Informatica, or CWI, in Amsterdam. It is an interactive, object-oriented 
language and includes interfaces to various system calls and libraries, as well 
as to several popular windowing systems. The Python implementation is portable 
and runs on most common platforms. (Lutz, 1996)</p>
<h3>5.5 KDE and GNOME</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>KDE and GNOME are X11 based desktop environments. KDE also includes an 
application development framework and desktop office suite. The application 
framework is based on KOM/OpenParts technology, and leverages open industry 
standards such as the object request broker CORBA 2.0. The office suite, KOffice, 
consists of a spreadsheet, a presentation tool, an organizer, and an email and 
news client.</p>
<p>GNOME, or the GNU Network Object Model Environment, is similar in many ways 
to KDE. However GNOME uses the gtk+ toolkit, which is also open source, whereas 
KDE uses Qt, a foundation library from Troll Tech that was commercially licensed 
until recently.</p>
<p>KDE and GNOME are interesting because they represent the varying commitments 
in the open source community to commercial markets and the free software 
philosophy. The KDE group and Troll Tech initially tried to incorporate Qt, a 
proprietary product, into the Linux infrastructure. This was met with mixed 
reactions. The prospect of a graphical desktop for Linux was so attractive that 
some were willing to overlook the contradictory nature of the project. However, 
others rejected KDE and instead supported GNOME, which was initiated as a fully 
open source competitor. Eventually, Troll Tech realized Qt would not be 
successful in the Linux market without a change in license, and a new agreement 
was released, defusing the conflict. GNOME continues, aiming to best KDE in 
terms of functionality rather than philosophy (Perens, 1999).</p>
<h3>5.6 Other Projects</h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font>Other lesser known, but equally interesting, projects include GIMP, 
FreeBuilder, Samba, and Kaffe. Each of these projects follows the open source 
methodology, originating under the direction of an individual or small group and 
rapidly extending to a larger development community.</p>
<p>GIMP, or the GNU Image Manipulation Program, can be used for tasks such as 
photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. GIMP was written by 
Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball, and released under the GPL. FreeBuilder is a 
visual programming environment based on Java. It includes an integrated text 
editor, debugger, and compiler. Samba allows Unix systems to act as file and 
print servers on Microsoft Windows networks. Development is headed by Andrew 
Tridgell. Kaffe is a cleanroom implementation of the Java virtual machine and 
class libraries.</p>
<h2>6. Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Open source is software developed by uncoordinated but loosely collaborating 
programmers, using freely distributed source code and the communications 
infrastructure of the Internet.&nbsp; Open source is based on the philosophy of free 
software. &nbsp; However, open source extends this ideology slightly to present a 
more commercial approach that includes both a business model and development 
methodology. Various categories of free and non-free software are commonly, and 
incorrectly, referenced, including public domain, freeware, and shareware.&nbsp; 
Licensing agreements such as the GPL have been developed to formalize 
distribution terms.&nbsp; The Open Source Definition provides a framework for 
evaluating these licenses.</p>
<p>The Cathedral and the Bazaar is the most frequently cited description of the 
open-source development methodology, however although the paper identifies many 
mechanisms of successful open-source development, it does not expose the 
dynamics.&nbsp; Critics note that certain aspects remain ambiguous, which suggests 
that the paper does not sufficiently describe the open-source development 
process.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of open-source projects currently in 
existence. &nbsp; These projects face growing challenges in terms of scalability and 
inherently weak tool support.&nbsp; However open source is a pragmatic example of 
software development over the Internet.&nbsp; It provides interesting lessons with 
regard to large-scale collaboration and distributed coordination.&nbsp; If the 
open-source approach is adequately studied and evaluated, ideally the 
methodology might be applied in a broader context.</p>
