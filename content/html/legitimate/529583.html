CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
It is your human environment that makes climate.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
Sept. 15--Night.  Close to Australia now.  Sydney 50 miles distant.<br>
<br>
That note recalls an experience.  The passengers were sent for, to come<br>
up in the bow and see a fine sight.  It was very dark.  One could not<br>
follow with the eye the surface of the sea more than fifty yards in any<br>
direction it dimmed away and became lost to sight at about that distance<br>
from us.  But if you patiently gazed into the darkness a little while,<br>
there was a sure reward for you.  Presently, a quarter of a mile away you<br>
would see a blinding splash or explosion of light on the water--a flash<br>
so sudden and so astonishingly brilliant that it would make you catch<br>
your breath; then that blotch of light would instantly extend itself and<br>
take the corkscrew shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent,<br>
with every curve of its body and the "break" spreading away from its<br>
head, and the wake following behind its tail clothed in a fierce splendor<br>
of living fire.  And my, but it was coming at a lightning gait!  Almost<br>
before you could think, this monster of light, fifty feet long, would go<br>
flaming and storming by, and suddenly disappear.  And out in the distance<br>
whence he came you would see another flash; and another and another and<br>
another, and see them turn into sea-serpents on the instant; and once<br>
sixteen flashed up at the same time and came tearing towards us, a swarm<br>
of wiggling curves, a moving conflagration, a vision of bewildering<br>
beauty, a spectacle of fire and energy whose equal the most of those<br>
people will not see again until after they are dead.<br>
<br>
It was porpoises--porpoises aglow with phosphorescent light.  They<br>
presently collected in a wild and magnificent jumble under the bows, and<br>
there they played for an hour, leaping and frollicking and carrying on,<br>
turning summersaults in front of the stem or across it and never getting<br>
hit, never making a miscalculation, though the stem missed them only<br>
about an inch, as a rule.  They were porpoises of the ordinary length<br>
--eight or ten feet--but every twist of their bodies sent a long<br>
procession of united and glowing curves astern.  That fiery jumble was<br>
an enchanting thing to look at, and we stayed out the performance; one<br>
cannot have such a show as that twice in a lifetime.  The porpoise is the<br>
kitten of the sea; he never has a serious thought, he cares for nothing<br>
but fun and play.  But I think I never saw him at his winsomest until<br>
that night. It was near a center of civilization, and he could have been<br>
drinking.<br>
<br>
By and by, when we had approached to somewhere within thirty miles of<br>
Sydney Heads the great electric light that is posted on one of those<br>
lofty ramparts began to show, and in time the little spark grew to a<br>
great sun and pierced the firmament of darkness with a far-reaching sword<br>
of light.<br>
<br>
Sydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends some miles like<br>
a wall, and exhibits no break to the ignorant stranger.  It has a break<br>
in the middle, but it makes so little show that even Captain Cook sailed<br>
by it without seeing it.  Near by that break is a false break which<br>
resembles it, and which used to make trouble for the mariner at night, in<br>
the early days before the place was lighted.  It caused the memorable<br>
disaster to the Duncan Dunbar, one of the most pathetic tragedies in the<br>
history of that pitiless ruffian, the sea.  The ship was a sailing<br>
vessel; a fine and favorite passenger packet, commanded by a popular<br>
captain of high reputation.  She was due from England, and Sydney was<br>
waiting, and counting the hours; counting the hours, and making ready to<br>
give her a heart-stirring welcome; for she was bringing back a great<br>
company of mothers and daughters, the long-missed light and bloom of life<br>
of Sydney homes; daughters that had been years absent at school, and<br>
mothers that had been with them all that time watching over them.  Of all<br>
the world only India and Australasia have by custom freighted ships and<br>
fleets with their hearts, and know the tremendous meaning of that phrase;<br>
only they know what the waiting is like when this freightage is entrusted<br>
to the fickle winds, not steam, and what the joy is like when the ship<br>
that is returning this treasure comes safe to port and the long dread is<br>
over.<br>
<br>
On board the Duncan Dunbar, flying toward Sydney Heads in the waning<br>
afternoon, the happy home-comers made busy preparation, for it was not<br>
doubted that they would be in the arms of their friends before the day<br>
was done; they put away their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeter<br>
for the meeting, their richest and their loveliest, these poor brides of<br>
the grave.  But the wind lost force, or there was a miscalculation, and<br>
before the Heads were sighted the darkness came on.  It was said that<br>
ordinarily the captain would have made a safe offing and waited for the<br>
morning; but this was no ordinary occasion; all about him were appealing<br>
faces, faces pathetic with disappointment.  So his sympathy moved him to<br>
try the dangerous passage in the dark.  He had entered the Heads<br>
seventeen times, and believed he knew the ground.  So he steered straight<br>
for the false opening, mistaking it for the true one.  He did not find<br>
out that he was wrong until it was too late.  There was no saving the<br>
ship.  The great seas swept her in and crushed her to splinters and<br>
rubbish upon the rock tushes at the base of the precipice.  Not one of<br>
all that fair and gracious company was ever seen again alive.  The tale<br>
is told to every stranger that passes the spot, and it will continue to<br>
be told to all that come, for generations; but it will never grow old,<br>
custom cannot stale it, the heart-break that is in it can never perish<br>
out of it.<br>
<br>
There were two hundred persons in the ship, and but one survived the<br>
disaster.  He was a sailor.  A huge sea flung him up the face of the<br>
precipice and stretched him on a narrow shelf of rock midway between the<br>
top and the bottom, and there he lay all night.  At any other time he<br>
would have lain there for the rest of his life, without chance of<br>
discovery; but the next morning the ghastly news swept through Sydney<br>
that the Duncan Dunbar had gone down in sight of home, and straightway<br>
the walls of the Heads were black with mourners; and one of these,<br>
stretching himself out over the precipice to spy out what might be seen<br>
below, discovered this miraculously preserved relic of the wreck.  Ropes<br>
were brought and the nearly impossible feat of rescuing the man was<br>
accomplished.  He was a person with a practical turn of mind, and he<br>
hired a hall in Sydney and exhibited himself at sixpence a head till he<br>
exhausted the output of the gold fields for that year.<br>
<br>
We entered and cast anchor, and in the morning went oh-ing and ah-ing in<br>
admiration up through the crooks and turns of the spacious and beautiful<br>
harbor--a harbor which is the darling of Sydney and the wonder of the<br>
world.  It is not surprising that the people are proud of it, nor that<br>
they put their enthusiasm into eloquent words.  A returning citizen asked<br>
me what I thought of it, and I testified with a cordiality which I judged<br>
would be up to the market rate.  I said it was beautiful--superbly<br>
beautiful.  Then by a natural impulse I gave God the praise.  The citizen<br>
did not seem altogether satisfied.  He said:<br>
<br>
"It is beautiful, of course it's beautiful--the Harbor; but that isn't<br>
all of it, it's only half of it; Sydney's the other half, and it takes<br>
both of them together to ring the supremacy-bell.  God made the Harbor,<br>
and that's all right; but Satan made Sydney."<br>
<br>
Of course I made an apology; and asked him to convey it to his friend.<br>
He was right about Sydney being half of it.  It would be beautiful<br>
without Sydney, but not above half as beautiful as it is now, with Sydney<br>
added.  It is shaped somewhat like an oak-leaf-a roomy sheet of lovely<br>
blue water, with narrow off-shoots of water running up into the country<br>
on both sides between long fingers of land, high wooden ridges with sides<br>
sloped like graves.  Handsome villas are perched here and there on these<br>
ridges, snuggling amongst the foliage, and one catches alluring glimpses<br>
of them as the ship swims by toward the city.  The city clothes a cluster<br>
of hills and a ruffle of neighboring ridges with its undulating masses of<br>
masonry, and out of these masses spring towers and spires and other<br>
architectural dignities and grandeurs that break the flowing lines and<br>
give picturesqueness to the general effect.<br>
<br>
The narrow inlets which I have mentioned go wandering out into the land<br>
everywhere and hiding themselves in it, and pleasure-launches are always<br>
exploring them with picnic parties on board.  It is said by trustworthy<br>
people that if you explore them all you will find that you have covered<br>
700 miles of water passage.  But there are liars everywhere this year,<br>
and they will double that when their works are in good going order.<br>
October was close at hand, spring was come.  It was really spring<br>
--everybody said so; but you could have sold it for summer in Canada, and<br>
nobody would have suspected.  It was the very weather that makes our home<br>
summers the perfection of climatic luxury; I mean, when you are out in<br>
the wood or by the sea.  But these people said it was cool, now--a person<br>
ought to see Sydney in the summer time if he wanted to know what warm<br>
weather is; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen hundred miles if he<br>
wanted to know what hot weather is.  They said that away up there toward<br>
the equator the hens laid fried eggs.  Sydney is the place to go to get<br>
information about other people's climates.  It seems to me that the<br>
occupation of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the pleasantest<br>
and most irresponsible trade there is.  The traveler can always find out<br>
anything he wants to, merely by asking.  He can get at all the facts, and<br>
more.  Everybody helps him, nobody hinders him.  Anybody who has an old<br>
fact in stock that is no longer negotiable in the domestic market will<br>
let him have it at his own price.  An accumulation of such goods is<br>
easily and quickly made.  They cost almost nothing and they bring par in<br>
the foreign market.  Travelers who come to America always freight up with<br>
the same old nursery tales that their predecessors selected, and they<br>
carry them back and always work them off without any trouble in the home<br>
market.<br>
<br>
If the climates of the world were determined by parallels of latitude,<br>
then we could know a place's climate by its position on the map; and so<br>
we should know that the climate of Sydney was the counterpart of the<br>
climate of Columbia, S. C., and of Little Rock, Arkansas, since Sydney is<br>
about the same distance south of the equator that those other towns are<br>
north of-it-thirty-four degrees.  But no, climate disregards the<br>
parallels of latitude.  In Arkansas they have a winter; in Sydney they<br>
have the name of it, but not the thing itself.  I have seen the ice in<br>
the Mississippi floating past the mouth of the Arkansas river; and at<br>
Memphis, but a little way above, the Mississippi has been frozen over,<br>
from bank to bank.  But they have never had a cold spell in Sydney which<br>
brought the mercury down to freezing point.  Once in a mid-winter day<br>
there, in the month of July, the mercury went down to 36 deg., and that<br>
remains the memorable "cold day" in the history of the town.  No doubt<br>
Little Rock has seen it below zero.  Once, in Sydney, in mid-summer,<br>
about New Year's Day, the mercury went up to 106 deg. in the shade, and<br>
that is Sydney's memorable hot day.  That would about tally with Little<br>
Rock's hottest day also, I imagine.  My Sydney figures are taken from a<br>
government report, and are trustworthy.  In the matter of summer weather<br>
Arkansas has no advantage over Sydney, perhaps, but when it comes to<br>
winter weather, that is another affair.  You could cut up an Arkansas<br>
winter into a hundred Sydney winters and have enough left for Arkansas<br>
and the poor.<br>
<br>
The whole narrow, hilly belt of the Pacific side of New South Wales has<br>
the climate of its capital--a mean winter temperature of 54 deg. and a<br>
mean summer one of 71 deg.  It is a climate which cannot be improved upon<br>
for healthfulness.  But the experts say that 90 deg. in New South Wales<br>
is harder to bear than 112 deg. in the neighboring colony of Victoria,<br>
because the atmosphere of the former is humid, and of the latter dry.<br>
The mean temperature of the southernmost point of New South Wales is the<br>
same as that of Nice--60 deg.--yet Nice is further from the equator by<br>
460 miles than is the former.<br>
<br>
But Nature is always stingy of perfect climates; stingier in the case of<br>
Australia than usual.  Apparently this vast continent has a really good<br>
climate nowhere but around the edges.<br>
<br>
If we look at a map of the world we are surprised to see how big<br>
Australia is.  It is about two-thirds as large as the United States was<br>
before we added Alaska.<br>
<br>
But where as one finds a sufficiently good climate and fertile land<br>
almost everywhere in the United States, it seems settled that inside of<br>
the Australian border-belt one finds many deserts and in spots a climate<br>
which nothing can stand except a few of the hardier kinds of rocks.  In<br>
effect, Australia is as yet unoccupied.  If you take a map of the United<br>
States and leave the Atlantic sea-board States in their places; also the<br>
fringe of Southern States from Florida west to the Mouth of the<br>
Mississippi; also a narrow, inhabited streak up the Mississippi half-way<br>
to its head waters; also a narrow, inhabited border along the Pacific<br>
coast: then take a brushful of paint and obliterate the whole remaining<br>
mighty stretch of country that lies between the Atlantic States and the<br>
Pacific-coast strip, your map will look like the latest map of Australia.<br>
<br>
This stupendous blank is hot, not to say torrid; a part of it is fertile,<br>
the rest is desert; it is not liberally watered; it has no towns.  One<br>
has only to cross the mountains of New South Wales and descend into the<br>
westward-lying regions to find that he has left the choice climate behind<br>
him, and found a new one of a quite different character.  In fact, he<br>
would not know by the thermometer that he was not in the blistering<br>
Plains of India.  Captain Sturt, the great explorer, gives us a sample of<br>
the heat.<br>
<br>
     "The wind, which had been blowing all the morning from the N.E.,<br>
     increased to a heavy gale, and I shall never forget its withering<br>
     effect.  I sought shelter behind a large gum-tree, but the blasts of<br>
     heat were so terrific that I wondered the very grass did not take<br>
     fire.  This really was nothing ideal: everything both animate and<br>
     inanimate gave way before it; the horses stood with their backs to<br>
     the wind and their noses to the ground, without the muscular<br>
     strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and the leaves<br>
     of the trees under which we were sitting fell like a snow shower<br>
     around us.  At noon I took a thermometer graded to 127 deg., out of<br>
     my box, and observed that the mercury was up to 125.  Thinking that<br>
     it had been unduly influenced, I put it in the fork of a tree close<br>
     to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the sun.  I went to examine<br>
     it about an hour afterwards, when I found the mercury had risen to<br>
     the-top of the instrument and had burst the bulb, a circumstance<br>
     that I believe no traveler has ever before had to record.  I cannot<br>
     find language to convey to the reader's mind an idea of the intense<br>
     and oppressive nature of the heat that prevailed."<br>
<br>
That hot wind sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and brings with it what is<br>
called a "dust-storm."  It is said that most Australian towns are<br>
acquainted with the dust-storm.  I think I know what it is like, for the<br>
following description by Mr. Gape tallies very well with the alkali<br>
duststorm of Nevada, if you leave out the "shovel" part.  Still the<br>
shovel part is a pretty important part, and seems to indicate that my<br>
Nevada storm is but a poor thing, after all.<br>
<br>
     "As we proceeded the altitude became less, and the heat<br>
     proportionately greater until we reached Dubbo, which is only 600<br>
     feet above sea-level.  It is a pretty town, built on an extensive<br>
     plain .  .  .  .  After the effects of a shower of rain have passed<br>
     away the surface of the ground crumbles into a thick layer of dust,<br>
     and occasionally, when the wind is in a particular quarter, it is<br>
     lifted bodily from the ground in one long opaque cloud.  In the<br>
     midst of such a storm nothing can be seen a few yards ahead, and the<br>
     unlucky person who happens to be out at the time is compelled to<br>
     seek the nearest retreat at hand.  When the thrifty housewife sees<br>
     in the distance the dark column advancing in a steady whirl towards<br>
     her house, she closes the doors and windows with all expedition.  A<br>
     drawing-room, the window of which has been carelessly left open<br>
     during a dust-storm, is indeed an extraordinary sight.  A lady who<br>
     has resided in Dubbo for some years says that the dust lies so thick<br>
     on the carpet that it is necessary to use a shovel to remove it."<br>
<br>
And probably a wagon.  I was mistaken; I have not seen a proper<br>
duststorm.  To my mind the exterior aspects and character of Australia<br>
are fascinating things to look at and think about, they are so strange,<br>
so weird, so new, so uncommonplace, such a startling and interesting<br>
contrast to the other sections of the planet, the sections that are known<br>
to us all, familiar to us all.  In the matter of particulars--a detail<br>
here, a detail there--we have had the choice climate of New South Wales'<br>
seacoast; we have had the Australian heat as furnished by Captain Sturt;<br>
we have had the wonderful dust-storm; and we have considered the<br>
phenomenon of an almost empty hot wilderness half as big as the United<br>
States, with a narrow belt of civilization, population, and good climate<br>
around it.<br>

CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
Everything human is pathetic.  The secret source of Humor itself is not<br>
joy but sorrow.  There is no humor in heaven.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
Captain Cook found Australia in 1770, and eighteen years later the<br>
British Government began to transport convicts to it.  Altogether, New<br>
South Wales received 83,000 in 53 years.  The convicts wore heavy chains;<br>
they were ill-fed and badly treated by the officers set over them; they<br>
were heavily punished for even slight infractions of the rules; "the<br>
cruelest discipline ever known" is one historian's description of their<br>
life.--[The Story of Australasia.  J. S. Laurie.]<br>
<br>
English law was hard-hearted in those days.  For trifling offenses which<br>
in our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days' confinement,<br>
men, women, and boys were sent to this other end of the earth to serve<br>
terms of seven and fourteen years; and for serious crimes they were<br>
transported for life.  Children were sent to the penal colonies for seven<br>
years for stealing a rabbit!<br>
<br>
When I was in London twenty-three years ago there was a new penalty in<br>
force for diminishing garroting and wife-beating--25 lashes on the bare<br>
back with the cat-o'-nine-tails.  It was said that this terrible<br>
punishment was able to bring the stubbornest ruffians to terms; and that<br>
no man had been found with grit enough to keep his emotions to himself<br>
beyond the ninth blow; as a rule the man shrieked earlier.  That penalty<br>
had a great and wholesome effect upon the garroters and wife-beaters; but<br>
humane modern London could not endure it; it got its law rescinded.  Many<br>
a bruised and battered English wife has since had occasion to deplore<br>
that cruel achievement of sentimental "humanity."<br>
<br>
Twenty-five lashes!  In Australia and Tasmania they gave a convict fifty<br>
for almost any little offense; and sometimes a brutal officer would add<br>
fifty, and then another fifty, and so on, as long as the sufferer could<br>
endure the torture and live.  In Tasmania I read the entry, in an old<br>
manuscript official record, of a case where a convict was given three<br>
hundred lashes--for stealing some silver spoons.  And men got more than<br>
that, sometimes.  Who handled the cat?  Often it was another convict;<br>
sometimes it was the culprit's dearest comrade; and he had to lay on with<br>
all his might; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for his mercy<br>
--for he was under watch--and yet not do his friend any good: the friend<br>
would be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the matter of<br>
full punishment.<br>
<br>
The convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable, and suicide so difficult<br>
to accomplish that once or twice despairing men got together and drew<br>
straws to determine which of them should kill another of the group--this<br>
murder to secure death to the perpetrator and to the witnesses of it by<br>
the hand of the hangman!<br>
<br>
The incidents quoted above are mere hints, mere suggestions of what<br>
convict life was like--they are but a couple of details tossed into view<br>
out of a shoreless sea of such; or, to change the figure, they are but a<br>
pair of flaming steeples photographed from a point which hides from sight<br>
the burning city which stretches away from their bases on every hand.<br>
<br>
Some of the convicts--indeed, a good many of them--were very bad people,<br>
even for that day; but the most of them were probably not noticeably<br>
worse than the average of the people they left behind them at home.  We<br>
must believe this; we cannot avoid it.  We are obliged to believe that a<br>
nation that could look on, unmoved, and see starving or freezing women<br>
hanged for stealing twenty-six cents' worth of bacon or rags, and boys<br>
snatched from their mothers, and men from their families, and sent to the<br>
other side of the world for long terms of years for similar trifling<br>
offenses, was a nation to whom the term "civilized" could not in any<br>
large way be applied.  And we must also believe that a nation that knew,<br>
during more than forty years, what was happening to those exiles and was<br>
still content with it, was not advancing in any showy way toward a higher<br>
grade of civilization.<br>
<br>
If we look into the characters and conduct of the officers and gentlemen<br>
who had charge of the convicts and attended to their backs and stomachs,<br>
we must grant again that as between the convict and his masters, and<br>
between both and the nation at home, there was a quite noticeable<br>
monotony of sameness.<br>
<br>
Four years had gone by, and many convicts had come.  Respectable settlers<br>
were beginning to arrive.  These two classes of colonists had to be<br>
protected, in case of trouble among themselves or with the natives.  It<br>
is proper to mention the natives, though they could hardly count they<br>
were so scarce.  At a time when they had not as yet begun to be much<br>
disturbed--not as yet being in the way--it was estimated that in New<br>
South Wales there was but one native to 45,000 acres of territory.<br>
<br>
People had to be protected.  Officers of the regular army did not want<br>
this service--away off there where neither honor nor distinction was to<br>
be gained.  So England recruited and officered a kind of militia force of<br>
1,000 uniformed civilians called the "New South Wales Corps" and shipped<br>
it.<br>
<br>
This was the worst blow of all.  The colony fairly staggered under it.<br>
The Corps was an object-lesson of the moral condition of England outside<br>
of the jails.  The colonists trembled.  It was feared that next there<br>
would be an importation of the nobility.<br>
<br>
In those early days the colony was non-supporting.  All the necessaries<br>
of life--food, clothing, and all--were sent out from England, and kept in<br>
great government store-houses, and given to the convicts and sold to the<br>
settlers--sold at a trifling advance upon cost.  The Corps saw its<br>
opportunity.  Its officers went into commerce, and in a most lawless way.<br>
They went to importing rum, and also to manufacturing it in private<br>
stills, in defiance of the government's commands and protests.  They<br>
leagued themselves together and ruled the market; they boycotted the<br>
government and the other dealers; they established a close monopoly and<br>
kept it strictly in their own hands.  When a vessel arrived with spirits,<br>
they allowed nobody to buy but themselves, and they forced the owner to<br>
sell to them at a price named by themselves--and it was always low<br>
enough.  They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and sold<br>
it at an average of ten.  They made rum the currency of the country--for<br>
there was little or no money--and they maintained their devastating hold<br>
and kept the colony under their heel for eighteen or twenty years before<br>
they were finally conquered and routed by the government.<br>
<br>
Meantime, they had spread intemperance everywhere.  And they had squeezed<br>
farm after farm out of the settlers hands for rum, and thus had<br>
bountifully enriched themselves.  When a farmer was caught in the last<br>
agonies of thirst they took advantage of him and sweated him for a drink.<br>
In one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two dollars for a<br>
piece of property which was sold some years later for $100,000.<br>
When the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it was discovered<br>
that the land was specially fitted for the wool-culture.  Prosperity<br>
followed, commerce with the world began, by and by rich mines of the<br>
noble metals were opened, immigrants flowed in, capital likewise.  The<br>
result is the great and wealthy and enlightened commonwealth of New South<br>
Wales.<br>
<br>
It is a country that is rich in mines, wool ranches, trams, railways,<br>
steamship lines, schools, newspapers, botanical gardens, art galleries,<br>
libraries, museums, hospitals, learned societies; it is the hospitable<br>
home of every species of culture and of every species of material<br>
enterprise, and there is a, church at every man's door, and a race-track<br>
over the way.<br>

CHAPTER XI.<br>
<br>
We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is<br>
in it--and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot<br>
stove-lid.  She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again--and that is<br>
well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
All English-speaking colonies are made up of lavishly hospitable people,<br>
and New South Wales and its capital are like the rest in this.  The<br>
English-speaking colony of the United States of America is always<br>
called lavishly hospitable by the English traveler.  As to the other<br>
English-speaking colonies throughout the world from Canada all around, I<br>
know by experience that the description fits them.  I will not go more<br>
particularly into this matter, for I find that when writers try to<br>
distribute their gratitude here and there and yonder by detail they run<br>
across difficulties and do some ungraceful stumbling.<br>
<br>
Mr. Gane ("New South Wales and Victoria in 1885 "), tried to distribute<br>
his gratitude, and was not lucky:<br>
<br>
     "The inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality.  The<br>
     treatment which we experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted<br>
     people will help more than anything else to make us recollect with<br>
     pleasure our stay amongst them.  In the character of hosts and<br>
     hostesses they excel.  The 'new chum' needs only the<br>
     acquaintanceship of one of their number, and he becomes at once the<br>
     happy recipient of numerous complimentary invitations and thoughtful<br>
     kindnesses.  Of the towns it has been our good fortune to visit,<br>
     none have portrayed home so faithfully as Sydney."<br>
<br>
Nobody could say it finer than that.  If he had put in his cork then, and<br>
stayed away from Dubbo----but no; heedless man, he pulled it again.<br>
Pulled it when he was away along in his book, and his memory of what he<br>
had said about Sydney had grown dim:<br>
<br>
     "We cannot quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying, in<br>
     warm praise, to the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its<br>
     inhabitants.  Sydney, though well deserving the character it bears<br>
     of its kindly treatment of strangers, possesses a little formality<br>
     and reserve.  In Dubbo, on the contrary, though the same congenial<br>
     manners prevail, there is a pleasing degree of respectful<br>
     familiarity which gives the town a homely comfort not often met with<br>
     elsewhere.  In laying on one side our pen we feel contented in<br>
     having been able, though so late in this work, to bestow a<br>
     panegyric, however unpretentious, on a town which, though possessing<br>
     no picturesque natural surroundings, nor interesting architectural<br>
     productions, has yet a body of citizens whose hearts cannot but<br>
     obtain for their town a reputation for benevolence and<br>
     kind-heartedness."<br>
<br>
I wonder what soured him on Sydney.  It seems strange that a pleasing<br>
degree of three or four fingers of respectful familiarity should fill a<br>
man up and give him the panegyrics so bad.  For he has them, the worst<br>
way--any one can see that.  A man who is perfectly at himself does not<br>
throw cold detraction at people's architectural productions and<br>
picturesque surroundings, and let on that what he prefers is a Dubbonese<br>
dust-storm and a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity, No, these are<br>
old, old symptoms; and when they appear we know that the man has got the<br>
panegyrics.<br>
<br>
Sydney has a population of 400,000.  When a stranger from America steps<br>
ashore there, the first thing that strikes him is that the place is eight<br>
or nine times as large as he was expecting it to be; and the next thing<br>
that strikes him is that it is an English city with American trimmings.<br>
Later on, in Melbourne, he will find the American trimmings still more in<br>
evidence; there, even the architecture will often suggest America; a<br>
photograph of its stateliest business street might be passed upon him for<br>
a picture of the finest street in a large American city.  I was told that<br>
the most of the fine residences were the city residences of squatters.<br>
The name seemed out of focus somehow.  When the explanation came, it<br>
offered a new instance of the curious changes which words, as well as<br>
animals, undergo through change of habitat and climate.  With us, when<br>
you speak of a squatter you are always supposed to be speaking of a poor<br>
man, but in Australia when you speak of a squatter you are supposed to be<br>
speaking of a millionaire; in America the word indicates the possessor of<br>
a few acres and a doubtful title, in Australia it indicates a man whose<br>
landfront is as long as a railroad, and whose title has been perfected in<br>
one way or another; in America the word indicates a man who owns a dozen<br>
head of live stock, in Australia a man who owns anywhere from fifty<br>
thousand up to half a million head; in America the word indicates a man<br>
who is obscure and not important, in Australia a man who is prominent and<br>
of the first importance; in America you take off your hat to no squatter,<br>
in Australia you do; in America if your uncle is a squatter you keep it<br>
dark, in Australia you advertise it; in America if your friend is a<br>
squatter nothing comes of it, but with a squatter for your friend in<br>
Australia you may sup with kings if there are any around.<br>
<br>
In Australia it takes about two acres and a half of pastureland (some<br>
people say twice as many), to support a sheep; and when the squatter has<br>
half a million sheep his private domain is about as large as Rhode<br>
Island, to speak in general terms.  His annual wool crop may be worth a<br>
quarter or a half million dollars.<br>
<br>
He will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some other of the<br>
large cities, and make occasional trips to his sheep-kingdom several<br>
hundred miles away in the great plains to look after his battalions of<br>
riders and shepherds and other hands.  He has a commodious dwelling out<br>
there, and if he approve of you he will invite you to spend a week in it,<br>
and will make you at home and comfortable, and let you see the great<br>
industry in all its details, and feed you and slake you and smoke you<br>
with the best that money can buy.<br>
<br>
On at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable town, with<br>
all the various businesses and occupations that go to make an important<br>
town; and the town and the land it stands upon are the property of the<br>
squatters.  I have seen that town, and it is not unlikely that there are<br>
other squatter-owned towns in Australia.<br>
<br>
Australia supplies the world not only with fine wool, but with mutton<br>
also.  The modern invention of cold storage and its application in ships<br>
has created this great trade.  In Sydney I visited a huge establishment<br>
where they kill and clean and solidly freeze a thousand sheep a day, for<br>
shipment to England.<br>
<br>
The Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably from Americans,<br>
either in dress, carriage, ways, pronunciation, inflections, or general<br>
appearance.  There were fleeting and subtle suggestions of their English<br>
origin, but these were not pronounced enough, as a rule, to catch one's<br>
attention.  The people have easy and cordial manners from the beginning<br>
--from the moment that the introduction is completed.  This is American.<br>
To put it in another way, it is English friendliness with the English<br>
shyness and self-consciousness left out.<br>
<br>
Now and then--but this is rare--one hears such words as piper for paper,<br>
lydy for lady, and tyble for table fall from lips whence one would not<br>
expect such pronunciations to come.  There is a superstition prevalent in<br>
Sydney that this pronunciation is an Australianism, but people who have<br>
been "home"--as the native reverently and lovingly calls England--know<br>
better.  It is "costermonger."  All over Australasia this pronunciation<br>
is nearly as common among servants as it is in London among the<br>
uneducated and the partially educated of all sorts and conditions of<br>
people.  That mislaid 'y' is rather striking when a person gets enough of<br>
it into a short sentence to enable it to show up.  In the hotel in Sydney<br>
the chambermaid said, one morning:<br>
<br>
"The tyble is set, and here is the piper; and if the lydy is ready I'll<br>
tell the wyter to bring up the breakfast."<br>
<br>
I have made passing mention, a moment ago, of the native Australasian's<br>
custom of speaking of England as "home."  It was always pretty to hear<br>
it, and often it was said in an unconsciously caressing way that made it<br>
touching; in a way which transmuted a sentiment into an embodiment, and<br>
made one seem to see Australasia as a young girl stroking mother<br>
England's old gray head.<br>
<br>
In the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and unembarrassed;<br>
it is without stiffness or restraint.  This does not remind one of<br>
England so much as it does of America.  But Australasia is strictly<br>
democratic, and reserves and restraints are things that are bred by<br>
differences of rank.<br>
<br>
English and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and responsive.<br>
Where masses of people are gathered together in England, caste is<br>
submerged, and with it the English reserve; equality exists for the<br>
moment, and every individual is free; so free from any consciousness of<br>
fetters, indeed, that the Englishman's habit of watching himself and<br>
guarding himself against any injudicious exposure of his feelings is<br>
forgotten, and falls into abeyance--and to such a degree indeed, that he<br>
will bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to--an exhibition of<br>
daring which is unusual elsewhere in the world.<br>
<br>
But it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he is by himself,<br>
or when the company present is small and new to him.  He is on his guard<br>
then, and his natural reserve is to the fore.  This has given him the<br>
false reputation of being without humor and without the appreciation of<br>
humor.<br>
<br>
Americans are not Englishmen, and American humor is not English humor;<br>
but both the American and his humor had their origin in England, and have<br>
merely undergone changes brought about by changed conditions and a new<br>
environment.  About the best humorous speeches I have yet heard were a<br>
couple that were made in Australia at club suppers--one of them by an<br>
Englishman, the other by an Australian.<br>

CHAPTER XII.<br>
<br>
There are those who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him frivolous and<br>
shallow: Yet it was the schoolboy who said "Faith is believing what you<br>
know ain't so."<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
In Sydney I had a large dream, and in the course of talk I told it to a<br>
missionary from India who was on his way to visit some relatives in New<br>
Zealand.  I dreamed that the visible universe is the physical person of<br>
God; that the vast worlds that we see twinkling millions of miles apart<br>
in the fields of space are the blood corpuscles in His veins; and that we<br>
and the other creatures are the microbes that charge with multitudinous<br>
life the corpuscles.<br>
<br>
Mr. X., the missionary, considered the dream awhile, then said:<br>
<br>
     "It is not surpassable for magnitude, since its metes and bounds are<br>
     the metes and bounds of the universe itself; and it seems to me that<br>
     it almost accounts for a thing which is otherwise nearly<br>
     unaccountable--the origin of the sacred legends of the Hindoos.<br>
     Perhaps they dream them, and then honestly believe them to be divine<br>
     revelations of fact.  It looks like that, for the legends are built<br>
     on so vast a scale that it does not seem reasonable that plodding<br>
     priests would happen upon such colossal fancies when awake."<br>
<br>
He told some of the legends, and said that they were implicitly believed<br>
by all classes of Hindoos, including those of high social position and<br>
intelligence; and he said that this universal credulity was a great<br>
hindrance to the missionary in his work.  Then he said something like<br>
this:<br>
<br>
     "At home, people wonder why Christianity does not make faster<br>
     progress in India.  They hear that the Indians believe easily, and<br>
     that they have a natural trust in miracles and give them a<br>
     hospitable reception.  Then they argue like this: since the Indian<br>
     believes easily, place Christianity before them and they must<br>
     believe; confirm its truths by the biblical miracles, and they will<br>
     no longer doubt, The natural deduction is, that as Christianity<br>
     makes but indifferent progress in India, the fault is with us: we<br>
     are not fortunate in presenting the doctrines and the miracles.<br>
<br>
     "But the truth is, we are not by any means so well equipped as they<br>
     think.  We have not the easy task that they imagine.  To use a<br>
     military figure, we are sent against the enemy with good powder in<br>
     our guns, but only wads for bullets; that is to say, our miracles<br>
     are not effective; the Hindoos do not care for them; they have more<br>
     extraordinary ones of their own.  All the details of their own<br>
     religion are proven and established by miracles; the details of ours<br>
     must be proven in the same way.  When I first began my work in India<br>
     I greatly underestimated the difficulties thus put upon my task.  A<br>
     correction was not long in coming.  I thought as our friends think<br>
     at home--that to prepare my childlike wonder-lovers to listen with<br>
     favor to my grave message I only needed to charm the way to it with<br>
     wonders, marvels, miracles.  With full confidence I told the wonders<br>
     performed by Samson, the strongest man that had ever lived--for so I<br>
     called him.<br>
<br>
     "At first I saw lively anticipation and strong interest in the faces<br>
     of my people, but as I moved along from incident to incident of the<br>
     great story, I was distressed to see that I was steadily losing the<br>
     sympathy of my audience.  I could not understand it.  It was a<br>
     surprise to me, and a disappointment.  Before I was through, the<br>
     fading sympathy had paled to indifference.  Thence to the end the<br>
     indifference remained; I was not able to make any impression upon<br>
     it.<br>
<br>
     "A good old Hindoo gentleman told me where my trouble lay.  He said<br>
     'We Hindoos recognize a god by the work of his hands--we accept no<br>
     other testimony.  Apparently, this is also the rule with you<br>
     Christians.  And we know when a man has his power from a god by the<br>
     fact that he does things which he could not do, as a man, with the<br>
     mere powers of a man.  Plainly, this is the Christian's way also, of<br>
     knowing when a man is working by a god's power and not by his own.<br>
     You saw that there was a supernatural property in the hair of<br>
     Samson; for you perceived that when his hair was gone he was as<br>
     other men.  It is our way, as I have said.  There are many nations<br>
     in the world, and each group of nations has its own gods, and will<br>
     pay no worship to the gods of the others.  Each group believes its<br>
     own gods to be strongest, and it will not exchange them except for<br>
     gods that shall be proven to be their superiors in power.  Man is<br>
     but a weak creature, and needs the help of gods--he cannot do<br>
     without it.  Shall he place his fate in the hands of weak gods when<br>
     there may be stronger ones to be found?  That would be foolish.  No,<br>
     if he hear of gods that are stronger than his own, he should not<br>
     turn a deaf ear, for it is not a light matter that is at stake.  How<br>
     then shall he determine which gods are the stronger, his own or<br>
     those that preside over the concerns of other nations?  By comparing<br>
     the known works of his own gods with the works of those others;<br>
     there is no other way.  Now, when we make this comparison, we are<br>
     not drawn towards the gods of any other nation.  Our gods are shown<br>
     by their works to be the strongest, the most powerful.  The<br>
     Christians have but few gods, and they are new--new, and not strong;<br>
     as it seems to us.  They will increase in number, it is true, for<br>
     this has happened with all gods, but that time is far away, many<br>
     ages and decades of ages away, for gods multiply slowly, as is meet<br>
     for beings to whom a thousand years is but a single moment.  Our own<br>
     gods have been born millions of years apart.  The process is slow,<br>
     the gathering of strength and power is similarly slow.  In the slow<br>
     lapse of the ages the steadily accumulating power of our gods has at<br>
     last become prodigious.  We have a thousand proofs of this in the<br>
     colossal character of their personal acts and the acts of ordinary<br>
     men to whom they have given supernatural qualities.  To your Samson<br>
     was given supernatural power, and when he broke the withes, and slew<br>
     the thousands with the jawbone of an ass, and carried away the<br>
     gate's of the city upon his shoulders, you were amazed--and also<br>
     awed, for you recognized the divine source of his strength.  But it<br>
     could not profit to place these things before your Hindoo<br>
     congregation and invite their wonder; for they would compare them<br>
     with the deed done by Hanuman, when our gods infused their divine<br>
     strength into his muscles; and they would be indifferent to them--as<br>
     you saw.  In the old, old times, ages and ages gone by, when our god<br>
     Rama was warring with the demon god of Ceylon, Rama bethought him to<br>
     bridge the sea and connect Ceylon with India, so that his armies<br>
     might pass easily over; and he sent his general, Hanuman, inspired<br>
     like your own Samson with divine strength, to bring the materials<br>
     for the bridge.  In two days Hanuman strode fifteen hundred miles,<br>
     to the Himalayas, and took upon his shoulder a range of those lofty<br>
     mountains two hundred miles long, and started with it toward Ceylon.<br>
     It was in the night; and, as he passed along the plain, the people<br>
     of Govardhun heard the thunder of his tread and felt the earth<br>
     rocking under it, and they ran out, and there, with their snowy<br>
     summits piled to heaven, they saw the Himalayas passing by.  And as<br>
     this huge continent swept along overshadowing the earth, upon its<br>
     slopes they discerned the twinkling lights of a thousand sleeping<br>
     villages, and it was as if the constellations were filing in<br>
     procession through the sky.  While they were looking, Hanuman<br>
     stumbled, and a small ridge of red sandstone twenty miles long was<br>
     jolted loose and fell.  Half of its length has wasted away in the<br>
     course of the ages, but the other ten miles of it remain in the<br>
     plain by Govardhun to this day as proof of the might of the<br>
     inspiration of our gods.  You must know, yourself, that Hanuman<br>
     could not have carried those mountains to Ceylon except by the<br>
     strength of the gods.  You know that it was not done by his own<br>
     strength, therefore, you know that it was done by the strength of<br>
     the gods, just as you know that Samson carried the gates by the<br>
     divine strength and not by his own.  I think you must concede two<br>
     things:  First, That in carrying the gates of the city upon his<br>
     shoulders, Samson did not establish the superiority of his gods over<br>
     ours; secondly, That his feat is not supported by any but verbal<br>
     evidence, while Hanuman's is not only supported by verbal evidence,<br>
     but this evidence is confirmed, established, proven, by visible,<br>
     tangible evidence, which is the strongest of all testimony.  We have<br>
     the sandstone ridge, and while it remains we cannot doubt, and shall<br>
     not.  Have you the gates?'"<br>

The timid man yearns for full value and asks a tenth.  The bold man<br>
strikes for double value and compromises on par.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
One is sure to be struck by the liberal way in which Australasia spends<br>
money upon public works--such as legislative buildings, town halls,<br>
hospitals, asylums, parks, and botanical gardens.  I should say that<br>
where minor towns in America spend a hundred dollars on the town hall and<br>
on public parks and gardens, the like towns in Australasia spend a<br>
thousand.  And I think that this ratio will hold good in the matter of<br>
hospitals, also.  I have seen a costly and well-equipped, and<br>
architecturally handsome hospital in an Australian village of fifteen<br>
hundred inhabitants.  It was built by private funds furnished by the<br>
villagers and the neighboring planters, and its running expenses were<br>
drawn from the same sources.  I suppose it would be hard to match this in<br>
any country.  This village was about to close a contract for lighting its<br>
streets with the electric light, when I was there.  That is ahead of<br>
London.  London is still obscured by gas--gas pretty widely scattered,<br>
too, in some of the districts; so widely indeed, that except on moonlight<br>
nights it is difficult to find the gas lamps.<br>
<br>
The botanical garden of Sydney covers thirty-eight acres, beautifully<br>
laid out and rich with the spoil of all the lands and all the climes of<br>
the world.  The garden is on high ground in the middle of the town,<br>
overlooking the great harbor, and it adjoins the spacious grounds of<br>
Government House--fifty-six acres; and at hand also, is a recreation<br>
ground containing eighty-two acres.  In addition, there are the<br>
zoological gardens, the race-course, and the great cricket-grounds where<br>
the international matches are played.  Therefore there is plenty of room<br>
for reposeful lazying and lounging, and for exercise too, for such as<br>
like that kind of work.<br>
<br>
There are four specialties attainable in the way of social pleasure.  If<br>
you enter your name on the Visitor's Book at Government House you will<br>
receive an invitation to the next ball that takes place there, if nothing<br>
can be proven against you.  And it will be very pleasant; for you will<br>
see everybody except the Governor, and add a number of acquaintances and<br>
several friends to your list.  The Governor will be in England.  He<br>
always is.  The continent has four or five governors, and I do not know<br>
how many it takes to govern the outlying archipelago; but anyway you will<br>
not see them.  When they are appointed they come out from England and get<br>
inaugurated, and give a ball, and help pray for rain, and get aboard ship<br>
and go back home.  And so the Lieutenant-Governor has to do all the work.<br>
I was in Australasia three months and a half, and saw only one Governor.<br>
The others were at home.<br>
<br>
The Australasian Governor would not be so restless, perhaps, if he had a<br>
war, or a veto, or something like that to call for his reserve-energies,<br>
but he hasn't.  There isn't any war, and there isn't any veto in his<br>
hands.  And so there is really little or nothing doing in his line.  The<br>
country governs itself, and prefers to do it; and is so strenuous about<br>
it and so jealous of its independence that it grows restive if even the<br>
Imperial Government at home proposes to help; and so the Imperial veto,<br>
while a fact, is yet mainly a name.<br>
<br>
Thus the Governor's functions are much more limited than are a Governor's<br>
functions with us.  And therefore more fatiguing.  He is the apparent<br>
head of the State, he is the real head of Society.  He represents<br>
culture, refinement, elevated sentiment, polite life, religion; and by<br>
his example he propagates these, and they spread and flourish and bear<br>
good fruit.  He creates the fashion, and leads it.  His ball is the ball<br>
of balls, and his countenance makes the horse-race thrive.<br>
<br>
He is usually a lord, and this is well; for his position compels him to<br>
lead an expensive life, and an English lord is generally well equipped<br>
for that.<br>
<br>
Another of Sydney's social pleasures is the visit to the Admiralty House;<br>
which is nobly situated on high ground overlooking the water.  The trim<br>
boats of the service convey the guests thither; and there, or on board<br>
the flag-ship, they have the duplicate of the hospitalities of Government<br>
House.  The Admiral commanding a station in British waters is a magnate<br>
of the first degree, and he is sumptuously housed, as becomes the dignity<br>
of his office.<br>
<br>
Third in the list of special pleasures is the tour of the harbor in a<br>
fine steam pleasure-launch.  Your richer friends own boats of this kind,<br>
and they will invite you, and the joys of the trip will make a long day<br>
seem short.<br>
<br>
And finally comes the shark-fishing.  Sydney Harbor is populous with the<br>
finest breeds of man-eating sharks in the world.  Some people make their<br>
living catching them; for the Government pays a cash bounty on them.  The<br>
larger the shark the larger the bounty, and some of the sharks are twenty<br>
feet long.  You not only get the bounty, but everything that is in the<br>
shark belongs to you.  Sometimes the contents are quite valuable.<br>
<br>
The shark is the swiftest fish that swims.  The speed of the fastest<br>
steamer afloat is poor compared to his.  And he is a great gad-about, and<br>
roams far and wide in the oceans, and visits the shores of all of them,<br>
ultimately, in the course of his restless excursions.  I have a tale to<br>
tell now, which has not as yet been in print.  In 1870 a young stranger<br>
arrived in Sydney, and set about finding something to do; but he knew no<br>
one, and brought no recommendations, and the result was that he got no<br>
employment.  He had aimed high, at first, but as time and his money<br>
wasted away he grew less and less exacting, until at last he was willing<br>
to serve in the humblest capacities if so he might get bread and shelter.<br>
But luck was still against him; he could find no opening of any sort.<br>
Finally his money was all gone.  He walked the streets all day, thinking;<br>
he walked them all night, thinking, thinking, and growing hungrier and<br>
hungrier.  At dawn he found himself well away from the town and drifting<br>
aimlessly along the harbor shore.  As he was passing by a nodding<br>
shark-fisher the man looked up and said----<br>
<br>
"Say, young fellow, take my line a spell, and change my luck for me."<br>
<br>
"How do you know I won't make it worse?"<br>
<br>
"Because you can't.  It has been at its worst all night.  If you can't<br>
change it, no harm's done; if you do change it, it's for the better,<br>
of course.  Come."<br>
<br>
"All right, what will you give?"<br>
<br>
"I'll give you the shark, if you catch one."<br>
<br>
"And I will eat it, bones and all.  Give me the line."<br>
<br>
"Here you are.  I will get away, now, for awhile, so that my luck won't<br>
spoil yours; for many and many a time I've noticed that if----there, pull<br>
in, pull in, man, you've got a bite!  I knew how it would be.  Why, I<br>
knew you for a born son of luck the minute I saw you.  All right--he's<br>
landed."<br>
<br>
It was an unusually large shark--"a full nineteen-footer," the fisherman<br>
said, as he laid the creature open with his knife.<br>
<br>
"Now you rob him, young man, while I step to my hamper for a fresh bait.<br>
There's generally something in them worth going for.  You've changed my<br>
luck, you see.  But my goodness, I hope you haven't changed your own."<br>
<br>
"Oh, it wouldn't matter; don't worry about that.  Get your bait.  I'll<br>
rob him."<br>
<br>
When the fisherman got back the young man had just finished washing his<br>
hands in the bay, and was starting away.<br>
<br>
"What, you are not going?"<br>
<br>
"Yes.  Good-bye."<br>
<br>
"But what about your shark?"<br>
<br>
"The shark?  Why, what use is he to me?"<br>
<br>
"What use is he?  I like that.  Don't you know that we can go and report<br>
him to Government, and you'll get a clean solid eighty shillings bounty?<br>
Hard cash, you know.  What do you think about it now?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, well, you can collect it."<br>
<br>
"And keep it?  Is that what you mean?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
"Well, this is odd.  You're one of those sort they call eccentrics, I<br>
judge.  The saying is, you mustn't judge a man by his clothes, and I'm<br>
believing it now.  Why yours are looking just ratty, don't you know; and<br>
yet you must be rich."<br>
<br>
"I am."<br>
<br>
The young man walked slowly back to the town, deeply musing as he went.<br>
He halted a moment in front of the best restaurant, then glanced at his<br>
clothes and passed on, and got his breakfast at a "stand-up."  There was<br>
a good deal of it, and it cost five shillings.  He tendered a sovereign,<br>
got his change, glanced at his silver, muttered to himself, "There isn't<br>
enough to buy clothes with," and went his way.<br>
<br>
At half-past nine the richest wool-broker in Sydney was sitting in his<br>
morning-room at home, settling his breakfast with the morning paper.  A<br>
servant put his head in and said:<br>
<br>
"There's a sundowner at the door wants to see you, sir."<br>
<br>
"What do you bring that kind of a message here for?  Send him about his<br>
business."<br>
<br>
"He won't go, sir.  I've tried."<br>
<br>
"He won't go?  That's--why, that's unusual.  He's one of two things,<br>
then: he's a remarkable person, or he's crazy.  Is he crazy?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir.  He don't look it."<br>
<br>
"Then he's remarkable.  What does he say he wants?"<br>
<br>
"He won't tell, sir; only says it's very important."<br>
<br>
"And won't go.  Does he say he won't go?"<br>
<br>
"Says he'll stand there till he sees you, sir, if it's all day."<br>
<br>
"And yet isn't crazy.  Show him up."<br>
<br>
The sundowner was shown in.  The broker said to himself, "No, he's not<br>
crazy; that is easy to see; so he must be the other thing."<br>
<br>
Then aloud, "Well, my good fellow, be quick about it; don't waste any<br>
words; what is it you want?"<br>
<br>
"I want to borrow a hundred thousand pounds."<br>
<br>
"Scott!  (It's a mistake; he is crazy .  .  .  .  No--he can't be--not<br>
with that eye.) Why, you take my breath away.  Come, who are you?"<br>
<br>
"Nobody that you know."<br>
<br>
"What is your name?"<br>
<br>
"Cecil Rhodes."<br>
<br>
"No, I don't remember hearing the name before.  Now then--just for<br>
curiosity's sake--what has sent you to me on this extraordinary errand?"<br>
<br>
"The intention to make a hundred thousand pounds for you and as much for<br>
myself within the next sixty days."<br>
<br>
"Well, well, well.  It is the most extraordinary idea that--sit down--you<br>
interest me.  And somehow you--well, you fascinate me; I think that that<br>
is about the word.  And it isn't your proposition--no, that doesn't<br>
fascinate me; it's something else, I don't quite know what; something<br>
that's born in you and oozes out of you, I suppose.  Now then just for<br>
curiosity's sake again, nothing more: as I understand it, it is your<br>
desire to bor----"<br>
<br>
"I said intention."<br>
<br>
"Pardon, so you did.  I thought it was an unheedful use of the word--an<br>
unheedful valuing of its strength, you know."<br>
<br>
"I knew its strength."<br>
<br>
"Well, I must say--but look here, let me walk the floor a little, my mind<br>
is getting into a sort of whirl, though you don't seem disturbed any.<br>
(Plainly this young fellow isn't crazy; but as to his being remarkable<br>
--well, really he amounts to that, and something over.)  Now then, I<br>
believe I am beyond the reach of further astonishment.  Strike, and spare<br>
not.  What is your scheme?"<br>
<br>
"To buy the wool crop--deliverable in sixty days."<br>
<br>
"What, the whole of it?"<br>
<br>
"The whole of it."<br>
<br>
"No, I was not quite out of the reach of surprises, after all.  Why, how<br>
you talk!  Do you know what our crop is going to foot up?"<br>
<br>
"Two and a half million sterling--maybe a little more."<br>
<br>
"Well, you've got your statistics right, any way.  Now, then, do you know<br>
what the margins would foot up, to buy it at sixty days?"<br>
<br>
"The hundred thousand pounds I came here to get."<br>
<br>
"Right, once more.  Well, dear me, just to see what would happen, I wish<br>
you had the money.  And if you had it, what would you do with it?"<br>
<br>
"I shall make two hundred thousand pounds out of it in sixty days."<br>
<br>
"You mean, of course, that you might make it if----"<br>
<br>
"I said 'shall'."<br>
<br>
"Yes, by George, you did say 'shall'!  You are the most definite devil I<br>
ever saw, in the matter of language.  Dear, dear, dear, look here!<br>
Definite speech means clarity of mind.  Upon my word I believe you've got<br>
what you believe to be a rational reason, for venturing into this house,<br>
an entire stranger, on this wild scheme of buying the wool crop of an<br>
entire colony on speculation.  Bring it out--I am prepared--acclimatized,<br>
if I may use the word.  Why would you buy the crop, and why would you<br>
make that sum out of it?  That is to say, what makes you think you----"<br>
<br>
"I don't think--I know."<br>
<br>
"Definite again.  How do you know?"<br>
<br>
"Because France has declared war against Germany, and wool has gone up<br>
fourteen per cent. in London and is still rising."<br>
<br>
"Oh, in-deed?  Now then, I've got you!  Such a thunderbolt as you have<br>
just let fly ought to have made me jump out of my chair, but it didn't<br>
stir me the least little bit, you see.  And for a very simple reason: I<br>
have read the morning paper.  You can look at it if you want to.  The<br>
fastest ship in the service arrived at eleven o'clock last night, fifty<br>
days out from London.  All her news is printed here.  There are no<br>
war-clouds anywhere; and as for wool, why, it is the low-spiritedest<br>
commodity in the English market.  It is your turn to jump, now .  .  .  .<br>
Well, why, don't you jump?  Why do you sit there in that placid fashion,<br>
when----"<br>
<br>
"Because I have later news."<br>
<br>
"Later news?  Oh, come--later news than fifty days, brought steaming hot<br>
from London by the----"<br>
<br>
"My news is only ten days old."<br>
<br>
"Oh, Mun-chausen, hear the maniac talk!  Where did you get it?"<br>
<br>
"Got it out of a shark."<br>
<br>
"Oh, oh, oh, this is too much!  Front!  call the police bring the gun<br>
--raise the town!  All the asylums in Christendom have broken loose in the<br>
single person of----"<br>
<br>
"Sit down!  And collect yourself.  Where is the use in getting excited?<br>
Am I excited?  There is nothing to get excited about.  When I make a<br>
statement which I cannot prove, it will be time enough for you to begin<br>
to offer hospitality to damaging fancies about me and my sanity."<br>
<br>
"Oh, a thousand, thousand pardons!  I ought to be ashamed of myself, and<br>
I am ashamed of myself for thinking that a little bit of a circumstance<br>
like sending a shark to England to fetch back a market report----"<br>
<br>
"What does your middle initial stand for, sir?"<br>
<br>
"Andrew.  What are you writing?"<br>
<br>
"Wait a moment.  Proof about the shark--and another matter.  Only ten<br>
lines.  There--now it is done.  Sign it."<br>
<br>
"Many thanks--many.  Let me see; it says--it says oh, come, this is<br>
interesting!  Why--why--look here!  prove what you say here, and I'll put<br>
up the money, and double as much, if necessary, and divide the winnings<br>
with you, half and half.  There, now--I've signed; make your promise good<br>
if you can.  Show me a copy of the London Times only ten days old."<br>
<br>
"Here it is--and with it these buttons and a memorandum book that<br>
belonged to the man the shark swallowed.  Swallowed him in the Thames,<br>
without a doubt; for you will notice that the last entry in the book is<br>
dated 'London,' and is of the same date as the Times, and says, 'Ber<br>
confequentz der Kreigeseflarun, reife ich heute nach Deutchland ab, aur<br>
bak ich mein leben auf dem Ultar meines Landes legen mag'----, as clean<br>
native German as anybody can put upon paper, and means that in<br>
consequence of the declaration of war, this loyal soul is leaving for<br>
home to-day, to fight.  And he did leave, too, but the shark had him<br>
before the day was done, poor fellow."<br>
<br>
"And a pity, too.  But there are times for mourning, and we will attend<br>
to this case further on; other matters are pressing, now.  I will go down<br>
and set the machinery in motion in a quiet way and buy the crop.  It will<br>
cheer the drooping spirits of the boys, in a transitory way.  Everything<br>
is transitory in this world.  Sixty days hence, when they are called to<br>
deliver the goods, they will think they've been struck by lightning.  But<br>
there is a time for mourning, and we will attend to that case along with<br>
the other one.  Come along, I'll take you to my tailor.  What did you say<br>
your name is?"<br>
<br>
"Cecil Rhodes."<br>
<br>
"It is hard to remember.  However, I think you will make it easier by and<br>
by, if you live.  There are three kinds of people--Commonplace Men,<br>
Remarkable Men, and Lunatics.  I'll classify you with the Remarkables,<br>
and take the chances."<br>
<br>
The deal went through, and secured to the young stranger the first<br>
fortune he ever pocketed.<br>
<br>
The people of Sydney ought to be afraid of the sharks, but for some<br>
reason they do not seem to be.  On Saturdays the young men go out in<br>
their boats, and sometimes the water is fairly covered with the little<br>
sails.  A boat upsets now and then, by accident, a result of tumultuous<br>
skylarking; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun--such as it is<br>
with sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence.  The<br>
young fellows scramble aboard whole--sometimes--not always.  Tragedies<br>
have happened more than once.  While I was in Sydney it was reported that<br>
a boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the Paramatta river and screamed<br>
for help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him from<br>
the assembling sharks; but the sharks made swift work with the lives of<br>
both.<br>
<br>
The government pays a bounty for the shark; to get the bounty the<br>
fishermen bait the hook or the seine with agreeable mutton; the news<br>
spreads and the sharks come from all over the Pacific Ocean to get the<br>
free board.  In time the shark culture will be one of the most successful<br>
things in the colony.<br>

CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<br>
We can secure other people's approval, if we do right and try hard; but<br>
our own is worth a hundred of it, and no way has been found out of<br>
securing that.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
My health had broken down in New York in May; it had remained in a<br>
doubtful but fairish condition during a succeeding period of 82 days; it<br>
broke again on the Pacific.  It broke again in Sydney, but not until<br>
after I had had a good outing, and had also filled my lecture<br>
engagements.  This latest break lost me the chance of seeing Queensland.<br>
In the circumstances, to go north toward hotter weather was not<br>
advisable.<br>
<br>
So we moved south with a westward slant, 17 hours by rail to the capital<br>
of the colony of Victoria, Melbourne--that juvenile city of sixty years,<br>
and half a million inhabitants.  On the map the distance looked small;<br>
but that is a trouble with all divisions of distance in such a vast<br>
country as Australia.  The colony of Victoria itself looks small on the<br>
map--looks like a county, in fact--yet it is about as large as England,<br>
Scotland, and Wales combined.  Or, to get another focus upon it, it is<br>
just 80 times as large as the state of Rhode Island, and one-third as<br>
large as the State of Texas.<br>
<br>
Outside of Melbourne, Victoria seems to be owned by a handful of<br>
squatters, each with a Rhode Island for a sheep farm.  That is the<br>
impression which one gathers from common talk, yet the wool industry of<br>
Victoria is by no means so great as that of New South Wales.  The climate<br>
of Victoria is favorable to other great industries--among others,<br>
wheat-growing and the making of wine.<br>
<br>
We took the train at Sydney at about four in the afternoon.  It was<br>
American in one way, for we had a most rational sleeping car; also the<br>
car was clean and fine and new--nothing about it to suggest the rolling<br>
stock of the continent of Europe.  But our baggage was weighed, and extra<br>
weight charged for.  That was continental.  Continental and troublesome.<br>
Any detail of railroading that is not troublesome cannot honorably be<br>
described as continental.<br>
<br>
The tickets were round-trip ones--to Melbourne, and clear to Adelaide in<br>
South Australia, and then all the way back to Sydney.  Twelve hundred<br>
more miles than we really expected to make; but then as the round trip<br>
wouldn't cost much more than the single trip, it seemed well enough to<br>
buy as many miles as one could afford, even if one was not likely to need<br>
them.  A human being has a natural desire to have more of a good thing<br>
than he needs.<br>
<br>
Now comes a singular thing: the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the<br>
most baffling and unaccountable marvel that Australasia can show.  At the<br>
frontier between New South Wales and Victoria our multitude of passengers<br>
were routed out of their snug beds by lantern-light in the morning in the<br>
biting-cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road that has no break<br>
in it from Sydney to Melbourne!  Think of the paralysis of intellect that<br>
gave that idea birth; imagine the boulder it emerged from on some<br>
petrified legislator's shoulders.<br>
<br>
It is a narrow-gage road to the frontier, and a broader gauge thence to<br>
Melbourne.  The two governments were the builders of the road and are the<br>
owners of it.  One or two reasons are given for this curious state of<br>
things.  One is, that it represents the jealousy existing between the<br>
colonies--the two most important colonies of Australasia.  What the other<br>
one is, I have forgotten.  But it is of no consequence.  It could be but<br>
another effort to explain the inexplicable.<br>
<br>
All passengers fret at the double-gauge; all shippers of freight must of<br>
course fret at it; unnecessary expense, delay, and annoyance are imposed<br>
upon everybody concerned, and no one is benefitted.<br>
<br>
Each Australian colony fences itself off from its neighbor with a<br>
custom-house.  Personally, I have no objection, but it must be a good<br>
deal of inconvenience to the people.  We have something resembling it<br>
here and there in America, but it goes by another name.  The large empire<br>
of the Pacific coast requires a world of iron machinery, and could<br>
manufacture it economically on the spot if the imposts on foreign iron<br>
were removed. But they are not.  Protection to Pennsylvania and Alabama<br>
forbids it. The result to the Pacific coast is the same as if there were<br>
several rows of custom-fences between the coast and the East.  Iron<br>
carted across the American continent at luxurious railway rates would be<br>
valuable enough to be coined when it arrived.<br>
<br>
We changed cars.  This was at Albury.  And it was there, I think, that<br>
the growing day and the early sun exposed the distant range called the<br>
Blue Mountains.  Accurately named.  "My word!" as the Australians say,<br>
but it was a stunning color, that blue.  Deep, strong, rich, exquisite;<br>
towering and majestic masses of blue--a softly luminous blue, a<br>
smouldering blue, as if vaguely lit by fires within.  It extinguished the<br>
blue of the sky--made it pallid and unwholesome, whitey and washed-out.<br>
A wonderful color--just divine.<br>
<br>
A resident told me that those were not mountains; he said they were<br>
rabbit-piles.  And explained that long exposure and the over-ripe<br>
condition of the rabbits was what made them look so blue.  This man may<br>
have been right, but much reading of books of travel has made me<br>
distrustful of gratis information furnished by unofficial residents of a<br>
country.  The facts which such people give to travelers are usually<br>
erroneous, and often intemperately so.  The rabbit-plague has indeed been<br>
very bad in Australia, and it could account for one mountain, but not for<br>
a mountain range, it seems to me.  It is too large an order.<br>
<br>
We breakfasted at the station.  A good breakfast, except the coffee; and<br>
cheap.  The Government establishes the prices and placards them.  The<br>
waiters were men, I think; but that is not usual in Australasia.  The<br>
usual thing is to have girls.  No, not girls, young ladies--generally<br>
duchesses.  Dress?  They would attract attention at any royal levee in<br>
Europe.  Even empresses and queens do not dress as they do.  Not that<br>
they could not afford it, perhaps, but they would not know how.<br>
<br>
All the pleasant morning we slid smoothly along over the plains, through<br>
thin--not thick--forests of great melancholy gum trees, with trunks<br>
rugged with curled sheets of flaking bark--erysipelas convalescents, so<br>
to speak, shedding their dead skins.  And all along were tiny cabins,<br>
built sometimes of wood, sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron; and<br>
the doorsteps and fences were clogged with children--rugged little<br>
simply-clad chaps that looked as if they had been imported from the<br>
banks of the Mississippi without breaking bulk.<br>
<br>
And there were little villages, with neat stations well placarded with<br>
showy advertisements--mainly of almost too self-righteous brands of<br>
"sheepdip."  If that is the name--and I think it is.  It is a stuff like<br>
tar, and is dabbed on to places where the shearer clips a piece out of<br>
the sheep.  It bars out the flies, and has healing properties, and a nip<br>
to it which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills.  It<br>
is not good to eat.  That is, it is not good to eat except when mixed<br>
with railroad coffee.  It improves railroad coffee.  Without it railroad<br>
coffee is too vague.  But with it, it is quite assertive and<br>
enthusiastic.  By itself, railroad coffee is too passive; but sheep-dip<br>
makes it wake up and get down to business.  I wonder where they get<br>
railroad coffee?<br>
<br>
We saw birds, but not a kangaroo, not an emu, not an ornithorhynchus, not<br>
a lecturer, not a native.  Indeed, the land seemed quite destitute of<br>
game.  But I have misused the word native.  In Australia it is applied to<br>
Australian-born whites only.  I should have said that we saw no<br>
Aboriginals--no "blackfellows."  And to this day I have never seen one.<br>
In the great museums you will find all the other curiosities, but in the<br>
curio of chiefest interest to the stranger all of them are lacking.  We<br>
have at home an abundance of museums, and not an American Indian in them.<br>
It is clearly an absurdity, but it never struck me before.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XV.<br>
<br>
Truth is stranger than fiction--to some people, but I am measurably<br>
familiar with it.<br>
                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to<br>
stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.<br>
                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
The air was balmy and delicious, the sunshine radiant; it was a charming<br>
excursion.  In the course of it we came to a town whose odd name was<br>
famous all over the world a quarter of a century ago--Wagga-Wagga.  This<br>
was because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop there.  It was<br>
out of the midst of his humble collection of sausages and tripe that he<br>
soared up into the zenith of notoriety and hung there in the wastes of<br>
space a time, with the telescopes of all nations leveled at him in<br>
unappeasable curiosity--curiosity as to which of the two long-missing<br>
persons he was:  Arthur Orton, the mislaid roustabout of Wapping, or Sir<br>
Roger Tichborne, the lost heir of a name and estates as old as English<br>
history.  We all know now, but not a dozen people knew then; and the<br>
dozen kept the mystery to themselves and allowed the most intricate and<br>
fascinating and marvelous real-life romance that has ever been played<br>
upon the world's stage to unfold itself serenely, act by act, in a<br>
British court by the long and laborious processes of judicial<br>
development.<br>
<br>
When we recall the details of that great romance we marvel to see what<br>
daring chances truth may freely take in constructing a tale, as compared<br>
with the poor little conservative risks permitted to fiction.  The<br>
fiction-artist could achieve no success with the materials of this<br>
splendid Tichborne romance.<br>
<br>
He would have to drop out the chief characters; the public would say such<br>
people are impossible.  He would have to drop out a number of the most<br>
picturesque incidents; the public would say such things could never<br>
happen.  And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents did<br>
happen.<br>
<br>
It cost the Tichborne estates $400,000 to unmask the Claimant and drive<br>
him out; and even after the exposure multitudes of Englishmen still<br>
believed in him.  It cost the British Government another $400,000 to<br>
convict him of perjury; and after the conviction the same old multitudes<br>
still believed in him; and among these believers were many educated and<br>
intelligent men; and some of them had personally known the real Sir<br>
Roger.  The Claimant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment.  When he<br>
got out of prison he went to New York and kept a whisky saloon in the<br>
Bowery for a time, then disappeared from view.<br>
<br>
He always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death called for him.<br>
This was but a few months ago--not very much short of a generation since<br>
he left Wagga-Wagga to go and possess himself of his estates.  On his<br>
death-bed he yielded up his secret, and confessed in writing that he was<br>
only Arthur Orton of Wapping, able seaman and butcher--that and nothing<br>
more.  But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are people whom even<br>
his dying confession will not convince.  The old habit of assimilating<br>
incredibilities must have made strong food a necessity in their case; a<br>
weaker article would probably disagree with them.<br>
<br>
I was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for perjury.  I<br>
attended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous quarters provided for<br>
him from the purses of his adherents and well-wishers.  He was in evening<br>
dress, and I thought him a rather fine and stately creature.  There were<br>
about twenty-five gentlemen present; educated men, men moving in good<br>
society, none of them commonplace; some of them were men of distinction,<br>
none of them were obscurities.  They were his cordial friends and<br>
admirers.  It was "Sir Roger," always "Sir Roger," on all hands; no one<br>
withheld the title, all turned it from the tongue with unction, and as if<br>
it tasted good.<br>
<br>
For many years I had had a mystery in stock.  Melbourne, and only<br>
Melbourne, could unriddle it for me.  In 1873 I arrived in London with my<br>
wife and young child, and presently received a note from Naples signed by<br>
a name not familiar to me.  It was not Bascom, and it was not Henry; but<br>
I will call it Henry Bascom for convenience's sake.  This note, of about<br>
six lines, was written on a strip of white paper whose end-edges were<br>
ragged.  I came to be familiar with those strips in later years.  Their<br>
size and pattern were always the same.  Their contents were usually to<br>
the same effect: would I and mine come to the writer's country-place in<br>
England on such and such a date, by such and such a train, and stay<br>
twelve days and depart by such and such a train at the end of the<br>
specified time?  A carriage would meet us at the station.<br>
<br>
These invitations were always for a long time ahead; if we were in<br>
Europe, three months ahead; if we were in America, six to twelve months<br>
ahead.  They always named the exact date and train for the beginning and<br>
also for the end of the visit.<br>
<br>
This first note invited us for a date three months in the future.  It<br>
asked us to arrive by the 4.10 p.m. train from London, August 6th.  The<br>
carriage would be waiting.  The carriage would take us away seven days<br>
later-train specified.  And there were these words: "Speak to Tom<br>
Hughes."<br>
<br>
I showed the note to the author of "Tom Brown at Rugby," and be said:<br>
"Accept, and be thankful."<br>
<br>
He described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius, a man of fine<br>
attainments, a choice man in every way, a rare and beautiful character.<br>
He said that Bascom Hall was a particularly fine example of the stately<br>
manorial mansion of Elizabeth's days, and that it was a house worth going<br>
a long way to see--like Knowle; that Mr. B. was of a social disposition;<br>
liked the company of agreeable people, and always had samples of the sort<br>
coming and going.<br>
<br>
We paid the visit.  We paid others, in later years--the last one in 1879.<br>
Soon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage around the world in a<br>
steam yacht--a long and leisurely trip, for he was making collections, in<br>
all lands, of birds, butterflies, and such things.<br>
<br>
The day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin Guiteau, we were<br>
at a little watering place on Long Island Sound; and in the mail matter<br>
of that day came a letter with the Melbourne post-mark on it.  It was for<br>
my wife, but I recognized Mr. Bascom's handwriting on the envelope, and<br>
opened it.  It was the usual note--as to paucity of lines--and was<br>
written on the customary strip of paper; but there was nothing usual<br>
about the contents.  The note informed my wife that if it would be any<br>
assuagement of her grief to know that her husband's lecture-tour in<br>
Australia was a satisfactory venture from the beginning to the end, he,<br>
the writer, could testify that such was the case; also, that her<br>
husband's untimely death had been mourned by all classes, as she would<br>
already know by the press telegrams, long before the reception of this<br>
note; that the funeral was attended by the officials of the colonial and<br>
city governments; and that while he, the writer, her friend and mine, had<br>
not reached Melbourne in time to see the body, he had at least had the<br>
sad privilege of acting as one of the pall-bearers.  Signed, "Henry<br>
Bascom."<br>
<br>
My first thought was, why didn't he have the coffin opened?  He would<br>
have seen that the corpse was an imposter, and he could have gone right<br>
ahead and dried up the most of those tears, and comforted those sorrowing<br>
governments, and sold the remains and sent me the money.<br>
<br>
I did nothing about the matter.  I had set the law after living lecture<br>
doubles of mine a couple of times in America, and the law had not been<br>
able to catch them; others in my trade had tried to catch their<br>
impostor-doubles and had failed.  Then where was the use in harrying a<br>
ghost? None--and so I did not disturb it.  I had a curiosity to know<br>
about that man's lecture-tour and last moments, but that could wait.<br>
When I should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it.  But he<br>
passed from life, and I never saw him again..  My curiosity faded away.<br>
<br>
However, when I found that I was going to Australia it revived.  And<br>
naturally: for if the people should say that I was a dull, poor thing<br>
compared to what I was before I died, it would have a bad effect on<br>
business.  Well, to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard of<br>
that impostor!  I pressed them, but they were firm--they had never heard<br>
of him, and didn't believe in him.<br>
<br>
I could not understand it; still, I thought it would all come right in<br>
Melbourne.  The government would remember; and the other mourners.  At<br>
the supper of the Institute of Journalists I should find out all about<br>
the matter.  But no--it turned out that they had never heard of it.<br>
<br>
So my mystery was a mystery still.  It was a great disappointment.  I<br>
believed it would never be cleared up--in this life--so I dropped it out<br>
of my mind.<br>
<br>
But at last! just when I was least expecting it----<br>
<br>
However, this is not the place for the rest of it; I shall come to the<br>
matter again, in a far-distant chapter.<br>
<br>

CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<br>
There is a Moral sense, and there is an Immoral Sense.  History shows us<br>
that the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid it,<br>
and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how to<br>
enjoy it.<br>
                              -Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
Melbourne spreads around over an immense area of ground.  It is a stately<br>
city architecturally as well as in magnitude.  It has an elaborate system<br>
of cable-car service; it has museums, and colleges, and schools, and<br>
public gardens, and electricity, and gas, and libraries, and theaters,<br>
and mining centers, and wool centers, and centers of the arts and<br>
sciences, and boards of trade, and ships, and railroads, and a harbor,<br>
and social clubs, and journalistic clubs, and racing clubs, and a<br>
squatter club sumptuously housed and appointed, and as many churches and<br>
banks as can make a living.  In a word, it is equipped with everything<br>
that goes to make the modern great city.  It is the largest city of<br>
Australasia, and fills the post with honor and credit.  It has one<br>
specialty; this must not be jumbled in with those other things.  It is<br>
the mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult.  Its race-ground is the<br>
Mecca of Australasia.  On the great annual day of sacrifice--the 5th of<br>
November, Guy Fawkes's Day--business is suspended over a stretch of land<br>
and sea as wide as from New York to San Francisco, and deeper than from<br>
the northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and every man and woman, of<br>
high degree or low, who can afford the expense, put away their other<br>
duties and come.  They begin to swarm in by ship and rail a fortnight<br>
before the day, and they swarm thicker and thicker day after day, until<br>
all the vehicles of transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meet<br>
the demands of the occasion, and all hotels and lodgings are bulging<br>
outward because of the pressure from within.  They come a hundred<br>
thousand strong, as all the best authorities say, and they pack the<br>
spacious grounds and grandstands and make a spectacle such as is never to<br>
be seen in Australasia elsewhere.<br>
<br>
It is the "Melbourne Cup" that brings this multitude together.  Their<br>
clothes have been ordered long ago, at unlimited cost, and without bounds<br>
as to beauty and magnificence, and have been kept in concealment until<br>
now, for unto this day are they consecrate.  I am speaking of the ladies'<br>
clothes; but one might know that.<br>
<br>
And so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, a<br>
delirium of color, a vision of beauty.  The champagne flows, everybody is<br>
vivacious, excited, happy; everybody bets, and gloves and fortunes change<br>
hands right along, all the time.  Day after day the races go on, and the<br>
fun and the excitement are kept at white heat; and when each day is done,<br>
the people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race in the morning.<br>
And at the end of the great week the swarms secure lodgings and<br>
transportation for next year, then flock away to their remote homes and<br>
count their gains and losses, and order next year's Cup-clothes, and then<br>
lie down and sleep two weeks, and get up sorry to reflect that a whole<br>
year must be put in somehow or other before they can be wholly happy<br>
again.<br>
<br>
The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day.  It would be<br>
difficult to overstate its importance.  It overshadows all other holidays<br>
and specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies.<br>
Overshadows them?  I might almost say it blots them out.  Each of them<br>
gets attention, but not everybody's; each of them evokes interest, but<br>
not everybody's; each of them rouses enthusiasm, but not everybody's; in<br>
each case a part of the attention, interest, and enthusiasm is a matter<br>
of habit and custom, and another part of it is official and perfunctory.<br>
Cup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an attention, an interest, and an<br>
enthusiasm which are universal--and spontaneous, not perfunctory.  Cup<br>
Day is supreme it has no rival.  I can call to mind no specialized annual<br>
day, in any country, which can be named by that large name--Supreme.  I<br>
can call to mind no specialized annual day, in any country, whose<br>
approach fires the whole land with a conflagration of conversation and<br>
preparation and anticipation and jubilation.  No day save this one; but<br>
this one does it.<br>
<br>
In America we have no annual supreme day; no day whose approach makes the<br>
whole nation glad.  We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, and<br>
Thanksgiving.  Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them can<br>
arouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal.  Eight grown<br>
Americans out of ten dread the coming of the Fourth, with its pandemonium<br>
and its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone--if still alive.  The<br>
approach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellent<br>
people.  They have to buy a cart-load of presents, and they never know<br>
what to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hard<br>
and anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are so<br>
dissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they want to sit<br>
down and cry.  Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once a<br>
year.  The observance of Thanksgiving Day--as a function--has become<br>
general of late years.  The Thankfulness is not so general.  This is<br>
natural.  Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard<br>
time during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their<br>
enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
We have a supreme day--a sweeping and tremendous and tumultuous day, a<br>
day which commands an absolute universality of interest and excitement;<br>
but it is not annual.  It comes but once in four years; therefore it<br>
cannot count as a rival of the Melbourne Cup.<br>
<br>
In Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days--Christmas and the<br>
Queen's birthday.  But they are equally popular; there is no supremacy.<br>
<br>
I think it must be conceded that the position of the Australasian Day is<br>
unique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to hold that high place a long<br>
time.<br>
<br>
The next things which interest us when we travel are, first, the people;<br>
next, the novelties; and finally the history of the places and countries<br>
visited.  Novelties are rare in cities which represent the most advanced<br>
civilization of the modern day.  When one is familiar with such cities in<br>
the other parts of the world he is in effect familiar with the cities of<br>
Australasia.  The outside aspects will furnish little that is new.  There<br>
will be new names, but the things which they represent will sometimes be<br>
found to be less new than their names.  There may be shades of<br>
difference, but these can easily be too fine for detection by the<br>
incompetent eye of the passing stranger.  In the larrikin he will not be<br>
able to discover a new species, but only an old one met elsewhere, and<br>
variously called loafer, rough, tough, bummer, or blatherskite, according<br>
to his geographical distribution.  The larrikin differs by a shade from<br>
those others, in that he is more sociable toward the stranger than they,<br>
more kindly disposed, more hospitable, more hearty, more friendly.  At<br>
least it seemed so to me, and I had opportunity to observe.  In Sydney,<br>
at least.  In Melbourne I had to drive to and from the lecture-theater,<br>
but in Sydney I was able to walk both ways, and did it.  Every night, on<br>
my way home at ten, or a quarter past, I found the larrikin grouped in<br>
considerable force at several of the street corners, and he always gave<br>
me this pleasant salutation:<br>
<br>
"Hello, Mark!"<br>
<br>
"Here's to you, old chap!<br>
<br>
"Say--Mark!--is he dead?"--a reference to a passage in some book of mine,<br>
though I did not detect, at that time, that that was its source.  And I<br>
didn't detect it afterward in Melbourne, when I came on the stage for the<br>
first time, and the same question was dropped down upon me from the dizzy<br>
height of the gallery.  It is always difficult to answer a sudden inquiry<br>
like that, when you have come unprepared and don't know what it means.<br>
I will remark here--if it is not an indecorum--that the welcome which an<br>
American lecturer gets from a British colonial audience is a thing which<br>
will move him to his deepest deeps, and veil his sight and break his<br>
voice.  And from Winnipeg to Africa, experience will teach him nothing;<br>
he will never learn to expect it, it will catch him as a surprise each<br>
time.  The war-cloud hanging black over England and America made no<br>
trouble for me.  I was a prospective prisoner of war, but at dinners,<br>
suppers, on the platform, and elsewhere, there was never anything to<br>
remind me of it.  This was hospitality of the right metal, and would have<br>
been prominently lacking in some countries, in the circumstances.<br>
<br>
And speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring to light the<br>
unexpected, in a detail or two.  It seemed to relegate the war-talk to<br>
the politicians on both sides of the water; whereas whenever a<br>
prospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore, the<br>
public had done most of the talking and the bitterest.  The attitude of<br>
the newspapers was new also.  I speak of those of Australasia and India,<br>
for I had access to those only.  They treated the subject argumentatively<br>
and with dignity, not with spite and anger.  That was a new spirit, too,<br>
and not learned of the French and German press, either before Sedan or<br>
since.  I heard many public speeches, and they reflected the moderation<br>
of the journals.  The outlook is that the English-speaking race will<br>
dominate the earth a hundred years from now, if its sections do not get<br>
to fighting each other.  It would be a pity to spoil that prospect by<br>
baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle their<br>
differences so much better and also so much more definitely.<br>
<br>
No, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great capitals of<br>
modern times.  Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from<br>
the familiar stock exchange of other countries.  Wool brokers are just<br>
like stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up their<br>
hands and yell in unison--no stranger can tell what--and the president<br>
calmly says "Sold to Smith & Co., threpence farthing--next!"--when<br>
probably nothing of the kind happened; for how should he know?<br>
<br>
In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and fascinating<br>
things; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire your eyes,<br>
and break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their consuming<br>
interest.  You always say you will never go again, but you do go.  The<br>
palaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the rich<br>
in America, and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblance<br>
ends.  The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large,<br>
and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the grounds are often<br>
ducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners together make them as<br>
beautiful as a dream.  It is said that some of the country seats have<br>
grounds--domains--about them which rival in charm and magnitude those<br>
which surround the country mansion of an English lord; but I was not out<br>
in the country; I had my hands full in town.<br>
<br>
And what was the origin of this majestic city and its efflorescence of<br>
palatial town houses and country seats?  Its first brick was laid and<br>
its first house built by a passing convict.  Australian history is almost<br>
always picturesque; indeed, it is so curious and strange, that it is<br>
itself the chiefest novelty the country has to offer, and so it pushes<br>
the other novelties into second and third place.  It does not read like<br>
history, but like the most beautiful lies.  And all of a fresh new sort,<br>
no mouldy old stale ones.  It is full of surprises, and adventures, and<br>
incongruities, and contradictions, and incredibilities; but they are all<br>
true, they all happened.<br>

CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<br>
The English are mentioned in the Bible: Blessed are the meek, for they<br>
shall inherit the earth.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
When we consider the immensity of the British Empire in territory,<br>
population, and trade, it requires a stern exercise of faith to believe<br>
in the figures which represent Australasia's contribution to the Empire's<br>
commercial grandeur.  As compared with the landed estate of the British<br>
Empire, the landed estate dominated by any other Power except one<br>
--Russia--is not very impressive for size.  My authorities make the British<br>
Empire not much short of a fourth larger than the Russian Empire.<br>
Roughly proportioned, if you will allow your entire hand to represent the<br>
British Empire, you may then cut off the fingers a trifle above the<br>
middle joint of the middle finger, and what is left of the hand will<br>
represent Russia.  The populations ruled by Great Britain and China are<br>
about the same--400,000,000 each.  No other Power approaches these<br>
figures.  Even Russia is left far behind.<br>
<br>
The population of Australasia--4,000,000--sinks into nothingness, and is<br>
lost from sight in that British ocean of 400,000,000.  Yet the statistics<br>
indicate that it rises again and shows up very conspicuously when its<br>
share of the Empire's commerce is the matter under consideration.  The<br>
value of England's annual exports and imports is stated at three billions<br>
of dollars,--[New South Wales Blue Book.]--and it is claimed that more<br>
than one-tenth of this great aggregate is represented by Australasia's<br>
exports to England and imports from England.  In addition to this,<br>
Australasia does a trade with countries other than England, amounting to<br>
a hundred million dollars a year, and a domestic intercolonial trade<br>
amounting to a hundred and fifty millions.<br>
<br>
In round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about $600,000,000 worth of<br>
goods a year.  It is claimed that about half of this represents<br>
commodities of Australasian production.  The products exported annually<br>
by India are worth a trifle over $500,000,000.  Now, here are some<br>
faith-straining figures:<br>
<br>
Indian production (300,000,000 population), $500,000,000.<br>
<br>
Australasian production (4,000,000 population), $300,000,000.<br>
<br>
That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (for<br>
export some whither), is worth $1.15; that of the individual<br>
Australasian (for export some whither), $75! Or, to put it in another<br>
way, the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away an<br>
annual result worth $8.75, while the Australasian family sends away $375<br>
worth.<br>
<br>
There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and<br>
others, which show that the individual Indian's whole annual product,<br>
both for export and home use, is worth in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50<br>
for the family-aggregate.  Ciphered out on a like ratio of<br>
multiplication, the Australasian family's aggregate production would be<br>
nearly $1,600.  Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once<br>
get started.<br>
<br>
We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast Province<br>
of South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion.  On the train we found<br>
several Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit,<br>
and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver<br>
mine is.  It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region.  Broken<br>
Hill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is on<br>
the eastern border.  A fairly straight line, 700 miles long, drawn<br>
westward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhat<br>
shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo.  The way the<br>
Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said;<br>
southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide,<br>
then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales<br>
once more--to Broken Hill.  It was like going from Boston southwest to<br>
Richmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant<br>
back northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York.<br>
<br>
But the explanation was simple.  Years ago the fabulously rich silver<br>
discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world.  Its<br>
stocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the most<br>
fanciful figures.  It was one of those cases where the cook puts a<br>
month's wages into shares, and comes next mouth and buys your house at<br>
your own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a few<br>
shares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailor<br>
invests the price of a spree, and next month buys out the steamship<br>
company and goes into business on his own hook.  In a word, it was one of<br>
those excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center<br>
with a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once.  Adelaide was<br>
close by, Sydney was far away.  Adelaide threw a short railway across the<br>
border before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not worth<br>
while for Sydney to arrange at all.  The whole vast trade-profit of<br>
Broken Hill fell into Adelaide's hands, irrevocably.  New South Wales<br>
furnishes for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles--mainly<br>
through alien countries--to administer it, but Adelaide takes the<br>
dividends and makes no moan.<br>
<br>
We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level until night.<br>
In the morning we had a stretch of "scrub" country--the kind of thing<br>
which is so useful to the Australian novelist.  In the scrub the hostile<br>
aboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time to<br>
time to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, and<br>
leaving no track that the white man can follow.  In the scrub the<br>
novelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she wanders here<br>
and there, and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious, and the<br>
searchers pass within a yard or two of her, not suspecting that she is<br>
near, and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary<br>
which she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind.  Nobody<br>
can find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal "tracker," and he<br>
will not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with the<br>
novelist's plot.  The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions,<br>
and looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it<br>
--as seamless as a blanket, to all appearance.  One might as well walk<br>
under water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it, I should<br>
think.  Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal "tracker" was able to hunt<br>
out people lost in the scrub.  Also in the "bush"; also in the desert;<br>
and even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial ground<br>
which had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints.<br>
<br>
From reading Australian books and talking with the people, I became<br>
convinced that the aboriginal tracker's performances evince a craft, a<br>
penetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy of<br>
observation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so<br>
remarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored.  In an<br>
official account of the blacks of Australia published by the government<br>
of Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint<br>
marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, but<br>
knows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or<br>
yesterday.<br>
<br>
And there is the case, on records where A., a settler, makes a bet with<br>
B., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will produce<br>
an aboriginal who will find her.  B. selects a cow and lets the tracker<br>
see the cow's footprint, then be put under guard.  B. then drives the cow<br>
a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequently<br>
doubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time,<br>
and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows, and<br>
mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs.  He finally brings<br>
his cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves around<br>
in a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is<br>
after; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, and<br>
ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow.  Now<br>
wherein does one cow-track differ from another?  There must be a<br>
difference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; a<br>
difference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by the<br>
late Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race charged<br>
by some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of human<br>
intelligence.<br>

CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
<br>
It is easier to stay out than get out.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
The train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, and went twisting<br>
in and out through lovely little green valleys.  There were several<br>
varieties of gum trees; among them many giants.  Some of them were bodied<br>
and barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, and reminded<br>
one of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures.  And there was one<br>
peculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know.  The<br>
foliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines, the lower half<br>
of each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vivid<br>
and strenuous and shouting green.  The effect was altogether bewitching.<br>
The tree was apparently rare.  I should say that the first and last<br>
samples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart.  There<br>
was another tree of striking aspect, a kind of pine, we were told.  Its<br>
foliage was as fine as hair, apparently, and its mass sphered itself<br>
above the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke.  It was<br>
not a sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but each<br>
individual stood far away from its nearest neighbor.  It scattered itself<br>
in this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swelling<br>
grassy great knolls, and stood in the full flood of the wonderful<br>
sunshine; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also see<br>
the ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet.<br>
<br>
On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom--importations<br>
from England--and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visit<br>
tried to tell me which--was which; but as he didn't know, he had<br>
difficulty.  He said he was ashamed of his ignorance, but that he had<br>
never been confronted with the question before during the fifty years and<br>
more that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never happened to get<br>
interested in the matter.  But there was no need to be ashamed.  The most<br>
of us have his defect.  We take a natural interest in novelties, but it<br>
is against nature to take an interest in familiar things.  The gorse and<br>
the broom were a fine accent in the landscape.  Here and there they burst<br>
out in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background of<br>
sober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a body catch<br>
his breath with the happy surprise of it.  And then there was the wattle,<br>
a native bush or tree, an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom.  It<br>
is a favorite with the Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a quality<br>
usually wanting in Australian blossoms.<br>
<br>
The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his formation about the<br>
gorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth of<br>
twenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-six<br>
shillings in his pocket--an adventurer without trade, profession, or<br>
friends, but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head: he would stay<br>
until he was worth L200, then go back home.  He would allow himself five<br>
years for the accumulation of this fortune.<br>
<br>
"That was more than fifty years ago," said he.  "And here I am, yet."<br>
<br>
As he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and introduced him<br>
to me, and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke.  I spoke of the<br>
previous conversation and said there something very pathetic about this<br>
half century of exile, and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded.<br>
<br>
"With him?  Oh, it did.  It's not so sad a case.  He is modest, and he<br>
left out some of the particulars.  The lad reached South Australia just<br>
in time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines.  They turned out<br>
L700,000 in the first three years.  Up to now they have yielded<br>
L120,000,000.  He has had his share.  Before that boy had been in the<br>
country two years he could have gone home and bought a village; he could<br>
go now and buy a city, I think.  No, there is nothing very pathetic about<br>
his case.  He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save South<br>
Australia.  It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a land<br>
boom a while before."  There it is again; picturesque history<br>
--Australia's specialty.  In 1829 South Australia hadn't a white man in it.<br>
In 1836 the British Parliament erected it--still a solitude--into a<br>
Province, and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery.<br>
Speculators took hold, now, and inaugurated a vast land scheme, and<br>
invited immigration, encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth.<br>
It was well worked in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all ports of<br>
people made a rush for the land company's shares.  Immigrants soon began<br>
to pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in the<br>
sand and the mangrove swamps by the sea.  The crowds continued to come,<br>
prices of land rose high, then higher and still higher, everybody was<br>
prosperous and happy, the boom swelled into gigantic proportions.  A<br>
village of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, and<br>
in these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed ladies played on<br>
costly pianos, London swells in evening dress and patent-leather boots<br>
were abundant, and this fine society drank champagne, and in other ways<br>
conducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had been<br>
accustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of the<br>
world.  The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its own<br>
use, and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor.  The governor<br>
had a guard, and maintained a court.  Roads, wharves, and hospitals were<br>
built.  All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on inflated and fictitious<br>
values--on the boom's moonshine, in fact.  This went on handsomely during<br>
four or five years.  Then of a sudden came a smash.  Bills for a huge<br>
amount drawn the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, the land<br>
company's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values fell with a<br>
rush, the frightened immigrants seized their grips and fled to other<br>
lands, leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude, where lately<br>
had been a buzzing and populous hive of men.<br>
<br>
Adelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had fallen to 3,000.<br>
During two years or more the death-trance continued.  Prospect of revival<br>
there was none; hope of it ceased.  Then, as suddenly as the paralysis<br>
had come, came the resurrection from it.  Those astonishingly rich copper<br>
mines were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced.<br>
<br>
The wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed--followed so<br>
vigorously, too, that four or five years after the copper discovery, this<br>
little colony, which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly, and pay<br>
hard prices for them--once $50 a barrel for flour--had become an exporter<br>
of grain.<br>
<br>
The prosperities continued.  After many years Providence, desiring to<br>
show especial regard for New South Wales and exhibit loving interest in<br>
its welfare which should certify to all nations the recognition of that<br>
colony's conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving,<br>
conferred upon it that treasury of inconceivable riches, Broken Hill; and<br>
South Australia went over the border and took it, giving thanks.<br>
<br>
Among our passengers was an American with a unique vocation.  Unique is a<br>
strong word, but I use it justifiably if I did not misconceive what the<br>
American told me; for I understood him to say that in the world there was<br>
not another man engaged in the business which he was following.  He was<br>
buying the kangaroo-skin crop; buying all of it, both the Australian crop<br>
and the Tasmanian; and buying it for an American house in New York.  The<br>
prices were not high, as there was no competition, but the year's<br>
aggregate of skins would cost him L30,000.  I had had the idea that the<br>
kangaroo was about extinct in Tasmania and well thinned out on the<br>
continent.  In America the skins are tanned and made into shoes.  After<br>
the tanning, the leather takes a new name--which I have forgotten--I only<br>
remember that the new name does not indicate that the kangaroo furnishes<br>
the leather.  There was a German competition for a while, some years ago,<br>
but that has ceased.  The Germans failed to arrive at the secret of<br>
tanning the skins successfully, and they withdrew from the business.  Now<br>
then, I suppose that I have seen a man whose occupation is really<br>
entitled to bear that high epithet--unique.  And I suppose that there is<br>
not another occupation in the world that is restricted to the hands of a<br>
sole person.  I can think of no instance of it.  There is more than one<br>
Pope, there is more than one Emperor, there is even more than one living<br>
god, walking upon the earth and worshiped in all sincerity by large<br>
populations of men.  I have seen and talked with two of these Beings<br>
myself in India, and I have the autograph of one of them.  It can come<br>
good, by and by, I reckon, if I attach it to a "permit."<br>
<br>
Approaching Adelaide we dismounted from the train, as the French say, and<br>
were driven in an open carriage over the hills and along their slopes to<br>
the city.  It was an excursion of an hour or two, and the charm of it<br>
could not be overstated, I think.  The road wound around gaps and gorges,<br>
and offered all varieties of scenery and prospect--mountains, crags,<br>
country homes, gardens, forests--color, color, color everywhere, and the<br>
air fine and fresh, the skies blue, and not a shred of cloud to mar the<br>
downpour of the brilliant sunshine.  And finally the mountain gateway<br>
opened, and the immense plain lay spread out below and stretching away<br>
into dim distances on every hand, soft and delicate and dainty and<br>
beautiful.  On its near edge reposed the city.<br>
<br>
We descended and entered.  There was nothing to remind one of the humble<br>
capital, of buts and sheds of the long-vanished day of the land-boom.<br>
No, this was a modern city, with wide streets, compactly built; with fine<br>
homes everywhere, embowered in foliage and flowers, and with imposing<br>
masses of public buildings nobly grouped and architecturally beautiful.<br>
<br>
There was prosperity, in the air; for another boom was on.  Providence,<br>
desiring to show especial regard for the neighboring colony on the west<br>
called Western Australia--and exhibit a loving interest in its welfare<br>
which should certify to all nations the recognition of that colony's<br>
conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving, had recently<br>
conferred upon it that majestic treasury of golden riches, Coolgardie;<br>
and now South Australia had gone around the corner and taken it, giving<br>
thanks.  Everything comes to him who is patient and good, and waits.<br>
<br>
But South Australia deserves much, for apparently she is a hospitable<br>
home for every alien who chooses to come; and for his religion, too.<br>
She has a population, as per the latest census, of only 320,000-odd, and<br>
yet her varieties of religion indicate the presence within her borders of<br>
samples of people from pretty nearly every part of the globe you can<br>
think of.  Tabulated, these varieties of religion make a remarkable show.<br>
One would have to go far to find its match.  I copy here this<br>

Pity is for the living, Envy is for the dead.<br>
                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.<br>
<br>
The successor of the sheet-iron hamlet of the mangrove marshes has that<br>
other Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens.  We cannot have these<br>
paradises.  The best we could do would be to cover a vast acreage under<br>
glass and apply steam heat.  But it would be inadequate, the lacks would<br>
still be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, the<br>
atmospheric dimness, the sweaty heat--these would all be there, in place<br>
of the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze.<br>
Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out of<br>
doors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an<br>
authoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862.  The<br>
thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade.  In January, 1880,<br>
the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.]<br>
<br>
When the white man came the continent was nearly as poor, in variety of<br>
vegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has everything that grows on<br>
the earth.  In fact, not Australia only, but all Australasia has levied<br>
tribute upon the flora of the rest of the world; and wherever one goes<br>
the results appear, in gardens private and public, in the woodsy walls of<br>
the highways, and in even the forests.  If you see a curious or beautiful<br>
tree or bush or flower, and ask about it, the people, answering, usually<br>
name a foreign country as the place of its origin--India, Africa, Japan,<br>
China, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.<br>
<br>
In the Zoological Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only laughing jackass<br>
that ever showed any disposition to be courteous to me.  This one opened<br>
his head wide and laughed like a demon; or like a maniac who was consumed<br>
with humorous scorn over a cheap and degraded pun.  It was a very human<br>
laugh.  If he had been out of sight I could have believed that the<br>
laughter came from a man.  It is an odd-looking bird, with a head and<br>
beak that are much too large for its body.  In time man will exterminate<br>
the rest of the wild creatures of Australia, but this one will probably<br>
survive, for man is his friend and lets him alone.  Man always has a good<br>
reason for his charities towards wild things, human or animal when he has<br>
any.  In this case the bird is spared because he kills snakes.  If L. J.<br>
he will not kill all of them.<br>
<br>
In that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog--the dingo.  He was a<br>
beautiful creature--shapely, graceful, a little wolfish in some of his<br>
aspects, but with a most friendly eye and sociable disposition.  The<br>
dingo is not an importation; he was present in great force when the<br>
whites first came to the continent.  It may be that he is the oldest dog<br>
in the universe; his origin, his descent, the place where his ancestors<br>
first appeared, are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel's.<br>
He is the most precious dog in the world, for he does not bark.  But in<br>
an evil hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease his hunger, and<br>
that sealed his doom.  He is hunted, now, just as if he were a wolf.<br>
He has been sentenced to extermination, and the sentence will be carried<br>
out.  This is all right, and not objectionable.  The world was made for<br>
man--the white man.<br>
<br>
South Australia is confusingly named.  All of the colonies have a<br>
southern exposure except one--Queensland.  Properly speaking, South<br>
Australia is middle Australia.  It extends straight up through the center<br>
of the continent like the middle board in a center-table.  It is 2,000<br>
miles high, from south to north, and about a third as wide.  A wee little<br>
spot down in its southeastern corner contains eight or nine-tenths of its<br>
population; the other one or two-tenths are elsewhere--as elsewhere as<br>
they could be in the United States with all the country between Denver<br>
and Chicago, and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico to scatter over.  There is<br>
plenty of room.<br>
<br>
A telegraph line stretches straight up north through that 2,000 miles of<br>
wilderness and desert from Adelaide to Port Darwin on the edge of the<br>
upper ocean.  South Australia built the line; and did it in 1871-2 when<br>
her population numbered only 185,000.  It was a great work; for there<br>
were no roads, no paths; 1,300 miles of the route had been traversed but<br>
once before by white men; provisions, wire, and poles had to be carried<br>
over immense stretches of desert; wells had to be dug along the route to<br>
supply the men and cattle with water.<br>
<br>
A cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to Java and thence to<br>
India, and there was telegraphic communication with England from India.<br>
And so, if Adelaide could make connection with Port Darwin it meant<br>
connection with the whole world.  The enterprise succeeded.  One could<br>
watch the London markets daily, now; the profit to the wool-growers of<br>
Australia was instant and enormous.<br>
<br>
A telegram from Melbourne to San Francisco covers approximately 20,000<br>
miles--the equivalent of five-sixths of the way around the globe.  It has<br>
to halt along the way a good many times and be repeated; still, but<br>
little time is lost.  These halts, and the distances between them, are<br>
here tabulated.--[From "Round the Empire." (George R.  Parkin), all but<br>
the last two.]<br>

I was in Adelaide again, some months later, and saw the multitudes gather<br>
in the neighboring city of Glenelg to commemorate the Reading of the<br>
Proclamation--in 1836--which founded the Province.  If I have at any time<br>
called it a Colony, I withdraw the discourtesy.  It is not a Colony, it<br>
is a Province; and officially so.  Moreover, it is the only one so named<br>
in Australasia.  There was great enthusiasm; it was the Province's<br>
national holiday, its Fourth of July, so to speak.  It is the pre-eminent<br>
holiday; and that is saying much, in a country where they seem to have a<br>
most un-English mania for holidays.  Mainly they are workingmen's<br>
holidays; for in South Australia the workingman is sovereign; his vote is<br>
the desire of the politician--indeed, it is the very breath of the<br>
politician's being; the parliament exists to deliver the will of the<br>
workingman, and the government exists to execute it.  The workingman is a<br>
great power everywhere in Australia, but South Australia is his paradise.<br>
He has had a hard time in this world, and has earned a paradise.  I am<br>
glad he has found it.  The holidays there are frequent enough to be<br>
bewildering to the stranger.  I tried to get the hang of the system, but<br>
was not able to do it.<br>
<br>
You have seen that the Province is tolerant, religious-wise.  It is so<br>
politically, also.  One of the speakers at the Commemoration banquet--the<br>
Minister of Public Works-was an American, born and reared in New England.<br>
There is nothing narrow about the Province, politically, or in any other<br>
way that I know of.  Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet minister.<br>
No amount of horse-racing can damn this community.<br>
<br>
The mean temperature of the Province is 62 deg.  The death-rate is 13 in<br>
the 1,000--about half what it is in the city of New York, I should think,<br>
and New York is a healthy city.  Thirteen is the death-rate for the<br>
average citizen of the Province, but there seems to be no death-rate for<br>
the old people.  There were people at the Commemoration banquet who could<br>
remember Cromwell.  There were six of them.  These Old Settlers had all<br>
been present at the original Reading of the Proclamation, in 1536.  They<br>
showed signs of the blightings and blastings of time, in their outward<br>
aspect, but they were young within; young and cheerful, and ready to<br>
talk; ready to talk, and talk all you wanted; in their turn, and out of<br>
it.  They were down for six speeches, and they made 42.  The governor and<br>
the cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 speeches, and they made 6.<br>
They have splendid grit, the Old Settlers, splendid staying power.  But<br>
they do not hear well, and when they see the mayor going through motions<br>
which they recognize as the introducing of a speaker, they think they are<br>
the one, and they all get up together, and begin to respond, in the most<br>
animated way; and the more the mayor gesticulates, and shouts "Sit down!<br>
Sit down!" the more they take it for applause, and the more excited and<br>
reminiscent and enthusiastic they get; and next, when they see the whole<br>
house laughing and crying, three of them think it is about the bitter<br>
old-time hardships they are describing, and the other three think the<br>
laughter is caused by the jokes they have been uncorking--jokes of the<br>
vintage of 1836--and then the way they do go on!  And finally when ushers<br>
come and plead, and beg, and gently and reverently crowd them down into<br>
their seats, they say, "Oh, I'm not tired--I could bang along a week!"<br>
and they sit there looking simple and childlike, and gentle, and proud of<br>
their oratory, and wholly unconscious of what is going on at the other<br>
end of the room.  And so one of the great dignitaries gets a chance, and<br>
begins his carefully prepared speech, impressively and with solemnity--<br>
<br>
     "When we, now great and prosperous and powerful, bow our heads in<br>
     reverent wonder in the contemplation of those sublimities of energy,<br>
     of wisdom, of forethought, of----"<br>
<br>
Up come the immortal six again, in a body, with a joyous "Hey, I've<br>
thought of another one!" and at it they go, with might and main, hearing<br>
not a whisper of the pandemonium that salutes them, but taking all the<br>
visible violences for applause, as before, and hammering joyously away<br>
till the imploring ushers pray them into their seats again.  And a pity,<br>
too; for those lovely old boys did so enjoy living their heroic youth<br>
over, in these days of their honored antiquity; and certainly the things<br>
they had to tell were usually worth the telling and the hearing.<br>
<br>
It was a stirring spectacle; stirring in more ways than one, for it was<br>
amazingly funny, and at the same time deeply pathetic; for they had seen<br>
so much, these time-worn veterans, end had suffered so much; and had<br>
built so strongly and well, and laid the foundations of their<br>
commonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance; and had lived to see the<br>
structure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised<br>
for honorable work.<br>
<br>
One of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest afterward;<br>
things about the aboriginals, mainly.  He thought them intelligent<br>
--remarkably so in some directions--and he said that along with their<br>
unpleasant qualities they had some exceedingly good ones; and he<br>
considered it a great pity that the race had died out.  He instanced<br>
their invention of the boomerang and the "weet-weet" as evidences of<br>
their brightness; and as another evidence of it he said he had never seen<br>
a white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the miracles with<br>
those two toys that the aboriginals achieved.  He said that even the<br>
smartest whites had been obliged to confess that they could not learn the<br>
trick of the boomerang in perfection; that it had possibilities which<br>
they could not master.  The white man could not control its motions,<br>
could not make it obey him; but the aboriginal could.  He told me some<br>
wonderful things--some almost incredible things--which he had seen the<br>
blacks do with the boomerang and the weet-weet.  They have been confirmed<br>
to me since by other early settlers and by trustworthy books.<br>
<br>
It is contended--and may be said to be conceded--that the boomerang was<br>
known to certain savage tribes in Europe in Roman times.  In support of<br>
this, Virgil and two other Roman poets are quoted.  It is also contended<br>
that it was known to the ancient Egyptians.<br>
<br>
One of two things either some one with is then apparent: a boomerang<br>
arrived in Australia in the days of antiquity before European knowledge<br>
of the thing had been lost, or the Australian aboriginal reinvented it.<br>
It will take some time to find out which of these two propositions is the<br>
fact.  But there is no hurry.<br>
