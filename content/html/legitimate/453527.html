Riggs took the team to a 2&ndash;1 record in the inaugural year. He then stepped aside at the urging of the cadets, who felt that he should concentrate on his scholastic duties rather than coach the team for free. William M.

On November 21, 1982, the football program was placed on probation for a 2-year period to include the 1983 and 1984 seasons. This sanction was enforced on the program by the NCAA Committee on Infractions due to a lengthy history of recruiting violations meant to gain an athletic advantage. These recruiting violations took place from 1977 through the Tigers' <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("73921",this,"1981_clemson_tigers_football_team.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("73921")' href="/topics/1981_Clemson_Tigers_football_team">1981 National Championship season</a><span class="hp" id="m73921"><div class="hpHeader">1981 Clemson Tigers football team</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i73921"></div>The 1981 Clemson Tigers football team represented Clemson University in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

<br />
Over 150 documented violations were found to have been committed under NCAA bylaws in the categories of improper recruiting inducements, extra benefits to student-athletes, unethical conduct, improper financial aid, improper campus visits, improper transportation and entertainment, improper use of funds, improper employment, improper recruiting contact, and distribution of cash to players by members of the coaching staff.<br />
<br />
As a result of these violations, Clemson was barred from participating in bowl games following the 1982 and 1983 seasons, and barred from appearing on live television in the 1983 and 1984 seasons. Also, the number of scholarships that the university could allocate to football players was restricted to 20 (from the normal limit of 30) for the 1983-84 and 1984-85 academic years.  The Tigers, however, were allowed to keep their 1978 and 1981 ACC titles as well as the 1981 national title.<br />
<br />
Charles Alan Wright, chairman of the NCAA Committee on Infractions said at the time, "Due to the large number and serious nature of the violations in this case, the committee believed that institutional sanctions related to appearances on television and in postseason football bowl games were appropriate. In addition, because the violations indicated a pattern of improper recruiting activities, the committee determined that a two-year limitation on financial aid to new recruits should be imposed to offset any recruiting advantage that was gained improperly by the university."<br />
<br />
Just five years after their probation ended, Clemson once again found their football program accused of multiple recruiting violations in January 1990. The NCAA accused Clemson of giving cash to players and having illegal contact with recruits over a period from 1984 to 1988. In June 1990, the Tigers found themselves on probation once again, for the second time in less than a decade. This chain of events contributed, in part, to the forced resignation of popular head coach Danny Ford.<br />

Hatfield worked to clean up the program's image in the wake of the Ford-era sanctions.  However, Hatfield was never really accepted by Clemson's fans.  A common saying among Tiger fans during this time was "Howard built it. Ford tilled it. Hatfield killed it."<br />

Largely due to this discontent, school officials refused to grant him a one-year extension on his contract after the 1993 season, even though the Tigers had rebounded from 5&ndash;6 in 1992 to a solid 8&ndash;3 record that year and were invited to the Peach Bowl.

Their first meeting, in 1999, was the first time in Division I-A history that a father and a son met as opposing head coaches in a football game. Bobby Bowden won the first four matchups extending FSU's winning streak over Clemson to 11 dating back to 1992. Since 2002, Clemson won 4 of the last 5, including a 26-10 win in Clemson over then-#3 FSU, the highest ranking opponent to ever be defeated by the Tigers. Also during this time the Tigers recorded a 27-20 win in Tallahassee&nbsp;in 2006 which broke a 17-year losing streak in Doak Campbell Stadium. 2007 was the last Bowden Bowl game as Tommy resigned as head coach in October 2008. As of 2011, Florida State leads the overall series 17-8.<br />
<H3>Georgia</H3>
The Bulldogs and the Tigers have been perpetual thorns in one another’s sides; Clemson’s only regular-season losses of the 1978, 1982, and 1991 campaigns all came between the hedges, whereas Georgia’s only regular-season setback during the three years of the Herschel Walker era came in Death Valley during Danny Ford’s 1981 national championship run.<br />
<br />
During the two programs’ simultaneous glory days of the early 1980s, no rivalry in all of college football was more important at the national level, as Scott Woerner’s dramatic returns in 1980 and the nine turnovers forced by the Tigers the following fall effectively settled the eventual No. 1 ranking. Likewise, no rivalry of that period was more competitive, as evidenced by the critical eleventh-hour field goals kicked by Kevin Butler in 1984 and by David Treadwell more than once later in the decade. Despite blowouts in 1990, 1994, and 2003, the series typically has remained competitive in more recent days, as two of the last three meetings were decided by two points in 1995 and three points in 2002. However, Georgia maintains a 41-17-4 lead in the series, including 5 wins in a row dating back to 1991.<br />
<H3>Auburn</H3>
These old rivals first played in 1899, but until 2010, had not faced each other in the regular season since 1971. Auburn leads the overall series 34-12-2 and had won 14 games in a row, dating back to 1952, before Clemson snapped the streak in 2011, by beating #21 ranked Auburn 38-24 in Death Valley, in front of a crowd of exactly 82,000.
