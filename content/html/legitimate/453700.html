It was founded 1929 by Howard A. Cowden&nbsp;as the <b>Union Oil Company</b> (as a successor to Cowden Oil Company which he founded the year before). In 1935 it took the name <b>Consumers Cooperative Association</b> (CCA), and in 1966  <b>Farmland Industries, Inc.</b><br />

It had 16,000 employees in all 50 states and 90 countries.  In 1977 it ranked #78 on the Fortune 100&nbsp;company list.  In 2001, its annual revenues were in excess of $11.8 billion.  It was listed as one of Fortune's "most admired" companies.  It ranked #170 on the Fortune List when it dissolved.<br />
<br />
The cooperative provided both agricultural supply and marketing services ranging from petroleum refining, fertilizer manufacture, feeds, shipping, crop production, livestock production, and refrigerated foods sales and marketing.

The reorganization process resulted in the sale of the cooperative's assets, with all creditors repaid by 2006.  According to JPMorgan, the liquidating trustee, unsecured creditors received $891&nbsp;million, which was 104&nbsp;cents on the dollar, the maximum allowed by law, and allows for interest.<br />
