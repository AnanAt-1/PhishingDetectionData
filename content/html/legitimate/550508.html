Excerpt from the introduction
</h2>




<p>The following is an excerpt from the introduction of the RE/Search book entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1889307017/metasoul"><i>Incredibly Strange Movies</i></a> by V. Vale and Andera Juno.
<blockquote>
<p>This is a functional guide to territory largely neglected by the <a href="FilmCriticism.html">film-criticism</a> establishment--encompassing tens of thousands of films. Most of the films discussed test the limits of contemporary (middle class) cultural acceptability, mainly because in varying ways they don't meet certain "standards" utilized in evaluating direction, acting, dialogue, sets, continuity, technical cinematography, etc. Many of the films are overtly <a href="Low.html">"lower class" or "low brow"</a> in content and art direction. However, a high percentage of these works disdained by the would-be dictators of public opinion are sources of pure enjoyment and delight, despite improbable plots, "bad" acting, or ragged <a href="FilmTechnique.html">film technique</a>. At issue is the notion of "good taste," which functions as a filter to block out entire areas of experience judged--and damned--as unworthy of investigation. 


<p>The concepts of "<a href="GoodTaste.html">good taste</a>" are intricately woven into society's control process and class structure. Aesthetics are not an objective body of laws suspended above us like <a href="Plato.html">Plato's</a> supreme "Ideas"; they are rooted in the fundamental mechanics of how to <a href="Hegemony.html">control</a> the population and maintain the status quo.

<p>Our sophisticated, "democratic" Western civilization regulates the population's access to information, as well as its innermost attitudes, through <a href="Media.html">media</a>--particularly <a href="Film.html">film</a> and <a href="Video.html">video</a>. The power to literally create <a href="Desire.html">desire</a>, <a href="Fashion.html">fashion</a>, consumer <a href="Trendy.html">trends</a>, <a href="Opinion.html">opinions</a>, aspirations and even one's very <a href="Identity.html">identity</a> is expressed through film and video. This force--power through persuasion--reaches deep into the backbrain, rendering more brutal, physical control tactics obsolete. Since the '60s, film has ceased being a popular creative medium. 

<p>The whole '60s avant-garde filmmaking, from <a href="StanBrakhage.html">Brakhage</a> to [Bruce] Connor [Conner?], was based on the cheap availability of 16mm film, cameras, etc; many of the films in this book were originally shot in 16mm. After this became too expensive, Super-8 became the medium of choice. Several years ago, the major manufacturers began de-emphasizing professional-quality Super-8 cameras, film stocks, etc, saying, "People don't really want it. Editing is too hard for most people, and everyone's switching to video, anyway." The result: the number of <a href="LowBudget.html">low-budget</a> films being produced has dropped drastically.

<p>The value of low-budget films is: they can be transcendent of expressions of a single person's individual vision and quirky originality. When a corporation decides to invest $20 million in a film, a chain of command regulates each step, and no one person is allowed free rein. Meeting with lawyers, accountants, and corporate boards are what films in Hollywood are all about.

<p>So what makes films like <a href="HGLewis.html">Herschell Gordon Lewis'</a> <i>The Wizard of Gore</i> or Ray Dennis Steckler's <i>The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies worthwhile</i>? First of all: unfettered <a href="Creativity.html">creativity</a>. Often the films are eccentric--even extreme--presentations by individuals freely expressing their imaginations, who throughout the filmmaking process improvise creative solutions to problems posed either by circumstance or budget--mostly the latter. Secondly, they often present unpopular--even radical--views addressing social, political, racial or sexual inequities, hypocrisy in religion or government; or, in other ways they assault taboos related to the presentation of sexuality, violence, and other mores. (Cf. <a href="GeorgeRomero.html">George Romero's</a> <i>Dead</i> trilogy which features intelligent, problem-solving black heroes, or Russ Meyer's <i>Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!</i> which showcases tough girls outwitting--and even physically outdoing--sexist men.) Thirdly, occasionally films are made of such unique stature (Cf. Daughter of Horror) as to stand virtually outside any genre or classification, thus extending the boundaries of what has been done in the medium, as well as providing--at best--inexplicably marvelous experiences.
