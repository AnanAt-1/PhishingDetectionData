The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years.   In 1704, in part due to fear the fraternization of French soldiers with native females may lead to conflict, Bienville arranged for the importation of twenty-four young French women.  By tradition the young ladies were selected from convents, though most were likely from poor families, and they traveled to the New World with their possessions in small trunks known as cassettes, thus they are known in local histories as The casquette girls in early accounts and by the English translation of casket girls in later tradition.<br />
<br />
The young ladies were lodged in Bienville's home under the care of his housekeeper, a French-Canadian woman known as Madame Langlois.  (By tradition she was a widowed cousin to Bienville and his brothers, but there is no confirmation to this.)  Madame Langlois had learned from local native tribes the arts of cooking local produce and imparted this knowledge to her charges in what is generally heralded as the origin of Creole cuisine.  The names and fates of most of the Casquette Girls is uncertain but at least some remained in the colony and married French soldiers as intended, the first recorded birth of a white child occurring in 1705.<br />
<br />
The population of the colony fluctuated over the next generation, growing to 281 persons by 1708 yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease. In 1709, a great flood overflowed <i>Fort Louis de la Mobile</i>: as a consequence of this and the disease outbreaks, Bienville ordered the settlement to move downriver to the present site of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("49945",this,"mobile,_alabama.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("49945")' href="/topics/Mobile,_Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a><span class="hp" id="m49945"><div class="hpHeader">Mobile, Alabama</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i49945"></div>Mobile  is the third most populous city in the Southern US state of Alabama and is the county seat of Mobile County.

In 1725, Bienville was recalled to France. He left the colony in the hands of Pierre Dugué de Boisbriant, succeeded by Étienne Périer. Bienville resumed his post in Louisiana in 1733.
