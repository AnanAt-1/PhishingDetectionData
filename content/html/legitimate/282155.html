<h4>HardBack is Open-Source software</h4>

<p>
HardBack is a hard disc backup utility which allows you to protect 
your data from unforeseen events.  If your hard disc crashes or you 
accidentally delete an important file, having a backup copy can 
save you a great deal of trouble and prevent you losing what may 
be many hours work.  It can also help, for example, if your 
computer is stolen or some errant virus deletes your hard work.</p>

<p>HardBack supports removable discs and long filenames (up to 255 characters), and allows incremental backups and compresses them.  Restoring backups is via an easy to use Filer-like display.</p>

<p>HardBack was formerly a Shareware product, but has been released under the <a href="artistic.html">Artistic Licence</a>, to allow others to have access to it and the source code.  I would like to thank registered users for their support over the years, and will continue to support them.</p>

<p>The source is included, so anyone is welcome to make any changes or updates as they wish.  If you would like any changes integrated into the main version, please email them to theo [at@] markettos.org.uk.</p>

<h4>Downloading</h4>
<p>Current version is release 3.10 (composed of !Backup v3.100, !Restore
v3.100, manual v2.27).  Version histories of <a href="backver.txt">Backup</a> and <a href="restver.txt">Restore</a> are available.
Release 3.10 is a beta RISC OS 5 compatible version (as yet untested on such
a machine - I'd be grateful for any comments).
