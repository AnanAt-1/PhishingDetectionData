            <div align="justify"> !Tortoisesoft Enterprises PuzzleIT is an educational 
              and recreational program which creates a multi-piece rectangular 
              shaped puzzle from any user supplied picture. The program can generate 
              puzzles with between just two or one hundred pieces in any screen 
              mode and can save part done screens for later completion. </div>

        <p> This facility will be helpful for recording a student's progress in 
          an educational situation. Puzzles which can be created range from the 
          very easy to the remarkably taxing and yet the computer can tell the 
          user where to put each piece if required.Hint modes can be turned on 
          and off during use as can a picture of the completed puzzle. PuzzleIT 
          currently is only available for the RISC OS range but may be ported 
          to Windows if demand requires. </p>
