In the old days before local cinemas were converted into bingo halls,
back when they still played films, many people enjoyed
a type of film comedy and drama that has since collectively become known
as "Ealing". Ealing, the company, originated in 1938 during the early
sound era. Under the stewardship of Michael Balcon they produced
many fine films which deserve to be better known.
<p>

Physically the studios were (and still are) at Ealing Green in West London. In 1929 London theatre 
producer Basil Dean formed Associated Radio Pictures and raised finance to build the Ealing Studios
which were completed in 1931. The site was only yards away from the early Will Barker Studios which 
opened in 1896. The studios were the first purpose built sound stage in Britain. While in charge of 
production at Ealing Dean built up the careers of Gracie Fields and George Formby, both champions of 
working class comedy. Many up and coming stars worked at the studios during the 30s including Margaret 
Lockwood, and Madeleine Carroll, also directors such as Carol Reed began learning their craft there. 
In 1933 the company became Associated Talking Pictures and a second sound stage was completed. ATP 
made films at the studios and rented out the space to other companies. So that in 1933 Gloria Swanson 
made <i>Perfect Understanding</i> there with Laurence Olivier. All together about 60 pictures were 
made there over the seven years from 1931-1938.<p>

In 1938 Dean left ATP after disagreements with his fellow directors and returned to theatre production.
<a href="balconm.html">Michael Balcon</a> former head of production at Gainsborough and Gaumont British was recommended as a 
replacement, he had recently been working for the British arm of MGM and although the three films he
produced were successes he had hated every minute. He left MGM and started an independent production, with no studio of his own
he rented the ATP studios at Ealing. One of the directors at Ealing, Reginald Baker asked him to take 
charge of production and his film <a href="gaunt.html"><i>The Gaunt Stranger</i></a> (1938) became 
the first Ealing Studios production. The ATP name was phased out at the same time. Several key 
personnel came to Ealing from Gaumont British including Sidney Gilliat and Robert Stevenson.<p>

In 1944 a deal was forged with Rank whereby Rank provided financial backing and distribution but 
Balcon still had a  free hand in production this deal lasted until 1955 when the studios were sold to the BBC. 
However, Balcon made a deal with MGM and for two more years produced Ealing films at the MGM studios 
in Borehamwood.<p>

The atmosphere at Ealing was warm and many people remarked upon it's familial feel. The studio produced
on average five or six features per year, with craftsmanship and quality being the major production
goals. There were regular brainstorming sessions and constructive criticism was accepted from everyone from
Balcon down to the tea boy.
In 1938 Balcon was already aware that war was inevitable and in 1939 began to think of ways to 
make film work for the national interest. Many Ealing films typify 'middle England' both throughout
the war and after it.<p>

With the onset of war Balcon decided to change the format of the films produced by Ealing and from
this period onwards the majority were made from original screenplays rather than books or plays.
Personnel however didn't change drastically, in fact many actors appeared again and again in Ealing
films, in larger or smaller roles which perhaps partly accounts for the family feeling that pervaded
the studios. Technical staff were fairly constant with some small interchange between directing, writing
and editing. However there were few women employed behind the scenes, and in fact, very few films of
special interest to women made.
An already forming realist slant to film-making was strengthened when Cavalcanti joined the company in 
1942, in fact Ealing had been making documentaries and Ministry of Information films since 1940.<p>

The types of films made at Ealing during the war are naturally dominated by war films, Balcon felt
an obligation to make the film industry work for the national good. So in films such as <i>The Big
Blockade</i>, <i>San Demetrio, London</i> and <i>For Those in Peril</i>, the effort and example of 
the forces and civilians alike are presented to boost morale. At the same time films of a more
entertaining nature were produced but which still managed to take swipes at the enemy - <i>The Ghost
of St Michael's</i>, <i>Fiddlers Three</i>.
From the beginning of 1945 when the end of the war was in sight the main objective of the British
Film Industry was to get back into the global marketplace and from <i>Dead of Night</i> onwards
there is a widening of themes portrayed. Paramount in Balcon's mind was the need to portray "a projection
of the true Briton to the rest of the world" (Balcon, 1945),  not only to foreign markets but also 
to a war weary public at home
who had won the war but were still in the grip of rationing and austerity. The message was simple - 
the public may not be benefiting materially from victory, but morally and spiritually they could not be
beaten. They were allowed and always had been allowed their eccentricities, their rights to free speech
etc etc which the Germans had tried to take away, and Balcon's films - especially the comedies 
emphasized this and implied that this was what made Britain great.<p>
Balcon and others in the industry were also aware that cinema audiences were much more sophisticated than
in the 1930s, they no longer wanted to be presented with a set of ideas or ideals which they should
aspire to. Instead they needed films that provoked thought and discussion, that questioned the staus
quo. For example <i>Passport to Pimlico</i> and <i>Dance Hall</i>. Post-war films generally tended to be less class
conscious, less middle class, they presented ordinary people getting on with their lives rather than 
moneyed professionals with large cars and larger wardrobes. Alongside the more realist film school 
was the escapist film - usually a costume piece, to which audiences flocked despite the critics
dismissing them as inconsequential. The public wanted to escape the mundane everyday life of post-war 
Britain, where the queues were as long as in 1943, there were fuel shortages in winter and the Empire 
was quickly disintegrating.
Ealing made it's fair shair of costume dramas starting with <i>Pink String and Sealing Wax</i>, then
<i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> and <i>The Loves of Joanna Godden</i>. It's final costume drama <i>Saraband
for Dead Lovers</i> was also it's first Technicolor film but was a box-office disaster.
<p>

In 1947 <i>The Cinema</i> notes Balcon's special attention towards film music. "John Ireland turned to
film music-writing for the first time when he composed the score for <i>The Overlanders</i>. Georges
Auric has written music for <a href="hue.html"><i>Hue and Cry</i></a>, Lord Berners the music for <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>
and Vaughan Williams for <i>The Loves of Joanna Godden</i>.<br>

<i>It Always Rains on Sunday</i> and <i>Frieda</i> are in the top 10 favourite films of 1947 as 
voted in the Daily Mail Film Awards. As are actresses Mai Zetterling and Googie Withers and actors
David Farrar and John McCallum. 1947 also saw the first of the now classic Ealing comedies - 
<a href="hue.html"><i>Hue and Cry</i></a>.
<p>
In 1948 the Third Royal Command Film Performance was <i>Scott of the Antarctic</i> a truthful and
acclaimed account of Scott's 1912 expedition to the South Pole<p>

In the <i>Picture Show</i> Annual of 1952 Edith Mepean their long-standing reporter on the British Studios
said "The Ealing Studios appear to have decided on a policy of human and unusual films, many dealing with
the fascinating theme of London life..... Ealing Studios have no contract stars yet they have discovered
and made many stars". She also emphasized the importance of editing at Ealing. Many editors and directors
interchanged between the two disciplines.<p>

In 1955 the BBC bought the studios and Balcon cut a deal with MGM to continue making Ealing films
at their studios in Borehamwood..<br>

"There we shall go on making dramas with a documentary background and comedies about ordinary 
people with the stray eccentric amongst them - films about daydreamers, mild anarchists, little 
men who long to kick the boss in the teeth." (Balcon, 1956) However, in 1957 Ealing closed production.
It had been struggling for a few years, from about 1954 there were more mediocre films than good films.
Television was taking it's toll on the whole industry, new techniques and European styles were
making the Eaing product look old-fashioned. Later movies of note are <i>The Ladykillers</i> and
<i>The Long Arm</i>

In 1995 the studios were purchased by the National Film & Television School (NFTS)
