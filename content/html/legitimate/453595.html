Remaining true to his gospel roots, Dante' continues to play at his local church and has recorded with artists such as Demetrius Tolefree, James Jackson and Juanita Wynn just to name a few.

Dante can also "Get Big" when he gets his rock on with San Jose Hard Rock band LoveKraft.<br />

Most recently Dante' has added musical director & producer to his resume, and as result, he has collaborated on a number of television, film, commercial, and video game projects. Dante' can be seen on Comedy Central's "Weekends at the DL" where he performs with the Dwayne Wiggins Band. On any given night Dante' will let loose with some amazing chops and always, a tight groove. If that isn't enough, he is currently on tour with award winning artist Eric Benet.
