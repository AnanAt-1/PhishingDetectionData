Parts of his disseration, <i>Limits of Rationality: A Critical Study of Some Logical Problems of Contemporary Pragmatism and Related Movements</i>, were subsequently published as <i>The Retreat to Commitment</i> in the same year.<br />
<br />
Bartley and Popper had a great admiration for each other, driven by their common stand against justificationism, a view which Popper fought at the British Academy's Annual Philosophical Lecture in 1960 for the first time. However, at the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science at Bedford College, University of London, 11–17 July 1965, they came into a conflict with each other. Bartley had presented a paper 'Theories of demarcation between science and metaphysics' and had attacked Popper in it sharply. He accused Popper of a positivist attitude in his early works and proposed that Popper's demarcation criterion was not as important as Popper thought. Popper took this as a personal attack, and Bartley took his reply as ignorant towards his criticism. Their friendship was not restored until 1974, after the publication of <i>The Philosophy of Karl Popper</i>. Bartley toned down his views on Popper's demarcation, however, as regards content of these views, the differences remained.<br />

This matter caused enormous controversy in intellectual and philosophical circles; many perceived it as a posthumous "attack" on Wittgenstein. Some foreign editions of the book, like the Spanish, were printed with the "offending" material excised.  In a second edition of the biography, Bartley answered the objections of critics, pointing out that Wittgenstein's period of active homosexuality is verified by the philosopher's own private writings, included his coded diaries; extensive confirmation was also available from people who knew Wittgenstein in the period between the two World Wars in Vienna, including ex-lovers. Bartley also considers, and rejects, the idea of a connection between the private life and the philosophy.<br />

Bartley is perhaps best known today for his work in extending Popperian epistemology, discussed in his book <i>The Retreat to Commitment</i>. In it, he describes Pancritical rationalism (PCR), a development of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("93988",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("93988")' href="/topics/Critical_rationalism">critical rationalism</a><span class="hp" id="m93988"><div class="hpHeader">Critical rationalism</div><div class="hpContent">Critical rationalism is an epistemological philosophy advanced by Karl Popper.

PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR, and never resorts to authority for justification.<br />

Parts of Popper's <i>Realism and the Aim of Science</i>, a book which Bartley edited, and the Addendum to the fourth edition to <i>The Open Society and its Enemies</i> contain passages that are commonly interpreted as Popper's acceptance of Bartley's views. <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("92731",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("92731")' href="/topics/Mariano_Artigas">Mariano Artigas</a><span class="hp" id="m92731"><div class="hpHeader">Mariano Artigas</div><div class="hpContent">Mariano Artigas  was a Spanish physicist, philosopher and writer.

At the time of his death, Bartley had just finished his last book, <i>Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth: On Universities and the Wealth of Nations</i>.  Other works he was preparing at that time included writing a biography, and editing the collected works, of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("39590",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("39590")' href="/topics/Friedrich_Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a><span class="hp" id="m39590"><div class="hpHeader">Friedrich Hayek</div><div class="hpContent">Friedrich August Hayek CH  , born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek, was an economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism and free-market capitalism against socialist and collectivist thought...</div><br></span>.  The latter is still being completed after Bartley's death by his colleagues.  Also unfinished is a biography of Karl R. Popper. Both biographies were already in an advanced stage at the time of Bartley's death.<br />
