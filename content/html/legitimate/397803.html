<h2> The End of the Universe </h2>
<h4> John Baez </h4>
<h4> February 7, 2016 </h4>

It's interesting to ponder the end of the universe.  And I'm not
talking the short run, like how the <A HREF =
"http://www.scotese.com/future2.htm">Earth's continents will
collide</a> in 250 million years, or how in 1.1 billion years the <a
href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#The_Sun_and_planetary_environments">Sun
will become 10% brighter than it is today</a> and start a runaway
greenhouse effect leading to a complete loss of the Earth's oceans, or
how the <a href =
"http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~dubinski/tflops/">Andromeda galaxy will
collide with the Milky Way</a> in 3 billion years, shaking loose many
planets in many solar systems, or how the <a href =
"http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Lectures/vistas97.html">Sun
will become a white dwarf</a> in 7.8 billion years.  I'm talking about
the <em>long term</em> future!

<p>
In short: the end of everything.

<p>
For a long time, the big question was whether there was enough matter
in the universe to make it recollapse, or whether it would expand
forever.  But in the late 1990's, astronomical observations began to 
suggest that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up!  
<p>

Let's suppose this is true, and let's assume the most popular
explanation for it: namely, that there is a nonzero <a href =
"vacuum.html">cosmological constant</a>.  A cosmological constant with
the right sign makes the energy density of the vacuum positive, but
makes its pressure negative - and 3 times as big.  This makes the
universe tend to expand.  Normal matter makes the universe tend to
recollapse.  If the effect of the cosmological constant ever beats out
the effect of normal matter, the universe will keep expanding, making
the density of normal matter less... so the cosmological constant will
ultimately win hands down, and the universe will eventually expand at an
almost exponential rate.

<p>
Let's suppose this happens.  What will be the ultimate fate
of the universe?

<p>
First let me set the stage.  What happens in the short run, i.e. 
the first 10<sup>23</sup> years or so?

<p> 
First, galaxies will keep colliding.  These collisions seem to
destroy spiral galaxies &mdash; they fuse into bigger elliptical
galaxies.  We can already see this happening here and there, and our
own Milky Way may have a near collision with Andromeda in only 3.85
billion years or so.  If this happens, a bunch of new stars will be
born from the shock waves due to colliding interstellar gas.  By 7
billion years we expect that Andromeda and the Milky Way will merge
and form a large elliptical galaxy.  Unfortunately, elliptical
galaxies lack spiral arms, which seem to be a crucial part of the star
formation process, so star formation may cease even before the raw
materials run out.

<p>
Of course, no matter what happens, the birth of new stars must
eventually cease, since there's a limited amount of hydrogen, helium,
and other stuff that can undergo fusion.

<p>
This means that all the stars will eventually burn out.  The longest
lived are the red dwarf stars, the smallest stars capable of
supporting fusion today, with a mass about 0.08 times that of the Sun.
These will run out of hydrogen about 10<sup>13</sup> years from now,
and slowly cool.

<p>
A star becomes a white dwarf &mdash; and eventually a black dwarf when
it cools &mdash; if its core, made of highly compressed matter, is
lighter than 1.4 solar masses.  In this case the core can be held up
by the 'electron degeneracy pressure' caused by the Pauli exclusion
principle, which works even at zero temperature.  But if the core is
heavier than this, it collapses!  It becomes a neutron star if it's
between 1.4 and 2 solar masses, and a black hole if it's more massive.

<p>
In about 10<sup>14</sup> years, all normal star formation
processes will have ceased, and the universe will have a
population of stars consisting of about 55% white dwarfs, 45% brown
dwarfs and a small number of neutron stars and black holes. Star
formation will continue at a very slow rate due to collisions between
brown and/or white dwarfs.

<p> 
The black holes will suck up some of the other stars they encounter.
This is especially true for the big black holes at the galactic centers,
which power radio galaxies if they swallow stars at a sufficiently rapid
rate.  But most of the stars, as well as interstellar gas and dust, will
eventually be hurled into intergalactic space.  This happens to a star
whenever it accidentally reaches escape velocity through its random
encounters with other stars.  It's a slow process, but computer
simulations show that about 90% of the mass of the galaxies will
eventually "boil off" this way &mdash; while the rest becomes a big black
hole.  

<p>
(It may seem odd that first the galaxies form by gravitational
attraction of matter and then fall apart again by "boiling off", but
the point is, intergalactic matter is less dense now than it was when
galaxies first formed, thanks to the expansion of the universe.  When
the galaxies first formed, there was lots of gas around.  Now the
galaxies are essentially isolated &mdash; intergalactic space is
almost a vacuum.  And you can show in the <em>really long</em> run,
any isolated system consisting of sufficiently many point particles
interacting gravitationally &mdash; even an apparently
"gravitationally bound" system &mdash; will "boil off" as individual
particles randomly happen to acquire enough kinetic energy to reach
escape velocity.  Computer calculations already suggest that the solar
system will fall apart this way, barring other interventions.  With
the galaxies it's even more certain to happen, since there are more
particles involved, so things are more chaotic.)

<p>
How long will all this take?  Well, the white dwarfs will cool to black
dwarfs with a temperature of at most 5 Kelvin in about 10<sup>17</sup>
years, and the galaxies will boil away by about 10<sup>19</sup> years.
Most planets will have already been knocked off their orbits by then,
but any that are still orbiting stars will spiral in thanks to gravitational
radiation in about 10<sup>20</sup> years.

<p>
Then what?  Well, in about 10<sup>23</sup> years the dead stars will
actually boil off from the galactic clusters, not just the galaxies,
so the clusters will disintegrate.  At this point the cosmic
background radiation will have cooled to about 10<sup>-13</sup>
Kelvin, and most things will be at about that temperature unless
proton decay or some other such process keeps them warmer.

<p>
Okay, so now we have a bunch of isolated black dwarfs, neutron stars,
and black holes together with atoms and molecules of gas, dust particles, 
and of course planets and other crud, all very close to absolute zero.  

<p>
As the universe expands these things eventually spread out to the point where 
each one is completely alone in the vastness of space.  If dark energy works
as we expect, the distance between things that aren't gravitationally bound to each other will double every 12 billion years.  By the time the galactic
clusters boil off, the Universe will have expanded by a factor of roughly

<div align = "center">
10<sup>10<sup>13</sup></sup>
</div>

<p>
So what happens next?

<p>
Well, everybody loves to talk about how all matter eventually turns to
iron thanks to quantum tunnelling, since iron is the nucleus with the
least binding energy, but unlike the processes I've described so far,
this one actually takes quite a while.  For black dwarfs of masses
between 1.35 and 1.16 solar masses, this will take between
10<sup>1100</sup> years and 10<sup>3200</sup> years, with the lightest
ones taking the most time.

<p>   
It's quite possible that proton decay or something else will happen
long before this gets a chance to occur.  But if it does, something
exciting will happen!  When a black dwarf with a mass over 1.2 times 
that of our Sun turns to iron, it will collapse under its own gravity, 
and explode into a supernova!  These supernovae may be the last really 
energetic events in our Universe.

<p>
Smaller things may eventually "sublimate" or "ionize", gradually
losing atoms or even electrons and protons, despite the low
temperature.  Just to be specific, let's consider the ionization of
hydrogen gas &mdash; although the argument is much more general.  If
you take a box of hydrogen and keep making the box bigger while
keeping its temperature fixed, it will eventually ionize.  This
happens no matter how low the temperature is, as long as it's not
exactly absolute zero &mdash; which is forbidden by the 3rd law of
thermodynamics, anyway.

<p>
This may seem odd, but the reason is simple: in thermal equilibrium
any sort of stuff minimizes its free energy, E - TS: the energy minus
the temperature times the entropy.  This means there is a competition
between wanting to minimize its energy and wanting to maximize its
entropy.  Maximizing entropy becomes more important at higher
temperatures; minimizing energy becomes more important at lower
temperatures &mdash; but both effects matter as long as the temperature
isn't zero or infinite.

<p>
Think about what this means for our box of hydrogen.  On the one hand,
ionized hydrogen has more energy than hydrogen atoms or molecules.
This makes hydrogen want to stick together in atoms and molecules,
especially at low temperatures.  But on the other hand, ionized
hydrogen has more entropy, since the electrons and protons are more
free to roam.  And this entropy difference gets bigger and bigger as
we make the box bigger.  So no matter how low the temperature is, as
long as it's above zero, the hydrogen will eventually ionize as we
keep expanding the box.

<p>
(In fact, this is related to the "boiling off" process that I mentioned
already: we can use thermodynamics to see that the stars will boil off
the galaxies as they approach thermal equilibrium, as long as the
density of galaxies is low enough.)  

<p>
However, there's a complication: in the expanding universe, the
temperature is not constant &mdash; it decreases!  

<p> 
So the question is, which effect wins as the universe expands: the
decreasing density (which makes matter want to ionize) or the
decreasing temperature (which makes it want to stick together)?

<p>
In the short run this is a fairly complicated question, but in the
long run, things may simplify: if the universe is expanding
exponentially thanks to a nonzero cosmological constant, the density
of matter obviously goes to zero.  But the temperature does not go to
zero.  It approaches a particular nonzero value!  So all forms of
matter made from protons, neutrons and electrons will eventually
ionize!

<p> 
Why does the temperature approach a particular nonzero value, and
what is this value?  Well, in a universe whose expansion keeps
accelerating, each pair of freely falling observers will eventually no
longer be able to see each other, because they get redshifted out of
sight.  This effect is very much like the horizon of a black hole -
it's called a "cosmological horizon".  And, like the horizon of a
black hole, a cosmological horizon emits thermal radiation at a
specific temperature.  This radiation is called <a href =
"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/hawking.html">Hawking
radiation</a>.  Its temperature depends on the value of the
cosmological constant.  If we make a rough guess at the cosmological
constant, the temperature we get is about 10<sup>-30</sup> Kelvin.

<p>
This is very cold, but given a low enough density of matter, this
temperature is enough to eventually ionize all forms of matter made of
protons, neutrons and electrons!  Even something big like a neutron
star should slowly, slowly dissipate.  (The crust of a neutron star is
not made of neutronium: it's mainly made of iron.)

<p>
But what about the black holes?

<p>
Well, they probably evaporate due to Hawking radiation: a solar-mass
black hole should do so in 10<sup>67</sup> years, and a really big one,
comparable to the mass of a galaxy, should take about 10<sup>99</sup>
years. 

<p>
Actually, a black hole only shrinks by evaporation when it's in 
an enviroment cooler than the temperature of its Hawking radiation &mdash; 
otherwise, it grows by swallowing thermal radiation.   
The Hawking temperature of a solar-mass black hole is about 6 &times; 
10<sup>-8</sup> Kelvin, and in general, it's inversely proportional to
the black hole's mass.  The universe should cool down below 10<sup>-8</sup>
Kelvin very soon compared to the 10<sup>67</sup> years it takes for
a solar-mass black holes to evaporate.  However, before that
time, such a black hole would grow by absorbing background radiation &mdash; 
which makes its temperature decrease and help it grow more!  

<p>
If a black hole ever grew to about 10<sup>22</sup> solar masses, its
Hawking temperature would go below 10<sup>-30</sup> Kelvin, which
would allow it to keep growing even when the universe has cooled to
its minimum temperature.  Of course, 10<sup>22</sup> solar masses is
huge &mdash; about the mass of the currently observable universe!  But
it would take a nontrivial calculation to show that reasonable-sized
black holes have no chance of getting this big.  I think it's true,
but I haven't done the calculation.

<p>
For now, let's assume it's true: all black holes will eventually
shrink away and disappear &mdash; none of them grow big enough to stick
around when it gets <em>really</em> cold.

<p>
As black holes evaporate, they will emit photons and other particles in
the process, so for a while there will be a bit of radiation like this
running around.  That livens things up a little bit &mdash; but this process 
will eventually cease.

<p>
What about the neutron stars?  Well, if they don't ionize first,
ultimately they should quantum-tunnel into becoming black holes, 
which then Hawking-radiate away.

<p>
Similarly, if smaller black dwarfs and planets and the like don't
evaporate and their protons don't decay, they may quantum-tunnel into
becoming solid iron.  And then, if this iron doesn't evaporate and
nothing else happens, these balls of iron will eventually
quantum-tunnel into becoming black holes, which then Hawking-radiate
away.  This would take about

<div align = "center">
10<sup>10<sup>26</sup></sup>
</div>

years.  

<p>
This is a much longer time than any I've mentioned so far, so I
wouldn't be surprised if some other effect we haven't thought about
happens first.  Indeed, this whole discussion should be taken with a
grain of salt that keeps expanding as we go further into the future:
discoveries in physics yet to come may drastically change the end of
this story.  It's also possible that the intervention of intelligent
life could change things &mdash; I've avoided discussing that here.
Cosmology has been full of surprises lately, and there will probably
be more to come.

<p>
But the overall picture seems to lean heavily towards a far future
where everything consists of isolated stable particles: electrons,
neutrinos, and protons (unless protons decay).  If the scenario I'm
describing is correct, the density of these particles will go to zero,
and eventually each one will be cut off from all the rest by a
cosmological horizon, making them unable to interact.  Of course there
will be photons as well, but these will eventually come into thermal
equilibrium forming blackbody radiation at the temperature of the
cosmological horizon &mdash; perhaps about 10<sup>-30</sup> Kelvin or
so.

<p>
This is why it's really a bad idea to keep putting things off for tomorrow.

<p>
However, Leonard Susskind has recently pointed out that in thermal
equilibrium at any nonzero temperature, any system exhibits random
fluctuations.  The lower the temperature they smaller these are, but
they are always there.  These fluctuations randomly explore the space
of all possible states of your system.  So eventually, if you wait
long enough, these random fluctuations will carry the system to
whatever state you like.  Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration: these
fluctuations can't violate conservation laws.  But conservation of
energy doesn't count here, since at a nonzero temperature, a system is
really in a state of all possible energies.  So it's possible, for
example, that a ice cube at the freezing point of water will melt or
even <em>boil</em> due to random fluctuations.  The reason we never
see this happen is that such big fluctuations are incredibly rare.

<p>
Carrying this thought to a ridiculous extreme, what this means is that
even if the universe consists of more or less empty space at a
temperature of 10<sup>-30</sup> kelvin, random fluctuations will
occaisionally create atoms, molecules...  and even solar systems and
galaxies!  The bigger the fluctuation, the more rarely it happens -
but eternity is a long time.  So eventually there will arise, sheerly
by chance, a person just like you, with memories just like yours,
reading a webpage just like this.

<p>
In short: maybe the universe has <em>already</em> ended!

<p>
However, the time it takes for really big fluctuations like this to
occur is truly huge.  It dwarfs all the time scales I've mentioned so
far.  So, it's probably not worth worrying about this issue too much:
we don't know enough physics to make reliable predictions on such long
time scales.

The hypothesis of proton decay is less fashionable now than when this
book was written, since people have looked very hard for it and not
found it &mdash; pushing up the lower bound on the proton lifetime to
10<sup>32</sup> years.  Also, the nonzero mass of the neutrino was
discovered after this book was written, as was the apparent nonzero
cosmological constant.  Nonetheless, it includes some dicussion of the
effects of a nonzero cosmological constant, and notes that in a
universe with ever-accelerating expansion due to a cosmological
constant, all computation must eventually cease due to a heat death,
as explained above.

<p>
Tipler subsequently wrote a book of speculations about the fate of
intelligent in the far future. He assumed there would be a big crunch,
which no longer seems to be true, so I do not use his ideas here.

<p>
Freeman Dyson has discussed the fate of intelligent life in the far
future assuming a perpetually expanding universe, but assuming the
cosmological constant is zero.  In this situation the temperature of
the universe decreases ever closer to absolute zero, and Dyson figured
out that in principle, intelligent life could last forever and think
an infinite number of thoughts, although slower and slower:

</li>
</ul>

This theory
seems to be ruined by the presence of a nonzero cosmological constant
and the resulting nonzero lower bound on the temperature.
