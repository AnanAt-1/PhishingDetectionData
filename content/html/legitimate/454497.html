The ice in the core of pingos usually originates from segregation or injection of fluid water, and can be massive. Tension fractures are normal for the mound's summit, but pingo ice expansion is brief and rare. A small freshwater lake can occupy the summit where a crater has formed from the ice melting.<br />
<br />
Pingos are generally classified as hydrostatic&nbsp;(closed-system) or hydraulic (open-system).  Relict hydrostatic (closed-system) and hydraulic (open-system) pingos may be distinguished from each other by determining if lacustrine (lake) deposits are associated with the formation.<br />

Evidence of collapsed pingos in an area suggests that there was once permafrost.<br />
<br />
Pingos usually grow only a couple centimetres per year, with Ibyuk Pingo growing at a rate of 2 centimetre (0.78740157480315 in) a year, and the largest take decades or even centuries to form.

<br />
Hydrostatic (closed-system) pingos form as a result of hydrostatic pressure&nbsp;on water from permafrost, and commonly form in drained lakes or river channels. Permafrost rises to the drained body's former floor. Pore water is expelled in front of the rising permafrost, and the resulting pressure causes the frozen ground to rise and an ice core to form. The shape and size of a hydrostatic or closed system pingo is often similar to the body of water that it originated from. They can vary from symmetrical conical domes to asymmetric, elongate hills.<br />
<br />
Hydraulic (open-system) pingos result from groundwater flowing from an outside source, i.e. subpermafrost or intrapermafrost <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("70540",this,"aquifer.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("70540")' href="/topics/Aquifer">aquifer</a><span class="hp" id="m70540"><div class="hpHeader">Aquifer</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i70540"></div>An aquifer is a wet underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials  from which groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well.

Hydrostatic pressure initializes the formation of the ice core as water is pushed up and subsequently freezes. Open-system pingos have no limitations to the amount of water available unless the aquifers freeze. They often occur at the base of slopes and are commonly known as Greenland type.

These pingos are often oval or oblong shaped. It is still not entirely understood why open system or hydraulic pingos normally occur in unglaciated terrain.<br />
