CHAPTER  XXVI. 

NEW  BRUNSWICK— Concluded. 

The  New  Brunswick  of  the  present  day  is  preeminently  one  of  the 
enterprising  and  progressive  cities  of  the  State.  The  markets  of  the 
world  are  open  to  her  commercial  interests  and  manufacturing  indus- 
tries, located  as  she  is  in  direct  communication  and  connection  with  the 
two  populous  seaports  of  the  eastern  portion  of  the  Nation.  The  traveler 
from  the  East,  reclining  in  his  comfortable  seat  in  a  Pullman  of  today, 
as  he  approaches  the  east  bank  of  the  Raritan  river,  sees  spread  before 
him  the  smoke  rising  towards  the  heavens  from  the  large  brick  chimneys 
of  her  thriving  manufactories,  and  in  the  distance  the  campus  and  classic 
college  buildings.  In  his  overhead  passage,  the  highways  and  byways 
of  the  city  attract  his  attention,  glimpses  are  caught  of  twirling  trolley 
cars,  and  a  busy  class  of  people  engaged  in  the  various  vocations  of  life. 
If  he  is  a  student  of  history,  he  cannot  fail  to  call  to  his  mind  the 
description  of  Kalm,  the  great  Swedish  traveler,  and  the  autocratic 
New  Englander,  the  second  President  of  the  United  States,  who  in 
voluminous  notes  more  than  a  century  and  a  half  ago  recorded  their 
impressions  of  New  Brunswick,  then  in  her  infancy. 

In  closing  the  history  of  the  city  we  append  mention  of  some  of  her 
native  born  sons  and  residents  who  in  their  chosen  professions  have 
gained  not  only  a  local  but  a  national  reputation. 

A  naval  career  appealed  to  Charles  Stuart  Boggs.  His  mother  was 
a  sister  of  Captain  James  Lawrence,  who  is  notable  in  American  history 
as  the  commander  of  the  "Chesapeake,"  and  who,  when  mortally 
wounded  in  the  engagement  with  the  British  frigate  "Shannon,"  gave 
the  famous  command,  "Don't  give  up  the  ship."  The  future  rear- 
admiral  of  the  United  States  was  born  at  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey, 
January  28,  181 1.  When  quite  young  he  became  a  cadet  at  Captain 
Patridge's  celebrated  military  academy  at  Middletown,  Connecticut. 
But  the  navy  was  his  chosen  profession,  and  on  November  26,  1826,  he 
received  the  appointment  of  midshipman  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey 
and  was  ordered  to  the  Mediterranean  squadron,  which  was  engaged  in 
protecting  American  commerce  from  Greek  pirates.  Here  three  years 
were  passed,  the  next  two  years  being  spent  with  the  West  India 
squadron.  Having  been  appointed  passed-midshipman,  he  was  for  four 
years,  one  year  excepted,  on  land  service  on  board  a  receiving  ship  at 
New  York.  He  joined  the  ship-of-the-line  "North  Carolina"  in  1836 
as  master,  and  on  September  6,  1837,  was  appointed  lieutenant.  He 
returned  to  this  country  in  1839,  when  the  "North  Carolina"  was  made 
a  school  ship  in  New  York  harbor.     As  lieutenant  in  charge  of  the 


348  MIDDLESEX 

apprentices,  Lieutenant  Boggs  displayed  his  fine  capacity  for  command, 
combining  mildness  and  courtesy  of  manner  with  absolute  strictness  in 
the  enforcement  of  discipline.  The  decade  between  1840  and  1850  was 
spent  by  Lieutenant  Boggs  on  the  sloop  "Saratoga,"  on  the  coast  of 
Africa,  bombarding  and  destroying  slave  ports.  Later,  on  the  steamer 
"Princeton,"  in  the  Mexican  War,  he  took  part  in  the  bombardment  of 
San  Juan  de  Ulloa  and  Tampico.  With  a  boat  crew  he  successfully 
destroyed  the  U.  S.  brig  "Truxton,"  which  had  surrendered  to  the 
Mexicans;  this  was  a  mission  requiring  tact  and  courage  on  the  part 
of  the  commander  to  prevent  the  capture  of  the  attacking  party.  The 
"Princeton"  was  ordered  to  the  Mediterranean,  and  was  the  first  pro- 
peller to  navigate  those  waters.  Lieutenant  Boggs,  as  executive  officer 
of  the  frigate  "St.  Lawrence,"  carried  the  American  contributions  to  the 
World's  Fair  held  in  London,  England,  in  1851.  His  next  assignment 
was  as  inspector  of  clothing  and  provisions  at  the  New  York  Navy 
Yard.  Here  he  remained  until  1854,  and  the  following  year  was  placed 
in  command  of  the  mail  steamer  "Illinois,"  in  the  service  of  the  Califor- 
nia Steamship  Company. 

At  the  outbreak  of  the  War  of  the  Rebellion  he  requested  to  be 
placed  in  active  service,  and  was  given  command  of  the  "Varuna," 
which  was  ordered  to  join  Farragut's  fleet  below  New  Orleans.  The 
"Varuna"  was  the  first  ship  to  force  its  way  past  the  rebel  batteries, 
but  was  demolished  by  the  ironclad  "Stonewall  Jackson."  Following 
the  notable  command  of  his  famous  uncle,  Boggs  ran  the  "Varuna" 
ashore,  firing  her  guns  until  they  were  under  water.  For  his  gallantry 
in  this  unparalleled  naval  combat,  his  native  city  and  State  each  pre- 
sented him  with  a  sword. 

Having  been  commissioned  a  captain  July  16,  1862,  he  was  placed 
in  command  of  the  "Sacramento,"  of  the  blockading  squadron  off  Cape 
Fear  river.  Here  his  health  failed  him  and  he  was  obliged  to  resign. 
During  the  last  years  of  the  war,  he  was  on  shore  duty  at  New  York, 
engaged  in  superintending  the  building  and  fitting  out  of  a  fleet  of 
steam  picket-boats  planned  by  himself.  One  of  these  was  the  torpedo- 
boat  with  which  Lieutenant  Cushing  sank  the  Confederate  ram  "Albe- 
marle." After  the  close  of  the  war.  Captain  Boggs  cruised  in  the  West 
Indies,  attached  to  the  North  Atlantic  squadron.  He  was  promoted  to 
the  rank  of  rear-admiral  July  i,  1870,  and  g^ven  duty  as  lighthouse 
inspector  of  the  Third  District.  He  was  placed  on  the  retired  list  in 
1873,  and  died  April  22,  1888. 

A  resident  of  New  Brunswick  for  nearly  thirty  years  was  Theodore 
Sanford  Doolittle.  His  boyhood  days  were  spent  in  his  native  town  of 
Ovid,  Seneca  county.  New  York,  where  he  was  born  November  30, 
1834.  He  became  a  student  at  Rutgers  College  in  1855,  was  one  of  the 
editors  of  the  "Rutgers  Quarterly,"  and  in  his  senior  year  gained  the 


CITY  OF  NEW  BRUNSWICK  349 

Suydam  prize  for  the  best  English  composition.  As  a  collegian,  he 
familiarized  himself  with  the  works  of  essayists,  historians,  and  poets, 
was  a  proficient  student  in  the  classics,  and  became  especially  versed 
in  the  German  language.  His  mastery  of  this  language  enabled  him  to 
preach  to  German  speaking  congregations.  Dr.  Doolittle  entered  the 
Theological  Seminary  at  New  Brunswick  in  1861,  and  after  his  gradua- 
tion became  pastor  of  a  church  at  Flatlands,  Long  Island.  His  pastorate 
was  of  short  duration,  as  in  1864  he  accepted  the  chair  of  rhetoric,  logic 
and  metaphysics  in  Rutgers  College.  He  remained  a  member  of  the 
faculty  of  the  college  during  his  life,  was  elected  vice-president  in  1891, 
and  from  August,  1890,  to  February,  1891,  acted  as  president.  He  was 
a  contributor  to  magazines,  reviewer  of  important  works,  a  keen  critic, 
and  a  brilliant  writer.  An  extensive  traveler,  he  twice  visited  Europe, 
and  also  toured  the  Bahamas,  Canada,  and  the  Pacific  coast.  He  died  at 
New  Brunswick,  April  18,  1893. 

For  nearly  a  score  of  years  president  of  Rutgers  College,  the  Rev. 
William  Henry  Campbell  was  a  familiar  figure  to  the  citizens  of  New 
Brunswick.  He  was  born  in  Baltimore,  Maryland,  September  14,  1808, 
a  son  of  a  merchant  of  that  city.  Young  Campbell  became  a  student  at 
Dickinson  College  at  the  age  of  sixteen ;  after  his  graduation  a  year  was 
spent  at  the  Theological  Seminary  at  Princeton.  Mr.  Campbell's  first 
settlement  was  as  assistant  to  the  Rev.  Dr.  Andrew  Yates,  at  Chit- 
tenango.  New  York.  This  pastorate  included  a  large  number  of  depen- 
dent churches,  and  in  the  performance  of  his  duties  Mr.  Campbell  con- 
tracted a  throat  malady  that  interrupted  his  career  as  a  preacher,  and 
from  1834  to  1839  he  became  principal  of  Erasmus  Hall,  Brooklyn, 
New  York.  During  the  next  decade  he  established  a  church  in  East 
New  York,  and  was  pastor  of  the  Third  Reformed  Church  at  Albany, 
New  York.  Returning  to  educational  pursuits  in  1848,  he  accepted 
the  principalship  of  the  Albany  Academy,  and  three  years  later  was 
called  to  the  professorship  of  Oriental  literature  in  the  Theological 
Seminary  at  New  Brunswick.  Here  he  also  occupied  the  chair  of 
belles-lettres  under  the  trustees  of  Rutgers  College  for  twelve  years.  On 
the  death  of  Dr.  Frelinghuysen,  in  1862,  after  much  persuasion  on  the 
part  of  the  trustees.  Dr.  Campbell  consented  to  become  his  successor 
as  president  of  the  college,  and  entered  with  exceptional  enthusiasm 
and  ability  into  the  work  both  of  teaching  and  securing  a  large  endow- 
ment fund  for  the  institution.  During  his  administration  over  $300,000 
was  raised,  six  new  professorships  were  established,  the  number  of 
students  was  doubled,  a  large  geological  hall  was  erected,  also  a  beauti- 
ful chapel  and  library  under  one  roof ;  an  astronomical  observatory  was 
erected  and  thoroughly  equipped;  an  addition  made  to  the  grammar 
school,  doubling  its  accommodations ;  and  useful  buildings  were  erected 
on  the  experimental  farm.    At  the  age  of  seventy-three  years.  Dr.  Camp-

bell  resigned  the  presidency  of  the  college,  and  a  new  professorship  was 
created,  "The  Chair  of  Evidences  of  Christianity,"  his  services  being 
thus  retained  by  the  college  until  his  death,  September  7,  1890.  Of  his 
twenty  years'  service  as  president,  the  inscription  on  Sir  Christophec 
Wren's  tomb  in  St.  Paul's  Cathedral,  London,  may  stand  for  the  whole 
story :  Sirequiris  monumentum  circumspice. 

In  the  Navy  of  the  United  States,  another  son  of  New  Brunswick 
was,  in  the  opinion  of  Attorney-General  Jeremiah  S.  Black,  the  victim 
of  more  governmental  blunders  than  any  one  man  in  the  history  of 
the  American  Navy.  Philip  Falkerson  Voorhees  was  born  in  New 
Brunswick  in  1792.  He  entered  the  navy  as  midshipman,  November 
15,  1809,  and  was  engaged  in  the  second  war  with  Great  Britain,  taking 
part  in  the  capture  of  the  "Macedonian"  by  the  "United  States,"  and 
of  the  "Epervier"  by  the  "Peacock,"  for  which  he  received  a  medal 
from  Congress.  He  was  promoted  to  commander  April  24,  1828,  and 
to  captain  February  28,  1838,  and  three  years  later  was  assigned  to 
the  frigate  "Congress"  on  her  first  cruise.  He  assisted  in  rescuing  the 
stranded  British  ship  "Gorgon"  in  the  La  Plata  river,  and  in  1844 
captured  an  armed  Argentine  squadron  and  allied  cruiser  which  had  fired 
into  his  convoy,  a  Boston  bark,  on  which  some  fishermen  chased  by  the 
cruiser  had  taken  refuge.  Captain  Voorhees  released  the  squadron, 
but  detained  the  cruiser,  which  had  aggravated  the  assault  by  firing 
from  under  a  false  flag.  The  cruiser  was  subsequently  released,  but 
Captain  Voorhees'  action  was  justified,  and  he  was  highly  praised  by 
the  United  States  diplomatic  and  consular  representatives  and  foreign 
naval  officers  in  South  America.  Yet  this  capture  was  made  the  occa- 
sion for  a  series  of  charges  on  which  he  was  tried  by  court-martial.  The 
sentence  of  the  court  was  not  approved  by  President  Polk,  who  restored 
Captain  Voorhees  to  his  full  rank  and  gave  him  the  command  of  the 
East  India  squadron,  and  the  proceedings  of  the  court-martial  were  by 
the  attorney-general  declared  null  and  void.  Returning  to  this  country 
in  185 1  on  his  flag-ship  "Plymouth,"  he  was  placed  four  years  later  on 
the  reserved  list;  this  he  deemed  an  injustice,  and  he  appealed  to  Con- 
gress for  reinstatement,  but  a  court  of  inquiry  reaffirmed  the  decision. 
A  second  appeal  was  made  to  President  Buchanan,  who  referred  the 
whole  matter  to  Attorney-General  Jeremiah  S.  Black,  whose  opinion  is 
stated  at  the  commencement  of  this  paragraph.  Having  been  restored 
to  the  leave  pay-list,  at  the  opening  of  the  Civil  War  Captain  Voorhees 
urged  his  assignment  to  active  duty,  but  his  death  took  place  at 
Annapolis,  Maryland,  February  26,  1862. 

The  Terhune  family  was  of  Huguenot  origin,  as  early  as  1651  the 
emigrant  ancestor,  Albert  Terhune,  settling  at  Gravesend,  Long  Island. 
A  descendant  of  this  emigrant,  John  Stafford  Terhune,  served  with  the 
New  Jersey  troops    during  the  Revolution.     His    son    John,   born    at 


CITY  OF  NEW  BRUNSWICK  351 

Blawenburg,  Somerset  county,  New  Jersey,  May  4,  1793,  became  a 
resident  of  New  Brunswick  in  1812.  He  engaged  in  the  trade  of  printer 
and  bookbinder,  and  also  became  a  publisher  and  stationer,  which 
business  he  conducted  until  his  death,  January  9,  1886.  He  was  printer 
of  the  celebrated  Webster's  "Elementary  Spelling  Book,"  and  was  the 
father  of  Rev.  Edward  Payson  Terhune,  the  noted  divine,  whose  wife 
was  well  known  to  the  literary  world  under  the  nom-de  plume  of 
Marion  Harland.  A  son  by  this  marriage  was  Albert  Payson  Terhune, 
whose  short  stories  and  novelettes,  besides  miscellaneous  articles,  have 
appeared  in  popular  magazines  of  the  present  day. 

In  the  world  of  arts  and  sciences.  New  Brunswick's  claim  to  recogni- 
tion is  that  it  was  the  birthplace  of  Johnson  Marchant  Mundy,  the 
sculptor.  His  paternal  ancestor,  Nicholas  Mundy,  emigrated  from 
England  in  1680  and  settled  in  Middlesex  county.  The  sculptor  was 
the  son  of  Frederick  and  Mary  (Marchant)  Mundy,  and  was  born  at 
New  Brunswick,  May  13,  1832.  When  Johnson  was  only  three  years 
of  age,  his  parents  removed  to  Geneva,  New  York,  and  with  the  western 
part  of  that  State  the  family  were  ever  afterwards  identified.  The  boy 
was  educated,  making  rapid  progress  with  his  studies,  particularly  in 
the  languages,  and  early  displayed  remarkable  taste  for  art,  especially 
in  drawing,  carving,  and  the  study  of  music.  His  school  studies,  how- 
ever, terminated  when  he  was  fourteen  years  of  age  on  account  of  a 
disease  of  the  eyes;  though  his  sight  was  not  impaired  in  the  daytime, 
he  was  subject  to  what  was  called  "night-blindness."  A  maternal  uncle 
was  a  distinguished  surgeon  in  North  Carolina,  and  young  Mundy  was 
sent  in  1847  to  him  for  treatment,  but,  receiving  no  benefit,  he  returned 
North  and  was  placed  under  charge  of  different  medical  men  in  Phila- 
delphia and  New  York. 

A  sea  voyage  was  undertaken  in  the  summer  of  1849  to  t^^  Azores, 
and  he  lived  several  months  at  Fayal.  He  became  skilled  in  cameo  and 
ivory  carving.  In  1851-52  he  determined  to  study  sculpture,  and  accord- 
ingly went  to  New  York  City,  procuring  employment  in  a  marble  yard. 
From  this  primary  practice  he  went  to  the  studio  of  J.  K.  Brown  in 
Brooklyn,  New  York,  and  began  modeling  in  clay,  at  the  same  time 
giving  attention  to  drawing.  Here  he  remained  eight  years,  acquiring 
the  art  of  the  bronze-worker  and  the  principles  and  processes  of  sculp- 
ture. He  also  familiarized  himself  with  anatomy,  and  modeled  a  number 
of  busts.  During  this  period  his  financial  resources  became  exhausted, 
and  he  was  obliged  to  depend  on  his  art  to  enable  him  to  carry  on  his 
studies,  and  accordingly  made  portraits  and  drawings  from  the  antique, 
which  he  sold.  After  spending  two  years  at  Watertown,  New  York, 
he  settled  in  1863  in  Rochester,  New  York,  where  he  opened  a  studio. 
He  was  first  known  as  a  crayon  artist,  working  also  in  pastels,  and 
made  a  large  number  of  medallion  portraits  and  portrait  busts  of  promi- 


352  MIDDLESEX 

nent  people  in  Rochester  and  its  neighborhood ;  he  executed  also  several 
ideal  heads. 

The  disease  of  his  eyes  had  been  steadily  developing;  in  1879-80 
he  was  obliged  to  abandon  his  art  work;  his  condition  improving,  he 
opened  the  Rochester  Art  School,  where  he  taught  drawing  and  model- 
ing. His  power  of  vision  was  extremely  limited  and  feeble,  and  most 
of  his  work  had  to  be  accomplished  by  the  sense  of  touch.  It  was  in 
this  condition  that  he  performed  his  two  masterpieces, — the  Soldiers' 
Monument  in  Sleepy  Hollow  Cemetery  at  Tarrytown-on-Hudson,  which 
represents  a  vidette  in  the  volunteer  service,  and  is  adjudged  as  the 
most  graceful  and  spirited  statue  of  a  soldier  in  the  country;  the  other 
heroic  statue  was  that  of  Washington  Irving,  the  work  upon  which 
proved  a  severe  strain  upon  the  artist's  nerves,  and  marked  diminution 
of  sight.  Materials  for  the  statue  were  gathered  and  compared  and 
studied  by  the  aid  of  magnifying  glasses.  After  eighteen  months  of 
arduous  labor,  in  which  the  actual  work  was  performed  by  the  sense 
of  touch,  the  statue  was  completed  and  received  encomiums  from  all 
visitors.  The  statue  was  intended  for  a  bronze  casting  to  be  placed 
on  a  granite  pedestal  in  an  open  air  location.  The  gifted  author  is 
represented  sitting  in  an  appropriate  armchair,  in  his  habitual  easy 
manner  while  in  conversation,  the  body  well  settled  in  an  ample  cushion, 
the  limbs  crossed  in  a  natural  and  easy  manner,  the  arms  rest  upon 
those  of  the  chair,  the  head  is  slightly  inclined  to  one  side,  and  the 
countenance  is  illumined  by  a  most  genial  and  tender  feeling.  As  a 
whole,  the  figure  is  marked  by  a  natural  and  easy  posturing,  and  pre- 
sents that  happy  combination  of  qualities  so  characteristic  of  Mr.  Irving 
— modesty,  dignity,  and  benevolence.  Among  Mr.  Mundy's  other  works 
mention  might  be  made  of  the  statuettes  of  "The  Reaper,"  '"  The  Pilgrim" 
and  "Columbia."  His  life  came  to  a  peaceful  close  at  Geneva.  New  York, 
August  16,  1897. 

A  familiar  figure  in  the  streets  of  New  Brunswick  in  the  middle  of 
the  past  century,  was  Gustavius  Fischer,  a  member  of  the  faculty  of 
Rutgers  College.  He  was  born  at  Berlin,  Germany,  in  June.  1815,  re- 
ceiving his  education  at  the  Universities*  of  Berlin  and  Gottingen,  and 
making  a  specialty  of  the  study  of  law,  philology  and  music.  Becoming 
involved  in  the  revolution  that  swept  over  Germany  in  1848,  he  became 
a  member  of  Parliament,  and  on  the  overthrow  of  that  rump  body  he 
fled  to  Switzerland  and  from  thence  came  to  America  in  1S50.  He 
became  professor  of  modern  languages  at  Rutgers  College  in  1858,  and 
also  taught  French  and  German  in  a  private  seminary  for  young  ladies 
in  New  Brunswick.  He  held  his  chair  in  the  college  until  1869,  when 
he  resigned,  spending  the  remainder  of  his  life  in  musical  study.  He 
ended  an  eventful  life  at  New  Brunswick,  September  16,  1893. 

One  of  the  noted  benefactors  and  philanthropists  of  New  Brunswick 


CITY  OF  NEW  BRUNSWICK  353 

was  Simon  Van  Wickle.  A  native  of  Middlesex  county,  he  was  born 
at  Jamesburg  in  March,  1820.  After  attaining  his  majority,  he  removed 
to  New  Brunswick,  where  he  became  a  marine  captain,  obtaining  wide 
notoriety  as  the  commander  of  the  steamer  "Antelope,"  which  operated 
in  opposition  to  Commodore  Vanderbilt's  boats.  He  afterwards  engaged 
in  the  coal  business  and  became  interested  in  the  firm  of  Van  Wickle 
&amp;  Stout,  of  New  York  City.  A  prominent  member  of  the  Baptist 
church,  he  held  official  positions  in  the  New  Jersey  Central  Baptist 
Association  and  the  State  Baptist  Convention.  He  was  also  a  member 
of  the  board  of  managers  of  the  Peddie  Institute.  To  this  institution 
he  gave  $15,000;  he  also  erected  a  church  in  New  Brunswick  for  the 
colored  Baptists,  and  gave  various  sums  to  struggling  congregations  of 
that  denomination  throughout  the  State,  his  gifts  aggregating  more 
than  $100,000.    His  death  occurred  at  New  Brunswick,  May  15,  1888. 

Two  sons  of  James  and  Mary  Faugeres  (Ellis)  Bishop,  both  natives 
of  New  Brunswick,  gained  a  wide  reputation  in  their  chosen  profession. 
The  eldest,  James  Remsen  Bishop,  born  September  17,  i860,  prepared 
for  college  in  the  schools  of  Germany  and  at  the  famous  St.  Paul's 
School  at  Concord,  New  Hampshire,  where  having  received  the  highest 
honors,  he  entered  in  1880  the  sophomore  class  of  Yale  University. 
Throughout  his  collegiate  course  he  was  distinguished  for  proficiency 
in  the  classics,  also  for  skill  in  athletic  sports.  Leaving  Yale  in  1881 
he  was,  in  consequence  of  the  favorable  reports  of  his  instructors, 
admitted  to  the  senior  class  of  Harvard  College.  Here  he  devoted  him- 
self almost  exclusively  to  classic  philology  based  upon  the  study  of 
Sanscrit.  After  graduation  at  Harvard,  for  a  year  he  taught  Greek  and 
English  at  his  old  school  in  Concord,  New  Hampshire.  President  Mc- 
Cosh,  of  Princeton  University,  invited  him  to  the  difficult  task  of  building 
up  the  decayed  preparatory  school  founded  by  Henry  E.  Marquard,  as 
a  feeder  to  the  University.  Mr.  Bishop  possessed  novel  methods  of 
school  government  and  instruction,  in  which  he  advocated  the  cultiva- 
tion of  self-activity  in  the  moral  and  mental  nature  of  the  young  as  the 
chief  end  of  education.  Adopting  this  principle,  he  succeeded  in  arousing 
a  rare  enthusiasm  in  the  boys  of  the  school,  and  in  1887,  the  future  of 
the  Princeton  Preparatory  School,  having  been  assured  and  the  prac- 
ticability of  his  educational  ideas  established,  Mr.  Bishop  removed  to 
Cincinnati,  Ohio,  to  accept  a  position  in  the  Hughes  High  School  in 
that  city.  He  was  connected  with  educational  institutions  in  Cincinnati 
until  1904,  when  he  removed  to  Detroit,  Michigan,  to  take  charge  of 
the  Eastern  High  School,  in  which  labors  he  was  engaged  at  the  time 
of  his  death.  A  younger  brother,  Louis  Faugeres  Bishop,  born  March 
14,  1864.  after  graduating  from  Rutgers  College  and  the  College  of  Phy- 
sicians and  Surgeons  of  Columbia  College,  became  resident  physician  of 
St.  Luke's  Hospital,  New  York  City,  and  professor  of  diseases  of  the 

Mid-23

heart  and  circulation  at  Fordham  University  Medical  School.  He  is 
also  a  member  of  the  medical  staffs  of  Lincoln  Hospital,  and  Mercy- 
Hospital  at  Hempstead,  Long  Island.  Dr.  Bishop  was  secretary  of  the 
New  York  Academy  of  Medicine  from  1889  to  1892,  and  is  engaged 
in  the  practice  of  his  chosen  profession  in  New  York  City. 

Thomas  Hill,  the  twenty-first  president  of  Harvard  College,  was 
born  at  New  Brunswick,  January  6,  1818,  the  son  of  Thomas  Hill,  a 
Unitarian  in  religious  belief,  who  left  his  native  country  of  England 
to  enjoy  a  larger  freedom  of  thought,  speech  and  action  in  America. 
The  future  president  of  Harvard  College  was  left  an  orphan  at  an 
early  age,  and  was  educated  by  his  sisters.  When  old  enough  to  be 
placed  at  work  he  was  apprenticed  to  a  printer,,  and  on  completing  his 
term  of  apprenticeship  in  1833  he  attended  school  at  the  Lower  Dublin 
Academy,  near  Philadelphia,  of  which  his  oldest  brother  was  principal. 
After  a  year  at  this  school,  he  was  apprenticed  to  an  apothecary  in 
New  Brunswick.  He  commenced  his  preparation  for  college  in  1838, 
and  in  August  of  the  following  year  was  matriculated  at  Harvard  Col- 
lege for  the  class  of  1843.  After  his  graduation,  high  standing  in 
mathematics  and  physical  science  secured  him  the  offer  of  a  position 
in  the  National  Observatory  in  Washington,  but  he  could  not  be  dis- 
suaded from  studying  the  ministry.  He  attended  the  Divinity  School, 
graduated  in  1845,  and  was  for  fourteen  years  settled  as  minister  of 
the  Unitarian  church  at  Waltham,  Massachusetts.  In  1859  he  suc- 
ceeded Horace  Mann  as  president  of  Antioch  College,  of  Yellow  Springs, 
Ohio,  and  during  his  incumbency  of  this  office  served  as  pastor  of  the 
Church  of  the  Redeemer  at  Cincinnati.  He  resigned  from  the  presidency 
of  Antioch  College  in  1862,  and  the  same  year  succeeded  President 
Cornelius  Conway  Felton  as  president  of  Harvard  College.  The  faculty 
welcomed  his  presidency,  as  he  had  their  entire  respect  and  confidence, 
and  the  science  teachers  recognized  in  him  their  rightful  head.  The 
academic  council  was  started  at  his  suggestion,  and  the  university 
lectures  were  first  opened  to  the  public.  He  held  the  office  until  1868, 
when  he  was  compelled  by  ill  health  and  domestic  afflictions  to  resign, 
and  was  succeeded  by  Charles  William  Eliot.  He  had  married  a  niece 
of  an  eminent  Unitarian  minister. 

After  his  retirement  from  the  presidency,  he  returned  to  Waltham, 
Massachusetts,  and  later  accompanied  Professor  Louis  Agassiz  to  South 
America  on  his  well  known  epedition.  Upon  his  return  he  accepted 
the  pastorate  of  the  First  Parish  Church  of  Portland,  Maine.  He  was 
devoted  to  the  study  of  mathematical  problems,  became  a  foremost 
investigator  in  natural  science,  an  accomplished  classical  scholar,  and 
was  especially  conversant  with  Hebrew  and  cognate  Oriental  languages. 
He  made  in  May,  1891,  his  annual  visit  to  the  Divinity  School  at  Mead- 
ville,  Pennsylvania,  to  deliver  a  course  of  lectures  before  the  students. 


CITY  OF  NEW  BRUNSWICK  355 

and  upon  his  return  homeward,  while  at  his  daughter's  home  in  Wal- 
tham,  Massachusetts,  died  on  November  21,  1891. 

Among  those  whose  inventive  brains  have  aided  in  the  safety  of 
ocean  travel  may  be  numbered  Lawrence  Fisher  Frazee,  born  in  New 
Brunswick,  May  22,  1813.  In  his  early  life  he  was  apprenticed  to  learn 
the  jewelry  trade,  and  finally  carried  on  that  business  in  his  native 
city.  At  the  time  of  the  great  tornado  of  June  19,  1835,  his  store  was 
completely  demolished,  which  ruined  him  financially.  He  then  entered 
the  employ  of  the  New  Brunswick  Steamboat  and  Transportation  Com- 
pany, remaining  with  its  successors,  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  Railroad 
and  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad,  until  his  death,  except  during  the 
period  of  the  Civil  War,  when  he  commanded  the  government  trans- 
port "Massachusetts,"  which  ran  between  Fortress  Monroe  and  points 
on  the  James  river.  During  his  marine  career,  he  invented  and  per- 
fected appliances  of  much  value,  including  a  stern  paddle-wheel  for 
canal  boats,  a  life-boat,  a  life-raft,  that  was  adopted  by  the  United 
States  government;  a  safety  gang  plank,  the  life  boat  davits  used  on 
ocean  steamers  and  ferryboats,  and  the  safety  gates  on  the  latter.  He 
died  at  New  Brunswick,  October  10,  1896. 

In  the  banking  circles  of  New  Jersey  in  the  latter  part  of  the  past 
century  there  were  two  sons  of  New  Brunswick  who  gained  prominence 
in  the  financial  interests  of  neighboring  cities.  Augustus  A.  Harden- 
bergh  was  a  son  of  Cornelius  L.  Hardenbergh,  one  of  the  most  eminent 
members  of  the  bar  of  the  State,  a  grandson  of  Rev.  John  R.  Harden- 
bergh, the  founder  of  Queen's  College,  afterwards  Rutgers  College,  and 
its  first  president.  The  younger  Hardenbergh  was  born  in  New 
Brunswick,  May  18,  1830,  and  became  a  student  at  Rutgers  College  in 
1844.  He,  however,  was  obliged  to  relinquish  his  studies  before  the  end 
of  the  course  on  account  of  the  sudden  blindness  of  his  father,  to  act 
as  his  amanuensis.  His  banking  career  commenced  in  1846,  when  he 
became  connected  with  a  banking  firm  in  New  York  City,  and  from 
this  time  he  became  a  resident  of  Jersey  City.  He  became  connected 
in  1852  with  the  Hudson  County  Bank  in  that  city  in  the  capacity  of 
a  teller,  and  four  years  later  was  made  cashier.  Being  an  eloquent 
.speaker,  he  soon  attracted  political  attention,  and  although  a  Democrat, 
he  was  elected  in  a  strong  Whig  district  in  1853  to  the  State  Legisla- 
ture, and  though  the  youngest  member  of  that  body,  he  became  one 
of  the  most  prominent  by  his  services  in  securing  the  passage  of  the 
General  Banking  Act,  and  in  opposition  to  granting  further  powers 
to  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  Railroad  Company,  which  at  that  time  was 
a  gigantic  monopoly.  He  was  nominated  in  1874,  without  solicitation 
on  his  part,  for  the  Forty-fourth  Congress,  and  was  elected  by  a  large 
majority.  He  was  reelected  in  1876,  but  having  been  elected  president 
of  the  Hudson  County  National  Bank  in  1878,  he  declined  to  serve.    Two 


356  MIDDLESEX 

years  later,  on  the  imperative  demand  of  the  leaders  of  his  party,  he 
again  became  a  candidate  and  was  elected  to  the  Forty-seventh  Con- 
gress, five  thousand  majority.  During  his  first  term  of  Congress  he 
was  a  member  of  the  military,  centennial  and  District  of  Columbia 
committees,  and  during  his  second  and  third  terms  he  was  on  the 
banking  and  currency  committee.  Mr.  Hardenbergh's  six  years  of 
congressional  life  were  full  of  activity  and  energy;  he  discharged  his 
duties  with  all  the  thoroughness  and  fidelity  which  characterized  his 
action  in  his  private  business,  and  during  his  term  of  service  he  did 
not  miss  a  single  vote  in  the  House  of  Representatives.  His  death 
occurred  at  Jersey  City,  October  3,  1889. 

The  active  career  of  Edward  Stelle  Campbell  was  distinguished  by 
exceptional  business  ability  and  sagacity.  He  was  born  in  New  Bruns- 
wick, January  8,  1854.  He  attended  the  public  schools  of  that  city, 
graduating  in  1868,  and  two  years  later  found  employment  in  the 
National  Bank  of  New  Jersey,  where  he  spent  fourteen  years,  during 
ten  of  which  he  was  cashier.  In  January,  1894,  he  became  vice-president 
of  the  National  Newark  Banking  Company,  the  oldest  banking  organiza- 
tion in  the  State,  and  on  its  merging  with  the  Newark  City  National 
Bank  in  1902,  when  the  capital  stock  was  made  $1,000,000,  Mr.  Campbell 
became  president,  which  position  he-  held  at  the  time  of  his  death  at 
Lake  George,  New  York,  July  2,  1905. 

In  the  army  circles  of  the  present  day,  New  Brunswick  is  represented 
by  William  Weigel,  who  was  born  in  the  city,  August  25,  1863,  a  son 
or  Philip  and  Anna  (Slizer)  Weigel.  A  graduate  of  West  Point  in  1887, 
his  first  military  duties  were  in  Indian  warfare  in  the  West.  At  the 
breaking  out  of  the  Spanish-American  War  he  was  assistant  to  the 
chief-quartermaster  of  the  Division  of  Cuba.  He  was  transferred  in 
1901  and  became  chief-quartermaster  in  the  Philippine  Islands  and 
participated  in  the  campaign  against  the  Ladrones.  In  the  insurrection 
in  the  Island  of  Samar,  he  held  Samar  with  forty-eight  men  for  sixteen 
days  against  the  insurgents.  He  returned  to  the  Uunited  States  in  1903, 
but  was  again  assigned  for  duty  in  the  Philippines  from  1907  to  1909. 
General  Weigel  was  on  duty  on  the  Mexican  border  in  1913  and  1914. 
At  the  time  of  the  entrance  of  the  United  States  in  the  World's  War, 
after  serving  as  commander  of  the  Seventy-sixth  Division  and  Canton- 
ment at  Camp  Devens,  Ayer,  Massachusetts,  he  sailed  for  France,  and 
from  May  5,  1918,  to  the  demobilization,  June  14,  1919,  for  the  greater 
part  of  the  time  was  commander  of  the  Eighty-eighth  division.  He 
participated  in  the  Champagne-Marne  defensive,  the  Aisne-Marne 
offensive,  Oise-Aisne  offensive,  and  the  Meuse-Argonne  offensive.  He 
was  awarded  two  croix-de-guerre  by  France,  was  made  a  commander 
in  the  Legion  of  Honor,  and  "for  exceptionally  meritorious  and  distin- 
guished services"  was  awarded  the  Distinguished  Service  Medal.

Brigadier-General  Joseph  C.  Castner,  who  commanded  the  Ninth 
Infantry  Brigade  in  all  its  operations  as  a  part  of  the  Fifth  Division, 
American  Expeditionary  Forces,  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  New 
Jersey,  November  18,  1869,  son  of  Cornelius  W.  Castner,  who  was 
captain  of  one  of  New  Brunswick's  first  companies  in  'the  Civil  War. 
Joseph  C.  Castner  in  1891  was  graduated  from  Rutgers  College  with  the 
degree  of  Civil  Engineer.  On  August  i,  1891,  he  was  commissioned 
second  lieutenant  in  the  United  States  Army  and  assigned  to  the  Fourth 
Infantry  for  duty.  He  has  since  been  promoted  as  follows:  First  lieu- 
tenant, Fourth  Infantry,  April  28,  1898;  captain,  Squadron  Philippine 
Cavalry,  April  23,  1900;  captain.  Fourth  Infantry,  February  2,  1901 ; 
major.  Twenty-first  Infantry,  August  27,  191 3;  lieutenant-colonel.  Sixth

brigadier-general.  Ninth  Brigade,  April  12,  1918.  He  attended  the 
Infantry  and  Cavalry  School  in  1895,  and  was  in  the  War  College  in

Prior  to  the  World  War,  General  Castner  had  already  distinguished 

himself.  While  a  lieutenant  he  rendered  great  service  to  the  American 
government  as  an  explorer  in  Alaska.  In  the  Philippines,  for  his  serv- 
ices with  the  Tagalog  scouts,  he  was  promoted  to  a  captaincy  in  the 
Philippine  squadron  of  cavalry,  which  commission  he  held  until  receiving 
a  captaincy  in  the  regular  army.  Later  he  served  as  constructing  quar- 
termaster in  both  Honolulu  and  in  Yellowstone  National  Park.  While 
yet  a  captain,  he  commanded  the  Second  Battalion,  Fourteenth  Infantry, 
and  under  his  training  that  battalion  made  an  unequaled  record  in 
known  distance  firing.  While  a  major  he  was  adjutant-general  of  the 
National  Guard  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  which  he  developed  to  a 
high  state  of  efficiency.  As  colonel  of  the  Thirty-eighth  Infantry  he 
instilled  that  fighting  spirit  which  won  for  that  regiment  its  fame  as 
the  "Rock  of  the  Marne." 

As  brigadier-general  he  took  command  of  the  Ninth  Infantry  Bri- 
gade. In  the  quiet  Anould  and  St.  Die  sectors  he  gave  the  units  of  the 
brigade  effective  training  for  the  big  operations  that  were  to  follow.  In 
the  St.  Mihiel  offensive.  General  Castner's  brigade  was  at  first  in 
reserve  with  the  Tenth  v  Brigade  in  line.  When  passage  of  lines  was 
made  he  pushed  his  outpost  lines  up  near  to  the  Hindenburg  Line.  In 
the  first  phase  of  the  Meuse-Argonne  offensive  his  brigade  captured 
Cunel,  and  drove  the  enemy  from  the  Bois-de-la-Pultiere  and  the  north- 
western Bois-de-Foret.  In  the  second  phase  of  the  Meuse-Argonne 
offensive.  General  Castner's  brigade  captured  Aincreville,  Clery-le- 
Grand,  Clery-le-Petit,  Bois  de  Babiemont,  the  Punchbowl  and  Doulcon. 
Then  the  brigade  forced  the  difficult  crossing  of  the  river  Meuse,  and 
fighting  northward  captured  in  succession  Dun-sur-Meuse,  Milly-devant- 
Dun,  Lion-devant-Dun,  Cote  St.  Germain,  Charmois  Chateau,  Mouzay. 
and  the  Foret-de-Woevre.

In  appreciation  for  his  services  in  the  Meuse-Argonne  operation, 
General  Castner  was  awarded  the  Distinguished  Service  Medal.  He 
has  been  cited  in  Fifth  Division  Orders.  General  Castner  is  a  man's 
man,  a  soldier  and  a  leader.  In  mental  and  physical  alertness,  in  devo- 
tion to  duty,  in  zeal  and  energy,  he  is  an  example,  alike  to  men  and 
officers.  There  is  no  man  in  his  brigade  who  will  not  gladly  join  him 
at  any  time  for  any  duty.  While  his  brigade  formed  part  of  the  Army 
of  Occupation,  General  Castner  took  the  course  of  instruction  at  the 
Army  Center  of  Artillery  Studies  at  Trier,  Germany. 

It  was  on  April  2,  1917,  that  President  Wilson  appeared  before 
Congress,  advising  a  declaration  of  war  against  Germany.  On  the 
same  date  Edward  F.  Farrington,  mayor  of  New  Brunswick  issued  a 
proclamation,  which  was  printed  in  six  different  languages — English, 
German,  Hungarian,  Polish,  Italian  and  Greek^n  which  he  assured  the 
foreign  born  residents  every  protection  as  long  as  they  remained  loyal. 
There  was  not,  however,  during  the  entire  period  of  the  war,  the  least 
sign  of  disloyalty  shown  by  any  of  the  inhabitants.  Every  precaution 
was  taken  to  insure  public  safety ;  a  Home  Defense  League  was  formed, 
and  the  water  plant,  bridges,  factories  and  public  buildings  were  placed 
under  guard.  The  Pennsylvania  railroad  bridge  was  carefully  watched ; 
the  first  real  sign  of  threatening  war  was  the  placing  of  guards  and  the 
building  of  guard  houses  at  each  end  of  the  bridge,  on  the  tow  path 
and  on  the  bridge  proper. 

It  was  on  April  6,  1917,  that  Company  H  of  the  Second  Regiment  of 
New  Jersey,  sixty-eight  men  strong,  under  command  of  Captain  J. 
Bayard  Kirkpatrick,  left  New  Brunswick  for  Trenton,  thence  to  Cam- 
den, and  were  detailed  to  points  to  be  guarded.  Events  followed  in 
quick  succession.  June  5,  1917,  was  registration  day;  the  total  for  the 
city  was  2,423  whites,  162  blacks,  1,713  aliens;  totalling  to  4,298.  Ex- 
emption was  demanded  by  a  very  small  percentage  of  native-born  Ameri- 
cans. Statistics  show  that  of  the  2,701  men  first  called  for  examination, 
240  failed  to  appear,  while  71  had  previously  enlisted;  rejected  for 
physical  disabilities  and  other  causes,  1,380.  The  registration  for  young 
men  reaching  twenty-one  years  of  age  since  June  5,  1917,  added  256  to 
the  list  of  draft  registrants.  The  registration  of  September  12,  1918, 
for  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and  forty-five  years,  enrolled  for  the 
New  National  army  was  5,545  in  New  Brunswick  proper,  and  in  Mid- 
dlesex county,  outside  of  Perth  Amboy,  20,223  men.  Of  the  men 
legistered  in  New  Brunswick,  2,574  were  native-born  citizens,  573f 
naturalized  citizens,  133  citizens  by  father's  naturalization,  making  a 
total  of  3,280  citizens  eligible  for  military  service.  Of  the  other  men 
registered,  766  had  taken  out  first  papers,  and  1,389  were  non-declarant 
aliens,  5,204  were  white,  216  black,  15  were  Chinamen.  The  aliens 
were  mainly  Austrians  and  Hungarians,  578  of  these  being  non-declarant,

while  338  had  taken  out  first  papers;  118  declarants  and  184  non-declar- 
ants were  Italians;  115  declarants  and  143  non-declarants  claimed 
Russia  as  the  country  of  their  nativity;  the  Greeks  were  represented 
by  23  declarants  and  169  non-declarants;  Turkey  by  18  declarants  and 
134  non-declarants;  while  the  German  Imperial  Government  was  rep- 
resented by  31  declarants  and  15  non-declarants.  The  remainder  were 
divided  between  France,  Portugal,  China,  Japan,  Denmark,  Netherlands, 
Roumania,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Mexico,  Central  and  South 
America  and  Bulgaria.  The  new  recruits  left  for  the  training  camps  as 
they  were  called,  where  they  were  organized  into  regiments,  eventually 
becoming  a  part  of  the  United  States  forces  in  France. 

The  statement  of  New  Brunswick's  World  War  activities — con- 
tributions of  men  and  means — will  be  found  in  the  Appendix,  on  con- 
cluding pages  of  this  History.

CHAPTER  XXVII. 
PERTH  AMBOY. 

The  early  settlement  of  Perth  Amboy,  the  hopes  of  its  progenitors 
and  the  way  in  which  the  prospects  of  the  carefully  planned  settlement  at 
the  mouth  of  the  Raritan  river  were  not  realized,  suggest  the  life  of  the 
average  human  being.  Born  to  fond  parents,  what  dreams  there  are  of 
future  greatness  and  of  wonderful  accomplishments,  and  how  seldom 
do  subsequent  developments  agree  with  the  plans  and  predictions  of 
those  who  were  interested  in  our  advent  into  the  world.  The  settlement 
of  Perth  Amboy,  its  location,  the  planning  of  its  institutions  and  its 
thoroughfares,  were  in  no  way  a  matter  of  accident.  Wise  heads  in  Scot- 
land and  England  planned  the  new  home  for  their  settlers,  and  figured 
that  they  were  founding  a  city  which  was  to  rival  London  as  a  commer- 
cial port  and  as  one  of  the  great  cities  of  the  world.  Men  and  women 
were  sent  here  of  the  sturdy  Scotch  stock ;  the  infant  Amboy  was  given 
the  impetus  of  official  approval,  and  funds  were  not  lacking  for  all  neces- 
sities ;  but  for  two  centuries  it  proved  a  laggard,  and  only  within  the  last 
three  decades  has  Perth  Amboy  given  any  intimation  that  the  hopes  of 
those  who  thought  and  planned  for  a  great  city  may  ever  be  realized.  In 
early  writings  reference  to  the  country  at  the  mouth  of  the  Raritan  river 
is  found,  and  more  than  thirty  years  before  the  first  shipload  of  settlers 
crossed  the  Atlantic  for  the  new  home  in  America,  the  region  was  char- 
ted and  an  estimate  of  its  advantages  and  its ,  resources  sent  back  to 
London  for  the  edification  of  the  royal  owners  of  the  land  and  their 
retainers. 

What  is  now  the  land  within  the  corporate  limits  of  Perth  Amboy 
was  set  aside  as  the  particular  property  of  the  Lords  Proprietors  as  early 
as  1669,  so  reserved  in  the  charter  granted  to  Woodbridge  in  that  year. 
The  reservation  of  this  tract  of  land,  accessible  from  tide  water,  high  and 
dry,  without  an  equal  anywhere  in  the  entire  State,  is  credited  to  the  fore- 
sight and  judgment  of  Governor  Carteret.  Its  position,  as  early  histor- 
ians have  pointed  out,  presented  facilities  for  almost  every  pursuit  that 
an  enterprising  people  might  adopt ;  and  the  failure  to  make  it  a  place  of 
more  extensive  trade  than  it  has  yet  become,  takes  nothing  from  the 
credit  due  the  first  Governor  for  selecting  so  eligible  a  situation  for  a 
town.  The  thoroughness  with  which  the  royal  proprietors  of  the  prov- 
ince planned  the  settlement  of  Amboy,  or  Amboy  Point,  as  it  was  first 
called,  may  be  realized  by  reading  the  following  "proposals"  for  building 
and  settling  the  town : 


362  MIDDLESEX 

Forasmuch  as  Ambo  Point  is  a  sweet,  wholesome  and  delightful 
place,  proper  for  trade,  by  reason  of  its  commodious  situation,  upon  a 
safe  harbor,  being  likewise  accommodated  with  a  navigable  river,  and 
fresh  water,  and  bath,  by  many  persons  of  the  greatest  experience  and 
best  judgment,  been  approved  for  the  goodness  of  the  air,  soil  and  situ- 
ation. 

We,  the  proprietors,  purpose  by  the  help  of  Almighty  God,  with  all 
convenient  speed,  to  build  a  convenient  town,  for  merchandise,  trade  and 
fishery,  on  Ambo  Point ;  and  because  persons  that  hath  a  desire  to  plant 
there,  may  not  be  disappointed  for  want  of  proposals,  we,  the  proprietors, 
offer  these  following : 

First ;  We  intend  to  divide  fifteen  hundred  acres  of  land  upon  Ambo 
Point  into  one  hundred  and  fifty  lots;  which  lots  shall  consist  of  ten 
acres  the  lot,  one  hundred  of  the  lots  we  are  willing  to  sell  here,  and 
fifty  we  reserve  for  such  as  are  in  America,  and  have  long  desired  to 
settle  there. 

Secondly;  The  price  of  each  lot  shall  be  fifteen  pounds  sterling,  to 
such  who  purchase  before  the  twenty-fifth  of  December,  1682;  and  to 
such  who  purchase  afterwards,  before  the  twenty-iifth  of  December, 
1683,  twenty  pounds  sterling. 

Thirdly;  Every  lot  is  to  be  divided  equally  as  the  goodness  of  the 
place  doth  require,  and  the  situation  can  admit. 

Fourthly;  The  most  convenient  spot  of  ground  for  a  town,  shall  be 
divided  into  one  hundred  and  fifty  equal  shares,  and  set  out  into  streets, 
according  to  rules  of  art;  and  no  persons  shall  be  preferred  before 
another  in  choice,  whether  purchaser  or  proprietor. 

Fifthly;  We  reserve  four  acres  for  a  market  place,  townhouse,  etc., 
and  three  acres  for  public  wharfage. 

Sixthly;  Each  purchaser  is  obliged  to  build  a  dwelling  house  in  the 
place  designed  for  the  town,  and  to  clear  three  acres  of  upland,  in  three 
years,  or  else  the  proprietors  to  be  reinstated  in  such  lots  wherein  default 
is  made,  repaying  the  purchase  money. 

Seventhly;  We,  the  proprietors,  do  within  a  year  hope,  by  God's 
assistance,  to  build  for  each  of  us  one  house  upon  Ambo  Point;  which 
we  intend  shall  stand  in  an  orderly  manner,  according  to  the  best  and 
most  convenient  model;  and  in  pursuance  of  the  design  of  the  proposi- 
tion abovesaid. 

Eighthly;  And  for  the  encouragement  of  carpenters,  joiners,  brick 
and  tile  makers,  bricklayers,  masons,  sawyers  and  laborers  of  all  sorts, 
who  are  willing  to  go  and  employ  themselves  and  servants,  in  helping  to 
clear  ground,  and  build  houses  upon  the  general  acount  of  and  for  the 
proprietors. 

The  said  proprietors  will  engage  to  find  them  work,  and  current  pay 
for  the  same,  in  money  or  clothes  and  provision  of  which  there  is  plenty 
(as  beef,  pork,  corn,  etc.)  according  to  the  market  price  at  New  York, 
during  the  space  of  one  year  at  least,  next  after  the  twenty-fifth  of 
December  1682;  in  which  time  (in  God's  blessing  and  through  their 
industry)  they  may  have  got  wherewith  to  buy  cows,  horses,  hogs  and 
other  goods,  to  stock  that  land,  which  they  in  the  meantime  may  take  up, 
according  to  the  concessions;  neither  shall  such  persons  pay  rent  for 
their  said  land,  so  long  as  they  are  employed  in  the  proprietor's  work; 
and  their  wages  shall  at  all  times  be  so  much  as  other  such  artificers  and 


PERTH  AMBOY  363 

laborers,  in  the  said  province  usually  have,  nor  shall  they  be  obliged  to 
work  for  the  proprietors  longer  than  they  find  encouragement  so  to  do. 

Ninthly ;  And  for  the  more  ready  and  certain  employing  those  work- 
men and  laborers  that  shall  transport  themselves  to  East  Jersey,  this  is 
to  let  all  laborers  and  persons  that  shall  transport  themselves  know,  they 
must  upon  their  arrival  upon  that  place,  repair  to  the  register  of  the 
above  said  province,  and  enter  themselves  according  to  their  respective 
qualities  and  designs  and  thereupon  they  shall  be  entered  into  the 
service  and  pay  of  the  proprietors. 

So  slowly  were  the  hopes  of  the  owners  of  the  land  realized,  that  it 
was  not  until  the  census  of  1840,  a  century  and  a  half  after  the  original 
settlement,  that  the  population  reached  1,000,  the  figures  at  the  end  of 
that  decade  being  1,303.  An  even  half  dozen  of  the  royal  governors, 
whose  line  began  with  Carteret  and  ended  with  the  gifted  Franklin,  made 
Perth  Amboy  their  home  during  at  least  a  part  of  their  terms.  The  first 
was  Robert  Hunter,  prominent  as  a  soldier  and  as  a  writer,  besides  being 
of  high  rank  as  a  statesman.  William  Burnet,  polished  and  accomplished 
son  of  the  great  bishop  of  that  name,  honored  the  people  whom  he  gov- 
erned by  living  among  them  for  a  time.  Then  came  John  Hamilton, 
Francis  Bernard  and  Thomas  Boone,  the  latter  followed  by  Franklin, 
who,  like  most  of  those  who  came  to  the  Jerseys  at  all,  lived  part  of  the 
time  in  Burlington. 

As  a  city,  Perth  Amboy  came  into  corporate  existence  in  the  year 
1718,  when,  under  date  of  August  24th  a  royal  charter  was  granted  upon 
the  recommendation  of  Governor  Hunter.  The  seal  adopted  was  that  in 
use  at  the  present  time,  and  on  which  the  name  of  Perth  Amboy  is  used. 
Perth  was  taken  as  a  compliment  to  the  Earl  of  Perth,  who  was  one  of 
the  original  owners  of  the  land  by  royal  grant.  The  attempt  was  appar- 
ently made  to  call  the  settlement  by  that  name  alone,  but  the  designation 
"Ambo"  or  "Amboy  Point"  had  become  so  fixed  by  constant  usage  that 
Perth  Amboy  was  easily  agreed  upon  as  the  title  to  be  used  in  the  char- 
ter. The  right  to  select  the  mayor  was  reserved  to  the  royal  governor, 
and  it  was  not  until  all  the  prerogatives  of  the  crown  were  abrogated 
that  the  people  of  the  city  were  allowed  to  select  by  ballot  their  chief 
magistrate.  The  governor  also  named  the  sherifif  and  the  water  bailiff. 
The  recorder  and  the  clerk  were  also  designated  by  the  governor,  but  the 
people  were  allowed  to  choose  the  aldermen,  assistant  aldermen,  cham- 
berlain, coroner,  overseers  of  the  poor  and  constables,  but  none  was 
allowed  to  vote  except  he  be  a  freeholder. 

The  device  on  the  city  seal  is  thus  described :  "On  the  dexter  a  hunt- 
ing horn,  and  over  it  Arte  non  impetu;  on  the  sinister  a  ship  riding  at 
anchor  in  the  harbor,  under  it  Partus  Optimus."  The  connection  between 
the  hunting  horn  and  its  motto  and  the  past  history  or  future  destinies 
of  the  city  might  afford  matter  for  discussion  for  a  whole  college  of 


364  MIDDLESEX 

heraldry,  were  not  the  clue  presented  in  Governor  Hunter's  own  escutch- 
eon. The  petitioners  for  the  charter  for  the  city  missed  no  chance  to 
win  the  favor  of  His  Excellency,  and  placed  upon  the  seal  of  the  cor- 
poration the  arms  of  the  governor's  family. 

The  careless  handling  of  public  affairs,  which  is  a  curse  of  American 
municipalities,  manifested  itself  throughout  the  history  of  Perth  Amboy. 
Documents  pertaining  to  the  establishment  of  the  city  and  its  institutions 
are  wholly  in  private  hands,  if  they  remain  at  all.  A  comparatively  few 
are  preserved  in  the  New  Jersey  Historical  Society's  vaults  in  Newark, 
but  even  in  recent  years  important  papers  that  should  never  have  been 
outside  the  City  Hall  of  Perth  Amboy  have  turned  up  at  auctions  and  in 
book  stores  in  various  parts  of  the  country,  even  now  to  become  the 
property  of  private  collectors,  rather  than  of  the  municipality  to  which 
they  belong  by  a  right  and  title  which  cannot  be  set  aside.  There  are 
practically  no  records  of  the  city  before  1880,  and  many  since  that  date 
are  incomplete.  This  is  deeply  regretted  by  every  student  of  local  his- 
tory. Were  it  not  for  the  records  of  the  State,  none  too  faithfully  kept  as 
to  detail,  and  the  writings  of  William  Dunlap  and  later  of  Whitehead, 
scarcely  anything  would  be  known  of  the  first  century  and  a  half  of  Perth 
Amboy.  Both  of  these  writers  gave  us  reminiscent  sketches  rather  than 
detailed  or  consecutive  historical  record,  but  those  interested  in  the  sub- 
ject are  deeply  grateful  for  the  morsels  that  have  been  transmitted  to  this 
generation  by  these  two  gifted  writers. 

The  real  industrial  life  of  Perth  Amboy  began  with  the  decision  of 
the  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  Company  to  make  the  city  its  tidewater 
terminus.  Coal  wharves  were  erected,  and  in  1876  the  shipment  of 
anthracite  coal  to  eastern  and  foreign  ports  was  commenced.  After  a 
few  years  the  shipments  of  coal  aggregated  more  than  two  million  tons 
annually,  and  for  a  long  time  the  total  amount  handled  has  been  in 
excess  of  that  total.  The  coming  and  going  of  coal  carriers  brought 
other  industries  to  the  awakened  city.  A  shipbuilder,  Hugh  Ramsay, 
came  here  and  built  barges  for  the  railroad  company  and  then 
for  other  concerns,  private  parties  and  foreign  governments.  Dry  docks 
were  brought  here,  others  were  constructed,  and  for  thirty  years  Perth 
Amboy  has  been  a  center  of  much  activity  in  this  important  line  of 
industry. 

There  came  the  tremendous  Guggenheim  interests  and  established 
the  gold,  silver,  copper  and  lead  plant  of  the  American  Smelting  Com- 
pany, with  the  United  Lead  Company,  which  closed  twenty-six  refineries 
when  it  opened  its  Perth  Amboy  plant.  The  Lewisohn  Brothers  estab- 
lished the  Raritan  Copper  Works,  which  almost  at  once  became  the 
largest  electrolytic  copper  refinery  in  the  world.  The  Barber  Asphalt 
Paving  Company  erected  huge  refineries  and  subsidiary  plants,  refined  all

ihe  asphalt  it  uses  east  of  the  Mississippi  here,  and  turned  out  thousands 
of  rolls  of  roofing  paper  annually.  The  United  States  Cartridge  Company 
naturally  followed  the  United  Lead  Company,  and  the  Cheesebrough 
Manufacturing  Company  secured  a  site  on  the  Raritan  river,  within  the 
limits  of  the  city,  where  the  vaseline  preparations  used  by  the  world  are 
produced.  Attracted  by  the  transportation  facilities  and  the  large  pro- 
duction of  copper  in  Perth  Amboy,  came  the  Standard  Underground 
Cable  Company,  with  its  parent  plant  at  Pittsburgh  and  a  branch  at  Oak- 
land, California,  to  manufacture  tens  of  thousands  of  miles  of  wire  of  all 
sorts  and  employ  hundreds  of  men  and  women  in  its  various  departments. 

More  than  thirty  years  ago  the  Roessler-Hasslacher  Chemical  Com- 
pany came  to  America  and  erected  a  small  plant  in  Perth  Amboy,  in 
which  a  variety  of  chemicals  were  produced  by  methods  in  use  in  Ger- 
many. To-day  the  company  operates  three  large  plants  which  turn  out 
coloring  materials,  cyanides  and  other  equally  important  chemical  com- 
modities, to  supply  the  American  market,  in  addition  to  fathering  the 
General  Bakelite  Company,  which  has  its  large  and  important  plant  here. 

From  the  beginning,  clay  products  have  played  a  large  part  in  the 
industrial  development  of  Perth  Amboy.  Beds  of  clay  in  and  about  the 
city  produce  that  quality  of  mother  earth  best  adapted  for  fine  brick, 
conduits,  building  blocks  of  all  sorts  and  for  all  uses,  and  terra  cotta. 
The  terra  cotta  products  of  Perth  Amboy  adorn  the  buildings  of  this  and 
other  lands  erected  when  that  was  a  popular  form  of  architectural  orna- 
mentation. To-day  the  skyscrapers  of  the  great  cities  of  America  are 
being  constructed  of  blocks  and  tile  made  in  and  about  Perth  Amboy. 
Calvin  Pardee,  of  the  prominent  Pennsylvania  family  of  that  name  so 
long  identified  with  the  mining  and  shipment  of  coal,  established  a  tile 
manufactory  and  later  a  steel  rod  mill,  both  of  which  are  now  in  other 
hands. 

Old  as  Perth  Amboy  is,  and  prominent  as  it  was  in  the  early  history 
of  the  province  of  East  Jersey,  there  is  little  to-day  to  remind  us  of  the 
early  days  of  the  infant  city.  Writing  nearly  three-quarters  of  a  century 
ago,  William  A.  Whitehead,  preeminently  the  historian  of  Perth  Amboy, 
said  that  Perth  Amboy  had  then  no  crumbling  castles,  no  time-worn  bat- 
tlemented  walls,  nor  monuments  of  fallen  greatness,  such  as  excite  the 
veneration  and  sympathies  of  the  traveler  among  the  dilapidated  cities  of 
the  Eastern  hemi^here.  Since  Whitehead's  day,  the  old  British  barracks, 
erected  midway  in  the  eighteenth  century  to  shelter  the  royal  troops 
returning  from  Cuba,  have  been  removed.  The  ground  they  occupied  is 
now  the  site  of  the  grammar  school,  a  magnificent  monument  to  the 
efforts  of  Perth  Amboy  to  educate  the  children  who  came  to  bless  the 
homes  of  her  citizens,  to  many  of  whom  the  public  school  is  a  wonderful 
agency  for  the  Americanization  of  those  of  foreign  birth  or  parentage.

At  the  same  time  there  is  a  growing  number  who  regret  that  the  bar- 
racks were  not  preserved  and  the  grammar  school  erected  elsewhere. 
Until  the  destruction  of  the  old  buildings,  the  walls  of  which  were  con- 
structed of  brick  brought  from  England,  the  old  rifle-pit  remained  almost 
as  it  was  when  first  dug — in  summer  a  pond  in  which  tiny  ships  were 
sailed  and  miniature  navies  fought  their  battles;  and  in  winter  a  safe 
place  for  those  who  sought  the  pleasures  of  ice  skating. 

The  old  mansion,  built  as  the  home  of  the  colonial .  governor  of  the 
Jerseys  when  one  capital  was  maintained  in  Amboy  and  the  other  in 
Burlington,  stands  on  Kearny  avenue.  William  Franklin,  son  of  the 
great  philosopher  and  statesman,  was  the  last  royal  governor  of  the 
colony  to  occupy  the  mansion.  Shortly  after  the  Revolution,  the  prop- 
erty, comprising  a  magnificent  estate,  passed  into  private  hands.  Later 
a  destructive  fire  visited  it,  but  the  building  was  restored  and  until  the 
Civil  War  wrecked  southern  fortunes,  it  was  a  favorite  summer  resort 
for  prominent  families  from  south  of  the  Mason  and  Dixon  line.  It  was 
then  known  as  the  Brighton  House,  with  checkered  career  as  a  public 
house  of  entertainment.  After  the  war  was  ended,  Matthias  Bruen  pre- 
sented the  entire  property  to  the  Presbyterian  church  to  be  maintained 
as  a  home  for  infirm  clergy,  their  wives,  widows  and  orphans.  Thus  it 
continued  for  more  than  a  score  of  years,  when  the  church  decided  that 
it  could  not  afford  to  longer  keep  it,  and  returned  it  to  the  Bruen  family, 
and  it  is  now  in  use  as  an  apartment  house,  occupied  by  schoolteachers, 
lawyers,  and  other  professional  people.  Many  people  who  otherwise 
know  nothing  of  Perth  Amboy's  history  are  familiar  with  the  Parker 
Castle,  so-called  because  of  the  older  part  of  it,  built  with  heavy  stone 
walls  in  the  time  when  Indians  were  numerous  in  these  parts  and  the 
peaceful  citizen  sought  to  protect  his  sleep  at  night  and  his  family  by  day. 
The  frame  part  of  the  old  castle,  which  sheltered  generation  after  genera- 
tion of  the  Parker  family  for  nearly  two  centuries,  was  old  when  the 
colonies  fought  the  mother  country,  although  erected  long  after  the  stone 
portion  had  been  in  use.  The  building  extends  from  Water  street  to 
Front,  and  years  ago  the  half  block  bounded  by  Water  street  and  Wil- 
locks  lane  was  Mrs.  Parker's  garden. 

On  the  corner  of  Smith  and  Water  streets  is  the  old  Parker  law  office, 
originally  a  one-story  frame  structure  which  now  is  two  stories  high 
because  the  Smith  street  grade  was  lowered  at  that  point  about  ten  feet. 
There  before  the  Revolution  the  Parkers  gave  legal  advice  to  their  towns- 
men, and  were  consiHted  by  men  of  prominence  through  New  Jersey  and 
New  York  who  were  glad  to  have  the  benefit  of  their  knowledge  and 
advice.  There,  at  the  outbreak  of  the  Revolution,  Cortlandt  Skinner,  the 
royal  attorney  general,  had  his  office.  Two  of  his  students  at  the  time 
were  Andrew  Bell  and  Joseph  Bloomfield.     Skinner  and  Bell  remained

loyal  to  the  British  Crown,  the  former  becoming  a  major-general  in  his 
Majesty's  forces,  and  Bell  served  throughout  the  conflict  as  private  sec- 
retary to  Sir  Henry  Clinton.  Bloomfield  led  American  troops  as  a  major- 
general,  and  later  was  twice  governor  of  New  Jersey,  besides  serving  the 
State  well  as  attorney-general.  Bell's  old  mansion  still  stands  on  Kearny 
avenue,  occupied  by  Miss  Emily  Paterson,  a  great  granddaughter  of  Wil- 
liam Paterson,  one  of  the  infant  State's  first  two  United  States  Senators, 
and  who  graced  the  Federal  Supreme  Court,  after  serving  as  Governor. 

There  is  not  much  left  of  the  original  building  in  which  the  Provincial 
Assembly  met  immediately  after  the  settlement  of  Ambo  Point.  It  was 
the  capital  of  East  Jersey,  and  then  passed  through  various  degrees  of 
usefulness  of  a  public  or  semi-public  nature  for  several  decades.  It 
was  built  and  rebuilt  and  enlarged  in  various  directions  until  for  some 
years  it  has  served  as  city  hall  and  police  headquarters.  For  many  years 
the  upper  floor  was  a  lodge  room,  and  the  only  approach  to  a  place  of 
theatrical  entertainment  of  which  the  city  could  boast  for  many  years 
was  the  room  on  the  second  floor  now  used  for  the  sessions  of  the  city 
council  and  the  district  court.  • 

Several  buildings  used  privately,  survived  from  early  colonial  days. 
The  home  of  the  East  Jersey  Club  on  High  street  was  one  of  the  first 
built  in  the  city.  It  was  saved  from  demolition  by  Dr.  Francis  W. 
Kitchel,  and  occupied  by  him  for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century.  On 
some  old  maps  of  the  city  it  is  shown  as  the  residence  of  Neil  Campbell, 
one  of  the  most  prominent  immigrants  from  Scotland  to  the  infant 
metropolis.  John  Watson,  the  first  portrait  painter  in  the  American 
colonies,  came  from  Scotland  in  1715  and  lived  here  until  his  death. 

The  point  at  the  mouth  of  the  Raritan  river  is  first  mentioned  in  an  Indian 
deed  given  to  Augustine  Hermann,  a  resident  of  New  Amsterdam,  Decem- 
ber 8,  1651.  In  this  deed  the  point  was  called  Ompoge,  but  in  a  subsequent 
one  recorded  in  1665  by  which  John  Bailes  or  Baily,  one  of  the  patentees 
of  the  Elizabethtown  tract,  deeded  to  Governor  Carteret,  the  country  is 
called  Arthur  Cull,  or  Emboyle,  which  a  year  later  was  written  Amboyle. 
From  these  names  Ambo  was  conferred  upon  the  point  for  some  time 
after  its  settlement.  In  granting  the  charter  to  the  town  of  Woodbridge, 
June  10,  1669,  Ambo  Point  was  reserved  by  the  lord  proprietors  in  lieu 
of  the  seventh  part  mentioned  in  the  concessions.  This  reservation  con- 
sisted of  nine  hundred  acres  of  upland  and  a  hundred  acres  of  meadow. 
Little  was  accomplished  for  the  next  decade  towards  the  settlement  of 
the  point.  Samuel  Groom,  who  accompanied  Governor  Rudyard,  who 
succeeded  Carteret,  to  the  province  in  his  official  capacity  of  surveyor- 
general,  surveyed  the  harbor  and  sounded  the  channel  from  Amboy,  as 
it  now  began  to  be  called,  to  Sandy  Hook.    In  his  report  made  Aug^ust  11, 


368  MIDDLESEX 

1683,  the  surveyor-general  says  that  there  were  three  houses  at  the 
Point,  and  three  others  were  ready  to  be  set  up.  They  were  thirty  feet 
long,  sixteen  or  eighteen  feet  wide,  ten  feet  between  joints,  with  a  double 
chimney  made  of  lumber  and  clay.  Groom  laid  out  the  town  into  one 
hundred  and  fifty  lots,  and  under  instructions  of  the  proprietors  allowed 
for  wide  streets,  also  each  house  lot  to  have  yard  and  garden. 

The  arrival  of  Gawen  Lawrie  to  supersede  Rudyard  as  deputy- 
governor  gave  a  new  impetus  to  affairs  at  Amboy.  He,  following  the 
instructions  of  the  proprietors,  gave  the  name  of  Perth  to  their  new  town 
in  honor  of  James,  Earl  of  Perth,  one  of  their  associates,  and  the  title  of 
Amboy  was  dropped  for  some  time  except  when  applied  to  the  Point.  In 
the  governor's  report,  he  states  that  he  has  finally  settled  on  a  place 
where  a  ship  of  three  hundred  tons  can  ride  safely  at  anchor  and  be 
connected  at  low  tide  by  plank  with  the  shore ;  that  he  had  laid  out  sixty 
lots  of  an  acre  each  on  the  river  and  forty  backward  between  these  and 
the  river,  the  backward  lots  being  on  a  highway  one  hundred  feet  broad, 
including  a  place  for  a  market,  with  cross  streets  from  the  river  to  the 
nferket.  The  governor  also  laid  out  four  hundred  acres  divided  into 
forty-eight  parts ;  sixteen  of  these  were  taken  up  by  the  Scottish  proprie- 
tors, eight  by  proprietors  residing  in  the  province,  twenty  were  taken 
by  other  people,  while  four  acres  were  to  lie  until  the  proprietors  agreed 
to  divide  it,  as  people  came  over;  the  highways  and  wharfs  were  one 
hundred  feet  broad,  and  a  row  of  trees  along  the  river  was  left  for  shade. 
The  purchasers  of  the  town  lots  were  to  pay  £20,  and  agreed  to  build  a 
house  therein  thirty  feet  long,  eighteen  feet  broad,  and  eighteen  feet 
high,  to  be  finished  within  a  year.  Between  forty  and  fifty  acres  were 
reserved  for  the  governor's  house,  as  the  proprietors  had  determined  to 
make  Perth  the  capital  of  the  province. 

The  quantity  of  land  laid  out,  including  the  governor's  house  and  pub- 
lic highways,  was  estimated  at  two  hundred  acres;  about  the  same 
number  of  acres  three  miles  up  the  Raritan  river  was  retained  in  common 
to  furnish  grass  for  the  settlers.  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  these  plans 
were  not  fully  carried  out ;  they  had  to  yield  to  the  sordid  consideration 
of  the  value  of  the  land,  and  were  ignored  to  facilitate  the  commercial 
operations  of  the  new  provincial  capital.  Under  strong  pressure  of  the 
proprietors,  the  deputy-governor  in  1684  carried  their  wishes  into  effect 
and  the  seat  of  government  was  moved  from  Elizabethtown.  Necessary 
steps  were  taken  to  procure  the  rights  and  privileges  of  a  port  of  entry 
to  advance  the  prosperity  of  the  new  town  of  Perth,  and  facilitate  its 
commercial  intercourse  with  the  other  provinces  and  the  mother  country. 
The  actual  residence  in  Amboy  of  the  chief  officers  of  the  province  is 
uncertain;    Rudyard  and  Lawrie,  while  they  held  lands  in  the  town, 


PERTH  AMBOY  369 

never  gained  a  permanent  residence.  Hamilton  and  Campbell  may  have 
been  permanently  established,  the  former  prior  to  1689  and  again  from 
1692  to  1698 ;  the  latter  probably  during  his  brief  term.  After  the  sur- 
render of  the  government  of  the  province  to  the  Crown  in  1701,  while 
New  York  participated  in  the  honor  flowing  from  the  joint  possession 
of  a  governor,  Richard  Ingoldsby  was  lieutenant-governor  under  Lords 
Cornbury  and  Lovelace,  Jihere  is  no  trace  of  a  residence  in  Amboy  of  him 
or  any  of  the  presidents  of  the  council  who  succeeded  him  down  to  1736. 
Governor  Hunter  was  the  first  of  the  royal  governors  who  regarded  the 
province  with  sufficient  favor  to  secure  upon  its  soil  anything  like  a  per- 
manent home.  His  house  was  located  on  a  knoll  south  of  St.  Peter's 
Church,  commanding  a  fine  view  of  the  harbor,  the  bay  and  ocean 
beyond.  This  was  his  official  residence  while  on  his  tours  of  duty  in 
New  Jersey,  here  he  retired  for  recreation  from  the  weighty  cares  of  the 
administration  of  affairs  of  the  province  of  New  York.  His  successor. 
Governor  Burnet,  purchased  the  Hunter  residence,  which  he  occupied 
during  his  term  of  eight  years.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Governors 
Montgomerie  and  Cosby  ever  had  a  fixed  residence  in  Amboy.  The  next 
governor,  John  Hamilton,  built  what  afterwards  became  known  as  the 
"Lewis  Place,"  overlooking  the  broad  bay  formed  by  the  junction  of  the 
Raritan  and  the  Sound  with  Sandy  Hook  inlet.  His  successor,  Lewis 
Morris,  resided  most  of  his  time  near  Trenton ;  his  successor,  Jonathan 
Belcher,  was  more  pleased  with  the  attractions  of  Elizabethtown  as  a 
home  during  the  ten  years  of  his  holding  the  office  of  governor.  Gov- 
ernor Bernard  resided  in  what  was  known  as  the  Johnstone  Mansion, 
which  stood  halfway  between  the  "Long  Ferry"  and  "Sandy  Point." 
During  the  short  period  of  the  administration  of  affairs  by  Governors 
Boone  and  Hardy,  there  is  no  evidence  to  the  contrary  of  their  being 
permanent  residents  of  Perth  Amboy.  The  last  of  the  royal  governors, 
William  Franklin,  became  the  occupant  of  the  Proprietors'  House  in 
October,  1774;  it  was  afterwards  enlarged  and  improved  and  became  the 
residence  of  Matthias  Bruen.  It  was  in  this  mansion  that  Governor 
Franklin  was  arrested  June  17,  1776,  by  a  detachment  of  militia  under 
Colonel  (afterwards.  General)  Heard,  by  order  of  the  Provincial  Con- 
vention or  Congress.  A  fuller  detailed  account  of  the  royal  governors 
will  be  found  in  another  chapter  of  this  work. 

Among  the  early  settlers  of  the  new  town  of  Perth  was  Samuel 
Groom,  one  of  the  twenty-four  proprietaries,  sometimes  styled  Mariner 
of  Stepney;  he  was  dispossessed  as  surveyor-general  and  receiver-gen- 
eral by  Governor  Rudyard,  though  afterwards  reinstated  by  the  proprie- 
tors; he  died  in  1683,  leaving  on  the  stocks  unfinished  the  first  vessel 
built  in  East  Jersey.     His  successor,  William  Haige,  a  son-in-law  of 

Mid-24 


370  MIDDLESEX 

Governor  Lawrie,  was  a  man  much  respected  by  the  earliest  settlers. 
He  continued  to  perform  the  duties  of  the  two  offices  until  1686,  when  he 
was  succeeded  by  George  Keith  as  surveyor-general.  The  latter  has 
received  several  mentions  in  this  work,  as  also  has  his  deputy  and  suc- 
cessor, John  Reid.  The  prosperity  of  the  town  was  materially  advanced 
by  what  was  known  as  "William  Dockwra's  people."  While  this  gentle- 
man owned  several  town  lots  and  the  valley  of  the  Millstone  river  was 
his  property,  he  was  never  a  resident  of  the  province.  On  the  death 
of  William  Haige  he  was  appointed  receiver-general  and  treasurer;  in 
consideration  of  his  services  as  their  agent  in  London  the  proprietors 
gave  him  a  grant  of  one  thousand  acres  of  land.  "The  people"  men- 
tioned were  laborers  sent  over  to  America,  so  as  to  obtain  grants  for 
headlands  in  accordance  with  "the  Concessions" — Dockwra  receiving  a 
portion  of  their  earnings.  The  Scottish  proprietors  as  well  as  Dockwra 
sent  over  servants  and  poor  families,  to  whom  they  gave  stock,  and  for 
a  number  of  years  they  received  half  of  the  increase  excepting  milk, 
which  the  tenant  had  to  himself.  These  arrivals  of  laborers  amounted  to 
over  fifty  at  different  times.  The  arrival  of  Benjamin  Clarke  and  his  son 
Benjamin  in  1683  supplied  the  young  town  of  Perth  with  a  good  sta- 
tioner's shop,  which  included  a  library  of  books.  Clarke  received  grants 
for  eight  headlands  for  eight  others  besides  himself  and  son.  It  is  the 
presumption  that  his  house  stood  on  the  south  side  of  Market  street,  near 
its  junction  with  Water  street. 

The  unfortunate  termination  in  Scotland  of  the  Earl  of  Argyle's  expe- 
dition caused  a  large  number  of  the  natives  of  that  country  to  seek  refuge 
in  the  New  World.  Prominent  among  these  were  the  Campbells,  rela- 
tions of  the  Earl  of  Argyle,  a  family  obnoxious  to  the  government  for 
their  political  sentiments  and  affinities.  There  were  a  number  of  indi- 
viduals of  the  name  of  Campbell,  more  or  less  intimately  related  to  the 
deputy-governor  who  arrived  in  the  province  during  the  years  1684-85, 
but  John  and  Archibald,  sons  of  Lord  Neil,  were  both  identified  with  the 
settlement  of  Perth.  John  arrived  in  1684,  bringing  his  wife,  three  chil- 
dren and  eleven  servants,  to  swell  the  population  of  the  province.  He 
died  in  December,  1689,  leaving  two  daughters  and  a  son  John.  Archi- 
bald arrived  at  the  settlement  with  his  father,  but  there  is  no  record  of 
any  wife  or  children.  These  brothers  held  lots  in  a  ravine  north  of  the 
town,  which  was  known  at  one  time  as  "Campbell  GuUey."  There  is  no 
"authentic  list  of  the  Scotch  settlers  who  arrived  with  Lord  Campbell. 

An  arrival  of  more  than  ordinary  interest  to  the  new  settlement  was 
the  vessel  "Henry  and  Francis,"  freighted  with  Scots;  they  were  men 
upon  whom  persecution  had  wrought  its  work  of  purification,  whose 
souls  had  been  tempered  for  patient  endurance  by  sore  trials  and  mis-

fortunes.  Among  those  who  suffered  for  conscience  sake  in  submitting 
to  the  authority  of  Cromwell,  was  Sir  John  Scot  of  Scotstarbet  in  Edin- 
burghshire, upon  whom  the  lord-commissioner  inflicted  a  fine  of  £6,000. 
His  son,  George  Scot,  of  Pitlochie,  with  others,  scorned  to  secure  their 
liberty  by  taking  the  oath  of  supremacy.  After  suffering  numerous 
arrests  and  fines  for  attending  conventicles  and  for  non-conformity,  his 
petition  for  a  release  from  prison  was  granted,  on  his  agreeing  to  emi- 
grate to  the  new  plantations  and  take  with  him  Archibald  Riddle,  a 
cousin  of  his  wife,  one  of  the  obnoxious  preachers.  The  Laird  of  Pit- 
lochie's  position  in  society  and  connection  with  many  of  the  first  families 
of  the  kingdom,  the  persecutions  he  had  been  subjected  to,  increased  his 
notoriety  and  secured  for  him  for  the  work  he  contemplated  the  consider- 
ation of  his  countrymen.  His  intention  was  to  embark  with  his  family  and 
associate  with  him  a  number  of  the  oppressed,  for  the  purpose  of  finding 
an  asylum  in  America.  The  Council  on  Februtry  11,  1685,  authorized 
Scot  to  transport  to  the  plantations  "a  hundred  of  prisoners  confined  at 
Glasgow,  Edinburgh  and  Sterling,  if  they  were  willing  to  go,"  excluding 
those  who  were  "heritors  above  one  hundred  pounds  of  rent,"  and  such 
persons  as  were  under  bonds  to  appear  before  them  vvere  to  have  those 
bonds  returned  to  them  if  they  should  join  him.  Thus  being  authorized, 
the  Laird  of  Pitlochie  proceeded  to  assemble  his  company;  he  further 
requested  the  council  to  transfer  to  him  a  large  number  of  persons  who 
had  been  banished  to  Jamaica,  but  only  twelve  were  granted  to  him. 
Between  August  17  and  25,  one  hundred  persons  who  had  refused  the 
oath  of  allegiance  to  the  King  or  had  been  perviously  banished,  were 
delivered  to  Scot  to  be  transported  to  East  Jersey,  he  agreeing  and  giving 
security  to  land  them  there  prior  to  September,  1686,  or  suffer  a  penalty 
of  five  hundred  marks  in  case  of  failure  in  any  instance.  Other  persons 
were  afterwards  assigned  to  him  in  like  manner,  and  some  were  pro- 
hibited from  embarking. 

Scot  early  in  May  had  chartered  the  "Henry  and  Francis,"  a  ship 
of  three  hundred  and  fifty  tonnage,  equipped  with  twenty  great  guns, 
commanded  by  Richard  Hutton.  The  vessel  sailed  from  the  harbor  of 
Leith,  September  5,  1685,  the  whole  number  on  board  being  nearly  two 
hundred.  The  charge  for  transportation  was  £5  sterling  for  each  adult, 
and  to  each  of  those  who  were  unable  to  pay  for  their  passage  was 
promised  twenty-five  acres  of  land  and  a  new  suit  of  clothes  on  the 
completion  of  four  years  of  service,  to  those  who  advanced  the  requisite 
amount.  Many  of  the  passengers  afterwards  became  known  in  Ameri- 
can history  as  "Redemptioners."  The  voyage  was  beset  with  difficul- 
ties; many  deaths  occurred  during  the  voyage  owing  to  a  malignant 
fever  on  board  and  to  the  provisions  laid  in  by  the  captain,  the  meat, 
owing  probably  to  the  length  of  time  which  had  elapsed  since  the  vessel 


372  MIDDLESEX 

was  chartered,  becoming  offensive  and  uneatable.  The  deaths  numbered 
over  seventy,  among  them  the  Laird  of  Pitlochie,  his  wife,  his  sister- 
in-law  Lady  Arthernie,  and  her  two  children.  It  is  impossible  to  give 
a  complete  list  of  all  those  that  arrived  at  Perth  on  the  "Henry  and 
Francis."  but  from  various  records  we  submit  the  following: 

Robert  Adam,  John  Arbuckle,  John  Black,  George  Brown,  Robert 
Campbell,  David  Campbell,  William  Campbell,  John  Campbell,  Chris- 
tian Carie,  John  Crichton,  John  Corbet,  Andrew  Corbet,  John  Corsan

John  Watt,  Patrick  Walker,  Elizabeth  Whitelaw,  Grizel  Wotherspoon, 
William  Wilson,  Robert  Young. 

Besides  those  banished  persons  who  were  given  in  charge  of  Scot, 
the  following  were  delivered  to  Robert  Barclay,  governor  of  the  prov- 
ince, under  date  of  August  7,  1685,  o"^  condition  they  should  be  trans^ 
ported  to  East  New  Jersey:  George  Young,  John  Campbell,  John 
Swan,  James  Oliver,  James  Stuart,  John  Jackson,  John  Gibb,  Gilbert 
Ferguson,  Colin  Campbell,  John  Gilliland,  Thomas  Richard,  William 
Drennan,  William  Mcllroy,  Archibald  Jamieson,  John  McKello,  Alex- 
ander Graham,  Ducan  McEwen,  Malcolm  Black,  John  McAulin,  Donald 
Moor  and  John  Nicol.  There  is  little  doubt  that  all  of  these  were 
among  the  passengers  on  the  "Henry  and  Francis."  It  is  difficult  to 
tell  how  many  of  those  who  came  on  the  vessel  became  permanent 
settlers  in  the  vicinity  of  Perth.  A  few  settled  in  Woodbridge,  others 
removed  to  New  England,  others  returned  to  Scotland.  John  Frazer, 
a  candidate  for  the  ministry,  did  not  long  remain  in  New  Jersey;  he 
removed  to  Connecticut,  but  on  the  accession  of  William  and  Mary  to 
the  throne  of  England,  returned  to  Scotland.  William  Jackson,  a  cord- 
wainer.  removed  to  New  York ;  William  Niven  subsequently  returned 
to  Scotland.     Of  Christopher  Strang  and  Rev.  David  Simson  there  is 


PERTH  AMBOY  373 

little  known.  John  Doby,  Robert  Hardie,  John  Forbes,  and  John  Cock- 
burn  became  residents  of  the  settlement  in  1684.  Cockburn  was  a  ma- 
son; Forbes  settled  on  a  plantation  on  Cedar  brook  now  in  Raritan 
township.  John  Emott  came  to  the  province  before  the  purchase  by 
the  twenty-four  proprietaries.  He  was  landlord  of  the  Long  Ferry 
Tavern,  the  first  public  house  in  Amboy,  in  1685,  secretary  of  the 
province  in  that  year,  a  lieutenant  in  the  Amboy  militia,  also  clerk  of 
the  county  court  and  court  of  sessions.  John  Gibb  and  David  Jamison 
were  especially  noted  for  being  leaders  in  Scotland  of  a  society  entitled 
"Sweet  Singers."  The  fate  of  the  former  is  not  known ;  the  latter  served 
as  clerk  to  the  council,  and  Governor  Hunter  selected  him  to  be  Chief 
Justice  of  New  Jersey  on  account  of  his  legal  abilities.  Although  a 
resident  of  New  York,  he  continued  to  fill  the  office  of  Chief  Justice 
until  1723,  when  on  the  ground  of  inconvenience  attendant  on  his  non- 
residence,  he  was  superseded  in  the  office  by  William  Trent. 

John  Barclay,  a  brother  of  the  governor,  became  a  resident  of  Amboy 
about  1688.  He  held  many  public  offices,  and  was  for  many  years  clerk 
of  St.  Peter's  Church.  His  residence  was  an  old  brick  building,  on  what 
is  now  High  street,  near  the  square.  David,  another  brother  of  the  gov- 
ernor, died  at  sea  in  August,  1685,  on  his  return  to  East  Jersey  from 
Aberdeen,  Scotland.  Among  the  other  residents  of  Amboy  at  this  time 
were :  John  Loofborrow,  a  miller ;  Benjamin  Griffith,  afterwards  a  com- 
missioner in  the  minor  courts;  John  Watson,  a  merchant;  Peter  Wat- 
son, a  planter ;  Thomas  Knowles,  a  stationer ;  and  Robert  Bridgeman,  a 
merchant.  Two  brothers,  Stephen  and  Thomas  Wame,  came  in  1683; 
the  latter  was  a  carpenter  and  eventually  settled  in  Monmouth  county. 
Thomas  and  Robert  Fullerton,  brothers  of  the  Laird  of  Kennaber,  located 
on  Cedar  brook,  eight  miles  west  of  Amboy.  John  Reid,  who  became 
surveyor  of  the  province,  came  in  1683,  residing  at  Amboy  for  some  years 
but  finally  removed  to  Monmouth  county.  Miles  Forster's  name  appears 
in  the  Provincial  records  in  1684;  he  owned  several  lots  in  Amboy,  and 
resided  there  for  many  years  before  his  death  in  1710.  He  received  from 
the  Board  of  Proprietors  in  December,  1702,  a  town  lot  on  consideration 
of  his  having  built  the  first  sloop  launched  at  Amboy.  Among  the  most 
valued  residents  of  Amboy  for  some  years  was  David  Mudie,  who  arrived 
in  East  Jersey  with  four  children  and  thirteen  servants  in  November, 
1684.  This  was,  however,  only  a  portion  of  his  family,  as  he  left  a  wife 
and  several  children  in  Scotland.  He  was  styled  "Merchant  of  Perth," 
and  was  judge  of  the  Court  of  Common  Right.  He  revisited  his  native 
land  in  1686,  but  soon  after  returned  to  the  province  and  continued  a 
resident  of  Amboy  until  his  death  in  March,  1696.  John  Johnstone,  a 
druggist  in  Edinburgh,  and  one  of  the  company  of  the  ill-fated  "Henry 
and  Francis,"  arrived  in  East  Jersey  in  December,  1685.    The  responsi- 


374  MIDDLESEX 

bility  of  the  ship's  company  after  the  death  of  Scot  fell  upon  his  shoul- 
ders, as  he  was  recognized  as  the  son-in-law  of  the  promoter  of  the 
enterprise.  He  was  known  as  Doctor  Johnstone;  after  a  residence  in 
New  York  he  removed  before  1707  to  Amboy.  He  resided  in  a  double 
two-story  brick  house  with  large  barn  and  other  outhouses,  to  which  was 
attached  a  spacious  garden  and  a  fine  orchard;  later  this  house  was 
refitted  and  became  known  as  Edinborough  Castle.  In  his  profession 
Dr.  Johnstone  was  considered  skillful ;  he  was  well  known  for  his 
charity  and  estimable  character.  George  Willocks,  inheriting  property 
in  East  Jersey  from  his  brother  James  Willocks,  a  doctor  of  medicine 
in  Kenny,  Scotland,  arrived  in  the  province  in  1684;  he  returned  to 
Scotland  and  in  1698  became  a  resident  of  Amboy,  and  was  deputy 
surveyor  of  the  province  under  John  Reid.  After  a  residence  in  various 
other  localities,  he  returned  in  1726  to  Amboy,  where  he  died  in  January 
or  February,  1729.  His  house  was  on  the  present  site  of  St.  Peter's 
Church  and  cemetery,  and  after  his  death  it  was  used  for  many  years  as 
a  parsonage. 

David  Lyell,  a  goldsmith  by  trade,  became  a  proprietor  in  April, 
1697,  and  came  to  New  Jersey  at  the  beginning  of  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury. He  resided  part  of  his  life  in  New  York  and  Monmouth  county, 
but  had  a  permanent  residence  in  Amboy,  his  house  standing  directly 
upon  the  shore  of  the  harbor,  a  short  distance  north  of  the  Episcopal 
church.  It  was  in  1716  that  Michael  Kearny  purchased  a  lot  of  ground 
in  Amboy  on  the  hill  south  of  St.  Peter's  Church.  He  was  originally 
from  Ireland,  and  married  a  daughter  of  Governor  Lewis  Morris.  His 
son,  Philip  Kearny.,  became  eminent  as  a  lawyer,  and  was  great-grand- 
father of  General  Philip  Kearny,  of  Civil  War  fame.  Thomas  Farmar 
removed  from  Richmond  county,  Staten  Island,  to  Amboy  in  171 1 ; 
he  filled  many  judicial  positions.  Among  the  most  influential  families 
of  ancient  Amboy  were  the  descendants  of  Rev.  William  Skinner,  a 
member  of  the  clan  of  MacGregor.  He  became  rector  of  St.  Peter's 
Church  in  1724,  and  continued  to  discharge  his  duties  faithfully  until 
his  death  in  1758.  Cortlandt,  his  eldest  son,  became  a  noted  lawyer, 
and  was  a  pronounced  royalist  during  the  Revolutionary  War,  receiv- 
ing a  commission  as  brigadier-general  from  General  Howe,  of  the  British 
forces.  His  house  of  stone  and  brick  stood  on  the  southwest  corner  of 
South  and  Water  streets,  the  gardens  extending  along  Smith  street  to 
what  is  now  Rector  street.  After  the  Revolution  he  went  to  England, 
where  he  died  March  15,  1799.  The  other  sons  of  the  Rev.  William 
Skinner  namely,  Stephen,  William  and  John,  were  all  royalists;  the 
firstnamed  resided  in  a  mansion  on  the  north  side  of  Smith  street,  which 
was  entirely  destroyed  by  fire  on  December  28,  1776.  The  youngest  son, 
John,  returned  to  Perth  Amboy  after  the  Revolutionary  War  and  en- 
gaged in  mercantile  business,  and  died  in   December,    1797.     Samuel 


PERTH  AMBOY  375 

Neville,  a  lawyer  by  profession,  established  himself  in  Perth  Amboy  in 
May,  1736.  He  was  a  man  of  education  and  literary  attainments ;  had  been 
editor  of  the  "London  Morning  Post."  He  soon  gained  eminence  in  his 
new  home,  became  judge  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  mayor  of 
Perth  Amboy,  and  second  judge  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  province. 
He  died  October  27,  1764,  leaving  a  name  unsullied  by  the  slightest 
stain.  He  resided  on  a  farm  at  the  termination  of  Market  street.  The 
name  of  Barberie  first  appears  on  the  records  of  Amboy  in  1702;  its 
representative  was  one  of  the  many  thousands  of  Protestants  who  left 
France  to  escape  the  evils  imposed  upon  them  by  Louis  XIV.  John 
Barberie,  a  descendant  of  the  original  settler,  was  Collector  of  Customs 
for  the  port  of  Perth  Amboy  at  the  time  of  his  death  in  1770.  John 
Watson  and  the  Parker  family  have  already  received  notice  in  this  work. 

There  seems  to  be  no  special  local  government  established  in  the 
early  days  of  Perth  Amboy,  for  its  simple  appellation  of  Perth  was 
soon  lost  from  joining  with  it  the  name  of  the  point  Ambo.  The  officers 
of  the  county  and  courts  preserved  order  and  regulated  its  police.  Its 
existence  as  a  town,  however,  was  soon  recognized,  as  one  or  more 
representatives  were  admitted  to  the  General  Assembly,  which  held 
its  first  session  in  1686  at  Amboy.  The  number  was  finally  fixed  at 
two  members  and  that  number  continued  to  be  its  quota  until  the 
Revolution. 

The  first  charter  of  incorporation  was  obtained  from  Governor  Hun- 
ter, August  24,  1718;  the  title  adopted  was  "The  Mayor,  Recorder, 
Aldermen  and  Commonalty  of  the  City  of  Perth  Amboy."  The  names 
of  John  Johnstone,  Thomas  Gordon,  John  Hamilton,  George  Willocks, 
John  Barclay,  William  Eier,  John  Stevens,  William  Hodgson,  William 
Frost,  Henry  Berry,  John  Sharp,  Thomas  Turnhill,  Andrew  Redford 
and  Alexander  Walker  appear  in  its  preamble  as  petitioners.  The 
common  council,  of  which  the  mayor  and  three  aldermen  constituted  a 
quorum,  were  to  hold  their  meetings  in  the  court  house  or  city  hall ;  their 
laws  and  ordinances  were  to  be  submitted  to  the  governor  for  his 
approval,  and  if  they  did  not  receive  his  approbation,  their  operation 
was  limited  to  six  months.  The  appointment  and  election  of  the  offi- 
cials have  been  already  mentioned;  the  recorder  and  town  clerk  held 
office  indefinitely,  as  no  particular  term  was  specified.  The  assistant 
aldermen,  however,  were  not  chosen  until  it  was  known  who  were  to 
be  aldermen.  The  sergeant,  whose  particular  duty  was  to  carry  a  mace 
before  the  mayor,  was  appointed  by  the  chief  magistrate,  with  the 
approval  of  the  common  council.  If  the  overseers  of  the  poor  and  the 
constables  refused  to  take  the  oath  of  office  and  perform  their  respec- 
tive duties,  they  were  to  be  fined  five  pounds.  The  mayor,  recorder  and 
aldermen  constituted  the  city  court;  a  term  was  held  once  a  month  for 
actions  of  debt.    This  is  a  brief  sketch  of  the  municipal  machinery  that 


376  MIDDLESEX 

was  intended  and  expected  to  work  a  great  revolution  in  the  circum- 
stances of  the  city,  to  add  to  its  population,  increase  its  dimensions  and 
improve  its  commerce. 

The  following  were  instructed  and  named  in  the  charter  to  perform 
the  first  official  stations:  William  Eier,  mayor  and  clerk  of  market; 
James  Alexander,  recorder;  John  Parker,  John  Rudyard,  Samuel  Leon- 
ard, William  Hodgson,  aldermen;  John  Brown,  Andrew  Redford, 
Michael  Henry,  Jacob  Isleton,  assistants;  John  Stevens,  chamberlain 
and  treasurer;  John  Barclay,  town  clerk;  John  Harrison,  sheriff  and 
water  bailiff;  William  Harrison,  coroner;  William  Frost,  marshal  or 
sergeant  of  the  mace ;  John  Ireland,  Henry  Berry,  overseers  of  the  poor ; 
John  Herriott,  Fred  Buckaloo,  Alexander  Cairns,  constables.  There  are 
no  records  of  the  city  extant  from  which  a  list  could  be  made  of  those 
who  subsequently  held  these  offices.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts  to 
boom  the  city,  no  perceptible  growth  was  obtained.  It  is  described  in 
1759  as  having  about  one  hundred  houses,  and  being  in  appearance, 
though  the  capital  of  the  province,  a  small  and  unpretentious  village. 
Smith,  in  his  "History  of  New  Jersey"  in  1765,  though  he  speaks  of  its 
pleasant  situation,  the  commodiousness  of  its  harbor,  states  that  the 
attempts  to  make  it  a  place  of  extensive  trade  had  not  materialized. 
The  city  was  at  its  pinnacle  of  fame  at  the  time  of  the  commencement 
of  the  Revolution ;  though  its  foreign  commerce  and  domestic  trade  had 
perhaps  been  greater  in  previous  years,  it  doubtlessly  had  a  larger 
population  than  at  any  time  before;  as  the  seat  of  government,  its 
importance  and  rank  was  greater  than  it  was  again  to  possess  for 
over  a  century.  The  struggle  for  independence  caused  many  of  its 
inhabitants  to  move,  and  the  operation  of  other  systems  of  government 
affected  its  commerce.  The  only  record  we  have  of  those  who  filled  the 
mayoralty  chair  before  the  Revolution  were  Samuel  Neville  in  1758,  and 
James  Parker,  the  elder,  in  1771. 

In  the  pre-Revolutionary  days,  the  question  of  travelling  facilities 
was  an  important  matter.  The  proprietaries,  ever  solicitous  for  the 
growth  of  the  capital,  expressed  a  wish  to  their  representative,  Deputy- 
Governor  Lawrie,  in  July,  1693,  that  a  convenient  road  should  be 
established  between  Perth  town  and  Burlington.  This  was  done  by 
Lawrie  the  following  year,  and  in  connection  with  the  road  he  operated 
a  ferry  boat  between  Amboy  and  New  York.  This  line  of  travel  was 
in  opposition  to  the  old  Dutch  road,  which  crossed  the  Raritan  river 
at  the  present  site  of  New  Brunswick.  The  latter  route  was  preferred 
by  travelers,  but  as  late  as  1698  there  was  no  public  conveyance  for 
the  transportation  of  either  goods  or  passengers  on  either  route.  The 
ferry  boat  which  Lawrie  established  takes  precedence  in  the  records  of 
all  but  one  established  under  the  proprietary  government.  In  1669  there 
was  established  a  ferry  at  Communipaw  for  the  accommodation  of  the 


PERTH  AMBOY  377 

people  of  Bergen  and  Communipaw  in  communicating  with  New  Amster- 
dam. The  proprietaries  in  December,  1700,  granted  for  fifteen  years 
to  Arthur  Simson  a  ferry  right  between  Amboy  and  Navesink.  These 
three  ferries,  with  the  one  across  the  Raritan  river  granted  to  John 
Inian  and  his  wife  in  1697,  are  all  that  are  mentioned  in  the  proprietary 
records.  The  Provincial  Assembly  in  1716  seems  to  have  paid  more 
attention  to  the  condition  of  public  roads.  An  act  was  passed  con- 
firming all  highways  that  were  six  and  four  rods  wide,  laid  out  in 
pursuance  of  previous  laws,  and  annulling  all  others.  Rates  of  ferriage 
were  established  by  public  ordinance;  about  this  time  there  were  in 
existence  a  ferry  from  Amboy  to  Staten  Island,  and  one  known  as 
Redford's  ferry  from  Perth  to  South  Amboy.  Passengers  and  produce 
were  also  transported  direct  from  South  Amboy  to  Staten  Island.  The 
ferries  from  Perth  Amboy  across  the  Raritan  and  the  Sound  were 
granted  in  1719  to  George  Willocks  and  his  wife.  In  1728  Gabriel  Stelle 
received  a  patent  for  a  ferry  from  South  Amboy  to  Staten  Island, 
touching  at  Perth  Amboy;  these  ferries  continued  to  be  of  essential 
service  until  the  introduction  of  steamboats  plying  between  New  Bruns- 
wick or  Amboy  to  New  York. 

The  first  advertisement  of  a  stage  route  between  Amboy  and  Bur- 
lington appeared  in  March,  1732-3,  in  which  Solomon  Smith  and  James 
Moore  of  Burlington  were  to  keep  two  stage  wagons  on  the  route, 
making  trips  once  a  week  for  the  transportation  of  passengers  and 
freight.  There  seems  to  be  no  opposition  to  this  line  of  stages  until 
October,  1750,  when  a  new  line  was  established  by  Daniel  O'Brien,  a 
resident  of  Perth  Amboy.  His  stage  boat  was  to  leave  New  York  every 
Wednesday  for  Amboy,  where  on  Friday  a  stage  wagon  would  proceed 
to  Bordentown,  where  another  stage  boat  would  convey  the  passengers 
to  Philadelphia.  The  success  of  this  line  led  to  an  opposition  in  1751, 
originating  in  Philadelphia.  A  boat  left  once  a  week  for  Burlington, 
whence  a  stage  conveyed  the  passengers  to  Amboy  Ferry,  where  a  boat 
commanded  by  Matthew  Iseltine  received  the  passengers  for  New 
York.  This  boat  is  described  as  having  a  commodious  cabin,  fitted 
up  with  a  tea  table  and  other  conveniences ;  they  promised  to  make  the . 
journey  in  twenty-four  or  thirty  hours,  less  time  than  the  competing  line ; 
it,  however,  required  the  same  number  of  days  as  O'Brien's  line.  In 
June,  1753,  Abraham  Webb  made  his  appearance  with  a  boat  "exceed- 
ingly well  fitted  with  a  handsome  cabin  and  all  necessary  accommoda- 
tions." He  probably  took  the  place  of  O'Brien  on  the  line ;  for  the  next 
year  the  latter  had  two  boats  leaving  New  York  for  Amboy  on  Mondays 
and  Thursdays,  unconnected  with  any  special  through  routes,  as  he 
offered  to  forward  merchandise  via  Burlington  or  Bordentown  as  parties 
might  choose,  both  lines  meeting  at  Amboy.  John  Butler  in  November, 
1756,  instituted  a  New  York  stage  via  Perth  Amboy  and  Trenton,  to 


378  MIDDLESEX 

make  the  journey  in  three  days  to  Philadelphia.  The  establishment  of 
rival  stage  routes  from  New  York  by  the  way  of  New  Brunswick  to 
Philadelphia  in  1765-66  put  an  end  to  the  traveling  by  way  of  Amboy; 
the  packets,  however,  continued  to  run  for  the  transportation  of  way 
passengers  and  merchandise,  but  less  numerous  until  about  i775&gt;  when 
there  was  "but  one  sailing  between  Amboy  and  New  York,  commanded 
by  Captain  John  Thompson. 

A  post  office  was  established  at  Amboy  in  1793,  John  Thompson 
■  receiving  the  first  appointment  as  postmaster.  The  mail  was  brought 
three  times  a  week  from  Woodbridge,  that  town  being  on  the  main 
route  between  New  York  and  Philadelphia.  This  arrangement  con- 
tinued until  1825.  when  the  mail  arrived  daily  with  the  exception ,  of 
Sunday  during  the  summer,  and  three  times  a  week  in  the  winter  season ; 
in  1830  another  change  was  made,  mails  being  received  and  departing 
daily.  Among  the  early  postmasters  were  Edward  John  Ball,  Joseph 
Golding,  George  Wright,  Robert  Rattone,  Simeon  Drake,  Robert  Arnold, 
Lewis  Golding,  James  Harriott,  Benjamin  F.  Arnold,  W.  S.  Russ,  John 
Manning,  R.  P.  Barton,  John  F.  Ten  Broeck,  John  Tomlinson,  Elam 
Sanford,  John  Fothergill,  George  H.  Tice,  Cornelius  Convery,  George 
H.  Tice,  William  Pfeifier  and  Richard  F.  White.  The  present  post 
office  was  erected  on  the  corner  of  Maple  and  Jefferson  streets  by 
the  United  States  Government  (1909),  with  accommodation  for  the 
Post  Office  Department,  and  the  Collector  of  the  Port.  The  estimated 
cost  was  about  $30,000.  About  the  same  time  rural  delivery  routes 
were  established,  and  are  still  maintained  on  the  roads  leading  to  Fords 
and  Metuchen.    Free  delivery  went  into  operation  in  1901. 

The  advantages  of  obtaining  an  education  under  the  proprietary 
government  were  very  limited.  It  is  true  that  under  legislation  passed 
in  1693  the  inhabitants  of  any  town  could  choose  three  men  to  make  a 
taxable  rate  and  fix  the  salary  of  a  schoolmaster;  and  ten  years  later 
three  men  were  to  be  elected  annually,  and  appoint  places  where  schools 
should  be  kept.  There  is,  however,  no  information  extant  concerning 
the  character  of  instruction  meted  out  to  the  young  of  Amboy  and  its 
vicinity.  The  period  under  the  royal  governors  seems  not  to  have  been 
favorable  either  for  education  or  a  general  diffusion  of  intelligence 
among  the  people. 

The  records  show  of  the  existence  of  a  school  in  connection  with 
St.  Peter's  Church  in  July,  1765.  The  Rev.  Mr.  McKean,  the  rector, 
informed  the  vestry  that  the  school  could  not  be  longer  held  in  the 
barracks  without  paying  rent.  Subscriptions  were  immediately  obtained ; 
in  April,  1768,  a  house  was  hired  for  a  school,  which  was  commenced  by 
Mr.  McNaughton.  The  schoolteacher  was  an  Irishman  of  dark  com- 
plexion. The  building  was  located  near  the  gully  that  divided  the 
church  green  from  the  building.    This  school  was  discontinued  in  May, 


PERTH  AMBOY  379 

1770,  and  three  years  later  a  school  fund  was  gbtained  by  subscription. 
In  July,  1774,  Thomas  Johnston  was  secured  as  master,  and  a  school 
was  opened  in  the  court  house.  After  the  Revolution,  matters  were  in 
much  the  same  condition  until  the  adoption  of  the  improved  system  of 
State  education. 

The  seat  of  government  of  the  province  and  residence  of  the  principal 
royal  officers  made  Perth  Amboy  at  the  commencement  of  the  War  of 
Independence  a  place  of  interest  to  both  of  the  conflicting  parties.  Men- 
tion has  already  been  made  in  the  chapter  on  the  Revolutionary  period, 
of  the  British  troops  that  formed  the  garrison  at  Perth  Amboy  before 
the  opening  of  hostilities.  The  organization  of  two  New  Jersey  pro- 
vincial regiments  in  December,  1775,  aroused  in  the  early  part  of  the 
following  year  the  patriotic  spirit  of  the  boys  of  the  ancient  capital. 
They  formed  a  company  of  volunteers  under  the  name  of  '"The  Gov- 
ernor's Guard."  The  captain  of  this  redoubtable  company  was  Lambert 
Barberrie;  the  lieutenant,  John  Skinner;  the  ensign,  Andrew  Smyth. 
The  company  proved  at  a  later  period  a  serviceable  auxiliary  to  the 
American  officers  by  watching  sentinels  and  guards,  reporting  any 
observed  failure  in  duty  or  discipline. 

Towards  the  end  of  June,  1776,  Sir  William  Howe  arrived  at  Staten 
Island  with  a  large  body  of  troops  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  inter- 
course between  the  Eastern  and  Middle  States.  This  movement  led 
General  Washington  to  form  a  camp  at  Amboy,  which  he  placed  under 
the  command  of  General  Hugh  Mercer.  It  was  about  this  time  that  a 
British  brig-of-war  entered  the  harbor  and  anchored  off  St.  Peter's 
Church.  The  Americans  obtaining  an  eighteen  pounder  gun,  placed  it 
behind  breastworks  near  the  church,  and  opened  fire  on  the  vessel.  The 
British  ship  promptly  replied,  but  soon  heaved  anchor  and  sailed  away. 
There  were  in  August,  1776,  fifteen  hundred  American  troops  stationed 
at  Amboy.  General  Mercer,  on  the  night  of  October  16,  1776,  passed 
over  with  a  body  of  troops  to  Staten  Island  with  the  object  of  capturing 
a  force  of  British  soldiers  stationed  in  the  vicinity  of  Richmond,  but 
little  was  accomplished.  Washington's  retreat  through  New  Jersey 
commenced  in  November,  1776,  and  the  British  concentrated  their  forces 
upon  New  Brunswick  and  Amboy,  relinquishing  all  the  advantages  they 
had  gained,  excepting  the  retention  of  these  two  places.  Washington, 
having  wintered  his  army  at  Morristown,  towards  the  end  of  May, 
1777,  advanced  upon  New  Brunswick,  from  which  place  General  Howe 
marched  on  the  14th  of  June  to  take  the  field  against  him.  The  British 
commander  gained  no  advantage  over  the  American  army,  and  retired 
again  to  New  Brunswick.  A  general  retreat  was  commenced  June  22, 
1777,  the  British  forces  leaving  New  Brunswick  for  Amboy.  The 
harbor  was  filled  with  British  vessels  on  which  troops  were  embarked, 
the  transports  sailing  to  Chesapeake  Bay.     The  Americans  remained 


38o  MIDDLESEX 

in  undisturbed  possession  of  Amboy  during  the  remainder  of  the  war. 
After  this  period  of  activity,  the  revolutionary  history  of  the  city  pre- 
sents little  interest  and  nothing  of  importance. 

At  the  opening  of  the  last  century,  Perth  Amboy's  civil  government 
wras  conducted  under  a  second  charter,  which  passed  the  legislature 
December  21,  1784,  and  remained  the  law  of  the  land  unimpaired  by 
amendment  until  1844.  From  minutes  of  a  meeting  of  the  citizens, 
November  12,  1785,  at  the  court  house,  it  appears  that  James  Parker 
was  mayor,  but,  under  the  impression  that  he  would  not  be  eligible  for 
reappointment,  the  name  of  Thomas  Farmar  was  presented  to  the 
legislature  then  in  session  at  Trenton  for  the  office,  as  the  appointment 
of  mayor  came  from  that  body.  There  is  no  record  of  the  city  officers 
existing  from  which  a  perfect  list  can  be  obtained.  According  to  census 
returns  of  1810,  the  first  which  gave  the  enumerations  by  cities  and 
towns,  Perth  Amboy  had  358  white  males,  372  white  females,  all  free 
persons  36,  slaves  49,  a  total  of  815;  it  was  not,  however,  until  the 
census  of  1840  that  the  item  of  slaves  disappeared  in  the  enumeration. 
In  that  year  there  were  587  white  males,  678  white  females,  38  free 
colored,  a  total  of  1,303. 

There  are  some  fragmentary  memoranda  of  the  city  records  in 
existence  since  1831.  They  are,  however,  and  unfortunately,  very  incom- 
plete. The  council  met  February  28,  1831,  at  the  house  of  Martin 
Chandler;  the  mayor  at  this  time  was  James  Parker.  At  this  meeting 
a  book  of  minutes  was  procured  and  some  semblance  of  a  record  was 
commenced.  The  following  year,  James  Parker  still  occupied  the 
mayoralty  chair.  The  danger  of  cholera  then  prevailing  in  the  States 
caused  the  appointment  of  Dr.  Charles  McKnight  Smith  as  health 
officer.  At  a  subsequent  meeting  this  officer  reported  that  all  necessary 
precautions  had  been  taken  and  that  all  cases  of  the  disease  had  been 
confined  to  the  localities  where  they  originated.  James  Marsh  became 
mayor  in  1834,  and  at  a  council  meeting  held  May  20,  1835,  a  resolution 
was  adopted  to  lay  a  single  row  of  flagstones  in  the  center  of  Smith  and 
High  streets.  This  was  the  first  effort  towards  walk  improvements, 
but  unfortunately  the  resolution  was  rescinded  by  the  council  the  fol- 
lowing year.  On  application  of  sundry  citizens,  October  18,  1835,  the 
names  of  a  number  of  the  streets  were  changed.  There  seems  to  be 
a  hiatus  in  the  records  until  1844,  when  a  new  charter  was  granted  to 
the  city  by  the  legislature,  February  27th  of  that  year.  James  Harriot 
was  elected  mayor  in  1844  and  was  succeeded  the  following  year  by 
Francis  W.  Brinley.  The  mayor  for  1846  was  William  Paterson,  who 
after  holding  the  office  one  year,  gave  way  to  the  reelection  of  Francis 
W.  Brinley.  His  successor  was  Commodore  Lawrence  Kearny  in  1848; 
the  following  year  Dr.  Solomon  Andrews  was  occupant  of  the  chair, 
and  recorded  in  the  minutes  are  several  ordinances  for  street  improve-

ment.  The  next  mayor  (in  1850)  was  the  influential  citizen,  James 
Parker,  who  was  succeeded  the  following  year  by  Lewis  Compton.  The 
council,  December  17,  1851,  granted  a  lease  of  the  slip  at  the  foot  of 
Commerce  street  for  eighteen  years  to  David  Crowell  and  son.  Theo- 
dore F.  King  was  elected  mayor  in  1852,  and  at  an  annual  election  the 
following  year,  Dr.  Solomon  Andrews  was  elected  to  the  ofifice.  There 
were  four  special  town  meetings  held  during  his  term  of  ofifice,  one  to 
consider  the  charter  for  improvements  of  streets  and  sidewalks,  another 
to  raise  $S,ooo  to  facilitate  these  improvements ;  the  others  were  to 
consider  the  law  granting  ferry  privileges,  which  on  being  referred  to 
a  committee  advised  a  repeal  of  the  law.  The  ordinance  for  the  sup- 
pression of  vice  and  immorality  stands  on  the  minute  book  as  a  monu- 
ment to  the  city  council  of  1854,  Joseph  D.  Forbes  being  the  occupant 
of  the  mayoralty  chair.  Dr.  Solomon  Andrews  was  for  the  third  time 
elected  mayor  in  1855 ;  a  number  of  ordinances  for  improvements  were 
passed.  His  successor  was  William  Paterson;  the  year  is  noted  for 
granting  of  licenses,  this  being  the  issue  for  which  the  council  was 
elected.  In  the  year  1857  considerable  business  was  transacted  by  the 
council ;  the  mayor  was  Edward  J.  Hall.  The  slip  at  the  foot  of  Fayette 
street  was  leased  for  ten  years  to  Peter  R.  Hawley.  For  the  third  time 
William  Peterson  was  elected  mayor  in  1858,  and  reelected  for  the  fol- 
•  lowing  two  years.  The  sewer  on  Smith  street  was  commenced  in  1859, 
at  a  cost  of  $2,795.  The  second  term  of  Edward  J.  Hall  was  in  1861 ; 
general  business  of  importance  was  transacted.  In  the  election  of  1862, 
Joseph  L.  Crowell  was  chosen  mayor ;  he  resigned  in  October  of  that  year, 
enlisted,  and  went  to  the  war.  The  recorder,  John  R.  Watson,  acted 
as  mayor  until  the  election  in  1863  which  resulted  in  placing  in  the 
mayoralty  chair  Alfred  Hall,  who  continued  by  reelection  until  1869. 
In  this  period  were  the  busy  times  of  the  Civil  War.  The  city  was 
bonded  for  $4,800  to  pay  for  volunteers ;  a  tax  of  $10  was  imposed  on  all 
those  liable  to  a  draft;  the  council  was  authorized  to  pay  a  bounty 
of  $300  to  every  man  credited  on  the  call  for  three  hundred  thou- 
sand men,  the  quota  of  Perth  Amboy  being  thirty-five.  The  tax  was 
payable  May  i,  1865,  and  an  act  was  passed  by  the  legislature  authoriz- 
ing the  borrowing  of  $10,500.  The  slip  at  the  foot  of  Smith  street  was 
leased  in  1863  to  Messrs.  Drake  for  a  ferry.  The  charter  was  revised 
in  1865,  fifteen  sections  being  added,  principally  relating  to  street  im- 
provements. Streets  were  extended  to  the  suburbs.  Prospect  street  to 
Market  street,  also  High  street,  from  Washington  street  to  Crane 
creek.  Smith  street  was  laid  out  to  the  township  line  to  run  parallel 
with  Market  street ;  King  street  was  opened  from  Smith  to  Market 
streets ;  bulkheads  built  at  foot  of  Gordon  and  other  streets.  The  ferry 
slip  in  1867  was  leased  to  the  Staten  Island  Railroad  Company  for 
twenty  years      A  contract  was  awarded  July  15th  that  year  for  the 


382  MIDDLESEX 

erection  of  twenty-five  street  lamps  to- be  lighted  with  oil.  The  council 
of  1867  deemed  it  necessary  that  the  city  should  be  supplied  with  a 
clock;  on  March  16,  1869,  a  contract  was  awarded  to  A.  S.  Hotchkiss 
&amp;  Company  at  an  expense  not  to  exceed  seven  hundred  dollars.  For  the 
safety  of  the  city's  funds,  a  safe  was  purchased  in  1867  at  the  cost  of 
two  hundred  and  seventy-five  dollars. 

The  mayor  in  1869  was  James  M.  Chapman;  in  this  year  Water 
street  was  graded  and  shade  trees  set  out  from  Smith  street  to  Fayette 
street.  The  city  park  fence  and  chains  were  reset.  The  council  by 
resolution  adopted  a  memorial  to  the  memory  of  Lewis  Golding,  late 
treasurer  of  the  city,  who  had  for  thirty-nine  years  been  connected  with 
the  city  government.  The  charter  was  revised  March  17,  1870,  and  the 
council  started  out  anew  under  its  workings;  Joseph  L.  Crowell  was 
the  mayor  elected  for  two  years.  The  board  of  education  Was  organized, 
the  school  enlarged,  a  lot  purchased  for  the  erection  of  a  new  school 
house,  for  which  bonds  were  issued.  Sixteen  additional  street  lamps 
were  erected,  and  a  contract  awarded  for  the  building  of  a  jail  at  an 
expense  not  to  exceed  $1,150.  A  map  commission  was  appointed  to 
survey  the  city  and  make  a  map  with  street  and  sidewalk  improvements. 
The  expediency  of  building  an  almshouse  was  agitated  at  council 
meetings  in  1871.  On  being  referred  to  a  committee,  they  reported 
that  the  matter  should  be  deferred  only  a  short  time.  The  police  force 
was  increased  to  two,  and  a  committee  was  appointed  to  examine  plans 
for  the  rebuilding  of  the  city  hall.  This  improvement  was  completed 
and  the  new  city  hall  dedicated  October  15,  1872,  the  city  being  bonded 
for  $16,000  for  building  and  furniture.  At  the  dedication  ceremonies, 
John  G.  Garretson,  having  been  elected  mayor  in  1872  for  two  years, 
presided. 

The  following  have  filled  the  mayoralty  chair  since:  John  G.  Gar- 
retson, 1882-86;  James*  Growney,  acting-mayor,  1887-88;  Thomas  Arm- 
strong, 1888-90;  E.  R.  Pierce,  1890-93 ;  Edward  W.  Barnes,  1894-95;  Ira 
B.  Tice,  1896-98;  James  L.  Compton,  1898-1900;  Adam  Eckert,  acting 
mayor,  1901 ;  Charles  K.  Seaman,  1902-1903 ;  H.  Martyn  Brace,  1904- 
1905;  John  Pfeiffer,  acting  mayor,  1906;  Albert  Bollschweiler,  1906-10; 
Wm.  D.  Voorhees,  acting  mayor,  191 1;  Ferd.  Garretson,  1912-16;  John 
F.  Ten  Broeck,  1917-18;  Frank  Dorsey,  1918-19;  William  C.  Wilson, 
1920. 

The  city  in  191 5  acquired  several  pieces  of  real  estate  which  they 
are  gradually  converting  into  attractive  parks.  The  largest  of  these 
is  Washington  Park,  fronting  on  New  Brunswick  avenue,  comprising 
several  acres.  Caledonian  Park,  named  in  honor  of  the  first  settlers  of 
the  town,  lies  at  the  foot  of  High  street,  overlooking  the  Bay.  Bay 
View,  foot  of  Market  street,  is  also  on  the  Bay,  opposite  Staten  Island. 

The  Perth  Amboy  Water  Company  was  organized  in  January,  1881, 
and  a  reservoir  was  built  at  Eagleyvood  Park  from  which  water  was 


PERTH  AM  BOY  383 

dispensed  throughout  the  city,  the  fire  pressure  being  over  forty-two 
pounds.  The  capital  stock  was  $100,000,  and  among  the  first  officers 
were  William  Hall,  president;  C.  C.  Hommann,  secretary;  William 
Stiger,  treasurer.  The  water  works  of  the  city  are  now  under  the 
control  of  a  Board  of  Water  Commissioners.  The  Perth  Amboy  Gas 
Company  was  incorporated  March  8,  1861,  with  a  capital  of  $65,000, 
which  was  all  paid  in  at  that  time.  A  contract  was  obtained  for  lighting 
the  streets,  and  pipes  were  laid  to  supply  the  city  and  private  demands. 
The  corporation  is  now  known  by  the  title  of  Perth  Amboy  Gas  Light 
Company,  its  officers  being  Patrick  Convery,  president ;  Albert  F.  Reite- 
meyer,  secretary  and  treasurer. 

,  The  city  has  nine  Fire  Companies,  which  are  said  to  be  as  efficient 
as  any  in  the  State.  The  quickness  with  which  they  answer  the  fire 
alarm,  and  the  promptness  with  which  they  reach  the  scene  of  action 
are  matters  of  public  knowledge.  The  names  and  dates  of  organization 
of  these  companies,  which  are  all  volunteer  bodies,  are  as  follows :' 
Lincoln  Hose,  December  28,  1881 ;  Protection  Hook  and  Ladder,  Janu- 
ary, 1882;  Washington  Hose,  December,  1882;  McClellan  Engine,  No. 
3,  February,  1892 ;  Eagle  Hose,  No.  4,  1904 ;  Garfield  Engine,  No.  5,  1908 ; 
Liberty  Hook  and  Ladder,  No.  2,  December  2,  1909;  Humane  H.  and  L. 
Chemical,  1913.  Joseph  Conard,  the  first  chief,  was  elected  in  1883. 
The  following  are  present  officers :  Chief,  George  Nixon ;  first  assistant, 
Harry  Tooker ;  second  assistant,  Andrew  Anderson. 

The  Free  Public  Library  was  established  in  1892,  and  was  formerly 
located  in  High  street.  In  1902  a  donation  of  $20,000  was  received  from 
the  Carnegie  Foundation,  and  the  present  building  on  Jefferson  street 
was  erected;  in  1914  a  further  gift  of  $30,000,  from  the  same  source, 
provided  for  a  substantial  enlargement  of  the  building.  The  library 
hours  are  daily  (legal  holidays  excepted)  from  9  a.  m.  to  9  p.  m.,  Sun- 
days (October  to  June),  2  to  6  p.  m.,  for  readers  only.  According  to 
the  last  report  there  were  14,496  volumes,  and  a  large  number  of  peri- 
odicals, magazines,  etc.  A  branch  library  is  conducted  in  Brace  avenue, 
which  is  also  open  daily.  There  is  a  separate  reading  room  for  the 
children,  in  which  there  is  an  average  daily  attendance  of  about  125. 
A  large  auditorium  in  the  basement  is  a  well  lighted,  and  attractive  room, 
and  used  for  club  meetings,  lectures,  plays  and  other  gatherings.  Miss 
Alice  Goddard,  who  was  the  efficient  librarian,  was  granted  an  extended 
leave  of  absence  in  June,  1918,  to  engage  in  war  work  in  France,  and 
was  succeeded  by  Miss  Helen  M.  Grannis,  who  is  still  in  charge,  with 
an  excellent  staff  of  assistants.  The  board  of  trustees  is  as  follows: 
F.  L.  Antisell,  president;  Tracy  D.  Waring,  vice-president;  John  H. 
Miller,  secretary;  Albert  Leon,  treasurer;  J.  L.  Clevenger,  William  C. 
Wilson,  mayor,  ex-officio;  and  S.  E.  Shull,  superintendent  of  schools, 
ex-officio. .

Some  fifteen  or  twenty  citizens  in  191 5  organized  the  East  Jersey- 
Club,  the  first  meetings  being  held  at  the  Packer  House.  A  year  or 
two  afterward  the  club  leased  the  property  of  Dr.  F.  W.  Kitchel,  on 
High  street,  and  subsequently  purchased  it.  The  membership  increased 
from  year  to  year,  and  at  present  numbers  one  hundred  and  thirty  resi- 
dent, and  sixty  non-resident  members.  The  members  have  always  taken 
an  active  and  effective  interest  in  social  and  city  affairs,  many  of  them 
being  connected  officially  and  otherwise  with  a  number  of  the  leading 
business  enterprises.  The  officers  and  directors  are:  L.  H.  McHose, 
president;  Franz  Roessler,  vice-president;  John  M.  O'Toole,  treasurer; 
Jean  DuBois,  Dr.  Wm.  E.  Ramsay,  C.  C.  Baldwin,  A.  Clayton  Clark, 
Abel  Hansen,  R.  A.  McDowell,  H.  W.  Fisher,  Dr.  J.  L.  McDowall,  and 
J.  F.  McGuire.  The  clubhouse  was  originally  erected  in  1667,  and  was 
thoroughly  renovated  and  partially  rebuilt  by  the  late  owner. 

The  financial  history  of  Perth  Amboy  dates  back  to  1872,  when 
a  number  of  business  men  met  for  the  purpose  of  arranging  for  estab- 
lishment of  a  banking  institution  for  the  purpose  of  handling  mercantile 
paper.  This  was  deemed  a  matter  of  great  importance,  as  heretofore 
much  of  the  moneyed  interest  of  the  city  was  withdrawn  into  other  chan- 
nels, and  difficulty  had  arisen  in  obtaining  discount  of  business  paper 
without  resorting  to  banking  institutions  of  New  Brunswick  or  Rahway. 

The  Middlesex  County  State  Bank  was  incorporated  March  14,  1872, 
with  a  capital  of  $35,000.  The  first  board  of  directors  were  William 
Hall,  president;  William  King,  Uriah  B.  Watson,  Noah  Furman,  R.  N. 
Valentine  and  Eber  B.  Hall.  The  bank  for  a  number  of  years  did  a 
successful  business,  but  was  obliged  to  close  its  doors,  and  went  into 
liquidation  in  1899 

The  Perth  Amboy  Savings  Institution  was  incorporated  under  the 
laws  of  the  State,  July  i,  1869.  The  deposits  the  first  year  amounted 
to  $1,969.32;  they  have  grown  steadily  and  under  good  management 
represent  a  total  savings  of  $2,700,000.  The  institution  built  a  few  years 
ago  their  present  fireproof  banking  building  on  Smith  street.  The  pres- 
ent assets  of  the  bank  are  invested  in  first  mortgages  on  real  estate, 
United  States  bonds  and  certificates,  county,  municipal  and  railroad 
bonds.  The  present  officers  are:  Adrian  Lyon,  president;  Victor  W. 
Main,  vice-president ;  J.  Lawrence  Boggs,  secretary ;  Charles  Keen  Sea- 
man, treasurer. 

The  oldest  institution  and  in  fact  the  first  organized  under  the  Na- 
tional Banking  Law  in  the  city  is  the  First  National  Bank,  located  on 
Smith  street.  It  was  organized  July  25,  1899,  with  a  capital  stock  of 
$100,000,  the  incorporators  being  Amos  T.  French,  John  A.  Waterbury, 
R.  B.  Van  Cortlandt,  A.  F.  Reitemeyer,  John  W.  Whelan,  John  Kean, 
Hamilton  F.  Kean,  Edward  Nugent,  Benjamin  F.  Howell  and  Robert 
Carson.    In  the  financial  statement  issued  by  the  bank  February  21,  1921,

the  surplus  earnings  are  stated  to  be  $277,845-60,  while  the  individual 
deposits  aggregated  $3,021,536.62.  The  present  oflScers  are:  Hamilton 
F.  Kean,  president;  Robert  Carson  and  Charles  D.  Snedeker,  vice- 
presidents  ;  John  M.  O'Toole,  cashier. 

The  City  National  Bank,  a  comparatively  young  institution,  was 
incorporated  and  commenced  business  September  22,  19 19,  with  a 
capital  stock  of  $100,000.  By  the  last  financial  statement  the  surplus 
amounted  to  $25,000,  besides  undivided  profits  of  $8,731.95;  the  individ- 
ual deposits  amounted  to  $717,479.51.  The  officers  in  1921  were  Joseph 
E.  Strieker,  president ;  John  Pfeiffer,  vice-president ;  E.  C.  Axtell,  cashier. 

There  are  besides  these  financial  institutions  in  Perth  Amboy,  two 
trust  companies.  The  Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company  is  situated  on  the 
corner  of  Smith  and  Hobart  streets.  The  officers  are  Isaac  Alpern, 
president;  Frank  Dorsey  and  Peter  C.  Olsen,  vice-presidents;  William 
M.  Weiant,  secretary  and  treasurer.  The  history  of  the  Raritan  Trust 
Company,  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  dates  from  June  6,  1916,  when 
the  institution  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  New 
Jersey  with  a  capital  stock  of  $100,000.  The  company  is  owned  and  con- 
trolled by  residents  of  Perth  Amboy  and  vicinity,  and  the  degree  to 
which  the  public  confidence  is  held  is  shown  by  a  gratifying  annual 
increase  in  the  business  of  all  its  departments.  The  Raritan  Trust  Com- 
pany performs  all  the  service  of  the  modern  trust  company,  and,  in  addi- 
tion to  its  banking  business,  has  come  into  that  intimate  touch  with  the 
community  that  such  an  institution,  through  the  very  nature  of  its  organ- 
ization, can  best  attain. 

There  have  been  only  a  few  minor  changes  in  the  official  personnel 
of  the  company  during  the  four  years  of  its  life,  and  its  place  of  business 
(1920)  continues  on  the  comer  of  State  and  Fayette  streets.  The  state- 
ment prepared  at  the  close  of  business,  December  31,  1920,  showed 
deposits  of  well  over  a  million  and  a  half  dollars,  and  all  its  items  indicate 
a  healthy  growth  and  vigorous  condition.  The  officers  of  the  Raritan 
Trust  Company  are:  Sidney  Riddlestorffer,  president;  A.  Greenbaum, 
vice-president;  Abel  Hansen,  vice-president;  A.  Clayton  Qark,  vice- 
president;  W.  Parker  Runyon,  vice-president;  Harry  E.  Comings,  sec- 
retary-treasurer ;  and  I.  R.  Solt,  assistant  secretary-treasurer.  The  direc- 
tors are :  A.  Clayton  Clark,  manager  of  the  Raritan  Copper  Works ;  Leo 
Goldberger,  city  attorney ;  M.  S.  Goldberger,  merchant ;  A.  Greenbaum, 
president  of  the  Metuchen  Realty  and  Improvement  Company;  Abel 
Hansen,  proprietor  of  Ford's  Porcelain  Works;  M.  M.  McHose,  treas- 
urer of  L.  H.  McHose,  Inc. ;  Anton  Massopust,  real  estate  and  insur- 
ance operator;  S.  Riddlestorffer,  president  of  the  company;  I.  R.  Rob- 
bins,  dealer  in  lumber  and  building  materials ;  L.  M.  Rossi,  works  man- 
ager of  the  General  Bakelite  Company ;  W.  Parker  Runyon,  president  of

the  P.  A.  Dry  Dock  Company;  Dr.  C.  I.  Silk,  physician;  Frank  Stas, 
treasurer  of  the  Slovak  League  of  America ;  and  Max  Wurtzel,  wholesale 
merchant.  The  company  has  found  a  wide  local  sphere  of  influence,  and 
has  taken  a  responsible  place  among  the  financial  institutions  of  the 
county. 

The  subscriptions  to  the  several  Liberty  Loans  throughout  the  city, 
including  the  banks  and  individual  subscriptions,  were  as  follows :  First 
loan,  $1,027,000;  Second,  $1,505,250;  Third,  $1,401,450;  Fourth, 
$1,798,300;  Fifth,  $1,340,750;  Total,  $7,072,750. 

A  Board  of  Trade  was  organized  and  duly  incorporated  in  1913.  The 
association  continued  its  labors  with  considerable  success  until  Sep- 
tember 13,  1920,  at  which  time  the  members  organized  themselves  into 
a  Chamber  of  Commerce,  after  a  vigorous  campaign  conducted  in  their 
behalf  by  the  "American  Board  for  Cities."  The  Chamber  now  has 
commodious  offices  on  the  corner  of  Smith  and  Maple  streets.  The  offi- 
cers are  as  follows :  President,  Isaac  Alpern ;  vice-presidents,  Fred  A. 
Briegs  and  P.  C.  Olsen;  treasurer,  John  Pfeiffer;  secretary,  John  F. 
Bergen ;  directors — Charles  C.  Hommann,  Ira  R.  Crouse,  John  Pfeiffer, 
Isaac  Alpem,  Fred  A.  Briegs,  George  F.  Reynolds,  Frank  Dorsey,  I.  T. 
Madsen,  Jean  Du  Bois  and  Barney  Streiff.  There  is  a  membership 
of  450,  and  much  active  and  successful  work  has  been  done  and  is  now 
prosecuted  for  the  growth  and  benefit  of  the  city.  Many  inducements 
are  being  offered  to  corporations  and  companies  to  locate  here,  and 
the  personnel  of  the  Chamber  is  such  as  to  warrant  the  expectation  that 
the  organization  will  be  productive  of  lasting  benefit  to  the  city  in  every 
respect. 

A  large  number  of  the  early  inhabitants  of  Perth  Amboy  were 
Quakers  and  Anabaptists,  and  many  belonged  to  the  Scotch  Kirk,  while 
in  the  adjacent  county  Congregationalists  or  Independents  were  numer- 
ous. This  diversity  of  sects  necessarily  rendered  it  difficult  to  procure 
a  clergyman  who  would  be  generally  acceptable,  and  fifteen  years 
elapsed  after  the  settlement  without  any  regular  religious  services. 
Several  of  the  East  Jersey  proprietors  applied  in  1695  to  Bishop  Compton 
of  London  for  a  minister  of  the  Established  Church.  In  compliance  with 
this  request,  at  the  close  of  1698  Rev.  Edward  Perthuck  was  sept  to 
the  province.  Arriving  at  Perth  Amboy,  the  board  of  proprietors 
ordered,  February  21,  1698-99,  that  one  of  the  houses  which  had  been 
built  at  the  expense  of  the  general  proprietaries  should  be  given  for  a 
church  for  the  use  of  the  town.  This  house  stood  near  the  ferry  over 
the  Raritan;  this  was  the  foundation  in  Amboy  of  the  congregation  of 
Protestant  Episcopalians. 

It  is  not  known  how  long  Mr.  Perthuck.  remained,  but  prior  to  the 
incorporation  of  the  Society  for  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel  in  For- 
eign Parts  in  1701,  .clergymen  occasionally  visited  Amboy.    The  follow- 


PERTH  AMBOY  387 

ing  year  Rev.  George  Keith  was  sent  by  the  society  as  a  missionary  to 
the  colonies,  having  as  his  assistant  Rev.  John  Talbot.  The  pulpit  was 
occupied  occasionally  in  1704  by  Rev.  Mr.  Brook,  a  missionary  at  Eliza- 
bethtown.  He  was  an  active,  energetic  and  efficient  servant  of  the  Cross, 
performing  divine  service  in  a  territory  covering  fifty  miles  in  extent 
at  Elizabethtown,  Rahway,  Amboy,  Cheesequakes,  Piscataway,  Rocky 
Hill,  and  a  congregation  near  Freehold.  This  diligence  raised  a  zealous 
spirit  amongst  the  people,  but  unfortunately- his  services  were  terminated 
in  the  autumn  of  1707  by  his  being  lost  at  sea  on  his  way  to  England. 
The  Rev.  Edward  Vaughan  succeeded  Mr.  Brook  in  1709,  and  gave 
Amboy  as  much  attention  as  possible,  having  Elizabethtown  and  other 
missions  to  visit  frequently.  The  growth  of  the  Elizabethtown  con- 
gregation required  more  and  more  of  Mr.  Vaughan's  attention,  and 
Amboy  was  obliged  to  procure  a  separate  minister;  the  Rev.  Thomas 
Halliday  commenced  his  labors  there  in  the  summer  of  1711,  the  con- 
gregation of  Piscataway  being  also  under  his  charge.  Mr.  Halliday 
became  involved  with  the  political  factions  which  were  causing  unhappy 
dissensions  in  New  Jersey;  his  course  was  obnoxious  to  his  congrega- 
tion, and  he  was  finally  refused  access  to  the  church  by  his  parishioners. 
This  was  in  the  summer  of  1713 ;  the  following  year,  Mr.  Vaughan  having 
taken  up  his  residence  in  Amboy,  officiated  as  rector  of  the  church  one 
Sunday  in  every  four. 

A  charter  was  granted  to  the  congregation  by  Governor  Hunter, 
July  30,  1718 ;  upon  the  receipt  of  that  document  the  parish  was  regularly 
established,  a  new  church  was  built  and  dedicated  in  1722,  and  named 
St.  Peter's.  The  church  was  merely  an  oblong  building  of  the  most 
simple  architecture,  forty-eight  feet  long  and  thirty  feet  broad,  crown- 
ing a  knoll  overlooking  the  waters  of  the  bay.  The  completion  of  the 
church  rendering  the  congregation  more  anxious  for  regular  and  fre- 
quent services,  the  Society  for  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel  appointed 
Rev.  William  Skinner  to  be  their  missionary.  He  commenced  his  labors 
in  Amboy  in  the  autumn  of  1722,  and  April  7,  1724,  received  a  call  to 
become  the  regular  incumbent  of  the  rectorship  of  the  church.  When 
Mr.  Skinner  commenced  upon  his  duties  there  were  about  twenty  com- 
municants, two  years  later  seventy  families  belonging  to  the  congrega- 
tion. During  his  rectorship,  which  terminated  with  his  death  in  1758, 
there  were  fluctuating  changes  in  the  attendance  upon  divine  service, 
but  the  years  previous  to  his  death  shows  the  number  of  communicants 
increased  and  the  church  became  too  small  to  accommodate  the  con- 
gregation. The  successor  of  Rev.  William  Skinner  was  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Palmer,  who  resigned  in  1762  and  removed  to  New  Haven,  Connecticut. 

It  was  in  February,  1763,  that  the  Rev.  Robert  McKean  arrived  at 
Perth  Amboy  to  take  charge  of  the  congregation.  His  report  to  the 
Society  for  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel  states  that  there  were  from 


388  MIDDLESEX 

forty  to  fifty  families  that  professed  to  belonging  to  the  Church  of  Eng- 
land, and  there  were  twelve  to  fifteen  more  who  attended  upon  his  serv- 
ices in  preference  to  any  other;  these  included  nearly  two-thirds  of  the 
inhabitants,  the  remainder  being  chiefly  Presbyterians  and  a  few 
Quakers.  His  communicants  numbered  thirty-four.  Improvements 
were  made  in  the  church  in  1764,  about  twelve  feet  being  added  to  its 
length,  a  plain  spire  built  on  top  of  the  steeple ;  the  cost  of  these  additions 
was  defrayed  by  means  of  a  lottery.  Mr.  McKean  died  October  17,  1767 ; 
during  his  four  years  of  rectorship  he  also  practiced  medicine.  Imme- 
diately after  his  death,  measures  were  taken  to  secure  a  successor,  but  in 
the  meantime  the  Rev.  John  Preston,  chaplain  of  the  26th  British  Regi- 
ment, officiated,  and  by  a  vote  of  the  vestry  in  December,  1768,  he  became 
the  regular  incumbent.  Mr.  Preston  remained  at  Amboy  until  1774,  act- 
ing as  chaplain,  also  as  missionary  until  the  tide  of  war  caused  his 
removal. 

From  January  3,  1774,  to  November  11,  1782,  there  are  no  records 
of  the  vestry's  proceedings,  and  it  is  doubtful  if  any  meetings  were  held. 
The  Revolutionary  War  caused  the  congregation  to  scatter  abroad,  many 
to  seek  homes  in  foreign  lands,  while  others  were  obliged  to  attend  else- 
where the  calls  of  their  own  or  their  country's  interests.  The  sacred 
edifice  was  laid  open  to  the  injuries  of  the  weather;  the  works  inside 
were  torn  to  pieces ;  the  floor,  cleared  of  pews,  was  occupied  as  a  stable 
for  horses.  In  the  churchyard,  the  graves  and  monuments  were  exposed 
to  injury  by  the  destruction  of  the  fences;  against  the  headstones  fires 
were  lighted  by  soldiers  to  prepare  their  food,  and  the  tombstones  were 
used  to  serve  their  meals  on.  The  church  bravely  stood  these  demoli- 
tions and  weathered  the  storm;  at  the  close  of  the  Revolution,  services 
were  again  held,  the  Rev.  Abraham  Beach  having  charge  of  the  congrega- 
tion for  two  or  three  years,  when  he  removed  to  Nova  Scotia.  The 
church  was  still  in  a  dilapidated  condition;  a  loan  of  £150  was  obtained, 
the  windows  and  floors  were  repaired,  and  from  the  sale  of  a  grant  of 
one  hundred  acres,  besides  private  contributions  of  the  inhabitants,  a 
sufficient  fund  was  raised  to  warrant  the  completion  of  the  interior.  The 
pulpit  was  changed  from  between  the  two  north  windows  to  the  east 
end,  the  pews  rearranged,  leaving  a  single  aisle  to  run  the  length  of  the 
church. 

Mr.  Rowland's  labors  ceased  about  August,  1786;  in  that  month  Mr. 
Joseph  I.  Bend,  a  candidate  for  orders,  a  schoolmaster  in  the  city,  was 
engaged  as  lay  reader.  On  being  ordained,  Mr.  Bend  removed  south, 
and  was  succeeded  in  his  school  and  in  his  clerical  duties  by  George 
Hartwell  Spiesen.  This  gentleman  was  called  by  the  congregation  as 
soon  as  he  was  ordained,  July  9,  1788,  which  took  place  at  Perth  Amboy ; 
thus  the  first  ordination  in  New  Jersey  according  to  the  forms  of  the 
Protestant  Episcopal  church   took  place  within  the  walls  of  old   St. 


PERTH  AMBOY  389 

Peter's.  Mr.  Spiesen  was  an  Irishman,  profoundly  versed  in  the  lan- 
guages of  Greece  and  Rome,  not  unconversant  with  the  delicacies  of  the 
English,  and  a  powerful  preacher.  During  his  rectorship  a  bell  was 
presented  to  the  congregation  by  Captain  Philip  Lytheby,  a  Scotchman, 
which  was  inscribed  with  this  quaint  inscription :  "In  Perth  Amboy  my 
sound  enjoy,  1789."  The  previous  lottery  having  proved  advantageous 
for  the  church,  in  June,  1790,  another  was  attempted  to  raise  the  sum 
of  £350.  This  amount  was  secured,  and  an  additional  sum  was  obtained 
by  private  subscription.  Mr.  Spiesen's  precise  time  of  leaving  is  not 
known,  but  in  1791  the  vestry,  in  conjunction  with  that  of  Christ  Church, 
New  Brunswick,  invited  Rev.  Henry  Van  Dyke  to  become  rector  of  the 
two  churches.  Having  accepted  the  invitation,  he  arrived  at  Perth 
Amboy,  April  19,   1791,  and  officiated  alternately  until  June  or  July, 

1793- 

The  church  being  now  left  vacant,  the  vestry  thought  it  advisable 

until  they  could  offer  greater  inducements  to  a  permanently  settled  min- 
ister, to  obtain  one  of  the  neighboring  clergymen  to  supply  the  pulpit 
occasionally  or  for  a  stipulated  time.  The  congregation  on  November 
25,  1793,  engaged  the  Rev.  Richard  C.  Moore,  of  Staten  Island,  to  offi- 
ciate once  a  fortnight.  Mr.  Moore  for  several  years  performed  his  duties 
in  the  parish  and  was  afterwards  appointed  Bishop  of  Virginia.  The 
growth  and  welfare  of  the  congregation,  however,  required  the  services 
of  a  permanently  settled  pastor,  though  at  that  time  there  was  a  scarcity 
of  unengaged  clergymen;  finally  in  1804  they  called  the  Rev.  Jasper  D. 
Jones  to  the  rectorship,  who  continued  in  charge  until  the  spring  of 
1809,  when  he  resigned.  The  Rev.  James  Chapman  was  chosen  rector 
September  9,  1809,  and  continued  until  his  resignation  in  1844. 

After  the  rectorship  of  Mr.  Chapman  closed,  the  church  was  supplied 
by  various  clergymen  for  some  months,  but  in  the  following  year  Rev. 
Hamble  J.  Leacock  was  called,  and  served  as  rector  until  1848,  when 
he  resigned.  The  vacancy  was  not  filled  until  the  summer  of  1849, 
by  the  calling  of  the  Rev.  H.  E.  E.  Pratt.  The  new  church  erected  on 
the  site  of  the  old  one  was  first  used  for  public  service  June  19,  1853.  Mr. 
Pratt  removed  to  California  in  1854,  and  Rev.  Alexander  Jones  was 
invited  to  the  rectorship  January  i,  1855.  His  successor  was  Rev.  Alex- 
ander R.  Walker,  who  had  charge  from  1871  to  1877,  and  gave  way  for 
one  year  to  the  Rev.  James  O.  Drumm.  The  Rev.  Everard  P.  Miller 
commenced  his  rectorship  in  1879. 

St.  Peter's,  after  standing  in  simple  majesty  as  an  honored  repre- 
sentative of  the  past  two  centuries,  on  the  bluff  overlooking  Prince's  Bay. 
is  now  being  improved  and  beautified  to  an  extent  highly  gratifying  to 
the  parish.  The  walls  and  other  portions  of  the  building  were  so  much 
damaged  by  the  explosion  at  the  Morgan  munition  plant  in  October. 
1917,  that  extensive  repairs  were  needed,  and  it  was  decided  to  make  a 


390  MIDDLESEX 

thorough  renovation.  The  walls  were  resurfaced,  the  ceiling  was 
changed,  leaving  the  oaken  beams  exposed  to  view,  a  new  altar  and 
lighting  system  installed,  a  baptistry  and  chantry  built,  and  other  im- 
provements made.  A  number  of  memorial  windows  are  soon  expected 
from  Europe,  and  the  old  temple  in  its  new  dress  will  doubtless  be 
doubly  attractive  to  those  who  have  so  long  worshipped  within  its 
walls.  The  rectors  succeeding  Rev.  Everard  P.  Miller  have  been  Rev 
James  Leach  Lancaster,  1893-1914,  and  the  present  incumbent.  Rev.  W. 
Northey  Jones,  who  was  installed  in  1914. 

In  the  rear  a  few  feet  from  the  church  are  the  graves  of  Thomas 
Gordon  and  Helen,  his  wife.  He  and  John  Willocks  donated  the  ground 
where  the  church  stands,  together  with  the  cemetery  around  it.  The 
inscription  on  the  monument  is  in  Latin,  of  which  the  following  is  a 
literal  translation: 

In  Hope  of  a  Happy  Resurrection  here  is  Deposited  what  in  Thomas 
Gordon  was  found  Mortal,  who  being  descended  from  an  Ancient  Fam- 
ily, of  Pitlochie,  in  Scotland,  could  have  glorified,  had  that  been  proper, 
in  his  extraction;  yet  in  him  was  not  wanting  that  of  which  he  might 
justly  boast,  for  as  the  Secretary  of  the  Province  he  exerted  his  best 
abilities  in  behalf  of  the  Councils  of  the  State  acceptably  to  all.  Dear  to 
his  relations,  a  sincere  worshiper  of  the  eternal  Deity,  he  enjoyed  life, 
and  died  with  resignation  on  the  twenty-eighth  day  of  April,  in  the  year 
of  our  Lord,  1722,  in  the  seventieth  year  of  his  age. 

"His .  mourning  consort,  who  also  desires  to  be  interred  here,  has 
caused  this  monument,  such  as  it  is,  to  be  set.  He  lived  as  long  as  he 
desired,  as  along  as  the  Fates  appointed;  thus  neither  was  life  burden- 
some, nor  death  bitter." 

In  the  summer  of  1878,  former  members  of  the  St.  Peter's  Episcopal 
Church  erected  an  edifice  and  established  a  church  on  the  corner  of 
State  and  Washington  streets.  The  name  of  Church  of  the  Holy  Cross 
was  given  to  this  new  mission,  and  opening  services  were  held  on  St. 
Bartholomew's  Day,  August  24,  1878.  Shortly  after,  it  was  recognized 
by  the  bishop  of  the  diocese  as  an  independent  parish,  thus  the  founda- 
tion of  the  church  dates  from  December  4,  1878.  The  Rev.  J.  O.  Drumm, 
former  rector  of  St.  Peter's,  officiated  temporarily,  and  the  building 
was  removed  to  the  east  side  of  High  street,  near  Commerce  street. 
The  first  permanent  rector  was  Rev.  A.  B.  Conger,  who  served  from 
October,  1879,  to  Easter,  1880,  and  on  June  20th  of  that  year  Rev.  Wil- 
liam S.  Boardman  was  installed  as  his  successor.  At  the  present  time 
there  is  no  settled  rector. 

As  to  the  formation  of  a  Presbyterian  congregation  in  Amboy  in  the 
early  part  of  the  eighteenth  century,  for  the  lack  of  authentic  records 
we  are  unable  to  give  a  definite  history.  In  the  record  of  a  meeting  held 
by  the  East  Jersey  Proprietors,  July  22,  1731,  John  Matthie,  John

Leigh,  John  Moore,  John  Harriott,  John  Thompson,  Samuel  Moores, 
and  Alexander  Carnes  petitioned  the  honorable  council  to  lease  them 
for  a  term  of  one  thousand  years  a  lot  of  land  on  which  they  would  have 
the  liberty  to  erect  a  building.  The  lot  designated  was  situated  on  what 
is  now  State  street,  formerly  known  as  Back  street,  and  was  known  for 
many  years  as  the  Presbyterian  burial  ground.  Between  1731  and  1735, 
the  privilege  accorded  by  the  proprietors  was  secured  by  the  erection 
of  a  small  building  which  was  for  a  long  time  used  by  the  Presbyterians 
as  their  house  of  worship.  There  is  no  evidence,  however,  of  any  settled 
minister,  and  information  as  to  who  from  time  to  time  administered  to 
the  flock  is  very  limited.  The  edifice  was  demolished  during  the  Revolu- 
tion. After  the  war,  meetings  were  held  in  the  court  house  and  private 
residences. 

Captain  John  Angus,  who  had  been  a  resident  of  Perth  Amboy  for 
a  few  years,  in  1801  commenced  persevering  efforts  towards  building  a 
new  church,  and  in  the  following  year  the  foundation  for  a  new  edifice 
was  laid.  The  new  church  was  opened  for  divine  service  January  9, 
1803,  with  a  sermon  by  Dr.  Samuel  Stanhope  Smith,  president  of  the 
College  of  New  Jersey.  The  Rev.  Elias  Riggs,  a  licentiate  of  the  Pres- 
bytery of  New  York,  became  the  regular  pastor  March  7,  1802,  and  was 
ordained  in  the  new  meeting  house  August  2,  1803.  He  remained  about 
four  years,  and  for  a  short  time  after  his  retirement  a  Mr.  Keys  officiated 
as  minister,  but  was  not  settled  as  pastor,  and  continued  only  about  a 
year.  The  Rev.  Peter  Stryker  was  called  and  was  installed  November  28, 
1809.  His  stay  was  short,  as  he  resigned  in  August,  1810,  to  accept 
a  call  from  congregations  of  the  Reformed  Dutch  church.  For  four 
years  the  congregation  was  dependent  upon  occasional  supplies.  The 
Rev.  Joshua  Young  commenced  his  labors  for  the  congregation  Decem- 
ber 17,  1814.  His  ministerial  character,  however,  soon  became  sus- 
picious, and  he  was  discharged.  The  next  pastor  was  Rev.  Josiah  B. 
Andrews,  who  commenced  his  labors  June  6,  1816.  After  being  pastor 
seven  or  eight  years,  a  disturbance  arose  between  him  and  the  congre- 
gation which  resulted  in  his  removal.  The  congregation  was  without 
a  stated  minister  until  1828,  when  Mr.  Nicholas  A.  Wilson,  a  licentiate, 
became  their  supply;  he  was  shortly  afterwards  ordained,  remained  as 
pastor  two  or  three  years,  and  then  removed  to  Philadelphia.  The  next 
to  assume  charge  was  Rev.  Peter  H.  Shaw,  who  came  in  183 1.  He  con- 
tinued only  about  sixteen  or  eighteen  months,  when  he  was  -succeeded 
by  Rev.  David  R.  Gillmer,  who  left  after  a  term  of  eleven  months.  The 
Rev.  Benjamin  Cory  succeeded  Mr.  Gillmer,  and  was  ordained  as  pastor 
May  6,  1835.  During  his  ministry  both  the  temporal  and  spiritual 
interests  of  the  congregation  were  improved.  At  the  end  of  his  pastorate 
of  twenty-five  years,  there  were  one  hundred  and  forty-four  members, 
and  fifty-nine  pewholders  belonging  to  the  congregation.     The   Rev. 


392  MIDDLESEX 

Charles  C.  Wallace  was  installed  pastor  October  29,  i860,  and  remained 
a  little  over  three  years,  when  Rev.  James  A.  Little  became  a  stated 
supply  and  was  installed  as  pastor  April  27,  1865.  During  his  pastorate 
of  three  years,  the  church  was  repaired  at  the  expense  of  $10,000.  A 
call  was  extended  in  July,  1869,  to  Rev.  Aaron  Peck,  who  accepted  and 
was  installed  January  19,  1870.  During  his  ministry  the  church  was 
cleared  of  debt;  he  remained  until  1877,  and  was  succeeded  in  the  fall 
of  that  year  by  Rev.  N.  W.  Cary,  who  continued  with  other  supplies 
until  July  13,  1880,  when  Rev.  David  Stevenson  received  a  call  and  was 
installed  on  October  13th  of  that  year. 

Rev.  James  H.  Owens,  of  Bushnell,  Illinois,  the  successor  of  Rev. 
David  Stevenson,  was  installed  August  12,  1886,  and  a  manse  was 
built  on  High  street  in  the  following  year.  In  1891  a  new  chapel  was 
erected  in  the  rear  of  the  church,  and  in  1894  Mr.  Owens  resigned  and 
became  the  pastor  of  the  East  Side  Church,  of  Paterson.  Rev.  George 
B.  Van  Dyke,  of  Watertown,  New  York,  was  installed,  and  after  serv- 
ing for  four  years  resigned  to  accept  a  call  from  the  Presbyterian  church 
at  Hammonton,  New  Jersey.  The  pulpit  was  filled  for  one  year  by  Rev. 
Henry  Ketcham,  of  Westfield,  at  the  end  of  which  time  Rev.  Dr.  Harlan 
G.  Mendenhall  became  the  pastor.  The  increase  in  membership  and  the 
rapid  growth  of  the  city  demanded  increased  accommodations,  and 
the  corner-stone  of  the  present  church  was  laid  April  12,  1902.  The 
services  were  very  interesting,  many  visiting  clergymen  and  others 
being  present.  Mayor  Charles  K.  Seaman,  the  pastors  of  the  Methodist, 
Baptist,  and  other  churches,  delivered  addresses,  and  the  clergy  of 
Elizabeth,  Woodbridge  and  Metuchen  participated  in  the  exercises. 
The  church,  on  the  corner  of  High  and  Market  streets  and  facing  the 
City  Hall  park,  is  of  old  English  Gothic  style,  built  of  peach  blossom 
granite,  with  one  large  and  two  smaller  towers,  is  a  handsome  structure, 
and  beautifully  and  tastefully  furnished.  Revs.  James  H.  Northrup  and 
William  A.  Littell  succeeded  Dr.  Mendenhall,  and  the  present  pastor, 
Rev.  Frederick  D.  Niedermeyer,  was  installed  in  1920. 

The  first  date  on  record  of  Methodist  preaching  in  Amboy  is  fur- 
nished by  the  journal  of  Bishop  Francis  Asbury,  who  states  that  on 
Tl-.ursday,  February  27,  1772,  he  preached  in  a  large  upper  room  at 
Mr.  T.'s,  in  Amboy.  The  entry  also  shows  that  he  was  entertained  at 
the  Long  Ferry  House,  which  was  operated  in  connection  with  a  ferry 
connecting  the  stages  between  New  York  and  Philadelphia.  The  regu- 
lar services  of  the  Methodist  preacher  dates  from  about  1813,  when 
Amboy  was  included  in  the  Elizabethtown  circuit,  and  Revs.  Thomas 
Morrell,  Robert  Cloud,  John  McCloskey,  Joseph  Totten  and  David 
Bartine  were  among  the  first  circuit  preachers  and  were  instrumental  in 
the  formation  of  a  church  in  the  city.  A  regular  organization  was 
formed  in  1818,  but  it  was  not  until  1837  that  a  church  edifice  was 


PERTH  AMBOY  393 

built,  mainly  through  the  exertions  of  the  Rev.  Isaac  Cross,  who  became 
the  first  settled  minister.  He  remained  two  years,  according  to  the 
itinerant  rules  of  the  Methodist  church.  When  the  church  was  organ- 
ized there  were  but  twelve  members;  this  had  increased  in  1882  to 
a  membership  of  two  hundred  and  twenty.  The  present  church,  known 
as  the  "Simpson  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,"  on  the  corner  of  High 
and  Jefferson  streets,  was  erected  in  1866,  with  a  seating  capacity  of 
six  hundred.    The  Rev.  Wilbert  Westcott  was  pastor  in  1919. 

The  First  Danish  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  on  the  corner  of 
Jefferson  street  and  Madison  avenue,  was  organized  in  1868  by  a  number 
of  immigrants  from  Denmark  who  had  settled  in  the  city  and  attended 
services  in  the  Methodist  church.  Prominent  among  these  immigrants 
were  Mr.  Buck  and  his  sons,  who  resided  in  an  antiquated  stone  build- 
ing on  the  southwest  corner  of  Fayette  street  and  Maiden  Lane.  The 
Bucks  were  gifted  in  vocal  music,  and  their  home  became  a  Danish 
rendezvous,  the  exercises  soon  partaking  of  a  religious  character,  result- 
ing in  the  conversion  of  a  number  of  persons,  thus  forming  the  nucleus 
of  a  society  that  worshipped  for  two  or  three  years  in  a  building  on  the 
east  side  of  State  street  between  Fayette  and  Jefferson  streets.  A  plain 
neat  structure  was  built  and  dedicated  in  1876,  seating  two  hundred 
persons,  and  the  Rev.  F.  W.  Erickson  became  the  regular  pastor.  The 
congregation  at  the  present  time  is  in  charge  of  Rev.  Ole  Neilsen. 

The  first  organization  of  a  church  of  the  Baptist  denomination  in 
Perth  Amboy  took  place  August  26,  1818.  The  Rev.  Thomas  Winters 
received  a  unanimous  call  to  become  pastor  of  a  small  congregation, 
which  he  accepted,  remaining  in  charge  until  1823,  when  he  was  suc- 
ceeded by  the  Rev  Jabez  C.  Goble.  Services  were  held  in  the  old  court 
house,  and  sometimes  at  the  residence  of  some  of  the  members,  but  in 
1824  the  erection  of  a  church  was  commenced.  It  was  not  completed  for 
several  years,  and  in  1855  extensive  repairs  were  necessitated  by  changes 
in  the  grade  of  the  street.  The  pulpit  since  the  retirement  of  Rev.  Jabez 
C.  Goble  was  filled  for  the  next  half  a  century  by  no  less  than  a  score 
of  ministers  who  remained  in  charge  of  the  congregation  for  two  or 
three  years  each. 

The  First  Baptist  Church  has  been  worshipping  for  a  number  of 
years  past  in  their  church  on  Madison  avenue,  near  Market  street,  the 
previous  church  on  Fayette  street  having  been  sold.  The  congregation 
has  recently  purchased  the  residence  and  property  of  the  late  Dr.  Charles 
McKnight  Smith,  corner  of  High  and  Market  streets,  and  propose  in  the 
near  future  to  erect  a  church  thereon.  The  present  pastor  is  Rev.  William 
H.  Bawden.  Some  of  the  natives  of  Hungary,  residents  of  the  city,  are 
members  of  the  congregation  of  the  Hungarian  Baptist  Church  on  the 
corner  of  Keene  and  Francis  streets.  The  present  pastor  is  the  Rev. 
Andrew  Toth.    Other  citizens  of  this  nativity  are  members  of  the  con- 


394  MIDDLESEX 

gregation  of  the  Magyar  Reformed  Church  on  Kirkland  street,  the  Rev. 
Louis  Nanassy  being  the  present  pastor. 

The  first  services  held  in  Perth  Amboy  under  the  rites  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  religion  were  prior  to  the  year  1842,  in  the  house  of  James 
Tuite,  on  every  alternate  Sunday.  It  was  in  1846,  through  the  endeav- 
ors of  the  Rev.  Thomas  Quin  that  a  neat  brick  church  was  erected  on 
Centre  street  at  a  cost  of  about  $3,000.  Since  the  founding  of  this  church, 
St.  Mary's,  the  following  pastors  have  been  in  charge:  The  Rev.  Ber- 
nard McArdle :  Father  Madrana,  who  was  the  parish  priest  at  the  Quar- 
antine Station  on  Staten  Island ;  Revs.  John  Rodgers,  Stephen  Sheridan, 
Patrick  McCarthy,  John  Cornell.  The  latter  was  succeeded  by  Rev. 
Peter  L.  Connolly,  who  retired  September  3,  1898,  and  the  Rev.  Bernard 
T.  O'Connell,  of  Bound  Brook,  New  Jersey,  was  assigned  to  St.  Mary's. 
Father  O'Connell,  on  taking  charge  of  the  parish,  commenced  the  erec- 
tion of  the  present  rectory  adjoining  the  church ;  he  removed  the  convent 
to  the  opposite  corner  from  the  church.  In  1903,  the  reverend  father 
built  one  of  the  most  attractive  and  artistic  religious  edifices  in  the 
State,  on  the  corner  of  Centre  and  Mechanic  streets.  The  internal 
arrangements  are  fully  equal  to  the  exterior,  and  will  always  be  a 
lasting  monument  to  the  zeal  and  enterprise  of  the  faithful  and  beloved 
pastor  under  whose  direction  it  was  constructed.  Father  O'Connell's 
health  failed  gradually,  and  in  1915  he  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Dr.  Wil- 
liam P.  Cantwell,  the  present  incumbent. 

Among  the  Catholic  population  of  Perth  Amboy  prominently  identi- 
fied with  its  business  interests  are  Hungarians,  Slavs,  Italians  and 
Polish,  whp  have  established  places  of  worship  that  have  grown  from 
a  humble  commencement  to  large,  influential  and  prosperous  parishes. 
Among  these  are  the  Church  of  Our  Lady  of  Hungary,  on  Cortlandt 
street,  under  the  pastoral  charge  of-  Rev.  Francis  Gross ;  the  Church 
of  Our  Lady  of  the  Most  Holy  Rosary,  on  Barclay  street,  the  priest  in 
charge  being  the  Rev.  Colombino  Galassi;  the  Holy  Trinity  Roman 
Catholic  Slovak  Church,  on  the  corner  of  Penn  and  Neville  streets,  in 
charge  of  the  Rev.  Joseph  Szuchy;  the  St.  Stephen's  Polish  Catholic 
Church,  corner  of  State  and  Buckingham  avenue,  the  spiritual  welfare 
of  the  congregation  being  in  charge  of  the  Rev.  Joseph  Urban.  Under 
the  generic  name  Roman  Catholics  are  comprised  all  those  Christians 
who  acknowledge  the  supremacy  of  the  Roman  Pontiff,  even  though 
they  be  not  of  the  Roman  or  Latin  rite,  therefore  churches  of  other  rites 
are  included  under  this  designation  and  are  permitted  to  retain  their  own 
national  liturgy  and  language,  and  for  the  most  part  their  established 
discipline  and  usages.  There  are  in  Perth  Amboy  the  following  churches 
where  services  are  conducted  under  these  provisions :  The  Hungarian 
Slavish  Greek  Catholic  Church  of  St.  John  the  Baptist,  under  Rev. 
Peter  Kustan,  on  the  corner  of  Broad  and  Division  streets ;  the  Ruthen-

ian  Greek  Catholic  Assumption  Church,  on  Easton  avenue,  of  which  the 
present  priest  is  Rev.  Joseph  Czaplinski ;  St.  Michael's  Catholic  Magyar 
Church  of  the  Greek  Rite,  on  the  corner  of  Hall  and  Amboy  avenues, 
is  under  the  supervision  of  Rev.  Victor  Kovaliczky;  the  St.  Spiridoin 
Russian  Orthodox  Greek  Catholic  Church  is  located  on  Elizabeth  street, 
the  priest  in  charge  being  the  Rev.  Dimitrius  Jarema. 

Grace  Evangelical  Lutheran  (English  speaking)  Church  was  organ- 
ized and  the  church  and  manse  erected  on  Jefferson  street  in  1903.  Rev. 
Emil  Keuling  was  pastor  until  1905,  when  Rev.  Robert  Schlotter  suc- 
ceeded him.  During  the  latter  period  the  church  building  was  raised  and 
the  basement  fitted  up  as  a  Sabbath  school  room.  The  membership  of  the 
church  is  400,  and  that  of  the  Sabbath  school  350. 

The  congregation  of  the  St.  Paul's  Deutsche  Evangelische  Church 
on  First  street  is  composed  of  residents  of  the  city  of  German  nativity  and 
their  descendants.  The  services  are  held  in  their  mother  language 
under  the  pastorage  of  the  Rev.  Jacob  Ganss. 

Some  of  the  natives  of  Denmark  in  the  city  with  their  families, 
constitute  a  congregation  known  as  St.  Stefan's  Danish  Evangelical 
Lutheran  Church.  Their  place  of  worship  is  located  on  Broad  street, 
and  services  are  held  regularly,  the  present  pastor  being  Rev.  Hans 
Hansen.  Other  Danish  families  attend  the  services  of  the  Our  Saviour's 
Danish  Lutheran  Church  on  State  street,  conducted  by  Rev.  Villads  B. 
Skov. 

The  first  Hebrew  synagogue  was  erected  on  Hobart  street  and  it  was 
given  the  name  Beth  Mordecai  in  honor  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Henry  Wolff,  of 
South  Amboy,  and  their  son.  Max.  The  second  synagogue  was  erected 
on  Madison  avenue,  near  Jefferson  street,  and  known  as  Sherai  Tefiloh 
Temple.  It  is  a  large  and  imposing  structure,  and  has  a  membership  of 
200.  The  Young  Men's  and  Young  Women's  Hebrew  Associations  will 
soon  erect  a  handsome  building  adjoining  the  synagogue.  Rabbi  S.  Rab- 
binowitz  has  been  located  here  for  five  years.  There  is  also  a  temple  on 
Hall  avenue. 

The  Salvation  Army  became  an  established  institution  in  the  city 
in  1888.  The  headquarters  were  located  in  a  number  of  places  until 
about  four  years  ago,  when  the  present  building,  on  Madison  avenue, 
near  Jefferson  street,  was  erected.  A  hotel  for  men  is  operated  in  con- 
nection with  the  Army  work.  Captain  G.  Kliphouse  is  the  efficient  officer 
in  charge. 

There  are  in  the  city  besides  the  churches  already  mentioned,  the 
Danish  Seventh  Day  Adventists,  who  have  a  house  of  worship  on  Neville 
street,  and  the  First  Swedish  Congregation,  who  hold  services  in  a 
church  located  on  Gordon  street.

CHAPTER  XXVIII 
CITY  OF  SOUTH  AMBOY. 

South  Amboy,  situated  on  the  extreme  eastern  border  of  Middlesex 
county,  is  separated  from  Perth  Amboy  and  Staten  Island  by  Raritan 
Bay,  which  forms  its  northern  and  northeastern  boundary.  On  the 
south  it  is  bounded  by  Madison,  and  west  by  Sayreville  township. 
Wljen  formed,  it  was  one  of  the  oldest  and  largest  of  the  townships; 
but,  by  the  reduction  of  its  area,  in  the  formation  of  other  townships, 
it  is  now  the  smallest,  territorially,  of  the  townships;  yet  the  portion 
which  remains  is  commercially  very  important,  and  in  the  past  extended 
its  improving  influence  far  inland  in  every  direction.  Beds  of  valuable 
clay  and  sand  extend  in  all  directions  inland,  and  have  always  been 
important  factors  in  its  commerce  and  manufactures.  The  Camden 
&amp;  Amboy  division  of  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  and  the  New  York  &amp; 
Long  Branch  division  of  the  New  Jersey  Central  railroad,  afford  excel- 
lent facilities  for  travel  and  freight,  the  former  causing  the  growth  of 
the  town  and  supplying  employment  on  its  railroad  tracks  and  coal 
docks,  and  in  its  offices,  shops  and  freighting  industry,  to  a  large  pro- 
portion of  the  population.  The  different  trolley  lines  connect  it  with 
many  points  in  Middlesex  and  Monmouth  counties. 

In  1683  the  Proprietors  of  East  Jersey  made  strenuous  exertions 
to  open  a  road  from  Perth  Amboy  to  Burlington,  to  divert  the  travel 
that  was  then  taking  the  route  from  Elizabethtown  Point  to  the  Dela- 
ware, via  New  Brunswick,  and  in  1684  Deputy-Governor  Laurie  suc- 
ceeded in  opening  a  road,  which  is  still  used,  connecting  it  by  a  ferry- 
boat to  Staten  Island.  Notwithstanding  all  these  efforts,  the  old  Dutch 
road,  via  New  Brunswick,  continued  to  be  the  more  popular. 

One  of  the  first  settlers  was  Lazarus  Wilmurt,  who  located  very 
early  on  the  property  afterward  owned  by  the  late  Richard  S.  Conover. 
His  son  Daniel  became  very  prominent  as  a  hotel  keeper  and  the  owner 
of  lines  of  boats  and  stages.  Timothy  Rose  located  on  the  Kearney 
tract,  west  of  the  village,  and  left  a  large  family.  John  Disbrow,  the 
earliest  known  representative  of  the  family  in  this  locality,  owned  a 
large  tract  of  land  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  settlement,  and  extending 
to  the  Bay ;  he  sold  the  property  to  Samuel  Gordon  in  1808,  and  removed 
to  Roundabout,  now  Sayreville.  Early  in  1800,  several  families  resided 
along  the  bay-shore,  among  them  the  Morgans,  Rolfes,  Brookfields, 
Bloodgoods,  Johnsons,  Kearneys,  Hansels,  and  Hanks.  The  Rattoone 
House,  an  old  hostelry,  the  date  of  its  erection  being  unknown,  stood 
at  the  end  of  the  old  Bordentown  road  during  the  Revolution.  It  was 
a  large,  low  and  rambling  structure,  and  kept  by  John  Rattoone,  of 


398  MIDDLESEX 

Perth  Amboy,  a  justice  of  the  peace  in  1791 ;  it  was  destroyed  by  fire 
in  1849. 

In  1833  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  railroad  ran  its  first  train  to  Borden- 
town,  drawn  by  a  locomotive  which  had  been  made  in  England  for  this 
road.  It  was  on  exhibition  at  the  Centennial  Exposition  in  Philadelphia 
in  1876,  and  always  known  as  the  "Johnny  Bull."  Samuel  Gordon 
opened  the  first  store  in  1808.  John  Perrine,  known  as  Judge,  father  of 
Orlando  and  Harry  C,  started  a  store  in  1831  on  the  east  side  of  Main 
street,  and  had  many  successors.  Other  merchants  have  been  John  E. 
Montgomery,  Benjamin  F.  Howell,  James  Gordon,  Orlando  and  Ward 
C.  Perrine,  John  Hillman,  William  Thorn,  Jacob  Goodman,  Isaiah 
E)isbrow  and  others.  About  this  time  the  establishment  of  several 
building  and  loan  associations  were  great  factors  in  the  growth  of  the 
town.  In  187s,  the  New  York  &amp;  Long  Branch  division  of  the  New 
jersey  Central  railroad  was  put  in  operation  and  afforded  a  much  needed 
means  of  transportation  to  the  metropolis. 

The  first  resident  lawyer  was  Charles  Morgan,  son  of  the  General, 
and  the  first  physician  was  Dr.  L.  D.  Morse,  who  came  in  1832.  The 
postoffice  was  established  in  1844,  with  Charles  Perrine  as  postmaster. 
Among  his  successors  have  been  Abraham  S.  Everett,  Albert  Roll, 
Henry  C.  and  Mrs.  Cadmus,  Bernard  Roddy  and  Frank  Degraw.  James 
Rea  is  the  present  postmaster.  Samuel  Gordon  was  the  pioneer  clay 
miner,  commencing  in  1807  and  continuing  until  his  death  in  1834. 
Maxfield,  Parisen,  Everett,  Perrine,  Disbrow  and  the  Furmans,  also 
mined  clay  and  fire-sand.  A  factory  known  as  the  Congress  Hill  Pottery 
was  built  at  an  early  date  near  the  shore,  at  the  foot  of  Bordentown 
turnpike,  by  William  Hancock,  from  England,  who  made  a  superior 
quality  of  chinaware.  In  1849,  Abraham  Cadmus  purchased  the  plant 
and  manufactured  Rockingham  and  yellow-ware.  The  Bergen  Iron 
Works,  originally  built  in  1832  in  Monmouth  county  by  Joseph  W. 
Brick,  was  removed  in  1880  by  his  son,  R.  A.  Brick,  to  South  Amboy, 
who  made  pipes  for  water  and  gas.  A  large  foundry,  machine  shop  and 
other  buildings  were  erected,  and  an  extensive  business  was  done  for 
years. 

The  Swan  Hill  Pottery,  on  Raritan  Bay  shore,  was  built  by  Sparks 
&amp;  Moore  in  1849  ^°^  the  manufacture  of  Rockingham  and  yellow-ware. 
After  a  great  number  of  changes  of  proprietors  it  became  the  property 
of  the  late  Henry  C.  Perrine,  who  conducted  it  for  a  number  of  years. 
It  is  now  devoted  to  the  manufacture  of  terra-cotta.  The  Providence 
Pottery,  near  the  above,  was  erected  by  James  Wooton  in  1876,  and 
Rockingham,  yellow  and  white  majolica  ware,  and  white  and  colored 
vases  and  plaques,  were  manufactured.  The  business  was  removed  to 
Old  Bridge  a  number  of  years  ago.  In  1872,  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy 
railroad  was  leased  by  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  which  soon  began  to 


CITY  OF  SOUTH  AMBOY  399 

build  car-noats  to  transport  loaded  freight  cars  across  the  Hudson 
river  from  Jersey  City  to  New  York.  This  caused  a  great  loss  of  busi- 
ness to  South  Amboy,  and  labor  sought  employment  to  a  greater  extent 
than  before  on  the  co'al  docks.  The  Pennsylvania  railroad  continued  to 
increase  the  shipment  of  coal  and  to  build  wharves  for  that  purpose,  until 
now  the  city  is  one  of  the  most  important  coal  ports  in  the  country. 

South  Amboy  was  erected  as  a  township  soon  after  the  organization 
of  Middlesex  county  in  1685.  Originally  it  was  eighteen  miles  long  and 
six  miles  wide,  and  had  an  area  of  64,000  acres.  In  1838,  Monroe  was 
taken  from  its  territory ;  in  1869,  Madison ;  and  in  1876,  Sayreville.  An 
act  passed  by  the  Council  and  Assembly,  February  23,  1838,  erecting 
Monroe  township  out  of  that  portion  of  South  Amboy  lying  west  of  the 
Matchaponix  and  South  rivers,  also  provided  that  the  inhabitants  of  that 
part  of  South  Amboy  township  that  lies  east  of  the  said  Matchaponix 
and  South  rivers  "be  constituted  a  body  politic  and  corporate,  by  the 
name  of  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Township  of  South  Amboy,  in  the  County 
of  Middlesex,"  and  appointing  the  first  town  meeting  to  be  held  on  the 
second  Monday  of  April,  1838,  at  the  public-house  of  Clarkson  Brown. 
None  of  the  records  of  South  Amboy  prior  to  1838  can  be  found,  and  in 
many  of  the  years  the  minutes  are  totally  missing.  Among  former 
chosen  freeholders  were  Noah  Furman,  Ward  C.  Perrine,  John  Scully, 
Benjamin  F.  Howell,  Cornelius  McGonigle,  Leonard  and  Andrew  H. 
Furman  and  Michael  Welsh. 

St.  Mary's  (R.  C.)  Church  is  the  oldest  house  of  worship  in  the 
city.  Previous  to  1849,  Rev.  John  Rogers,  of  New  Brunswick,  con- 
ducted services  in  a  small  building.  In  that  year  Rev.  Michael  A. 
Madden  was  made  resident  pastor  and  a  church  was  built.  Rev.  John 
A.  Kelley  came  in  1854,  and  for  over  twenty-five  years  was  the  zealous 
and  beloved  pastor  of  his  people.  The  present  church,  a  large  and  hand- 
some edifice,  was  dedicated  September  17,  1876;  the  old  church  is  now 
used  as  a  parochial  school  and  lecture  hall.  Rev.  Dr.  Edward  C.  Griffin 
is  the  pastor. 

Methodist  services  were  first  held  in  private  houses  in  1832  by  Rev. 
L.  W.  Johnson,  who  remained  in  the  town  for  five  years,  and  was 
assisted  during  the  latter  part  of  that  term  by  Rev.  John  Stockton,  who 
remained  after  Mr  Johnson's  departure,  and  who,  it  is  supposed,  effected 
the  organization  of  the  church.  The  church  on  Broadway,  near  the 
centre  of  the  city,  was  built  in  1854  and  enlarged  in  1880.  Rev.  George 
W.  Abel  is  the  pastor. 

Christ  (P.  E.)  Church,  formeriy  St.  Stephen's  Church,  had  its  begin- 
ning in  religious  services  conducted  by  Rev.  Joseph  F.  Phillips,  of  St. 
Peter's  Church,  Spotswood,  in  a  small  building,  in  1850.  In  1852,  Mrs. 
Esther  B.  Stevens  erected  the  present  large  stone  church  on  Main  street, 
at  the  head  of  Broadway,  and  presented  it  to  the  parish.     In  1862,  by 


400  MIDDLESEX 

act  of  the  Legislature,  the  name  of  the  church  was  changed  to  that  of 
Christ  Church.  Rev.  H.  C.  Mitchell  is  the  rector.  The  Doane  Memorial 
Chapel  was  erected  in  1866  by  Mrs.  Richard  S.  Conover,  in  memory  of 
George  Washington  Doane,  formerly  bishop  of  the  Diocese  of  New 
Jersey.  It  is  on  the  road  from  South  Amboy  to  Matawan,  and  about 
a  mile  from  the  city. 

The  First  Presbyterian  Church  was  organized  in  1864  and  the  church 
erected  in  1868  on  Broadway."  Rev.  Herbert  J.  AUsup  is  the  pastor. 
The  Methodist  Protestant  Church  was  organized  January  17,  1866,  and 
two  years  later  a  church  was  erected.  The  pastor  is  Rev.  Thomas  H. 
Slater.  On  February  11,  1873,  the  First  Baptist  Church  was  organized 
and  a  church  built  in  1878.    Rev.  George  W.  McCombe  is  the  pastor. 

The  first  school  teachers  of  whom  there  is  any  record  were  John  F. 
Hunter,  Charles  H.  Knickerbocker  and  Oliver  Cox.  About  1850  Mrs. 
John  C.  Stevens  erected  a  school  house  at  the  intersection  of  Broadway 
and  Main  street,  and  presented  it  to  the  town.  It  was  in  use  until  two 
districts  were  established  and  new  buildings  erected.  The  city  now  has 
a  large  high  school,  and  two  other  schools,  employing  thirty-three 
teachers,  and  attended  by  800  pupils.  Prof.  Oscar  M.  Barr  is  the  city 
superintendent. 

The  First  National  Bank  was  organized  in  1888.  Officers :  Harry  C. 
Perrine,  president;  Daniel  C.  Chase,  vice-president;  R.  C.  Stephenson, 
cashier ;  T.  Francis  Perrine,  assistant  cashier  and  trust  officer.  Directors 
— The  above  officers,  and  Henry  Wolff,  J.  Baird  Perrine,  George  V. 
Bogart  and  Charles  Safran. 

The  borough  of  South  Amboy  was  established  in  1888,  with  Cornelius 
McGonigle  as  the  first  mayor.  The  charter  of  the  city  of  Perth  Amboy 
was  granted  June  12,  1908,  and  Dr.  Ambrose  Treganowan,  a  well-known 
physician,  was  chosen  as  the  first  mayor.  The  present  officials  are  as 
follows:  Mayor,  Francis  H.  Gordon;  aldermen — Michael  J.  Stanton, 
president ;  Daniel  J.  Delaney,  alderman-at-large ;  George  A.  Kress,  James 
W.  Hackett  and  Jacob  A.  Schuey;  clerk,  Peter  J.  Coakley;  collector, 
A.  V.  Vandusen ;  recorder,  Francis  H.  Gordon  (acting)  ;  solicitor,  Francis 
P.  Coan ;  physician,  Dr.  Eugene  M.  Meachem ;  Board  of  Education — 
Richard  M.  Mack,  president;  Daniel  J.  Delaney,  Richard  U.  Rue,  Wil- 
liam Woodward  and  Francis  P.  Coan;  clerk,  James  Halton;  Board  of 
Health — B.  J.  Monaghan,  Thomas  Lovely,  Stanley  Witowski,  Dr.  S. 
Kenny ;  and  Thomas  Tomazewski,  clerk ;  inspector,  Nicholas  Howley. 

The  city  has  numerous  lodges,  societies  and  beneficial  organizations : 
General  Morgan  Lodge,  Odd  Fellows;  St.  Stephen's  Lodge,  No.  63, 
Free  and  Accepted  Masons ;  Good  Samaritan  Lodge,  Knights  of  Pythias ; 
St.  Mary's  Temperance  and  Benevolent  Society ;  St.  Patrick's  Benevolent 
Society;  Ancient  Order  of  Hibernians,  and  Seneca  Tribe,  Independent 
Order  of  Red  Men.  Harold  E.  Picker.sgill. 


CHAPTER  XXIX. 
WOODBRIDGE  AND   PISCATAWAY   TOWNSHIPS. 

Woodbridge  Township  was  so  called  in  honor  of  Rev.  John  Wood- 
bridge,  who,  with  a  number  of  associates  and  their  families,  came  from 
Newbury,  Massachusetts,  in  the  latter  part  of  the  summer  of  1665,  and 
settled  in  Woodbridge,  at  the  solicitation  of  Captain  Philip  Carteret, 
Governor  of  the  Province  of  New  Jersey  and  cousin  of  Sir  George  Car- 
teret, who  with.  Lord  John  Berkeley  were  joint  Lords  Proprietors  of 
the  Province. 

Mr.  Woodbridge  was  born  in  Wiltshire,  England,  in  1613.  In  the 
old  manuscript,  "Records  of  Deeds  and  Surveys  in  Woodbridge,"  in 
the  Historical  Society's  Library,  his  name  is  attached  to  the  acknowl 
edgement  of  a  deed  given  by  Richard  Dole  to  John  Rolf,  dated  April 
27,  1685.  From  the  manner  in  which  his  name  is  signed  it  is  probable 
that  he  was  an  assistant  justice,  such  as  were  annually  elected  to  the 
township  court  in  the  early  days  of  Woodbridge.  These  original  settlers, 
about  thirty  families  in  all,  were  mainly  from  England  and  Scotland. 
The  following,  copied  from  the  East  Jersey  Records,  volume  i,  page  2, 
in  the  Secretary  of  State's  office  at  Trenton,  will  give  an  idea  of  the 
original  ownership  of  the  land  upon  which  the  township  was  founded : 

A  contract  made  by  Capt.  Philip  Carteret,  Governor  of  the  Province 
of  New  Jersey,  John  Ogden  and  Luke  Watson,  of  Elizabethtown,  of  the 
first  part ;  and  Daniel  Pearce,  of  Newbury,  Massachusetts,  and  his  asso- 
ciates, of  the  second  part,  dated  Dec.  11,  1666.  Daniel  Pearce  paid  to 
party  of  the  first  part  the  sum  of  four  score  pounds  sterling,  being  in 
full  for  said  tract  of  land  known  by  the  name  of  Arthur  Cull,  or  Amboyle, 
or  any  other  name  it  may  be  called  by.  This  land  was  purchased  from 
the  natives,  or  Indians,  by  John  Bayly,  Daniel  Denton  and  the  said 
Luke  Watson,  as  the  said  Bill  of  Sale  from  the  natives,  bearing  date 
Oct.  28,  1664,  will  more  fully  at  large  appear;  which  John  Bayly  and 
Daniel  Denton  have  made  over  to  the  said  Philip  Carteret,  and  John 
Ogden,  as  will  appear  by  the  bill  of  sale. 

Daniel  Pearce  made  choice  of  the  following  associates:  Joshua 
Pearce,  John  Pike,  John  Bishop,  Henry  Jaques  and  Hugh  March,  of 
Newbury,  Mass.;  Stephen  Kent,  of  Haverhill;  Robert  Dennis,  of  Yar- 
mouth ;  and  John  Smith,  of  Barnstable,  all  in  New  England.  These  writ- 
ings were  signed,  sealed  and  delivered  by  Daniel  Pearce  in  Elizabeth- 
town,  and  ordered  to  be  recorded  by  Philip  Carteret,  Governor  of  the 
Province  of  New  Jersey,  Dec.  3,  1767. 

Daniel  Pearce  and  his  associates  immediately  took  possession,  and 
through  the  efforts  of  Gov.  Carteret  a  number  of  other  families  during 
the  following  year  came  from  New  England  to  the  new  settlement.    On 

Mid— 26 


402  MIDDLESEX 

December  3,  1667,  it  was  ordered  that  the  proposed  township  be  sur- 
veyed, plots  assigned  to  each  settler,  and  roads  marked  out.  On  June 
I,  1669,  Woodbridge  township  was  created,  and  on  the  i6th  the  charter 
was  granted,  giving  the  general  boundaries  thus :  "On  the  east  side  by 
the  Arthur  Cull  river,  otherwise  called  the  Sound  that  parts  Staten 
Island  from  the  mainland;  on  the  north  side  by  the  bounds  belonging 
to  Elizabethtpwn ;  on  the  west  side  by  the  bounds  belonging  to  New 
Piscataway;  and  on  the  south  side  by  the  aforesaid  Raritan  river." 
The  township  was  to  contain  six  miles  square,  "which  amounts  to  23,040 
acres,  English  measure."  The  charter  provided  that  sixty  families,  at 
least,  should  be  comprised  within  the  township  limits,  among  whom  the 
land  should  be  equally  divided  by  lot,  or  in  such  other  manner  as  they 
themselves  might  decide.  An  official  record  of  each  man's  allotment 
was  to  be  made,  which  was  to  be  filed  in  the  secretary's  office  at  Eliza- 
bethtown,  the  capital  of  the  Province. 

Although  the  charter  went  into  effect  immediately  after  it  was 
granted,  it  was  not  confirmed  by  the  Lords  Proprietors,  Carteret  and 
Berkeley,  until  December  7,  1672.  The  following  is  the  list  of  free- 
holders, supposed  to  be  actual  settlers,  to  whom  patents  were  granted 
in  1670,  for  different  amounts  of  land,  varying  from  15  to  512  acres: 

Daniel  Pearce,  Joshua  Pearce,  John  Pike,  John  Pike,  Jr.,  Robert  Den- 
nis, John  Bishop,  Henry  Jaques,  Stephen  Kent,  Hugh  March,  and  John 
Smith,  millwright  (the  original  associates  of  Daniel  Pearce,  who  were 
each  granted  240  acres  of  upland  and  40  acres  of  (salt)  meadow,  in  addi- 
tion to  the  regular  allotment) ;  John  Adams,  Ephraim  Andrews,  Thomas 
Auger,  or  Alger;  Obadiah  Ayres,  Samuel  Baker,  or  Bacon;  Joseph 
Bradley,  John  Bishop,  Jr.,  Matthew  Bunn,  mariner ;  Thomas  Bloomfield, 
Thos.  Bloomfield,  Jr.,  John  Bloomfield,  John  Conger,  John  Cromwell, 
William  Compton,  John  and  Samuel  Dennis,  John  Dilly,  Hugh  Dun, 
Jonathan  Dunham,  John  French,  mason;  Rehoboth  Gannit,  Daniel 
Grasie,  Samuel  Haynes,  Elisha  Ilsley,  or  Inslee;  Henry  Jaques,  Jr.,  Ste- 
phen Kent,  Jr.,  Henry  Lessenby,  George  Little,  David  Makany,  Samuel 
and  Matthew  Moore,  Benjamin  Parker,  joiner;  Elisha  Parker,  Daniel 
Robins,  Robert  Rogers,  Samuel  Smith,  John  Smith,  "Scotchman ;"  Isaac 
and  Abraham  Tappen,  John  Taylor,  blacksmith;  Israel  Thorne,  Robert 
Vauquellin,  or  "La  Prairie;"  John  Watkins,  Nathan  Webster,  John 
Whitaker  and  Richard  Worth.  The  following  names  are  also  found  in 
the  Town  Book,  but  without  date :  Thomas  Adams,  John  Allen,  minister ; 
John  Averill,  William  Bingley,  Jonathan  Bishop,  James  Clawson,  or 
Clarkson ;  Jonathan  Dennis,  Hopewell  Hull,  John  Ilsley,  John  Martin, 
Thomas  Pike  and  John  Trewman. 

In  July,  1673,  a  fleet  of  Dutch  vessels  captured  New  York  and  New 
Jersey;  but  by  a  treaty  of  peace  between  England  and  Holland  in  the 
following  year  the  provinces  were  restored  to  England,  and  Philip 
Carteret  was  re-appointed  Governor. 

In  1677,  Governor  Carteret  bought  from  the  Indians  all  the  lands 
they  owned  between  Woodbridge  and  Piscataway  townships.     It  is  to 


WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  403 

the  credit  of  New  Jersey. that  not  a  rod  of  its  territory  was  wrested  from 
the  Indian  owners  by  fraud  or  violence,  a  fact  of  which  no  other  State, 
not  even  that  of  William  Penn,  can  boast.  The  Indians  in  and  around 
Woodbridge  were  chiefly  of  the  Raritan  tribe,  and  Metuchen,  of  which 
we  first  find  a  record  in  1701,  is  supposed  to  have  derived  its  name  from 
"Metucheon"  (signifying  "chief  of  the  Rolling  Land"),  a  Raritan 
sachem,  who  is  said  to  have  been  buried  on  a  farm  near  that  borough. 

The  first  Legislature  of  the  Province  met  at  Elizabethtown  (so 
named  in  honor  of  Elizabeth,  wife  of  Sir  George  Carteret),  on  May  26, 
1668,  and  was  composed  of  two  delegates  from  each  town,  Woodbridge 
being  represented  by  Samuel  Moore  and  Robert  Dennis.  The  second 
session  was  held  on  November  3rd  of  the  same  year,  and  attended  by 
delegates  from  Newark,  Elizabeth,  Woodbridge,  Bergen,  Shrewsbury 
and  Middletown.  The  latter  session  was  not  at  all  harmonious,  and  the 
next  meeting  did  not  occur  until  eight  years  later.  At  the  first  town 
meeting,  January  i,  1669,  Samuel  was  elected  town  clerk,  and  filled 
that  office  for  nearly  twenty  years. 

The  General  Assembly  of  the  Province  met  in  Woodbridge  October 
5,  1676,  lasting  four  days,  when  it  was  decided  that  the  Governor's 
salary  should  be  paid  in  "peas,  wheat,  or  tobacco."  A  general  Thanks- 
giving Day  was  ordered,  to  occur  on  the  second  Wednesday  of  November 
in  each  year.  Each  delegate  was  allowed  three  shillings  per  day.  Among 
the  laws  passed  was  one  providing  that  "rowdies  be  put  in  the  stocks 
for  two  hours  for  swearing,  quarrelling,  drinking  liquor,  or  singing 
vain  songs,  or  tunes,  on  the  Sabbath."  The  fixed  charges  for  "ordinar- 
ies," or  taverns,  to  furnish  a  meal  was  eight  pence,  and  for  pasturing  a 
horse  six  pence  a  day.  The  next  session  of  the  Assembly  was  held 
October  loth,  beginning  at  Woodbridge  on  that  day,  and  concluding  on 
19th  at  Elizabethtown. 

The  Township  Court  was  established  October  19,  1669,  with  the 
following  officers :  President,  Lieut.  John  Pike ;  Assistant,  John  Bishop, 
Sr.  In  the  following  March,  Thomas  Bloomfield  and  John  Martin  were 
appointed  grand  jurymen  "to  take  notice,  enquire  into  and  make  due 
presentment  of  all,  or  any  kind  of  misdemeanor  in  this  corporation,  and 
have  an  oath  administered  to  them  for  that  end."  The  Court  was  held 
in  a  building  on  the  site  where  Mrs.  F.  G.  Tisdall's  handsome  residence 
now  stands,  on  Rahway  avenue.  The  same  house,  many  years  after, 
became  the  Presbyterian  parsonage,  and  still  later  was  used  as  a  young 
ladies'  seminary,  conducted  by  the  Misses  Stevens.  The  jail  was  a 
separate  building  in  the  rear.  In  the  year  1675  a  stockade  of  logs  was 
built  around  the  latter,  partly  as  a  fortification  and  also  as  a  place  of 
refuge  for  the  women  and  children  in  case  of  a  threatened  attack  by 
the  Indians.  The  attack  never  took  place ;  and,  in  fact,  except  for  some 
petty  thieving,  the  red  men  never  seriously  annoyed  their  white  neigh- 


404  MIDDLESEX 

bors.  On  June  6,  167 1,  the  town  meeting  appointed  "two  Way  Wardens" 
to  attend  to  the  mending  of  the  roads.  John  Smith,  "Scotchman,"  here- 
tofore alluded  to,  was  a  man  of  such  remarkable  integrity  that  the  July 
town  meeting  directed  that  his  half-bushel  measure  should  be  the  stand- 
ard by  which  all  the  freeholders  should  be  governed  in  buying  and 
selling ;  "and  all  those  who  buy,  or  sell,  by  any  other  measure,  until  law 
makes  other  provision,  shall  be  accounted  villainous  to  buy,  or  sell  by 
unjust  measures."  A  great  tribute  to  the  man's  honesty.  May  his  tribe 
increase ! 

In  1675  the  General  Assembly,  which  must  have  been  imbued  with 
the  prejudice  of  their  English  forebears,  passed  an  ordinance  providing 
that  if  any  person,  male  or  female,  shall  be  found  to  be  a  witch,  he  or 
she  shall  be  put  to  death.  We  do  not  believe  that  any  one  was  ever 
executed  in  our  good  old  commonwealth  on  such  a  charge!  A  great 
change  was  made  in  the  government  of  the  Province  in  July,  1676.  Pre- 
viously Governor  Carteret's  jurisdiction  extended  from  Staten  Island 
Sound  to  the  Delaware  river,  and  from  Cape  May  to  the  hills  of  Bergen. 
By  agreement  between  the  Proprietors,  the  Province  was  divided,  form- 
ing the  provinces  of  East  and  West  Jersey.  The  partition  began  at 
Little  Egg  Harbor  (now  Ocean  county),  and  was  drawn  straight  across 
in  a  northwest  direction  until  it  reached  the  Delaware  river.  Wood- 
bridge  fell  on  the  east  side  of  the  boundary  and  remained  in  Carteret's 
jurisdiction. 

In  September,  1680,  Rev.  John  Allen,  of  England,  was  selected  as 
pastor  of  the  town  church,  which  was  built  five  years  before  on  what 
was  known  as  the  "Kirk  Green,"  near  the  spot  now  occupied  by  the 
Presbyterian  church.  He  was  succeeded  in  1686  by  Rev.  Archibald 
Riddell,  a  Scotchman,  who  ministered  until  1689,  and  was  followed  by 
Rev.  Samuel  Shepard,  who  was  pastor  until  1706.  In  1707  Rev.  Nathan- 
iel Wade  became  pastor  and  acted  as  such  until  1712,  when  he  was 
authoritatively  dismissed  from  the  charge  by  the  Presbytery  of  Phila- 
delphia, with  which  the  church  had  affiliated  in  1710.  Rev.  John  Pierson, 
son  of  Rev.  Abraham  Pierson,  of  Killingworth,  Conn.,  the  first  president 
of  Yale  College,  succeeded  to  the  pastorate  in  1714,  and  continued  as 
such  until  1754.  He  died  at  Hanover,  New  Jersey,  in  1770,  in  his 
eighty-first  year,  having  preached  the  gospel  for  fifty-six  years.  The 
evidence  that  the  church  became  Presbyterian  in  1710  is  sustained  by 
the  following  entry  in  the  Church  Book,  in  which  the  officers  of  a 
Presbyterian  form  of  government  are  mentioned  for  the  first  time: 
"March  28,  1710.  At  a  church  meeting  was  chosen  John  Foard,  John 
Pike  and  Thomas  Pike  for  Ruling  Elders  in  the  Church  of  Christ  in 
Woodbridge."  Rev.  Nathaniel  Whitaker,  of  New  York,  was  pastor  for 
five  years,  and  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Dr.  Azel  Roe,  of  Setauket,  Long 
Island,  in  the  autumn  of  1763,  who  continued  in  the  pastorate  until  his 
death  in  181 5,  a  period  of  fifty-two  years. 


WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  405 

Dr.  Roe  was  the  most  prominent  personality  in  Presbyterianism  of 
his  time  in  this  region,  a  faithful  pastor,  and  much  beloved  by  the 
entire  community.  An  excellent  portrait  and  a  handsome  memorial 
tablet  of  him  adorn  the  walls  of  the  present  church.  The  succeeding 
pastors  and  their  respective  terms  of  service  are  as  follows:  Rev.  Dr. 
Henry  Mills,  1816-21 ;  Rev.  William  B.  Barton,  1821-52;  Rev.  William  M. 
Martin,  1852-63 ;  Rev.  George  C.  Lucas,  1863-73 ;  Rev.  Dr.  J.  M.  McNulty, 
1874-1906;  Rev.  R.  W.  Mark,  1907-18;  and  the  present  incumbent.  Rev. 
Leonard  V.  Buschman,  who  came  to  the  church  in  1918.  The  present 
Session  is  as  follows :  Elders — James  P.  Prall,  J.  Edgar  Brown,  Howard 
A.  Tappen,  John  E.  Breckenridge,  Wm.  H.  Gardner,  Benj.  B.  Walling 
and  Asher  F.  Randolph.  Trustees— J.  E.  Breckenridge,  president ;  H.  A. 
Tappen,  treasurer;  Benj.  B.  Walling,  parish  clerk;  S.  Barron  Brewster, 
Sherman  B.  Demarest,  Hampton  Cutter  and  Theodore  Leber.  Deacons 
— C.  Roscoe  Chase,  William  Rowe  and  Charles  Mesick. 

The  charter  was  granted  by  King  George  H.,  of  England,  on  Septem- 
ber 8,  1756,  and  signed  also  by  Jonathan  Belcher,  Governor  of  the  Prov- 
ince, and  recorded  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  at  Perth  Amboy,  in 
Book  C  of  Commission  Charters,  page  5.  The  original  document  is  in 
the  possession  of  the  trustees  of  the  church.  The  present  edifice  was 
erected  in  1803,  and  no  change  has  since  been  made  in  its  outward 
appearance,  except  that  a  large  Sabbath  school  room  has  been  added  in 
the  rear.  The  cemetery  is  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  interesting  in 
the  State.  In  the  great  congregation  which  lie  buried  there  are  the 
remains  of  many  distinguished  men  and  heroic  women.  The  Revolu- 
tionary heroes,  Generals  Nathaniel  Heard  and  Clarkson  Edgar ;  Colonels 
Samuel  Crow  and  Benjamin  Brown ;  Major  Reuben  Potter ;  Captains 
Nathaniel  Fitz  Randolph,  David  Edgar,  Matthew  Sayers,  Ellis  Barron 
and  Abraham  Tappan ;  Lieutenant  James  Pa  ton,  and  a  great  host  of  the 
"rank  and  file,"  are  awaiting  in  the  quiet  resting  place  the  sound  of 
the  great  reveille.  Judge  Adam  Hude,  Major  Richard  Cutter,  Captain 
John  Pike,  James  Parker,  the  first  printer;  Drs.  John  G.  Wall  and 
Moses  Bloomfield,  Justice  Henry  Freeman,  Robert  Coddington  and 
David  Harriot,  are  names  that  appear  on  the  ancient  tombstones.  There, 
too,  is  the  grave  of  Mary,  wife  of  Caleb  Campbell,  and  daughter  of  Wil- 
liam and  Mary  Compton,  who  died  February  15,  1735,  the  first  white 
child  born  in  Woodbridge. 

In  1686,  Captain  John  Pike,  Nathaniel  Fitz  Randolph,  Samuel  Moore, 
Jonathan  Dunham,  and  Robert  McCleland  were  appointed  a  vigilance 
committee,  a  proceeding  for  which  we  can  imagine  only  two  reasons : 
Either  the  Piscataway  men  contemplating  another  raid  on  the  boundary 
line  between  the  townships;  or  disorder  was  so  prevalent  that  such  a 
measure  was  necessary  for  the  public  safety.  Many  highways  were  laid 
out  about  this  time,  notably  to  Perth  Amboy,  Rahway,  New  Brunswick,

Metuchen  and  Piscataway.  Samuel  Moore-  was  licensed  by  the  Cor- 
poration Court  to  keep  an  "ordinary,"  or  inn,  in  June,  1683,  which  was 
probably  kept  in  the  old  building  on  the  corner  of  Rahway  avenue  and 
Green  street.  Mr.  Moore  must  have  been  versatile  and  active,  as  we 
find  him  filling  the  following  offices  at  the  same  time :  High  sheriff  of 
the  county,  deputy  to  the  General  Assembly,  messenger  to  the  House  of 
Deputies,  town  clerk  and  collector  of  the  township,  and  hotel  keeper. 

Provision  for  a  free  public  school  was  made  in  the  early  days  of  the 
settlement,  and  was  named  in  the  charter  in  1669  as  an  object  for  the 
appropriation  of  public  land.  The  property  consisted  of  one  hundred 
acres,  a  short  distance  from  Iselin,  on  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  and  is 
better  known  as  the  "Poor  House  Farm;"  the  township  have  hired  the 
house  and  land  from  the  trustees  of  the  free  school  land,  and  use  it  as  an 
almshouse.  James  FuUerton,  who  came  to  the  township  in  1684,  taught 
the  first  school,  located  on  Cedar  brook.  John  Brown  and  George 
Eubanks  taught  successively  for  ten  years.  In  1793  the  Woodbridge 
Academy  was  built  by  private  subscription,  on  Rahway  avenue,  and  was 
removed  in  1851  to  give  place  to  a  public  school.  The  old  building  is 
still  standing  on  Main  street,  near  Rahway  avenue,  and  has  been  con- 
verted into  a  tenement. 

The  first  town  committee  was  chosen  March  30,  1705,  and  consisted 
of  Captain  John  Bishop,  Captain  Elisha  Parker,  John  Ilsley  (Inslee), 
Nathaniel  Fitz  Randolph,  John  Pike,  Joseph  Rolph  and  Thomas  Pike. 
They  were  elected  for  one  year,  and  to  act  for  the  town  in  all  matters 
except  the  disposition  of  land  and  the  raising  of  money.  At  this  meet- 
ing permission  was  given  to  Elisha  Parker  to  build  a  grist  mill  on 
Papiack  (Woodbridge)  creek.  This  was  the  second  mill,  the  first  having 
been  established  by  Jonathan  Dunham  in  1670.  The  old  Trinity  par- 
sonage, built  of  brick  brought  from  Holland,  was  the  residence  of  Dun- 
ham and  considered  at  that  time  the  finest  house  in  the  settlement. 

A  great  change  in  the  size  of  Papiack  creek  has  taken  place  since 
colonial  times.  Vessels  once  rode  at  anchor  in  the  stream  near  the 
site  of  the  former  Salamander  works,  on  Rahway  avenue.  Two  hundred 
years,  with  the  continual  deposit  of  sand  from  the  neighboring  clay 
mines,  have  choked  up  the  channel  and  narrowed  its  width  until  now 
it  is  only  a  miniature  of  what  it  once  was.  A  number  of  landings  for 
boats  were  established  in  1700  and  succeeding  years,  the  principal  ones 
being  Pierce's,  at  the  mouth  of  Papiack  creek,  where  the  C.  W.  Boynton 
dock  is;  the  "Corn  Field"  (now  Cutter's  dock);  Cortland,  supposed  to 
have  been  on  Smith's  creek ;  Vouquillen's,  nearly  opposite  Pierce's ;  and 
Bloomfield's,  on  the  west  side  of  the  creek,  near  the  upland.  It  is 
uncertain  whether  negro  slaves  were  brought  here  by  the  first  settlers ; 
but  the  traffic  in  slaves  began  at  a  very  early  period.  In  1680  there 
were  120  slaves  in  the  Province,  which  in  1737  had  increased  to  3,071-; 


WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  407 

the  Province  then  including  East  and  West  Jersey.  From  1700  to  1800, 
Woodbridge  was  greatly  interested  in  the  traffic,  and  records  of  the 
sales  of  Africans  are  frequently  found  in  manuscripts  relating  to  the 
town.  In  Gordon's  "Gazetteer  of  New  Jersey,"  page  29,  we  find  a  bill  of 
whereby  J.  Shoball  Smith,  of  Woodbridge,  in  consideration  of  the  sum 
of  £50  conveyed  to  Samuel  Smith,  of  the  same  place,  one  negro  woman 
named  Phebe.  The  general  law  abolishing  slavery  was  passed  in  the 
Province  in  1804,  and  thoroughly  enforced  in  1846. 

From  1738  to  1864  very  little  progress  was  made  in  the  township, 
largely  owing  to  the  fact  that  during  that  time  two  wars  had  been 
waged  between  England  and  France. 

A  distinguished  figure  in  the  township  about  1750  was  James  Parker, 
a  grandson  of  Elisha  Parker,  who  removed  from  Staten  Island  to  Wood- 
bridge  about  1675.  James  was  born  in  1714,  and  was  an  apprentice  to 
William  Bradford,  the  first  printer  in  New  York.  In  1751  he  established 
an  office  in  Woodbridge — the  first  printing  office  in  the  Province.  It  is 
believed  that  the  building  stood  near  the  corner  of  Perth  Amboy  avenue 
and  Grove  street,  where  the  late  Dr.  S.  P.  Harned's  former  residence  was 
located.  Parker  printed  the  "Legislative  Proceedings"  and  many  other 
public  documents,  and  in  1758  began  to  publish  the  "New  American 
Magazine,"  the  first  periodical  published  in  the  State.  It  was  published 
monthly  until  1760.  In  1755,  with  John  Holt,  of  New  York,  he  estab- 
lished a  press  at  New  Haven  and  printed  the  "Connecticut  Gazette," 
the  first  newspaper  in  the  State.  In  1761  Parker  printed  Nevill's  "I-aws 
of  New  Jersey,"  and  in  1764  a  "Conductor  Generalis,"  intended  as  a  guide 
to  justices  of  the  peace.  In  1765  he  transported  his  press  to  Burlington 
and  printed  Samuel  Smith's  "History  of  New  Jersey."  The  manuscript 
of  this  valuable  work  is  preserved  in  the  library  of  the  Historical  Society 
at  Newark,  a  volume  of  574  pages  printed  in  excellent  style.  Mr.  Parker 
was  postmaster  of  New  York  for  several  years,  and  at  the  time  of  his 
death,  July  2,  1770,  was  comptroller  and  secretary  for  the  Postal  De- 
partment of  the  Northern  District  of  the  British  Colonies.  He  died  at 
Burlington,  and  was  buried  in  the  Presbyterian  cemetery  at  Woodbridge. 
The  printing  office  was  burned  to  the  ground  by  a  band  of  Tories  during 
the  Revolution. 

As  early  as  1702,  George  Keith,  a  disafifected  Quaker,  was  sent  out 
as  a  missionary  by  the  English  Episcopalians.  He  came  to  Woodbridge, 
and  in  his  journal  he  speaks  of  his  visit  thus:  "Dec.  30,  1702,  preached  at 
Woodbridge  in  the  Independent  meeting  house,  at  the  desire  of  Rev. 
Mr.  Shepard  and  others.  After  sermon,  Mr.  Shepard  kindly  entertained 
us  at  his  house."  Mr.  Shepard  must  have  been  very  liberal-minded,  as 
he  was  the  town  preacher,  and  therefore  liable  to  the  jealousy  which 
existed  to  some  extent  in  that  time  in  every  denomination.  The  town 
had  no  other  Episcopal  missionary    until    171 1,    when    Rev.    Edward 


4o8  MIDDLESEX 

Vaughan,  responding  to  the  invitation  from  several  men  who  were  dis- 
satisfied with  Rev.  Nathaniel  Wade,  the  town  preacher,  began  to  visit 
and  minister  in  the  town,  preaching  in  private  houses;  and  finally  a 
congregation  of  Episcopalians  was  formed  in  the  above  year.  From  that 
time  until  1716,  services  were  held  in  private  houses,  and  sometimes  in 
a  new  church  which  had  been  built  upon  the  Green,  not  far  from  tfie 
Presbyterian  church,  but  which  was  never  finished.  Occasional  services 
were  held  by  different  clergymen  until  1754,  when  a  new  church  was 
built,  supposed  to  be  on  the  site  of  the  first,  which  remained  for  over 
one  hundred  years  and  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  1858.  Rev.  Robert  Mc- 
Kean  took  charge  of  the  church  in  1764,  and  was  succeeded  by  Rev. 
John  Preston. 

On  December  6,  1769,  a  charter  was  granted  to  Trinity  Church  by 
King  George  III.,  of  England,  and  signed  by  William  Franklin,  Governor 
of  the  Province,  the  wardens  being  Samuel  Jaques  and  Samuel  Tingley, 
and  the  following  vestrymen:  David  Alston,  Thomas  Hadden,  Joseph 
Dunham  and  Ebenezer  Forster.  During  the  Revolution  the  services 
were  abandoned,  and  in  1777  the  church  was  occasionally  used  as  a 
soldiers'  barracks.  Little  was  done  to  restore  the  services  until  1810. 
From  that  time  until  1830  Rev.  James  M.  Chapman  occasionally  offi- 
ciated. The  following  were  the  succeeding  rectors :  Rev.  William  Doug- 
las, 1830-38;  Rev.  Frederick  Ogilby,  1838-42;  Rev.  Hamble  J.  Leacock, 
1842;  Rev.  James  M.  Chapman  (missionary  service),  1843-57;  ^^v.  E.  A. 
Hoffman,  1858-62;  Rev.  P.  L.  Jaques,  1862-69;  Rev.  R.  C.  Mcllvaine, 
1869-72 ;  Rev.  J.  A.  Penniman,  1872 ;  Rev.  T.  Lewis  Banister,  1872.  The 
corner-stone  of  the  present  church,  the  third  on  the  same  site,  was  laid 
July  7,  i860,  and  consecrated  May  20,  1861,  by  Rt.  Rev.  Bishop  Oden- 
heimer,  of  the  Diocese  of  New  Jersey.  Among  those  who  served  as 
rectors,  succeeding  Rev.  T.  Lewis  Banister,  were  Revs.  Julian  Ingle, 
Howard  E.  Thompson,  Lewis  H.  Lighthipe,  R.  H.  Brestell,  J.  A.  Spring- 
sted.  Rev.  Scott  B.  Rathbun  and  Rev.  H.  H.  Gifford.  In  the  roll  of 
wardens  and  vestrymen  we  find  the  names  of  Jotham  Coddington,  George 
A.  HoUister,  Lorraine  Freeman,  Alanson  Newton,  Thomas  Barron, 
Captain  Forbes,  William  H.  Mawbey,  Henry  W.  Holton,  James  Blood- 
good,  William  E.  Fink,  John  B.  Osbourne,  George  C.  Hance,  William 
H.  Benton,  George  Lasslett  and  many  others.  The  present  vestrymen 
are:  John  H.  Love,  senior  warden;  James  McKeown,  junior  warden; 
vestrymen — Ivins  I.  Browne,  secretary-treasurer ;  James  Peoples,  Daniel 
Demarest,  Robert  Dunn  and  Mr.  Moran;  acting  rector.  Rev.  Walter  H. 
Stowe. 

For  several  years  previous  to  1669  there  was  trouble  between  the 
Lords  Proprietors  and  the  people  of  the  townships.  The  latter  denied 
that  the  former  had  any  right  to  rule,  and  desired  to  be  brought  directly 
under  the  Crown.    The  authority  of  the  Proprietors  was  set  at  naught

CLIFF    ROAD,    SEWAREN 


WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  409 

and  their  officers  were  openly  defied;  prisoners  in  their  charge  were 
rescued,  jails  were  broken  open  to  effect  the  release  of  criminals,  and 
chaos  reigned  over  the  Province.  The  disorder  reached  its  culmina- 
tion in  1701  to  such  an  extent  that  the  Lords  Proprietors  wearied  of  the 
struggle  and  in  the  following  year  surrendered  the  government  to  Queen 
Anne,  who  accepted  it  on  April  17,  1702,  and  henceforth  East  and  West 
Jersey  became  one  Province  and  known  as  New  Jersey,  Sir  Edward 
Hyde,  Lord  Cornbury,  being  the  first  Governor,  his  dominion  extending 
also  over  New  York.  The  last  English  governor  was  Sir  William  Frank- 
lin, a  son  of  the  great  Benjamin  Franklin,  and  had  his  residence  at  what 
is  now  known  as  the  Westminster  Hotel  on  Kearney  avenue,  Perth 
Amboy.  On  June  17,  1776,  Gen.  Na-thaniel  Heard,  of  Woodbridge, 
under  orders  from  Samuel  Tucker,  president  of  the  Provincial  Congress, 
arrested  the  Governor  and,  owing  to  his  refusal  to  give  his  parole,  com- 
mitted him  to  the  custody  of  Governor  Trumbull,  of  Connecticut,  by 
whom  he  was  held  as  a  prisoner  for  two  years  and  four  months,  when 
he  was  exchanged,  and  ultimately  returned  to  England. 

In  1824,  when  our  great  Revolutionary  ally.  Marquis  de  Lafayette, 
visited  the  United  States,  he  was  given  a  public  reception,  with  elaborate 
ceremonies,  on  the  Green  near  the  residence  of  Ernest  H.  Boynton. 
Professor  Stryker  made  an  address,  and  a  large  choir,  composed  of 
school  children  and  others,  sang  patriotic  songs.  The  distinguished  guest 
seemed  much  impressed  and  pleased  with  the  enthusiastic  demonstra- 
tion, testifying,  as  it  did,  to  the  gratitude  and  affection  of  the  descendants 
of  those  whose  independence  he  had  bravely  fought  to  achieve. 

Thomas  Barron,  a  native  of  Woodbridge,  and  a  retired  merchant, 
made  a  bequest  in  his  will  leaving  $50,000  to  build  and  maintain  a  public 
library  in  his  native  town.  In  1875  the  handsome  brownstone  building 
on  the  corner  of  Rahway  and  Carteret  avenues,  near  the  Presbyterian 
church,  was  completed  and  dedicated  with  proper  ceremonies.  It  con- 
tains a  large  number  of  volumes,  with  newspapers,  magazines,  and  other 
periodicals,  and  is  altogether  an  ornament  and  a  great  addition  to  the 
town.  The  first  trustees  werer  Dr.  John  C.  Barron  (the  founder's 
nephew).  Rev.  George  C.  Lucas,  pastor  of  the  Presbyterian  church,  and 
Dr.  Ellis  B.  Freeman.  Succeeding  members  of  the  board  were:  Judge 
Albert  D.  Brown,  Howard  Valentine,  William  Edgar  and  Thomas  and 
Ellis  Barron.  The  present  board  consists  of  Hampton  Cutter,  president ; 
John  H.  Love,  secretary;  James  E.  Berry,  treasurer;  Everitt  C.  Ensign 
and  S.  Barron  Brewster,  vice-presidents ;  librarian,  Mrs.  Percival  Logan. 

Prior  to  1865  the  only  communication  Woodbridge  had  with  the 
outside  world  was  by  walking,  riding,  driving,  and  the  steamboat  that 
plied  between  New  Brunswick  and  New  York,  stopping  at  points  on 
the  Raritan  river  and  Staten  Island  Sound ;  but  in  the  above  mentioned 
year  the  Pennsylvania  railroad  built  a  branch  road  from  Rahway  to 


4IO  MIDDLESEX 

Perth  Amboy,  with  stations  at  Woodbridge,  Avenel  and  Spa  Spring. 
Before  that  time  the  mail  was  carried  from  Rahway  to  Perth  Amboy  via 
Woodbridge,  by  wagon,  sleigh  or  horseback ;  and  the  writer  remembers 
seeing  the  genial  face  of  former  Sheriff  Convery,  of  Perth  Amboy,  who 
for  several  years  was  the  mail  carrier,  appearing  in  the  Woodbridge 
postofifice,  his  coat  covered  with  snow,  or  drenched  with  rain,  after  a 
three  and  a  half  mile  drive.  The  postoffice  was  successively  located 
in  the  old  building  on  the  corner  of  Rahway  avenue  and  Green  street; 
in  Alexander  A.  Edgar's  store,  nearly  opposite ;  in  M.  A.  Brown's  drug 
store,  on  Main  street ;  in  Masonic  Hall ;  and  again  on  Main  street.  For- 
mer postmasters  were:  John  E.  Barron,  H.  Barcalow,  Alex.  A.  Edgar, 
Jeremiah  Ten  Eyck,  Dr.  Samuel  E.  Freeman,  Marcus  A.  Brown,  David 
P.  Carpenter,  James  V.  Freeman,  Daniel  W.  Brown,  John  M.  Sutton, 
Samuel  Coddington  and  John  F.  Ryan. 

In  colonial  days  the  "Elm  Tree  Inn"  was  the  best  known  hotel  in 
Woodbridge.  It  was  located  on  Rahway  avenue,  adjoining  Mrs.  F.  G. 
Tisdall's  residence,  and  took  its  name  from  a  giant  elm  tree  whose 
branches  extended  half  way  across  the  avenue,  which  at  that  point  is 
quite  wide.  The  building  was  later  occupied  as  Prof.  Stryker's  select 
school,  and  still  later  as  the  college  preparatory  school  of  Professor 
Thomas  Harvey  Morris,  a  graduate  of  Princeton  College,  an  excellent 
teacher  and  a  Christian  gentleman.  In  common  with  many  others  who  had 
the  advantage  of  sitting  under  his  teachings,  we  reverently  and  lovingly 
say :  "May  he  rest  in  peace."  Another  prominent  hostelry  was  the  "Cross 
Keys  Tavern,"  on  the  northwest  corner  of  Main  street  and  Perth  Amboy 
avenue,  where  Mr.  Frank  Elias'  residence  now  stands.  It  was  there  that 
Gen.  Washington  passed  the  night  when  on  the  way  from  Philadelphia 
to  New  York,  on  the  occasion  of  his  first  inauguration  as  President. 
The  old  house,  changed  and  remodeled  out  of  all  resemblance  to  its 
former  appearance  and  converted  into  a  tenement,  is  still  standing  on 
Rahway  avenue,  in  the  rear  of  its  former  site.  The  Woodbridge  Hotel, 
at  the  junction  of  Rahway  avenue  and  Green  street,  is  the  remodeled 
old  "Pike  House,"  in  front  of  which  for  many  years  hung  a  swinging 
sign  bearing  a  picture  of  General  Zebulon  Montgomery  Pike,  the  dis- 
coverer of  Pike's  Peak,  Colorado,  who  was  killed  by  the  explosion  of 
a  magazine  at  the  battle  of  York  (Toronto),  Canada,  in  the  War  of  1812. 
In  the  early  days  the  elections,  the  township  committee,  and  all  public 
meetings  were  held  there. 

Woodbridge  produced  one  Governor  of  the  State,  Hon.  Joseph 
Bloomfield,  a  great  friend  of  Thomas  Jefferson,  an  efificient  chief  magis- 
trate and  a  man  of  fine  executive  ability,  who  served  from  1803  to  1812. 
He  was  the  son  of  Dr.  Moses  Bloomfield,  who  it  is  thought  resided  on 
Freeman  street,  in  the  house  owned  and  occupied  for  many  years  by 
the  late  George  C.  Hance.    The  following  inscription  upon  the  Doctor's 


WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  411 

monument  in  the  Presbyterian  cemetery  will  give  an  idea  of  his  promi- 
nence in  and  usefulness  to  the  community  and  the  country :  "Dr.  Moses 
Bloomfield,  40  years  a  Physician  and  Surgeon  in  this  Town;  Senior 
Physician  and  Surgeon  in  the  Hospitals  of  the  United  States;  Repre- 
sentative in  the  Provincial  Congress  and  the  General  Assembly;  an 
upright  Magistrate,  and  an  elder  in  the  Presbyterian  church." 

The  township  has  been  represented  in  the  State  Senate  by  Adam 
Lee,  Edward  Y.  Rogers  and  Amos  Robins ;  and  in  the  General  Assembly 
by  William  Edgar,  Samuel  Edgar,  John  M.  Tufts,  Ralph  M.  Crowell, 
William  C.  Alexander,  Thompson  Edgar,  Warren  Brown,  Joel  B.  Laing, 
Simeon  W.  Phillips,  Josephus  Shann,  Dr.  Ellis  B.  Freeman,  Alfred  W. 
Jones,  Charles  A.  Campbell,  Edward  S.  Savge,  Ephraim  Cutter  and  J.  H. 
Thayer  Martin. 

The  clays  of  Woodbridge  township  have  been  long  and  favorably 
known  to  manufacturers  throughout  the  country.  The  prominent  fac- 
tories now  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  clay  products  in  the  township 
are  the  following:  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother  Company,  fire  brick; 
Mutton  Hollow  Company,  fire  brick;  Anness  &amp;  Potter  Company,  fire 
brick  and  fire-proofing  material ;  National  Fire-Proofing  Company  (two 
plants),  and  the  Didier-March  Company,  both  at  Keasbey;  all  owning 
and  operating  their  own  clay  mines;  also,  the  Federal  Terra  Cotta 
Company,  at  Spa  Spring;  Abel  Hansen's  Porcelain  Works,  at  Fords; 
the  Woodbridge  Ceramic  Company,  on  the  road  from  Woodbridge  to 
Iselin ;  and  the  C.  W.  Boynton  Sewer  and  Drain  Tile  Works,  at  Sewaren ; 
these  last  named  obtain  their  clay  from  the  local  mines.  Thousands 
of  tons  of  clay  and  fire-sand  are  annually  shipped  to  New  York,  Phila- 
delphia, Boston;  Akron,  Ohio;  and  other  points,  the  principal  miners 
being  Hampton  Cutter,  James  P.  Prall  and  John  H.  Leisen.  All  these 
industries  furnish  employment  to  a  large  number  of  skilled  and  unskilled 
workmen,  and  add  materially  to  the  growth  and  prosperity  of  the  town- 
ship. The  Steel  Works  at  Avenel  is  a  new  and  thriving  industry,  and 
is  steadily  increasing  its  output. 

On  May  14,  1832,  Rev.  William  Granville,  pastor  of  the  Rahway 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  called  a  meeting  of  the  Methodists  of 
Woodbridge  in  the  Strawberry  Hill  school-house,  just  below  James  P. 
Prall's  residence,  when  a  society  was  formed,  with  the  following  trus- 
tees: Nathan  Harned,  president;  John  Valentine,  Peter  Moore,  Thomas 
Eddy,  Samuel  Gage  and  William  Noe.  Oh  September  8  of  the  same 
year,  a  frame  building  35x50  feet  was  erected  on  the  site  of  the  present 
parsonage,  the  circuit  of  the  new  church  embracing  Perth  Amboy, 
Metuchen  and  New  Dover,  the  pastor  being  Rev.  Isaac  N.  Felsh.  The 
membership  was  30,  which  in  the  following  year  was  increased  to  loi ; 
and  the  membership  of  the  entire  territory  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
parish  was  537.     Rev.  Wm.  Hanley  succeeded  Mr.  Felsh  and  in  1842, 


412  MIDDLESEX 

during  the  pastorate  of  Rev.  Curtis  Talley,  a  parsonage  was  built  on 
a  lot  donated  by  the  late  James  Valentine,  and  which  is  now  the  resi- 
dence of  J.  Wilbur  Drake.  The  corner-stone  of  the  present  church  was 
laid  on  June  2,  1870,  and  the  building  dedicated  free  of  debt  on  May 
25th  of  the  following  yea:r,  at  a  cost  of  $30,000.  The  old  church  was 
burned  October  3,  1876.  In  1882  the  present  parsonage  was  erected, 
and  the  handsome  Sunday  school  building  was  added  to  the  church 
in  1889,  at  a  combined  cost  of  $13,000.  Among  the  earlier  pastors  were 
Rev.  Dr.  Henry  A.  Buttz,  afterward  president  of  Drew  Theological 
Seminary ;  Revs.  J.  H.  Dailey,  S.  B.  Rooney,  J.  H.  Runyon,  E.  M.  Grif- 
fiths, J.  D.  Dickenson,  Enoch  Meacham,  P.  G.  Blight,  M.  L.  Gates  and 
others.  Among  the  most  prominent  men  of  the  church  in  bygone  days 
and  who  aided  largely  in  its  growth  and  development,  were  Samuel 
Dally,  James  Valentine,  William  H.  Berry,  James  Commoss,  Samuel 
E.  Ensign,  Lewis  C.  Potter,  Josiah  D.  Drake,  Thomas  G.  Alward,  Syl- 
vester Frazee,  William  Harned  and  many  others.  The  present  pastor 
is  Rev.  Levi  B.  McMickle.  Trustees — Samuel  E.  Potter,  Edward  W. 
Valentine,  James  J.  Livingood,  John  MacAuslin,  Alexander  H.  Sutton, 
Edgar  Kreutzberg  and  Dr.  I.  T.  Spencer. 

In  i860  Rev.  Thomas  Quinn,  parish  priest  of  Rahway,  began  to 
hold  religious  services  in  the  homes  of  Patrick  Masterson,  John  Dunn, 
and  in  other  houses  in  Woodbridge.  Later  on.  Father  Quinn  purchased 
a  lot  on  Main  street,  and  after  many  difficulties  erected  thereon  a  frame 
building  which  did  duty  as  a  church  until  the  present  handsome  edifice 
was  built  in  1887.  The  former  church  has  been  used  continuously  as  a 
parish  school  since  that  time.  Father  Quinn  was  relieved  of  the  Wood- 
bridge  mission  in  1863,  and  it  was  attached  to  the  Perth  Amboy  parish 
and  ministered  to  by  Father  Cornell  until  1865,  when  the  latter  left 
Perth  Amboy  and  Father  Quinn  was  again  placed  in  charge  of  Perth 
Amboy  and  Woodbridge;  he  also  established  the  Catholic  cemetery 
in  the  township.  In  1871  Rev.  Peter  L.  Connolly,  parish  priest  of  Perth 
Amboy,  took  charge  of  the  Woodbridge  mission  until  succeeded  by  Rev. 
Stephen  Bettoni,  who  became  the  first  resident  pastor  and  remained 
as  such  until  1882,  when  he  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  James  F.  Devine, 
who  in  turn  was  succeeded  in  the  year  following  by  Rev.  James  Walsh, 
of  Long  Branch,  who  built  the  first  rectory.  Owing  to  some  difficulties 
with  the  people.  Father  Walsh  was  removed,  and  Father  Devine,  who 
was  very  popular,  returned  to  Woodbridge,  secured  the  present  rectory, 
built  the  new  church  and  a  convent  for  the  Sisters  in  1887.  In  1893 
Father  Devine  was  promoted  to  the  more  important  parish  of  the  Sacred 
Heart,  in  New  Brunswick,  where  he  died  several  years  ago.  He  was 
succeeded  in  Woodbridge  by  Rev.  Joseph  Flanagan,  who,  after  a  short 
pastorate,  died  here,  and  was  followed  by  Rev.  John  J.  Griffin,  who 
remained  here  until  his  death  in  1918.    Rev.  R.  J.  O'Farrell,  the  present

WOODBRIDGE  TOWNSHIP  413 

incumbent,  was  placed  in  charge  November  6,  1918.  When  Father 
Devine  announced  his  intended  removal  to  New  Brunswick,  nine-tenths 
of  the  representative  people  of  the  township,  irrespective  of  creed,  signed 
a  petition  to  the  Bishop  requesting  the  retention  of  the  reverend  gentle- 
man. During  Father  Griffin's  pastorate  the  twenty-fifth  anniversary  of 
his  admission  to  the  priesthood  occurred,  and  the  citizens  generally 
commemorated  the  occasion  by  tendering  him  a  complimentary  recep- 
tion and  banquet  in  the  Woodbridge  Athletic  Association's  club  room. 

A  company  of  ladies  and  gentlemen  consisting  mainly  of  former 
members  of  the  Presbyterian  church,  assembled  at  the  residence  of 
John  White,  on  Green  street,  September  30,  1874,  and  organized  a 
Congregational  church  and  society.  The  meeting  was  presided  over 
by  James  P.  Edgar,  with  George  W.  Dally  acting  as  secretary,  the  fol- 
lowing officers  being  elected:  Deacons — James  P.  Edgar,  Lewis  D. 
Kelly  and  Daniel  S.  Voorhees,  Jr.;  trustees — Edward  J.  Thompson, 
C.  A.  Campbell,  John  White,  G.  Frederick  Fink,  Matthias  Vanderveer, 
Wm.  W.  Selleck  and  J.  Mattison  Melick,  treasurer;  George  W.  Dally, 
clerk.  A  certificate  of  incorporation  was  filed  in  the  county  clerk's  office 
in  the  name  of  "The  First  Congregational  Church  of  Woodbridge."  The 
first  religious  services  were  held  in  Masonic  Hall,  October  11,  1874,  and 
continued  to  be  held  in  that  place  until  the  church  was  built.  A  con- 
stitution for  the  church  and  society  and  a  confession  of  faith  was 
adopted  October  28,  1874,  and  a  council  of  Congregational  churches 
formally  recognized  the  new  church  on  November  17th.  Rev.  S.  Lee 
Hillyer  was  installed  as  pastor  on  June  3,  1875,  ^"^  served  as  such  until 
his  death,  November  22,  1877.  The  church,  on  the  comer  of  Barron 
and  Grove  avenues,  was  completed  and  dedicated  June  29,  1876,  Rev.  Dr. 
George  H.  Hepworth,  of  New  York,  preaching  the  sermon.  A  memorial 
bell  was  presented  to  the  church  by  Francis  A.  Ostrander,  of  Troy, 
New  York,  in  memory  of  his  father.  In  October,  1876,  the  church  was 
relieved  from  debt  by  a  bequest  of  the  late  Mrs.  Jane  Doremus,  a  sister 
of  Thomas  Barron,  founder  of  the  Public  Library.  The  membership 
increased  from  41  in  1874  to  99  in  1877.  R^v.  A.  R.  Shaw  was  pastor 
from  June  27,  1878,  until  August  i,  1880,  when  he  was  succeeded  by 
Rev.  Charles  Noble,  who  resigned  in  August,  1888,  to  accept  a  college 
professorship  in  Charles  City,  Iowa.  The  following  pastors  served  the 
church  during  succeeding  years:  William  H.  Hopkins,  November  7, 
1889-February,  1892 ;  Charles  H.  McDonald,  June  9,  1892-June  30,  1894 ; 
and  Thomas  C.  Miller,  November  6,  i894-April  i,  1901,  all  graduates  of 
Union  Theological  Seminary,  of  New  York.  Rev.  Wm.  H.  Jackson 
served  from  1901  to  1907,  and  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Maurice  J.  Kain, 
who  remained  about  one  year  and  was  followed  by  his  father,  Rev.  Dr.  P. 
J.  Kain,  who  was  pastor  until  his  death  in  191 3.  In  the  last  mentioned 
year  the  new  parsonage  adjoining  the  church  was  erected.    On  Febru-

In  1838,  when  Mercer  county  was  created,  a  considerable  portion 
of  this  township,  on  a  part  of  which  Princeton  is  situated,  was  set  off 
as  a  part  of  the  new  county ;  and  again,  in  1857,  another  portion  of  the 
land  was  allotted  to  the  new  county  of  Union.  In  1870  Raritan  township 
was  formed,  the  territory  being  taken  in  equal  parts  from  Woodbridge 
and  Piscataway  townships.  Prior  to  this,  all  of  Lower  Rahway  (the 
part  lying  south  of  the  Rahway  river),  belonged  to  Woodbridge,  and 
the  people  of  that  locality,  and  also  of  Metuchen,  Bonhamtown  and 
neighboring  localities,  came  to  the  old  "Pike  House,"  in  Woodbridge, 
to  cast  their  vote  at  the  elections.    In  1906  the  borough  of  Roosevelt 


4i6  MIDDLESEX 

was  formed,  which  took  another  portion  of  the  township,  six  square 
miles ;  and  yet,  with  all  the  cutting  and  carving  that  has  been  done  for 
the  past  eighty-two  years,  Woodbridge  is  still  a  large  and  prosperous 
township. 

The  military  rolls  and  war  activities  of  Woodbridge  township  are 
epitomized  in  the  Appendix  Chapter. 

Piscataway  Township — Piscataway  and  Woodbridge  townships  were 
settled  about  the  same  time — 1665 ;  but  the  latter  was  incorporated  in 
1669,  and  the  former  not  until  1798.  The  township  is  about  eight  miles 
long  and  six  wide,  and  is  bounded  north  by  the  city  of  Plainfield,  Union 
county,  east  by  Raritan  township,  south  by  Raritan  river  and  west  by 
North  Plainfield,  Somerset  county.  A  small  portion  of  the  township 
was  taken  for  the  formation  of  Raritan  township  in  1870,  and  of  Plain- 
field  township  in  1847.  Piscataway  was  the  name  of  an  Indian  tribe  in 
Maine,  and  also  of  a  river  on  the  boundary  line  of  Maine  and  New  Hamp- 
shire. It  is  recorded  that  Hugh  Dunn,  Hopewell  and  Benjamin  Hull, 
Charles  and  John  Oilman,  Robert  Dennis,  John  Smith  and  John  Martin, 
who  came  from  Piscataqua,  were  granted  Dec.  18,  1666,  the  right  as 
Associates,  and  they  conferred  upon  the  township  the  name  of  the 
place  whence  they  came ;  and  it  was  known  as  Piscataqua  for  a  consider- 
able period  after  its  settlement. 

The  earliest  authentic  history,  gathered  from  the  public  records, 
states  that  the  large  tract  of  land  on  the  east  side  of  the  Raritan  river, 
which  comprises  the  townships  of  Woodbridge,  Piscataway  and  Eliza- 
bethtown,  was  bought  from  the  Indians  in  1664,  the  purchasers  being 
John  Bailey,  Daniel  Denton,  Luke  Watson  and  others,  who  obtained 
a  patent  from  Governor  Nicolls,  who  acted  under  the  Duke  of  York, 
afterward  James  II.,  of  England.  The  names  of  the  first  settlers  on 
record,  commencing  in  1665  and  continuing  to  1689,  were  the  Gilmans, 
Blackwells,  Blackfords,  Dunns,  Drakes,  Titsworths,  Hulls,  Martins, 
Langstafifs,  Dennis,  Dunhams,  Fitz  Randolphs,  Fields,  Mannings, 
Coriells,  Boices,  Runyons,  Giles,  Garretsons,  Wilsons,  Daytons,  Cod- 
dingtons,  Smalleys,  Clarkes,  Dotys  (Doughty),  La  Flowers  (Laforges), 
Higgins,  Fords,  Suttons,  Mownes,  Smiths,  Brinleys,  Davis',  Grubbs, 
Slaters  (Slaughter),  Chandlers,  Pridmores,  Hands,  Hendricks,  Wolfs, 
Hansworths,  Pounds,  Mollesons,  Bonhams,  McDaniels,  and  others. 
Some  of  these  remained  but  for  a  short  time.  The  earliest  records  of  the 
township  are  dated  June  25,  1675. 

Many  of  the  original  purchasers  of  land  are  still  represented  by  their 
descendants.  The  annals  of  the  Field  family  in  this  country  date  back 
to  1638,  when  the  original  ancester  came  from  England  with  Roger 
Williams  and  settled  in  Newport,  R.  I.  John  Field  came  to  New  Jersey 
and  located  on  a  tract  of  1,055  acres,  lying  between  Bound  Brook  and 
New  Brunswick,  along  the  Raritan  river,  in  Piscataway  township.     In 


PISCATAWAY  TOWNSHIP  417 

1774  Michael  Field  was  a  delegate  to  the  convention  at  New  Brunswick 
to  consult  concerning  the  points  of  difference  between  Great  Britain 
and  the  Colonies.    One  of  the  family  was  a  lieutenant  in  the  First  Regi- 
ment of  Middlesex  county,  and  another  lost  his  life  at  the  battle  of 
Monmouth.     Michael  left  a   legacy,   before    1800,  to   establish   a  free 
school  at  Bound  Brook.    Hopewell  and  Benjamin  Hull  were  prominent 
residents  in  1682,  holding  township  offices  and  owners  of  large  tracts 
of  land.     The  former  died  in  1693.     Henry,  or  Hendrick,  Garretson, 
was  of  Dutch  descent  and  came  to  this  country  in  1658  on  the  vessel, 
the   "Gilded   Beaver."     The  first  of  the   Mannings   in  the   records   is 
Jeffrey  in  1683.     His  granddaughter  married  Robert  Blackwell,  one  of 
the  early  settlers  in  East  Jersey.     In  1874  Alexander  Manning  was  a 
chosen  freeholder  and  held  other  responsible  offices.    John  Smalley  is 
named  as  a  freeholder  and  owner  of  herds  of  horses  and  cattle  in  1691 ; 
the  family  came  from  Newport,  R.  I.,  about  1668,  and  are  mentioned 
as  among  the  first  organizers  of  the  Seventh  Day  Baptist  church  in 
1720.    John  Martin  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  township  and  came 
from  Dover,  N.  H.    The  family  is  still  well  represented  in  this  vicinity. 
The  Gilman  family  owned  land  near  where  the  Landing  Bridge  crosses 
the  Raritan  river.     Daniel,  David,  Luke,  Edmund,  Nehemiah  and  Jere- 
miah are  the  first  names  of  the  Dunham  family,  who  came  from  Piscatn- 
qua,  Maine,  or  Dover,  N.  H.,  where  they  landed  from  the  ship  "James," 
in  1630  or  1632.    Edmund  was  the  first  pastor  of  the  Seventh  Day  Bap- 
tist church,  a  sketch  of  which  will  be  found  further  on.     John  Fitz 
Randolph  is  first  recorded  as  a  freeholder  in  1683,  owning  a  large  amount 
of  land.    The  family  was  prominent  in  civil  and  military  affairs  in  this 
and  other  townships.    In  1749  David  was  chosen  freeholder  and  Joseph 
held  the  same  office  for  four  years.     Capt.  Samuel  was  a  town  officer 
and  served  in  the  militia  in  1780.     Malachi  was  town  clerk  in  1765. 
Edward  Slater  was  a  freeholder  in  1683,  and  the  first  clerk  of  the  county 
courts.     Vincent  Rugnion  (Runyon)  was  a  French  Huguenot  and  is 
mentioned  in  1683,  when  he  had  allotted  to  him  154  acres  on  the  Raritan 
river.    Mather  Giles  was  among  the  first  settlers,  and  owned  farms  near 
Ambrose  brook  in  1699.     Benjamin  Clarke  and  Daniel  McDaniel  are 
spoken  of  in  1683  as  owning  lands  at  Samptown,  near  South  Plainfield, 
and  operated  a  sawmill.    Hezekiah  Bonham  was  located  near  the  Green 
brook.     William  Clawson  was  a  freeholder  in  1690.    The  family  came 
from  Staten  Island,  and  Capt.  John  was  in  the  Jersey  brigade  at  Albany, 
New  York,  in  May,  1776.    The  Boice  family  were  of  French  extraction, 
and  probably  settled  in  this  township  about  1720,  on  land  near  the  River 
road;  John  and  George  are  recorded  as  soldiers  in  the  Revolutionary 
War.     The  Koriells  (Coriells)  were  among  the  earliest  settlers,     'i  he 
Daytons  came  from  Southampton,  Long  Island,  in  1686. 

The  first  land  granted  by  the  township  was  to  Jodiah  Higgins,  two

acres,  laid  out  by  John  Langstaflf,  Benjamin  Hull  and  Godfrey  Manning, 
dated  January  i,  1682,  and  signed  by  Lieut.  Edward  Slater,  town  clerk, 
A  book,  over  250  years  old,  is  filled  with  the  "ear  marks"  of  cattle.  At 
that  day  there  were  no  inclosures  for  stock,  and  horses,  cattle  and  swine 
fed  at  will  upon  hundreds  of  acres,  and  each  owner's  name  and  ear  marks 
were  recorded  to  prevent  mistakes  that  might  arise  in  identifying  the 
stock. 

A  committee  was  appointed  in  1689  to  confer  with  Hopewell  Hull 
concerning  the  completion  of  the  Town  House,  and  if  he  refused  to 
finish  it  that  the  committee  be  empowered  to  employ  help'  to  do  the 
work.  In  1693  Capt.  Francis  Drake,  Thomas  F.  Randolph,  Benjamin 
Hull,  Isaac  Smalley  and  Edward  Slater  were  elected  Select  Men  to  man- 
age the  town  affairs.  In  1786,  March  14,  the  first  record  appears  of  the 
appointment  of  a  committee  of  accounts,  which  in  three  or  four  years 
after  was  styled  the  Town  Committee.  The  first  three  were  Dr.  Free- 
man, William  Tinbrook  (Ten  Broeck),  and  Jacob  Martin.  The  first 
additional  officers  were:  Edward  Slater,  town  clerk;  John  Oilman  and 
Edward  Slater,  assessors;  George  Drake,  collector;  James  Manning 
and  William  Hodgson,  chosen  freeholders;  John  Royce,  justice  of  the 
peace ;  Hopewell  Hull  and  John  Gilman,  deputies  to  the  General  Assem- 
bly. In  1732  fifteen  pounds  sterling  were  ordered  to  be  raised  for  the 
relief  of  the  poor.  A  pair  of  stocks  were  ordered,  to  be  kept  in  the 
usual  place,  from  which  it  is  to  be  inferred  that  they  had  previously 
been  in  use.  There  was  an  excise  tax  on  tavern-keepers  in  1742,  and 
the  following  landlords  paid  the  license  fee :  John  Hull,  Joseph  Michiel, 
Elijah  Dunham,  George  Vroom,  Aaron  Boorum,  James  Gilman,  Hugh 
and  John  Dunn,  Joseph  Drake,  Samuel  Moores,  Joseph  Wood,  John 
Pound  and  Thomas  Fitz  Randolph. 

The  inhabitants  were  very  patriotic  during  the  Revolution.  In 
the  roster  of  Continental  troops  we  find  the  names  of  Micajah  Dunn, 
lieutenant-colonel;  John  Dunn  and  Samuel  Randolph,  majors;  Thomp- 
son Stelle,  Hugh  Dunn  and  Jacob  Van  Deventer,  captains ;  Jere.  Field, 
lieutenant,  and  Benjamin  and  Richard  Field,  William  French,  David, 
Benjamin  and  Nathaniel  Martin ;  James  Bishop,  John  Langstaff,  Robert 
Kip ;  Daniel,  Benjamin  and  Jere.  Dunn ;  Hendrick  Smock,  John  Shippey. 
Peter  Schenck,  Henry  Fouratt,  Andrew  and  David  Manning,  Charles 
Suydam,  Richard  Merrill,  John  Smalley,  Joseph  Stelle,  Henry  Sutton, 
Jonathan  Sharp,  Simon  Van  Nortwick,  James  Woodin,  Samuel  Walker, 
Thomas  Webster  and  Samuel  Whitehead.  The  British  troops  occupied 
Piscataway,  Woodbridge,  Bonhamtown,  Six  Mile  and  Middlebush  from 
December  2,  1776,  till  June  22nd  of  the  following  year.  On  the  last 
named  day  they  retreated,  by  way  of  Piscataway,  to  Perth  Amboy, 
burning  many  houses  and  barns,  and  robbing  the  people  in  the  course 
of  their  march. 


PISCATAWAY  TOWNSHIP  419 

Many  farms,  in  early  days,  had  plots  of  ground  set  apart  as  a  family 
burial  ground.  The  Runyons,  Dunns,  Tingleys  and  Boices  burial 
grounds  date  back  to  the  first  settlement.  The  Waterville  Cemetery,  at 
old  Samptown,  is  one  of  the  oldest  cemeteries,  and  kept  in  excellent 
condition. 

John  Dunn  was  a  member  of  the  Provincial  Congress  in  1775-6. 
In  1844  the  title  of  the  Upper  House  of  the  Legislature  was  changed  to 
the  Senate.  Samuel  Fitz  Randolph,  Benjamin  Manning,  Ephraim  Mar- 
tin and  James  T.  Dunn  were  members  of  that  body.  Among  the  mem- 
bers of  the  General  Assembly  have  been:  Alexander  and  David  Dunn, 
George  Boice,  James  and  Lewis  Randolph,  David  Vail,  Elias  and  Albert 
L.  Runyon,  George  Molleson,  John  D.  Field,  Samuel  Stelle,  Abram  and 
Israel  Coriell  and  Joseph  C.  Letson. 

One  of  the  oldest  schools  in  the  township  occupied  the  site  of  what 
is  now  known  as  the  Whittier  school  in  Dunellen.  The  earliest  record 
of  it  is  1800,  when  Ransom  Downs,  a  New  England  peddler,  was  the 
teacher.  The  school  house  was  rebuilt  in  1841,  and  in  1875  a  fine  brick 
building,  of  two  stories,  was  erected.  The  New  Brooklyn  (South  Plain- 
field)  school  was  among  the  first  established,  and  James  Fullerton, 
who  lived  in  the  Short  Hills,  near  piainfield,  is  said  to  have  taught  here, 
and  in  other  portions  of  the  county.  Neil  Campbell,  who  is  buried  in  the 
old  Presbyterian  cemetery  at  Metuchen,  was  also  one  of  the  teachers. 
There  was  an  old  school  in  what  was  known  as  Fieldville,  on  the  road 
from  New  Market  to  the  Raritan  Landing,  and  among  the  teachers 
appear  the  names  of  Field,  Coriell,  Brokaw,  Smith  and  others,  familiar 
in  the  olden  days  throughout  the  township. 

The  first  Seventh  Day  Baptist  church  in  this  country  originated 
at  Newport,  Rhode  Island,  and  the  first  Sabbath  keeper  was  Stephen 
Mumford,  who  came  from  England  as  a  missionary  forty-four  years  after 
the  landing  of  the  Pilgrim  Fathers.  He  contended  that  the  Ten  Com- 
mandments, as  they  were  delivered  from  Mt.  Sinai,  were  moral  and  im- 
mutable, and  that  it  was  the  anti-Christian  power,  which  thought  to 
change  times  and  laws,  that  changed  the  Sabbath  from  the  seventh  to 
the  first  day  of  the  week.  About  1700,  Edmund  Dunham,  one  of  the 
first  settlers  of  the  township,  reproved  a  person  for  laboring  on  Sunday. 
On  being  asked  for  his  authority  from  the  Scriptures,  he  became 
satisfied;  while  searching  for  such  authority,  that  the  seventh  day  is 
the  only  Sabbath  in  the  Bible,  and  he  began  so  to  observe  it.  Soon 
others  followed  his  example  and  in  1707  a  Seventh  Day  Baptist  church 
was  organized  in  the  township,  with  about  seventeen  members.  Edmund 
Dunham  was  chosen  Elder.  Previous  to  that,  we  learn  from  the  first 
record  on  the  church  book,  Mr.  Dunham  had  been  sent  by  the  church 
to  Westerly,  Rhode  Island,  for  ordination,  which  he  received  from 
Elder  William    Gibson,    September    8,    1705.      Benjamin    Martin    was 


420  MIDDLESEX 

chosen  Deacon  in  the  following  December.  It  is  impossible,  at  this 
date,  to  tell  how  many  members  this  church  had,  from  the  manner  in 
which  the  records  were  kept.  The  following  family  names  appear  en 
the  records,  members  of  which  were  connected  with  the  church  prior  to 
1722: 

Martin,  Doty,  Dunn,  Cummins,  Fitz  Randolph,  Dunham,  Davis, 
Krith,  Smalley,  Hull,  Lennox,  Chandler,  Pyatt,  Noble,  Woodin,  Lee, 
Alger,  Sutton  and  Drake.  Edmund  Dunham  died  in  March  1734.  in  his 
seventy-third  year,  and  is  supposed  to  have  been  buried  in  the  old 
burying  ground,  adjoining  the  church,  but  no  monument  marks  the 
spot.  During  his  lifetime  the  services  were  held  in  private  houses; 
but  in  1736  the  first  house  of  worship  was  built,  about  a  mile  from  the 
village  of  New  Market.  On  March  10,  1777,  the  pastor.  Elder  Jonathan 
Dunham,  son  of  Edmund,  died,  aged  83  years.  The  second  meeting 
house  was  built  on  the  site  of  the  former  one  in  1802,  by  JonatVian  Len- 
nox, and  the  old  building  given  to  Elder  McLaferty  to  use  as  a  barn. 
In  1836  the  present  church  was  built  near  New  Market,  and  about  a 
mile  and  one-half  from  the  original  location.  It  is  38x51  feet,  with  large 
galleries,  cost  about  $3,600  and  was  dedicated  in  February,  1837.  In  the 
following  year  56  members  were  dismissed  to  a  Plainfield  church,  reduc- 
ing the  church  to  a  membership  of  about  140.  The  church  has,  at  the 
present  writing,  fifty  active  members.  The  pastors,  as  far  as  we  have 
been  able  to  secure  their  names,  in  addition  to  the  Dunhams,  father  and 
son,  are:  Elders,  Nathan  Rogers,  Henry  McLaferty,  Gideon  Woodin, 
William  B.  Maxon,  Walter  B.  Gillette,  Halsey  H.  Baker,  Lester  C. 
Rogers,  Lewis  A.  Piatt,  L.  E.  Livermore,  Henry  Jordan,  Herbert  Po'an 
and  Willard  D.  Burdick,  who  came  to  the  parish  about  two  years  ago. 

The  Baptist  church  was  constituted  in  1852  by  a  number  of  members 
from  the  Stelton,  Plainfield  and  South  Plainfield  churches.  It  is  a  large 
and  solid  frame  building  on  the  main  street  from  Dunellen  to  New 
Market.  The  following  have  been  the  pastors :  Revs.  William  D.  Hires, 
George  W.  Clark,  Isaac  N.  Hill,  Everett  Jones,  Revs.  Levi,  Osborn  and 
Grinnell,  and  the  present  incumbent.  Rev.  D.  Heyliger. 

The  Protestant  Episcopal  Church  af  the  Holy  Innocents  purchased 
the  building  they  now  occupy,  near  the  Baptist  church,  from  the  Metho- 
dists in  1872,  and  it  was  consecrated  by  Bishop  Odenheimer  in  1881. 
Rev.  Arthur  Phelps,  the  acting  rector,  resides  in  Bound  Brook.  The 
membership  is  quite  small. 

The  village  of  New  Market,  in  its  early  settlement,  was  known  as 
"Quibbletown,"  and  in  Gordon's  "Gazetteer  of  New  Jersey,"  he  speaks 
of  it  by  that  name,  and  also  of  its  being  called  New  Market  in  1834.  It 
is  about  seven  miles  north  of  New  Brunswick,  on  the  left  bank  of  Cedar 
creek,  as  it  was  formerly  called,  and  has  a  postoflice,  school,  store,  grist 
mill,  hotel,  and  about  125  dwellings.  The  Lehigh  Valley  railroad  passes 
through  the  centre  of  the  village.

South  Plainfield,  a  hamlet  formerly  known  as  New  Brooklyn,  is  on 
the  Lehigh  Valley  railroad,  and  about  two  miles  from  Plainfield.  It 
has  a  school  house,  postoffice,  store,  and  about  25  or  30  dwellings. 

The  following  are  the  township  officials :  George  W.  Coriell,  assessor ; 
William  Hamilton,  collector;  Abram  J.  Nelson,  president;  Henry  J. 
Manning  and  Walter  G.  Dunn,  town  committee ;  Charles  S.  Day.  clerk ; 
Dr.  W.  J.  Nelson,  physician ;  Rene  P.  V.  Von  Minden,  counsel ;  Cornelius 
J.  McCarthy,  chief  of  police. 


CHAPTER  XXX. 

NORTH   BRUNSWICK,   EAST   BRUNSWICK  AND    SOUTH 
BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIPS. 

North  Brunswick  was  among  the  first  townships  organized  after  the 
formation  of  Middlesex  county  and  the  permanent  estabHshment  of 
the  local  government  of  the  same.  The  township  was  formerly  em- 
braced within  the  borders  of  the  older  township  of  Piscataway,  and 
early  in  the  nineteenth  century  was  referred  to  in  township  records  of 
North  Brunswick  as  the  "North  Ward  of  New  Brunswick;"  but  since 
1803  it  has  universally  been  mentioned  by  its  present  title.  Until  i860, 
New  Brunswick  was  within  the  township  limits  of  North  Brunswick, 
and  the  town  meetings  were  generally  held  there.  By  an  act  of  the 
Assembly  approved  February  28,  i860,  New  Brunswick  was  separated 
from  North  Brunswick,  and  a  large  portion  of.  the  township  set  ofT  to 
form  a  part  of  East  Brunswick  township,  then  erected.  North  Bruns- 
wick, as  originally  surveyed,  contained  23,000  acres;  but  by  the  land 
set  off,  as  above  mentioned,  its  dimensions  were  reduced  to  8,256  acres. 
It  is  bounded  north  by  New  Brunswick,  east  by  East  Brunswick,  south 
by  South  Brunswick,  and  west  by  Franklin  township,  Somerset  county. 
The  surface  is  level,  and  much  of  it  under  a  good  state  of  cultivation, 
Lawrence  brook  and  its  tributaries,  and  One-Mile  run  providing  excel- 
lent drainage.  The  first  named  stream  is  very  important,  having  its 
source  in  South  Brunswick  township,  flowing  northeasterly,  separating 
North  from  East  Brunswick,  and  empties  into  the  Raritan  at  the  eastern 
extremity  of  New  Brunswick.  The  Pennsylvania  railroad  crosses  tiie 
township  from  near  its  northern  to  its  southern  border. 

One  of  the  oldest  families  is  that  of  Voorhees  (originally  known  as 
Van  Voorhees),  emigrating  from  Holland  in  1660,  settling  first  in  Long 
Island  and  coming  to  New  Brunswick  at  a  very  early  date.  Jaques  V.an 
Liew,  Nicholas  Bodine  (from  whom  Bodine's  Corners  takes  its  name), 
and  Frederick  Oucalt  were  early  residents.  Jeromous  and  Cornelius 
Vanderbilt  lived  near  Milltown  at  first,  and  then  removed  to  New 
Brunswick.  John  Ryder  lived  along  Lawrence  brook,  in  the  north- 
western part  of  the  township.  He  bought  144  acres  from  Cornelius 
Longfield,  once  owned  by  Thomas  Lawrence,  and  it  passed  to  his  heirs. 
Christian  and  Simeon  Van  Nortwick  also  lived  along  Lawrence  brook. 
Martin  Stevenson,  Cornelius  Tunison  and  James  Bennit  were  settlers 
considerably  earlier  than  1800.  Cornelius  De  Hart  purchased  210  acres 
from  the  Indians,  which  he  was  afterward  compelled  to  repurchase  from 
the  Proprietors.  Rev.  Dr.  Ira  Condict,  fourth  pastor  of  the  New  Bruns- 
wick First  Reformed  church,  removed  to  a  farm  near  Milltown  in  1798.

The  names  of  Harle  Farmer,  Thomas  Letson,  Jacob  I.  Bergen,  Enos 
Ayres,  Peter  Gordon,  Nicholas  Booraem,  James  Connet,  Isaac  J.  Wil- 
liamson, Peter  O.  Buckalew,  Thomas  Vanderveer,  Richard  Snedeker, 
David  P.  Messeroll  and  others  figure  in  the  early  records  of  the  town- 
ship. 

The  first  records  of  the  township  are  contained  in  a  book  devoted 
to  the  preservation  of  the  minutes  of  the  successive  town  meetings,  the 
first  entry  being  dated  December  23-24,  1800,  and  is  a  record  of  the  elec- 
tion of  five  men  as  Representatives  in  Congress  for  the  State  of  New 
Jersey,  in  the  North  Ward  of  New  Brunswick,  the  successful  candidates 
being  Franklin  Davenport,  Aaron  Ogden,  James  H.  Imlay,  Peter  D. 
Vroom  and  William  Cox,  who  received  an  average  majority  of  300 
votes  over  their  competitors,  John  Condit,  William  Helms,  Henry 
Southard,  Ebenezer  Elmer  and  James  Mott.  The  earliest  town  meeting 
recorded  occurred  on  the  second  Monday  in  April,  1801,  when  the  fol- 
lowing principal  officers  were  chosen:  Abraham  Schuyler,  president; 
Jacob  Dunham,  town  clerk;  Elijah  Phillips,  assessor;  Wm.  Tenbrook, 
collector  and  overseer  of  the  poor ;  Abraham  Schuyler,  James  Schure- 
man,  James  Bennit,  Abraham  Blauvelt  and  William*  Lawson,  town  com- 
mittee; John  Neilson  and  Benjamin  Taylor,  chosen  freeholders.  The 
first  formal  provision  for  the  poor  was  made  in  1802,  when  it  was 
ordered  that  $200  be  raised  "for  the  use  of  the  poor,"  and  that  a  house 
be  rented  and  the  poor  of  the  township  be  maintained  in  said  house 
and  employed  in  such  useful  labor  as  might  be  deemed  advantageous. 
In  1817  a  farm  of  139  acres  on  George's  road  was  purchased  from  Jacob 
Klady  for  $6,992,  a  building  erected,  fences  and  other  improvements 
made  on  "the  poprhouse  farm,"  and  provision  made  for  the  employ- 
ment of  a  suitable  superintendent  for  the  institution.  In  the  settlement 
of  the  accounts  between  North  and  East  Brunswick  townships  and 
the  city  of  New  Brunswick,  after  the  division  of  North  Brunswick 
in  i860,  the  poor-house  farm,  which  had  been  established  and  main- 
tained at  the  expense  of  the  taxpayers  of  the  whole  township  of  North 
Brunswick,  as  previously  bounded,  were  allotted  to  New  Brunswick, 
and  have  since  been  managed  at  the  expense  and  for  the  benefit  of 
that  city. 

The  early  schoolhouses  were  built  by  subscription,  and  the  teachers 
paid  by  those  who  were  able  to  do  so.  The  first  reference  in  the  town- 
ship records  relative  to  the  provision  for  the  education  of  those  who 
were  unable  to  pay  for  the  same  was  made  in  1827,  when  it  was  ordered 
that  $500  be  raised  for  the  education  of  the  poor  children  of  the  town- 
ship. In  1829  the  first  school  committee  was  elected,  consisting  of 
Staats  Van  Deursen,  Lewis  D.  Hardenbergh,  Peter  Dayton,  James  Gable 
and  Isaac  Brower.  The  only  time  the  names  of  school  trustees  appear 
in  the  minutes  was  in  1843,  when  the  following  were  serving :  Peter  P. 


NORTH  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP  425 

Runyon,  George  G.  Nevius,  J.  Whitnach,  John  Christopher,  Richard 
De  Mott,  J.  H.  Outcalt,  H.  Cock,  Benjamin  L.  Smith,  H.  H.  Booraem, 
J.  Vandeventer,  Peter  L.  Buckalew,  Matthew  Gilliland,  J.  Combs,  Abra- 
ham Rappleyea,  R.  D.  Applegate,  F.  Stults,  Stephen  Smith,  J.  L.  Pierson 
and  Cornelius  W.  Tunison.  School  committeemen  were  not  elected 
until  after  1846.  In  1847,  Dr.  Henry  B.  Poal  was  appointed  the  first 
township  superintendent  of  schools.  The  "free  school"  system  was 
adopted  in  185 1.  There  are  two  schools  in  the  township;  at  Red  Lion, 
Miss  Alice  D.  Cox,  teacher ;  and  at  Livingston  Park,  Miss  Mamie  Tracey, 
teacher.    Miss  Bessie  M.  Schoenly  is  the  supervising  principal. 

A  grist  mill  was  built  at  a  very  early  day  where  Milltown  is  now 
situated,  on  the  North  Brunswick  side  of  Lawrence  brook,  and  about 
three-quarters  of  a  mile  from  the  borough.  Early  in  1800  it  was  owned 
by  Jacob  I.  Bergen,  and  the  place  was  known  as  Bergen's  Mills.  The 
water  power  was  first  utilized  as  early  as  1750  to  operate  a  saw  mill 
and  grist  mill,  which  stood  within  the  area  afterward  occupied  by 
Parson's  Brookford  Snuff  Mills.  A  fulling  mill  was  also  erected,  and 
when  the  domestic  carding  of  wool  ceased  the  building  was  converted 
into  a  snuff  mill  and  as  such  was  operated  by  Matthew  Edgerton  from 
1839  to  1856.  In  1851  the  whole  plant  was  destroyed  by  fire  and  the 
old  saw  mill  and  grist  mill  forever  disappeared.  The  snuflf  mill  was 
rebuilt  in  1852  and  the  manufacture  of  snufif  continued  by  Mr.  Edgerton 
until  1856,  when  he  sold  the  mill  to  William  G.  Parsons,  who  enlarged 
and  improved  the  property  from  time  to  time,  and  manufactured  a  num- 
ber of  varieties  of  snuff,  mainly  Scotch,  Maccaboy,  Lundy  Foot  and 
French  rappee.  After  Mr.  Parson's  death,  his  son,  James  M.,  continued 
the  business,  until  he,  too,  passed  away. 

During  the  latter  part  of  1700  a  tannery  was  operated  near  what 
was  known  as  Voorhees  Station,  on  the  branch  railway  to  Millstone. 
It  afterward  became  the  property  of  J.  V.  D.  Christopher,  and  contained 
twenty-eight  vats,  where  harness,  shoe  and  upper  leather  were  manu- 
factured. Nursery  stock  is  propagated  to  a  considerable  extent,  and 
a  number  of  wheelwright,  blacksmith  and  mechanics  shops  are  to  be 
found  in  various  localities.  The  farms  are  in  a  thrifty  condition,  the 
roads  well  kept  and  the  houses  of  a  substantial  character. 

The  George's  Road  Baptist  Church  was  the  first  religious  edifice  in 
this  locality.  Before  any  church  organization  was  formed,  Rev.  John 
B.  Case  labored  there  as  a  missionary.  Revs.  G.  S.  Webb,  Randolph 
Martin  and  Robert  Lyle  frequently  preached,  and  those  who  were  bap- 
tized were  received  into  that  church.  At  a  meeting  held  at  the  house 
of  John  Bennett,  January  30,  1843,  articles  of  faith,  a  church  covenant 
and  the  name  of  the  church,  were  agreed  upon,  which,  three  days  later, 
were  recognized  by  a  council  from  the  following  churches:  First  New 
Brunswick,  Independent  Bethel,  at  Washington  (South  River),  Hights-

town,  Penn's  Neck,  Nottingham  Square,  Piscataway,  and  Jacksonville, 
South  Amboy.  Thirty-three  members  were  enrolled,  the  following 
families  being  represented:  Messeroll,  De  Hart,  Provost,  Suydam, 
Buckelew,  Creamer,  Drake,  Thompson,  Bound,  Sperling,  Bennett  and 
Hendricks.  The  first  church  was  dedicated  March  17,  1847,  the  pastor 
being  Rev.  David  P.  Perdun,  who  succeeded  Rev.  Mr.  Case,  resigned. 
Subsequent  pastors  were  Revs.  B.  Stelle,  Morgan  Cox,  Charles  Cordo, 
Christian  Brinckerhoff  and  Louis  Silleck. 

The  earliest  interments  were  made  in  the  old  graveyard  now  in- 
cluded in  Van  Liew  cemetery,  and  in  the  ancient  burying  ground  at 
Three-Mile  run.  The  earliest  legible  inscription  in  the  old  portion  of 
Van  Liew  cemetery  is  in  Holland  Dutch  and  reads  as  follows :  "Johannes 
Martinus  Van  Harlingen  was  born  January  ri,  1684,  at  West  Brook  in 
Holland,  and  died  October  23,  1728,  at  Lawrence  Brook."  The  Van 
Liew  Cemetery  Association  was  incorporated  in  1861,  with  Dennis 
Vanderbilt,  Henry  H.  Booraem,  Philip  Kuhlthau,  Ross  Drake  and  Peter 
Stevenson  as  officers.  It  contains  about  five  acres,  and  in  it  are  buried 
many  members  of  the  Van  Liew,  Van  Harlingen,  Voorhees,  Bodine, 
Buckelew,  Vanderbilt,  Meseroll  and  other  old  families  of  the  township. 
Elmwood  is  the  largest  and  most  beautiful  cemetery  in  this  locality, 
containing  about  forty  acres,  and  situated  in  the  northern  border  of  the 
township,  not  far  from  the  other  cemetery.  It  is  the  property  of  an 
association  and  nominally  succeeded  the  Cedar  Lawn  Association,  incor- 
porated in  1868,  with  Dr.  Henry  R.  Baldwin,  Dr.  A.  D.  Newell,  Henry  L. 
Janeway,  Johnson  Letson,  Levi  D.  Jarrard,  Simon  Van  Wickle,  Lucius 
P.  Porter  and  others  as  stockholders. 

The  Red  Lion  Tavern  on  George's  road,  and  about  in  the  centre  of 
the  township,  was  built  more  than  a  century  and  a  half  ago,  and  was 
the  scene  of  many  public  meetings  and  celebrations.  The  Black  Horse 
Inn,  also  on  George's  road  and  near  the  southeastern  boundary  of  the 
township,  was  about  1800  a  well-known  hostelry.  Bodine's  Corners  is 
a  neighborhood,  in  the  northern  part  of  the  township,  and  named  from 
pioneers  who  settled  there.  Three-Mile  run  designates  a  hamlet  near 
Franklin  township,  Somerset  county,  and  owes  its  name  to  a  stream  at 
that  place.  Six-Mile  Run  is  another  neighborhood,  on  the  county  line 
farther  south. 

The  following  are  the  principal  township  oificials:  E.  Irving  Mes- 
eroll, assessor;  Isaac  V.  Williamson,  collector  and  treasurer;  Alfred 
Yorston,  chairman;  Frank  G.  Hart  and  Isaiah  Vandewater,  town  com- 
mittee; Louis  E.  Phillips,  clerk;  Edward  W.  Suydam,  James  H.  and 
Thomas  W.  Buckelew,  James  Pulda,  Alfred  Yorston,  Isaiah  Vande- 
water, Peter  R.  Van  Sickle,  Prof.  Henry  Miller,  and  Isaac  V.  William- 
son, custodian.  Board  of  Education ;  Irving  Hoagland,  counsel ;  and  Dr. 
Ferd.  E.  Riva,  physician. 


EAST  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP  427 

East  Brunswick  Township — This  township  was  created  in  i860,  from 
a  portion  of  North  Brunswick  and  Monroe  townships,  and  is  situated 
nearly  in  the  centre  of  the  county.  The  boundaries  are:  On  the  north 
by  New  Brunswick  and  the  Raritan  river;  on  the  east  by  South  river 
and  the  borough  of  South  River;  on  the  southeast  by  South  river  and 
the  boroughs  of  Spotswood  and  Helmetta ;  on  the  south  by  Monroe  and 
South  Brunswick  townships;  and  on  west  and  northwest  by  South 
Brunswick  township  and  Lawrence  Brook.  The  township,  as  may  be 
seen,  is  very  irregular  in  form,  and  has,  including  the  boroughs  of 
South  River  and  Spotswood,  13,130  acres.  At  the  present  writing  the 
village  of  Old  Bridge  has  applied  to  the  Legislature  for  a  borough 
charter. 

In  1720,  Hartshorne  Willett,  grandson  of  Sir  Thomas  Willett,  baro- 
.  net,  of  England,  settled  on  the  west  bank  of  South  river,  directly  in  front 
of  where  the  borough  of  South  River  is  located,  and  the  place  was 
known  as  Willettstown  until  about  1784,  when  Abraham  Barkelew,  a 
pioneer  and  great  admirer  of  General  Washington,  renamed  the  settle- 
ment in  his  honor.  The  postoffice  was  first  established  under  the  name  of 
Washington,  and  was  so  called  until  it  became  necessary  to  change  the 
name  on  account  of  a  postoffice  of  the  same  title  in  Warren  county, 
and  then  the  present  name  of  South  River  was  adopted  by  authority  of 
the  Postoffice  Department.  In  the  list  of  those  who  first  came  to  the 
settlement  appear  the  names  of  Messier,  Obert,  Norman,  Kleine,  Vree- 
land.  Van  Dcventer,  Serviss,  Ackerman,  Booraem,  Ogden,  Letts,  Tuni- 
son,  Van  Arsdalen,  Combs,  Bissett,  Martin,  Conover,  Whitehead,  Dun- 
ham and  Hardenbrook;  also  Peterson,  Stults,  Gordon,  Hager,  Ricketts, 
King,  Walker,  Manahan,  De  Voe^  Frazer,  Sheppard,  Price  and  many 
others.  Shortly  before  the  Revolutionary  War,  John  Bissett  and  James 
and  Leonard  Appleby,  of  Monmouth  county,  located  in  the  little  colony. 
John  Crommelin  lived  on  the  creek  that  bears  his  name. 

In  1800  Washington  did  not  contain  more  than  six  houses.  Reden 
Wood  and  Elias  Doughty  had  a  store  and  dock  during  the  War  of 
1812,  and  carried  government  goods  to  New  York,  via  South  river. 
Owing  to  the  embargo  at  that  time,  quantities  of  goods  were  brought 
overland  to  the  village,  and  carried  thence  to  New  York  by  water  In 
1823  Vincent  Barkelew  opened  a  store  on  Main  street,  near  the  river. 
In  the  same  year  Samuel  Gorden,  of  South  Amboy,  a  prominent  boat- 
man, located  in  the  town  and  constructed  a  canal,  authorized  by  the 
Legislature,  from  South  river  to  the  Raritan,  to  improve  the  navigation 
to  New  York.  He  also  opened  a  road  from  the  town  to  Cranbury 
village.  His  son  Samuel  built  the  first  brick  house  in  the  town  in  1825. 
About  this  time  the  postoffice  was  established  by  Frederick  A.  Kleine 
in  a  small  building  near  the  place  where  Theodore  Willett's  brick  yard 
was  afterward  located.     From   1825  to  1855  the  peach  trade  was  an 


428  MIDDLESEX 

important  industry,  and  it  was  not  unusual  to  see  six  or  more  sloops 
and  schooners  leaving  daily  for  New  York,  laden  with  the  fruit.  Later 
on  steamboats  were  used  for  transportation,  until  the  trade  began  to 
decline  owing  to  failing  crops.  Jonathan  Booraem  began  building 
sloops  and  schooners  in  1824  for  river  navigation,  and  later  on,  large 
coasting  vessels.  The  yard  continued  in  operation,  conducted  by  his 
descendants  for  over  fifty  years.  These  industries  caused  an  increase 
in  population,  and  in  1834  the  town  had  forty  dwellings,  three  stores, 
six  docks  and  two  taverns.  Before  the  railways  came,  the  village 
occupied  an  excellent  position  on  the  most  direct  route  from  New  York 
to  Philadelphia.  In  1823  a  steamboat  route  was  established  between 
New  York  and  the  village,  whence  a  regular  line  of  stages,  with  facilities 
for  freight,  conveyed  passengers  to  the  Delaware  river,  at  Bordentown. 
This  line  was  superseded  by  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  railroad,  then  com- 
pleted as  far  as  Hightstown,  about  1830. 

The  Old  School  Baptist  Church  of  Washington  (on  Main  street. 
South  River  borough),  is  the  oldest  place  of  worship  in  the  township, 
the  deed  conveying  the  ground  upon  which  it  stands  being  dated  1805, 
and  it  is  believed  that  the  church  was  erected  previous  to  that  year. 
It  is  a  plain  frame  building,  the  porch  supported  by  square  pillars,  and 
with  no  attempt  at  exterior  ornamentation.  The  list  of  "constituent 
members"  in  the  record  book  of  1805  contains  the  following  names: 
Samuel,  Martha  and  Sarah  Willett ;  Abraham,  Stephen,  Ruth  and  Sarah 
Barkelew;  Peter  and  Mary  Obert;  Jacob  and  John  Stults;  Catharine 
and  Sarah  Dunham ;  Joseph  and  Phebe  Cheeseman ;  Ephraim  and  Sarah 
Roff;  Anthony  and  Linda  Collins;  James  Hommann,  Martha  Mager, 
Martha  Hooper,  Charles  Gilmore,  Mary  Van  Sykle,  L.  M.  Bowman, 
Catharine  Craven,  Mary  Cotrall,  Martha  Davis,  Anna  Johnson,  Samuel 
Pitney,  Catharine  Prooste,  Linda  Brown,  Rebecca  Owens,  Ann  Dean, 
Francis  Letts,  Jennie  Van  Cart,  Rebecca  James,  and  "Oliver,  a  man  of 
color."  As  usual  in  such  cases,  the  women  are  in  the  majority.  Rev. 
Peter  Wilson  was  the  first  pastor.  Rev.  James  C.  Goble  ministered  in 
1824,  1839  and  185 1.  "Elder"  Wilson  Housel  served  for  over  thirty 
years,  and  is  well  remembered  by  many  at  the  present  time.  Rev.  John 
M.  Fenton,  of  Philadelphia,  preaches  there  monthly ;  but  there  has  been 
no  settled  pastor  for  many  years. 

By  an  Act  of  the  Legislature  approved  February  28,  i860,  all  those 
parts  of  the  townships  of  North  Brunswick  and  Monroe  hereinafter 
described  are  hereby  set  off  and  established  as  East  Brunswick  town- 
ship, viz: 

Beginning  at  the  mouth  of  Lawrence  brook,  where  it  falls  into  the 
Raritan  river;  thence  southwesterly  up  the  said  Lawrence  brook  to 
where  Ireland's  brook  falls  into  the  said  Lawrence  brook  and  the  line 
of  South  Brunswick  township;  thence  southeasterly  up  said  Ireland's 
brook  and  line  of  South  Brunswick  to  the  line  of  Monroe  township; 


EAST  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP  429 

thence  southwesterly  along  the  township  line  of  South  Brunswick  and 
Monroe  to  the  line  known  as  Bass'  patent  line;  thence  southerly  and 
easterly  along  said  Bass'  patent  to  Manalapan  river ;  thence  northeasterly 
down  said  river  to  the  mouth  of  the  stream  that  drains  the  Burnt  Mead- 
ows; thence  up  the  stream  aforesaid  to  Slab  Bridge;  thence  a  due  east 
course  to  Matchaponix  river,  and  the  line  of  South  Amboy ;  thence  north- 
erly down  Matchaponix  and  South  rivers  to  the  mouth  of  latter  at 
Raritan  river;  and  thence  northwesterly  up  Raritan  river  to  the  mouth 
of  Lawrence  brook,  the  place  of  beginning. 

The  first  town  meeting  was  held  April  9,  i860,  at  the  hotel  of  Mrs. 
Van  Cleef,  in  Spotswood  village,  with  Stephen  Martin  as  moderator, 
and  Henry  Gordon,  clerk.    The  following  township  officers  were  elected : 

B.  Frank  Lloyd,  judge  of  election;  Stephen  Smith,  assessor;  S.  H. 
Barkelew,  collector ;  Henry  Gordon,  clerk ;  Andrew  Snowhill  and  James 

C.  Stout,  chosen  freeholders;  A.  Vandeventer,  school  superintendent; 
Leonard  Appleby,  R.  S.  Herbert,  Garret  I.  Snedeker,  Furman  Smith 
and  John  Griggs,  township  committee;  Richard  Serviss,  overseer  of 
poor ;  Lewis  W.  Spencer  and  Jere.  Rappelyea,  surveyors  of  highways ; 
James  Appleby,  James  Bissett  and  George  Lane,  commissioners  of 
appeal.  Among  former  chosen  freeholders  have  been  General  L.  L.  F. 
Appleby,  J.  Biddle  Herbert,  Daniel  B.  Martin,  James  Bissett  (director 
for  many  years),  Charles  P.  and  Isaac  N.  Blew  and  Abial  Price. 

The  first  tavern  in  the  township  is  supposed  to  have  occupied  the 
site  where  Samuel  Gordon,  Jr.,  built  his  brick  house  in  the  village  of 
Washington,  allusion  to  which  has  heretofore  been  made,  and  was 
kept  for  many  years  by  Peter  Obert.  The  next  inn  was  the  East  Bruns- 
wick House,  on  Main  street,  and  conducted  for  many  years  by  the  late 
Benjamin  B.  Walker.  Abraham  Barkelew  and  Joseph  Gulick  built  the 
Washington  Hotel,  also  on  Main  street,  and  it  was  for  a  long  time 
under  the  management  of  the  genial  J.  Cyrus  Voorhees.  Capt.  Samuel 
Martin  was  the  landlord  in  1823.  He  was  a  noted  pilot  and  took  several 
steamers  to  California  through  Magellan's  Straits. 

Samuel  Whitehead,  a  native  of  England,  came  to  this  county  about 
1820,  purchased  a  large  tract  of  land  about  four  miles  from  Washington, 
engaged  in  peach  culture,  and  accumulated  a  fortune.  Retiring  from 
that  business  about  1850,  he  commenced  the  mining  and  selling  of 
fire  clays,  fire  and  moulding  sands  and  kaolin,  which  has  ever  since 
been  one  of  the  most  important  industries  in  this  locality.  He  found 
upon  the  lands  of  this,  and  adjoining  townships,  adjacent  to  river  navi- 
gation, the  above  mentioned  materials,  which  in  a  few  years  became 
the  only  source  of  supply  of  those  articles  to  New  York  and  other  cities. 
The  business  is  most  successfully  carried  on  by  the  third  generation  of 
the  family.  Whitehead,  Jacob  Eaton  and  Samuel  Stout  were  actively 
engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  white  and  stoneware  between  1840-1860. 
Other  miners  and  manufacturers  of  clay  have  been  James  Bissett,  Wil- 


430  MIDDLESEX 

lett  &amp;  Yates,  and  Pettit  &amp;  Miller,  the  last  named  being  the  ultimate 
successors  to  John  Griggs,  who  established  the  first  yard.  At  Old 
Bridge,  between  1835-1840,  Leonard  Appleby,  James  C.  Stout  and  a  Van 
Wickle  manufactured  fanning  mills;  and  Stout  also  was  engaged  in 
distilling  apple  brandy  and  whiskey  until  1878.  John  Dill  operated  a 
snuff  mill  about  i860,  and  his  son  William  conducted  the  business  until 

1875- 

The  Washington  Monumental  Cemetery,  established  December  6, 

1856,  is  located  on  an  elevation  just  outside  South  River  borough.     It 

is  well  shaded  by  cedar  trees  and  kept  in  excellent  order.    In  the  centre 

stands  a  monument  about  twenty-five  feet  high,  on  which  are  cut  the 

names  of  the  contributors  to  its  erection  in  1857.     The  Chestnut  Hill 

Cemetery  is  situated  on  land  purchased  from  James  Bissett  in   1861, 

northwest  from  and  overlooking  Old  Bridge  village. 

On  February  28,  1870,  the  Legislature  passed  an  act  providing  that 
the  town  of  Washington  should  be  governed  by  a  board  of  commission- 
ers, elected  annually,  and  defining  the  limits  of  the  town  as  follows: 
"Beginning  at  South  river,  in  a  line  of  lands  between  Randolph  Low 
and  John  Culver,  and  running  thence,  first,  up  said  line,  and  on  the  same 
course,  to  the  centre  of  the  road  leading  from  Old  Bridge  to  New 
Brunswick,  near  (former)  Sheriff  Bissett's  house;  second,  following 
the  centre  of  said  road,  the  different  courses  thereof,  to  a  line  of  lands 
between  Charles  Vandeventer's  and  Messrs.  Messler's;  third,  down  the 
said  line,  and  a  line  of  Garline  and  Abraham  Vandeventer  to  South 
River  aforesaid;  and  fourth,  up  said  river,  the  courses  thereof,  to  the 
place  of  beginning."  Among  the  commissioners  have  been  Garret  I. 
Snedeker,  James  Bissett,  Charles  Whitehead,  W.  C.  Barkelew,  Daniel 
Morgan,  Fred  Stults,  George  E.  Brown,  Thomas  Booraem,  Jonathan 
H.  Peterson,  Isaac  N.  Blew  and  Charles  SerViss. 

Captain  Thomas  McDowell,  who  succeeded  the  firm  of  Gulick  &amp; 
McDowell,  merchants,  of  Washington  village,  had  an  active  and  pic- 
turesque career.  In  1836  he  built  a  sloop  for  the  river  trade,  in  1838 
a  vessel  for  the  coasting  trade,  and  in  1848  a  steamer  for  the  Southern 
trade.  In  1849  he  became  a  pioneer  merchant  and  business  man,  and 
an  official  at  Sacramento  City,  California,  and  is  said  to  have  been  mayor 
of  that  city.  He  revisited  California  in  1852  and  1858,  was  in  business  in 
Melbourne,  Australia,  in  1853-55,  and  was  United  States  consul  at  the 
Cape  of  Good  Hope,  1862-1864.  He  was  fine  looking,  a  good  talker,  and 
possessed  of  considerable  ability. 

It  is  almost  impossible  to  get  a  correct  list  of  the  Revolutionary 
soldiers  from  this  vicinity;  but,  after  consulting  the  paper  written  by 
the  late  Dr.  Charles  D.  Deshler,  of  New  Brunswick,  in  1882,  and  other 
authorities,  we  are  inclined  to  believe  that  the  following  were  from  this 
part  of  the  county :  Captain  Thomas  Combs,  Lieut.  Andrew  McDowell. 


EAST  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP  431 

Sergeants  Simon  Messier  and  James  Griggs;  Andrew  Bissett,  James 
Chambers,  Jonathan,  Samuel,  Stephen  and  William  Combs,  William 
Davison,  Peter  Obert,  Benjamin  Ogden,  Frederick  Outgelt,  Isaac 
Snediker,  Peter  Stults,  Samuel  and  Hartshorn  Willett  and  Samuel 
Whitehead. 

Old  Bridge  is  a  thriving  village  of  about  2,000  population,  located 
at  the  head  of  navigation  on  South  river  and  is  on  the  former  Camden 
&amp;  Amboy  railroad,  about  nine  miles  from  Perth  Amboy.  It  derives 
its  name  from  the  fact  that  the  first  bridge  over  the  South  river  was 
built  there,  and  as  other  bridges  were  placed  across  the  stream,  the 
first  one  became  the  "Old  Bridge."  It  early  became  a  point  from  which 
large  quantities  of  produce,  wood,  and  other  merchandise,  some  of 
which  was  brought  from  miles  beyond  the  limits  of  the  county,  were 
shipped,  by  way  of  South  river,  to  New  York.  Soon  after  the  close  of 
the  Revolutionary  War,  Gen.  James  Morgan  and  Jacob  Van  Wickle 
operated  a  pottery  until  1828,  and  a  second  venture  of  a  similar  char- 
acter was  started  by  one  of  the  Bissetts  about  1815  and  continued  until 
1830.  General  Obadiah  Herbert  settled  in  the  village  in  1810,  becoming 
a  large  property  owner.  He  opened  a  store,  built  a  dock  and  ware- 
houses, and  engaged  largely  in  shipping  wood  and  other  merchantable 
property  to  New  York.  He  had  several  vessels  for  the  trade  built 
in  the  village,  and  a  ship  yard  was  operated  there  for  several  years. 
A  distillery  established  by  James  C.  Stout  in  1835,  Van  Wickle's  fanning 
mill  factory  from  1835-1840,  and  that  of  Stout  &amp;  Appleby  from  1840- 
1850,  and  the  snuff  mill  operated  successively  by  John  and  William  Dill, 
1860-75,  were  prominent  enterprises  of  the  past.  A  sawmill,  clothing 
factory,  and  a  blacksmith  and  wheelwright  shop  were  also  in  operation. 

There  are  two  churches,  the  Simpson  Methodist  Episcopal  and  the 
Independent  Bethel  Baptist.  The  public  school  is  a  handsome  brick 
building,  and  is  attended  by  about  125  scholars.  Many  of  the  older 
pupils  attend  high  schools  in  New  Brunswick  and  Jamesburg.  Judge 
Andrew  J.  Disbrow,  once  sheriff,  was  postmaster  for  over  forty-five 
years.    There  are  two  hotels  and  an  excellent  store. 

The  following  are  the  principal  officials  of  East  Brunswick  township : 
Russell  B.  Herbert,  assessor;  George  D.  Rue,  collector  and  treasurer; 
William  L.  Green,  Alexander  S.  Conover  and  Henry  Warnsdorfer,  town- 
ship committee ;  and  Asher  B.  Rue,  clerk. 

South  Brunswick  Township — The  township  is  situated  in  the  extreme 
southwestern  part  of  the  county,  and  bounded  as  follows:  North  by 
North  and  East  Brunswick  townships ;  east  by  East  Brunswick,  Monroe 
and  Cranbury  townships;  south  by  Cranbury  township  and  Mercer 
county;  and  west  by  Somerset  county.  Its  greatest  length  north  and 
south  was  slightly  more  than  eight  miles,  and  from  its  extreme  eastern 
to  its  extreme  western  part  it  measured  eleven  miles.    The  most  exten- 


432  MIDDLESEX 

sive  township  of  the  county  at  the  time"  of  its  organization,  and  one  of 
the  earliest  formed,  it  has  long  been  historically  one  of  the  most  inter- 
esting of  those  south  of  the  Raritan.  Its  area  was  considerably  reduced 
in  1872  by  the  formation  from  its  territory  of  a  portion  of  Cranbury 
township. 

The  township  was  organized  about  1685.  In  1841  the  Legislature 
authorized  the  township  to  vote  by  ballot  at  town  meetings.  Previous 
to  that,  the  voters  appointed  a  moderator,  who  conducted  the  elections 
by  standing  a  candidate  for  office  in  a  conspicuous  place,  and  directing 
that  such  voters  as  were  in  favor  of  his  election  should  place  themselves 
on  a  given  side  of  the  road,  and  those  opposed  upon  the  opposite  side. 
The  count  of  votes  was  made  by  the  moderator  and  the  result  declared. 

The  nearness  of  the  township  to  Princeton  and  Trenton  caused  it 
to  be  early  occupied,  and  the  passage  through  it  of  the  Trenton  turn- 
pike, and  the  more  winding  George's  road,  known  later  as  the  New 
Brunswick  and  Cranbury  turnpike,  have  rendered  it  long  familiar  to 
travelers  from  New  Brunswick  southward.  The  old  Friendship  and 
Ridge  roads  were  much  traveled  thoroughfares  in  the  southern  part, 
and  the  "great  ditch,"  as  it  was  called,  in  the  northeastern  part,  is  evi- 
dence of  the  time  and  money  expended  in  the  drainage  of  Pigeon  Swamp, 
an  extensive  tract  of  marshland,  long  unreclaimed.  The  "Indian  Fields," 
near  the  southeastern  extremity,  mark  the  location  of  an  encampment 
when  settlement  began. 

The  land  is  drained  by  Lawrence  brook,  which  rises  in  the  northern 
part  of  the  township;  by  Devil's  brook,  in  the  southwestern;  and  by 
Heathcote's  brook  in  the  western  part,  the  two  last-named  emptying 
into  Millstone  river,  which  flows  for  a  considerable  distance  along  the 
southern  and  western  boundary  of  the  township.  The  soil  is  fair 
tillable  land  and,  like  the  greater  part  of  the  county  south  of  the 
Raritan,  abounds  in  gravel  and  contains  much  sandy  and  clayey  loam. 
The  New  York  division  of  the  Pennsylvania  railroad  traverses  the 
township  north  and  south,  and  at  Monmouth  Junction  unites  with  the 
Rocky  Hill  railroad  and  western  extension  of  the  Freehold  &amp;  James- 
burg  railroad.  The  Delaware  and  Raritan  canal  has  its  course  in  a 
northerly  and  southerly  direction  across  the  township's  western  part, 
parallel  with  the  Millstone  river,  which  it  crosses  by  an  acqueduct  near 
Gray's  Mills. 

Along  the  stage  routes,  taverns  were  established  at  an  early  date 
at  Rhode  Hall,  Dayton  and  Kingston,  and  about  these  inns  settlements 
gradually  formed  until  the  locality  became  generally  populated.  The 
pioneer  landlord  at  Rhode  Hall  was  David  Williamson,  from  Scotland, 
who  be.stowed  upon  the  little  settlement  the  name  by  which  it  has 
since  been  known.  He  came  about  1730,  purchased  a  large  tract  of 
land,  and  gathered  about  him  a  number  of  families,  the  majority  of 


SOUTH  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP  433 

which  were  Scotch  by  birth,  or  descent.  Thomas  McDowell  located 
there  in  1774,  purchased  Williamson's  estate  and  engaged  in  farming 
and  innkeeping.  The  Terhune  family  lived  at  Dayton,  it  is  believed,  as 
early  as  1700,  and  there  is  a  record  of  the  birth  of  Garret  Terhune,  at 
South  Brunswick,  in  1737.  Simmons  and  John  Pierson,  farmers,  set- 
tled in  the  neighborhood  about  1760.  About  1774,  Farrington  Barkelew 
became  an  extensive  landowner.  John  Probasco,  carpenter,  came  about 
1775.  The  Van  Dyke  family  located  here  before  the  Revolution,  and 
left  many  descendants.  Reuben  Van  Pelt  and  Benjamin  Petty,  farmers, 
located  here  between  1775  and  1780.  William  and  John  Rue,  farmers, 
were  early  settlers,  the  latter  living  in  the  township  during  the  Revo- 
lution. 

As  early  as  1700,  Jediah  Higgins  purchased  1,000  acres  near  Kingston, 
from  the  Indians,  the  price  being  "a  sow  and  a  litter  of  pigs."  This 
will  doubtless  seem  strange  to  many,  who  do  npt  know  of  the  love  of 
the  redmen  for  fresh  pork.  The  Claytons  have  been  and  still  are  an 
influential  family  in  the  township.  It  is  thought  the  first  of  the  name 
was  John,  who  located  here  soon  after  the  Revolution.  Samuel  Combs 
settled  at  Fresh  Ponds  about  1780,  bought  much  larid  and  established 
the  first  distillery  in  the  township.  Isaac  and  Daniel  Slover,  Hollanders, 
came  about  1785.  In  a  list  of  residents  of  the  township  who  claimed 
to  have  sustained  loss  or  damage  to  property  during  the  Revolution 
appear  the  names  of  Armstrong,  Bayles,  Britton,  Cruser,  De  Witt, 
Griggs,  Groendyke,  Longstreet,  Skillman,  Stothoff,  Van  Tine,  Wagner 
and  Wetherell.  The  settlement  at  Kingston,  which  is  partly  in  South 
Brunswick,  Somerset  and  Mercer  counties,  began  at  a  very  early  date. 
Van  Tilburgh  and  Withington  were  the  pioneer  landlords,  the  former's 
house  being  honored  by  frequent  visits  from  Gen.  Washington  and  the 
early  Governors  of  the  Province.  Withington's  was  a  great  stage  depot 
and  one  of  the  most  famous  hostelries  in  East  Jersey. 

It  was  at  Kingston  that  Washington's  army  eluded  the  British  on 
the  day  of  the  battle  of  Princeton,  by  filing  off  to  the  left  at  the  church, 
down  a  narrow  road  leading  to  Rocky  Hill,  while  the  enemy,  supposing 
he  had  gone  to  New  Brunswick  to  destroy  their  winter  stores,  kept  on 
the  main  road. 

Dayton,  a  village  southeast  of  the  center  of  the  township,  and  on 
the  line  of  the  New  York  division  of  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  was 
named  in  honor  of  William  L.  Dayton,  of  Trenton.  On  October  16,  1869, 
a  Presbyterian  church  with  fifty-eight  members,  principally  from  the 
First  and  Second  Churches  of  Cranbury,  was  organized.  The  church 
was  dedicated  in  1870,  the  first  pastor  being  Rev.  J.  W.  Hubbard.  The 
Baptist  church  was  erected  in  1848,  and  the  first  service  was  conducted 
by  Rev.  Jacob  Gessner.  No  records  of  the  church  are  known  to  exist, 
but  a  legal  organization  is  maintained.    A  church  was  built  at  Monmouth 

Mid-28 


434  MIDDLESEX 

Junction  in  1879,  and  was  devoted  to  use  of  all  Christian  denominations. 
An  old  frame  church  was  built  many  years  ago,  and  served  as  a  mis- 
sion church  under  the  auspices  of  the  Methodist  Protestant  denomina- 
tion. 

It  is  very  probable  that  the  first  school  house  built  was  near  Kingston. 
It  is  known  that  a  church  existed  there  in  1723  and  that  shortly  after  a 
school  was  connected  with  it.  The  first  school  house  of  which  any 
information  has  been  obtained  was  built  in  1776.  In  1831  another  was 
erected  in  the  southern  portion  of  the  township.  There  were  early 
schools  at  Dayton  (once  called  Cross  Roads),  and  Rhode  Hall.  The 
present  public  schools  are  located  at  the  following  points:  Sand  Hills, 
Deans,  Fresh  Ponds,  Ridge,  Dayton,  Rhode  Hall,  Pleasant  Hill,  King- 
ston and  Monmouth  Junction. 

Gray's  Mill,  Gray's  grist  mill,  on  the  Millstone  river,  in  the  south- 
western part  of  the  township,  is  the  successor  of  a  mill  which  stood 
there  many  years  before  the  Revolution  and  was  first  known  as  the 
Aqueduct  Mill,  the  earliest  proprietor  being  one  Cooley.  During  the 
Revolution  it  was  burned,  rebuilt  and  finally  became  the  property  of 
Alexander  Gray,  from  whom  the  locality  gained  its  present  name. 
About  1810  Abraham  built  a  sawmill  at  what  is  now  known  as  Deans 
Station,  on  the  Pennsylvania  railroad.  Aaron,  Abraham's  son,  built  a 
grist  mill  adjacent  to  the  sawmill.  In  1845  John  H.  Martin  built  several 
houses  and  opened  a  store  there,  and  from  that  time  until  after  the  rail- 
road station  was  established  the  hamlet  was  known  as  Martinsville.  In 
1852  Mr.  Martin  and  J.  C.  Powers  operated  distilleries  at  and  near  Deans. 
Hay  presses  were  established  at  Deans  and  Dayton  in  1873  and  1875. 
North  of  Mapleton,  on  the  Millstone  river  are  quarries  of  gray  freestone, 
which  were  used  in  the  construction  of  locks  on  the  Delaware  and 
Raritan  canal. 

The  first  public  house  in  Dayton  was  kept  by  James  Whitlock  in 
1750.  Thomas  Wetherel  built  and  conducted  an  inn  there  until  about 
1818.  Abraham  Terhune  erected  the  Exchange  Hotel  in  i860.  The 
first  store  was  kept  by  Mrs.  Abigail  Van  Pelt,  who  retailed  all  kinds  of 
dry,  and  a  considerable  amount  of  "wet  goods."  Thomas  W.  Schenck 
conducted  a  remunerative  store  for  about  thirty  years.  Andrew  Ely, 
a  prominent  citizen  and  formerly  a  chosen  freeholder,  has  conducted  an 
excellent  general  store  for  many  years. 

Fresh  Ponds,  a  hamlet,  is  located  at  a  cross  roads  in  the  northeastern 
part  of  the  township.  It  was  so-called  because  of  its  proximity  to  several 
marshy  ponds,  known  collectively  as  Pigeon  Swamp,  some  years  ago 
partially  drained  by  the  improvement  heretofore  alluded  to  as  "the 
great  ditch." 

Mapleton,  taking  its  name  from  a  family  formerly  located  there,  is 
a  hamlet  on  the  turnpike  from  Trenton  to  New  Brunswick,  and  fifteen 
miles  from  the  latter  city. 


SOUTH  BRUNSWICK  TOWNSHIP

Among  former  chosen  freeholders  have  been  Aaron  Dean,  John 
Smock,  Frederick  Farr,  Thomas  W.  Schenck,  Gabriel  Ten  Broeck, 
Clarence  M.  Slack  (afterward  county  clerk),  David  D.  Applegate,  John 
L.  Suydam  and  Andrew  Ely. 

The  present  township  officials  are :  N.  H.  Vreeland,  assessor ;  Ferd. 
S.  Rule,  collector  and  treasurer;  William  Oberman,  chairman;  Reuney 
D.  Petty  and  W.  W.  Emmons,  township  committee;  George  Walter; 
Walter  Suydam,  counsel;  Dr.  Edward  Carroll,  physician;  William  R. 
Perkins,  pi-esident;  Frank  R.  Stout,  clerk;  Reuney  D.  Petty,  Harvey  R. 
Dey,  Salter  Slover,  C.  B.  Garretson,  John  Terhune,  Noah  Golden  and

principal;  Board  of  Health — Township  committee,  assessor  and  town- 
ship physician. 


CHAPTER  XXXI. 

TOWNSHIPS  OF  MONROE,  MADISON,  RARITAN  AND 

CRANBURY. 

Monroe  is  the  most  southern  township  in  the  county,  and  is  bounded 
on  the  north  by  East  Brunswick  township,  on  the  east  by  Madison 
township  and  Monmouth  county,  on  the  south  by  Monmouth  and  Mercer 
counties,  and  on  the  west  by  Cranbury  and  South  Brunswick  township. 
It  was  named  in  honor  of  James  Monroe,  the  fifth  President  of  the 
United  States.  It  is  watered  centrally  by  the  Manalapan  river,  and  along 
its  eastern  border  by  Matchaponix  creek,  which,  uniting  at  its  northern 
extremity,  form  the  South  river.  These  two  streams  were  so  named 
by  the  Indians  as  descriptive  of  the  country  through  which  they  flow, 
as  it  was  regarded  by  them,  "manalapan"  signifying  a  good  country, 
producing  good  bread,  and  "matchaponix"  not  producing  anything  out 
of  which  good  bread  might  be  made.  The  surface  of  the  township  is 
rolling,  and  the  soil  quite  productive,  containing  clayey  and  sandy  loam 
to  a  considerable  extent. 

In  1684  the  Proprietors  of  East  Jersey  offered  to  grant  fifty  acres  of 
land  to  each  head  of  a  family  settling  in  the  Province,  and  twenty-five 
acres  to  each  member  of  the  family.  Acting  upon  this  offer  James 
Johnstone  came  from  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  in  1685,  and  settled  on  the 
southern  bank  of  Manalapan  river,  near  Spotswood,  and  within  the 
present  borders  of  Monroe  township.  He  soon  purchased  additional 
land,  extending  toward  Matchaponix  creek,  and  was  probably  the  first 
person  to  reclaim  land  in  the  township.  William  Davison,  another 
Scotsman,  located  on  a  tract,  part  of  which  is  now  within  the  limits  of 
Jamesburg  borough.  He  had  many  descendants,  who  did  much  in 
improving  the  land  and  promoting  the  agricultural  interests  in  that 
vicinity.  Other  early  settlers  were  Tice  and  Peter  Mount,  Englishmen, 
at  Matchaponix,  known  locally  afterward  as  "Texas,"  in  the  north- 
eastern part  of  the  township ;  also,  at  Matchaponix,  Joseph  Perrine,  of 
French  extraction,  his  ancestors  having  fled  from  France  after  the 
revocation  of  the  Edict  of  Nantes  in  1685,  and  came  to  Perth  Amboy  on 
the  "Caledonia."  Peter  Vanderhoof,  James  Gulick,  farmer  and  black- 
smith, and  Thomas  McDowell,  all  settled  at  Rhode  Hall,  now  in  East 
Brunswick  township.  James  Snediker,  of  Dutch  nativity,  located  near 
the  South  Brunswick  line,  and  lived  to  the  age  of  one  hundred.  Cornelius 
Van  Dome  and  Henry  Stults  settled  in  the  vicinity  of  Prospect  Plains. 

About  1745,  Rev.  David  Brainerd,  a  Scotsman,  who  as  a  missionary 
had  first  preached  to  the  Indians  in  the  woods  near  Albany,  New  York, 
turned  his  attention  to  the  Indians  at  the  forks  of  the  Delaware  and  at 


438  MIDDLESEX 

Crossweeksung,  and  his  labors  met  with  remarkable  success  in  the  fol- 
lowing year.  When  Alexander  Redmond  purchased  the  property  in 
1 841,  many  cellars  showing  the  location  of  the  Brainerd  settlement  were 
visible,  and  Mr.  Redmond  long  retained  stones  that  had  been  used 
as  hearths  and  many  relics  of  the  Indians  were  exhumed  there.  The 
brook  from  which  Wigwam  Grove  took  its  name  has  its  source  in 
springs  located  in  the  former  settlement.  An  old  deed  was  in  possession 
of  Mr.  Redmond  dated  July  12,  1754,  whereby  Rev.  John  Brainerd, 
brother  of  David,  conveyed  to  Peter  Deremer  the  land  adjacent  to 
Wigwam  brook,  including  lands  afterward  owned  by  the  Redmond 
family,  Edmund  Rue  and  the  James  Buckelew  estate.  The  historic 
character  of  this  locality  is  also  interesting  from  the  fact  that  Rev. 
William  Tennent,  at  that  time  the  remarkable  pastor  of  the  Tennent 
Church,  at  Englishtown,  Monmouth  county,  was  colaborer  of  Brainerd 
in  his  work.  On  the  Monroe  side  of  the  Manalapan  river  were  found 
remnants  of  a  dam  said  to  have  been  used  by  the  Forge.  Company  (Perry, 
Corne  and  Hays),  before  the  Revolution. 

The  old  burying  ground  on  the  farm  of  the  State  Home  for  Boys, 
near  Jamesburg,  is  undoubtedly  the  oldest  graveyard  in  the  township. 
An  old  building  that  stood  there  for  many  years,  it  is  said,  was  built 
during  the  French  war  of  1754-56,  and  was  used  for  the  confinement 
of  French  prisoners.  In  the  graveyard  are  headstones  bearing  date 
previous  to  that  time.  In  1778,  when  the  British  army  evacuated  Phila- 
delphia, and  the  American  soldiers  pursued  from  June  26th  to  the  28th, 
the  patriot  army  was  almost  within  hailing  distance  of  Jamesburg,  and 
the  inhabitants  were  very  much  in  evidence,  and  gave  all  the  aid  in 
their  power  to  their  brothers  in  arms.  William  Lyon,  a  Continental 
soldier,  served  throughout  the  war,  and  was  in  almost  all  the  battles 
in  which  the  Jersey  troops  were  engaged.  He  died  in  the  township  in 
1841. 

The  history  of  the  early  schools  at  Matchaponix  are  shrouded  in 
the  mists  of  antiquity.  They  were  of  the  kind  known  as  "pay"  schools, 
supported  by  popular  subscription,  and  do  not  appear  to  have  been 
kept  in  regular  school  houses.  The  first  remembered  were  log  cabins 
of  a  primitive  character,  and  the  teachers  were  men  who  came  to  the 
settlement  without  any  regular  employment  and  opened  schools,  depend- 
ing upon  the  voluntary  support  of  the  inhabitants.  A  desire  on  the  part 
of  many  citizens  for  more  educational  advantages  than  were  afforded 
by  the  public  schools  induced  Mr.  James  Buckelew  and  others  in  1873 
to  erect  a  building  for  the  use  of  an  academic  school,  and  to  be  known 
as  the  Jamesburg  Institute.  It  was  completed  and  opened  that  year 
by  Mr.  M.  Oakey,  and  proved  a  decided  success.  The  district  public 
schools  throughout  the  townships  are  now  known  as  follows:  Half- 
Acre,  Matchaponix,  Monroe,  Grove,  Old  Church  and  Gravel  Hill. 


MONROE  TOWNSHIP  439 

Monroe  township  was  created  by  act  of  the  Council  (Senate)  and 
General  Assembly  of  the  State  on  February  23,  1838,  and  included 
all  that  portion  o£  South  Amboy  township  lying  west  of  Matchaponix 
creek  and  Soiith  river,  consisting  of  about  22,000  acres.  A  portion  of 
East  Brunswick  township  was  taken  from  Monroe  in  i860,  and  a  por- 
tion of  Cranbury  township  in  1872.  The  first  town  meeting  was  held 
at  the  house  of  Jacob  Van  Cleef,  inn-keeper,  April  2,  1838.  Robert  R. 
Vanderberg  was  town  clerk  continuously  for  thirty-two  years.  The 
first  town  committee  consisted  of  Aaron  Gulick,  Peter  W.  Dey,  John 
Applegate,  Lewis  Riggs  and  Thomas  Potts.  Among  the  Chosen  Free- 
holders have  been  Joseph  C.  Magee,  David  M.  and  George  Perrine, 
Anthony  and  John  B.  Applegate,  Samuel  D.  Vanderberg,  Peter  Voor- 
hees,  William  Perrine,  Frank  Pownall  and  Robert  R.  Vanderberg. 

In  1845  James  Buckelew  and  Nathaniel  Rue  established  a  stage 
route  between  Jamesburg  and  Freehold,  connecting  with  the  railroad  to 
New  York,  carrying  in  the  second  year  5,000  through  passengers. 
Afterward  they  operated  a  through  line  from  Philadelphia  to  Long 
Branch,  which  gave  way  to  the  Freehold  &amp;  Jamesburg  Agricultural 
railroad,  which  began  to  run  trains  daily  from  Freehold  July  18,  1853. 

The  State  Home  for  Boys  (formerly  known  as  the  New  Jersey 
Reform  School),  providing  for  a  reform  farm  school  for  boys  between 
the  ages  of  eight  and  sixteen,  was  founded  by  the  Legislature  in  1865. 
A  farm  of  490  acres  was  purchased  near  Jamesburg,  buildings  erected, 
and  the  school  opened  July  6,  1867.  The  boys  are  taught  the  elementary 
branches  of  learning  and  are  accustomed  to  farming.  When  regarded 
as  fit  for  removal  (in  not  less  than  a  year  after  admission  to  the  school), 
homes  are  sought  for  them,  the  trustees  continuing  their  guardianship 
over  them  during  their  minority.  The  first  board  of  control  consisted 
of  Governor  Ludlow,  Chancellor  Runyon  and  Chief  Justice  Beasley, 
with  six  others,  among  whom  were  Moses  S.  Higbie,  of  South  Amboy, 
and  George  W.  Helme,  of  Jersey  City. 

The  Soldiers'  Monument  in  the  First  Presbyterian  Church  Cemetery, 
at  Cranbury,  bears  the  names  of  the  heroes  of  Monroe  who  gave  their 
lives  in  their  country's  service  during  the  Civil  War.  It  is  to  the  honor 
and  credit  of  the  township  that  in  response  to  the  demand  of  the  President 
for  the  township  quota  of  soldiers  in  1864,  a  subscription  was  raised  to 
defray  the  expense  of  placing  the  requisite  number  of  men  in  the  field, 
and  so  generous  was  the  response  that  only  half  the  money  subscribed 
was  required,  and  the  balance  was  returned  to  the  subscribers  pro  rata. 

The  Jamesburg  Sunday  School  Convention  Association  was  organ- 
ized in  1866,  and  continued  to  hold  annual  assemblages  in  Wigwam 
Grove  on  the  fourth  Wednesday  of  August  until  about  1900.  The  origi- 
nators were  John  Dunn  Buckelew,  T.  Wilton  Hill,  John  D.  and  Wm. 
H.  Courter,  Rev.  Dr.  Benjamin  S.  Everitt,  Alfred  Davison,  Joseph  C.

A.  I.  Richardson,  Franklin  and  Alfred  W.  Dey,  C.  W.  Johnson,  J.  B. 
Thompson  and  others.  It  is  estimated  that  as  many  as  12,000  persons 
attended  some  of  these  gatherings. 

Half-Acre  is  a  small  village,  about  two  and  one-half  miles  from 
Jamesburg.  There  are  several  curious  stories  as  to  how  it  gained  its 
name,  the  most  probable  one  being  that  in  ancient  times  there  were 
two  roads  passing  the  hostelry,  one  in  front  and  the  other  in  the  rear. 
The  latter  was  fenced  in  by  the  proprietor,  Daniel  Lott,  said  to  have 
been  the  first  occupant.  This  left  an  inclosure  behind  the  tavern  of 
half  an  acre,  which  caused  the  name  of  Half-Acre  to  be  applied  to  the 
inn  and  later  to  the  immediate  vicinity.  Prospect  Plains  is  a  station 
and  a  little  village  on  the  old  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  railroad,  on  the  western 
border  of  the  township.  Other  small  villages  and  hamlets  are  Red 
Tavern,  Union  Valley  and  Old  Church. 

The  following  are  the  principal  officials  of  the  township:  Assessor, 
Robert  R.  Vanderbergh ;  collector,  Ernest  A.  Mount ;  treasurer,  Harvey 
H.  Dey ;  clerk,  Fred  A.  Clayton ;  Board  of  Education — James  F.  Tilton, 
president;  Frank  M.  Denton,  A.  G.  Farr,  G.  Duer  Piatt,  Abijah  Apple- 
gate,  Raymond  Croshaw,  John  R.  and  Harry  M.  Dey;  and  George 
Mount,  clerk;  town  committee — ^John  H.  Butcher,  Howard  P.  Jemison 
and  Peter  F.  Dey;  counsel,  John  V.  B.  Wyckoff ;  and  physician.  Dr.  J.  C. 
Shinn,  Jamesburg. 

Madison  Township — ^This  township  is  on  the  eastern  border  of  the 
county,  slightly  south  of  the  centre,  and  is  a  little  more  than  eight  miles 
in  length,  with  an  average  width  of  about  four  miles.  Its  boundaries 
are.-  North,  South  Amboy  and  Raritan  Bay;  southeast,  Monmouth 
county;  southwest,  Monroe  township;  and  northwest,  East  Brunswick 
township  and  South  Amboy.  The  area  is  19,560  acres,  and  much  of  it 
was  formerly  heavily  wooded.  The  surface  is  rolling,  and  watered  by 
several  creeks  and  streams,  the  largest  being  Cheesequake  creek,  rising 
in  the  northern  part  and  emptying  into  the  Raritan  river  in  the  north- 
west corner  of  the  township,  forming  for  a  short  distance  the  boundary 
line  between  South  Amboy  and  Madison.  It  is  navigable  nearly  tj  its 
headwaters.  Deep  run,  a  mill  stream  of  some  importance,  furnishes 
good  water  power  in  the  western  portion  of  the  township,  and  empties 
into  South  river  a  little  northwest  of  the  Madison  line.  Tenant's  creek 
and  Iresick's  brook  both  flow  into  South  river,  the  former  near  the 
township  boundary  line,  and  the  latter  near  the  Bloomfield  Mills. 

South  river  and  Matchaponix  creek  wash  nearly  two-thirds  of  the 
western  border,  and  have  been  a  source  of  material  prosperity  to  the 
territory  adjacent  to  them.  The  portion  bordering  on  Monmouth  is 
considerably  higher  than  the  remainder  of  the  township,  and  more 
valuable  for  agricultural  purposes.     The  soil  is  red  shale  and  sandy 


MADISON  TOWNSHIP  441 

loam;  and  west  of  Cheesequake  creek  are  extensive  and  valuable  beds 
of  fire  and  potter's  clays,  which  are  a  leading  article  of  commerce.  The 
native  timber  is  pine,  cedar,  maple,  ash  and  various  varieties  of  oak, 
some  of  it  having  been  found  well  adapted  for  ship-building  and  com- 
manding a  ready  and  profitable  sale.  The  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  branch  of 
the  Pennsylvania  railroad  runs  along  the  northwestern  border  of  the 
township  for  some  distance.  Old  Bridge  and  Spotswood  being  conven- 
ient stations. 

It  is  probable  that  settlement  began  at  Cheesequake,  near  the  head 
of  navigation  on  Cheesequake  creek,  and  that  there,  and  in  the  Brown- 
town  neighborhood,  the  majority  of  the  pioneers  located.  The  first 
of  the  recorded  land  owners  did  not  become  residents;  but  purchasjcd 
the  property  with  a  view  to  its  future  value.  On  a  map  of  the  Raritan 
and  South  rivers,  and  the  country  bordering  them  for  some  distance 
inland,  which  was  made  between  1683  and  1686,  by  John  Reid,  deputy 
surveyor  under  George  Keith  (spoken  of  as  a  "disaffected  Quaker," 
sent  out  by  an  English  Episcopal  organization,  as  a  missionary) ,  several 
tracts  of  land  at  the  mouth  of  Cheesequake  creek  are  shown  as  belonging 
to  T.  L.  and  S.  Winder,  1,000  acres;  the  Scots  Proprietors  and  William 
Dockwra,  2,000  acres;  and  T.  Warne,  1,000,  portions  of  which  must 
have  been  in  the  township  as  at  present  bounded.  No  connection 
between  the  Warne  above  mentioned  and  the  present  family  of  that 
name  in  Madison  has  been  traced. 

David  Owens  settled  near  Cheesequake  about  1730.  One  of  his 
descendants  owned  a  farm  on  the  road  to  South  Amboy,  a  portion  of 
which  contained  one  of  the  clay  mines  of  Whitehead  Brothers,  of 
South  River.  David  Hall  at  an  early  date  located  on  the  road  from 
Cheesequake  to  Matawan,  Monmouth  county,  and  died  there  in  the 
early  part  of  1800,  leaving  several  descendants.  David  Bound  came 
from  Monmouth  county  about  1800,  and  owned  a  large  tract  of  land  along 
Raritan  Bay  shore.  Members  of  the  family  are  still  residents  of  the 
township.  Gen.  James  Morgan's  father  was  an  early  settler  in  Cheese- 
quake, was  largely  interested  in  land  extending  along  the  Cheesequake 
creek  to  its  mouth,  and  was  a  manufacturer  of  pottery  before  the  Revo- 
lution. The  general  removed  to  South  Amboy,  and  a  number  of  his 
descendants  continued  to  reside  there  for  many  years.  Thomas  Warne 
settled  on  the  Mount  Pleasant  and  Old  Bridge  turnpike  previous  to 
1800  and  purchased  a  tract  of  1,000  acres,  a  considerable  portion  of 
which  is  now  owned  by  numerous  descendants. 

Wynant  Wood  came  to  the  township  about  1800,  and  spent  the 
remainder  of  his  life  there,  leaving  a  large  family.  Edward  Furman, 
grandfather  of  the  late  Noah  Furman,  of  South  Amboy,  was  an  early 
settler  on  South  river,  near  Old  Bridge.  He  was  a  large  shipper  of 
wood  from  Old  Bridge  and  South  Amboy,  and  bought  and  sold  much

woodland.  Josiah  Burlew,  whose  fathef  emigrated  from  Bokoluh,  Han- 
over, Germany,  was  in  the  Revolutionary  War,  and  lived  on  the  main 
road  from  Qieesequake  to  South  Amboy.  His  descendants  still  reside 
in  the  township.  Mulford  Martin  was  an  early  resident  of  Piscataway, 
and  lived  for  a  time  in  South  Amboy  before  locating  in  Madison.  His 
son,  Mulford,  was  for  many  years  a  blacksmith  in  Cheesequake.  Among 
other  old  residents  were  the  Buckelews,  Gordons,  Hilliers,  Wrights, 
Clarks,  Seamans,  Provosts,  Bennetts  and  Bloodgoods. 

At  a  date  probably  considerably  before  the  Revolution,  a  paper  mill 
was  established  on  the  site  afterward  occupied  by  the  Tecumseh  Snuff 
Mills  and,  it  is  stated  on  good  authority,  in  it  was  manufactured  the 
paper  upon  which  the  Continental  money  was  printed.  In  1854  the 
Tecumseh  Snuff  Mills  were  built  by  Phineas  Skinner,  the  firm  eventu- 
ally becoming  Skinner  &amp;  Co.,  and  for  many  years  doing  an  immense 
and  profitable  business.  On  the  site  of  the  Bloomfield  Mills,  about 
midway  between  Old  Bridge  and  Spotswood,  on  South  river,  Embley 
&amp;  Keyser  began  the  manufacture  of  powder  in  1805,  and  continued  the 
business  until  1833,  when  the  plant  was  destroyed  by  an  explosion. 

Otto  Ernst  has  valuable  clay  mines  near  the  head  of  Cheesequake 
creek.  Other  clay  miners  have  been  Noah  Furman,  Theodore  Smith, 
Charles  B.  Reynolds,  the  Morgans  and  others.  The  Bloomfield  Mill 
Company  was  organized  in  1872  by  R.  Atkinson,  Richard  S.  and  F.  C. 
Conover  for  the  manufacture  of  licorice  from  the  licorice  root  imported 
from  Spain  and  Asia  Minor.  John  Dill  erected  a  snuff  mill  in  1830 
on  Deep  run,  near  the  Mount  Pleasant  and  Oldbridge  turnpike,  and  was 
succeeded  in  the  business  by  his  son,  William.  Peter  Jernee's  grist  mill, 
on  Tenant's  creek,  was  built  at  a  very  early  date. 

The  only  village  in  the  township  is  Cheesequake,  on  the  South 
Amboy  and  Mount  Pleasant  road,  at  the  head  of  Cheesequake  creek, 
lying  chiefly  in  the  fork  of  two  brooks  which  flow  together  to  form  that 
stream.  We  have  never  heard  the  origin  of  the  name.  One  theory  is 
that  the  marshy  ground  thereabout  suggests  the  "quaking  bogs"  that 
exist  in  Ireland.  An  effort  was  made  years  ago  to  rename  the  village 
Jacksonville,  in  honor  of  President  Andrew  Jackson;  but  the  laudable 
design  failed,  and  Cheesequake  it  remains  to  this  day.  Before  the 
advent  of  railroads  the  traffic  along  South  river  and  Cheesequake 
creek  was  large,  great  quantities  of  produce  and  commerce,  designed 
for  shipment  to  New  York,  being  brought  to  the  various  landings  from 
far  inland  by  teams  for  transfer  to  vessels.  Ship  yards  were  numerous, 
and  potteries  were  in  operation  throughout  the  whole  section  for  many 
years.  The  pioneer  tavern  was  the  old  Morgan  House,  established  by 
General  Morgan's  father  in  1750.  Other  hostelries  were  conducted  by 
Col.  Nathaniel  Hillier,  Stephen  Hall  and  James  Lamberson.  The 
earliest  merchant  was  Stephen  Hall,  who  had  a  grocery  store  in  1830. 


MADISON  TOWNSHIP  443 

For  many  years  former  Sheriff  Andrew  J.  Disbrow  was  a  leading  mer- 
chant and  business  man.  Courtney  Hall  also  had  a  store  in  1830  and  for 
a  number  of  years  later. 

The  Baptist  church  at  Cheesequake  was  erected  in  1832,  on  the  site 
formerly  occupied  by  a  log  cabin,  where  the  Old  School  Baptists  held 
divine  services.  Twice  each  year  Elder  Silas  H.  Durand  came  from 
Southampton,  Pennsylvania,  and  held  services  for  two  evenings,  being 
conveyed  thither  by  former  Sherifif-  Richard  Serviss.  On  several  occa- 
sions the  only  light  in  the  building  was  furnished  by  an  oil  lamp  on  the 
pulpit,  by  which  the  gray-haired  patriarch  read  his  text  from  the  Holy 
Book,  closed  the  volume  and  preached  eloquent  sermons  to  an  interested 
and  devoted  flock.  The  burying  ground  attached  contains  the  graves 
of  members  of  the  pioneer  families  about  the  Cheesequake  creek  and 
its  headwaters.  The  remains  of  others  who  came  later  were  interred 
in  the  Methodist  graveyard.  The  graves  of  Martha,  daughter  of  Seth 
Ellison ;  Obadiah,  Eleanor,  Abigail  and  Susan  Burlew,  and  T.  Rose  bear 
dates  ranging  from  1798  to  1825.  The  grave  of  Capt.  John  Bowne,  of 
the  Continental  army,  is  marked  with  a  brown  headstone,  brought  from 
England,  and  bears  the  following  inscription,  still  fairly  legible : 

How  lov'd,  how  honored  once  avails  thee  not, 
To  whom  related,  or  by  whom  begot. 
A  heap  of  dust  is  all  remains  of  me; 
'Tis  all  thou  art,  and  all  the  proud  shall  be. 

Occasional  funeral  services  occur,  but  no  regular  religious  meetings 
are  held  in  the  church. 

There  are  no  known  records  in  existence  of  the  Methodist  church 
that  will  give  any  idea  of  its  early  history.  After  the  organization  of 
the  society,  the  congregation  met  in  the  old  Baptist  church  until  the 
erection  of  the  present  house  of  worship,  which  stands  in  the  centre  of 
the  village.  The  oldest  grave  in  the  burying  ground  is  that  of  Thomas 
Clark,  bearing  date  July  30,  1805.  Other  graves  bear  the  names  of 
Mellenney,  Mary,  William  and  Joshua  Warne,  William  and  John  R. 
Hall,  Elizabeth  Herbert,  Francis  Bloodgood  and  Noah  Furman. 

Browntown  is  a  small  neighborhood,  and  owes  its  designation  to 
the  families  of  that  name  who  resided  in  the  locality.  From  an  ancient 
document,  still  in  an  excellent  state  of  preservation,  we  learn  that  John 
and  Susannah  Brown  lived  in  a  log  cabin  in  1737.  One  of  his  grand- 
children, Abram,  became  a  State  Senator,  sheriff,  and  was  a  justice  of 
the  peace  for  many  years.  His  son,  the  late  Hendrick  H.  Brown,  was  a 
lay  judge  of  the  Court  of  Errors  and  Appeals  and  also  of  the  Middlesex 
Court  of  Common  Pleas,  a  town  committeeman,  and  held  several  other 
offices.  -Clarkson  Brown,  no  relative  of  the  above,  was  a  prominent 
surveyor,  and  left  a  number  of  descendants. 

The  public  schools  are  at  Morristown,  Cheesequake,  Cedar  Grove, 


444  MIDDLESEX 

Browntown,  Brunswick  Gardens,  Hillsboro  and  Millbridge.    The  Super- 
vising Principal  is  Raymond  E.  Voorhees. 

The  township  was  organized  March  2,  1869,  with  the  following 
officers :  Assessor,  Courtney  H.  Warne ;  collector,  Abram  Warne ;  town- 
ship committee,  Charles  Brown,  Hendrick  H.  Brown,  A.  L.  Warne, 
George  Dobson  and  Obadiah  Clark;  clerk,  Martin  L.  Burlew.  The 
present  officials  are:  Assessor,  Robert  Higgins;  collector,  Harry  W. 
Lambertson;  township  committee,  Ebenezer  Bowne,  president;  Wil- 
liam Oertel  and  Richard  Burlew;  clerk,  Frederick  Schulemeister ;  coun- 
sel. Judge  Henry  Ackerson ;  physician.  Dr.  Ira  C.  Crandall ;  board  of  edu- 
cation, Arthur  W.  Brown,  president ;  Samuel  Cosgrove,  Walter  D.  Ben- 
nett, William  Miller,  Luther  H.  Quackenbush,  Jacob  Gaub,  Charles 
Eifert,  Parkinson,  Dill;  and  William  C.  Ludi,  clerk.  Among  former 
chosen  freeholders  have  been  Lawrence  K.  Hillier,  David  H.  Brown, 
William  R.  Dill,  Abram,  Ira,  Courtney  and  Hezekiah  Warne,  Joseph 
Driskell  and  Asbury  Fountain,  the  last  named  being  the  director  for 
a  number  of  years. 

Raritan  Township — This  township,  formed  from  portions  of  Wood- 
bridge  and  Piscataway  townships  on  March  17,  1870,  derives  its  name 
from  the  river  that  constitutes  its  southern  boundary,  and  which  took 
its  title  from  the  Indian  tribe  that  dwelled  in  the  hills  and  vales  along 
its  banks.  The  Indian  word,  Raritan,  means  "forked  river,"  and  refers 
to  the  two  streams  that  united  to  form  it.  The  township  is  generally 
described  as  equal  portions  of  Woodbridge  and  Piscataway  townships, 
bordering  on  the  Raritan  river,  and  extending  back  therefrom  about 
three  miles,  the  boundaries  being:  On  the  north  by  the  Union  county 
line,  on  the  east  by  Woodbridge  township,  on  the  south  by  Raritan  river 
and  on  the  west  by  Piscataway  township.  This  territory  has,  therefore, 
practically  the  same  history,  in  its  earliest  days,  as  the  above-mentioned 
townships.  The  pioneer  settlers  were  the  Stelles,  Martins,  Campbells, 
Bonhams,  Dunns,  Dunhams,  Edgars,  Comptons,  Tappens,  Thornalls, 
Hamptons,  Ackens,  Laings,  Kellys,  Ayres,  Freemans,  Bloomfields, 
Paynes,  Robins,  Mundys,  Carmans,  Rowlands,  Laforges  and  others. 

The  village  of  Piscataway  town  (formerly  a  part  of  that  township), 
is  the  earliest  settlement,  dating  back  to  1668,  and  described  as  three 
miles  from  New  Brunswick,  one  mile  from  the  Raritan  river  and  on  the 
turnpike  road  from  that  city  to  Woodbridge,  and  contains  an  Episcopal 
church,  a  Baptist  chapel,  a  store  and  some  twelve  dwellings.  It  was 
an  old  Indian  village,  and  was  once  the  seat  of  justice  for  Middlesex 
and  Somerset  counties,  the  courts  being  held  alternately  at  that  p'.ace 
and  at  Woodbridge.  Stelton,  about  four  miles  from  New  Brunswick, 
on  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  was  settled  by  the  Stelles  in  1668.  Bon- 
hamtown,  five  miles  northeast  from  New  Brunswick,  was  named  for 
Nicholas  Bonham,  who  was  one  of  the  first  settlers,  having  become  a 


RARITAN  TOWNSHIP  445 

freeholder  in  1682,  and  so  recorded  as  owner  of  lands  by  allotment. 
The  majority  of  the  above-mentioned  came  from  Newbury,  Massachu- 
setts, and  the  balance  were  probably  passengers  on  the  vessels  "Henry 
and  Francis"  and  "Caledonia,"  both  sailing  from  Scotland  and  landing 
at  Perth  Amboy.    Many  of  these  were  Presbyterian  Covenanters. 

It  was  at  Stelton,  alluded  to  above,  that  the  Baptists  established 
the  first  church  organization  in  1680.  In  1748  the  first  house  of  worship 
was  erected,  very  near  the  site  of  the  present  church.  This  was  taken 
down  in  1824  and  in  the  following  year  a  larger  building  was  erected, 
which  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  1859,  ^"^  the  present  church  was  built 
in  the  same  year.  The  pastor  for  about  fifty  years,  and  up  to  about 
1739,  was  John  Drake,  one  of  the  early  settlers.  He  was  succeeded  by 
Benjamin  Stelle,  of  Huguenot  ancestry,  who  served  for  twenty  years, 
and  was  followed  by  his  son,  Isaac,  who  was  pastor  till  1781.  From 
1783  till  1812  Reune  Runyon,  son  of  an  early  settler,  was  the  pastor. 
The  chapel  in  Piscatawaytown  was  an  adjunct  of  the  old  church.  Rev. 
L.  H.  Chamberlin  is  the  present  pastor. 

St.  James'  Protestant  Episcopal  Church  was  established  in  1704  in 
Piscatawaytown,  but  it  was  not  until  twenty  years  later  that  the  build- 
ing was  completed.  It  was  completely  destroyed  by  a  tornado  in  1835, 
and  the  present  church  was  erected  during  the  same  year.  The  first 
officiating  clergymen  were  the  Messrs.  Brooks  (who  commenced  his 
labors  in  1704),  Vaughan,  Halliday  and  Keith.  The  parish  subsequently 
passed  into  the  charge  of  the  missionaries  at  New  Brunswick,  and  for 
many  years  was  under  the  pastoral  care  of  Rev.  Dr.  Alfred  Stubbs,  of 
that  city.  Among  the  vestrymen  we  find  the  names  of  Hopewell  Hull, 
Thomas  Wetherell,  John  T.  Martin,  Joel  Dunham,  John  Conway  and 
Edward  Allen.  The  present  rector  is  Rev.  Mr.  Gilford.  The  oldest 
gravestone  in  the  cemetery  bears  the  name  of  John  Borrowe,  died  April 
9,  1733,  aged  sixty-six  years. 

The  first  school  house,  built  of  logs  in  1694,  was  in  Piscatawaytown, 
near  the  old  burying  ground,  adjoining  the  church.  It  was  destroyed 
by  the  tornado  in  1835,  rebuilt  in  1837  and  enlarged  in  1852.  The  most 
notable  figure  in  educational  affairs  during  the  early  part  of  the  last 
century  was  Bethune  Duncan.  Born  in  Boston,  June  6,  1786,  he  came 
to  the  Oak  Tree  school  as  teacher  in  1819  and  served  as  such  for  forty- 
five  years,  having  as  pupils  the  children  of  three  generations.  His  former 
mercantile  training,  united  to  a  good  English  education,  and  a  genuine 
love  for  books  and  children,  rendered  him  exceptionally  capable  as  a 
teacher.  An  excellent  penman,  thorough  in  spelling,  arithmetic  and 
bookkeeping,  a  disciplinarian  and  devoted  to  his  work,  he  proved  most 
successful  in  his  chosen  work.  Full  of  years,  and  beloved  by  young 
and  old,  he  returned  to  the  home  of  his  sister  in  Waltham,  Massachusetts, 
and  there  passed  the  remainder  of  his  life.

During  the  Revolution  five  British  regiments  were  stationed  at 
Bonhamtown,  and  robbed  and  harried  the  residents  for  a  considerable 
period,  burning  the  houses  and  barns,  and  committing  other  outrages. 
The  people  were  very  loyal  to  the  patriot  cause.  Captain  Nathaniel 
Leonard,  who  served  throughout  the  war,  died  in  1803,  and  is  buried  in 
the  old  Presbyterian  cemetery,  near  the  railroad  station,  in  Metuchen. 
In  this  ancient  "God's  Acre"  are  gravestones  with  dates  ranging  from 
1731  to  1836,  and  bearing  the  names  of  Campbell,  Compton,  Ayres,  Car- 
man, Bloomfield,  Eddy,  Ford,  Freeman,  Knapp,  Hampton,  Kelly,  Laforg^ 
and  many  others.  The  oldest  is  that  of  John  Campbell,  1731,  aged  72 
years.  Next  to  that  is  the  grave  of  Neil  Campbell,  who  died  1777,  aged 
forty-three.  Lord  Neil  Campbell,  brother  of  the  Duke  of  Argyle,  and 
like  him  obnoxious  to  the  English  government,  was  obliged  to  flee  from 
Scotland,  and  arrived  at  Perth  Amboy,  with  members  of  his  family 
and  retainers,  in  1685.  The  two  mentioned  above  were  probably  km 
of  the  famous  family. 

The  first  township  election  was  held  April  16,  1870,  in  the  old  Me- 
tuchen Academy  with  the  following  result:  Luther  H.  Tappen,  assessor; 
Charles  C.  Campbell,  collector;  Manning  Freeman,  W.  E.  Crowell, 
Augustus  Blackford,  Theodore  A.  Wood  and  Augustus  Stelle,  town 
committee;  John  T.  Martin,  clerk;  Michael  M.  Lupardus  and  Lewis 
Thomas,  chosen  freeholders ;  Israel  Thornall,  overseer  of  poor.  Among 
other  chosen  freeholders  have  been  R.  Bruce  Crowell,  Alexander  Camp- 
bell, Thomas  N.  Acken,  Manning  Freeman,  Forman  Martin  and  Luther 
Tappen.  Freeman  and  Tappen  were  also  members  of  the  General 
Assembly.  Henry  and  Thomas  N.  Acken,  Lupardus,  Chas.  C.  Campbell 
and  Wm.  F.  Carman  have  been  sheriffs. 

There  are  eight  excellent  schools,  viz :  At  Piscatawaytown,  Bon- 
hamtown, Oak  Tree,  Stelton,  Fords,  New  Durham,  Menio  Park  and 
Lafayette,  with  1,200  pupils,  and  Charles  Runyon  as  supervising  princi- 
pal. The  board  of  education  is  composed  of  the  following:  Charles 
Anderson,  president;  Otto  Will  clerk;  Oliver  Kelly,  W.  T.  Woerner, 
Jere.  W.  Letson,  Jacob  Becker,  William  F.  Miller,  Percival  E.  Dixon, 
and  John  O'Connor.    William  R.  Drake,  custodian. 

One  of  principal  interests  of  the  township  is  the  mining,  shipping 
and  manufacturing  of  fire-clay,  fire-sand  and  kaolin.  The  M.  D.  Val- 
entine &amp;  Brother  Co.  has  an  extensive  factory  midway  between  Fords 
and  Metuchen,  on  the  line  of  the  Lehigh  Valley  railroad,  where  a  large 
amount  of  fire-brick  is  made.  The  Raritan  Ridge  Clay  Company,  with 
mines  and  docks  on  the  Raritan,  is  a  large  shipper  of  clay,  sand  and 
kaolin.  The  late  firm  of  Robert  N.  and  Howard  Valentine,  Henry 
Maurer  &amp;  Sons  and  Charles  Bloomfield,  are  also  miners  and  shippers. 
The  Pennsylvania  railroad  passes  through  the  township  east  and  west, 
while  the  Lehigh  road,  passing  through  from  Easton  to  the  coal  fields, 
gives  all  needed  fuel  to  the  factories  and  dwellings.

The  New  Dover  M.  E.  Church  was  built  in  1848  by  an  organized 
congregation,  after  it  became  united  with  the  Woodbridge  church  in  the 
preceding  year.  At  the  Conference  in  1850  it  was  made  a  separate 
charge.  In  1856  the  Metuchen  church  was  united  with  New  Dover ;  but 
the  latter  was  again  made  a  separate  charge  in  1858,  and  has  so  con- 
tinued until  the  present  time.  The  pulpit  is  filled  by  supplies  from  the 
Conference. 

New  Durham,  near  the  border  between  Piscataway  and  Raritan  town- 
ships, is  a  hamlet  composed  of  a  number  of  families  and  a  school  house. 
Menlo  Park,  on  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  a  few  miles  from  Metuchen, 
has  a  few  houses,  a  postoffice  and  a  school.  Thomas  A.  Edison,  the 
noted  inventor,  made  it  his  home  for  several  years,  and  built  a  minia- 
ture electric  railway  there,  before  he  removed  to  Orange. 

The  present  township  ofiScers  are  W.  T.  Woerner,  assessor ;  Paul  F. 
Randolph,  collector;  W.  R.  Woodward,  clerk;  S.  W.  Heath,  Martin 
Conway  and  Everett  B.  Tappen,  committee;  William  R.  Drake,  treas- 
urer; and  Edmund  A.  Hayes,  counsel. 

Cranbury  Township — Cranbury,  originally  containing  nine  thousand 
one  hundred  and  sixteen  acres,  is  territorially  the  smallest  township 
in  the  county  and  was  the  last  organized.  In  its  entirety  it  is  the  most 
southern,  although  the  southern  extremity  of  Monroe  extends  further 
southward.  It  is  bounded  north  by  South  Brunswick  and  Monroe 
townships,  east  by  Monroe,  south  by  Mercer  county  and  west  for  a 
short  distance  also  by  Mercer  county.  The  surface  is  slightly  rolling, 
and  the  soil  well  cultivated  and  generally  quite  productive.  It  is 
drained  by  Cranbury  brook,  which  flows  across  it  from  east  to  west, 
and  the  Millstone  river,  which  runs  along  its  southern  border.  The 
Amboy  division  of  the  Pennsylvania  railroad  marks  a  portion  of  the 
eastern  border  and  the  main  line  of  the  same  road  crosses  the  township 
near  its  southern  extremity. 

The  earliest  records  are  to  the  effect  that  after  the  confirmation  of 
the  grant  of  East  Jersey  to  the  twenty-four  Proprietors  by  the  Duke 
of  York  (March  14,  1682),  John  Haywood  and  Thomas  Cooper  being 
included  in  the  twenty-four,  that  Haywood  conveyed  his  share  to  Robert 
Burnett,  who  divided  his  land  and  sold  it  in  parcels,  one  of  which, 
embracing  a  tract  in  Cranbury,  bounded  east  by  George's  road  and  south 
by  Cranbury  brook,  was  granted  in  1703  by  Isabella  McKenzie  to 
Philip  French,  of  New  York  City.  In  1734  French  sold  this  tract  to 
Noah  Burton,  who  sold  the  part  on  which  nearly  the  whole  of  the 
northern  portion  of  Cranbury  has  been  built,  to  Samuel  Leonard.  From 
him  it  passed  to  Peter  Wyckoff,  and  a  portion  of  it  is  still  in  the  pos- 
session of  his  descendants.  Cooper  appears  to  have  retained  the  land 
embracing  that  part  of  the  village  south  of  the  brook  until  1683,  when 
he  sold  one-half  nf  his  tract  to  Sir  John  Gordon,  whose  son,  Robert 


448  MIDDLESEX 

Gordon,  sold  the  same  to  John  Rochead  in  1720.  In  1736,  Rochead 
conveyed  four  and  one-half  acres  along  the  brook  to  Thomas  Grubbs, 
doubtless  as  a  site  for  a  grist  mill,  as  it  is  recorded  in  1741  that  Grubbs 
conveyed  the  same  lot,  together  with  a  grist  mill,  to  John  Collins.  It 
is  not  known  how  large  a  settlement  at  that  time  had  grown  up  about 
the  mill,  which  must  be  regarded  as  the  probable  nucleus  of  the  town. 
The  settlement  received  its  name  from  the  brook  on  whose  banks  it  had 
its  beginning,  and  the  village  transmitted  the  name  to  the  township. 
When  and  by  whom  Cranbury  brook  was  named  is  not  known,  and  in 
former  years  it  was  often  erroneously  spelled  "Cranberry."  The  name 
of  the  fruit  cranberry  is  of  Scotch  origin.  It  was  called  "craneberry," 
from  a  real  or  fancied  resemblance  of  its  stem  to  the  neck  of  a  crane, 
and  was  modified  by  dropping  the  "e."  It  was  the  badge  of  the  clan 
Grant.  The  name  was  undoubtedly  given  to  the  brook  from  the  fact 
that  the  berries  were  found  upon  its  meadows.  The  old  British  custom, 
which  our  early  fathers  followed,  was  to  call  a  district  or  town  a  bor- 
ough, which  was  contracted  into  "burg,"  or  "bury."  When  the  village 
began  to  grow  it  was  called  Cranborough,  or,  contracting  it,  Cranbury. 
It  is  possible  that  a  few  later  settlers  located  west  of  the  present  town, 
toward  Plainsboro;  but  it  is  not  considered  probable.  In  July,  1739, 
James  Rochead  conveyed  to  Coert  Van  Voorhees  and  Thomas  Storey 
a  lot  adjoining  the  mill  property,  "to  be  for  the  use  of  the  Elders  and 
Deacons  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  of  Cranbury,  for  erecting  a  house 
of  worship,  in  consideration  of  Two  Pounds  to  him  in  hand  duly  paid." 

The  settlement  must  by  that  date  have  contained  a  number  of 
families,  as  a  church  had  been  formally  organized.  Voorhees  and  Storey 
conveyed  the  lot  to  Nicholas  Stevens  and  Peter  Perrine,  elders,  and 
John  Brown  and  William  Magee,  deacons  of  said  church,  which  is 
thought  to  have  been  only  recently  organized.  At  the  meeting  of  the 
Presbytery  of  New  Brunswick  in  1738,  John  Chambers  came,  as  a 
commissioner  from  Cranbury,  asking  for  a  supply.  Rev.  Gilbert  Ten- 
nent  was  appointed  to  preach  there  and  at  Allentown,  Monmouth  county. 
At  a  subsequent  meeting,  in  the  autumn  of  the  same  year,  Stephen 
Wagner  presented  a  petition  from  the  people  of  Cranbury  and  vicinity, 
asking  advice  concerning  a  house  of  worship.  It  appears  that  Presby- 
terians and  "people  of  the  Church  of  England  persuasion,"  as  they  were 
termed,  had  united  in  building  a  church  on  the  spot  afterward  occupied 
by  the  "Old  Church"  school  house,  east  of  Cranbury,  in  Monroe  town- 
ship. When  the  house  was  built,  and  how  it  was  used,  it  has  not  been 
possible  to  ascertain ;  but  a  school  was  conducted  there  for  many  years. 
The  Presbytery  met  at  Cranbury  and  advised  that  one  of  the  parties 
sell  their  right.  The  Presbyterians  evidently  sold  out,  for  the  next  year 
they  took  measures  to  erect  a  church  near  the  mill.  A  number  of  the 
early  settlers  have  been  alluded  to,  and  among  others  may  be  mentioned 


CRANBURY  TOWNSHIP  449 

Thomas  Duncan,  John  Van  Kirk,  Matthias  Mount,  Joseph  Clayton, 
Charles  Barclay,  Matthew  Griggs,  Reuben  Davison,  Stephen  Pangborn, 
Peter  Gulick,  William  Dey,  Peter  Bergen,  Robert  Mershon,  Andrew 
Applegate,  Henry  Stults,  Joshua  Ely,  William  Jewell,  John  Reed,  John 
Van  Dyke,  Jacob  Deremer  and  others.  In  the  journal  of  Rev.  David 
Brainerd,  missionary  to  the  Indians,  appears  this  record:  "June  i8, 
1745.  In  the  afternoon  came  to  a  place  called  Cranbury,  and  lodged  with 
Rev.  Charles  McKnight."  The  latter  was  pastor  of  the  Presbyterian 
church,  1744-1778.  In  1746,  Brainerd,  with  some  of  his  Indian  con- 
verts and  followers,  came  to  this  vicinity.  At  the  north  end  of  the  town 
stood  a  lordly  elm,  under  whose  branches  he  preached  to  his  aboriginal 
congregation.  The  most  friendly  relations  existed  between  Brainerd 
and  McKnight,  and  it  is  said  they  often  preached  for  each  other. 

The  early  growth  of  the  village  was  very  slow,  and  in  1810  there  were 
only  fifteen  houses.  David  Chambers  appears  to  have  been  the  first 
storekeeper,  doing  business  near  the  mill  in  1800,  and  was  there  for 
years  afterward.  In  1807,  one  Halsey  had  a  store  near  the  site  of  the 
old  United  States  Hotel,  and  nearby  Mershon  and  Hawley  opened  a 
store  in  1812.  Charles  Carson  was  in  business  from  1815  till  1823.  The 
next  merchants  were  Reuben  Morris  and  Benjamin  M.  Clarke,  the  latter 
continuing  until  about  1830.  The  first  hotel,  the  "United  States,"  stood 
on  the  Main  street,  about  six  hundred  feet  east  of  the  mill  pond,  and 
was  built  by  Peter  Perrine  as  a  dwelling;  but  was  converted  into  a 
hotel  by  Timothy  Horner  in  1805.  The  American  Hotel  was  conducted 
by  Henry  Wagoner  at  an  early  date,  and  in  1868  was  owned  and  kept 
by  Mrs.  Maria  Bowne.  It  was  removed  to  a  side  street,  near  Main, 
renovated,  and  is  now  used  by  the  Free  Public  Library.  The  first  resident 
physician  was  Dr.  Titus,  who  came  prior  to  1800,  and  Dr.  Ralph  Lott 
and  Dr.  Van  Dyke  located  here  in  that  year.  Dr.  Horatio  Stansbury 
came  in  1816,  Dr.  John  Lott  in  1825,  Dr.  Garret  Voorhees  in  1830,  and 
Dr.-  Selah  Gulick  in  1834.  It  would  seem  the  locality  was  not  remarkably 
healthful. 

The  water  power  of  Cranbury  brook  was  first  utilized  in  1738.  The 
mill  of  Thomas  Grubbs,  built  in  that  year,  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  i860, 
but  soon  rebuilt.  The  WyckofF  mills,  in  the  extreme  southeastern  part 
of  the  township,  were  built  in  1871.  The  grist  mill  of  Joseph  H.  Grover 
was  midway  between  Cranbury  and  Plainsboro,  and  that  of  George  W. 
Thompson  was  located  at  the  latter  place.  The  following  artisans  were 
busy  in  the  early  days:  Isaac  De  Bow,  blacksmith,  1750;  Matthew  A. 
Rue  and  John  Hagerman,  wheelwrights ;  William  Conover,  Aaron  Lane, 
Henry  Van  Deventer,  David  Chambers,  and  John  and  James  Clark, 
tanners;  Isaac  Van  Arsdale,  hats;  M.  A.  Rue  and  Nathaniel  Britton, 
distillers.  Commencing  in  1861  Peter  Bergen  for  many  years  manu- 
factured carriages  and  light  wagons  of  every  description.

The  principal  business  of  the  town  is  the  American  Steam  Coffee  and 
Spice  Mills,  established  by  the  late  John  S.  Davison  and  John  S.  Silvers 
in  1866,  and  now  known  as  the  J.  S.  Silvers  &amp;  Bro.  Co.,  with  the  fol- 
lowing officers:  J.  J.  Bradley,  president;  Abram  Voorhees,  treasurer; 
and  C.  Raymond  Wicoff,  secretary.  The  business  has  steadily  increased 
from  the  year  of  its  beginning,  and  it  now  ranks  as  one  of  the  largest 
of  its  kind  in  the  country.  The  National  Musical  String  Company,  of 
New  Brunswick,  has  a  branch  factory  in  the  south  end  of  the  town. 

The  first  schools  in  the  township  were  in  Cranbury  village,  and  were 
supported  by  the  payment  of  a  stated  tuition  per  scholar,  and  kept  in 
school  houses  built  by  subscription.  The  teachers  boarded  with  the 
different  families,  staying  with  each  a  week  or  more,  or  as  long  as  he 
was  welcome  and  liked  the  fare.  The  village  had  two  schools  previous 
to  1896,  one  in  the  north  and  the  other  in  the  south  end  of  the  town,  the 
former  being  called  "Bunker  Hill,"  and  the  latter  the  "Academy."  In 
the  above  year  the  districts  were  consolidated  and  the  present  fine 
brick  building  was  erected.  There  are  eight  rooms,  with  as  many 
teachers,  and  the  pupils  are  carried  through  the  eighth  grade.  There  is 
an  attendance  of  two  hundred.  Miss  Laura  Scudder  is  the  principal. 
The  following  compose  the  Board  of  Education :  Le  Roy  Scott,  president ; 
S.  H.  Perrine,  clerk;  Howard  J.  Butcher,  E.  S.  Barclay,  George  B. 
Mershon,  A.  C.  Grover,  Grover  Stults,  Raymond  Griggs ;  and  W.  F. 
Perrine,  custodian.    Floyd  L.  Evans  is  the  supervising  principal. 

There  was  a  Presbyterian  church,  more  or  less  organized,  in  July, 
1739,  as  has  been  previously  stated.  No  record  can  be  found  of  the 
organization,  although  the  date  was  probably  1738.  The  new  building 
was  erected  in  1740  and  stood  for  forty-eight  years  on  the  highest  part 
of  the  old  cemetery.  There  was  no  settled  pastor  until  July  18,  1744, 
when  Rev.  Charles  McKnight  was  installed.  Rev.  William  Tennent, 
of  Freehold,  preaching  the  sermon.  Mr.  McKnight,  though  unmarried, 
kept  house,  as  is  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  Brainerd,  the  missionary, 
lodged  with  him,  and  it  is  entered  in  the  minutes  of  the  Presbytery, 
October  5,  1746,  "Mr.  McKnight  could  not  attend  with  the  committee 
to  install  Mr.  Hunter,  because  he  was  absent  marrying  a  wife."  For 
forty  years  there  are  no  records  of  the  church.  Mr.  McKnight  removed 
to  Allentown  in  1756,  and  thence  to  Shrewsbury  and  Middletown  Point, 
Monmouth  county,  in  1767.  It  is  an  indication  of  his  sympathy  with  the 
colonies  that  during  the  Revolutionary  War  his  church  was  burned, 
and  that  he  was  seized  by  the  British.  He  died  in  New  York,  January 
I,  1778,  and  was  buried  in  Trinity  churchyard. 

The  church  was  without  a  stated  pastor  for  six  years,  until  1762, 
and  during  this  interval  the  parsonage  property  was  purchased.  Rev. 
Thomas  Smith  was  installed  pastor  in  1762  and  remained  a,s  such  until 
his  death,  December  23,  1789.    During  his  ministry,  in  1788,  a  new  church 


CRANBURY  TOWNSHIP  451 

was  erected  where  the  present  house  now  stands.  It  is  to  be  regretted 
that  we  know  nothing  of  the  church  during  the  Revolution,  and  have 
no  list  of  the  officers  and  soldiers  of  the  army.  In  1790  one  hundred 
and  fifty  acres,  formerly  the  property  of  James  Rochead,  was  conveyed 
to  Nathaniel  Hunt,  Jonathan  Combs,  Thomas  McDowell,  Jacob  Fisher, 
William  Cowenhoven,  Samuel  Longstreet  and  Humphrey  Mount,  trus- 
tees of  the  church.  Rev.  Gilbert  Tennent,  of  Philadelphia,  was  installed 
September  24,  1790,  and  was  a  zealous  and  faithful  pastor  until  February 
20,  1797,  when  he  died  from  yellow  fever,  contracted  during  a  visit  to 
New  York.  Rev.  George  Spofford  Woodhull,  son  of  Dr.  John  Woodhull, 
of  Freehold,  was  pastor  for  twenty-two  years,  and  accepted  a  call  to 
Princeton  in  1820.  Rev.  Symmes  Cleves  Henry,  son  of  James  Henry, 
of  Lamington,  colonel  in  the  New  Jersey  Militia,  was  made  pastor  in 
1820,  and  continued  as  such  until  his  death,  March  22,  1857.  His  son- 
in-law.  Rev.  Joseph  G.  Symmes,  then  of  Madison,  Illinois,  succeeded  him 
and  served  the  church  until  his  death  in  1894,  and  was  followed  by  Rev. 
J.  E.  Curry,  the  present  pastor.  In  1838  a  diversity  of  opinion  arose  as 
to  building  a  new  church,  the  building  then  occupied  being  filled  to  over- 
flowing. This  resulted  in  the  formation  of  the  Second  Church.  In 
1840  the  old  church  was  rebuilt  and  considerably  enlarged.  The 
building  is  handsomely  furnished  and  evidently  receives  the  best  of 
care.  On  the  wall  hangs  the  framed  charter,  granted  by  King  George 
II.,  of  England,  dated  February  23,  1750,  approved  by  the  Royal  Council 
assembled  at  Burlington,  and  signed  by  Jonathan  Belcher,  Governor  and 
Captain-General  of  the  Province  of  New  Jersey,  to  the  Presbyterian 
Church  of  Monmouth  county,  and  naming  the  first  trustees,  as  follows : 
John  Little,  Jr.,  Christopher  Longstreet,  Jonathan  Forman,  John  Ander- 
son, James  Robinson,  John  Henderson,  Stephen  Pangborne,  Robert 
Imlay,  and  Tobias  Polhemus.  Colonies  have  gone  out  from  this  church 
to  form  the  following  churches,  in  whole,  or  in  part :  Spotswood  Re- 
formed, 1816;  Millstone,  1826;  Second  Cranbury,  1838;  Jamesburg,  1854; 
Manalapan,  1856;  and  Hightstown,  1857.  In  one  hundred  and  thirty 
years  there  were  but  six  pastors.  How  many  churches  can  show  such 
a  record? 

Those  who  had  withdrawn  from  the  First  Church,  as  above  stated, 
built  a  church,  which  was  dedicated  June  26,  1838,  and  Rev.  J.  W. 
Blythe  was  installed  as  the  first  pastor  of  the  Second  Presbyterian 
Church.  The  first  Ruling  Elders  were  Jacob  and  Isaac  G.  Snediker, 
Elias  Day,  Aaron  Lane,  Dominicus  Mershon  and  John  Covert.  A 
new  chapel  was  built  in  1869  to  replace  the  former  one,  which  was  sold 
and  removed.  Many  members  of  the  church  were  united  with  the 
Jamesburg  church  in  1854,  the  Manalapan  church  in  1856,  the  Hights- 
town church  in  1857,  and  the  Dayton  church  in  1869.  A  cemetery 
of  about  three  acres  adjoins  the  church,  and  was  established  in  1838. 
The  present  pastor  is  the  Rev.  Frederick  Schweitzer.

Previous  to  1847  Methodist  services  were  held  at  the  houses  of 
members  of  an  organization  of  that  denomination  wrhich  had  then  been 
formed.  On  December  10,  1847,  the  organization  was  perfected  and  the 
following  trustees  were  elected:  Matthew  A.  Rue,  Isaac  Silvers,  Elijah 
Brown,  Gilbert  S.  Day,  James  Prall  and  Reuben  Sutphen.  A  church 
was  erected  and  dedicated  March  13,  1851,  with  Rev.  John  B.  Hill,  the 
first  settled  pastor.  In  1868  the  membership  had  increased  to  such 
an  extent  that  the  church  was  enlarged,  thoroughly  renovated,  and  pro- 
vided with  a  spire  and  bell.    Rev.  L.  E.  Lennox  is  the  pastor. 

A  number  of  Baptists  located  in  the  village  at  an  early  date,  and 
established  a  church  in  1749.  In  1788  it  was  removed  to  Hightstown.  A 
burying  ground  existed  during  the  time  it  was  here ;  but  was  practically 
abandoned  after  the  removal.  The  last  headstones  had  the  dates  1761 
and  1783,  and  bore  the  names  of  John  Taylor  and  John  Chamberlain. 
The  Mutual  Fire  Insurance  was  organized  May  31,  1879,  with  the  fol- 
lowing officers:  Ezekiel  Silvers,  president;  Richard  C.  Dey,  vice-presi- 
dent ;  D.  C.  Lewis,  treasurer ;  John  G.  Groves,  secretary ;  Alfred  Davison, 
Isaac  Covert,  William  S.  Dey,  John  R.  Hunt,  Martin  Cruser,  Arnold 
F.  Stout,  A.  J.  Duncan  and  John  Wyckoff,  directors.  The  "Cranbury 
News"  appeared  in  1882,  the  first  journal  published  in  the  town.  For 
nearly  thirty-six  years  George  W.  Burroughs  has  published  the  "Cran- 
bury Press,"  furnishing  the  town  with  one  of  the  best  local  papers  in 
the  State. 

The  Brainerd  Cemetery,  which  includes  the  old  burying  ground, 
situated  at  the  rear  of  the  first  Presbyterian  church,  is  historically  a 
most  interesting  spot.  It  contains  the  graves  and  monuments  of  six 
pastors  of  the  church,  elders  and  deacons,  pioneer  settlers,  and  those 
who  have  given  their  lives  in  the  service  of  the  country.  The  Soldiers' 
Monument  contains  the  names  of  those  who  served  in  the  Civil  War 
from  the  townships  of  Cranbury,  Monroe  and  South  Brunswick,  as

CHAPTER  XXXII. 
THE   BOROUGHS    OF  MIDDLESEX    COUNTY. 

Borough  of  Metuchen — The  origin  of  the  name  has  long  been  defi- 
nitely settled.  The  Indians  of  New  Jersey  were  divided  among  twenty 
kings,  or  sachems,  of  whom  the  king  of  the  Raritans  was  the  greatest. 
His  domain  extended  all  along  the  valley  of  the  Raritan  river,  of  which 
this  locality  was  a  part.  It  is  said  that  the  name  Metuchen,  variously 
spelled,  is  appended  to  a  deed  of  land  among  the  papers  of  the  New 
Jersey  Historical  Society.  The  word  in  the  Indian  tongue  means  "the 
rolling  land,"  and  refers  to  the  undulating  character  of  the  country. 
It  is  common  tradition  that  a  chief  called  Metuchen  had  his  camp,  or 
village,  in  this  vicinity,  and  is  said  to  have  been  buried  on  the  farm 
formerly  owned  by  the  late  Lebbpus  Ayres. 

The  borough  is  situated  nearly  in  the  centre  of  Raritan  township, 
and  is  about  two  miles  square,  with  a  population  of  three  thousand. 
It  was  organized  in  1900,  with  William  R.  Thornall  as  the  first  mayor. 
His  successors  have  been  Alexander  C.  Litterst,  Richard  H.  Wilson, 
Samuel  H.  Clark,  Washington  Wilson,  Henry  B.  Johnson,  Jesse  Jack- 
son, Dr.  Alfred  L.  Ellis,  Thorfin  Tait,  and  the  present  incumbent,  who 
has  been  three  times  elected.    The  term  is  two  years. 

It  is  said  that  a  postoffice  was  first  established  in  Metuchen  in  1832, 
with  George  B.  Stelle  as  postmaster.  Ever  since  the  office  was  removed 
to  the  central  part  of  the  town  the  postmasters  have  been  the  following : 
R.  R.  Freeman,  Ezekiel  Merritt,  Freeman  Edgar,  Thomas  Van  Siclen, 
John  J.  Clarkson,  J.  E.  Van  Geisen,  Albert  Acken,  R.  O.  Arnold,  Charles 
Ayres,  Nathan  Robins,  Howard  Campbell,  Edward  Burroughs  and 
David  A.  Power,  the  present  incumbent. 

The  High  School,  a  handsome  brick  building,  erected  in  1908,  has 
all  the  modern  appliances  and  improvements  and  is  efficiently  con- 
ducted by  the  supervising  principal.  Prof.  Thomas  G.  Van  Kirk.  The 
Edgar  Memorial  Public  School  was  built  in  1916,  from  a  bequest  made 
by  the  late  Charles  S.  Edgar,  a  life-long  resident;  he  also  gave  to  the 
borough  land  for  a  public  park,  near  the  school.  The  following  con- 
stitute the  Board  of  Education:  Charles  A.  Prickitt,  president;  George 
E.  Kelly,  vice-president;  Stelle  Manning,  Mrs.  Susanna  Molineux,  Miss 
Harriet  Alden,  Charles  E.  Mundy,  Bernard  Wittnebert,  Ralph  B.  Annis 
and  N.  A.  Roray.    District  clerk,  O.  R.  Drews. 

The  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Metuchen,  formerly  known  as 
the  Second  Church  of  Woodbridge,  was  organized  in  or  before  1767, 
as  a  paper  is  on  record  referring  to  its  union  with  the  Woodbridge 
church  on  August  5th  of  that  year,  proving  that  it  had  before  that  an 


456  MIDDLESEX 

independent  existence.  Rev.  Dr.  Azel  Roe  was  settled  as  pastor  of  the 
Woodbridge  church  in  1763,  and  by  the  union  in  1767  became  the  co- 
pastor  of  the  two  churches,  the  Session  of  Woodbridge  serving  foV  both. 
The  church  was  regularly  incorporated  as  the  Second  Presbyterian 
Church  of  Woodbridge  in  1787  and  Benjamin  Manning,  John  Conger, 
Ebenezer  Ford,  Ellis  Ayres,  Timothy  Bloomfield,  and  John  and  Robert 
Ross  were  chosen  its  first  trustees.  It  is  probable  that  some  place  of 
worship  existed  on  a  part  of  the  land  selected  as  a  graveyard  by  the 
early  inhabitants,  and  there  is  an  impression  that  the  church  standing 
during  the  Revolution  was  the  second  building  upon  the  same  spot, 
the  former  structure  having  been  an  old  barn.  The  size  of  the  church 
was  about  36x24  feet,  had  a  shingle  exclosure,  was  unpainted  and  without 
a  steeple.  In  1792  it  was  enlarged  by  an  addition  of  fifteen  feet,  the 
bids  for  the  work  being  as  follows :  By  Mr.  Jonathan  Freeman — "Himself 
6  shillings  per  day;  one  hand  at  5  shillings,  one  at  4  shillings  and  six- 
pence and  an  apprentice  at  3  shillings  and  sixpence ;  and  asks  no  rum, 
or  other  spirits,  and  will  through  (throw)  in  as  much  work  as  any  other 
undertaker."  By  Mr.  Johile  Freeman — "For  himself  6  shillings  per  day, 
&amp;  3  journeymen  at  S  shillings  and  sixpence  per  day,  and  will  through 
(throw)  in  10  days  for  one  hand,  and  asks  no  spirits,  if  found  with  small 
beer."    Jonathan  secured  the  contract. 

The  union  of  two  churches  was  dissolved  on  May  16,  1793,  and  in 
the  following  year  Rev.  Henry  Cook  became  the  pastor  and  served  most 
acceptably  until  his  death  in  1824,  when  Rev.  Michael  Osborn  became 
pastor  for  three  years,  and  was  followed  by  Rev.  Holloway  W.  Hunt, 
of  Kingwood,  Hunterdon  county,  who  occupied  the  pulpit  for  eighteen 
years.  In  1829  he  married  Henrietta,  daughter  of  Ezra  Mundy,  of 
Metuchen.  His  son.  Dr.  Ezra  M.  Hunt,  was  one  of  the  most  talented 
and  useful  men  of  his  day.  He  was  a  physician  and  surgeon  in  the 
Union  army  during  the  Civil  War,  and  for  many  years  after  a  capable 
and  influential  ofificial  of  the  State  Board  of  Health.  In  1870  he  wrote 
an  accurate  and  comprehensive  history  of  the  town  and  vicinity. 

A  new  church  was  built  in  1836  and  enlarged  to  its  present  dimensions 
in  1856.  Rev.  Peter  H.  Burkhardt  was  pastor  from  1847  till  1850,  and 
was  followed  by  Rev.  Robert  J.  Finley,  who  remained  until  1857,  and 
was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Gardner  S.  Plumley,  who  resigned  in  1876. 
He  was  followed  by  Rev.  Dr.  James  Gilbert  Mason,  who  is  now  serving 
his  forty-third  year  as  pastor.  In  the  new  cemetery,  between  the  church 
and  parsonage,  may  be  found  many  names  recalling  the  Colonial  times, 
viz :  Fitz  Randolph,  Campbell,  Manning,  Crow,  Conger,  Freeman,  Edgar, 
Hampton,  Compton,  Martin,  Vanderhoven,  Tappen,  Thornall,  Ayres, 
Bloomfield,  Crowell,  Kelly,  Acken,  Mundy,  Hunt,  Thomas,  Clarkson, 
Payne  and  others. 

The  First  Reformed  Church  was  organized  December  27,  1857,  by 
about  forty  persons,  who  took  their  letters  from  the  Presbvterian  Church. 


BOROUGHS  OF  MIDDLESEX  COUNTY  457 

Smith  and  David  Bloomfield,  Albert  Edgar  and  David  Thomas  were 
chosen  as  Elders,  and  Martin  Compton,  William  F.  Manning,  Henry 
Weston  and  Charles  E.  Bloomfield  as  Deacons.  The  present  church  was 
erected  on  land  donated  by  David  Thomas,  and  dedicated  August  5, 
1858.  Rev.  J.  Bodine  Thompson  was  pastor  until  1866,  and  was  suc- 
ceeded by  Rev.  Nicholas  Bogert,  who  resigned  on  account  of  his  health 
in  1870,  and  was  followed  by  Rev.  E.  Lord,  who  served  till  1880.  Rev. 
James  Cruickshanks  and  several  others  have  since  been  pastors.  Rev. 
Frederick  Zimmerman  is  the  present  pastor. 

St.  Luke's  P.  E.  Church  was  erected  and  the  first  service  held  therein 
June  30,  1869.  Rev.  Dr.  Abercrombie,  of  St.  Paul's,  Rahway,  and  others, 
conducted  the  services  for  some  time,  and  it  was  mainly  through  the 
efforts  of  the  first  named  that  the  church  was  built.  The  first  vestry 
was  as  follows:  Nathan  Robins  and  Daniel  Garrison,  wardens;  Henry 
M.  Alden,  John  R.  Cooke,  Thomas  Smith,  J.  R.  Boyd,  Thomas  W.

The  Centenary  M.  E.  Church  was  founded  in  1866,  and  the  building 
completed  and  dedicated  in  1869,  the  following  signing  the  certificate 
of  incorporation :  Walter  and  Robert  Pettit,  Robert  Idell,  Isaac  M.  Whit- 
tier,  Henry  F.  Coon  and  Rev.  M.  Daly.  Rev.  I.  L.  Gilder  was  the 
first  pastor,  and  has  been  followed  by  Revs.  E.  G.  Thomas,  J.  J.  Reed, 
Edward  Wilson,  J.  H.  Manaton,  H.  M.  Simpson,  T.  H.  Oaks,  P.  G. 
Blight,  E.  M.  Garton,  Isaac  C.  Decker,  J.  R.  Adams  and  others.  In 
191 7  the  church  was  thoroughly  remodeled  and  improved,  and  presents 
a  very  attractive  appearance.    The  pastor  is  Rev.  F.  J.  McClement. 

St.  Francis'  R.  C.  Church  was  erected  in  1871,  mainly  through  the 
efforts  of  Revs.  M.  C.  Duggan  and  John  Rogers,  of  St.  Peter's  Church, 
New  Brunswick.  The  building  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  December,  1903, 
and  the  present  edifice  was  erected  and  dedicated  in  the  following  year. 
The  present  pastor  is  Rev.  Arthur  D.  Hassett.

Dunellen  Borough — The  borough,  about  one  and  one-half  miles  square, 
with  a  population  of  about  4,200,  is  situated  in  what  was  the  extreme 
northwesterly  part  of  Piscataway  township,  and  is  bounded  on  the  north 
by  the  city  of  Plainfield,  on  the  east  and  south  by  the  township  and  on 
the  west  by  the  Green  Brook.  The  origin  of  the  name  is  not  definitely 
known,  some  imagining  it  to  be  a  transposition  of  the  name  of  a  member 
of  one  of  its  oldest  families — Ellen  Dunn ;  but  the  more  probable  deriva- 
tion of  the  name  is  that  it  was  so-called  from  a  Dr.  Dunell,  of  New  York, 
who,  in  the  first  settlement  of  the  town,  owned  some  land  and  built 


BOROUGHS  OF  MIDDLESEX  COUNTY  459 

several  houses  upon  it.  It  is  a  neat,  progressive  town,  on  the  New 
Jersey  Central  railroad,  and  in  all  likelihood  will  have  a  rapid  growth. 
The  principal  industries  are  the  Hall  Printing  Press  Co.,  Levgars, 
Structural  Iron  Co.^  Ransome  Concrete  Machine  Company,  Herzog  &amp; 
Kramer,  shirt  waists,  and  a  candy  manufacturing  company.

that  is  being  enlarged  and  remodeled.  Mr.  Glenn  W.  Harris  is  the 
principal.  The  Lincoln  school  is  also  a  handsome  structure.  The  two 
combined  have  about  650  pupils,  of  whom  about  100  attend  the  Plain- 
field  high  school.  Mr.  W.  Burr  Mann  is  the  supervising  principal.  The 
Board  of  Education — Augustus  F.  Todd,  president ;  A.  J.  Hamley,  clerk, 
Paul  Carpenter,  Theodore  Day,  Mahlon  R.  Dayton,  Charles  A.  Coriell, 
Oscar  Runyon,  George  Cameron  and  Harvey  B.  Walters. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  church  was  erected  between  New  Market 
and  Dunellen  in  1866.  At  that  time  the  church  was  connected  with 
the  Plainfield  church,  Rev.  George  H.  Whitney,  pastor,  and  Rev.  Charles 
S.  Little,  assistant.  The  succeeding  pastors  were  Revs.  Theodore 
Frazee,  Henry  M.  Simpson,  Martin  Herr,  G.  W.  Gibson  and  J.  A.  Kings- 
bury, during  whose  pastorate  the  church  building  was  sold  to  the 
Episcopalians  and  a  new  one  built  in  Dunellen  in  1872.  Other  pastors 
have  been  Revs.  James  W.  Marshall,  Charles  S.  Woodruff,  Salmon  P. 
Jones,  Ambrose  Compton  and  the  present  incumbent,  M.  L.  Andariese. 

The  Presbyterian  church,  on  Dunellen  avenue,  was  completed  and 
dedicated  January  26,  1872,  Rev.  Merrill  N.  Hutchinson  being  the  pastor. 
He  resigned  the  following  year  and  was  followed  by  Rev.  Theodore  S.

The  Washington  M.  E.  Church,  the  congregation  of  which  had 
organized  in  1846,  was  built  in  1859  ^  replace  one  erected  about  nine 
years  before.  The  constituent  members  were  James  Peterson,  Henry 
Gordon,  George  Norman,  Peter  Smith,  Z.  Vandeventer,  Margaret  Nor- 
man and  others.  The  later  church  cost  $S,8oo,  of  which  Mrs.  Nancy 
Conklin,  a  prominent  member,  contributed  about  $2,800.  The  first 
church,  remodeled,  now  serves  as  a  parsonage.  The  first  Methodist 
meetings  were  held  in  the  old  district  school-house,  near  the  old  Baptist 
church.  Rev.  Charles  Downs  acting  as  pastor  in  1846.  Revs.  Samuel 
Jaquette  and  Stacy  Howland  came  later,  the  church  being  then  a  mis- 
sionary charge.  The  first  resident  pastor  was  Rev.  John  H.  Stockton. 
The  Beacon  Light  Sunday  school,  under  the  auspices  of  the  church, 
was  organized  in  1848  with  114  members.  Among  the  list  of  members 
are  the  old  names  of  Kleine,  Barkelew,  Peterson,  Serviss,  Morgan,  Gor- 
don, Bowne,  French,  Irons  and  others. 

The  Tabernacle  Baptist  Church  was  completed  in  1871,  the  lot  on 
Main  street  being  donated  by  Samuel  Whitehead.  The  members  present, 
who  signed  the  confession  of  faith  on  May  3rd,  when  the  dedication

and  Elizabeth  Heustis,  Ezekiel  and  Susan  Wade,  Mrs.  E.  Simmons,  Sarah 
Cox,  William  H.  and  Sarah  De  Voe,  Matilda  Wilmurt  and  Mary  Rue. 
In  1872  the  church  was  received  into  the  Central  Baptist  Convention. 
The  first  settled  pastor  was  Rev.  Matthew  Johnson.  In  1881  extensive 
alterations  and  improvements  were  made,  rendering  it  a  very  attractive 
edifice.    The  Sunday  school  is  of  equal  age  with  the  church. 

The  Church  of  the  Holy  Trinity  (Episcopal)  was  organized  in 
Sayreville,  opposite  Washington  village,  in  1866.  In  the  summer  of 
1876,  with  the  consent  of  the  ecclesiastical  authorities  and  all  others 
concerned,  the  edifice  was  taken  down  and  removed  to  Washington 
village,  Daniel  B.  Martin  donating  a  lot  upon  which  to  rebuild  it,  and 
defraying  the  expense  of  the  removal ;  he  also  had  the  building  enlarged 
and  improved,  and  contributed  liberally  toward  furnishing  it.  The  first 
service  in  it,  after  the  removal,  was  the  funeral  of  its  generous  benefactor. 
Mr.  Martin  was  in  many  respects  a  remarkable  man.  He  was  born  in 
Perth  Amboy  in  1813,  and  made  his  home  in  Washington  village  from

1842  to  the  time  of  his  death  in  1876.  In  1846,  through  the  influence 
of  Robert  L.  Stevens,  president  of  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  Railroad 
Company,  he  was  made  chief  engineer  of  the  United  States  steamer 
"Mississippi,"  and  saw  active  service  in  the  Mexican  War.  In  1850  he 
was  made  chief  engineer  of  the  "Pacific,"  of  the  Collins  line  of  Euro- 
pean steamers,  and  was  highly  complimented  and  rewarded  in  185 1 
for  aiding  materially  in  achieving  for  the  United  States  the  credit  for 
the  first  passage  between  Liverpool  and  New  York  in  less  than  ten 
days.  In  the  s%me  year  he  was  appointed  engineer-in-chief  of  the 
United  States  Navy,  and  served  four  years,  during  which  time  he 
patented  for  the  government  the  "hood"  boiler,  regarded  as  the  best 
ever  invented  for  steamboat  use.  During  the  Civil  War  he  was  selected 
by  the  Secretary  of  War  to  visit  England,  examine  the  ironclad  steamers 
and  report  upon  their  merits  and  adaptability  for  government  use.  After 
the  war  he  lived  a  retired  life,  but  always  took  a  deep  interest  in 
religious  and  educational  affairs,  and  rendered  valuable  service  and 
support  to  both  churches  and  schools.

Borough  of  Milltown — Milltown,  situated  on  Lawrence  brook,  and 
containing  about  two  miles  square,  was  created  a  borough  in  1897.  The 
area  composing  it  was  taken  almost  entirely  from  North  Brunswick 
township,  with  a  small  portion  of  East  Brunswick.'  It  is  about  three 
miles  from  New  Brunswick,  with  which  it  is  connected  by  the  trolley 
line  of  the  Public  Service  Company.  The  history  of  the  borough  is 
brief,  and  is  practically  that  of  North  Brunswick.  Its  nurleus  was  the 
old  grist-mill  of  Jacob  I.  Bergen,  which  he  owned  in  1800,  and  vhich 
was  torn  down  in  1843,  when  the  utilization  of  the  water  powei;  by 
the  Meyer  Rubber  Company  was  commenced.  Mr.  Bergen  and  Chris- 
tian Van  Nortwick  were  the  first  merchants,  and  Jephtha  Cheeseman, 
John  Outcalt,  Robert  Watts  and  Daniel  Lott,  the  early  inn-keepers.  A 
postoffice  was  established  in  1870,  with  Philip  Kuhlthau  as  postmaster, 
who  retained  the  office  for  many  years.  In  1844  a  Methodist  flpiscopal 
church  was  organized  and  a  building  erected  in  1851,  which  was  removed 
in  1872  and  the  present  brick  house  of  worship  built  at  a  cost  of  $i4,i;oo. 
Rev.  Thomas  S.  Hammond  is  the  present  pastor.  There  is  also  a  Ger- 
man Reformed  and  a  Mission  (R.  C.)  church. 

The  borough  public  school  is  a  large  and  well-equipped  brick  build- 
ing, built  in  1907,  to  replace  a  former  structure.  There  are  520  pupils 
and  fourteen  teachers,  with  Prof.  Stephen  F.  Weston  as  supervising 
principal.  The  eighth  grade  is  taught  and  the  graduates  have  the  privi- 
lege of  Attending  the  New  Brunswick  High  School,  if  they  so  desire. 
The  following  constitute  the  Board  of  Education:  J.  Milton  Brindle, 
president;  Howard  S.  Dehart,  clerk;  Spencer  Perry,  Albert  Skewis, 
John  H.  Junker,  Lester  Snedeker,  Charles  Richter,  George  Heyland. 
Robert  A.  Patterson ;  John  Christ,  custodian. 

Milltown  no  doubt  holds  the  record  as  the  first  large  promoter  of 
the  manufacture  of  rubber  boots  and  shoes  in  this  country,  and  the 
credit  is  to  be  given  to  the  late  Christopher  Meyer.  He  was  born  in 
Hanover,  Germany,  in  i8i8,  and  came  to  this  country  in  1833.  He  was 
one  of  the  most  remarkable  men  that  ever  located  in  this  State.  In 
addition  to  the  manufacture  of  rubber  goods,  which  he  more  thoroughly 
understood  than  any  of  his  predecessors  in  this  country,  he  was  finan- 


BOROUGHS  OF  MIDDLESEX  COUNTY  465 

cially  interested  in  the  building  up  of  railroads,  factories  and  other 
branches  of  business.  In  1853  his  company  transported  machinery  to 
Edinburgh,  Scotland,  and  organized  the  North  British  Rubber  Company, 
of  which  he  was  a  stockholder  at  the  time  of  his  death.  He  located 
in  New  Brunswick  in  1839,  ^"^  in  1843,  i"  conjunction  with  Johnson 
Letson,  J.  C.  Ackerman,  John  R.  Ford  and  others,  of  New  Brunswick, 
began  the  manufacture  of  rubber  boots  and  shoes  on  the  site  of  Bergen's 
old  grist  mill  at  Milltown.  The  business  increased  rapidly,  large  build- 
ings were  erected,  five  or  six  hundred  employees  were  at  work,  and 
in  1861  the  Meyer  Rubber  Company,  with  $250,000  capital  stock,  was 
established  and  continued  in  existence  until  about  1896,  when  it  passed 
into  the  control  of  the  Rubber  Trust,  and  from  that  to  the  International 
Automobile  and  Vehicle  Tire  Company. 

In  1907  the  plant  was  purchased  by  the  Michelin  Tire  Company,  a 
French  corporation,  with  J.  Habette-Michelin,  of  New  Brunswick,  as 
resident  vice-president,  and  R.  B.  Meyers  as  industrial  manager.  New 
buildings  were  erected,  older  ones  enlarged  and  many  improvements 
introduced.  About  3,000  men,  women  and  young  people,  are  employed 
and  the  business  is  rapidly  increasing.  Other  industries  in  the  borough 
are  the  Hahn  Chemical  Works,  Unbreakable  Glass  Works,  and  the 
Russell  Playing  Card  Company. 

The  First  National  Bank  was  organized  January  15,  1917,  and  is  a 
member  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System.  The  following  are  the  officers : 
J.  V.  L.  Booraem,  president;  Christian  Kuhlthau  and  John  B.  Herbert,

Jamesbung  Borough — This  town  derives  its  name  from  James  Bucke- 
lew,  a  descendant  of  Frederick  Buckelew,  who,  on  account  of  religious 
persecution,  emigrated  from  Scotland  in  1715,  sailing  from  Inverness 
on  the  ship  "Caledonia,"  and  landing  at  Perth  Amboy.  He  soon  after 
selected  a  permanent  home  near  the  present  borough  lines,  where  a 
large  proportion  of  his  descendants  have  since  resided.  James  was 
born  August  13,  1801,  and  his  early  education  was  limited  to  the  ordi- 
nary instruction  at  a  country  school.  He  was  engaged  in  milling, 
farming  and  other  branches  of  business,  amassed  a  comfortable  fortune 
and  did  more  than  any  one  person  to  promote  the  growth  and  pros-

perity  of  his  native  town  and  its  vicinity.  He  died  May  30,  1869,  and 
was  buried  in  Fernwood  Cemetery,  the  land  which  forms  it  having  been 
donated  by  him,  and  which  was  once  owned  by  his  great-great-grand- 
father, the  pioneer. 

The  borough,  erected  in  1887,  has  a  population  of  2,052,  is  about  two 
miles  square,  and  located  on  the  Manalapan  river,  in  the  northeastern 
part  of  Monroe  township.  The  town  is  locally  alluded  to  as  Upper  and 
Lower  Jamesburg,  to  distinguish  the  two  extremities  of  the  borough. 
The  grist  mill,  saw  mill  and  fulling  mill  were  established  previous  to 
1792.  The  building  of  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  railroad  in  1830-33  was 
an  epoch  in  this  vicinity,  and  in  1850  the  road  was  straightened  and  the 
station  built  on  its  present  site.  When  in  January,  1872,  the  railroad, 
with  its  branches  from  Bordentown  to  Trenton  and  from  Jamesburg 
to  Monmouth  Junction,  was  leased  by  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  it 
was  constituted  the  Amboy  division,  and  Col.  Isaac  S.  Buckelew,  son 
of  James,  was  the  superintendent  until  the  time  of  his  death. 

In  i848_^Spotsv£Bad,^as  ihe„nearest  postofiiice  tojamesburg,  and  the 
maTTTervice  was  very  inadequate.  In  "that  year  "James  Redmond  was 
appointed  postmaster  at  Jamesburg,  and  was  succeeded  in  1853  by 
Joseph'  C.  Magee,  who  retained  the  ofiSce  for  nearly  fifteen  years.  Mr. 
C.  E.  Paxton  is  the  present  postmaster.  The  Manalapan  river  afifords 
an  excellent  water  power,  which  was  first  thoroughly  utilized  in  the 
latter  part  of  the  nineteenth  century.  Downs  &amp;  Finch,  of  New  York, 
did  an  immense  business  in  sbirtmaking  for  many  years,  commencing 
in  1871,  which  did  much  to  increase  the  growth  and  prosperity  of  the 
town.  The  Buckelew  saw  mill,  grist  mill  and  fulling  mill  were  also 
operated.  The  principal  industries  are  now  conducted  by  the  following 
proprietors:  Perrine  &amp;  Buckelew,  and  B.  D.  Davison,  lumber,  etc.; 
Stonaker  &amp;  Harvey,  mill,  grain,  etc. ;  Eastern  Foundry  Company,  James- 
burg Waist  and  Dress  Company,,  La  Rocco  &amp;  Son,  shirt-making,  and 
other  branches  of  business.  The  town  is  the  headquarters  of  the  Amboy 
division  of  the  Pennsylvania  railroad,  and  constitutes  an  important 
feature  of  the  borough's  business. 

The  first  school  house  in  the  Jamesburg  district  was  located  about 
a  half  mile  from  the  old  mill  on  the  Manalapan  river,  on  the  road  to 
Englishtown.  It  was  abandoned  in  1847,  and  a  two-story  brick  building 
was  erected  by  James  Buckelew  on  a  lot  owned  by  him,  near  the  site 
of  the  Presbyterian  church,  and  was  used  for  a  number  of  years  by 
the  district,  free  of  rent.  The  present  grammar  school  was  erected  in 
1886,  and  has  been  several  times  enlarged  and  improved.  An  up-to-date 
high  school  was  built  near  it  in  1907.  The  two  schools  have  now  705 
pupils,  of  which  104  are  in  the  latter.  Prof.  Curtis  A.  Deveney  is  super- 
vising principal.  The  Board  of  Education  is  composed  of  the  following : 
Dr.  J.  R.  Dare,  Jacob  E.  Hauser,  J.  M.  Hampton,  J.  A.  Thompson,  Dr.

Kirkpatrick. 

After  the  days  of  Brainerd,  the  missionary  to  the  Indians,  the  first 
religious  services  in  the  town  were  probably  held  very  early  in  1800 
in  the  old  school  house  in  Jamesburg,  and  there  were  also  meetings  in 
the  Matchaponix  neighborhood.  The  earliest  services  were  generally 
conducted  by  ministers  of  the  Methodist  church,  and  Rev.  Mr.  Fountain, 
living  near  "Texas,"  occasionally  preached  in  Jamesburg.  It  was  not 
long  before  Rev.  Mr.  Rice  and  Rev.  William  R.  Betts,  of  Spotswood,  the 
Woodhulls,  father  and  son.  Rev.  Luther  Van  Doren,  of  the  Tennent 
church,  Englishtown,  and  Revs.  Symmes  Henry  and  J.  W.  Blythe,  of 
Cranbury,  all  Presbyterians,  often  held  services.  When  the  second 
school  house  was  built  by  James  Buckelew  in  1847,  ^  room  was  parti- 
tioned off,  and  provided  with  a  pulpit  and  seats.  Revs.  Henry  and  Blythe 
conducted  occasional  services  until  the  spring  of  1850,  when  Rev.  George 
C.  Bush,  who  was  preaching  at  South  Amboy  and  South  River,  came 
regularly  to  preach  at  Jamesburg  every  alternate  Sabbath  evening.  He 
served  for  nine  months  and  was  followed  by  Rev.  John  Annin,  just 
graduated  from  Princeton  Seminary,  who  only  remained  for  three 
months,  after  which  the  meetings  were  intermittently  held. 

The  Presbyterian  church  had  its  inception  in  the  beginning  of  1853, 
when  a  petition  was  circulated  to  raise  funds  for  a  church  building,  and 
on  March  3rd  a  meeting  of  the  subscribers  was  held  and  William  John- 
son, Alexander  Redmond,  Aaron  Gulick,  Edmund  Rue,  Joseph  C.  Magee, 
Isaac  S.  Buckelew  and  S.  R.  Treeman  were  elected  trustees.  A  petition 
was  signed  by  seventeen  members  of  other  churches,  asking  the  Presby- 
tery of  New  Brunswick  to  organize  a  church.  A  committee  consisting 
of  Revs.  Messrs.  Symmes  Henry,  Blythe,  Van  Doren  and  S.  D.  Alex- 
ander met  January  6,  1854,  and  organized  the  church  with  the  following 
members:  John  C.  and  Hannah  Vandeveer,  Samuel  and  Ann  Maria 
Maryott,  James  and  Mahala  Mount,  Margaret  C.  Buckelew,  C.  J.  Apple- 
gate,  Sarah  Davison,  John  B.  Johnson  and  David  C.  Bastedo.  Messrs. 
Vandeveer  and  Johnson  were. chosen  Elders.  A  building  was  erected 
on  Church  street,  to  which  it  gave  its  name,  and  dedicated  June  26,  1854, 
.with  Rev.  J.  Halstead  Carroll  as  pastor.  He  was  succeeded  by  Revs. 
William  M.  Wells,  Dr.  Benjamin  S.  Everitt,  Joseph  C.  Ewing,  Edgar 
C.  Mason  and  S.  J.  McGlenaghan.  Rev.  William  J.  B.  Edgar,  for  twenty- 
one  years  pastor  of  the  First  United  Presbyterian  Church  of  Philadel- 
phia, succeeded  the  last  named  in  1914.  He  is  a  graduate  of  Princeton 
University  and  Seminary,  and  has  proved  a  most  successful  and  accepta- 
ble pastor. 

The  Methodist  church  was  organized  in  1874.  The  church  building 
was  erected  in  1883,  and  in  1907  was  moved  to  the  rear  of  the  lot,  con- 
verted into  a  Sabbath  school  room,  and  a  handsome  new  church  erected 


468  MIDDLESEX 

in  front  of  it.  Rev.  C.  Rollin  Smith  was  the  first  pastor.  Rev.  J.  B.  Shaw 
is  now  the  efficient  pastor. 

The  Baptist  church  is  ministered  to  by  Rev.  John  Ehrenstein,  and 
St.  James'  (R.  C.)  church  by  Rev.  Thomas  A.  Kearney. 

In  January,  1864,  James,  Isaac  S.,  John  D.  and  F.  Lemuel  Buckelew, 
Joseph  C.  Magee,  T.  Wilton  Hill,  John  G.  Schultz  and  Nathaniel  W. 
Morris  (who  were  the  first  directors),  secured  a  charter  for  a  national 
bank  at  Jamesburg,  being  the  two  hundred  and  eighty-eighth  institu- 
tion of  the  kind  to  be  charted  by  the  United  States  Government. 
The  following  are  the  officers  and  directors:  Joseph  M.  Perrine,  presi- 
dent; M.  I.  Voorhees,  vice-president  and  cashier;  William  H.  Brooks, 
assistant  cashier ;  Abij ah  Applegate,  William  H.  demons,  C.  M.  Davison,

Sayreville  Borough — Sayreville,  situated  in  the  northeastern  part  of 
the  county,  and  a  little  north  of  the  centre,  is  the  last  corporate  body  to 
derive  its  territory  from  South  Amboy,  and  is  bounded  as  follows: 
North  by  Raritan  river;  east  by  South  Amboy  and  Madison  township; 
south  by  Madison ;  and  west  by  East  Brunswick  township ;  and  is  very 
irregular  in  form.  South  River  flows  along  its  entire  western  border, 
Raritan  river  washes  its  northern  boundary,  Cheesequake  creek  flows 
along  the  east  side  to  its  junction  with  the  Raritan,  Deep  run  crosses 
the  extreme  southern  part,  and  Tenant's  creek  crosses  a  little  farther 
north.  The  area  is  1,240  acres.  The  surface  is  generally  low  and  level, 
and  covered  with  a  sparse  growth  of  trees,  the  oak  and  cedar  predomi- 
nating. The  soil  is  sandy,  and  abounds  in  excellent  clay  and  sand, 
much  of  which  was  early  employed  in  the  manufacture  of  delftware 
in  Jersey  City,  and  of  china  at  Philadelphia  and  Trenton.  Large  quan- 
tities are  now  used  locally  in  making  fire  and  common  building  brick. 
The  Camden  and  Amboy  railroad  traverses  the  locality  in  nearly  a 
northerly  and  southerly  course,  the  nearest  stations  being  South  Amboy 
and  Old  Bridge. 

Land  was  acquired  as  early  as  1683  to  1686  (the  date  of  John  Reid's 
map  of  Raritan  river  and  the  regions  north  and  south  of  it),  by  the 
following  persons:  G.  L.  (probably  Deputy-Governor  Gawen  Laurie,  a 
large  land  owner),  850  acres;  Peter  Sonman,  500  acres;  T.  Rudyard, 
300  acres;  A.  Galloway  and  W.  Gerard,  300  acres;  and  Thomas  Rob- 
inson, 300  acres.  At  a  point  considered  to  be  nearly  opposite  the  site 
of  South  River  borough,  D.  Violent  and  G.  Gordon  took  up  tracts 
respectively  of  100  and  150  acres,  and  R.  Townley  three  tracts,  contain- 
ing about  600  acres.  None  of  these  land  owners  were  ever  residents,  and 
none  of  their  descendants  are  known  to  have  ever  lived  in  this  vicinity. 

It  is  probable  that  the  first  settlement  was  made  about  1770,  when 
Elijah  Disbrow  located  about  midway  between  Sayreville  and  the  Wash- 
ington (South  River)  bridge;  and  also  in  the  neighborhood  known  as 
Burt's  creek  settlement.  Ebenezer  Price  selected  a  home  at  what  was 
known  as  Roundabout  Landing,  on  a  projecting  point  of  land  between 
the  Raritan  and  South  rivers.  Sayreville  was  formerly  known  as  Round- 
about, from  the  fact  that  it  was  accessible  by  water  only  by  a  very 
circuitous  route  by  way  of  the  two  rivers.  In  1872  it  was  renamed  in 
honor  of  James  R.  Sayre,  of  Newark,  an  extensive  land  owner  and  local 
manufacturer.  The  Disbrow  and  Price  families  have  many  representa- 
tives in  this  and  the  adjoining  townships. 

The  father  of  Gen.  James  Morgan  was  a  very  early  resident  near  the 
mouth  of  Cheesequake  creek,  and  many  of  his  descendants  continued 
to  reside  in  South  Amboy  until  a  comparatively  late  date.  Isaac  Van- 
deventer  lived  near  the  bridge  between  Sayreville  and  South  River 
borough,  purchased  a  large  farm,  became  a  very  prominent  man  and 


470  MIDDLESEX 

had  many  descendants.  Francis  Letts  resided  near  the  Elijah  Disbrow 
farm,  and  Benjamin  Peterson  came  from  New  Egypt,  Ocean  county, 
and  settled  near  by  in  1810.  Members  of  both  families  are  still  in  this 
county.  Other  old  residents  were  Thomas  James,  James  Applegate, 
the  Bennett  brothers,  from  Long  Island,  Thomas  Roberts  and  James 
Wood. 

Clay  and  sand,  and  the  manufacture  of  the  products  of  the  former, 
have  always  been  the  chief  industries.  Clay,  from  the  old  Morgan 
mines,  one  mile  south  of  South  Amboy,  on  the  shore  of  Raritan  Bay, 
was  used  in  making  stoneware  in  1800.  The  nearness  to  navigable 
waters,  the  plentiful  supply  of  clay  close  at  hand,  and  the  small  amount 
of  waste  material  to  be  removed,  combine  to  make  the  region  the  greatest 
brick-making  locality  in  the  country.  The  pioneer  in  this  business  was 
James  Wood,  who  began  the  manufacture  of  common  brick  in  185 1  on 
his  property  near  Roundabout  Landing. 

In  the  fall  of  1851,  James  R.  Sayre,  of  Newark,  and  Peter  Fisher,  of 
Fishkill,  New  York,  formed  a  copartnership,  purchased  a  tract  of  land 
on  South  river,  west  of  James  Wood's  brick-yard  and  began  making 
common  brick.  Mr.  Sayre  was  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling  lum- 
ber, common  and  fire-brick  and  other  building  materials,  and  Mr.  Fisher 
had  been  a  brick  manufacturer  in  his  native  town  for  several  years. 
The  local  supply  of  clay  having  been  apparently  exhausted  he  came 
to  New  Jersey,  seeking  a  new  location.  In  1861  the  firm  purchased  a 
large  tract  of  land  and  began  the  manufacture  of  fire-brick  and  other 
clay  products.  The  business  rapidly  increased,  and  the  company  is 
now  recognized  as  the  largest  plant  of  the  kind  in  the  United  States. 
The  daily  output  of  manufactured  material  is  as  follows:  Re-pressed 
common  brick,  355,000;  fire-brick,  36,000;  enamelled  brick,  22,000;  and 
hollow  brick,  60,000.  The  annual  output  of  common  brick  is  50,000,000. 
The  total  area  of  clay  land  is  three  thousand  acres.  The  manufacturing 
plant  covers  several  acres.  The  company  owns  five  and  one-half  miles 
frontage  on  the  Raritan  and  South  rivers  and  the  South  river  canal. 
The  number  of  men  annually  employed  is  1,700.  The  company  was 
incorporated  in  1886  as  the  Sayre  &amp;  Fisher  Company,  and  has  the 
following  officers:  President,  Edward  A.  Fisher;  vice-president  and 
treasurer,  James  S.  Higbie;  secretary,  F.  M.  Townley;  assistant  secre- 
tary, D.  J.  Fisher;  assistant  treasurer,  George  L.  Blew.  The  company 
absorbed  the  former  William  F.  Fisher  plant,  and  the  Wood,  Kearney, 
Roberts  and  Coleman  properties. 

The  Crossman  Company,  in  the  Burt's  creek  section  of  the  borough, 
are  the  largest  miners  and  shippers  of  clay  and  sand  in  the  locality.  They 
own  and  operate  an  extensive  tract,  use  all  the  latest  machinery  and 
appliances,  and  employ  a  very  large  number  of  men.  Whitehead 
Brothers  have  extensive  fire-clay  and  fire-sand  mines  along  the  road 


BOROUGHS  OF  MIDDLESEX  COUNTY  471 

from  Burt's  creek,  and  also  large  mines  of  moulding  and  building  sand 
and  kaolin  elsewhere  in  the  vicinity.  These  materials  have  a  rea'dy  and 
profitable  sale  to  manufacturers  of  brick,  founderies  and  builders.  The 
R.  J.  Such  Company  and  Otto  Ernst,  the  latter  at  Ernston,  mine  much 
clay  and  sand  and  have  large  tracts  of  land. 

The  Washington  Brick  Company,  adjoining  the  Sayre  &amp;  Fisher 
plant,  was  established  in  1868,  and  continued  in  business  until  the  death 
of  the  president,  Henry  F.  Worthington,  in  1879.  The  property  is  now 
owned  by  Edwin  Furman,  of  New  Brunswick.  Former  Sheriff  Edward 
F.  Roberts  mined  clay  and  manufactured  common  brick  on  the  Kearney 
tract  for  several  years;  but  abandoned  that  business  to  devote  his 
attention  to  the  mining  of  clay  and  sand. 

One  of  the  most  notable  industries  of  the  past  were  the  green- 
houses of  the  late  George  Such,  on  the  Ridgeway  property,  near  Burt's 
creek.  This  business  originated  from  a  small  greenhouse  built  by 
Mr.  Such  for  his  own  recreation  and  enjoyment,  and  with  no  idea  that 
it  would  eventually  become  a  business.  It  became  so  after  several  years 
and  offered  to  lovers  of  the  beautiful  in  floriculture  as  good  a  collection 
of  rare  and  fine  plants  as  could  be  found  in  the  country.  The  business 
extended  to  all  parts  of  the  Union,  and  also  to  foreign  lands,  many  of 
his  plants  surpassing  those  of  the  same  variety  grown  in  France  and 
England.    After  Mr.  Such's  death  the  business  was  abandoned. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  church  had  its  origin  in  the  old  Bethel 
circuit  in  1842.  In  1848  the  Sayreville  church  was  organized,  and  the 
church  erected  in  1872,  being  connected  with  the  South  River  church. 
The  union  was  dissolved  in  1874  and  Sayreville  became  a  separate  sta- 
tion. The  present  pastor  is  Rev.  J.  F.  Dolan.  There  are  two  other 
churches,  the  German  Presbyterian,  Rev.  Richard  Stier,  pastor,  and 
Our  Lady  of  Victory  (R.  C.)  church.  Rev.  William  A.  GiffiUan,  pastor. 
The  Holy  Trinty  chapel  (P.  E.),  was  erected  in  1861  and,  with  the  con- 
sent of  the  proper  authorities,  was  taken  down  and  rebuilt  in  South 
River  in  the  summer  of  1876. 

There  are  two  public  schools,  with  twelve  teachers  and  447  pupils. 
Another  school  existed  at  Ernston,  which  was  destroyed  by  the  explo- 
sion at  Morgan  on  October  4,  191 8.  Prof.  Jesse  Selover  is  the  supervis- 
ing principal  of  the  borough.  The  small  settlements  within  the  limits 
of  the  borough  are  known  as  Mechanicsville,  bordering  on  South 
Amboy,  Burt's  Creek,  Ernston,  Parlin,  where  the  Dupont  powder  works 
were  located  during  the  late  war,  and  Morgan.  At  the  last 
named  place  a  flourishing  settlement  has  grown  up  about  the 
mouth  of  Cheesequake  creek,  where  it  empties  into  Raritan  Bay,  and 
where  there  is  a  station  of  the  New  Jersey  Central  railroad. 
To  this  quiet  spot,  in  years  gone  by,  came  jurists,  lawyers,  artists, 
literary  and  business  men  to  seek  rest  and  relaxation,  and  amuse  them-

selves  by  fishing  in  the  bay,  and  hunting  in  the  forest  of  the  adjacent 
Morgan  estate.  The  old  inn,  now  called  the  "Old  Spey  Inn,"  was 
presided  over  by  Uncle  Charley  Applegate,  better  known  as  "Dad," 
and  many  amusing  tales  are  told  of  his  words  and  ways.  Many,  sum- 
mer cottages  have  been  built  by  devotees  of  the  rod  and  reel,  and  during 
the  season  the  place  presents  a  bright  and  lively  appearance.  An  excel- 
lent beach  affords  much  pleasure  to  the  lovers  of  bathing  and  swimming. 
Sayreville  township  was  created  in  1876  by  act  of  the  Legislature. 
The  first  chosen  freeholders  were  Elias  Rose  and  Richard  S.  Conover. 
Successors  to  them  have  been  George  Such,  James  Sweeney,  John  Hart 
and  James  Blew.  The  first  town  committee  was  William  E.  Dayton, 
Isaac  Walling,  James  R.  Morgan,  Stephen  Kelly  and  George  Such. 
The  borough  of  Sayreville  was  erected  on  January  ist  of  the  present 
year,  and  comprises  the  entire  territory  of  the  former  township.  The 
population  is  estimated  at  eight  thousand.  The  following  constitute 
the  borough  officers :  Mayor  and  acting  recorder,  John  J.  Quaid ;  council 
— Francis  Hartman,  president;  William  A.  Betzler,  Charles  J.  Engle- 
hardt,  Edwin  F.  Lockhart,  Carl  F.  Bossong  and  Edward  E.  Meeker; 
Joseph  J.  Webber,  clerk;  Abram  Feihle,  assessor;  Joseph  J.  Kupsch, 
collector  and  treasurer;  Thomas  H.  Hagerty,  counsel;  Board  of  Educa- 
tion— Abram  Feihle,  president ;  Frederick  S.  Davis,  district  clerk ;  Fran- 
cis Samsel,  Francis  Hartman,  Walter  Riddle,  Charles  Els,  Samuel  Dis- 
brow,  Benjamin  Boden  and  Eben  Rush;  Michael  Craven,  overseer  of 
the  poor ;  and  Thomas  F.  Dolan,  postmaster. 

Borough  of  Roosevelt — This  borough,  formerly  situated  in  the  extreme 
northeastern  part  of  the  township  of  Woodbridge,  was  erected  in  1906, 
and  contains  about  five  miles  square.  It  is  bounded  north  by  the  Rah- 
way  river ;  east  and  south  by  Staten  Island  Sound ;  and  west  by  Wood- 
bridge  township.  Originally  it  was  called  Carteret,  in  honor  of  the  first 
colonial  governor  of  the  Province,  and  was  so  recognized  by  the  gov- 
ernment when  establishing  the  first  postoffice,  and  the  office  continues 
to  be  so  designated  by  the  postal  authorities.  When  the  borough  was 
created,  the  name  of  Roosevelt  was  adopted.  In  Revolutionary  times 
Captain  Asher  Fitz  Randolph,  Peter  Noe,  Eliphalet  Moore,  Benjamin 
Brown  and  Robert  Burwell  (all  in  the  Continental  army),  resided  in  this 
locality;  and  in  later  years  well  known  residents  have  been  Ralph  M. 
Crowell,  Capt.  John  M.  Tufts,  Capt.  David  Tappen,  John  Wyckoff, 
Warren  and  George  Brown,  Miles  B.  Vernon,  Daniel  C.  and  William 
H.  Turner  and  James  Blair. 

The  history  of  the  borough  is  that  of  the  township  of  which  it  was 
a  part.  Its  proximity  to  navigable  waters  renders  it  desirable  for  trans- 
portation purposes,  and  the  Long  Branch  division  of  the  New  Jersey 
Central  railroad,  the  Public  Service  trolley  line,  the  Fast  Line  railway  to 
Newark,  and  the  ferry  to  Linoleumville,  Staten  Island,  afford  abundant

means  of  communication  with  the  outside  world.  The  growth  of  the 
borough  has  been  phenomenal,  the  two  sections  of  the  town,  locally 
known  as  Carteret  and  Chrome,  having  a  population  of  11,500.  The 
first  important  industry  was  established  in  1881,  when  the  Williams 
&amp;  Clark  Company  of  New  York  erected  a  factory  on  the  site  of  the 
present  plant  and  commenced  the  manufacture  of  fertilizers  from  fish. 
This  method  was  abandoned  after  one  or  two  years.  In  1890  the 
American  Agricultural  and  Chemical  Company  erected  the  Liebig 
Works,  and  ten  years  later  purchased  the  Williams  &amp;  Clark  factory, 
since  which  time  the  two  plants  have  been  conducted  under  the  same 
general  management.  About  400  men  are  employed  in  the  former,  and 
200  in  the  older  plant,  the  output  of  the  two  being  annually  $175,000 
tons  of  finished  fertilizers.  The  Armour  Company  and  the  Consumers' 
Company  (the  latter  a  branch  of  the  Virginia  and  Carolina  Chemical 
Company,  of  Richmond),  also  manufacture  fertilizers,  each  producing 
annually  about  50,000  tons. 

In  1888,  August  W.  Colwell,  of  New  York,  built  an  iron  works  which 
he  operated  for  about  ten  years.  It  was  acquired  by  the  Wheeler 
Condenser  and  Engineering  Company,  which  has  uninterruptedly  con- 
tinued business  from  that  time,  employing  a  large  number  of  men.  The 
officers  of  the  company  are :  J.  J.  Brown,  president  and  manager ;  H.  H. 
Brown,  vice-president;  A.  W.  P.  Cramer,  secretary;  Thomas  Bostock, 
treasurer ;  and  Roland  S.  Freeman,  superintendent.  About  1900,  Charles 
J.  and  Ferd.  E.  Canda,  of  New  York,  erected  a  plant  now  known  as  the 
Chrome  Steel  Works,  where  an  improved  and  superior  quality  of  steel 
is  produced;  Morro,  son  of  Ferd.  E.  Canda,  is  the  manager.  The  late 
Charles  J.  Canda  bought  a  large  tract  of  land  and  erected  many  dwell- 
ings. Much  of  the  land  is  still  owned  by  the  family.  The  United  States 
Metals  and  Refining  Company  is  the  successor  of  the  De  Lamar  Copper 
Works,  and  carries  on  the  same  business  as  its  predecessor,  with  a  large 
force  of  men.  Other  branches  of  business  are  the  Warner  Chemical 
Company,  phosphates  and  chemicals;  Carteret  Oil  and  Refining  Com- 
pany, Mexican  Petroleum  Company,  Klipstein  Dye  Works,  and  the 
Metal  and  Thermit  Corporation,  a  detinning  plant.  The  Bethlehem 
Steel  Corporation  owns  a  large  brick  building  and  a  tract  of  land,  and  is 
contemplating  the  establishment  of  a  manufacturing  plant  soon. 

There  are  two  large  and  excellently  conducted  public  schools,  with 
Miss  Barbara  V.  Hermann  as  supervising  principal,  and  Miss  Catharine 
Hermann,  principal  of  the  second  school.  The  two  schools  employ 
forty-two  teachers  in  the  regular  grades,  with  special  instructors  in 
music,  manual  training  and  drawing,  domestic  science  and  physical  train- 
ing; pupils  attending,  1,832.  The  following  are  the  principal  churches 
and  their  pastors :  Presbyterian,  Rev.  John  J.  Barsam ;  Methodist,  Rev. 
George  A.  Hill;  St.  Joseph's  (R.  C),  Rev.  John  O'Connor;  and  St.

Borotvgh  of  Spqtswood — This  borough,  created  April  15,  1908,  is  on 
the  southeast  border  of  East  Brunswick,  near  the  mouth  of  Machaponix 
creek,  and  is  a  station  on  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  branch  of  the  Pennsyl- 
vania railroad,  about  eleven  miles  south  of  Perth  Amboy.  Among  the 
earliest  residents,  of  whom  there  is  any  record,  were  David  Carnegie 
(Lord  Rosehill),  John  Lewis  Johnston,  James  Rue,  Samue!  Neitson, 
David  Stout,  Richard  Lott,  James  Abrams  and  James  and  John  Perrine, 
referred  to  in  the  charter  of  St.  Peter's  Church,  granted  November  23; 
^77%  by  William  Franklin,  the  last  royal  governor  of  New  Jersey,  as 
"all  freeholders  and  inhabitants  of  the  town  of  Spotswood,"  etc.  It  is 
the  general  belief  that  the  Johnston  above  mentioned,  of  the  ancier 
family  of  "Spottiswoode  in  Scotland,"  conferred  the  narne~ifrtl5norof 
his  ancestors,  as  he  was  the  owner  of  much  land  adjacent  to  the  present 
borough.  It  is  also  supposed  that  the  area  of  the  tract  known  as-SpotS; 
-wppd  in  1773  was  muchjarger  than  the  boundaries  of  the  former  village. 
Spotswood  owes  its  existence  to  the  water  power  there,  and  was  known 


476  MIDDLESEX 

as  a  manufacturing  point  since  its  earliest  history.  During  the  Revolu- 
tionary War  a  paper-mill  was  in  operation,  and  it  is  claimed  the  paper 
was  there  made  on  which  the  Continental  notes  were  printed. 

In  addition  to  the  above  names,  as  founders  of  St.  Peter's  Church, 
should  be  those  of  Frederick  Buckley,  John  Barclay,  Thomas  Newton 
and  John  Rue.  John  Lewis  Johnston's  father,  John,  lived  in  Perth 
Amboy  for  a  time,  and  was  largely  interested  in  property  there.  Land 
in  the  township  was  deeded  to  James  Rue  in  1785  by  Johannes  Van 
Leuwen,  of  Somerset  county,  and  Jeromus  Lott,  of  Kings  county.  New 
York.  It  is  supposed  that  Rue  came  from  Monmouth  county  at  a  much 
earlier  date.  Phineas  Mundy  was  prominent  as  a  property  owner  and 
business  man  in  the  early  eighties.  John  Bissett,  progenitor  of  the  large 
family  of  that  name,  settled  in  the  town  shortly  before  the  Revolution, 
and  spent  the  remainder  of  his  life  there. 

In  1759,  about  thirty  residents,  mainly  settlers  from  Staten  Island, 
built  St.  Peter's  Church,  the  first  service  being  held  by  Rev.  Mr.  Skinner, 
a  missionary  from  Perth  Amboy.  It  is  evident  that  services  were  held 
before  the  church  was  built,  as  Mr.  Skinner  wrote  a  friend  in  1847: 
"My  circuit  is  from  Amboy  to  South  River,  thence  to  Piscataway,  and 
thence  to  Perth  Amboy."  In  1802,  Rev.  John  Croes,  of  New  Brunswick, 
afterward  bishop,  became  the  rector  and  remained  seven  years,  when 
failing  health  induced  him  to  resign.  In  1850-1851  the  old  church  was 
^Jals^n  down  and  the  present  one  built. 

For  some  time  between  1800  and  1881,  Daniel,  Andrew  and  George 
Snowhill;  John,  William  and  Leonard  Appleby;  Isaac  and  Augustus 
De  Voe;  Phineas,  William  and  Lewis  Skinner,  John  and  William  Dill, 
William  Perrine,  John  Outcalt,  John  Browne  and  George  W.  Helme 
have  all  been  extensively  engaged  in  snuflf  manufacture.  Shirts,  hominy 
and  a  variety  of  other  articles  have  also  been  manufactured.  Of  late 
years  the  snuff  making  business  has  been  transferred  to  the  neighbor- 
ing borough  of  Helmetta. 

The  three  churches  are  St.  Peter's  Episcopal,  Methodist  Episcopal 
and  Reformed  Dutch.  The  first  named  is  very  old,  the  charter  having 
been  granted  by  King  George  III.,  of  England.  In  the  churchyard  are 
gravestones,  the  death  dates  on  some  being  as  early  as  1762.  Some  of 
the  names  are  Dorset,  Mears,  Reynolds,  Dennis,  Kinnan,  Herbert, 
Combs,  Lott,  Culver  and  Bissett.  The  church  is  the  second ^xj££jted_ 
upon  the  same  spot,  and  Rev.  William  L.  Phillips  is  the  rector.  The 
other  churches  have  not  settled  pastors. 

The  public  school  is  conducted  in  a  good  brick  building,  and  has 
about  185  pupils,  with  Miss  Anna  Fitts  as  principal. 

The  population  of  the  borough  is  about  700.  The  first  officers  were : 
Arthur  B.  Appleby,  mayor;  George  W.  Devoe,  clerk;  John  H.  Dill, 
collector ;  Thomas  J.  Browne,  assessor ;  William  J.  Bissett,  Augustus  A.

SUPPLEMENTAL  501 

KNIGHTS  OF  COLUMBUS,  WOODBRIDGE.— In  the  year  1904,  there  being 
councils  of  the  Knights  of  Columbus  in  New  Brunswick,  Perth  Amboy  and  South 
Amboy,  New  Jersey,  a  desire  to  establish  a  council  in  the  growing  town  of  Wood- 
bridge  was  thus  inspired.  Since  that  time  the  following  members  of  Gauncil  No.  857 
have  filled  the  chair  as  Grand  Knight:  J.  F.  Ryan,  J.  P.  Gerity,  R.  P.  Grace,  M.  R. 
Holohan,  Jacob  Grauson,  M.  F.  Conole,  Thomas  J.  Cody.  Middlesex  Council,  No. 
857,  was  instituted  March  13,  1904,  with  twenty-nine  charter  members,  as  follows:  Rev. 
J.  J.  GrifBn,  James  F.  Dunn,  Michael  R.  Holohan,  Michael  F.  Leahey,  M.  P.  Dunni- 
gan,  Richard  P.  Grace,  H.  F.  McCarthy,  James  P.  Hughes,  William  A.  Grace,  E.  L. 
Romond,  John  F.  Campion,  J.  H.  Concannon,  P.  J.  Kenna,  B.  A.  Dunnigan,  B.  J. 
Dunnigan,  Joseph  A.  Howell,  Patrick  Murtagh,  Michael  P.  Conole,  John  F.  Ryan, 
Louis  C.  Jelicks,  Patrick  J.  Ryan,  Arthur  J.  Delaney,  William  A.  Ryan,  Paul  P. 
Olbrick,  John  A.  Dunn,  Lawrence  C.  Ryan,  James  P.  Gerity,  Edward  J.  Mooney,  and 
D.  F.  Pender.  The  original  officers,  who  were  members  of  the  committee  of  organiza- 
tion, were:  John  F.  Ryan,  Grand  Knight;  J.  P.  Gerity,  Deputy  Grand  Knight;  Rich- 
ard P.  Grace,  Financial  Secretary;  D.  F.  Pender,  Recording  Secretary;  John  F.  Cam- 
pion, Treasurer;  E.  L.  Romond,  Chancellor;  Rev.  J.  J.  Griffin,  Chaplain.  From  its 
inception  this  council  began  to  take  a  deep  interest  in  social  and  civic  affairs,  and  its 
members  were  always  in  the  forefront  of  any  movement  that  was  for  the  betterment  and 
welfare  of  the  community.  This  organization  has  increased  its  membership  yearly, 
until  at  the  present  time  it  has  a  total  of  about  250,  and  is  increasing  rapidly. 

During  the  World  War  forty-five  members  of  the  council  were  in  the  uniform  of 
Uncle  Sam,  thirty  of  whom  saw  active  service  overseas,  and  one  of  our  brothers,  Cor- 
poral Edward  M.  Kelly,  made  the  supreme  sacrifice  for  his  country.  The  council  was 
always  active  in  the  Liberty  Loan  drives  and  other  war  work,  and  during  the  Morgan 
explosion  organized  a  local  Relief  Station  in  their  clubroom  on  Amboy  avenue,  and 
served  2,500  refugees  with  sandwiches,  coffee  and  milk.  The  council  also  assisted 
materially  in  the  great  epidemic  of  influenza  in  volunteering  their  services  to  the  com- 
mittee in  charge  of  the  Emergency  Hospital,  and  served  nightly  in  the  hospital  for 
several  weeks  until  the  danger  of  the  epidemic  had  subsided. 

In  1918  the  present  club  house  on  Amboy  avenue  near  Main  street  was  purchased 
and  fitted  up  as  a  modern  club.  It  soon  developed  that  these  quarters  were  inadequate 
for  the  housing  of  the  club,  and  a  committee  was  appointed  in  1920  to  look  up  larger 
quarters  with  the  result  that  the  spacious  home  of  Frank  Elias,  at  the  corner  of  Main 
street  and  St.  George  avenue,  was  purchased,  and  the  council  expects  to  move  into  its  new 
quarters  about  October  i,  1921.  In  connection  with  the  purchase  of  this  home  it  is  an 
interesting  historical  fact  to  note  that  the  new  site  was  the  location  of  Washington's 
Headquarters  during  Revolutionary  times  and  was  known  as  the  Cross  Keys  Inn. 

The  present  officers  of  the  council  are  as  follows:  M.  J.  Coll,  Grand  Knight; 
Joseph  J.  Grace,  Deputy  Grand  Knight;  Paul  P.  Olbrick,  Financial  Secretary;  Henry 
A.  Romond,  Treasurer;  Michael  R.  Holohan,  Warden;  Albert  J.  Thompson,  Chancel- 
lor;   Rev.  R.  J.  O'Farrell,  Chaplain. 

Besides  the  councils  above  mentioned,  there  are  now  (1921)  councils  in  Roosevelt 
and  Sayreville,  in  Middlesex  county. 


SEWAREN  HISTORY  CLUB.— In  the  year  1908,  at  Sewaren,  Middlesex  county, 
New  Jersey,  a  number  of  women  met  at  the  home  of  Mrs.  Frederic  Firman  Grant  (now 
Mrs.  William  H.  Tombs)  and  fonned  the  Sewaren  History  Club.  These  women, 
about  thirty  in  number,  elected  Miss  Mary  C.  Stoddart  their  first  president.  Mrs. 
Grant  (now  Mrs.  Tombs)  being  previously  inspired  with  an  idea  of  having  a  Memorial 
Library  in  memory  of  the  eminent  James  H.  Stoddart,  once  noted  actor  and  scholar, 
and  a  resident  for  many  years  at  Sewaren,  this  idea  was  incorporated  in  the  organiza- 
tion and  her  fondest  hopes  were  realized.  The  object  of  the  club  is  mental  and  social 
improvement  along  historical  and  philanthropic  lines,  and  the  general  culture  of  its 
members. 

In  these  early  days,  Mrs.  Hutchinson  as  treasurer,  Mrs.  Grant  as  secretary,  and 
Mrs.  Hufcut  as  historian,  gave  loyal  support  to  Miss  Stoddart,  who  presided  about  three 
years,  when  Mrs.  Grant  was  elected  president.  In  1913  the  Club  joined  the  State  Fed- 
eration, and  in  1915  became  a  member  of  the  National  Federation.

In  1918  the  members  of  the  Club  honored  Mrs.  Grant  by  placing  her  name  on  the 
"Honor  Roll"  of  the  Founders'  Book  of  the  New  Jersey  State  Federation;  and  the 
following  year  planted  a  tree  in  her  honor  on  the  "Lincoln  Highway."  During  this 
regime  the  members  of  the  Club  made  many  pilgrimages  to  historical  points  of  inter- 
est, visiting  many  of  Washington's  Headquarters  in  New  Jersey  and  New  York  State, 
and  Valley  Forge,  and  the  battlefield  in  Gettysburg. 

Mrs.  Grant  held  office  from  1913  to  January,  1919,  when  she  resigned,  and  Miss 
Daisy  A.  Rush,  first  vice-president,  became  acting  president.  In  May,  1919,  Miss  Rush 
was  elected  president  and  held  that  office  until  1921.  During  the  World  War  under  this 
regime  the  membership  increased  fifty  per  cent.,  and  great  credit  should  be  given  to  the 
officers  and  members  for  their  activities  in  the  Qub  which  enabled  it  to  support  the 
various  campaigns  and  driyes. 

In  1914  a  committee  was  formed  for  a  permanent  scholarship  at  the  New  Jersey 
College  for  Women,  at  New  Brunswick,  which  institution  is  now  fully  established. 

The  History  Club  has  other  affiliations,  namely — its  unit  membership  in  the 
Women's  Branch  of  the  New  Jersey  Historical  Society,  also  membership  in  the  National 
Security  League  and  the  Roosevelt  Memorial  Association.  The  Club  has  a  stone  in 
the  Washington  Memorial  at  Valley  Forge  and  in  the  National  Cathedral  at  Washing- 
ton. Its  Memorial .  Library  possesses  a  three-inch  bronze  medallion  of  Theodore 
Roosevelt. 

The  Club  has  a  department  of  literature,  art,  music,  civics,  scholarship,  legislature 
library,  drama,  and  others. 

In  May,  1921,  Mrs.  William  H.  Tombs  again  became  president. 

The  Club's  activities  have  had  a  general  influence  on  the  welfare  of  the  community, 
and  have  gone  hand  in  hand  with  every  movement  since  its  inception  by  its  moral  and 
monetary  support  whenever  a  worthy  cause  presented  itself.  It  has  sustained  itself  in 
all  these  fields  of  activity,  and  it  is  ranked  among  the  leading  women's  organizations 
of  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  The  social  part  of  its  work  has  meant  much  for  the  pro- 
motion of  culture  in  this  section.

BIOGRAPHICAL 

JOHN  P.  WALL.— The  name  Wall  is  a  corruption  of  De  Val,  and 
it  was  introduced  into  Ireland  by  the  Normans  in  1169.  The  bearers  of 
this  name  settled  in  the  South  of  Ireland  and  held  estates  in  Waterford 
and  Cork.  The  family  seat  was  in  Coolnamuck,  Waterford.  The  estates 
were  sold  in  1852  under  the  Encumbered  Estates  Act  and  are  now  held 
by  the  Ormond  Buttlers.  The  name  is  still  carried  in  the  original  form 
by  the  Spanish  and  French  descendants  of  the  family.  In  some  cases 
it  is  written  Del  Val,  notably  in  that  of  the  Spanish  family  of  Cardinal 
Merry  del  Val,  secretary  to  the  late  Pope  Pius  X.,  and  his  brother, 
Senor  Alfonso  del  Val,  the  present  Spanish  Ambassador  to  London. 
They  are  descended  from  the  Waterford  family  of  Wall,  and  this 
eventually  was  Latinized  into  its  present  form.  The  Ambassador's 
father,  Don  Rafael  Merry  del  Val,  was  for  some  years  secretary  to  the 
Spanish  Embassy  in  London.  Other  notable  members  of  this  family 
were:  Colonel  Joseph  Wall,  Governor  of  Goree  in  Africa,  1779- 1792, 
son  of  Garrett  Wall ;  John  Wall,  a  physician,  who  contributed  to  the 
establishment  of  the  porcelain  manufactory  in  Worcester,  England. 
The  Walls  of  New  Jersey  are  all  descendants  of  this  family. 

The  name  was  introduced  into  Spain  by  Richard  Wall,  born  in 
Waterford,  Ireland,  1693,  died  in  Granada,  1778.  He  entered  the  Spanish 
navy  while  still  a  youth,  and  rose  to  the  rank  of  major-general.  He 
served  as  private  agent  of  Spain  in  Aix  La  Chapelle;  was  Minister  to 
the  Court  of  St.  James,  and  later  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  Ferdi- 
nand VI.  and  Charles  III.  It  is  to  his  antiquarian  zeal  that  the  world 
is  indebted  for  the  preservation  of  the  Alhambra.  His  father  was  a 
colonel  in  the  army  of  James  II.,  and  had  two  brothers,  one  of  them 
being  the  father  of  Garret  Wall,  of  further  mention. 

Garret  Wall  was  born  in  1710,  and  died  in  1768.    He  married 

Cleary,  who  died  in  1779.    Their  son,  James,  is  of  further  mention. 

James  Wall  was  born  in  1764,  and, died  in  1806.  He  was  an  officer 
of  the  United  Irishmen,  and  very  active  in  the  stirring  days  of  1798.  He 
was  somewhat  of  a  political  figure  in  his  time,  and  his  services  were 
much  in  demand  as  an  orator.  He  married,  in  1794,  Mary  Brouders, 
born  in  1769,  died  in  1809.  Children :  Patrick,  of  further  mention ;  Gar- 
ret, born  1799,  died  1842;  Ellen,  bom  1801,  died  1851;  William,  born 
180S,  died  1869. 

Patrick  Wall  was  born  in  1796.  He  was  a  contraictor  for  army  cloth- 
ing in  London  during  the  Crimean  War.  He  returned  to  Ireland,  where 
he  died  in  the  year  1879,  and  was  buried  in  the  family  plot  in  Glanworth. 
He  married,  1825,  Hanora  Keleher,  born  1797,  died  1881,  daughter  o'f 
Michael  and  Mary  (Birmingham)  Keleher,  who  were  married  in  1796. 
Michael  Keleher  was  born  in  1768,  and  died  in  1841 ;  his  wife  was  born 
in  1770,  and  died  in  1800.  Children  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Wall:  i.  Mary, 
born  1826,  died  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  1904;  married,  1853,

REV.  WILLIAM  HENRY  STEELE  DEMAREST,  D.  D.,  was 

born  in  Hudson,  New  York,  May  12,  1863.  He  is  the  son  of  the  Rev. 
David  D.  Demarest,  D.  D.,  LL.  D.,  for  thirty-three  years  Professor  of 
Pastoral  Theology  and  Sacret  Rhetoric  in  the  New  Brunswick  Theo- 
logical Seminary.  His  mother  was  Catharine  L.  Demarest,  daughter  of 
James  Schureman  Nevius,  Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  New  Jersey. 
President  Demarest  is  the  first  alumnus  of  Rutgers  College  to  become 
its  president.  Ancestrally,  his  connection  with  the  college  is  almost 
co-extensive  with  its  history.  He  has  himself  been  a  trustee  since  1899, 
and  was  secretary  of  the  board  from  1904  until  1906.  His  father  was 
a  trustee  of  the  college  from  1858  until  his  death,  in  1898,  and  secretary 
of  the  board  from  1866.  His  maternal  grandfather  was  a  trustee  from 
1825  until  1858,  and  secretary  from  1825  until  1830.  His  great-grand- 
father, the  Rev.  Henry  Polhemus,  was  trustee  from  1800  until  1816, 
and  his  great-great-grandfather,  the  Hon.  John  Schureman,  was  a  trustee 
from  1782  until  1795. 

The  boyhood  and  young  manhood  of  William  H.  S.  Demarest  were 
spent  in  New  Brunswick.  He  graduated  from  the  grammar  school  in 
1879,  and  from  the  college  as  the  first  honor  man  of  the  class  of  1883. 
After  teaching  in  the  grammar  school  for  two  years,  he  entered  the 
Theological  Seminary,  and  graduated  in  1888.  Being  licensed  to  preach 
by  the  Classis  of  New  Brunswick  and  ordained  by  the  Classis  of  Orange, 
he  had  successful  pastorates  in  the  Reformed  churches  of  Walden,  New 
York,  ( i888-ii?Q7),"  and  Catskill,  New  York,  (1897-1901).  The  General 
Synod  of  igoi  elected  him  Professor  of  Ecclesiastical  History  and 
Church  Government  in  the  New  Brunswick  Theological  Seminary.  He 
thus  returned  to  the  service  of  the  institution  to  which  his  father  gave 
the  best  years  of  his  life.  Dr.  Demarest  continued  in  his  professorship 
for  five  years.  During  the  last  of  these  years  he  was  also  acting  president 
of  Rutgers  College.  The  trustees  elected  him  president  of  the  college, 
February  8,  1906,  and  he  was  inaugurated,  June  20,  1906,  in  the  presence 
of  the  largest  assembly  of  alumni  and  friends  which  has  ever  attended 
a  college  function  at  New  Brunswick.  Rutgers  conferred  upon  him  the 
degree  of  Doctor  of  Divinity  in  1901,  and  the  University  of  New  York 
gave  the  same  degree  in  1916.  He  also  received  the  degree  of  LL.  D. 
from  Columbia  University  in  1910,  from  Union  College  in  191 1,  and  from 
the  University  of  Pittsburgh  in  1912.  In  1909  he  served  as  president 
of  the  General  Synod  of  the  Reformed  Church  in  America.

The  first  ten  years  of  President  Demarest's  administration  have  been 
marked  by  a  very  vigorous  life  in  the  old  college.  The  adjustment  of 
the  relations  with  the  State,  accomplished  before  the. end  of  Dr.  Scott  s 
administration,  has  borne  fruit  in  largely  increased  appropriations.  Ihe 
Neilson  Campus  which  adjoins  the  Queen's  Campus  became  the  property 
of  the  college  through  the  liberality  of  Mr.  James  Neilson,  of  New 
Brunswick.  Upon  it  two  large  buildings  have  been  erected,  the  Engi- 
neering building  and  the  Chemistry  building.  Several  smaller  pieces  of 
property,  including  five  residences  adjoining  the  Neilson  Campus,  have 
been  acquired  by  purchase,  so  that  nearly  all  the  property  between  the 
Queen's  Campus  and  the  Theological  Seminary  is  in  the  hands  of  the 
college.  Upon  part  of  this  a  new  dormitory  has  been  erected  at  a 
cost  of  about  $125,000,  by  the  late  John  Howard  Ford,  of  New  York 
City,  a  trustee  of  the  college.  A  large  extension  of  the  Robert  F.  Bal- 
lantine  Gymnasium,  which  contains  a  fully-equipped  swimming  pool, 
costing  more  than  $30,000,  has  been  erected,  Mrs.  Robert  F.  Ballantine 
giving  $27,000  for  this  purpose.  An  Entomology  building  has  also  been 
acquired.  The  college  has  enlarged  its  land  holdings  by  an  extensive 
tract  comprising  two  blocks  on  the  western  side  of  College  avenue,  and 
by  lots  on  George  street,  extending  from  the  Neilson  Athletic  Field  to 
the  New  Buccleuch  Park.  Upon  the  latter  four  residences  have  been 
erected,  which  are  occupied  as  dormitories  by  the  Rutgers  Preparatory 
School.  The  strip  of  land  between  George  street  and  the  canal,  and 
extending  westward  from  a  point  near  Seminary  place  nearly  to  the  end 
of  College  avenue,  has  become  college  property.  The  College  farm  has 
been  greatly  enlarged  so  that  it  now  includes  nearly  .350  acres  of  land. 
On  it  has  been  erected  a  handsome  Agricultural  building  by  a  State 
appropriation  of  $100,000.  The  Short  Course  building,  the  Poultry 
Administration  building,  greenhouses,  dairy  barn  and  other  buildings 
have  also  been  added. 

The  progress  along  educational  lines  in  these  ten  years  has  not 
fallen  behind  that  along  property  lines.  The  faculty  has  increased 
considerably  in  numbers.  Short  courses  in  agriculture  during  the  winter 
months  and  a  summer  session  have  been  established.  The  number  of 
students  in  the  regular  courses  has  doubled.  Several  industrial  fellow- 
ships for  graduate  students  have  been  founded  and  new  lecture  courses 
inaugurated.  The  loyalty  of  the  Alumni  has  been  strengthened  by  the 
founding  of  several  new  local  Alumni  associations,  and  the  ancient 
interest  of  the  Reformed  church  in  the  college,  founded  by  its  ministers 
and  elders,  has  been  fostered.  The  outlook  for  Rutgers  was  never  before 
50  promising  as  in  the  year  of  its  one  hundred  and  fiftieth  anniversary. 


AUSTIN  SCOTT,  PH.  D.,  LL.  D.,  was  born  in  Maumee,  near 
Toledo,  Ohio,  August  10,  1848.  He  graduated  from  Yale  College  with 
the  degree  of  A.  B.,  in  1869.  After  a  year  of  post-graduate  study  at  the 
University  of  Michigan,  he  received  the  degree  of  A.  M.  He  then 
studied  three  years  at  the  universities  of  Berlin  and  Leipzig,  receiving 
his  Ph.  D.  from  the  latter  university  in  1873.     During  the  same  years

Voorhees  Professor  of  History  and  Political  Science,  Rutgers  College 


BIOGRAPHICAL  7 

he  was  engaged  with  Mr.  George  Bancroft  in  the  preparation  of  the 
tenth  volume  of  his  "History  of  the  United  States."  He  also  carried 
dispatches  to  General  Washington  which  contained  the  decision  of 
Emperor  William,  as  arbitrator,  between  Great  Britain  and  the  United 
States,  in  regard  to  the  northwestern  boundary.  Dr.  Scott  was  instructor 
in  German  at  the  University  of  Michigan  (1873-75).  He  collected  and 
arranged  materials  for  Bancroft's  "History  of  the  Constitution  of  the 
United  States"  (1875-82),  at  the  same  time  acting  as  associate  in  history 
at  Johns  Hopkins  University.  He  there  organized  a  seminar  of  American 
History,  and  conducted  it  from  1876  until  1882. 

In  1883  Dr.  Scott  was  made  Professor  of  History,  Political  Economy 
and  Constitutional  Law,  at  Rutgers.  On  November  25,  1890,  he  was 
elected  president  of  the  college,  and  was  inaugurated  February  4,  1891. 
He  conducted  its  affairs  with  great  ability  and  devotion  for  fifteen  years, 
until  January  i,  1906,  when  his  desire  to  devote  a  larger  part  of  his 
time  and  abilities  to  the  work  of  teaching  and  writing  led  him  to  relin- 
quish the  duties  of  the  executive.  During  his  administration,  the  Col- 
lege Extension  Department  was  organized  and  successfully  carried  on, 
the  teaching  of  the  English  Bible  was  introduced  into  the  curriculum, 
and  in  other  respects  the  educational  side  of  the  college  was  enlarged. 
On  the  property  side,  the  improvement  during  these  years  was  very 
marked.  Two  of  the  handsomest  college  buildings  were  erected.  Mr. 
Robert  F.  Ballantine,  of  Newark,  for  many  years  a  trustee  of  the 
college,  was  the  generous  donor  of  a  well-equipped  gymnasium,  and 
Mr.  Ralph  Voorhees  gave  the  college  a  new  library.  The  ground  for 
both  of  these  buildings  was  the  gift  of  Mr.  James  Neilson.  Van  Nest 
Hall  was  improved,  chiefly  by  the  liberality  of  Mrs.  Ann  Bussing,  of 
New  York.  The  house  adjoining  the  preparatory  school  was  purchased 
and  put  into  use  for  the  younger  scholars.  The  campus  was  also  greatly 
improved  and  beautified.  By  the  generosity  of  Mr.  James  Neilson,  the 
students  have  the  use  of  the  Neilson  Athletic  Field. 

It  was  from  Dr.  Scott's  initiative  that  the  Alumni  Endowment 
Fund  was  begun  in  the  first  year  of  his  administration,  a  fund  which 
not  only  promises  ever  increasing  advantage  to  the  college  treasury, 
but  which  binds  a  large  number  of  loyal  alumni  to  their  alma  mater. 
Large  additions  were  also  made  in  this  period  to  the  general  endow- 
ments' of  the  institution  by  the  liberality  of  Mr.  Robert  Schell,  Miss 
Helen  M.  Gould,  Mr.  Peter  Donald,  and  others.  By  no  means  the  least 
of  Dr.  Scott's  accomplishments  were  the  adjustment  of  the  long-stand- 
ing account  with  the  State,  and  the  passage  of  a  new  law  governing  the 
State  appropriations  to  the  college. 

Since  his  resignation  as  president,  in  1906,  Dr.  Scott  has  continued 
to  perform  the  duties  of  the  Voorhees  Professorship  of  History  and 
Political  Science  with  eminent  success.  The  degree  of  LL.  D.  was 
bestowed  upon  him  by  Princeton  in  1891,  and  by  Rutgers  in  1914. 


JOHN  HOWARD  RAVEN,  A.  M.,  D.  D.— The  active  work  of 
the  ministry  claimed  Dr.  Raven,  but  for  twenty-seven  years  he  has

logical  Seminary  of  the  Reformed  Church  in  America,  at  New  Bruns- 
wick, New  Jersey.  Dr.  Raven  ranks  high  as  a  theologian  and  has 
filled  and  is  still  filling  important  engagements.  He  is  a  son  of  Anton 
Adolph  and  Gertrude  (Oatman)  Raven,  his  father  bom  in  Curacao, 
the  largest  of  the  Dutch  West  India  Islands,  September  30,  1833, 
died  in  Caldwell,  New  Jersey,  January  15,  1919.  Anton  A.  Raven  was 
president  of  the  Atlantic  Insurance  Company,  of  New  York  City,  and 
a  man  of  influence  in  the  business  world.  He  married  Gertrude  Oatman, 
born  in  Cleveland,  Ohio,  January  15,  1840,  died  in  Brooklyn,  New  York, 
March  7,  1914. 

John  Howard  Raven  was  born  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  October  3, 
1870,  and  after  private  school  study  entered  the  Brooklyn  Polytechnic 
Institute,  finishing  with  the  class  of  1887.  He  spent  the  next  four  years 
at  Rutgers  College,  whence  he  was  graduated  A.  B.,  1891 ;  A.  M.,  1894. 
Choosing  the  profession  of  a  minister  of  the  gospel,  he  prepared  at 
the  Theological  Seminary  of  the  Reformed  Church  in  America,  at  New 
Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  there  completed  his  studies  in  Divinity, 
class  of  1894.  In  1899  Rutgers  College  conferred  the  honorary  degree, 
D.  D.,  and  in  1902-03  Dr.  Raven  pursued  special  courses  of  study  at 
the  University  of  Berlin.  He  was  licensed  to  preach  by  the  South 
Classis  of  Long  Island  of  the  Reformed  Church  in  America,  in  1894, 
and  the  same  year  was  ordained  by  the  Classis  of  New  Brunswick  pastor 
of  the  Reformed  church  at  Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  a  charge  he  faithfully 
fulfilled  for  five  years. 

During  the  years  1898-99  he  was  acting  professor  of  Old  Testa- 
ment Languages  and  and  Exegesis,  and  in  1899  he  resigned  his  pastorate 
and  has  since  most  ably  filled  the  same  chair  as  a  full  faculty  member. 
During  the  years  1910-13  he  was  lecturer  on  the  English  Bible  at 
Rutgers  College,  and  he  is  the  author  of  many  works,  including  the 
following:  "Old  Testament  Introduction,  General  and  Special,"  1906; 
"Essentials  of  Hebrew  Grammar,"  1908;  "Biblical  Hermeneutics,"  1910. 
He  is  also  the  compiler  of  a  "General  Catalogue  of  Rutgers  College,  1766- 
1916,"  having  previously,  1909,  completed  an  edition  of  same ;  and  "Bio-

EMIL  STREMLAU.— The  brightest  minds  and  the  most  gifted 
sons  of  the  nations  have  ever  been  called  into  the  circle  of  the  law, 
and  contact  with  other  minds,  equally  brilliant,  have  sharpened  the 
naturally  keen  intellect.  The  lawyer  of  ability  rises  above  the  ranks  of 
the  many,  and  attains  a  position  among  the  few  who  achieve  professional 
prominence.  A  position  of  this  kind  may  be  predicted  for  Emil  Stremlau, 
an  able  young  lawyer  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 

Charles  Stremlau,  father  of  Emil  Stremlau,  was  born  in  Alsace 
Lorraine  and  died  in  Meriden,  Connecticut,  at  the  age  of  fifty.  He 
came  to  America  with  his  wife,  Pauline  (Lange)  Stremlau,  and  settled 
in  Meriden.  They  were  the  parents  of  nine  children :  Hulda,  now  resid- 
ing in  New  York  City;  Edith,  wife  of  Frank  Koch,  of  Arlington,  New 
Jersey;  Julius,  a  director  of  prohibition  for  the  State  of  Connecticut, 
and  a  resident  of  Meriden ;  Charles,  a  cigar  manufacturer  of  Meriden ; 
William,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey;  Augusta,  wife  of  Henry 
Kreh ;  Fred,  chief  clerk,  in  the  freight  department  at  New  London,  Con- 
necticut; Emil,  the  subject  of  this  review;  Olga,  a  resident  of  New 
Haven,  Connecticut. 

Emil  Stremlau,  son  of  Charles  and  Pauline  (Lange)  Stremlau,  was 
born  in  Meriden,  Connecticut,  April  3,  1887.  He  was  educated  in  the 
Meriden  grammar  schools,  the .  Concordia  Preparatory  School  from 
which  he  was  graduated  in  1901,  Yale  Law  School,  and  New  York  Law 
School,  from  which  latter  institution  he  received  his  degree  of  Bachelor 
of  Laws  in  1908.  He  was  admitted  to  practice  law  at  the  State  bar  of 
New  Jersey  in  1909,  and  opened  an  office  in  Arlington,  New  Jersey,  in 
1909,  two  years  later  establishing  himself  in  the  practice  of  his  profes- 
sion at  his  present  location  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  In  the  pre- 
sentation of  a  case  Mr.  Stremlau's  manner  and  language,  being  quiet  and 
yet  forceful,  are  singularly  effective.  The  papers  which  he  prepares  are 
exceptionally  strong  and  present  the  matter  under  consideration  in  a 
manner  which  admits  no  dispute.  He  has  a  comprehensive  grasp  of 
all  questions  that  come  before  him,  and  is  particularly  fitted  for  his 
chosen  work. 

As  a  citizen  with  high  ideas  of  good  government,  Mr.  Stremlau 
stands  in  the  front  rank.  Always  a  staunch  Republican,  he  has  never 
been  conspicuously  associated  with  the  affairs  of  the  organization, 
though  taking  a  keen  and  helpful  interest  in  every  project  having  for 
its  end  the  betterment  of  conditions  in  his  community.  During  the 
World  War  he  was  secretary  of  the  legal  advisory  board  of  Perth 
Amboy,  and  in  August,  1919,  he  enlisted  in  the  United  States  army, 
and  was  stationed  at  Camp  Taylor,  Kentucky.  He  is  a  member  of 
the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  Royal  Arch  Chapter,  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  and  the  Fraternal  Order  of  Eagles.    Like 


10  MIDDLESEX 

many  busy  men  he  has  a  hobby,  which  is  out-door  sports,  he  being  par- 
ticularly .  fond  of  hunting  and  fishing,  and  in  order  to  satisfy  these 
desires  he  holds  membership  in  the  Raritan  Yacht  Club  and  the  Perth 
Amboy  Gun  Club.  Mr.  Stremlau  is  also  a  member  of  the  local  Young 
Men's  Christian  Association,  and  twice  a  week  he  attends  the  gymnasium 
connected  with  this  organization.     In  religious  belief  he  is  a  Lutheran. 

Mr.  Stremlau  married,  January  17,  1912,  Violet  Margaret  Cameron, 
a  daughter  of  John  Cameron,  chief  clerk  with  the  Trageser  Steel  Com- 
pany, and  Margaret  Cameron,  both  residents  of  Arlington,  New  Jersey. 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Stremlau  have  no  children. 

In  the  comparatively  short  space  of  eleven  years  Mr.  Stremlau  has 
advanced  himself  to  his  present  position.  That  the  much  longer  period 
that  is  yet  to  come  will  be  one  of  still  greater  achievement  there  can  be 
no  reasonable  doubt,  for  the  past  is  a  guarantee  for  the  future. 


MULFORD  DAY  VALENTINE.— The  history  of  the  M.  D.  Val- 
entine &amp;  Brother  Company  is  one  of  successful  business  management, 
the  enterprise,  executive  ability  and  strong  business  acumen  of  the 
members  of  the  company  achieving  a  wonderful  result  in  placing  the 
products  of  the  company  in  the  markets  of  the  United  States  and  at  the 
same  time  establishing  a  considerable  export  business.  Fire  brick  and 
drain  tile,  the  company's  chief  products,  were  given  a  new  importance 
in  the  business  world,  and  the  name  of  Valentine  became  widely  known. 
As  senior  member  of  the  firm,  Mulford  Day  Valentine  was  brought 
prominently  into  notice  and  became  known  as  a  capable  financier  and  a 
man  of  sterling  integrity. 

Mulford  Day  Valentine,  son  of  James  and  Catherine  (Ackerman) 
Valentine,  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  October  26,  1843, 
and  died  in  Syracuse,  New  York,  July  4,  191 1.  He  attended  school 
until  eighteen  years  of  age,  then  enlisted  in  the  Twenty-eighth  Regular 
New  Jersey  Volunteer  Infantry,  and  went  to  the  front.  He  enlisted  for 
a  term  of  nine  months,  but  he  was  not  mustered  out  of  the  service 
until  July  i;  1863,  his  record  one  of  soldierly  efficiency  and  hard  cam- 
.paigning  with  the  Army  of  the  Potomac.  The  army  service  was  followed 
by  a  course  of  training  at  Eastman's  Business  College,  Poughkeepsie, 
New  York,  preparatory  to  accepting  position  as  bookkeeper  with  the 
important  paper  house,  L.  T.  Valentine  &amp;  Company.  Two  years,  1864-66, 
were  spent  with  that  house  then,  deeming  the  time  opportune,  he  formed 
a  partnership  with  his  brother,  J.  R.  Valentine,  and  under  the  firm 
name,  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother,  he  established  the  manufacture  of 
clay  products. 

The  firm  at  first  made  a  commodity  now  unheard  of — bath  brick,  used 
for  cleaning  and  scouring  purposes.  This  product  later  became  an 
unprofitable  article  of  manufacture,  and  in  1867  M:  D.  Valentine  &amp; 
Brother  began  the  manufacture  of  drain  tile,  and  in  1868  added  in  a  small 
way  the  manufacture  of  fire  brick,  an  industry  they  developed  to  the 
highest  degree  of  productiveness.  The  company  owned  their  own  clay 
banks  and  operated  two  plants,  one  at  Woodbridge,  the  other  at  Valen- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  n 

tine  Station  in  Raritan  township,  Middlesex  county,  on  the  Lehigh 
Valley  Railroad.  A  large  force  of  men  were  employed  at  these  plants 
all  the  year  round,  and  their  output  was  shipped  to  all  parts  of  the 
United  States,  to  Cuba,  South  America  and  to  European  ports.  Year 
by  year  the  business  of  the  company  increased  and  Valentine  Brothers 
took  rank  among  the  foremost  fire  brick  manufacturers.  M.  D.  Valen- 
tine was  considered  an  authority  on  clay  and  clay  products,  and  his 
decisions  on  matters  affecting  the  clay  industry  carried  great  weight. 
The  firm  bore  an  unassailable  reputation  for  business  integrity  and 
reliability,  while  the  business  quality  and  executive  ability  of  both 
partners  won  them  the  respect  of  the  commercial  world  in  which  they 
moved.  M.  D.  Valentine  was  of  unusually  fine  business  quality,  saga- 
cious, energetic,  sound  of  judgment  and  clear  of  vision,  and  the  partner- 
ship, M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother,  which  existed  for  more  than  forty 
years  was  only  terminated  by  the  death  of  the  senior  partner,  Mulford 
Day  Valentine. 

A  Republican  in  politics,  Mr.  Valentine  was  offered  high  honors  by 
his  party,  but  steadfastly  declined,  although  his  voice  was  a  potent 
one  in  party  councils.  He  repeatedly  declined  the  nomination  for  State 
senator  and  congressman,  believing  he  could  best  serve  his  people  and 
their  interests  by  devoting  himself  to  his  business  which  meant  so  much 
to  a  large  number  of  employees,  while  as  a  worker  in  ranks  he  could 
serve  with  equal  value  to  his  party.  Though  retired  from  active  par- 
ticipation in  the  business  through  failing  health  for  a  year  prior  to  his 
passing,  he  was  not  confined  to  his  residence,  and  in  the  latter  part  of 
June  left  his  home  in  Woodbridge  to  visit  his  daughter,  Mrs.  Henry  W. 
Duguid,  of  Syracuse,  New  York,  and  at  her  home  he  was  suddenly 
stricken  and  passed  away. 

Mr.  Valentine  married,  September  3,  1867,  Rachel  V.  Camp,  of  Ocean 
county.  New  Jersey,  who  survives  him,  her  residence  at  No.  151  Green 
street,  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey.  The  only  daughter  of  Mulford  D. 
and  Rachel  V.  (Camp)  Valentine  is  Grace,  who  married  Henry  W. 
Duguid  and  has  a  daughter  Isabel.    An  only  son,  Eugene,  died  in  1877. 

This  brief  review  of  the  life  of  Mr.  Valentine  reveals  a  man  of  strong 
business  quality  and  deep,  earnest  nature.  In  disposition  he  was  genial 
and  kindly,  courteous  and  considerate,  a  man  who  made  many  friends 
and  always  retained  them.  He  was  buried  in  Alpine  Cemetery,  the 
funeral  services  being  held  from  his  home  in  Woodbridge,  the  services 
in  charge  of  Rev.  W.  C.  O'Donnell,  of  the  'Methodist  Episcopal  church, 
and  Rev.  George  Dougherty,  pastor  of  St.  Paul's  Church,  Newark,  a 
former  pastor  of  the  Woodbridge  church.  Thus  passed  a  valuable  man, 
well  worthy  of  the  high  esteem  in  which  he  was  held. 


GEORGE  COOPER  INGLING.— Since  the  inception  of  his  business 
career,  George  Cooper  Ingling  has  been  identified  with  the  newspaper 
business,  and  as  editor  of  the  "New  Brunswick  Times"  since  1915  he 
holds  a  recognized  place  among  the  representative  business  men  of  New 
Brunswick.     His  interest  in  all  that  concerns  the  community's  welfare 


12  MIDDLESEX 

is  deep  and  sincere,  and  wherever  substantial  aid  will  further  public 
progress  it  is  freely  given. 

George  Cooper  Ingling  was  born  in  Freehold,  New  Jersey,  April 
12,  1874,  the  son  of  the  late  William  Henry  and  Elizabeth  (Weeks) 
Ingling.  His  father  was  manager  for  Monmouth  County  Farmers' 
Exchange,  which  disposed  of  over  $1,000,000  worth  of  potatoes  and 
other  produce  for  Monmouth  county  farmers  in  eastern,  western  and 
southern  markets.  The  boy  George  attended  the  Freehold  Institute, 
from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1892,  when  he  immediately  became 
engaged  in  the  newspaper  business.  His  first  employment  was  with 
William  F.  Richardson  on  the  Monmouth  County  Press  Exchange,  which 
furnished  news  to  Monmouth  county  newspapers  and  to  the  New  York 
and  Philadelphia  daily  papers  from  Freehold,  the  county  seat  of  Mon- 
mouth county.  In  1896  he  secured  a  position  as  reporter  on  the  "New 
Brunswick  Times,"  which  was  being  issued  as  a  daily  paper  at  that 
time.  In  1916  it  became  the  "Sunday  Times."  In  191 5,  in  recognition 
of  the  ability  Mr.  Ingling  had  already  shown,  he  was  made  editor  of  the 
paper,  and  on  January  13,  1921,  he  completed  his  twenty-fifth  year  in 
the  service  of  one  paper. 

In  politics  Mr.  Ingling  is  independent  of  party  restriction  in  casting 
his  vote,  and  although  he  maintains  a  deep  interest  in  public  issues,  he 
keeps  strictly  aloof  from  political  circles.  He  affiliates  with  the  Young 
Men's  Christian  Association,  and  in  religion  is  a  Methodist,  attending 
St.  James'  Methodist  Church,  New  Brunswick,  where  he  has  served  as 
trustee,  president  of  the  Epworth  League,  and  superintendent  of  the 
Sunday  school.  Mr.  Ingling's  hobby  is  athletics,  and  until  war  inter- 
fered he  was  president  of  the  Inter-Church  Quoit  League,  which  was 
conducted  for  three  years  and  in  which  teams  from  ten  churches,  repre- 
senting men  over  twenty-five  and  those  under  that  age,  participated  in 
indoor  quoits. 

On  April  16,  1895,  Mr.  IngHng  was  united  in  marriage  with  Gertrude 
Frelinghuysen  Scott,  daughter  of  John  Charles  and  Gertrude  (Fisher) 
Scott,  both  deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Ingling  are  the  parents  of  three 
children :  George  Warren,  bom  February  26,  1896,  served  in  the  World 
War  with  the  311th  Machine  Gun  Battalion,  79th  Division,  in  St.  Mihiel 
and  the  Argonne  Forest  battles;  he  received  his  honorable  discharge 
from  the  service  in  1919;  Donald  Thurston,  born  March  10,  1898;  and 
Elizabeth  Cooper,  born  April  3,  1901. 


WILLIAM  STULTS  DEY.— Coming  to  South  Amboy  with  his 
parents  when  only  six  months  old,  William  Stults  Dey  has  lived  in  that 
city  all  his  life. 

Born  in  Cranbury,  New  Jersey,  July  22,  1869,  William  Stults  Dey  is 
the  son  of  Asa  and  Eliza  (Paterson)  Dey.  Asa  Dey  was  born  in  Cran- 
bury, New  Jersey,  in  1837,  but  in  his  young  manhood  he  came  to  South 
Amboy,  where  he  was  engaged  as  foreman  of  carpenters  at  the  Penn- 
sylvania Railroad  docks  at  South  Amboy,  being  occupied  in  this  work 
during  the  rest  of  his  life.     He  died  in  South  Amboy,  in  1905,  aged

son)  Dey  was  also  born  in  Cranbury,  but  died  in  South  Amboy  at  the 
age  of  sixty-five  years.  She  was  the  mother  of  four  children,  only  two 
of  whom  are  now  living :  Lewis,  a  resident  of  New  York  City,  connected 
with  the  New  York,  New  Haven  &amp;  Hartford  Railroad  as  foreman  of 
carpenters;  and  William  Stults,  of  further  mention., 

William  Stults  Dey  obtained  his  education  in  the  public  schools  of 
South  Amboy,  afterward  starting  upon  a  business  career.  When  eighteen 
years  of  age  he  entered  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad  shops  at  South 
Amboy  as  a  machinist's  apprentice,  and  after  learning  his  trade  still 
continued  in  the  employ  of  the  company.  After  spending  five  years  in 
their  service  he  was  transferred  to  the  cold  storage  department  at  South 
Amboy,  New  Jersey,  remaining  there  until  191 1,  at  which  time  he  became 
master  mechanic  of  the  New  York  &amp;  Long  Branch  Railroad,  a  position 
he  is  still  filling. 

Connected  with  various  interests  in  the  city,  Mr.  Dey  is  much 
interested  in  its  public  institutions ;  he  is  a  director  of  the  South  Amboy 
Trust  Company,  and  director  of  the  present  board  of  freeholders;  for 
seven  years  he  was  one  of  the  freeholders  of  Middlesex  county.  Mr. 
Dey  has  taken  a  very  active  part  in  the  conduct  of  city  affairs,  having 
represented  his  ward  in  the  Common  Council  for  six  years  and  after 
that  being  elected  mayor  of  the  city,  holding  the  office  for  two  terms  of 
two  years  each. 

Equally  active  in  fraternal  circles,  William  Stults  Dey  is  a  member 
of  the  local  lodge  of  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  having  been  master  of 
it  for  four  years;  he  is  also  affiliated  with  the  Independent  Order  of

CHARLES  CHAUNCEY  HOMMANN,  judge  of  the  District  Court 
of  Perth  Amboy,  lawyer,  business  man,  and  one  of  the  prominent  citizens 
of  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  was  born  at  Green  Bay,  Wisconsin, 
May  25,  1 85 1.  He  is  a  member  of  a  family  that  was  founded  in  the 
United  States  by  John  C.  Hommann,  who  came  to  this  country  from 
Saxony  and  settled  in  Philadelphia,  where  he  followed  the  profession  of 
music  teacher  for  a  number  of  years  and  eventually  died.  He  married  in 
London,  Constantia  Herbert,  and  among  their  children  was  William 
Hommann,  the  father  of  the  Mr.  Hommann  of  this  sketch.  William  Hom- 
mann was  a  clergyman  of  the  Episcopal  church  and  was  rector  of  the 
church  at  Green  Bay,  Wisconsin,  and  later  at  Newtown,  Pennsylvania. 


14  MIDDLESEX 

He  married  Fidelia  Smith,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  Charles  Chaun- 
cey  Hommann. 

Judge  Hommann  was  but  four  years  of  age  when  his  parents  removed 
to  Newtown,  Pennsylvania,  and  it  was  there  that  his  education  was 
received  at  the  local  public  schools.  As  he  grew  to  an  age  to  choose 
a  career,  the  young  man  took  up  the  study  of  civil  engineering,  and  fol- 
lowed that  profession  with  notable  success  until  1903.  In  the  mean- 
time, however,  he  had  also  made  a  study  of  the  law  and  was  admitted 
to  the  bar  of  New  Jersey  in  November,  1880.  For  a  number  of  years 
he  carried  on  both  professions  simultaneously  and  also  took  an  active 
part  in  public  affairs.  Since  1903  he  has  devoted  himself  to  the  prac- 
tice of  the  law,  a  profession  for  which  he  is  especially  fitted  by  his  natural 
talents  and  the  character  of  his  mind,  his  power  of  close  application  and 
hard  work,  no  less  than  his  fidelity  and  unswerving  loyalty  to  every 
trust.  Judge  Hommann  is  a  Democrat  in  politics  and  has  participated 
prominently  in  the  life  of  the  city  and  county  where  he  resides,  having 
held  a  number  of  responsible  offices  in  the  gift  of  his  fellow-citizens. 
He  was  elected  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Freeholders  in  1894,  and  has 
also  served  as  city  surveyor,  city  clerk,  superintendent  of  the  public 
schools  and  as  city  attorney.  It  was  in  the  year  1915  that  he  was 
elected  to  his  present  office  of  judge  of  the  District  Court  of  Perth 
Amboy,  a  post  in  which  he  has  added  greatly  to  the  reputation  already 
gained  by  him  in  his  legal  practice  as  a  learned  jurist  and  as  a  just  and 
impartial  man.  There  is  hardly  an  aspect  of  the  city's  life  in  which 
Judge  Hommann  is  not  conspicuous ;  he  is  associated  with  the  manage- 
ment of  the  Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company,  and  has  served  in  the  Essex 
Troop  of  Cavalry,  New  Jersey  National  Guard,  and  the  New  Jersey 
Militia  Reserve.  He  is  also  a  member  of  a  number  of  fraternal  orders 
and  clubs,  among  which  should  be  named,  the  Phi  Kappa  Sigma  fra- 
ternity; Raritan  Lodge,  Ancient  Free  and  Accepted  Masons;  Lodge 
No.  6,  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks;  the  New  Jersey  His- 
torical Society ;  the  New  Jersey  Society,  Sons  of  the  American  Revolu- 
tion ;  the  Colonial  Country  Club ;  the  Suburban  Golf  Club ;  the  Seniors 
Golf  Association;  the  East  Jersey  Club;  and  the  Raritan  Yacht  Club. 
Judge  Hommann  is  greatly  attached  to  all  forms  of  wholesome  outdoor 
sport  and  is,  especially,  an  enthusiastic  golfer,  devoting  much  of  his 
leisure  time  to  that  delightful  game.  In  his  religious  belief  Judge  Hom- 
mann is  an  Episcopalian  and  attends  with  the  members  of  his  family  the 
church  of  that  denomination  at  Perth  Amboy. 

Judge  Hommann  has  been  twice  married.  His  first  wife,  with  whom 
he  was  united  May,  1886,  was  Bessie  A.  E.  Elliott  Higgins,  a  daughter 
of  Gardner  Elliott  and  Ann  (Bryant)  Higgins,  her  death  occurring  in 
November,  1899.  He  married  (second)  Alice  Paterson  Boggs,  a  daugh- 
ter of  John  Lawrence  and  Cornelia  (Paterson)  Boggs.  One  son,  Charles 
Chauncey  Hommann,  Jr.,  born  April  17,  1887,  is  now  connected  with  the 
advertising  department  of  Collier's  Magazine.  He  married,  June,  1916, 
Elsie  C.  Smith,  of  Lee,  Massachusetts,  by  whom  he  has  had  one  child, 
a  daughter,  Constantia,  born  June  22,  1917.

JOHN  LAWRENCE  LUND,  M.  D— When  Dr.  Lund  faced  the 
problem  of  a  profession  or  a  business,  heredity  and  environment  were  all 
on  the  side  of  business,  and  for  a  few  years  his  attention  was  turned  in 
the  latter  direction,  but  finally  deciding  upon  the  profession  of  medicine 
for  his  life  work,  he  accordingly  made  the  necessary  preparation,  and 
as  an  obstetrician  has  attained  an  eminent  position  in  his  profession.  He 
is  one  of  the  successful  men  in  the  oldest  of  professions,  and  not  only 
has  he  gained  the  confidence  of  a  large  clientele,  but  he  has  won  the 
regard  of  his  brethren  of  the  profession,  who  accord  him  full  recognition. 

Niels  Lund,  father  of  John  Lawrence  Lund,  was  born  in  Ribe,  Den- 
mark, and  died  there  about  1894,  at  the  age  of  sixty-four  years.  In  1873 
he  came  to  this  country  with  his  wife  and  children,  and  settled  in  Brook- 
lyn, New  York,  where  he  remained  until  1894,  when  he  returned  to  his 
native  land,  where  his  death  occurred.  He  married  Katherine  Ihmes, 
and  they  were  the  parents  of  five  children:  John  Lawrence,  of  further 
mention ;  Otto,  a  violinist,  who  resides  in  Chicago ;  he  is  married,  but 
has  no  children ;  Harry,  deceased ;  Axel,  died  in  infancy ;  Arnold  E.,  with 
the  United  States  Cartridge  Works  of  Perth  Amboy. 

John  Lawrence  Lund  was  born  in  Ribe,  Denmark,  January  14,  1868, 
the  son  of  Niels  and  Katherine  (Ihmes)  Lund.  He  came  with  his  par- 
ents to  this  country  when  he  was  but  five  years  of  age,  and  settled  in 
Brooklyn,  New  York,  where  he  attended  the  public  schools.  After 
graduating  from  School  No.  12,  he  learned  his  father's  trade  of  painter  and 
decorator,  and  engaged  in  this  particular  line  of  work  for  four  years, 
at  the  end  of  which  time,  having  decided  upon  the  profession  of  medicine 
for  his  life  work,  he  entered  the  Long  Island  College  Hospital,  gradu- 
ating with  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine  in  1891,  and  then  for  one 
year  engaged  in  general  practice  in  Brooklyn.  In  1892,  equipped  with 
the  experience  gathered  first  in  hospital  work  and  then  in  independent 
effort,  and  also  having  passed  the  New  Jersey  State  Regents  examina- 
tion, he  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  where  he  has  since  engaged  in  active 
practice  of  his  profession,  with  offices  at  No.  267  High  street. 

During  the  World  War,  Dr.  Lund  volunteered  his  services  and  was 
commissioned  a  lieutenant  in  the  medical  corps  of  the  United  States 
army,  being  located  for  a  period  of  three  months  at  the  Medical  Officers' 
Training  Camp  at  Camp  Greenleaf,  Georgia.  He  was  later  promoted 
to  the  rank  of  captain  and  was  at  the  Base  Hospital  at  Camp  Sheridan, 
Alabama,  at  the  signing  of  the  armistice;  when  he  received  his  honorable 
discharge.  In  politics  Dr.  Lund  is  a  Democrat  and  takes  an  active  inter- 
est in  the  promotion  of  everything  which  he  deems  is  calculated  to  pro- 
mote the  welfare  of  the  community.  He  has  been  a  director  of  the  Perth 
Amboy  Savings  Bank  for  twelve  years.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Dana 
Society,  and  affiliates  with  the  Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows  and 
the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons. 

Dr.  Lund  married  Grace  L.  Thompson,  a  native  of  Perth  Amboy. 
They  have  no  children.  Dr.  Lund's  hobby  is  singing ;  he  has  an  excep- 
tionally fine  baritone  voice  and  for  many  years  was  president  of  the 
Choral  Society  of  Perth  Amboy.

Happily  gifted  in  manner,  disposition  and  taste,  enterprising  and 
original  in  ideas,  personally  liked  most  by  those  who  know  him  best,  and 
as  frank  in  declaring  his  principles  as  he  is  sincere  in  maintaining  them. 
Dr.  Lund's  career  has  been  rounded  with  success  and  marked  by  the 
appreciation  of  men  whose  good  opinion  is  best  worth  having. 


SAMUEL  MONEY  CHRISTIE  was  born  in  Hamilton,  Scotland, 
June  22,  1869,  the  son  of  Charles  and  Martha  (Money)  Christie.  Charles 
Christie  was  a  merchant  tailor  in  his  native  place  for  many  years,  and 
died  there  in  1895.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Christie  were  born  ten  children, 
seven  of  whom  are  still  living:  Elizabeth,  wife  of  Samuel  Forrest,  of 
Somerville,  New  Jersey ;  Jessie,  a  resident  of  Scotland ;  William,  a  resi- 
dent of  New  Haven,  Connecticut ;  Mary,  residing  in  Scotland ;  Peter,  a 
resident  of  Scotland;  Charles,  a  resident  of  Winnipeg,  Canada;  and 
Samuel  Money,  of  further  mention. 

The  education  of  Samuel  Money  Christie  was  obtained  in  the  public 
schools  of  his  native  place,  which  he  attended  until  he  was  thirteen  years 
of  age,  when  the  business  of  life  began  for  the  young  boy  and  he  served 
an  apprenticeship  to  the  printer's  trade.  He  worked  at  his  trade  for 
many  years  in  various  places,  and  in  1898  became  identified  with  the 
New  York  "Herald"  and  the  New  York  "Tribune,"  writing  for  these  and 
other  papers  for  a  period  of  twelve  years,  and  making  quite  a  reputation 
as  a  writer  of  humorous  verse.  In  1909  he  came  to  New  Brunswick  to 
take  the  position  of  general  manager  of  the  "Home  News."  One  year 
later  he  bought  the  "Evening  Times"  and  managed  this  until  1912.  In 
1916  he  took  over  the  Standard  Printing  Company,  since  which  time  he 
has  increased  its  capacity  more  than  ten  fold,  changing  the  name  three 
years  ago  to  the  Christie  Press.  In  1919,  he  started  the  South  River 
"Spokesman,"  which  he  edits.  Mr.  Christie  has  been  highly  successful 
in  his  venture  and  has  risen  to  a  place  of  prominence  among  the  business 
men  of  New  Brunswick.  His  success  is  in  every  sense  of  the  word 
self-made — the  result  of  his  own  indefatigable  effort  and  his  own  unfail- 
ing belief  in  his  right  to  succeed.  He  has  a  genius  for  politics  and  for 
public  service,  being  a  Democrat  in  his  affiliations. 

Mr.  Christie  is  regarded  as  the  ablest  publicity  man  in  political 
affairs  in  this  part  of  the  State,  and  has  never  been  identified  with  an 
unsuccessful  candidate.  Before  coming  to  New  Jersey,  Mr.  Christie 
conducted  political  campaigns  in  New  York  City,  and  in  this  State  he 
was  identified  with  the  original  campaigns  that  made  Woodrow  Wilson 
first  Governor  and  then  President,  and  also  with  the  campaigns  of 
Senator  "Billy"  Hughes  and  Congressman  Thomas  J.  Scully.  During 
the  years  1913-15  he  was  in  the  Interior  Department  of  the  National 
Government,  conducting  investigations  in  the  Indian  service.  In  that 
time  he  uncovered  more  inefficiency  and  corruption  than  all  other 
special  agents  in  the  service  put  together,  and  was  responsible  for  many 
changes  in  the  personnel.  When  he  found,  however,  that  that  sort  of 
zeal  was  not  appreciated  or  wanted,  he  quit  the  service  and  returned  to 
New  Brunswick.    The  Christie  Press  does  a  general  printing  business.

at  Nos.  11-13-15  Peace  street,  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey. 

Mr.  Christie  is  a  member  of  St.  Cecile  Lodge,  Free  and  Accepted 
Masons,  of  New  York  City,  and  Corinthian  Chapter,  also  of  New  York 
City,  the  original  matinee  lodge  and  chapter  in  the  world.  He  has  been 
active  in  church  work  and  is  a  member  of  the  Reformed  church  of  High- 
land Park,  New  Jersey,  and  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association. 
Mr.  Christie  finds  his  chief  recreation  in  playing  bridge  and  in  reading, 
being  especially  interested  in  fiction  and  historical  subjects. 

Mr.  Christie  was  united  in  marriage.  May  10,  1898,  with  Isabella 
Meickle,  a  daughter  of  Gavin  N.  Meickle,  born  in  Hamilton,  Scotland, 
now  residing  in  Jersey  City,  where  he  is  identified  with  the  Singer 
Manufacturing  Company,  and  of  Margaret  (Durie)  Meickle,  his  wife. 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Christie  are  the  parents  of  one  child,  Lorna  B.,  born  April 
29,  1899,  who  graduated  in  1921  from  Swarthmore  College,  Swarthmore, 
Pennsylvania. 


HENRY  BREWSTER  WILLIS.— Although  a  minister  of  the 
Gospel,  Rev.  Ralph  Willis  was  for  nineteen  years  superintendent  of 
public  instruction  for  the  county  of  Middlesex,  New  Jersey,  and  when  he 
laid  down  the  burdens  and  responsibilities  of  that  important  office,  they 
were  assumed  by  his  son,  Henry  Brewster  Willis,  the  present  incumbent. 
Five  children  of  Rev.  Ralph  Willis  followed  the  bend  of  the  paternal 
mind  and  embraced  pedagogy  as  a  profession,  three  of  them  yet  living 
and  prominent  educators:  Jane  V.  Willis,  of  Newark,  New  Jersey;  W. 
Spader  Willis,  principal  of  the  Newark  State  Normal  School ;  and  Henry 
B.  Willis,  superintendent  of  public, instruction,  Middlesex  county.  In 
addition  to  ripe  scholarship,  Mr.  Willis  brought  to  the  office  of  county 
superintendent  broad  experience  as  teacher  in  all  departments  of  public 
school  education,  from  the  little  district  school  in  the  county  to  the  pre- 
tentious city  high  school,  and  that  experience  was  part  of  a  perfect 
equipment  for  the  head  of  the  county  school  system. 

Henry  Brewster  Willis,  son  of  Rev.  Ralph  Willis,  was  born  in 
Albany,  New  York,  but  early  in  the  lad's  life  his  father  accepted  a 
call  to  a  pastorate  in  Monmouth  county.  New  Jersey,  and  in  that  State 
Henry  B.  Willis  was  educated  in  both  public  and  private  schools,  and 
later  was  graduated  from  the  State  Normal  School  at  Trenton.  He 
taught  school  for  several  years,  during  which  time  he  prepared  for  the 
practice  of  law,  and  in  1881  was  admitted  to  the  New  Jersey  bar 
as  an  attorney,  and  in  1884  as  a  counsellor.  He  began  the  practice  of  law 
in  the  county  in  which  he  has  long  served  as  superintendent  of  public 
schools.  While  engaged  in  the  practice  of  law,  he  was  appointed  a 
special  examiner  for  the  State ;  was  counsel  to  the  Board  of  Freeholders 
of  Middlesex  county  for  ten  years,  and  became  well  known  throughout 
the  State  as  a  specialist  in  school  law,  acting  as  adviser  to  many  boards 
of  education. 

After  his  choice  as  county  superintendent  of  schools,  the  rule  of  the 
State  Board  of  Education  went  into  effect  which  required  the  county 

Hid-2 


i8  MIDDLESEX 

superintendents  to  give  their  individual  time  to  the  office.  When  that 
ruling  was  made,  Mr.  Willis  unhesitatingly  chose  to  retain  the  superin- 
tendency,  though  his  practice  as  a  lawyer  was  much  the  more  remunera- 
tive of  the  two  professions.  Choosing  as  he  did,  under  the  circumstances, 
was  indicative  of  a  fine  sense  of  devotion  to  human  service  that  i.s  all 
too  rare  in  our  day;  and  yet  just  such  choosing  brings,  as  in  his  case, 
the  rich  reward  of  universal  esteem  which  far  more  than  compensates  for 
the  losses  of  a  material  nature.  Like  most  of  men  whose  highest  ideal 
is  that  of  service.  Superintendent  Willis  has  not  limited  his  field  of 
activity  to  the  narrow  confines  of  a  county.  Some  measure  of  his  capac- 
ity for  work  may  be  taken  from  a  partial  list  of  organizations  of  which 
he  is  still  a  working  member,  as  follows :  National  Educational  Associa- 
tion, of  which  he  was  both  a  director  and  vice-president ;  State  Teachers' 
Association,  of  which  he  was  president ;  State  Sanitary  Association,  also 
its  president ;  State  Council  of  Education ;  New  York  School  Masters' 
Association ;  and  the  Summer  School  Faculty  of  Rutgers  College,  holding 
official  position  in  the  three  last-named. 

As  an  organizer  of  forces  making  for  harmony  and  efficiency  in  all 
the  related  agencies  tending  to  the  development  of  the  educational 
possibilities  within  his  county,  Mr.  Willis'  record  is  truly  an  enviable 
one.  The  following  organizations  in  Middlesex — all  the  first  of  the  kind 
in  the  State — evidence  his  remarkable  talent  in  this  direction :  Middlesex 
County  Pedagogical  Library  Association,  which  was  organized  in  1895 
— this  organization  now  has  over  two  thousand  five  hundred  up-to-date 
books  on  pedagogy  in  its  library ;  Middlesex  County  School  Board  Asso- 
ciation, organized  in  1896;  District  Monthly  Conferences  in  1900;  Super- 
vising Principals'  Association  in  1902;  County  Medical  Inspectors' 
Association  in  1909,  and  the  Middlesex  County  Vocational  School  Board 
Work  in  1914.  At  the  1917  commencement  of  Rutgers  College  the 
trustees  conferred  on  Mr.  Willis  the  degree  of  Master  of  Arts.  In  con- 
ferring this  degree.  President  Demarest  said  it  was  in  recognition  of 
original  school  work  and  in  further  honor  of  thirty  years  of  successful 
superintendency  of  the  public  schools  in  Middlesex  county.  One  of  the 
unusual  and  noteworthy  facts  in  connection  with  the  above  organizations 
is  that  all  are  working  as  a  county  unit.  The  three  cities.  New  Bruns- 
wick, Perth  Amboy  and  South  Amboy  share  in  the  activities  of  all  these 
bodies,  and  their  educational  machinery  works  in  admirable  harmony 
with  that  in  operation  under  Mr.  Willis'  direct  supervision.  With  all 
these  available  forces  organized,  all  at  work,  and  intelligently  and 
enthusiastically  directed,  it  but  naturally  follows  that  the  schools  under 
the  supervision  of  Mr.  Willis  are  second  to  none  in  this  or  any  other 
State. 


JUDGE  WOODBRIDGE  STRONG.— Could  family  characteristics 
be  attributed  to  a  name,  the  temptation  would  be  irresistable  to  credit 
the  surname  Strong  with  the  strong  professional  eminence  of  Wood- 
bridge  and  his  ancestors,  from  the  coming  of  "Elder"  John  Strong,  the 
first  of  the  name  who  came  from  England  to  New  England  in  1630.  The 
line  of  descent  from  "Elder"  John  Strong  and  his  wife,  Rachel  Holton,  is

through  their  son,  "Justice"  Joseph  Strong,  and  his  wife,  Sarah  Allen; 
their  son.  Captain  Joseph  Strong,  and  his  wife,  Elizabeth  Strong;  their 
son.  Rev.  Joseph  Strong,  and  his  wife,  Jane  Gelston ;  their  son,  Rev. 
Joseph  (2)  Strong,  and  his  wife,  Sophia  Woodbridge;  their  son,  Pro- 
fessor Theodore  Strong,  and  his  wife,  Lucy  Dix ;  their  son,  Judge  Wood- 
bridge  Strong,  to  whose  memory  this  review  is  dedicated. 

Professor  Theodore  Strong  was  born  in  South  Hadley,  Massachu- 
setts, July  26,  1790,  died  at  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  February  i, 
1869.  At  graduation  from  Yale,  A.  B.,  1812,  he  took  the  first  prize  in 
mathematics;  was  professor  of  mathematics  and  natural  philosophy  at 
Hamilton  College,  1816-27,  and  filled  the  same  chairs  at  Rutgers  College, 
1827-1863,  and  knew  no  superior  as  a  mathematician.  For  thirty-six 
years  he  served  Rutgers  College,  as  a  member  of  the  faculty,  retiring 
at  the  age  of  seventy-three.  He  married,  September  23,  1818,  Lucy  Dix, 
of  Littleton,  Massachusetts. 

Woodbridge  Strong,  son  of  Professor  Theodore  and  Lucy  (Dix) 
Strong,  was  born  in  Clinton,  Oneida  county,  New  York,  (seat  of  Ham- 
ilton College),  February  21,  1827.  He  was  brought  by  his  parents  to 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  the  same  year,  and  died  there,  August 
23,  1907.  Originally  christened  Benjamin  Ruggles  Woodbridge  Strong, 
he  cut  the  name  in  the  middle  and  was  always  known  as  Woodbridge 
Strong.  He  entered  Rutgers  College  in  1847,  but  turned  from  classical 
to  professional  study  and  read  law  with  his  brother-in-law,  John  Van 
Dyke,  of  New  Brunswick,  afterward  a  justice  of  the  New  Jersey  Supreme 
Court.  He  caught  the  "gold  fever"  in  184)9,  journeyed  to  California, 
and  is  credited  with  being  among  the  pioneers  who  made  gold  discov- 
eries in  Oregon.  He  returned  to  New  Brunswick  in  1851,  resumed  the 
study  of  law,  and  in  1852  was  admitted  to  the  New  Jersey  bar  as  an 
attorney  and  in  November,  1872,  as  a  counsellor.  From  1874  to  1879, 
and  again  from  1896  to  1906,  he  served  Middlesex  county  as  judge  of  the 
Court  of  Common  Pleas.  He  was  an  eminent  lawyer,  a  learned,  just 
and  upright  judge,  holding  as  lawyer  and  as  jurist  the  highest  respect 
of  his  brethren  of  the  profession. 

Judge  Strong  married  Harriet  A.  Hartwell,  who  died  February  9, 
1909,  daughter  of  Jonathan  Hartwell,  of  Littleton,  Massachusetts,  a 
lineal  descendant  of  William  Hartwell,  who  settled  in  Concord,  Massa- 
chusetts, in  1636,  and  of  Anthony  Dix,  who  came  to  Plymouth  Colony 
in  1623.  Woodbridge  and  Harriet  A.  (Hartwell)  Strong  are  the  parents 
of  the  following  children:  Alan  H.,  a  lawyer;  Theodore,  a  lawyer; 
Edward  W.,  a  lawyer;  and  Elizabeth  B.  The  sons  studied  law  under 
their  honored  father,  and  all  became  eminent  in  the  profession. 


THEODORE  F.  RANDOLPH.— There  were  important  reforms 
inaugurated  in  New  Jersey  during  the  three  years  following  the  election 
of  Theodore  F.  Randolph  as  governor,  and  his  administration  has  been 
generally  commended.  He  is  a  native  son  of  Middlesex  county.  New 
jersey,  born  in  New  Brunswick,  June  24,  1826,  his  father,  James  F. 
Randolph,  editor  and  publisher  of  the  "Fredonian"  at  New  Brunswick 


20  MIDDLESEX 

for  thirty-six  years,  and  for  eight  years  a  Whig  representative  in  Con- 
gress. 

Theodore  F.  Randolph  was  liberally  educated,  read  law,  and  came  to 
the  bar  in  1848.  He  had  been  brought  up  by  his  father  in  the  Whig 
political  faith,  and  when  quite  young  was  writing  editorials  for  the 
"Fredonian."  When  a  young  man  he  went  to  Mississippi  for  a  season,' 
and  his  first  vote  was  cast  in  Vicksburg,  in  that  State,  in  1847.  After 
his  return  to  New  Jersey,  in  1850,  he  settled  in  Hudson  county,  where  in 
i860  he  was  a  member  of  the  State  Legislature.  In  1861  he  was 
elected  State  Senator,  an  office  he  held  four  years.  He  was  a  member 
of  the  special  committee  on  the  Peace  Conference  in  1861,  and  was  the 
author  of  the  measure  for  the  relief  of  the  families  of  soldiers  who  should 
serve  in  the  Union  army.  In  1867  he  was  elected  president  of  the  Morris 
&amp;  Essex  Railroad.  In  1868  he  was  the  candidate  of  the  Democratic  party 
for  governor  of  New  Jersey,  and  was  successful  over  his  Republican 
opponent,  John  I.  Blair,  by  four  thousand  six  hundred  and  eighteen 
votes.  He  served  with  highest  honor  for  three  years,  then,  as  no  gov- 
ernor of  New  Jersey  may  succeed  himself,  he  was  retired  to  private  life. 
But  in  1874,  the  Democrats  having  a  majority  in  both  houses  of  the 
New  Jersey  Legislature,  he  was  chosen  United  States  Senator.  He 
served  his  time  with  great  honor,  and  after  retiring  to  private  life  devoted 
himself  to  mining  and  farming  operations.  During  his  term  as  State 
Senator  he  introduced  a  bill  providing  fbr  a  State  comptroller.  During 
his  administration  as  governor  the  State  Riparian  Commission  was 
established,  the  Camden  &amp;  Amboy  monopoly  tax  was  repealed,  and  the 
Morris  Plains  lunatic  asylum  was  constructed.  On  July  12,  1871,  the 
anniversary  of  the  battle  of  the  Boyne,  he  issued  a  proclamation  insuring 
the  right  of  parade  to  the  Orangemen  of  New  Jersey  and  giving  them 
State  protection.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Democratic  National  Com- 
mittee, a  trustee  of  Rutgers  College,  and  a  founder  and  president  of  the 
Washington   Headquarters   Association,   of   Morristown,   New   Jersey. 

Governor  Randolph  married,  in  1851,  Fanny  F.,  daughter  of  N.  D. 
Colman,  of  Kentucky,  and  a  granddaughter  of  Chief  Justice  John  Mar- 
shall. He  resided  in  Morristown  from  1865  until  his  death,  November 
7,  1883. 


REV.  WILLIAM  WHITE  KNOX,  D.  D.— There  is  no  way  by 

which  the  value  of  a  life  to  a  community  can  be  estimated  and  especially 
is  this  true  of  the  life  of  the  minister  of  the  gospel.  Since  coming  to  the 
First  Presbyterian  Church,  of  New  Brunswick,  in  1893,  all  departments 
of  this  church,  of  which  Rev.  Knox  is  now  pastor  emeritus,  have  advanced 
to  a  large  degree,  but  these  are  but  the  tangible  evidences  of  the  value 
of  his  pastorate,  and  constitute  but  a  part  of  the  real  benefit  his  pure 
life  and  inspiring  leadership  have  meant  to  the  church  which  he  has 
served  so  long  and  devotedly.  The  spiritual  advancement  cannot  be 
measured  or  told,  and  the  great  record  alone  will  ever  reveal  what  the 
life  of  this  eloquent,  devoted  divine  has  meant  to  his  people  and  to 
the  community. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  21 

Rev.  John  Pray  Knox,  LL.  D.,  father  of  Rev.  William  White  Knox, 
was  born  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  the  son  of  Andrew  and  Rebecca  (Rice) 
Knox.  After  graduating  from  Rutgers  College,  in  1830,  he  matriculated 
at  New  Brunswick  Theological  Seminary,  graduating  in  the  class  of  1837. 
His  services  were  in  Reformed  Dutch  churches,  as  follows:  Nassau, 
New  York,  1838-41;  Utica,  New  York,  1841-44;  St.  Thomas,  West 
Indies,  1847-53,  and  at  the  end  of  this  time  he  was  called  to  the  Presby- 
terian church  of  Newtown  (now  Elmhurst),  Long  Island,  where  he 
filled  the  pulpit  for  twenty-seven  years.  Dr.  Knox  was  also  an  author 
of  considerable  note  and  wrote  a  history  of  the  Reformed  Church  of 
Nassau,  New  York,  of  the  Newtown  Presbyterian  Church,  and  also  a 
history  of  St.  Thomas,  West  Indies,  with  notices  of  St.  Croix  and  St. 
Johns.  Rev.  John  Pray  Knox  was  united  in  marriage  with  Aletta  Van 
Doren,  of  Somerville,  New  Jersey,  June  2,  1838,  and  the  union  was 
blessed  with  seven  children. 

William  White  Knox,  the  third  child,  was  born  December  14,  1842,  at 
Utica,  New  York.  At  the  age  of  nine,  he  entered  Rev.  E.  T.  Mack's 
School  at  New  Brunswick,  where  he  remained  for  two  years,  subsequently 
going  to  Fairchild's  Institute  at  Flushing,  Long  Island,  for  another 
two  years,  and  thence  to  William  Woodhull's  School  at  Freehold,  New 
Jersey,  thus  completing  his  preparation  for  Princeton  University,  whence 
he  was  graduated  in  the  class  of  1862,  with  the  degree  of  A.  B.,  receiv- 
ing from  this  same  institution  the  degree  of  Master  of  Arts  in  1865. 
From  1862  until  1863  he  taught  at  Hamill's  School,  Lawrenceville,  New 
Jersey,  and  then  took  the  regular  three-year  course  at  the  Theological 
.Seminary  at  Princeton,  graduating  in  1866,  and  was  ordained  a  clergy- 
man of  the  Presbyterian  church,  July  29,  1867,  by  the  Presbytery  of 
Nassau  at  Woodhaven,  Long  Island,  New  York,  and  was  at  the  same 
time  installed  pastor  of  Woodhaven  Presbyterian  Church.  He  also 
acted  as  supply  of  the  Presbyterian  church  at  Springfield,  Long  Island. 
In  1869  he  resigned  to  accept  a  call  to  the  Presbyterian  church  of  Hun- 
tington, Long  Island,  where  he  remained  until  December  4,  1881.  He 
then  accepted  a  call  from  the  First  Reformed  Church,  of  Bayonne,  New 
Jersey,  where  he  remained  until  September  17,  1893,  when,  after  a 
happy  and  successful  pastorate,  he  came  to  the  First  Presbyterian 
Church,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  served  until  July  29,  1917, 
the  fiftieth  anniversary  of  his  ordination  to  the  ministry,  when  he 
resigned  the  pastorate  and  was  made  pastor-emeritus.  Upon  coming  to 
this  parish  enthusiasm  gave  way  to  earnest  settled  purpose  and  mature 
judgment  which  rendered  him  valuable  in  counsel  and  leadership.  As 
an  eloquent,  pleasing  orator,  greatly  in  demand,  he  labored  abundantly 
in  behalf  of  the  church  at  large  and  safely  guided  his  own  church  to 
great  heights  of  Christian  usefulness.  Under  his  guidance  and  fostering 
care,  the  Magyar  Presbyterian  Church  of  New  Brunswick  was  estab- 
lished and  maintained,  and  the  Italian  Mission  on  Throop  avenue  was 
begun.  By  his  personal  influence  and  suggestion  Mr.  Anthony  Dey 
presented  Buccleuch  Park  to  the  city.  In  1894,  he  received  his  degree 
of  Doctor  of  Divinity  from  Rutgers  College;  in  1910  was  chosen  mod- 


22  MIDDLESEX 

erator  of  the  Synod  of  New  Jersey ;  and  is  a  trustee  of  Princeton  Theo- 
logical Seminary. 

Outside  of  his  church,  Dr.  Knox  was  affiliated  with  various  societies 
and  associations,  as  follows :  Phi  Beta  Kappa  Alpha  of  New  Jersey ; 
Scientific  Society  of  New  Jersey ;  Historical  Society  of  New  Jersey ;  the 
New  Jersey  Children's  Home  Society;  the  Ministerial  Associations  of 
New  York  and  New  Brunswick;  the  local  branch  of  the  Young  Men's 
Christian  Association ;  and  served  on  the  boards  of  several  local  charities. 

On  November  i6,  1870,  at  St.  Bartholomew's  Episcopal  Church,  of 
New  York  City,  Rev.  Dr.  Knox  was  united  in  marriage  with  Anna 
Maria  Van  Santvoord,  daughter  of  Cornelius  and  Susan  (Varick)  Van 
Santvoord,  the  former  a  lawyer  of  New  York  City,  the  latter  a  resident 
of  Jersey  City.  Dr.  and  Mrs.  Knox  are  the  parents  of  seven  children: 
Susan  Varick;  William  W.,  deceased;  Elizabeth  Vroom,  who  married 
Asher  Atkinson,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey ;  Anna  Romeyn ;  Kath- 
erine  Veghte,  deceased;  Evelyn  Van  Santvoord,  who  married  William 
Huntington  Russell,  of  New  Haven,  Connecticut;  Lieutenant  Cornelius 
Van  Santvoord,  who  married  Gladys  Channell,  of  Haverhill,  Massachu- 
setts. Residing  at  No.  175  Livingston  avenue,  New  Brunswick,  New 
Jersey,  Dr.  and  Mrs.  Knox  are  still  active  in  church  life  and  community 
service.  On  November  16,  1920,  it  was  their  pleasure,  with  family  and 
friends,  to  celebrate  their  golden  wedding. 


CHESTER  RIGGS  HOLMAN.— That  this  is  the  name  of  one  of 
those  members  of  the  New  Jersey  bar  who  are  rapidly  coming  to  the 
front  Mr.  Holman's  fellow-citizens  of  New  Brunswick  do  not  need  to 
be  told.  In  addition  to  his  increasing  professional  reputation,  he  has 
an  honorable  record  of  foreign  service  during  the  recent  World  War. 

Ralph  T.  Holman,  father  of  Chester  Riggs  Holman,  was  born  in 
New  Brunswick,  and  is  a  well  known  print  cutter.  He  was  formerly 
national  president  of  the  Print  Cutters'  Association  of  America ;  served 
New  Brunswick  as  a  Republican  member  of  Common  Council  for  a  period 
of  four  years ;  is  assistant  secretary  of  the  State  Firemen's  Relief  Asso- 
ciation, and  an  officer  in  a  number  of  local  lodges  and  clubs.  Mr.  Hol- 
man married  Ella  Dilts,  a  native  of  Quakertown,  Hunterdon  county. 
New  Jersey,  and  their  other  children  are:  Allen  P.  and  Florence  ,M., 
both  of  New  Brunswick. 

Chester  Riggs  Holman,  son  of  Ralph  T.  and  Ella  (Dilts)  Holman, 
was  born  May  10,  1892,  in  New  Brunswick,  and  in  1910  graduated  from

attorney  in  1914,  at  the  June  term  of  the  Supreme  Court,  and  as  coun- 
sellor at  the  November  term,  1920.  Immediately  thereafter,  Mr.  Holman 
began  practice  in  New  Brunswick,  having  his  office  in  the  National 
Bank  building.  During  the  next  few  years,  by  dint  of  indomitable 
energy,  thorough  knowledge  of  the  law,  and  strict  attention  to  the 
interests  of  his  clients,  he  made  for  himself  an  assured  standing  at  the 
bar  of  his  native  citv.

Soon,  however,  his  professional  career  suffered  an  interruption.  The 
United  States  entered  the  great  conflict  of  nations  and  it  was  not  long 
before  Mr.  Holman,  with  many  other  young  men  of  his  generation, 
exchanged  the  court  room  for  the  camp.  Enlisting  as  drafted,  February 
25,  1918,  he  was  assigned  to  Battery  B,  307th  Field  Artillery,  stationed 
at  Camp  Dix,  and  on  May  27,  1918,  sailed  for  France.  During  the 
period  of  his  service  there  he  participated  in  the  following  battles :  St. 
Mihiel  ofifensive;  Meuse-Argonne  offensive;  Toul  sector;  Preny  Raid 
offensive;  and  Grand  Pre  attack.  He  was  made  corporal  while  in  the 
Argonne,  and  had  received  instructions  to  report  to  officers'  training 
camp  when  the  armistice  was  signed.  While  in  France  he  had  charge 
of  gas  and  gas  offense  work.  On  May  22,  1919,  he  was  discharged  at 
Camp  Dix. 

On  June  14,  1919,  Mr.  Holman  resumed  the  active  practice  of  his 
profession  and  has  ever  since  been  continuously  engaged  in  adding  to 
the  enviable  reputation  which  he  had  begun  to  rear  on  a  sure  and  solid 
foundation.  The  principles  of  the  Republican  party  are  those  to  which 
Mr.  Holman  gives  his  political  allegiance,  and  he  is  now  serving  as  a 
member  of  the  Middlesex  County  Board  of  Election.  He  is  affiliated 
with  Union  Lodge,  No.  19,  Free  and  Accepted  Masons ;  New  Brunswick 
Forest,  No.  12,  Tall  Cedars  of  Lebanon;  Friendship  Lodge,  No.  30, 
Knights  of  Pythias;  Goodwill  Council,  No.  32,  Junior  Order  of  United 
American  Mechanics ;  New  Brunswick  Camp,  No.  40,  Sons  of  Veterans ; 
and  Charles  Henry  Post,  No.  29,  American  Legion.  His  clubs  are  the 
Craftsmen's  and  the  New  Brunswick  Boat.  He  is  a  member  of  the  First 
Presbyterian  Church. 

Mr.  Holman  married,  April  zy,  1918,  at  Flemington,  New  Jersey, 
Ruth  Cleveland  Vogel,  daughter  of  George  and  Mary  Vogel,  of  that 
place. 

Busy  man  though  he  is,  Mr.  Holman  has  far  too  much  wisdom  to 
believe  in  "all  work  and  no  play."  He  delights  in  canoeing  and  is  an 
ardent  football  fan.  He  has  proved  himself  a  good  citizen,  a  brave 
soldier,  and  an  able  lawyer,  and  everything  seems  to  indicate  that  the 
years  to  come  hold  for  him  professional  advancement.

BENJAMIN  FRANKLIN  HOWELL.— The  Howell  family  is  a  very 
old  one  in  the  United  States  and  one  that  has  always  been  well  known 
and  highly  respected.  In  nearly  every  war  in  which  this  country  has 
been  engaged,  the  family  has  been  represented,  some  one  of  them  hav- 
ing taken  a  creditable  part  in  the  struggle.  They  originally  came  from 
England,  settling  first  on  Long. Island,  and  later  on  a  portion  of  them 
migrated  to  New  Jersey,  where  the  homestead  was  built  in  Cumberland 
county.  The  line  of  descent  from  the  founder  of  the  branch  herein 
followed  is  through  William  Howell,  of  England;  Henry,  Edward, 
Major  John,  John,  John,  Charles,  Charles,  Elias,  Edmund,  Benjamin 
Franklin  Howell. 

Benjamin  Franklin  Howell  was  born  upon  his  father's  farm  in 
Cumberland  county.  New  Jersey,  January  27,  1844,  his  parents  being 
Edmund  and  Hannah  (Nixon)  Howell.  Edmund  Howell  spent  his  life  on 
the  homestead  farm  and  there  he  died  at  the  age  of  fifty-four,  his  wife 
surviving  him  by  a  few  years,  dying  in  Bridgeton,  New  Jersey,  when 
fifty-eight  years  old.  They  had  a  large  family,  four  of  whom  are  now 
living)  as  follows :  Mrs.  Ruth  N.  Cassedy,  of  Estes  Park,  Colorado ; 
Benjamin  Franklin,  of  further  mention;  Mrs.  Cornelia  B.  Simms,  also 
a  resident  of  Estes  Park,  Colorado ;  George  M.,  living  in  Kansas. 

Benjamin  Franklin  Howell  attended  the  village  school  at  Cedar\'ille, 
New  Jersey,  later  being  sent  to  Fort  Edward,  New  York,  to  finish  his 
education,  but  before  this  was  accomplished  the  Civil  War  broke  out  and 
he  enlisted  in  Company  K,  12th  New  Jersey  Volunteers,  and  served 
during  the  entire  war,  a  period  of  four  years,  and  was  mustered  out  in 
July,  1865.  Mr.  Howell  was  engaged  in  many  very  serious  battles, 
among  them  being  Chancellorsville  and  Gettysburg,  where  he  was

was  made  director  of  the  board  for  one  year.  In  1882,  Mr.  Howell  was 
elected  surrogate  of  Middlesex  county  and  reelected  in  1887,  holding  that 
office  for  ten  years.  In  1894,  Mr.  Howell  was  elected  to  represent  his 
district  in  Congress  and  was  reelected  at  the  end  of  the  term ;  for  six- 
teen consecutive  years  Mr.  Howell  retained  his  seat  in  Congress.  While 
in  Congress,  Mr.  Howell  served  on  some  of  the  most  important  com- 
mittees, among  which  were  emigration  and  naturalization,  public 
buildings  and  grounds.    He  was  appointed  one  of  nine — three  by  Senate, 


26  MIDDLESEX 

three  by  House,  and  three  by  the  president — this  commission  appointed 
to  investigate  the  emigration  question,  both  in  this  country  and 
in  Europe.  Mr.  Howell  was  one  of  the  committee  to  go  abroad  on 
the  investigation,  and  reported  on  same.  He  secured  appropriations  for 
public  buildings  in  New  Brunswick,  Perth  Amboy,  Asbury  Park  and 
Long  Branch.  Mr.  Howell  is  connected  with  two  of  the  banking  insti- 
tutions of  New  Brunswick,  being  elected  president  of  the  People's  Bank 
on  George  street  in  1890;  he  is  also  vice-president  and  director  of  the 
New  Brunswick  Savings  Institution  on  Church  street.  In  fraternal 
circles,  Mr.  Howell  is  equally  active;  he  is  a  member  of  St.  Stephen's 
Lodge,  No.  63,  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  South  Amboy;  and  of  the 
Knights  of  Pythias ;  and  is  a  member  of  the  Grand  Army  of  the  Republic. 
He  is  also  a  member  of  the  Society  of  Colonial  Wars,  his  eligibility  com- 
ing through  his  father's  side  of  the  family;  tracing  his  descent  from  a 
maternal  ancestor,  Mr.  Howell  is  also  a  member  of  the  Society  of  the 
Sons  of  the  American  Revolution.  Mr.  Howell  attends  the  First  Pres- 
byterian Church  of  New  Brunswick.  He  is  trustee  of  the  Presbyterian 
church  at  Spring  Lake. 

At  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  January  27,  1869,  Benjamin  Franklin

Amelia  Dennis.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Howell  have  a  delightful  home  at  No.  32 
Union  street.  New  Brunswick. 


JOHN  VINCENT  SMITH,  M.  D.— The  profession  of  medicine  is 
the  most  ennobling  and  helpful  to  mankind,  and  the  members  thereof 
should  be  men  of  high  character  and  integrity,  capable  of  sacrifice  and 
of  the  utmost  devotion  to  the  interests  of  their  fellowmen.  These  traits 
are  very  prominent  in  the  character  of  Dr.  John  Vincent  Smith,  whose 
careful  preparation,  supplemented  by  close  application  to  his  profession, 
has  enabled  him  to  gain  high  rank  among  his  professional  brethren. 

John  Sheppard  Smith,  father  of  Dr.  Smith,  was  born  at  Fort&gt;  Mont- 
gomery, New  York,  coming  to  Middlesex  county  thirty-five  years  ago. 
He  is  now  with  the  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad.  He  married  Anna  Eliza- 
beth Owens,  whose  great-grandfather  came  to  this  country  from  Ireland 
and  located  at  Peekskill,  New  York.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Smith  are  both  living 
and  reside  at  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey;  they  are  the  parents  of  the 
following  children:  i.  Edward,  living  at  Keyport,  New  Jersey.  2. 
John  Vincent,  the  subject  of  this  review.  3.  Thomas,  a  pharmacist  at 
Perth  Amboy.  4.  Francis,  an  assayer  at  Perth  Amboy.  5.  William,  a 
student  at  Perth  Amboy.  6.  Eugene,  died  in  infancy.  7.  George, 
deceased.    8.  Mary,  died  in  infancy. 

John  Vincent  Smith,  son  of  John  Sheppard  and  Anna  Elizabeth 
(Owens)  Smith,  was  born  August  3,  1888,  in  the  same  house  where  he 
now  lives  and  has  his  office,  No.  463  State  street,  Perth  Amboy.  He  was 
educated  in  St.  Mary's  Catholic  School,  and  the  Perth  Amboy  High

School,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1908.  He  then  matriculated 
at  Long  Island  College  Hospital,  from  which  he  received  the  degree  of 
Doctor  of  Medicine  in  1912,  and  after  serving  his  interneship  of  one 
year  at  St.  Peter's  Hospital,  Brooklyn,  New  York,  he  established  himself 
in  the  practice  of  his  profession  at  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  he 
is  at  present  located,  and  where  he  has,  by  his  comprehensive  knowledge 
of  his  profession  and  the  interest  he  has  displayed  in  every  case  entrusted 
to  his  care,  gained  the  confidence  of  the  residents  of  this  community, 
together  with  a  liberal  patronage  which  is  steadily  increasing  year  by 
year.  On  March  30,  1920,  he  received  the  appointment  of  health  officer 
from  Governor  Edwards.  Professionally,  he  holds  membership  in  the 
New  Jersey  State  Medical  Association,  the  Middlesex  County  Medical 
Society,  and  the  Perth  Amboy  Medical  Society.  In  politics  Dr.  Smith

the  parents  of  one  child,  Anna,  born  January  23,  1918. 


JAMES  E.  BERRY.— The  fine  clay  deposits  of  Middlesex  county 
have  brought  population,  wealth  and  commercial  prestige  to  many  of 
the  county  towns  and  villages,  Woodbridge  having  particularly  pros- 
pered through  the  industries  growing  out  of  this  rich  deposit.  William 
H.  Berry,  of  Gardiner,  Maine,  a  mariner,  after  retiring  from  the  sea, 
located  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  in  1832,  and  there,  in  1845,  he 
began  the  manufacture  of  fire  brick.  He  was  succeeded  by  his  son, 
James  E.  Berry,  whose  family  and  personal  history  follows.  He  is  a 
great-great-grandson  of  Captain  Nathaniel  Berry,  whose  son,  Nathaniel 
Berry,  was  born  in  Maine,  December  22,  1755,  who  served  throughout 
the  Revolutionary  War  with  bravery  and  daring,  receiving  honorable 
discharge  in  January,  1780.  In  December,  1777,  he  became  a  member  of 
General  Washington's  life  guard,  a  body  of  fearless  men  who  were 
with  General  Washington  at  Valley  Forge,  and  saw  service  on  the 
northern  frontier.  He  was  the  last  member  of  the  Washington  life 
guard  to  pass  away,  he  living  to  within  three  years  of  a  full  century  of 
years,  dying  at  Pittston,  Maine,  August  20,  1850.  He  married  Lydia 
Berry,  born  in  Maine,  August  22,  1765,  daughter  of  Lieutenant  Samuel 
Berry,  born  in  Maine,  August  10,  1737.  She  is  said  to  have  been  the  first 
white  girl  born  in  either  Gardiner  or  Pittston,  Maine. 

John  Berry,  son  of  Lieutenant  Nathaniel  and  Lydia  (Berry)  Berry, 
was  born  February  17,  1783,  and  died  in  Gardiner,  Maine,  in  October, 
t86o.  He  married  Elizabeth  Robinson,  born  in  Maine,  October  26, 
1784,  and  there  died,  August  21,  1867.  They  were  the  parents  of  Wil- 
liam H.  Berry,  and  grandparents  of  James  E.  Berry,  of  Woodbridge, 
New  Jersey. 

William  H.  Berry,  son  of  John  and  Elizabeth  (Robinson)  Berry, 
was  born  in  Litchfield,  Maine,  September  18,  1805  or  1807,  died  in 
Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  March  5,  1891.    He  attended  Gardiner  schools 


28  MIDDLESEX 

in  his  youth,  and  from  seventeen  to  twenty-three  years  of  age  followed 
the  sea,  rising  in  these  six  years  from  seaman  to  the  rank  of  first  mate. 
He  was  a  deep  sea  sailor,  and  several  times  crossed  the  Atlantic  to 
different  foreign  lands.  In  1830  he  abandoned  the  sea,  then  for  two 
years  was  associated  with  his  brother,  Albert  Berry,  of  Jersey  City,  in 
the  baling  and  shipping  of  hay.  In  1832  they  separated,  William  H. 
Berry  locating  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  where  he  continued  in  the 
hay  business  until  1845,  when  he  added  coal  to  his  line,  and  in  that  year 
brought  from  Rondout,  New  York,  the  first  anthracite  coal  ever  seen 
in  Woodbridge.  It  came  slowly  into  favor,  only  forty  tons  being  sold 
in  the  town  during  the  first  two  years.  In  1845  Mr.  Berry  began  utiliz- 
ing the  rich  clay  deposits  he  owned  on  Woodbridge  creek  and  started 
a  plant  for  the  manufacture  of  fire  brick.  He  used  his  tremendous  energy 
in  the  development  of  that  business,  and  the  firm  of  William  H.  Berry 
&amp;  Company  continued  a  highly  prosperous  business  until  1896.  Two  of 
his  partners  were  associated  with  Mr.  Berry  for  thirty-eight  years  and 
a  third  partner  for  forty  years.  At  the  time  of  his  death,  in  1891,  he 
was  the  senior  fire  brick  manufacturer  of  the  country,  as  well  as  the 
oldest  clay  miner,  his  connection  covering  the  period  1845-1891.  The 
firm  he  founded  continued  under  his  name  until  1896,  then  was  suc- 
ceeded by  that  of  James  E.  Berry,  his  son. 

William  H.  Berry  was  an  official  member  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal 
church,  was  superintendent  of  the  Sunday  school,  and  intensely  progres- 
sive and  public-spirited.  It  was  largely  through  his  efforts  that  the 
first  public  school  building  was  erected  in  Woodbridge,  and  for  many 
years  he  was  president  of  the  board  of  trustees  of  the  consolidated 
schools.  For  many  years  a  Democrat,  he  split  with  his  party  on  slavery, 
and  in  1856  voted  for  the  first  candidate  of  the  Republican  party,  John 
C.  Fremont.  He  held  several  local  offices,  and  was  for  a  number  of 
years  chairman  of  the  Township  Committee.  He  was  an  ardent  sup- 
porter of  the  Union  cause  during  the  war,  1861-1865,  aiding  in  raising 
troops  and  in  furnishing  needed  supplies  for  the  men  in  the  field.  His 
eldest  son,  William  C.  Berry,  lieutenant  in  Company  H,  sth  Regiment, 
New  Jersey  Volunteers,  was  killed  in  battle.  May  5,  1862,  and  in  his 
honor  William  C.  Berry  Post,  Grand  Army  of  the  Republic,  of  Wood- 
bridge,  was  organized  and  named.  The  Soldiers'  Monument,  raised  in 
Alpine  Cemetery,  Woodbridge,  was  an  object  of  Mr.  Berry's  interest, 
and  he  was  most  active  in  securing  funds  for  its  erection.  In  the 
winter  of  1871  he  obtained  from  the  Legislature  a  charter  for  a  Dime 
Savings  Bank,  and  was  chosen  president  of  the  board  of  trustees.  He 
was  for  many  years  a  member  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church  of 
Woodbridge,  a  trustee,  class  leader,  and  a  pillar  of  strength  to  his 
pastor. 

William  H.  Berry  married,  April  28,  1835,  Margaret  I.  Coddington, 
born  in  Woodbridge,  January  9,  1817,  died  January  5,  1893,  daughter  of 
William  Inslee  and  Christian  (Crowell)  Coddington,  the  last-named  a 
descendant  of  Edward  Crowell,  who  came  to  this  country  on  the  "Cale- 
donia." Mrs.  Berry  was  a  granddaughter  of  Robert  Coddington,  who 
served  under  General  Washington  for  seven  years,  was  twice  wounded, 


BIOGRAPHICAL  29 

and  crippled  for  life.  He  was  one  of  the  party  of  three  who  captured 
a  British  vessel  ofif  Perth  Amboy  one  bitter  winter  night  and  brought 
the  stores  taken  from  her  to  the  shore  on  the  ice.  A  cannon  was  also 
brought  from  the  ship  in  the  same  way,  that  gun  after  doing  local  service 
now  being  one  of  the  exhibits  at  General  Washington's  headquarters  at 
Morristown,  New  Jersey,  the  Woodbridge  Town  Committee  presenting 
it  to  the  custodians  of  that  property.  Robert  Coddington  married  Mary 
Inslee,  whose  family  record  dates  back  to  1669.  The  names  Coddington, 
Crowell,  and  Inslee  are  of  frequent  appearance  in  Revolutionary  annals. 
William  Inslee  Coddington,  father  of  Mrs.  William  H.  Berry,  was  a 
farmer  and  also  followed  the  sea.  He  carried  supplies  to  American 
troops  at  Sandy  Hook  during  the  War  of  1812,  and  otherwise  proved 
his  patriotism. 

William  H.  and  Margaret  I.  (Coddington)  Berry  were  the  parents 
of  ten  children,  five  dying  in  childhood.  The  others  were:  Elizabeth, 
wife  of  L.  F.  Browning,  of  Woodbridge ;  William  C,  killed  at  the  battle 
of  Williamsburg,  Virginia,  May  5,  1862,  a  lieutenant  of  Company  H, 
5th  Regiment,  New  Jersey  Volunteer  Infantry;  James  E.,  of  further 
mention;  Albion  R.,  died  in  1900;  Arthur  E.,  of  Woodbridge. 

James  E.  Berry  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  September 
4,  1845,  and  there  has  spent  his  life.  He  was  educated  in  the  Woodbridge 
public  school,  Elm  Tree  Institute,  and  Fort  Edward  Collegiate  Institute, 
then  taught  school  for  a  time  prior  to  conducting  the  Woodbridge 
"Gazette"  for  two  years.  He  next  was  in  business  in  New  York  for 
four  years,  after  which  he  entered  the  employ  of  his  father's  firm,  William 
H.  Berry  &amp;  Company,  manufacturers  of  fire  brick.  This  was  in  1870, 
and  later  he  was  admitted  to  partnership.  When  the  father's  health 
began  to  fail,  in  1885,  he  surrendered  the  active  management  to  his  son, 
who  remained  at  the  head  from  the  time  of  his  father's  death,  in  1891, 
to  the  passing  of  William  H.  Berry  &amp;  Company,  in  1897.  In  the  last- 
named  year  the  business  was  reorganized  under  the  name  of  James  E. 
Berry,  and  so  continued  until  Mr.  Berry's  retirement,  about  191 5,  through 
ill  health.  He  is  now  (1921)  largely  interested  in  real  estate,  is  president 
of  the  Woodbridge  Building  and  Loan  Association,  and  is  treasurer  of 
the  Barron  Library  Association.  The  business  with  which  the  Berrys 
were  so  long  connected  comprised  an  extensive  plant  covering  several 
acres  along  Woodbridge  creek,  and  in  addition  to  the  fire  brick  kilns 
and  furnaces  erected  thereon,  these  acres  were  valuable  for  their  clay 
and  sand  deposits.  The  property  originally  belonged  to  William  H. 
Berry  and  passed  to  his  heirs. 

James  E.  Berry  for  many  years  was  active  in  public  affairs.  From 
1873  to  1877  he  was  town  collector  of  taxes,  and  for  the  same  period 
township  treasurer.  From  1889  to  1894  he  was  school  trustee,  serving 
as  president  of  the  board  for  two  years.  He  served  the  Sfate  as  com- 
missioner to  appraise  lands  for  a  railroad  right  of  way,  being  chosen 
for  that  post  by  Chief  Justice  Beasley.  Mr.  Berry  was  active  in  the 
erection  of  the  Soldiers'  and  Sailors'  Monument  of  Woodbridge.  serving 
as  chairman  of  the  Site  and  Design  Committee,  also  as  treasurer.     He

is  a  member  of  the  Sons  of  the  American  Revolution;  in  politics  a 
Republican.

the  parents  of  four  children:  i.  Jennie,  who  married  Lewis  E.  Potter, 
and  they  have  four  children:  James  Berry  Potter,  a  lieutenant  of  the

THOMAS  ELY  SCHANCK— All  of  Mr.  Schanck's  active  career 
has  been  spent  in  connection  with  banking,  and  his  identification  with 
the  People's  National  Bank,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  is  a  proud 
record  of  thirty-three  years  of  service.  Mr.  Schanck  is  a  native  of  New 
Jersey,  and  a  descendant  of  families  old  in  the  State.  He  is  a  son  of 
Keortenus  H.  Schanck,  born  November  7,  1830,  died  May  26,  1916,  and 
Rebecca  M.  (Ely)  Schanck,  born  May  20,  1838;  grandson  of  Henry 
Schanck,  born  in  1805,  died  in  1891,  and  Mary  A.  (Mount)  Schanck,

Keortenus  H.  Schanck  was  a  farmer  by  occupation,  and  spent  his 
entire  life  in  Freehold,  New  Jersey.  His  wife  survived  him,  a  resident

Thomas  Ely  Schanck  was  born  in  Freehold,  New  Jersey,  in  i860,  and 
obtained  his  scholastic  education  in  the  Freehold  Institution  and  Rutgers 
College  of  New  Brunswick.  After  leaving  Rutgers  College  he  entered 
the  First  National  Bank  of  Hightstown,  New  Jersey,  beginning  a  finan- 
cial career  that  has  extended  throughout  his  entire  active  business  life. 
From  Hightstown  he  went  to  the  Farmers'  National  Bank  of  Allentown, 
New  Jersey,  in  the  capacity  of  cashier,  and  in  1887  accepted  the  cashier- 
ship  of  the  People's  National  Bank  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey. 
He  was  one  of  the  organizers  of  this  institution,  and  after  thirty-three 
years  in  the  office  he  entered  at  the  time  of  its  incorporation,  he  was

a  strongly  substantial  institution,  its  officiary  and  board  of  directors  rep- 
resenting the  soundest  and  most  progressive  element  of  the  city's  busi- 
ness, and  it  has  pursued  a  career  of  uninterrupted  prosperity  from  the 
time  of  its  formation.  Mr.  Schanck  has  made  its  interests  the  chief 
concern  of  his  active  life,  and  has  served  it  faithfully  and  capably 
throughout  the  entire  period  of  its  existence.  Mr.  Schanck  is  well  knowrn

CONDIT  SNIFFEN  ATKINSON.— The  career  of  Condit  SnifFen 
Atkinson,  the  present  secretary  of  the  Board  of  Trade,  of  New  Bruns- 
wick, New  Jersey,  is  one  of  exceptional  interest,  embracing,  as  it  does, 
many  branches  of  executive  work  involving  the  leadership  of  men, 
rather  than  the  conduct  of  affairs.  In  this  field  of  effort  his  personal 
magnetism,  which  is  so  strong  a  characteristic  of  the  man,  has  carried 
him  far  and  high.  The  individual  history  of  a  man  of  this  caliber  is 
of  interest  to  every  observer  of  the  trend  of  public  affairs. 

Condit  S.  Atkinson  is  a  son  of  Frank  A.  and  Emma  M.  Atkinson. 
His  father  was  a  merchant,  and  prominent  in  the  National  Guard,  having 
served  for  ten  years  in  the  Seventh  Ne\V  York  Regiment. 

Condit  S.  Atkinson  was  born  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts,  on  Sep- 
tember 10,  1867.  He  received  his  education  in  the  public  and  private 
schools,  finishing  at  Rutgers  Preparatory  School,  in  New  Brunswick, 
New  Jersey.  As  editor  of  the  "Daily  Fredonian,"  of  New  Brunswick, 
Mr.  Atkinson  began  his  business  career.  He  accepted  this  position  in 
1893,  and  for  three  years  placed  the  stamp  of  his  individuality  on  the 
editorial  columns  of  this  journal.  Next,  at  the  national  capitol,  Mr. 
Atkinson  filled  the  position  of  clerk  of  the  Committee  on  Immigration 
in  the  House  of  Representatives.  His  tenure  of  this  office  was  long  and 
eventful,  covering  a  period  in  the  nation's  history  when  legions  of  people 
from  every  corner  of  the  earth  poured  into  the  "land  of  opportunity," 
blindly  seeking  the  fame  and  fortune  which  come  to  but  few.  Resigning 
in  1912,  Mr.  Atkinson  was  sought  by  the  Republican  National  Committee 
for  public  activities  in  the  campaign  of  1912.  Long  familiar  with  the 
affairs  of  the  nation,  he  was  an  acquisition  to  the  forces  of  the  party, 
and  remained  with  them  until  the  decision  of  the  people  swung  in  the 
opposite  direction.  This  class  of  work,  however,  brought  out  his  latent 
ability  as  a  public  worker,  and  he  continued  in  newspaper  and  publicity 
work  up  to  1914.     In  the  course  of  his  activities  along  this  line.  Mr. 


32  MIDDLESEX 

Atkinson  was  thrown  more  or  less  closely  into  association  with  United 
States  Senator  Frelinghuysen,  who  sought  his  services  as  secretary  and 
State  manager  of  his  campaign  in  1916.  Accepting  this  arduous  task, 
Mr.  Atkinson  carried  the  candidate  forward  to  success. 

At  this  time  United  States  intervention  in  Europe  was  the  question 
of  the  hour;  Mr.  Atkinson  was  made  publicity  director  for  the  State 
of  New  Jersey  in  the  United  War  Work  Campaign  in  1917.  He  threw 
himself  into  this  work  with  all  the  force  of  his  nature,  and  the  splendid 
record  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey  during  this  period  is  ample  notation 
upon  his  work  as  a  leader.  In  the  spring  of  1918,  Mr.  Atkinson  was 
made  director  of  the  Near  East  Relief  Fund,  and  again  led  the  people 
to  such  excellent  effect  that  the  aggregation  of  their  benefactions 
mounted  to  a  magnificent  total.  He  continued  in  publicity  work  of 
various  kinds  up  to  1920,  when  he  was  persuaded  to  interest  himself  in 
a  local  project — the  Raritan  Terminal  and  Waterways  Association,  of 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey.  In  May,  of  that  year,  he  was  elected 
secretary  of  the  Board  of  Trade  of  New  Brunswick,  which  position  he  is 
filling  to  the  marked  advancement  of  the  interests  of  the  city  and  its 
numerous  mercantile  investors. 

No  record  of  Mr.  Atkinson's  life  would  be  complete  without  mention 
of  his  military  record.  He  served  in  the  National  Guard  of  New  Jersey, 
fourteen  years  as  a  commissioned  officer,  seven  years  as  first  lieutenant, 
and  seven  years  as  captain  and  regimental  commissary.  He  passed  the 
physical  examinations  for  service  abroad  during  the  World  War,  but 
to  his  great  disappointment  was  unable  to  obtain  a  commission.  In 
every  branch  of  public  activity,  Mr.  Atkinson  has  taken  a  constructive 
part  whenever  opportunity  offered.  During  his  residence  in  Highland 
,  Park,  he  was  for  four  years  secretary  of  the  Board  of  Education. 

Socially  and  fraternally  Mr.  Atkinson  is  widely  connected.  He  is  a 
member  of  Palestine  Lodge,  No.  iii.  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  of  New 
Brunswick ;  Jersey  City  Consistory,  Ancient  Accepted  Scottish  Rite ; 
the  Tall  Cedars, of  Lebanon,  of  New  Brunswick;  also  of  Mecca  Temple, 
Ancient  Arabic  Order  Nobles  of  the  Mystic  Shrine.  He  is  a  prominent 
member  of  the  Republican  Club  of  Highland  Park,  and  is  now  serving 
that  organization  in  the  capacity  of  treasurer. 

Mr.  Atkinson  married,  September  10,  1889,  Mary  Jane  Morris, 
daughter  of  William  and  Rachael  Morris,  and  they  are  the  parents  of 
four  children:  i.  Frank  S.,  born  May  15,  1893;  he  served  as  first  lieu- 
tenant of  the  318th  Infantry,  American  Expeditionary  Force,  (luring  the 
World  War.  2.  E.  Mildred,  now  Mrs.  Josephson,  born  February  7, 
1898.  3.  Lillian  M.,  born  May  23,  1900.  4.  Condit  S.,  Jr.,  born  January 
3,  1903.  The  family  are  members  of  the  Livingston  Avenue  Baptist 
Church,  of  New  Brunswick,  and  prominent  in  all  the  social  and  benevo- 
lent activities  of  the  church. 


WILLIAM  CLIFFORD  JAQUES  for  many  years  has  been  a  prom- 
inent politician  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  holding  offices  in  city, 
county  and  State  at  different  periods.     He  is  very  well  known,  with  a 


BIOGRAPHICAL  33 

large  circle  of  friends  who  rally  to  support  him  on  election  day  whenever 
he  is  a  candidate. 

New  Brunswick  is  Mr.  Jaques'  native  city,  he  having  been  born 
there  March  20,  1857,  and  it  is  also  the  birthplace  of  his  father  and 
mother,  Samuel  and  Abbie  E.  (Timmins)  Jaques.  Samuel  Jaques  in  his 
early  life  was  a  ship  carpenter  by  trade,  but  after  a  few  years  spent  in 
that  line  of  work  he  became  a  baker  and  continued  as  such  for  the 
remainder  of  his  life,  his  death  occurring  in  1887,  at  the  age  of  fifty-six 
years.  Mrs.  Abbie  E.  (Timmins)  Jaques  lived  in  New  Brunswick  all 
her  life  and  died  there  in  1917,  aged  eighty-five  years.  She  was  the  mother 
of  ten  children,  of  whom  only  two  are  now  living :  John  L.,  a  resident 
of  Riverside,  New  Jersey ;  and  William  Clifford,  of  further  mention. 

Attending  the  public  schools  in  the  city  of  his  birth  until  he  reached 
the  age  of  thirteen  years,  William  C.  Jaques  then  entered  the  furniture 
store  of  I.  S.  Manning  &amp;  Son  on  Burnett  street.  Remaining  there  for 
three  years,  he  left  it  to  assist  his  father  in  the  bakery  business  located 
at  the  corner  of  Hazard  and  John  streets.  After  a  few  years  Mr.  Jaques 
gave  this  up  and  became  a  fireman  on  board  a  steamboat  plying  between 
New  Brunswick  and  New  York  City.  For  a  time  he  followed  this  occu- 
pation, but  in  1887  engaged  in  the  liquor  business  on  Peace  street,  after- 
ward moving  to  Dennis  street,  and  this  he  carried  on  until  the  govern- 
ment prohibited  the  sale  of  alcoholic  drinks. 

Always  active  in  politics,  Mr.  Jaques  was  elected  an  alderman  on 
the  Democratic  ticket  from  the  Third  Ward  in  New  Brunswick,  holding 
office  for  eight  years.  He  was  twice  elected  alderman-at-large,  and  was 
also  a  member  of  the  State  Assembly  for  the  years  1890  and  1891.  At 
another  time  Mr.  Jaques  was  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Freeholders  of 
Middlesex  county  for  a  year  and  a  half.  In  1886  he  was  appointed,  for 
two  years,  chief  of  the  city's  fire  department.  In  1919  Mr.  Jaques  was 
elected  to  the  position  of  commissioner  of  public  safety,  his  term  of  office 
continuing  until  1923.  In  fraternal  circles,  Mr.  Jaques  is  as  active  as 
in  political  affairs;  he  is  a  member  of  Goodwill  Council,  American 
Mechanics;  the  Knights  of  Pythias;  the  Order  of  Golden  Eagles,  and 
the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  all  of  Ne\y  Brunswick. 

In  New  Brunswick,  October  12,  1873,  William  Clifford  Jaques  was 
married  to  Charlotte  L.  Ryno,  a  native  of  that  city.  She  was  the 
daughter  of  John  and  Rachael  (Labone)  Ryno,  both  lifelong  residents 
of  New  Brunswick ;  they  are  now  deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Jaques  had 
eight  children,  of  whom  only  three  are  now  living ;  they  are  as  follows : 
I.  Samuel,  deceased.  2.  John  L.,  living  in  New  Brunswick.  3.  Harvey, 
deceased.  4.  William  C,  deceased.  5.  Milton  R.,  a  resident  of  New 
Brunswick.  6.  Edna,  deceased.  7.  Sarah,  deceased.  8.  Florantine,  the 
wife  of  C.  N.  Myer,  of  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey. 


FOUNTAIN  BURLEW.— Having  enjoyed  many  advantages  in  the 
way  of  education  and  training,  Dr.  Fountain  Burlew  is  well  equipped  for 
the  profession  he  has  taken  up,  that  of  dentistry;  his  offices  are  very 

Mid-3 


34  MIDDLESEX 

conveniently  located,  being  in  the  South  Amboy  Trust  Company  build- 
ing at  No.  ii6  North  Broadway. 

Fountain  Burlew  was  born  in  Cliff  wood,  New  Jersey,  a  suburb  of 
Matawan,  on  October  i6,  1896,  and  lived  there  until  nine  years  of  age, 
when  his  parents,  Herbert  H.  and  Louise  (Meinzer)  Burlew,  moved  to 
Matawan.  The  elder  Mr.  Burlew  is  a  native  of  Easton,  Pennsylvania, 
but  is  now  a  resident  of  Freneau,  New  Jersey,  another  suburb  of  Mata- 
wan. He  is  engaged  in  the  .wholesale  produce  commission  business  in 
New  York  City.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Herbert  H.  Burlew  four  children 
were  born:  i.  Conover  H.,  a  dentist  located  at  168  Smith  street,  Perth 
Amboy,  New  Jersey.  2.  Frederick,  a  lawyer  of  Matawan.  3.  Fountain, 
of  whom  further.    4.  Herbert,  who  died  in  infancy. 

Attending  the  public  schools  of  Matawan,  Fountain  Burlew  graduated 
from  the  Matawan  High  School  in  1913  and  at  once  became  a  student 
at  Bucknell  University  in  Lewisburg,  Pennsylvania,  remaining  there  for 
three  years  (1913-1916),  then  entering  the  dental  school  of  the  University 
of  Pennsylvania,  graduating  in  the  class  of  1919.  Going  to  Brooklyn, 
New  York,  Dr.  Burlew  started  in  practice,  but  after  one  year  spent  there 
he  came  to  South  Amboy,  and  October  i,  1920,  opened  his  office  at  the 
present  location. 

During  the  time  that  our  country  was  engaged  in  the  World  War 
with  Germany,  Dr.  Burlew  enlisted  and  was  assigned  to  the  Medical

WILLIAM  CHARLES  WILSON.— During  the  thirty  years  Mayor 
William  C.  Wilson  has  resided  in  Perth  Amboy,  he  has  played  an  im- 
portant part  in  the  development  of  the  city,  and  has  not  yet  completed 
what  he  believes  to  be  his  civic  duty.  The  advancement  and  growth  of 
Perth  Amboy,  have  always  meant  much  to  him,  and  among  his  plans 
for  municipal  improvements  may  be  cited:  A  new  railroad  station,  the 
abolition  of  grade  crossings,  development  of  the  sewer  system;  water 
front  development,  including  a  new  city  dock  and  additional  ferry  lines 
connecting  the  city  with  Staten  Island ;  extension  of  the  present  munici- 
pal lighting  system,  erection  of  a  city  ice  plant,  and  development  of 
social  features  as  to  tend  to  develop  public  spirit  and  increase  interest 
in  the  city  of  Perth  Amboy.  This  would  include  concerts  in  parks  during 
the  summer  months ;  provision  for  skating  and  other  sports  during  the 
winter ;  beautifying  the  city  by  planting  shade  trees,  and  continuing  the 
development  of  park  system  as  fast  as  conditions  would  warrant.  This 
is  an  ambitious  program,  but  entirely  feasible,  and  the  mayor  is  heart  and 
soul  in  the  movement  for  a  "better  Perth  Amboy." 

William  Charles  Wilson  of  New  Jersey,  was  born  in  Port  Monmouth, 
Monmouth  county.  New  Jersey,  September  17,  1872,  son  of  Thomas  and 
Elizabeth  Wilson.    Thomas  Wilson  was  born  in  1850,  was  a  farmer  by 


BIOGRAPHICAL  35 

occupation  and  prominent  in  the  affairs  of  the  community  in  which  he 
resided,  serving  for  a  number  of  years  on  the  Middletown  township 
Board  of  Education,  for  nine  years  president  of  the  board.  He  died  in 
1908.  His  widow  still  survives  him.  They  were  the  parents  of  four 
children:  Charlotte;  Eunice,  deceased;  Ethel,  and  William  C. 

William  C.  Wilson  was  educated  in  the  public  schools  of  Middletown 
township,  Monmouth  county,  and  worked  on  the  home  farm  until  he 
attained  the  age  of  seventeen  years.  He  then  came  to  Perth  Amboy  and 
was  employed  as  a  mason  in  the  construction  of  the  C.  Pardee  works. 
He  worked  his  way  up,  filling  various  positions  in  the  building  business 
until  191 1,  when  he  became  a  contractor  and  builder,  forming  a  partner- 
ship with  J.  C.  Fowler.  In  1916  this  partnership  was  dissolved,  Mr. 
Wilson  continuing  the  business  alone  under  firm  name,  W.  C.  Wilson, 
General  Contractor.  He  has  contracted  for  and  erected  many  buildings 
in  Perth  Amboy,  a  number  of  which  are  for  factory  and  scTiool  purposes. 

Mr.  Wilson  is  a  Republican  in  politics  and  has  always  taken  an  active 
part  in  local  affairs.  In  1912  he  was  elected  to  the  Board  of  Aldermen 
and  served  on  the  board  for  the  next  eight  years;  and  in  1920,  was 
elected  mayor  of  Perth  Amboy  by  a  substantial  majority,  succeeding 
Frank  Dorsey,  and  taking  office  January  i,  1921.  Mayor  Wilson  has 
always  been  the  friend  of  the  working  man  and  has  ever  been  to  the 
fore  when  the  interests  of  the  wage-earner  were  at  stake.  During  the 
many  years  he  was  employed  as  superintendent  for  a  contracting  con- 
cern, and  later  in  that  business  for  himself,  he  had  an  opportunity  to 
work  with,  supervise  and  study  men ;  this  has  given  him  a  knowledge  of 
conditions  that  few  in  the  city  possess. 

In  religion.  Mayor  Wilson  is  true  to  the  Swedenborgian  faith,  in 
which  he  was  baptized  in  New  York  City.  He  married,  July  25,  1900, 
Wilhelmina  Koster,  daughter  of  William  and  Wilhelmina  Koster,  of 
Perth  Amboy.    Their  children  are:  William,  Elliott  and  Robert. 


LESLIE  PHILIP  JOHNSON,  one  of  the  most  prominent  and 
influential  citizens  of  New  Brunswick,  is  a  native  of  this  city,  his  birth 
having  occurred  here  February  20,  1871.  Mr.  Johnson  has  always  been 
active  in  everything  pertaining  to  the  welfare  of  the  community,  her 
worthiest  and  most  vital  interests  being  inseparably  associated  with  his 
name  and  personality. 

Alfred  B.  Johnson,  father  of  Leslie  Philip  Johnson,  was  born  Janu- 
ary 16,  1 84 1,  in  Wales.  At  the  age  of  nine  years  he  came  to  Canada  with 
his  parents,  and  at  the  age  of  sixteen  years  came  to  the  United  States 
and  immediately  located  in  New  Brunswick,  where  he  has  continued  to 
reside  ever  since.  For  thirty-five  years  previous  to  his  retirement  from 
active  business  life,  he  was  identified  with  the  Norfolk  &amp;  New  Bruns- 
wick Hosiery  Company  of  New  Brunswick.  He  married  Eliza  Ann 
Phillhower,  of  New  Jersey,  who  died  June  20,  1908,  at  the  age  of  sixty- 
nine  years;  she  was  a  member  of  one  of  the  old  Colonial  families,  her 
antecedents  having  fought  in  the  War  of  the  Revolution.  To  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Johnson  were  born  three  children :  Frederick  Robert,  a  resident  of 


36  MIDDLESEX 

New   Brunswick;  Katharine,  who  married  Elmore   DeWitt,  residents 
of  Jersey  City ;  Leslie  Philip,  of  further  mention. 

The  education  of  Leslie  Philip  Johnson  was  obtained  in  the  public 
schools  of  his  native  place  and  at  the  New  Jersey  Business  College  in 
Newark,  from  which  latter  institution  he  was  graduated  in  1886,  sub- 
sequently securing  a  position  with  the  Ninth  National  Bank  of  New) 
York  City,  where  he  remained  until  he  resigned  in  1901.  During  this 
time  he  also  conducted  a  wholesale  and  retail  bicycle  and  sundry  busi- 
ness at  No.  113  Albany  street,  New  Brunswick,  and  was  also  secretary 
of  the  Phoenix  Art  Metal  Company  here.  When  he  resigned  from  the 
bank  he  was  made  president  of  the  Phoenix  Art  Metal  Company,  which 
was  later  sold  to  the  American  Can  Company.  Mr.  Johnson  then  joined 
the  New  York  Consolidated  Stock  Exchange  and  continued  for  thirteen 
years,  and  in  1914  sold  his  seat.  In  1903  he  was  elected  president  of  the 
Perfection  Jar  Closier  Company,  of  Philadelphia,  which  office  he  held 
until  1906.  In  1912  Mr.  Johnson  purchased  a  farm  just  outside  of  New 
Brunswick  which  he  had  under  cultivation  and  where  he  resided  for 
two  years.  During  the  World  War  he  was  identified  with  the  United 
States  government,  having  charge  of  shipping  material  from  the  Wright, 
Martin  plant,  and  in  January,  1920,  accepted  his  present  position  in 
which  he  has  charge  of  the  property  records  of  the  International  Motor 
Company  which  is  located  in  New  Brunswick. 

Mr.  Johnson  is  also  keenly  interested  and  very  active  in  the  public  life 
of  New  Brunswick,  and  is  looked  upon  as  a  factor  of  importance  in  the 
political  life  of  the  community.  A  Republican  in  politics,  he  served  his 
party  as  alderman  from  1899  until  1902,  and  was  elected  a  member  of 
the  City  Water  Commission,  serving  from  1905  until  1908.  He  also 
served  on  the  Board  of  Education  for  one  term.  In  the  course  of  his 
busy  career  he  has  found  time  to  affiliate  himself  with  some  of  the  promi- 
nent fraternal  organizations  of  the  city,  among  them  being  the  Benevo- 
lent and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American 
Mechanics;  the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  Union  Lodge,  No.  16;  Scott 
Chapter,  No.  4;  Palestine  Commandery,  No.  18;  Mecca  Temple,  Ancient 
Arabic  Order  Nobles  of  the  Mystic  Shrine,  of  New  York  City.  He

On  August  17,  1892,  Leslie  Philip  Johnson  was  united  in  marriage 
with  Cathaline  V.  Berdine,  a  member  of  one  of  the  old  New  Brunswick 
families.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Johnson  are  the  parents  of  two  children:  i. 
Alfred  B.,  born  August  2,  1893;  served  in  the  United  States  army  during 
the  World  War,  and  now  resides  in  Philadelphia;  married,  July,  1920, 
Ruth  Knapp,  of  Carbondale,  Pennsylvania.  2.  George  Leslie,  born  April 
I,  1904 ;  member  of  class  of  1923,  New  Brunswick  High  School. 

Leslie  Philip  Johnson  may  well  be  called  one  of  the  most  prominent 
business  men  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  for  such  he  is  in  the 
highest  sense.  He  is  known  and  admired  for  his  successes,  and  is  much 
sought  for  in  advisory  capacity,  his  opinions  being  ever  received  with 
the  careful  attention  paid  those  whose  judgment  has  been  vindicated  by 
the  tests  of  time  and  whose  business  record  shows  nothing  but  honorable 
achievement.    He  resides  at  No.  93  Bayard  street.  New  Brunswick.

HENRY  GRIFFITH  PARKER.— In  one  of  the  most  prominent 
positions  of  trust  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  closely  identified 
with  many  of  the  public  interests  of  the  city,  is  Henry  Griffith  Parker, 
president  of  the  National  Bank  of  New  Jersey. 

Mr.  Parker  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  on  September  2,  1866,  and 
is  descended  from  an  English  family  of  manufacturing  interests.  His 
"father,  William  Parker,  was  born  in  England,  and  came  to  this  country 
in  early  life,  settling  in  Connecticut;  he  was  connected  throughout  the 
greater  part  of  his  career  with  the  Norfolk  &amp;  New  Brunswick  Hosiery 
Company.  His  death  occurred  in  1876.  He  married  Ann  G.  Griffith, 
who  also  is  now  deceased. 

Gaining  his  early  education  in  the  public  schools  of  his  native  city, 
Henry  G.  Parker  was  graduated  from  the  New  Brunswick  High  School, 
and  at  once  plunged  into  the  work  in  which  he  was  to  achieve  distinction. 
Beginning  in  the  great  banking  institutions  of  New  York  City,  he 
remained  there  until  1892,  then,  at  twenty-six  years  of  age,  he  returned 
to  New  Brunswick,  and  entered  the  National  Bank  of  New  Jersey,  in 
the  capacity  of  paying  teller.  In  January,  1894,  less  than  two  years 
later,  he  was  made  cashier  of  this  bank,  and  fourteen  years  thereafter, 
in  1908,  was  made  president,  which  office  he  still  holds.  During  liis 
long  tenure  of  this  position,  the  affairs  of  the  institution  have  been 
administrated  with  the  most  commendable  foresight  and  discretion.  Mr. 
Parker  now  commands  the  sincere  esteem  of  the  people  of  New  Bruns- 
wick, and  also  of  banking  circles  throughout  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

Outside  his  immediate  interests  in  the  National  Bank  of  New  Jersey, 
Mr.  Parker  has  been  called  upon  to  give  to  many  public  and  benevolent 
enterprises  the  benefit  of  his  experience.  His  response  to  appeals  of 
this  character  is  always  more  than  generous.  Besides  being  identified 
with  many  of  the  important  manufacturing  corporations  of  the  city  in 
the  capacity  of  director,  he  has  served  continuously  on  the  New  Bruns- 
wick Board  of  Education  for  the  past  fifteen  years,  for  five  years  acting 
as  president,  but  at  the  end  of  this  period  declined  re-appointment  to 
that  office.  He  is  on  the  executive  committee  of  the  New  Brunswick 
Savings  Institute.  He  was  chairman  of  the  executive  committee  on  the 
First  and  Second  Liberty  Loan  drives,  which  carried  this  city  to  such 
a  high  record.  Mr.  Parker  was  the  first  president  of  the  New  Brunswick 
Board  of  Trade.  He  is  an  ex-president  of  the  New  Jersey  Bankers' 
Association,  and  has  for  seven  years  been  a  member  of  the  executive 
committee  of  the  American  Bankers'  Association. 

Mr.  Parker  is  a  trustee  of  Rutgers  College,  which  institution  con- 
ferred upon  him  the  honorary  degree  of  Master  of  Arts.  He  is  a 
member  of  the  Union  Club  of  New  York  City;  the  New  Brunswick 
Country  Club ;  and  a  member  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association. 
He  is  a  member  of  Christ  Episcopal  Church,  of  which  he  has  been 
vestryman  for  years. 

On  October  12,  1896,  in  New  Brunswick,  Mr.  Parker  married  Alice 
Florence,  daughter  of  John  and  Julia  (Vick)  Florence,  and  they  have 
one  son,  Henry  Griffith,  Jr.,  who  was  born  August  8,  1898,  and  is  a 
member  of  the  class  of  '21  at  Rutgers.

WILLIAM  FRANK  PARKER,  as  cashier  of  the  National  Bank  of 
New  Jersey,  at  New  Brunswick,  is  well  known  to  the  business  world  of 
this  city.  As  an  individual,  with  many  personal  interests  outside  the 
responsible  position  which  he  is  so  ably  filling,  Mr.  Parker's  history 
forms  a  part  of  the  hitherto  unwritten  annals  of  Middlesex  county. 

William  F.  Parker,  son  of  William  and  Ann  G.  (Griffith)  Parker 
(q.  v.),  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  September  19,  1873.  He  was- 
reared  in  the  traditions  of  this  section,  and  educated  in  the  institutions 
of  his  native  State.  He  graduated  from  the  New  Brunswick  High  School 
in  the  class  of  1891,  and  from  Rutgers  College  in  1895. 

Mr.  Parker  entered  upon  his  career  in  the  manufacturing  establish- 
ment of  his  stepfather,  Alfred  March,  this  plant  manufacturing  a  line 
of  fine  underwear.  He  remained  in  this  connection  for  seven  years.  At 
the  end  of  that  time,  his  ability  being  recognized  by  the  people  of  the 
city,  he  was  elected  to  the  responsible  office  of  city  collector  of  New 
Brunswick.  This  was  in  1904,  and  at  the  two  following  elections,  in 
.1906  and  1908,  was  reelected.  Following  three  terms  of  service  in  this 
capacity,  Mr.  Parker  entered  the  National  Bank  of  New  Jersey,  in  New 
Brunswick,  as  clerk.  He  was  soon  promoted  to  the  position  of  assistant 
cashier,  and  finally,  in  1915,  was  made  cashier  of  this  institution.  He 
has  since  served  continuously  in  this  capacity,  winning  the  respect  and 
confidence  of  the  banking  world. 

Mr.  Parker  is  connected  with  various  public  activities.  He  is  a 
trustee  of  the  New  Brunswick  Board  of  Trade;  trustee  and  treasurer 
of  the  Free  Public  Library,  of  this  city;  trustee  of  the  Red  Cross,  and 
was  its  treasurer  for  two  years.  He  is  a  leader  in  every  public  movement 
which  has  for  its  object  the  welfare  of  the  public,  and  is  a  prominent 
member  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association.  He  is  a  member 
of  the  Masonic  order,  and  his  college  fraternity  is  the  Chi  Phi,  of  Rutgers. 

William  Frank  Parker  married,  April  27,  191 1,  in  Plainfield,  New 
Jersey,  Nelle  Garrettson  Van  Zandt,  daughter  of  Peter  and  Elizabeth 
Van  Zandt,  of  Somerville,  New  Jersey.  Her  father  is  deceased,  and  her 
mother  is  now  living  in  Plainfield.  Mr.  Parker's  personal  tastes  carry 
him  into  the  great  out-doors,  and  his  particular  delight  is  in  long  cross- 
country hikes. 


JOHN  EDWARD  TOOLAN,  one  of  the  most  energetic  and  suc- 
cessful of  the  younger  generation  of  lawyers  of  Perth  Amboy,  New 
Jersey,  where  his  office  is  located  at  No.  174  Smith  street,  is  of  Irish 
descent  and  parentage,  his  father,  John  Toolan,  having  come  from  that 
country  as  a  young  man.  The  elder  Mr.  Toolan  located  in  South  Amboy, 
New  Jersey,  where  he  found  employment  at  the  coal  docks  of  the 
Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  Company  and  worked  there  for  upwards  of 
thirty-five  years.  Mr.  Toolan  is  active  today,  and  at  present  holds 
the  responsible  post  of  bridge  tender  for  the  county  of  Middlesex.  John 
Toolan  married  Elizabeth  McGuirk,  a  native  of  South  Amboy,  and  they 
benrame  the  parents  of  eight  children,  as  follows:  John,  deceased  in 
infancy ;  Peter,  also  deceased ;  Thomas,  who  was  killed  in  action  at  St. 
Mihiel,  France,  during  the  World  War;  Mary,  who  resides  with  her

parents;  Bernard,  who  resides  with  his  parents;  John  Edward,  with 
whose  career  we  are  especially  concerned;  Theresa,  who  became  the 
wife  of  Joseph  Hammond,  of  Roselle,  New  Jersey;  and  Gertrude,  who 
resides  with  her  parents. 

John  Edward  Toolan  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  June 
23,  1894.  He  attended  local  public  schools,  graduating  from  the  high 
school  with  the  class  of  1912.  He  early  conceived  the  ambition  to  follow 
a  professional  career,  and  with  this  end  in  view  entered  the  Law  School 
connected  with  Cornell  University,  from  which  he  graduated  in  1916 
with  the  degree  of  LL.  B.  He  was  admitted  to  the  New  Jersey  bar 
and  immediately  afterward  began  the  practice  of  law  in  the  office  of 
Thomas  Brown,  of  Perth  Amboy.  Shortly  afterwards  he  opened  an 
office  of  his  own  and  since  that  time  has  practiced  alone.  He  has  already 
made  an  enviable  reputation  for  himself  among  his  professional  col- 
leagues, both  on  account  of  his  able  handling  of  the  litigation  entrusted 
to  him  and  because  of  the  high  sense  of  professional  ethics  and  etiquette 
he  invariably  displays.  He  also  enjoys  a  wide,  general  popularity,  and 
his  practice  is  rapidly  growing  in  size  and  importance.  Mr.  Toolan 
has  always  been  keenly  attached  to  athletics  of  all  kinds  and  especially 
to  track  athletics.  He  has  also  interested  himself  in  local  affairs  and 
politics,  and  in  1919  was  a  candidate  for  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
State  on  the  Democratic  ticket.  On  January  25,  1921,  he  was  appointed 
assistant  prosecutor  of  Middlesex  county.  Mr.  Toolan  was  quick  to 
respond  to  his  country's  call  at  the  time  that  the  United  States  entered 
the  great  World  War  raging  in  Europe,  and  for  eighteen  months  served 
with  the  74th  Regiment,  United  States  Infantry,  and  won  in  that  time 
his  commission  as  second  lieutenant.  He  was  at  various  camps  in  the 
United  States,  the  major  portion  of  his  time  being  at  Camp  Devens, 
Massachusetts.  Mr.  Toolan  is  a  Roman  Catholic  in  religious  faith  and 
attends  the  Church  of  St.  Mary  in  Perth  Amboy.  He  is  a  member  of 
the  Knights  of  Columbus,  and  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order 
of  Elks. 


HUGH  BOYD. — A  lifetime  spent  in  journalism,  during  which  he 
made  his  way  from  an  apprenticeship  in  mechanical  capacity  to  news- 
paper direction  and  ownership,  is  the  record  of  business  activity  of 
Hugh  Boyd.  New  Brunswick  has  known  him  for  nearly  half  a  century, 
and  here  he  is  widely  known  as  president,  part  owner,  and  senior  editor 
of  the  daily  "Home  News"  and  the  Sunday  "Times."  The  "Home 
News,"  with  which  he  has  been  identified  since  1879,  occupies  the  daily 
field  alone,  in  New  Brunswick,  having  distanced  contemporary  journals 
(including  three  daily  papers,  the  "Times,"  "Fredonian"  and  "Press"), 
and  having  increased  in  circulation  and  influence  until  it  holds  a  posi- 
tion of  uncontested  supremacy.  The  name  of  Boyd  has  been  connected 
with  it  in  executive  relation  during  the  period  that  witnessed  this  sturdy 
development,  and  Mr.  Boyd  has  constantly  made  it  his  chief  interest. 

Hugh  Boyd  was  born  in  Bangor,  Ireland,  October  31,  1849,  and  upon 
the  completion  of  his  general  education  in  the  public  schools  of  his  birth- 
place and  Belfast  he  entered  the  office  of  the  Belfast  "News-Letter,"

MIDDLESEX 


where  he  served  a  seven-years  apprenticeship  in  the  printing  trade.  As 
a  young  man  of  twenty-three  years  he  came  to  the  United  States,  and 
after  three  months  spent  in  New  York  City  came  to  New  Brunswick, 
New  Jersey,  where  he  has  since  made  his  home.  This  was  in  1872, 
and  he  at  once  entered  the  composing  room  of  the  New  Brunswick 
"Daily  Times,"  remaining  with  that  paper  for  eight  years  and  in  that 
time  becoming  first  foreman  and  then  city  editor.  One  of  Mr.  Boyd's 
associates  in  the  editorial  force  of  the  "Times"  was  Haley  Fiske,  now 
president  of  the  Metropolitan  Insurance  Company  of  New  York. 

In  1879  Mr.  Boyd  purchased  the  "Home  News,"  and  since  that  time 
has  devoted  himself  to  its  upbuilding  into  a  modern,  representative 
newspaper.  How  well  he  has  succeeded  with  his  associates  in  accom- 
plishing this  aim,  the  facts  show,  for  the  "Home  News"  proved  its 
superior  right  of  entry  into  New  Brunswick  homes,  survived  any  com- 
petition that  arose,  and  is  today  a  prosperous,  vigorous  enterprise,  an 
accepted  institution  of  the  city.  Its  columns  have  always  been  open 
to  clean  news  and  to  the  expression  of  honest,  sincere  opinions,  and 
it  has  been  a  strong  factor  in  support  of  good  government  and  civic 
morality. 

Mr.  Boyd  is  a  believer  in  Republican  principles,  but  has  always 
maintained  independence  in  political  action.  He  has  served  the  Young 
Men's  Christian  Association  of  the  city  as  director,  and  the  First  Baptist 
Church  as  trustee.  No  enterprise  of  public  improvement  or  progress 
has  lacked  his  support,  and  in  many  such  endeavors  it  has  been  his 
privilege  to  take  a  leading  part.  For  many  years  Mr.  Boyd  found  a 
large  share  of  his  exercise  and  out-of-door  recreation  in  horseback 
riding,  in  which  he  indulged  regularly  at  his  New  Brunswick  home  in 
summer  and  in  winter  in  Southern  California.  More  recently  he  has 
been  a  convert  to  automobiling,  and  his  cars  provide  him  with  his  open- 
air  recreation.  Several  summers  have  been  spent  by  Mr.  Boyd  and 
family  in  traveling  in  Europe,  his  last  trip  being  in  1914. 

Mr.  Boyd  married  (first)  May  11,  1872,  ^lice  Hickey,  who  died  in 
New  Brunswick,  February  6,  1914.  Mr.  Boyd  married  (second)  in  1918, 
Emily  D.  Voorhees,  who  died  June  15,  1920.  Children,  all  of  the  first 
marriage:  i.  Arthur  H.,  associated  with  his  father;  married,  in  1918,

Regularly  at  his  desk,  from  which  he  has  seldom  been  absent  except 
at  vacation  periods,  Mr.  Boyd  today  shapes  the  policy  of  the  journal  of 
which  he  has  been  so  long  the  head.  He  has  held  the  confidence  and 
regard  of  his  fellow-citizens  through  observance  of  the  strictest  journal- 
istic ethics,  and  in  the  conduct  of  his  paper  he  has  been  as  just  as  he 
has  been  fearless,  as  considerate  as  he  has  been  fair.  The  best  interests 
of  his  city  he  has  served  faithfully  and  well,  and  to  his  work  deserved 
appreciation  is  given. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  41 

IRVING  HOAGLAND.— The  name  of  a  man  who  has  been  so 
long  and  so  conspicuously  before  the  public  as  has  Mr.  Hoagland  is 
sure  to  be  greeted  with  instant  recognition  by  his  fellow-citizens  of  New 
Brunswick  and  the  surrounding  country.  A  career  of  twenty-seven  years 
at  the  bar  and  two  years'  service  in  the  State  Legislature  have  made  him 
a  factor  of  importance  in  both  the  legal  circles  and  the  political  life  of 
his  community. 

Mr.  Hoagland's  family  is  Holland  Dutch  on  both  the  paternal  and 
maternal  sides.  His  father,  John  Calvin  Hoagland,  was  sixth  in  descent 
from  Christofifel  Hooglandt,  who  emigrated  from  Holland  to  New 
Amsterdam  prior  to  1655,  and  who  as  merchant  and  alderman,  owned 
and  occupied  until  his  death  in  1684,  the  property  now  southeast  corner 
of  Broadway  and  Maiden  Lane.  In  1727  Christopher,  son  of  Christoffel, 
purchased  a  tract  of  land  near  Griggstown,  to  which  he  removed  and 
which  has  never  since  been  out  of  the  Hoagland  family. 

His  mother,  Mary  (Voorhees)  Hoagland,  was  daughter  of  Peter  A. 
Voorhees,  assemblyman  and  sheriff  of  Somerset  county,  and  who  was 
eighth  in  descent  from  Stephen  Coerte  Van  Voorhees,  who  emigrated 
from  Holland  in  1660  and  settled  at  Flatlands,  Long  Island,  and  who 
became  prominent  in  the  early  affairs  of  New  Amsterdam.  Peter  A. 
Voorhees  married  Maria  Suydam,  whose  emigrant  ancestor,  Hendrick 
Riker  Suydam,  came  from  Holland  to  New  Amsterdam  in  1663.  Through 
this  branch  of  the  family  Mr.  Hoagland  inherited  the  family  homestead 
at  Franklin  Park,  where  he  was  born  July  24,  1869,  and  now  resides, 
and  which  has  been  in  his  family  continuously  from  1728. 

Until  his  twelfth  year,  Irving  Hoagland  attended  the  local  school 
of  his  native  place  and  from  there  passed  to  Rutgers  Grammar  School, 
graduating  in  1886;  he  then  entered  Rutgers  College,  from  which  he 
graduated  in  1890,  and  thereafter  entered  the  office  of  Prosecutor  John 
S.  Voorhees,  and  was  admitted  to  the  bar  in  November,  1903.  He  grad- 
uated with  honor  from  the  New  York  Law  School,  and  has  been  actively 
engaged  in  the  practice  of  his  profession  in  New  Brunswick  since  that 
time,  having  his  office  in  the  building  of  the  National  Bank  of  New 
Jersey.  He  is  secretary  and  director  of  the  Interwoven  Stocking  Com- 
pany, one  of  New  Jersey's  leading  industries. 

In  the  sphere  of  politics,  Mr.  Hoagland  was  active  for  a  number  of 
years,  and  in  1905  and  1906  he  occupied  a  seat  in  the  Assembly  as  a 
representative  of  Somerset  county.  He  belongs  to  the  University  Club 
of  New  York,  and  the  Delta  Phi  fraternity,  and  is  a  member  of  the  Dutch 
Reformed  Church  of  Franklin  Park. 

During  the  recent  World  War,  Mr.  Hoagland  served  as  chairman  of 
the  exemption  board  of  Somerset  county,  subordinating  every  other 
interest  to  this  patriotic  work  and  devoting  to  it  almost  his  entire  time. 

While  making  law,  and  not  agriculture,  his  life  work,  an  inherited 
fondness  for  rural  pursuits  and  the  environment  of  the  countryside 
has  led  him  to  find  rest  and  recreation  in  the  management  of  the 
homestead  farm  and  in  the  congenial  out-of-door  life  connected  there- 
with. Loyal  in  this  particular  to  his  family  traditions,  Mr.  Hoagland  has 
also  proved  his  fidelity  to  them  by  disinterested  public  service  and 
honorable  devotion  to  his  chosen  profession.

HARRY  SIDNEY  MEDINETS,  one  of  the  successful  lawyers  of 
Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  holds  a  prominent  place  both  on  account  of 
the  ability  shown  by  him  in  his  profession  and  because  of  the  excellent 
reputation  he  has  universally  established  for  fair  dealing  and  a  high  sense 
of  personal  honor.  Mr.  Medinets  was  born  February  22,  1893,  in  New 
Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  is  a  son  of  Abraham  and  Esther  (Corser) 
Medinets,  both  natives  of  Russia,  from  which  country  they  came  to 
the  United  States  about  forty  years  ago,  settling  first  in  New  York 
City.  The  elder  Mr.  Medinets  engaged  in  the  wholesale  produce  business 
and  made  a  notable  success,  especially  in  Perth  Amboy,  where  he  was 
the  pioneer  in  his  line,  as  he  was  also  one  of  the  earliest  Jewish  settlers 
in  the  city.  He  is  now  retired  from  active  business  life  and  makes  bis 
home  in  Perth  Amboy  with  his  wife.  They  were  the  parents  of  four 
children,  as  follows :  Theresa,  who  became  the  wife  of  Ma.K  Semer,  and 
is  now  deceased ;  Elizabeth,  who  became  the  wife  of  William  J.  Cohn, 
3f  Perth  Amboy;  Samuel,  who  resides  in  South  Amboy,  where  he  is 
engaged  in  business  as  a  hardware  merchant ;  Harry  Sidney,  with  whose 
career  we  are  here  especially  concerned. 

The  childhood  of  Harry  Sidney  Medinets  was  principally  passed  in 
Perth  Amboy,  to  which  place  his  parents  removed  from  New  Brunswick 
ivhen  he  was  but  one  year  old,  and  there  he  attended  the  local  public 
schools  as  far  as  the  sixth  grade.  He  then  accompanied  his  parents  to 
Tottenville,  Staten  Island,  and  continued  his  schooling  at  that  place, 
graduating  from  the  grammar  school  and  later  the  high  school.  He' also 
studied  for  one  year  at  the  high  school  in  South  Amboy,  where  he  com- 
pleted his  preparation  for  college.  He  was  ambitious  to  follow  a  prc- 
■essional  career,  and  accordingly  entered  the  New  York  Law  Sehool, 
where  he  pursued  his  legal  studies  until  his  graduation  with  the  class 
)f  1913.    Returning  to  New  Jersey  he  took  the  bar  examinations  and  was 


BIOGRAPHICAL  43 

admitted  to  the  State  bar,  July  7,  1914.  He  at  once  established  himself 
in  his  profession  in  Perth  Araboy  and  has  remained  in  practice  here 
since  that  time,  being  now  regarded  as  one  of  the  leaders  of  the 
local  bar.  He  was  admitted  to  practice  before  the  higher  courts  of  the 
State,  June  14,  1918,  with  the  title  of  counsellor-at-law  and  master  in 
chancery.  Mr.  Medinets  is  the  possessor  of  an  unusual  literary  gift,  and 
from  his  schoolboy  days  has  done  considerable  writing  on  various  sub- 
jects. He  was  editor  of  "The  Message,"  the  school  paper  of  the  South 
Amboy  High  School,  and  has  been  publisher  and  editor  of  the  local  and 
State  Young  Men's  Hebrew  Association  magazines.  He  is  a  prominent 
figure  in  social  and  fraternal  circles  in  Perth  Amboy,  and  is  a  member 
of  a  number  of  important  orders  and  clubs.  He  is  especially  well  known 
in  Masonic  circles  and  is  affiliated  with  Mt.  Zion  Lodge,  No.  135,  Ancient 
Free  and  Accepted  Masons ;  Raritan  Chapter,  Royal  Arch  Masons ;  Tall 
Cedars  of  Lebanon,  No.  216;  and  Salaam  Temple,  Ancient  Arabic  Order

of  America,  the  Fraternal  Order  of  Eagles,  the  Westminster  Cadets, 
the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  the  Young  Men's  Hebrew 
Association,  and  the  B'Nei  Zion  Camp,  No.  20.  As  a  youth,  Mr.  Medi- 
nets was  a  notable  athlete,  being  for  two  years  the  holder  of  the  standing 
broad  jump  of  the  public  schools  of  Richmond  borough.  New  York,  and 
has  always  been  keenly  fond  of  all  out-door  sports  and  pastimes.

INGFRED  T.  MADSEN.— Perhaps  the  largest  hardware  store  in 
Middlesex  county  is  that  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Hardware  Company,  at 
Perth  Amboy,  a  business  founded  in  1909  by  Ingfred  T.  Madsen,  who 
since  1915  has  given  it  his  entire  personal  attention.  Mr.  Madsen  is  a 
native  son  of  Perth  Amboy,  but  he  moved  to  New  York  for  business 
reasons,  and  in  1915  the  same  forces  impelled  his  return  to  the  place 
of  his  birth. 

Mr.  Madsen  is  a  son  of  Laurids  Madsen,  born  in  Denmark,  in  1844, 
who  at  the  age  of  twenty  came  to  the  United  States  and  located  in 
Perth  Amboy,  where  he  died,  February  14,  1920.  He  was  interested  in 
the  manufacture  of  terra  cotta.  His  wife,  Helene  (Sorenson)  Madsen, 
born  in  Denmark,  yet  survives  him,  residing  in  Perth  Amboy.  Dr.  M.  P. 
Madsen,  of  Hastings,  New  York,  and  Ingfred  T.  Madsen,  are  the  only 
living  children,  the  eldest  dying  in  infancy. 

Ingfred  T.  Madsen  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  July  7, 
1879,  and  there  completed  a  public  school  education,  with  graduation 


44  MIDDLESEX 

from  high  school,  class  of  1897.  During  his  last  three  years  in  high 
school,  he  had  established  a  profitable  newspaper  route,  which  he  con- 
tinued for  a  time  after  leaving  school.  In  September,  1897,  he  accepted 
a  position  with  Peck,  Stow  &amp;  Wilcox,  hardware  manufacturers,  of  New 
York  City,  remaining  with  that  firm  until  191 1,  beginning  as  office  man 
and  becoming  manager.  In  191 1  he  began  business  for  himself  as  a 
manufacturer's  agent,  and  in  that  line  developed  a  good  business,  cov- 
ering the  Eastern  coast  States.  He  had,  in  1909,  founded  a  business 
in  Perth  Amboy  under  the  name  and  firm  style.  The  Perth  Amboy 
Hardware  Company,  and  in  1915  that  company  had  so  increased  in 
importance  that  Mr.  Madsen  moved  to  Perth  Amboy  to  give  to  its  affairs 
his  entire  time.  He  has  devoted  his  business  life  to  the  sale  of  hardware, 
and  is  an  authority  on  all  questions  pertaining  thereto.  The  business 
is  large  and  well  managed,  consequently  is  prosperous  and  profitable. 

In  1917,  Mr.  Madsen  was  elected  a  director  of  the  Perth  Amboy 
Chamber  of  Commerce,  and  in  1918-19-20  was  chosen  president.  He 
was  chairman  of  the  War  Savings  Committee,  and  very  helpful  in  all 
war  activities.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons, 
Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  Royal  Arcanum,  East  Jersey 
and  Raritan  Yacht  clubs,  of  Perth  Amboy,  the  Colonia  Country  Club, 
and  the  Hardware  Club  of  New  York  City.  His  favorite  recreation 
is  golf. 

Mr.  Madsen  married,  in  Rohrsburg,  Pennsylvania,  September  27, 
1910,  Lela  M.  Shultz,  born  there,  daughter  of  John  H.  and  Dorothy 
(Henrie)  Shultz.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Madsen  are  the  parents  of  three  chil- 
dren :  Dorothy  H.,  J.  Edward,  and  Mary  Elizabeth. 


GEORGE  DUNHAM  RUNYON,  who  for  nearly  two  decades  has 
been  associated  with  the  "Evening  News"  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey, 
and  is  now  one  of  the  proprietors  of  that  journal,  is  a  native  of  the  town 
of  New  Brunswick,  and  a  member  of  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  widely 
spread  families  of  the  State.  The  Runyon  family  was  founded  here  in 
1665  by  one  Vincent  Rognion  or  Runyon,  one  of  the  French  Huguenots 
who  was  obliged  to  flee  the  persecutions  in  his  native  land  after  the 
Revocation  of  the  Edict  of  Nantes,  and  settled  in  Elizabethport,  New 
Jersey.  He  is  buried  in  Piscataway,  New  Jersey,  and  his  descendants 
are  now  resident  in  many  parts  of  the  State,  many  of  them  occupying 
positions  of  prominence  and  influence  in  their  respective  communities. 

George  Dunham  Runyon  was  born  February  7,  1855,  a  son  of  John 
and  Amelia  (Oram)  Runyon,  lifelong  residents  of  New  Brunswick, 
where  the  former  carried  on  a  business  as  ship  carpenter  for  many 
years,  and  died  at  the  age  of  sixty-seven.  His  first  wife,  Amelia  (Oram) 
Runyon,  died  when  she  was  but  twenty-six  years  old,  and  she  and  her 
husband  were  the  parents  of  three  children,  as  follows :  George  Dunham, 
with  whom  we  are  here  especially  concerned;  Cornelia,  deceased;  and 

John,  also  deceased.    John  Runyon  married  (second)  ,  and  they 

were  the  parents  of  seven  children,  as  follows :  Amelia,  who  resides  in 
New  Brunswick ;  a  child  that  died  in  infancy ;  W.  Parker,  mentioned  at

length  elsewhere  in  this  work;  Frank,  who  resides  in  New  Brunswick; 
John,  also  of  New  Brunswick;  Mary  Fannie,  who  died  at  the  age  of 
twenty-two  years ;  and  Theodore,  of  New  Brunswick. 

The  childhood  of  George  Dunham  Runyon  was  passed  at  his  father's 
home  in  New  Brunswick,  and  he  there  received  his  early  education, 
attending  local  schools  for  this  purpose,  and  he  later  entered  the  Bryant 
&amp;  Stratton  Business  School  of  Newark,  from  which  he  was  graduated 
with  the  class  of  1873.  Upon  completing  his  studies  he  entered  his 
father's  ship  repairing  yard,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty-two  was  working 
at  this  trade  there.  Eventually,  being  of  an  enterprising  character,  he 
came  to  Perth  Amboy  and  opened  a  similar  establishment  of  his  own, 
founding  with  John  H.  Phillips  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company, 
and  they  met  with  notable  success  from  the  outset.  For  ten  years  they 
continued  to  carry  on  this  enterprise,  and  then  Mr.  Runyon  entered  the 
lumber  business  in  Perth  Amboy,  in  which  for  ten  years  more  he  was 
similarly  successful.  It  was  in  the  year  1901  that  Mr.  Runyon  made 
the  vital  change  that  took  him  from  the  field  of  industry  and  launched 
him  upon  his  newspaper  career  in  which  he  has  continued  ever  since. 
In  that  year  he  became  associated  with  the  "Evening  News,"  of  which 
he  eventually  became  one  of  the  three  proprietors  and  of  which  he  is 
now  the  treasurer.  This  paper,  under  his  exceedingly  able  financial 
management,  has  thriven  greatly  and  is  now  one  of  the  most  influential 
periodicals  of  Middlesex  county  and  a  potent  factor  in  local  politics  and 
the  field  of  general  thought.  Mr.  Runyon  is  a  Democrat  in  politics, 
and  has  himself  played  a  prominent  part  in  public  affairs  in  Perth  Amboy. 
He  has  held  a  number  of  elective  offices,  has  been  a  member  of  the 
School  Commission,  and  represented  the  First  Ward  on  the  Board  of 
Aldermen.  He  is  also  well  known  in  social  and  fraternal  circles  in  the 
city,  and  has  been  a  member  of  the  Junior  Order  of  American  Mechan- 
ics for  forty  years,  being  one  of  its  charter  members,  and  a  member  of 
the  local  branch  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  for  a  long 
period. 

George  Dunham  Runyon  was  united  in  marriage,  April  29,  1879,  i" 
New  Brunswick,  with  Melvenia  Lewis,  like  himself  a  native  of  that 
city,  and  a  daughter  of  William  and  Sarah  (Voorhees)  Lewis,  old  and 
highly  respected  residents  there  for  many  years  and  now  both  deceased. 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Runyon  are  the  parents  of  six  children,  as  follows :  Lewis 
Parker,  who  now  resides  in  Buhl,  Idaho,  where  he  is  engaged  in  the 
grocery  business;  Cornelia,  who  died  at  the  age  of  four  and  a  half 
years ;  Harry  H.,  who  makes  his  home  at  Boise  City,  where  he  is  estab- 
lished as  a  successful  merchant ;  Helen,  a  graduate  trained  nurse  at 
Boise  City,  Idaho;  Ruth,  wife  of  Charles  B.  Oakford,  Merchantville, 
New  Jersey;  and  Vincent,  who  saw  active  service  during  the  World 
War  in  France  as  a  member  of  the  13th  Balloon  Company.  Mr.  Runyon 
and  the  members  of  his  family  are  Methodists  in  their  religious  belief 
and  those  residing  in  Perth  Amboy  attend  the  Simpson  Methodist  Epis- 
copal Church  of  that  city,  of  which  he  has  been  the  treasurer  for  above 
thirty-five  years.

OSCAR  OGILIVE  BARR,  M.  E.,  B.  S.— Professor  Barr,  now  super- 
intendent of  schools  of  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  has  been  connected 
with  the  public  schools  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey  for  many  years, 
probably  no  man  in  the  State  having  had  so  wide  and  varied  a  con- 
nection. As  a  teacher  of  elementary  and  high  schools,  he  gained  that 
close  practical  knowledge  of  school  economy  which  distinguishes  him 
and  aids  him  in  his  work  as  county  superintendent  of  schools  in  South 
Jersey,  and  as  city  superintendent  in  the  two  cities  he  has  served.  He 
is  still  a  young  man,  with  many  years  of  professional  usefulness  before 
him,  and  if  the  past  be  taken  as  a  criterion,  he  will  go  far  in  his  pro- 
fession. 

Professor  Barr  is  a  son  of  John  William  and  Louisa  (Lombard) 
Barr,  both,  deceased,  his  father  a  veteran  of  the  Civil  War.  John  W. 
Barr  served  the  Union  cause  as  a  volunteer  under  four  different  enlist- 
ments, covering  the  four  years  of  war,  as  follows:  First  lieutenant  of 
Company  B,  loth  Regiment,  Pennsylvania  Infantry,  1861 ;  second  lieu- 
tenant of  Company  K,  127th  Regiment,  Pennsylvania  Infantry,  1862; 
captain  of  Company  H,  39th  Regiment,  Pennsylvania  Infantry,  1863 ; 
private  of  Company  B,  i6th  Regiment,  Pennsylvania  Cavalry,  1865. 

Oscar  O.  Barr  was  born  in  the  State  of  Pennsylvania,  September  2, 
1875.  He  is  a  graduate  of  Pine  Grove  High  School,  West  Chester 
Normal  School,  Lafayette  College,  class  of  1906,  and  of  the  Teachers' 
College,  Columbia  University,  receiving  the  degree  M.  E.  and  B.  S. 
His  life  has  been  devoted  to  the  cause  of  education,  and  he  has  taught 
in  all  grades  of  the  public  schools.  He  served  the  county  of  Cape  May, 
New  Jersey,  as  superintendent  of  public  instruction,  and  performed  the 
same  service  for  the  county  of  Salem,  New  Jersey.  He  has  also  been 
city  superintendent  of  schools  for  the  city  of  Salem,  New  Jersey,  and 
since  March  15th  has  been  city  superintendent  of  schools  at  South 
Amboy,  New  Jersey.  This  record  of  continuous  service  in  high  and 
responsible  positions  determines  the  value  of  Professor  Barr's  services 
to  the  cause  of  education,  and  testifies  loudly  to  the  estimation  in  which 
he  is  held  in  these  widely  separated  communities. 

During  the  Spanish-American  War,  Professor  Barr  was  a  corporal 
of  Company  G,  4th  Regiment,  Pennsylvania  Volunteers,  and  saw  service

MARTIN  STOETZEL  MEINZER,  M.  D.— Any  history  of  the 
medical  profession  of  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  would  be  incom- 
plete without  the  name  of  Dr.  Martin  Stoetzel  Meinzer,  who  for  the 
past  fourteen  years  has  been  engaged  in  the  active  practice  of  his  pro- 
fession at  Perth  Amboy.  In  devoting  himself  almost  exclusively  to 
surgery,  he  has  won  the  confidence  and  esteem  of  his  professional 
brethren  by  the  satisfactory  results  gained  in  this  particular  branch  of 
the  profession. 

Louis  Frederick  Meinzer,  father  of  Dr.  Meinzer,  was  born  in  New 
York  City,  and  died  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  in  April,  1919,  at  the 
age  of  seventy-eight  years.  For  a  period  of  fifty  years  he  was  proprietor 
of  the  general  store  there,  which  is  still  run  under  his  name  and  con- 
ducted by  his  son  Augustus  L.  Mr.  Meinzer  married,  in  1861,  Amelia 
Stoetzel,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  three  children :  Augustus  Louis, 
who  lives  in  the  old  homestead  at  South  Amboy,  and  has  succeeded  his 
father  in  the  proprietorship  of  the  general  store;  Louis  Frederick,  a 
dentist  of  South  Amboy ;  and  Martin  Stoetzel,  mentioned  below. 

Martin  Stoetzel  Meinzer  was  born  in  South  Amboy,  April  22,  1878, 
and  attended  the  schools  there  until  he  was  sixteen  years  old,  when  he 


48  MIDDLESEX 

entered  New  Brunswick  Preparatory  School,  from  which  he  was  gradu- 
ated in  1897;  he  then  matriculated  at  Rutgers  College,  and  in  1901 
received  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts  from  this  institution.  Having 
already  decided  upon  making  the  practice  of  medicine  his  life-work, 
he  entered  the  medical  department  of  Columbia  University,  New  York 
City,  and  in  1905,  was  graduated  with  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine. 
Rutgers  College  later  conferred  the  degree  of  Master  of  Science.  After 
spending  a  year  as  interne  in  the  Orange  Memorial  Hospital,  Dr.  Meinzer 
began  general  practice  in  Perth  Amboy,  March  19,  1906,  and  very  soon, 
by  reason  of  taste  and  natural  aptitude,  directed  the  greater  part  of  his 
attention  to  surgery,  gradually  eliminating  the  medical  element.  Suc- 
cess has  attended  his  efforts  and  he  is  now  in  possession  of  a  large  and 
ever  increasing  clientele.  In  addition  to  his  private  practice  Dr.  Mein- 
zer was  city  physician  from  1907-1916,  school  physician  from  1907-1915, 
and  physician  for  the  Board  of  Health  from  1916-1918.  He  is  a  member 
of  the  New  Jersey  State  Medical  Association,  the  Middlesex  County 
Medical  Society,  and  the  American  Medical  Society,  and  has  held  the 
offices  of  president  and  secretary  in  the  county  society. 

A  good  citizen,  Dr.  Meinzer  never  refuses  to  aid  and  cooperate  in 
any  cause  or  movement  which  in  his  judgment  makes  for  progress  or 
reform  in  any  department  of  the  city's  life.  With  the  financial  institu- 
tions of  the  city  he  is  also  prominently  connected,  being  a  director  of 
the  Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company,  secretary  of  the  Maple  Realty  Com- 
pany, and  president  of  Perth  Amboy  Business  College.  In  politics  he 
is  a  Democrat,  and  in  religion  an  Episcopalian.  Dr.  Meinzer  is  also  a 
member  of  the  East  Jersey  Club,  and  affiliates  with  the  Benevolent  and 
Protective  Order  of  Elks. 

On  July  6,  1906,  Dr.  Meinzer  was  united  in  marriage  with  Miss 
Elizabeth  Smock,  and  they  are  the  parents  of  one  child,  Helen  Susan, 
born  June  22,  1912.  The  family  home  is  at  No.  42  Market  street,  and 
office  at  No.  284  Madison  avenue,  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 


JAMES  ALEXANDER  EDGAR.— A  good  example  of  the  successful 
business  man  and  man-of-affairs  who  has  risen  through  his  own  efforts 
to  a  position  of  prominence  in  the  community  is  James  Alexander  Edgar. 
For  the  past  sixteen  years  he  has  been  engaged  in  the  real  estate  and 
insurance  business  in  New  Brunswick,  and  during  this  time  has  been  a 
recognized  authority  in  all  that  vitally  concerns  the  welfare  and  progress 
of  this  city. 

James  Alexander  Edgar  was  born  in  Hoboken,  New  Jersey,  January 
28,  1870,  the  son  of  Joseph  Edgar  and  Annie  Eliza  (McCollum)  Edgar. 
Joseph  Edgar  was  born  in  the  north  of  Ireland,  and  during  his  early 
manhood  taught  school  in  his  native  place,  after  which  he  emigated  to 
this  country  and  for  many  years  was  engaged  in  the  wholesale  and 
retail  meat  business.  The  education  of  James  Alexander  Edgar  was 
obtained  in  the  public  schools  of  New  York  City  and  of  Red  Bank,  New 
Jersey.  At  the  age  of  sixteen  he  entered  upon  his  business  career, 
engaging  in  various  branches  until  1894,  when  he  secured  a  position  as 


BIOGRAPHICAL  49 

agent  for  the  Prudential  Life  Insurance  Company,  later  becoming  assist- 
ant superintendent  of  the  company.  In  1902  he  was  appointed  manager 
of  the  Colonial  Insurance  Company,  and  two  years  later  became  man- 
ager of  the  ordinance  department  for  the  Prudential  Insurance  Company, 
remaining  with  this  latter  organization  until  establishing  himself  in  the 
real  estate  and  insurance  business  in  1904,  which  stands  today  a  monu- 
ment to  his  tireless  energy,  his  progressive  spirit,  tempered  with  the 
wisdom  of  conservatism,  and  his  farsighted  aggressive  methods  of 
procedure. 

Mr.  Edgar  has  always  been  loyal  in  his  support  of  measures  calcu- 
lated to  benefit  the  city  and  to  promote  its  rapid  and  substantial  devel- 
opment. He  was  a  director  in  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association 
from  1902  to  1912,  and  at  present,  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Trade.  In 
1912  he  allied  himself  with  the  Progressive  party,  being  a  warm  admirer 
of  Theodore  Roosevelt.  From  191 3  to  1916  he  was  chairman  for  the 
Middlesex  county  organization  of  the  Progressive  party.  He  was  elected 
assemblyman  on  the  Republican  ticket  for  Middlesex  county  in  1916, 
and  reelected  in  1917.  During  his  first  term,  he  was  chairman  of  the 
ways  and  means  committee,  member  of  committees  on  claims  and  pen- 
sions, riparian  rights,  and  joint  committee  on  school  for  deaf  mutes; 
second  term,  chairman  of  committee  on  incidental  expenses,  member  of 
committees  on  commerce  and  navigation,  education  and  stationery,  and 
joint  committees  on  New  Jersey  State  Reformatory,  and  School  for 
Deaf  Mutes.  He  was  active  in  promoting  good  legislation,  always  in 
the  interest  of  his  constituents.  He  had  the  pleasure  of  speaking  and 
voting  for  the  local  option  bill  placed  on  the  New  Jersey  statute  books 
during  the  session  of  1917,  and  has  always  been  a  strong  advocate  of 
prohibition.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Middlesex  County  Republican 
Committee. 

Mr.  Edgar  became  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Education  of  Highland 
Park,  New  Jersey,  in  1913,  and  served  this  board  as  president  from  1914 
to  1916.  He  was  one  of  the  organizers  of  the  Highland  Park  Building 
and  Loan  Association  in  1908,  and  has  served  as  director  and  secretary 
of  the  board  ever  since.  In  1892,  Mr.  Edgar  enlisted  in  the  Second  Bri- 
gade Signal  Corps  of  the  National  Guard  of  New  Jersey,  and  was 
honorably  discharged  from  the  service  in  1897,  having  attained  the  rank 
of  corporal. 

He  is  a  member  of  Palestine  Lodge,  No.  iii.  Free  and  Accepted 
Masons;  Craftsmen's  Club;  Tall  Cedars  of  Lebanon;  New  Brunswick's 
Sportsmen's  Club;  Rotary  Club  of  New  Brunswick,  as  well  as  being  a 
member  of  the  Associated  Automobile  Clubs  of  New  Jersey  and  of  the 
American  Automobile  Association.  His  religious  affiliations  are  with 
the  Highland  Park  Reformed  Church,  in  which  he  holds  the  office 
of  elder. 

On  October  28,  1897,  Mr.  Edgar  was  united  in  marriage  with  Bertha 
Bodle  Hofifman,  daughter  of  Jeremiah  King  and  Margaretta  (Ramsey) 
Hoffman,  of  Clinton,  Hunterdon  county.  New  Jersey.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Edgar  are  the  parents  of  a  son,  Joseph  Hoffman,  born  August  20,  1898,

who  is  a  graduate  of  Rutgers  College,  class  of  1918,  and  is  now  (1921) 
a  senior  in  Yale  University  Law  School,  and  business  manager  of

ADOLPH  CLAYTON  CLARK,  as  manager  of  the  Raritan  Copper 
Works,  holds  one  of  the  most  important  executive  positions  in  the 
State  of  New  Jersey.  The  field  covered  by  this  large  corporation  includes 
practically  all  of  the  United  States  and  many  foreign  countries,  and 
makes  it  one  of  the  most  important  concerns  in  the  city  of  Perth  Amboy, 
New  Jersey. 

The  Clark  family  is  an  old  one  of  Rindge,  New  Hampshire,  where 
Mr.  Clark's  father,  Adolphus  Clark,  was  born.  He  manufactured  min- 
eral water  machinery,  and  conducted  factories  in  Boston,  Massachusetts, 
and  in  London,  England.  He  died  in  Chicago,  in  1918,  in  the  eighty- 
seventh  year  of  his  age.  He  married  Marie  Antoinette  Jewett,  of  New- 
port, New  Hampshire,  who  died  in  Chicago  in  the  eighty-third  year  of 
her  age,  within  one  week  of  the  date  of  her  husband's  death.  They  had 
six  children,  the  eldest  having  died  in  infancy.  Those  now  living  are: 
Adolph  Clayton ;  Mabel,  wife  of  Dr.  L.  K.  Beck,  of  San  Antonio,  Texas ; 
F.  Percy,  of  East  Chicago,  Indiana;  Florence  Louise,  wife  of  W.  G. 
Speck,  of  Sidcup,  England;  and  Cecil  J.,  of  Chicago,  Illinois. 

Adolph  Clayton  Clark  was  born  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  April 
19,  1866.  He  was  taken  to  England  when  a  baby,  as  the  elder  Clark's 
business  required  his  extended  residence  there,  and  his  little  family 
accompanied  him.  The  boy,  Adolph  C,  was  eighteen  years  of  age  when 
he  returned  to  America.  He  had  enjoyed  the  best  of  educational  advan- 
tages in  England  and  on  the  continent,  and  upon  returning  to  America 
went  to  Rhode  Island  and  attended  i  business  college  in  Providence 
for  one  year.  Before  becoming  identified  with  the  Raritan  Copper 
Works,  Mr.  Clark  was  with  the  Pawtucket  Hair  Cloth  Company  of 
Pawtucket,  Rhode  Island,  for  four  years.  He  then  served  four  years 
with  the  large  shoe  manufacturing  firm  of  Thomas  White  &amp;  Sons,  of 
Boston,  Massachusetts.  From  there  Mr.  Clark  went  with  the  New 
England  Electrolytic  Copper  Company  of  Central  Falls,  Rhode  Island, 
where  he  remained  eight  years,  becoming  its  assistant  superintendent. 
This  last  position  defined  Mr.  Clark's  life  work  and  interests,  and  when 
the  company  moved  its  works  from  Central  Falls  to  Perth  Amboy, 
becoming  the  Raritan  Copper  Works,  he  came  with  them  as  assistant 
superintendent.  This  was  in  1901,  and  in  1905  he  became  superintendent, 
and  in  1918  manager  of  the  plant.  The  story  of  such  a  career  might  fill 
volumes;  the  outline  is  quickly  stated;  but  Mr.  Clark's  position  in  the 
business  world  is  thereby  clearly  revealed. 

Mr.  Clark  is  president  of  the  Middlesex  County  Vocational  schools, 
and  vice-president  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Board  of  Education.  He  is  also 
an  officer  or  director  of  the  following  organizations :  The  Raritan  Trust 
Company,  Perth  Amboy;  City  Hospital;  Spring  Lake  Hospital;  the 
Young  Men's  Christian  Association;  the  American  Red  Cross;  and  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  51 

Bathing  and  Tennis  Club  of  Spring  Lake,  New  Jersey.  He  is  a  member 
of  the  American  Society  of  Mining  Engineers;  the  Whitehall  Club  of 
New  York ;  the  East  Jersey  Club ;  and  the  Bathing  and  Tennis  Club  of 
Spring  Lake,  New  Jersey.  He  takes  delight  in  all  out-of-door  sports, 
and  is  particularly  interested  m  swimming. 

Mr.  Clark  married  (first)  in  Pawtucket,  May  27,  1896,  Mary  Edith 
Carpenter,  who  died  in  1904.  They  had  three  children :  Harold  Norman ; 
Dorothy  E.,  and  Adolph  Clayton  (2).  On  June  27,  1906,  Mr.  Clark 
married  (second)  Frances  Matthews  Bates,  of  Binghamton,  New  York, 
daughter  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Miles  J.  Matthews,  who  lived  for  many  years 
in  that  city.  The  family  is  Episcopalian,  and  they  are  members  of  St. 
Peter's  Episcopal  Church,  of  which  Mr.  Clark  is  a  vestryman. 


WILLIAM  NORTHEY  JONES.— The  Church  of  God  stands  as  a 
symbol  of  human  faith,  gracing  the  common  pathway.  So  in  the  records 
of  the  community  the  names  of  the  clergy  stand  as  exponents  of  the 
higher  phases  of  human  history.  The  Rev.  William  Northey  Jones, 
rector  of  St.  Peter's  Protestant  Episcopal  Church,  of  Perth  Amboy, 
New  Jersey,  is  a  representative  clergyman  of  that  denomination,  whose 
life  is  filled  with  beneficent  activities.  He  is  a  son  of  John  Winslow 
and  Adelaide  E.  (Doldt)  Jones,  his  father  being  a  manufacturer,  and 
at  one  time  a  member  of  the  General  Assembly  of  the  State  of  Maryland. 

Rev.  Mr.  Jones  was  born  May  27,  1866,  in  Portland,  Maine.  Fol- 
lowing his  elementary  education,  he  entered  St.  Paul's  School,  Concord, 
New  Hampshire,  in  1878.  He  was  graduated  from  that  institution  in 
1884.  He  then  entered  Trinity  College,  Hartford,  Connecticut,  from 
which  he  was  graduated  in  1888  with  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts. 
He  then  entered  upon  a  post-graduate  course  at  the  General  Theological 
Seminary,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1891.  In  that  same  year 
Trinity  College  conferred  upon  him  the  degree  of  Master  of  Arts.  Later 
he  took  a  special  course  at  Keble  College,  Oxford  University,  England. 
This  splendid  preparation  for  his  chosen  vocation  served  to  make  him 
an  unusually  forceful  speaker.  He  entered  at  once  upon  a  field  of 
missionary  labor  in  Montana,  where  he  remained  for  two  years.  In 
1893  he  was  called  to  the  pastorate  of  St.  Paul's  Church,  Evansville, 
Indiana,  where  he  served  for  four  years.  In  1898  he  became  the  rector 
of  Grace  Church,  Manchester,  New  Hampshire,  where  he  remained  for 
seven  years.  He  was  next  rector  of  Christ  Church,  Williamsport,. Penn- 
sylvania, for  a  period  of  nine  years.  In  1914  he  was  called  to  St.  Peter's 
Church,  Perth  Amboy,  which  parish  is  still  under  his  charge.  He  has 
won  the  esteem  not  only  of  his  congregation,  but  of  the  public  generally, 
and  the  church  has  enjoyed  a  period  of  uniform  prosperity,  both  spiritual 
and  material,  during  his  rectorship. 

Rev.  Mr.  Jones  has  repeatedly  been  called  to  serve  upon  ecclesias- 
tical missions  and  in  bodies  assembled  to  consider  the  problems  of  the 
church.  He  was  examining  chaplain  for  the  Diocese  of  Indiana  from 
1893  to  1897.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Missions  of  New  Hamp- 
shire from  1899  to  1904.    He  has  served  as  deputy  to  the  General  Con- 


52  MIDDLESEX 

vention  at  three  different  times.  In  igo8  he  was  made  delegate  to  the 
Pan  Anglican  Congress  in  London,  England.  From  1908  to  1914  he  was 
president  of  the  Board  of  Religious  Education  in  the  Diocese  of  Harris- 
burg. 

Rev.  Mr.  Jones  has  also  given  generously  of  his  time  and  energies 
to  worthy  secular  objects.  He  was  for  seven  years  trustee  of  the  Public 
Library  of  Williamsport,  Pennsylvania,  and  since  191 5  he  has  been 
president  of  the  board  of  trustees  of  the  Middlesex  County,  New  Jersey, 
Home  for  the  Aged.  His  college  fraternity  is  Psi  Upsilon;  and  he  is 
a  member  of  the  Knights  Templar,  also  a  Scottish  Rite  Mason,  the  thirty- 
second  degree.  For  many  years  he  was  prelate  of  the  Commandery  of 
Knights  Templar.  He  is  now  past  most  wise  master  of  the  Rose  Croix 
Knights,  and  chaplain  of  the  blue  lodge.  He  is  a  member  of  the  New 
Hampshire  Society  of  the  Colonial  Wars,  a  member  of  the  Pennsylvania 
Society  of  the  Sons  of  the  American  Revolution,  and  a  member  of  the 
Colonial  Country  Club. 

Rev.  Mr.  Jones  married,  October  11,  1894,  in  Brooklyn,  New  York, 
Carrie  Louise  Clark,  daughter  of  Edwin  Allen  and  Ann  E.  (Michaels)

OLAF  JACOB  MORGENSON,  city  comptroller,  is  one  of  the  rep-

Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  the  son  of  Ryke  R.  and  Anne  Elizabeth 
(Cheeseman)  Sedam.  The  family  name  was  formerly  spelled  Suydam 
and  is  found  in  the  ancient  Holland  records.  This  branch  of  the  family 
began  spelling  the  name  Sedam  in  1757.  Ryke  R.  Sedam  was  born  in 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  April  5,  1820,  and  died  here  April  20.

The  education  of  Charles  W.  Sedam  was  obtained  in  the  public 
schools  of  New  Brunswick.  For  twenty-four  years  he  was  connected 
with  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad,  and  since  1894  has  been  justice  of 
the  peace  in  his  native  place.  In  politics  Mr.  Sedam  is  a  Republican, 
keenly  alive  to  his  responsibilities  as  a  citizen,  and  taking  an  active 
interest  in  public  affairs.  In  religion  he  is  a  Presbyterian  and  for  ten

WALTER  COOPER  SEDAM.— Advancement  in  any  of  the  learned 
professions  is  generally  the  result  of  individual  merit,  application  and 
skill.  When  these  are  combined  with  ambition  and  a  fixed  determination 
to  achieve  success,  the  desired  result  is  inevitable.  Walter  Cooper 
Sedam,  although  young  in  years,  has  achieved  this  enviable  reputation 
in  the  legal  profession  and  is  numbered  among  the  successful  attorneys 
of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey. 

Walter  Cooper  Sedam  was  born  October  12,  1887,  at  New  Brunswick, 
New  Jersey,  the  son  of  Charles  W.  and  Amelia  M.  (Hudnut)  Sedam 
(q.  v.).  He  received  the  elementary  portion  of  his  education  in  the 
public  schools  of  his  native  place  and  then  entered  Rutgers  College, 
from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1909  with  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of 
Arts.  He  had  in  the  meantime  determined  to  adopt  the  law  as  a  pro- 
fession and,  accordingly,  matriculated  at  the  New  York  Law  School  of 
New  York  City.  After  completing  the  prescribed  course,  he  graduated 
with  the  class  of  191 1  and  won  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Laws,  subse- 
quently entering  first  the  office  of  Judge  Peter  F.  Daly  and  later  becom- 
ing associated  with  Senator  W.  E.  Florance.  On  January  i,  1914,  he 
opened  offices  at  No.  40  Paterson  street,  in  this  city,  and  this  has 
remained  his  headquarters  ever  since.  He  has  built  up  an  excellent 
practice,  and  has  handled  many  important  cases  up  to  the  present  time, 
proving  himself  to  be  a  most  efficient  and  conscientious  attorney. 

Besides  his  legal  practice,  Mr.  Sedam  has  interested  himself  in  the 
conduct  of  public  affairs  in  the  community,  and  has  become  prominent 
in  the  local  organization  of  the  Republican  party.  In  1913  he  was  a 
candidate  on  the  Republican  ticket  for  the  General  Assembly.  He  is  a 
member  of  the  New  Jersey  State  Bar  Association,  and  secretary  of  the 
Middlesex  County  Bar  Association  for  the  past  four  years.  He  frater- 
nizes with  the  Chi  Phi  fraternity  of  Rutgers  College  and  also  with  the 
Phi  Delta  Phi  legal  fraternity  of  New  York.  In  religion  Mr.  Sedam  is  a 
Presbyterian  and  attends  the  First  church  of  that  denomination  at  New 
Brunswick. 

On  May  9,  1920,  Mr.  Sedam  was  united  in  marriage  with  Olga 
Dorothea  Venino,  daughter  of  Albert  and  Emily  (Schumacher)  Venino. 
Mr.  Venino  now  resides  in  Orange,  New  Jersey,  at  the  age  of  eighty- 
three  years,  and  was  the  first  maker  of  wax  used  for  wax  flowers  in  the 
United  States.    He  was  born  at  Kaiserslautern,  in  Rhenish  Bavaria. 


EDWARD  WALDRON  HICKS.— In  view  of  the  fact  that  he  has 
been  thirty  years  a  member  of  the  New  Brunswick  bar,  and  during  ten 
of  those  years  occupied  a  seat  on  the  bench  of  the  District  Court,  Mr. 
Hicks  stands  in  no  need  of  an  introduction  to  his  neighbors  and  fellow- 
citizens.  Two  years'  service  in  the  Legislature,  and  a  year's  tenure  of  the 
office  of  city  attorney,  further  combine  to  render  him  a  "man  of  mark" 
in  his  community. 

John  Hicks,  grandfather  of  Edward  Waldron  Hicks,  was  a  repre- 
sentative of  an  old  New  Brunswick  family,  and  for  many  years  was 
engaged  in  business  as  a  butcher  in  his  home  town.     The  old  Hicks 


BIOGRAPHICAL  55 

homestead  was  situated  on  Burnet  street,  and  was  owned  by  Mr.  Hicks, 
having  been  purchased  by  him  from  Commodore  Vanderbilt.  It  is 
still  in  a  good  state  of  preservation. 

Joseph  Dunn  Hicks,  son  of  John  Hicks,  was  born  in  New  Brunswick, 
and  during  nearly  all  of  his  active  life  was  associated  with  the  Norfolk 
&amp;  New  Brunswick  Hosiery  Company.  He  married  Christiana  Baisler, 
a  native  of  New  York  State,  and  they  became  the  parents  of  three  .sons : 
William  Kent,  who  died  at  the  age  of  sixteen;  Frederick  S.,  died  in 
infancy ;  and  Edward  Waldron,  mentioned  below.  Mr.  Hicks  died  May 
25,  1919,  at  the  advanced  age  of  eighty-seven,  and  his  widow  is  still 
living  in  New  Brunswick. 

Edward  Waldron  Hicks,  son  of  Joseph  Dunn  and  Christiana  (Bais- 
ler) Hicks,  was  born  November  19,  1868,  in  New  Brunswick,  and  at- 
tended the  New  Brunswick  High  School,  afterward  studying  law  under 
the  preceptorship  of  John  S.  Voorhees.  In  February,  1890,  he  was 
admitted  to  the  bar,  and  at  first  practiced  alone.  Later  Mr.  Hicks  became 
a  partner  in  the  firm  of  Voorhees,  Booraem  &amp;  Hicks,  and  the  association 
was  maintained  until  the  organization  of  the  firm  of  Florance  &amp;  Hicks. 
This  remained  unchanged  until  1901,  when  Mr.  Hicks  was  appointed 
judge  of  the  District  Court,  an  office  which  he  retained  until  191 1.  Judge 
Hicks  proved  himself  admirably  fitted  for  the  discharge  of  the  important 
duties  devolving  upon  him,  and  the  manner  in  which  he  met  his  onerous 
responsibilities  and  solved  the  legal  problems  constantly  submitted 
to  him  received  the  unqualified  approval  of  all  fairminded  citizens.  Since 
his  retirement  from  the  bench,  Mr.  Hicks  has  practiced  alone,  having 
his  office  in  the  National  Bank  building. 

As  a  young  man,  Mr.  Hicks  became  active  in  the  political  life  of 
his  community,  always  on  the  side  of  the  Republicans.  In  1895  and  1896 
he  represented  his  party  in  the  Legislature;  proving  himself  a  faithful 
advocate  and  supporter  of  the  rights  of  his  constituents.  In  1906  he 
served  most  impartially  and  efficiently  as  city  attorney.  He  is  a  special 
Master  in  Chancery  and  a  Supreme  Court  Commissioner. 

The  professional  organizations  in  which  Mr.  Hicks  is  enrolled  are 
the  County  and  State  Bar  associations.  He  belongs  to  the  Sons  of 
the  American  Revolution,  affiliates  with  the  Masonic  fraternity,  and 
the  Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows.  He  is  the  president  of  the 
New  Brunswick  Council  of  Boy  Scouts  of  America.  If  he  has  a  hobby, 
it  is  the  game  of  golf,  and  he  belongs  to  the  Golf  Club  and  the  Boat 
Club.    He  is  a  member  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church. 

During  the  recent  World  War,  Mr.  Hicks  served  as  chairman  of  the 
executive  committee  of  the  first  Red  Cross  drive.  He  was  also  a  mem- 
ber of  the  executive  committee  on  the  Liberty  Loan  campaign,  and 
the  Home  Defense  League,  and  served  as  an  assistant  to  the  Legal 
Advisory  Board. 

Mr.  Hicks  married,  October  16,  1901,  at  Metuchen,  Helen  A.  Mallory, 
born  in  Ohio,  daughter  of  Robert  L.  and  Ida  (Baker)  Mallory,  who 
then  lived  in  Metuchen,  Mr.  Mallory  an  agent  and  notary.  Mrs.  Mallory 
is  now  deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Hicks  are  the  parents  of  two  sons: 
Douglas  Mallory,  born  July  28,  1902,  a  student  at  Rutgers  College,  class 


S6  MIDDLESEX 

of  1923;  and  Malcolm  Baisler,  born  December  15,  1903,  in  same  college, 
class  of  1924.    One  child  died  in  infancy. 

Throughout  the  twenty-five  years  and  upward  during  which  Mr. 
Hicks  has  helped  to  make  the  legal  and  political  history  of  his  county, 
he  has  shown  himself  to  be  a  skillful  and  sagacious  practitioner,  a  just 
and  learned  judge,  and  an  able  and  disinterested  political  leader,  a 
man  of  complex  personality,  versatile  talents  and  high-minded  ambitions. 


CHARLES  L.  STEUERWALD,  a  prominent  business  man  of  Perth 
Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  he  is  engaged  in  the  real  estate  and  insur- 
ance lines,  and  a  citizen  influential  in  well  nigh  every  department  of  the 
community's  life,  was  born  in  South  Amboy,  March  i,  1879.  He  is  a 
son  of  Charles  and  Emma  L.  (Herzog)  Steuerwald,  the  former  a  native 
of  Germany,  born  in  the  year  1852,  came  to  the  United  States  as  a  boy 
and  located  in  Keyport,  New  Jersey.  Later  he  removed  to  South  Amboy, 
engaged  in  the  hotel  business  and  met  with  notable  success  and  from 
which  he  retired  in  1912.  He  is  now  living  in  South  Amboy,  a  highly 
respected  citizen.  He  has  been  for  many  years  a  member  of  the  fish 
and  game  commission  of  New  Jersey  from  Middlesex  county,  and  takes 
an  active  part  in  public  life.  The  elder  Mrs.  Steuerwald  was  born  in 
Matawan,  New  Jersey,  and  now  resides  with  her  husband  in  South 
Amboy.  They  are  the  parents  of  four  children,  as  follows:  A  child 
who  died  in  infancy;  Ada  Henrietta,  who  became  the  wife  of  Christian 
F.  Straub,  of  South  Amboy;  Charles  L.,  with  whom  we  are  here  espe- 
cially concerned;  Peter  A.  J.,  who  is  employed  by  the  Pennsylvania 
Railroad,  and  resides  in  South  Amboy. 

The  childhood  of  Charles  L.  Steuerwald  was  passed  in  South  Amboy, 
and  he  has  always  remained  associated  with  the  affairs  of  that  city, 
although  his  business  headquarters  are  now  located  in  the  larger  neigh- 
boring community,  where  he  also  takes  an  active  part.  He  attended 
the  South  Amboy  public  schools,  and  upon  completing  his  general  edu- 
cation there  entered  the  Coleman  Business  College  in  Newark,  New 
Jersey,  in  order  to  take  a  commercial  course.  He  graduated  from  the 
latter  institution  with  the  class  of  1895,  and  immediately  afterwards 
secured  a  position  with  the  great  wholesale  dry  goods  house  of  H.  B. 
Claflin  Company  of  New  York  City.  He  made  himself  of  great  value 
to  his  employers,  and  rose  to  the  rank  of  assistant  general  salesman 
during  the  time  that  he  continued  in  their  employ.  Upon  leaving  the 
Claflin  Company,  Mr.  Steuerwald  went  to  Peekskill,  New  York,  and 
engaged  in  a  manufacturing  enterprise  in  which  he  was  successful  and 
which  he  carried  on  for  some  time,  but  was  compelled  to  sell  out  on 
account  of  poor  health.  After  regaining  his  health,  two  years  later, 
he  accepted  the  position  of  superintendent  and  manager  of  the  Gas 
Company  in  South  Amboy.  This  position  he  held  until  the  company 
was  sold  to  the  Public  Service  Corporation  in  1910,  when  he  resigned 
and  entered  business  in  Perth  Amboy.  Four  years  later  he  established 
himself  in  his  present  line,  dealing  in  real  estate,  insurance  and  mort- 
gage loans,  with  offices  in  the  Savings  Bank  building  at  No.  208  Smith 


BIOGRAPHICAL  57 

street.  His  organization  was  incorporated  in  the  year  1915  under  the 
name  of  Charles  L.  Steuerwald,  Incorporated,  with  himself  as  president 
and  treasurer.  Since  that  time  he  has  developed  a  very  large  and 
remunerative  business,  which  is  one  of  the  most  important  of  its  kind 
in  the  city.  Mr.  Steuerwald  is  a  man  of  broad-minded,  public  spirit,  and 
has  always  been  a  conspicuous  figure  in  the  general  life  of  the  com- 
munity. He  has  established  the  South  Amboy  Trust  Company,  of  which 
he  is  vice-president;  the  Woodbridge  National  Bank,  of  which  he  is  a 
stockholder ;  the  Investors'  and  Owners'  Building  and  Loan  Association 
of  South  Amboy;  and  a  New  Building  and  Loan  Association  of  Perth 
Amboy,  New  Jersey.  He  is  a  Republican  in  politics,  and  though  he 
has  never  sought  public  office  for  himself  he  is  always  ready  to  help 
the  right  man  for  the  right  place.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  Young  Men's  Christian  Association, 
Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics,  the  Raritan  Yacht  Club, 
East  Jersey  Club,  and  is  devoted  to  many  forms  of  outdoor  sports  and 
pastimes.  At  the  present  time,  in  connection  with  others,  he  is  organ- 
izing a  golf  club  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey.  In  religious  belief  he  is 
an  Episcopalian  and  attends  Christ  Church  of  that  denomination  in 
South  Amboy. 

Charles  L.  Steuerwald  was  united  in  marriage,  February  18,  1903,

and  still  actively  engaged  in  daily  business,'  Ira  Condit  Moore  is  one  of 
the  interesting  figures  in  the  business  life  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 

Edward  C.  Moore,  Mr.  Moore's  father,  was  a  prominent  figure  in  the

career,  he  supplemented  this  training  with  a  complete  course  at  the 
Eastman  Business  College,  Poughkeepsie,  New  York.  He  began  his 
business  along  the  same  line  that  he  has  always  followed,  that  of  boots 
and  shoes.  He  has  been  in  different  branches  of  this  business,  first  as 
retail  shoe  merchant  in  Newton,  later  as  treasurer  of  the  Sussex  Shoe 
Company,  Inc.,  of  the  same  city,  manufacturing  largely  boys'  and  girls' 
shoes.  This  factory  was  also  in  Newton.  At  present  Mr.  Moore  is 
president  and  treasurer  of  the  I.  C.  Moore  Company,  Inc.  This  is  one 
of  the  principal  retail  boot  and  shoe  stores  in  Perth  Amboy,  and  was 
established  in  1903  by  Mr.  Moore. 

Outside  of  his  business  interests,  Mr.  Moore  has  always  actively 
participated  in  the  public  responsibilities  of  the  town  in  which  he  was 
located.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Education  of  Newton  for 
seven  years  prior  to  his  removal  to  Perth  Amboy.  He  was  president  of 
the  Perth  Amboy  Board  of  Trade  for  one  year,  and  on  retiring  from  that 
office  assisted  in  the  organization  of  the  present  Chamber  of  Commerce. 
He  is  now  an  honorary  member  of  that  body.  He  is  a  member  of  the 
Presbyterian  church ;  was  a  trustee  of  the  Newton  Presbyterian  Church 
and  treasurer  for  several  years.  When  business  and  public  responsi- 
bilities result  in  the  inevitable  weariness  attendant  upon  all  concentrated 
effort,  Mr.  Moore  finds  delight  and  recreation  in  fishing. 

Mr.  Moore  married  (first)  September  11,  1879,  '"  Newton,  New 
Jersey,  Kittie  D.  Shepherd,  daughter  of  Levi  and  Nancy  (Decker)  Shep- 
herd, who  died  October  19,  1898.  By  her  he  had  six  children :  Helen, 
Frank  Shepherd,  Catherine  Price,  Ethel  Winfred,  now  deceased;  Ira 
Condit,  and  Florence.  Mr.  Moore  married  (second)  Alice  C.  Henderson, 
daughter  of  James  and  Belle  (Duryea)  Henderson,  who  died  in  Febru- 
ary, 191 1.

being  a  subsidiary  of  the  United  States  Rubber  Company.  He  has  bent 
his  energies  to  administrative  direction  and  executive  control,  and  under 
his  guidance  the  business  has  rapidly  developed  along  substantial  lines, 
constituting  an  important  element  in  the  commercial  activity  of  New 
Brunswick. 

Mr.  Weida  began  his  public  career  as  a  member  of  the  Borough 
Council  of  Highland  Park,  New  Jersey,  and  in  1920  was  elected  president

JAY  B.  FRANKE. — Exacting  responsibility  requiring  the  greatest 
skill  is  that  share  in  the  civic  welfare  which  falls  to  the  lot  of  Jay  B. 
Franke. 

The  Franke  family  is  of  German  origin,  but  this  branch  of  the  family

MAJOR  HAROLD  VAN  BLARCOM,  for  so  young  a  man,  has 
lived  a  most  useful  life,  with  enough  adventure  and  change  of  scene  in 
it  to  make  it  far  from  dull;  now  he  is  well  established  in  a  congenial 
profession,  that  of  doctor  of  dental  surgery,  with  offices  at  No.  419 
George  street,  New  Brunswick,  where  he  has  a  rapidly  growing 
patronage. 

Harold  Van  Blarcom  is  the  son  of  Cornelius  Henry  Van  Blarcom, 
who  was  born  in  Paterson,  New  Jersey,  in  1845,  his  death  occurring  in 
Montgomery,  New  York,  in  October,  1908,  at  the  age  of  sixty-three.  In 
his  youth,  he  was  a  manufacturer  in  Paterson,  New  Jersey,  and  Middle- 
town,  New  York,  but  after  he  was  fifty  years  of  age  he  studied  law  and 
passed  the  bar  in  both  New  Jersey  and  New  York,  being  licensed  to 
practice  in  both  states,  and  maintaining  an  office  in  Paterson  up  to 
the  time  of  his  death.  His  wife  was  Fanny  Josephine  Ward,  a  native 
of  Montgomery  and  for  many  years  a  resident  there.  She  now  lives  in 
Paterson.  There  were  five  children  in  the  Van  Blarcom  family:  i. 
Katherine,  deceased.  2.  Wessels,  living  in  Paterson,  and  cashier  of  the 
Second  National  Bank  there.  3.  Frederick  W.,  a  prominent  lawyer  of 
Paterson  and  well  known  as  a  politician.  4.  Mary,  the:  wife  of  Henry 
Bonner,  of  Detroit,  Michigan;  he  is  superintendent  of  the  Ford  service 
stations  of  the  United  States.    5.  Harold,  of  whom  further. 

Though  born  in  Montgomery,  New  York,  October  17,  1887,  Harold 
Van  Blarcom  spent  his  boyhood  in  Paterson,  New  Jersey,  his  family 
going  there  to  reside  shortly  after  his  birth.  He  attended  the  Paterson 
grammar  school  and  later  the  high  school,  graduating  from  the  former 
in  1903,  and,  after  a  four  years'  course,  from  the  latter  school  in  June, 
1907.  He  immediately  became  enrolled  as  a  student  at  the  Philadelphia 
Dental  College,  from  which  institution  he  graduated  in  1910.  The  next 
twQ  years  of  his  life  were  spent  in  Clovis,  New  Mexico,  where  he  prac- 
ticed his  profession,  but  he  returned  East  in  1912  and  locating  in  South 
River,  New  Jersey,  opened  an  office  there.  During  Dr.  Van  Blarcom's 
residence  in  South  River,  he  took  an  active  part  in  the  affairs  of  the 
town,  being  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Health,  and  a  candidate  on  the 
Republican  ticket  for  the  office  of  councilman. 

At  this  time,  1917,  the  United  States  became  involved  in  the  World 
War  and  Dr.  Van  Blarcom  immediately  joined  the  service.  His  war 
record  is  one  of  which  any  man  may  well  be  proud,  for  he  not  only  saw 
active  service  in  France,  but  carries  the  marks  of  shrapnel  wounds  at  the 
present  time.  Dr.  Van  Blarcom  received  a  commission  as  first  lieutenant 
in  June,  1917,  during  his  stay  at  Camp  McClellan,  Anniston,  Alabama, 
with  the  29th  Division.  Lieutenant  Van  Blarcom  was  sent  to  France, 
taking  part  in  the  first  Argonne  battle,  being  gassed  at  this  time.  At 
the  second  Argonne  battle  he  received  two  schrapnel  wounds,  one  in 
the  side  and  another  in  the  leg.    After  spending  six  months  in  France, 


64  MIDDLESEX 

he  was  returned  to  the  United  States  in  December,  1919,  and  was  sent 
to  the  United  States  General  Hospital  No.  9,  at  Lakewood,  New  Jersey, 
where  he  remained  for  six  months  longer.  In  June,  1918,  Lieutenant 
Van  Blarcom  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  captain,  and  in  October, 
1919,  he  received  his  commission  as  major. 

Major  Van  Blarcom  is  a  member  of  the  Society  of  American  Officers 
of  the  Great  War,  and  also  of  the  American  Legion.  In  addition  to 
these  he  is  greatly  interested  in  the  work  of  the  Young  Men's  Christian 
Association,  being  a  member  of  and  a  constant  worker  in  that  body, 
and  also  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks, 
and  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics.  He  is  an  attendant 
of  the  Second  Reformed  Church  of  New  Brunswick.  In  Masonry  he  is 
a  member  of  Union  Lodge,  No.  19,  Free  and  Accepted  Masons.  He  is  a

E.  Viola  Price,  a  resident  of  that  place,  and  she  also  was  born  there. 
Her  parents  are  both  dead.  There  are  no  children  of  this  marriage. 
They  reside  at  No.  261  Powers  street,  New  Brunswick. 

Several  centuries  ago  the  Van  Blarcom  family  had  its  origin  in 
Holland,  the  town  where  they  lived  being  called  Blarkom.  In  1620  five 
brothers  of  that  name  left  the  paternal  roof  and  set  sail  for  America. 
After  many  months  and  numerous  perils  they  landed  at  a  spot  where 
now  stands  the  city  of  Hoboken ;  so  was  founded  by  them  and  several 
other  Holland  emigrants  the  Dutch  settlement  that  for. years  existed  in 
that  part  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  names  of  many  of  the  leading  citizens 
are  distinctly  Dutch  to  this  day,  Bergen  county  being  their  stronghold. 
As  late  as  the  middle  of  the  last  century  the  quaint  Dutch  customs  were 
observed  by  many  of  the  descendants  of  these  settlers. 


JOHN  STROUD  TURNER,  having  arrived  at  the  age  of  manhood 
in  his  native  land,  came  to  the  United  States  in  1881  hoping  to  find  a 
broader  industrial  field.  Seventeen  years  later  he  established  the  J.  S. 
Turner  White  Metal  Company  in  New  Brunswick,  of  which  he  is  the 
head. 

Born  in  Liverpool,  England,  November  18,  1859,  John  Stroud  Turner 
was  the  son  of  Henry  and  Ann  (Stroud)  Turner,  both  of  whom  were 
born  and  died  in  Liverpool.  Henry  Turner  was  a  foundryman  there, 
following  that  trade  until  his  death  which  occurred  in  1895.  He  and 
his  wife  had  seven  children,  all  of  whom  are  now  deceased  except  one 
son,  John  Stroud  Turner. 

Attending  the  public  schools  of  Liverpool  until  he  was  fourteen 
years  old,  and  Liverpool  Institute,  John  Stroud  Turner  became  an 
apprentice  in  the  foundry  business,  continuing  as  such  for  seven  years, 
remaining  in  the  same  line  after  he  had  learned  the  trade.  He  then 
came  to  this  country,  arriving  here  May  24,  1881,  locating  for  a  short 
time  in  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  where  he  worked  at  his  trade.  Then 
Mr.  Turner  went  to  Brooklyn,  New  York,  and  entered  the  employ  of 
William  Taylor,  remaining  only  a  short  time,  then  went  to  New  Bruns-

wick  in  April,  1882,  to  take  a  position  in  the  Consolidated  Fruit  Jar 
Company,  where  he  remained  for  sixteen  years,  fourteen  of  which  he 
served  as  foreman.  At  that  time  Mr.  Turner  went  into  the  manufacturing 
business  in  his  own  name,  founding  the  J.  S.  Turner  White  Metal 
Company  for  the  manufacture  of  collapsible  tubes  and  white  metal 
goods.  The  plant  is  located  at  Nos.  220-222  Raritan  avenue  in  the  High- 
land Park  section  of  New  Brunswick.  In  1916  it  became  an  incorporated 
concern,  and  now  their  products  are  shipped  abroad  in  addition  to 
finding  a  market  in  this  country. 

Mr.  Turner  is  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Trade  of  New  Brunswick; 
the  New  Jersey  State  Board  of  Trade ;  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Asso- 
ciation, in  which  he  is  greatly  interested;  Palestine  Lodge,  No.  iii.  Free 
and  Accepted  Masons ;  Scott  Chapter,  No.  4,  Royal  Arch  Masons ; 
Highland  Park  Building  and  Loan  Company,  of  which  he  is  vice-presi- 
dent; the  New  Brunswick  Boat  Club,  Craftsmen's  Club,  Old  Colony 
Club  of  New  York  City,  and  is  a  communicant  and  vestryman  of  Christ 
Protestant  Episcopal  Church,  New  Brunswick. 

In  October,  1884,  John  Stroud  Turner  was  united  in  marriage  with 
Sarah  Jane  Myers  in  New  Brunswick,  that  being  also  her  birthplace. 
She  is  the  daughter  of  C.  P.  and  Jane  (Stewart)  Myers,  residenis  of 
New  Brunswick,  where  they  were  also  born  and  where  they  died.  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Turner  have  four  children,  all  living,  namely:  i.  Henry 
James,  residing  in  Camden,  New  Jersey;  married  Ethel  M.  Lott,  of 
Philadelphia;  one  child,  Ethel  May.  2.  George  S.,  resides  at  No.  334 
South  Third  avenue.  New  Brunswick;  married  Miss  S.  B.  Austin,  and 
they  have  two  children,  Ruth  and  George  E.  3.  Helen,  wife  of  Henry 
L.  Van  Mater;  they  reside  at  No.  216  South  Third  avenue.  New  Bruns- 
wick ;  one  child,  John  S.  4.  John  E.  The  family  residence  is  at  No.  218 
Raritan  avenue.  Highland  Park. 


RUSSELL  ELLSWORTH  WATSON.— The  name  we  have  just 
written  will  receive,  as  that  of  one  of  the  well  known  members  of  the 
New  Brunswick  bar,  instant  recognition  from  a  majority  of  his  fellow- 
citizens.  During  the  recent  conflict  of  nations,  Mr.  Watson  was  at 
the  front  in  war  activities,  and  in  the  club  circles  of  his  home  citv  he  is 
a  prominent  figure. 

Frank  Ellsworth  Watson,  father  of  Russell  Ellsworth  Watson,  was 
born  in  Detroit,  Michigan,  and  is  now  a  resident  of  New  Brunswick, 
and  a  manufacturer  of  wallpaper  colors  and  oil  paints.  He  married  Sarah 
Elizabeth  Painter,  born  at  Glen  Gardner,  New  Jersey,  and  they  are  the 
parents  of  the  following  children :  Russell  Ellsworth,  mentioned  below ; 
Parker  L. ;  Franklin  Lamar,  whose  biography  follows  in  this  work ;  and 
A.  Dudley,  also  represented  in  this  work  by  a  biography  following.  All 
these,  with  the  exception  of  Parker  L.,  are  residents  of  New  Brunswick. 

Russell  Ellsworth  Watson,  son  of  Frank  Ellsworth  and  Sarah  Eliza- 
beth (Painter)  Watson,  was  born  October  8,  1885,  in  New  Brunswick, 
and  in  1902  graduated  from  the  New  Brunswick  High  School.  The  same 
year  he  entered  Rutgers  College,  remaining  until  1905.     He  was  fitted 

Mid-5 


66  MIDDLESEX 

for  his  profession  at  the  New  York  Law  School,  receiving,  in  1907,  the 
degree  of  Bachelor  of  Laws.  In  February,  1909,  he  was  admitted  to  the 
New  Jersey  bar  as  attorney,  and  in  1912  was  admitted  as  counsellor. 

In  entering  upon  the  practice  of  his  profession,  Mr.  Watson  was 
associated  with  Theodore  B.  Booraem,  the  connection  remaining  un- 
broken until  1912,  when  it  was  dissolved  by  Mr.  Booraem's  death.  Mr. 
Watson  then  practiced  alone,  having  his  offices  at  Nos.  41-43  Paterson 
street,  until  September,  1920,  when  R.  E.  and  A.  D,  Watson  formed  a 
partnership,  practicing  under  that  heading.  Mr.  Watson  has  proved 
himself  possessed  of  the  qualifications  requisite  for  success  .at  the  bar, 
his  record  showing,  with  the  lapse  of  every  year,  additional  evidence 
of  this  incontrovertible  fact. 

In  the  political  life  of  his  community  Mr.  Watson  has,  for  many 
years,  borne  an  active  part.  From  1908  to  191 1  he  served  as  probation 
officer  of  Middlesex  county,  and  from  191 1  to  1912  he  was  assistant 
prosecutor  for  the  county.  In  1916  his  fellow-citizens  of  Highland 
Park  summoned  him  to  serve  them  in  the  highest  municipal  office  in 
their  gift,  retaining  him  in  it,  by  reelection,  until  1920.  During  the  recent 
World  War  Mr.  Watson  was  patriotically  active,  serving  as  fuel  admin- 
istrator for  both  Middlesex  and  Somerset  counties.  He  is  a  director 
of  the  Building  and  Loan  Association. 

The  fraternal  connections  of  Mr.  Watson  include  affiliation  with 
the  Masonic  order,  being  a  member  of  Palestine  Lodge,  No.  iii.  Free 
and  Accepted  Masons;  Scott  Chapter,  No.  4,  Royal  Arch  Masons;  and 
Salaam  Temple,  Ancient  Arabic  Order  Nobles  of  the  Mystic  Shrine. 
He  is  also  a  member  of  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics, 
and  the  Chi  Psi  fraternity.  He  belongs  to  the  Union  Club,  the  East 
Jersey  Club  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  the  New  Brunswick  Country  Club. 
He  and  his  family  are  members  of  the  First  Reformed  Church. 

Mr.  Watson  married,  March  24,  1909,  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  Beulah 
Fraleigh  Fingarr,  daughter  of  Montgomery  and  Helena  (Fraleigh) 
Fingarr.  Mr.  Fingarr  served  in  the  Civil  War,  and  his  death,  which 
occurred  in  1883,  was  the  result  of  injuries  received  while  in  service. 
His  widow  now  resides  with  her  daughter  and  son-in-law.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Watson  are  the  parents  of  the  following  children:  Russell  Ells- 
worth, Jr.,  born  September  2,  191 1;  Malcolm  D.,  born  September  11, 
1913;  Jean,  born  August  9,  1916;  and  Sarah  Elizabeth,  born  December 
28,  1917. 

By  his  own  unaided  efforts,  Mr.  Watson  has  achieved  marked  pro- 
fessional success,  and  his  fellow-citizens  have  paid  him  the  tribute  of 
calling  him  to  serve  them  in  offices  of  exceptional  responsibility.    Every- 
thing indicates  that  the  future  holds  for  him  greater  advancement  in. 
his  work  and  a  summons  to  larger  and  more  complicated  trusts. 


FRANKLIN  LAMAR  WATSON.— Among  the  younger  business 
men  of  New  Brunswick,  always  remarkable  for  enterprise  and  aggres- 
siveness, no  one  could  fail  to  number  Mr.  Watson,  who  is  now  associated 
with  the  Packard  Motor  Car  Company,  one  of  the  best  known  concem.s 


BIOGRAPHICAL  67 

of  its  kind  to  be  found  in  the  United  States.  Mr,  Watson  has  an  hon- 
orable record  of  military  service  in  the  recent  World  War,  and  is  well 
known  in  the  social  circles  of  New  Brunswick  no  less  than  in  the  sphere 
of  her  business  activities. 

Franklin  Lamar  Watson  was  born  November  22,  1891,  in  New 
Brunswick,  and  is  a  son  of  Frank  Ellsworth  and  Sarah  Elizabeth 
(Painter)  Watson  (q.  v.),  and  a  brother  of  Russell  Ellsworth  and  A. 
Dudley  Watson  (q.  v.).  The  early  education  of  Franklin  Lamar  Wat- 
son was  received  in  the  public  schools  of  his  native  city,  whence  he 
passed  to  the  New  Brunswick  High  School,  graduating  from  that  insti- 
tution with  the  class  of  1909. 

Becoming  one  of  the  official  stenographers  of  the  Essex  county 
courts,  Mr.  Watson  held  that  position  until  June,  1917,  when  he  resigned, 
having  been  among  the  first  to  respond  to  the  call  for  volunteers  issued 
upon  the  entrance  of  the  United  States  into  the  greatest  war  in  history. 
In  May,  1917,  Mr.  Watson  enlisted  as  sergeant,  first-class,  in  the  Quar- 
termasters' Reserve  Corps  of  the  army,  and  in  December,  1917,  was 
transferred  to  the  air  service.  After  graduating  from  the  School  of 
Military  Aeronautics  at  Texas  University,  he  took  training  in  flying 
at  Park  Field,  Tennessee.  He  was  afterward  commissioned  second 
lieutenant  and  appointed  assistant  post  adjutant  and  assistant  judge 
advocate.  In  March,  1919,  he  was  discharged.  On  returning  to  New 
Brunswick,  Mr.  Watson  associated  himself  with  the  Packard  Motor 
Car  Company,  securing  a  position  in  the  passenger  transportation  depart- 
ment. 

The  clubs  in  which  Mr.  Watson  holds  membership  are  the  Union 
Club  of  New  Brunswick,  the  Aero  Club  of  America,  and  the  Air  Service 
Clubs  Association.  He  affiliates  with  the  Benevolent  and  Protective 
Order  of  Elks.  Franklin  Lamar  Watson  has  proved  his  metal,  both 
as  soldier  and  business  man,  for  in  both  capacities  he  has  rendered 
faithful  and  valuable  service. 


ASHER  DUDLEY  WATSON.— Despite  the  fact  that  less  than 
four  years  have  elapsed  since  his  admission  to  the  bar,  Mr.  Watson's 
name,  as  a  member  of  the  profession,  has  already  become  favorably  famil- 
iar to  a  large  number  of  his  fellow-citizens  of  New  Brunswick.  It  is  also 
familiar  as  that  of  one  of  those  who  during  the  late  war  rendered  military 
service  in  France. 

Asher  Dudley  Watson  was  born  December  6,  1893,  in  New  Bruns- 
wick, and  is  a  son  of  Frank  Ellsworth  and  Sarah  Elizabeth  (Painter) 
Watson  (q.  v.),  and  a  brother  of  Russell  Ellsworth  and  Franklin  Lamar 
Watson  (q.  v.).  In  191 1  Asher  Dudley  Watson  graduated  from  the 
New  Brunswick  High  School,  and  in  1915  he  received  his  degree  from 
Rutgers  College.  His  legal  studies  were  pursued  under  the  guidance  of 
his  brother,  Russell  Ellsworth  Watson,  and  he  also  attended  the  New 
York  Law  School.    In  January,  1917,  he  was  admitted  to  the  bar. 

Entering  upon  the  practice  of  his  profession  in  association  with  his 
brother,  Russell  Ellsworth  Watson,  the  young  lawyer  began  his  career 


68  MIDDLESEX 

under  the  most  favorable  auspices,  but,  almost  at  its  inception,  it  suf- 
fered an  interruption.  The  United  States,  taking  her  place  among  the 
contending  nations,  called  her  loyal  sons  to  take  up  arms  in  her  behalf, 
and  among  the  first  to  respond  was  Asher  Dudley  Watson.  Entering 
the  service  in  September,  1917,  as  a  member  of  Headquarters  Company, 
311th  Infantry,  78th  Division,  he  arrived  in  France,  June  i,  1918.  On 
May  10,  1919,  he  left,  having  participated  in  the  battles  of  St.  Mihiel 
offensive  and  the  Meuse-Argonne  offensive.  On  May  30,  1919,  he  was 
honorably  discharged. 

In  politics  Mr.  Watson  is  a  Republican,  and  he  is  a  member  of  the 
County  Bar  Association,  and  Rutgers  Alumni  Association.  His  religious 
membership  is  in  the  First  Reformed  Church. 

Since  his  return  from  overseas,  Mr.  Watson  has  resumed  the  prac- 
tice of  his  profession  and  is  now  steadily  engaged  in  building  up  a  repu- 
tation on  the  sure  foundation  of  ability,  knowledge  and  devotion  to 
duty.  In  June,  1920,  he  was  made  a  counsellor,  and  in  the  fall  of  192(7. 
he  and  his  brother,  Russell  Ellsworth,  formed  the  legal  partnership  of 
R.  E.  &amp;  A.  D.  Watson,  counsellors  at  law,  with  offices  at  Nos.  41-43 
Paterson  street. 


HENRY  WILLIAM  SCHRIMPF.— This  is  the  name  of  a  man  who 
is  not  only  one  of  the  best  known  citizens  of  Perth  Amboy,  but  who  has 
built  up  for  himself  a  reputation  far  exceeding  the  limits  of  his  own 
community.  It  is  needless  to  say  that  Mr.  Schrimpf  is  the  founder  of 
the  firm  of  H.  W.  Schrimpf  &amp;  Company,  engineers,  or  that  he  is  one 
of  the  most  respected  and  popular  men  within  the  boundaries  of  the 
community. 

Adam  Schrimpf,  father  of  Henry  W.  Schrimpf,  was  born  in  Germany, 
came  to  this  country  when  a  lad,  and  located  in  Newark,  New  Jersey. 
He  was  a  farmer  and  later  became  a  wine  merchant,  and  died  at  the 
age  of  fifty-nine  years.  He  married  Mary  Bensman,  and  they  were  the 
parents  of  six  children:  Carrie,  wife  of  Fred  Buclhart,  of  Newark; 
Henry  William,  mentioned  below;  Adam,  of  Perth  Amboy,  a  foreman 
for  his  brother  Henry  W. ;  Emma,  died  in  infancy ;  Emma,  wife  of  Fred 
Geisicker,  of  Newark,  New  Jersey ;  John,  died  at  the  age  of  five  years. 

Henry  William  Schrimpf  was  born  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  February  ' 
3,  1876.  His  education  was  begun  in  the  primary  department  of  the 
school  adjacent  to  his  home,  whence  he  passed  successively  to  the 
grammar  and  high  schools,  terminating  his  studies  at  the  age  of  sixteen, 
when  he  began  an  apprenticeship  to  the  carpenter's  trade,  subsequently 
becoming  foreman  of  a  building  concern  there,  and  later  accepting  the 
position  of  foreman  of  Goller  Iron  Works,  and  then  being  made  super- 
intendent of  iron  construction.  In  1909  he  came  to  Perth  Amboy  and 
established  himself  in  his  present  business  with  office  and  works  on 
Lewis  street  and  Second  street.  Mr.  Schrimpf  gives  the  works  and 
workmen  his  personal  supervision,  and  in  addition  is  gifted  with 
extraordinary  business  ability  and  skill  in  the  management  of  affairs. 
Among  the  many  contracts  for  the  erection  of  structural  steel  work  may 


/^V^&gt;*^'''^^^&lt;::2^-^0-^.i»-^-t^^^^ 


BIOGRAPHICAL  69 

be  mentioned:  The  entire  steel  construction  of  Greek  Catholic  church; 
several  large  factory  buildings  for  Raritan  Copper  Works;  Standard 
Underground  Cable  Works;  Cheeseborough  Manufacturing  Company; 
R.  &amp;  H.  Chemical  Company;  also  erected  the  Convery  Place  Bridge 
and  also  several  bridges  for  the  State,  the  last  being  one  of  the  most 
important  contracts  taken  by  him. 

An  independent  in  politics,  Mr.  Schrimpf  votes  for  the  man,  regard- 
less of  party  label.  He  affiliates  with  Americus  Lodge,  No.  83,  Free  and 
Accepted  Masons ;  Royal  Arch  Masons,  Chapter  No.  41 ;  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  Lodge  No.  784;  and  with  the  Woodmen 
of  the  World.  He  is  also  a  member  of  H.  J.  Michaels'  Pleasure  Club, 
Raritan  Yacht  Club,  and  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association.  In 
religion  he  is  a  Presbyterian. 

On  May  14,  1899,  Henry  William  Schrimpf  was  united  in  marriage 
with  Josephine  Miller,  a  daughter  of  the  late  Charles  and  Josephine 
Miller,  old  residents  of  Newark.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Schrimpf  are  the  parents 
of  four  children :  Herbert  Charles,  associated  with  his  father  in  business ; 
Charles  Adam,  deceased ;  Elsie ;  Henry  William,  Jr. 

The  business  life  of  Mr.  Schrimpf  is  one  of  rugged  honesty,  and  intol- 
erance of  shams  and  makeshifts  are  among  his  marked  characteristics. 
His  innate  love  of  justice  and  fair  dealing  have  won  for  him  the  con- 
fidence and  esteem  of  his  associates,  and  of  all  with  whom  he  has  business 
relations,  while  by  those  under  his  charge  he  is  regarded  not  only  as  a 
just  and  honorable  man,  but  as  a  personal  friend  and  counsellor. 


ARMAND  PIERE  DAIRE,  at  seventy-three  years  of  age,  senior 
member  of  the  firm  of  Daire  &amp;  Son,  No.  20  Bayard  street,  New  Bruns- 
wick, continues  active  in  carriage  building,  a  business  with  which  he 
has  been  identified  in  various  capacities  for  the  greater  part  of  his  life. 
Mr.  Daire's  life  history  from  boyhood  reads  like  a  romance,  and  from  an 
interesting  autobiography  prepared  by  him  at  the  urgent  requests  of 
his  family  the  following  facts  are  taken,  though  in  the  transposition  the 
intimate  personal  touch  which  gives  it  much  of  its  charm  is  of  necessity 
lost.  Beginning  with  his  boyhood  in  the  old  New  Orleans  of  before  the 
war,  carrying  through  his  runaway  enlistment  in  the  Union  army  during 
the  Civil  War  and  his  army  campaigning,  depicting  his  connection  with 
the  stage  and  the  French  theatre  in  the  United  States  and  the  provinces, 
outlining  his  business  vicissitudes  and  successes,  and  concluding  with 
a  tribute  of  appreciation  to  a  dutiful  and  loving  family,  it  is  an  absorbing 
narrative,  a  document  which  his  family  will  treasure  beyond  price  as 
the  years  pass. 

Mr.  Daire's  father,  a  young  lawyer  at  the  time  of  his  marriage,  was 
of  Spanish-French  descent,  his  parents  small  plantation  owners  of 
Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana.  He  went  to  California  two  years  after  the 
birth  of  his  son,  joining  the  gold  rush  of  1849,  accumulated  a  competence 
in  his  profession  and  in  buying  and  selling  of  claims,  and  met  his  death 
in  the  loss  of  the  vessel  in  which  he  was  making  the  homeward  voyage, 
the  "Belle  Assise."

His  mother,  a  native  of  France,  Alexandrine  Rose  Maison,  was  the 
daughter  of  a  Napoleonic  soldier  who  was  later  given  the  position  of 
customs'  collector  at  the  Octroi  gate  of  Paris.  She  was  reared  by  her 
grandparents,  gardeners  in  the  nursery  of  the  king  during  the  reign  of 
Louis  Philip,  and  was  educated  in  a  Sisters'  school,  graduating  when 
fifteen  or  sixteen  years  of  age,  and  then  completing  a  two  years'  course 
in  the  Conservatory  of  Music  of  Paris,  where  her  contralto  voice  of 
magnificent  strength  and  tone  was  trained.  She  entered  an  opera  troupe, 
playing  in  the  provinces  of  France,  and  soon  afterward  was  married 
to  an  actor  named  Eshevelle,  to  whom  she  bore  a  daughter,  Mary. 
The  husband  and  father  died  in  about  a  year,  and  the  mother  continued 
her  musical  career  in  France  and  the  United  States.  Her  second  mar- 
riage was  her  last.  Armand  Piere  Daire  was  born  of  this  marriage, 
and  after  Mr.  Daire's  death  in  shipwreck  Mrs.  Daire  remained  on  the 
stage  until  the  strain  of  her  profession  became  too  great  for  her  advanc- 
ing years,  when  she  retired,  teaching  French  during  her  last  years. 

Armand  Piere  Daire  was  born  in  New  Orleans,  Louisiana,  April  17, 
1847.  His  mother's  musical  engagements  made  a  permanent  home  an 
impossibility,  and  he  was  placed  in  the  care  of  a  Madam  Petite,  he  and 
his  sister  later  entering  the  home  of  his  godmother,  Madame  Alfred, 
four  or  five  years  being  spent  between  the  two  places.  The  mother 
accepting  an  engagement  with  the  Italian  Opera  Company  of  New  York, 
the  little  family  made  the  journey  up  the  Mississippi  river,  the  children 
being  left  with  a  family  named  Sage,  old  friends,  in  Cincinnati,  Ohio. 
Mr.  Sage  took  Armand  P.  and  his  sister  Mary  on  the  road  in  an  unsuc- 
cessful juvenile  dramatic  company,  after  which  they  joined'their  mother 
in  New  York.  Subsequently,  Armand  P.  Daire  was  apprenticed  to  learn 
to  make  samples  for  wallpaper  and  carpets  in  New  York,  then  to  a 
hatter  in  Philadelphia,  later  entering  the  Five  Points  House  of  Industry. 
After  a  trip  to  Cuba  with  his  mother's  opera  company,  he  was  for  a  time 
a  student  in  a  school  maintained  by  a  French  couple,  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Racheski,  and  then  became  indentured  to  Walter  Piotrowski,  who  had 
recently  married  his  sister  Mary,  in  the  carriage  painting  trade.  His 
brother-in-law  and  his  sister  were  always  his  true  and  loyal  friends, 
never  failing  to  offer  assistance  when  needed,  ever  quick  with  sympathy 
and  understanding.  Work  in  the  printing  office  of  a  French  newspaper, 
a  tour  with  an  opera  company  in  which  he  played  small  parts  through 
the  French  West  Indies,  and  another  period  in  the  employ  of  Walter 
Piotrowski  followed.  The  Civil  War  had  been  in  progress  a  year  and 
Mr.  Daire  had  made  two  unsuccessful  efforts  to  enlist,  when,  without 
informing  his  sister  and  her  husband  of  his  intention,  he  presented 
himself  as  of  the  required  age  and  enlisted  under  the  name  of  Eugene 
Dupont,  August  11,  1862,  as  a  private  in  Company  H,  145th  Regiment, 
New  York  Volunteer  Infantry.  An  act  of  Congress  legalizing  this 
action,  which  was  resorted  to  by  so  many  patriotic  youths  unable  to 
obtain  parental  consent  to  enlistment,  causes  him  to  be  entered  in  the 
records  of  the  War  Department  as  "Armand  P.  Daire,  alias  Eugene 
Dupont,  145th  and  123rd  United  States  Volunteers."  The  145th  was  sent 
to  Washington,  then  crossed  to  Virginia,  where  it  was  attached  to  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  71 

1st  Brigade,  ist  Division,  12th  Army  Corps,  commanded  by  General 
Slocum.  He  was  in  much  of  the  important  action  of  the  war,  partici- 
pating in  the  battles  of  Chancellorsville,  Gettysburg,  Lookout  Mountain, 
Missionary  Ridge,  Resaca,  Dallas'  Gap,  Kenesaw  Mountain,  Peach  Tree 
Creek,  the  siege  of  Atlanta,  afterward  marching  with  Sherman  to  the 
sea,  in  the  siege  of  Savannah.  After  the  three  days'  fighting  at  Gettys- 
burg the  145th  Regiment  was  so  decimated  that  General  Slocum  ordered 
its  consolidation  with  the  other  New  York  regiments.  Mr.  Daire's  com- 
pany was  joined  with  Company  H,  123rd  Regiment,  and  he  was  honor- 
ably discharged  from  the  service  as  a  member  of  that  unit  in  June,  1865. 

After  leaving  the  army  he  made  his  home  for  a  time  with  his  sister 
Mary,  and,  realizing  his  lack  of  English  education,  although  he  was 
better  versed  in  French,  he  took  a  short  course  in  Payne's  Writing 
Academy  on  the  Bowery,  studying  penmanship,  spelling,  and  arithmetic. 
He  afterward  returned  to  the  stage  for  a  time,  playing  in  eastern  cities 
and  in  Canada,  working  between  theatrical  seasons  with  his  brother- 
in-law  at  the  painting  trade  and  always  finding  work  and  welcome  there 
when  a  theatrical  venture  had  failed.  Finally  he  decided  to  give  up 
his  histrionic  ambitions  and  to  sever  his  connections  with  the  theatre, 
and  made  arrangements  with  his  brother-in-law  to  learn  every  depart- 
ment of  the  carriage  painting  trade,  a  course  to  which  he  adhered  so 
closely  that  he  became  a  finished  and  expert  mechanic.  He  gained  addi- 
tional experience  in  several  other  New  York  shops  and  then  purchased  a 
carnage  painting  business  in  Newton,  Sussex  county,  New  Jersey.  He 
married  while  living  in  Newton.  The  panic  of  1873  wrecked  his  business 
and  brought  him  into  financial  difficulties,  from  which,  in  the  course  of 
time,  he  extricated  himself.  He  followed  his  trade  in  New  York  City, 
Newark,  New  Jersey,  New  Haven,  Connecticut,  Trenton,  New  Jersey, 
St.  Louis,  Missouri,  finally  locating  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey, 
his  present  home. 

For  several  years  Mr.  Daire  had  contributed  articles  on  technical 
subjects  to  "The  Hub,"  a  trade  journal  devoted  to  the  interests  of  the 
carriage  building  business,  and  had  been  well  paid  for  his  writings. 
He  had  gained  a  wide  reputation  and  acquaintance  in  the  trade  through 
this  work,  and  the  many  offers  of  positions  tendered,  combined  with  his 
own  independence  and  strong  sense  of  right,  explain  his  numerous  busi- 
ness changes.  He  traveled  for  a  time  through  New  Jersey,  New  York, 
and  Pennsylvania,  as  the  representative  of  "The  Hub,"  and  then  for  five 
or  six  years  was  on  the  road  for  the  Valentine  Varnish  Company  and 
other  leading  varnish  manufacturing  concerns. 

In  1896  Mr.  Daire  opened  a  small  carriage  repair  shop  on  Somerset 
street,  New  Brunswick,  where  he  was  joined  by  his  son,  Charles  M.,  upon 
the  completion  of  the  younger  Daire's  schooling.  Afterward,  for  a  year, 
both  were  employed  by  Mr.  Weeks,  of  Freehold,  New  Jersey,  then  with 
A.  L.  Mundy,  of  New  Brunswick,  Mr.  Daire  serving  as  manager.  When 
Mr.  Mundy  sold  his  enterprise  to  Geer  &amp;  Demott,  Mr.  Daire  and  his 
son  undertook  the  management  of  the  painting  department  under  the 
firm  name  of  Daire  &amp;  Son,  and  when,  about  a  year  later  Geer  &amp;  Demott 
went  into  bankruptcy,  Mr.  Daire,  as  trustee,  settled  the  affairs  of  the 


72  MIDDLESEX 

firm.  Following  this  he  and  his  son  broadened  their  operations  to 
include  all  departments  of  carriage  repairing  and  building,  as  well  as 
auto  repairing,  and  they  pursue  these  lines  at  the  present  time,  a  well- 
known,  dependable  firm  of  established  reputation. 

Mr.  Daire  is  a  Roman  Catholic  in  religious  faith,  although  his  religi- 
ous views  are  broad  and  tolerant.  In  politics  he  is  a  Democrat  in  national 
affairs,  and  in  local  matters  is  independent,  his  judgments  based  on  the 
merits  of  men  rather  than  of  party.  In  New  Brunswick  he  has  been 
justice  of  the  peace,  and  in  the  borough  of  Highland  Park  councilman, 
member  of  the  Board  of  Education,  and  member  of  the  Board  of  Health, 
of  which  he  has  been  twice  elected  president.  He  holds  membership 
in  the  Grand  Army  of  the  Republic. 

Armand  Piere  Daire  married  Almira  Haffner,  and  to  them  six  chil- 
dren were  born.  Two,  Raphael  and  Gertrude,  died  in  infancy,  and  those 
surviving  are:  Francis,  a  graduate  of  Princeton  College,  a  journalist  of 
Newark,  New  Jersey;  Charles  M.,  his  father's  business  partner;  Mary, 
married  George  Tailby ;  and  Eleanor,  who  married  Walter  B.  Archibald.

where  he  became  a  bookkeeper.  He  resided  there  until  July,  1861,  when 
he  enlisted  in  the  Union  army  and  served  throughout  the  war.  After 
receiving  an  honorable  discharge  from  the  army,  he  located  in  New 
Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  he  opened  a  grocery  store  and  continued 
in  successful  business  at  the  same  location  for  thirty-four  years.  He 
took  a  prominent  part  in  public  affairs,  was  a  member  of  the  State  Board 
of  Prisons,i889-r894,  and  a  member  of  the  Middlesex  County  Board  of

in  New  Brunswick,  at  No.  335  George  street,  where  he  is  building  up 
a  good  practice.

WILLIAM  PERRY  BRADLEY.— In  the  executive  office  of  the 
Raritan  Copper  Works,  William  Perry  Bradley  fills  a  position  of  broad 
responsibility.  The  Bradley  family  is  an  old  and  honored  one  in  North- 
umberlandshire,  England.  As  long  ago  as  1740  the  founder  of  this 
branch  of  the  family  in  America  came,  with  a  company  of  sturdy  pio- 
neers,  and  settled  in  Maryland,  at  Mardela  Springs. 

Perry  Weatherly  Bradley,  father,  of  William  P.  Bradley,  was  bom 
m  Mardela  Springs,  Maryland.     He  was  for  many  years  engaged  in 


74  MIDDLESEX 

the  retail  shoe  business.  He  died  in  Salisbury,  Maryland,  at  the  age  of 
seventy-six  years.  He  married  Mary  Deshiell,  of  Salisbury,  and  took 
up  his  residence  there.  Of  their  seven  children,  William  Perry  is  the 
only  one  now  living. 

William  Perry  Bradley  was  born  in  Salisbury,  Maryland,  March  20, 
1856.  He  received  his  early  education  in  the  public  schools  of  that 
quiet  old  town,  then  took  a  course  at  the  Salisbury  Academy,  an  institu- 
tion well  known  for  the  excellence  of  its  curriculum,  from  which  he 
was  graduated  at  the  age  of  nineteen  years.  After  his  graduation  he 
accepted  a  position  on  the  printing  force  of  the  local  paper,  where  he 
remained  until  1880,  when  he  went  to  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania. 
There  he  was  associated  with  the  Times  Printing  House.  He  was  with 
William  Mann  for  a  time,  but  later  returned  to  the  Times  Company. 
Upon  his  return  he  acted  as  manager  and  filled  that  position  success- 
fully until  1890,  when  he  went  to  the  Ketterlinus  Printing  House  as 
manager.  Here  he  remained  for  two  years.  His  next  change  led  him 
into  a  different  line  of  work,  as  he  became  interested  in  the  copper 
business  in  Rhode  Island.  There  he  remained  until  1899,  when  he  came 
to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  Here  he  entered  the  offices  of  the  Raritan 
Copper  Works,  first  as  foreman  of  the  shipping,  department,  and  later 
was  promoted  to  the  position  of  chief  clerk  and  cashier.  He  has  held 
this  position  ever  since,  his  fine  executive  ability  and  capacity  for  thor- 
oughness making  him  particularly  fitted  for  work  of  this  nature. 

Mr.  Bradley,  while  never  a  politician,  has  always  accepted  his  share 
of  public  responsibility  when  sought  to  that  end.  He  has  served  as 
trustee  of  the  Public  Library  here  for  five  years ;  was  president  of  the 
Board  of  Education  for  two  years ;  and  served  on  the  Harbor  Board  for

WILLIAM  E.  RAMSAY,  prominent  physician  and  surgeon  of  Perth 
Amboy,  and  one  of  the  most  widely  known  citizens  in  the  State  of  New 
Jersey,  is  a  native  of  Prince  Edward  Island,  born  November  ii,  1866. 
His  parents,  Hugh  and  Sarah  Longworth  (Lawson)  Ramsay,  were  also 
natives  of  that  island,  where  his  grandparents  were  among  the  early 
settlers,  coming  from  Scotland.  His  father  was  engaged  in  shipbuilding 
on  Prince  Edward  Island,  and  later  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where 
he  died  in  1900. 

After  preparing  for  college  in  the  Boston  High  School,  Dr.  Ramsay 
■  engaged  in  the  study  of  pharmacy  and  was  the  youngest  registered  phar- 
macist in  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  having  passed  his  examination  when 
only  fifteen  years  old.  Dr.  Ramsay  matriculated  in  the  College  of 
Physicians  and  Surgeons,  the  medical  department  of  Columbia  College 
in  New  York,  and  was  graduated  in  1888  with  the  degree  of  M.  D. 
Later,  upon  the  recommendation  of  Columbia  College  to  Johns  Hopkins 
University,  he  was  appointed  physician-in-charge  of  the  Baltimore  City 
Insane  Hospital,  during  which  time  the  State  Lunacy  Commission 
reported  to  the  governor  of  Maryland  that  never  before  had  the  insti- 
tution been  found  in  such  a  good  condition  or  the  patients  more  hu- 
manely treated.  Soon  after.  Dr.  Ramsay  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  New 
Jersey,  where  he  at  once  obtained  a  select  and  large  patronage,  along 
the  lines  of  medical  legal  work,  besides  an  extensive  private  practice. 
He  is  the  author  of  a  number  of  valuable  scientific  works. 

Dr.  Ramsay  was  health  officer  of  the  port  of  Perth  Amboy  from 
1894  to  1898.  During  the  cholera  scare  in  1893  he  was  a  special  inspector 
of  the  United  States  Marine  Hospital  Service.  In  1906  he  was  visiting 
surgeon  of  the  Perth  Amboy  City  Hospital.  Dr.  Ramsay  served  three 
terms  in  the  State  Assembly  and  while  a  member  of  that  body  was 
instrumental  in  having  passed  a  number  of  laws  tending  to  better 
sanitation  in  the  State,  among  which  may  be  cited  the  law  prohibiting 
the  common  drinking  cup.  In  1912  he  was  elected  to  the  State  Senate, 
in  which  he  served  with  distinction  for  the  ensuing  three  years,  holding 
membership  on  many  of  the  most  important  committees  of  the  Senate 
and  initiating  many  legislative  enactments  of  profound  worth  to  the 
Commonwealth  of  New  Jersey. 

In  191 5  he  resigned  from  the  Senate  to  accept  the  position  of  State 
Water  Supply  Commissioner.  In  the  same  year  he  was  appointed  sur- 
geon of  the  Perth  Amboy  division  of  the  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  and 
Pennsylvania  Railroad.  He  is  also  plant  physician  for  a  number  of 
large  industries  in  Perth  Amboy  and  vicinity. 

Dr.  Ramsay  is  an  enthusiastic  supporter  of  Federal  aid  for  State 
roads,  as  well  as  for  agricultural  protection,  and  is  interested  in  deeper 
waterways  and  for  the  proposed  Cross  State  Ship  Canal  as  a  means  to 
reduce  the  cost  of  living  by  additional  and  cheaper  transportation.  He 
has  always  been  a  contender  for  individual  liberty,  respect  for  the  law 
and  the  protection  of  the  home.  In  1920  Dr.  Ramsay  ran  for  Congress 
on  the  Democratic  ticket,  but  went  down  with  others  on  the  ticket  to 
defeat  in  the  Republican  landslide  of  that  year.

CLIFFORD  IRVING  VOORHEES.— Among  those  members  of  the 
New  Jersey  bar  who  during  the  last  decade  have  come  notably  to  the 
front,  Mr.  Voorhees,  who  is  a  representative  of  the  legal  fraternity  of 
New  Brunswick,  must  be  numbered  as  one  of  the  leaders.  He  is  also 
actively  interested  in  civic  affairs,  and  is  well  known  in  the  club  circles 
and  social  life  of  his  home  community.  New  York  City,  and  Princeton,

The  Voorhees  family,  one  of  the  oldest  in  New  Jersey,  has  been 
prominent  in  its  annals  during  the  Colonial,  Revolutionary  and  Na- 
tional periods  of  our  history.  The  name,  with  the  prefix  Van,  is  the 
Anglicized  form  of  three  Hollandish  words,  van  voor  Hees,  meaning 
from  before  the  town  of  Hees,  a  small  community  in  the  Province  of 
Drenthe,  which  was  the  native  home  of  the  family.

he  settled  on  Long  Island,  purchasing  land  in  the  town  of  Amersfoort 
en  Bergen,  now  Flatlands.  In  1664  he  was  one  of  the  magistrates  of 
that  place,  and  his  name  appears  in  1667  on  a  patent,  and  in  1675  and 
1683  on  the  assessment  rolls.  By  his  first  wife,  whose  name  is  lost,  he 
had  five  sons  and  five  daughters,  all  born  in  Holland.  The  two  who  did 
not  accompany  him  to  America  emigrated  subsequently.  In  1677  he 
and  his  second  wife  were  members  of  the  Dutch  Reformed  church  of 
Flatlands.    He  died  in  Flatlands,  February  16,  1684.

on  the  assessment  rolls  of  Flatlands.  In  1680  he  was  a  magistrate.  His 
membership  in  the  Dutch  Reformed  church  of  Flatlands  is  recorded  in

78  MIDDLESEX 

first  and  second  marriages  and  probably  by  the  third,  his  children 
numbering  sixteen,  eight  sons  and  as  many  daughters.  His  death 
occurred  in  1713.

Jersey,  and  in  early  life  went  to  New  Brunswick,  where  he  engaged  in 
the  jewelry  business,  which  he  subsequently  abandoned  for  banking 
and  finance.  For  this  sphere  of  action  he  was  especially  fitted  and  in 
it  he  soon  rose  to  prominence.  He  was  president  of  the  old  State  Bank 
of  New  Brunswick,  and  his  connection  with  the  banking  and  financial 
interests  of  the  city  was  productive  of  lasting  results  of  great  benefit 
to  the  community.  Mr.  Voorhees  was  a  public-spirited  and  highly

Barbara,  Donald,  Curtis,  and  Constance.  4.  Clifford  Irving,  mentioned 
below.  Mr.  Voorhees  died  in  New  Brunswick,  June  9,  1892,  and  his 
widow  passed  away  in  that  city,  February  9,  1909. 

(X)  Cliiford  Irving  Voorhees,  son  of  Abraham  (2)  and  Martha  J. 
(Van  Nostrand)  Voorhees,  was  born  August  4,  1884,  in  New  Brunswick, 
New  Jersey.  In  1902  he  graduated  from  the  Lawrenceville  School, 
Lawrenceville,  New  Jersey.  In  June,  1906,  he  received  from  Princeton 
University  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts.  He  was  fitted  for  his  pro- 
fession at  the  New  York  Law  School,  New  York  City,  graduating  in 
1909  with  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts.  He  also  studied  in  the  office 
of  his  brother,  the  late  Justice  Willard  P.  Voorhees,  of  the  New  Jersey 
Supreme  Court,  and  in  June,  1909,  was  admitted  to  the  New  Jersey 
bar  as  an  attorney,  and,  three  years  later,  as  a  counsellor.  Since  that 
time  Mr.  Voorhees  has  been  engaged  in  the  practice  of  his  profession 
in  his  native  city,  specializing  in  corporation  law  and  the  settlement 
of  estates.  He  is  at  the  present  time  counsel  for  a  number  of  estates 
in  New  Jersey  and  for  several  of  the  largest  industrial  plants  in  Mid- 
dlesex county. 

During  the  World  War,  in  1918,  he  served  as  associate  director  of 
and  counsel  to  the  Department  of  Personnel,  of  the  American  Red  Cross, 
at  Washington,  D.  C. 

In  politics  Mr.  Voorhees  is  a  Republican,  and,  despite  the  exacting 
demands  of  his  profession  has  found  time  to  testify  to  his  public  spirit 
by  serving  on  the  Board  of  Education.  He  is  a  member  of  the  University 
Club  of  New  York;  the  Ivy  Club  of  Princeton  University;  the  Nassau 
Club  of  Princeton ;  the  Princeton  Club  of  New  York ;  the  Union  Club

a  trustee  of  the  Francis  E.  Parker  Memorial  Home;  and  a  member  of 
the  Alumni  Council  of  Lawrenceville  School.

daughter  of  Francis  Eyre  and  Henrietta  Macaulay  Parker  (Stromberg), 
of  New  York  and  New  Brunswick,  the  former  deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Voorhees  have  three  children :  Frances  Macaulay,  born  January  30, 
1916;  Willard  Penfield,  born  January  21,  1918;  and  Clifford  Irving,  Jr., 
born  February  20,  192 1.  The  family  home,  "Rose  Bank,"  is  at  Landing 
Lane,  New  Brunswick. 

Both  as  a  lawyer  and  a  citizen  Mr.  Voorhees  has  been  true  to  the 
honorable  traditions  of  his  ancestry,  and  his  record  is  worthily  incor- 
porated in  the  history  of  the  family. 


BENJAMIN  WILLIAM  ERICKSON.— The  Erickson  family  has 
been  a  part  of  the  social  and  business  life  of  Middlesex  county.  New 
Jersey,  for  so  many  years  that  the  associations  and  interests  of  the 
various  members  of  it  are  all  centered  in  this,  their  home  section  of  the 
State. 

Born  in  Stelton,  New  Jersey,  December  9,  1882,  Benjamin  William 
Erickson  was  the  son  of  Charles  and  Sabina  Erickson,  the  former  having 


8o  MIDDLESEX 

been  a  farmer  in  this  locality  for  many  years.  Both  of  his  parents  are 
now  deceased.  After  finishing  the  course  of  study  at  the  Stelton  public 
school,  young  Erickson  entered  the  Highland  Park  school,  graduating 
in  June,  1896.  He  then  became  a  pupil  in  the  Livingston  Avenue  High 
School  of  New  Brunswick,  where  he  took  a  course  in  commercial 
branches,  from  which  he  graduated  in  June,  1897.  In  September,  1897, 
Benjamin  William  Erickson  started  upon  his  business  career  by  obtain- 
.  ing  a  position  as  ofifice  boy  in  the  Consolidated  Fruit  Jar  Company  of

with  this  company,  having  been  advanced  step  by  step,  being  elected 
a  director  of  it,  and  in  May,  1918,  was  made  secretary  and  treasurer  of 
this  widely  known  corporation  on  Water  street. 

Making  his  home  in  the  Highland  Park  section,  Mr.  Erickson  has

president  of  the  board  from  1916  to  1920.  The  work  of  the  Young 
Men's  Christian  Association  has  greatly  interested  Mr.  Erickson,  and  in 
addition  to  being  a  member  of  it,  he  is  also  on  the  board  of  directors.  He 
is  very  enthusiastic  upon  the  subject  of  fishing  and  hunting,  out-of-doors

FRANK  DORSEY,  former  mayor  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  for  many 
years  one  of  the  most  conspicuous  figures  in  the  public  and  business 
life  of  the  community  over  which  he  presided  as  chief  magistrate,  is  a 
native  of  the  city,  born  August  24,  1879.  He  is  a  member  of  a  family 
that  is  prominent  in  the  general  life  of  the  place.  His  grandfather, 
Thomas  Dorsey,  came  from  Ireland  and  settled  in  Pennsylvania  many 
years  ago.  One  of  the  sons  of  Thomas  Dorsey  was  Edward  Joseph 
Dorsey,  who  was  born  in  the  town  of  Gordon,  Pennsylvania,  and  came 
as  a  young  man  to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  resided  here  for 
forty  years,  up  to  the  time  of  his  death,  January  24,  1917.  For  thirty- 
seven  years  he  was  supervisor  of  the  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  at 
this  point  and  had  charge  of  one  hundred  and  eighty-seven  miles  of 
the  main  line  of  the  railroad.  He  married  Isabella  Dunham,  a  member 
of  an  old  Perth  Amboy  family,  where  her  birth  occurred,  and  who  sur- 
vives him.  Edward  Joseph  and  Isabella  (Dunham)  Dorsey  were  the 
parents  of  five  children,  as  follows:  Thomas  Edward,  who  resides  in 
Perth  Amboy  and  is  associated  with  Mayor  Dorsey  in  the  large  coal

and  ice  interests  of  the  place;  Frank,  with  whose  career  we  are  here 
especially  concerned;  Charles  H.,  general  agent  of  the  Lehigh  Valley 
Railroad  at  Perth  Amboy;  John  Walter,  who  is  now  engaged  in  the 
plumbing  business  in  Perth  Amboy,  married  Bessie  Bain ;  and  Isabella, 
a  teacher  in  the  Perth  Amboy  public  schools. 

The  childhood  of  Frank  Dorsey  was  passed  in  his  native  city,  where 
as  a  boy  he  attended  the  local  public  schools  for  a  time.  He  was  ex- 
tremely ambitious  to  become  established  in  business,  however,  and  at 
the  age  of  twelve  left  his  studies  and  became  a  delivery  boy  for  one  of 
the  local  butchers.  His  father  was  connected  with  the  Lehigh  Valley 
Railroad  at  that  time,  and  he  next  secured  a  position  as  messenger 
boy  for  that  corporation  and  continued  to  serve  in  that  capacity  for 
about  three  years.  At  the  close  of  the  three  years  he  went  to  Newark, 
New  Jersey,  and  attended  the  Newark  Business  College,  where  he  took 
a  four-year  commercial  course,  upon  the  completion  of  which  he  became 
associated  with  his  father  and  brother  in  a  coal  business  established  by 
the  former  in  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey.  This  concern  prospered  highly 
and  is  now  known  as  the  Dorsey-Knowles  Coal  Company,  Mr.  Dorsey 
being  its  president.  Mr.  Dorsey  has  also  become  associated  with  a 
number  of  large  commercial  concerns  in  Perth  Amboy  and  elsewhere, 
and  is  a  member  of  the  firm  of  E.  J.  Dorsey  &amp;  Sons,  dealers  in  coal 
and  ice  in  Perth  Amboy,  and  president  of  the  Dorsey-Decker  Ice  Com- 
pany of  Staten  Island.  He  is  also  president  of  the  E.  J.  Dorsey  &amp;  Sons 
Investment  Company,  prominent  dealers  in  real  state;  vice-president 
of  the  Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company,  and  a  director  and  one  of  the  organ- 
izers of  the  City  National  Bank  of  Perth  Amboy. 

Mr.  Dorsey  has  always  been  keenly  interested  in  public  aflfairs,  and 
for  a  number  of  years  has  been  prominent  in  the  ranks  of  the  Democratic 
party  in  this  section  of  the  State.  He  was  elected  mayor  of  Perth  Amboy 
in  1918  on  his  party's  ticket,  and  gave  the  city  an  efficient  and  business- 
like administration  which  won  the  approval  of  all  classes  of  citizens. 
He  is  prominent  in  social,  fraternal  and  club  circles  in  Perth  Amboy, 
and  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  serv- 
ing for  a  number  of  years  as  trustee  of  the  order,  and  for  the  past  nine 
years  has  been  past  master  in  Townley,  New  Jersey,  and  a  member  of 
the  East  Jersey  Club.  He  has  always  been  strongly  attracted  to  athletic 
sports  and  finds  particular  pleasure  in  good  boxing. 

Frank  Dorsey  was  united  in  marriage,  April  20,  1907,  with  Ethel 
Gillis,  a  native  of  Bryan,  Williams  county,  Ohio,  and  a  daughter  of 
Simeon  and  Myra  (Ball)  Gillis,  old  and  highly  respected  residents  of 
that  place  and  now  both  deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Dorsey  are  the  parents 
of  one  child,  Frank  Gillis,  born  December  20,  1908. 


C.  RAYMOND  LYONS,  one  of  the  successful  young  attorneys  of 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  a  man  who  has  already  made  a  name 
for  himself  in  the  public  life  of  this  region,  is  a  native  of  this  com- 
munity, born  December  25,  1894.    His  entire  career  has  been  interwoven

with  the  interests  of  his  birthplace,  and  to  the  advancement  and  mainte- 
nance of  those  interests  he  is  ever  steadfastly  loyal. 

James  Joseph  Lyons,  father  of  C.  Raymond  Lyons,  was  born  in 
Ireland,  near  the  city  of  Dublin,  and  lived  there  until  he  was  six  years 
of  age,  when  he  was  brought  by  his  parents  to  this  country.  Upon 
landing  in  New  York  City,  they  came  direct  to  New  Brunswick,  where 
James  Joseph  Lyons  has  since  resided,  and  it  is  here  that  he  has  carried 
on  a  successful  contracting  business  for  many  years.  He  married 
Catherine  Feeney,  who  died  in  New  Brunswick,  in  1916,  at  the  age  of 
sixty-one  years.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Lyons  have  been  born  eleven  children,

when  but  sixteen  years  of  age,  and  located  in  Kansas  where  he  carried 
on  his  profession  of  mining  and  civil  engineer  for  a  number  of  years. 
In  1881  he  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  there  made  his 
home  until  his  death,  January  21,  1914,  when  about  seventy-one  years

parents  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  He  received  his  early  edu- 
cation at  Miss  Gertrude  Smith's  private  school,  then  later  attended 
the  Dr.  Pingry  school  in  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey.  His  education  was 
completed  by  a  thorough  technical  course  in  the  Columbia  College 
School  of  Mines,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1896.  He  then  entered 
upon  the  work  of  civil  engineering  in  Perth  Amboy.  Following  a 
period  of  work  in  the  immediate  vicinity,  Mr.  Rossi  did  construction 
work  all  over  the  East,  handling  many  important  projects  at  different 
points.  Later  he  became  associated  with  the  Raritan  Hollow  and  Porus

four  years  of  age,  and  as  a  little  boy  attended  the  private  school  of 


BIOGRAPHICAL  87 

Miss  Gertrude  Smith,  where  he  gained  his  elementary  education.  Later 
he  became  a  pupil  at  the  Pingry  School  of  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey,  and 
there  was  prepared  for  college.  In  early  youth  he  had  taken  a  keen 
interest  in  chemistry  and  other  scientific  studies,  and  after  graduation 
from  the  latter  institution  in  1895  entered  the  School  of  Mines  of  Colum- 
bia University  and  was  graduated  from  there  with  the  class  of  1899  as 
a  mining  engineer.  Even  before  completing  his  education  he  had  earned 
his  first  money  during  vacations  acting  as  a  surveyor  for  C.  C.  Hom- 
mann,  at  that  time  city  surveyor  of  Perth  Amboy.  After  his  graduation, 
however,  he  secured  a  permanent  position  with  the  Perth  Amboy  Terra 
Cotta  Company  and  remained  with  that  concern  one  year.  His  next 
connection  was  with  the  National  Fireproofing  Company,  which  con- 
tinued for  a  similar  period,  when  he  undertook  the  task  of  building  the 
plant  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Chemical  Works.  Upon  the  completion  of 
the  plant  he  remained  with  the  same  concern  as  manager,  his  connection 
with  it  continuing  from  1903  to  1908.  In  the  latter  year  he  was  employed 
by  the  Roessler  &amp;  Hanslacher  Chemical  Company  in  research  work,  and 
continued  to  be  thus  occupied  for  about  two  years.  It  was  in  the  year 
1910  that  the  General  Bakelite  Company  was  incorporated  in  Perth 
Amboy,  and  Mr.  Rossi  was  asked  to  become  its  general  manager,  a  posi- 
tion which  he  accepted  and  which  he  has  continuously  held  ever  since. 
This  concern  has  flourished  greatly  up  to  the  present  time,  and  its 
growth  has  been  due  in  no  small  measure  to  the  capable  conduct  of  its 
affairs  by  Mr.  Rossi,  who  has  displayed  a  remarkable  talent  for  organ- 
ization and  executive  work  and  an  unusual  degree  of  good  business 
judgment.  Mr.  Rossi  has  also  taken  an  active  part  in  the  development 
of  the  Raritan  Trust  Company  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  is  a  director  of  that 
flourishing  financial  institution.  He  is  a  conspicuous  figure  in  the 
general  life  of  the  community,  and  is  a  member  of  a  large  number  of 
organizations  of  both  a  public  and  private  character.  During  the  five 
years  between  1910  and  1915  he  was  a  menjber  of  the  local  Board  of 
Education,  and  is  now  affiliated  with  the  Benevolent  and  Protective 
Order  of  Elks,  the  Knights  of  Columbus,  the  American  Society  for 
Testing  Materials,  the  American  Chemical  Society,  American  Institute 
of  Chemical  Engineers,  the  American  Electro  Chemical  Society,  the 
Society  of  Chemical  Industry,  the  East  Jersey  Club,  the  Colonia  Country 
Club,  and  the  Perth  Amboy  Chamber  of  Commerce,  of  which  he  has 
been  a  director.  In  his  religious  belief  he  is  a  Roman  Catholic  and 
attends  .3t.  Mary's  Church  of  that  denomination  in  Perth  Amboy.  Mr. 
Rossi  has  always  been  fond  of  out-door  athletic  sports,  and  during  his 
youth  took  particular  pleasure  in  boating.  Of  recent  years  this  has 
been  to  a  large  extent  superseded  by  golf,  of  which  he  is  at  present  an 
enthusiastic  devotee. 

Louis  Mansfield  Rossi  was  united  in  marriage,  June  8,  1907,  at 
Perth  Amboy,  with  Agnes  Geraldine  Langan,  a  native  of  that  place, 
born  April  2,  1879,  a  daughter  of  Thomas  and  Margaret  (Archer)  Lan- 
gan, both  of  whom  are  now  deceased.  Two  children  have  been  born  to 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Rossi,  as  follows:  Margaret  Archer,  born  May  13,  1908,

SAMUEL  EAKIN  SHULL. — Among  the  representative  citizens 
of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  there  is  none  better  known  than  Samuel 
Eakin  Shull,  the  distinguished  scholar  and  educator,  who  has  for  a 
quarter  of  a  century  served  as  the  efficient  superintendent  of  the  schools 
of  that  city.  Mr.  Shull  comes  of  a  good  old  Pennsylvania  family  and 
was  born  in  that  State,  January  26,  1859,  &gt;n  the  town  of  Martins  Creek. 
He  is  a  son  of  Elias  and  Margaret  (Eakin)  Shull,  the  former  a  prosper- 
ous farmer  of  Martins  Creek,  where  he  came  to  be  a  prominent  figure 
in  the  local  public  life  and  at  one  time  represented  his  district  in  the 
State  Legislature. 

The  childhood  of  Mr.  Shull  was  spent  at  his  native  place,  where  as 
a  lad  he  attended  the  local  public  schools  and  received  his  elementary 
education.  He  later  became  a  student  of  the  State  Normal  School  at 
Kutztown,  Pennsylvania,  and  still  later  studied  in  the  Blairstown  Acad- 
emy, Blairstown,  New  Jersey.  After  completing  his  preparation  for 
college  at  the  last  named  institution,  he  marticulated  at  Lafayette  Col- 


go  MIDDLESEX 

lege,  Easton,  Pennsylvania,  where  he  took  the  classical  course  and  was 
graduated  in  the  year  1886  with  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts.     In 
1908  his  alma  mater  conferred  upon  him  the  honorary  degree  of  Master 
of  Arts  in  recognition  of  his  eminent  services  in  the  cause  of  education. 
Immediately  after  graduation  from  Lafayette  College,  Mr.  ShuU  entered 
the  profession  which  has  since  formed  his  life's  work  and  for  three  years 
taught  in  the  country  schools  of  his  native  State  and  of  Alabama.    At  the 
end  of  that  time  he  was  appointed  superintendent  of  the  schools  of 
South  Easton,  Pennsylvania,  and  served  in  that  capacity  for  a  period 
of  fourteen  years.     In  the  meantime  Mr.  Shull  had  made  an  enviable 
reputation  both  as  an  educator  of  talent  and  ability  and  a  practical 
administrator,  and  in  1895  was  appointed  to  his  present  post  of  super- 
intendent of  the  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  schools.     Since  then  he 
has  devoted  himself  with  the  most  indefatigable  energy  and  singleness 
of  mind  to  the  development  and  improvement  of  the  institutions  under 
his  care,  and  it  has  been  almost  entirely  due  to  his  good  judgment  and 
skill  that  they  have  increased  so  greatly  in  size,  efficiency  and  scope  of 
usefulness.    His  active  and  effective  interest  in  the  welfare  of  the  youth 
of  Perth  Amboy  has  never  flagged,  and  his  services  in  their  behalf  well 
merited  the  general  recognition  they  have  received.    Another  manner  in 
which  he  has  contributed  to  the  same  result  has  been  through  the  influence 
he  has  exerted  upon  the  city  Public  Library  in  the  capacity  of  trustee, 
for  this  institution  has  also  benefited  highly  from  his  learning  and  good 
judgment  and  become  in  the  last  few  years  a  potent  factor  in  raising  the 
educational  and  cultural  standard  of  the  community.     Mr.  Shull  was 
also  a  member  of  the  board  of  governors  of  the  Perth  Amboy  City  Hos- 
pital, and  there  also  added  materially  to  the  debt  which  is  owed  him 
by  the  community.    Mr.  Shull  is  a  conspicuous  figure  in  the  social  and 
fraternal  life  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  is  a  member  of  Raritan  Lodge,  No. 
61,  Ancient  Free  and  Accepted  Masons;  and  of  Columbia  Lodge,  No. 
139,  Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows,  of  Easton,  Pennsylvania,  and 
has  served  as  noble  grand  in  the  latter  organization.    He  and  his  family 
are  Presbyterian  in  religious  belief  and  attend  the  First  Church  of  that 
denomination  at  Perth  Amboy. 

Samuel  Eakin  Shull  was  united  in  marriage,  August  23,  1884,  in 
Easton,  Pennsylvania,  with  Laura  Catherine  Houck,  a  daughter  of 
Amos  and  Louisa  (Meyers)  Houck,  highly  esteemed  residents  of  that 
city,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Shull  are  the  parents  of  two  children,  as  follows: 
John  Vergil,  born  September  3,  1885,  and  Margaret  Lucretia,  bom 
March  18,  1902. 


JAMES  LAWRENCE  BRAIDWOOD.— Combining  utility  and  art 
in  his  attractive  Gift  and  Art  Shop  on  Smith  street,  Perth  Amboy,  James 
Lawrence  Braidwood  turns  out  many  interesting  bits  of  work  to  beau- 
tify the  homes  of  the  city. 

The  Braidwood  family  is  of  Scottish  origin;  and  Mr.  Braidwood's 
father,  John  Braidwood,  was  born  in  Scotland,  September  14,  1824.  He 
came  to  America  alone  in  1849,  and  located  in  Philadelphia,  Pennsyl- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  91 

vania,  obtaining  employment  as  a  block  cutter.  Later,  for  a  period 
of  ten  years,  he  lived  in  Chicago,  Illinois.  He  then  changed  his  place 
of  residence  to  New  Jersey  and  located  in  New  Brunswick,  where  he 
died,  December  12,  1897,  having  passed  his  seventy-third  year.  He 
hiarried  Jane  Lawrence,  who  was  also  born  in  Scotland.  She  died  in 
Chicago.  They  were  the  parents  of  two  children,  of  whom  John  D. 
Braidwood,  now  retired,  and  living  in  California,  is  the  elder.  He  has 
two  children. 

James  Lawrence  Braidwood  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jer- 
sey, May  18,  1862.  Going  with  his  parents  to  Chicago,  in  1869,  he 
received  the  greater  portion  of  his  education  in  the  public  schools  of 
that  city.  Returning  to  the  East  in  1879,  the  family  took  up  their  resi- 
dence in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  the  young  man  went  to 
work  for  Janeway  &amp;  Company,  manufacturers  of  wall  papers.  Here  he 
remained  for  sixteen  years,  becoming  thoroughly  familiar  with  the 
business,  and  incidentally  learning  considerable  about  those  allied  lines 
of  business  which  cover  the  field  of  interior  decoration.  In  association 
with  his  father,  Mr.  Braidwood  started  in  the  block  cutting  business 
in  New  Brunswick,  in  the  Home  News  building,  but  followed  this  only 
for  three  years.  He  then  came  to  Perth  Amboy  and  opened  a  picture 
store,  making  a  specialty  of  framing.  Being  an  excellent  craftsman, 
and  possessing  fine  and  discriminating  taste,  he  has  made  a  success 
of  the  business  from  the  first.  The  modest  beginning  was  made  in  1907. 
Now  Braidwood's  Gift  and  Art  Shop,  at  No.  54  Smith  street,  is  a 
delightful  spot  to  visit,  and  specimens  of  its  work  are  on  the  walls  of 
the  finest  homes  and  public  buildings  in  this  section.  Mr.  Braidwood 
has  been  a  member  of  the  Knights  of  Pythias  for  a  great  many  years,  and 
of  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics. 

Mr.  Braidwood  married,  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  Sarah 
A.  Wood,  daughter  of  James  and  Mary  (Stevens)  Wood.  Her  father 
was  born  in  Ireland,  and  her  mother  in  England.  Both  are  now 
deceased.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Braidwood  are  the  parents  of  three  children, 
all  living :  Chester  A.,  born  September  27,  1885 ;  Ernest  S.,  born  February 
16,  1887;  Leslie  L.,  born  September  13,  1896.  Chester  A.  and  Leslie  L.

stering business;  Ernest  S.  lives  in  Somerville,  New  Jersey.  All  are

ANTHONY  GRUESSNER,  M.  D.— Anthony  Gruessner  is  the  pos- 
sessor of  a  combination  of  racial  characteristics ;  on  his  father's  side  he 
IS  of  Hungarian  ancestry,  partaking  largely  of  the  Teutonic  strain, 
while  from  his  mother's  side  he  inherits  Jewish  blood,  she  being  of 
Hebrew  extraction^ 

Jacob  John  Gruessner,  father  of  Anthony  Gruessner,  was  born  in 
Hungary,  in  1849,  but  in  after  years  he  came  to  America,  locating  in 
New  York  City,  where  he  died,  in  1905.  His  wife  was  Serena  Adler, 
born  also  m  Hungary,  in  1849.  She  is  still  living,  and  resides  in  Schenec- 
tady.   In  this  family  there  were  eight  children:  Armand;  Bella;  Anna; 


92  MIDDLESEX 

Anthony,  of  whom  further;  Albert;  Regina;  Alexander,  a  sketch  of 
whom  follows;  and  Nicholas.  While  living  in  Hungary,  Jacob  John 
Gruessner  had  been  the  proprietor  of  a  wine-producing  business  and 
continued  in  the  same  line  after  emigrating  to  the  United  States. 

Anthony  Gruessner,  son  of  Jacob  John  and  Serena  (Adler)  Gruessner, 
was  born  October  9,  1880,  in  Gyongyos,  County  of  Heves,  Hungary. 
He  attended  the  public  school  there  for  four  years,  then  entered  the 
convent  school,  taking  four  years'  training  in  the  gymnasium  attached 
to  it.  Shortly  after  this  his  family  migrated  to  this  country,  and  taking 
up  their  residence  in  New  York  City,  the  young  man  had  the  advantage 
of  four  years'  further  tuition  in  the  high  school,  following  that  with  one 
year  at  Paine's  Business  College,  in  New  York  City.  Mr.  Gruessner's 
next  step  forward  was  to  become  a  student  at  the  medical  school  of  the 
Long  Island  College  Hospital  in  Brooklyn,  from  which,  after  four  years 
of  constant  application,  he  graduated  as  Doctor  of  Medicine.  After 
graduation  he  spent  three  years  in  hospital  work  as  interne.  The  doctor 
gives  special  attention  to  surgery,  in  which  he  excels. 

During  the  World  War  Dr.  Gruessner  volunteered  for  service  and 
was  made  a  captain  in  the  medical  corps.  His  term  of  service  was  from 
August,  1917,  to  January,  1919,  and  was  confined  to  the  United  States, 
as  he  did  not  have  the  opportunity  of  going  abroad. 

Dr.  Gruessner  is  connected  with  many  organizations  in  New  Bruns- 
wick ;  in  the  way  of  business,  with  the  People's  National  Bank,  and  in 
social  relations  with  New  Brunswick  Lodge,  No.  324,  Benevolent  and 
Protective  Order  of  Elks.  His  connection  with  military  societies  is 
quite  extensive,  being  a  member  of  the  Association  of  Military  Surgeons 
of  the  United  States  of  America;  the  Society  of  American  Officers  of 
the  World  War;  and  of  the  American  Legion.  Dr.  Gruessner  is  also 
a  member  of  the  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  of  the 
County  and  State  Medical  societies,  and  of  the  American  Medical  Asso- 
ciation. 

Though  Dr.  Gruessner's  father  was  in  religious  faith  a  Roman  Catho- 
lic, and  his  mother  of  Hebraic  origin,  he  has  become  affiliated  with  the 
Magyar  Reformed  Church  of  New  Brunswick.  Dr.  Gruessner  is  un- 
married; he  maintains  an  office  at  No.  153  Somerset  street. 


ALEXANDER  GRUESSNER.— Many  of  the  patrons  of  Walker 
Brothers'  Hotel,  at  No.  4  French  street.  New  Brunswick,  have  frequently 
commented  upon  the  well  equipped  drug  store  which  occupies  a  portion 
of  the  ground  floor  of  that  building.  The  owner  of  this  pharmacy  is 
Alexander  Gruessner,  and  he  asserts  with  pride  that  it  is  the  best  in 
Middlesex  county,  taking  great  care  to  keep  it  up  to  a  high  standard. 

Alexander  Gruessner,  son  of  John  Jacob  and  Serena  (Adler)  Gruess- 
ner (q.  v.),  is  a  native  of  Hungary,  though  he  has  never  known  any  other 
country  but  America  as  a  home,  being  brought  here  while  still  an  infant. 
He  was  born  in  Hungary,  October  9,  1886.  He  received  a  good  educa- 
tion in  the  public  schools  of  New  York  City,  and  at  eighteen  years  of 
age  took  a  course  in  business  training  at  a  business  college.    After  this 


BIOGRAPHICAL  93 

he  entered  the  employ  of  the  General  Electric  Company,  of  Schenectady, 
New  York,  remaining  with  them  for  five  years.  Mr.  Gruessner  left  this 
concern  to  accept  a  position  in  a  drug  store  in  the  same  city.  Finding 
this  a  congenial  occupation,  he  studied  pharmacy,  and  two  years  later, 
in  191 1,  he  obtained  a  license  to  conduct  business  in  the  State  of  New 
Jersey.  He  settled  in  New  Brunswick,  opening  a  store  at  No.  16 
French  street,  later  removing  to  No.  143  Albany  street.  The  business 
continued  to  prosper  and  he  determined  to  open  up  a  store  in  a  larger 
field,  so  he  secured  the  present  location,  at  No.  4  French  street,  in 
August,  1920.  The  store  has  a  space  of  23x120  feet,  modern  in  every 
particular,  where  everything  in  the  drug  line  is  dispensed. 

Out-door  sports  and  athletics  generally  are  favorite  pastimes  with 
Mr.  Gruessner,  but  if  he  has  a  hobby  it  is  tennis,  and  when  business 
permits  he  may  frequently  be  found  upon  the  courts.  He  is  also  inter- 
ested in  fraternal  matters,  being  a  member  of  the  local  lodge  of  Free 
Masons,  and  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks. 

In  New  Brunswick,  February  23,  1913,  Alexander  Gruessner  and 
Esther  Schwartz  were  united  in  matrimony.  Miss  Schwartz,  daughter 
of  Herman  and  Malvina  Schwartz,  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  and  has 
always  resided  there,  her  father  being  a  cigar  manufacturer  of  that  city. 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Gruessner  have  one  child,  Mildred  Pauline,  born  April  15, 
1917.    The  family  residence  is  at  No.  129  Codwise  avenue. 


MERRITT  JOSEPH  McALINDEN,  junior  member  of  the  firm  of 
Kelly  &amp;  McAlinden,  dealers  in  plumbers'  supplies  at  No.  74  Smith  street, 
Perth  Amboy,  has  since  coming  to  this  city  identified  himself  with  her 
business  interests,  and  as  a  good  citizen  as  well  as  an  able  business  man 
he  is  ever  ready  to  cooperate  in  the  philanthropic  enterprises  of  his 
adopted  city. 

Merritt  McAlinden,  father  of  Merritt  J.  McAlinden,  was  born  in 
Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  died  in  Buffalo,  New  York,  June  30,  1906. 
In  1868  he  moved  to  the  latter  city  and  there  became  the  superintendent 
of  Hall  &amp;  Sons'  brick  factory,  which  position  he  was  holding  at  the  time 
of  his  death.  He  married  Bridget  Hendrick,  who  died  in  Buffalo,  New 
York,  May  24,  1914.  They  were  the  parents  of  six  children:  Merritt  J., 
of  further  mention ;  John  W.,  Katherine,  Evelyn,  Ethel,  Florence. 

Merritt  Joseph  McAlinden  was  born  in  Buffalo,  New  York,  December 
18,  1880,  the  son  of  Merritt  and  Bridget  (Hendrick)  McAlinden.  After 
graduating  from  the  Buffalo  Central  High  School  in  1898,  he  was

well  be  called  one  of  the  prominent  business  men  of  Perth  Amboy. 
Such  he  is  in  the  highest  sense,  for  as  a  business  man  he  has  established 


94 


MIDDLESEX 


an  unassailable  reputation  for  fair  dealing,  and  his  record  speaks  for 
itself  with  a  distinctness  not  to  be  misunderstood. 

Mr.  McAlinden  married,  September  i,  1920,  Ethel  Holman,  of  Hope- 
well, New  Jersey.

ABEL  HANSEN,  owner  of  the  great  Fords  Porcelain  Works  of 
MetuChen,  New  Jersey,  the  largest  establishment  of  its  kind  in  the  world, 
and  one  of  the  most  influential  citizens  of  Middlesex  county,  is  a  native 
of  Denmark,  his  birth  having  occurred  in  the  city  of  Copenhagen,  August 
7,  1863.  He  is  a  son  of  Hans  C.  and  Marie  (Thomsen)  Hansen,  lifelong 
residents  of  Denmark,  where  the  former  was  engaged  in  agricultural 
pursuits  and  still  resides,  although  he  has  reached  the  venerable  age  of 
eighty-eight  years.  The  elder  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Hansen  were  the  parents  of 
seven  sons  as  follows:  Thomas,  Jeppe,  Anton,  Christian,  Abel  with 
whose  career  we  are  especially  concerned ;  Marius,  and  Morris.  Of 
this  family  all  the  members  with  the  exception  of  the  Mr.  Hansen  of 
this  sketch  have  remained  in  their  native  land  and  are  today  residents 
of  Denmark. 

The  childhood  of  Abel  Hansen  was  psEsed  at  his  father's  home  in 
Copenhagen,  and  it  was  there  that  he  received  his  education,  attending 
the  local  public  schools  for  the  purpose.  He  was  graduated  from  the 
Copenhagen  High  School  with  the  class  of  1879,  and  then  served  for 
three  years  in  the  Danish  army,  rising  in  that -time  to  the  rank  of  ser- 
geant. The.  young  man  then  set  about  learning  the  manufacture  and 
baking  of  clay,  in  which  he  soon  became  1  proficient  worker.  For  nine 
years  he  worked  continuously  at  the  trade  in  Esberg,  Denmark,  and 
then,  having  perfected  himself  in  all  its  details,  came  to  the  United 
States  and  located  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  he  secured 
employment  with  the  Perth  Amboy  Terra  Cotta  Company.  After  two  and 
a  half  years  spent  with  that  concern  he  was  offered  a  better  position  with 
the  Standard  Terra  Cotta  Works  of  the  same  city  and  remained  there  for 
some  sixteen  years.  In  the  meantime,  by  dint  of  economy  and  constant 
industry,  Mr.  Hansen  had  amassed  a  sufficient  capital  to  niake  it  possible 
for  him  to  engage  in  business  on  his  own  account,  and  accordingly  in 
the  year  1906  he  established  the  Fords  Porcelain  Works  in  Perth  Amboy, 
of  which  he  has  remained  at  the  head  ever  since.  The  new  enterprise 
met  with  notable  success  from  the  outset,  and  f.'-om  Ihat  time  to  the 


96  MIDDLESEX 

present  the  business  has  grown  and  prospered,  addition  after  addition 
being  added  to  the  original  plant  until  todaj'  it  is  the  largest  Porcelain 
Washtray  Works  in  the  world.    The  great  growth  of  the  concern  and 
its  present  prosperity  under  the  management  of  Mr.  Hansen  has  been 
due  entirely  to  his  expert  knowledge  of  the  art  of  making  porcelain  and 
to  his  unusual  talent  for  business  affairs  and  his  organizing  genius.    He 
has  never  departed  from  the  high  standard  of  business  ethics  which  he 
originally  set  himself,  and  today  his  reputation  for  fair  and   honest 
dealing  and  for  the  quality  of  his  wares  and  the  service  he  accords  his 
patrons  have  given  him  a  reputation  second  to  no  industrial  house  of 
the  entire  region.     Mr.  Hansen,  besides  the  conduct  of  his  jwn  great 
business,  has  participated  most  actively  in  the  general  business  and 
commercial  life  of  the  community  in  which  he  has  elected  to  make  his 
home,  and  he  is  at  the  present  time  prominently  a.^sociated  with  several 
of  the  most  important  financial  institution?  in  Perth  Amboy.     He  is 
president  of  Fords  National  Bank,  vice-president  of  the  Raritan  Trust 
Company,  treasurer  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Building  and  Loan  Association, 
and  president  of  the  People's  Building  and  Loan  Association,  all  of 
Perth  Amboy.    He  is  president  of  the  New  Jersey  Clay  Workers'  Asso- 
ciation, and  a  member  of  the  local  lodges  of  the  Masonic  order,  the 
Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows,  and  of  some  thirty  other  organiza- 
tions, fraternal  and  otherwise.     His  clubs  are  the  New  York  Athletic, 
the  Raritan  Yacht,  and  the  East  Jersey.    He  has  also  been  exceedingly 
active  in  public  affairs,  and  for  a  time  was  a  member  of  the  Excise 
Board  of  Perth  Amboy.    During  the  World  War  he  took  part  in  various 
activities  necessitated  by  the  great  struggle,  and  served  as  food  admin- 
istrator of  this  district.  ,^y,.. 

Abel  Hansen  was  united  in  marriage,  December  21,  1896,  in  Perth 
Amboy,  with  Caroline  Broderson,  of  that  city.  They  are  the  parents  of 
four  children,  as  follows:  Harry,  a  graduate  of  Rutgers  College,  who 
met  his  death  while  serving  his  country  in  the  late  war;  Etna,  now  a 
student  in  Smith  College ;  Lynda,  also  a  student  in  Smith  College ;  and

WILLIAM  LONDON,  M.  D. — Among  the  younger  generation  of 
physicians  of  Middlesex  county  is  William  London,  who,  although  hav- 
ing been  in  private  practice  but  a  short  time,  has  already  made  a  name 
for  himself  as  a  specialist  in  children's  diseases.  Not  only  has  he  won 
the  regard  of  his  brethren  of  the  profession,  but  he  is  also  gaining  the 
confidence  of  a  large  clientele  as  well. 

William  London  was  born  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  December  27, 
1896,  the  son  of  Solomon  Bernard  and  Bertha  (Featherman)  London. 
His  father  was  born  in  New  York  City  and  is  now  engaged  in  the  whole-

Gouverneur  Hospital,  New  York  City,  he  became  resident  physician  of 
the  Pediatric  Service  of  the  New  York  Nursery  and  Child's  Hospital 
until  1920,  when  equipped  with  the  experience  gathered  in  hospital  work, 
he  came  to  his  present  location,  No.  256  State  street,  Perth  Amboy,  where 
he  has  since  remained,  limiting  his  practice  to  the  diseases  of  infants  and 
children,  and  carving  out  for  himself  a  place  in  the  front  rank  of  the 
county's  younger  physicians  and  surgeons.

DANIEL  W.  CLAYTON.— On  November  8,  191 1,  when  the  citizens 
of  Middlesex  county  elected  Daniel  W.  Clayton  to  the  office  of  surrogate 
they  chose  a  man  whom  all  knew  to  be  the  right  man  in  the  right  place. 
Fitted  for  the  position  by  nine  years  spent  in  the  surrogate's  office  as 
deputy  under  Surrogate  Peter  F.  Daly,  Mr.  Clayton's  record  needed 
no  exploitation,  as  nearly  every  man  in  Middlesex  county  could  speak, 
from  personal  experience,  of  hjs  efficient  work,  courteous  manner  and 
sympathetic  treatment  of  every  case  which  he  was  called  upon  to  meet. 

Born  September  4,  1858,  upon  his  father's  farm,  the  old  Maple  Lawn 
homestead  of  the  Clayton  family,  situated  at  Prospect  Plains  in  Monroe 
township,  Middlesex  county,  New  Jersey,  Daniel  W.  Clayton  spent 
all  the  early  years  of  his  life,  assisting  his  father  in  the  work  of  the 
farm  and  in  acquiring  an  education  in  the  old  Church  public  school 
during  the  months  between  harvest  time  and  the  planting  season. 

Upon  reaching  the  age  of  twenty-two  years,  Mr.  Clayton  gave  up 
farming  and  started  out  to  seek  employment  in  some  other  line  of 
business.  His  first  position  was  as  salesman  in  D.  C.  Perrine's  general 
store  at  Freehold,  New  Jersey,. later  becoming  bookkeeper  and  cashier. 
He  next  became  a  salesman  in  the  dress  goods  department  of  Edward 
Ridley  &amp;  Sons,  dry  goods  dealers  on  Grand  street.  New  York.  After 
gaining  considerable  experience  there,  Mr.  Clayton  came  back  to  Mid- 
dlesex county.  New  Jersey,  settling  in  South  Amboy  and  opening  a 
general  store  in  partnership  with  a  Mr.  Hulitt,  the  firm  being  known  as 
Clayton  &amp;  Hulitt.  While  engaged  in  this  business  the  death  of  the 
elder  Mr.  Clayton  necessitated  the  return  of  his  son  to  his  birthplace, 
and  rather  than  permit  the  old  Maple  Lawn  homestead  to  pass  into  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  99 

hands  of  strangers  Daniel  W.  Clayton  gave  up  his  career  and  again 
became  a  tiller  of  the  soil.  The  house  was  built  by  the  elder  Mr.  Clayton 
just  after  his  marriage  and  he  lived  there  all  his  life.  He  was  borh 
January  lo,  1826,  and  died  March  i,  1884,  at  Maple  Lawn  homestead. 
In  his  early  youth  he  had  learned  the  carpenter's  trade,  but  abandoned 
it  to  take  up  farming.  The  ancestry  of  the  Clayton  family  is  supposed 
to  be  Scotch,  two  brothers  of  that  name  having  come  to  this  country 
from  Scotland  on  the  "Mayflower." 

While  residing  at  Maple  Lawn,  Mr.  Clayton  took  an  active  interest 
in  political  affairs,  being  a  member  of  the  Democratic  party.  For  four- 
teen years  he  served  as  clerk  on  the  Board  of  Education,  that  being  the 
first  board  chosen  in  Monroe  township,  part  of  that  time  being  also 
clerk  of  the  Board  of  Freeholders,  serving  on  both  boards.  He  afterward 
became  deputy  surrogate.  In  191 1,  when  Daniel  W.  Clayton  was  a 
candidate  on  the  Democratic  ticket  for  the  office  of  surrogate,  he  was 
elected  by  a  majority  of  fifteen  hundred,  being  reelected  in  November, 
1916,  when  the  Republicans  carried  the  county  by  two  thousand.  In 
his  official  capacity  he  has  always  extended  to  those  in  search  of  infor- 
mation such  assistance  as  lay  within  his  power,  and  from  one  end  of 
the  county  to  the  other  it  is  nothing  unusual  to  hear  the  people  say 
"Go  to  Daniel  Clayton  and  he  will  tell  you." 

Mr.  Clayton  is  a  director  of  the  First  National  Bank  of  Cranbury, 
New  Jersey.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  First  Presbyterian  Church  of 
Cranbury,  being  president  of  the  board  of  trustees  of  the  church.  In 
fraternal  affairs,  Mr.  Clayton  is  as  actively  interested  as  he  is  in  politics. 
He  is  a  past  master  of  Apollo  Lodge,  No.  156,  Free  and  Accepted 
Masons,  of  Cranbury,  New  Jersey,  and  a  past  councillor  of  Cranbury 
Council,  No.  60,  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics ;  also  past 
deputy  State  councillor.  For  many  years  Mr.  Clayton  has  taken  a  lead- 
ing part  in  all  educational  matters  in  his  section  of  the  State ;  he  was  one 
of  the  founders  of  the  Middlesex  County  School  Board  Association  and 
has  been  the  treasurer  of  it  since  its  organization.  Mr.  Clayton  and 
the  various  members  of  his  family  all  reside  in  and  around  Cranbury, 
New  Jersey. 

On  November  17,  1885,  Daniel  W.  Clayton  married  Katie  J.  Apple- 
gate,  the  daughter  of  Abijah  and  Sarah  J.  Applegate,  of  New  York  City. 
Two  children  have  been  born  of  this  marriage :  i.  Bertram  S.,  proprietor 
of  a  hay,  grain  and  produce  company  at  Cranbury.  2.  Arthur  A.,  a 
farmer,  living  at  Maple  Lawn  homestead  in  Monroe  township. 


FREDERICK  CONRAD  SCHNEIDER.— About  forty  years  ago 
the  Schneider  family  returned  to  New  Brunswick  after  an  absence  of  a 
few  years  spent  in  the  State  of  Kansas.  The  father  of  this  family, 
George  Schneider,  and  the  mother,  Babetta  (Keidel)  Schneider,  were 
both  natives  of  Germany.  After  arriving  in  this  country,  they  settled 
in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  Mr.  Schneider  conducted  a 
shoe  store  for  some  time,  but  gave  it  up  when  the  family  went  to  Kansas. 
When  he  returned,  he  again  entered  the  shoe  business  and  now  has 


loo  MIDDLESEX 

a  flourishing- trade  at  No.  52  Easton  avenue.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Schneider 
are  the  parents  of  nine  children,  all  living  at  the  present  time  but  one, 
a  son  John.  The  others  are :  Charles,  Anna,  George,  Frederick  Conrad, 
of  whom  further ;  Edward ;  Elizabeth,  the  wife  of  Dr.  Morris  Farkas,  of 
Orange,  New  Jersey ;  Laura,  who  married  Garrett  Himmler ;  and  Lillian. 
All  but  Mrs.  Farkas  reside  in  New  Brunswick,  three  of  the  daughters, 
Anna,  Laura  and  Lillian,  being  school  teachers  in  that  city. 

Frederick  Conrad  Schneider,  fourth  child  of  George  and  Babetta 
(Keidel)  Schneider,  was  born  in  Phillipsburg,  Phillips  county,  Kansas, 
December  11,  1879,  but  his  stay  there  was  very  short,  as  he  was  a  mere 
baby  when  taken  to  New  Brunswick.  His  education  was  acquired  in 
the  public  school  and  in  the  high  school,  he  graduating  from  the  latter 
in  1899.  In  the  same  year  Mr.  Schneider  entered  Rutgers  College,  New 
Brunswick,  taking  the  civil  engineering  course  of  four  years,  he  gradu- 
ated from  this  college  in  1903,  receiving  the  degree  of  B.  S. 

At  this  time  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad  was  engaged  in  the  work 
of  elevating  their  roadbed  running  through  the  city  of  New  Brunswick, 
and  Mr.  Schneider  entered  the  employ  of  this  company  in  the  engi- 
neering and  constructing  department;  this  was  in  1903  and  the  young 
man  remained  with  them  until  1905,  when  he  became  instructor  in 
surveying  and  mathematics  in  Trinity  College,  Durham,  North  Carolina. 
In  the  same  year  Mr.  Schneider  received  the  appointment  of  city  engi- 
rieer  of.  New  Brunswick,  retaining  this  position  until  1912. 

Having  had  so  much  experience  in  constructional  work,  and  real- 
izing the  opportunities  for  success  in  that  line,  Mr.  Schneider  entered 
into  the  building  and  contracting  business  in  1912,  and  the  result  being 
entirely  satisfactory,  he  is  still  carrying  on  the  enterprise.  His  principal

BIOGRAPHICAL  loi 

On  February  3,  1908,  Frederick  Conrad  Schneider  was  married  to 
Ethel  May  Smalley,  the  ceremony  taking  place  in  New  Brunswick, 
which  was  also  her  birthplace.  She  is  the  daughter  of  William  and 
Emily  (Lenox)  Smalley,  both  born  in  New  Brunswick,  where  they  have 
lived  all  their  lives  and  where  their  home  is  now  located  on  a  farm  in 
the  outskirts  of  the  city.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Frederick  C.  Schneider  have  two 
children,  both  living:  Dorothea  Ethel,  born  December  5,  1909;  and 
Frederick  C,  Jr.,  born  January  12,  1913. 

JOHN  JOSEPH  CLARK  is  one  of  the  prominent  men  in  the  busi- 
ness and  public  life  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  His  father,  John 
Joseph  Clark,  was  born  in  Ireland.  While  in  that  country  he  engaged 
in  farming,  but  later  he  removed  to  Scotland  and  became  an  inspector 
in  the  sanitary  department  of  the  city  of  Dundee,  Scotland.  He  married 
Helen  Brady,  who  was  born  in  Ireland,  and  they  were  the  parents  of 
eight  children,  of  whom  Thqmas  P.,  of  Short  Hills,  New  Jersey,  and 
John  Joseph,  of  Perth  Amboy,  are  the  only  ones  now  living.  John  J. 
Clark,  Sr.,  died  in  Dundee,  Scotland,  at  the  age  of  forty-five  years,  and 
his  wife  survived  him  for  many  years,  coming  to  this  country  and 
residing  in  Perth  Amboy,  where  she  died  in  1902,  at  the  age  of  sixty- 
seven  years. 

John  Joseph  Clark  was  born  in  Dundee,  Scotland,  September  t5, 
1864.  He  received  his  education  in  the  Board  or  Government  schools 
of  that  city,  leaving  school  at  the  age  of  fourteen  to  go  to  work  as  a 
locksmith  and  bell  hanger.  This  work  he  found  less  congenial  than 
might  be  desired,  and  when  opportunity  offered  he  entered  the  linen 
industry  in  Dundee.  The  dash  and  spirit  which  he  inherited  from  his 
Irish  ancestry,  balanced  by  the  sound  common  sense  of  his  Scotch 
training,  was  a  factor  iii  his  career,  but  the  young  man  knew  that  his 
success  in  life  depended  entirely  on  himself.  So  he  forthwith  took  it 
into  his  own  hands,  and  at  the  age  of  eighteen  came  to  America.  He 
located  at  once  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  becoming  identified  with 
the  terra  cotta  industry.  He  has  been  continuously  engaged  along  this 
line  ever  since  with  the  exception  of  a  period  about  1890,  when  he  was 
in  the  service  of  the  United  States  army,  on  the  Northwestern  Frontier. 

Mr.  Clark  has  long  since  established  himself  in  the  confidence  of  his 
fellow-townsmen,  and  has  been  called  upon  to  bear  an  important  share 
in  the  city  government.  He  is  alderman  from  the  Fifth  Ward,  which 
office  he  has  held  since  1913,  his  business  ability  and  excellent  judgment 
making  his  a  sane  and  forceful  influence  in  the  deliberations  of  the 
board.  He  is  connected  with  several  fraternal  orders,  being  a  member 
of  the  Knights  of  Columbus^  the  Fraternal  Order  of  Eagles,  the  Army 
and  Navy  Union,  and  of  the  Foresters  of  America. 

Mr.  Clark  married  (first)  September  6,  1891,  Anna  PuUen,  daughter 
of  James  and  Anna  (Carroll)  PuUen.  Mrs.  Clark  was  born  in  Ireland, 
and  came  to  America  at  the  age  of  ten  years.  Her  father  died  in  Ire- 
land, and  her  mother  in  Glasgow,  Scotland.  John  Joseph  and  Anna 
(Pullen)  Clark  were  the  parents  of  one  child,  John  Carroll,  who  is  now

an  insurance  adjuster  and  broker  at  No.  49  Wall  street,  New  York  City. 
The  first  Mrs.  Clark  died  August  26,  1905.  On  August  2,  1907,  Mr. 
Clark  married  (second)  Rose  M.  Kilmurray.  The  family  have  always

HAROLD  RICHARD  SEGOINE,  although  young  in  years,  has 
already  made  a  name  for  himself  as  an  executant  which  might  well  be 
the  envy  of  a  much  older  man.  He  was  born  October  14,  1887,  at  Point 
Pleasant  Beach,  New  Jersey,  the  son  of  William  and  Frances  (Conover) 
Segoine.  His  father,  William  Segoine,  was  a  civil  engineer  and  sur- 
veyor, and  for  several  years  was  county  engineer  of  Ocean  county.  New 
Jersey.  The  elder  man  had  also  been  mayor  of  Point  Pleasant  Beach, 
and  ever  took  a  keen  and  active  interest  in  the  affairs  of  the  community, 
his  relations  to  the  public  having  always  been  an  influential  factor  in 
support  of  advancement  and  improvement.  He  died  April  5,  1919.  He 
was  a  member  of  the  East  Jersey  Proprietors,  and  was  deputy  surveyor 
of  East  Jersey;  was  also  engineer  for  the  Riparian  Commission,  and 
did  much  work  along  the  east  coast  of  New  Jersey.  The  Conover  family 
were  of  Revolutionary  stock,  the  great-grandfather  of  Harold  R.  Segoine, 
Lewis  Cowenhoven  (later  Conover),  served  under  General  Washington 
in  the  battle  of  Monmouth  as  sergeant. 

As  a  boy,  Harold  Richard  Segoine  went  through  the  public  schools 
of  his  native  place,  taking  also  the  full  course  at  the  Freehold  High 
School,  and  was  graduated  in  1904.  Having  in  the  meantime  decided 
upon  civil  engineering  as  a  profession,  he  matriculated  in  Rutgers  Col- 
lege and  four  years  later  received  from  that  institution  the  degree  of 
Bachelor  of  Science,  subsequently  identifying  himself  with  George  E.

accept  the  presidency  of  the  Highland  Park  Building  Company  and  the 
Highland  Park  Lumber  Company,  in  which  he  has  continued  up  to 
the  present  time,  1921.  In  1918,  Mr.  Segoine  was  elected  president  of 
the  Cronk  Manufacturing  Company,  woodworkers  and  box  manufactur- 
ers, in  which  capacity  he  is  still  active.  As  a  business  man  he  is  held  in 
the  highest  esteem,  it  being  his  high  sense  of  honor  and  his  ability,  as 
displayed  in  the  conduct  of  his  business  affairs,  which  has  given  him  his 
standing  in  the  city.  Mr.  Segoine  operates  the  old  homestead  farm, 
near  Freehold,  New  Jersey,  which  has  been  in  the  possession  of  the 
family  for  four  generations. 

From  1910  until  1914,  he  was  borough  engineer  for  Highland  Park, 
and  has  ever  been  highly  popular  both  as  an  official  and  a  civilian.  From

'"Milton  Preger,  lawyer  and  company  clerk,  was  a  good  runner  while 
at  Veiville  and  was  the  first  man,  as  a  runner,  to  go  to  the  shell-ridden 
stone  quarry — the  worst  place  of  them  all.  He  was  game  all  through 
and  stuck  it  out  till  we  got  out  of  the  lines.  Was  worn  out  so  was  sent 
to  the  hospital  to  recover  and  never  came  back." 

Born  in  Blossburg,  Pennsylvania,  January  12,  1887,  J.  Milton  Preger

but  his  parents  moved  to  New  York  City  when  he  was  thirteen  years 
of  age,  and  the  boy  continued  his  education  at  Public  School  No.  19

EUGENE  MASON  CLARK.— Emigration  to  America  of  members 
of  the  Clark  family  began  early  in  the  colonization  period  of  our  his-

daughter,  Lena ;  Aaron,  died  at  birth.  Mrs.  Kaufmann  died  in  1869,  at 
the  age  of  twenty-one  years,  when  her  fourth  child  was  born. 

David  John  Kaufmann,  son  of  Israel  and  Lena  (Kaufmann)  Kauf- 
mann, was  born  July  21,  1865,  in  New  York  City.  He  was  educated  in 
the  public  schools  of  New  York  City,  and  New  York  College,  from  which 
he  was  graduated  in  1883.  He  was  first  employed  by  Bissell  &amp;  Haydock, 
hardware  dealers,  accepting  the  position  of  cashier,  and  after  a  year  and 
a  half  became  a  grocery  salesman,  travelling  from  Omaha  to  San  Fran- 
cisco, subsequently  accepting  the  position  of  salesman  for  L.  F.  Hersh 
Brothers,  wholesale  grocers,  of  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey,  remaining  with 
this  latter  concern  for  fifteen  years.  In  1902,  desiring  to  establish  him- 
self in  business,  he  opened  a  small  establishment  on  the  corner  of 
State  and  Fayette  streets,  Perth  Amboy,  and  the  firm  of  Potts  &amp;  Kauf- 
mann, Incorporated,  wholesale  grocers  and  flour  merchants,  at  Nos. 
224-226  Washington  street,  Perth  Amboy,  employing  fifty-five  people 
and  doing  an  annual  business  of  $2,500,000,  is  the  outgrowth  of  that 
little  enterprise,  Mr.  Kaufmann  being  president  and  treasurer  of  this 
extensive  business.  More  than  to  any  other  one  man  this  enterprise  owes 
its  magnitude  and  prestige  to  its  president,  whose  foresight,  breadth  of 


BIOGRAPHICAL  107 

view  and  capacity  for  prompt  decision  may  be  termed  the  cornerstone 
of  this  flourishing  business. 

Mr.  Kaufmann  carries  with  him  the  suggestion  of  intense  vitality  and. 
alertness,  and  the  briefest  talk  with  him  reveals  his  ability  and  his  rare 
gift  for  managing  a  large  enterprise.  He  is  a  man  who  while  great  in 
action  is  no  less  so  in  thought.  His  magnitude  in  execution  is  equalled 
by  his  breadth  of  outlook.  He  sees  on  the  horizon  the  possibilities  of 
the  future  and  with  all  his  strength  he  labors  for  their  realization.  In 
politics  he  is  a  Republican,  but  while  never  consenting  to  hold  office  he 
always  gives  his  loyal  support  to  measures  calculated  to  benefit  the 
community  and  promote  its  rapid  and  substantial  development.  Mr. 
Kaufmann's  hobby  is  reading,  he  being  particularly  interested  in  ancient 
history.  We  have  not  said  that  Mr.  Kaufmann  is  a  good  citizen  for  that 
fact  is  self-evident,  as  he  is  steadily  and  efficiently  ministering  to  the 
advancement  of  his  community.

HERBERT  JAMES  LONG. — Progressive  in  business,  and  with  a 
chorough  understanding  of  his  particular  line  of  work,  Herbert  James 
Long  has  made  the  name  of  the  "Kompak  Water  Heater"  well  known 
throughout  the  United  States  and,  because  of  a  large  export  trade,  almost 
equally  so  in  other  countries. 

Born  in  Cleveland,  Ohio,  September  21,  1878,  Herbert  James  Long 
was  the  son  of  Albert  and  Etta  (Wilbur)  Long,  lifelong  residents  of 
Cleveland,  both  having  been  born  there.  Albert  Long,  who  was  an 
accountant  in  the  city,  died  in  1879,  ^"^  '^'s  wife,  surviving  him  for  many 
years,  died  at  her  home  in  Cleveland,  at  the  age  of  fifty-two.  They  were 
the  parents  of  four  children:  i.  Myron,  deceased.  2.  William  J.,  who 
resides  in  New  York  City.  3.  Mabel,  the  wife  of  C.  S.  Beardslee,  of 
Cleveland.    4.  Herbert  James,  of  whom  further. 

The  Long  family  is  of  English  ancestry,  the  grandfather  of  Herbert 
James  Long  coming  to  the  United  States  from  England  many  years  ago 
and  going  at  once  to  Cleveland,  establishing  his  home  there.  On  the 
maternal  side,  Mr.  Long  is  a  descendant  of  the  well  known  Wilbur 
family,  one  of  the  oldest  in  Qeveland,  the  Wilbur  homestead  being  one 
of  the  show  places  in  the  city. 

Having  attended  the  grammer  school  and  graduated  from  the  Cen- 
tral High  School  in  1896,  Herbert  James  Long  took  a  course  in  civil  engi- 
neering at  the  Case  School  of  Applied  Science.  He  then  received  the 
appointment  of  civil  engineer  for  the  city  of  Cleveland,  a  position  he  held 


BIOGRAPHICAL  109 

for  four  years.  Following  this  he  went  into  the  plumbing  business,  and 
later  became  secretary  and  treasurer  of  the  Monarch  Water  Heater 
Company  of  Pittsburgh,  remaining  with  this  concern  for  four  years.  In 
1907  Mr.  Long  came  to  New  Brunswick  to  accej)t  the  position  of  secre- 
tary and  treasurer  of  the  Empire  Foundry  Company,  and  at  the  end  of 
two  years  he  left  this  company  to  enter  into  business  for  himself,  start- 
ing in  1909  in  the  manufacture  of  water  heaters,  under  the  name  of  H.  J. 
Long.  Later  it  became  known  as  the  Long,  Landreth  &amp;  Schneider  Com- 
pany, manufacturers  of  water  heaters,  the  factory  being  located  at  No. 
226  Cleveland  avenue.  Highland  Park.  Eleven  years  after  its  founding, 
on  January  i,  1920,  the  concern  became  incorporated  under  the  laws  of 
New  Jersey,  the  corporation  name  being  the  Kompak  Company,  this 
being  the  trade  mark  of  their  chief  product,  the  "Kompak  Water  Heater." 
The  business  has  prospered  to  an  unusual  extent,  the  last  year  (1920) 
it  having  tripled  the  amount  of  the  previous  year,  in  1919  the  business 
amounting  to  $200,000,  and  in  1920,  $600,000. 

Mr.  Long  is  connected  with  several  of  the  local  organizations,  among 
them  being:  The  Rotary  Club,  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association, 
and  the  American  Gas  Association.  He  and  his  family  are  members  of 
the  Livihgston  Avenue  Baptist  Church  of  New  Brunswick.  Mr.  Long  is 
greatly  interested  in  automobiling,  that  being  his  favorite  form  of  amuse- 
ment. 

In  Cleveland,  Ohio,  September  i,  1904,  Herbert  James  Long  was  mar- 
ried to  Emilie  S.  Hessenmueller,  a  native  of  Cleveland.  She  was  the 
daughter  of  Otto  Hessenmueller,  who  is  deputy  county  treasurer,  his 
home  being  in  Cleveland.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Long  have  three  children,  all 
living:  Gertrude  E.,  born  August  15,  1905:  Karl  H.,  born  October  6, 
1907 ;  and  John  W.,  born  October  6,  1909.  Their  home  is  at  No.  235  Har-

DONALD  WELLS  REED.— From  Ashtabula,  Ohio,  came  Donald 
W.  Reed,  in  January,  1910,  and,  as  superintendent  of  the  Eastern  Coal 
Dock  Company  at  South  Amboy,  he  has  taken  a  leading  place  among 
the  men  of  his  city.  To  him  is  due  in  large  degree  the  founding  and  suc- 
cessful reception  of  the  newest  of  the  financial  institutions  of  the  county, 
the  South  Amboy  Trust  Company.  In  Ashtabula,  Ohio,  his  birthplace, 
the  family  is  well  known  through  the  connection  of  James  Reed,  Sr.,  and 
James  Reed,  Jr.,  with  the  Ashtabula  "Telegraph,"  the  elder  Reed  its 
founder,  and  the  younger  Reed  its  editor  and  owner  all  his  mature  years.

until  the  age  of  seventeen  attended  public  schools.    He  began  his  busi- 
ness career  with  M.  A.  Hanna  &amp;  Company,  iron  ore  and  coal  shippers, 
and  for  ten  years  was  in  the  employ  of  that  company,  rising  to  responsi- 
ble position.    In  January,  1910,  he  entered  upon  the  duties  of  a  new  office, 
superintendent  of  the  Eastern  Coal  Dock  Company,  of  South  Amboy, 
and  there  he  has  spent  the  past  ten  years.    He  ably  fills  the  duties  of  his 
office  and  has  won  the  abundant  goodwill  of  those  associated  with  him 
of  either  higher,  lower  or  equal  rank.    When  the  South  Amboy  Trust 
Company  was  organized,  and  on  July  i,  1919,  opened  for  business,  Donald 
W.  Reed  was  made  its  first  president  and  a  director  of  same.    The  com- 
pany has  had  a  prosperous  first  year  and  shows  wise,  conservative  man- 
agement.

BENJAMIN  GUTMANN,  M.  D.— Any  history  of  the  medical  pro- 
fession of  Middlesex  county  would  be  incomplete  without  the  name  of 
Dr.  Benjamin  Gutmann,  whose  career  as  a  physician  has  been  consist- 
ently devoted  to  the  welfare  of  his  fellow-citizens  of  New  Brunswick, 
New  Jersey,  with  a  success  achieved  by  but  few. 

Jacob  Gutmann,  father  of  Dr.  Gutmann,  was  born  in  Baden,  Ger- 
many. In  1855  he  set  out  from  Germany  in  a  small  sailing  vessel,  and 
upon  his  arrival  in  this  country  settled  in  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey, 
where  he  established  himself  in  the  dry  goods  business,  being  a  pioneer 
in  that  particular  line  of  trade.  He  married  Sophia  Edwards  Thompson, 
a  native  of  Prospect  Plains,  New  Jersey,  and  to  them  were  born  three 
children,  Benjamin  Gutmann  being  their  only  surviving  child.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Gutmann  are  both  deceased,  the  former  having  passfed  away  in  1881, 
the  latter  in  1902. 

Dr.  Benjamin  Gutmann  was  born  in  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  De- 
cember 29,  1877,  and  received  the  preliminary  portion  of  his  education  in 
the  schools  of  his  native  place.  He  then  entered  Glenwood  Collegiate 
Institute,  Matawan,  New  Jersey,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1893. 
In  the  meantime,  however,  his  attention  was  turned  forcibly  to  the  pro- 
fession of  medicine  and  he  decided  to  make  it  his  life  career.  With  this 
end  in  view,  he  matriculated  at  Jefferson  Medical  College,  from  which  he 
received  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine  in  1897,  during  which  time  he 
devoted  two  years  to  the  out-patient  surgical  service.  Immediately  after 
graduation,  he  came  to  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  he  began 
practice  and  here  continued  uninterruptedly  for  thirteen  years,  when,  in 
1913,  he  took  post-graduate  study  in  medicine  at  Vienna  and  Berlin,  Ger- 
many, later  resuming  his  practice  at  New  Brunswick.  In  1919  Dr.  Gut- 
mann received  a  certificate  from  Harvard  Graduate  School  of  Medicine. 
By  reason  of  taste  and  natural  aptitude,  he  directs  his  entire  attention  to 
internal  diseases,  and  is  in  possession  of  a  large  and  increasing  clientele. 

Dr.  Gutmann  is  a  member  of  the  American  Medical  Association,  New 
Jersey  State  Medical  Society,  Middlesex  County  Medical  Society,  medi- 
cal section  of  the  Rutgers  Club,  Society  of  Surgeons,  of  New  Jersey, 
Anglo-American  Society  of  Berlin,  American  Association  of  Vienna,  and 
the  Academy  of  Medicine  of  Northern  New  Jersey.  He  is  a  member  of 
the  Dutch  Reformed  Church  of  New  Brunswick.

Dr.  and  Mrs.  Gutmann  are  the  parents  of  four  children :  Margaret,  Eliz-

HAROLD  GILES  HOFFMAN.— To  be  the  grandson  of  an  artist, 
and  the  great-grandson  of  a  sculptor,  is  a  distinction  given  to  very  few 
in  this  world,  yet  such  is  the  good  fortune  of  Harold  Giles  Hoffman.  His 
maternal  grandfather,  James  Crawford  Thom,  was  a  noted  American 
artist  and  a  pupil  of  Edouard  Frere.  He  exhibited  his  paintings  in  Lon- 
don at  the  National  Academy  of  Design  and  at  the  International  Ex- 
hibit in  Paris,  at  this  latter  being  the  winner  of  the  gold  medal.  His 
mother's  grandfather  was  James  Thom,  a  Scotchman  by  birth,  and  a 
noted  sandstone  sculptor,  two  of  his  studies,  "Souter  Johnny,"  and  "Tarn

JOSEPH  BROGNARD  WRIGHT.— For  a  period  of  two  hundred 
years  and  more  the  record  of  the  Wright  family  has  been  a  part  of  the 
history  of  New  Jersey.  The  first  record  of  the  progenitor  of  the  family 
in  Aiperica,  Robert  Wright,  occurs  in  Wrightstown,  which  was  named 
after  the  family  at  the  time  of  William  Penn's  landing  in  this  country, 
Robert  Wright  having  come  over  with  him. 

Samuel  Gardner  Wright,  son  of  Sainuel  G.  Wright,  and  father  of  the 
subject  of  this  review,  was  born  on  the  old  farm  in  Monmouth  county, 
October  15,  1815.  Samuel  G.  Wright,  Sr.,  was  elected  to  Congress  in 
1843  from  Burlington  and  Monmouth  counties,  and  was  a  Whig.  The 
son,  Samuel  Gardner  Wright,  graduated  from  Princeton  College,  and 
was  a  farmer  all  his  life.  He  served  his  country  in  the  navy  for  nine 
years  during  the  Mexican  War,  and  was  a  master-at-arms.  He  married 
Margaret  Brognard,  granddaughter  of  Dr.  Brognard,  who  came  to  this 
country  with  Lafayette.  Mrs.  Wright  was  born  in  Watertown,  New 
York,  October  12,  1815,  and  died  in  Monmouth  county  at  the  age  of  fifty- 
two  years.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Wright  were  the  parents  of  five  children :  Ed- 
ward, deceased ;  Joseph  Brognard,  of  further  mention ;  Samuel,  deceased ; 
Eugene,  a  resident  of  Florida ;  Ida,  wife  of  Frederick  Kervan,  of  Bayside, 
Long  Island,  and  a  large  dealer  in  tropical  plants  in  New  York  City. 

Joseph  Brognard  Wright  was  born  on  the  old  farm  in  Monmouth 
county,  which  has  been  in  the  family  for  over  two  hundred  years,  Janu- 
ary 25,  1852,  and  attended  the  public  schools  of  his  native  place  until  he 
was  eighteen  years  of  age,  when  he  went  to  work  on  his  father's  farm 
and  there  continued  for  five  years  or  until  he  went  to  Philadelphia,  where 
he  became  a  salesman  for  six  years,  subsequently  coming  to  New  Bruns- 
wick, where  in  1900  he  established  himself  in  business,  first,  for  three 
years,  in  insurance  only,  then  added  real  estate,  in  which  latter  he  has 
been  very  active.  It  was  through  his  efforts  that  George  street  was 
widened  and  he  also  started  the  business  trend  to  that  thoroughfare, 
which  is  now  the  main  business  artery. 

In  politics  he  is  a  Republican  and  has  been  very  active  in  that  party. 
In  1914  he  was  a  candidate  for  mayor  on  the  Progressive  ticket.  He  is 
president  of  the  Middlesex  Auto  Club  of  New  Brunswick,  and  president 
of  the  Real  Estate  Board  of  the  city.  In  religion  he  is  a  Baptist  and 
attends  the  church  of  that  denomination  in  New  Brunswick. 

Mr.  Wright  has  always  been  one  of  the  active  factors  in  the  promo- 
tion of  anything  to  advance  the  best  interests  of  his  home  city.  He  is 
regarded  as  one  of  the  best  judges  of  property,  and  is  often  called  upon 
to  serve  as  an  appraiser  for  large  corporations  as  well  as  individuals  and 
estates. 

Mr.  Wright  married  (first)  Anna  M.  Duncan,  of  Hightstown,  New 
Jersey,  who  died  in  New  Brunswick,  in  1908.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Wright 
were  born  six  children :  Eliza  A.,  wife  of  Harry  F.  Soden,  of  Freehold, 
New  Jersey;  Emma  J.,  a  resident  of  Trenton;  Lester  C,  an  engineer  on 
the  Pennsylvania  Railroad,  married  Anna  Collins ;  Elizabetli  D.,  wife  of 
Irving  L.  Owen,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey;  Isabella  S.,  wife  of 
George  S.  Gowen,  of  East  Orange,  New  Jersey;  Oneita  M.,  wife  of

FREDERICK  F.  ANNESS.— In  July,  1900,  at  Woodbridge,  New 
Jersey,  Frederick  F.  Anness,  a  prominent  manufacturer  and  clay  miner, 
organized  the  Anness  &amp;  Potter  Fire  Clay  Company,  taking  over  the  clay 
mining  business  of  Lewis  C.  Potter.  In  1902,  in  addition  to  clay  mining, 
they  built  a  large  plant  for  the  manufacture  of  hollow  tile,  and  since  that 
time  the  firm  of  Anness  &amp;  Potter  has  enjoyed  a  large  and  growing  busi- 
ness and  now  stands  in  the  group  of  prominent  clay  miners  and  manu- 
facturers of  Middlesex  county. 

Frederick  F.  Anness  was  born  January  12,  i860,  at  Woodbridge,  New 
Jersey,  son  of  Charles  and  Adaline  (Stagg)  Anness.  Charles  Anness 
first  became  a  resident  of  Woodbridge  about  1855,  coming  here  from 
New  England.  He  conducted  a  clay  mining  business  for  a  time  at 
Woodbridge,  and  about  1864  became  a  manufacturer  of  fire  brick  at  Spa 
Spring,  part  of  Perth  Amboy,  under  the  firm  name  of  Charles  Anness  &amp; 
Sons,  the  sons,  Charles  W.  and  Samuel  I.  Anness.  About  1888  the  firm 
name  changed  and  it  became  known  as  the  Anness  &amp;  Lyle  Manufactur- 
ing Company,  with  the  following  officers:  Charles  Anness,  president; 
Robert  W.  Lyle,  vice-president  and  secretary,  and  Frederick  F.  Anness, 
treasurer  and  general  manager.  A  large  business  was  built  up,  and  their 
line  of  fire  brick,  sewer  pipe,  and  other  clay  products,  became  well  known 
to  the  trade.    In  1892  they  sold  out  to  the  Staten  Island  Clay  Company. 

Frederick  F.  Anness  was  educated  in  private  schools  at  Woodbridi^e 
and  Perth  Amboy,  and  Pennington  Seminary,  at  Penningfton,  New  Jer- 
sey. At  the  age  of  eighteen  years,  he  started  in  the  clajr  manufacturing 
business  under  his  father  and  soon  became  thoroughly  experienced  in 
this  industry,  later  becoming  superintendent  of  the  plant.  At  the  organi- 
zation of  the  Anness  &amp;  Lyle  Manufacturing  Company,  he  took  active 
part  in  its  inception  and  continued  as  its  treasurer  and  general  manager 
until  the  disposal  of  the  business  to  the  Staten  Island  Clay  Company. 
He  then  retired  from  the  clay  business  until  1900,  when  the  organiza- 
tion of  the  Anness  &amp;  Potter  Fire  Clay  Company  took  place.  The  first 
officers  of  this  new  company  were:  L.  C.  Potter,  president;  Frederick 
F.  Anness,  vice-president,  treasurer  and  general  manager,  and  Louis  E. 
Potter,  secretary.  Later  the  Potter  interests  were  purchased  by  Mr. 
Anness,  and  the  present  officers  are:  Fredefick  F.  Anness,  president 
and  treasurer,  and  James  J.  Livingood,  Jr.,  secretary.  Mr.  Livingood 
has  been  in  the  employ  of  the  company  since  1909,  and  is  now  a  stock- 
holder and  takes  an  active  part  in  the  management  of  the  manufacturing 
end  of  the  business.  Mr.  Anness  has  given  his  undivided  time  to  his 
business  and  has  not  indulged  to  any  extent  in  fraternal  or  club  circles. 
He  is  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  community  life  of  Woodbridge  and 
ever  ready  to  further  any  good  movement  for  public  benefit.    He  is  a 


ii6  MIDDLESEX 

staunch  Republican  and  abides  by  the  best  interests  of  his  part.  During 
the  World  War  he  was  active  in  the  various  war  work  campaigns  in 
which  Woodbridge  showed  itself  so  well. 

Mr.  Anness  married,  in  1887,  Mina  D.  Potter,  daughter  of  Louis  C. 
Potter,  of  Woodbridge.    Mrs.  Anness  died  August  12,  1919. 


FREDERICK  LANE  BROWN,  M.  D— Since  19 12  Dr.  Brown  has 
practiced  medicine  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  his  success  being 
most  gratifying  to  his  professional  ambition  and  to  his  many  friends.  He 
is  a  son  of  James  (2)  Brown,  grandson  of  James  (i),  and  great-grandson 
of  Samuel  Brown,  of  Scotch  ancestry,  all  of  whom  were  of  Irish  birth  of 
County  Armagh.  Samuel  Brown  was  a  farmer,  and  resided  about  forty 
miles  from  Belfast,  his  death  occurring  in  1862,  aged  seventy. 

James  (i)  Brown  was  born  at  the  homestead  in  Ireland,  August  5, 
1816,  died  at  Pluckemin,  Somerset  county.  New  Jersey,  February  20, 
1890.  He  disliked  farm  labor  and  engaged  in  milling  and  merchandising. 
He  married  in  Ireland,  and  in  June,  185 1,  he  came  to  the  United  States, 
settling  at  Pluckemin,  New  Jersey,  where  he  died  thirty-nine  years  later. 
His  wife,  Margaret  Stewart,  died  at  Pluckemin,  April  5,  1896,  in  her 
eighty-fourth  year;  she  was  a  daughter  of  Hugh  Stewart,  of  County 
Armagh,  Ireland.  James  and  Margaret  (Stewart)  Brown  were  the  par- 
ents of  seven  children :  Stewart ;  Isabella,  married  James  Chambers ; 
Margaret;  Samuel,  died  in  infancy;  James  (2),  of  further  mention; 
Anna;  and  Josiah,  who  died  at  the  age  of  thirteen  years.

was  born  in  the  County  Armagh,  in  the  North  of  Ireland,  November  28, 
1849,  '^'id  in  185 1  was  brought  to  the  United  States  by  his  parents.  He

where  the  family  settled,  and  in  April,  1869,  began  business  life  in  a 
Pluckemin  store.  In  November,  1870,  he  began  business  for  himself  in 
Pluckemin.  He  also  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  clothing  there  until 
1881,  when  he  moved  to  Somerville,  New  Jersey,  and  in  a  small  way 
manufactured  clothing.  He  prospered  from  the  first,  and  the  plant  he 
built  at  the  corner  of  Main  street  and  Doughty  avenue,  three  stories  in 
height,  soon  required  an  addition  almost  as  large  as  the  original  build- 
ing. Steady  progress  was  made  and  about  1894  the  business  was  incor- 
porated under  the  name  of  the  Somerville  Woolen  Mills,  of  which  he  was 
made  treasurer  and  general  manager.  Mr.  Brown,  during  his  active 
years,  in  addition  to  the  upbuilding  of  such  an  industry,  took  deep  inter- 
est in  political  affairs,  and  was  an  active  member  of  the  Second  Re- 
formed Church,  an  elder  and  assistant  Sunday  school  superintendent. 
Politically  he  was  a  Republican.

1880;  Frederick  Lane,  of  further  mention ;  Jennie  C,  born  August  9,  1886.

wife,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  three  children :  Gertrude,  born  June 
19,  1893;  Hugh  Stewart,  born  November  i,  1896;  and  James  Douglas.

LEONARD  MORTON  RATLIFF.— The  Ratliff  family,  of  which 
Leonard  Morton  Ratliff  is  a  member,  is  a  very  old  one  in  America,  the 
first  of  the  name  coming  to  this  country  as  early  as  1775.  They  were 
originally  Manxmen,  having  their  homes  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  that  self- 
governed  island  in  the  Irish  Sea,  just  off  the  coast  of  Great  Britain,  a 
sturdy  race  with  strong  characteristics. 

Mr.  Ratliff's  father,  John  Ratliff,  is  a  retired  farmer  and  now  lives 
at  Marion,  Indiana.  He  was  born  in  1848,  in  Henry  county,  Indiana,  and 
married  Isabelle  Larison,  who  was  born  in  1858,  at  Amboy,  Indiana,  and 
died  in  1887,  at  the  age  of  twenty-nine.  Their  children  were:  I.Leon- 
ard Morton,  of  whom  further.  2.  Ruah  May,  the  wife  of  William  Adams, 
a  farmer  living  near  Springfield,  Illinois.  3.  Myrle,  married  John  McCart- 
ney, a  garage  owner  of  Bunkerhill;  Indiana.  4.  Eurah,  wife  of  Elmer 
Ridenour,  a  farmer  of  Lagro,  Indiana.    5.  Alvah,  who  died  in  infancy. 

Leonard  Morton  Ratliff,  son  of  John  and  Isabelle  (Larison)  Ratliff, 
was  born  February  7,  1880,  at  Fairmount,  Indiana,  but  when  he  was  two 
years  old  his  family  moved  to  Amboy,  Indiana,  remaining  there  until  he 
reached  the  age  of  seven  years  when  they  again  changed  their  place  of 
residence,  going  to  Converse,  Indiana.  Here  the  boy  was  educated,  pass- 
ing through  the  various  grades  of  study  until  he  graduated  from  the  Con- 
verse High  School  at  the  age  of  sixteen  (1896).  The  young  man  then 
obtained  a  position  as  clerk  in  a  drug  store  at  Francesville,  Indiana, 
where  he  remained  for  five  years.  At  this  time  he  determined  to  take  up 
the  study  of  opthalmology  and  became  enrolled  as  a  student  at  the  Illi- 
nois College  of  Opthalmology,  completing  a  two  years'  course  in  that 


ii8  MIDDLESEX 

branch  of  treatment  in  1902.  For  the  next  few  years  Mr.  Ratliff  prac- 
ticed in  Francesville,  Indiana,  then,  deciding  to  come  East,  he  located  in 
New  Brunswick,  in  1908.  On  July  i,  1917,  he  established  an  office  at 
No.  361  George  street,  where  he  remained  until  May,  1920,  since  which 
time  he  has  been  located  at  No.  336  George  street,  his  present  address. 

While  devoted  to  his  business,  Mr.  Ratliff  finds  time  to  spend  in  rec-

CHARLES  DIPPOLT  SNEDEKER.— The  records  of  the  Holland 
Society  of  New  York,  of  which  Charles  D.  Snedeker,  of  Perth  Amboy, 
New  Jersey,  is  a  member,  show  that  he  is  a  direct  descendant  in  male 
line  from  Jan  Snedeker,  who  came  from  Holland  to  New  Amsterdam  in 
1642,  was  a  patentee  of  land  in  Flatbush,  and  one  of  the  founders  of  the 
Flatbush  Dutch  Church.  Cornelius  Snedeker,  of  this  branch  of  the  fam- 
ily, was  a  merchant  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  a  member  of  the 
Board  of  Aldermen  of  that  city,  and  a  man  of  influence  in  public,  busi- 
ness and  private  life.  He  married  Mary  Stonaker  and  among  their  chil- 
dren was  a  son  Charles  Dippolt  Snedeker,  who  for  more  than  a  quarter 
of  a  century  has  been  secretary  and  treasurer  of  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock 
Company. 

Charles  Dippolt  Snedeker  is  a  native  son  of  Middlesex  and,  with  the 
exception  of  his  early  business  training  in  New  York  City,  has  devoted 
all  his  business  life  to  the  affairs  of  the  company  named.  He  is  a  world 
traveler,  his  journeys  having  taken  him  to  all  parts  of  his  own  country, 
to  most  of  the  countries  of  Europe,  to  Egypt  and  the  Holy  land.  Public- 
spirited  and  progressive,  he  has  given  time  to  the  public  service,  and 
during  the  war  period,  1917-18,  was  a  patriotic  supporter  of  all  war 
measures  and,  through  his  corporation,  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock 
Company,  did  his  utmost  in  keeping  ships  afloat.  He  was  born  July  17, 
1861,  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  there  completed  public  school 
courses  with  high  school  graduation,  finishing  with  a  course  at  New 
Jersey  Business  College,  in  Newark.  He  began  his  business  career  as  a 
clerk  in  a  wholesale  house  in  New  York  City,  there  becoming  well 
grounded  in  business  principles  and  in  metropolitan  methods  of  manage-

ment  and  operation.  After  a  few  years  in  business  in  New  Brunswick, 
completing  his  New  York  training,  he  formed  an  association  with  the 
Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  upon  the  re- 
organization of  that  company  in  1894,  he  was  elected  to  the  position  he 
has  ever  since  held,  secretary-treasurer.  This  company  has  had  a  very 
successful  and  prosperous  life,  and  during  the  war  period  was  one  of  the 
active  agencies  in  building,  repairing  and  outfitting  American  and  allied 
vessels.  Mr.  Snedeker  has  other  business  interests  of  importance,  par- 
ticularly in  financial  institutions,  he  now  being  vice-president  and  direc- 
tor of  the  First  National  Bank  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  director  of  the  First 
National  Bank  of  Roosevelt,  New  Jersey. 

In  political  faith  Mr.  Snedeker  is  a  Democrat,  and  for  two  terms  served 
the  city  of  Perth  Amboy  as  president  of  the  Board  of  Water  Commis- 
sioners, as  member  of  the  Board  of  Health,  and  a  trustee  of  the  City 
Library.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Holland  Society  of  New  York,  a  fellow 
of  the  American  Geographical  Society,  member  of  the  New  Jersey  His- 
torical Society,  and  of  the  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Perth  Amboy. 
During  the  period  devoted  to  the  erection  of  the  present  church  edifice, 
Mr.  Snedeker  served  as  chairman  of  the  building  committee.  His  clubs 
are :  The  East  Jersey,  of  Perth  Amboy ;  Union,  of  New  Brunswick ;  and 
(Jolf,  of  Colonia,  New  Jersey.  His  favorite  recreation  or  relaxation  is 
travel,  and  he  has  catered  abundantly  to  that  particular  form  of  personal 
enjoyment.  During  the  period  of  war  with  Germany,  he  took  a  particu- 
larly deep  interest  in  the  sale  of  war  savings  stamps,  and  was  chairman 
of  the  $1,000  Club,  composed  of  men  who  subscribed  for  the  full  limit 
allowed  by  the  government  in  one  year.  He  was  engaged  with  the  cor- 
poration he  represents  in  war  work  in  their  particular  line,  and  aided  in 
the  various  drives  for  funds  and  members. 

Mr.  Snedeker  married,  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  June  23, 
1894,  Mary  Davison,  daughter  of  John  J.  Johnson  and  Sarah  (Schenck) 
Davison.  Their  only  child,  Charles  Dippolt  Snedeker,  Jr.,  died  in  infancy 
in  1896. 


CHARLES  VOORHEES  HULTS,  M.  D.— As  one  of  the  rising  phy- 
sicians of  New  Brunswick,  perhaps  none  stands  higher  in  the  public  esti- 
mation than  Dr.  Charles  Voorhees  Hults,  who  though  not  thirty  years  of 
age  has  made  for  himself  a  name  in  this  section  of  the  community  that 
might  well  be  the  envy  of  many  a  longer  established  practitioner. 

Dr.  Eugene  A.  Hults,  father  of  Dr.  Charles  Voorhees  Hults,  was  born 
in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  August  26,  1861.  Deciding  to  adopt  medi- 
cine as  his  profession,  he  matriculated  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania, 
medical  department,  and  later  at  Hahnemann  Medical  College  of  Phila- 
delphia, from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1886.  He  then  immediately 
returned  to  Perth  Amboy  and  established  himself  in  the  practice  of  his 
profession,  where  he  continued  until  his  death,  which  occurred  in  191 1. 
He  was  health  officer  for  the  city  and  port  of  Perth  Amboy  for  five  years. 
He  married  Lucy  Voorhees,  who  was  born  near  Newton,  New  Jersey, 
the  daughter  of  Charles  Voorhees,  who  also  was  born  near  Newton,  in 


I20  MIDDLESEX 

1813,  and  whose  father  in  turn  fought  in  the  Revolutionary  War.  Lucy 
Voorhees  was  the  mother  of  the  following  children:  Eugene  Arthur, 
Jr.,  formerly  president  of  a  manufacturing  concern  in  Trenton  for  drying 
machines  for  pottery,  now  general  manager  for  a  concern  at  Saltville, 
Virginia;  Sydney  E.,  public  accountant  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Willard, 
associated  with  Merck  &amp;  Company,  chemists  at  Rahway,  New  Jersey,  and 
Charles  Voorhees,  of  further  mention. 

Dr.  Charles  Voorhees  Hults,  son  of  Dr.  Eugene  A.  and  Lucy  (Voor- 
hees) Hults,  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  March  14,  1892. 
After  receiving  his  preliminary  education  in  the  public  schools  of  his 
native  place,  he  entered  the  local  high  school,  from  which  he  was  gradu- 
ated in  1910,  and  then  matriculated  at  the  New  York  Homceopathic  Medi- 
cal College,  New  York  City,  receiving  from  that  institution  the  degree  of 
Dbctor  of  Medicine  in  1914,  the  last  two  years  devoting  his  time  to  ob- 
stetrics. After  graduation,  he  served  two  years  as  interne  in  the  Metro- 
politan Hospital,  and  for  nineteen  months  was  surgeon  at  the  Reception 
Hospital,  New  York  City.  At  the  expiration  of  this  time  he  came  to 
New  Brunswick  and  at  once  entered  upon  the  general  practice  of  his  pro- 
fession, with  offices  at  No.  94  Schureman  street.  He  has  continued  here 
ever  since,  building  up  an  extensive  and  lucrative  practice,  and  steadily 
becoming  one  of  the  best  known  and  most  highly-respected  physicians  in 
this  locality. 

During  the  World  War,  Dr.  Hults  was  a  member  of  the  voluntary 
Medical  Service  Corporation.  He  is  a  member  of  Phi  Alpha  Gamma  col- 
lege fraternity.  In  religion  he  is  a  Presbyterian,  being  a  member  and 
trustee  of  the  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  New  Brunswick. 

On  January  5,  1916,  Dr.  Hults  was  united  in  marriage  with  Marion 
Louise  Potter,  daughter  of  Charles  H.  and  Mary  (Wells)  Potter.  Charles 
H.  Potter  is  president  of  the  Potter  Steamship  Company  of  New  York 
City.  In  all  out-of-door  exercises.  Dr.  Hults  is  keenly  interested,  and 
during  his  school  and  college  days  he  played  on  the  football  teams.  It  is 
hard  to  predict  the  future  of  an  already  successful  young  physician  who 
has  not  yet  reached  the  age  of  thirty,  but  his  present  record  gives  promise 
of  even  a  more  brilliant  future.  Dr.  Hults  resides  at  No.  i  Stratford 
place.  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey. 


JOHN  WALTERMAR  OLSEN,  one  of  the  most  progressive  and 
prosperous  business  men  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  he  is  presi- 
dent of  the  John  W.  Olsen  Company,  Incorporated,  is  well  known  in  this 
section  of  the  State.  The  enterprise  was  founded  by  Mr.  Olsen  in  1914, 
and  its  success  is  due  to  his  untiring  effort  and  executive  ability. 

Lauritz  Christian  Olsen,  father  of  John  Waltermar  Olsen,  was  born 
in  Copenhagen,  Denmark,  December  .23,  1857.  Later  in  life  he  came  to 
this  country  and  is  now  custodian  of  the  Middlesex  County  Vocational 
School  in  Perth  Amboy.  He  married  Anna  Peterson,  a  native  of  Copen- 
hagen. To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Olsen  have  been  born  five  children :  Peter  C, 
treasurer  and  manager  of  the  South  Amboy  Terra  Cotta  Manufacturing 
Company,  and  president  of  the  Terra  Cotta  Society  of  the  United  States ; 


BIOGRAPHICAL  121 

Fred  L.,  steamfitter  in  Easton,  Pennsylvania;  John  W.,  mentioned  be- 
low ;  Otto,  a  mason  of  Perth  Amboy ;  William,  owner  and  manager  of  an 
electrical  supply  store  in  Perth  Amboy. 

John  Waltermar  Olsen  was  born  in  Copenhagen,  Denmark,  June  17, 
1884,  the  son  of  Lauritz  C.  and  Anna  (Peterson)  Olsen.  When  five 
years  of  age  he  was  brought  by  his  mother  to  this  country.  Upon  land- 
ing in  this  country  they  came  immediately  to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey, 
where  his  father  had  arrived  seven  months  previously  and  was  then 
employed  by  the  old  Perth  Amboy  Terra  Cotta  Company.  John  W. 
Olsen  attended  the  public  schools  of  Perth  Amboy  until  he  was  fourteen 
years  of  age,  when  he  entered  upon  his  business  career.  His  first  em- 
ployment was  with  a  brick  company  in  Keasbey,  where  he  remained  for 
two  years,  subsequently  becoming  employed  by  the  C.  Pardee  Brick 
Works.  Two  years  later  he  became  identified  with  the  Raritan  Hollow 
Tile  Company,  and  was  with  this  concern  for  fourteen  years,  the  last 
seven  of  which  he  occupied  the  position  of  general  superintendent.  In 
1914  he  established  his  present  coal  business  which  is  incorporated  under 
the  name  of  the  John  W.  Olsen  Company ;  Mr.  Olsen  holding  the  office 
of  president  of  the  organization,  which  is  located  at  No.  282  Bertram  ave- 
nue, Perth  Amboy.  Not  alone  is  Mr.  Olsen  identified  with  this  enter- 
prise, for  on  April  i,  1920,  he  was  made  a  director  of  the  New  Jersey 
Coal  Dealers'  Association. 

In  everything  pertaining  to  the  welfare  and  advancement  of  his 
adopted  city,  Mr.  Olsen  takes  a  prominent  part.  He  is  affiliated  with  the 
Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  Lodge  No.  784;  the  Woodmen 
of  the  World ;  the  Royal  Arcanum,  and  the  Improved  Order  of  Red  Men. 
He  also  holds  membership  in  the  Bohemian  Club,  the  Frem  Singing 
Society,  the  Concordia  Singing  Society,  the  Raritan  Yacht  Club,  and  the 
Woodcock  Association. 

On  December  16,  1912,  Mr.  Olsen  was  united  in  marriage  with  Ma- 
thilda J.  Peterson,  daughter  of  John  and  Johanna  (Madsen)  Peterson. 
Mr.  Peterson  was  a  prominent  citizen  of  Perth  Amboy  and  died  here  in 
April,  1912.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Olsen  are  the  parents  of  two  children :  John 
Martin,  born  November  8,  1913 ;  Cornelia  Marie,  born  February  6,  1917. 


EGBERT  S.  PECK.— Son  of  Silliman  and  Louisa  (Adams)  Peck,  and 
a  descendant  of  the  ancient  and  honorable  Peck  family  of  Connecticut, 
Egbert  S.  Peck  came  rightfully  by  his  business  sagacity,  his  ancestors 
being  successful  business  men. 

Egbert  S.  Peck  was  born  near  Bethel,  Connecticut,  May  9,  1840,  and 
died  at  Saratoga  Springs,  New  York,  August  3,  1890,  after  a  very  suc- 
cessful business  career.  He  received  his  education  in  the  district  schools 
of  Connecticut,  and  when  a  young  man,  less  than  twenty  years  of  age, 
became  a  carpenter's  apprentice  and  learned  the  trade.  However,  he  did 
not  remain  long  at  this  occupation,  for  having  a  business  trend  of  mind, 
he  came  to  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  about  1868,  where  he  clerked 
for  a  time  in  one  of  the  local  shoe  stores.     He  managed  to  accumulate 


122  MIDDLESEX 

a  little  capital  and  then  embarked  in  business  for  himself,  opening  a  retail 
shoe  store  on  Church  street,  New  Brunswick.  This  enterprise  was  very- 
successful,  as  is  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  after  a  few  years  he  was  able 
to  organize  a  company  for  the  purpose  of  selling  boots  and  shoes  at 
wholesale  under  the  firm  name  of  E.  S.  Peck  &amp;  Company,  their  place  of 
business  being  on  Duane  street.  New  York  City.  He  continued  his  retail 
establishment  in  New  Brunswick,  dividing  his  time  between  the  two 
cities.  As  time  went  by  his  business  in  New  York  City  increased  to  such 
large  proportions  that  he  decided  to  dispose  of  his  retail  store  in  order  to 
devote  all  of  his  time  to  his  New  York  interests ;  this  was  about  1879. 
He  remained  on  Duane  street  until  1887,  then  having  acquired  much 
knowledge  of  the  shoe  trade  both  in  a  retail  and  wholesale  way,  he  re- 
turned to  New  Brunswick  and  with  Fletcher  and  William  S.  Felter  organ- 
ized the  Middlesex  Shoe  Company,  manufacturers  of  shoes.  In  1889  he 
purchased  the  Felter  interests  in  the  firm  and  ran  the  business  independ- 
ently until  the  time  of  his  death. 

Mr.  Peck  was  a  man  of  strong  character  and  direct  action,  realizing 
the  value  of  personal  development,  for  he,  himself,  was  once  a  poor  boy 
without  unusual  opportunities  to  assist  him.  The  fine  traits  of  his  good 
New  England  ancestors  he  inherited,  and  they  were  of  more  value  to  him 
than  worldly  goods.  By  doing  well  everything  he  attempted,  and  striv- 
ing to  succeed,  he  built  up  a  business  which  was  a  credit  to  him.  His 
integrity  won  for  him  many  friends,  both  inside  and  outside  of  his  busi- 
ness, and  his  commonwealth  was  glad  to  claim  him  as  one  of  its  front 
rank  citizens.  He  had  many  friends  outside  of  the  State,  and  in  New 
York  City  and  New  Brunswick,  where  most  of  his  activities  were,  he  was 
a  leader  in  the  business  life.  He  stood  high  in  Metuchen,  where  he  made 
his  home,  and  his  death  was  a  shock  and  a  great  loss  to  all  who  knew 
him. 

Mr.  Peck  took  a  great  interest  in  all  things  connected  with  Metuchen. 
His  interest  as  a  voter  in  local  political  matters  was  of  great  importance 
to  him,  for  he  started  with  his  vote  at  home  to  direct  the  destinies  of  the 
State  and  country.  He  was  a  strong  and  influential  Republican,  and  his 
advice  was  often  sought  in  political  matters.  Fraternally  he  was  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Masonic  order,  and  in  religious  faith  a  Presbyterian. 

Mr.  Peck  married,  October  22,  1873,  in  the  Presbyterian  church  at 
Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  Henrietta  H.  Thomas,  born  December  18,  1847, 
in  Metuchen,  daughter  of  Louis  and  Rachel  (Clarkson)  Thomas.  Louis 
Thomas  was  born  in  Woodbury,  Connecticut,  and  was  a  farmer  and 
dealer  in  properties;  his  wife,  Rachel  (Clarkson)  Thomas,  was  born  at 
Oak  Tree,  Woodbridge  township.  New  Jersey,  a  daughter  of  Joseph 
Clarkson,  one  of  the  old  settlers  near  Oak  Tree.  Three  sons  were  born 
to  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Peck :  Louis  Thomas,  born  May  19,  1875 ;  Egbert,  born 
September  10,  1878,  died  May  15,  1905;  Frederick  Clarkson,  born  April 
26,  1889.  Mrs.  Henrietta  H.  (Thomas)  Peck  yet  survives  her  husband, 
and  resides  with  her  sons  in  the  house  in  Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  built 
by  her  father,  Louis  Thomas,  in  1872.  '. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  123 

GEORGE  BROWN  RULE. — The  name  of  Rule  is  one  of  the  earliest 
of  English  names  in  America.  The  immigrant  ancestor  of  this  family 
was  sent  by  the  King  of  England  to  look  after  the  copper  interests  in 
this  territory,  and  was  invested  with  military  rank,  as  the  mining  projects 
here  were  under  the  direction  of  the  military  authorities  of  Great  Britain. 

Mr.  Rule's  father,  George  Rule,  was  born  in  New  York  City.  When 
about  two  years  of  age,  his  mother,  a  widow,  removed  to  Monmouth 
Junction,  New  Jersey,  where  he  was  bound  out  until  he  was  eighteen 
years  of  age  to  a  farmer,  John  Stout,  and  rebound  at  eighteen  to  a  man 
by  the  name  of  Steadman,  of  Princeton,  New  Jersey,  to  learn  the  carpen- 
ter's trade.  At  about  twenty-five  years  of  age  he  came  to  New  Bruns- 
wick, where  he  established  the  business  which  he  left  in  the  hands  of  his 
son  upon  his  death  in  1894.  The  location,  No.  71  John  street,  has  always 
been  the  same.  George  Rule  married  Rachel  A.  Smith,  who  was  born  in 
New  Brunswick,  and  died  in  1912.  They  were  the  parents  of  four  chil- 
dren :  George  Brown,  whose  name  heads  this  review ;  Howard  C,  who  is 
now  secretary  of  the  New  Brunswick  Savings  Institution;  John  Stout, 
who  died  at  the  age  of  seven  years;  and  Sarah  Janet,  who  makes  her 
home  with  her  brother,  George  B.  Rule. 

George  Brown  Rule  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  March  26,  1861. 
He  received  a  practical  education  in  the  public  schools  of  this  city,  con- 
tinuing his  attendance  until  he  was  sixteen  years  of  age.  He  then  began 
as  an  apprentice  in  carpenter  work,  serving  for  five  years,  thereafter 
working  as  a  journeyman  for  his  father  in  the  same  factory  which  he 
now  owns.  Taking  over  the  business  upon  his  father's  death,  he  added 
to  the  structure  which  his  father  erected,  and  now  has  the  largest  plant 
of  its  kind  in  Middlesex  county.  In  his  mill  department  he  manufactures 
sash,  doors,  etc.,  for  his  own  use  in  connection  with  his  extensive  con- 
struction operations.  Thus  he  has  been  identified  all  his  life  with  the 
building  interests  of  New  Brunswick,  and  has  erected  many  of  the  struc- 
tures which  line  the  streets  of  the  city.  Mr.  Rule  is  a  member  of  the 
Masonic  fraternity,  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics, 
the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  and  the  Union  Club.  He 
has  been  a  director  of  Middlesex  General  Hospital  for  the  past  twenty-five 
years,  member  of  executive  committee  and  member  of  house  and  grounds 
committee,  chairman  of  the  latter  for  some  twenty-five  years.  He  spends 
his  leisure  time  largely  in  motoring,  taking  an  occasional  fishing  excur- 
sion. 


HARVEY  IREDELL,  D.  D.  S.,  one  of  the  most  successful  dentists 
of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  he  has  been  active  since  1880,  is 
a  native  of  Horsham,  Pennsylvania,  his  birth  having  occurred  September 
25,  1856.  He  is  a  direct  descendant  of  the  emigrant,  Thomas  Iredell,  who 
located  at  Horsham  in  the  early  part  of  the  seventeenth  century,  having 
come  from  England. 

Harvey  Iredell  is  the  son  of  John  Barnes  and  Sarah  Ann  Iredell. 
John  Barnes  Iredell  was  born  in  Horsham,  July  16,  1832,  and  died  from 
the  result  of  an  accident,  in  Philadelphia,  at  the  age  of  sixty-five  years. 


124  MIDDLESEX 

For  twelve  years  he  was  a  school  teacher,  and  later  became  a  shoe  manu- 
facturer, which  latter  occupation  he  followed  for  the  remainder  of  his  life. 
To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Iredell  were  born  two  children:  Harvey,  mentioned 
below ;  Mary  Ella,  wife  of  Dr.  William  T.  Wyckoff,  of  Philadelphia. 

The  childhood  of  Harvey  Iredell  until  his  twelfth  year  was  passed  in 
his  native  place,  after  which  he  moved  with  his  parents  to  Philadelphia, 
where  he  continued  his  studies  in  the  schools  of  the  latter  place.  He  was 
associated  with  his  father  in  the  shoe  manufacturingf  for  three  or  four 
years.  Having  a  desire  for  a  professional  career,  he  entered  the  Phila- 
delphia Dental  College  and  was  graduated  from  this  institution  in  1880. 
He  then  went  to  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  where  he  practiced  his  profession, 
but  remained  here  for  six  months  only,  subsequently  coming  to  New 
Brunswick,  where  he  associated  himself  with  Drs.  Hull  and  Palmer  as 
an  operative  dentist,  and  filled  this  position  for  eight  years.  Then,  having 
purchased  Dr.  Palmer's  interest  in  the  firm,  he  formed  a  co-partnership 
with  Dr.  Henry  A.  Hull  and  continued  in  the  same  relationship  for  about 
eight  years,  when  he  purchased  his  partner's  interest  and  continued  the 
practice  alone  for  several  years  at  the  old  location,  afterwards  remov- 
ing to  the  National  Bank  of  New  Jersey's  new  building  when  it  was  fin- 
ished for  occupancy.  Dr.  Iredell  is  the  successor  to  the  old  practice 
which  was  formed  in  the  fifties  by  A.  D.  Newell,  who  associated  with 
him  Dr.  Edward  W.  Robbins.  Here  he  has  developed  a  large  and  high- 
class  practice,  and  is  regarded  as  among  the  leaders  of  his  profession  in 
the  county. 

In  politics  he  is  a  Republican.  He  is  also  prominent  in  the  Masonic 
organization,  having  attained  all  of  the  degrees  excepting  the  thirty- 
third,  and  afiSliated  with  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics. 
He  holds  membership  in  the  Gun  Club  of  New  Brunswick.  As  may  be 
judged  by  the  nature  of  this  club.  Dr.  Iredell  is  exceedingly  fond  of  open- 
air  life  and  to  all  pastimes  associated  with  out-of-doors.  He  greatly 
enjoys  hunting  and  fishing,  and  spen4s  much  of  his  spare  time  thus  em- 
ployed, but  his  chief  relaxation  is  gardening  and  to  this  he  devotes  some 
time  each  day. 

Dr.  Iredell  married  (first)  June  29,  1882,  Mary  Emma  Williams,  who 
died  in  New  Brunswick,  in  1898,  and  to  them  were  born  three  children : 
Alma  Hull,  wife  of  Clarence  H.  Bruce,  of  New  Brunswick ;  Russell  Wal- 
ton, an  artist  of  New  York  City ;  Albert  Williams,  a  mechanical  dentist 
of  Boston,  Massachusetts.  Dr.  Iredell  married  (second)  Bessie  Young. 
No  issue. 


WALTER  PARKER  RUNYON.— It  is  the  fate  of  the  cities  of  New 
Jersey,  fortunate  or  otherwise,  that  the  gigantic  size  and  financial  impor- 
tance of  their  great  neighbor  in  the  adjacent  State  inevitably  over- 
shadows them  and  gives  to  them  something  of  the  character  of  suburbs, 
yet  a  number  of  them  contain  industrial  interests  equal  or  superior  to 
those  that  have  given  a  national  prominence  to  other  communities  some- 
what further  removed  from  the  metropolitan  giant  of  the  New  World. 
Several  concerns  located  in  one  or  the  other  of  these  busy  and  prosper- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  125 

ous  cities,  have  arisen  to  such  size  and  importance  as  to  emerge  from  the 
general  class  of  local  enterprises  into  a  more  individual  distinction,  and 
have  become,  either  from  their  mere  dimensions  or  because  of  their  re- 
sponse to  the  particular  needs  of  the  time,  the  subjects  of  a  wider  and 
more  univeral  attention.  More  than  one  such  concern  is  to  be  found  in 
the  city  of  Perth  Amboy  and  of  these,  perhaps  the  most  notable,  is  the 
Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company,  the  present  importance  of  which  is 
largely  the  result  of  the  practical  genius  of  Walter  Parker  Runyon,  whose 
qualities  as  a  business  man  and  citizen  have  won  him  the  respect  and 
admiration  of  his  associates  and  the  community-at-large. 

Walter  Parker  Runyon  is  a  member  of  one  of  the  oldest  families  of 
New  Jersey  which  has  played  a  conspicuous  part  in  its  affairs  for  a  num- 
ber of  generations,  and  comes  of  French  Huguenot  stock,  which  has  con- 
tributed one  of  the  most  substantial  and  capable  elements  to  the  citizen- 
ship of  the  country.  The  family  was  founded  in  the  New  World  by  Vin- 
cent Rognion,  who  left  his  native  land  to  search  for  the  religious  and 
political  freedom  denied  the  Huguenots  in  France  after  the  Revocation 
of  the  Edict  of  Nantes.  This  Vincent  Rognion  settled  in  the  vicinity  of 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  from  him  is  sprung  the  numerous 
family  which  has  made  the  name  in  its  anglicized  form  so  generally 
known  in  the  State  and  elsewhere.  One  of  his  descendants,  another  Vin- 
cent Runyon,  as  the  name  had  then  come  to  be  spelled,  was  the  grand- 
father of  Walter  P.  Runyon,  and  the  founder  of  the  business  that  has 
since  grown  to  such  importance.  He  was  assisted  in  his  venture  by  his 
son,  John  Runyon,  who  afterwards  carried  it  on,  and  who  married  Anne 
Beck,  of  New  Brunswick.  They  were  the  parents  of  Walter  Parker  Run- 
yon. 

Walter  P.  Runyon  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  Decem- 
ber 3,  1861,  and  his  childhood  was  passed  in  his  native  city.  As  a  lad  he 
attended  the  public  schools  of  New  Brunswick,  and  later  the  Rutgers 
Preparatory  School,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1878.  During  his 
school  days  he  had  spent  much  of  his  time  in  the  old  shipyard  founded 
by  his  grandfather,  and  as  he  grew  to  man's  estate  became  ambitious  of 
a  business  career,  so  that  upon  completing  his  general  studies  he  entered 
the  New  Jersey  Business  College  in  order  to  prepare  himself.  He  was 
graduated  from  the  lastnamed  institution  in  1880,  and  promptly  secured 
a  clerical  position  with  the  firm  of  Fairbanks,  Martin  &amp;  Company,  woolen 
commission  merchants,  of  New  York  City.  Four  years  were  spent  by 
him  in  the  employ  of  this  concern,  during  which  time  he  became  thor- 
oughly familiar  with  general  business  methods  and  further  fitted  himself 
for  the  part  he  was  to  play  in  the  business  world.  The  two  years  follow- 
ing found  him  with  the  Metropolitan  Life  Insurance  Company  of  New 
York,  but  his  ambition  ever  urged  him  to  become  independent,  and 
accordingly  he  severed  his  connection  with  that  enormous  institution  and 
entered  into  partnership  with  the  firm  of  Vliet  &amp;  Dalmer,  manufacturing 
clothiers  of  his  native  New  Brunswick.  It  was  during  this  time  that  he 
first  became  associated  with  Charles  D.  Snedeker,  who  has  since  con- 
tmued  his  partner  in  the  great  enterprises  that  he  has  headed.    These 


126  MIDDLESEX 

two  gentlemen  were  instrumental  in  organizing  a  new  company  which 
absorbed  the  old  firm  of  Vliet  &amp;  Dalmer  soon  after  his  connection  with 
it,  and  which  met  with  a  high  degree  of  success  from  the  outset.  It  thus 
became  possible,  in  1894,  for  Mr.  Runyon  and  Mr.  Snedeker  to  purchase 
the  interest  of  the  John  Runyon  estate  in  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock 
Company,  and  shortly  afterwards  a  close  corporation  was  formed  with 
Mr.  Runyon  at  the  head,  which  took  over  the  entire  stock  of  the  old  con- 
cern. The  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company  was  at  that  time  a  com- 
paratively small  business,  but  since  then  it  has  steadily  grown  under  the 
capable  management  of  Mr.  Runyon  to  its  present  position  of  promi- 
nence. The  yard  and  its  equipment  have  been  continually  increased  to 
keep  pace  with  the  growing  business  and  now  possesses  five  balance  dry 
docks  of  10,000,  2,500,  2,000,  1,000  and  500  tons  capacity,  respectively. 
These  are  equipped  with  patent  adjustable  keel  blocks,  while  a  twenty- 
five  ton  derrick  is  in  operation  to  lift  and  transport  the  heavy  steel  struc- 
tural work  in  use  in  marine  construction.  All  needed  supplies  are  kept 
constantly  on  hand,  and  the  great  water  frontage  of  more  than  a  thou- 
sand feet,  extending  over  four  blocks,  affords  ample  pier  space  for  new 
vessels  and  those  seeking  repairs.  Machine  shops  of  the  most  modern 
type  are  maintained,  and  the  large  boiler  works  are  in  constant  operation. 
This  great  enterprise  is  still  undergoing  a  steady  expansion  and  is  already 
one  of  the  best  known  of  its  kind  along  the  Atlantic  coast.  Mr.  Runyon 
is  president  of  the  concern,  and  Mr.  Snedeker  its  treasurer. 

In  addition  to  his  own  great  business,  Mr.  Runyon  is  associated  with 
many  other  financial  and  business  interests  of  this  region  and  is  vice- 
president  of  the  Raritan  Trust  Company  and  a  director  of  the  New  Bruns- 
wick Fire  Insurance  Company,  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  the 
Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company,  of  Perth  Amboy.  His  activities  extejid 
into  other  fields  besides  business  and  connect  him  with  many  depart- 
ments of  the  communities  affairs,  and  he  is  a  member  of  many  important 
organizations  and  clubs  here  and  elsewhere.  He  is  vice-president  of  the 
Perth  Amboy  Hospital  Association,  and  a  member  of  the  National  Secur- 
ity League,  the  New  Jersey  Historical  Society,  the  United  States  Cham- 
ber of  Commerce,  the  Maritime  Association  of  the  Port  of  New  York, 
the  Manufacturers'  Association,  the  Perth  Amboy  Chamber  of  Com- 
merce, the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  of  Perth  Amboy,  of  which 
he  is  also  a  trustee ;  vice-president  of  the  Raritan  Terminal  and  Water- 
ways Association,  and  member  of  the  Society  of  Naval  Architects  and 
Marine  Engineers.  He  is  prominent  in  social,  club  and  fraternal  circles, 
and  is  a  member  of  the  Royal  Arcanum,  the  Benevolent  and  Protective 
Order  of  Elks,  the  Lake  Placid  Club,  the  East  Jersey  Club,  the  Raritan 
Yacht  Club,  and  the  Union  Club  of  New  Brunswick.  He  is  a  life  mem- 
ber of  the  National  Marine  League  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and 
a  member  of  its  board  of  trustees.  Mr.  Runyon  has  always  taken  keen 
pleasure  in  outdoor  life  of  all  kinds,  and  at  present  spends  his  leisure 
time  at  the  Lake  Placid  Club  in  the  Adirondack  Mountains  and  motors 
a  great  deal  through  that  picturesque  region.  He  is  also  fond  of  moun- 
tain climbing  and  fishing  and  engages  in  these  sports  to  a  considerable 
extent. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  127 

The  participation  of  Mr.  Runyon  in  public  affairs  in  his  home  region 
has  been  notable,  and  he  is  one  of  the  most  influential  members  of  the 
Democratic  party  in  the  State.  He  has  served  as  a  member  of  the  Demo- 
cratic executive  committee  of  New  Brunswick  and  the  Democratic  execu- 
tive committee  of  Middlesex  county.  He  was  alternate  delegate  to  the 
National  Democratic  Convention  in  1908,  and  delegate  to  the  party  con- 
vention four  years  later,  and  has  served  on  numerous  State  conventions 
during  the  past.  Mr.  Runyon  has  also  served  the  community  in  several 
official  capacities,  and  as  a  member  of  the  New  Brunswick  Water  Board 
and  the  Perth  Amboy  Water  Department  Commission  was  instrumental 
in  developing  the  fine  water  supply  now  enjoyed  by  both  cities.  In  1913 
he  was  appointed  by  Governor  Fielder,  of  New  Jersey,  a  member  of  the 
New  Jersey  State  Harbor  Commission,  and  the  following  year,  when  the 
Board  of  Commerce  and  Navigation  succeeded  to  the  older  body,  became 
a  member  thereof.  His  services  on  these  bodies  was  of  such  value  that 
when  Governor  Edge  was  elected  he  reappointed  him.  Mr.  Runyon  has 
also  represented  New  Jersey  for  some  years  at  the  annual  meetings  of  the 
Atlantic  Deeper  Waterways  Conventions.  In  1916  he  was  the  president 
of  the  New  Jersey  Wilson  Business  Men's  League. 

Walter  Parker  Runyon  was  united  in  marriage,  January  10,  1895, 
with  Katherine  Engle  Hancock,  a  daughter  of  the  Rev.  Ezekiel  Cooper 
and  Emma  Jean  (Githens)  Hancock,  of  Burlington  county.  New  Jersey. 
Mrs.  Runyon's  death  occurred  on  Christmas  Day,  December  25,  1919. 
Two  children  were  born  to  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Runyon,  as  follows :  Cooper 
Hancock,  born  September  3,  1896,  died  October  26,  1919;  and  Walter 
Parker,  Jr. 

CARL  CHRISTIAN  CHRISTENSEN.— The  record  of  a  life  begun 
on  Old  World  soil  bears  peculiar  interest.  Coming  to  this  country  when 
a  young  man,  overcoming  all  the  obstacles  which  meet  one  unfamiliar 
with  the  language  and  customs,  Carl  Christian  Christensen  has  made  a 
place  for  himself,  founded  a  home  for  his  family,  and  won  a  good  measure 
of  material  success  through  his  own  unaided  efforts. 

Christian  Christensen,  his  father,  was  an  industrious  farmer  in  Den- 
mark, and  died  when  Carl  C.  was  six  years  old.  He  married  Anna  Han- 
sen, who  was  also  born  in  Denmark  and  died  there.  They  were  the  par- 
ents of  five  children,  of  whom  three  are  living:  John  and  Mary,  who  are 
still  in  Denmark,  and  Carl  Christian,  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  who 
has  built  some  of  the  representative  structures  which  beautify  the  streets 
of  that  city. 

Carl  Christian  Christensen  was  born  in  Denmark,  October  21,  1871, 
on  his  father's  farm.  There  he  learned  the  homely  duties  about  the  place 
to  help  his  mother  in  her  struggle  with  the  world,  attending  school  until 
he  was  fourteen  years  of  agie.  He  then  learned  the  trade  of  mason  and 
carpenter,  working  steadily  and  saving  all  he  could  to  make  his  real  start 
m  Itfe.  At  eighteen  years  of  age  he  crossed  the  sea  and  came  to  America. 
He  came  alone,  and  located  at  once  in  Perth  Amboy.  Soon  he  found 
work  at  his  trade  and  threw  himself  into  the  task  of  establishing  his 


128  MIDDLESEX 

future  success.  He  realized  the  advantage  in  the  hands  of  the  man  who 
is  working  for  himself,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty-five  cut  all  his  business 
ties  and  went  into  business  on  his  own  responsibility.  The  principles  of 
industry  and  thrift  which  he  learned  as  a  lad  had  become  a  habit,  and  he 
was  quickly  seen  to  be  forging  ahead.  Thirteen  years  ago  he  built  for 
himself  a  fine  residence  at  No.  139  State  street,  where  he  still  resides.  He 
has  erected  many  of  the  important  edifices  of  Perth  Amboy,  including 
the  Danish  Lutheran  church,  the  Penn  Street  Catholic  church,  and  the 
Danish  Methodist  church. 

Mr.  Christensen  has  not  confined  his  progressive  activities  to  the 
business  world.  He  has  entered  with  the  keenest  zest  into  every  public 
interest,  ably  filling  for  five  years  a  position  on  the  local  Board  of  Edu- 
cation. He  is  director  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Savings  Institution,  and  Citi- 
zens' Building  and  Loan  Association,  and  vice-president  of  the  Perth 
Amboy  Building  and  Loan  Association.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Danish 
Lutheran  church,  and  active  in  all  its  work.  Motoring  is  his  favorite 
recreation  at  the  close  of  the  day's  business,  and  whenever  he  can  find 
time  to  spare  for  relaxation.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent  and  Pro- 
tective Order  of  Elks,  and  of  the  Dana  Society. 

Mr.  Christensen  married,  October  21,  1906,  in  Perth  Amboy,  Anna 
Hansen,  daughter  of  Nels  Hansen.  She  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  her 
father  being  a  pioneer  among  the  Danish  population  of  this  vicinity.  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Christensen  had  seven  children  and  have  lost  two.  They  are 
as  follows:  Nels,  who  is  associated  with  his  father  in  all  his  building 
operations ;  Walter,  who  holds  the  position  of  assistant  treasurer  of  the 
Perth  Amboy  Savings  Bank ;  Arnold,  manager  of  the  C.  &amp;  S.  Company, 
of  Perth  Amboy ;  Carl,  who  died  at  the  age  of  two  years ;  Annette,  who 
died  at  the  age  of  fourteen  years ;  Kathryn ;  and  Eleanor. 


JACOB  MORTIMER  KLEIN,  one  of  the  most  successful  of  the 
younger  members  of  the  bar  of  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  and  an 
influential  citizen  of  Perth  Amboy,  was  born  February  i,  1889,  in  New 
York  City,  a  son  of  Max  and  Leah  (Berman)  Klein,  the  former  a  native 
of  Bohemia  and  the  latter  of  London,  England.  The  elder  Mr.  Klein  was 
born  December  16,  1864,  and  came  to  the  United  States  when  but  six- 
teen years  of  age,  locating  in  New  York  City,  where  he  later  was  engaged 
in  business  as  a  diamond  merchant  for  twelve  years.  In  1900  he  came 
to  New  Jersey  and  since  that  time  has  made  his  home  in  Perth  Amboy, 
where  he  is  still  engaged  in  the  diamond  business.  Max  Klein  and  his 
wife  became  the  parents  of  two  children:  Jacob  Mortimer,  of  further 
mention ;  and  William  H.,  who  also  resides  in  Perth  Amboy,  but  is  en- 
gaged in  business  as  a  manufacturer  in  New  York  City. 

Jacob  Mortimer  Klein  passed  the  first  eleven  years  of  his  life  in  New 
York  City  and  while  there  attended  the  local  public  schools.  He  was 
then  brought  by  his  parents  to  live  in  Perth  Amboy,  continuing  to  attend 
the  public  schools,  and  graduating  from  the  grammar  grades  in  1903,  and 
from  the  Perth  Amboy  High  School  in  1907,  being  president  of  his  class. 
In  the  meantime  he  had  determined  upon  a  professional  career,  and  with 


BIOGRAPHICAL  129 

this  end  in  view  matriculated  in  the  New  York  Law  School,  from  which 
he  was  graduated  with  the  class  of  1910,  taking  the  degree  of  LL.  B., 
later  reading  law  in  the  office  of  Joseph  E.  Tucker,  prosecuting  attorney 
of  Middlesex  county.  The  following  year  he  was  admitted  to  the  bar  of 
New  Jersey,  and  in  191 2  began  his  law  practice  in  Perth  Amboy.  Since 
that  time  he  has  continued  in  active  practice  there  and  is  to-day  generally 
recognized  as  one  of  the  most  able  members  of  the  local  bar  and  handles 
much  important  litigation  in  and  about  Perth  Amboy.  Mr.  Klein  is  a 
Democrat  in  politics  and  has  interested  himself  actively  in  public  affairs, 
though  his  participation  in  this  line  was  interrupted  somewhat  by  his 
war  service.  In  1916  he  was  a  candidate  for  the  Democratic  nomination 
for  the  recordership  of  Perth  Amboy.  He  ran  for  the  recordership  in 
1920,  but  went  down  to  defeat  in  the  Republican  landslide  with  the  rest 
of  his  ticket.  On  December  13,  1917,  he  enlisted  in  the  national  army  at 
Fort  Thomas,  Kentucky.  He  was  quickly  promoted  from  the  ranks  to  be 
a  corporal  and  from  that  again  to  be  a  sergeant  and  then  sergeant  of  the 
first  class.  He  won  his  commission  as  second  lieutenant,  July  26,  1918, 
and  as  first  lieutenant  three  months  later.  He  was  an  officer  in  Field 
Remount  Squadron,  No.  324,  located  at  Camp  Johnston,  Jacksonville, 
Florida,  preparing  for  overseas  service  when  the  armistice  was  signed. 
He  was  honorably  discharged  from  the  service,  March  3,  1918,  returning 
immediately  to  civil  life  and  the  practice  of  his  profession.  Prominent  in 
social  and  fraternal  circles  in  Perth  Amboy,  Mr.  Klein  is  a  member  of  a 
number  of  clubs  and  other  organizations,  among  which  should  be  men- 
tioned the  local  lodge  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks, 
the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  the  Young  Men's  Hebrew  Asso- 
ciation, the  Raritan  Yacht  Club,  the  Perth  Amboy  Gun  Club,  American 
Legion,  Perth  Amboy  Post,  No.  45,  Raritan  Terminal  and  Waterways 
Association,  and  the  Perth  Amboy  Democratic  Club. 

Jacob  Mortimer  Klein  was  united  in  marriage,  December,  191 7,  with 
Agnes  Sayler,  a  native  of  Huntington,  Indiana,  and  a  daughter  of  John 
M.  and  Jennie  (Wampler)  Sayler,  highly  respected  residents  of  that 
place,  where  Mr.  Sayler  is  now  a  prominent  attorney.  Mr.  Sayler's  father 
was  judge  of  Huntington  County  Court  for  several  terms,  and  was  also 
a  member  of  Congress  from  his  district.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Klein  are  the  par- 
ents of  two  children :  Jacob  Mortimer,  Jr.,  born  October  7,  1918,  and 
Jane,  born  November  8,  1920. 


CHARLES  HENRY  DUNHAM.  D.  D.  S.-For  nearly  two  decades. 
Dr.  Dunham  has  practiced  his  profession  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey, 
locating  in  that,  the  chief  city  of  his  native  county  about  three  years' 
after  his  graduation  from  dental  college.  He  is  of  an  old  Middlesex 
county  family,  founded  in  New  England  by  John  Dunham,  and  in  Mid- 
dlesex county,  New  Jersey,  by  Benajah  Dunham,  about  1671.  Benajah 
Dunham  bom  in  1640,  married  Elizabeth  Tilson,  and  came  from  East- 
ham,  on  Cape  Cod.  He  had  but  one  son,  Edmund  Dunham,  but  through 
him  was  founded  a  very  large  and  influential  New  Jersey  family

Edmund  Dunham,  born  July  25, 1661,  in  Massachusetts,  is  best  known 
as  the  distinguished  founder  in  New  Jersey  of  the  religious  sect  known 
as  "The  Seventh  Day  Baptist  Church."  Dr.  Charles  H.  Dunham  de-

tan township,  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  April  15,  1874.  He  attended 
the  public  schools  of  his  district  and  completed  the  courses  so  thoroughly 
that  he  passed  the  New  York  State  regents  examination  most  creditably, 
receiving  a  certificate  to  that  eflFect.  He  became  associated  with  the  drug 
business  in  New  Yiork  City,  but  later  decided  to  devote  himself  to  dental 
surgery,  and  in  1896  entered  the  Philadelphia  College  of  Dentistry,

Brunswick  until  1902,  but  since  then  has  continuously  practiced  there. 
He  has  been  very  successful,  gaining  a  clientele  which  taxes  him  to 
properly  care  for  it.  He  is  modern  and  skillful,  courteous  and  con- 
siderate, his  pleasing  personality  winning  him  a  host  of  friends.  His 
religious  faith  is  that  of  the  Church  of  Christ  (Scientist).  His  club  is  the

WILLIAM  T.  AMES.— As  president  of  the  First  National  Bank,  of 
Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  Mr.  Ames  has  also  to  be  given  credit  for 
establishing,  in  his  native  village,  this  institution  of  which,  as  a  "native 
son,"  he  was  glad  to  be  the  means  of  adding  to  the  modern  benefits  of  the 
village.  Woodbridge  was  his  birthplace  and  boyhood  home,  and  he  has 
for  the  venerable  town  a  real  affection. 

William  T.  Ames,  of  English  ancestry,  father  of  the  subject  of  this 
review,  was  born  in  New  York  City,  where  he  was  a  substantial  and  suc- 
cessful business  man.  He  married  Sarah  Ayres,  and  they  were  the  par- 
ents of  William  T.  Ames,  born  in  Woodbridge,  Middlesex  county.  New 
Jersey,  February  12,  1869. 

The  son,  William  T.  Ames,  was  educated  in  the  public  schools,  finish-

began  business  life  as  messenger  with  the  National  Park  Bank  of  New 
York  City,  and  rose  through  various  promotions  to  the  position  of  pay- 
ing teller.  In  1906  he  organized  the  First  National  Bank  of  Wood- 
bridge,  of  which  he  was  elected  the  first  president.  The  First  National 
Bank  has  been  a  successful  institution  from  its  beginning,  and  its  found- 
ing and  subsequent  success  reflect  great  credit  upon  Mr.  Ames  as  organ- 
izer and  executive.  He  has  aided  in  the  development  of  his  town  in  every 
legitimate  way,  and  has  been  a  strong  factor  in  the  advance  Woodbridge 
has  made  in  recent  years. 

Mr.  Ames  served  for  two  terms  as  member  of  the  Board  of  Educa- 
tion ;  was  the  first  president  of  Sewaren  Public  Library ;  was  trustee  of

SAMUEL  BARRON  BREWSTER,  eldest  son  of  George  and  Eliza 
Case  (Barron)  Brewster,  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  March 
28,  1872,  and  was  educated  in  the  public  schools  of  that  town.  After 
serving  as  a  mercantile  clerk  for  three  years,  he  entered  in  June,  1898, 
the  grain  business,  as  a  member  of  the  firm  Cutter  &amp;  Brewster.  About 
1905  he  bought  his  partner's  interest  and  continued  alone,  under  the  firm 
name  S.  B.  Brewster,  until  1909.  He  then  admitted  his  brother,  George 
Frederick  Brewster,  to  a  partnership.  The  business  is  wholesale  and  re- 
tail dealing  in  grain,  feed,  poultry  supplies,  hay,  straw,  and  kindred  lines. 
The  original  warehouse  location,  opposite  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad 
freight  station,  was  sold  to  the  Woodbridge  Lumber  Company  in  191 6, 
when  the  Brewster  Company  moved  into  the  new  building  which  they 
had  erected  at  the  intersection  of  Main  street  and  the  Pennsylvania  rail- 
road. This  new  building,  forty  feet  front  and  one  hundred  sixty  feet 
deep,  includes  warehouse,  office  and  elevator. 

Samuel  Barron  Brewster  is  a  director  of  the  First  National  Bank  of 
Woodbridge,  a  trustee  of  the  First  Presbyterian  Church,  a  trustee  of  the 
Barron  Library,  member  of  the  Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows, 
Royal  Arcanum,  and  the  Junior  Order  United  American  Mechanics. 

Mr.  Brewster  married,  November  22,  1899,  Ada  Louise  Wagner, 
daughter  of  Jacob  Wagner,  of  Plainfield,  New  Jersey 
™J^.^""^-/f ™"  Brewster  is  descended  both  on  his  father's  and 
mother  s  side  from  old  settlers  in  Woodbridge  township.  He  is  the  sev- 
enth in  descent  from  Nathaniel  Brewster,  born  at  Plymouth  about  1620. 
This  ancestor  was  graduated  from  the  first  class  of  Harvard  in  1642.  For 
over  thirty  years  he  was  pastor  of  a  church  at  Brookhaven,  Long  Island. 


132  MIDDLESEX 

From  here,  his  descendants  moved  to  New  Windsor,  New  York.  His 
great-grandson,  Timothy  Brewster,  came  to  Woodbridge  in  1779,  and 
bought  a  farm  consisting  of  a  large  tract  of  land  bordering  on  Staten 
Island  Sound.  This  land  he  bequeathed  to  his  son,  George  Young 
Brewster. 

George  Young  Brewster  had  four  sons  and  two  daughters.  His  son, 
Ezra  Mundy  Brewster,  born  in  1823,  occupied  this  property  until 
his  death  in  1896,  when  his  son,  Henry  D.  Brewster,  inherited  the  prop- 
erty. In  1847  he  married  Letitia  V.  Brokaw,  to  whom  were  born  three 
children :  Elizabeth,  Henry  D.,  and  William.  Other  children  of  George 
Young  Brewster  were:  Catherine,  born  in  182 1 ;  Walter,  born  in  1824,

Charles,  and  Walter ;  Albert,  born  in  1830 ;  and  Greorge. 

George  Brewster,  son  of  George  Young  Brewster,  married  Eliza  Case 
Barron  in  1863,  and  their  children  are:  Sadie  Barron;  Amy  Stewart, 
who  married  Benjamin  Lander  McNulty,  April  28,  1896,  and  to  whom 
have  been  born  two  children:  Barron  Lander,  and  Carrell  Stewart; 
Louise;  Samuel  Barron;  and  George  Frederick,  who  married  Lillian 
Schatz,  of  Newark,  September  24,  1914. 

Eliza  Case  (Barron)  Brewster  is  descended  from  Ellis  Barron,  who 
came  to  Watertown,  Massachusetts,  in  1640,  from  the  county  of  Water- 
ford,  Ireland,  where  the  family  were  known  as  the  Barons  of  Burn- 
church.  A  grandson  of  this  first  Ellis  Barron,  also  named  Ellis  Barron, 
came  to  Woodbridge  about  1690.  Samuel  Barron,  father  of  Eliza  Case 
Barron,  was  a  great-grandson  of  this  Ellis  Barron. 

Samuel  Barron  was  born  in  1801  in  the  Episcopal  Rectory  in  Wood- 
bridge.  This  old  brick  house  was  built  by  his  grandfather,  the  first 
Samuel  Barron,  about  1750.  It  is  said  to  be  the  first  house  built  of  brick 
in  New  Jersey.  Though  in  business  in  Mobile  for  some  twenty  years, 
Samuel  Barron  spent  most  of  his  life  in  the  old  town,  Woodbridge,  where 
he  purchased  a  farm,  and  where  he  died  in  1870.  The  old  homestead  has 
recently  been  torn  down.  Tisdale  Terrace  and  Grove  avenue  are  streets 
which  were  originally  a  part  of  the  old  farm.  He  married,  in  1839,  Eliza 
Ann,  daughter  of  Isaac  S.  Jaques,  of  Woodbridge.  This  lady,  born  in 
1817,  is  the  oldest  resident  of  the  township.  The  children  of  this  union 
were :  Eliza  Case,  who  became  the  wife  of  George  Brewster,  and  Sarah 
Romaine,  who  married,  in  1871,  William  Henry  Cutter,  son  of  Hampton 
Cutter,  who  owned  valuable  clay  mines ;  the  children  of  this  union  were : 
Hampton,  and  Laura  Lucas.  Sarah  Romaine  (Barron)  Cutter  died  No- 
vember I,  191 1.    William  Henry  Cutter  died  September  27,  1918. 

Other  descendants  of  Ellis  Barron : 

Deacon  Joseph  Barron,  a  grandson  of  Ellis  Barron,  was  a  deacon  and 
pillar  of  the  old  Presbyterian  church  when  the  present  church  edifice  was 
erected  in  1803.  In  1800  he  erected  the  old  Barron  homestead  on  Rah- 
way  avenue,  Woodbridge,  now  occupied  by  Ernest  Boynton. 

Thomas  Barron,  son  of  Deacon  Joseph  Barron,  was  born  in  Wood- 
bridge  in  1790,  and  died  in  New  York  in  1875,  unmarried.    He  was  the

rial building  of  Belleville  brownstone,  which  very  appropriately  stands 
upon  a  corner  of  the  property  which  was  long  known  as  the  Barron  home- 
stead. . 

John  Barron,  another  son  of  Deacon  Joseph  Barron,  was  born  m 
Woodbridge  in  1792.  He  married  Mary  Conner,  of  Staten  Island.  Chil-

daughter of  the  first  Ellis  Barron.  She  married  Samuel  Warner  and  had 
three  children :  Joseph ;  John ;  and  Johanna,  who  married  Captain  Slad- 
den. 

John  Ellis  Barron,  born  in  Woodbridge,  in  1806,  was  another  great- 
grandson  of  the  first  Ellis  Barron  to  settle  in  Woodbridge.  He  married 
Mary  Potter  and  their  children  were :  Sarah  Ann,  who  married  William 
Finley ;  and  Julia  Potter,  now  living  in  Brooklyn. 

CHARLES  H.  THORN.— The  history  of  the  city  of  Perth  Amboy, 
New  Jersey,  would  be  incomplete  without  the  name  of  Charles  H.  Thorn. 
The  Thorn  family  is  a  prominent  one  in  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania. 
George  W.  Thorn,  Mr.  Thorn's  father,  was  born  in  that  city.  He  was  a 
well  known  and  highly  skilled  physician,  a  man  deeply  devoted  to  duty, 
feeling  the  greatest  sense  of  responsibility  toward  his  fellowmen.  He 
served  his  country  through  the  entire  period  of  the  Civil  War,  then 
returned  to  his  practice  in  Philadelphia,  and  died  there  at  the  age  of 
seventy  years.  He  married  Eliza  Dorsey,  who  was  also  born  in  Phila- 
delphia, and  now  resides  in  Scranton,  Pennsylvania.  She  was  born  in 
September,  1844.  They  were  the  parents  of  three  children,  all  of  whom 
are  now  living:  George,  who  is  a  resident  of  Scranton,  and  engaged  in 
railroad  interests;  Charles  H.,  whose  name  appears  at  the  head  of  this 
review ;  and  Amanda,  now  the  wife  of  Louis  Worrick,  of  Scranton,  Penn- 
sylvania. 

Charles  H.  Thorn  was  born  in  Scranton,  Pennsylvania,  June  18,  1870. 
He  attended  school  in  that  city  until  he  was  eighteen  years  of  age,  then 
went  to  work  in  the  coal  mines  to  learn  the  coal  industry,  but  remained 
there  only  three  years.  He  then  learned  the  machinist's  trade,  and  also, 
while  still  living  in  Scranton,  the  trade  of  mason  and  bricklayer.  Realiz- 
ing that  the  work  nearest  at  hand  is  not  always  the  work  in  which  a  man 
succeeds  best,  and  feeling  confidence  in  the  practical  foundation  upon 
which  he  could  fall  back,  Mr.  Thorn  struck  out  along  the  line  of  sales- 
manship. He  traveled  for  a  time,  but  found  the  work  so  much  to  his  lik- 
ing, and  his  success  so  gratifying  that  he  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  New 
Jersey,  and  established  a  real  estate  business.    This  was  in  1905,  and  Mr. 


134  MIDDLESEX 

Thorn  soon  made  himself  felt  in  the  real  estate  circles  of  the  rapidly  grow- 
ing city,  handling  some  very  interesting  deals.  For  four  years,  and  dur- 
ing the  period  of  the  World  War,  Mr.  Thorn  gave  up  his  business  en- 
tirely, and  placed  his  time  at  the  disposal  of  the  United  States  Govern- 
ment, putting  all  his  energies  into  the  arduous  activities  on  this  side 
which  so  vitally  affected  the  progress  of  the  war.  He  was  all  through 
the  Morgan  explosion,  serving  with  the  State  militia.  Mr.  Thorn's  place 
of  business  and  residence  are  at  No.  103  Gordon  street,  Perth  Amboy. 
While  deeply  interested  in  public  affairs,  Mr.  Thorn  is  not  a  party  poli- 
tician, and  always  votes  for  the  best  man.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Be- 
nevolent and  Protective  Order  of  Elks.  He  is  a  very  busy  man,  but 
spends  his  leisure,  whenever  possible,  in  the  open  air.  He  is  fond  of  all 
outdoor  sports,  particularly  camping  and  fishing. 

Mr.  Thorn  married  Ada  Randolph,  daughter  of  Edgar  and  Mary  E. 
(Cole)  Randolph.  The  Randolph  family  settled  in  Perth  Amboy  in  the 
sixteenth  century,  and  have  lived  in  the  vicinity  ever  since.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Thorn's  only  child,  Ada  Randolph,  was  born  April  14,  1908.  The 
family  are  members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church,  although  Mr. 
Thorn  was  born  a  Quaker,  and  his  family  had  been  Quakers  since  old 
Colonial  times. 


ELDON  LEON  LOBLEIN. — Following  in  the  footsteps  of  his  hon-

pleted high  school  courses  with  the  graduating  class  of  1905,  then  spent 
two  years  in  Rutgers  College.  In  1910  he  was  graduated  V.  M.  D.  at  the 
University  of  Pennsylvania,  and  the  same  year  began  the  practice  of 
veterinary  medicine  and  surgery  in  New  Brunswick,  his  office  and  resi- 
dence at  No.  177  Livingston  avenue,  and  since  his  entrance  into  practice

term  which  expired  in  1920.  In  this,  the  county  lawmaking  body,  all 
local  questions  are  considered,  and  the  records  show  that  Mr.  Loblein 
has  been  faithful  and  efficient  in  his  services.  He  is  a  member  of  Delta 
Kappa  Epsilon  fraternity,  the  K.  O.  K.  A.  Club,  the  Young  Men's  Chris-

FRANK  R.  VALENTINE.— About  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth 
century,  James  Valentine,  a  Washington  market  butcher,  left  his  native 
New  York  and  made  a  home  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey.  In  addition 
to  founding  a  home  and  giving  to  Woodbridge  a  new  family  name  he 
founded  a  business,  for  he  was  one  of  the  pioneers  in  that  great  Middle- 
sex county  industry,  the  mining  of  clay  and  the  manufacture  of  clay 
products.  In  the  fullness  of  time,  James  Valentine  passed  away,  but  his 
able  sons,  Mulford  D.  and  James  R.  Valentine,  continued  the  business 
until  they  too  passed  away.  But  a  representative  of  the  third  generation 
was  trained  for  the  work,  and  Frank  R.  Valentine,  son  of  James  R.  Val- 
entine, and  grandson  of  James  Valentine,  is  the  able  executive  head  of 
the  business  conducted  under  the  corporate  name,  The  M.  D.  Valentine 
&amp;  Brother  Company,  a  name  known  wherever  fire  brick  are  used.  The 
gfreat  development  of  the  business  came  after  1870,  under  Mulford  D. 
and  James  R.  Valentine,  they  trading  as  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother,  and 
under  his  honored  uncle  and  father,  Frank  R.  Valentine  received  the 
training  which  so  well  fits  him  for  the  important  place  he  fills  in  the 
manufacturing  world.  He  descends  from  ancient  family,  tracing  to  the 
early  Dutch  settlement  of  the  valley  of  the  Hudson,  and  to  Revolutionary 
ancestors. 

James  Valentine  was  born  in  New  York  City,  January  31,  1808,  and  in 
Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  died  August  4,  1891.  For  many  years  he  was 
engaged  in  business  in  Washington  market,  New  York,  a  butcher.  A 
considerable  part  of  his  life  was  spent  in  New  York,  but  in  1843  he  closed 
his  interests  and  moved  to  Woodbridge,  Middlesex  county,  New  Jersey, 
where  he  died  at  the  age  of  eighty-two.  In  Woodbridge  he  was  a  partner

His  chief  business  in  Woodbridge,  however,  outside  of  his  clay  interest, 
was  caring  for  his  own  investments  in  real  estate,  for  he  prospered  both 
in  New  York  and  in  Woodbridge,  his  clay  interests  developing  until  the 
firm  of  William  H.  Berry  &amp;  Company  became  the  leading  company  in 
the  business,  a  position  they  long  maintained.

Jersey,  and  the  daughter  married  there.  In  this  review  the  career  of  the 
fifth  son,  James  R.,  is  traced,  Mulford  D.,  the  fourth  son,  being  also  of 
extended  mention  in  this  work. 

James  R.  Valentine,  better  known  as  Ross  Valentine,  was  born  in 
New  York  City,  October  11,  1845,  and  died  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey, 
June  24,  1919.  He  was  but  a  child  when  his  parents  moved  to  Wood- 
bridge,  New  Jersey,  the  family  home  at  the  corner  of  Perth  Amboy  ave- 
nue and  Main  street  still  standing.  He  was  educated  in  the  public  schools 
and  Elm  Tree  Institute,  and  after  school  days  were  over  he  became  asso- 
ciated with  his  brother,  Mulford  D.  Valentine,  they  forming  the  firm, 
M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother.  In  1865  they  began  the  manufacture  of  bath 
brick,  in  1867  they  added  drain  pipe,  and  in  1868  fire  brick  were  first  made 
by  them.  That  business  they  developed  to  a  high  degree,  the  company 
owning  their  own  clay  fields,  and  operating  two  plants,  one  at  Valentine 
Station  and  one  at  Woodbridge.  Fire  brick  became  the  company's  chief 
product  and  that  product  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother  shipped  to  all  parts 
of  the  United  States.  Year  by  year  the  business  increased,  the  firm 
attaining  leading  rank  among  the  fire  brick  manufacturers  of  the  coun- 
try.   The  firm  established  an  unassailable  reputation  for  business  integ-

rity  and  reliability,  and  the  partnership  between  the  brothers  begun  in 
1865  continued  until  191 1,  when  it  was  dissolved  by  the  death  of  Mulford 
D.  Valentine. 

The  business  was  incorporated  as  The  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother 
Company,  and  at  the  time  of  his  death,  in  1919,  James  R.  Valentine  was 
its  honored  president.  He  was  a  man  of  public  spirit,  a  friend  of  every 
forward  movement  and  a  good  citizen,  but  averse  to  holding  public  office. 
He  was  a  member  of  the  Masonic  order,  the  Benevolent  and  Protective 
Order  of  Elks,  the  Royal  Arcanum,  and  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church. 
He  married  Sarah  A.  Anness,  who  is  also  deceased,  and  they  were  the 
parents  of  two  children;  Frank  R.,  of  further  mention;  and  Mary  A., 
wife  of  C.  R.  Brown,  of  Woodbridge ;  they  have  three  children :  Victoria 
A.  Brown,  J.  R.  Valentine  Brown,  and  Florence  May  Brown. 

Frank  R.  Valentine,  only  son  of  James  R.  and  Sarah  A.  (Anness) 
Valentine,  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  June  8,  1872.  He  was 
educated  in  private  and  public  schools.  Military  Academy  and  the  Pingry 
School  of  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey.  In  September,  1891,  he  entered  the 
office  employ  of  the  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp;  Brother  Company,  and  later  be- 
came secretary,  and  still  later  treasurer.  Upon  the  death  of  James  R. 
Valentine,  in  1919,  he  was  succeeded  by  Frank  R.  Valentine  as  president 
and  general  manager.  The  business  has  kept  steadily  on  the  increase, 
the  company  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  business  and  one  of  the  most  impor- 
tant. The  company  gave  employment  to  three  hundred  men  at  their 
Woodbridge  and  Valentine  Station  plants,  but  the  recent  sale  of  the  last 
named  plant  reduces  the  number  somewhat. 

In  addition  to  the  executive  management  of  the  M.  D.  Valentine  &amp; 
Brother  Company,  Frank  R.  Valentine  is  a  director  of  the  Perth  Amboy 
Trust  Company,  Middlesex  Title  Guarantee  and  Trust  Company,  Perth 
Amboy  &amp;  Woodbridge  Railroad  Company,  the  Seaboard  Refractory,

deeply  interested  in  all  that  concerns  the  welfare  of  his  town  and  highly 
esteemed.  Genial,  courteous,  friendly  and  considerate,  he  has  a  host  of 
friends,  and  most  worthily  bears  a  name  that  has  long  been  an  honored 
one  in  Woodbridge  and  in  the  business  world. 

Mr.  Valentine  married,  November  19,  1901,  Grace  E.  Ellis,  daughter

JOHN  AUGUSTINE  COAN,  a  native  son,  has  given  to  South  Amboy 
the  strength  of  manhood,  and  in  her  avenues  of  professional  and  business 
opportunity,  he  has  sought  and  found  success.  From  the  date  of  his 
admission  to  the  Middlesex  county  bar,  he  has  practiced  law  within  her 
borders,  and  with  her  business  institutions  he  is  intimately  connected 
both  professionally  and  officially.  He  is  a  son  of  Patrick  Joseph  Coan, 
born  in  County  Roscommon,  Ireland,  in  October,  1839,  and  some  years 
after  his  marriage  came  to  the  United  States  with  his  wife  and  two  chil- 
dren. That  was  in  1870,  and  in  Bordentown,  New  Jersey,  on  the  banks 
of  the  Delaware  he  found  a  home.  Soon  afterward,  however,  he  located 
in  South  Amboy,  where,  until  his  death,  April  22,  191 5,  he  was  in  the  em- 
ploy of  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad.  He  married  Mary  Shanagher,  born  in 
County  Roscommon,  in  November,  1839,  who  still  survives  him  in  her 
eighty-second  year.  They  were  the  parents  of  six  children :  Monsignor 
James  J.  Coan,  rector  of  Queen  of  All  Saints  Roman  Catholic  Church, 
Brooklyn,  New  York ;  Mary  C,  widow  of  William  Birmingham,  of  South 
Amboy ;  Elizabeth  A.,  wife  of  James  F.  McGuire,  of  Perth  Amboy ;  Pat- 
rick J.,  of  South  Amboy ;  John  A.,  of  further  mention ;  Francis  P.,  a  law- 
yer, now  city  attorney  for  the  city  of  South  Amboy. 

John  Augustine  Coan  was  born  in  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  Novem- 
ber 29,  1877.  He  attended  the  public  and  parochial  schools,  finishing 
with  graduation  from  St.  Mary's  Parochial  School  in  1894,  then  passed 
to  Seton  Hall,  South  Orange,  New  Jersey,  whence  he  was  graduated  A. 
B.,  class  of  1898,  A.  M.,  1900.  During  the  years  1898-1900,  he  was  also 
a  student  at  the  New  York  Law  School,  and  in  1900  he  received  his  LL. 
B.  from  that  institution,  that  degree  and  his  A.  M.  from  Seton  Hall  being 
conferred  at  about  the  same  time.  He  was  admitted  to  the  New  Jersey 
bar  in  June,  1900,  and  at  once  began  practice  in  South  Amboy.  The  two 
decades  which  have  since  elapsed  have  brought  him  the  honors  and 
emoluments  with  which  his  profession  rewards  her  capable  sons,  and  he 
also  has  the  confidence  and  respect  of  his  fellowmen,  who  have  watched 
his  career  since  boyhood.  In  addition  to  his  private  practice,  he  was 
assistant  prosecutor  of  the  pleas  and  is  now  solicitor  for  the  Star  Build- 
ing and  Loan  Association  of  South  Amboy,  one  of  the  largest  and  most 
prosperous  associations  of  its  class  in  the  State. 

A  Democrat  in  politics,  Mr.  Coan  served  his  city  on  the  Board  of  Edu- 
cation in  1910-1911,  and  from  1910  to  1914,  was  also  county  solicitor  of 
Middlesex  county.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Knights  of  Columbus;  the 
Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks;  and  a  trustee  of  St.  Mary's 
Roman  Catholic  Church.  He  has  confined  himself  closely  to  professional 
duty,  but  upon  the  organization  of  the  South  Amboy  Trust  Company,  in 
1919,  he  became  a  member  of  the  board  of  directors  and  first  vice-presi- 
dent. During  the  World  War  period,  1917-1918,  he  was  very  active  and 
helpful,  serving  as  local  chairman  of  the  Liberty  Loan  Committee  from 
the  first  to  the  final  Victory  Loan. 

Mr.  Coan  married,  in  South  Amboy,  June  27,  1906,  Nellie  A.  Sullivan, 
born  there,  August  24,  1878,  daughter  of  Daniel  and  Catherine  (Nagle) 
Sullivan,  her  father  deceased,  dying  at  the  age  of  eighty-five,  her  mother

yet  living,  aged  eighty.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Coan  are  the  parents  of  five  chil- 
dren :  Mary  Cecilia,  born  April  9,  1907 ;  Catherine  Marita,  born  April 
14,  1909;  Helen  Agnes,  born  March  10,  1911 ;  John,  born  May  27,  1912; 
James,  born  July  16.  1914.  Every  man  has  a  hobby,  but  Mr.  Coan  has 
two,  baseball  and  automobiling. 

HON.  JOHN  FEE.— There  is  now  and  then  a  man  who  after  he  has 
passed  away  lives  in  the  minds  of  many,  not  only  by  reason  of  results 
accomplished,  but  also  in  consequence  of  a  singularly  forceful  person- 
ality. So  survives  the  memory  of  the  late  Hon.  John  Fee,  who  at  the 
time  of  his  death  was  mayor  of  South  River,  New  Jersey. 

John  Fee  was  born  in  Sayreville,  New  Jersey,  March  27,  1861,  the  son 
of  John  and  Alice  (Ranahan)  Fee.  His  education  was  obtained  in  the 
schools  of  his  native  place.  For  many  years  previous  to  his  death  he  was 
engaged  in  the  wholesale  liquor  business,  which  enterprise  brought  him 
substantial  profit.  He  ever  manifested  that  lively  interest  in  everything 
relating  to  the  public  welfare,  which  was  his  dominant  characteristic,  and 
a  capacity  for  friendship  was  a  gift  which  he  possessed  in  combination 
with  fine  business  abilities.  A  Democrat  in  politics,  he  was  always  active 
in  local  public  affairs  and  served  his  home  town  in  many  capacities.  He 
was  councilman  a  number  of  terms,  and  mayor  for  six  terms,  holding  this 
office  at  the  time  of  his  death,  October  24,  1917.  Mr.  Fee  was  also  a 
member  of  the  Board  of  Freeholders  for  many  years.  In  religion  he  was 
a  Roman  Catholic,  and  his  fraternal  affiliation  was  with  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks. 

On  October  3,  1892,  the  Hon.  John  Fee  was  united  in  marriage  with 
Cora  F.  Mackey,  daughter  of  Lewis  and  Mary  E.  (Dyckman)  Mackey, 
and  they  had  issue :  Cora  Alice,  born  June  23,  1893  &gt;  Florence  Elizabeth, 
born  February  3,  1895;  Augusta  Catherine,  born  May  5,  1897;  John 
Mackey,  born  December  11,  1899;  Helen  Mary,  born  November  13,  1901 ; 
Matthew  James,  born  April  28,  1905. 

From  the  foregoing  outline,  brief  and  imperfect  as  it  necessarily  is,  it 
is  easily  understood  that  John  Fee  was  a  man  of  no  ordinary  ability  as 
an  executant,  and  also  that  he  was  endowed  with  breadth  of  view  and 
liberality  of  sentiment.  He  had  a  rare  capacity  for  friendship,  and  upon 
his  death  was  mourned  by  men  of  every  class  in  the  community  and  fol- 
lowed by  the  blessings  of  many  to  whom  he  had  been  a  friend  in  time  of 
need.  The  crowning  blessing  of  his  years  was  his  union  with  a  woman 
who  was  his  inspirer  and  helper  and  the  presiding  genius  of  his  fireside. 


FRANZ  ROESSLER,  a  prominent  figure  among  the  successful  citi- 
zens of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  he  has  been  engaged  in  busi- 
ness as  a  manufacturing  chemist  for  many  years,  as  head  of  the  great 
Roessler  and  Hasslacher  Chemical  Company,  is  a  native  of  Frankfort- 
on-Mam,  Germany,  born  December  6,  1856,  a  son  of  Fritz  and  Maria 
(Andreae)  Roessler.  His  parents  were  well  known  in  the  city  of  Frank- 
fort, his  father  holding  the  responsible  post  of  director  of  the  mint  for  a 
number  of  years.

Franz  Roessler  was  the  recipient  of  an  unusually  fine  education  dur- 
ing his  childhood  and  youth.    He  attended  as  a  boy  the  volke-schule  or 
public  schools  of  his  native  city,  where  he  was  well  grounded  in  general 
education,  and  upon  graduation  from  these  institutions  entered  the  Uni- 
versity of  Zurich,  Switzerland.     Still  later  he  became  a  student  at  the 
School  of  Mines  at  Freiberg,  Saxony,  where  he  specialized  in  courses 
bearing  upon  chemistry  and  its  application  to  the  arts  and  industry.    In 
the  year  1882  he  came  to  the  United  States  and  engaged  in  business  as  a 
manufacturing  chemist  at  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.    The  Roessler  &amp; 
Hasslacher  Chemical  Company  of  that  city  is  in  a  large  measure  his 
work,  and  its  great  and  rapid  development  which  makes  it  to-day  the 
largest  concern  of  its  kind  not  only  in  the  State  but  probably  also  in  the 
country,  bears  testimony  to  his  great  skill  as  a  chemist  and  not  less  so 
his  remarkable  organizing  and  executive  ability  in  the  business  world. 
Mr.  Roessler  has  always  taken  a  keen  interest  and  an  active  part  in  the 
material  growth  of  the  city  of  his  adoption,  and  is  to-day  associated  with 
a  number  of  its  most  important  financial  institutions,  among  which 
should  be  mentioned  the  First  National  Bank  of  Perth  Amboy  and  the 
Perth  Amboy  Trust  Company.    He  is  also  conspicuous  in  the  social  cir- 
cles and  club  life  of  New  Jersey  and  New  York,  and  is  a  member  of  the 
East  Jersey  Club,  the  New  York  Athletic  Club,  the  Chemists'  Club,  and 
the  Drug  and  Chemical  Club,  all  of  New  York  City.    Mr.  Roessler  is 
to-day  in  the  prime  of  his  mental  and  physical  powers,  and  as  the  active 
head  of  the  great  concern  which  he  has  built  up  plays  an  important  part 
in  the  affairs  of  the  community.    His  unusual  abilities  make  him  a  leader 
among  his  associates,  and  he  may  claim  to  his  credit  the  establishment 
of  a  concern  founded  upon  so  broad  and  firm  a  basis  that  it  not  only  to- 
day dominates  the  chemical  industry  in  this  part  of  the  world,  but  seems 
assured  of  a  similarly  important  place  in  the  future,  guided,  as  it  is  surely 
safe  to  predict,  for  many  years  to  come  by  his  resourceful  and  conserva- 
tive intellect.     A   great  past  and  a   great  present  has   already   been 
achieved  by  him  for  the  Roessler  &amp;  Hasslacher  Chemical  Company,  and 
an  even  greater  future  seems  not  less  certain. 

Franz  Roessler  was  united  in  marriage.  May  11,  1890,  with  Elizabeth 
Kuchler,  a  daughter  of  George  and  Betty  (Stein)  Kuchler,  old  and  highly 
respected  residents  of  that  place.  Six  children  have  been  born  to  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Roessler,  as  follows :  Maria,  born  1892 ;  Hans,  born  1894 ;  Fritz, 
born  1896;  Anna,  born  1898;  Lillie,  born  1900;  and  a  child,  born  1902. 


JOHN  LAZIER  MacDOWALL,  M.  D.,  a  specialist  in  diseases  of  the

profession  in  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  with  offices  at  the  corner 
of  Market  and  State  streets,  Perth  Amboy,  is  a  member  of  one  of  the 
oldest  American  families,  an  ancestor  of  his  being  Mary  Chilton,  who 
came  to  the  New  World  on  the  "Mayflower"  to  seek  religious  liberty,  and 
the  first  woman  to  step  from  the  vessel  onto  the  seemingly  inhospitable 
shore.  The  MacDowalls  later  removed  to  Canada  and  became  prominent 
in  the  life  of  that  country,  a  great-grandfather  of  Dr.  MacDowall  having

been  a  united  Empire  loyalist  and  one  of  the  founders  of  Queen's  Uni- 
versity at  Kingston,  Ontario.  This  Robert  James  MacDowall  was  a  man 
of  strong  religious  convictions  and  played  a  considerable  part  in  the 
affairs  of  Upper  Canada,  where  he  founded  the  Presbyterian  church. 

Dr.  MacDowall's  father,  another  Robert  James  MacDowall,  was  a 
lifelong  resident  of  Kingston,  Ontario,  and  was  there  engaged  in  busi- 
ness as  an  importer  of  musical  instruments.  He  married  Elda  Lucinda 
Lazier,  a  descendant  of  Jacobus  Lazier,  a  French  Huguenot,  who  escaped 
from  France  during  the  Huguenot  massacres,  and  they  were  the  parents 
of  five  children,  as  follows :  Ethel,  who  became  the  wife  of  W.  L.  Mc- 
Farland ;  Etta,  who  became  the  wife  of  Dr.  J.  J.  Robertson ;  John  Lazier, 
with  whom  we  are  here  concerned ;  Robert ;  and  Elda. 

Dr.  John  L.  MacDowall  was  born  August  29,  1878,  in  Kingston,  On- 
tario, Canada,  and  as  a  lad  attended  the  public  schools  of  that  city.  After 
completing  his  studies  at  these  institutions,  he  became  a  student  in  the 
Kingston  Collegiate  Institute  and  graduated  from  there  in  1896  after 
completing  his  preparation  for  a  college  course.  He  then  matriculated 
in  Queen's  University,  Kingston,  of  which  his  great-grandfather  had 
been  one  of  the  founders,  and  there  took  the  classical  course,  graduating 
with  the  degree  of  A.  B.  in  1900.  He  had  determined  to  follow  medicine 
as  a  profession  in  the  meantime,  and  at  once  entered  the  Medical  School 
of  the  same  university  and  received  his  medical  degree  in  1903.  He  then 
came  to  New  York  City  and  took  a  post-graduate  course  in  the  Man- 
hattan Eye  and  Ear  Hospital  in  1904  and  1905.  After  his  graduation 
from  the  last  named  institution.  Dr.  MacDowall  came  directly  to  Perth 
Amboy,  where  he  has  since  practiced.  He  has  been  attended  with  a  high 
degree  of  success  from  the  outset  and  is  now  recognized  as  an  authority 
in  his  chosen  branch  of  medicine.  Besides  his  private  practice  he  holds

SCHUYLER  C.  VAN  CLEEF.— Following  in  the  footsteps  of  his 
father,  James  H.  Van  Cleef,  lawyer,  Assemblyman  and  State  Senator, 
Schuyler  C.  Van  Cleef  prepared  for  the  profession  of  law,  and  since  1898 
has  practiced  at  the  Middlesex  county  bar,  as  did  his  father.  He  has

Jersey,  July  12,  1841.  He  was  an  attorney  and  counsellor-at-law,  prac- 
ticing in  Ntew  Brunswick.  He  was  prominent  in  public  life,  serving  his 
county  and  State  as  both  Assemblyman  and  State  Senator.  He  mar- 
ried Ellis  S.  Clark,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  Schuyler  C.  V&amp;n  Cleef, 
of  whom  further. 

Schuyler  C.  Van  Cleef  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  No- 
vember 13,  1878.  He  was  educated  in  the  public  schools,  Rutgers  Pre- 
paratory School,  and  Brooklyn  Polytechnic  Institute.  He  studied  law 
under  his  eminent  father,  and  on  February  21,  1898,  was  admitted  to  the 
New  Jersey  bar  as  an  attorney,  and  on  February  21,  1907,  as  a  coun- 
sellor. He  has  practiced  law  in  New  Brunswick  very  successfully  during 
the  years  which  have  since  intervened,  and  ranks  high  at  the  Middlesex 
bar.    In  1908  he  was  elected  a  member  of  the  New  Jersey  Legislature.

FORREST  LEIGH  SMITH,  B.  S.,  C.  E.— A  peculiar  interest  at- 
taches to  the  men  behind  any  achievement.  The  workmen  are  in  evi- 
dence during  the  constructive  period,  and  the  completed  work  adds  to  the 
convenience  or  safety  of  the  public,  but  who,  looking  beyond  the  obvious, 
would  not  delight  in  .touching  hands  with  the  man  in  whose  brain  the 
achievement  first  had  birth,  and  who  planned  to  the  smallest  detail  the 
successive  steps  by  which  the  work  was  accomplished?  Forrest  Leigh 
Smith,  of  Mason  &amp;  Smith,  civil  engineers,  is  a  man  whose  career  is  being 
watched  with  the  keenest  interest  by  his  .friends,  because  he  is  the  man 
behind  much  of  the  important  construction  work  in  this  section. 

Mr.  Smith's  father,  James  Augustus  Smith,  was  bom  in  Flemington, 
New  Jersey,  and  has  been  a  resident  of  Perth  Amboy  since  1874.  He  is  a 
prominent  merchant  in  that  city.  He  married  Elizabeth  Noe,  who  was 
born  in  Perth  Amboy,  and  still  lives  there,  at  the  age  of  sixty-six.  They 
were  the  parents  of  six  children :  Marion,  who  died  in  infancy ;  Forrest 
Leigh,  of  this  review;  Mabel  Noe,  the  wife  of  William  Gicking,  of 
Hazleton,  Pennsylvania;  Ethel,  who  lives  at  home;  James  Earl,  who 
also  lives  at  home ;  and  Pearl,  twin  of  the  last  named,  who  died  at  birth. 

Forrest  Leigh  Smith  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  January  20,  1880. 
He  attended  the  schools  of  that  city,  and  was  graduated  from  the  Perth 
Amboy  High  School  in  1897.  He  then  took  a  course  at  Wood's  Business 
College,  then  a  year  at  Rutgers  College,  1898-1899,  being  made  an  asso- 
ciate member  in  1907,  and  from  191 1  to  1915  took  a  course  at  Cooper 
Union,  New  York,  attending  night  classes  and  graduating  with  degrees 
of  B.  S.  and  C.  E.,  receiving  the  former  in  191 1  and  the  latter  in  19 15. 
All  this  time  he  was  carrying  on  his  business  in  Perth  Amboy,  having  in 
1904  formed  a  partnership  with  S.  J.  Mason,  of  Perth  Amboy,  under  the 
name  of  Mason  &amp;  Smith,  civil  engineers.    For  the  past  seventeen  years 


144  MIDDLESEX 

they  have  continued  this  association  of  interests,  and  have  handled  some 
of  the  most  interesting  work  in  this  region. 

Mr.  Smith  was  city  engineer  in  1905,  1906  and  1907;  and  township 
engineer  for  Woodbridge  township  for  eight  years.  He  is  an  associate 
member  of  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers,  and  is  a  member  of 
the  alumni  societies  of  Rutgers  and  Cooper  Union,  and  was  at  one  time 
president  of  the  Perth  Amboy  High  School  Alumni  Association.  His 
favorite  relaxation  is  in  outdoor  sports;  he  ran  on  the  'Varsity  team  at 
Rutgers,  and  has  often  played  on  the  local  football  team.  He  is  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Raritan  Yacht  Club.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  and  was  at  one  time  esteemed  loyal  knight. 

Mr.  Smith  married  Jeannette  Schade,  daughter  of  Nickolas  and  Anna 
(George)  Schade.  Mr.  Schade,  who  is  now  deceased,  was  a  veteran  of 
the  Civil  War,  but  Mrs.  Schade  is  now  living  with  her  daughter.  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Smith  are  the  parents  of  three  children :  Marvin  Schade,  born 
in  1905;  Leonore,  born  in  1907;  and  Arnold,  born  in  1916.  The  family 
are  members  of  the  Presbyterian  church. 


JAMES  LOGAN  CLEVENGER,  numbered  among  the  residents 
of  Perth  Amboy,  is  vice-president  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Evening  News 
Company,  and  editor  of  the  Perth  Amboy  "Evening  News." 

John  Anthony  Clevenger,  father  of  James  Logan  Clevenger,  is  a 
direct  descendant  of  the  family  by  this  name  who  came  over  from 
England  and  were  members  of  the  William  Penn  Colony  in  West  Jer- 
sey. He  was  born  in  Beverly,  New  Jersey,  September  lo,  1841,  and

been  appointed  by  President  Chester  A.  Arthur.  He  married  Julia 
Gaskill,  a  native  of  Mount  Holly,  and  by  this  marriage  became  the  father 
of  two  children:  Mrs.  Grace  C.  Ashton,  of  Hightstown,  New  Jersey; 
James  Logan,  of  further  mention. 

James  Logan  (J.  Logan)  Clevenger,  son  of  John  Anthony  and  Julia 
(Gaskill)  Clevenger,  was  born  on  a  farm  near  Mount  Holly,  Burlington 
county.  New  Jersey,  February  13,  1879.  He  was  brought  by  his  parents 
to  the  town  of  South  Amboy  when  he  was  but  five  years  of  age,  and 
lived  there  for  nine  years  and  there  attended  school.  In  1891  the  family 
moved  to  Hightstown,  where  his  parents  have  ever  since  resided,  and 
here  he  attended  the  Peddie  Institute,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in 
1896,  supplementing  this  with  one  year  at  Drexel  Institute,  Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  the  private  secretarial 
course,  in  1897.  He  then  entered  the  law  office  of  his  uncle,  Joseph  H.

as  a  reporter  on  the  Asbury  Park  "Journal"  for  the  summer  season, 
becoming  a  reporter  on  the  Perth  Amboy  "Chronicle"  in  the  fall  of  1899, 
and  in  1901  with  the  Newark  "Evening  News."  In  1903,  with  two  others, 
he  bought  the  Perth  Amboy  "Republican,"  which  name  was  changed  to

BIOGRAPHICAL  145 

of  the  community  in  which  he  lives  he  has  ever  manifested  a  deep 
interest,  aiding  always  to  the  utmost  of  his  power  any  movement  which 
tends  to  further  public  progress  or  good  government.  He  afifiliates  with 
St.  Peter's  Episcopal  Church  and  is  a  member  of  the  vestry.  His  clubs

JOHN  FRANCIS  WEBER,  M.  D.— Dr.  Weber  was  one  of  the 
patriotic  physicians  of  the  county  who  forsook  a  private  professional 
career  to  serve  his  country  in  her  need,  and  in  camp  and  hospital,  on 
transport  and  battlefield,  risked  contagion  and  death  for  the  sick  and 
dying.  The  story  of  what  the  medical  corps  of  the  American  army  did  at 
home  and  abroad  for  their  own,  their  allies,  and  even  their  enemies, 
may  never  be  told  in  full,  but  should  it  be  told  even  in  part,  it  will  form 
the  brightest  page  in  all  medical  history.  Nor  should  the  non-pro- 
fessional men  of  the  medical  and  hospital  corps,  nor  the  nurses  be  over- 
looked when  self-sacrifice  and  devotion  are  the  themes  under  discussion, 
for  they  worked,  suffered,  and  went  down  into  every  depth  of  human 
woe  that  the  professionals  did.  To  men  like  Dr.  Weber,  America  owes 
a  huge  debt  of  gratitude,  the  only  payment  they  ask  for  their  sacrifice. 

John  Francis  Weber,  son  of  William  A.  and  Emma  H.  Weber,  was 
born  at  Florence,  Burlington  county.  New  Jersey,  January  21,  1889,  his 
father  a  merchant.  He  attended  Florence  public  schools  until  graduated 
from  grammar  school  in  1903,  then  was  a  student  in  Asbury  Park  High 
School  during  the  school  year  1904-05.  He  then  entered  Blight  Prepara- 
tory School,  finishing  with  the  graduating  class  of  1908.  Choosing  the 
profession  of  medicine,  he  entered  the  medical  department  of  the  Univer- 
sity of  Pennsylvania,  whence  he  was  graduated  M.  D.,  class  of  1913.  The 
following  year  was  spent  as  interne  at  Howard  and  Chestnut  Hill  hos- 
pitals, his  private  practice  beginning  at  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  in 
1914,  and  continuing  until  January  31,  1918.  He  then  entered  the 
military  service  of  the  United  States  in  the  medical  corps,  continuing 
until  honorably  discharged  with  the  rank  of  captain,  July  3,  1919.  On 
August  I,  1919,  he  resumed  private  practice  in  South  Amboy  and  there, 
where  so  well  known,  he  is  most  highly  appreciated  both  as  physician  and 
citizen. 

Dr.  Weber's  military  career  began  with  his  enlistment  in  the  medical 
corps  and  his  appointment  to  the  rank  of  first  lieutenant  at  the  Army 
Medical  School  at  Washington,  D.  C,  which  he  attended  from  February 
I  to  March  15,  1918.  From  March  16  to  May  10,  1918,  he  was  on  duty 
at  Field  No.  i,  Aviation  General  Supply  Department,  Garden  City, 
Long  Island,  going  to  Camp  Dix,  New  Jersey,  where  his  service  covered 
the  period  from  May  11  to  May  19,  1918.  He  was  assigned  to  the  311th 
Regiment  of  Infantry,  78th  Division,  and  with  that  organization  sailed 
from  the  Bush  Terminal  in  Brooklyn,  May  19,  1918.    They  landed  in 

Mid-10 


146  MIDDLESEX 

Liverpool,  England,  May  31st,  following,  and  on  June  ist  sailed  for 
Folkstone,  England,  landing  in  Calais,  France,  the  same  day.  He  served 
with  the  American  Expeditionary  Force  in  France  until  May  10,  1919, 
when  he  sailed  from  Bordeaux,  France,  arriving  in  Hoboken,  New  Jersey, 
May  26,  1919.  The  command  was  taken  at  once  to  Camp  Merritt,  leaving 
there  June  3rd  for  Camp  DLx,  where  Dr.  Weber  received  honorable 
discharge,  July  3,  1919,  having  left  that  camp  just  one  year,  one  month 
and  fourteen  days  earlier. 

The  nature  and  value  of  the  service  Dr.  Weber  rendered  may  be 
surmised  from  the  military  records.  He  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of 
captain,  February  14,  1919,  and  received  from  his  own  country  the  Dis- 
tinguished Service  Cross,  and  from  France  the  Croix  de  Guerre. 

Dr.  Weber  is  a  member  of  the  Protestant  Episcopal  church,  the 
Masonic  order,  and  Phi  Alpha  Sigma,  the  latter  a  medical  fraternity. 

Dr.  Weber  married,  October  21,  1916,  at  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, 
Rebecca  Duval,  daughter  of  George  and  Madeline  S.  Duval.  Dr.  and 
Mrs.  Weber  are  the  parents  of  two  children :  William  Duval,  born  August 
29,  1917 ;  and  Dorothy  Louise,  born  December  5,  1918.

his  way  toward  success.  He  is  a  son  of  John  Seaman,  born  in  Austria- 
Hungary,  as  it  once  existed,  and  at  about  seventeen  years  of  age  came

ABEL  F.  RANDOLPH.— Members  of  the  Randolph  family  have 
long  been  located  in  New  Jersey,  and  in  both  Union  and  Middlesex  coun- 
ties have  been  prominent  in  business,  in  agriculture  and  in  the  profes- 
sions. During  the  last  twenty  years  of  his  useful  life,  Abel  F.  Randolph 
was  a  lumber  dealer  of  Metuchen,  there  conducting  a  prosperous  business 
and  acquiring  a  competence.  In  1880  he  built  a  handsome  residence  in 
Metuchen,  and  there  his  widow,  Mrs.  Margaret  E.  Randolph,  yet  resides. 
He  was  a  son  of  Samuel  and  Mary  (Boyce)  Randolph,  his  father  a 
farmer,  and  at  the  time  of  the  birth  of  his  son,  Abel  F.,  resided  at  Plain-

Abel  F.  Randolph  was  born  at  Plainfield,  New  Jersey,  February  24, 
1834,  and  died  in  Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  in  July,  1912.  He  was  edu- 
cated in  the  public  schools,  and  although  the  son  of  a  farmer,  he  did 
not  take  kindly  to  farm  life  and  when  free  to  make  his  own  choice  of 
an  occupation  he  chose  a  mercantile  life.  He  was  variously  engaged  with 
different  firms,  finally  becoming  so  well  qualified  that  he  established  in 
the  lumber  business  with  Manning  Freeman.  He  remained  in  the  lumber 
business  until  his  death,  which,  as  before  stated,  covered  a  period  of 
twenty  years.  He  was  an  able  business  man,  a  good  manager,  and  one 
whom  all  respected  for  his  upright  life  and  sterling  character.  In  politics 
he  was  an  Independent;  and  he  attended  services  at  the  Methodist 
Episcopal  church. 

Mr.  Randolph  married,  in  Metuchen,  December  20,  1856,  Margaret 
E.  Guernsey,  born  July  25,  1836,  in  Connecticut,  daughter  of  Asa  B. 
and  Sarah  A.  (Canfield)  Guernsey.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Randolph  were  the 
parents  of  twelve  children :  Juliett,  Joseph,  Charles,  George  John, 
Nathan,  Edwin,  Harry,  Jane,  Jeannette,  Ella,  Nellie,  and  William.  Mrs. 
Randolph  attends  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church,  as  did  her  husband. 


GEORGE  JULIUS  MILLER,  numbered  among  the  young  profes- 
sional men  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  gives  promise  of  a  brilliant 
future.  Persuasive  as  an  advocate,  clear  and  forceful  in  argument,  and 
an  all-round,  whole-hearted  American,  his  friends  are  watching  his  rise 
in  his  profession  with  the  greatest  interest. 

He  is  a  son  of  Julius  and  Lena  Miller,  his  father  being  a  prominent 
merchant  in  Perth  Amboy,  where  he,  has  conducted  a  furniture  business 
for  the  past  twenty  years. 

George  J.  Miller  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  on  January  15,  1895. 
When  five  years  of  age  he  entered  the  public  schools  of  the  city,  and 
was  ready  for  high  school  at  the  age  of  thirteen.  Entering  high  school- 
in  1908,  he  was  graduated  in  1912  (a  class  from  which  seven  graduates 
have  entered  the  legal  profession),  and  that  fall  began  a  course  at  the 
New  Jersey  Law  School;  which  ended  with  his  graduation  in  191 5.  He 
was  a  facile  student,  and  possessed  a  retentive  mind.  During  all  his 
high  school  and  law  studies  he  assisted  his  father  in  the  store  many 
hours  while  out  of  school.  He  entered  upon  the  practice  of  law  in 
1916,  only  to  awaken,  in  July  of  the  following  year,  to  the  great  need 
of  his  country  for  men  to  do  war  service.    He  enlisted  as  a  private,  on 


148  MIDDLESEX 

July  15,  191 7,  was  promoted  to  sergeant-major,  Coast  Artillery  Corps, 
on  December  16,  1917,  and  on  March  20,  1918,  he  was  made  army  field 
clerk  at  the  general  headquarters  of  the  American  Expeditionary  Forces, 
with  the  Chief  of  Artillery,  where  he  was  serving  at  the  time.  He 
reentered  the  practice  of  law  upon  his  discharge  from  the  army  on  June 
16,  1919.  He  became  a  counsellor  at  law  and  master  in  chancery  in 
December,  1919,  passing  both  examinations  the  first  time  he  took  them. 
This  is  a  record  in  which  the  young  attorney's  townspeople  take  a  very 
natural  pride.  He  married  Bertha  Francis  Sarokin  on  January  15,  1921. 
Mr.  Miller  acknowledges  two  hobbies — public  speaking,  and,  in  close 
alliance,  books.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Young  Men's  Hebrew  Associa- 
tion, and  of  the  Zionists.  His  religious  convictions  are  those  of  the 
Jewish  Orthodox.    In  political  affiliation  he  is  a  Republican. 


FRITZ  WILLIAM  HOYLER,  works  manager  of  Plant  No.  i,  of 
the  Roessler  &amp;  Hasslacher  Chemical  Company  of  Perth  Amboy,  New 
Jersey,  has  been  well  known  in  business  and  industrial  circles  of  the  city 
for  above  two  decades,  and  has  always  been  regarded  by  his  fellow- 
townsmen  as  an  enlightened  and  public-spirited  citizen.  He  is  a  native 
of  France,  born  in  the  city  of  Paris,  May  3,  1869,  a  son  of  John  Martin 
and  Sophie  (Jocher)  Hoyler,  who  were  then  residing  in  that  city.  The 
elder  Mr.  Hoyler  was  born  in  Stuttgart,  Germany,  and  his  wife  in  the 
same  place.  They  were  the  parents  of  ten  children,  of  whom  only  one 
is  now  living,  Fritz  William. 

When  their  son,  Fritz  William  Hoyler,  was  yet  a  small  child  the 
elder  Mr.  Hoyler  returned  to  Germany  and  settled  in  the  city  of  Frank- 
fort, and  it  was  there  that  the  lad  was  reared  to  manhood  and  received 
his  education.  He  attended  first  the  local  volkschule  or  public  school, 
and  upon  completing  his  studies  at  this  institution  entered  a  private 
chemical  laboratory  and  took  up  the  study  of  chemistry.  He  eventually 
engaged  in  the  assaying  business  in  Frankfort  and  continued  thus  occu- 
pied until  November  15,  1889,  o"  which  date  he  sailed  for  the  United 
States.  Upon  reaching  this  country,  he  at  once  entered  the  employ 
of  the  Roessler  &amp;  Hasslacher  Chemical  Company,  of  Perth  Amboy,  as 
an  analytical  chemist  and  thus  established  an  association  that  has  ever 
since  continued.  In  1910  he  was  appointed  works  manager,  the  office 
that  he  holds  at  the  present  time,  discharging  the  responsible  duties 
of  that  post  with  the  highest  degree  of  efficiency  and  making  himself 
one  of  the  most  valued  members  of  the  company's  organization.  Mr. 
Hoyler  is  also  interested  in  the  general  afifairs  of  the  community  in 
which  he  has  elected  to  reside  and  has  taken  a  conspicuous  part  in  them. 
From  1909  to  1914  he  held  the  office  of  commissioner  of  the  Perth 
Amboy  Library,  and  has  done  much  to  develop  that  institution  and 
-increase  its  value  to  the  city  and  extend  the  scope  of  its  work.  Mr.  Hoy- 
ler is  an  Independent  in  politics,  and  in  this  displays  his  characteristic 
independence  of  mind,  preferring  to  exercise  his  own  best  judgment  on 
all  matters  of  public  interest  with  freedom  rather  than  be  in  any  degree 
bound  by  partisan  considerations.    He  is  a  well  known  figure  in  social 


BIOGRAPHICAL  149 

and  fraternal  circles  in  the  city,  and  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent 
and  Protective  Order  of  Elks  and  a  trustee  of  that  order.  From  early- 
youth  Mr.  Hoyler  has  taken  great  pleasure  in  athletics  of  all  kinds, 
especially  such  sports  and  pastimes  as  are  carried  on  out-of-doors.  As 
a  young  man  he  played  football  a  great  deal,  but  more  recently  has 
sought  his  recreation  in  automobiling,  of  which  he  is  very  fond  and 
does  considerable  motoring  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  He  also 
takes  plenty  of  exercise  in  bowling. 

Fritz  William  Hoyler  was  united  in  marriage,  March  21,  1900,  with 
Lena  F.  Schopper,  a  native  of  New  York  City,  a  daughter  of  Theodore 
and  Antoinette  (Most)  Schopper,  of  that  place,  where  the  former  is  a 
retired  business  man  of  prominence.  One  child  has  been  born  to  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Hoyler,  Helen  Louise,  born  January  26,  1901,  who  resides 
in  Perth  Amboy  with  her  parents. 


ELMER  HAROLD  EULNER,  M.  D.— Dr.  Eulner  began  his  career 
as  a  private  practitioner  of  medicine  in  South  Amboy,  in  September, 
1908,  and  has  steadily  grown  in  public  estimation  as  a  skilled  and  hon- 
orable physician.  He  has  also  taken  an  active  part  in  South  Amboy's 
business  development  and  in  her  civic  affairs,  particularly  so  in  the 
health  department,  for  he  preaches  prevention  of  disease  and  puts  the

REV.  ARTHUR  LOUIS  KREYLING.— Although  he  is  a  com- 
paratively recent  comer  to  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  the  Rev.  Arthur 
Louis  Kreyling  has  already  made  an  important  place  for  himself  in  the 
religious  life  of  the  community  and  gained  the  esteem  and  affection  of 
his  congregation  as  pastor  of  the  Lutheran  Church  of  Our  Saviour  in 
that  city.  Mr.  Kreyling  is  a  native  of  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  where  his 
birth  occurred,  July  18,  1889,  and  a  son  of  Christian  and  Bertha  (Bentel) 
Kreyling,  old  and  highly  respected  residents  of  that  place,  the  former 
having  been  successfully  engaged  in  business  there  as  a  caterer  for  a 
number  of  years. 

The  childhood  of  Arthur  L.  Kreyling  was  passed  in  the  city  of  his 
birth,  and  he  there  attended  the  parochial  school  of  the  Mount  Calvary 
English  Lutheran  Church  until  his  graduation  in  June,  1902.  He  had 
been  prepared  for  college  at  that  institution,  and  in  September  of  the 
same  year  matriculated  at  St.  John's  College.  There  he  took  the 
classical  course  and  graduated  with  the  degree  of  B.  A.  in  1908.  The 
young  man  had  by  that  time  definitely  determined  upon  entering  the 
ministry  of  the  Lutheran  church,  and  with  this  end  in  view,  matricu- 
lated at  the  Concordia  Lutheran  Theological  Seminary  at  St.  Louis,  in 
September,  1908.  He  pursued  his  studies  in  divinity  at  that  institution 
until  he  was  graduated  therefrom  with  the  class  of  191 1.  He  was 
regularly  ordained  into  the  ministry  July  2,  191 1,  and  was  sent  to  do 
missionary  work  at  Chickasha,  Oklahoma,  remaining  at  that  post  until 
November,  1914.  In  December  of  the  same  year  Mr.  Kreyling  was 
called  to  the  Immanuel  Lutheran  Church  of  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, 
and  remained  in  charge  of  that  church  until  the  entrance  of  the  United 
States  into  the  World  War.  Mr.  Kreyling  was  prompt  to  offer  his 
services  to  the  government,  and  was  shortly  after  appointed  camp  pastor 
for  the  Lutheran  church  at  Camp  Meade  and  for  eight  camps  in  the 
Baltimore  district.  His  war  services  continued  from  December,  1917, 
until  June,  1919,  when  he  received  his  honorable  discharge.    It  was  in 


152  MIDDLESEX 

August,  1919,  that  Mr.  Kreyling  came  to  Perth  Amboy,  whither  he  had 
been  called  to  take  the  pastorate  of  the  Lutheran  Church  of  Our  Saviour, 
a  post  which  he  continues  to  occupy.  In  the  brief  space  of  time  that  he 
has  been  in  charge  of  his  present  church,  Mr.  Kreyling  has  proven 
himself  a  most  active  and  devoted  clergyman  and  has  done  much  to 
organize  the  work  of  the  parish. 

Arthur  Louis  Kreyling  was  united  in  marriage  at  St.  Louis,  Missouri, 
with  Florence  Stephanie  Tacke,  a  daughter  of  Charles  William  and 
Emma  Kathryn  (Schenck)  Tacke  of  that  place.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Kreyling 
are  the  parents  of  three  children,  as  follows :  Dorothy  Lillian,  born  July 
3,  1914;  Arthur  Ralph,  born  January  10,  1916;  and  Ruth  Adele,  born 
November  14,  1917. 


DR.  HARRY  WILLARD  McDONALD,  JR.— As  an  exceptionally 
able  chiropractor.  Dr.  Henry  Willard  McDonald,  Jr.,  has  attained  pres- 
tige in  the  practice  of  his  profession,  his  success  having  come  as  the 
logical  sequence  of  thorough  technical  information,  as  enforced  by 
natural  predilection  and  that  sympathy  and  tact  which  are  the  enviable 
concomitants  of  precedence  in  professional  life. 

Harry  Willard  McDonald,  Sr.,  father  of  Dr.  Harry  W.  McDonald, 
was  born  in  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  the  son  of  Andrew  McDonald,  who 
brought  his  family  to  this  country  when  he  was  a  young  man.  Andrew 
McDonald  took  an  active  part  in  both  the  Mexican  and  Civil  wars.  He 
died  in  Pittsburgh,  at  the  age  of  eighty-six  years.  Harry  Willard 
McDonald,  Sr.,  now  lives  retired  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  where  for 
many  years  he  was  president  of  the  Pittsburgh  Real  Estate  Exchange. 
He  married  Margaret  Thompson,  of  Ballyhaise,  Ireland,  and  they  are 
the  parents  of  one  child,  Harry  Willard,  Jr.,  mentioned  below. 

Harry  Willard  McDonald,  Jr.,  was  born  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, 
October  8,  1886.  His  preliminary  education  was  obtained  in  the  public 
schools  of  his  native  place  and  the  Allegheny  High  School,  graduating 
from  the  latter  in  1904.  He  then  went  to  Fresno,  California,  where  he 
lived  on  a  ranch  for  three  years,  after  which  he  traveled  through  the 
southern  part  of  Mexico  and  then  through  Canada  on  account  of  ill 
health.  In  191 1  he  returned  to  his  native  city,  Pittsburgh,  and  having 
decided  to  become  a  chiropractor,  he  entered  the  Central  College  of 
Chiropractic  at  Pittsburgh,  from  which  institution  he  was  graduated 
in  1914,  later  matriculating  at  the  Palmer  School  at  Davenport,  Iowa. 
Upon  the  conclusion  of  the  period  spent  in  the  Palmer  School,  he  went 
to  New  York  City  and  established  himself  in  active  practice  there,  but 
soon,  thereafter,  opened  an  office  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  con- 
tinuing to  practice  in  New  York  City,  however,  until  1917,  when  he 
discontinued  his  practice  there  and  since  has  devoted  himself  exclusively 
to  his  ever-increasing  clientele  in  this  community,  his  office  at  No.  90 
Monument  Square. 

Dr.  McDonald  is  a  member  of  New  Brunswick  Lodge,  No.  324, 
Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  and  the  Improved  Order  of 
Red  Men.  In  religion  he  is  a  Presbyterian,  being  a  member  of  the 
First  United  Presbyterian  Church  of  Pittsburgh. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  153 

With  a  vigorous  and  luminous  intellect,  Dr.  McDonald  combines 
strength  of  character  and  a  genial  disposition.  This  union  of  traits 
explains  in  a  large  measure  his  success,  and  gives  promise  of  even  more 
signal  achievements  in  the  future.  He  is  a  close  student,  keeping  fully 
abreast  of  modern  thought  in  all  matters  pertaining  to  his  profession, 
and  he  possesses  the  high  esteem  and  implicit  confidence  of  the  general 
public.    Dr.  McDonald  has  never  married. 


AUGUST  C.  STREITWOLF.— This  name  is  not  an  introduction, 
it  is  simply  an  announcement.  To  introduce  Mr.  Streitwolf  to  the 
readers  of  this  work  would  be  wholly  superfluous,  for  his  high  standing 
as  a  representative  citizen  is  common  knowledge  beyond  the  limits  of 
his  home  town,  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey. 

August  C.  Streitwolf  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  May  19,  1879, 
the  son  of  August  and  Elizabeth  (Landmesser)  Streitwolf.  He  obtained 
his  elementary  education  in  the  public  schools  of  his  native  place  and 
then  entered  Peddie  Institute  at  Hightstown,  New  Jersey,  where  he 
remained  for  a  while,  after  which,  having  determined  to  adopt  the  law 
as  a  profession,  he  matriculated  at  the  law  school  of  the  New  York  Uni- 
versity, from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1900  with  the  degree  of  Bach- 
elor of  Laws,  and  was  admitted  to  practice  as  an  attorney  and  counsellor 
in  New  York  State,  May  14,  1901,  as  an  attorney  in  New  Jersey,  June  10, 
1901,  and  as  a  counsellor  in  this  State,  June  29,  1904.  From  1901  until 
1919  he  maintained  an  office  for  general  practice  in  both  New  York  City 
and  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  but  when  elected  to  his  present 
position  as  president  of  the  Middlesex  Title  Guarantee  and  Trust  Com- 
pany at  New  Brunswick,  he  retired  from  active  law  practice  in  New 
York  City,  but  continued  to  maintain  a  nominal  office  at  No.  59  Wall 
street  in  connection  with  his  bank  duties  and  the  general  practice  of 
law  at  New  Brunswick.  Mr.  Streitwolf  is  general  counsel  for  the  New 
Brunswick  Fire  Insurance  Company;  also  counsel  for  various  corpora- 
tions, and  his  favorite  branch  of  legal  practice  is  corporation  law. 

In  politics  Mr.  Streitwolf  is  a  staunch  Democrat,  and  takes  an  ardent 
interest  in  the  aflfairs  of  the  organization.  He  served  in  the  General 
Assembly  of  New  Jersey  in  191 1,  and  again  was  elected  to  serve  the 
following  year.  He  affiliates  with  Union  Lodge,  No.  19,  Free  and 
Accepted  Masons.  A  Baptist  in  religion,  he  has  always  served  the 
Livingston  Avenue  Baptist  Church  well  by  personal  interest,  and  his 
means  are  ever  contributed  to  it. 

On  April  17,  1907,  Mr.  Streitwolf  was  united  in  marriage  with  Edna 
E.  Rose.    They  have  no  issue. 

August  C.  Streitwolf  might  be  called  one  of  the  most  prominent 
business  men  in  New  Brunswick,  for  such  he  is  in  the  highest  sense. 
Executant,  financier,  citizen,  philanthropist — all  these  he  is  to  an  emi- 
nent degree,  but  perhaps  an  attempt  to  describe  him  in  a  single  phrase 
would  be  best  accomplished  by  the  simple  statement  "that  he  is  a  true 
man."

SELDEN  TALCOTT  KINNEY,  M.  D.— When  Dr.  Kinney  came 
to  South  Amboy  in  1913,  he  was  not  without  practical  medical  experi- 
ence, having  been  out  of  college  for  two  years,  during  which  he  served 
as  hospital  interne,  and  was  associated  with  his  father  in  sanitarium 
practice  at  Easton.  He  is  now  well  established  in  practice  in  South 
Amboy,  and  is  highly  regarded  by  the  brethren  of  his  profession. 

Dr.  Kinney  is  of  ancient  Colonial  family,  the  Kinneys  having  come

courses  in  three  hospitals,  including  the  Middletown  State  Hospital  and 
the  Gowanda  Hospital.  He  also  studied  under  his  father,  a  noted

institutions  in  this  city. 

Born  May  17,  1888,  in  New  Brunswick,  the  boyhood  days  of  Charles

ISADORE  SIEGEL,  M.  D.— Although  but  a  few  years  have  elapsed 
since  his  coming  to  Perth  Amboy,  the  name  of  Dr.  Isadore  Siegel  is 
already  familiar  and  most  favorably  so  to  a  majority  of  residents  of  the 
community.  Dr.  Siegel  has  during  these  few  years  thoroughly  identified 
himself  both  as  a  physician  and  a  citizen  with  the  progressive  element 
of  the  city. 

Moses  Siegel,  father  of  Isadore  Siegel,  was  born  in  Russia,  and  for  a 
number  of  years  carried  on  a  successful  grocery  business  there.  In  1908 
he  retired  from  active  business  life  and  came  with  his  wife  and  family 
to  this  country,  settling  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Siegel  are  the  parents  of  six  children :  Sophia,  wife  of  H.  Goldstein,  of 
Perth  Amboy ;  George,  a  constructing  engineer  in  Russia ;  Harry,  a  dry 
goods  merchant  with  a  store  at  No.  444  Amboy  avenue ;  Anna,  wife  of 
N.  GalosofI,  of  Perth  Amboy ;  Isadore,  of  further  mention ;  Constance,  a 
resident  of  Newark,  New  Jersey. 

Isadore  Siegel,  son  of  Moses  and  Rose  Siegel,  was  born  January  5, 
1885,  in  Russia.  After  graduating  from  the  Gymnasium  in  his  native 
city,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  high  school  in  this  country,  he  matricu- 
lated in  Berlin  University,  from  which  he  was  graduated  in  1910  with  the 
degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine.  He  immediately  came  to  this  country  and 
after  serving  his  interneship  of  one  year  in  the  Lying-in  Hospital  in  New 


156  MIDDLESEX 

York  City,  and  passing  his  State  Board  examination,  which  latter  he 
completed  July  5,  191 1,  he  decided  to  establish  himself  in  the  practice  of 
his  profession  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  his  parents  had  made 
their  home  since  coming  to  this  country.  With  an  office  at  No.  121  Mar- 
ket street,  Perth  Amboy,  he  is  acquiring  a  large  and  steadily  growing 
clientele  and  carving  out  for  himself  a  place  in  the  front  rank  of  the  city's 
younger  physicians.  He  is  a  member  of  the  American  Medical  Associa- 
tion and  the  Middlesex  Medical  Society.  Politically,  Dtr.  Siegel  is  an  In- 
dependent, voting  for  the  candidate  he  believes  best  fitted  for  the  office 
sought,  regardless  of  party  label.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Hebrew  Syna- 
gogue, and  also  affiliates  with  the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons. 

Ur.  Siegel  married,  July  28,  1913,  Jeanette  Kramer,  a  daughter  of 
Abraham  Kramer,  a  dry  goods  merchant  at  No.  313  State  street,  Perth 
Amboy.  Dr.  and  Mrs.  Siegel  are  the  parents  of  a  son,  Ralph,  born  May 
2,  1914,  and  a  daughter,  Shirley  Eleanor,  born  April  2,  1920. 

With  a  vigorous  and  luminous  intellect.  Dr.  Siegel  combines  strength 
of  character  and  a  genial  disposition.  This  union  of  traits  explains  in  a 
large  measure  his  success  and  gives  promise  of  even  more  signal  achieve- 
ments in  the  future.  His  hobby  is  music  and  he  is  particularly  fond  of 
the  opera.  He  is  a  close  student,  keeping  fully  abreast  of  modem  thought 
in  all  matters  pertaining  to  his  profession,  and  possesses  the  high  esteem 
and  explicit  confidence  of  the  medical  fraternity  and  the  general  public. 


LEO  J.  COAKLEY. — It  is  a  somewhat  unusual  occurrence  for  four 
generations  of  one  family  to  be  living  in  the  same  city,  yet  such  is  the 
case  with  Leo  J.  Coakley,  he  and  his  little  daughter  constituting  two 
generations,  his  mother  and  her  father  being  the  other  two,  all  residing 
in  South  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 

Born  in  that  city,  December  28,  1890,  Leo  J.  Coakley  is  the  son  of 
John  J.  and  Anna  (Costello)  Coakley.  The  former  is  in  the  grocery 
business,  at  No.  117  Broadway,  South  Amboy,  and  was  at  one  time  a 
member  of  the  Board  of  Education  of  the  city,  also  treasurer  of  the  Star 
Building  and  Loan  Association  there.  His  wife,  Anna  (Costello)  Coak- 
ley, is  the  daughter  of  Walter  Costello,  who  came  to  the  United  States 
many  years  ago  from  Ireland  and  has  lived  in  South  Amboy  for  more 
than  fifty  years.  He  is  now  eighty-four  years  old  (1921).  The  Coakley 
family  also  came  from  Ireland. 

Attending  St.  Mary's  Parochial  School  in  South  Amboy  in  his  boy- 
hood, Leo  J.  Coakley  acquired  his  education  partly  in  that  institution  and 
later  went  to  St.  Peter's  College  at  Jersey  City,  New  Jersey.  After  g^radu- 
ating  from  the  latter,  Mr.  Coakley  took  up  the  study  of  law,  becoming  a 
student  at  the  New  York  Law  School.  He  was  admitted  to  practice  at 
the  New  Jersey  State  bar  in  February,  1914,  and  at  once  opened  an  office 
in  his  home  town,  at  No.  118  North  Broadway. 

In  the  public  affairs  of  the  city  Mr.  Coakley  has  been  particularly 
active,  both  in  civic  matters  and  in  the  field  of  politics,  he  being  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Democratic  party.    In  1916  Mr.  Coakley  was  appointed  secre- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  157 

tary  of  the  Board  of  Health  of  South  Amboy,  his  term  being  one  year. 
From  1917  to  1920  he  was  city  solicitor  of  South  Amboy. 

During  the  World  War  Mr.  Coakley  enlisted  in  the  army  and  was 
assigned  for  duty  at  the  medical  detachment  headquarters,  port  of  em- 
barkation, Newport  News,  Virginia,  remaining  there  until  discharged, 
in  January,  1919.  After  the  troops  were  disbanded  and  the  American 
Legion  was  formed,  Mr.  Coakley  became  a  member  of  it.  He  is  now  past 
vice-commander  of  the  county  association. 

In  addition  to  the  American  Legion,  Mr.  Coakley  is  a  member  of  the 
Knights  of  Columbus,  being  a  past  grand  knight  of  the  order.  He  is 
also  connected  with  the  local  lodge  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective 
Order  of  Elks.  He  is  fond  of  outdoor  sports,  but  his  favorite  pastime  is 
to  witness  a  good  baseball  game. 

At  South  Amboy,  June  5,  1918,  Leo  J.  Coakley  was  married  to  Kath- 
ryn  M.  Lyons,  a  daughter  of  Thomas  and  Catherine  Lyons.  They  have 
one  child,  Eileen  Coakley,  born  December  18,  1919.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Coak- 
ley are  members  of  the  Roman  Catholic  church. 


AUGUST  K.  STAUDT.— Captains  and  leaders  of  industry  in  their 
respective  lines  almost  invariably  are  self-made  men.  Their  lives  blend 
closely  with  romance,  giving  an  inspiring  example  of  just  what  energy, 
perseverance  and  ability  can  accomplish.  Success  becomes  part  of  their 
everyday  activities,  and  each  year  is  like  a  stepping  stone  to  still  greater 
and  more  pronounced  achievements. 

August  K.  Staudt  stands  prominent  among  the  leading  citizens  of 
Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  a  brief  resume  of  his  life  reflects  well- 
earned  rewards  in  his  chosen  field.  Tireless  energy  and  broad  public- 
spirited  benevolence  have  been  the  keynotes  of  his  success,  and  his  nota- 
ble progress  in  local  circles  indicates  still  more  marked  distinction  in  his 
activities  in  the  time  to  come.    His  career  is  an  inspiration. 

Mr.  Staudt  was  born  in  Nuremberg,  Bavaria,  Germany,  on  December 
6,  1869.  He  was  the  second  child  of  Conrad  and  Rosa  Staudt  in  a  family 
of  eight  children,  four  boys  and  four  girls.  Receiving  his  education  in 
Germany,  and  satisfactorily  fulfilling  his  military  duties  in  the  Bavarian 
army,  he  left  his  native  land,  in  1891,  The  five  years  following  were 
spent  in  England,  America  and  France,  and  in  this  time  Mr.  Staudt  per- 
fected his  training  as  a  correspondent  in  foreign  languages. 

Upon  his  return  to  Nuremberg  in  1896,  Mr.  Staudt  became  connected 
with  a  large  local  industry,  and  a  year  later,  in  1897,  married  Katherine 
P.  Vorgang,  of  Brooklyn,  New  York,  whom  he  had  met  on  his  visit  to 
America,  and  who,  in  the  year  noted,  was  visiting  relatives  in  Germany. 
Mr.  Staudt  was  soon  made  superintendent  of  the  Nuremberg  factory,  but 
relinquished  this  position  in  1901  to  take  up  a  residence  with  Mrs.  Staudt 
in  America. 

After  occupying  a  number  of  important  positions  in  banks  and  com- 
mercial houses,  Mr.  Staudt  associated  himself  with  the  Perth  Amboy  Tile 
Works,  and  became  a  resident  of  this  city.  The  plant  at  that  time  was 
practically  unknown  and  quite  insignificant,  while  the  company,  itself. 


iS8  MIDDLESEX 

had  just  been  reorganized.  It  was  not  long  before  unexpected  difficulties 
arose,  and  in  order  to  safeguard  the  investment  he  had  made,  Mr.  Staudt 
was  compelled  to  assume  the  full  management  of  the  small  tile  factory. 
He  was  undismayed,  however,  despite  the  fact  that  his  working  knowl- 
edge of  ceramics  was  quite  meager,  and  with  grim  determination  he  re- 
solved to  build  up  the  establishment,  if  possible  in  any  way,  and  make 
it  one  of  the  successful  enterprises  of  the  community.  He  took  a  hand 
in  aifairs  immediately,  donning  his  overalls  and  tackling  any  job  that 
needed  to  be  done.  Nothing  was  too  hard,  for  it  was  a  case  of  neces- 
sity and  resolve — the  plant  must  flourish.  Mr.  Staudt  established  a  defi- 
nite working  policy  for  the  organization.  He  rebuilt  what  remained  of 
the  little  defunct  plant  on  the  solid  foundation  of  honor  and  integrity  in 
business — the  best  products  at  the  right  price,  and  the  same  treatment 
of  every  customer,  whether  large  or  small.  These  principles  live  with 
the  business  now,  just  as  they  did  in  the  early  days,  and  they  are  one  of 
the  secrets  of  the  remarkable  success  which  the  industry  has  attained. 

Step  by  step  the  business  thrived,  and  then  came  into  its  own.  The 
success  has  been  spectacular,  and  due  to  the  guiding  hand  and  persever- 
ing energy  of  Mr.  Staudt.  The  plant  was  developed  and  extended  from 
year  to  year,  and  to-day  occupies  a  position  as  one  of  the  most  modern 
and  best  equipped  ceramic  plants  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  The  floor 
space  has  grown  from  6784  square  feet  to  close  to  42,000  square  feet, 
more  than  six-fold ;  even  now,  the  capacity  is  taxed  to  the  utmost  to 
furnish  the  demands  of  customers,  and  still  more  expansion  will  be  neces- 
sary in  the  future.  Mr.  Staudt  can  well  take  pride  in  this  achievement, 
for  with  the  plant  he  has  grown  to  enjoy  an  enviable  position  among  the 
leading  business  men  in  the  State.  In  his  treatment  of  his  employees,  he 
has  shown  that  he  has  at  heart  their  utmost  welfare  and  security ;  he  has 
assisted  them  to  purchase  homes  for  their  families,  arranging  large  yearly 
bonuses  for  faithfully  performed  duties.  Moreover,  he  has  taken  out  a 
large  block  of  building  and  loan  stock  for  operatives  at  the  plant  with- 
out their  knowledge,  and  which,  when  due,  will  be  given  to  deserving 
employees. 

Mr.  Staudt  is  a  member  of  the  American  Ceramic  Society,  and  past 
president  of  the  New  Jersey  Clay  Workers'  Association  and  Eastern  Sec- 
tion of  the  American  Ceramic  Society,  and  has  long  occupied  a  position 
on  the  board  of  directors  of  the  latter  organization.  He  is  a  thirty-third 
degree  Mason,  a  member  of  the  East  Jersey  Club,  Raritan  Yacht  Club, 
Elks'  Club  and  other  well-known  organizations.  His  name  will  also  be 
found  in  the  membership  list  of  many  worthy  societies,  giving  them  the 
benefit  of  his  support  and  influence. 

Mr.  and  Mrs.  Staudt  have  one  child,  Augusta  Johanna,  who  was  bom 
in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  August  16,  1906.  The  family  are  members  of 
the  Evangelical  Lutheran  church. 


EDWARD  ALOYSIOUS  BRADY,  proprietor  and  manager  of  the 
New  Brunswick  Coal,  Ice  and  Lumber  Company,  which  is  located  at  No. 
328  Commercial  avenue,  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  holds  a  recog- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  159 

nized  place  among  the  prominent  business  men  of  this  community. 
Being  a  good  citizen,  as  well  as  an  able  executant,  Mr.  Brady  is  ever 
ready  to  cooperate  in  whatever  pertains  to  the  advancement  of  the  public 
welfare. 

Patrick  Brady,  father  of  Edward  Aloysious,  was  born  March  19,  1829, 
and  died  July  22,  1920,  at  Stapleton,  Staten  Island,  where  for  many  years 
he  had  been  established  in  the  coal  and  ice  business,  being  one  of  the 
largest  railroad  contractors  in  this  country.  He  married  Annie  M.  Mc- 
Atamney,  a  native  of  Ireland,  and  now  a  resident  of  Stapleton.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Brady  were  the  parents  of  fourteen  children,  three  of  whom  are 
still  living:  Edward  Aloysious,  of  further  mention;  Genevieve,  wife  of 
Hugh  E.  Conness ;  and  Anna  Rose,  wife  of  Charles  E.  McAteer. 

Edward  Aloysious  Brady,  son  of  Patrick  and  Annie  M.  (McAtamney) 
Brady,  was  born  March  12,  1877,  at  Newark,  New  Jersey.  At  the  age  of 
two  years  he  moved  with  his  parents  to  Bayonne,  New  Jersey,  and  there 
attended  the  public  schools  until  he  was  seventeen  years  of  age,  when  he 
terminated  his  schooling  and  began  his  business  career.  His  first  em- 
ployment was  with  the  Consumers'  Coal  and  Ice  Company  at  Bayonne, 
where  he  remained  for  three  years,  resigning  at  the  end  of  that  time  to 
visit  the  various  coal  sections  throughout  the  country.  On  March  3, 
1903,  he  came  to  New  Brunswick  and  secured  a  position  with  the  New 
Brunswick  Ice  Company.  During  the  next  four  years  he  made  himself 
familiar  with  it  in  every  detail,  and  when  four  years  later  he  bought  the 
entire  business,  he  was  capable  of  taking  it  and  managing  it  most  effi- 
ciently, which  is  proven  by  the  consistent  growth  of  the  enterprise. 
The  name  of  the  company  is  now  the  New  Brunswick  Coal,  Ice  and 
Lumber  Company. 

Mr.  Brady  has  never  held  any  public  office,  but  has  always  been 
keenly  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  community,  and  active  in  securing 
the  choice  of  the  best  men  available  for  such  posts.  He  affiliates  with

the  Ancient  Order  of  Hibernians,  Order  of  Eagles,  Lion  Club,  and  the 
Improved  Order  of  Red  Men.  In  his  religious  views  he  is  a  Roman 
Catholic,  and  attends  the  Sacred  Heart  Church  of  that  denomination  at 
New  Brunswick. 

On  October  17,  1906,  Edward  Aloysious  Brady  was  united  in  marriage 
with  Mary  A.  R.  Smith,  of  New  Brunswick,  daughter  of  the  late  Thomas

ABRAHAM  S,  KERR— The  story  of  Abraham  S.  Kerr  is  a  history  of 
obstacles  overcome  and  a  definite  end  achieved,  not  only  in  an  ordinary 
degree,  but  followed  to  a  highly  specialized  point.  As  one  of  the  most 
prominent  pharmacists  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  he  now  stands 
in  the  lead  in  a  profession  which  demands  of  every  man  engaged  in  it  the 
greatest  skill  and  precision,  as  well  as  exhaustive  technical  knowledge. 

Mr.  Kerr  was  born  in  the  State  of  Vitebsk,  Russia,  May  10,  1890.  He 
attended  the  schools  of  that  locality  until  he  was  fifteen  years  of  age.

when  he  came  to  America  to  join  his  parents,  who  had  theretofore  come 
to  New  York  City  to  found  a  home  for  their  family.  In  New  York  the 
boy  went  to  work  in  a  drug  store,  but  not  content  with  the  subordinate 
position  which  he  was  able  to  fill  in  the  beginning,  set  high  his  standard 
of  achievement,  and  proceeded  to  reach  it.  He  attended  night  school 
faithfully  and  punctually,  and  in  191 1  passed  his  Regent's  examination. 
In  191 2,  with  what  assistance  his  family  was  able  to  give  him,  together 
with  his  savings,  the  young  man  entered  Fordham  University  and  was 
graduated  in  Pharmacy  in  1914.  Following  his  graduation  he  took  a 
special  post-graduate  course  in  Bacteriology  covering  the  year  191 5.  This 
preparation  placed  Mr.  Kerr  in  line  for  big  work.  He  accepted  a  position 
in  New  York  City,  in  Analytical  Bacteriology,  continuing  along  this  line 
for  one  year.  Next  he  became  associated  with  the  Liggett  Company, 
as  manager.  His  ambition,  however,  was  to  place  himself  at  the  head  of 
an  establishment  of  his  own,  and  to  that  end  he  came  to  New  Brunswick, 
June  23,  1917,  and  purchased  his  present  store  on  the  corner  of  Church 
and  Neilson  streets.  He  greatly  enlarged  the  location,  redecorating  and 
improving  the  building,  and  making  it  up-to-date  in  every  respect.  Al- 
though beginning  at  so  recent  a  date,  comparatively,  Mr.  Kerr  has  placed 
himself  in  the  front  line  in  this  business  in  New  Brunswick,  and  com- 
mands a  splendid  trade.  His  future  looks  very  bright,  and  with  the 
foundations  upon  which  he  has  built,  success  in  large  measure  is  only  a 
matter  of  time.  Personally,  Mr.  Kerr  is  a  man  of  broad  interests,  keep- 
ing in  touch  with  every  phase  of  public  activity  and  scientific  develop- 
ment.   He  finds  his  relaxation  in  outdoor  sports. 

Mr.  Kerr's  people  are  all  connected  with  the  drug  business  in  Greater 
New  York.  His  father,  Solomon  Kerr,  who  was  born  in  Russia,  now 
lives  retired  in  New  York  City,  and  was  formerly  a  glass  manufacturer. 
He  married  Hannah  Lockshin,  also  bom  in  Russia,  and  now  a  resident 
of  New  York  City.  Of  their  children,  Abraham  S.  Kerr,  of  New  Bruns- 
wick, is  the  second.  The  oldest,  Luba,  is  now  the  wife  of  Saul  Goldfarb, 
of  Brooklyn,  New  York.  Of  the  younger  sons  and  daughters  Julius  re- 
sides in  Brooklyn,  and  Sophie,  Joseph  and  Bertha  reside  in  New  York 
City. 

Mr.  Kerr  married,  in  New  York  City,  June  4,  1917,  Dorothy  I.  Weiner. 
who  was  born  in  Riga,  Russia,  and  is  the  daughter  of  Jacob  and  Mary 
Weiner,  now  residents  of  Brooklyn,  New  York.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Kerr  have 
one  daughter,  Florence,  born  April  14,  1919.

Ashtabula  county,  Ohio,  and  was  graduated  with  the  class  of  1885,  taking 
the  degree  of  B.  S.  Immediately  after  completing  his  studies  at  the  lat- 
ter institution,  he  secured  a  position  with  the  Waterbury  Qock  Company 
of  Waterbury,  Connecticut,  but  remained  with  that  concern  only  one 
year.  He  left  this  position  in  order  to  accept  a  position  as  superintendent 
for  the  firm  of  Wallace  &amp;  Sons,  dealers  in  brass  and  copper  at  Ansonia, 
Connecticut,  in  which  he  continued  for  ten  years.  The  next  two  years 
were  spent  by  him  as  superintendent  of  the  Hendricks  Brothers  Copper 
Mills  at  Soho,  New  Jersey,  from  which  he  resigned  to  become  the  general 
manager  of  the  Waclark  Wire  Company  of  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey. 
After  three  years  there  he  became  general  manager  of  the  National 
Conduit  and  Cable  Company  of  Hastings-on-Hudson,  and  two  years 
later  resigned  to  become  connected  with  the  Standard  Underground 
Cable  Company  of  Perth  Amboy,  an  association  that  has  con- 
tinued to  the  present  time.  His  first  position  with  the  Standard 
Company  was  as  manager  of  its  wire  mill,  but  in  1916  he  was  appointed 
vice-president  of  the  concern  and  still  holds  that  office.  Be- 
sides his  association  with  this  company,  Mr.  Baldwin  has  taken  an  active 
interest  in  the  development  of  the  financial  interests  of  Perth  Amboy  and 
is  now  a  director  of  the  First  National  Bank  of  the  city.  In  politics  he 
is  a  Republican,  and  although  not  a  politician  in  any  sense,  has  taken 
part  in  the  conduct  of  public  affairs  and  has  held  membership  on  the 
Water  Board  of  the  city  for  some  years.  He  is  a  prominent  figure  in 
Masonic  circles,  having  attained  the  thirty-second  degree  in  Free  Ma-

JAMES  ALEXANDER  MORRISON,  numbered  among  the  pro- 
gressive and  prosperous  business  men  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  is 
a  man  whose  years,  sixty-one,  have  been  years  of  fruitful  endeavor  and 
high  attainment.  Mr.  Morrison  is  one  of  those  successful  men  from 
whose  biography  the  young  man  may  learn  how  to  best  direct  his  efiforts 
in  order  to  attain  the  worthwhile  things  of  life. 

Daniel  Morrison,  father  of  James  Alexander  Morrison,  was  born  in 
County  Armagh,  Ireland,  and  when  but  a  lad  emigrated  by  himself  to 
this  country.  Upon  landing  in  New  York  City  he  remained  there  for  a 
while,  but  later  removed  to  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  in  1869 
he  established  himself  in  the  grocery  business  at  the  corner  of  French 
and  James  streets  and  here  continued  successfully  until  his  death,  whicTi 
occurred  in  December,  1874.  He  married  Anna  Miller  Dale,  a  native  of 
Ireland,  her  birth  having  occurred  there  in  1832.  Mrs.  Morrison  now 
resides  in  New  Brunswick.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Morrison  were  born  five 
children :  James  Alexander,  of  further  mention ;  Mary  E.,  deceased ; 
John  J.,  William  D.,  and  Daniel  L. 

James  Alexander  Morrison  was  born  February  6,  i860,  in  New  Bruns- 
wick, New  Jersey,  and  attended  the  local  public  schools  until  he  had 
reached  the  age  of  seventeen  years.  He  then  entered  his  father's  grocery 
store,  which  he  continued  to  manage  for  many  years,  after  which  his 
brother  became  proprietor  of  the  store,  and  he  has  since  given  consider- 
able attention  to  the  publishing  business.  In  October,  1886,  he  became 
associated  with  the  H.  L.  Fairchild  medical  business,  manufacturers  of 
proprietary  medicines,  having  full  control  as  superintendent  of  same. 
Mr.  Morrison  is  also  a  director  of  the  Homestead  Building  and  Loan 
Association  and  the  Second  People's  Building  and  Loan  Association. 

But  it  has  not  been  only  in  the  business  world  that  Mr.  Morrison's 
time  and  energies  have  been  expended.  On  the  contrary  there  has  been 
no  one  more  interested  than  he  in  community  affairs,  and  as  a  staunch 
Republican  he  has  taken  an  active  part  in  politics.  From  1906  until  1910 
he  was  city  clerk.  For  ten  years  he  has  been  a  member  of  the  Board  of 
Education  and  its  president  two  years ;  a  member  of  the  local  Board  of 
Health  for  five  years  and  its  president  two  years ;  a  member  of  the  New 
Brunswick  Public  Library  Board  one  year ;  in  1920  clerk  of  the  Excise 
Commissioners  and  a  member  of  the  Public  Market  Committee,  and  on 
May  ID,  1921,  was  appointed  acting  postmaster  of  the  post  office  in  New 
Brunswick.  Besides  these  business  and  political  activities,  Mr.  Morrison 
is  affiliated  with  Palestine  Lodge,  No.  iii.  Free  and  Accepted  Masons, 
and  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics.  He  also  holds 
membership  in  the  Craftsmen's  Club  of  New  Brunswick,  and  the  local 
Young  Men's  Christian  Association.  In  his  religious  belief  he  is  a 
Presbyterian  and  attends  the  local  First  Church  of  that  denomination. 

On  April  19,  1883,  James  Alexander  Morrison  was  united  in  marriage 
with  Rebecca  H.  J.  MacCowan,  daughter  of  William  and  Gene  (Tate) 
MacCowan,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Morrison 
are  the  parents  of  four  children:  Lillian  M.,  Helen  J.,  Jessie  L.  and 
George  R.

The  career"  of  Mr.  Morrison  from  its  beginning  is  characterized  by- 
much  hard  and  persistent  expenditure  of  energy,  and  the  substantial  posi-

William  Van  Siclen  was  educated  in  the  public  schools,  and  upon 
arriving  at  suitable  age  became  a  carpenter's  apprentice,  learning  the 
trade  thoroughly  and  becoming  an  expert  workman.  Later  he  became 
a  contractor,  and  during  his  active  life  built  many  residences  and  other 
structures  in  Metuchen  and  vicinity.  He  was  a  man  of  strong  character, 
and  always  careful  in  his  business  dealings  to  make  no  promises  which 
he  felt  he  could  not  keep.  His  reputation  for  upright,  honorable  dealing 
was  very  high,  and  he  never  betrayed  the  confidence  his  neighbors  re- 
posed in  him.  He  was  a  Democrat  in  politics,  and  held  many  town 
offices,  including  that  of  assessor  of  taxes.  He  was  an  honored  member 
of  the  Masonic  order,  and  an  earnest  attendant  of  the  Methodist  Epis- 
copal church. 

Mr.  Van  Siclen  married,  in  Bonhampton,  New  Jersey,  January  4,  1865, 
Phoebe  Elizabeth  Acken,  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  July  17, 
1845,  daughter  of  Jonathan  Hatfield  and  Elizabeth  B.  (N'oe)  Acken.  The 
Ackens  came  to  the  United  States  in  the  ship  "Caledonia,"  which  sank 
later  in  the  harbor  at  Amboy,  the  wreck  being  yet  visible.  Jonathan 
Hatfield  Acken  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  was  a  farmer 
and  mason;  his  wife,  Elizabeth  B.  (Noe)  Acken,  was  born  at  Oak  Tree, 
New  Jersey.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Acken  were  the  parents  of  two  sons  and  two 
daughters:  Alonzo,  Hannah,  Thomas,  and  Phoebe  Elizabeth,  the  last- 
named  the  widow  of  William  Van  Siclen,  who  resides  in  Metuchen  and 
is  now  (1921)  in  her  seventy-sixth  year,  having  been  a  widow  for  twelve 
years  after  a  happy  married  life  of  forty-two  years  spent  in  Metuchen, 
her  husband's  birthplace. 


ROBERT  J.  SOLMSON.— The  Janeway  Button  Company  of  New 
Brunswick,  of  which  Robert  J.  Solmson  is  vice-president,  was  organized 
July  10,  1900,  and  is  the  development  of  a  business  founded  by  William 
R.  Janeway  and  conducted  under  his  own  name  for  three  years  before 
the  organization  of  the  present  concern.  The  officers  are:  William  R. 
Janeway,  president ;  Robert  J.  Solmson,  vice-president ;  and  John  L.  Dur- 
yee,  treasurer.  Their  specialty  is  the  making  of  vegetable  ivory  buttons, 
beans,  etc.,  and  the  company  occupies  a  strong  position  in  the  trade. 


HOWARD  CROSBY  VOORHEES,  M.  D.— As  a  result  of  a  number 
of  years  of  successful  and  devoted  practice.  Dr.  Voorhees  is  too  firmly 
intrenched  in  the  confidence  and  friendship  of  his  fellow-citizens  of  New 


i66  MIDDLESEX 

Brunswick  to  require  any  introduction  at  the  hands  of  his  biographer. 
He  is  quietly  but  helpfully  identified  with  the  most  essential  interests  of 
his  home  city  and  is  ever  ready  to  use  his  influence  in  behalf  of  all  that 
he  deems  conducive  to  the  public  progress  and  welfare. 

Howard  Crosby  Voorhees  was  born  January  4,  1879,  in  New  Bruns- 
wick, and  is  a  son  of  the  late  .Abraham  and  Martha  J.  (Van  Nostrand) 
Voorhees,  and  a  brother  of  Judge  Willard  P.  Voorhees  and  Qifford 
Irving  Voorhees,  both  of  whom  are  represented  in  this  work  by  biogra- 
phies, that  of  the  latter  including  a  full  ancestral  record. 

The  early  education  of  Howard  Crosby  Voorhees  was  received  at 
Rutgers  Preparatory  School,  from  which  he  graduated  in  1898.  In  1902 
he  received  from  Princeton  University  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts, 
and  in  1906  the  College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons  conferred  upon  him 
the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine.  His  medical  preceptor  was  Dr.  Frank 
M.  Donohue,  deceased,  he  being  associated  with  him  in  practice  for  five 
years. 

After  one  year  as  interne  in  Bellevue  Hospital,  Dr.  Voorhees,  in  1907, 
opened  an  office  in  New  Brunswick  and  has  since  been  actively  engaged 
in  the  practice  of  his  profession  in  that  city,  building  up,  at  the  same  time, 
a  lucrative  and  constantly  increasing  practice  and  an  assured  and  well 
deserved  reputation  for  skill,  knowledge  and  devotion  to  duty. 

The  principles  upheld  by  the  Republican  party  are  those  to  which  Dr. 
Voorhees  gives  his  political  allegiance.  During  the  recent  World  War, 
he  served  on  the  examining  board,  and  was  also  a  member  of  the  Volun- 
teer Medical  Service  Board.  He  belongs  to  the  Middlesex  County  and 
New  Jersey  State  Medical  societies,  and  the  American  Medical  Asso- 
ciation. He  is  a  member  of  the  Rutgers  Medical  Club,  and  Princeton 
Campus  Club.  He  and  his  family  are  members  of  the  Presbyterian 
church.  Dr.  Voorhees  is  also  a  member  of  the  medical  staff  of  St.  Peter's 
General  Hospital,  and  the  Parker  Memorial  Home. 

One  of  Dr.  Voorhees's  dominant  characteristics  is  an  enthusiastic 
devotion  to  music.  He  is  a  pianist  of  some  local  note  and  finds  in  his  art 
refreshment  and  relaxation  from  the  cares  and  responsibilities  of  an 
exacting  profession. 

Dr.  Voorhees  married,  January  19,  1918,  at  Princeton,  New  Jersey, 
Florence  M.  Ward,  born  in  England,  daughter  of  Thomas  and  Annie 
(Cook)  Ward,  of  Newark,  Mr.  Ward  having  retired  from  business.  The 
marriage  ceremony  was  performed  by  President  John  G.  Hibben,  of 
Princeton  University.  Dr.  and  Mrs.  Voorhees  are  the  parents  of  one 
child :    Florence  Adelaide,  born  January  9,  1920,  in  New  York  City. 

The  professional  career  of  Dr.  Voorhees  has  been  filled  with  activities, 
but  he  is  in  the  prime  of  life  and  his  record  gives  assurance  that  the  com- 
ing years  will  be  still  richer  in  accomplishment. 


ROSCOE  GLENN  DAVISON.— The  Davison  name  has  long  been 
associated  with  the  business  interests  of  Middlesex  county,  particularly 
in  Jamesburg,  where  Benjamin  D.  Davison  in  1892  established  a  build- 
ing materials  business  which  in  later  years  became  the  corporation  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  167

R.  Glenn  Davison  was  born  in  Jamesburg,  Middlesex  county.  New 
Jersey,  September  9,  1889,  son  of  Benjamin  D.  and  Eudora  (Worts) 
Diavison,  his  father  a  merchant.  After  courses  of  study  in  Jamesburg 
public  schools,  grade  and  high,  were  completed,  the  young  man  pursued 
a  business  course  at  the  Rider,  Moore  and  Stewart  School,  and  then  in 
May,  1905,  entered  his  father's  employ,  the  latter  then  operating  a  gen- 
eral supply  store  in  Jamesburg,  dealing  in  building  materials,  coal  and 
hardware,  furniture,  paints,  etc.  For  eleven  years  he  continued  in  the 
business  as  an  employee,  which  was  a  prosperous  one.  In  April,  1916, 
it  was  incorporated  as  the  B.  D.  Davison  Lumber  Company,  R.  Glenn 
Davison  becoming  vice-president  and  treasurer,  a  position  he  yet  ably 
fills.  He  is  also  secretary-treasurer  of  Davison  Estates,  a  position  he  has

family  home  is  in  Jamesburg. 


WILLIAM  E.  MOUNT  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  foremost  business 
men  in  Middlesex  county,  being  the  oldest  and  largest  authorized  Ford 
automobile  dealer  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  In  everything  pertaining 
to  the  welfare  and  advancement  of  the  community  he  takes  an  active  part, 
and  has  already  done  much  to  promote  the  prosperity  of  New  Brunswick. 

Mr.  Mount  was  born  June  24,  1863,  the  son  of  Joseph  B.  and  Mar- 
garet Mount.  He  obtained  his  education  in  the  public  schools.  In  1884 
Mr.  Mount  moved  to  the  little  village  of  Englishtown*  where  he  pur- 
chased a  store,  which  in  a  year's  time  he  had  turned  into  a  department 
store.  In  1889  the  store  was  totally  destroyed  by  fire,  but  this  did  not 
discourage  Mr.  Mount,  for  a  year  later  he  had  erected  a  new  store, 
modern  in  every  way,  and  built  of  brick  and  terra  cotta  tile.  In  time 
the  people  found  it  to  their  advantage  to  live  in  Englishtown,  and  a  gen- 
eral rebuilding  of  the  town  took  place.  By  1895  many  of  the  old  build- 
ings were  supplanted  by  modern  dwellings,  the  streets  were  paved  and 
good  roads  made  leading  to  New  Brunswick  and  other  towns  near  at 
hand.  Nine  years  later,  when  Henry  Ford  offered  the  agency  to  any 
person  willing  to  sell  his  motor  cars,  Mr.  Mount  took  it  and  received  one 
of  the  first  Ford  cars  that  was  seen  in  the  southern  part  of  New  Jersey. 
Mr.  Ford  soon  noticed  that  Mr.  Mount  thought  well  of  his  product  and 
so  decided  to  appoint  him  distributor  for  four  counties,  in  which  he 
finally  appointed  twenty  sub-dealers.  Mr.  Mount's  first  contract  called 
for  twenty-five  cars ;  to-day  his  contracts  covering  the  four  branches  he 
owns  amount  to  eleven  hundred  cars,  which  only  covers  the  minimum 


i68  MIDDLESEX 

sales  he  makes.  A  total  number  of  six  thousand  cars  have  been  deliv- 
ered by  him  in  the  fifteen  years  that  he  has  been  handling  them.  To-day 
finds  Mr.  Mount  the  owner  of  four  modern  Ford  service  stations,  vsrhich 
are  equipped  with  all  modern  Ford  repairing  tools  and  machinery.  Next 
to  Englishtown,  William  E.  Mount  takes  a  keen  interest  in  the  affairs 
of  New  Brunswick,  and  in  consequence  built  the  first  modern  fireproof 
building  on  Albany  street,  foresight  again  telling  him  that  this  street 
would  be  the  real  business  center. 

Mr.  Mount  has  served  two  years  as  Assemblyman,  is  a  director  of  the 
First  National  Bank  of  Englishtown,  and  belongs  to  several  of  the  local 
fraternal  organizations.

JULIUS  THEODORE  SIMMEN,  wholesale  baker  and  a  successful 
business  man  of  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  was  bom  in  Cassel,  Ger- 
many, February  28,  1873,  son  of  Theodore  and  Marie  (Leckert)  Sim- 
men,  his  father  a  potter.  When  eight  years  of  age  he  was  brought  to  the 
United  States  by  his  parents,  they  settling  first  in  Hoboken,  later  in 
Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 

Julius  T.  Simmen  attended  public  schools  until  thirteen  years  of  age, 
then  began  his  business  career  by  entering  the  employ  of  his  father,  who 
was  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  pottery.  He  began  at  the  bottom, 
learning  the  business  and  working  his  way  up  to  a  partnership  in  the 
concern.  As  the  business  increased  in  volume,  they  added  the  manu- 
facture of  crucibles,  fire  bricks,  slabs,  bake  ovens  and  all  clay  material 
products.  He  continued  in  this  line  of  business  until  he  was  twenty- 
eight  years  old,  when  he  gave  up  the  manufacture  of  pottery  and  entered 
the  wholesale  baking  business,  and  now  is  the  head  of  the  largest  baking 
establishment  in  the  county  of  Middlesex,  and  one  of  the  most  success- 
ful business  men  of  Perth  Amboy.  At  the  time  he  gave  up  the  manu- 
facture of  pottery  he  had  a  number  of  bake  ovens  on  hand,  and  conceived 
the  idea  of  using  them  in  his  new  undertaking.  They  proved  very  satis- 
factory from  the  first  and  reduced  greatly  the  initial  cost  of  the  new  busi- 
ness which  proved  a  success  from  the  start.  Beginning  with  one  barrel 
of  flour  per  day,  he  is  now  consuming  seventy-five  barrels  of  flour  in 
twenty-four  hours,  and  turning  out  four  hundred  thousand  loaves  of 
bread  a  month.  He  is  a  director  of  the  City  National  Bank  of  Perth

who  was  one  of  that  group  of  French  refugees  who  fled  to  escape 
religious  persecution  and  were  brought  over  to  East  Jersey  by  Sir 
Philip  Carteret  in  1665,  when  he  came  to  assume  the  government  of

EVERETT  CLINTON  ENSIGN.— When  Mr.  Ensign  retired  from

172  MIDDLESEX 

— secretary  to  the  Board  of  Education  of  Woodbridge,  Middlesex  county, 
New  Jersey,  a  town  in  which  he  first  saw  the  light  and  where  he  still 
resides.  He  is  a  son  of  Samuel  E.  and  Pamelia  (Vining)  Ensign,  his 
father  an  old  time  teacher  and  later  a  general  merchant  of  Woodbridge. 
He  came  to  that  town  from  Simsbury,  Connecticut,  where  the  Ensign 
family  had  long  been  seated.  Pamelia  (Vining)  Ensign  was  of  old 
Massachusetts  family,  she  coming  from  Southwick. 

The  Ensigns  of  Simsbury,  Connecticut,  descend  from  James  Ensign, 
born  in  England,  who  was  among  the  first  settlers  of  Cambridge,  Massa- 
chusetts. The  family  was  located  in  Kent,  England,  as  early  as  1395, 
and  in  Norfolk,  Essex,  and  other  English  counties  very  early.  James 
Ensign  came  to  Hartford,  Connecticut,  with  Rev.  Thomas  Hooker's 
colony,  was  among  the  original  members  of  the  First  Church  there,  and 
ranks  with  founders  of  that  city.  He  was  a  man  of  importance  in  the 
early  settlement.  Hartford  was  the  family  home  of  this  branch  until 
the  fifth  generation,  when  Moses  Ensign,  son  of  Isaac,  moved  to  Sims- 
bury, Connecticut,  that  town  giving  him  a  grant  of  land  as  an  inducement 
to  settle  there  and  ply  his  blacksmith's  trade.  He  died  there,  May  12, 
1816,  at  the  age  of  sixty-nine.  He  was  undoubtedly  the  great-grand- 
father of  Samuel  E.  Ensign,  father  of  Everett  Clinton  Ensign,  of  Wood- 
bridge,  New  Jersey. 

Everett  C.  Ensign  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  February 
27,  1858,  and  there  yet  resides,  a  man  most  highly  esteemed  in  the  town 
of  his  birth.  He  was  educated  in  Woodbridge  public  schools.  State 
Normal  School  at  Trenton,  and  a  business  college  at  Newark,  New  Jer- 
sey. He  began  business  life  immediately  after  school  years  were  over,  his 
first  position  being  with  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad  Company  in  their 
Jersey  City  office.  He  remained  with  the  Pennsylvania  system  thirty- 
five  years,  being  connected  with  the  maintenance  of  equipment  depart- 
ment in  the  accounting  division.  He  won  many  promotions  and  increases 
in  salary,  but  finally,  in  September,  1914,  tendered  his  resignation  and 
sundered  the  associations  of  thirty-five  years. 

In  1899  Mr.  Ensign  was  elected  by  the  members  of  the  Woodbridge 
Board  of  Education  as  secretary  of  that  board,  a  position  he  has  now 
held  for  twenty-two  years.  In  191 7  he  was  appointed  by  the  township 
authorities  to  rearrange  an  assessment  system,  and  he  has  since  con- 
tinued that  work  in  addition  to  his  secretarial  duties.  He  is  deeply 
interested  in  civic  affairs  and  public  matters  generally,  and  takes  an 
active  part  in  all  movements  that  promise  to  advance  the  interests  of 
Woodbridge. 

Mr.  Ensign  is  a  Republican  in  politics.  He  is  affiliated  with  the 
Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows  and  the  Royal  Arcanum  of  Wood- 
bridge.  In  religious  affiliation  the  family  is  connected  with  the  Metho- 
dist Episcopal  church  of  Woodbridge. 

Mr.  Ensign  married,  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  Ida  Ayres,  daughter 
of  John  D.  and  Maria  Ayres,  her  father  a  clay  miner  and  dealer  of 
Woodbridge,  and  of  an  ancient  New  Jersey  family.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Ensign 
are  the  parents  of  three  children:     i.  Everett  M.,  who  is  now  editor 


BIOGRAPHICAL  173 

of  the  Life  Insurance  "News"  of  New  York  City,  and  secretary  of  the 
National  Association  of  Life  Insurance  Underwriters.  He  married 
Evelyn  Stout,  of  Rahway,  New  Jersey.  2.  Ralph  W.,  who  was  a  mem- 
ber of  the  famous  Seventh  Regiment  of  New  York  City,  and  was  com- 
missioned captain  in  the  United  States  army  during  the  World  War, 
1917-1918,  stationed  at  Camp  Upton,  Long  Island;  he  is  now  manager 
of  the  Garden  City  Company,  Garden  City,  Long  Island.  3.  Helen  V., 
who  has  been  a  teacher  in  Woodbridge  schools  since  1904. 


EDWARD  A.  PFEIFFER.— A  great  contributing  factor  to  the 
prosperity  of  Middlesex  county  has  been  the  vast  deposits  of  clay  of 
superior  quality  for  the  manufacture  of  fire  brick,  tile,  drain  pipe,  terra 
cotta  and  other  articles  of  common  use.  Edward  A.  Pfeiffer,  now  passed 
into  eternal  rest,  was  one  of  the  men  who  aided  in  developing  the  clay 
products  industry.  For  many  years  he  mixed  clay,  and  was  connected 
with  Henry  Maurer  &amp;  Son,  at  Maurer,  New  Jersey.  His  service  with 
them  continued  for  about  thirty-five  years,  until  his  death  in  1917.  He 
was  an  important  man  in  the  business,  and  was  held  in  high  esteem, 
and  had  many  friends  in  business  and  social  life. 

Edward  A.  Pfeiffer,  son  of  John  and  Sophia  (Waltz)  Pfeiffer  was 
born  at  Fords,  New  Jersey,  July  27,  1865,  died  there,  July  17,  1917.  He 
grew  up  on  the  home  farm  and  obtained  a  good  public  school  education, 
finishing  in  high  school.  He  later  became  interested  in  the  clay  business, 
and  was  a  miner  of  clay.  The  business  he  established,  and  long  success- 
fully conducted,  is  still  managed  by  his  son,  who  was  trained  in  the 
business  under  his  honored  father. 

In  politics  Mr.  Pfeiffer  was  a  Republican,  and  so  interested  in  the 
welfare  of  his  community  that  for  fifteen  years  he  served  upon  the  Town 
Council.  He  was  a  devout  church  man,  and  long  a  member  of  the 
Presbyterian  church  of  Metuchen.  He  was  a  member  of  the  Masonic 
order,  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  and  the  Royal 
Arcanum.  He  was  interested  in  all  of  these  orders,  and  in  everything 
that  was  of  interest  and  benefit  to  the  community  in  which  he  lived.  He 
was  a  good  business  man,  citizen,  a  friend  and  neighbor,  and  above  all 
a  good  home  man. 

Mr.  Pfeiffer  married,  December  i,  1892,  Mary  E.  Liddle,  born  at 
Fords,  New  Jersey,  February  12,  1874,  daughter  of  John  and  Margaret 
(Emmons)  Liddle.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Pfeiffer  were  the  parents  of  seven 
children:  Edward  L.,  born  December  11,  1893,  died  August  14,  1896; 
Russell  E.,  born  September  20,  1895,  died  January  29,  1897;  Sophie  I., 
born  May  9,  1897,  married  Henry  C.  Koster,  of  Perth  Amboy;  Clifford 
O.,  born  April  19,  1899,  married  Bess  L.  Warren,  of  Perth  Amboy; 
J.  Spencer,  born  May  3,  1901 ;  Elizabeth  M.,  born  January  24,  1904;  and 
Robert  W.,  born  April  7,  1910.  Mrs.  Mary  E.  (Liddle)  Pfeiffer  survives 
her  husband,  and  continues  her  residence  at  the  old  Pfeiffer  home, 
between  Fords  and  Metuchen,  near  the  village  of  Fords,  in  which  place 
she  was  born,  and  where  her  life  has  been  largely  passed.

JOHN  H.  LOVE,  PH.  B.— The  career  of  John  H.  Love  became  inter- 
woven with  the  history  of  Woodbridge  High  School  in  1895,  and  since 
that  year  the  history  of  one  is  the  history  of  both,  so  far  as  is  literally 
possible.  A  quarter  of  a  century  has  elapsed  since  a  committee  from  the 
Woodbridge  Board  of  Education,  after  a  personal  investigation  of  Pro- 
fessor Love's  work  in  other  fields,  reported  favorably  upon  his  "appoint- 
ment to  the  principalship  of  the  Woodbridge  High  School,  and  during 
that  period  the  growth  and  advancement  of  the  school  and  of  the  schools 
of  the  township  of  Woodbridge  have  been  phenomenal,  for  since  1901, 
Professor  Love  has  been  supervising  principal  of  all  schools  of  the  town- 
ship. He  has  won  high  position  among  educators,  and  is  an  honor  to 
the  teaching  profession.  He  is  of  English  birth  and  parentage,  a  son 
of  William  S.  and  Mary  A.  (Brindley)  Love,  who  in  the  year  1887  left 
their  English  home  and  came  to  the  United  States. 

John  H.  Love  was  born  in  Hanley,  Staffordshire,  England,  December 
7,  1868,  and  there  spent  the  first  twenty  years  of  his  life.  He  was 
educated  in  the  public  schools  and  Teachers'  Training  classes,  winning 
a  Queen's  Scholarship.  He  was  for  two  years  an  assistant  master  of 
the  Cannon  Street  School  for  Boys,  and  received  the  highest  rating 
as  a  teacher.  With  this  training  and  record  he  came  to  the  United  States 
in  1889,  his  first  position  in  this  country  being  as  teacher  of  an  ungraded 
school  in  Salem  county,  New  Jersey.  In  September,  1890,  he  began  a 
two  years'  engagement  as  principal  of  the  North  Long  Branch 
.School,  and  in  September,  1892,  he  began  his  three  years'  term  as 
principal  of  the  public  school  at  Belmar,  New  Jersey.  There  he 
inaugurated  a  high  school  department,  and  brought  the  standard  of  the 
school  to  a  par  with  other  educational  institutions  of  its  class.  Then 
came  the  call  to  Woodbridge,  where  a  quarter  of  a  century  of  most  suc- 
cessful work  stands  to  his  credit. 

In.  1895,  when  Professor  Love  came  to  Woodbridge  as  principal  of 
the  high  school,  there  were  in  the  different  districts  of  the  township 
school  buildings  with  a  capacity  mostly  of  one  and  two  rooms,  the  only 
exception  being  School  No.  i,  in  Woodbridge,  which  had  twelve  rooms. 
The  Six  Roads  School  had  one  room ;  Locust  Grove,  one  room ;  Rahway 
Neck,  one  room;  Fords,  two  rooms;  Iselin,  one  room;  and  at  Carteret 
there  were  four  rooms  in  use.  After  six  years  as  principal  of  the  high 
school,  Professor  Love  was  made  supervising  principal  of  township 
schools  and  at  once  began  a  campaign  for  more,  larger  and  better 
equipped  school  buildings,  and  for  a  wider  curriculum,  and  a  larger 
teaching  staff.  These  results  have  all  been  attained  through  his  unceas- 
ing, uncompromising  efforts,  and  the  benefit  of  his  administration  is  in 
evidence  in  every  department. 

There  are  now  nine  school  buildings  in  the  township,  with  another  ih 
course  of  erection  at  Sewaren,  all  being  of  modern  fireproof  construction. 
These  buildings  contain  eighty-nine  class  rooms,  exclusive  of  manual 
training  rooms,  gymnasiums,  auditoriums,  and  other  special  rooms. 
These  are  all  modernly  furnished  and  equipped,  no  better  being  foiind 
anywhere.    Woodbridge  has  a  high  school  and  two  primary  schools,  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  175 

other  schools  being  in  Port  Reading,  Avenel,  Iselin,  Fords,  xvcasbey,  and 
Hope  Lawn.  About  thirty-five  hundred  children  of  school  age  are 
enrolled  in  the  township,  and  one  hundred  teachers  are  employed.  Spe- 
cial supervisors,  manual  training,  music  and  drawing  teachers  visit  all 
the  schools  at  stated  intervals,  thereby  giving  equal  advantages  to  the 
children  regardless  of  the  school  they  attend.  The  members  of  the 
Board  of  Education,  consisting  of  Howard  A.  Tappen,  president;  E.  C. 
Ensign,  H.  R.  Valentine,  Fred  Bohlen,  Charles  S.  Farrell,  Maurice  P. 
Dunigan,  Melvin  Clum,  Louis  Meyer,  and  A.  B.  Walling,  have  been 
absolutely  loyal  to  the  best  educational  interests  of  the  township,  acting 
in  perfect  harmony  with  the  supervising  principal.  Professor  Love.  The 
Woodbridge  township  school  system  has  no  superior  in  the  State. 

Professor  Love  is  a  member  of  Township  Professional  Circle  (presi- 
dent) ;  the  Supervising  Principals'  Association,  of  Middlesex  county;  the 
State  Teachers'  Association;  State  Council  of  Education,  and  the  Na- 
tional Teachers'  Association.  He  is  a  member  and  past  master  of 
Americus  Lodge,  No.  831,  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  and  was  formerly 
a  member  of  other  fraternal  organizations  which  pressing  duties  com- 
pelled him  to  relinquish.  He  is  president  of  Woodbridge  Chapter  of  the 
American  Red  Cross ;  senior  warden  of  Trinity  Episcopal  Church,  and  in 
politics  is  a  Republican,  serving  on  the  election  board  of  District  No.  i. 

During  the  War  of  1917-18,  Professor  Love  was  commissioned  sec- 
ond lieutenant  of  Company  A,  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  State  Militia 
Reserve,  that  company  rendering  notable  service  at  the  time  of  the  great 
explosion  of  munitions  at  Morgan,  near  Woodbridge. 

Professor  Love  married,  in  1893,  Anna  H.  Newcomer,  of  Columbia, 
Pennsylvania,  daughter  of  Emanuel  and  Christiana  (Hornberger)  New- 
comer, of  an  ancient  and  honorable  Pennsylvania  family.  Six  children 
were  born  to  Professor  and  Mrs.  Love:  Verna  B.,  married  William  E. 
Lape,  and  resides  in  Evanston,  Illinois;  Gregory  W.,  who  during  the 
World  War,  1917-18,  served  in  France  as  gunner's  mate  with  Naval 
Battery,  No.  4;  Marian  B.,  residing  at  home;  Victor  N.,  who  served 
in  the  United  States  navy  on  the  submarine  chaser  "Narada"  during  the 
World  War ;  Edgar,  and  Ruth  J.,  both  high  school  students. 

In  1901  Professor  Love  received  from  Illinois  Wesleyan  University 
the  degree  of  Ph.  B.,  and  other  honors  have  been  conferred  upon  him 
for  his  work  as  an  educator.  This  brief  record  of  the  life  of  John  H. 
Love  reveals  a  man  of  high  ideals  and  devotion  to  every  duty,  pro- 
fessional or  civic.  He  has  won  a  host  of  friends  in  his  adopted  town, 
and  is  as  favorably  as  he  is  widely  known. 


DANIEL  POTTER  OLMSTEAD.— In  his  Vermont  home,  St.  Al- 
bans, Daniel  P.  Olmstead,  president  of  the  Evening  News  Company,  of 
Perth  Amboy,  spent  his  youth,  finished  his  school  years  and  learned 
the  printer's  trade.  His  experience  in  the  printing  shop  of  the  St.  Albans 
"Messenger"  was  supplemented  by  a  period  with  a  large  printing  house 
in  New  York  City,  his  residence  in  Perth  Amboy  beginning  at  the  close 
of  that  period,  February,  1898.  From  that  date  he  has  been  intimately 
connected  with  the  publishing  business  of  Perth  Amboy. 


176  MIDDLESEX 

Olmstead  is  an  ancient  English  name  of  local  significance,  meaning 
a  place  or  town  by  the  green  oaks;  from  Holm,  an  oak,  and  stead,  a 
place.  It  is  found  under  varied  forms  of  spelling — Olmsted,  Olmstead, 
Omsted,  Homestead,  Holmsted,  Homsted,  etc.,  but  all  of  the  early  New 
England  families  of  the  name  descend  from  James  Olmsted,  born  in 
England,  who  came  to  Boston  in  the  ship  "Lion,"  September  i6,  1632. 
In  1636  he  went  with  the  colony  from  Massachusetts  and  was  one  of  the 
original  settlers  and  proprietors  of  Hartford,  Connecticut,  where  he  died. 
He  was  evidently  a  man  of  means,  as  in  his  will  he  bequeathed  fifty 
pounds  to  the  Hartford  church.  Descendants  settled  in  all  parts  of  New 
England,  this  branch  settling  in  Vermont,  where  Myron  B.  Olmstead 
was  living  at  the  time  of  the  birth  of  'his  son,  Daniel  P.  Olmstead. 

Daniel  Potter  Olmstead,  only  son  of  Myron  B.  and  Mary  (Potter) 
Olmstead,  was  born  in  St.  Albans,  Vermont,  May  7,  1871.  He  completed 
public  school  study  with  graduation  from  high  school  and  soon  after- 
ward entered  the  employ  of  the  St.  Albans  "Messenger"  as  printer's 
apprentice,  serving  a  term  of  four  years.  The  next  five  years  were  spent 
with  a  large  printing  establishment  of  New  York  City,  following  which 
he  located  in  February,  1898,  at  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  going  there 
to  take  charge  of  the  job  printing  department  of  the  old  Perth  Amboy 
"Republican."  He  became  financially  interested  in  the  "Republican," 
and  continued  with  its  job  printing  department  for  five  years,  becoming 
president  of  the  newly  organized  Evening  News  Company,  in  1903.  The 
Perth  Amboy  "Evening  News"  has  become  the  leading  daily  newspaper 
of  Middlesex  county,  and  since  its  foundation  the  company  has  been 
under  the  executive  management  of  Mr.  Olmstead,  a  practical  printer 
and  publisher. 

Mr.  Olmstead  is  a  member  of  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Perth 
Amboy  Savings  Institution,  a  director  and  member  of  the  finance  com- 
mittee of  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  and  ex-president  of 
the  old  Board  of  Trade,  and  interested  in  all  that  pertains  to  the  welfare 
of  his  city.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order 
of  Elks,  and  of  the  Masonic  order,  affiliated  with  Raritan  Lodge,  Free 
and  Accepted  Masons,  and  Amboy  Chapter,  Royal  Arch  Masons,  having 
filled  the  office  of  high  priest  of  the  chapter.  He  is  a  vestryman  of  St. 
Peter's  Episcopal  Church,  and  a  member  of  the  Colonia  Country,  East 
Jersey,  and  Raritan  Yacht  clubs. 

Mr.  Olmstead  married,  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  August  31,  1898, 
Frances  Charters,  born  in  Brooklyn,  daughter  of  David  J.  and  Alice 
(Stevenson)  Charters,  her  father  deceased,  her  mother  a  present  resident 
of  Brooklyn.    The  Charters  family  is  of  English  descent. 


RAYMOND  R.  MOORE.— For  forty  years  prior  to  his  passing,  in 
1899,  Ellis  F.  Moore  was  engaged  in  business  in  Woodbridge,  New 
Jersey,  as  a  general  merchant  and  hardware  dealer  of  the  firm  F.  &amp;  E.  F. 
Moore,  Hardware,  dating  from  1871.  For  thirteen  years  that  firm, 
composed  of  Franklin  and  Ellis  F.  Moore,  brothers,  continued  in  busi- 
ness, Franklin  Moore  then  selling  his  interest  and  withdrawing.     As 


BIOGRAPHICAL  177 

his  sons  came  to  suitable  years,  Ellis  F.  Moore  admitted  them  to  the 
business  and  when,  in  1899,  he  was  called  to  his  reward,  those  sons, 
Raymond  R.  and  Lawrence  Moore,  bought  the  interest  of  the  other 
heirs,  and  the  hardware  business,  with  a  Moore  at  its  head,  is  continued 
in  Woodbridge  until  the  present,  1921,  the  firm  name  E.  F.  Moore  &amp; 
Sons. 

Ellis  F.  Moore  was  a  son  of  Lawrence  Moore,  who  was  born  on 
Staten  Island,  New  York,  January  10,  1801,  but  at  the  age  of  thirteen 
crossed  the  narrow  water  that  separates  the  island  from  New  York,  and 
henceforth  made  his  home  in  the  latter  State.  He  learned  the  wheel- 
wright's trade,  and  in  1837  permanently  settled  in  Woodbridge,  Middle- 
sex county.  New  Jersey,  where  he  died  August  15,  1864.  He  conducted 
a  very  prosperous  business  in  Woodbridge  until  his  death,  when  his  son 
succeeded  him  in  the  management  of  the  business.  Lawrence  Moore 
married,  March  11,  1823,  Ann  Hutchinson,  who  long  survived  him,  she 
dying  September  29,  1880.  They  were  the  parents  of  six  sons  and  a 
daughter:  Daniel,  died  in  early  childhood;  William  Henry,  died  at  the 
age  of  twenty-three  years;  Francis,  died  in  early  childhood;  Lawrence, 
a  carriage  maker;  Franklin,  a  carriage  maker;  Martha  Ann,  married, 
August  7,  1859,  Isaac  H.  Harned ;  Ellis  F.,  of  further  mention. 

Ellis  F.  Moore,  youngest  son  of  Lawrence  and  Ann  (Hutchinson) 
Moore,  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  September  21,  1846,  and 
died  in  the  town  of  his  birth,  April  26,  1899.  After  his  school  years  were 
over,  he  embarked  on  a  business  career,  being  but  thirteen  years  of  age 
when,  in  1859,  ^^  became  a  mercantile  clerk,  becoming  later  a  merchant 
in  his  own  right  and  head  of  a  general  hardware  business.  He  was 
twenty-five  years  of  age  when  he  and  his  brother,  Franklin,  founded  the 
hardware  business  of  F.  and  E.  F.  Moore  (previously  mentioned),  of 
which,  in  1884,  he  became  sole  owner  and  head,  continuing  until  his  death 
fifteen  years  later,  leaving  sons  to  succeed  him  and  perpetuate  the  name 
Moore,  which  was  brought  to  Woodbridge  in  1837  by  Lawrence  Moore, 
his  father.  Ellis  F.  Moore  married  Rose  Vennetee,  and  this  review  will 
now  follow  the  career  of  their  son,  Raymond  R.  Moore,  his  father's 
successor  in  business,  and  of  the  third  generation  of  this  family  in  busi- 
ness in  Woodbridge. 

Raymond  R.  Moore  was  born  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  August 
31,  1878,  and  there  completed  a  public  school  course,  after  which  he 
pursued  a  course  of  study  in  a  New  Jersey  Business  College,  Newark, 
New  Jersey,  finishing  with  the  graduating  class  of  1896.  He  was  at 
once  taken  into  the  hardware  store  then  owned  and  conducted  by  his 
honored  father,  Ellis  F.  Moore,  and  for  three  years  he  was  a  bookkeeper 
in  that  store,  but  was  given  every  opportunity  to  become  familiar  with 
the  detail  of  the  business.  Ellis  F.  Moore  died  in  1899,  and  in  the  set- 
tlement of  the  estate  Raymond  R.  and  Lawrence  Moore  purchased  the 
hardware  business  founded  by  their  father  and  uncle  in  1871,  and  con- 
tinued it  under  the  firm  name  of  E.  F.  Moore  &amp;  Sons.  The  brothers 
operated  the  business  as  a  partnership  until  1918,  when  Lawrence  Moore 
withdrew  his  interest,  it  being  purchased  by  Raymond  R.  Moore  who

now,  in  the  fiftieth  anniversary  year  of  its  founding,  is  sole  owner  of 
the  business  which  in  that  time  has  not  been  out  of  the  Moore  name. 
His  store  is  now  located  at  the  corner  of  Main  and  Fulton  streets,  Wood- 
bridge,  but  previous  to  1918  was  at  No.  87  Main  street  for  thirty-two 
years,  the  original  store  of  F.  &amp;  E.  F.  Moore  having  been  on  Green 
street  (1871),  next  to  the  Masonic  Hall.  That  building  prior  to  1871 
had  been  in  use  as  a  store  since  1856  and  there,  in  1859,  Ellis  F.  Moore 
began  his  mercantile  career  as  clerk.  The  business,  of  which  Raymond 
R.  Moore  is  the  owner  and  head,  is  the  only  one  with  which  he  has 
ever  been  connected.  He  came  to  it  in  1896  fresh  from  business  college, 
and  enjoyed  the  years  of  business  training  under  his  honored  father 
before  being  called  to  its  management.  He  was  a  youth  of  eighteen 
when  he  entered  his  father's  employ,  twenty-one  when  he  became  a 
partner  with  his  brother  Lawrence,  forty  when  he  became  sole  owner, 
and  now,  at  the  age  of  forty-three,  has  no  other  business  interests.  He 
has  won  the  same  high  standing  and  business  .reputation  that  his  father 
enjoyed,  and  is  one  of  the  representative  men  of  his  community. 

When  the  outbreak  of  war  between  the  United  States  and  Spain, 
in  1898,  called  upon  the  manhood  of  the  nation,  Mr.  Moore  responded 
by  enlistment  in  the  Third  Regiment,  New  Jersey  Volunteers.  He 
enlisted  at  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey,  and  was  honorably  discharged  at 
Pompton  Lakes,  New  Jersey,  November  2,  1898.  He  enlisted  as  a  private 
and  rose  through  successive  promotions  to  the  rank  of  captain  of  his 
company.  When  again,  in  1917,  the  president's  call  went  out  for  men 
to  protect  American  honor  and  interests,  and  fight  in  the  cause  of  justice 
and  right.  Captain  Moore,  although  exempted  by  years,  responded  and 
was  commissioned  captain  of  Company  C,  Second  Regiment,  New  Jer- 
sey Volunteers,  and  served  from  March  28,  1917,  until  February  6,  1919, 
when  he  was  honorably  discharged  and  mustered  out  at  Camp  Wads- 
worth,  South  Carolina,  a  veteran  of  two  wars. 

Captain  Moore  is  affiliated  with  Americus  Lodge,  No.  83,  Free  and 
Accepted  Masons,  of  Woodbridge ;  Woodbridge  Lodge,  No.  153,  Knights 
of  Pythias ;  Rahway  Lodge,  No.  1075,  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order 
of  Elks;  and  Trinity  Protestant  Episcopal  Church  of  Woodbridge.  Po- 
litically he  is  independent  in  his  action,  and  scrutinizes  with  a  keen 
interest  the  men  who  present  themselves  for  public  office  and  the  meas- 
ures they  endorse.  He  is  public-spirited  and  progressive,  while  in 
patriotism  he  is  of  the  finest  quality,  as  has  been  proven. 

Mr.  Moore  married,  in  February,  1908,  Bertha  M.  Mundy,  her  par- 
ents former  residents  of  Woodbridge.  Captain  and  Mrs.  Moore  are  the 
parents  of  three  sons:  Ellis  F.  (2),  Raymond  R.  (2),  and  John  C.  Moore. 


M.  BURR  MANN. — There  is  no  more  vital  factor  in  the  community 
than  that  of  public  education.  The  training  of  the  youthful  mind  in  the 
formulative  stage  along  those  lines  which  will  prove  most  beneficial  to 
it  in  later  life  is  a  task  which  to  the  community  is  a  large  and  life-sized 
problem.  The  more  intelligent  and  capable  the  men  into  whose  hands 
the  direction  of  education  is  given,  the  greater  the  value  to  themselves. 


BIOGRAPHICAL  179 

and  the  world  is  the  recipient  of  their  training.  The  improvement  in 
the  quality  of  education  and  preliminary  training  has  increased  a  hun- 
dredfold within  the  past  few  decades,  due  to  an  awakening  on  the  part 
of  the  people  to  the  absolute  necessity  of  a  good  foundation  on  which 
to  begin  a  career,  and  due  also  in  a  large  degree  to  the  demand  for 
especially  trained  experts.  In  every  city  throughout  the  entire  country 
are  to  be  found  schools  of  high  standing,  and  at  the  head  of  these  schools 
are  to  be  found  educators  of  the  highest  order.  M.  Burr  Mann  is  one 
of  these  successful  educators,  and  not  only  is  Mr.  Mann  prominent  in  his 
profession,  but  in  the  public  affairs  of  Dunellen  he  also  takes  a  keen 
and  active  interest. 

M.  Burr  Mann  was  born  in  Fulton,  New  York,  April  i,  1880,  the 
son  of  Almerien  and  Hannah  (Chapman)  Mann.  He  received  the  ele- 
mentary portion  of  his  education  in  the  public  schools  of  his  native  place, 
and  after  graduating  from  the  high  school  there,  he  prepared  himself 
for  college,  and  in  1899  matriculatfed  at  Cornell  University,  from  which 
institution  he  was  graduated  in  1903.  Upon  completing  a  course  there, 
he  showed  himself  to  be  a  student  of  more  than  ordinary  ability,  and  he 
had  no  difficulty  in  securing  a  position  as  a  teacher.  His  ability  in 
handling  the  pupils  of  a  school  soon  brought  him  to  the  notice  of  edu- 
cational authorities,  and  he  came  to  have  a  reputation  of  being  well 
qualified  in  the  teaching  profession.  In  1917  he  received  the  offer  of  a 
position  as  superintendent  of  the  Dunellen  public  school,  which  afforded 
him  greater  opportunities  for  advancement,  and  he  accepted  it,  remain- 
ing in  that  position  ever  since.  Under  his  direction,  the  schools  have 
been  brought  to  a  much  higher  standard  of  efficiency. 

In  addition  to  his  interests  in  the  world  of  education  and  literature, 
Mr.  Mann  is  prominent  in  the  local  fraternal  organizations,  among  them 
being  the  Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  and  the  Independent  Order  of 
Odd  Fellows,  and  he  also  holds  membership  in  the  local  Republican  Club. 
His  religious  affiliations  are  with  the  Presbyterian  church,  and  both 
he  and  Mrs.  Mann  attend  the  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Dunellen. 

On  October  18,  1904,  M.  Burr  Mann  was  united  in  marriage  with 
Anna  Lee  Pitcher,  daughter  of  the  Rev.  Charles  W.  and  Anna  (Amer- 
man)  Pitcher.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Mann  are  the  parents  of  one  child,  Gwen- 
dolin,  born  December  31,  1906. 


PAUL  REUSCH.— A  resident  of  Dunellen,  president  of  the  First 
National  Bank  of  Dunellen,  Mr.  Reusch  is  properly  to  be  named  among 
the  representative  citizens  of  his  section  of  the  State,  his  life,  upright 
and  honorable,  industrious  and  energetic,  commanding  for  him  the  con- 
fidence and  respect  of  his  fellowmen  in  an  unusual  degree. 

Paul  Reusch  is  a  native  of  New  York  City,  his  birth  occurring  Feb- 
ruary 16,  1855,  a  son  of  Conrad  and  Mary  Anna  (Trust)  Reusch,  natives 
of  Germany,  from  which  country  they  emigrated  to  the  New  World  in 
early  life,  about  1845.  Conrad  Reusch  became  a  well-to-do  baker  in 
New  York  City  before  it  became  the  city  of  the  present  day,  with  its 
millions  of  inhabitants,  the  greater  part  of  them  having  to  depend  upon 


i8o  MIDDLESEX 

men  of  his  line  of  work  for  their  daily  sustenance.  The  son,  Paul  Reusch, 
was  a  student  in  a  pay  school  during  his  boyhood,  there  gaining  a  thor- 
ough knowledge  of  the  English  and  German  languages,  this  knowledge 
proving  of  value  to  him  in  his  active  career.  For  a  number  of  years  he 
gave  his  attention  to  the  trade  and  business  his  father  followed,  that  of 
a  baker,  in  which  he  became  an  expert,  and  subsequently,  desiring  a  wider 
and  broader  field  for  his  talents  and  abilities,  became  interested  in  bank- 
ing, in  1907,  his  scene  of  labor  being  the  First  National  Bank  of  Dunellen, 
in  which  he  advanced  in  rank  from  time  to  time,  first  as  a  director  and 
finally  being  chosen  to  serve  in  the  capacity  of  president,  the  duties  of 
which  he  faithfully  performed,  his  service  being  of  inestimable  value 
to  the  men  connected  with  him  in  the  enterprise.  Mr.  Reusch  follows 
the  tenets  of  the  Presbyterian  church,  gives  his  allegiance  to  the  candi- 
dates of  the  Republican  party,  and  is  affiliated,  fraternally  with  the  Order 
of  Foresters  and  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics. 

Mr.  Reusch  married,  November  18,  1883,  in  Warrenville,  Somerset 
county.  New  Jersey,  Catherine  Williams,  born  in  Warrenville,  March  7, 
1864,  a  daughter  of  Peter  and  Catherine  (Friday)  Williams,  the  former 
named  having  been  born  in  Germany,  from  whence  he  came  to  the 
United  States  at  the  age  of  sixteen,  here  following  the  occupation  of 
farming  throughout  the  active  years  of  his  life,  and  the  latter  named  a 
native  of  New  York  City.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Reusch  are  the  parents  of 
two  children:  Anna  Elizabeth,  born  February  25,  1891,  and  Paul  Edward, 
born  August  29,  1898.  The  family  residence,  a  fine  house  containing 
twelve  rooms,  modern  in  its  appointments,  equipped  with  everything 
necessary  for  the  comfort  of  its  inmates,  and  surrounded  by  well  kept 
lawns  and  fruit  trees  of  every  description,  was  purchased  by  Mr.  Reusch 
in  191 1 ;  it  is  located  at  No.  611  Washington  avenue,  Dunellen. 


ALBERT  H.  BOWERS. — Early  developing  mechanical  tastes  and 
talent,  Mr.  Bowers,  through  apprenticeship  and  experience,  became  a 
skilled  worker  in  metal.  In  the  capacity  of  toolmaker,  he  first  came  to 
Woodbridge  in  1910,  later  advancing  to  superintendent  of  the  McClellan 
Lines  Company,  and  subsequently  becoming  owner  of  his  own  business, 
under  the  naine  of  A.  H.  Bowers. 

Mr.  Bowers  is  a  son  of  Charles  and  Elizabeth  (Clark)  Bowers,  and 
grandson  of  Thomas  Bowers,  born  in  England,  an  artist,  who  came  to 
the  United  States  and  settled  in  Syracuse,  New  York,  subsequently  going 
to  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  where  he  died.  It  is  said  that  Thomas  Bowers 
painted  the  scenery  for  the  first  presentation  of  the  play  "Uncle  Tom's 
Cabin."  Charles  Bowers  was  born  during  residence  of  the  family  in 
Syracuse,  New  York.  He  was  educated  in  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  but 
afterwards  settled  permanently  in  Rahway,  New  Jersey,  where  his  son, 
Albert  H.,  was  born.  Elizabeth  (Clark)  Bowers  was  a  daughter  of 
Jesse  and  Rebecca  (Leob)  Clark,  and  a  lineal  descendant  of  Abraham 
Clark,  a  signer  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence. 

Albert  H.  Bowers  was  born  in  Rahway,  New  Jersey,  February  19, 
1885,  and  there  attended  the  public  schools.    At  an  early  age  he  began 


BIOGRAPHICAL  i8i 

learning  the  machinist's  trade,  at  the  same  time  attending  the  evening 
sessions  of  Trainer's  Business  College,  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  He 
was  graduated  from  business  college  in  1906,  and  having  completed  his 
years  of  apprenticeship  at  the  trade,  he  left  Perth  Amboy  and  during  the 
next  four  years  was  employed  in  different  machine  shops  in  New  Jersey 
towns.  In  1910  he  entered  the  employ  of  the  McClellan  Lines  Company, 
of  Woodbridge,  as  a  toolmaker,  soon  advancing  to  the  position  of  shop 
foreman.  He  was  later  made  plant  superintendent,  and  in  191 5  suc- 
ceeded to  the  ownership  of  the  business,  and  the  name  was  then  changed 
to  A.  H.  Bowers.  He  manufactures  locomotive  and  automobile  acces- 
sories, hoists,  cranes  and  other  machinery.  During  the  World's  War 
period  the  plant  was  engaged  exclusively  in  the  manufacture  of  tools 
and  machinery  for  the  loading  of  shells  and  other  ammunition.  The 
plant  is  located  at  Freeman  street  and  the  Pennsylvania  Railroad, 
twenty-five  men  being  continuously  employed.  The  products  have 
become  well  known  to  the  trade,  and  the  business  is  a  prosperous  one. 

Mr.  Bowers  is  a  Republican  in  politics,  and  takes  a  deep  interest  in 
the  affairs  of  the  community  in  which  he  is  highly  esteemed.  He  is  a 
member  of  the  Junior  Order  of  United  American  Mechanics;  with  his 
family  he  attends  the  services  of  the  Woodbridge  Presbyterian  Church.

and  Mrs.  Bowers  are  the  parents  of  two  children:  Albert,  born  May  30, 
1909;  Mildred,  born  December  19,  1915. 


WILLIAM  CARMAN. — Now  living  retired  at  his  home  in  Menlo 
Park,  New  Jersey,  enjoying  to  the  full  the  fruits  of  his  long  years  of 
honest  and  honorable  endeavor,  this  being  a  natural  sequence,  William 
Carman  can  review  the  past  with  satisfaction  and  enjoyment,  realizing 
that  the  part  he  took  in  the  affairs  of  his  adopted  town  were  for  its 
betterment  and  uplift  along  many  lines.  He  is  also  well  known  through- 
out Middlesex  county,  and  is  one  of  her  foremost  citizens. 

William  Carman  was  born  in  Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  August  31, 
1849,  a  son  of  Melancthon  and  Ann  Maria  (Ayres)  Carman,  the  former 
named  having  been  a  prosperous  lumber  dealer  and  the  operator  of  a 
saw  mill  located  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  which  enterprises  he  conducted 
in  a  thoroughly  reliable  manner  for  many  years.  In  i860  Melancthon 
Carman  erected  a  house  for  the  use  of  himself  and  family  in  Menlo  Park, 
and  this  has  been  the  family  homestead  to  the  present  time  (1920),  a 
period  of  sixty  years. 

William  Carman  was  a  student  in  the  public  schools  of  Newark, 
completing  his  course  in  the  high  school  of  that  city.  For  many  years 
after  engaging  in  his  business  career  he  was  identified  with  the  drug 
trade  in  Newark  and  Jersey  city,  later  entering  the  employ  of  Thomas 
Edison,  the  noted  inventor,  serving  as  clerk  in  his  office  for  a  period  of 
six  years,  at  Menlo  Park,  after  which  he  was  elected  to  the  office  of 


i82  MIDDLESEX 

sheriff  for  Middlesex  county,  in  which  capacity  he  served  for  three 
years,  and  the  following  four  and  a  half  years  he  filled  the  office  of 
under  sheriff.  Subsequently  he  was  a  member  of  the  County  Tax  Board 
for  three  years.  The  duties  pertaining  to  these  various  positions  he 
performed  in  a  capable  manner,  winning  the  commendation  of  all  con- 
cerned. 

Mr.  Carman  is  a  Presbyterian  in  religion,  and  interested  in  the  work

HAROLD  E.  PICKERSGILL,  printer,  publisher  and  public  official, 
of  Perth  Amboy,  is  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  born  in  Gilberton,  Schuyl- 
kill county,  August  8,  1872,  son  of  the  Reverend  Eli  and  Phoebe  (Mc- 
Cracken)  Pickersgill,  both  of  whom  are  yet  living,  at  Port  Carbon, 
Schuylkill  county,  Pennsylvania.  The  father  is  a  native  of  England, 
a;id  the  mother  of  Mount  Bethel,  Northampton  county,  Pennsylvania. 
The  Rev.  Eli  Pickersgill  is  a  minister  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church, 
and  his  ministerial  life  has  been  passed  in  Eastern  Pennsylvania,  cov- 
ering the  long  period  of  fifty-eight  years.  He  has  but  recently  retired 
from  pastoral  work,  but  on  occasion  continues  to  preach  in  neighborhood 
churches. 

Harold  E.  Pickersgill,  after  passing  through  graded  and  high  public 
schools,  entered  the  employ  of  the  Lehigh  Valley  and  Philadelphia  &amp; 
Reading  railroads,  in  a  clerical  capacity.  While  so  occupied,  and  pre- 
vious to  that  time,  he  gave  his  night  hours  to  work  in  a  printing  office, 
taking  on  all  the  duties  of  compositor  and  pressman,  and  also  performing 
reportorial  work,  acquiring  an  experience  which  was  soon  to  bring  him 
into  an  independent  active  career.  At  the  age  of  nineteen  he  had  become 
a  well  equipped  general  printer,  and  he  relinquished  his  railroad  position 
and  took  employment  in  the  printing  office  of  Wilbur  La  Roe,  in  Perth 
Amboy.  After  a  year  he  purchased  his  employer's  interest  in  his  weekly 
paper,  the  "Perth  Amboy  Chronicle,"  which  he  conducted  for  a  year, 
then  reselling  to  Mr.  La  Roe,  and  reentering  his  employ,  an  association 
which  was  maintained  for  several  years.  In  1910  Mr.  Pickersgill  estab- 
lished a  printing  business  of  his  own,  in  which  he  still  continues. 

In  connection  with  his  printing  business  he  issues  a  unique  weekly 
newspaper,  "The  Jersey  Mosquito,"  which  enjoys  much  more  than  a 
local  fame.    Associated  with  him  in  this  business  is  an  only  son,  Richard 


BIOGRAPHICAL  183 

H.  Pickersgill.  Mr.  Pickersgill  is  recognized  as  an  unusually  faithful 
authority  not  only  on  local  history,  but  on  that  of  the  State;  in  the 
former  respect,  the  publishers  of  this  "History  of  Middlesex  County" 
gratefully  acknowledge  his  valuable  aid.  He  has  a  penchant  for  ancient 
works  of  historical  and  literary  worth,  and  upon  his  shelves  are  many 
rare  volumes  acquired  in  the  closing  up  of  old  family  estates,  and  from 
metropolitan  book  sales.  In  these  lines  he  is  well  known  throughout 
the  State. 

Mr.  Pickersgill  has  rendered  efficient  public  service  as  recorder  of 
Perth  Amboy,  in  which  position  he  is  now  serving  his  ninth  term,  and 
his  sixth  term  as  justice  of  the  peace.  In  politics  he  is  a  Republican,  and 
he  is  an  active  member  of  various  clubs  and  lodges  in  which  he  has  held 
official  position. 

Mr.  Pickersgill  married,  in  Perth  Amboy,  in  1894,  Margaret  J.  Bolmer, 
daughter  of  William  S.  and  Josephine  (Bloodgood)  Bolmer,  of  Rahway, 
New  Jersey. 


CHARLES  KUNTZ.— About  the  year  1890,  Isaac  and  Edith  Kuntz 
came  from  their  home  in  Russia  to  the  United  States,  locating  in  New 
York  City.  They  were  the  parents  of  three  sons:  Abraham  M.,  a  busi- 
ness man  of  New  York  City;  Charles,  of  further  mention;  and  Henry, 
a  lawyer  and  member  of  the  New  York  bar. 

Charles  Kuntz,  seeking  a  residence  in  harmony  with  his  scientific 
pursuits,  chose  Iselin,  in  Middlesex  county,  New  Jersey,  and  there 
acquired  a  country  residence  and  land  suitable  for  farm  and  experimental 
purposes.  There  he  has  made  his  home,  amid  pleasant  surroundings, 
his  brother  Henry  also  residing  there.  His  time  is  given  to  scientific 
study  and  research  and  to  the  management  of  the  farm.  There  is  a 
practical  side  to  his  scientific  study;  indeed,  the  results  he  has  attained 
in  poultry  raising  and  egg  production  have  thoroughly  established  the 
fact  that  science  and  the  farm  are  intimately  related  and  should  be  the 
closest  allies.  But  Mr.  Kuntz  is  essentially  the  student,  and  should  be 
regarded  as  an  educator,  for  his  studies  in  sociology  and  philosophy 
are  of  a  serious  nature.  Notwithstanding  his  reserved  and  retiring 
nature,  he  is  well  known  and  highly  regarded. 

Near  Kiev,  a  fortified  city  of  European  Russia,  the  capital  of  the  gov- 
ernment of  Kiev,  on  the  Dnieper  river,  a  city  of  venerable  churches  and 
monasteries  called  the  "mother  of  Russian  cities,"  Charles  Kuntz  was 
born,  January  16,  1870.  He  attended  gymnasium  and  university  at  Kiev, 
his  term  at  the  university  covering  a  year's  study.  After  Kiev,  he  entered 
upon  a  course  of  philosophical  study  at  the  University  of  Vienna,  which 
covered  a  period  of  three  years.  In  1892  he  entered  the  University  of 
Switzerland  at  Zurich  for  courses  in  chemistry  and  science,  and  in  1894 
came  to  the  United  States  and  here  chose  Columbia  University  in  which 
to  pursue  study  in  political  science,  philosophy  and  sociology.  In  1899 
he  devoted  much  time  to  the  study  of  anthropology  at  the  British 
Museum  in  London,  returning  to  the  United  States  in   1901,  locating 


i84  MIDDLESEX 

again  in  New  York  City.  Since  1904  his  home  has  been  at  his  farm 
in  Iselin,  where  he  combines  his  study  with  practical  experiment,  his 
poultry  farm,  devoted  to  pure-bred  white  leghorns,  being  known  among 
poultry  fanciers.  The  farm  is  the  joint  property  and  home  of  Charles 
and  Henry  Kuntz. 

CHARLES  A.  CAMPBELL. — ^This  name  has  long  been  a  prominent 
and  honored  one  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  and  its  perpetuation  is 
provided  for  in  a  third  Charles  A.  Cainpbell,  son  of  Charles  A.  (2),  and 
grandson  of  Charles  A.  (i)  Campbell,  all  born  in  Woodbridge.  Charles 
A.  (i)  Campbell  was  a  very  successful  business  man,  public-spirited, 
progressive  and  useful.  He  was  succeeded  by  his  son,  Charles  A.  (2) 
Campbell,  also  a  business  man  of  prominence  in  both  New  York  and 
Woodbridge,  whose  public  spirit  and  progressiveness  rivals  that  of  his 
father.  Charles  A.  (3),  one  of  the  town's  younger  set,  proved  his  mettle 
by  military  service  with  the  American  Expeditionary  Force  in  France, 
ranking  as  captain  of  infantry. 

Charles  A.  (i)  Campbell,  son  of  John  H.  Campbell,  was  born  in 
Woodbridge  township,  Middlesex  county.  New  Jersey,  June  2,  1836, 
died  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  July  2,  1881.  He  was  educated  in 
the  public  schools,  and  through  wide  courses  of  reading  attained  a 
remarkable  degree  of  learning.  John  H.  Campbell,  his  father,  was  a 
farmer  of  Woodbridge  township,  and  at  the  age  of  fourteen  the  boy, 
Charles  A.,  began  working  on  his  father's  farm  and  continued  his 
assistant  in  farm  work  until  eighteen  years  of  age.  He  then  spent  ten 
years  in  business  in  Metuchen,  New  Jersey,  then,  in  1864,  he  engaged 
in  the  clay  business  in  Woodbridge,  but  a  year  later  sold  out  to  engage 
in  other  matters.  In  1867  he  returned  to  the  business  of  clay  mining 
and  other  activities  under  the  firm  name  of  C.  A.  Campbell  &amp;  Company, 
and  also  was  interested  financially  in  the  Staten  Island  Kaolin  Company, 
an  extensive  clay  mining  and  manufacturing  company.  Mr.  Campbell 
became  one  of  the  prominent  successful  business  men  of  his  town,  having 
many  and  varied  interests.  He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Middlesex 
County  Bank  of  Perth  Amboy  and  a  member  of  its  first  board  of  direc- 
tors, and  a  director  of  the  Amboy  Savings  Institution.  Men  recognized 
his  strong  business  ability,  and  his  opinions  were  deferred  to. 

A  Democrat  in  politics,  he  held  many  positions  of  public  trust.  He 
was  a  judge  of  elections,  member  of  the  township  committee,  a  free- 
holder, commissioner  of  appeals,  school  trustee,  and  in  1875  he  was 
elected  by  his  party  to  represent  his  district  in  the  New  Jersey  Assem- 
bly. He  served  with  honor  in  that  body,  then  returned  again  to  private 
life  and  was  ever  one  of  the  most  eminent  and  representative  citizens  of 
Woodbridge.  At  one  time  he  was  president  of  the  Masonic  Hall  Asso- 
ciation of  Woodbridge,  president  of  the  board  of  trustees  of  the  Congre- 
gational church,  and  during  his  residence  in  Woodbridge  built  many 
fine  residences  and  other  structures  within  town  limits. 

Charles  A.   Campbell  married,  in  Woodbridge,  in   1855,   Susan   L.

Campbell  were  the  parents  of  three  children:  Lizzie,  who  died  young; 
Susan,  now  residing  at  the  old  family  home,  unmarried ;  and  Charles  A. 
(2),  of  further  mention. 

Charles  A.  (2)  Campbell  was  born  August  24,  1865,  and  is  now  con- 
nected with  the  Ostermoor  Mattress  Company  of  New  York.  He  is  a 
director  of  the  First  National  Bank  of  Woodbridge;  president  of  the 
Woodbridge  Masonic  Hall  Association;  at  one  time  was  a  member 
of  the  Woodbridge  Board  of  Education;  is  president  of  the  board  of 
trustees  of  the  Woodbridge  Congregational  Church ;  ex-president  of 
the  Woodbridge  Athletic  Association ;  a  Democrat  in  politics  and  a 
former  freeholder,  representing  Woodbridge  township,  and  otherwise 
prominent  in  local  afifairs.  Mr.  Campbell  married  Bertha  M.  Connors, 
of  Woodbridge,  and  they  are  the  parents  of  two  children:  i.  Charles 
^-  (3)&gt;  who  as  a  captain  in  the  5th  Regiment  of  Infantry,  nth  Division, 
American  Expeditionary  Force,  served  in  France  during  the  World 
War,  1917-1918;  he  married  Marion  Segoine,  of  Point  Pleasant,  New 
Jersey.  2.  Mary  M.,  married  Francis  A.  Chidsey,  of  Easton,  Pennsyl- 
vania, a  graduate  of  Lafayette  College.  Mr.  Chidsey  also  served  with 
the  American  Expeditionary  Force  in  France,  holding  a  lieutenant's 
commission.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Chidsey  are  the  parents  of  a  son,  Francis 
A.  (2). 


AXEL  SOPHUS  OLSEN.— There  is  something  in  the  spirit  of  the 
American  Government  and  of  the  American  Nation  which  wins  the 
loyal  support  of  all  its  adopted  sons.  Its  freedom  from  monarchical 
rule,  its  advantages  for  progress  and  improvement,  unhampered  by 
caste,  seems  to  call  forth  the  best  efforts  of  those  who  come  here  to 
seek  homes,  and  many  rise  to  positions  of  importance  in  the  business 
world  and  other  fields  of  industry.  This  has  been  eminently  the  case 
with  Axel  Sophus  Olsen,  office  manager  and  purchasing  agent  of  the 
Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company. 

Thomas  Ferdinand  Olsen,  father  of  Axel  Sophus  Olsen,  was  born  in 
Denmark,  December  27,  1838,  and  died  in  England  in  1892.  He  had 
been  a  sailor  from  boyhood,  and  during  the  latter  years  of  his  life  was 
a  captain  of  an  English  steamer.  He  married  Anna  Maria  Fallam,  a 
native  of  Throndhjem,  Norway,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  an  only 
child.  Axel  Sophus  Olsen.  Mrs.  Olsen  died  in  England  when  the  boy 
Axel  S.  was  very  young. 

Axel  Sophus  Olsen,  son  of  Thomas  Ferdinand  and  Anna  Maria 
(Fallam)  Olsen,  was  born  in  Thorndhjem,  Norway,  June  30,  1871.  He 
was  educated  in  the  schools  of  Denmark,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty-two 
came  to  the  United  States  and  immediately  settled  in  Perth  Amboy, 
New  Jersey,  where  he  soon  found  employment  as  a  clerk  in  a  general 
store.  On  January  24,  1899,  he  first  associated  himself  with  the  Perth 
Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company,  securing  the  position  of  timekeeper.  It  was 
through  a  quick  ability  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  that  Mr. 


i86  MIDDLESEX 

Olsen  made  himself  of  great  value  to  his  employers  and  rapidly  made 
his  way  up  through  the  positions  of  chief  clerk,  purchasing  agent,  and 
office  manager  to  the  place  of  prominence  which  he  holds  at  the  present 
time,  that  of  office  manager  and  purchasing  agent  of  the  Perth  Amboy 
Dry  Dock  Company.  His  success  has  been  due  to  his  tireless  energy 
and  industry,  together  with  the  training  which  qualified  him  for  fulfilling 
the  duties  of  his  present  office.  Politically  Mr.  Olsen  is  an  Independent, 
voting  for  the  candidate  he  believes  best  fitted  for  the  office  regardless 
of  party  label.  He  affiliates  with  the  Lutheran  church  in  Perth  Amboy, 
and  his  club  is  the  Raritan  Yacht.  His  best  efforts  are  always  given  to 
the  advancement  of  whatever  in  his  judgment  tends  to  the  furtherance 
of  the  welfare  of  the  city.  He  is  treasurer  of  the  Danish  Children's 
Home,  and  has  been  on  its  board  of  managers  since  1912. 

Mr.  Olsen  married,  September  20,  1899,  Ellen  la  Cour,  a  native  of 
Denmark,  but  of  French  descent,  a  daughter  of  Niels  and  Anina  (Jacob- 
sen)  la  Cour,  both  of  Denmark.  Mrs.  Olsen  came  to  the  United  States 
with  her  father  and  mother  in  1892,  they  locating  at  once  in  Perth 
Amboy,  where  with  the  exception  of  five  years  spent  in  Brooklyn  they 
have  always  resided.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Olsen  are  the  parents  of  three  chil- 
dren :  Olaf  la  Cour,  born  June  26,  1900,  now  attending  Syracuse  Univer- 
sity, a  member  of  the  class  of  1923 ;  Norman  la  Cour,  born  October  20, 
1903,  also  a  student  in  Syracuse  University,  class  of  1924;  Gertrude 
Anina  la  Cour,  born  December  12,  1910.  During  the  few  hours  that  Mr. 
Olsen  can  spare  from  his  ever  increasing  business  duties  he  takes  great 
delight  in  long  walks  and  in  boating. 


DAVID  CAMPBELL  PREACHER,  now  master  mechanic  and  chief 
engineer  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company,  was  born  at  Colmo- 
nell,  Scotland,  June  7, 1870,  son  of  David  Campbell  and  Elizabeth  (Craig) 
Preacher,  his  father  a  forester.  He  secured  a  good  public  school  educa-

16,  1889.  Twelve  days  later,  he  arrived  in  New  York,  going  thence  to 
Perth  Amboy,  where  he  engaged  as  a  machinist  with  the  firm  of  Schann 
&amp;  Eckert.  In  January,  1899,  he  was  appointed  superintendent  of  the 
Lea  Machine  Works,  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  and  in  1901 
accepted  the  position  of  superintending  engineer  with  the  Blue  Moun- 
tain &amp;  Raquette  Lake  Steamboat  Company,  of  Raquette  Lake,  New 
York.  In  1905  he  came  to  his  present  position  with  the  Perth  Amboy 
Dry  Dock  Company,  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey. 

Mr.  Preacher  became  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  at  New  Bruns- 
wick, New  Jersey,  August  16,  1898.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Universal

At  Perth  Amboy,  December  31,  1896,  Mr.  Preacher  married  Janet 
Yule  Donaldson  Grieve,  daughter  of  John  and  Agnes  Grieve.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Preacher  are  the  parents  of  four  sons:  i.  David  Campbell,  born  at 
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  November  12,  1899;  he  served  during  the 
World  War  as  a  second-class  machinist  on  the  battleship  "Montana."

WILLIAM  HENRY  BLACK.— The  charm  of  the  sea  reaches  into 
every  little  inlet  that  feels  the  sweep  of  the  tide,  and  throws  a  spell  of 
interest  over  the  life  history  of  every  one  whose  work  is  connected  with 
it.  William  Henry  Black,  superintendent  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry 
Dock  Company,  spent  the  greater  part  of  his  life  in  the  ship  building 
centers  of  the  Maine  coast,  actively  engaged  in  the  construction  of 
sailing  vessels. 

Thomas  Black,  father  of  William  H.  Black,  was  born  in  the  North 
of  Ireland,  and  came  to  Phippsburg  Center,  Maine,  ninety  years  ago.  He 
was  a  farmer,  an  upright,  hard  working  man.  He  died  in  the  same 
seaside  village,  in  1884,  at  the  age  of  eighty  years  and  six  months.  He 
married  Sarah  Black,  who  was  also  born  in  Ireland,  and  she  died  in 
1892,  three  months  past  the  eighty-year  mark.  They  had  a  good  old- 
fashioned  family  of  ten  children,  of  whom  two  are  still  living :  Mrs.  Mary 
Bowker,  of  Bath,  Maine;  and  William  Henry,  who  was  the  youngest 
of  the  family. 

William  Henry  Black  was  born  in  Phippsburg  Center,  Maine,  March 
31,  1858.  He  attended  the  public  school  of  the  village,  and  until  twenty 
years  of  age  helped  his  father  on  the  farm.  But  the  ship  building  opera- 
tions constantly  going  on  in  the  village  were  a  source  of  great  interest 
to  the  young  man,  and  when  twenty  years  old  he  left  the  farm  to  learn 
the  ship  carpenter's  trade.  He  remained  at  Phippsburg  Center  following 
this  trade  for  ten  years.  When  he  was  thirty  years  old  he  took  his 
savings  and  went  to  Bath,  Maine.  There  he  bought  a  house,  and  entered 
the  employ  of  William  M.  Rogers,  as  master  shipbuilder,  later  on  going 
to  the  firm  of  Arthur  Sewell  &amp;  Company  in  the  same  capacity.  While 
he  was  with  the  latter  firm  he  built  the  ship,  "William  P.  Fry,"  which 
was  torpedoed  by  the  Germans  during  the  World  War.  Also  at  the 
Sewell  yards  he  built  four  steel  vessels.  He  was  later  connected  with 
the  ship  yards  at  Waldoboro,  Maine.  During  his  stay  there  he  built 
four  schooners  known  as  the  "White  Fleet."  Still  later,  in  Brewer, 
Maine,  he  built  two  schooners  for  the  I.  K.  Stedman  Company.    With 


i88  MIDDLESEX 

all  this  valuable  experience  in  ship  construction,  he  was  peculiarly  fitted 
for  the  position  which  he  now  fills  as  superintendent  of  the  Perth  Amboy 
Dry  Dock  Company.  He  came  to  this  city  in  1905,  and  has  been  con- 
tinuously in  the  employ  of  this  concern  ever  since,  holding  the  position 
of  superintendent  since  191 1.  Mr.  Black's  time  is  largely  absorbed  by 
his  work,  but  his  interests  are  broad.  His  personal  tastes  lead  him  out- 
of-doors  for  recreation  and  relaxation,  and  he  takes  great  delight  in 
fine  horses,  having  always  owned  a  fast  horse  in  Maine. 

Mr.  Black  married,  October  8,  1881,  in  Bath,  Maine,  Jennie  P.  Morse, 
daughter  of  Scott  and  Pauline  (Shay)  Morse.  She  was  born  in  Bath, 
and  both  her  parents  died  there.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Black  are  the  parents  of 
two  children,  both  living:  i.  Roberta,  born  February  8,  1886,  the  wife 
of  Fred  Whitney,  of  Perth  Amboy;  she  conducts  a  corset  store,  known 
as  the  Gossard  Corset  Shop,  on  Smith  street.  2.  C.  Howard,  born 
October  17,  1889,  manager  of  the  Woolworth  Five  and  Ten  Cent  Store  in 
Perth  Amboy ;  he  is  single ;  he  served  in  the  United  States  army  for  nine 
months  of  the  recent  World  War.  The  family  have  always  attended  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  church. 


WILLIAM  JOHN  RANKIN.— The  story  of  the  career  of  William 
John  Rankin  is  the  story  of  obstacles  overcome  and  fine  ambitions 
achieved  through  sheer  dint  of  perseverance.  That  he  has  won  his  way 
to  the  front  ranks  of  Perth  Amboy  is  due  to  the  innate  force  of  character 
of  the  man  who  took  the  difficulties  with  a  certain  zest  in  the  effort  and 
that  this  confidence  was  not  misplaced  is  shown  by  the  records  of  things 
done. 

Alexander  M.  Rankin,  father  of  William  John  Rankin,  was  born  in 
Scotland,  and  came  to  Prince  Edward  Island  with  his  parents  when  he 
was  very  young.  He  was  a  ship  Ijuilder  by  trade.  He  died  in  Perth 
Amboy,  in  1904,  at  the  age  of  eighty-four  years.  He  married  Lydia 
Louise  Harding,  a  native  of  Prince  Edward  Island.  Mrs.  Rankin  died 
in  Perth  Amboy,  in  1910,  at  the  age  of  eighty-four  years.  To  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Rankin  were  born  ten  children,  eight  of  whom  are  still  alive :  Eliza- 
beth, Katherine,  James,  Jessie,  Mary,  William  John,  of  this  review; 
Collin,  and  Oilman. 

William  John  Rankin  was  born  in  Alberton,  Prince  Edward  Island, 
November  12,  1862.  He  obtained  his  education  in  the  local  public 
schools.  At  the  age  of  eighteen  he  went  to  Bath,  Maine,  and  from  there 
followed  the  sea  for  seven  years,  filling  practically  every  position  on 
a  sailing  vessel  to  that  of  captain,  in  which  capacity  he  was  serving  at 
the  time  he  took  his  position  of  carpenter  and  rigger  with  the  Perth 
Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company  in  1890.  In  1907  he  established  himself 
in  business,  and  while  thus  engaged  built  two  dry  docks,  but  in  1919 
he  again  returned  to  the  Perth  Amboy  Dry  Dock  Company  in  the 
position  of  superintendent,  which  office  he  holds  at  the  present  time, 
1921. 

In  politics  Mr.  Rankin  is  a  Republican,  and  at  one  time  served  as 


BIOGRAPHICAL  189 

alderman  from  the  old  Third  Ward.  He  is  prominent  in  Masonic  circles, 
and  is  a  member  of  Raritan  Lodge,  No.  60,  Free  and  Accepted  Masons ; 
Perth  Amboy  Chapter,  Royal  Arch  Masons;  Empire  Commandery, 
No.  66,  Knights  Templar;  Jerusalem  Temple,  Ancient  Arabic  Order 
Nobles  of  the  Mystic  Shrine;  and  Louisiana  Consistory,  Ancient  and 
Accepted  Scottish  Rite.  He  is  also  affiliated  with  the  Independent 
Order  of  Odd  Fellows,  and  with  the  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order 
of  Elks. 

On  November  11,  1887,  Mr.  Rankin  was  united  in  marriage  with 
Christian  McKay,  and  they  are  the  parents  of  five  children:  Collin  D., 
born  February  13,  1889;  Ella  and  Joseph,  twins,  both  deceased;  James, 
deceased ;  Martha  L.,  wife  of  Samuel  G.  Fugua. 


CHARLES  H.  HINGHER,  as  secretary-treasurer  of  the  Edward 
Hingher  Company,  Nos.  1 16-122  Neilson  street,  New  Brunswick,  occu- 
pies an  influential  place  in  a  business  founded  by  his  honored  father, 
Edward  Hingher,  in  1872.  Edward  Hingher  was  born  in  Rittenberg, 
Germany,  in  1832,  but  when  young  went  to  France,  where  he  became 
an  expert  cabinetmaker.  In  1854  he  came  to  the  United  States,  worked 
in  New  York,  and  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  and  in  1861,  located  in  New 
Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  where  in  1872  he  became  a  manufacturer  of 
furniture  as  a  member  of  the  firm,  Deisenreider  &amp;  Hingher.  They  started 
business  in  a  small  plant  at  No.  47  Albany  street,  but  two  years  later 
a  fire  swept  away  the  plant;  Mr.  Deisenreider  did  not  continue,  leaving 
Mr.  Hingher  to  resume  or  not  as  he  pleased.  He  decided  to  resume  and 
as  a  beginning  bought  the  lot  on  Neilson  street  and  erected  a  building 
too  large  for  his  then  business,  but  which  later  filled  its  every  story  and 
room.  As  his  sons,  Charles  H.  and  Edward,  came  to  suitable  years,  they 
were  admitted  to  the  business,  eventually  succeeding  their  father,  who 
continued  head  of  the  business  until  the  years  grew  too  heavy  and  he 
retired. 

Charles  H.  Hingher,  son  of  Edward  Hingher,  was  born  in  New 
Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  May  16,  1877,  consequently  he  is  five  years 
younger  than  the  business  with  which  he  has  been  connected  since  1897. 
He  was  educated  in  New  Brunswick  public  schools  and  Wilson's  Busi- 
ness College,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty  became  associated  with  his  father 
in  the  furniture  business  at  the  same  location  which  the  Edward  Hingher 
Company  now  occupies.  The  business  was  incorporated,  April  21,  1916, 
and  is  one  of  the  leading  furniture  houses  of  New  Brunswick,  Charles 
H.  Hingher,  secretary  and  treasurer.  The  company  is  a  prosperous 
one  and  fills  an  important  place  in  New  Brunswick  mercantile  life.  Mr. 
Hingher  is  a  member  of  the  Loyal  Order  of  Moose,  Knights  of  the 
Golden  Eagle,  the  Exempt  Fireman's  Association,  New  Brunswick  Board 
of  Trade,  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  and  the  Livingston 
Avenue  Reformed  Church. 

Mr.  Hingher  married,  in  New  Brunswick,  Edna  C.  Johnson,  and  they 
are  the  parents  of  two  daughters :  Nellie  Alberta  and  Myrtle  Elizabeth.

MILLARD  FILMORE  ROSS,  JR.— The  Ross  name  has  long  been 
a  familiar  one  in  Middlesex  county  and  one  associated  with  the  develop- 
ment of  the  New  Jersey  coast  district  since  the  days  of  Congressman 
Miles  Ross,  a  native  son  of  Middlesex  county. 

Miles  Ross  was  born  in  Raritan  township,  April  30,  1828,  and  became 
the  most  popular  Democrat  in  his  district,  so  popular  that  he  held  all 
worth  while  local  offices,  then  was  sent  to  the  New  Jersey  Legislature, 
and  later  to  the  National  House  of  Representatives.  He  sat  in  the  Forty- 
fourth  Congress,  which  convened  December  6,  1875,  and  was  thrice 
reelected,  serving  in  all  four  times,  covering  a  period  of  eight  years.  He 
did  a  great  deal  of  his  district ;  particularly,  the  shore  and  summer  vis- 
itors to  the  bay  district  may  thank  him  for  the  present  boating,  bathing 
and  fishing  facilities  at  Cheesequake  creek,  improvements  begun  and 
carried  on.  for  years  through  government  appropriations  secured  through 
his  influence.    The  family  came  to  the  United  States  from  Scotland. 

Millard  Filmore  Ross,  son  of  Congressman  Miles  Ross,  was  also  a 
prominent  Democrat  of  New  Brunswick,  his  native  city,  and  was  a  well 
known  wholesale  dealer  in  coal.  He  married  Mary  M.  Dixon,  born  in 
Jersey  City,  New  Jersey,  daughter  of  the  eminent  Jonathan  Dixon,  judge 
of  the  Supreme  Court  of  New  Jersey. 

Millard  Filmore  Ross,  Jr.,  son  of  Millard  Filmore  and  Mary  M. 
(Dixon)  Ross,  was  bom  at  the  family  home.  No.  jy  Livingston  avenue.

Rutgers  Elementary  School,  Rutgers  Preparatory  School,  class  of  1916, 
and  Rutgers  College,  leaving  college  in  1917,  when  he  tried  to  enter 
the  United  States  army  for  service  in  the  war  against  Germany.  He 
was  rejected  for  military  service  and  for  the  succeeding  eleven  weeks 
he  "did  his  bit"  with  other  men  by  driving^  a  farm  tractor.  He  then 
made  another  attempt  to  enlist,  but  was  again  rejected.  He  did  war 
work  as  under-foreman  at  the  Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  plant.  He  joined  the 
New  Brunswick  Cavalry  Home  Guard,  and  after  fourteen  unsuccessful 
attempts  received  appointment  to  a  machine  gun  unit  and  was  ordered 
to  report  at  Officers'  Training  Camp,  Camp  Hancock,  Georgia.  Before 
reaching  Camp  Hancock,  the  signing  of  the  armistice  ended  the  war 
and  his  efforts  were  all  in  vain,  except  to  show  the  depth  of  his  patriot- 
ism and  the  sincerity  of  his  intention.  After  the  war,  Mr.  Ross  was 
employed  for  a  time  as  an  automobile  salesman  in  New  York  City  and 
New  Brunswick,  and  on  August  4,  1919,  incorporated  the  M.  F.  Ross,

GEORGE  A.  CLINTON.— The  Middlesex  Granite  and  Marble 
Works  of  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey,  was  established  more  than  a 
quarter  of  a  century  ago  by  the  present  owner,  George  A.  Clinton,  a 
practical  stone  cutter,  whose  vision  and  ambition  led  him  to  make  the 
venture  which  his  ability  and  energy  has  developed  so  successfully.  He 
is  a  son  of  William  and  Lydia  Clinton,  who  at  the  time  of  the  birth  of 
their  son  were  residing  in  Brooklyn,  New  York.  Later,  Mr.  Clinton 
moved  with  his  family  to  a  farm  at  Franklin  Park,  New  Jersey. 

George  A.  Clinton  was  born  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  October  9,  1858, 
but  soon  afterward  the  family  moved  to  the  farm  at  Franklin  Park, 
where  the  lad  George  spent  the  years  of  his  early  life.  He  attended  the 
public  schools  of  the  district  and  until  reaching  the  age  of  nineteen  was 
his  father's  farm  assistant.  But  the  life  of  a  farm  held  no  appeal  for 
him,  and  opportunity  offering,  he  left  home  and  became  a  stone  cutter's 
apprentice  in  the  city  of  New  Brunswick ;  that  was  in  1877,  ^^'^  ^'^^  forty- 
three  years  he  has  made  that  city  his  home  and  business  headquarters. 
For  sixteen  years  he  followed  his  trade  as  apprentice  and  journeyman, 
becoming  an  expert  marble  and  granite  cutter.  He  had, during  these 
years  accumulated  capital  sufficient  to  warrant  starting  in  business  for 
himself,  and  in  1893  made  the  venture  under  the  firm  name.  The  Middle- 
sex Granite  and  Marble  Works,  located  in  New  Brunswick.  He  has  been 
very  successful,  and  his  monumental  works  are  the  largest  in  the  city. 
Mr.  Clinton  is  still  the  active  head  of  the  business  he  founded  and  is  held 
in  high  regard,  both  as  a  business  man  and  citizen.  He  is  well  known  in 
fraternal  life,  is  an  active  church  worker  and  deeply  interested  in  all 
that  concerns  the  public  good.  He  has  served  as  elder  in  his  church, 
also  as  delegate  to  classes.

ROBERT  ALLEN  LUFBURROW,  one  of  the  active  young  business 
men  of  New  Brunswick,  is  one  of  the  organizers  of  the  Highland  Park 
Building  Company,  at  No.  238  Cleveland  avenue.  Having  been  trained 
for  the  profession  of  a  civil  engineer,  he  is  particularly  adapted  for  the 
work  in  which  he  is  now  engaged. 

Born  in  Atlantic  Highlands,  New  Jersey,  December  3,  1886,  Robert 
Allen  Lufburrow  is  the  son  of  Egbert  Frederick  and  Mary  H.  Lufburrow. 
In  his  boyhood  he  attended  the  public  school  in  Atlantic  Highlands  and 
later  the  high  school,  grtiduating  in  1904.  Entering  Rutgers  College, 
in  the  scientific  course,  the  youth  spent  the  next  four  years  there  and 
graduated  with  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Science  in  1908.  Some  time 
later  he  reentered  college  in  the  engineering  course  and  obtained  the 
degree  of  Civil  Engineer  at  his  graduation  in  the  class  of  1913.  Mr. 
Lufburrow's  first  engagement  in  his  new  profession  was  in  the  office 
of  C.  C.  Vermeule,  a  prominent  engineer  of  New  York  City,  where  he 
held  the  position  of  assistant  engineer ;  he  afterward  became  an  assistant 
in  the  office  of  Clyde  Potts,  also  in  New  York  City,  in  the  work  of 
designing  and  construction  of  water  works,  sewers  and  sewage  disposal 
plants.  At  this  time  the  Highland  Park  Building  Company  was  in 
process  of  organization,  and  Mr.  Lufburrow  came  to  New  Brunswick, 
September  15,  1914,  as  secretary  and  treasurer  of  the  new  concern.  For 
a  year  and  a  half  Mr.  Lufburrow  was  absent  from  his  post,  being 
engaged  in  the  United  States  Army  during  the  late  war,  but  upon  his 
return  to  New  Brunswick  in  January,  1919,  he  was  advanced  to  the 
office  of  vice-president  of  the  company,  that  being  his  position  at  the 
present  time  (1921).  Mr.  Lufburrow  is  also  connected  with  the  Cronk

PETER  MICHAEL  CLAUSEN.— Advancement  in  any  of  the 
learned  professions  is  not  so  much  the  result  of  fortuitous  circumstances 
or  of  influence,  as  it  is  the  result  of  individual  merit,  application  and 
skill.  When  these  are  combined  with  ambition  and  a  fixed  determination 
to  achieve  success,  the  desired  result  is  inevitable.  Peter  Michael  Clau- 
sen, although  young  to  have  achieved  a  reputation  in  this  difficult  pro- 
fession, is  fairly  on  the  way  to  acquiring  fame  among  his  legal  brethren. 

Michael  Clausen,  father  of  Peter  Michael  Clausen,  was  born  in  Den- 
mark in  1847.  He  came  to  the  United  States  in  1881  with  his  wife,  Elsie 
(Lund)  Clausen,  a  native  of  Denmark,  and  they  immediately  located  in 
Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  where  they  have  ever  since  resided.  Mr. 
Clausen  has  retired  from  active  business  life,  having  formerly  been  an 
inspector  for  the  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  and  was  also  a  merchant.  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Clausen  are  the  parents  of  seven  children :  Meta,  wife  of  Soren 
Johnson,  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  the  mother  of  four  children;  Peter,  de- 
ceased ;  Mary,  wife  of  Thorvald  Peterson,  of  California,  and  the  mother 
of  three  children;  Emma  N.,  single,  a  teacher  in  the  public  schools  of 
Perth  Amboy ;  Peter  Michael,  of  further  mention ;  Arthur  A.,  in  business 
in  Perth  Amboy,  is  married  and  has  one  child,  Elsie;  Andrew  A., 
enlisted  in  the  United  States  army  in  the  recent  World  War,  was  over- 
seas with  Division  No.  34,  and  would  have  been  in  active  conflict  within 
three  days'  time,  for  the  order  had  been  given,  but  the  armistice  was 
signed  at  that  time. 

Peter  Michael  Clausen,  son  of  Michael  and  Elsie  (Lund)  Clausen, 
was  born  November  18,  1889,  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey.  After 
graduating  from  the  local  grammar  schools,  he  attended  the  Perth 
Amboy  High  School  for  one  year,  and  then  became  messenger  for  the 
Western  Union  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Company,  serving  in  this 
capacity  for  a  year,  at  the  end  of  which  time  he  entered  the  office  of 
Judge  Hommann,  and  under  the  latter's  preceptorship  studied  law  to 
such  good  purpose  that  in  February,  1919,  he  was  admitted  to  practice 
at  the  bar  of  Middlesex  county  and  immediately  began  the  practice 
of  his  profession  in  the  office  where  he  had  been  so  effectually  trained, 
and  where  he  is  located  at  the  present  time.  It  is  interesting  to  note 
here  that  Mr.  Clausen  is  the  only  man  to  pass  the  Middlesex  county 
bar  without  either  a  high  school  or  a  college  education,  and  holds  a 
Regent's  certificate. 

In  his  political  life  Mr.  Clausen  is  a  Republican  and  he  has  actively 
identified  himself  with  the  local  organization  of  that  party,  being  now 
a  participant  in  city  and  county  politics,  and  it  is  probable  that  we  may 
see  him  serving  his  community  in  many  posts  of  responsibility  and  trust. 
Mr.  Clausen  is  a  member  of  the  Foresters  of  America  and  the  Young 
Men's  Christian  Association,  and  affiliates  with  the  local  Lutheran 
church. 

Mr.  Clausen  married,  June  11,  1914,  Bertha  Bosie,  daughter  of  the 
late  John  and  Barbara  Bosie,  both  of  Perth  Amboy.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Clausen  are  the  parents  of  two  children:  Peter  Michael,  Jr.,  born  May 
30,  1915;  Emma,  born  February  12,  1918.

Aside  from  his  professional  life,  Mr.  Clausen  takes  an  active  interest 
in  outdoor  sports  and  devotes  much  of  his  spare  time  to  recreation  of 
this  sort.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  the  future  of  a  successful  lawyer  who 
is  very  young  in  years,  but  his  ability  and  exceptional  attainments 
seem  to  promise  for  him  a  brilliant  future. 


MRS.  HELEN  (GLIDDEN)  TOMBS,  a  resident  of  Sewaren,  New 
Jersey,  traces  descent  from  the  early  English  family  long  seated  at  town 
of  Glidden,  Hampshire  county,  England,  on  the  coast  of  Devonshire, 
a  family  of  French  and  Norman  descent,  who  came  into  England  with 
the  Norman  Conqueror.  Her  home.  Strathspey  Hall,  .is  the  abode  of 
hospitality  and  culture,  her  friends  being  many.  On  the  maternal  side, 
Mrs.  Tombs  descends  from  the  Fisher  family  of  England. 

Helen  Glidden  was  born  in  New  York  City,  daughter  of  Captain 
Samuel  G.  and  Martha  A.  H.  (Fisher)  Glidden,  both  of  distinguished 
ancestry,  traced  to  the  early  days  in  New  England  and  to  a  remote 
period  in  English  history.  The  Gliddens  came  from  Glidden,  Hampshire 
county,  England,  and  the  early  settlers  are  said  to  be  responsible  for 
the  name  New  Hampshire,  given  to  the  territory  now  embraced  in  the 
State  of  that  name,  and  of  settling  the  part  of  Massachusetts  in  1820, 
called  Maine.  Although  the  name  Glidden  was  among  those  early 
settlers  transported  to  New  England,  it  is  now  numerous  in  New  Hamp- 
shire, Maine  and  Ohio.  These  first  Gliddens'  came  from  the  estate  of 
Glidden,  which  comprises  three  thousand  acres,  the  family  descending 
from  Osbert  de  Gladisfen,  Guruvn,  etc.,  and  first  came  into  England  in 
1066,  with  William  the  Conqueror.  Glidden  town  is  situated  about  seven 
miles  south  of  Petersfield,  and  about  twelve  miles  north  of  Portsmouth, 
England.  Shipbuilding  has  been  a  favored  business  in  the  family,  and 
many  Gliddens  have  been  mariners.  Samuel  G.  Glidden  was  of  that 
class,  he  being  a  master  mariner.  When  he  retired  from  the  sea  he 
opened  an  office  in  lower  New  York  and  became  a  very  successful  com- 
mission shipping  merchant,  and  was  a  man  of  importance  in  his  business 
until  his  death,  in  Brooklyn,  at  the  age  of  fifty-three  years.  He  was  a 
man  of  culture,  a  college  graduate,  and  possessed  an  unusually  fine 
memory.  He  was  a  member  of  the  New  York  City  Chamber  of  Com- 
merce, and  bore  a  part  in  city  affairs.  In  appearance  he  was  dignified 
and  commanding,  and  in  manner  most  genial  and  attractive.  His  wife, 
Martha  A.  H.  Fisher,  was  the  daughter  of  Julius  and  Mary  Wheeler 
(Horton)  Fisher,  a  descendant  of  Sir  Daniel  Fisher. 

Captain  Samuel  G.  Glidden  was  a  son  of  Col.  John  Glidden  of  New 
Castle,  Maine,  a  soldier  of  the  War  of  1812,  who  was  in  command  of 
the  old  fort  at  Pemaquid,  Maine,  a  village  near  the  sea,  about  eighteen 
miles  from  the  coast.  The  Gliddens  were  patriots  of  the  Revolution 
and  served  in  the  earlier  Colonial  wars  with  the  French  and  Indians. 

Mrs.  Helen  (Glidden)  Tombs  was  educated  in  Brooklyn,  New  York, 
and  there  resided  until  a  few  years  ago.  Her  husband,  William  Henry 
Tombs  (now  deceased),  was  born  at  Rahway,  New  Jersey,  son  of 
William  H.  and  Margaret  (Ayres)  Tombs;  on  the  maternal  side,  the 


BIOGRAPHICAL  I95 

family  is  related  to  the  Coreys  and  Halseys  of  Newark,  and  to  the 
Davis's  of  Elizabeth,  New  Jersey.  Mr.  Tombs  was  an  inventor  and 
devoted  his  life  to  mechanics.  Mrs.  Helen  (Glidden)  Tombs  resides  at 
Strathspey  Hall,  now  on  the  Cliff  road,  Sewaren,  New  Jersey,  and  she 
is  one  of  the  social  leaders  of  her  community.  She  organized  the  History 
Club  of  Sewaren,  also  the  Civic  Club,  two  organizations  that  have  been 
of  great  value  to  the  town.  It  was  through  the  efforts  put  forth  by  Mrs. 
Tombs  that  a  stone  was  placed  at  Valley  Forge  in  "The  Belfry  tower" 
of  the  Memorial  Cathedral  there,  to  George  Washington's  memory — in 
the  name  of  the  History  Club  of  Sewaren.  She  was  an  active  Red  Cross 
worker  during  the  war  period  and  is  a  generous  supporter  of  all  move- 
ments to  relieve  suffering  or  affliction.  She  is  a  member  of  Fort  Greene 
Chapter,  Daughters  of  the  American  Revolution,  Brooklyn,  and  an 
honorary  member  of  Camp  Middlebrook  Chapter,  Daughters  of  the 
American  Revolution,  of  Bound  Brook,  New  Jersey.  Her  societies  also 
include  membership  in  the  New  England  Woman's  Society,  the  New 
Jersey  Historical  Society,  the  New  York  Historical  Society;  she  is  a

citizens  of  Perth  Amboy  is  Joseph  Frederick  Walker,  principal  of  schools 
No.  I  and  No.  7.  At  the  age  of  eighteen  years  Mr.  Walker  commenced 
teaching  and  has  followed  this  profession  ever  since. 

Tesscier  Walker,  father  of  Joseph  F.  Walker,  was  born  in  Madison 
township,  in  1841,  and  died  there,  in  1874,  at  the  age  of  thirty-three 
years.  He  engaged  in  farming  during  his  lifetime.  He  married  Jane 
A.  Warne,  who  still  resides  in  Perth  Amboy.  To  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Walker 
were  born  four  children:  Ellsworth  B.,  collector  of  revenue  of  Perth 
Amboy,  who  died  December  2,  1920;  Katie,  deceased;  Edwin;  and 
Joseph  Frederick,  mentioned  below. 

Joseph  Frederick  Walker  was  born  in  Cliffwood,  Monmouth  county. 
New  Jersey,  February  5,  1869,  and  was  taken  to  Madison  township  by 
his  parents  when  a  baby.  He  obtained  his  elementary  education  in  the 
local  schools,  and  then  entered  Keyport  Academy,  from  which  he  was 
graduated  in  1887,  and  immediately  commenced  teaching.  His  first 
position  was  in  the  public  schools  of  Morristown,  New  Jersey,  after 
which  he  went  to  Freneau,  New  Jersey,  where  he  taught  school  for 
four  years,  and  subsequently  was  made  assistant  principal  of  the  Mata- 
wan  school,  which  he  graded  and  reorganized.  Desiring  to  acquaint 
himself  more  thoroughly  with  certain  subjects  he  entered  the  State 
Normal  School,  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  and  graduated  from  that  insti- 
tution in  1898.  This  same  year  he  was  elected  to  the  position  of  science 
teacher  in  the  Perth  Amboy  High  School,  and  after  three  years  was 
made  principal  of  schools  No.  i  and  No.  7,  at  Perth  Amboy.  He  is

Baptist  Church  of  Perth  Amboy,  and  has  held  the  offices  of  trustee  and 
treasurer  for  many  years. 

Mr.  Walker's  main  work  in  the  Civic  League  has  been  the  enforce- 
ment of  the  Sunday  laws,  resulting  in  the  closing  of  the  Sunday  movies 
and  keeping  them  closed  in  spite  of  official  opposition.  He  represented 
Middlesex  county  in  the  teachers'  campaign  which  resulted  in  substan- 
tial increases  in  the  salaries  of  every. teacher  in  the  State,  over  $6,000,000 
being  added  in  one  year.  In  his  work  on  the  legislative  committee  he 
helped  to  repeal  the  unsound  teachers'  pension  law  and  helped  frame 
and  secure  the  passage  of  the  new  teachers'  pension  and  annuity  fund, 
which  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  soundest  and  best  pension  laws  in  the 
country. 

On  March  31,  1902,  Mr.  Walker  was  united  in  marriage  with  Mary 
Hart  Hall,  of  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey.  Mrs.  Walker  was  the  first

born  December  7,  1903. 


HERBERT  WILLIAM  NAFEY,  M.  D.— Since  1650  the  name  of 
Nafey  has  been  identified  with  the  life  of  what  was  formerly  New 
Amsterdam,  now  Greater  New  York,  and  also  with  New  Jersey.  De- 
scendants of  the  founder,  Johanus  Nevius,  or  rather  this  branch  with 
which  we  are  especially  interested,  changed  the  name  to  Nafey,  and 
Garrett  Nafey,  a  direct  descendant  and  a  veteran  of  the  Revolutionary

meantime  to  adopt  the  medical  profession,  he  accordingly  matriculated 
in  the  medical  department  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  and  in 
1914  received  from  this  institution  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine, 
serving  his  interneship  the  following  year  at  the  Presbyterian  Hospital, 
after  which  he  immediately  returned  to  New  Brunswick  and  established 
himself  in  the  practice  of  his  profession.  He  is  now,  1921,  acting  assist- 
ant surgeon  of  the  United  States  Public  Health  Service  for  the  New 
Brunswick  area,  and  is  held  in  the  highest  professional  esteem.

ISAAC  NEWTON  BLUE,  JR.— Carrying  the  New  Brunswick 
"Times"  at  the  age  of  eight  years,  a  "printer's  devil"  in  the  offices  of 
the  same  paper  at  thirteen  years,  Isaac  N.  Blue  may  be  described  as 
having  "grown  up  in  the  business,"  a  literal  fact,  and  there  is  perhaps 
no  name  so  well  known  in  New  Brunswick  as  "Blue,  the  printer"  now 
of  the  Morrison  &amp;  Blue  Printing  Company,  Incorporated.  Blue  is  a 
Middlesex  county  family,  long  seated  in  New  Brunswick,  where  Isaac 
Newton  Blue,  Sr.,  was  born  August  21,  1842,  and  yet  resides  there,  in 
his  seventy-ninth  year.  He  is  a  carpenter  by  trade,  though  long  retired, 
but  for  many  years  was  connected  with  the  building  operations  of  his 
city.  For  twenty-three  years  he  was  a  member  of  the  New  Jersey  State 
Militia  and  has  the  medal  awarded  by  the  State  for  service  rendered. 
He  married  Ellen  Ryan,  born  in  New  Brunswick,  July  4,  1843,  now  living 
in  New  Brunswick  in  her  seventy-eighth  year.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Blue  were

Isaac  Newton  Blue,  Jr.,  was  born  in  New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey, 
February  i,  1870,  and  attended  the  public  schools  until  thirteen  years 
of  age.  At  the  age  of  eight  years  he  became  a  newspaper  carrier,  em- 
ployed by  A.  E.  Gordon,  then  owner  of  the  New  Brunswick  "Times," 
and  from  that  time  forward  the  lad  earned  his  own  living.  At  the  age 
of  thirteen  he  left  school  and  became  a  "printer's  devil"  in  the  "Times" 
office,  then  on  Commerce  square.  He  continued  in  the  printing  trade 
with  the  "Times"  and  other  concerns  until  1888,  when  he  opened  a 
printing  office  of  his  own,  doing  business  as  "Blue,  the  Printer."  His 
first  office  was  on  Commerce  square,  next  on  Dennis  street,  where  he 
remained  until  1905,  when  the  Morrison  &amp;  Blue  Printing  Company  was 


198  MIDDLESEX 

incorporated  and  their  plant  located  at  Nos.  7-13  Bethany  street.  The 
company  is  a  well  known  one,  printing  of  every  description  being  turned 
out  by  the  plant  in  as  large  or  as  small  quantities  as  desired.  In  August, 
1920,  Mr.  Blue  purchased  the  interest  of  Mr.  Morrison,  and  is  continuing 
the  business  alone. 

From  1904  until  1908,  Mr.  Blue  was  alderman  from  the  Fifth  Ward

JOHN  L.  SUYDAM,  M.  D.— To  John  L.  Suydam  belongs  the 
unusual  record  of  having  ministered  to  the  physical  welfare  of  the  resi- 
dents of  Jamesburg  and  vicinity  for  thirty-eight  years.  He  has  attended 
three  generations  in  some  families,  ushering  them  into  the  world  and

farm  of  his  parents,  Abram  and  Letticia  Suydam,  October  13,  1859.  He

attend  the  town  school  where  his  early  education  was  acquired.  After 
finishing  the  course  of  this  local  institution  he  entered  Rutgers  Pre- 
paratory School,  from  which  he  graduated,  then  became  a  student  at

politics  of  Jamesburg,  being  one  of  the  standard  bearers  of  the  Repub- 
lican party.  He  has  held  several  public  offices,  serving  on  the  Middlesex

JOHN  JOSEPH  BUCKLEY,  Ph.  G.— Pharmacy  has  been  Mr.  Buck- 
ley's life  work,  the  ambition  of  his  boyhood  being  realized  in  1910,  when 
he  became  proprietor  of  his  own  drug  store,  although  as  a  partner  only, 
the  full  realization  of  his  hopes  and  plans  not  coming  until  five  years 
later,  when  he  moved  to  his  present  location,  No.  219  New  Brunswick 
avenue,  Perth  Amboy,  and  began  business  under  his  own  name.  He 
has  won  high  standing  in  his  profession,  and  as  a  business  man  his 
success  is  most  marked.  Hardly  more  than  over  the  threshold  of  life, 
he  has  fully  proved  his  quality  and  the  future  holds  for  him  bright 
promise.  He  is  a  native  son  of  Perth  Amboy,  his  parents  both  born  in 
Ireland,  marrying  in  Orange,  New  Jersey,  and  later  moving  to  Perth 
Amboy. 

Michael  Buckley,  father  of  John  J.  Buckley,  was  born  in  County 
Kilkenny,  Ireland,  but  when  a  boy  came  to  the  United  States,  and  at 
South  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  found  a  home  and  employment.  He  was  a 
coal  trimmer  at  Amboy,  and  there  died  in  1899,  aged  forty-eight  years. 
He  married,  in  Orange,  New  Jersey,  Bridget  Loretta  Burns,  also  born

John  J.  Buckley  was  born  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  November 
27,  1881,  and  there  completed  courses  of  public  school  study  until 
reaching  high  school.  He  then  left  school  to  become  a  druggist's  appren- 
tice under  the  instruction  of  F.  A.  Seaman,  a  Perth  Amboy  pharmacist. 
Later  he  attended  .the  New  York  College  of  Pharmacy,  whence  in  1903 
he  was  graduated  Ph.  G.  He  continued  in  Mr.  Seaman's  employ  as 
prescription  clerk  until  1910,  when  he  bought  an  interest  in  the  business. 
The  State  street  store  of  Seaman  &amp;  Buckley  was  continued  for  five  years, 
Mr.  Buckley  retiring  in  191 5  to  open  his  present  place  of  business  on 
New  Brunswick  avenue.  The  business  is  conducted  under  the  firm 
name,  J.  J.  Buckley,  and  since  June,  1919,  Mr.  Buckley  has  owned  the 
building  in  which  his  store  is  located.  A  graduate  in  pharmacy,  he  is  a 
thorough  master  of  the  professional  side  of  the  drug  business,  while 
as  a  practical  merchant  his  continued  success  indicates  ability  of  a  high 
order.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Perth  Amboy  Board  of  Health,  and  at 
the  completion  of  his  term,  December  31,  1919,  was  reappointed  for  a

JOHN  JOSEPH  PETERS,  who  for  some  years  has  been  one  of 
the  chief  figures  in  the  industrial  activities  of  the  flourishing  city  of  Perth 
Amboy,  Middlesex  county,  New  Jersey,  and  the  present  head  of  the 
concern  known  as  the  John  J.  Peters  Machine  Works,  Incorporated,  is 
a  native  of  Madison  county,  Ohio,  born  August  17,  1867,  on  his  father's 
farm.  He  is  a  son  of  John  and  Magdalena  (Schmidt)  Peters,  both  of 
Luxemburg,  where  the  former  was  born  in  1836  and  the  latter  in  1833. 
The  elder  Mr.  Peters  came  to  the  United  States  when  twenty-two  years 
of  age  and  located  for  a  time  in  Middletown,  New  York.  Later  he  went 
west  to  Ohio  and  there  became  the  owner  of  a  fine  farm  in  Madison 
county,  which  he  operated  until  about  i88i,  after  which  he  returned  to 
the  East.  For  a  time  he  resided  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  and  from 
there  removed  to  Long  Island  City,  where  his  death  occurred  in  1888, 
at  the  age  of  fifty-two  years.  His  wife  survived  him  and  for  twenty-six 
years  lived  with  her  son,  the  Mr.  Peters  of  this  sketch,  her  death  occur- 
ring in  the  town  of  Fords,  New  Jersey,  March  17,  1917.  They  were 
the  parents  of  nine  children,  as  follows:  Matthias,  who  resides  in 
Brooklyn,  New  York,  and  follows  the  profession  of  engineer;  John  J., 
who  died  in  childhood;  Rosa,  who  died  in  childhood;  Mary,  who  died 
at  the  age  of  twenty-six;  John  Joseph,  whose  career  forms  the  subject 
of  this  sketch ;  Clara,  who  became  the  wife  of  Bertram  Davids,  of  Perth 
Amboy,  New  Jersey;  Eugene,  who  died  at  the  age  of  thirty-two;  Ida, 
who  died  at  the  age  of  sixteen;  and  Emily,  who  died  at  the  age  of 
thirteen. 

The  childhood  of  Mr.  Peters  was  passed  upon  his  father's  farm  in 
Madison  county,  Ohio,  where,  when  he  came  of  an  age  to  make  it 
possible,  he  assisted  the  elder  man  in  the  work  upon  the  place.  He  was 
fourteen  years  old  when  his  parents  removed  to  Brooklyn,  New  York, 
where,  having  received  his  education  at  the  schools  of  his  native  place, 
he  applied  himself  to  the  learning  of  the  trade  of  machinist.  He  fol- 
lowed this  craft  in  Brooklyn  for  about  seven  years',  and  then  went  with 
his  parents  to  Long  Island  City.  There  he  secured  a  position  with  the 
Standard  Oil  Company  in  charge  of  the  concern's  repair  shop,  and 
worked  in  that  capacity  for  seven  years  longer.  The  death  of  his  father 
having  occurred  in  the  meantime,  Mr.  Peters  came  to  New  Jersey  and 
located  in  Perth  Amboy  in  1904,  being  placed  in  charge  of  the  marine 
machine  shop  of  the  Raritan  Dry  Dock  Company.  He  continued  with 
that  concern  for  some  six  years,  and  then  resigned  to  become  master 
mechanic  for  the  Didier  March  Company  of  Keasbey,  New  Jersey. 
Seven  years  were  spent  by  him  in  the  service  of  this  concern,  after 
which  he  resigned  to  take  up  work  of  his  own.  Mr.  Peters  had  always 
been  possessed  of  an  unusual  inventive  faculty,  and  during  the  years  of 
his  employment  by  the  Didier  March  Company  had  elaborated  several 
inventions  of  his  own,  especially  a  post  digging  and  setting  machine  and 
a  clay  digging  machine  which  he  afterwards  patented.  It  was  in  order 
to  further  work  out  these  devices  and  bring  them  to  practical  usefulness 
that  he  left  that  company,  having  laid  by  sufficient  capital  to  enable  him 
to  devote  his  entire  time  to  them.    In  June,  1919,  he  founded  his  present

undertake  jobs  of  especial  difficulty.  The  establishment  is  located  at 
Nos.  51  and  53  Fayette  street,  Perth  Amboy,  and  is  rapidly  growing  to 
be  the  largest  of  its  kind  in  the  neighborhood. 

Mr.  Peters  is  well  known  in  the  general  life  of  the  community,  and 
has  established  a  well  earned  reputation  for  public  spirit  and  intelligence 
in  the  interest  he  takes  in  public  affairs.  He  is  a  Republican  in  politics, 
and  a  member  of  several  fraternal  organizations  and  clubs,  among 
which  should  be  mentioned  Island  City  Lodge,  No.  586,  Ancient  Free 
and  Accepted  Masons,  of  Long  Island  City,  of  which  he  is  past  master ; 
Lodge  No.  784,  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks,  of  Perth 
Amboy,  and  the  Craftsmen  Club.  He  makes  his  home  in  Fords,  New 
Jerey,  within  easy  reach  of  his  place  of  business.

JOHN  H.  LEISEN. — Many  years  ago  the  ancestors  of  John  H. 
Leisen,  of  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  were  living  in  a  small  Rhyeland 
town  along  the  banks  of  the  Rhine  of  Germany,  and  there  a  son,  Frank

local  schools,  and  until  manhood  remained  at  the  home  farm  as  his 
father's  assistant.  He  then  bought  a  farm,  which  he  cultivated  until 
1870,  but  in  that  year  became  interested  in  the  clay  business,  and  for 
thirty  years  conducted  the  business  of  digging  and  shipping  clay  to 
fire  brick  and  terra  cotta  manufacturers.  He  began  in  a  small  way,

in  the  public  schools  of  Woodbridge,  finishing  with  graduation  from 
high  school.  He  became  associated  with  his  father  in  the  clay  business 
in  1885,  and  when  the  Anness  &amp;  Potter  Fire  Brick  Company  was  incor- 
porated in  1900,  he  was  elected  secretary  of  that  company.  During  the 
year  preceding  his  taking  that  position,  he  was  in  business  for  himself,

EDWIN  W.  VALENTINE.— Since  1843  the  name  of  Valentine  has 
been  connected  with  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey,  having  been  introduced 
into  that  town  by  James  Valentine,  who  had  been  a  former  resident 
of  New  York  City,  where  he  was  also  a  merchant.  He  was  born  in 
New  York  City,  August  4,  1792,  and  after  retiring  from  business 
there,  he  bought,  in  1843,  a  large  farm  in  Woodbridge,  and  there  became 
one  of  the  pioneers  of  the  clay  mining  and  clay  manufacturing  business. 
He  was  a  member  of  William  H.  Berry  &amp;  Company,  which  firm  (Wil- 


BIOGRAPHICAL  205 

liam  H.  Berry,  Alexander  Brown,  James  Valentine),  became  the  leaders 
of  the  great  business  which  has  added  so  much  to  the  wealth  and 
importance  of  Middlesex  county.  James  Valentine  became  a  man  of 
wealth  and  landed  interests,  having  a  deep  interest  in  the  general  wel- 
fare of  the  community.  He  was  a  public-spirited  citizen,  and  one  of 
the  builders  of  Woodbridge,  aiding  where  he  did  not  lead  in  all  move- 
ments for  the  advancement  of  town  interests.  He  died  at  a  venerable 
old  age,  about  eighty-eight  years. 

James  Valentine  married  Catherine  Ackerman,  daughter  of  James 
Ackerman,  of  New  York  City,  and  they  were  the  parents  of  eight  sons, 
all  of  whom  were  living  and  in  business  in  Woodbridge  at  the  same 
time :  William ;  Benjamin ;  Robert  N. ;  Mulford  D. ;  James  R. ;  Howard ; 
Edwin  W.,  of  further  mention ;  and  Oscar  G. ;  they  were  also  parents 
of  a  daughter,  Maria  E.,  who  married  Josiah  D.  Drake,  of  Woodbridge. 

Edwin  W.  Valentine,  son  of  James  and  Catherine  (Ackerman)  Val- 
entine, was  born  at  the  Valentine  home  in  Woodbridge,  New  Jersey, 
July  21,  1849,  and  in  that  town  his  life  has  been  largely  passed.  He 
was  educated  in  Woodbridge  schools,  and  to  the  learning  of  school 
days  he  added  the  learning  gained  by  practical  contact  with  the  world 
and  from  books  and  travel.  After  school  years  were  over,  he  became 
associated  with  his  able  father  and  brothers  in  clay  mining  and  manu- 
facturing, the  Valentines  owning  clay  mines  and  kilns  at  Woodbridge

business  all  his  life,  only  retiring  in  1920,  after  about  half  a  century  of 
close  attention  to  its  demands.  He  was  highly  esteemed  by  his  associ- 
ates in  the  business,  and  considered  an  authority  in  all  matters  pertain- 
ing thereto. 

Like  his  father,  Mr.  Valentine  has  taken  a  deep  interest  in  Wood- 
bridge  advancement,  his  public  spirit  having  been  displayed  in  many 
forms.  He  is  a  Republican  in  politics,  a  member  of  the  Independent 
Order  of  Odd  Fellows,  the  Royal  Arcanum,  and  his  religious  connection 
is  with  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church.

Harned,  daughter  of  William  and  Mary  Phillips  Harned,  her  father  a 
business  man  of  New  York,  who  late  in  life  moved  to  Woodbridge,

FLOID  TURNER  HOWELL.— As  president  of  the  Woodbridge 
Lumber  Company,  Mr.  Howell  holds  an  important  place  in  the  business 
life  of  Woodbridge.  He  is  a  son  of  Edward  Albertson  and  Hannah  Jane 
Howell,  his  father  a  merchant  of  Hope,  Warren  county.  New  Jersey.

the  parents  of  two  children :  Harry  Robert  and  Ria.  The  family  home 
is  in  Sewaren,  New  Jersey. 


JENS  M.  SORENSEN.— It  is  most  fitting  that  in  a  work  of  this 
nature  the  names  should  be  perpetuated  of  those  men  who  have  borne 
a  part  in  the  physical  growth  of  the  cities  of  New  Jersey.  Jens  M. 
Sorensen,  of  Perth  Amboy,  has  already  contributed  largely,  through  the 
handling  of  building  materials,  to  the  future  stability  of  the  city  and 
its  surrounding  towns,  and  being  still  a  young  man  can  be  depended 
upon  to  mean  much  more  to  the  future  of  this  section. 

Mr.  Sorensen's  father,  Peter  Tang  Sorensen,  was  born  in  Denmark, 
and  came  to  this  country  in  191 7.  Since  that  time  he  has  retired  from 
active  business  and  resides  with  his  son,  Jens  M.  He  married  Petra 
Peterson,  who  was  also  bom  in  Denmark.  She  died  in  June,  1916, 
at  the  age  of  sixty-two  years.  Peter  Tang  and  Petra  (Peterson)  Soren- 
sen were  the  parents  of  three  sons,  who  are  now  all  residents  of  Perth 


BIOGRAPHICAL  207 

Amboy :  Jens  M.,  of  whom  more  extended  mention  follows ;  Anton,  who 
is  actively  engaged  in  business  as  a  contractor ;  and  Neils  M.,  a  butcher, 
who  has  recently  started  his  store  in  Tottenville. 

Jens  M.  Sorensen  was  born  in  Denmark,  on  his  father's  farm,  April 
27,  1880.  He  gained  his  education  under  difficulties,  for  two  years  being 
obliged  to  walk  four  miles  to  attend  high  school  in  a  nearby  town. 
He  assisted  his  father  on  the  farm,  and  later  learned  his  trade  in  Den- 
mark. He  came  to  America  at  the  age  of  twenty-three  years,  being  the 
first  of  his  family  to  venture  across  the  ocean  in  search  of  success.  He 
located  at  once  in  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  and  during  the  first  four 
years  worked  at  the  painter's  trade.  But  the  young  man  was  not 
satisfied  always  to  work  for  wages.  He  believed  there  was  greater  satis- 
faction, as  well  as  greater  pecuniary  advantage,  in  handling  his  own 
business  affairs.  So  in  1908,  having  saved  up  a  little  capital,  he  estab- 
lished himself  in  business.  He  made  his  start  along  a  line  with  which 
he  was  familiar,  handling  at  first  only  masons'  materials.  Gradually, 
as  opportunity  offered,  and  he  was  able  to  handle  the  expansion,  he 
added  other  linps  of  building  materials,  lumber,  hardware,  paints,  every- 
thing necessary  for  all  kinds  of  building  construction.  His  success  has 
been  remarkable  for  so  young  a  man,  and  the  volume  of  business  he 
handles  places  him  in  the  front  rank  of  the  business  men  of  the  city. 
Mr.  Sorensen  is  a  member  of  the  Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows 
and  of  the  Danish  Brotherhood.  He  is  a  member  and  regular  attendant 
of  the  Danish  Methodist  Episcopal  church,  serving  on  its  board  of 
trustees. 

Mr.  Sorensen  married,  when  on  a  return  pleasure  trip  to  his  native 
land,  January  29,  1908,  Olga  Friis,  daughter  of  Anton  and  Karen  (Peter- 
sen) Friis.  She  was  born  in  Denmark,  and  her  parents  now  live  there 
in  the  famous  old  town  of  Ribe.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Sorensen  are  the  parents

JOSEPH  LOUIS  KLEIN.— Among  the  most  prosperous  citizens 
of  foreign  birth  who  have  made  Perth  Amboy,  New  Jersey,  their  home 
and  the  scene  of  their  careers,  should  be  mentioned  Joseph  Louis  Klein, 
who  was  formerly  the  owner  of  a  large  butcher  and  grocery,  establish- 
ment at  No.  48  Smith  street,  and  now  engaged  in  the  insurance  busi- 
ness here.  Mr.  Klein  was  bom  February  15,  1875,  in  Zahony,  Ung 
county,  Hungary,  a  son  of  Abraham  and  Fannie  (Weis)  Klein,  old 
and  highly  respected  people  there.  Abraham  Klein  was  born  in  the  year 
1850  in  Hungary,  came  to  the  United  States  in  1888,  with  his  wife  and 
family,  settling  in  New  York  City,  where  he  engaged  in  the  shoe  busi- 
ness, meeting  with  considerable  success.  His  death  occurred  in  that 
city,  February  20,  1900,  and  that  of  his  wife  in  Bayonne,  New  Jersey, 
February  16,  1920. 

Joseph  Louis  KUein  received  his  early  education  in  the  schools  of 
his  native  land  and  Germany,  which  he  attended  until  he  had  reached 
the  age  of  thirteen.    He  then  accompanied  his  parents  to  the  United 


2o8  MIDDLESEX 

States  and  here  continued  his  studies  for  a  number  of  years  in  the 
night  schools  of  New  York  City.  He  was  a  bright,  industrious  lad  and 
made  the  most  of  his  educational  opportunities,  so  that  when,  four  years 
later,  at  the  age  of  seventeen,  he  removed  to  Boston,  Massachusetts, 
he  had  completed  his  studies  and  was  ready  to  engage  in  business.  For 
six  years  he  was  associated  with  a  fur  establishment  in  Boston,  where 
he  learned,  not  only  the  details  of  that  trade,  but  general  business  meth- 
ods as  well.  At  the  close  of  that  period,  1901,  he  came  to  New  Jersey, 
settled  in  Perth  Amboy,  and  entered  into  a  partnership,  at  the  request 
of  his  older  brother,  Morris  Klein,  and  the  two  young  men  opened  a 
market,  where  they  sold  meat  and  groceries,  meeting  with  success. 
This  association  was  continued  for  five  years,  and  then  Mr.  Klein  pur- 
chased his  brother's  interest  and  carried  it  on  by  himself  until  1920, 
when  he  engaged  in  the  insurance  business.  He  remained  at  the  original 
location  for  twelve  years  in  all  and  then,  the  trade  growing  too  large 
for  the  comparatively  restricted  quarters,  Mr.  Klein  purchased  the 
building  at  No.  48  Smith  street,  Perth  Amboy,  and  proceeded  to  fit 
it  up  as  an  ideal  butcher  shop  and  market.  He  began  by  completely 
renovating  the  entire  structure  and  then  installed  the  most  modern 
fittings  and  equipment,  including  marble  floors,  tile  counters,  cold 
air  refrigerators  and  everything  to  make  it  a  most  up-to-date  establish- 
ment. His  liberal  policy  has  borne  well  deserved  fruit  and  the  store  is 
today  undoubtedly  one  of  the  finest  of  its  kind  in  the  neighborhood  and 
does  a  large  business.  His  reputation  for  square  and  honest  dealing 
is  an  enviable  one  and  is  thoroughly  well  deserved,  for  both  in  the 
quality  of  his  wares  and  the  service  he  gives  his  many  customers  he 
has  set  the  standard  for  the  community.  Mr.  Klein,  since  November 
15.  1920,  has  been  connected  with  the  Metropolitan  Life  Insurance 
Company  with  local  ofifices  in  Perth  Amboy  at  No.  196  Smith  street, 
where  he  has  been  successful.  Mr.  Klein  has  always  taken  a  public- 
spirited  interest  in  the  general  life  of  the  community  where  he  has 
elected  to  live,  and  is  prominent  in  social  and  fraternal  circles,  being 
a  member  of  many  organizations  of  various  kinds.  He  is  affiliated  with 
Raritan  Lodge,  No.  61,  Ancient  Free  and  Accepted  Masons ;  and  Perth 
Amboy  Lodge,  No.  784,  Benevolent  and  Protective  Order  of  Elks.  He 
is  of  a  strongly  religious  nature  and  gives  liberally  to  many  charitable 
institutions,  including  the  Children's  Home,  at  Denver,  Colorado,  the 
Young  Men's  Hebrew  Association,  and  the  City  Hospital  at  Perth 
Amboy.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Progress  Club  of  Perth  Amboy,  and 
takes  a  keen  and  intelligent  interest  in  all  the  great  problems  and  issues 
of  the  times.  He  is  a  member  of  the  Congregation  of  Beth  Mordecai  of 
Perth  Amboy. 

Joseph  Louis  Klein  was  united  in  marriage,  March  9,  1902,  in  Perth 
Amboy,  with  Esther  Greenbaum,  like  himself  a  native  of  Hungary, 
where  she  was  born  March  9,  1883,  a  daughter  of  Abraham  Isaac  and 
Florence  (Weiss)  Greenbaum.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Klein  are  the  parents  of 
two  children,  as  .follows :  Florence  Gertrude,  born  May  30,  1903 ;  and 
Albert,  born  July  7,  1905.
