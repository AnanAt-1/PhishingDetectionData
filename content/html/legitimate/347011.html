Do his supporters care? Not for a nano-second. The fact that a person in power is stupid, uneducated, unaware and unwilling to think about anything other than saying whatever he thinks it takes to stay in office is nothing new. Plenty of smart politicians have said stupid things to keep their base happy.

So, too, is our Coach."},{"_id":"4KDF65RUEVHLTIEUSVP4MOLTHM","additional_properties":{"_id":1689369856656},"type":"text","content":"Tommy Tuberville is not dangerous because he is unfit by intellect, experience, judgment, character and skill to be a senator.
