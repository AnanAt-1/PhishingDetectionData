<H2>History</H2>
The W-League's inaugural season was in 1995. Originally called the United States Interregional Women's League, it later changed its name to the W-League. Although at its inception some of the league's franchises were barely above amateur level, it provided a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country.  With professionals driving the level of play, the league made a very strong debut performance.<br />
<br />
From 1995 through the 1997 season the W-League was a single tier format (all teams at the same division).  This changed before the 1998 season when the W-League became a two tier league.  The top tier/division was called W-1 and lower division, W-2.  This division was in effect through the 2001 season - the first year of the new US Women's first division league <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("92653",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("92653")' href="/topics/Women's_United_Soccer_Association">WUSA</a><span class="hp" id="m92653"><div class="hpHeader">Women's United Soccer Association</div><div class="hpContent">The Women's United Soccer Association, often abbreviated to the WUSA, was the world's first women's soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals.

The W-League returned to a single tier format in the 2002 season, and remains as such.<br />
