This resource kit includes a paper describing our experiences,specific details on equipment and materials required, as well as samplelaboratory exercises from our first offering of the AI course. More up-to-datematerials can be accessed via the world-wide-web pages listed at the end.For more information, please feel free to contact the authors.<BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=+1><BR><BR>Contents</FONT></B></P><UL>  <LI><A HREF="Paper.html">A Robot Laboratory for Teaching Artificial Intelligence  (SIGCSE 98 Paper)</A><BR CLEAR="ALL">In this paper, we have described a  project that involved the creation of two identical robot building laboratories  at two undergraduate institutions. The laboratory has been used for teaching  the undergraduate AI course. Laboratory materials have been made available  along with detailed information on how to create such a laboratory at other  institutions. The laboratory helps introduce a central theme in the teaching  of AI, and, at the same time, strengthens the role AI plays in the core  computer science curriculum.  <LI><A HREF="Lab.html">Outfitting a Robot laboratory</A><BR CLEAR="ALL">Here,  we present, in complete detail, the laboratory environment, the equipment  required, and ordering information for setting up a robot building laboratory.  <LI><A HREF="Syllabus.html">Sample Syllabus for an AI Course</A><BR CLEAR=  "ALL">A summary of the syllabus of our AI course that is integrated with  the robot building laboratory.  <LI><A HREF="RobotExercise.html">The Robot Exercise</A><BR CLEAR="ALL">A  class exercise involving the emulation of a blocksworld robot by four students.  <LI><A HREF="LabHandout.html">Robot Laboratory Handout</A><BR CLEAR="ALL">Specific  lab exercises from our first offering.  <LI><A HREF="ControlProgram.html">A Sample Control Program</A><BR CLEAR=  "ALL">An Interactive C, robot control program.  <LI><A HREF="Info.html">For More Information</A><BR CLEAR="ALL">Useful  links for further reference.</UL><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P>This resource kit was prepared as a document distributed at ACM SIGCSE1998, Atlanta, GA in the NSF/ILI Project Demonstrations.<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=-2>This work was supported in part by grant DUE-9651472from the National Science Foundation's ILI/IP program, grants from BrynMawr College, Swarthmore College, The Mellon Foundation, and the HowardHughes Medical Institute.</FONT></BODY></HTML>
