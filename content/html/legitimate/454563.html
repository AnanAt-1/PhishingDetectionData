He was the world number one&nbsp;player for both 1926 and 1927.<br />
<br />
In 1933, Lacoste founded <i>La Société Chemise Lacoste</i> with André Gillier. The company produced the tennis shirt which Lacoste often wore when he was playing, which had an alligator (generally thought to be a crocodile) embroidered on the chest.<br />
<br />
In 1963, Lacoste created a sensation in racquet technology by patenting the first tubular steel tennis racquet.  Until then, racquets had almost always been made of wood.  This new racquet's strings were attached to the frame by a series of wires, which wrapped around the racquet head.  The racquet was marketed in Europe under the Lacoste brand, but in the United States it was marketed by Wilson Sporting Goods and achieved critical acclaim and huge popularity as the Wilson T-2000, used by American tennis great <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("9485",this,"jimmy_connors.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("9485")' href="/topics/Jimmy_Connors">Jimmy Connors</a><span class="hp" id="m9485"><div class="hpHeader">Jimmy Connors</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i9485"></div>James Scott "Jimmy" Connors  is an American former world no. 1 tennis player....</div><br></span>.<br />

<br />
There are numerous explanations of why Lacoste was originally nicknamed the Crocodile. A 2006 New York Times&nbsp;obituary about Lacoste's son, Bernard, provides an apparently authoritative one.  In the 1920s, supposedly, Lacoste made a bet with his team captain about whether he would win a certain match.  The stakes were a suitcase he had seen in a Boston store; it was made of crocodile (or alligator) skin.  Later, René Lacoste's friend Robert George embroidered a crocodile onto a blazer that Lacoste wore for his matches.<br />
