<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Self-Esteem and Repartee in <i>GURPS Swashbucklers</i></h2>
<h2>Importing an Idea from <b><i>Lace and Steel</i></b></h2>

&copy;1992, 1994 by Steffan O'Sullivan

<hr>

<b><i>Lace and Steel</i></b> is a roleplaying game designed by Paul Kidd and
published by The Australian Games Group. The setting resembles
Europe in the mid-17th century, with a twist. The game combines
some fantasy elements, such as low-level magic, harpies, centaurs
(half-horses, please!), pixies, etc., with black powder weapons
and swashbuckling heroics. It is a very fun game, with good game
mechanics and an interesting combat resolution system.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part of the game, however, is the social interaction
that takes place. <b><i>Lace and Steel</i></b> is able to satisfy a gamer who
desires to play a noble courtly lady, for example: there is plenty for
such a character to do in this world and game system.</p>

<p>In particular, two aspects of the game are so fitting to a swash-
buckling setting that I've written them up in <b><i>GURPS</i></b> terms. These are
the courtly skill of Repartee and the gaming mechanic of self-esteem.

<h3>Self-Esteem</h3>

High self-esteem is best thought of as a temporary advantage, and low
self-esteem as a temporary disadvantage. Unless something has happened
to affect your self-esteem, consider it always to be 0: neutral.
(While it is possible to create a new advantage, High Self-Esteem, and
a new disadvantage, Low Self-Esteem, this is not advisable as a
permanent state. For one thing, the costs would be very extreme. For
another, it's more fun to have it fluctuate, as you'll see!)</p>

<p>Self-esteem can fluctuate from -3 to +3, but is normally 0. When a
character's self-esteem reaches +3, he feels very good about himself
and is full of cocksure bravura and dash, <i>ala</i> Errol Flynn. When his
self-esteem reaches -3, he feels as if he can't do anything right, and
more closely resembles a Woody Allen character. Anyone who's ever seen
the old Danny Kaye movie, <i>The Court Jester</i>, knows exactly the
difference between high and low self-esteem in the same character, and
the effect it has on skills. (If you don't know this movie, see it
soon.)</p>

<p>A character's self-esteem level affects all of his skill levels. If
you feel good about yourself, you'll do better at whatever you try; if
you feel low, you won't have as good a chance as succeeding. Thus, a
character in a state of +3 self-esteem is at +3 to all skills!</p>

<p>The effect lasts for one hour at each level, gradually returning to
normal, until self-esteem is back to 0. For example, a self-esteem of
-1 lasts for one hour, at which point the character's self-esteem
returns to 0. A character with self-esteem +3 has a +3 to all skills
for one hour, then a +2 for one hour, and finally a +1 for another
hour.  (This time is relative to the character, not the player.  That
is, one hour in the game may last a few minutes to the players, or take
several sessions to game through, depending on the situation.)</p>

<p>Self-esteem can never rise above +3 or below -3. Repeated attempts to
raise self-esteem must wait until the current level changes &ndash; that is,
there must be at least one hour in between attempts to raise self
esteem.</p>

<p>At this point, most gamers want to know how to get high self-esteem and
avoid low self-esteem. There are two ways to change your self-esteem
level: daring deeds and Repartee "combat."

<h3>Daring Deeds</h3>

If a character is trying an especially hazardous or otherwise risky
maneuver, he may opt to invest self-esteem in the venture. The GM is
the final arbiter of how much self-esteem can be invested: anywhere
from 1 to 3. If a character has a particularly good chance of
succeeding at something, there is no risk involved, and no self-esteem
can be invested. An example would be the most skilled darts player
taking on a country bumpkin in a game of darts &ndash; there is no chance of
his self-esteem rising after defeating such a foe. Conversely, if he
were beaten, he would suspect he was either cheated or "set up," and
his self-esteem would not be likely to suffer an undue blow.</p>

<p>But if a fencer is in a "first blood" duel with an unknown (but
dangerous-looking) foe, he may opt to risk some self-esteem. Something
as serious as a duel allows risking 0, 1, 2, or 3 self-esteem levels,
as the player wishes. The more self-esteem risked, the greater the
loss or gain, depending on the outcome of the duel.</p>

<p>As an example, Pierre, a Musketeer, is in a duel with a stranger.
Pierre feels pretty sure he can beat the stranger, so he risks 3 self
esteem. If Pierre wins, all of his skills are at +3 for the next hour,
then at +2 for the following hour, and +1 for the third hour. Should
he lose, however, all of his skills are at -3 for the next hour, and so
on.</p>

<p>Aside from physical danger, other examples of self-esteem risk are
courting someone, rescuing someone close to you, asking for a raise or
to be sent as a trusted emissary on a critical mission, succeeding at
such a mission, throwing a party with the king in attendance, and so
on.

<h3>Repartee (Mental/Average) &ndash; Defaults to IQ-5</h3>

Repartee is the skill of verbal combat. It is full of impaling
witticisms, cutting remarks and crushing retorts. However, Repartee
isn't overtly insulting: the implications are devastating, but there is
never anything solidly libelous that would stand up in court. Unlike
physical combat, it doesn't do physical damage: it does self-esteem
damage.</p>

<p>While Repartee is primarily an upper-class skill, there is a
lower-class version of it, often found in bars and workplaces. The
lower-class battles tend to be cruder and less witty, but not always.
However, there is a natural reticence to enter Repartee with someone of
a higher status, unless open revolt is brewing. In general, the GM
should disallow Repartee between the lower classes and the upper
classes. Should the occasion arise, however, the lower-class combatant
has a penalty to his skill equal to the difference in Status levels.</p>

<p>Repartee combat is begun by one party <i>almost</i> insulting another
person. If the other party chooses to ignore the taunts, a successful
Acting (or Savoir-Faire) roll will extract him or her without any self
esteem risked. A failed roll means you showed your annoyance with the
remark. At this point, you must either begin Repartee combat or your
self-esteem drops to -1 immediately.</p>

<p>If Repartee combat is engaged, each party engaged must announce how
much self-esteem is risked: from 1 to 3. They then roll a Contest of
Skills and keep a running total of the amount won by. When one
contestant reaches a total of 10 more than the other, the Repartee
combat is over, and the loser stomps off in anger amid the laughter of
spectators. The winner's self-esteem is enhanced by the amount he
risked, and the loser's is decreased by the amount he risked. These
may be different amounts.</p>

<p>At any time up until one party has a running total of 5 more than the
other, either participant can break off the Repartee combat, at a cost
of -1 self-esteem. The victor gains +1 self-esteem. At any time up
until one party has a running total of 10 more than the other, either
participant can break off the Repartee combat, at a cost of -2 self
esteem. The victor gains +2 self-esteem.</p>

<p>If a <i>player</i> is making particularly good cutting remarks, the GM
should give a bonus to his character's Repartee skill. In fact, if the
group is naturally witty enough, the GM should not allow the Repartee
skill at all, but require the players to supply their own remarks.</p>

<p>Example: Jean-Paul, a Musketeer, and Sebastian, a Cardinal's guard, are
rivals for Marie's hand. They meet at a fancy ball, with Marie making
eyes at both them of them while the other is watching. Smallsword
combat would be inappropriate at a Duke's ball, so they engage in
Repartee combat.</p>

<p>Jean-Paul struts forward and announces that Sebastian looks very good
tonight &ndash; that yellow scarf is especially appropriate. Sebastian is
quick to respond that Jean-Paul's dress sword looks particularly
polished &ndash; or is that unused. Jean-Paul's Repartee skill is 14, and
Sebastian's is 15. They are both Status 1. The first round of
"combat" goes to Jean-Paul, as he rolls a 9, making his Repartee
skill by 5, and Sebastian only rolls a 12, making his by 3. Jean-Paul
is 2 ahead at this point.</p>

<p>They exchange other remarks, rolling the dice again: Sebastian this
time wins by 6. Subtracting Jean-Paul's earlier success from the
current score, Sebastian is now ahead by 4. On the third roll,
Jean-Paul wins by 1, so Sebastian is ahead by only 3.
<p>And so on &ndash; they keep bantering back and forth until one either wins
decisively or quits the combat.</p>

<p><b><i>Lace and Steel</i></b> contains an excellent example of Repartee combat: two
women making caustic observations about each other's clothing and lack
of style. Other possibilities include insinuating cowardice, lack of
virginity, corruption, low mentality, clumsiness, and baseness of
character in many ways &ndash; see the list of Mental Disadvantages.
