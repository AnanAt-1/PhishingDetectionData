The  copy  filmed  here  has  been  reproduced  thanks 
to  the  generosity  of: 

National  Library  of  Canada 


The  images  appearing  here  are  the  best  quality 
possible  considering  the  condition  and  legibility 
of  the  original  copy  and  in  keeping  with  the 
filming  contract  specifications. 


L'exemplaire  film6  fut  reproduit  grdce  &amp;  la 
g6n6rosit6  de: 

Bibliothdque  nationale  du  Canada 


Les  images  suivantes  ont  6t6  reproduites  avec  le 
plus  grand  soin,  compte  tenu  de  la  condition  et 
de  la  nettetd  de  l'exemplaire  film6,  et  en 
conformity  avec  les  conditions  du  contrat  de 
filmage. 


Original  copies  in  printed  paper  covers  are  filmed 
beginning  with  the  front  cover  and  ending  on 
the  last  page  with  a  printed  or  illustrated  impres- 
sion, or  the  back  cover  when  appropriate.  All 
other  original  copies  are  filmed  beginning  on  the 
first  page  with  a  printed  or  illustrated  impres- 
sion, and  ending  on  the  last  page  with  a  printed 
or  illustrated  impression. 


The  last  recorded  frame  on  each  microfiche 
shall  contain  the  symbol  — ^  (meaning  "CON- 
TINUED "),  or  the  symbol  V  (meaning  "END"), 
whichever  applies. 


Les  exemplaires  originaux  dont  la  couverture  en 
papier  est  imprim6e  sont  film^s  en  commandant

la  dernidre  page  qui  comporte  une  telle 
empreinte. 

Un  des  symboles  suivants  apparaitra  sur  la 
dernidre  image  de  cheque  microfiche,  selon  le

symbole  V  signifie  "FIN". 


Maps,  plates,  charts,  etc.,  may  be  filmed  at 
different  reduction  ratios.  Those  too  large  to  be 
entirely  included  in  one  exposure  are  filmed 
beginning  in  the  upper  left  hand  corner,  left  to 
right  and  top  to  bottom,  as  many  frames  as 
required.  The  following  diagrams  illustrate  the 
method: 


Les  cartes,  planches,  tableaux,  etc.,  peuvent  dtre 
filmds  d  des  taux  de  reduction  diff6rents. 
Lorsque  le  document  est  trop  grand  pour  dtre 
reproduit  en  un  seul  clich6,  il  est  film6  d  partir 
de  Tangle  supdrieur  gauche,  de  gauche  d  droite, 
et  de  haut  en  bas,  en  prenant  le  nombre 
d'images  ndcessaire.  Les  diagrammes  suivants 
illustrent  la  mdthode.

PUBLISHER'S  PREFACE. 


Every  possible  means  has  been  taken  to  insure  a  reliable  Census  ok  Montreal. 
To  those  who  really  desire  the  Census  I  have  to  say  that  they  are  mainly  indebted 
to  Andrew  F.  Gault,  Esq.,  and  to  Hugh  Graham,  Esq.,  for  the  undertaking  and 
completion  of  it.  At  the  request  of  the  former  and  after  consultation  with  the  latter 
of  these  gentlemen,  I  decided  to  undertake  a.  Census  of  Montreal.  I  then  prepared  a 
Prospectus  and  commenced  a  canvass  for  subscriptions ;  but  after  an  urgent  appeal  I 
soon  saw  that  sufficient  subscribers,  at  50c.  each,  could  not  be  secured  to  meet  half 
the  cost  of  publication.  This  being  the  case  I  applied  to  patriotic  citizens  to  aid  me 
by  becoming  50c.  Line  Contributors,  and  thereby  save  me  from  serious  loss,  as 
otherwise  I  should  be  forced  to  abandon  the  work  I  had  so  cheerfully  undertaken, 
and  to  disappoint  my  generous  and  true  friends.  I  am  proud  to  say  that  50c.  Line 
Contributors  enabled  me  to  put  sixty  Sworn  Enumerators  on  the  Strpets,  Squares, 
etc.,  of  the  City,  to  look  for  and  obtain  the  actual  number  sleeping  in  each  house, 
or  other  building,  their  sex,  religion  and  calling ;  and  at  the  request  of  the  Finance 
Committee  of  the  Corporation,  to  take  the  Nationalities,  Forms  for  which  were 
prepared  with  studied  care  and  in  the  belief  that  they  would  be  acceptable.  But,  no  1 
A  few  gentlemen  were  annoyed  because  I  had  no  heading  or  column  for  English 
Canadians  !  Well,  I  fancied  I  had  several  headings  for  English  Canadians ;  that  is,  I 
had  a  heading  for  English,  English  born  in  Canada;  Irish,  Irish  born  in  Canada; 
Scotch,  .Scotch  born  in  Canada,  and  so  on ;  these  headings  enabled  me  to  make  a 
Recapitulation  of  Nationalities,  printed  on  page  21.  It  will,  I  trust,  satisfy  the 
most  fastidious.  The  sixty  sworn  Enumerators  did  not  hear  of  complaints  about 
the  Nationalities.  I  may  add  that  each  Enumerator  spoke  and  understood  French 
and  English.  Their  returns  show  a  population,  within  City  limits,  of  1 10,098  females  ; 
101,204  males;  81,189  Catholic  females;  74,322  Catholic  males;  27,896  Protestant 
females;  25,939  Protestant  males;  28  Chinese;  923  Jewesses;  1005  Jews;  or,  a 
total  population  of  211,302. 

The  Nationalities  are  printed  on  pages  22  and  23;  with  the  Recapitulation  on 
page  21. 

In  this  matter  of  Nationalities  the  Enumerators  had  much  to  contend  with,  in 
trying  to  explain  to  unwilling  citizens  the  object  of  taking  them.  A  few  would  not 
listen  to  reason  but  abruptly  declined  giving  any  information  relative  to  their  Nation- 
ality. Yet  it  is  pleasing  to  state  that  a  very  large  number  of  the  population  were 
glad  to  give  all  required  information.  At  times  six  or  eight  different  Nationalities 
were  found  in  a  single  dwelling,  causing  great  delay  in  securing  complete  and  accu- 
rate returns. 

My  Historic  Report  of  Census  of  Montreal  is  given  in  the  honest  belief  and 
conviction  that  it  will  be  found  as  correct  as  the  means  available  would  allow. 

My  sincere  thanks  are  tendered  to  the  several  Religious,  Benevolent  and  Charit- 
able Institutions  for  satisfactory  answers  to  direct  questions,  and  especially  to  the 
Ladies  of  the  Grey  Nunnery,  for  devoting  five  hours  of  their  valuable  time  to  the  task 
of  verifying  the  statistics  relative  to  their  institution.  The  Lady  Superioress,  without 
a  moment's  hesitation,  authorized  two  of  the  Reverend  Sisters  to  give  me  all  the

information  I  wanted.  They  accordingly  went  to  their  vaults  in  search  of  records, 
papers  and  books  that  contained  dates  and  other  information,  now  printed  in  this 
Historic  Report  as  a  correct  statement  to  January,  1891.  I  might  single  out  other 
institutions,  but  where  all  were  desirous  of  giving  full  and  unreserved  details,  my 
sincere  thanks  are  tendered  to  all. 

To  the  writer  of  the  able  and  interesting  "  Historical  Sketch  of  Montp.eal," 
I  beg  to  offer  my  sincere  and  heartfelt  thanks. 

To  Charles  Glackmever,  Esq.,  our  estimable  and  obliging  City  Clerk,  and  to 
William  Robb,  Esq.,  our  able  and  worthy  City  Treasurer,  I  am  indebted  for  valuable 
data  relative  to  Municipal  affairs  and  the  City's  Financial  position. 

lam  deeply  indebted  to  my  old  friend,  Peter  Crossbv,  for  his  careful  and  trust- 
worthy account  of  the  Port  of  Montreal. 

To  Alexander  Robertson,  Esquire,  Secretary  of  the  Harbor  Commissioners,  I 
cheeringly  offer  my  thanks  for  statements  and  figures  which  give  additional  value  to 
Mr.  Crossby's  sketch. 

To  Mr.  E.  J.  GoLLiFER,  my  indefatigable  and  trustworthy  assistant,  for  collecting 
information  from  Religious,  Benevolent  and  Charitable  Institutions,  my  best  thanks 
are  offered . 

To  the  energetic,  painstaking  and  intelligent  staff  of  Sixty  Enumerators  I 
have  pleasure  in  saying  that  they  worthily  earned  my  confidence  and  esteem. 

To  my  Office  Staff  of  twelve  intelligent  and  painstaking  Youno  Girls,  and 
to  two  first-class  Arithmeticians,  Joseph  L.  Smith  and  Emile  Handcock,  from 
whom  I  received  constant  and  able  assistance,  thanks  are  also  due.     Their  task  was 
to  examine  and  arrange  2771   sheets  of  524  Streets,  Squares,  etc.,  returned  by  the 
Enumerators. 

To  reduce  to  alphabetical  order,  and  secure  uniformity  and  accuracy,  the  column 
of  clerical,  legal  and  nriedical  professions,  mercantile  and  other  callings,  and  trades,  or 
as  the  cape  might  be,  had  to  be  copied  and  collated  three  different  times.  The 
additions  and  checking  were  most  arduous,  but  the  work  had  to  be  done.  277  i  sheets 
of  II  columns  each  with  17  lines  on  the  sheet,  gave  a  total  addition  of  30,481 
columns,  and,  consequently,  a  like  quantity  of  checking.  In  addition  to  these, 
30  Nationalities  contained  in  412  Forms,  and  arranged  under  212  separate  headings, 
were  compared,  copied  and  checked,  the  result  being  the  totals  as  found  on  pages  22 
and  23  of  this  work. 

The  anxious  labor  and  effectiveness  of  all  wlio  were  engaged  on  the  work  are 
worthy  of  all  praise. 

Tliese  details  are  given  as  a  reasonable  cause  of  delay  in  the  issue  of  this  Census 
Report.  .Some  extra  copies  have  been  printed,  with  the  hope  that  they  may  be  sold 
for  transmission  to  friends  in  the  Mother  Country  and  elsewhere.  For  myself  I  will 
send  one  thousand  copies  to  The  Press  of  this  Canada  of  ours  ;  to  leading  papers 
in  New  York,  Boston,  Philadelphia,  Baltimore,  New  Orleans,  Richmond,  Chicago, 
Buffalo,  and  Detroit ;  to  some  leading  papers  in  England,  Scotland,  and  Ireland, 
as  well  as  to  journals  in  France,  Germany,  and  Belgium. 

To  The  Prks.s  of  this  City  I  am  deeply  indebted  for  the  public  spirited  and 
kindly  manner  in  which  they  noticed  the  Prospectus  of  this  work.

URIl TKN    KXl'RKSSI.Y    KiiR    LOVELI/S    IIISTORIC    RErORT    OF    CENSUS   OK    MONTREAI,, 

Next  Year  (1892)  Americans  of  every  name  will  be  commemorating,  as  is  most 
meet,  the  discovery  of  this  "■estem  licmisjjhere  by  Columbus,  four  hundred  years 
before.  In  the  same  year  the  people  of  Montreal  will  also  be  celebrating  the  two 
hundred  and  fiftieth  anniversary  of  the  foundation  of  their  city  by  De  Maisonneuve. 
But  its  antiquity  ought  not  really  to  be  bounded  by  that  formal  act.  Even  if  we 
]tass  over  the  fact  that  Champlain  had  actually,  in  161 1,  begun  the  work  of  clearing 
and  building  on  the  very  point  that  De  Maisonneuve  subseijuently  selected  for  his 
fortress  and  habitation — giving  it  the  very  name,  Plate  Koya/e,  which  it  bore  long 
afterwards, — it  must  not  be  forgotten  tluit  Montreal  is  one  of  the  rare  instances  of  a 
I'airopean  city  having  been  superimposed  upon  an  Indian  town.  More  than  a  hundred 
years  before  I  )e  Maisonneuve,  with  the  solemn  rUes  of  the  (Munch,  consecrated 
to  the  Virgin  Mother  the  capital  of  his  colony,  a  fortified  Iwitii^tuie  stood  at  the 
base  of  the  trai)];ean  liill,  from  wliich  Montreal  receives  its  name.  How  long  it 
had  occupied  that  position  of  ])re-eminence  we  can  only  conjecture.  But  the 
fact,  that  in  the  early  part  of  the  sixtcentii  century  it  was  the  strong  dwclling-i)lace 
of  an  ajjpareiuly  thriving  community,  shows  tliat  its  admirable  natural  advantages 
had  been  recognized  even  by  t!ie  rude  predecessors  of  its  civilized  inhabitants. 
Tiie  sight  that  greeted  the  eyes  of  the  hardy  mariner  of  St.  Malo  and  his  brave  com- 
panions was  an  augury  of  tlie  greatness  and  prosi)erity  of  Montreal  in  days  to  come, 
when  the  din  of  strife  should  have  been  succeeded  by  the  sounds  of  manifold  industry. 

It  was  a  happy  instinct  which  impelled  the  children  of  the  forest  to  make  a  strong- 
hold of  Hochelaga.  For  security,  for  shelter,  for  convenience  of  rendezvous,  no 
point  could  jiresent  better  facilities,  so  that  its  choice  by  tiiose  rude  warriors  and 
hunters  was  an  unconscious  forecast  of  its  remoter  and  grander  destinies.  By  patient, 
far-seeing  nature  those  destinies  had,  indeed,  been  marked  out  in  the  very  dawn  of 
time.  The  slow  preparation  for  fulfilment  began  when  the  iirimeval  germ  of  the  con- 
tinent rose,  bleak  and  lifeless,  above  the  arclnvan  sea.  By  the  unhurrying  action  of 
miglity  forces,  below  and  above,  its  foundations  iiad  been  laid  deep  and  solid.  The 
throes  of  the  volcano  raised  aloft  its  mountain  bulwark.  True  father  of  waters, 
the  yet  nameless  St.  Lawrence,  first  born  of  American  rivers,  had  indicated  it  as 
the  f////r/&gt;&lt;5/ of  mighty  nations  ere  yet  the  Mississippi  Valley  had  emerged  from  the 
primal  ocean. 

Evidently,  therefore,  the  history  of  Montreal  embraces  three  successive  periods, — 
the  Aboriginal,  the  French,  and  the  Britisii.  The  first  of  these  divisions,  though  it 
admits  of  voluminous  treatment,  involving,  as  it  necessarily  does,  a  (piestion  of  the 
utmost  value  to  ethnologists,  is  mainly  interesting  to  the  general  reader  for  its 
association  with  jaccpies  Cartier.  The  story  of  that  explorer's  visit  to  Hochelaga  has 
been  told  by  many  writers,  and  is  familiar  to  every  Canadian  school  boy.  He  was  born 
at  St.  Malo,  in  Brittany,  in  the  year  1500.  In  1534  he  first  crossed  the  Atlantic,  the 
route  being  already  frequented  by  Basque  and  Breton  fishermen,  and,  having  entered

the  Gulf,  named  the  Baie  des  Chaleiirs,  made  acquaintance  with  the  natives  of  our 
coast  land,  and  set  u]&gt;  across  with  a  French  escutcheon  ;  he  returned  to  France  wuh  a 
couple  of  Indians,  who  afterwards  served  him  as  interpreters.     Next  year  (1535) 
he  again  entered  our  great  water-way,  to  which  he  gave  the  name  which  it  has  ever 
since     been    proud    to  bear.     His   scjuadron    consisted    of  La    Grande   Hermine 
(from  100  to  120  tons  burden),  which  he  commanded  in  person  :  La  Petite  Hermine 
(of  60  tons),  in  command  of  Mace  Jalobert,  Cartier's  brother-in-law  ;  and  the  Evicr- 
illon  (of  40  tons),  in  charge  of  Guillaume  Le  Breton.     Accompanying  the   leader  of 
the  expedition  were  several  persons  of  note,  members  of  noble  families,  such  as  Claude 
de  Ponlbriand,  son  of  the  Seigneur  de  Montreuil,   and  cup  bearer  to  the  Dauphin  ; 
Charles  de  la  Pommeraye  and  Jehan  Poullet ;  the  names  of  the  crews  have  also  been 
preserved  in  the  archives  of  St.  Malo.     The  total  enumeration  comprises  74  names. 
Reaching   Stadacc.ia  (Quebec),   Cartier  was  cordially  received  by  Donnacona,   die 
chief  of  the   tiib  -s   which  had  their  headquarters  at  that  place.      lUit  when  it  was 
perceived  that  the  strangers  purposed  advancing  still  further  up  the  river,  all  kinds 
of  dissuasive  arguments  were  employed  to  deter  the  daring  explorer  from  such  an 
attempt.      The  chiefs,  finding  their  oratorical  powers  unavailing,  had  recourse  (says 
the  record)  to  a  ruse,  by  which,  if  possible,  to  arouse  the  superstitious  fears  of  the 
adventurers.     Cartier,  however,  was  nut  to  be  diverted  from   his  course  ;    on    the 
17th  of  September  he  began   the  arduous  ascent,  and  on   the  2nd  of  October  he 
reached  the  site  of  Canada's  future  nietroi)olis. 

What  ensued  may  be  fitly  described  in  the  ancient  mariner's  own  langijage*  as 
urned  into  English  by  the  Rev.  Richard  Hakluyt: — 

'•  Tlie  captaine  the  next  clay  very  eaiely  in  the  morning,  having  attiied  hiniselfe,  caused  all  his  com. 
pany  to  be  set  in  order  to  go  to  see  the  towne  and  habitation  of  those  people,  and  a  certaine  mountaine 
that  is  neere  the  citie  ;  witli  whom  went  also  the  gentlemen  and  twenty  mariners,  leaving  the  rest  to 
keepe  and  looke  to  our  boates  ;  we  tooke  with  us  three  men  of  Hochelaga  to  bring  us  to  the  place. 

*  In  order  that  the  French  reader,  or  the  English  reader,  who  is  a  student  of  the  French  language 
and  literature,  may  have  an  opportunity  of  contrasting  Jacques  Cartier's  speech  with  the  modern 
tongue,  an  extract  from  the  original  of  the  passage  quoted  is  here  appended  : — 

Le  lendemain  au  plus  matin,  le  Capitaine  s'accoustra,  et  fist  mettre  ses  gens  en  ordre  pour  aller 
voir  la  ville  et  demcurance  du  dit  peuple,  et  une  montagne  qui  est  jacente  a  la  dite  ville,  ou  all^rent 
avecque  le  dit  Capitaine  les  gentils-hommes,  et  vingt  mariniers,  et  laissa  le  parsus  pour  la  garde  des 
barques,  et  prit  trois  hommes  de  la  dite  ville  de  Hochelaga  pour  les  mener  et  conduire  au  dit  lieu.  Et 
nous  estans  en  chemin,  le  trouvasmes  aussi  battu  qu'il  soit  possible  de  voir,  en  la  plus  belle  terre  et 
meilleure  plaine  :  des  chenes  aussi  beaux  qu'il  y  en  ait  en  for^t  de  France,  sous  lesquels  estoit  toute  la 
terre  couverte  de  glands.  Et  nous,  ayant  fait  environ  une  lieu  et  demie,  (*)  trouvasmes  sur  le  chemin 
I'un  des  principaux  de  la  dite  ville  de  Hochelaga,  avecque  plusieurs  personnes,  lequel  nous  fist  signe 
qu'il  se  falloit  reposer  au  dit  lieu  prfes  un  feu  qu'ils  avoient  fait  au  dit  chemin.  Et  lors  commen9a  le 
dit  Seigneur  i  faire  un  sermon  et  preschement,  comme  ci-devant  est  dit  Stre  leur  coutume  de  faire 
joye  et  connoissance,  en  faisant  celui  Seigneur  ch^re  au  dit  Capitaine  ct  sa  compagnie  ;  lequel  Capi- 
taine lui  donna  une  couple  de  haches  et  une  couple  de  couteaux,  avec  une  Croix  et  remembrance  du 
Crucifix  qu'il  lui  fist  baiser,  et  lui  pendit  au  col :  de  quoi  il  rendit  graces  au  dit  Capitaine.  Ce  fait, 
marchames  plus  outre,  et  environ  demie  lieue  de  U  commen^ames  il  trouver  les  terres  labour^&lt;;s,  et 
belles  grandes  campagnes  pleines  de  bl6  de  leurs  terres,  qui  est  comme  mil  de  Bresil,  aussi  gros  ou 
plus  que  pois,  (t)  duquel  ils  vivent,  ainsi  que  nous  faisons  de  froment.  Et  au  parmi  d'icelles  cam- 
pagnes est  situ^e  et  assise  la  dite  ville  de  Hochelaga,  (J)  pr^s  et  joignante  une  montagne  qui  est  ^ 
I'entour  d'icelle,  bien  labouree  et  fort  fertile  :  de  dessus  laquelle  on  voit  fort  loin.  Nous  nommasmes

The  Story  of  it^  Foundation.

AH  along  as  we  went  we  found  the  way  as  well  beaten  and  frequented  as  can  be,  the  fairest  and  best 
country  that  possibly  can  be  scene,  full  of  as  goodly  great  okes  as  are  in  any  wood  in  France,  under 
which  the  ground  was  all  covered  over  with  faire  akornes.  After  we  had  gone  about  league  and  a  half 
we  met  by  the  way  one  of  the  chiefest  lords  of  the  citie,  accompanied  with  many  nioe,  who  so  soone  as 
he  sawe  us  beckned  and  made  signes  upon  us,  that  we  must  rest  in  that  place  where  they  had  a  great 
fire,  and  so  we  did.  Then  the  said  lord  began  to  make  a  long  discourse,  even  as  we  have  saide  above, 
they  are  accustomed  to  doe  in  signe  of  mirtli  and  friendship,  shewing  our  captaine  and  all  his  company 
a  joyful  countenance  and  good  will;  who  gave  him  two  htitchets,  a  paire  of  knives  and  a  crucifix, 
which  he  made  him  to  kisse,  and  then  put  it  about  his  necke,  for  which  he  gave  our  captaine  hearlie 
thankes.  This  done,  we  went  along,  and  about  half  a  league  farther,  we  began  to  finde  goodly 
and  large  cultivated  fieldes,  full  of  such  corne  as  the  countrie  yeeldeth.  It  is  even  as  the  millet  of 
IJresil,  as  great  and  sonievvhat  bigger  than  small  peason,  wherewitii  they  live  even  as  we  doe  tvith  our 
wheat.  In  the  midst  of  those  fields  is  the  citie  of  Ilochelaga,  placed  ncere,  and  as  it  were  joyned  to  a 
great  mountaine,  that  is  tilled  round  about,  very  feriill,  on  the  top  of  which  you  may  see  very  farre.  We 
named  it  Mount  Koiall.  The  citie  of  Ilochelaga  is  round,  compassed  about  with  timber,  with  three 
course  of  rampires,  one  within  another  framed  like  a  sharp  spire,  or  pyramid,  but  laid  aciosse  abo\  j. 
The  middlemost  of  them  is  perpendicular.  The  rampires  are  framed  and  fashioned  with  pieces  of  timber 
layd  along  very  well  and  cunningly  joyned  togither  after  their  fashion.  This  enclosure  is  in  height  about 
two  rods.  It  hath  but  one  gate  or  eiitrie  thereat,  which  is  shut  with  piles,  stakes  and  banes.  Over  it, 
and  also  in  many  places  of  the  wall,  there  is  a  kind  of  gallery  to  runne  along,  and  ladders  to  get  up, 
all  full  of  stones  and  pebbles  for  the  defence  of  it.  There  are  in  the  towne  about  fiftie  houses,  at  the 
utmost  about  fiflie  jiaces  long,  and  twelve  or  fifteen  broad,  built  all  of  wood,  Covered  over  with  the 
barke  of  the  wood,  as  broad  as  any  boord,  very  finely  and  cunningly  joyned  to-jither  according  to  their 
fashion.  Within  the  said  houses,  there  are  many  roomes.  In  the  midest  of  every  one  there  is  a  great 
hall  m  the  middle  whereof  they  make  their  fire.  They  live  in  common  togither  :  then  doe  the  husbands, 
wives  and  children  each  one  retire  themselves  to  their  chambers.  They  have  also  on  thi  top  of  their 
houses  certaine  granaries,  wherein  they  keepe  their  corne  to  make  their  bread  withall  ;  they  call  it  Cara  • 
cony,  which  they  make  as  hereafter  shall  follow.  They  have  certaine  peeces  of  wood,  like  those  whereon 
we  beat  our  hempe,  and  with  certain  beetles  of  wood  they  beat  their  corne  to  powder  ;  then  they  make 
paste  of  it,  and  of  the  paste,  cakes  or  wreathes,  then  they  lay  them  on  a  broad  and  hole  stone,  and 
then  cover  it  with  hole  pebbles,  and  so  they  bake  their  bread  instead  of  ovens.  They  make  also  sundry 
sorts  of  pottage  with  the  said  cjrne  and  also  of  peas  and  beanes,  whereof  they  have  great  store,  as  also 
with  other  fruits,  great  cowcumbers  and  other  fruits.  They  have  also  in  their  houses  certaine  vessels 
as  bigge  as  any  Hut  or  Tun,  wherein  they  keepe  their  fish,  causing  the  same  in  sommer  to  be  dried  in 
the  smoke,  and  live  therewith  in  winter,  whereof  they  make  great  provision,  as  we  by  experience  have 
scene.  All  their  viands  and  meats  are  without  any  taste  or  savour  of  salt  at  all.  They  sleepe  upon 
barkes  of  trees  laid  all  along  upon  the  ground,  being  over-spread  with  the  skinnes  of  certaine  wilde 
Beastes,  wherewith  they  also  clothe  and  cover  themselves,  namely,  of  the  Dormouse,  Heaver,  Martin, 
Fox,  Wild  Cat,  Deer,  Stag,  and  other  wild  beasts,  but  the  greater  part  of  them  go  almost  naked 
(during  the  sommer).  The  thing  most  precious  that  they  have  in  all  the  world  they  call  Esurgny,* 
which  is  white,  and  which  they  take  in  the  said  river  in  Cornibots,  in  the  manner  following  :  When  any 
one  hath  deserved  death,  or  that  they  take  any  of  their  enemies  in  wanes,  first  they  kill  him,  then  witii 
certaine  knives  they  give  great  slashes  and  strokes  upon  their  buttocks,  flankes,  thighs  and  shoulders;, 
then  they  cast  the  same  bodie  so  mangled  downe  to  the  bottome  of  the  river,  in  a  place  where  the  said 
Esurgny  is,  and  there  leave  it  ten  or  twelve  houres,  then  they  take  it  up  againe,  and  in  the  cuts  find  the 
said  esurgny  or  cornibots.  Of  them  they  make  beads,  and  use  them  even  as  we  doe  gold  and  silver, 
accounting  it  the  preciousest  thing  in  the  world.  They  have  this  vertue  in  them,  they  will  stop  or 
stench  bleeding  at  the  nose,  for  we  proved  it.  These  people  are  given  to  no  other  exercise,  but  onely 
to  husbandrie  and  fishing  for  their  sustenance  :  they  have  no  care  of  any  oth;r  wealth  o"  commoditie 
in  this  world,  for  they  have  no  knowledge  of  it,  and  never  travell  an  1  go  oat  of  their  cou  itry,  as  those  of 
Canada  and  Saguenay  doe,  albeit  the  Canadians  with  eight  or  nine  villages  more  alongst  that  rive.'  he 
subject  unto  them.

Historical  Sketch  of  Montreal . 


"  So  soone  as  we  were  come  neere  the  towne,  a  great  number  of  the  inhabitants  thereof  came  to 
present  themselves  before  us,  after  their  fashion,  making  very  mucli  of  us  :  we  were  by  our  guides 
brought  into  the  middestof  the  towne.     They  have  in  the  middlemost  part  of  tlieir  towne  a  large  square 
)&gt;lace,  being  from  side  to  side  a  good  stone   cast,  whither  we  were  brought,  and  there  with  signes  were 
commanded  to  stay,  and  so  we  did  :  then  suddenly  all  the  women  and  maidens  of  the  towne  gathered 
themselves  together,  part  of  which  had  their  amies  full  of  young  children,  and  as  many  as  could  came 
to  kiss  our  faces,  our  amies,  and  what  part  of  the  bodie  soever  they  could  touch,  weeping  for  very  joy 
that  they  saw  us,   shewing  us  the  best  countenance   that  possibly  they  could,   desiring  us  with  their 
signes,  that  it  wojld  please  us  to  touch  their  children.     That  done,  the  men  caused  tlie  women  to 
withdraw  tliemselves  backe,  tlien  they  every  one  sate  down  on  the  ground  round  about  us,   as  if  we 
would  have  shewen  and  rehearsed  somecomedie  or  other  shew  :  then  presently  came  the  women  againe, 
every  one  bringing  a  fouresquare  matte  in  manner  of  carpets,  and  spreading  them  abroad  on  the  ground 
ill  that  place,  they  caused  us  to  sit  upon  them.     That  done,    the  lord  and  king  of  the  country  was 
brought  upon  nine  or  ten  men's  shoulders  (whom  in  their  tongue  they  called  Agouhanna),  sitting  upon 
a  great  slagge's  skinne,  and  they  laid  him  downe  upon  the  foresaid  mattes  neere  to  the  captaine,  every  one 
beckning  unto  us  that  hee  was  their  lord.     This  Agouhanna  was  a  man  about  fiftie  yeeres  old;  he  was 
no  whit  better  apparelled  than  any  of  the  rest,  onely  excepted  that  he  li.id  a  certaine  tiling  around  his 
he.id  m.-ide  of  the  skiniies  of  hedgehogs*  like  a  red  wreath.   He  was  full  of  the  palsie,  and  his  members 
slironke  together.     After  he  had  with  certaine  signes  saluted  our  captaine  and  all  his  companie,  and  by 
jiianifest  tokens  bid  all  welcome,   he  shewed  his  legges  and  amies  to  our  captaine,  and   with   signes, 
■desired  him  to  touch  iheni,  and   so  he  did,  rubbing  them  with  his  own  hands  :  then  did   Agouhanna 
t.ake  the  wreath  or  crowne  he  had  about  his  head,  and  gave  it  unto  our  captaine  ;  that  done  they  brought 
before  him  diverse  diseased  men,  some  blinde,  some  criple,  some  lame  and  impotent,  and  some  so  old 
that  tlie  haire  of  their  eyelids  came  downe  and  covered   their  cheekes,  and  layd   them  all  along  before 
our  captaine,    to  the  end  they  might  of  him  be  touched;  for  it  seemed  unto  them  that  G?d  was  des- 
cended and  come  down  from  heaven  to  heale  them.     Our  captaine,  seeing  the  misery  and  devoiir-i  of 
this  poore  people,  recited  the  Gospel  of  St.  John,  that  is  to  say,    '  In  the  beginning  was  the   Word, 
in.iking  the  signe  of  the  cross  upon  the  poor  sick  ones,  praying  to  God  that  it  would  please  him  to  open 
the  hearts  of  this  jioore  people,  and  to  make  them  know  our  holy  faith,  and  that  they  might  receive 
baptisiiie  and  christendonie  ;    that  done,  he  took   a  service-booke  in   his  hand,   and  with  a   loud  voice 
read  all  the  passion  of  Christ,  word  by  word,  that  all  the  standers  by  might  lieare  him,  all  which  while 
this  poore  people  kept  silence,   and  were  marvellously  attentive,  looking  up  to  heaven,  and  imitating 
us  in  gestures.  Then  he  caused  tlie  men  all  orderly  to  be  set  on  one  side,  the  women  on  another,  and 
likewise  the  children  on  another,  and  to  the  chiefest  of  them  he  gave  hatchets,  to  the  other  knives,  and 
to  the  women  be.ids  and  such  other  small  trifles.     Then  whereby  children  were  he  cast  rings,   counters 
an&lt;4  broaches  made  of  tin,+  whereat  they  seemed  to  be  very  glad.  That  done,  our  captaine  commanded 
trumpets  and  other  rausicall  instruments  to  be  sounded,  which  when  tliey  heard  they  were  very  merie. 
Then    we  took  our  leave  and  went  away  ;  the  women  seeing  that  put  themselves  before  to  stay  us,  and 
brought  us  out  of  their  meates  that  they  had  made  readie  for  us,  as  fish)  pottage,  beanes,  and  such  other 
ihings,  thinking  to  make  us  eate  .and  dine  in  that  place ;  but  because  the  meates  were  not  to  our  taste 
we  liked  them  not  but  thanked  them,  and  with  signes  gave  to  understand  that  we  had  no  neede  to  eate. 
When  we  were  out  of  the  towne,  diverse  of  the  men  and  women  followed  us,  and  brought  us  to  the  toppe 
of  the  foresaid  mountaine,  which  wee  named  Mount  Koiall,  it  is  about  a  quarter  of  a  league  from  the 
towne.     When  as  we  were  on  the  toppe  of  it,  we  might  discerne  and  plainly  see  thirtie  leagues  about. 
On  the  north  side  of  it  there  are  many  hilles  to  be  scene  running  west  and  east,  and  as  many  more  on 
the  south,  amongst  and  betweene  the  which  the  countrey  is  as  faire  and  as  pleasant  as  possible  can  be 
seene,  being  levell,  smooth,  and  very  plaine,fit  to  be  husbanded  and  tilled,  and  in  the  middest  of  those 
fieldes  we  saw  the  river  further  up  a  great  way  than  where  we  had  left  our  boates,  where  was  the  greatest 
and  the  swiftest  fall  of  water  that  any  where  hath  beene   seene  which  we  could  not  pass,  and  the  said 
river  as  great,  wide  and  large  as  our  sight   might  discerne,  going  southwest  along  three  fair  and  round 
mountaines  that  we  sawe,  as  we  judged  about  fifteen  leagues  from  us.     Those  which  brought  us  thither 
tolde  and  shtwed  us,  that  in  the  sayd  river  there  were  three  such  falles  of  water  more  as  that  was  where 
■we  had  left  our  boates ;  but  we  could  not  understand  how  farre  they  were  one  from  another.  Moreover,

ihey  showed  us  with  signes,  that  the  said  three  falles  l)eing  past,  a  man  might  sayle  the  space  of  tluee 
months  more  alongst  that  river,  and  that  along  the  hills  that  are  on  the  north  side  there  is  a  great 
river,  which  (even  as  the  other)  cometh  from  the  west.     We   thought  it  to  be  the  river  that  runneth 
through  the  countrey  of  Saguenay.    Then,  without  any  signe  or  question  mooved  or  asked  of  them,  they 
tooke  the  chayne  of  our  captaine's  whistle,  which  was  of  silver,  and  the  daggerhuft  of  one  of  our  fellow 
mariners  hanging  on  his  side.  '..■ "  g  of  yellow  copper  gilt,  and  shewed  us  that  such  stuflfe  came  from  the 
said  river,  and  that  there  b.  Agojudas,  that  is  as  much  to  say,  an  evill  jjeople,  who  goe  all  armed  even 
to  their  fingers'  ends.     Also  they  shewed  us  the  manner  of  their  armour;  they  are  made  of  cordes  and 
wood,  finely  and  cunningly  wrought  together.     They  gave  us  also  to  understande  that  those  Agojuda? 
doe  continually  warre  one  against  another  ;  but  liecause  we  did  not  understand  them  well,  we  could  not 
perceive  how  farre  it  was  to  that  countrey.     Our  captaine  shewde  them  redde  copper,  which  in  their 
language  they  call  Caquedaz^,  and  looking  towarde  that  countrey,  with  signes  aiked  them  if  any  came 
from  thence,  they  sh.iking  their  heads  answered  no  ;  but  ihey  shewed  us  that  it  came  from  Saguenay, 
and  that  lyelh  cleane  contrary  to  the  other.     After  we  had  heard  and  scene  these  things  of  them,  we 
drewe   to  our  boates   accompanied  with  a  great  multitude  of  those  people  ;  some  of  them,  when  they 
saweany  ofourfellowes  weary,  would  take  tliem  up  on  their  shoulders,  and  carry  them  as  on  horseback." 
Such  is  the  account  that  the  great  navigator  has  left  us  of  his  memorable  visit  to 
Hochelaga.     Many  attempts  have  been  made  to  identify  the  native  tribe  by  which 
he  was  so  cordially  received,  and  it  is  now  generally  admitted  that  the  little  settle- 
ment  was  of  the  great  Huron-Iroquois  family,  with  both  branches  of  which  the  early 
colonists  of  New  France  were  so  closely,  though  diversely,  associated.     This  conclu- 
sion has    been   reached  by  a  comparison  of  Cartier's  vocabularies  with  the  language 
spoken  at  a  later  date  by  the  confederate  Iroquois  and  their  Huron  kinsmen.     When,  in 
the  early  years  of  the  17th  century,  Samuel  de  Champlain  visited  the  scene  of  their 
sojourn,  all  traces  of  the  little  town  and  its  occupants  had  disappeared.     The  founder 
of  Quebec  was  not  unaware  of  the  importance  of  the  locality.     On  his  second  visit  in 
181 1  he  selected  and  cleared  a  space  of  ground,  near  the  mouth  of  a  small  stream  that 
entered  the  St.  I/iwrence  at  Poiiitc  a  Ca/licres,  where  theC'iistom  House  now  stands; 
and,    in   order  to  test  the  effects  of  the  ice-shove,  he  erected  a  river  wall  with  i^ric  ks 
made   out   of  clay    found   in   the   vicinity.     It  was  on   the  very  same  sj)ot  that  De 
Maisonneuve,  thirty-one  years  later,  landed  with  his  devoted  companions,  and  laid,  in 
humble  faith,  the  foundations  of  Ville  Marie.     The  impulse  wliich  moved  that  i)ious 
and  intrepid  company  to  establish  in  an  unknown  wilderness  in  the  New  World  a 
centre  of  evangelization — a  veritable  civitas  Dei,  as  the  more  sanguine  were  lain  to 
believe — has  been  laid  bare  in  recent  years  by  the  researches  of  Abbe  Verreau.    Willi- 
out  consulting  the  writings  of  that  learned  iiistorian,  especially  his  annotated  repro- 
duction of  the  Veritables  Motifs  de  Messieurs  et  Dames  de  Montreal,  it  is  impossible 
to   have  an  adequate   appreciation  of  the  aims  and  aspirations  of  that  pious  band. 
According  to  the  record  from  which  Mr.  Verreau's  diligence  has  raised  the  veil  of  twa 
centuries    and    a  half  of  silence   (for    it   was   virtually  out  of  print),  the  motives 
which   led   the    Societe  de  Notre  Dame  de  Montreal  to  undertake  its  apostolic  task 
were  all  of  a  spiritual  and  religions  character — a  fact  which  gives  the  beginnings  of 
Montreal  an  exceptional   interest  in   the   history   of  colonization.     The  visions  and 
revelations  that   preceded  and   prompted   the  enterprise  |may   have  a  basis    which 
modern  historical  criticism  may  find  insufficient,  and  Mr.  A'erreau  reminds  his  readers 
that  in   such   matters   the  Church  has   always    maintained  a  judicious  reserve.     But 
that   the  mission   was  due   to  strong  religious  convictions,  and  was  characterized  by 
^n  e.vtraordinary  share  of  that  fiiith  which,  as  we  are  told  on  good  authority,  can 
remove  mountains,  no  one  can  deny.

Historical  Sketch  of  Montreal 


It  was  on  the  iSth  of  May,  1642,  that  Paul  de  Choniedy,  Sieur  de  Maisonneuve 
(whose  life,  with  its  trials  and  triumphs  and  melancholy  close,  has  been  written 
by  Abbe  Rousseau,  P.S.S.),  planted,  as  Father  Viniont  said,  the  grain  of  mustard 
seed  that  was  destined  to  take  root,  to  grow  up,  and  to  overshadow  the  land.  M.  de 
Montmagny,  having  in  vain  tried  to  dissuade  M.  de  Maisonneuve  from  his  resolution, 
at  last  gracefully  yielded,  and  accompanied  the  pioneers  n\}  the  river,  so  as  to  instal 
the  tirst  governor  of  Montreal  in  his  office,  Leaping  ashore,  M.  de  Maisonneuve  and 
his  companions  fell  on  tlieir  knees,  and  with  hymns  of  praise  returned  thanks  to 
Providence  for  having  guided  them  to  the  land  of  promise.  An  altar  was  erected  and 
adorned  by  the  pious  hands  of  Madame  de  la  Peltrie  an&lt;l  Mademoiselle  Mance. 
Fatlier  Vimoni  intoned  the  Veiii  Creator  Spiritiis^  and  celcl)rated  the  sacrifice  of  the 
mass,  and  then  pronounced  a  benediction  on  the  great  work  thus  inaugurated.  It  is 
noteworthy  that,  instead  of  candle  or  lamp,  a  white  glass  bottle  filled  with  firc-fiies 
was  suspended  before  the  Eucharist,  and  Sister  Morin  has  recorded  that  tiie  light 
thus  afforded  was  equal  to  that  of  several  tapers. 

Around  the  stately  figure  of  De  Maisonneuve  there  gathered  men  and  women, 
whose  names  should  not  be  forgotten.  Among  them  were  Father  Poncet,  M.  de 
Puiseau.x,  Mile.  Mance,  Mdmc.  de  la  Peltric,  Mile.  Catherine  Barre,  Jean  (lorry,  Jean 
Robelin,  Augustin  Hebert,  Antoine  Damien,  Jean  Caillot,  Pierre  Laimery,  Nicholas 
Gode  and  Fran(;ois  Gadois,  with  his  wife  and  their  four  children.  All  these  were  in 
Montreal  in  the  summer  of  1642.  During  the  succeeding  twelve  months  (  1642-43) 
the  following  additions  were  made  to  the  pojjulation  : —

The  dwellings  of  the  little  community  were  clustered  together,  the  whole  settlement 
being  surrounded  by  palisades  of  wood  and  stone.  'l"he  whole  group  of  habita- 
tions was  known  as  the  l-'ort  and  Chateau  of  Ville  Marie.  The  scene  with  which  the 
fir&gt;t  new  coirers  made  acquaintance  in  the  season  of  luxuriant  vegetation  was 
one  of  exceeding  beauty.  Away  behind  rose  Mount  Royal,  clad  in  budding  verdure, 
while  past  the  little  fortress  village  swept  the  grand  St.  Lawrence — both  in  their 
names  recalling  the  visit  of  Jacques  Cartier,  as  St.  Helen's  recalls  Champlain  (whose 
wifes  name  it  bears)  and  St.  Paul's  does  honor  to  De  Maisonneuve  himself.  But 
the  beauty  of  their  surroundings  could  not  make  the  pioneers  forget  the  lurking  peril 
of  the  thick  forest  that  almost  encircled  them. 

It  was  not,  however,  from  that  source  that  the  first  ordeal  through  which  they 
were  called  to  pass  had  its  origin.  Against  the  raids  of  the  Iroquois  all  due  precau- 
tions had  been  taken,  but  there  was  another  foe  against  whose  encroachments  no 
thought  of  defence  had  as  yet  occurred  to  the  settlers.  "  In  the  month  of  December, 
1642,"  writes  Abbe  Faillcn  in  his  Ifiitoire  de  la  Colonie  Fran(aise,  "an  unforeseen 
event  that  overtook  the  pious  colonists  increased  their  confidence  in  the  divine  good- 
ness.    Nor,  if  we  judge  by  the  results  which  followed,  can  we  help  thinking  that  God

only  permitted  it  in  order  to  give  them  a  fresh  mark  of  His  fatherly  care.  When  M. 
de  Maisonneiivc  selected  the  Place  Royale  as  the  site  of  the  fort  of  Ville  Marie,  the 
locality,  as  already  mentioned,  seemed  to  offer  many  advantages.  But,  not  having 
yet  resided  in  the  country,  he  did  not  foresee  that  the  River  St.  Lav.-rence,  notwith- 
standing its  breadth,  which  is  some  three-quarters  of  a  league  at  that  point,  might  leave 
'ts  bed  and  inundate  the  neighboring  grounds.  In  the  month  of  December,  in 
the  same  year,  1642,  it  overflowed  its  banks  to  an  extraordinary  degree,  and  in  a  few 
moments  covered  all  the  environs  of  ihe  Fort.  At  last  as  the  flood  augmented 
more  and  more,  everyone  retired  within  that  place  of  safety  and  ha  1  recourse  to 
prayer  to  turn  aside  so  disastrous  a  visitation.  The  little  stream  on  the  bank 
of  which  the  Fort  had  been  built  hi.d  alre.idy  begun  to  overflow,  when  M.  de  Mai- 
sonneuve,  moved  by  a  lively  sentiment  of  taith  and  trust,  conceived  the  design  of 
planting  a  cross  on  the  bank  of  the  river,  so  that  it  might  please  God  to  keep  it 
within  its  bounds,  if  it  were  for  His  glory,  or  that  He  might  make  known  His 
will,  if  He  wished  to  be  served  in  some  other  part  of  the  island,  in  case  the  lately 
erected  habitation  should  be  overwhelmed  by  the  waters.  He  declared  his  purpose 
to  the  Jesuit  Fathers,  who  approved  of  it,  and  also  made  it  publicly  known  to  the 
colonists,  who,  aware  of  the  purity  of  his  intentions,  were  of  one  heart  with  him  as  to 
the  religious  act  whiih  he  h.ad  determined  on.  He  accordingly  .set  up  the  cross,  at 
the  same  time  making  a  solemn  promise  to  God  to  carry  another  cross  to  the  summit 
of  he  mountain  if  his  |)rayer  should  be  heard.  But  it  was  God's  will  to  purify  the 
faith  of  those  zealous  colonists  as  He  had  formerly  perfected  Abraham  by  the  trials 
to  which  He  exposed  him.  The  waters  still  rose,  rolling  in  great  waves,  till  they  had 
filled  up  the  ditches  of  the  Fort,  approaching  even  to  the  threshold,  and  menacing 
with  their  fury  the  buildings  in  which  were  stored  the  munitions  of  war  and  the 
provisions  for  the  subsistence  of  the  colony.  Nevertheless,  alarming  ihough  the 
spectacle  was,  none  murmured  at  the  dispensation,  which  they  accep-ted  without  fear 
and  even  without  disquietude,  though  it  was  midwinter,  even  the  day  of  the  Lord's 
Nativity.  M.  de  Maisonneuve  was  especially  courageous,  hoping  that  in  good  time 
his  prayer  would  be  heard.  And  that  is  just  what  happened,  for  the  waters,  having 
lingered  a  while  at  the  gate  of  the  Fort,  without  passing  further,  gradually  retired, 
and  thus  freed  the  colony  from  the  threatened  danger.' 

M.  de  Maisonneuve,  in  his  gratitude  at  so  signal  a  deliverance,  was  not  forgetful 
of  his  vow.  Workmen  were  employed  to  clear  a  path  up  the  mountain,  while  the 
great  cross  was  being  hewed  into  shape,  and  on  the  6th  of  January  (Epiphany), 
1643,  all  being  in  readiness,  the  cross  was  solemnly  blessed,  and  the  procession  set 
out  on  its  journey  up  the  mountain.  M.  de  Maisonneuve  bore  the  cross  himself, 
though  it  was  of  no  light  weight  and  though  the  road  was  rough.  An  altar  was  duly 
erected  on  the  mountain,  and  Mr.  Duperron  celebrated  mass,  Madame  de  la  Peltrie 
being  the  first  to  communicate.  For  long  afterwards  the  cross  was  the  destination 
of  pious  pilgrimages.  .So  ended  the  first  Montreal  flood  of  which  history  has  pre- 
served the  record. 

The  Iroquois,  whose  notice  the  settlers  had  happily  escaped  during  the  first  few 
months,  no  sooner  saw  what  was  taking  place,  than  they  put  forth  all  their  ingenuity 
and  malice  in  their  efforts  to  undo  the  work  and  to  exterminate  the  workers. 

Some  Algonquins,  having  slain  an  Iroquois,  sought  refuge  within  the  walls  of  the 
Fort  from  the  tribesmen  who  undertook  to  avenge  his  death.     The  pursuers  saw  the 


32 


Historical  Sketch  of  Montreal: 


fugitives  enter  the  gates,  but  not  being  numerous  enough  to  assail  the  colony,  they 
contented  themselves  with  a  stealthy  examination  of  the  defences  against  their  return 
in  stronger  force.  It  was  not  long  till  the  murdered  Iroquois  was  more  than  avenged. 
In  June,  1643,  sixty  Hurons,  proceeding  from  their  country  with  letters  from  the 
Jesuit  Fathers,  came  upon  a  band  of  Iroquois  near  the  place  now  well-known  as 
Lachine,  to  whom,  in  order  to  secure  immunity  for  themselves,  they  treacherously 
suggested  an  attack  on  Ville  Marie.  The  Iroquois  accepted  the  advice,  and  detailed 
forty  of  their  number,  all  picked  warriors,  to  carry  out  the  raid.  It  so  happened 
that  just  then  six  Frenchmen  were  engaged  in  building  at  some  distance  from  the 
Fort,  and  these,  by  a  feigned  retreat,  were  decoyed  into  the  hands  of  the  enemy. 
Three  met  their  fate  on  the  spot.  The  other  three  were  taken  prisoners.  As  no  dan- 
ger had  been  apprehended  to  these  workmen — the  scene  of  their  labors  being  only 
about  two  hundred  feet  from  the  Fort  itself, — it  was  not  till  they  failed  to  make  their 
appearance  at  the  usual  hour  for  their  return  that  any  anxiety  was  felt  for  their  safety. 
The  fears  of  the  governor  and  his  companions  were  soon  realized.  The  lifeless 
body  of  (luillaume  Boissier,  bearing  the  marks  of  fierce  struggle  and  triumphant 
savage  ferocity,  was  a  silent  but  eloquent  witness  of  Ville  Marie's  initial  tragedy. 
Sadly  and  reverently  the  remains  of  the  dead  pioneer  were  borne  back  within  the 
I)recincts  of  the  town,  and  on  the  same  day  were  solemnly  laid  to  rest  in  a  smill 
enclosure  set  apart  for  a  burying-ground,  ad  confluxuni  tna}:,ni  et  parvi  Jluminis,* 

A  few  days  later,  the  bodies  of  two  of  his  companions,  Bernard  Berte  and  Pierre 
Laforest,  generally  called  rAiivergnat,  were  discovered  in  the  bush.  Of  the  three 
taken  prisoners,  one  escaped  ;  the  others  were  tortured  and  burned  by  the  Iroquois. 
After  that  display  of  savage  enmity  the  hostile  Indians  seldom  ceased  infesting  Ville- 
Marie. 

Meanwhile,  M.  de  Maisonneuve  kept  on  the  defensive.  The  consciousness  that 
on  his  prudence  and  judgment  the  safety  of  the  infant  colony  depended  made  him 
careful  nut  to  provoke  an  encounter  with  the  savages.  Again  and  again  he  resisted 
the  demands  of  the  bolder  spirits  of  his  small  garrison,  sensible  of  the  fearful  risks  of 
their  situation,  should  the  Iroquois  determine  to  assail  the  colony  en  masse.  Fear- 
less on  his  own  account,  he  had  not  dreamed  that  his  policy  of  self-restraint  would 
incur  the  imputation  of  lack  of  courage.  But  when,  after  the  loss  of  five  of  their 
number,  the  colonists  became  more  and  more  importunate  in  their  appeals  to  him  to 
lead  them  against  the  foe,  it  began  to  dawn  upon  him  that  his  motives  were  liable  to  be 
misunderstood,  and  that  the  only  way  to  convince  the  impatient  of  the  wisdom  of  his 
course  was  to  give  them,  under  his  own  leadership,  an  opportunity  of  testing  their 
exuberant  bravery.  Hitherto,  his  plans  for  the  protection  of  the  settlement  had  been 
admirably  devised.  Those  whose  duties  made  it  necessary  that  they  should  pass  daily 
beyond  the  environs  of  the  Fort  had  been  drilled  to  set  out  and  return  at  the  sound 
of  the  bell,  so  as  to  guard  against  surprise  from  the  Indians  who  were  wont  to  conceal 
themselves  in  the  underwood.  Another  effective  source  of  protection  consisted  in  a 
number  of  well-trained  dogs,  whose  instinct   enabled   them  to  scent  the   Iroquois. 


•  This  first  cemetery,  a  small  triangular  area  of  the  extremity  oi  PoiitU  (1  CallUres,  was  used  until 
1654,  when  that  of  tlie  Hotel-Dieu  succeeded  it.  The  reflection  that  the  spot  was  devoted  to  such  a 
purpose,  and  that  it  received  the  dust  and  ashes  of  Ville-Marie's  first  dead,  is  another  added  to  the  many 
claims  which  this  earliest  nucleus  of  their  city  has  upon  the  people  of  Montreal.  See  Bibliography,

Every  morning  regularly,  these  sagacious  animals,  headed  by  a  bitch  of  rare  endow- 
ments, well-nam-'d  Pilot,  formed  themselves  into  a  patrol  and  made  a  reconnoitring 
tour  all  over  the  town.     Pilot  was  a  veritable  martinet,  and  allowed  no  skulking  or 
lagging  on  the  part  of  her  canine  brigade.     Her  own  young  she  trained  to  be  genuine 
dogs  of  war,  administering  discii)line,  when  they  disobeyed  orders,  by  cuffs  and  bites, 
and  never  forgetting  to  punish  in  due  time  those  who  misbehaved  while  on  duty.  On 
perceiving  any  traces  of  the  Iroquois,  she  turned  back  promptly  and  made  straight 
for  the  Fort,  uttering  her  warning  bay  to  intimate  that  danger  was  nigh,     I5ut  even 
the  soldierly  quilities  of  Pilot,  and  the  faithful  services  that  she  rendered,  only  made 
the  malcontents  more  dissatisfied,  as  they  saw  the  honors  of  war  carried  off  by  a  dog. 
To  no  purpose  De  Maisonneuve  counselled  delay,  representing  that  ihey  were  far  too 
few  to  expose  themselves  to  the  multitude  of  the  enemy,  by  whom  a  loss  that  to  them 
would  be  destruction  would  hardly  be  felt.     At  last  the  governor  received  a  hint  that 
his  protective  policy  had  been  misconstrued,  and  though  to  such   a  man  any  insinua- 
tion of  cowardice  could  in  itself  have  seemed  merely  woithy  of  contempt,  it  was  of 
the  utmost  importance  that  no  doubt  on  such  a  subject  should  imi)air  his  influence 
with  his  people.     He  resolved,  therefore,  to  set  the  question  finally  at  rest  by  leading 
his  ardent  militia  forth  against  the  foe.     The  .30th  of  March,  1644,  was  a  day  that  the 
colonists  had  cause  to  remember  long  afterwards,  for  it  was  then  that  the  champions 
of  Montreal  had  their  first  serious  brush  with  the  Iro(iuois.     The  scene,  as  tradition 
has  placed  it  before  us,  stands  out  in  such  salient  contrast  to  the  Montreal  of  to-day 
that  it  is  not  easy  to  conjure  up  the  picture.     The  whole  stage  on  which   the  drama 
was  enacted,  Fort,  town,  bush,  combatants  on  both  sides,  lay  well  within   the  limil? 
of  the  present  city,  and  even  of  its  business  portion.     The  dogs  howled  their  deep 
notes  of  alarm,  the  soldiers  flew  to  their  arms,  every  loophole  in  the  little  fortress  was 
manned,  and  every  adit  covered  with  the  guns.     There  stood  the  governor,  cool  and 
tranquil  as  ever,  giving  his  directions  for  the  defence.     But  suddenly  his  countenance 
seemed  to  change,  the  exultant  radiance  of  the   warrior  overspread  it,  the   statesman 
was  transformed  into  tlie  soldier.     "  Yes,"  he  replied  to  those  who  clamored  for  battle, 
"  I  shall  lead  you  to  the  fray  myself."     It  was  near  the  close  of  winter,  but  the  snow 
was  still  deep;   walking  was  difficult,  and  the  supply  of  snow-shoes  was  defective,  but 
De  Maisonneuve  marshalled  his  men  and  made  the  best  of  wliat  equipment  he  had. 
Leaving  M.  d'Ailleboust  (who  had  arrived  some  time  before)  in  command  of  the  Fort, 
M.  de  Maisonneuve  marched  out  with  a  company  of  thirty  men  against,  as  we  are 
told,  from  eighty  to  two  hundred  Iroquois.     The  latter,  seeing  the  French  issue  forth, 
separated  into  three  bands  and  lay  in  wait  to  receive  them.     The  Montrealers  soon 
suffered  from  their  ignorance  of  woodcraft  and  lack  of  experience  of  Indian  war.iare. 
M.  de  Maisonneuve's  chief  trouble  was  to  prevent  them  exposing  themselves  to  the 
sweeping  fire  of  the  savages,  by  which  three  were  killed  and  many  wounded.     At  last 
he  got  them  under  cover,  and  they  retaliated  so  vigorously  that  in  a  short  time  their 
ammunition  was  all  spent.     Nothing  then  could  save  them  but  a  skilful  retreat.     The 
only  path  of  safety  was  the  trainean  road  that  had  been  levelled  to  cart  timber  for  the 
hospital,  and  thither  M.  de  Maisonneuve  directed  his  imperilled  company.     Once 
there,  locomotion  would  be  comparatively  easy,  as  snow-shoes  would  no  longer  be 
required.     In  their  actual  position  they  were,  as  an  old  writer  quaintly  says,  like  ill- 
furnished  infantry  against  well-mounted  dragoons.     The  soldiers  obeyed  those  instruc- 
tions readily  enough — too  readily,  indeed,  for  their  withdrawal  was  much  more  preci-

pitate  than  their  commander  desired,  and  than  became  men  who  had  burned  so  long 
to  meet  the  Iroquois  face  to  face.  The  consequence  was  that  the  cool,  courageous 
governor  was  soon  left  alone  in  the  presence  of  the  blood-thirsty  savages.  Armed 
wi'li  two  pistols,  he  kept  facing  the  foe  and  at  the  same  time  retreating.  That  he 
was  in  deadly  peril,  lie  knew,  had  the  Iroquois  aimed  only  at  taking  his  life.  But,  as 
the  leader  of  the  French  nation,  they  wislied  to  have  the  satisfaction  of  taking  him 
alive,  carrying  liim  home  in  triumph,  and  torturing  him.  They  made  way  for  their 
own  chief  that  he  might  have  the  distinction  of  such  a  capture,  and  the  savage  had 
almost  effei  ted  liis  purpose,  when  M.  de  Maisonneuve  turned  and  fired.  The  first 
shot  missed,  a  second  was  more  successful,  and  the  third  laid  the  pursuer  dead,  and 
gave  the  governor  time  to  escape.  For  the  savages,  dreading  lest  reinforcements 
arriving  should  wrest  tlie  corpse  from  their  possession,  gave  themselves  up  to  the 
task  of  rescuing  it,  and  no  lunger  troubled  themselves  with  M.  de  Maisonneuve. 
Meanwhile,  the  more  hasty  flight  of  iiis  men  had  very  nearly  ended  in  a  wholesale 
disaster.  I'or,  marking  the  sijced  with  which  they  made  for  the  Fort,  the  guards 
thought  tiiey  were  Indians,  and  prepared  to  deal  with  them  as  such.  One  soldier, 
with  more  dispatch  than  judgment,  attempted  to  discharge  a  canon  that  covered  the 
traincaii  road,  to  the  imminent  jeopardy  of  the  approaching  fugitives  who  looked  for  a 
very  different  reception.  Happily  dampness  prevented  the  fuse  igniting;  otherwise 
a  most  deplorable  catastrophe  would  have  closed  th.at  eventful  day.  One  important 
result  of  that  first  engagement  was  that  thereafter  the  cautious  policy  of  M.  de  Mai- 
sonneuve was  never  called  in  question.  A  great  historian  has  well  said,  in  connection 
with  this  event,  tiiat  "  .Samuel  de  (^hamplain  and  Chomedy  de  Maisonneuve  are  among 
tiic  names  that  shine  with  a  fair  and  honest  lustre  on  the  infancy  of  nations." 

As  the  area  of  habitation  enlarged,  fresh  means  of  protection  were  constantly 
required.  Like  the  Israelites  of  old,  they  held  their  building  implements  in  one  hand, 
their  weapons  of  warfare  in  the  other.  Already  in  1643  the  limits  of  the  Fort  were 
lound  too  narrow  to  accommodate  the  garrison  and  the  settlers.  A  hospital  and 
attached  chapel  were  then  erected,  and  surrounded  with  walls,  pierced  by  loopholes, 
and  strong  enough  to  resist  the  attacks  of  the  savages,  which  were  renewed  every 
spring.  The  tillers  of  the  soil  were  constant  objects  of  violence  or  treachery.  In 
1648,  a  new  redoubt  was  constructed  to  the  south  of  the  fort,  which  was  to  serve  as 
a  mill  and  post  of  observation.  In  1651,  M,  de  Maisonneuve  marked  out  a  common 
for  the  grazing  of  cattle,  an  arpent  broad  and  forty  arpents  long,  extending  along  the 
river,  where  we  no\y  find  Commissioners  and  Common  streets,  the  latter,  rue  de  la 
CommiDie,  preserving  tlie  record  of  the  event.  The  area  in  question  was  gradually 
resumed  into  the  domain  of  the  state,  to  be  built  upon  as  the  needs  of  the  citizens  and 
the  recpiirements  of  the  harbor  demanded.  In  1652,  Lambert  Closse,  lieutenant  of 
De  Maisonneuve,  with  certain  followers,  exterminated  a  band  of  Iroquois  not  far 
from  the  foot  of  the  present  McGill  street,  and  repulsed  another  band  at  Point  St, 
Charles,  where  a  redoubt  had  been  built. 

From  that  date  the  erection  of  houses  advanced  rapidly.  In  1654,  Sister  Bour- 
geois, the  founder  of  the  Congregation,  again  set  up  on  the  mountain  the  cross  which 
had  been  destroyed,  whether  by  frost  or  by  the  Iroquois.  At  the  same  time  a  new 
cemetery  was  marked  out,  where  the  Place  d Amies  is  to-day.  In  1656,  the  corner 
stone  of  a  large  church  was  laid  near  the  cemetery,  and  a  redoubt  was  built  at  the

turner  of  Notre  Pame  and  St.  Denis  streets,  to  protect  the  workmen  on  the  Coteau 
St.  r.ouis,  the  name  of  which  is  still  preserved  in  St.  Louis  street  and  ward. 

In  1657,  Sister  Bourgeois  commenced  building  llie  church  uf  Notre  Dame  de 
lionsecours,  and  in  the  following  year  M.  de  Maisonneuvc  gave  her  the  ground  to 
build  a  school,  which  was  taken  possession  of  on  the  ^oih  of  Ajjril,  the  day  of  St. 
Catherine  of  Sienna.  It  was  also  in  the  year  1657  that  the  first  Sulpicians  arrived. 
They  were  lodged  in  the  hospital  buildings.  At  the  same  time  a  new  redoubt  was 
erected  at  the  extremity  of  St.  Louis  Coteau,  where  Dalhousie  s(juarc  now  is.  Later, 
it  was  augmented  and  furnished  with  bastions  and  intrenchments,  and  was  called  the 
C/f(uM. 

In  1659,  there  were  forty  well  built  houses,  isolated  from  each  other,  with  thick 
walls  and  loop-holes,  but  close  enough  for  defence  in  case  of  attack.  ]}y  this  time 
the  bastions  of  the  early  I'ort  had  suffered  so  much  from  the  spring  ice  and  floods 
as  to  be  practically  of  little  use.  The  Fort  itself  served  still  as  a  residence  for  the 
governor.  Three  new  redoubts  were  built  in  this  year — that  of  Ste.  Marie,  at  the 
foot  of  the  current  which  bears  that  name  ;  that  of  St.  Gabriel,  so  called  by  Abbe 
Queylus  in  honor  of  his  patron  saint;  and,  thirdly,  to  the  north,  in  the  St.  Lawrence 
suburbs,  another  still,  given  by  M.  de  Maisonneuve  to  his  lieutenant,  Lambert  Closse, 
which  s'ood  where  the  Montreal  General  HosiMtal  now  stands.  Each  of  these 
redoubts  hatl  crenelated  walls  .for  tiie  defence  of  the  workmen's  lodges  and  the 
buildings  attached  to  them.  Closse  himself  left  the  Fort  and  went  to  live  with  the 
men  in  the  redoubt  which  lie  had  built,  from  wiiich  point  of  vantage  he  was  able  to 
guard  all  the  northern  part  of  the  city. 

.'\.  letter  from  M.  d'Argenson  describes  the  city  as  it  was  in  those  early  and  trying 
yeais:  "I  must,"  that  gentleman  writes,  "give  you  some  account  of  Montreal,  of 
which  place  so  much  noise  is  made,  although  it  is  in  itself  but  a  small  concern.  I 
s[)eak  of  what  I  know,  as  I  was  there  this  spring,  and  can  assure  you  that  if  I  were  a 
painter  I  would  not  take  long  to  depict  it.  Montreal  is  an  island,  rather  difficult  to 
land  on,  even  in  a  boat,  on  account  of  the  great  currents  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  espe- 
cially at  about  a  league  down  the  river.  There  is  a  port  where  the  boats  land,  but  it 
is  falling  in  ruins.  They  have  begun  a  redoubt  and  a  mill  on  an  advantageous  rising 
ground,  for  the  defence  of  the  habitation.  There  are  about  forty  houses,  almost  all 
in  s'-jht  of  each  other,  and,  in  that  respect,  well  situated  for  defence." 

In  1660,  Mademoiselle  Mance  asked  M.  de  Maisonneuve  for  permission  to  build  a 
stone  barn  of  sixty  by  thirty  feet  in  the  interior  of  the  fort,  to  guard  the  crops.  At 
this  time  the  Iroquois  were  very  formidable,  making  frequent  raids,  as  if  they  had 
resolved  on  the  extermination  of  the  French.  Nevertheless,  so  watchful  was  the 
governor  and  so  well-laid  were  his  plans,  that  very  few  of  the  fixrmers  fell  victims  to 
their  attacks.  Considerable  progress  had  already  been  made  in  the  establishment  of 
Domaines  and  seigneuries  around  the  city,  which  also  served  as  vanguards  for  its 
defence.  On  the  River  St.  Pierre  was  a  fief  of  three  hundred  arpents,  granted  to 
Major  Dupuy  (whose  family  is  still  represented  in  the  country).  It  was  he  who  took 
Major  Closse's  place  in  the  task  of  defence  at  the  St.  Lambert  mill.  The  concession- 
naire  had  to  erect  a  redoubt  and  workmen's  buildings  on  his  land.  Several  fiefs  were 
also  distributed  on  the  left  bank  of  the  St.  Lawrence — that  of  Lachine  to  La  Salle  &gt;' 
that  of  Gentilly,  of  the  Courselles  islands  and  the  Bay  d'Urf(§,  so  called  from  Abb6 
d'Urf^,  the  missionary  there.     Towards  the  Lake  of  Two  Mountains  was  the  fief  of

Moisbriant,  and,  reliirning  I)y  the  north,  other  fiefs  granlcil  to  different  oflitcrs. 
Finally,  on  the  River  Des  Prairies,  there  were  two  fiefs  named  after  Messieurs  ,/e 
Corion  and  tie  Mere/,  given  to  those  orticers  for  the  protection  of  the  island  on  that 
side,  and  to  prevent  the  savages  that  came  by  L'Assom|)tioii  River  from  landing. 

In  succeeding  years  both  sides  of  the  river  became  occupied.  M.  de  Laubia,  of 
the  de  Hroglie  regiment.,  obtained  two  leagues  of  front  and  depth  nn  Lake  St.  Peter ; 
his  sergeant,  f.abadie,  the  neighboring  district;  and  Sieur  de  Moras,  the  island  at  the 
mouth  of  Nicolet  River.  M.  de  Normanville  was  given  land  nearer  Montreal. 
Seigneuries  were  constituted  at  La  Valtrie,  de  Repentigny,  de  Uerthelot,  as  rewards  to 
otificers  in  the  employ  of  (lovernment.  Tint  was  to  fortify  the  north  side.  On  tlie 
south,  defence  was  still  more  needed  on  account  of  the  Iropiois,  wlio  wore  constantly 
descending  the  Richelieu  to  attack  (Quebec,  Montreal  and  Three  Rivers.  I,irge 
concessions  for  that  purpose  were  mide  to  .M.  de  Bsrthior,  captain  in  the  Carign^n 
regiment— the  land  opi):)iite  the  Richeliei-  which  still  bjars  Iiis  nam.-,  b.'ing  the  por- 
tion allotted  to  him;  while  to  M.  du  Pas  was  granted  the  island  still  so  called.  To 
M.  de  Sorel  was  conceded  all  the  land  on  both  sides  of  the  Richelieu  for  two  leagues 
in  dei)lh;  the  rest  of  the  river  land  being  given  to  Messieurs  St.  Ours— one  a  captain, 
the  other  an  ensign  of  the  Carignan  regiment.  .M.  de  Chambly  received  the  fort  of 
St.  Louis  and  all  the  lafids  adjacent,  and  lands  were  also  given  If)  Messieurs  de  Contre- 
canir,  de  Varennes,  de  Hoi.sbriant,  Boucher  de  Boucherville,  etc. 

M.  Charles  I,e  Moyne  received  lands  situateil  between  the  Seigneurie  of  M.  de 
Boucher  and  the  .Seigneurie  of  La  Prairie,  granted  to  the  Jesuit  Fathers.  The  name 
of  Longueuil  was  given  it  from  the  name  of  a  seigneurie  near  l)ie|)pe.  Beyond  La 
Prairie  he  obtained  a  large  grant  which  ne  called  Ciiateauguay,  a  name  whicii  it  still 
bears.  .Ml  these  tiefs  were  settled  by  soldiers  belonging  to  the  companies  of  the  otlicors 
who  obtained  them,  and  became  the  nuclei  of  towns  and  villages  of  importance,  such 
as  Sorel,  Chambly,  Berthier,  St.  Ours,  Contrecieur,  V'ercheres,  La  N'altrie,  Varennes, 
Boucherville,  Longueuil,  La  Prairie,  Chateauguay,  etc. 

Meanwhile,  as  the  surrounding  country  was  being  thus  partitioned,  and  what 
was  virtually  a  chain  of  garrisons  was  being  established  for  its  defence,  it  becanii 
necessary  to  draw  up  a  plan  of  the  city  itself,  for  the  guidance  of  those  erecting  build- 
ings. The  delicate  task  fell  to  i\L  DoUier  de  Casson,  superior  of  the  Seminary  of  St. 
Sulpice.     'Y\\'i proces-verhal^Axwwn  up  in  1672,  gives  the  following  particulars: — 

In  the  first  place,  M.  Dollier  de  Casson  traced  through  the  centre  of  Ville  Marie  a 
long  main  street,  to  which  he  gave  the  name  of  Notre  Dame,  in  honor  of  the  blessed 
patroness  of  the  city.  Parallel  thereto  he  drew  a  line,  to  which  he  gave  the  name  of 
St.  James  street,  in  honor  of  the  Rev.  Jacques  Olier,  with  whom  the  idea  of  the  colony 
originated.  On  the  other  side  of  Notre  Dame,  and  close  to  the  river,  stretched  St. 
Paul  street,  so  named  from  the  founder  Paul  Chomedy  de  Maisonneuve.  At  right 
angles  to  these  three  principal  streets  extended  several  others — St.  Peter,  in  honor  of 
the  Prince  of  the  Apostles,  and  as  a  compliment  to  M.  de  Fancamp,  one  of  the  found- 
ers ;  St.  Fran(;ois,  in  honor  of  the  patron  saint  of  M.  Dollier  de  Casson  himself;  and 
St.  Joseph,  in  honor  of  the  pious  husband  of  the  Virgin  Mary.  St.  Lambert  was  the 
fourth  of  these  transverse  streets,  and  so  called  after  Captain  Lambert  Closse,  already 
mentioned,  lieutenantofM.de  M.xisonneave.  who  was  slain  in  an  encointer  with  the 
Iroquois.  Another  was  called  St.  Gabriel,  in  remembrance  of  M.  Ciabriel  de  Queylus 
and  M.  Gabriel  Souart,  his  successor.     The  street  called  St.  Jean  Biiptiste,  which

probably  dates  from  about  tlu*  same  lime,  was  at  once  a  mark  of  reverence  lo  Canada's 
jj'reat  patron  and  an  indication  of  esteem  toward  the  illustrious  Colbert  who  did  so 
much  for  the  colony.  Another  of  those  early  streets  was  named  St.  Charles  in  con- 
sideration of  M.  Charles  I,e  Moyne,  who  had  rendered  distinguished  services  to  the 
colony,  and  had  his  residence  on  the  site  of  the  present  Honsecours  market. 

Tiie  city  was  thus  for  the  most  part  an  elevated  jilateau,  in  the  shape  of  a  parallel- 
ogram of  about  a  mile  anil  a  half  long,  and  about  a-lhird  of  a  mile  in  breadth.  On 
the  one  side  it  hid  the  river  ;  while  the  rest  was  almost  encircled  by  a  deep  natural 
entrenchment,  through  which  flowed  a  stream,  that  em|)tied  itself  into  tiie  .St.  I,aw- 
rence,  and  was  susceptible,  if  necessary,  of  enlargement  for  defensive  purposes.  This 
stream  had  its  course  in  part  where  Craig  street  is  to-day. 


Montreal:   1642- 1891. 

The   Fort   constructed  by  M.  de   Maisonncuvc  was  mainly  of  wood.     Not  far 
bom  it  stood  the  f"irst  mill  used  by  the  colonists.     As  the   population  increased,  new 
structures  became  necessary,  and  before   the  close   of  the   17th    century    the  city 
between  Craig  street  and  the  river  had  taken  the  form  which  is  still  largely  preserved. 
Dalhousie  square  is  the  site  of  the  new  mill  and  battery  erected  about  1M2.    I'',arly  in 
the  18th  century  it  was  deemed  advisable  to  fortify  the  city  by  the  traditional  plan 
of  circumvalhuion,  and  300,000  livres  were  granted  for  the  purpose  by  the  King  of 
France — arrangements   being,  however,  made  for  the  gradual  payment  of  half  the 
amount  by  the  .Seigneurs  (the  Seminary)  and  inhabitants.     In  the  report  which  he 
forwarded  to  France  in  1717,  M.  Chaussegros  de  Lery,  to  whom  the  task  had  been 
entrusted,  described  Montreal  as  a  city  of  three-quarters  of  a  league  in  circumference, 
but  without  any  proper  protection,  the  old  enclosure  being  in  a  ruinous  condition. 
His   recommendation  was  to  erect  such  a  wall   as   would   be   capable  of  resisting 
Fnglisli  artillery.    The  revetment  must  be  at  least  three  feet  thick,  and  a  uitch  would 
also  be  necessary.     He  began  the  work  on  the  Lachine  Gate,  as  being  the  side  most 
exposed  to  attack.     Though  a  start  had  been  made  with  this  system  of  fortifications 
before  the  close  of  17  17,  nothing  of  much  importance  was  effected  until  17 21.     After 
that  date,  notwithstanding  occasional  interruptions  from  various  causes,  the  work  of 
strengthening  the  city  was  persevered  in  until  it  was  a  /ait  accompli.     Fortification 
lane  is  an  extant  memorial  of  the  Montreal  of  the  great  wars  of  the  i8th  century. 
Although  the    testimony  of  travellers   and  the  opinion  of  experts  leave   the  una- 
voidable impression  that  Montreal,  as  fortified  by  Chaussegros  de  Lery's  plans,  was  a 
city  of  considerable  strength,  its  defences  proved  of  little  avail  in  the  hour  of  trial. 
On  the  8th  of  September,  1760,  it  passed  quietly  into  the  hands  of  the  British,  and  a 
few  years  later  English  merchants  were  doing  business  within  its  limits  as  though  it 
had  never  changed  its  allegiance. 

The  hundred  and  eighteen  years  that  elapsed  between  the  arrival  of  De  Maison- 
neuve  and  the  capitulation  of  the  city  to  General  Amherst,  were  in  many  ways  event- 
ful. About  half  this  period  might  be  assigned  as  the  heroic  age  of  Montreal.  It 
comprises  the  early  struggles  with  the  insidious  Iroquois,  the  story  of  Bollard's 
devotion,  of  the  dreadful  massacre  of  Lachine,  of  the  inception  of  those  daring  enter- 
prises of  exploration  which  were  ultimately  to  find  their  diverse  goals  in  the  Pacific,

the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  the  Arctic  Ocean.  Tlien,  too,  were  initiated  those  great 
religious,  educational  and  charitable  projects,  the  memory  of  which  is  cherished  in 
many  a  hallowed  spot  within  and  without  the  line  of  the  ancient  walls.  Then,  too, 
was  begun  the  crusade  against  intemperance  among  the  Indians  and  that  traffic 
which  madeliicm  fiends,  while  zealous  priests  were  striving  to  make  them  Christians. 
It  was  also  the  age  of  the  coureurs  des  bois,  the  bushrangers,  whose  exploits  are  so 
romantic  to  read  about,  thougii  they  caused  sorrow  to  many  a  home  and  were  tlie 
object  of  many  a  weighty  censure  from  the  Church. 

By  the  close  of  the  17th  century  a  marked  change  began  to  be  observable  in  the 
social,  industrial  and  commercial  conditions  of  the  city.  The  system  of  government 
was  already  established  and  justice  was  regularly  administered.  While  Colbert  was  in 
power,  earnest  efforts  had  been  made  to  promote  coloniz.vtion,  agriculture,  manufac- 
tures and  commerce,  and  although  in  1701  the  entire  population,  even  including 
Acadia,  did  not  reach  20,000  souls,  so  many  outposts  had  been  occupied  that  the 
possibilities  of  development  were  obvious  to  the  far-seeing  statesman.  Iron-works, 
tanneries,  shipbuilding,  and  other  industries  had  been  started,  and  there  was  a  con- 
siderable trade  with  the  Motiier  Country  and  the  West  Indies.  Montreal  had  a 
share  in  this  various  progress — small,  indeed,  compared  with  its  relative  rank  as  a 
centre  of  business  in  later  generations,  but  still  sufficient  to  indicate  what,  under 
favorable  cirf^umstances,  it  was  destined  to  become. 

The  erection  of  the  improved  fortitications.  the  nature  and  extent  of  which 
have  just  been  outlined,  show  to  what  degree  the  authorities  had  recognized  its  advan- 
tages. Though  Quebec,  in  point  of  population,  and  as  the  metropolis  and  chief 
garrison  of  the  colony,  as  well  as  from  its  readier  access  to  visitors  from  Europe,  took 
precedence  during  the  whole  period  of  French  rule,  an  J  for  a  considerable  tim;  after 
the  Cession,  the  situation  of  Montreal  clearly  pointed  it  out  as  the  great  entrepot 
between  the  East  and  West.  In  that  sense,  the  naming  of  Lachine  (China)  was  one 
of  those  unconscious  prophecies  which  are  sometimes  met  with  in  the  pages  of  history. 

At  the  time  of  its  occupation  by  the  British  forces  it  contained  thirty-two  streets 
and  four  hnes.  Notre  Dame  street  was  then  the  aristocratic  quarter.  The  parish 
church  marked  its  centre.  The  Court  house  and  civic  of!ices  were  nearly  opposite 
the  Seminary,  at  the  corner  of  St.Frangois  Xavier  street.  The  Jesuits'  establishment 
was  nearly  on  the  site  of  the  present  Court  house.  The  old  Bonsecours  Church, 
which  had  been  burned  in  1754,  had  not  yet  been  replaced  by  the  new  one  erected 
in  1771-73.  The  Recollet  church,  with  the  adjoining  monastery  and  garden,  was  con- 
spicuous in  the  area  between  Lemoine  and  Notre  Dame  streets, — the  intervening 
Recollet  street  bearing  witness  to  the  fact.  The  citadel  stood  on  Dalhousie  square. 
Not  far  off  a  po'tion  of  M.  de  Lery's  walls  remained  standing  until  1881,  when  it  was 
removed  to  make  room  for  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  Station.  The  Chateau  de 
Raniezay,  now  occupied  by  Laval  University,  is  one  of  the  most  remarkable  relics 
of  old  Montreal.  It  was  built  as  long  ago  as  1704,  and  was  long  the  centre  of  fashion 
and  official  distinction  under  the  aicien  regime.  It  is  also  noteworthy  as  having 
shelter:^d  Benjamin  Franklin,  Samuel  Chase  and  Charles  Carroll  of  CarroUtown,  when 
these  celebrated  men  came  here  as  emissaries  from  Congress  to  allure  the  Canadians 
from  their  allegiance  to  King  George . 

Montreal  owes  its  present  architectural  splendor  very  largely  to  devastating  fires. 
Both  before  and  after  the  capitulation,  it  was  often  the  scene   of  holocausts    that

attracted  attention  in  Europe  as  well  as  on  this  Continent.  In  1765  a  great  ])art  of  it 
fell  a  prey  to  the  flames,  owing  to  the  greed  and  carelessness  of  one  Livingston.  Jonas 
Hanway,  the  philanthropist,  headed  a  subscription  in  England  for  the  relief  of  the 
sufferers.  A  more  handsomd  and  flourishing  city  rose  above  the  ruins  of  the  destroyed 
buildings.  Three  years  later,  another  fire  swept  away  a  hundred  houses,  and 
before  the  new  rijime  had  lasted  for  a  quarter  of  a  century,  the  apjiearance  of  Mont- 
real had  been  materially  transformed.  The  year  1774  is  a  critical  year  in  the  history  of 
Canada  and  of  all  North  America.  It  worked  the  inception  of  a  new  era — that  of  the 
Quebec  Act,  which  assured  to  the  King's  new  subjects  the  free  exercise  of  their  religion 
and  the  practice  of  their  civil  law,  and  also  created  a  legislative  council.  It  had  hardly 
gone  into  force  when  Montreal  was  occupied  by  the  invading  army  of  Congress.  On 
tlie  i2th  of  November,  1775,  the  citizens  saw  the  alien  foe  approaching  their  gates,  and 
as  no  resistance  was  possible,  Montgomery  and  his  troojis  were  admitted  on  the 
following  day.  On  the  departure  of  that  officer  for  Quebec,  where  he  was  repulsed  and 
met  his  death,  VVooster,  who  had  been  left  in  com  nand  at  Montreal,  subjected  the 
inhabitants  to  vexatious  petty  tyrannies,  from  which  they  were  glad  to  be  delivered  in 
the  ensuing  summer.  The  presence  of  the  Americans  in  the  city  had  one  important 
result — the  foundation  of  a  newspaper,  the  Montreal  Gazette,  which  still  flourishes  after 
a  hundred  and  twelve  y'^-.rs  of  existence.  The  idea  originated  with  Joseph  Fleury  de 
Mesplet,  whom  Franlvlin  had  brought  with  him  to  serve  as  an  intermediary  with  the 
French  Canadians,  and  who,  when  his  master's  mission  failed,  cast  in  his  lot  with  the 
people  whom  he  could  not  convert.  The  American  Re\'olution  had  grave  conse- 
quences in  which  Montreal  shared  to  some  extent.  It  caused  an  influx  of  many 
thousands  of  loyalists,  who,  having  lost  home  and  property  in  their  native  land,  were 
given  an  asylum  in  Canada,  to  which  their  advent  brought  a  material  increase  of 
[lopulation.  Most  of  them  settled  in  Western  Canada  and  the  Maritime  Provinces, 
but  a  considerable  proportion  chose  the  Quebec  and  Montreal  districts  for  their  per- 
manent residence.  In  1791  the  province  of  Quebec  was  divided  by  the  Constitutional 
Act  into  Upper  and  Lower  Canada,  each  with  its  own  legislature. 

In  the  following  year  the  bounds  of  the  city  underwent  considerable  enlarge- 
ment. In  population  it  had  already  taken  precedence  of  all  other  cities  in  Canada. 
Beyond  the  walls  towards  the  mountain  there  was  a  considerable  number  of  villas, 
with  spacious  gardens  and  orchards.  The  seigneurs  and  other  gentry  had  capacious 
stone-built  houses,  and  how  well  the  merchant  i)rinces  of  those  days  lived  and  fared  we 
know  from  abundant  testimony  of  travellers.  Some  of  the  wealthiest  of  them  were  Nor'- 
Westers.  "  Our  dinner,"  writes  a  guest  of  one  of  these  magnates,  "  was  excellent, 
served  in  sumptuous  style.  We  had  soup,  salmon,  roast  beef  and  mutton,  geese,  ducks, 
and  pigeons,  plum  pudding,  pies  and  tarts,  biscuits  and  butter,  brought  from  the  Grand 
Portage  at  the  head  of  Lake  Superior,  several  kinds  of  English  cheese,  and  a  dessert  of 
various  kinds  of  foreign  and  domestic  fruit.  Our  liquors  were  London  i)orter, 
bottled  cider,  strong  ale,  Madeira,  port,  claret  and  Champagne  wines."  The  same 
writer  refers  to  his  host's  "extensive  and  well-managed  garden,  in  which  were  not  only 
to  be  seen  all  the  plants  usually  found  in  gardens  here,  but  many  exotics.  Those  of 
milder  climates  are  preserved  in  a  green  house.  Peach  and  other  fruit  tree;i  are 
protected  from  the  rigor  of  winter  by  a  wall."  Belonging  to  the  same  establishment 
was  "an  aviary  well  stocked,  as  also  deer,  rabbii  J  and  other  animals  tamed,  with 
many  curiosities  in  and  about  the  house,  which  render  it  an  interesting  place  to  an

inquisitive  mind."  Of  the  prospect  from  the  mountain  he  writes  that  it  is  "  exceed- 
ingly picturesque  and  grand,"  and  that  "  luxuriant  and  well  cultivated  fields  extend 
to  the  city." 

Testimony  of  this  kind  to  the  social  habits  of  welKlo-do  people  in  Montreal  a 
hundred  years  ago  could  be  multiplied  from  the  works  of  travellers.  Nor  are  we 
without  indications  of  other  phases  of  life  at  that  period.  In  1783  a  lottery  was 
established  for  the  jjurpose  of  raising  money  to  build  a  new  gaol — the  tickets  being  sold 
for  46s.  8d..  and  the  prizes  ranging  from  £S  53.  to  £4.  The  magistrates  issued  strict 
injunctions  for  keeping  the  streets  in  order.  Every  householder  had  to  keep  "free 
from  filtli,  mud,  dirt,  rubbish,  straw  or  hay  "  one-half  of  the  street  opposite  his  own 
house.  The  '■'  cleanings  "  were  to  be  deposited  on  the  beach.  Stray  pigs  could  be  kept 
by  the  finder,  if  no  one  turned  up  to  claim  them  in  twenty-four  hours,  and,  on  mak- 
ing himself  known,  the  owner  had  to  pay  a  fine  of  los.  For  a  stray  horse  the  penalty 
was  5s.  The  carters  were  obliged  to  keeji  the  markets  clean.  The  regulations  for 
vehicles,  slaughter-houses,  side-walks,  etc.,  were  equally  strict.  Keepers  of  inns 
and  taverns  had  to  light  the  streets.  Every  one  entering  the  town  in  a  sleigh  had 
to  carry  a  shovel  with  him  to  level  the  cahots  at  any  distance  within  three  leagues  of 
the  city  limits.  The  rates  for  cabs  and  ferry-boats  were  fixed  with  much  precision. 
No  carter  was  allowed  to  plead  a  prior  engagement,  but  had  to  go  with  the  person 
who  first  asked  him,  under  a  penalty  of  twenty  shillings. 

Opi)ortunities  for  intellectual  improvement  were  not  wanting.  Montreal  had  a 
public  library  before  the  i8th  century  came  to  an  end,  and  some  of  the  books 
that  formed  part  of  it  may  still  be  seen  in  the  Eraser  Institute. 

Reference  has  already  been  made  to  the  extensive  fires  which,  at  successive 
epochs,  swept  so  much  of  old  Montreal  out  of  existence,  and  thus  furnished  an  oppor- 
tunity of  building  a  better  class  of  houses  on  the  devastated  areas.  On  the  26th  of 
January,  1819,  a  great  fire  broke  out  in  a  store-house  of  pork  belonging  to  Mr. 
D.  W.  Eager,  and  situated  near  the  site  of  the  present  Custom  house.  When  the 
fire  brigade  (then  a  volunteer  body)  arrived  on  the  spot,  the  flames  had  gained  the 
mastery  of  the  upper  i)nrt  of  the  building,  and  all  efforts  to  save  it  were  paralyzed  for 
want  of  water.  It  was  impossible  to  break  the  thick  ice  on  the  river  in  time  to  be  of 
any  service,  and  so,  though  there  was  a  multitude  of  willing  helpers  on  the  spot,  they 
could  render  no  effectual  aid.  Just  then  the  happy  thought  occurred  to  Mr.  Corse  to 
attack  the  destroyer  with  snowballs.  No  sooner  said  than  done.  In  five  minutes 
a  perfect  fusillade  from  hundreds  of  brawny  arms  had  smothered  the  fire  with  snow, 
which,  melting,  extinguished  the  flames.  In  that  way  some  800  barrels  of  pork  were 
saved  from  premature  and  i)rofitless  consumption.  Already  steps  had  been  taken  to 
remedy  the  great  inconvenience  consequent  on  a  deficient  supi^ly  of  water,  and  in 
April,  1 801,  an  act  was  passed  by  the  Legislature,  constituting  Joseph  Frobisher  and 
others  a  company,  which  bore  the  name  of  "  Proprietors  of  the  Montreal  Water 
Works."  It  was  the  starting  point  of  the  grand  organization  which  still  bears  that 
name. 

As  has  already  been  mentioned,  it  was  not  long  after  the  foundation  of  the  city 
that  attention  was  called,  in  a  very  practical  manner,  to  its  liability  to  devastating 
floods.  But  although  from  time  to  time  the  city  suffered  materially  from  this  source, 
it  wasnotvuitil  recently  that  decisive  and  effective  protective  measures  were  determined 
on.    This  subject  is  closely  connected  with  that  of  harbor  improvement  and  the  removal

of  obstructions  to  navigation  in  Lake  St.  Peter  channel.  With  these  developments 
the  commercial  growth  of  Montreal  has  been  intimately  associated.  No  city  in  the 
world  has  proved  more  alive  to  all  the  great  advances  in  every  department  of  com- 
merce consequent  on  the  application  of  steam  to  the  movement  of  vessels.  The 
first  attempt  to  utilize  the  discovery  on  our  great  central  waterway  was  made  in  1809 
by  the  late  Hon.  John  Molson.  More  th  .orty  years  intervened  between  that  exper- 
iment and  the  establishment  of  a  line  of  steamships  to  effect  regular  communication 
with  Europe.  Once  this  latter  enterprise  was  fairly  launched,  the  progress  achieved 
was  remarkable,  and  to-day  Montreal's  great  ocean  lines  are  among  the  finest, 
best  equipped  and  most  trustworthy  in  the  world.  Still  more  signal  has  been  the 
extension  of  Montreal's  opportunities  for  intercourse  by  means  of  railways  with  the 
rest  of  the  world.  Only  those  who  can  recall  the  day  of  small  things,  and  can  follow 
stage  by  stage  in  their  memories  the  successive  triumphs  of  the  last  half  century,  can 
realize  what  in  this  direction  have  been  the  gains  of  Montreal.  The  opening  of  the 
St.  Lawrence  and  Atlantic  road  in  1851,  for  a  distance  of  less  than  a  hundred  miles, 
was  deemed  an  event  of  sufficient  importance  to  justify  the  rejoicings  of  the  entire 
community-  In  1891,  there  is  no  point  from  the  Rlastern  to  the  Western  ocean,  or 
from  the  sub-arctic  north  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  with  which  the  city  is  not  in  com- 
munication, while  mercantile  fleets  have  placed  it  in  com&gt;''arative  proximity  to  the 
very  "ends  of  the  earth."  In  solidity  and  beauty,  in  all  ll  laUes  a  great  business 
centre  an  enjoyable  dwelling-place,  Montreal  has  at  the  same  time  been  making  wel- 
come progress.  The  cemeteries,  which  were  once  witiiin  the  city  limits,  are  now  soine 
miles  beyond  it,  and  are  laid  out  with  a  skill  and  taste  which  rob  them  of  all  but  the 
tenderest  associations.  In  their  stead,  gardens  and  squares  afford  pleasure  grounds 
and  breathing  si)aces  to  the  inhabitants,  while  the  Island  and  Mountain  Parks  are 
among  the  most  deservedly  admired  of  such  attractive  areas  on  this  continent.  At 
this  moment  a  scheme  of  street  enlargement  and  multifarious  improvement  is  in 
course  of  being  carried  out,  which,  when  completed,  will  make  Montreal  second,  for 
architectural  splendor  and  broad,  well  paved  thoroughfares,  to  no  city  in  the  world. 
The  suburbs  are  gradually  embracing  the  most  picturesque  and  desirable  portions  of 
the  island,  within  a  circuit  of  from  five  to  seven  miles,  ard  ultimately,  doubtless,  the 
entire  insular  domain  for  which,  in  olden  timc'^,  the  Superiors  of  Saint  Sulpice  ren- 
dered homage,  will  be  conterminous  with  the  city. 

To  attempt,  in  this  brief  survey,  to  descrii)e  any  of  Montreal's  great  edifices 
would  be  vain,  as  to  comprehend  them  all  would  be  impossible,  and  to  particularize 
a  few  where  so  luany  aie  deserving  of  praise  would  be  invidious.  The  Roman 
Catholic  institutions  of  the  city  would  require  a  volume  rather  than  a  sketch  for 
worthy  treatment,  while  the  later  Protestant  churches,  colleges,  schools  and  houses 
of  charity  would  demand  no  less  attention.  Notre  Dame,  Our  Lady  of  Lourdes, 
the  Grey  Nuns'  Convent,  St.  Peter's,  the  Seminary,  the  Hotel-Dieu,  the  Gesu,  among 
the  former,  and  the  Anglican  Cathedral,  St.  James  the  Apostle,  St.  Paul's,  St.  James 
Methodist  Church,  McGiU  College,  the  Mackay  Institute  for  Deaf-Mutes,  and  the 
General  Hospital,  among  the  latter,  are  among  the  edifices  which  will  repay  inspection. 
Mention  has  already  been  made  of  the  Bonsecours  Church.  As  holding  the  same 
venerable  repute  among  Protestant  places  of  worship,  the  St.  Gabriel  Street  (Kirk 
of  Scotland)  church  (now  disused  for  congregational  purposes)  ought  not  to  be  for- 
gotten.    The  history  of  old  St.  Gabriel,  by  the  Rev.  Robert  Cainpbell,  is,  moreover, 


42 


Montreal:  1642-1891. 


a  thesaurus  of  manifold  information,  touching  the  early  religious  and  social  history 
of  the  English-speaking  section  of  the  population.  The  records  of  education  in 
Montreal  cover  nearly  a  quarter  of  a  millennium  ;  the  history  of  public  instruction, 
as  a.  department  of  state  administration,  is,  however,  confined  within  half  a  century. 
It  has  been  a  time  of  progress  in  which  all  the  inhabitants  have  shared,  and  a  visit  to 
the  handsome  school  buildings  erected  by  the  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant 
Commissioners,  as  well  as  to  the  Normal  Schools  (Jacques  Cartier  and  McGill)  for 
the  training  of  teachers,  not  to  speak  of  special  institutions  (as  the  Ecole  Poly- 
technique,  etc.),  will  show  that  Montreal  does  not  in  this  phase  of  development  lag 
behind  the  other  great  cities  of  the  world. 

There  is  one  cluster  of  buildings  to  which  the  eye  of  the  stranger  on  his  way 
round  or  up  the  mountain  is  sure  to  be  attracted, — those  which  were  erected  in 
view  of  a  regular  annual  exhibition.  For  a  number  of  years,  while  its  facilitiv  ^  were 
much  less  perfect  than  they  are  to-day  for  such  a  purpose,  Montreal  had  its  yearly 
industrial  and  agricultural  fair.  Through  whatever  cause  or  causes  the  interruption 
occurred,  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  the  efforts  recently  made  to  revive  this  important 
institution  will  prove  successful.  More  especially  is  it  to  be  hoped  that  the  year 
1892,  in  which  Montreal  will  have  completd  a  quarter  of  a  millennium  of  history  as 
habitation  of  civilized  people,  will  not  be  allowed  to  pass  without  worthy  recognition. 

The  Government  of  Montreal  has  undergone  frequent  changes.  Under  the  Old 
Regime  it  was  placed  in  charge  of  governors,  some  of  whom  asserted,  if  they  did 
not  succeed  in  exercising,  a  certain  independence.  The  following  is  a  list  of  these 
functionaries  from  1642  to  the  close  of  French  rule  : — 


Paul  de  Chomedey,  Sieur  de  Maisonneuve. 
Elienne  Pezard,  Sieur  de  La  Touclie. 
Zachaiie  Dupiiis. 
Dominique  de  Laniothe,  Sieur  de  Luciere 

et  de  Saint-Paul. 
Sieur  de  la  Fredi^re. 
Francois- Marie  Peiiot. 
F".  X.  Tarien  de  la  Naudi^re,  Sieur  de  la 

Perade. 
Henault  de  Rivaux. 


Louis  Hector  de  Calli^res. 
Philippe  de  Rigaud,  Marquis  de  Vaudreuil. 
Claude  de  Ramezay. 

Charles  LeMoyne,  1st  Baron  de  Longueuil. 
Jean  Uouillet  de  la  Chassaigne. 
Dubois  Berthelot,  Chevalier  de  Beaucourt. 
J.  h.  Roch  de  Ramezay,  Charles  LeMoyne, 
3rd  Haion  de  Longueuil, 

Pierre  de  Rigaud  de  Vaudreuil,  brother  of 
the  Governor-General,* 


The  system  of  local  governors  was  continued  for  some  years  after  the  establish- 
ment of  British  rule,  Brigadier-General  Gage  being  appointed  by  His  Excellency, 
General  Murray,  as  first  English  governor  of  Montreal  and  the  surrounding  district. 
He  was  succeeded  by  Col.  Burton.  In  1764,  Civil  Government  succeeded  to  the 
Hegitite  Militaire,  and  Courts  of  Justice  were  established  to  sit  regularly.  The  trial 
of  the  persons  accused  of  attempting  to  assassmate  Mr.  Thomas  Walker,  one  of  His 
Majesty's  Justices  of  the  Peace  for  the  Montreal  District,  in  December  of  that  year, 
the  documents  of  which  have  been  preserved  among  our  archives,  lets  in  considerable 
light  on  the  political  and  social  condition  of  Montreal  at  that  early  period  ol  British 
adminihtration.  From  lists  prepared  by  Governor  Murray,  registers  of  births, 
marriages  and  deaths  by  Anglican  clergymen,  the  napies  of  jurors  and  signers  of

petitions  and  other  sources  of  knowledge,  it  is  evident  that  soon  after  the  capitulation 
of  the  city  there  must  have  been  a  considerable  influx  of  British  subjects  from  the 
other  colonies  and  from  the  Mother  Country.  In  these  documents,  moreover,  are 
found  ihe  names  of  several  persons  who  were  destined  to  rise  to  positions  of  influence 
in  later  years.  Early  numbers  of  the  Quebec  and  Montreal  Gazettes  convey  a  good 
deal  of  interesting  information,  regarding  the  course  of  events  from  the  inception  of 
Civil  Government  till  the  division  of  the  province  into  Upper  and  Lower  Canada. 

*  From  the  year  1796  to  the  year  1833,  the  municipal  affairs  of  Montreal  were 
administered  by  Justices  of  the  Peace  sitting  in  special  sessions  for  that  purpose.  In 
1832  the  city  was  incorporated  (ist  William  IV.,  chap.  59),  and  to  that  end  was 
divided  into  eight  wards  :  East,  VVeit,  St.  Ann,  St.  Joseph,  St.  Anioine,  St.  Lawrence, 
St.  Louis  and  St.  Mary.  The  first  meeting  of  the  Corporation  was  held  on  the  5th  of 
June,  1833.  On  that  0',v;asion  Jacques  Viger,  Esquire,  was  elected  mayor,  an  office 
which  he  continued  to  hold  until  the  new  incorporation  of  1840.  The  Corporation  of 
1840  was  appointed  by  the  Governor-General  for  a  term  which  was  to  expire  in 
December,  1842.     Their  successors  were  to  be  elected  by  the  people. 

From  1840  till  1852,  the  mayors  were  (with  the  exception  of  the  Hon.  Mr; 
McGill  in  1840)  chosen  by  the  Council.  By  the  Act  14  and  15  Vic,  cip.  128,  passed 
on  the  31st  of  August,  185 1,  the  election  of  the  city's  chief  magistrate  was  committed 
to  the  citizens.

I'RIEF    BIBLIOGRAPHY    OF    M()NTRP:AI.. 


For  the  beiufil  cf  those  who  wish  to  emer  into  a  minute  study  of  the  history  of 
Montreal,  it  has  been  thought  well  to  append  to  thi,s  sketch  a  brief  bibliography  of 
the  subject.  Like  all  bibliographies,  it  is  only  tentative.  It  has  not  been  thought 
necessary  to  include  histories  of  Canada,  and  other  works,  of  which  the  authors  of 
the  books  cited  must  have  availed  tliemselves.  P'or  information  as  to  the  industrial 
and  commercial  development  of  Montreal,  especially  in  recent  years,  many  pub- 
lications of  a  special  character  (such  as  Board  of  Trade  Reports,  etc.)  would  have 
to  be  ccnsulted,  while  many  excellent  articles  as  to  other 'phases  of  its  progress 
are  to  be  found  in  the  contributions  to  periodicals  and  newspapers.

Montreal  is  the  commercial  Capital  of  Canada  and  the  most  populous  City  (^211,302)  of  the 
Dominion.  It  is  situated  at  the  head  of  Sea  or  outward  Navigation,  and  at  the  foot  of  the  great  chain 
of  River,  Lake  and  Canal  Navigation  which  extends  westward  to  Kingston,  Toronto,  Hamilton, 
Niagara,  Buffalo,  Detroi:,  Chicago  and  Duluth,  embracing  an  almost  unequalled  extent  of  inland 
water  communication.  It  occupies  one  of  the  most  commanding  positions  in  the  Dominion,  and 
it  is  on  a  large  fertile  and  beautiful  island  of  the  same  name,  30  miles  in  length  by  10  miles  of 
extreme  breadth,  formed  by  the  confluence  of  the  Ottawa  and  St.  Lawrence  Rivers,  and  on  the 
north  bank  of  the  latter,  thus  situated  near  the  junction  of  two  important  rivers,  with  a  free 
communication  seawards,  though  70  miles  above  the  influence  of  the  tides,  and  300  miles  from 
saltwater.  Montreal  possesses  all  the  advantages  of  both  an  inland  city  and  a  seaport,  accessible 
to  seagoing  steamships  of  over  5000  tons  burthen.  Holding,  too,  as  it  were,  the  navigation 
of  the  Canals  and  Lakes  of  the  V/es!,  of  the  far  west,  makes  it  the  greater  centre  of  attraction  and 
the  Commercial  Emporium  of  the  Dominion.  The  City  is  the  chief  seat  of  manufacturing  operations 
in  costly  establshinints,  the  prodiictioa?  of  which  will  compare  favorably  with  those  of  other 
cities.     Among  the  daily  increasing  and  prosperous  undertakings  are  : 

227  factories,  employing  2996  hands  ;  36  foundries,  employing  1028  hands  ;  77  manufactories, 
employing  1(184  hands  ;  43  mills,  employing  757  hands.  Other  branches  will  be  given  in  this  Re[K)rt, 
It  may  be  stated  that  an  average  of  107  Railw.ny  Passenger  cars,  28  Sleepers,  720  Freight  and 
Cattle  cars,  arrive  daily  at  the  several  railw.ny  stations. 

During  navigation  624  Ocean  Sleanishi|is  arrived  in  the  Port  of  Montreal,  the  arrivals  for  last 
season  being  746.  During  same  season  252  tiulf  and  River  Steamers  and  5,162  Inland  craft,  having 
966,959  tons  burthen,  arrived  iii  Port ;  also  122  sailing  ships,  barques,  brigs,  brigantines  and  schooners 
arrived  in  Port  of  Montreal,  from  the  Atlantic  Ocean. 

The  wharves  are  on  tiie  eve  of  extensive  and  wonderful  ameliorations  to  meet  urgent  business 
demands.    The  City  and  suburbs  are  fully  and  beautifully  lit  with  gas  and  numerous  electric  lights. 

Peace,  happiness  and  prosperity  abound,  and  brotherly  love  forms  a  link  that  might  be  prized  in 
any  city.     The  policeman  is  seldom  needed.     Intemperance  is  becoming  a  thing  of  the  past. 

Montreal  has  magnificent  Water  Works.  The  water  is  taken  from  the  St  Lawrence,  a  mile  and 
a  half  above  the  Lachine  Rapids,  and  conducted  a  distance  of  five  miles  through  an  open  canal  to  a 
spacious  basin,  where  it  is,  by  powerful  and  costly  machinery,  forced  up  through  the  pumping  msin 
two  miles  and  three-quarters  in  length,  to  reservoirs  on  the  brow  of  the  Mountain,  capable  o^'  con., 
taining  fifteen  million  gallons.  This  great  work  was  undertaken  and  successfully  completed  by  our 
eminent  Civil  Engineer,  Thomas  C.  Keei-^er.  Everything  connected  with  it  is  kept  in  admiMble 
order.  Our  active  firemen  can  always  depend  on  the  extensive  mains  for  a  plentiful  supply,  which 
enables  them  to  combat  successfully  and  speedily  accidental  fires. 

Our  "Father  of  Waters,"  the  St  Lawrence,  is  spanned  by  the  Victoria  Bridge,  the  most  costly 
and  magnificent  work  of  the  kind  ever  erected,  with  its  two  long  abutments  and  twenty-four  piers  of 
solid  masonry  ;  this  great  tubular  bridge  of  iron  stands  a  monument  of  engineering  skill,  and  places 
the  name  of  its  eminent  engineer,  Robert  Stephenson,  foremost  in  the  ranks  of  Civil  Engineers, 
The  total  length  of  th""  bridge  is  9,184  lineal  feet,  with  24  sjians  of  242  feet  each,  and  one  (the  central 
tube,  which  is  60  feet  above  highwater)  of  330  feet.  The  first  stone  of  this  great  work  was  laid  on 
the  20th  July,  1854,  and  the  first  passenger  train  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway  Company  passed 
through  it  on  the  17th  December,  1859,  The  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  Bridge  at  Lachine  is  another 
connecting  link  between  Montreal  and  the  South  shore.  It  connects  the  Pacific  system  with  the  Eastern 
States,  with  connections  to  the  sea  by  way  of  Halifax  and  St  John.  These  great  enterprises  and 
similar  undertakings  have  placed  Canada  in  a  proud  and  prosperous  position  before  our  lieloved 
Mother  Country  and  the  outside  world. 

Montreal  has  51  avenues,  2  hills,  41  lanes,  2  parks,  5  places,  4  roads,  1  row,  12  squares,  381  streets, 
3  terraces,  i  track  ;  34,455  houses  :  25,774  brick,  81  dashed,  5482  stone,  3118  wooden.

KINDLY    FURNISHED   BY   WILLIAM   ROBB,   ESQ.,   CITY   TREASURER. 

The  City  of  Montreal  was  incorporated  in  1832.  It  embraces  an  area  of  about  6,000  acres, 
divided  into  13  wards,  each  returning  three  members  to  the  City  Council.  The  Mayor  is  elected  by 
the  suffrages  of  the  citizens  generally  ;  and  the  terms  of  office  are  one  year  for  the  Mayoralty  and 
three  years  for  the  Aldermen  (one  for  each  ward  retiring  annually). 

The  assessed  value  of  its  real  estate  approaches  $125,000,000,  of  which  over  $20,000,000  is 

exempted  under  the  following  heads  : — 

Ciovernment  property $3,000,000 

Municipal         "         5,000,000  1 

Benevolent  Institutions— Roman  Catholic 5,700,000  I 

Special  Business  exemptions  900,000  j 

The  valuations  are  made  annually  by  a  Board  of  Assessors,  who  visit  every  property  for  that 
purpose ;  and  while  the  law  directs  the  appraisement  to  be  made  at  the  actual  market  value,  it  is 
generally  conceded  to  average  about  twenty  per  cent,  under  actual  selling  prices. 

The  rate  of  annual  assessment  is  one  par  cent,  on  value,  with  an  additional  one  fifth  of  one  per  cent, 
for  School  Tax,  which  is  levied  and  collected  by  the  City  but  handed  over  to  the  .School  Commissioners, 
a  body  appointed  by  the  Local  Government  and  the  City  jointly,  for  administration.  In  addition  to  this 
one  and  one-fifth  per  cent,  on  Realty,  there  is  a  Water  Rate,  based  on  a  slidinc;  scale,  which  approximates 
7j  per  cent,  on  annual  rental  values,  and  an  assessment  of  seven  and  one-half  per  cent,  on  tiie  rental  of 
all  business  premises,  which  is  known  ,;s  the  "  Business  Tax,"  beside  specific  licences  on  certain  trades 
or  professions  and  the  usual  taxes  on  horses,  carriages,  dogs,  etc.,  which  come  under  the  head  of 
"Personal  Taxes."  The  City  also  derives  a  considerable  revenue  from  its  Markets,  and  from  |)enalties 
imposed  by  the  Recorder's  Court.  Street  improvements  are  paid  for  by  assessments  on  the  parlies 
benefitted,  as  determined  by  Commissioners  appointed  by  the  Courts  ;  except  in  special  cases  where 
the  City  bears  a  portion  of  the  expense.  Drains  are  charged  against  the  properties  which  they  pass 
(^  on  each  side),  with  the  exception  of  main  sewers,  of  which  the  greater  part  of  the  cost  is  defrayed 
from  the  general  funds  of  the  City :  abutting  properties  being  charged  the  proportion  of  a  small  sewer 
only. 

The  present  revenue  from  all  sources  is  about  $2,225,000,  and  the  following  figures  will  illustrate 
the  more  recent  progress  of  the  City  : 


Gross  Revenue  of  1875 $1,335,000

The  annual  appropriations  for  the  administr.-ilion  of  the  City's  affairs  are  based  on  the  actual 
receipts  of  each  preceding  year  ;  five  per  cent,  being  reserved  for  unforeseen  expenditure.  Provision  for 
the  interest  on  its  funded  debt  is  made,  by  law,  the  first  charge  on  its  revenue. 

The  debt  of  the  Cit;  which  is  limited  to  15  per  cent,  of  the  assessed  value  of  its  Real  Estate,  is  now 
about  $16,000,000,  of  which  more  than  one-half  is  represented  by  bond  fide  assets  in  the  shape  of  Water 
Works,  Markets,  Fire  and  Police  Stations,  City  Hall,  etc.,  which  yield  a  revenue,  directly  or  indi- 
rectly, equal  to  the  interest  on  that  portion  of  the  debt ;  while  its  Parks,  though  non-revenue 
producing,  are  none  the  less  bond  fide  assets  of  immense  and  ever-increasing  value. 

The  credit  of  the  City  stands  so  high  that  it  has  been  able  to  float  its  loans  on  the  London  money 
markets  at  prices  comparing  favorably  with  Government  securities  ;  and  at  the  present  day  it  is  obtain- 
ing funds  for  its  permanent  improvements  on  inscribed,  transferable  stock  at  an  interest  cost  of  less 
than  3i  per  cent,  per  annum. 


PORT   OF   MONTREAL   UP    TO    FALL   OF    1890. 

WRITTEN    EXPRESSLY   FOR   LOVBLL'S  HISTORIC    REPORT   OP  CENSUS  OF   MONTREAL, 

BY  PETER  CROSSBV. 

In  order  justly  to  appreciate  the  present  importance  of  the  Port  ok  Montreal,  it  is  necessary  to 
consider  from  what  a  small  beginning,  and  with  what  rapid  strides,  Montreal  has  risen  to  its  present 
rank  amongst  the  Cities  of  the  World. 

According  to  Garneau's  History  of  Canada,  there  were  only  584  persons  in  Montreal  in  the  year 
1666  ;  and  in  1734  the  whole  population  of  Canada,  of  European  descent,  amounted  to  37,633  souls  ;  but, 
in  1851,  there  were,  according  to  tiie  Census  of  that  year,  57,715  souls  in  Montreal  alone.  In  1861  the 
number  had  increased  to  90,323,  in  1871  to  107,225,  and  in  1881  to  140,747 — again, in  these  successive 
decades,  of  respectively  56.15  and  31  per  cent.  Elsewhere  in  these  pages  will  appear  the  advancement 
within  the  last  decade.  As  early  as  1861  Montreal  held  the  tenth  place  among  the  Cities  of  North 
America,  as  shown  by  the  following  table  :

Montreal  was  merely  an  outport  of  Quebec  until  1832,  when  it  was  constituted  a  Port  of  Entry. 

In  the  year  1800,  the  number  of  vessels  cleared  at  the  Port  of  Quebec  was  64,  and  their  total  ton- 
nage was  14,293  tons.  They  canied  20,271  barrels  of  flour,  217,128  bushels  of  wheat,  3,512  bushels 
of  peas,  1,555  bushels  of  barley,  and  6,896  bushels  of  oats. 

In  1816,  the  number  of  vessels  cleared  had  risen  to  288,  and  their  total  tonnage  to  61,21 1, 

On  the  17th  of  February  of  the  following  year  (1817),  as  appears  by  the  journals  of  the  House  of 
Parliament  of  Lower  Canada,  one  Frangois  Pag^  petitioned  the  House,  representing  that  he  had, 
after  a  long  time,  perfected  a  machine  (steamboat)  for  navigating  the  St.  Lawrence  and  other  rivers  ; 
and,  considering  the  inclination  of  the  House  to  reward  public  benefactors,  he  prayed  to  be  granted  the 
exclusive  right  to  build  and  use  such  machines  (steamboats)  built  upon  the  said  model,  which  petition 
was  deemed  of  so  much  importance,  that  the  late  Andrew  Stuart,  by  command  of  the  Governor,  staled 
to  the  House  that  His  Excellency,  having  been  informed  of  the  purport  of  the  Petition,  gave  his  consent 
\.'\  doing  therewith  as  the  House  should  see  fit. 

On  the  38th  day  of  the  same  month  (February,  1817),  John  Goudie  represented  to  the  House 
that  two  American  steamboats  occasionally  ran  into  that  part  of  Lake  Champlain  which  lies  in  Cana- 
dian territory,  and  successfully  competed  for  Canadian  trade  ;  and  apprshending  very  evil  results  from 
such  free  intercourse,  he  asked  the  House  for  a  monopoly  of  commerce  by  steam  power  in  the  Canadian 
portion  of  Lake  Champlain. 

What  would  have  been  the  effect  of  conceding  the  proposed  monopolies  in  the  infancy  of  steam 
navigation  on  Lake  Champlain,  the  St.  Lawrence,  and  all  its  great  tributaries,  can  only  be  imagined. 

Fortunately  wise  counsels  prevailed,  and  the  Legislature  displayed  no  tendency  to  a  Chinese 
policy  of  exclusion  and  non-intercourse. 

In  1833,  when  Montreal  had  become  a  Port  of  Entry,  the  total  number  of  sea-going  vessels  which 
cleared  from  Montreal  and  Quebec  was  less  than  the  number  which  had  cleared  from  Quebec  alone  in 
the  previous  year,  and  their  tonnage  was  also  less,  the  number  sailing  from  Quebec  in  1832  having 
been  1,053,  "f  ^  '°'^'  burthen  of  281,598  tons,  against  969  in  1833,  of  247,933  t°"s  burthen,  and  133 
vessels  from  Montreal  of  30,769  tons  burthen  ;  yet,  for  some  cause,  neither  the  number  nor  the  tonnage 
of  vessels  clearing  from  Montreal  increased  in  6  years  following  1833  ;  but  the  year  1840  showed  a 
slight  improvement  up  to  137  vessels  of  31,266  tons  burthen. 


48 


Port  of  Montreal  up  to  Fall  of  1890. 


In  l86i,  the  number  of  vessels  was  3|',,  times  as  many  as  in  1833,  and  the  total  tonnage  had 
become  8  times  as  large  as  in  tiiat  year. 

In  Capper's  "  Port  and  Trade  of  London,"  it  is  stated  that  in  i860,  the  entire  Import  and  Export 
Trade  of  Great  Uritain  with  the  North  American  Colonies  was  valued  at  ^^10,496,769  sterling;  and 
as  in  that  year  the  value  of  Exports,  from  tiie  Port  of  Montreal,  was  $6,020,715,  and  the  value 
of  Imports  was  $15,479,453,  it  is  obvious  that  the  tiade  of  the  Mother  Country  with  Montreal,  at  that 
date,  was  nearly  half  her  whole  trade  with  the  British  North  American  Provinces, 

Thouf;h  in  1880  tlie  number  of  vessels  clearing  this  Port  was  only  710,  so  greatly  had  they 
increased  in  size,  that  while  in  point  of  numbers  the  augmentation  had  only  been  5.3  fold,  the  tonnage 
had  become  more  than  twenty  times  as  great  as  in  1833.  The  still  greater  enlargement  of  the  ships 
subsequently  employed  in  the  commerce  of  Montreal  presented  last  year  the  contrast  of  barely  5.2  the 
number  of  vessels  employed  in  1833,  having  more  than  twenty-six  times  their  capacity. 

Tlie  Customs  Duties  collected  at  the  Port  of  Montreal  amounted,  in  1858,  to  $1,673,503  ;  in 
1859,  to  $2,335,190;  in  1862,  to  $2,490,025;  in  1882,  to  $8,395,654.07;  and  in  1889,  to 
$9,321,981.91,  an  increase  of  4^^  /&gt;er  cent,  in  lliirly-one  years. 

Probably  the  increase  of  River  Craft  has  been  in  proportion  to  that  of  the  Sea-going  vessels. 

The  total  estimated  storage  capacity  of  Montreal  for  Flour  and  Wheat,  in  1869,  was  1,680,000 
bushels  of  wheat  and  417,000  barrels  of  flour.  Since  that  time  several  very  large  Elevators  have  been 
erected,  so  that  the  storage  capacity  is  equal  to  any  probable  demand  upon  it. 

The  receipts  of  Elour  at  this  Port  vaiied  but  little  from  1845  '"  i860,  inclusive  ;  the  smallest 
quantity  received  in  any  year,  1855,  being  433,011  barrels,  and  the  largest,  in  1858,  being  only  669,064 
barrels  ;  but,  in  1861,  the  quantity  received  reached  1,095,339,  nearly  double  the  receipts  of  the 
next  previous  year,  which  were  estimated  at  577,196.  Although  for  two  succeeding  years  the  total 
of  receipts  increased,  the  quantity  received  in  any  subsequent  year,  up  to  1870,  did  not  reach  one 
million  b.irrels ;  but  from  1871  to  1875,  there  was  an  average  annual  receipt  of  1,020,661  barrels, 
gainst  858,839  shipped. 

The  total  Exports  of  Grain  from  this  Port,  in  1887,  amounted  to  11,372,789  bushels. 

The  Export  of  Sawn  Lumber  from  this  Port  to  South  America,  which  was  previously  inconsider- 
able, reached  1,412,128  feet  in  1867,  and  31,592,960  in  1873,  and  then  diminished,  because  of  the 
unsettled  state  of  affairs  in  that  part  of  the  world. 

In  1880-81,  tlie  total  Produce  of  the  Forests  of  Canada  was  estimated  at  $22,326,184,  or  some- 
what over  $30  per  family  of  the  entire  Dominion. 

In  a  country  larger  than  the  United  States,  but  peopled  by  hardly  one-tenth  of  its  population,  hav- 
ing the  Ocean  on  two  sides  and  Inland  Seas  on  two  others,  and  drawing  its  revenues  largely  from 
Customs  Duties,  which  the  vast  extent  of  the  country  makes  it  possible  to  evade,  it  almost  necessarily 
happens  that  Government,  even  when  aided  by  the  advice  and  active  assistance  of  Boards  of  Trade  and 
the  Harbor  Commission,  must  ofteii  disregard  matters  of  convenience  to  the  Public  out  of  consideration 
for  matters  which  are  of  vital  importance.  However  sparsely  populated  a  country  may  be,  rocks  m  the 
course  of  its  navigation  must  be  marked  by  light-houpes  or  fog  signals,  to  save  the  country  the  reproach 
of  inhospitably  beguiling  into  unknown  dangers  foreign  mariners  who  trustfully  approach  its  shores.  It 
thus  happens  that  there  always  remains  some  boon  which  commerce  demands,  and  which  Government 
is  slow  to  concede,  bec.iuse  commerce  declines  to  Ix;  adequately  taxed  10  provide  it ;  while,  on  the 
hand,  there  are  imports,  dues  and  duties  of  which  Trade  is  weary,  but  which  Government  hesitates  to 
remove  until  commerce  is  made  as  safe  as  it  can  possibly  be. 

Seeing  that  our  great  Waterway,  which  furnishes  a  natural  outlet  for  the  products  of  half  a 
continent,  lies  in  direct  line  between  the  consumers  of  one  hemisphere  and  the  producers  of  another. 
Government  has  been  particularly  solicitous  of  good  capacious  canals  and  a  safe  and  deep  chan- 
nel to  the  Port  of  Montreal,  which,  being  at  the  head  of  navigation,  is  the  centre  of  the  railway 
system,  not  merely  of  Canada,  but,  in  part,  also  of  the  Northern  and  Western  St.ites,  and  this  not- 
withstanding adverse  legislation. 

Montreal,  besides  its  natural  advantage  of  being  central,  which  a  city  situated  like  New  York,  at 
the  sea-board,  cannot  be,  has  the  further  advantage  of  being  three  hundred  miles  nearer  Liverpool  than 


Port  of  Montreal  up  to  Fall  of  1890.

New  York.  It  is  nearer  the  latitude  of  Liverpool,  and  consequently  ships  sail  to  it  upon  a  shorter 
arc,  and  besides  being  nearer  to  both  producer  and  consumer,  it  offers  natural  and  therefore  cheaper 
transit  for  heavy  merchandise  than  Now  Yori&lt;  can  boast.  Indeed,  the  products  of  llie  wheatfields  of 
the  great  West,  both  of  Canada  and  the  United  States,  come  naturally  to  this  Tort  by  simple  ca- 
vitation. It  is  therefore  ol  paramount  importance  to  the  whole  country  that  navigation  throughout 
the  River  and  Gulf  of  St  I^wrence  should  be  made  safe  and  convenient.  In  this  connection  it  is  well 
to  consider  what  has  been  done  ami  what  is  l)eing  done  to  make  this  I'ort  easily  and  safely  accessilile 
and  as  inexpensive  as  possible.  Prior  to  1851  only  vessels  under  400  tons  and  drawing  not  more  than 
eleven  feet  of  water  could  pass  through  Lake  St  I'cler  and  up  to  the  Harbor  of  Montreal  ;  but  as  far 
back  as  1875,  vessels  drawing  i2  to  23^  feet  of  water,  and  being  from  3500  to  4000  tons  burthen, 
passed  down  to  the  sea.  This  was  made  possible  by  dredging  a  channel  through  the  enlargement  of 
the  River  St  Lawrence,  which  goes  by  the  name  of  Lake  St  Peter.  Tliis  work  was  begun  by  the 
Harbor  Commissioners  of  Montreal  in  June,  1851. 

Within  that  year  the  Channel  is  said  to  have  been  deepened  two  feet  for  a  breadth  of  75  feet. 
In  a  little  over  two  years  it  had  lieen  deepened  more  than  four  feet,  and  was  one  hundred  and  fifty  feet 
wide;  at  the  end  of  eight  years  it  was  deepened  over  seven  feet,  and  was  three  hundred  feet  in  width 
In  fourteen  years  there  was  a  twenty  foot  channel,  or  an  imi)rovemenl  of  nine  feet,  but  the  Harbor 
Commissioners  had  in  view  a  twenty-five  foot  channel,  to  admit  of  the  largest  sized  ships  coming  into 
Po't,  without  lighteiage.  Hut  before  the  Commissioners  had  attained  the  Jesidenitum  of  a  twenty  five 
foot  channel,  the  increasing  size  of  ships  trading  to  and  from  this  Port  convinced  the  Commission  and 
the  public  generally  a  depth  of  27^  feet  must  be  secured.  This  having  now  been  .iccomplished,  and 
the  Commissioners  having  been  relieved  by  Government  of  duties  outside  the  Harbor,  they  have  now 
turned  their  attention  to  much  needed  wharf  extension  and  many  other  strictly  Harbor  Improvements. 

Occ.isionally  Bills  before  Parliament,  or  the  Local  Legislature,  tend  to  interfere  with  free  navi- 
gation ;  but  the  Harbor  Commissioners  and  the  Board  of  Trade  have  been  hitherto  so  vigilant  as  to 
protect  the  Harbor  and  its  approach.  During  many  years  the  deepening  and  enlargement  of 
Canals  has  been  going  on  with  a  view  to  .securing  14  feet  depth  .ind  ample  Basins. 

A  Hydrographic  re-survey  of  the  Gulf  of  St  Lawrence  is  in  progress,  and  is  watched  by  Bri- 
tish as  well  as  Canadian  Scientists  and  Mariners,  because  it  is  doubted  whether  the  recent  loss  of  a 
vessel  was  not  due  to  an  unknown  current. 

The  opinions  of  captains  of  ships  are  being  collated  as  to  the  points  at  which  additional  signals 
and  lights  are  needed  in  the  River  and  Gulf,  and  also  in  the  Straits  of  Belieisle. 

Measures  are  also  being  taken  to  improve  the  Code  of  Signals  in  use  in  Inland  Navigation,  the 
necessity  whereof  was  made  evident  at  the  investigation  of  a  recent  collision  near  Longue  Pointe. 

Vessels  from  Montreal,  landing  a  few  passengers  or  goods  at  Quebec,  have  been  recently  relieved 
from  paying  police  dues  at  that  Port. 

It  is  probably  owing  to  the  above  mentioned  difficulties,  attending  v.ist  possessions,  a  sparse 
population,  and  the  consequent  financial  difiicully  of  foregoing  due?,  while  undertaking  fresh  works  of 
great  public  interest,  that  aUhough  the  Right  Honorable  Sir  John  A.  Macdonald  agrees  with 
the  Board  of  Trade  that  the  habitual  concession  of  a  special  rate  of  toll  of  two  cents  per  ton  on 
certain  grains  shipped  to  Montreal,  or  to  any  Port  east  of  Montreal,  loses  much  of  its  value  by  lack- 
ing the  quality  of  permanence,  which,  in  like  case  in  the  United  States,  has  been  secured  by  .in 
amendment  of  Constitution,  the  reduction  is  still  made  each  year  at  the  expense  of  a  deputation  of 
leading  men  to  Ottawa.  Only  grave  reasons  of  State  should  allow  the  continuance  of  this  incon- 
venient practice. 

The  Government  having  some  time  since  acknowledged  the  principle  long  contended  for,  that  the 
whole  country  should  share  the  cost  of  works  carried  on  in  the  genera'  interest  by  the  Harbor 
Commissioners  of  Montreal,  and  having  done  this  Port  tardy  justice  by  assuming  a  portion  of  the 
Harbor  Commissioners'  indebtedness  undertaken  to  improve  the  National  Highway,  it  is  hoped 
that  Government,  extending  the  application  of  this  principle  to  its  just  limits,  will  acknowledge  a 
further  claim  of  over  one  million  dollars  outlaid  by  the  Harbor  Commission  in  the  interest  of  the  Com- 
merce of  the  whole  Country,  in  which  case  improvements  in  the  Harbor  proper,  begun  or  pro- 
posed, including  extensive  wharves  and  graded  drive-ways,  may  be  proceeded  with  in  the  sjiring  of  1891.

The  total  number  of  arrivals  from  sea  this  year  has  been  746,  which  is  21  le.ss  than  in  1887,  but  51 
more  than  last  year,  and  91  more  than  in  1888.  The  numl&gt;er  of  arrivals  of  Ocean  Steamships  is  624. 
There  have  not  been  so  many  Sailing  Ships  in  Port  as  in  former  years,  but  in  these  there  has  been 
almost  a  steady  decrease  since  1870,  when  they  numbered  536  and  Steamships  only  1 14, 

The  total  tonnage  of  the  Ships  in  Port  this  year  exceeds  that  of  any  lormer  year.  The  total  ton- 
nage of  the  Port  up  to  the  1st  of  December  was  930,337.  The  greatest  tonnage  for  the  whole 
season  of  any  previous  year  is  only  870,773  (the  tonnage  of  1887), 

It  thus  appears  that  the  tonnage  of  this  year  exceeds  that  of  any  previous  year,  and  was 
107,227  tons  more  than  in  1889.  This  increase  proves  that  the  class  of  vessels  coming  to  Mont- 
real is  still  rapidly  improving,  and,  infeientially,  that  the  business  men  of  the  world  are  becoming 
more  and  more  aware  that  the  relative  importance  of  this  Port,  as  a  distributing  point,  is  far  beyond 
what  its  rank,  in  respect  of  population,  would  indicate. 

In  the  season  of  Navigation,  from  i^th  April  to  1st  December,  1890,  624  Ocean  Steamships,  of 
889,189  tons  burthen,  arrived  in  the  Port  of  Montreal ; 

During  the  same  season,  9  ships,  33  barques,  2  brigs,  8  brigantines,  and  70  schooners  (from 
the  Atlantic  Ocean),  with  a  total  of  41,143  tons  burthen,  arrived  in  Port. 

And,  during  same  season:  252  Gulf  and  River  steamers,  and  5,162  Inland  Craft,  with  966,959 
tons  burthen,  arrived  in  Port. 

Of  the  Ocean  Steamships  :  20  were  owned  by  Allan  Line  of  Steamships,  6  by  Donaldson  Line  of 
Steamships,  5  by  Ross  Steamship  Line  of  Steamships,  6  by  Thomson  Line  of  Steamships,  10  by 
Dominion  Line  of  Steamships,  5  by  Canada  Shipping  Co.  (Beaver  Line),  7  by  Hansa  Steamship  Co,,  2 
by  Bossifere  Line.

LOVELL'S  GAZETTEER  AND  HISTORY  OF  CANADA. 


My  first  attempt  to  obtain  subscriptions,  to  enable  me  to  issue  this  great 
work,  failed  for  want  of  sufficient  means  to  pursue  a  canvass  throughout  the 
Dominion. 

An  attempt  is  now  being  made  to  form  a  Joint  Stock  Company,  with 
a  capital  of  $200,000,  in  shares  of  $100  each,  to  be  called  The  Canadian 
Publishing  Company,  Limited. 

For  Prospectus  and  details,  see  pages  2,  3  and  4  of  the  Cover  of  this 
Historic  Report  of  Census  of  Montreal;  and,  especially,  read  Mr. 
Bixby's  Letter,  and  some  of  the  Opinions  of  the  Ontario  Press.

JOHN  LUVELL,  Publisher. 


MoNTKEAL,  March,  1891. 


LOVELL'S  GAZETTEER  AND  HISTORY   OF  CANADA. 

To  he  commenced  an  hoom  a»  the  tubicriplions  cover  the  coat  of  /niblicntion. 


The  true  history  of  this  magnificent  country  is  yet  to  be  written  ;  that  is,  of  the 
places  in  it.  A  correct  and  a  truly  National  History  would  place  Canada  in  a 
foremost  rank.  It  would  ricord  the  wonderful  j^rogrcss  of  this  broad  Dominion.  It 
would  chronicle  every  leading  feature,  and  especially  the  wealth  which  the  magnificent 
Allan  Line  of  Steamships,  and  now  of  other  Lines  of  Steamships  are  bringing  to  this 
country.  It  would  show  how  the  Orand  Trunk  Railway  and  the  Canadian  Pacific 
Railway  are  opening  up  our  enormous  Canada  and  its  billions  of  acres,  too  rich 
to  be  allowed  to  remain  much  longer  unknown. 

In  connection  with  this  great  undertaking,  of  the  character  and  extent  of  which 
the  Canadian  public  have  been  already  sufficiently  informed  through  my  l'ros[)ectus 
and  The  Press,  the  following  letter,  addressed  to  me,  will  afford  some  idea  of  the 
manner  in  which  the  project  has  impressed  the  mind  of  an  intelligent  and 
disinterested  American  gentlemen,  residing  in  Plattsburgh,  N.  Y. 

Dkar  Sir, — I  lake  pleasure  in  acknowlcdginj;  the  receipt  of  your  esteemed  favor  of  .Sept.  6th, 
with  your  revised  I'rospectus  ami  Sample  Hacks  of  the  jjreat  liistorical  work  which  you  have  projected. 
I  find  it  difficult  to  speak,  write  or  think  alxiut  this  undertaking  without  enthusiasm.  Such  an  attempt, 
to  gather  in  the  threads  of  unwritten  liiNtory  from  such  a  domain  as  the  entire  Dominion  of  Canada, 
stands  witliout  a  parallel,  certainly  in  the  .New  Woild.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  carrying  out  of  your 
plan  will  add  a  most  valuable  characteristic  t"  Canadian  history — sujiplying,  in  it.-*  contributions  from 
real  life,  what  the  breathing  living  organism  is  to  the  skeleton. 

Large  as  the  task  is,  which  you  have  undertaken,  I  believe  you  will  see  its  accomplishment.  I 
cannot  think  that  business  people,  and  the  brainy  people  of  Canada,  will  allow  you  to  fail  of  carrying 
out  a  plan  so  vital  to  the  interests  of  every  parish.  It  is  a  work  which  delay  renders  more  and  more 
difficult  of  accomplishment,  as  old  jieople  pass  away.  To-day  their  recollection  is  clear,  but  to  morrow 
they  may  be  gone,  and  the  light  they  only  could  supply  goes  out  with  them.  Regretting  that  I  can  do 
so  little  beyond  wishing  you  tlod  speed,  I  remain,  yours  most  sincerely, 

GKO.  F.  liixnv. 

Local  records  in  the  work  will  he  llioroughly  rev'  ed  by  recognized  masters  of 
the  subject,  before  being  tiiially  |)resented  to  the  public.  In  every  case,  the  Kditor's 
debt  to  previous  writers,  to  unpublished  manuscripts  and  to  viva  voce  suggestions  will 
be  definitely  acknowledged,  in  order  that  students,  so  desiring,  may  draw  instruction 
from  the  same  sources. 

The  origines  of  places  treated  with  special  fulness,  especially  when  the  founders 
and  pioneers  are  men  of  moral  and  intellectual  vigor,  they  impress  their  characters  on 
their  work,  and  the  preservation  of  their  memories  must  have  an  insiiiring  effect  on 
those  who  come  after  them.  Their  association  with  the  great  and  good  of  a  past  day 
has  had  a  salutary  influence  on  several  of  our  Canadian  cities,  and  on  none  of  them 
more  iicrceptii)ly  than  on  Montreal,  the  story  of  whose  birth  and  early  years  is  almost 
without  parallel  in  the  annals  of  civilization. 

Although  my  first  attempt  failed  for  want  of  pecuniary  support,  I  have  resolved  to 
make  another  trial.  This  time  by  a  Joint  Stock  Company  with  a  capital  of  $joo,ooo, 
in  shares  of  $ioo  each.  After  $150,000  are  subscribed  for,  a  call  of  five  per  cent, 
will  be  made  to  raise  a  fund,  to  be  ai)plied  to  a  thorough  canvass  of  each  Province  in 
the  Dominion  for  subscribers  for  copies.  Should  the  result  amount  to  $150,000,  the 
matter  will  at  once  be  made  known  to  the  Stockholders,  and  their  decision  to  put  the  i 
preparation  of  the  Eleven  volumes  into  my  hands  by  the  appointment  of  the  Editor-  |

I 


132 


jOveU's  Historic  Report  of  Census  of  Montreal 


in-Chief,  the  Assistant  Editor,  the  Editor  of  Statistics,  of  Eight  Superintending 
Revising-Editors,  one  for  each  Province,  and  One  Hundred  Province  Editors  will  be 
considered  final.  By  this  means  the  Eleven  volumes  could  be  completed  and 
published  within  two  years  from  date  of  commencing.  Should  the  Subscription  Can- 
vassers fail  in  their  mission,  the  work  will  again  be  abandoned,  with  a  loss  to  the 
Shareholders  of  five  per  cent,  paid  in  on  each  share ;  but,  should  the  canvass  prove 
favorable,  I  should  have  the  privilege  of  re-purchasing  subscribed  shares,  by  allowing 
eight  ]5er  cent,  from  time  of  payment. 

The  following  is  a  fair  sample  of  how  every  place,  having  a  name,  in  the  Dominion, 
would  be  inserted  in  Lovell's  Gazetteer  and  History  ok  Canada  ;

A  Very  Great  Enterprise. 

To  the  Editor  if  The  Gazette. 

Silt,— As  an  old  resident  of  Montreal  who  takes  a  lively  interest  iu  its  progress  and  in  that  of  my  fellow- 
citizens,  I  woBld  beg  respectfully  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  public  to  what  I  term  a  gigantic  enterprise,  which 
is  now  being  carrie&lt;l  out  by  one  of  the  worthiest  and  most  respected  men  in  town— 1  refer  to  the  veteran 
publisher,  Mr.  John  Loveli,  and  his  projected  Gazetteer  and  Hi.story  of  Canada.  The  work  is  an  immense  one, 
particularly  for  a  gentleman  of  .Mr,  Loveli' s  years,  and  that  he  should  have  gone  to  work  ui&gt;on  it  demonstrates 
the  enterprising  pluck  of  which  he  is  possessed.  The  work,  when  completed,  will  be  a  monument  to  his  perse- 
verance aiul  his  energy  in  struggling  with  dillieulties,  wliich  to  many  younger  men  would  be  altogether  insur- 
mountable. The  enterprise  is  one  in  which  every  citizen  of  Montreal  should  take  an  interest.  The  Gazetteer 
and  History  will  be  invaluable  to  our  busicess  men,  and  I  trust  all  who  can  do  so  will  become  subscribers,  at 
once,  so  as  to  make  the  project  an  assured  success  from  the  commencement. 

Yours  truly,  WD.  STKOUD. 

To  the  Editor  (f'ViiK  Gazetti:. 

Silt,— In  your  issue  of  yesterday  appears  a  very  kind  letter  from  W,  D.  SriiouD,  Esquire,  in  favor  of  my 
project.  To  this  estimable  citizen,  I  beg  to  tender  my  most  sincere  thanks,  not  only  for  tlie  letter  but  for  the 
kinil  way  in  which  he  subscribed  for  nine  volumes  of  my  projected  Gazetteer  and  History  of  Canada.  His 
wish  to  see  such  a  work  issued  did  not  end  here.  After  signing  his  name,  he  said  :  "  Air,  I.ovell,  in  case  your 
subscription  list  does  not  come  up  to  your  expectation,  put  me  down  for  live  additional  sets  to  help  your  great 
enterprise."  This  maguilloent  olfer  is  worthy  of  all  praise,  Kvery  good  man  will  glory  in  sucli  a  citizen.  It 
has  my  heartfelt  iliaiiki'.  It  is  a  noble  contribution  towards  the  issue  of  one  of  the  greatest  woiks  ever 
attempted  in  this  wonderful  ami  prosperous  country. 

ToMr.  Wm.  Dkvsdai.k,  publisher,  and  to  other  gentlemen,  I  also  beg  to  oiler  my  thanks  for  llieir  volun- 
tary subscripUo  sand  for  having  put  my  projected  Gazetteer  and  History  prominently  forward  iliiouyh  the 
I'ress,  and  by  their  ttroiig  and  forcible  advocacy  of  the  true  value  of  the  work. 

For  thirty-live  years  the  thought  of  being  of  use  to  my  country,  by  publishing  a  true  History  of  every  place 
in  it,  has  chceringly  urged  me  on.     While  health  and  strengtli  are  mine  I  will  iiersevcre  in  my  elTort. 

Youis  obediently, 

JOHN  I.OVKI.l&gt;,  I'ubUsher.

ST  LOUIS  DE  MILE  END.

i 


An  incorporated  Village  near  the  east  end  of  Mount  Royal,  Parish  of  L'Enfant  Jesun,  Seigniory 
of  Montreal,  County  of  Hochelaga.  This  Village  wa:^  formerly  united  with  Coteau  St  Louis 
and  Cote  Vinitution  in  one  municipality  ;  but  in  1878  it  wan  ii;corporateil  as  a  separate  Munici- 
pality with  a  Mayor  and  seven  Councillors.  Before  the  year  1800  ti»e  site  on  which  the  Village 
stands  was  a  forest,  and  mostly  belonged  to  Pierre  D.  Bi'lair.  An  Englishman,  named  Mount- 
pleasant,  ])urchased  it  from  the  former  owner,  and  experimented  in  orchard  ctdture  with  a  large 
stock  of  fruit  trees  imported  from  England.  His  attempt  was  unsuccessful,  and  the  land  passed 
into  the  Whitehall  and  Knapp  families.  A  few  years  later  John  and  Jacob  Wiirlele  purchased  a 
large  portion  of  it,  and  in  ISU!  it  was  subdivided  between  Wurtele,  Fortior,  John  .Spalding, 
Richard  Smith,  and  others.  Still  later  Stanley  Bagg  purchased  a  tract  of  about  forty  acres,  on 
a  portion  of  which  the  Provincial  E.xhibition  buildings  are  now  erectetl.  In  ISO.*)  a  clearance 
was  made  on  the  west  side  of  St  Lawrence  roal  to  the  brow  of  the  Mountain,  northward  from 
where  the  Hotel  Dieu  Convent  and  Hospital  now  stands,  to  the  present  Mount  lloyal  avenue. 
The  clearance  was  turned  into  pa-^ture  land  and  a  race  course.  The  course  was  then  the  only 
one  in  either  Lower  or  U|iper  Canada,  llobert  Lovell  and  family,  in  1820  and  1821,  occupied 
what  was  then  known  as  the  Wnrtele  property,  now  almost  the  centre  of  this  prosperous  and 
progressive  village,  then  known  as  the  Mile  End.  On  the  outskirts  are  several  farms,  among 
which  may  be  noted  that  of  John  Si)aliling,  whose  father  was  one  of  the  first  pioneers  in  this 
district.  All  this  immense  tract  of  lam!  had  originally  belonged  to  the  Seminary  of  St  Snlpice 
and  to  the  Ladies  of  the  Hotel  Dieu.  A  Catholic  Chnich  was  buili  in  1857,  in  connection  witli 
which  are  the  Convent  of  the  Sisters  of  Providence,  and  an  extensive  Institution  for  Deaf  Mutes 
(males),  which  is  under  the  control  of  the  Clercs  do  St  Viateur.  Attached  to  this  Institutioi 
is  a  manufactory  where  various  trades  are  taught  to  the  alllicted  inmates.  The  Canadian 
Pacific  Railway  runs  through  the  village,  and  near  the  station  is  a  large  Kerosene  Oil  Hefincrr. 
Mail  daily-     Distance  from   Montreal  Parish   Church,   1    mile. 

Population: — 1723  females;  17213  males  ;  1660  Catholic  females;  1651)  Catholic  nuvles ; 
63  Protestant  females  ;  67  Protestant  males.     Total  .Jltll. 

It  has  I0.'i7  houses: — 343  brick;  8  dashed;    15  stone  ;    671  wooden.

OUTREMONT. 

An  iiicoi polluted  village,  situated  on  ti.o  north  side  nf  Mount-Royal,  parish  of  I'Enfant-J^sus,  district 
of  Montreal,  county  of  Ilochelaga.  The  site  on  which  the  village  stands  was  originally  tiie  property 
of  the  Reverend  Sulpicians,  and  was  known  as  Cote  St.  I'atherine,  in  the  parish  of  Montreal,  The 
road  had  been  constructed  around  the  base  of  the  mountain,  and  served  as  an  outlet  to  Cote  des  Xeiges 
and  St.  Laurent.  About  ninety  years  ago  Jos.^ph  I'erraull,  legislative  councillor  and  l''ran9ois  Desca- 
ries,  appear  to  have  become  proprietors  of  all  the  land  which  comprises  Outrcmont.  .Vt  this  time  it 
was  nothing  but  a  bush,  iienjamin  Hall  a  few  years  after  purchased  a  large  porticjn  of  it,  and  farms 
were  fairly  started.  The  land  which  sloped  away  into  the  St.  Laurent  valley  proved  very  fertile,  and 
several  gentlemen  of  means  procured  farms.  Among  those  were  John  Gray,  who  had  a  large  foundry. 
Colonel  Maxwell,  Warien  Uease,  who  had  made  a  handsome  forlune  in  the  fur  trade  of  the  North 
West,  and  Doctor  lieaubicn,  father  of  the  Honorable  Louis  IJeaubien.  In  the  course  of  lime,  the  land 
became  more  and  more  sidxlivided  for  farming  purposes,  and  John  McMartin,  Jean  l!outh:!lier, 
Frani;ols  Imbaidt,  D.  Lorn  MacDougall,  Sherill'  John  Boston,  John  Wiseman,  Thomas  W"iseman, 
Dennis  Horrigan,  Wni.  Kraser  and  William  .Salter  made  their  homes  there. 

John  Clarke  became  the  purchaser  of  a  valual)!f  site  for  a  country  seat,  comprising  se.eral  acres 
of  land.  This  gentleman  had  amassed  a  large  fcrtune  in  the  service  of  the  Hudson  Day  Co,  He 
spent  a  consideiable  sum  here  in  the  erection  of  a  hantlsome  resilience,  which  he  named  licaver  Lodge, 
The  grounds  were  beautifully  and  lu.xuriantly  cultivated.  He  entertained  his  friends  in  a  princely 
manner.  He  was  well  known  to  the  writer  of  tins  short  sketch.  His  grand  physique,  line  qualities, 
coninianding  appearance,  are  still  fresh  in  the  memory  of  the  writer.  lie  was  noted  for  his  bravery, 
huniamty  and  self-possession  on  trying  decisions.  C)ne  of  his  daring  acts  is  worthy  nf  mention  here, 
and  ihe  followmg  account  of  it  is  from  the  lips  of  his  eldest  tlaughter.  Miss  Adele  Clarke  ;  While  he 
was  m  1-Ort  Garry,  with  his  famdy,  a  large  body  of  Lulians  approached  the  place  in  their  w"r  costume, 
with  painted  faces,  determined  on  exterminating  the  devoted  inmates.  Mr.  Clarke,  being  a  leading 
citizen,  entreated  the  men  of  the  Fort  to  stand  at  their  posts  and  to  give  liglit  to  their  relentless  foe. 
The  overwhelming  mimhers  outside  the  Fort  had  a  disheartening  elfect  on  the  besieged,  most  of  whom, 
in  their  despondency,  would  have  met  death  without  striking  a  blow.  I5ut,  fortunately,  the  co(il- 
headed  John  Clarke  was  not  so  easily  cowed.  He  instantly  resolved  to  meet  the  lle:ce  Indians,  and  he 
accordingly  ordered  the  gate  to  be  opened.  He  marched  out  alone,  unarmed,  and,  as  he  ssued  forth, 
ordered  the  gate  to  be  clostd.  Tiie  Itrave  man,  with  outstretched  arms,  walked  to  where  the  Indians 
were  encamped.  I'hey  approached  him  with  awe,  believing  that  a  superior  being  stood  before  them. 
Tiiey  began  by  feeling  I'.is  toes,  his  fingers.  Ids  bod)  The  Indian  chief  (lut  his  hand  on  Mr.  Clarke's 
heaj,  and  offered  him  his  (-(//^Wt'/ as  a  syml.iol  of  peace.  In  fine,  his  intre|iid  conduct  secured  the 
withdrawal  of  the  Indians,  and  lie  returned  to  the  Fort  amidst  the  warmly  expressed  admiration  and 
gratitude  of  the  fear-stricken  occupants.  His  esiimable  widow,  two  of  his  daughters,  and  one  son  are 
now  (1S91)  residing  on  Clarke  avenue,  a  delightful  locality  on  the  western  outskirts  of  Montreal. 

Syhmcv  RoHl-.Ur  l!r,I.l.INc,ll.\M  became  the  i)uiehaser  of  a  large  and  valuable  tract  of  land  in  this 
place,  beautifully  situated  on  the  nortli  brow  of  the  Mountain  (Mount-Royal).  There  he  built  a  com- 
fortable house,  m  which  he  resided,  with  his  family,  for  many  years.  Mr.  Hellingham  was  ever  an 
active  and  useful  citizen.  He  sei  ved  this  country,  as  a  British  subject,  laithlully  and  honorably  ;  as  an 
able  writer,  as  one  of  its  legislators  in  the  House  of  Commons,  but  especially  in  the  trying  times  of 
1837-3.S,  when  he  rendered  signal  service  during  tlie  march  of  a  liandful  of  suldiers  to  St.  Chailes, 
under  the  command  of  the  valiant  Culonel  Welherall.  At  St.  llilaire  it  was  ascertained  that  there 
were  at  Ic't  3,000  insurgents  in  arms  at  St.  Charles.  The  t  olonel  had  only  120  men,  all  told,  umler 
his  command.  Mr.  Bellingham  was  in  command  of  the  movements  and  actions  of  the  soldiers.  On 
consultation  he  and  the  amiable  Colonel  HeRouviUe  (at  whose  house  Colonel  Welherall,  Mr. 
Bellinghanij  Ca|)tain  Glasgcnv,  Captain  David,  aii'l  olliers,  were  staying)  recommended  that  a 
despatch  sliould  be  sent  to  Chambly  to  the  brave  and  noble  soldier,  Major  Ward,  who  hail  two 
companies  of  liie  Royals  and  one  of  the  32nd  Regiment  under  his  command  in  that  place.  Xot 
satislied  with  merely  sending  for  Major  Ward,  Mr.  Bellinghiim  actually  volunteered  lo  carry  Colonel 
Wetherall's  despatch  himself.  A  volunteer  Montreal  Cavalry  trooper,  of  nine  years'  standing,  con- 
sented to  be  his  compai^noii  dc  voyage.  At  one  o'clock  on  a  dark  night  in  November,  1837,  both 
started  on  their  perilous  mission,  with  the  understanding  that  if  either  fell  on  the  way  by  the  hands  of 
the  enemy  the  other  was  to  ride  on  as  long  as  the  road  was  free.  I'ortunately  both  reached  Point 
Olivier  ferry  at  four  o'clock,  a.m.,  aroused  the  reluctant  ferryman  from  his  bed,  and  compelled  him  to 
ferry  them  across  the  Richelieu.  .Shi. illy  afterwards  they  reached  Chambly  on  jaded  horses,  which, h.ad 
they  not  been  well  bred,  would  never  have  been  equal  to  the  laligue  of  such  a  journey  over  rough  and 
almost  impassable  roads.  Major  Ward  was  soon  aroused  by  the  sentinel.  After  receiving  tiie  des- 
patch and  exchanging  a  few  words  with  Mr.  Bellingham,  the  gallant  soldier,  with  two  companies  nf 
the  Royals,  one  company  of  the  32nd  Regiment,  Mr.  Sydney  R.  Bellingham,  and  the  Montreal  Cavalry 
trooper,  set  out  on  tlieir  way  to  .St.  Hilaire.  Well  might  their  arrival  gladden  ihe  heart  of  the  brave 
Colonel  Welherall  and  of  the  loyal  DeRouville,  f&lt;jr,  under  Providence,  it  was  the  means,  not  iMily  of 
saving  valuable  lives  and  much  treasure,  but  of  preserving  this  country  to  their  beloved  I'atherlanil. 
With  the  ailditional  force  the  march  to  St.  Charles  was  begun  early  on  the  morning  of  the  following 
day,  and  the  destination  was  reached  about  12  noon.  While  Hearing  St.  Cliaries,  liolonel  Welherall 
noticed  a  fine-looking  old  man,  with  white  locks,  a  picture  of  goodness — standing  at  his  door.  The 
Colonel  was  struck  with  the  old  man's  line  appearance,  attitude  and  carriage,  and  at  once  ordered  the 


Montreal  Cavalry  trooper  to  bring  him  into  his  presence.  The  Colonel  addressed  this  aged  habitant 
in  French,  assuring  him  that  he  was  desiious  of  meeting  his  misguided  countrymen  in  a  friendly  way, 
and  requested  him  to  go  up  to  the  breiistworks  and  ask  his  fellow-countrymen  to  lay  down  their  arms 
in  order  that  the  Colonel  might  enter  into  a  parley  with  them.  The  venerable  man  was  soon  on  the 
way.  He  was  seen  entering  the  breastworks — but  not  to  return.  The  answer  from  within  was  the 
discharge  of  such  cannon  as  the  insurgents  possessed,  and  a  broadside  of  small  arms,  sufficient,  if  well 
ainv'd.to  have  laid  low  every  British  soldier  on  the  field.  The  gallant  and  well-meaning  Colonel  had 
a  fetv  of  his  men  wounded  and  two  killed,  but  lost  no  time.  In  about  ten  minutes  after  the  action 
commenced  his  horse  was  shot  dead  under  him.  In  a  moment  Sydney  Robert  Hellingh.im,  Esq  ,  was 
at  tlie  side  of  his  dismounted  Colonel,  placing  his  own  charger  at  the  Colonel's  disposal.  Tlie  latter 
in  a  moment  was  on  the  powerful  horse,  ordered  his  men  into  line  across  the  field,  of  course  in  single 
file,  .ind  |)laced  Major  Ward,  with  a  few  men,  close  to  the  breastworks.  For  hours  the  action  appeared 
to  be  in  favor  of  the  insurgents,  3,000  of  them  stood  against  300,  but  the  latter  were  Britisli  soldiers, 
whose  evolutions  were  directed  by  an  al)le  and  experienced  commander.  The  ste.idy  fire  and  courage 
of  the  insurgents  were  certainly  worthy  of  a  better  cause.  Tiie  only  hope,  at  this  trying  moment,  for 
the  gallant  Colonel  was  to  command  a  charge  on  the  breastworks.  It  was  done  in  royal  style,  and 
with  a  shout  that  raised  every  man's  courage.  The  breastworks,  after  severe  fighting,  were  carried  at 
the  point  of  the  bayonet.  Here  Major  Ward  distinguished  himself  as  a  soldier  of  courage  and 
endurance. 

This  account  of  tlie  taking  of  St.  Charles  is  written  as  a  simple  .TCt  of  justice  to  a  gentleman 
whose  services  liave  never  been  fully  acknowledged.  The  writer  had  known  him  with  pnde,  with 
plea-'Ure,  for  upwards  of  fifty  years  as  a  manlv  defender  &lt;jf  right  and  a  hater  of  oppression.  Sydney 
Roliert  Bellingham,  Esq.,  was  ever  r.  true  fi lend, confiding,  generous  and  noble-hearted.  His  every  act 
was  that  of  a  l)rave  man.  Without  him  the  1  iinented  Major  Ward  and  his  valiant  soldiers  would  not 
have  been  on  tlie  field,  and  positive  defeat  would  have  closed  the  campaign.  The  writer  of  this  sketch 
witnessed  the  battle.  He  can  honestly  say  that  the  service  rendereil  to  (Jolonel  Wetherall  l&gt;y  Major 
Ward,  sword  in  hand,  decided  the  success  of  the  loyalists  in  the  engagement.  The  writer  counted 
nineteen  bullet  holes  in  the  Major's  military  frock  coat,  and  his  horse  was  ri&lt;ldled  with  bullets.  The 
fine  animal  carried  his  master  tdl  his  work  was  accomplished,  and  died  soon  after  the  battle  was  won. 
Wonderful  to  lelate — the  gallant  M;ijor  himself  escaped  without  even  a  flesh  wound. 

On  the  day  after  the  battle  Mr.  Belllngham  requested  Colonel  Wetherall  to  ,\ccept  the  fine  liorse 
winch  that  brave  officer  had  ridden  at  the  battle,  as  a  slight  memorial  of  Ins  signal  victory.  The  gift, 
so  gracefully  olTered,  was,  the  writer  may  add,  gracefully  accepted. 

Mr.  Bellinghani's  bravery  and  foresight  throughout  the  entire  march,  and  especially  his  valor  in 
risking  his  life  to  secure  Major  Ward's  timely  and  telling  help,  formed  tlie  topic  of  conversation  among 
the  victors  of  St.  Charles.  But  for  his  timely  aid  the  effort  to  ivduce  so  determined  and  well  organized 
a  foe  would  probably  have  tnded  in  failure.  Mr.  Bellingham  is  now  (1891)  spending  the  evening  of 
his  days  in  quiet  retirement  in  his  native  country — Ireland. 

In  1875  the  village  was  incorporated  as  a  municipality,  with  a  mayor  and  6  councillors,  uiider  the 
name  of  Outremont.  Several  substantial  houses  were  erected  and  groujied  themselves  into  a  village. 
Tile  farms  are  well  tilled,  and  the  orchards  and  gardens  are  among  the  finest.  A  small  chapel  has 
been  erected,  where  the  service  of  the  Church  of  fclngland  is  held. 

Outremont  is  destined  ta  become  one  of  the  most  favorite  suburban  retreats  of  Montreal.  Its 
pleasant  site  and  agreeable  approach  to  the  city  have  already  niduced  many  prominent  business 
men  to  take  up  their  residence  there.     Mail  daily  ;    omnibus  twice  daily.     tJne  mile   from   Montreal. 

Population: — 173  females;  190  males  ;  43  Catholic  females  ;  55  Catholic  miles  ;  130  I'rotestant 
females;    135  Protestant  males.     Total  363. 

Outremont  has  65  houses  ; — 26  brick  ;   2  dashed  ;    1 1  stone  ;   26  wooden.
