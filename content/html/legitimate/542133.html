<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>The Lonely H's at The Vista </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Four of the five members of The Lonely H just graduated high school in June of '07 and went on their first ever U.S. tour for two months.  Now they're back at it - and dropped out of college to pursue the rock 'n' roll dream. So they mean it!  And have the sound to back it up.
<p>
Swaddled tight in the electrified buckskin of their classic rock-n-roll forefathers, our five Washington braves set out to blanket America in a hot winter blizzard. Don't be fooled by the silk strands tucked behind their ears: what the maps don't tell you is that all-night drives make for better lives, deer come out of nowhere, and what parents don't know (night after night) won't kill them.
<p>
The Lonely H spent their graduation summer [2007] touring coast-to-coast in support of their new record and got a glimmer of the mission they were born to undertake. Tour is a magical place where every stage, no matter how high, is a new opportunity to deliver the goods. Armed with melodies that sound like letters to Penthouse etched on colored vinyl, the band lifted, lightened, and gave rise to every technical challenge. Bulletins started coming in over the wire from fans and bloggers [MSNBC, The New York Post, CMJ]. So, from Memphis to Manhattan went pockets full of picks, licks, pianos, and the living-loving swagger that has happily intoxicated the Pacific Northwest the last few years.
<p>
Thanks to these starlit marauders, Port Angeles can sometimes sound like the good parts of 1970's Los Angeles depending what Saturday night they're home. Idling the van for a wise fall quarter at the University Of Washington, the H cracked books and fantasized with giddy relief about their soon-to-be-months out on the road in 2008. They can handle it, mama. Not only did they survive the twelfth grade riding ferries to play rock shows on school nights, they simultaneously penned and released two albums with heart and heat to match [Kick Upstairs (2006) and Hair (2007) ­ The Control Group].

See you next year...without a signed permission slip.

Folk-rock duo Tegan and Sara first burst onto the Canadian music scene in 1998, when they earned the highest score in history at Calgary's "Garage Warz" competition. Their quick rise didn't stop, for their melodic acoustics and charming stage personas led to a slew of dates with Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair that same year and a record deal with Neil Young's Vapor Records. In 2007, Tegan sang backup on a song on new Sire labelmate Against Me!'s album New Wave, and the twins, who had by now moved far from the singer/songwriter mold and were more interested in exploring pop, punk, and indie rock, came out with Christopher Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie) who produced The Con.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">AS Presents Pinback and MC Chris on Saturday, April 19th at 9 p.m. in the Kate Buchanan Room, Humboldt State University. San Diegos Pinback create some of the most complex, postmodern indie pop happening on the West Coast. Tickets are $17.50 general and $12.50 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU, the Works in Eureka/Arcata and The Metro.
			<p>
Pinback is a band comprised of two principal players: Armistead Burwell Smith IV (Zach) and Rob Crow. Pinback started as a part-time endeavor back in 1998, when Zach's band Three Mile Pilot went on an extended hiatus and Rob found time away from his other musical interests (mainly Thingy and Heavy Vegetable). After recording their self-titled debut, released by Ace Fu in 1999, Pinback became a fully realized project. 
<p>
The next few years saw an increase in Pinback activity. The released a number of albums and EPs on a variety of record labels most notably Blue Screen Life in 2000 and Summer in Abaddon in 2003. Abaddon hit the scene like high tide gliding in, whirling around listeners, full of beautiful intensity. It found its place in the hearts of a crazy amount of people worldwide following the success of the single Fortress, and rightfully so. Between record releases, Pinback toured as a full band, hitting points across North America and Europe. <p>

The bands latest release, Autumn of the Seraphs, pushes forward and upward. Its melodies are more dynamic and aggressive, while still gently pulling you back in again and again. While entirely recorded in the bands home studios once again, this record is tighter, the drumming more immediate and crisp. Those duties were shared by Mario Rubalcaba (Rocket from the Crypt) and Chris Prescott (No Knife), and its a marked difference from Pinbacks previous releases. Good to Sea is the jam of Indian summer. Walters saunters its way to a buzzy guitar breakdown while Subbing for Eden works steadily toward each climactic chorus. Its Pinbacks best yet, and its going to take you over.
<p>
Returning to Arcata from a recent sold out gig at Humbrews and warming up the stage is MC Chris. From voicing characters on the Cartoon Network (MC Pee Pants on Aqua Teen Hunger Force and various characters on Adult Swim amongst others) MC Chris is now one of the leading lights in the Nerd Core hip-hop movement.<p>

Xmas shows plus the usual rock, jazz, punk etc. 
There are 12 shopping days until Xmas, but don't start counting those partridges yet, not unless you're part of the Christmas bird count. "The Twelve Days of Christmas" you hear about in song this time of year start on Christmas Day and run until Epiphany (the day the wise guys came to call). 
What with the proximity to the big day, the entertainment is rolling into full holidaze mode with diminishing club action amid dancing mice and visions of sugarplums. (What other time of year do people attend ballet performances?)
Up at the Van Duzer Friday, they have Tomáseen Foleys A Celtic Christmas, with Xmas stories and all sorts of Irishness  pennywhistles, stepdancing  you get the picture. Unfortunately Riverdance has permanently spoiled Irish dancing for me, and I can't hear a pennywhistle without thinking of those horrid Irish Spring soap commercials. <p>
I'm thinking A Very Playhouse Christmas may be more my speed. If you haven't heard about it, it's a holiday-themed music/comedy review going into its second (and final) weekend at the Arcata Playhouse. The director is David Ferney who runs the Playhouse; his wife, Jackie Dandeneau, is one of three stars of the show, which David explained is a direct result of Jackie's feelings for the holiday season. 
"Jackie loves everything about Christmas," David told me, admitting that he just kind of likes it. "And she's always wanted to do a Christmasy show," he continued.
In the show Jackie is Mrs. O.R. Ganize, an obsessive/compulsive type who organizes a Christmas show with help from her aerobics instructor Babbette LeJoie (Elizabeth Masters), an '80s New Jersey type who David describes as "over-the-top bubbly." Dell'Arte vet Tyler Olsen plays Mr. S.K. Rooge IX, who, as you might guess, is the Scrooge-ish anti-Xmas foil, in this case one who's intent on a politically correct holiday. The interactions of the trio provide a framework for slapstick, silliness and songs, with the always-amazing Tim Randles at the keyboard providing soundtrack and backing. They've also worked in a collection of guests including Tara Caraiso, Sarah Cory, Lewis Armin-Hoiland, the Blue Lake Children's Choir and the Arcata Interfaith Gospel Choir. (The AIGC will be at the Playhouse Friday night; they're also singing on the Arcata Plaza earlier for Arts! Arcata. And they have their own holiday show in at the Presbyterian Church in Eureka Saturday evening.) The always enchanting Lila Nelson is in the Playhouse show Saturday, and, notes David, just confirmed for the Sunday matinee, "the lovely and talented Beti Trauth," who saw the review last weekend and was recruited on the spot.

It will start directly after the Dell'Arte holiday show, The Hunting of the Snark, which probably, means around 9:30-ish." I've heard good things about Dell'Arte's musical adaptation of Lewis Carroll's strange nonsense poem and about Deric's new band Tanuki. And Jane is just plain great. The combination should make for a fine Saturday night.

More seasonality: The theatrical folks from Shake The Bard are taping Static and Starlight: A Holiday Radio Show by Tim McDermond at the Accident Gallery Friday and Saturday. If you miss it or want to relive the experience, tune to KGOE (1480 AM) or KKDS (97.7 FM) on Sunday, Dec. 16, at 4 p.m.<p>

The Pearl Lounge celebrates its second anniversary on Saturday, Dec. 15, with a performance by the band that opened the place, Humboldt Time with Michael Curran on drums, Jim Wilde guitar, Sam Maez trumpet, Jimmy Durchslag trombone and Geoff Daugherty bass. If you haven't heard of them and can't figure it out from the array of instruments, Humboldt Time is a jazz band. They also play the night before at Cecil's. "The world tour," says Michael, who's feeling just fine a year after heart surgery laid him low. 
Since entertainment at the Pearl veers from jazz to alt. rock to DJ dance music, the second anniversary weekend also includes a Friday night party with DJ Danny and Zanapod.

More jazz? Are you a player? The Graves hosts another Sunday Open Jazz Jam Session on Dec. 17 (starting at 2 p.m.) with a core trio, Al Macy on piano, Shao Way Wu bass, Simon Lucas drums, and whoever else shows up. (They're looking for vocalists in particular.)

If you're a fan of the Compost Mountain Boys and have been jonesing for the return of their once-a-month bluegrass-Thursday at Humboldt Brews, well this is it. They're back Dec. 13. 
Friday at Humboldt Brews, it's a new band, Humboldt Buds (new name anyway) with the master guitar jammer Rubin Diaz, his old friend from Tunesmiths Tim Stretton on keys and a rhythm section with Marty Holland on bass, and Mike Meyers on drums.<p>
Saturday Humboldt Brews jumps to another genre with a show featuring the fine local world beat/hip hop/funk fusion band WoMama with special guests Bloco Frimeza adding a spicy taste of samba.
I got a couple of reminders about that show, one from WoMama frontman Jesse Jonathon and another from Bloco drummer Melody Walker. Melody was worried that I was "offended by [her] uppityness" last week re: the trouble at Muddy's (I wasn't) and says she's resigned to an end to music at Muddy's. "Now I'm trying to think of more creative long-term solutions to the ultimate problem of a lack of venues (esp. all-ages) in Arcata, and where the hell the Menstruals will wander along to now." And she wanted me to know about her senior recital this Thursday at Fulkerson Recital Hall (at 5 p.m.). "I'm doing a mix of classical art song and opera, and South Indian classical, plus a pre-looped presentation of Meredith Monk's "Panda Chant II". In the second half of the recital I will be joined by AkaBella and then Bloco Firmeza to do some folkloric singing and playing." Eclectic enough for you?.

Anna Banana Hamilton celebrates her 60th birthday Saturday at the Riverwood Inn singing and rabble rousing with her band, The Wild Cattahoulas, named for a breed of dogs that interbred with wolves.

Along with an announcement of Saturday's show at the Mateel, The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (see calendar section for details), the Mateel sent along a teaser for next year's events, among them a Feb. 8, blast of psychedelic wildness from George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic. Tickets are on sale now.

Now that The Common Vice have moved from 19th century rock opera, bandleader Lord Brett Baily (of Que La fame) is celebrating the release of a Victorian Modesty as Performed by The Common Vice CD with a gala event at the Jambalaya Friday night (post-Arts! Arcata). They invite you to "party like it's 1899." And as noted on the poster, "In addition to their gracious performance you will be astounded by the musical delights of the stately gentlemen of Strix Vega." Sounds delightful.
The Rubberneckers count down continues: Friday's show at Big Pete's is their third to last performance ever. (Didn't Led Zeppelin say they'd never perform again 27 years ago?) Joining the 'Neckers for the show at Pete's is Ghostwriter, aka Steve Schecter, a country blues/punk songwriter from Oregon/Texas. I dig his song "People," from a recent album he did with Boxcar Satan. It's a bit scary however as he growls, "People. You can't live with 'em and you just can't kill 'em 'less you want to go to prison."
<p>
Saturday night's show at the Alibi is the last rock thing there until next year. What with this being the year of the Portland invasion, it features a doom-psyche-metal trio from the City of Roses called Paranaut along with locals Dragged by Horses. The Arcata rockers have a new album in the can. Deep in the Woods is due out on Chicago's High Wheel Records (home of Walking Bicycles) on Feb. 5, and no, it's not a new CD  it will be pressed on 180g vinyl (that's heavy) and released as an MP3 collection. (For preview tracks check the DbH MySpace.)<p>

The Vista continues its role as home of all ages punk and/or metal with a four-band show Thursday including This Moment In Black History from Cleveland, Kill The Switch, Sick Bitch, and Instant Asshole (mostly tending toward punk). Saturday they have a more metallic lineup with Slaughterbox, Conducting From The Grave, Killgasm, Fate and Dungeon Master. In between (on Friday) it's something slightly different, a show featuring SHIM from Seattle, a band with a neo-classic rock sound and vocals that are sung rather than shouted. There's a bit of grunge in there, a touch of metal, kind of garage rocky, but not lo-fi. Since no one goes to shows without a local opener (or so I'm told) the earthy Arcata/Manila-folk/punk quartet Henpecker is also on the bill. (Not that they are not worthy in their own right.) 
<p>
It's the time of year for Xmas parties. The Metro is having theirs at Six Rivers Sunday, Dec. 16, and inviting friends and supporters. Gini (the owner) notes, "Our three in-house Djs: Itchie Fingaz, DJ Red and Masta Shredda will all take turns on the tables and battle for the title of best DJ. (They've been talking about doing this since they were all hired.) God only knows what they'll come up with to play, but no matter what it's gonna be fun!" Hey, isn't that what the holidaze are all about? <p>

And as Little Jimmy from Henpecker says, "Merry Max Consumerism!" (Be careful with those credit cards.)

<p>
Iceage Cobra are known in and around Seattle for being rock purists.  Always growing tighter as a band with each show, these guys are sure to inspire fist-pumpin' and drink-spillin' all over the place.  And with "Brilliant Ideas from Amazing People", their debut full-length, released on Seattle-indie Heavy Soul Records, they plan to extend their reach and get people all over the U.S. talking up their ferocious, sweaty brand of rock.
<p>
<p>Here's a bit more information on the band Iceage Cobra. The name alone evokes the sort of bent creativity and tongue-in-cheek self confidence you might hope to find in a new band, but it doesn't tell you everything you need to know... Iceage Cobra came roaring into Seattle from Spokane, WA like the other Northwest rock greats from outta nowhere. Melvins, Malfunkshun, Nirvana... Iceage Cobra. They don't grow this kinda stuff in the big city. Small towns often breed the bands that start modern revolutions - and Iceage Cobra has what it takes to incite a movement. Iceage Cobra could never have existed before now. Their influences span the decades before them, but their popular live show is far from being a retro revue. It's a blast of youth and rhythm and charisma and humor and overdriven riffs - an irresistible rock n' roll gumbo with fat chunks of soul that get stuck in your teeth and follow you home. Iceage Cobra. Revolution. Rock n' Roll. Soul.
<p>
One of the more entertaining new bands in Seattle, Iceage Cobra bring the rock in a big way with a high-energy mix of garage-rock, punk, metal, and  even a bit of rap, powered by gonzo guitar riffs, multiple time changes, and  ass-shaking beats.² - Don Yates, Music Director KEXP 90.3
<p>
". . . shamelessly spastic blend of classic rock riffage, '70s soul, and dance-inducing backbeats" -Hannah Levin, The Stranger

Thanks to the generous financial support of a collection of concerned community members who are underwriting expenses on these events without risk to MCC and for the full benefit of the Mateel, it is possible to present this Season even given the community centers current financial and staffing status.  Still a work in progress, many confirmed events are already on tap for 2008 and will offer a diverse array of arts and entertainment that is both local and world-renown. A sampling of these events includes:
<p>

I remember the first night he invited Andrea Zvaleko onto the stage with him for a few numbers to close out the night, and I was riveted to my seat watching the duo beautifully blend their voices together.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Beverly Ritz's new CD, By Rowdy Creek, is piano music that takes the listener on a journey through the wiles of wildlife nestled next to the Pacific.  The point of my music is to create tranquility, to help people find peace, Ritz explains.   According to fans, this music is soothing, reminding them of another time when popular music was dominated by composers like Mancini and Jobim, and creating an ambience that is hopeful and serene.  Composer/pianist Jessica Williams exclaims, I love what I am hearing.  Youre playing with passion and heart, and its just beautiful!

 

Critics, other jazz artists, and the 40 plus radio stations -- all over the world -- that are playing Ritzs  music agree.    Its a harmonious pairing between  jazz  and nature, writes Heidi Drockelman of Indie-Music.com.   Tim Merritt,  jazz record producer, says Ritz sounds like McCoy Tyner and Marian McPartland.

 

By Rowdy Creek  could be the ultimate palette of  music for dreaming.  Pianist/composer George Kahn elucidates in his review on www.cdbaby.com/cd/beverlyritz2, "You can feel the stream, and see the redwoods towering overhead.  Very much in the style of George Winston, Ms. Ritz delivers a beautiful set of evocative solo piano pieces..." 

 

Since the release of By Rowdy Creek, Beverly has performed in two notable events in Brookings, Oregon, (a few miles up the road from Rowdy Creek).   In December of 2006, she worked in a jazz festival with world-class sax player, Paul Biondi, and his band (including Buster B. Jones on guitar).  Then, in March of 2007, she played piano in the concert given by Tower of Powers Mick Gillette.    

 

Ritzs performances have graced jazz clubs, cultural centers, educational facilities, and many a dinner table at top-notch country clubs. She has also played at senior centers where her tunes have been known to work wonders.  One performance was powerful enough to rouse a man who was suffering from Alzheimers out of his silent isolation. Beverly reports, Now he calls and asks when Im coming back!  I think music touches people in a way that nothing else does. And I would like to follow my music around the world, reaching as many people as I can.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">[Thursday, April 26, 2007.  Redway, CA.]  The request made by the Mateel Community Center to have the courts intervene in a timely manner to stop the take over by Tom Dimmick and People Productions of our twenty-three year old fundraising event Reggae on the River has been denied today.  The courts ruling explains that it cannot establish at this time that a monetary settlement made on the merits of the lawsuit, once that lawsuit has been heard in court, will not successfully mitigate the losses the community center will suffer because of the coordinated actions of the private landowner and the previous production company, People Productions.

It is the Mateels position that it will ultimately prevail in the lawsuit and that the referee will rule that the Mateel has a right to hold its event per Mr. Dimmicks original promise to the Mateel when we entered that contract.  It is furthermore the position that the Mateel is the only applicant under the conditional use permit and remains the only applicant until it no longer has a right to possess the property or assigns the permit to another.  Until then, the Commission should only be dealing with the Mateel as the applicant.  Continuing to treat Mr. Dimmick as an alternate applicant only exacerbates the confusion and frustrates the Mateel in trying to protect the communitys asset from being turned over to the hands of private individuals for their own private commercial gain.

The Mateel will continue to fight the hijacking of our equipment, records, infrastructure, intellectual property and investment, made by this community for over twenty-three years, by private individuals wishing to reap the gain.  We will discuss the current circumstances with our members on May 7th at 6:00 PM at the Mateel Community Hall in Redway.  Until then we hope to see our community at the Thursday, May 3, 2007 planning commission meeting to help us ensure the Mateel permit stays with Reggae on the River.

Coco was a SoHummer back then, one of the guys who helped build the Mateel. He's been living in Eureka for a few years, for reasons I needn't go into here, but he's always been a constant at Reggae, one of many hardworking volunteers who do what's needed: haul garbage, recycling, whatever, always with a warm smile. I just talked with Coco for a little while -- it was a difficult thing for him to do. He's been diagnosed with throat cancer, a serious bummer and, no, he doesn't have health insurance. What he wanted me to know was that he has a way to bring together the dueling forces down SoHum way: The Coco Benefit.

REGGAE on the River Victory on Control of Festival Permit
REGGAE on the River moves forward to save event for local community
<p>
[Humboldt County, CA  May 4, 2007]
<p>
The Humboldt Planning Commissioners held steady in their support for the community last evening by confirming through actions, that the Mateel Community Center is still the applicant and holder of the permit for this years festival.  We appreciate the planning commission taking the action necessary to maintain the integrity of the decision making process to help guide the community through this controversy. said Boots Hughston of 2b1 Multimedia, the producer for Reggae on the River.  This clears the way for the Mateel, owners of the festival-- for over twenty three years, and its production partner, 2b1 Multimedia to successfully confirm its right to produce the festival this year and beyond.
 <p>
The festival is a crucial part of the social and economic goodwill for the local Southern Humboldt community, a community which has much pride in their support over the years for building and maintaining a healthy nonprofit sector in a rural area with limited governmental services.  For over twenty-three years the Mateel Community Center has used their largest fundraiser to distribute the goodwill of the festival by developing diverse cultural arts, theater, and music programs for the surrounding communities.  Programming includes items like the Mateel Meal for those without resources and acclaimed theatrical performances by local youth through Recycled Youth.  
 <p>
Taunya Stapp, Executive Director of the Mateel Community Center said, We are grateful to the commission and acknowledge the difficulty of the job, the changes requested, and we are fully up to the task.  We have taken their words to heart and we hope to have any remaining issues resolved prior to the deadline set with the Mateel and Reggae on the River prevailing. 
<p>
2b1 Multimedia has an excellent reputation and track record for safe large festival events.  The Mateel is very appreciative of 2b1s support and continued willingness to assist in this years production. The Mateel commends 2b1 Multimedia for stepping up to ensure this festival stays with its community and music roots.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">It may be obvious if you follow this music column, I'm a sucker for Gypsy-ish violins, accordions, café music, retro-Euro stuff and for mixers and mergers who leapfrog genres. That said, I love Portland's 3 Leg Torso, who touch all of the above to craft a sound that defies categorization.
<p>
From the title of the band's most recent album, Astor in Paris, I'd initially guessed that the concept might be something like tango nuevo master Astor Piazzolla teaming with the Hot Club of Paris. 
<p>
Not exactly, according to accordionist Courtney Von Drehle, who explained that the album was named for a tune on the record. "For that tune, I imagined what it would be like if Astor Piazzolla were born in France, and played nuevo musette or something lie that." 
<p>
In the beginning the band was a trio with Courtney on accordion, violinist/trumpeter Béla Balogh, and a cellist. Courtney and Béla had been playing together in Lobe, an "art rock" band, up until 1996. "We had learned some Eastern European tunes," said Courtney, "and I convinced Béla we should go out busking."
<p>
Truth is, if 3 Leg Torso reminded me of any bands I've heard, it would be the street bands that played for tips at various points on our Italian vacation. (The guys were relieved that I was not reminded of Borat.) 
<p>
"I didn't really want to force our music on strangers," said Béla, but in a moment of weakness he agreed. For some reason while arranging the gigs, the guys would adopt faux accents in imitation on Béla's Hungarian grandmother. 
<p>
"I'd call and say, 'Hello, meester,' and we'd go out. We'd dress in hokey clothing..." said Béla.
<p>
"And we'd use those accents whenever we'd talk with people," interjected Courtney. 
<p>
"So we called it meestering," Béla noted.
<p>
Courtney continued, "It did have some Borat elements although this was way before Borat, and sometimes people would press us asking, 'Where are you from?'" 
<p>
"Ve are not from here," concluded Béla.<p>

They may not be from here, but 3 Leg Torso is coming here -- for a show at the Jambalaya on Tuesday, June 12. Be there. I will.

It's a grey drippy morning, doesn't really feel like summer (and technically it's still spring), but for nightclubs that rely on the college crowd, the post-graduation summer lull is kicking in. Humboldt Brews is closed until August, using the slow time for a remodel. Others are curtailing their hours. The Red Fox Tavern for example, is only open weekends except for special occasions. (There's one this week and we'll get to it.) It may not be summer-related, but Sacred Grounds is closing for good after one more week. Having said all that, there's plenty going on this week.
<p>
We'll start with Sacred Grounds, but first a correction: When I mentioned the pending closure in recent column, I suggested that former barista Deric Mendes (the talented musician who starred in the Hedwig thing) might be looking for other employment. Well, the day that Hum hit the street, I bought some books from Deric at Northtown Books, where he'd just started working. Without really complaining, he let me know that he has not worked at Sacred Grounds since last year.
<p>
Sacred Grounds has at least one more show, an all ages Placebo thing on Friday (early) with a couple of cool out-of-town bands. I caught Kickball last time they played Sacred Grounds and loved them. They're a bouncy alt. pop combo from Olympia with that Olympian kind of sound (and a great drummer) who suggest, "be your own fucking rainbow." They recently toured Europe with a French band, clara clara, who are now over here touring with them. That one's a trio: keys/drums/bass, with a semi-crunchy dance-friendly sound or as they put it, "Une basse, une batterie et un bontempi leur suffisent à distiller une noise bordélique et ma foi étonnamment dansante." 
<p>
As noted above, the Red Fox Tavern is closed most of the week this summer (Sundays through Wednesdays) except for special occasions, and this Monday's show is truly special. Anyone who pays attention to country music has heard of The Tennessee Three, typically used as a suffix, as in: Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Three. Actually, in the very beginning it was the Tennessee Two, which was guitarist Luther Perkins and bassman Marshall Grant. Drummer W.S. Holland joined in 1960 making Three. Luther died in a fire in 1968, just before Johnny got his own network TV show and hit his second wind. Guitarist Bob Wootton took Luther's place, and that was the Cash band until Marshall left in 1980. Bob and W.S. were with Johnny until he died in 2003 (not long before they were supposed to play Arcata BTW). Today's "Three" still includes W.S. Holland on drums and Bob Wootton on guitar -- with help from Bob's wife Vicky Wootton on rhythm guitar and vocals, their daughter Scarlett on vocals, and Lisa Horngren on upright bass and vocals. The five of them play Johnny's material and some of their own including a song, You Walked Tall, which has gotten some airplay of late. Guess who it's about. The Rubberneckers open the show, and I imagine they're jazzed about it. 
Despite the student exodus, the café closest to campus, Muddy's Hot Cup, has an almost full schedule. This week it's improv comedy benefiting the Shakespeare company Shake the Bard on Thursday, Feminasti DJ Blancatron spinning house Friday (she's also at the Alibi Sunday), Rooster McClintock getting all twangy and shit on Saturday with Jay Dirt opening, Scatter the Mud's Celtic session Sunday, the usual Wandering Menstruals Monday and a songwriter night on Wednesday with Gregory Alan Isakov, Reed Foehl and Curtis Thompson from Kulica. Wait, what about the Tuesday jazz thing with Susie and Shao Way? That's moving to Thursdays.
<p>
What local musician do you suppose has had the most national (and international) press in recent months? My educated guess says it's Saint John Hunt, leader of the blues/rock outfit St. John and the Sinners, who play Friday at the Red Fox, and twice Saturday: at the veteran's North Coast Stand Down and at Blue Lake Casino. And no, he's not in the papers because of the band. It's because he knows who killed JFK, or at least he knows what his dad told him -- his dad being E. Howard Hunt, "a 27-year career CIA executive officer and covert operative most well-known his role in the Watergate affair," as St. John puts it on his website (www.saintjohnhunt.com), where you can buy his book, Bond of Secrecy, and a DVD interview revealing some big secrets. Not having heard the Sinners yet, I'm not sure what secrets are concealed or revealed in their music.
<p>
The Redwood Run is the ticket for power-packed rock/blues this weekend with Gregg Allman, Joe Bonamassa, Joan Jett and Molly Hatchet among those playing for bikers and just plain music fans down in Piercy.
<p>
You may have heard that young blues guitar ripper Corby Yates has taken up residency somewhere east of here out Highway 299. He's on the coast Friday and Saturday shredding at Cher-Ae Heights. (On second thought, is he still considered young?)<p>

My favorite local shredders Dragged by Horses get heavy at the Alibi Saturday, joined by Santa Cruz psyche rockers, El Sonido, who describe their crashing sound as "liquid."
<p>
Jazzy/jammy guitarist Will Bernard plays that same night (Saturday) at the Red Fox. I signed up for Will's e-list at some show long ago and since have followed his rise in the jam world gigging with the heavies, Stanton Moore, Robert Walter, Lonnie Smith, John Medeski, guys like that. For this show he's fronting his own band, Motherbug. Should be good.
<p>
You'd think the Reggae biz would calm down, but it hasn't. I ran into Mateel board member Bob Stern at the Summer Arts Fest Saturday and asked him what's up with Reggae on the River vs. Reggae Rising. "They're going to try to put on a festival; we're going to try to stop them," is how he put it. Next salvos will be heard at the Planning Commish this Thursday.
<p>
The latest: Mateel supporters calling for boycotts of any nonprofit planning on having a booth at Reggae Rising. And how do you boycott a nonprofit anyway? Maybe when your house is on fire you don't call the local VFD? Sorry if this sounds like a broken record, but how about a little peace in the neighborhood?

Whild in the Streets
 <p>
Whild Peach guitarist David Whild wasn't quite sure what the band was doing in Bozeman, Montana. "We're further and further from home everyday," he said when I called him at a Bozeman motel. Home is Atlanta, Georgia, and has been since Whild and his musical partner Peach moved there from Dallas in 1994. "The thing we did in Dallas, we were called Deep Elem, it was an original thing with our own songs, just totally alternative anything. At that time there was nobody doing what we was doing and we ran into a lot of resistance, people who didn't understand a black band playing this alternative rock funk kind of thing. It was funky, but didn't fit any certain category."<p>
Whatever it was, someone at Capital Records liked it and the label brought the band to Georgia -- unfortunately the deal went south before there was a record in the can. "They had some changes, staff shakeups," said Whild, "so we got out of our deal, but we stayed in Atlanta."<p>
The timing was right. While west coast and east coast hip hop factions still ruled, the dirty south was on the rise and Atlanta was at the heart of things with producers cranking out hits. "We started playing around town and evolved more toward hip hop and people started asking us to do sessions and that kind of thing. That's how we hooked up with Organized Noize and The Dungeon Family, then Goodie Mob and Outkast. We ended up playing on their records, writing with them and singing and touring. Once Outkast started going on tours and doing all these TV shows and going around the world, that took up two years at least, so we didn't do anything as Whild Peach for a while." <p>
Whild and Peach worked with André Benjamin (aka Dre) and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton of Outkast from their second album on, a whirlwind period that culminated in the 2004 double-disc, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which sold 5 million copies, and became the first rap album to win a Grammy as Album of the Year. It also marked a transition point for Outkast.
"Once Speakerboxxx/ Love Below came out Dre didn't really want to tour," said Whild, "so we had to do our own thing. That's when we started gigging again. And here we are out on the road." <p>
The road brings Whild Peach to Eureka this Thursday, June 14, to play some slunky music at Red Fox Tavern. If soul/funk/rock is what you're into you should check it.

The second year of Jazz In June At Benbow Inn begins this weekend. In some ways it's a direct descendent of something called the Rites of Spring Jazz Festival, put together almost three decades ago by the Backwoods Jazz Association, a group SoHum jazz fans and players. That evolved into Jazz on the Lake, a big event at Benbow that fell by the wayside a few years back.<p>
"Last year the idea came back. John Porter asked about seeing Jazz on the Lake revived," said Jim Wilde, who works by day as accountant for the Benbow Inn and plays jazz guitar at nights, at least when there's somewhere to play. Needless to say, Jazz on the Lake was good for business at Benbow. Plans were hatched, and a major headliner was lined up, then the Backwoods Jazz folks got cold feet. No one was ready to put up the required cash. Instead, Wilde explained, "We decided to do music on the patio instead." It went well and this year it's back with two almost solid weeks in June and more to come in August. <p>
Wilde handled the booking. "I just called my favorite people, they all said, 'Heck yeah,'" said the guitar player. Things kick off Saturday, June 16, with guitarist Bruce Forman leading a trio including scatting bassist with Kristin Korb and veteran drummer Joe La Barbera. The jazz keeps rolling Sunday, June 17, with the Sheldon Brown Quintet featuring Brown on sax and clarinet and guitarist Dave MacNab. <p>
Tuesday, June 19, it's SoHum's own Humboldt Time with Wilde on guitar, Michael Curran on drums, Geoff Daugherty on bass, Jimmy Durchslag on trombone and Sam Maez on trumpet. 
The Sam Maez Quartet plays Wednesday, June 20, that's Humboldt Time minus the trombone, then next Thursday, June 21, catch the latest incarnation of Equinox, a combo drawing on Backwoods Jazz members, formed to open a Jazz on the Lake show years ago, which includes all of Humboldt Time plus Francis Vanek and Les Scher on saxophones. The jazz series continues every night except Mondays through the end of June. Wilde recommends reservations since some shows will sell out. Call the Inn for details. <p>
Things are looking up for the building at 47 West 3rd Street, home of Synapsis, Empire Squared, and The Placebo. Plans are afoot to bring the currently shuttered warehouse up to code so it can once again become a performance space, and the city seems to be going along with their ideas. They take the plans to the planning commission some time this summer. Of course the work is going to cost money, thus the benefit this Friday, June 15, at 321 Coffee, something they're calling an "Instant Art Show" with a crew of artists creating (and selling) work on the spot while DJ Raj spins arty music. Bring cash so you can take some art home.<p>
Live music in Fieldbrook? That's right, the Fieldbrook Store begins a summer series this Friday, June 15, with those ubiquitous youngsters Steel Toed Slippers. Next Friday, June 22, is open mic night, Wrangletown plays old timey June 29, and there's more to come.
Saturday is the annual Arcata Bay Oyster Festival on the plaza with too many mollusks, and music by those ragin' Cajuns The Bayous Swamis, bluesman Earl Thomas (who is also singing at Holy Trinity Church on Sunday; see calendar for details) and Kulica. The always-groovy Kulica also plays Friday night at Red Fox Tavern opening for ekoostik hookah a relatively venerable jamband out of Ohio (15 plus years old) with the usual mix of psychedelic rock, blues, funk, jazz and bluegrass. The band is at the Fox for a two night run with local reggae rockers Mobile Chiefing Unit opening Saturday night. 
Alert all Scandinavian Celtic rock fans: Your favorite band, Tempest, is playing Saturday night at the Blue Lake Casino's Sapphire Palace -- for free.<p>
Apple Barner from Gold Beach offer "cow-tipping, sheep-poking funk" Saturday at Six Rivers. They explain that growing up on the extreme southwest coast of Oregon in the shadow of the Siskiyou Mountains meant, "There is no underlying regional musical style such as those found in the Deep South, farm country, or the inner-city. It's kind of a no-man's land down here. The rest of Oregon forgets about us, and we don't belong to northern California. We just do our own thing." The result is music that they promise, "is somewhat based on reality or a form of it," including, "some songs you might find you even like."<p>
Norm from Bad Kitty Productions is at it again, this time bringing Detroit-based psychobilly/gothabilly madmen the Koffin Kats to the Boiler Room Sunday, June 17. Wear black. 
With all due respect to KHUM-FM, the only local commercial station I tune in regularly, I have to say that the "radio without the rules" slogan is pretty much a relative thing. The deejays abide by less rules than most, but there's always the FCC regulations to think of and the potential fine for saying fuck or shit or some other arbitrarily banned word is huge. The pirates of the Humboldt Free Radio Alliance on the other hand ignore all rules. Fuck that. Since the low-power broadcasters at 99.9-FM don't have pledge drives like public stations, they throw the occasional benefit, typically at the Alibi, like the one Saturday night with renegade hillbilly Jay Dirt and Henpecker, who are either an anti-war folk punk band, an anti-folk war punk band or an anti-funk polka band, allegedly from Manila, but in truth from all over the map. Wherever they're from they're funny. Support your local pirates and be there.

It would seem unlikely that this kid from Hawthorne, Calif.

But the two would soon listen to and be influenced by one anothers work  with admiration and envy. Wilson had admitted to have repeatedly listened to Rubber Soul, upon its release in 1965, finding it mind-blowing. In turn, McCartney was astounded by Pet Sounds, a record that would eventually prove to be a milestone in contemporary music history.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>The Hum 7/5 - The Fire This Time </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">The Jamaicans are coming! You're thinking, what's new about that? Humboldt is a dread zone, a reggae magnet, and musicians from Kingston, JA. and thereabouts come through constantly. But this contingent is a bit larger than most with almost two dozen musicians and singers from JA. coming in for two shows: in SoHum Friday, July 6, at the Mateel, a CD release for Be Yourself, the debut disc by Joseph Shepard, and a second NoHum show Saturday, July 7, at the Eureka Muni: "the First Annual Humboldt Humble Jam" with Capleton and many others, billed as "the first time outside of Jamaica [that] Judgement Yard and David House will be on the same stage."
<p>
What exactly does that mean? Well, Judgement Yard is a compound/recording studio in the August Town, a rough section of Kingston, home to the dancehall vocalist Sizzla. The young dancehall artist Joseph Shepherd lives there, as do Congo Judah, Bobo David, and dub plate producer John Marcus -- all of them record for Sizzla and all are performing at both shows. David House is home to the JA-based dancehall star, Capleton, aka "The Prophet," who is coming here with his Prophecy Band and an artist known as Jah Thunder.<p>

If the names sound kind of biblical, it's no mistake. All of them are Rastafarians, and most of them follow the path of the Bobo Ashanti, "the Priestly Order of Rastafari," whose members adhere to strict religious guidelines and typically wear their dreadlocks wrapped in turbans.
<p>
You might remember the last time Capleton was scheduled to play locally, a Fall 2004 show at Humboldt State that stirred controversy and was ultimately cancelled. Along with Sizzla, Beenie Man and five other Jamaican artists, Capleton had been accused of advocating violence against homosexuals through his lyrics and placed on a blacklist by the gay rights group OutRage! as part of its "Stop Murder Music" campaign.  
<p>
Capleton is known as "The Fiyah Man" for his tendency to call down biblical fire and brimstone on sinners of all sorts. Asked about the OutRage! allegations before the 2004 show, he claimed he was basically misunderstood. "When Capleton say `burn' or when Capleton say `more fire,' it's not on a destructive level," he told me. "It's not saying to go out there and kill no one or murder people or destroy people. This fire is all about the purification of humanity and the uplifting of the people."
<p>
The Murder Music campaign was fairly successful, resulting in the cancellation of numerous concerts, in fact most of Capleton's 2004 tour, along with many shows by other targeted performers. OutRage! estimates income losses for the various blacklisted reggae artists at upwards of $5 million. But all of that is over as of June 13, at least for some on the list. 
<p>
A press release from OutRage! declares, "Three of the world's top reggae/dancehall singers have renounced homophobia and condemned violence against lesbians and gay men." It goes on to explain that Capleton, Sizzla and Beenie Man have signed something called "the Reggae Compassionate Act" in a deal between top reggae promoters and Stop Murder Music activists.
<p>
Said OutRage leader Peter Tatchell, The singers' rejection of homophobia and sexism is an important milestone. We rejoice at their new commitment to music without prejudice.
<p>
The pledge reads in part: "We, as artists, are committed to a holistic and healthy existence in the world, and to respect to the utmost the human and natural world. We pledge that our music will continue to contribute positively to the world dialogue on peace, respect and justice for all. To this end, we agree to not make statements or perform songs that incite hatred or violence against anyone from any community."<p>

While signing puts an end to the campaign against the three artists, Outrage! is still asking for boycotts for others who did not sign: Elephant Man, TOK, Bounty Killa, Vybz Kartel and Buju Banton. The overall effect of all this on reggae in general is hard to judge. 
<p>
Warren Smith, the concert promoter who put on the recent Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, says he has seen a contraction in the reggae audience in recent years. He blames this at least in part on "fundamentalist Bobo types" who have become dancehall staples.
<p>
"All of I sudden I realized these people have more in common with George Bush than they do with me," said Smith. "They're fundamentalist Christians. They're very sexist towards women. They're anti-gay." As a result, he figures, "The younger generations are not embracing [reggae] like they used to. There's been a negative reaction to the whole stance on gays... and the fact that some of these artists take a Bible on stage and start quoting from it. It's no longer the cool music, and I think we're starting to feel that in the business... I really think the Rasta thing has run its course."
<p>
Will this alleged anti-Rasta reaction take hold in Humboldt? It's doubtful. This is still dread country. An on-again-off-again concert at the Mateel last Sept. featuring Buju Banton sold out easily, and truth be told, when Capleton speaks of "fiyah," locals are more likely to think of lighting their spliffs than of hellfire.
<p>

The Mad River Festival rolls on out in Blue Lake heading inexorably toward the Humboldt Folklife Fest, which starts July 15. (The Journal is some sort of media sponsor.) A few things this week might put you in the mood. First there's a film, Lomax: The Songhunter, playing at the Morris Graves Museum Thursday, July 5. It details the life of Alan Lomax, an influential figure in the history of folk music, the son of musicologist/folklorist John Lomax, and like his father a collector of songs. Patrick Cleary of the Humboldt Folklife Society leads a discussion following the film.<p>

Then on Friday, July 6, the Mad River Fest presents the first of three "Bands Out Back" concerts in the Rooney Amphitheater, with Blue Lake-based groove/folk/rock band Kulica on the stage out back behind the old Oddfellows Hall that houses Dell'Arte. 
<p>
Saturday the Band Out Back is an ad hoc combo called The Greenhorns assembled by the continually amazing Gregg Moore to play original music he composed as a live soundtrack for the great Buster Keaton comedy The General, a tale of a man who loves his train and is willing to go through hell to save it (which come to think of it fits right in with this week's cover story). Fred Belénger, Chris Larson, Susie Laraine, Julie Froblom and Dell'Arte's resident sound designer Tim Gray complete the Greenhorns band. BTW, if you saw Tartuffe, Gregg was the multi-instrumentalist wearing the extremely floppy hat. He also plays Portuguese folk-inspired jazz as part of the festival's Acoustic Jazz Night Wednesday, July 18.
<p>
Meanwhile Saturday, back at the Graves, it's Arts Alive! night featuring a Folklife Festival Preview with Circle Time music by Lisa Monet, songs by Melody Walker (featured on Folklife's Songwriter's Night, July 17) and neo-old timey tunes by Old Dog. (Lisa and Old Dog both play at Folklife's All Day Free Festival July 21.) 
<p>
Big Pete's Pizza in Northtown celebrates its 2nd anniversary on July 5 (has it really been that long?) with a jam session including members of Moo-Got-2, Bump Foundation and (Little) Pete's band, Nucleus. No cover, happy hour all night. Sounds like a blast.
<p>
Got a note from an old friend, Coleman who moved up to the Snoqualmie Valley in Washington a few years ago. The former guitarist/bassman for now-defunct Humboldt County bands like The Yowling Zygotes and The Cow Persuaders is coming back for a show at Muddy's Hot Cup Saturday, July 7, with the acoustic trio, Ask Sophie, which also includes Snoqualmie cohorts Joe Burgener on harp and Cal Christensen on percussion playing eclectic folk, Americana and old country music, "leaning toward songs that tell stories of outlaws, criminals, outcasts, and misfits." They share the bill with a new band, No Not Yet, which includes Coleman's friend Peggy Martinez.
<p>
A missive from (Rutabaga) Queen Monica notes, "In case you are mentioning Los Olvidados in the Hum for this week, you might like to know that they'll be playing live at 1 p.m. Saturday, in the KSLG studio. I caught them last year sometime, at the Alibi, and adored them." 
<p>
Well I was thinking of mentioning the band from Moorpark (down in Ventura County), in part because I like the classic Luis Buñuel film they borrowed their name from. After visiting their MySpace, I now know that they're a slightly folky, somewhat moody rock band with a classic SoCal flavor, as if the music of The Eagles, The Heartbreakers and The Burrito Bros, was somehow genetically imprinted on them. A bio on another site (purevolume.com/losolividados) tells me that the main players have known each other basically forever, or at least since they played in little league together. "flash forward about 10 years. two film students were bored after their old band faded out. the quiet one wrote a few songs and asked the other to help flesh them out with some of the [queen] latifah flavor we all once knew. the two began rehearsing and playing shows and (unwisely?) stole their name from a buñuel film knowing it would confuse a few and most likely be unpronounceable to most. they are not the forgotten." Jay Dirt opens the show for them at the Alibi Saturday night many hours after they play on the radio. Don't forget.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">It was one of those parties. A wild one. My friend Gregg was moving out of a ramshackle place in Blue Lake into classier digs elsewhere and had a backyard bash to celebrate. Gregg has definite pyromaniacal tendencies and included a flaming limbo dance as part of the affair, followed by fireworks and a bonfire to dispose of leftover firewood and scrap lumber around the yard. My job was to keep the festivities festive by providing a soundtrack using an old school record player set up on the porch of the back shed (and by old school I mean one with a built-in speaker that came from a school). Flipping through boxes of LPs in the shed I dug out songs with a fire theme: "Fire," both the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and the Jimi Hendrix versions, Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" and others. Someone asked Gregg if they could burn his wooden ladder. He agreed. When I put on Social Distortion's cover of Cash's classic the revelers began something akin to a mosh circle around the fire pit. Some of the crazier partiers had stripped to nothing but their boots. A few naked crazies climbed up and over the ladder until it collapsed into the flames and someone literally "fell into a burning ring of fire."
<p>
The memory of that night came back when I heard that legendary O.C. punks Social Distortion are coming to the Eureka Municipal Auditorium Saturday, July 14. That's what the band's music is like. Led by the intense Mike Ness, Social D was part of the late '70s wave of Cali punk alongside bands like Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys and Bad Religion. 
<p>
Comrades have fallen by the wayside, but, with a few breaks for rehab and the like, Ness has been at it ever since. At 45, the thoroughly tattooed guitarist is no longer a young punk, but that didn't keep him off his skateboard, and last year he fell off and broke his arm rendering him unable to play guitar. No worries: His friends stepped in as the band continued touring, first Ron Emory from TSOL, then Bryan Small from another fiery punk outfit The Hangmen. They've just released a new EP, The Hangmen In the City, produced by Ness and they're part of the current Social D tour. Also on the bill at the Muni: The Heart Attacks, a "scuzz rock" five-piece from Atlanta described by lead singer Chase as "a gang of pirate gypsy crackhead smart-mouthed snot-nosed rock & roll misfits."

Meanwhile across town, it's The 5 Browns, who could be described as a classical novelty act. The family band, two brothers and three sisters, all play piano and all of them are pretty good. What's novel is they all play at the same time. That's right, five pianos on stage at once. They do some duo numbers and solos, but the main deal is pounding out warhorses from the classical repertoire all together on five Steinway grand pianos. What occurred to me was the fact that there probably are not five concert-ready Steinway grands in the county. No problem, the Browns travel with a truckload of them and will bring them to the Arkley Center Saturday evening.<p>

Vocalese jazzman Bill Allison leads Redwood Jazz Voices in their first performance Thursday, July 12, at Muddy's Hot Cup with Dave Wilson on bass and Mike LaBolle on percussion.

"All kids who grew up in households with pro musicians," Bill points out, adding, "They're all in tune to it."

Seattle nerdcore semi-star Matt Kenall used to call his one-man-band Capital Steps, but the similarly named comedy troupe complained, so now he calls himself Square Wail. He's at the Jambalaya that same Thursday on his "I'm Not Listening" tour playing loopy dance tunes he creates with a pile of gadgets, but mostly with a Nintendo Gameboy. No, really. Dj[hexWarrior] opens, playing out for the first time.

Friday at the Jam, it's yet another band from Portland, Wooden Nickle, a trio with guitars, drums and a laptop who craft cool, dark, haunted alt. folk/rock/country songs intermittently spiked with guitar feedback, hand claps and digital trickery. Deejay Jen Savage offers a preview on KSLG that afternoon at 1 p.m. Locals Laden Swallow open the show at the Jam with songs from their Awaken CD.

Percussionist Jesse Jonathon is the music guy out there, renting rehearsal space for some of the worldly bands he's in: WoMama, Afromassive, Dun Dun Fare, the Janky Mallets and Bloco Firmeza. The Arts! Arcata gallery opening that evening features sharp sculptures by Seth Magnusen and pix by photographer Christopher Cook including shots of various local bands. The music? "We're starting with a local songwriter, Rebekah Downey, then the jazz trio Weather Machine, then WoMama and The Janky Mallets ending midnight-ish. It's all a fundraiser for the building," says Jonathan, promising, "It's gonna be fun."

If you've been following the Synapsis/Empire Squared saga, you know it's actually going pretty well. Says Carmen Olson, the sexy Synapsis trapeze artist/stilt walker, "It looks like we're going to get the Conditional Use Permit we're applying for, so soon we'll do the fire exits and ADA compliance stuff required, and then we reopen. We have an architect working for us, John Ash, he's top notch. He read about it in the paper and called us to volunteer his time. He's drawing up the plans, then we'll have an idea how much we'll need. We're hoping to get a grant from the Humboldt Are Foundation, but in the meantime we're trying to get some money together." 
To that end, they're reviving Tsirkus Picaresque as Tsirkus Burlesque for a cabaret-style show Saturday, July 14, at the Dancenter in Arcata's Old Creamery. "It starts at 8:30 with a fire show and silent art auction," says Carmen, "then they'll be a burlesquey-style circus show. Between acts we'll auction off more art live. We'll have trapeze, fabric aerials, hula hooping, a clowning striptease, and other stuff. DJ-dancing after. It's kind of risqu&#65533; so it's adults only."<p>
It's got to be bittersweet. Yer Dog's long-awaited CD release party at the Alibi Saturday is also the band's last show ever. "We'll be playing with The Ravens which should be loads of fun," says Pete. "We're encouraging everyone coming out to dress in the best formal wear, suits, tuxes, evening gowns... recreating a ballroom dance party." Don't know if that's possible in the confines of the Alibi, but it sounds different.

Meanwhile at Muddy's Hot Cup, it's 8traC, an alt. funk outfit from Boulder with stunning blonde vocalist Chantel Mead out front and guitar work and samples from Derek VanScoten who came through town a few years back with a funk trio called Element37. (Think he likes names with numbers?) Same night at Mazzotti's: jazzy electro-acoustic jams by the Eric McFadden Trio with Eric McF supplying flamenco/Hendrix-inspired guitar riffs backed by stand-up bass and drums.

As you perhaps read elsewhere in this paper, it's Blues by the Bay weekend. If you listened to "The South Side," Chas Lewis' blues show on KHSU last Friday night, you got a taste of some of the artists who will be playing. You would have heard more this week, except the show will not be on. Chas is the radio name for KHSU's longtime development director Charles Horn, and he was summarily dismissed from his position Monday. The man who's described by colleagues as "the glue that holds the station together," won't even be allowed to volunteer as a deejay. Don't be surprised if things come a bit unglued at KHSU in the coming weeks as they struggle to fill his shoes. Good luck, both to Chas and those at the station.

Last weekend the bands played music to a packed house way out in the middle of, well, way past Willow Creek in a little bar called Simon Legree's.
<p>
At the end of the night, still serving drinks to a packed house, Simon Legree's bartender, Ceasar, decided to pay the band $50 less than they agreed to be paid for the night.<p>

<p>
Hey, fifty bicks will pay for a bit of gas to get the band out of your dive.<p>
I decided to call a member of the Doctor Squid band to see if they had any dealings with the notorious bar owners at Simon Legree's.<p>
Bobby Martinez, drummer for Dr Squid, was more than happy to tell us a story about the seedy bar.<p>
"Ceasar invited us to play during a summer night last year. We were happy to make the hour and a half drive out to middle of nowhere to play for folks. We figured that people way out there probably didn't get to hear a live band very often, so we were happy to make the drive and play music for an evening".<p>
But Martinez added "at the end of the night they knocked a hundred bucks off our original agreement for pay. I had to go to the guys and break the news. It's no fun when musicians have to play for next to nothing. I'll never play there again".<p>
Kevin Held, keyboardist for the Roadmasters, agrees. <p>
"I love playing music, but, hey, fifty bucks will get me home after the gig!"<p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Back in the days when my main income came from restaurant work, the sound system of choice in the kitchen was a food-encrusted boom-box, typically with auto-reverse so the music would play on when things got going and the stoned dishwasher's attention was elsewhere. I turned one such dishy into a reggae fan starting with a homemade cassette of UB40 with their hit album Labour of Love on one side, the other a mix of the band's earlier more politically charged albums, Signing Off and Present Arms, along with a couple of newer faves like "Rat in the Kitchen" (which was something was we actually had). The lilting synth lines and high harmony vocals cut through the clamor of kitchen work and became a dinner shift staple. Sometimes the tape played all night.
<p>
I told him the mythic tale of the British band's founding by mates who'd met in a line at the employment office; the name, UB40, borrowed from the unemployment benefit form filled out when they went on the dole; their instruments purchased with the settlement lead singer Ali Campbell received after a bar fight. As I said, the tape served as an introduction to reggae for my dishwasher, and it did so for many others, as sales in excess of 55 million attest. A couple of decades and 23 albums into their career, the band is still going strong, still speaking up on issues of the day with songs like "Plenty More" and "War Poem," from the most recent album, Who You Fighting For.
<p>
UB40's '80s Britpop take on Jamaican reggae is not exactly roots stylee, but it has the feel and the consciousness of classic reggae, and the band has always drawn heavily on reggae's past in their repertoire mixing covers of favorite Jamaican tunes with originals. "Red Red Wine," UB40's biggest hit stateside, was in fact, a cover of a cover, although the band did not know it when they recorded it; they'd only heard the version by the Jamaican singer Tony Tribe and didn't realize Tony borrowed it from Neil Diamond.
<p>
Speaking of covers, the band is seeking to distance itself from a copyright dispute involving heiress and media darling Paris Hilton. You may have missed it, but Paris released a record last year with a single, "Stars Are Blind," whose melody sounds a whole lot like an old UB40 hit, "Kingston Town." Here's the deal: While it's more than likely that whoever borrowed the tune heard it on the UB40 record, it's not their dispute since theirs was a cover and they hold no copyright claim. Following media reports that the band was suing Paris, an official press release was issued stating, "UB40 are in no way associated or party to any legal action being bought against Ms. Hilton in relation to the song 'Kingston Town.' Any speculated legal action taking place against Ms. Hilton would be entirely at the instigation of the original songwriters music publisher." The statement went on to add, "However, UB40 have always acknowledged, respected and supported the rights of songwriters and their vitally important contribution in the musical process."<p>

I imagine there might be some red, red wine on hand when UB40 makes its first Humboldt appearance on Tuesday, August 14, Benbow Lake State Recreation Area. Come early if you want to hear Elan, a Cali reggae singer who did a stint as lead singer for the legendary Wailers.

Need I mention that this concert (which BTW is produced by People Productions) follows pretty closely on the heels of that other big reggae concert down SoHum way? For those who were expecting some sort of Reggae review, well, I had big fun, and the music was great aside from the fact that there was too much of it. (I slept through a couple of sets.) And from what I saw everything was irie production-wise. My saying so will undoubtedly continue to raise the ire of the Reggaetista troll army who now have me pegged as an "embedded reporter," perhaps because I missed the Truth flotilla float-by. Sorry, I was having a good time and lost rack of time. But I'll see you online. (More on Reggae at rotrblog.blogspot.com when I get to it.)

Those who just can't get enough of that one-drop beat have a cupla others options this week: The inimitable Twinkle Brothers are at Mazzotti's Friday with Ishi Dube and Massagana opening.

Another local kid makes good: Tuesday morning Eureka-born "pop soul" singer/songwriter Sara Bareilles sang her hit song "Love Song" on The Today Show and talked with the host about writing "honest" music. The song was given away on iTunes leading to a No. 1 slot on the download site for her Epic album, Little Voice. Check the vid of her Today performance at today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20161429 and you'll find that she does not have a little voice at all, on the contrary. Bigger things are surely coming for Sara, who is 27, so "kid" maybe a misnomer, except for the fact that her proud dad called me when her album came out. The question: When is she coming home to sing? I promise I'll let you know when I find out.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">College is almost back in session; the students are back in town and it's time for another CenterArts season. The local concert juggernaught kicks off a stellar '07-'08 series on Sunday, Aug. 19, with a show at the Van Duzer featuring what is likely the most successful old timey band working today, Old Crow Medicine Show. 
<p>
A video for the band's cover version of the old Stones' tune "Down Home Girl" shows OCMS busking on the street in what seems to be New York City, initially being told to move along by a sympathetic cop who lets on that he likes their music. They dutifully cross the street with their guitars, banjo and standup bass and start again as city life grinds on. At the end an old guy wonders, "Are these the Sex Pistols?" The band does not correct him, answering, "How'd you know?" 
<p>
Now it's not likely you'll see OCMS busking on the Arcata Plaza, but there's a grain of truth in the vid. The band got its start in NYC and played on the street and in dive bars for some time before they got their big break, a mythic meeting with Doc Watson (coming soon to CenterArts BTW) in front of a North Carolina pharmacy that led to a slot on Doc's annual Merlefest (named for his late son, not Mr. Haggard, BTW, although OCMS later toured with that Merle). 
<p>
Moving up in the world they relocated to Nashville and eventually got to play the Grand Ole Opry, which is about as big as it gets in the country scene. A couple of albums and a coupla hundred thousand units later and they're playing all the big festivals, Bonnaroo, Telluride, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage and so on; they're regulars on Prairie Home Companion and CMT is playing their videos. That country-blues take on "Down Home Girl" crossed over to Triple-A radio and won them new fans at home and abroad. 
<p>
After working their way down the West Cost they head for Europe for the fall, returning late Oct. just in time for another visit to the Ryman, home of the Opry, and my guess is they're having a grand ole time.
<p>
If you're thinking of going, you might want to act now. I'm told the show's close to selling out. Tickets are also moving fast for the return engagement by Portland's loungey orchestra Pink Martini (playing Sept. 9), also for blues legend B.B. King (Sept. 11), the Celtic Christmas show (Dec. 14) and especially for the Cirque du Soleil/Pickle Family spin-off Cirque Works in Birdhouse Factory (Sept. 25).

Coming (relatively) soon to CenterArts, jazzy chanteuse Madeleine Peyroux (Aug. 28) funky world music by Zap Mama (Aug. 31), jazz guitar giant John McLaughlin (Sept. 23), Mickey Hart's spacey Planet Drum (Sept. 30), then in one week in Oct. a veritable festival of American music with the above mentioned Doc Watson (Oct. 4), Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby (Oct. 7), Bela Fleck and the Flecktones (Oct. 8) and Solid Blues, a mini-fest in itself with Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, The North Mississippi All-Stars and New Orleans-style pianist Joe Krown (Oct. 10).
<p>
Now the truth is, between the music styles and the prices, the CenterArts season is not really designed for HSU students. Their on-campus musical needs are met more by Associated Students Presents, whose season also opens this coming week with a visit by the funky San Fran Afrobeat band Albino!, playing at the Depot Wednesday, Aug. 22. AS Presents has beaucoup coolness on the horizon including the 7th annual Fall Harvest Festival Sept. 9, with a double dose of neo-old timey: Hot Buttered Rum and Devil Makes Three. Then it's a turntablist's dream with DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist reunited for their Hard Sell tour (Sept. 17) followed immediately by an indie rock one-two with Built to Spill and those old school alt. masters Camper Van Beethoven (Sept. 18). There's still more old timey with the ladies known as Uncle Earl plus local opener Huckleberry Flint (Oct. 16), then (drum roll please) a visit by alt. rock royalty: Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth fame, playing at the Depot of all places (Oct. 26). 
<p>
Coming Thursday to the Indigo Lounge, Peruvian-born "activist rapper" Felipe Coronel aka Immortal Technique. Raised on the mean streets of NYC, I.T. latched on to the political side of hip hop. Classic example: his most famous record, "Bin Laden," produced by DJ Green Lantern with Mos Def making a guest appearance, in which I.T. puts the blame for 9/11 squarely on the shoulders of the Bush admin. (He buys onto the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center.) Diabolic and DJ GI Joe complete the bill.

Seattle's Datura Blues play the Jambalaya Friday night with Washington neighbors, Mindless Thuggs, a band described by D.B.'s Ryan Jones as playing "freeform, droney improv rock" (which might also describe his band). Datura Blues got its start in Arcata in 1999 led by Jones who'd played in rock bands while in high school. Since the turn of the century says Jones, "We've gone from a quieter ambient sound to something more aggressive and rough around the edges. It's what I'd call psyche-rock, a mix of experimental sounds and rock 'n' roll." You might think new roughness came from moving to Seattle, grunge central. Not so, says Jones. "It had more to do with living in Prague. I lived there for a year and worked as a DJ playing fast music all the time. I had never explored that high tempo world in my own music." He's figuring eight Daturas on stage at the Jam Friday, five from Seattle plus a few old friends who are still in town. When the tour ends Jones is following the Dynamite Sweater plan, "Movin' to Portland."

The Felice Brothers are a rough-hewn, honest Americana band from somewhere along the shores of the Hudson River in New York.

Says Presberg, There will be a lot of room for collaborating and jamming."

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Marie Daulne has come a long way since 1990 when she founded Zap Mama as an all-woman a cappella quintet. And it's not just that she's been around the world several times. The Zap Mama sound has evolved from an amalgam of African and European vocal styles to incorporate touches of jazz, hip hop, funk, soul and reggae, creating a polyglot of music and rhythm with Daulne out front. 
<p>
When we spoke on a recent weekday morning Marie was in New York City, far from home, preparing for an American tour in support of her latest album, Supermoon, a cross-country journey that brings her to Arcata on Friday, Aug. 31, for a show at the Van Duzer, then in a few weeks, to Black Oak Ranch near Laytonville, for Earthdance, an event she calls "a psychedelic world," remembering a previous Earthdance performance.
<p>
We started out talking about home. It's a complicated thing for her. Home is Brussels, Belgium, where she was raised, but also in a different way, the Congo where she was born. The transition was not exactly easy. Her Belgian father insisted that her mother take the family away from the political turmoil that was raging in what was then the Belgian Congo. But, she explained, "He did not have a chance to come with us because he was captured. He was a prisoner of the rebels for a while, then they killed him. My mom had escaped with us, the little babies and children, and took us to Belgium." 
<p>
She says memories of her homeland lingered. "When I was around 18, I didn't know why, but I was unconsciously attracted by the sound of the Pygmies. First, I should tell that before they escaped to Belgium, a lot of Belgian people hid themselves in the forest with the Pygmies and the Pygmies protected them. The rebels were afraid of the forest. So my family stayed a while with the Pygmies before we came to Belgium. So when I was 18, my ears were attracted to this sound of the Pygmies. I asked my mother about it, and I wanted to know more about the story of my father, why he was killed and where, so I decided to go back to the Congo, looking for answers about him. What I found was that I must become a musician. The sound of the Pygmies held some deep meaning for me, so when I came back to Belgium I created Zap Mama."

She did not really find exact answers to the questions about her father. "I found that human beings are strange. That's the answer. I found that there are good and bad people everywhere. I grew up straight away at the age of 18, and I knew that nothing is the fault of one person. Yes, sometimes one person can be the cause of a disaster, sure. But why does one man do something wrong? Why does one man kill another? I don't know that there is an answer to that."
<p>
Did she find home? Not really. "You know when I went back to Congo, I thought I would have a welcome like I was part of the family, part of the country, but that was not the case. They treated me like a Belgian come to visit as a tourist. I saw that that is not especially a place to call home. With my family, my husband, my children, the people I love  that is home."

The opening track on Supermoon "1,000 Ways," speaks of a thousand million people with a thousand ways to talk, "a thousand kinds of people, a thousand kinds of deals, a thousand ways to share, a thousand ways to hate and to love. A thousand people die, a thousand ones survive, a thousand ways to feel, to be a human being." And, she concludes, ultimately one must find his or her own way. Marie has found hers in Zap Mama.

Bad Kitty Productions has been bringing crazy rockabilly and the like to various local bars for some time now. This Thursday, Aug. 30, they shift gears slightly to offer a "Psychobilly Doubleheader" at the Manila Community Center for an all ages crowd. The Koffin Kats from Detroit team up with Zombie Ghost Train, a blast of costumed madness from the land down under (specifically Sydney) touring behind a brand new CD, Dealing the Death Card. Bad Kitty's Norm promises, "The band's live show is the perfect blend of charm and horror and is guaranteed to get the crowd swirling."

Fans of the fine bluegrass/gospel outfit, Huckleberry Flint take note. As detailed here once before, fiddler Marybeth Taylor has been living down in S.F., so the band hasn't had many local gigs of late. That said, you may want to make a reservation for dinner at Café Brio this Friday, Aug. 31, where Huck'll be playing outside for sidewalk café diners.

One time Arcata city council candidate Rob Amerman has been telling me about his new band, The Zygoats, for months now, and I had planned to make it to the Jambalaya last Friday for their debut performance and CD release party (how does that work?), which it turned out was also the debut of Ryan's new band, Angel's Share, but  I guess I crashed early. Next chance to see the hard-rockin' Zygoats is Saturday at the Alibi where they share the bill with Hexe, a heavy-duty guitar/drum duo who are working their way down the coast on their way back home to Oakland. 
<p>
New on the reggae (not Reggae) front: The New Jerusalem Band debuts Friday at Mosgo's led by Madi Simmons. "It's roots with conscious lyrics, even some lover's rock," says Madi, who notes that there are two other singers beside him, a woman who goes by the name Omega Fire, and a cat who calls himself Haznebukuk.

Coming Tuesday, Sept. 4, to Six Rivers, The Salvador Santana Band. And yes, Salvador is related to that other Santana, Carlos  he's his son. While he followed dad's footsteps into a music career, he did not take up the guitar he was given when he was five, instead he settled on keyboards. He has an album done, but not yet released. In the meantime he's been working the festival circuit (Bonnaroo, High Sierra) and earlier this year contributed a track to A Song For My Father, a Father's Day album put out by Target stores. The compilation, which also includes cuts by Ky-Mani Marley, Ivan Neville, Devon Allman and others, opens with Carlos' classic, "Evil Ways." 
<p>
Also on Tuesday, at Muddy's Hot Cup, Magnolia Electric Co. on their way south after playing Bumbershoot, the massive Labor Day festival in Seattle. MEC is the current nom de band of Jason Molina, a globetrotting ex-Ohioan who formerly recorded as Songs: Ohia. He's just released the Sojourner box set on Secretly Canadian, an ambitious collection that includes four CDs, all new material, each disc recorded with a different lineup in a different place (including the legendary Sun Studios), plus a tour DVD documenting the sojourner's life on the road, a few postcards and a commemorative medallion. The music? I'd describe it as plaintive, stately folk rock, with shades of Will Oldham, or maybe Neil Young (but with a stronger voice). Jason and Co. are on the road with Golden Boots out of Tucson Ariz., who describe themselves variously at a Goth country band and as a "crumbly western, alt. alt. country band." Fair warning: show up early  Muddy's will fill up for this one, as well it should.

<p>
One-person play grapples with the nature of proof 

<p>
How important is all the stuff? 

<p>
"Losing Things: A Cautionary Tale" wonders whether the habit of collecting might be a way in which a person can attempt to come to grips with nearly dying, the memory of which seems to be dependent upon other means than her own memory. 
<p>

Wendy Butler wrote and performs this one-woman play. John Heckel serves as what he calls an "assistant" in this productions development. 
<p>

The play will be performed on Tuesday, Sept. 18 at 7 p.m. in the meeting room at Humboldt County Library, 1313 Third St., Eureka. 
<p>

Admission is free. The short play will have no intermission. 
<p>

In the play the audience will be introduced to Myrtle, who is intent on collecting everything that might help provide "proof." But, Drea would rather be done with it; there is a question raised as to what length she is determined to go to make it end. The two challenge one another on the importance of what Myrtle considers the "evidence." 

<p>
Wendy herself must mediate between the two. 

<p>
Is resolution possible? 
<p>

Butler, a Eureka resident, has worked as a journalist in Humboldt County for the past decade. She has covered arts and news stories for several local publications, including the Times-Standard, Arcata Eye, McKinleyville Press and North Coast Journal. For several years she was a staff reporter and arts editor with The Humboldt Beacon. She is currently arts editor and news reporter with The Eureka Reporter newspaper. 
<p>

She also produces and hosts the weekly art interview program "Artwaves" for KHSU public radio, based at Humboldt State University.  
<p>

Butler has written and performed original work locally.  

<p>
The plays include "The Light Police" (2000). The multiple-character play was part of Plays-In-Progress "A Voice of Her Own: Celebrating Women in the Theatre," an annual festival dedicated to womens works. It was held at World Premiere Theatre in Eureka. 
<p>

In 2001, Butler partnered with dancer/instructor Bonnie Hossack for "Going Forward," part of the bi-annual "Two Left Feet Dance Project," a festival for writers, dancers and choreographers held at Arcatas Dancenter. 
<p>

In 2003, Butler took part in Humboldt Arts Councils "Saturday Nights at the Morris Graves" performing arts series. She wrote and performed "Light on Eight Tracks," a tribute to her 8-track player/recorder. 

<p>
John Heckel, a retiring longtime theater professor at Humboldt State University has directed a significant number of productions during his tenure with the HSU Department of Theatre, Film and Dance.

EOTO (feat. Michael Travis & Jason Hann of String Cheese Incident) makes Eureka appearance 9/24/2007!! 

<p>

Jason Hann and Michael Travis (percussionist and drummer from the band The String Cheese Incident) make up this brand new 100% improvised live Breakbeat/ House/ Drum n Bass/ Trip Hop project. Drawing from the ethos of some of the great DJ's and computer artists of the world, they use cutting edge technology to create truly original and melodic dance music in the moment, with the undeniable power of live drums. The music is all created on the spot, recorded, then mixed and remixed LIVE to create an ever evolving musical experience. Since the project is 100% improvised, every night promises to be a unique dance experience. Hann and Travis play different roles in this band than in SCI. Jason plays the drum kit, percussion and sampler, while Travis is in charge of the tonal elements, playing bass, guitar, keyboards, as well as hand percussion and live mixing. 

<p>
Michael Travis is a pioneer in the art of modern improvisational jam-rock drumming. He is especially known for his groundbreaking work on playing both hand drums and the drum kit simultaneously. As the drummer for the highly accomplished band, The String Cheese Incident, he has developed a unique style that is very supportive of a free jam aesthetic while still always laying it down. He further develops that approach in EOTO by being super solid to the point of emulating grooves that some of the best programmers and DJs would create, except with that elusive human feel. Travis has played along side some of the worlds greatest drummers while playing with String Cheese including Trilok Gurtu, Babatunde Olatunji, and Bill Kruetzman; & he has collaborated with many other artists including Keller Williams, Karl Denson, Steve Kimock, Warren Haynes, & Bela Fleck. With EOTO, he gets to stretch-out into brand-new territory; Handing over the rhythmic element to Jason, Trav is finally able to test out his melodic chops, playing the electric bass, electric guitar, keyboards, & samplers in addition to his EOTO mini-kit during the duo's spontaneous compositions.  

<p>
Jason Hann is an accomplished composer/percussionist/ drummer who has been playing professionally since the age of 12. Growing up in Miami, Florida, he was exposed early to international music through his father, who is also a musician. Combined with his Colombian heritage through his mom, Jason grew up embracing rhythms from all parts of the globe. Music has taken him around the world, studying first hand in countries such as Mali, Ghana, Haiti, and Korea, both learning and performing folkloric and contemporary music of the land. A dynamic performer, Jason has also produced, composed, recorded, and toured internationally within many different genres of music including Rock, R&B, Pop, Hip Hop/Rap, Jazz, Latin, Latin-Jazz, Flamenco, African, Persian, Electronica, Techno, Brazilian, Indian and other fusions of World music. Other than EOTO, Jason has recently expressed his musical energy through his band, The String Cheese Incident, all of his fellow band members respectful side-projects, as well as other artists such as Loreena McKinnet, Vinx, his solo electronica/ all- percussion recordings, & Jason also continues to hit road with the legendary soul man, Issac Hayes, when possible. With a diverse background of musical collaborations that also include Youssou N'Dour, Keller Williams, Rickie Lee Jones, and Dr. Dre, it is evident Jason has no plans to cease living in the musical moment.

If you are a fan of the blues youll want to make sure that you are in attendance for this ground breaking event.

The North Mississippi All-Stars are a fast-rising, young trio known for their exciting, contemporary take on the blues. New Orleans-style pianist Joe Krown rounds out the show.
The Village Voice called Mavis Staples one of the great female voices. She has become an inspirational force in modern popular culture and music. Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, she received three Grammy® nominations in 2004, a Grammy® Lifetime Achievement Award and 3 W.C. Handy Awards in 2005, and the NEA's National Heritage Fellowship Award in 2006.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">CenterArts presents an evening with Ricky Skaggs & Bruce Hornsby with Kentucky Thunder on Sunday, October 7th at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. Virginia cool meets Kentucky thunder in this unique collaboration between genre-bending pianist Bruce Hornsby and multi-instrumental virtuoso Ricky Skaggs backed up by Skaggs' long-time, hot-shot band. USA Today called their debut album Seriously impressive. Tickets are $65 general, $63 Senior/child, $55 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU, the Works in Eureka/Arcata and The Metro.
<p>
Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby are touring in support of their eponymous debut album which was released earlier this year. The collaboration of country and bluegrass legend Ricky Skaggs with renowned pianist and songwriter (not to mention Virginia native) Bruce Hornsby was described by the Springfield Republican as being one of the most intriguing and imaginative projects either has ever taken on.

<p>

"It's one of the most memorable projects I've ever done," raves Skaggs, and Hornsby agrees: "Ricky Skaggs is a deep musical soul, one of the great keepers of the traditional and mountain music flame. It was so inspiring (and educational) to make this record with these virtuoso musicians. And equally important, I learned a lot about Porter Wagoner and Lester Flatt, and we had a lot of laughs.
<p>
"The cross pollination was a great gift to both of us," continues Skaggs. "Bruce turned me on to his heroes like Bud Powell, Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett... I turned him on to Roscoe Holcomb, Doc Boggs, some old banjo players and singers from the mountains of Kentucky, Carolina, and Tennessee... "
<p>
Backed by Skaggs' ace band Kentucky Thunder, the show will draw from deep roots in mountain music -- adding piano and Hornsby's inimitable songwriting to the core bluegrass lineup of mandolin, guitar, bass, fiddle, and banjo.
<p>
Eleven-time Grammy Award winner Ricky Skaggs is affectionately known as one of bluegrass music's most recognized ambassadors. From his beginnings in bluegrass, he went on to put his own stamp on the mainstream country format, resulting in twelve #1 hits and eight Country Music Association Awards. 1997 marked Ricky Skaggs' triumphant return to bluegrass and the establishment of his own Skaggs Family Records label, which has gone on to break new sales records in the genre. Now in his 36th year as a professional musician, he continues to record and tour with his band Kentucky Thunder as one of music's most sought after live performers. 

<p>
Grammy winner with sales of more than ten million albums to date, for more than two decades Bruce Hornsby has been praised as a virtuoso pianist, singer-songwriter, and band leader. Known as a musicians's musician in addition to his remarkable career as a recording artist, Hornsby has collaborated with artists from Roger Waters and the Grateful Dead to Bob Dylan and Branford Marsalis.

He doesn't lay claim to inventing reggae, but Frederick "Toots" Hibbert says he gave the Jamaican music style it's name. Born in a town called May Ten in the hills far from Kingston, Toots headed for the lights of the city when he was still a teenager. 
As he tells the tale, "I'm from the countryside. I grew up in the church with my parents; dad and mom would preach. I sang in the choir, grew up in that you know. People told me I could be a singer so one day after I become a big young man I got myself to Kingston."
It was the ska era when Toots hit Kingston. As predicted he found work as a singer and put together a vocal group called The Maytals. "My music was a little different because of my voice, because of the sound I have," he recalled. "I can sing R&B, I can sing country, I can sing blues. And I invented the word reggae."
How? "The music was playing in Jamaica for a long time. Then this rhythm come up, this different rhythm. Nobody knew what to call it. People called it different names like 'blue beat' and 'boogie beat.' One day we were sitting around and this word just comes up  reggae  because in Jamaica they would say, if a girl not looking good you call her streggae; if a boy not looking good you call him streggae. It's a nickname, slang for people who don't dress properly. I shortened it a little, said, 'Let's do the reggae.' It was a different vibe." 
The raggedy music called reggae took hold and Toots and the Maytals have been at it for decades, injecting the gospel sound he grew up with to prove that "Reggae Got Soul" as he put it in another song. Ready to feel the Maytals vibe? He's back in Humboldt Thursday, Oct. 4, for a show at the Indigo Lounge.<p>

There's more reggae, plus rock and trance DJS Saturday at Southern Humboldt Community Park. Irie Boogie features assorted Humboldt and Mendo bands including Ishi Dube and Massagana, Self Fulfilling Prophecies, Soulevity and assorted irie DJs.
<p>
The CenterArts concert juggernaut comes on strong this week with four majors shows in the course of a week. First up is folk music icon Doc Watson playing at the Van Duzer Thursday, Oct. 4. The blind flatpicking guitarist with a rich baritone voice broke through nationally during the folk boom of the early '60s after playing the Newport Folk Festival and revived his career in the '70s when the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band enlisted him for their Will the Circle Be Unbroken album. He's been going ever since although he did slow down a bit after his son (and music partner) Merle died in a tractor accident in the '80s. This tour finds him sharing the stage with David Holt, a multi-instrumentalist/storyteller/historian who worked with Doc on his autobiographic 3-CD set, Legacy.<p>

Next up is a Sunday show featuring what might seem an unlikely pairing: jazzy pianist Bruce Hornsby and bluegrass mandolin master Ricky Skaggs. Of course if you know a bit about Hornsby it makes more sense. He was born in Virginia, so the Southern sound is part of him, and he can play with just about anyone. He was with the Grateful Dead for a time and has worked with everyone from Bob Dylan and Bonnie Raitt to Don Henley and Willie Nelson. What will it sound like? Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby, the eponymous album they put out earlier this year, mostly leans toward the country side and they're touring with Ricky' band Kentucky Thunder, so expect jazzy bluegrass, not the other way around.     
<p>
Hornsby has also worked with Béla Fleck, master of the mutant banjo, who returns to the Van Duzer stage Monday with The Flecktones. How do you describe a band led by a banjo player that includes a super-funky bassist like Victor Wooten, Victor's brother, who calls himself Future Man, on a homemade electronic rhythm thing called a drumitar, and a sax/flute player like Jeff Coffin? Well the band's latest album, The Hidden Land, won the 2006 Grammy for Contemporary Jazz, which doesn't quite hit it for me. I asked Béla if "contemporary jazz" is where he sees the band fitting into the musical spectrum. "Well it's funny," he replied. "The genre known as contemporary jazz usually includes music that I wouldn't include myself with, for instance Kenny G, etc. Yet the truth of the words 'contemporary jazz' actually fit the Flecktones music pretty well: We are contemporary and there is a lot of jazz in us."<p>

Last up in the CenterArts blast of American music is a show Wednesday, Oct. 10, at the Van Duzer called Solid Blues. This one is something of a mini-blues fest with a couple of stars who hit the blues scene in the '60s: soulful vocalist Mavis Staples from The Staple Singers (remember ""I'll Take You There" and "Respect Yourself"?) and blues harmonica master Charlie Musselwhite, plus the dynamite country blues trio the North Mississippi All-Stars, who have become darlings of the jamband set, and funky New Orleans-style keyboardist Joe Krown, who played in Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown's band until the bluesman passed in 2005.
<p>
Also in a blues mode: WC Handy Award-winning guitar dynamo Joe Louis Walker and his band The Bosstalkers play at the Riverwood Inn Saturday, Oct. 6.
<p>
Got a note this week from Morgan, the blues-playing mechanic at Redwood Auto who fixed my car a few months back. (It's still running.) He wanted me to know that his band, Black Cat Bone, is playing its first public gig (aside from the Jambalaya blues jam) at Blue Lake Casino's Steelhead Lounge Friday night, sharing the bill with the jammy Papa Bear. The show is sort of a preview of Saturday's Bikes by the Bay at Halverson Park where both bands are playing. (B.C. Bone at 1 p.m., P. Bear at 2:45, a tattoo show in between.) Morgan didn't mention it, but the Bikes by the Bay website calls the band Bad Cat Bone and Donna Landry, so I guess she's their singer. <p>

Something different? Eliyahu and Qadim perform music "inspired by ancient mystical music of the Near East" at Arcata Presbyterian Church Sunday. Bandleader Eliyahu plays a Middle Eastern reed flute called the nay and the bansuri, a bamboo flute from India. The band's name, Qadim, is Arabic and/or Hebrew for 'Eastern wind,' but also 'ancient' and 'that which will come.' It brings together musicians from India and the Middle East to, as the band puts it, "celebrate the common musical and spiritual heritage of the now troubled region's ancient cultures."
<p>
This birthday party invite (of sorts) came via e-mail: "Yes. I'm turning 40 this Friday, Oct. 5th. To celebrate, I will be spinning a free show at Mazzotti's that night. (10 p.m.-2 a.m.) Could you please include this in the calendar please? You could call it "DJ Red's 40th Birthday Bash" or words to that effect. Thank you! - Red." OK, done. No gifts required and please none of those stupid "over the hill" banners or balloons. Party dresses and those little pointy hats are fine however.
<p>
The e-mail subject line put it this way: "Iceage Cobra's bassist leaves band; band continues on with first half of West Coast tour." Despite the fact that the Seattle rockers released their debut album, Brilliant Ideas from Amazing People, earlier this year, bassist Brad Kaufman has called it quits on the eve of a tour. Most of the band's dates have been cancelled, but they're still coming here for two shows, playing Friday at the Vista with Angel's Share and The Zac Institute and Saturday at the Alibi with The Common Vice. Joe Reineke, former lead singer/guitarist of The Meices, is handling bass chores for the semi-aborted tour. After that the band is auditioning for a new bass player. Need a job?
<p>
The Dewayn Brothers play at Jambalaya Saturday? What is a Dewayn Brother? The question is asked and answered on the Kansas band's website. "Well its four brothers and a sister hell bent on pickin fast and partying hard! With rippin banjo, mando, guitar and thumpin bass all we need is the sweet voice of sis Jamie Lee and its a sound and a show youll love to see!" Incidentally, as best as I can tell they're not actually related. 
<p>
It's local alt. night Saturday at Muddy's Hot Cup with Kumsar, Goodwin, Weigand, Jackson and Clark (formerly the little still not big enough) opening for Universalia Jane and the Jet Set and Deric Mendes' new band, Tanuki, with members of Strix Vega and The Lowlights. What's a tanuki? Wikipedia says it's a raccoon/badger-like creature from Japanese folklore, "reputed to be mischievous and jolly, a master of disguise and shapeshifting, but somewhat gullible and absent-minded." <p>

Wednesday, Oct. 10, at Muddy's Hot Cup it's alt. folk by Taarka Duo with David and Enion Tiller, a striped down (no drums) version of "seismic gypsy hypno-grass" trio Taarka. 
<p>
More alt. that same night at the Accident Gallery with locals The Monster Women and Scout Niblett, a minimalist solo artist originally from England who records for Secretly Canadian Records, often with the help of famed producer Steve Albini. Other associates include Magnolia Electric Co. (who were just in town) and Will Oldham, who sings with her on her most recent album, This Fool Can Die Now. This one could be the sleeper show of the week.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Thurston Moore gets ecstatic, plus Ghouls Gone Wild and other All Hallows happenings
<p>

Who is Thurston Moore? As they put it semi-succinctly on the Ecstatic Peace! promo for his latest album, "Thurston Moore, for those of you just visiting planet Earth, has been playing music and liberating whatever ossifying standards rock 'n roll becomes threatened by since the late '70s when he walked the downtown jungle of punk/post-punk/no wave NYC and started the band Sonic Youth. Ever since he and the band have consistently stayed true to the authenticity and creativity of radical rock 'n' roll idealism."
<p>
(For the uninitiated we'll point out that post-punk is just what it sounds like, while "no wave" is the polar opposite of new wave, the music you hear at those ubiquitous '80s night record parties.)
<p>
Moore joined forces with guitarist Lee Renaldo early on. They both played with avant-garde composer Glenn Branca whose drone symphonies with multiple guitars in unusual tunings are often sited as influential on the Sonic sound. 
<p>
Branca's influence and Moore's creative/authentic ethic often spill over into side and solo projects. They are in also evidence in the work by a wild collection of artists released on Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label, among them MV & EE, The Magik Markers and Mouthus, all bands that have played locally this year alongside Humboldt's droning Starving Weirdos. The February show with MV & EE and the Weirdos also included Charalambides, a husband and wife duo with Tom and Christina Carter. I mention this because Christina shows up singing harmony on Thurston's latest album, Trees Outside The Academy, and she's half of yet another E. Peace! duo, Scorces, with Heather Leigh Murray (another Charalambides associate). Scorces is the opening act for Moore's show Friday, Oct. 26, at The Depot (downstairs in the University Center). 
<p>
All of the bands/musicians above, the ever youthful Moore included, are operating outside the mainstream crafting idiosyncratic music that defies easy categorization. Let's just say it's alt. something. 
<p>
It's hard to say exactly what kind of music Thurston might play Friday, but one can guess he'll draw material from Trees Outside The Academy, which is just a month old. It may surprise Sonic Youth fans in that it's not loud, dissonant or shot through with electric guitar feedback. Recorded at the home of J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., it's a collection of songs in the folk vein (well, alt. folk anyway) with violin (Samara Lubelski from MV & EE), rather calm drums (Steve Shelley from S. Youth), and Thurston on acoustic guitars playing music that comes from a place he describes as "the new weird America." Expect a touring outfit that includes Shelley and Lubelski plus Christopher Brokaw (from Codeine) and bassist Matt Heyner. The record has a screech here and there, but mostly it's stuff you might describe as nice, not a word you typically ascribe to the Youth  and no, that's not a bad thing. 
<p>
Halloween proper doesn't come until next Wednesday, but the costumed madness in the clubs and various Halloweeny events start early. There's some sort of list in the calendar, but it seems de rigueur to offer some of the highlights here too.
<p>
Sweet Melody Walker called to say, "The Luscious Ladies are doing a Halloween show at Muddy's next Saturday (Oct. 27). We're calling it 'Ghouls Gone Wild.' It'll be a costume party cabaret ball thing. Halloween repertoire. Of course we ladies will be in crazy sexy costumes; we're encouraging the rest of the crowd to do so as well. We'll have a contest with various categories with awesome prizes. We'll have apple bobbing with organic apples from the Farmers' Market, and we'll have tricks and treats for all the ghouls and boy-eez. It's going to be so spectacular." I'm so glad she didn't use the word spooktacular.
<p>
A Halloween Harvest Costume Ball at the Mattole Grange in Petrolia that night includes Cajun food plus music by Electric Mudd and The Nucleus, all to benefit the Mattole Salmon Group's restoration efforts.
<p>
Latin dance alert: Red Fox's Saturday Halloween Blowout reassembles Humboldt's favorite AfroCuban salsa band, Ponche!
<p>
Also on Saturday, the annual KMUD Halloween Boogie at the Mateel, this year featuring Los Duggans from Echo Park playing what an O.C. deejay describes as "Appalachian/metal/blues/punk, distorted guitars raging with banjo, gut bucket beating along with a modern drum kit." They're on tour with Old Bull, a like-minded political alt. country punk band also from down L.A. way. As usual this is a family event (kids free) with costumes, sweets and all that. 
<p>
That's just the tip of the iceberg for Saturday, check the Music and More listings for costume parties in clubs too numerous to mention. Jumping forward to Wednesday, the real Halloween: You've got murder ballads by the spooky Pine Box Boys at the annual pirate costume party at Six Rivers. There's a Passion show at the Red Fox with stringy jamgrass by The Bucky Walters and Greensky Bluegrass. Moo-Got-2 is throwing a funky Halloween Bash at Muddy's Hot Cup. And last but far from least, the Jambalaya has a Blue Lake invasion, a Halloween Ball with The Brendas, Tainted Zucchini and The Rubberneckers. The three bands are all friends, all are theatrical in nature (The Brendas are always in costume) and what with the various Dell'Artesian connections this should be a wild one.
<p>
You say you don't want to dress up in a costume? There are other things to do. There's the Humboldt Baykeeper Birthday Bash Friday, Oct. 26, at the Arcata Community Center. It starts early with dinner awards, speeches and all that, but you could opt to show up late (and pay much less) just to hear the West African Highlife Band. The Oakland-based outfit is all-star all-African quintet led by Ken Okulolo of Kotoja, who originally came over with King Sunny Ade. There's Nii Armah Hammond from Hedzoleh Soundz out of Ghana and Nigerian guitarist Soji Odukogbe played for years with the late great Fela Anikulapo Kuti. This is the real deal.
<p>
Also on Friday, Mad River Brewing Co. celebrates the annual release of its gold medal-winning seasonal brew, John Barleycorn Ale with a party at the plant in Blue Lake. Expect beer, barbeque and music by Kulica.
<p>
Guitarist Wolf Navarro debuts his latest project  appropriately named the Wolf Navarro Project  on Thursday at Jambalaya. Joining Wolf for some folk jazz fusion are Marcus Messina (from Mobile Chiefing Unit) on keys and guitar, Eric Andrews on bass and Simon Lucas on drums. Watch for a CD coming soon.
<p>
They seem to be 20-somethings; otherwise you might mistake Seattle's The Blakes for one of those obscure jangley psyche-rock garage bands from the '60s you find on a Nuggets compilation. At least that's the feel on their eponymous CD. The fact that they're named for visionary poet William Blake makes me like them even more. Catch them Friday at the Jam (with Zak Institute opening) or earlier that day when they play live on K-Slug.  
<p>
Between the dark themes, growling vocals, monstrous guitars, pounding drums and often twisted imagery, modern metal in its many forms seems perfect for the All Hallows season. It's way before the holiday, but San Francisco stoner rockers Floating Goat and Walken roar Thursday at the Alibi. Saturday the Alibi hosts Portland's Facepilot, who lay down thunderous chords propelled by driving drums, backing your classic distorted roaring Satanic metal vocals. They're on a brief tour with Humboldt's heaviest band, Dragged by Horses. <p>

There's metal plus punk across the Plaza Saturday at Mazzotti's. Rocktoberfest brings together Oceanside punks Pig Champion, Sacto thrashers Awaiting the Apocalypse and locals Entheogen and Forcefed Trauma. 
<p>
Ready to repent? Earl Thomas takes you to church on Sunday singing with the True Gospel Singers at the Arkley Center to raise money for the National AIDS Day Marathon.

<p>
Coming Monday, Oct. 29, to the Jambalaya, mad accordionist Jason Webley on his The Cost of Living CD release tour with several alt. folk bands, Ribbons, Led to Sea and Quilken, whose members also play on Jason's new album.
<p>
Yes, I, reggae moves ever forward, this week with hot Jamaican sing-jay Lutan Fyah, whose dancehall hit "Save The Juvenile" topped the Kingston charts earlier this year. He's at Indigo Friday night, a show presented by 2b1 Multimedia. As you might recall, way back in March Lutan was among the headliners booked by 2b1 for the ill-fated Reggae on the River 2007.  
<p>
Is semi-related news, a note came in over the weekend from former Mateel E.D. Taunya Stapp. It seems her lawyer friend Robert Highley has filed the required papers to renew the Reggae on the River® trademark for 10 more years. Will there be a RotR 2008? Time will tell.
<p>
One more thing, don't forget Snoop Dogg and his posse are at the Muni Thursday, Oct. 25. When I checked before press time there were a few tickets left, but not many. Should be a rager, same with the after party at Indigo. Be there or be square. And don't forget, there ain't nuthin' wrong with being square  if that's your thing.
<p>
FOUND comes to town<p>
It all began with a profanity laced note found tucked under the windshield wiper of Davy Rothbart's car one "cold as fuck" Chicago night in 1999. So it comes as no surprise that the last time Davy was in town, he began his FOUND Magazine reading with the seminal "Page me later" find. Davy read the note with feeling, driving home the irony with a pregnant pause before the p.s.<p>
Mario, I fucking hate you <br>
You said you had to work<br>
then whys your car HERE<br>
at HER place??<br>
Youre a fucking LIAR<br>
I hate you<br>
I fucking hate you<br>
Amber<br>
p.s. Page me later <p>
The fact that Amber mistook Davy's car for Mario's made the note both sad and funny. He shared it with his hipster friends and they too came up with sad/funny/ironic finds: similar notes, off-the-wall photos and other ephemera. Davy and his buddy Jason Bitner assembled them zine-style adding minimal typewritten explanations, initially figuring on just making copies for the contributors. Instead a copy shop employee who must have found it all fascinating gave him an extra 700 copies gratis. The extras were distributed leading to more finds sent Davy's way and a cottage industry was born. 
FOUND Magazine is published not quite annually. There's a website with a new "Find of the Day" posted daily, several books: Found: The Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items, a similarly titled sequel and two photo books, the most recent being Found Polaroids. There are CDs, FOUND greeting cards and an X-rated spin-off mag, Dirty Found, now up to its 3rd edition. 
The recently released FOUND No. 5 is a theme issue focusing on crime related finds, profusely illustrated with mug shots and the like. It goes in unusual directions with some long form finds like the series of letters detailing the often sad FBI career of one Elmer I. Jacobson including a personal reprimand from J. Edgar Hoover over the loss of his service revolver (and a demand for $28.91 to pay for it).  
Then there are the FOUND tours, cross country, even international road trips that find Davy reading all sorts of finds, including some submitted by audience members, with his brother, Peter Rothbart, along to play guitar and sing songs based on FOUND notes.<p>
The FOUND Magazine "There Goes the Neighborhood Tour 2007" with the brothers Rothbart comes to Arcata's Northtown Books (957 H St.) on Saturday, Oct. 27, for a reading/concert at 8 p.m. You'll find FOUND online at www.foundmagazine.com. ~ Bob Doran

   In a world where we face issues that present potential global impact and where our collective consciousness is being pulled in a thousand directions, wheeling in sensory overload and immersed in confusion, there is an overwhelming need for a sense of direction and inspiration toward organic and sustainable alternatives. In the highly saturated music scene of today, Hot Buttered Rum has emerged as one of the leaders of a musical movement toward these organic and sustainable roots.<p>
   With one foot in the door paying homage to traditions of folk, Americana and bluegrass, and the other wildly kicking out in every direction of the musical universe, Hot Buttered Rum is the perfect candidate to lead this evolution.  The band itself, which started on a backpacking adventure, has matured into a national touring act, and is the very embodiment of the terms "organic and sustainable." Their "practice what they preach" mantra has caught on both musically and in the approach to how we define the term, lifestyle.   <p>
   Aaron Redner, Bryan Horne, Erik Yates, Nat Keefe and Zac Matthews are Hot Buttered Rum.  Former schoolmates and long time friends who grew up together in California, Hot Buttered Rum is a way of life for these five virtuosos.   Their sound is as familiar and inviting as it is fresh and original, seamlessly weaving elements of folk, rock, reggae and bluegrass within the fabric of intelligent songwriting.  Their commitment to taking roots music into uncharted territory has not gone unnoticed.  Their newest album, WELL-OILED MACHINE (Harmonized Records), has received glowing accolades from critics and fans, and features bluegrass legends Peter Rowan, Mike Marshall, and Darol Anger.  The songs are laden with hooks, melodies and thought provoking lyrics that can only be described as timeless. This is not necessarily defined as "bluegrass" or even traditional "roots" music, rather HBR is defined as a true synthesis of many genres set free on its own musical course.  Rest assured.  This ship is captained by the best of hands and visionaries who are unafraid of straying out of the norm.  This willingness to explore outside the box, both musically and in their lifestyle choices, has helped create the kind of interest in Hot Buttered Rum, usually reserved for avant-garde composers and entrepreneurs, many years ahead of the rest of the world, coaxing their audience to follow them headlong into the great unknown.  <p>
   On a mission of change and armed with conviction, HBRs legitimacy as a truly unique musical act is only furthered by the band's passionate commitment to using alternative fuels in an effort to lessen their ecological footprint on the environment.   In a world where concern is rising over the value and scarcity of our finite natural resources, it is comforting to know that Hot Buttered Rum is making the effort to lighten their impact while en route to their 150 plus shows they play coast to coast each year.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Hobart Brown Passes </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">FORTUNA, Calif. (AP)  Hobart Brown, a gallery owner and artist who parlayed a bet with a friend over who could build a better human-powered vehicle into a hobby enjoyed worldwide, died Wednesday. He was 74.
<p>
Brown died of pneumonia, said his friend Shaye Harty, president of the nonprofit group that organizes the Kinetic Sculpture Race, a three-day competition co-founded by Brown that features wacky wheeled contraptions.
<p>
The event started in 1969 when Brown turned his son's tricycle into a decorated five-wheeled "Pentacycle" and another local artist challenged him to a race through downtown Ferndale that drew six other participants, Harty said.
<p>
The annual race is 38 miles. Over the years, the tradition expanded to other U.S. cities and as far away as Australia, Harty said.
<p>
Born in Oklahoma on Feb. 27, 1933, Brown moved to Los Angeles as a boy and learned to weld while working as an airplane mechanic. In 1962, he moved to Humboldt County, where he opened Hobart Galleries in Eureka to represent local artists.
<p>
His wire sculptures were shown in museums and collected by Ronald Reagan and Johnny Carson, among others.
<p>
Brown, who suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, retired from racing several years ago and had been in declining health since suffering a stroke in May.

<p>My co-worker Heidi asked me a question at the office the other day, something along the lines of 'Do you know anything about a band from Canada coming to town? I can't remember the name but my friend says they're good.' <p>

'Are they Quebecois?' I wondered. I'd heard about that show. She didn't think that was it. She promised to forward me the e-mail from her friend, Lisa. Subject: "good concert coming your way." It got straight to the point: "hi Heidi - you should see this band when they come to Arcata." 
<p>
What followed was a band list letter from Moira Smiley saying, "Hi everyone! moira smiley & VOCO have shows up & down the West Coast comin' up! Exciting things happening here, and we'll keep you posted when it comes close to you!" 
<p>
A MySpace link followed and an itinerary showing a North Coast jaunt including a show at the venerable Freight and Salvage followed by one on Thursday at the Jambalaya sponsored by Humboldt Folklife. 
<p>
I clicked on the MySpace link and listened to a couple of songs. I liked what I heard. The first, "Dying Californian," begins with a choral group using harmonies a la The Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir, but run backwards. Moira comes in singing a sad song reminiscent of an old Appalachian ballad; before it ends, there's some subtle banjo picking. Subsequent numbers show off a Sweet Honey in the Rock gospel style, almost a cappella, something they call, "post-folk vocal symphonies and dancesongs," with low key bass and mysterious percussion. Moira Smiley provides accordion and banjo; Jess Basta and Christine Enns supply "body percussion"; Jessica Catron cello/electronics; John Ballinger banjo, clarinet and percussion. Everyone sings.<p>
I don't know what it shows, but Luminescent Orchestrii is on their "Friends" list, and I love that band. With that additional recommendation I sent Moira an e-mail with something like a virtual interview. She responded almost immediately.<p>
Who are you? Moira Smiley
<p>
Where are you from? Originally Vermont, now Los Angeles.
<p>
What do you do? Sing, write music, play accordion & banjo, arrange strange old music.<p>

Why do you do what you do? always have - better'n laying carpet, i guess - really, is there any better job than to do what you love?<p>

What are you working on? new songs, arranging old American hymns, writing new body percussion, thinking about clowning...<p>

When will you be here? I'm bringing my band, moira smiley & VOCO to Jambalaya, for a 7:30 p.m. show Thur. Nov. 15th sponsored by Humboldt Folklife Society. We're also going to sing live on KHUM radio at 3:30 that same Thursday!<p>

Who's that? VOCO is my five-piece band doing sweet stompin' rebel harmony soaked in Eastern Europe and Appalachia. Cello, banjo, accordion, percussion and body percussion.
<p>
Whats next? Bartok arrangements of the "Mikrokosmos.
<p>
Anything else you want to add? That's kinda fun - like a quiz! - Moira."
<p>
And I'll add one more thing. There's no Canadian connection; Heidi miss-remembered. The band is from Los Angeles. Don't hold that against them. 
<p>
Pay special note to the start time. Most Jambalaya shows start after dinner; this one is during, and it's one of two separate shows that night. Later on it's one of Humboldt finest hip hop outfits, Subliminal Sabotage. They help close out something called Snow Day, a big too-doo around town that starts with Pro Sport and the Outdoor Store hauling in a whole bunch of snow, and not like when people come back from winter trips out 299 with snow in the back of a pick-up so they can throw snowballs, this is a huge pile, five tons, enough for pro snowboarders to strut their stuff. They call it a "Rail Jam," whatever that is. (I'm sure snowboarders know.) That's in the afternoon on the Plaza. There's also a couple of snowboarding movies at the Minor in the evening, then the "D.C. VIP Afterhours Party" with Sub/Sab ending a wild night at the Jam.  <p>
You might expect the NoHum/SoHum Sub/Sab to be part of Homegrown Hip Hop Vol. 4, Harvest Edition 2007, the all ages thing Saturday at the Mateel, but they're not. Representing the homegrown side are Eureka rappers Nac One and Lil' Sic and crews from Mendo, the funky North Coast Underground from Point Arena, Some of the Truest from Mendocino (the town) and the Mendo Green Team, plus the Humboldt Rockers breakdancers. The headliners are imports: Planet Asia, aka King Medallions (born Jason Green) is from Fresno via San Fran. I'm pretty sure he's not Asian, but Haji Springer is. He's a hyphy-style dude outta Oakland who lays down comical raps often mocking his Indian descent (that's India Indian, not Native American, BTW).<p>
The Mateel is jumping this week. Friday night Linda Tillery and the Cultural Heritage Choir plays for a KMUD/Feet First Dancers run benefit/charity auction for The Igoma Project supporting some sort of clinic in Tanzania. Old timers might remember Tillery from her days with The Loading Zone, a kick-ass blues/soul outfit that played around the Bay Area in the '60s and '70s. Now she's into gospel, again a la Sweet Honey. Tillery calls it "survival music." She explains, "This music, particularly the spirituals, has kept Black people alive through slavery, night rider's raids and segregation. This is the music that has been used as a support for just about every political movement in this country. People take spirituals, reword them and march together in the name of freedom and justice."<p>
Coming up on Tuesday, Nov. 20, at the Mateel, the Mateel Community Center Annual Membership Meeting, which according to the nonprofit's website includes "a 2006 financial report and current state of the organization summary, hall and event review for '06/'07, and a board of directors report along with a community input section, board candidate nominations and more." It was an eventful year for the Mateel, not all of it that good, and the reports should make for an interesting meeting.<p>
Also in the benefit vein: an Arcata House Benefit Dance Party Saturday evening at the Bayside Grange with Cajun music by The Bayou Swamis and eclectic dance music by The Joyce Hough Band. As Joyce points out, this is the first public performance by the band in more than two years, and who knows when you'll get to hear them again. Plus it's a good cause, helping to house families down on their luck. <p>
And there's yet another benefit: A Sunday noontime show with stringy jams by The Bucky Walters supporting the Arcata Educational Farm.

<p>
Remember last week I mentioned the return tour of Capillary Action, the guys who played at the Jambalaya with that crazy Czech band? As noted they're back at the Jam Friday, this time with former Fugazi bassist Joe Lally, who as far as I can tell, now plays solo with bass and laptop. Local support comes from The Rubberneckers, and I'm sad to report, this is going to be one of the band's last shows  ever. A fan list e-mail from Clay tells the tale: "OK kids, here's the scoop. There are [four] 'Neckers' shows left and that be all. Burton is leaving with his family for Thailand on Jan. 6 for an unknown amount of time, and we couldn't consider replacing him. We're playing as much as we can to get in all the rocking and raging that's possible. Then we call it quits. It was fun while it lasted. Get to one/all of these gigs cuz there won't be no more."<p>
That's four gigs to go: Friday at the Jam, a Dec. 14, all ages thing at Big Pete's with Ghostwriter, and two Jan. shows at the Jam. More on them later.
Ready for some holiday cheer? Noonanight Productions presents Pagan Christmas at Arcata's Portuguese Hall Saturday, Nov. 17, with Subliminal Sabotage, Space Cowboys DJs, funk/soul from the Bay by Monophonics, and The Glitch Mob, a crunky alt. hip hop/electronica crew that rips it up. Showtime @ 9, 20 bucks at the door, 21+ only. 
Reggae? How 'bout three shows the same night? Friday Indigo Lounge has Jamaican dancehall from Norrisman, Jah Thunder and Stevie Culture. Meanwhile locals Juce mix reggae and hip hop at Six Rivers, and the Red Fox brings in Cali reggae, a band called Rebelution from Santa Barbara. Saturday at the Red Fox: Soul Majestic, a white dread band from Santa Cruz who played RotR a few years back. Not bad as I recall.
It doesn't sound possible, but a note from Afromassive bassist Aaron Bortz confirms it: The truly massive band will crowd onto the stage of Muddy's Hot Cup Friday night to blast some killer Afrobeat. Last time I saw Afromassive they filled the huge stage at the KBR with a line of horns, many percussionists and some seriously funky dudes from various local outfits, all of them laying into tunes from the Fela Kuti songbook or similar fare creating a really big, really funky sound. Incidentally, this is the second Muddy show that night: Touring Americana-ish songwriters Mike Press (from San Diego) and Jeremy Moses Curtis (from Rhode Island) play earlier.<p>
Also at Muddy's, a Tuesday, Nov. 20, show featuring Scottish singer/guitarist Alasdair Roberts, who plays something you might call alt. Celtic. The roots are evident, but his songs tend toward skewed dirges. He records for Drag City, and has worked with Jason Molina and Will Oldham, facts that mean little to the Celtic folks, but speak volumes to the alt. crowd. Also on the bill, Charalambides, one of those alt. guitar duos that came to town in the past to play with the Starving Weirdos.<p>
Hey, turns out there is a band coming from Canada: Montreal noise rockers AIDS Wolf play a Wednesday, Thanksgiving eve show at the Vista with thelittlestillnotbigenough opening. You can get an idea where A-Wolf is coming from by studying their "9 Principals." The last one: No. 9. "Become the Weird Punks. Remember when punk was weird and when weird was punk. Destroy genre straight jackets and move out of the comfortable. Confrontation with norms and expectations is where the AIDS Wolf family is most at home."

CenterArts presents Circus Oz on Sunday, December 9th at 2 and 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. The hottest show in town, The Sunday Times. Circus Oz delivers a rock n roll, animal free circus is two hours of breathtaking death defying stunts, awe-inspiring acrobatic performances, sparkling comedy and a live band that will leave you begging for more. Not to be missed, Financial Times of London. Tickets are $45 general, $35 Senior/child, $32 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU, the Works in Eureka/Arcata and The Metro.
<p>
Circus Oz was founded in late 1977 as an amalgamation of two already successful Australian groups, Soapbox Circus and the New Circus. The principles that were the heart of the original Circus Oz philosophy are still reflected in their performances today: collective ownership and creation, gender equity, a uniquely Australian signature, and team-work. 
<p>
The founding members of Circus Oz loved the skills and tricks of traditional circus but wanted to make a new sort of show that a contemporary audience could relate to, adding elements of rock'n'roll, popular theatre and satire. They wanted it to be funny, irreverent and spectacular, a celebration of the group as a bunch of multi-skilled individual women and men, rather than a hierarchy of stars. Above all, they didn't want to take themselves too seriously. They sewed and welded together their own circus tent, got together a collection of old trucks and caravans and went on the road. Circus Oz was a fresh and original voice in circus and the company was immediately popular with Australian audiences. Within a few years, they began to tour internationally, with visits to New Guinea and Europe. 
<p>
Since that time Circus Oz has performed in 26 different countries, across five continents to over two million people. They have broken box office records at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and represented Australia at scores of international festivals. They have performed on 42nd Street, at the Tivoli Gardens, in a refugee camp in the West Bank, in indigenous communities in the Australian desert, and in a glass opera house in the Brazilian rainforest. Along the way they have translated parts of the show into scores of languages from Hindi and Japanese to Danish. 
<p>
In the mid-1980s new contemporary circus and physical theatre troupes began to appear across the world, in the wake of Circus Oz. It was at this time that Circus Oz itself underwent a major skills development phase through intensive training with acrobats from China's Nanjing Acrobatic Troupe. Many of the skills learnt over the years from the Chinese, such as pole-climbing and hula-hoop, continue to flavour the show, albeit reinterpreted and presented in a distinctly Circus Oz style. Only one of the founding members still performs with the company, and yet, as new waves of people have joined Circus Oz over the years, they have embraced the company's co-operative style and philosophy and made it their own. 
<p>
The overall tenor of the performance has remained consistent over the years. There are usually eleven to thirteen performers (normally with at least two specialized musicians) who present an intimate spectacle of unrelenting energy, humor, multi-skill playing, surreal imagery, grace, and strength, fully integrated with a live and original musical score. Circus Oz continues at the forefront of international contemporary circus. Its performances today are as distinctive and dynamic as its touring program - the recent critically-acclaimed sell-out season on Broadway being followed by a successful tour of small Australian regional towns. The Circus Oz show is continuously revitalized with the injection of new ideas, skills and people.

Blue Turtle Seduction out of South Lake Tahoe, California has built a concrete fan base over the last four years, solidified by consistent touring. This schedule has allowed for, not only the refining of their live performances, but also their song crafting, adding to their large repertoire of original songs. Blue Turtle's music guarantees to move your feet with rhythms and thought-provoking lyrics that push the limits of its style and genre. 
<p>
BTS' performances celebrate many different levels of live music as the crowd's enthusiasm combines with driving beats and layered lyrics. BTS has broken new ground this year, including playing in front of two sold-out crowds at the San Francisco Fillmore and releasing Deep See Rodeo, their 2nd studio album. The band travels in a 40-foot motor coach that has been outfitted to run on recycled vegetable oil, allowing the use of free, restaurant waste oil, burning much cleaner than traditional fuel. While blazing this trail at such a frenetic pace, BTS will be recording every performance. The results will yield a live release due out in the near future, capturing these musical jewels born from the High Sierra's. The songs tell stories that reflect like emeralds off of Lake Tahoe, the mountain paradise these Turtles call home.<p>

There is no way to slow these Turtles down. Over Halloween weekend, Blue Turtle Seduction hosted the 2nd annual Las Tortugas: Dance of the Dead featuring much of the West coast's top-notch talent and conducted opening duties for Tea Leaf Green in the Southeast. The band will perform at Denver's Quixote's before heading to San Francisco for  their Hitchhikers' Guide to the 12 Galaxies New Year's Eve run. Poke your head in on a BTS show near you and open yourself up, then ask yourself  "have I been seduced?"

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Hillstomp plays January 18th at Jambalaya </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Hillstomp¹s new album, After Two But Before Five, captures the energy of live performance while introducing new songs in Hillstomp¹s growing reportoire of "Bucket¹n¹Slide Rock¹n¹Roll". Recorded on two nights in Eugene & Portland, Oregon, the CD displays the ferocity of their fans and the electricity their live show.
<p>
Drawing heavily from north Mississippi trance blues, a bit from the hills of Appalachia and stealing energy from punkabilly, Portland Oregon duo Hillstomp create a raucous hill country blues stomp with a fiery youth and vigor. It comes clanging and tumbling out of an assortment of vintage mics, buckets, cans and BBQ lids drenched in rambunctious slide guitar.
<p>
<p>
In the spring of 2001, Hillstomp was born in a basement (of course) in Portland, OR. It was the bastard child of Henry Kammerer and John Johnson's mutual need to make music and drink beer. Within a few weeks the Guitar/"Drum" duo played their first open mic to a rousing and slightly scary response. Unfortunately, John's drumset (cardboard box, plastic bucket and Weber grill lid) didn't survive the ordeal, so the pair went back under the basement stairs to build some new drums and practice.
<p>
In June 2002, Hillstomp emerged from the dust and dark with a raucous brand of hill country blues rock stomp. It is a visceral music that makes you want to stomp your feet, shake your butt and love your neighbor. Whether playing original songs, traditionals, or the occasional revamped blues classic, Hillstomp has duct-taped together a distinctive sound that quickly bubbled upward in Portland's roots, blues and alternative-music circles. Their do-it-yourself brand of minimal gothic junkbox blues differs drastically from the 12-bar blues style listened to by your uncle. A whole different approach.
<p>
Following two E.P's, in 2004, Hillstomp revealed their first full-length self-released album One Word to a sold out and nearly rabid crowd at the White Eagle Saloon in Portland. The album was met with favorable reviews from far and wide, and obtained airplay at over 150 radio stations across the USA.
<p>
While Hillstomp toured behind this CD, they found the time to record, The Woman that Ended the World, which was released  in October 2005. The album received rave reviews nationally (Magnet), overseas (UK, Norway & Italy), and debuted at #15 on the USA¹s Roots Airplay chart. Locally, the album was chosen as the Best Local Album of the year by the Willamette Week, (Portland¹s largest weekly) ahead of indie favorites The Decemberists and Sleater-Kinney. The album was also rated Top 50 of 2006 by UK¹s Blues Matters magazine.
<p>
In 2006, Hillstomp was invited overseas where they wowed the crowds at the Open House Blues Festival in Belfast and the Spitz Festival of Blues in London, and in 2007, they performed in Italy. They¹ve been featured on BBC and Italian radio.
Hillstomp continues touring non-stop in the United States: They¹ve developed fanbases in cities up and down the West coast and performed as far east as Detroit. Along the way, they¹ve shared bills with Split Lip Rayfield, Avett Brothers, Scott Biram, Michelle Malone, I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House, Lucero, Two Gallants, and Drag the River, to name a few. They¹ve also showcased their live act on local radio shows across the country including OPB¹s LiveWire.
<p>
Their new release, After Two But Before Five, wails into existence and rumbles into the RL Burnside song, "Goin Down South" with the crowd howling as the show begins. The CD features favorites of Hillstomp¹s past two releases while showcasing new gems like "Dark Clouds a-Risin¹" by Fred McDowell, "Rollin¹ & Tumblin¹" and the shoe-stompin¹ closer "Stewball". You can wait for Hillstomp to come to your town or pick up this CD and slip it into your playerand Hillstomp will never leave your living room again.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Four of the five members of The Lonely H just graduated high school in June of '07 and went on their first ever U.S. tour for two months.  Now they're back at it - and dropped out of college to pursue the rock 'n' roll dream. So they mean it!  And have the sound to back it up.
<p>
Swaddled tight in the electrified buckskin of their classic rock-n-roll forefathers, our five Washington braves set out to blanket America in a hot winter blizzard. Don't be fooled by the silk strands tucked behind their ears: what the maps don't tell you is that all-night drives make for better lives, deer come out of nowhere, and what parents don't know (night after night) won't kill them.
<p>
The Lonely H spent their graduation summer [2007] touring coast-to-coast in support of their new record and got a glimmer of the mission they were born to undertake. Tour is a magical place where every stage, no matter how high, is a new opportunity to deliver the goods. Armed with melodies that sound like letters to Penthouse etched on colored vinyl, the band lifted, lightened, and gave rise to every technical challenge. Bulletins started coming in over the wire from fans and bloggers [MSNBC, The New York Post, CMJ]. So, from Memphis to Manhattan went pockets full of picks, licks, pianos, and the living-loving swagger that has happily intoxicated the Pacific Northwest the last few years.
<p>
Thanks to these starlit marauders, Port Angeles can sometimes sound like the good parts of 1970's Los Angeles depending what Saturday night they're home. Idling the van for a wise fall quarter at the University Of Washington, the H cracked books and fantasized with giddy relief about their soon-to-be-months out on the road in 2008. They can handle it, mama. Not only did they survive the twelfth grade riding ferries to play rock shows on school nights, they simultaneously penned and released two albums with heart and heat to match [Kick Upstairs (2006) and Hair (2007) ­ The Control Group].

Unless you're up to date on the world of contemporary jazz, the names Myra Melford and Marty Ehrilch may not mean much to you. New Yorker magazine included the duo's 2007 release, Spark!, on a short list of the best of the year. Pianist Melford has also earned acclaim for her work with Trio M, where she works with bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Matt Wilson. Saturday, Jan. 26, the always-forward thinking Redwood Jazz Alliance brings both the duo and the trio to Arcata for a show at Fulkerson Recital Hall that will also include a combination of the two, an unnamed quartet with all four M's. 
<p>
Melford called from her Berkeley home to talk about the show, about jazz in general, and the "progressive jazz" she plays. I asked what she thought about the New Yorker review where the music she made with clarinet/saxophone player Ehrilch was described as "thorny."
<p>
"I think of it as quite melodic actually," she said with just a hint of defensiveness. "We use a lot of melodies and harmonic chord progressions and different kinds of grooves. It's not like traditional straight-ahead jazz by any means. But it's using song form a lot. We base out improvisations off of songs that Marty and I each write. And since we have both been influenced by a lot of the more experimental music of the '60s and beyond, our improvisational vocabulary includes that kind of thing the New Yorker refers to as 'thorny,' those kinds of textures or whatever. But I would say it's just that there's a lot of exuberance in the music, a lot of energy. That's how I think about it."
<p>
As Melford noted, the starting point for a new kind of jazz was innovative '60s improvisers like Henry Threadgill, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. I wondered, where is jazz going now?  "It's always going somewhere," she answered. "It's hard to say where. For me? Well, I don't know. I think I'm on this path where I'm always looking for new sounds  that may mean new instruments or new combinations of instruments, new approaches or strategies for improvisation."
<p>
(For more of the conversation with Melford check the North Coast Journal Blogthing at ncjournal.wordpress.com.) <p>

Thursday at Humboldt Brews, catch Del Mar, featuring drummer Bud Gaugh of Sublime fame. Note: The seaside name Del Mar reflects the band's oceanic Dick Dale-style surf sound, not their home base: They're touring out of Reno, this time out on the road with Sacto-based power rock trio SexRat. <p>
Add this to the you-learn-something-new-every-day file. I was at a loss translating the acronym in the p.r. (press release) from HFRA (Humboldt Free Radio Alliance) for a Friday night Alibi show describing Trigger Renegade's music as "NWOBHM-inspired rock." Wikipedia informs me that NWOBHM stands for New Wave of British Heavy Metal, a sound that emerged in the late in the UK, "as a reaction in part to the decline of early heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. The NWOBHM toned down the blues influences of earlier acts, upped the tempo, and adopted a tougher sound, taking a more hardcore approach." The Alibi show also includes The Zygoats playing some sort of post-NWOBHM music.<p>
If you've been to The Works lately you might have seen the petition demanding a reunion of The Hitch, a beloved local metal quartet who have been on a long hiatus. Those who can't wait may want to hit the show at the Alibi Saturday with Machete and Side Iron since each band includes a former Hitch member.
There's definitely a metallic taste in the music of Oakland-based Tempest, who typically describe themselves as a Celtic band. Watch Norwegian front man Lief Sorbye launch into a shredding solo on his double-necked electric mando Saturday at Blue Lake Casino and you'll know his roots are in rock.
Blue Lake groove rockers Kulica are getting back into the gigging swing. Friday at Red Fox Tavern they share the bill with youngsters Steel Toed Slippers, who are gearing up for a big show in February marking their first CD release. More on that later. <p>
Friday at Six Rivers: Hellbound Glory, a band out of Aberdeen Wash. via Reno playing a sort of neo-outlaw country they call "scumbag country" with songs about drinking, drugs, hard livin' ("like a head-on collision") and general rowdiness. As they brag on their MySpace, they are "officially banned from [Reno bar] Shea's Tavern for kickin' over pitchers and raisin' a ruckus."
Also on Friday, a return visit to Calvary Lutheran in Eureka by the young San Francisco Opera Center Singers as part of the ongoing Eureka Chamber Music Series.
More singing Friday at the Jambalaya as assorted rockers go acoustic getting all introspective and singer/songwritery. Well, maybe. Clay Smith from the dear departed Rubberneckers, Bret Bailey from Que La and Common Vice, Brett "the Truck" Schuler from Henpecker and Pete Ciotti from The Nucleus all have a few songs so sing. We'll see how acoustic they keep it. 
The just-mentioned Pete celebrates his 30th birthday Saturday doing what he loves to do, playing drums with The Nucleus. His b-day party at Humboldt Brews also includes a set by gypsy-jammers Absynth Quintet. Earlier in the evening, Ryan Roberts from Absynth will be at Libation with that other gypsy jazz combo, the Tom Toohey Trio. And the night before (Friday), members of both those bands play with the fiddlin' Rob and Joli of Cuckoo's Nest for the Westhaven Center's annual "Django Swing Concert" celebrating Django Reinhardt's birthday. 
It's blues time Saturday at the Jam with "string-twanging" guitarist Catfish Keith, a man who loves his National Reso-Phonic guitars (he's an official dealer) and plays them with relish.<p>
Monday is not typically a big night for music, but this coming Monday, Jan. 28, brings a couple of touring acts to town. At the Jambalaya you have Woven, an ambient electronic rock outfit from L.A. who put out a couple of discs for Interscope. They share the bill with Deric Mendes' band, Tanuki. As Deric explains the band name was chosen because the mythical Japanese creature the tanuki had shapeshifting abilities. From the beginning, that was the plan for the band. "We originally started with acoustic guitar and cello," said Deric, "but we're getting to be more of a rock band. I've gone to electric and added more distortion. Now it's more a Brain Eno-inspired rock band." 
And a last minute addition to the Red Fox calendar brings Def Jux rapper Mr. Lif back to town for a Monday night show also including DJ Choc-Won, J the Sarge and others, for an evening of "industrial polka sprinkled with a wee bit o' bagpipe," according to the promoter, who adds, "it's really hip-hop in case you didn't know."<p>

At the Mateel Friday, Taz presents "Blow Big," a Bay Area hip hop showcase with Indian rapper Haji Springer, Dubee, J-Diggs, Crest Creepaz, Bavgate, The Jacka, Rydah J Clyde, Miami Da Most and others. A bar upstairs for the 21+ crowd benefits the Mateel. <p>

"Most people think of yoga as postures or breathing, but there are so many other kinds, including the Indian classical tradition that I come from, Nada Yoga, the yoga of sound and vibration. Nada Yoga finds a beautiful meeting ground with Bhakti Yoga, which is the yoga of pure love and devotion in the Kirtan. The focus is on becoming aware of our essence and opening the heart."

Speaking of open hearts, my favorite folkrockers, Joanne Rand and the Rhythm of the Open Hearts play Friday at Mosgo's. Ali Nelson opens.
<p>
Reggae? You got it Tuesday at the Red Fox with D.C.-based SoJa mixing in a bit of dub. Humboldt's own Jah Sun opens.
Reggae clash? You've got that too. A note from Dimmick Ranch indicates that the efforts to settle the Mateel v. People Productions/Dimmick Ranch legal dispute out of court have failed. (See reggaeblog.wordpress.com for details.) That means the two sides will lay out their respective cases before an arbitration judge starting Monday, Jan. 28, at 9 a.m. at the Red Lion in Eureka. Proceedings are open to the public. 
Meanwhile, a note comes from People Productions announcing that "Early bird tickets for this years Reggae Rising Music Festival go on sale Thursday, Jan. 24, at 4:20 p.m. on the Reggae Rising website (www.reggaerising.com)." 
Reggae Rising is planned for the first weekend in August, same as lat year, and the same as Reggae on the River before it. According to Mateel board member Garth Epling, the main sticking point in negotiations regarding the lease for Dimmick Ranch was the fact that "the Mateel wants to preserve its ability to put on a local festival using the Reggae on the River name." As a result of the negotiation breakdown, the warring parties seem to be opting for what the Mateel's lawyer, Bill Bragg, describes as "the nuclear option." Well, I guess that's one way to achieve peace.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Mateel Community Center Open For Business </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">With the coming of 2008, after a full staff layoff and 6 months of low power mode, the Mateel Community Center is happy to announce that it is once again open and at your service.  Embarking on a new business plan that seeks to create a sustainable Mateel by emphasizing income through hall rentals, in-house events and festivals, grants, membership, merchandise, and services for hire, back in the office to spearhead this effort are newly rehired staff members, Katz Boose (who will handle administrative and hall rental duties), Justin Crellin (talent and marketing coordinator), and Casandra Taliafero (on merchandise, membership, and special projects).  Also on the team are Gina Guinn (bookkeeper), Heather Parker (hall caretaker), Ashley Wilma (vendor coordinator), and Cathy Miller (sponsorship and ads), who together will cover the full range of hall and office duties with the help of a dedicated collection of volunteers. 
<p>
At the heart of this new plan is expanded use of the hall and a new rental fee structure designed to encourage diverse usage of the space throughout the week.  Weekend for-profit rentals are now offered at $1250 and weekdays are $1000.  Non-profit renters will still receive a subsidized fee of $600 for weekends and $400 on weekdays.  Current interest in the calendar is high, and as much advance notice as possible will allow for the best range of date options, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.  The MCC hall and its commercial kitchen are also available for a price of $50 per hour for those looking to do classes, food preparation, meetings, or low impact events.  <p>
Additionally, the Mateel office will now offer a variety of event related services to accommodate the needs of hall renters.  Among these are discount color printing of posters and brochures, local event marketing services, and a variety of hall and stage configurations to accommodate renter needs.  Call the Mateel office at 923-3368 or send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9af5fcfcf3f9ffdaf7fbeefffff6b4f5e8fd">[email&#160;protected]</a> to express your interest in calendar dates or any of the above services.<p>
Memberships are also still the lifeblood of the organization and, with nearly 300 members already signed up for 2008, it is looking like the goal of 1000 members by the end of the year is well within reach.  New membership categories have been added and the 2008 structure offers an individual membership for $30 ($15 for teens/ seniors), family for $55, business for $100, and lifetime for $1000.  All memberships come with one vote in the board of directors election (family memberships receive two), discounts on Mateel sponsored events and merchandise, monthly event emails, and lots more.  Also look for a big spring membership drive happening soon throughout Humboldt and Mendocino counties.<p>
To become a member or renew your membership in advance of the spring drive please come by the Mateel office.  Business hours are from 10am to 5pm Tuesday through Friday and this is also your one stop shop for MCC gear, tickets to Mateel sponsored events, general information, copier services, or to sign up as a volunteer.  Volunteer energy is always needed at events, for office coverage, at the regular Wednesday work party, and as hall liaisons.  Immediate needs are for responsible people who can commit to one day a week helping with secretarial duties in the office and for people somewhat familiar with the hall to train to act as hall liaisons at various rental events.  <p>
For an overview of how 2008 rentals, classes, and in-house programs are shaping up, please go to www.mateel.org.  You can also visit the new Mateel Community Center myspace page at www.myspace.com/mateelcc and sign up as a friend of MCC.  An in-house event brochure is also available at the Mateel office for those without internet access.  Contact the MCC office at 923-3368 for more info or just drop by and get involved in the great things happening at your Mateel Community Center.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Their time has come at last.  After spending years, even decades, providing some of the greatest backline support New Orleans music has heard, brilliant sidemen George Porter Jr., Russell Batiste Jr., and Brian Stoltz, (Porter Batiste Stoltz) are ready for their close-up.  
<p>
Everyone else who hears Porter Batiste Stoltz believes, too, which is why their fall tour dates, and the prospect of a new album from the group, is reason to get excited. Theres no denying the trios pedigree, and their chops are miles wide and oceans deep.
<p>
The bands debut album, Expanding the Funkin Universe (2005), offered funk, groove, fusion, rock, hyphenated style freakout. The new album promises to feature more focus and less wild-eyed indulgence. Porter explains Weve taken a real step forward in the groove and we learned some things from the first record thats made this next one really special.  Stay tuned for information on the new album release as it becomes available.
<p>

GEORGE PORTER JR. <p>
Few bass players in the history of modern New Orleans music are as storied as George Porter Jr. Back in 1965, Porter joined on with the Meters, considered by many to be the ultimate fusion of rock, funk and R&B, and gained recognition as one of the scenes elite bass players. 
www.georgeporterjr.com	<p>
<p>
RUSSELL BATISTE JR. <p>
As a member of one of Nawlins legendary musical families, Russell Batiste Jr. knows his way around a sound stage. Hes played multiple instruments, and has been at the drum kit since the age of four. Russell joined the Funky Meters in 1989 and, like Porter, has played with a wide variety of performers. <p>

<p>
BRIAN STOLTZ<p>
Brian Stoltzs playing is a perfect fusion of virtuosity, emotion, and instinct, and the combination has helped him to develop a reputation as one of New Orleans most sought after guitar players. Stoltz originally made a name for himself with the Neville Brothers, then later the Funky Meters with Batiste and Porter.  <p>

<p>
He's the master of the psychedelic funk he branded funkadelic, the spacey Captain of the Mothership. With James gone, you could say George Clinton is the funkiest man on Earth. 
The music he made with various iterations of his bands Parliament and Funkadelic was sampled left, right and sideways to become the basis of hip hop. Did he reap the profits? Not yet, but he's working on it. When we talked last week, he detailed the status of his court cases. He has the lawyer from the Hendrix estate working to reassert the rights to his back catalogue and associated royalties. He's won his first case and is awaiting a damage judgment. And when he becomes a millionaire, what's his plan?
"I'll just go around doing shows, having fun funkin," he told me.
Isn't that what you're already doing?
"I'm not going to learn any new habits. I'll just keep funking it up, going fishing, maybe I'll buy me some Viagra."<p>
Just what does that word funk mean to you?<p>
"It's what you do to survive. You do the best you can, then funk it. It's an attitude. You funk it, hang loose. It's the Force. You do the best you can, take some blues and start jammin'  that's funk music. You just get in and jam and get funky. You don't blow your mind about it, you just do the best you can."<p>
 But when you got going at the end of the '60s it seemed like you were all about blowing minds.<p>
"You see it was a positive blow then. You'd get fucked up and it was positive, but then it started becoming literal, and people were thinking they had to be crazy to do this. You got to be in charge of your crazy so whatever you funk up, you're still in control. It's not always easy."<p>
And you have no regrets?<p>
"Nah. I'm having a ball. In the pursuit of happiness, I'm successful. I don't ever want to catch it. The pursuit is what it's about. I'm still going after it."
<p>
Experience George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic in full pursuit Friday, Feb. 8, at the Mateel Community Center. Come dressed to impress: It's also the Mateels Black and Red Ball. Elsewhere on Friday, young rockers Steel Toed Slippers celebrate the release of their first CD, The Mixerfish Album, at Mazzotti's. I have no idea what a mixerfish might be, and what are Steel Toed Slippers anyway? Vocalist Emily Totten is somewhat vague, offering, "besides the name of our band a type of footwear I suppose." Drummer Matt Moss does not go much further saying, "I guess you could say, there are four of them in the whole world." Guitarist Will Nicoll gets deeper, "They're heavy but comfortable, intriguing but accessible and slightly assimilated, ponderable, but solid." Bobby Amirkhan, aka BassFury waxes poetic suggesting, "They're all the rage in Sweden. You may have thought clogs were in fashion there, but don't be fooled by shoe propaganda, they're all about the Steel Toed Slippers over there. But seriously, we're just a group of young and passionate musicians who want to make people think with our music while they dance and rock out." Note: The Mazzotti's show is all ages, so STS' high school classmates are welcome.

How 'bout some alt. hip hop? Head to the Red Fox Friday for a Portland crew including Sleep and Zelly Rock and Jon the Baptist and Peg Leg (of Science Non Fiction). Our own Republican Duck Hunters open. (I'm guessing you can read more about this one in the T-S' Northern Lights, since one of the Hunters is now the editor.)

Has it really only been a year since David Ferney and Jacqueline Dandeneau established the Arcata Playhouse? I guess so. They're celebrating the first anniversary Friday with Clüb Shampoo, a sometimes comic musical review with Lila Nelson, Jeff DeMark, Glasnost Gypsy Band, The Brendas, Joyce Hough and Fred Neighbor and many more. 
<p>
Fans of the Neville Brothers and New Orleans funk in general will want to catch the PBS show Thursday at Red Fox. No, not the TV PBS, this is Porter-Batiste-Stoltz, as in George Porter Jr., bass player from The Meters, drummer Russell Batiste Jr. from The Funky Meters, and Brian Stoltz, guitarist for the Neville Bros.<p>

It's Prom Night Saturday at the Vista. Well, not really, more like a dress-up Valentine show celebrating the return of former locals The Ian Fays, who are making it big (well, bigger) in San Francisco. They share the bill with former bandmate Julia Cupp's fine band The Broken Hearts and another iteration of thelittlestillnotbigenough. Formal wear encouraged. They'll have a photo corner for those who want souvenirs. 
<p>
They're calling Saturday's show at the Pearl Lounge "The Portland Bluegrass Invasion," and the three bands, Whiskey Puppy, Chickweed and Clampit, Gaddis & Buck, are on their way home from the San Francisco Bluegrass & Old Time Festival  but be forewarned: The bands from Oregon are more alt. old timey than straight-ahead bluegrass. For real bluegrass try The Del McCoury Band, who play the night before at HSU (more details in the calendar section) or for the local version, Thursday, Feb. 7, is the Compost Mountain Boys monthly gig at Humboldt Brews. Don't know how it happened, but that day is also the first in a monthly series of first-Thursday-of-the-month Humboldt Folklife Society Bluegrass Jams held at the Freshwater Grange with fiddler Judy Hageman hosting. If it lines up that way every month, y'all might wanna think about moving the Folklife Jam to another night.

After a semi-soft opening, Aunty Mo's kicks in to seven-day mode this week, running noon-2 a.m. daily. DJ Joe-E spins what new owner Justin describes as "totally gay dance music" on Thursdays, former ELFS DJ, Blancatron is there Saturdays and DJ Miyagi takes it back to the '80s Sundays. The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence host a grand opening Mystery Ball Mardi-Gras Masquerade Ball and Coat Drive this Sunday at noon. Bring a coat, sleeping bag or warm blanket for the homeless and you get in for just $2.

It was 10 years ago when San Diego indie rockers Armistead Burwell "Zach" Smith IV (of Three Mile Pilot) and Rob Crow (from Thingy and Heavy Vegetable) joined forces as Pinback.

That changes Monday, Feb. 11, when Pinback hits the Kate Buchanan Room with geek/gangsta rapper Chris Ward IV, aka mc chris.

Blue Cheer's debut album, Vincebus Eruptum, provided the soundtrack for countless high school stoner parties circa 1968. Forty years later the power trio is still playing the psychedelic blues and hard rock that eventually came to be known as heavy metal and/or stoner rock. Local stoner metal band Machete opens for them Monday at Six Rivers.
<p>
Remove all but the drummer and percussionist from the jamband String Cheese Incident, add some synths and looping devices and you get EOTO, (End of Time Observatory). Groove to the burbling rhythms of Michael Travis and Jason Hann Monday at the Red Fox.

Wednesday at the above mentioned Arcata Playhouse, an evening of politically-charged folk with ace songwriter/deep thinker/activist/poet Jim Page, on the road with Citizen Band, who note on their website, "Our guiding vision is simple. We believe that capitalism sucks and there are all these fucking greedy capitalists bent on ruling the world and wreaking destruction on all living things. The fight to change all this is long, hard, and sometimes sickening and laughter is the only medicine that everyone can afford. So we go for laughter in quantity (especially since were not that good at music)."

Feb. 6 is the day Bob Marley was born. There's a touch of irony in the fact that I'll spend much of his birthday in a room at the Red Lion, where warring parties battle over Reggae contracts in front of the grandson of the late Chief Justice Earl Warren. 
<p>
The following Wednesday, Feb. 13, Sonoma-based reggae band Groundation brings its 8th annual Bob Marley Tribute Tour to Humboldt Brews. Special guest for the all-Marley music tour is guitarist, Will Bernard, who is up for a Grammy for his album, Party Hats. Incidentally, the disc features Groundation's drum/bass team Paul Spina and Ryan Newman on several tracks.
<p>
By chance that's also the day for the weekly Wednesday reggae night at Jambalaya featuring One Wise Sound with Aka Boom. And, in an unfortunate bit of counter programming, Wednesday is the day for High Voltage Reggae at Blue Lake Casino's Wave with your hosts Jah Sun and Ishi Dube (I'm told their back-up band is killer). I don't recall which club declared Reggae Wednesdays first. Let's hope it won't take a lawsuit to decide which show survives.
<p>
If you have cable TV and tune it to Access Humboldt Channel 12 this Friday at 10 p.m. you can catch Ishi on the debut of Live with Passion, a local music show hosted by Steve Watts of Passion Presents and a woman described in their p.r. as "the lovely Katie Mae." In the future the bi-weekly show will showcase music by Jah Sun, Moo-Got-2, Subliminal Sabotage and Mobile Chiefing Unit, maybe even the Steve Watts Band. Out on the town Friday night? Catch rebroadcasts Sundays at 11 p.m. and Thursdays at midnight. Live music at home? Now there's a conundrum.

Greg Brown was born in the Hacklebarney section of southeastern Iowa and raised by a family that made words and music a way of life. His seasoned songwriting, storytelling and music are deeply rooted in that place. He moves audiences with warmth, humor, a thundering voice, and his unpretentious musical vision. 
<p>
At 18, Greg won a contest to play an opening set for singer Eric Andersen in Iowa City, who then encouraged him to head east. Moving to New York, Greg landed a job at Gerdes Folk City in the Village running hootenannies. He recorded a couple of albums on his own then began working on A Prairie Home Companion and touring nationally. 
<p>
Gregs music is an intricate mix. Its no wonder  he is an intricate mix of a person. Though a touring musician for over thirty years, he has never abandoned those things that move him deeply  family, home, poetry and the natural world. Music and words flow through him and he uses them to paint simple yet powerful images on a canvas of gospel, blues, country, rock, and jazz.
<p>
Greg formed a long lasting relationship with the Mid-Western record label Redhouse Records and released his sixteenth album with them in 1984 with, Milk of the Moon. In 1992 Greg released Dream Café which was also a huge critical success. The Washington Post called it an unassuming triumph, and in the opinion of Z Magazine, it rivaled Bob Dylans Blood on the Tracks. <p>

1994s The Poet Game saw significant national radio play and earned not only critical raves, but also the Indie award for singer-songwriter Album of the Year. The Live One, released the next year, proved to be a fan favorite capturing the humor, warmth, insights, and spirit of his legendary live shows. 
<p>
Greg continues to stay busy writing, recording and performing, and with the release of his new album The Evening Call, he will be performing at festivals and theaters across North America including a stop in the Van Duzer Theatre on March 8th.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>CENTERARTS PRESENTS LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">
CenterArts presents an evening with Ladysmith Black Mambazo on Sunday, March 2nd, 2008 at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. The historic Paul Simon album Graceland introduced the world to the lush a cappella harmonies of Ladysmith Black Mambazo and catapulted the group to international stardom. Since then, Ladysmith has recorded over 40 albums, establishing themselves as the number one record-selling group from Africa. Tickets are $38 general, $35 Senior/child, $32 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU, the Works in Eureka/Arcata and The Metro. 
<p>

For more than thirty years, Ladysmith Black Mambazo have married the intricate rhythms and harmonies of their native South African musical traditions to the sounds and sentiments of Christian gospel music. The result is a musical and spiritual alchemy that has touched a worldwide audience representing every corner of the religious, cultural and ethnic landscape. Their musical efforts over the past three decades have garnered praise and accolades within the recording industry, but also solidified their identity as a cultural force to be reckoned with.  
<p>

Assembled in the early 1960s in South Africa by Joseph Shabalala  then a young farmboy turned factory worker  the group took the name Ladysmith Black Mambazo  Ladysmith being the name of Shabalalas rural hometown; Black being a reference to oxen, the strongest of all farm animals; and Mambazo being the Zulu word for axe, a symbol of the groups ability to chop down any singing rival who might challenge them. Their collective voices were so tight and their harmonies so polished that they were eventually banned from competitions  although they were welcome to participate strictly as entertainers. 

<p>
In the mid-1980s, Paul Simon visited South Africa and incorporated Black Mambazos rich tenor/alto/bass harmonies into his Graceland album  a landmark 1986 recording that was considered seminal in introducing world music to mainstream audiences. A year later, Simon produced Black Mambazos first U.S. release, Shaka Zulu, which won a Grammy in 1988 for Best Traditional Folk Album. Since then, the group has scored eight more Grammy nominations.  

<p>
In addition to their work with Paul Simon, Ladysmith Black Mambazo has recorded with numerous artists from around the world, including Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton, The Wynans, George Clinton and Ben Harper. In addition, Black Mambazo has been invited to perform at many special occasions. By special invitation from South African President Nelson Mandela, they performed for the Queen of England and the Royal Family at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The group has also performed at two Nobel Peace Prize Ceremonies, a concert for Pope John Paul II in Rome, the South African Presidential inaugurations, the 1996 Summer Olympics and many other special events.  
<p>

The group celebrated twelve years of democracy in the Republic of South Africa with the January 2006 release of Long Walk to Freedom, a collection of twelve new recordings of classic Mambazo songs with numerous special guests, including Melissa Etheridge, Emmylou Harris, Sarah McLachlan and Zap Mama.  
<p>

The newest offering by Ladysmith Black Mambazo is a tribute to Shaka Zulu, the iconic South African warrior who united numerous regional tribes in the late 1800s and became the first king of the Zulu nation. Ilembe: Honoring Shaka Zulu.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>CENTERARTS PRESENTS AN EVENING WITH LEO KOTTKE </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">CenterArts presents an evening with guitar virtuoso Leo Kottke on Friday, April 4, 2008 at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. Acoustic Guitar Magazine called Kottke One of the most creative and influential guitarists of the latter 20th century. More than any other artist, Leo Kottke has defined the role of the contemporary acoustic guitarist as self-styled virtuoso, amassing a worldwide following in the process that first surfaced with his now legendary 1972 recording, Six and Twelve String Guitar. Tickets are $25 general, $25 Senior/child, $20 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU, the Works in Eureka/Arcata and The Metro.

Try and Stop Me, the title of Leo Kottkes most recent album encapsulates the spirit of the man himself  profoundly original, a little cantankerous perhaps, a deep talking Midwestern raconteur whose quick wit is matched by his astounding virtuosity on the six and 12 string guitars. For the past three decades, Kottke has been indefatigable in his pursuit of a unique musical vision that has placed him among the foremost acoustic guitar stylists of our time. 
Longtime Kottke devotees have learned to expect the unexpected.  Try and Stop Me is no exception. It is the most improvisational record the legendary guitarist has ever recorded. Usually a meticulous pre-planner, Kottke threw all preconceived notions to the wind when he entered Studio M near his home in Minneapolis. 

Over time, the importance of improvisation for me has increased, he says. I used to think that it was nothing worth hearing. Among the factors that helped thaw Kottkes longstanding reluctance to jam out was the making of Clone, his 2002 duet record with bassist Mike Gordon of Phish.  

Clone raised the level of risk I was willing to accept, Kottke admits. I didnt know where I was when I went in the studio to make Try and Stop Me.  I wasnt as flummoxed by that sensation as I might have been had I not spent that much time with Mike.
<p>
Kottkes ability to embrace folk idioms and pop melodies as readily as he assimilates jazz and classical influences makes him unique among guitar virtuosi. Over the years, Kottke has worked in the studio and shared concert stages with everyone from songwriters Lyle Lovett, John Fahey, and Rickie Lee Jones, to jazz musicians Paco de Lucia, John McLaughlin and Joe Pass. My music is maybe hard to categorize, Kottke allows. It doesnt fit conveniently into the bins at record stores. That works for me, though... I dont rise and fall with trends. Most listeners seem to have room for this stuff.

A roots reggae celebration in honor of International Womens Day, this special evening will feature two of the genres legendary artists.  Headlining The SoHum Soul Revival will be the one-and-only Judy Mowatt, who will return to Humboldt for her first local performance in more than 10 years.  Known as the international queen of reggae music she has had a long and illustrious career both as a solo artist and as one of Bob Marleys original backing vocalists in the I-Threes.  She recorded 6 classic albums between her 1974 debut, Mellow Mood, and her conversion from Rastafarianism to Christianity in 1995.  Her 1978 release, Black Woman, is one of the genres all-time great albums and also the first to be recorded at Tuff Gong Studios.  She also received a Grammy nomination for her 1985 classic, Working Wonders, and was the genres first female to be honored with this distinction.  While still putting her music to the beat of a solid reggae rhythm, the three albums Judy has recorded since 1995 are pure gospel and truly showcase the depth of her soulful voice in a setting that is equally engaging as her secular work.
<p>

 Opening the show will be the classic Studio One recording artist, Winston Jarrett, for what is sure to be a night of real roots music.  A founding member of the seminal reggae powerhouse, Alton Ellis & The Flames, it is Winstons voice that punctuates these timeless recordings.  He has also been a prolific artist in his own right, with more than 50 years as a professional musician under his belt and over 100  hit releases in Jamaica and England under both his own name and a variety of pseudonyms including Righteous Holmes, The Soul Stars, and T-Man, among others.  <p>


Band support for both Judy Mowatt and Winston Jarrett will be provided by The Demolition Squad, a crack ensemble of top NorCal reggae musicians.  Judys set will be further rounded out with the inclusion of her keyboardist, Othneil Lewis, and a 3-part harmony section also traveling from Jamaica (which features Judys daughter and musical sensation in her own right, Yeshemabeth McGreggor).<p>

MOBILE CHIEFING UNIT <p>www.myspace.com/mcu<p>
Spawned from the creative fertility of the Phish scene - founding members Michael Beck and Jason Miller were longtime employees of the bands philanthropic arm, The Water Wheel Foundation.) <p>
Since joining forces with bass player Ryan Jones in Kalamazoo, MI in the late 90's, Mobile Chiefing Unit has proven themselves as a much needed beacon of positivity in tumultuous political times. Their debut record, Smell the Reggae (2002) was recorded at Western Michigan University Sound Studios and is an uplifting blend of conscious lyrics, driving reggae rhythms , and psychedelic musical exploration. Which quickly made them a staple of the bustling Kalamazoo music scene and landing them a headlining spot the Dunegrass & Blues Festival. <p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Greg Brown's back in town, Cali country from Bartenders Bible
<p>


It's not hard to imagine Iowan folksinger Greg Brown climbing out of a dusty, battered pick-up truck parked down some lonesome road, pulling an equally battered guitar and canvas bag full of fishing tackle from the back and ambling down an overgrown path looking for a hole where they're biting.
<p>

That's the picture he paints in a talking blues number called "Eugene" on his latest album, The Evening Call. As longtime sideman Bo Ramsey picks out a guitar pattern reminiscent of a burbling mountain stream, Brown lays out plans for a fishing trip, working his way through a check list: bamboo rod, hip boots and a book of flies, "Take along my Gibson J-45 made by women during World War II, coffee-stained stack of maps, a little propane stove, a pile of old quilts, can opener, kipper snacks, smoked oysters, gunpowder tea, copper tea pot and a good sharp knife.<p>


"Sometimes you have to go look for your life," he offers, the first of a few flashes of fishing stream philosophy in his gravelly ramble. After a brief harmonica interlude he continues with the plan: <p>


"You know Ill park by some rivers, cook up some rice and beans, read Ferlinghetti out loud, talk to the moon, tell her all my love tales  shes heard them, many times; Ill make up some new juicer parts  drink cold whiskey from a tin cup, sit in a lawn chair, fiddling with my memories, close my eyes and see. Sometimes you gotta go not look for nothing."
<p>

Before he's done he's touched on "the blandification of our whole situation," and world peace while making his way east through Nevada and Utah heading for the Ozarks in search of brook trout and "the sounds old Mother Earth still makes all on her own." You just know he'll find that nothing and it will be something. It's a Zen thing.<p>


Greg Brown and Bo Ramsey are back in town this weekend to play a few songs and telling a few stories on Saturday evening on the stage of the Van Duzer Theater. Expect an opening set from Bo. Sunday morning they hit Hwy. 299 driving on over to Chico. Maybe they'll stop along the way and see if they're biting, maybe not.   
<p>

Call it California country, or alt. country; Bartenders Bible plays cry-in-your-beer music shot through with lap steel and banjo, drawing on twin SoCal traditions: Flying Burrito/Byrds hippie twang rock and Bakersfield outlaw style a la Merle Haggard and Buck Owens. According to B. Bible keyboard player/banjo man Matt Strachota, Gram Parsons and his shrine in Joshua Tree played a role in the band's latest CD, The Rim Rock Recording Sessions. <p>

"We recorded the album at this place out by Joshua Tree called Pioneertown," said Strachota, calling from the band's home base in San Diego. "It was built by Roy Rogers and Gene Autry in the '40s. It has these Old West storefronts where they shot films. Behind the storefronts were bowling alleys and bars. It's still there, but the only thing operational is a restaurant/bar called Pappy and Harriet's Palace. Our bass player Jim bought a place a mile or so away; technically the area is called Rim Rock. It's high desert. We wanted to record out there so we basically just took a studio to Rim Rock and set up in his house. We took Paul Jenkins from Blackheart Procession out there to engineer it. Of course we had to take a little trip out to the Gram Parsons memorial, the place where they burned his body." <p>

The Rim Rock songs speak of broken hearts, lonely truck drivers, hot dry desert days with vultures circling. And yes, you can sense Gram's ashes blowing in the wind. This weekend Bartenders Bible takes to the road heading north. Catch them when they stop for a show at the Pearl Saturday on their way to Washington.
Elsewhere Saturday you have an unusually eclectic collection of concerts spread around the county: the worldly Gamelan X is at Fulkerson Hall (more on that show in the calendar), Irish singer/harpist Annette Griffin and the McBride Irish Dancers playing for a pre-St. Pat's "Best of Ireland" show at the Arkley Center and The Scotia Ragtime Band with music from the ragtime and World War I eras at the Fortuna Monday Club. <p>


The seemingly tireless Pete Ciotti called to say, "Me and Lenny [Pettinelli, aka Nipsy] are releasing our Day Go CD Mangia this weekend. The band name is a play on words being we're both Italian  it's I-talian music done sort of funk style with the wacky Nipsy twist." The Day Go CD release party is Friday at Humboldt Brews with Murdockulous opening.

<p>

And in other Reggae related business, the Mateel Community Center, in association with Friends of Reggae on the River presents The SoHum Soul Revival on Saturday, March 8, at the Mateel. Despite the name, it's not a soul music concert, it's a reggae show in honor of International Womens Day featuring Judy Mowatt, a singer who made her name initially as one of the I-Threes, the backup vocal group for Bob Marley and the Wailers. Judy is bringing her keyboard player and own harmony vocalists, including her daughter Shema (by ex-husband Freddie McGregor), otherwise she'll be backed by The Demolition Squad, a reconfiguration of Hoy Kersh's band Massawa with Hoy's son Shasta Kersh on bass, Brody Forester on guitar and a few Jamaican musicians. The D-Squad will also back co-headliner Winston Jarrett, a Jamaican veteran who was part of Alton Ellis' band The Flames back in the day. Come early for an ital dinner prepared by Sue Moloney.
<p>

You may have heard that the organizers were a bit worried when, right after the event was announced, PG&E announced that the Redway area's power would be shut off for transformer repair work for 12 hours that just happened to fall in the middle of showtime. According to the Mateel staffer Justin Crellin, that problem has been solved. The planned outage has been rescheduled. Crellin also noted that the Friends of the Reggae on the River listed on the posters is a support group for Mateel operations. He emphasized that the show is not raising funds to support the Mateel's lawsuit against Tom Dimmick and People Productions. 
<p>

For those who have not been paying attention, the Reggae suit hearings are on hiatus, at least until St. Patrick's Day. In the meantime there's the annual Reggae-related public hearing before the Humboldt County Planning Commission coming up Thursday, March 6, which includes a review of the annual report for what is officially described as "the 2007 Reggae on the River/Reggae Rising Music Festival." 
<p>

As detailed in the public notice, "The Planning Comm. will be setting the attendance levels for the 2008 event; the applicant is requesting ticket sales be allowed to increase back to the 2006 levels of 12,000, and with the commensurate increase in staff and volunteers, the total number of persons at the event would be 14,400 persons." 
<p>

Judging from what happened at similar commission meetings last year, I'm guessing we might see the ongoing resistance from the Mateel side go public once again. While the Reggae War is on break in the courts, it rages on in SoHum, particularly in the blogosphere, and there's no end in sight. One love? Forget it.

MAD PROFESSOR   <p>http://www.ariwa.com/artists/madprof.htm<p>
On the content of his character, and by the results of his recordings, he is one of the sanest record producers. The name Mad Professor was first given by friends at school, who were amazed by the experiments he carried out as a youth. Having built a radio and telephone system at the age of 10 years, it was no surprise that his interest and subsequent career in electronics along with a love of Motown, Philadelphia International, Treasure Isle and music of all types propelled him onward. The early Eighties, having built his own mixing desk, had launched Mad Professor along with the Ariwa Studio/ label from his front room in Thornton Heath. Early works include sessions with Ruts DC, Reggae Regulars, Merger, Jimmy Lindsay, Mikey Dread, Johnny Clarke and many more international artists. DUB ME CRAZY, the first in a 12 part series of albums, was to become his beacon for the label. With an episode being issued every year, the titles all told a different story. Beyond the Realms of dub  Dub me crazy Pt2, The African Connection  Dub me crazy Pt3, and Dub me crazy Pt 7  Adventures of a dub sampler. The distinct variation and surprising sound effects were unique for this time. Dub, and the cool sound and clarity of his mixing encouraging many artists to the growing label. 
<p>
By the mid - Eighties, the studio / label moved from its launch base of Peckham to Whitehorse Lane, South Norwood where it is still located. At this time he incorporated remix projects for the Orb, 400 Blows, Beats International (Lindy Layton), Sade and Brilliant. A heavy schedule of touring Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Spain Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, USA, Canada and Japan, while still managing to produce the various artists projects was an enormous workload. The label by then had a healthy 104 albums with more in the infancy stage of planning. 
By the mid Nineties, Mad Professors profile increased to legendary status After remixing Massive Attacks second album, Protection. No Protection was instantly received by all corners of the globe, benefiting from Virgin / EMI international launch pad. Professors personal Dub tours were increased to be a major part of his schedule, along with further remixes which include: Clementine, Tracy Spencer, The Boom, Danny Red, Depeche Mode, Jamiroqui, Rancid, KLF, Beastie Boys, Cidade Negra, Perry Farrell (Janes Addiction) along with the Massive Attack dub extravaganza all benefiting from the Mad Professor touch. Production work for various major labels include: Sony Music, EMI, Arista, Warner Brothers, Capitol Record, and Virgin Records. In 1998 the Ariwa record catalogue contained over 155 titles including over 30 dub albums from Mad Professor, 3 albums from U-Roy including the classic True Born African, 7 albums from the Upsetter, Lee Scratch Perry and many classic Lovers Rock albums, including Country Life - Sandra Cross, If I gave my heart - John Mclean, Black with Sugar  Kofi. By the end of the Nineties, Mad Professors Ariwa label gained international notoriety in many territories throughout the world. Mainly known for its Dub, roots and Techno / drum and bass catalogue. 
<p>

THE ITALS <p>  www.myspace.com/theitals<p>
Out of Savana La Mar, Jamaica, Keith Porter and The Itals are some of the toughest, most consistant touring artists in the reggae genre. These minstrels have the drive, perseverance and humility to reach to the farthest outposts, where many of their counterparts never go. For this sacrifice they are duly rewarded with the love and respect of the people. Keith Porter, Kada Porter and David Isaacs are the singers for this vocal trio. Known for their tight harmonies and uplifting songs of glory, these reggae messengers have been going fresh and strong all over the world since the early eighties. After many hard years on the road, they are still youthful and in good health. Keith Porter has proven himself to be one of the strongest men in the business whose endurance is remarkable. Keith never gets weary. The Itals are true samples of the Rasta Philosophy.
March / April 2008, they will be touring North America again. Got to reveal. Got to reveal. Truth that is hid  has got to reveal, chant the Itals. Sing farewell to my enemies. Sing farewell to my enemies  Alphas love is over me. The Itals sing songs to make us remember God and focus on His great blessings to humanity. Just for the gift of hearing, we could never be thankful enough. Temptation is a thing trying to keep me away from Jah glory. I love, I love, I love - Jah glory. When the Itals hit the stage, Jah glory is on.
Long before the Itals were a spark in their producers eye, Keith Porter recorded his first hit single, Hitey Titey, with the Westmorelites on the Studio One label in 1967. Around 1969, Keith became lead singer for a band named Soul Hermit, backed by Eugene Gray and Wignal Henry on guitars, and Reginald Seewell and Nash on base and drums. They played in numerous entertainment sectors of Jamaica until Owen Sinclair put together a new band in 1971.  Called Future Generation, the band was composed of Dalton James and Roy Hilton on drums, Devon Henry on keyboards, Eugene Gray, guitar, Scott on sax, and Keith on vocals. They performed all over Jamaica for X amount of years, singing all styles of music, American R&B and love songs and native Jamaican songs.<p>
Tiring of the club scene around 1975, Keith ran into Ronnie Davis on Orange Street in Kingston and asked him who was auditioning. Ronnie gave him a cassette with a rhythm hed just had a hit on. I was so happy with that rhythm I didnt look any further, says Keith. In less than a week I had written Ina Disa Time and came back to Kingston to record it for Lloyd Campbells SpiderMan label. Lloyd felt it needed some harmonies with my lead, so Ronnie and I both added harmony parts. There was no intention of forming a group called the Itals; the record first came out as Keith Porter. After the song was on its way to becoming a hit in Jamaica, we all went out to do some promotion. Lloyd, Ronnie, myself and Brian Thomas of RJR were sitting out back in the cantina, when Brian said why not call them the Itals, because now there was more than one person singing. Everyone liked that name. It sounded good, so all of a sudden, Itals was a group. It was never intentional. Ive always wondered if the name was the result of Brian noticing how strict I was about the food I ate, strictly Ital. 
Campbell quickly repressed the record as the Itals to meet demand. Today the song remains the Itals' signature tune, and has been described by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones as the perfect reggae track.  It is included on the Rolling Stones Artist Choice CD, released in 2003, available through Starbucks Coffee from Hear Music, a division of EMI, and in selected major chains.
The success of "Ina Disa Time" saw the group return to the studio with the addition of Lloyd Ricketts singing a third harmony part on a series of superb recordings for the SpiderMan label. Tunes like "Don't Wake The Lion," "Brutal," and "Temptation" followed on 7 release in Jamaica and New York in 77 and 78, establishing the Itals among the best Jamaican singers and songwriters. The Itals were twice finalists in the Jamaica Festival Song Competition, and their 1981 tune, "Jamaican Style," earned them a place at Reggae Sunsplash that year. 1982 saw the release of the first Itals' album, "Brutal Out Deh" on Nighthawk Records. The Itals toured the US and Canada backed by the Roots Radics. Their second album, "Give Me Power," was released to critical acclaim and hit #1 on CMJ's Reggae Route chart. In 1985, Pollstar Magazine placed them in the top 100 artists of the year.<p>
Their third album, "Early Recordings," gathers together all the Itals' early singles and several rare pre-Itals tracks for a collector's feast from Nighthawk.  The Itals' fourth recording, "Rasta Philosophy," won a Grammy nomination for best reggae album in 1987, followed by "Cool And Dread."  Next came the Rhythm Safari album Easy to Catch, followed by Modern Age on Ras Records. The Itals continued touring throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.<p>
Over the years, the Itals have performed countless shows worldwide.  Although the background harmonies sometimes change, they always sound as sweet as ever, backing the original Itals lead vocalist, Keith Porter. Now, with the release of Mi Livity, Mr. Porter steps a little further out front and demonstrates why good reggae music allows no labels or limitations.

GREAT AMERICAN TAXI   <p>www.greatamericantaxi.net
Your head would spin adding up all the miles the members of Great American Taxi have traveled individually, and in just over two years together theyve added a whole lot more to their travelogues.  From their home in the high country of Colorado to the shores of the Pacific and back again through the grain belt of the Midwest heading further east to the Atlantic Ocean, Taxi has ridden the highways and biways spinning yarns and delivering high octane music to all who show up at their live shows and consume their 21st century Americana sound.  From the bars, clubs and theaters to the main stage of Wakarusa to late night sets at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, up north to the 10,000 Lakes Festival via Summer Camp, and out west to the High Sierra Music Fest, the band has carved out their own territory in a very short time.  Audiences are instantly immersed in their their folk and country sensibilities while they are fed large doses of improvisation and rock and roll.  Touring relentlessy in 2007 supporting their debut CD release Streets of Gold, and with over 200 plus shows behind them in their short time together,  Great American Taxi has built a hefty following the old fashioned way.  With front-man Vince Herman at the wheel people will recognize threads of the Leftover Salmon fabric all the while being driven by original songwriting and musicianship from guitarist/vocalist Jefferson Hamer and keyboardist/vocalist Chad Staehly.  The rhythm section and axles of the ride are supplied by well-seasoned veterans Jake Coffin on drums/vocals and Edwin Hurwitz on bass guitar.  Jake spent years on the road with Dan Bern and Edwin clocked many miles with 90s jambands Shockra and Skin.  Great American Taxi traffics their collective past helping create their new   Americana without borders brand of music.
<p>
BARRY SLESS <p>
When it comes to playing western swing and boogie-woogie pedal steel, Barry Sless is unsurpassed. Barry can swing with the best of 'em - whether it's soaring on a high pedal steel harmonic or doing some soulful playing on the guitar. When Barry is not touring with the The Dead, Phil Lesh & Friends,David Nelson Band, and most recently Great American Taxi, toursnationally as a member of Moonalice.  Moonalice is another all-star band featuring Hot Tuna pianist Pete Sears, and former Kingfish drummer Jimmy Sanchez.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">The Greyboy Allstars together again, Citta di Vitti's jazzy soundtracks
 <p>
The Greyboy Allstars first came together 15 years ago at the Green Circle Bar in San Diego, a club that's now gone like a cool breeze. A DJ who calls himself Greyboy spun funk, soul and boogaloo jazz records there. A scene developed and there was a call for live music. With the help of saxophonist Karl Denson, who'd played with Lenny Kravitz, Greyboy assembled an all-star combo drawing players from various area bands, among them guitarist Mike Andrews aka Elgin Park, bassist Chris Stillwell, drummer Zak Najor, and organist Robert Walter. <p>
"The Green Circle was cool," recalled Walter, when I caught up with him via cell at his relatively new home in New Orleans. "It was in a sort of crappy part of town, off the beaten path with no other clubs around. It was kind of a hipster bar where people dressed up. They had a few touring acts. Greyboy was the DJ, he played every weekend and also on Wednesdays. Wednesday was our night; he'd play before us and after, and we'd play two big sets."<p>
Greyboy wasn't really in the band but served a role that Walter described as "spiritual advisor" and a "taste thermometer." <p>
"He helped us avoid any tackiness in the style. He was all about a certain era of records, which was basically soul-funk and jazz records from like 1967-1972. That was the golden age that influenced us. So we got turned onto all this music, and from there we insinuated our own personalities into it and it became something else. But that's how it started, as a tribute to Prestige and Blue Note funky jazz records." <p>
In 1995 the band released an album called West Coast Boogaloo with Fred Wesley from James Brown's band producing. The Greyboy Allstars took off, although when they hit the road, Greyboy typically stayed at home. Over time the various players spun off on what they deemed "sidecar projects." Elgin put a rock band together under his nom de plume. Walter formed a combo he called Robert Walter's 20th Congress, then there was Karl Denson's Tiny Universe. The Greyboy association ultimately fell by the wayside, as the various players became stars in the then-nascent jamband scene. Walter and Denson in particular became notional stars in that scene.
Then a couple of years ago the Allstars decided to reassemble for a tour, then for an album, What Happened to Television? with Greyboy at the helm. It was a natural thing to do, and almost inevitable. Says Walter, "For me personally  and I don't know if Karl feels the same, but I have a feeling he does  doing those other things is great because I get to play more of my own music and push my aesthetic and all that, but as far as a band, I've always been trying to chase this sound, trying to have a band that sounds as good as this one. You know, there's something about the interaction of players and the democratic nature of the group that makes it easier and better sounding than other things. You might have some idea you can't pursue because we still go for a narrow aesthetic, but when you get in a room and start playing a groove, it just  it just sounds great."<p>
It's true. The music sounds great, as funky as ever, kinda jammy and very cool. The Greyboy Allstars are now preparing for a spring tour (it's spring as of 5:58 p.m. Thursday), reassembling once more to hit the road with almost all of the original line-up (Najor has been replaced by drummer Aaron Redfield). A West Coast jaunt brings the boys to Eureka on Monday, March 24, for a show at Red Fox Tavern with an added bonus: Underground hip hop artist Busdriver opens.
<p>

Oakland-based jazz saxophonist Phillip Greenlief has a new project going. He spent some time watching moody films by Michelangelo Antonioni, Red Desert, L'Eclisse and L'Avventura, all of them starring the stunning actress Monica Vitti. As he watched with the sound on mute, he composed spontaneous soundtracks. He then brought in a rhythm section, a duo known as duo B. with Lisa Mezzacappa on contrabass and Jason Levis on drums and percussion. The trio, dubbed Citta di Vitti, also performs compositions written by Nino Rota for the films of Federico Fellini. They'll be playing these soundtracks Saturday, March 22, at Avalon during the dinner hour and on March 23, at Muddy's Hot Cup during what would qualify as Sunday brunch. Make this music your own soundtrack.
<p>

Is anyone still playing ska? Well, yes. Boss 501, a six-piece comprised of Chico State students, plays ska and rocksteady along with primal reggae and dub at the Jambalaya on Thursday. Local feral jazz band Dogbone opens. <p>
For roots and culture style reggae stop by Six Rivers Friday where Jamaican-born New Yorker Sister Carol, aka Mother Culture, brings in The Yellow Wall Dub Squad, a team of JA-studio vets, and special guest Ms. Annicia Banks. Humboldt transplant Elhadji (from Senegal) opens. 
Also in the reggae mode and also playing Friday, Amha Baraka and the Living Man Band, led by a singer out of Washington D.C. via San Francisco. 

<p>
The local rock 'n' rollerskate crowd gathers Friday at Aunty Mos Lounge (formerly Indigo, Club West before that) for the Redwood Rollers roller derby team benefit art and dessert auction/rock show featuring heaviness from Dragged by Horses and Side Iron, very indie rock by Arrogant Hare and feminist punk by Kill the Switch. 
Young rockers Steel Toed Slippers play at an Equinox election event Friday at Beginnings Octagon for apple grower/Supes candidate Clif Clendenen. STS also joins up with above-mentioned punkers Kill the Switch, post-punk rockers This Dying Wish and Portland psyche metal duo Palo Verde for a Placebo show (yes, all ages) Saturday at the Ink People space in the back of the Muni.
<p>
Later that night (Placebo shows end early by design), it's more Portland metal with Facepilot (on the stoner rock side) along with Tacoma sludge rock duo Lozen. What, no local support?
<p>
Paul from the arty alt. rock band No Not Yet (who I have no heard yet) writes to say NNY is playing Saturday at the Jambalaya with Tao Jonesers and the punky The Baby Arms, "Or if you prefer, one really complicated band: No Baby Joneser Arms, Not Tao Yet."
<p>
Are you missing The Rubberneckers? Two of them, Clay Smith (the one who's not a journalist) and Brendan Otto play Monday at Big Pete's. 
Across town Monday at the Arcata Playhouse saucy comedy duo Cass King and John Woods aka The Wet Spots offer a somewhat kinky sex-ed vaudeville/music review.
<p>
Since Leftover Salmon spawned and floated downstream a few years back, guitarist Vince Herman has turned his attention to a new project, Great American Taxi, pursuing a slightly less "polyethnic" take on Americana. For the current GAT tour, which comes to the Red Fox Tuesday, the band also includes pedal-steel player Barry Sless from the David Nelson Band, Phil and Friends, The Dead, etc. Added bonus, they're on the road with Colorado-based Victor Barnes, who offer "insurgent bluegrass" as the opening act.
Those in search of high-toned entertainment might want to take in the Tchaikovsky Perm Ballet performance of Romeo and Juliet Tuesday at the Van Duzer. Is this the real deal? Well, the Russian dance troupe travels with a full orchestra instead of a CD player, if that's any indication. <p>
Next Thursday, March 27, marks the 16th Annual Taste of Main Street, a mobile grazing party with nibblers ranging among 21 sites in downtown and Old Town Eureka. The night also marks the beginning of this year's Redwood Coast Jazz Festival, about which you'll hear much more next week. The kick-off is a Big Band Dance at the Adorni with music by Swing Fever, a quarter century old band from the By Area that swings on tunes by Duke, the Count, Gershwin, Porter and the like. Ready to swing? This is the start of a long weekend made for dancers.<p>

I got an e-mail the other day from Folklifer/songster Joel Sonenshein. He's coordinating a house concert featuring Audrey Auld-Mezera, an Australian expat songwriter who lives in Bolinas (in Marin County) and sings like she's from the South instead of the land down under. She'll be in town next Friday, March 28, with ace guitar player Andrew Hardin, who played for many years with Texas folky Tom Russell. The house concerts work like this: Joel sends the details out via e-mail to a hundred or so people. They pass it along to friends; everyone needs to e-mail or call to set up a reservation and to find out whose house the show is at. Having attended a few of these shows, I can testify that it's an incredibly intimate way to experience music up close and personal. Over the weekend Joel called me asking for help with a little disaster. Something went haywire in his e-mail program: All of his e-mail is irretrievably lost and so is his e-mail list. He's not sure who's coming to this show and he can't inquire. Now computers are pretty much black boxes to me  I can't fix his e-mail  but I can do this, post the house party man's e-mail address: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="42282d272e0223312b316c212d2f">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Going to see Audrey? Were you on the list before? Want to be on it now? Drop him a line and help him resurrect his list.

 <p>
The Asylum Street Spankers van was in Arizona heading west when I rang Christina Marrs, the band's saw player (and vocalist, tenor guitarist, banjo and uke player) on her cell. <p>
We started off talking about Asylum Street, a thoroughfare in the Spankers' hometown Austin, Texas. "It's the street that goes by the asylum," said Christina. "They call it the state hospital now, and they call Asylum St. Guadalupe or The Drag. But if you look at an old map of Austin you see the asylum way out on the outskirts of town and one little road that goes out to it. Now of course, it's quite central."
In the beginning, 14 years ago, Christina and Wammo, the band's other lead vocalist and washboard player, would busk on Asylum St. and play in Austin clubs with a 10-piece acoustic jug band. <p>
"When we started out we did a lot more covers, old country blues, jug band tunes, that kind of thing," said Christina. "Original songs started getting added to the repertoire, but we still do old tunes along with our own. Our records tend to be mostly original, but the live shows include older stuff and even more recent stuff that isn't ours." <p>
Among the original tunes is a send-up of the song "Tie a Yellow Ribbon,' updated as "Stick Magnetic Ribbons on Your SUV." According to Christina the topical song written a few years ago has fallen from the repertoire, as the gung ho stickers seem to have disappeared of late. "And as far as the Spankers being political, it only happens when the opportunity arises to be humorous about it, to have fun with it and make fun of the situation  that's really the only time we're ever going to get very political. With our crowd and our demographic, it's just preaching to the choir."  <p>
What is their crowd and demographic? "Oh, I'd say the average age is probably about 35, but that spans a lot. We like to say we have both kinds of blue hair at our shows." <p>
The common thread of that crowd is probably a sense of humor. So, what could be more appropriate than seeing the Spankers on Tuesday, April Fool's Day? That's when the band's Left Coast tour hits Humboldt Brews.
As Eureka prepares to batten down the hatches for Jazz Fest weekend and the onslaught of blue-haired dancing Dixielanders and zoot-suited youngsters (and everything in between), the rest of the county goes on with business as usual.  
<p>
Jazz may be in the air, but the Red Fox is reggae central with the classic Jamaican trio The Itals on Friday. Last I heard, Keith Porter was the last original Ital still carrying the torch forward, his daughter Kada among those singing harmony. Saturday the Fox has Neil Fraser, aka Mad Professor, the crazy (like a fox) British dub master. The Prof typically travels with a suitcase full of electronic gadgets and a stack of DATs  that's all he needs to rock the party. Sunday it's Midwestern reggae with Jah Roots led by an irie cat who calls himself Ras Josh. Humboldt's own Jah Sun takes the mic as a special guest.
<p>
Meanwhile in Arcata, Humboldt Brews offers a solid weekend starting with Berkeley neo-Afrobeat band Albino! on Thursday. Friday it's something jazzy: Mike Kaptitan's Miles Davis tribute Miles Ahead. 
<p>
Saturday HumBrews brings in The Easy, a reggae-ish rock band from Maui that includes former Humboldt local Jeff Thorpe, who once played bass with the funky Doctor Jiveslice and The Bump Foundation. Jeff wrote describing The Easy as, "a unique Hawaiian rock and roll musical experience fronted by an amazing ukulele playing singer-songwriter." He also noted that the opening act is an all-star mash-up of Bump Foundation and Moo-Got-2, dubbed Bumping the Moo.  
<p>
Sunday at HumBrews it's Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, a band from Rochester NY with a killer name, playing something they call "North American international body music," which is to say reggae/Afrobeat/jamband/dub. They're pretty damn good judging from the tunes posted on MySpace (playing as I type). 
<p>
UKEsperience, Humboldt's finest (and only) ukulele jamband, has returned from the 2008 Waikoloa Ukulele Festival in Hawaii, home of all things uke. Check out their tans Saturday at Six Rivers, where they play with special guest Nick Russo.
<p>
Remember in last week's Hum I mentioned that Colorado "insurgent bluegrass" band Victor Barnes was opening for Great American Taxi? Victor Barnes is back (or still here) to headline a show Thursday at Jambalaya with Steel Toed Slippers opening and DJ Chico spinning between.
<p>
The latest in the endless stream of Portland imports comes to the Jam Friday. The Quick and Easy Boys is an unusual country/rock/funk power trio mixing Hendrix licks with Hank Williams twang and Meters-style funk. Very cool. Bonus: local psychedelic-folk treasure Joanne Rand opens with Robert Franklin on guitar. 
<p>
The Yay Area meets Humboldt at the Mateel Friday night with one of the founders of the Hyphy Movement, E-40, sharing the stage with homegrown acts including Potluck, Cool Nutz, Da Grindaz and DJ Itchie Fingaz. 
<p>
Ready to dance? The Bay Area Balkan band Brass Menazeri plays for folkdancers Saturday at Redwood Raks, the newly named space in the Old Arcata Creamery Building. At the same time at Freshwater Grange, it's an "Old Time Country Dance" with music by The Country Pretenders and The Bayside Quartet with Katie Belknap on piano, Jim Cornwell on guitar and mandolin, and Judy Hageman and Brooks Otis on fiddles. (Bayside Q also plays next Saturday at the Graves for Arts Alive!)
<p>
Friends of salmon and wild rivers take note: The quasi-Celtic Druid Sisters Tea Party plays a benefit for the valiant efforts of the Friends of the Eel River Saturday at Mazzottis. 
<p>
Tech Williams of "Do Som Bout It" Productions, takes the party outdoors on Sunday afternoon bringing something called  "The Brigade" (a hip hop crew?) to Eureka's Carson Park, "right in the smack middle of town between the one ways; y'all know were it's at," as Tech puts it. He also notes, somewhat poetically, "If it rain, this will not go down, so pray for sun, so we can have fun."
<p>
The local hard rock crowd gathers Sunday evening at the Boiler Room to remember Matt Evans, drummer for Cycle of Violence, who died in February at the age of 26. The Social Ills, Anslinger, The Baby Arms and No Cigar offer heartfelt loudness for the occasion.<p>

You might recall a show back in February with local "instrumetalists" 33 1/3 playing to raise cash to offset legal fees in a copyright infringement lawsuit that has Eugene doom metal trio, Middian locked in battle with members of a Milwaukee-based metal band called Midian. While the suit drags on, the Oregonian band is resolute, declaring on their MySpace, "The underground metal community's love has simply been overwhelming. With your help and support, Middian will stand triumphant against this truly evil attack on our persons and families." Show your support Sunday when 33 1/3 and Middian play at the Alibi. 
<p>
The insider show for next week is definitely the Two Part Beast gig Monday, March 31, at the Accident Gallery. Two Part Beast is fronted by Imaad Wassif, a Lou Barlow associate who was in alaska! and The New Folk Implosion, and also served as touring guitarist for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Imaad and 2-Part have a new album out, Strange Hexes, described by booking agent Michelle (of Panache) as "heavy-psyche-folk-rock with eastern modal influence." The Broken Hearts and Monster Women provide local support for Monday's show.
<p>
The talk of the town this Monday was the upcoming Willie Nelson gig in SoHum set for August 31, the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. People Productions has Benbow Lake State Park reserved for the date, and that's how it's listed on Willie's website, but the preferred plan is to use Dimmick Ranch, the new home of Reggae, provided the Planning Commission signs off on an expanded permit. Since Tom Dimmick and People Productions are still locked in a legal battle with the Mateel over the lease for the site, and the Mateel folks are making waves with the Planning Comm., the ranch idea is by no means a done deal. But it is certain that the show will happen one place or the other. And no, I don't know when tickets will go on sale.
<p>
I'm sure this will come as bad news to Glenn Maxon of Redwood Coast Music Festivals. Monday morning we were talking about his decision to move the date for Blues by the Bay from mid-July to Labor Day weekend, in part to pull in the just returning HSU crowd, but also to put the two-day fest on a three-day weekend, one where Glenn saw no local competition. He's got British blues legend John Mayall as Sunday's headliner. Will Willie steal the boomer crowd? I guess we'll see.

Redwood Coast Jazz Fest evolves.
<p>
 The Redwood Coast Jazz Festival has come a long way since it began as a traditional Dixieland festival in the '90s. Now in its 18th year, the festival has had to evolve or face extinction.<p>
"Before I got here they actually took Dixieland out of the [festival] title, but they did not really make major changes to the bands they booked," said Redwood Coast Festivals executive director Glenn Maxon, adding, "We're widening the jazz genres some more."<p>
Of course the festival has indeed evolved over the years, adding blues, Cajun music, neo-swing, even bluegrass to the mix. The major addition this year is a sit down jazz concert Friday night at the Arkley Center featuring what Maxon sees as "modern jazz." Specifically that means the Brubeck Brothers Quartet, with two of jazz icon Dave Brubeck's sons  Daniel Brubeck on drums and Chris Brubeck on trombone and bass  plus guitarist Mike DeMicco and pianist Chuck Lamb. Also on the bill Friday at the Arkley Center, Incendio, a Los Angeles-based Latin jazz fusion quartet following along the lines of the Gipsy Kings. Admission for the Friday night show is $40 without a general festival ticket, $10 if you have an all-weekend ticket ($75) or an all-day Friday ticket ($30).<p>
"We're a jazz festival and this gives us something for everybody  I hope," said Maxon. "We're trying to attract the younger audience. We've had some great swing jazz shows with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy headlining last year, Cherry Poppin' Daddies the year before that and we have Lavay Smith this year. " <p>
In addition to past festival faves Lavay Smith and her Red Hot Skillet Lickers, the Saturday night dance party at the Muni includes the energetic jump swing of Steve Lucky and the Rhumba Bums featuring Miss Carmen Getit, and a band led by blues guitarist/singer J.C. Smith (no relation to Lavay). Admission for the Saturday night show is $30 without a general festival ticket, $5 if you have an all-day Saturday ticket ($40) or a three-day ticket. <p>
Another show available to those without general tickets is the silent movie. This year the film is Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, a classic from 1926 with the baby-faced comic Harry Langdon in the lead, a young Joan Crawford in a supporting role and Frank Capra writing and co-directing. The five-piece Pastime Silent Movie Orchestra, a spin-off from the Humboldt Ragtime Band, provides a live sound track. Film admission is just $5, free with a jazz fest ticket. Showtimes are 4:30 p.m. on Friday, 4 p.m. Saturday (right after local old timey band Huckleberry Flint) and at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, with all shows at the Arkley Center. 
For a jazz fest teaser there's the opening ceremony Friday at noon at the Arkley Center with two trad bands, Titan Hot 7 and Blue Street  and free admission. Blue Street also plays at the Sunday morning hymnals at the Adorni Center, another free show. Uptown Lowdown also plays for free Sunday at the First United Methodist Church (at 520 Del Norte St., Eureka).<p>
Another change this year is in the array of venues. Ownership of Indigo/Club West (now Auntie Mo's) was in question when the festival was booked, so that one's out. The Eureka Theater has also been dropped. All of the tent venues disappeared a couple of years ago, and of course the Eureka Inn remains closed. Maxon's solution to the drop in available spaces was to add two buildings at Redwood Acres into the mix. Franceschi Hall (the big building where the flea market is held) will have swing and Cajun bands (Gator Beat and Tom Rigney) along with a smattering of trad (traditional Dixieland) jazz. The Vickers Building next door (aka the Home Ec building) will have an almost exclusively trad line-up (same with the Red Lion). 
As Maxon points out, Redwood Acres also has an RV park and there is still a small circle of seniors who follow their favorite Dixieland bands like Deadheads traveling from festival to festival. A pair of shuttles will run from venue to venue downtown; a third bus will loop out to Redwood Acres on a regular basis.
While there have been a decent number of ticket sales from out-of-towners, Maxon admits that advance ticket sales are slow overall. "I'm sure it's the economy  $4 a gallon for gas doesn't help," he said.
He's counting on the locals to support the festival, and with it something he sees as key: youth music programs at local schools. With budget cuts looming across the education world, the added boost that comes from the festival proceeds is more important than ever. 
"Everyone knows that a higher percentage of music students go on to college. To make it in music you have to learn to practice and work hard," said Maxon. "We're out there supporting the music programs all over the county."<p>

JOANNE RAND  www.joannerand.com
<p>
Just try to peg Joanne Rand's music, it's impossible:  radical, classical, earth-based, politico-spiritual, folk-rock "song poetry" of the ages, written for the masses, but really appealing to the individual.  Rand's twenty-plus year career includes performances with Bonnie Raitt, John Hartford, Janis Ian, members of the Grateful Dead, John Trudell, Floyd Westerman, Ralph Nader, and the McGarrigle sisters.<p>
"Once upon a time a pigtailed kid with a big stick stood on a Georgia Mountaintop, singing the birds right out of the trees. At sixteen she began a big zigzag all over this country and beyond: Florida, London, Chicago, Santa Fe, Alaska, the Amazon. Then she hit the Pacific Northwest and a certain wild river captured her heart.<p>
To this river is dedicated Joanne Rand's seventh self-produced album. Into the River is all about claiming your life, diving from the head into the heart. "Dive in! The river is yours, the river is now, river of life." In an age of uncertainty, Rand evokes the human values of love, compassion and courage.<p>
During the late 1980s this same river gave Rand the guts to come out as a radical singer songwriter, winning fans throughout the US. <p>
"Joanne Rand¹s singing raises your hair  elegance and fierceness in the same deep breath." Gary Snyder. <p>
She has been performing nationally and recording ever since, weaving her life into her work: from the loss of her brother (songwriter, Jordan Rand, whose songs grace her albums), to the birth of her daughter, Georgia. Rand, whose style has been dubbed Psychedelic-Folk-Revival and Acoustic Ritual spins songs of transformation and grassroots power. From audiences of 60,000 to personal appearances for hospice patients, weddings and birthing mothers, Rand moves hearts along a wide spectrum of human existence.<p>
With roots in classical piano, gospel and the politico-folk-rock music of her youth, as well as indigenous songs and chants, Rand's career has included performances with Bonnie Raitt, Richie Havens, Janis Ian and members of the former Grateful Dead. During the 1990s Rand anchored Seattle's hometown music scene. At the same time Rand's quartet was voted Best Acoustic Band in Sonoma County by a California reader's poll. In 2002 she was proclaimed Sebastopol, CA's Official Folk Singer by the city Mayor.<p>
Joanne has since returned to Humboldt, and recently released "Where Our Power Lies", a new album that contains 14 songs featuring Steve Kimock, members of Copper Wimmin, 2 full bands and so much more. Inspired by wild characters, wild rivers and mountains, this CD is her best yet!

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Yonder Mountain String Band </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">If Yonder Mountain String Bands fourth studio album and self-titled debut for Vanguard Records sounds a little different, well, it should. It marks the first time the burgeoning progressive string band has worked with a stellar rock producerTom Rothrock (Foo Fighters, Elliott Smith, Beck and James Bluntits the first time theyve added a little drums to their mix of banjo/bass/mandolin/guitar and its the first time theyve written almost an entire album spontaneously. Yonder Mountain String Band catches them transitioning into more folk and rock territories and most certainly and ceremoniously exploring different sounds and ways of songwriting.
Previously, guitarist Adam Aijala, mandolinist Jeff Austin, banjo player Dave Johnston and bassist Ben Kaufmann would each show up to the studio with their own songs, or songs that had already been worked up on the road. But with Rothrock behind the boards, they sat around and came up with songs that stirred the bands creative juices in a new way. It definitely was the challenge that was ready to be taken on, says Austin. For me, it was a very necessary step that the band had to take, just because weve always been about letting ourselves experiment to the full width of the spectrum. It was a part of us that was just dying to come out.
<p>
Under Rothrocks leadership, Aijala added electric guitar to the album, while Austin, milked an old 70s amplifier for feedback with an acoustic mandolin. Ambient noise accompanies the disc-ending Winds On Fire. The cinematic instrumental Midwest Gospel Radio was born out of Rothrocks request for a spiritual number. Says Aijala, Toms input certainly gave the songs a new and interesting feel.
On the upbeat, rousing, first single How Bout You? and Classic Situation, the band also brought into the fold Elvis Costello drummer Pete Thomas, who changed the sensibility of the record, says Ben. All of a sudden, our perspective got a little broader. His drumming shows up fundamentally and very subtly in places throughout the record. Ill leave that up to the listener to find these. We ended up with an album thats got rippin bluegrass on it, but approached in a non-traditional way, which really appeals to me because we are not a traditional band. Its always been forward-thinking and this is the first time weve captured that in the studio."
<p>
As a result, the always progressive Yonder Mountain continues to close the gap between bluegrass and rock: With its dueling electric guitar/banjo solo section, How Bout You? has the goods to turn people on to a new way of thinking about how a banjo can be played. There are places where the banjo and the mandolin become rock instruments, says Kaufmann. Angel, meanwhile, could be dubbed hard-folk Thats a song where we draw from personal influences that bridgefor usour love of heavier rock music, with lyrical imagery thats clearly traditional, Kaufmann continues. Theres a fiddle in the solo section, but its clearly channeling the spirits of the rock guitar gods.
<p>
Fusing traditional elements and modern techniques, the discs leadoff cut, Sidewalk Stars, appropriately and perfectly captures the spirit of Yonder Mountain on this album.
A few of the tracks were worked up live, and a few come from outside sources. I Aint Been Myself in Years was written by band friend Benny Galloway, and East Nashville Easter was penned by Austin and lauded singer/songwriter Todd Snider. And its in songs like the latter where the bands experimentations make even more sense.
<p>
Twisting and bending their sound with a rock producer was a natural next step for a group of guys who actually grew up on rock music. Comprised of Colorado transplants that grew up in the Midwest or Northeast, none of the band members had backgrounds in bluegrass music, but rather discovered it through old and new records and fellow musicians during college.
<p>
But it was indeed their new and growing love for bluegrass that quite unexpectedly brought the four players together during a free-for-all jam session at The Verve, a bar outside of Boulder, in 1998. Once they met, they knew they were onto something. It was an eye-opening experience because we heard a unique sound, says Johnston. Something coalesced that night.
<p>
Emphasizing song craft and unafraid to push its boundaries, things began snowballing quickly. In 1999, the band debuted with Elevation, produced by Grammy-winning dobro player Sally Van Meter and released (like each of its previous studio discs) on their own Frog Pad Records. Yonder Mountain returned in 2001 with Town by Town, helmed by Grammy Award winning songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Tim OBrien. Van Meter was back behind the boards for the 2003 set Old Hands, a concept album of sorts that featured the songwriting of Benny Burle Galloway. Featured on the evocative tunes about cowboys, miners and all sorts of hard-livin Western folk were OBrien, lauded fiddleman Darol Anger (Bela Fleck, David Grisman Quintet, Vassar Clements) and dobro player Jerry Douglas (Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris).
<p>
In between those studio discs, the band released Mountain Tracks Volume 1-IV, issued on Frog Pad Records, and each capturing the energy of its increasingly popular live shows.
With little radio support, Yonder Mountain has become one of the fastest rising touring bands in the country, its fanbase having ballooned over the past five years through steady gigging and high-profile festival sets, all of which are full of improv and none of which feature the same set list. Now that were maturing as performers, our improvisation is more beholden to playing with good tone, good feel, good timing, says Johnston.
It cant be understated just what the band has achieved with that untraditional banjo/bass/mandolin/guitar line-up. Using bluegrass as its bedrock, the band has grown like few rock bands even do these days. Its funny, says Austin. But now were playing before 4,000 people in Denver. Last year, we played before 700 people in Atlanta and we recently sold-out a 3,000 seat venue there! Added Kaufman,  I think theres just something about the banjo that makes people feel good.
<p>
[This album] probably represents us more than any other record weve done, states Aijala, because it incorporates more of our musical influences than ever before. Its a really cool
thing to be a part of and Ill never take for granted just how lucky we are to do what we do. It makes me more excited for the future.

BERNIE WORRELL   www.bernieworrell.com
Bernie Worrell first came to prominence as a founding member and musical director of Parliament/ Funkadelic.While this massively influential supergroup was radically altering the course of music, he was radically charting the course of emerging keyboard technology during the golden age of analog synthesis. Among the key ingredients in his sonic stew were perfect pitch and a well-honed facility with the classical canon.<p>
A child prodigy who began studying piano at the tender age of three, performed his first classical concert at the age of 4, wrote his first Concerto at the age of eight and performed with the Washington Symphony Orchestra at ten. His classical studies would continue throughout his adolescence, including private lessons at the Julliard School of Music, before Majoring in Classical Piano at the New England Conservatory of Music.
<p>
Upon leaving the Conservatory, Worrell served for several years as Musical Director for Maxine Brown before joining George Clinton's Parliament/Funkadelic crew. Worrell then proceeded to provide this freewheeling collective with a structural foundation which, while occasionally implied, was ever present. At the same time, he explored and expanded his own musical ideas in every conceivable direction with a brazenness which was both revolutionary and evolutionary. From fanciful forays on clavinet which leapt without warming from guttural gulps to squiggly squeals to liquid Minimoogª bass-lines which herded listeners to the dance floor, it all represented new musical language. All the while, his rapid advancements of the synthesizer's potential were actually traceable to his classical foundation. "When the synthesizers came about, my having been brought up classically - knowing a full range of orchestra, tympanis and everything, I knew how it sounded and what it felt like. So, if I'm playing a horn arrangement on the keyboard or strings, it really sounds like real strings or horns, because I know how to phrase it - how a string phrases, different attacks from the aperture for horns, for the trumpets, sax, or trombones." The hits were many: Flashlight, Atomic Dog, Aqua Boogie, Cosmic Slop, and Red Hot Mama are only a few of the Parliament/Funkadelic classics which Worrell co-wrote, played, and co-produced on literally dozens of albums - not to mention his years of wild P-Funk performances, which quickly became the stuff of lore.<p>
After departing Parliament/Funkadelic, he resurfaced with the revamped Talking Heads lineup for several albums, including the Name of This Band is Talking Heads, Speaking in Tongues, and Jonathan Demme's dazzling concert film, Stop Making Sense. Worrell's ominous colorings, this time delivered via new digital keyboards such as the Prophet 5, were central to the recasting of group leader David Bryne's musical ideas through African rhythms.
<p>
In the years since he left Talking Heads, Worrell has been a phenomenally prolific studio musician, serving as a primary change-agent in the many experimental works of producer bill Laswell while contributing his singular flair to projects the likes of Keith Richards, The Pretenders, Jack Bruce, Deee-Lite and Bootsy's New Rubber Band.
At the same time, he has been among the most sampled musicians ever, with Digital Underground, De La Soul, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, DMX and countless others having acknowledged his timeless grooves by building their tunes around his signature riffs.<p>
Worrell also released a series of critically acclaimed solo efforts including Funk of Ages, Blacktronic Science, Pieces of WOO/The Other Side and Free Agent: A Spaced Odyssey. He has become quite a sensation on the jam band circuit, playing with groups ranging from Warren Haynes' Gov't Mule to Laswell's Material and Praxis conglomerations.<p>
In 1997, Worrell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Parliament/Funkadelic (Talking Heads would follow five years later). That same year, he launched his own group, Bernie Worrell and the WOO Warriors, which has performed all over the US and abroad to rave reviews. The in-concert energy of this ensemble has twice been captured on live albums: Bernie Worrell and the WOO Warriors Live (1998) and True DAT (2002).<p>
Worrell's work has also continued to surface in other places. In 1993, when David Letterman moved his program to CBS, Worrell helped launch the CBS Orchestra with Paul Shaffer. He co-wrote the score for the cult classic, Car 54, Where Are You? and other films, including the Ice Cube vehicle, Friday. In 2003, his music was featured in the NBC television mini-series, Kingpin.<p>
The "Wizard of WOO" continues to wear many hats as effortlessly as he mixes musical forms, performing with both Mos Def's Black Jack Johnson band and Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains - while at the same time, continuing to perform from time-to-time as "special Guest" with Clinton's P-Funk All-Stars.
<p>
ERIC MCFADDEN TRIO   <p>www.ericmcfaddentrio.com<p>
Like protagonists from some epic western novel, the Eric McFadden Trio arrives on the jaded contemporary music scene preceded by anxious rumors and curious anticipation. A veteran of celebrated underground bands including Liar, the Eric McFadden Experience, Alien Lovestock and IZM, Eric McFadden's sinister songs, vampiric vocals and flamenco-rock guitar improvisations have made him an icon along America's western seaboard. Lest you dismiss the preceding as absurd hyperbole, consider the fact that McFadden has performed and recorded with the lordly likes of Bo Diddley, the late Joe Strummer, Widespread Panic, psychobilly rockers The Reverend Horton Heat, blues troubadour Keb Mo', Rolling Stone Ron Wood, Primus kahuna Les Claypool and others. He was voted "Best Guitarist" by the New Mexico Weekly and "Guitarist of the Year" by San Francisco's Zero magazine. And in 2000, McFadden was recruited as a touring member of George Clinton's P-Funk All Stars, a distinction that thrusts McFadden into the pantheon of funk-rock guitar idols.

LOTUS  www.lotusvibes.com<p>
Link to Press Photo: <p>http://lotusvibes.com/HTML/promo.php
Lotus, a five-piece ensemble, creates astonishingly danceable soundscapes. The music is heavily influenced by electronic music such as jazzy-house and drum 'n' bass and is mixed with elements of jazz, funk, and ethnic music from India, Africa, and Latin America. Lotus' seamless mixes and interlocking rhythms play like a DJ, but with a human touch. The result is a sophisticated yet accessible dance music with the ability to react instantaneously to the crowd and atmosphere of a room and that appeals to fans of live music, funk and jazz, as well as piquing the interest of electronic music communities.<p>
Since its inception in 1999 Lotus has grown exponentially. The group gained a dedicated fan base by touring throughout the Midwest with excursions to Colorado and the east from 1999-2002. In June of 2002 Lotus relocated to Philadelphia in order to expand its touring schedule. Since the move Lotus has been growing internationally. Regular touring, word of mouth from devoted fans who trade Lotus's music across the country (and globe), and media attention have opened many new markets as familiar ones continue to grow. Lotus' most recent cross-country jaunt during this past Winter 2005 showcased just how well the band has grown by word of mouth and internet communities. They sold out venues such as the Fox Theatre in Boulder on their first true headline in the room, sold out Tribeca Rocks Club in NYC, supported the North American leg of the Ozric Tentacles tour, and closed it out with an opening slot for Michael Franti & Spearhead at Univ. of CO. This summer sess the band debuting at High Sierra Music Festival, All Good Music Festival, the 25th Annual Fat Tire Bike Week and returning to perform a late night set at Smilefest.
The band has been featured in Relix magazine, SF Examiner, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Times Leader Weekender, Fort Collins Weekly, Hittin' the Note magazine, Jambase.com, Jambands.com, The Onion, as well as many more regional magazines, newspapers, websites and specialty radio shows. Lotus's debut album VIBES, released in Feb. 2002, captures moments recorded live in concert during the fall of 2001. The first pressing of VIBES sold out in February of 2003. In March 2003 Lotus signed a record deal with Harmonized Records with national distribution through the Home Grown Music Network joining a strong independent roster of the Motet, Garaj Mahal, The Codetalkers and Perpetual Groove. The album Germination was released in May 2003 and instantly made it to ..2 on the Home Grown Music Network Charts. The eagerly anticipated debut studio release Nomad hit the streets on September 21 on Harmonized Records, showcasing a pristine and reworked sound not yet heard from the band. With only 3 months to work with, the album was the fan choice of 2004 as it sold more via Home Grown than any other disc for the year.
<p>
Lotus continues to evolve both musically and professionally. The use of some of the newest digital technology as well as classic vintage sounds along with a musical vision that grows from show to show makes every night a new experience. The fresh, creative, and mature sounds of these talented musicians are not to be missed.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>DECEMBERISTS' JENNY CONLEE </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">ARCATA SHOW: Casey Neill to play Jambalaya on May 10th
<p>

Portland, Oregon-based singer-songwriter Casey Neill is touring in support of his latest full-length, "Brooklyn Bridge" (In Music We Trust).  "Brooklyn Bridge" features guest appearances by The Decemberists¹ Jennie Conlee and Chris Funk (both play in a Pogues tribute band Neill fronts entitled KMRIA), John Wesley Harding, Eric "Roscoe" Ambel (of Steve Earle and The Dukes), Erin McKeown, and others.
<p>
"Brooklyn Bridge" moves from indie-rock to Celtic, from pop-rock to Americana, all with an earnest, punk mindset that few singer-songwriters can touch - and mean it - when weaving through various genres not only on the same album, but sometimes on the same song.
<p>
The 12-track collection of songs was produced by legendary Scottish fiddler player Johnny Cunninghan, well-regarded in the Celtic and folk worlds as a top-notch player and producer (among many others, he produced Solas, an Irish folk supergroup that covered one of Neill¹s songs), his reach going as far as punk band The Dropkick Murphys, who have previously tapped Cunningham to work with them.
<p>
Neill met Cunningham in 1993 and the two began working together when Cunningham produced Neill¹s second full-length, "Skree" (Appleseed Recordings). Later, it would be Cunningham that convinced Neill to play electric and make a record that encompassed all his influences - from The Pogues and New Model Army to PJ Harvey, Fugazi, and legends Nick Cave and Bruce Springsteen, in addition to his folk and Celtic ones.
<p>
"Brooklyn Bridge" would be a long, exhausting road, but ultimately rewarding one for Neill.  The exhausting and most devastating, and reason for the delay in completing the record, was the untimely death Cunningham, who died of a heart attack on December 15, 2003.
<p>
"We had 12 finished songs in 2003 and we had begun to shop it. I had moved to back Brooklyn from Portland, Oregon. Johnny and I put a band together in the city to perform the material. We played a residency at the Living Room in October of that year," recalls Neill, discussing the completion of "Brooklyn Bridge" before Cunningham's death.  "Johnny passed away suddenly that December and it was devastating. Two nights before he died, we sat in our local pub, the 11th Street Bar, and he gave me a talking to about life and music and his faith in this record. It was almost like he knew he was on his way out. I recorded a few more songs and edited the project since, always trying to imagine what his calls would be."
<p>
From the title track, which opens the album, "a love song for a girl and for the city", as Neill puts it, to the rocking "We Are The City" ("another New York City anthem inspired by the underground community on the Lower East Side in the 90s").  Through the Celtic-infused folk-rock of "The Holy Land", a song that takes place in 19th century New York and tells the story of a John and a prostitute dancing in Water Street outside of Kit Burns' Sportsman's Hall, a notorious venue where rat fights took place, Neill has a knack for storytelling and engaging his audience, all while giving them something to emerge themselves into and forget their worries for awhile.
<p>
"Next door to Sportsman's Hall was a brothel run by John Allen where hymns were sung in the main room. Both Burns and Allen were hated by the moral and religious establishment of the day," explains Neill about the song.
<p>
One song Neill likes to talk about is "Watch For Me", a bleak break-up song, but one where the melody doesn't get lost or forgotten in the bleakness.  Something that worried Johnny so, "Johnny instructed me to party 'til dawn the night before the sessions so I'd sound like hell, like Mark Lanegan, because we were concerned it was going to be too pretty".
<p>
Neill also wrote "King Neptune" after Cunningham's passing and added it to the album.
<p>
"I wrote the song for Johnny and recorded it with his brother Phil playing piano and accordion. I wrote it for a tribute show we did for him at Town Hall in New York," Neill explains.  "The summer before he died he went to the Coney Island Mermaid Parade dressed as King Neptune."
<p>
It was a long road to see "Brooklyn Bridge" through, but one that helped shape and give the record its sound.  Neill is happy to finally pay homage to Cunningham once again, putting out the record he believed in so much to the world and allowing them to hear it.
<p>
With "Brooklyn Bridge" soon to be released, Neill and his band are gearing up to tour in support of the record and will tour both in the summer and the fall.

Sub ID  www.sub-id.com   <p>http://www.jameschristopher.com/
<p>
sub-ID is the soundtrack to the modern world. Their music bridges the gap between DJ culture and the improvisational elements of jazz. sub-IDs sound represents the juxtaposition of their musical influences: organic and electronic, improvised and composed, traditional and contemporary. Live, sub-ID combines relentless dance grooves and psychedelic imagery and lights, with unforgettable melodies and soaring solos creating a concert experience that is completely unique. This is creativity that knows no boundaries in terms of origin and destination. sub-ID's sound design and production skills have been used in virtual instruments, music software, commercials, and commissioned pieces, in addition to working with other artists on albums, remixes, and various collaborations. One fans recent blog says it all, sub-ID is not just a band...it's theater. Theater of sound...sound that takes over the bones and sinew till they have a mind of their own and they jig me on the dance floor like a marionette. <p>
After meeting in music school, Brad Bowden and Alana Rocklin began playing music together in 1999. While living in Chicago, they started their first digital studio creating an atmosphere that would lead to the beginnings of sub-ID and newpolyphony productions. During this time they performed regularly with fusion/electronica group The All Rectangle, which included artists such as AACM saxophonist/pianist Ari Brown, and Garaj Mahal guitarist Fareed Haque. Brad and Alana produced The All Rectangles debut CD Ke Ala Mano (The Way of the Shark), which was distributed by Thrill Jockey Records and received rave reviews from Jazz Times, Billboard Magazine, and The Wire. They performed regularly in Chicago sharing bills with STS9 (Sound Tribe Sector 9), The Chicago Underground, and The Slip. Since moving to Nashville, TN in 2001, the duo has worked with a variety of different artists both together and separately. Alana is one of the most in-demand touring and session bassists in music city, and Brads production skills have been tapped for a variety of sessions in Nashvilles premier studios. Artists and projects they have recently worked with include: Nanci Griffith, Toontrack Music, Clyde Stubblefield, Jabo Starks, Willie Weeks, Victor Wooten, Futureman, Jeff Coffin, Bela Fleck, Kirk Whalum, Suzy Bogguss, Kofi Burbridge, Greg Osby, Steve Smith, Chester Thompson, Count Bass D, Chuck Ainlay, The Grand Ole Opry, BET, CMT, TN Lottery and many others.
<p>
Since forming in 2005, sub-ID has quickly become a favorite amongst underground electronic/new music fans and musicians. Their remix of Better Day was the first single on STS9s critically acclaimed remix record Artifact: Perspectives, appearing alongside artists such as Bill Laswell, Ming & FS, Richard Devine and Slicker just to name a few. It was their remix that attracted STS9s 1320 Records and led to sub-ID being the first artists to sign with the bands label. Since signing with 1320, sub-ID joined STS9 on their fall 2006 national tour playing to thousands across the country. The tour included 22 cities in all the major markets and venues throughout the country, including a sold out crowd at the historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre. In addition, sub-ID has shared bills with Jurassic 5, Prefuse 73, Tortoise, Digable Planets, RJD2, Richard Devine, Telefon Tel Aviv, Edit, and more. The group recently concluded their 2007 fall tour, sharing dates with the Pnuma Trio and STS9. This included sold out concerts throughout this beautiful country in the midwest, south, and east coast. 2008 will see the release of their highly anticipated debut recording entitled BFF along with a slew of original productions, remixes, collaborations, eps, videos, and conceptual products!!!

The struggle for them both is to keep the number of instruments to what they can each easily carry in one trip!
<p>
The two Bad Sues are generally known as Susan Anderson and Sue Moon. Sue Moon is a southern Humboldt fiddler and button accordionist, and also one of our region's most popular dance callers. Folklife Society founder Susan Anderson plays fiddle, flutes, whistles & button accordions. The two Sues have played with the Contra Band, Macchu Picchu, Pasture Prime, and the Rolling Scones.

<p>
EUREKA SHOW: Gary Reynolds & The Brides of Obscurity in Eureka, May 5th at Brogi's Boiler Room

<p>
Seattle, Washington-based Gary Reynolds and the Brides of Obscurity, fronted by studio owner, engineer, and producer Gary Reynolds (vocals, guitar, piano), and including members Don Durham (guitar, vocals), Justin Friesen (bass, piano, vocals), Perry Morgan (drums), and Jeremy Manley (organ, vocals), deliver slightly psychedelic indie-rock with a heavy pop leaning on their sophomore full-length, "Santiago¹s Vest", recorded at Reynolds¹ Seattle studio, Electrokitty Studio.
<p>
Gary Reynolds and the Brides of Obscurity will celebrate the release of "Santiago's Vest" March 8th at Sunset Tavern.  Show is $7.00 and doors at 8pm, show starts at 9pm.  Also on the bill are Curtains for You and Dept. of Energy.

"Santiago¹s Vest is a powerful collection of space-pop done by rockers, a group of men who know their way around psychedelic and pop history, but sometimes just want to have fun and play a catchy power-pop tune.
<p>
"The songs on Santiago¹s Vest¹ were recorded with an entirely different approach [than our previous releases].  We got together and learned the songs in the studio, mainly aiming to keep only the drums and bass.  Then we made up parts and added colors.  The full-length is more produced, too.  I think it¹s safe to say that everyone in the band likes this record best".
<p>
For Gary Reynolds and the Brides of Obscurity, they felt this was the best way to approach it.  A relatively new band, they used "Santiago¹s Vest" to figure out how to work together in the studio.  
<p>
Reynolds says one of the things he¹ s most proud of is that, "we figured out how to take a happy little pop song and twist it.  We also figured out how to take something that may have leaned more towards a rock sort of thing and pull it into a more twisted approach."
<p>
The record was purposely mixed with the bass guitar way up in the balance, using "Abbey Road" as a mix reference.  The result is a record that has a lot more bass guitar than most modern recordings.  This also means that you can¹t get it as loud as other CDs, which is exactly what Reynolds and the band wanted.
<p>
"We¹re avoiding the loudness war¹ that¹s currently going on.  We didn¹t compress the thing to oblivion either," he says with a smile.
<p>
"We¹ve always had a nostalgic feel to our music," Reynolds says without hesitation.  "Not on purpose, but that¹s just the way things turn out. On this record it opens up and sound a bit more current without losing its appeal."
<p>
Look for Gary Reynolds and the Brides of Obscurity¹s "Santiago¹s Vest" in stores in November 2007.

"Brooklyn Bridge" features guest appearances by The Decemberists¹ Jennie Conlee and Chris Funk (both play in a Pogues tribute band Neill fronts entitled KMRIA), John Wesley Harding, Eric "Roscoe" Ambel (of Steve Earle and The Dukes), Erin McKeown, and others.
<p>
"Brooklyn Bridge" moves from indie-rock to Celtic, from pop-rock to Americana, all with an earnest, punk mindset that few singer-songwriters can touch - and mean it - when weaving through various genres not only on the same album, but sometimes on the same song.  The 12-track collection of songs was produced by legendary Scottish fiddler player Johnny Cunninghan, well-regarded in the Celtic and folk worlds as a top-notch player and producer (among many others, he produced Solas, an Irish folk supergroup that covered one of Neill¹s songs), his reach going as far as punk band The Dropkick Murphys, who have previously tapped Cunningham to work with them.

Delta Nove are coming to Arcata!! The Long Beach, CA, based band has no boundaries and induces dancing and grinning with their lively stage presence and contagious grooves. Heavily focusing on reggae, Brazilian, ska and rock styles, their endeavors reflect a passion and drive for music that truly expands the mind. 
<p>
The band consists of five extremely talented musicians playing an array of instruments that are as culturally distinct as their music. They have four self-produced albums under their belts with a new one released in June entitled The Future is When, which captures the bands very diverse musical style and songwriting.
<p>
"Delta Nove has one foot deeply rooted in funk, with monster chops and amazingly rich arrangements, while the other kicks with reggae, Latin, soul, and straight ahead rock, said a journalist for the OC Weekly. 
<p>
Delta Noves steady road to success includes a rigorous touring schedule throughout the United States. They continue to build a steady fan base, performing at massive music festivals such as High Sierra, Wakarusa, 10,000 Lakes, Earthdance, among others. Theyve also graced the stages of impressive venues like the House of Blues, the Knitting Factory, The Troubador and Key Club in Los Angeles.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Jamaican dub master at Mazzotti's, plus trumpets and break-dancers
<p>

The minimalist, bass-heavy, effects-laden variation on reggae known as dub has some serious aficionados (this writer among them), but not a lot of people listen to it. The exception may be the music of Jamaican dub master Overton Brown, better known as Scientist, or The Scientist. Millions have been listening to his album, Scientist Rids the World of the Evil Curse of the Vampires, but, for a time, he did not even know about it. 
<p>
As he explained in a call to his home studio in Southern California, "I was standing in a supermarket one day, and a boy recognized me. He says, 'Mommy, Mommy, that's The Scientist. We have his music on our videogame.' I was wondering what the hell he was talking 'bout. He says, "Yes, your music is on Grand Theft Auto.' I didn't know what it was."
<p>
To be specific, about half of Scientist's Curse of the Vampires album, recorded in the early '80s, was used as content for a radio station called K-JAH in Grand Theft Auto III, a controversial shoot-em-up videogame for Playstation 2 (and other systems) created by Rockstar Games. 
<p>
The game has sold in the millions internationally, but as Scientist put it, "I wasn't getting any money." Not until he hired some lawyers to sue Greensleeves Records, the British label that licensed his music without telling him or giving him a piece of the action. 
<p>
He admits that he has better name recognition because of GTA, but he has mixed feelings about it. "I'm hoping kids don't think I'm a gangbanger or that I endorse shooting police officers. I never played the game, but everyone tells me about it. I don't understand why they have someone who steals a car and shoots up the place, then he's listening to reggae and Rastafari on the radio." 
<p>
Scientist got his start as an engineer (his father was a radio/TV repairman) and as a teen, after training with King Tubby (one the inventors of dub), he took the genre into new realms. He still does engineering work (when we spoke he was in the middle of designing a circuit board for an amplifier). And when he's not in court (suits are pending all over the world) he goes on the occasional reggae tour to work as dubwise soundman extraordinaire. 
<p>
That's what's bringing him to Arcata Thursday, May 1, a show at Mazzotti's: Wild Wild West Reggae Dub 420 Spring Tour '08 includes UK reggae stars Michael Prophet (who sings on the Curse record) and Sammy Dread, Jamaican vocalist Johnny Clarke and Hawaiian Lyon (from Hawaii of course), all backed by The Raggasouljahs, with Lesterfari of Boom Shaka on guitar, the great Santa Davis on drums, and a full horn section, all engineered live by Scientist.
<p>
Speaking of dub, Heavyweight Dub Champion is back in town for a two-night run Friday and Saturday at the Red Fox. The trio is on what they call a "Deep Deep Dub" instrumental tour, which means no chanters or rappers, just tripped-out dub. 
<p>
About that Cowboy Junkies show at Van Duzer on May Day (Thursday the 1st): If you're familiar with the Timmins family band from Canada, it's probably because of The Trinity Session, an album of slo-mo covers and originals from 1988 that was pretty much the only time C.J. broke into the U.S. market. To celebrate the album's 20th anniversary, the band returned to the Trinity Church with a few friends (Ryan Adams, Vic Chesnutt and Natalie Merchant) to "re-interpret" that record as Trinity Revisited. So, if you request some of the old songs, chances are they'll remember them. Monahans, a moody rock duo from Austin/S.F., opens. 
<p>
The poster for the Thrones/SubArachnoid Space show Thursday at the Alibi looks like something from the psychedelic '60s, and it makes sense. Portland's neo-psyche instrumentalists SubArachnoid Space pull the tradition into the here and now with long, loose spirals of darkness. Likewise Thrones, which is basically bassist Joe Preston formerly of The Melvins. 
<p>
Also on Thursday, Long Beach jamband Delta Nove returns to Humboldt Brews for some "world funk."
<p>
Friday at the Pearl Lounge, it's another episode of Miles Ahead with keyboardist Mike Kapitan and friends (Brad Werren handling Miles' trumpet parts) in "a tribute to the music of Miles Davis starting from the Kind Of Blue era to the rockin' psychedelic explorations of the Bitches Brew and Live/Evil period." Very cool stuff.
<p>
Meanwhile at Fulkerson Hall, the Humboldt Symphony presents its spring concert including contemporary composer Robert Bradshaw's "Trumpet Concerto" with Gil Cline on trumpet. The rest of the program veers widely, from Baroque by Telemann, to Gershwin and Stravinsky. <p>

For a different (let's say smoother) style of trumpet, you have Chris Botti playing Friday at the Arkley Center. The jazzy Portland-born Grammy winner's latest is titled Italia, so expect some of that flavor. 
<p>
Next door at Auntie Mos, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are throwing a benefit for HIV Kids and the AIDS taskforce: Mo's Betta Disco Drag Dance Party has what you'd expect, folks in drag dancing to disco, but also drag racing on Big Wheels (really?) and a bike raffle. 
<p>
Songstress Joanne Rand is back at the Jambalaya Friday with her band The Rhythm of the Open Hearts and a special guest: former Jam owner Joyce Hough. ("I'm Joanne's back-up singer," says Joyce.) 
<p>
Over at Mosgo's, Amy Obenski, from Santa Cruz, offers what she describes as "introspective jazzy folk-rock with ethereal vocals."
<p>
The Miracle Show takes its Dead tribute to the Wave Friday. No cover, but bring a coupla quarters and maybe a miracle will happen.
<p>
Break-dancing fool Reckless Rex of Humboldt Rockers (a break-dance troupe) celebrates the 4th anniversary of the Rockers with Battle Time 2, a hip hop show/break-dance contest on Friday from afternoon until midnight at the Bayside Grange, with grand prizes (as in $1,000) and big name judges: BBoy Machine and BBoy Bebe (who also lead workshops this Saturday at Redwood Raks). They have Itchie Fingaz on the tables and some fine MCs including Z-Man (from S.F.), Eureka's Nac One, Dirty Rats outta Fortuna, and J the Sarge.
<p>
J the Sarge is about to drop a disc with Myka 9, a team-up they call Magic Heart Genies. Both of them are on the bill for Homegrown Hip Hop Vol. 5 on Saturday at the Mateel. Souls of Mischief from the Oakland-based Hieroglyphics collective headline the show, which also features Brooklyn's Whosane and Humboldt homies Subliminal Sabotage, with DJ Just One and DJ Elements on the wheels of steel.
<p>
Same time, different city, Tech Williams's Do Som Bout It crew turns the Eureka Vet's Hall into party central with hip hop action upstairs and down including DJ Assassin among others.

The Blue Ox Mill has it's annual May Day Living History and Artisan Fair all day Saturday with the usual crafty demos and tons of music: bluegrass by The Compost Mountain Boys (also playing Saturday for HSU's Compost Festival), cowboy tunes by The Tumbleweeds, old timey by Striped Pig String Band and the Empty Bottle Boys, jugband tunes by Likely Story and Celtic by Hearthfire and Moonstone.

Got kids? Think about taking them to hear Red Grammer on Saturday afternoon at the Arkley Center. Red is a Grammy-winning kids' entertainer, a former folky (he was once a Limeliter) who started writing songs for his own kids, then kept with it. Are your kids 4th or 5th graders? They get in free. Why? "Parents don't take kids to things when they're that age," says Holly, a mom who's been bringing Red to the area for a few years, basically so her son (a 5th grader) can hear him sing. "Red's music relates to kids that age. He's all about tolerance and cultural diversity, but he can't do that music if he has to just keep the babies in their chairs." Expect appearances by some local kids (and adults) and don't worry about being hit over the head with a message. Red makes it all fun.
<p>
The first ever Bike to the Beach Folk Festival takes place Saturday afternoon at Rogers Market in McKinleyville, just off the Hammond Trail. Organizer (and musician) Bob Smith invites you to "celebrate our trail systems and our bike friendly roadways and recreation areas," and listen to tunes by Moonsong Band, Kindred Spirits, The Highclass Hobo Society and Backwoods Capo. 
<p>
The Broken Hearts are breaking up. "It's very sad," says Julia Cupp, the band's lead singer. "I'm leaving for Portland at the end of summer, Zak [McLongstreet, guitarist/accordionist] is going traveling at the beginning of summer. We're going on tour at the end of May with The Ian Fays, starting in S.F. and ending in Vegas, but we're just doing one more local show." That's Saturday (Arts Alive! night) at the Pearl Lounge. <p>Thelittlestillnotbigenough opens. 
Something exotic? San Francisco's Gamelan Sekar Jaya plays traditional and not-so traditional Balinese gamelan music Saturday at HSU's Fulkerson Recital Hall. (Costumed dancers too.)<p>

Or how about Raquay and The Cavemen, a progressive Middle Eastern bellydance-style band from Brooklyn, led by red hot dumbek player Raquy Danziger playing Tuesday, May 6, at Six Rivers, a show presented by Shoshanna. (I'm guessing there'll be costumed dancers at this one too.)
<p>
Also on Tuesday, Andrew McKnight, a "songpoet" from Virginia's Shenandoah Valley sings heartfelt, topical songpoems from his latest, Something Worth Standing For at the Westhaven Center for the Arts.
<p>
Cool/esoteric show of the week: a four-way bill Tuesday at the Pearl featuring two Arcata alt. bands, Brother Mitya (aka John Thomas) and The Beat Nun (Maddy Shernock and friends) plus two touring duos, I Heart Lung and ellul. I Heart Lung is guitarist Chris Schlarb and drummer Tom Steck producing music they refer to as "refined chaos," leaning toward drone with jazzy guitar, subtle percussion, "improvisation and predestination," as they put it. IHL is about to release a drone opera, Interoceans on Asthmatic Kitty Records with guest spots by Nels Cline and pedal steel wiz Dave Easley among others, but this tour is just the two of them. That and labelmates ellul, with two Joels: Joel St. Julien and Joel Brown Tarman both playing guitar (Brown Tarman also plays keys). They both sing (in harmony sometimes) and manipulate all sounds via electronics devices as they "attempt to traffic meaning into a needle-eye spiral using the ever-evolving relationship between acoustic and electronic modalities with the human voice." A worthy goal. Incidentally, Brother Mitya and The Beat Nun also have an all ages show at Mosgo's Saturday, which is a good thing for those too young to hang out in bars.

Artists are allowed to show up to five pieces, depending on size and space availability.  Mateel reserves the right to hang the show and, if space is an issue, which pieces will be included in the exhibit. 
In addition to the main fine arts display, the artsy feel will also be spread throughout the fair and artists with large and durable sculpture type pieces are currently sought.  These pieces would be placed in random locations throughout the festival fairway and everything from lighted night time pieces to enormous oversized installations are needed.  Unbreakable items made of wood, metal, or stone only please.  To show these types of pieces, please call Justin Crellin at 923-3368 ext. 25 ASAP. <p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Howlin' Rain's Ethan Miller and former Weary Boy Mario Matteoli are back in town
<p>
I don't imagine they know each other, but Ethan Miller and Mario Matteoli have followed parallel paths. Both were born and raised in Eureka. Both left Humboldt County just out of high school and established music careers elsewhere. And both are coming home this week for shows at the Jambalaya.
Matteoli relocated to Austin, Texas with some like-minded Eurekans and formed the successful alt. country band The Weary Boys, then left that band to go solo following a new muse. 
Miller moved to Santa Cruz and formed the successful alt. rock band Comets on Fire, then left that band to explore new musical directions with a band called Howlin' Rain. <p>
"I'd worked really hard for my part with Comets on Fire, and really dedicated my life to that, both my musical life and my personal life," said Miller, reached at his home in Oakland. "Wed made four albums. When you think of yourself as an artist, you never want to become too comfortable with what you're doing. You don't want to think, 'Hell, I can dial this in. Another Comets record? No problem,' like this is what I'm known for, I'll do that again."<p>
So, in part because he was moving in a different direction musically, but also just because he felt a need go his own way, he left Comets at its zenith. "I had songs I'd written, a catalogue of songs accumulated that were more personal to me, that were not something I was writing for this entity that was already formed. They were something for me, where I could control the overall vision. I wanted to let them take on a life of their own."<p>
Does the Howlin Rain name connect back to Humboldt? "Maybe a little bit subconsciously," he said. "Certainly the physical and metaphysical characteristics of the area, especially the Southern Humboldt area, and will forever be part of my artistic landscape. My family owns a summer cabin in Southern Humboldt so I spend a lot of time up there. I go there to write and to relax after tours. And my folks are still up in Eureka, so I'm up there a lot too."
And he's booked to play here twice: Wednesday, May 28, Howlin' Rain plays Jambalaya with two Eureka bands, Arrogant Hare and Zak Institute, both including members from Miller's local musical past. H. Rain returns Sept. 10, opening for The Black Crowes at the Van Duzer. "That was a fun surprise," said Miller. "I think that one will be a bit more expensive, and harder to get into." <p>
Former Weary Boy Mario Matteoli was working his way up the California coast with a new solo disc when I found him in SoCal. Despite his nine year Texas roots, the record is called Golden State, in part to reflect a brighter view of the world he's taken on since falling in love. 
"You know, my last [solo] record was kind of depressing, so I was trying to make this one more happy, hopefully not sappy," he explained. <p>"It's hard to come up with something that's happy and not cheesy. The thing is, it's easier to write songs when you're all depressed, but it's not an easy way to live. You have to try to be happy and write good songs, and not make a wreck out of you life. A lot of the great ones, guys like Townes Van Zandt and Hank Williams, they just totally destroyed their lives for their music. It was a beautiful thing, but tragic. I don't want a tragic end."<p>
Mario will be at the Jambalaya Friday with his fiancée Cayce on harmony vocals and tambourine and backing from his older brothers, Jamie and Jason. Advance tickets are advised, if you can get 'em.<p>
Extended versions of the Miller and Matteoli interviews are online at The Journal Blogthing <p>(ncjournal.wordpress.com)<p>
I must be the wrong generation for Night Ranger, who, I'm told, are back to show that "(You Can Still) Rock In America." I don't know that song or any others by the S.F. hair metal stadium rockers who sold something like 10 million records in the '80s. Three out of five of the original members are still on board, now playing amusement parks, county fairs and casinos, Cher-Ae Heights for example, where they rock out on Thursday.<p>
They're calling Thursday's show at the Arkley Center "Cowboy Storytellers," which you might guess means cowboy poets. It doesn't. The benefit for the Eel River Valley Foundation (associated with Redwood Memorial Hospital) features three country singer/songwriters you've probably never heard of, although you may have heard their songs if you listen to country radio. Aaron Barker has written 23 Top-10 songs for guys like George Strait (Easy Come, Easy Go). Paul Overstreet has 27 Top-10s under his belt, including Kenny Chesneys She Thinks my Tractors Sexy. Allen Shamblin wrote a ton of songs including hits for Toby Keith and Keith Urban, plus he co-wrote a song I actually know (I don't hear much country radio), Bonnie Raitt's big hit, I Cant Make You Love Me, from her Luck of the Draw album.
Meanwhile Thursday, next door at Auntie Mo's, it's something quite different: psyche rock trio Dead Meadow, relative big timers in the psyche world, touring behind Old Growth, a new disc on Matador. They share the Mo's bill with local alts Tanuki and The Common Vice. <p>
Stoner doom duo The Fire Demons (with guitar shredder Robert Tripp and ex-Hitch guitarist Jeff Langdon on drums) play Thursday at the Boiler Room with Eureka hip hop headbangers 4 Star Bravado. Saturday The Demons hit the Alibi with Portland party punks The Grip. Tripp notes, "We have a bunch of new material that well be performing at these shows and we expect that the gigs will be a great time for all. Were even giving away free band T-shirts to the first five people who ask. And of course there will be a wall of amps and speakers!" He also mentions that he and Jeff are both visual artists with shows up currently (Jeff at Arcata Artisans; Robert at the Coffee Break). And, "Oh yeah, my other band The Hard Ride is playing garage blues Sunday night at the Lil Red Lion with a punk band from Montreal called CPC Gangbangs. No idea what that means, but that show will also kick ass!" What does it mean? Says their record company Alien8, re: CPC G, "Although their sound is celebratory and consuming, it is often evil as well and full of the promise of self-destruction boosted by copious amounts of cocaine, LSD and Canadian Maple Whiskey." Hmm.<p>
Still talkin' Thursday, you have "funktronica" by San Diego-based BluSirkut at Humboldt Brews. These guys used to be Karl Denson's band, now they're on their own, offering, "mashed potatoes and gravy nu-jazz, with cornbread drum 'n' bass, smothered in collard greens and a big ass side of sampledelic delight." Friday at HumBrews The Fickle Hillbillies jam with special guest David Hines on flute.
Friday at the Red Fox it's Del Mar, ex-Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh's surf punk band, touring with Sacto psychobilly band Sexrat. The Wolf Navarro Project opens. <p>
Ole's back with another Diamondback joint, a hip hop night at the Red Fox Saturday with Cool Nutz from Portland, and locals LCA and The Mendo Green Team in support of Houston's renowned Devin the Dude, a rapper with a sense of humor who broke out 10 years ago with his Odd Squad buddies. The Dude has a couple of new albums, a hits package and one he calls a "mixtape" titled Smoke Sessions Vol. 1, presumably first in a series. Ole calls this a "Funk A Lake" Party (no idea what that means); he also declares, "The Dude abides!"<p>
A Mark Lovelace for Supe benefit Saturday at the Jambalaya includes Cajun music by The Bayou Swamis, DJ Red on the turntables spinning '80s tunes, plus an ad hoc super-group called I Love Lace teaming Mike "The Commish" Wilson from Dynamite Sweater, Rubberneckers' drummer Brendan "Wang!" Otto and that fab folky Lila "Madeline" Nelson. I'm told (by Lila) that the songs are already written and all of them are about how cool Mark is. <p>
At Mosgo's Saturday, DeatHat, a trippy cool/spooky alt. something band from Santa Cruz/San Jose (with a great name) based around a marimba and a bass. Greg Lojko of the 'Neckers opens. <p>
Coming from SoCal to Humboldt Brews Wednesday, May 28, Anthony Smiths Trunk Fulla Funk, which is, in Smiths words, "an infectiously grooving sextet featuring stellar musicians from across the country [playing] a hybrid of classic funk/rock/soul influences, with all the rock and jam-oriented improvisation you might expect."
I got a little bit of static over last week's Pollstar preview of the next CenterArts season, partly because, "You can't believe everything you read in Pollstar" (that Gipsy Kings date was not fully settled), but mostly because some of you ignored my advice and called the ticket office asking questions. In addition to the early tix for The Black Crowes Sept. show, tickets go on-sale next Friday, May 30, for an Asylum Street Spankers gig Sept. 4 at Mazzotti's and for Steel Pulse's Aug. 28 KBR show (same night at The Waifs). Wait. There's more, also on August 28: an AS Presents show outdoors on the lower Soccer Field they're calling the Hum-week Concert 2008, apparently named for this column. So far the line-up includes Ozomatli, Brett Dennen, !!! (aka Chick! Chick Chick!) and the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy troupe. I approve. <p>
Sad times at KMUD: Sunday around the time the Redwood Community Radio folks were celebrating the life of former music director Kate Klein, who died recently, word traveled via the grapevine that JJ "Jahwaiian Jerry" Hall, co-host of "Da Coconut Wireless" Tuesday afternoons, had suffered a fatal heart attack the night before. I imagine they'll be thinking of JJ Saturday afternoon when the station throws the annual KMUD Block Party in front of its Redway studios. They'll have a bar, BBQ, birthday cake and music of course: The N-P-K, Budd Rogers, Antonia Lamb, Cory Hanna, Quantum, Dan Nicholson among others. I'm thinking some slack key guitar would be nice to say goodbye to JJ. 
We'll miss you, man. Aloha `Oe.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fourth of July festivities, drummer wanted, and The Kids of Widney High
<p>

What do you think of, musically, when the Fourth of July rolls around? Brass bands and military drumlines maybe? "The Star Spangled Banner"? For me the old X song "Fourth of July" comes to mind: "On the stairs I smoke a cigarette alone. Mexican kids are shootin' fireworks below..." and that great chorus, "Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July. Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July. Hey baby, baby take a walk outside." 
<p>
My plan for the Fourth: Take a walk outside and on down to the Arcata Plaza, where Independence Day festivities kick off with a decidedly non-military drumline as Bloco Firmeza pounds out a Brazilian batucada (at 11:15 a.m.) and the Samba de Chuva dancers shake things up. There's an international array of dancers as the day rolls on: step-dancing by the Emerald Coast Irish Dancers (at 1), bellydancing by Shoshanna and friends (2:45), all-American breakdancing by Humboldt Rockers (4:30). In between you can expect some noodle dancing when the Dead tribute band The Miracle Show plays at noon. Since we're in Humboldt, homegrown reggae is a must: Jah Sun and High Voltage play at 1; Ishi Dube and Massagana take the stage around 5 (assuming things run on schedule, which they seldom do). Later on, come nighttime, Ishi and Jah Sun team up as Lion's Camp for a show at Humboldt Brews. (They're also part of a Thursday, July 3, showcase at the Red Fox with Messenjah Selah.) Back on the Plaza, Arcata's No. 1 jamband The Nucleus plays in between the reggae. (You'll also find them at the Red Fox that night as part of Sub/Sab.) Closing things off on the Plaza, we have the Brazilian drum and dance ensemble that always plays at the North Country Fair, Quente Samba Amore, who will lead a samba line from the Plaza to the ballpark, where the Crabs will be heading into the second game in a double header. Fireworks follow.  
<p>
Elsewhere in Arcata, specifically at the D St. Neighborhood Center, from 10 a.m.-1 p.m., the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom hosts an "Interdependence Day" Brunch (and book sale) with music by Marianne and Maria and The Raging Grannies. Since my mom is one of the Grannies (she's actually a great-granny) I'll have to stop by.
<p>There was a time when Blue Lake's finest groove-rock band Kulica played every Thursday night at Six Rivers Brewing. They return to their roots Friday playing for a Six Rivers all-day Fourth-o-July bash that includes St. John and the Sinners and four other bands.
<p>
There's also the usual food, art, etc. all along Second Street in Eureka's Old Town on the Fourth with music on several stages, although I can't tell you exactly who. 
<p>
And for those looking for something more traditional and patriotic, Ferndale has its annual parade down Main and a Celebrate America! musical extravaganza at the Ferndale Rep. 
<p>
Don't miss the return of worldly rockers WoMama, fresh from their first tour and ready to "Afrock" the Arcata Farmers' Market Saturday morning. Later they play at Six Rivers as part of a Warriors Walking for Wellness Benefit (I believe connected to Relay for Life) along with the above-mentioned Quente Samba Amore. 
<p>
Saturday at the Alibi it's Humboldt honky tonk and all-American Americana with Rooster McClintock. The music may be country-flavored, but they rock.
<p>
Saturday night at the Jambalaya it's acoustic music on the folky side with Andrew Herringer and Boomsauii. Most of the time it's easy to figure out who musicians are, since they typically leave a trail on the Web. Not so Andrew, who, clues tell me, might be from the Sacramento area. Boomsauii was new to me also; they appear to be local (they have a gig later his month at Mosgo's and play two days at the Humboldt County Fair in August). They have a MySpace, which offers more details (although it only says they're from California and Tennessee, so the localness is a guess). It shows that guitarist Mark, percussionist Dan and bassist Joe share the last name Hays, so we'll assume they're brothers. They use the "about" section of MySpace for an essay explaining the meaning of their name  sort of. After offering a capsule history of man's evolution and civilization in general, they get to a point where, "somewhere in the woods on the side of a hill, three crazy ass-holes are beating on a trampoline and chanting a word that is the product of an anomaly of evolution and society. The product of history and a trillion crossing paths  BOOMSAUII!" As the essay ends you are supposed the give "a slow clap." Don't ask me why. Ask them. 
<p>
The Li'l Red Lion rocks on this week with that Thursday Fire Demons/Tarrakian show mentioned last week, then a Saturday night blast with local loudness from The Zygoats and Tucson indie rockers Mostly Bears, who tell us, "We are a lifeguard, a librarian and a beekeeper's assistant. Our combined age is 67. Our family tree has a John Dillinger branch. We run for the health of it. We did acid for a month last night. We write our letters in octopus ink. Hablamos espanyol, pues, probamos. We always draw a big yellow sun in the top right corner. We are very pleased to meet you. We are Mostly Bears."
<p>
The Red Fox continues its role as reggae-central: Saturday they have Chico's Mystic Roots Band (the guys who have been backing Pato Banton) plus Rude Lion Sound with DJ Jimmy Jonz, the sound-system that plays there most Thursdays. Tuesday, July 8, Bonus brings in Rootz Underground, a hot young six-piece out of Jamaica. Next Thursday, July 10, Proper presents two legendary Jamaican veterans: singer Cornell Campbell and your ace from outer space U-Roy, one of the godfathers of dancehall music, with the usual Rude Lion Sound crew.

When I asked Steve Watts of Passion Presents to send me the line-up for Arcata's Fourth bash (Passion is running the music) he added a note: "Steel Toed Slippers were scheduled, but broke up and cancelled last minute." News to me. I investigated. Apparently the bass player departed suddenly and the Slippers are re-grouping. "Its all good," says band dad Mossman. "Matt [son of Mossman] and Will are moving to LA and they will keep the name Steel Toed Slippers since they are the two original members." So, bass player wanted notices will go out and we'll hear from them again in the future.<p>

The other day I happened to catch the first out-of-the-garage performance of a fine new country-rock band, Cadillac Ranch. They were drummer-less (maybe they still are) and were looking for the right person. I suggested posting something on Craigslist. Wondering if they had, I was looking at the musician listings there this morning and came across this hilarious bit of testosterone: "Seeking Hot Mini Skirt Babe to Front Band: We have a bitchin band with smokin players, doing balls-out hard rock ac/dc sabbath slayer priest etc. Want a hot babe to get up in front scream and dance your ass off in short short tight clothes. Entertain the crowd and the guys playing behind you, it will take a special gal to rock these go-go boots. If you cant sing or hit the high notes, would love to teach you how. Serious pro, drink, no parents either. We got a nice shed for playing in too." OK, I can guess why they don't want a teetotaler, but why the insistence on her being an orphan?
<p>
Coming up next week after all the Independence hoopla has faded, a special visit from a band out of L.A. called, The Kids of Widney High. The Kids are students at J. P. Widney High School, a special education school, where, about 20 years ago, one of the teachers led a songwriting class, then thought it would be cool to have a school rock band. A rotating group of Kids has kept the tradition going since. Teachers and music pros play behind them as the Kids handle vocals on songs about Elvis ("E-L-V-I-S") and my favorite, "Insects." ("You better watch out or the insects will get you!") <p>

The Kids gig regularly in the greater L.A. area at clubs like the Knitting Factory, The Smell and (one of their faves) Mr. T's (a bowling alley). They've opened for numerous bands including The Melvins and Mr. Bungle, count Marilyn Manson and Adam from the Beasties among their fans, and once played a Warped Tour show. 
<p>
This summer, for the first time, they're going on tour. After a stop in S.F., where they play at Amoeba and City Lights Bookstore, they hit Eureka for a couple of days. Tuesday, July 8, they play at the Eureka Library at 6 p.m. then head over to Accident Gallery for an 8 p.m. show. Wednesday, July 9, they're at Old Town Coffee and Chocolates in the afternoon, showtime 2:30 p.m. 
<p>
Give 'em a listen, and show them some respect, which is all they ask when they update the Otis Redding classic (included on their latest disc, Let's Get Busy). "Dont ignore me when you walk by, Im not that different, and thats no lie... You stop and stare, and thats not cool. We have feelings, just like you. All were asking for is a little respect."

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">As reggae fans anxiously await the return of Reggae on the River, happening as an all-day festival on Saturday, July 19th at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area in southern Humboldt, the Mateel Community Center is honored and excited to present a deep and top-class billing of some of the genres freshest and most enduring talent. <p> Although a much different event from the Reggae On The River festivals of recent memory, this community celebration and keep-the-name-alive-forever fundraiser will continue the tradition of great reggae music on the banks of the Eel River.  <p>The Mateel is hopeful for a strong showing of local support as they work to rebuild this community festival and would love to see a sold out event to show the world that the spirit of Reggae On The River is alive and well. <p> Many tickets are still available however, so everyone is encouraged to get theirs today at the usual local outlets and online at www.inticketing.com for a price of $45 MCC members or $50 advance.  Tickets at the gate will be $55.
Gates open at 11am, and will be followed shortly thereafter by an opening ceremony with Native American elder, Coyote Fred Downey.  Arcata-based afrobeat phenomenons, Afromassive, will get the musical festivities started with an energetic set at 11:30am.  <p> Jamaican dancehall diva, Sister I-Live (Peter Toshs niece), plays her acclaimed brand of conscious live dancehall at 12:50pm. <p>  At 2:10pm, Jamaican and local favorite, Stevie Culture, will rock the crowd with his electrifying stage presence with full band support by The Demolition Squad.  Warrior King will follow with his groundbreaking blend of roots and dancehall styles at 3:30pm. <p> New Zealand sensations, Katchafire, will soothe with their infectious island infused reggae at 5:00pm.  <p>At 6:45pm, it will be the roots harmonies of Culture featuring Kenyatta Hill (son of Joseph Hill).  And, closing off the festival will be the legendary vocal group, The Wailing Souls, a set at 8:30pm.  <p>
Additionally, the event will feature 50 vending booths and a lively kid zone.  <p>Camping is available at the Benbow Lake and Richardson Grove campgrounds on a first come, first served basis by calling 800 444-7275.  <p> Free parking is available in Benbow and a limited number of interior venue parking spots will be for sale on the day of the event.  <p>For all other festival info, visit either www.mateel.org or www.reggaeontheriver.com.  <p> You can also call the Mateel office at (707) 923-3368. <p> A very limited number of volunteer positions are still available. Volunteer to help or get your tickets to support today and dont miss the triumphant return of the Mateel Community Centers Reggae On The River at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area on  Saturday, July 19th.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">How would your family like to enjoy four free outings this summer that are guaranteed to please every member, young and old? The McKinleyville Senior Center and the McKinleyville Parks and Recreation have just the ticket for you! We will be presenting our Third Annual Concert in the Park Series every Thursday evening in August. The concerts will be held in Pierson Park adjacent to Azalea Hall on Pickett Road. Each concert will start promptly at 6:00 pm, and will last until 7:30 pm or later, weather permitting. This year we have a very exciting line up of talent offering something for all ages. The well-known bluegrass band The Compost Mountain Boys will start off the Concert Series on Thursday, Aug. 7, 2008. Mr. Calamari will soothe you with Jazz standards on Aug. 14. On Thursday, Aug. 21, Triple Junction will rock you out. Our final concert on Thursday, Aug 28 will feature The Fickle Hill Billies.  All these bands are professional local bands with roots in Humboldt County. Michael Buell of Bay Area Music will make sure that the sound quality of each performance is superb.
<p>
Seniors have long known what it is like to live on a limited budget. Soaring gas and food prices have limited all family budgets, making fun outings almost unattainable. Many families have no entertainment budget at all. We started this event in an attempt to provide affordable entertainment for our community members that is enjoyable for all ages. 
<p>
Spending time with your family, friends and neighbors is essential. The average person spends most of their time working, giving them little family and community time. In a world filled with so many wonderful communication devices (cell phones, blackberries, i-pods, and computers) you would think families and friends would be closer. To the contrary, quite the opposite is true. These devices have distanced us from the old-fashioned closeness people used to attain from getting together with their loved ones and community members at events like this one. You will be able to enjoy a variety of local bands with professional sound without spending a fortune on concert tickets. So, bring your entire family: Grandpa, Grandma, Mom, Dad and all the little ones (both two-legged and four-legged). Bring your lawn chairs, blankets, and your dinner to Pierson Park every Thursday evening in August!
<p>
 We were on the verge of losing our concerts because of last minute funding issues, but as luck would have it, concerned local businesses and individuals came forward to save the concert series, because they felt the need to foster a sense of community in McKinleyville. This years sponsors are: Helping Hands, Humboldt Human Resources, Consumer Credit Counseling Service, Josh Mitchell Construction, The Rocking Horse, North Valley Bank, B&BS Green House, McKinleyville Office Supply, and McKinleyville Area Fund. We would like to thank them all, and a very special thanks goes out to the Sue McCay Family and the Schirmann Families for their support. Without the support of these people, there would not be a concert series this year. All of these individuals are involved in our community and care about its members, both young and old. Many of our sponsors will have tables at the concerts. Stop by and let them know how much you appreciate their support. 
<p>
If you need additional information you can call the McKinleyville Parks and Recreation Department at 839-9003 or the Senior Center at 839-0191. If you would like to have a booth at one of our concerts please contact Danna Bates at 839-5016.

It's a dream for traditional folk musicians: Lark In The Morning Music Celebration is a week-long camp in the Mendocino redwoods with lessons and workshops on all sorts of instruments and traditional styles led by stellar players from around the world, plus dancing, parties and picking sessions everywhere you turn. A fair number of musicians and dancers from Humboldt are there this week. If you just now heard about it and want to go, well, it's too late. It's all sold out. You might think about attending the first week in August next year however.
<p>
So, why mention it here? Lark Camp ends Saturday and the teachers are heading off in various directions. Some are coming through our area and stopping to play. (And some live here.)<p>

First up is a Humboldt Folklife Society show Sunday, Aug. 10, at the Bayside Grange featuring a combo called Verde Gaio from Galicia, a region on the northwest corner of Spain, right above Portugal. Galicia happens to be the home of Manu Chao, but he's not coming here (he is playing at the Outside Lands Festival in Golden Gate Park opening night Aug. 22, along with Beck and Radiohead however). As you might guess from the fact that they're teaching at Lark, Verde Gaio is more on the traditional side of Galician music. <p>

Alexandre Cardosa plays with Xavier Blanco, both are masters of the Galician gaita, a type of bagpipe. Google Xavier and you'll come up with a YouTube vid of a solo performance at a festival in Galicia. As he begins, he's playing some sort of clacking percussion thing and whistles that bring to mind birds in flight. He calls out something in Galician while shaking a bell tied to his arm before squeezing the bag under his other arm and singing a sweet song. Since I don't speak a word of Galician, I have to imagine what it's all about. In my mind it's an ancient song from a shepherd who's coaxing his sheep along a hillside overlooking the sea. Whatever he's singing, it's music full of joy and passion, folk music in its purest form. <p>

Xavier and Alexandre are traveling with fiddler (and gaiteiro) Kevin Carr, a folky from Oregon who I know from his work with Wake the Dead, an all-star Celtic combo that recorded an album of Grateful Dead tunes reimagined as Irish music. There's a clear connection between trad Celtic and Galician music that goes beyond the use of bagpipes, but don't ask me to explain. I'm sure Kevin can do so on Sunday at the Grange. Another person who could probably explain is Greg Moore, who put together the show in Bayside. (He's a teacher at Lark too.) As you might recall, Greg is the leader of Bandemonium, the alt. brass/percussion band that made a splash at the Folklife Festival a couple of weekends back. Bandemonium is opening Sunday's show, and I'm certain if Greg has his way, there will be some kind of collaboration with the pipers taking folk music in wild new directions.   <p>

Humboldt Folklife hosts more Lark musicians the next night, Monday Aug. 11, this time with a show at Humboldt Baykeeper in Old Town. W. Bruce Reid and Bonnie Zahnow hail from Seattle. Local picker David Isley met them up there. He tells me, "They play a lot of old time and jug band music, and both play fiddle, so they do twin fiddle old timey style and some Mexican and Argentine music. Bruce also plays banjo and banjo guitar. He's one of the most amazing musicians I've ever heard." And that's high praise from David, who is an amazing musician himself. See (or hear) for yourself on Friday evening when he's at Rookery Books on the Arcata Plaza as part of Arts! Arcata, or this Thursday when he plays various instruments at Gallagher's taking over for Seabury Gould, who's down at Lark in the Morning.<p>

Incidentally, that same Thursday evening fiddler Tom Rigney and Flambeau are playing Cajun tunes down the way on the Eureka Boardwalk.<p>

I doubt that there's a Lark connection, but Humboldt Brewery has some fine traditional bluegrass coming Sunday night. The Lilly Mountaineers features mandolinist/singer Everett Lilly, a pioneer in bluegrass music who recorded classic tunes back in the day with his brother, Bea, and played with Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys in the '50s. Today he fronts a band with two of his sons Mark and Daniel and several other talented players. If you dig bluegrass, don't miss this one. Humboldt's top bluegrass band The Compost Mountain Boys opens the show.
<p>
When I was working on last week's story about troubles at KHSU, I had occasion to visit the campus office for HSU Advancement. Greeting me from behind a desk was Travis Williams, who asked, "Do you remember me?" "Of course," I replied. When my son was playing percussion in the ArMack Orchestra, Travis was the other percussionist. Now that's he's all grown up, he does database management for Advancement, and he also plays drums for a local band called Hey Eleanor led by his wife, Samantha. Their band is part of a three-band lineup at the Jambalaya Saturday with Double Threat and Oh Foot, a folk/pop duo consisting of Zac Bauman and Maddy Shernock (aka The Beat Nun). Early posters for the Jam show listed former locals The Ian Fays as part of the bill, which is not surprising when you hear the songs on Hey Eleanor's MySpace   The Fays would seem to be an influence on many young local alt. pop singers. (They've delayed their trip back to Humboldt.) BTW, checking Oh Foot's MySpace I learned that Zac and Maddy are both about to move away to the Davis/Sacto, presumably for college. I also discovered that Oh Foot is playing Friday at Mosgo's with Matt Engel. Bouncing over to the Beat Nun Recordings MySpace, I learned that Beat Nun and Oh Foot will be playing live on The Buck Calhoun Show! on KHSU next Wednesday, Aug. 13. Tune in at around 10 p.m. 
<p>
Elsewhere in Arcata the same Saturday night as the Hey/Oh show, The Bump Foundation is once again laying down the funk at Humboldt Brewery. <p>

Earlier Saturday, around 11:30 a.m., you can hear Portland's No Go Know, live in the KSLG studio on Monica Topping's show. I know very little about No Go except that they describe themselves as a "tropical/concrete/zouk" band on MySpace, where their songs either are not posted or don't work. They're in town to fulfill our weekly Portland quota with a show Friday night at the Lil' Red Lion with Pipe(s) Of the Doctor of Witchcraft. It's the first of four shows this week at the hip Eureka nightspot, a space that's been tipping the alt. music scales away from Arcata to Eureka. (See this week's cover story.)<p>

Got a call last week from jazz drummer Michael Curran telling me about the merging of his old Redway business Pomegranate Video with his wife Holly's Persimmon's Garden Gallery. A new wine tasting room replaces the former video store.  "We'll have our grand opening Saturday, Aug. 9," he said, "with the Michael Curran Trio featuring Mary Jo Casasanta  just me and [guitarist] Jim Wilde backing her." The tasting room features wine from SoHum vintners: Briceland Vineyards, Elk Prairie Vineyard and Whitethorn Winery. "And we'll have little plates of food  my wife Holly is a great cook and she also makes these wild herbal infusion drinks," said Michael. The plan is to have music two weekends a month. Next Friday, Aug. 15, Curran assembles another trio with electric bassist Ken Lawrence. Incidentally, you can also hear Curran play with Humboldt Time this Friday Aug. 8, at Cecil's where the jazz band plays once a month.<p>

While looking for horserace post time for the Humboldt County Fair, I came across the listings for the Midway Stage, the one just out the gate from the track. Jimi Jeff and the Gypsy Band play there Thursday, Aug. 7, 5-8 p.m. Then on Friday and Saturday (same time) it's Ferndale resident Elaine Spanky McFarlane of Spanky and Our Gang fame. (Remember "Sunday Will Never Be The Same"?) Sunday through Tuesday they have High Pilots, who seem to play nowhere but county fairs. Then on Wednesday and Thursday ex-Weary Boy Mario Matteoli and friends take the stage. Racetrack admission is free Wednesday, so that might be a good day to hit the Fair. 
<p>
As you know, Reggae Rising was last weekend, and you'd think the major blast of Jah music might slow things, but the reggae shows continue to flow. Humboldt Brews has Woven Roots Thursday followed by a big Friday show with the classic Jamaican harmony trio The Mighty Diamonds. Formed in Trenchtown, Kingston in 1969, the Diamonds are unusual in that the original trio lineup, Donald Tabby Shaw, Fitzroy Bunny Simpson and Lloyd  Judge Ferguson, is still together after all these years. <p>

Then coming to the Red Fox Tavern on Tuesday, Aug. 12, the "More Knowledge Tour" with British reggae toaster Macka B, drummer Wadi Gad, Italian MC International DJ SupaMario and The Roots Ragga Band.<p>

And yes, I was at Reggae Rising  had a blast. Expect a review next week when I'm fully recovered.

Boss Tix Switch
<p>

Posted Thursday, September 06, 2007 at 2:30 am
<p>

The first tickets hadnt even gone on sale for the upcoming Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band tour but that doesnt mean they cant be bought online already.
<p>

Prices on secondary market Web sites such as StubHub have Springsteen tickets going for more than $1,200. From all accounts, the Boss will be structuring his ticket pricing on the low-end of the scale (approximately $55 to $95), with the general admission floor section cheaper (if more desirable) than the surrounding seats.
<p>

The low ends pretty affordable for fans of a rock n roll legend but, then again, Springsteen by his own admission is a rich man in a poor mans shirt. His fans expect blue-collar pricing. Then again, a fan of the Boss might do anything to get those up-close VIP tix.
<p>

The question is, how can there be tickets, however expensive, available online when the presale hasnt even happened yet?
<p>

One Web site, Orderseats.com, even lists Springsteen tickets for various sections of the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Bruce hasnt announced where hes playing in L.A. when he comes to town October 28th, and according to sources, will likely not be playing the Staples Center.
<p>

Yet, section 119, row 18 was selling at press time for $1,181.
<p>

Orderseats.com didn't return a call for comment at press time, but StubHub spokesman Sean Pate explained how things operate on StubHub.com. Turns out, the practice of putting tickets online before a presale is common and StubHub sellers were offering tickets for Springsteen's Oakland, Calif., date 15 days before the presale.
<p>

"This happens for a lot of events, not just concerts," Pate said. "People have either a connection to getting tickets in advance or know theyll have tickets after the fact. Lets say you are a ticket holder at the Oracle Arena. Youll more than likely have an exclusive offer to buy Bruce Springsteen tickets even before a fan club presale. "
<p>

Corporations also sometimes get advance access or own suites and can offer them up for a night.
<p>

Then there are speculators  sellers testing the waters to see what the going rate will be. If several people buy $1,000 Springsteen tickets, or if they dont bite, the sellers can price accordingly after the onsale. Under its terms of agreement, StubHub sellers must provide a buyer with either the ticket purchased or one of equivalent or higher value.
<p>

"Youll see people buying the worst row in a section but knowing theyll get a ticket in that row," Pate said. "In that case, the order still gets filled with a better seat than what you purchased and the seller remains valid through our system. & Any ticket listed on StubHub is guaranteed by our company so a comparable will be offered."
<p>

Meanwhile, Orderseats.com says it has a 100 percent satisfaction policy.
<p>

"This means you are not charged for any tickets unless your order can be successfully filled," the Web site says.

Humboldt Brews on Tuesday August 26th @ 8:30.<p>


 Jimmy Martin, Hank Williams, and the Ramones had a baby.  And its
name is Town Mountain.<p>
  Born out of the all night jam sessions and fertile picking scene
of Asheville, North Carolina, Town Mountain has emerged as one of the
premiere young American bluegrass bands.  Great original material,
tight vocal harmonies, a charismatic stage presence, and instrumental
expertise place this group in the upper tier of contemporary acoustic
bands.  But, in the end, it's always the undeniable, irresistible
energy of a live Town Mountain show that truly sets this group apart.
 <p>  It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that gives Town Mountain
its unique, contagious energy.  It could be the visual performance
that accompanies their great music. The guys bob and weave around each
other, to and from the microphones, in order to facilitate their
surprisingly sophisticated vocal and instrumental arrangements. The
result is a natural choreography, an exciting visual performance that
makes the band almost as fun to watch as it is to listen to.
   Almost.  Town Mountain is monumentally fun to listen to.  This is
the hard-driving, no nonsense, slammin' bluegrass that makes you whoop
and holler and stomp your feet.
  <p> Since winning the 2005 Rockygrass Band Competition, this rowdy
bunch, led by Robert Greer on vocals and guitar, has been playing
some of the best venues and festivals all over the country.  The band
is filled out by Jesse Langlais on banjo, Phil Barker on mandolin,
Barrett Smith on bass, and Merl Johnson on fiddle.
    <p>
   Here's what Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine said about Town
Mountains debut recording "Original Bluegrass and Roots Country":<p>
     "Throughout the production, Town Mountain carries off each
selection with style and perfection and "Original Bluegrass And Roots
Country" is a most impressive recording debut. Expect to see these
guys on the bluegrass scene for a long time."

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Queen Ida plays zydeco, plus back to school, and how to make money with music <p>

When Ida Guillory was growing up in Lake Charles, Louisiana, playing accordion was not considered ladylike. That didn't stop Ida  she would eventually be crowned Queen of the Zydeco Accordion.<p>

"Music  zydeco music  was in my family as long as I can remember. I had two uncles that played accordion and a cousin who played violin," she told me when I called her at home in Daly City, south of San Francisco. 
<p>
After the family moved from Louisiana to Texas, Ida's mother would continue to visit their old home in the bayou. "One time she brought back an accordion. She told my brothers, 'I want you guys to keep the tradition, keep the music going.' At that time the youngsters in Louisiana weren't picking it up. Zydeco wasn't cool. So she brought it home and gave it to the boys. When I was brought up, women didn't play accordion. Violin and piano were fine, but not accordion  that was too masculine."<p>

But, after listening to her brother Al develop his chops on the squeezebox, she decided she'd try it out herself. "I borrowed his accordion and went down to the basement where no one could hear. At first I didn't get it, but I kept trying."
<p>
She didn't really get into playing seriously until years later when her family left their Texas rice farm behind and relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. They weren't the only ones who'd come from Cajun country in East Texas and Louisiana. And when Ida married a Texan in 1950, they started having zydeco parties at home.<p>

"We started with basement parties, then through word of mouth they got larger and larger, and finally we started renting a hall," she recalled. "At that time I wasn't playing much. My brother had a band, but I was still trying to learn." 
<p>
At some point she started taking a turn on the bandstand on a few songs. At one show, where a reporter happened to be in attendance for a piece on the Bay Area Creole culture, she was introduced, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, as "The Queen of Zydeco." From the point when that was reported in the paper, she was "Queen" Ida. 
<p>
In the '70s, a resurgence of interest in traditional culture brought in new crowds and the band started playing the club circuit. They made a few records, even won a Grammy. <p>

Her brother, Al Rapone, has since moved back to Louisiana. Ida now works with a band that includes two of her sons, one on rub-board, another on accordion, so she can just sing on some songs. The music maintains its Cajun/Creole roots, but is a bit less traditional than it was in the beginning. 
<p>
"Gumbo is the word for it," says Ida (who is also author of a Cajun cookbook). "It's traditional zydeco as well as other things we throw in the pot: a little bit of country-western, a little bit of blues, even some Caribbean music. It's all that. And people seem to like it."
<p>
Ready for some of Queen Ida's tasty musical gumbo? She's in town Sunday for a set at the Organic Planet Festival. Details on the rest of the event can be found in this week's calendar section. Queen Ida and her Zydeco Band should hit the stage at around 3:30, right after the samba parade. Stop on by.<p>

You say you can't get enough of that accordion music? Wednesday, Aug. 27, CenterArts brings America's No. 1 rock/pop parodist Weird Al Yankovic to the Van Duzer stage for a multi-media show  and you know what? Al got his start as a SoCal teenager sending twisted accordion versions of rock hits to Dr. Demento, and the squeezebox is still his main instrument. Al's been doing OK: His most recent album, Straight Outta Lynwood, and its hit single, White and Nerdy, have taken him to new platinum heights, even the ringtone was certified gold.
<p>
There's the usual Farmers' Market on the Arcata Plaza Saturday, once again with old timey gospel by Huckleberry Flint. Then around the time the farmers are wrapping up, Concerts on the Plaza fires up with Marin's Latin/worldbeat/funk/jamband Vinyl, who also play later in the evening at the Red Fox Tavern. Local funkateers The Bump Foundation open the Red Fox show.<p>

Also on Saturday, an amazing Canadian vocal ensemble called Chic Gamine stops off for a local house concert on their way to the Strawberry Music Festival. Based in Winnipeg's French Quarter, the group includes four women vocalists and one guy on percussion creating music that initially reminded me of early Zap Mama. (My wife says Camille, either way, great stuff.) It's fairly likely that the show will be sold out by the time you read this, but you can e-mail Joel Sonenshein (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="abc1c4cec7ebcad8c2d885c8c4c6">[email&#160;protected]</a>) to check, and/or to get on the e-list for future house concerts.

The setting in the inn's courtyard couldn't be better with friends gathering to enjoy cocktails, good food and wine  and world-class jazz  as the stars come out. As noted last week, they have guitarist Lee Waterman and Jazz Caliente coming in this Thursday. Friday, pianist Larry Vuckovich leads a Latin combo that includes Buca Necak on bass, Paul Van Wageningen on drums with Hector Lugo on Latin-style percussion. Vuckovich returns Saturday without Hector, but with Jackie Ryan doing her vocalese thing. Sunday it's bassist Chris Amberger leading a duo. Tuesday, Aug. 26, the fine local vocalist Mary Jo Casasanta fronts a quintet. Wednesday, Aug. 27, Eric Shifrin is up from San Francisco to play the Inn's grand piano. Humboldt Time returns Thursday Aug. 28. The series closes out next weekend with the Wayne Wallace Latin Quintet on Friday, Aug. 29; followed by a Saturday, Aug. 30, show with Akira Tana and Sound Circle featuring former local Randy Porter on piano with special guest Maria Volonte on vocals. If you dig jazz, well, it's well worth the drive south. Head on down.
<p>
The Lil' Red Lion just keeps on (alt.) rockin'. Thursday they have über-cool alt. something band Indian Jewelry on the "West Co$t" leg of "Che's Funky Bolivian Expedition 2," plus Sweaty Sweaters, an instrumental prog trio from Bellingham, and James Harkins' zombie-surf-emo band The Invasions, perhaps that band's last show. Friday gets loud with San Fran's self-described "drunk punk" combo The Bar Feeders, heading home from something called Total Fest in Montana and probably hung over. They're here with another Frisco punk outfit, The Penny Dreadfuls (formerly known as NNP). Saturday it's groovy, lo-fi, Beatle-esque Portland duo BoomSnake sharing a bill (if not an aesthetic) with Idyllwild punks Liquid Wagon. The Lil' Red action resumes Tuesday with more neo-prog by La Fin du Monde out of Chico plus Portland's System and Station, who are on the road with a brand new CD, A Nation of Actors.
<p>
Fortuna may have lost its all-ages haven Out of the Sun, but the scensters persevere. Monday, Aug. 25, they're throwing an end-of-summer back-to-school all-ages punk rock bash at the Fortuna Vet's Hall with four bands: Nural, The Material, A Farewell Device and This Dying Wish. 
<p>
And so it begins. With the students back in town, CenterArts kicks of its new season Tuesday with two shows at once. Aussie folk rockers The Waifs are in the Van Duzer playing tunes like the title track from their fine new album, sundirtwater: "Well if your holding out on something, then just reach and we'll rise above  give me Sun, give me Dirt, give me Water, give me sweet everlasting love." Meanwhile in the Kate Buchanan Room British roots Rastas Steel Pulse lay down some serious reggae led by the dreadlocked David Hinds.
<p>
Then Thursday HSU's Associated Students take over with HumWeek 2008 (apparently named in tribute to this column) with Ozomatli, Brett Dennen, !!! and Upright Citizens Brigade. More details next week. Advance warning from Mike Dronkers: "Brett Dennen will perform live on KHUM 104.3/104.7 during the noon hour on Thursday, August 28."
<p>
Between the free exchange of music in the digital age and the rising cost of touring, how does a musician make a living? That question arose when I talked with Jason Munning, lead guitarist for the San Francisco-based folk/country/rock band Ten Mile Tide. Jason and his twin brother Justin are out front in the band, who have a sound that reminds me of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. (Jason had not heard of them.) The money thing came up because I noticed that all of the bands recordings were available as free downloads on their website. 
"I wonder how independent bands ever did it," said Jason. "Everyone talks about how file-sharing make it hard for musicians to make money, but the fact is, as an independent band, if we hadn't given our music away for free, people wouldn't have heard of us and no one would be buying our CDs. We went the other extreme and promoted giving the music away: Download it, burn it, post it, whatever. That model might scare some record labels, but it's brought us a following. Believe it or not people still buy our records from the website, to give as gifts or maybe just to support us. We found that it increased our touring income. That's where bands make most of their money today."
He admits that it's harder with current fuel prices. "We focus on anchor dates, private shows, weddings, or festivals where we make more money. At this point we have those coming in. It would have been hard to start off cold, and the truth is, we're still trying to figure out how to make it all work."
Wanna do your part? Ten Mile Tide plays Friday at the Red Fox Tavern. Pay that cover and don't spend too much on drinks. Buy the damned CD after the show so they can fill the gas tank.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Inaugural Biannual Music Festival <p>September 5, 6, and 7, 2008
<p>
HUMBOLDT COUNTY, CALIFORNIA  <p>While not always acclaimed for their role in rock and rolls underground music scene, Humboldt County has a proud history of churning out some of the best psychedelic rock music north of San Francisco.  And in an effort to celebrate Humboldts rich music tradition, a handful of local musicians, artists, and promoters have decided to organize and present The Future is Unwritten music festival. <p>

This first biannual fest will feature a number of psychedelic and psych-influenced performers from up and down the West Coast, including such local acts as Yer Dog and White Manna, as well as Portland Oregons Datura Blues. Festival organizers are also excited to present a handful of national acts, with the likes of Mammatus, Nebula, and Totimoshi all performing over the course of the weekend. <p>

Details of the shows are as follows:
<p>
Chapter One of this years festival will be written Friday, September 5at Big Petes Pizzeria on G Street in Arcata with local psych-rockers Yer Dog and White Manna kicking off festivities with a special all ages performance. Organizers feel that making live music accessible to listeners of all ages is important to the fests success and to Humboldts music scene in general. Big Petes vested interest in providing live music for all of his patrons figured greatly into making the decision to have this venue be part of the festival. Those over 21 need not despair, for beer will still be served with proper identification. Pizza will be available to all. The door will be $5, with music starting shortly after 10pm. <p>

Chapter Two of the festival will take place Saturday, September 6 at the Alibi in Arcata with Mammatus and Datura Blues. Mammatus hails from outside Santa Cruz, California and has created quite a buzz over the past couple of years with their fuzzed-out and somewhat demented live performances. The success of two releases on Holy Mountain Records has gained them national attention and landed them an opening slot for Acid Mothers Temple on their 2007 United States tour. Datura Blues, whose formative roots can be traced back to a cold and stormy night in Humboldt County, will open the show with their unique blend of psychedelic madness, one that incorporates elements of folk, punk, krautrock, and improvisational jams into the mix.   The groups latest creation Is it as it is, Brother? will be out in late August and available at the show. Cover for this show will be $5. It is a 21+ event, with doors opening at 10:30pm and music starting shortly after 11pm.<p>

Chapter Three brings the festival to Aunty Mos in Eureka on Sunday, September 7 and will feature Nebula and Totimoshi. Southern Californias Nebula are veterans of the psych/stoner rock scene and are well renowned for their mesmerizing live sets, which are highlighted by guitarist Eddie Glasss blistering and spaced-out guitar jams. The bands catalog includes a variety of releases, including well-received efforts on Sub Pop, Tee Pee, and Mans Ruin. This will be Nebulas first visit to Humboldt County, one that is sure to long endure in the minds of those who attend. Incidentally, Nebulas latest effort is titled Heavy Psych and will be available at the show.  The Bay Areas Totimoshi will also be featured on Sunday nights event, and while it may be a stretch to say the power trio is psych-influenced, their latest release Milagrosa does find the band edging closer to some straight-up jams. Totimoshi have been busy lately, touring with the likes of Helmet, Mastodon, and the Melvins, as well as signing to Volcom Records. Local hard rockers Machete round out the bill and will certainly open the night with a loud bang and wallop. The show is a 21+ affair and will be $8. Doors open at 9pm with bands beginning at 10pm.  <p>

Festival organizers intend to present The Future is Unwritten again in the Spring of 2009 with the hopes that it can become part of local music tradition each year during the vernal and autumnal equinox.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">STRATOSPHEERIUS TO PLAY EUREKA, SEPTEMBER 9<p>
(Jam/fusion/rock/jazz/progressive/singer-songwriter group will be doing a show at The Red Fox Tavern)
<p>
Stratospheerius will be performing at the Red Fox Tavern, 415 Fifth Street, in Eureka, on September 9.  The venue phone number is 707-269-0282, and admission is 10 dollars. 
  <p>
Stratospheerius is playing its first tour of California this September.  While lead singer/violinist/mandolinist Joe Deninzon has toured California as both a solo act and with other artists, the group is excited to play a number of west coast dates for the first time in its seven year career.     <p>

In addition to Joe, Stratospheerius' members are Aurelien Budynek (guitars, vocals), Jamie Bishop (bass) and Lucianna Padmore (drums).
<p>
The band's musical range combines jam, fusion, rock, progressive, virtuoso, singer-songwriter, jazz and metal, and describes itself as "psychojazz trip funk."  Stratospheerius has played at colleges, festivals, and clubs throughout the US. The New York-based group has opened for Tim Reynolds, Mickey Hart, The Slip, Ekoostik Hookah, and John Scofield.  The group was a winner in the John Lennon Songwriting Competition, won the Online People's Choice Awards in the Cornucopia Festival, and was named "Best Jam Band" in Musician's Atlas Independent Music Awards. 
<p>
Some of the dates will be in the V3 tour with other violinist-led bands, including Jesus Florido on September 3 at The Temple Bar in Santa Monica and September 11 at Di Piazza's in Long Beach.
<p>
Stratospheerius' album, HEADSPACE combines elements of hard rock, jazz, funk, and Middle Eastern music.  "Today is Tomorrow," "New Material" and "Old Ghosts" have garnered airplay on all kinds of radio formats.  The instrumental "Heavy Shtettle Part II: Heavier Shtettle," which Joe co-wrote with Testament's Alex Skolnick is finding its way on both jazz and metal radio formats.
<p>
Support for the band from fans, radio, and media has been significant.  CASHBOX writer Justin Scro reviews, "Stratospheerius is creating a genre of its own," and "the vocal performance of Joe Deninzon is on par with his stringed abilities."   THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER praises Stratospheerius for its "funky electric violins, driving guitar rhythms, and fevered drumming layered in an explosive fashion." 
<p>
Other outlets have been praising the group for not fitting into one genre.  Mark Kirby of MUSIC DISH NETWORK writes, "Stratospheerius' music has smarts, but not of the cold calculating kind; the music has rawness and intensity, but not the stupid punk kind. Statospheerius have a band sound that avoids the pitfalls of jazz, while keeping its sophistication and musical depth."  COSMOS GAMING's Chris Dahlberg says, "Stratospheerius is an impressive group, and HEADSPACE continues to see them progressing further and further in both technical prowess and original ideas.  There are other groups that try to work string instruments in like this one has, but no one else has the ability to switch up genres like Stratospheerius."

This band from Australia, Live @ Sub's, is playing Humbrews on Thursday, Sept 4. Local band, Silent Giants, are opening.
<p>
They come from the East of Melbourne, Australia where the hills are big and the beats are even bigger. Following up their previous EP 'Memoirs Of An Ashtray', Live@Subs returned with the new EP Holiday in Japan fortified with the title track which has been receiving some huge support from Triple J. In keeping with their cheeky nature and definite influences from the likes of Sublime, Bob Marley & The Chilli Peppers, the Holiday In Japan single is all about living the good life and along with five other killer tunes the EP is chockfull of funk-filled riffs and reggae-rockn beats. 
<p>
Each descending from their own separate musical backgrounds, Live@Subs is an interesting combination of life long musicians. From that of Guitarist/Singer Sub who played with US group The Toledo Show, touring the US during 1997 & 1998, followed by an Australian tour in late '98 finishing at the Byron Bay Blues and Roots Festival. Or Deef Live@Subs drummer/singer, x-drummer of heavy grooves band Another Race (aka Biscuit), and bassist Wingman. Now playing together after knowing each other since they were in school, "the Subs" boys take a somewhat different approach to their music, enjoying each gig, recording session and tour as one big party/a way of life! 
<p>
Another highlight for the band was featuring on the new Triple J "Like a version 2" compilation CD with a JJJ live studio recording of "Roll Up" originally by the Long Beach Dub All-Stars. 
<p>
2007-2008 has seen L@S tour extrensively around Australia and also their first US tour of California and Nevada. The lads are now back in the studio recording their 5th Record, with the aim of getting it out early 2008 while summer is still with us that dwell south of the equator!

<p>
Cubensis is playing Humbrews on Friday & Saturday, Sept 5 & 6.
<p>
Since 1986, Los Angeles-based band Cubensis has carried the torch in celebration of one of Americas most beloved touring bands, the Grateful Dead. Cubensis sets out to re-create the Grateful Dead experience by emulating the sounds of Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and the rest of the legendary San Francisco jam band. Cubensis plays complete shows covering all eras of the Grateful Dead, and no night is ever the same. Cubensis is far more than just your standard cover band as they bring the magic and sounds to those longing for the live vibe that only the Grateful Dead was able to deliver. "This is not imitation," cautions lead guitarist Craig Marshall, "This is the real deal. We're satisfying our musical curiosities like they did, by exploring improvisational frontiers. When you take a musical leap of faith, sometimes you land on the rocks, but sometimes you fly."

 <p>

Cubensis performs its critically acclaimed live performance of Grateful Dead show recreations to audiences and venues all over the western United States. Giving homage in a continually evolving artistic outlet, the band recreates the Grateful Dead experience with compelling authenticity. Like the Dead, the band explores and searches out all the possibilities of the music. 

 <p>

The group is drawing national attention with their true-to-life performances. LA Weekly recently raved "Cubensis plays with the same laid-back mastery as the real McCoy." Big Brother skateboard magazine says Cubensis is "the nations premiere Dead tribute" and the OC Weekly declared them "the hottest Grateful Dead tribute act going." OC Register affirmed Cubensis was "the best place to channel Jerry Garcia" and AOL Citybeat stated, Cubensis is renown for whipping its faithful crowd into a swirling, psychedelic mass for three hours straight.
<p>
 

Each night, Cubensis decides on performing songs from the hundreds that the Grateful Dead performed during their 30-year tenure as fathers of improvisational rock. As a chamber orchestra interprets Bach or Mozart, Cubensis presents a completely spontaneous set list, song by song, with uncanny faithful interpretation. Audience members encourage the band by calling out requests for favorite tunes. The band performed their 2000th show during the 2005 summer tour. 

 <p>

The group has its craft so well refined that even members of the Grateful Dead themselves, such as keyboardists Vince Welnick and Tom Constanten, have appeared on stage and performed with these live music interpreters. Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir praised the band, saying, Just love what you do...and of course, you do!

 
<p>
Cubensis dips into every incarnation of the Dead, so most fans can "see" shows that happened long before they were born. All eras of the Dead and the Jerry Garcia Band are represented. As with the originators, improvisation is key, so every nights performance is unique and memorable. 

 <p>

In celebrating the Grateful Dead concert experience, the band performs a wondrous amalgam of blues, country, jazz, electronic and rock and roll music, all in the space of about three hours on stage. As with all improvisational jambands, every Cubensis performance is an ongoing experiment, and is closely tied to the boundless energy of the Deadicated fans. No set list is ever repeated, no tune ever played without true improvisational passion, no fan left unsatisfied. Each and every experience is unique... as it was MEANT to be. Truly, there is nothing like a Cubensis show!!

 <p>

In addition to regional touring with numerous sold out shows, Cubensis continued their commitment to community service in August, when they performed a benefit show in partnership with the Rex Foundation, a non-profit, charitable organization established in 1983 by friends and members of the Grateful Dead, to further the organization's philanthropic goals. Money raised at the benefit concert was contributed directly to the Rex Foundation which provided grants to area community groups and non-profits.

  <p>

In 2006, the band plans to tour fulltime with some 150 dates per year spread across the southwest from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe, San Diego, Phoenix and Las Vegas. The last several years have seen them playing at medium to large sized theatres joined by special guests such as Vince Welnick of the Dead, Chris Robinson and Marc Ford of the Black Crowes, Warren Haynes of Allman Brothers fame, Garcia collaborator David Nelson, and Barney Doyle of the Mickey Hart Band. 

 <p>

Cubensis's authenticity and popularity is possible because of the Dead's fervent fans, called Deadheads, who followed the group from show to show, who have now latched on to Cubensis. Unlike most bands, the Dead allowed its fans to tape performances. The tapes have been archived, and a data base called DeadBase lists the order of songs done at every show. Thus, the bands appearances and performances are highly anticipated.

 <p>

The band doesn't reproduce the Grateful Dead's songs note for note---though it would be hard for most listeners to tell. The Dead's music is highly improvisational, with rock, country and jazz influences. Cubensis members say there's room for interpretation while staying true to the original. Its all about tapping into the same inspirational flow, says Cubensis guitarist Craig Marshall. Dead guru Jerry Garcia granted Marshall permission to recreate the Deads music, as long as he "did a good job" of it. I told him we played all Grateful Dead songs, recounts Marshall, to which Garcia replied, in mock surprise, Oh yeah? So do we!

 <p>

Even the press has caught on to what they're trying to do. LA Times observed, As the tribute to one of the ultimate jam bands, their set lists are as free and frollicky as the crowd. Big Brother skateboard magazine did a feature piece on Cubensis in its January 2002 issue and various newspapers and online publications have consistently praised the band, and its mellow but fanatical following. In the end, what Cubensis does is not just a tribute to the Grateful Dead but a testament to the enormous number of unique setlists they performed in their long career. Cubensis seizes the framework of the original music and sees how much further it can be taken.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>RANDS LIFE ON DISPLAY AT HUMBREWS </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">
<p>On a recent summer tour, Joanne Rand had a special performer on stage with her.
	
<p>Her nine-year-old daughter Georgia.
	
<p>She was on stage dancing with me, dance that tells stories of the songs, Rand said. It was really a wonderful feeling to see that happen. I felt like a plant and she was the flower.
	
<p>Rand performs at Humboldt Brews for the first-ever HumTunes event, a free made-for-TV performance on Tuesday, Sept. 2. Although her daughter is not scheduled to be dancing on stage, Rands life story, told in the nine CDs of her music, will be on display. 
	
<p>Each disc is a different chapter:
	
<p>The sister who honors her brothers explosion of creativity near the end of his life, tragically shortened by AIDS, in the compelling The Monkey Puzzle, which is perhaps her masterpiece.
	
<p>Her daughters birth inspired another disc, Family History. 
	
<p>Its my favorite album, she said. It also tells the story of my ancestors. Its a mix of quiet songs and more rockin type stuff. And its more personal.
	
<p>Songs born in the wilderness, along the Klamath and Salmon rivers, in Where Our Power Lies.

<p>	Through it all, Rand, 47, feels that her lifes purpose is as a midwife of sorts.
	
<p>I want to change the world, she said. I want to help move people across borders; borders of the mind, feelings that happen in transition.
	
<p>Her most recent CD, Broken Open, is a solo endeavor, the tracks put down last winter. Later this fall she will start re-recording some of those songs and new ones with her band, The Rhythm of the Open Hearts.
	
<p>She is proud of her heritage, a mixture of Southern gentility and Appalachian mountain folk. Yet she didnt stay close to home.

<p>	I left Georgia as a teenager because I didnt fit in, she said. I made a big zig-zag across the country over a number of years and ended up in the west.

<p>	Why does she live in Humboldt - or more generally, the northwest between northern California and southern Oregon?
	
<p>The greatest concentration of shakers and movers are here and the wilderness is here, she said. Its mostly the people. I love the southwest but every time I go there, I know why Im living here. This is where the activists live.

<p>	Activists like her husband, Greg King, a well-known environmental advocate. And Rand herself.
	
<p>Rands aspirations as a shy young adult began with creative writing, but then she decided to go to art school. After that, massage school. 
	
<p>Finally, in her mid-20s, she embraced her musical abilities.
	

<p>What I had to say was more important than my ego telling myself that my songs were not good enough, she said.
	
<p>Along with creating music and performing, Rand has again tapped into her healing arts background. I feel like it has taken me all there years to realize that what I really like the most is to help people, she said.
	
<p>She has returned to massage therapy, working at a couple of area clinics. Its a great balance for the music because its about listening to the other person.
	
<p>Rand is also at work on a music composition degree at Humboldt State University.
	
<p>But its family and nature that form the strongest threads in the fabric of her life, woven together by music.
	
<p>When I was a kid there was this tree that Id make a pilgrimage to and play music for it, she said. When I got in sight of the tree, I couldnt speak. I just had to play for it.
	
<p>One day, her daughter may turn that story into a dance.
	
<p>NOTE: Joanne Rand and Robert Franklin take to the stage at HumBrews on Tuesday, Sept. 2, for the inaugural made-for-TV HumTunes video shoot. The show will debut on Ch. 12 (Access Humboldt) on Sept. 13 at 10-11 p.m.

	<p>One of Humboldts most talented, exuberant and poignant singers does not play a musical instrument. Nor does she read music.

	<p>A lot of my songs are a little angry, she said, adding with a laugh, If I had better choice in men, it might might not have been that way. If you listen to my songs, the first ones especially,  it sounds like Im pissed off. And I was out there with my pissed-offed-ness.
	<p> I met a wonderful man a few years ago, she said of husband Steve, and I havent written a damn song since.  My friends call him the career killer. 
	<p>Happiness, she said, is a narrower market.
	<p>A government employee, there is a reason why she has a day job.
	<p>When you try to turn your art into industry, you compromise a lot, she said. When I do it on this level, I feel a lot more control and what I sing about is on a level that Im passionate about.
	<p>Her biggest musical influence and inspiration has been Scott Baker, her father.
From a family in Humboldt County for three generations, Baker said, The only people I consider locals are native Americans. 
	<p>She has three published CDs. The most recent is a12-song series about an unrequited love. Still Feel You, with the Sari Baker Trio.
	<p>Her first album, Mad Woman Blues, was produced by Eldin Green, who owns the humboldtmusic.com website. Eldin was awesome, someone willing to help me make my first CD. He had his own ideas but it was always my call about what to release with my name on it.
	<p>Her second disc True  with Mike Craghead, the songs were still about bad experiences with men she loved. Its my motto, hurt me and Ill write something pretty, she said.
	<p>Now her focus has changed. Her songs are less about ill-fated love and more about social injustices.
	<p>Politics can often replace love as far as song material goes. Ive branched out. I started focusing on other things, she said.
	<p>I moved into Eureka a few years ago, and I live on what the police refer to as Heroin Alley. It has exposed me to a lot of issues in our society; the distribution of wealth and the general apathy of people have come up in inconvenient and upsetting ways. People can not go around and ignore it and be in bubble about gas prices and food prices ... and all of the problems with the system.
	<p>With an offbeat and irreverent sense of humor to balance her passion for social justice, Sari Baker likes to lampoon the uppity. Thats why she reads Vogue, for the ardent pretencia of it all.
	<p>Pretencia?
	<p>The pretension of Vogue does require a certain amount of devotion, she said after reading a hilariously inane selection from the magazine. Sometimes its refreshing to put life in perspective. There are so many NOT important things that people choose to care about.
<p>	Among her talents, Baker is a good driver who can handle a stick shift.
	<p>And Im really good at parallel parking, she said. Im proud of that.
	<p>NOTE: Sari Baker with Mike Craghead will perform at Humboldt Brews in Arcata on Tuesday, Sept. 2, for the inaugural videotaping of HumTunes, a live music TV show featuring North Coast area artists. HumTunes can be seen on Access Humboldt Ch. 12 Saturdays 10-11 p.m. and Wednesdays 6-7 p.m. beginning Sept. 13.

We are excited to present the band, LOTUS, one of the hottest acts to combine jam, indie and electronica. Watch out for them on the Arlo Forest Stage on Sunday night. They will also be playing songs from their long awaited new album HAMMERSTRIKE, which is due for release this fall. <P>
For those waiting for a concert experience with the dynamics of a rock band, the dance inducing rhythms of club music, and the sophistication of modern electronica, an unlikely musical alternative has arrived in the form of the band Lotus. Formed in 1999, Lotus has spawned a massive following of fans. The five-piece band has creatively fused electronic dance music with instrumental post-rock for eight years. The result is an explosive live show that has excited crowds across the US, Canada, and Japan. 
<P>
Due to be released this fall, the new album from Lotus, Hammerstrike, finds the band reaching back in order to move forward.  The compositions are focused and melodic, filled out with orchestration including swelling violins and cellos, banjo, wordless choirs, and electronic noises.  Though the tracks range from dance floor ready rockers to soaring post-rock instrumentals, the album is held together by a sanguine spirit pervading each track.  The big guitars, feedback, and distortion serve an optimistic purpose.<P>
"The Synchronized Global Ma". This year, in every Earthdance location, the "Prayer for Peace" will be followed by the tone of MA (pronounced Maah), as people across the world synchronize their voices with the intention of healing the Earth. The vowel sound of "Ma" is common in many international languages to represent the sound for Mother and in many spiritual disciplines is the sound that activates the heart center. To increase cohesiveness and provide a single, specific point of focus for the global community, the "Prayer for Peace" will be immediately followed by a recording of a fundamental tone (the specific human frequency of 125hz), which will serve as a foundation note for people to tune into. The note is also based on the Schumann Resonance, which is the consistant tone emitted by our planet as discovered by Nasa. Thus, we will be uniting our intention and voices to heal our planet using the actual tone that our planet is vibrating at.!!!!<P>
Does your car have two people and four seats? Or even better -- Leave your car home! We are encouraging all Earthdancers to please car pool to help our festival stay green and to help YOU save money and gas. Visit our online ride share board to hook up with folks needing a lift, or to advertise empty seats in your vehicle. Our easy to use system also allows you to find people who match your interests.

ORANGE BLOSSOMS features 11 original JJ Grey compositions (and one cover) that come right out of the Southern musical tradition. Following up on the major success of Grey's last Alligator album, COUNTRY GHETTO (and the reissue of the band's first two releases, 2001's BLACKWATER and 2004's LOCHLOOSA), ORANGE BLOSSOMS is a groove-driven, soulful masterpiece.

Like Florida's state flower, the orange blossom, songwriter/vocalist/multi-instrumentalist JJ Grey's songs are fascinating, beautiful, and complex. Both are products of the same ground: the rich, fertile and ancient soil of the Sunshine State. Born and raised just outside of Jacksonville, Florida, Grey comes from a long tradition of Southern musical storytellers and, like the best of the great Southern writers, he fills his songs with details that are at once vivid and personal, political and universal. His multi-textured music overflows with dynamic rhythms and thought-provoking lyrics. From raw funk to deep soul, blues and rock, JJ and his band Mofro deliver devastating live and recorded performances. Blues Revue says the band plays "irresistible North Florida roots, soul and blues....Joyous, funky grooves and gritty, mesmerizing lyrics."  <p>
ORANGE BLOSSOMS, produced by long-time cohort Dan Prothero and Grey, was recorded in north Florida and boasts some of Grey's most profound and moving music to date. The album features 12 songs (including 11 Grey originals) inspired by Grey's life experiences and visionary observations. With long-time friend and guitarist Daryl Hance, bassist/organist Adam Scone, drummer Anthony Cole, and the Hercules Horns of saxophonist Art Edmaiston and trumpeter Dennis Marion, Grey moves effortlessly from gospel-tent fervor to Southern-fried rockers to deeply emotional soul. ORANGE BLOSSOMS is fueled by JJ's gritty, smoldering vocals and intense, funk-infused guitar and keyboard work. Relix raved, saying, "Grey and Mofro fuse rock with plenty of soul and groove-heavy blues, and dirty, infectious funk. The deep and introspective lyrics are a breath of fresh air."  
Debuting in 2001 with BLACKWATER, following up in 2004 with LOCHLOOSA, Grey steadily built an intensely loyal following through constant touring. In 2007, with his first Alligator release, COUNTRY GHETTO, Grey reached an even larger audience, doubling both his album sales and his concert attendance. Now, with his new album, ORANGE BLOSSOMS, JJ Grey takes another giant step forward.  <p>
From gritty funk and juke joint romps to contemplative country soul and blistering rockers, Grey's music is in a class by itself, at once contemporary and classic. Now, with his latest release, ORANGE BLOSSOMS, JJ Grey will bring his singular musical vision and hip-shaking, soulful live show to his ever-growing fan base, showing how his songs speak to people all over the world and how far-reaching his Southern roots can spread.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">The Future is Unwritten music festival and other psychedelia

 <P>

Psychedelic: It's a word that conjures images of stoned '60s-style hippies with flowers in their hair noodle dancing to endless guitar solos. My New Oxford American Dictionary tells me it's an adjective "relating to or denoting drugs that produce hallucinations and apparent expansion of consciousness" and also "a style of rock music originating in the mid-1960s, characterized by musical experimentation and drug-related lyrics," or "denoting or having an intense, vivid color or a swirling abstract pattern: a psychedelic T-shirt," or let's just say tie-dye.
<P>
I'm not sure how the word is defined by the organizers of the first ever The Future is Unwritten music festival. They declare, "Humboldt County has a proud history of churning out some of the best psychedelic rock music north of San Francisco," and they're celebrating that "rich music tradition," with a fest spanning three days and three venues with seven bands total: three out-of-towners, three locals, one ex-local. <P>

At Sunday's Willie Nelson show I ran into Jeff and Roshawn, two members of Machete, who play a Sunday show as part of the F/U festival. When I mentioned the psyche fest, they were confused. "We are not a psychedelic band," they said in no uncertain terms. Like a machete, the band is metal, hard sharp metal.    
<P>
"It's a loose term, but, yeah, we're psychedelic," said Pete Ciotti, guitarist for Yer Dog, who play the fest's first night. "I'd say we fall into the category, kind of in a Neil Young psychedelic style." The band started out playing country-ish rock a la Wilco or Exile-era Stones, then mutated into a spacier zone, but Pete and bassist Pat Quinn are the only carryovers from the original Y-Dog. "This is a new version of the band," said Pete, "new line-up, new CD in the works, slightly new sound." Yer Dog plays Friday, Sept. 5, for "Chapter One" of The Future is Unwritten in an all-ages bash at Big Pete's with another Arcata band, White Manna, who self-identify on MySpace as "garage/psychedelic/other." 
<P>
F/U moves to the Alibi Saturday for Chapter Two, with Ryan Jones returning to his old digs with the latest incarnation of the amorphous drone/psyche/ambient combo Datura Blues and a new album, Is it as it is, Brother? D.B. is paired with Mammatus from "the outer reaches of Santa Cruz County." As the band explains it, "Mammatus harness[es] instruments and amplifiers with the brave intent of transforming the natural beauty and massive fury that lies in the earth into acoustic energy. The sound that results from these explorations is an aural adventure, a sonic quest through the outer reaches of the natural and spiritual worlds." Hmm, sounds psychedelic to me.<P>

Sunday, Chapter Three takes the fest to Aunty Mo's, where the above-mentioned Machete opens for Bay Area-heavyweights Totimoshi and the SoCal band Nebula. Totimoshi plays intense hard rock with slashing guitar lines that might be described as Latino grunge if there was such a genre. They're on the road with Nebula, led by guitar jammer Eddie Glass, the band that perhaps defines the notion behind the festival. Nebula's latest release, Heavy Psyche is along stoner rock lines  (see review on page ??), an evolution of metal into a spacey netheregions intended to take the listener on a trip of some sort. To where? That's up to you. 
<P>
Absynth Quintet, named for a mind-altering liqueur, celebrate their new CD, Indigo Shoes, with an extravaganza at the Jambalaya Friday (see review on page ??). The plan for the show, says Ryan Roberts: "We are going to play the whole album backwards." And yes, satanic messages will be revealed. Saturday at the Jam: Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, a big time "jazz/electronica/psychedelic" band, who I'd describe as a tripped-out jamband. 
<P>
Meanwhile, Humboldt Brews has a Friday/Saturday run by Cubensis, from SoCal, who I'm told is one of the top Grateful Dead tribute bands around.
<P>
Following last year's annual KMUD Lu'ah, organizers and master cooks JJ and Cousin Mark retired, and retired the name with them. Then JJ, aka Keke Kanaka Kapakahi o Kaliponi, passed on to that great lu'ah in the sky. Sunday, the station is reviving the event, renamed the Aloha Barbeque and Slack Key Festival. Now held at Beginnings in Briceland, it will feature Aaron Mahi, Martin Pahinui and George Kuo, the same Hawaiian slack key players as last year. <P>

Got a note from Celtophile George Z. re: another Beginnings event, an Irish concert on Thursday, Sept. 4, featuring One for the Road, "a new band made up of some of the best young players, two from the states, Dave Cory from Portland and Kira Ott from SoCal, and two from Ireland, Pat Egan and Mick Walsh."<P>

Same Thursday, CenterArts takes to the Plaza with a show at Mazzotti's featuring Austin's wild and crazy Americana/jug band assault team Asylum Street Spankers. Since pregnancy is in the news of late, we'll note that lead singer Christina Marrs is expecting her third child and will begin maternity leave as soon as the Spankers return to Texas. 
<P>
Things have slowed at the Lil' Red Lion after a wild summer with tons of shows (and not enough patrons). I haven't heard who is coming of late, but James Harkins, formerly of The Invasions dropped by with a flyer. He's debuting his solo act, James and the Junk Set, Friday at the Lion, playing guitar and a makeshift drum-kit. "Seriously everything came out of the junkyard or the recycling center," he tells me, adding, "I'm playing all the songs my bandmates wouldn't let me play because they weren't punk enough." Joining him, John Ludington, whose set at the Humboldt Folklife Fest's songwriter night totally impressed me, and new-in-town songwriter Steven Lee Wood.
<P>
You might also see James at the Eureka Theater earlier that night. The WildRiver101 Film Festival kicks of a "Friday Fright Fest" with Jon "Akira" Olsen's Zombies of Eureka assemblage with walking dead vids featuring The Invasions, The Buffy Swayze, The Ian Fays, The Monster Women, Dynamite Sweater, The Ravens, The Professional Superheroes and Von Richter. (I'm in it too.)

Bad Kitty Norm describes it as, "sort of a homecoming. Lightnin' Bill Woodcock was born in Eureka but left here as a toddler. The Lightnin' Woodcock Trio is a tongue-in-cheek mix of blues and punk rock." and they're playing Monday at The Pearl, if you're into that sort of thing.

I don't know much about McCaslin aside from the fact that he's been playing tenor sax since he was a teen and he's a Berklee alum  but the RJA folks have not hit a sour note yet, so I trust that he's the real deal. 
<P>
We told you about it months ago: iconic southern blues-rock band The Black Crowes and alt. psyche ex-locals Howlin Rain are playing the Van Duzer Wednesday, Sept. 10. There are plenty of tickets left in the balcony. Want seats on the floor? I can steer you to some online, $566 apiece, $1,132 for the pair. That's how good this show will be.

As any musicologist will tell you, the blues comes from Africa. Nowhere is this more evident than in the bluesy music that comes out of Mali, particularly as played by the late great guitarist Ali Farka Touré, whose sound was famously described by Martin Scorsese as "the DNA of the blues." Before he died in 2006, Ali made one last recording, contributing to the debut album by his son, Vieux Farka Touré, a youngster whose name translates as "old." While he took the torch from his father, Vieux is using it to light his own way. His eponymous Afro-blues album was followed this year by Vieux Remixed: UFOs Bamako with Cheb I Sabbah, Karsh Kale and Nickodemus among those handling remix chores.  <P>

Music is personal expression, says Vieux. Everyone has their own ideas and their way of doing things. No one can replicate what someone else has done. I am working to follow my fathers path, but that path continues into new areas. I am of a new generation, so there are things that inspire me in todays world that I put in my music, just as he did in his time.<P>

Vieux spent the summer touring the U.S. including a series of shows where he was part of a James Brown tribute show with J.B. alums Pee Wee Ellis and Fred Wesley joined by Cheikh Lô and others. Now Vieux is working with a five-piece band that mixes African and American musicians and styles. They hit Arcata Tuesday, Sept. 16, for a show at the Van Duzer Theatre.<P>

Arcata Playhouse proprietors Jacqueline "Jackie" Dandeneau and David "Guapo" Ferney are so talented and nice that you almost forget they're Canadian (just kidding). They've booked a phenomenal collection of cool shows to their space in the old Creamery, turning it into a major cultural resource. Friday, Sept. 12, they bring in a bunch of friends for another edition of Clüb Shampoo; this one subtitled "Teased Up." The show, hosted by David and Jackie, is a review featuring a who's-who of local talent: Tim Gray, Marla Joy, Mike LaBolle and Tim Randles make up an ad hoc house band called The Frosted Tips. (The event p.r. was littered with further hairdresser references, but we'll forego them here.) Then there's Lila Nelson and Jaese Jecuyer, both of whom shined in Dell'Arte's Korbel IV, Tyler Olsen (Korbel IV's co-director), Jeff DeMark, Julie and Curtis from Kulica, dancing by Shoshanna, music and dancing by Yo Tango, plus "surprises" untold. J&D note, "Walk-ins are welcome but reservations are recommended." (The show sold out last time.)<P>

The Playhouse comes alive again Monday, Sept. 15, with ace guitarist/songwriter/storyteller Willy Porter. I caught a set by Willie years ago when he was on the road with Joan Baez  he was really good. More recently he drew raves at one of the Lost Coast Live shows at Ferndale Rep, a cool series, although I never did understand why they kept the performers' identities secret. Willie is touring with Raining Jane, an all-female folk-rock quartet from L.A. who have been up here a couple of times with their friend Sara Bareilles, an ex-local who has been doing pretty well for herself this year. Sara is currently down-under in Australia; next stop Europe. Maybe she'll cross paths with local floorcore stars Starving Weirdos who just took off for a three-week Euro-tour: a week on the British Isles (including a gig at London's Millennium Dome) then over to the Netherlands for the ZXZW indie culture festival and on to Amsterdam and Brussels.  <P>

Saturday morning might be pretty crazy on the Arcata Plaza with the city's 150th anniversary party in the midst of the Farmers' Market, Magnolia swinging for shoppers and historic displays on the 8th St. side. Mazzotti's plays host to the annual KHSU Music Sale that morning starting at 10 a.m. Expect to find treasures buried amidst box after box of CDs albums by bands you've never heard of. Friday Jamdown host DJ Dub Cowboy will be in the house, mashing up music in many stylees. And yes, there will be vinyl for all you cratediggers.<P>

San Fran's Mon Cousin Belge offer what they describe as "deep faggotry jams" at Aunty Mo's Saturday with Arrogant Hare opening. Meanwhile honky tonk garage rockers Side Iron headline a show at the Alibi with Portland's Thee Headliners opening. Side Iron includes Keil, ex-Que La and Greg, ex-The Hitch, which reminds me: Last week, I incorrectly identified Jeff, formerly of The Hitch as part of Machete. He was hanging with Machete man Roshawn, also formerly of The Hitch, but Jeff is in The Fire Demons. All of this sort of confusion may be cleared up if the new blog, HumboldtBandsFamilyTree.wordpress.com takes root. Ross from The Delta Nationals is supposed to be helping me with it, but we've both been kinda busy. BTW, The Nats play Saturday with The Bucky Walters at the Arcata Community Center for Arcata 150th Anniversary bash. Should be fun.  
<P>
Don't forget The Neville Brothers are at the Arkley Center next Thursday, Sept. 18. More on that next week.

It's EarthDance weekend at Black Oak Ranch down in Laytonville. The annual "celebration for world peace and unity" gets underway Friday with Neko Case and Kinky among that day's headliners. Saturday's show includes Digable Planets and Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk and many, many others, plus the Prayer for Peace ritual. This year they're also offering Sunday-only tickets and it's a good day with swamp-funksters JJ Grey and Mofro (who play next Thursday at Humboldt Brews), reggae star Anthony B, young Afro-hip hopper K'Naan and Michael Franti and Spearhead all on the main stage. Also playing Sunday, Panjea, an awesome Afro-fusion band led by former local Chris "Toosa" Berry on mbira, and, of late, with ex-String Cheese fiddler Michael Kang.

Did you notice the date on this week's paper? That's right, it's Sept. 11, aka 9/11, another one of those dark days that will live in infamy.  The Accident Gallery and the poetry collective A Reason to Listen (Therese Keslin, Vanessa Pike, Nicola Hunt and Brad Wilson) are marking the date with a politically-themed poet's open mike with prizes. Meanwhile at HSU, songwriter Jesse Goplen plays for a 9/11 Truth HSU event that also includes a new 9/11 documentary Fabled Enemies. Jesse will debut songs from his upcoming EP, Cowboy, some of them love songs, some with a political 9/11 theme like his last album, September Eleven Blues. 
<P>
Jesse brought a burn of the new disc by my house last week and showed me his new guitar, a Gibson Custom Shop Super Jumbo Elite Custom, bought with part of a $25,000 sweepstakes prize he won after spending weeks entering every contest he could find online. He played me a tune off the album, a beautiful bluesy thing in a minor key called "Highway 101," written for Kyana, the love of his life. After he left, I spun the disc, and heard songs like "Didn't You Know?" where he asks us to listen to Willie Nelson's take on the 9/11 story. It made me wonder, why dwell on darkness when there's a bright future ahead, one that could be made even brighter by that big beautiful guitar.

It is not only Eek-A-Mouse's 6 feet 6 inches height that make him one of Jamaica's most individual talents. He has created a style all his own, and gone on to become something of an international phenomenon quite apart from the rest of the world of reggae. Hylton's unusual name was originally that of a racehorse upon which he frequently lost money; when the horse finally won a race, he had, of course, refused to back it. "My Father's Land" and "Creation", his first two releases, came out under his real name in the mid-70s. Not only were they made while he was still in college, they were produced by his math teacher Mr. Dehaney. In 1980, he started recording with Joe Gibbs after working briefly with the Papa Roots, Black Ark, Gemini, Jah Life, Black Scorpio and Virgo sound systems. "Wah Do Dem" was the 1980 single that made his name in Jamaica. Even though it was considered too controversial for radio airplay. It was followed by "Modelling Queen," another JA hit single that appeared on his first album "Bubble Up Yu Hip". Both were produced by singer Linval Thompson and issued on his Thompson Sound label in Jamaica. By 1981, he had teamed up with producer and Volcano sound owner Henry "Junjo" Lawes and had achieved significant hits with "Once A Virgin", "Modelling Queen" and "Virgin Girl". Before the year was out, the artist had joined forces with producer Junjo Lawes and remixer Scientist. Backed by the Roots Radics, Eek cut "Virgin Girl" and "Noah's Ark," before having another go at "Wa-Do-Dem," for Greensleeves. The latter did the trick and Eek-A-Mouse had arrived with a sound so unlike any other, equal parts singing, DJing, and disconcerting Oriental-esque weirdness, that soon all of the island was raving about the rodent. He was the toast of Reggae Sunsplash in 1981, his bubbling lunacy providing a cathartic release to a festival otherwise in mourning for Bob Marley. "Biddy biddy beng" roiled out across the crowd, and the audience shouted it back as one, instantly cementing the syllables as the catchprase of the new decade.
<p>
A chat with Eek-A-Mouse is something of an aural adventure. More than a quarter-century of recording, global touring and enough years of residency in the suburbs of Irvine to justify an accent heavy on California mall girl-isms have hardly changed the dancehall godfather's husky Kingston patois. Though his voice is smooth and rich in tone, Mouse's unique re-imagining of English grammatical rules can prove challenging to the unprepared ear. Take a conversation touching on Mouse's feelings about his music's place among reggae's current crop of dancehall favorites. While a couple of decades removed from the early '80s Jamaican dancehall scene that solidified his reputation as one of the genre's most irreverent and oft-copied toasters, The Mouse  as he is fond of calling himself  hardly feels his career has peaked or that his time has passed. "I'm Mouse, you know? I'm Mouse, so I can change my style any time. There's different reggae now ... hip-hop, dance, regular reggae. Just like Eek-A-Mouse. I'm also unique, you know? Different." "I was singing when I was a child, yeah," said Mouse, asked about his hand-to-mouth beginnings in Kingston's notorious Trench Town ghetto. "I would sing with my mama. I was singing all the while. Then the kids got interested, and sometimes I would sing them songs. Sometimes there would be little concerts going on in school and I would participate in singing, you know? But I knew I was gonna be a singer soon." Mouse's diverse list of early musical influences reads like a Magic 8-Ball of the varied styles that would eventually color his inventive lyricism and instrumentation. "I loved Nat King Cole, Marty Robbins, Cab Calloway, Patsy Cline ... all different singers. Sam Cooke and The Beatles ... and stuff like that," said Mouse, rhapsodically. "And then I came up with my own original style." That "original style" included elements of "sing-jaying," an early form of toasting (boastful catch phrases, singing and DJ work) mixed with funky vocal gymnastics and effects. Mouse's contribution to the genre was a percussive, nasally vocal style, and a talent for using his voice as a musical instrument that moved The Boston Globe to call him "the Al Jarreau of reggae." Much to his chagrin, Mouse has also often been called the originator of "sing-jaying." "I don't know why they call me that," said Mouse, chuckling. "Maybe ... it's a good vibe. Maybe a good vibe is what they feel, you know? Using my voice as an instrument ... (it's) just what I do, you know? "Sometimes, if I'm freestyling lyrics ... I'm thinking about the sound. I say, 'bam-ding-ding' and stuff like that to get the lyrics together."
<p>
Over the years, Mouse's core audience has also happily accepted his frequent lyrical switch-ups from half-baked humor ("The Mouse and The Man" is about a Disney World meeting of the minds with Mickey) and pointed social commentary ("Operation Eradication" is about the murder of his friend Errol Scorcher by politically-motivated Jamaican eradication squads). "That just came natural," said Mouse, of not being pigeon-holed to a sole lyrical style. "I never worried about ... sounding the same because I'm always seeing stuff happen to people. And I'm alive, you know? So I just sing about current stuff happening in the world ... and just make it unique to The Mouse." And as evidenced by some off-the-cuff long-distance crooning, what seemed to be on The Mouse's mind of late was some serious fascination with amour. "I've got a song called 'Pretty Girl,'" said Mouse, offering a track from this summer's still untitled followup CD to 2001's "Eeksperience." He began singing softly and sweetly, "She's a pretty girl. Pretty like a diamond. Pretty like a-gold." After finishing, Mouse shared a few verses from another gently performed love song called "I'll Be Waiting," this one using all manner of weather-related lyrical metaphors as a promise of keeping one's love real. You in love, Mouse? "Yeah, you know ... but not really," he said, laughing again. "I go through stuff sometimes, you know?  and I'll sing about it. It's like stress release." We know.

Melvin Seals has established a reputation as a recording artist, producer and record company executive in the field of gospel music. He first took up piano at the age of 8 and his first public performances were playing gospel music in church; his first band, "Gideon & Power," was a local San Fransicso group. He has gone on to perform/record with Elvin Bishop, Charlie Daniels, Chuck Berry-and for 15 years with Jerry Garcia. He was the featured organist in such broadway hits as "Evolution of the Blues" with John Hendricks, ACT's production of "American More Or Less," the Joyce Carroll Thomas play "A Song In the Sky," and the hit "Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope". 
<P>
Melvin formed JGB one year after Jerry Garcia's death on August 8, 1995 and was originally joined by Gloria Jones and Jackie Labranch, who had been Garcia's background singers. He toured steadily from late 1996 through 1997 and then released a live CD with JGB, "Welcome To Our World," in February of 1998. Continuing a tradition of great song writing, Melvin Seals & JGB keep the music alive performing across the country to fans of all ages.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Taj Mahal on food and music, plus clean-cut folk and a couple of new CDs
 <P>

Natch'l bluesman Taj Mahal released his first album in 1968, which means, as of this year, he's been in the blues business for 40 years. 
"I've outlived the former music business," he told me when I asked what had changed for him over that time. "I started out playing music that I liked, music I thought needed to be heard, that needed to have someone play it. Young African Americans of my generation needed to be responding to the traditional music that had been passed to them. Somehow or other is had been passing people by. A bunch of other folks picked up on the music and did real well with it. I didn't see that I should be left out, especially when it comes to my culture. I wasn't mad at nobody, because I don't talk that way  I just put my energy out there. If you want things to change you gotta do something about it. So, that's what I've been doing, doing something about it ever since." 
When he said "other folks" picked up on the blues, he basically meant young whites were embracing the blues, in part via British blues players. I wondered, wasn't the blues pretty much considered old folks music in the black community? The question struck a chord.<P>

"That was the urban audience. They saw themselves as being connected to what was new and what was more hip. If you were country, there was something wrong with you. OK. Now Mr. Urban Know-It-All, whoever you are, eating food that's being genetically altered by Archer-Daniels-Midland, poisoned by Dow Chemical insecticides and Monsanto fertilizer, you tell me what was wrong with being country and knowing how to handle your food? Now we're all in the same boat and you're better off if you have that knowledge.
"My interests as a youngster were two: music and agriculture. I figured there was no way a culture was going to get away without those things. So I learned about the older style of agriculture. It doesn't change. I don't buy the modern way that says I'll just walk in my kitchen and be totally serviced and I'll be fed and washed and put out the door and I'll never have to lift a finger. What kind of foolishness is that? There are people who want that, but I think that's the reason we have the drain on our resources we have today. Everybody's waiting for someone else to do it, for someone else to carry the load. The guys at the top figure the consumer will be the one to pay for it, all of it. And look where that brought us. <P>

But for me, music has been the highway to stick to. When I connect with the music of my people in Africa, we're talking about 149 generations. It's not, 'I didn't get a hit so I quit and drove tractor for awhile, then they convinced me to come back and now I've got a big hit and everything's great.' No, this is a real serious commitment, man. It's like what are you doing here on this planet? <P>

"What makes me able to do what I'm doing is, I know when I wake up in the morning and think about the music, or music comes to visit me in my sleep, I know I'm on the right path. And I'm lucky because I get to do what I love. That's what this 40th is all about, to say, 'Here I am, and thank you guys for supporting me all these years. And I'm still here, still lovin' it, just like I was in the beginning.'"<P>


Feeling natural? The Taj Mahal Trio plays Saturday night at the Van Duzer. 
<P>

It's hootenanny time Saturday at the Arkley Center with a flashback to the folk revival featuring The Kingston Trio and The Brothers Four, two combos that had smash hits back in the '50s and early '60s with their clean-cut take on folk. Formed in 1957 in Palo Alto, The Kingston Trio made their name with an extended gig at San Francisco's hungry i and a surprise hit version of the murder ballad "Tom Dooley," and a series of very successful albums. The original trio lasted 10 years, disbanding in the Summer of Love. One member, Bob Shane wanted to keep things going and bought the name from the others. Until he retired in '05, Shane worked with a rotating group of singers included former members of The Limeliters and The Brothers Four. The Brothers Four were frat brothers at U. Wash in Seattle when they got going in 1958 (which means they're celebrating their golden anniversary). They followed a trajectory similar to the K. Trio, moving to S.F. and scoring pop hits with "Greenfields" and "Green Leaves of Summer." Only Bob Flick remains from the original line-up; Mark Pearson has been a Bro off and on since 1968. 
<P>

Meanwhile across town at the Eureka Theater, it's a flashback of a different sort as San Fran-based House of Floyd offers a tribute to the psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd. Expect a Floyd-esque show with lights, lasers and theatrics. Like Deadheads, they're devotees who say, "For each of us, Floyd has simply become an all-encompassing obsession about life, death and everything in between."
<P>

And out in Blue Lake Saturday we have another tribute: Garratt Wilkin and The Parrotheads present "A Celebration of Jimmy Buffett's Music." I'm guessing margaritas will be the drink du jour.<P>


Ready for one more? Tuesday, Sept 30, the Red Fox presents Phish Pharm, who "celebrate of the music by Phish," with "mad light show!"

The Bucky Walters play "bluegrass and beyond" Saturday as part of the Mateel's massive Humboldt Hoedown down at SoHum Community Park (see calendar for full details), but first, on Friday, the band celebrates completion of a new CD, Phone, at Mosgo's. Of course the Phone of the title is one of those old timey models, not cellular or Bluetooth. Berel Alexander opens the Mosgo's show. <P>


Mosgo's is CD release central this weekend: Saturday, ex-local Casio cuties The Ian Fays are up from Frisco for an all-ages CD release party for their latest, Dylan's Lost Days. The Fays also play Friday at the Lil' Red Lion; both local shows pair them with their friends Hey Eleanor. Incidentally, if it's like the twins' other albums, the Dylan of the title is probably not Bob, but some ex-boyfriend.

San Francisco's BLVD is another of those electro-jam outfits applying elements from electronica like looping and sampling to live jams, and in this case incorporating hip hop elements via MC Souleye, a self-described "conscious wordsmith" out of Colorado. They're at the Red Fox Friday with San Diego funk combo On The One.
<P>

Classical fans have a choice to make Friday: The new season of the Eureka Chamber Music Series at Calvary Lutheran begins that night with pianist Anton Nel playing Beethoven. Over at Fulkerson Hall, it's "Fascinating Rhythms" with soprano Elisabeth Harrington, clarinetist Virginia Ryder and pianists Deborah Clasquin, Ching-Ming Cheng and John Chernoff (HSU music faculty all) performing jazz-inspired classics. The show's name comes from one piece that Clasquin will play, part of a collection of etudes by Earl Wild based on Gershwin tunes.

Humboldt Baykeeper celebrates another birthday Friday with a bash at the Arcata Community Center. Dinner from Hurricane Kates, speeches, awards and the requisite auction are followed by vibrant music by The West African Highlife Band, an all-star ensemble from the Bay Area. Leader Ken Okulolo came to the U.S. from Nigeria with King Sunny Ade and later formed Kotoja. Guitarist Soji Odukogbe, also from Nigeria, played for years with the late great Fela Kuti. Percussionist Nii Armah Hammond, from Ghana, was a founding member of Hedzoleh Soundz. Is this sounding familiar? The same band played for the same event last year. And same as last year, you're welcome to skip dinner and just come to dance.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Brightblack Morning Light and Avocet, plus a WoMama party and other worldly music

 <P>

Their record company, Matador, refers to them as a "nomadic duo," and notes that Nathan "Naybob" Shineywater and Rachael Hughes, aka Brightblack Morning Light, are "currently living in rural New Mexico" (judging from the photo supplied, somewhere out in the desert). More immediately, Brightblack is in greener climes, on their way south out of Oregon on "The Crystal Totem Turr." They'll be in Arcata Friday for a show at Humboldt Brews. <P>

HumBrews is the first place I heard Nathan and Rachel play: Five or six years back I went there to see neo-folk icon Bonnie Prince Billy, aka Will Oldham, and was drawn in by the opening act, Rainywood, an earlier incarnation of Brightblack that was exploring a sort of dub-folk sound that would evolve into the languorous reverb-soaked bright-black space-funk-gospel of today. The Rainywood EP I bought that night included a song called "River Day" about following a sparrow to take off for "a rainbow river day" enjoying the sun and rain and the colors they make together. I talked with Nathan about the song a couple of years ago when BBML was here for a fall music fest at HSU  I ran into them on the Plaza at the Farmers' Market the next morning. He told me "River Day" dated back to his days living in Arcata. At the time he was working packing toys for the Michael Olaf Montessori Company and busking with his guitar, usually by the Minor Theater. He made friends with some of the street people, including one particular old hippie (whose name escapes me) who encouraged his tendency to cut out from work and escape out 299 for river days. That same sort of feeling of escape from care carries through to the music he's making now. 
<P>
A couple of weeks ago Matador released Motion To Rejoin, a follow-up to the eponymous Brightblack Morning Light album of 2006. The band describes Motion... as "anti corporate, anti nuclear, anti coal," noting that it was recorded with four solar panels. Again, the dreamy music is made on processed slip-sliding guitar and vintage keyboards with occasional horn interludes and laid-back percussion. I can't really tell you exactly what songs like "Hologram Buffalo," "Past a Weatherbeaten Fencepost" or " When Beads Spell Power Leaf" are about  when there are vocals, they act more as mystic incantations than as songs in the traditional sense. All I know is, they evoke a cool, supremely relaxed feeling, and I like them  a lot. 
<P>
Joining Brightblack on the Crystal Totem Turr is Avocet, aka Meara O'Reilly, formerly of a band called Feathers. She tells me, "I'll be playing songs on guitar and with an instrument that I built out of amplified silverware and horsehair, as well as singing through home-made plate reverb. My songs are often written based on the resonances of objects." Since Brighblack's music is all about resonance, I'm sure she fits right in.
<P>
Elsewhere in Arcata that night (Friday, Oct. 10) my favorite "Afrock" band WoMama marks the official release of their CD, Foté Faré with a party at Redwood Raks, the dance studio in the old Arcata Creamery. Naturally, they're including dancers: Shoshanna's Ya Habibi Belly Dancers (Redwood Raks resident troupe) and next door neighbors from New World Ballet, plus the WoMama affiliated Brazilian-style drum and dance troupe Quente sambAmore and the also-affiliated a cappela group AkaBella. Sounds like quite a party.
<P>
A couple of notes came in this week re: a Friday show at the Jambalaya. Robert Tripp wanted to let me know about his blues-rock band, The Hard Ride, formerly known as High Grade. After finding drummer Tavan Anderson (ex-Nuns with Guns) via Humboldtmusic.com earlier this year, the band played a few shows with rotating bassists before taking a break to "work on new ideas that were harder, faster and dirtier." A couple of personnel changes later Jody Goldman from Dragged By Horses signed on as bassist (a good sign). "We played our first gig last weekend at Bikes by the Bay and things are sounding better than ever," says Tripp, adding, "This Friday we're playing at Jambalaya with two touring bands. Then on Saturday, we'll be at the Lil' Red Lion with my friends Ol' Scratch who are on tour from Virginia. These guys play doom metal through a giant wall of Sunn O)))) amps and cabinets. Come on out and witness some great guitar rock!"
<P>
The second note came from my friend Coleman, an ex-local who now lives in Washington and plays with the folk-punk trio Ask Sophie. Coleman is also in Rumplesnakeskin, a three-piece power trio that was supposed to play at the Jam with The Hard Ride. "Well," says Coleman, "things don't always turn out the way you want when you are dealing with creative, march-to-a-different-drummer types, and Rumplesnakeskin's singer/guitarist bagged out on the gig. Fortunately, 2/3rds of Rumplesnakeskin is also in Ask Sophie, and we're playing a private function in Humboldt, so we recruited Brett "the Truck" Shuler to replace our singer and will play as Ask the Truck at the Jam. Hope to see you there."
<P>
Same night, over at Mazzotti's, organ/keys jam-master Melvin Seals begins a two-night run with JGB, the remnants of the Jerry Garcia Band. Friday is also Arts! Arcata night, which means music and art all around town. Photographer Chris Tuite combines music and art with this show of concert photos at Arcata Photo Studios (in the Jacoby Storehouse) including pics from local shows and stuff shot this summer in NYC during his internship with Rolling Stone.
<P>
Wait, there's more: The Gyan Riley Trio plays Friday at HSU's Fulkerson Hall. The son of minimalist music legend Terry Riley (and a former HSU music teacher) guitarist Gyan Riley mixes classical and jazz styles adding East European, Indian and African elements. One of my favorite jazz drummers, Scott Amendola, is on Gyan's latest album, Melismantra, and he'll be up for Friday's gig playing tunes from the CD along with violinist/violist Timb Harris. Weve also opened up certain sections for improvisational solos to allow for unexpected twists and turns," says Riley.
<P>
The Red Fox continues it's role as reggae-central: Friday they have niceness by Pato Banton (backed by Mystic Roots), Saturday it's Bob's son, Ky-Mani Marley, then on Wednesday, Oct. 15, it's former Black Uhuru vocalist Junior Reid and The One Blood Band. Irie!
<P>
The raw food restaurant Green Life Evolution Center is moving into the old Greenhouse Boardshop in Arcata and, as they did when they were out in Blue Lake, they'll have music on occasion. Saturday, Oct. 11, they ease into the new space with a show featuring the amazing kora player Youssoupha Sidibe, who blew many minds at this summer's Reggae Rising.   
<P>
Up at Fulkerson Hall Saturday, pianist Deborah Clasquin plays 20th century music from all over including tunes by Ravel, Bartok, jazz piano great Bill Evans and lesser known composers Frederico Mompou and Karol Szymanowski.
<P>
Kabile Traditional Wedding Band has been playing traditional Bulgarian village music on traditional village instruments for 30 years, which, according to the Humboldt folkdancers bringing them to town, makes for  "an acoustic experience quite different from [music] played on Western instruments influenced by American jazz." So, the Kabile show Sunday evening at Unitarian Fellowship Hall in Bayside should be totally worldly.

This week Arcata based producer Jan van Lier releases his 3rd EP on Definitive Recordings, "Rishada". The EP contains 3 tracks from Jan, two which were huge summer anthems for Carl Cox this year, plus a remix from good friends and excellent American producers, Taurus and Vaggeli.<p>

The title cut "Rishada" was included by Carl Cox on his "Space Ibiza 2008 CD", and "Si Es Bueno" was charted by him on his top 10 for Resident Advisor, Raveline, Carlcox.com, and other prominent websites and magazines. "Manni Ruman" is a bouncy electro-tech-house jacker that is sure to conjure up fond memories of the old warehouse days. Remix duties on "Manni Ruman" are served up by Taurus and Vaggeli, who provide a more uplifting electro house vibe to balance out the EP. Taurus and Vaggeli have recently remixed David Vendetta, and have releases on Bug Eyed, Teggno, Vacation Records, and Donald Glaude Records (DGR).

David Brogan of ALO specializes in variety, eclecticism and groove. The music he creates encompasses everything from poppy jam-rock, straight ahead funk to synth drone ensembles. Brogan started learning both piano and percussion at the age of seven. His piano studies took him in the direction of music theory, songwriting and composition, and drum studies at UCSB, where he hooked up with the west-coast jam outfit ALO- pulling triple duty as drummer, songwriter and occasional lead singer. He has recorded two albums with the band, Fly Between Falls, and Roses and Clover, both for Brushfire Records / Universal.
<P>
In January of 2008 Brogan headed into the studio to record material he'd been developing over the last few years. Tim Bluhm, lead singer and guitarist of California cult band The Mother Hips, produced and appeared on the record. Ranging from atmospheric acoustic folk to pseudo arena-rock anthems, the songs on the album reflect Brogan's continued dedication to the eclectic. He also plays most of the instruments on the album, which features guest artists Jackie Greene, Paul Hoaglin, Tim Young, bandmate Dan Lebowitz and others. The album, titled Thunderbird / Sun Transformation, is slated for release in mid-October of 2008.

HEAVYWEIGHT DUB CHAMPION        

<p>
Created in the mountains of Colorado in 1997, Heavyweight Dub Champion is a musical entity here to reclaim sacred space through ritualistic performance and sonic alchemy. HDC communes with Warrior Spirits in the creation, production and performance of their vibrational healing aural mandalas. Their debut album, "Survival Guide For the End of Time" won numerous awards in the State of Colorado, including Westword Magazine's Colorado Album of the Year. Their upcoming release features multiple tracks with KRS ONE, Killah Priest, Dr. Israel, Apostle, Stero Lion, Elf Tranzporter, Wailer B, Lady K, and others. All music falls under a specific credo described in the Last Champion Manifesto, included in "Survival Guide." The mission of Heavyweight Dub Champion and Champion Nation is the Unconditional Liberation of the Human Race. All music is created from scratch by the sonic shamanistic alchemists: Resurrector, Patch, and Totter Todd. "Survival Guide" features scratching by DJ Hot Daddi 36-O and their as of yet untitled follow-up album features scratching by DJ Illnaughty. 
<p>
DR. ISRAEL   <p>
Lead by Brooklyn's own Dr. Israel, this new incarnation of the Dub sound is like nothing else you've heard. "Patterns of War," the new album by Doc and the young Brooklyn collective Dreadtone International, is a new-school-meets-old-school marriage of roots, dub, trip-hop, rock, and R&B. Teaming up with vocalists Lady K and Chemda, along with an assortment of Brooklyn's finest dub players, the good Dr. has created possibly his most accessible effort to datean entirely new dub sound. Think Massive Attack vs. Fugees. Heavy heavy bass lines, thundering beats, beautiful melodies, pristinely produced vocals, and conscious lyrics paint an over-all soundscape which is as powerful as it is unique.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Barry Melton talks politics, plus Ronstadt con Mariachi and a big jar of jam<p>

Back in 1965, when musicians in San Francisco were just starting to invent psychedelic rock, across the Bay in Berkeley, an equally psychedelic folk/rock band called Country Joe and The Fish, formed, initially to serve as opening act at a campus performance by The Fugs and the poet Allen Ginsburg. In the beginning the band was Joe McDonald, and guitarist Barry "The Fish" Melton. Berkeley was a political place at the time, revolution was in the air, and The Fish was a political band. With some added members, the band went on to iconic status playing the Avalon and the Fillmore and famously (since it's recorded on film) at Woodstock. <p>

Forty-some-odd years later, Melton is working as a Yolo County public defender, but he still plays music, and will do so Saturday at that home of classic rock, the Riverwood Inn. Since politics is once again in the air, I asked Barry about the intersection of rock and politics. 
<p>
He replied, "Rock 'n' roll has a significant part of its heritage wrapped up in the vast span of American music: blues, country, folk, jazz and popular music. All of those idioms have, at times, political content interwoven into them. For the most part, and under ordinary circumstances, politics doesn't fit into our lives all that much, but given a significant turn of events (like hard times), whatever is going on eventually becomes a part of all art forms. Not to be intentionally trivial, but it was Bertolt Brecht who said, 'The job of an artist is to reflect his times.'"
<p>
The ad hoc band Melton is bringing along in made up of old friends with their own individual histories: multi-instrumentalist Lowell "Banana" Levinger was in The Youngbloods, drummer Roy Blumenfeld (who was just here with Nick Gravenites) was in The Blues Project and Seatrain, bass player Steve Ashman founded and the Zazu Pitts Memorial Orchestra. 
<p>
What should you expect from this quartet? "I've been playing with Peter on and off for over 40 years," said Melton, "and I've had the privilege of sharing the stage with both Banana and Roy through their various incarnations for most of my life. Now we're guys from the Sixties who are in our sixties.<p>

"My dear friend Spencer Dryden, who passed away a few years back, loved to gig on Saturday nights as the years went by. Spencer would say, 'Old musicians are fortunate  we're like a group of old guys who sit around and play poker; but when we get together to play, nobody has to be a loser we all have fun and we can take a bunch of people along with us.' I think the very special part of playing with Banana, Peter and Roy is that we're all around the same age, we understand each other musically, and we all still love to play. We can swap songs and improvise in an idiom that's easily accessible to each of us, and on a good night it can get kind of magical. It's a good life."
<p>
Linda Ronstadt stated cranking out hits in the '60s, when she sang with L.A. folk rock band The Stone Poneys, and continued through the '70s when she her folk pop excursions made her the best paid women in rock. She would later turn to jazz standards, hit Broadway, and in the '80s, embrace her Mexican-American roots. Border music is in her blood  she's originally from Arizona, from mixed Mexican-American/German/English heritage  and her current tour, which brings her to the Van Duzer Sunday, once again takes us south of the border as she reunites with Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano one of the bands that appeared on her 1987 album Canciones de Mi Padre.

Friday HumBrews has Miles Ahead, who are bidding goodbye to sax player Dan Pearson. Saturday it's jazz/funk from Seattle's Flowmotion with local funksters Moo-Got-2 opening. (BTW, they are the answer to last week's Magnum quiz.) Coming up Tuesday, Oct. 28, the return of Toubab Krewe, a truly fine band from Asheville, NC, who jam on traditional North African blues, transmuting it into something totally original and totally awesome. Bring merch money: pre-release copies of the Krewe's new album, Live at the Orange Peel, are available exclusively at their shows. For a preview tune in to KHUM that afternoon, they'll be in the studio with Mike Dronkers at 1 p.m.

Equally jameriffic: McTuff, a band started by Hammond organist Joe Doria, as an ode to soul jazz organ greats like Jack McDuff and Jimmy Smith that now includes the inimitable Skerik on sax. They're at the Red Fox Saturday. Coming up Monday Oct. 27, at the Fox, a special edition of the Acid Jazz Experiment (No. 26) to celebrate Brian Swizlo's birthday.

Don't know much about Tophs House, the new venue in Benbow, but I imagine it will be full of people Friday night when Bermudan dancehall star Colin Harper, aka Collie Buddz returns to SoHum with The New Kingston Band. Collie, who played this summer's Reggae Rising, is what you might call a sound-clash warrior. He explains, Back when Beenie and Bounty used to war lyrically, seeing clashes wit Kilimanjaro an all, the sound-man an everyting  the whole music scene for me took on a new meaning. Clash thing an lyrical war became a part of my daily life from early out. DJ Pee-Wee, Rise of the Revolution and DJ Selecta Prime open the show, which, being close to Halloween is a costume party. I don't know the size of Toph's, but I'd guess advance tickets are mandatory.

The band originally came out of the music program at Sonoma State University where Harrison Stafford taught a course, "History of Reggae Music." That was 10 years ago; the rootsmen have been around the world a cupla time since spreading the reggae vibe.<p>

The Arcata Interfaith Gospel Choir holds its annual Harvest Concert Saturday at the Arcata Presbyterian Church with a special guest set by the worldly a cappella group AkaBella. Note that this is the first Harvest show for new choir director Jaese Lecuyer who's been singing with the choir since 1995.<p>

Also in the vocal music vein, the annual Humboldt Harmonaires Beer and Peanuts Show, running two nights, first Friday at the Fortuna Riverlodge, then Saturday at the Arcata Community Center, with the Humboldt Harmonaires Barbershop Chorus, The Outstanding Bills Quartet, Mirth First Quartet and guests The Coastal Chords. You're also invited to sing-a-long with Fortuna accordion legend Lindy Mantova. <p>

On the classical front, the Eureka Chamber Music Series brings the Anglo/Irish ensemble Carducci String Quartet to Calvary Lutheran Friday for a program including works by Haydn, Schubert, Dvorak and Phillip Glass.<p>

That same night at HSU's Fulkerson Recital Hall, there's a show put together by local percussion guru Eugene Novotney and Marimba One featuring Polish marimba soloist Katarzyna Mycka playing music composed for the instrument by an international array of composers including Anna Ignatowicz from Poland. <p>

Folklifer Maia Cheli-Colando interviewed Katarzyna and asked if her music is distinctly Polish. "Yes," she replied, "I think there are some specific features that [differentiate] players from different continents, countries. Poland in this case is pretty specific: very patriotic, proud, but also kind of revolutionary. The geographical position of my country is possibly uncomfortable, between two big and strong nations, Russia and Germany, but we've never given up the independence.
<p>
"For marimba music with Polish feeling, I was looking for somebody who understands the sound and features of marimba, and I'm so happy to have found the person. Her name is Anna Ignatowicz and her compositions definitely sound 'Polish' and touch my national soul." (You'll find more of Maia's interview on the Journal Blogthing.)

GREENSKY BLUEGRASS TOURING IN SUPPORT OF THEIR RECENT RELEASE "FIVE INTERSTATES"
<p>
THE BAND FUSES TRADITION WITH AN ENHTUSIASM FOR IMPROVISATION
<p>

GREENSKY BLUEGRASS is one of the most exciting bands in today's music scene. Like a breath of fresh air, this five piece band plays traditional bluegrass instruments and uses them to create original songs and soundscapes that are unique and new, yet somehow feel comfortable and familiar. Though they have been likened to '70s era Americana acts like The Band, Greensky would prefer not to be compared to any other bands. "We really just try to make music as a group that sounds and feels right to us", says mandolin player Paul Hoffman, later adding that "it is nice to know that other people really dig it, too." 
<p>

"Greensky Bluegrass hits timeless targets with deadly accuracy while simultaneously veering off the tired and true highway."-Jambase.com

<p>
While "green sky" is the opposite of "blue grass", the band insists that the name came about as more of a pun than a statement about their music. "Along with the tradition of bluegrass, we all have lots of different musical influences that we bring to the table", says guitar player Dave Bruzza, "and we somehow wanted to reflect that in our name." Upon witnessing the band's live shows, this statement seems to make a little more sense. On any given night, in addition to the myriad of excellent original songs, one might hear traditional bluegrass songs with an exploratory rock and roll jam or selections from the Talking Heads, Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead or Bob Marley turned bluegrass. "We are as likely to play a three minute song as we are a ten minute song on any given night", says dobro player Anders Beck, "and I think that keeps it exciting for the audience". Perhaps this is the reason that Greensky Bluegrass is as equally embraced by the jam-band community as it is the bluegrass/Americana community and the band's fan base is growing so rapidly. <p>

"Of course, this is bluegrass. So manic chops mean a lot to Greensky Bluegrass. Yet they are also masterful storytellers. Mandolinist Paul Hoffman in particular pens some true rural balladry." -Seattle Weekly
<p>
Greensky Bluegrass is touring in support of their recently released fourth album, "Five Interstates", which was produced by Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth. The album, their strongest to date, features twelve original tracks and one traditional bluegrass song (a nod to the deceased King of Bluegrass, Jimmy Martin) ,and showcases the band's songwriting and playing talents in a way that is incredibly accessible to fans of many different types of music.  Carbone notes on the package: "Five Interstates came together like five lives intertwined, the intersection of a lifetime frozen in precious time and preserved in a digital tableau. I'm blessed&We're all blessed to be witness to a band ascending as true as an arrow shot to the sky."
<p>

Since winning the 2006 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest, Greensky has been touring constantly, playing over 170 shows a year, and all the hard work is certainly paying off. Recent highlights are too many to list, but include selling out venues in many parts of the country, sharing the stage with musical heroes, getting asked to play shows with the likes of  Tony Rice and Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Yonder Mountain String Band and Railroad Earth, and being asked to play the inaugural Rothbury Festival in their home state of Michigan. "It certainly felt like an affirmation that we are doing something right", noted bass player Mike Devol. <p>

Greensky Bluegrass is Anders Beck (dobro), Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), Mike Devol (upright bass) and Paul Hoffman (mandolin).

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Featuring Vince Herman of Leftover Salmon<p>
Wednesday, November 12th<p>
The Red Fox Tavern<p>
Eureka, CA<p>
Great American Taxi continues to break through the barriers of traditional music and forge a musical path that is distinctly their own.  With Leftover Salmons former front man Vince Herman steering the ride, Great American Taxi reaches beyond the realms of traditional Americana, Roots, Funk, Rock, and full flavored Country and has instead melded these into a sound aptly dubbed, Americana without Borders.<p>
Great American Taxi was originally formed when Vince Herman scrambled to put together a group of musicians for a post-Katrina benefit.  What transpired was the creation of a 7 piece band that gelled so quickly it was impossible to give up.  A few years later (and a couple members lighter), Great American Taxi has traveled across the country countless times picking up many fans for the ride, become a staple to the festival scene, and released a critically acclaimed debut album (Streets of Gold).  It appears, to the joy of their fans, that Taxi is here to stay.
While Great American Taxi has chosen to make their mark the old fashioned way, taking to the road and gaining fans one by one, their debut album, Streets of Gold, hit the shelves with a great response from fans and critics alike.  From the warm heart-felt lyrics of the title track, to the festival feel of Ride, down to the politically and environmentally charged Appalachian Soul, this album truly shows the range and appeal of Great American Taxi.  While relying on their talent in improvisation, it is truly their songwriting and the structure of their songs that makes them unique to the scene.<p>
On lead guitar, vocals, and various other instruments, Vince Herman (Leftover Salmon) drives this ride bringing along his now famous festival attitude for passengers to enjoy.  Keyboardist, Chad Staehly (John McKay Band) brings literate, melodic tunes in the vintage country rock tradition. With additional vocals and a powerful big-room feel provided by drummer Chris Sheldon and bassist Edwin Hurwitz, Great American Taxi has found a recipe that keeps fans traveling from city to city to see what they might come up with next.  Just catching the ride on a permanent basis is Jim Lewin on lead guitar and vocals. It is the blending of each band members style and experiences as well as a dedication to playing great new music that makes Great American Taxi a force to be reckoned with.
No other ensemble on the scene today floats so effortlessly along the roots-rock spectrum with such ground breaking original style or genuine love of music and the stage.  Through it all, they keep the audience dancing - and laughing - along.<p>

WARRIOR KING       http://www.myspace.com/warriork
<p>
"Like a bolt of lightening from the sky, Rasta messenger Warrior King has burst upon the scene, utilizing his gift of song to spread Jah truth throughout the land."

<p>

Warrior King was born on the 27th of July 1979, in Jubilee Hospital, soon moving to Clarendon, then settling in the growing city of Portmore at age eleven. "From birth I..ve always loved music, but it was not until I attended high school at the age of 13 that I thought about it as something I could do myself," Warrior King explains. "At this time I followed Bounty Killer..s style, but them my friend Warrior Mark, him said, "you have the potential. You have the talent." From there I started increasing my own thing, and with encouragement of my peers and inspiration and t..ing, the music started to flow." Like many successful Jamaican entertainers, Warrior King gained his earliest stage experience in talent shows. "I started out with school concerts at first, "He says. "At the time when I just came inna music, I used to do some combinations with a yout.. named likkle blacks, Marlon Stewart. We used to do Tastee..s Talent show together, so we could start getting exposed and gain experience." When he first started out Warrior King chatted in a hardcore deejay style, like his original hero, Bounty. A switch to the more holistic "singjay" sound came gradually. "It..s a natural thing what just grow inside of me, even his name is an extension of his evolution. "I changed my name from ..Junior King.. to ..Warrior King.. because it had more of spiritual feel to it. Fighting against oppression, fighting against wrong. I..m jah warrior, yuh know, fighting a warrior rootical love." In 2001, his single "Virtuous Women" graced the airwaves internationally and become number one throughout many countries. His debut album Virtuous Women was released shortly after which also featured a handful of top charting singles ("Breadth of Fresh Air", "Power to Chant"). Warrior King has been working hard in the studios with legendary producer Colin "Bulby" Yorke, and Sly and Robbie .His third album will be released in early 2008. He has been rehearsing tirelessly with his band as he gets ready to tour the world with his new album. Stay tuned for more info on cd release and tour dates. To all his fans Warrior King wants you to know that you will be seeing him soon.

"One never doubts the Hackensaw Boys are giving you everything they have in them. It's refreshing in a world of half measures and empty talk. They have their sights on the right things and it always comes through in their music." - Dennis Cook (Jambase)

<P>

The Hackensaw Boys first began playing their joyful blend of old-time tinged music on the streets of Charlottesville in the autumn of 1999. Far from limiting themselves to the old-time canon, however, the Hackensaws have been first and foremost a band of songwriters. Their music, while drawing upon the spirit of the mountains, is sophisticated and informed by the best elements of punk rock and classic country music. As one reviewer put it: Imagine the Carter Family meets the Ramones, and you begin to get the picture.<P>

You see them in the early hours of the morning walking hotel corridors, or boldly traversing rush hour streets. They are sincere, polite but talkative men with instrument cases. They admire the local scenery and appear unfed. By day they seem incapable of action but at night they step onto a stage and with taut fiddle bows, worn cutlery and dirty strings bring you a focused, vibrant and joyful sound. They are the Hackensaw Boys  and they are in your town.<P>

Proof of the Hackensaws' amazing versatility is evidenced by their awesome gig resume, which spikes crazily between opening slots for everyone from The Flaming Lips and Modest Mouse to The Detroit Cobras and De La Soul. They're also keen to collaborate, serving as the backing band for Country singing/songwriting Hall of Fame legend Charlie Louvin and collaborating with Cracker/Camper Van Beethoven mahouts Johnny Hickman and David Lowery (they've also rung in the new year with Del McCoury at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville). 
<P>
After seven years of relentless touring throughout the United States, Europe and the U.K., the Hackensaw Boys are being recognized as one of the most exciting groups on the diverse Americana music scene. The group's second release for Nettwerk Records "Look Out" represents the recorded culmination of the Hackensaw's unique vision: A celebratory but defiant sound culled from old-time mountains, backstage doorways and punishing drives through the evolving American landscape. Nine of the album's 12 songs were written from within the group and sometimes-Modest Mouse-sometimes-Hackensaw, Tom Peloso, contributed two tracks. A pounding rendition of the traditional "Gospel Plow" rounds out the package.<P>

The Hackensaw Boys have survived departures and arrivals, tribulations, blessings and, most importantly, each other. Add to this, thousands of nights in hundreds of clubs from Nashville to Bangor, from Los Angeles to Rotterdam and you begin to get an idea of the dedication and sheer mule-like tenacity that is the Hackensaw Boy ethic. So, whether you catch these guys on the road or pick them up in a store, be sure to check out the Hackensaw Boys  the perfect anodyne for the aches and pains of modern life.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Eight Days of Doom to Pass Through Eureka </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">In this darkening season of ghosts, witches, and celebrations of the dead, perhaps no show is more timely than the one slated for Wednesday, November 5th at Aunty Mos Lounge in Eureka when Humboldt Free Radio Alliance presents Corrupted, Asunder, and Amber Asylum. <P>

Corrupted hails from Japan and are visiting North American shores for the first time in over ten years. Their brand of sludgy and excruciatingly slow riffage, combined with the lowest of gut-wrenching death growls, is unique in a way that has made them appealing to both punk and metal audiences. Corrupteds legendary status within the world of doom metal is partially due to the bands somewhat reclusive nature and dedication to a do-it-yourself work ethic, one that lead to the bands decision to eschew involvement with large record labels and refusal to make themselves available to any kind of mainstream press. 
<P>
Oaklands Asunder is responsible for bringing Corrupted back to the United States for this much anticipated tour, which has been fittingly dubbed the Eight Days of Doom, and has in recent years established themselves as one of the most respected doom oriented bands in the metal underground. Their 2006 release Works Will Come Undone (Profound Lore Records) received wide recognition as a model of excellence within its genre.  Asunder is comprised of well-respected veterans of Californias underground music scene, including members from Dystopia, Weakling, and The Gault. <P>

While not heavy in same way as the bands that will follow, the dark ambient sounds of San Franciscos Amber Asylum will certainly set the mood for the evening. Their neoclassical approach is highlighted by the inclusion of violin and cello in their stormy and introspective work and has made them a West Coast favorite since the mid-90s. The bands main songwriter, Kris Force, has always attracted a variety of musicians into its ever-changing fold, most notably Steve Von Till of NeurosisHammers of Misfortune.<P>

Doors for this event will open at 9pm with music starting at 10pm sharp. Tickets are $10 and will be available at the door. This is a 21+ show.

<P>
It was way back in 1952 when mystic artist, experimental filmmaker, ethnomusicologist and record collector Harry Smith assembled The Anthology of American Folk Music, an annotated box set with selections from his vast collection of 78s in the blues, country, old timey and gospel vein. Smith's masterwork influenced musicians from Bob Dylan to the Grateful Dead, turning them on to tunes and styles most had never heard. The legacy of Smith and the artists he anthologized carries through to a new generation in the wide array of alt. roots music heard in nightclubs and cafes across the country  and here in Humboldt.
<P>
For example: Thursday, Nov. 20, at the Jambalaya, Portland's raw bucket 'n slide country blues boys Hillstomp share a bill with New Yorkers O'Death, a Goth country punk combo touring behind their new CD Broken Hymns, Limbs and Skin, which is quite good with raggedy old timey banjo and fiddles sharing space with guitars and drums on dark songs about life, love and yes, death. If Harry Smith was still around, this is the music he'd be into. 
<P>
The next night, Friday, Nov. 21, Ghostwriter plays Big Pete's Pizza. Ghostwriter is the nom-de-band for Austin musician Steve Schecter whose solo act finds him kicking out rhythms with a homemade foot-percussion device as he strums his hollow-body guitar and occasionally blows a harmonica on primal folk/punk blues.
<P>
My newest MySpace friend Lightnin' Bill Woodcock in back in town for a pair of shows. The Eureka native with amazing muttonchops plays a mix of classic blues and raunchy originals he calls "electrified psycho-delta blues/punk" on Thursday at the Pearl Lounge and Friday at the Jambalaya. Opening for both gigs, the local band, Blue Rhythm Review. "We're a soul band," says SoHum native James Moore, BRR drummer, "but we'll try to funk it up a bit for the crowd. What we try to do is get people up and dancing." The line-up: "We have Samantha Toste from Vintage Soul on vocals, Dan Perez from Arcata Music on guitar, Zach Stone on sax. Tim Day plays bass, he's in Vintage Soul too, but on drums."  <P>

Prog-rock guitar slinger Wolf Navarro has back-to-back gigs with his power trio Silent Giants. Thursday, Nov. 20, they're at Humboldt Brews with honky tonk heroes Rooster McClintock and self-described "melodic rock heart-throbs," The Common Vice. Friday the Giants hit the Red Fox with worldly "Afrock" band WoMama. 
<P>
Lots going down in the hip hop world: Thursday, Nov. 20, at Mazzotti's Bonus brings in Oakland rapper Keak Da Sneak, the guy who coined the term "hyphy." S.F.'s San Quinn will be along to "Shock the Party" along with Oaktown duo The Game Brothas.
<P>
Same Thursday at the Kate Buchanan Room, it's a benefit for the HSU Ski/Snowboard Club with local boys Subliminal Sabotage and Bay Area rap duo Caldecott Connection (named for the tunnel) plus "special guests." Showtime 9 p.m. <P>

Saturday at the Fox, That's How We Roll presents a hip hop blast featuring L.A. rhymer Abstract Rude along with DJ Drez and Myka 9 and the proverbial "special guests." Ab got his start working with Aceyalone at the seminal open mic scene at a vegetarian restaurant called The Good Life, which spawned Project Blowed. He later assembled Abstract Tribe Unique with a pair of dancers and DJ Drez on turntables, then Haiku D'Etat with Acey and Mykah 9. On a semi-related note, did y'all see in the Lumberjack about the new owner O-H's Townhouse? Gil Miracle of High Art is part of the local hip hop crew Opti-Pop. Apparently his plan is to turn the old school steak house into a nightclub called The Life. 
<P>
Sunday night at the Red Fox, T-S A&E dude Chris Durant throws a "Hip Hop Birthday Bash" with his crew, Republican Duck Hunters, plus Aquifer and The Joint Chiefs of Stash, who tell me they are "Del Norte County's premier freestyle rock band." Here's an idea for a b-day present for Durant: a new name for his band whose topical reference to the Cheney/Whittington quail hunting incident is now 2 1/2 years old. 
<P>
Got a note from NightHawk vocalist Marcia Mendels letting me know, "Clint Warner is going to join us for our gig this Friday at Bear River Casino. Ever since Clint filled in for Steve Delay last fall, we've wondered how much fun it would be to have both of these rocking guitarists on stage at the same time, and this Friday, we're going to find out!"
<P>
On the reggae front you have Jamaican veteran and dancehall pioneer Sugar Minott playing Friday at Humboldt Brews with support from semi-local Stevie Culture and Itawe. Saturday at Six Rivers Brewing it's Brit-born chanter Pato Banton, once again backed by The Mystic Roots Band.
<P>
Last time Saul Kaye was up here he was with his rock band. Lately he's been playing solo doing songs from his latest disc, Jewish Blues Vol. One. He explains, "You say Jewish blues and usually people laugh and say, what is that? The content is Jewish with songs written from he perspective of slaves in Egypt, and the Prophets and other characters from the Old Testament." Musically he draws from country blues and Chicago blues emulating guys like Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. Saturday Kaye hits a couple of brewpubs in Humboldt playing at 3:30 at Humboldt Brews, then from 7-9 at Six Rivers (before Pato). "Brews and blues is the theme of this tour," he notes.
<P>
Our favorite raconteur Jeff DeMark tells a few stories, old and new, at Muddy's Hot Cup Saturday backed by members from UKEsperience. He explains that the impetus for the ukulele back-up was a piece Jeff read a few years back at "In a Town This Size," a gathering of local literary legends held at CR. The story touched on that strange uke-wielding musician Tiny Tim. "This summer I read that story out at Dell'Arte with backing music by Curtis and Nick from Kulica. Jason from UKEsperience was watching the show. He liked it and wanted to work with me. It's taken a while to do it."<P>

With the Jambalaya packing dancers in Sunday nights for Deep Groove Society's Sundaze, an expansion to Saturdays was in order. DJ Dub Cowboy put togther mission:CRITICAL teaming with The Middle Agent and J-Sun from Deep Groove. "The music is primarily a mix of Jamaican dancehall with hip hop and underground dubstep and jungle mixed in," says Dub C. "The result is an intense and motivating blend of sounds accompanied by intelligent visual stimulation," which is to say some sort of light show.<P>

The Metal Shakespeare Company returns to the Alibi on Saturday with thirtythreeandathird opening. Formerly known as Dagger of the Mind, Portland's MSC's name explains the concept: It's a metal band using the Bard's words for lyrics. Jason "Lord Simms" from MSC tells me excitedly, "We have some new costumes! We now do the "my kingdom for a horse" scene from Richard III and the Mercutio/Romeo/Tybalt battle scene from Romeo and Juliet! We are now officially authenticated as a reasonable artistic endeavor by performing at the illustrious Oregon Shakespeare Festival where we shockingly went over extremely well, selling out of merch and signing autographs for many a 4th grader." Wanna get in on the action? They'll be offering a part in Macbeth to some special audience member.

Labeled as one of Humboldt county's most prominent party/club dance bands Moo-Got-2 has been creating quite the buzz. With their infectious dance grooves and booty shaking rhythms from start to finish, the band flows effortlessly into a frenzy of funk and rock reminiscent of bands like Galactic, Ween and the Motet. They also have a lot psychedelic moments similar to STS9, Phish and the Disco Biscuits. The great thing about this band is they have their own twist to the jamband element that is unpredictable and exciting. The audience is always paying attention to this and continuously egging the band on. In short Moo-Got-2 is all about fun. The have a great ability to take a simple funk tune and write lyrics that tell stories. They play to the crowd very well night after night blending many different styles such as funk, rock, reggae and latin into an eclectic mix.

"Bustle in your Hedgerow  puts on sporadic shows showcasing only Zep tunes. But don't call them a tribute band. Joe Russo, Marco Benevento, Dave Dreiwitz, and Scott Metzger channel Led Zeppelin's songs with such passion and energy, you would swear they are their own songs." 


<P>
A little more than two years ago, Joe Russo and Marco Benevento took their fledging Duo onto the East River aboard a Rocks Off Boat Cruise in New York City with Rana's Scott Metzger and made waves playing a scintillating set of Zeppelin that was nasty enough to dredge up mob-hit corpses. Since then, they've perfected the act by adding WEEN bassist Dave Dreiwitz. Bustle in your Hedgerow has come on strong lately, selling out packed venues across America. Now, they're bringing the act to Humboldt county for the first time ever, and it will be nasty enough to keep your boogie on til the wee hours. If you ain't heard Metzger go medieval on the Led Zep, you got to hear this... if you have, you've already got your tickets.

...And it is a cover band?!?! To the unsuspecting eye, maybe, but to the trained ear, it is a rock juggernaut, as Marco and Joe team up with old friends Scott Metzger (Rana, Danjaboots) and Dave Dreiwitz (WEEN) to form BUSTLE IN YOUR HEDGEROW. The foursome have wowed crowds around New York for a couple of years now, after being created on a dare from Flaco,  joining together when their schedules allow to drop the ROCK on the city's live music aficianados. The band has taken the show on the road for a smattering of one-off performances, including a beyond sold-out post-Lollapalooza 2006 party that left the Abbey Pub in Chicago in shambles. Now, the band is ready to take this show on the road and they're coming to Eureka, CA.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">New Riders return, plus Blitzen Trapper and Zeppelin backwards
<P>

The name sets the stage: New Riders of the Purple Sage was theoretically an update on a cowboy band from the '30s, which in turn was named for a seminal cowboy novel by Zane Grey, the guy who basically invented the Western genre. The New Riders came together toward the end of the '60s. The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia was renowned as a guitarist, but he was also a fine banjo player and jammed on bluegrass and country tunes with guitarist David Nelson. Hanging around that scene was a kid named John Dawson, aka "Marmaduke", from Millbrook, New York, where Timothy Leary had his psychedelic headquarters. Marmaduke was totally into country from the Bakersfield school, songs by Buck Owens and his Buckaroos and Merle Haggard and the Strangers, with wailing steel guitar, the same kind of thing Gram Parsons was getting into with The Byrds and the Burrito Bothers. Garcia ended up getting his own steel guitar. 
<P>

The original New Riders was Dawson, who wrote most of the songs, Nelson on guitar and Jerry on steel with Dead lyricist Robert Hunter or Phil Lesh on bass and Mickey Hart on drums. (By taking Dawson and Nelson on the road, the Dead had an instant opening act.) The difference from Bakersfield country was cultural: Where Merle and Buck were doing redneck anthems like "Okie from Muskogee," Dawson was a hippie, writing songs like "Dirty Business," a tale of a coal mine strike that ends with the mine blown up. 
<P>

At some point having after the '60s turned into the '70s, having Jerry and others Dead guys in the band stopped making sense and Buddy Cage, who'd played guitar in Great Speckled Bird (with Ian and Sylvia) took over steel chores. Dave Torbert took the bass chair and wrote some songs; Spencer Dryden (from Jefferson Airplane) became the drummer. The Riders even scored a modest hit in 1973 with The Adventures of Panama Red album when the twangy marijuana tune, "Panama Red," became an underground radio staple. The Riders kept rolling into the early '80s then pretty much disbanded, although some other players took over the name for a time. 
<P>

In recent years the band was resurrected with Nelson and assorted sidemen playing the old tunes. The current touring lineup has Nelson and Cage joined by guitarist/mandolinist Michael Falzarano, who's played with Hot Tuna and drummer Johnny Markowski and bassman Ronnie Penque from Stir Fried handling rhythm section duty. Riders management notes that "John Dawson will not be a part of this outing due to some ongoing health concerns, but you can count on these guys not only keeping his tunes alive, but taking them to new places as well." See where they take things on Monday, Dec. 1, when the New Riders ride into town for a show at Humboldt Brews.
<P>

Incidentally, the Riders' hit "Panama Red" was not written by Marmaduke, it was by Peter Rowan, who's coming 'round again Dec. 20, for a show at the Mateel backed by The Free Mexican Airforce. Sharing the bill is Crooked Still, a hot bluegrass combo from Boston, whose current line-up includes former local Tristan Clarridge on fiddle and cello.
<P>

Remember the old preacher fear campaign that claimed Led Zeppelin was inserting Satanic messages into its music, heard only when you spun the record backwards. Allegedly "Starway to Heaven" in reverse became an ode to the Devil around the point when they were singing, "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now." I have no idea what that line actually means, so maybe it was a secret message. Well, today Bustle In Your Hedgerow is the name of a band that's sort of a Zeppelin tribute, but not exactly. Keyboard jammer Marco Benevento and drummer Joe Russo (aka Benevento/Russo Duo) have joined forces with bassist Dave Dreiwitz from WEEN and Particle guitarist Scott Metzger to bustle through various Zep tunes, playing parts backwards, forwards and sideways, just to see what happens. They'll be doing that on Sunday Nov. 30, at Red Fox Tavern. I assure you, this ain't no cover band.
<P>

Country superstar Wynonna Judd plays next Tuesday at the Arkley Center. (Or do we call her just plain Wynonna at this point?) As you might suspect, the show is totally sold out and has been for some time. Curiously, I received an Events.com e-mail this morning listing the show with a link to "Buy Tickets." It led to TicketsNow, one of those semi-official online scalping services. Tickets were available for most of the shows on her holiday tour, some jacked up to $350 or more, but there were none offered for the Eureka show. Maybe the sellers learned their lesson when they tried scalping part of the CenterArts season.
<P>

Walking through town the other day with my friend Willoughby I pointed out a pole flyer for the Blitzen Trapper show coming up Wednesday, Dec. 3, at the Red Fox. From the angular font used for the band-name logo, he figured them for a metal band. They are most definitely not a metal band, although there's an occasional ripping guitar on their latest Sub Pop disc, Furr (reviewed by Zogboy elsewhere in this paper). Most of the guys in Blitzen Trapper grew up in Salem; they're now part of the herd of Portland indie bands. Their sound draws on a wide range of influences: for me, parts bring to mind a those jaunty Brit bands from the late '60s, other times it's Neil Young and/or '90s alt. rock. 
<P>

Furr starts with the folk-rocky title track, a tale about a shapeshifter (or am I just thinking that because I'm hooked on True Blood?) who changes into a teen wolf and lives out in the woods with the pack: "They allowed me to join in and sing their song... howling endlessly at the dawn." Or maybe it's a song about being in a rock band, either way, the protagonist ends up changing back to human form to marry a girl and "settle down upon a farm" to raise a family. Still he dreams of "running careless through the snow" with his old wolf buddies. 
<P>

Blitzen T. is running careless on the road with The Parson Red Heads, a like-minded Sixies-ish band also originally from Oregon, now based out of L.A. The first song that comes up on their MySpace is a cover of "I'm into Something Good," the Goffin/King song made famous by Herman's Hermits. That should give you an idea where they're coming from. I once owned that Hermits' record, but I like the new take better.<P>


The "First Thursday Film" next Thursday, Dec. 4, at the Morris Graves Museum is Helvetica, a cool documentary about the typeface, reviewed in the Journal a few weeks back (again by Zogboy). The music connection? El Ten Eleven, the L.A. post-rock/math duo that played the Alibi recently, did the soundtrack music. Yes, I took that nap and stayed up late to see them, and it was worth it.<P>


As you are no doubt aware, Thursday is Thanksgiving Day, which makes this as good a time as any to give out some thank yous. Thanks to the folks who run the clubs and cafes and assorted other venues that provide a place for all of us to go hear music. And ditto to the promoters who bring in touring bands, often without making any money in the process. Thanks to the sound men, the lighting techs and everyone else who helps the shows come off. An especially big thank you to the musicians who put their blood, sweat and tears out there to entertain us. And last, to readers who have made it this far, thanks for sticking with me, without you there's be no point in writing this column every week. Enjoy the holiday.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Bay Area music legends Moonalice bring their diverse musical stylings to The Red Fox Tavern December 6th
<p>

"Moonalice's music is an eclectic brew of rock, roots, and rhythm-and-blues, peppered with a healthy dose of improvisation and played with some serious chops." 

<p>
Moonalice is a Bay Area band of veteran players and old friends looking to explore new territory together. The high-energy group is composed of G.E. Smith (Bob Dylan, Saturday Night Live) on guitar, Jack Casady (Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna) on bass, Barry Sless (Phil Lesh, David Nelson Band) on guitar and pedal steel, Pete Sears (Jefferson Starship, Hot Tuna) on keys, Ann McNamee (Flying Other Brothers) on vocals and percussion, Roger McNamee (Flying Other Brothers) on guitar and vocals, and Jim Sanchez (Bonnie Raitt, Dr. John) on drums.
<p>
The band has logged quite a few shows in the couple years they've been on the road. Some of which include appearances at San Francisco's colossal and high profile Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in Golden Gate Park in 2007 and 2008. Other outings included Wavy Gravy's Summer of Love Revival, The Grateful Garcia Gathering, the Sausalito Arts Festival, Earthdance,  as well as shows  at a variety of clubs and theaters across the country.
<p>

With a culture based on groove, the tribal members blow minds on guitars, keyboards, and a range of other instruments to prove their worthiness to play the low end. 
<p>
According to legend, the Moonalice tribe is descended from Piltdown Woman, or possibly from a couple of naked, snake charmed gardeners who liked to hang around with friendly dinosaurs. Core to the Moonalice culture is the Coming of the Seventh - Yggdrassil - a mythical player of low tones who emerges periodically from the sea, where he cavorts with a school of thermally enhanced tuna. 
<p>
The myth of Moonalice portends that upon the arrival of the Seventh, the groove will grow impossibly deep. So much so that the words "Dig it" will pass the lips of those who have never before uttered, let alone entertained, such thoughts. 
<p>
The tribe - or band, as it is known in Moonalice culture - plays traditional Moonalice music, an intoxicating brew of roots, blues, psychedelia, and strange but kind folk. In Moonalice tradition, the musical ceremony - the gig - is a fusion of sound, lights, and refreshing beverages that improves reality for people who get too much of the real thing during the day time. 

<p>



Moonalice's new album is produced by legendary producer T. Bone Burnett and is due out in Febuary 2009 !

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>YA HO WA 13  </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">For the first time in 30 years psychedelic-rock pioneers, YaHoWha 13,  are on tour and they're bringing their free spirited musical approach to Humboldt Brews on Wednesday December 17th 

<p>
"The organic fluctuations of sonic chemistry. Wildly primal, Jazzy, Blues-y, Electrical, Contagious,  Always inspired.  This music is so clearly channeled from the Divine.  Unpracticed, unpretentious, yet still wickedly rockable!  Fire. Water. Air. Ether. Earth.  This music combines every element, taking you on an energetic cosmic carpet ride."
<p>
YaHoWha 13 is "reincarnated" with the three surviving members of the original musical "messiah-ship", and legendary, apocalyptic, prophetic, professional, hippie-flower child, love, health, and wisdom collective known in the late 1960's and early 70's to the Hollywood entertainment industry, and LA locals alike, as simply, "The Source". The Source owned and ran the first major vegetarian restaurant in Los Angeles, and in the wee hours of the morning, (4am) in their garage studio in the Hollywood Hills, YaHoWha13, with Father Yod leader of the cult, recorded over 65 albums, 10 of which were released on vinyl and are now fiercely collected as some of the most classic and inspired psychedelic music ever made&.in fact they are considered in underground circles to be among the several bands who specifically created that genre. Their musical musings were recorded, manufactured, and released by the communal family's indie label Higher Key Records between 1972 and 1975 and sold at their restaurant's adjacent record/ book store while performing numerous free concerts at select high schools and college campuses. 
Sunflower [ plays a melodically throbbing bass], Octavius [on traps, tympani, gong, Tibetan bowls, and bells] and Djin [on various electric and acoustic guitars played with feathers, bones, and bows] were the Source Family's three main in house" musician/magicians forming the rhythm section of the various evolving collaborations of the community's talent including, Father Yod and the Spirit of '76, Savage Sons of YaHoWha, Fire Water Air, and YaHoWa13 with Father Yod/Yahowha vocalizing, whistling or playing gong and tympani. Always spontaneous and innovative, YaHoWha 13 explores the roots of tribal psychedelic mayhem, ecstatic trance-fusion, rock and roll revival, and transformative experimental rock about as "far out of the cultural box" of modern musical expression as it gets. They're unpredictable, lost, but always going somewhere absorbing all in its path, leaving ethereal fingerprints in space. An old family saying the band plays by, "live in the now" forms the basis of its musical philosophy, a philosophy revealed to them by Father Yod/Yahowha who left this world in 1975, but whose spirit remains in the band. 
<p>
The band members separated in1977, when the commune dispersed, but their original LPs had a life of their own. By the late 1990's these albums had become so collectable, that due to the efforts of Source members Sky Saxon, lead singer for the Seeds, and Damian Paul, head of the family's HigherKey record label, a 13 cd box set called "The Yahowha Collection" was released on Captain Trip Records in Japan and re-mastered and re-released on Swordfish Records UK. Since then the band's international underground popularity has been steadily growing and once fans, most of whom had not been born when the band was originally formed, having discovered that Sunflower Aquarian, Octavius Aquarian and Djin Aquarian, were still around, wanted to hear and see these superheroes play and rekindle the old sonic alchemy for the first time in 33 years. After they were featured on the cover of "LA Weekly" on Memorial Day of 2007 a reunion gathering happened that November when a mini West Coast tour was arranged for the band. The houses were packed and the trio soared&. Sky Saxon came on stage and sang with the band and it was like the old days at Pandora's Box, or the Whisky A Go Go on Sunset Strip&..a real psychedelic treat. Billy Corgan, of Smashing Pumpkins and Mark Tulin of the Electric Prunes have been known to jump in to jam with Djin, Sky and the 13 behind the scenes as well. In April of 2008, the band played at the Knitting Factory in NY to a full house of diehard psych fans and it then became apparent that the band was back. A three day "NPR" feature about the Source Family also appeared in April of 08 and you can find YaHoWa13 recently in a special feature in "Paper Magazine". 
<p>

An album of YaHoWa 13 called "Feather of Wisdom" [Live at Café Du Nord] was released this year on Soundatone Records and a rare recording of The Spirit of 76, one of the incarnations of the band featuring three of the Source sisters vocalizing on 11 of Djin's rockin' psych-gospel songs called, "Children of the 6th Root Race", was released on the indie world's premier label, Dragcity Records. A live in studio recording is coming out later this year on indie's Prophase Records called, "Sonic Portation" heralding their regrouping. 
<p>
Being a trio leaves a lot of open space to be filled, or not, but you never know who they might transport on stage at any given show to jam with them, maybe you. They are rhythmic, tribal, light, melodic, ancient, modern, and revolving explorers of sound getting the whole place moving or meditating and by the end of the set&"all are one". These ground breaking bros of the psychedelic genre don't hide the fact that they've been around for a while&.but they can still pilot their ship and deliver their cargo with class. If you want to take a trip to the stars, transport back to the 60's or to future destinations, "to be announced at concert", where none have gone before, YaHoWha13 can take you there. Here's what Devendra Banhart has said about the music, "The Source Family has the best album covers hands down! Creation at its purest, just being, present as can be, letting the unknown unfold, raw as the Stooges wasted on Ataraxia, free as the Santa Ana Winds, and rare as an astral encounter with the powers of creation, from Kohoutek to Operetta, the wild saga ever endlessly flows!" (This band of shamans doesn't just play music; they channel for their audiences just like they did for the family, cosmic and divine energies for heart-head and soul. Sometimes primitive, sometimes contemporary, sometimes without time, but when it comes to where YaHoWha13 is willing to go&.there are no limits. Get ready to go on a never before played cosmic journey through the elemental kingdoms of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth on to the celestial star gates of the surrounding galaxy and beyond, into the infinite within&&&&&.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Mateel Launches Fundraising Effort </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">As the Mateel Community Center awaits long overdue payments from its settlement of the legal dispute with Tom Dimmick, Carol Bruno, and People Productions, the center finds itself in dire financial straights and is looking to the community for support to help keep the organization afloat in these tough financial times.  While Mateel remains hopeful that these debts, which currently total over $250,000, will be paid soon, not having these funds in hand on the timeframe agreed upon in the settlement is now causing concern over the Mateels ability to maintain operations in 2009.  <P>
With a recent court ruling that supports the centers ability to use whatever means necessary to collect, the MCC board now has a variety of options to consider and will begin to evaluate assets of the various parties who owe the center money.  While this may provide some assurance that these overdue payments will be made good on eventually, this process will likely take months or longer to bear fruit.  As it stands currently, MCC has operating capital sufficient to continue operations through the beginning of February 2009, after which the center will be forced to close its doors and cancel its programs and events if the settlement money continues to remain unpaid.  With a number of rentals already on the calendar for next year, closing the doors would have immeasurable impact on a large number of community groups and hall users and would also have severe, if not irreversible, affects on the centers ability to produce treasured annual events such as the Summer Arts and Music Festival, Reggae on the River, Recycled Youth, and the many other community and youth programs central to our local identity.<P>
In an effort to stem this harsh, but seriously potential reality, the Mateel Community Center is now launching a major fundraising effort to try and raise $100,000 by the end of January 2009.  These funds will be used as operating capital, allowing the center to keep it doors open, continue with our precious annual programs and services, and maintain a core staff to attend to the basic operational needs of the center while continuing to implement and refine the business plan the Mateel has been operating under since January 2008.  This plan represents the first time in many years that the center has sought to cover operations with the value of its inherent assets and a key aspect of its success was in the production of increased in-house events and programs to raise the necessary operating capital.  By in large, the business plan was highly successful and came very near to covering the total operational expense of the center in 2008.  With some minor adjustments to the event plan and the communitys support to continue on this course, MCC is confident that the plan for 2009 would not only cover operations, but also leave enough at the end of the year to begin with the following years planning.<P>
  While Mateel recognizes that $100,000 is a lot of money to raise in a short amount of time, there is hope that local patrons who recognize the value of the center and its events/ programs will consider becoming a lifetime member.  With a current membership totaling over 700 and conservative estimates of more than 10,000 users of the hall in 2008, if only 100 of these people were to step up their commitment to the center with lifetime memberships, MCC could easily achieve this goal.  For those who would like to support, but are not in a position to make this kind of contribution, basic membership in the organization is also crucial and 2009 memberships are currently available.  And, there are still two MCC events left before the end of the year, both of which will support this fundraising effort.  These events are the 32nd annual Winter Arts Faire on December 13-14 and MCCs final concert of 2008 on December 20 with Peter Rowan & The Free Mexican Air Force, Crooked Still, and a chili cook-off.  Please come out for these great events and help the Mateel in its Herculean efforts to keep the center operational in the absence of the critical settlement funds from Dimmick, Bruno, and People Productions.  For more information about the events, programs, and services of the Mateel Community Center and how you can get involved, please stop by the MCC office in Redway, call 923-3368, or send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a252c2c23292f0a272b3e2f2f266425382d">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

Stars, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and Giant People. Once again, dancing shoes advised.
<P>
I've never fully understood why Richard Thompson never achieved the popularity and the cultural icon status of some of his compatriots. He's a stellar guitar player  when Rolling Stone magazine assembled a list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, he was in the top 20. And his songwriting is absolutely brilliant. Songs like "1952 Vincent Black Lightning" and "Beeswing" are perfect short stories in and of themselves with subtle guitar lines that fit like a glove, and when he rocks out, he kills. So why isn't he a star and a household name?
Stars, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and Giant People. Once again, dancing shoes advised.
<P>

Thompson has been at it for four decades now having begun his career in 1967 with the British folk-rock band Fairport Convention while still a teen. He went solo in the '70s, then married a singer, Linda Peters. Richard and Linda toured and recorded together for just short of a decade. Their eventual divorce is laid out in heart-wrenching, sometimes bitter songs that are perhaps too honest for most. His work since is less bitter, but never less honest and powerful.
Stars, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and Giant People. Once again, dancing shoes advised.
<P>
Thompson regularly answers questions from his dedicated fans on his official website, BeesWeb. Amid gear geek queries, some did-you-reallys (Did you really play with Jimi? Yes) and a few when-might-you-play-here questions, someone asked about the "greatest Spinal Tap moment" in his career. His wry description of a date with Fairport Convention offers a further clue as to detours on the road to stardom.  Stars, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and Giant People.

"Fairport did a BBC radio show in front of a live audience, must have been 1970," he writes. "Mott The Hoople, then little-known, opened for us, but their fans snapped up all the free tickets, so they went down a storm, and we died the death. Thinking our careers over, we repaired to the pub, got plastered, and mused on the fickle nature of the pop world. We decided that we needed a bit more showmanship in the act, and thought that Motts stage antics, i.e. knee-length boots, choreographed guitar moves, rubbing fretboards together, head-banging, etc., would be the way to catch the next generation of fans. Sure enough, next show, which I think was Leicester, a couple of the band had got the boots, and towards the end of the set, we started to ham it up, pissing ourselves with laughter, of course. Needless to say, it went down an absolute storm. The crowd went wild. This was very depressing, and confirmed our suspicion that audiences were gullible idiots. We tried it one more time after that, and then settled on careers of mediocre sales and obscurity."

So there you have it. He decided early on that obscurity was preferable to playing to the wants of gullible idiots. Of course he's not totally obscure.

Got a call last week from Karen Dumont, one of my favorite soul/blues/gospel singers. She's moved back to town, done with Oregon, and next Tuesday, Dec. 9, she'll be the host (or hostess) of the weekly Jambalaya Blues Jam. That date just happens to be her birthday. Would I come down and let her buy me a drink? Of course I already knew she was born that day. Regular readers may recall the story of one Dec. 9 many years ago: I was at the Jam and overheard someone toasting Karen on her birthday. My response was something like that Beatles song: "You say it's your birthday, well it's my birthday too..." When we compared notes we discovered we were born on the same day and in the same year. So yes, I'll stop by for a drink and a taste of the blues (after I go see the Anat Cohen Quartet play jazz in the KBR, see the Calendar section for details on that show).

There's a legend about the origins of Moonalice, something about a Native American tribe, hippies and hemp. The band today is a harbinger: "A new day has begun. A daring sextet of nomads has emerged to revive the tribe, its music, and its legend. The new Moonalice crosses the land, spreading good vibes and giving new hope to millions whose culture had been laid waste by the prohibition of hemp. With each gig, the tribe grows.

A spectacular program of unique images and creative critters, Imago's presentation will surprise kids from 3 to 103. Arms are really legs, up is down and back is front in this presentation. Entertaining since 1978, co-founders and directors Carol Triffle and Jerry Mouawad draw upon their training in the Jacque LeCoq method to create characters that are both fantastic and touchingly human.
<P>
In addition to being adept in theatrical movement, Triffle and Mouawad are also talented in the plastic arts. Using any and all materials, the pair create masks that defy definition, incorporating not only the face but the body as well. Additional use of music and multimedia effects combine for a truly unique theatrical experience. 
<P>
American imagination and flair has allowed this company to travel the world entertaining audiences in Europe, Asia and America with their blend of multimedia and theatrical ingenuity. Their program has drawn the praise of critics from San Francisco to Singapore. The New York Times said Imago's performance left everyone...feeling giggly. The Seattle Post Intelligencer called Imago entrancing and clever, and The Oregonian said, next time (they are) playing within 50 miles, gather up the children and go.

to sing with this musical legend!
<P>
Bobby McFerrin is one of the natural wonders of the music world. A ten-time Grammy Award winner, he is one of the world's best-known vocal innovators and improvisers, a world-renowned classical conductor, the creator of one of the most popular songs of the late 20th century , Dont Worry, Be Happy. His recordings have sold over 20 million copies, and his collaborations with Yo-Yo Ma, the Vienna Philharmonic and Herbie Hancock have established him as an ambassador of both the classical and jazz worlds. Yet McFerrin's reach extends well beyond musical circles: he's worked with actor Jack Nicholson, comedians Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, the Muppets and audiences around the world. to sing with this musical legend!
<P>

With a four-octave range and a vast array of vocal techniques, McFerrin is no mere singer; he is music's last true Renaissance man, a vocal explorer who has combined jazz, folk and a multitude of world music influences - choral, a cappella, and classical music - with his own ingredients. As a conductor, he is able to hear orchestrally, and with this gift has expanded his singing to include more imaginative territory than most; he might extend his vocal repertoire to sing trumpet-inspired parts in the jazz standard Round Midnight or to interpret the flute and cello parts in works by Fauré and Vivaldi, or to simply create entirely new sounds. to sing with this musical legend!
<P>

In 1983 Bobby McFerrin did his first tour of Europe as an unaccompanied vocalist, performing without any prepared material. Audiences were bewildered at first, and then blown away. Tapes of those concerts were made into the album The Voice, a landmark recording that served notice of the arrival of a major musical talent the German critics called Stimmwunder, which means wonder voice.  Throughout the 1980s McFerrin continued to develop his amazing solo improvisations and audience interactions and won his first Grammy in 1985 for Another Night in Tunisia with the Manhattan Transfer.  Further Grammy awards came for Bernard Taverniers Round Midnight and How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin, with Jack Nicholson in 1987.    
to sing with this musical legend!
<P>
In 1988 he released the album Simple Pleasures, which paid homage to the music of the 1960s.   Shortly after Simple Pleasures was nominated for a 1988 Grammy for album of the year, while Don't Worry, Be Happy won both the Record of the Year and the coveted Song of the Year awards. It might just as well have been named Song of the Decade, as "Don't Worry, Be Happy" hit the #1 spot on pop charts in almost every country in the world. to sing with this musical legend!
<P>

In recent years, he has combined his love of improvisation with his conducting skills, extending his vocal journeys to larger groups of singers - whether trained or not. McFerrin's solo concerts have always included audience participation; McFerrin sees them not as singalongs, but as a genuine collaborative process of making music in the moment. Dont miss your chance to sing with this musical legend!

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Absynth Q and friends, Crooked Still at the Mateel, and folks home for the holidays
<P>
I heard it through the grapevine, second-, maybe third-hand: Absynth Quintet was allegedly breaking up  again. A distraught Lila Nelson heard the story and offered mediation services. When I put the breakup question to AQ guitarist Ryan Roberts, he replied with a paraphrase from Mark Twain: "The rumors of our death have been greatly exaggerated," adding, "Don't know how that got started but we are all fine and dandy." And I'll testify that everything seemed fine and dandy when I saw the band play gypsy-ish jazz at the Jambalaya during last Friday's Art! Arcata. <P>

Ryan also notes that AQ has a gig Friday, Dec. 19, at the Red Fox Tavern with some very special guests. Former AQ fiddler Zebulon Bowles is back in town with his friend Rushad Eggleston, master of the electric cello. "Rushad is bringing up his own band, Tornado Ride, but will also play with us and Zeb," says Ryan. 
<P>
For those unfamiliar with the work of Mr. Eggleston, he's a Berklee College of Music grad who pioneered the use of electric cello in bands like Fiddlers 4 and Darol Anger's Republic of Strings. In 2004 he founded the band Crooked Still with several other like-minded alt. bluegrass types in the Boston area. About a year ago he left that band to go his own way and form Tornado Rider, where he promises "a one-of-a-kind mystical experience driven by the mammoth power of an electric cello" and "powerful anthems about falcons, whirlwinds and pretty girls, which will haunt your brain for weeks." 
<P>
By chance Rushad's former band Crooked Still is playing locally this weekend as part of a Year End Mateel Party and Chili Cook-off taking place Saturday at the Mateel (of course). Headlining that show are SoHum faves Peter Rowan and The Free Mexican Air Force, led by songwriter/Dead associate Rowan, the guy who wrote "Panama Red" for New Riders, among many other great tunes.
<P>
I'm pretty sure this is the first Humboldt appearance for Crooked Still. It's also a homecoming of sorts for one of the band members. After Eggleston left the band in 2007, two new players were signed up: cellist Tristan Clarridge and fiddler Brittany Haas, both of them coming from Anger's Republic of Strings. Local fiddle fans will recognize Tristan as one of the Clarridge Family Fiddlers (with his sister Tashina). Tristan is a champ: In fact he was the youngest winner of the Grand National Fiddle Championships in Weiser, ID, and he's managed to adapt those skills to play innovative bluegrass and Celtic music on cello. 
<P>
Re: the Chili Cook-Off, the Mateel folks are "seeking anyone with a great chili recipe to put their skills to the test and enter this competition." Bring a big pot o' vegetarian or meat chili and serving equipment and you get one free ticket to the event plus a shot at a prize package including a 2009 MCC membership, a Mateel hat and T-shirt, "and more." 
<P>
Thursdays at the Red Fox are typically have reggae DJ Jimmy Jonz on turntables; this Thursday, Dec 18, he'll have some guests in for a "massive all star show!" Ace Deuce features guitarist Ray White (formerly of the Mothers of Invention, KVHW, etc.), bassist Bobby Vega (formerly of Sly and the Family Stone, Zero, KVHW, etc.) with locals B. Swiz (keys), Chris Noonan (saxes), Nate Krystaff (guitar) and Tofu Mike Schwartz on drums.
<P>
You'll also find Tofu at the Red Fox Saturday, Dec. 20, when Play Dead gathers for another tribute to the Grateful Dead etc. Rumor has it (via the grapevine) that former local keyboard wiz Mike Emerson will be in town for the pre-holiday bash. After Xmas, hard-workin' Mike has a couple of dates with bluesman Tommy Castro, then hits the road with Carlene Carter (June's daughter).
<P>
You've heard about hot yoga. Well, on Friday, Dec. 19, try WoMama's Winter Hot Box, a sweat-inducing all-ages blast at Redwood Raks featuring Afrockers WoMama plus the Janky Mallets' samba drumline, and worldbeat DJ Whitebeard (who lives down the street from me). "Come add to the fire," urges Jesse J, singer for WoMama and leader of JM.
<P>
As part of a jazzy weekend, head over to Muddy's Hot Cup Saturday evening, Dec. 20, to hear Bill Allison's Redwood Jazz Voices, an ensemble featuring Bill on piano leading a group that includes vocalists Calista LaBolle (Mike's daughter), Lorenza Simmons (Madi's daughter and a member of AkaBella), and Bill's son, Clay Allison with Bill Andrews on bass and Brian Blakely on percussion. Allison has been doing a jazz piano brunch at Muddy's in recent weeks, including pieces done with some of his voice students (ranging from eight-year-olds to grown-ups). "Sunday's are more straight-ahead jazz, familiar tunes, some of my favorites," said Allison. Redwood Jazz Voices is something different. "It's a body of work that comes out of my work for the last 20 years," said Allison, "progressive jazz with voices as instruments on tunes by Monk, Mingus, Miles, McCoy Tyner and the like."<P>

After brunch Sunday, head over to the Morris Graves Museum for the afternoon Jazz Jam (from 2-4:30) featuring pianist Darius Brotman with bassist Shao Way Wu and drummer Ed Campbell and young Rose Armin-Hoiland on vocals. I've heard Rose sing a couple of times  she has a fine and mellow jazz voice and will surely go far. And in case you were wondering, they will not be doing any Christmas music. "You can count on that," promised Brotman.<P>

Around this time last year we were telling you about Eureka homegirl Sara Bareilles coming home for the holidays and a sold out show at the Eureka Theater. She's back this weekend, this time playing two nights Arkley Center  both sold out almost instantly. For those who have not been paying attention, Sara's career has taken quantum leaps since she was here last. Her hit single Love Song, had already gone to No. 1 on the charts, and hung in the top 10 for weeks, now it's in the running for a Song of the Year Grammy. It doesnt get much bigger than that. But wait, shes also in the running for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Apple announced that her album, Little Voice, ranked in the top five for iTunes sales in 2008.<P>

Former Weary Boy Mario Matteoli will be at the Jambalaya Monday Dec. 22, for a long-awaited Jackson Brothers reunion. In case you've forgotten former locals Detroit, Mudpit, Harpdog and Motorcycle Jackson, they've moved on to fame and fortune with The 3 Heads, Ignit and of course The Weary Boys. Like Sara they're home for the holly-daze, ready to play.<P>

Last week we were talking about Making Blindness Fashionable 2008, the comp assembled by James Forbes to benefit Humboldt Council of the Blind. He disc is an awesome yet poignant snapshot of the Humboldt indie scene at a particular point just passed, poignant since many of the bands have since split and/or moved on (as almost all bands do). HCB's Peggy Martinez' No Not Yet is on there (she's off to Seattle). You've got The Ian Fays and The Broken Hearts (both moved), Eureka Garbage Co. (split), The Buffy Swayze (split), plus Dynamite Sweater singing about opening for The Buffy Swayze. And James has a couple of his ex-bands on there: Arrogant Hare and Henpecker (both split). You're not going to get all those Humpty Dumpty bands back together again; this will have to do. Get one at an indie music store near you, at the Lighthouse of the North Coast in Eureka, or with PayPal on myspace.com/methbogrecords. 
<P>
With that shopping tip, I bid you season's greetings and adieu. I'm off 'til Xmas. Look for a sub-Hummer next week. Peace.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">On Friday, January 16th at Humboldt Brews in Arcata, local quintet NPK will be performing a full set of original songs that will create a great circumstance to dance and have fun. There is also a bigger meaning to the show, and that is to raise money, awareness, and membership to the local non-profit organization; The Humboldt Surfrider Foundation. The Surfrider Foundation is an environmental organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the world's oceans, waves and beaches for all people, through conservation, activism, research, and education. The Humboldt chapter is one of over 80 chapters world wide. <P>
One of Surfrider Foundations first and largest victories was a successful Clean Water Act lawsuit filed in 1989 and settled in 1991 against pulp mills in Humboldt County, California that were operated by Simpson Paper Company and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation. These pulp mills used chlorine in the Kraft bleaching process to turn brown wood pulp into white paper. The mills discharged approximately 40 million gallons per day of untreated wastewater into the near-shore surf zone. This wastewater contained excessive concentrations of Biological Oxygen Demand and suspended solids, had a pH value outside of the permit limits, and contained dioxins and furans, extremely toxic chemicals created by the use of chlorine in the bleaching process. Surfers in the area of the discharge complained of skin rashes and nausea. The mills also produced hazardous, irritating air emissions. The settlement won by Surfrider Foundation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (at the time, one of the largest penalties levied by the EPA under the Clean Water Act, and the largest in the Western U.S.) required the pulp mills to construct wastewater treatment facilities to eliminate toxic discharges to the ocean and extend their ocean outfall pipes. The mills also agreed to evaluate the elimination of the use of chlorine in the pulp bleaching process through substitution of chlorine dioxide and/or hydrogen peroxide in an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) or Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) process. The Louisiana-Pacific mill became the first TCF bleached Kraft pulp mill in the U.S. in 1993.<P>
Now that the coastline is being threatened by the prospect of major oil drilling it is more important than ever to be informed and organized in order to protect our scenic shores for future generations to enjoy. The NPK is helping to organize this show in the hope that the North Coast Community can come together using music, dance, and entertainment mixed with responsible activism and education in order to resist the degradation of the health of our environment and the quality of our lifestyle. The music will start around 9:30 p.m. and go late into the night. A donation of $8.00 at the door goes to funding the future projects of The Humboldt Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">CenterArts presents Kodo on Monday, February 2nd at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. Traditional rituals recast as theater, and contemporary thoughts about ancient instruments both figure in Kodo's performance, which includes ancient and modern compositions. Yet with tense, angular postures, with stylized, frozen gestures and, in one playful piece, with animal-like scampering and slithering, Kodo reminds its audience that, above all, its music is a matter of flesh and blood, wood and stretched skin. Kodo can raise the roof, but the group can also show extraordinary finesse." ~ wrote The New York Times. Tickets are $45 general, $40 Senior/Child and $25 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.
<P>

Kodo is a group whose activities are centered on the Japanese drum, or taiko. While exploring the countless byways of the traditional performing arts we strive to create something new for the modern age. The name Kodo conveys two meanings. The literal readings of the two characters that make up the name in Japanese are drum and child - conveying Kodo's desire to play the taiko purely, with the heart of a child. The word Kodo is also a homonym for heartbeat - humanity's most fundamental source of rhythm - the first sound a child hears in their mother's womb.
<P>

Since Kodo's debut at the Berlin Festival in 1981, one third of the year has spent touring Japan, a third on Sado Island, and the rest of the year touring overseas. On our One Earth Tour we have given over 3,000 widely acclaimed performances in 43 countries, from war-torn Croatia to America's Carnegie
 Hall.
<P>

The world is a kaleidoscope of people and cultures. In this age of exploding populations and lightening-fast communication it is more important than ever that these diverse cultures learn to recognize and accept each other so that all may share our increasingly shrinking planet in harmony. Since ancient times the taiko has been a symbol of community - serving as a link among people, and people and the heavens. On the One Earth Tour we will continue to bring the sound of the taiko to the ears of the world - and with the taiko's unique ability to transcend the barriers of language and custom - remind us all of our membership in that larger community: the world.
<P>

There are three principal elements in the make-up of a Kodo performance. The first is that of pieces based upon traditional folk arts, learned from local people throughout Japan. The intention is not simply to replicate, but, in rearranging them for the stage, attempt to capture their universal spirit and energy as they filter through our bodies. Art rooted in the soil developed through an intimate relationship between the people and their art, and between art and nature. <P>


The second element of the performance is made up of compositions of friends and mentors of Kodo. These include composers Maki Ishii and Shinichiro Ikebe, Kabuki orchestra musicians Roetsu Tosha and Kiyohiko Senba, and jazz pianist Yousuke Yamashita. <P>


The third element consists of original compositions of Kodo members themselves, who have used their exposure to the rhythms and sounds of the many people and places they have been lucky enough to visit as grist for their own creations.
<P>

The performance begins with the blending of these three elements with our lives amidst the sights and sounds of Sado Island, and then is forged into its final shape on the anvil of rehearsal. <P>


The New York Times wrote that . . . [Kodo] created waves of percussive sound that seemed to turn Carnegie Hall itself into a resonant cavity covered with animal skin.

Dr. Dooom) with Kutmasta Kurt and DJ Dub Cowboy on Tuesday, February 24th at 10 p.m. at Humboldt Brews in Arcata, Ca. Kool Keith first emerged as part of the legendary New York crew, the Ultramagnetic MCs, back in 1987. At a time when rap was slowly making the transition from B-Boy braggadocio to a more aggressive, politicized stance, the group quickly established themselves as lyrical innovators with such classics albums as Critical Beatdown. Kool Keith has been responsible for now-classic hip-hop records, each one a testament to his bugged out sensibility and lyrical genius: Sex Style, his album under his own name, started it off, followed by the legendary Dr. Dooom. But the one that garnered him the most notoriety and praise was the 1996 classic Dr Octagonecologyst. Produced by Dan the Automator, Kool Keith played the role of a sexually deviant doctor, telling tales that dropped the jaws of everyone who heard it. Tickets are $25 general and $20 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.<P>

After several well received comedy shows in 2008, the Mateel Community Center is proud to announce the return of regular comedy nights and the kick off event for 2009 will be on Friday, February 6th.  Transforming the Mateel Community Center into an intimate comedy club, complete professional comedians, full bar, candlelit tables, and even table service, the Mateel Comedy Night is Southern Humboldts only venue to catch up and coming professional comedians.<P>
While the series eschews the star power of big name comedians, big laughs are still in store as the best and brightest underground talent from across the U.S. take part in the series.  This first Mateel Comedy Night of 2009 will showcase headliner, Myk Powell, a Paso Robles, CA native who has the distinction of being the only fat, white guy to be a return performer on HBOs Def Comedy Jam, and feature comedian, Jesse Allison, a pro who got his start in Cleveland, OH, did a stint with The Second City, and now resides in Portland, OR where he has been taking the west coast by storm.<P>
Doors for Mateel Comedy Night will open at 8pm and admission is at the door only.  The event is offered at a sliding scale of $10 and up and will directly support the continuation of a regular comedy series at the Mateel Community Center.

Where: Mateel Community Center (Redway, CA)<P>

Why: Rocking music in a fundraiser for MCC!<P>



This Friday, January 23rd, Maiden Humboldt and the Mateel Community Center are proud to present Winter Rock at the Mateel in Redway.  A fundraiser for MCC, this rocking evening will feature SoHums brand new melodic metal band, International Trash, opening for headlining act, Whole Lotta Rosies. <P>

L.A.'s premier all-girl AC/DC tribute band, Whole Lotta Rosies has been written about in numerous magazines, recorded tracks on various CDs, toured for the U.S. Troops overseas, traveled across the country for events and festivals, and appeared in feature films (including a role as Dylan McDermott's back-up band in Unbeatable Harold).  They were founded in Los Angeles in 2000 by rhythm guitarist, Trudi "T-Bird" Keck, making them one of the first all-girl AC/DC tribute acts anywhere and the first in Los Angeles. 
<P>
"The Los Angeles music scene was flooded with male tribute bands that were selling out venues left and right," says Trudi. "Female groups in Los Angeles were few and far between. I went to a club on Melrose one night and saw a female fronted original band. In the middle of the set they covered a Led Zeppelin song. The crowd went nuts! And the singer sounded amazing doing it! Right then and there I decided to put together an AC/DC tribute band, because that had always been one of my favorite bands. Not just female fronted, but all girls! Within a few weeks after setting up auditions and scheduling rehearsals, the band was well on its way."
  <P>
Nearly ten years later now, The Rosies are still going strong and are recognized as one of the best tribute acts in the business. In fact, Whole Lotta Rosies was named "Most Outstanding Female Tribute Band" for three years in a row, 2005-2007, by Rock City News, L.A.'s longest running and most respected rock & roll magazine.  Lead guitarist, "Angus" Nancy Luca, was also named "Best Female Guitar Player 2006" at the Rock City News awards, while lead vocalist, Coreen Sheehan, who is often called "the female Bon Scott", also picked up the award for "Most Outstanding Female Lead Vocalist" two years running.<P>
  
According to Trudi, the current line up is the strongest that Whole Lotta Rosies has ever had. We have a talented group of beautiful girls who have each led or been a part of other girl bands that have enjoyed local, national, and worldwide recognition. These girls know what it takes to keep it going.  The group is comprised of Coreen Sheehan on vocals, Trudi Keck on rhythm guitar, Nancy Luca on lead guitar, Melanie Sisneros on bass, and Ellen Kotheimer on drums. 
<P>
Trudi continues by saying that musicians dream of playing the greatest songs ever written, seeing the crowd going crazy, selling out venues, and touring the world. We're doing exactly that! These are not our songs. True. We're a tribute band, but we're living our dreams. We get to do what we like to do. We have a good time. The crowd has a good time. That's everything that matters."<P>

Advance tickets for Winter Rock are on sale now at Wild Horse Records in Garberville and at The Works in Eureka and Arcata.  Advance tickets are $13 and the price at the door will be $15.  Doors open at 8pm with snacks and refreshments available.  A 21 & over bar will be upstairs and will benefit MCC.  For more information or to volunteer, call the Mateel office at 923-3368.  Additional show info can also be found on both www.mateel.org and at www.maidenhumboldt.com.  Dont miss what is sure to be an awesome kick off to the Mateel Community Centers 2009 season of events as Whole Lotta Rosies and International Trash come to Winter Rock this Friday, January 23rd. For those about to rock, we salute you.

Tickets are $15 general and $7.50 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU. The Works in Eureka or Arcata or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.<P>

One of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling independent hip-hop artists of this era, Lyrics Born is not the type to sit still. While recording his fourth solo album, completing new projects, and making decisions at Quannum Projects, he still averaged over 150 sold-out shows a year. He's a whirlwind.
<P>
Everywhere At Once is not just the title of Lyrics Born's latest and most accomplished record to date. In an age of narrowcasting and niche marketing, the new record reflects LB's determination to follow his own muse wherever it will lead him. I stuck to my guns, he says on the trunk-busting opener, Don't Change. I'm about the funk.
<P>
His breakthrough solo debut, Later That Day, was a huge indie seller and one of the top 5 most critically acclaimed American hip-hop records of 2003 alongside Jay-Z's The Black Album and Outkast's Love Below/Speakerboxxx. With the release of Everywhere At Once, rapper/producer Lyrics Born finds himself part of a new vanguard of hip-hop artists like Gnarls Barkley, M.I.A., and Kanye West who are pushing the edge with compelling yet instantly accessible sounds.

<P>
plus Janiva Magness and Inaugural happenings 
<P>
It was five and a half years ago when I met the self-described "Humboldt independent high-energy dance-rock quintet" called NPK backstage at Reggae on the River. A lot has happened to the SoHummers since then: Members went from 20-something to 30-ish, babies were born, the band grew from a trio and recorded three full-length albums. Their latest, The Current, is set to debut officially Thursday, Jan. 22, with the requisite CD release party at the Mateel (with Sub Sab and This Dying Wish). But first, there's a benefit for Humboldt Surfriders, Friday night at Humboldt Brews. 
<P>
Benefits are something NPK does well. As guitarist Tanner Speas explained, "When we did the second album, Attraction/Reaction, we put together the 'Southern Humboldt World Tour.' We played two or three times a week for about a month and a half, played all the little rural neighborhoods in the area organizing benefit shows for volunteer fire departments, schools, environmental and civil liberty organizations, youth groups, all the nonprofits we could help. In the end, we raised about $50 grand. That established a reputation for us and it also gave what we do more meaning. If all you are is a band trying to get people to come watch what you do, that's not much. What we try to do is connect with bigger purposes."
<P>
While some of the band's songs are about partying and relationships, they also touch on more serious subjects. "I try to write about issues that are on my mind," said Tanner, "things that are happening in the local community or in the world. We have a song on the new album called 'Frog in the Pot.' It's basically talking about the climate crisis and my emotional reactions to that. We had a song about the same subject, 'Drive to More,' on our last album. I used the analogy of this thing in our culture where people step on the gas to try to get there faster, do more, achieve more, that kind of motivation, when it really all ties back to fossil fuel consumption. And where does that really lead us? Nowhere in a hurry."
<P>
As noted here last week, blues singer Janiva Magness is headed somewhere in a hurry, to the Riverwood for a show this Saturday, then in May to the Blues Music Awards, where she's nominated for four awards including "Album of the Year" for her latest on Alligator, What Love Will Do, and "Entertainer of the Year." She's won a BMA before  for "Contemporary Blues Female Artist of the Year"  but that does not mean she's on easy street? 
<P>
"I have a very rich full life these days. I'm grateful for that," she said when I called her L.A. home. "Some days are better than others. I will say that being a musician or a blues artist is not for the faint at heart. It's an intense struggle, and it can be really really glorious.
<P>
"The landscape of playing live music, doing it for a living, has changed, and that includes the blues. I have this theory: Blues music has always been around and will always be here. How that happens changes as the world is changing, but people really need live music; it's such a tremendous healing force. People need to hear real people playing real instruments; it's about human connection. And blues is the music of the people, so it's not going away."
<P>
It's a rare a week that goes by in Humboldt without a major reggae or dancehall show. This week it's the ever-so smooth vocalist Barrington Levy on Wednesday, Jan. 21, at Toph's House in Benbow (an early show with DJ Selecta Prime on at 8). Coming to Toph's Tuesday, Feb. 2: reggae-pop icon Maxi Priest.
<P>
Fickle Hillbillies' guitarist John Chapman called to note an addition to that band's Saturday show at the Red Fox: It's now a double bill with The Miracle Show (who also play Friday at Mosgo's). "We're doing this with them because they're more of a draw, being a Grateful Dead cover band and all," admitted Chapman, noting that bass player Norman Bradford plays and sings in both bands. A reminder, despite the name, the Hillbillies play rock, so don't expect any old timey or bluegrass.
<P>
For bluegrass on the alt. side with fine pickin', tight vocal harmonies and an occasional Dead cover, check Greensky Bluegrass, a string jamband from Kalamazoo on the road behind their fourth album, Five Interstates, taking the Arcata off-ramp for a Monday night show at Humboldt Brews.   
<P>
That Monday, Jan. 19, is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with added significance this year. The local chapter of the NAACP is holding their usual lunchtime celebration at the Adorni Center starting at noon, with the theme "I See the Promised Land." They'll have speeches, poetry and music, including the new Spanky and Our Gang, which includes Spanky McFarlane and my friend Karen Dumont, plus Karen's new vocal group, Echoes of Glory, with Donna Landry and Doug Vanderpool among others.
<P>
As I'm sure you're aware, next Tuesday marks the (final) end of one administration and the (hope-filled) beginning of another, and Humboldt County is ready to celebrate. Professional scene-ster and part-time musician Terrance McNally tells us of one end-of event: "Area bands Side Iron and Magnum [of which T-McN is a member] are joining forces at the Alibi for Operation Mission Accomplished: a Tribute to the Nation's 43rd President. 'This is historic times,' George Walker Bush once quipped. This is indeed. On Tuesday Bush leaves office after eight years of protecting Americans from internationalism, the U.S. Constitution and the Democrat Party. Both bands opted to take their message of decisiveness and OB/GYN love directly to the most liberal corner of the county. Songs such as 'Shock and Awe,' 'I Ain't One for Fancy Talk' and 'Where Wings Take Dream' will be performed. Attendees are encouraged to keep hope to a minimum." Note: The show is not on Inauguration Day, it's Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Alibi.
<P><P>
Tuesday, Jan. 20, in The Big Day and there'll be dancing in the streets in D.C. and around the world as Barack Obama is inaugurated as our new president. Locally we have a number of options: Jambalaya has an "Inaugural Ball" to be broadcast live on KHUM with deejay Mike Dronkers as host. Supplying the musical soundtrack at the Jam: Absynth Quintet and The Sundown Poachers from Siskiyou County. Says Mike-D., "It's going to be mayhem, but mayhem for, by, and of the people."
<P>
Humboldt Brews' Inaugural evening has kick-ass foot-stompin' Americana from Rev. Peyton's Big Damn Band with UKEsperience opening. You'll find more American music across town at Muddy's Hot Cup that night as our own Striped Pig Stringband plays host to The Flat Iron Stringband on their biodiesel-fueled "Hard Times in the Country" Winter tour. FIS' hope is that "down-home music that everyone can relate to" will "bring people's hearts back to the music of Appalachian barn dances ... just as the Carter Family spread the 'Sunny Side of Life' to Depression-era families through the radio waves..."
<P>
For American music of a different stripe, check the Myka 9 "Welcoming in a New Prez Party" at the Red Fox Inaug Night. Myka has Humboldt connections (he worked with J the Sarge and DJ Drez as Magic Heart Genies), but he comes out of the legendary Freestyle Fellowship and the L.A. Good Life/Project Blowed scene. He's on The 1969 Tour, behind an awesome new disc named for the year he was born, trading rapid-fire rhymes on the road with the likes of Sole (from Anticon), Ceschi and Factor (from Fake Four Inc.) plus Meeting of the Minds.
<P>
Dell'Arte hosts an Inaugural Ball at the Carlo including a replay of Obama's inaugural address (the real time ceremony starts at 11:30 a.m. D.C time). Aretha Franklin sings at the Washington version; The Bayou Swamis play in Blue Lake, where you are invited to come dressed as your favorite politician and contribute something warm to a "Brother, can you spare a dime?" clothing drive.

"Hope" is the word of the day. Keep it alive.

(1)  Flat Iron String Band at Muddy's Hot Cup - Tuesday, Jan 20th<P>

Our friendly old time concert coordinator Colin is back with another stringband show this month! Come down to Muddy's Hot Cup in northtown Arcata on Tuesday, January 20th, for the Flat Iron String Band - a young, vibrant ensemble playing traditional American music, carried by fiddle, fretless banjo, guitar and bass. Local pluckers of the Striped Pig will open the show. Tune into 'Chicken Scratch' on KHUM (104.3/104.7 and streaming live at http://www.khum.com) on Monday, January 19th at 6 pm for a preview with the band, or visit them on MySpace at http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=412752576
<P>
Ranging from Appalachian oldtime square dance music to 1950's honky tonk and original takes on old standbys, Flat Iron's country duet vocals and whoop-and-holler dance tunes evoke a older sound and emotion. They envision themselves as a bit of a throwback to mountain-country life in those hollers and foothills of the Appalachian range, while still incorporating the modern day approach learned from their rock and punk music influences.
<P>
Admission to the Flat Iron show is $8 HFS members, $10 general; concert starts at 8 pm.
<P>
(2)  Mike Dowling House Concert - Thursday, Jan 22nd
<P>
This is your chance to see and hear the amazing Mike Dowling in an intimate setting. Mike is one of the true gentleman masters of the guitar, comfortable with swing, blues, and country, to name a few genres, and will grace us with a wide variety of musical treats.
<P>
Mike won a Grammy as one of twelve finger-picking artists playing Henry Mancini tunes in 2005. He has been a featured guest on Prairie Home Companion, and joined the Guys All Star Shoe band as guest guitarist. Mike also spent a few years in Nashville as a session guitarist and songwriter, and his songs have been recorded by Emmy Lou Harris, Kathy Mattea and Del McCoury.
<P>
When the late great Vassar Clements heard Mike play guitar back in 1975 he did the sensible thing. He hired him. Mike was the guitarist in Vassar's first touring band and Clements called him simply, "One of the finest guitarists there is, anywhere." Mike, who teaches as well as he plays, performs throughout the world and is a popular swing and blues guitar instructor at music camps throughout the country, including the California Coast Music Camp. Don't miss this opportunity to see and hear a true master of American roots guitar.  Check out his website - http://www.mikedowling.com

<P>
Hi Sarah
<P>
I can't seem to find the link for reader comments for the Talk Back section of the magazine so I'm writing you. I give you permission to print any part of this letter.
<P>
There is some needed discussion about the loudness wars on the Dec 2008 issue of Mix (Nashville Skyline, December 2008, The Limits of Compression) but I'm not reading solutions. I'd like to read an article with some actual tips on how to find a happy medium between a dynamically rangeful, and competitively volumous master recording. I wish this war volume never started! The fact remains that as a producer of TV and Radio spots I don't want to fall too far out of the spectrum, yet I don't want flat sounding recordings. I was thinking of average volume. In Wavelab there is an analyze function that can tell you the average volume of an audio file. I have heard that many are shooting for an average of -12 or -11db for popular music and that just sounds too squished to me. I have been compromising and going for -14db which seems to translate over the air OK. The fact is I have no reference for this. I'm just guessing. There are articles complaining about loudness, but no hard data  going into what the analyzed volume of a well mastered track should be, or what the standard is at this time (even if it's way too loud). Also I don't know what exactly happens to a file when it gets played on the air whether on radio or TV. Should we keep levels very mellow and let the station's limiters/maximizers do the work? It's confusing to say the least. We need to start setting the quality standard if nobody else will.
<P>
To sum it up, I'd like some recipes for mastering levels to be used on CD, Radio, and TV. I know there are no hard and fast rules, but some general concepts and perceived volume levels would be a good starting point to maybe begin the deescalation of this terrible war. I'm not saying we need a timeline, but we need to begin talks now.<P>

Thank you.

PS: To Peter Cooper: Two artists I wish had louder recordings are Rickie Lee Jones and Paul Simon. Theyn are the only ones that make me have to turn up my iPod during shuffle play. I hear Rickie has a "No Compressors!" rule in her sessions, and Paul Simon's "Rhythm of the Saints" is one of my all time favorites. In a perfect world everyone would turn down to match the dynamic range and sonic beauty of these artists.

Darol Anger raves about the band -- "The Bee Eaters are the instrumental cream of the brand new string nation. Harking back to the "grand old days" when new virtuosos seemed to spring onto the scene fully formed with a whole repertoire of brilliant music nobody had ever heard before, somehow these kids have absorbed everything we had to offer and alchemized it into a whole new musical world."

(3)  Joe Craven Benefit Concert and Used Instrument Drive<P>

Redwood Coast Music Festivals (parent of The Redwood Coast Jazz Festival and Blues by the Bay) and KWPT 100.3 and 102.7 FM 'The Point' are partnering for a spring instrument drive to benefit local schools.  You can get involved in three ways - (a) attend the benefit concert this Saturday, January 31st, with the phenomenal Joe Craven, (b) donate a used instrument that you no longer need, and/or (c) send a donation check to the RCMF Wish List Fund!
<P>
School music budgets have been dramatically reduced; many now rely heavily on parent support and fundraising to maintain any in-school musical experience.  The RCMF recently interviewed twenty local music teachers to ascertain their greatest needs - which included everything from sheet music and music stands, to orchestral and band instruments and accessories, Macbooks and computer music programs, and travel funds for local and regional concerts.  They have established a Wish List Fund to bolster these school music programs.
<P>
Ways you can contribute to the RCMF Wish List program:
<P>
(a)  Joe Craven Concert -  Multi-instrumentalist Joe Craven will perform on Saturday, January 31st at the Eureka High School Auditorium.  McKinleyville High School's Steel Drum Ensemble will open at 7 pm; doors are at 6:30 pm. Admission is $20 for adults, and $5 for youth 18 and under.  Advanced tickets are available at the Jazz Office (523 5th St, Eureka).  Proceeds will go to the RCMF Wish List Fund and for instrument repair.
<P>
(b)  Used Instrument Drive - Between January 20th and February 13th, drop off your used instruments at The Jazz Office, Arcata and Eureka Co-Ops, the Fortuna Music Mart, or any local branch of Umpqua Bank.  Instruments collected will be donated to local school music programs.
<P>
(c)  Checks for the Wish List fund can be made out to RCMF Music Wish List and sent to the Jazz Office, 523 5th Street, Eureka 95501.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

On Friday, April 10, CenterArts will present a special recital with Yuja Wang at 8pm in HSUs Fulkerson Recital Hall.  A fast-rising star in the classical music world, Yuja Wang is widely recognized as one of the most exciting, young pianists to arrive on the scene. Tickets are $25 general, $22 Senior/Child and $15 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.
<P>
At age 21, Yuja Wang has already established herself as one of the most significant pianists of her generation.  She first came to international recognition in February 2005 when, on one days notice, she replaced Radu Lupu with the National Arts Centre Orchestra where Pinchas Zukerman was conducting and performed Beethoven's Concerto No. 4.   The success was immediate and dramatic with the Canada press reporting "a star is born."  Yuja was immediately reengaged to perform Chopin's Concerto No. 1 in June and has been invited back every season since.   
Yuja made her debuts with the New York Philharmonic, the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Japan and the Chicago, Houston and San Francisco symphonies in the 2006-07 season. She first performed with the New York Philharmonic at the Vail Festival in July 2006 and then again joined the orchestra in Tokyo, with Lorin Maazel conducting, and performed the Liszt Concerto No. 1.  In September, she performed Ravel's G Major Concerto with the San Francisco Symphony, Michael Tilson Thomas conducting, and returned in the spring to perform Beethoven Concerto No. 2 with Charles Dutoit.  Yuja collaborated further with Dutoit at the Chicago and NHK symphonies where she made her debuts performing Prokofiev's Concerto No. 2. In March 2007, Yuja's career made another major advancement when she replaced Martha Argrich playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  <P>

Born in Beijing in 1987, Yuja was drawn to the piano at the age of six when she began studying with Professors Ling Yuan and Zhou Guangren.  She moved to the United States at age 15 upon her acceptance into Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music.  In 2006 Yuja received the prestigious Gilmore Young Artist Award.

By all accounts the Seattle based Fleet Foxes have had an incredible year. The band released their self titled debut record on the ultra hip record label Sub Pop, they performed on Saturday Night Live, and they were picked by the British music magazine Mojo as the number one record of the year! Dont miss your chance to catch this band before they are too big for Arcata! Tickets are $25 general and $20 HSU students. Tickets are available at the Works in Arcata and Eureka, University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.
<P>
Aja Pecknold (the brother of Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold) wrote that the first time I heard Boots of Spanish Leather, it was as if all of the oxygen had been drained from the room, suddenly replaced with the wavering golden longing of this one song. Only it wasn't Dylan singing, it was my 14 year-old brother Robin, belting out these heart-worn lyrics as the afternoon spring sunlight streamed through rain-stained windows, illuminating a thousand dust flecks in my cluttered college apartment. Each verse further eclipsed any hint of a self-conscious adolescent, as his fingers moved nimbly over the fretboard. It was the first of many songs I'd hear him master in the short time after our father gave us both acoustic guitars.
<P>
But while I fumbled awkwardly through Heart of Gold and Blackbird, Robin climbed quickly skyward, up past the tree line, where the air was thin, and the expanse before him unfolded, unobstructed. It wasn't long before he was crafting original material of his own, forsaking most other responsibilities in favor of hunkering down with his Martin and his best friend Skye Skjelset.
<P>
As most best friends are, Skye was along for the journey, picking up guitar around the same time, and the two forsaking their sterile suburban surroundings just outside Seattle ate lunch together in the science room, did their best to ignore high school, and immersed themselves in the music collections of their folks and the private world of songwriting in their basements.
<P>
It wasn't until a few years later though, in 2006, when the boys emerged, and began shaking out some of the basement-born tunes live as Fleet Foxes. They created new songs, scrapped the old, then created more and scrapped them too, eventually finding a few that fit just about right, along with some new friends who emerged from Seattle's musical woodwork: keyboardist Casey Westcott (Seldom), drummer Nick Peterson (Headphones, Pedro the Lion) and later, bassist Christian Wargo (Crystal Skulls). From the Fox den, with the help of credit cards, minimum wages, tip money, friends and family, the boys worked, crafting their first demo, and subsequently the Sun Giant EP and the debut full-length album, with family friend (and Pecknold childhood hero) Phil Ek manning the rudder.
<P>
As far as the music Robin puts it best: We aim to be adventurous and true to ourselves and to enjoy our time together the music we make is a reflection of our instincts. To me, the most enjoyable thing in the world is to sing harmony with people, so we do that a bunch. We love acoustic guitars, electric guitars, big rolling tom drums, mandolins, dulcimers, bass guitars, bass pedals, organs, pianos, kotos, and most of all harmony and melody. We've succeeded for ourselves if we've made a song where every instrument is doing something interesting and melodic. We try to draw from the traditions of folk music, pop, choral music and gospel, baroque psychedelic, sacred harp singing, West Coast music, traditional music from Ireland to Japan, and film scores, and are inspired by the music of our friends and contemporaries in the Seattle music family.
<P>
Opening the show is the Portland based band Blitzen Trapper whose demo made a few critics top ten lists last year.

"This five piece has been making serious inroads, garnering rave reviews.Though steeped in traditional bluegrass, the band resonates as much

<P>
Hot Buttered Rum, one of the hardest-working and fastest-rising stars in the musical firmament, has become, over the last five years, a group that is infinitely greater than the sum of its parts. It began with a core of five uniquely talented musicians writing and singing songs on the mountaintops and city streets of Northern California; five musicians who, on the night they realized they loved playing together too much to ever stop, were sipping a warm buttery winter drink from which the group derived its name. Since that fateful night, the organization has steadily expanded to include a rich tapestry of fans, friends and family reaching from coast to coast. 
<P>
In the Fall of 2006, itching to release their first live album featuring the whole band, Hot Buttered Rum announced that it would be recording a handful of shows for official release. Live in the Northeast (released May 2007) beautifully reveals the true core of live Butter: music that is forceful without being flashy, serious without being stuffy, intricate without being inaccessible, and diverse without being distracting. Often described as a rock band playing bluegrass instruments, no prior Butter recording has so perfectly displayed the bands bolder and heavier side. That full sound permeates Live in the Northeast  from the reggae-tinged Return Someday and psychedelica of Desert Rat through definitive covers of the Grateful Deads Cumberland Blues and Leo Sayers Feel Like Dancin  winding the listener through a robust and intense set of acoustic rock. <P>

The widespread appeal of HBRs music stems not only from the bands musical versatility and prolific songwriting, but also from the magnetic chemistry the group creates onstage together. It was this chemistry that drew the group together, and that holds it together still through the rigors of their involved professional life together. It is this chemistry that audiences are consistently drawn to and caught up in, comment on effusively at shows and in online chat groups. It is this chemistry that is propelling the band to ever greater success. <P>

Hot Buttered Rum is just as comfortable plugging in at a large-scale rock festival as it is inviting the audience to enjoy its quieter repertoire at an acoustic folk session. Perhaps this is why the band has enjoyed success at such diverse festivals as the Newport Folk Festival, Bonnaroo, Grey Fox, High Sierra and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. HBR has managed to do all of this without the use of drums, opting instead to channel their music through the guitars, mandolins, fiddles, banjos and string basses of traditional bluegrass. These, along with their occasional flutes, accordions, and other sundry instruments, are amplified with both electric pickups and microphones, giving them the volume and punch to carry through even the largest sound systems. <P>

The band has shared the stage with some of todays most accomplished artists, such as Phil Lesh, Bela Fleck, Ben Harper, Chris Thile, Mike Marshall and Peter Rowan, the last two of whom worked with the band on its recent critically-acclaimed studio release, Well-Oiled Machine. The support and encouragement the band receives from these and other musical elders is important, since HBR has such a great love and respect for American musical traditions, as well as those from Africa and Europe. Blues, folk, bluegrass, jazz, and rock permeate the groups performances, while the members varying degrees of classical training lead them to invest heavily in group composition. One of the things the band enjoys most is its ability to turn on a dime and leave its audience wondering what new realms their songs will explore, while at the same time assuring them that, above all, the musics purpose is not to impress but to entertain and to inspire. 
<P>
HBR is committed to achieving its musical goals in an environmentally sensitive manner. Since 2003, the band has toured in vehicles that run on vegetable oil and biodiesel instead of fossil fuel products. Doing this has not been easy, especially in the early days. But, being in a business that requires driving thousands of miles each year, HBR knows that using alternative fuel is one of the most effective ways it can reduce its ecological footprint. The band enjoys performing for educational assemblies and benefit concerts, and many of their songs seek to raise awareness about the socially and environmentally volatile era in which we live. Above all, HBRs goal is to satisfy their audiences minds, hearts and dancing feet with a unique and uplifting blend of progressive American music.

<P>


Zepparella is four women intent on bringing the passion, the beauty, the aggression, the musicality of Led Zeppelin alive. Zepparella is no costumed, wigged-up tribute band. You'll hear no backing tracks or misguided attempts at note for note replication. Instead Zepparella offers four seriously talented musicians who have loved and studied this music long enough to make it a part of themselves. It is a celebration of some of the greatest music ever written, by women who love it as musicians and as fans. We who want to celebrate it with you, fellow appreciators. 
<P>
Four women intent on bringing the passion, the beauty, the aggression, keeping the musicality of Led Zeppelin alive. 
<P>
Zepparella delivers an explosive, emotional musical journey at every event. They take on the challenge of balancing their devotion to playing the songs as close to the original as possible, while taking advantage of their own musical communication and carrying the audience away on the ride.
<P>
Individuals with widely diverse musical tastes, Led Zeppelins music is common ground. The magic of Zeppelin was the dynamic energy between the four musicians, and the songs allow Zepparella to feel that energy too.The combination of personalities in Zepparella is something extraordinary. From the first time on stage there was such a strong musical connection that to the girls it felt like a homecoming. And in a musical career, that kind of connection may be the most elusive gift of all.
<P>
The players:
<P>
Anna Kristina, the popular Bay Area stage actress, vocalist, songwriter and solo artist, brings her seductive style and powerful range to front the band with consistently transcendent performances. Her soulful delivery is mesmerizing. 
<P>
Gretchen Menn applies her dazzling and emotive guitar playing to the leads. After her stint as Agnes Young in the top-grossing Bay Area band AC/DShe for three years, and then touring as the second guitarist in the national metal band BOTTOM, she now takes on the Page lines with an arresting ability that cant be missed. 
<P>
Nila Minnerocks seminal bass playing, dark, beautiful, aggressive, melodic, fills out the bottom end of the band. Her joined-at-the-hip connection with Clementine began eleven years ago in BOTTOM, and close to 20 trips around the US, Canada and Europe and three records have created the remarkably intuitive rhythm section that Zeppelin deserves. 
<P>
Clementine tackles the best rock drumming ever written with her own powerfully passionate style, bringing the Motown influence of the Bonham groove to the forefront. As Phyllis Rudd in AC/DShe and throughout the run of BOTTOM, she developed a heavy-hitting sound suited to attempt Zeppelin. The musical connection established with Gretchen in AC/DShe and the lifelong rhythmic conversation with Nila creates the bond required to do this great music justice.

"Karl Denson's Tiny Universe proved that they are a funk powerhouse with a huge sound and super-tight grooves. Their performance was one of the most enjoyable shows that I have seen in some time."  - Richard Clarke (jambase)

<P>


Karl Denson's Tiny Universe has been expanding listeners' minds and making them move to animated grooves since 1998. Led by former Lenny Kravitz sax-man Karl Denson, the Tiny Universe brings a dynamic sound that defies categorization. The band members,have earned a reputation as kings of the unstoppable all-night show. 
<P>
2002 saw the release of the accessible, deeply-grooving album The Bridge, so far the only recording by the current incarnation of the Tiny Universe. A multigenre mix of music, the album earned immense critical praise. While some bands become trapped by the expectations of their fan base, The Bridge is evidence that KDTU refuses to be pinned down. The albums tracks range from the danceable R&B-flavor of originals 'Because Of Her Beauty' and 'The Answer,' that hint at lessons learned from the funk school of James Brown, to the afrobeat and spoken word passages of the Fela Kuti tribute 'Freedom' to the slightly psychedelic treatment of Curtis Mayfield's 'Check Out Your Mind.' 
<P>
The Group Denson has built a reputation as a groundbreaking musician equally potent as a masterful collaborator and an innovative solo artist, following in the footsteps of funkmasters Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley. From the beginning of his musical education, the California native filtered both the funk and soul of Motown and Stax with the deep searching of jazzmen like Yusef Lateef, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and, of course, John Coltrane. 
<P>
Beginning in 1989, Denson spent four years recording and touring with Kravitz during the rock star's most liberated period of music-making, the Let Love Rule and Mama Said albums of the early 90s. During this same period, Denson and DJ Greyboy's 'Unwind Your Mind' collaboration became the top dance track in Europe. <P>

1992 brought the beginning of his solo career. Recruited by German jazz label Minor Music, Karl spent the next four years recording four acoustic jazz albums: Blackened Red Snapper, Herbal Turkey Breast, Chunky Pecan Pie and Baby Food. These recordings showcased Karl's prowess as a composer as well as jazz saxophonist. During this time he also became labelmate to former James Brown hornmen Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker. From 1992-1994, during an extremely busy two year stint, Karl recorded and toured with his own quintet, as well as Lenny Kravitz and Fred Wesley. In 1994 Karl left the Lenny Kravitz band in order to devote full energy to his own vision. The Greyboy Allstars were created and quickly became synonymous with the term groove or acid jazz. Inspired by a love of jazz music and dance music the band defied the odds by becoming one of the largest drawing club acts in the country. The group could be characterized as a 'true jazz band with a ryhthm to keep you dancing'. Denson's drive to continually innovate and push the musical envelope drove him to form the Tiny Universe, and the band is currently touring and writing material for their next release.

The Quartet has performed on four continents and released numerous recordings, including an acclaimed nine-CD set of the Beethoven cycle on the Arte Nova label. Tickets are $45 general, $40 Senior/Child and $25 HSU students. Tickets are available at the Works in Arcata and Eureka, University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu.
<P>
Having celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2006, The Alexander String Quartet are  Zakarias Grafilo, violin; Frederick Lifsitz, violin; Paul Yarbrough, violin and Sandy Wilson, cello. The quartet have performed in the major music capitals of four continents, securing its standing among the worlds premier ensembles.  Widely admired for its interpretations of Beethoven, Mozart, and Shostakovich, the quartet has also established itself as an important advocate of new music through over 25 commissions and numerous premiere performances.  In 1999 BMG Classics released the Quartets nine-CD set of the Beethoven cycle on its Arte Nova label to tremendous critical acclaim.  A new recording of the Beethoven cycle will follow later this year.  The Alexander String Quartet is a major artistic presence in its home base of San Francisco, serving there as directors of the Morrison Chamber Music Center at the School of Music and Dance in the College of Creative Arts at San Francisco State University and Ensemble in Residence of San Francisco Performances.
<P>
The Alexander String Quartets annual calendar of concerts includes engagements at major halls throughout North America and Europe.  The Quartet has appeared at Lincoln Center in New York City, Jordan Hall in Boston, the Library of Congress and chamber music societies and universities across the North American continent.  Recent overseas tours have brought them to the U.K., the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, France, Greece, Argentina and the Philippines.  The many distinguished artists to collaborate with the Alexander String Quartet include pianist Menahem Pressler, clarinetist Eli Eban, cellists Lynn Harrell, soprano Elly Ameling and saxophonists Branford Marsalis.
<P>

The Alexander String Quartet was formed in New York City in 1981 and the following year became the first string quartet to win the Concert Artists Guild Competition.  In 1985, the Quartet captured international attention as the first and only American Quartet to win the London International String Quartet Competition, receiving both the jurys highest award and the Audience Prize.  In May of 1995, Allegheny College awarded Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degrees to the members of the Quartet in recognition of their unique contribution to the arts.  Honorary degrees were conferred on the ensemble by St. Lawrence University in May 2000.
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that They were, to put it simply, terrific of tone, virtuosity and balance. The quality level, as well the particulars of communicative virtuosity, place the Alexander Quartet right up there with the best on todays international scene.

DARK STAR ORCHESTRA PAINTS A MUSICAL MASTERPIECE OF GRATEFUL DEAD MEMORIES AT THE EUREKA THEATER  MONDAY APRIL 20th<P>



" What impresses me most about DSO is how close they come to capturing the vibe, the emotional atmosphere, of what the Grateful Dead used to do.... A sold out run in San Francisco and many other towns around the country says I'm not alone in feeling there's something special to this tribute. They highlight and expand upon the glories of days past, and in this way, build a future for the music."- Dennis Cook (Jambase)

<P>


Each night, the Chicago-based band decides on performing one show from the 2,500 that the Grateful Dead performed during their 30 year tenure as fathers of improvisational rock. As a chamber orchestra interprets Bach or Mozart, Dark Star Orchestra presents the complete original set list, song by song, and in order, recreating historic music with uncanny faithful interpretation. 
<P>
DSO is drawing national attention with their true-to-life performances. Rolling Stone praises Dark Star Orchestra's fanatical attention to detail. USA Today says DSO is channeling the Dead and the Washington Post declares them the hottest Grateful Dead tribute act going. Dallas Morning News affirms DSO is the next best thing to being there, the Denver Post describes Dark Star Orchestra as a perfection-oriented practitioner of homage and the Associated Press notes that DSO takes its act to a level of detail that befits a rock band famous for its fanatical following. 
<P>
The group has its craft so well-refined that even members of the Grateful Dead themselves, rhythm guitarist/singer Bob Weir, drummer Bill Kreutzmann, vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux, and keyboardists Vince Welnick and Tom Constanten, have appeared on stage and performed with these live music interpreters. The group recently performed their 1600th show and recently released a three disc set of a special 30th anniversary recreation of the infamous 5/8/77 show from Ithaca, NY. 
<P>
Precision is king with this group, which position the stage plot based on the year of Grateful Dead show to be performed. Dark Star Orchestra adapts their phrasing, voice arrangements, and even arranges specific musical equipment for the various eras in which they perform. At the end of every performance, the band announces the date and venue where the original show just covered took place. Dark Star Orchestra dips into every incarnation of the Dead, so most fans can see shows that happened long before they were born. 
<P>
Were given a canvas with a boundary, whatever the stage set up is the framework and all of the painting that we do within that framework is unique to us, says rhythm guitarist/vocalist Rob Eaton. So we offer the sound and the structure, but all the stroking and painting is all us. So its fresh at the same time and also historically correct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND brings their foot stomping jamgrass good times to the Eureka Theater Thursday April 16th.


<P>
" They are playing incredible music but they got some fresh approach to bluegrass music that transcends something. I have seen a ton of great bluegrass bands and I cant tell you I think they are any better than any of them."- Craig Ferguson (Telluride Bluegrass Festival)

<P>

Colarado's YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND, known for its high-energy, improvisational live shows has just released (April 15, 2008) a new live album on the band's own Frog Pad Records.  This marks the 5th volume in their lauded series of live albums, Mountain Tracks.  Blending bluegrass and rock with traditional instrumentation (guitar, bass, mandolin and banjo), YONDER has pioneered a sound that is their own over the past ten years as a band. 
Yonder (Adam Aijala-guitar, Jeff Austin-mandolin, Dave Johnston-banjo and Ben Kaufmann-bass) first came together in September 1998 over a growing love for bluegrass that quite unexpectedly brought the four players together during a free-for-all jam session at The Verve, a bar outside of Boulder, in 1998.  Once they met, they knew they were onto something. "It was an eye-opening experience because we heard a unique sound," says Johnston. "Something coalesced that night." <P>

Emphasizing song craft and unafraid to push its boundaries, things began snowballing quickly. In 1999, the band debuted with Elevation, produced by Grammy-winning dobro player Sally Van Meter and released (like each of its ensuing studio discs) on their own Frog Pad Records. Yonder Mountain returned in 2001 with Town by Town, helmed by Grammy Award winning songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Tim O'Brien.  Van Meter was back behind the boards for the 2003 set Old Hands, a concept album of sorts that featured the songwriting of Benny "Burle" Galloway.  Featured on the evocative tunes about cowboys, miners and all sorts of hard-livin' Western folk were O'Brien, lauded fiddleman Darol Anger (Bela Fleck, David Grisman Quintet, Vassar Clements) and dobro player Jerry Douglas (Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris).  In between those studio discs, the band released Mountain Tracks Volume 1-IV, issued on Frog Pad Records, and each capturing the energy of its increasingly popular live shows.  Their last studio release, "Yonder Mountain String Band" was produced by rock producer Tom Rothrock (Foo Fighters, Elliot Smith, Beck) creating a sound for the band that continues to close the gap between bluegrass and rock.  It's an album that "represents us more than any other record we've done," states Aijala, "because it incorporates more of our musical influences than ever before. It's a really cool thing to be a part of and I'll never take for granted just how lucky we are to do what we do. It makes me more excited for the future."

 <P>

With little radio support, Yonder Mountain has become one of the fastest rising touring bands in the country, its fanbase having ballooned over the past five years through steady gigging and high-profile festival sets, all of which are full of improv and none of which feature the same set list. "Now that we're maturing as performers, our improvisation is more beholden to playing with good tone, good feel, good timing," says Johnston. 
<P>
 

It can't be understated just what the band has achieved with that untraditional banjo/bass/mandolin/guitar line-up. Using bluegrass as its bedrock, the band has grown like few rock bands even do these days. "It's funny," says Austin. "But now we're selling out Red Rocks in Denver, just 40 miles from where we became a band."  Yonder will return to Red Rocks August 2nd after last year's triumphant sold-out show.   This summer will be a big year for the band with a co-headline tour with longtime collaborator Keller Williams, lots of festivals (Bonnaroo, Rothbury, Telluride Bluegrass, the band's own North West String Summit), and ending the summer with a hometown show at Red Rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<P>
" Greene's songs span the basest impulses of lust and revenge to the noblest spiritual aspirations, everything that defines what it means to be human. " - Randy Lewis (LA Times)


<P>

Many people have already made up their minds about Jackie Greene, the Americana phenom from Sacramento who made his first album only six years ago and has steadily built up a passionate following among both rank-and-file fans and some of the biggest names in music. Tours with a whos-who of American roots music - Buddy Guy, Elvis Costello, Susan Tedeschi, Willie Nelson, B.B. King and Ramblin Jack Elliott among them  and performances everywhere from the Newport Folk Festival and the Monterey Jazz Festival to Bonnaroo, have meant that Greene was recognized quickly by those who know talent, and who saw something rare and promising in him. Their early enthusiasm has only grown with each new album. 
<P>
Nevertheless, Greene himself is less and less keen on defining himself in a world that wants him to be its latest New Dylan. Instead, 27-year-old Greene is thinking big - about death or, more accurately, transformation. He named his new, game-changing album Giving Up the Ghost for a reason. The phrase refers to the destruction of certain notions and practices that I used to hold in high esteem, he says. Im just sorta sick of being the kid with the harmonica rack. I dont want to be Bob Dylan. 
<P>
Who Jackie Greene actually is becomes much clearer with Giving Up the Ghost. The album opens with the sweeping, richly-orchestrated Shaken, the albums first single, which eschews the clean lines and familiar roots sound of his past. With a deliberative pace and washes of strings and synths, blessed with a memorable melodic hook, Shaken is a statement of renewed purpose  even though Greene is vague about what that purpose might be. 
<P>
And as he prepares his band to head out for another year of serious touring, Greene is giving himself and his band the same sort of license he gave himself as a songwriter. The recording is the recording, and the live show is the live show, and in my mind thats different, it sounds way different, and thats good, he says. Live is still the best way to experience music, because its pretty pure. If you want to hear something the same way over and over, you can listen to the record, but if you want to hear the song, you go hear it live. You might get a fucked-up version of the song, I might play it on the piano instead, and it might not work, but thats just how it goes. 
<P>
Greene is just as philosophical about his commercial fate as the release of his fifth album looms and the pressure grows for him to sell the large numbers of records his enormous talent clearly warrants. 
<P>
I dont know where everyone else gets that from, he says. I dont feel that pressure. Ive stopped feeling pressured about anything, because I realized that when everyone says, This is it, its going to go big, and then it doesnt, you let yourself down. Ive stopped giving a shit about that. It makes me feel better about me. If this record totally flops, Ill just make another one. Im attached to em, I created em, but the commercial thing isnt a reflection on my art or anything else. Its its own thing. Thus freed from some of the musical, lyrical and commercial constraints he had once put on himself, Jackie Greene is pushing forward into new territory, and with Giving Up the Ghost, he is expanding his own, and others notion of who he is. The new album features the sounds of a talented youngster giving himself some room to move, to explore new textures, surprising chord changes, and other characters that may or may not be him. Ultimately, he says, My hope is that these songs will someday ignore their creator and tell their tales all by themselves.

" They are playing incredible music but they got some fresh approach to bluegrass music that transcends something. I have seen a ton of great bluegrass bands and I cant tell you I think they are any better than any of them."- Craig Ferguson (Telluride Bluegrass Festival)

<P>

Colorado's YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND, known for its high-energy, improvisational live shows has just released (April 15, 2008) a new live album on the band's own Frog Pad Records.  This marks the 5th volume in their lauded series of live albums, Mountain Tracks.  Blending bluegrass and rock with traditional instrumentation (guitar, bass, mandolin and banjo), YONDER has pioneered a sound that is their own over the past ten years as a band. 
Yonder (Adam Aijala-guitar, Jeff Austin-mandolin, Dave Johnston-banjo and Ben Kaufmann-bass) first came together in September 1998 over a growing love for bluegrass that quite unexpectedly brought the four players together during a free-for-all jam session at The Verve, a bar outside of Boulder, in 1998.  Once they met, they knew they were onto something. "It was an eye-opening experience because we heard a unique sound," says Johnston. "Something coalesced that night." 
<P>
Emphasizing song craft and unafraid to push its boundaries, things began snowballing quickly. In 1999, the band debuted with Elevation, produced by Grammy-winning dobro player Sally Van Meter and released (like each of its ensuing studio discs) on their own Frog Pad Records. Yonder Mountain returned in 2001 with Town by Town, helmed by Grammy Award winning songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Tim O'Brien.  Van Meter was back behind the boards for the 2003 set Old Hands, a concept album of sorts that featured the songwriting of Benny "Burle" Galloway.  Featured on the evocative tunes about cowboys, miners and all sorts of hard-livin' Western folk were O'Brien, lauded fiddleman Darol Anger (Bela Fleck, David Grisman Quintet, Vassar Clements) and dobro player Jerry Douglas (Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris).  In between those studio discs, the band released Mountain Tracks Volume 1-IV, issued on Frog Pad Records, and each capturing the energy of its increasingly popular live shows.  Their last studio release, "Yonder Mountain String Band" was produced by rock producer Tom Rothrock (Foo Fighters, Elliot Smith, Beck) creating a sound for the band that continues to close the gap between bluegrass and rock.  It's an album that "represents us more than any other record we've done," states Aijala, "because it incorporates more of our musical influences than ever before. It's a really cool thing to be a part of and I'll never take for granted just how lucky we are to do what we do. It makes me more excited for the future."

 <P>

With little radio support, Yonder Mountain has become one of the fastest rising touring bands in the country, its fanbase having ballooned over the past five years through steady gigging and high-profile festival sets, all of which are full of improv and none of which feature the same set list. "Now that we're maturing as performers, our improvisation is more beholden to playing with good tone, good feel, good timing," says Johnston. 

 
<P>
It can't be understated just what the band has achieved with that untraditional banjo/bass/mandolin/guitar line-up. Using bluegrass as its bedrock, the band has grown like few rock bands even do these days. "It's funny," says Austin. "But now we're selling out Red Rocks in Denver, just 40 miles from where we became a band."  Yonder will return to Red Rocks August 2nd after last year's triumphant sold-out show.   This summer will be a big year for the band with a co-headline tour with longtime collaborator Keller Williams, lots of festivals (Bonnaroo, Rothbury, Telluride Bluegrass, the band's own North West String Summit), and ending the summer with a hometown show at Red Rocks.

<P>
SAM BUSH:
<P>
Though he admits a certain discomfort with the moniker "King of Newgrass," Sam Bush has more than earned it. As cofounder and leader of the seminal progressive bluegrass band New Grass Revival through 18 years during the 1970s and '80s, Bush may not be the only person responsible for newgrass, the wild bluegrass stepchild that features rock 'n' roll grooves and extended virtuosic jams, but since New Grass Revival's dissolution in 1989, Bush has certainly been one of the most brilliant of newgrass's many bright lights. 
<P>
Besides helming the ever-popular Sam Bush Band, featured on the upcoming release Laps in Seven, the mandolin prodigy from Kentucky has been a prodigious influence on musicians young and old. Bands like Nickel Creek, Yonder Mountain String Band, and String Cheese Incident, to name just a few, are indebted to Bush's example, not only in his wide-ranging choice of material and rock-based acoustic grooves, but by his captivating, high-energy live shows, which have made him an in demand headliner, and fan fave at important festivals like Telluride and MerleFest. <P>

When not heading his own band, Bush has spent the past 15 years as a supersideman with the likes of Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, and the Flecktones; spearheaded boundary-stretching collaborations with Edgar Meyer, Mark O'Connor, and David Grisman, and driven nearly every "bluegrass supergroup" imaginable with his inimitable mandolin playing 
<P>

Sam Bush's ability to be continually touched and amazed by new music may be the quality that makes him such a successful and virtuosic performer and band leader. He helped create newgrass music almost 35 years ago, but Laps in Seven is evidence that he's still as vital a presence on the acoustic music scene as ever: still making new sounds, still rockin' out on great songs, and still pushing the bar higher for the legions of his proteges, fans and friends.

<P>
Most musicians have so many ups and downs in their careers it often seems as if they survive purely by the seat of their pants. While Afroman's actions over the years haven't been quite so impulsive, his start in the industry came about as a direct result of an unfortunate schoolyard incident involving, believe it or not, the low-riding seat of his pants.
<P>
"The first tape I made was about my eighth-grade teacher," recalls the 30-year-old rapper, whose real name is Joseph Foreman. "She got me kicked out of school for sagging my pants, which was a big deal back then. So I wrote this song about her and it sold about 400 copies: it was selling to teachers, students, just about everybody. And I realized that, even though I wasn't at school, my song was at school, so in a way I was still there. All these people would come by my house just to give me comments about how cool they thought the song was."
<P>
That episode was precisely the proverbial 'kick in the pants' Afroman needed to satisfy his burgeoning musical aspirations. Using a low-cost microphone, tape deck and mixer -- purchased by his parents to "keep him out of trouble" -- the novice rapper went from ragging on his teacher to crafting spirited tapes filled with his patented mixture of perceptive humor and straight-from-the-street sentiments.
<P>
"I'd hustle to all the swap meets in LA until security ran me out," he remembers adding that he initially lived in the infamous South Central section of Los Angeles before moving, as a teenager, to Palmdale, California. "I also went to all the low-rider shows and Venice Beach. Basically, any function where I thought I could flip over a dollar and expose people to my music."
<P>
That hustling ultimately paid off when "Because I Got High" from THE GOOD TIMES, his debut full-length CD, became the most popular summer song of 2001. A hilarious ode to the pitfalls of smoking marijuana, the track was a Top Ten tune in over a dozen countries, with the album certified gold in the United States.

"Darol Anger is the sort of musician who refuses to concede that musical boundaries even exist. Surrounding himself with musicians of the absolute top rank, Anger has upped the ante of string-band music almost off the charts."-Amazon.com 
 


<P>
&An all-star band spiralling up out of the rich caffeinated brew that is the music community of Portland, Oregon. Too famous to be local but residents just the same, Portland's very own all-star team of nationally-known talent has coalesced as Strings For Industry. 
Musical legends Darol Anger (violin) and Carlton Jackson (percussion) team with acknowledged monsters Scott Law (guitar) and Tye North (bass), deliver a musical experience embracing the length, breadth and depth of American Music. 
In the great tradition of groups like The Band and NRBQ, this band covers it all with their original songs and re-imagining of classics. 
<P>
Singer-songwriter-instrumentalist SCOTT LAWs fiery guitar and mandolin playing compliment soulful singing and a book of songs from punkfunk-jazz to three-chord Americana. A lifelong improviser who thrives on live performance, Scott is as comfortable in an intimate acoustic setting as with a highly energized electro-psychedelic-blues-rock raging freakout. He has worked with Phil Lesh, Bill Nershi (Honkytonk Homeslice), Hanuman, Melvin Seals, his own group (Scott Law Band) and The Piano Throwers among others. 
<P>
The LA Times has described CARLTON JACKSON's drumming as being intensely musical. This phrase also perfectly describes Carlton, a nationally known first call musician in the industry. His incisive style & mastery of various music genres has made him a natural choice for his work in live performance, feature films, television and radio. Carlton has worked with jazz greats Tom Grant, Leroy Vinnegar, Billy Eckstine, Bo Diddley, Jerry Hahn, Maryann Price, Mark Isham, Jim Pepper, Bobby Torres, James Cotton, Houston Person, actor Bruce Willis, Dianne Schuur, Larry Coryell, Danny Barnes, Bill Frisell, and Gordon Lee. Carlton has also worked under the batons of conductors Pete Rugolo, Norman Leyden and James DePreist. Dan Balmer and Terry Robb, Blues/R&B singers D.K.Stewart and Curtis Salgado, country-pop singer Toni Land and iconoclastic composer Jon Newton, have also engaged his musical services. 
<P>
A native of Portland, Oregon, bassist TYE NORTH toured all over the US with Leftover Salmon for 7 years. He recording three records with them, featuring guests Bela Fleck, Waylon Jennings, Earl Scruggs, and Lucinda Williams. Tye has performed and collaborated with Victor Wooten, Paul Mccandless, Mike Kang, Sam Bush, Karl Denson, Robert Walter, Jessica Lurie, Darol Anger, Taj Mahal, Future Man, Wally Ingram, Jeff Coffin, and Bruce Hampton. He has taken part in and promoted concerts for the Annual Zambiland Orchestra, held by beloved drummer Jeff Sipe. He recorded and toured with the group Comotion, featuring Mike Kang, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Paul McCandless, Jeff Sipe, and Aaron Johnston. 
<P>
Violinist, fiddler, composer, producer and educator, DAROL ANGER is at home in a number of musical genres, some of which he helped to invent. He developed his signature sound through working with many of the worlds great improvising string musicians, among them Stephane Grappelli, Mark OConnor, Bela Fleck, Tony Rice, David Grisman and Vassar Clements. <P>
His current group, The Republic Of Strings, breaks new territory for bowed string instruments and presents young talent. With the jazz-oriented Turtle Island String Quartet, Anger developed and popularized new techniques for playing contemporary music on string instruments. His groups The Republic of Strings, The Fiddlers 4, Psychograss, and the Anger-Marshall Duo feature his compositions and arrangements. His group Montreux was the original musical model for the New Adult Contemporary radio format. The David Grisman Quintet forged a new genre of acoustic string band music with Darols fertile inventiveness, surprising touches and technical mastery often in the forefront. Anger has produced dozens of critically lauded recordings since 1977 which have featured his compositions and performances.

<P>
About Bill... At 101 years young, there's no doubt that Bill Tapia is in a class by himself. Not only is he still playing, touring and recording, his chops, wit and showmanship remain top notch. Having purchased his first instrument at age 7 from one of Hawai'i's original ukulele makers, Tapia represents the last living link to the earliest days of Hawaiian music as we know it today.
<P>
Abandoning the uke for guitar, Tapia's youth was spent performing and jamming with the top names of the day, including Charlie Barnet, Billy Holiday, Fats Waller, Bing Crosby and many more. While in Hawai'i he led his own big band and also worked with Island luminaries like Sol Hoopi'i and Johnny Noble. After World War II, Tapia and family settled in the San Francisco area, where he taught guitar in obscurity for decades.
<P>
Bill picked up the uke again a few years ago. Since then, he's hit the Top 10 on the jazz chart twice while touring the West Coast between frequent trips to perform in the Aloha State, where he now has a second home. The "Duke of the 'Uke" is a consummate showman and charismatic raconteur, sharing his living history of jazz, ukulele and the Islands in every performance.
<P>
In 2004, Bill Tapia was inducted into the Ukulele Hall of Fame, and his colorful life was recently documented in "To You Sweetheart, Aloha" - which premiered at the Hawaii International Film Festival. <P>

Rolling Stone's David Fricke states, "The Mermen play an extreme brand of surf music; the trebly turbulent and black minor chord moods of guitarist Jim Thomas are like a rough ride on the icy seas of the mid-Atlantic," the Village Voice states, "Amazing, cascading waves of dreamlike sound," and Guitar Player Magazine calls Thomas's guitar playing, "Liquid poetry." The LA Times says the Mermen's music "`refuses to be pigeonholed by soaring in all directions--from pretty, atmospheric psychedelia to electrifying Hendrix-esque soloing to punchy punk inspired riffing." But, to their diehard fan base, The Mermen's melodic, hook-laden and evocative music saturates the soul with the California spirit, experience and emotion that transcends the instrumental surf-guitar rock/jam-band genre. 
Songwriter and guitarist Jim Thomas channels the Golden State's sun-drenched, surf and sand coastal lifestyle love affair with sound and tone as drastic and dynamic as the icy San Francisco Ocean Beach surf one second, to the warmth of a San Diego Sunset and beach bonfire the next. 
<P>

California comes alive with an electric vibrancy with every glassine note, crystalline riff, ingenious chord change, frantic, frenetic and flavorful arpeggios, harried hammer-ons, screaming scales and nuanced-to-brilliantly, blunt, and blatant applications of vibrato, reverb and tremolo that leaves the hair on the back of your neck and arms standing straight-up. To say that Thomas approaches his instrument with the fervor and imagination of Dick Dale, humor of Cheap Trick's Rick Neilsen, and the playing skills of Eric Johnson and Stevie Ray Vaughan is a massive understatement. 

<P>
Backed by a rhythm section of bassist Allen Whitman and drummer Martyn Jones, they lay a foundation as thick and tasty as caramel and crème liqueur for Thomas's fretboard pyrotechnics. Not relegated to simply thumping out 1-3-5 root note bass lines along with laisser-faire kick-snare-high-hat drumming - so common of the surf-rock genre - the dynamic duo's innovative and harmonious underpinnings are a fusion of John Paul Jones and John Bonham thunder and Geddy Lee and Neil Peart creativity. 

<P>
The resulting emotional response to The Mermen's music is best described as the exhilaration of being swept weightless at breakneck speed by the surf, spray and wind on the perfect Mavericks tube ride that never ends. 

<P>
Rolling Stone Magazine's David Fricke concludes, "Hints of Dick Dale filter through the cracked sidewalk waveforms of Sonic Youth. Thomas sounds more like Neil Young at the wheel of the good ship Crazy Horse."

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">The Pimps of Joytime bring their afrobeat soul-funk dance party to the Red Fox Tavern Tuesday MAY 13th 


<P>

"The genre-defying Pimps of Joytime pay homage to funk, afrobeat, latin and hip hop, combining loops and live playing in a way that is seamless and infectious. The joyful noise you'll hear is a heady musical gumbo sure to get you moving." 



<P>

The Pimps of Joytime are the ultimate desert island band. PJT's can turn a lifetime in isolation into a party that never ends. This multi-ethnic group hits all the marks and crosses all the barriers, bridging the gap between underground funk, soul, pop, dance, afrobeat and latin, filling every song with soulful harmonies and great vibes. 
<P>
Coming out of Brooklyn & New Orleans, The Pimps of Joytime are definitely the live group to look out for.  Their songs are songs you sing along to, dance to, make a block party to! Band leader, singer, guitarist and producer Brian J comes from a strong musical background and advanced his sound over the past few years to a pure original groove of his own.
<P>
The songs range from heavy New Orleans Funk to Latin Cumbia to Afrobeat Soul, to Ballads and Blues. Backed by a swinging Brazillian groove, "H20" features the vocals of the great Cyril Neville of the Neville Brothers. "Street Sounds" takes you on a soulful dancefloor groove around the various cities where street musicians create the soundscape. "Bonita" is a call to all beautiful Latinas to the dancefloor, and just to surprise you, there's some real heavy funk/ blues tunes such as "My Gold" and "Hey Mr J." They've been very busy touring in SF, LA & their hometowns New Orleans & NYC. The Pimps of Joytime's first album "High Steppin" will surely take you higher!
<P>

Brian J is the band's ringmaster. He started PJT's in Brooklyn back in 2005, where they cut their teeth while playing clubs in Williamsburg and the East Village. On stage, he's the lead singer and guitarist, and in the studio, he's the funkiest one-man-band this side of Minneapolis. <P>

Mixing samples and dance beats with tasty live musicianship and sweet vocal harmonies, The Pimps of Joytime have evolved into the current five-piece that gets crowds on their feet from London to New York to San Francisco. Somehow, PJT's found a way to put a modern twist on a retro sound, creating dirty, ass-shakin' grooves like no one else out there. 
<P>
2008 was a great year for The Pimps of Joytimethey put out two albums on DJ Nickodemus' Wonderwheel Recordings, "High Steppin" and "Funk Fixes and Remixes". 2009 is gonna be even betterwith a new record on the way and a team in place to bring this band to the masses across the USA and beyond.

Roots Reggae pioneers, the Itals along with special guest Joseph Israel, will lay down irie vibes and sweet rhythms at the Red Fox Tavern Tuesday July 14th 


"were still singing about Roots and Culture and Reality...the songs, are beautiful harmonies, beautiful music and nice riddims. You know, my music has always come from the roots - you see, there can never be a branch without the roots... the music I put out is just the music of the inspiration."   - Keith Porter



Long before the Itals were a spark in their producers eye, Keith Porter recorded his first hit single, Hitey Titey, with the Westmorelites on the Studio One label in 1967. Around 1969, Keith became lead singer for a band named Soul Hermit, backed by Eugene Gray and Wignal Henry on guitars, Reginald Seewell/Nash on base and drums. They played in numerous entertainment sectors of Jamaica until Owen Sinclair put together a new band in 1971. Called Future Generation, the band was composed of Dalton James and Roy Hilton on drums, Devon Henry on keyboards, Eugene Gray, guitar, Scott on sax, and Keith on vocals. They performed at many hotels and nightclubs on the tourist circuit of Jamaica for X amount of years, singing all styles of music, American and Jamaican.

Tiring of the club scene around 1975, Keith ran into Ronnie Davis on Orange Street in Kingston and asked him who was auditioning. Ronnie gave him a cassette with a rhythm. I was so happy with that rhythm I didnt look any further, says Keith. In less than a week I had written Ina Dis Ya Time and came back to Kingston to record it for Lloyd Campbells SpiderMan label. Lloyd felt it needed some harmonies with my lead, so Ronnie and I both added harmony parts. There was no intention of forming a group called the Itals; the record first came out as Keith Porter. After the song was on its way to becoming a hit in Jamaica, we all went out to do some promotion. Lloyd, Ronnie, myself and Brian Thomas of RJR were sitting out back in the cantina, when Brian said why not call them the Itals, because now there was more than one person singing. Everyone liked that name. It sounded good, so all of a sudden, Itals was a group. It was never intentional. Ive always wondered if the name was the result of Brian noticing how strict I was about the food I ate, strictly Ital.

Lloyd quickly repressed the record as The Itals to meet demand. Today the song remains The Itals' signature tune, and has been described by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones as the perfect reggae track. It has been included on the Rolling Stones Artist Choice cd, released this year and available through Starbucks Coffee from Hear Music, a division of EMI and in selected major chains.

The success of Ina Dis Ya Time saw the group return to the studio with the addition of Lloyd Ricketts singing the third harmony part on a series of superb recordings for the SpiderMan label. Tunes like Don't Wake The Lion, Brutal, and Temptation followed on 7 release in Jamaica and New York in 77 and 78, establishing the Itals among the best of Jamaica's singers and songwriters. The Itals were twice finalists in the Jamaica Festival Song Competition, and their 1981 tune, Jamaican Style, earned them a place at Reggae Sunsplash that year. 1982 saw the release of the first Itals' album, Brutal Out Deh on Nighthawk Records. The Itals toured the US and Canada backed by the Roots Radics. Their second album, Give Me Power, was released to critical acclaim and hit #1 on CMJ's Reggae Route chart. In 1985, Pollstar Magazine placed them in the top 100 artists of the year.

The Itals' third recording, Rasta Philosophy, won a Grammy nomination for best reggae album, followed by Cool And Dread. Their fifth album, Early Recordings, gathers together all the Itals' early singles and several rare pre-Itals tracks for a collector's feast from Nighthawk. Next came the Rhythm Safari album Easy to Catch, followed by Modern Age on Ras Records, and continuous touring throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Over the years, the Itals have performed countless shows worldwide. Although the harmony singers have sometimes changed, they still sound as sweet as ever, backing the original Itals lead vocalist, Keith Porter. Now, with the release of Mi Livity from the Itals Keith Porter, the Ital tradition continues into the current music scene.

JOSEPH ISRAEL:

Joseph Israel, born Joseph M. Fennel, is one of those unique individuals whose natural talents and spiritual calling have merged into a music that is as thought provoking as it is inspiring. "What I share with my audience is t draw everyone closer to the source of Truth  that we are all brothers and sisters, and that division and lies cannot stand". The name, Israel, is a reflection that defines Joseph's striving for the blessings of the Almighty YHWH (pronounced "Yahweh'). This is the name intended for all peoples, tribes and tongues that love the Most High and love their neighbor. These are the teachings of Rabbi Yahshua of Nazareth the Messiah. We are all one family. 
Joseph is truly blessed to have been surrounded by a deep sense of appreciation for all cultures as a youth. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to Joe and Jean Ann Fennel, Israel was exposed to the works and writings of history makers like Martin Luther King Jr. His father and Uncle were also huge fans of reggae music and traveled often to Jamaica. At age 12 Joseph received his first reggae cassettes  Bob Marley, "Legend", Peter Tosh. "Wanted Dead or Alive, Jimmy Cliff, "Special", Burning Spear, "Markus Garvey. Israel was inspired by their musicianship, but more importantly, by the message. "Their music really inspired me to become who I am. They were speaking about the truth, humanity and about changing things in a positive way. And even when things are tough, we must keep going. So I found a common thread in reggae music that spoke to my heart". 
Naturally, Joseph began writing songs of his own, and formed the reggae band Kepha, (Aramaic for "Rock') which did well regionally. The group recorded "Redemption Time' in Fayetteville, AR. He also started the group Lions of Israel, whose modern day roots rocked the Midwest and beyond from 2002-2005. In 2004 Joseph was invited to open for Ziggy Marley at a sold-out concert in Fayetteville. His acoustic performance was captivating and propelled Joseph closer to the recording of his debut solo album "Gone Are the Days". The album was self-produced and financed, and was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in the heart of Kingston, Jamaica. Its lyrics are of headline-torn news reports, and are a call for spiritual awakening. In 2006 Joseph Israel was signed to New Door Records of Universal Music Group, and in 2007 "Gone Are the Days" reached #11 on the Top Reggae album charts. 
In 2008 Israel released download-only EP "Teach Your Children", Restore Humanity. "It was a lot of fun to make", says Joseph of the sessions. "I was able to record some great songs, while helping to bring awareness to the Restore Humanity organization". Restore Humanity is a 501{c} {3} non-profit charitable outfit founded by Sarah Fennel, Joseph's sister. The program aids and assists the needs of oppressed and poverty-stricken families around the world. 
Joseph Israel has toured the US, rocking and inspiring audiences from coast to coast with his message music. Israel is currently in the studio putting the finishing touches on his second album, to be released in 2009. 
"This music is like a tree planted by the river of water that brings forth fruit in due season  fruits of Joy, Hope, Unity and Healing. I look forward to the day that the Earth weill be restored, no more war, suffering or strife, only LIFE! I realized instead of just talking about these things I could share them through song and really have a positive effect. This message is healing people all over". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><br><div align="center"><img src="News/graphics/837.jpg" alt="THE ITALS  " border="0"></div></font>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Rick Estrin & The Nightcats - Humbrews, 856 10th St, Arcata, 826-2739 -Saturday, June 13  9pm   $15/$20
<p>
One day back in 1970, a 20-year old Rick Estrin had the opportunity to play harmonica with Muddy Waters and his band at the Sutherland Hotel on 47th and Drexel in Chicago's South Side. During the break, Muddy called Estrin over, shook his finger in his face, and shouted, "You outta sight boy! You play like a MAN boy! You got that sound boy, I KNOW that sound when I hear it, that's MY sound!"
<p>
Today, singer/harmonica player/songwriter Rick Estrin ranks among the very best harp players in the blues world. His work on the reeds is at once deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs while at the same time pushing that tradition forward. The Associated Press called his harp playing, "endlessly impressive." The great guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. (who was schooled by Robert Johnson and who played on most of Little Walter's Chess recordings) told Estrin, "Little Walter would be very proud of you."
<p>
For more than 30 years and nine albums, Rick fronted the jumping, swinging Little Charlie & The Nightcats, featuring guitarist Little Charlie Baty. But now, with Baty's recent retirement from touring, Estrin -- along with the Nightcats longtime rhythm section of J. Hansen and Lorenzo Farrell and fiery guitarist Kid Andersen -- is ready to take the lead on his own. Rick Estrin & The Nightcats' sound, while still swinging the blues, is a harmonica-driven, rocking, guitar-fueled rave-up. The band performs the well-known, well-loved songs from Estrin's massive catalog, and will introduce plenty of new material along the way.
<p>
Rick's seemingly effortless command of the harmonica is matched only by his soulful vocals and remarkable original songs. Ever since he started performing his own material, it has become increasingly clear that Rick Estrin is a songwriter of unparalleled skill. His quick wit, coifed hair, pencil-thin mustache and sharp attire inform his songs in a way Cab Calloway, Louis Jordan, Willie Dixon and Elvis Presley would all be proud of. Blues Revue declared, "Estrin sits on one of the finest blues catalogs of any band on the planet. His carefully wrought lyrics penetrate human weakness with the precision of a boxer, though more often than not, he chooses to leave you laughing after the blow's been struck."<p>

His songs have been favorably compared with those of Willie Dixon and the songwriting team of Leiber and Stoller. Estrin won the 1993 Blues Music Award for his composition, My Next Ex-Wife and has written songs for a growing legion of famous fans. Three of his songs found their way onto Grammy-nominated albums: Don't Put Your Hands On Me (from Koko Taylor's Force Of Nature), I'm Just Lucky That Way (from Robert Cray's Shame + A Sin), and Homely Girl (from John Hammond's Trouble No More). Other artists who have covered Estrin songs include Little Milton, Rusty Zinn, Kid Ramos and Mark Hummel. "I like songs that tell stories," Rick says, "songs that are well-crafted and meaningful." Besides Dixon and Leiber and Stoller, Estrin cites Sonny Boy Williamson II, Percy Mayfield and Baby Boy Warren as his major songwriting influences. Billboard noted that Rick writes "fabulous, remarkable original material."

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">CenterArts presents an evening with folk icon Joan Baez on Monday, August 17th at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. From Greenwich Village coffee houses of the 60s to the ever-evolving visions of todays singer songwriters, Joan Baez has profoundly influenced and transformed folk music over the course of three decades. A truly authentic folk legend, she retains an activists heart and an amazing musical voice. Tickets are $45 general, $45 Senior/Child and $25 HSU students. Tickets are available at the University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu (beginning August 3rd). 
<P>

Two-thousand-and-eight was a landmark year for Joan Baez marking 50 years since she began her legendary residency at Bostons famed Club 47. She remains a musical force of nature whose influence is incalculablemarching on the front line of the civil rights movement with Martin Luther King, singing on the first Amnesty International tour and just this year, standing alongside Nelson Mandela when the world celebrated his 90th birthday in Londons Hyde Park. She brought the Free Speech Movement into the spotlight, took to the fields with Cesar Chavez, organized resistance to the war in Southeast Asia, then forty years later saluted the Dixie Chicks for their courage to protest war.  

<P>
Her earliest recordings fed a host of traditional ballads into the rock vernacular before she unselfconsciously introduced Bob Dylan to the world in 1963 and focused awareness on songwriters ranging from Woody Guthrie, Dylan, to Kris Kristofferson, Dar Williams, Steve Earle and many more.  
<P>

Her new album Day After Tomorrow is the first studio album she has recorded in five years. The theme is one of hope and exploring the pain of life during wartime.  The album was produced by rebel songwriter Steve Earle and features songs by Earle, Eliza Gilkyson, Patty Griffin, and Tom Waits.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">HFS is excited to announce a new partnership with KHSU-FM! For a couple of years, the two organizations have been tossing around the idea of a radio show hosted by HFS... and today, Sunday, from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m., we commence! It will be a bit of a quiet start, until you help us name the show and we can promote it in high style. Please send in your show name suggestions by next Saturday, July 18 -- the creative soul with the perfect name (see general parameters, below) will be gifted with entrance to an upcoming HFS event! We'll display potential names during the festival for folks to vote on their favorites. We'll pick a name soon after and let the whole community know to tune in.

Now, about the show! The program will feature a diversity of American roots music and influences; explore sources of inspiration and skill in local and visiting musicians; and promote local and regional live music, dance, and related educational events.  The program will aim to include a wide range of traditional and contemporary American roots music, including:
"       Acoustic blues and jazz;
"       Old-time stringband and bluegrass;
"       Historical and contemporary folk;
"       World-wide acoustic influences;
"       Cajun and zydeco;
"       Western swing, honky tonk, and rockabilly; and
"       Old country to alternative country.

The show will evolve as your team of DJs learns the ropes, but our eventual intent is to include programming like:
"       Interviews and studio performances by local and visiting artists;
"       Field recordings of interviews and performances (local, regional, and beyond);
"       Information about local and regional folk music and dance activities;
"       Correspondence with musicians from Humboldt County who now live and perform in other parts of the country; and
"       Links to other radio and internet-based music and related folklife programs

Show name parameters we've discussed so far are that 1) it needs to represent this big eclectic list of genres; 2) we'll likely avoid something clunky that includes an element of the HFS name; and 3) we're interested in something creative and perhaps abstract... here are a few blog names that inspired us to get imaginative about it and ask for your help: Wrath of the Grapevine, Uncle Gil's Rockin' Archives and Lonesome Lefty's Scratchy Attic. (But, obviously these names are pretty Americana or oldie focused.)

So, who are your guides on this aural folk adventure? We're excited to announce that, behind the mic will be:
- Former HFS Boardmember, folkdancer extraordinaire and worldly musician Craig Kurumada;
- HFS supporter and roots archives and blogs wizard, Jay Stallman, who tracks the cutting folk music edge; and
- Yours truly, Sally Goodin;
- With help in the near term from KHSU DJ mentors like Gus Mozart, Brooks Otis and Jen Savage!

Stay tuned for more about this new partnership with KHSU. Many thanks to the station and University for partnering with HFS to make the show a reality! We're honored to inhabit the same radio hour of longtime HFS Boardmember Don Wolski's Bayside Hayride... we love and miss you, Don!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Nathen Maxwell (of Flogging Molly) and the Original Bunny Gang </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Humbrews - 856 10th St, Arcata - Monday, August 24 - 10pm - $10<P>
There comes a time in his life when each and every man needs to express himself, and for Nathen Maxwell that time has come. For the past thirteen years Maxwell has been leaving his heart on stage as the bassist for the seminal Celtic rock band Flogging Molly, one of the biggest touring punk acts in the world. An accomplished songwriter in his own right, Maxwell has contributed songs to Flogging Molly albums in years past, but things progressed differently when the band went into the studio to record Float, their most recent release. I played these songs for the band and our singer Dave [King] said, Nate, youve got your own story and I really think you should record these songs, Maxwell explains. Once I got his blessing I figured itd be bad karma not to record and release them. <P>

The tracks on White Rabbit were written over the past ten years spanning from when Flogging Molly were playing weekend gigs until more recent days that have seen the act play over two hundred shows a year. However when the group collectively decided that theyd be relaxing their grueling tour schedule in 2009, Maxwell knew that this would be the perfect time to put these tracks to tape. All Ive got is music: Ive got no plan B, no wealthy family members and no savings, he explains. But I have these songs and this music Ive been wanting to do for a decadeand now just seemed like the right time to do it, whereas the last five years havent been. To capture the true spirit of these songs, Maxwell hooked up with his father, who he not only refers to as his favorite drummer, but who is also responsible for introducing Nathen to Flogging Molly.  Its comes full circle musically for my dad and I, and I couldnt be happier or more proud in returning the favor to him. <P>

In the studio, Maxwell teamed up with long time Flogging Molly producer Ted Hutt (The Gaslight Anthem, Chuck Ragan, Lucero, Bouncing Souls, Street Dogs). I wanted to record these songs in the most simple and effective way possible, Maxwell explains, my guitar playing is very limited to rhythm and my rhythms are really limited to certain strumming patterns and a reggae skank, but aside from that it was really about whatever came naturally. The result is a refreshingly stripped-down album that fully reconciles Maxwells love of rock, reggae and folk music into an honest collection of songs that will appeal as much to fans of Jack Johnson, Manu Chao, and Bob Marley as it will Flogging Molly and the Pogues. I was a little anxious and stressed out when we went into the studio because it was my first time doing something like this, he admits, but in the end it was just an amazing experience. <P>

This adventurous spirit clearly comes across on White Rabbit from the authentic reggae-feel of By Your Side to tender acoustic ballads like Salt And Sand and upbeat acoustically driven tracks like Love Outlaw. When asked how he was able to reconcile all of his influences into one cohesive collection of songs, Maxwell asserts, art in my opinion should send a message on behalf of the people - to me thats what the best art does and that is a common thread throughout this record. That common thread is more important than the scene or style of music, he continues, adding that discovering Bob Marleywhos portrait he has inked on his armwas a huge turning point in his life. That feeling of solidarity is bigger than punk rock and its bigger than reggae and its bigger than everything; thats it for me. <P>

While Maxwell doesnt like to beat the listener over the head when it comes to his lyrics, he does concede that this project is also a vehicle for him to get his positive message across without risking alienation. I come from a pretty hardcore punk background and I found that when I put on a hardcore punk record people didnt want to hear it unless they were already into itbut you put on a reggae record and whether theyre listening to the lyrics or not, people seem to be more open to the music because the approach is a little softer. Maxwell has tried to apply that approach to his own writing over the years, as evidenced on songs like Walk Humbly Now and Working For The Man, which seem straightforward on the surface, but are bubbling with empowering subtleties. I just wanted to write some songs that have the message of solidarity without sounding too preachy. 
<P>
Ultimately Maxwell would never do anything to take away from playing bass in Flogging Mollya gig he considers the best job in the worldhowever he couldnt be more excited to get these songs out into the world and finally allow an audience outside of his immediate family and bandmates to hear them. I really see this project as limitless, he explains. I have this music inside me that is not Flogging Molly music and it was just time get it out into the world, he summarizes. Lets get it out in the universe and see what it does& because Im up for anything.

<P>--------------<P>AS Presents The Fall Harvest Festival with Built to Spill and aim low kid on Saturday, August 29th at 6 p.m. on the staff parking lot between Gist Hall and Student Business Services on Rossow Street, HSU. Built to Spill were one of the most popular indie rock acts of the '90s, finding the middle ground between postmodern, Pavement-style pop and the loose, spacious jamming of Neil Young. From the outset, the band was a vehicle for Doug Martsch, who revived the concept of the indie guitar hero just as Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis  another important influence  was beginning to fade from the limelight. On record, Martsch the arranger crafted intricate, artfully knotted tangles of guitar; in concert, his rough-edged soloing heroics earned Built to Spill a reputation as an exciting and unpredictable live act. Tickets are $15 general and $5 HSU students. Tickets are available at the Works in Arcata and Eureka, University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu. 

<P>
The first incarnation Built to Spill was formed in Boise, ID, in 1993, shortly after Doug Martsch had departed the Boise-rooted, Seattle-based Treepeople. Built to Spill scored a creative breakthrough with 1994's acclaimed There's Nothing Wrong with Love. 
<P>
The positive response to There's Nothing Wrong with Love -- coupled with the increased exposure of being a part of the Lollapalooza tour of 1995 -- helped create a buzz around Built to Spill, and before the end of the year, Martsch inked a deal with Warner Brothers Records that promised a good amount of creative control.  
<P>

Finally released in 1997 the bands Warner Brothers debut, Perfect from Now On was a set of longer, moodier songs that once again earned positive reviews, and substantially expanded the band's growing fan base. 
<P>

Material for Built to Spills next album was, for the first time, worked out through collaborative effort -- mostly full-band jam sessions. Despite those origins, Keep It Like a Secret emerged as the tightest batch of songs on any Built to Spill record yet, and was greeted with some of their most enthusiastic reviews to date when it appeared in 1999; it also became their first to reach the pop charts. In response to demand from fans, the Live album was culled from the supporting tour, it was released in 2000. After a long break from releasing records, a revamped Built to Spill stormed back with one of the finest records of their career, 2006's You in Reverse.

<p>
" Umphrey's Mcgee played fast and hard the whole night, without ever once getting lazy or self indulgent, the mark of a good performance." - Alex Borsody (jambase)





<p>
A mantis is an insect with an exceptional range of vision. 
<p>
Mantis is the Greek word for prophet. 
<p>
And Mantis is the epic new album by Midwestern monsters of improvised rock, Umphrey's McGee. 
<p>
Consisting of Brendan Bayliss (guitar, vocals), Jake Cinninger (guitar, synthesizers, vocals), Joel Cummins (keyboards, vocals), Andy Farag (percussion), Kris Myers (drums, vocals), and Ryan Stasik (bass), Umphrey's McGee enters its second decade together with their most progressive, melodic and artistically cohesive album to date. 
<p>
And that date is Inauguration Day, January 20, 2009, when Mantis casts another Windy City family into the limelight. <p>

A long-time-coming labor of love as well as an inspiring affirmation of musical brotherhood, Mantis is Umphrey's first fully fleshed-out studio statement since 2006's Safety in Numbers, which was followed by 2007's odds-and-sods collection The Bottom Half and the double live album Live at Murat. So when Brendan Bayliss sings, We believe there's something here worth dying for, to kick off Mantis's majestic twelve-minute title track, you should take him at his word. <p>

Mantis is the first Umphrey's album to consist entirely of material never previously performed on the road, where the band rules the improv-rock circuit and plays more than 100 shows each year. Although the band already plays numerous songs they have yet to record, sometimes you just have to hold back in order to deliver a bigger bang. Mystique, thy name is Mantis. 
<p>
Umphrey's recorded their eighth album in an unusually relaxed fashion over the course of some twenty months in Manny Sanchez's I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago (Steve Albini's Electrical Audio was also used). It really helps to have a great friend who loves the band and who runs one of the best studios in town, says Cinninger. Manny has been a godsend. The bands longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, meticulously edited and mixed the material on Mantis; the result is Umphreys finest produced album to date. <p>

Virtuosos and connoisseurs of The Riff, Umphrey's has concocted a visual grammar of hand signals and body language to toss musical ideas back and forth during the experimental Jimmy Stewart improvisations that punctuate their three-hour shows. Mantis likewise began at riff level, when many of the band members presented each other with CDs containing hundreds of riffs they'd composed over the past dozen years. The best of these were painstakingly displaced, modulated, and shifted about like Lego blocks, growing from rough drafts into the elegant and emotionally fulfilling tracks on Mantis. 
<p>
But isn't Umphrey's basically a jam band? you ask. Not on this album. We didn't want to overload the record with 80 minutes of music, Cinninger says. We wanted to make it feel a certain way, so we trimmed away a lot of the fat. The result is a concise 54-minute tour de force, where the soulful guitar of Cinninger and intriguing lyrics of Bayliss blend with Cummins' jazz-funk pianistics, Myers' volcanic swing, Stasik's flowing bass, and Farag's bright percussive color  making Mantis a virtual roadmap of rock's outer limits. <p>

Even Cinninger's usually predominant guitar lashings sound all the more remarkable for their tactical precision. There were a few key guitar moments where I really opened up and wanted to make a statement, he says. I wanted the solos to feel natural, like on old Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin records, when guitar solos were special moments that sounded very live and off the cuff. <p>

Mantis's delivery system is as innovative as the record itself. Pre-orders promise an unprecedented level of downloadable bonus content  including demos, live tracks, alternate takes, and fly-on-the-wall studio visits  that increase in quantity depending on how many pre-orders are received, putting the overall success of the pre-order in the hands of the fans. The more orders that come in, the more the fans will get. Mantis will also use innovative PUSH(TM) technology by Digital Insert to continue delivering exclusive bonus material throughout 2009 via a site that can only be accessed with a physical or digital copy of the album. (www.umphreys.com/mantis/). 
<p>
Founded in 1997 in the shadows of the Golden Dome of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Umphreys McGee soon made Chicago home base, and set their sights on becoming one of the premier live acts in todays touring circuit. Over the course of the last ten years, the band has performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, and continues to sell out shows in the nations premier venues coast to coast. They have toured Europe multiple times and performed at Japans Fuji Rock Festival in 2006. As their sound evolves with every passing show, the live concerts sold on their expansive music archive site UMLive.net continue to be in high demand by their hungry fan base. The second decade of Umphreys McGee is fueled with Mantis in the tank, and the band shows no signs of letting up.

"If you can listen and let the music push you as your guide, you can get to a place you know you've never been before. And when a band realizes that and shares this sense of discovery, that is the golden moment of the thing. A shared moment of consciousness with the band and the audience ...that's what I'm going for."  -Steve Kimock


<P>

Steve Kimock will be hitting the road this fall with his new project Steve Kimock Crazy Engine. Exploring a new direction, Crazy Engine is a Steve Kimock project unlike any other. Pushing the boundaries of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, gospel and soul, the repertoire will include Kimock classics as well as an energized catalogue of covers and fresh material.
<P>
For nearly four decades Steve Kimock has earned a reputation as a guitarist with an enlightened approach to melodic improvisation and has captured audiences from around the globe with his tasteful guitar speak and brilliant tone. Labeled the "guitar monk" by Relix Magazine for his relentless pursuit of the art of guitar, Steve Kimock blends all of his influences, capturing the spirit of the music wherever he goes, while tuning into sounds from some unseen dimensions. 
<P>
The long-awaited project will also feature legendary Hammond B3 player, Melvin Seals, best known for his work with the Jerry Garcia Band. The glistening new line up also includes the cookin' rhythm section of Janis Wallin on bass (Family Groove Company) and Kimock's own son, John Morgan Kimock on drums. Rounding out the configuration with their soulful crooning are "The Girls" on vocals, featuring Cheryl Rucker and Shirley Starks (Melvin Seals and JGB). 

<P>
About Steve KImock:
<P>
Like many people, Kimock at first, fell under the spell of The Beatles, but he also had an aunt, Dorothy Siftar, who played the Philadelphia Folk Festival with Pete Seeger, so his musical horizons were broadened at a young age. When a cousin came home from the service with a gold Les Paul, Kimock was hooked. He got a guitar and played it 12 hours a day, every day. He still does. "I occasionally put it down to take a shower or eat some food," he jokes, but he's still in love with the guitar and all its stringed relations. <P>

After the usual high school bands, Kimock joined the Goodman Brothers Band. The group moved to California in 1976. Kimock's first home was a cabin in Marin, directly behind the Ali Akbar Khan School of Music. Every morning he woke to the sound of sarods and sitars, inspiring the interest in the music of other cultures that still colors his own compositions. "I like music of cultures that predate the keyboard. I enjoy the natural temperament more than the 12 equal divisions of the octave. That's why I like the blues." 
<P>
For the rest of his career Kimock has balanced his own bands with freelance session and touring work. After a stint with Martin Fierro in The Underdogs, he joined The Heart of Gold Band with Grateful Dead members Keith and Donna Godchaux and drummer Greg Anton. Kimock and Anton split to start Zero, a project that lasted 15 years. "The music was eclectic, instrumental but not jazz fusion, mostly with a folk/Americana flavor, but open to anything." <P>

KVHW was collaboration with Bobby Vega, Alan Hertz and Ray White, a brilliant, but short-lived band with a set list of great covers and original compositions. Unfortunately, all the players became so busy that the band couldn't survive. 
<P>
Six years ago, Kimock put together the Steve Kimock Band. When Rodney Holmes joined five years ago, everything clicked into place. Following the release of the critically acclaimed Eudemonic CD, the Steve Kimock Band toured for two years with Rodney Holmes, Reed Mathis and Robert Walter.  Throughout 2006 and 2007, Kimock has been enjoying exploring new projects performing in various configurations with The Rhythm Devils, Banyan, New Monsoon, George Porter, Jr. and PBS, The Everyone Orchestra, ALO as well as reunion performances with ZERO and Bobby Vega (KVMW  with John Molo, and Ray White) as well as sitting in for Mark Karan in Bob Weir and Ratdog.

"EOTO's music is constantly shifting... It starts with a single idea, a seed that quickly grows and develops into myriad of flavors for the ear. Their sound is eclectic, avant-garde and continuously evolving while maintaining its dance party backdrop as a platform for improvisation." - Herschel Concepcion 



Jason Hann and Michael Travis (percussionist and drummer from the band The String Cheese Incident) make up this 100% improvised live Breakbeat/ House/ Drum n Bass/ Trip Hop project. Drawing from the ethos of some of the great DJ's and computer artists of the world, they use cutting edge technology to create truly original and melodic dance music in the moment, with the undeniable power of live drums. The music is all created on the spot, recorded, then mixed and remixed LIVE to create an ever evolving musical experience. Since the project is 100% improvised, every night promises to be a unique dance experience. Hann and Travis play different roles in this band than in SCI. Jason plays the drum kit, percussion and sampler, while Travis is in charge of the tonal elements, playing bass, guitar, keyboards, as well as hand percussion and live mixing. 

Michael Travis is a pioneer in the art of modern improvisational jam-rock drumming. He is especially known for his groundbreaking work on playing both hand drums and the drum kit simultaneously. As the drummer for the highly accomplished band, The String Cheese Incident, he has developed a unique style that is very supportive of a free jam aesthetic while still always laying it down. He further develops that approach in EOTO by being super solid to the point of emulating grooves that some of the best programmers and DJs would create, except with that elusive human feel. Travis has played along side some of the worlds greatest drummers while playing with String Cheese including Trilok Gurtu, Babatunde Olatunji, and Bill Kruetzman; & he has collaborated with many other artists including Keller Williams, Karl Denson, Steve Kimock, Warren Haynes, & Bela Fleck. With EOTO, he gets to stretch-out into brand-new territory; Handing over the rhythmic element to Jason, Trav is finally able to test out his melodic chops, playing the electric bass, electric guitar, keyboards, & samplers in addition to his EOTO mini-kit during the duo's spontaneous compositions. 

Jason Hann is an accomplished composer/percussionist/ drummer who has been playing professionally since the age of 12. Growing up in Miami, Florida, he was exposed early to international music through his father, who is also a musician. Combined with his Colombian heritage through his mom, Jason grew up embracing rhythms from all parts of the globe. Music has taken him around the world, studying first hand in countries such as Mali, Ghana, Haiti, and Korea, both learning and performing folkloric and contemporary music of the land. A dynamic performer, Jason has also produced, composed, recorded, and toured internationally within many different genres of music including Rock, R&B, Pop, Hip Hop/Rap, Jazz, Latin, Latin-Jazz, Flamenco, African, Persian, Electronica, Techno, Brazilian, Indian and other fusions of World music. In addition to his current musical project EOTO, Jason has recently expressed his musical energy through The String Cheese Incident and each of his fellow band members' respective side-projects, through his solo electronica and all-percussion recordings, and through working with other artists such as Loreena McKinnet and Vinx . Jason continues to hit the road with legendary soul man Issac Hayes when possible. With a diverse background of musical collaborations that include Youssou N'Dour, Keller Williams, Rickie Lee Jones and Dr. Dre, it is evident that Jason will continue living in the musical moment for a long time to come.

GREENSKY BLUEGRASS          <P>   http://www.myspace.com/greenskybluegrassmusic        <P>
Greensky Bluegrass West Coast tour lands at Humboldt Brews Saturday October 31st for a night of Tricks and Treats

<P>
"...every great album starts with great songs and this record is no exception. Songs of hope, truth, loss, and love of family and friends are all here. Songs that will make you laugh, dance and think. And songs of grace." -Tim Carbone

<P>


GREENSKY BLUEGRASS is one of the most exciting bands in today's music scene. Like a breath of fresh air, this five piece band plays traditional bluegrass instruments and uses them to create original songs and soundscapes that are unique and new, yet somehow feel comfortable and familiar. Though they have been likened to '70s era Americana acts like The Band, Greensky would prefer not to be compared to any other bands. "We really just try to make music as a group that sounds and feels right to us", says mandolin player Paul Hoffman, later adding that "it is nice to know that other people really dig it, too." 

<P>
"Greensky Bluegrass hits timeless targets with deadly accuracy while simultaneously veering off the tired and true highway."-Jambase.com
<P>

While "green sky" is the opposite of "blue grass", the band insists that the name came about as more of a pun than a statement about their music. "Along with the tradition of bluegrass, we all have lots of different musical influences that we bring to the table", says guitar player Dave Bruzza, "and we somehow wanted to reflect that in our name." Upon witnessing the band's live shows, this statement seems to make a little more sense. On any given night, in addition to the myriad of excellent original songs, one might hear traditional bluegrass songs with an exploratory rock and roll jam or selections from the Talking Heads, Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead or Bob Marley turned bluegrass. "We are as likely to play a three minute song as we are a ten minute song on any given night", says dobro player Anders Beck, "and I think that keeps it exciting for the audience". Perhaps this is the reason that Greensky Bluegrass is as equally embraced by the jam-band community as it is the bluegrass/Americana community and the band's fan base is growing so rapidly. 
<P>
"Of course, this is bluegrass. So manic chops mean a lot to Greensky Bluegrass. Yet they are also masterful storytellers. Mandolinist Paul Hoffman in particular pens some true rural balladry." -Seattle Weekly
<P>
Greensky Bluegrass is touring in support of their recently released fourth album, "Five Interstates", which was produced by Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth. The album, their strongest to date, features twelve original tracks and one traditional bluegrass song (a nod to the deceased King of Bluegrass, Jimmy Martin) ,and showcases the band's songwriting and playing talents in a way that is incredibly accessible to fans of many different types of music.  Carbone notes on the package: "Five Interstates came together like five lives intertwined, the intersection of a lifetime frozen in precious time and preserved in a digital tableau. I'm blessed&We're all blessed to be witness to a band ascending as true as an arrow shot to the sky."
<P>

Since winning the 2006 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest, Greensky has been touring constantly, playing over 170 shows a year, and all the hard work is certainly paying off. Recent highlights are too many to list, but include selling out venues in many parts of the country, sharing the stage with musical heroes, getting asked to play shows with the likes of  Tony Rice and Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Yonder Mountain String Band and Railroad Earth, and being asked to play the inaugural Rothbury Festival in their home state of Michigan. "It certainly felt like an affirmation that we are doing something right", noted bass player Mike Devol. 
<P>
Greensky Bluegrass is Anders Beck (dobro), Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), Mike Devol (upright bass) and Paul Hoffman (mandolin).

Highly energized funk machine ,KARL DENSON'S TINY UNIVERSE, lands at the Red Fox Tavern Tuesday October 6th
<P>


"Im not one to live in the past. I am very much a forward thinker. Brothers Keeper is a continuation of my general world view, which is that we should be loving each other, having fun and taking care of one another, This record is the culmination of all my lifes work up until now.- Karl Denson





<P>
Karl Denson's Tiny Universe has been expanding listeners' minds and making them move to animated grooves since 1998. Led by former Lenny Kravitz sax-man Karl Denson, the Tiny Universe brings a dynamic sound that defies categorization. The band members,have earned a reputation as kings of the unstoppable all-night show. 

 <P>

I am trying to lead my fans to a more positive and proactive place, confides Karl Denson. I think all music has the ability to unite people. The vocalist and saxman knows a thing or two about uniting people. Over the years Karl Densons music has crossed cultural and generational boundaries and his ability to reinvent himself has made him one of the most exciting musicians of his generation. Denson, who co-founded the pioneering west coast soul jazz outfit The Greyboy Allstars and the popular powerhouse groove ensemble Karl Densons Tiny Universe cites influences as diverse as The Rolling Stones, Herbie Hancock, David Bowie and Wayne Shorter.  The Southern California native, who has worked with a whos who list in music including Lenny Kravitz, Michael Franti (Spearhead), Saul Williams, The Allman Brothers and James Brown alum Fred Wesley, continues his musical evolution on Brothers Keeper (Shanachie Entertainment  September 22, 2009).

 <P>

My style is based in dance shares Karl.  I love the idea of creating something that naturally makes people want to move. Fusing elements of Motown, rock, funk, and blues, Brothers Keeper is a refreshing mix of soulful and organic originals. Recorded over a few weeks in May of 2009 and produced by Denson, Chris Goldsmith (The Blind Boys of Alabama, Charlie Musslewhite, Ruthie Foster) and Tiny Universe keyboardist David Veith, Brother's Keeper opens with the bluesy Marvin Gaye/Ray Charles-esque showstopper Shake it Out.  Showing off his witty side, Karl gets a bit tongue and cheek with the head-nodding and groove heavy number, Where It Counts, which he explains, is about my girls mind but the lyrics make it sound like I am talking about her ass. Switchfoot lead singer Jon Foreman contributed the powerful and catchy The Drums of War and also co-wrote Mighty Rebel which Karl cites as his favorite composition on the CD.  Karl shows off his tender and introspective side with Monica, about his first true love and the soulful ballad Take It Down Low which was written for his wife who he says, along with his three kids, keep him balanced. 
<P>
 

With a penchant for unrelenting jams, great storytelling and fearless improvisational freedom, Karl Denson delivers the goods on Brothers Keeper . The title track is a tune that Denson nurtured for several years. If you listen to that whole song, the music was written in literally seven minutes. I turned on the tape recorder and sang from beginning to end but then it took me actually a couple of years to write the lyrics, shares Karl. I'd given two people the recording of me humming for seven minutes, saying 'I know this is a really great song, but I don't know what to do with it until finally I came up with the lyrics. I'm really happy about how it turned out. Also featured on Brothers Keeper is Just Got Paid, a humorous mix of New Orleans groove, electronica and funk. I was sitting around, waiting for the next check to come in and the bills were piling up, shares Karl. And then my son broke his arm. With all of these things going on, I just had to laugh and say, 'this is my life - you know?' 

 
<P>
The all-star musical line-up on Brothers Keeper is testament to Karl Densons level of respect on the creative music scene. The introspective and dynamic musician is joined by: Meshell Ndegeocello (bass), Marc Ford (guitar, Black Crowes, Ben Harper), Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Kenneth Crouch (Eric Clapton, Lenny Kravitz), Zak Najor (drums, The Greyboy Allstars), Brian Jordan (guitar), Shawn Banks (percussionist Burnt Sugar), Jonathan Talbot (strings), Laura Reed and Debrissa McKinney (vocals, Laura Reed and Deep pocket), Cochemea Gastelum (baritone sax, Dap Kings, Antibalas), Dave Smith (trombone), and Michael Leonhart (horns).


<P>

I think music chose me, confesses Karl Denson, who started playing music in the seventh grade. Listening to a steady diet of Motown, James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, jazz, rock and roll and punk music, Denson developed a broad musical taste.  A musicians musician, Denson has been called upon by some of the industrys brightest stars from virtually every genre imaginable. He collaborated with Kravitz for close to two decades including during the rock stars most liberated period of music-making (the Let Love Rule and Mama Said albums of the early 90s). During this time, Karl learned a lot about the importance of detail from Kravitz.  His attention to detail is one of the big things I got from him, he explains. He would spend the most incredible amount of time in the simplest details and we were kind of like 'Len, we got it,' but when you finally went out and performed, it all came together and made sense.

Charlie has a knack for always taking his music and becoming the front and center and everything in between. On Baboon Strength, Charlie takes a step back and allows his collaborators, Tony Mason (drums) and Erik Deutsch (organ), into the spotlight with him. From the first notes of the opening track you know that this is going to be a party album. Initially sounding like another Garage-A-Trois album, the music settles in as swirling and other worldly sounds dance out of the speakers, leaving you in a groovin daze.  Musical Stew Daily






"I knew that I wanted to do this with my life from when I was 16", says Hunter about his musical career. His early recognition of this may have been influenced by the fact that he grew up in homes where his mother repaired guitars for a living in Berkeley, California where he has lived since he was eight years old. Charlie picked up his first guitar when he was twelve years old for $7, and a few years later was taking lessons from Joe Satriani, who at that time was just another guitar teacher. "People can't believe that but I was just another Berkeley kid and every Berkeley kid took lessons from Joe Satriani. He must have had a hundred students. He's a great teacher." 

Charlie graduated from the same Berkeley high school whose music program produced saxophonist Joshua Redman and pianist Benny Green, but Hunter did not participate in the school's prestigious music program. "I really wasn't an institutional-type person. I had to go out and do my own thing. I was a naughty kid who went through the crazy angst-driven hysteria many teenagers experience," says Hunter, who doesn't deny not making it to class much. "Because I was from a low-income family, I was tracked into the lowest level of academic courses. You didn't get a chance to develop much self-esteem there, so I decided to focus on something that made me feel good. I graduated by the skin of my teeth." 

"I was into everything at that point - blues, rockabilly, funk and soul...", but it wasn't until Hunter turned 18 that he discovered jazz. "My friends said, 'You got to get into jazz, you've got to listen to Weather Report.' And I thought, 'This is fusion. I'm not really into that.' So then somebody told me I should listen to Wes Montgomery, but the album I got was one of those with strings, and I was totally turned off. Finally, somebody said, 'You need to check out Charlie Parker and Charlie Christian and John Coltrane,' and it was like boom! I was instantly turned on. Their total sound and the reality of their playing just cut through everything. I suddenly wanted to play like that." 

Hunter soon discovered and became heavily influenced by such organ legends as Jimmy Smith, Larry Young, and Big John Patton. Mix this with some of his favorite artists from other genres such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and Little Walter, and you can see where Hunter's sound came from. But it was the exposure to so many various genres of music that Charlie is thankful for. "Growing up in the Bay Area had a profound effect on my music. I was exposed to everything from the Dead Kennedy's to P-Funk to Art Blakey. In the Bay Area, you have all of these different musical cultures living together and all of these different musical cultures and their music gets semi-assimilated into this non-polarized state of being where hybrids are free to grow, and there are all of these genres and cross genres to play in and around." 

Charlie had his first 7-string guitar (2 bass strings, 5 guitar strings, 2 pickups) made for him in the late eighties, and, after figuring out how to play his custom-made toy, left for Europe to perform on the streets of Paris and Zurich. Upon returning to the states and gigging around South of Market clubs in San Francisco and in Berkeley playing by himself (covering both bass and guitar parts) he hooked up with poet/rapper Michael Franti. They performed together as a duo from time to time until Franti formed the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and brought Charlie with him. In 1993, Charlie joined them on their tour which included a year's worth of huge stadium gigs opening for U2 along with Primus. 

Charlie left Disposable Heroes in 1993 in search of more jazz-oriented music. "It was interesting, but that whole pop art scene was an overall drag. I love pop music, but it's a lot different when you get to sit back and be on the receiving end. It was difficult for me as an artist who's dedicated to searching for the spiritual core of music to have to deal with being in a situation where the quest is in the most superficial, consumer-driven aspects of the recording industry. It's hard enough driving for hours to get to the next city. When you get there, you at least want to play music that excites you." He recruited his old elementary school friend Dave Ellis who was first chair tenor in the Berkeley High jazz orchestra. Although they traveled in different social circles, they remained friends throughout the years. "We did play together occasionally. As a matter of fact, I think Dave still has blackmail tapes." It wasn't until now though that he and Ellis hooked up for serious jazz sessions. With the addition of Jay Lane, who played drums in the original lineup of Primus, the Charlie Hunter Trio was formed. 

After a few months of gigging around the Bay Area, the Trio landed a weekly gig every Tuesday night at the Elbo Room in San Francisco. This is where Hunter says they began to jell as a group playing a distinctive Bay Area style of jazz. "That's where we learned to study the past and practice the present." Primus leader, Les Claypool, soon talked the band into recording an album for him on his own label, Prawn Song Records (the logo spoofs Led Zeppelin's Swan Song label portraying a shrimp with wings) a subsidiary of Mammoth Records. The self-titled Charlie Hunter Trio album was released at the beginning of 1994. 

"I think our music is an alternative to the suit-and-tie club that says you have to be well-to-do and super-intellectual to understand jazz music", Charlie continues. "We don't have that attitude. We play at places where people aren't interested in pigeonholing instrumental music." As a result, most Bay Area gigs were priced at no more than $5 and Charlie began exposing jazz to an audience that may otherwise have stayed away from it. "We're jazz musicians, but we're jazz musicians from their generation. That's who we share aspects of a common life with and that's who we are trying to reach." 

"We know the lineage of jazz and we're completely in debt to it. We've built the foundation of our music on John Coltrane, on Charlie Parker, on Art Tatum and Thelonious Monk, all the way back through Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton to the turn of the century. We want people to know that this is the music that means the most to us. But we also want our audience to know that we are from the twenty something generation, that we share the same experiences as a lot of people our age. That's what we want to communicate; that's what inspires us. I am very proud of the fact that our audience is very diverse. There are a lot of women who come to our shows. There are a lot of kids-I mean teens and young adults-who bring their parents. And there are a lot of moms and dads who bring their kids, and that makes me feel like we're doing something right." 

As Hunter started garnering more attention, the media sought a label to describe his music...though with much difficulty. The most popular label was "acid jazz" which has come to signify everything from upbeat covers of jazz standards to drum-machine-backed, sampled dance music. "I don't really know what acid jazz is," says Hunter. "Sometimes the press needs a term to advertise something. We sometimes get resistance from mainstream [jazz] critics who label us [acid jazz]. What we play is accessible but not as accessible as all that." Charlie dislikes the term so much, he created his own label for the music he plays; "antacid jazz." "I like to think of what I do as improvisational-oriented pop music. I'd say the only people doing what we're doing is Medeski, Martin & Wood, and they've been doing it longer, taking improvised music to the people." John Medeski agrees. "Basically, we're doing the same thing jazz did in the 40's and 50's. We're playing improvised music informed by the better pop sensibilities of the day. We take the groove and dance music we grew up with and create something that has a little more depth to it. In a certain way, we are doing the same thing as Charlie. We have that link of improvisational music, but we're making it relevant to what's going on today." 

Always striving for something new, Charlie had the urge to make some changes to the Charlie Hunter Trio to allow for more musical growth. "I had done the trio thing long enough. I needed to take the next step. I either wanted to add a trumpet or an alto sax guy. When Calder came to town, I know he'd be perfect." Hunter met Calder Spanier, son of Canadian trumpet player, Herbie Spanier, in Montreal in the early eighties and hooked up with him again gigging on the streets in Europe. "He is so incredible, he's a natural. We played in various groups together in Europe. We did it up right. The poor, romantic artistes...the whole bit." Charlie was extremely happy with the addition of his buddy Spanier to the group. "He brings to this band a great sound, solos, and tunes as well as slapstick humor." 

The Quartet was approached by Blue Note who requested them to be a part of their Cover Series project for their next album, asking them to cover an entire classic album by another artist of their choice. Hunter agreed and though it was a grueling decision , he narrowed it down to three records; Smiley Smile by the Beach Boys, Superfly by Curtis Mayfield, and Natty Dread by Bob Marley. The band settled on Natty Dread. They worked out arrangements for the tunes, and started playing some of those arrangements on the road before returning back home to fine-tune the songs at a series of gigs at the Elbo Room. The Quartet then went into the studio to record the Bob Marley classic. "We recorded most of the tunes on first or second take so it feels like a live album." 

During another weekly stint at the Elbo Room, the Quartet became a Quintet with the addition of a young Bay Area trumpet player named Chuck MacKinnon. While he played during this 3 month run with the band, finances prevented MacKinnon from joining the Quartet on the road, which they set out for after the local gigs. This tour sent them internationally to places such as Holland as well as New York where Charlie made his first national television appearance on the Conan O'Brien show. On this tour, the Quartet would sometimes pull out the whole Marley album from beginning to end to the delight of the audience. "People love it. They can't believe we pull it off. That's cool because we had fun doing the project." 

To round out his new lineup, Charlie felt vibes were in order. "I had been listening to a lot of vibe players lately...I was excited by the fresh tonal possibilities as well as the versatility of the instrument and how it would blend in with the rest of the rhythm section." 

To avoid the confusion of calling this band the Charlie Hunter Quartet and to emphasize the change in the sound of his new lineup, Charlie came up with the name Pound for Pound. "Catchy, isn't it? I just like how it sounds. I got the idea watching the boxer Roy Jones Jr. being interviewed on a talk show. He was saying that as a middleweight or light heavyweight boxer, he didn't make a whole lot of money, but pound for pound he claimed he was the best fighter in the land." 

Feeling the need for a change of scenery, accompanied by the desire to grow musically and have more opportunities to play with a variety of musicians, Hunter relocated to Brooklyn, New York in late 1997. "Here, my career can go so much farther, and I play with so many more people. I'm more inspired, and I can become a better player...You know, you just walk down the street and run into someone and then the next thing you know, you've got a gig-or a recording gig. In the Bay Area, you can walk all day and all night and never get anything." 

In 1999, after heavy touring of the U.S. and Europe, Charlie took another adventurous turn in wanting to record his next album accompanied only by one other musician. "I was excited by the prospect of working in a duo setting," says Hunter. "It's scary and challenging at the same time. Its like flying a helicopter. You have to be on at every moment. Every limb is doing something. There's no rest and no time to recoup your energy. After one hour you're totally expended." 

Hunter is constantly touring and trying to grow musically, and spiritually. "I mean I don't want to get all hippy-dippy, but the goal is to reach the spiritual center of whatever music you're searching for. In that search, for me, it's real important to bring in other people and to have it be a real honest scene in which the audience is also part of the music. I know it's a good show depending on how the crowd is getting into the music. I can feel it when they get the groove, and we play off that." But Charlie is also playing music for himself. "I feel a real urgency in life and that's reflected in my music. It's my only creative outlet. It's the only avenue I have to scream about my life and what's happening in other people's world. It's my fail-safe antidote to the world." 

It is a mission for Hunter to spread his music, but it is also a mission for him to turn others onto music of the past who might not be exposed to it anywhere else. "For some kids, this is their first exposure to jazz. They see how cool the music is and become intrigued enough to want to check out records by Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. If our mission succeeds, hopefully we'll have helped to turn a generation of people onto a much more spiritually and soulfully executed music than what gets played on MTV," says an optimistic Hunter. "It's culturally the duty of the younger generation to help the music evolve. We wouldn't be doing our jobs if we didn't." 

Last year, Charlie Hunter released Baboon Strength. The collection of songs drew from all different influences including Staxx Soul ("Porter-Hayes"), 70's new wave ("Difford-Tilbrook"), and the sounds of a busy city ("Welcome to Frankfurt"). The record has regarded as one of Hunter's most innovative efforts to date. 

Charlie has been in the studio and is just about done wrapping up the recording of his next as-of-yet untitled record. The lineup includes Eric Kalb (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, John Scofield) on drums, Curtis Fowlkes (Jazz Passengers, Lounge Lizards, Bill Frisell) and Alan Ferber (Don Byron, Kenny Wheeler) on trombone, and Eric Biondo (Antibalas TV On The Radio) on trumpet! The CD will be available in advance at the Yoshi's shows in the Bay Area (California) in December and will be available in all digital retailers in January. Stay tuned...

Zepparella's passion for the band Led Zeppelin, blazing guitars, and smokin' hot vocals make for a night of pure rock n roll at Humboldt Brews Saturday February 13th

<P>

"...their mission is clear , playing Led Zeppelin songs as perfect as possible and with similarities very close to the originals. They have succeeded in their mission, which is showing their respect and dignity for a legendary Rock band."  METAL TO INFINITY



<P>
Zepparella is four women intent on bringing the passion, the beauty, the aggression, the musicality of Led Zeppelin alive. Zepparella is no costumed, wigged-up tribute band. You'll hear no backing tracks or misguided attempts at note for note replication. Instead Zepparella offers four seriously talented musicians who have loved and studied this music long enough to make it a part of themselves. It is a celebration of some of the greatest music ever written, by women who love it as musicians and as fans. We who want to celebrate it with you, fellow appreciators. 
<P>
Four women intent on bringing the passion, the beauty, the aggression, keeping the musicality of Led Zeppelin alive. 
<P>
Zepparella delivers an explosive, emotional musical journey at every event. They take on the challenge of balancing their devotion to playing the songs as close to the original as possible, while taking advantage of their own musical communication and carrying the audience away on the ride.
<P>
Individuals with widely diverse musical tastes, Led Zeppelins music is common ground. The magic of Zeppelin was the dynamic energy between the four musicians, and the songs allow Zepparella to feel that energy too.The combination of personalities in Zepparella is something extraordinary. From the first time on stage there was such a strong musical connection that to the girls it felt like a homecoming. And in a musical career, that kind of connection may be the most elusive gift of all.
<P>
The players:
<P>
Anna Kristina, the popular Bay Area stage actress, vocalist, songwriter and solo artist, brings her seductive style and powerful range to front the band with consistently transcendent performances. Her soulful delivery is mesmerizing. 
<P>
Gretchen Menn applies her dazzling and emotive guitar playing to the leads. After her stint as Agnes Young in the top-grossing Bay Area band AC/DShe for three years, and then touring as the second guitarist in the national metal band BOTTOM, she now takes on the Page lines with an arresting ability that cant be missed. 
<P>
Nila Minnerocks seminal bass playing, dark, beautiful, aggressive, melodic, fills out the bottom end of the band. Her joined-at-the-hip connection with Clementine began eleven years ago in BOTTOM, and close to 20 trips around the US, Canada and Europe and three records have created the remarkably intuitive rhythm section that Zeppelin deserves. 
<P>
Clementine tackles the best rock drumming ever written with her own powerfully passionate style, bringing the Motown influence of the Bonham groove to the forefront. As Phyllis Rudd in AC/DShe and throughout the run of BOTTOM, she developed a heavy-hitting sound suited to attempt Zeppelin. The musical connection established with Gretchen in AC/DShe and the lifelong rhythmic conversation with Nila creates the bond required to do this great music justice.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Arcata, Calif. February 11, 2010  After a year of hard work, Humbrews is excited to announce the opening of the new 3,000 square foot entertainment room! The new facility offers new lighting and sound system equipment by Meyer and Gamble, as well as an acoustic ceiling for maximum sound quality. The party room, which once housed the Humboldt Brewing Companys brew vats, can house 375 people for music events. 

<P>
The owners of Humbrews enjoy hosting local events, such as concerts and private parties, so their interest in the unused space adjacent to their facility grew immediately after their grand reopening in 2007. The space was leased to Humbrews in early 2009 and so began the extensive remodeling. 

<P>
Humbrews also wishes to inform the community that the party room is available to rent for your next event or party. We offer a full kitchen, a detailed menu and a lively staff so theres no need to hire catering. Our new in-house sound system will work wonders for your guest speaker, musical talent, or ambient background music. Various packages are available and prices are negotiable according to the event organizers needs.  
<P>

Being separate from the pub itself, the party room setting proves to be both private and intimate. Be it a celebration of a team victory, an awards ceremony, club meeting, employee/company party, or a performance, Humbrews is happy to open its doors to provide for the community that has helped in creating the room itself and thus, the businesss success over its long history. 

<P>
Let us help make your next gathering a success! For any question or further information please feel free to contact Robin or Andy at 826-BREWS, or by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="52203d303b3c3a37253b2626123a3d263f333b3e7c313d3f">[email&#160;protected]</a>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Greensky Bluegrass returns to the Red Fox Tavern Tuesday March 23rd for a night of furious finger picking and rockin' Bluegrass Music
<P>

"Of course, this is bluegrass. So manic chops mean a lot to Greensky Bluegrass. Yet they are also masterful storytellers. Mandolinist Paul Hoffman in particular pens some true rural balladry." -Seattle Weekly


<P>

Michigan's own Greensky Bluegrass is earning recognition nationwide as a growing force in acoustic roots music. One of the most exciting bands in today's music scene. Like a breath of fresh air, this five piece band plays traditional bluegrass instruments and uses them to create original songs and soundscapes that are unique and new, yet somehow feel comfortable and familiar. Though they have been likened to '70s era Americana acts like The Band, Greensky would prefer not to be compared to any other bands. "We really just try to make music as a group that sounds and feels right to us", says mandolin player Paul Hoffman, later adding that "it is nice to know that other people really dig it, too." 

<P>
"Greensky Bluegrass hits timeless targets with deadly accuracy while simultaneously veering off the tired and true highway."-Jambase.com

<P>
Performing at festivals, theaters, clubs and listening rooms all over the US, their rare traditional sound is piquing the interests of not only bluegrass enthusiasts, but lovers of music of all genres. It is their unique "fusion of tradition and enthusiasm for improvisation" that has come to define the band's creative and tangible compositional style. 
Live performance is central to Greensky Bluegrass' presence in today's eclectic acoustic scene. Touring extensively since 2005, Greensky has developed great versatility in the performance arena. The mixing of original compositions with traditional bluegrass numbers gives the band a broad spectrum in which to display their driving technical chops, vocal abilities, and lyrical insight. A spirit of improvisation remains evident in live shows, which contributes to an ever-growing population of returning fans and avid show traders. 
While "green sky" is the opposite of "blue grass", the band insists that the name came about as more of a pun than a statement about their music. "Along with the tradition of bluegrass, we all have lots of different musical influences that we bring to the table", says guitar player Dave Bruzza, "and we somehow wanted to reflect that in our name." Upon witnessing the band's live shows, this statement seems to make a little more sense. On any given night, in addition to the myriad of excellent original songs, one might hear traditional bluegrass songs with an exploratory rock and roll jam or selections from the Talking Heads, Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead or Bob Marley turned bluegrass. "We are as likely to play a three minute song as we are a ten minute song on any given night", says dobro player Anders Beck, "and I think that keeps it exciting for the audience". Perhaps this is the reason that Greensky Bluegrass is as equally embraced by the jam-band community as it is the bluegrass/Americana community and the band's fan base is growing so rapidly. 
<P>
Formed in the fall of 2000 by Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), and Paul Hoffman (mandolin), Greensky has undergone a musical evolution as unique as the music it has produced. As newcomers to the bluegrass scene, the three sought to define themselves within the framework of their bluegrass favorites while establishing a voice of their own, drawing upon an array of influences and varied musical backgrounds. This voice first became evident in their May 2004 release of Less than Supper, recorded with bassist Chris Carr and dobro player Al Bates. Both Bates and Carr left the band shortly thereafter, and in the fall of the same year, Greensky Bluegrass welcomed bassist Michael Devol. In the summer of 2006, the band won the Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest and released their second studio album, Tuesday Letter. This album, produced by Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth, has proven a milestone in the quartet's growth as musicians and increasing exposure to a thriving national community. 
<P>
In November of 2007 the band released it's first live CD Live at Bell's, recorded at Bell's Brewery in their hometown of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Just over a month later Greensky Bluegrass added Anders Beck to the line up, replacing Al Bates on dobro. His playing is adding great depth to their existing material and opening many doors to new songs. The new quintet recorded Five Interstates, their latest studio album in the late spring of 2008. It was produced by Tim Carbone of Railroad Earth. The album, their strongest to date, features twelve original tracks and one traditional bluegrass song (a nod to the deceased King of Bluegrass, Jimmy Martin) ,and showcases the band's songwriting and playing talents in a way that is incredibly accessible to fans of many different types of music.  Carbone notes on the package: "Five Interstates came together like five lives intertwined, the intersection of a lifetime frozen in precious time and preserved in a digital tableau. I'm blessed&We're all blessed to be witness to a band ascending as true as an arrow shot to the sky."
2009 Also saw the first release in The Greensky Bluegrass' LIVE Series, Live from The Riviera Theatre Three Rivers, MI.  2010 is proves to be another stellar year for the boys from Michigan, as they are slated to release the second album in their LIVE Series and head back into the studio to record a new album.
Touring constantly and playing over 170 shows a year, the hard work is certainly paying off. Recent highlights are too many to list, but include selling out venues in many parts of the country, sharing the stage with musical heroes, getting asked to play shows with the likes of  Tony Rice and Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Yonder Mountain String Band and Railroad Earth, and being asked to play the inaugural Rothbury Festival in their home state of Michigan. "It certainly felt like an affirmation that we are doing something right", noted bass player Mike Devol. 
<P>
Other on-stage collaborations have paired the boys with, The Hackensaw Boys, Larry Keel and Natural Bridge and Steppin' in It. The band has also shared bills with influential acts including Ralph Stanley, Sam Bush, New Monsoon, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Keller Williams, Hot Buttered Rum, Vince Herman, The Mammals, The Avett Brothers, Darrell Scott, King Wilkie, David Grisman Quintet and more.

<P>

"G. Love gets your head nodding with a unique groove. The lyrical work of the songs/raps tend to dwell on love and having fun...the real message lies in the soul shining through G. Love's delivery." - Haig Assadourian (JamBase)



<P>

Tart, Tangy, Smooth, and oh so lip-smacking Sweet! Aaah yes, time to praise the almighty summer sippin' thirst quencher, being served straight up G. Love and Special Sauce style, ice cool and always refreshing. On their second release for Brushfire Records, the Philly boys offer up Lemonade, a series of soul drenched tracks pouring out their blues infused hip-hop, which people have been trying to label for years. The best advice - dont try to tame it or claim it; its simply their sonic trademark, instantly recognizable and addictively delicious. 
<P>
The whole thing about lemonade for me was when I first set out from Philly to make it in the music world I went up to Boston, and I would just sit on the front porch of my place after playing the streets or practicing and make myself a big pitcher of lemonade. It just symbolized old time porch loungin' for that's where I did a lot of my shedding and writing. It was so simple and great, I said, if I ever get a record deal I'm going to get Lemonade tattooed on my arm. 
<P>
It's there all right, and seven albums, thirteen years, and over a million worldwide units later, Lemonade is the most cohesive and rewarding album Garrett Dutton - a.k.a. G. Love (guitar, vocals, harmonica, sweat and tears) has ever delivered. Produced and engineered in the womb of Philadelphonic Studios by Chris DiBeneditto (Electric Mile & Philadelphonic) and faithfully anchored by the Sauce, Jimi Jazz Prescott (acoustic bass), and Jeffrey Thunderhouse Clemens (drums, percussion), G. pairs up with some of the best players in the game including Ben Harper, Donovan Frankenreiter, Jasper, Dave Hidalgo (Los Lobos), Blackalicious, Marc Broussard, Tristan Prettyman and Jack Johnson on a fourteen song celebration of his iconic career. 
<P>
The tradition of the hip-hop blues has always been to rip open the heart and bare the soul. Tell the listener what they want to hear and you'll have a fair weather friend; tell them the way it is and you'll have true love. Thankfully, the Love is Alive, for G. delivers his loping lilt with bone humming honesty and he's never sounded so clear. From the swarming infectious grooves of Ride, Ain't That Right, and Holla! to the laid down easy of Breakin Up, Still Hanging Around, and Missing My Baby G. and The Sauce dance with the muses of their mentors, John Hammond, Bob Dylan, Jimmy Reed, De La Soul without ever missing the beat of their own signature time. 
<P>
Pepper this with the mercury simmer of Hot Cookin' with Frankenreiter, the idyllic warmth of Rainbow with Johnson, the aching duet of Beautiful with Prettyman and the handclapping hallelujah of Let the Music Play with Harper and Broussard you're left with the pure sound of summer ringing in your ear. 
<P>
As G. says of all the collaborations, We just reached out to a lot of our friends who just happen to be incredible musicians, and everyone was pretty enthusiastic about coming into the studio with us. So while the record maintains a real G. Love feel, it was a real group effort. Especially on Let the Music Play, I mean Ben and Marc just came down and demolished this track. We cut the rhythm track but left it wide open. So Bens comes through town and he's just on fire. He wrote his verse on the spot, whipped up this tight Wurlitzer part and played a crazy slide guitar solo throughout the whole thing. I already had a chorus together, but he added this gospel style by stacking his vocals a bit which caught the vibe. To top it off I wanted to have Broussard sing some harmony on it, but once in the studio he wanted to try out one of the verses. I asked him if he thought he could do it and he says in his real New Orleans gruff voice, you think I came down here to suck, man? Well okay. Watch out, I mean I never appreciated what an incredible vocalist he is until he just went in, put his church on it and crushed it. To have Ben and Marc, who both come at music from such a soulful way, on the same track was simply epic. 
<P>
Even though G. is an insatiable musical omnivore when it comes to feeding off influences, Lemonade is his most stylistically cohesive and focused album yet. Grown out of the somewhat dark tension of The Electric Mile (2001) and the ass bumping smorgasbord of The Hustle (2004), Lemonade's overall kickback beat begs the listener to blow out the speakers in musical reaffirmation. Free perhaps its deepest and most powerful track pulls the continuity string through it all, for its positive examination of the cycle of rebirth through a persons life backed with a Fixin' to Die blues beat perfectly captures the sweat your funk out, soul searchin, dust ridden road warriors G. Love and Special Sauce have come to embody. <P>

I'm in a real comfortable place musically and in my life; I'm cruisin right now and it feels good. So when I set out to make this record, I wanted to take my sound, base it on the groove and really get into a deeper pocket. Lyrically, I wanted to talk about what I always talk about finding love, making love, losing love, life and lemonade. 
<P>
Yes indeed, what you hold in your hands is pure, fresh, organic, summer sound. So go ahead, scratch it, sniff it, squeeze it, bite it until its juices slide down your elbows and leave you satisfied.

Melvin Seals & JGB are touring this summer in 2006 as Keepers of the Flame. Melvin has assembled a talented group of stellar musicians to help carry on Jerry Garcia's timeless music and elevate the listener to new heights of karmic nirvana! <P>

As a true Tribute to Jerry, Melvin Seals & JGB will perform all original material of the Jerry Garcia Band and when the audience closes their eyes they will be transcended into Jerry's past. When you see one of their concerts, you will know that Jerry Garcia's baton certainly has been passed... 
<P>
From blues to funk to rock, Melvin Seals and JGB serves up a tasty mix with a little R&B and gospel thrown in to spice things up. Each member of this powerhouse lineup brings an intuitive, expressive style, soul, spontaneity and remarkable chops to the table. With acoustic and electric ingredients and unique combinations of guitar, savory bass, hearty drums and, of course, a heapin' helpin' of the wizard's magic on Hammond B-3 Organ and keyboards, the result is a most satisfying blend of natural organic grooves that challenges genre boundaries. Their chemistry is the focus from which they create a spontaneous and high art where the sky is the limit musically. They offer an exciting, often psychedelic musical journey that keeps audiences dancing and smiling (and some staring in amazement) for several hours. Melvin is pioneering a path deeper into the musical territory he helped to establish. 
<P>
Melvin Seals & JGB performances are a must see, must feel experience!!! Their music is guaranteed to get into your soul, raise your spirit and get you groovin'!!!

Seth Bernard and May Erlewine bring their rare blend socially conscious music that swings, rocks, and grooves to Six Rivers Brewery Wednesday, March 10th for a FREE show  
<P>

"From a farm in Lake City, Michigan, come May Erlewine and Seth Bernard, young songwriters with commitment and more than a bit of charm. Performing together, they make music that feels intimate and genuine, as if you've been invited into their living room to listen."  -The Ark

<P>

Michigan has, for some time now, been a deep resource for songwriters and roots musicians. Two favorites, Seth Bernard and "Daisy" May Erlewine, well-known to audiences as single acts, have been performing and recording together for almost six years. Before they teamed up, they each paid their dues traveling across the land playing their music and sharing stories with everyone they met. Now, they are in constant demand playing festivals all over the country and at venerable folk institutions such as the Ark in Ann Arbor and Garrison Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion".
<P>
Already seasoned songwriters with five solo records each and two duo albums to their names, Seth and May draw from a deep well of American folk, country, blues and soul music. May Erlewine plays guitar and violin and is a songbird reminiscent of Patsy Cline and Patty Griffin. Her songs have been recorded by artists across the
country and sung in schools and places of worship. Samuel Seth Bernard has drawn comparisons to Woody Guthrie and Neil Young as a shape shifting folk rocker, community organizer, and communicator of ideas. 
<P>
They harmonize their voices and instruments beautifully, believing music can bring people together and proving so at every performance. Like all the best folk musicians, they have the ability to get everyone's attention and still a room. With their band, they can captivate and electrify an audience and ignite a dance floor. Seth and May's common belief in music to strengthen communities and to be a part of positive change has led to collaborations with numerous schools, farms and non-profit organizations. They partnered
with best selling author and famed environemtalist Bill McKibben and contributed songs to the www.350.org movement for Climate Change action. 
<P>
They have also fostered the creation of the Water Festival, a series of events in the Great Lakes region dedicated to music and education about preserving water quality and universal access. The best way to find out what Seth and May are about is to listen to their music, either at www.earthworlanusic.com. or better yet in person.

"Its completely different, but just amazing. Its its own kind of music. Malcolm (Papa Mali) is a real New Orleans guy and he has that feeling." - Bill Kreutzmann

<P>

Legendary drummer and co-founder of the Grateful Dead, Bill Kreutzmann, (who played every show in the bands illustrious 30 year career as well as The Dead incarnations since) first met funky bluesman and voodoo electronic pioneer Papa Mali at a festival in 2008. Bill recalls in a recent interview, We first met at the Oregon Country Fair last year. He was the headliner on the main stage, and I sat there and watched him and went, This guy's for real man, I like this guy.' Then we met, after that he came over to my trailer that I was staying in and you couldn't separate us, we talked for hours. It was just one of those natural things, you know? You can't plan it, you can't make it happen. And then we started playing together. Since that meeting the band has played numerous shows including shows in Oahu and Maui for Halloween, a New Years Eve run in Maui, a Midwest festival tour, Austin City Limits Festival and numerous other events.
<P>
Bill and Papa recently entered a studio in Austin and recorded a new CD featuring bass virtuoso Reed Mathis (Tea Leaf Green, JFJO) and multi-instrumentalist Matt Hubbard (Willie Nelson and Friends). Reed and Papa first shared the stage in 2008 during a string of Mardi Gras shows in Colorado called The Big Easy Blowout which raised thousands of dollars for both the New Orleans Musicians Clinic and Tipitinas Foundation and also featured Page McConnell (Phish), Russell Batiste (Funky Meters, PBS), Big Chief Monk Boudreaux (Wild Magnolias, Golden Eagles) and many others. The synergy between the two was immediate and powerful. Matt Hubbard joined Bill and Papa for their last several tours and adds his unique flavor to every tune. Together they will rock a mighty sound that will incorporate several tunes from the Grateful Dead repertoire, Papa Mali originals, some New Orleans and Southern songbook interpretations and a brand new batch of Robert Hunter (Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan lyricist) originals that were co-written with Papa Mali. The CD is expected to be released in early 2010 and will be touring heavily to support the new music.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">CenterArts presents The David Grisman Quintet on Saturday May 8, 2010 at 8 p.m. in the Van Duzer Theatre, HSU. Tickets are $35 general, $30 Senior/Child and $25 HSU students. Tickets are available at the Works in Arcata and Eureka, University Ticket Office at HSU or at centerarts.humboldt.edu. 
<P>

For over 40 years, mandolinist David Grisman has been busy creating dawg music, a blend of multiple stylistic influences, including swing, bluegrass, Latin, jazz and gypsy so unique he gave it its own name. In doing so, David has inspired a whole new genre of acoustic string instrumental music--earning a reputation for unsurpassed style and virtuosity and creating a niche for himself in the world of contemporary music. <P>


Once dubbed The Paganini of the Mandolin by The New York Times, David has been praised for his mastery of the instrument as well as his talents as a composer, bandleader, teacher and record producer. After making many records for several major labels, David founded his own company, Acoustic Disc. After launching the label, David entered into perhaps the most prolific period of his long, distinguished career; in the last nine years, he has produced 50 critically acclaimed, high quality recordings of acoustic music (five of which have been nominated for Grammy awards). 
<P>

Acoustic Disc has been a vehicle for David to pursue interests in other genres as well. A steady stream of premier musicians, including the Doc Watson, Tony Rice and Martin Taylor have recorded for Acoustic Disc in Dawg Studios. David's old friend, the late Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead (who gave David the nickname Dawg) frequently unplugged at Dawg Studios, exploring with David a shared love of traditional folk, bluegrass, jazz and popular music. Together, they collaborated on four Acoustic Disc releases--the Grammy-nominated Garcia/Grisman Not For Kids Only, a notable American Library Association recording Shady Grove, a collection of unreleased material focusing on traditional ballads and songs and the jazz compilation So What. 
<P>

David's unique instrumental music came together in the early 1970's when he formed the Great American Music Band with fiddler Richard Greene. Nothing against singers, said David, but it became apparent to me that I could play 90 minutes without one. Besides...Elvis never called. Greene moved on, and David met up with guitar phenomenon Tony Rice, who moved to California where they started rehearsing a new group, the David Grisman Quintet. The rest is part of string band history.  

<P>
Over the past two decades, the DGQ has won numerous polls and awards and has headlined at jazz, folk and bluegrass festivals around the world. David Grismans bands in their various quartet and quintet configurations have showcased acoustic music ever since he started the first DGQ in the fall of 1975. Ever since then, the DGQ has been the leading force in establishing his new genre of instrumental acoustic string music. 
<P>

Through the years, the DGQ has been a breeding ground for new acoustic talent. Band alumni includes Mark OConnor and Darol Anger of the Turtle Island String Quartet. Grismans bands have also had a strong impact on the new generation of musicians, like banjo phenomenon Bela Fleck who saw a traditional bluegrass instrument like the Mandolin being taken beyond the bounds of one idiom. 

<P>
David Grisman has always been a pioneer. He has deeply influenced several generations of musicians through his own musical explorations, and with the blossoming success of Acoustic Disc has helped make artist-owned independent labels a viable force in the modern music business.

"We got tighter and we got better. We got away from just having two drummers playing the same thing. That never works. It doesnt make it a better sound, to have two identical drummers playing.

The Rhythm Devils began as the duo of Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and his percussionist partner Mickey Hart.  Over the years, they transcended rock and roll drum stereotypes with polyrhythmic explorations of the world of percussion, using an extraordinary variety of instruments and approaches.  The aftermath of this collaboration was the larger Rhythm Devils, which have made periodic reappearances over the years with many different musicians adding texture and flavor to the mix. Some of these musicians include Mike Gordon, Steve Kimock, Jen Durkin and more.
The 2010 version includes Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, Keller Williams (guitar, vocals), Davy Knowles (guitar, vocals), Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum),  and Andy Hess (bass).  Together, they will take music beyond the horizon to a universe where rhythm is in constant flux and sound has infinite potential.  Theyll rock.

It may be true.

<p>
The rumour is, according to family, that Jerry has absconded with various items from a fellow musician.
<p>
No complaints from the musician, however.
<p>
It might be because the musician, Norm Copperman, has passed away.
<p>
The complaint is that someone has broken into Norm's house since his passing and stolen many items including a car, a keyboard, a computer, a bass, and several pots and pans. 
<p>
The family has requested that the items be returned. They have also contacted the local authorities and they are told to be in hot pursuit.
<p>
Norm Copperman was a world class jazz musician. He does not deserve this treatment.
<p>
Whatever treatment the abscondivant gets is well deserved.

Oh, by the way, many of the stolen items from Norm's house were found at Jerry Thompson's house.

Coincidence?

Update - July 13 - Jerry is in jail awaiting his fate. Arrested last week, police found not only the aforementioned items but Norm's car and a washer/dryer combo at Jerry's house.

Born Claude Russell Bridges on April 2, 1942, in Lawton, OK, he began studying classical piano at age three, a decade later adopting the trumpet and forming his first band. At 14, Russell lied about his age to land a gig at a Tulsa nightclub, playing behind Ronnie Hawkins & the Hawks before touring in support of Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, he settled in Los Angeles, studying guitar under the legendary James Burton and appearing on sessions with Dorsey Burnette and Glen Campbell. As a member of Spector's renowned studio group, Russell played on many of the finest pop singles of the 1960s, also arranging classics like Ike & Tina Turner's monumental "River Deep, Mountain High"; other hits bearing his input include the Byrds' "Mr. Tambourine Man," Gary Lewis & the Playboys' "This Diamond Ring," and Herb Alpert's "A Taste of Honey."
In 1967, Russell built his own recording studio, teaming with guitarist Marc Benno to record the acclaimed Look Inside the Asylum Choir LP. While touring with Delaney & Bonnie, he scored his first songwriting hit with Joe Cocker's reading of "Delta Lady," and in 1970, upon founding his own Shelter Records imprint, he also organized Cocker's legendary Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour. After the subsequent tour film earned Russell his first real mainstream notoriety, he issued a self-titled solo LP, and in 1971 appeared at George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh following sessions for B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and Bob Dylan. After touring with the Rolling Stones, Russell increasingly focused on his solo career, reaching the number two spot with 1972's Carney and scoring his first pop hit with the single "Tight Rope." While the success of 1973's three-LP set Leon Live further established his reputation as a top concert draw, response to the country-inspired studio effort Hank Wilson's Back was considerably more lukewarm, as was the reception afforded to 1974's Stop All That Jazz. 1975's Will O' the Wisp, however, restored his commercial luster, thanks in large part to the lovely single "Lady Blue." 
In June of 1975, Russell married singer Mary McCreary; the following year the couple collaborated on The Wedding Album, issued through his newly formed Paradise Records label. Also in 1976, the Russell-penned "This Masquerade" earned a Grammy Award for singer George Benson. He and McCreary reunited for 1977's Make Love to the Music, and upon completing the solo Americana, Russell teamed with Willie Nelson for 1979's Willie & Leon. He then spent the next two years touring with his bluegrass band, the New Grass Revival, issuing a live LP in 1981; although Paradise shut down later that year, the label was reactivated for 1984's Hank Wilson, Vol. 2 and Solid State. Russell spent the remainder of the decade largely outside of music and did not resurface until issuing the Bruce Hornsby-produced Anything Can Happen in 1992. The album appeared to little fanfare, however, and another long period of relative inactivity followed prior to the 1998 release of Hank Wilson, Vol. 3: Legend in My Time. Face in the Crowd appeared a year later. Moving into the new century, Russell issued Moonlight & Love Songs, an album of cover songs, in 2002, followed by Angel in Disguise five years later in 2007. A trio of releases, Almost Piano, Bad Country, and In Your Dreams, appeared in 2008.

Samuel Seth Bernard and May Erlewine are a pair of Michigan-based contemporary folk performers who have recorded and performed extensively both as a duo and as solo artists. Both born and raised in Michigan to musical families with a firm independent streak, Bernard and Erlewine first met in 2003, when he was a performer at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival (using the name Seth Barnard) and she was attending. Both Bernard and Erlewine had a strong background in songwriting and performing and had tastes that ran from folk and blues to rock, and they soon became partners in music (and later a couple). In 2003, Erlewine (as Daisy May, a nickname she'd had since childhood) cut her first album for Earthwork Music, the independent label affiliated with his family's collective farm that had already released two discs by Bernard. In early 2006, they released their first collaborative LP through Earthwork, simply called Seth Bernard and Daisy May, which followed several years of live performances as a duo. Along with other artists affiliated with the Earthwork Collective, Bernard and Erlewine were perennial attractions at the farm's annual Harvest Gathering, a music festival devoted to local independent artists and responsible, earth-friendly activism. Bernard and Erlewine have also been part of the musical and environmental activist community in the Midwest, and have taken their message across the country and beyond the U.S. border, participating in educational workshops with native musicians in Mexico in 2008. <P>

In 2009, Erlewine opted to stop calling herself Daisy May in favor of May Erlewine, and Bernard embraced his birth name, Samuel Seth Bernard, and they used their new/old names for their second collaborative album, Welcome Back. 2010 is proving to be  really exciting, releasing new albums this month! 
<P>
Seth will be releasing his new solo album Is This you?, a companion piece to his album This Here. Is This You takes you on a deep journey enriching the songs from This Here with seven new songs. The album was recorded in Michigan at the heart center studio and features an amazing cast of musicians. 
<P>
May Erlewine will be releasing her 5th solo project titled golden. The album was recorded at Earthwork Farm in October, 2009. A new collection of songs recorded with her dearest friends at home. Soup was on the stove and the amps were in the kitchen! <P>
Already seasoned songwriters with five solo records each and two duo albums to their names, Seth and May draw from a deep well of American folk, country, blues and soul music. May Erlewine plays guitar and violin and is a songbird reminiscent of Patsy Cline and Patty Griffin. Her songs have been recorded by artists across the
country and sung in schools and places of worship. Samuel Seth Bernard has drawn comparisons to Woody Guthrie and Neil Young as a shape shifting folk rocker, community organizer, and communicator of ideas. 
<P>
They harmonize their voices and instruments beautifully, believing music can bring people together and proving so at every performance. Like all the best folk musicians, they have the ability to get everyone's attention and still a room. With their band, they can captivate and electrify an audience and ignite a dance floor. Seth and May's common belief in music to strengthen communities and to be a part of positive change has led to collaborations with numerous schools, farms and non-profit organizations. They partnered
with best selling author and famed environemtalist Bill McKibben and contributed songs to the www.350.org movement for Climate Change action. 
<P>
They have also fostered the creation of the Water Festival, a series of events in the Great Lakes region dedicated to music and education about preserving water quality and universal access. The best way to find out what Seth and May are about is to listen to their music, either at www.earthworkmusic.com. or better yet in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

The Rhythm Devils began as the duo of Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and his percussionist partner Mickey Hart.  Over the years, they transcended rock and roll drum stereotypes with polyrhythmic explorations of the world of percussion, using an extraordinary variety of instruments and approaches.  The aftermath of this collaboration was the larger Rhythm Devils, which have made periodic reappearances over the years with many different musicians adding texture and flavor to the mix. Some of these musicians include Mike Gordon, Steve Kimock, Jen Durkin and more.
The 2010 version includes Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, Keller Williams (guitar, vocals), Davy Knowles (guitar, vocals), Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum),  and Andy Hess (bass).  Together, they will take music beyond the horizon to a universe where rhythm is in constant flux and sound has infinite potential.  Theyll rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">DATE: MONDAY AUGUST 16 <P>
EVENT: DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND<P>
VENUE: RED FOX TAVERN  415 5th street Eureka, CA<P>
DETAILS: $25 , 21+, Doors 9:00pm/ Show 10:00pm<P>
In 1977, the Dirty Dozen Social and Pleasure Club in New Orleans began showcasing a traditional Crescent City brass band. It was a joining of two proud, but antiquated, traditions at the time: social and pleasure clubs dated back over a century to a time when black southerners could rarely afford life insurance, and the clubs would provide proper funeral arrangements. Brass bands, early predecessors of jazz as we know it, would often follow the funeral procession playing somber dirges, then once the family of the deceased was out of earshot, burst into jubilant dance tunes as casual onlookers danced in the streets. By the late '70s, few of either existed. The Dirty Dozen Social and Pleasure Club decided to assemble this group as a house band, and over the course of these early gigs, the seven-member ensemble adopted the venue's name: the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. <P>
Thirty years later, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band is a world famous music machine, whose name is synonymous with genre-bending romps and high-octane performances. They have revitalized the brass band in New Orleans and around the world, progressing from local parties, clubs, baseball games and festivals in their early years to touring nearly constantly in the U.S. and in over 30 other countries on five continents. The Dirty Dozen have been featured guests on albums by artists including David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Dr. John and the Black Crowes. <P>
The Dirty Dozen has been up for big challenges in the past with its bracing, innovative blend of traditional New Orleans sounds and modern jazz sensibilities.  The ensemble has recorded with artists from Dizzy Gillespie (a hero and inspiration) to Elvis Costello, taken on the music of jazz inventor Jelly Roll Morton for the album Jelly and reinterpreted the hymns and parade songs of the Crescent City second-line bands for 2004's Funeral For A Friend (following the death of co-founding member Tuba Fats).  They've mixed intriguing approaches to traditional and familiar material, but in a context emphasizing challenging original music composed by the Dozen members themselves.  In the course, the band resurrected, revitalized and put distinctly personal stamps on what was a dying tradition of New Orleans brass bands when the group formed in the late '70s, inspiring a full-on revival that's flourished with several new generations of young brass bands each bringing their own twists to the form.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

If you have yet to encounter the Brooklyn-based band, The Pimps of Joytime, prepare to take a funky ride! The PJTs live events and recordings have captivated fans all across the country, as they have begun writing their own success story, show by show, and track by track. 
<P>
Bandleader Brian J is a charismatic and soulful visionary, whose well-crafted songs invite the listener to enter a world of infectious dance grooves and indelible melodies. Spending formative years in New York City, New Orleans and Los Angeles, Mista J honed his craft, becoming an accomplished live performer, multi-instrumentalist and producer. 
<P>
In 2005, Brian began to assemble a group of righteously soulful vocalists and musicians to assist in bringing to life the musical concept that would become The Pimps of Joytime. The band's diverse sound and spirited attitude is strongly influenced by the Brooklyn DJ culture and live music scene from which they emerge. Recent collaborations with legendary artists Cyril and Art Neville of the Neville Brothers and Roy Ayers have helped vitalize the band's connection to its roots. 
<P>
Over the course of the past four years, The Pimps have evolved into a road tested and audience approved groove machine. They have excited crowds at over 100 club dates and festivals in 2009 alone, and are on target to exceed that volume in 2010. The exponential growth of the band's fan base can be partially attributed to an artful blend of musical styles, including elements of afrobeat, salsa, rock & roll and electronica. Brian J's classic songwriting and the band's undeniable swagger on stage consistently energizes dance parties wherever they appear. 
<P>
In 2008, with their first studio album and a remix album released through the boutique label Wonderwheel Recordings, The Pimps of Joytime were prepared to take their career to the highest level. With a steadily increasing repertoire and a passionate following of music lovers in NYC and San Francisco, the time was right to fortify their organization. After seeing the band live, Jesse Aratow of the North American booking agency Madison House signed them on the spot. 
<P>
The Pimps now has a significant following in other key markets such as, LA, DC, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Portland and New Orleans. The wall of their Facebook page is constantly receiving enthusiastic posts from fans across the USA as word of mouth further carries news of this fresh new arrival. <P>

The Pimps of Joytime are poised to bring their audacious sound to savvy audiences around the planet. Their forthcoming album, Janxta Funk! is a new chapter in the book of the Funk and a testament to the fact that real music is alive and kicking! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

These United States surrender themselves to unbridled rock and roll exuberance: ringing guitars, thundering drums, desperate yearning bordering on hope.  By turns larger-than-life and disarmingly intimate, this is folk in the truest sense - a record of the moment, of the cultural and emotional forces that animate everyday existence somewhere down below the headlines.  (But never apart from them.)  And These United States play it the way folk was meant to be played: hard, fast, big, slow, long, loud, loose, at last unburdened. They play like they mean it.  Like there's never been a better time to be alive.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">DATE: FRIDAY  OCTOBER  8  <P>
EVENT: TRAINWRECK <P>
VENUE: RED FOX TAVERN  415 5th street Eureka, CA<P>
DETAILS: $15, 21+, Doors 9:00pm/ show 10:30pm<P>
Trainwreck has been described by founder Kyle Gass as a cornucopia of rock and a 5-headed hydra of pleasure. Truer words were never spoken. Over the years, the Wreck has dirt-farmed a sound that lies somewhere in the realm of Southern Rock, but with plenty of forays into Prog-Rock, Boogie, and straight-up Classic Rock and Roll, as well as absurdist comedy banter and lyrics derived from the characters theyve developed within the band. Always an unforgettable time, their shows have earned them fans all of over the globe, headlining venues in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. As a support act theyve primed fans for sets by The Reverend Horton Heat, Vida Blue (Page from Phish), and Blues Traveler. The Wreck has also performed on The Jimmie Kimmel Show, and done guest spots for Current TV.
<P>
In late 2009 they released their long-awaited and much-hyped debut album, The Wreckoning.
<P>

15 tracks of what they call Wreck and Roll. Its a sound all their own, cultivated from their influences, steeped heavily in the classics, and modified with their own unique set of talents. Fronted by biker-hayseed Darryl Donald (Lee of Tenacious D, or JR), and Kyle Gass (aka Klip Calhoun), and containing most of Tenacious Ds live/studio band (John Shredman, Boy Johnny, and Dallas St. Bernard), expect to see Trainwreck in your town in 2010 as they conquer the earth in support of The Wreckoning, and leave in their wake melted faces, busted ear-fannies, and the occasional bastard child.
<P>
The Wreckoning is nothing short of a Trainwreck, in the best possible way, said John Barthomew Shredman of Trainwreck. After seven years of playing music together, touring all over the world, and recording a number of live albums and EP's we finally decided it was time to release our full-length debut. We cannot wait to see all of you on the road in the coming month. So keep your ear-fannies wide and your butt-flaps wider because we're about to ram this train into places you didn't know it could go. Prepareth yourselves!<P>
The Wreckoning is Trainwrecks latest 15-song release that features instant classics such as Milk The Cobra, Bothered & Hot and El Mustachio. All tracks highlight the bands par-tay credo. Case in point, the video for Brodeo, a tale of man-on-man bonding could very well be the band's manthem. Lyrics touch on the finer points of beer pong, chips and dip and lots of energetic men taking their shirts off at a pool party sans chicks. Its a visual Broverload to be sure. <P>

Since forming in the late '90s, the musically muscular and relentlessly inventive Umphrey's McGee has cultivated an impressive presence both live and in the studio. Lauded by critics and adored by fans, the band continues to draw in new listeners with their singular style: virtuoso playing and acrobatic tempo changes and rhythmic shifts complemented by dazzling song craft and composition, memorable hooks, anthemic guitar lines and rock solid rhythms.
<P>
Now in their second decade, Umphreys McGee continues to wow fans globally.  The band has performed at festivals such as U.S. festivals as Bonnaroo, ROTHBURY, and Lollapalooza, have toured Europe multiple times and performed Japans Fuji Rock Festival.
<P>
Umphreys McGee is also known for their innovative approach to distributing music and building community. With the recent unveiling of Umphreys McGees all-new Stew Art Series (aka, S2)  an interactive fan experience where audience members conduct the bands live improvisations  - Umphreys McGee continue to offer their fiercely loyal fanbase the most innovative musical experiences available. Before their latest studio recording, Mantis, was released in January of last year, the group made the album available for pre-order in an interesting way. Fans were offered more free bonus content the more Mantis pre-orders were received; as the fans unlocked levels of content by getting more of their friends to pre-order the album. The idea was to give the fans incentive to help spread the word about the album, and to offer a totally unique music experience. As Umphreys McGees sound evolves with every passing show, the live concerts sold on their expansive music archive site UMLive.net continue to be in high demand by their hungry fan base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

Bummerfest was started by members of Panache Magazine and the Placebo Collective in 2001 to celebrate local bands who were not into playing in the sun on the river- and to poke fun at another music festival with a similar sounding name. It evolved into an annual celebration of the local music scene and the friendships and creativity it sparks.  2006, the last year Bummerfest was held, was a commemoration of the life and death of  Robb Rierdan, one of the event founders. Since then, several of the key Placebo members have moved away or moved on to other projects. But no one has ever forgotten Bummerfest. <P>
This year, the all ages rock extravaganza is being headed by long time Placebo volunteers and alumni Renee Davis,Devon O'Leary, and friends. Davis has been coming to Placebo events regulary for 10 years, displayed her paintings and art at Placebo shows, and has  volunteering intermittently. O'Leary is a former Placebo Board member who has played his share of Placebo shows -Professional Superheroes and other bands and whose current band, Killbot Factory, is featured in this years lineup. We're hoping this will build the scene back up, says Devon O'Leary,  There has been a lull in the scene with the lack of a permanent all ages venue. Rene Davis adds,  The Placebo has shaped my creativity  I hung my pictures there and it's been key to  many of the friendships I've forged over the years. 

<P>Proceeds from Bummerfest will benefit the all ages Placebo collective which has been venueless since the January 9th, 2010 earthquake severely damaged the Ink People's 411 12th Street Headquarters.  A portion of the proceeds will also go to the Y.S.B. RAVEN Project, which serves homeless and at risk youth and has partnered with Placebo in the past to empower and entertain local youth. 
Advance tickets available for $10.00  at The Works in Arcata & Eureka, Missing Link Records, and other local record stores.  Tickets are $15.00 at the door. <P>

EVENT: LES NUBIANS<P>
VENUE: RED FOX TAVERN  415 5th street Eureka, CA<P>
DETAILS: $20 ADV./ $25 DOOR,  21+,  Doors 9:00pm/ Show 10:30pm<P>
Music is every moment of our lives, says Helene FAUSSART, one half of the Afropean hip hop/R&B duo Les Nubians. 
<P>
Helene and her sister/bandmate, Celia, found that this feeling connected them with people in Jamaica, EGYPT, Cameroon, Chad, London, their native Paris and other locales around the world as they embarked on the journey that led to their newest album 'One Step Forward.'
<P>
In the time since their 1999 U.S. debut 'Princesses Nubiennes' (Higher Octave/Virgin) became the most successful French-language album in more than a decade of Billboard charts, Les Nubians' singing sisters have traveled the world, soaking up the sounds of reggae, afro-beat, pop and electronica while collaborating with a host of respected musicians. 
<P>
Everywhere we went, we looked for music that spoke of the local culture, says Helene. The sisters met and worked with traditional folk musicians, as well as artists at the apex of every genre from Afro-jazz to British breakbeat to Cameroonian hip hop. In addition to working on their own material, Les Nubians appeared on 14 different recordings by an assortment of other artists, spanning the globe and crossing genres - from Towa Tei, Black Eyed Peas and Talib Kweli & Hi-Tek to the acclaimed Red Hot series on Red, Hot & Riot and Red, Hot & Indigo. The musical summits gave way to recording sessions in Jamaica, Cameroon, London and at home in Paris, where Helene and Celia were joined by African jazz legend Manu Dibango, pianist Ray Lema, classical musician Benjamin Biolay, dancehall reggae stars Morgan Heritage, UK electronica wizard I.G. Culture, Mounir Belkhir, the poetic producer of the US hit track Makeda and more. For Les Nubians, these diverse sessions were a chance to work with some of their biggest influences, while bringing together the music of a wide range of cultures and generations.<P>

Along with learning from these master instrumentalists, Celia and Helene sought to preserve their legacies among younger listeners. This is so important, especially in Afropean music, says Helene. Many of the sounds of the two cultures have been separated for so long, but music can be a bridge that helps people meet. Multi-cultural sensibilities come naturally to Les Nubians. Born to a French father and Cameroonian mother, Helene and Celia learned how to sing at a young age. Inspired by a backstage meeting with jazz singer Abbey Lincoln (who encouraged them to do it-the greatest thing in the world is to be a singer!), the group pursued their music relentlessly. Their debut Princesses Nubiennes was a successful amalgam of the music they'd experienced during their life travels, combining their African roots with jazzy nuances, funky rhythms and a hint of British soul, all delivered in their uniquely elegant French style. A long and varied list of musical influences are attributed to Les Nubians' distinctive sound, including Miriam Makeba, Ella Fitzgerald, the Fugees, Fela Kuti, and Jazzie B of Soul II Soul According to Celia, Music is a great way to transmit a cultural background.
<P>
Making this record was, in part, a way for our generation to give tribute to musicians we've looked up to and see that their music gets the recognition it deserves.
<P>
Les Nubians were nominated for the 2004 Grammy Awards in the Best urban alternative R&B category, along with Erykah Badu, Outkast, Music Soulchild and Khelis. Les Nubians are now touring and visiting new countries and territories ready to catch their afropean flavour.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">The New Riders of the Purple Sage, signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis, released its
eponymous first album in September 1971 to widespread acclaim.  In the next 11 years the band
toured and released over 12 albums, selling over 4 million records.  NRPS began as a part-time
spin-off from the Grateful Dead when Jerry Garcia (pedal steel guitar), Phil Lesh (bass) and Mickey
Hart (drums) teamed up with John Dawson (guitar, vocals) and David Nelson (guitar).  Although
early live appearances were viewed as an informal warm-up to the main attraction, the group
quickly established an independent identity through the strength of Dawson's original songs.  By
1970 Dave Torbert had replaced Lesh, and Spencer Dryden, formerly of Jefferson Airplane, had
joined as the group's permanent drummer.  Garcia remained in both The Dead and The New
Riders until he found himself overcommitted, at which time Buddy Cage replaced him and the
classic NRPS lineup was born. Original NRPS bass player Dave Torbert and drummer Spencer
Dryden have passed away, co-founder John Dawson Passed away in 2009 due to ongoing health
problems. His considerable talents will be missed but his songs and musical legacy will live on. 
Before he passed he had given his blessing and was excited to know his music is being heard live
again by a whole new generation of fans. The new lineup vows to keep the NRPS spirit and tunes
alive by taking them to fans everywhere. The band recently teamed up with Grateful Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter and released it's first CD in twenty years to rave reviews, Where I Come From
(Woodstock Records).

 David Nelson has managed the seemingly impossible. He has remained true to his musical vision
and integrity without becoming outdated or archaic in the process. Nelson, an important figure
in the musical vanguard of the influential Haight-Ashbury music scene, spawned the Grateful
Dead. His ties to Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter extend beyond that with The Wildwood Boys, a
bluegrass band they formed together in 1962 in Palo Alto, CA. After the Dead got together, Nelson
played guitar on three pivotal albums, Aoxomoxoa, Workingman's Dead and American Beauty.
Around the same time, Garcia bought a pedal steel guitar, which he enjoyed playing with John
Dawson, a friend from the Palo Alto days. They formed the New Riders of the Purple Sage with
Nelson and the Dead's Mickey Hart and Phil Lesh. Nelson who sang one of New Rider's biggest
hits, a cover of bluegrass great Peter Rowan's "Panama Red," stayed with the group for 13 years,
but left in 1982 and starting writing songs with longtime pal Robert Hunter, among others. Along
the way, he was a member of the Good Ol' Boys, featuring bluegrass legends Don Reno, Chubby
Wise and Frank Wakefield. He also played in the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band and is featured on
their 1988 album, "Almost Acoustic." Then in 1994, Nelson formed the David Nelson Band where
he showcased his plethora of songs. In six years, DNB released four CDs. Three are live efforts:
1995's Limited Edition, 1997's Keeper of the Key, and 1999's High Adventure in Japan, which is
also a concert video. In 1999 Nelson released the band's studio debut, Visions Under the Moon
which was recorded in Portland, OR's Aladdin Theater. Things have come full circle with Nelson at
the helm of The New Riders.

Not only has Buddy Cage sold over four million records in his ten years with the NRPS, but he has
also performed on many gold and platinum albums during his distinguished career including Blood
On The Tracks (Dylan), Biograph (Dylan), The Official Bootleg Tapes (Dylan) and various releases
with Ann Murray.  Cage has also recorded with Grateful Dead Members Garcia, Weir and Hart
as well as with Dead lyricist Robert Hunter (on Tales of the Rum Runners); Ian and Sylvia (Great
Speckled Bird, the seminal folk band of which Cage was a member); John Cipollina (Quick Silver
Messenger Service); Mario Cipollina (Huey Lewis and The News); Rick James; Rick Danko and
Garth Hudson (The Band); David Rea (Fairport Convention and Mountain); The Shondells; David
Bromberg (with Bonnie Raitt); Pappa John Creach (Hot Tuna); Sly Stone; and Vassar Clements, to
name a few.  No stranger to TV, Cage has appeared on numerous shows and specials from Della
Reese, Joey Bishop and Mike Douglas to Richie Havens, Seals & Croft, Willie Nelson, Johnny
Cash (Grand Ole Opry), Don Kirschner's In Concert & Rock Concert series and the Midnight
Special shows hosted by Wolfman Jack. Most recently Buddy can be heard on his show on Sirus
Satellite Radio, Jam On  (channel 17) from 6 to midnight Monday through Friday

Guitarist/singer/songwriter Michael Falzarano, a member of NRPS since 2005, has previously
been a member of Hot Tuna, the famed offspring of The Jefferson Airplane, and The Memphis
Pilgrims, a Memphis-style rock n roll/blues band that he founded.  Falzarano's current release
is a solo project entitled We Are All One on Woodstock Records and features Vassar Clements,
Melvin Seals, Jorma Kaukonen, Garth Hudson, Buddy Cage and many others.  Previous releases
include The King James Sessions and Mecca.  He has toured extensively throughout the world
on shared billings with The Allman Brothers, Black Crowes, The Other Ones, Rusted Root, Bruce
Hornsby and Los Lobos, among others.  Falzarano has also appeared live or recorded with such
musical greats as Bob Weir (Grateful Dead); Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson (The
Band); John Lee Hooker; Johnny Copeland; Hubert Sumlin (Howlin Wolf); Vassar Clements;
Paul Simon; Dr. John; Graham Parker; Merl Saunders; Steve Kimok; Bill Keith; Warren Haynes

Ronnie Penque has been playing music for over 30 years.  When not working with NRPS or his
band RONNIE PENQUE BAND, which includes his brother Chris Penque on guitar, Ron is busy as
a session player. Ronnie started out as the original bass player in the popular Grateful Dead cover
band Ripple. Through the years Ron has also played with many other bands and great musicians
including Bobby Weir, Mickey Hart, Vassar Clements, Peter Rowan, Melvin Seals, Robert Hunter,
John Popper, Pete Sears, David Nelson, Barry Sless, Keller Wiliams, Donna Jean Godchaux,
Jeff Pevar, and Michael Falzarano.  After Ripple retired in 2003, Ron was asked by keyboardist
Melvin Seals of The Jerry Garcia Band to join his band, "Melvin Seals and JGB." A short time
after joining Melvin and JGB, NRPS drummer Johnny Markowski came on board and the two
developed a lock and key rhythmic feel on bass and drums that they brought to The New Riders.
If the name Penque is familiar, Ron's uncle the late Romeo Penque was one of the most famous
woodwind and flute players in the industry who was best known for his work with Miles Davis. At

age 12 Ronnie was taught to play bass by his father Ron Penque Sr., an accomplished session
bass player for 20 years, who gave Ronnie his 57 Precision bass (Dads Bass) upon his retirement.
Some of Ronnie's musical influences are The Grateful Deads Phil Lesh, NRPS bass player Dave
Torbert, Donald Duck Dunn, John Entwistle, Paul McCartney and Jack Casady, among others.

Johnny Markowski, an accomplished drummer, can be found playing his kit these days with The
New Riders of the Purple Sage. When not on the road with The NRPS, Johnny works with his
band, Stir Fried, and plays with various artists in many styles. Songwriting is also in his blood. 
His father, Thomas Jefferson Kaye, was a legendary producer and songwriter in the 1960s
and 1970s.  Markowskis band, Stir Fried, known for its blend of swamp groove, psychedelic
improvisational music performs signature versions of Kaye masterpieces in addition to Markowski
originals.  The group has recorded and performed with the likes of Dr. John, Vassar Clements
(Old & In The Way), Commander Cody, Buddy Cage (NRPS), Jo Jo Herman (Widespread Panic),
Bernie Worrell (P Funk, Talking Heads), Derek Trucks (Allman Bros. Band) and Tony Trischka.
Recently Jambands.com held a contest for the most impressive drummer/percussionist, and after
two weeks of voting Markowski won hands down, beating out some pretty heavy competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><br><div align="center"><img src="News/graphics/990.jpg" alt="NRPS at Humbrews Nov 28" border="0"></div></font>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Mark Karan is best known for performing with the extended Grateful Dead family.  For the last twelve years, he has anchored the lead guitar slot in Bob Weir & RatDog, playing hundreds of shows to thousands of fans year-round.  Before crossing over into the land of the Dead, Mark worked his guitar and vocal voodoo for the likes of Dave Mason, Delaney Bramlett, the Rembrandts, Paul Carrack, Huey Lewis, Jesse Colin Young and Sophie B. Hawkins.<P>

Mark also tours with an array of amazing musicians on his own, where his soulful blues-based vocal stylings and inspired guitar work meld with the remarkably creative and responsive playing of his friends in a passionate delivery of the psychedelicized sounds of Americana.

In addition to his originals, as well as those of songwriter friends, Mark covers a range of eclectic songs from Johnny "Guitar" Watson's "You Can Stay (But the Noize Must Go)" and Peter Tosh's "Don't Look Back", to the Kinks Lazin on a Sunny Afternoon or Joe Jacksons Fools in Love -- his unique musical taste and song choices are the hallmark of these shows, and always crowd pleasers for his nationwide, loyal fanbase.
<P>
Marks debut album, Walk Through the Fire was released in 2009 to critical acclaim, and features very special guests Delaney Bramlett, Bill Payne, Mike Finnigan, Pete Sears, John Molo, Hutch Hutchinson, The Persuasions, The Rowan Brothers, and many more.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Friday FEB. 18 LYRICS BORN Live at RED FOX TAVERN </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Amongst the dusty records of UC Davis KDVS college radio station, Tom Shimura, who currently makes records as Lyrics Born, found too much to love. Sandwiched between gatefold LPs, 12-inch singles, dub versions and white-labels was a reservoir of inspiration that he would draw on for the following decades. That was then. This is now. Since his college days, Bay Area-native Lyrics Borns raw, authentic talent has been polished to a gleaming beacon of originality in a time when its needed most, and its release marks a new era of label relations. The old model is dead, you cant just put it out and expect people to get it, explains LB, and the statement could easily be applied to his sound or his approach to marketing the finished product. 

Lyrics Born has gone about the creation of his latest effort, As U Were, in a less-than-conventional manner. One defining characteristic of his sound thus far has been that it can be described as unequivocally fun, and this remains true of As U Were. However, LB does routinely peel back the gregarious exterior to reveal a contemplative everyman, and its times like this that his true artistry is apparent. Its at the point in my career where Ive been through a lot, fun and not so fun. I think Im dealing with a lot issues that are more mature than the last few albums, from abandonment to betrayal to incredible joy. He voices these sentiments prominently on the lead single Lies x 3, a driving, heartfelt plead for truth. 

While touching on newer subjects, he also reached out to artists that he felt removed himself from his comfort zone. The new record is more synth-oriented. I made an effort to work with younger artists: Trackademicks, Francis and The Lights, and Sam Sparro, namely. The bay-swagger is in full effect on Funky Hit Records, and while the new guests add a new dimension to the sound, Tom Shimura isnt one to lose sight of his roots. Gift Of Gab drops a requisite, thought-provoking verse on the critical Pills and the classic Latyrx tag-team makes it look way too easy on Pushed Aside, Pulled Apart, one of the albums standout cuts. As U Were may well be LBs greatest achievement, but its been a long time coming. 

Lyrics Born had been a music obsessive since his youth, and in 1993 freestyles among a group of UC Davis classmates that occupied the same cramped radio quarters began to find their way onto paper, and suddenly LB had written Send Them. It became the first single on the newly minted Solesides Records, a collaborative venture between himself and his accomplices who would later go on to be known internationally as Blackalicious (comprised of MC Gift of Gab and producer Chief Xcel), DJ Shadow and Lateef The Truthspeaker, an East Oakland rapper with whom he found a shared affinity for the rapid-fire lyrical volleys that would define the next step. As Latyrx (a combination of their working names) the two MCs released The Album, in 1997. The LP would go on to become a certified classic, selling 100,000 copies, yet would prove to be the tip of an even larger iceberg. 

Solesides was re-imagined as Quannum Projects in 1999. As co-owner, LB used Quannum as a conduit through which he delivered his most realized project to date, 2003s Later That Day. The album yielded his biggest commercial success to date, Callin Out, which charted nationally and was featured in several major motion pictures, EA Sports games as well as a Diet Coke spot featuring Adrian Brody. The remix LP, Same !@#$ Different Day was released shortly after, showcasing the talents of his closest associates and as well as new material. Meanwhile, Lyrics Born began to explore different means of engaging listeners. He kept fans abreast of his work by peppering the internet with The Lyrics Born Variety Show mixtape series whoch he released himself through his website. The mixtapes, as well as ceaseless touring and the creation of his own internet media outlets Lyrics Born TV and LBFM, were elements of a new formula. 

Since the release of Later That Day, Lyrics Born has averaged over 150 shows a year, and his explosive live energy was captured on the disc Overnite Encore, a compilation of live performances with live musicians from the Australian leg of his 2006 world tour. He followed up in 2008 with Everywhere At Once, a varied studio disk that signaled a departure from the sample-based pieces he had become known for, supplementing the sound with a full band and a healthy does of synthesizers. Hence, he has arrived at well-rounded sound that is classic and yet futuristic. Tom Shimura hasnt forgotten how he got here, but hes never been afraid to look to the future, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

Conspirator, the duo of Disco Biscuits staples Marc Brownstein and Aron Magner which often features guest musicians in the live setting, has announced a national tour of full band performances featuring Chris Michetti and a rotating cast of first-class drummers. The news comes on the heels of a series of performances that have created quite a bit of buzz among band and fans, alike. 

While Brownstein and Magner have occasionally invited other musicians to their live shows, the new Conspirator has proven to be a new, full band sound emerging not only from the groups mentality, but by featuring a solidified, returning, 4-piece lineup. 

Live music fans have come to embrace Conspirator for their signature high energy, electronic-based sets and their legendary album, The Key, which has been a staple of the bands live repertoire for years. Now, with a firmly set 4-piece band, fans can expect performances featuring increased live improv and a refreshing musical flow, peppered with some surprises. Inspired by new collaborations and the combined musical histories of the performers, Conspirator is set to get the scene talking in 2011. 

The energy coming off of the December Conspirator shows with Michetti was very exciting for Aron and I, and the fans have responded really well, said Brownstein. We knew right away we had to take this across the country. There are really exciting places a full band, this full band, can take the classic Conspirator sound. Its a whole new show each night. 

Known throughout the live music world for high energy, creative guitar shredding with his band RAQ, Chris Michetti became much more familiar to Disco Biscuits fans throughout 2010 when he periodically accompanied the band on stage at places like Red Rocks, Camp Bisco, and on a number of Spring Tour performances. Michetti recently lent his signature handiwork to Conspirator during performances earlier this December, and anyone who caught the early phases of the new Conspirator will undeniably be psyched for round two and beyond. 

Lane Shaw exploded onto the live music scene as one-third of the Pnuma Trio. Shaw has recently, and notably, collaborated with the likes of N*E*R*D, Diplo, and DJ Benzi with his latest musical project, Mansions on the Moon. Shaw was once asked to take a crack at an autobiography, and simply listed drums, boats, and Steely Dan. He will perform with Conspirator throughout the Northeast in early January.



Break Science is the culmination of a career of beat-bending by its brainchild duo, Adam Deitch and Borahm Lee.  Deitch, known for his work with John Scofield, Lettuce and others is the perfect counterpoint to Lee, who lends his keyboard soundscapes to Adams modern palate. Break Science is club music in the vein of a live mix tape, blending live trip-hop, broken-beat, dubstep, drum & bass and hip-hop.
Adam and Borahms careers have crossed genres, focusing on hip-hop, funk and jazz.  Both drummer Adam Deitch and keyboard wizard Borahm Lee play the role of producer, programmer and composer. They have produced and performed some of todays top artists, including MF Doom, KRS-One, Wu-Tang Clan, Matisyahu, Redman, John Medeski, Lauren Hill, Snoop Dogg, J-Live, Chali 2na, Lyrics Born, 50-Cent, Talib Kweli and Justin Timberlake.
Of their sound, Adam says, "I dont see why its necessary to play one particular tempo (bpm) or a specific style of breakbeat. Electronic music is still a brand new genre and the rules are wide open. We want to combine the fans of pre-existing electronic genres as well as bring live music lovers into that fold.
Fresh off getting rave reviews for rocking Rothbury and the Trinumeral festivals this summer, the people have spoken, and demand for Break Science is growing by the second.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

The Colorado-based foursome has crisscrossed the country over the past eleven years playing such varied settings as festivals, rock clubs, Red Rocks Amphitheater in the bands home state, and recently the Democratic National Convention in Denver at Mile High Stadium opening for Barack Obama. Their loyal fanbase has been built from this diverse setting of music venues as fans latched on to their genre-defying original sound.

In between tours the band spent time this last year working on its fifth studio album. Set for a September 1 release on the bands own label, The Show is the second album with rock producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott Smith, Foo Fighters). While some might scratch their heads as to why a string band would want a rock producer, this decision was a natural choice for the band. We dont have a lot of nostalgia for the past, says banjo player Dave Johnston. You shouldnt try to recreate the 1940s. I like to think of us as informed by the past and all the great performers before us. But we also want to look forward rather than give people something that has already been perfected.

The Show has the similar acoustic instrumentation (Adam Aijala on guitar, Johnston on banjo, Jeff Austin on mandolin and Ben Kaufman on bass with all four singing) as many of its classic bluegrass forefathers. Though once again drums are present (as with the self-titled fourth album) with the great Pete Thomas of Elvis Costellos bands adding a rhythmic backdrop to Yonders still-acoustic sound on six of the tracks. The record consists of thirteen songs all written by Yonder.

The band has long cited such varied influences as the bluegrass of Del McCoury, Johnson Mountain Boys, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Osborne Brothers as well as the punk rock of Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys. Somewhere in between these two tent poles are early 20th Century composers and alternative rock bands like Grandaddy and Postal Service. Its all funneled through the bands unique chemistry, honed since they first met at an informal club performance in 1998. With band members writing individually, in different pairings and as a collective, the album proves that this group is a collection of creative peers and you can hear it in the rich tapestry of music that makes up The Show.

Here Yonder offers such traditional bluegrass sounding fare as Out Of The Blue and Casualty. The band has explored its country roots in the past and does so again this time on Steep Grade, Sharp Curves, a song that describes the roads around its home base in Nederland as well as a particularly dangerous femme fatale. A little further from the roots is the impressionistic Isolate with its simple but ominous bass line and minimal arrangement. There is also a bevy of rockers like Complicated, Fingerprints and Belle Parker, a gem of a song about a hard-hearted woman. The band even finds some excellent middle ground between bluegrass and rock on Fine Excuses thanks in part to a scorching guitar solo from Adam Aijala. There is also the extended Honestly -- at eight-minutes, the longest song on the album, with a middle section that is an excellent platform for lengthier live excursions that are as improvisatory as any electric band on the live music circuit.

The band is a regular at bluegrass festivals like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the band's own Northwest String Summit as well as massive multi-stage events like Austin City Limits Festival, Bonnaroo and Rothbury. Fans are no doubt drawn to Yonders anything goes attitude, its humor and passion about music, and the bands ability to stretch out live. We love that people come to see us, Johnston points out. Everyone appreciates good music. Some people want to go to a recital and some people want to party.

But as its fans know, Yonder Mountain String Band does something a little different, more than just a musical party. The Show is the bands most varied and versatile album to date, and the summation of the journey that these guys are on together. Its bluegrass for the masses, acoustic tunes filled with dazzling chops, and its fun to boot. The humble Johnston sounds as surprised as anyone by the bands success, but knows that it all boiled down to chemistry, which has never changed. Somewhere down there we all kind of recognized that we had something unique, he explains. But there is no way I could have imagined the amount of success that the band has had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>G. LOVE & SPECIAL SAUCE WED. APRIL 20th at the EUREKA THEATER </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Tart, Tangy, Smooth, and oh so lip-smacking Sweet! Aaah yes, time to praise the almighty summer sippin' thirst quencher, being served straight up G. Love and Special Sauce style, ice cool and always refreshing. On their second release for Brushfire Records, the Philly boys offer up "Lemonade", a series of soul drenched tracks pouring out their blues infused hip-hop, which people have been trying to label for years. The best advice - dont try to tame it or claim it; its simply their sonic trademark, instantly recognizable and addictively delicious. 

"The whole thing about lemonade for me was when I first set out from Philly to make it in the music world I went up to Boston, and I would just sit on the front porch of my place after playing the streets or practicing and make myself a big pitcher of lemonade. It just symbolized old time porch loungin' for that's where I did a lot of my shedding and writing. It was so simple and great, I said, if I ever get a record deal I'm going to get Lemonade tattooed on my arm." 

It's there all right, and seven albums, thirteen years, and over a million worldwide units later, "Lemonade" is the most cohesive and rewarding album Garrett Dutton - a.k.a. G. Love (guitar, vocals, harmonica, sweat and tears) has ever delivered. Produced and engineered in the womb of Philadelphonic Studios by Chris DiBeneditto (Electric Mile & Philadelphonic) and faithfully anchored by the Sauce, Jimi "Jazz" Prescott (acoustic bass), and Jeffrey "Thunderhouse" Clemens (drums, percussion), G. pairs up with some of the best players in the game including Ben Harper, Donovan Frankenreiter, Jasper, Dave Hidalgo (Los Lobos), Blackalicious, Marc Broussard, Tristan Prettyman and Jack Johnson on a fourteen song celebration of his iconic career. 

The tradition of the hip-hop blues has always been to rip open the heart and bare the soul. Tell the listener what they want to hear and you'll have a fair weather friend; tell them the way it is and you'll have true love. Thankfully, the Love is Alive, for G. delivers his loping lilt with bone humming honesty and he's never sounded so clear. From the swarming infectious grooves of "Ride", "Ain't That Right", and "Holla!" to the laid down easy of "Breakin Up", "Still Hanging Around", and "Missing My Baby" G. and The Sauce dance with the muses of their mentors, John Hammond, Bob Dylan, Jimmy Reed, De La Soul without ever missing the beat of their own signature time. 

Pepper this with the mercury simmer of "Hot Cookin'" with Frankenreiter, the idyllic warmth of "Rainbow" with Johnson, the aching duet of "Beautiful" with Prettyman and the handclapping hallelujah of "Let the Music Play" with Harper and Broussard you're left with the pure sound of summer ringing in your ear. 

As G. says of all the collaborations, "We just reached out to a lot of our friends who just happen to be incredible musicians, and everyone was pretty enthusiastic about coming into the studio with us. So while the record maintains a real G. Love feel, it was a real group effort. Especially on "Let the Music Play", I mean Ben and Marc just came down and demolished this track. We cut the rhythm track but left it wide open. So Bens comes through town and he's just on fire. He wrote his verse on the spot, whipped up this tight Wurlitzer part and played a crazy slide guitar solo throughout the whole thing. I already had a chorus together, but he added this gospel style by stacking his vocals a bit which caught the vibe. To top it off I wanted to have Broussard sing some harmony on it, but once in the studio he wanted to try out one of the verses. I asked him if he thought he could do it and he says in his real New Orleans gruff voice, you think I came down here to suck, man? Well okay. Watch out, I mean I never appreciated what an incredible vocalist he is until he just went in, put his church on it and crushed it. To have Ben and Marc, who both come at music from such a soulful way, on the same track was simply epic." 

Even though G. is an insatiable musical omnivore when it comes to feeding off influences, "Lemonade" is his most stylistically cohesive and focused album yet. Grown out of the somewhat dark tension of "The Electric Mile" (2001) and the ass bumping smorgasbord of "The Hustle" (2004), "Lemonade's" overall kickback beat begs the listener to blow out the speakers in musical reaffirmation. "Free" perhaps its deepest and most powerful track pulls the continuity string through it all, for its positive examination of the cycle of rebirth through a persons life backed with a "Fixin' to Die" blues beat perfectly captures the sweat your funk out, soul searchin, dust ridden road warriors G. Love and Special Sauce have come to embody. 

"I'm in a real comfortable place musically and in my life; I'm cruisin right now and it feels good. So when I set out to make this record, I wanted to take my sound, base it on the groove and really get into a deeper pocket. Lyrically, I wanted to talk about what I always talk about finding love, making love, losing love, life and lemonade." 

Yes indeed, what you hold in your hands is pure, fresh, organic, summer sound. So go ahead, scratch it, sniff it, squeeze it, bite it until its juices slide down your elbows and leave you satisfied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Melvin Seals has been a powerful presence in the music industry for over 30 years with a long-established reputation as a performer, recording artist and producer. Melvin is most revered for his powerful, high-spirited, Hammond B-3 organ, and keyboards in the Jerry Garcia Band. Melvin spun his B-3 magic with the Jerry Garcia Band for 18 years and in doing so helped pioneer and define what has now become "Jam Band Music". From blues to funk to rock to jazz, Melvin Seals serves up a tasty mix with a little R&B and gospel thrown in to spice things up. 

Melvin and JGB brings an intuitive, expressive style, soul, spontaneity and remarkable chops to the table. With acoustic and electric ingredients and unique combinations of Stu Allen's guitar and amazing vocals, Jimmy Tebeau's savory bass, Pete Lavezzolis hearty drums and, of course, a heapin' helpin' of the wizard's magic on Hammond B-3 Organ and keyboards. Along with Shirley Starks and Cheryl Rucker on back-up vocals, the result is a most satisfying blend of natural organic grooves that challenges genre boundaries. Their chemistry is the focus from which they create a spontaneous and high art where the sky is the limit musically. They offer an exciting, often psychedelic musical journey that changes nightly and keeps the audience dancing and smiling (and some staring in amazement) for hours.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>Seattle's FLOWMOTION returns to Humbrews </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Thursday, February 24th<P>
Time: 9pm<P>
Admission: $10<P>
Humboldt Brews<P>Hidden beneath the bows of the Northwest evergreens is found Flowmotion, one of Seattles most distinctly diverse rock bands. This is an act that fails to fall into an easily packaged genre, succeeds in defying stereotypes, and throws one hell of a party no matter what city, town or festival the five-piece band happens to land in.

Flowmotion is a name well known in the Seattle live music scene and becoming increasingly familiar up and down the West Coast, yet largely unheard of throughout much of the country. The band has managed to remain in the best-kept-secret vault of the live music scene, all the while honing a live show that often exceeds the size of the stage they might find themselves performing on. A Flowmotion show is a swooping ride through the fingers of rock fueled solely on the expert musicianship of its five parts, producing a sound thats unmistakably huge.

Its nearly impossible to mention the name Flowmotion in the Pacific Northwest without bringing forth a mention of Summer Meltdown, the annual music and camping festival the band has hosted for nearly a decade. As the years have slipped by, the band has watched the annual gathering grow from a backyard bash to one of the regions most well-attended summer festivals  a celebration thats expected to bring as many as 4,000 revelers to the foothills of the Cascade Mountains this summer. While Flowmotion has always been the headliner at the festival, theyve also shared the stage with national bands including Bill Frisell, Vince Herman, Garaj Mahal, Zilla, The Mutaytor, Yard Dogs Road Show, Tea Leaf Green, Buckethead, Everyone Orchestra, Presidents of the United States of America, Jackie Greene, the Mother Hips, and Steve Kimock. 

There are many music fans in the Northwest and beyond who will remember Flowmotion from their years of touring and festival appearances and expect the same band as they heard in the early part of this decade. While the spirit around which Clauson built the band is very much alive, the sound has evolved with Flowmotion incorporating more rock edginess without forgetting the dance floor grooves that have brought them this far. Whereas Clauson previously authored most of the Flowmotion repertoire, songwriting duties have since been delegated amongst the band resulting in set lists that skip across the spectrum reminding listeners of Zeppelin at some moments and Parliament at others.

Its been a steady climb for Flowmotion over the past decade, but it seems like the Northwest is going to have to give up its secret and let everyone in on what Flowmotion brings to the table  and the dance floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

At the Chambers annual dinner last night, Chairman Mike Newman presented the award, and spoke of Mantova's impressive marketing, energy and civic leadership in the community as factors that went into the selection process.  Also present were representatives from US Congressman Mike Thompson, State Senator Noreen Evans and State Assembly Member Wesley Chesbros' respective offices.  Each representative congratulated Mantova's Two Street Music--awarding the music store with signed Certificates of Merit. 
 
Store owner Anthony Mantova was present to accept the awards.  Mantova said "I was surprised, but very happy that we were chosen for the honor (of small business of the year), I also really appreciate the state representatives taking the time to encourage our business.  It's been a lot of hard work for the year and a half that my brothers and I have been in the music industry.

Karl Denson has led a storied career as a multi-faceted recording and performing artist who first came to
prominence as a member of Lenny Kravitz band debuting on his first release, Let Love Rule, and staying on
for the next five years. While developing a following overseas, he joined Fred Wesleys band, touring and
recording with him on multiple releases. This led to five straight ahead jazz albums by Denson on Minor
Music, the last of which was released to rave reviews and featured Karl in a trio setting with Miles Davis
alumni Dave Holland and Jack DeJohnette. In 1993, Denson joined DJ Greyboy in creating Greyboy
Records and released the legendary acid jazz staple, Freestylin. Out of that collaboration, Denson formed
The Greyboy Allstars, which became world renowned as the ultimate groove band, spreading their West
Coast Boogaloo style worldwide.

Denson took this formula to the next level by putting more emphasis on vocals and adding some funk, R&B
and hip hop elements. It turned out to be a winning combination, which set KDTU on the top of the heap in
the touring world from 1999 through 2005, selling over 250,000 records to date. My style is based in dance
shares Denson.  I love the idea of creating something that naturally makes people want to move. KDTU
has headlined and performed at US Festivals including Bonnaroo, Bumbershoot, The New Orleans Jazz and
Heritage Festival, All Good Music Festival, Wakarusa Music Festival, Playboy Jazz Festival, Monterey Jazz
Festival, Newport Jazz Festival and many more. Global festival appearances include the Fuji Rock Festival
in Japan, North Sea Jazz festival in Holland, Moscow Jazz Festival in Russia, East Coast Blues and Roots
Festival in Australia and the Montreux Jazz festival in Switzerland. Karl Densons Tiny Universe has shared
the stage with acts as diverse as Jack Johnson, DAngelo, James Brown, Dave Matthews Band, Michael
Franti & Spearhead, The Allman Brothers, Keene and Maroon 5.

Densons latest release, Brothers Keeper, continues his artistic evolution fusing sounds from Rock to Funk
to Afrobeat. Meshell Ndegeocello (bass) and Marc Ford (guitar, Black Crowes, Ben Harper) are just some of
the special guests on the album. Denson notes, Im not one to live in the past. I am very much a forward
thinker. Brothers Keeper is a continuation of my general worldview, which is that we should be loving each
other, having fun and taking care of one another. He concludes, This record is the culmination of all my
lifes work up until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>JJ Grey Solo @ Humbrews Feb 26 </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Singing with a passion and fervor directly influenced by the classic soul heroes, JJ Grey has written and recorded five albums of original songs steeped in the rhythm & blues, rock, and country soul of his native backwoods home outside Jacksonville, Florida. Grey comes from a long tradition of Southern storytellers and, in that spirit, he fills his songs with details that are at once vivid, personal and universal. After a decade of hard touring, he still spends eight months of the year on the road, bringing his music to a loyal, ever-growing, worldwide fanbase

In a live performance review in The New York Times, writer Nate Chinen praised JJ's balance of wildness and cool describing his music as "Southern swamp rock with undercurrents of Memphis soul. His songs chronicle ambiguous truths and unambiguous urges," delivered by Grey's winningly uncontrived vocals. Likewise, Billboard has praised Greys world-beating blend of Southern rock, blues and Florida swamp soul.

2010 sees the Alligator Records release of Greys latest labor of love, Georgia Warhorse, named after the resilient Southern lubber grasshopper. Yellow and black, and tough like an old-school Tonka toy, says JJ. They seem so at ease with the world. Nothing seems to rile them. Theyre in no hurry but they have a kind of resilience because they just keep coming back and Ive always felt there was a lesson in there for me to learn. Grey could be described in such words; his own career has grown over the course of a decade of winning over fans night after night

As with the previous releases, Grey meticulously demoed the entire Georgia Warhorse album himself on the various instruments in his own home studio he calls the Egg Room. Its named after the old refrigerator room we used to keep eggs in when my grandparents were in the egg business, says Grey. Once Im done with the demos then I start thinking about hitting the real studio. Armed with eleven new original songs including one co-written with songwriting icons Chuck Prophet and Angelo Petraglia (Kings of Leon), Grey and long-time friend and producer Dan Prothero hit the real studio, Jim Devitos Retrophonics in St. Augustine, Florida, to begin tracking Georgia Warhorse. There, Grey would again track the majority of the instruments himself, playing guitars, keys, harmonica and delivering all the vocals with his gritty, straight-from-the-soul voice. Protheros approach as producer and Retrophonics unvarnished, natural sound mirrors Greys vision of musical tones and his love of the rustic Florida backwoods, where his family has lived for generations.

Joining him for a track on this album is Greys long-time musical hero and reggae icon Toots Hibbert, who sings with Grey on The Sweetest Thing. Toots is the greatest soul singer Ive ever heard and one of my biggest influences, says Grey. Georgia Warhorse also provided the opportunity for Grey to work with another friend and hero, fellow Jacksonvillian Derek Trucks. In true neighborly fashion, Trucks stopped by JJs house to record slide guitar for the song Lullaby. Derek Trucks is the greatest guitarist Ive ever seen and Im honored to have Derek and Toots on my record, says Grey.

Debuting in 2001 with the CD Blackwater, following up in 2004 with Lochloosa, Grey steadily built his following one live performance at a time. Both albums (reissued by Alligator in 2007) were released under the name Mofro, a name the young Grey chose to describe his music and sound while still working his day job at a lumberyard. He has since used the word to name his band of ever-changing world-class players. The albums were met with critical acclaim, including one of the 10 best R&B records of the year and one of the best of the decade at Amazon.com for Blackwater and one of the 10 best releases of the year in Rolling Stone for Lochloosa.

In 2007, with his first Alligator release, Country Ghetto, Grey reached an even larger audience, doubling both his album sales and his concert attendance. Relix said, Country Ghetto is a tribute to JJ Greys rich comprehension of the Souths learned musical roots and knack to make age-old ideas sound fresh. Grey and Mofro fuse rock with plenty of soul, groove-heavy blues, and dirty, infectious funk. The deep and introspective lyrics are a breath of fresh air. 2008s Orange Blossoms built on that energy, with even more fans, radio stations and critics coming on board. A 2009 best-of LP, The Choice Cuts, has kept the momentum going.

Grey, an avid outdoorsman, is a dedicated fisherman and surfer and holds an honorary position on the board of the Snook Foundation, dedicated to the protection of coastal fish and fish habitat. He has written passionately and articulately about his love for the untrammeled environment of his north Florida home.

JJ has brought his music to countless festivals, including Austin City Limits Festival, Byron Bay Blues Festival (Australia), Bonnaroo, Montreal Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock (Japan). Over the course of his 15-plus year career, Grey has shared stages with the likes of the B.B. King, The Allman Brothers Band, The Black Crowes, Los Lobos, Jeff Beck, Ben Harper, Lenny Kravitz, Booker T. Jones, Mavis Staples and many others. In the spring of 2010 Grey was awarded the opportunity of a lifetime as a solo acoustic opener with soul legends Mavis Staples and Booker T. Jones on the What It Is! tour. JJ reminisces, Getting to open up for such legends, its just something Ill never forget.

His songs have also appeared in film and on network and cable television programs including House, Flashpoint, Crash, Friday Night Lights, The Deadliest Catch, and the film The Hoot. In November 2009, JJ wrote his first film score for the critically acclaimed documentary The Good Soldier that appeared in theatres and on Bill Moyers' Journal on PBS. Recently, Grey played piano, sang and contributed a song (The Wrong Side) to Buckwheat Zydecos Grammy-winning Alligator album, Lay Your Burden Down.

With the release of Georgia Warhorse and a relentless world tour to follow, Grey is set for a breakout year. Commenting on his musical future, he says, Life just makes itself up right in front of me and I just roll with it. All I know is to have the family I have, see the places Ive been, meet the people Ive met and to get to play music with some of the most talented folks around has got to make me the luckiest man alive.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Sean Sabo and fellow members of the upstart, local band "Serious Lee" were shopping at Mantova's Two Street Music for a high end guitar amplifier. He was considering the Orange Rockerverb 100 Watt II, and asked store owner, Anthony Mantova if he could "crank it up" to hear its full range.  Mantova said "go ahead."  Sabo was excited about the amplifier and discussed the possibility of making payments, financing and trading in gear to purchase it.
 
<P>
The racket from the Rockerverb didnt go unnoticed.  Across the street, at the Eagle House Hotel, Zan (last name withheld) heard the music and decided to investigate.
<P>
 
Zan, a machine shop worker residing in Belmont, CA stood near the store's doorway and listened to Sabo play through the amplifier, and after talking a little while with Sabo he said "I am going to get that for you, I want you to keep playing."  Shock, bewilderment and an outpouring of emotion rocked everyone involved--as employees, the band and a generous stranger made local music history.
 
<P>
Sean Sabo's life changed forever at that point, as a complete stranger gave him one of the best high end amplifiers a music store can offer.  Zan then took Sean, and his two friends out for a celebratory drink at the Irish Pub, Gallaghers across the street. Then they headed back to the store and Serious Lee jammed in the store for a couple songs. 

<P>
Mantova said "we fully expect Serious Lee to continue their musical journey and become a major influence for the North Coast music scene.  Today's act of generosity is something you hear about, but never see.  I feel like there was some kind of spiritual connection between these two--the musician and a man who tries to make his world a better place."

W/ SPECIAL GUESTS BLU, & SHOTGUN WEDDING QUINTET<P>
February 22, 2011 (SAN FRANCISCO, CA)- At last! West Coast hip-hop stalwarts Zion I & The Grouch return with their sophomore collaborative effort Heroes in the Healing of the Nation, in stores March 22, 2011.  The long-awaited follow-up to the group's 2006 critically acclaimed Heroes in the City of Dope could not arrive at a more fitting hour. This time around Z&G raise the stakes to expand the playing field from City to Nation, inviting listeners everywhere to join them on their quest in channeling their highest selves.
Zion I & The Grouch are excited to announce a nationwide tour, starting March 19 at the historic Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.  The trio, long since known for tackling weighty topics, are donating 100% of all ticketing fees sold through ZioniAndTheGrouch.com to local community organizations.  The group has partnered up with different community organizations in every city, and they have chosen the Surfrider Foundation for their show at Humbrews in Humboldt, CA on March 23rd.Touching people with our music is the main thing we can do," explains The Grouch of the motive behind the donations, "but contributing in a monetary way is taking things to the next level.
<P>"This album is intended to stimulate positive change in people's lives," says Zumbi.  "Whether that be a smile during hard times, or a shift in perspective, the idea is that we help to facilitate a soulful healing session.  This record is like a massage for the mind, body, and spirit."<P>
The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our worlds oceans, waves and beaches. Founded in 1984 by a handful of visionary surfers in Malibu, California, the Surfrider Foundation now maintains over 50,000 members and 80 chapters worldwide, including Humboldt, CA.<P>
The Healing of the Nation Tour also features Blu and The Shotgun Wedding Quintet (San Francisco's own Jazz Mafia collective) opening each show.  Heroes in the Healing of the Nation features Freeway, Roy Ayers, Fashawn, Casual, Mystic, Eric Rachmany, Jacob Hemphill of Soja, Eligh, Marty James, Los Rakas, Codany Holiday, and the R.O.D Project and is due out March 22, 2011.

His message is pure rasta conscious vibes. A distinct and powerful stage presence, a Prezident Brown show is a transcendent spiritual movement that leaves audiences satiated, sweaty and smiling." - (jambase)

<P>

Prezident Brown (Fitz Cotterell) was born in the hills of Clarendon, Jamaica. His mother called him Junior Ranking because he would grab the microphone and chant at schoolyard and country dances. He was first known as Slim Brown because of his resemblance to and similar DJ style to his mentor, U Brown. The most formative influence on Prezident Brown was producer and sound system operator Jack Ruby. Ruby saw something special in young Slim Brown; he took Slim Brown under his wing, re-named him Prezident Brown and appointed him resident M.C. of his Hi-Power Sound System, traveling worldwide.<P>
More About Prezident Brown
 <P>
After the sound system era changed following Jack Ruby's death in 1989, he began recording with Grove Music, who later founded Irie FM in Jamaica. After that, he recorded with Roof International, Courtney Cole's label. Eventually it was Barry O'Hare's label, X-Rated (now World of Music,) that provided a home base for Prezident Brown and helped launch his career in Europe. X-Rated took off just as a massive roots revival swept across Jamaica, washing gun and slackness lyrics out of the dance halls, paving the way for conscious reggae music. Of course Prezident Brown was bound to rise in that kind of climate. He is a champion in the new roots and reality consciousness. Prezident Brown entertains, informs and inspires. His message is pure rasta conscious vibes.<P>
 
By 1995, he flooded the market from all sides, he was freelancing without a break. He was bringing out boom-tunes on the X-Rated label, among others like Digital B, Black Scorpio, Mango and Star Trail. He recorded the song, "Blow Your Nose," with Everton Blender, (an artist, with whom, he has toured Africa and Europe.) Prezident Brown also recorded on Tony Rebel's Flames label. (It should be noted that his style is frequently liken to that of Rebel's.) Prezident was also featured in the song, "Black And Proud," on the Steel Pulse album Rage And Fury. He has recorded with numerous other reggae legends as well. Barry O'Hare's X-rated label produced two albums, Big Bad and Talented and Prezident Selections, (distributed on the Runn label.) After a third album, Original Blueprint, (produced by Digital B, now licensed by VP Records) he continued t release singles. 1996 he signed a lucrative 5 album artist deal with Island Records, which didn't work in his favor. He then made the timeless To Jah Only album with the highly regarded Ocho Rios label, Kariang, in 1998.<P>
 
At the turn of the millenium he worked with German based label Chet Records and released the album Generation Next which is distributed by Sony Germany. "Unleash the Lion", A 46 show tour in the summer of 2002 with the Orchestra of Judah put together by Jahmani Productions took Prezident Brown all over the United States, including performances at The Sierra Nevada World Music Festival and Reggae On The River. Also, Jahmani Productions released Showcase Volumes 1 and 2 that year with Showcase Volume 3 following in 2003. Prezident has since done repeat performances at both festivals and has added may other prestigious ones to his list such as the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in 2008. Prezident Brown continues to perform worldwide, recent performances include Israel and Paris in February of 2009.
<P>
Prezident Brown has been very well received in the United States and is building a large fan base, and as a champion of the new roots and reality consciousness reggae movement he entertains, informs and inspires. Prezident Brown's music speaks a universal language. All of his albums and singles will remain timelessly beautiful and his fourth album, To Jah Only, features one of the most spiritually devoted songs in reggae history, "To Jah Only." His music is echoed overseas and his talent is unequivocal. All of his albums are a must for anyone who loves reggae music. Prezident Brown is an artist driven by a sense of mission and purpose which dictates that he "edutains" (heightens the consciousness of a people) as much as entertains. Prezident Brown is eminently qualified for the role in which he is seen as a vessel from which flows the healing effect of his musical staple.<P>

YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND returns to one of their favorite stomping grounds on Thursday April 14th, the Eureka Theater!!
<P>

" That energy is contagious. Shows will travel between darkly rendered murder ballads, where Austin will skat with psycho killer intensity, to bright sunshine, where an uplifting tune can buoy the spirit with happiness. Extended instrumental improv can break down into near chaos, or the four can wind tightly around fast-picking bluegrass numbers."- Sarah Hagerman (Relix)
<P>

YYonder Mountain String Band has always played music by its own set of rules. Bending bluegrass, rock and countless other influences that the band cites, Yonder has pioneered a sound of their own. With their traditional lineup of instruments, the band may look like a traditional bluegrass band at first glance but theyve created their own music that transcends any genre. Dave Johnston points out What could be more pure than making your own music. Yonders sound cannot be classified purely as bluegrass or string music but rather its an original sound created from looking at music from [their] own experiences and doing the best job possible. The band continues to play by their own rules on their new record The Show.<P>

The Colorado-based foursome has crisscrossed the country over the past eleven years playing such varied settings as festivals, rock clubs, Red Rocks Amphitheater in the bands home state, and recently the Democratic National Convention in Denver at Mile High Stadium opening for Barack Obama. Their loyal fanbase has been built from this diverse setting of music venues as fans latched on to their genre-defying original sound.
<P>
In between tours the band spent time this last year working on its fifth studio album. Set for a September 1 release on the bands own label, The Show is the second album with rock producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott Smith, Foo Fighters). While some might scratch their heads as to why a string band would want a rock producer, this decision was a natural choice for the band. We dont have a lot of nostalgia for the past, says banjo player Dave Johnston. You shouldnt try to recreate the 1940s. I like to think of us as informed by the past and all the great performers before us. But we also want to look forward rather than give people something that has already been perfected.
<P>
The Show has the similar acoustic instrumentation (Adam Aijala on guitar, Johnston on banjo, Jeff Austin on mandolin and Ben Kaufman on bass with all four singing) as many of its classic bluegrass forefathers. Though once again drums are present (as with the self-titled fourth album) with the great Pete Thomas of Elvis Costellos bands adding a rhythmic backdrop to Yonders still-acoustic sound on six of the tracks. The record consists of thirteen songs all written by Yonder.<P>

The band has long cited such varied influences as the bluegrass of Del McCoury, Johnson Mountain Boys, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Osborne Brothers as well as the punk rock of Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys. Somewhere in between these two tent poles are early 20th Century composers and alternative rock bands like Grandaddy and Postal Service. Its all funneled through the bands unique chemistry, honed since they first met at an informal club performance in 1998. With band members writing individually, in different pairings and as a collective, the album proves that this group is a collection of creative peers and you can hear it in the rich tapestry of music that makes up The Show.<P>

Here Yonder offers such traditional bluegrass sounding fare as Out Of The Blue and Casualty. The band has explored its country roots in the past and does so again this time on Steep Grade, Sharp Curves, a song that describes the roads around its home base in Nederland as well as a particularly dangerous femme fatale. A little further from the roots is the impressionistic Isolate with its simple but ominous bass line and minimal arrangement. There is also a bevy of rockers like Complicated, Fingerprints and Belle Parker, a gem of a song about a hard-hearted woman. The band even finds some excellent middle ground between bluegrass and rock on Fine Excuses thanks in part to a scorching guitar solo from Adam Aijala. There is also the extended Honestly -- at eight-minutes, the longest song on the album, with a middle section that is an excellent platform for lengthier live excursions that are as improvisatory as any electric band on the live music circuit.<P>

The band is a regular at bluegrass festivals like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the band's own Northwest String Summit as well as massive multi-stage events like Austin City Limits Festival, Bonnaroo and Rothbury. Fans are no doubt drawn to Yonders anything goes attitude, its humor and passion about music, and the bands ability to stretch out live. We love that people come to see us, Johnston points out. Everyone appreciates good music. Some people want to go to a recital and some people want to party.
<P>
But as its fans know, Yonder Mountain String Band does something a little different, more than just a musical party. The Show is the bands most varied and versatile album to date, and the summation of the journey that these guys are on together. Its bluegrass for the masses, acoustic tunes filled with dazzling chops, and its fun to boot. The humble Johnston sounds as surprised as anyone by the bands success, but knows that it all boiled down to chemistry, which has never changed. Somewhere down there we all kind of recognized that we had something unique, he explains. But there is no way I could have imagined the amount of success that the band has had.

Sun Araw To Open For Animal Collective April 12th at Mateel
<P>
On Tuesday, April 12th the Mateel Community Center in Redway will present a very rare performance
by Animal Collective and only a couple hundred tickets remain. Headlining this years Coachella Music
Festival, Animal Collective is one of the biggest indie rock bands in the U.S. and this special Mateel
performance will be one of only several West Coast dates theyll be playing as they warm up for the
festival.<P>

Opening the show will be the psychedelic trance of Sun Araw, who describe their sound as a bit like a
lava lamp or maybe Fela Kuti slowed down to a crawl and spread into infinity. Brainchild of Cameron
Stallones (also of Magic Lantern) this 3-piece group has been tinkering with amniotic dub and psych-
trance for an end result that is panoramic and dizzyingly huge, incorporating warm climate vibes like
desert rock, raga, afrobeat, and dub into a symbiotic whole that is unlike anything else youve ever
heard.
<P>
Tickets for this event are already over 75% sold out and locals are encouraged not to delay any longer
in getting their tickets. Doors open at 8pm with Sun Araw at 9pm. Tickets are priced at $25 and are
available online at www.mateel.org and at the Mateel office. For more information visit the website or

Bay Area music legend Melvin seals and JGB bring their musical stylings to Humboldt Brews Wednesday April 20th

<P>
"As Melvin Seals and the Jerry Garcia Band took the stage,  two things struck me almost immediately Seals pours his heart into his Hammond B-3 organ and his smile out onto the crowd." -Phil Santala

<P>

Melvin Seals has been a powerful presence in the music industry for over 30 years with a long-established reputation as a performer, recording artist and producer. Melvin is most revered for his powerful, high-spirited, Hammond B-3 organ, and keyboards in the Jerry Garcia Band. Melvin spun his B-3 magic with the Jerry Garcia Band for 18 years and in doing so helped pioneer and define what has now become "Jam Band Music". From blues to funk to rock to jazz, Melvin Seals serves up a tasty mix with a little R&B and gospel thrown in to spice things up.
<P>
Melvin and JGB brings an intuitive, expressive style, soul, spontaneity and remarkable chops to the table. With acoustic and electric ingredients and unique combinations of Stu Allen's guitar and amazing vocals, Jimmy Tebeau's savory bass, Pete Lavezzolis hearty drums and, of course, a heapin' helpin' of the wizard's magic on Hammond B-3 Organ and keyboards. Along with Shirley Starks and Cheryl Rucker on back-up vocals, the result is a most satisfying blend of natural organic grooves that challenges genre boundaries. Their chemistry is the focus from which they create a spontaneous and high art where the sky is the limit musically. They offer an exciting, often psychedelic musical journey that changes nightly and keeps the audience dancing and smiling (and some staring in amazement) for hours.
<P>
Adding his rock-gospel-soul-rhythm and blues touch with his funky style of playing, no wonder Jerry nicknamed him "Master of the Universe". Melvin continues to treat music lovers to his unique brand of melodic flavor with JGB. Come see and hear for yourself!

G. LOVE & SPECIAL SAUCE




<P>

G. Love & Special Sauce return to the North Coast in support of his new album "Fixin to Die" Wednesday April 20th at the Eureka Theater

<P>
"This is the most inspired i've ever felt making a record - lets just put it that way, i'm still buzzing about it." - G. Love

<P>
Tart, Tangy, Smooth, and oh so lip-smacking Sweet! Aaah yes, time to praise the almighty summer sippin' thirst quencher, being served straight up G. Love and Special Sauce style, ice cool and always refreshing. On their second release for Brushfire Records, the Philly boys offer up "Lemonade", a series of soul drenched tracks pouring out their blues infused hip-hop, which people have been trying to label for years. The best advice - dont try to tame it or claim it; its simply their sonic trademark, instantly recognizable and addictively delicious.
<P>
"The whole thing about lemonade for me was when I first set out from Philly to make it in the music world I went up to Boston, and I would just sit on the front porch of my place after playing the streets or practicing and make myself a big pitcher of lemonade. It just symbolized old time porch loungin' for that's where I did a lot of my shedding and writing. It was so simple and great, I said, if I ever get a record deal I'm going to get Lemonade tattooed on my arm."
<P>
It's there all right, and seven albums, thirteen years, and over a million worldwide units later, "Lemonade" is the most cohesive and rewarding album Garrett Dutton - a.k.a. G. Love (guitar, vocals, harmonica, sweat and tears) has ever delivered. Produced and engineered in the womb of Philadelphonic Studios by Chris DiBeneditto (Electric Mile & Philadelphonic) and faithfully anchored by the Sauce, Jimi "Jazz" Prescott (acoustic bass), and Jeffrey "Thunderhouse" Clemens (drums, percussion), G. pairs up with some of the best players in the game including Ben Harper, Donovan Frankenreiter, Jasper, Dave Hidalgo (Los Lobos), Blackalicious, Marc Broussard, Tristan Prettyman and Jack Johnson on a fourteen song celebration of his iconic career.
<P>
The tradition of the hip-hop blues has always been to rip open the heart and bare the soul. Tell the listener what they want to hear and you'll have a fair weather friend; tell them the way it is and you'll have true love. Thankfully, the Love is Alive, for G. delivers his loping lilt with bone humming honesty and he's never sounded so clear. From the swarming infectious grooves of "Ride", "Ain't That Right", and "Holla!" to the laid down easy of "Breakin Up", "Still Hanging Around", and "Missing My Baby" G. and The Sauce dance with the muses of their mentors, John Hammond, Bob Dylan, Jimmy Reed, De La Soul without ever missing the beat of their own signature time.<P>

Pepper this with the mercury simmer of "Hot Cookin'" with Frankenreiter, the idyllic warmth of "Rainbow" with Johnson, the aching duet of "Beautiful" with Prettyman and the handclapping hallelujah of "Let the Music Play" with Harper and Broussard you're left with the pure sound of summer ringing in your ear.
<P>
As G. says of all the collaborations, "We just reached out to a lot of our friends who just happen to be incredible musicians, and everyone was pretty enthusiastic about coming into the studio with us. So while the record maintains a real G. Love feel, it was a real group effort. Especially on "Let the Music Play", I mean Ben and Marc just came down and demolished this track. We cut the rhythm track but left it wide open. So Bens comes through town and he's just on fire. He wrote his verse on the spot, whipped up this tight Wurlitzer part and played a crazy slide guitar solo throughout the whole thing. I already had a chorus together, but he added this gospel style by stacking his vocals a bit which caught the vibe. To top it off I wanted to have Broussard sing some harmony on it, but once in the studio he wanted to try out one of the verses. I asked him if he thought he could do it and he says in his real New Orleans gruff voice, you think I came down here to suck, man? Well okay. Watch out, I mean I never appreciated what an incredible vocalist he is until he just went in, put his church on it and crushed it. To have Ben and Marc, who both come at music from such a soulful way, on the same track was simply epic."
<P>
Even though G. is an insatiable musical omnivore when it comes to feeding off influences, "Lemonade" is his most stylistically cohesive and focused album yet. Grown out of the somewhat dark tension of "The Electric Mile" (2001) and the ass bumping smorgasbord of "The Hustle" (2004), "Lemonade's" overall kickback beat begs the listener to blow out the speakers in musical reaffirmation. "Free" perhaps its deepest and most powerful track pulls the continuity string through it all, for its positive examination of the cycle of rebirth through a persons life backed with a "Fixin' to Die" blues beat perfectly captures the sweat your funk out, soul searchin, dust ridden road warriors G. Love and Special Sauce have come to embody.
<P>
"I'm in a real comfortable place musically and in my life; I'm cruisin right now and it feels good. So when I set out to make this record, I wanted to take my sound, base it on the groove and really get into a deeper pocket. Lyrically, I wanted to talk about what I always talk about finding love, making love, losing love, life and lemonade."
<P>
Yes indeed, what you hold in your hands is pure, fresh, organic, summer sound. So go ahead, scratch it, sniff it, squeeze it, bite it until its juices slide down your elbows and leave you satisfied.

&it seems like times they are on a mission  like its their duty to interpret Zeppelin in front of a crowd, like unseen hands and vocal chords are guiding them.  Tahoe Weekly

<P>

How to honor the legacy of a band deemed sacred? To tread on holy ground is perilous, and must be done with the intent and spirit of a disciplePay attention to the intricacies of the magic, explore the far ends of the innovation, strive for ever-growing ability, and let the purity of the love for the music drive it all.
<P>
After a stellar five year run of tours throughout the United States, two live albums, and sharing stages with the likes of KISS, Y&T, and The English Beat, Zepparella drummer Clementine and guitarist Gretchen Menn embrace change and welcome two new band members.
<P>
Singer Miaya Shambry, the latest sensation from Portland, Oregon, steps up to front the Zepparella machine with talent, soul, and chops that are thrilling to witness. She has performed with Jon Anderson from Yes and Nick Harmer from Death Cab For Cutie, and toured the country three times as a member of the Paul Green School of Rock West-Coast Allstars. Miayas vocal and emotional range as a singer is astounding, and her mastery of the Plant catalog is unsurpassed.
<P>
Bassist Angeline Saris is one of the Bay Areas busiest bass players. From jazz to speed metal, R&B to rock, Cuban to hip-hop, and flamenco to rockabilly, Angeline has done it all - and done it extremely well. It is this versatility, as well as her rock solid time and tastefully crafted bass lines, that have helped keep her busy. Angeline credits John Paul Jones as a main influence, so it is no surprise that she shines as she interprets his thunder.
<P>
Zepparella continues to explore their own improvised magic within the framework of Zeppelins mighty songs.
<P>
For five years, the Zeppelin love has washed in waves out of the doors of the venues. Initial skeptics have been quickly converted. Followers recount the number of shows theyve seen, and the regulars notch 40, 50, over 100 shows on their belts, traveling between states to see the shows.
<P>
The band is beyond excited for the new incarnation.

A fitting description for the band and their fourth full-length and first national release, "Sole Kitchen," engineered, mixed, and produced by MxPX/Tumbledown front man Mike Herrera at Herrera's Monkey Trench Studios in Bremerton, Washington.

The band will be releasing "Sole Kitchen" via brick and mortar distribution, their first album to be nationally distributed to retail, on April 26, 2011.

Having performed on radio shows such as BBC, NPR, and RTE, and sharing the stage with acts as diverse as Old Crown Medicine Show, Mumford and Sons, Wilco, The Red Stick Ramblers, Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three, and Woody Pines, the Water Tower Bucket Boys have honed their skills (and sound) to win over an eclectic array of audiences.

"Old Crow Medicine Show, who we are big fans of and have influenced us a lot, have been instrumental in our career," states one of the band's multi-instrumentalists/co-vocalist Kenny Feinstein.  "Gill Landry [from Old Crow Medicine Show] gave us an exact busking route from North Carolina back to Oregon that we followed town for town, bar for bar.  He is known as the king of busking in our circle and we were grateful for this 'secret' route.  He taught us about little bars in tiny towns that would profit well for us.  Every turn on Gill's map was an exciting and fruitful venture."

Busking is how Water Tower Bucket Boys got their start, playing traditional, old-time music and bluegrass on street corners up and down the west coast, before progressing to square dances and bluegrass festivals.

After several trips to Europe and back, and being introduced and influenced by many other bands, including Velvet Underground, cajun culture and music, Chuck Ragan/Hot Water Music (Ragan hand-picked the band to perform on a leg of last year's Revival Tour), Mumford and Sons, Wilco, and even electronic music (even if it doesn't reflect in their music), Water Tower Bucket Boys sought to expand their sound even further, incorporate more of their current listening tastes into the music, and the result is "Sole Kitchen."

"Water Tower is about trying to defy definition," says banjo/guitarist and co-vocalist Cory Goldman.  "We've been shifting around stylistically as long as we've been a band and are continuing to evolve.  Its about being true to our roots but also not being afraid to experiment and push forward."

Meeting Mike Herrera through a friend, they eventually met up with him at a Tumbledown show, gave him a copy of some of their music, and a dialogue began.  Soon the band found themselves in Bremerton, Washington, for a weekend, recording at Herrera's studio what would become "Sole Kitchen."

Tracking and mixing in a whirlwind two days, the band recorded the entire record one day (sans a few overdubs the next), setting up a few mics and doing what they do best: playing live.

"Our sound is loosely based in the traditions of old time, bluegrass, punk rock, blues, Cajun, and country," explains Josh Rabie, the band's third multi-instrumentalist and co-vocalist.  "We pride ourselves on tight, three-part harmonies and powerful instrumentals.  And, when we were recording with Mike, we really just wanted to capture all that energy on record.  I think we accomplished it."

Adds Goldman, "'Sole Kitchen' was really just our first step in a new direction, trying to redefine the nature of the band beyond just rocking out tunes and songs.  I really feel like its our first album all over again in a way, our first one done in a professional studio and our first one where we are really putting all our skills out there.  It's about opening the door to the next new thing!"

One of the album's high points is "Heaven," one of the first tracks the band ever decided to have drums on, and the song that inspired them to decide to incorporate drums on future songs and recordings.

Other album highs include "Telegraph," a song that chronicles a true night the band experienced in Berkeley, California after purchasing acid from a punk on the street while busking.  "Blackbird Pickin' At A Squirrel," a song that showcases the band's instrument versatility and musical style and "Goatheads," a number about one of the members blacking out while on tour are two more album highs.  As is "Numb," a song that tackles the problem of addictive behavior.

"Our goals with 'Sole Kitchen' are to reach people who have never enjoyed the banjo, mandolin, or fiddle. To bring songs that are relevant in today's social climate while maintaining their roots," comments Feinstein.

Cory Goldman (banjo, guitar, vocals), Kenny Feinstein (guitar, mandolin, harmonica, fiddle, vocals), and Josh Rabie (fiddle, guitar, harmonica, mandolin, vocals) comprise Water Tower Bucket Boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

Greensky Bluegrass Summer tour is going coast to coast in support of their new album "Handguns".
Catch them Tuesday July 26th at Humboldt Brews 


"This group really isn't like any other band -- they are truly original. Their music is fresh and alive and entertaining...From the band's orignal works to those of John Lennon or Pink Floyd, they're full of pleasant acoustic surprises." -(Cybergrass)



GREENSKY BLUEGRASS is one of the most exciting bands in todays music scene. Like a breath of fresh air, this five piece band plays traditional bluegrass instruments and uses them to create original songs and soundscapes that are unique and new, yet somehow feel comfortable and familiar. Though they have been likened to 70s era Americana acts like The Band, Greensky would prefer not to be compared to any other bands. We really just try to make music as a group that sounds and feels right to us, says mandolin player Paul Hoffman, later adding that it is nice to know that other people really dig it, too. 

Greensky Bluegrass hits timeless targets with deadly accuracy while simultaneously veering off the tired and true highway.-Jambase.com 

While green sky is the opposite of blue grass, the band insists that the name came about as more of a pun than a statement about their music. Along with the tradition of bluegrass, we all have lots of different musical influences that we bring to the table, says guitar player Dave Bruzza, and we somehow wanted to reflect that in our name. Upon witnessing the bands live shows, this statement seems to make a little more sense. On any given night, in addition to the myriad of excellent original songs, one might hear traditional bluegrass songs with an exploratory rock and roll jam or selections from the Talking Heads, Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead or Bob Marley turned bluegrass. We are as likely to play a three minute song as we are a ten minute song on any given night, says dobro player Anders Beck, and I think that keeps it exciting for the audience. Perhaps this is the reason that Greensky Bluegrass is as equally embraced by the jam-band community as it is the bluegrass/Americana community and the bands fan base is growing so rapidly. 

Of course, this is bluegrass. So manic chops mean a lot to Greensky Bluegrass. Yet they are also masterful storytellers. Mandolinist Paul Hoffman in particular pens some true rural balladry. -Seattle Weekly 

Since winning the 2006 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest, Greensky has been touring constantly, playing over 170 shows a year, and all the hard work is certainly paying off. Recent highlights are too many to list, but include selling out venues in many parts of the country, sharing the stage with musical heroes, getting asked to play shows with the likes of Tony Rice and Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Yonder Mountain String Band and Railroad Earth, and being asked to play the inaugural Rothbury Festival in their home state of Michigan. It certainly felt like an affirmation that we are doing something right, noted bass player Mike Devol. 

Greensky Bluegrass is touring in support of their new album, Handguns. The album, their strongest to date, features fourteen original tracks and showcases the bands songwriting and playing talents in a way that is incredibly accessible to fans of many different types of music. 

Greensky Bluegrass is Anders Beck (dobro), Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), Mike Devol (upright bass) and Paul Hoffman (mandolin). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"></font>

Speed of Darkness
Speed of Darkness formed in 2008 on the redwood cliffs overlooking the pacific in northern California. With roots deeply embedded in the punk and metal scenes from the east coast to the west, they combine many styles of music into a dynamic aural force of nature.  

Aranya
A friend recently complained to me how todays doom metalwith its common characteristics of punishing low end, monotony, and harsh vocalsmakes him feel this small. He described it in ways I might describe power electronics or brass-knuckle industrial music: unrelenting, unnerving, impossible to enjoy. I dont share the feeling, but his impression has been hard to shake. Good, then, that local female-fronted heathen metal band Aranya is a clear deviation from what could be considered the grating status quo in Doomtown. Multi-instrumentalist frontwoman Uta Plotkin locks into vocal trances more reminiscent of mid-90s Sky Cries Mary than Portlands caricature-worthy Southern Lord worshippers. Her tribal wail soars outside the proper metallic grit of a band that bravely tries Tomahawk-like American Indian music and European folk metal as well. Listening to Aranya, it is impossible to feel small.
-- Mike Meyer, Portland Mercury

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Greetings our musical friends! 

You are getting this email since you all have been staunch supporters of the Point, or your name was given to us from one of our sister station friends, because you are the bringers of great music to Humboldt county. Therefore you get a personal email from us reminding you to take part in The Point's Classic Cover Contest! We are currently taking band submissions and gauging interest in this monster of a task. In order for the contest to get setup-- I need an approx idea of how many bands are interested in taking part. Contest requires each band to record and submit up to 2 classic cover tracks.

Contest info is now posted on the Point website at www.kwpt.com, including 1003 cover song possibilities, and all the contest rules. (Note that if your song is not on the list that doesn't mean it's not acceptable. Call and discuss with us at 786-5978 or simply email me) The purpose of the song list is only suggestive. We just want songs that are familiar to our listeners and not too deep into an artist's catalog. 



If you and your band are interested, please reply to this email with:
Your band's name
Name and Contact Phone Number/email address
A photo of your band to be used for social networking during the contest

Please take a moment to do this now. We will eventually be calling out for your band's music submissions also-- but there is plenty of time. 
Submission deadline for music tracks is October 14th. 

There will be prizes of course for the winners including 5 hours of free recording time with Mantova's, and the Humboldt county voted #1 band will have the opportunity to perform covers and originals for a gig at the Jambalaya for the Point's Birthday on 11/11/11.

We hope you will take part in this contest. It is so exciting for us to be able to showcase our fine local talent and still hang in the realm of Classic rock. Please let me know as soon as you can if you are interested so I can create a slot for your band/talent. 

Thanks in advance. We look forward to hearing from you.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Biography
The Brothers Comatose formed in the Morrison Living Room, birthed from the sonic gumbo of the famous Morrison Music Parties. The band consists of Ben and Alex Morrison  hairy brothers, both singing, with Ben on Guitar, and Alex on banjo, Gio Benedetti on Bass / Vocals, Ryan Avellone on Mandolin and Philip Brezina on fiddle.

Their shows exude a foot-stomping, shout-along, drink-along ease that was once a staple in every music playing, front-stoop-possessing home in the land. Their shows cant help but remind folk that music is collective, is for dancing, is for sharing, and for whatever else you might do with friends and family in your own living room.

In less than 3 years the mighty quintet has made their way from the street corners and dive bars of their native San Francisco, to performances at such legendary places as the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, toured the U.S to the Eastern banks of the Mississippi, and shared stages with such acts as the Carolina Chocolate Drops, The Devil Makes Three, Justin Townes Earl, Trampled by Turtles, Greensky Bluegrass, John Doe and the Sadies and others.

The end of 2011 finds the band heading back to the studio to record their second full-length album. The new album is due out in spring 2012, and should be released just in time to launch the scruffy fellows on another tour in their 1988, red, Chevy G20 van, crisscrossing the country, spreading the love of dance, drink and song hither and tither, to and fro.

<td colspan="2"><font size="-1"><strong>UNSIGNED ONLY MUSIC COMPETITION DEADLINE IS FAST APPROACHING ON MARCH 5 2012 </strong></font></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Nashville, TN, USA - February 22, 2012 - The newly launched Unsigned Only Music Competition, from the team behind the International Songwriting Competition, is fast approaching its March 5 deadline for artists to enter. Designed for solo artists, bands, and singers who are not signed to a major record label, Unsigned Only's goal is to find an outstanding, talented performing artist: a band, singer, or solo artist...a newcomer or veteran...raw or polished - the "gem" that needs to be discovered. Unsigned Only is looking for the total package. Judging criteria includes vocals, performance, songwriting, and originality.<p>

Completely separate and distinct from ISC, Unsigned Only is a fresh and novel approach to other music competitions. Not only does it offer great prizes, recognition, exposure, and the chance to be heard by a group of judges consisting of high-profile recording artists and industry professionals, but it also takes it a step further and puts the Grand Prize winner in direct, personal contact with the influential record label executives who are the ultimate decision makers. For the first time ever, a music competition offers the Grand Prize winner the unprecedented opportunity to be mentored by a group of record company presidents, A&R reps, and more. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for an artist to directly network with the top echelon of record company professionals and get guidance, advice, feedback, and networking opportunities.
<p>
The founders of Unsigned Only, Jim Morgan and Candace Avery, talk about the new venture: "We are pleased to introduce a new music competition of this caliber to artists throughout the world. Having worked with a wide variety of artists over many years, we know that what artists want most is access to record label professionals. However, it is virtually impossible for most up-and-coming artists to have direct access to this elite and elusive group of decision makers. So, Unsigned Only is offering the unprecedented opportunity for the Grand Prize winner to network with and be mentored by a prestigious group of record label executives. This has never been done before, and we are excited about the possibilities it affords the Unsigned Only winner."
<p>

The judging panel is comprised of an impressive group of recording artists, producers, and top-level music journalists. They include: Cyndi Lauper; Kenny Rogers; Angie Stone; 3 Doors Down; Jeremy Camp; Manchester Orchestra; Craig Morgan; Robert Smith (The Cure); Kelly Clarkson; Musiq Soulchild; Aaron Shust; Steve Lillywhite (Producer); G. Love; Matt and Kim; St. Vincent; The Mountain Goats; Josh Jackson (Co-Founder and Editor-In-Chief, Paste Magazine); Scott Lapatine (Founder/Editor-In-Chief, Stereogum) and Lorraine Ali (Pop Music Editor, Los Angeles Times).
<p>
The panel of mentors who have signed on to participate is equally impressive. Included are: Monte Lipman (President of Universal Republic); Pete Ganbarg (Executive Vice President/Head of A&R, Atlantic Records); David Wolter (Senior VP of A&R, RCA Records); Kim Stephens (President, Forward Entertainment and A&R/Capitol Music Group); Trevor Jerideau (VP of A&R, RCA Records); David Wilkes (VP of A&R, eOne Music); Pete Giberga (Head of A&R, Razor & Tie Records) and Jason Geter (President, Grand Hustle Records).
<p>
The Grand Prize Winner will be awarded $5,000 in cash (plus additional prizes) and one-on-one mentoring by an elite group of record company executives. First Place and Second Place winners will also be selected in each category. Entries are being accepted now until March 5, 2012.  Winners will be announced in July, 2012. Categories include: AAA (Adult Album Alternative), AC (Adult Contemporary), Christian Music, Country, Folk/Singer-Songwriter, R&B/Hip-Hop, Rock, Pop/Top 40, and Vocal Performance.
<p>
All entries must be original music except for the Vocal Performance category which accepts original or cover songs. Judging criteria in the Vocal Performance category will be based solely on the quality of the vocals, thereby allowing singers who do not write their own songs the opportunity to enter.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">

ARCATA, CA  Seattles Tito Ramsey will be traveling to Arcata as part
of his two-week west coast tour to debut music from his
recently-released electro-soul-pop album. Titos creations are a
synergy of aggressive pop, electronica, and soul, often drawing
comparisons to Jeff Buckley and Little Richard. He has played shows in
London, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona and many cities around the US. He
has shared the stage with various well-known musicians, from The Head
and the Heart to jazz great Yusef Lateef. Tito Ramsey will perform
live at Blondies on February 28.
<P>
In college Tito studied modern jazz and composition, allowing him the
opportunity to study with Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, most well-known
for writing string arrangements for Marvin Gaye. Since then, he has
collaborated with hordes of talented musicians writing music for film
and theater, rock bands and a string quartet. But, in 2007, the loss
of a dear friend left Tito searching. He focused his energy on
exploring new ways to make music, collecting electronic instruments,
and honing a new sound. He has seamlessly blended this new obsession
with electronica and his older soulful writing. And now he cant stop
dancing.<P>

A delightful trip outside of our usual listening patterns&.With a
voice that can sound quite a bit like Win Butler, Hi Lo at its most
epic moments sounds a bit like what Arcade Fire might have sounded
like if they had come out in the synth heavy 80s.  Postcard Elba

<P>Meticulously-crafted beats and charisma as a soul man.  Another
Rainy Saturday<P>

Lyrically, rhythmically, sonically, and in terms of musical
complexity, this is smart, interesting, sophisticated music. But at
the same time  especially having seen Ramsey perform this stuff live,
pumping his head up and down manically as he switches between
keyboards, foot pedals, drum pads, and microphone  most of it is in
service to the rhythm.  Ball of Wax
<P>
See Tito Ramsey live at Blondies on February 28. Doors are at 7:30pm
and it will be FREE. The event is open to all ages.<P>

<P>
This weekend, on July 21 and 22, the Mateel Community Center will host the 28 th annual
Reggae On The River® at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area in Garberville, CA. A favorite pilgrimage
of reggae and roots fans worldwide, this annual event is also the main fundraiser of the non-profit

reclamation of the great Reggae On The River® tradition. A special farewell to Benbow, the 28th annual

home to its original Frenchs Camp venue in 2013.
Just cause for celebration (and your support to help achieve this goal), the event will showcase
a massive lineup featuring many of the top names in reggae and world music. Live from two stages,
the festival will host iconic artists from the far corners of the globe including Toots & The Maytals,
Midnite, Lady Saw, Romain Virgo, Calypso Rose, Turbulence, Oliver Mtukudzi & Black Spirits, Fantan
Mojah, Duane Stephenson, Nkulee Dube, Tosh Meets Marley, Pato Banton & The Now Generation,

Reggae On The River®, happening this weekend, July 21 and 22, at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area.

<tr><td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Hello friends and fans, a quick little update here about a show we have coming up this Saturday the 16th. For some reason it's been far too long since we've played our sister city of Eureka, but the time has finally come. We're glad to say that since we've played Eureka there have been a few new venues that have popped up and we couldn't be happier about that. We've had the opportunity to check out Siren's Song (325 2nd St.) a couple times and enjoy some amazing beers they have there (if you serve good beer, there's a good chance we'll ask to play your joint).

So come on down this Saturday and throw back a pint with us (after savoring it of course) and check out our good friends Drifter Killer at the show. Our thanks to them for asking us to play. Show time we think is around 9p. We'll see you there.

Cheers,

Formed in 2010, the group consisting of brothers Billy and Clyde Hargrove (bass and guitar, respectively), Ryan Robinson (drums), Jason Mills (keys), and Ansley Hughes (vocals) clicked from the start, sharing a similar vision for the bands sound.  By fostering and combining their individual strengths with each member contributing and writing songs on the new album, the band has truly come into their own with Hydrogen Child.




Deciding to work on the new songs with producer Cam Blackwood (Florence + The Machine, Coldplay, Morrissey), the band flew to London to record them; whereas Vesper Belle was all over the map musically, this time they wanted to concentrate on a sound that was the most representative of the band, resulting in a much more focused album.




"There is a definite cohesiveness insofar as the arrangement and lyricism," says guitarist Clyde Hargrove.  "We honed in on a few songs from Vesper Belle that we thought were most representative of the musical direction we are going, and used those as a benchmark for the tone of the album. Vesper Belle is much more eclectic in style and Hydrogen Child is more of a concept album."




The concept being transformation whether through love, death, or rebirth.




"There is an inherent and intended playfulness brought about by Ansley's vocal production and lyrical arrangement that creates purposeful and sometimes ironic dissonance against this landscape," Hargrove comments.




Following the album's completion in the summer of 2012, the band flew back to the States and hit the road on the Vans' Warped Tour, allowing them to preview the songs in front of an audience prior to the album's release&and the reaction was great. They also lent their writing and production skills to B.O.B's Strange Clouds with the track "Chandelier."




From the instantly hooky pop of "Sunday School Dress" to the build and undertow of "Anthem," a dreamy yet subdued melodic number, through the piano-driven eeriness of "Magnolia Parade," one listen to Hydrogen Child makes it clear that Super Water Sympathy can write a memorable pop song.




This is also evident on the anthemic "Purple Poppies," a sweeping, mid-tempo number that showcases the band's ability to mix orchestration with Hughes' voice, allowing her powerful pipes free range, but making sure the music is clear and crisp as well.




"We try to make the lyrics paint a picture, but at the same time to conflict and contrast the mood and landscape of the music, thus giving balance and harmony in the two textures," comments Clyde.  "Our band's sound is built around the ambience of Jason's pads against Ansley's voice.  We like to make things blend very deeply and high at the same time.  I would say our sound is ambient-pop-rock."




With comparisons bound to conjure up images of Coldplay, The Fray, and Florence + the Machine, regardless of what you think of those acts, Super Water Sympathy can play to the pop crowd, but Hughes' stage presence and commanding voice also ensures they fit right at home on Vans' Warped Tour, who has invited them back this year.




When asked how he feels the band has grown between the two records, Clyde isn't shy.  "Hydrogen Child came out a lot bigger and healthier than what we were imagining. Compared to Vesper Belle, this album was a big step forward," he says.  "We spent a lot of time working together in group-think sessions next to rivers and R.V. parks.  Most of the writing was done in group sessions as was the production rather than individual ideas.  We also adapted a unified idea of a concept and stuck to it."




"This album is much more of an organically collaborative effort as far as all the members go," he continues.  "A lot of Vesper Belle was the adaptation of a lot of our musical projects we had been working on before the band had formed to a certain ambient sound.  This album is the product of all of us writing together and knowing what we sound like, so the writing style is more congruent.  Although, there are some songs that certain members had heavier hands in, this album is a true band collaboration.  Every member of the band has written lyrics and music for this album."




One change in production that brought stellar results on Hydrogen Child is the band went for a lot more natural sounds with Hughes' voice. "We decided to not do much to Ansley's voice [in post-production]. We are suckers for reverb and delay, but we left  it pretty raw and dry - and it really came out nicely. She has such a viciously elegant voice that to let it stand alone against the wild seemed natural."




Hydrogen Child is truly a leap forward for Super Water Sympathy, and Water Pop has never sounded so good. The band plans on touring relentlessly across the United States (with plans to tour Europe, too) to expose and share their sound with the masses. Come check it out, the Water is just right&!

Fired up for yet another week of family-friendly, folksy, grin-filled events, the Humboldt Folklife Society's (HFS) summertime Folklife Festival is set to commence for the 35th time this Saturday night and run through July 20. Of course, this year's festivities includes the staples -- the Annie and Mary Day, a barn dance, songwriters night, country night, bluegrass night and the concluding all-day free festival -- but new to the festival this year will be a night of musical comedy, funny finger-pickin' if you will.

The spirit of the West is alive and well in the music of Los Angeles-based roots music collective The Dustbowl Revival. This rambling, rolling spirit is the same spark that lit a fire under the past two centuries of Westward migration in America. It comes from a need for wide-open vistas, rollicking street parties, laidback lifestyles, and communities that you build yourself. For the folks in The Dustbowl Revival, West Coast living suits them just fine. Their high-spirited blend of old school bluegrass, gospel, jug-band, swamp blues, piercing brass blasts, and the hot swing of the 1930s has made them one of the hottest roots music bands in LA and garnered them praise from the likes of tastemaker radio station KCRW, the Los Angeles Times, and alt-paper the LA Weekly! Thats what happens when you owe your allegiance to old-school inspirations like Louis Armstrongs Hot Sevens, Fats Wallers barrelhouse vibe, Bessie Smiths ass-kicking backroom blues, and New Orleans brass bands.  Growing steadily from a small string band playing up and down the west coast (hundreds of shows in the last two years), The Dustbowl Revival has blossomed into a traveling collective featuring instrumentation that includes fiddle, mandolin, trombone, clarinet, trumpet, banjo, accordion, tuba, pedal steel, drums, guitars, a bass made from a canoe oar, harmonica and plenty of washboard and kazoo for good luck. This aint no fake-mustached hipster revivalism here, The Dustbowl Revival are the real deal, shouting and hollering the nearly derailed, buzz-saw crazed music of the American South that first inspired them.


The Dustbowl Revivals new album, Carry Me Back Home, is a full-on assault on the idea that folk music should be in any way restrained or boring. They barrel through old-school songs like the spiritual Swing Low or the old stringband number New River Train, bringing a kind of raucous energy born from all-night parties and impromptu street parades. The biblical wailer John the Revelator gets a gin-soaked barroom reimagining here, with ceiling-scraping clarinet solos, and a creepy chorus line that would have done Son House proud. And the original songs rock just as hard as the traditional songs. Riverboat Queen blends the 1920s-influenced blues vocals of Caitlyn Doyle together with a Tom Waits cabaret feel that taps equally into the world of Balkan brass and accordions. Josephine veers into doo-wop, but with a decidedly cracked modern approach. Soldiers Joy may be an age-old song about the horrors of the Civil War, but lead singer and songwriter Zach Lupetin gives the song new words and a new feel to reflect the reality of modern warfare. Its part of a pattern that unites The Dustbowl Revivals many different influences: the old music traditions that inspire them are evoked not for some kind of vintage aesthetic, but because The Dustbowl Revival honestly believe that these old songs and sounds have a lot to say today. You can find the same burning energy that made the old recordings so electric in the Los Angeles city street music of The Dustbowl Revival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><br><div align="center"><img src="News/graphics/1094.jpeg" alt="The Dustbowl Revival plays Humboldt State University Quad, 9/27/13" border="0"></div></font>
