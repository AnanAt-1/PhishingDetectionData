<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first Interurban car ran through Delphos on Nov. 1, 1905,
while the last car to run on the line through town was June 30, 1932.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This 65 mile line ran from Lima to Ft. Wayne, Ind. It was a
fast route, entirely on private-right-of-way except for short stretches on city
streets in larger towns. From Lima, the trolley ran on the north side of the
Pennsylvania railroad to Delphos, where they came in on East Second Street and
ran down the center of the street. Leaving town on the west end, it crossed over
the Pennsy on the &quot;overhead,&quot; and ran along its south shoulder to
Middlepoint Road, which it paralleled on the south side. It perked up Ohio 116
running on the south edge into Van Wert. There it rumbled down Main Street then
running north back to the Pennsy, and then ran on its south side, through
Convoy.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At sunrise on Easter Sunday - March 27, 1910, the
&quot;Convoy Horror,&quot; as it was called for years, struck tragedy on the
line.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Car 82, westbound, pulled into Van Wert as Easter church
bells were chiming. At the depot, train dispatcher, Van Scoy, handed a train
order to Motorman Oscar Stewart and Conductor R.C. Treastor, which ordered them
to pull into a siding at Convoy, and wait for express Car 199, an extra on the
line.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was not done. After passing the station in Convoy, Car
82 rounded a curve at 6:41 a.m. and rammed head-on into 199. J. Pearl Pheron of
Lima, motorman on the express messenger of Lima was roasted to death under the
flaming debris. James Risk, assistant express messenger, suffered a broken leg
and internal injuries. Seven passengers of 82 were shaken up, but Stewart and
Treastor came out unscathed. The express car was demolished, and the passenger
car suffered fatal damage.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two weeks later, the Van Wert County Coroner found Treastor
and Stewart guilty of gross negligence and carelessness. This was just one of
many such tragedies that occurred on the single track interurbans.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The depot in Lima was located on the public square and a car
barn was located on the southwest corner of Grand Ave. and North Main St. While
in Delphos, the depot was located on East Second St., where WDOH radio station
is now. There was a siding leading to a loading dock across the street, next to
the alley where Community First drive-in bank is now located.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Middle Point, the depot was on Middlepoint Road on the
south edge of town. The building is still there and has been abandoned for
years.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Van Wert, the depot was located at the Marsh Hotel on Main
Street, and later was moved to Main and Cherry streets, at the site of what was
later the Diesel-Wemmer-Gilbert tobacco plant office.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Convoy, the depot appeared to be identical to the Middle
Point depot.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It cost 15 cents to ride from Delphos to Van Wert and Lima
and $1.50 to ride the full 165 miles between Lima and Ft. Wayne.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you were at a rural crossing at night and wanted the
trolley to stop, you would light a match to a newspaper and the conductor would
see it and stop.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One time, an interurban passenger asked the conductor if the
car would stop at the next crossing? He replied, &quot;Lady, if necessary we
will stop twice at a double house.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one period, Van Wert was voted, &quot;dry,&quot; while
Delphos was &quot;wet,&quot; or allowed to sell alcoholic beverages. On the
weekends, some of the cars would carry people coming from Van Wert to Delphos,
and on their return home they would carry containers full of beverages, and they
would be full also.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">J. S. Moulton stated that while riding the Ohio Electric car
from Lima to Ft. Wayne, at Van Wert, the Manhattan Limited on the Pennsy
Railroad, which parallels the traction line, came up, but we passed the steam
train and kept ahead of it.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On straight stretches, an interurban car could reach 80
miles-per-hour. Some of the 45 ton cars were powered by four 150 H.P. electric
motors from overhead electric wires.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the luxury features in most trolley cars were
electrically heated curling irons in the ladies toilet, electric fans in the
main compartment, and electric cigar lighters in the men's smoking room.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The service between Lima and Ft. Wayne consisted mainly of
two classes, local and limited. The local trains catered mainly to people
traveling to and from the country, these trains making stops any time they were
signaled. Limited trains made city and town stops only. Special cars would be
operated between any two points, for a guarantee of 50 adult fares.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 1906, the Lima and Toledo Traction Company leased
the Ft. Wayne-Lima route. In May 1907, the Ohio electric purchased the
Lima-Toledo, thereby acquiring its lease interest in the Lima-Ft. Wayne. Ohio
Electric continued to manage the line until 1921, when it reverted back to its
original owners: Ft. Wayne, Van Wert and Lima Traction Co. In October 1926, the
line was sold at bankruptcy auction for $150,000 to virtually the same owners.
It was then renamed the Ft. Wayne-Lima Railroad.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1930, the Indiana Railroad took it over. A feeble attempt
to fight the automobile was a plea in the last timetable, &quot;With 3 cents a
mile trolley fares, can you drive your car for that?&quot; The last car went
through Delphos on June 30, 1932. The cars were too nice to scrap and were sold
to the Oklahoma Railway. They ran with other Ohio cars there, until 1947 when
that system was scrapped.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one time, after the interurban closed, the Middle Point
Depot housed the Crawford Plymouth-Desota dealership. Later on McGinnis had a
machinery repair shop there.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the rules of the road, eastbound trains had the
right-of-way and there were sidings at certain places when trains could pass.
One was one-quarter mile west of Convoy, while another was located between
Middle Point and Delphos.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the cars had a baggage and freight compartment. There
were some strictly freight cars. At most, a trolley car might pull two more
cars.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lodges, clubs, churches and other groups often chartered a
car for outings.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Practically all interurbans were standard gauge, which means
the rails were 56 1/2 inches apart.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1905, the Dayton, Springfield and Urbana prided itself on
its ability to move horses on the cars with passengers using the front baggage
compartment.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The D.S. &amp; U. won national fame the same year when it
worked out an owl newspaper delivery service with the Dayton Journal. The daily
discovered that the roads were too muddy and rutty for dependable trucking of
newspapers so it bought an Oldsmobile truck, (remember this was 1905), and
attached railroad wheels to it. Papers were loaded on this truck and departed
Dayton at 3:30 a.m. A motorman was taught how to drive the Oldsmobile, and
rushed the papers to Springfield. Enroute, papers were hurled off at way
stations, at Dead Man's Crossing, Harshman and Osborn. In downtown Springfield,
15 carrier kids met the truck and the remaining paper were transferred to other
interurbans for early dawn runs to other towns. Record for the run was 48
minutes, with the makeshift truck hitting 50 m.p.h. often on its journey.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you come across a postcard showing an interurban car on a
track in Kenton, you have a very good collector's item, as Kenton never had an
interurban. They chartered a company in 1903, and the company laid 2.5 miles of
track in Detroit Street. Money ran out and the company never was able to find
more money. After the track was installed, Kenton was jubilant about the
prospect of trolley cars coming to town. Postcards were issued showing trolleys
superimposed on the track. Residents sent them to friends in distant cities,
proud that Kenton could boast of trolley cars.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the C.H. &amp; D. and other lines were bought out, a
new company was formed - the Cincinnati &amp; Lake Erie R.R. They bought some
new plush, lightweight cars christened &quot;Red Devils&quot;. There coaches
could actually reach 96 m.p.h. A race was staged between Car No. 122 and an open
cockpit biplane, with the car winning after hitting 97 m.p.h. After this, the
cameramen packed up and went to a straightway near Lafayette, where No. 122
challenged an Indianapolis Speedway race car. No. 122 won easily.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first interurban in Ohio was started at Newark in 1889.
The early interurbans were an extension of city horse-drawn car lines, into the
countryside to another town. Along the rural stops were little shanties and
platforms where farmers loaded milk, produce and poultry. Freight cars came
frequently to collect this merchandise and at night would return and deposit the
empty milk cans and chicken crates.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 217 mile Cincinnati-Toledo main line was the longest
through trolley run in the United States for years</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Independence Day, 1886 in Lima, horses and mules were
liberated.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first electric car in use west of the Allegheny mountains
made its first run in a driving rain storm. It was an amazing sight in those
days to see something on the streets, not pulled by horses or mules.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Middletown's Mule Transit</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1879, C.F. Gunkel started a horse railway, a 1.6 mile
route connecting the C.H. &amp; D. railroad depot on the west edge of town with
the Big Four line to the east of town.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company adopted a new name in the 1900s, when it found
that mules were capable of doing a superior job. It became the Rapid Mule
Transit Traction Co. Mules ate less and were less powerful, but did not need the
extra strength to pull Middletown's small cars.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Owners of the company were very happy with the mules and the
puffing steam trains kept bringing passengers with nickels to drop in the fare
boxes. The tinkling bells on the mules were an added attraction, making it seem
like Christmas all yearlong.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1913 flood washed away the Third Street Bridge so the
line west to the C.H. &amp; D. had to be abandoned and mules now ran only from
the Big Four Depot to Main Street.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Horse cars were unheard of in World War I days and travelers
stood in amazement as they watched the driver unhitch the mules from one end of
the car, and hook the animals up to the other end.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line became famous, and soon appeared on postcards with
the caption &quot;Modern Rapid Transit, Middletown, Ohio.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1918, the line was still rolling among hoards of
automobiles, strange contrast.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally the owners decided to replace the mule cars with
busses. The last trek was May 4, 1918. This was probably the last horse car in
the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Miami and Erie Canal Railway</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the turn of the century, Ohio's canal systems were in
their death throes. The Miami and Erie was largely used for ice skating in the
winter and fishing in the summer. Canal boats were too slow at 2 1/2 miles per
hour, as the railroad freight trains whizzed past at 25 mph.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trolly tow was hailed as the adrenaline that would rescue
the declining canal industry. The overjoyed State of Ohio gave its blessing to
convert the towpath into a railroad. This was a mammoth job.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line was opened 42 miles from Cincinnati to Middletown in
late 1903. There were seven road locomotives weighing 28 tons with two 80
horsepower electric motors. They were geared for a dragging pull of 6 mph. The
road engines had double hooks on each side to secure the barges. The erratic tow
path designed for mules, crisscrossed the canal at three points. Here, quick
working bridge tenders provided excitement as they swiftly opened the bridge
after the locomotive crossed to permit the barges to go unobstructed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of many factors, including washing out the canal
banks with waves, instead of 10-barge tows at 6 mph, five barge tows at 3 mph
were the maximum.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a year of look-see operation, the canal tow trolly line
was ordered junked. Wreckers removed the valuable copper and iron in 1905, and
the three-phase locomotives, unsaleable elsewhere, were junked.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Indianapolis, Columbus &amp; Eastern Traction Co.
purchased the Columbus &amp; Lake Michigan steam Railroad running from Lima to
Defiance, it took on a pathetic railroad, rich. in lore and shattered dreams.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Originally known as the Columbus, Lima &amp; Milwaukee, the
line was founded by Ben Faurot, a Lima citizen who was a self-made millionaire.
His money pyramided from the sale of mules to the Union Army during the Civil
War. He constructed the early electric Lima street car line. Lima was the first
city in northwestern Ohio to boast electric power, furnished by Faurot's
turbines. He owned paper mills an designed the great Faurot Opera House with
2,000 seating capacity. He donated Woodlawn Cemetery and laid out a ball park.
But Faurot's dreams were on railroading.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line was in planning stages for years, and finally
commenced again in 1898.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line struck northwest from Lima on private-right-of-way,
taking dead aim at Defiance It paralleled no roads, running through Kalida and
Continental enroute.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On April 10, 1905, regular passenger service started. Then on
Feb. 6, 1906, W. Kelsey Schoepf bought the line for a song and incorporated it
in the I.C.&amp; E. On Aug. 1, 1909, the first green electric car ran under the
Ohio Electric banner. A daily steam train was intermixed with the trollys.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lima-Defiance line was sold in 1923 to a Lima group. In
1926, wires were torn down, and a gasoline doodlebug and steam engines took to
the rails. In February 1929, notices went up at the stations that the line was
temporally abandoned. This meant forever, and the Faurot dream was buried in a
tangle of weeds.</p>
