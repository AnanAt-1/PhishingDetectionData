(Photo: <A href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/picturedisplay.asp?linkpath=pic%5CL%5CE%5CLenin_Vladimir.jpg">Vladimir Lenin</A>.) Russian revolutionary, founder of the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CO%5CBolshevik.htm"><!--NL-->Bolshevik</a> party, leader of the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CO%5CCommunist.htm"><!--NL-->Communist</a> revolution (see October Revolutuion of 1917), and head of the <!--NL-->Soviet state. After being expelled from Kazan <!--NL-->University he studied <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CM%5CA%5CMarxKarl.htm"><!--NL-->Karl <!--NL-->Marx</a> and adopted his ideas. Lenin made important additions to <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CM%5CA%5CMarxist.htm"><!--NL-->Marxist</a> doctrine in response to the demands of revolutionary practice. These additions form <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CL%5CE%5CLeninism.htm"><!--NL-->Leninism</a> which reveals Lenin's skill as a tactician and his political flexibility. A key contribution was the concept of the revolutionary party, developed first in his <I>What Is to Be Done?</I> (1902) and <I>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</I> (1904). Another was the concept of ‘democratic centralism.’ In <I>The State and Revolution</I> (1917) he justified his decision to seize power and to establish the ‘dictatorship of the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CP%5CR%5CProletariat.htm"><!--NL-->proletariat</a>.’ Lenin often reversed himself; he used the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CU%5CDumaState.htm"><!--NL-->State <!--NL-->Duma</a>, for example, as a propaganda forum, recognized briefly the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianNationalRepublic.htm"><!--NL-->Ukrainian <!--NL-->National <!--NL-->Republic</a>, established the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFarEasternRepublic.htm"><!--NL-->Far <!--NL-->Eastern <!--NL-->Republic</a> (1920–2) to further Bolshevik foreign policy, and introduced the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CE%5CNewEconomicPolicy.htm"><!--NL-->New <!--NL-->Economic <!--NL-->Policy</a> (1921) to restore the economy.</P><P>Lenin accepted violence and <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CT%5CE%5CTerror.htm"><!--NL-->terror</a> as legitimate tools of <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CL%5CClass.htm"><!--NL-->class</a> war. He created the <!--NL-->Soviet security <!--NL-->police, the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CH%5CCheka.htm"><!--NL-->Cheka</a>. He established the prototype of the totalitarian dictatorship, which tried to remake society and <!--NL-->human nature and claimed the right to control all aspects of life. Lenin's ideological teachings and organizational methods paved the way for <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CS%5CT%5CStalinJoseph.htm"><!--NL-->Joseph <!--NL-->Stalin</a>'s brutal dictatorship.</P><P>His initial indifference and even hostility to the nationality issue expressed itself in his rejection of the ethnic criterion in party organization, his opposition to the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CJ%5CE%5CJewish.htm"><!--NL-->Jewish</a> <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CU%5CBund.htm"><!--NL-->Bund</a>, and his commitment to centralism. The <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CL%5CClass.htm"><!--NL-->class</a> struggle ruled out any national loyalties. He perceived ‘national culture’ as an instrument of the national bourgeoisie (<a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CL%5CA%5CLandowners.htm"><!--NL-->landowners</a>, <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CP%5CR%5CPriests.htm"><!--NL-->priests</a>, and the bourgeoisie). Lenin never visited <!--NL-->Ukraine and only slowly acquired some understanding of its peculiar position. By 1912 he had associated <!--NL-->Ukraine with <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CP%5CO%5CPoland.htm"><!--NL-->Poland</a> and Finland in his criticism of tsarist policies. Although he condemned <!--NL-->nationalism, he paid lip service to the <!--NL-->right <!--NL-->of <!--NL-->national <!--NL-->self-<!--NL-->determination, including independence, assuming all the time that it would not be exercised. He saw <!--463L-->ethnic <!--463L-->assimilation as ‘progressive,’ although he acknowledged the right of each people to use its own language and advocated language tolerance. Lenin believed that the <!--12609L-->right <!--12609L-->of <!--12609L-->national <!--12609L-->self-<!--12609L-->determination would be transformed dialectically into its opposite, and that ‘sometimes greater bonds obtain after free separation.’ He denounced Ukrainian socialists, such as <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CO%5CDontsovDmytro.htm"><!--NL-->Dmytro <!--NL-->Dontsov</a> and <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CY%5CU%5CYurkevychLev.htm"><!--NL-->Lev <!--NL-->Yurkevych</a> (<!--NL-->L. <!--NL-->Rybalka), for advocating a separate <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianSocialDemocraticWorkersparty.htm"><!--NL-->Ukrainian <!--NL-->Social <!--NL-->Democratic <!--NL-->Workers' <!--NL-->party</a>. He replied with abuse when <!--NL-->Rybalka pointed out the inconsistency between Lenin's acceptance of national <!--13604L-->self-<!--13604L-->determination and his belief in the progressiveness of large states and in their continued existence. <!--NL-->Rybalka had argued that the professed internationalism of the Bolsheviks was a veiled form of traditional Russian <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CI%5CM%5CImperialism.htm"><!--NL-->imperialism</a>: Lenin's talk of the ‘fusion of nations’ and his desire to prevent the breakup of <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CU%5CRussia.htm"><!--NL-->Russia</a> were incompatible with his promise of national <!--NL-->self-<!--NL-->determination. <!--NL-->Russia's collapse in 1917 compelled Lenin to confront the nationalities question on the practical level. He criticized the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CP%5CR%5CProvisionalGovernment.htm"><!--NL-->Provisional <!--NL-->Government</a> for refusing to grant Ukraine <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CA%5CU%5CAutonomy.htm"><!--NL-->autonomy</a> and used Ukrainian grievances to weaken the central government. But upon coming to power he adopted a hostile attitude to Ukrainian independence: he launched an invasion of Ukraine in January 1918. Although he was forced to recognize Ukraine's independence in the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CR%5CBrest6LitovskPeaceTreatyof.htm"><!--NL-->Peace <!--NL-->Treaty <!--NL-->of <!--NL-->Brest-<!--NL-->Litovsk</a>, he sent the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CE%5CRedArmy.htm"><!--NL-->Red <!--NL-->Army</a> into Ukraine again in January 1919 and again in late 1919. To win Ukrainian support for the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CO%5CBolshevik.htm"><!--NL-->Bolshevik</a> regime he set up a nominally <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CA%5CU%5CAutonomous.htm"><!--NL-->autonomous</a> Ukrainian <!--NL-->Soviet government and promised to promote the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianlanguage.htm"><!--NL-->Ukrainian <!--NL-->language</a> and culture. After consolidating his control over the peoples of the former <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CU%5CRussianEmpire.htm"><!--NL-->Russian <!--NL-->Empire</a>, Lenin adopted, out of regard for their national feelings, a federated instead of a unitary form of state, in 1922. He pointed to Russian great-power chauvinism as the cause of <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CA%5CNationalism.htm"><!--NL-->nationalism</a> in the smaller nations of the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CS%5CUSSR.htm"><!--NL-->USSR</a>. Some of his tactical opinions on the nationality problem provided the basis for the <!--NL-->Soviet policy of <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainization.htm"><!--NL-->Ukrainization</a> that was introduced in 1923. After 72 years of near idolatry, Lenin is finally being seen for the <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CI%5CM%5CImperialist.htm"><!--NL-->imperialist</a> and dictator that he really was. Since the end of 1990 open criticism of Lenin and what he stood for has spread through Ukraine and resulted in the dismantling of Lenin monuments in most cities.</P><P>BIBLIOGRAPHY<BR>Fischer, L. <I>The Life of Lenin</I> (<!--NL-->New York 1964)<BR>Possony, S. <I>Lenin: The Compulsive Revolutionary</I> (<!--NL-->Chicago 1964)<BR>Dziuba, I. <I><!--NL-->Internationalism or <!--NL-->Russification?</I> (<!--NL-->London 1968)<BR>Rybalka, L. <I>Rosiis’ki sotsial-demokraty i natsional’ne pytannia</I> (<!--NL-->Munich 1969)<BR><I>V.I.
