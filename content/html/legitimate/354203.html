	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>it doesn't lead... as the saying goes.<div><br /></div><div>A 16 year old Asian teenager was stabbed and passed away last night in San Francisco. One of my Case Managers notified me of the incident and I verified the facts with a staff who works in the wraparound service in SF General. So I went on SF Gate news online to read the news reporting. The staff writer wrote that a 16 year old teenager was stabbed to death by a 18 year old man. That statement made me pause to think how media can portray things base on what it wants readers to feel and believe. How can a 16 year old be called a teenager and a 18 year old called a man? The last time I check Sixteen and Eighteen both end with teen. So they should both be Teenagers. Where's the man comes in? I'm just saying... Then when I look at the same news again at night time, the whole story changed. That's online media for you.</div><div><br /></div><div>On another note, a Chinese World Journal reporter expressed to me that in her 20 or year career, this is the youngest Asian homicide victim that she's aware of. The Asian community is definitely shaken up by this tragedy since there's very few murders in its history. Unlike the African American and Latino American communities where young people are killing young people all the time. That's another reality.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's a sad reminder that life is short. I hope everyone gets that message.</div><div><br /></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>"We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun. ... When human society advances to the point where classes and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars, counter-revolutionary or revolutionary, unjust or just; that will be the era of perpetual peace for mankind. Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the desire to eliminate all wars; herein lies the distinction between us Communists and all the exploiting classes."<div><br /></div><div>A friend gave me the English version of Quotations from Chairman Mao Tsetung many years ago when I was in San Quentin. I remember reading the Chinese version when I was in elementary school in China. I didn't understand the meanings of what I was reading. Now I can comprehend the depth of Mao's analysis.</div><div><br /></div><div>I picked up the book from the book shelf and randomly came across the passage where Mao spoke about War that I found worth sharing.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 New Year at the Q
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Different cultures have different superstitions. One of the superstitions in Asian culture is it's bad luck to go visit a prison. It's one thing if you have loved ones locked up and you're visiting them. It's all bad if you just go visit a prison.<div><br /></div><div>In the past, I had encourage some youth to go visit San Quentin so they can get an ideal what life is like so they won't do things that land them there. However, most of the Asian youth don't want to go because of superstition. Their parents don't approve of them going for the same reason.</div><div><br /></div><div>For me, I would like to think that I transcend all superstition. Therefore, I went to visit San Quentin this afternoon to brainstorm on setting up a culture competent program to help the Asian and Pacific Islander prisoners. One of the prisoners showed me a "lai shi" he received from an older prisoner. "lai shi" is good luck money that married people or elders give to the youngsters in a red envelop during new year celebration. Since there's no red envelop in prison, they guy use a paper towel and shaded with red color pencil to make the envelop. For money, he put a prison photo ducat (Photo ducat is used in the visiting room to take pictures with visitors. It's sell through the Prison Canteen.,) which worth two dollars, inside the envelop. I asked the guys whether all the Asians are going to have a spread to celebrate the new year. They said everyone's too busy working and going to self help programs. They may do something over the weekend.</div><div><br /></div><div>Culture is important. For those who are incarcerated, they still observe their cultures as much as they can. Therefore, it's important to have cultural specific programs cater to their needs to reduce recidivism.</div><div><br /></div><div>Again, I'm grateful that I can walk out of the prison each time I visit. Each visit gives me perspective and makes me more appreciative of freedom.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I maintain contact with a few people in the Pen. Whenever I have time I would write to them. I still remember how good it felt to get a letter from the "free world." Receiving letters from family and friends is one way to maintain contact and ties with the community. It also means that people in prison are not forgotten.<div><br /></div><div><div>Today, I receive a letter from a life term prisoner who I had done time with. I met up with him during my visit to Vacaville Medical Facility with the San Francisco Reentry Council a few months ago.</div><div><br /></div><div>I just want to share an except of what he wrote: "I was denied parole because of weak parole plans. What a bomer, I took them 29 1/2 years [with] 25 years of that was clean time, no write ups, or disciplinary action and I was denied parole for three more years under a law that became active literally about a week before I went to the parole board on 4-3-09. Marsey Law, huh, what a rip off. Here it is 2011 and I go back to the board next year 2012, so really have to dot my i and cross my ts."</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, it's good to know that he has not giving up hope. </div></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>As part of my way of appreciating the legacy of Dr. King's dream, I participated in the Know Your Rights event that the Bay Area Youth Commissions organized and sponsored by Lick-Wilmerding High School's Center for Civil Engagement.<div><br /></div><div>I had the privilege of kick start the event with a poem and got approximately 250 people chanting Peace, Love and Community. However, I was inspired by the young poet Chinaka Hodge who let her words flow like a series of soothing melody. Then I was able to conduct a workshop on the importance of knowing your rights. When it was time for the participants to choose which workshop to go to, mine was the less popular. I'm sure me being an ex-con definitely had something to do with it. Fortunately, the twelve of so people in my workshop appreciated my sharing.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's good to see so many young people who are doing their part to live up to Dr. King's dream of equality for all. Many of them will definitely be leaders who will lead this country.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Feeling Naked

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Something didn't seem right this morning when I got to work. I felt a sense of lightness. I didn't know what caused that feeling until I reached for my waist and realized my work cell phone wasn't there. I had left it charging at home. The first thought came to my mind was, "The phone's going to be blown up with missed calls and messages." Then I just accepted the fact that I'm going to be without phone for the day.<div><br /></div><div>I carry two phones with me daily, one's personal and the other for work. I wish I could combine the two, but personal and professional have to be separated.</div><div><br /></div><div>When I got home, I did received some calls and messages. I totally forgot that I had an appointment for an interview on the phone. I didn't like missing the call.</div><div><br /></div><div>Cell phone has been apart of my life for almost four years. I did feel a little naked without it.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I was invited by the San Francisco Interfaith Council's (SFIC) Executive Director Michael Pappas as a guest speaker with Reentry Policy Director Jessica Flintoff at its monthly breakfast.<div><br /></div><div>About 80 people from different faith based groups were present at the St. Mark's Lutheran Church Heritage Hall. I shared my poem "Autobiography @ 33" with them as an introduction. I spoke briefly about the importance of all communities coming together to help those who are incarcerated. I drew the parallel on how the prisoners are being treated like lepers in the leper colony of Prison Industrial Complex. Many of the community members reached out to me when I was in prison just as Jesus reach out to the lepers in the leper colony. Without the compassion demonstrated by people from the community, I would not have become who I am.</div><div><br /></div><div>Members of SFIC are doing many great things helping people who are in need in our community. I want to encourage the interfaith council to play an active role in changing the policy that can steer California away from being number 1 in incarceration and number 50 in education.</div><div><br /></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The irritation in my eyes were bothering me so I decided to take a day off. I rarely take time off from work since it seems like I have never ending work to do.

I washed laundry, organized mail, paid my bills, cancelled my U verse internet service, went to the Post Office to return equipment and brought stamps, went to the bank to check my account balance, cooked a pot of soup and made dinner. I rode the stationary bike for 30 minutes, showered and ate dinner.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was so caught up in doing all the chores that I forgot to go to the  neighborhood town hall meeting.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Since everyone is making a big deal about today's date being 1/11/11, I figure I will document some of the things that transpired for me.<div><br /></div><div>Today happens to be the day I have to check in with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement.) I have to report to ICE every three months. So at 9 o'clock in the morning, my co-worker drove me to Sansome Street to do my check in. I wanted to do it early so I can be at work on time and I wanted to beat the crowd. However, when I went to the designated window on 5th floor, there're too many people waiting to get their paperwork sign. so I decided to go back later.</div><div><br /></div><div>I went back a couple of hours later, it was just routine. The ICE agent sign off on my paper and gave me a new date to go back in 3 months.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's Tuesday so I went to CYA Chad to do my workshop with the IMPACT program. We're doing the Addiction module this series. The lead facilitator and I went to two different units to give an introduction of the module. It's good to have two groups of captivated audience. A staff sat in our circle. Later he expressed how much he appreciates us for providing this program for the youth.</div><div><br /></div><div>I enjoyed the ride to and from Chad. I get to talk to my co-facilitator and friend Sterling. We often reminisce how life's twist and turn got us in the positions we're in.

    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Many years ago when I was still in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, I was locked up in Yuba County Jail in Marysville, California. ICE contracts with different county jails to keep people who are going through the deportation process in their custody. Out of boredom and a need for outside human connection, I would call some of my friends using the prepaid telephone card to talk to them. One of my male friends was always there to pick up the phone and happily chatted with me about any random things. He would also send me money to buy food and load up on my phone minutes. I always appreciate him for being there whenever I needed him.<div><br /></div><div>Tonight, I received a call from Yuba County Jail. It's my friend who was always there to pick up my call. ICE detained him and ordered his deportation to China after he lost his case. He has a wife and two toddlers at home. He doesn't know whether when he will be deported or when ICE will release him on supervision. He's waiting for luck to come.</div><div><br /></div><div>We talked about the most random things for thirty minutes so he can kill some boredom. I'm grateful that he called.</div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I was walking toward city hall on Larkin Street in San Francisco observing my surroundings in the afternoon. All of sudden, a white bearded man with a backpack came into my line of vision. What I saw next made me flabbergasted. The man took off his pants, squadded half way and defecated on the side walk in the middle of the street. Then he wiped himself with a tissue, pulled up his pants and walked away as it's a normal thing to do.<div><br /><div>Though I was shocked by what had transpired, I see dog poop and human poop daily when I go to work. The many alleyways in the Tenderloin District have been public animal and human bathrooms for years.</div><div><br /></div><div>The only way I see that can stop all those madness is fundamentally covering the basic needs for people: housing, jobs, and food.</div></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>It's definitely a night of celebration in San Francisco politic today. Ed Lee, who is the City Administrator received 10 to 1 vote to become the first Chinese American Mayor in San Francisco.<div><br /></div><div>Jane Kim had her community celebration party in Chinatown to prepare for her term as the first Korean American Board of Supervisor in San Francisco. Everyone who is anyone from the city political scene was there, except for outgoing Board of Supervisor Chris Daly. Too much drama going on there.</div><div><br /></div><div>I spoke with Mayor Willie Brown and thanked her for his support.</div><div><br /></div><div>I thanked Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi for his support of my pardon. He said that I made it easy for him to support me. He expressed that he strongly believe in reentry. He said that we never talk one on one and suggested that we should get together. I told him I will contact his office to set up a time to meet. I look forward to exchanging ideal with him on different issues effecting the incarcerated. I appreciate his openness.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's good to see Asian Americans being more involve in politic, especially young people. I look forward to working with them in some capacity. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>So as I was looking for parking on the way to a press conference, I noticed my boss in her car writing something. After parking my car, I approached her to find out what she's doing. She told me a truck hit her car. I noticed a huge dent on the back door of the driver side. I started taking pictures of the damage and the truck parked behind her.<div><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13.3333px; ">Then a truck stopped and parked across the street, the Caucasian man in the driver seat yelled at me, "If you think the truck behind you hit your car, you're wrong. I work for the same company. The truck has been parked here."</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span><div>I looked at the damaged car in front of me and said to him, "Are you for real? I'm looking at the damage right here."</div><div>So the guy yelled over to his coworker who's busy writing down insurance information, "Armando, did you hit that car?" Armando responded, "Yes, I did."</div><div>The guy said to me, "Oh, congratulations." Then he proceeded to apologize to me three different times.</div><div>So I'm trying to make sense of what had transpired. Armando, who's driving a truck hit my boss's car. They were exchanging insurance information. I arrived at the scene to take pictures of the damage. Then, another driver, who works for the same company as Armando, driving a similar truck stopped and parked across the street. He immediate defends his coworker stating that the accident did not happened. Yet, he was not at the scene when the accident occurred. Then he apologizes after his coworker admit he was at fault.</div><div>What was all that about?</div><div><br /></div><div> </div></div></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>"It's been 29 years. When are going to come visit GuMa? I saw everyone else in the family except you." GuMa asked me over the phone.<div><br /></div><div>How time flies!? The last time I saw Guma, my Dad older sister, was when I was 12 years old in 1982. We're at the training station in the city of GuangZhou, China.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you remember the piggy bank of coins you gave me before you left?" GuMa started talking away. "I didn't use any of it. I put those coins in rolls and saved them. I still have them in the village." I can't believe GuMa still remembers everything so vividly. She's already 85 years old. I was closest with GuMa out of the family. She helped take care of me when I was a kid. I gave her all my savings before I left for USA.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have to tell GuMa it's not that I don't want to go visit her or forgot about her. I don't have a passport to go anywhere. I told her that whenever I am able to adjust my immigration status and travel abroad, the first person I want to see in China is GuMa. </div><div><br /></div><div>Yet, the reality is, I don't know if I will ever see GuMa again. That's why I wish that she will live to be a hundred years old. That way, hopefully I can fix my status within 15 years and go visit GuMa.</div><div><br /></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
