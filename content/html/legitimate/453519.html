<H3>Settlement</H3>
Victoria&nbsp;was proclaimed a separate colony in 1851.<br />
<br />
East St Kilda&nbsp;commenced to be settled in the 1850s. The area of Glen Eira was once swamps, with farms in the northern area and market gardens in the south. Dirt tracks wound through the swamps and sandy heaths of the district. They were constantly damaged by farmers' cart wheels, creating dangerous holes and making access difficult.<br />
<br />
In 1853 the Victorian Parliament&nbsp;passed an Act to give authority to locally elected people to extract rates from residents in order to finance road construction. Residents lobbied for a roads district to be proclaimed to ensure that roads were maintained and passable.<br />

The first railway link to the area were at Caulfield&nbsp;and Carnegie railway stations, which opened in 1879, to be followed in 1881 by Glenhuntly&nbsp;and Ormond railway stations.<br />

For the first 25 years of Caulfield's municipal life, board/shire members met in "Mood Kee", the house of Cr Harold Pennington. He was paid 10 pounds a year to cover the cost of candles, fuel and the room. The annual general meeting was held in a tent in the backyard.

Road conditions were just one the major challenges to face the elected bodies in a developing area. As the farms and market gardens gave way to housing and the district's population grew, street lighting (originally gas), drainage, sewerage, rubbish collection, tips and other services were provided.<br />
<br />
Today, the City of Glen Eira is an established area. Glen Eira City Council is responsible for maintaining an ageing infrastructure and strives to update with works on roads, drains and footpaths.<br />

Public health issues have always been a key part of Council's activities. A clean water supply and sanitary removal of sewage was critical last century because of outbreaks of disease, such as typhoid, diphtheria and scarlet fever.

Providing public open spaces has also been a long tradition. Paddy's Swamp (now Caulfield Park) was set aside as a reserve in the 1880s. Many other sites once used as tips were turned into parks and gardens. Some parks were provided partly to cater for the large crowds at municipal band performances.

<H3>Names</H3>
<b>Caulfield</b><br />
<br />
The origin of the name of Caulfield is not known for certain, but the name seemed to be linked with Baron Caulfeild&nbsp;of Ireland, perhaps through John Caulfield, a pioneer of the colony.<br />
<br />
The name 'Caulfield' was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse. It was not in general use for the whole area until the proclamation of the Caulfield Road District in 1857.<br />
<br />
<b>Moorabbin</b><br />
<br />
The name "Moorabbin" derives from an Aboriginal word which principally means 'a resting place'. The proper name is probably 'moorooboon', a term used by the tribal group of the area, the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("36660",this,"bunurong.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("36660")' href="/topics/Bunurong">Bunurong</a><span class="hp" id="m36660"><div class="hpHeader">Bunurong</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i36660"></div>The Bunurong  are Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who occupy South-Central Victoria, Australia. Prior to European settlement, they lived as all people of the Kulin nation lived, sustainably on the land, predominantly as hunters and gatherers, for tens of thousands of years...</div><br></span>. The first European settlers may have found 'moorooboon' difficult to pronounce and accordingly corrupted the word for ease of use. The name Moorabbin applied from the earliest days of the Port Phillip settlement and remains today.<br />

The <i>Glen Huntly</i> was forced to land at Little Red Bluff (now Point Ormond) and Victoria's first quarantine station was formed to deal with the crisis.  Supplies and provisions were brought down what is now Glen Huntly Road and the small town was formed.<br />

Until recently Glen Huntly was spelt 'Glenhuntly'. The Council voted to change the spelling of the name of the suburb and of the road that bears the name to bring it to the historical spelling.
