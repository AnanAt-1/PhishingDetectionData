BTW, if the game runs too slow for you, you can try switching from 3D mode to 2D mode. Press Ctrl-Alt-D (enables debug mode), and then press F8. You should see a message telling you the game is in 2D mode.<br />

Only while this game giveaway is active.  It ends at 8am GMT  12 midnight PST  You can only download the  game while it is active and  it must be registered within the 24 hour period of the giveaway.  After that  it will no longer be available.  Check out the end of my review @ comment #1  I've posted a link to a load of  free HOG's, most of which are better than todayâs giveaway.  The only negative  with those freebies is that  when you close the game down   your browser is opened to MyPlayCity.  also when installing those games you must    watch out for toolbar installers and   home page hijackers.  You simply have to  uncheck   the check boxes to ensure they aren't   accessed.</p>

haha,  thats really funny, I've just been discussing this very  subject with pavid on Skype and totally agree with you.  I really don't know how HOG's have become so popular?  There are more HOG's released on a weekly basis than any other genre of game.  That said, there are   some newer HOGs that have follwed   the trend with Match 3  games such as Puzzle Quest 2 and Gyromancer (which is  on a  66% off deal today over on Steam)  that have incorporated  RPG elements into  the game play to transform the Match 3 genre into something far more interesting.  The recent HOG's that I've checked out  have been   a lot more interesting and  quite playablesuch as Mishap: An Accidental Haunting and Mishap 2: An Intentional Haunting</p>

Check that the archive is the correct size  by right clicking on it then selecting properties.  From the general tab you shoul see the actual and size on disc (110Mb - 116.129.792 bytes - size on disk).  The downloads have been excruciatingly slow today.  you may have  not got a complete download or it may have become corrupted.

thanks for  reposting Mr Snoozles  comment.  It's actually been repeated several times.  I keep meaning to copy it to  the FAQ's I've been working on  for the past   year.  I should post it soon then just add to it as and when new  questions arise.  (My problem is I   like to complete  a jo before posting. I once   spent  nearly 2 years  writing a review of Battlefield 2.  It included  all the  available mods and descriptions of all of the available custom made maps with images of the actual  maps and in game  screenshots as well as download links     from several sources for each map (There were several hundred maps).  I'd linked common   maps  via hyperlinks  and  cross referenced  information to make it very interactive and   although it was a very comprehensive review   (over 1200 pages) I never did  upload it to the Battlefield  mod sites because I felt it wasn't finished)</p>

No the  archive should be 110Mb in size.  The download times for this   file ave been excruciatingly slow today.  It took over an hour  to download  what would normaly take  less than 2 minutes.  You've almost certainly only got  a part of   the download.  <br />

Yes I agree with you.  HOG's have moved up several notches since this was  made.  At the time of it's release this would probably have been considered a much better  game than it is ow.  As with most genres   developers have had to come up with new formulaes to  keep the  community interested.  I'm amazed at the quality of some of the latest HOG games.  todays giveaway seems like a cheap imitation in comparison.</p>

It was only three years ago when all arcade games  cost $19.99.  since the  recession hit  games have dropped in price dramatically and many of the bigger games (i.e. triple a games)  are  cheaper than   arcade games once they've been out for a year or more, for example   when Steam has    a big sale you can often get games like the complete civilization IV games for  around $5 or Oblivion (Elder Scrols IV0 for  the same. both of which are  far superior games to   most arcade games.  <br />
<br />
That said I agree with you on the price of this game.  you can get far superior HOG games from Big fish for  less than $7</p>

I have a   10Mb broadband connection 9granted not  fast by todays standard, but usually  it would  have taken less than 2 minutes to download, today it took over an hour.  as mentioned  above, there have been more downloads than usual, so the  servers would have been oversubscribed.</p>

Yes there are only four files within the installed games folder.  Bass.dll (92KB), Jane Croft exe (2.96Mb), Main Pak (110Mb) and a splash jpg file  (28.0KB)  Total file size once installed 113Mb  (119.369.728bytes size on disk).  Try  one of the following:<br />
<br />
1) .. Download the latest  video drivers for your video card/video chip - if you're not sure  what your card/chip is   go to the start menu and    type  dxdiag in the search  field (or in XP  the run command).  This opens up the directX diagnostics panel.  click on the display tab.  In the left hand Device panel you should be able to see the Name (for example NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275), Manufacturer and Chip Type as well as other info such as approx total Memory  your current display mode etc.  Using this information you should be able to  download  the correct  vdeo driver for your computer.  The driver is  more than likely to be either NVIDIA or ATI.  Google    whichever one it is  and go to their home page.  you should find a link to the developers  driver section   on the front page.  you'll be asked to give  info such as the model number and  your operating system.  downloads are usually around  160Mb, but no more than 200Mb.  <br />
<br />
2) ... change your screen resolution<br />
<br />
3) ... Reinstal directX - Depending upon which operating system you use   this may be  DX11 (Win 7), DX10 (Vista) or DX9  (Win XP)  If for example you have win 7 firstly try  downloading and installing the latest version of directX11.  If that fails   download and install the latest version of  DX9.0c<br />
<br />
4) ...  you may need to install OpenGL (assuming your Graphics Driver supports it.  the latest version is OpenGL 4, but you'll need to have the latest  graphics chips for that one.  Usually OpenGL 2.0 is sufficient)  google it  to download<br />
<br />
5) ... Defrag your hard drive - sometimes if   a drive is heavily fragmented it can cause errors  in a program when running it.</p>

Sorry about the long delay in moderating this and all comments below this.  I fell asleep and have only just woken up after almost 6 hours. <br />
<br />
The game should auto save  your progress   once you've completed a level.  Leaving the game partway thrugh a level will require you to redo that particular level, but  you should be a ble to continue from the last completed  level.  I hope this answers your question?</p>

Try using a different file archiver such as 7-Zip or J-Zip to unpack the program.  Or  re-download using a file download manager to ensure you get an uncorrupted download.</p>
