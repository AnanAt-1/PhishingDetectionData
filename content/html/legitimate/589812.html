      an independent agile person who is confident to explore their environment

<P> <FONT SIZE="+1"> Observing the development of children can be fascinating. 
  Each child is a unique individual. Children develop as they grow and learn new 
  complex skills. The sequence of development is the same for all children. An 
  individual's ability progresses at different rates depending on inherited characteristics 
  and the nurturing that child receives. Growth and development will progress 
  well when a child's basic needs for food, warmth, sleep, exercise, encouragement 
  and love are met by reliable adult carers. </font></P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"> 
<P> Development is holistic including physical, intellectual, emotional and social 
  aspects. These areas of development are integrated into a whole special individual. 
</P>
<P> Observing a child's unique development is a rewarding skill to learn. As with 
  all new skills observation requires practice. Please come and see each separate 
  page for more information on interesting things to observe in a child's development.
