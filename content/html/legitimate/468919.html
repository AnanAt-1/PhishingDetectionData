THE  universal  interest,  felt  in  the  romantic  and 
tragical  career  of  Mary  Stuart  seemed  to  demand  an 
American  biography,  adapted  to  the  popular  mind. 
Such  a  work  the  one  now  offered  to  the  public  was 
designed  to  be.  The  authors  mainly  consulted  and 
quoted  are,  Mrs.  Strickland,  Miss  Benger,  Mignet, 
McCrie,  and  Hume.  Some  of  these  historians,  in 
their  unqualified  and  extravagant  admiration  of  the 
Queen  of  Scots,  apologize  for  every  fault,  and  illus- 
trate glowingly  every  virtue.  Others  lean  to  the  de- 
fence of  Elizabeth,  at  the  expense  of  Mary's  cause. 

Both  extremes  have  been  avoided  in  purpose,  if  not 
in  fact,  in  this  biography.  Less  pure  and  loving  than 
Josephine,  Mary  Stuart  was  more  beautiful,  and 
tossed  on  more  tempestuous  seas;  a  weary  captive, 
she  laid  at  length  her  crowned  head  on  the  execu- 
tioner's block,  affording  an  historical  record,  and  a 
moral  lesson,  none  can  contemplate  without  benefit 
to  the  intellect  and  to  the  heart. 


LIFE  OF  MAEY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 


CHAPTER  I. 

THE  name  of  Mary,  like  that -of  Josephine,  awak- 
ens a  universal  and  mournful  interest.  Born  to  roy- 
alty, she  was  the  most  beautiful  and  accomplished 
sovereign  in  the  world  during  a  stormy  period  of  the 
Scottish  monarchy,  and  after  a  captivity  of  nearly 
half  of  her  life-time,  died  on  the  scaffold,  in  the  full 
maturity  of  her  womanhood ;  illustrating  the  muta- 
bility of  "  all  things  terrene,"  and  how  great  a  mis- 
fortune may  be  the  heritage  of  greatness.  The  pen- 
insula of  Northern  Britain,  which  was  the  mountain- 
ous home  of  the  Gaelic  race,  after  the  ceaseless  war 
of  clans  for  centuries,  and.  invasions  of  the  Saxons, 
Angles,  and  Danes,  became  an  independent  monarchy 
about  the  middle  of  the  fourteenth  century,  when 
David  II.  ascended  the  throne  founded  by  his  illus- 
trious father,  Robert  Bruce.  An  alliance  with 
France  *  modified  the  severe  manners  of  the  Scottish 
nobility,  and  opened  a  refuge  for  the  unfortunate 
Mary.  Of  the  four  kings  who  reigned  before  Mary's 

*  This  alliance  was  cemented  by  the  two  successive  mar- 
riages of  James  V.  of  Scotland,  father  of  Mary  Queen  of  Scots, 
with  two  daughters  of  Francis  I.  of  France.  See  the  second 
paragraph  below.

father  took  the  sceptre,  James  I.  and  James  III.  died 
by  the  bands  of  the  assassin,  and  James  II.  and  James 
I  V.  were  slain  in  battle.  James  V.  succeeded  to  the 
throne  in  1513,  then  only  eighteen  months  old,  under 
the  regency  of  Margaret  of  England,  his  mother. 

The  biography  of  Mary  Stuart,  therefore,  has  not 
only  the  interest  of  tragedy,  but  is  a  focal  point  in 
history,  in  which  the  past  and  present  meet,  with  an 
intensity  of  life,  perhaps,  unknown  in  the  annals  of 
woman,  if  we  except  the  rise  and  decline  of  the  Em- 
press, [Josephine]  whose  destiny  was  the  dial  of  Na- 
poleon's fate. 

Mary  Stuart  was  born  December  8,  1542 — (ac- 
cord inp  to  Miss  Bender's  Memoirs.  I  Wcmber  7,) — at 
the  palace  of  Linlithgow,*  situated  on  the  shore  of  a 
lx&gt;iiutiful  lake  in  the  heart  of  Scotland.  Her  father, 
James  V.,  assumed  the  reins  of  government  when 
seventeen  years  old,  and  at  twenty-three,  married 
Magdalen,  daughter  of  Francis  I.  King  of  France. 
She  died  two  years  later,  and  the  King  married  Mary, 
eldest  daughter  of  Claude  de  Guise,  of  Lorraine,  and 
widow  of  Louis  of  Orleans — an  accomplished  and 
fascinating  woman.  There  was  a  sad  omen  in  the 
circumstances  attending  the  birth  of  Mary.  James, 
who  had  refused  to  meet  Henry  the  Eighth  of  Eng- 
land at  York,  to  form  a  religious  union,  was  caressed 
and  flattered  by  the  cardinal  and  bishops,  while  the 

*  The  palace  of  Linlithgow  is  beautifully  located  in  the 
town  of  the  same  name,  a  small  town  numbering  to-day  a  pop- 
ulation of  less  than  4,000.  It  is  about  eighteen  miles  directly 
west  of  Edinburgh,  and  a  short  distance  south  of  the  Firth  of 
Forth.  The  castle,  which  is  very  old,  is  supposed  to  have 
been  founded  by  Edward  I.,  that  is,  ^Edward,  King  of  the 
Saxons,  who  died  in  the  year  988.

increasing  spirit  of  faction  spread  among  his  nobles. 
When,  therefore,  his  army  came  to  battle  with  five 
hundred  English,  at  Solway  Moss,  they  immediately 
fled.  His  proud  and  passionate  heart  was  stung  with 
mortification,  and  weakly  yielding  to  the  calamity, 
he  died  a  few  days  after  hearing  the  tidings  of  Mary's 
birth.  Upon  the  factious  desertion  of  his  forces, 
"  the  King  passed  out  of  Holyrood  House  to  Falk- 
land, and  there  became  heavy  and  dolorous,  that  he 
never  ate  nor  drank  that  had  digestion ;  and  so  he 
became  vehement  sick  that  no  man  had  hope  of  his 
life :  then  he  sent  for  certain  of  his  lords,  both  spirit' 
ual  and  temporal,  to  have  their  counsel,  but  ere  they 
came,  he  was  well  nigh  strangled  to  death  by  ex- 
treme melancholy.  By  this  the  post  came  to  the 
King  out  of  Linlithgow,  showing  him  good  tidings 
that  the  Queen  was  delivered.  The  King  inquired 
whether  it  was  a  man-child  or  a  woman ;  the  messen- 
ger said,  ( It  is  a  fair  daughter ; '  the  King  answered, 
Adieu !  farewell :  it  came  with  a  lass,  and  it  will  pass 
with  a  lass;  and  so  he  recommended  himself  to  the 
mercy  of  Almighty  God,  and  spake  little  from  that 
time  forth,  but  turned  his  back  to  his  lords,  and  his 
face  to  the  wall.  At  this  time  Laird  Beaton,  Cardi- 
nal of  Scotland,  standing  in  presence  of  the  King, 
seeing  him  begin  to  fail  of  his  strength  and  natural 
speech,  held  a  throck  of  paper  to  his  grace,  and 
caused  him  to  subscribe  the  same,  wherein  the  said 
cardinal  wrote  what  pleased  him  for  his  own  partic- 
ular thinking,  to  have  authority  and  preeminence  in 
the  government  of  the  country.  But  we  may  know 
hereby  the  King's  legacy  was  very  short,  for  in  this 
manner  he  departed,  as  hereafter  I  shall  show  you.

He  tnnu-&lt;l  liini  upon  his  lock,  and  looked  and  looked 
and  behrM  ;ill  his  nobles  and  lord-  alxMit  him.  an-l 
gave  a  little  smile  of  laughter,  then  kissed  his  hnn«l, 
ami  offered  the-  same  t&lt;»  all  his  nobles  round  about 
him,  thereafter  held  up  his  hands,  and  yielded  hi* 
spirit  to  God." 

No  sooner  was  the  King  buried,  than  the  uncon- 
scious infant,  his  only  daughter,  became  the  object  of 
political  intrigue  and  hitter  jealousies.  The  Engli&gt;h 
monarch  dispatched  Sadler,  a  distinguished  negotia- 
tor, to  secure  the  marriage  of  his  son  Edward  to  the 
heiress  of  Scotland.  His  design  was  to  consolidate 
the  interests  of  the  two  kingdoms,  and  establish  abid- 
ing peace.  The  difficulties  to  be  overcome  were  man- 
ifold. The  nobility  were  divided.  A  large  party 
was  dependent  on  England,  another  sympathized  with 
France,  and  a  third,  the  smallest  faction,  was  com- 
posed of  genuine  patriots — high-minded  men,  ready 
to  defend  with  their  blood,  the  independence  and 
glory  of  their  ancient  realm.  The  clergy  were  of 
e&lt;iurse  hostile  to  the  Reformation,  and  actively  fanned 
the  flame  of  discord  In-tween  Knirland  ami  semi- 
catholic  Scotland.  Meanwhile,  the  Karl  of  Arran, 
through  the  ascendency  of  the  nobility,  was  appointed 
hy  Parliament  Regent  of  the  kingdom.  To  him  Sad- 
ler promised  the  alliance.  Cardinal  lieaton,  who  had 
aspired  to  the  regency,  employed  his  influence  over 
the  earl,  to  prevent  the  consummation  of  the  politic 
scheme,  and  obtain  a  similar  arrangement  with 
France,  a  papal  power.  Although  Arran  vacillated. 
Henry  the  VIII.  might  have  succeeded,  had  not  his 
fiery  and  impetuous  nature  urired  his  claims  too 
hemently.  He  demanded  the  guardianship  of  Mary

till  she  was  of  marriageable  'age,  and  also  asked  tlu&gt; 
surrender  of  several  of  the  most  impregnable  for- 
tresses in  Scotland.  This  exaction  roused  popular 
feeling,  and  Henry  was  compelled  to  contract  his 
royal  ambition  to  the  simple  requisition,  that  the  ju- 
venile Queen  be  sent  to  England  when  she*  had 
reached  her  tenth  year,  and  espouse  the  Prince  of 
Wales.  On  the  1st  of  July,  1543,  a  treaty  was  con- 
cluded between  the  Regent  and  King  Henry.  Dur- 
ing this  excitement,  spreading  over  two  monarchies, 
and  enlisting  the  diplomacy  of  lords  and  kings,  Mary 
Stuart  was  smiling  in  the  dreams  of  helpless  infancy 
at  Linlithgow.  The  loch  sparkled  beneath  the  castle 
windows — fountains  sent  up  their  showers  of  dia- 
monds— and  the  soothing  accents  of  Janet,  her  nurse, 
were  more  welcome  than  the  salutations  of  steel-clad 
barons  and  earls,  who  came  to  look  on  the  child,  and 
congratulate  the  widowed  mother.  It  Avas  well  that 
neither  parent  nor  offspring  saw  the  strange  contrasts 
and  fearful  hours  of  the  future.  Mary  was  about 
nine  months  old,  when  her  coronation  was  appointed, 
on  the  9th  of  September,  1543,  at  Stirling  Castle — 
less  than  a  score  of  miles  from  Linlithgow — where 
this  pageant  had  for  many  years  been  witnessed. 

The  day  Avas  one  of  uniA^ersal  and  thrilling  interest 
in  Scotland.  The  first  female  sovereign  on  the 
throne  of  Bruce,  Avas  to  be  invested  Avith  crown  and 
sceptre.  Two  rival  kingdoms  and  the  reformers  of 
Europe  Avere  concerned  in  the  significant  event.  To 
behold  the  magnificent  scene,  came  pilgrims  from 
highland  and  lowland,  and  from  adjacent  realms, 
winding  up  the  hill  sides  from  the  beautiful  vales, 
to  the  rocky  summit,  frowning  Avith  the  battlements

and  towers  of  Stirling  Castle.  In  the  glitter \i\&lt;j 
train  that  followed  the  infant  Mary,  the  Earl  of 
Arran  bore  the  crown — Lennox  held  the  scepter.  It 
is  a  singular  fact,  that  the  fathers  of  Darnley  ami

ical overthrow,  were  among  the  attendants  win. 
sisted  in  her  coronation.  Cardinal  Beaton  placed 
the  symbol  of  regal  power  upon  the  brow  of  the  laugh- 
ing babe,  around  whom  factions  sternly  faced  each 
other,  and  the  shouts  of  the  multitude  made  the  old 
fortress  rock  to  its  base.  The  only  bewildered  and 
unconscious  being  there,  was  the  heiress  to  scarcely 
less  than  a  crown  of  thorn*. 

When  the  imposing  ceremonies  had  passed,  and  the 
intrigues  of  aspiring  men  were  renewed,  the  Earl  of 
Arran  began  to  feel  the  force  of  a  long  cherished 
family  preference  for  French  alliances,  and  the  artful 
appeals  of  Cardinal  Beaton.  Renouncing  his  Prot- 
estant tendencies,  he  joined  the  Catholic  party,  of 
which  the  Queen  Dowager,*  distinguished  for  her 
dissimulation  and  diplomacy,  was  the  head.  The 
covenant  with  England  was  therefore  annulled,  and 
on  the  15th  of  December,  less  than  six  months  after 
tho  treaty  with  Henry  was  formed,  an  alliance  with 
France  was  signed  at  Edinburgh,  by  the  Regent  and 
l\-tate&lt;  of  Scotland,  who  at  the  same  time  ratified,  in 
Mary'-  name,  all  the  treaties  which  had  been  made 
between  the  realms,  since  the  reign  of  Robert  Bruce. 

This  wa&lt;  the  signal  of  war,  which  was  declared 
by  the  enraged  monarch  of  England,  and  a  fleet 
was  dispatched  to  the  Firth  of  Forth.  This  arma- 
ment left  black  desolation  in  its  path  along  the  coast,

and  at  length  threatened  with  the  torch  of  conflagra- 
tion the  noble  city  of  Edinburgh.  Upon  the  south- 
ern frontier  hung  the  English  army,  ravaging  the 
Scottish  plains  with  frequent  and  lawless  incursions. 
It  was  the  folly  of  a  prince,  haughtily  impatient  of 
restraint,  to  anticipate  success  by  urging  young  Ed- 
ward's right  to  Mary's  hand,  upon  the  resolute 
Scotch,  with  the  ruthless  enterprise  of  a  freebooter. 
The  inevitable  result  Avas,  a  deepening  hatred  of  the 
English,  and  more  determined  resistance.  From 
France,  auxiliary  troops  were  called,  to  prosecute 
vigorously  the  war.  The  whole  country  was  in  a 
state  of  alarm.  Persecution  went  abroad,  with  un- 
relenting cruelty.  The  castle  of  St.  Andrews  and 
the  French  galleys  received  the  leaders  of  the  English 
Reformation  in  Scotland.  The  virtuous  and  gifted 
Wishart  went  to  the  stake  under  the  religious  despot- 
ism of  Cardinal  Beaton ;  and  bloody  deeds  were  every- 
where common.  The  death  of  Henry  VIII.  in  Jan- 
uary, 1547,  left  his  experiment  of  uniting  the  houses 
of  the  Stuarts  and  the  Tudors,  a  total  failure,  and 
the  kingdoms  of  Scotland  and  England  wider  asunder 
than  at  any  previous  period. 

The  Duke  of  Somerset,  uncle  of  Edward  VI.,  was 
appointed  Protector  of  the  kingdom,  during  the  mi- 
nority of  the  Prince,  and  carried  forward  energeti- 
cally the  plans  of  the  late  King.  With  an  army  of 
eighteen  thousand  men,  he  appeared  on  Scottish  soil, 
and  offered  to  retire,  only  on  conditions  that  Mary 
should  remain  in  her  native  land  till  old  enough  to 
marry,  and  that  all  negotiations  with  France  cease 
forever.  But  the  spirit  of  national  independence, 
which  spurned  the  humiliation  of  concession,  lived

among  the  highlands,  and  in  the  palaces  of  the  di- 
vided nobility.  The  Earl  of  Arran  gathered  a  force 
of  more  than  thirty  thousand  soldiers,  and  march.  .1 
to  the  banks  of  the  Esk,  four  miles  from  Edinburgh, 
where  Somerset  had  taken  his  position.  The  Pro- 
tector then  renewed  his  proposals  to  evacuate  the 
realm,  and  also  repair  damages  which  he  had  com- 
mitted, upon  the  same  terms  as  before.  The  Scotch, 
confident  of  victory,  refused,  and  after  some  man- 
ceuvering,  the  battle  opened.  The  strife  was  fierce; 
and  when  the  clashing  of  spears  had  died  away,  and 
the  tempest  of  arrows  ceased,  there  lay  ten  thousand 
of  Arran's  host  on  the  field,  and  the  remainder  wore 
flying  hotly  before  the  shouting  enemy,  whose  loss 
was  scarcely  two  hundred  men.  This  decisive  con- 
test was  called  the  battle  of  Pinkie,  from  the  seat  of  a 
nobleman  near  the  scene  of  bloody  encounter.  The 
English,  advancing  to  Leith,  finally  entrenched 
themselves  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country,  and  re- 
ceived the  surrender  of  the  lairds  along  that  frontier. 
Somerset,  alarmed  by  cabals  against  him  at  home. 
hastened  to  London;  and  Scotland,  improving  the  de- 
lay, turned  anxiously  to  France,  tendering  that  power 
the  guardianship  and  inheritance  of  Mary  Stuart. 
The  Princess  had  passed  the  period  of  these  exciting 
events  at  Stirling  Castle,  under  the  care  of  her  gov- 
ernors, Lords  Erskine  and  Livingston,  a  lovely, 
laughing  girl,  not  six  years  of  age,  when  the  tidings 
of  defeat  at  Pinkie  reached  the  royal  fortress. 

Stirling  was  now    in   danger  of  assault,   and   it 

was  determined  to  remove  Mary  to  the  island  of  Inch- 

mahome,   in  the  lake  of  Monteith.*     There  was  a 

•Mr.  Abbott  puts  Mary's  removal  to  Inchmahome  about

monastery  there,  sheltered  by  its  isolation  from  the 
foraging  troops  of  the  English  army.  It  was  a  ro- 
mantic retreat,  devoted  to  religious  purposes  mainly, 
and  like  Calypso's  island  *  to  the  young  captive  of 
Stirling  Castle.  In  addition  to  the  curators  of  her 
person,  she  was  attended  by  Erskine,  the  prior  of 
Inchmahome,  the  parson  of  Balmaclellan,  the  nurse, 
Janet  Sinclair,  her  governess,  Lady  Fleming,  daugh- 
ter of  James  Fourth,  and  over  all,  Mary  of  Guise, 
whose  clear  intellect  was  stimulated  to  activity  and 
vigilance  by  maternal  affection.  To  increase  the 
pleasures  of  an  only  daughter,  and  give  completeness 
to  her  culture,  she  formed  a  social  group,  or  school, 
of  four  girls,  about  the  same  age,  and  bearing  the 
name  of  the  Queen.  The  first  was  Mary  Beaton, 
niece  of  the  cardinal;  the  second,  Mary  Fleming, 
daughter  of  Lord  Fleming;  the  third,  Mary  Living- 
ston, and  the  fourth,  Mary  Seton. 

Little  is  known  of  Mary  Stuart's  history  in  Inch- 
mahome. She  had  begun  an  acquaintance  with  the 
French  language,  and,  it  is  said,  with  the  classics. 
Doubtless,  excepting  the  occasional  recitations,  mat- 
ins and  vespers,  these  children,  six  years  of  age, 
passed  their  time  as  others  do,  amid  the  pleasant 
scenes  of  quiet  life,  in  juvenile  pastimes,  and  rambles 
over  the  green  esplanade  of  their  consecrated  home. 
In  a  few  months  the  Marys  were  removed  from  this 
tranquil  and  delightful  refuge  to  Dumbarton  Cas- 
tle; where  bold  and  romantic  scenery  has  furnished 

three  years  earlier,  which  does  not  agree  with  Mignet  and 
others.

which  eontampltted  the  interference  of  the  Duk- 
Somerset  to  prevent  the  cscajH-  &lt;.f  Mary  t.. 
was,  on  that  account,  of  short  continuance.  Admiral 
ViUegognon,  with  four  galleys,  was  in  the  Civile, 
to  convey  the  Queen  and  her  retinue  to  the  dominion- 
of  Henry  II.,  who  had  succeeded  Francis  I.  The 
fleet  sailed  from  harbor  the  7th  of  August.  The 
parting  with  her  mother  was  affecting;  but  it  is  af- 
firmed by  biographen,  that  no  murmurs  escaped  the 
young  exile's  lips.  She  wept  with  a  multitude  of  her 
people,  as  the  royal  vessel  floated  away,  and  her  na- 
tive land  Ix'gan  to  recede  from  her  radiant  « 
Scarcely  had  the  fleet  passed  out  into  the  deep,  before 
the  English  squadron  arrived  at  St.  Abbs'  Head,  to 
oppose  its  departure  from  the  coast  of  Scotland. 
After  a  pleasant  voyage,  the  flying  Mary,  with  her 
company,  arrived  at  Brest,  August  13th,  1."&gt;4S  She 
was  received  with  great  pomp  by  the  King  of  France, 
and  the  procession  moved  on  to  Paris  amid  the  regal 
splendor  of  that  extravagant  period  of  French  his- 
tory. Prison  doors  were  thrown  open  at  the  ap- 
proach of  the  cavalcade,  and  the  captives  restored  to 
freedom.  It  was  a  straniyly  exciting  scene  to  the 
laughing  girl  who  was  the  cause  of  it  all. 

After  a  brief  residence  in  the  palace  of  St.  Ger- 
main, surrounded  with  courtly  pageantry,  Mary  was 
removed  to  a  convent,  to  complete  her  education. 
She  was  subjected  to  strict  rules  of  discipline,  and 
n-irularly  accn.-tomed  to  join  the  nuns  in  their  devo- 
tional exercises,  and  ascetic  humiliations:  and  so 
readily  did  -he  comply  with  whatever  was  required 
by  her  spiritual  directors,  that  they  began  to  cherish 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  23 

ambitious  hopes  of  their  royal  pupil,  and  to  boast 
that  she  had  a  religious  vocation.  This  persuasion 
was  too  agreeable  to  self-love  and  to  enthusiasm,  to 
be  confined  to  their  own  community;  the  nuns  offi- 
ciously proclaimed  their  conviction  that  the  little 
Mary  Stuart  would  be  a  saint  on  earth:  and  with 
such  zeal  was  the  rumor  propagated,  that  it  even 
reached  the  King,  who  had  just  returned  from  Bou- 
logne, and  who,  not  relishing  the  suggestion,  imme- 
diately demanded  that  his  daughter-in-law  elect 
should  be  transferred  to  apartments  in  the  palace, 
Avhere  she  could  no  longer  be  accessible  to  sainted 
maids,  or  exposed  to  their  pious  seductions.  Accord- 
ing to  her  learned  biographer,*  the  execution  of  this 
mandate  drew  from  Mary  more  tears  than  she  had 
shed  on  leaving  Scotland.  Whether  the  endearingman- 
ners  of  the  community  had  so  strongly  engaged  her  af- 
fections, or  that,  in  the  tranquillity  of  her  retreat,  so 
congenial  to  the  simple  wishes  of  childhood,  the  sen- 
sibilities of  her  nature  had  prematurely  expanded, 
we  are  assured  not  only  that  she  evinced  deep  sorrow 
at  this  change  of  residence,  but  that  she  eagerly  em- 
braced every  permission  that  was  offered,  of  revisit- 
ing the  sisters  of  the  community,  and  long  after  em- 
ployed her  needle  in  embroidering  an  altar-piece  for 
the  church  of  their  con  vent,  f  In  the  palace,  as  be- 
fore, Mary  was  attended  by  her  two  scholastic  precep- 
tors, her  governess,  the  Lady  Fleming,  and  her  cura- 
tor, Reid,  Bishop  of  Orkney,  who  had  succeeded  Lord 
Livingston  in  that  important  trust.  Her  Marys  con- 
tinued to  be  her  constant  companions ;  and  as  she  dis-

covered  uncommon  aptitude  to  application,  nothing 
\va.-  omitted  to  &gt;timulatc  her  exertions  or  iwr&lt;  a-e  her 
diligence.      Exclusive  of  the  Latin  and  French. 
began  also  to  study  the  Italian  language:  hut  mu-i«- 
was  rarely  cultivated  by  the  great  as  a  -  :ind 

it  was  not  till  a  later  period  that  she  learnt  to  play 
on  the  virginals  and  clavichords.* 

The  education  «»f  Mary  was  precisely  such  as  was 
given  to  the  daughters  of  France,  with  certain  sup- 
plementary literary  advantages,  for  which  &gt;he  ap- 
pears to  have  been  exclusively  indebted  to  the  super- 
intendence of  her  uncle,  Cardinal  Tx)rraine.  ''  In  the 
education  of  a  royal  personage,  mental  cultivation, 
however  highly  valued,  was  of  subordinate  impor- 
tance to  the  acquisition  of  those  external  accomplish- 
ments, necessary  to  that  public  exhibition  which  is 
unavoidably  imposed  on  the  station  of  a  sovereign. 
For  those  who  live  exposed  to  the  public  gaze,  alter- 
nately the  objects  of  criticism  and  admiration,  to  be 
wanting  in  a  dignified  carriage,  or  gracious  de- 
meanor; to  be  untasteful  in  dress,  of  ungraceful 
&gt;|teeeh,  or  shy,  repul-ive  manners,  has  ever  been  an 
irreparable  defect,  for  which  neither  moral  nor  intel- 
lectual qualities  could  compensate  to  their  possessor. 
To  guaranty  the  royal  pupils  from  this  misfortune, 
appears  to  have  been  a  primary  object  with  the 

nch  teacher:  and  whilst  the  prince  was  taught  to 
ride,  to  fence,  and  to  jx-rfonii  all  the  athletic  exer- 

I  suited  t&lt;&gt;  his  sex  and  rank,  he  was  at  the  same 
time  habituated  to  speak  in  public,  to  recite  dis- 
courses, which  he,  perhaps,  scarcely  understood,  and 

*  Both  these  instruments,  of  crude  and  primitive  construc- 
tion, were  predecessors  of  the  piano. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  25 

to  address,  in  a  tone  of  confidence  and  friendship, 
those  to  whose  persons  and  character  he  was  almost  a 
stranger." 

The  influences  which  were  to  attend  Mary  appear 
in  a  brief  and  vivid  description  of  royalty.  This 
court  was  then  the  most  magnificent,  the  most  elegant, 
the  most  joyous,  and,  we  must  add,  the  most  lax  in 
Europe.  Still  retaining  certain  military  customs  of 
the  middle  ages,  and  at  the  same  time  conforming  to 
the  intellectual  usages  of  the  time  of  the  renaissance, 
it  was  half-chivalric  and  half-literary,  mingling  tour- 
naments with  studies,  hunting  with  erudition,  mental 
achievements  with  bodily  exercises,  the  ancient  and 
rough  games  of  skill  and  strength  with  the  novel  and 
delicate  pleasures  of  the  arts.  Nothing  could  equal 
the  splendor  and  vivacity  which  Francis  I.  had  intro- 
troduced  into  his  court,  by  attracting  thither  all  the 
principal  nobility  of  France,  by  educating  as  pages 
therein  young  gentlemen  of  all  the  provinces,  by 
adorning  it  with  nearly  two  hundred  ladies  belonging 
to  the  greatest  families  in  the  kingdom,  and  by  estab- 
lishing it  sometimes  in  the  splendid  palaces  of  Fon- 
tainebleau  and  St.  Germain,  which  he  had  either  built 
or  beautified,  on  the  banks  of  the  Seine,  and  some- 
times in  the  spacious  castles  of  Blois  and  Amboise, 
which  his  predecessors  had  inhabited,  on  the  banks  of 
the  Loire.  A  careful  imitator  of  his  father's  example, 
Henry  II.  kept  up  the  same  magnificence  at  his  court, 
which  was  presided  over  with  as  much  grace  as  ac- 
tivity by  the  subtle  Italian,  Catherine  de  Medici, 
whose  character  had  been  formed  by  Francis  L,  who 
had  admitted  her  into  the  little  circle  of  his  favorite 
ladies,  with  whom  he  used  to  hunt  the  stag,  and  fre-

quently  sport  in  his  plea-ur&lt; -limi-«-  !  The  men  v 
constantly  in  the  company  «.f  tin-  women:  tin  On--,  n 
and  her  ladies  were  present  at  all  tin-  games  and 
amusements  of  Henry  II.  and  his  gentlemen,  and  ac- 
companied them  in  the  cha-c.  Tin  King,  on  his 
part,  together  with  the  noblemen  of  his  retinue,  used 
to  pass  several  hours  every  morning  aiul  evening  in 
the  apartments  of  Catherine  dc  Medici.  "  There." 
says  Brantome,  ''there  was  a  host  of  human  p&lt;"| 
desses,  some  more  beautiful  than  others;  every  lord 
and  gentleman  conversed  with  her  he  loved  1&lt; 
whilst  the  King  talked  to  the  Queen,  his  si.-ter,  the 
danphiness,  (Mary  Stuart,)  and  the  princesses,  to- 
gether with  those  lords  and  prinees  who  were  seated 
nearest  him."  As  the  kinirs  themselves  had  avowed 
mistresses,  they  were  desirous  that  their  subjects 
should  follow  their  example,  "  and  if  they  did  not  do 
so,"  says  Brantome,  "  they  considered  them  cox- 
combs and  fools." 

Mary's  education  had,  therefore,  all  the  elaborate 
culture  and  glaring  faults  incident  to  royal  munifi- 
cence, Romish  instructors,  and  a  corrupt  court. 
Pride  of  lineage,  and  self-respect  that  would  repel  a 
stain  upon  hereditary  honors,  sooner  than  an  assault 
upon  personal  virtue,  were  conspicuous  in  the  splen- 
did reign  of  Henry  the  Second.  There  was  pagean- 
try reflecting  the  ancestral  glory  of  past  ages,  and  a 
polished  surface-dressing  of  society,  which  concealed 
a  melancholy  want  of  religious  tone  and  purity.  In- 
stead of  the  power  of  Puritan  faith,  the  young  Qu 
embraced  ardently  the  dogmas  of  persecuting  Rome. 
These  early  influences  upon  her  character  were  after-

wards  developed  in  acts  which  partially  eclipsed  her 
amiable  qualities  and  brilliant  genius. 

When  Mary  was  nearly  eight  years  old,  her  mother, 
Queen  Dowager  of  Scotland,  reached  Rouen.  The 
arrangements  for  this  anticipated  visit  were  expen- 
sive and  imposing.  After  the  dazzling  reception 
given  by  the  King  and  his  attendants,  Mary  of  Quise 
was  conducted  to  the  apartments  of  Mary  Stuart. 
The  sight  of  the  beautiful  girl,  whose  deportment  had 
the  refined  dignity  of  queenly  womanhood,  was  like  a 
rapturous  vision  to  the  ambitious  mother.  Tears  of 
joy  fell  fast,  and  smiles  of  maternal  affection  played 
brightly  round  her  tremulous  lips.  But  the  Princess 
stood  in  the  conscious  greatness  of  her  destiny,  and 
with  the  subsiding  ecstasy  of  her  mother,  quietly  de- 
manded, "  whether  any  feuds  continued  to  subsist  in 
the  noble  families  of  Scotland ;  at  the  same  time  in- 
quiring by  name  for  those  who  had  evinced  most  at- 
tachment to  the  ancient  faith."  She  then  proceeded 
to  ask,  with  all  the  usual  expressions  of  royal  benev- 
olence, "  if  the  English  still  harassed  her  dear  native 
country ;  whether  divine  worship  had  been  preserved 
in  uncontaminated  purity;  whether  the  prelates  and 
priests  attended  to  their  respective  duties,  expressing 
detestation  for  all  who  had  forsaken  the  faith  of  their 
fathers."  This  premature  display  of  powers,  be- 
trayed both  her  docility  toward  her  teachers, 'and  the 
artificial  training  of  the  palace  and  the  times.  For 
two  days,  festal  scenes  were  witnessed  in  the  ancient 
town  of  Rouen. 

"  The  only  classical  part  of  the  show  was  a  trium- 
phal arch,  under  which  passed  a  procession,  at  once 
superb  and  grotesque.  The  first  object  was  a  chariot,

drawn  by  :i  unicorn,  a  ft  or  which  came  two  elephant--, 
or  rather  IHM-H-S  so  di&gt;gui.-cd  us  to  represent  them, 
l»earing  &lt;»i  their  hacks  two  litters,  in  which  were 
seated  ladies,  df  whom  a  tran&gt;ient  glimpse  was  taken 
from  tin-  latticcol  aj&gt;ertures.  Religion  followed  in 
lu-r  triumphal  car,  l»earing  in  her  arms  the  appro- 
priate- symlxd  of  a  church.  Next  to  these  walked  a 
man,  carrying  the  image  of  the  Virgin  and  the  child 
,Ie.-ns.  Then  followed  the  car  &lt;&gt;f  Fortune,  in  which 
rode  another  man,  young  and  handsome,  as  the  repre- 
sentative- of  Henry  the  Second,  behind  whom  stalked 
a  boy,  to  personate  the  Dauphin.  To  crown  the 
whole,  Neptune  glided  along  with  Amphitrite,  at- 
tended by  tritons  and  sea  monsters." 

This  display  was  followed  by  a  public  entry  into 
Paris.  For  a  year,  Mary  enjoyed  the  society  of  her 
mother,  surrounded  with  scenes  of  festivity  and  all 
the  pleasures  of  a  court,  of  which  she  was  the  favor- 
ite. It  is  not  strange  that  her  early  love  grew  strong 
for  France,  and  that  in  after  life  she  turned  to  mem- 
ory'- record  of  those  departed  joy&gt;.  with  tears.  But 
the  Queen  Dowager  had  more  ambitious  aims  to  se- 
eure  Itefore  leaving  the  palace  of  Henry,  than  the  so- 
ciety of  her  daughter  and  the  brilliant  -uccession  of 
entertainments  which  she  enjoyed.  Her  aspiring 
heart  had  been  long  fixed  on  attaining  the  regency  of 
Scotland,  which  now  she  saw  within  her  grasp.  It 
was  only  necessary  to  obtain  the  assent  of  the  King  to 
the  conditions,  u|N.n  which  the  Karl  of  Arran  might 
be  induced  to  resign  his  office  in  her  behalf.  With 
this  pledge,  she  prepared  to  leave  her  native  land.

cherished  mourning  for  the  dead,  and  self-inflicted 
mortifications,  heightened  by  the  sympathy  she  ex- 
torted from  all  around  her.  To  this  mother,  sitting 
in  the  shadow  of  death,  a  weeping  monument  of  in- 
exorable despair,  Mary  of  Guise,  with  filial  respect, 
made  a  toilsome  journey.  Entering  the  ample  apart- 
ments of  the  maternal  mansion,  which  were  hung  in 
black,  she  communed  for  the  last  time  with  a  spirit, 
beneath  whose  surface,  calm  with  habitual  grief, 
burned  intensely  a  persecuting  intolerance  towards 
heretics.  From  the  tomb  of  the  living  she  hastened 
again  to  Fontainebleau,  to  bid  adieu  to  Mary  Stuart ; 
and  breaking  away  from  the  ties  of  family  and  coun- 
try embarked  for  England,  to  consummate  her  am- 
bitious plans. 

The  parting  look  was  her  last  upon  Mary ;  they  met 
no  more  this  side  the  vale  of  eternal  scenes.  The  ed- 
ucation of  the  young  Princess  was  continued  with 
dazzling  progress.  Living  in  the  atmosphere  of  liter- 
ature, where  the  King's  daughters  were  linguists,  and 
the  arts  a  theme  of  constant  criticism,  her  genius  out- 
shone the  more  mature,  lending  its  fascination  to  her 
unrivaled  beauty  of  person.  At  ten  years  of  age,  she 
wrote  the  following  letter  to  the  Queen  Dowager,  con- 
cerning the  affairs  of  Scotland,  with  a  practical  sense 
and  precision  which  astonished  even  her  admirers,  as 
an  exhibition  of  precocious  talents  and  culture,  both 
in  science  and  belles-lettres,  and  in  the  policy  of  ambi- 
tious sovereigns :  *

have  been  pleased  to  write  me  by  Aztus  Asquin,  by 
which  I  have  learnt  the  pleasure  you  have  felt  that  I 
have  kept  secret  the  things  which  it  pleased  you  to 
send  to  me.  I  can  assure  you,  madame,  that  nothing 
that  comes  from  you  shall  be  known  by  me  (ne  sera 

seen  par  inoy) I  humbly  lx&gt;g  you  to  be- 

lieve  that  I  shall  not  fail  to  obey  you  in  everything  in 
which  you  are  pleased  to  command  me,  and  to  think 
that  the  chief  \vi-h  I  have  in  the  world  is  to  be  obe- 
dient and  agreeable  to  you,  doing  you  every  possible 
service,  as  I  am  bound.  I  have  seen,  by  your  left 
that  yon  beg  me  to  approve  the  marriage-gift  of  the 
late  M.  A-fpiiu  to  his  son,  who  is  here.  I  humbly  en- 
treat you  never  to  give  me  anything  but  your  com- 
mands, as  to  your  very  humble  and  very  obedient 
daughter  and  servant,  for  otherwise  I  shall  not  think 
I  have  the  happiness  of  being  in  your  good  graces. 
As  for  my  master,  I  will  do  as  you  have  told  me.  I 
have  shown  the  letters  you  have  been  pleased  to  write 
to  me  to  my  uncle.  Monsieur  de  Guise,  thinking  that 
you  would  wish  it,  though,  after  the  directions  you 
have  given  me,  1  should  not  have  shown  them  but  that 
I  was  afraid  I  could  not  arrange  things  without  his 
help.  I  write  two  other  letters  with  my  own  hand; 
the  one  concerning  Mde.  de  Parroys,  and  the  other 
for  my  master,  that  you  may  IM&gt;  aide  to  show  that  of 
my  said  master  without  this,  so  that  they  may  not 
think  that  you  have  told  me  anything  al»out  it.  .  . 
I  should  have  written  to  you  in  eipher,  but  my 
secretary  has  told  me  that  it  was  not  necessary,  and 
that  he  was  writing  to  yon  in  cipher.  I  write  also  to 
my  natural  brother,  (frerc  fatUurd,)  according  to  the 
advice  of  my  uncle,  M.  de  Guise.  The  said  letters 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  31 

are  open,  in  order  that  you  may  deliver  them  if  you 
approve  of  them." 

Music,  poetry,  drawing,  the  exciting  pleasures  of 
the  chase,  aquatic  excursions,  and  social  scenes,  were 
crowded  into  the  premature  experience  of  Mary.  On 
one  occasion,  riding  at  full  speed  in  pursuit  of  a 
stag,  attended  by  a  party  of  the  nobility,  her  dress 
caught  in  the  boughs  of  a  tree,  and  in  a  moment  she 
was  unhorsed,  and  lying  upon  the  turf.  The  com- 
pany passed  on  without  seeing  her.  Her  coolness 
was  admirable;  she  made  no  outcry,  and  when  her 
steed  was  brought  back,  she  arranged  her  disheveled 
hair,  and  remounting,  again  dashed  forward  in  the 
chase. 

The  following  letter,  written  about  this  time,  when 
Mary  was  twelve  years  old,  and  addressed  to  her 
mother,  gives  a  glimpse  of  the  careful  guardianship 
with  which  she  was  environed,  and  of  her  filial  tem- 
per: 

"  MADAME — I  have  been  well  pleased  to  find  so 
good  an  opportunity  to  write  you,  as  I  still  remain 
here  in  this  place  of  Mendon,  with  my  grandmother, 
where  the  King  and  the  Queen  are  to  come  Thursday 
next,  to  the  baptism  of  my  little  cousin.  My  uncle, 
the  cardinal,  has  informed  me  that  all  the  lords  of  my 
kingdom  are  well  disposed  to  obey  you,  and  to  do  for 
you,  as  well  as  for  myself,  whatever  you  may  please 
to  command  them,  for  which  I  am  very  grateful,  and 
well  pleased,  desiring  very  much  to  hear  your  news, 
and  awaiting  which,  I  present  my  very  humble  com- 
pliments to  your  good  grace — praying  God  to  give

you,  madamc,  happiness  and  long  life,  I  am  your  very 
hmiilile  ami  very  &lt;&gt;l&gt;e&lt;lient  daughter  Mary.  Madame, 
once  more  I  thank  you." 

A  \ear  later  she  composed  a  Latin  speech,  and  re- 
cited it  in  the  presence  of  the  King,  the  Queen,  and 
I  he  entire  court,  assembled  in  the  hall  of  the  Louvre. 
The  Cardinal  of  Lorraine  wrote  to  her  mother  in  the 
following  strain  of  eulogy: 

"  Your  daughter  has  so  increased,  and  indeed  in- 
creases daily  in  height,  goodness,  beauty,  wisdom,  and 
virtues,  that  she  is  as  perfect  and  accomplished  in  all 
things  honest  and  virtuous  as  it  is  possible  for  her  to 
be;  and  there  is  no  one  like  her  to  be  found  in  this 
kingdom,  either  among  noble  ladies  or  others,  of 
whatever  low  or  mean  condition  and  quality  they  may 
be:  and  I  am  constrained  to  tell  you,  madame,  that 
the  King  takes  such  a  liking  to  her,  that  he  often 
passes  his  time  in  chatting  with  her  for  the  space  of 
an  hour;  and  she  knows  quite  well  how  to  entertain 
him  with  good  and  wise  conversation,  as  if  she  were 
a  woman  twenty-five  years  of  age." 

The  homage  paid  to  Mary's  beauty  and  graceful 
mien  was  universal. 

Upon  a  grand  religious  occasion,  when  a  magnifi- 
cent procession  moved  at  evening,  each  lady  bearing 
aloft  in  her  right  hand  a  lighted  torch,  and  in  her 
left  waving  a  palm  of  victory,  it  is  recorded  that  a 
woman,  with  superstitious  \vniidor,  approached  Mary, 
while  her  beaming  face  reflected  the  brightness  of  her 
beacon,  and  exclaimed,  "  Are  you  not  indeed  an  an- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  33 

gel  ?  "  Mary  also  excelled  in  the  art  cf  embroidery, 
then  a  popular  and  essential  part  of  female  educa- 
tion, and  which  she  cultivated,  together  with  the  in- 
vention of  heraldic  and  other  devices,  under  the  eye 
of  the  dignified,  refined  and  imperious  Catherine, 
the  Queen  of  France.  It  is  related  by  Conscus,  that 
while  Mary  Stuart  was  passing  the  limited  hours, 
with  the  King's  daughters,  in  the  royal  apartment, 
she  :{  had  neither  eye  nor  ear  but  for  her  elect  step- 
mother; she  eagerly  treasured  every  word  that  fell 
from  her  lips,  watched  her  looks,  imitated  her  mo- 
tions, and  evidently  was  anxious  to  form  herself  upon 
the  accomplished  model  before  her."  The  same 
writer  adds,  that  when  Catherine  inquired  of  the 
princess,  why  she  preferred  her  society  to  the  com- 
panionship of  youthful  persons,  the  womanly  maiden 
replied,  "  that  with  them  she  might,  indeed,  enjoy 
much,  but  could  learn  nothing;  whilst  in  her  Majes- 
ty's wisdom  and  affability  she  found  an  example  and 
a  guide  for  her  future  life."  Catherine  smiled  at  the 
reply,  as  an  idle  compliment.  She  naturally  felt  her 
maternal  pride  wounded  by  the  transcendent  attrac- 
tions of  her  protegee  in  contrast  with  her  own  daugh- 
ters, and  fearing  future  rivalry  in  the  claim  to  royal 
honors,  soon  betrayed  a  secret  enmity  towards  the  un- 
offending Mary. 

Contemplating  the  extraordinary  endowments  of 
the  fair  exile,  with  her  subsequent  history  before  the 
mind,  who  can  suppress  a  rising  sadness  in  view  of 
the  beauteous  victim,  having  all  of  life  that  was  joy- 
ous, and  kept  like  a  pagan  offering  in  the  temple  of 
sacrifice,  caressed  and  crowned  with  garlands,  for  the 
altar. 


34  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

And  it  cammi  In-  denied  that  Mary  Stuart's  Inurl 
and  coH.scirnrc  \\en-  cont iniially  in  danger;  if  neither 
urn-  stained  by  her  friendships  and  contacts  with  the 
accompli&gt;hed  and  unprincipled  nobility,  she  were  a 
iter  marvel  than  the  Ilehrew  amid  the  convivial 
population  of  the  cities,  from  which  ho  fled  to  escape 
the  retributive  storm.  Her  guardian  uncle,  Car- 
dinal of  Lorraine,  stamped  upon  her  religious  charac- 
ter his  own  hostility  to  John  Knox  and  the  spirit  of 
reform,  which  must  have  modified  those  sensibilities 
that  are  refined  by  a  pure  Christianity.  Thus,  at  the 
age  of  fifteen,  the  fairest  princess  of  Europe  is  a 
fascinating,  flattered,  and  educated  maiden;  virtuous, 
but  her  gentle  spirit  expanding  in  a  tainted  air;  con- 
scientious in  religions  duties,  but  according  to  the 
unsoftened  dogmas  of  an  ancient  and  persecuting 
faith.  Realms  and  their  sovereigns  are  deeply  in- 
terested in  the  destiny  of  the  exiled  daughter  of  the 
House  of  Stuart — a  destiny  which  at  this  early  age 
reached  an  exciting  and  decisive  turn,  in  its  gay  and 
onward  march  to  the  abvss  of  human  woe. 


CHAPTEK  II. 

FRANCIS,  son  of  Henry  II.  and  Catherine  de  Med- 
ici, was  born  at  Fontainebleau,  January  19,  1544; 
and  was,  therefore,  about  a  year  younger  than  Mary 
Stuart,  by  whom,  from  early  childhood,  he  had  been 
regarded  as  her  future  husband.  This  was  the  ar- 
rangement of  royal  policy ;  and  the  youthful  heirs  to 
sovereignty  had,  during  the  pastimes  of  childhood 
within  the  same  palace,  forwed  a  mutual  affection. 
The  Dauphin  *  was  constitutionally  and  mentally 
weak,  yet  amiable,  and  when  aroused,  energetic.  His 
personal  appearance  was  plain,  and  his  disposition  ex- 
tremely retiring.  Shrinking  with  timid  sensibility 
from  responsibilities,  he  was  neither  formed  to  com- 
mand, nor  win  the  popular  homage.  Although  Mary 
was  in  all  respects  his  superior,  eclipsing  by  the 
splendor  of  her  talents,  his  ordinary  endowments, 
and  fond  of  learning  as  he  was  of  intellectual  indo- 
lence, she  evidently  loved  him  for  his  virtuous  habits 
and  enthusiastic  devotion  to  her,  whose  smile  and 
pleasant  words  would  always  kindle  into  animation, 
the  habitual  repose  of  his  yet  juvenile  features.  But 
had  she  even  felt  a  repugnance  to  the  alliance,  so 

*  So  called  from  the  ancient  province  of  Dauphiny,  a  prince 
of  which,  upon  the  loss  of  his  only  son,  bequeathed  his  large 
estates  to  the  King,  on  condition  that  the  eldest  son  of  the 
reigning  monarch  of  France  should  thereafter  bear  the  title 
of  Dauphin.

completely  wa.-  &gt;hc  under  the  influence  of  her  uncles, 
I  hike  of  Guise,  who  was  at  the  he;nl  of  military  af- 
f:iirs,  and  Cardinal  of  Lorraine,  who  controlled  the 
clergy  :&lt;n&lt;l  finances,  that  her  real  sentiments  would 
not  have  been  revealed  liy  lips  which  were  carefully 
trained  to  the  concealment  of  kingly  designs  and  rao- 

Whatever  the  depth  of  Mary's  love,  the  mr 
were  appointed  to  lw  celebrated  on  Sunday,  April 
•Jlth,  ir.r.s.  Catherine  opposed  the  marriage  as  pre- 
mature, while  the  secret  reason  was  the  glory  of  the 
princess,  in  conflict  with  the  hopes  of  her  own 
pi  ring  family.  The  Protestants  of  Scotland,  al-o, 
de-ired  to  defeat  a  union  which  threatened  the  dawn- 
ing reformation  with  powerful  restraint,  if  not  tem- 
porary overthrow.  So  hitter  was  the  animosity,  that, 
according  to  historical  anecdote,  Stewart,  an  archer 
in  King  Henry's  guard,  attempted  to  poison  Mary, 
but  was  detected  and  beheaded.  There  were  other 
factions  at  home  ;nid  abroad,  hostile  to  the  approach- 
ing marriage.  All  these  sources  of  solicitude  stimu- 
lated Henry  to  consummate  the  favorite  purpose  of 
his  heart. 

In  the  meantime,  on  the  31st  of  October,  1557, 
Ilrnry  wrote  to  the  parliament  of  ScoHand..  inviting 
them  to  -end  a  deputation  to  Paris,  and  sanction  the 
marriage  in  the  name  of  their  kingdom,  and  attend 
the  ceremonies  uf  the  wedding  ml»er  1  Ith, 

Parliament  met,  and,  assured  by  the  regent's  plaus- 
ible representation,  appointed  nine  connnU-ioner- 
fulfill  the  royal  request.     These  were.  Archbishop  of 
(Ib-^ow;  the  P&gt;i.-hops  of  Ko-s  and  Orkney;  the  Karls 
of  Rothes   and   Cassillis;   and  Lords.   James   Stuart. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  37 

'James  Fleming,  George  Seaton  and  John  Erskine  of 
Dun.  They  were  instructed  to  secure  as  an  indis- 
pensable condition  of  approval,  from  both  the  Queen 
and  the  Dauphin,  "  a  promise  to  preserve  the  integ- 
rity of  the  kingdom,  and  observe  its  ancient  laws  and 
liberties." 

We  now  have  to  record  a  treacherous  act,  matured 
and  completed  by  a  corrupt  court,  but  in  which  Mary 
was  a  party  by  consent.  She  was  only  a  maiden, 
truly,  but  a  tender  conscience  and  resolute  will  would 
have  dared,  for  honor's  sake,  to  offend  unscrupulous 
aspirants  for  crowns.  On  the  4th  of  April,  Mary 
signed,  at  Fontainebleau,  two  secret  acts  of  sweeping 
and  dangerous  import.  The  first  of  these  acts  was  a 
full  and  free  donation  of  Scotland  to  the  Kings  of 
France,  in  consideration  of  the  services  which  those 
monarchs  had  at  all  times  rendered  to  Scotland,  by 
defending  her  against  the  English,  her  ancient  and 
inveterate  enemies,  and  especially  for  the  assistance 
which  she  had  received  from  Xing  ITcnry  IT.,  who 
had  maintained  her  independence  at  his  own  expense 
during  the  minority  of  her  Queen.  "  The  second  act 
seemed  framed  merely  to  meet  the  case  of  the  non- 
execution  of  the  first,  in  which  she  also  conveyed  to 
him  any  claims  which  might  accrue  to  her  upon  Eng- 
land and  Ireland.  The  usufruct  of  the  kingdom  of 
Scotland  was  granted  to  the  King  of  France,  until 
he  should  have  been  repaid  the  sums  which  he  had 
expended  in  her  defence.  Estimating  these  sums  at 
a  million  of  pieces  of  eight,  which  Scotland,  in  her 
existing  state  of  poverty,  could  not  restore,  Mary 
Stuart  ordained  that  the  King  of  France  should  have 
the  enjoyment  of  her  kingdom  until  they  were  en-

tiroly  liquidated.  With  the  e.in-mt  of  her 
the  Duke  of  Guise  and  the  Cardinal  of  Lorraine, 
whose  opinion  she  had  r.&gt;n~ulted  on  the  matter,  she 
thus  placed  Scotland  in  pledge  for  &lt;lrlits  which  Scot- 
land had  never  accepted." 

April  19th,  the  youthful  Queen  entered  into  tho 
most  solemn  engagements  with  the  commissioners, 
directly  in  opposition  to  her  private  pledges. 

"  The  eldest  son  sprung  of  this  marriage  was  to  be 
King  of  France,  and,  if  daughters  only  were  horn, 
the  eldest  of  them  was  to  her.. me  Queen  of  Seotland, 
to  receive  four  hundred  thousand  crowns  as  a  (laugh- 
ter of  France,  and  not  to  marry  without  the  consent 
of  both  the  estates  of  Scotland  and  the  King  of 
France;  the  Dauphin  was  to  assume  the  title  and 
arms  of  King  of  Scotland,  and  if  he  died  after  his 
accession  to  the  throne  of  K  ran  re,  the  Queen,  his 
•widow,  was  to  receive  a  jointure  of  six  hundred  thou- 
sand livres." 

Without  the  prospect  of  ultimate  benefit  to  Henry, 
the  conflicting  articles  of  agreement  were  a  sad  les- 
son for  Mary  in  the  art  of  royal  treachery.  The 
glow  of  virtuous  feeling  must  lose  intensity  by  such 
contact  and  yielding,  and  the  lovely  instrument  of 
ambitious  princes  did  not  escape  the  inevitable  result. 
This  was  the  day  of  her  betrothment,  and  in  con- 
formity with  custom,  it  was  performed  in  the  great 
hall  of  the  Louvre ;  the  scene  was  private,  and  closed 
with  a  brilliant  ball.  Paris  was  now  alive  with  prep- 
aration for  the  public  celebration  of  the  nuptials. 

The  workmen  were  busy  with  the  church  of  Notre 
Dame,  erecting  a  covered  gallery  to  connect  with  the 
Episcopal  palace  of  the  Bishop,  affording  to  the  spec-

tators  through  its  long  vista  a  view  of  the  royal  pro- 
cession when  it  entered.  It  was  lined  with  purple 
velvet,  and  embossed  with  rich  and  elaborate  orna- 
ments, and  opened  at  the  cathedral  into  an  amphi- 
theater of  grand  outline  and  finished  proportions. 
The  Sabbath  dawned,  and  the  throngs  of  excited  peo- 
ple were  hastening  towards  the  ample  area,  to  witness 
the  dazzling  pageant,  which  was  called  in  honor  of  the 
event  celebrated,  the  Triumph.  A  royal  canopy, 
strown  with  the  fleurs  de  lis,  which  were  symbols  of 
reverence  and  marriage,  hung  over  the  entrance  of 
Notre  Dame,  around  which  stood  the  papal  legate, 
archbishops  and  prelates,  in  their  sacerdotal  robes. 
Military  bands,  with  the  music  of  Swiss  melodies, 
joined  the  imposing  group  of  prelatical  magnates. 

After  these  came  the  Duke  of  Guise,  as  grand  mas- 
ter of  the  King's  household,  who,  having  with  his 
accustomed  dignity,  saluted  the  Bishop  of  Paris,  Car- 
dinal Eustathius  du  Bellay,  and  the  princes  of  the 
blood,  turned  towards  the  assembled  crowd,  and  per- 
ceiving that  they  were  impeded  in  their  view,  waved 
his  hand,  and  signified  to  the  grandees  that  they 
should  retire,  for  the  accommodation  of  the  lower 
orders,  whilst  he  himself  marshaled  the  procession, 
which  was  heralded  by  music.  The  performers  wore 
an  uniform  of  yellow  and  red;  but  endless  was  the 
variety  of  their  harmonious  strains,  in  which  the 
trumpet  and  the  lute,  the  bass-viol  and  the  flageolet, 
the  violin  and  hautboy,  all  intermingled  in  harmo- 
nious concert :  immediately  after  followed  the  two 
hundred  gentlemen  attached  to  the  King's  person; 
next,  the  princes  of  the  blood,  with  their  immediate 
attendants;  bishops  and  abbots,  before  whom  were

borne  their  CTOftien  and  mitros,  the  ensigns  of  their 

dignity;  a  cluster  of  high-capped  cardinals,  among 

in  were  con-pieuous  .John  of  Bourbon,  Charles  of 

;-aine.  and  .Inhii  of  (luisc;  lastly,  came  the  Pope's 

legate,  before  whom  was  borne  a  cross  of  massive 
gold;  after  the.-e  marched  the  l&gt;auphin  Francis,  con- 
ducted by  the  Kin::  of  Navarre.  Although  his  fee- 
ble and  ill-proportioned  figure  was  plainly  contrasted 
with  the  tall  martial  form  of  Anthony  of  Bourbon, 
the  impression  was  .somewhat  relieved  l&gt;y  the  presence 
of  bis  two  younger  brothers  the  1  hikes,  of  Orleans 
and  Angouleme.  Far  different  was  the  sensation 
created  by  the  ap)&gt;earance  of  his  fair  bride,  affection- 
ately supported  hy  her  father-in-law,  the  King  of 
France  and  who  was  also  attended  by  her  youthful 
kinsman,  the  Duke  of  Lorraine:  though  she  had  not 
completed  her  sixteenth  year,  her  stature  rose  con- 
siderably above  the  female  standard;  but  so  perfect 
was  the  symmetry  of  her  form,  and  so  graceful  were 
her  movements,  that  even  this  lofty  height  but  gave 
to  her  person  an  air  of  mingled  dignity  and  elegance, 
that  added  to  her  attractions.  On  this  day,  Bran- 
tome  describes  her,  as  l'  more  beautiful  and  charming 
than  a  celestial  goddess;  for  as  every  eye  dwelt  with 
rapture  on  her  face,  every  voice  echoed  her  praise; 
whilst,  universally,  in  the  court  and  city  it  was  re- 
echoed, happy,  thriee  happy,  the  prince  who  should 
call  her  his,  even  though  she  should  have  had  neither 
crown  nor  sceptre  to  bestow!"  Unlike  Brantorae, 
the  frigid  chronicler,  instead  of  expatiating  on 
Mary's  charm-,  de-eants  with  much  energy  on  her 
superb  attire:  "The  robe,  white  as  the  lily  with 
which  it  was  embroidered,  but  so  prodigally  rich  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  41 

gorgeous,  glittering  with  diamonds  and  silver,  as  to  be 
too  dazzling  for  words  to  describe."  Her  sweeping 
train  was  borne  by  two  young  girls,  whom  grace  and 
beauty  fitted  for  the  office;  her  neck  was  encircled 
with  a  diamond  carcanet,  from  which  was  suspended 
a  ring  of  inestimable  value ;  on  her  head  she  wore  a 
golden  coronet,  encircled  with  precious  stones,  in 
which  the  diamond,  the  ruby,  and  the  emerald  con- 
tended for  magnificence,  and  in  the  centre  of  the 
coronet  shone  a  carbuncle  valued  at  five  hundred 
crowns.  Although  it  was  impossible  but  that  such 
habiliments  should  have  attracted  the  vulgar  eye,  we 
may  be  permitted  to  suspect,  that  they  rather  dis- 
guised than  embellished  a  youthful  beauty;  nor  is  it 
an  equivocal  proof  of  Mary's  superior  grace,  that 
under  all  this  pomp  and  state,  she  preserved  her  ac- 
customed elegance  and  unembarrassed  movements. 
Behind  the  young  Queen  (not  without  secret  envy) 
walked  Catherine  de  Medicis,  with  the  Prince  de 
Conde;  after  whom  followed,  in  due  gradation,  Ma- 
dame Marguerite,  the  Queen  of  Navarre,  and  an  al- 
most interminable  train  of  ladies. 

When  the  procession  had  reached  the  great  door  of 
the  church,  the  King  drew  from  his  finger  a  ring, 
which  he  gave  to  the  Archbishop  of  Rouen,  who,  hav- 
ing placed  it  on  the  young  Queen's  finger,  pro- 
nounced the  nuptial  benediction.  Mutual  congratu- 
lations followed,  and  Mary  gracefully  saluted  her 
husband  by  the  title  of  King  of  Scots.  The  Scottish 
deputies,  whom  the  chronicler  does  not  once  deign 
to  mention,  followed  her  example;  after  which,  the 
Archbishop  of  Paris  delivered  a  suitable  discourse, 
which  probably,  received  little  attention.  In  the 


42  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

mean  time,  the  Duke  of  Guise  had  succeeded  in  In- 
efforts  to  induce  the  nobles  to  open  a  vista  to  tin- 
people,  who  stood  clustering  in  the  -tn-Hs  at  tin- 
windows,  on  turrets,  and  scaffoldings,  to  catch  a 
glimpse  of  the  imposing  spectacle;  but  not  even  his 
vigilance  and  activity  were  adequate  to  the  task  &lt;&gt;t' 
preserving  order  and  decorum  among  the  motley 
crowd;  and  when,  according  to  custom,  the  heralds, 
having  proclaimed  largess,  in  the  name  of  the  King 
and  Queen  of  Scots,  began  to  shower  money  on  the 
people:  "Then,"  says  the  chronicler,  "you  might 
have  witnessed  the  tumult  and  confusion  of  the  multi- 
tude; some,  in  their  avidity,  precipitating  themselves 
on  their  companions,  others  fainting,  whilst  many 
were  stript  of  hats,  cloaks,  or  even  skirts;  so  terrible 
was  the  conflict,  that  at  length  even  the  populace,  in 
dismay  unutterable,  implored  the  heralds  to  desist 
from  throwing  among  them  the  golden  bait  of  dis- 
cord." 

The  bridal  procession  advanced  to  the  choir,  or 
main  space  of  the  edifice,  under  the  royal  canopy, 
and  celebrated  mass.  This  was  followed  by  a  costly 
collation  in  the  bishop's  palace,  and  then  a  ball.  At 
five  o'clock  in  the  evening  the  royal  train  returned  to 
their  palace.  The  two  Queens  of  France  sat  together 
in  a  litter  escorted  by  cardinals;  Henry  and  Francis 
rode  on  horseback,  and  after  them  on  richly  capari- 
soned steeds  came  the  ladies  of  princely  rank.  The 
Duke  of  Guise  presided  over  the  ceremonies  of  the 
evening  entertainment.  The  King's  band  of  a  hundred 
men  poured  through  the  ample  apartment  strains  of 
ravishing  music.  While  the  guests  were  becoming 
animated  with  the  prospective  pleasures,  twelve  arti- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  43 

ficial  horses,  mantled  in  golden  cloth,  entered  with 
the  motion  of  life,  and  bestrode  by  sons  of  the  nobil- 
ity. Next  came  a  company  of  pilgrims,  each  recit- 
ing a  poem;  then  were  ushered  into  the  hall  six  di- 
minutive galleys,  "  covered  like  Cleopatra's  barge, 
with  cloth  of  gold  and  crimson  velvet;  so  skillfully 
contrived  as  to  appear  to  glide  through  the  waves, 
sometimes  rolling,  sometimes  tacking,  then  veering, 
as  if  agitated  by  a  sudden  swell  of  the  tide  till  the  del- 
icate silken  sails  were  cracked  asunder."  Upon  the 
deck  of  each  sat  a  cavalier,  who,  while  the  miniature 
navy  moved  along,  in  turn  sprang  to  land,  and  seized 
a  fair  lady,  bearing  her  to  a  vacant  chair  ready  for 
her  reception.  After  these  splendid  panoramic  scenes 
there  was  a  grand  tournament,  in  which  Francis, 
from  physical  debility,  was  forbidden  to  break  a 
lance.  For  fifteen  days  this  extravagant  and  re- 
splendent festivity  continued. 

To  the  parliament  of  this  nation,  the  commission- 
ers returned,  believing  their  instructions  faithfully 
fulfilled;  and  December  following  the  marriage  of 
Mary,  their  mission  and  its  results  were  ratified  by 
that  body,  and  the  matrimonial  crown  was  bestowed 
upon  Francis.  It  was  also  ordered  that  future  acts 
be  published  in  the  name  of  u  Francis  and  Mary, 
King  and  Queen  of  Scotland,  Dauphin  and  Dauphi- 
ness  of  \^ienne." 

The  youthful  sovereigns  retired  to  a  country  resi- 
dence near  Paris,  while  the  highlands  of  Scotland 
echoed  back  the  shouts,  and  shone  with  the  illumina- 
tions of  popular  rejoicing,  as  the  tidings  of  the  mar- 
riage spread.  But  these  soon  died  away  before  the

practical  developments  tli;it  .-ucceed(d  the  Surface  ex- 
citement of  ;i  kingdom. 

The  Queen  I)owager  having  secured  her  object,  be- 
iran  t&lt;»  show  without  disguise  her  French  affinities,  in 
official  appointments  and  treating  carelessly  those 
whose  influence  .she  had  he  fore  feared.  Tliis  palpa- 
hle  change  in  the  excn-ise  of  her  sovereignty,  gave  a 
decisive  blow  to  the  supremacy  of  foreign  views;  it 
broke  the  spell  of  quiet  control  which  bad  stolen  over 
the  people  from  the  court  of  France.  Another  cause 
of  threatening  disquietude  was  the  conflict  of  Calvin- 
ism with  prelacy.  The  Queen  of  Navarre,  and  other 
distinguished  subjects  of  Henry,  warmly  espoused 
the  cause  of  reform,  sustained  as  it  was  by  intellect, 
intelligence,  and  purity  of  both  worship  and  life.  In 
Scotland,  the  Earl  of  Arrnn  sympathised  with  the  re- 
formers. Just  as  this  crisis  was  reached,  Mary  Tudor 
of  England  died,  and  the  Protestant  Elizabeth  as- 
cended the  throne,  restoring  immediately,  on  the 
second  downfall  of  popery,  the  faith  of  her  father, 
Henry  VIII.,  and  of  her  brother,  Edward  VI.  As 
goon  as  this  new  order  of  things  was  established,  in- 
troduced November,  1558,  Mary  Stuart's  relation  to 
England  assumed  an  aspect  widely  different  from 
that  occupied  before,  and  modified  es-entially  the  con- 
dition of  factions  in  her  native  realm.  Elizabeth 
was  declared  by  the  French  court,  in  accordance  with 
the  Catholic  sentiment,  illegitimate;  and  Mary,  as  a 
direct  descendant  of  Henry  VII.,  through  Margaret 
Tudor,  was  deemed  heir  to  the  crown.  The  King  of 
France,  with  a  strange  infatuation,  ordered  the  arms 
of  England  t..  }«•  quartered  on  the  regal  escutcheon 
with  those  of  Scotland,  proclaiming  by  the  act,  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  45 

assumed  right  and  the  aspiration  to  the  sceptre  of 
England,  in  behalf  of  the  Dauphin  and  Dauphiness. 
These  disclosures  naturally  aroused  the  fiery  spirit  of 
the  English  Queen,  who  saw  in  Mary  her  rival  to 
royalty  and  glory.  Under  the  hloody  reign  of  her 
sister,  she  had  lived  in  comparative  seclusion,  dissem- 
bling the  religious  faith  and  strong  feelings,  which 
were  cherished  like  subterranean  fires,  beneath  an 
exterior  haughtily  calm,  and  delusively  smiling. 
Giovanni  Michele,  the  Venetian  ambassador,  de- 
scribes her  person,  accomplishments,  and  hints  at  her 
character,  in  his  records  of  the  times,  when  Elizabeth 
was  twenty-three  years  of  age : 

"  She  is  no  less  remarkable  in  body  than  in  mind, 
although  her  features  are  rather  agreeable  than  beau- 
tiful. She  is  tall  in  person  and  well-made ;  her  com- 
plexion is  brilliant  though  rather  dark.  She  has  fine 
eyes-;  but  above  all,  a  splendid  hand,  which  she  is  very 
fond  of  showing.  She  possesses  great  tact  and  abil- 
ity, as  she  has  abundantly  proved  by  the  wise  way  in 
which  she  has  conducted  herself  in  the  midst  of  the 
suspicions  of  which  she  was  the  object,  and  of  the 
perils  which  surrounded  her.  She  surpasses  the 
Queen,  her  sister,  in  her  knowledge  of  languages. 
Besides  English,  Spanish,  French,  Italian,  and  Latin, 
which  she  knows  as  well  as  her  sister,  she  has  no  slight 
acquaintance  with  Greek.  She  is  haughty  and  high- 
spirited.  Although  born  of  a  mother  beheaded  for 
adultery,  she  esteems  herself  no  less  highly  than  the 
Queen,  her  sister,  and  considers  herself  equally  legiti- 
mate. It  is  said  that  she  is  very  much  like  the  King, 
her  father,  to  whom  she  was  always  very  dear  on  that 
account,  and  who  had  her  as  well  educated  as  the 


46  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Queen,  and  made  an  equal  pn&gt;\ -i-ion  for  them  both  in 
his  will." 

Kli/aheth  was  clearly  Mary  Smart's  superior  in 
vigorous  intellect,  masculine  judgment,  and  general 
force  of  character ;  while  she  was  her  equal,  if  not  in 
beauty,  in  mental  culture  and  the  fascination  of  a 
lively  imagination.  Though  Ie&lt;s  gentle  and  winning 
than  her  rival,  she  was  endowed  with  the  qualities  of 
a  great  and  successful  Queen.  Surrounding  herself 
with  a  cabinet  of  strong  minds  and  devoted-  hearts, 
she  swayed  them  and  her  subjects  with  a  will  which 
disdained  counsel,  only  as  an  expression  of  views 
which  might  strengthen,  without  controlling  her  own 
unbiased  decisions.  She  declared  this  independence 
with  self-glorying,  when  she  said,  "  that  she  would  let 
the  world  know  that  there  was  in  England  a  woman 
who  acted  like  a  man,  and  who  was  awed  neither  by  a 
constable  of  Montmorency,  like  the  King  of  France, 
nor  by  a  bishop  of  Anas,  like  the  King  of  Spain." 
The  reformers  and  restive  parties  of  Scotland  found 
a  friend  in  the  English  sovereign,  and  these  events 
ripened  the  royal  collision ;  when  changes  in  France 
gave  a  new  form  and  interest  to  the  struggle  for  do- 
minion. 

The  26th  of  June,  1  ."•:•'.»,  was  appointed  for  the  es- 
pousals of  Elizabeth,  the  eldest  (laughter  of  Henry, 
to  Philip  of  Spain.  The  order  of  arrangements  re- 
sembled that  of  Mary's  marriage.  The  princess 
passed  the  night  of  the  24th  in  the  bishop's  palace, 
and  was  led  to  the  altar  of  Not  re  Dame  through  a 
covered  gallery,  attended  with  the  lavish  display  of 
royal  trea-nn-.  which  never  failed,  whether  the  poor 
and  toiling  masses  were  fed,  or  whether  they  were

lifting  their  piteous  cry  for  bread.  The  bride  ap- 
peared in  robes  of  golden  texture,  studded  with  dia- 
monds, her  brow  resplendent  with  a  crown  of  jewels, 
beneath  which  beamed  her  dark  and  expressive  eyes, 
while  the  flush  of  excitement  betrayed  a  sensitive  na- 
ture, oppressed  with  the  burden  of  queenly  honors. 
This  gorgeous  scene  was  succeeded  by  banquets  and 
balls,  with  the  usual  pageant  of  a  grand  tournament. 

The  Place  Antoine  was  selected  for  the  field  of  con- 
test. V 

An  ample  theatre  was  erected  for  the  spectators, 
and  crowded  with  noble  and  anxious  beholders.  Never 
before  was  gathered  to  such  an  entertainment  so  great 
an  assemblage  of  foreign  princes,  ambassadors,  and 
generals.  The  national  costumes  and  the  insignia  of 
rank  bewildered  the  eye.  That  vain  glory  winch  had 
emblazoned  on  the  heraldic  scroll  Mary's  claim  to 
the  sceptre  of  England,  displayed  the  device  on  the 
Dauphin's  banners,  carried  by  his  band,  who  opened 
the  jousts.  The  British  ambassadors  frowned,  and 
the  attendants  of  the  fair  Stuart  exclaimed,  as  she 
was  borne  to  her  royal  balcony,  "  Place,  place  for  the 
Queen  of  England !  "  There  can  be  no  apology  for 
this  insult  to  Elizabeth  of  England,  which  fore- 
shadowed future  sorrow. 

The  next  day  King  Henry  entered  the  lists.  His 
fine  figure  and  stately  bearing  were  well  set  off  by  his 
black  and  white  costume;  and  near  him  rode  the 
Duke  of  Guise,  who,  in  honor  of  a  remembered 
beauty,  wore  a  crimson  livery.  The  monarch  won 
victories,  and  was  applauded  by  the  excited  multi- 
tude. The  third  day  of  the  tournament,  he  was  rid- 
ing with  a  heart  animated  and  proud  with  success,

over  the  plain  strown  with  tlio  tokens  of  conflict,  when 
he  discovered  two  unbroken  hup  E  i'-i»g  one  of 

them,  he  challenged  ('omit  Montgommeri  to  wield 
the  other.  The  count  hoitated,  and  the  King's  fam- 
ily sent  nit.-- ;i-.-s  of  ex|N. -filiation,  as  if  a  dread  pre- 
sentiment of  evil  hail  clouded  their  joy.  But  flushed 
and  ardent,  he  ordered  Montgoimueri  to  wheel  for 
comhat.  The  signal  was  iriven,  and  amidst  the  wild 
acclamation-  of  the  people,  the  brave  steeds  bore  their 
riders  toward  the  deceive  encounter.  Henry's  mar- 
tial air  was  never  more  kingly  as  he  dashed  toward 
the  graceful  Alontirommeri.  The  lances  met,  and 
Henry  reeled  in  his  saddle,  while  a  hush,  then  cries  of 
alarm,  followed  the  tragical  close  of  popular  re- 
joiciiii:-.  A  splinter  of  the  count's  lance  had  pierced 
the  visor,  and  when  the  helmet  was  lifted,  large  red 
drops  oo/ed  from  his  death-wound.  He  exonerated 
his  victor  from  Maine,  and  after  suffering  eleven 
•  lays,  died  -Inly  10th,  1559. 

Pasquier,  in  his  annals  of  those  times,  gives  the 
impression  made  on  the  pnhlie  mind  liy  this  fatal 
combat.  He  alludes  to  the  alliance  and  treaty  with 
Philip  of  Spain,  and  the  persecution  of  Protestants, 
which  followed  a  union  of  the  Catholic  monarchs, 
secured  by  the  interference  of  a  ,!e.-uitical  monk. 
Pasquier  will  not  allow  what  strikes  the  serious  stu- 
dent of  history  as  altogether  probable,  that  Henry's 
fate  was  a  rebuke  from  Heaven,  of  his  vaunting  am- 
bition. 

"  This  deplorable  catastrophe  has  given  rise  to  var- 
ious sinister  reflections;  and  there  are  some  who  fancy 
they  .discover  in  it  the  visible  retribution  of  Provi- 
dence, since,  if  we  may  credit  the  assertions  of  Car-

dinal  Lorraine,  the  King  had  hurried  the  peace  pur- 
posely, that  he  might  be  at  leisure  to  extirpate  by 
force,  the  heresy  of  Calvin.  With  this  view,  he  sud- 
denly presented  himself  to  the  parliament,  on  the 
10th  of  June,  to  collect  the  various  opinions  of  the 
members,  of  whom  the  majority  recommended  the 
suspension  of  penal  laws,  and  the  convocation  of  a 
general  council.  In  the  course  of  these  deliberations, 
the  King,  having  heard  certain  sentiments,  with 
which  he  was  justly  offended,  ordered  several  of  the 
orators  to  be  taken  into  custody.  They  were  instantly 
conveyed  to  the  Bastile,  whence,  according  to  certain 
sinister  interpreters,  the  evil  has  lighted  upon  him 
by  the  special  will  of  God,  for  having  interrupted 
men  in  the  exercise  of  their  official  duties.  It  is  also 
observed  that,  as  it  was  on  the  10th  of  June  that  he 
consigned  the  counselors  to  the  Bastile,  so  it  was  on 
the  10th  of  July  that  he  received  the  stroke  of  death ; 
thus  reason  the  misjudging  multitude,  who  speak 
from  passion  rather  than  reason.  But  it  is  a  singular 
fact  that  he  should  have  commenced  his  reign  on  the 
10th  of  June,  with  the  combat  of  Jarnac  and  la

"  His  corpse  lies  in  state  in  the  very  hall  which  he 
had  erected  for  the  celebration  of  the  nuptial  festivi- 
ties. The  constable,  in  disgrace,  watches  the  corpse ; 
the  Guises  are  omnipotent,  the  young  King  having 
espoused  their  niece ;  the  queen-mother  is  greatly  com- 
miserated; and  consternation  universally  prevails 
with  the  people." 

During  the  last  moments  of  Henry,  amid  the  lu-

mentations  and  tears  of  relatives,  according  to  Mary's 
desire,  Cardinal  Lorraine  and  Duke  of  Guise  were 
selected  as  the  future  ministers  of  the  Dauphin.  To 
complete  the  arrangements  for  a  permanent  harmony 
with  foreign  sovereign-,  Margaret,  the  younger  sis- 
ter of  Francis,  was  privately  married  to  the  Duke  of 
Savoy,  in  the  light  of  ton-lies,  with  an  epithdtwmium 
of  convulsive  sobs,  and  the  almost  audible  gasping 
of  the  dying  monarch.  Francis  was  confined  to  his 
couch  in  the  palace  of  Tournelles,  when  the  officers 
of  state  entered  his  apartment,  and  umonnced  his 
father's  death,  on  the  hended  knee  of  loyalty,  by  salut- 
ing him  King.  As  if  an  unearthly  voice  had  sent 
the  health-thrill  along  his  nerves,  he  sprang  from  his 
bed,  and  declared  he  was  well.  Such  is  the  mastery 
of  ambition  ;  jt  ^ivcs  to  boyhood  the  front  of  a  heart- 
less trifler  with  human  affection  and  the  soul's  de- 
parture to  eternal  scenes,  and  like  the  eagle  whose 
eye  confronts  the  sun,  it  gazes  restlessly  though 
vainly  upon  the  veiled  -plendor  of  the  "White 
Throne."  Scarcely  had  Francis  conferred  with  his 
counselors,  het'ore  his  mother  joined  them,  to  accom- 
pany him  to  the  Louvre,  where  would  be  offered  the 
usual  congratulations  and  homage,  upon  the  transfer 
of  a  crown  to  the  brow  of  a  successor.  .Mary  silently 
followed  in  the  train,  when  Catherine,  who  saw  the 
declining  glory  of  her  family,  in  the  elevation  of  the 
Guises,  said  to  her,  "  Pass  on,  madam  ;  it  is  now  for 
you  to  take  precedence;"  The  young  Queen  acknowl- 
edged the  civility,  but  on  reaching  the  chariot,  re- 
fused to  enter,  until  the  desponding  and  ambitious 
widow  passed  in  before  her.  The  Dauphin  was 
crowned  at  Eheims,  where  that  ceremony  had  been 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  51 

performed  on  many  previous  kings  of  France,  and 
immediately  assumed  the  reins  of  government. 

In  the  meantime,  the  revolution  in  Scotland,  re- 
motely kindled  by  the  revolution  tones  of  Luther's 
voice,  and,  favored  by  the  brave  martyr,  Wishart,  and 
the  fearless  Knox,  had  gone  forward  among  the  peo- 
ple. Lord  James  Stuart,  the  Queen's  brother,  Lord 
John  Erskine,  and  Lord  Lorn,  had  joined  the  stan- 
dard of  the  bold  reformer,  with  other  influential  bar- 
ons, and  formed  themselves  into  religious  congrega- 
tions. Wherever  Knox  was  summoned  by  the  of- 
fended priesthood,  he  scattered  the  live  coals  of  truth 
upon  the  popular  mind.  At  length,  emboldened  and 
encouraged  by  success,  he  appealed  to  the  regent, 
Mary  of  Lorraine,  for  royal  sanction  to  the  new  doc- 
trines. She  met  his  demand  with  scorn,  and  assured 
him  it  was  time  to  interpose  a  barrier  to  the  waves  of 
revolution,  dangerous  both  to  church  and  state. 
Knox  was  obliged  to  fly  from  the  wrathful  enemy  to 
his  retreat — Geneva,  the  home  of  Calvin.  Soon  after 
followed  the  solemn  Covenant  proposed  by  the  exiled 
reformer,  which  was  a  mutual  pledge  by  the  Protes- 
tants to  openly  expose  the  corruptions  of  Rome,  and 
worship  Grod  according  to  their  own  conscience.  They 
farther  formed  an  insurrectionary  government,  called 
the  Lords  of  .the  Congregation,  which  prepared  the 
way  for  bloody  collision  with  the  state. 

The  regent,  elated  with  prosperity  in  her  favorite 
plans,  became  more  intolerant,  until  she  virtually  de- 
clared civil  war,  by  affirming  the  decisions  of  the 
bishops  against  heretics,  and  declaring  her  purpose 
to  restore,  on  the  overthrow  of  the  reformers,  the  uni- 
versal sway  of  the  Catholic  church.  Some  of  the 


52  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

fiercest  battles  of  the  Covenanters  were  fought  about 
the  time  Henry  of  France  received  the  fatal  lance  of 
Montgonimeri.  An  armistice,  extending  to  July 
24th,  1560,  followed. 

This  interlude  was  employed  by  the  regent  in  send- 
ing a  requisition  to  her  daughter  for  French  troops, 
who  were  inactive,  because  of  the  peace  of  Cateau- 
Cambresis,*  while  Knox  proceeded  to  Berwick,  to  ne- 
gotiate with  the  English  governor  for  ships  and  sol- 
diers, with  which  the  Protestant  cause  might  l&gt;c  &gt;u-- 
tained  against  foreign  foes.  Elizabeth's  sympathies 
and  jealousy  of  Mary  inclined  her  to  comply  with  his 
request;  but  she  disliked  both  the  term  champion, 
who  had  written  against  female  sovereignty  in  the 
state,  and  the  Presbyterian  form  of  the  revolution. 
She  first  sent  them  three  thousand  pounds  sterling, 
and  after  the  Lords  of  the  Congregation  in  public  as- 
sembly passed  a  resolution,  deposing  the  queen-regent, 
she  agreed  to  furnish  men  and  munitions  of  war,  on 
condition  of  reciprocity  in  case  the  French  turned 
their  arms  against  the  Queen  of  England.  The  revo- 
lutionary party  preserved  the  appearance  of  loyalty 
to  their  sovereign,  by  making  the  treaty  in  her  name, 
with  the  promise  of  obedience  to  her  commands  in  all 
things  that  did  not  tend  to  molest  the  ancient  laws 
and  liberties  of  the  land.  Elizabeth  replied  to  the 
charge  of  intervention  in  the  affairs  of  Scotland,  in 
the  following  strain,  denying  that  the  nobility  of  that 
realm  were  rebels : 

*  This  treaty,  signed  April  2-3,  1559,  contained  a  secret 
article  by  which  Henry  II.  of  France  and  Granvella,  acting 
in  the  Netherlands  for  Philip  II.  of  Spain,  formed  an  alliance 
for  the  purpose  of  exterminating  "  heresy,"  that  is,  Protes- 
tantism. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  53 

"  And  truly,  if  these  barons  should  permit  the  gov- 
ernment of  their  kingdom  to  be  wrested  out  of  their 
hands  during  the  absence  of  their  Queen;  if  they 
tamely  gave  up  the  independence  of  their  native 
country,  whilst  she  used  the  counsel,  not  of  the  Scots, 
but  solely  of  the  French,  her  mother  and  other  for- 
eigners being  her  advisers  in  Scotland,  and  the  Car- 
dinal and  Duke  of  Guise  in  France,  it  were  a  good 
cause  for  the  world  to  speak  shame  of  them ;  nay,  if 
the  young  Queen  herself  should  happen  to  survive 
her  husband,  she  would  in  such  a  case  have  just  occa- 
sion to  condemn  them  all  as  cowards  and  unnatural 
subjects." 

During  the  long  and  remarkable  siege  of  Leith, 
which  followed  these  events,  Mary  of  Lorraine,  ex- 
hausted with  anxiety  and  care,  was  taken  sick,  and 
conveyed  to  Edinburgh  castle.  She  was  soon  aware 
of  approaching  dissolution,  and  asked  an  interview 
with  the  leaders  of  the  Protestant  party.  The  meet- 
ing was  kind  and  affecting.  She  recounted  the  trou- 
bles of  her  kingdom,  whose  burden  had  hastened  her 
death,  and  advised  the  removal  of  all  foreign  troops, 
and  an  adherence  to  that  alliance  which  would  best 
preserve  their  national  independence.  Then  embrac- 
ing them  with  a  dying  kiss,  she  died  amid  their  tears, 
June  10th,  1560.  She  had  intellect  and  heart;  but, 
led  by  ambition,  and  ruled  by  French  advisers,  she 
embittered  her  widowhood,  involved  her  enthroned 
daughter  in  mournful  calamities,  and  breathed  her 
last,  encircled  with  foes  instead  of  family  friends, 
whom  she  left  in  her  native  clime,  for  the  empty 
honors  of  a  brief  regency.  A  treaty  of  peace  sealed 
after  her  decease,  contained  the  following  articles: 


54  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  The  French  troops  were  to  evacuate  Scotland ;  the 
fortifications  of  Leith  to  be  demolished;  the  sover- 
eigns of  France  cease  to  bear  the  arms  and  title  of 
King  and  Queen  of  England;  the  Duke  of  Chatel- 
henmlt  and  other  Scottish  nobles  who  possessed  prop- 
erty in  Fninee,  to  luivc  re-toivd  to  tlicin  the  huids  ;in&lt;l 
titles  of  \vhieh  they  hud  been  deprived  since  their 
rebellion ;  the  high  offices  of  Chancellor,  Treasurer, 
and  Comptroller  to  be  conferred  not  upon  ecclesiastics 
but  upon  laymen;  and  the  guardianship  as  well  as 
the  administration  of  the  kingdom  never  to  be  again 
entrusted  to  foreign  soldiers  and  dignitaries.  The 
conduct  of  affairs  was  to  be  confided  to  a  council  of 
twelve  members,  seven  of  whom  were  to  be  nominated 
by  the  Queen,  and  five  by  the  estates  of  the  realm; 
and  this  council  was  instructed  to  introduce  a  bet- 
ter system  into  the  government  of  the  country.  It 
was  also  agreed  that  a  free  Parliament  should  as- 
semble in  the  month  of  August." 

Kiiirlish  influence  and  the  reformers  were  now 
fairly  in  the  ascendant. 

Meanwhile  the  health  of  Francis  II.,  which  had  al- 
ways been  frail,  rapidly  failed.  The  Guises  were 
busy  with  plans  for  the  extermination  of  Protestant- 
ism in  France,  which,  with  other  ambitions  and  law- 
less schemes,  sowed  the  seeds  of  a  terrible  harvest  for 
unhappy  France.  The  young  King  was  no  more 
than  the  toy  of  their  fancy.  One  day  suddenly  faint- 
iiii:,  he  was  borne  to  his  chamber  to  die.  Mary 
watehed  by  his  bedside  faithfully,  whose  kindness  he 
appreciated  with  child-like  gratitude,  and  for  whom 
he  desired  of  Catherine,  his  mother,  maternal  interest. 
He  expired  Deeeinher  nth,  1560,  separating  in  his 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  55 

death  the  crowns  of  Scotland  and  France,  and  sus- 
pending the  almost  imperial  po\ver  of  the  Princes  of 
Lorraine.  However  truly  Mary  may  have  mourned 
the  loss  of  Francis  as  a  husband,  in  a  political  view 
the  union  had  been  of  disastrous  omen  to  her  future 
prospects.  It  had  given  energy  and  triumph  to  the 
Reformation,  made  the  French  odious,  and  shorn  the 
regal  authority  of  its  strength  and  majesty  to  the 
Scotch  nation.  Mary  saw  the  extent  of  her  bereave- 
ment— left  an  orphan  and  widow  at  eighteen,  and 
compelled  to  abandon  a  throne,  for  the  regency  of 
Catherine  de  Medicis,  whose  aspirations  for  power 
were  so  revived  by  the  Stuart's  affliction,  that  she 
seemed  cheerfully  to  sacrifice  an  inefficient  son.  The 
Queen,  sadly  beautiful  in  her  grief,  retired  to  seclu- 
sion in  the  palace,  whose  solitude  for  several  weeks 
was  broken  only  by  the  presence  of  immediate  rela- 
tives. The  device  which  she  invented  for  a  mourn- 
ing seal  was  a  liquorice  tree,  whose  root  only  is  val- 
uable ;  beneath  it  was  "  Dulce  meum  terra  tegit " — 
My  treasure  is  in  the  ground.  The  following  letter 
was  written  in  answer  to  messages  of  condolence  from 
Philip;  and  in  its  brevity  exhibits  a  refined  sense  of 
propriety,  while  its  sentiment  is  altogether  womanly 
and  touching: 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  KING  PHILIP  n. 

"  To  the  King  of  Spain. 

"  Monsieur  my  good  Brother — I  was  unwilling  to 
omit  this  opportunity  of  writing  to  you,  to  thank  you 
for  the  polite  letters  you  sent  me  by  Signer  Don  An- 
tonio, and  for  the  civil  things  which  he  and  your  am- 


56  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

bassador  said  to  me  concerning  the  sorrow  you  felt 
for  the  death  of  the  late  King,  my  lord,  assuring 
you,  monsieur  my  good  brother,  that  you  have  lost  in 
him  the  best  brother  you  ever  had,  and  that  you  here 
comforted  by  your  letters  the  most  afflicted,  poor 
woman  under  heaven,  God  having  bereft  me  of  all 
that  I  loved  and  held  dear  on  earth,  and  left  me  no 
other  consolation  whatever  but  when  I  see  those  who 
deplore  his  loss  and  my  too  great  misfortune.  God 
will  assist  me,  if  he  pleases,  to  bear  what  comes  from 
him  with  patience ;  as  I  confess  that,  without  his  aid, 
I  should  find  so  great  a  calamity  too  insupportable 
for  my  strength  and  my  little  virtue.  But,  knowing 
that  it  is  not  reasonable  you  should  be  annoyed  by 
my  letters,  which  can  only  be  filled  with  this  melan- 
choly subject,  I  will  conclude,  after  beseeching  you 
to  be  a  good  brother  to  me  in  my  affliction,  and  to  con- 
tinue me  in  your  favor,  to  which  I  affectionately  com- 
mend myself,  praying  God  to  give  you,  monsieur  my 
good  brother,  as  much  happiness  as  I  wish  you. 
"  Your  very  good  sister  and  cousin, 

"  MART." 

Elizabeth  of  England  sent  the  Earl  of  Bedford  to 
convey  her  condolence  to  her  mourning  rival.  After 
this  duty  was  performed,  he  urged  the  Queen,  as 
Throckmorton,  the  English  ambassador,  had  before 
vainly  done,  to  ratify  the  treaty  of  Edinburgh.  It  is 
not  singular  that  she  continued  to  refuse,  while  her 
aspirings  towards  a  foreign  throne  were  cherished  by 
the  controlling  minds  of  the  house  of  Lorraine.  She 
expressed  the  desire  to  have  a  personal  interview  with 
Elizabeth,  and  requested  her  portrait;  and  thus  ter- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  57 

minated  the  two-fold  mission  of  the  earl.  The  Span- 
ish ambassador  was  among  the  first  foreign  officials 
admitted  to  the  presence  of  Mary,  and  Catherine  saw 
» in  the  incident  the  foreshadowing  of  an  offer  of  mar- 
riage to  Don  Carlos,  son  of  Philip  II. 

The  sovereigns  of  Sweden  and  Denmark  also  as- 
pired to  a  similar  honor.  The  regent  of  France, 
from  suspicion  of  an  alliance  unfavorable  to  her  aug- 
menting power,  or  prompted  by  a  cherished  antipathy 
to  Mary,  intimated  to  the  duke  and  cardinal  her  wish 
to  have  the  attractive  young  Queen  more  remote  from 
the  arena  of  her  own  ambitious  designs.  The  duke 
therefore,  who  was  a  man  of  high  spirit  and  no  prin- 
ciple, persuaded  his  niece  to  depart  for  Rheims, 
where  her  mother's  form  was  buried.  Thence  she 
was  to  visit  her  grandmother,  Duchess  of  Guise,  at 
Joinville,  who  still  lived  in  dismal  solitude ;  and,  soon 
after  as  possible,  embark  for  Scotland.  Mary  loved 
the  sunny  clime  of  France.  It  had  been  the  home  of 
her  childhood,  and  her  dead  were  there.  Her  sensi- 
tive nature  recoiled  from  the  cold  air  and  sterner 
manners  of  her  native  land.  At  this  crisis  a  letter 
was  written  from  the  "  Laird  of  Lethington  "  to  Sir 
William  Cecil,  that  gives  a  comprehensive  view  of  the 
attitude  of  factions  in  Scotland,  and  from  which  a 
passage  is  quoted,  disclosing  the  public  feeling  in 
view  of  Mary's  expected  advent : 

"  SIR  :  That  thus  long  I  have  delayed  to  write  unto 
your  honor,  I  pray,  impute  it  only  to  my  absence.  I 
have  been  these  forty  days  in  the  north  parts  of  Scot- 
land with  my  Lord  James,  where  we  have  not  been 
altogether  unoccupied;  but  so  far  as  occasion  would 


58  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

serve,  advancing  the  religion  and  common  cause. 
Since  our  returning,  I  have  understood  the  stay  of 
Monsieur  d'Oyscl,  and  judge  that  you  have  wisely 
foreseen  the  inconveniences  that  might  have  followed 
upon  his  coming  hither".  I  do  also  allow  your  opinion 
anent  the  Queen  our  sovereign's  journey  toward  - 
Scotland  ;  whose  coming  hither,  if  she  be  enemy  to 
the  religion,  and  so  affected  towards  that  realm,  as 
she  yet  appeareth,  shall  not  fail  to  raise  wonderful 
tragedies.  Although  the  religion  here  hath  in  out- 
ward aj)j&gt;rfirnnrc  the  upper  hand,  and  few  or  none 
there  be  that  openly  dare  profess  the  contrary,  yet 
know  we  the  hollow  hearts  of  a  great  tunnlx-r,  who 
would  be  ylad  to  see  it  and  MS  overthrown  :  nml  if  ////»/' 
served,  would  join  with  In  r  authority  to  that  effect: 
but  I  foresee,  that  the  difficulty  thereof  shall  make 
that  which  is  most  principal  in  intention  be  last  in 
•ution.  Sure  I  am,  the  suppressing  of  religion  is 
chiefly  meant,  but  the  same  must  be  pressed  but 
by  indirect  means.  First  of  all,  the  comfort  which 
we  have  of  the  Queen's  majesty's*  friendship  must 
be  cut  off  by  dissolution  of  the  intelligence  In'gun  of 
late;  which  being  not  feasible  in  her  absence,  her  own 
pre-encr  will  make  more  easy.  The  Papists,  you 
know,  be  in  their  hearts,  for  religion's  sake,  alto- 
gether enemii-&lt;  of  this  conjunction.  Those  that  gave 
themselves  forth  for  Protestants  be  not  all  alike  car- 
ne-tly  Ix-'iit  to  maintain  it.  Some  have  been  aceu&lt;- 
tomed  so  to  i'eed  upon  the  French  fare,  that  their 
delicate  stomachs  cannot  well  diiie^t  any  other.  Some

be  so  covetous,  that  wheresoever  the  lure  of  commo- 
dity is  showed  unto  them,  thither  will  they  fly.  Some 
so  inconstant,  that  they  may  be  easily  carried  away 
by  the  countenance  of  their  princess'  presence,  some- 
times showing  them  a  good  visage,  and  sometimes,  as 
occasion  shall  require,  frowning  on  them.  Others 
there  be  so  careless  and  ignorant,  that  they  will  rather 
respect  their  present  ease,  which  shall  bring  after  it 
most  grievous  calamities,  than  with  the  hazard  of  a 
little  present  incommodity  put  them  and  theirs  in 
full  security  afterwards :  these  to  be  a  great  number, 
in  our  late  danger,  we  had  large  experience;  yet  I 
doubt  not  but  the  best  sort  will  constantly  and  stoutly 
bear  out  that  which  they  have  begun.  Marry,  what 
difficulty  and  hazard  shall  be  in  it,  you  may  judge, 
when  the  Queen  shall  so  easily  win  to  her  party  the 
whole  Papists,  and  so  many  Protestants  as  be  either 
addicted  to  the  French  faction,*  covetous,  inconsis- 
tent, uneasy,  ignorant,  or  careless.  So  long  as  her 
highness  is  absent,  in  this  case,  there  is  no  peril ;  but 
you  may  judge  what  the  presence  of  a  prince,  being 
craftily  counseled,  is  able  to  bring  to  pass.  Every  man 
once  in  a  year  hath  to  do  with  his  prince's  benevo- 
lence ;  if  at  that  time,  when  his  particular  business  oc- 
curreth,  her  countenance  shall  be  but  strange  to  him 
in  sight  of  the  peril,  in  what  case  shall  the  subject 
then  be  ?  Every  man  hath  in  his  private  causes  some 
enemy  or  unfriend :  what  boldness  shall  they  not  take, 
seeing  an  advantage,  and  knowing  their  adversary  to 
be  out  of  the  prince's  good  grace  ?  She  will  not  be 
served  with  those  that  bear  any  good-will  to  England. 
Some  quarrel  shall  be  picked  to  them,  not  directly  for

religion  at  the  first;  but  where  the  accusation  of 
heresy  would  be  odious,  men  must  be  charged  with 
treason.  The  like  of  this  in  that  realm,  I  think,  hath 
been  seen  in  Queen  Mary's  days;  a  few  numbers  thus 
disgraced,  dispatched,  or  dispersed,  the  rest  will  be 
an  easy  prey,  and  then  may  the  butchery  of  Bonner 
plainly  begin.  I  make  not  this  discourse  as  our 
meaning  to  debar  her  majesty  from  her  kingdom,  or 
that  we  would  wish  she  should  never  come  home  (for 
that  were  the  part  of  an  unnatural  subject,)  but 
rather  desiring  such  things  as  be  necessary  so  to  be 
provided  for  in  the  meantime,  that  neither  she,  by  fol- 
lowing the  wicked  advice  of  God's  enemies,  to  lose  the 
hearts  of  her  subjects,  neither  yet  so  many  as  tender 
the  glory  of  God  and  liberties  of  their  native  country, 
to  be  the  sons  of  death.  The  best  is,  that  intelligence 
begun  betwixt  these  two  kingdoms  may  endure  and 
be  increased,  the  breach  whereof  I  know  will  be  at- 
tempted by  all  means  possible. 

"  The  great  desire  I  have  of  the  continuance,  mak- 
eth  me  so  earnest  to  wish  that  her  majesty  may  be  in- 
duced liv  iiood  moans  to  enter  in  the  same  conjunc- 
tion ;  wlicrrunto  if  she  cannot  by  one  way  or  other  be 
persuaded,  then  can  T  not  but  doubt  of  the  success  in 
the  end.  Although  I  do  chiefly  respect  the  common 
cause  and  public  estate,  yet  doth  my  o\vn  private  not

case  I  stand,  you  will  easily  judire  hy  -iirht  of  the  en- 
closed, which  T  pray  you,  return  to  me  with  speed.  I 
know  by  my  very  friends  in  France,  that  she  hath 
conceived  &lt;uch  an  opinion  of  my  a  flection  towards 
Kndand,  that  it  killeth  all  the  means  I  can  have  to 
enter  in  any  favor.

'*'  But  if  it  might  be  compassed  that  the  Queen's 
majesty  and  her  highness  might  be  as  dear  friends  as 
they  be  tender  cousins,  then  were  I  able  enough  to 
have  as  good  part  in  her  good  grace,  as  any  other  of 
my  quality  in  Scotland.  If  this  cannot  be  brought 
to  pass,  then  I  see  well,  at  length,  it  will  be  hard  for 
me  to  dwell  in  Rome,  and  strive  with  the  Pope.  I 
assure  you  this  whole  realm  is  in  a  miserable  case.  If 
the  Queen,  or  sovereign,  come  shortly  home,  the  dan- 
gers be  evident  and  many ;  and  if  she  shall  not  come, 
it  is  not  without  great  peril ;  yea,  what  is  not  to  be 
feared  in  a  realm  lacking  lawful  government  ?  It  is 
now  more  than  two  years  past  that  we  have  lived  in 
a  manner  without  any  regiment ;  which,  when  I  con- 
sider sometimes  with  myself,  I  marvel  from  whence 
doth  proceed  the  quietness  which  we  presently  enjoy, 
the  like  whereof,  I  think,  all  circumstances  being 
weighed,  was  never  seen  in  any  realm.  It  would 
seem  impossible  that  any  people  could  so  long  be  con- 
tained in  order,  without  fear  of  punishment  and 
strict  execution  of  the  laws;  and,  indeed,!  cannot  by 
searching,  find  out  any  probable  reason,  but  only  that 
it  has  pleased  the  goodness  of  God  to  give  this  glory 
to  his  truth  preached  among  us;  but  by  all  worldly 
judgment,  the  policy  cannot  thus  long  endure ;  so  that 
for  this  respect  her  absence  to  us  is  most  pernicious. 
Thus,  whether  she  come  or  not,  we  be  in  a  great 
strait." 

The  Catholic  party,  at  a  secret  meeting,  commis- 
sioned John  Lesley,  of  Aberdeen,  to  assure  the  Queen 
of  their  unabated  devotion  to  her  majesty.  He  inter- 
cepted her  at  Vitry  in  Champagne,  en  route  from 


.;•_'  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Khcims,  where  -lie  had  passed  a  part  of  the  winter,  to 
Joinville.  Lesley  propo&gt;ed  an  immediate  return  t«i 
Scotland ;  that  she  should  detain  her  Protestant  broth- 
er in  France,  who  had  been  dispatched  by  the  revolu- 
tionary Parliament,  until  after  her  return  to  her 
realm;  and  to  sail  to  Aberdeen,  when  a  force  of  two 
thousand  men  would  escort  her  to  her  throne.  Mary 
wisely  rejected  the  propositions  of  an  unreliable  fac- 
tion, and  sought  for  measures  of  more  general  and 
popular  character.  She  h;id  sent  four  commissioners 
to  convey  expressions  of  affection  to  her  people,  and 
promises  of  conciliation  upon  her  speedy  return. 
Parliament  responded  by  dispatching  Lord  James, 
whose  rank  and  growing  influence  with  the  reformers, 
and  strength  of  character,  fitted  him  for  the  deli- 
cate mission.  He  met  Mary  the  day  after  the  in- 
terview with  Lesley.  By  all  his  pleas  in  behalf  of 
the  congregation,  and  the  treaty  of  Edinburgh,  she 
was  unshaken  in  her  determination  to  maintain  the 
Catholic  faith,  and  dissolve  the  union  between  her 
kingdom  and  England.  She  attempted,  by  the  offer 
of  a  cardinal's  hat,  and  other  royal  gift-,  to  win  Lord 
James  to  her  views.  Rut,  steadfast  in  his  convic- 
tions, he  secured  by  his  decision,  however  distasteful 
in  itself  to  the  Queen,  her  greater  confidence — a  re- 
sult always  certain  in  the  trial  of  principle.  Mary 
continued  her  journey  to  Xancy,  into  which  she  made 
a  public  entry.  Here  her  noble  relatives  honored 
their  guest  with  a  succession  of  splendid  entertain- 
ments, and  the  excitements  of  the  chase,  and  all  the 
da//.ling  variety  of  invented  pleasures.  Wearied 
witli  this  gayety,  and  frail  in  health,  she  hastened  to 
the  fine  climate  and  solemn  entertainments  of  Join- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  63 

rille.  She  found  the  venerable  duchess  veiled  in 
crape,  the  presiding  spectre  of  her  sepulchral  man- 
sion. The  spring  had  vanished,  .and  glorious  June 
had  tinged  with  reviving  breath  her  pallid  cheeks. 
Her  dark  tresses  fell  to  her  mourning  apparel,  which 
was  snowy  white,  in  graceful  lines ;  her  beaming  eyes 
were  full  of  soul  and  gentleness;  and  her  subdued 
tones  had  an  indescribable  eloquence,  that  charmed 
to  silent  admiration  those  who  came  in  her  presence. 
She  was  admired  by  prince  and  peasant,  and  the 
throngs  gazed  at  her  when  she  appeared  in  public,  as 
if  a  celestial  visitant  were  passing.  This  strange 
beauty  and  Mary's  romantic  experience  already  cast 
into  eclipse  her  faults  of  character. 

From  Joinville  she  revisited  Rheims,  and  after  a 
brief  stay  proceeded  to  Paris.  Her  entry  into  the 
capital  was  not  attended  with  a  tumultuous  throng, 
but  with  peculiar  appropriateness.  She  was  escorted 
by  the  princes  of  the  royal  line,  and  a  company  of 
cavaliers,  who  appeared  like  a  select  train  of  devotees 
around  their  serene  and  unrivaled  goddess.  While  in 
the  brilliant  centre  of  Parisian  pleasures,  Protestant 
influences  not  unfrequently  reached  her.  During 
an  interview  with  Throckmorton,  she  freely  declared 
her  unyielding  adherence  to  Rome : 

"  To  be  plain  with  you,  the  religion  which  I  pro- 
fess I  take  to  be  the  most  acceptable  to  God;  and, 
indeed,  neither  do  I  know,  or  desire  to  know,  any 
other.  Constancy  becometh  all  people  well,  and  none 
better  than  princes,  and  such  as  have  rule  over  realms, 
and  especially  in  matters  of  religion.  I  have  been 
brought  up  in  this  religion,  and  who  might  credit  me 


64  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

in  anything,  if  I  should  show  myself  light  in  this 
eause?  Ami  though  I  be  young,  and  not  well  learned, 
vet  have  I  hoard  this  matter  oft  disputed  by  mine 
uncle,  ray  lord  cardinal,  and  I  found  therein  no  great 
reason  to  change  my  opinion. 

"  I  am  none  of  those  that  will  change  my  religion 
every  year;  and,  as  I  told  you  in  the  beginning,  I 
mean  to  constrain  none  of  my  subjects,  but  would 
wish  that  they  were  all  as  I  am ;  and,  I  trust,  they 
should  have  no  support  to  constrain  me." 

The  struggle  in  Mary's  heart  between  ambition, 
stimulated  by  the  Guises,  and  attachment  to  the 
genial  air  and  early  friends  of  France,  was  intense; 
but  it  turned  in  favor  of  a  perilous  voyage  and  a  more 
perilous  throne.  She  prepared  "  to  go  and  reign  in 
her  wild  country."  D'Oysel  was  commissioned  to  be 
her  herald,  and  requested  from  Elizabeth  a  safe  con- 
el  net  through  her  kingdom.  The  stern  sovereign  of 
the  world's  most  mighty  realm  in  the  great  elements 
of  power  promptly  refused  the  permission  until 
Mary  had  signed  the  treaty  of  Edinburgh.  This  re- 
pulse tonehed  keenly  the  sensibility  of  the  Queen  of 
Scots.  She  thus  gave  expression  to  her  emotions  in  a 
private  conference  with  the  English  ambassador: 

"  There  is  nothing  that  doth  more  grieve  me  thar 
that  I  did  so  forget  myself,  as  to  require  of  the  Queer. 
your  mistress,  that  favor  which  I  had  no  need  to  ask. 
I  needed  no  more  to  have  made  her  privy  to  my 
journey,  than  she  doth  me  of  hers.  I  may  pass  well 
enough  into  mine  own  realm,  I  think,  without  her 
passport  or  license;  for,  though  the  late  king,  your 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  65 

master,  used  all  the  impeachment  he  could,  both  to 
stay  me,  and  catch  me,  when  I  came  hither,  yet  know, 
Monsieur  1'Ambassadeur,  I  came  hither  safely ;  and  I 
may  have  as  good  means  to  help  me  home  again,  as  I 
had  to  come  hither,  if  I  would  employ  my  friends.* 
Truly,  I  was  far  from  evil-meaning  to  the  Queen, 
your  mistress,  at  this  time  to  employ  her  amity  to 
stand  me  in  stead  than  all  the  friends  I  have ;  and 
yet,  you  know,  both  in  this  realm  and  elsewhere,  I 
have  both  friends  and  allies,  and  such  as  would  be 
glad  and  willing  to  employ  both  their  forces  and  aid. 
You  have  often  told  me,  that  the  amity  between  the 
Queen,  your  mistresSj  and  me,  were  very  necessary 
and  profitable  to  us  both.  I  have  some  reason,  now, 
to  think  that  the  Queen,  your  mistress,  is  not  of  that 
mind ;  for,  I  am  sure,  if  she  were,  she  would  not  have 
received  me  thus  unkindly.  It  seems  she  makes  more 
account  of  the  amity  of  my  disobedient  subjects,  than 
of  me  their  sovereign,  who  am  her  equal  in  degree, 
though  inferior  in  wisdom  and  experience,  her  near- 
est kinswoman,  and  her  next  neighbor.  The  Queen, 
your  mistress,  doth  say  that  I  am  young,  and  do  lack 
.experience.  But  I  have  age  enough  and  experience 
to  behave  myself  towards  my  friends  and  kinsfolks 
friendly  and  uprightly,  and  I  trust  my  discretion 
shall  not  so  fail  me  that  my  passion  shall  move  me  to 
use  other  language  of  her  than  is  due  to  a  queen  and 
my  next  kinswoman." 

The  next  day,  July  21st,  she  addressed  Throckmor- 
ton,  in  the  following  very  beautiful  words,  which  re- 
veal her  sad  forebodings  of  evil : 

*  Cabala.

«;.;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  I  trust  the  wind  will  be  so  favorable  a&lt;  I  shall 
not  need  to  come  on  the  coast  of  England,  and  if  I  do, 
(lien,  Monsieur  I'Ainbassadeur,  the  Queen  your  mis- 
tress, shall  have  me  in  her  hands  to  do  her  will  of  me; 
and  if  she  be  so  hard-hearted  as  to  desire  my  end,  she 
may  then  do  her  pleasure  and  make  sacrifice  »\'  me. 
f  IVradventure  that  casualty  might  be  better  for  me 
than  to  live;  in  this  matter  God's  will  be  fulfilled." 

Catherine's  proud  spirit  was  softened  by  the  ap- 
proaching separation,  and  she  accompanied  Mary  to 
St.  Germain,  where,  thirteen  years  before,  she  first 
saw  and  embraced  the  laughing  girl,  who  now  left 
her  a  widow,  mature  in  character,  and  drinking 
deeply  of  sorrow's  cup.  From  St.  Germain,  the 
princes  of  Lorraine,  with  a  retinue  of  the  nobility, 
made  the  journey  to  Calais,  a  triumphal  procession 
in  appearance,  while  many  hearts  were  painfully 
throbbing;  and  none  more  wildly  beating  than  that  of 
the  sad  and  silent  Mary.  After  six  days'  delay,  she 
&gt;a\v  the  t\v«&gt;  galleys  and  two  vessels  of  burden,  riding 
at  anchor,  ready  for  the  royal  train.  Amid  a  throng 
of  excited  spectators,  the  youthful  Queen  folded  her 
graceful  arms  around  cherished  forms,  and  shed  tears 
like  rain,  in  that  mournful  adieu.  The  four  Marys 
were  with  her.  From  infancy  she  had  cherished  the 
strange,  superstitious  fancies  of  the  age.  Writes 
Brantome  of  the  departing  attendants:  "  Habitually 
superstitious,  in  embarking  for  the  royal  galley,  Mary 
was  appalled  by  the  mournful  spectacle  of  a  vessel 
striking  against  the  pier,  and  sinking  to  rise  no  more ; 
overwhelmed  with  the  sight  the  unhappy  queen  ex- 
claimed, '  O  God!  what  fatal  omen  is  this  for  a  voy- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  67 

age !  '  then  rushing  towards  the  stern,  she  knelt  down, 
and,  covering  her  face,  sobbed  aloud,  l  Farewell ! 
France,  farewell !  I  shall  never,  never  see  thee 


more 
a 


The  galley  having  left  port,  and  a  slight  breeze 
having  sprung  up,  we  began  to  set  sail.  .  .  .  She, 
with  both  arms  resting  on  the  poop  of  the  galley  near 
the  helm,  began  to  shed  floods  of  tears,  continually 
casting  her  beautiful  eyes  towards  the  port  and  the 
country  she  had  left,  and  uttering  these  mournful 
words :  Farewell,  France !  until  night  began  to  fall. 
She  desired  to  go  to  bed  without  taking  any  food,  and 
would  not  go  down  into  her  cabin,  so  her  bed  was 
prepared  on  the  deck.  She  commanded  the  steers- 
man, as  soon  as  it  was  day,  if  he  could  still  discern 
the  coast  of  France,  to  wake  her  and  not  fear  to  call 
her ;  in  which  fortune  favored  her ;  for,  the  wind  hav- 
ing ceased,  and  recourse  being  had  to  the  oars,  very 
little  progress  was  had  during  the  night ;  so  that  when 
day  appeared,  the  coast  of  France  was  still  visible, 
and  the  steersman  not  having  failed  to  perform  the 
commands  which  she  had  given  to  him,  she  sat  up  in 
her  bed,  and  began  again  to  look  at  France  as  long  as 
she  could,  and  then  she  redoubled  her  lamentations: 
Farewell,  France !  Farewell,  France !  I  think  I 
shall  never  see  thee  more !  " 

Such  was  the  anguish  of  the  mourning  exile,  in 
whom,  on  this  touching  occasion,  the  woman  eclipsed 
the  queen,  and  won  admiration  which  was  never  ren- 
dered to  the  severer  virtues  of  Elizabeth.  Mary  was

CHAPTEE  III. 

WHEN  the  morning  dawned  upon  the  royal  galley, 
and  the  banks  of  oars  dripped  with  the  flashing 
waters,  Mary's  tears  flowed  afresh  at  the  sight  of  a 
shadowy  outline  of  the  land  she  had  left  forever. 
She  gazed  fondly  at  the  fading  horizon,  while  the 
breeze  lifted  her  dark  tresses,  and  filled  the  drooping 
sails.  The  rowers  ceased  their  measured  strokes,  the 
vessel's  prow  cut  the  foam,  and  in  an  hour,  all  that 
remained  of  France  to  Mary  was  a  mournfully  pleas- 
ant dream,  and  the  companions  of  her  voyage.  The 
galley  swept  past  a  dangerous  shoal,  and  she  re- 
marked upon  the  peril  to  which  it  had  been  exposed, 
"  that  for  the  sake  of  her  friends,  and  for  the  common 
weal,  she  ought  to  rejoice ;  but  that  for  herself,  she 
should  have  esteemed  it  a  privilege  so  to  have  ended 
her  course." 

She  had  anticipated  the  appearance  of  English 
cruisers,  despatched  by  Elizabeth  to  intercept  her 
course ;  but  nothing  occurred  to  prevent  a  prosperous 
transit  to  the  shores  of  her  unquiet  kingdom.  On  the 
19th  of  August,  1561,  the  fleet  emerging  from  a 
heavy  fog  which  had  fallen  the  preceding  evening, 
sooner  than  was  expected  by  the  Queen's  subjects,' 
sailed  into  the  harbor  of  Leith.* 

*  Leith  is  the  port  of  Edinburgh,  and  though  the  two  cities 
have  separate  governments,  they  are  in  other  respects  practi- 
cally one.  The  route  of  the  procession  would  be  up  the  Leith

70  MARY  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS. 

The  tidings  flew,  ami  the  people  flocked  to  behold 
and  welcome  their  Quern,  whoso  charms  made  a  fav- 
orable impression  upon  those  who  dn  a«lc&lt;l  lu»r  relig- 
ious influence  upon  the  realm.  The  nobility  has- 
tened to  escort  her  to  Edinburgh,  and  tin-  ancient 
palace  of  Holyrood.  A  palfrey  was  provided  for  her, 
and  her  train  rode  upon  highland  ponies,  "  such  as 
they  were,  and  harnessed  to  nlatch."  Mary  felt 
keenly  the  contrast  between  the  pomp  and  magnifi- 
cence of  the  French  court,  and  her  humble  entrance 
into  the  ruder  dominions  of  her  inheritance.  Tears 
again  dimmed  her  vision;  and  she  saw  in  the  plain 
manners,  and  music  of  sacred  psalmody,  character- 
istic of  the  reformers,  a  source  of  perpetual  pain  to 
her  natural  and  religious  sensibilities.  The  surface- 
dressing  in  social  life  and  divine  worship,  which  had 
polished  the  daughter  of  Stuart,  unfitted  her  for  the 
stern  elements  on  which  she  must  thenceforth  lay  her 
gentle  hand. 

John  Knox,  in  a  graphic  description  of  Mary's  re- 
ception, discloses  his  own  strong  emotions  and  fearful 
apprehensions,  in  view  of  the  reign  of  a  Catholic  sov- 
ereign. 

"  The  very  face  of  the  heavens  at  the  time  of  her 
arrival  did  manifestly  speak  what  comfort  was 
brought  into  this  country  with  her:  to  wit,  sorrow, 
dolor,  darkness,  and  all  impiety ;  for  in  the  memory 
of  man  that  day  of  the  year  was  never  seen  a  more 
dolorous  face  of  the  heavens,  than  was  at  her  arrival, 

Walk  to  the  east  end  of  Princess  street,  thence  across  the 
ravine  to  the  castle,  and  thence  down  High  street  and  Canon- 
KAte  to  Holy  rood  palace.  The  entire  distance  would  be  about 

four  miles. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  71 

which  two  days  after  did  so  continue ;  for,  besides  the 
surface  wet,  and  the  corruption  of  the  air,  the  mist 
was  so  thick  and  dark  that  scarce  could  any  man 
espy  another  the  length  of  two  pair  of  butts.  The 
sun  was  not  seen  to  shine  two  days  before  nor  two 
days  after.  That  fore-warning  gave  God  to  us — but 
alas !  the  most  part  were  blind. 

"  At  the  sound  of  the  cannon  which  the  galleys 
shot,  happy  was  he  or  she  that  first  must  have  pres- 
ence of  the  Queen.  The  Protestants  were  not  the 
slowest,  and  therein  they  were  not  to  be  blamed.  Be- 
cause the  palace  of  Holyrood-House  was  not  thor- 
oughly put  in  order,  ,i or  her  coming  was  more  sudden 
than  many  looked  for,  she  remained  in  Leith  till  to- 
wards the  evening,  and  then  repaired  thither.  In  the 
way  betwixt  Leith  and  the  abbey,  met  her  the  rebels 
and  crafts  of  men  of  whom  we  spoke  of  before,  to 
wit,  those  that  had  violated  the  acts  of  the  magis- 
trates, and  had  besieged  the  provost.  But  because 
she  was  sufficiently  instructed  that  all  they  did  was 
done  in  spite  of  their  religion,  they  were  easily  par- 
doned. Fires  of  joy  were  set  forth  at  night,  and  a 
company  of  most  honest  men,  with  instruments  of 
music,  and  with  musicians,  gave  their  salutations  at 
her  chamber  window ;  the  melody,  as  she  alleged, 
liked  her  well,  and  she  willed  the  same  to  be  con-' 
tinned  some  nights  after  with  great  diligence.  The 
lords  repaired  to  her  from  all  quarters,  and  so  was 
nothing  understood  but  mirth  and  quietness,  till  the 
next  Sunday,  which  was  the  24th  of  August,  when 
that  preparation  began  to  be  made  for  that  idol,  the 
mass,  to  be  said  in  the  chapel ;  which  perceived,  the 
most  of  all  the  godly  began  to  speak  openly :  '  Shall 


72  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

that  idol  be  suffered  again  to  take  place  beneath  this 
realm  ?  It  shall  not.'  The  Lord  Lindsay  (then  but 
master)  with  the  gentlemen  of  Fife,  and  others, 
plainly  cried  in  the  close  or  yard,  '  The  idolatrous 
priests  shall  die  the  death,  according  to  God's  law.' 
One  that  carried  in  the  candle  was  evil  afraid.  But 
then  began  flesh  and  blood  to  show  itself.  There 
durst  no  Papist,  neither  yet  any  that  came  out  of 
France,  whisper,  but  the  Lord  James,  the  man  whom 
all  the  godly  did  most  reverence,  took  upon  him  to 
keep  the  chapel  door.  His  best  excuse  was,  that  he 
would  stop  all  Scottish  men  to  enter  into  the  mass. 
But  it  was  and  is  sufficiently  known,  that  the  door  was 
kept,  that  none  should  have  entry  to  trouble  the  priest, 
who,  after  the  mass  was  ended,  was  committed  to  the 
protection  of  the  Lord  John  of  Coldingham  and  L&lt;&gt;nl 

Robert  of ,  who  then  were  both  Protestants, 

and  had  communicated  at  the  table  of  the  Lord ;  be- 
twixt them  both  the  priest  was  conveyed  to  the 
chamber.  .  v,  .  And  so  the  godly  departed  with 
grief  of  heart,  and  in  the  afternoon  repaired  to  the 
abbey  in  great  companies,  and  gave  plain  signification 
that  they  could  not  abide  that  the  land  which  God  by 
his  power  had  purged  from  idolatry,  should  in  their 
eyes  be  polluted  again,  and  so  began  complaint  upon 
complaint.  The  old  duntebors  [ladies  of  the  bed- 
chamber] and  others,  that  had  long  served  in  the 
court,  hoped  to  have  no  remission  of  sins  but  by  vir- 
tue of  the  mass,  cried,  they  would  away  to  France 
without  delay — they  could  not  live  without  the  mass; 
the  same  affirmed  the  Queen's  uncle;  and  would  to 
God,  that  altogether,  with  the  mass,  they  had  taken 
good  night  of  the  realm  forever."

Knox,  whose  c&lt;  single  voice  could  put  more  life  into 
a  host  than  six  hundred  blustering  trumpets"  was  a 
terror  to  many.  In  the  sublime  persuasion  that  he 
was  commissioned  by  God  to  lead  the  "  sacramental 
host  "  against  the  corrupt  hierarchy  of  Home,  he  was 
unapproachable  by  bribery,  unmoved  by  penalties, 
and  only  annealed  for  combat  in  the  furnace  of  trial. 
The  blandishments  of  wealth,  the  sufferings  of  pen- 
ury, and  the  scoffs  of  the  great,  were  equally  unfelt  by 
him,  who  had  made,  as  an  oblation  to  the  Lord,  the 
entire  consecration  of  his  powers  to  the  one  object  of 
life — the  extermination  of  Popery  in  his  beloved  Scot- 
land. Gifted  with  a  high  order  of  intellect,  and 
courageous,  he  was  animated  by  ardent  enthusiasm, 
controlled  by  inflexibility  of  purpose,  and  a  thorough 
knowledge  of  the  human  heart.  He  swayed  men  by 
his  lofty  determination,  fearless  denunciations,  and 
evident  sincerity.  The  faults  of  such  men  as  Luther, 
Knox,  and  Cromwell  were  those  of  champions  in  a 
mighty  conflict,  who  had  not  time  to  polish  their 
weapons,  or  always  regard  the  amenities  and  rules 
of  more  peaceful  life. 

''  It  was  as  an  apostle,  or  rather  as  a  prophet,  that 
Knox  challenged  homage.  In  his  own  conceptions 
he  was  alternately  the  Elijah  rebuking  Ahab — the 
Jeremiah  denouncing  Israel — the  John  the  Baptist, 
who  could  overawe  even  the  presumptuous  Herod. 
Woe  to  the  man  who  incurred  his  wrath,  or  fell  under 
his  chastisement !  Unhappy  they  who  became  the 
object  of  his  antipathy  or  suspicion  !  In  this  predica- 
ment was  Mary  Stuart !  Whatever  prejudice  he  had 
originally  conceived  against  a  daughter  of  Guise,  was 
confirmed  and  justified  by  the  administration  of  her1

uncles.  Educated  under  their  auspic-f-,  imbued  witli 
their  principles,  he  regarded  her  as  infected  with 
their  cruelty  and  periidy — as  a  Papist,  incapable  of 
any  moral  virtue — as  an  idolater,  worse  than  an  in- 
lidel.  If  she  would  subdue  his  prejudice,  .-he  mu-t 
disclaim  her  superstitions,  renounce  the  mass,  for- 
sake the  idol — on  no  other  condition  could  he  be  JMT 
suaded  that  she  was  entitled  to  esteem  and  confi- 
dence." 

lie  regarded  the  mass  the  coronation  of  the  "  man 
of  sin  "  upon  Puritan  soil ;  and  he  therefore  said,  that 
"  one  mass  was  more  fearful  to  him  than  if  ten  thou- 
sand armed  enemies  were  landed  in  every  part  of  the 
realm."  And  soon  after  the  first  Sabbath  of  the  royal 
retinue  in  Ilolyrood,  he  thus  unbosomed  his  heart  in 
a  letter  to  Calvin  at  Geneva : 

"  The  arrival  of  the  Queen  has  disturbed  the  tran- 
quillity of  our  affairs.  She  had  scarcely  been  back 
three  days,  before  the  idol  of  the  mass  was  again  set 
up.  Some  prudent  men  of  great  authority  endeav- 
ored to  prevent  it,  saying  that  their  purified  con- 
science could  not  suffer  that  that  land  should  again 
be  contaminated,  which  the  Lord,  by  the  efficacy  of 
his  word,  had  purged  from  idolatry.  But  as  the 
major  part  of  those  who  adhere  to  our  faith  thought 
differently,  impiety  gained  the  victory,  and  is  now 
acquiring  fn&gt;h  strength.  Those  who  favored  it  give 
as  a  reason  for  their  indulgence,  that  all  the  ministers 
of  the  Lord  are  of  opinion,  and  that  you  yourself  de- 
clare, that  it  is  not  lawful  for  us  to  prevent  the  Queen 
from  practising  her  religion.  Although  I  contradict 
this  rumor,  which  apj»ears  to  me  very  false,  it  has 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  75 

taken  such  deep  root  in  men's  hearts,  that  it  will  be 
impossible  for  me  to  dislodge  it,  unless  I  learn  from 
you  whether  the  question  has  been  actually  submitted 
to  your  Church,  and  what  was  the  answer  of  the 
brethren.  I  am  always  troubling  you  with  such  in- 
quiries, but  I  have  no  one  else  into  whose  bosom  I 
can  pour  my  cares.  I  confess  candidly,  my  father, 
that  I  have  never  until  now  felt  how  painful  and  diffi- 
cult it  is  to  combat  hypocrisy  when  concealed  under 
the  mask  of  piety.  I  have  never  feared  open  ene- 
mies so  greatly,  but  that,  in  the  midst  of  my  tribula- 
tions, I  have  hoped  to  gain  the  victory." 

It  was  no  pleasant  pastime  to  confront  such  a 
leader  of  the  Protestant  party — a  party  too  powerful 
to  crush,  and  not  susceptible  to  the  flatteries  or  im- 
posing forms  of  papal  worship. 

Yet  Mary  hoped  to  conciliate  her  restive  subjects 
by  her  smiles,  and  a  concession  which  she  thought 
might  reconcile  them  to  her  private  observance  of  her 
own  religious  forms.  She  issued  a  proclamation,  that 
no  alteration  should  be  made  in  the  established  re- 
ligion, "  and  that  any  act,  whether  public  or  private, 
which  tended  to  change  its  form,  should  be  punished 
with  death."  She  also  exchanged  her  apparel  of  white 
crape,  which  had  won  in  France  the  appellation  of 
''  Reine  Blanche  "  —White  Queen — for  the  mourn- 
ing of  her  people — a  sable  dress.  This  attire  en- 
hanced her  beauty,  like  the  dark  back-ground  to  a 
picture  of  celestial  penciling. 

On  the  second  of  September  she  made  her  public 
entry  into  Edinburgh.  Her  train  issued  from  the 
castle  in  the  afternoon,  and  moved  towards  "  Scotia's 


76  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

ancient  seat,"  under  a  canopy  of  violet  velvet,  and  fol- 
lowed by  the  nubility.  She  was  greeted  with  tho 
pageant  of  a  child,  six  years  of  age,  issuing  from  a 
cloud,  as  if  descending  from  Heaven,  who,  after  re- 
poating  a  poem,  presented  her  with  the  keys  of  Edin- 
burgh, a  Bible,  and  Book  of  Psalms. 

Contrasted  with  these  signals  of  loyalty,  were 
warnings  in  various  symbols  along  her  way.  The  fate 
of  Korah,  and  of  Dathan  and  Abirain,  were  set  forth, 
with  other  significant  exhibitions  of  indignation 
against  the  rites  of  idolatrous  Rome.  After  these 
scenes  had  transpired,  Mary  desired  to  have  an  inter- 
view with  Knox,  whose  presence  she  was  willing  to 
endure  for  the  sake  of  her  kingdom.  The  following 
is  the  account  given  by  the  reformer  himself,  of  his 
visit  to  the  Queen,  whom  he  found  alone  with  her 
brother,  Lord  James,  and  who  at  the  outset  re- 
proached him  for  his  work  against  Female  Sov- 
ereigns. To  this  he  replied  : 

"  Learned  men,  in  all  ages,  have  had  their  judg- 
ments free,  and  most  commonly  disagreeing  from  the 
common  judgment  of  the  world ;  such  also  have  they 
published  both  with  pen  and  tongue,  notwithstanding 
they  themselves  have  lived  in  the  common  society 
with  others,  and  have  borne  patiently  with  the  errors 
suid  imperfection*  which  they  could  not  amend. 
}  Plato,  the  philosopher,  wrote  his  book  of  the  Com- 
monwealth, in  the  which  he  condemns  many  things 
that  were  maintained  in  the  world,  and  required 
many  things  to  have  been  reformed;  and  yet,  not- 
withstanding, he  lived  under  such  politics  as  then 
were  universally  received,  without  further  troubling 
any  state ;  even  so,  madam,  am  I  content  to  do,  in  up- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  f  7 

Tightness  of  heart,  and  with  the  testimony  of  a  good 
conscience  I  have  communicated  my  judgment  to  the 
world.  If  the  realm  find  no  inconvenience  in  the  re- 
gimen of  a  woman,  that  which  they  approve  shall  I 
not  farther  disallow  them  within  my  own  breast,  but 
shall  be  as  well  content,  and  shall  live  under  your 
majesty,  as  Paul  was  to  live  under  the  Roman  Em- 
peror ;  and  my  hope  is,  that  so  long  as  you  defile  not 
your  hands  with  the  blood  of  the  saints  of  God,  that 
neither  I  nor  that  book  shall  either  hurt  yon  or  your 
authority ;  for  in  very  deed,  madam,  that  book  was 
written  most  especially  against  wicked  Mary  *  of 
England." 

"  But  you  speak  of  women  in  general  ?  " 

"  Most  true  it  is,  madam ;  and  yet  plainly  appear- 
eth  to  me  that  wisdom  should  persuade  your  majesty 
never  to  raise  trouble  for  that  which  this  day  hath  not 
troubled  your  majesty,  neither  in  person  nor  in 
anxiety.  For  of  late  years,  many  things  which  before 
were  holden  stable,  have  been  called  in  doubt ;  yea, 
they  have  been  plainly  impugned:  but  yet,  madam, 
I  am  assured  that  neither  Protestant  nor  Papist  shall 
be  able  to  prove  that  any  such  question  was  at  any 
time  moved  in  public  or  in  private.  Even,  madam, 
if  I  had  intended  to  trouble  your  estate,  because  you 
are  a  woman,  I  might  have  chosen  a  time  more  con- 
venient for  that  purpose  than  I  could  do  now,  when 
your  own  presence  is  within  the  realm." 

Knox  repelled  the  charges  of  sedition  and  necro- 
mancy, which  seemed  to  satisfy  the  Queen,  who  yet 
complained  of  the  seditious  influence  of  his  reasoning. 

"  You  have  brought  the  people  to  receive  another

religion  than  their  prince--  r;m  allow — and  how  can 
tli;ii  doctrine  lx&gt;  of  (1...1.  seeing  that  God  commandeth 
Milijocts  to  obey  their  prince  {  " 

"  Madam,  as  right  religion  took  neither  original 
nor  integrity  from  worldly  princes,  but  from  the  eter- 
nal God  alone,  so  are  not  subjects  bound  to  frame 
their  religion  according  to  the  appetite  of  their 
princes.  If  all  the  seed  of  Abraham  should  have  been 
of  the  religion  of  Pharaoh,  what  religion  should  there 
have  been  in  the  world  ?  Or  if  all  men  in  the  days  of 
the  Roman  Emperors  should  have  been  of  the  religion 
of  the  Roman  Emperors,  what  religion  should  have 
been  on  the  face  of  the  earth  ?  Daniel  and  his  fel- 
lows were  subject  to  ^Nebuchadnezzar  and  unto  Da- 
rius, and  yet  they  would  not  be  of  their  religion." 

Mary,  in  reply,  urged  that  none  of  the  worthies 
mentioned  took  arms  against  the  king.  Knox  con- 
tinued : 

"  Yet,  madam,  ye  cannot  deny  but  that  they  re- 
sisted ;  for  those  that  obey  not  the  commandments 
given,  in  some  sort  resist." 

"  But  yet,"  reiterated  the  Queen,  "  they  resisted 
not  by  the  sword." 

"'  God,  madam,  had  not  given  them  the  power  and 
the  means." 

"Think  you  that  subjects,  having  the  power,  may 
n-i-t  their  prim-i  -  '.  " 

"  If  prince-  di  i  exceed  their  bounds,  madam,  or  do 
against  that  wherefore  they  should  be  obeyed,  them 
i&gt;  no  doubt  they  may  lie  resisted,  oven  by  power;  for 
there  is  neither  greater  honor  n&lt;&gt;r  greater  obedience  to 
be  given  to  kings  and  princes  than  to  father  or 
mother;  but  so  it  is,  that  the  father  may  be  stricken 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  79 

with  a  phrenzy,  in  the  whioh  he  will  slay  his  own 
children;  now,  madam,  if  the  children  arise,  appre- 
hend the  father,  take  the  sword  or  other  weapon  from 
him,  and  finally  bind  his  hands,  and  keep  him  in 
prison  till  his  phrenzy  be  overpast,  think  ye,  madam, 
that  the  children  do  any  wrong  ?  " 

The  mention  of  a  prison  awakened  Mary's  fears 
with  so  visible  effect,  that  afterwards  it  was  related 
as  evidence  of  supernatural  inspiration  in  this  stern 
reprover  of  monarchs. 

When  Knox  alluded  to  the  protection  sovereigns 
might  give  to  the  church  of  Christ,  she  replied  in  an- 
ger— u  Yes,  this  is  indeed  true,  but  yours  is  not  the 
church  that  I  will  nourish.  I  will  defend  the  church 
of  Rome,  for  I  think  it  the  true  church  of  God."  He 
replied  indignantly,  that  her  will  was  not  reason,  and 
her  opinion  could  not  change  that  harlot  into  the  im- 
maculate spouse  of  Christ.  He  farther  offered  to 
prove  that  the  Catholic  church  was  more  degenerate 
and  corrupt  than  the  Jewish  nation,  when  they  cru- 
cified Christ.  But  Mary  closed  the  exciting  debate, 
and  bade  him  farewell.  He  left  her  presence,  pray- 
ing God  "  she  might  be  as  blessed  in  the  common- 
wealth of  Scotland,  as  ever  Deborah  was  in  the  com- 
monwealth of  Israel." 

The  zeal  of  the  unyielding  Covenanter  displeased 
the  more  politic  leaders  of  the  Protestant  party.  In 
a  letter  to  Cecil,  Lethington  wrote : 

"  You  know  the  vehemency  of  Mr.  Knox's  spirit, 
which  cannot  be  bridled,  and  yet  doth  sometimes  ut- 
ter such  sentences  as  cannot  easily  be  digested  by  a 
weak  stomach.  I  could  wish  he  would  deal  with  her 


80  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

more  gently,  being  a  young  princess  unpersuaded. 
For  this  I  am  accounted  too  politic,  Imt  surely  in  her 
comporting  with  him  she  doth  declare  a  wisdom  far 
eding  her  age.  &lt;i"d  grant  her  the  assistance  of 
his  Spirit!" 

The  compromise  with  Protestantism  which  pre- 
vailed, secured  to  the  Queen  the  enjoyment  of  her 
own  faith,  conferred  authority  upon  a  mixed  council 
and  retaining  two-thirds  of  the  revenues  for  tin- 
Catholics  and  nohility,  devoted  one-third  to  the  u-e 
of  the  new  church.  l&gt;ut  other  troubles  remained  un- 
touched. There  were  the  revolted  and  factious  nobles 
to  subdue;  the  probable  collision  with  Klixabeth  ;  and, 
finally,  the  question  of  her  marriage, — for  to  accept 
a  foreign  prince  would  endanger  her  crown,  and  to 
marry  a  subject  would  sow  additional  discords  in  her 
kingdom. 

Lord  James  Stuart  was  a  master  spirit  among  her 
admirers,  and  acted  wisely,  though  a  decided  Protes- 
tant. The  Queen  made  him  Earl  of  Mar  upon  his 
marriage  with  the  daughter  of  the  Karl  Marshal,  and 
invested  him  with  power  to  subdue  the  relx'ls  on  the 
frontier,  lie  entered  upon  the  difficult  command, 
and  with  the  heroic  energy  of  his  decided  character, 
soon  finished  the  work.  His  elevation  increased  the 
di.-content  of  a  jealous  .aristocracy ;  and  in  a  fit  of 
insanity,  the  Karl  of  Arran  revealed  a  plot,  which  was 
di. -dosed  to  him  by  Earl  of  Both  well  and  the  Abln.t 
of  Kilu  inning,  for  invading  the  palace,  making  Mary 
a  prisoner,  and  killing  Lord  James,  to  secure  the  rein- 
of  government.  The  conspiracy  was  of  course 
crushed,  and  its  authors  were  arrested. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  81 

Mary,  meanwhile,  had  given  to  the  sombre  apart- 
ments of  Holyrood,  the  luxury  and  much  of  the  ele- 
gance of  a  French  court.  She  embellished  the  walls 
with  tapestry,  adorned  her  person  with  jewels,  and 
found  amusement  in  directing,  by  her  taste,  the  im- 
provements in  landscape  gardening.  Of  the  four 
Marys  who  had  been  her  companions  from  girlhood 
the  amiable  Fleming  marrie4  Maitland,  Mary  Liv- 
ingston, William,  eldest  son'  of  Lord  Temple,  and 
Mary  Beaton,  though  once  engaged,  and  Mary  Sea- 
ton,  remained  unmarried.  The  following  passages 
from  Sir  Thomas  Randolph,  the  English  Ambassa- 
dor, afford  interesting  glimpses  of  life  at  Holyrood. 
The  Queen,  after  a  sitting  of  her  council,  was  walk- 
ing with  him  in  the  garden,  when  she  inquired, — 
"  How  like  you  this  country — you  have  been  in  it  a 
good  space,  and  know  it  well  enough  ?  "  "  My  answer 
was,  that  the  country  was  good,  and  the  polity  might 
be  made  much  better."  "  The  absence  of  a  prince 
hath  caused  it  to  be  worse — but  yet,  is  it  not  like  unto 
England  ?  "  I  answered,  "  That  there  were  many  in 
the  world,  worse  than  her  grace's  that  were  thought 
right  good,  but  I  judged  few  better  than  England; 
which,  I  trusted,  that  some  time  after,  her  grace 
should  witness."  "  I  would  be  content  therewith  if  my 
sister,  your  mistress,  so  liked."  I  said,  "  That  it  was 
the  thing  that  many  of  her  grace's  subjects  did  de- 
sire, and,  as  I  judged,  would  also  content  my  mis-/ 
tress." 

Randolph  adds :  "  I  receive  of  her  grace,  at  all 

times,  very  good  words.    I  am  borne  in  hand  by  such 

as  are  nearest  about  her,  as  the  Lord  James  and  the 

Laird  of  Lethington :  that  they  are  meant  as  they  are

spoken  of,  I  see  them  above  all  others  in  credit,  and 
find  in  them  no  alteration  :  though  there  be  that  com- 
plain, they  yield  too  much  to  her  appetite,  which  I 
see  not.  The  Lord  James  denleth  according  to  his 

nature,  rudely,  homely,  and  bluntly;  the  Laird  of 
Lethington  more  delicately  and  fiudy.  yet  nothing 

rving  from  the  other  in  mind  and  effect.  SI: 
patient  to  hear,  and  b&amp;iretb  much.  The  Karl  Maris- 
chal  is  wary,  but  spoaketh  sometimes  to  good  pur- 
pose;— his  daughter  is  lately  coin&lt;&gt;  to  tin-  to\vu: — 
we  look  shortly  for  what  shall  become  of  the  long  love 
l&gt;etwixt  the  Lord  James  aud  that  lady.  The  Lord 
John  of  Coldingham  hath  not  least  favor,  with  his 
leaping  and  dancing: — ho  is  like  to  marry  the  Lord 
BothwelPs  sister.  The  Lord  Rol&gt;ert  consumeth  with 
love  of  the  Earl  Cassil's  sister; — the  Earl  Both  well 
hath  given  unto  him  old  lands  of  his  father,  in  Teviot- 
dale,  and  the  A 1  they  of  Melross.  The  duke's  grace* 
is  come  to  Kinneil,  and  proposes  not  to  come  near  to 
the  court,  except  that  he  be  sent  for.  I  hear  of  noth- 
ing that  is  proposed  against  him:  it  is  thought  that 
he  may  be  well  enough  spared.  My  Lord  Arran 
pn&gt;  pox 'th  not  to  be  at  court  so  long  as  the  mass  re- 
maiueth  :  there  come  few  to  it,  but  herself,  her  uncle 
and  train.  Three  causes,  I  jx'rceive  there  are,  that 
make  my  Lord  of  Arrau  to  absent  himself;  the  one 
is  the  mass;  the  other,  the  presence  of  his  enemy;  the 
third,  lack  wherewith  to  maintain  a  court.  By  the 
first,  he  maintains  his  credit  with  the  precise  Protes- 
tants: the  other  argues  less  courage  in  him  than  many 
men  thought,  that  his  enemy  is  yet  alive  to  have  that 
place  which  he  is  unworthy  of;  the  third  manifests

the  beastliness  of  his  father,  that  more  than  money, 
hath  neither  faith  nor  God.  The  lords  now  begin  to 
return  to  the  court,  the  bishops  flock  apace ;  the  Metro- 
politan of  St.  Andrews  arrived  here  on  Monday  last, 
with  eighty  horses  in  train,  and  to  be  seen  he  rode 
half-a-mile  out  of  his  way  through  the  High-street  of 
Edinburgh ; — we  know  not  yet  what  mischief  he  and 
his  associates  come  for:  he  had  with  him  only  two 
Hamiltons." 

Though  the  Earl  of  Mar  had  paralyzed  the  strength 
of  the  Hamiltons  in  the  northern  districts  of  Scot- 
land, the  Gordons  were  rebellious  in  the  West.  Earl 
of  Huntly  had  planned  a  conspiracy  against  the  life 
of  Lethington  and  Earl  of  Mar.  His  son,  John  Gor- 
don, had  aspired  to  Mary's  hand.  But  in  consequence 
of  a  duel  with  Lord  Ogilvy,  he  was  summoned  to  re- 
pair to  Stirling  Castle.  The  mandate  of  his  Sover- 
eign he  disregarded,  and  appeared  in  open  revolt  at 
the  head  of  a  thousand  horsemen.  His  father,  Earl 
of  Huntly,  having  fortified  tKe  castles,  took  up  his 
quarters  in  the  mountains,  to  "await  the  approach  of 
Mary  Stuart,  who  was  making  a  tour  to  the  northern 
frontier.  She  marched  at  the  head  of  a  small  army, 
commanded  by  Earl  of  Mar.  Reaching  the  Castle  of 
Inverness,  which  was  shut  against  her,  she  ordered 
an  attack,  followed  by  surrender,  and  the  execution 
of  the  captain  who  held  the  stronghold. 

She  displayed  great  heroism  in  this  campaign,  en- 
during exposure  and  wearisome  marches,  fording  riv- 
ers, crossing  highlands,  and  encamping  on  the  deso- 
late heath ;  regretting  "  that  she  was  not  a  man,  to 
know  what  life  it  was  to  lie  all  night  in  the  fields,  or 
to  walk  upon  the  causeway,  with  a  jack  and  knapsack,

a  Glasgow  buckler  and  a  broadsword."  After  this 
expedition,  she  gave  to  her  brother  the  earldom  of 
Murray,  which  resulted  in  open  war  with  the  Gor- 
dons. The  final  issue  was,  the  conquest  &lt;»f  the  llani- 
iltons  and  Gordons,  the  farther  triumph  of  Protes- 
tantism, and  augmenting  the  power  of  Murray,  who 
was  virtually  supreme,  and  ruled  with  no  less  energy 
than  prudence. 

Knox  was,  after  all,  the  power  behind  the  throne, 
whom  Murray  and  the  Queen  regarded  as  a  Titan 
among  reformers.  He  wrote  of  her  appearance  in 
Parliament: 

"  Three  sundry  days  the  Queen  rode  to  the  Toll- 
booth  ;  the  first  day  she  made  a  painted  oration,  and 
there  might  have  been  heard  amongst  her  flatterers, 
.*  Vox  Diance,  the  voice  of  a  goddess!  (for  it  could  not 
be  Dei,)  *  and  not  of  a  woman ! — God  save  that  sweet 
face!  Was  there  ever  orator  spoke  so  properly  and 
so  sweetly!'  All  things,"  he  adds,  "  misliked  the 
preachers.  They  spake  boldly  against  the  super- 
fluity of  their  clothes,  and  against  the  rest  of  their 
vanity,  which  they  affirmed  should  provoke  God's 
wrath  not  only  against  these  foolish  women,  but 
against  the  whole  realm.  Articles  wore  presented  for 
orders  to  be  taken  of  apparel,  and  for  reformation  of 
other  enormities,  but  all  was  winked  at." 

Mary's  marriage  was  a  subject  of  much  speculation 
and  prophecy.  Knox  heard  that  she  had  rejected  \ 
the  kiiii:  of  Sweden,  and  was  in  danger  of  an  Austrian 
or  Spanish  alliance,  and  openly  denounced  her  course. 
He  was  again  summoned  into  her  pre&gt;en«-e;  and,  ac- 
*  Knox  had  in  mind  Herod  Agrippa  I.  See  Acts  xii :  21 .

companied  by  John  Erskine,  of  Dun,  whose  temper 
and  aspect  would  remind  one  in  contrast  with  Knox, 
of  Melancthon  by  Luther's  side,  he  promptly  obeyed 
the  royal  mandate.  The  record  of  the  interview,  as 
given  by  himself,  is  an  interesting  exhibition  of  his 
own  and  Mary's  peculiar  qualities.  He  affirms,  that 
she  immediately  began  to  weep,  and  exclaim: 

"  That  never  prince  was  used  as  she  was ;  '  I  have,' 
said  she,  l  borne  with  you  in  all  your  rigorous  man- 
ner of  speaking,  both  against  myself,  and  against  my 
uncles ;  yea,  I  have  sought  your  favour  by  all  possible 
meanes;  I  offered  unto  you  presence  and  audience 
whensoever  it  pleased  you  to  admonish  mee ;  and  yet 
I  cannot  be  quit  of  you ;  I  vow  to  God  I  shall  be  once 
revenged ; '  and  with  these  words  scarce  could  Mar- 
nocke,  one  of  her  pages,  get  handkerchiefs  to  hold  her 
eyes  dry;  for  the  tears  and  the  howling,  besides  wo- 
manly weeping,  stayed  her  speech. 

"  The  said  John  did  patiently  abide  all  this  fume, 
and  at  opportunity  answered ;  t  True  it  is,  madame, 
your  majesty  and  I  have  beene  at  diverse  controver- 
sies, into  the  which  I  never  perceived  your  majesty 
to  be  offended  at  me ;  but  when  it  shall  please  God  to 
deliver  you  from  that  bondage  of  darknesse  and  er- 
rour  wherein  ye  have  been  nourished  for  the  lack  of 
true  doctrine,  your  majesty  will  finde  the  liberty  of 
my  tongue  nothing  offensive ;  without  the  preaching 
place,  I  thinke  few  have  occasion  to  be  offended  at 
me;  and  there  I  am  not  master  myselfe,  but  must 
obey  Him  who  commands  me  to  speak  plaine,  and  to 
flatter  no  flesh  upon  the  face  of  the  earth/ 

" '  But  what  have  you  to  do/  said  she,  '  with  my 
marriage  ? .' 


86  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  '  If  it  please  your  majesty  patiently  to  hear  me, 
I  shall  shew  the  truth  in  plain  words.  I  grant  your 
majesty  offered  unto  race  more  than  ever  I  required, 
but  my  answer  was  then  as  it  is  now,  that  God  hath 
not  sent  me  to  awaite  upon  the  courts  of  princes,  or 
upon  the  chamber  of  ladies,  but  I  am  sent  to  preach 
the  Evangell  of  Jesus  Christ  to  such  as  please  to  hear ; 
it  hath  two  points,  repentance  and  faith:  Now,  in 
preaching  repentance,  of  necessity  it  is  that  the  sinnes 
of  men  be  noted,  that  they  may  know  wherein  they 
offend.  But  so  it  is,  that  most  part  of  your  nobilitie 
are  so  much  addicted  to  your  affections,  that  neither 
God's  word,  nor  yet  their  commonwealth,  are  rightly 
regarded ;  and,  therefore,  it  becometh  me  to  speak 
that  they  may  know  their  duty.' 

*• '  What  have  you  to  do  with  my  marriage,  or  what 
are  you  within  the  commonwealth  ? 9 

"  *  A  subject,  borne  within  the  same,  madame ;  and 
albeit  I  bee  neither  carlo,  lord,  nor  baron,  within  it, 
yet  hath  God  made  me  (how  abject  that  ever  I  bee  in 
your  eyes,)  a  profitable  and  a  useful  member  within 
the  same:  yea,  madame,  to  me  it  appertaineth  no  less 
to  forewarn  of  such  things  as  may  hurt  it,  if  I  foresee 
them,  than  it  doeth  to  any  one  of  the  nobility;  for 
both  my  vocation  and  office  craveth  plainnesse  of  me : 
and  therefore,  madame,  to  yourselfe  I  say  that  which 
I  spake  in  publike:  Whensoever  the  nobility  of  this 
realme  shall  be  content,  and  consent  that  you  be  sub- 
ject to  an  unlawful  husband,  they  doe  as  much  as  in 
them  licth  to  renounce  Christ,  to  banish  the  truth,  to 
betray  the  freedom  of  this  realme,  and  perchance 
shall,  in  the  end,  doe  small  comfort  to  yourselfe.' 

"  At  these  words,  howling  was  heard,  and  teares 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  87 

might  have  been  scene  in  greater  abundance  than  the 
matter  required.  John  Erskine,  of  Dun,  a  man  of 
meeke  and  gentle  spirit,  stood  beside,  and  did  what 
he  could  to  mitigate  the  anger,  and  gave  unto  her 
many  pleasant  words  of  her  beauty,  of  her  excellency, 
and  how  that  all  the  princes  in  Europe  would  be  glad 
to  seek  her  favours  &gt;  but  all  that  was  to  cast  oil  into 
the  flaming  fire. 

"  !No  such  mitigation,  however,  was  offered  by 
Knox,  who  stood  still,  without  any  alteration  of  coun- 
tenance, and  in  the  end  said,  '  Madam,  in  God's  pres- 
ence I  speak,  I  never  delighted  in  the  weeping  of  any 
of  God's  creatures,  yea,  I  can  scarcely  well  abide  the 
teares  of  mine  own  boys,  when  mine  own  hands  cor- 
rect them ;  much  less  can  I  rejoice  in  your  majestie's 
weeping ;  but  seeing  I  have  offered  unto  you  no  just 
occasion  to  be  offended,  but  have  spoken  the  truth,  as 
my  vocation  craves  of  me:  I  must  sustaine  your 
majestie's  teares  rather  than  I  dare  hurt  my  con- 
science, or  betray  the  commonwealth  by  silence.' 
Herewith  was  the  Queen  more  offended,  and  com- 
manded the  said  John  to  passe  forth  of  the  cabinet, 
and  to  abide  further  of  her  pleasure  in  the  chamber. 

"  But  in  that  chamber  where  he  stood  as  one  whom 
men  had  never  scene  (except  that  the  Lord  Ochiltree 
bare  him  company,)  the  confidence  of  Knox  did  not 
forsake  him;  and,  therefore,  began  he  to  make  dis- 
course with  the  ladies,  who  were  there  sitting  in  all 
their  gorgeous  apparel ;  which,  when  he  espied,  he 
merrily  said,  '  Fair  ladies,  how  pleasant  were  this 
life  of  yours,  if  it  should  ever  abide !  and  then  in  the 
end  that  wee  might  passe  to  Heaven  with  this  geare : 
but  fie  upon  that  knave,  Death,  that  will  come  whether

we  will  or  not ;  and  when  ho  hath  laid  on  the  arrest, 
then  foule  wormea  will  bee  busie  with  this  flesh,  be  it 
never  so  faire  and  so  tender;  and  the  silly  soule,  I 
feare,  shall  be  so  feeble,  that  it  can  neither  carry  with 
it  gold,  garnishing,  targeting,  pearl,  nor  precious 
stones.7 ' 

Farther  efforts  at  intimidation  were  made  by  tho 
Queen  in  vain,  and  Knox  left  her  in  triumph.  Soon 
after  he  was  married  to  the  daughter  of  Lord  Ochil- 
tree,  an  interesting  young  lady,  twenty  years  of  age ; 
resembling,  in  her  companionship  with  the  Reformer, 
a  bell-flower  clinging  to  the  side  of  an  immovable 
rock. 

The  question  of  Mary's  marriage  also  involved  the 
English  interest.  She  wished  to  be  declared  the  pre- 
sumptive heiress  of  Elizabeth,  and  on  that  condition 
would  submit  to  her  the  choice  of  a  husband.  For 
three  years,  it  was  a  matter  of  correspondence  be- 
tween the  sovereigns,  and  their  ambassadors  endeav- 
ored to  make  the  negotiations  friendly  and  successful. 
The  English  hoped  to  secure  a  Protestant  alliance, 
and  with  it  Mary's  conversion  from  Popery. 

But  while  she  firmly  refused  to  sign  the  treaty  of 
Edinburgh,*  a  step  urged  by  her  rival,  she  as  little 

*  The  negotiations,  managed  on  the  part  of  Cecil  with  much 
II,  were  completed  July  6,  1560.  The  articles  conceded,  on 

e  part  of  the  French  commissioners,  the  renunciation  of  all 
retensions  to  the  crown  of  England,  which  had  been  assumed 
by  the  king  and  queen  of  France,  and  a  complete  recognition 
of  the  liberty  of  conscience,  for  which  the  reformers  had 
taken  Up  arms ;  no  express  recognition  of  the  reformed  wor- 
ship was  stipulated,  and  the  bishops  'and  other  churchmen 
who  had  received  injuries  were  to  be  redressed.  For  nearly 
a  year  Mary  refused  to  ratify  this  treaty.  It  was  then  taken 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  89 

thought  of  renouncing,  under  any  circumstances,  her 
allegiance  to  Rome.  The  Queen  of  England  was  as 
deeply  hostile  to  nominating  Mary  her  successor. 
While  pursuing  these  different  ends,  to  bring  the  con- 
flicting claims  to  a  favorable  termination,  a  personal 
meeting  was  proposed.  When,  therefore,  Lethington 
returned  to  Edinburgh,  with  a  kind  letter  from  Eliza- 
beth, and  her  portrait,  offering  an  interview,  in  the 
hope  of  cultivating,  permanently,  harmony  between 
the  two  realms,  Mary  manifested  great  joy.  With 
her  natural  vivacity  and  hopefulness,  she  said  to  Ran- 
dolph, "  I  trust  by  that  time  that  we  have  spoken  to- 
gether, our  hearts  will  be  so  eased,  that  the  greatest 
grief  that  ever  after  shall  be  between  us,  will  be  when 
we  shall  take  leave,  the  one  of  the  other.  And  let 
God  be  my  witness,  I  honor  her  in  my  heart,  and  love 
her  as  my  dear  and  natural  sister." 

This  pledge  from  Elizabeth  was  not  fulfilled.  She 
was  involved  in  the  continental  wars,  assisting  the 
Huguenots,  which  she  pleaded  in  her  message  to 
Mary,  as  a  sufficient  reason  for  postponing  the  inter- 
view till  the  following  summer.  The  disappointment 
of  the  Queen  of  Scots  upon  hearing  the  announcement 
from  Sir  Henry  Sidney,  was  significant  of  future  at- 
tempts of  a  similar  kind.  Nor  could  it  well  be,  that 
the  ambitious  sovereigns,  so  dissimilar  in  the  whole 
outline  of  character,  should  confide  in  each  other. 
"  Both  training  and  nature  conspired  to  make  these 
women  opposites.  Elizabeth's  youth  had  been  one  of 
fear,  and  caution,  and  restraints,  and  her  deportment 

up  by  the  estate  of  the  kingdom  who  assembled,  at  the  time 
stipulated,  by  the  treaty,  without  having  received  any  com- 
mission from  the  queen. — Condensed  from  Knight

always  bore  traces  of  this  hard  discipline,  in  its  stiff- 
ness and  want  of  grace.  Mary's  had  been  tenderly 
fostered ;  she  was  admired  and  even  beloved,  as  far  as 
the  denizens  of  that  court  had  hearts  to  love.  Her 
'  charming  nature  '  could  expand  in  all  the  sunshine 
of  general  approval — there  were  no  cold  checks  shut- 
ting her  up  within  herself;  her  manner  was,  there- 
fore, open,  frank,  engaging,  and  cordial — how  should 
a  prosperous,  joyous  beauty's  ever  be  otherwise  ?  But 
it  was  only  an  accomplishment,  formed  not  by  the 
heart  so  much  as  by  external  circumstances.  She  had 
no  need  in  her  youth  for  habitual  circumspection,  and 
her  general  demeanor  was  the  gainer  by  it." 

During  the  winter  of  1563,  Mary  dispatched  Leth- 
ington  to  the  court  of  Elizabeth,  to  gain  her  favor 
towards  the  princes  of  Lorraine,  and  assert  the  right 
of  succession,  if  the  question  should  be  agitated. 
Mary's  temperament,  and  unfortunate  education, 
were  never  more  conspicuous  than  at  this  period, 
while  vital  questions  to  herself  and  her  kingdom  were 
pending.  She  abandoned  herself  to  all  the  amuse- 
ments and  pleasures  of  a  gay  court.  Music,  dancing, 
falconry,  poesy,  and  gallantries  were  the  variety  of 
life  in  the  palace  of  Holyrood.  In  vain  Knox  mounted 
his  pulpit  to  denounce  the  midnight  festivities  of  roy- 
alty. He  complained,  4&lt;  that  princes  are  more  exer- 
cised in  fiddling  and  flinging,  than  in  reading  or  hear- 
ing of  God's  most  blessed  word.  Fiddlers  and  flat- 
terers who  commonly  corrupt  the  youth,  are  more 
previous  in  their  eyes  than  men  of  wisdom  and  grav- 
ity, who,  by  wholesome  admonition  might  beat  down 
in  them  some  part  of  the  vanity  and  pride  whereunto 
all  are  born,  but  in  princes  take  deep  root  and  strength 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  91 

by  wicked  education."  Mary's  dissipation,  naturally 
enough,  engaged  her  in  unhappy  attentions  from  em- 
boldened admirers. 

A  Captain  Hepburn  was  so  familiar  and  indelicate 
in  his  advances,  that  he  escaped  punishment  only  by 
flight.  Chastelard,  a  poet  and  musician  from  Dau- 
phiny,  became  a  lover.  He  addressed  poems  to  the 
beautiful  Queen,  to  which,  by  proxy  or  otherwise,  she 
replied ;  she  allowed  private  visits  in  her  cabinet 
more  frequently  than  to  any  of  her  nobility;  and  by 
other  expressions  of  peculiar  regard,  intoxicated  him 
with  passion.  One  evening  he  ventured  to  conceal 
himself  under  her  bed,  and  upon  his  discovery,  Mary 
ordered  him  to  leave  the  court  forever.  Instead  of  com- 
pliance with  the  command,  the  infatuated  lover  fol- 
lowed her  into  Fife,  whither  she  had  gone  on  a  tour  to 
the  North,  and  again  concealed  himself  in  her  apart- 
ment. In  a  glow  of  indignation,  she  ordered  Murray 
to  kill  Chastelard  on  the  spot.  But  the  calmer  states- 
man put  him  under  arrest  for  more  deliberate  condem- 
nation. Two  days  later  he  walked  to  the  scaffold,  re- 
citing Ronsard's  hymn  to  death ;  and  when  he  stood 
ready  for  the  fatal  blow,  he  raised  his  eyes  to  Heaven 
and  exclaimed,  "  O  cruelle  dame !  "  The  wide-spread 
and  deep  sensation  produced  by  this  tragical  affair, 
which,  whatever  the  desert  of  "  the  mad  lover,"  tar- 
nished Mary's  reputation,  urged  upon  her  the  neces- 
sity of  marriage.  Amid  the  many  politic  offers  of  an 
alliance,  Elizabeth  about  this  time  proposed,  through 
her  ambassador,  Randolph,  Lord  Robert  Dudley,  son 
of  the  Duke  of  Northumberland.  He  had  wisely 
governed  England  under  Edward  VI.,  but  presented 
no  inducement  to  Mary  Stuart,  unless  her  haughty 


92  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

rival  would  secure  the  riiiht  of  succession.  Besi&lt;l&lt;  , 
another  suitor  more  pnimiHnjr  to  her  ambition,  an&lt;l 
more  pleasing  to  her  fancy,  entered  the  field  of  this 
matrimonial  tournament.  Lord  Henry  Darnley  was 
the  son  of  the  Earl  of  Lennox,  a  refugee  in  England 
for  having  joined  the  cause  of  Henry  VIII.,  who 
married  Lady  Margaret  Douglas,  daughter  of  Mar- 
garet Tudor,  widow  of  James  IV.  Connected  thus 
with  the  royal  families  of  both  England  and  Scot- 
land, and  a  young  gentleman  of  very  fine  personal  ap- 
pearance and  elegant  manners,  Darnley  was  a  favor- 
ite with  the  Queen.  His  mother  had,  since  Mary's 
return,  been  secretly  planning  for  her  son's  promo- 
tion, unconscious  that  it  would  be  his  ruin.  Lennox 
was  invited  to  resume  the  lands  and  honors  which  lie 
had  forfeited  and  abandoned  in  Scotland;  ElizalM-th 
consented,  and  the  earl  arrived  on  his  ancestral  do- 
main, September,  1564.  Mary  lavished  her  favors 
upon  him,  though  it  excited  anew  the  displeasure  of 
the  Ilamiltons,  his  bitter  enemies.  Mary  determined, 
after  consulting  him,  before  a  final  resolution  on  the 
subject,  to  ascertain  more  fully  Eli/nlieth's  views  of 
her  prospective  marriage,  and  the  two  suitors.  She 
therefore  dispatched  James  Melvil,  a  finished  diplo- 
matist, a  scholar,  and  an  MCOmplished  gentleman,  to 
the  English  eourt.  Eli/al&gt;etli,  who-i-  vanity  was  as 
proverbial  as  her  policy,  received  Melvil  with  every 
mark  of  distinction.  lie  was  a  guest  of  Lady  Straf- 
ford,  the  Queen's  confidant — Elizabeth  entertained 
him  with  her  music,  and  danced  in  his  pr  1I&gt; 

displayed  his  tact  and  talent  in  the  reply  to  the  ques- 
tion, the  color  of  whose  hair  was  reputed  host — that 
of  her  own  or  of  the  Queen  of  Scotland?  He  an- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  93 

swered  that  "  there  was  no  one  in  England  compara- 
ble to  her,  and  no  one  in  Scotland  so  beautiful  as 
Mary  Stuart."  She  was  not  satisfied  with  so  equivocal 
a  compliment,  and  Melvil  assured  her,  she  excelled 
Mary  in  complexion,  music  and  dancing.  Such  flat- 
teries  reached  the  proud  heart  of  Elizabeth.  She 
kissed  the  portrait  of  Mary  Stuart,  and  smiled  bright- 
ly on  Melvil.  He,  however,  assured  her,  that  Lord 
Robert  Dudley  would  fail  of  winning  the  hand  of  his 
sovereign.  She  replied  excitedly,  "  Lord  Robert  is 
my  best  friend ;  I  love  him  as  a  brother,  and  I  would 
myself  have  married  him,  had  I  ever  minded  to  have 
taken  a  husband.  But  being  determined  to  end  my 
life  in  virginity,  I  wished  that  the  Queen,  my  sister, 
might  marry  him,  as  meetest  of  all  others  with  whom 
I  could  find  it  in  my  heart  to  declare  my  succession. 
For  being  matched  with  him,  it  would  best  remove 
out  of  my  mind  all  fears  and  suspicions  to  be  of- 
fended by  any  usurpation  before  my  death;  being 
assured  that  he  is  so  loving  and  trusty,  that  he  would 
never  permit  any  such  thing  to  be  attempted  during 
my  time.  And  that  the  Queen,  your  mistress,  may 
have  the  higher  esteem  of  him,  I  will  make  him,  in  a 
few  days,  Earl  of  Leicester,  and  Baron  of  Denbigh." 
Soon  afterward  Elizabeth  fulfilled  her  pledge,  and 
ith  her  own  hand  placed  the  coronet  of  an  earl  upon 
brow,  and  when  the  splendid  ceremonies  were 
T,  she  turned  to  Melvil  and  asked  his  opinion  of 
Judley.  He  replied,  t:  that  as  he  was  a  worthy  ser- 
vant, so  he  was  happy  who  had  a  princess  who  could 
discern  and  reward  good  service."  Pointing  to  Darn- 
ley,  who,  as  nearest  prince  of  the  blood,  bore  the 
sword  of  honor,  she  added,  "  Yet  you  like  better  yon- 


94  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

dcr  long  lad."  With  a  courtier's  deceptive  speech,  he 
told  her  "  that  no  woman  of  spirit  would  make  choice 
of  such  a  man,  who  was  more  like  a  woman  than  a 
111:111,  for  he  was  handsome,  beard  less,  and  lady-faced." 

During  repeated  interview?,  Elizabeth  affirmed 
that  if  Mary  would  marry  Lord  Dudley,  the  matter 
of  succession  would  be  arranged.  She  said  "  that  it 
was  her  own  resolution  to  remain  till  her  death,  a 
virgin  Queen,  and  that  nothing  would  compel  her  to 
change  her  mind,  except  the  undutiful  behavior  of  the 
Queen,  her  sister."  Melvil  records,  that  upon  his  de- 
parture for  Scotland,  "  she  used  all  the  means  she 
could  to  oblige  me  to  persuade  the  Queen,  my  mis- 
tress, of  the  great  love  she  did  bear  unto  her,  and  that 
she  was  fully  minded  to  put  away  all  jealousies  and 
suspicions,  and  in  times-coming  to  entertain  a  stricter 
friendship  than  formerly."  The  conclusion  seems 
inevitable,  that  Elizabeth  was  patriotic  as  well  as  am- 
bitious, and  the  glory  of  England  was  more  attrac- 
tive than  the  heartless  mockery  of  love  in  a  royal  mar- 
riage. It  doubtless  would  have  been  her  choice,  that 
Mnry  should  live  single  like  herself,  and  this  policy 
entered  into  her  proposal  of  Lord  Dudley,  who,  she 
must  have  known,  would  have  been  rejected  without 
the  condition  of  the  renewed  succession  to  the  Queen 
of  Scots. 

The  following  letter  is  an  interesting  review  of  the 
events  which  have  been  related:

begged  so  earnestly  to  be  taken  into  my  service,  that, 
without  considering  his  youth,  as  I  had  before  done, 
I  would  not  let  him  set  out  without  this  short  letter, 
in  which  I  shall  give  you  much  news,  referring  to  that 
which  I  have  commanded  him  to  say  relative  to  the 
appointments  of  the  Duke,*  and  of  the  Earl  of  Len- 
nox, for  the  doing  of  which  the  more  easily,  it  was 
necessary  that  this  duke  should  resign  to  you  the  pro- 
vostship  of  Glasgow,  agreeably  to  the  promise  which 
he  made  you.  I  assured  him  that  you  would  assent 
either  to  my  disposing  of  it,  or  reserving  it  for  you, 
being  certain  that,  at  my  request,  and  for  my  service, 
you  would  at  any  time  give  it  back  to  the  said  Earl 
of  Lennox,  as  the  bearer  will  tell  you ;  also  about  the 
return  of  Melvil,  whom  I  sent  to  the  Queen,  my  good 
sister,  with  an  apology  for  some  letters  which  I  had 
written  to  her,  and  which  she  considered  rather  rude ; 
but  she  took  the  interpretation  which  he  put  upon 
them  in  good  part,  and  has  since  sent  me  Randolph, 
who  is  here  at  present,  and  has  brought  me  some  very 
kind  and  polite  letters,  written  by  her  own  hand,  con- 
taining fair  words,  and  some  complaints  that  the 

Queen  f   and   her   ambassador, had 

assured  her  that  I  had  published  in  mockery  propo-

period  of  twenty  years.  He  died  in  Paris  in  1603,  at  the  age

sals  which  she  had  made  me  to  marry  Lord  Robert.* 
I  mnot  imagine  that  any  of  those  over  there  could 
\\isli  to  embroil  me  M&gt;  much  with  her,  since  I  have 
neither  spoken  to  anybody,  nor  written  respecting 
this  proposal,  not  even  to  the  Queen,  who,  I  am  sure, 
A\»uld  not  have  Ix.rne  sucli  testimony  against  me; 
hut  I  have  thought  of  writing  about  it  to  M.  de  Foix,

thing, talk  to  him  on  his  return  from  England;  lot

I  shall  not  fail  to  dispatch  to  you  a  gentleman,  who 
will  acquaint  you  with  all  that  has  occurred,  more  at 
length  than  I  can  inform  you  at  present.  Meanwhile 
I  l&gt;eg  you  to  answer  the  letters  I  wrote  to  you  by 
Rolland,  and  give  me  a  circumstantial  account  of  all 
the  news  where  you  are.  I  conclude  at  present,  rec- 
ommending myself  heartily  to  you,  praying  God  to 
give  you  his  grace.

At  the  lx?ginning  of  the  year  1565,  Mary  Stuart, 
having  retired  to  St.  Andrews  for  an  interlude  to  the 
cares  of  the  palace,  Randolph  visited  her  there  at  thn 
repeated  solicitation  of  Elizabeth.     He  has  given 
sketch  of  the  interview. 

'  Her  grace  lodged  in  a  merchant's  house;  her 
train  was  very  few;  and  there  was  small  repair  from 
any  part.  Her  will  was,  that,  for  the  time  that  I  did

tarry  I  should  dine  and  sup  with  her.  Your  majesty 
was  oftentimes  dranken  unto  by  her,  at  dinners  and 
suppers.  Having  in  this  sort  continued  with  her 
grace  Sunday,  Monday,  and  Tuesday,  I  thought  it 
time  to  take  occasion  to  utter  that  which  last  I  re- 
ceived in  command  from  your  majesty,  by  Mr.  Sec- 
retary's letter ;  which  was  to  know  her  grace's  resolu- 
tion, touching  those  matters  propounded  at  Berwick 
by  my  Lord  of  Bedford  and  me,  to  my  Lord  of  Mur- 
ray, and  Lord  of  Liddington  ;  I  had  no  sooner  spoken 
these  words,  but  she  saith,  ^  I  see  now  well  that  you 
are  weary  of  this  company  and  treatment ;  I  sent  for 
you  to  be  merry,  and  to  see  how  like  a  Bourgeoise  wife 
I  live,  with  my  little  troop,  and  you  will  interrupt  our 
pastime  with  your  great  and  grave  matters;  I  pray 
you,  sir,  if  you  be  weary  here,  return  home  to  Edin- 
burgh, and  keep  your  gravity  and  great  embassade 
until  the  Queen  come  thither ;  for  I  assure  you,  you 
shall  not  get  her  here,  nor  I  know  not  myself  where 
she  is  become;  you  see  neither  cloth  of  estate,  nor 
such  appearance  that  you  may  think  there  is  a  Queen 
here ;  nor  I  would  not  that  you  should  think  that  I 
am  she  at  St.  Andrews,  that  I  was  at  Edinburgh/ 

"  I  said  that  I  was  very  sorry  for  that,  for  that  at 
Edinburgh  she  said  that  she  did  love  my  mistress,  the 
Queen's  majesty,  better  than  any  other,  and  now  I 
marveled  how  her  mind  was  altered.  It  pleased  her 
at  this  to  be  very  merry,  and  called  me  by  more 
names  than  were  given  me  at  my  christening.  At 
these  merry  conceits  much  good  sport  was  made. 
'  But  well,  sir,'  saith  she,  { that  which  then  I  spoke  in 
words  shall  be  confirmed  to  my  good  sister,  your  mis- 
tress, in  writing ;  before  you  go  out  of  this  town  you

shall  have  a  letter  unto  her,  and  for  myself,  go  where 
you  will,  I  care  no  more  for  you.*  The  next  day  I 
was  willed  to  be  at  my  ordinary  table,  being  placed 
tho  next  person  (saving  worthy  Beaton  *)  to  the 
Queen's  self. 

"Very  merrily  she  pa-seili  her  time:  after  dinner 
&gt;lio  rideth  abroad.  It  pleased  her  the  most  part  of 
the  time  to  talk  with  me;  she  had  occasion  to  speak 
much  of  France,  for  the  honor  she  received  there;  to 
be  wife  unto  a  great  king,  and  for  friendship  shown 
unto  her  in  particular,  by  many,  for  which  occasions 
she  is  bound  to  love  the  nation,  to  show  them  pleas- 
ure and  to  do  them  good. 

"  Her  acquaintance  is  not  so  forgotten  there,  nor 
her  friendship  so  little  esteemed,  but  yet  it  is  divers 
ways  sought  to  be  continued.  She  hath  of  her  peo- 
ple, many  well  affected  that  way,  for  the  nourriture 
that  they  have  had  there,  and  the  commodity  of  ser- 
vice, as  those  of  the  guard,  and  men  at  arms ;  besides, 
privileges  great  for  the  merchants,  more  than  ever 
were  granted  to  any  nation.  What  privately,  of  long 
time,  hath  been  sought,  and  yet  is,  for  myself  to  yield 
unto  their  desires  in  my  marriage,  her  majesty  cannot 
be  ignorant,  and  you  have  heard.  To  have  such 
friends,  and  see  such  offers  (without  assurance  of  as 
good,)  nobody  will  give  me  advice  that  loveth  me.  \«&gt;t 
to  marry,  you  know,  it  cannot  be  for  me:  to  defer  it 
long,  many  incommodities  ensue.  How  privy  to  my 
mind,  your  mistress  hath  been  herein ;  how  willing  I 
am  to  follow  her  advice,  I  have  shown  many  times, 

*  Mary  Beaton,  who,  from  her  infancy,  had  been  a  maid  of 
honor.  She  was  the  niece  of  Cardinal  Beaton. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  99 

and  yet  can  I  find  in  her  no  resolution  nor  determina- 
tion. For  nothing,  I  cannot  be  bound  unto  her ;  and 
to  France,  my  will  against  her.  I  have  lately  given 
assurance  to  my  brother  of  Murray  and  Liddington, 
that  I  am  loath,  and  so  do  now  show  unto  yourself,  if 
your  mistress  did,  as  she  hath  said,  use  me  as  her  nat- 
ural born  sister  or  daughter,  I  will  show  no  less  read- 
iness to  oblige  and  honor  her  than  my  elder  sister  or 
mother ;  but,  if  she  will  repute  me  always  but  as  her 
neighbor,  Queen  of  Scots,  how  willingly  soever  I  be 
to  live  in  amity,  and  to  maintain  peace ;  yet  must  she 
not  look  for  that  at  my  hands,  that  otherwise  I  would, 
or  she  desireth.  To  forsake  friendship  offered,  and 
present  commodity  for  uncertainty,  no  friend  will 
advise  me,  nor  your  mistress  herself  approve  my  wis- 
dom. Let  her,  therefore,  measure  my  case  as  her 
own,  and  so  will  I  be  to  her.  For  these  causes,  until 
my  sister  and  I  have  further  proceeded,  I  must  apply 
my  mind  to  the  advice  of  those  that  seem  to  tender 
most  my  profit,  that  show  their  care  over  me,  and 
wish  me  most  good." 

At  this  crisis,  Darnley,  a  youth  of  nineteen,  joined 
his  father  in  Scotland.  The  motives  which  governed 
Elizabeth  in  permitting  him  to  leave  her  realm  are 
not  certainly  known.  It  is  most  natural,  certainly,  to 
suppose,  that  while  continental  princes  were  expec- 
tant of  success,  and  Darnley's  presence  could  not 
make  matters  worse;  she  also  granted  the  request  as 
a  condescension  to  him.  The  young  lord  was  a 
shrewd  dissembler  and  a  captivating  suitor.  He 
placed  himself  under  Murray's  guidance — in  the 
morning  went  to  hear  Knox  preach,  and  in  the  even- 


100  MARY  grF.F.N    &lt;&gt;F  SCOTS. 

ing  danced  a  gilliard  with  Mary.  The  Protestant 
church  he  would  thus  conciliate,  and  also  -eenre  the 
favor  of  the  court.  Educated  a  Catholic,  he  was 
in  ither  a  devotee  of  Koine,  nor  an  adherent  of  Knox. 
But  Murray  was  not  so  easily  won. 

From  this  moment  the  struggle  began  bet  WITH  the 
two  candidates  of  the  Reformers  and  Catholics;  be- 
tween Leicester,  who  was  supported  by  Lethington 
and  Murray — and  Darnley,  who  was  strongly 
tained  by  the  Earl  of  Athol,  all  the  Scottish  baron- 
\vho  had  remained  faithful  to  their  ancient  creed,  ami 
an  Italian  named  David  Rizzio,  who  had  succeeded 
Raullet  as  the  Queen's  Secretary  for  French  corre- 
spondence, and  who  had  already  gained  great  influ- 
ence over  her.  Lethington,  at  this  time,  wrote  to 
(  Veil  a  number  of  letters,  full  of  the  most  polite  con- 
siderations, in  favor  of  a  marriage  which  he  thought 
might  be  so  useful  to  their  common  cause  and  their 
two  countries,  and  besought  him  to  obtain  from  Eliz- 
alx'th  that  concession  which  alone  was  needed  to  en- 
sure its  success.  But  Elizabeth  complained  that  this 
was  transforming  the  negotiation  too  much  into  a 
matter  of  bargain,  and  jocularly  told  Melvil,  that 
Lethington,  in  his  constant  allusions  to  the  succession, 
was,  like  a  death-watch,  ever  ringing  her  knell  in  her 
ears.  Lethington  replied  that  his  mistress  merely 
sought  a  probable  reason  to  lay  against  the  objections 
of  foreign  princes,  that  they  might  see  that  no  vain 
•  &gt;r  lijiht  conceit  had  moved  her  to  yield  to  the  Queen 
of  England's  request  in  her  marriage.  As  for  him- 
self, giving  way  to  an  enthusiasm  which  was  far  from 
habitual  in  him,  lie  reminded  Cecil  of  the  union  of 
an.l  Scotland,  which  would  !*&gt;  efl  '-mated  by 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  101 

this  marriage,  in  language  full  of  noble  patriotism. 
"  Such  a  stroke  of  policy,"  he  remarked,  "  would 
secure  for  us  a  more  glorious  memory,  a  more  unfad- 
ing gratitude  in  the  ages  to  come,  than  belongs  to 
those  who  did  most  valiantly,  serve  king  Edward  the 
First  in  his  conquest,  or  king  Robert  the  Bruce  in 
his  recovery  of  the  country." 

Murray  took  a  similar  view,  and  urged  the  claims 
of  Lord  Dudley.  If  Elizabeth  was  ambitious  in  re- 
fusing to  nominate  her  sister  successor,  Mary  was  no 
less  aspiring  in  rejecting  Dudley,  if  the  English 
crown  prospectively  were  not  made  the  premium  of 
acceptance.  A  definite  declaration  becoming  neces- 
sary, Elizabeth  directed  Randolph  to  communicate  to 
Mary  Stuart  her  decision  not  to  recognize  the  right 
of  succession  in  any  emergency;  but  if  the  Earl  of 
Leicester  were  accepted  as  such,  she  would  have  no 
cause  to  repent  the  confidence  reposed  in  her  munifi- 
cence. When  the  message  was  delivered,  the  Queen 
of  Scots  wept  long  and  violently.  The  storm  passed, 
and  Mary's  feelings  and  purpose  turned  toward  Darn- 
ley.  She  admired  him,  and  there  was  probably  more 
affection  indulged  than  she  had  known  toward  any 
other  lover  since  Francis  died.  The  step  was  one  of 
collision  with  Murray,  who  opposed  the  marriage,  and 
developed  the  opposition  of  the  Protestant  party,  with 
the  hostility  of  the  Hamiltons,  foes  of  Lennox ;  while 
Elizabeth  saw  in  it  a  probable  alliance  with  the  Cath- 
olic powers  of  Europe,  which  would  array  against 
her  the  subjects  of  her  own  realm  who  maintained 
the  Romish  faith.  Mary  having  settled  the  choice  of 
a  husband,  addressed  herself  to  the  work  of  reducing 
the  strength  of  opposers.  She  recalled  from  France 


102  MAKY  yfKKX   OF  SCOTS. 

the  dissolute  Earl  of  Botlnfcll.  to  confront  Murray, 
whom  he  intensely  hated,  nnd  proposed  the  restora- 
tion of  Earl  Huntly,  whose  family  Murray  had  dis- 
graced. She  likewise  endeavored  to  convert  her 
brother  to  her  plans,  by  commanding  his  return  to 
the  court  from  which  he  had  withdrawn,  and  de- 
manding his  signature  to  a  paper  approving  her  mar- 
riage. This  he  refused,  and  gave  reasons  of  state 
and  church  policy.  Mary  was  indignant,  and  with- 
out sufficient  ground,  charged  him  with  aiming  his 
rebellion  at  her  crown.  The  result  was  open  war  be- 
tween them. 

Murray  appeared  in  Edinburgh  with  five  or  six 
thousand  men,  to  procure  Bothwell's  condemnation, 
and  entered  into  a  league  with  the  Duke  of  Chatelle- 
rault  and  Earl  of  Argyle  for  mutual  aid  and  de- 
fence. He  conferred  with  the  Protestant  clergy  con- 
cerning their  protection,  and  applied,  through  Ran- 
dolph to  Elizabeth,  for  whatever  help  she  might  be 
willing  to  afford.  The  choice  of  Darnley  had  been  de- 
clared in  the  Privy  Council  of  the  Queen  of  England, 
"  prejudicial  to  both  Queens,  and  consequently  dan- 
gerous to  the  weal  of  both  countries."  She  sent 
Throckmorton  to  carry  to  Mary  Stuart  that  opinion, 
and  once  more  propose  Lord  Dudley.  When  he 
reached  Scotland,  it  was  quite  too  late  to  interfere. 
She  had  not  only  watched  at  the  sick  bed  of  Darnley, 
but  on  the  1st  of  May,  1565,  she  announced  to  a  con- 
vention of  the  nobility,  which  she  had  called  for  the 
purpose,  her  intention  of  marrying  him.  The  meas- 
ure was  approved  unanimously;  and  she  then  added 
to  Darnley's  honors  the  lordship  of  Ardmanoch  and 
the  earldom  of  Ross.  She  replied  to  Throckmorton's 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  103 

message :  "  As  to  her  good  sister's  great  dislike  to 
the  match,  this  was,  indeed,  a  marvelous  circum- 
stance, since  the  selection  was  made  in  conformity  to 
the  Queen's  wishes,  as  communicated  by  Mr.  Ran- 
dolph. She  had  rejected  all  foreign  suitors,  and  had 
chosen  an  Englishman,  descended  from  the  blood 
royal  of  both  kingdoms,  and  the  first  prince  of  the 
blood  in  England ;  and  one  whom  she  believed  would, 
for  these  reasons,  be  acceptable  to  the  subjects  of  both 
realms." 

Mary  postponed  the  wedding,  if  possible,  to  pro- 
pitiate her  powerful  neighbor,  and  avoid  a  hopeless 
alienation.  Elizabeth  was  enraged,  and  sent  the 
Countess  of  Lennox,  Darnley's  mother,  who  was  still 
in  England,  to  the  Tower,  and  summoned  the  Earl 
and  his  son  to  return.  Lennox  refused,  until  assured 
of  the  Queen's  favor.  Darnley  replied  to  the  mes- 
senger, with  more  spirit :  "  I  do  now  acknowledge 
no  other  duty  or  obedience  but  to  the  Queen  here, 
whom  I  love  and  honor;  and  seeing  that  the  other, 
your  mistress,  is  so  envious  of  my  good  fortune,  I 
doubt  not  but  she  may  have  need  of  me,  as  you  shall 
know  within  a  few  days.  Wherefore  to  return  I  in- 
tend not ;  I  find  myself  very  well  where  I  am,  and 
so  purpose  to  keep  me ;  and  this  shall  be  your  an- 
swer." 

Elizabeth  assured  the  Reformers  of  her  support, 
who  made  a  desperate  effort  to  prevent  the  marriage. 
The  General  Assembly  of  the  Scottish  Church  met 
at  the  call  of  Knox  and  Earl  of  Argyle,  and  resolved 
to  petition  the  Queen  for  the  abolition  of  mass,  and 
uniformity  of  the  established  religion  throughout  her 
kingdom.  She  conceded  their  right  to  maintain  di- 


104  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

vine  worship  as  they  desired,  but  claimed  the  same 
toleration  toward  himself.  While  she  calmed  the 
fears  of  many,  Murray,  whose  whole  nature  was  in  a 
glow  of  indignation,  in  which  Mended  the  fires  of  hate 
to  Popery  and  personal  enemies,  and  the  apprehen- 
sion to  peril  to  both  church  and  state,  headed  a  plot  t«» 
surprise  Mary  and  Darnley,  on  their  way  from  Perth 
to  Callandcr — either  kill,  &lt;&gt;r  deliver  him  to  the  Eng- 
lish— imprison  Mary,  and  reinstate  Murray.  The 
conspiracy  was  detected,  and  the  only  alternative 
was  a  general  revolt. 

Murray  called  the  people  to  arms,  and  Mary  sum- 
moned the  vassals  of  the  crown  to  assemble  immedi- 
ately at  Edinburgh,  prepared  for  war.  She  issued  a 
proclamation,  designed  to  keep  the  church  tranquil, 
and  for  the  first  time  attended  at  Oallander,  the  ser- 
vices of  a  Presbyterian  minister,  and  heard  the  gos- 
pel from  what  she  deemed  heretical  lips.  This  was  a 
sacrifice  of  conscience,  to  prevent  an  uprising  of  the 
Reformers  to  join  the  rebellious  nobles.  She  felt  the 
need  of  haste,  to  remove  inducements  to  opposition, 
and  creating  Darnley  Duke  of  Albany,  she  received, 
July  22d,  a  dispensation  from  the  Pope  of  Rome, 
making  legal  her  marriage  with  a  cousin,  and  ap- 
pointed Sunday,  the  29th,  as  the  day  for  the  nuptials. 
The  preceding  day  she  gave  Darnley  the  title  of  King, 
which  completely  intoxicated  his  brain,  and  he  began 
to  show  his  consciousness  of  authority.  Wise  men 
shook  their  heads  at  the  strides  the  "  long  lad  "  was 
making. 

The  Sabbath  had  scarcely  dawned  when,  between 
five  and  six  o'clock,  Mary,  in  her  rich  mourning  ap- 
parel, and  the  noble  form  of  Darnley,  entered  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  105 

royal  chapel  of  Holyrood.  The  Dean  of  Restabrig 
performed  the  ceremony ;  the  Queen,  after  the  matri- 
monial salutation  from  Darnley,  kneeled  at  the  altar 
to  hear  mass,  while  he  retired  to  the  chase — avoiding, 
by  this  movement,  the  increased  suspicion  of  the 
Protestants.  Upon  reaching  her  palace,  Mary  put  off 
the  sable  attire  and  appeared  in  magnificent  bridal 
robes.  A  banquet  followed.  The  Earls  Athol,  Mor- 
ton, Crawford,  Eglington  and  Cassillis  were  table  at- 
tendants. Money  was  scattered  among  the  gathered 
populace,  and  the  scene  concluded  with  dancing  and 
festivity.  Darnley  flaunted  in  kingly  splendor,  and 
Mary  Stuart  dreamed  of  a  glorious  future,  as  the 
silence  of  morning  succeeded  "  music's  voluptuous 
swell,"  and  the  hum  of  excited  guests — a  brief  and 
delusive  vision ! 


CHAPTER  IV. 

MARY'S  marriage  to  Lord  Daraley  was  a  decisive 
stroke  in  her  destiny — the  glory-gilded  summit,  from 
which  her  descent  to  a  sea-girdled  prison  began.  The 
friendly  correspondence  that  had  for  four  years  ex- 
isted between  the  Queen  of  Scots  and  Elizabeth, 
closed ;  and  a  hostility  commenced,  which  necessarily 
involved  their  kingdoms.  Murray  had  not  been  idle, 
during  the  hymeneal  festivities  of  his  sister.  II'- 
wrote  to  the  Earl  of  Bedford,  to  "  crave  his  comfort, 
as  of  one  to  whom  God  had  granted  to  know  the  subtle 
devices  of  Satan,  against  the  innocent  professors  of 
the  gospel,  to  stir  up  the  powers  of  the  world  against 
the  same."  Randolph  urged  Elizabeth  to  aid  Mur- 
ray, "  unless  she  wished  to  see  Protestantism,  and  tin* 
English  party  in  Scotland,  fall  together."  She  had 
said  to  the  revolutionists,  "  Keep  your  sovereign  by 
all  lawful  means  from  doing  wrong,  and  you  shall 
have  all  the  help  which  I  can  give  you,  but  it  is  no 
part  of  a  subject's  duty  to  oppose  her  by  force."  Tho 
assistance  offered  was  scarcely  more  than  a  small  sum 
of  money,  leaving  the  insurgents  to  their  own  re- 
sources. Meanwhile,  the  bride  and  bridegroom  has- 
tened preparations  for  the  campaign.  In  the  capital, 
"  the  swash,  the  taborin,  and  the  drum,  were  stricken 
through  the  streets,  to  raise  recruits  for  the  army." 

M;iry  inarched  forth  to  meet  the  enemy.  Darnley 
rode  by  her  side  in  "  gilded  armor,"  the  Earl  of  Len-

nox  led  the  army,  Chancellor  Morton  commanded 
the  centre,  and  the  King  and  Queen,  attended  by  Par- 
son Balfour,  David  Rizzio,  and  another  Italian  mu- 
sician, brought  up  the  rear.  This  force  moved  so  rap- 
idly against  Murray,  that  he  was  compelled  to  fly 
from  Stirling  to  Glasgow,  and  thence  into  the  domain 
of  his  ally,  the  Earl  of  Argyle.  Mary  sent  back  the 
English  envoy,  Tamworth,  dispatched  by  Elizabeth 
with  a  "  haughty  message,"  who,  leaving  a  spirited 
reply,  was  intercepted  by  a  band,  because  he  refused 
to  acknowledge  Darnley  king,  and  was  carried  a  pris- 
oner to  Hume  Castle.  The  fugitive  Reformers  had 
no  alternative  but  to  collect  their  available  strength 
and  march  to  Edinburgh,  the  metropolis  of  the  realm, 
and  the  stronghold  of  Protestantism.  With  a  thou- 
sand men  Murray  reached  the  capital,  expecting  a 
general  uprising  of  the  people.  To  his  amazement, 
there  was  no  sympathy  displayed ;  none  came  to  his 
standard,  and  his  ranks  were  fired  upon  by  the  ord- 
nance of  the  castle.  The  citizens,  whatever  their  op- 
position to  Catholicism,  were  not  prepared  to  rise  in 
rebellion  against  their  beautiful  Queen. 

Another  appeal  by  the  party  in  revolt  was  made  to 
Cecil,  the  Queen's  adviser,  and  the  Earl  of  Bedford, 
who  commanded  the  English  army  on  the  frontier, 
for  three  thousand  men,  and  ships  of  war,  to  cruise 
in  the  Forth.  Elizabeth  delayed,  and  Mary  im- 
proved the  time.  She  assembled  a  force  of  ten  thou- 
sand men,  and  swept  Murray's  adherents  from  Edin- 
burgh, like  leaves  in  the  hurricane's  path.  She  then 
marched  into  the  county  of  Fife,  and  taught  submis- 
sion to  the  offending  barons.  Her  perfect  form  on  a

Leaving  her  routed  foe,  she  communicated  in  a  let-

plans,  and  view  of  the  civil  war. 

THE   QUEEN   OF  SCOTS   TO  THE   ARCHBISHOP  OF  GLAS- 
GOW. 

&lt;;  FROM  LISLEBOURO,  1st  October,  1565. 

"  Monsieur  de  Glasgow :  I  am  greatly  astonished ; 
for  a  very  long  time  I  have  received  no  tidings  from 
you,  not  even  Mauvissiere,  who  calls  himself  ambas- 
sador from  the  King.  I  beg  you  will  let  me  hear  of- 
tener  from  you.  As  for  any  news  hero,  you  must 
know  that  Mauvissiere  was  commissioned  to  treat 
preliminarily  between  me  and  the  Queen,  my  neigh- 
bor. This  I  willingly  agree  to;  but  as  to  treating 
with  my  subjects,  having  conducted  themselves  as 
they  have  done,  I  had  rather  lose  all. 

"  Now,  I  am  sure,  you  must  have  heard  enough 
upon  this  subject  from  your  brother,  and  since,  from 
Chalmer:  and  there  is  nothing  of  very  recent  occur- 
rence, but  that  they  are  getting  wor-o  and  worse,  and 
are  now  at  Dumfries,  whore  they  have  resolved  to 
stay  until  I  leave  this  place,  which  will  be  to-morrow, 
and  then  they  will  go,  as  I  am  informed,  to  Annan, 
which  they  propose  to  defend  against  me  with  the  aid 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

of  three  hundred  English  arquebusiers  of  the  garrison 
of  England :  and  they  boast  that  they  shall  receive 
more  succors,  both  by  sea  and  land,  so  as  to  be  able  to 
make  head  against  our  army,  which  is  to  set  out  to- 
morrow, or  the  next  day  at  the  latest,  and  with  which 
the  King  and  I  intend  to  go  in  person,  hoping  that, 
the  time  of  the  proclamation  having  expired,  we  shall 
retire  and  give  them  time  to  wait  for  the  army  of  the 
Queen  of  England,  which  is  to  be  ready  next  spring. 
Urge  the  Queen  as  often  as  you  can,  and  by  all  the 
means  in  your  power,  to  send  us  men  and  money  in 
this  emergency,  and  then  write  forthwith  what  I  have 
to  hope  for :  and  beware,  above  all  things,  of  exciting 
the  jealousy  of  a  certain  person  whom  you  know,  and 
with  whom  you  must  privately  use  the  like  persua- 
sions. Something  was  known  at  court  about  your 
dealings  with  Bay. 

"  I  shall  write  you  more  fully  on  the  first  opportu- 
nity; but  above  all,  keep  a  good  look-out,  and  see  if 
my  rebels  hold  any  secret  communication  over  there 
with  the  Protestants,  or  Chatillon ;  and  if  the  Duke 
and  Earl  of  Murray  have  any  agent  about  the  Queen, 
whom  you  may  assure  that  they  have  full  liberty  of 
conscience,  and  that  this  is  not  the  motive  which  in- 
fluences them,  nor  the  public  welfare ;  for  I  have 
made  no  changes  in  the  order  of  things  to  which  they 
have  themselves  consented;  and  if  they  were  not  at 
the  council,  it  has  been  because  I  never  could  get 
them  to  come  to  it  after  my  marriage,  except  a  few, 
who,  after  taking  part  against  them,  subsequently 
went  over  to  their  side,  which  they  now  begin  to  re- 
pent of,  and  among  others  the  duke  and  Gudo,  .  .  » 
who  have  sent  me  word  to  that  effect. 


1  |i»  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  Yesterday,  Dromlevcriel  and  Tx&gt;wener  sent  to  me 
to  beg  pardon,  saving  they  would  serve  us,  assuring 
me  they  had  forsaken  them,  finding  their  intentions 
so  different  from  what  they  represented.  The  traitor 
Maxwell  is  deeply  ashamed  of  having  so  basely  broken 
his  faith  with  me;  he  does  not  appear  disposed  to  send 
his  son  to  England  as  an  hostage,  not  having  forgot- 
ten how  his  last  was  treated ;  this  he  sent  me  word 
himself.  In  short,  when  England  pereeives  that  we 
have  ever  so  little  suecor  to  hope  for,  they  will  draw 
hack,  I  should  think,  from  seeing  those  people  so  dis- 
heartened. You  will  see  the  memorandum  which  I 
have  given  to  the  bearer,  of  what  he  is  to  say  to  the 
king,  instead  of  instructions.  Tell  me  how  he  ac- 
quits himself  of  his  commission,  for  I  assure  you  he  is 
more  English  than  Scotch.  Here  I  conclude,  pray- 
ing God  to  grant  you  a  happy  and  long  life 

"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MARY  R." 

She  expressed  her  estimate  of  the  rebels  fully,  in  a 
proclamation  issued  at  this  crisis  of  affairs. 

"  Certain  rebels,  the  authors  of  this  uproar  lately 
raised  up  against  us,  have  given  the  people  to  under- 
stand that  the  quarrel  they  have  in  hand  is  only  reli- 
gion, thinking  with  that  cloak  to  cover  their  ungodly 
designs,  and  to  draw  after  them  a  large  train  of  ig- 
norant persons,  easy  to  be  seduced Their  am- 

hition  could  not  be  satisfied  with  heaping  riches  upon 
riches,  and  honor  upon  honor,  unless  they  retain  in 
their  hands,  us,  and  our  whole  realm,  to  be  led,  used, 
:m&lt;l  &lt;li&gt;|Mi-ed  at  their  pleasure.  We  must  be  forced 
to  govern  by  counsel,  such  as  it  shall  please  them  to 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  HI 

appoint  us — and  what  other  thing  is  this,  but  to  dis- 
solve the  whole  policy,  and  (in  a  manner)  to  invert 
the  very  order  of  nature,  to  make  the  prince  obey, 
and  subjects  command.  The  like  was  never  de- 
manded by  any  of  our  most  noble  progenitors  hereto- 
fore, yea,  not  of  governors  and  regents.  When  we  our- 
selves were  of  less  age,  and  at  our  first  returning  into 
this  our  realm,  we  had  free  choice  of  our  council  at 
our  pleasure,  and  now,  when  we  are  at  our  full  ma- 
turity, shall  we  be  brought  back  to  the  state  of  pupils, 
and  be  put  under  tutory  ?  This  is  the  quarrel  of  re- 
ligion they  made  you  believe  they  had  in  hand ;  this 
is  the  quarrel  for  which  they  would  have  you  hazard 
your  lands,  lives,  and  goods,  in  the  company  of  a  cer- 
tain number  of  rebels,  against  your  natural  prince. 
To  speak  in  good  (plain)  language,  they  would  be 
kings  themselves,  or  at  the  least,  leaving  to  us  the  bare 
name  and  title,  and  take  to  themselves  the  credit  and 
whole  administration  of  the  kingdom." 

She  concluded  with  a  promise  of  security  to  their 
possessions,  and  liberty  of  conscience,  on  condition 
of  loyalty  to  their  sovereign.  A  final  entreaty  was 
sent  by  the  insurgents  to  Elizabeth,  to  save  the  im- 
periled church,  and  deliver  the  persecuted,  who  were 
exposed  to  Mary's  displeasure,  they  affirmed,  through 
the  baneful  influence  of  Rizzio  and  Darnley,  both 
foreigners,  assuming  without  right  or  the  consent  of 
the  people,  authority  in  the  cabinet  and  over  the 
kingdom.  She  had  ordered  troops  and  money  to  be 
placed  at  the  command  of  Murray;  but  a  few  days 
later,  hearing  of  his  defeat,  countermanded  the  order 
and  abandoned  the  cause,  with  an  expression  of  lively 
sympathy.  The  English  Queen  was  cautious  and  art-

"  Monsieur  my  .good  hrother — the  interest  which 
you  have  always  taken  in  the  maintenance  and  sup- 
]x&gt;rt  of  our  ('atholic  religion,  induced  me  some  time 
since  to  solicit  your  favor  and  assistance,  as  I  foresaw 
•what  has  now  taken  place  in  the  kingdom,  and  which 
tends  to  the  utter  ruin  of  the  Catholics,  and  to  the

favor,  we  have  determined  upon  •ddreoUBg  onr.-elves 
to  yon,  in  preference  to  any  other,  to  solicit  your  ad- 
vice, and  to  strengthen  ourselves  with  your  aid  and 
Mipport.  To  obtain  this,  we  have  dispatched  to  you

this  English  gentleman,  a  Catholic,  and  a  faithful  ser- 
vant of  the  King,  my  husband,  and  of  myself,  with 
ample  directions  to  give  you  an  account  of  the  state 
of  our  affairs,  which  he  is  well  acquainted  with ;  and 
we  beg  you  to  believe  him  as  you  would  do  ourselves, 
and  to  send  him  back  as  soon  as  possible ;  for  occasions 
are  so  urgent,  that  it  is  of  importance  both  for  the 
crown  and  the  liberty  of  the  church ;  to  maintain 
which  we  will  risk  our  lives  and  our  kingdom,  pro- 
vided we  are  assured  of  your  assistance  and  advice. 

"  After  kissing  your  hands,  I  pray  God  to  give  you, 
monsieur  my  good  brother,  every  prosperity  and  fe- 
licity. Your  very  good  sister, 

"  MAEY  R." 

This  monarch,  who  was  the  royal  head  of  Papacy 
in  Europe,  sent,  in  reply  to  her  solicitation,  twenty 
thousand  crowns,*  and  wrote  to  the  Pope,  who  added 
eight  thousand  more.  This  pontiff  expressed  his  re- 
grets that  he  could  not  then  offer  any  other  assistance, 
and  also  said  that  the  hope  of  asserting,  by  armed 
force,  Mary's  right  of  succession  to  the  throne  of 
England  must  not  be  renounced,  and  gives  the  reason : 
"  This  project  concerns  the  cause  of  God,  which  is 
mentioned  by  the  Queen  of  Scotland,  since  it  is  evi- 
dently the  only  door  by  which  religion  can  enter  into 
the  kingdom  of  England,  for  all  others  are  now  shut." 

Refusing  mediation  offered  by  Castelnau  de  Mau- 
vissiere,  the  French  ambassador,  Mary  affirmed  in  a 
proud  speech,  "  I  would  rather  lose  all  than  treat  with 

*  The  English  crown  of  the  present  day  is  worth  $1.21.  In 
the  sixteenth  century  the  value  varied  somewhat,  but  was 
generally  worth  a  little  less  than  that  of  to-day.

my  subjects,"  and  a  third  time,  October  9th,  accom- 
panied by  Both  well  and  Hunt  Icy,  marched  with  about 
twelve  thousand  men  toward  Dumfries,  to  expel  the 
remnant  of  the  revolutionary  party.  Murray's  small 
force  was  routed  at  the  first  onset,  and  he  fled  into 
England  on  the  14th  of  the  same  month.  The  Queen 
of  Scots  was  victorious,  and  in  the  giddiness  of  ele- 
vation, she  resorted  to  vengeance.  She  determined 
to  condemn  as  traitors  the  rebel  lords,  and  with 
the  sympathy  of  the  English  Catholics,  she  thought 
to  make  even  the  haughty  Elizabeth  repent  of 
whatever  encouragement  she  had  given  the  insur- 
gents. She  incautiously  remarked  to  some  of  her  no- 
He*,  who  expressed  a  fear  that  her  continual  riding 
and  much  exposure  to  storms  would  prove  exhausting 
— "  That  she  would  never  cease  to  continue  in  such 
fatigues,  until  she  hud  led  them  into  London."  Her 
tone  became  dictatorial  to  Elizabeth,  who  in  turn 
surprised  and  perplexed.  The  Spanish  and  French 
ambassadors  at  her  court  increased  her  embarrass- 
ment by  defending  Mary's  interests.  Elizabeth  col- 
lected troops  on  the  frontier,  and  summoned  promi- 
nent Catholic  nobles  in  council,  the  real  motive  of 
which  was,  apprehension  that  they  were  favorable  to 
the  designs  of  her  now  resolute  and  enthusiastic  rival. 
To  calm  Mary's  displeasure,  she  also  affected  indig- 
nation towards  Murray,  and  made  him  publicly  deny 
that  he  had  received  the  least  aid  from  her  in  the  re- 
bellion. Then  addressing  him  in  the  presence  of  the 
French  ambassador,  she  said,  angrily: 

"If  i-  well  that  you  have  told  the  truth;  for 
neither  did  I,  nor  any  mic  else  in  my  name,  ever  en- 
courage you  in  your  unnatural  rebellion  against  your 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  H5 

sovereign ;  nor,  to  be  mistress  of  a  world,  could  I 
maintain  any  subject  in  disobedience  to  his  prince ;  it 
might  move  God  to  punish  me  by  a  similar  trouble 
in  my  own  realm ;  but  as  for  you  two,  ye  are  unwor- 
thy traitors,  and  I  command  you  instantly  to  leave 
my  presence." 

There  is  a  consistency  in  this  with  the  rule  Eliza- 
beth had  before  given,  in  respect  to  the  duty  of  sub- 
jects. It  is  not  certain  that  she  favored  the  uprising 
of  the  people  as  designed  by  Murray,  however  she 
desired  to  prevent  a  marriage  she  disliked,  or  feared 
Mary's  pretensions.  The  Queen  of  Scots  was  advised 
to  be  merciful  to  her  foes,  as  a  matter  of  policy  at 
least,  to  increase  her  power,  and  avoid  occasion  of  fur- 
ther complaint  with  Elizabeth.  But  passion  ruled  the 
sovereign,  and  following  the  advice  of  her  foreign 
relatives,  she  planned  the  death  of  offenders,  by  con- 
demnation, at  the  meeting  of  the  next  Parliament. 

David  Rizzio,  since  he  came  to  Mary's  court,  in 
1562,  in  the  suite  of  the  Count  of  Moretto,  the  Savoy 
ambassador,  had  been  gaming  ascendency  over  the 
Queen.  From  the  office  of  valet,  he  rose  to  that  of 
private  secretary  in  1564,  on  the  removal  of  Raulet. 
He  was  now  at  the  zenith  of  influence  in  the  palace. 
"  The  greater  part  of  the  affairs  of  the  kingdom 
passed  through  his  hands.  He  managed  them  with  so 
much  prudence,  and  brought  them  to  so  satisfactory 
a  conclusion,  that  he  was  greatly  beloved  by  her 
majesty."  Gorgeous  in  equipage  and  style  of  living, 
flattered  and  caressed,  he  became  haughty  and  pre- 
sumptuous. Mary's  reputation  was  injured  by  his 
singular  influence  and  royal  living.  Elizabeth,  com- 
plaining of  Murray's  presumption,  said,  "  That  it

was  all  owing  to  an  Italian  named  David,  whom  the 
Queen  of  Scotland  loved  and  favored,  and  granted 
more  credit  and  authority  than  were  authorized  by 
her  alTair-  :in«l  honor." 

Ki/./io  \va&gt;  in  the  pay  of  tin-  Pope,  and  urged  Mary 
to  severity  towards  the  reliels.  Darnley  meanwhile 
had  hoou  losing  the  confidence  and  aflFection  of  the 
Queen.  Sir  William  Drury  wrote  to  Secretary  Cecil, 
in  the  following  strain  : 

"  All  people  say  that  Darnley  is  too  much  addicted 
to  drinking.  'Tis  certainly  reported  there  was  some 
jar  betwixt  the  Queen  and  him,  at  an  entertainment 
in  a  merchant's  house  in  Edinburgh,  she  only  dis- 
suaded him  from  drinking  too  much  himself,  and  en- 
ticing others;  in  both  which  he  proceeded,  and  gave 
her  such  words  that  she  left  the  place  with  tearsfj 
which  they  that  are  known  to  their  proceedings,  say 
i-  not  strange  to  be  seen.  These  jars  arise,  amongst 
other  things,  from  his  seeking  the  matrimonial  crown, 
which  she  will  not  yield  unto;  the  calling  in  of  the 
coin,  wherein  they  were  l&gt;oth,  and  the  duke's  (of  Cha- 
tellerault)  finding  so  favorable  address;  which  hath 
much  displeased  Inith  him  and  his  father.  Darnley

weary  of  him:  and.  a-  some  jndiie.  will  be  more  so 
ere  long;  for  true  it  is.  that  those  who  depend  wholly 
upon  him,  are  not  liked  of  her!  nor  they  that  follow 
her,  of  him;  as  David  IIi//io.  and  others;  some  say

have  arisen  some  unkind  speeches  about  signing  let- 
ters: he,  immediately  after  his  marriage,  signing 
first,  which  she  will  not  allow  of  now.  His  govern- 
ment is  very  much  blamed,  for  he  is  thought  to  be  wil- 
ful and  haughty,  and  some  say  vicious;  whereof  too 
many  were  witnesses,  the  other  day  at  Inchkeith,  with 
the  Lord  Arbroath,  Flemings,  and  such  like  grave  per- 
sonages." 

The  arrogant  Darnley  had  repeatedly  urged  Mary 
to  confer  upon  him  the  crown  matrimonial;  that  is 
to  say,  an  equal  share  in  tbe  government  of  the  realm, 
which  was  granted  to  Trancis  II.,  her  first  husband. 
She  steadily  refused  th&lt;  request,  because  she  despised 
his  inefficiency,  and  had  lost  whatever  affection  she 
entertained  for  him  at  an  early  period  of  their  ac- 
quaintance. The  disappointed  Darnley,  jealous  of 
Rizzio's  familiar  friendship  for  Mary,  and  seeing  a 
domestic  war  inevitable,  charged  his  own  failure  and 
her  displeasure  upon  the  Italian  secretary.  He  was 
the  captive  of  ambition  stimulated  by  that  demoniac 
passion,*  which  "  is  the  rage  of  a  man ;  therefore  he 
will  not  spare  in  the  day  of  vengeance."  The  purpose 
was  formed,  to  remove  iftie  hated  object,  and  disclosed 
to  his  cousin  George  Douglas.  He  also  sent  Douglas 
to  confer  with  Lord  Ruthven,  concerning  his  griefs, 
and  plans  of  revenge.  The  assassination  of  Rizzio, 
and  seizing  the  matrimonial  crown,  were  leading  de- 
signs of  the  conspiracy. 

Lord  Ruthven  was  an  invalid,  but  after  a  brief 
visitation,  consented  to  the  plot,  which  was  made 
known  to  Lord  Lindsay  and  Randolph.  The  latter

wrote  on  the  subject  to  Leicester ;  from  it  this  passage 
is  quoted : 

"  I  know  now  for  certain,  that  this  Queen  repent- 
eth  her  marriage;  that  she  hateth  him  (Darnley) 
and  all  his  kin.  I  know  that  he  knoweth  himself  that 
he  hath  a  partaker  in  play  and  game  with  him.  I 
know  that  there  are  practices  in  hand,  contrived  be- 
tween the  father  and  son  to  come  by  the  crown  against 
her  will.  I  know  that  if  that  take  effect  which  is  in- 
tended, David,  with  the  consent  of  the  King,  shall 
have  his  throat  cut  within  these  ten  days.  Many 
things  grievouser  and  worse  than  these  are  brought  to 
my  ears ;  yea,  of  things  intended  against  her  own  per- 
son, which,  because  I  think  better  to  keep  secret  than 
write  to  Mr.  Secretary  (Cecil),  I  speak  not  of  them 
but  now  to  your  lordship." 

The  conspiracy  progressed  secretly,  and  no  suspi- 
cion of  evil  darkened  the  horizon  of  Rizzio's  hopes. 
The  friends  of  Mary  and  Lennox  had  united  against 
Murray;  and  now  the  adherents  of  Lennox  sought  a 
coalition  with  the  party  in  revolt,  to  make  the  blow 
aimed  at  the  crown  successful.  The  Earl  of  Morton, 
a  relative  and  warm  friend  o£  Murray,  was  a  Protes- 
tant, and  Chancellor  of  the  Kingdom.  The  retaining 
of  his  lucrative  and  honorable  office  was  motive  suffi- 
cient to  induce  him  to  act  as  the  leader  of  the  enter- 
prise. He  was  equal  to  the  emergency.  "  To  obtain 
the  concurrence  of  the  principal  ministers  and  most 
powerful  persons  of  the  Reformed  party;  to  bring 
back  the  exiles,  and  to  restore  to  them  the  authority 
which  they  had  lost;  to  secure  the  support  of  Eliza- 
beth and  her  chief  ministers,  Cecil  and  Leicester;  to 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  H9 

murder  Rizzio;  to  dissolve  the  Parliament,  about  to 
be  convoked  for  the  purpose  of  legally  consummating 
the  ruin  of  the  fugitive  lords ;  to  imprison  the  Queen ; 
to  confer  the  nominal  sovereignty  upon  Darnley;  to 
replace  Murray  at  the  head  of  the  government:  such 
was  the  plan  conceived  by  Morton,  and  adopted  in 
Scotland  by  Lords  Lindsay,  Ruthven,  and  Lething- 
ton,  by  Knox  and  Craig,  the  two  ministers  of  Edin- 
burgh, Bellenden,  the  justice-clerk,  Makgill,  the 
clerk-register,  and  the  lairds  of  Brunston,  Calder,  and 
Ormiston.  The  Earl  of  Lennox  himself  proceeded  to 
England  to  communicate  it  to  Murray,  Rothes,  Glen- 
cairn,  Grange,  and  Ochiltree,  the  father-in-law  of 
Knox,  who  readily  embraced  it,  and  agreed  to  repair 
to  the  frontier,  so  as  to  be  ready  to  return  to  Edin- 
burgh as  soon  as  the  plot  had  succeeded." 

This  daring  and  comprehensive  conspiracy  was 
expressed  in  two  solemn  covenants,  embracing  both 
the  King  and  the  instruments  of  his  ambition.  The 
former  set  forth  Darnley's  determination  to  protect 
the  Queen's  honor,  by  seizing  the  abusers  of  her 
"  gentle  and  good  nature,"  and  with  the  assistance  of 
certain  of  the  nobility  and  others,  if  those  enemies  of 
the  realm  resisted,  "  to  cut  them  off  immediately, 
and  to  slay  them  wherever  it  happened."  The  King 
was  committed  to  the  defence  of  his  confederates  at 
all  hazards.  The  latter  obligation  bound  the  actors  in 
the  bloody  plot,  to  the  support  of  Darnley  in  his  am- 
bitious schemes  against  all  his  enemies. 

Randolph  and  Earl  of  Bedford  wrote  to  Elizabeth's 
secretary  on  the  6th  of  March,  1566,  a  full  and  most 
confidential  account  of  the  matured  conspiracy.  They 
said: 


120  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

•'  You  have  heard  of  divers  discords  and  jars  be- 
tween this  Queen  and  her  husband,  partly  for  that 
she  hath  refused  him  the  crown  matrimonial,  partly 
for  that  he  hath  assured  knowledge  of  such  usage  of 
herself,  as  altogether  is  intolerable  to  be  borne,  which 
if  it  were  not  ovenvell  known,  we  would  both  be  very 
loath  to  think  that  it  could  be  true.  To  take  away 
this  occasion  of  slander,  lie  is  liimsclf  determined  t&lt;» 
be  at  the  apprehension  and  execution  of  him  whom 
he  ia  able  manifestly  to  charge  with  the  crime,  and  to 
have  done  him  the  most  dishonor  that  can  be  to  any 
man,  much  more  being  as  he  i-. 

•         »•••••• 

"  If  persuasions  to  cause  the  Queen  to  yield  to 
these  matters  do  no  good,  they  propose  to  proceed 
we  know  not  in  what  sort.  If  she  be  able  to  make 
any  power  at  home,  she  shall  be  withstood,  and  her- 
self kept  from  all  other  counsel  than  her  own  nobility. 
If  she  seek  any  foreign  support,  the  Queen's  majesty, 
our  sovereign,  shall  be  sought,  and  sued  unto  to 
accept  his  and  their  defence,  with  offers  reasonable  to 
her  majesty's  contentment.  These  are  the  things 
which  we  thought  and  think  to  be  of  no  small  impor- 
tance; and  knowing  them  certainly  intended,  and  con- 
cluded upon,  thought  it  our  duties  to  utter  the  same 
to  you,  Mr.  Secretary,  to  make  declaration  thereof  as 
shall  seem  best  to  your  wisdom." 

Elizabeth  offered  no  opposition  to  the  intrigue. 
Mary  was  altogether  in  happy  ignorance  of  it.  Sh&lt; 
had  seen  the  disaffection  of  the  nobility  toward  Ilix- 
zio,  and  bitterly  reproached  them  for  a  selfish  refer- 
ence to  their  own  family  glory,  without  regard  to  her 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  121 

choice  of  "  a  man  of  low  estate,  poor  in  means,  but 
generous  in  mind,  faithful  in  heart,  and  well  adapted 
to  fill  an  office." 

The  general  fast  of  the  Reformed  church,  which 
had  commenced  March  third,  gathered  to  Edinburgh 
the  principal  clergy  and  laymen,  among  whom  Knox 
and  Craig  preached  on  topics  adapted  to  the  condi- 
tion of  affairs.  Oreb,  and  Zeeb,  and  Hainan,*  were 
held  up  as  examples  of  divine  justice  falling  upon  the 
heads  of.  guilty  princes  and  their  ungodly  favorites. 
The  conspirator  fixed  upon  Saturday  evening,  March 
9th,  for  the  closing  act  of  the  tragedy.  The  fatal  day 
dawned  and  waned  as  usual  in  tire  palace,  until  eight 
o'clock,  when  Darnley,  who  had  supped  earlier  than 
was  his  custom,  went  by  a  private  staircase  to  Mary's 
apartments,  when  she  was  at  tea  with  Lady  Argyle, 
her  sister,  her  brother,  Earl  of  Orkney,  Areskine, 
master  of  her  household,  her  physician,  and  Rizzio. 
The  court-yard  was  thronged  with  armed  men,  and 
the  shout  of  "  A  Douglas ! — a  Douglas !  "  reached  the 
Queen's  ears;  she  was  in  a  delicate  condition,  and 
trembled  with  alarm ;  but  before  she  could  ask  the 
cause  of  the  outcry,  Kuthven,  clad  in  a  suit  of  armor, 
and  ghastly  with  lingering  disease,  broke  into  the 
room.  Mary  recoiled  from  the  spectre;  the  dying 
conspirator  exclaimed : 

"  Let  it  please  your  majesty  that  yonder  man, 

*  Oreb  and  Zeeb  were  two  princes  of  Midian  who  were  slain 
by  the  Ephraimites  after  Gideon's  great  victory.  See  Judges 
vii  :  25.  Hainan  was  hung  upon  the  gallows  he  had  caused 
to  be  erected  for  the  execution  of  his  enemy,  Mordecai.  See 
Esther,  chapter  vii.  In  those  days  both  preachers  and  states- 
men were  much  given  to  justifying  their  ways  by  drawing 
historical  parallels  from  the  Old  Testament. 


122  MARY  QUEIN  OF  SCOTS. 

David,  come  forth  of  your  privy-chamber,  where  he 
hath  been  over  long." 

The  Queen  answered,  "  What  offence  hath  he 
done?" 

Ruthven  replied  "  that  he  made  a  greater  and  moro 
heinous  offence  to  her  majesty's  honor,  the  King  her 
husband,  the  nobility,  and  commonwealth." 

"  And  how  ?  "  said  she. 

"  If  it  would  please  your  majesty,  he  hath  offended 
your  honor,  which  I  dare  not  be  so  bold  as  to  speak 
of.  As  to  the  King  your  husband's  honor,  he  hath 
hindered  him  of  the  crown  matrimonial,  which  your 
grace  promised  him ;  besides  many  other  things  which 
are  not  necessary  to  be  expressed,  and  hath  caused 
your  majesty  to  banish  a  great  part  of  the  nobility, 
and  to  forfeit  them,  that  he  might  be  made  a  lord. 
And  to  your  commonwealth  he  hath  been  a  common 
destroyer,  hindering  your  majesty  to  grant  or  give 
anything  but  what  passed  through  his  hands,  by  tak- 
ing of  bribes  for  the  same ;  and  caused  your  majesty 
to  put  at  the  Lord  Ross  for  his  whole  land,  because  he 
would  not  give  over  the  lands  of  Melvin  to  the  said 
David,  besides  many  other  inconveniences  that  he 
solicited  your  majesty  to  do."  Then  the  Lord  Ruth- 
ven said  to  the  King,  ''  Sir,  take  the  Queen  your  wife 
and  sovereign  to  you,"  who  stood  all  amazed,  and 
know  not  what  to  do. 

"  Then  her  majesty  rose  upon  her  feet  and  stood 
before  David,  IIP  holding  her  majesty  by  the  plaits  of 
her  gown,  loaning  back  over  the  arch  of  the  window, 
his  dagger  drawn  in  liis  hand:  meanwhile,  Arthur 
Areskin,  and  the  Abbot  of  Holy  rood-House,  and  the 
Lord  Keith,  master  of  the  household,  with  the  French 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  123 

apothecary,  and  one  of  the  chamber,  began  to  lay 
hands  on  the  Lord  Ruthven,  none  of  the  King's  party 
being  there  present.  Then  the  said  Lord  Ruthven 
pulled  out  his  dagger,  and  defended  himself  until 
more  came  in,  and  said  to  them,  '  Lay  no  hands  on 
me,  for  I  will  not  be  handled.'  At  the  coming  in  of 
others  into  the  cabinet,  the  said  Lord  Ruthven  put 
up  his  dagger,  and  with  the  rushing  in  of  men,  the 
board  fell  into  the  wall,  meat  and  candles  being  there- 
on." 

Poor  Rizzio  cried  out  in  broken  language,  "  I  am 
killed !  "  begging  piteously  for  her  protection.  Amid 
the  awful  confusion,  during  which  the  Queen  fainted, 
the  terrified  secretary  was  dragged  through  Mary's 
bed-room  into  the  entrance  of  her  presence  chamber, 
where,  in  spite  of  Morton's  wish  to  keep  him  until  the 
next  day  and  hang  him,  George  Douglas,  seizing  the 
King's  dagger,  stabbed  him,  saying  loudly  that  it  was 
the  royal  blow.  His  comrades  rushed  on,  and  did  not 
leave  the  bleeding  form,  until  it  was  pierced  with 
fifty-six  wounds.*  The  body  was  thrown  out  of  the 
window  into  the  court-yard,  and  carried  to  the  por- 
ter's lodge.  Mary,  upon  regaining  her  self-possession, 
was  aware  from  circumstances  that  attended  the  mur- 
der, of  her  husband's  connection  with  it,  and  indig- 
nantly reproached  him  with  these  words :  "  My  Lord, 
why  have  you  caused  to  do  this  wicked  deed  to  me, 
considering  that  I  took  you  from  low  estate,  and  made 
you  my  husband ;  what  offence  have  I  given  you  that 
you  should  do  me  such  shame  ?  "  Ruthven  records 


*  Rizzio's  blood-stains  are  to  this  day  pointed  out  upon  the 
floor  of  Mary's  chamber  in  Holyrood  palace. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

that  he  replied  he  had  good  reason,  for  since  the  Ital- 
ian's familiarity  with  her,  she  had  not  "  regarded, 
entertained,  or  trusted  him  after  her  wonted  fash- 
ion." Mary  replied,  •'  My  Lord,  all  the  offence  that 
is  done  me,  you  have  the  wite  thereof,  for  the  which 
I  shall  be  your  wife  no  longer,  nor  lie  with  you  any 
more,  and  shall  never  like  well  till  I  cause  you  to  have 
as  sorrowful  a  heart  as  I  have  at  this  present." 

After  a  tumult  in  the  palace,  made  by  an  effort  to 
expel  the  King's  party,  Ruthven  left  'her  majesty's 
presence,  and  upon  his  return,  she  inquired  after  Riz- 
zio's  fate.  Receiving  no  direct  answer,  the  following 
conversation  took  place,  as  given  by  the  resolute  lord 
who  was  on  the  confines  of  the  grave : 

"  What  offence  or  default  have  I  committed,  to  be 
thus  treated  ? " 

"  Inquire  of  the  King,  your  husband." 

"  Nay,  I  will  inquire  of  you." 

"  Madam,  if  it  would  please  your  majesty  to  re- 
member, that  you  have  for  this  long  time,  a  number 
of  perverse  persons,  and  especially  one  David,  a 
stranger,  an  Italian,  who  ruled  and  guided  the  coun- 
try without  advice  of  the  nobility  and  council ;  and 
especially  against  those  peers  that  were  banished." 

"  Were  you  not  one  of  my  council  ?  Why  would 
von  not  declare,  if  I  did  aught  amiss?  " 

"  Because  your  majesty  would  not  listen,  in  all  the 
time  your  majesty  was  at  Dumfries,  but  whenever 
you  called  your  council  together,  did  things  by  your- 
self, and  your  privy  ]&gt;ersons:  albeit,  your  nobility  suf- 
fer the  pains  ami  expense." 

"  Well,  you  find  groat  fault  with  me;  I  will  lie 
content  to  set  down  my  crown  before  the  lords  of  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  125 

articles,*  and  if  they  find  that  I  have  offended,  to 
give  it  where  they  please." 

"  God  forbid,  madam ;  but  who  chose  the  said  lords 
of  the  articles  ?  " 

"Not  I." 

"  Saving  your  majesty's  reverence,  you  chose  them 
all  in  Seaton,  and  nominated  them ;  and  as  for  your 
majesty's  council,  it  hath  been  suffered  to  wait  full 
long:  and  what  was  done,  it  behooved  them  to  say  it- 
was  your  .majesty's  pleasure,  and  the  lords  of  the 
articles.  Your  majesty  first  chose  such  as  would  say 
whatsoever  you  thought ;  and  now,  when  the  lords  of 
the  articles  have  sitten  certain  days,  reasoning  if  they 
could  find  any  principal  cause  why  they  should  be 
forfeited  ?  Xo,  madam,  not  so  much  as  one  point, 
except  false  witness,  be  brought  against  them." 

Darnley  sent  forth  a  proclamation  to  the  magis- 
trates of  the  city,  that  Protestants  alone  should  be 
allowed  to  leave  their  houses;  and  the  next  day  dis- 
charged the  Parliament.  This  murder  deprived 
Mary  of  a  devoted  and  valuable  servant,  shook  her 
sceptre,  and  wounded  her  honor.  The  night  following 
was  one  of  extreme  agony.  The  pale  and  perfect 
features  of  the  beauty  were  bathed  in  tears  during  the 
silence  of  midnight,  while  the  victim  of  her  partiality 
was  in  a  dreamless  sleep,  "life's  fitful  fever"  over. 
Mary,  virtually  a  prisoner  in  her  palace  had  entered 

*  The  Lords  of  Articles  prepared  all  the  matters  which  were 
to  be  laid  before  Parliament ;  and  they  not  only  directed  its 
proceedings,  but  possessed  a  negative  before  debate.  It  should 
be  remembered  that  a  Scottish  Parliament  consisted  of  great 
barons,  ecclesiastics,  and  a  few  representatives  of  boroughs  ; 
they  composed  but  one  Assembly,  over  which  the  Lord  Chan- 
cellor presided, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

i In-  penumbra  of  the  total  eclipse,  which,  with  delu- 
sive prelude  of  brightness,  would  soon  bring  "  the 
days  of  darkness." 

Ruthven's  savage  manner  awakened  Mary's  fears 
for  her  own  safety.  (JnexpectecUj  seeing  Molvil,  she 
desired  him  to  apprize  Murray  that  he  would  be 
freely  pardoned,  on  the  condition  of  protecting  her 
life  and  liberty. 

The  Earls  of  Huntley  and  Bothwell,  hearing  of 
Murray's  expected  return,  and  apprehending  danger 
to  themselves,  escaped  from  the  windows  of  the  palace 
by  means  of  a  cord,  which  let  them  down  into  the  open 
fields.  Other  lords  who  were  at  Holyrood  followed 
the  example,  and  fled.  Mary  placed  her  hope  of  de- 
liverance mainly  in  Darnley,  who  at  length  sought 
her  presence.  Finding  her  calm  amid  all  the  fierce 
agitation  around  her,  he  related  the  particulars  of  the 
successful  conspiracy.  The  following  is  the  Queen's 
record  of  the  closing  scenes  described : 

"  After  this  deed,  the  said  Lord  Ruthven,  coming 
again  in  our  presence,  declared  how  they  and  their 
accomplices  were  highly  offended  with  our  proceed- 
ings and  tyranny,  which  was  not  to  them  tolerable; 
huw  he  was  abused  by  the  said  David,  whom  they  had 
actually  put  to  death;  namely,  in  taking  his  counsel 
rW  nuiintenance  of  the  ancient  religion;  debarring 
ih&lt;&gt;  lords  who  were  fugitive,  and  entertaining  amity 
with  foreign  princes;  putting,  also,  upon  counsel  the 
Lords  I&gt;othwcll  and  Huntley,  who  were  traitors,  and 
with  whom  he  associated  himself;  that  the  lords  ban- 
ished in  England  were  that  morn  to  resort  to  us,  and 
would  take  plain  part  with  them  in  our  controversy, 
ami  that  the  King  was  willing  to  remit  them  their  of- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  127 

fences.  We  all  this  time  took  no  less  care  of  our- 
selves, than  for  our  council  and  nobility,  to  wit,  the 
Earls  Huntley,  Bothwell,  Athol,  Lords  Fleming  and 
Livingston,  Sir  James  Balfour,  and  certain  others, 
our  familiar  servitors,  against  whom  the  enterprise 
was  conspier,  as  well  as  for  David :  and,  namely,  to 
have  hanged  Sir  James;  yet,  by  the  providence  of 
God,  the  Earls  of  Bothwell  and  Huntley  escaped  at  a 
back  window  by  some  cords;  the  conspirators  took 
some  fear,  and  thought  themselves  disappointed  in 
their  enterprise.  The  Earl  of  Athol  and  Sir  James 
Balfour,  by  some  other  means,  with  the  Lords  Flem- 
ing and  Livingston,  obtained  deliverance.  The  pro- 
vost and  town  of  Edinburgh  having  understood  this 
tumult  in  our  palace,  caused  to  ring  their  common 
bell,  came  to  us  in  great  number,  and  desired  to  have 
seen  our  presence,  and  communed  with  us;  and  to 
have  known  our  welfare ;  to  whom  we  were  not  per- 
mitted to  give  answer,  being  extremely  boasted  by 
their  lords,  who  in  our  face  declared,  if  we  desired  to 
have  spoken  them,  they  should  cut  us  in  collops,  and 
cast  us  over  the  walls.  Our  brother,  the  Earl  of  Mur- 
ray, that  same  day  at  even,  accompanied  by  the  Earl 
of  Rothes,  Pitarrow,  Grange,  and  others,  came  to  us, 
and  seeing  our  state,  was  moved  with  natural  affec- 
tion towards,  us ;  upon  the  morn  he  assembled  the  en- 
terprizers  of  the  late  crime,  and  such  of  our  rebels  as 
came  with  him.  In  their  council  they  thought  it  most 
expedient  that  we  should  be  warded  in  our  Castle  of 
Stirling,  there  to  remain  till  we  had  approved,  in 
Parliament,  all  their  wicked  enterprizes,  established 
their  religion,  and  given  to  the  King  the  crown  mat- 
rimonial and  the  whole  government  of  our  realm,  or 


128  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

ol-e  by  all  appearance  prepared  to  put  us  to  death,  or 
detain  us  in  perpetual  captivity." 

When  Murray  entered  Mary's  apartment,  she  em- 
braced him,  nnd  weeping,  said,  "  Had  you  been  here, 
I  should  not  have  boon  so  treated."  lie  was  moved  to 
tears,  and  taking  lior  arm,  \vhilo  Darnley  walked  also 
in  company,  she  discoursed  of  her  sorrows.  Of  tho 
^esult  of  an  interview  with  the  apparently  repentant 
King,  she  writes:  '•  We  declared  our  state  to  the 
King,  our  husband,  certifying  him  how  miserably  lie 
would  IK»  handled  if  he  permitted  the  lords  to  prevail : 
and  how  unacceptable  it  would  be  to  other  princes, 
our  confederates,  in  case  he  altered  the  religion.  By 
this  persuasion  he  was  induced  to  condescend  to  the 
purpose  taken  by  us,  and  to  retire  to  Dunbar.  We 
being  minded  to  have  gotten  ourselves  relieved  of  this 
detention,  desired  Earls  of  Bothwell  and  Hunt  ley  to 
have  prepared  some  way  whereby  we  might  have  es- 
caped ;  who,  not  doubting  therein  at  least,  taking  no 
ird  to  hazard  their  lives  in  that  behalf,  desired 
that  we  should  have  come  over  the  walls  of  our  palace 
in  the  night,  upon  chairs,  which  they  had  in  readiness 
to  that  effect  soon  after." 

Thus,  Darnley,  after  having  opened  the  series  of 
royal  treacheries  and  scenes  of  bloodshed,  and  grasped 
the  reins  of  authority,  in  his  weakness,  yielded  to  the 
^ri«-f  of  the  fascinating  captive.  With  mutual  con- 
ions,  harnley  was  reconciled,  the  Queen  forgiv- 
ing, and  the  conspirators  abandoned.  His  next  move 
was  to  effort  her  escape.  He  informed  his  devoted 
a— oriates  that  the  Queen  was  attacked  with  a  fever, 
which  required  u  change  of  air;  at  the  same  t-ime  ex- 
pressing her  readiness  to  pardon  them  for  past  of- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  129 

fences.  They  were  suspicious  of  the  design,  and  cau- 
tioned Darnley.  But  he  repeated  his  confidence  in 
her  honor.  She  wished  them  to  prepare  articles  of 
security,  which  she  would  sign.  Having  no  better  al- 
ternative, they  complied ;  and  at  midnight,  March 
llth,  Mary  Stuart,  Darnley,  and  Arthur  Erskine, 
her  captain  of  the  guard,  fled  from  Holyrood,  and 
dashed  away  on  fleet  horses  to  the  Castle  of  Dunbar. 
It  was  an  ominous  night;  that  Queen,  her  subdued 
yet  haughty  husband,  and  a  single  guard,  flying  in  the 
stillness  and  gloom  of  night  from  the  walls,  within 
which  stood  a  vacant  throne ! 

Upon  her  arrival  at  Dunbar,  she  issued  the  sum- 
mons to  her  nobility  to  meet  her  arms.  The  conspir- 
ators had  discovered  that  the  articles  of  safety  were 
left  without  her  signature,  and  dispatched  Lord  Tem- 
ple to  demand  a  fulfillment  of  her  pledge.  He  waited 
three  days  for  an  answer,  during  which  she  had  as- 
sembled an  army  collected  by  Both  well,  Huntley,  and 
others.  On  the  16th  she  issued  a  proclamation,  de- 
nouncing the  leaders  in  the  late  sanguinary  transac- 
tions, and  to  strengthen  her  cause,  conciliated  Mur- 
ray, Argyle,  Glencairn  and  Rothes,  on  condition  of 
refusing  any  sympathy  with  the  murderers  of  the 
secretary.  The  objects  of  her  hate,  the  hunted  rebels, 
were  Morton,  Ruthven,  Lindsay,  George  Douglas, 
Andrew  Ker  of  Fandonside,  and  sixty -five  other 
lairds  or  gentlemen,  whom  she  ordered  to  appear,  and 
answer  for  their  crime.  She  then  marched  upon  the 
capital,  where  they  were.  On  her  approach,  they 
escaped  to  England,  and  she  once  more  entered  the 
city  of  an  outrage,  which  had  kindled  a  glow  of  ven- 
geance in  her  passionate  heart.  The  Earl  of  Lennox

was  forbidden  to  appear  at  her  court ;  Tx&gt;thington  was 
deprived  of  office;  Joseph  Rizzio,  brother  of  David, 
was  appointed  private  secretary ;  honors  were  paid  to 
the  dead  ;  and  the  accessories  of  the  murder,  guards  of 
the  gates,  and  other  subalterns,  were  condemned  to 
death.  Her  intense  fervor  of  revenge  reached  some 
who  were  wholly  unconnected  with  the  assassination. 
Darnley  was  compelled  to  deny  any  interest  in  the 
conspiracy,  by  a  public  declaration,  in  which  he 
speaks  of  the  wicked  persons  who  had  implicated  him 
in  "  the  late  cruel  murder,  committed  in  presence  of 
the  Queen's  majesty,  and  treasonable  detaining  of  her 
majesty's  most  noble  person  in  captivity."  "  His 
grace,"  he  added,  "  for  the  removing  of  the  evil  opin- 
ion which  the  good  subjects  may  be  induced  to  con- 
ceive, through  such  false  reports  and  seditious  rumors, 
hath,  as  well  to  the  Queen's  majesty  as  in  the  presence 
of  the  lords  of  secret  council,  plainly  declared  upon 
his  honor,  fidelity,  and  the  word  of  a  prince,  that  he 
never  knew  of  any  part  of  the  said  treasonable  con- 
spiracy whereof  he  is  slanderously  and  falsely  ac- 
cused, nor  never  counseled,  commanded,  consented, 
assisted,  nor  approved  the  same." 

His  accomplices  were  naturally  enough  fired  with 
indignation  at  his  treachery.  To  have  incited  them 
to  hazard  all  for  the  augmenting  of  his  power,  and  to 
gratify  his  jealousy,  and  then  to  betray  them  coolly  to 
the  wrath  of  the  injured  sovereign,  was  treason  below 
the  ambition  of  a  demon.  They  turned  upon  the 
traitor,  by  transmitting  to  Mary  the  bonds  which  he 
had  signed,  in  contemplation  of  securing  the  matri- 
monial crown,  and  dispatching  Rizzio.  These  cove- 
nants dispelled  all  doubt  on  the  Queen's  mind  re- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  131 

specting  the  deliberate,  premeditated  guilt  of  her  hus- 
band, and  opened  an  impassable  gulf  of  alienation 
and  disgust  between  her  and  himself.  She  despised 
him  as  a  conspirator,  a  coward,  and  a  liar. 

Melvil  records  in  his  memoirs :  "  The  Queen  la- 
mented unto  me  the  King's  folly,  ingratitude,  and 
misbehavior ;  I  excused  the  same  the  best  I  could,  im- 
puting it  to  his  youth,  which  occasioned  him  to  be 
easily  led  away  by  pernicious  counsel,  laying  the 
blame  upon  George  Douglas,  and  other  bad  counsel- 
lors ;  praying  her  majesty,  for  many  necessary  con- 
siderations, to  remove  out  of  her  mind  any  prejudice 
against  him,  seeing  that  she  had  chosen  him  herself 
against  the  opinion  of  many  of  her  subjects.  But  I 
could  perceive  nothing  from  that  day  forth  but  great 
grudges  that  she  entertained  in  her  heart." 

Mary's  hatred  to  Darnley  appeared  in  gradually 
excluding  him  from  all  participation  in  public  affairs, 
and  entrusting  responsible  offices  to  Earls  of  Both  well, 
Huntley,  Athol,  and  the  Bishop  of  Ross ;  transferring 
with  undissembled  designs,  his  honors  and  powers  to 
her  favorites. 

As  the  time  of  her  confinement  approached,  the 
Queen,  suspicious,  because  of  former  plots  against 
her,  that  unexpected  advantage  might  be  taken  of  her 
condition,  removed  to  Stirling  Castle,  where,  while 
a  child,  she  had  been  crowned,  and  where  she  was 
about  to  become  a  mother — a  responsibility  and 
honor,  transcending  the  diadem  of  royalty.  On  the 
19th  of  June,  1566,  between  nine  and  ten  o'clock  in 
the  morning,  was  born  a  son,  whose  brow  was  destined 
to  wear  the  united  crowns  of  the  rival  sovereigns.*

Melvil  was  immediately  di.-patehed  to  Elizabeth,  to 
announce  the  event,  and  request  her  "to  act  as  god- 
mother to  the  Prince  of  Scotland."  The  Knglish 
Queen  was  in  the  midst  of  a  magnificent  hall,  which 
she  had  given  to  her  court  at  Greenwich,  when  ( Veil, 
secretary  of  state,  entered  the  crowded  and  brilliant 
ball.  She  was  daneing  when  he  whispered  the  tidings 
,  in  her  ear.  A  shade  passed,  like  a  storm-cloud  over 
the  landscape,  across  her  flushed  and  kindling  feat- 
ures. The  magic  whirl  suddenly  ceased,  and  sinking 
with  a  sigh  into  an  arm-chair,  she  said  to  the  ladies 
near  her  person,  "  that  the  Queen  of  Scots  was  mother 
to  a  fair  son,  while  she  was  but  a  barren  stock."  She 
soon  regained  her  accustomed  self-control,  and  the  fol- 
lowing day  she  received  Melvil  with  a  smile,  express- 
ing joy  at  the  advent  of  a  prince,  and  thanking  him 
for  bringing  her  the  pleasing  intelligence.  She  also 
assured  him,  that  she  "  gladly  condescended  to  be  a 
gossip  to  the  Queen." 

"  She  immediately  sent  Sir  Henry  Killegrew  to 
congratulate  the  Queen  of  Scotland  on  her  behalf,  to 
assure  her  of  her  friendship,  and  to  express  her  ap- 
probation of  her  conduct  towards  Ilizzio's  murderers, 
whom  she  had  nevertheless  granted  an  asylum  in  her 
dominions." 

Darnley  wrote  the  following  letter,  upon  the  birth 
of  his  son : 

KING    HENRY   DARNLEY   TO    MONSIEUR   THE   CARDINAL, 
DE  GUISE. 

"FROM  THE  CASTLE  OF  EDINBURGH,  this  10th 
day  of  June,  1506,  in  great  ha.-te. 

"Sir,  my  uncle:  having  so  favorable  an  opportu- 
nity of  writing  to  y..u  by  thi?  gentlemen,  who  is  oil  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  133 

point  of  setting  off,  I  would  not  omit  to  inform  you 
that  the  Queen,  my  wife,  has  just  been  delivered  of  a 
son;  which  circumstance,  I  am  sure,  will  not  cause 
you  less  joy  than  ourselves;  and  also  to  inform  you 
how,  on  this  occasion,  I  have,  on  my  part,  as  the 
Queen  my  said  wife,  has  also  on  hers,  written  to  the 
king,  begging  him  to  be  pleased  to  oblige  and  honor 
us  by  standing  sponsor  for  him,  by  which  means  he 
will  increase  the  debt  of  gratitude  I  owe  him  for  all 
his  favors- to  me,  for  which  I  shall  always  be  ready 
to  make  every  return  in  my  power. 

"  So  having  nothing  more  agreeable  to  inform  you 
of  at  present,  I  conclude,  praying  God,  monsieur,  my 
uncle,  to  have  you  always  in  his  holy  and  worthy 
keeping. 

"  Your  very  humble  and  very  obd't  nephew, 

"  HENRY  E." 

The  message  of  instructions  from  Charles  IX.  of 
France,  to  his  special  messenger  to  the  Queen  of  Scot- 
land, throws  light  on  the  passing  events : 

INSTRUCTIONS  GIVEN  TO  THE  SR!  DE  MAUVISSIERE  * 
ON  A  MISSION  FROM  THE  KING  OF  FRANCE  TO  SCOT- 
LAND. 

"  The  Sr.  de  Mauvissiere,  whom  the  king  is  now 
sending  to  Scotland,  will,  on  passing  through  Eng- 
land, wait  upon  the  Sr.  de  la  Forest,  his  ambassador, 
and  accompany  him,  to  present  to  the  Queen  of  the

employed  in  diplomatic  missions,  and  was  in  1575  appointed 
French  ambassador  in  London,  which  post  he  held  for  six 
years.

aforesaid  England  tin-  Idlers  which  their  majesties 
have  written  to  her;  ami  -uv  that,  having  sent  him 
to  Scotland,  it  is  their  wish  that,  in  passing  through 
the  kingdom,  he  should  wait  upon  her,  and  present  in 
their  names,  their  most  affectionate  respects  from  the 
desire  they  have  not  to  omit  toward  her  anything  that 
mutual  friendship  demands;  and  which  their  majes- 
ties wish  not  only  to  perpetuate,  but  to  augment  by 
all  the  means  possible,  as  well  as  by  every  act  of  kind- 
ness. And,  at  the  same  time,  the  said  Sieur  de  Mau- 
vissiere  will  assure  the  said  lady,  that  the  perfect 
friendship  the  king  bears  her  is  so  strong  and  so  sin- 
cere, that  all  the  concern  and  affairs  of  the  said  lady 
interest  him  as  much  as  his  own,  and  that  he  ardently 
desires  to  prove  the  sincerity  of  his  affection,  rather 
by  deeds  than  by  words. 

"  That  the  reason  for  which  he  is  going  to  Scotland 
is  to  congratulate,  in  the  name  of  their  majesties,  the 
said  Queen  of  the  aforesaid  Scotland,  on  her  happy 
delivery,  and  that  God  has  given  her  a  son,  which 
news  was  very  agreeable  to  them,  as  they  also  pre- 
sume that  it  will  have  given  the  greatest  joy  to  the 
said  lady. 

"  That  his  stay  will  be  so  short,  that,  if  it  please  the 
said  lady,  to  commission  him  to  say  anything  on  her 
part  to  the  Queen  of  Scotland,  he  will  deliver  the  mes- 
sage faithfully,  and  bring  her  an  answer  in  a  few 
days. 

"  Having  performed  the  above  duty  to  the  said 
Queen  of  England,  he  will  see  the  Duke  (earl)  of  Lei- 
cester, and  say  to  him  that  their  majesties  continuing 
to  entertain  for  him  the  same  good-will  they  have  al- 
ways hitherto  done,  it  is  their  wish  that  Sr.  de  la 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  135 

Forest  should  assist  him  in  every  way  he  can  in  re- 
gard to  his  marriage,  and  to  make  such  offers  as  he 
will  repeat,  of  which  the  duke  will  judge  if  they  can 
be  useful  to  him,  or  in  any  way  facilitate  and  promote 
the  conclusion  of  it ;  and  that,  if  it  be  agreeable  to  him 
to  make  known  his  intentions  to  the  said  Sr.  de  la 
Forest,  or  the  Sieur  de  Trochmortin,  D.  Guillerey,  or 
any  other  whom  he  may  think  proper,  he  will  find  that 
they  will  proceed  more  expeditiously  than  the  Sieur 
de  Foix,  his  predecessor ;  having  been  commanded  so 
to  do  by  their  majesties,  who  desire  that  the  Sieur  de 
la  Forest  will  inform  them  of  this  in  his  own  name, 
and  contract  the  closest  private  familiarity  with  the 
said  Sieur  de  Trochmortin,  Guillerey,  or  any  other 
whom  the  duke  may  choose  to  employ,  to  procure  him 
information,  and  assist  him  in  the  prosecution  of  his 
undertaking  in  such  manner  as  the  said  duke  may 
intimate  that  he  has  occasion  for.  That  the  said  Sr. 
de  Mauvissiere,  on  arriving  in  Scotland,  shall  first 
visit  the  Queen  of  that  kingdom,  and  after  delivering 
to  her  the  letters  of  their  majesties  and  their  affec- 
tionate remembrances,  he  is  to  congratulate  her  on 
her  happy  delivery,  and  its  having  pleased  God  to 
give  her  a  son,  assuring  her  their  majesties  received 
the  news  with  the  greatest  joy,  and  will  be  still  hap- 
pier to  learn  that  the  mother  and  infant  are  as  well  as 
can  be  desired. 

"  Besides  he  has  letters  to  the  King,  her  husband, 
to  express  the  like  congratulation  to  him,  but  also 
with  the  express  command  not  to  do  anything  in  this 
matter  but  what  the  said  lady  should  think  fit,  and  to 
use  such  language  to  him  as  she  may  deem  proper  and 
order. 


136  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

&lt;;  That  he  has  also  letters  of  introduction  to  differ- 
ent gentlemen  of  that  country ;  that  if  the  said  lady 
considers  it  serviceable  to  her  that  he  should  hold  any 
language  to  them  on  the  part  of  their  majesties,  he 
must  do  so;  being,  when  all  is  said,  expressly  com- 
manded to  do  nothing  but  by  her  advice,  and  conduct 
himself,  in  all  respects,  as  may  be  for  the  interest  of 
her  affairs,  according  as  she  may  direct  him. 

"  And  if,  inasmuch  as  the  said  Sieur  de  Mauvis- 
siere  says  he  thinks  the  said  Queen  of  Scotland  will 
ask  what  assurance  he  brings  her  of  the  assistance  she 
is  to  expect  from  the  king  in  her  affairs,  in  men  or 
money,  if  the  said  lady  should  speak  to  him  on  this 
subject,  he  is  to  reply  as  follows : 

"  That  monsieur  the  Cardinal  of  Lorraine,  having 
acquainted  their  majesties  that  the  said  lady  had  need 
of  money,  and  seeing  that,  from  the  state  of  his  finan- 
ces, he  could  not  spare  any  of  his  own,  had  begged 
their  majesties  to  furnish  him  with  the  sixty  thou- 
sand livres  *  which  were  due  of  his  pension,  and 
which  their  said  majesties  would  have  done  most  will- 
ingly; but  there  not  being  sufficient  ready  money  in 
the  hands  of  the  treasurer  to  furnish  him  with  the 
said  sum,  the  said  treasurer  had  rendered  himself  re- 
sponsible in  his  own  private  name  toward  those  from 
whom  the  said  sieur  the  cardinal  should  obtain  the 
said  sum,  which  their  majesties  think  that  he  would 
not  fail  to  remit  to  the  said  lady,  knowing  she  had 
need  of  it.  And  the  said  lady  must  not  doubt,  that  if 
his  majesty  had  had  as  much  money  at  his  command 
as  good-will  to  assist  the  said  lady,  she  would  always 
find  his  purse  open  and  at  her  service. 

*  The  livre  was  worth  19$  cents. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  137 

"  As  to  sending  succors  in  men,  their  majesties 
have  been  informed  from  various  sources,  that  the  af- 
fairs of  her  kingdom  are  at  present  in  such  a  state  of 
peace  and  tranquillity  as  not  to  require  it,  and  that 
she,  to  whom  God  had  given  so  fine  and  promising  an 
heir,  is  so  much  revered  and  obeyed,  that  they  think 
her  most  important  object  will  be  to  reconcile  her  sub- 
jects to  each  other,  if  there  yet  remains  any  enmity 
among  them  on  account  of  the  past,  and  to  preserve 
peace  and  tranquillity  in  her  dominions ;  and  for  this 
reason  they  have  not  thought  it  necessary  to  give  any 
instructions  on  this  head  to  the  Sieur  de  Mauvissiere, 
that  on  his  return  he  may  be  able  to  report  the  same 
to  their  said  majesties,  who  will  always  do,  in  favor 
and  for  the  assistance  of  the  said  lady,  whatever  she 
can  promise  herself  and  expect  from  princes,  who  are 
her  best  and  most  sincere  friends  in  this  world. 

"  His  majesty  is  much  gratified  by  the  favor  which 
the  said  lady  has  done  him,  by  having  chosen  him  as 
one  of  his  sponsors ;  and,  being  desirous  of  gratifying 
and  obliging  her  to  the  utmost  of  his  power,  begs  her 
to  inform  him  which  of  the  princes  of  his  kingdom  or 
other  seigneurs  will  be  most  agreeable  to  her  to  hold 
her  son  at  the  holy  font  of  baptism  in  his  name;  as 
the  one  whom  she  may  name  and  select,  his  majesty 
will  immediately  dispatch  on  receiving  from  her  this 
information." 

Mary  looked  upon  her  first-born  with  more  than 
maternal  affection ;  ambitious  hopes  gave  a  glow  of 
intense  interest  to  her  pale  and  beautiful  face.  The 
subjection  of  foes,  and  the  right  of  succession  in  Eng- 
land, were  associated  with  the  earliest  glance  of  the 


138  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

infant's  wandering  eye.  She  little  thought  that  her 
idol  would  cost  her  a  throne,  and  as  a  result,  tears 
numberless  as  the  drops  of  morning  dew. 

The  education  of  the  prince  was  a  question  of  im- 
mediate concern.  The  Protestant  leaders  -  assembled 
in  the  High  *  Church  to  offer  public  thanksgiving  for 
the  Queen's  safety,  and  resolved  to  urge  that  her  .«-n 
should  be  nurtured  in  the  evangelical  faith. 

"  For  this  purpose  a  congratulatory  deputation 
from  the  General  Assembly,  headed  by  the  superin- 
tendent of  Lothian,  communicated  to  the  Queen  the 
prayers  of  her  subjects,  that  she  would  be  graciously 
pleased  to  allow  their  prince  to  be  reared  in  the  true 
faith.  Unfortunately  for  Mary,  she  discovered  not 
how  much  it  imported,  even  to  her  personal  safety,  to 
acquiesce  in  this  demand ; — more  unfortunately  still, 
she  allowed  herself  to  believe,  that  both  in  Scotland 
and  England,  the  ancient  worship  was  ultimately  to 
be  restored.  In  each  country  the  number  of  Catholics 
had  lately  increased,  and  she  well  knew  that  in 
France,  Spain,  and  Italy,  a  league  existed  for  the  ex- 
tirpation of  heretical  principles.  With  these  internal 
convictions,  Mary  scrupulously  abstained  from  a 
promise,  not  only  revolting  to  her  conscience,  but  in- 
compatible with  her  foreign  engagements;  unwilling, 
however,  at  such  a  moment,  to  cause  displeasure  to  her 
subject-.  &gt;lie  ordered  the  infant  prince  to  be  presented 
to  the  deputies,  and  with  her  wonted  grace,  placedhim 
in  the  jtnus  of  the  superintendent.  Charmed  with 
tlii-  affability,  the  minister  uttered  a  prayer  for  the 

*  St.  Giles' was  in  common  speech  known  as  High  Church. 
It  is  situated  at  the  head  of  Highstreet,  near  the  castle  which 
crowns  the  hill. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  139 

babe's  future  honor  and  prosperity,  and,  at  the  con- 
clusion, extorted  from  the  child  a  certain  responsive 
murmur,  to  signify  that  he  pronounced,  Amen. 
Mary,  now  in  her  turn  delighted,  with  genuine  ex- 
pressions of  maternal  fondness,  thanked  the  minis- 
ter, sportively  calling  him  good  Mr.  Amen,  an  appel- 
1  lation  by  which  he  was  ever  after  distinguished." 

The  exciting  question  of  the  succession  was  again 
revived,  according  to  Mary's  orders,  by  Melvil,  who 
addressed  Elizabeth  on  the  subject.  The  Queen  of 
Scotland  effected  a  union  between  Murray,  Argyle, 
and  Lethington,  to  secure  the  influence  of  the  Protes- 
tant party  in  England ;  while  the  same  policy  brought 
together  Bothwell,  Huntley,  Athol,  and  the  Bishop  of 
Ross,  to  control  the*  Catholic  power,  in  the  attain- 
ment of  her  cherished  and  growing  aspirations.  In 
the  midst  of  those  reconciliations  and  favorable  nego- 
tiations with  the  lairds,  who  led  the  Presbyterian 
body,  the  radical  Catholics  interposed,  by  a  foolish 
claim  of  Elizabeth's  sceptre  in  Mary's  behalf. 

Patrick  Adamson,  a  Scotchman,  published  in  Paris 
a  Latin  work,  in  which  she  was  called  Queen  of  Eng- 
land, and  her  son,  Prince  of  Scotland,  England  and 
Ireland.  This  fully  aroused  Elizabeth.  Parliament, 
which  had  been  debating  the  transmission  of  the 
crown  for  several  days,  she  summoned  before  her, 
and  with  a  stern  rebuke,  unfolded  the  dangers  of  ap- 
pointing a  successor  beforehand,  with  these  words: 
"  I  am  your  natural  Queen,  and  although  you  show 
yourselves  so  adverse  to  my  will  in  this  affair,  I  will 
not  consent  to  its  being  carried  farther."  The  lower 
house  still  persisted  in  the  discussion,  until  Elizabeth 
commanded  peremptorily  a  cessation  of  further  con-

sidcration  of  the  unpleasant  and  hopeless  question. 
Referring  angrily  to  Adamson's  volume,  in  a  mes- 
Uge  to  Mary,  she  said :  "  You  know,  madam,  that 
there  is  nothing  in  the  world  which  so  much  concerns 
my  honor  as  that  there  should  be  no  other  Queen  of 
England  hut  myself." 

This  unsettled  condition  of  rival  claims  continued, 
while  Mary  entered  on  a  more  dangerous  experiment. 
James  Hepburn,  tjie  Earl  of  Bothwell,  was  a  daring, 
impetuous,  and  dangerous  man.  The  owner  of  large 
estates — by  marriage  he  had  united  one  of  the  most 
influential  families  of  the  South,  with  the  most  pow- 
erful family  in  the  Xorth  of  Scotland.  Lady  Jane 
Gordon  had  been  his  bride  but  a  few  months,  when, 
during  the  summer  of  1560,  Mary  Stuart  cherished  a 
fatal  passion  for  the  earl.  Unblushing  in  his  vices, 
and  fearless  in  his  wildest  schemes,  his  heroism  and 
bold  ambition  won  the  admiration  of  Mary,  who  felt 
burdened  by  the  presence  of  the  weak  and  unreliable 
Darnley.  Bothwell  aimed  to  secure  her  affection  and 
share  her  sovereignty.  He  was  chivalrous,  though 
neither  handsome  nor  truly  refined ;  and  to  an  ardent 
woman,  his  dashing  independence  and  extravagant 
devotion  were  qualities  that  obscured  the  vices  of 
dissipation,  and  unscrupulous  plans  of  personal  eleva- 
tion. The  Queen,  before  she  was  aware,  was  an  un- 
resisting victim  of  his  fascinating  power.  His  in- 
fluence over  her,  and  in  the  court,  alarmed  the  youth- 
ful King,  and  he  began  to  look  for  a  protecting  party. 
He  sought  to  enlist  the  Catholic  church,  and  wrote 
the  Pope,  charging  the  Queen  with  indifference  to 
the  progress  of  the  ancient  faith.  In  an  excursion  to 
Alloa,  on  the  banks  of  the  Forth,  it  is  recorded,  that 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

upon  the  restoration  to  Mary's  favor  of  the  Laird 
of  Lethington,  on  that  occasion,  Darnley,  who  hated 
him,  in  a  passion  left  the  party  and  hastened  to  Edin-  * 
burgh.  Mary  soon  followed  to  meet  Mauvissiere, 
who  had  arrived  from  France  with  the  congratulatory 
message  from  Charles  IX.  The  ambassador  acted  as 
mediator,  and  apparently  succeeded  in  making  a  rec- 
onciliation between  the  alienated  parties.  For  sev: 
eral  weel^s  civility  and  tranquillity  marked  their 
intercourse.  Darnley  accompanied  the  Queen  and 
ladies  of  the  palace,  in  a  tour  to  the  Western  High- 
lands, but  before  the  royal  expedition  closed,  he  be- 
came more  irritable  and  insulting  than  at  any  former 
period.  Mary's  female  companions  did  not  escape 
the  ebullitions  of  his  anger.  He  finally  withdrew  to 
a  private  house,  and  refused  decidedly  to  attend  Mary 
to  the  capital.  In  his  melancholy  musings  he  resolved 
to  abandon  his  country,  and  wander,  self-exiled,  a  des- 
olate and  neglected  being,  who  could  publish,  with 
the  sympathy  of  all,  the  story  of  his  wrongs.  This 
was  revenge  that  lie  knew  would  wound  the  Queen 
deeply;  her  pride  and  sensibility  would  be  keenly 
stung.  A  ship  was  ready  to  convey  him  to  France, 
when  his  father  visited  him  and  wrote  immediately 
to  Mary  Stuart  at  Edinburgh,  to  communicate  her 
husband's  intention,  and  his  own  inability  to  change 
the  King's  purpose. 

The  same  day  that  she  received  the  letter  of  the 
Earl  of  Lennox,  awakening  the  apprehension  that 
Darnley  had  already  sailed  from  Scotland,  he  arrived 
at  Holyrood.  His  vacillating  nature  had  dismissed 
the  desperate  design  of  a  departure,  for  the  endeavor 
to  renew  confidence  and  harmony  with  Mary.  She

at  once  assembled  her  council,  invited  the  French  am

tion was  demanded  &lt;&gt;f  the  King,  of  his  strange  plans, 
harnley  was  taken  by  surprise,  for,  instead  of  an 
amicable  settlement  of  difficulties,  he  was  brought  to 
the  tribunal  of  accusation  and  inquiry.  To  the  ques- 
tioning of  the  lords  he  wa-  silent.  I)e  Croc  assureil 
him  his  projected  voyage  and  absence  involved  the 
Queen's  honor  and  his  own,  and  urged  him  to  give 
his  reasons  for  so  dangerous  a  resolve.  He  at  length 
replied,  that  Mary  had  given  him  no  occasion;  which 
was  all  that  she  desired.  Whether  he  remained  in 
the  realm  or  not,  she,  before  competent  witnesses, 
was  acquitted  by  his  own  confession.  She  therefore 
said,  "  she  was  satisfied"  The  following  passages 
are  quoted  from  a  letter  of  the  council  to  the  queen - 
mother  of  France,  supposed  to  be  from  the  pen  of 
M  ait  land,  which  detail  the  interview  with  Darnley: 

*•'  About  ten  or  twelve  days  ago,  the  Queen,  at  our 
request,  came  to  this  town  of  Lisleburg  (Edinburgh). 
Her  maje.-ty  was  desirous  the  King  should  have  come 
with  her,  but  because  he  liked  to  remain  at  Stirling, 
and  wait  her  return  thither,  she  left  him  there,  with 
an  intention  to  go  towards  him  in  five  or  six  day-: 
meantime,  whilst  the  Queen  was  absent,  the  Earl  of 
Lennox,  his  father,  came  to  visit  him  in  Stirling,  and 
having  remained  with  him  two  or  three  days,  he  went 
his  way  to  Gla-uow,  the  ordinary  place  of  his  abode; 
from  Glasgow  my  Lord  of  Lennox  wrote  to  the 
Queen,  and  acquainted  her  Majesty,  that  though  for- 
merly, both  by  letters  and  UK  s -ages,  and  now  also  by 
communication  with  his  son,  he  endeavored  to  divert 
him  from  an  enterprise  he  had  in  view,  he  neverthe- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  143 

less  had  not  the  interest  to  alter  his  mind.  This  pro- 
ject he  tells  the  Queen,  was  to  retire  out  of  the  king- 
dom beyond  sea,  and  for  this  purpose  he  had  a  ship 
lying  ready.  The  Earl  of  Lennox's  letter  came  to 
the  Queen's  hands  on  Michaelmas-day,  and  her  maj- 
esty was  pleased  to  impart  the  same  to  the  lords  of 
her  council ;  and  if  her  majesty  was  surprised  by  this 
advertisement,  these  lords  were  no  less  astonished  to 
understand  that  the  King,  who  may  justly  esteem 
himself  happy,  upon  account  of  the  honor  conferred 
upon  him,  and  whose  chief  aim  should  be  to  render 
himself  grateful  to  her  country,  should  entertain  any 
thoughts  of  departing  after  so  strange  a  manner,  out 
of  her  presence ;  nor  was  it  possible  for  them  to  form 
a  conjecture  from  whence  such  an  imagination  should 
take  its  rise.  Their  lordships,  therefore,  took  a  resolu- 
tion to  talk  with  the  King,  that  they  might  learn  from 
himself  the  occasion  of  this  hasty  deliberation.  The 
same  evening  the  King  came  to  Edinburgh,  but 
made  some  difficulty  to  enter  into  the  palace,  by 
reason  that  three  or  four  lords  *  were  at  that  time 
present  with  the  Queen,  and  peremptorily  insisted 
that  they  might  be  gone  before  he  would  condescend 
to  come  in;  which  deportment  appeared  to  be  abun- 
dantly unreasonable,  since  they  were  three  of  the 
greatest  lords  in  the  kingdom,  and  that  those  kings 
who  by  birth  were  sovereigns  of  the  realm,  have  never 
acted  in  that  manner  towards  the  nobility.  The 
Queen,  however,  received  this  behavior  as  decently 
as  was  possible;  and  condescended  so  far  as  to  meet 
the  King  without  the  palace,  and  so  conducted  him 
into  her  own  apartments;  and  there  he  remained  all

night,  and  then  her  maje-ty  entered  calmly  with  him 
on  the  subject  of  his  'fi«\\\^  abroad,  that  she  might  un- 
derstand from  himself  the  occasion  of  such  a  resolu- 
tion; hut  he  would  by  no  means  give  or  acknowledge 
that  lie  hud  any  occasion  offered  him  of  discontent. 
The  lords  of  council  l»cing  acquainted,  early  next 
morning,  that  the  King  was  going  to  return  to  Stir- 
ling, they  repaired  to  the  Queen's  apartment,  and 
no  other  person  being  present,  except  Monsieur  de 
Croc,  whom  they  prayed  to  assist  with  them,  as  being 
here  on  the  part  of  her  majesty ;  the  occasion  of 
their  being  together  here  was  then,  with  all  humility 
and  reverence  due  to  their  majesties,  proposed:' 
namely,  to  understand  from  the  King,  whether,  ac- 
cording to  advice  imparted  to  the  Queen,  by  the  Earl 
of  Lennox,  he  had  formed  a  resolution  to  depart  by 
sea  out  of  the  realm,  and  upon  what  ground,  and  for 
what  end  ?  That  if  his  resolution  proceeded  from 
discontent,  they  were  earnest  to  know  what  persons 
had  afforded  an  occasion  for  the  same.  That  if  he 
could  complain  of  any  of  the  subjects  of  the  realm,  be 
they  of  what  quality  soever,  the  fault  should  imme- 
diately be  repaired  to  his  satisfaction.  And  now  we 
di«l  remonstrate  with  him,  that  his  own  honor,  and  the 
Queen's  honor,  the  honor  of  us  all,  was  concerned ; 
for  if  without  just  occasion,  he  would  retire  from  the 
palace,  and  abandon  the  society  of  her  to  wbom  he  is 
far  obliged,  that  in  order  to  advance  him,  she 
humbled  herself,  and,  from  being  his  sovereign,  sur- 
rendered herself  to  be  his  wife;  if  he  should  act  in 
this  sort,  the  whole  world  would  blame  him,  as  in- 
grate  and  utterly  unworthy  to  possess  the  place  to 
which  she  had  exalted  him.  On  the  other  hand,  if  any 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  145 

just  occasion  had  been  given  him,  it  behooved  to  be 
very  important,  since  it  inclined  him  to  relinquish  so 
beautiful  a  Queen,  and  noble  realm ;  and  the  same 
must  have  been  afforded  either  by  the  Queen  herself, 
or  us,  her  ministers.  As  for  us,  we  professed  our- 
selves ready  to  do  him  all  the  justice  he  could  demand, 
Then  her  majesty  was  pleased  to  enter  into  the  dis- 
course, and  spoke  affectionately  to  him,  beseeching 
him  that  since  he  would  not  open  his  mind  to  her  in 
private,  according  to  her  most  earnest  request,  he 
would  declare  before  these  lords,  where  she  had  of- 
fended him,  in  anything.  She  likewise  said,  that  she 
had  a  clear  conscience ;  that  in  all  her  life  she  had 
never  done  anything  that  could  prejudice  his  or  her 
honor ;  but,  nevertheless,  as  she  might  have  given  him 
offence  without  design,  she  \vas  willing  £0  make 
amends  as  far  as  he  should  require ;  therefore,  prayed 
him  not  to  dissemble. 

"  But  though  the  Queen  and  all  others,  with  Mon- 
sieur de  Croc,  used  all  the  interest  they  were  able,  he 
would  not  own  that  he  had  intended  any  voyage,  and 
declared  freely,  that  the  Queen  had  given  him  no 
occasion  of  complaint.  Whereupon  he  took  leave  of 
her  majesty,  and  went  his  way,  so  that  we  were  all  of 
opinion  this  was  but  a  false  alarm  the  Earl  of  Len- 
nox was  willing  to  give  her  majesty ;  nevertheless,  by 
a  letter,  which  the  king  has  since  wrote  to  the  Queen 
in  a  sort  of  disguised  style,  it  appears  that  he  still  has 
it  in  his  head  to  leave  the  kingdom ;  and  there  is  an 
advertisement  otherwise,  that  he  is  secretly  proposing 
to  be  gone.

"  'Tis  .true,  that  in  the  letter  he  grounds  a  coin-

plaint  on  two  points;  one  is,  that  her  majesty  trusts 
him  not  with  so  much  authority,  nor  is  at  such  pains 
to  advance  him,  and  make  him  honored,  as  she  first 
&lt;li&lt;I ;  and  the  other  point  is,  that  no  body  attends  him, 
and  that  the  nobility  desert  his  company.  To  these 
the  Queen  has  made  answer,  that  if  the  case  be  so,  he 
ought  to  blame  himself,  and  not  her;  for,  that  in  the 
beginning,  she  had  conferred  so  much  honor  upon 
him,  as  came  afterwards  to  render  herself  uneasy — 
the  credit  and  reputation  wherein  she  had  placed 
him,  having  served  as  a  shadow  to  those  who  have 
most  heinously  offended  her  reputation.  But  not- 
withstanding this,  she  has  continued  to  show  him 
such  respect,  that  although  they  who  did  perpetrate 
the  murder  of  her  faithful  servant,  had  entered  her 
chamber  with  his  knowledge,  having  followed  close, 
and  had  named  him  the  chief  of  their  enterprise;  yet 
would  she  never  accuse,  but  did  always  excuse  him, 
and  was  willing  to  appear  as  though  she  believed  it 
not.  And  then  as  to  his  not  being  attended,  the  fault 
thereof  must  be  charged  upon  himself,  since  she  has 
always  made  an. offer  to  him  of  her  own  servants;  and 
as  for  the  nobility,  they  come  to  court  and  pay  defer- 
ence and  respect,  according  as  they  have  any.  matters 
to  do,  and  as  they  receive  a  kindly  countenance ;  but 
that  he  is  at  no  pains  to  gain  them,  and  make  himself 
Ix-loved,  having  gone  so  far  as  to  prohibit  those  noble- 
men from  entering  his  room,  whom  she  had  first  ap- 
pointed to  be  about  his  person.  If  the  nobility  aban- 
don him,  his  own  deportment  towards  them  is  the 
cause  thereof;  for  if  he  desires  to  be  followed  and  at- 
tended, he  must,  in  the  first  place,  gain  their  love, 
and  for  this  purpose  render  himself  amiable  to  them, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

without  which,  it  would  be  difficult  for  her  majesty 
to  regulate  this  point — especially  to  make  the  nobility 
consent,  that  he  shall  have  the  management  of  affairs 
put  into  his  hands,  because  she  finds  them  utterly 
averse  to  any  such  matter." 

When  Darnley  rose  to  leave  the  council,  he  said  to 
the  Queen,  "  Adieu !  madam.  You  shall  not  see  my 
face  for  a  long  space."  Turning  to  the  lords,  he 
added,  "  Gentlemen,  adieu !  "  At  that  moment  the 
distance  between  him  and  Mary  was  wider,  and  more 
sharply  defined,  than  when  he  reached  Edinburgh. 
He  continued  preparations  for  leaving  the  kingdom, 
but  subsequently  abandoned  them,  to  his  own  and  the 
Queen's  misfortune. 

Instead  of  opposing  any  farther  the  King's  deter- 
mination, Mary  Stuart,  without  inviting  him  to  join 
the  party,  made  a  tour  to  the  south-eastern  frontier, 
to  quell  the  insubordination  of  the  Johnsons,  Arm- 
strongs and  Elliots,  who,  like  mountain-panthers, 
were  fiercely  warring  with  each  other.  October  6th, 
1566,  the  Earl  of  Bothwell,  by  the  Queen's  commis- 
sion, as  lord  lieutenant,  had  repaired  to  the  scene  of 
conflict.  Two  days  after,  the  Queen  reached  Jedburg 
to  hold  her  k&lt;  justice  aire,"  *  or  assizes,  and  sustain 
with  royal  justice  and  presence  the  military  force. 
On  the  day  of  her  arrival,  Bothwell,  in  a  personal 
combat  writh  John  Elliot  of  Park,f  was  dangerously 

*  "  Justice  aires  were  holden  annually  in  the  provinces  for 
the  administration  of  justice.  Many  flagrant  enormities  hav- 
ing been  committed  in  Liddisdale,  it  was  deemed  necessary 
that  the  Queen  should  assist  in  person,  in  the  manner  of  her 
predecessors." 

f  This  John  Elliot,  alias  John  of  Park,  was  a  notorious  out-

wounded,  and  immediately  mn«&gt;vc&lt;l  to  the  f'astle  of 
Hi Tmit;ii:&lt;-,  not  far  from  the  marches,  where  he  en- 
countered tin-  Ixtrderers.  When  Mary  heard  of  the 
Earl's  peril,  &gt;he  "  was  so  highly  grieved  in  heart,  that 
she  took  no  repose  in  body  until  she  saw  him !  " 
With  the  restlessness  of  impatient  l'»ve,  she  remained 
at  Jedburg  officially  until  the  l."&gt;th  of  Oetober,  when 
she  took  a  dashini:  ste&lt; •&lt;!  and  flew  to  the  Hermit 
attended  by  Murray  and  other  nobles.  She  found 
the  favorite  chieftain  pale  and  languishing^  ami 
feared  a  fatal  issue.  Deeply  grieving,  she  yielded  to 
the  urgency  of  affairs,  and  with  marvelous  fleetness 
returned  the  same  day  to  Jedburg;  making  the  whole 
distance  traveled  on  horseback  about  forty  miles. 
But  refusing  rest,  she  employed  the  time  after  reach- 
ing her  apartments,  "  till  the  noon  of  night,"  writing 
to  Bothwell,  whom  she  had  so  recently  left.  The  fol- 
lowing morning  prostrating  disease  crimsoned  her 
cheek,  and  falling  into  a  swoon,  she  lay  at  the  gate 
of  death  for  several  hours.  When  this  insensibility 
passed,  the  fair  sufferer  was  in  the  embrace  of  a  burn- 
ing fever.  Reason  was  dethroned,  and  it  seemed  to 
all  that  life's  golden  bowl  would  soon  be  broken. 
With  returning  consciousness  Marv  thought  also  that 
her  departure  was  near.  Requesting  the  nobles  to 
offer  prayer  in  her  l&gt;ehalf,  she  confided  her  son  to 
Elizabeth,  and  sent  a  messenger  to  apprise  Darnley  of 
her  danger. 

The  tidings  of  Mary's  illness,  spread  over  the 
plains  and  highlands  of  Scotland.  Prominent  mem- 
law.  The  cause  of  the  quarrel  between  the  two  men  ia  not

bers  of  the  nobility  hastened  to  Jedburg.  Meanwhile, 
Bothwell,  convalescent,  with  knightly  ardor  sought 
her  presence.  He  was  member  of  the  privy  council, 
and  would  have  doubtless  been  there,  if  for  no  other 
reason.  But  the  entire  affair,  from  the  combat  with 
the  freebooter,  had  worn  the  romance  of  concealed 
passion. 

Darnley  arrived  the  28th  of  October,  and  finding 
Mary  already  favorably  past  the  crisis  of  her  malady, 
he  tarried  only  a  night,  and  repaired  again  to  Glas- 
gow. A  visit  to  a  wife  and  Queen  on  the  couch  of 
pain,  so  brief  and  coldly  formal,  deepened  the  bitter- 
ness of  her  enmity,  and  stimulated  her  devotion  to 
the  courtly  earl.  The  recovery  to  comparative  health 
was  slow.  November  8th,  she  journeyed  with  care- 
ful conveyance  and  frequent  rest,  to  Kelso,  and 
along  the  coast  to  Craigmillar  Castle,  where  she  took 
apartments  on  the  20th ;  a  distance  of  three  miles 
from  Edinburgh.  Melancholy  and  spectral  from  sor- 
rows and  disease,  she  appeared  yet  on  the  confines  of 
eternity.  De  Croc  wrote  to  the  Archbishop  of  Glas- 
gow :  "  The  Queen  is  not  well.  I  do  believe  the  prin- 
cipal part  of  her  disease  to  consist  of  a  deep  grief  and 
sorrow.  Nor  does  it  seem  possible  to  make  her  for- 
get the  same.  Still  she  repeats  the  words,  '  I  could 
wish  to  be  dead.' '  Said  the  observing  Lethington : 
"  It  is  an  heart-break  for  her  to  think  that  he  should 
be  her  husband,  and  how  to  be  free  of  him  she  sees  no 
outlet."  This  dismal  complaining  awakened  in  the 
minds  of  those  around  her,  various  plans  for  the  re- 
lief of  the  Queen.  Morton,  Ruthven  and  Lindsay, 
who  were  connected  with  her  counselors,  by  ties  of  re- 
lationship or  friendship,  having  shed  the  blood  of 


150  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

Rizzio,  were  ready  for  further  dark  conspiracies. 
Lethington  arranged  a  plan  with  shrewd  calculation, 
and  daring  disregard  of  tragical  results.  lie  pro- 
posed the  return  of  the  exiled  murderers,  on  condi- 
tions of  a  divorce  from  Darnley,  and  if  necessary,  his 
assassination.  Both  well  s&lt;-i/c&lt;l  the  suggestion  enthu- 
siastically, and  Argyll-  ami  Huntley  assented.  Mur- 
ray was  anxious  to  have  his  sister  secure  a  divorce,  as 
the  only  deliverance  from  greater  evils.  When  the 
scheme  was  broached  to  Mary  Stuart,  she  answered, 
"  That  on  two  conditions  she  niipht  agree  to  the  pro- 
posal :  The  first,  that  the  divorce  should  be  made  law- 
fully, and  that  it  should  not  prejudice  her  son;  other- 
wise, she  would  rather  endure  all  torments,  and  abide 
the  perils  that  might  ensue." 

The  Earl  of  Bothwcll  answered,  "  The  divorce 
might  be  made  without  prejudice  to  the  prince,  since 
he  himself  had  succeeded  to  his  father's  title  and 
estate;  although  he  had  been  divorced  from  his 
mother." 

It  was  also  suggested  that  after  the  divorce,  the 
King  should  remain  in  one  part  of  the  country,  the 
Queen  in  another,  or  that  he  should  withdraw  to  a 
foreign  land. 

The  Queen  here  said,  "  That  perhaps  he  would 
change  his  opinion,  and  that  it  was  better  that  she 
herself  for  a  time  passed  into  France." 

Then  Lethington  rejoined,  '•  Think  ye  not  that  we, 
who  are  of  the  chief  of  your  nobility  and  council, 
shall  find  means  that  you  be  quit  of  him  without 
prejudice  to  your  son  ?  and  although  my  Lord  of  Mur- 
ray be  no  less  scrupulous  for  a  Protestant  than  your 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

grace  for  a  Papist,  I  am  sure  lie  will  look  through  his 
fingers  thereto,  and  will  behold  otir  doings." 

The  Queen  here  answered  decidedly,  "  I  will  that 
ye  do  nothing  to  spot  my  honor  or  conscience;  and 
therefore  I  pray  you  let  the  matter  rest,  till  God  of 
his  goodness  find  the  remedy."  * 

Lethington  closes  the  conference  by  remarking, 
"  Madam,  let  us  guide  the  business  among  us,  and 
your  grace  shall  see  nothing  but  good,  and  approved 
by  Parliament."  This  interview  was  immediately 
followed  by  an  act  which  was  the  shadow  of  fearful 
events.  The  lords  entered  into  a  bond  and  solemn 
oath,  "  to  cut  off  the  King  as  a  young  fool  and  tyrant, 
who  was  an  enemy  to  the  nobility,  and  had  conducted 
himself  in  an  intolerable  manner  to  the  Queen." 
Pledging  to  each  other  fidelity  unto  death,  in  this  de- 
fence of  the  state,  the  covenant  was  signed  by  Sir 
James  Balfour,  the  writer,  and  a  partizan  of  Both- 
well,  Huntley,  Lethington  and  Argyle,  and  committed 
to  the  care  of  Bothwell.  A  few  weeks  later,  the  royal 
christening  occurred  at  Stirling  Castle.  Mary  was 
educated  amid  pomp,  of  which  she  was  fond,  and 
preparations  for  the  festival  had  been  made  on  a 
magnificent  scale. 

The  Pope's  nuncio  was  invited  to  attend,  but  upon 
more  prudent  advice,  Mary  prevented  his  appearance 
on  dangerous  ground.  Elizabeth  appointed  the  Coun- 
tess of  Argyle  to  represent  her  as  godmother,  and 
dispatched  Bedford  with  a  font  of  gold,  valued  at  five 
thousand  dollars,  to  be  used  at  the  ceremony.  Darn- 
ley  was  not  present,  though  in  the  Castle.  In  the

consciousness  of  his  degradation,  and  in  anger,  he 
shut  himself  in  his  room  till  the  imposing  service  was 
concluded.  Bothwell  was  master  of  ceremonies, 
though  a  Protestant;  and  but  two  of  the  nobles  had 
been  adherents  of  Rome.  Mary  shone  in  jewels,  il- 
lustrating what  is  oftener  tme  than  known,  that  be- 
neath a  golden  vestment  and  robe  may  beat  an  anx- 
ious heart,  and  under  a  crown,  throb  a  troubled  brain. 
Such  is  God's  eternal  law  of  correspondence  between 
a  man's  real  condition  and  his  character.  The  French 
ambassador,  De  Croc,  wrote  a  letter  descriptive  of 
the  baptismal  scene,  and  the  incidents  which  oc- 
curred: 

"  DECEMBER  23d. 

"  The  christening  of  the  prince  was  solemnized  on 
Tuesday  last,  when  he  received  the  name  of  Charles 
James;  it  was  the  Queen's  pleasure  that  he  should 
bear  the  name  of  James,  together  with  Charles,  after 
the  King  of  France,  because,  said  she,  all  the  good 
Kings  of  Scotland,  his  predecessors,  who  have  been 
most  devoted  to  the  crown  of  France,  were  called  by 
the  name  of  James.  Everything  was  performed  ac- 
cording to  the  holy  Catholic  church.  The  King, 
Lord  Darnley,  had  still  given  out  that  he  should  de- 
part two  days  before  the  christening:  but  when  the 
time  approached,  he  gave  no  sign  of  removal;  only, 
he  still  kept  close  within  his  own  apartment.  The 
very  day  of  the  ceremony,  he  sent  three  times,  desir- 
ing me  either  to  come  and  see  him,  or  to  appoint  the 
hour  when  he  might  come  to  my  lodgings;  so  that  I 
found  myself  obliged  to  signify  to  him,  that  since  he 
was  on  no  good  terms  with  the  Queen,  I  had  been 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  153 

charged  by  the  most  Christian  king,  to  have  no  com- 
munication with  him.  And  I  caused  him  also  to  be 
told,  that  as  it  would  not  be  proper  for  him  to  come 
to  my  lodgings,  where  there  was  a  crowd  of  company ; 
as  he  might  understand  that  there  were  two  passages 
in  it,  and  that  if  he  entered  by  one  door,  I  should  be 
constrained  to  go  out  by  the  other ;  nor  can  any  good 
be  expected  from  him.  I  cannot  pretend  to  foretell 
how  all  may  terminate,  but  this  I  will  say,  that  mat- 
ters cannot  long  remain  as  they  are,  without  produc- 
ing bad  consequences." 

Mary,  upon  the  renewed  entreaty  of  Lethington 
and  Bothwell,  restored  Morton,  Ruthven,  Lindsay, 
and  seventy-six  more  of  the  refugees.  Elizabeth,  in 
private  correspondence,  had  advised  the  Queen  to  do 
so,  and  also  to  treat  Darnley  with  kindness.  But  the 
King,  alarmed  at  the  return  of  his  own  instruments 
of  vengeance,  hastily  abandoned  the  court,  and  took 
up  his  residence  in  Glasgow,  at  his  father's  house. 
The  small-pox  was  prevailing,  and  he  became  its  vic- 
tim. 

Notwithstanding,  the  plot  against  his  life  went 
steadily  forward.  Bothwell,  who  was  the  soul  of  the 
conspiracy,  continued  to  gain  confederates.  Morton 
returned  to  Scotland  the  fore  part  of  January,  1567. 
The  earl  made  an  unwearied  effort  to  enlist  his  power- 
ful co-operation,  but  he  refused,  though  assured  that 
the  Queen  approved  the  measure,  unless  he  could  see 
her  signature  of  sanction.  This  he  attempted  to  ob- 
tain, and  failed.  Whether  Mary  had  withheld  all 
connivance  from  her  admirer,  or  was  governed  by 
prudence  only,  cannot  be  certainly  known.  It  was 
rumored  at  this  time,  that  the  King  had  determined 


154  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

to  seize  tbe  person  of  his  son  James,  have  him 
crowned,  and  hold  in  the  name  of  the  prince  the 
sceptre  of  the  realm.  Mary  was  sufficiently  disturbed 
to  remove  James  to  Edinburgh,  that  no  surprise 
might  give  reality  to  her  fears.  Darnley  was  recover- 
ing from  sickness,  but  powerless  as  infancy. 

The  Queen  accused  him  of  the  absurd  design,  and 
expressed  her  feelings  in  a  communication  to  the 
Archbishop  of  Glasgow : 

"  For  the  King,  our  husband,  God  knows  always 
our  part  towards  him,  and  his  behavior  and  thankful- 
ness to  us  in  semblament  well  known  to  God  and  the 
world — especially  our  own  subjects  see  it — and  in 
their  hearts,  we  doubt  not,  condemn  the  same, — al- 
ways we  perceive  him  occupied,  busily  enough,  to 
have  inquisition  of  our  doings,  which,  God  willing, 
shall  always  be  such  as  none  shall  have  occasion  to 
be  offended  with,  or  to  report  of  us  any  ways  but  hon- 
orably. Howsoever  he,  his  father,  and  their  follow- 
ers speak,  who  we  know  want  no  good  will  to  make 
us  ado,  if  their  power  were  equivalent  to  their  mind; 
but  God  moderates  their  forces  well  enough,  and  takes 
iiH-jiMH  of  the  execution  of  their  pretences  from  them, 
for  as  we  believe  they  shall  find  none  or  very  few  ap- 
provers of  thoir  councils  and  devices,  imagined  to  our 
displeasure  or  disliking;  and  thus  commit  you  to  the 
l&gt;r«&gt;trction  of  God. 

"  Your  right  good  mistress, 
"At  Edinburgh,  the  20th  Jan.  1560." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  155 

Soon  after  this  letter  was  written,  Mary  left  the 
capital  for  Glasgow.  She  found  Darnley  still  an  in- 
valid, and  greatly  amazed  at  her  visit,  because  he 
had  heard  of  her  suspicions,  and  caught  faint  tokens 
of  an  impending  bolt.  He  told  her  all,  expressing 
his  sad  apprehensions,  although  he  knew  she  had  re- 
fused to  sign  a  paper  authorizing  his  seizure,  and  if 
he  resisted,  his  murder. 

"  He  added  that  he  would  never  think  that  she, 
who  was  his  own  proper  flesh,  would  do  him  any  • 
hurt:  and  then,  with  more  vanity  than  confidence, 
he  declared  that  if  any  others  should  intend  to  injure 
him,  he  would  sell  his  life  dear,  unless  they  took  him 
sleeping.  Mary  in  her  turn  reminded  him  of  his  in- 
tention to  retire  to  the  Continent,  and  of  the  project 
attributed  to  him  by  Hiegate  and  Walcar.*  He  af- 
firmed that  he  had  never  been  serious  in  his  threats 
of  departure,  and  denied  the  second  charge  with  ve- 
hemence." Mary,  at  length,  with  her  gentle  persua- 
sion, tearful  and  lustrous  blue  eyes,  subduing  re- 
proaches, and  expressions  of  affection,  won  the  confi- 
dence of  the  vacillating,  miserable  phantom  of  roy- 
alty. He  had  always  loved  her,  and  his  alienation 
was  that  of  wounded  pride,  and  undisguised  contempt 
from  the  object  of  love  and  ambition.  His  confes- 
sions were  full,  and  promises  for  the  future  satisfac- 
tory. 

He  begged  her  to  leave  him  no  more.  Mary  then 
wished  him  to  go  to  Craigmillar  soon  as  able  to  travel 
on  a  litter;  he  consented,  if  she  would  receive  him 
cordially  to  her  heart,  as  her  true  husband.  To  this

156  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

she  assented,  and  gave  him  her  hand,  suggesting  a 
delay  till  cured  of  his  sickness,  and  desired  him  to 
keep  the  reconciliation  a  secret,  to  avoid  giving  of- 
fence to  the  nobles.  The  mind  pauses  over  this  scene, 
bewildered  and  sad.  To  believe  Mary  entirely  sin- 
cere in  so  great  and  sudden  a  transition  of  manner,  is 
an  amplitude  of  charitable  credulity  it  would  be 
pleasant  to  award.  To  doubt  her  truthfulness,  is  to 
people  the  obscurity  of  a  woman's  heart  with  more 
demoniac  inmates,  than  the  deepest  depravity  in  time 
would  seem  to  warrant.  By  whatever  reasons,  en- 
forced by  a  false  training,  she  hushed  the  upbraidings 
of  conscience,  the  conclusion  of  perfidy  is  inevitable. 
She  was  impetuous  in  feeling,  and  gave  herself  to  a 
favorite  object  with  almost  insane  ardor.  Bothwell 
manifestly  ruled  the  Queen,  and  she  stooped  to  his 
lawless  designs.  He  had  transferred  Nicholas  Hu- 
bert, his  servant,  more  familiarly  called  Paris,  from 
the  city  of  his  nativity,  to  her  service.  He  was  in 
the  conspiracy  of  his  former  master,  and  was  with  the 
Queen  during  her  visit  to  Glasgow.  Paris,  only  two 
days  after  Mary's  arrival,  was  the  bearer  of  a  letter 
to  Bothwell,  containing  evidences  of  attachment  to 
the  earl,  and  comments  on  the  interview  with  Darn- 
Icy,  in  these  remarkable  words: 

"  I  have  never  seen  him  better,  or  speak  so  humbly, 
and  if  I  had  not  known  from  experience  that  his 
heart  is  as  soft  as  wax,  and  mine  as  hard  as  diamond, 
I  should  almost  have  taken  pity  on  him.  However, 
fear  nothing.  You  constrain  me  so  to  dissimulate, 
that  I  am  horrified,  seeing  that  you  do  not  merely 
foree  nir  t&lt;&gt;  piny  the  part  of  a  traitress;  I  pray  you 
rememlKT  that,  if  desire  to  please  you  did  not  force 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  157 

me,  I  would  rather  die  than  commit  these  things ;  for 
my  heart  bleeds  to  do  them.  In  brief,  he  will  not 
come  with  me,  unless  upon  this  condition,  that  I  shall 
promise  to  use  in  common  with  him  a  single  table, 
and  the  same  bed  as  before,  and  that  I  shall  not  leave 
him  so  often,  and  that  if  I  will  do  this,  he  will  do  all 
I  wish,  and  will  follow  me."  Carried  away  by  the 
violence  of  her  love,  she  told  Both  well  that  she  would 
obey  him  in  all  things;  and  begged  him  not  to  con- 
ceive a  bad  opinion  of  her ;  "  because,"  she  continued, 
"  you  yourself  are  the  occasion  of  it ;  I  would  never 
act  against  him,  to  gratify  my  own  private  revenge." 

In  her  wild  impulses,  she  laid  on  the  altar  of  sacri- 
fice to  BothwelFs  ambition,  her  honor,  principle,  and 
conscience — a  mournful  example  of  frailty  and  guilt, 
upon  the  summit  of  human  greatness.  Paris  con- 
veyed the  message,  with  a  purse  of  gold,  and  bracelets 
which  Mary  had  made  for  Bothwell.  The  faithful 
servant  was  directed  to  inquire  where  Darnley  should 
be  lodged,  in  the  Kirk  of  Field  or  at  Craigmillar. 
It  was  deemed  improper  to  take  the  King  to  the  pal- 
ace, on  account  of  his  malady.  It  was  decided  by 
Bothwell  and  Lethington  to  give  the  invalid  apart- 
ments in  the  Kirk  of  Field,  which  was  "  a  large,  open 
space  near  an  old  Dominican  convent  of  Blackfriars." 

In  the  pleasant  area  were  gardens  and  houses,  the 
residences  of  the  Duke  of  Chatellerault,  Robert  Bal- 
four,  a  relative  of  Sir  James,  who  drew  the  murder- 
ous bond,  and  others.  The  house  of  Balfour  was  se- 
lected, because,  though  less  spacious,  it  was  more  se- 
cluded than  any  other  dwelling.  Paris  saw  Bothwell 
and  James  Balfour  in  consultation,  who  gave  to  the 
servant  this  brief  and  significant  direction :  u  He- 


158  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

turn  to  the  Queen,  and  recommend  me  very  humbly 
to  her  grace,  and  tell  her  all  will  go  well,  for  Mr. 
James  Balfour  and  I  have  not  slept  the  whole  night, 
so  we  have  set  all  tilings  in  order,  and  have  got  ready 
the  house.  And  tell  the  Queen  that  I  send  to  her  this 
diamond  by  your  hands,  and  that  if  I  had  my  heart, 
I  would  send  it  to  her  very  willingly."  It  was  not 
long  before  poor  Darnley  was  moving  slowly  towards 
the  place  of  doom,  and  lavishing  caresses  on  the 
Queen,  who  wrote  to  Both  well,  "  according  to  the 
commission  which  I  have  received,  I  shall  bring  the 
man  with  me  Monday." 

1  )arnley  consented  to  the  arrangement  for  the  Kirk 
of  Field.  But  his  mind  was  •  !!&gt;•  tressed  with  the  ap- 
prehension of  treachery.  He  said  to  Crawford,  "I 
have  fears  enough,  but  may  God  judge  between  us. 
I  have  her  promise  only  to  trust  to,  but  I  have  put 
myself  in  her  hands,  and  shall  go  with  her,  though 
sho  should  murder  me."  Bothwell  met  Mary  and  the 
King  just  before  they  reached  Edinburgh  ;  and  on  the 
;llst  of  January,  the  invalid,  trembling  with  dread 
presentiments,  entered  the  apartment  from  which 
lie  would  not  depart  alive.  The  house  was  small  and 
poorly  furnished.  It  was  of  two  stories,  the  lower 
containing  a  cellar,  and  a  single  room  besides;  the 
upper  story  was  divided  into  a  gallery  over  the  cellar, 
and  a  hed-chamher  corresponding  to  the  room  beneath. 
"  Nelson,  Darnley 's  servant,  when  he  arrived  at  Kirk 
of  Field,  was  about  to  prepare  the  Duke  of  Chatel- 
lerault's  house  for  the  reception  of  his  master.  But 
the  Queen  prevented  him,  and  directed  him  to  Bal- 
four's  house,  whither  the  necessary  furniture  was 
conveyed,  and  which  Bothwell  had  evidently  chosen, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  159 

that  lie  might  carry  out  his  murderous  intentions  with 
greater  facility.  Darnley  was  established  on  the  first 
floor,  where  his  three  servants,  Taylor,  Nelson,  and 
Edward  Simons,  occupied  the  gallery,  which  served 
at  once  as  a  wardrobe  and  cabinet.  The  cellar  on  the 
ground  floor  was  transformed  into  a  kitchen,  and  the 
Queen  had  a  bed  prepared  for  herself  in  the  room 
immediately  below  that  in  which  the  King  slept.  She 
also  directed  that  the  door  at  the  foot  of  the  staircase, 
which  communicated  between  the  ground-floor  and 
the  upper  rooms,  should  be  removed.  Thus  installed, 
though  very  uncomfortably,  by  Darnley's  side,  she 
passed  several  nights  under  the  same  roof  with  him. 
Her  assiduity,  her  attention,  and  the  manifold  proofs 
which  she  gave  him  of  her  affection,  were  all  well  cal- 
culated to  dispel  his  fears." 

Meanwhile,  the  Earl  of  Bothwell  was  busy  with 
his  remorseless  imaginings,  whose  unfinished  plan 
was  the  murder  of  the  object  between  him  and  a 
throne.  He  had  enlisted,  to  act  subordinate  parts,  his 
chamberlain,  tailor,  porter,  and  others,  whose  metle 
he  had  tested  in  frontier  conflicts.  Ealse  keys  were 
prepared,  and  a  barrel  of  gunpowder  procured  by 
Bothwell.  Paris  tried  the  keys,  to  be  sure  of  their 
similarity,  but  when  his  old  master  unfolded  the 
whole  plan  of  assassination,  he  hesitated,  fearing  his 
own  destruction  might  be  the  result.  And  according 
to  subsequent  confession  of  the  Frenchman,  the  fol- 
lowing conversation  occurred : 

"  On  hearing  him  my  heart  grew  faint ;  I  did  not 
say  a  word,  but  cast  down  my  eyes."  Bothwell,  who 
was  not  pleased  at  his  silence  and  consternation, 
looked  at  him  with  impatience,  and  asked  him  what 


l,;o  M  \UY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

he  thought  of  tlu1  plan.  "'  Sir,  I  think  that  what  yon 
tell  me  is  a  great  thing."  "  What  is  your  opinion  of 
it? "  reiterated  IJothwoll.  "  Pardon  me,  sir,  if  I  tell 
you  my  opinion  according  to  my  poor  mind." 
"  What !  are  you  going  to  preach  to  me  ? "  u  No,  sir, 
you  shall  hear  presently."  "  Well !  say  on."  Paris 
then  reminded  him  of  the  trouble  and  misfortunes  of 
his  past  life,  and  sought  to  dissuade  him  from  this 
murder,  which  would  destroy  his  present  tranquillity, 
and  endanger  the  extraordinary  favor  which  he  had 
attained.  He  concluded  by  telling  him :  "  Now,  sir, 
if  you  undertake  this  thing,  it  will  be  the  greatest 
trouble  you  ever  had,  above  all  others  you  have  en- 
dured, for  every  one  will  cry  out  upon  you,  and  you 
will  be  destroyed."  "  Well,"  said  Botiiwell,  ''  have 
you  done  ? "  "  You  will  pardon  me,  sir,  if  you 
please,  if  I  have  spoken  to  you  according  to  my  poor 
mind."  "  Fool  that  you  are !  "  said  Bothwell,  "  do 
you  think  that  I  am  doing  this  all  alone  by  myself  '.  " 
*'*  Sir,  I  do  not  know  how  you  are  going  to  do  it,  but 
I  know  well  that  it  will  be  the  greatest  trouble  you 
ever  had."  "  And  how  so  ?  "  said  Bothwell ;  "  I  have 
already  with  me  Lethington,  who  is  esteemed  one  of 
the  most  prudent  men  in  this  country,  and  who  is  the 
undertaker  of  all  this;  and  I  have  also  the  Earl  of 
Aiiryle,  my  brother  Huntley,  Morton,  Ruthven,  and 
Lindsay.  These  three  last  will  never  fail  me,  for  I 
have  bogged  for  their  pardon,  and  I  have  the  signa- 
tures of  all  those  I  have  mentioned  to  you.  We  were 
desirous  to  do  it  the  last  time  we  were  at  Craigmillar ; 
but  you  are  a  fool  and  poor  of  mind,  unworthy  to 
hear  anything  of  consequence." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  161 

Paris  finally  consented  to  Bothwell's  satanic  propo- 
sals, it  may  be  with  less  pause  than  he  affirms.  He 
promised  to  introduce  Hay  of  Tallo,  Hepburn,  and 
Ormiston,  into  Mary's  chamber,  on  the  evening  ap- 
pointed for  the  deed,  while  she  was  with  Darnley, 
that  they  might  deposit  the  powder  there.  Paris  was 
ordered  not  to  place  the  Queen's  bed  under  the  King, 
because  the  explosion  must  be  where  it  stood.  This 
was  neglected,  and  he  affirms  that  Mary,  coming  in, 
directed  the  change  to  be  made.  The  night  of  Sun- 
day, February  9th,  was  the  time  designated  for  the 
terrible  experiment.  Paris  says,  the  Queen  then  sub- 
stituted worn  drapery  for  the  new  velvet  in  Darnley's 
chamber;  and  Nelson,  Bothwell's  servant,  testified, 
that  she  removed  a  rich  coverlet  of  fur  from  her  own 
apartment. 

Sabbath  evening  she  was  with  Darnley,  conversing 
familiarly,  while  the  enginery  of  death  was  in  prep- 
aration below.  Toward  sunset  of  the  holy  day,  Both- 
well  had  assembled  his  accomplices,  and  assigned  to 
each  his  part  in  the  midnight  close  of  a  slow  and 
cruel  conspiracy.  At  ten  o'clock  the  sacks  of  powder 
were  carried  from  a  secluded  hall,  in  Holyrood  Ab- 
bey, near  Bothwell's  lodgings,  across  the  gardens  by 
Wilson,  Powrie,  and  Dalgleish,  to  Blackf riars  Wynd ; 
when  Hay  of  Tallo,  Hepburn,  and  Ormiston,  re- 
ceiving them,  deposited  the  treasure  of  ruin,  with  the 
aid  of  Paris,  in  the  Queen's  chamber.  When  all  was 
ready  for  the  match,  Paris  went  to  the  King's  room, 
and  the  Queen,  recollecting  her  promise  to  be  present 
that  night  at  a  masquerade  in  the  palace,  in  honor  of 
the  marriage  of  her  servant  Bastian,  kissed  the  fever- 
ish lips  of  Darnley,  and  taking  a  tender  adieu,  has-

trued  with  her  suite,  including  BothwcJl.  by  the  lii:ht 
of  torches,  to  the  festival.  The  Kini:  watched  her 
receding  form  with  melancholy  sighs;  and  as  silence 
settled  ominously  around  him,  Nelson,  standing  in 
the  deserted  hall,  heard  him  repeat  the  55th  Psalm. 
By  a  singular  coincidence,  it  was  in  the  English  even- 
ing service  of  that  day.  There  was  something  start- 
ling and  prophetic  in  these  verses,  which  fell  tremu- 
lously on  the  "  electric  air :  " 

•  •  My  heart  is  disquieted  within  me,  and  the  fear  of  death 
is  fallen  upon  me. 

••  Tearfulness  and  trembling  are  come  upon  me,  and  an 
horrible  dread  hath  overwhelmed  me. 

"  And  I  said,  O  that  1  had  wings  like  a  dove,  for  then  would 
1  flee  away,  and  be  at  rest. 

"  It  is  not  an  open  enemy  that  hath  done  me  this  dishonor, 
for  then  I  could  have  borne  it. 

•  •  Neither  was  it  mine  adversary  that  did  magnify  himself 
against  me,  for  then  peradventure  I  would  have  hid  myself 
from  him. 

••  But  it  was  even  thou,  my  companion,  my  guide,  and  my 
own  familiar  friend." 

After  the  excitement  of  awakened  fear  had  sub- 
sided, the  desolate  invalid  fell  asleep,  with  Taylor, 
his  young  page,  lying  near  him.  Bothwell  about  mid- 
night left  the  dance,  and  rejoined  his  associates. 
Doffing  his  elegant  costume  of  black  velvet  and  satin, 
for  common  apparel,  he  took  Dalgleish,  Paris,  Wilson 
and  Powrie,  and  descended  cautiously  into  the 
Queen's  garden,  directing  his  steps  toward  the  south- 
ern gate.  The  appearance  of  men  along  that  unfre- 
quented path,  in  the  darkness  of  night,  surprised  the 
sentinels  on  guard,  and  the  quick  challenge  was 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  163 

given :  "  Who  goes  there  ?  "  "  Friends !  "  answered 
Powrie.  "  Whose  friends  ?  "  demanded  the  guards : 
"  Friends  of  Lord  Bothwell !  "  was  the  reply.  Pass- 
ing on,  the  conspirators  found  the  Xether-bowgate, 
by  which  they  intended  to  leave  the  city,  shut.  Wil- 
son calling  to  Galloway,  the  gate-keeper,  awoke  him, 
and  desired  him  to  "  open  the  port  to  friends  of  Lord 
Bothwell !  "  Galloway  inquired  what  they  were  doing 
out  of  their  beds  at  that  hour  of  night.  Without  an- 
swering, they  went  on,  and  called  for  Ormiston,  who 
had  assisted  in  getting  the  powder.  But  upon  re- 
flection, apprehending  personal  danger,  he  had  re- 
tired to  bed,  and  refused  to  regard  the  summons  of 
Bothwell.  At  Blackfriars  Wynd,  the  earl,  leaving 
his  comrades,  proceeded  alone  to  Kirk  of  Field,  to 
meet  Hepburn,  and  Hay  of  Tallo,  in  Balfour's  gar- 
den. These  two  faithful  instruments  of  Bothwell  just 
then  entered,  by  the  false  keys,  into  Darnley's  apart- 
ment. The  noise  startled  the  unquiet  sleeper,  and  he 
sprang  from  his  bed  to  escape.  The  messengers  of 
death  seized  him,  and  in  a  moment  he  was  gasping 
for  life  in  their  grasp.  Having  strangled  the  page  in 
the  same  manner,  the  bodies  were  removed  to  an  or- 
chard not  far  distant.  Hepburn  then  lighted  the 
match,  which  ran  to  the  gunpowder  below,  and  with 
Bothwell,  and  Hay  of  Tallo,  retired  to  see  the  explo- 
sion. 

There  those  daring  conspirators  stood  in  the  still- 
ness of  deepest  night,  the  King's  dying  cries  yet  in 
their  ears,  for  a  quarter  of  an  hour,  when,  with  a  ter- 
rific shock  and  noise,  the  house  flew  in  fragments, 
leaving  the  body  of  Darnley  unscathed  and  unbruised 
by  the  scattered  wreck. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

The  bandits  then  went  with  speed  to  Edinburgh, 
Both  well,  failing  on  account  of  the  arm  maimed  in 
tight,  to  climb  as  he  expected  over  a  broken  rampart, 
was  obliged  again  to  awaken  Galloway,  ami  cuter  by 
Nether-bow  gate.  Upon  approaching  the  palace,  the 
sentinels  challenged  the  murderers,  but  |&gt;eriuitted 
them  to  pass.  Both  well  went  hurriedly  to  his  cham- 
ber, drank  wine  to  calm  his  agitation,  and  sought 
pose.  His  heart  was  still  beating  tumultuously,  when 
Hacket,  a  servant,  knocked  abruptly  at  the  door.  It 
was  opened,  and  he  entered,  the  very  ghost  of  terror. 
Bothwell,  with  great  self-command,  inquired  what 
was  the  matter.  Hacket  answered :  '*  The  King's 
house  is  blown  up,  and  I  trow  the  King  is  slain." 
Bothwell  started  with  apparent  amazement,  and 
si  muted,  "Treason ! "  Dressing  himself,  he  was  joined 
by  Huntley,  and  they  went  to  inform  the  Queen.  The 
bold  assassin  then  repaired  with  a  band  of  soldiers  to 
the  place  of  his  successful  villainy.  At  daybreak, 
multitudes,  called  together  by  the  explosion,  and  the 
tidings  which  followed  swiftly,  gathered  around  the 
demolished  dwelling,  and  the  ghastly  forms  of  the 
King  and  his  unoffending  servant.  Bothwell  dis- 
jK'rsed  the  wondering  ami  indignant  throng,  and  for- 
bidding any  examination  of  the  bodies,  ordered  them 
taken  to  an  adjacent  house.  The  quick  eye  of  the 
many  observers,  however,  had  noticed  the  absence  of 
mutilation,  and  that  not  so  much  "  as  the  smell  of  fire 
was  on  the  garments  "  of  the  dead.  Darnley  was 
buried  privately  in  the  chapel  of  Holyrood.  And 
now  followed  the  fierce  commotion  in  the  world  of 
thought.  The  moral  atmosphere  was  surcharged  with 
the  elements  of  retribution,  to  fall  erelong  some- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  165 

where;  and  millions  of  minds  at  home  and  abroad 
•were  feeling  for  the  fearful  secret  of  guilt.  It  is 
impossible  to  escape  the  conviction  that  Mary  was  the 
responsible  motive  of  Bothwell's  ambition,  as  Darn- 
ley  was  the  helpless  sacrifice.  She  transmitted  with- 
out delay  a  communication  to  the  Archbishop  of 
Glasgow,  which  certainly  is  marked  with  extraordi- 
nary coolness  of  narration : 

"EDINBURGH,  Feb.  10,  1567. 

"  Most  Reverend  Father  in  God,  and  trusted  Coun- 
sellor, we  greet  you  well : 

u  We  have  received  this  morning  your  letters  of 
27th  January,  by  your  servant,  Robert  Drury,  con- 
taining in  one  part  sic  advertisement  as  we  find  by 
effect  over  true,  albeit  the  success  has  not  altogether 
been  sic  as  the  authors  of  that  mischievous  fact  had 
preconceived  and  put  it  in  execution ;  and  if  God  in 
his  mercy  had  not  preserved  us,  as  we  trust,  to  the 
end  that  we  may  take  a  rigorous  vengeance  of  that 
mischievous  deed,  which,  ere  it  shall  remain  unpun- 
ished, we  had  rather  lose  life  and  all.  The  matter  is 
so  horrible  and  strange,  as  we  believe  the  like  was 
never  heard  of  in  any  country. 

"  This  night  past,  being  the  9th  of  February,  a  lit- 
tle after  two  hours  after  midnight,  the  house  wherein 
the  King  was  lodged  was,  in  one  instant,  blown  into 
the  air,  he  lying  asleep  in  his  bed,  with  sic  a  vehe- 
mency  that  of  the  whole  lodging,  walls  and  other, 
there  is  nothing  remaining;  na,  not  a  stone  above  an- 
other, but  all  either  carried  far  away,  or  dang  in  dross 
to  the  very  ground  stone.  It  must  be  done  by  the 
force  of  gunpowder,  and  appears  to  have  been  a  mine. 


166  M.Mcv  «.&gt;i-i:i-:x  OF  SCOTS. 

By  whom  it  has  been  &lt;l«m«-.  or  in  what  manner,  ap- 
pears not  yet. 

"  We  doubt  not,  but  according  to  the  diligence  our 
council  has  begun  already  to  use,  the  certainty  of  all 
shall  be  ttsit  shortly,  and  the  same  being  discovered, 
which  we  wot  God  will  not  suffer  to  lie  hid,  we  hope 
to  punish  the  same  with  sic  rigor  as  shall  serve  for 
example  of  this  cruelty  to  all  ages  to  come.  Always 
whoever  has  taken  this  wicked  enterprise  in  hand,  we 
assure  ourselves  it  was  dressit  as  well  for  ourself  as 
for  the  King,  (for  we  lay  for  the  most  part  of  all  last 
week  in  that  same  lodging,  and  was  there  accom- 
panied with  the  most  part  of  the  lords  that  were  in 
this  town,)  and  that  same  night  at  midnight,  and  of 
very  chance  tarried  not  all  night  there  by  reason  of 
some  masks  at  the  abbey  (Holyrood)  :  But  we  believe 
it  was  not  chance  but  God,  that  put  in  our  head. 

"  We  dispatched  this  bearer  upon  the  sudden ; 
therefore  write  to  you  the  more  shortly.  The  rest  of 
the  letter  we  shall  answer  at  more  leisure,  within  four 
or  five  days,  by  your  own  servant.  And  so  for  the 
present  we  commit  you  to  Almighty  God." 

Mary  appeared  crushed  with  sorrow,  but  it  took  the 
form  of  silent  dejection.  She  displayed  none  of  the 
laudable  energy  with  which  she  hunted  out  the  slay- 
ers of  Rizzio.  Returning  to  her  chamber,  she  would 
see  none  but  Bothwell.  There  is  also  the  testimony 
recorded  by  Laing,  given  in  subsequent  trials  before 
the  judges,  and  upon  the  scaffold,  by  the  menials  in 
this  murderous  work.  From  the  reconciliation  with 
Darnley  at  Glasgow,  there  is  a  train  of  circumstantial 
evidence  of  Mary's  complicity,  more  conclusive  than 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  167 

that  which  has  consigned  many  a  criminal  to  the  ex- 
ecutioner's axe.  This  conviction  of  her  guilt  at  the 
tribunal  of  unbiased  judgment,  however  reluctantly 
allowed,  is  only  a  single  item  of  proof,  darkening  the 
historic  annals  of  a  fallen  race,  that  intellect,  beauty, 
and  pride  of  place  are  no  security  against  the  insid- 
ious and  destructive  power  of  unsubdued  selfishness, 
taking  the  descending  channel  of  wild  and  stormy 
passion.  Nothing  but  Christian  humility  and  trust 
in  an  infinite  Guide  can  save,  amid  strong  tempta- 
tions, immortality  in  a  hovel  or  on  a  throne,  from 
the  strand  of  moral  ruin. 


CHAPTER  V. 

MABY,  immediately  after  the  horrors  of  the  King's 
assassination,  wrote  the  letter  above  quoted  to  Arch- 
bishop of  Glasgow.  It  was  left  to  her  privy  council, 
most  of  whom  were  actors  in  the  regicide,  and  whose 
guiding  genius  was  the  remorseless  Lethington,  to  in- 
form the  French  court  of  what  had  occurred.  After 
making  a  favorable  impression  on  Catherine  De  Med- 
ici and  her  nobility,  February  12th,  she  issued  a  proc- 
lamation, offering  a  reward  of  two  thousand  pounds  to 
any  one  who  would  disclose  the  murderers  of  her  hus- 
band, or  give  information  which  would  lead  to  their 
detection.  This  was  the  signal  for  a  public  expres- 
sion of  popular  feeling. 

The  convictions  of  hitherto  silent  observers  of  pass- 
ing events,  came  to  the  surface  with  fearful  distinct- 
ness and  rapidity,  as  if  past  atonement  were  made  for 
the  painful  and  brief  delay.  The  night  after  the 
royal  proclamation,  a  paper  was  fastened  on  the  door 
of  Tolbooth,  the  common  prison,  branding  Bothwell, 
James  Balfour,  and  David  Chambers,  (a  friend  of 
the  earl)  as  the  guilty  men.  At  dead  of  night,  strange 
voices  echoed  the  same  charge  on  the  quiet  air  along 
the  streets  of  the  capital.  Placards  added  the  names 
of  the  Queen's  servants,  Bastian,  Rizzio's  brother, 
and  others,  to  the  instruments  of  crime.  Meanwhile, 
Mary  not  only  neglected  to  arrest  the  less  prominent 
conspirators,  but,  notwithstanding  the  ominous  mur- 

168 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  169 

murs  and  printed  tokens  of  indignant  opinion  around 
her  palace,  she  was  on  terms  of  familiarity  with  Both- 
well,  the  most  suspicious  and  lawless  noble  in  her 
realm.  He  followed  her  to  the  mansion  of  Lord  Se- 
ton,  where  she  went  while  the  excitement  of  the 
masses  was  increasing  every  hour.  But  the  Queen 
was  not  a  monument  of  grief,  nor  active  in  the  work 
of  securing  the  criminals.  Writes  Tytler,  who  is  an 
apologist  for  Mary :  "  It  did  not  escape  attention, 
that  scarce  two  weeks  after  her  husband's  death,  while 
in  the  country  and  in  the  city  all  were  shocked  at  the 
late  occurrences,  and  felt  them  as  a  stain  on  their  na- 
tional character,  the  court  at  Seton  was  occupied  in 
gay  amusements.  Mary  and  Bothwell  would  shoot 
at  the  butts  against  Huntley  and  Seton ;  and  on  one 
occasion,  after  winning  the  match,  they  forced  those 
lords  to  pay  the  forfeit  in  the  shape  of  a  dinner  at 
Tranent." 

Says  Mignet :  "  While  engaged  in  these  recreations, 
Mary  Stuart  was  besieged  by  the  accusing  distrust  of 
her  people,  and  the  bitter  complaints  of  the  Earl  of 
Lennox.  At  Edinburgh,  which  had  been  disturbed, 
on  the  fatal  night  of  the  9th  of  February,  by  the 
band  which  had  left  Holyrood  palace,  reports  were 
current  which  denounced  by  name  the  deviser  of  the 
assassination,  and  vaguely  indicated  his  accomplices. 
A  bill  fastened  on  the  Tron  in  the  market-place  de- 
clared that  the  smith  who  had  furnished  the  false 
keys  to  the  King's  apartment  would,  on  due  security, 
come  forward  and  point  out  his  employers.  Two  new 
placards  were  also  hung  up,  on  one  of  which  were 
written  the  Queen's  initials,  M.  R.,  with  a  hand  hold- 
ing a  sword ;  and  on  the  other  Bothwell,  with  a  mallet 


170  MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS. 

painted  above,  as  having  been  an  instrument  with 
which  the  murder  was  committed.  The  whole  city 
was  in  a  state  of  extreme  agitation.  The  Presby- 
terian ministers  preached  with  sombre  vehemence, 
calling  on  God  *  to  reveal  and  revenge.' 

"  The  Queen  was  included  in  the  suspicions  of  the 
populace,  and  the  idea  of  her  complicity  daily  gainnl 
ground.  Bothwell  became  furious,  and  attempted  to 
intimidate  public  opinion.  Accompanied  by  h'ftv 
armed  men,  he  rode  into  Edinburgh  and  publicly  de- 
clared that  if  he  knew  who  were  the  authors  of  the 
placard,  he  would  '  wash  his  hands  in  their  blood.' 
But,  animated  by  suspicion  as  much  as  by  anger, 
whenever  he  spoke  to  any  one,  of  whose  friendship 
he  was  not  assured,  he  watched  his  movements  with 
a  jealous  eye,  and  always  kept  his  hand  on  the  hilt 
of  his  dagger." 

On  the  20th  of  February,  the  Earl  of  Lennox, 
Darnley's  father,  who  had  waited  vainly  for  decisive 
measures  for  the  arrest  and  punishment  of  the  con- 
spirators, wrote  Mary  most  earnestly,  to  delay  no 
longer.  He  adds : 

"  I  am  forced  by  nature  and  duty  to  beseech  your 
majesty  most  humbly,  for  God's  cause,  and  the  honor 
of  your  majesty,  and  this  your  realm,  that  your  high- 
ness would,  with  convenient  diligence,  assemble  the 
whole  nobility  and  estates  of  your  majesty's  realm, 
and  they,  by  your  advice,  to  take  such  good  order  for 
the  perfect  trial  of  the  matter,  as  I  doubt  not  but, 
with  the  grace  of  Almighty  God,  his  Holy  Spirit  shall 
so  work  upon  the  hearts  of  your  majesty  and  all  your 
faithful  subjects,  as  the  bloody  and  cruel  actors  of 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  171 

this  deed  shall  be  manifestly  known.  And  although 
I  know  I  need  not  put  your  majesty  in  remembrance 
thereof,  the  matter  touching  your  majesty  so  near  as 
it  does,  yet  I  shall  humbly  desire  your  majesty  to 
bear  with  me,  in  troubling  your  highness  therein,  be- 
ing the  father  of  him  that  is  gone." 

The  Queen  kindly  responded,  but  adroitly  passing 
by  the  main  point,  told  him  that  the  first  business 
before  her  Parliament,  already  summoned,  would  be 
to  press  rigorously  the  investigation  of  "  the  King, 
her  husband's  cruel  slaughter." 

Meanwhile,  her  servants,  who  had  been  denounced, 
fled  from  the  kingdom ;  Powrie  and  Wilson,  at  Both- 
well's  order,  went  to  the  Castle  of  Hermitage,  on  the 
English  frontier;  while  the  Earl  of  Lennox  renewed 
his  entreaties,  urging  that  the  deed  of  darkness  was 
above  the  usual  course  of  Parliamentary  debate ;  "  of 
such  weight  and  importance,  which  ought  rather  to 
be  with  all  expedition  sought  out  and  punished  to  the 
example  of  the  whole  world." 

In  regard  to  the  placards  to  which  Lennox  alluded 
in  his  appeal,  Mary  said  in  reply,  that  while  they 
were  contradictory,  "  if  there  be  any  names  men- 
tioned in  them  that  you  think  worthy  to  suffer  a  trial, 
upon  your  advertisement,  we  shall  so 'proceed  to  the 
cognition  taking  as  may  stand  with  the  laws  of  the 
realm ;  and  being  found  culpable,  shall  see  the  punish- 
ment as  vigorously  executed,  as  the  weight  of  the 
crime  deserves." 

Elizabeth  was  not  an  indifferent  spectator  of  recent 
events.  She  sent  a  message  by  Sir  Henry  Killigrew, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

which  disclosed  her  suspicions  and  ripening  dislike 
of  Mary  Stuart : 

"  Madam,  my  ears  have  been  so  astonished,  and 
my  mind  so  grieved,  and  my  heart  so  terrified,  at 
hearing  the  horrihle  sound  of  the  abominable  murder 
of  your  late  husband  and  my  deceased  cousin,  that  I 
have  even  now  no  spirit  to  write  about  it ;  and  al- 
though my  natural  feelings  constrain  me  greatly  to 
deplore  his  death,  as  he  was  so  near  a  relation  to  me, 
nevertheless,  boldly  to  tell  you  what  I  think,  I  can- 
not conceal  from  myself  that  I  am  more  full  of  grief 
on  your  account  than  on  his.  O  madam!  I  should 
not  perform  the  part  of  a  faithful  cousin  or  an  affec- 
tionate friend,  if  I  studied  rather  to  please  your  ears 
than  to  endeavor  to  preserve  your  honor ;  therefore  I 
will  not  conceal  from  you  what  most  persons  say 
about  the  matter,  namely,  that  you  will  look  through 
your  fingers  at  taking  vengeance  for  this  deed,  and 
have  no  intention  to  touch  those  who  have  done  you 
this  kindness,  as  if  the  act  would  not  have  been  per- 
petrated unless  the  murderers  had  received  assurance 
of  their  impunity.  Think  of  me,  I  beg  you,  who 
would  not  entertain  such  a  thought  in  my  heart  for  all 
the  gold  in  the  world.  I  exhort  you,  I  advise  and  be- 
seech you  to  take  this  thing  so  much  to  heart,  as  not  to 
fear  to  bring  to  judgment  the  nearest  relation  you 
have,  and  to  let  no  persuasion  hinder  you  from  mani- 
festing  to  the  world  that  you  are  a  noble  princess,  and 
also  a  loyal  wife." 

In  France  the  impression  was  spreading  that  Mary 
was  guilty,  and  her  reverend  friend,  the  Archbishop 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  173 

of  Glasgow,  implored  her  for  her  own  sake,  to  visit 
the  merited  vengeance  upon  the  heads  of  the  regicides. 
But  the  weeks  departed,  and  nothing  was  done  by  the 
Queen  to  vindicate  her  sullied  honor. 

She  continued,  without  interruption,  her  intimacy 
with  Bothwell,  and  lavished  upon  him  royal  favors. 
She  gave  him  the  command  of  the  Castle  of  Edin- 
burgh, and  added  other  desirable  seats  to  his  posses- 
sions. Compelled  at  length,  by  the  pressure  of  re- 
monstrances and  popular  feeling,  to  abandon  the 
posture  of  indifference,  Mary  called  a  council,  of 
which  Bothwell  was  a  member,  and  with  the  consent 
of  the  nobles,  decided  to  bring  the  earl  to  trial.  With 
singular  haste,  she  ordered  Lennox  to  appear  on  the 
12th  of  April,  two  weeks  after  the  meeting  of  council, 
and  sustain  his  accusations  against  Bothwell.  Public 
rumor  had  singled  out  this  daring  favorite  of  Mary. 
No  man  was  bold  enough  to  testify  in  court  to  his 
criminality;  he  was  no  common  adversary,  and  fear 
guarded  his  person,  while  scorn  grew  intense  from  the 
dread  of  his  wrath. 

The  artizan  who  wrought  the  false  keys  to  Darn- 
ley's  chamber  refused  to  reveal  his  knowledge  of  the 
conspiracy,  because  the  security  demanded  was  not 
furnished.  Lennox  urged  that  "  the  suspected  per- 
sons continuing  still  at  liberty,  being  great  at  court, 
and  about  your  majesty's  person,  comforts  and  en- 
courages them  and  theirs,  and  discourages  all  others 
that  would  give  an  evidence  against  them." 

Elizabeth  joined  with  the  bereaved  father,  in  ad- 
vising the  same  measures,  and  sufficient  time  to  pro- 
cure evidence  which  would  convict  the  guilty.  Warn- 
ing Mary  of  the  universal  abhorrence  the  unanswered

charge  of  so  base  a  crime  would  kindle,  she  concludes, 
"  And  rather  than  this  should  happen  to  you,  I  would 
wish  you  an  honorable  burial  more  than  a  sullied  life. 
I  pray  the  Lord  to  inspire  you  to  do  what  may  most 
conduce  to  your  honor  and  the  consolation  of  your 
friends."  There  is,  in  this  wise  counsel,  a  dignified 
sense  of  queenly  honor,  and  a  real  kindness,  which 
soften  the  imperious  nature  of  the  masculine  Eliza- 
beth. 

The  infatuated  Queen  remained  unmoved  in  her 
fidelity  to  the  aspiring  Bothwell,  who  was  allowed  to 
arrange  the  preliminaries  of  a  mock  trial.  On  April 
12th,  the  day  appointed,  the  assize  opened  at  the 
Tolbooth,  before  a  jury  of  noblemen,  Bothwell's  peers 
and  partizans.  The  tribunal  was  presided  over  by 
one  of  the  fautors  of  the  murder,  the  Earl  of  Argyle, 
then  hereditary  lord  high  justice,  and  guarded  by  two 
hundred  hackbutters ;  *  while  four  thousand  of  Both- 
well's  armed  adherents  mustered  in  the  streets  and 
squares  of  Edinburgh.  The  law  officers  of  the  crown 
were  either  bribed  or  intimidated  into  silence;  no 
witnesses  were  summoned.  The  accuser,  the  Earl  of 
Lennox,  who  was  on  his  road  to  the  city,  surrounded 
by  a  large  force  of  his  friends,  received  orders  not  to 
enter  Edinburgh  with  more  than  six  in  his  company, 
and  he,  therefore,  declined  to  come  forward  in  person. 
The  accused,  the  Earl  of  Bothwell,  presented  himself 
before  the  court  of  justice  with  a  confident  and  care- 
less air.  Mounted  on  the  late  King's  favorite  horse, 
and  surrounded  by  guards,  he  was  escorted  to  the 

*  The  hackbut,  or  hagbut,  was  the  primitive  musket  or 
arquebus.  A  hackbutter  was  a  soldier  armed  with  that 
weapon.

Tolbooth,  with  base  obsequiousness,  by  a  large  num- 
ber of  gentlemen.  As  he  passed  before  the  Queen, 
who  was  standing  with  Lady  Lethington,  at  one  of  the 
windows  of  Holy  rood  Palace,  he  turned  towards  her, 
and  she  gave  him  a  friendly  greeting  for  a  farewell. 
She  expressed  her  sympathy  with  his  position  even 
more  publicly,  by  sending  him,  rather  from  impa- 
tience than  anxiety,  a  token  and  message  whilst  he 
was  before  his  judges. 

The  indefinite  indictment,  implicating  Bothwell, 
was  read  in  court;  Lennox  appeared  by  proxy,  re- 
questing farther  delay ;  the  crown  lawyers  were  mute ; 
the  earl  pleaded  not  guilty,  and  in  the  absence  of  all 
testimony,  he  was  unanimously  acquitted.  Em- 
boldened by  the  victory,  he  published  a  haughty  chal- 
lenge to  any  gentleman,  who  dared  to  whisper  against 
him  the  accusation  of  murder,  to  meet  him  in  private 
combat,  and  test  with  a  duel  their  cause.  The  arro- 
gant earl  now  swept  opposition  and  rivalry  from  his 
path  of  bloody  renown,  as  a  hunted  lion,  whose  pur- 
suers are  at  bay,  treads  proudly  on  the  crushed  foli- 
age of  his  forest  lair,  and  in  turn  looks  defiantly 
about  him  for  prey.  Mary  created  him  high  admiral, 
and  lost  no  opportunity  to  increase  his  power  and 
honors. 

Lennox  fled  to  England,  and  Murray  to  France. 

Parliament  assembled  two  days  after  the  judicial 
farce,  and  Bothwell  was  chosen,  by  Mary,  to  bear  the 
crown  and  sceptre  before  her,  when  she  entered  the 
hall  to  make  her  opening  speech.  The  sentence  of 
the  jury  was  ratified  by  the  estates  of  Scotland,  and 
the  friends  of  Bothwell  were  rewarded.  The  Queen, 
to  please  the  earl  and  conciliate  the  Presbyterians, 


1  7»;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

abolished  all  statutes  restricting  the  free  enjoyment 
of  divine  worship  :i&lt;-c»nlint:  to  the  conscience  of  her 
Protestant  subjects,  ;m&lt;l  made  provision  for  the  poor 
clergy.  But  the  stern  Puritans  were  not  so  bribed, 
and  maintained  their  attitude  of  condemnation  of 
both  herself,  and  the  infamous  noble,  whose  attentions 
to  her  were  growing  daily  more  offensive  to  her  peo- 
ple. Even  the  market  women  would  exclaim,  as  Mary 
passed,  *'  God  preserve  your  grace,  if  you  are  sock- 
less  *  of  the  King's  death." 

Bothwell  had  reached  an  elevation,  from  which  he 
gazed  upward  to  the  dazzling  summit  of  his  hopes, 
with  but  two  intervening  objects — his  wife,  and  the 
young  prince.  A  divorce  would  remove  the  first,  and 
the  second  he  believed  would  disappear  after  he  had 
secured  the  hand  of  Mary.  These  vaulting  deeds 
were  anticipated  by  discerning  observers.  Bothwell's 
might  and  revenge  prevented  the  utterance  to  the 
Queen  of  the  distressful  apprehension.  Txml  Herries, 
however,  with  great  moral  courage,  traveled  with  the 
speed  of  a  courier  to  Edinburgh,  and  licsought  her 
not  to  marry  a  man  universally  thought  to  be  the 
assassin  of  the  King.  Mary  affected  surprise,  and 
denied  the  story.  Failing  in  his  mission,  Lord  Her- 
ries hastened  from  the  danger  while  in  Bothwell's 
reach,  and  by  relays  of  horses,  escaped  to  his  distant 
castle. 

Melvil  also  mentioned  the  exciting  subject  to  the1 

QIHMMI,  who  related  the  interview  to  Bothwell.     The 

cautious  Lcthington  apprised  Melvil  of  his  perilous 

loyalty,  in  the  following  conversation :  "  So  soon  as 

*  Innocent. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  177 

the  Earl  Bothwell  gets  word,  as  I  fear  he  will,  he  will 
not  fail  to  slay  you.  I  pray  you  retire  with  dili- 
gence." "It 'is  a  sore  matter/'  replied  Melvil,  "to 
see  that  good  princess  run  to  utter  wreck,  and  nobody 
to  forewarn  her."  "  You  have  done  more  honestly 
than  wisely,"  said  Lethington. 

Bothwell  was  enraged,  and  sought  Melvil's  life, 
who  secreted  himself  until  Mary  had  calmed  his  pas- 
sions. The  earl  went  fearlessly  forward  with  his  de- 
signs. On  the  19th  of  April,  when  Parliament  rose, 
he  invited  to  a  banquet  the  Earls  of  Morton,  Argyle, 
Huntley,  Cassilis,  Glencairn,  Rothes,  Sutherland, 
Caithness,  and  Eglinton,  with  Lords  Boyd,  Seton, 
Sinclair,  Semple,  Oliphant,  Oglivy,  Ross,  Haccat, 
Carlile,  Hume,  Inverneith,  and  others.  Bothwell 
then  informed  the  assembly,  that,  with  the  Queen's 
consent  already  given,  he  designed  to  marry  her,  and 
desired  their  assent. 

The  place  of  festivity  was  environed  with  armed 
men,  to  overawe  the  guests.  There  was  a  sudden 
change  in  the  aspect  of  that  brilliant  array  of  nobil- 
ity, and  agitation  was  visible  on  all  faces  but  the 
tyrant's,  on  whom  they  gazed  with  silent  submission. 
The  Earl  of  Eglinton,  in  the  commotion  of  the  suc- 
ceeding moments,  made  his  escape.  The  rest  bowed 
to  the  dictation  of  the  successful  admirer  of  their 
Queen,  and  the  jeweled  crown  she  wore. 

The  memorial  of  the  nobles,  praying  the  Queen  to 
marry  Bothwell,  after  vindicating  him  in  the  Darn- 
ley  affair,  as  a  man  "  slandered  by  his  evil  willers 
and  privy  enemies ;  "  and  enumerating  his  ancient 
honors,  closes  with  this  passage : 

"  In  moreover  weighing  and  considering  the  time,

Mary  had  given  her  signature  to  a  promise  of  mar- 

i-  follows  : 


"  We,  Mary,  by  the  grace  of  God,  Queen  of  Scot- 
land, Dowager  of  France,  &amp;c.,  promise  faithfully, 
sincerely,  and  without  constraint,  James  Hepburn, 
Earl  of  Boduil,  never  to  have  any  other  spouse  and 
husband  but  him,  and  to  take  him  for  such  whenever 
he  shall  require,  in  spite  of  the  opposition  of  rela- 
tion, friend,  or  any  others;  and  as  God  has  taken  my 
late  husband,  Henry  Stewart,  called  Darnley,  and  in 
consequence  I  am  free,  not  being  under  the  authority 
or  either  father  or  mother;  I,  therefore,  protest  that 
he,  having  the  same  liberty,  I  shall  be  ready  to  per- 
form the  ceremony  requisite  for  marriage,  which  I 
promise  him  before  God,  whom  I  call  you  to  witness, 
and  the  subjoined  signature,  by  my  hand,  written 
this  .  .  . 

"  MART  R." 

Bothwell,  in  the  meantime,  began  to  exhibit  his  un- 
restrained temper  in  uncivil  deportment  towards 
Mary,  and  insisted  on  the  substitution  of  his  sister  in 
the  place  of  Lady  Beres,  the  Queen's  confidant.  An 
extract  from  a  letter  to  the  earl  will  show  the  humil- 
iating thraldom  of  her  heart  :  "  I  will  take  such  (ser- 
vants) as  shall  content  you  for  their  conditions.  I 
beseech  you  that  an  opinion  of  another  person  be  not 
hurtful  in  your  mind  to  my  constancy.  Mistrust  me 
but  when  I  will  put  you  out  of  doubt,  and  clear  my- 
self. Refuse  it  not,  my  dear  life,  and  suffer  me  to 
make  you  some  proof  by  my  obedience,  my  faithful- 
ness, constancy,  and  voluntary  subjection."  Among 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

the  secret  letters  of  the  silver  casket,*  whose  authen- 
ticity, though  denied  by  partizans  of  Mary,  has  not 
been  disproved,  was  found  a  contract,  dated  a  week 
before  Bothwell's  acquittal,  signed  by  her,  commit- 
ting herself  to  the  marriage.  It  was  too  recently  that 
Uarnley  was  buried  to  permit  a  wedding,  and  the 
only  alternative  was  the  resort  to  a  ruse.  It  was  ar- 
ranged that  the  earl  should  intercept  the  Queen,  upon 
her  return  from  a  visit  to  the  prince  at  Stirling 
Castle,  and  with  a  superior  force  make  her  his  cap- 
tive. 

This  would. afford  an  apology  for  submission,  and 
slope  the  way  to  his  feet,  where  she  was  panting  to 
resign  person  and  will  to  the  embrace  of  her  Moloch. 
Huntley,  who  was  entrusted  with  the  secret,  used  his 
persuasion  to  change  her  purpose.  She  immediately 
communicated  her  distrust  of  him  to  the  earl.  "  He 
preached  to  me  that  it  was  a  foolish  enterprise,  and 

*  These  are  known  as  the  Casket  Letters.  The  Earl  of 
Bothwell,  on  leaving  Edinburgh  for  the  Borders,  left  in  the 
hands  of  Balfour,  a  silver  casket  which  Mary  had  brought 
with  her  from  France.  Among  the  writings  found  in  this 
casket  was  evidence  of  Mary's  plotting  against  the  life  of 
Elizabeth.  The  charge,  by  the  partizans  of  Mary,  that  the 
letters  were  forged  was  an  afterthought,  as  no  such  plea  was 
made  during  the  debate  upon  the  question  in  Parliament. 
Froude  says  that,  had  they  been  able  to  prove  forgery,  or 
even  plausibly  to  assert  it,  the  whole  of  Europe  would  at  once 
have  been  declared  on  Mary's  side.  See  below,  pp.  212-214. 

On  the  other  hand,  Andrew  Lang  concludes  a  full  discus- 
sion of  the  subject,  in  an  article  in  Blackwood's  Magazine  for 
December,  1890,  in  these  words  :  "  I  began  this  paper  strong 
in  the  faith  that  the  Casket  Letters  were  genuine.  I  end  it 
in  doubt !  "  See  also  below,  pp.  212-214.  See  also  Dublin 
Review,  66  :  123. 


182  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

that  with  mine  honor  I  could  never  marry  you  seeing 
that  being  married  you  did  carry  me  away,  and  that 
his  folks  would  not  suffer  it,  and  that  the  lords  would 
unsay  themselves,  and  would  deny  that  they  had  said. 
I  told  him  that,  seeing  I  was  come  so  far,  if  you  did 
not  withdraw  yourself  of  yourself,  that  no  persua- 
sion, nor  death  itself,  should  make  me  fail  of  my 
promise." 

Again  she  addresses  him  on  the  subject  of  the  ab- 
duction with  enthusiasm :  '*  As  for  the  handling  of 
myself,  I  heard  it  once  well  devised.  Methinks  that 
your  services  and  long  friendship,  having  the  good 
will  of  the  lords,  do  well  deserve  a  pardon,  if  above 
the  duty  of  a  subject  you  advance  yourself,  not  to 
constrain  me,  but  to  assure  yourself  of  such  high 
place  nigh  unto  me,  that  other  admonitions,  or  for- 
eign persuasions  may  not  let  (hinder)  me  from  con- 
senting to  that  that  you  hope  your  service  shall  make 
you  one  day  to  attain ;  and  to  be  short,  to  make  your- 
self sure  of  the  lords,  and  free  to  marry;  and  that 
you  are  constrained  for  your  safety,  and  to  be  able  to 
serve  me  faithfully,  to  use  an  humble  request,  joined 
to  an  importunate  action." 

There  were  unforsecn  obstacles  to  the  success  of  the 
stratagem,  which  appeared  as  the  time  appointed  ap- 
proached. The  Earl  of  Sutherland  declared  that 
death  was  preferable  to  the  Queen's  capture  while 
under  his  protection ;  and  Iluntley  was  fearful  of  be- 
iiii;  accused  of  infidelity  and  treachery  in  the  adven- 
ture. Mary  apprized  Bothwell  of  these  annoyances, 
and  concludes: 

"  I  have  thought  good  to  advertise  you  of  the  fear 
he  hath,  that  he  should  be  charged  and  accused  of 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  183 

treason,  to  the  end  that,  without  mistrusting  him,  you 
may  be  the  more  circumspect,  and  that  you  may  have 
the  more  power;  for  we  had  yesterday  more  than 
three  hundred  horse  of  his  and  of  Livingston's.  Eor 
the  honor  of  God  be  accompanied  rather  with  more 
than  less ;  for  that  is  the  principal  of  my  care." 

April  21st,  1567,  Mary  Stuart  proceeded  to  Stir- 
ling Castle.  The  Earl  of  Mar,  who  had  charge  of 
young  James,  from  some  suspicion,  refused  admission 
to  more  than  two  ladies  with  the  Queen,  into  the 
royal  apartment.  The  24th  she  left  Stirling  for 
Edinburgh,  and  at  Almond  Bridge  was  met  by  Both- 
well's  force  of  six  hundred  horsemen.  He  seized 
Mary's  horse  by  the  bridle,  and  led  her,  without  con- 
flict, to  his  Castle  of  Dunbar.  Huntley,  Melvil,  and 
Lethington  were  taken  with  her  into  captivity.  When 
Melvil  complained  of  the  rude  treatment,  Captain 
Blacater  replied  that  it  was  with  the  Queen's  consent. 
This  royal  and  romantic  forage  of  the  earl  was  the 
first  act  in  the  drama  of  guilty  and  suicidal  passion ; 
the  next  was  the  divorce  of  Lady  Jane  Gordon,  Both- 
well's  wife.  The  Archbishop  of  St.  Andrews  was 
bribed  to  give  the  sentence  of  his  court  favorably; 
and  on  the  3d  of  May,  the  Catholic  church,  in  behalf 
of  Mary,  and  the  Presbyterian  church  for  the  Protes- 
tant earl,  declared  the  sentence  of  divorce. 

The  same  day  the  Queen  returned  to  Edinburgh, 
with  her  accustomed  cheerfulness  and  pageantry. 
When  she  came  to  the  gates  of  the  city,  Bothwell, 
with  great  respect,  laid  his  hand  on  the  bridle  of 
Mary's  horse,  and  his  soldiers  then  threw  down  their 
spears,  as  the  signal  that  their  sovereign  was  not  only 
free,  but  her  lover  was  no  more  than  a  humble,  un-

protected  servant  of  her  majesty.  The  Queen  ex- 
pressed publicly  her  unconditional  pardon  of  Both- 
well,  and  her  determination  to  marry  him.  Notwith- 
standing the  universal  anticipation  of  the  event,  the 
distinct  avowal  of  it  by  Mary  Stuart  sent  a  wave  of 
burning  indignation  over  the  realm.  When  the  order 
to  publish  the  bans  of  marriage  was  sent  to  the  Re- 
formed church,  there  was  a  prompt  and  spirited  re- 
fusal. Knox  was  in  England ;  Craig,  his  representa- 
tive, gave  the  reason,  that  the  Queen  had  not  trans- 
mitted a  written  command.  The  justice  clerk  imme- 
diately furnished  the  paper,  and  Craig  desired  to 
meet  the  privy  council.  This  was  granted ;  and  when 
the  fearless  man  of  God  confronted  Bothwell,  it  was 
like  the  meeting  of  the  Hebrew  prophet  and  Ahab, 
while  the  sanguinary  monarch  quailed  before  the 
fiery  denunciations  of  the  untremulous  reprover.  He 
charged  home  upon  the  astonished  noble  his  crimes, 
and  set  before  him  "  righteousness,  temperance,  and  a 
judgment  to  come."  Having  cleared  his  conscience, 
he  read  in  the  sanctuary  the  hated  bans,  and  added : 
"  I  take  heaven  and  earth  to  witness,  that  I  abhor 
and  detest  this  marriage,  as  odious  and  slanderous  to 
the  world,  and  I  would  exhort  the  faithful  to  pray 
earnestly  that  a  union  against  all  reason  and  good 
conscience  may  yet  be  overruled  by  God,  to  the  com- 
fort of  this  unhappy  realm." 

Unmoved  in  her  delirium  of  love  by  outward  com- 
motion, Mary,  on  the  12th  of  May,  appeared  in  the 
High  Court  of  Edinburgh,  and  made  a  declaration  of 
her  entire  reconciliation  to  Bothwell,  and  her  inten- 
tion to  increase  his  honors.  He  was  made  Duke  of 
Orkney  and  Shetland,  receiving  the  coronet  from  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  185 

hand  of  the  Queen.  Two  days  later,  she  signed  the 
marriage  contract ;  and  the  next  morning  at  4  o'clock 
the  nuptials  were  celebrated  in  Holyrood  Palace  ac- 
cording to  Catholic  form,  and  in  the  Protestant 
church  by  Bishop  of  Orkney.  The  attendance  of  the 
nobility  was  small,  and  there  was  in  the  event,  instead 
of  joy  heralding  future  good  to  the  popular  mind, 
something  deeply  ominous  of  coming  evil.  The  tid- 
ings spread  with  the  morning  light,  like  a  political 
and  moral  eclipse,  darkening  the  land.  On  the  palace 
gates  was  found  this  significant  line  from  Ovid: 

"  Mense  malas  maio  nubere  vulgus  ait." 

It  is  not  strange  that  with  such  tokens,  an  unholy 
alliance,  consummated  within  three  months  after 
Darnley's  death,  the  wedding  day  should  be  distin- 
guished by  a  domestic  quarrel.  De  Croc  wrote  to 
Catherine  and  Charles  IX.,  of  France,  on  the  revolt- 
ing affair : 

''  Your  majesties  could  not  do  better  than  be  very 
displeased  with  the  marriage,  for  it  is  a  very  unfor- 
tunate one,  and  already  is  repented  of.  On  Thursday 
(May  15th)  her  majesty  sent  for  me  to  inquire 
whether  I  had  perceived  any  strangeness  between  her 
and  her  husband ;  which  she  wished  to  excuse  to  me, 
saying,  that  if  I  saw  she  was  sorrowful,  it  was  because 
she  would  not  rejoice,  as  she  says  she  never  will  again, 
and  desires  only  death.  Yesterday  (May  16th)  be- 
ing both  in  a  closet  with  the  Earl  of  Bothwell,  she 
called  out  aloud  for  some  one  to  give  her  a  knife  that 
she  might  kill  herself.  Those  who  were  in  the  adjoin- 


186  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

in-  room  heard  her.    They  think  that  unless  God  aids 
her,  she  will  fall  into  despair." 

The  storm  passed,  and  Mary  dispatched  ambassa- 
dors to  foreign  courts  to  obtain  their  recognition  of  * 
Bothwell  as  her  lawful  husband.  She  affirmed  that 
her  nobility  urged  the  marriage,  and  the  brilliant 
qualities  of  the  faithful  lord  entitled  him  to  the  dis- 
tinction. Apologizing  for  Bothwell's  violence,  she- 
directed  the  Bishop  of  Dumblane,  commissioned  to 
France  and  Rome,  to  add  that  the  civil  commotions 
in  her  kingdom  made  an  alliance  with  a  foreign 
prince  impossible,  while  among  her  own  subjects  the 
Earl  of  Bothwell  was  prominent,  incomparably  so,  in 
wisdom,  heroism,  and  ancestral  honors.  She  there- 
fore yielded  without  repugnance  to  the  wish  of  the 
three  estates  of  her  realm.  Melvil,  who  went  to  the 
court  of  Elizabeth,  was  to  offer  Bothwell's  acquittal 
in  reply  to  the  suspicion  of  his  connection  with  Darn- 
ley's  murder,  and  his  legal  divorce,  in  answer  to 
the  charge  of  marrying  while  another  wife  was 
living. 

Bothwell  wrote  to  the  Queen  of  England  in  a  royal 
strain.  He  said:  "  Men  of  greater  birth  might  have 
been  preferred  to  the  high  station  I  now  occupy,  but 
none  could  have  been  chosen  more  zealous  for  the 
preservation  of  your  majesty's  friendship,  of  which 
von  shall  have  experience  at  any  time  it  may  be  your 
pleasure  to  employ  me."  Having  gathered  into  his 
hands  the  reins  of  authority  in  Scotland,  he  anticipa- 
ted quick  success  in  the  endeavor  to  gain  the  favor 
of  the  adjacent  powers.  But  beneath  this  apparent 
calm,  were  dark  and  turbulent  elements  of  retribu- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  187 

tion.  The  triumphs  of  lawless  affection  and  advanc- 
ing greatness  were  like  the  delusive  tranquillity  and 
glare  of  a  torrid  day,  when  it  is  the  prelude  to  an 
earthquake's  desolating  march.  A  league,  dating 
back  before  the  marriage  of  Mary,  had  bound  together 
in  confederation  against  Bothwell,  the  principal  no- 
bles of  Scotland.  And  now  that  Bothwell  aspired  to 
remove  the  prince  from  his  path  of  homicidal  glory, 
and  the  might  to  do  it  was  already  in  his  grasp,  the 
slumbering  rebellion  awoke.  It  was  the  ripe  harvest 
of  embittered  feeling  which  the  Laird  of  Grange  had 
expressed  in  a  communication  to  Earl  of  Bedford, 
about  the  time  of  Mary's  seizure  by  Bothwell :  "  This 
Queen  will  never  cease  unto  such  time  as  she  have 
wrecked  all  the  honest  men  of  this  realm.  She  was 
minded  to  cause  Bothwell  to  ravish  (seize)  her,  to  the 
end  that  she  may  the  sooner  end  the  marriage  which 
she  promised  before  she  caused  Bothwell  to  murder 
her  husband.  There  is  many  that  would  revenge  the 
murder,  but  they  fear  your  mistress.  I  am  so. suited 
for  to  enterprize  the  revenge,  that  I  must  either  take 
it  upon  hand,  or  else  I  must  leave  the  country,  the 
which  I  am  determined  to  do,  if  I  can  obtain  license. 
I  pray  your  lordship,  let  me  know  what  your  mistress 
will  do,  for  if  we  will  seek  France,  we  may  find  favor 
at  their  hands."  In  a  letter  addressed  a  few  days 
later  to  Bedford,  he  gives  an  outline  of  the  proposed 
campaign : 

"  The  heads  that  presently  they  agreed  upon,  is, 
first,  to  seek  the  liberty  of  the  Queen,  who  is  rav- 
ished and  detained  by  the  Earl  of  Bothwell,  who  was 
the  ravishor,  and  hath  the  strengths,  munitions  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

men  of  war  at  his  commandment.  The  next  bead  is, 
the  preservation  and  keeping  of  the  prince.  The 
third  is,  to  pursue  them  that  murdered  the  King. 
For  the  pursuit  of  these  three  heads,  they  have  prom- 
ised to  bestow  their  lives,  lands  and  goods.  And  to 
that  effect  their  lordships  have  desired  me  to  write 
unto  your  lordship,  to  the  end  they  might  hqve  your 
sovereign's  aid  and  support  for  suppressing  of  the 
cruel  murderer,  Both  well,  who,  at  the  Queen's  last 
being  in  Stirling,  suborned  certain  to  have  poisoned 
the  prince ;  for  that  barbarous  tyrant  is  not  contented 
to  have  murdered  the  father,  but  he  would  also  cut 
off  the  son,  for  fear  that  he  hath  to  be  punished  here- 
after. The  names  of  the  lords  that  convened  in  Stir- 
ling was  the  Earls  of  Argyle,  Morton,  Athol,  and 

Mar There  is  to  be  joined  with  the  four 

forenamed  lords,  the  Earls  of  Glencairn,  Cassilis, 
Eglinton,  Montrose,  Caithness;  the  Lords  Boyd, 
Ochiltree,  Ruthven,  Drummond,  Gray,  Glammis,  In- 
nermeith,  Lindsay,  Hume  and  Herries." 

As  an  index  of  the  prevalent  disaffection,  there  is 
the  fact  of  Melvil's  connection  with  the  civil  out- 
break, who  was  Mary's  favorite,  and  minister  to  Eng- 
land just  before  the  open  revolt.  He  united  his  ap- 
peal with  the  lairds  to  Elizabeth,  for  aid  in  avenging 
*  the  King's  death,  and  touched  a  chord  of  anxious  in- 
terest, by  intimating  that  France  would  come  to  their 
fyelp,  if  she  refused. 

In  the  secret  instructions  of  Charles  IX.  to  De 
Croc,  we  have  a  glimpse  of  Mary's  reputation  in  hia 
court,  and  his  purpose,  rather  than  let  Scotland  be 
absorbed  by  England,  to  desert  the  Queen,  and  assist 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  189 

the  rebellious  nobles.  "  The  said  Sieur  de  Villeroy 
will  say,  that  his  majesty  having  made  known  to  him 
the  opinion  which  he  entertains  of  the  pitiable  suc- 
cess of  the  affairs  of  the  Queen  of  Scotland,  seeing 
what  has  been  written  to  him  of  her  behavior  by  the 
said  Sieur  de  Croc,  and  the  strange  news  which  he 
has  received  from  other  quarters ;  and  being  also  con- 
cerned that  the  enterprise  of  the  said  lords  is  secretly 
assisted  and  favored  by  the  English — whose  charity 
would  only  entail  their  ruin — the  King  wishes  the 
said  Sieur  de  Croc  to  know,  that  the  desire  and  prin- 
cipal intention  of  his  majesty  is  to  keep  the  kingdom 
of  Scotland  in  its  attachment  to  himself,  without  per- 
mitting it,  under  the  pretext  of  the  many  follies 
which  are  committed,  to  rebel  and  alienate  itself  from 
its  attachment  to  himself,  as  it  is  certain  it  would  do 
toward  the  said  English,  whom  the  said  lords  would 
seek  as  their  protectors  in  this  affair,  if  they  saw  they 
would  have  no  assurance  from  the  King." 

De  Croc  accordingly  offered  men  and  munitions  of 
war  to  the  revolutionary  party,  who  also  sought  the 
favor  of  Elizabeth.  Her  policy  fluctuated  between 
her  cherished  opposition  to  the  rebellion  of  subjects 
against  their  prince,  and  her  apprehension  of  French 
influence  and  strength  in  Scotland.  She  abhorred 
civil  revolt,  but  she  feared  France  more ;  and  Melvil 
received  intimations  that  the  confederates  might  an- 
ticipate aid  from  the  Queen  of  England. 

Although  the  forces  of  the  nobility  augmented 
daily,  Mary  was  fearless,  in  her  ignorance  of  their 
movements,  of  impending  danger.  Bothwell,  by  an 
attempt  to  assassinate  Lethington,  had  driven  him  to 
the  protection  of  his  friend,  the  Earl  of  Athol,  where

% 

he  planned  the  furtherance  of  the  formidable  league. 
Meanwhile,  the  demand  was  made  by  the  successor  of 
Darnley,  for  the  control  of  young  James.  The  Earl 
of  Mar,  his  guardian,  refused,  unless  the  prince  were 
placed  in  Edinburgh  Castle,  under  the  care  of  an  hon- 
orable, irreproachable  governor.  But  this  ambitious 
design  was  checked  by  the  distinct  tokens  of  battle. 
Mary  was  at  Borthwick  Castle,  ten  miles  from  the 
capital,  whither  she  went  to  escape  the  troubled  at- 
mosphere of  her  follies.  The  nobles  had  disregarded 
her  summons  to  engage  in  a  campaign  to  the  frontier, 
under  the  command  of  Bothwell ;  and  he  hastened  in 
alarm  to  the  Queen.  Barely  had  he  arrived,  when 
the  Earls  of  Morton,  Montrose,  and  others,  leading  an 
army  of  ten  thousand  horsemen,  marched  toward 
Borthwick  Castle.  Lord  Hume  pressed  on  in  ad- 
vance of  the  main  force,  with  eight  hundred  men,  to 
seize  Bothwell  by  surprise.  He  had,  however,  es- 
caped and  on  the  10th  of  June,  Mary,  disguised  in 
male  apparel,  under  cover  of  darkness,  fled  on  horse- 
back, and  rejoining  Bothwell  a  few  miles  distant, 
rodo  with  him  to  his  Castle  of  Dunbar,  which  they 
entered  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning,  fully  con- 
scious that  something  more  than  royal  pastime  was  be- 
fore them.  The  revolutionists,  thwarted  in  their  first 
!&gt;&lt;»M  push  to  the  enclosure  of  sovereignty,  moved 
&lt;lo\vn  ujxm  Edinburgh.  Along  the  line  of  march  ad- 
ditions were  made  to  their  ranks,  until,  when,  on  the 
11  th  of  Juno,  they  arrived  at  the  metropolis,  they 
muabowd  thm-  thousand  armed  soldiers.  The  citi- 
/&lt;  us  proclaimed  tlioir  adherence  to  the  cause  of  the 
confederates. 

James  Balfour,  who  had  been  left  by  Bothwell  in 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  191 

command  of  the  castle,  instead  of  directing  his  ord- 
nance against  the  rebels,  signified  his  willingness  to 
enter  the  league.  Immediately,  the  triumphant  in- 
vaders issued  the  following  proclamation : 

"  That  whereas,  the  Queen's  majesty,  being  de- 
tained in  captivity,  was  neither  able  to  govern  her 
realm,  nor  try  the  murder  of  her  husband,  we  of  the 
nobility  and  council  command  all  the  subjects,  spec- 
ially the  burghers  of  Edinburgh,  to  assist  the  said 
noblemen  and  council  in  delivering  the  Queen  and 
preserving  the  prince,  and  in  trying  and  punishing 
the  King's  murderers.  And  we  command  the  lords  of 
session,  commissaries,  and  all  other  judges,  to  sit  and 
do  justice  according  to  the  laws  of  this  realm,  not- 
withstanding any  tumult  that  may  arise  in  the  time 
of  this  enterprise ;  with  certification  to  all  who  shall 
be  found  acting  contrary  to  these  proceedings,  that 
they  shall  be  reputed  as  fautors  of  the  said  murder, 
and  punished  as  traitors." 

The  order  was  then  given  to  march  against  Both- 
well,  who  was  charged  with  violence  toward  the 
Queen,  an  unlawful  marriage,  murder,  and  designs 
upon  the  prince  royal.  In  two  days,  Mary  and  Both- 
well  had  gathered  twenty-five  hundred  men,  and  left 
Dunbar  on  the  14th  of  June,  reaching,  the  next  day, 
Gladsmoor,  when  the  Queen  made  to  her  diminutive 
army  the  following  address : 

"  That  a  number  of  conspirators,  having  discovered 
the  latest  motive,  borne  to  her  and  the  Duke  of  Ork- 
ney, her  husband,  after  they  had  failed  in  apprehend- 


192  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

in;:  their  persons  at  Borthwiek,  had  made  a  seditious 
proclamation  to  make  the  people  believe  that  they 
did  seek  the  revenge  of  the  murder  of  the  King,  her 
late  hushand,  and  the  relieving  of  herself  out  of  bon- 
dage and  captivity,  pretending  that  the  duko,  her 
husband,  was  minded  to  invade  the  prince,  her  son; 
'ill  which  wore  false  and  forged  inventions,  none  hav- 
ing better. cause  to  revenge  the  King's  death  than 
herself,  if  she  could  know  the  authors  thereof.  And 
for  the  duke,  her  present  husband,  he  had  used  all 
means  to  clear  his  innocence,  the  ordinary  justice  hud 
absolved  him,  and  the  estates  of  Parliament  approved 
their  proceedings,  which  they  themselves  that  made 
the  present  insurrection  had  likewise  allowed.  As, 
also,  he  had  offered  to  maintain  that  quarrel  against 
any  gentleman  on  earth  undefamed,  than  which  noth- 
ing more  could  be  required.  And  as  to  her  alleged 
captivity,  the  contrary  was  known  to  the  whole  sub- 
jects, her  marriage  with  him  being  publicly  con- 
tracted and  solemnized,  with  their  own  consents,  as 
their  hand-writs  could  testify.  Albeit,  to  give  their 
treason  a  fair  show,  they  made  now  a  buckler  of  the 
prince,  her  son,  being  an  infant,  and  in  their  hands ; 
whereas  their  intention  only  was  to  overthrow  her 
and  her  posterity,  that  they  might  rule  all  things  at 
their  pleasure,  and  without  controlment." 

With  promises  of  reward  for  loyalty,  the  Queen 
rode  forward  beneath  the  folds  of  the  royal  standard, 
attired  in  a  red  dress,  which  reached  only  to  her 
knees.  She  reached  Carberry  Hill,  six  miles  from 
the  capital,  and  took  her  position.  The  hostile  army, 
having  heard  of  her  progress,  hastened  before  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  193 

break  of  day,  Sunday  morning,  toward  the  entrench- 
ments of  their  beautiful  and  resolute  sovereign.  On 
one  of  their  banners  was  pictured  the  slain  Darnley, 
lying  beneath  the  tree  where  he  was  found,  with  the 
prince  kneeling  beside  the  ghastly  form,  and  under 
the  exciting  scene  was  the  motto,  "  Judge  and  avenge 
my  cause,  O  Lord !  "  The  flaunting  colors  sent  a 
thrill  of  fearful  enthusiasm  through  the  ranks,  and 
visibly  moved  the  populace.  The  insurgents  threw 
up  their  fortifications  on  the  heights  of  Musselburgh, 
about  a  mile  from  Carberry  Hill.  A  little  stream 
ran  between  the  foes,  who  lay  in  full  view  of  each 
other.  Not  greatly  unequal  in  numbers,  they  were 
more  widely  different  in  character  and  feeling.  The 
nobility  and  the  ardor  were  both  against  Mary  Stuart. 
There  was  along  the  lines  of  the  confederates,  where 
shone  the  badges  of  haughty  earls  and  powerful 
barons,  a  furnace-glow  of  revenge — a  panting  to  pun- 
ish murder,  and  subdue  a  scorned  usurper. 

At  this  crisis,  De  Croc,  the  French  ambassador, 
endeavored,  in  the  name  of  Charles,  his  king,  to  con- 
ciliate the  parties,  and  save  a  bloody  conflict.  The 
lords  offered  to  withdraw  from  the  battle-field,  if  the 
Queen  would  at  once  and  forever  separate  herself 
from  the  odious  Bothwell.  They  offered  further,  to 
meet  him  in  single  combat,  according  to  his  former 
challenge,  if  he  would  come  forth  between  the  armies. 
De  Croc  unwillingly  bore  the  terms  of  loyalty  to 
Mary.  He  crossed  the  valley,  and  found  the  Queen 
sitting  on  a  green  mound,  her  features  kindling  with 
determination  and  hope.  After  the  usual  salutations, 
he  began  by  representing  the  nobles  as  still  her  true, 
though  offended  subjects,  when  Mary  interrupted 

13

with  these  words:  "They  show  tlu-ir  affection  very 
ill,  by  running  counter  to  what  they  have  signed, 
and  by  accusing  the  man  whom  they  acquitted,  and  to 
whom  they  married  MM-." 

She  expressed  a  readiness  to  receive  them  upon  du- 
tiful submission.  "  At  this  moment  Bothwell  came 
up.  'Is  it  of  me  that  they  complain  ? '  he  said  to  De 
Croc,  in  a.voice  loud  enough  to  be  heard  by  his  army. 
'  I  have  just  been  speaking  to  them,'  replied  De  Croc 
as  loudly,  '  and  they  have  assured  me  that  they  are 
the  Queen's  very  humble  subjects  and  servants;  and 
your  mortal  enemies,'  he  a«l»lrd  in  a  lower  tone, '  since 
you  will  know  it.'  '  What  have  I  done  to  them  ?  ' 
answered  Bothwell  in  the  same  tone,  as  if  desirous  to 
communicate  his  own  assurance  to  those  who  heard 
him,  and  did  not  feel  so  bold  as  himself.  *  I  have 
never  caused  displeasure  to  a  single  one  of  them ;  on 
the  contrary,  I  have  sought  to  consult  them  all.  What 
tlu'V  are  doing  is  out  of  envy  for  my  greatness.  For- 
tune is  free  to  any  who  can  receive  her ;  and  there  is 
not  a  man  among  them  who  would  not  like  to  be  in 
my  place.'  He  then  proposed,  in  order  to  prevent 
bloodshed,  to  fight  between  the  two  armies,  although 
he  had  had  the  honor  to  espouse  the  Queen,  any  of  his 
enemies  who  might  leave  their  ranks,  provided  he 
were  a  gentleman.  The  Queen  opposed  this  proposi- 
tion, saying  that  she  would  not  allow  anything  of  the 
kind,  and  that  his  quarrel  was  hers  also." 

By  this  time,  the  army  in  rebellion  had  passed  the 
stream,  and  Bothwell  retired  to  join  his  standard,  and 
De  Croc  went  to  Morton  and  Glencairn,  with  the  of- 
fer of  pardon,  if  they  would  obey  their  Queen.  "  We 
have  not  come  here,"  said  Glencairn,  "  to  solicit  par- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  195 

don  for  ourselves,  but  rather  to  give  it  to  those  who 
have  offended."  "  We  are  in  arms,"  added  Morton, 
"  not  against  the  Queen,  but  against  the  Duke  of 
Orkney,  the  murderer  of  her  husband.  Let  him  be 
delivered  up,  or  let  her  majesty  remove  him  from  her 
company,  and  we  shall  yield  her  obedience." 

Donning  their  casques,  they  ended  the  parley,  and 
De  Croc  repaired  to  Edinburgh.  Each  army,  accord- 
ing to  usage,  dismounted,  and  prepared  to  fight  on 
foot.  The  royal  force  were  irresolute,  and  demanded 
a  personal  combat  between  Bothwell  and  a  champion 
from  the  enemy.  The  daring  duke  consented.  Mary 
was  compelled  to  submit,  because  her  ranks  were 
failing.  After  rejecting  the  Laird  of  Tullibardine 
on  account  of  inferior  rank,  Bothwell  selected  Mor- 
ton, who  immediately  prepared  to  contend  with  two- 
handed  swords.  Lindsay  demanded  the  honor,  as  a 
servant  of  the  assassinated  King,  and  kneeling  in 
view  of  the  whole  army,  prayed  in  a  clear  voice  for 
strength  to  vanquish  his  guilty  foe.  While  Mary  was 
hesitating  whether  to  permit  the  duel,  her  soldiers 
were  deserting;  a  detachment  of  confederates  had 
swept  around  the  hill,  cutting  off  the  possibility  of 
Bothwell's  retreat  toward  Dunbar.  Mary  yielded  to 
the  emergency,  and  consented  to  dismiss  the  duke,  her 
husband,  and  attend  the  insurgents  to  the  capital,  on 
the  terms  of  his  safe  return  to  Dunbar,  and  their  re- 
newed obedience.  Then  followed  a  brief  and  affect- 
ing interview  between  Mary  and  Bothwell  on  Car- 
berry  Hill.  Mutual  pledges  of  fidelity  were  given, 
and  mounting  his  horse  in  company  with  a  few 
friends,  he  rode  fleetly  toward  his  castle.  The  separ- 
ation, though  neither  knew  it,  was  final.  Sorrow-

fully,  yet  confidingly,  Mary  approached  the  Laird 
of  Grange,  who  had  hemmed  in  Bothwcll  just  Ix-fore 
by  his  military  maixeuvre.  and  extending  IMT  deli- 
eate  hand,  which  lie  kissed,  submitted  to  his  guidance. 
1 1.  took  flu-  bridle  of  her  horse  and  conducted  her  into 
the  bosom  of  the  opposing  army.  They  r&lt;  \&lt; ivntly 
received  the  Queen,  who  said: 

"  My  lords,  I  am  come  to  you,  not  out  of  any  fear 
I  had  of  my  life,  nor  yet  doubting  of  the  victory,  if 
matters  had  gone  to  the  worst;  but  I  abhor  the  shed- 
ding of  Christian  blood,  especially  of  those  that  are 
my  own  subjects;  and  therefore  I  yield  to  you,  and 
will  be  ruled  hereafter  by  your  counsels,  trusting  you 
will  respect  me  as  your  born  princess  and  Queen." 

The  utterance  of  attachment  to  her,  the  condemna- 
tion of  Bothwell,  and  insults  of  the  common  soldiery, 
were  the  commingling  voices  that  fell  upon  her  ear. 
But  it  was  soon  apparent  that  professions  of  obedi- 
ence were  like  "  the  morning  cloud  and  early  dew." 

'•  The  march  commenced;  from  the  Queen's  man- 
ner, it  was  supposed  she  anticipated  a  rescue,  and  in 
reality  a  party  composed  of  the  Hamiltons  had  ad- 
vanced for  that  purpose,  but  she  was  soon  convinced 
her  expectations  were  hojx-less.  When  she  approached 
the  capital,  a  new  trial  awaited  her,  and  she  beheld 
the  multitude  poured  forth,  not  to  relieve  or  even 
to  commiserate  her  distresses!,  but  to  display  before 
her  eyes  a  bloody  ensign,  on  which  was  represented 
the  young  prince,  kneeling  and  invoking  vengeance  on 
the  authors  of  his  father's  murder.  At  this  fright- 
ful image,  Mary  almost  fell  from  her  horse,  and, 
bursting  into  an  agony  of  tears,  exclaimed, — '  I  am 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  197 

your  native  princess!  descended  from  the  blood  of 
Bruce !  Treat  me  not  thus !  "  Her  appeal  was  unre- 
garded. Even  in  the  women, — her  disheveled  hair, 
her  tears,  her  anguish,  awakened  no  pity;  and  she 
proceeded,  amidst  loud  execrations,  till  she  reached 
the  provost's  house,  where  she  was  lodged  for  that 
night." 

The  hours  of  darkness  were  devoted  to  lamenta- 
tions— cries  for  help — and  piteous  expressions  of  de- 
spair. In  the  morning,  the  barbarous  soldiery  waved 
before  her  window  the  tragic  flag;  when  Mary  raved 
like  a  lunatic,  and  with  disheveled  and  neglected  ap- 
parel, begged  in  the  name  of  God  for  deliverance. 
The  lords  partially  calmed  her  excitement  with  in- 
timations of  restoration  to  Holyrood  and  liberty. 
But  her  unalterable  devotion  to  Bothwell,  displayed 
in  conversation  and  communications,  affirmed  to  have 
been  sent  to  him  at  Dunbar,  through  a  bribed  mes- 
senger, decided  her  captors  to  run  no  farther  hazard 
of  war,  and  their  own  remorseless  execution.  At 
eight  o'clock  in  the  evening,  ]\fary  was  removed  to 
Holyrood  Palace,  escorted  by  three  hundred  hack- 
butters.  The  lords  then  sat  in  council,  and  made  out 
the  order  for  her  imprisonment.  They  set  forth  the 
necessity  of  taking  arms;  her  surrender;  and  Both- 
well's  flight ;  adding,  "  after  they  had  opened  and  de- 
clared unto  her  highness  her  own  estate  and  condi- 
tion, and  the  miserable  estate  of  their  realm,  with 
the  danger  that  her  dearest  sou,  the  prince,  stood  in, 
requiring  that  she  would  suffer  and  command  the 
said  murder  and  authors  thereof  to  be  punished,  they 
found  in  her  majesty  s,uch  untowardness  and  repug- 
nance thereto,  that  rather  she  appeared  to  fortify  and

maintain  the  said  Earl  Bothwell  and  bis  accomplices 
in  the  said  wicked  crime.-,  n&lt;»r  to  suffer  justice  to  pus 
forward ;  whereby,  if  her  highness  should  be  left  in 
that  state,  to  follow  her  own  inordinate  passion,  it 
would  not  fail  to  succeed  to  the  final  confusion  and 
extermination  of  the  whole  realm.  So  that,  after 
mature  consultation,  by  common  advice,  it  is  thought 
convenient,  concluded  and  decreed,  that  her  majesty's 
person  be  sequestered  from  all  society  of  the  said  Earl 
Bothwell,  and  from  all  having  of  intelligence  with 
him  or  any  others,  whereby  he  may  have  any  comfort 
to  escape  due  punishment  for  his  demerits.  And 
finding  no  place  more  meet  or  commodious  for  her 
majesty  to  remain  in  than  the  house  and  place  of 
Lochleven,  ordains,  commands,  and  charges  Patrick 
Lord  Lindsay  of  the  Byres,  William  Lord  Ruthven, 
and  William  Douglas  of  Lochleven,  to  pass  and  con- 
voy her  majesty  to  the  said  place  of  Lochleven,  and 
the  said  lords  to  receive  her  therein,  and  there  they 
are  every  one  of  them  to  keep  her  majesty  surely, 
within  the  said  place,  and  in  nowise  to  suffer  her  to 
pass  forth  of  the  same,  or  to  have  intelligence  from 
any  manner  of  persons,  or  yet  to  send  advertisements 
or  directions  for  intelligence  with  any  living  persons, 
except  in  their  own  presence  and  audience,  or  by  the 
commandments  and  directions  of  the  lords  under  sub- 
scribing, or  part  of  them  representing  the  council  at 
Edinburgh,  or  otherwise  where  they  shall  resort  for 
;hc  time,  as  they  will  answer  to  God,  and  upon  their 
duty,  to  the  commonweal  of  this  country,  keeping 
these  presents  for  their  warrant !  " 

In  the  night  of  June  10th,  Mary,  without  a  ret- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  199 

inue,  "  mounted  on  a  sorry  hackney,"  attired  in 
coarse  cassock,  and  guarded  by  the  savage  Ruthven 
and  Lindsay,  entered  Lochleven  Castle.  This  for- 
tress lies  north  of  Edinburgh,  on  a  small  island  in  the 
middle  of  the  lake.  The  buildings  covered  nearly 
half  of  the  land,  and  on  three  sides  the  waters  laved 
the  naked  walls.  The  remaining  side  had  a  garden  to 
relieve  the  view.  The  deep  basement  was  a  dungeon 
for  solitary  imprisonment.  The  only  entrance  to  the 
square  tower,  which  was  the  family  residence,  was 
through  a  window  in  the  second  story,  by  a  ladder, 
raised  and  lowered  with  a  chain.  Mary  was  confined 
in  an  octagonal  tower  at  one  corner  of  the  massive 
pile.  The  distance  to  the  shore  was  half  a  mile.  The 
castle  was  owned  by  William  Douglas,  half  brother 
of  Murray,  whose  mother,  Margaret  Erskine,  for- 
merly mistress  of  James  V.,  Mary  Stuart's  father, 
was  the  Queen's  mortal  enemy.  She  was  the  wreck 
of  a  beauty,  and  proud  as  a  Roman  in  her  old  age, 
boasting  that  her  son,  born  of  King  James,  was  law- 
ful heir  to  the  throne  of  Scotland.  She  also  embraced 
the  extreme  view  of  the  Puritans,  and  became  an  in- 
tolerant partizan.  To  her  tender  mercies  Mary  was 
committed.  The  captivity  of  a  sovereign  to  her  sub- 
jects was  a  novel  and  startling  event.  While  Europe 
had  been  the  arena  of  revolutionary  conflicts,  till 
these  games  of  oppressive,  unprincipled  monarchs, 
and  the  outraged  masses,  were  familiar  horrors,  this 
sacrilegious  invasion  of  the  royal  prerogative  was  an 
alarming  precedent.  But  such  was  the  loss  of  popu- 
lar interest  in  Mary  at  home,  that  the  timorous 
friends  of  the  Queen  were  quite  indifferent  to  her 
fate.  Philip  of  Spain  was  busy  with  a  revolt  in 


200  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

Netherlands ;  and  Elizabeth  only,  to  the  surrounding 
monarch*,  gave  token  of  decided  solicitude  in  the 
issue  of  the  daring  arrest.  She  was  indignant  at  the 
lawlessness  of  the  rebels  in  the  confinement  of  Mary's 
person ;  yet  she  feared  the  captive  as  a  rival.  And 
while  she  sent  a  letter  of  condolence  to  the  prisoner 
of  Lochleven,  another  conveyed  her  sympathy  and 
offers  of  support  to  the  insurgents.  Poor  Mary! 
Deserted  and  environed  with  gloomy  walls  that  were 
washed  with  lonely  waters;  watched  by  Elizabeth, 
whose  imperious  gaze  was  always  resting  on  the  as- 
piring daughter  of  Stuart ;  and,  worse  than  a  widow 
—what  hours  of  reflection  were  hers!  But  ambition 
ruled  the  woman,  and  she  was  unchastened  with  the 
satire  which  the  tragical  romance  of  her  fate  made 
upon  human  greatness. 


CHAPTER  VI. 

ON  the  20th  of  June,  Mary's  peril  was  greatly  in- 
creased by  circumstances  which  are  related  by  Mig- 
net :  "  George  Dalgleish,  Bothwell's  chamberlain,  had 
been  arrested  with  a  casket  which  he  was,  doubtless, 
conveying  to  Dunbar,  and  which  contained  some  pri- 
vate papers  that  furnished  decided  proofs  of  Mary's 
guilt.  This  casket  was  made  of  silver,  overgilt  with 
gold,  and  surmounted  with  the  cypher  of  Francis  II., 
who  had  given  it  to  Mary.  Mary,  in  her  turn,  had 
given  it  to  Bothwell,  who  had  inclosed  in  it  some  let- 
ters which  she  had  written  to  him  in  her  own  hand- 
writing, both  before  and  after  the  murder  of  the 
King,  some  sonnets  breathing  the  most  passionate  af- 
fection for  him,  and  a  contract  of  marriage  which 
she  had  signed  some  time  before  the  premeditated  sur- 
prise at  Almond  Bridge.*  Bothwell  had,  doubtless, 

*  "  Ane  silver-box  owergilt  with  gold,  with  all  missive  let- 
teris,  contractis  or  obligationis,  for  marriage-sonetis  or  luif- 
balletis,  and  all  utheris  letteris  contenit  thairin,  send  and  past 
betwixt  the  Quene,  our  said  Soverane  Lordis  moder,  and 
James,  sumtyme  Erie  Bothuile,  quhilk  box  and  haill  pieces 
within  the  samyn  were  takin  and  fund  with  umquhill  George 
Dangleisch,  servand  to  the  Erie  Bothuile,  upon  the  xx  day  of 
June,  the  zeir  of  God,  1567  zeiris."  Discharge  to  my  Lord 
Morton,  given  on  the  16th  of  September,  1568,  by  Murray  to 
Morton,  (who,  ever  since  the  22d  of  June,  1567,  had  kept  pos-

preserved  these  papers  as  guarantees  against  the  pos- 
sible inconstancy  of  the  Queen.  He  had  left  the  cas- 
ket in  Edinburgh  Castle,  under  the  care  of  two  of  his 
accomplices,  George  Dalgleish  and  James  Balfour. 
Either  by  chance,  or  by  the  perfidy  of  the  odious  Bal- 
four,* who,  like  many  others,  had  joined  the  con- 
federacy under  the  pretext  of  punishing  a  crime  to 
which  he  had  been  a  party,  Dalgleish  had  been  seized, 
and  the  papers  secured.  Powrie,  Bothwell's  porter, 
met  the  same  fate.  When  examined  before  a  court  of 
justice  on  the  23d  and  26th  of  June,  they  had  both 
confessed  how  the  plot  against  the  King's  life  had 
been  contrived  and  executed.  The  depositions  of 
these  two  servants  of  Both  well  had  furnished  a  surer 
basis  for  the  prosecution  of  that  great  criminal ;  and 
the  lords  of  the  secret  council  commanded  that  he 
should  be  seized  in  his  Castle  of  Dunbar,  and  con- 
ducted to  Edinburgh,  to  be  punished  as  the  murderer 
of  the  King.  But  whilst  the  confessions  of  Powrie 
and  Dalgleish  placed  Bothwell's  culpability  beyonji 

session  of  the  silver  box,)  in  presence  of  Lord  Lindsay,  the 
Bishop  of  Orkney,  the  Commendator  of  Dunfermline,  the 
Commendator  of  Salmerinoch,  Mr.  Secretary  Lethington,  the 
Justice  Clerk,  and  Master  Henry  Balnaves.  See  Keith,  Ap- 
pendix, p.  140.  In  a  letter  from  Throckmorton  to  Queen 
Elizabeth,  dated  Edinburgh,  25th  July,  1567,  allusion  is  made 
to  the  discovery  of  these  papers  in  the  following  terms : 
"They  mean  to  charge  her  with  the  murder  of  her  husband, 
whereof  they  say  they  have  as  apparent  proof  against  her  as 
may  be,  as  well  by  testimony  of  her  oirn  handwriting,  ichich 
they  have  recovered,  as  also  by  sufficient  witnesses."  (See 
Keith,  p.  426.) 

*  "  Bothwell  sent  a  servant  to  Sir  James  Balfour  to  save  a 
little  silver  cabinet  which  the  Queen  had  given  him.  Sir 
James  Balfour  delivers  the  cabinet  to  the  messenger,  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  203 

doubt,  the  papers  found  in  the  silver  casket  furnished 
terrible  weapons  against  the  Queen  to  those  who 
wished  to  accuse  and  destroy  her."  * 

under-hand,  giveth  advice  of  it  to  the  lords.  In  this  cabinet 
had  Bothwell  kept  the  letters  of  privacy  he  had  from  the 
Queen  ;  thus  he  kept  her  letters  to  be  an  awe-bond  upon  her, 
in  case  her  affections  should  change.  By  the  taking  of  this 
cabinet,  many  particulars  betwixt  the  Queen  and  Bothwell 
were  clearly  discovered.  These  letters  were  after  printed ; 
they  were  in  French,  with  some  sonnets  of  her  own  making.' 
(KNOX's  History  of  the  Reformation,  vol.  ii.,  p.  562.) 

*  The  annexed  note  gives  a  strong  and  interesting  denial  of 
the  genuineness  of  the  letters  in  the  casket : 

"  It  is,  forsooth,  a  boxe  of  letters  taken  from  one  Daighleysh, 
who  was  executed  for  the  Lorde  Darnley's  death,  the  Earles 
man,  for  sooth  ;  whiche  letters  he  received  at  Edenborough 
of  one  Sir  James  Balfoure,  to  convey  to  his  master  ;  Thus  say 
they,  but  we  say  to  you,  as  is  sayd  in  Terrence,  Non  sunt  haec 
satis  divisa  temporibus.  The  very  time,  if  nothing  else  were, 
bewraieth  you,  and  your  whole  cause  withal.  Is  it  to  be 
thought,  that  either  the  Earle  would  send  to  the  said  Sir 
James,  who  had  before  assisted  the  faction  against  the  Quene 
with  the  force  and  strength  of  Edenborough  Castle,  and  driven 
from  thence  the  very  Earle  himselfe,  or  that  the  said  Sir 
James  would  send  any  such  thing  to  the  Earle  ?  is  it  likely  ? 
is  it  credible  ?  Had  the  forger  and  inventour  of  this  tale,  by 
seemely  conveyance  parted  and  divided  the  distinction  of  his 
times  ?  How  say  ye  ?  Whereas  nowe  it  is  in  no  case  to  be 
supposed  or  conjectured  that  such  a  wise  vertuous  ladie  would 
sende  any  such  letters  ;  yet  putting  the  case,  that  she  had 
sent  them,  it  is  not  to  be  thought,  that  either  the  receaver 
thereof,  or  that  she  herselfe,  whom  ye  conceave  to  have  sent 
them,  would  have  suffered  them,  for  the  hasarding  of  her 
estimation  and  honour,  to  remaine  undefaced,  namely,  seeing 
there  was  a  special  mention  made,  and  warning  given  forth- 
with to  burn  them."  (LESLEY'S  Defence  of  Queen  Mary's 
Honour1:  ANDERSON'S  Collections,  vol.  i.) 


204  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

At  this  exciting  juncture,  Melvil  arrived,  and  saw 
Mary,  in  the  presence  of  Lindsay  and  Ruthven,  who 
complained  in  her  unshaken  confidence  toward  her 
tried  servant,  that  they  were  not  allowed  a  private 
interview.  Melvil  was  not  a  treacherous  man,  but  his 
sympathies  for  distracted  Scotland  evidently  led  him 
to  the  standard  of  revolt ;  he  expected  no  deliverance 
from  thickening  distress,  under  the  reign  of  the 
Queen.  Soon  after  this  mission,  Elizabeth  dis- 
patched Throckmorton,  to  confer  with  the  nobles  in 
regard  to  Mary's  liberation  and  conditional  restora- 
tion to  her  throne.  The  situation  of  the  Queen  of 
England  was  exceedingly  delicate  and  difficult. 
Mary  had  asserted  her  right  to  the  sceptre  of  Britain, 
and  there  were  princes  reidy  to  sustain  the  claim, 
when  the  opportunity  appeared.  France  and  Spain 
were  waiting  to  snatch  the  favorable  turn  to  civil 
commotion,  to  advance  the  cause  of  papal  Rome. 

To  dispose  of  the  royal  captive  was  not  an  easy 
act  of  sovereign  interposition.  If  restored  to  the 
realm  in  rebellion,  an  invincible  army  must  be  her 
train ;  if  permitted  to  revisit  France,  it  would  give 
the  Catholic  cause  a  mighty  advantage.  The  gifted  " 
and  determined  prisoner  was  no  imaginary  rival. 
And  yet  Elizabeth  was  so  thoroughly  a  monarchist, 
that  she  hated  insurrection,  even  by  an  abused  and 
oppressed  people.  Her  proposals,  in  the  conflicting 
appeals  to  her  power,  were,  after  rebuking  the  Queen 
for  her  marriage  of  Bothwell,  and  the  nobles  for  dis- 
loyalty: that  Mary  be  divorced,  and  enthroned;  that 
the  abandoned  duke  and  his  associates  be  punishr-l: 
t(  that  the  Pasties  of  Dunbar  and  Dumbarton  should 
be  entrusted  to  tlio  keeping  of  those  nobles  who  were 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  205 

hostile  to  Bothwell ;  that  a  Parliament  should  be  as- 
sembled, which  should  appoint  the  wardens  of  the 
marches,  and  the  governors  of  Edinburgh,  Stirling, 
Inchkeith,  and  the  other  strongholds  of  the  king- 
dom; that  a  great  council  should  be  established,  at 
which  five  or  six  of  its  members  should  always  be 
present,  without  whose  advice  and  consent  the  Queen 
should  be  unable  to  pass  any  act  or  make  any  ap- 
pointment; and,  finally,  that  a  general  amnesty 
should  be  proclaimed." 

Lethington,  Melvil  and  Lord  Hume,  instead  of  ac- 
ceding to  the  views  of  Elizabeth,  emphatically  ac- 
cused her  of  political  indecision,  and  a  vacillating 
policy,  which  would  soon  be  the  ruin  of  the  kingdom, 
if  Mary  were  invested  with  authority.  John  Knox, 
who  had  returned,  upon  learning  of  the  Queen's  im- 
prisonment, pledged  to  the  dominant  party  the  entire 
support  of  the  Presbyterians,  if  they  would  ratify  the 
statutes  of  1560,  which  Mary  had  refused  to  sanction. 
The  offer  was  accepted,  and  the  last  remnant  of  Po- 
pery was  doomed,  by  the  new  order  of  things,  to  ex- 
tinction; and  the  Protestant  faith  was  made  the  re- 
ligion of  all  the  universities  and  public  schools.  The 
young  prince  was  to  have  a  Puritan  education ;  and, 
"  to  maintain  the  true  religion  now  professed  in  the 
kirk  of  Scotland,  and  suppress  all  things  contrary 
to  it,"  was  added  to  the  coronation  oath.  The  Re- 
formers advocated  the  moral  equality  of  Christians, 
and  denied  the  inviolability  of  kings;  and  referred 
for  precept  and  examples  to  the  Bible.  Knox  openly 
denounced  the  Queen,  and  Buchanan  affirmed  that 
insubordination  was  the  right  of  the  people,  when  the 
crimes  of  the  sovereign  furnished  the  occasion.  These 


•j, »;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

opinions,  maintained  by  men  of  intellect  and  severe 
morality,  and  sharpened  with  conscientious  hostility 
to  the  Catholic  dogmas,  penetrated  the  common  mind, 
and  carried  their  less  thoughtful  advocates  into  the 
extremes  of  cruel  fanaticism.  The  church  presented 
a  formal  request  that  the  late  King's  death  might  be 
avenged,  "  according  to  the  laws  of  God,  according 
to  the  practices  of  their  own  realm,  and  according  to 
the  laws  which  they  call  jus  gentium,  without  respect 
of  any  person."  Some  of  the  lords  dissented  from 
the  summary  view,  and  demanded  only  Mary's  di- 
vorce from  Bothwell,  and  her  return  to  the  regal  pal- 
ace. Others  wished  to  restore  her  to  liberty,  and  re- 
quiring her  abdication  in  favor  of  James,  compel 
her  to  retire  to  France.  While  a  third  faction  loudly 
urged  that  the  Queen  should  be  tried  for  murder,  de- 
throned publicly,  and  confined  in  perpetual  captivity. 
July  8th  and  15th,  Melvil  visited  Mary  in  prison, 
to  negotiate,  if  possible,  a  divorce.  But  she  was  deaf 
to  his  importunity,  and  assured  him  that  she  would 
sooner  sacrifice  her  throne  than  Bothwell.  It  was  a 
fatal  infatuation,  that  rendered  Mary  Stuart,  amid 
all  her  augmenting  dangers,  and  the  counsel  of  Eng- 
land, France,  and  private  advisers,  unapproachable 
on  the  subject  of  abandoning  Bothwell,  who  had  al- 
ready brought  her  to  the  dizzy  margin  of  hopeless 
overthrow. 

"  The  Queen's  obstinate  determination  not  to  de- 
sert Bothwell  alarmed  and  irritated  the  lords  of  the 
secret  council.  They  resolved  to  preclude  the  possi- 
bility of  her  doing  them  any  future  injury,  by  depos- 
ing her.  This  deposition  was  prepared  under  the 
form  of  a  voluntary  abdication,  which  would  deprive 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  207 

her  of  power  without  degrading  her.  Three  acts  were 
accordingly  drawn  up  for  Mary  Stuart's  signature. 
By  the  first,  she  renounced  the  government  of  the 
kingdom,  declaring  it  was  a  burden  of  which  she  was 
weary,  and  which  she  no  longer  had  strength  or  will 
to  bear ;  and  authorized  the  immediate  coronation  of 
her  son.  The  second  and  third  conferred  .the  re- 
gency on  the  Earl  of  Murray,  during  the  minority  of 
the  young  King ;  and  appointed  the  Duke  of  Chatel- 
lerault,  with  the  Earls  of  Lennox,  Argyle,  Morton, 
Athol,  Glencairn,  and  Mar,  regents  of  the  kingdom 
till  the  return  of  Murray  from  France,  with  power  to 
continue  in  that  high  office,  if  he  refused  it.  In  case 
Mary  Stuart  should  refuse  to  sign  these  acts,  the  as- 
sembled lords  had  determined  to  prosecute  and  con- 
demn her  for  these  three  crimes — '  First,  for  breach 
and  violation  of  their  laws ;  secondly,  for  inconti- 
nency  as  well  with  the  Earl  Bothwell,  as  with  others ; 
and  thirdly,  for  the  murder  of  her  husband,  whereof, 
they  say,  they  have  as  apparent  proof  against  her  as 
may  be,  as  well  by  the  testimony  of  her  ow7n  hand- 
writing, as  also  by  sufficient  witnesses.' 

"  On  the  morning  of  the  25th  of  July,  the  fero- 
cious Lindsay,  and  the  insinuating  Melvil,  left  Edin- 
burgh on  their  way  to  Lochleven.*  One  was  the 
bearer  of  the  three  acts  which  were  to  strip  her  of 
her  authority;  the  other  wras  directed  to  warn  the 
Queen  of  the  dangers  to  which  she  would  expose  her- 
self by  refusing  to  sign  them.  Melvil  saw  her  first, 

*  Lochleven  is  a  small  lake  in  the  county  of  Kinross,  about 
twenty  miles  northwest  of  Edinburgh.  The  castle  in  which 
Mary  was  confined  is  on  a  small  island  near  the  town  of 
Kinross.

and  told  her  all.  That  :i  public  trial  would  be  sub- 
stituted for  an  abdication,  that  the  hostility  of  the 
lords  towards  her  would  Ix-come  implacable,  that  her 
defamation  would  IK-  certain  and  the  loss  of  her  crown 
inevitable,  and  that  her  life  would  probably  be  en- 
dangered, wen-  some  &lt;&gt;{  the  consequences  which  Mel- 
vil  assured  .Mary  Stuart  would  result  from  refusal; 
whilst  he  did  not  fail  to  insinuate  on  the  other  hand, 
that  any  deed  signed  in  captivity  and  under  fear 
of  death  would  be  invalid." 

Mary  was  unyielding,  though  agitated  with  eon- 
llieting  emotions  of  hope  and  despondency,  when 
the  stern  Lindsay  entered,  with  the  acts  of  the  secret 
••ouncil.  The  terror  of  his  presence  decided  the  hes- 
itafing  Queen.  Her  eyes  were  suffused  with  tears, 
and,  with  a  tremulous  hand,  she  signed  the  papers. 
Lindsay  then  demanded  from  Thomas  Sinclair  the 
privy  seal,  and  the  work  was  finished.  On  the  20th 
of  July,  the  nobles  gathered  at  Stirling  to  crown  the 
prince  royal.  The  Hamiltons,  who  were  a  strong 
faction,  opposed  the  coronation,  and  had  resolved  to 
deliver  the  Queen.  Throckmorton,  Elizabeth's  am- 
bassador, refrained  from  the  shadow  of  approval,  and 
admonished  the  lords  to  take  no  rash  measures.  He 
awaited  his  sovereign's  instructions,  and  soon  received 
them,  in  a  strain  of  withering  Indignation  against 
the  insurgents.  After  repudiating  with  scorn  the 
right  to  be  judges  of  their  ruler,  she  continued : 

''  What  warrant  have  they  in  Scripture,  being  sub-^ 
jects,  to  depose  their  prince;  but  contrary,  and  that 
with  express  words  in  St.  Paul,  who,  to  the  Romans,* 

*  Mary  seems  to  have  had  in  mind  Romans  xiii  :  1.     '•  Let 
every  soul  be  subject  unto  the  higher  powers."    But  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  209 

commanded  them  to  obey  potestatibus  supereminenti- 
oribus  gladium  gestantibus,  although  it  is  well  known 
that  rulers  in  Home  were  then  infidels  ?  Or  what 
law  find  they  written  in  any  Christian  monarchy,  how 
and  what  sort  subjects  shall  take  and  arrest  the  per- 
son of  their  princes,  commit  and  detain  them  in  cap- 
tivity, proceed  against  them  by  process  and  judgment, 
as  we  are  well  assured  no  such  order  is  to  be  found 
in  the  whole  civil  law  ?  And  if  they  have  no  warrant 
by  Scripture  or  law,  and  yet  can  find  out  for  their 
purpose  some  examples,  as  we  hear  by  seditious  bal- 
lads they  put  in  print,  they  would  pretend ;  we  must 
justly  account  those  examples  to  be  unlawful,  and 
acts  of  rebellion:  and  so,  if  the  stories  be  well 
weighed,  the  success  will  prove  them.  You  shall  say 
that  this  may  suffice  to  such  as  do  pretend  to  be  car- 
ried in  their  actions  by  authority  either  of  religion 
or  of  justice.  And  as  to  others  that  for  particular 
respect  look  only  to  their  own  surety,  it  were  well 
done,  before  they  proceeded  any  further,  if  they  did 
well  consider  how  to  stay  where  they  be,  and  to  devise 
how  to  make  surety  of  their  doings  already  past,  than 
to  increase  their  peril  by  more  dangerous  doings  to 
follow.  We  detest  and  abhor  the  murder  committed 
upon  our  cousin  their  King,  and  mislike  as  much  as 
any  of  them  the  marriage  of  the  Queen  our  sister  with 
Bothwell.  But  herein  we  dissent  from  them,  that  we 
think  it  not  lawful  nor  tolerable  for  them,  being  by 
God's  ordinance  subjects,  to  call  her,  who  also  by 
God's  ordinance  is  their  superior  and  prince,  to  an- 
swer to  their  accusations  by  way  of  force ;  for  we  do

in  that  verse.

not  think  it  constant  in  nature  the  head  should  be 
subject  to  the  foot. 

"  If  they  shall  determine  anything  to  the  depriva- 
tion of  the  Queen,  their  sovereign  lady,  of  her  royal 
estate,  we  are  well  assured  of  our  own  determination, 
and  we  have  some  just  and  probable  cause  to  think 
the  like  of  other  princes  of  Christendom,  that  we  will 
make  ourselves  a  plain  party  against  them,  to  the  re- 
venging of  their  sovereign,  and  for  example  to  all  pos- 
terity." 

July  29th,  the  infant  James,  then  thirteen  months 
old,  was  crowned  at  Stirling,  and  John  Knox 
preached  the  sermon  of  the  grand  occasion.  The  Re- 
former seldom  enjoyed  a  prouder  triumph,  than 
standing  in  the  hall  of  Mary's  stronghold,  and  pro- 
claiming his  Protestant  views.  The  ceremonies  were 
followed  by  bonfires,  and  all  the  popular  demonstra- 
tions of  gladness,  on  highland  and  in  lowland,  the 
King  could  have  claimed,  had  he  been  sufficiently 
mature  to  comprehend  the  pageantry  about  him. 
That  coronation  was  one  of  a  series  of  suggestive 
events. 

At  Stirling  Castle,  Mary  Stuart  was  crowned  in 
the  arms  of  her  nurse;  there  a  son  was  born'  and 
baptized ;  and  while  the  captive  mother  was  lament- 
ing "  the  evil  times,"  in  prison,  the  wondering  boy 
was  the  centre  of  enthusfasm.  In  the  same  renowned 
pile  his  rights  were  the  theme  of  rejoicing,  and  her 
solitude  was  the  subject  of  heartless  approval. 

Murray  had  heard  in  France  of  Mary's  errors  and 
calamities,  and  cherishing  a  tenderness  and  attach- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  211 

merit  toward  his  sister,  set  out,  upon  receiving  intel- 
ligence of  the  coronation,  for  Scotland.  Before  he 
reached  England,  his  hostility  to  the  Queen's  impris- 
onment was  modified.  A  messenger,  whom  he  had  dis- 
patched to  Scotland,  met  him  with  the  declaration 
of  the  nobles,  and  the  disclosures  of  the  silver  casket. 
When  he  entered  the  presence  of  Elizabeth,  he  was 
less  ardent  in  Mary's  cause  than  when  in  France. 
But  the  indignant  Queen  reiterated  her  denunciations 
of  the  lords,  and  her  purpose  to  restore  Mary  Stuart 
to  the  throne.  This  increased  Murray's  alienation, 
and  also  the  danger  of  the  royal  prisoner.  The  Ham- 
iltons  had  become  traitors,  and  aspiring  to  the  sov- 
ereignty, were  negotiating  for  the  trial  and  execution 
of  Mary.  The  advent  of  Murray  at  such  a  time  was 
an  exciting  incident.  The  different  factions  sent  rep- 
resentatives across  the  frontier  to  enlist  his  sympa- 
thy. He  respectfully  heard  their  appeals,  but  gave  no 
pledges  for  the  future.  Then  he  crossed  the  boun- 
dary of  the  kingdoms,  an  escort  of  three  hundred  men 
attending  him  to  Edinburgh.  All  eyes  were  turned 
to  him,  as  the  regent  of  distracted  Scotland. 

He  refused  to  decide,  amid  the  conflicting  views  of 
the  people,  until  he  had  seen  and  conversed  with 
Mary.  The  nobles  did  not  oppose  the  visit,  because 
they  had  no  power  to  prevent  it ;  and  on  the  15th  of 
August,  Murray,  in  company  with  Morton,  Athol  and 
Lindsay,  repaired  to  Lochleven  Castle.  It  was  his 
purpose  to  secure  her  appointment  of  himself  to  the 
regency,  and  enter  upon  the  government  with  the  fair- 
est prospect  of  success. 

"  On  seeing  him  enter  her  prison,  Mary  thought 
that  her  brother  had  come  to  be  her  friend  and  pro- 


L&gt;  ]  -i  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

tcrtor.  She  burst  into  a  flood  of  tears,  and  passion- 
ately complained  of  the  unjust  treatment  she  had 
&lt;'\|K&gt;rienced.  Murray  listened  to  her  in  silence,  and 
neither  commiserated  nor  consoled  her.  The  suppli- 
ant Mary  then  said,  turning  towards  Athol  and  Mor- 
ton: 'My  lords,  you  have  had  experience  of  my 
severity,  and  of  the  end  of  it ;  I  pray  you  also  let  me 
find  that  you  have  learned  by  me  to  make  an  end  of 
yours,  or,  at  least,  that  you  can  make  it  final.'  But 
they  were  as  taciturn  and  gloomy  as  Murray. 
Alarmed  at  a  visit  that  seemed  to  confirm  the  sinister 
reports  which  had  been  spread  concerning  her,  Man 
took  her  brother  aside  before  supper,  anxiously  que-- 
tioned  him  as.  to  the  intentions  of  the  lords,  and  in 
vain  endeavored  to  fathom  his  own  projects;  but  for 
two  hours  Murray  continued  silent  and  impenetrable. 
When  the  bitter  meal  had  passed  away,  Mary  again 
desired  to  converse  with  her  brother,  '  and  everybody 
being  retired,  they  conferred  together  until  one  of 
the  clock  after  midnight.'  In  this  second  interview, 
Murray  threw  off  his  premeditated  reserve,  and  spoke 
to  the  Queen  with  terrible  frankness  ami  inexorable 
severity.  He  told  her  what  he  thought  of  herself  and 
her  misgovernment,  pitilessly  reminded  her  of  her 
improprieties  of  conduct,  and  laid  before  her,  one  by 
one,  all  the  actions,  which,  he  said,  had  violated  her 
conscience,  sullied  her  honor,  and  compromised  her 
safety.  The-  unhappy  Queen  was  plunged  into  de- 
spair by  this  terrible  accusation,  and  she  lost  all 
courage.  '  Sometimes,'  says  Throckmorton,  in  his 
narrative  of  this  painful  scene,  '  she  wept  bitterly; 
sometimes  she  acknowledged  her  unadvisedness  and 
misgovernment;  some  tiling  she  &lt;1M  confess  plainly; 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  21 3 

some  things  she  did  excuse ;  some  things  she  did  ex- 
tenuate.' After  having  crushed  her  with  the  weight 
of  these  dreadful  recollections,  Murray  left  his  sister 
iu  an  agony  of  fear;  she  thought  that  her  fate  was 
sealed,  and  that  she  must  expect  nothing  but  from 
God's  mercy.  In  this  state  of  mind  she  passed  the  re- 
mainder of  the  night. 

"  The  next  morning  she  sent  for  her  brother,  and 
Murray  once  more  entered  her  room.  Perceiving  the 
impression  he  had  made,  he  assumed  a  milder  mood, 
changed  his  tone,  threw  in  some  words  of  consolation, 
and  assured  her  that  he  desired  to  save  her  life,  and, 
if  possible,  to  preserve  her  honor.  '  But,'  he  added, 
'  it  is  not  in  my  power,  only ;  the  lords  and  others 
have  interest  in  the  matter.  Notwithstanding,  mad- 
am, I  will  declare  to  you  which  be  the  occasions 
that  niay  put  you  in  jeopardy.  For  your  peril,  these 
be  they:  your  own  practices  to  disturb  the  quiet  of 
your  realm  and  the  reign  of  your  son ;  to  enterprise 
to  escape  from  where  you  are,  to  put  yourself  at  lib- 
erty ;  to  animate  any  of  your  subjects  to  troubles  or 
disobedience;  the  Queen  of  England  or  the  French 
King  to  molest  this  realm,  either  with  their  war,  or 
with  war  intestine,  by  your  procurement  or  other- 
wise ;  and  your  own  persisting  in  this  inordinate  af- 
fection with  the  Earl  Bothwell.' 

"  At  these  words,  Mary,  who  had  remained  under 
the  dreadful  impressions  of  the  previous  night,  dis- 
cerned a  gleam  of  hope.  She  threw  herself  into  her 
brother's  arms,  and  expressed  her  satisfaction  at  his 
assurance  that  he  would  protect  her  life,  and  the 
hopes  he  allowed  her  to  entertain  that  her  honor 
would  be  saved.  In  order  to  arrive  more  surely  at 


214  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

this  desired  result,  she  conjured  him  not  to  refuse 
the  regency,  *  for  by  this  means,'  she  said,  *  my  son 
shall  be  preserved,  my  realm  well  governed,  and  I  in 
safety/  Murray  hesitated,  and  alleged  reasons,  the 
sincerity  of  which  we  cannot  suspect,  against  under- 
taking so  arduous  a  task.  Always  hurried  away  by 
irresistible  impulses,  Mary  only  entreated  him  the 
more  urgently  to  sacrifice  his  own  repugnance  to  the 
welfare  of  his  sister.  She  suggested  that  he  should 
make  himself  master  of  all  the  forts  in  the  kingdom, 
requested  him  to  take  her  jewels  and  other  valuables 
into  his  custody,  and  offered  to  give  to  his  regency  the 
support  of  her  letters  and  the  authority  of  her  name. 
Murray  at  length  assented,  appearing  to  accept  with 
resignation  what  he  doubtless  most  ardently  coveted. 
Before  leaving  his  sister,  he  enjoined  the  Lords  Lind- 
say, Ruthven,  and  Lochleven,  '  to  treat  the  Queen 
with  gentleness,  with  liberty,  and  with  all  other  good 
usage.'  He  then  bade  her  farewell,  '  and  then  began 
another  fit  of  weeping,  which  being  appeased,  she  em- 
braced him  very  lovingly,  kissed  him,  and  sent  her 
blessing  unto  the  prince,  her  son,  by  him.' 

"  On  this,  as  on  many  other  occasions,  Mary  Stuart 
yielded  to  one  of  those  rapid,  momentary  impressions 
which  so  frequently  guided  her  conduct,  and  set  at 
nought  the  dictates  of  prudence.  At  Lochleven,  she 
displayed  the  same  character  as  at  the  Kirk  of  Field, 
Almond  Bridge,  Carberry  Hill,  and  shortly  after- 
wards at  Carlisle,  always  yielding  to  invincible  pas- 
sions or  deceptive  opinions.  After  having  been  ter- 
rified into  signing  her  coed  of  abdication,  she  had 
been  surprised  into  giving  her  consent  to  it.  This 
consent,  which  s-hc  ere  long  repented,  had  been  ob- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  215 

tained  from  her  by  the  cold  and  astute  Murray, 
whilst  her  troubled  heart  was  passing  from  intense 
alarm  to  buoyant  hope. 

"  Assured  of  her  important  approbation,  Murray 
proceeded  to  Stirling  to  visit  the  infant  monarch,  in 
whose  name  he  was  to  govern,  and  returned  to  Edin- 
burgh on  the  19th  of  August.  Three  days  after,  he 
was  declared  regent  in  the  council  chamber  at  the 
Tolbooth.  Laying  his  hand  upon  the  Gospels,  like  a 
true  secretary  and  ardent  supporter  of  the  liberties  of 
the  realm,  he  took  the  following  oath :  '  I,  James, 
Earl  of  Murray,  Lord  Abernethy,  promise  faithfully, 
in  the  presence  of  the  Eternal,  my  God,  that  I,  during 
the  whole  course  of  my  life,  will  serve  the  same  Eter- 
nal, my  God,  to  the  uttermost  of  my  power,  accord- 
ing as  he  requires  in  his  most  holy  word,  revealed 
and  contained  in  the  New  and  Old  Testaments ;  and, 
according  to  the  same  word,  will  maintain  the  true 
religion  of  Jesus  Christ,  the  preaching  of  his  holy, 
word,  and  due  and  right  administration  of  his  sacra- 
ments, now  received  and  practiced  within  this  realm ; 
and  also  will  abolish  and  withstand  all  false  religion 
contrary  to  the  same;  and  will  rule  the  people  com- 
mitted to  my  charge  and  regiment  during  the  minor- 
ity and  less-age  of  the  King,  my  sovereign,  according 
to  the  will  and  command  of  God,  revealed  in  his 
aforesaid  word,  and  according  to  the  loveable  laws 
and  constitutions  received  in  this  realm,  noways  re- 
pugnant to  the  said  word  of  the  Eternal,  my  God; 
and  will  procure  to  my  uttermost,  to  the  kirk  of  God 
and  all  Christian  people,  true  and  perfect  peace,  in 
all  time  coming.  The  rights  and  rents,  with  all  just 
privileges  of  the  crown  of  Scotland,  I  will  preserve 


216  MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS. 

and  keep  inviolate;  neither  will  I  transfer  nor  alien- 
ate the  same.  I  will  forbid  and  repress,  in  all  estates 
and  degrees,  reif,  oppression,  and  all  kind  of  wrong. 
In  all  judgments  I  will  command  and  procure  that 
justice  and  equity  be  kept  to  all  creatures  without 
exception,  as  he  l&gt;e  merciful  to  me  and  you,  that  is 
the  Lord  and  Father  of  all  mercies;  and  out  of  this 
realm  of  Scotland,  and  empire  thereof,  I  will  be  care- 
ful to  root  that  shall  be  convicted  by  the  true  kirk  of 
God  of  the  aforesaid  crimes.  And  these  things  above 
written,  I  faithfully  affirm  by  this  my  solemn  oath/ 
The  seventy-third  psalm  was  then  sung,  and  Murray 
was  proclaimed  regent  at  the  Market  Cross,  amid  the 
acclamations  of  the  people." 

The  wheels  of  revolution  had  reached  a  plane  of 
rest.  The  extreme  and  conservative  parties  submit- 
ted without  opposition  to  this  administration.  Mur- 
ray took  the  helm  of  the  tempest-tossed  ship  of  State, 
with  a  steady  hand,  and  the  approval  of  his  subjects. 
Foreign  princes  acquiesced,  excepting  Elizabeth, 
whose  anger  was  kindled  intensely  with  repeated  fail- 
ures to  influence  the  captors  of  Mary;  but  she  was 
powerless  to  avert  the  consummation  attained,  and 
also  to  reverse  the  march  of  empire.  Lethington  as- 
sured Throckmorton,  the  English  ambassador,  that 
the  lords  were  ready  for  war,  and  rebuked  the  im- 
perious tone  of  Elizabeth.  Murray  added :  "  Though 
I  were  not  here  at  the  doings  past,  yet  surely  I  must 
allow  of  them ;  and  seeing  the  Queen  and  they  have 
laid  upon  me  the  charge  of  the  regency,  (a  burden 
which  I  would  gladly  have  eschewed,)  I  do  mean  to 
wear  my  life  in  defence  of  their  action,  and  will 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.         217 

either  reduce  all  men  to  obedience  in  the  King's 
name,  or  it  shall  cost  me  my  life." 

Murray  soon  obtained  command  of  the  fortresses 
of  the  realm,  and  was  virtually  monarch. 
;  Bothwell  had  fled  from  the  Castle  of  Dunbar  to  the 
Highlands,  where  he  held  estates.  An  armed  de- 
tachment, whose  chieftain  was  the  Laird  of  Grange, 
went  in  hot  pursuit  of  the  fugitive.  The  freebooter 
then  equipped  a  small  fleet,  and  sought  security  amid 
the  Shetland  and  Orkney  isles,  whose  frowning  cliffs 
dot  the  dark  and  tempestuous  seas  of  the  North.  The 
Laird  of  Grange  followed  in  his  wake,  seized  two  of 
his  vessels,  and  was  near  Bothwell's  ship,  when  he 
struck  a  shoal,  and  the  daring  outlaw  made  his  es- 
cape ;  striking  out  into  the  open  ocean,  he  was  driven 
by  a  wild  tempest  to  the  coast  of  Norway.  His  career 
was  commenced  as  a  pirate ;  and  falling  in  with  a 
Danish  man-of-war,  he  was  boarded  and  taken  to 
Denmark.  The  king,  Frederick  II.,  refused  to  give 
up  the  notorious  Bothwell,  either  to  Murray  or  to  the 
Queen  of  England,  but  confined  him  in  the  prison  of 
Malmoe  Castle.  After  the  torture  of  constant  fear 
of  being  delivered  up  to  his  enemies,  his  restless 
spirit,  chafing  in  restraint,  like  a  caged  lion  lashing 
the  bars  of  his  iron  lair,  he  died  a  despairing  lunatic. 
His  associates  and  minions  were  many  of  them  ar- 
rested, tried  and  executed.  Powrie,  Dalgleish,  Hay 
of  Tallo,  and  Hepburn  were  of  the  number. 

The  most  distinguished  conspirators,  however,  on 
account  of  their  position  and  influence,  received  hon- 
ors, instead  of  the  executioner's  axe.  And  it  has 
always  been  thus;  human  justice  seldom  reaches  a

brow  which  reflects  the  smile  of  mammon,  or  wears 
the  laurel  of  renown;  foreshadowing  the  necessity 
and  desirableness  of  a  final  tribunal,  where  the  evi- 
dence and  sentence  will  be  unquestioned  and  unal- 
terable. 

December,  1567,  the  Parliament  assembled  with 
unusual  completeness  in  number,  and  an  imposing 
array  of  titles.  Four  bishops,  fourteen  abbots,  twelve 
earls,  sixteen  lords  and  eldest  sons  of  lords,  and 
twenty-seven  commissioners  of  burghs  were  present. 
This  Parliament  enacted  religious  uniformity  by 
ratifying  the  Confession  of  Faith  in  1560,  and  sanc- 
tioning the  entire  abolition  of  Catholicism ;  it  re- 
sumed from  the  laymen  a  third  of  that  ecclesiastical 
property  which  they  had  seized,  and  applied  it  to  the 
support  of  ministers  and  schools  belonging  to  the  Re- 
formed church ;  it  recognized  the  legal  elevation  of 
the  young  King  to  the  throne  of  Scotland,  sanctioned 
the  appointment  of  the  regent,  and  keenly  debated  the 
course  to  be  pursued  with  regard  to  the  Queen — some 
wishing  to  bring  her  at  once  to  trial,  while  others 
desired  merely  to  retain  her  in  captivity.  The  more 
moderate  party  gained  the  victory;  but,  in  order  to 
justify  the  confederate  lords  for  having  taken  arms, 
imprisoned,  and  dethroned  their  sovereign,  the  Par- 
liament passed  an  act,  by  the  terms  of  which  Man- 
Stuart  was  seriously  criminated.  It  contains  the  fol- 
lowing clause.  *'  That  the  cause,  and  all  things  de- 
pending tlioreon,  were  in  the  Queen's  own  default,  in 
so  far  as  by  divers  her  privy  letters,  written  wholly 
with  her  own  hand,  and  sent  by  her  to  James,  some- 
time Earl  of  Bothwell,  chief  executor  of  the  said  hor-

rible  murder,  as  well  before  the  committing  thereof, 
as  thereafter;  and  by  her  ungodly  and  dishonorable 
proceeding  to  a  pretended  marriage  with  him,  sud- 
denly and  immediately  thereafter,  it  is  most  certain 
that  she  was  privy  to  it  and  part  of  the  aforenamed 
murder  of  the  King  her  lawful  husband,  committed 
by  the  said  James,  sometime  Earl  of  Bothwell,  his 
complices  and  partakers." 

This  harsh  expression  of  opinion,  tantamount  to 
a  condemnation,  rendered  Mary  Stuart's  captivity 
more  stringent,  although  by  Murray's  orders  she  was 
treated  with  respect  and  consideration.  She  was 
more  closely  watched,  lest  she  should  write  to  request 
the  assistance  of  any  foreign  power,  or  should  devise 
a  plan  for  her  escape  with  her  friends  in  Scotland. 
She  was  able  to  write  only  while  her  keepers  were  at 
their  meals  or  asleep,  for  the  daughters  of  the  castel- 
lan slept  with  her.  The  vigilance  of  Margaret  Ers- 
kine,  who  watched  her  captive  as  a  tigress  watches  the 
prey  for  her  young,  and  the  fidelity  of  keepers,  were 
in  vain.  George  Douglas,  son  of  Margaret,  was  smitten 
with  Mary's  surpassing  beauty,  and  his  sympathies 
were  awakened  by  her  calamities.  The  magic  which 
fell  upon  all  hearts  from  the  azure  eye,  and  wondrous 
fascination  of  her  graceful  person,  made  the  Douglas 
a  creature  of  her  will.  He  resolved  to  obtain  her 
liberty,  and  her  hand.  Disguising  the  prisoner  in 
the  apparel  of  a  laundress,  who  frequented  the  castle, 
he  led  her  unsuspected  to  the  margin  of  the  lake. 
The  boat  glided  away  from  the  shore,  and  Mary's 
heart  throbbed  with  the  anticipation  of  freedom. 
Friends  were  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  calm  waters, 
awaiting  the  bark.  One  of  the  oarsmen  suddenly  sus-

jH-cting  the  disguise,  approached  the  Queen  and  p!&gt; 
antly  began  to  lift  the  veil.  The  impulsive  ;in&lt;l 
startled  Mary,  extending  her  white  hand  to  prevent 
the  view  of  her  face,  revealed,  in  the  delicate  and 
snowy  signal,  the  dreaded  majesty  of  the  dethroned 
sovereign.  She  assumed  the  bolder  tone  of  author ity, 
and  commanded  the  boatmen  to  proceed.  But  they 
feared  the  Laird  of  Lochleven  more  than  the  anger 
of  a  royal  captive,  and  returned  without  delay  to  the 
castle.  Mary  entered  her  tower  in  bitter  disappoint- 
ment and  grief.  This  was  on  the  25th  of  March, 
1568.  She  wrote  to  Catherine  de  Medici,  "I  have 
with  great  difficulty  dispatched  the  bearer  of  this  to 
inform  you  of  my  misery,  and  entreat  you  to  have 
pity  upon  me."  May  1st,  she  addressed  Elizabeth  in 
similar  but  more  pathetic  and  supplicating  terms, 
and  renewed  her  appeals  to  the  court  of  France. 

George  Douglas,  the  lover,  was  not  idle.  He  had 
continued  in  the  neighborhood  of  Lochleven,  and 
mused  day  and  night  upon  plans  for  the  escape  of  the 
Queen.  He  resolved  upon  another  experiment,  May 
2d,  which  was  Sunday.  Communicating  with  Mary, 
Lord  Seton,  and  the  Ilamiltons,  through  a  page,  six- 
teen years  of  age,  called  the  "  Little  Douglas,"  he  had 
well  and  successfully  arranged  the  plot.  Seton  and 
others  were  to  receive  the  prisoner  at  the  castle  gates, 
at  the  hour  of  meals,  the  doors  of  the  fortress  were  all 
shut,  and  the  keys  laid  l»e&gt;ide  the  castellan.*  When 
the  appointed  occasion  arrived,  the  pa-re  placed  the 
plate  before  the  Laird,  and,  dropping  liis  napkin  over 
the  keys,  bore  them  unobserved  a\v:iy.  lie  hastened 
to  Mary,  who,  attired  in  a  servant's  dress,  followed

him  through  the  gate,  which  was  locked  behind  them, 
to  prevent  pursuit.  They  then  stepped  into  a  boat, 
and  removing  the  fastening,  rowed  arrow-like  across 
Lochleven.  As  the  bark  touched  the  beach,  George 
Douglas  and  Lord  Seton,  who  had  been  secreted  in  an 
adjacent  village,  met  the  smiling,  hopeful  Queen. 
Vaulting  lightly  to  the  saddle  of  her  horse,  she  dashed 
off  towards  Niddry  Castle,  in  West  Lothian,  the  seat 
of  Seton.  Resting  a  few  hours,  she  journeyed  for- 
ward to  the  strong  fortress  of  Hamilton,  and  was  met 
by  Lord  Claud  Hamilton,  with  a  company  of  fifty 
horsemen.  Upon  her  arrival,  she  was  received  with 
the  salutations  of  the  Archbishop  of  St.  Andrews. 
Mary  Stuart  now  prepared  to  assert  her  right  to  the 
throne  of  Bruce,  with  arms.  She  sent  Beaton,  brother 
of  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow,  to  France,  to  crave  as- 
sistance in  the  coming  struggle,  and  dispatched  a  mes- 
senger to  Dunbar,  anticipating  the  surrender  of  the 
oastle  to  her  command. 

The  tidings  of  her  deliverance  flew  like  the  morn- 
ing light,  and  the  friends  of  former  days,  who  had 
continued  loyal,  with  the  forgiving  and  the  disaf- 
fected toward  Murray,  thronged  around  her  to  offer 
their  love  and  lives  to  the  beautiful  Queen  of  Scot- 
land. About  forty  bishops,  earls  and  lords,  and  a 
hundred  barons,  signed  a  league  to  place  again  the 
sceptre  in  her  hand.  In  the  presence  of  her  council, 
she  -revoked  her  abdication,  declared  Murray  a  trai- 
tor, and  found  herself,  in  a  brief  period,  at  the  head 
of  a  force  of  six  thousand  men. 

The  ambassador  of  Charles  IX.,  of  France,  sought 
her  camp,  and  recognized  her  as  the  rightful  sover- 
eign of  the  realm  j  and  Elizabeth  offered  aid  to  re-es- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

tablish  her  authority,  if  she  would  have  nothing  to  do 
with  foreign  assistance.  Mary's  situation  was  ex- 
tremely perilous,  because  if  she  triumphed  on  the 
field,  the  Hamiltons  would  urge  with  resistless  power 
the  marriage  of  a  member  of  their  family ;  if  she  lost 
the  battle  she  would  be  at  the  mercy  of  Murray.  With 
prudent  policy,  she  forwarded  to  the  regent  proposals 
of  reconciliation  between  the  two  parties.  lie  was 
at  Glasgow,  holding  a  court  of  justice,  guarded  only 
by  his  suite,  when  he  heard  of  his  sister's  safe  arrival 
at  Hamilton  Castle,  eight  miles  from  his  judicial 
hall.  Never  did  the  heroism  of  his  character,  the 
Puritan  texture,  appear  more  sublimely.  Instead  of 
flying  for  recruits  as  advised  to  do,  he  remained, 
without  betraying  the  shadow  of  a  fear  upon  his  bold 
heart,  and  won  both  the  greater  admiration  and  the 
more  determined  adherence  of  his  followers.  Re- 
questing time  to  consider  the  overtures  of  the  Queen, 
he  addressed  himself  to  the  raising  of  an  army,  which 
should  decide  in  sanguinary  conflict,  if  necessary, 
to  whom  the  crown  of  Scotland  belonged.  His  rapid, 
yet  calm  and  well  arranged  plan  of  operations,  in- 
spired his  partisans  with  courage,  and  drew  to  his 
standard  the  Presbyterian  soldiery.  Edinburgh  gave 
him  four  hundred  hackbutters;  Glasgow  offered  her 
strength;  and  Dunbar  Castle  repelled  Mary's  de 
niiind,  and  continued  true  to  the  regent.  The  Earl  of 
M;ir  hurried  to  the  camp  the  trained  men  and  heavy 
ordnance  of  Stirling;  from  the  Merse  country,  the 
chivalrous  and  brave  Alexander  Hume  brought  six 
hundred  lances ;  under  the  active,  earnest  Morton, 
the  impetuous  Glencairn,  and  the  venerable  Laird  of 
Grange,  recruits  streamed  in  from  valley  and  hill-

side,  till  four  thousand  strong  and  fearless  men  stood 
around  the  reliable  Murray,  waiting  his  command. 
With  something  of  Napoleon's  tactics,  he  directed  an 
immediate  attack  on  the  ranks  of  the  Queen,  before 
additional  volunteers  increased  her  prospect  of  vic- 
tory. Though  Mary  preferred  greater  security  of 
position,  the  Hamiltons  were  confident  of  conquest, 
and  anxious  for  battle.  They  yielded  so  far  to  her 
influence,  as  to  march  towards  Dumbarton  Castle,  an 
almost  impregnable  fortress,  with  the  determination 
to  fight  if  pursued — an  unfortunate  course,  exposing 
their  rear  to  the  foe,  and  hazarding  the  chances  of  an 
engagement,  while  in  retreat.  The  Queen's  army  had 
to  pass  from  the  left  bank  of  the  Clyde  to  the  south 
of  Glasgow,  where  Murray  had  entrenched  a  large 
body  of  troops,  to  guard  the  road.  The  veteran  Laird 
of  Grange,  according  to  his  own  advice,  occupied  the 
heights  of  Langside,  with  the  main  forces,  and  placed 
in  ambush  a  company  of  hackbutters,  beside  a  lane 
through  which  the  hostile  regiments  must  march  to 
reach  the  hill.  This  .path  was  through  a  defile,  inter- 
sected with  hedges,  and  divided  into  plantations,  with 
their  dwellings  and  foliage.  The  Queen's  cavalry, 
though  vastly  outnumbering  that  of  Murray,  could 
not  fight  with  advantage  there,  and  the  infantry,  con- 
fined and  embarrassed,  would  be  quickly  subdued. 
The  Hamiltons,  two  thousand  strong,  entered  the  de- 
file with  the  step  of  warriors  who  saw  through  the 
smoke  of  conflict,  victory  folding  her  wings  on  their 
standard,  when,  like  a  storm  of  hail  from  a  viewless 
cloud,  a  wasting  fire  was  poured  from  the  ambush 
upon  that  astonished  vanguard.  Confusion  followed, 
and  the  living  men  pressed  up  the  declivity,  ex-

h:i usted  and  scathed  hy  the  discharge  of  the  unseen 
foe.  Upon  the  summit  they  wore  mot  with  Murray's 
welcome  of  j&gt;ikem&lt; -u,  who  rushed  to  the  combat  with 
desperate  valor.  Tin-  Laird  of  (1  range  swept  from 
one  wavering  line  to  another,  to  reinforce  and  reani- 
mate; Morton,  witli  mathematical  coolness  and  pre- 
ei-ion,  made  havoc;  llmne  da.-hed  with  a  tempestuous 
and  daring  oii.-et  upon  the  ranks  of  the  enemy,  while 
Murray  made  a  hrilliant  and  decisive  charge  with  hi- 
resistless  eolumns,  on  the  reeling  host  of  Mary,  and 
the  field  was  won.  The  triumph  gained  in  three- 
quarters  of  ;m  hour  was  so  complete,  that  only  three 
hundred  of  the  Queen's  army  were  left  dead  on  the  si- 
lent eminence;  ten  pieces  of  brass  cannon  were  taken, 
and  a  large  nuinlxr  of  prisoners,  among  whom  were 
distinguished  nobles.  Mary  Stuart  had  watched  from 
a  distant  elevation  the  arena  of  battle,  where  her 
throne  was  the  contested  prize.  Her  ambitious  heart 
throbbed  with  the  excitement  of  hope,  while  her  bat- 
talions moved  through  the  leaden  hail  to  the  sum- 
mit of  Langside ;  that  heart  was  tossed  with  conflict- 
ing emotions,  as  the  carnage  deepened,  and  sank  with 
despair  when  Murray  swept  down  upon  the  wavering 
ranks.  Descending  with  haste  to  the  plain,  she 
mounted  her  horse,  and  attended  by  a  few  servants, 
rode  in  a  wild  gallop  towards  Dumfries,  neither  halt- 
ing or  slackening  speed  till  sixty  miles  lay  between 
her  and  the  scene  of  hopeless  defeat.  At  Dundren- 
nan  Abbey,  she  gazed  a  moment  on  the  waters,  and 
chose  a  bark  for  England,  instead  of  a  home  in 
France.  Relying  upon  the  repeated  a.-Hi  ranees  of 
Elizabeth's  kindness,  she  resolved  to  cast  herself  upon 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  225 

the  mercy  of  the  Queen,  to  whom  she  wrote  as  fol- 
lows: 

&lt;l  My  very  dear  sister,  without  giving  you  a  narra- 
tive of  all  my  misfortunes,  since  they  must  be  known 
to  you  already,  I  will  tell  you  that  those  of  my  sub- 
pects  whom  I  have  most  benefitted,  and  who  were 
under  the  greatest  obligations  to  me,  after  having 
revolted  against  me,  kept  me  in  prison,  and  treated 
me  with  the  utmost  indignity,  have  at  last  entirely 
driven  me  from  my  kingdom,  and  reduced  me  to  such 
a  condition  that,  after  God,  I  have  no  hope  in  any 
one  but  you." 

Lord  Herries,  who  was  with  Mary,  sent  a  request 
to  the  deputy  governor  of  Carlisle  for  permission  to 
enter  the  city ;  but  before  an  answer  could  arrive,  the 
fugitive  Queen  rashly  crossed  the  Solway  Frith,  in 
a  fisherman's  boat,  and  May  16th,  landed  at  Worth- 
ington,  on  the  Cumberland  coast.  She  immediately 
addressed  Elizabeth : 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  QUEEN  ELIZABETH. 

"  Madam  my  good  sister,  I  believe  you  are  not 
ignorant  how  long  certain  of  my  subjects,  whom  from 
the  least  of  my  kingdom  I  have  raised  to  be  the  first, 
have  taken  upon  themselves  to  involve  me  in  trouble, 
and  to  do  what  it  appears  they  had  in  view  from  the 
first.  You  know  how  they  purposed  to  seize  me  and 
the  late  King  my  husband,  from  which  attempt  it 
pleased  God  to  protect  us,  and  to  permit  us  to  expel 
them  from  the  country,  where,  at  your  request,  I

again  afterward  received  them;  though  on  their  re- 
turn they  committed  another  crime,  that  of  holding 
me  a  prisoner,  and  killing  in  my  presence  a  servant 
of  mine,  I  being  at  the  time  in  a  state  of  pregnancy. 
It  again  pleased  God  that  I  should  save  myself  from 
their  hands ;  and,  as  above  said,  I  not  only  pardoned 
them,  but  even  received  them  into  favor.  They,  how- 
ever, not  yet  satisfied  with  so  many  acts  of  kindness, 
have,  on  the  contrary,  in  spite  of  their  promises,  de- 
vised, favored,  subscribed  to,  and  aided  in  a  crime, 
for  the  purpose  of  charging  it  falsely  upon  me,  as  I 
hope  fully  to  make  you  understand.  They  have, 
under  this  pretence,  arrayed  themselves  against  me, 
accusing  me  of  being  ill  advised,  and  pretending  a 
desire  of  seeing  me  delivered  from  bad  counsels,  in 
order  to  point  out  to  me  the  things  that  required  ref- 
ormation. I,  feeling  myself  innocent,  and  desirous  to 
avoid  the  shedding  of  blood,  placed  myself  in  their 
hands,  wishing  to  reform  what  was  amiss.  They  im- 
mediately seized  and  imprisoned  me.  When  I  up- 
braided them  with  a  breach  of  their  promise,  and  re- 
quested to  be  informed  why  I  was  thus  treated,  they 
all  absented  themselves.  I  demanded  to  be  heard  in 
council,  which  was  refused  me.  In  short,  they  have 
kept  me  without  any  'servant,  except  two  women — a 
cook  and  a  surgeon ;  and  they  have  threatened  to  kill 
me,  if  I  did  not  sign  an  abdication  of  my  crown, 
which  the  fear  of  immediate  death  caused  me  to  do, 
as  I  have  since  proved  before  the  whole  of  the  nobil- 
ity, of  which  I  hope  to  afford  you  evidence. 

"  After  this,  they  again  laid  hold  of  me  in  Parlia- 
ment, without  saying  why,  and  without  hearing  me; 
forbidding,  at  the  same  time,  every  advocate  to  plead 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  227 

for  me,  and  compelling  the  rest  to  acquiesce  in  their 
unjust  usurpation  of  my  rights ;  they  have  robbed  me 
of  everything  I  had  in  the  world,  never  permitting 
me  either  to  write  or  to  speak,  in  order  that  I  might 
not  contradict  their  false  inventions. 

"  At  last,  it  pleased  God  to  deliver  me,  when  they 
thought  of  putting  me  to  death,  that  they  might 
make  more  sure  of  their  power,  though  I  repeatedly 
offered  to  answer  anything  they  had  to  say  to  me,  and 
to  join  them  in  the  punishment  of  those  who  should 
be  guilty  of  any  crime.  In  short,  it  pleased  God  to 
deliver  me,  to  the  great  content  of  all  my  subjects, 
except  Murray,  Morton,  the  Humes,  Glencairn,  Mar, 
and  Semple,  to  whom,  after  that  my  whole  nobility 
was  come  from  all  parts,  I  sent  to  say  that,  notwith- 
standing their  ingratitude  and  unjust  cruelty  em- 
ployed against  me,  I  was  willing  to  invite  them  to  re- 
turn to  their  duty,  and  to  offer  them  security  of  their 
lives  and  estates  and  to  hold  a  Parliament  for  the 
purpose  of  reforming  everything.  I  sent  twice. 
They  seized  and  imprisoned  my  messengers,  and 
made  proclamation,  declaring  traitors  all  those  who 
should  assist  me,  and  guilty  of  that  odious  crime.  I 
demanded  that  they  should  name  one  of  them,  and  I 
would  give  him  up,  and  begged  them,  at  the  same 
time,  to  deliver  to  me  such  as  should  be  named  to 
them.  They  seized  upon  my  officer  and  my  proclama- 
tion. I  sent  to  demand  a  safe  conduct  to  my  Lord 
Boyd,  in  order  to  treat  of  accommodation,  not  wish- 
ing, as  far  as  I  might  be  concerned,  for  any  effusion 
of  blood.  They  refused,  saying  that  those  who  had 
not  been  true  to  their  regent  and  to  my  son,  whom 
they  denominate  king,  should  leave  me,  and  put  them- 


o •&gt;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

selves  at  their  disposal — a  thing  at  which  the  whole 
nobility  were  greatly  offended. 

"Seeing,  therefore,  that  they  were  only  a  few.  indi- 
viduals, and  that  my  nohility  were  more  attached  to 
me  than  ever,  I  was  in  hope  that,  in  course  of  time, 
and  under  your  favor,  they  would  be  gradually  re- 
duced ;  and,  seeing  that  they  said  they  would  either 
retake  all  or  die,  I  proceeded  towards  Dumbarton, 
passing  at  the  distance  of  two  miles  from  tin-in,  my 
nobility  accompanying  me,  marching  in  order  of  but- 
tle between  them  and  me;  which  they  seeing,  sallied 
forth,  and  came  to  cut  off  my  way  and  take  me.  My 
people  seeing  this,  and  moved  by  that  extreme  malice 
of  my  enemies,  with  a  view  to  check  their  progress, 
encountered  them  without  order,  so  that,  though  they 
were  twice  their  number,  their  sudden  advance 
caused  them  so  great  a  disadvantage,  that  God  per- 
mitted them  to  be  discomfited,  and  several  killed  and 
taken ;  some  of  them  were  cruelly  killed  when  taken 
on  their  retreat.  The  pursuit  was  immediately  inter- 
rupted, in  order  to  take  me  on  my  way  to  Dumbarton ; 
they  stationed  people  in  every  direction,  either  to  kill 
or  take  me.  But  God,  through  his  infinite  goodness, 
has  preserved  me,  and  I  escaped  to  my  Lord  Herries', 
who,  as  well  as  other  gentlemen,  have  come  with  me 
into  your  country,  being  assured  that,  hearing  the 
cruelty  of  my  enemies,  and  how  they  have  treated 
UK-,  you  will,  conformably  to  your  kind  disposition, 
and  the  confidence  I  have  in  you,  not  only  receive  for 
the  safety  of  my  life,  but  also  aid  and  assist  me  in  my 
just  quarrel,  and  I  shall  solicit  other  princes  to  do  the 
same.  I  entreat  you  to  send  to  fetch  me  as  soon  as 
you  possibly  can,  for  I  am  in  a  pitiable  condition,  not 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  229 

only  for  a  Queen,  but  for  a  gentlewoman :  for  I  have 
nothing  in  the  world  but  what  I  had  on  my  person 
when  I  made  my  escape,  traveling  across  the  country 
the  first  day,  and  not  having  since  ever  ventured  to 
proceed,  except  in  the  night,  as  I  hope  to  declare  be- 
fore you,  if  it  pleases  you  to  have  pity,  as  I  trust  you 
will,  upon  my  extreme  misfortune;  of  which  I  will 
forbear  complaining,  in  order  not  to  importune  you, 
and  pray  to  God  that  he  may  give  to  you  a  happy 
state  of  health  and  long  life,  and  to  me  patience,  and 
that  consolation  which  I  expect  to  receive  from  you, 
to  whom  I  present  my  humble  commendations.  From 
Wrokinton,  the  17th  of  May. 

"  Your  most  faithful  and  affectionate  good  sister, 
and  cousin,  and  escaped  prisoner,  MARY  R." 

Elizabeth  read  this  affecting  plea  of  her  rival  with 
deep  and  contending  emotions.  The  inquiries  which 
enlisted  her  thought  and  tried  her  sympathies  were, 
whether  she  should  send  Mary  back  to  Scotland  with 
a  conquering  army,  give  her  a  home  in  England,  or 
permit  her  to  return  to  France.  Danger  environed 
each  of  these  possible  plans  of  meeting  the  extremity 
of  a  fallen  Queen.  Again  on  the  throne,  she  might 
overthrow  the  Protestant  faith,  and  renew  her  pre- 
tensions to  the  crown  of  England.  If  she  remained 
on  British  soil,  there  would  be  the  opportunity  for 
intrigues  and  conspiracies  with  the  Catholics.  Should 
Mary  retire  to  France,  the  Guises  and  court  of  that 
papal  kingdom  might  give  her  fearful  strength  to 
awaken  the  tumult  of  sanguinary  conflicts,  political 
and  religious. 

May  28th,    another  letter   was   addressed   to   the

doubting  and  suspicious  Elizabeth,  imploring  mercy. 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  qUKKN  ELIZABETH. 

"  Madam,  my  good  sister,  I  have  received  two  let- 
ters from  you,  the  first  of  which,  relating  to  myself, 
I  hope  to  answer,  and  to  learn  from  my  Lord  Scrop, 
and  your  vice-chamberlain,  your  natural  inclination 
toward  me,  which  I  have  always  promised  myself 
with  certainty,  and  wish  that  my  affection  for  you 
were  as  apparent  as  it  is  sincere,  and  then  you  would 
think  your  kindness  better  bestowed,  than  I  could 
persuade  you  by  my  humble 

"  Madam,  I  am  sorry  that  the  haste  in  which  I 
wrote  my  last  letter,  caused  me  to  omit,  as  I  perceive 
by  yours,  the  principal  thing  which  induced  me  to 
write  to  you,  and  which  is  also  the  principal  cause  of 
my  coming  into  this  kingdom,  which  is  that,  having 
for  a  long  time  been  a  prisoner,  and,  as  I  have  al- 
ready informed  you,  being  unjustly  treated,  as  well 
by  their  acts  as  by  their  false  reports,  I  wished  above 
all  to  lay  my  complaint  before  you,  as  well  on  account 
of  our  near  relationship,  equality  of  rank,  and  pro- 
fessed friendship,  as  to  clear  myself  before  you  from 
those  calumnious  charges  which  they  have  dared  to 
prefer  against  my  honor,  and  also  for  the  assurance 
I  had  that,  above  all  things,  you  would  consider  that, 
not  being  punished  for  the  crimes  committed  afore- 
time against  me,  which,  at  your  request,  I  forgave 
these  ungrateful  subjects,  and  restored  them  to  their 
former  state,  to  the  detriment  and  prejudice  of  mine, 
whence  it  is  evident,  that  out  of  respect  to  you,  I  did 
what  has  caused  my  ruin,  or  at  least  very  near  it. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  231 

With  a  view  to  repair  the  mischief,  and  to  amend  the 
error  that  has  arisen  from  it,  I  have  dispatched  my 
Lord  Herries,  my  faithful  and  well  beloved  subject, 
to  inform  you  fully  of  these  things,  and  others  con- 
cerning which  I  learned  from  Messieurs  Scrop  and 
Knowles  [Lord  Scrope  and  Sir  Francis  Knollys] 
that  you  are  in  doubt,  requesting  you  to  believe  him 
as  myself,  and  forthwith  to  let  me  have  your  answer 
in  writing,  whether  it  would  be  agreeable  to  you  if  I 
were  to  come  without  delay  and  without  ceremony  to 
you,  and  tell  you  more  particularly  the  truth  about 
all  that  has  happened  to  me,  in  contradiction  to  all 
their  lies,  which  I  am  sure  you  would  have  pleasure 
to  hear,  as  you  have  pleased  to  write  me  in  your 
letters,  that  you  could  take  my  justification  in  your 
own  hands  till  you  have  replaced  me  in  the  state  to 
which  Heaven  had  pleased  to  call  me,  and  that  all 
princes  are  bound  to  support  and  assist  one  another. 
"  I  send,  on  this  occasion,  my  cousin,  my  Lord 
Flemin,  a  faithful  subject,  in  order  that,  being  as- 
sured by  you,  he  may  proceed  to  France  to  thank  the 
king,  monsieur,  my  good  brother,  for  his  ....  and 
good  offices,  which  I  reserve  for  another  time,  if  I 
have  occasion  for  them,  contenting  myself  with  your 
aid  and  support,  which  I  shall  feel  myself  obliged  to 
acknowledge  as  long  as  I  live,  in  every  way  in  my 
power.  If,  on  the  contrary,  that  which  I  reckon  upon 
does  not  come  from  you,  and  from  some  others,  for 
considerations  which  I  am  not  aware  of,  at  least  I 
trust  that,  freely  as  I  came  to  throw  myself  into  your 
arms,  as  my  best  friend,  you  will  permit  me,  in  your 
refusal,  to  seek  succor  from  other  princes  and  friends, 
my  allies,  as  may  seem  most  convenient  to  me,  with- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

out  any  prejudice  to  the  eminent  friendship  betv 
IK*  two;  and  whatever  you  decide  will  pleaae  you,  I 
shall  be  satisfied  with,  though  one  would  have  been 
more  agreeable  to  me  than  the  other;  for,  God  be 
thanked,  I  have  got  good  friends  and  neighbors  in 
my  so  just  quarrel;  and  there  is  nothing  to  prevent 
me  from  applying  to  them  but  thi.s  detention,  which, 
to  speak  freely  to  you  as  you  do  to  me,  I  think  rather 
harsh  and  strange,  con.-i«li-ring  that  I  came  so  frankly 
into  your  country  without  any  condition,  or  any  dis- 
trust of  your  friendship,  promised  in  your  frequent 
letters;  and  though  I  have  lived  in  a  manner  a  pris- 
oner in  your  castle  for  a  fortnight,  since  the  arrival 
of  your  counsellors,  I  have  not  obtained  permission 
to  go  to  you  to  plead  my  cause,  as  my  confidence  in 
you  was  such  that  I  asked  for  nothing  more  than  to 
go  to  you  to  make  you  acquainted  with  my  grievances. 

'•  Now  I  beseech  you  to  consider  how  important  my 
long  detention  is  to  me,  and  for  the  cause  of  my  ruin, 
which,  thank  God,  is  not  gaining  ground.  Signify 
then  to  me  the  consent  of  your  natural  affection  for 
your  good  sister,  and  cousin,  and  firm  friend.  Re- 
momber  that  I  have  kept  my  promise.  I  send  you 

my in  a  ring,  and  I  have  brought 

you  the  signal,  in  order  to  tie  the  knot  more  firmly ; 
if  you  are  not  disposed  to  wrong  me  .  .  .  whom 
you  may  l^lieve  as  you  would  myself.  After  thi~ 
long  addn  •&gt;-.  I  shall  not  trouble  you  further  than  to 
present  my  auVrtion  and  recommendations  to  your 
good  grace,  and  to  pray  God  to  grant  you,  madam, 
health,  and  a  long  and  happy  life. 

"  Your  very  faithful  and     ..... 

"  Karlil,  the  28th  of  May,  1568." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  233 

Whatever  were  the  transient  impulses  of  compas- 
sion excited  by  this  plaintive  plea,  Elizabeth  adhered 
to  her  policy,  and  secretly  decided  to  keep  Mary 
Stuart  in  her  own  hands.  As  preliminary  to  the  ulti- 
mate purpose,  and  to  prepare  the  way,  she  gave  the 
captive  a  royal  journey  from  Workington  to  Carlisle, 
and  lavished  upon  her  the  honors  due  to  a  Queen. 
After  the  pageantry  of  Mary's  entry  into  the  city 
was  over,  she  was  surrounded  with  spies,  and  guarded 
by  soldiery.  Elizabeth  dispatched  letters  of  condo- 
lence, but  refused  to  see  her  until  she  had  proved 
herself  innocent  of  Darnley's  murder.  The  following 
passage  is  from  the  report  of  Lord  Scrope  and  Sir 
Francis  Knollys,  warden  and  vice-chamberlain  of  the 
border,  to  Elizabeth,  after  the  interview  of  May  28th : 

"  We  found  her  in  her  answers  to  have  an  eloquent 
tongue  and  a  discreet  head;  and  it  seemeth  by  her 
doings,  that  she  hath  stout  courage  and  liberal  heart 
adjoined  thereunto;  and,  after  our  delivery  of  your 
highnesses  letters,  she  fell  into  some  passion,  with  the 
water  in  her  eyes,  and  therewith,  she  drew  us  with 
her  into  her  bed-chamber,  where  she  complained  unto 
us,  for  that  your  highness  did  not  meet  her  expecta- 
tions, for  the  admitting  her  into  your  presence  forth- 
with ;  that  upon  good  declaration  of  her  innocence, 
your  highness  would  either  without  delay  give  her 
aid  yourself,  to  the  subduing  her  enemies,  or  else, 
being  now  come  of  good  will,  and  not  of  necessity 
into  your  hands  (for  a  good  and  greatest  part  of  her 
subjects,  said  she,  remain  fast  to  her  still)  your  high- 
ness would,  at  least,  forthwith  give  her  passage 
through  your  country  into  France,  to  seek  aid  at  other 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

prince:?'  h;ui«ls;  m&gt;t  doubting,  but  both  tho  Frewh 
king,  and  the  king  of  Spain,  would  give  her  relief  to 
her  satisfaction.  And  here  she  fell  into  discourses, 
that  the  cause  of  the  war  and  disobedient  treasons  of 
these  her  subjects,  was  thereby  to  keep  that  which 
she  had  too  liberally  given  them  by  violence;  since 
through  her  revocation  whereof,  when  of  full  age, 
they  could  not  enjoy  the  same  by  law;  and  withal 
(she  affirmed)  that  both  Lethington  and  the  Lord 
Morton  were  assisting  to  the  murder  of  her  husband." 

Lord  Herries  was  now  sent  to  London  to  negotiate 
a  loan  upon  the  Queen's  credit  as  dowager  of  France, 
with  which  to  sustain  the  cause  of  her  partizans  in 
Scotland.  Retaining  Dumbarton  Castle,  they  were 
strong  and  unyielding.  Murray  was  unsparing  and 
persevering  in  his  efforts  to  subdue  them,  but  failed 
to  exterminate  the  reanimated  foe.  Lord  Fleming 
was  chosen  to  represent  Mary's  cause  in  France,  with 
most  pathetic  messages  to  Charles  IX.,  Catherine  and 
the  Cardinal  of  Lorraine.  "  She  besought  the  French 
court  to  deliver  her  from  her  unfortunate  position  by 
sending  two  thousand  infantry  to  the  relief  of  Dum- 
barton ;  by  furnishing  the  money  and  accoutrements 
necessary  for  the  equipment  and  maintenance  of  five 
hundred  horse-soldiers;  by  sending  artillery  and  am- 
munition to  enable  her  to  recover  the  other  fortresses 
of  Scotland;  and  by  bestowing  the  order  of  St.  Mi- 
chael on  two  or  three  of  those  noblemen  who  had 
especially  distinguished  themselves  by  their  valor  and 
devotion  to  her  cause,  in  order  to  encourage  the 
others,  and  confirm  them  in  their  fidelity."  Seizing 
upon  Mary's  offer  to  establish  her  innocence,  Eliz- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  235 

abeth  determined  upon  a  formal  trial  of  the  prisoner. 
Murray  urged  it,  with  extravagant  promises  to  fur- 
nish overwhelming  evidence  of  his  sister's  guilt. 

After  some  delay,  Lords  Herries  and  Fleming,  who 
had  reached  London,  were  admitted  into  the  presence 
of  the  politic  and  ascendant  "  Virgin  Queen,"  at 
whose  tribunal  of  justice  never  was  arraigned  a  crim- 
inal of  so  manifold  gifts  and  honors,  and  around 
whom  gathered  an  interest  extensive  as  regal  sway. 
The  envoys  advocated  zealously  the  claims  of  Mary. 
Elizabeth  replied : 

"  But  her  subjects  have  discriminated  throughout 
the  world  a  scandalous  and  disgraceful  report,  of 
which  she  is  well  aware ;  her  honor  and  mine  require 
that  the  matter  should  be  looked  into — not  that  I 
should  constitute  myself  her  judge,  but  that  I  should 
inquire  of  her  accusers  what  cause  they  have  to  speak 
thus  of  her,  and  by  what  right  they  have  seized  her 
person,  her  crown,  her  fortress,  and  all  her  property, 
in  doing  which  they  cannot  be  excusable."  "  But,  mad- 
am," said  Lord  Herries,  "  if  it  should  appear  to  be 
otherwise  which  God  forbid  ? "  "  Even  then,  I 
would  not  fail  to  arrange  with  her  subjects,  in  the 
best  and  most  careful  manner  possible,  so  as  to  se- 
cure her  honor  and  provide  for  their  safety."  When, 
however,  Herries  requested  that  his  mistress  might  be 
allowed  to  withdraw  to  the  Continent,  or  at  all  events, 
to  return  to  Scotland  in  the  little  boat  which  had 
brought  her  over  to  England,  Elizabeth  absolutely  re- 
fused. "  As  for  the  passage  of  my  good  sister  into 
France,  I  will  not  prove  myself  so  imprudent  as  to 
permit  it,  and  be  thus  held  in  low  esteem  among  other 
princes.  When  she  was  there  before,  the  King,  her 


236  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

husband,  assumed  for  her  the  title  and  arms 
ing  to  lay  crown,  though  I  wa-  then  alive;  and  I  will 
not  place  my-clf  again  in  such  embarrassing  circum- 
stances  As  for  her  return  into  Scot- 
land in  the  humble  conveyance  which  you  have  men- 
tioned, sine*-  she  has  come  into  my  country,  it  would 
!*•  neither  to  her  honor  n«»r  to  mine  for  her  to  go 
hack ;  and  besides,  it  would  not  be  to  her  advantage  to 
do  so." 

Accordingly,  Elizabeth  dispatched  an  ambassador 
to  Murray,  then  leading  an  army  of  six  thousand  men 
against  the  heroic  friends  of  Mary  Stuart,  and  de- 
manded a  truce,  until  she  had  decided  the  right  to 
the  crown  of  Scotland,  and  the  criminality  of  the  con- 
tending parties.  She  relinked  the  regent  for  the  dar- 
ing deeds  which  gained  his  elevation,  and  seemed  anx- 
ious to  inspire  Mary  with  hope;  either  because  she 
felt  the  promptings  of  pity,  or  to  make  surer  work 
of  securing  her  victim ;  that  Elizabeth  was  not  alto- 
gether demoniac  in  these  complicated  interests  at 
stake,  is  clear.  In  this  strain  she  addressed  Murray: 

"  All  these  things  cannot  but  sound  very  strange 
in  the  ears  of  us,  being  a  prince  sovereign,  having  do- 
minions and  subjects  committed  to  our  power,  as  she 
had.  For  remedy  whereof  she  requireth  our  aid,  as 
her  next  cousin  and  neighbor;  and  for  justification 
of  her  whole  cause,  is  content  to  commit  the  hearing 
and  ordering  of  the  same  simply  to  us.  We  have 
thought  good  and  necessary,  not  only  to  impart  thus 
much  unto  yon,  wherewith  she  chargeth  you,  and 
others  joined  with  you,  but  also  to  require  and  advise 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  237 

you  utterly  to  forbear  from  all  manner  of  hostility 
and  persecution  against  all  such  as  have  lately  taken 
part  with  the  said  Queen,  and  to  suspend  all  manner 
of  actions  and  proceedings  against  them,  both  by  law 
and  arms,  and  to  impart  unto  us  plainly  and  suffi- 
ciently all  that  which  shall  be  meet  to  inform  us  of 
the  truth,  for  your  defence,  in  such  weighty  crimes 
and  causes  as  the  said  Queen  hath  already  or  shall 
hereafter  object  against  you,  contrary  to  the  duty  of 
natural  born  subjects;  so  that  we,  being  duly  in- 
formed on  all  parts,  may,  by  the  assistance  of  God's 
grace,  direct  our  actions  and  orders  principally  to  his 
glory,  and  next  to  the  conservation  of  our  own  honor 
in  the  sight  of  all  other  princes,  and  finally  to  the 
maintenance  and  increase  of  peace  and  concord  be- 
twixt both  these  two  realms." 

Middlemore,  the  plenipotentiary  to  Mary,  deliv- 
ered his  message  in  the  presence  of  Scrope  and 
Knollys ;  the  burden  of  which  was  the  reiterated  de- 
termination of  Elizabeth  not  to  receive  her  rival, 
until  acquitted  of  participation  in  the  recent  regicide. 
When  allusion  was  made  to  the  judgment  of  the 
Queen  of  England,  and  a  trial,  Mary  Stuart's  passion 
was  aroused,  and  she  answered  indignantly :  "  I 
have  no  other  judge  but  God,  neither  can  any  take 
upon  themselves  to  judge  me.  Of  my  own  free  will, 
indeed,  and  according  to  the  good  trust  I  reposed  in 
the  Queen,  my  sister,  I  offered  to  make  her  the  judge 
of  my  cause.  But  how  can  that  be,  when  she  will 
not  suffer  me  to  come  to  her." 

Mary  demanded  an  interview  with  Elizabeth,  or 
permission  to  depart  with  or  without  assistance,  and 


238  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

again  imploringly  wrote  t-&gt;  the  unrelenting  arbiter  of 
her  fate. 


THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  QUEEN  ELIZABETH. 

•  "  Madam,  my  good  sister — I  thank  you  for  the  dis- 
position which  you  h;ivc  to  listen  to  the  justification 
of  my  honor,  which  ought  to  be  a  matter  of  import- 
ance to  all  princes,  and  especially  to  you,  as  I  have 
the  honor  to  be  so  near  of  kin  to  you.  But  it  seems  to 
me,  that  those  who  persuade  you  that  my  reception 
would  turn  to  your  dishonor,  manifest  the  contrary. 
But,  alas,  madam,  when  did  von  ever  hear  a  prince 
censured  for  listening  in  person  to  the  grievances  of 
those  who  complain  that  they  have  been  falsely  ac- 
cused. Dismiss,  madam,  from  your  mind  the  idea 
that  I  came  hither  to  save  my  life ;  neither  the  world 
nor  all  Scotland  has  cast  me  out;  but  to  recover  my 
honor,  and  to  obtain  support  to  enable  me  to  chastise 
my  false  accusers,  not  to  answer  them  as  their  equal, 
for  I  know  that  they  ought  not  to  enter  into  engage- 
ments against  their  sovereign,  but  to  accuse  them  be- 
fore you,  that  I  hove  chosen  you  from  among  all  other 
princes,  as  my  nearest  kinswoman  and  perfect  friend  ; 
doing  as  if  I  supposed  it  to  be  an  honor  to  be  called 
the  queen-restorer,  who  helped  to  receive  this  kindness 
from  you.  »iving  you  the  honor  and  the  glory  all  ray 
life,  making  you  also  thoroughly  acquainted  with  my 
innocence,  and  how  falsely  I  have  been  led. 

"  I  see,  to  my  great  regret,  that  I  am  mistaken. 

Y&lt;&gt;u  suy  thut  you  are  counseled  by  persons  of  high 
rpnk  to  he  guarded  in  this  affair.  God  forbid  that  I 
should  IK-  C;IUM-  of  dishonor  to  you,  when  it  was  my 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  239 

intention  to  seek  the  contrary!  Wherefore,  if  you 
please,  as  my  affairs  require  such  great  haste,  let  me 
see  if  the  other  princes  will  act  in  the  same  manner, 
and  then  you  cannot  be  blamed.  Permit  me  to  see 
those  who  will  support  me  without  any  apprehension 
of  that  sort,  and  take  what  security  you  will  of  me 
when  I  shall  afterward  place  myself  again  in  your 
hands.  Though  I  think  you  would  not  desire  that, 
when  replaced  on  my  throne,  my  honors  restored,  and 
all  foreigners  out  of  the  country,  I  shall  come  to 
plead  my  cause  before  you,  and  to  justify  myself  for 
the  sake  of  my  honor  and  of  the  friendship  which  I 
bare  you,  and  not  for  the  satisfaction  I  should  have 
in  answering  false  subjects ;  or  even  sending  for  me 
without  giving  credit,  as  it  seems  you  do,  to  those  who 
are  not  worthy  of  it.  Grant  me  your  favor  and  as- 
sistance first,  and  then  you  shall  see  whether  I  am 
worthy.  If  you  find  that  I  am  not,  and  that  my 
demands  are' unjust,  or  to  your  prejudice,  or  contrary 
to  your  honor,  it  will  then  be  time  to  get  rid  of  me, 
and  to  let  me  seek  my  fortune  without  troubling  you. 
For,  being  innocent,  as  thank  God  I  know  I  am,  are 
you  not  doing  me  wrong  to  keep  me  here,  on  getting 
out  of  one  person  as  it  were  in  another,  encouraging 
my  false  enemies  to  persevere  in  their  lying  ways,  and 
disheartening  my  friends  by  delaying  the  assistance 
promised  them  from  other  quarters,  if  I  wished  to 
employ  it  ?  I  have  all  the  good  men  on  my  side, 
and  my  detention  may  bring  ruin  upon  them,  or  cause 
them  to  change  their  sentiments,  and  then  there  will 
be  a  new  conquest  to  make.  For  your  sake,  I  par- 
doned those  who  are  at  this  moment  seeking  my  ruin ; 
of  which  I  can  accuse  you  before  God,  and  .  ;  .

further  delay  will  un«l«&gt;  me.  ....  Excuse 
me,  it  is  to  me  a  matter  of  tin-  utmost  importance.  I 
must  speak  to  you  without  dissimulation.  You  have 
admitted  into  your  presence  a  bastard  brother  of 
mine,  who  tlnl  from  me.  and  you  rcfu.se  uue  the  favor, 
and  1  feel  a.-Hin-d.  that  the  juster  my  cause  the  longer 
it  will  IK-  delayed  ;  for  it  is  the  reme&lt;ly  of  a  bad  cati-e 
to  stop  the  mouth-;  of  its  adversaries;  besides,  I  know 
that  John  Wood  \vas  commissioned  to  procure  this 
detention,  as  their  mo&gt;t  certain  remedy  in  an  unjust 
quarrel  and  usurpation  of  authority. 

'•  Wherefore,  I  beseech  you,  assist  me,  binding  me 
to  you  in  everything,  or  IM-  neuter.  And  permit  me 
to  try  what  I  can  do  elsewhere,  otherwise,  by  delay- 
ing matters,  you  will  injure  me  more  than  my  very 
enemies.  If  you  are  afraid  of  blame,  at  least,  for  the 
confidence  that  I  have  placed  in  you,  do  nothing 
either  for  or  against  me,  that  you  do  and  see  that  I 
would  do  for  my  honor,  being  at  liberty.  For  here  I 
neither  can  nor  will  answer  their  false  accusations, 
though  out  of  friendship  and  for  my  pleasure,  I 
would  cheerfully  justify  myself  to  you,  but  not  in 
the  form  of  a  trial  with  my  subjects,  if  they  bark  at 
me  with  my  hands  tied.  Madam,  they  and  I  are  not 
companions  in  anything;  and  if  I  were  to  be  kept 
here  still  longer,  I  would  rather  die  than  make  myself 
such. 

"  Now,  shaking  as  your  good  sister,  let  me  be- 
li  you,  for  the  sake -of  your  honor,  without  fur- 
ther delay,  to  send  back  ray  Lord  Berries,  \\ith  the 
assurance  that  you  will  assist  me,  as  he  has  requested 
you  in  my  name:  for  I  have  no  answer  either  from 
you  or  from  him,  nor  your  license  as  above.  I  be- 


MARY  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS.  241 

seech  you,  also,  since  I  am  come  to  place  myself  in 
your  hands,  in  which  I  have  been  detained  so  long 
without  having  any  certainty,  to  order  my  Lord 
Scrope  to  allow  my  subjects  to  have  access,  if  only 
one,  two,  or  three,  to  come  and  return,  and  to  bring 
me  intelligence  about  my  subjects,  otherwise  it  would 
be  condemning  me  and  my  defenders.  God  grant 
that  you  may  listen  to  what  I  have  intended  to  say  to 
you  briefly;  I  should  not  have  troubled  you  at  such 
length,  though  I  do  not  blame  you  in  the  least  for 
these  underhand  practices  against  me;  but  I  hope, 
notwithstanding  all  their  fair  offices  and  falsely 
colored  speeches,  that  you  will  find  me  a  more  profita- 
ble friend  than  they  can  be  to  you.  I  shall  say  noth- 
ing particular  but  by  word  of  mouth.  Wherefore,  I 
shall  conclude  with  my  humble  commendations  to 
your  good  grace,  praying  God  to  grant  you,  madam 
my  good  sister,  health,  and  a  long  and  very  happy 
life. 

"  From  Carlil,  the  xiii  of  June,  1568. 
"  Your  good  sister  and  cousin, 

"  MARY  K." 

The  kings  of  Europe  were  increasingly  interested 
spectators  of  the  approaching  crisis  in  the  history  of 
a  sovereign,  whose  destiny  would  be  an  example  to 
future  monarchs.  The  Queen,  whose  extraordinary 
power  of  beauty  and  genius  won  triumphs,  had  been 
watched  from  thrones  more  remote  than  Elizabeth's, 
who  calmly  gazed  from  her  fastness,  like  a  mountain 
oagle  upon  an  invader  of  radiant  plumage,  till  the 
feared  and  envied  foe  was  bleeding  within  his  talons. 
The  crowned  heads  of  half  a  continent  saw  the  des-

perate  game,  but  occupied  with  insurrections  at  home, 
or  commotions  abroad,  offered  no  interposition. 
Montmorin,  the  envoy  of  Charles  IX.,  of  France, 
asked  Elizabeth  to  deal  kindly  with  Mary,  and  de- 
scribes his  visit  to  Carlisle: 
. .  * 

|  "  The  room  which  she  occupies  is  gloomy,  being 
'lighted  only  by  one  casement,  latticed  with  iron  bars. 
You  go  to  it  through  three  other  rooms,  which  are 
guarded  and  occupied  by  hackbutters.  In  the  last  of 
these,  which  forms  the  ante-chamber  to  the  Queen's 
apartment,  resides  Lord  Scrope,  the  governor  of  the 
border  districts.  The  Queen  has  only  three  of  her 
women  with  her.  Her  servants  and  domestics  sleep 
out  of  the  castle.  The  doors  are  not  opened  until  ten 
o'clock  in  the  morning.  The  Queen  is  allowed  to  go 
as  far  as  the  church  in  the  town,  but  she  is  always 
accompanied  by  a  hundred  hackbutters.  She  re- 
quested Scrope  to  send  her  a  priest  to  say  mass; 
but  he  answered  that  there  were  no  priests  in  Eng- 
land." 

The  cloud  of  despair  settled  down  between  Mary 
and  the  throne  of  England,  and  she  appealed  to  the 
( 'ardinal  of  Lorraine  to  save  her  sinking  fortunes 
from  complete  ruin.  Her  words  are  subduing.  "I 
entreat  you  to  have  pity  on  the  honor  of  your 
IMIOF  niece,  and  to  procure  for  me  the  support  I  need. 
Meanwhile,  I  beseech  you  to  send  me  some  money; 
for  I  have  none  wherewith  to  buy  either  food  or  cloth- 
ing. The  Queen  of  England  has  sent  me  a  little 
linen,  and  supplies  me  with  one  dish.  The  rest  I 
have  borrowed,  but  I  can  get  no  more.  You  will 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.         243 

share  in  this  disgrace.  God  is  subjecting  me  to  a 
hard  trial;  nevertheless,  rest  assured  that  I  shall  die 
a  Catholic.  God  will  quickly  remove  me  from  these 
miseries,  jfor  I  have  suffered  insults,  calumnies,  im- 
prisonment, hunger,  cold,  heat,  flight,  without  know- 
ing whither  to  go,  for  ninety-two  miles  across  the 
country  without  stopping  or  dismounting,  and  then 
being  obliged  to  sleep  on  the  hard  ground,  and  drink 
sour  milk,  and  eat  oatmeal  without  bread;  and  at 
last  I  am  come  into  this  country,  where,  as  a  reward, 
I  am  nothing  better  than  a  prisoner ;  and  meanwhile 
the  houses  of  my  servants  are  pulled  down,  and  I  can- 
not assist  them,  and  my  servants  themselves  are 
hanged,  and  I  cannot  recompense  them." 

~No  aid  was  extended,  and  the  only  alternative  for 
Mary  was  to  meet  Murray  in  trial  before  the  judicial 
bar  of  Elizabeth.  She  was  more  narrowly  guarded, 
and  the  privy  council  of  England  "  decided  unani- 
mously that  Queen  Mary  should  be  removed  from  the 
frontier  to  some  place  in  the  interior  of  the  kingdom. 
They  maintained,  moreover,  that  in  virtue  of  the  an- 
cient fuedal  superiority  of  the  crown  of  England  over 
that  of  Scotland — a  superiority  which  had  frequently 
been  asserted  by  the  one,  and  as  frequently  denied 
by  the  other — Queen  Mary  might  be  brought  to  trial ; 
that  the  wish  which  she  had  expressed  to  be  restored 
to  her  throne  before  her  innocence  had  been  proved,  or 
else  permitted  to  withdraw  to  France  before  she  had 
been  tried,  was  equally  opposed  to  the  honor  and 
safety  of  Elizabeth ;  but  that,  after  her  cause  and 
justification  had  been  thoroughly  examined,  she 
should  be  taken  back  to  her  kingdom  and  restored  to 
her  authority." 


244  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

.Inly  6th,  1568,  she  wrote  once  more  from  Carlisle 
to  Elizabeth,  repeating  her  eonilemnation  of  "  the 
rebels,"  complaining  of  additional  restraint,  and 
closes  with  this  eloquent  passage: 

"  Good  sister,  be  of  another  mind.  Even  the  heart 
ami  all  shall  be  yours,  and  at  your  commandment.  I 
thought  to  have  satisfied  you  wholly,  if  I  might  have 
•ten  you.  Alas !  do  not  as  the  serpent  that  stoppeth 
his  hearing,  for  I  am  no  enchanter,  but  your  sister 
and  natural  cousin.  If  Caraar  had  not  disdained  to 
ln-ar  &lt;&gt;r  read  the  complaint  of  an  advertiser,  he  had 
not  so  died.  AYliv  should  princes'  ears  be  stopped, 
seeing  they  are  painted  so  long;  meaning  that  they 
should  hear  all,  and  be  well  advised  before  they  an- 
swer. I  am  not  of  the  nature  of  the  basilisk,  and  less 
of  the  chameleon's,  to  turn  you  to  my  likeness;  and 
though  I  should  be  so  dangerous  and  curst  as  men  say, 
you  are  sufficiently  armed  with  constancy  and  with 
justice,  which  I  require  of  God,  who  give  you  grace 
to  use  it  well,  with  long  and  happy  life." 

Under  a  military  escort,  Mary  Stuart  was  removed 
to  the  Castle  of  Bolton,  in  Yorkshire,  a  fortress  in  the 
posses-ion  of  I. ..pi  Scrope.  PfOH  ttilg  ;m  impartial 
investigation  of  her  affairs,  Elizabeth  required  her  to 
renounce  entirely  the  claim  to  the  succession  in  Eng- 
land during  the  life  of  herself  or  is'-ue;  and  also  to 
break  the  lea»nc  with  France,  and  adopt  in  religions 
wnrship  the  forms  of  common  prayer.  Mary  at 
length  yielded  so  far  to  the  pressure  of  events,  that 
she  consented  to  the  appointment  of  commissioners  to 
arbitrate  and  settle  honorably  the  pending  and  mo- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  245 

mentous  questions  of  royalty.  The  Queen  of  Eng- 
land expressed  her  bias  and  prospective  action,  in  a 
communication  addressed  to  Murray  the  20th  of  Sep- 
tember : 

"  Whereas  we  hear  say,  that  certain  reports  are 
made  in  sundry  parts  of  Scotland,  that  whatsoever 
should  fall  out  now  upon  the  hearing  of  the  Queen  of 
Scots'  cause,  in  any  proof  to  convince  or  acquit  the 
said  Queen  concerning  the  horrible  murder  of  her 
late  husband  our  cousin,  we  have  determined  to  re- 
store her  to  her  kingdom  and  government,  we  do  so 
much  mislike  hereof,  as  we  cannot  endure  the  same 
to  receive  any  credit ;  and  therefore  we  have  thought 
good  to  assure  you,  that  the  same  is  untruly  devised 
by  the  authors  to  our  dishonor.  For  as  we  have  been 
always  certified  from  our  said  sister,  both  by  her  let- 
ters and  messages,  that  she  is  by  no  means  guilty  or 
participant  of  that  murder,  (which  we  wish  to  be 
true,)  so  surely  if  she  should  be  found  justly  to  be 
guilty  thereof,  as  hath  been  reported  of  her,  (whereof 
we  would  be  very  sorry,)  then,  indeed,  it  should  be- 
hoove us  to  consider  otherwise  of  her  cause  than  to 
satisfy  her  desire  in  restitution  of  her  to  the  govern- 
ment of  that  kingdom.  And  so  we  would  have  you 
and  all  others  think,  that  should  be  disposed  to  con- 
ceive honorably  of  us  and  our  actions." 

War  ceased  in  Scotland,  and  the  regent  made  prep- 
arations to  confront  his  sister  and  former  sovereign. 
Mary  chose  for  the  occasion,  to  represent  her  cause, 
Lesley,  the  Bishop  of  Ross,  Lords  Herries,  Boyd  and 
Livingston,  Sir  John  Gordon,  of  Lochinvar,  and  Sir 


246  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

James  Coekburn,  of  Stirling.  Murray  appeared  with 
Earl  of  Morton,  the  Protestant  Bishop  of  Orkney, 
Lord  Lindsay,  and  Robert  Pitcairn,  with  Buchanan 
and  others  as  assistants.  Elizabeth  selected  Duke  of 
Norfolk,  the  Earl  of  Sussex  and  Sir  Ralph  Sadler. 

Lethington,  who  was  involved  in  the  King's  mur- 
der, and  who  had  always  retained  an  attachment  to 
Mary,  endeavored  to  avert  the  public  inquiry,  to 
which  she  had  given  her  assent.  He  felt  that  dis- 
honor to  her  would  be  a  result,  and  forwarded  the 
letters  in  the  silver  casket  to  the  captive,  desiring  to 
know  how  he  might  serve  her  in  the  approaching 
emergency.  She  requested  Lethington  to  soften  the 
severity  of  Murray's  accusations,  and  secure  the  in- 
fluence of  the  illustrious  Duke  of  Norfolk.  The 
noble  Howard  wielded  a  controlling  influence  in  the 
privy  council,  and  over  the  kingdom.  The  third  time 
a  widower,  he  secretly  aspired  to  the  hand  of  Mary 
Stuart. 

Norfolk  immediately  united  his  jxnver  to  Lething- 
ton's  efforts  to  stay  proceedings.  In  an  interview 
with  that  disloyal  and  pliant  secretary,  he  began  his 
mediation  with  a  plan  of  reconciliation  between  the 
regent  and  his  exiled  sister.  He  thus  reprovingly 
addressed  Lethington: 

"  Is  England  judge  over  the  princes  of  Scotland  ? 
How  could  we  find  it  in  our  hearts  to  dishonor  the 
mother  of  our  future  king  ?  or  how  could  we  answer 
afterwards  for  what  we  had  done,  seeing  that,  by 
bringing  his  mother's  honesty  in  question,  we  jeop- 
ardize his  right  to  the  crown  of  England.  It  had 
been  rather  the  duty  of  you,  his  subjects,  to  cover  her 
imperfections,  if  she  had  any,  leaving  her  punish- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  247 

ment  unto  God,  who  is  the  only  judge  over  princes." 
Lethington  endorsed  these  opinions,  and  arranged 
a  meeting  of  Murray  with  Norfolk,  which  occurred  at 
night,  in  the  solitary  gallery  of  the  dwelling  of  the 
duke.  The  effect  of  the  duke's  reasoning,  on  the  evils 
which  would  inevitably  attend  a  public  defamation 
of  the  Queen,  while  nothing  but  great  imprudence  on 
the  part  of  her  accusers  could  prevent  her  ultimate 
possession  of  the  crown  of  England,  was  deep  and  in- 
fluential upon  the  discriminating  mind  of  Murray. 
The  regent  affirmed,  however,  that  the  contents  of  the 
casket  could  not  be  suppressed — the  Queen  did  not 
deny  their  origin,  and  many  had  already  seen  them. 
Norfolk  persuaded  him  not  to  use  them  as  evidence, 
and  wisely  added : 

"You  are  grievously  deceived,  if  you  imagine  the 
Queen  of  England  will  ever  pronounce  sentence  in 
this  cause.  Do  you  not  see  that  no  answers  have 
been  returned  to  the  questions  which,  upon  this  point, 
were  addressed  by  you  to  us,  and  forwarded  to  the 
Queen  ?  Nay,  you  can  easily  put  the  matter  to  a 
more  certain  proof.  Request  an  assurance,  under  the 
Queen's  hand,  that  wlien  you  accuse  your  sovereign 
and  bring  forward  your  proofs,  she  will  pronounce 
sentence.  If  you  get  it,  act  as  you  please — if  it  is 
not  given,  rest  assured  that  my  information  is  true, 
and  take  occasion  thereupon  to  stay  from  further  pro- 
ceedings." Murray  decided  to  do  no  more  than  vin- 
dicate himself,  without  attacking  Mary. 

During  these  private  negotiations  and  plots — the 
unfolding  series  of  events  in  the  life  of  a  beautiful- 
princess,  whose  far-reaching  interest  swept  over 
many  brave  and  cowardly  hearts,  both  in  the  splendor. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

and  under  the  shadow  &lt;if  thrones — the  prisoner  wrote 
a  letter  to  Elizabeth,  embracing  a  summary  of  her 
hopes,  desires  and  fears: 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  THE  QUEEN  OP  SPAIN. 

"  Madam,  my  •: 1  -i&lt;tcr — I  cannot  describe  to  you 

the  pleasure  which  I  havo  derived,  at  so  unfortunate 
a  time  for  mo,  from  your  friendly  and  consoling  let- 
ters, which  seem  as  if  sent  l&gt;v  ('rod  to  solace  me  ami&lt;l 
so  many  troubles  and  adversities  with  which  I  am 
surrounded.  I  clearly  perceive  how  much  I  am 
bound  to  praise  God  for  our  having  been  brought  up, 
fortunately  for  me,  together  in  our  youth,*  which  is 
the  cause  of  our  indissoluble  friendship,  proofs  of 
which  you  give  on  your  part.  Alas!  what  return 
can  I  make,  unless  by  loving  and  honoring  you,  and, 
if  I  should  ever  have  the  means  of  serving  you,  a-  I 
have  always  wished  to  do,  and  shall  as  long  as  I  live. 

"  Do  not  blame  me,  my  good  sister,  if  T  have  not 
written  to  you — for  I  have  been  for  eleven  months 
imprisoned,  and  so  strictly  guarded}  as  not  to  have 
either  the  means  to  write,  or  any  one  to  whom  T  could 
intrust  my  letters.  After  that,  T  was  ten  days  in 
Scotland,  and  in  a  castle  only  five  miles  distant  from 
my  enemies.  Since  then,  I  lost  the  battle.f  I  was 
obliged  to  take  refuge  here,  as  I  informed  you  by 
Montmorin.  By  the  way,  T  kiss  your  hands  for  the

regret  which  he  told  me  you  had  expressed  for  my 
misfortunes.  But  to  return  to  my  subject.  Don  Guz- 
man can  vouch  for  the  impossibility,  in  my  situation, 
'either  of  sending  a  messenger,  or  even  a  letter,  in 
'safety;  for  I  am  in  the  hands  of  people,  who  watch 
me  so  narrowly,  that  the  most  trifling  circumstance 
would  furnish  them  with  an  excuse  for  serving  me  a 
worse  turn  than  detaining  me  against  my  will ;  and 
but  for  this,  I  should  long  since  have  been  in  France. 
But  she  [Queen  Elizabeth]  has  positively  refused  to 
allow  me  to  go  thither,  and  insists  on  directing  my 
affairs,  whether  I  will  or  not.  I  cannot  give  you  here 
all  the  details,  as  they  would  be  too  long ;  but  I  have 
ordered  the  brother  of  my  ambassador  in  France,  to 
acquaint  the  ambassador  of  the  king,  your  lord,  in 
London,  with  every  particular,  that  he  may  write  to 
you  in  cipher,  otherwise  it  would  be  dangerous. 

"  I  will  tell  you  one  thing,  by  the  way ;  that  if  the 
kings,  your  lord  and  your  brother,  were  at  peace,  my 
misfortune  might  be  of  service  to  Christendom.  For 
my  coming  to  this  country  has  caused  me  to  make 
acquaintance,  by  which  I  have  learned  so  much  of 
the  state  of  things  here,  that  if  I  had  ever  so  little 
hope  of  succeeding  elsewhere,  I  would  make  ours  the 
reigning  religion,  or  perish  in  the  attempt.*  The 
whole  of  this  part  is  entirely  devoted  to  the  Catholic 
faith,  and  wi.th  the  right  that  I  have,  for  this  reason, 

*  This  letter,  written  at  the  time  when  Mary  was  making 
such  strong  professions  of  implicit  submission  to  Elizabeth, 
clearly  shows  what  England  might  have  expected,  could  Mary 
have  got  rid  of  its  detested  Protestant  sovereign,  although 
her  "  good  sister,"  and  made  good  her  own  claim  to  her 
throne. 


250  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

in  my  favor,  I  could  eaiily  teach  this  Queen  what  it 
is  to  intermeddle  and  assist  subjects  against  princes. 
She  is  extremely  jealous,  lest  this,  and  this  only, 
should  restore  me  to  my  country.  But  she  tries,  by 
all  means,  to  make  me  appear  guilty  of  what  I  have 
•so  unjustly  been  accused  of,  as  you  will  perceive  from 
a  statement  of  all  the  intrigues  which  have  been  di- 
rected against  me  ever  since  I  was  born,  by  tbois 
traitors  to  God  and  to  me.  It  is  not  yet  finished. 
Nevertheless,  I  must  tell  you  I  have  been  offered 
many  fine  things  to  change  my  religion ;  which  I  will 
never  do.  But  if  I  am  compelled  to  yield,  in  some 
points,  which  I  have  stated  to  your  ambassador,  you 
may  judge  that  it  will  be  because  I  am  a  prisoner. 
Now  I  assure  you,  and  beseech  you  to  assure  the 
king,  that  I  shall  die  in  the  Roman  Catholic  religion, 
whatever  they  may  say  to  the  contrary.  I  cannot 
exercise  it  here,  because  they  will  not  permit  me,  and, 
merely  for  having  spoken  of  it,  they  have  threatened 
to  shut  me  up  more  closely,  and  to  treat  me  with  less 
consideration. 

"  You  have  adverted  to  a  subject  in  jest,  which  I 
mean  to  take  in  good  earnest;  it  is  respecting  the 
ladies,  your  daughters.  Madam,  I  have  also  a  BOB. 
I  hope  that  if  the  king,  and  the  king  your  brother,  to 
whom  I  bog  you  to  write  in  my  behalf,  will  but  send 
an  embassy  to  this  Queen,  declaring  to  her  that  they 
do  me  tho  honor  to  rank  me  as  their  sister  and  ally, 
and  that  tlioy  are  resolved  to  take  me  under  thoir 
protection,  requiring  her  at  the  same  time,  if  she 
values  thoir  friendship,  to  send  me  back  to  my  king- 
dom, and  to  assist  me  to  punish  my  rebels;  other- 
wise, they  will  themselves  endeavor  to  do  so,  being  as- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  251 

sured  that  she  will  never  take  part  with  subjects 
against  their  sovereign ;  she  will  not  dare  to  refuse 
them,  for  she  is  herself  in  some  fear  of  insurrections. 
For  she  is  not  greatly  beloved  by  any  one  of  the  relig- 
ions, while,  God  be  praised,  I  believe  I  have  gained 
the  hearts  of  a  great  many  good  people  of  the  country, 
since  my  coming,  so  that  they  are  ready  to  hazard  all 
they  possess,  for  me  and  my  cause.  If  this  were  done, 
and  some  other  necessary  favors,  which  I  have  men- 
tioned to  your  ambassador,  being  in  my  own  country, 
and  in  friendship  with  this  Queen,  whom  her  people 
will  not  permit  to  see  me,  for  fear  I  should  lead  her 
into  a  better  track,  (for  they  are  of  opinion  that  I 
should  govern  her  if  I  studied  to  please  her,)  I  might 
then  hope  to  bring  up  my  son  in  devotion  to  your  in- 
terest ;  and  if  it  please  God  to  be  merciful  to  me,  and, 
with  your  assistance,  to  gain  for  him  that  which  be- 
longs to  us,  I  am  sure  that,  if  you  grant  him  one  of 
your  daughters,  whichsoever  you  please,  he  will  be 
but  too  happy.  They  have  almost  made  an  offer  to 
naturalize  him;  and  for  the  Queen  to  adopt  him  as 
her  son.  But  I  have  no  wish  to  give  him  up  to  them, 
and  to  resign  my  rights,  the  consequence  of  which 
would  be  to  render  him  of  their  wretched  religion. 
If  I  had  my  choice,  I  should  much  rather  send  him 
to  you,  and  risk  every  danger  to  re-establish  the  an- 
cient and  good  faith  through  this  whole  island.  I 
beg  you  will  keep  this  secret,  for  it  might  cost  me  my 
life;  yet  whatever  you  hear,  be  assured  that  I  shall 
never  change  my  opinion,  however  I  may  be  com- 
pelled to  accommodate  myself  to  circumstances. 

"  I  will  not  trouble  you  at  present  with  a  longer 
letter,  but  merely  beseech  you  to  write  in  my  behalf. 


252  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Should  I  and  this  Queen  conic  to  terms,  I  will  write 
:iml  inform  you.  B'it  it  i&gt;  necessary  that  your  ain- 
-ador  should  be  commanded  to  correspond  with 
IMC  in  cipher,  and  to  send  some  one  to  visit  me  at 
times,  as  my  attendants  dare  not  go  to  them. 

•*  I  humbly  recommend  myself  to  your  favor,  pray- 
ing God  to  give  you  health  and  a  long  and  happy 
life.  I  have  much  more  to  write  to  you,  but  I  dare 
not;  I  am  in  a  fever  about  this.  I  bog  you  to  send 
me  some  one,  in  your  especial  name,  and  one  in  whom 
I  can  place  confidence,  so  that  I  may  make  known  to 
him  all  my  intentions.  From  Bolton,  this  24th  Sep- 
tember, 1568. 

"  Your  very  humble  and  obedient  sister, 

"  MARY." 

Mary  Stuart  contemplated  the  arraignment  of  the 
regent,  but  evidently  did  not  anticipate  for  herself 
the  position  of  a  criminal  before  the  appointed  judges 
of  her  invaded  prerogative.  If  she  had  maintained 
:i  proud  refusal  to  answer  to  any  charges  preferred 
by  her  rebellion-;  subjects,  Klizaltf'th  would  not  have 
Itcen  able  to  bring  her  to  a  tribunal;  and  to  continue 
her  captivity,  would  have  l&gt;ocn  a  most  difficult  and 
dangerous  undertaking.  Tho  submission  of  Mary  to 
the  arbitration  of  her  rival,  was  not  the  least  of  the 
errors  of  her  impulsive,  ardent  nature,  whose  con- 
quering loveliness  of  person,  and  ancient  lineage  of 
royalty,  were  made  the  delusive  basis  of  undying 
hope.  A  rainbow  arched  every  storm,  to  her  vision, 
and  she  awaited,  with  the  excitement  of  consuming 
anxiety  and  expectation  of  deliverance,  the  trial. 


CHAPTER  VII. 

THE  conference  was  opened  with  pomp  and  cere- 
mony, befitting  a  court  representing  two  Queens,  a 
regent,  and  the  leading  nobles  of  both  England  and 
Scotland.  Mary  Stuart's  commissioners  boldly  as- 
serted her  regal  rights  and  honor — made  a  full  and 
lucid  statement  of  the  successive  shocks  of  revolution 
which  had  shaken  the  land  of  Bruce  to  its  centre, 
and  hurled  their  indignant  condemnation  upon  the 
rebellious  partizans  of  Murray.  The  regent  offered 
his  vindication  with  equal  boldness.  He  described 
the  impolitic  measures  and  marriages  of  the  Queen — 
the  voluntary  resignation  of  her  crown — and  her  con- 
sent to  his  acceptance  of  the  regency  from  the  enthu- 
siastic people.  He  passed  over  the  charge  of  murder, 
which  was  to  the  masses  the  unpardonable  sin  of  her 
reign,  and  which  kindled  the  anger  of  Elizabeth  more 
than  any  other  error,  excepting  the  claim  to  succes- 
sion. The  commissioners  replied  that  the  marriage 
with  Bothwell  was  an  unwilling  submission  to  the 
wishes  of  the  nobles.  To  this,  Murray  made  no  an- 
swer. Elizabeth  was  without  excuse  for  delaying  a 
personal  interview  with  Mary.  Murray  improved  the 
moment,  to  test  the  success  of  a  more  fearful  line  of 
procedure.  He  inquired  of  the  English  commission- 
ers whether,  if  he  proved  the  captive's  guilt,  she 
would  be  condemned,  and  he  continued  in  his  official 
station.  He  also  sent  a  private  messenger  to  Bolton, 

253 


254  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

to  ascertain  if  Mary  would  avoid  the  threatened  dis- 
grace by  continuing  her  abdication,  and  remaining 
in  England  with  a  royal  income.  He  then  exhibited 
to  the  lords,  representing  Elizabeth,  the  letters  of  the 
silver  casket.  Lesley  advised  Mary  to  yield  to  the 
regent's  propositions,  to  which  she  consented,  October 
13th. 

While  matters  were  on  the  eve  of  an  adjustment, 
which  would  secure  Murray's  authority  and  the 
fallen  Queen's  honor,  Elizabeth,  who  was  apprized  of 
the  secret  parley,  interposed,  and  rpmoved  the  court 
to  Westminster,  under  her  argus-eyed  inspection. 

The  conference  opened  November  25th.  *'  After 
Mary's  commissioners  had  read  a  protest  in  conform- 
ity to  the  recent  instructions  they  had  received  from 
their  sovereign,  the  lord  chancellor,  who  acted  as 
president  of  the  conference,  informed  Murray  that 
the  defence  he  had  made  at  York  was  considered  in- 
conclusive :  and,  with  a  view  to  encourage  the  regent 
to  speak  more  openly,  he  added :  '  Her  majesty  prin- 
cipally wisheth  that,  upon  the  hearing  of  this  great 
cause,  the  honor  and  estate  of  the  Queen  of  Scots  may 
l&gt;e  preserved,  and  found  sincerely  sound,  whole,  and 
firm ;  but  if  she  shall  be  justly  proved  and  found 
Kiiilty  of  the  murder  of  her  husband,  which  were 
much  to  lx&gt;  lamented,  she  shall  either  be  delivered 
into  your  hands,  upon  good  and  sufficient  sureties  and 
a~-u  ram-os  for  the  safety  of  her  life  and  good  usage  of 
her;  or  else  she  shall  continue  to  be  kept  in  England, 
in  such  sort  as  neither  the  prince  her  son,  nor  you,  the 
Earl  of  Murray,  shall  be  in  any  danger  by  her  lib- 
erty. And  for  the  time  to  come,  her  majesty  will 
maintain  the  authority  of  the  said  prince  to  be  king, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  255 

and  the  government  of  the  realm  by  you,  the  Earl  of 
Murray,  'according  to  the  laws  of  Scotland.' 

"  Somewhat  re-assured  by  this  declaration,  Murray 
spoke.  He  said  that  it  had  long  been  repugnant  to 
his  feelings  to  make  public  acts  of  a  nature  calculated 
to  sully  the  honor  of  the  mother  of  his  sovereign  in 
the  eyes  of  strangers ;  but  that  he  was  now  compelled 
by  necessity  to  defend  himself,  and  that  all  blame 
must  rest  upon  those  who  had  forced  him  to  drag  into 
light  the  proofs  which  he  had  hitherto  concealed. 
However,  as  the  verbal  declarations  which  had  been 
given  in  Elizabeth's  name  did  not  satisfy  him,  as  he 
knew  that  princess  would  readily  disavow  them,  Mur- 
ray required  an  assurance,  under  the  English  Queen's 
hand,  that  she  would  pronounce  a  judgment,  before 
he  gave  in  his  accusation.  To  this  Cecil  replied,  that 
he  had  ample  assurance  already;  and  it  ill  became 
him  to  suspect  or  doubt  the  words  of  their  royal  mis- 
tress. '  Where,'  he  added,  '  is  your  accusation  ? '  ( It 
is  here,'  answered  John  Wood,  the  regent's  secretary, 
plucking  it  from  his  bosom,  t  and  here  it  must  re- 
main till  we  see  the  Queen's  handwrit.'  As  he  spoke, 
the  Bishop  of  Orkney — who  was  dissatisfied  with  the 
regent's  vacillating  policy,  and  who  agreed  with  Mor- 
ton, Lindsay,  the  Abbot  of  Dunfermline,  and  Bu- 
chanan, in  wishing  to  put  matters  to  extremities — 
stepped  up  to  Wood,  snatched  the  paper  from  his 
hands,  and  running  to  the  table,  placed  it  before  the 
English  commissioners.  Wood  remained,  for  an  in- 
stant, motionless,  from  real  or  feigned  astonishment ; 
but  quickly  recovering  himself,  he  sprang  after  the 
bishop.  He  was,  however,  too  late  to  stop  him,  and 
was  obliged  to  resume  his  seat,  amid  the  ill-suppressed 


256  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

laughter  of  many  pre-mt.  This  scene  of  violence  and 
buffoonery  formed  the  fitting  introduction  to  the  de- 
famation of  a  Queen  by  her  own  subjects,  before  the 
subjects  of  another  sovereign. 

et  In  his  accusation,  Murray  stated  that  as  Bothwell 
was  the  author  of  Darnley's  murder,  so  the  Qn. 
his  wife,  had  persuaded  him  to  commit  it;  that  -lie 
Avas  not  only  in  the  foreknowledge  of  the  same,  but  a 
maintaincr  of  the  assassins,  as  she  had  shown  by 
thwarting  the  course  of  justice  and  by  marrying  the 
chief  executor  of  that  foul  crime.  To  give  addi- 
tional force  to  this  solemn  denunciation  of  Mary's 
culpability,  the  father  of  the  murdered  king  added 
his  demand  for  vengeance.  The  Earl  of  Lennox  pre- 
sented himself  before  the  English  commissioners,  and 
in  the  most  pathetic  language,  accused  Queen  Mary 
of  having  conspired  the  death  of  his  son,  declared  that 
until  that  moment  he  had  not  expected  to  obtain  ju&gt; 
tice,  except  at  the  hand  of  God,  but  that  he  now  laid 
his  case  in  full  confidence  before  their  lordships, 
whom  her  majesty,  the  Queen  of  England,  whose  nat- 
ural-born subject  his  son  was,  had  authorized  to  hear 
this  cause. 

"  Mary  Stuart  labored  under  a  most  terrible  accu- 
sation. Her  deputies  were  thrown  into  great  conster- 
nation, and  deliberated  for  two  days  upon  the  course 
they  ought  to  pursue.  Before  breaking  up  the  con- 
ference, in  conformity  to  the  latest  instructions  they 
had  received  from  their  sovereign,  they  repelled  th- 
imputations  which  had  been  cast  upon  her,  in  con- 
tempt of  all  divine  laws  and  human  obligations,  and 
bitterly  complained  that  so  unlawful  and  unexpected 
a  proceeding  had  been  allowed  in  England.  '  My 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  257 

lords/  they  wrote  to  the  English  commissioners,  '  we 
are  heartily  sorry  to  hear  that  our  countrymen  in- 
tend to  color  their  most  unjust,  ungrateful,  and 
shameful  doings  against  their  natural  sovereign,  liege 
lady  and  mistress,  who  hath  been  so  beneficial  to 
them.  Her  grace  hath  made  them,  from  mean  men, 
earls  and  lords ;  and  now,  without  any  evil  deserving 
on  her  part,  in  either  deed  or  word,  to  any  of  them, 
she  is  thus  recompensed  with  calumnious  and  false 
reports,  and  slandered  to  her  reproach  in  this  great 
matter,  whereof  they  that  now  pretend  herewith  to 
excuse  their  treason  were  the  first  inventors — having 
written  with  their  own  hands  that  devilish  bond,  the 
conspiracy  for  the  slaughter  of  that  innocent  young 
gentleman,  Henry  Stuart,  late  spouse  of  our  sover- 
eign, and  presented  her  in  marriage  to  their  wicked 
confederate,  James,  Earl  Bothwell,  as  was  made  man- 
ifest before  ten  thousand  people  in  Edinburgh.' 

"  After  protesting  against  what  l  these  rebels  and 
.calumniators  had  done  in  Scotland,'  Mary's  com- 
missioners affirmed  that  their  usurpation  was  not  as- 
sented to  by  an  eighth  part  of  the  kingdom,  and 
pointed  out  the  consequences  that  might  ensue  to 
other  princes,  from  granting  impunity  from  this  ex- 
ample of  successful  revolt  and  disloyal  accusation. 
*  If  this  in  them  be  tolerated,'  they  wrote,  '  what 
prince  lives  upon  the  face  of  the  earth  whose  am- 
bitious subjects  may  not  invent  some  slander,  to  de- 
prive them  of  their  supreme  authority  during  their 
lifetime  ?  Your  wisdoms  well  understand  how  far 
their  doings  exceed  the  bounds  permitted  to  subjects 
in  the  holy  and  sacred  Scriptures,  and  violate  the 
loyal  duty  which  they  owe  to  their  native  princes. 

17 


258  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

They  attributed  the  insurrection  of  Murray's  party 
in  Scotland,  not  to  any  desire  to  punish  the  murderers 
of  the  King,  but  to  their  ambition  to  govern  the 
kingdom ;  and  in  conclusion,  they  repeated  that  their 
mistress,  whose  ancestors  had  been  independent  mon- 
archs,  and  who  was  herself  an  independent  princess, 
could  not  be  judged  by  any  living  authority,  as  the 
Queen  of  England  herself  had  admitted. 

&lt;%  Their  next  step  was  to  demand  an  immediate  au- 
dience of  Elizabeth.  When  admitted  to  her  presence, 
they  complained  in  strong  terms  of  the  manner  in 
which  the  proceedings  had  been  conducted.  They 
reminded  her  of  her  promise,  that  in  the  absence  of 
their  royal  mistress,  nothing  should  be  done  which 
might  affect  her  honor  and  authority;  complained 
that,  in  violation  of  this  promise,  her  subjects  had 
been  encouraged  to  load  her  with  the  most  atrocious 
imputations;  reiterated  their  demand  that  she  should, 
in  common  justice,  be  allowed  to  appear  in  person 
and  plead  her  own  cause;  and,  meanwhile,  besought 
that  her  accusers  might  be  arrested.  This  bold  de- 
mand perplexed  Elizabeth,  but  she  extricated  herself 
from  the  dilemma  with  her  usual  astuteness.  After 
declaring  that  she  had  never  believed  the  Queen  of 
Scots  guilty  of  the  murder  of  her  husband,  she 
went  on  to  say,  that  as  the  regent  and  his  colleagues 
had  brought  this  accusation  against  her  in  their  own 
defence,  it  would  be  unjust  not  to  give  them  an  oppor- 
tunity to  prove  their  allegations.  She  had,  therefore, 
resolved  to  send  for  them,  and  to  demand  their 
proofs;  after  which  she  would  willingly  hoar  their 
mistress  in  her  own  justification.  The  partiality  of 
this  proceeding,  which  transformed  those  who  were 


MARY  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS.  259 

accused  of  rebellion  into  the  accusers  of  a  murder, 
filled  Mary's  commissioners  with  indignation.  They 
remonstrated  against  a  further  hearing  being  granted 
to  Murray,  and  ended  by  solemnly  protesting,  that 
nothing  that  might  be  done  hereafter  had  their  con- 
sent, or  should  in  any  way  prejudice  the  rights  of 
their  sovereign. 

"  Their  indignation,  however,  was  only  assumed  as 
a  cloak  for  their  alarm ;  and  whilst  they  were  most 
bitterly  inveighing  against  the  regent,  they  sent  to 
him  to  propose  a  compromise.  In  order  to  prevent 
the  production  of  those  formidable  documents,  which 
Elizabeth's  perfidious  animosity  so  ardently  desired, 
they  suggested  that  she  should  become  reconciled  to 
his  sister,  who  would,  doubtless,  restore  him  to  her 
favor,  and  give  him  and  his  adherents  every  pledge 
that  they  might  require.  But  this  was  only  a  recon- 
ciliation, whilst  Murray  and  the  lords  of  his  party  de- 
manded an  abdication.  Elizabeth,  moreover,  declared 
that  a  queen,  who  labored  under  so  grave  a  charge, 
ought  not  to  compromise  the  matter,  but  to  defend 
herself."  * 

During  these  proceedings,  Mary  wrote  a  letter  of 
condolence  and  complaint  to  the  king  of  Spain,  which 
is  a  beautiful  expression  of  sympathy  and  suffering. 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  KING  PHILIP. 

"  Most  high  and  most  puissant  prince,  my  very 
dear  and  well  beloved  brother,  cousin  and  ally,  in  the 
midst  of  my  adversity,  I  have  received,  at  the  same 
moment,  two  pieces  of  news,  from  which  it  would 
seem  that  Fortune  is  redoubling  her  efforts  to  put  an 
*  Mignet. 


o.,u  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

end  to  me  altogether.  One  of  these  is  that  of  the 
death  of  the  queen,  your  consort  madam,  my  good  ot- 
ter, whose  soul  may  God  receive!  and  tin-  "tli« -r.  that 
some  one  has  represented  to  you  that  I  am  wavering 
in  my  religion,  and  that,  to  my  misfortune,  you 
doubt,  sometimes,  whether  I  have  any  at  all.  Tl 
two  accounts  afflict  me  to  such  a  degree,  that,  though 
one  leaves  some  hope  of  solace  and  reined  \  ;  '&gt;n» 

for  the  other.  I  know  not  which  of  the  two  gri&gt; 
me  most.  I  have  reason  to  mourn,  as  I  do  with  yon. 
the  death  of  so  good  and  virtuous  a  princess,  wIi&lt;&gt;-&lt; 
loss,  I  am  sure,  will  be  most  painful  to  you.  As  for 
myself,  personally,  it  has  bereft  me  of  the  best  sister 
and  friend  I  had  in  the  world — of  her  in  whom  I  had 
the  greatest  hope;  and,  though  this  loss  is  irreparable, 
though  we  ought  to  be  resigned  to  it,  and  to  submit 
to  the  will  of  God,  who  has  been  pleased  to  take  her 
to  himself,  and  to  remove  her  from  this  life  to  enjoy 
another  much  more  happy,  still,  it  is  impossible  for 
me  to  mention,  or  even  think  of  her,  but  my  heart 
melts  into  tears  and  sighs,  while  the  love  I  bore  her 
is  incessantly  recalling  her  to  my  memory.  I  have, 
also,  particular  cause  to  be  afflicted,  as  I  am  afraid 
of  losing  that  which  she  had  in  part  gained  for  me 
with  you;  that  is  to  say,  so  good  an  opinion,  that  I 
would  be  very  sure  of  finding  in  you  that  protection 
and  favor  which  I  need  in  my  misfortunes,  as  I  am 
certain  that,  if  God  had  hut  spared  her  life  until  now, 
she  would  have  answered  to  you  for  me,  and  have  as- 
sured you  that  the  reports  made  to  you  are  absolutely 
false,  which  they  really  are.  It  is  not  long  since  I 
wrote  to  her,  and  I  remember  that,  among  other 
things,  I  intimated  my  firm  resolution  of  living  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  261 

(lying  in  the  Roman  Catholic  faith,  whatever  ill  us- 
age I  might  have  to  endure  here  on  that  account,  and 
this,  too,  before  I  had  the  least  suspicion  that  any  one 
had  endeavored  to  calumniate  me  to  you,  though  I 
have  had  a  long  experience  of  the  wickedness  of  the 
rebels  and  other  persons  of  this  country,  who  tolerate 
them,  because  they  are  all  of  the  same  sect;  but  I 
never  could  have  thought  that  calumny  could  have  so 
many  attractions  for  persons  professing  the  Catholic 
religion,  and  of  that  faith  I  believe  them  to  be  who 
prejudiced  you  against  me. 

"  I  must  now  tell  you  that,  whoever  the  person 
may  be  Avho  has  been  the  instrument  of  such  disser- 
vice, I  beseech  you  not  to  believe  him,  as  he  must  be 
misinformed ;  and  if  you  will  please  to  honor  me  by 
appointing  individuals  worthy  of  confidence,  to  make 
inquiries  of  those  persons  who  are  about  me,  and  who 
are  the  most  capable  of  answering  and  speaking  on 
any  subject  whatever,  I  am  sure  that  they  will  certify 
the  very  contrary,  for  they  have  never  heard  me  utter 
a  single  word,  or  do  the  least  thing  that  could  give 
them  so  unfavorable  an  idea  of  me. 

"  If  I  do  not  exercise  my  religion,  it  must  not  be 
concluded  that  I  waver  between  the  two.  .Besides, 
since  my  arrival  in  this  kingdom,  I  begged  to  be,  at 
least,  allowed  to  exercise  it  in  the  same  manner 
as  the  ambassador  of  a  foreign  prince  is  permitted  to 
do;  but  was  told  that  I  was  a  kinswoman  of  the 
Queen's,  and  should  never  obtain  that  indulgence. 
An  English  minister  was  afterward  sent  to  me;  he 
merely  recites  some  prayers  in  the  vulgar  tongue, 
which  I  had  not  the  power  to  prevent,  because  I  was, 
as  I  still  am,  deprived  of  my  liberty,  and  closely 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

guarded.  But  if  it  be  supposed  I  have  done  wrong 
by  being  present  at  those  prayers  which  I  attended, 
because  I  was  not  allowed  any  other  exercise  of  my 
religion,  I  am  ready  to  make  any  amends  that  may  be 
considered  necessary,  that  all  the  Catholic  princes  in 
'the  world  may  be  convinced  that  I  am  an  obedient, 
submissive,  and  devoted  daughter  of  the  holy  Catho- 
lic and  Roman  church,  in  the  faith  of  which  I  will 
live  and  die,  without  ever  entertaining  any  other  in- 
tention than  this — an  intention  from  which,  with  the 
help  of  God,  I  will  never  swerve  in  any  way  what- 
ever. 

"  But,  as  a  single  word  on  this  point  ought  to  suf- 
fice, I  will  not  trouble  you  further  on  the  subject,  ex- 
cept to  entreat  you  to  lend  a  favorable  ear  to  that 
•which  I  have  charged  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow, 
my  ambassador  at  the  court  of  France,  to  say  to  your 
resident  at  the  said  court,  that  he  may  communicate 
it  to  you. 

"  These  presents  having  no  other  object,  I  con- 
clude, very  humbly  and  affectionately  recommending 
myself  to  your  favor,  and  praying  the  Creator  to 
grant  you  a  long  and  happy  life. 

"  From  the  Castle  of  Bowton,  in  England,  the  last 
day  of  the  month  of  November,  one  thousand  five 
hundred  and  sixty-eight. 

"  Your  very  good  sister,  MABY." 

The  Scotch  deputies,  perceiving  in  the  determina- 
tion of  Elizabeth  to  make  Mary  answer  to  the  charge 
of  complicity  in  the  Darnley  murder,  and  the  proof 
which  Murray  was  to  offer  of  her  guilt  in  his  own 
defence,  augmenting  danger  to  their  Queen,  dissolved 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  263 

the  conference,  entered  a  solemn  protest  against  the 
course  of  arbitration,  and  withdrew,  under  the  osten- 
sible design  of  self-vindication.  The  regent,  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  order  of  the  English  commission- 
ers, furnished  the  contents  of  the  silver  casket,  with 
manifold  evidence  of  their  authority.  The  court  af- 
firmed the  testimony  to  be  conclusive,  and  proceeded, 
in  the  face  of  renewed  protest  and  dissolution  of  the 
conference,  to  their  illegal  yet  withering  conclusions. 
The  privy  council  of  Elizabeth  approved  the  entire 
action,  and  resolved  "  that,  as  the  crimes  wherewith 
the  Queen  of  Scots  had  been  by  common  fame  bur- 
dened, are  made  more  apparent  by  many  vehement 
allegations  and  presumptions  upon  things  now  pro- 
duced, the  Queen's  majesty  cannot,  without  manifest 
blemish  of  her  own  honor,  agree  to  have  the  said 
Queen  come  into  her  presence  until  the  said  horrible 
crimes  may  be,  by  some  just  and  reasonable  answer, 
avoided  and  removed  from  her." 

Elizabeth  made  propositions  for  permitting  Mary 
to  answer  the  fatal  documents,  which  were  promptly 
rejected.  She  also  wrote  to  the  prisoner  in  a  sym- 
pathetic strain,  but  remained  true  to  the  policy  of  an 
imperial  sway,  whose  unquestioned  possession  was 
more  precious  than  a  rival's  bleeding  heart, 

QUEEN  ELIZABETH  TO  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  Madame,  while  your  cause  hath  bene  here  treated 
upon,  we  thought  it  not  nedeful  to  write  anything 
thereof  unto  you,  supposing,  alwaies,  that  your  com- 
missioners wolde  thereof  advertise  as  they  sawe  cause. 
And  now,  sithen  they  hawe  broken  this  conference, 


iv, 4  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

by  refusing  to  make  answer  as  they  say  by  your 
commandment,  and  for  that  purpose  they  returne  to 
you ;  although  wo  thinke  you  shall  by  them  perceive 
the  whole  proceedings;  yet  we  cannot  but  let  youe 
understand  by  these  our  lettrcs,  that  as  we  have  been 
very  sorry  of  long  time  for  your  mishappes  and 
great  troubles,  so  find  we  our  sorrowes  now  dubled  in 
beholding  such  thinges  as  are  produced,  to  prove  your- 
self cause  of  all  the  same.  And  our  grief  herein  is 
also  increased,  in  that  we  did  not  think  at  any  time 
to  have  seen  or  hard  such  matters  of  so  grate  ap- 
parunce  and  moment  to  chardge  and  condemne  youe. 
Nevertheless,  both  in  frindship,  nature  and  justice, 
we  are  moved  to  couer  these  matters,  and  stay  our 
judgment,  and  not  to  gather  any  sence  thereof  to  your 
prejudice,  before  we  may  hear  of  your  direct  answer 
thereunto,  according  as  your  commissioners  under- 
stand our  meaning  to  be,  which,  at  their  request,  is  de- 
livered to  them  in  writing.  And  as  we  trust  they  will 
aduise  youe  for  your  honor  to  agree  to  make  answer, 
as  we  have  mentioned  them,  so  surely  we  cannot  but  as 
one  prince  and  nere  cousin  regarding  another,  moost 
riirnestlye  as  we  may  in  terms  of  friendship,  require 
and  chardge  you  not  to  forbeare  from  answering. 
And  for  our  parte  as  we  are  heartely  sorry,  and  dis- 
maide  to  find  such  mater  of  your  chargde;  and  al- 
though we  doubt  not  but  .you  are  well  certified  of  the 
diligence  and  care  of  your  ministers  having  your  com- 
mission, vet  can  we  not,  Ijesides  an  allowance  gener- 
ally of  them,  especially  note  to  you  your  good  choice 
of  this  bearer,  the  Bishoppe  of  Ross,  who  hath  not 
only  faithfully  and  wisely,  but  also  so  carefully  and 
dutifully,  for  your  honor  and  weale,  behaved  himself, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  265 

and  that  both  privately  and  publickly,  as  we  cannot 
but  in  this  sorte  commende  him  unto  youe,  as  we  wish 
you  had  many  such  devoted  discrete  seruuants.  For  in 
our  judgement,  we  thinke  we  have  not  any  that  in  loy- 
alty and  faithfulness  can  overmatche  him.  And  this 
we  are  the  bolder  to  write,  considering  we  take  it  the 
best  triall  of  a  good  seruante  to  be  in  aduersitie,  out 
of  which  we  wish  you  to  be  deliuered  by  the  iustifica- 
tion  of  your  innocency. 

"  And  so  trusting  to  hear  shortly  from  you,  we 
make  an  ende.  Geven  at  Hampton  Court,  under  our 
Signet  the  xxth  of  December,  1568,  in  the  Leauenthe 
year  of  Reigne. 

"  Your  good  sister  and  cousin, 

"  ELIZABETH." 

Mary  refused  to  appear  as  a  criminal,  and  dis- 
played her  great  qualities  of  character.  Amid  all  her 
calamities — changing  policy — disappointments  and 
tears,  she  had  never  despaired.  Ambitious  and  bold 
in  prosecuting  her  plans,  she  assumed  the  bearing 
and  dignity  of  a  Queen  in  the  hour  of  greatest  peril. 
She  spurned  the  thought  of  self-defence,  and  turned 
with  unsparing  attack  upon  Murray.  She  used  the 
following  language  in  a  message  to  her  commission- 
ers: I 
t  "  Forasmuch  as  the  Earl  of  Murray  and  his  adhe- 
rents, our  rebellious  subjects,  have  added  unto  their 
pretended  excuses,  produced  by  them  for  coloring 
of  their  horrible  crimes  and  offences,  committed 
against  us,  their  sovereign  lady  and  mistress,  the 
charge  that  l  as  the  Earl  of  Bothwell  was  the  princi- 


•j,;»;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

pal  executor  of  the  murder  committed  on  the  {&gt;orson 
of  Harry  Stuart,  our  late  husband,  so  we  knew,  coun- 
seled, devised,  persuaded,  and  commanded  the  said 
murder/ — they  have  falsely,  traitorously,  and  wick- 
edly lied;  maliciously  imputing  unto  us  a  crime  of 
which  themselves  were  authors  and  inventors,  and 
some  of  them  even  executors."  Repelling  tie  charge 
of  having  impeded  the  proceedings  of  justice  against 
Darnley's  murderers,  and  of  having  given  her  consent 
beforehand  to  her  marriage  with  Bothwell,  she  al- 
luded, with  consummate  ability  and  eloquence,  to  the 
danger  to  which  the  lords  declared  that  she  had  ex- 
posed her  son :  "  That  calumny,"  she  pathetically  ob- 
served, "  should  suffice  for  proof  of  all  the  rest.  The 
natural  love  of  a  mother  towards  her  bairn,  confounds 
them ;  but  in  the  malice  and  impiety  of  their  hearts, 
they  judge  others  by  their  own  affection." 

Accordingly,  the  Scotch  commissioners  presented 
their  accusations  of  regicide  against  the  regent  and 
his  friends,  sustained  and  vehemently  urged  by  the 
Bishop  of  Ross.  Upon  hearing  of  the  new  order  of 
royal  battle  for  sovereignty,  the  impetuous  Lindsay 
sent  a  challenge  to  Lord  Herries.  January  llth 
Murray  confronted  Mary's  representatives,  and  de- 
manded proof  of  their  charges.  Their  prosecution  of 
him  and  defence  of  their  Queen  were  indefinite,  and 
too  general  for  any  important  issue.  An  abdication 
\vas  again  proposed  by  Elizabeth,  as  the  only  final 
settlement  of  the  distressing  difference.  But  Mary's 
imprudence  and  guilt  had  gone  abroad  in  published 
documents,  and  she  would  not  voluntarily  resign  her 
crown,  and  in  the  act  confess  her  criminality.  She 
affirmed  to  the  commissioners, — u  the  last  words  that 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  267 

I  shall  utter  in  my  life  shall  be  the  words  of  a  Queen 
of  Scotland." 

The  conference  was  closed,  and  the  condition  of 
Mary's  affairs  was  worse  than  when  it  began.  Mur- 
ray returned  to  guard  his  throne,  with  the  consent 
and  approval  of  Elizabeth  and  her  court  Mary 
wrote  complainingly  to  the  Queen  of  England : 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  ELIZABETH. 

"  Madam  my  good  sister — I  know  not  what  occa- 
sion I  can  have  given  to  any  of  this  company,  or  at 
least  of  your  kingdom,  that  they  should  endeavor  to 
persuade  you  (as  it  appears  to  me  by  your  letter,)  of 
a  thing  so  distant  from  my  thoughts,  whereof  my 
conduct  has  borne  witness.  Madam,  I  came  to  you  in 
my  trouble  for  succor  and  support,  on  the  faith  of  the 
assurance  that  I  might  reckon  upon  you  for  every 
assistance  in  my  necessity;  and,  for  this  reason,  I 
refrained  from  applying  for  any  other  aid  to  friends, 
relatives,  and  ancient  allies ;  relying  solely  upon  your 
promised  favor.  I  have  never  attempted,  either  by 
word  or  deed,  aught  to  the  contrary,  and  nobody  can 
lay  to  my  charge  anything  against  you.  Still,  to  my 
unspeakable  regret,  I  see  my  actions  falsely  repre- 
sented and  construed ;  but  I  hope  that  God  and  time, 
the  father  of  truth,  will  declare  otherwise,  and  prove 
to  you  the  sincerity  of  my  intentions  towards  you. 

"  In  the  meantime,  I  am  treated  so  rigorously,  that 
I  cannot  comprehend  whence  proceeds  the  extreme 
indignation  which  this  demonstrates  that  you  have 
conceived  against  me,  in  return  for  the  confidence 
which  I  have  placed  in  you,  in  preference  to  all  other 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

princes,  and  the  de-ire  I  have  .-h«&gt;wn  to  obtain  your 
favor.  I  cannot  Imt  deplore  my  evil  fortune,  seeing 
you  have  I  wen  pleased  not  only  to  refuse  me  your 
presence,  can-ing  me  to  be  declared  unworthy  of  it 
by  your  nobles;  but  also  suffered  me  to  be  torn  in 
pieces  by  my  rebels,  without  even  making  them  an- 
swer to  that  which  I  have  alleged  against  them;  not 
allowing  me  to  have  copies  of  their  false  accusations, 
or  affording  me  any  liberty  to  accuse  them.  You 
have  also  permitted  them  to  retire,  with  a  decree,  in  a 
manner  absolving  and  strengthening  them  in  this 
usurped  so-called  regency,  and  have  thrown  the  blame 
upon  me,  and  covertly  condemned  me  without  giving 
me  a  hearing,  detained  my  ministers,  caused  me  to  be 
removed  by  force,  without  informing  me  what  has 
been  resolved  upon  respecting  my  affairs;  why  I  am 
to  be  transferred  to  another  abode ;  how  long  I  am  to 
remain  there;  how  I  shall  be  treated  there;  or  for 
what  reason  I  am  confined,  and  all  support  and  my 
requests  refused. 

"  All  these  things,  along  with  petty  annoyance?, 
such  as  not  ]&gt;ermittiiig  me  to  receive  news  from  my 
relatives  in  France,  nor  from  my  servants  on  my  pri- 
vate necessities,  having  in  like  manner  anew  inter- 
dicted all  communication  with  Scotland,  nay,  refused 
me  leave  to  give  any  commission  to  one  of  my  ser- 
vants, or  to  send  my  letters  by  them,  grieve  me  so 
sorely,  and  make  me,  to  tell  you  the  truth,  so  timid 
and  irresolute,  that  I  am  at  a  loss  how  to  act,  nor  can 
I  resolve  upon  obeying  so  sudden  an  order  to  depart, 
without  first  receiving  some  news  from  my  commis- 
sioners: nor  that  this  place  is  a  whit  more  agreeable 
than  any  other  which  you  may  be  pleased  to  assign; 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  269 

when  you  have  made  me  acquainted  with  your  good 
will  toward  me,  and  on  what  conditions. 

"  Wherefore,  madam,  I  entreat  you  not  to  think 
that  I  mean  any  offence,  but  a  natural  care  which  I 
owe  to  myself  and  my  people,  to  wish  to  know  the 
end  before  disposing  of  myself  so  lightly,  I  mean  vol- 
untary ;  for  I  am  in  your  power,  and  you  can,  in  spite 
of  me,  command  even  the  lowest  of  your  subjects  to 
sacrifice  me  without  my  being  able  to  do  anything 
but  appeal  to  God  and  you,  for  other  support  I  have 
none ;  and,  thank  God,  I  am  so  silly  as  to  suppose  that 
any  of  your  subjects  concern  themselves  about  the 
affairs  of  a  poor,  forlorn  foreign  prince,  who,  next  to 
God,  seeks  your  aid  alone,  and,  if  my  adversaries  tell 
you  anything  to  the  contrary,  they  are  false,  and  de- 
ceive you ;  for  I  honor  you  as  my  eldest  sister ;  and 
notwithstanding  all  the  grievances  above  mentioned,  I 
shall  be  ever  ready  to  solicit,  as  of  my  eldest  sister, 
your  friendship  before  that  of  any  other.  Would  to 
God  you  would  grant  it  me,  and  treat  me  as  I  should 
wish  to  deserve  in  your  place !  When  this  shall  come 
to  pass,  I  shall  be  happy;  if  not,  God  grant  me  pa- 
tipnce,  and  you  his  grace.  And  here  I  will  humbly 
recommend  myself  to  yours,  praying  God  to  grant 
you,  madam,  health,  and  a  long  and  happy  life. 
&lt;:  From  Bolton,  this  xxii,  of  January,  (1568-9.) 
"  Your  very  affectionate  good  sister  and  cousin, 

&lt;  MARY  K.&gt; 

Mary  again  requested  a  copy  of  the  letters  in  evi- 
dence against  her,  but  Elizabeth  denied  her,  unless 
she  would  vindicate  her  impeached  honor.  This  the 
resolute  captive  would  do  only  in  the  presence  of  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Queen  and  foreign  ambassadors.  The  hope- 
less contest  continued  for  weeks.'  Permission  was  de- 
sired in  behalf  of  Mary  Stuart,  to  leave  England,  as 
the  regent,  her  brother,  had  done.  Instead  of  com- 
plying, Elizabeth  removed  her,  under  the  care  of  the 
Karl  of  Shrewsbury,  farther  into  the  interior  of 
the  kingdom. 

"  It  was  January  26th,  1569,  that  Mary  arrived  at 
the  Castle  of  Tutbury,*  with  impressions  of  terror 
and  disgust,  which  were  somewhat  softened  by  the 
presence  of  her  faithful  friends,  Lord  and  Lady  Liv- 
ingston, Mary  Seaton,  and  a  junior  Livingston;  nor, 
to  a  heart  susceptible  as  hers  of  personal  attachment, 
could  it  be  a  matter  of  indifference,  that  in  her  re- 
duced train  of  domestics,  she  saw  many  faces  long 
familiar  to  remembrance,  f — the  experienced  Raulet, 
her  French  secretary,  and  the  gallant  William  Doug- 
lass, her  juvenile  protector.  In  the  family  of  her  new 
guardians  might  be  discovered  the  epitome  of  a  court, 
with  all  its  concomitant  suspicions  and  intrigues, 
venal  spies,  and  domestic  discords.  Naturally  liberal 
and  courteous,  the  Earl  of  Shrewsbury  was  united  to 
a  woman  whose  imperious  and  crafty  temper  con- 
stantly embittered  his  existence. 

"  In  contemplating  her  desperate  fortunes,  she  had 
no  alternative  but  to  suppress  her  discontent,  to  prac- 
tice patience,  and  assume  the  language  of  resignation. 
Instead,  therefore,  of  proclaiming  her  resentment  for 

*  Tutbury  is  a  small  town  on  the  river  Dove,  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  county  of  Stafford,  and  about  130  miles  northwest 
of  London.

the  violence  which  had  been  offered  to  her  inclina- 
tions, she  not  only  affected  to  reconcile  herself  to  a 
residence  in  Tutbury  Castle,  but  by  every  possible 
concession  labored  to  efface  those  religious  or  political 
impressions  which  might  operate  against  her  personal 
interests;  and  she  not  only  persisted  in  attending 
public  worship  according  to  the  Anglican  church,  but 
condescended  to  solicit  an  introduction  to  every  per- 
son who  visited  Lord  Shrewbury's  family." 

A  writer  has  recorded  an  interview  enjoyed  with 
Mary  at  this  time.  "  Her  grace  fell  in  talk  with  me 
on  sundry  matters,  from  six  to  seven  of  the  clock,  be- 
ginning first  to  excuse  her  ill  English,  declaring  her- 
self more  willing  than  apt  to  learn  that  language,  and 
how  she  used  translations  as  a  means  to  attain  it,  and 
that  'Mr.  \7ice-chamberlain  (Knolles)  was  a  good 
schoolmaster.'  1 1  asked  her  how  she  liked  her  change 
of  air.'  She  said,  '  If  it  might  have  pleased  her  good 
sister,  she  would  not  have  removed  at  this  time ;  but 
added  (doubtless  to  qualify  the  objection),  she  was 
better  content,  because  she  was  come  so  much  nearer 
to  the  Queen's  majesty,  whom  she  desired  above  all 
things  to  see.'  In  reply  to  this,  White  had  the 
effrontery  to  remark,  that  '  though  denied  the  actual, 
she  was  effectively  admitted  to  the  real  presence  of 
his  sovereign,  whose  affectionate  and  sisterly  care  was 
constantly  manifested  for  her  preservation.  At  the 
same  time  he  reminded  her  of  the  perils  from  which 
she  had  escaped,  and  with  solemn  mockery  felicitated 
her  singular  good  fortune  in  having  reached  this  hos- 
pitable realm,  and  received  in  it  such  honorable  and 
liberal  treatment.'  The  insolence  of  this  address  was, 
perhaps,  in  some  degree  disguised  by  quaint  and 


J7J  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

unonplace  recommendations  of  patience  and 
piety,  with  which  it  was  ahun&lt;lantly  seasoned;  and 
Mary  listened  to  the  didactic  courtier  with  apparent 
complacency,  gently  remarking,  that  'patience  was 
indeed  most  necessary  to  her  present  state,  and  that 
•she  prayed  (l..«l  t&lt;&gt;  ht&gt;t«.\v  it  on  her.'  Dismissing  sub- 
jects of  per&gt;onal  interest,  the  visitor  demanded  how 
the  Quern  pa— cd  her  time  when  debarred  by  had 
weather  from  using  exercise.  She  replied,  that  '  .-he 
spent  her  time  in  needlework,  and  that  the  variety 
of  the  colors  beguiled  the  occupation  which  she  con- 
tinued in,  till  admonished  by  the  pain  in  her  side, 
that  she  ought  to  desist.'  She  then  entered  into  a 
comparison  of  painting  with  .sculpture;  but  soon 
withdraw  to  her  apartment,  probably  to  vent  the  bit- 
terness of  her  soul  in  murmurs  against  her  pretended 
iM'iiefaetors.  Abstracted  from  the  positive  miseries 
of  her  present  situation,  Mary  created  to  herself  a 
new  source  of  torment,  by  yielding  to  suspicions  the 
most  chimerical  and  absurd.  That  in  Sir  William 
Cecil  she  had  an  enemy  she  could  not  doubt;  but  in- 
stead of  attributing  his  "hostility  t&lt;&gt;  the  true  cause, 
namely,  his  intimate  association  with  the  Regent 
Murray,  and  his  ardent  attachment  to  the  religion 
which  that  statesman  professed,  she  suffered  herself 
to  l&gt;e  persuaded  that  the  sagacious  minister  of  Eliza- 
licth  lain  .red  to  effectuate  her  exclusion  from  the 
throne  &lt;&gt;f  England,  purj&gt;osely  that  he  might  raise  to 
it  another  pretender,  the  Earl  of  Huntingdon.*  But, 
however  credulous  Mary  might  lie,  her  English  adver- 
saries appear  to  have  been  equally  addicted  to  con-

Clarence,  the  brother  of  Edward  the  Fourth. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  273 

jectural  fancies,  since  Nicholas  White  professed  to  be 
perplexed  by  the  motto  which  he  saw  embroidered  on 
her  cloth  of  estate — dans  ma  fin  est  mon  commence- 
ment [In  my  end  is  my  beginning;]  and,  for  the 
sake  of  Elizabeth,  adduced  many  reasons  why  l  the 
Queen  of  Scots  should  be  seen  as  little  as  possible ;  be- 
sides, that  she  is  a  goodly  personage,  though  not  com- 
parable to  our  sovereign ;  she  hath  withal  an  alluring 
grace,  a  pretty  Scotch  speech,  and  a  searching  wit, 
clouded  with  mildness.  Fame  might  move  some  to 
relieve  her,  and  glory  joined  to  gain,  might  stir  others 
to  adventure  much  for  her  sake ;  then  joy  is  a  lively 
impetuous  passion,  and  carrieth  many  persuasions  to 
the  heart,  which  ruleth  all  the  rest." 

Murray  was  not  at  ease  in  his  triumph.  The  Duke 
of  Norfolk  was  exasperated  because  the  regent  had 
interposed  new  obstacles  in  the  way  of  his  marriage 
to  Mary  Stuart.  Catholic  earls  were  in  a  blaze  of 
religious  enmity.  Assassination  threatened  him,  and 
it  was  only  by  stratagem  that  he  escaped.  He  ap- 
peased the  Duke  of  Norfolk  with  pleas  of  necessity  in 
appearing  as  the  accuser  of  his  sister,  and  promises 
of  kindest  interest  for  her  future  Avell-being.  Mary, 
immediately  summoned  her  energies  and  her  avail- 
able influence  to  the  work  of  attempting  a  deliverance 
from  captivity.  France  was  in  sympathy  with  her 
design,  Scotland  was  ready  to  furnish  an  armed  force, 
and  the  north  of  England  was  roused,  while  Spain 
was  moving  for  an  invasion  of  Britain.  The  Duke  of 
Chatellerault,  and  Lord  Herries,  with  Huntley  and 
Argyle,  presented  themselves  to  the  insurgent  lords, 
as  Mary's  chieftains.  Murray  retained  with  him  the 
citizens  of  the  towns,  the  Presbyterian  clergy,  and 
18

the  most  energetic,  effective  members  of  the  nobility. 
With  this  array  of  fighting  men,  and  the  reins  of  au- 
thority in  his  hands,  he  called  a  convention  of  his 
adherents  to  secure  their  formal  approval  of  his  op- 
erations, at  Stirling  Castle,  and  immediately  marched 
forth  to  surprise  the  enemy.  He  came  upon  the  Duke 
of  Chatellerault  and  Herries,  and  compelled  them  to 
make  a  treaty,  March  18th,  1569.  They  acknowledged 
the  young  King,  on  condition  of  restoring  refugees; 
and  agreed  upon  a  conference,  to  be  held  in  April, 
for  the  final  arrangement  of  conflicting  claims.  The 
regent  employed  the  truce  wisely.  He  subdued  the 
Borders,  and  strengthened  himself  for  a  controlling 
power  in  the  assembly  of  the  nobility.  The  evening 
before  it  commenced  its  sessions,  April  9th,  the  duke 
and  Herrios  received  letters  from  Mary  Stuart,  con- 
demning their  concessions  and  plan  of  pacification. 
Chatellerault  quailed  beneath  her  reproaches,  and 
slept  till  the  dawn  of  morning.  Lord  Herries  was  so 
overcome,  that  he  was  taken  severely  ill.  They 
therefore  retracted,  and  Murray  put  an  end  to  dis- 
cussion and  explanation,  by  ordering  his  guards  to 
escort  them  to  the  Castle  of  Edinburgh,  and  place 
them  under  the  care  of  Kirkaldy  of  Grange.  He 
then  marched  triumphantly  among  the  startled  ad- 
herents of  Mary,  ravaged  their  country,  and  took 
their  castles,  leaving  a  track  of  conquest  from  Inver- 
ness to  Dumfries,  from  Dunbar  to  Glasgow.  He  then 
ordered  the  assembly  of  the  estates  of  the  realm  to 
convene  July  25th,  1569.  He  was  met  at  Inverness 
upon  his  return  from  the  North,  by  Lord  Boyd,  whom 
Mary  had  dispatched  to  negotiate  with  her  brother 
concerning  articles  of  restoration  to  her  kingdom  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  275 

her  marriage  with  Norfolk.  The  duke  was  encour- 
aged in  his  ambitious  hopes,  and  a  renewal  of  his 
scheme,  which  the  disastrous  issue  of  the  conference 
interrupted.  Mary's  partizans  at  home,  and  the 
friends  of  peace  in  England,  favored  the  union  of  a 
Catholic  Queen  with  a  Protestant  duke,  whose  con- 
sanguinity to  Henry  VII.  was  an  element  of  popular- 
ity. Elizabeth  was  feeble  in  health,  and  had  made  no 
provision  for  the  succession  to  the  throne;  those  cir- 
cumstances increased  the  interest  in  the  projected 
marriage,  to  which  Mary  Stuart  consented,  contrary 
to  an  expressed  resolution  not  to  marry  again. 

Murray's  conquests  in  Scotland  had  augmented  his 
own  strength,  and  greatly  darkened  Mary's  pros- 
pects. Elizabeth  sent  to  the  convention  at  Perth,  in 
July,  three  propositions.  The  first  was  to  restore 
Mary  Stuart  to  her  throne ;  the  second,  if  more  desir- 
able, suggested  the  associating  of  young  James  with 
her  in  sovereignty ;  and  the  third,  if  the  former  were 
rejected,  was  that  the  people  of  Scotland  receive  the 
captive  as  a  private  person.  The  Queen  of  England, 
doubtless,  did  not  expect  the  acceptance  of  either, 
amid  the  hostile  parties  and  interests  of  a  distracted 
realm.  Mary  was  sadly  disappointed  in  the  issue  of 
the  discussions  at  Perth,  and  addressed  herself  to 
other  possibilities  of  success,  with  an  unflagging  en- 
ergy, which  has  a  masculine  tone,  in  singular  contrast 
with  her  charming  beauty.  She  corresponded  affec- 
tionately with  the  Duke  of  Norfolk,  who  kept  open 
doors,  and  with  the  tact  of  ancient  Absalom,  "  stole 
the  hearts  of  the  people."  Wrote  the  Ambassador 
Fenelon  to  Catherine  de  Medici : 

''  The  affairs  of  the  Queen  of  Scotland  are  obtain- 


&lt;j7i;  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

in-  great  strength  by  means  &lt;&gt;f  the  Duke  of  Xorfolk, 
who  proposes  to  marry  her  ....  and  even  if  the 
Queen  of  England  should  not  approve  of  the  scheme, 
they  will  nevertheless  carry  it  out,  so  far  are  matters 
already  advanced  ....  and  if  she  does  not  speedily 
•  resolve  to  procure  the  liberation  and  restoration  of  the 
Queen  of  Scotland,  they  will  force  her  to  do  BO 
against  her  will." 

The  watchful,  observant,  and  determined  Elizabeth 
had  heard  intimations  of  her  rival's  manifold  plans, 
and  replied  to  the  plea  of  Fenelon  in  behalf  of  Mary: 

"  I  am  aware  of  all  the  intrigues  that  have  been 
carried  on  since  she  entered  the  kingdom.  Princes 
have  large  ears,  which  hear  far  and  near.  She  has 
attempted  to  move  the  interior  of  this  realm  against 
me,  by  means  of  some  of  my  subjects,  who  promise 
her  great  things ;  but  they  are  persons  who  conceive 
mountains,  and  bring  forth  only  molehills.  They 
thought  I  was  so  foolish  that  I  should  not  perceive 
their  doings." 

The  Queen  of  England  turned  her  searching  sus- 
picion toward  the  matrimonial  plot,  and  soon  knew 
it  sill. 

When  the  perseverance  of  Norfolk,  in  the  face  of 
stern  remonstrance,  the  treachery  of  privy  counselors, 
and  the  extending  sympathy  of  the  nobility  in  the 
contemplated  alliance,  were  fully  revealed,  the  intel- 
ligent madness  of  her  rage  spread  paleness  and  trem- 
bling among  brave  and  powerful  men.  The  duke 
withdrew  into  Xorfolk,  followed  by  others  of  the  no- 
bility, to  mature  a  revolt.  Spain  had  furnished 
money  to  the  fugitive  Queen  and  her  lover.  Pope 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  277 

Pius  V.  wrote  to  the  Spanish  general  *  in  Nether- 
lands, where  he  had  just  crushed  an  insurrection: 

"  We  conjure  thy  nobleness,  and  we  beseech  thee 
with  our  whole  soul  not  to  forget  to  restore  to  liberty 
our  dear  daughter  in  Jesus  Christ,  the  Queen  of  Scot- 
land, and  again  to  establish  her,  if  possible,  in  her 
kingdom.  Thy  nobleness  could  not  undertake  any 
thing  more  agreeable  and  more  useful  to  Almighty 
God,  than  the  deliverance  of  this  Queen,  who  has  de- 
served well  of  the  Catholic  faith,  and  who  is  op- 
pressed by  the  power  of  her  heretical  enemies." 

If  there  had  been  a  united  and  fearless  uprising  of 
all  who  hated  Elizabeth,  in  connection  with  foreign 
Catholic  aid,  even  the  haughty  daughter  of  Henry 
VIII.,  and  Protestantism  also,  might  have  yielded  to 
the  political  storm.  But  no  time  was  lost  in  the  pal- 
ace of  the  mighty  Queen.  Mary  was  ordered  to  be 
taken  from  Wingfield,  one  of  the  estates  of  the  kind 
Earl  of  Shrewsbury,  and  more  closely  confined  in  the 
stronghold  of  Tutbury.  Thwarted  and  endangered, 
the  prisoner  was  undaunted.  She  wrote  to  Fenelon, 
"  I  beseech  you,  encourage  my  friends  to  be  on  their 
guard,  and  to  act  for  me  now  or  never ;  "  and  added, 
to  Norfolk,  an  earnest  entreaty  to  act  bravely,  and 
not  trouble  himself  about  her  life,  as  God  would  keep 
her  in  safety.  But  Norfolk  was  not  equal  to  the  des- 
perate game.  He  wrote  an  obsequious,  cowardly  let- 
ter to  Elizabeth,  and  in  reply,  she  commanded  his  im- 
mediate return  to  court.  Overcome  with  fear,  arising 
from  his  own  irresolution,  and  his  sovereign's  threats, 
he  went  to  London.  His  reception  was  an  arrest,  and 
imprisonment  in  the  Tower.

During  the  progress  of  these  stirring,  decisive 
events,  Mary  again  transmitted  a  message  to  Eliza- 
beth, from  a  pen  as  faithful  and  ready  in  correspond- 
ence, as  was  her  restless  brain  in  expedients  for  re- 
trieving her  lost  fortunes. 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  QUEEN  ELIZABETH. 

"  Madam,  my  good  sister,  wishing  to  exercise  to 
the  utmost  the  patience  which  it  has  pleased  God  to 
bestow  on  me  in  my  adversity,  I  have  refrained,  as 
long  as  possible,  from  importuning  you  with  my  com- 
plaints, trusting  that  time,  the  father  of  truth,  and 
your  own  good  disposition,  would  lead  you  to  perceive 
the  malice  of  my  enemies,  who  strive  to  trample  me 
to  the  earth,  and  move  you  to  pity  one  of  your  own 
blood — your  equal ;  who,  next  to  God,  has  chosen  you 
from  among  all  other  princes  for  her  refuge,  confid- 
ing in  your  favorable  letters  and  kind  promises, 
strengthened  by  the  ties  of  consanguinity  and  near 
neighborhood,  so  that  I  have  placed  myself,  voluntar- 
ily, and  without  constraint,  into  your  hands  and 
power,  where  I  have  remained  above  two  years,  some- 
times in  hopes  of  your  favor  and  support,  from  your 
courteous  letters,  at  others,  driven  to  despair  by  the 
underhand  dealings  and  the  false  reports  of  my  ene- 
mies. 

•  Nevertheless,  my  affection  for  you  has  always 
led  me  to  hope  for  the  best,  and  to  suffer  my  wrongs 
patiently;  but  now  that  you  listen  to  the  malice  of 
my  rebels,  as  the  Bishop  of  Ross  informs  me,  refusing 
to  hear  the  just  complaint  of  her  who  has  placed  her- 
self voluntarily  in  your  power,  and  thrown  herself 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  279 

Into  your  arms,  I  have  presumed  once  more  to  try  my 
fortune,  and  appeal  to  the  Queen,  my  good  sister  her- 
self. Ah,  madam,  what  stronger  proof  of  my  friend- 
ship can  I  offer  than  in  thus  putting  my  trust  in  you ! 
And,  in  return,  will  you  destroy  the  hope  which  is 
placed  in  you  by  your  sister  and  cousin,  who  neither 
can  nor  sought  to  obtain  succor  elsewhere?  Shall 
my  confidence  in  you  be  disappointed,  my  patience 
prove  vain,  and  the  friendship  and  respect  I  cherish 
for  you,  be  despised  to  such  a  degree  that  I  cannot 
obtain  what  you  could  not  justly  refuse  to  the  great- 
est stranger  in  the  world  ?  I  have  never  offended  you, 
but  have  loved  and  honored  you,  and  tried  by  all 
means  to  please  you,  and  to  assure  you  of  my  kind 
disposition  toward  you.  False  reports  have  been 
made  to  you  about  me,  which  you  have  credited  so 
far  as  to  treat  me,  not  as  a  Queen  and  relative,  come 
to  seek  support  of  you  under  your  promise  of  favor, 
but  as  a  prisoner,  to  whom  you  can  impute  the  offense 
of  a  subject. 

"  Since,  madam,  I  cannot  obtain  permission  to  de- 
clare to  you,  face  to  face,  my  sincerity  towards  you, 
at  least  permit  Monsieur  de  Rosse,  my  ambassador,  to 
give  you  an  account  of  my  public  as  well  as  private 
deportment,  and  he  has  on  many  occasions  witnessed 
the  grief  I  feel  at  not  knowing  wherein  I  have  of- 
fended you,  and  on  being  compelled  to  repeat  my  old 
requests,  respecting  which  I  beg  you  to  answer  him 
and  me  too,  namely,  that  it  may  please  you,  according 
to  my  first  requests,  to  oblige  me  forever,  by  assisting 
me  with  your  support  to  recover  the  state  to  which  it 
has  pleased  God  to  call  me  among  my  subjects,  as 
you  have  always  promised;  or  if  consanguinity,  my 


280  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

affection  for  you,  and  my  long  patience,  should  not 
seem  to  you  to  deserve  this ;  at  least  do  not  refuse  mo 
the  liberty  to  depart  as  freely  as  I  came,  and  retire 
either  to  France  or  elsewhere,  among  my  friends  and 
allies;  or  should  it  please  you  to  use  rigor,  and  treat 
me  as  an  enemy  (which  T  have  never  been  to  you,  nor 
desired  to  be,)  allow  me  to  redeem  myself  by  ransom, 
as  is  the  custom  among  all  princes,  even  those  who 
are  enemies,  and  give  me  opportunity  to  negotiate 
with  the  said  princes,  my  friends  and  allies,  for  rais- 
ing the  said  ransom. 

"  And,  meanwhile,  I  entreat  you,  as  I  have  in- 
trusted my  person  to  you,  and  offered  in  all  things  to 
follow  your  counsel,  that  I  may  not  be  injured  by  the 
extortions  of  my  rebels  against  my  faithful  subjects, 
and  that  I  may  not  be  weakened,  for  having  relied 
on  your  promises,  by  the  loss  of  Dombertran.  [Dum- 
barton. ] 

"  And  if  the  false  reports  of  my  enemies  prevent 
you  from  bestowing  any  consideration  on  these  points 
and  my  humble  requests,  and  you  are  resolved  to 
take  amiss  all  I  have  done,  with  the  intention  of 
pleasing  you,  at  least  do  not  permit  my  life  to  be  en- 
dangered without  having  deserved  it,  although 
the  Abbot  of  Donfermelin  has  spread  a  report, 
and  boasted  that  it  is  your  intention,  which  I  cannot 
believe,  to  put  me  into  the  hands  of  my  rebel  subjects, 
or  other  such  in  that  country,  whom  they  equally  ap- 
prove of,  and  with  whom  I  am  not  acquainted.  I 
protest  that  I  have  never  had  the  wish  to  offend  you, 
or  to  do  anything  which  could  displease  you;  nor 
have  merited  the  cruel  return  of  being  so  slighted, 
aa  the  Bishop  of  Rosse  has  already  assured  you,  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS.  281 

will  do  again,  if  you  but  please  to  grant  him  an  au- 
dience. Wherefore,  I  beseech  you  most  humbly,  and 
ns  above,  to  acquaint  him  with  your  determination; 
if  not  out  of  affection,  let  it  be  out  of  pity.  You  have 
experienced  what  it  is  to  suffer  affliction;  you  may 
thence  judge  what  others  suffer  from  it. 

"  You  have  listened  long  enough  to  my  enemies  and 
their  inventions  to  make  you  suspicious  of  me;  it  is 
time  to  consider  what  are  their  motives  for  this,  and 
their  double  dealing  towards  me,  and  what  I  am  to 
you,  and  the  affection  towards  you  which  has  induced 
me  to  come  to  a  place  where  you  have  such  power 
over  me.  Call  to  mind  the  offers  of  friendship  which 
you  have  made  me,  and  the  friendship  which  you 
have  promised  me,  and  how  much  I  wish  to  please 
you,  insomuch  as  to  have  neglected  the  support  of 
other  princes,  by  your  advice  and  on  the  promise  of 
yours.  Forget  not  the  rights  of  hospitality  in  my 
case  alone,  and  weigh  all  this  with  the  respect  of  your 
confidence,  honor,  and  pity  for  one  of  your  own  blood, 
and  then  I  trust  I  shall  have  no  occasion  to  repent  me. 

"  Consider  also,  madam,  what  place  I  have  filled, 
and  how  I  was  brought  up,  and,  if  experiencing,  by 
means  of  my  rebels  or  other  enemies,  so  different  a 
treatment  from  that,  from  hands  from  which  I  hoped 
for  every  comfort,  how  ill  T  can  support  such  a  bur- 
den, added  to  that  of  your  displeasure,  which  is 
hardest  of  .all  to  bear,  which  I  have  never  deserved; 
nor  to  be  so  closely  imprisoned,  that  I  have  no  means 
of  receiving  intelligence  about  my  affairs,  or  taking 
any  steps  whatever  for  settling  them,  or  consoling  in 
the  least  such  of  my  faithful  subjects  as  are  suffering 
on  my  account.  Far  am  I  from  supporting  them  as 


282  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

1  hoped.  Again  I  beseech  you,  let  not  the  false  re- 
ports and  malicious  designs  of  my  enemies  make  you 
forget  so  many  other  points  in  my  favor;  and,  lastly, 
if  nothing  else  can  move  your  natural  pity,  despise 
not  the  prayers  of  the  kings,  my  good  brothers  and 
allies,  to  whose  ambassadors  I  have  written,  begging 
them  to  make  urgent  intercession  with  you  in  my  be- 
half. 

"  And  that  you  may  not  take  it  amiss,  I  entreat 
you  to  excuse  me,  if,  in  case  you  will  not  listen  to 
your  natural  kindness  and  pity,  for  which  I  have 
loved  and  honored  you  so  much,  I  beg  them  to  inform 
the  said  kings  of  ray  necessity,  and  to  solicit  them  to 
lend  that  aid  in  my  affairs  which  I  have  expected 
from  you,  and  which  I  now  crave  from  you  before 
any  other.  If  you  are  pleased  to  grant  it  me,  as  I 
hope,  you  will  find  in  the  end  that  I  have  never  de- 
served to  lose  it.  If  in  this,  or  in  any  point  of  my 
letter,  I  offend  you,  excuse  it,  on  account  of  the  ex- 
treme urgency  of  my  cause,  and  the  infinite  trouble 
that  I  am  in. 

"  I  conclude,  by  referring  to  the  Bishop  of  Ross, 
who  will  give  you  every  information,  and  beg  you  to 
credit  him  as  myself,  who  present  my  humble  recom- 
mendations, praying  God  to  make  you  thoroughly  ac- 
quainted with  both  my  intention  and  my  conduct. 

"  From  Tiitbury,  this  x.  of  November,  [1569.] 
"  Your  very  kind  and  affectionate 

sister  and  cousin,  MARY  R. 

"  I  beg  you  to  excuse  me  if  I  write  ill,  for  my  im- 
prisonment makes  me  unwell,  and  less  capable  of  this 
or  any  other  employment." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  283 

The  Catholic  adherents  of  Norfolk  had  gone  too  far 
to  pause  in  rebellion.  After  conferring  with  the 
Pope,  and  appealing  to  interested  nobles,  they 
marched  boldly,  numbering  five  hundred  horsemen, 
toward  Durham.  Upon  a  showy  banner  was  painted 
Christ  with  the  five  bleeding  wounds,  which  was  held 
proudly  up  by  "  Old  Richard  Norton."  The  gates  of 
Durham  flew  open  at  the  approach  of  the  army ;  the 
Bible  was  burned,  the  prayer-book  destroyed,  the 
communion  table  demolished,  and  the  papal  forms  of 
worship  established  on  the  ruins.  The  rebels  issued 
a  proclamation,  and  soon  mustered  more  than  six 
thousand  cavalry  and  infantry. 

It  was  a  crisis  to  rouse  the  spirit  and  test  the  capac- 
ity of  Elizabeth.  She  arrested  Throckmorton,  the 
Bishop  of  Ross,  and  other  distinguished  friends  of 
Norfolk.  She  transferred  Mary  Stuart  to  Coven- 
try,* a  strong  castle  in  Warwickshire,  beyond  the 
possibility  of  sudden  escape,  and  with  orders  that  she 
be  executed  if  the  rebellion  succeeded.  Men-of-war 
were  commissioned  to  cruise  between  the  English 
coast  and  Netherlands,  and  Elizabeth  gathered  with 
great  rapidity  her  royal  soldiery  to  the  imperial 
standard.  The  enemy,  after  vain  attempts  to  enter 
large  towns,  besieged  Barnard  Castle,  and  at  the  end 
of  a  twelve  days'  assault,  assisted  by  mutiny  within 
its  walls,  took  the  fortress,  December  12th.  Four 
days  later,  the  insurgents,  despairing  of  victory,  dis- 
banded, and  the  chieftains  fled  for  refuge  to  Scotland. 
The  Earl  of  Northumberland  fell  into  the  hands  of 

*  Coventry  is  85  miles  northwest  of  London.  By  this  re- 
move Mary  was  brought  nearer  London,  though  she  was  des- 
tined not  to  see  the  face  of  Elizabeth  for  some  time  to  come.

Murray,  and  was  sent  to  take  Mary's  vacant  place 
in  Lochleven  Caxllc. 

To  confirm  his  shaken  authority,  Murray  now  ap- 
plied to  the  Queen  for  money  and  the  munitions  of 
war,  and  desired  that  his  sister  be  sent  to  his  safe 
keeping.  While  the  request  was  under  discussion, 
the  regent  traveled  from  Stirling  toward  Edinburgh. 
At  Linlithgow,  through  which  he  was  to  pass,  lived 
James  Hamilton,  of  Bothwell-I  laugh,  a  deadly  enemy 
of  Murray.  Confiscation,  which  was  the  spoils  of 
victory,  impoverished  him,  with  many  others.  His 
wife  had  been  turned  from  home  by  Bellenden,  a 
devoted  servant  of  the  regent,  to  whom  the  small  es- 
tate had  been  given  as  a  reward,  in  the  darkness  of 
night,  and  left  to  wander  partially  clothed  till  morn- 
ing, amid  a  desolate  forest.  When  the  dawn  il- 
lumined her  path,  reason's  light  was  quenched.  She 
was  a  despairing  maniac.  Bothwell-Haugh  swore 
vengeance  on  Murray,  as  the  responsible  author  of 
the  ravages  which  secured  the  cruel  deed.  The  re- 
gent approached  Linlithgow  with  his  imposing  train. 

"  The  Archbishop  of  St.  Andrews,  uncle  of  Both- 
well-  I  laugh,  possessed  a  house,  in  front  of  which 
Murray  and  his  cavalcade  would  necessarily  pass. 
This  house  was  placed  at  the  disposal  of  Bothwell- 
I laugh,  who  made  every  preparation  for  the  unfail- 
ing performance  of  the  act  of  vengeance  which  he 
had  concerted  with  the  other  TTamiltons.  He  took 
his  station  in  a  small  room,  or  wooden  gallery,  which 
commanded  a  full  view  of  the  street.  To  prevent  lii&gt; 
heavy  footsteps  being  heard,  for  he  was  booted  and 
spurred,  ho  placed  a  feather-bed  on  the  floor;  to  se- 
cure against  any  chance  observation  of  his  shadow, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  285 

which,  had  the  sun  broke  out,  might  have  caught  the 
eye,  he  hung  up  a  black  cloth  on  the  opposite  wall; 
and,  having  barricaded  the  door  in  front,  he  had  a 
swift  horse  ready  saddled  in  the  stable  at  the  back. 
Even  here  his  preparations  did  not  stop ;  for,  observ- 
ing that  the  gate  in  the  wall  which  enclosed  the  gar- 
den was  too  low  to  admit  a  man  on  horseback,  he  re- 
moved the  lintel  stone,  and,  returning  to  his  chamber, 
cut,  in  the  wooden  panel  immediately  below  the  lat- 
tice window,  where  he  watched,  a  hole  just  sufficient 
to  admit  the  barrel  of  his  caliver.  Having  taken 
these  precautions,  he  loaded  the  piece  with  four  bul- 
lets, and  calmly  awaited  his  victim." 

Murray  was  warned  to  avoid  High  street,  because 
rumors  were  rife  of  fatal  plots.  But  the  dense  crowd 
flocked  the  way,  and  he  rode  calmly  forward,  amid 
the  loud  shouts  of  an  excited  populace.  When  he 
reached  the  archbishop's  house,  Hamilton  took  cool 
and  fatal  aim  at  the  noble  form  of  Murray.  There 
was  a  startling  report,  and  the  regent  reeled  from  his 
horse,  while  the  silence  of  horror,  broken  with  mut- 
tered wrath,  fell  suddenly  upon  the  exultant  throngs. 
Then  they  rushed  like  sounding  surges  toward  the 
house,  from  which  Hamilton  fled  before  an  entrance 
could  be  made,  and  reached  safely  Hamilton  Castle. 
He  was  welcomed  by  the  Archbishop  of  St.  Andrews 
and  nobles  present.  The  same  day,  January  20th, 
1570,  Murray  died.  He  expired  placidfy  as  the  set- 
ting sun,  in  Christian  faith  and  hope.  He  was  a 
great  and  heroic  man,  upon  the  surface  of  whose 
splendid  career  were  acts  of  violence  and  treachery, 
not  excusable,  yet  scarcely  avoidable,  from  the  in- 
trigues and  pressure  of  tempestuous  times.  His  peo- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

pie  called  him  the  Good  Regent,  and  his  administra- 
tion of  justice  entitled  him  to  the  compliment.  A 
sincere  Protestant,  his  court  wore  ever  the  air  and 
sober  livery  of  the  Puritan  religion.  Ambitious,  and 
not  always  just,  his  tragical  death  is  another  illus- 
.tration  of  the  uncertainty  and  brevity  of  earthly 
honors. 

The  fall  of  this  brilliant  ruler,  whose  virtues,  con- 
sidering all  the  circumstances  of  history,  altogether 
transcended  his  errors,  reanimated  the  faction  of 
Mary  Stuart.  The  Hamiltons  again  took  the  field; 
Lethington,  and  other  distinguished  captives  of  Mur- 
ray were  released ;  the  Pope  issued  a  sentence  of  ex- 
communication and  deposition  against  Elizabeth,  to 
revenge  the  Catholics;  and  a  certain  Leonard  Dease, 
of  Gilsland,  had  raised  the  standard  of  insurrection, 
with  three  thousand  men.  The  Queen  of  England 
felt  that  danger  threw  ominous  shadows  upon  her 
throne.  The  Earl  of  Surrey  and  Lord  Scrope  were 
sent  to  ravage  Scotland  on  the  east  and  west,  and  the 
Earl  of  Lennox  was  dispatched  to  guide  the  party  of 
his  son,  young  James  VI.,  in  the  place  of  the  mur- 
dered Murray.  During  these  bloody  expeditions, 
Mary  wrote  to  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow,  urging 
her  cause : 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  THE  ARCHBISHOP  OP  GLAS- 
GOW. 

"  TUTBUBY,  30th  April,  (1570.) 
"Monsieur  de  Glascow — I  would  not  for  the  world 
neglect  things  of  importance  to  me,  or  which  concern 
my  duty  to  God ;  and  hence  it  is  that,  seeing  an  array 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  287 

in  my  country,  and  a  most  injurious  proclamation 
issued  against  me,  I  have  risked  this  dispatch  to  the 
king,  monsieur  my  good  brother,  and  to  the  queen, 
and  to  all  my  relatives,  wherein  I  have  recommended 
you  to  them,  and  begged  them  to  afford  you  the  best 
means  for  applying  yourself  to  my  affairs.  I  there- 
fore inform  you  of  this,  that  you  may  act  accord- 
ingly ;  and,  whatever  may  come  of  it,  I  beg  you  on  no 
account  to  be  absent  from  court  at  a  time  so  impor- 
tant as  this,  but  to  urge  warmly  the  promised  sup- 
port. 

"  The  rest  I  write  you  in  cipher,  but  this  I  wished 
to  signify  with  my  own  hand,  to  inform  you  of  the 
need  that  I  and  mine  have  of  prompt  assistance.  In 
short,  make  one  last  effort  for  your  Queen  and  good 
mistress,  your  country  and  kindred,  and  after  me, 
for  your  future  prince.  The  Bishop  of  Ross  has  in- 
formed me  of  a  deanery  which  I  have  given  him  to 
keep  him  in  my  service,  for  he  has  nothing  whatever 
in  Scotland.  I  beg  him  to  get  this  matter  settled 
forthwith,  and  desire  that  George  *  be  dispatched 
from  London  without  difficulty,  for  his  services  merit 
it,  and  the  good  example  he  has  set  is  important  at 
this  moment.  James  and  Baron  are  in  my  employ, 
and  are  not  gone  to  him  but  with  a  promise  to  be  al- 
ways faithful  to  me.  It  is,  therefore,  my  intention 
that  their  wages  be  paid  them,  about  which  you  will 
give  directions  to  my  treasurer;  and  the  same  in  re- 
gard to  Henri  Kir  in  quality  of  secretary ;  and  I  shall 
be  very  glad  when  Roullet  returns,  and  send  me,  if 
you  can  obtain  it,  a  passport  for  Thomas  Levingston 
to  come  to  serve  me ;  for  should  Graf urd  go  abroad, 
*  George  Douglas. 


288  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

and  I  think  he  will,  I  shall  not  have  any  gentlemen 
attendants  left,  and  they  will  not  permit  any  to  come 
to  me  from  Scotland.  So,  referring  to  my  cipher, 
and  what  you  will  hear  from  the  bearer  of  this,  I  will 
conclude,  praying  God  to  have  you  in  his  holy  keep- 
ing. 

"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

R" 


The  captive  Queen  again  addressed  her  represen- 
tative at  the  court  of  France  on  the  13th  of  May, 
commending  Douglas,  who,  it  will  be  recollected, 
served  her  while  at  Lochleven  Castle,  and  giving  a 
glimpse  of  her  imprisonment  : 

THE  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS   TO  THE  ARCHBISHOP  OF  GLAS- 

GOW. 

"  Monsieur  de  Glascow  —  George  Douglas  having 
obtained  permission  to  visit  me,  and  to  make  his  apol- 
ogies, and  to  beg  that  I  would  arrange  his  affairs  in 
such  manner  as  I  may  judge  proper,  provided  that 
what  I  have  given  be  secured  to  him,  should  I  think 
he  merits  it,  or  at  least,  that  he  may  be  put  to  the 
proof  if  he  has  ever  offended  me,  explaining  that 
what  he  wrote  to  me  had  no  other  object  than  to  let 
me  know  that,  rather  than  I  should  doubt  his  fidelity, 
or  before  he  would  seek  an  appointment  without  my 
leave,  he  would  relinquish  all  that  I  had  given  him, 
or  might  give  him.  I  have  been  very  glad  to  afford 
him  an  opportunity  to  state  his  reasons,  from  the  de- 
sire I  have  that  he  should  give  me  as  much  occasion 
to  be  a  good  mistress  to  him  in  future,  and  from  the 
pleasure  I  shall  feel  in  recompensing  the  great  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  289 

signal  service  which  he  has  done  me,  and  which,  he 
says,  he  wishes  to  continue  to  do  me  as  long  as  he 
lives,  of  which  I  have  no  doubt ;  and  in  consequence 
of  this,  I  have  not  only  favorably  received  his  excuses 
and  justifications,  but  relieved  him  from  all  fear  that 
I  shall  ever  listen  to  any  report  to  his  disadvan- 
tage, without  first  hearing  him.  I  inform  you  of 
this  purposely,  that  you  may  cause  him  to  be  paid 
quarterly,  as  usual,  wherever  he  may  be,  according 
to  the  capacity  under  which  he  is  entered,  notwith- 
standing the  commands  I  formerly  gave  you  and 
others  to  the  contrary. 

"  As  respects  myself,  my  health  is  but  very  indif- 
ferent. I  am  strictly  guarded,  and  without  any 
means  of  arranging  my  affairs,  either  here,  or  in 
Scotland,  or  abroad,  unless  M.  de  la  Mothe,  by  com- 
mand of  the  king,  takes  pity  upon  me.  I  have  but 
just  thirty  persons — men,  women,  servants  and  offi- 
cers— as  you  Avill  perceive  by  the  list  and  the  new  or- 
ders, which  will  show  whether  I  am  a  prisoner  or  not. 

"  Roullet  has  a  continual  fever,  which  is  the  reason 
why  I  cannot  write  to  you  more  at  length,  which 
would  be  troublesome  to  me  just  now.  Several  of 
my  people  are  ill;  so  is  also  M.  de  Ross,  and  so  he 
hears  nothing  about  my  affairs,  and  my  people  are 
badly  treated,  as  M.  de  Ross  will  inform  you.  I  beg 
you  will  represent  all  this  to  the  king,  the  queen,  his 
mother,  and  messieurs,  his  brothers,  requesting  they 
will  send  some  one  to  speak  in  my  behalf. 

"  Awaiting  your  reply  to  this  by  Kir,  I  will  con- 
clude by  recommending  myself  to  your  favor,  and 
praying  God  to  grant  you  a  long  and  happy  life.

290  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  Send  me  a  physician,  consulting  Lusgerie,  to 
whom  I  beg  you  to  remember  me;  and  as  regards 
your  own  affairs,  tell  me  what  you  think  would  suit 
you,  and  I  will  write  immediately  to  support  you,  for 
I  am  aware  of  your  necessities. 
.  .  "  I  had  forgotten  to  tell  you  that,  as  to  the  order 
for  a  thousand  francs,  which  is  in  your  hands,  you 
must  retain  eight  hundred,  and  give  the  remainder  to 
Kir,  for  the  purpose  of  paying  his  debts.  I  have  also 
granted  him  another  thousand,  by  virtue  of  a  letter  I 
have  written  to  my  treasurer,  and  which  will  serve  as 
an  order,  until  such  time  as  you  send  one  for  my  sig- 
nature, also  for  the  purpose  of  paying  his  debts  there ; 
these  two  thousand  francs  must  be  deducted  from  the 
gift  which  I  made  him.  I  beg  you  will  not  fail 
doing  this ;  and  for  your  security,  this  present,  signed 
by  my  hand,  must  suffice  until  you  send  me  an  order, 
as  I  fear  my  treasurer  will  not  honor  any  but  written 
orders. 

"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MAKY  R 

"  If  M.  the  cardinal  is  at  too  great  a  distance,  send 
him  my  letters  by  some  one,  and  forward  to  me  his 
answer,  and  meanwhile,  let  me  know  by  Kir,  what  is 
your  opinion,  and  what  will  be  the  best  and  safest 
means  of  securing  his  money,  and  the  most  conven- 
ient manner  for  me  to  pay  it." 

July  12th,  the  Earl  of  Lennox  was  formally  elected 
regent  of  Scotland,  while  the  Duke  Chatellerault,  and 
the  Earls  Huntley  and  Argyle  were  the  leaders  of  the 
opposing  faction,  which  was  nearly  equal  in  strength 
to  the  royal  administration. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.         291 

Elizabeth,  upon  the  restoration  of  the  regency, 
evacuated  the  kingdom,  and  opened  a  discussion  of 
the  treaty  with  Mary  Stuart,  which  was  proposed  the 
year  before  at  Perth. 

After  a  protracted  consideration  at  Chatsworth,* 
where  she  had  been  confined  since  May,  the  conditions 
were  mainly  accepted,  and  the  prisoner's  heart  was 
wild  with  hope  and  gladness.  Her  weary  form  be- 
came elastic,  and  her  pale  face  luminous  with  antici- 
pated deliverance.  To  Elizabeth  she  wrote: 

"  No  scruple  now  remains  to  prevent  our  sincere 
and  reciprocal  friendship,  which  I  desire  beyond  that 
of  any  other  prince,  in  proof  of  which  I  consent  to 
place  in  your  hands- the  dearest  jewel  and  only  com- 
fort which  God  has  given  me  in  this  world,  my  only 
and  beloved  son,  whose  education,  though  desired  by 
many,  is  entrusted  to  you,  to  be  preferred  both  by 
him  and  by  me  to  all  others. 

"  My  intention  is  sincere  to  observe  the  conditions 
agreed  on  between  us,  and  I  am  resolved  hencefor- 
ward, in  order  to  end  my  unfortunate  voyage,  to  cast 
my  anchor  in  the  port  of  your  natural  goodness  to- 
wards me.  Having  recourse,  instead  of  any  other 
surety,  to  the  merit  of  my  humble  submission  and 
obedience,  which  I  offer  you  as  though  I  had  the 
honor  to  be  your  daughter  (as  I  have  be  your  sister 

*  Chatsworth,  the  seat  of  the  Duke  of  Devonshire,  was  the 
most  splendid  private  residence  in  England,  perhaps  in  Europe. 
It  is  located  on  the  river  Derwent,  in  the  county  of  Derby, 
and  is  about  30  miles  due  north  of  Tutbury,  Mary's  former 
place  of  activity.

smd  next  cousin,)  and  yielding  to  none  in  desire  to 
obey  and  honor  you  in  future,  may  it  please  you  to 
accept  me  as  entirely  yours." 

Mary  alludes  to  the  treaty  in  a  letter  upon  the 
death  of  John  Beton,  a  near  friend,  whom  she  sin- 
'cerely  mourned : 

TO  MONSIEUR  DE  GLASGOW,   MY  AMBASSADOR   IN 
FRANCE. 

"From  CHATSWORTH,  October,  [1570.] 
"  Monsieur  de  Glascow — Instead  of  relieving  you, 
as  I  hoped,  by  these  letters,  from  all  anxiety,  and  as- 
suring you  by  this  dispatch  of  the  entire  confidence 
which  I  place  in  you,  and  the  satisfaction  which  it 
gave  me  to  receive  so  high  a  testimony  of  the  sin- 
cerity of  your  conduct,  as  that  given  me  by  the  car- 
dinal, my  uncle,  in  his  letter,  I  am  obliged,  to  my 
extreme  regret,  to  communicate  a  mournful  circum- 
stance, which  has  caused  me  the  deepest  sorrow,  as 
Koullet  and  others  of  your  good  friends  can  testify. 
In  short,  God  has  at  one  stroke  afflicted  you  and  me, 
by  taking  from  us  your  brother,  the  only  minister 
whom  I  selected  to  comfort  and  counsel  me,  in  this 
my  long  affliction  and  banishment  from  among  my 
good  servants  and  friends.  We  are  bound  to  praise 
God  for  all  things,  a  point  on  which  you  can  better 
admonish  me  than  I  you,  but  more  especially  ought 
we  to  praise  him,  because  he  died  a  good  Christian, 
a  good  man,  Moved  by  every  one,  regretted  both  by 
friends  an&lt;l  cnrniMs:  but  above  all  by  me,  who,  hav- 
ing performed  the  duty  of  a  kind  mistress  and  frit-mi. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  293 

in  seeing  him  properly  treated  and  attended  to,  served 
as  a  witness  of  his  good  end,  solemnizing  with  my 
tears  the  close  of  his  life,  and  accompanying  his  soul 
with  my  prayers.  Now  he  is  happy,  and  there, 
whither  we  must  all  hope  to  go,  while  I  am  deprived, 
amid  all  my  afflictions,  of  a  faithful  and  tried  ser- 
vant. The  sorrow  and  grief  which  I  know  you  will 
feel  for  his  death,  would  make  me  apprehensive  of 
losing  you  likewise,  so  incessant  are  become  the  at- 
tacks of  misfortune,  were  I  not  aware  of  the  good 
sense  you  possess,  and  that  your  fear  of  God,  and 
your  great  zeal  for  my  interest,  will  cause  you  to  sub- 
mit to  his  will,  and  to  take  care  of  yourself  in  order 
to  serve  me. 

"  I  have  made  up  my  mind  to  have  your  other 
brother  about  me,  and  in  the  same  capacity  as  the  de- 
ceased, thereby  confirming  the  gift  made  to  the  latter, 
agreeably  to  his  last  wish,  which  he  called  me  to  wit- 
ness. I,  therefore,  beg  you  to  send  him  to  me,  fully 
instructed  as  to  what  you  may  desire  I  should  do  for 
you  and  yours,  relying  upon  it  that  I  shall  exert  my- 
self as  zealously  as  for  any  servant  I  have,  and  more 
so.  He  had  tAvo  of  his  relatives  and  servants  here; 
the  one  named  Arelin  Bethem,  who  was  formerly 
with  me,  and  whom,  for  his  sake,  I  shall  be  most 
willing  to  serve  whenever  occasion  may  offer;  the 
other,  Thomas  Archibald,  whom  I  have  taken  into 
my  household,  and  am  equally  disposed  to  serve.  If 
I  could  do  more  to  show  how  much  I  loved  and  es- 
teemed your  late  brother,  most  gladly  would  I  do  it. 

"  As  to  yourself,  Roullet  can  bear  witness  how  lit- 
tle heed  I  gave  to  those  who  wished  to  lessen  you  in 
my  good  opinion ;  to  prove  this  to  you,  I  will  either 


294  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

make  Quantly,  on  wliuni  all  the  blame  is  thrown,  con- 
fess his  fault,  for  which  IK-  shall  be  rewarded  accord- 
ing to  his  deserts,  &lt;&gt;r  y;ive  the  name  of  his  author, 
•which  I  shall  transmit  to  M.  the  cardinal  and  you,  so 
that  you  can  consult  together,  and  for  your  satisfac- 
tion take  such  steps  as  you  may  consider  necessary  for 
your  honor,  and  for  making  public  the  high  opinion 
and  confidence  I  have  in  you,  of  which  I  beg  you  to 
be  assured ;  and  as  a  proof  that  you  may  not  doubt 
the  assurance  which  I  give  you  of  my  favor,  take  all 
the  care  you  can  of  yourself,  that  you  may  serve  me 
whenever  it  may  please  God  that  I  shall  return  to 
my  country,  where  I  hope  to  have  you  near  me,  M 
one  of  the  pillars  on  which  I  shall  found  ray  gov- 
ernment. 

"  If  this  treaty  be  soon  concluded,  I  shall  be  very 
glad  to  see  you  here.  In  the  meantime  I  shall  write 
you  a  full  account  of  my  affairs  by  the  bearer  of  this, 
whom  I  beg  you  will  send  back  as  soon  as  possible 
with  your  answer,  as  there  are  certain  points  concern- 
ing which  it  is  necessary  that  I  should  have  a  reply 
in  a  month.  I  have  signed  an  acknowledgment  for 
something  that  I  owe  him ;  I  beg  you  will  get  his 
business  dispatched,  and  send  him  back  to  me  forth- 
with. 

"  Make  my  apologies  to  those  to  whom  I  have  not 
written  with  my  own  hand;  for,  since  the  death  of 
Beton,  I  have  had  a  complaint  in  one  eye,  which  is 
much  inflamed,  and  I  think  that  the  pleasure  I  take 
in  writing  to  you  will  not  amend  it,  as  you  will  per- 
ceive from  the  first  page. 

"  Now,  to  conclude,  I  pray  God  to  comfort  you, 
and  to  be  assured  of  my  good  will  and  gratitude  for 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  295 

your  good  services ;  and  send  your  brother  to  me,  for 
I  have  no  one  here  to  attend  upon  me,  and  to  give 
orders  to  my  household,  and,  besides,  he  belongs  to 
you;  though  I  am  sure  you  have  a  good  friend  in 
Roullet,  and  a  friend  in  Seyton,  who  will  be  as  ready 
in  your  absence  to  render  you  the  services  of  a  good 
friend,  as  a  relation,  or  any  other  person  that  you 
might  have  about  me,  both  for  the  affection  which 
she  bears  toward  all  those  whom  she  knows  to  have 
been  faithful  servants  to  me,  and  on  account  of  the 
kindness  she  feels  for  her  good  friends,  among  whom 
she  reckoned  your  deceased  brother,  whose  soul  may 
God  take  into  his  keeping;  and  grant  consolation  to' 
you  and  to  me,  an  end  to  my  afflictions,  or  patience 
to  bear  them  according  to  his  good  pleasure,  to  whom 
be  praise,  in  good  or  in  evil. 

"  Your  very  kind  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MAEY  K." 

But  Mary  was  doomed  to  speedy  disappointment. 
Charles  IX.  of  France,  and  other  foreign  princes,  dis- 
approved of  parts  of  the  treaty.  Elizabeth  embraced 
the  embarrassments  as  a  sufficient  reason  for  closing 
the  negotiation ;  and  the  promise  of  a  pacific  disposal 
of  conflicting  interests  was  entirely  blasted.  Mary 
was  beneath  a  sky  of  deeper  gloom  than  ever  before 
since  her  captivity.  "  During  the  two  years  and  a 
half  which  she  had  been  a  prisoner  in  England,  she 
had  sought  to  obtain  her  deliverance  and  restoration 
by  the  exertions  of  her  party  in  Scotland,  by  her 
marriage  with  the  head  of  the  English  nobility,  by 
the  insurrection  of  Elizabeth's  Catholic  subjects,  by 
the  union  of  the  Scottish  lords,  sustained  by  the  court 


20fi  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

of  Franco,  after  Murray's  death,  and,  finally,  by  an 
accommodation  with  her  fortunate  and  powerful 
rival.  All  attempts  had,  however,  failed.  The 
Scotch  who  were  faithful  to  her  cause,  had  been  over- 
come by  Murray  in  1569,  and  weakened  by  Eliza- 
beth in  1570 ;  her  marriage  with  the  Duke  of  Norfolk 
had  met  with  but  little  favor  in  Scotland,  and  had 
been  positively  prohibited  in  England ;  the  English 
Catholics  had  twice  revolted,  and  had  been  twice  de- 
feated ;  the  accommodation  negotiated  at  Chatsworth, 
with  so  many  concessions  on  her  part,  had  been  re- 
jected; and  France  had  not  only  failed  to  support 
her,  but  seemed  likely  to  renounce  her  ancient  league 
•with  Scotland,  to  form  a  new  alliance  with  England." 
She  now  turned  to  Philip  II.  of  Spain,  whom  she 
hoped  might  be  persuaded  to  attempt  an  invasion  of 
England.  To  do  this,  she  must  assure  him  of  the  co- 
operation of  the  Duke  of  Norfolk  at  the  head  of  an 
armed  force,  whenever  the  allies  landed  on  English 
soil.  Mary  had  maintained  a  familiar  correspon- 
dence with  Norfolk  in  cipher  unknown  to  Elizabeth. 
The  plague,  which  was  raging  in  London,  entered 
the  Tower,  and  the  duke  was  permitted  to  retire  to  a 
private  residence,  partially  guarded,  upon  a  solemn 
promise  to  close  forever  all  communication  with 
Mary  Stuart,  and  abandon  the  design  of  marriage. 
With  the  doom  of  a  traitor  impending  if  he  broke  his 
pledge,  to  which  he  consented,  he  immediately  re- 
newed the  most  tender  expressions  of  affection  for  the 
prisoner,  and  she  reciprocated  the  devotion  in  her  own 
ardent  and  eloquent  language.  He  was  thereupon 
ripe  for  a  conspiracy,  the  last  resort  of  thwarted  am- 
bition. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  297 

The  Bishop  of  Ross,  in  connection  with  the  Floren- 
tine Ridolfi,  matured  the  plan  of  operations.  Ridolfi 
was  a  wealthy  banker,  a  relative  of  the  Medici  family, 
and  a  man  of  great  influence  with  the  English  nobil- 
ity. The  Duke  of  [Norfolk  was  consulted,  and  the 
Florentine  dispatched  to  the  Duke  of  Alva,  residing 
at  Brussels.  Through  this  Catholic  counselor  and 
general,  it  was  hoped  that  an  appeal  to  the  Pope  and 
Philip  II.  would  secure  soldiers  and  arms  for  de- 
throning the  Queen  of  England,  and  restoring  Mary 
to  sovereignty.  The  fading,  defeated  captive  en- 
gaged with  youthful  enthusiasm  in  the  plot.  The 
Duke  of  Alva  thus  addressed  King  Philip  on  the  sub- 
ject : 

"  Considering  the  pity  and  interest  with  which  the 
unworthy  treatment  of  the  Queen  of  Scotland  and 
her  adherents  cannot  fail  to  inspire  your  majesty; 
considering  the  obligation  under  which  you  are  placed 
by  God,  to  obtain  by  all  means  in  your  power,  the 
triumphant  restoration  of  Catholicism  in  those  isl- 
ands; considering,  moreover,  the  injuries  which  the 
Queen  of  England  does  in  so  many  ways,  and  on  so 
many  sides,  to  your  majesty  and  your  subjects,  with- 
out any  hopes  of  being  on  better  terms  with  her,  as 
regards  religion  and  neighborhood,  as  long  as  she 
reigns;  it  appears  to  me  that  the  plan  of  the  Queen 
of  Scotland  and  the  Duke  of  Norfolk,  if  it  could  be 
properly  carried  out,  would  be  the  best  method  of 
remedying  the  evil. 

"  If  the  secret  were  not  kept,  the  enterprise  would 
fall  to  the  ground;  the  lives  of  both  the  Queen  of 
Scotland  and  the  Duke  of  Norfolk  would  be  endan-

gcred ;  the  Queen  of  England  would  find  the  oppor- 
tunity, which  she  has  sought  so  long,  for  getting  rid 
of  her  and  her  partisans;  the  hopes  of  the  Catholic 
religion  would  be  crushed  forever,  and  the  whole- 
would  recoil  upon  your  majesty.  .  .  .  Wherefore, 
no  one  can  think  of  advising  your  majesty  to  furni.-h 
the  assistance  sought  of  you,  under  the  form  in  which 
it  is  requested.  But  if  the  Queen  of  England  should 
die,  either  a  natural  death  or  any  other  death,  or  if 
her  person  should  be  seized  without  your  majesty's 
concurrence,  then  I  should  perceive  no  further  diffi- 
culty. The  proposals  between  the  Queen  of  England 
and  the  Duke  of  Anjou  would  cease,  the  French 
would  be  less  fearful  that  your  majesty  should  seek 
to  become  master  of  England,  the  Germans  would 
look  upon  you  with  less  distrust,  since  you  would 
have  no  other  object  but  to  sustain  the  Queen  of  Scot- 
land against  the  rival  claimants  of  the  crown  of  Eng- 
land. In  that  case,  it  would  be  easy  to  reduce  them 
to  reason  before  other  princes  could  interfere,  as  we 
could  profit  by  the  convenience  of  the  Duke  of  Nor- 
folk's county,  where  we  could  disembark  the  six  thou- 
sand men  he  requires,  not  within  the  forty  days 
during  which  he  could  maintain  himself  unassisted, 
but  within  thirty  or  twenty-five  days." 

July  7th,  1571,  Ridolfi  divulged,  at  the  Escurial, 
the  scheme  of  conspiracy.  It  was  to  murder  Eliza- 
beth while  she  was  traveling,  and  one  James  Graffs 
was  the  accepted  assassin ;  then  revolution  would  fin- 
i&lt;li  the  papal  work  in  both  kingdoms.  While  the 
iimdo  of  &lt;lestroying  the  English  Queen,  and  other 
points  in  the  bold  design,  were  under  exciting  discus- 
sion in  the  Spanish  court,  and  among  interested 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  299 

princes,  suspicion,  first  awakened  in  the  mind  of  the 
vigilant  Cecil,  by  letters  from  Bailly,  who  was  con- 
fined in  Marshalsea  prison  on  account  of  an  open  de- 
fence of  Mary,  led  to  a  full  disclosure  of  the  plot. 
These  letters  were  directed  to  the  Bishop  of  Ross,  and 
related  to  the  conspiracy.  Bailly  was  removed  to  the 
Tower  and  put  on  the  rack. 

He  confessed  all  he  knew,  establishing  the  exist- 
ence of  the  daring  combination,  but  did  not  reveal 
the  names  of  the  guilty  parties.  In  this  uncertainty 
the  affairs  continued,  until  several  months  later,  when 
civil  war  in  Scotland  was  resumed  with  terrific  sever- 
ity. The  Archbishop  of  St.  Andrews  was  captured 
by  the  Earl  of  Lennox  and  executed.  His  death  lent 
an  unsparing  cruelty  to  the  contest.  Mary,  in  a  brief 
letter  to  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow,  disclosed  her 
unbroken  attachment  to  the  Catholic  faith :

to  my  cause.  I  beg  you,  therefore  to  do  all  in  your 
power  for  the  bearer,  agreeably  to  the  open  letter 
which  I  have  given  to  the  bearer,  and  to  continue  to 
him  his  usual  pension,  and  take  pains  to  gain  him,  for 
he  is  a  very  learned  young  man,  of  an  amiable  dis- 
position, and  related  to  many  worthy  persons.  I 
have  no  doubt,  if  he  could  but  be  sent  to  an  instructor 
who  is  a  Jesuit,  he  might  turn  Catholic;  and  to  thia 
end,  M.  de  Glascow,  take  care  to  send  a  supply  of 
money,  and  keep  up  a  communication  with  the  palace, 
and  act  as  a  faithful  servant  of  God  and  of  your 
country.  Take  care  of  our  country,  as  I  have  not 
means  of  doing  so,  and  be  assured  that  you  will  find 
in  me  a  kind  mistress  and  friend.  Solicit  all  the  am- 
bassadors and  my  relations  to  join  you  in  interceding 
for  me,  and  I  pray  God  to  grant  his  grace  to  you  and 
patience  to  me.  Ask  the  king  to  obtain  for  me  a 
confessor,  to  administer  the  sacraments,  in  case  God 
should  call  me  by  one  way  or  other. 

"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MARY  R." 

The  defenders  of  Mary  Stuart  in  Scotland  were  re- 
duced to  extremity,  and  Ilighford,  a  secretary  of  the 
Duke  of  Norfolk,  volunteered  to  transmit  money  and 
dispatches  to  Lord  Merries.  But  the  dispatches 
treacherously  reached  Cecil,  whom  Elizabeth  had 
created  Lord  Burghley.  Norfolk,  Ilighford,  and 
Barker  were  arrested.  Ilighford  revealed  the  whole 
conspiracy  minutely,  and  the  cipher  used  by  the 
duke  in  his  correspondence  concerning  Ridolfi's  mis- 
sion. Barker,  who  was  aged  and  feeble,  when  he  saw 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  301 

the  rack,  confessed,  and  confirmed  the  statements  of 
Highford.  Norfolk  was  now  hopelessly  involved  in 
treason.  After  an  attempt  at  denial,  he  was  over- 
whelmed with  the  testimony  of  his  friends,  and  ex- 
claimed, "  I  am  betrayed !  "  He  then  addressed  his 
humble  petitions  for  mercy  to  Elizabeth.  The 
alarmed  and  inflexible  Queen  resolved  to  make  him 
an  example  to  the  restless  nobles,  and  indicate  her 
royal  strength  and  policy  to  foreign  foes.  The  lords 
implicated  by  the  letters  were  arrested,  and  the  trial 
of  Norfolk  appointed.  January  14,  1572,  he  was 
summoned  before  a  jury  of  twenty-seven  peers,  in 
Westminster  Hall. 

"  The  duke  appeared  before  his  judges  with  all  the 
dignity  of  his  rank,  and  displayed  greater  firmness 
of  mind  than  he  had  previously  manifested.  He  was 
accused  of  having  conspired  to  deprive  the  Queen  of 
her  crown,  and  consequently,  of  life;  of  having 
sought  to  marry  Mary  Stuart,  (whom  he  had  termed 
an  adulteress  and  murderess,)  out  of  ambition,  that 
he  might  use  the  claims  she  possessed  to  procure  his 
own  accession  to  the  throne  of  England;  of  having 
aided  the  Queen's  enemies  in  Scotland ;  and  of  hav- 
ing plotted  on  the  Continent  with  the  Pope  and  the 
King  of  Spain,  to  change  the  religion,  and  overthrow 
the  government  of  England.  His  answer  to  these 
charges  was  skilful  and  plausible.  Admitting  all 
that  he  could  not  disprove,  he  confessed  that  he  had 
been  aware  of  matters  which  he  ought  not  to  have 
known,  but  to  which  he  had  never  been  willing  to  con- 
sent. Although  he  repudiated  indignantly  all 
thought  of  treason  against  the  Queen,  and  alleged  his 
inaction  as  a  proof  of  his  innocence,  he  was  unani- 


302  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

mnusly  found  guilty  by  his  peers,  and,  on  the  16th  of 
.January,  condemned  to  be  hanged,  drawn  and  quar- 
tered. On  hearing  his  sentence,  he  protested  that  he 
should  die  as  faithful  to  his  Queen  as  any  man  liv- 
ing ;  then  turning  to  his  judges,  he  said  with  emotion ; 
'  My  lords,  seeing  you  have  put  me  out  of  your  com- 
pany, I  trust  shortly  to  IK?  in  better  company.  I  will 
not  desire  any  of  you  all  to  make  any  petition  for  my 
life;  I  will  not  desire  to  live:  I  am  at  a  point.  Only 
I  beseech  you,  my  lords,  to  be  humble  suitors  to  the 
Queen's  majesty  for  my  poor  orphan  children,  that  it 
will  please  her  majesty  to  be  good  to  them,  and  to 
take  order  for  the  payment  of  my  debts,  and  some 
consideration  of  my  poor  servants.' 

"  On  his  return  to  the  Tower,  he  wrote  to  the 
Queen  a  letter  expressive  of  the  deepest  affliction  and 
the  most  heartfelt  repentance,  recommending  to  her 
generosity  his  children,  *  who/  he  said,  *  now  they 
have  neither  father  nor  mother,  will  find  but  few 
friends.'  He  did  not  cease  to  deplore  the  connection 
which  he  had  formed  with  the  Queen  of  Scotland, 
and,  in  bitter  truthfulness,  he  remarked,  '  that  noth- 
ing that  anybody  goeth  about  for  her,  nor  that  she 
doeth  for  herself  prospereth.'  ' 

Mary,  closely  confined  in  the  Castle  of  Sheffield, 
deprived  of  company  and  fresh  air,  sank  in  health 
and  spirits  under  this  fatal  blow  to  her  wild  and  soar- 
ing hopes.  Elizal&gt;eth  filled  to  the  brim  her  cup  of 
woe,  by  hurling  long  delayed  reproaches  upon  the 
captive ;  accusing  her  of  ungoverned  passions,  ingrat- 
itude, arid  the  ruin  of  Norfolk.  Mary  Stuart,  true  to 
her  ancestral  blood,  retorted,  with  bitter  charges  of 
deception  and  cruelty.  She  did  not  conceal  her  dis- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  303 

appointment  in  the  failure  of  the  conspiracy,  and  said 
"  she  determined  to  allow  herself  to  be  fed  with  hopes 
no  longer."  She  expressed  patience,  resignation  to 
God's  will,  and  courage  to  meet  death. 

She  affirmed  that  she  did  not  entertain  the  thought 
of  marrying  Norfolk  without  the  consent  of  the  coun- 
cil of  England,  and  added  respecting  him  and  other 
nobles,  "  that  she  should  think  herself  worthy  to  be 
universally  reputed  ungrateful,  and  of  bad  natural 
disposition,  if  she  did  not  employ  all  the  means  which 
God  had  left  her  in  this  world  to  mitigate  the  anger 
of  the  Queen  of  England  against  the  Duke  of  Nor- 
folk, and  the  other  nobles  who  had  got  into  trouble 
by  bearing  her  some  good  will,  and  if  she  did  not 
supplicate  her  good  sister  to  grant  them  her  peace,  or 
at  least  prevent  them  suffering  any  pain  on  her  ac- 
count." Elizabeth  vacillated  on  the  sentence  of  the 
duke's  execution.  Justice  impelled  her  to  sign  his 
death-warrant ;  then  the  remembrance  of  his  rela- 
tionship and  high  position  would  induce  her  to  re- 
voke it.  The  House  of  Commons,  in  which  the 
Puritans  had  the  ascendency,  meanwhile  demanded 
the  execution  of  Mary  Stuart ;  a  step  that  would  "  lay 
the  axe  at  the  root  of  the  evil."  Elizabeth  refused  to 
"  put  to  death  the  bird,  which,  to  escape  the  pursuit 
of  the  hawk,  had  fled  to  her  for  protection."  But  she 
no  longer  hesitated  as  to  the  fate  of  Norfolk.  May 
31st,  she  signed  the  fatal  warrant ;  and  at  8  o'clock  on 
the  morning  of  June  2d,  he  was  led  to  the  scaffold 
upon  Tower  Hill.  The  nobler  qualities  of  his  char- 
acter shone  forth  finely  beneath  the  gathering  shad- 
ows of  the  spirit-land.  His  calm  and  unshrinking 
approach  to  the  margin  of  dissolution  chained  the  at-

tention  of  all  spectators.  In  a  long  address,  he 
avowed  his  si  nor  re  devotion  to  the  Protestant  re- 
ligion; thanked  Mli/nlx'th  for  her  promised  kindness 
to  his  offspring;  and  conscious  of  his  own  ambitious 
aberrations  from  loyalty,  he  littered  these  words  of 
warning:  "  They  that  have  factions,  let  them  be- 
ware that  they  be  given  over  betimes.  Seek  not  to 
deviate  God's  doings,  lest  God  prevent  yours."  The 
people  were  affected  to  tears.  The  duke  then  offered 
earnest  prayer,  and  refusing  to  have  his  eyes  covered, 
serenely  laid  his  head  on  the  block.  The  descending 
axe  did  its  work,  and  the  troubled  bruin  of  the  con- 
spirator was  at  rest  forever!  Mary  Stuart's  cause  in 
England  also  expired  on  that  scaffold.  Insurrections 
and  plots  had  succeeded  each  other  in  dark  and  san- 
guinary colors.  Norfolk  resembled  Darnley  in  an 
indecision  which  ruined  his  most  promising  plans, 
but  in  everything  else,  was  vastly  the  superior  of  the 
murdered  King.  Francis  II.,  Chatelard,  the  mad 
lover,  Bothwell,  and  Norfolk,  had  left  Mary's  side, 
and  still  she  lived,  weak  in  frame  and  strong  in  am- 
bition. 

Manifold  and  oppressive  must  have  been  the  recol- 
lections that  thronged  the  mind  of  the  illustrious 
captive  in  her  lonely  apartments!  The  gay  dreams 
of  a  French  court,  the  scenes  of  festivity  and  violence 
in  Scotland's  capital,  the  excitements  of  misplaced 
and  lawless  affection,  lay  in  the  past;  while  the  black- 
ness of  despair  hung  menacingly  on  the  future.  Un- 
fortunte  Queen,  whose  beauty  was  the  rainbow  upon 
the  bosom  of  a  perpetual  storm ! 


CHAPTER  VIII. 

THE  Earl  of  Lennox  had  been  shot  by  Mary's  par- 
tisans, and  the  Earl  of  Mar  unanimously  appointed 
his  successor,  at  a  meeting  of  the  King's  nobles  the 
next  day.  Unable  to  crush  the  faction  of  Mary 
Stuart,  Elizabeth  effected  a  truce  between  the  hostile 
armies.  A  treaty  with  France  calmed  her  fears  of 
trouble  with  Charles  IX.,  when  suddenly,  as  a  falling 
thunderbolt,  came  the  tidings  of  the  merciless  butch- 
ery of  St.  Bartholomew.  A  shriek  of  horror  rose 
from  Protestant  England.  The  Queen  assembled  her 
council,  and  denied  for  some  days  audience  to  the 
French  ambassador.  When  she  relented,  and  con- 
sented to  see  him,  she  appeared  with  the  ladies  of  her 
court,  dressed  in  deep  mourning.  A  sepulchral  si- 
lence pervaded  the  apartment,  and  sealed  every  lip. 
While  Fenelon*  passed  through  the  crowd,  the  eyes  of 
the  courtiers  fell,  and  not  a  smile  illumined  his  ad- 
vance toward  the  haughty  and  solemn  sovereign. 
She  expressed  her  sad  surprise  at  the  permission  of 
his  King  to  that  Papal  slaughter  of  Protestants,  and 
her  apprehension  of  betrayal,  notwithstanding  the 
treaty.  She  immediately  fortified  Dover  and  the  Isle 
of  Wight,  levied  troops,  and  made  preparations  for 
invincible  self-defence. 

*  When  Charles  IX.  directed  Fenelon  to  apologize  to  Queen 
Elizabeth  for  that  dreadful  massacre,  he  replied,  "Sire,  ad- 
dress yourself  to  those  who  advised  you  to  do  it."

r,i  if,  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Mary  Stuart  became  an  object  of  increasing  solici- 
tude and  vigilance.  She  was  the  star  of  Catholic 
empire  in  Scotland  and  England.  Elizabeth  de- 
termined, as  her  only  security,  to  keep  her  captive 
in  perpetual  imprisonment.  Divines  and  jurists 
united  in  proving  Mary  worthy  of  death,  and  both 
houses  of  Parliament  desired  to  bring  in  a  bill  of  at- 
'  tainder,  which  the  Queen,  to  her  honor,  rejected. 
Mary  was  again  visited  by  English  lords,  and  ques- 
tioned upon  the  charges  preferred  against  her.  She 
denied  any  designed  hostility  to  Elizabeth,  in  the  pro- 
posed alliance  with  Norfolk,  and  affirmed  that  Rid«&gt;l- 
fi's  embassy  aimed  only  at  the  deliverance  of  Scot- 
land, and  her  relations  to  Philip  II.  and  Pius  IX. 
The  Queen  of  England  disregarded  the  explanations, 
and  entered  upon  an  experiment  similar  to  that  often 
repeated  vainly  in  Mary's  experience. 

A  plan  was  secretly  laid  to  strengthen  Protestant- 
ism in  Scotland,  by  harmonizing  antagonistic  lead- 
en, and  delivering  the  royal  prisoner  to  them  for  exe- 
cution, upon  their  urgent  solicitation.  Sir  Henry 
Killigrew,  brother-in-law  of  Cecil,  (Lord  Burghley,) 
left  England  on  this  mission,  September  7th,  in  the 
fever  of  excitement  which  followed  the  intelligence  of 
the  Parisian  tragedy.  John  Knox  was  in  Edin- 
burgh, smitten  with  apoplexy,  and  evidently  near 
death.  The  deliberate  murder  of  seventy  thousand 
Protestants,  among  them  distinguished  friends, 
roused  the  wasting  energies  of  the  great  Reformer. 
He  was  carried  to  the  church,  and  mounting  his  pul- 
pit, poured  forth  a  torrent  of  eloquent  execration  on 
the  slayers  of  his  brethren.  His  influence  aided  the 
cause  of  Killigrew.  The  Earls  Morton  and  Mar  ae- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  307 

cepted  the  proposition  of  Elizabeth  on  these  condi- 
tions : 

"  That  the  Queen  of  England  should  take  their 
young  King  under  her  protection:  that  his  rights 
should  not  be  invalidated  by  any  sentence  which 
might  be  passed  upon  his  mother,  and  that  they 
should  be  maintained  by  a  declaration  of  the  English 
Parliament:  that  a  defensive  alliance  should  be  es- 
tablished between  the  two  kingdoms :  that  the  Earls  of 
Huntingdon,  Bedford  or  Essex,  should  be  present  at 
Mary's  execution  with  two  or  three  thousand  men, 
and  should  afterwards  assist  the  troops  of  the  young 
King  to  reduce  the  city  of  Edinburgh:  and  finally, 
that  that  fortress  should  be  placed  in  the  regent's 
hands,  and  that  England  should  pay  all  the  arrears 
due  to  the  Scottish  troops." 

The  extravagant  terms  of  the  noblemen,  with  the 
sudden  death  of  the  regent,  defeated  the  scheme. 
November  24th,  Morton  was  elected  to  the  regency 
of  Scotland.  Upon  that  same  day  in  Edinburgh, 
John  Knox  was  calmly  waiting  for  his  departure 
from  earth.  He  had  given  to  the  session  of  his 
church  a  dying  charge  of  great  eloquence  and  power, 
which  deeply  impressed  the  minds  of  the  reverent 
spectators.  With  a  kindling  e^ye  and  difficult  breath- 
ing, he  said,  in  vindication  of  his  ministerial  career : 

"  The  day  approaches,  and  is  now  before  the  door, 
for  which  I  have  frequently  and  vehemently  thirsted, 
when  I  shall  be  released  from  my  great  labors  and  in- 
numerable sorrows,  and  shall  be  with  Christ.  And 
now,  God  is  my  witness,  whom  I  have  served  in  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

spirit,  in  the  gospel  of  his  Son,  that  I  have  taught 
nothing  but  the  true  and  solid  doctrine  of  the  gospel 
of  the  Son  of  God,  and  have  had  it  for  my  only  object 
to  instruct  the  ignorant,  to  confirm  the  faithful,  to 
comfort  tin-  weak,  the  fearful,  and  the  distressed,  by 
the  promises  of  grace,  and  t&lt;&gt;  tiirht  against  the  proud 
and  rebellious  by  the  divine  threatenings.  I  know 
that  many  have  frequently  complained,  and  do  still 
loudly  complain,  of  my  too  great  severity;  but  ('•&lt;"! 
knows  that  my  mind  was  always  void  of  hatred  to  tin- 
persons  of  those  against  whom  I  thundered  the  sever- 
est judgments.  I  cannot  deny  that  I  felt  the  greatest 
abhorrence  at  the  sins  in  which  they  indulged,  but 
still,  I  kept  this  one  thing  in  view,  that,  if  possible, 
I  might  gain  them  to  the  Lord.  What  influenced  me 
to  utter  whatever  the  Lord  put  into  my  mouth,  so 
boldly,  and  without  respect  of  persons,  was  a  rev- 
erential fear  of  my  God,  who  called  and  of  his  grace 
appointed  me  to  be  a  steward  of  divine  mysteries,  and 
a  belief  that  he  will  demand  an  account  of  the  man- 
ner in  which  I  have  discharged  the  trust  committed 
to  me,  when  I  shall  stand  at  last  before  his  tribunal. 
I  profess,  therefore,  before  God,  and  before  his  holy 
anirels,  that  I  never  made  merchandize  of  the  sacred 
word  of  God,  never  studied  to  please  men,  never  in- 
dulged my  own  private  passions  or  those  of  others, 
but  faithfully  distributed  the  talents  entmsted  to  me 
for  the  edification  of  the  church  over  which  I 
watched.  Whatever  obloquy  wicked  men  may  cast 
on  mi-  respecting  this  point,  I  rejoice  in  the  testimony 
of  a  good  conscience.  In  the  mean  time,  my  dear 
brethren,  do  you  persevere  in  the  eternal  truth  of  the 
gospel:  wait  diligently  on  the  flock  over  which  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  309 

Lord  hath  set  you,  and  which  he  redeemed  with  the 
blood  of  his  only  begotten  Son.  And  thou,  my  dear- 
est brother  Lawson,  fight  the  good  fight,  and  do  the 
work  of  the  Lord  joyfully  and  resolutely.  The  Lord 
from  on  high  bless  you,  and  the  whole  church  of  Edin- 
burgh, against  whom,  as  long  as  they  persevere  in  the 
word  of  truth  which  they  have  heard  of  me,  the  gates 
of  hell  shall  not  prevail." 

Beside  his  wife,  Bannatyne,  Campbell  of  Kinyean- 
cleuch,  and  Johnston  of  Elphingston,  and  Dr.  Pres- 
ton, his  intimate  friends,  watched  in  turn  at  his  bed- 
side. Campbell  inquired  if  he  were  in  pain.  "  It  is 
no  painful  pain,  but  such  a  pain  as  shall  soon,  I  trust, 
put  an  end  to  the  battle.  I  must  leave  the  care  of 
my  wife  and  children  to  you,  to  whom  you  must  be 
husband  in  my  room."  Soon  after,  his  vision  began 
to  fail,  and  he  desired  his  wife  to  read  the  15th  chap- 
ter of  first  Corinthians.  He  listened  devoutly  to  the 
message  of  God,  and  then  exclaimed,  "  Is  not  that  a 
comfortable  chapter '?  O  what  sweet  and  salutary 
consolation  the  Lord  has  afforded  me  from  that  chap- 
ter !  "  A  few  moments  later  he  said,  "  Now  for  the 
last  time  I  commend  my  soul,  spirit  and  body,  (touch- 
ing three  of  his  fingers,)  into  thy  hand,  O  Lord!  " 
'  Lingering  longer  than  he  expected,  he  added  to  his 
wife,  "  Go  read  where  I  cast  my  first  anchor ;  "  mean- 
ing the  17th  chapter  of  St.  John.  After  a  terrible 
spiritual  conflict,  he  replied  to  the  inquiry,  if  he 
heard  the  prayers  offered  in  his  behalf:  "  Would  to 
God  that  you  and  all  men  had  heard  them  as  I  have 
heard  them ;  I  praise  God  for  that  heavenly  sound." 
About  eleven  o'clock  at  night,  he  sighed  heavily,  and 
said,  "  Now  it  is  come !  "  He  was  speechless ;  but

when  desired  to  give  a  sign  of  peace,  he  raised  both 
hands,  and  expired  as  placidly  as  an  infant  falling 
asleep.  He  was  nearly  sixty-seven*;  less  worn  with 
age  than  with  conflicts  and  trials,  whose  field  of  bat- 
tle and  storm  is  the  immortality  within.  He  had 
bared  his  breast  before  the  enemies  of  his  beloved 
church  and  native  land.  The  skeptical  sneer  of  par- 
tial historians  falls  powerless  on  the  death-scene  of 
such  a  man.  Gifted  and  heroic,  sometimes  bold  to  a 
fault,  he  was  beloved  by  the  pious  burghers,  respected 
by  the  nobility,  and  universally  lamented  by  the 
Presbyterian  church.  He  discovered  before  his 
death,  the  coming  complete  triumph  of  the  Protestant 
faith,  under  the  energetic  Morton. 

The  Castle  of  Edinburgh,  after  an  obstinate  and 
brave  resistance,  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  besiegers, 
May  31st;  and  the  last  fortress  of  Mary's  disheart- 
ened troops  was  a  scathed  and  battered  citadel,  with- 
in whose  walls  were  only  suppliants  for  mercy.  Not- 
withstanding much  earnest  interposition  to  save  them, 
the  Laird  of  Grange  and  his  brother,  Sir  James  Kir- 
kaldy,  were  led  to  the  scuffold  at  the  Cross  of  Edin- 
burgh, August  3d,  1573.  They  died  loyal  to  Mary 

*  John  Knox,  the  leader  of  Protestantism  in  Scotland,  was 
born  in  Haddington  in  the  year  1505 — the  month  and  day  of 
his  birth  not  being  known — and  died  in  Edinburgh  November 
24,  1572.  Froude  justly  says  that  he  was  "  perhaps  in  that  ex- 
traordinary age  its  most  extraordinary  man,  and  his  charac- 
ter became  the  mold  in  whi-  h  the  later  fortunes  of  his  coun- 
try were  cast."  Again  :  "  He  was  the  one  antagonist  whom 
Mary  could  not  soften  nor  Mnitland  deceive ;  he  it  was  who 
raised  the  poor  commons  of  his  country  into  a  stern  and 
rugged  people  .  .  .  men  whom  neither  king,  noble,  nor  priest 
could  force  again  to  submit  to  tyranny."

Stuart,  and  with  the  unshrinking  courage  of  a  sin- 
cere persuasion  of  past  well-doing.  With  those 
strong  adherents  was  lost  hopelessly  the  cause  of 
Mary  Stuart  in  Scotland.  She  yielded  to  the  fury 
of  the  tempest,  and  was  the  victim  of  extreme  depres- 
sion. Since  St.  Bartholomew's  day,  she  had  suffered 
the  severities  of  close  captivity;  forbidden  corre- 
spondence and  the  visits  of  friends.  Now  that  her 
faction  was  annihilated,  more  liberty  was  permitted. 
And  she  turned  her  thoughts  to  an  altered  tone  of 
pleading  with  Elizabeth.  With  submissive  air,  she 
sought  to  gain  by  direct  means  what  she  had  at- 
tempted by  force  and  stratagem.  She  wrote,  at  this 
period,  the  following  letter : 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  QUEEN  ELIZABETH. 

"  Madam,  my  good  sister — I  consider  myself  very 
unfortunate  in  having  found,  in  my  adversity,  so 
many  persons  ready  to  injure  me  by  all  sorts  of 
means,  and  wrongfully;  for  I  have  not,  that  I  know 
of,  ever  done  anything  to  deserve  their  displeasure. 
Yet,  they  are  every  day  making  some  fresh  report  to 
you,  in  order  to  make  you  suspicious  of,  and  angry 
with  me,  even  at  the  moment  when  I  am  most  anx- 
ious to  avoid  the  least  occasion  of  giving  you  offence. 
I  state  this,  because,  ever  since  you  were  pleased  to 
send  to  me  Mr.  Wade,  and  other  commissioners,  who 
informed  me  of  part  of  your  anger  against  me,  I  have 
endeavored  not  to  speak,  to  write,  or  even  to  think 
of  anything  that  I  could  suppose  likely  to  give  you 
any  cause  whatever  to  be  displeased  with  me. 

"  Thus,  when  I  heard  of  the  loss  of  my  Castle  of 


312  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Edinburgh,  ami  other  reverses,  perceiving  that  peo- 
ple took  pleasure  in  talking  more  about  them  than 
was  necessary  for  comforting  me,  I  flatly  refused  to 
converse  upon  that  subject,  not  wishing  to  make  my 
misfortunes  a  pastime  to  any  one,  and  not  being  able 
to  remedy  them ;  and  also  expressly  not  to  furnish 
occasion  to  any  «&gt;iie  to  put  a  malicious  construction 
on  my  words;  and  yet  you  daily  heard  some  false 
report  concerning  me,  as  I  perceive  from  the  letters 
of  De  la  Mothe  Fenelon,  ambassador  of  the  King,  my 
good  brother.  But  if  you  would  have  the  kindness 
to  reserve  an  ear  for  me,  before  condemning  me  on 
the  faith  of  those  who,  by  such  reports,  strive  to  in- 
cense you  against  me,  you  would  soon  find  that  they 
have  no  other  foundation  for  their  statements  than  a 
malicious  desire  to  injure  me. 

"  You  have  been  informed  that  I  had  attempted  t&lt;» 
bribe  your  subjects  with  my  money;  but  if  you  will 
please  to  inquire,  you  will  find  it  a  mere  supp'-ition, 
and  that,  as  I  have  already  remarked,  in  writing  to 
the  said  Sr.  de  la  Mothe  Fenelon,  I  have  too  many 
urgent  calls  upon  the  income  I  receive,  to  be  able 
to  bring  more  money  hither  than  what  is  absolutely 
necessary  to  pay  my  servants,  and  provide  for  my 
wants.  If  it  had  been  agreeable  to  you,  you  might 
have  seen  this  from  the  account  which  I  have  kept 
of  my  moneys,  of  which  I  have  reserved  but  a  very 
small  sum  for  the  above  purpose. 

"  For  the  rest,  it  appears  unfortunate  for  my  af- 
fairs that  I  have  gained  so  many  friends, seeing  the  ill 
turns  that  are  done  me  on  all  sides;  and,  though  it  i&lt; 
asserted  that  I  complain  of  being  watched  too  closely, 
and  that  I  am,  nevertheless,  continually  gaining  per- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  313 

sons  to  my  side,  I  assure  you,  madam,  that  I  neither 
see  nor  speak  to  any  creature  in  the  world,  with  the 
exception  of  those  under  whose  charge  you  have 
'placed  me,  and  that  with  as  much  reserve  as  possible; 
for,  as  for  any  complaint  or  remonstrance  that  I  have 
made  to  them,  God  knows  that  they  have  not  obliged 
my  by  any  remedy  they  have  applied ;  and  even  when 
they  have  granted  me  anything,  at  the  request  of  the 
said  Sr.  de  la  Mothe  Fenelon,  it  has  always  been  so 
thwarted  that  I  have  been  no  better  for  it.  I  do  not 
say  this  to  complain  of  any  one,  for  I  have  learned  to 
suffer,  since  it  is  your  pleasure,  and  I  shall  never  at- 
tribute to  any  but  you  the  good  or  evil  that  befalls 
me  in  this  country,  having  come  and  placed  myself 
in  your  hands,  as  being  my  surest  refuge,  for  the 
honor  I  have  to  be  your  nearest  kinswoman  and  neigh- 
bor, and  have  no  right  to  do  otherwise  than  you  com- 
mand ;  and  I  should  be  very  simple,  having  lived  so 
long  in  trouble,  if  I  did  or  said,  in  any  house  in  Eng- 
land, what  I  wished  not  to  be  referred  to  you  and  to 
your  council,  were  my  affection  other  than  it  is  to- 
ward you,  seeing  that  I  have  access  to  none  but  those 
whom  I  know  to  be  charged  to  watch  me.  I  suf- 
fered too  severely  at  Bourton — recollect,  if  you 
please,  the  charity  that  was  done  me  there — not  to 
be  on  my  guard  elsewhere,  though  I  may  not  appear 
to  be  so. 

"  But  to  conclude,  I  feel  my  conscience  so  clear, 
that  whatever  reports  may  be  made  of  my  actions, 
provided  people  only  adhere  to  the  truth,  I  will  give 
you  no  cause  to  be  dissatisfied  with  me,  and  I  there- 
fore beseech  you  not  to  believe  anything  that  may  be 
told  you  to  the  contrary ;  for,  I  assure  you,  that  I  have 


.T14  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

neither  written  nor  said  more  than  1  have  said  to  your 
commissioners,  or  written  to  yourself,  and  in  proof 
of  my  innocence  in  something,  if  you  should  be 
pleased  to  adopt  some  good  expedient,  that  with  your 
favor  I  might  go  to  France  or  Scotland,  things  being 
by  you  reestablished  for  my  honor  and  safety,  you 
will  find  that  I  should  feel  myself  greatly  obliged  to 
you,  and  I  will  gladly  prepare  to  quit  this  country, 
that  I  may  manifest  elsewhere,  when  at  liberty,  my 
affection  to  you,  which  people  strive  to  disguise  from 
you,  to  deprive  me  of  the  opportunity  of  defending 
myself  in  your  presence,  in  which  the  others  have 
time  and  place  to  accuse  me.  Be  this  as  it  may,  I 
beseech  you  in  future  to  believe  nothing  concerning 
me,  and  not  to  credit  or  hearken  to  anything  against 
me,  but  what  you  have  sufficient  proof  of;  for  I  de- 
sire nothing  more  than  to  do  what  is  agreeable  to  you, 
if  you  will  be  pleased  to  grant  me  the  means,  and 
permit  me  to  have  access  to  you,  that  I  may  lay  be- 
fore you  my  grievances  ;  for,  till  that  moment,  I  shall 
experience  nothing  but  crosses:  and  fearing  that  I 
have  already  fatigued  you  by  this  long  letter,  I  will 
send  the  rest  of  my  remonstrances  to  Monsieur  de  la 
Mothe  Fenelon,  and  present  my  humble  recommenda- 
tions to  your  good  favor,  praying  God  to  grant  you, 
madam,  good  health  and  a  long  and  very  happy  lifo. 
From  the  Castle  of  Chffeild,  th«  20  February,  1574. 
"  Your  very  affectionate  and  good  sister  and  cousin,' 


Elizabeth,  in  return,  allowed  her  to  extend  her 
walks  into  the  park  and  gardens  of  Sheffield.  The 
humid  air  of  her  prison  had  induced  rheumatism  in 


MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS.  315 

her  arms,  and  she  was  wasted  with  a  liver-complaint, 
whose  symptoms  were  aggravated  by  her  incarcera- 
tion. According  to  her  request,  she  was  therefore 
permitted  to  visit  the  baths  of  Buxton,  not  far  from 
Sheffield;  where  she  relinquished  conspiracies  and 
dangerous  correspondence,  for  harmless  amusements. 
She  wrote  to  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow  two  or  three 
letters,  which  display  her  business  forethought  and 
new  employments : 

THE  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS  TO  THE  ARCHBISHOP  OF  GLAS- 
GOW. 

"  May,  1574. 

"  Monsieur  de  Glascow — None  of  my  subjects  or 
servants  has  a  greater  dislike  to  enter  into  disputes 
than  myself ;  yet  I  would  do  so  both  with  the  one  and 
the  other,  when  I  love  them  and  wish  to  make  use  of 
them,  communicating  my  will  and  what  I  think  it 
necessary  for  them  to  know,  in  order  to  dispose  them 
to  fulfill  it  voluntarily ;  on  the  other  hand,  as  far  as 
lies  in  my  power,  and  I  see  that  it  is  reasonable,  I 
shall  have  great  pleasure  in  gratifying  them  when 
they  solicit  emolument,  honor,  and  advancement  of 
me.  As  I  perceive  from  your  letters  that  you  are 
mistaken  in  regard  to  my  last,  which  you  think  too 
harsh,  this  makes  me  write  to  you  in  the  style  of  a 
mistress,  'purposely  that  you  may  not  doubt  that  all 
they  contained  was  according  to  my  command ;  for  I 
never  write  letters  that  others  dictate.  They  may, 
indeed,  prepare  them,  but  I  look  over  and  correct 
them  if  they  convey  not  my  meaning,  before  I  sign 
them.  You  cannot  harbor  this  doubt  in  the  present 


run  MAUY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

instance,  for  my  secn-tjiry  is  so  ill  that  I  am 
to  write  all  my  dispatches  with  my  own  hand ;  but  I 
am  of  the  same  opinion  as  he  who  writes  for  you, 
whom  you  will  command  to  write  in  milder  terms  an- 
other time,  for  I  do  not  wish  to  be  compelled  to  write 
to  you  otherwise  than  as  befitting  so  faithful  a  sub- 
ject, and  a  minister  diligent  and  zealous  in  obeying 
the  commands  of  a  good  mistress,  and  to  remove  all 
occasion  for  doubt  or  ignorance,  or  discontent,  which 
I  suspect  some  persons  are  striving  to  put  into  your 
head,  knowing  that  I  would  not  take  the  same  trouble 
to  satisfy  them  as  for  you,  whose  services  are  so  val- 
uable to  me. 

"  I  will  tell  you  what  both  your  brothers  told  me 
to  write  to  you,  and  I  assure  you,  without  meaning  to 
offend  you — that  you  may  believe  this  on  the  word 
of  her  whose  testimony  alone  ought  to  be  positive 
proof — I  have  still  some  of  your  letters  which  I  re- 
ceived at  Winkfield  and  other  places,  in  which  you 
informed  me  that  M.  the  cardinal  had  placed  the  seals 
in  your  hands  until  I  should  appoint  a  chancellor, 
and  that  you  would  use  such  authority  in  the  best 
manner  you  possibly  could  to  my  advantage,  hoping 
that,  whoever  succeeded  you,  he  would  find  his  road 
already  marked  out.  You,  at  the  same  time,  recom- 
mended to  me  a  brother-in-law,  or  some  other  rela- 
tion of  the  treasurer's,  and  Duvergier.  I  appointed 
Duvergier  on  this  condition;  that  he  should  reside  in 
Paris,  and  come  over  here  to  receive  my  orders;  for  I 
should  have  been  vexed  had  it  l&gt;een  given  to  any  one 
without  my  knowledge,  as  I  formerly  wrote  to  you. 
In  short,  you  never  expressed  a  wish  to  me  to  keep 
the  seals  for  any  time,  or  led  me  to  suppose  you  would 


MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS.      317 

feel  gratified  by  having  them  given  to  you;  and 
surely,  during  the  two  years  which  elapsed  between 
my  gift,  or  at  least  the  promise  by  letter  written  with 
my  own  hand  to  Duvergier,  and  his  entering  into  of- 
fice, you  had  sufficient  time  to  let  me  know  if  you 
wished  for  the  appointment  or  not ;  for  I  assure  you 
that  I  should  have  preferred  you,  had  you  frankly 
asked  me  for  it;  but  naturally  supposing  that  you 
would  have  expressed  your  wish  to  that  effect,  if  you 
had  formed  any,  I  did,  as  I  always  told  you  it  was 
my  intention  to  do,  appoint  a  chancellor,  and  I  am 
sorry  you  should  have  so  long  deferred  informing  me 
of  your  dissatisfaction,  for  which  there  is  no  remedy. 
"  As  to  what  you  tell  me  that  I  am  censured  for  it, 
inform  me  who  and  what,  for  it  is  your  duty,  and  not 
to  suffer  anything  to  be  said  in  your  presence  out  of 
pique  or  caprice  against  me,  and  I  will  let  them  know 
what  I  think  of  it.  They  are  not  very  discreet  who 
wilfully  intermeddle,  and  try  to  sow  discord  between 
an  old  experienced  minister  and  his  mistress,  who 
ought  to  understand  matters  better  than  they  do, 
clever  as  they  conceive  themselves  to  be.  Tell  them 
that,  whenever  I  shall  look  after  them,  their  bad  con- 
duct will  be  discovered ;  that  you  will  be  the  first  to 
expose  it,  and  then  each  must  answer  for  himself. 
As  for  yourself,  you  say  that  you  have  no  fear  of  be- 
ing made  a  slave,  but  are  determined  to  follow  my  di- 
rections in  everything,  by  which  you  shall  not  lose 
either  profit,  honor,  or  advancement;  for  you  shall 
be  preferred  to  every  one  whatsoever ;  and  in  future, 
whenever  you  have  any  desire  for  an  appointment  or 
other  favor,  be  not  afraid  to  let  me  know  it,  for 
neither  you  nor  any  other  person  shall  ever  have  any- 


318  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

thing  in  my  gift  but  from  myself,  if  I  can  help  it; 
but,  if  you  are  presented  with  anything  from  another 
quarter,  as  I  have  so  often  solicited,  I  shall  consider 
myself  greatly  obliged.  As  far  as  I  can  see,  the  ap- 
pointment would  only  have  annoyed  you,  for  you 
\\"iil'l  have  gained  nothing  but  ill-will,  if  you  had 
said  absolutely  that  you  would  follow  my  instruc- 
tions as  punctually  as  I  wish;  for  people  over  there 
like  to  do  only  just  what  they  please.  If  I  could  but 
speak  to  you,  I  would  soon  remove  any  unpleasant 
impression  by  explaining  the  cause  of  my  dissatisfac- 
tion, which  in  no  way  concerns  you ;  nor  in  my  choice 
of  chancellor  has  any  person  a  right  to  find  fault  with 
me,  or  to  accuse  me  of  monopoly,  as  you  say;  but  I 
hate  those  whom  persons  over  there  would  wish  to  ap- 
point, though  no  one  was  officious  enough  to  propose 
or  to  persuade  me  otherwise  than  what  I  have  already 
written  to  you,  which  I  shall  not  repeat — and  this  is 
the  truth. 

"  I  have  been  informed  that,  as  soon  as  the  news 
was  known  that  Duvergier  had  a  passport  to  come  to 
me,  it  was  said  in  your  lodging  that  Roullet  had  ob- 
tained it  from  him ;  wherein  he  was  unjustly  sus- 
]&gt;octed,  for  the  poor  fellow  never  opened  his  mouth  to 
speak  to  me  concerning  it,  and  would  have  been  glad 
to  make  the  journey  himself,  if  possible,  feeling  him- 
self already  attacked  by  that  disorder  which  has  since 
reduced  him  to  his  present  state.  In  short,  it  was  my 
own  act  and  deed ;  but  as  he  is  so  odious  to  you,  that 
you  have  refused  to  introduce  him,  as  I  requested,  I 
will  not  urge  you  further.  At  all  events,  he  will  not 
fail  to  side  with  yon  as  I  have  commanded  him,  and 
to  take  your  advice  whenever  you  choose  to  give  it. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  319 

I  never  intended  that  lie  should  be  either  your  su- 
perior or  equal  in  the  council,  where,  in  the  absence 
of  my  uncle,  the  Cardinal  of  Lorraine,  you,  as  my 
representative,  hold  the  first  place,  and  where  you 
are  invested  with  authority  to  see  to  it  that  my  affairs 
are  conducted  according  to  my  orders,  which  I  am 
certain  you  will  implicitly  follow,  by  way  of  setting 
a  good  example,  more  especially  as  you  are  my  nat- 
ural subject.  I  beg,  therefore,  that  henceforth  I  may 
not  again  see  any  expressions  in  your  letters  which 
savor  of  dispute  and  altercation,  nor  hear  any  more 
about  the  dissatisfaction  and  disgust  which  prevent 
you  from  fulfilling  the  duties  that  you  are  charged 
with,  as  my  present  situation  requires.  For  the  rest, 
if  there  are  any  who  murmur  at  my  orders,  tell  them 
that  at  the  present  moment,  what  I  most  desire  in  my 
affairs  is,  to  know  those  who  are  disposed  to  obey  me, 
that  I  may  employ  them,  with  the  assured  intention 
of  rewarding  them ;  and  those  who  would  fain  man- 
age my  affairs  according  to  their  own  fancy,  that  they 
must  change  their  conduct,  or  I  shall  persuade  myself 
that  it  is  not  so  much  for  my  interest  as  for  their  own, 
that  they  wish  to  serve  me.  I  want  to  see  if,  because 
I  am  absent  or  in  prison,  my  orders  are  to  be  slighted 
or  not,  and  I  am  willing  to  listen  to  the  opinions  of 
each,  in  order  to  follow  the  best  counsel,  which  God 
will  give  me  grace  to  discern;  but  wherever  I  find 
any  confederacy  formed  to  counteract  my  intentions, 

shall  hold  as  suspicious  all  those  who  belong  to  it, 
and  only  employ  such  as  pursue  a  different  course. 

"  I  have  made  a  declaration  of  my  intentions,  in 
answer  to  the  replies  made  me  to  the  instructions  and 
estimates  which  I  gave  to  my  chancellor,  I  send  it 


320  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

you  for  the  purpose  of  showing  and  making  it  known, 
as  herein  expressed;  this  I  beg  you  to  do,  and  to  con- 
form to  my  wish,  which,  if  I  could  cnmumnic:ite  to 
you  in  any  other  way  than  ojH-nly,  you  would  approve 
«&gt;f  it,  nnd  ho  convinced,  a-  I  l»cfore  told  you,  that 
nothing  was  done  with  the  intention  of  disparaging 
your  faithful  and  agreeable  services.  I  would  most 
willingly  have  sought  to  procure  permission  for  you 
to  come  over,  had  I  not  proof  that  it  would  be  de- 
nied me,  and  were  not  all  my  requests  viewed  with 
more  and  nn&gt;re  suspicion.  I  will,  however,  do  all  I 
can,  and  I  beg  you  will  do  tli»-  same  on  your  part. 
A-  for  the  money  which  you  delivered  to  the  Kngli&gt;!i 
ambassador,  take  care  and  make  him  return  it,  and 
never  again  place  any  more  in  his  hands,  nor  any- 
thing else,  for  they  will  not  be  answerable  for  any- 
thing. If  my  servants  are  urgent  for  their  wages,  I 
shall  l&gt;e  reduced  to  great  straits.  I  shall  soon  send  a 
memorandum  of  those  I  wish  to  be  paid,  the  same  as 
they  were  entered  in  my  estimate.  Look  to  this,  and 
take  care  that  the  assignations,  which  I  sent  by  Du- 
vergier,  for  wages  and  gifts  to  my  servants  here  with 
me,  be  immediately  dispatched  by  the  treasurer  be- 
fore anything  else;  for  until  this  be  done,  I  will  not 
cither  give  to  or  recompense  any  other,  excepting  the 
person  to  whom  the  Bishop  of  Ross  lent  a  hundred 
crowns.  I  am  very  sorry  that  they  have  not  been  bet- 
ter satisfied,  and  without  my  knowledge.  If  you  d&lt; 
anything  for  them,  I  will  most  willingly  allow  for  it 
rather  than  remain  indebted  to  them  as  I  am.  I 
recommend  also  to  you  old  Curie;  he  is  an  old  and 
faithful  servant,  and  his  son  is  faithful  and  diligent 
in  my  service.  I  have  assigned  him  some  money,  to 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  321 

be  employed  in  the  way  that  he  knows  of.  See  to  it 
that  he  is  promptly  paid ;  and,  if  opportunity  offers 
of  providing  for  any  of  his  children,  you  will  do  me 
a  great  kindness  by  seeking  the  means.  But  that  I 
may  have  an  answer  to  this  dispatch  how  my  servants 
will  be  paid,  I  will  send  a  list  of  those  whom  I  wish 
to  be  paid  first  in  France,  among  whom  I  shall  not 
forget  your  servants,  particularly  the  good  old  man 
Warkar,  whom  I  have  known  for  a  very  long  time. 
My  ecuyer  de  cuisine  [head  cook]  ;  notwithstanding 
all  the  orders  I  had  given  him,  has  not  been  able  to 
get  any  money.  I  beg  you,  more  especially  as  I  have 
recommended,  for  my  own  safety,  to  be  cautious  in 
regard  to  my  victuals,  to  let  this  be  immediately  set- 
tled ;  and  tell  Hoteman  to  receive  his  wages,  and  keep 
them  for  my  sake ;  and  speak  to  Cheminon,  and  in- 
quire if  there  be  any  means  of  assisting  him  to  re- 
cover part  of  his  money,  which  was  received  but 
mismanaged,  otherwise  it  will  be  necessary  for  him 
to  go  over  himself,  which  he  has  already  asked  leave 
of  me  to  do ;  and  I  assure  you  I  should  miss  him  very 
much.  I  am  not  out  of  danger  if  my  food  is  not 
closely  watched,  and  he  is  the  only  person  here  who 
has  the  care  of  it ;  besides,  as  I  have  no  apothecary, 
he  makes  up  all  the  medicines  for  me  and  my  house- 
hold; and  I  have  not  been  very  ill  since  last  Lent, 
when  I  suffered  a  good  deal  from  the  cold  and  want 
of  exercise. 

"  Roullet  has  sent  me  a  letter  from  Monsieur  de 
Flavignv,  which  I  have  read ;  but,  as  the  said  Roullet 
cannot  answer  him,  I  beg  you  to  make  my  recom- 
mendations to  him,  and  to  assure  him  that  if  ever  I 
have  the  luck  to  recover  my  liberty,  I  shall  remind

him  of  his  promise  to  be  a  courtier,  at  least  in  my 
company,  where  he  will  always  be  wished  for  and  wel- 
come, as  his  virtues  and  amiable  disposition  deserve. 
I  recommend  to  you  my  two  orphans,  Annibal  and 
William  Douglas,  as  you  would  wish  me  to  do  for 
those  in  whom  you  are  interested.  I  am  writing  for 
some  articles  which  I  want ;  order  them  to  be  for- 
warded to  me  as  soon  as  possible,  and  money  for 
my  household.  I  am  also  writing  to  monsieur,  my 
brother-in-law;  to  the  Queens  mesdames,  my  good 
mother  and  my  sister;  to  Monsieur  Ic  Due,  and  Mon- 
sieur de  Montmorency;  deliver  my  letters  to  them, 
and  speak  to  them  in  behalf  of  Adam  Gordon,  to  ob- 
tain for  him  the  place  of  captain  in  the  Scotch 
guards,  M.  de  Losse  being  promoted  to  a  higher  situa- 
tion. You  are  aware  how  highly  this  would  gratify 
me.  I  beg  you  also  to  recommend  to  them  Lord 
Walhton,  and  render  him  all  the  service  you  can.  In 
short,  I  beg  you  to  solicit,  wherever  you  can,  for  the 
good  treatment  of  all  my  faithful  subjects  and  ser- 
vants in  France.  If  I  had  the  means,  I  would  not 
importune  the  King  to  aid  them ;  but  having  none,  I 
cannot  have  recourse  to  any  but  him,  in  virtue  of  the 
ancient  alliance  between  our  countries,  and  the  honor 
I  have  of  being  his  sister.  I  beg,  also,  that  in  all 
changes  and  new  edicts,  you  will  not  be  afraid  to 
require  that  there  be  nothing  prejudicial  to  my 
dowry,  as  in  the  case  of  those  tabellionages  [the  busi- 
ness of  a  tdbcllion,  or  village  notary],  and  solicit  the 
aid  and  favor  of  M.  the  Cardinal  of  Bourbon,  of 
Mnntpensier,  and  of  M.  de  Montmorency,  to  whom  I 
Avish  you  to  address  yourself  as  familiarly  as  to  one 
of  my  relations,  wherever  you  shall  need  counsel  and 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  323 

favor,  to  aid  you  in  remonstrating  about  my  affairs 
in  that  quarter.  I  will  pray  God  to  give  you,  Mon- 
sieur fle  Glascow,  health,  and  a  long  and  happy  life. 

"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MARY  R." 

11 1  beg  you  to  send  me  some  genuine  terra  sigil- 
lata*  if  it  is  to  be  had  for  money ;  if  not,  ask  M.  the 
cardinal,  my  uncle,  for  some;  or,  if  he  has  none, 
rather  than  have  recourse  to  the  Queen,  my  mother- 
in-law,  or  to  the  King,  a  bit  of  fine  unicorn's  horn,  as 
I  am  in  great  want  of  it.f 

"  From  what  I  have  heard,  you  have  misunder- 
stood what  I  wrote  to  you,  for  I  never  said  that  your 
brothers  had  specially  solicited  me  to  take  the  seals 
from  you,  but  that  I  would  permit  you  to  retire  alto- 
gether, which  I  refused;  and, talking  of  the  seals,  they 
always  denied  that  it  was  a  thing  from  which  you 
derived  much  profit.  Your  brother  writes  to  you  as 
if  he  had  been  accused  of  having  done  you  some  ill 
turn.  I  assure  you,  and  can  testify,  that  he  never 
thought  such  a  thing;  but  he  and  your  deceased 
brother  expressed  themselves  to  me  in  the  terms 
above-mentioned ;  and  about  this  you  may  satisfy 
yourself  without  letting  La  Landouse  and  such  like, 
interfere  in  correcting  the  Magnificat.  I  will  in- 
form you  particularly  of  every  thing.  What  I  here 
tell  you  is  enough  to  satisfy  you  that  I  have  done 

*  The  terra  sigillata  was  a  seal  made  of  pottery  or  earthen- 
ware. Mary  evidently  wanted  this  as  an  amulet  or  charm. 

f  The  superstitious  notions  of  those  days  attributed,  we 
presume,  extraordinary  virtues  to  the  imaginary  as  well  as  to 
the  real  substances  for  which  the  Queen  writes  in  this  post- 
script.

nothing  to  cause  yon  displeasure;  but  I  am  not 
pleased  with  those  lawsuits,  carried  on  where  every 
one  must  be  a  judge,  and  in  the  end  I  shall  grow 
angry  with  them,  which  is  what  I  have  no  wish  to 
do.  Duvergier  had  ray  letters  before  I  h:id  let  you 
know  that  I  had  given  him  them ;  he  will  show  them 
to  you." 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  QUEEN  ELIZABETH. 

"June  9th,  [1574.] 

"  Madam,  my  good  sister — as  you  have  been 
pleased  to  intimate  to  Monsieur  de  la  Mothe  Fenelon, 
ambassador  of  the  King,  monsieur  my  good  brother, 
that  you  were  gratified  by  the  liberty  which  I  took  to 
present  to  you,  through  him,  a  trifling  piece  of  my 
work,  I  cannot  .refrain  from  assuring  you,  by  these 
lines,  how  happy  I  should  esteem  myself,  if  you 
would  be  pleased  to  permit  me  to  make  it  my  duty  to 
recover  by  any  means  whatever,  some  portion  of  your 
pood  graces,  in  which  I  most  earnestly  wish  you  to  be 
pleased  to  aid  me  by  some  intimation  in  what  way 
you  think  I  can  gratify  and  obey  you;  whenever  it  is 
your  pleasure,  I  shall  always  be  ready  to  give  yon 
proofs  of  the  honor  and  friendship  I  bear  you.  I  was 
very  glad  that  you  were  pleased  to  accept  the  sweet- 
meats which  the  said  Sieur  de  la  Mothe  presented  to 
you ;  I  am  now  writing  to  Duvergier,  my  chancellor, 
to  send  me  a  better  supply,  which  you  will  do  me  a 
favor  in  making  use  of;  and  would  to  God  that  you 
would  accept  my  services  in  more  important  things, 
in  which  T  should  show  such  readiness  to  picnic,  tli.-if. 
in  a  short  time,  you  would  have  a  better  opinion  of 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.         325 

me ;  in  the  meantime,  I  will  wait  patiently  for  some 
favorable  news  from  you,  which  I  have  been  expect- 
ing for  such  a  long  time.  And  that  I  may  not  be 
troublesome,  I  will  communicate  what  I  have  further 
to  say  through  Monsieur  de  la  Mothe,  being  assured 
that  you  will  not  credit  him  less  than  myself;  and 
having  kissed  your  hands,  I  pray  God  to  grant  you, 
madam,  my  good  sister,  health,  and  a  long  and  happy 
life.  From  Sheffield,  this  ixth  of  June. 

"  Your  very  affectionate  sister  and  cousin, 

"  MAKY  K." 

THE   QUEEN  OF  SCOTS   TO  THE  ARCHBISHOP  OF  GLAS- 
GOW. 

"  From  SHEFFIELD,  the  9th  of  July,  [1574.] 
"  Monsieur  de  Glascow — I  have  nothing  particular 
to  say  at  present,  except  that,  thank  God,  I  am  in  bet- 
ter health  than  I  was  before  using  the  baths,  and 
when  I  last  wrote  you.  I  beg  you  will  procure  for 
me  some  turtle  doves,  and  some  Barbary  fowls.  I 
wish  to  try  if  I  can  rear  them  in  this  country,  as  your 
brother  told  me  that,  when  he  was  with  you,  he  had 
raised  some  in  a  cage,  as  also  some  red  partridges; 
and  send  me,  by  the  person  who  brings  them  to  Lon- 
don, instructions  how  to  manage  them.  I  shall  take 
great  pleasure  in  rearing  them  in  cages,  which  I  do 
all  sorts  of  little  birds  I  can  meet  with.  This  will  be 
amusement  for  a  prisoner,  particularly  since  there  are 
none  in  this  country,  as  I  wrote  to  you  not  long  ago. 
Pray  see  to  it,  that  my  directions  be  complied  with, 
and  I  will  pray  God  to  have  you  in  his  keeping. 
"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MAEY  K." 


MAUY  yt  KEN   OF  SCOTS. 
THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  THE  SAME. 

"From  SHEFFIKI.D,  the  18th  July,  [1574.] 
"  Monsieur  de  Glaseow — M.  de  la  Mothe  Fenelon, 
ambassador  of  the  King,  monsieur,  my  brother,  hav- 
ing given  me  the  mournful  intelligence  of  the  decease 
of  the  said  prince,*  whom  God  absolve,  you  may 
imagine  the  grief  I  felt  for  the  lose  of  80  good  a 
brother  and  friend ;  and  if  I  had  sooner  had  the 
means,  I  should  have  commanded  you  to  go  to  visit 
and  condole,  in  my  name,  with  the  Queen-madam,  my 
good  mother,  and  with  the  Queens,  my  good  sisters, 
which  I  am  sure  you  have  not  failed  to  do,  so  well 
knowing  my  intentions;  and  having  since  heard 
lately,  from  the  said  M.  de  la  Mothe  Fenelon,  that 
there  are  hopes  at  present,  of  the  return  of  the  King, 
monsieur,  my  good  brother,  to  his  kingdom,  I  would 
not  omit  writing  this  letter,  which  I  shall  desire  him 
to  send  you,  for  the  purpose  of  informing  you  of  my 
intention,  which  is  that,  on  his  arrival,  you  go  to 
meet  and  receive  him,  performing,  in  my  name,  such 
offices  as  arc  required  of  a  good  sister  and  ally,  de- 
liver the  letters  which  I  have  written  to  him,  and  as- 
suring him  of  the  good  will  which  you  know  I  have 
always  borne,  both  toward  the  late  King  and  himself ; 
and,  if  you  have  opportunity,  recommend  me  and  my 
affairs  to  him,  and  to  the  Queen,  my  good  mother, 
also,  to  whom  I  am  now  writing,  as  also  to  the  Queen, 
my  good  sister,  and  to  MM.,  my  uncles. 

"  As  for  my  health,  it  is,  thank  God,  rather  better 
than  before  I  went  to  the  baths.     T  have  written  more 
particularly  to  the  said  Sieur  de  la  Mothe,  who,  I  am 
*  Charles  IX.,  who  died  the  31st  of  May,  1574. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  327 

sure,  will  have  apprized  them  of  it.  For  the  rest,  I 
beg  you  to  take  care  to  get  me  an  ample  reply  to  my 
dispatch  of  the  8th  of  May,  and  that  the  memorials 
which  I  sent  them,  and  since,  be  dispatched,  and  the 
substance  sent  to  M.  de  la  Mothe,  to  be  forwarded  to 
me.  If  it  please  the  Queen  of  England,  madam  my 
good  sister,  to  permit  you,  I  should  be  glad  if  you, 
would  soon  send  some  one  to  pay  my  household,  and, 
at  the  same  time,  let  me  know,  in  reply,  what  you, 
have  to  say  about  such  of  my  affairs  as  remain  to  be 
settled,  and  to  assist  me  in  remodeling  my  estimates ; 
for,  as  for  Roullet,  he  has  been  twice  on  the  point  of 
death  within  the  last  fortnight,  and  it  will  be  a  long 
time  before  he  can  assist  me  again,  if  he  should  re- 
cover, of  which  I  see  no  great  likelihood,  being  de- 
cidedly consumptive,  or  I  am  much  mistaken,  for  he 
has  a  continual  wheezing,  and  is  quite  bent.  Still, 
he  says  he  is  very  well,  and  even  within  the  last  two 
days,  told  me  he  was  sure  he  should  get  better.  At 
any  rate,  it  would  be  well  if  M.  the  cardinal,  my 
uncle,  would  provide  a  person  to  take  his  place,  his 
health  being  very  precarious,  and  the  least  thing 
causes  a  relapse;  and  let  me  know  his  name,  and  as 
much  as  you  can  of  his  disposition ;  for  it  is  necessary 
to  have  patient  and  peaceable  persons  among  prison- 
ers, who  have  not  all  the  comforts  they  wish ;  and, 
above  all,  he  must  not  be  partial  in  his  service,  other- 
wise it  would  occasion  me  more  trouble  than  ease,  and 
have  no  need  of  that,  having  had  enough  of  it  already. 
"  If,  in  traveling  to  meet  the  King,  or,  for  other  ex- 
penses connected  with  this  matter,  you  have  need  of 
some  consideration,  I  should  be  glad  if  M.,  the  cardi- 
nal, would  allow  something  extra,  only  apprising  me 


328  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

of  it.  I  shall  approve  of  it,  for  I  know  you  are  fre- 
quently in  need  of  aid,  and  have  no  desire  that  you 
should  remain  behindhand,  any  more  than  get  on  too 
fast.  On  the  first  opportunity,  I  will  recommend 
you  to  the  King,  and  renew  my  former  request  for 
you;  meanwhile,  be  careful  that  all  my  affairs  are 
conducted  according  to  my  orders. 

"  Should  you  be  permitted  to  send  me  some  one 
with  my  accounts,  send  me,  by-and-by,  Jean  de  Com- 
peigne,  and  let  him  bring  me  patterns  of  dresses,  and 
of  cloth  of  gold  and  silver,  and  of  silks,  the  handsom- 
est and  the  rarest  that  are  worn  at  court,  in  order  to 
learn  my  pleasure  about  them.  Order  Poissy  to 
make  me  a  couple  of  head-dresses,  with  a  crown  of 
gold  and  silver,  such  as  were  formerly  made  for  me ; 
and  Bretan  to  remember  his  promise,  and  to  procure 
for  me  from  Italy  some  new  fashions  of  head-dresses, 
veils,  and  ribbons  with  gold  and  silver,  and  I  will  re- 
imburse him  for  whatever  these  may  cost  him. 

"  You  must  not  forget  the  birds,  about  which  I 
lately  wrote  to  you,  and  communicate  the  contents  of 
this  letter  to  messieurs,  my  uncles,  and  beg  them  to 
let  me  have  a  share  of  the  new  things  which  fall  to 
them,  as  they  do  by  my  cousins;  for,  though  I  do 
not  wear  such  myself,  they  will  be  put  to  a  better 
purpose.  And  to  conclude,  I  will  pray  God  to  grant 
you,  M.  de  Glascow,  a  long  and  happy  life. 

"  You  must  not  fail  to  call,  in  my  name,  on  M. 
and  Madame  de  Lorraine,  and  apologize  for  my  not 
writing  to  thorn  at  present,  for  want  of  leisure.  I  do 
not  doubt  that  they  will  act  towards  me  as  a  kind 
brother  and  sister,  having  been  brought  up  with  them 
from  my  youth,  and  being  one  of  their  house.  Do 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  329 

the  same  by  my  good  sister,  the  Queen  of  Navarre, 
and  remember  me  to  all  my  relations  and  friends; 
but  more  especially  to  my  uncle,  Monsieur  the  Car- 
dinal de  Bourbon,  and  to  my  brother,  the  grand  prior, 
to  whom  I  have  not  time  to  write  at  present,  so  he 
never  writes  to  me  but  for  payment,  and  on  behalf  of 
his  servants,  at  least,  it  is  a  long  time  since  he  did. 
Remember  me,  likewise,  to  M.  and  Madame  de  Vau- 
demont,  and  M.  and  Madame  de  Nemours,  and  De 
Nevers,  and  do  not  forget  my  cousin  Du  Maine,  and 
his  brother. 

"  Serves  de  Conde,  an  old  and  faithful  servant,  has 
complained  to  me  of  having  been  forgotten  in  the  es- 
timates for  some  years.  I  desire  that  he  and  his  wife 
be  placed  at  the  head  of  the  list ;  in  the  meantime, 
I  have  given  him  an  order,  which  I  beg  you  will  see 
is  paid  him.  Tell  M.  the  Cardinal  to  furnish  him 
with  money  to  go  to  Scotland  to  take  an  inventory  of 
the  furniture  which  was  in  his  keeping  there,  and  to 
bring  a  certificate  of  what  is  wanting,  who  has  it,  and 
on  what  account  he  delivered  it  to  them,  and  likewise 
testimonials  from  M.  and  Madame  de  Huthed,  Lady  * 
Ledington,  and  Lord  Seton,  to  whom  he  may  deliver 
all  that  he  can  recover ;  and  if  I  learn  from  you,  on 
his  return,  that  he  has  rendered  a  good  account,  and 
arranged  matters  well  for  the  future,  I  will  take  such 
steps  as,  with  your  approbation,  I  may  see  fit,  for 
keeping  his  son-in-law,  or  some  other  person  there  as 
may  be  found  most  convenient. 

"  Your  very  kind  friend  and  mistress, 

"  MARY  R. 

"  Remember  me  to  the  Bishop  of  Ross — I  have 
nothing  to  write  to  him  about  at  present." 


MARY  QUERN  OF  SO 

When  Mary  learned  that  Elizabeth  kindly  accepted 
the  gifts  of  her  tasteful  hand,  she  addressed  her  in  a 
grateful  mood: 

"  Madam,  my  good  sister,  since  it  has  pleased  you 
to  receive  so  graciously  from  Monsieur  de  la  Mothe 
.  the  little  tilings  which  I  took  the  liberty  to  send  you 
by  him,  I  cannot  refrain  from  expressing  to  you  how 
happy  I  shall  fed,  when  it  pleases  you  to  allow  me  t«&gt; 
endeavor,  by  all  means,  to  regain  some  part  of  your 
favor,  to  do  which  I  greatly  desire  you  to  have  the 
goodness  to  aid  me,  by  informing  me  of  the  matters 
in  which  I  can  please  and  obey  you." 

She  also  wrote  the  French  ambassador:  "I  feel 
the  greatest  satisfaction  at  the  news  you  give  me,  that 
it  has  pleased  the  Queen,  my  good  sister,  to  accept 
my  tablets ;  for  I  desire  nothing  so  much  as  to  be  able 
always  to  please  her,  in  the  least  as  well  as  in  the 
most  important  affairs,  and  I  do  this  in  the  hope  of 
recovering  her  favor,  in  the  first  place,  and  then  I  do 
not  doubt  of  her  goodness  in  all  the  rest  I  am  de- 
sirous to  make  her  a  head-dress  as  soon  as  I  can,  but  I 
•  have  so  few  women  to  assist  me  in  delicate  needle- 
work, that  I  have  not  been  able  to  get  it  ready  yet. 
If  you  think  some  articles  of  network  would  pi- 
her  better  than  anything  else,  I  will  make  them. 
Meanwhile,  I  beg  you  to  get  for  me  some  gold  lace 
ornamented  with  silver  spangles,  the  best  and  most 
delicate  that  you  can,  and  to  send  me  six  yards  of  it, 
and  twentv  yards  of  double  lace,  or  else  narrow  good 
lace." 

Mary  was  subdued,  and  pity  was  the  highest  hom- 
age awarded  the  abject  Queen.  The  troubler  of  mon- 
arcbs, — the  beautiful  conspirator,  whose  plots  shook 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  331 

kingdoms,  has  stooped  to  play  the  milliner  to  her  im- 
perious rival. 

The  correspondence  with  the  Archbishop  of  Glas- 
gow was  filial  and  frank,  when  private.  She  wrote 
tenderly  after  the  death  of  her  secretary,  Roullet: 

"  From  SHEFFIELD,  the  4th  of  September,  1574. 

"  Monsieur  de  Glascow,  it  pleased  God  to  take 
Roullet,  my  secretary,  out  of  this  wretched  life  into 
his  glory,  on  the  last  day  but  one  of  August,  at  eight 
o'clock  in  the  morning,  and  so  suddenly,  that  when  I 
sent  to  inquire  after  him,  as  was  my  custom  every 
morning,  he  was  breathing  his  last,  so  that  he  said 
nothing  when  dying,  about  what  he  had  requested  of 
me  before.  I  have  set  down  what  he  said,  as  nearly 
as  I  can  recollect,  in  a  letter  to  M.  Ferrarius,  and  to 
Hoteman ;  which  you  will  ask  to  see,  and  solicit  them 
to  accept  the  duty  he  has  bequeathed  them,  and  let  me 
know  whether  they  will  fulfill  it.  He  has  left  me  the 
five  thousand  francs,  which  I  lately  made  him  a  pres- 
ent of,  saying  that  he  had  sufficient  to  fufill  his  last 
wishes.  You  must  inquire  respecting  this,  and,  if 
you  find  it  to  be  so-,  withdraw  the  said  sum  from 
Hoteman,  or  from  the  treasurer,  because  one  or  the 
other  has  received  it  for  him,  and  which  you  can  re- 
tain until  you  hear  my  further  intentions.  Make 
diligent  inquiry  for  some  one  to  serve  me  as  secretary, 
and  send  him  to  me  as  early  as  possible ;  for  I  must 
not  act  any  longer  in  this  capacity,  unless  I  wish  to 
kill  myself. 

"  I  beg  you  to  inform  my  treasurer  that  I  am  dis- 
pleased, because  my  officers  here,  with  the  exception 
of  one  or  two,  are  not  paid  according  to  the  order  I 


332  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOM. 

gave  him ;  ;in&lt;l  those  whom  he  has  paid,  at  least  Du 
Cartel,  my  surgeon,  tells  me  that  he  has  reckoned  the 
crown  at  sixty  sous.*  Inquire  if  that  is  the  value 
of  it,  for,  if  he  wrongs  my  servants  to  make  a  profit 
.by  them,  I  will  not  suffer  it.  lie  has  had  sufficient 
profit  by  holding  their  wages  from  them  for  so  long  a 
time  after  they  were  due,  and  in  only  paying  those 
whom  he  pleased ;  though  there  was  no  need  for  it, 
because  they  compounded  with  him  for  one  half,  as, 
Chateaudum  was  in  the  habit  of  doing  with  my  offi- 
cers. Dolu  wrote  to  me  that  he  had  paid  all;  but  I 

see  to  the  contrary:  he  has  no for 

he  confesses,  himself,  that  he  is  in  my  debt.  I  beg 
you  will  show  him  that  part  of  my  letter  which  re- 
lates to  him,  or  let  him  know  that  I  am  extremely 
displeased,  as  he  shall  find,  if  he  does  not  endeavor 
to  satisfy  my  poor  servants  who  are  about  me,  and 
those  who  are  recommended  to  me.  I  beg  you  will 
see  that  nothing  further  be  done  contrary  to  my  in- 
structions. Roullet  is  dead ;  they  can  no  longer  sus- 
pect that  it  is  he  who  puts  this  into  my  head;  and, 
as  for  Duvergier,  he  never  spoke  to  me  about  him ; 
but  I  insist  that  he  and  all  others  obey  me  and  fol- 
low my  orders,  let  them  displease  whom  they  will ; 
and,  as  I  am  in  expectation  of  your  general  dispatch, 
I  will  not  say  more  at  present,  but  desire  you  to  beg 
the  cardinal,  my  uncle,  not  to  permit  any  more  money 
to  be  spent  in  the  suit  with  Secondat ;  for  I  tell  you 
plainly,  that  I  will  give  it  up,  rather  than  lay  out  an- 
other farthing  upon  it,  let  my  counsel  think  what 

*  If  the  English  crown  Is  here  meant,  it  was  worth  $1.12. 
The  sou  was  worth  about  one  cent.    Mary's  suspicions  seem 
justified  in  this  mutter. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  333 

they  please,  unless  they  make  it  appear  that  there 
is  a  better  prospect  than  I  see  at  present.  As  far  as 
I  can  learn,  the  six  thousand  francs  are  to  be  followed 
by  more ;  I  set  my  face  against  it ;  show  this  to  my 
said  uncle,  that  he  may  forbid  them  to  proceed  fur- 
ther without  his  consent. 

"  I  have  received  a  letter  from  Saint  Cheran,  ap- 
plying for  the  situation  of  his  brother,  who  is  in 
Champagne.  Tell  him  that,  having  seen  the  dis- 
patch, by-and-by,  according  as  he  behaves  himself, 
if  he  treads  in  the  steps  of  his  brother,  and  relies  on 
me  only,  I  will  willingly  comply  with  his  request, 
and  take  him  into  my  service,  for  I  insist  that  my  offi- 
cers, especially  those  who  are  here  with  me,  depend 
entirely  upon  me,  and  no  other  person.  If  any 
should  urge  my  chancellor  to  do  any  act  without  first 
consulting  me,  I  beg  you  will  take  care  that  he  re- 
fuses, until  my  intention  be  known,  for  that  was  the 
principal  reason  why  I  took  him,  and  that  he  should 
depend  on  none  but  me.  In  so  doing,  I  beg,  as  you 
love  me,  to  support  him,  for  I  am  resolved  to  be 
obeyed. 

"  For  the  rest,  present  my  humble  remembrances 
to  the  King,  M.  my  good  brother,  and  to  the  Queen, 
my  good  mother,  and  beg  them  to  command  that  all 
privileges  and  things  in  my  gift  may  be  reserved  for 
me,  and  not  given  away,  as  they  have  been  for  some 
years  past,  under  the  name  of  grants  from  the  King. 
Remember  me  to  Messrs.,  my  uncles,  to  my  cousins, 
and  to  all  my  kind  relations  and  friends,  and  take 
care  to  send  your  dispatch  by  a  trusty  person,  and 
furnished  with  a  safe  passport  for  what  I  want,  as  all 
the  letters  of  Senlis  were  taken  from  him.  After  sin-

cerely  recommending  myself  to  your  remembrance,  I 
pray  God  to  have  you  in  his  holy  and  worthy  keeping. 
"  I  beg  you  will  desire  my  treasurer  to  pay  the 
money  as  soon  as  possible  to  old  Curie,  for  I  fear  that 
the  assignment  will  be  at  a  long  date,  and  that  he  has 
great  need  of  it  for  his  poor  motherless  children.  I 
recommend  him  to  you.  I  have  not  leisure  to  reply 
to  the  requests  of  Walker,  nor  have  I  a  creature  to 
assist  me;  tell  them  they  shall  not  be  forgotten,  nor 
yet  the  young  lady  who  was  to  have  come  with  Ral- 
lay,  who,  perhaps,  some  day  may  Ix?  in  my  service. 
"  Your  very  good  mistress  and  friend, 

"  MARY  R." 

"  Apprise  M.,  the  cardinal,  that  if  any  one  speaks 
to  him  for  the  situation  of  maitre  d'hotel,  held  by  the 
late  Esguilli,  he  must  not  promise  it,  for  I  intend  to 
make  alterations  in  my  household,  and  to  have  this 
situation  abolished,  as  I  have,  likewise,  resolved  to  do 
in  regard  to  many  others,  as  they  become  vacant.  I 
shall  do  the  same  with  Roullet's  pension,  leaving  only 
the  wages  of  a  secretary  for  another  in  his  place,  and 
I  will  not  permit  any  persons  to  be  placed  over  there 
on  my  list  without  my  knowledge,  or  I  shall  strike 
them  out. 

"  Do  not  forget  my  humble  remembrances  to  Mad- 
ame, my  grandmother.  Roullet  has  left  letters  which 
he  wrote  to  you,  without  addressing  them,  to  M.  de 
Ross  an&lt;l  t«&gt;  M.  the  cardinal,  whom  I  ought  to  have 
mentioned  first;  I  shall  reserve  them  for  better  op- 
portunity, us  they  are  not  important,  being  merely  on 
the  matter  concerning  which  ho  conceived  himself  t«« 
be  suspected  over  there.  Remember  me  to  M.  de

Ross,  to  whom  I  have  not  leisure  to  write  at  present." 

A  few  weeks  after  she  expressed  her  interest  in  the 
trifles  which  beguiled  her  solitary  hours,  and  com- 
mends a  friend  in  France,  to  his  regard : 

"  SHEFFIELD,  the  13th  November,  [1574.] 
"  M.  de  Glascow — having  received  the  sweetmeats 
by  the  hands  of  the  bearer,  the  brother  of  my  chan- 
cellor, Duvergier,  I  have  thought  it  right  to  give  you 
a  line  by  him,  merely  to  tell  you  that  I  am  well, 
thank  God,  and  waiting  for  my  secretary,  and  if  you 
do  not  make  haste  and  send  him,  you  will  hear  no 
more  from  me,  for  so  much  writing  makes  me  ill. 
Till  then,  I  shall  not  write  to  you  about  business; 
but  do  not  forget,  as  you  are  so  often  at  Lyons,  to  send 
my  little  dogs.  For  the  rest,  Madame  de  Briante  has 
returned  into  France,  where  she  is  likely  to  have  a 
great  deal  to  do,  especially  with  her  brother-in-law, 
respecting  her  dowry.  If  she  has  need  of  my  inter- 
est with  him,  or  with  any  other,  or  with  those  of  the 
law,  I  beg  you  to  do  all  in  your  power  to  assist  her  and 
to  request  M.  the  cardinal,  my  uncle,  to  do  what  he 
can  for  her  in  all  her  affairs;  and,  if  she  needs  let- 
ters of  recommendation  from  him,  or  from  any  of 
my  relatives  or  kindred,  you  must  procure  them  for 
her  in  my  name,  with  leave  of  my  said  uncle ;  so  that, 
if  she  has  occasion  to  solicit  the  settlement  of  her 
suits  in  Paris,  he  may,  for  my  sake,  accommodate  her 
with  apartments  in  some  one  of  his  houses,  that  may 
be  most  suitable.  She  is  an  excellent  and  virtuous 
lady,  and  an  old  servant  of  the  late  Queen,  my 
mother,  and  of  myself,  and  her  daughter  is  daily  ren-

Henry  III.  ascended  the  throne  of  France,  and  the 
captive  felt  a  rising  hope  in  his  reputed  bravery  and 
devotion  to  Popery.  But  he  soon  blasted  the  expecta- 
tion, by  his  characterless,  undecided  reign.  Death 
robbed  her,  at  this  time,  of  a  faithful  ally.  Tidings 
that  Cardinal  Lorraine  was  no  more,  reached  the  dis- 
consolate Queen.  Not  hearing  immediately  from  the 
archbishop  on  the  subject,  she  wrote  him,  complain- 
ing of  neglect : 

"  From  SHEFFIELD,  20th  February,  [1575.] 
"  Monsieur  de  Glascow — I  am  much  astonished 
that,  on  so  melancholy  event,  I  have  neither  received 
information  nor  consolation  from  you.  I  cannot  at- 
tribute this  to  anything  but  the  extreme  sorrow  you 
fed  for  the  loss  I  have  sustained :  yet  God  be  praised, 
if  he  sends  me  afflictions,  he  has,  thus  far,  given  me 
grace  to  support  them.  Though  I  cannot,  at  the  first 
moment,  command  my  feelings,  or  prevent  the  tears 
that  will  flow,  yet  my  long  adversity  has  taught  me 
to  hope  for  consolation  for  all  my  afflictions  in  a  bet- 
ter life.  Alas!  I  am  a  prisoner,  and  God  has  boroft 
JIM-  &lt;&gt;f  «&gt;nc  of  those  persons  whom  I  most  loved;  whnt 
shall  I  say  more  ?  He  has  bereft  me,  at  one  blow,  of 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  337 

my  father  and  my  uncle ;  I  shall  now  follow  when- 
ever he  pleases,  Avith  less  regret ;  but  yet,  instead  of 
comforting  me,  do  not  distress  yourself  too  much  on 
my  account,  lest  I  might  be  deprived  of  a  good  and 
faithful  servant,  which,  I  feel  assured,  I  have  in 
you." 

Mary  Stuart  still  looked,  with  faint  anticipation  of 
aid,  to  Philip  IL,  and  resumed  correspondence  re- 
specting an  invasion  of  England.  Her  failing  health 
and  perils  drew  forth  the  following  singular  and  un- 
natural disposal  of  her  son,  quoted  from  a  message 
to  the  Archbishop  of  Glasgow: 

"  In  order  not  to  contravene  the  glory,  honor,  and 
preservation  of  the  Catholic,  Apostolic,  and  Roman 
church,  in  which*  I  wish  to  live  and  die,  if  the  prince 
of  Scotland,  my  son,  shall  be  brought  back  to  its 
creed  in  spite  of  the  bad  education  he  has  received, 
to  my  great  regret,  in  the  heresy  of  Calvin,  among 
my  rebellious  subjects,  I  leave  him  the  sole  and  only 
heir  of  my  kingdom  of  Scotland,  and  of  the  right 
which  I  justly  claim  to  the  crown  of  England  and  its 
dependent  countries;  but  ii",  on  the  other  hand,  my 
said  son  continues  to  live  in  the  said  heresy,  I  yield 
and  transfer  and  present  all  my  rights  in  England 
and  elsewhere  ...  to  the  Catholic  King,  or  any  of 
his  relations  whom  he  may  please,  with  the  advice 
and  consent  of  his  Holiness ;  and  I  do  this,  not  only 
because  I  perceive  him  to  be  now  the  only  true  sup- 
porter of  the  Catholic  religion,  but  also  out  of  grati- 
tude for  the  many  favors  which  I  and  my  friends, 
recommended  by  me,  have  received  from  him  in  my

greatest  necessity,  and  furthermore,  out  of  respect  to 
the  rights  which  he  may  himself  possess  to  the  said 
kingdoms  and  countries.  I  beseech  him,  in  return, 
to  make  alliance  with  the  house  of  Lorraine,  and,  if 
possible,  with  that  of  Guise,  in  memory  of  the  racq 
from  which  I  am  sprung  on  my  mother's  side." 

A  part  of  Mary's  correspondence  during  the  years 
1579-80,  will  afford  a  glance  at  her  somewhat  mo- 
notonous life: 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  THE  ABCHBISHOP  OF  GLAS- 
GOW. 

"  June  24,  1579. 

"  Mon's  de  Glascow — Owing  to  the  absence  of 
X;ui,  who  set  out  a  fortnight  ago  for  Scotland,  on  a 
visit  to  my  son,*  and  to  my  having  been  rather  indis- 
jiosed — many  thanks  to  Du  Y.il,  whom  I  expected 
here  to  physic  (purgcr)  me  for  this  whole  summer — 
I  could  not  give  an  earlier  answer  to  your  last  let- 
ters. I  shall  therefore  begin  by  requesting  you  to  put 
the  irons  in  the  fire  againvand  try  to  find  me  another 
physician  who  is  not  a  deceiver,  and  make  Lusgeri 
do  the  same;  and,  meanwhile,  give  me  your  opinion 
of  any  who  may  offer  themselves.  I  have  ordered 
Duvergier,  my  chancellor,  if  he  knows  of  any  person,

letter  to  her  son,  together  with  some  jewels  of  value,  and  a 
vest,  embroidered  with  her  own  hand.  But,  as  she  gave  him 
only  the  title  of  Prince  of  Scotland,  the  messenger  was  dis-

to  send  him  to  you,  so  that  you  may  speak  to  him, 
and  be  able  to  give  me  your  opinion.  I  fear  he  will 
find  work  cut  out  for  him,  as  I  begin  to  be  unwell, 
and  am  suffering  from  what  I  have  not  had  for  a  long 
time — a  very  bad,  dry  cough.  I  am  glad  that  you 
have  gone  to  the  baths  for  the  benefit  of  your  health, 
but  am  sorry  that  you  could  not  be  present,  according 
to  my  desire,  at  the  rendering  of  the  accounts  of  Dolu, 
my  treasurer.  I  hope  soon  to  be  able  to  inform  you, 
whom  I  intend  to  appoint  in  his  place.  As  to  the 
affair  of  Madam  de  Humieres,  you  will  do  well  to 
make  inquiry  about  it,  for  I  think  it  a  sad  thing  that 
the  fief  should  be  so  much  diminished,  since  she  her- 
self wrote  to  me,  at  her  leisure,  respecting  it.  Touch-, 
ing  the  request  of  your  secretary,  I  cannot,  for  sev- 
eral reasons,  comply  with  it  at  present.  I  beg  you, 
on  your  return,  to  give  me  a  full  account  of  the  state 
of  my  affairs,  and  to  look  well  after  them ;  and,  in  re- 
turn, I  hope  to  be  able,  on  the  arrival  of  Nau,  to  in- 
form you  of  that  of  your  old  mistress  and  your  young 
master.  So  the  latter  be  but  satisfactory,  the  former 
cannot  be  otherwise.  And,  in  this  place,  after  heart- 
ily commending  myself  to  you,  I  pray  God  to  give 
you,  M.  de  Glascow,  a  long  and  happy  life.

THE  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS  TO  M.   DE   MAUVISSIERE. 

"Monsieur  de  Mauvissiere — Having  purchased 
two  beautiful  rare  nags  for  my  cousin.  Monsieur  de 
Guise,  it  was  my  intention  to  have  immediately  sent 
thorn  lx&gt;th  in  charge'  of  the  l&gt;oarer,  who  is  obliged  to 
return  to  Franco  with  his  wife,  for  the  euro  of  a  di&lt;

winter.  But  one  of  the  said  horses  having  been  ail- 
ing (forbeu)  for  the  last  seven  or  eight  days,  I 
thought  it  advisable  not  to  miss  this  opportunity,  nor 
the  season,  for  sending  the  other,  which  I  have  given 
in  charge  to  the  groom,  who  has  for  some  time  past 
had  it  under  his  particular  care,  and  I  have  given  him 
strict  orders  to  take  it  to  your  house;  and  you  will 
oblige  me  to  let  it  be  led  by  one  of  your  grooms,  to  my 
ambassador,  in  order  that  he  may  present  it,  in  my 
name,  to  my  said  cousin,  and  to  pay  my  expenses  in- 
curred. I  think  you  will  have  no  difficulty  about  his 
journey,  with  the  passport  which  it  will  be  necessary 
to  obtain  for  the  purpose,  any  more  than  for  that  of 
any  of  my  said  officers;  I  shall,  therefore,  not  give 
you  any  more  particular  directions  on  the  subject, 
praying  God,  Monsieur  de  Mauvissiere,to  have  you  in 
his  holy  and  worthy  care.  Written  at  the  manor  of 
Sheffield,  the  iii.  day  of  September,  1580. 

"  Your  very  obliging  and  best  friend, 

"  MABY  R." 

Morton,  Regent  of  Scotland,  had  for  five  years 
ruled  wisely  over  the  realm.  Commerce  prospered 
in  the  universal  peace,  and  the  transforming  progress 
in  every  branch  of  national  prosperity  was  the  theme 
of  eulogy  with  foreign  ambassadors.  The  fruits  of 
a  Protestant  reign  were  benign  and  happy.  But  the 
restless  nobles  demanded  his  resignation,  and  the  in- 
vestment of  James  VI.,  then  thirteen  years  of  .age, 
with  full  authority.  After  great  reverses  of  fortune 
within  a  short  period,  Morton  was  condemned  to  the 
scaffold,  June  2d,  1581,  on  the  charge  of  complicity 
in  the  murder  of  Darnley.  He  confessed  his  knowl- 


342  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

edge  of  the  conspiracy,  but  denied  any  connection 
with  it,  not  daring,  he  affirmed,  to  reveal  it,  because 
the  Queen  approved  the  regicide.  He  died  with  un- 
faltering firmness  and  resignation.  Mary  heard  with 
unfeigned  satisfaction  of  the  execution  of  an  enemy, 
whose  death  was  favorable  to  her  aspirations. 

Mary  had  refused  to  give  James  VI.  the  title  of 
King,  and  when  her  messenger,  Nau,  presented  him- 
self with  maternal  gifts,  the  youthful  prince  denied 
him  audience,  because  his  mother  had  omitted  the 
royal  address. 

A  new  scheme  was  proposed  of  association  in  the 
crown.  The  conditions  were,  the  resignation  of  the 
sceptre  to  Mary,  and  her  restoration  of  it  again  to  her 
son.  The  management  of  the  affair  was  committed 
to  the  Duke  of  Guise.  It  was  another  Catholic  de- 
vice, similar  to  that  of  1570.  Earl  of  Lennox,  for- 
merly   Stuart,  a  Catholic  favorite  of  James,  held 

a  commanding  influence,  and  secretly  used  it  to 
weaken  the  strength  of  the  Presbyterian  church. 
Preparatory  to  his  ultimate  plans,  he  reestablished 
the  Episcopal  church  for  the  benefit  of  the  Protes- 
tant nobility.  The  English  ambassador  at  Edinburgh 
disclosed  to  the  nobles  who  were  faithful  to  the  Refor- 
mation, the  negotiations  in  progress,  and  the  danger 
to  their  religion  and  lives,  if  the  project  of  associa- 
tion in  the  crown  succeeded.  The  result  was  another 
formidable  confederation  to  put  down  Lennox,  defeat 
the  designs  of  the  Queon,  and  guard  the  Protestant 
faith.  Lennox  moved  fearlessly  forward ;  but  intelli- 
gence reaching  the  confederates  of  his  incautious 
haste,  they  resolved  to  strike  a  blow  without  delay. 
The  King  was  enjoying  the  chase  near  Perth.  The 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  343 

Earl  of  Gourie  invited  him  to  his  castle  at  Ruthven, 
when  suddenly  it  was  environed  with  a  thousand  men. 
The  captive  wept  and  expostulated  in  vain;  he  was 
carried  to  the  fortress  of  Stirling  Castle.  Lennox, 
after  attempting  to  intrench  himself  at  Edinburgh, 
retired  into  France,  where  he  soon  died. 

This  disastrous  experiment  of  Mary's  friends,  once 
more  plunged  her  into  the  abyss  of  helplessness  and 
despair;  while  Elizabeth  was  elated  with  the  tri- 
umphs of  her  unshaken  authority.  In  the  extremity 
of  her  condition,  she  wrote  a  long  and  deeply  inter- 
esting letter : 

THE   QUEEN   OF  SCOTS   TO   QUEEN  ELIZABETH.* 

"Madam — Upon  that  which  has  come  to  my  knowl- 
edge of  the  last  conspiracies  executed  in  Scotland 
against  my  poor  child,  having  reason  to  fear  the  con- 
sequences of  it,  from  the  example  of  myself,  I  must 
employ  the  very  small  remainder  of  my  life  and 
strength  before  my  death,  to  discharge  my  heart  to 

*  Blackwood,  whose  history  of  the  sufferings  of  Mary  was 
published  so  early  as  1587,  says:"The  Queen  at  the  reported 
seizure  of  her  son  by  Lord  Gowry,  having  received  an  intima- 
tion of  her  son's  captivity,  fell  so  sick  that  she  thought  she 
should  die,  as  the  English  physicians  reported  she  would  to 
their  mistress,  who  wanted  nothing  better,  having  the  son 
already  in  his  power,  or,  which  was  the  same,  in  the  hands 
of  the  people  who  were  devoted  to  her  ;  with  which  the  poor 
mother,  being  greatly  agitated  in  her  mind,  after  she  had  ad- 
dressed her  prayers  to  God,  put  her  hand  to  the  pen,  thinking 
to  obtain  favor  from,  and  to  soften  the  heart  of,  her  cousin 
by  this  address."  The  French  original  of  this  "  celebrated 
letter,"  as  Chalmers  calls  it,  is  in  the  British  Museum,  Cotton 
lib.  Calig.  c.  vii.  51. 


344  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

you  fully  of  my  just  and  melancholy  complaints;  of 
which  I  desire  that  this  letter  may  serve  you  as  long 
as  you  live  after  me,  for  a  perpetual  testimony  and 
engraving  upon  your  conscience,  as  much  for  my  dis- 
charge to  posterity,  as  to  the  shame  and  confusion  of 
all  those  who,  under  your  approbation,  have  so  cruelly 
and  unworthily  treated  me  to  this  time,  and  reduced 
me  to  the  extremity  in  which  I  am.  But  as  their 
designs,  practices,  actions,  and  proceedings,  though 
as  detestable  as  they  could  have  been,  have  always 
prevailed  with  you  against  my  very  just  remon- 
strances and  sincere  deportment;  and  as  the  power 
which  you  have  in  your  hands  has  always  been  a 
reason  for  you  among  mankind ;  I  will  have  recourse 
to  the  living  God,  our  only  judge,  who  has  estab- 
lished us  equally  and  immediately  under  him,  for 
the  government  of  his  people. 

"  I  will  invoke  him,  till  the  end  of  this,  my  very 
pressing  affliction,  that  he  will  return  to  you  and  to 
me  (as  he  will  do  in  his  last  judgment,)  the  share  of 
our  merits  and  demerits  one  toward  the  other.  And 
remember,  madam,  that  to  him  we  shall  not  be  able 
to  disguise  anything  by  the  point  and  policy  of  tho 
world;  though  mine  enemies,  under  you,  have  been 
able,  for  a  time,  to  cover  their  subtle  inventions  to 
men,  perhaps  to  you. 

"  In  his  name,  and  before  him  sitting  between  you 
and  me,  I  will  remind  you  that,  by  the  agents,  spies, 
and  secret  messengers,  sent  in  your  name  to  Scotland 
while  I  was  there,  my  subjects  were  encouraged  to 
rebel  against  me,  to  make  attempts  upon  my  person, 
and,  in  a  word,  to  speak,  do,  enterprise,  and  execute 
that  which  has  come  to  the  said  country  during  my 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  345 

troubles ;  of  which  I  will  not,  at  present,  specify 
other  proof  than  that  which  I  have  gained  of  it  by  the 
confession  of  one  who  was  afterward  among  those 
that  were  most  advanced  for  this  good  service,  and 
of  the  witnesses  confronted  with  him.  To  whom,  if 
I  had  since  done  justice,  he  had  not  afterward,  by  his 
ancient  intelligences,  renewed  the  same  practices 
against  my  son,  and  had  not  procured  for  all  my  trai- 
torous and  rebellious  subjects  who  took  refuge  with 
you,  that  aid  and  support  which  they  have  had,  even 
since  my  detention  on  this  side;  without  which  sup- 
port I  think  the  said  traitors  could  not  since  have 
prevailed,  nor  afterward  have  stood  out  so  long  as 
they  have  done. 

"  During  my  imprisonment  at  Lochleven,  the  late 
Trogmarton  [Throckmorton]  counseled  me  on  your 
behalf  to  sign  that  demission  which  he  advertised  me 
would  be  presented  to  me,  assuring  me  that  it  would 
not  be  valid.  And  there  was  not  afterward  a  place 
in  Christendom,  where  it  was  held  for  valid  or  main- 
tained, except  on  this  side,  [where  it  was  maintained] 
even  to  having  assisted  with  open  force,  the  authors 
of  it.  In  your  conscience,  madam,  would  you  ac- 
knowledge an  equal  liberty  and  power  in  your  sub- 
jects ?  Notwithstanding  this,  my  authority  has  been 
by  my  subjects  transferred  to  my  son,  when  he  was 
not  capable  of  exercising  it. 

"  And  since  I  was  willing  to  assure  it  lawfully  to 
him,  he  being  of  age  to  be  assisted  to  his  own  advan- 
tage, it  is  suddenly  ravished  from  him,  and  assigned 
over  to  two  or  three  traitors ;  who,  having  taken  from 
him  the  effectiveness  of  it,  will  take  from  him  as 
they  have  from  me,  both  the  name  and  the  title  of  it, 


;,»»;  MAUY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

if  he  contradicts  them  in  the  manner  he  may,  and 
perhaps  his  life,  if  God  does  not  provide  for  his  pres- 
ervation. 

"  When  I  was  escaped  from  Lochleven,  ready  to 
give  battle  to  my  rebels,  I  remitted  to  you,  by  a  gen- 
tleman express,  a  diamond  jewel,  which  I  had  for- 
merly received  as  a  token  from  you,  and  with  assur- 
ance to  be  succored  against  my  rebels,  and  even  that, 
on  my  retiring  toward  you,  you  would  come  to  the 
very  frontiers  in  order  to  assist  me;  which  had  been 
confirmed  to  me  by  divers  messengers. 

"  This  promise,  coming,  and  repeatedly,  from  your 
mouth,  (though  I  had  found  myself  often  deceived  by 
your  ministers,)  made  me  place  siich  affiance  on  the 
effectiveness  of  it,  that,  when  my  army  was  routed,  I 
hud  come  directly  to  throw  myself  into  your  arms,  if 
I  had  been  able  to  approach  them.  But,  while  I  was 
planning  to  set  out,  there  was  I  arrested  on  my  way, 
surrounded  with  guards,  secured  in  strong  places,  and 
at  last  reduced,  all  shame  set  aside,  to  the  captivity 
in  which  I  remain  to  this  day,  after  a  thousand 
deaths,  which  I  have  already  suffered  from  it. 

"  I  know  that  you  will  allege  to  me  what  passed 
between  the  late  Duke  [of]  Norfolk  and  me.  I 
maintain  that  there  was  nothing  in  this  to  your  pre- 
judice or  against  the  public  good  of  this  realm,  and 
that  the  treaty  was  sanctioned  with  the  advice  and 
signatures  of  the  first  persons  who  were  then  of  your 
council,  under  the  assurance  of  making  it  appear  good 
to  you.  How  could  such  jxrsonages  have  under- 
taken the  enterprise  of  making  you  consent  to  a  point 
•which  should  deprive  you  of  life,  of  honor,  and  your 
crown,  as  you  have  shown  yourself  persuaded  it  would 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  347 

have  done  to  all  the  ambassadors  and  others,  who 
speak  to  you  concerning  me. 

"  In  the  meantime,  my  rebels  perceiving  that  their 
headlong  course  was  carrying  them  much  further 
than  they  had  thought  before,  and  the  truth  being 
evidenced  concerning  the  calumnies  that  had  been 
propagated  of  me  at  the  conference  to  which  I  sub- 
mitted, in  full  assembly  of  your  deputies  and  mine, 
with  others  of  the  contrary  party  in  that  country,  in 
order  to  clear  myself  publicly  of  them ;  there  were  the 
principals,  for  having  come  to  repentance,  besieged 
by  your  forces  in  the  Castle  of  Edinburgh,  and  one 
of  the  first  among  them  poisoned,*  and  the  other  most 
cruelly  hanged  ;f  after  I  had  twice  made  them  lay 
down  their  arms  at  your  request,  in  hopes  of  an 
agreement,  which  God  knows  whether  my  enemies 
aimed  at. 

"  I  have  been  for  a  long  time  trying  whether  pa- 
tience could  soften  the  rigor  and  ill-treatment  which 
they  have  begun  for  these  ten  years  peculiarly  to 
make  me  suffer.  And,  accommodating  myself  exactly 
to  the  order  prescribed  me  for  my  captivity  in  this 
house,  as  well  in  regard  to  the  number  and  quality 
of  the  attendants  which  I  retain,  dismissing  the 
others,  as  for  my  diet  and  ordinary  exercises  for  my 
health,  I  am  living  at  present  as  quietly  and  peac- 
ably  as  one  much  inferior  to  myself,  and  more  obliged 
than  with  such  treatment  I  was  to  you,  had  been  able 
to  do;  even  to  the  abstaining,  in  order  to  take  from 
you  all  shadow  of  suspicion  and  diffidence,  from  re- 
quiring to  have  some  intelligence  with  my  son  and 
my  country,  which  is  what  by  no  right  or  reason  could

IM  denied  me,  ami  partirnlarly  with  my  child ;  whom, 
instead  of  this,  they  endeavored  by  every  way  to  per- 
suade against  me,  in  order  to  weaken  us  by  our  di- 
.  vision. 

"  I  was  permitted,  you  will  say,  to  send  one  to  visit 
him  there  about  three  years  ago.  His  captivity  then 
at  Stirling  under  the  tyranny  of  Morton,  was  tin- 
cause  of  it,  as  his  liberty  was  afterward  of  the  refusal 
to  make  a  like  visit.  All  this  year  past  I  have  sev- 
eral times  entered  into  divers  overtures  for  the  estab- 
lishment of  a  good  amity  between  us,  and  a  sure 
understanding  between  these  two  realms  in  future. 
About  ten  years  ago,  commissioners  were  sent  to  me 
at  Chatsworth  for  that  purpose.  A  treaty  has  been 
held  upon  it  with  yourself,  by  my  ambassadors  and 
those  of  France.  I  even  myself  made  last  winter  all 
the  advantageous  overtures  concerning  it  to  Beal,  that 
it  was  possible  to  make.  What  return  have  I  had 
from  them  ?  My  good  intention  has  been  despised, 
the  sincerity  of  my  actions  has  been  neglected  and 
calumniated,  the  state  of  my  affairs  has  been  trav- 
ersed by  delays,  postponings,  and  other  such  like 
artifices.  And,  in  conclusion,  a  worse  and  more  un- 
worthy treatment  from  day  to  day,  in  spite  of  any- 
thing which  I  am  obliged  to  do  to  deserve  the  country, 
and  my  very  long,  useless,  and  prejudicial  patience, 
have  reduced  me  so  low,  that  mine  enemies,  in  their 
habits  of  using  me  ill,  now  think  they  have  the  right 
of  prescription  for  treating  me,  not  as  a  prisoner, 
which  in  reason  T  could  not  be,  but  as  a  slave,  wh"&lt;r 
life  and  whose  death  de|x»nd  only  upon  their  tyranny. 

"I  cannot,  madam,  endure  it  any  longer;  and  T 
must  in  dying  discover  the  authors  of  my  death,  or

living,  attempt,  under  your  protection,  to  find  an  end 
to  the  cruelties,  calumnies,  and  traitorous  designs  of 
my  said  enemies,  in  order  to  establish  me  in  some  lit- 
tle more  repose  for  the  remainder  of  my  life.  To 
take  away  the  occasions  pretended  for  all  the  differ- 
ences between  us,  banish  from  your  mind,  if  you 
please,  all  that  has  been  reported  to  you  concerning 
my  actions;  review  the  depositions  of  the  foreigners 
taken  in  Ireland ;  let  those  of  the  Jesuits  last  executed 
be  submitted  to  you;  give  liberty  to  those  who  would 
undertake  to  accuse  me  publicly,  and  permit  me  to 
enter  upon  my  defence ;  if  any  evil  be  found  in  me, 
let  me  suffer  for  it;  it  shall  be  patiently,  when  I 
know  the  occasion  of  it ;  if  any  good,  allow  me  not  to 
be  worse  treated  for  it,  with  your  very  high  commis- 
sion before  God  and  man. 

"  The  vilest  criminals  that  are  in  your  prisons, 
born  under  your  obedience,  are  admitted  to  their  jus- 
tification ;  and  their  accusers  and  their  accusations 
are  always  declared  to  them.  Why,  then,  shall  not 
the  same  order  have  place  toward  me,  a  sovereign 
Queen,  your  nearest  relation  and  lawful  heir  ?  I 
think  that  this  last  circumstance  has  hitherto  been 
on  the  side  of  my  enemies,  the  principal  cause  of  all 
their  calumnies,  to  make  their  unjust  pretensions 
slide  between  the  two,  and  keep  us  in  division.  But, 
alas !  they  have  now  little  reason  and  less  need  to  tor- 
ment me  more  upon  this  account.  For  I  protest  to 
you,  upon  mine  honor,  that  I  look  this  day  for  no 
kingdom  but  that  of  my  God,  whom  I  see  preparing 
me  for  the  better  conclusion  of  all  my  afflictions  and 
adversities. 

"  This  will  be  to  you  [a  monition]  to  discharge 


350  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

your  conscience  toward  my  child,  as  to  what  belongs 
to  him  on  this  point  after  my  death;  and,  in  the 
meantime,  not  to  let  prevail  to  his  prejudice,  the  con- 
tinual practices  and  secret  conspiracies  which  our 
enemies  in  this  kingdom  are  making  daily  for  the  ad- 
vancement of  their  said  pretensions ;  laboring,  on  the 
other  side,  with  our  traitorous  subjects  in  Scotland, 
by  all  the  means  which  they  can  to  hasten  his  ruin ; 
of  which  I  desire  no  better  verification  than  the 
charges  given  to  your  last  deputies  sent  into  Scotland, 
and  what  the  said  deputies  have  seditiously  practiced 
there,  as  I  believe,  without  your  knowledge,  but  with 
good  and  sufficient  solicitation  of  the  earl,  my  good 
neighbor  at  York.* 

"  And  on  this  point,  madam,  by  what  right  can  it 
l&gt;e  maintained  that  I,  the  mother  of  my  child,  am  to- 
tally prohibited  not  only  from  assisting  him  in  the  so 
urgent  necessity  in  which  he  is,  but  also  from  having 
any  intelligence  of  his  state?  Who  can  bring  him 
more  carefulness,  duty,  and  sincerity  than  I  ?  To 
whom  can  he  be  more  near  ?  At  the  least,  if,  when 
sending  to  him  to  provide  for  his  preservation,  as  the 
Earl  of  Cheresbury  [Shrewsbury]  gave  me  lately  to 
understand  that  you  did,  you  had  been  pleased  to 
take  my  advice  in  the  matter,  you  would  have  inter- 
]H»sod  with  a  better  face,  as  I  think,  and  with  more 
obligingness  to  me.  But  consider  what  you  leave  me 
to  think,  when,  forgetting  so  suddenly  the  offence 
which  you  pretended  to  have  taken  against  my  son, 
at  tho  time  T  was  requesting  you  that  we  should  send 
together  to  him,  you  have  dispatched  one  to  the  place 
whero  ho  was  a  prisoner,  not  only  without  giving  me

MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  351 

advice  of  it,  but  debarring  me  at  the  very  time  from 
all  liberty,  that  by  no  way  whatever  I  might  have 
any  news  of  him. 

"  And  if  the  intention  of  those  who  have  procured 
on  your  part  this  so  prompt  visit  to  my  son  had  been 
for  his  preservation  and  the  repose  of  the  country, 
they  needed  not  to  have  been  so  careful  to  conceal  it 
from  me,  as  a  matter  in  which  I  should  not  have  been 
willing  to  concur  with  you.  By  this  means  they  have 
lost  you  the  good  will  which  I  should  have  had 
for  you.  And,  to  talk  to  you  more  plainly  on  the 
point,  I  pray  you  not  to  employ  there  any  more  such 
means  or  such  persons.  For,  although  I  hold  the  Lord 
de  Kerri  [Gary,  Lord  Hundson]  too  sensible  of  the 
rank  from  which  he  is  sprung,  to  engage  his  honor  in 
a  villainous  act,  yet  he  has  had  for  an  assistant  a 
sworn  partizan  of  the  Earl  of  Huntingdon's,  by  whose 
bad  offices  an  action  as  bad  has  nearly  succeeded  to  a 
similar  effect.  I  shall  be  contented,  then,  if  you  will 
only  not  permit  my  son  to  receive  any  injury  from  his 
country  (which  is  all  that  I  have  ever  required  of  you 
before,  even  when  an  army  was  sent  to  the  borders,  to 
prevent  justice  from  being  done  to  that  detestable 
Morton,)  nor  any  of  your  subjects  to  intermeddle  any 
more,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  the  affairs  of  Scot- 
land, unless  with  my  knowledge,  to  whom  all  cog- 
nizance of  these  things  belongs,  or  with  the  assistance 
of  some  one  on  the  part  of  the  most  Christian  King, 
my  good  brother,  whom,  as  our  principal  ally,  I  desire 
to  make  privy  to  the  whole  of  this  cause,  notwith- 
standing the  little  influence  that  he  can  have  with  the 
traitors  who  detain  my  son  at  present. 

"  In  the  meantime,  I  declare  in  all  frankness  to 


M  \l;V  &lt;t&gt;i   i.KN  OF  SCOTS. 

you,  that  I  hold  this  last  conspiracy  and  innovation 
as  pure  treason  against  the  life  of  my  son,  the  good 
of  his  affairs,  and  that  of  the  country ;  and  that,  while 
he  shall  be  in  the  state  which  I  understand  he  is,  I 
shall  consider  no  message,  writing,  or  other  act  that 
comes  from  him,  or  is  passed  in  his  name,  as  proceed- 
ing from  his  free  and  voluntary  disposition,  but  only 
from  the  said  conspirators,  who  are  making  him  serve 
as  a  mask  for  them,  at  the  risk  of  his  life. 

"  But,  madam,  with  all  this  freedom  of  speech, 
which  I  can  foresee  will  in  some  sort  displease  you, 
though  it  is  but  the  truth  itself,  you  will  think  it  still 
more  strange,  I  am  sure,  that  I  im|x&gt;rtune  you  again 
with  a  request  of  much  greater  importance,  and  yet 
very  easy  for  you  to  grant.  This  is,  that,  not  having 
been  able  hitherto  by  accommodating  myself  pa- 
tiently for  so  long  a  time  to  the  rigorous  treatment  of 
this  captivity,  and,  carrying  myself  sincerely  in  all 
things,  yea,  even  such  as  could  concern  you  ever  80 
little,  in  order  to  give  some  assurance  of  my  entire 
affection  for  you,  all  my  hope  being  taken  away  of 
being  better  treated  for  the  very  short  period  of  my 
life  that  remains  to  me,  I  supplicate  you  for  the  sake 
of  the  painful  passion  of  our  Saviour  and  Redeemer, 
Jesus  Christ,  again  I  supplicate  you,  to  permit  me 
to  withdraw  myself  out  of  your  realm,  into  some 
place  of  repose,  to  seek  some  comfort  for  my  poor 
body,  worn  out  as  it  is  with  continual  sorrows,  that, 
with  liberty  of  conscience,  I  may  prepare  my  soul 
for  God,  who  is  daily  calling  for  it. 

"  Believe,  madam,  and  the  physicians  whom  you 
sput  this  last  summer  are  able  sufficiently  to  judge 
the  same,  that  I  am  not  for  a  long  continuance,  so  as 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  353 

to  give  you  any  foundation  for  jealousy  or  distrust  of 
me.  And,  notwithstanding  this,  require  of  me  what- 
ever just  and  reasonable  assurances  and  conditions 
you  think  fit.  The  greatest  power  rests  always  on 
your  side,  to  make  me  keep  them;  though  on 
no  account  whatsoever  would  I  wish  to  break  them. 
You  have  had  sufficient  experience  of  my  observance 
of  my  simple  promises,  and  sometimes  to  my  preju- 
dice; as  I  showed  you  on  this  very  point  about  two 
years  ago.  Recollect,  if  you  please,  what  I  then 
wrote  to  you;  and  if  you  will  never  be  able  to  bind 
my  heart  to  you  so  much  as  by  kindness,  though  you 
keep  my  poor  body  languishing  forever  between  four 
walls ;  those  of  my  rank  and  nature  not  suffering 
themselves  to  be  gained  or  forced  by  any  rigor. 

"  Your  imprisonment,  without  any  right  or  just 
ground,  has  already  destroyed  my  body,  of  which  you 
will  shortly  see  the  end,  if  it  continues  there  a  little 
longer ;  and  my  enemies  will  not  have  much  time  to 
glut  their  cruelty  on  me;  nothing  is  left  of  me  but 
the  soul,  which  all  your  power  cannot  make  captive. 
Give  it,  then,  room  to  aspire  a  little  more  freely  after 
its  salvation,  which  is  all  that  it  now  seeks,  rather 
than  any  grandeur  of  this  world.  It  seems  to  me 
that  it  cannot  be  any  great  satisfaction,  honor,  and 
advantage  to  you,  for  my  enemies  to  trample  my  life 
under  foot,  till  they  have  stifled  me  in  your  presence. 
Whereas,  if,  in  this  extremity,  however  late  it  be,  you 
release  me  out  of  their  hands,  you  will  bind  me 
strongly  to  you,  and  bind  all  those  who  belong  to  me, 
particularly  my  poor  child,  whom  you  will,  perhaps, 
make  sure  to  yourself  by  it. 

"  I  will  not  cease  to  importune  you  with  this  re-

t,  till  it  is  granted.  And  on  this  account  I  beg 
you  to  let  me  know  your  intention  ;  having,  in  order 
to  comply  with  you,  delayed  for  two  years  till  this 
time  to  renew  ray  application  for  it.  In  the  mean- 
time, provide,  if  you  please,  for  the  bettering  of  my 
treatment  in  this  country,  that  I  may  not  suffer  any 
longer,  and  commit  me  not  to  the  discretion  of  any 
other  whatever,  but  only  your  own  self,  from  wh«»m 
alone,  (as  I  wrote  to  you  lately,)  I  wish  for  the  fu- 
ture to  derive  all  the  good  and  the  evil  which  I  shall 
experience  in  your  dominions.  Do  me  this  favor, 
to  let  me,  or  the  ambassador  of  France  for  me,  have 
your  intention  in  writing.  For,  to  confine  me  to 
what  the  Earl  of  Scherusbury  [Shrewsbury]  or 
others  shall  say  or  write  about  it  on  your  behalf,  I 
have  too  much  experience  to  be  able  to  put  any  assur- 
ance in  it;  the  least  point  which  they  shall  capri- 
ciously fancy  being  sufficient  to  make  a  total  change 
from  one  day  to  another. 

"  Besides  this,  the  last  time  I  wrote  to  those  of 
your  council,  you  gave  me  to  understand  that  I  ought 
not  to  address  myself  to  them,  but  to  you  alone; 
therefore,  to  extend  their  authority  and  credit  only 
to  do  me  hurt,  could  not  be  reasonable;  as  has  hap- 
pened in  this  last  limitation,  in  which,  contrary  to 
your  intentions,  I  have  been  treated  with  much  indig- 
nity. This  gives  me  every  reason  to  suspect  that 
some  of  my  enemies  in  your  said  council  may  have 
procured  it  with  a  design  to  keep  others  of  the  said 
council  from  being  made  privy  to  my  just  complaints, 
lost  the  others  should  perhaps  see  their  companions 
adhere  to  their  wicked  attempts  upon  my  life,  which, 
if  they  should  have  any  knowledge  of  thnu,  they 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  355 

would  oppose,  for  the  sake  of  your  honor  and  of  their 
duty  towards  you. 

"  Two  things  I  have  principally  to  require  at  the 
close:  the  one,  that,  near  as  I  am  to  leaving  this 
world,  I  may  have  with  me  for  my  consolation  some 
honest  churchman,  to  remind  me  daily  of  the  course 
which  I  have  to  finish,  and  to  teach  me  Irow  to  com- 
plete it  conformably  with  my  religion,  in  which  I  am 
firmly  resolved  to  live  and  die. 

"  This  is  a  last  duty,  which  cannot  be  denied  the 
meanest  and  most  abject  person  that  lives:  it  is  a 
liberty  which  you  grant  to  all  the  foreign  ambassa-* 
dors,  and  which  all  Catholic  Kings  give  to  your  am- 
bassadors— the  exercise  of  their  religion.  And  even 
I  myself  have  not  heretofore  forced  my  own  subjects 
to  anything  contrary  to  their  religion,  though  I  had 
all  power  and  authority  over  them.  And  that  I 
should  be  deprived  in  this  extremity  of  such  freedom, 
you  cannot  in  justice  require.  What  advantage  will 
accrue  to  you  if  you  deny  it  me  ?  I  hope  that  God 
will  forgive  me,  if,  oppressed  by  you  in  this  manner, 
I  render  him  no  other  duty  than  what  I  shall  be  al- 
lowed to  do  in  my  heart.  But  you  will  set  a  very 
bad  example  to  the  other  princes  of  Christendom,  to 
act  towards  their  subjects  with  the  same  rigor  that 
you  will  show  to  me,  a  sovereign  Queen,  and  your 
nearest  relation,  which  I  am,  and  shall  be,  as  long  as 
I  live,  in  spite  of  my  enemies. 

"  I  would  not  now  trouble  you  with  the  increase  of 
my  household ;  about  which,  for  the  short  time  I  have 
to  live,  I  need  not  care  much.  I  require  then  from 
you  only  two  bedchamber  women  to  attend  me  during 
my  illness;  attesting  to  you  before  God,  that  they 


MAF^    &lt;('i   I  l\    CM    -»  OTS. 

arc  very  necessary  to  me,  MM\V  that  I  am  a  forlorn 
•Mire  among  the.-e  simple  people,  (irant  these  to 
me,  for  &lt;lod'-  ~;ike;  and  &gt;how,  iu  tin-  instance,  that 
my  enemies  have  not  so  much  credit  with  you  against 
me  as  to  exercise  their  vengeance  and  cruelty  in  a 
]M&gt;int  of  so  little  imjHuMance,  and  involving  a  n 
•  •Mice  of  humanity. 

''I  will  now  come  to  that  with  which  the  Karl  of 
Shrewsbury  has  charged  me,  if  such  a  one  as  he  can 
charge  me,  which  is  this:  that,  contrary  to  my  prom- 
i-e  made  to  Beal,  and  without  your  knowledge,  I  liave 
been  negotiating  with  my  son,  to  yield  to  him  my 
title  to  the  crown  of  Scotland,  when  I  had  obliged 
myself  not  to  proceed  in  it  but  with  your  advice,  by 
one  of  my  servants,  who  should  be  directed  by  one 
of  yours  in  their  common  joijrncy  thither.  These  are, 
I  believe,  the  very  words  of  the  said  earl. 

"  I  will  tell  you,  madam,  that  Beal  never  had  an 
absolute  and  unconditional  promise  from  me,  but,  in- 
deed, conditional  overtures,  by  which  I  cannot  be 
bound,  in  the  state  in  which  the  business  is,  unless  the 
stipulations  which  I  annexed  to  it  are  previously  exe- 
cuted ;  and  so  far  is  he  from  having  satisfied  me  about 
this,  that,  on  the  contrary,  I  have  never  had  any  an- 
swer from  him,  nor  heard  mention  of  it  since,  on  his 
part.  And  on  this  point,  I  well  rememl&gt;er,  that  the 
Earl  of  Shrewsbury,  about  Easter  last,  wishing  to 
draw  from  me  a  now  confirmation  of  what  I  had 
spoken  to  the  said  Beal,  I  replied  to  him  very  fully, 
that  it  was  only  in  case  the  said  conditions  should  be 
granted,  and  &lt;-»ii-.e&lt;|ucntlv  fulfilled  toward  mo.  Both 
aro  living  to  testify  this,  if  they  will  tell  the  truth 
about  it.  Then.  .-reing  that  no  answer  was  made  to 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.         357 

me,  but  on  the  contrary,  that  by  delays  and  neglects 
my  enemies  continued  more  licentiously  than  ever 
their  practices  carried  on  ever  since  the  sojourn  of 
the  said  Beal  with  me,  in  order  to  thwart  my  just 
pretensions  in  Scotland,  so  that  the  effects  have  been 
well  witnessed  there ;  by  these  means  a  door  was  left 
open  for  the  ruin  of  myself  and  son ;  I  took  your  si- 
lence for  a  refusal,  and  discharged  myself,  by  express 
letters,  as  well  to  you  as  to  your  council,  from  all  that 
I  had  treated  upon  with  the  said  Beal. 

"  I  make  you  fully  privy  to  what  monsieur,  the 
King,  and  madame,  the  Queen,  had  written  to  me 
with  their  own  hands,  on  this  business,  and  I  asked 
your  advice  upon  it,  which  is  yet  to  come,  and  on 
which  it  was  in  truth  my  intention  to  proceed,  if  you 
had  given  it  me  in  time)  and  you  had  permitted  me 
to  send  to  my  son,  assisting  me  in  the  overtures  which 
I  had  proposed  to  you,  in  order  to  establish  between 
the  two  realms  a  good  amity  and  perfect  intelligence 
for  the  future.  But  to  bind  myself  nakedly  to  fol- 
low your  advice  before  I  knew  what  it  would  be,  and, 
for  the  journey  of  our  servants,  to  put  mine  under  the 
direction  of  yours,  even  to  my  own  country,  I  was 
never  yet  so  simple  as  to  think  of  it. 

"  Now  I  refer  to  your  consideration,  if  you  knew 
of  the  false  game  which  my  enemies  in  this  country 
have  played  me  in  Scotland,  to  reduce  things  to  the 
point  at  which  they  stand,  which  of  us  has  proceeded 
with  the  greatest  sincerity.  God  judge  between  them 
and  me,  and  avert  from  this  island  the  just  punish- 
ment of  their  demerits! 

"  Take  no  heed  of  the  intelligence  which  my  trai- 
torous subjects  in  Scotland  have  given  you.  You  will 


358  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

find,  and  I  will  maintain  it  before  nil  tin-  princes  in 
Christendom,  that  nothing  whatever  has  passed  there 
on  my  side  to  your  prejudice,  or  against  the  welfare 
and  tranquillity  of  the  realm,  which  I  affect  not  less 
than  any  counselor  or  subject  that  you  have,  being 
more  interested  in  it  than  any  of  them. 

"  There  was  a  negotiation  for  gratifying  my  son 
with  the  title  and  name  of  King,  and  for  insuring 
as  well  the  said  title  to  him  as  impunity  to  the  rebels 
for  their  past  offences,  and  for  replacing  everything 
in  repose  and  tranquillity  for  the  future,  without  in- 
novation of  any  kind  whatever.  Was  this  taking 
away  the  crown  from  my  son  ?  My  enemies,  I  be- 
lieve, had  no  wish  whatever  that  the  crown  should  be 
secured  to  him,  and  are  therefore  glad  that  he  should 
keep  it  by  the  unlawful  violence  of  traitors,  enemies 
from  times  of  old  to  all  our  family.  Was  this  then 
seeking  for  justice  upon  the  past  offences  of  the  said 
traitors,  which  my  clemency  has  always  surpassed  ? 

"  But  an  evil  conscience  can  never  be  assured,  car- 
rying its  fear  continually  in  its  very  great  trouble 
within  itself.  Was  it  wishing  to  disturb  the  repose 
of  the  country  to  grant  a  mild  pardon  of  everything 
past,  and  to  effect  a  general  reconciliation  between 
all  our  subjects?  This  is  the  point  which  our  ene- 
mies in  this  country  are  afraid  of,  much  as  they  pre- 
tend to  desire  it.  What  prejudice  would  be  done  to 
you  by  this  ?  Mark  then,  and  verify,  if  you  please, 
by  what  other  point.  I  will  answer  it  on  my  honor. 

"  Ah !  will  you,  madam,  suffer  yourself  to  be  so 
blind  to  the  artifices  of  my  enemies,  as  to  establish 
their  unjust  pretensions  to  this  crown,  after  you  are 
gone;  nay,  perhaps,  against  yourself?  Will  you  suf- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  359 

fer  them  in  your  lifetime,  and  look  on,  while  they 
are  ruining  and  cruelly  destroying  those  so  nearly 
connected  with  you,  both  in  heart  and  in  blood? 
What  advantage  and  honor  can  you  hope  for  in  allow- 
ing them  to  keep  us,  my  son  and  me,  so  long  sepa- 
rated, and  him  and  me  from  you  ? 

"  Redeem  the  old  pledges  of  your  good-nature ; 
bind  your  relations  to  yourself ;  let  me  have  the  satis- 
faction, before  I  die,  of  seeing  all  matters  happily 
settled  between  us ;  that  my  soul,  when  released  from 
this  body,  may  not  be  constrained  to  make  its  lamen- 
tations to  God  for  the  wrongs  which  you  have  suffered 
to  be  done  it  here  below ;  but  rather  that,  being  hap- 
pily united  to  you,  it  may  quit  this  captivity,  to  go  to 
Him,  whom  I  pray  to  inspire  you  favorably  upon  my 
very  just,  and  more  than  reasonable  complaints  and 
grievances.  At  Sheffield,  this  8th  of  November,  one

and  affectionate  cousin, 

"  MAEY  R." 

The  Queen  of  England  was  far  from  yielding  to 
the  captive's  pleading.  Recent  events  had  decided 
her  to  keep  Mary  in  secure  confinement,  where,  as 
hitherto,  failure  should  be  the  issue  of  all  plots, 
against  her  own  majesty,  and  in  behalf  of  her  rival. 
In  poor  Scotland,  revolutions  swept  over  the  land, 
like  the  waves  of  a  tempestuous  deep.  James  VI. 
was  young  and  weak,  both  in  council  and  action.  He 
entertained  no  ardent  affection  for  his  mother,  con- 
sequently had  not  imbibed  her  ambitious  hostility  to 


360  MARY  yrKEX  OF  SCOTS. 

Elizabeth.  Ho  was  the  creature  of  popular  commo- 
tion, and  capricious  attachments  to  political  favorites. 
Meanwhile,  Philip  II.  and  the  Duke  of  Guise  deter- 
mined to  invade  England,  with  a  bold  and  decisive 
campaign.  June  27th,  1583,  James,  by  the  assist- 
ance of  Earl  Huntley  and  others,  regained  his  free- 
dom, and  was  prepared  for  the  adventure. 

The  Duke  of  Guise  sent  Charles  Paget,  under  the 
assumed  name  of  Mapo,  who  was  one  of  the  man- 
agers of  Mary's  dowry  in  France,  to  the  English 
Catholics  with  this  message: 

"  Assure  them,  upon  the  faith  and  honor  of  Her- 
cules (the  Duke  of  Guise,)  that  the  enterprise  has  no 
other  object  than  the  establishment  of  the  Catholic 
religion  in  England,  and  the  peaceable  restitution  of 
the  crown  of  England  to  the  Queen  of  Scotland,  to 
whom  that  crown  of  right  belongs.  As  soon  as  this 
is  done,  all  foreigners  shall  leave  the  kingdom,  and  if 
any  refuse  to  do  so,  Hercules  promises  to  join  his 
forces  to  those  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  country,  in 
order  to  drive  them  out." 

The  grand  expedition  was  doomed  to  inglorious 
close,  like  every  movement  which  had  been  made  for 
the  imprisoned  Queen.  Elizabeth's  counsellors  dis- 
covered the  scheme,  and  the  result  was  a  fiercer  cru- 
sade upon  Catholicism,  and  greater  vigilance  over 
Mary  Stuart.  The  English  Parliament  convened, 
and  aroused  by  the  late  designs  upon  Elizabeth  and 
the  realm.  j&gt;a~«'&lt;l  n  bill,  depriving  Mary  Stuart  and 
all  her  denencUmta  of  the  right  of  succession,  if  tin- 
sovereign  of  Knjrlaixl  met  a  violent  death,  and  author- 
izing the  pursuit  and  execution  of  any  person  found 
privy  to  the  conspiracy,  before  a  jury  of  twenty-four 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  361 

commissioners.  Parliament  also  enacted,  "  the  pen- 
alties of  high  treason  against  the  English  Catholic 
priest,  ordained  by  the  Bishop  of  Rome,  who  was 
found  in  the  realm  after  the  expiration  of  forty  days ; 
attainted  with  felony  all  persons  who  should  receive 
or  assist  him ;  punished  with  fine  and  imprisonment, 
at  the  Queen's  pleasure,  all  who  knew  of  his  being  in 
the  kingdom,  and  did  not  denounce  him  within  twelve 
days;  ordered  that  all  students  in  Catholic  seminaries 
abroad,  who  did  not  return  to  England  within  six 
months  after  proclamation  to  that  effect,  should  be 
punished  as  traitors ;  that  parents  sending  their  chil- 
dren abroad  without  license,  should  forfeit  for  every 
such  offence  one  hundred  pounds;  and  that  children 
so  sent  to  seminaries,  should  be  disabled  from  inher- 
iting the  property  of  their  parents." 

Mary  discerned  in  these  statutes  the  shadows  of 
her  hastening  fate.  She  was  removed,  August  25th, 
1584,  from  Sheffield  to  Wingfield  Castle.  She  signed 
a  declaration  in  sentiment  the  same  as  that  of  the 
combination  to  protect  the  rights  of  Elizabeth.  Jan- 
uary 5th,  1585,  she  wrote  to  the  Archbishop  of  Glas- 
gow, that  she  desired  to  secure  peace  for  the  Queen 
of  England,  power  for  James  VI.,  and  freedom  for 
herself. 

She  finally  submitted  with  great  reluctance  to  the 
will  of  Sir  Ralph  Sadler,  and  his  son-in-law,  Somers, 
her  new  keepers,  and  was  transferred  from  Wingfield 
to  the  cold  and  gloomy  apartments  of  Tutbury  Cas- 
tle. A  letter  to  Mauvissiere  and  Chasteauneuf, 
jointly  gives  minutely  a  narrative  of  her  cheerless 
captivity :

"  Gentlemen,  foreseeing  that  your  answer  to  my 
last  will  be  some  time  before  it  reaches  me,  I  have 
thought  it  best,  without  waiting  for  it,  to  impart  to 
you  my  just  complaints  concerning  what  Sir  Amyas 
has  been  directed  to  signify  to  me,  touching  the  me- 
morial which  I  have  sent  you,  which  amounts,  in  fact, 
to  an  absolute  refusal  of  the  principal  request  con- 
tained in  it,  namely,  those  relating  to  the  change  and 
conveniences  of  dwelling,  intelligence  concerning  the 
affairs  of  my  dowry  by  the  Sieur  de  Cherelles,  and 
the  increase  of  the  number  of  my  servants — things, 
though  trifling  and  of  no  importance  to  the  Queen  of 
England,  madam  my  good  sister,  yet  so  necessary  for 
the  preservation  of  my  life  and  health,  so  mainly  con- 
tributing to  the  few  comforts  that  are  left  to  me  in 
this  world,  and  to  my  consolation  between  these  four 
walls  (where  I  perceive  more  clearly  from  day  to 
day  that  they  are  determined  to  reduce  me  to  the  last 
extremity)  that,  but  for  the  very  urgent  need  I  have 
of  them,  I  should  not  have  stooped  to  beg  for  them 
with  such  earnest  and  persevering  supplications,  that 
I  think  I  could  not  have  bought  them  at  a  dearer 
rate ;  regretting  exceedingly  that,  for  all  the  duty  I 
have  imposed  upon  myself  to  please  the  said  Queen  in 
every  thing  and  in  every  place,  so  little  consideration 
and  respect  is  paid  to  my  honor  and  content  in  the 
matter  of  my  state  and  treatment  here. 

"  To  give  you,  then,  ocular  proof  of  the  situation 
in  which  I  find  myself  in  regard  to  the  dwelling  in 
the  first  place,  and  that  you  may  remonstrate  in  my 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  363 

behalf  on  the  subject  with  the  said  Queen,  (who,  I 
presume,  has  never  been  accurately  informed  about 
it,)  I  will  tell  you  that  I  am  in  a  walled  enclosure,  on 
the  top  of  a  hill,  exposed  to  all  the  winds  and  the  in- 
clemencies of  heaven ;  within  the  said  enclosure,  re- 
sembling that  of  the  wood  of  Vincennes,  there  is  a 
very  old  hunting-lodge,  built  of  timber  and  plaster, 
cracked  in  all  parts,  the  plaster  adhering  nowhere  to 
the  woodwork,  and  broken  in  numberless  places;  the 
said  lodge  distant  three  fathoms  or  thereabouts  from 
the  wall,  and  situated  so  low,  that  the  rampart  of 
earth  which  is  behind  the  wall  is  on  a  level  with  the 
highest  point  of  the  building,  so  that  the  sun  can 
never  shine  upon  it  on  that  side,  nor  any  fresh  air 
come  to  it ;  for  which  reason  it  is  so  damp,  that  you 
cannot  put  any  piece  of  furniture  in  that  part  without 
its  being  in  four  days  completely  covered  with  mould. 
I  leave  you  to  think  how  this  must  act  upon  the  hu- 
man body;  and,  in  short,  the  greater  part  of  it  is 
rather  a  dungeon  for  base  and  abject  criminals,  than 
a  habitation  fit  for  a  person  of  my  quality,  or  even  of 
a  much  lower.  I  am  sure  that  there  is  not  a  noble- 
man in  this  kingdom,  nor  even  one  of  those  who, 
being  inferior  to  noblemen,  wish  to  reduce  me  beneath 
themselves,  who  would  not  deem  it  a  tyrannical  pun- 1 
ishment  to  be  obliged  to  live  for  a  year  in  so  straight- 
ened and  inconvenient  a  habitation,  as  they  want  to 
force  and  constrain  me  to  do;  and  the  only  apart- 
ments that  I  have  for  my  own  person,  consist — and 
for  the  truth  of  this,  I  can  appeal  to  all  those  who 
have  been  here — of  two  little,  miserable  rooms,  so  ex- 
cessively cold,  especially  at  night,  that  but  for  the 
ramparts  and  entrenchments  of  curtains  of  tapestry

which  1  have  made  here,  it  would  not  be  possible  for 
me  to  stav  in  tin-in  in  the  day-time;  and  unt  of  those 
who  have  sat  uj&gt;  with  me  at  niirht  during  my  illness, 
scarcely  one  has  esca])ed  without  fluxion,  or  cold,  or 
.some  disorder.  Sir  Ainyas  can  bear  witness  that  he 
has  seen  three  of  my  women  ill  at  once  from  this 
cause  alone;  and  my  physician  himself,  who  has  had 
his  share  of  it,  has  seveml  times  jH&gt;&gt;itively  declared 
that  he  will  not  take  charge  of  my  health  during  the 
next  winter,  if  I  am  to  remain  in  this  house.  As  for 
replastering  or  in  any  way  repairing  or  enlarging  it, 
you  may  conceive  how  wholesome  it  would  be  for  me 
to  live  in  such  new  pieces  of  patchwork,  when  I  can- 
jiot  endure  the  least  breath  of  damp  air  in  the  world; 
and  on  this  account  it  is  of  no  use  whatever  to  offer 
me  to  make  any  repairs  or  any  new  conveniences 
against  the  winter.  As  for  the  house  to  which  it  is  pro- 
posed that  I  should  remove  during  the  said  repairs, 
it  is  a  building  attached,  as  it  were,  to  this;  and  my 
keeper  can  testify  that  it  is  not  in  his  power  to  lodge 
the  few  servants  I  have;  and,  without  them,  I  have 
too  many  reasons  to  be  afraid  of  living  thus  apart, 
wherefore, at  this  time,!  will  say  no  more.  If  I  must 
proceed  to  inconveniences,  I  have  not,  as  I  heretofore 
informed  you,  any  gallery  or  cabinet,  to  retire  to  oc- 
casionally alone,  excepting  two  paltry  holes,  with 
windows  facing  the  dark,  surrounding  wall,  and  the 
largest  of  them  not  above  a  fathom  and  a  half  square. 
For  taking  the  air  abroad,  on  foot,  or  in  my  eh: 
(there  being  no  vacant  spot  on  the  top  of  the  hill,)  I 
have  only  about  a  quarter  of  an  acre  of  ground,  con- 
tiguous to  the  stables,  which  Smmner  bad  dug  up  last 
winter,  and  enclosed  with  a  fence  of  dry  wood;  a 


MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS. 

place,  to  look  at,-  fitter  to  keep  pigs  in,  than  to  bear  the 
name  of  garden ;  there  is  not  a  sheep-pen  amid  the 
fields  but  makes  a  better  appearance. 

"As  for  taking  exercise  on  horseback,  during  the 
whole  winter,  as  I  experienced,  sometimes  snow,  some- 
times rain,  break  up  the  roads  in  such  a  manner,  that 
there  is  no  house  containing  so  many  people  of  the 
lower  sort  as  this  does,  which  can  be  kept  clean  long, 
whatever  pains  may  be  taken  with  it.  Then,  again, 
this  house,  having  no  drains  to  the  privies,  is  subject 
to  a  continual  stench ;  and  every  Saturday  they  are 
obliged  to  empty  them  and  the  one  beneath  my  win- 
dows, from  which  I  receive  a  perfume  not  the  most 
agreeable.  And  if,  to  the  above,  I  may  be  permitted 
the  opinion  which  I  have  conceived  of  this  house,  a 
thing  to  be  considered  in  the  case  of  persons  inferior 
in  station  to  me  when  in  ill  health,  I  will  say,  that  as 
this  house  has  been  my  first  prison  and  place  of  con- 
finement in  this  kingdom,  where,  from  the  first,  I 
have  been  treated  with  a  great  harshness,  rudeness, 
and  indignity,  so  have  I  always  held  it  since  to  be 
unlucky  and  unfortunate,  as  last  winter,  before  com- 
ing hither,  I  caused  to  be  represented  to  the  said 
Queen  of  England ;  and  in  this  sinister  opinion  I  have 
been  not  a  little  confirmed  by  the  accident  of  the 
priest,  who,  after  having  been  grievously  tormented, 
was  found  hanging  from  the  wall  opposite  to  my  win- 
dows,* about  which  I  wrote  to  you,  Monsieur  de  Mau- 

*  The  Catholic  priest  here  mentioned  had  been  persecuted 
on  account  of  his  religion  ;  and,  to  escape  further  hardships, 
he  hung  himself  in  the  manner  described  by  Mary,  who,  on 
the  occasion,  addressed  to  Elizabeth  an  eloquent  letter  on 
the  duty  of  permitting  toleration,  which  is  to  be  found  in 
Laboureur's  work.

;  and  thru,  four  or  five  days  afterward,  an- 
other ]&gt;oor  man  was  found  who  had  tumbled  into  the 
well  ;  but  this  I  did  not  mean  to  compare  with  the 
other.  Then  I  have  lost  my  good  Kallay,  who  was 
one  of  the  chief  consolations  of  my  captivity  ;  another 
of  my  servants  is  since  dead,  and  several  more  have 
been  sorely  troubled  with  i  linen. 

"  So  I  cannot  have  any  convenience  or  enjoyment 
here;  and,  but  for  the  express  assurances  which  the 
said  Queen,  my  good  sister,  gave  me,  of  honorable 
treatment,  and  which  caused  me  to  wait  for  it  with 
patience  till  now,  I  never  would  have  set  foot  in  thi.n 
place;  sooner  should  they  have  dragged  me  to  it  by 
force,  as  I  now  protest  that  nothing  but  the  force  of 
constraint  makes  me  stay  here,  and  that,  in  case  my 
life  should  be  cut  short  by  illness,  from  this  time,  I 
impute  it  to  the  deficiency  of  my  dwelling,  and  to 
those  who  are  determined  to  keep  me  there,  with  the 
intention,  it  would  seem,  to  make  me  wholly  despair 
for  the  future  of  the  good  will  of  the  said  Queen,  my 
good  sister,  in  matters  of  importance;  since,  in  such 
reasonable,  ordinary  wants,  I  am  so  ill-used  and  prom- 
ises made  to  me  are  not  kept.  To  allege  that  the  sea- 
son of  the  year  is  already  too  far  advanced,  and  the 
time  too  short  to  provide  a  new  habitation  for  me,  a? 
if  I  had  not  long  ago  made  remonstrances  on  the  sub- 
ject, is  to  forget  that,  at  the  time  my  secretary  was 
there,  he  sjx&gt;ke  about  it  very  urgently  to  the  Queen, 
my  good  sister,  and  left  a  memorial,  at  his  departure, 
for  Mr.  \Vjilsyngham.  Since  then,  the  point  has 
l&gt;ecn  urged  anew  by  Sommer,  as  well  as  by  a  message 
from  my  own  li|&gt;s,  as  by  a  memorial  which  was 
given  to  him,  whereupon,  I  am  told  that  the  memorial 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  367 

was  delivered  to  you,  Mr.  de  Mauvissicre,  and  that 
the  fault  lies  in  your  not  having  followed  it  up ;  nev- 
ertheless, I  have  written  to  you  several  times,  and 
myself  solicited  Sir  Amyas  about  it,  so  that  no 
trouble  has  been  spared  on  that  head. 

"  As  to  the  inconveniences  of  removal  at  this  sea- 
son, and  for  the  provisions  requisite  to  be  made,  they 
did  not  stand  last  year  upon  such  ceremony,  when 
they  obliged  me  to  leave  Sheffield  for  Winkfield,  and 
Winkfield  for  this  place,  in  the  depth  of  winter,  when 
I  was  scarcely  able  to  turn  in  bed,  which  I  had  kept 
for  nearly  three  months  before.  This  house,  which 
had  not  been  inhabited  for  the  space  of  fifteen  or  six- 
teen years,  was,  at  that  time,  prepared  in  less  than 
five  weeks,  and,  such  as  it  was,  they  lost  no  time  in 
bringing  me  to  it,  no  matter  whether  with  or  without 
my  consent.  However,  I  affectionately  beg  you  both 
to  insist  more  urgently  and  perseveringly  than  ever, 
in  the  name  of  the  King,  monsieur  my  good  brother, 
and  on  my  own  behalf,  on  my  removal  from  this  house 
and  the  conveniences  which,  from  the  foregoing,  you 
may  judge  necessary  in  the  new  one  that  shall  be 
appointed  for  me;  and  do  not  be  put  off,  if  you 
please,  with  excuses,  evasions,  or  fair  words. that  may 
be  given  you,  if  they  are  not  to  the  effect  that  is  capa- 
ble of  satisfying  and  contenting  me  in  this  matter. 
Insist,  also,  by  all  means,  I  beg  you,  on  permission 
for  the  Sieur  de  Cherelles  to  come  to  me,  reminding 
the  said  Queen,  my  good  sister,  how  she  was  pleased, 
till  last  winter,  to  allow  me  to  have  some  one  over 
every  year  to  give  me  an  account  of  my  affairs,  as  it  is 
very  requisite,  and  more  than  reasonable,  especially 
considering  the  state  in  which  they  are  at  present, 


368  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

from  the  attacks  that  arc  daily  made  upon  my  rights, 
and  the  hindrance  an-l  annoyances  that  are  given  roe 
in  the  enjoyment  «-f  the  little  which  is  left  me  of 
my  dowry,  one-third  of  which,  and  more,  has  already 
been  wrested  from  mr  by  piecemeal;  and  it  is  not  in 
my  power  to  apply  a  remedy,  and  set  things  to  rights, 
unle»  I  can  l&gt;e  minutely  informed  of  the  particulars 
by  some  trusty  person,  who,  it  is  well  known,  would 
not  attempt  to  write  to  me  l»y  letters  which  must  pass 
through  so  many  hands,  neither  would  I  thus  openly 
inform  them  of  my  intentions.  There  is  no  crim- 
inal or  prisoner,  however  mean,  who  is  not  permitted 
to  receive  accounts  of  his  private  affairs,  and  to  man- 
age them  as  he  pleases,  prisons  having  never  been 
designed  for  the  punishment  of  malefactors,  but  only 
for  safe  custody;  and  it  seems,  on  the  contrary,  that, 
as  for  me,  born  a  sovereign  Queen,  who  sought  refuge 
in  this  kingdom  upon  the  assurance  and  promise  of 
friendship,  they  wish  to  make  this  imprisonment 
drive  me  from  affliction  to  the  very  last  extremity, 
as  if  it  were  not  sufficient  that,  after  seventeen  of  the 
best  years  of  my  life  spent  in  such  misery,  I  have 
lost  the  use  of  my  limbs,  and  the  strength  and  health 
of  the  rest  of  my  body,  and  that  various  attacks  have 
been  made  upon  my  honor,  but  they  must  persecute 
me  in  the  bargain,  and  abridge  me  as  much  as  possi- 
ble of  the  property  and  conveniences  yet  left  me  in 
the  world.  Learn,  then,  if  you  please,  gentlemen,  if 
the  Queen,  my  good  sister,  intends  to  treat  me  in 
future  like  a  condemned  criminal,  and  to  keep  me  in 
perpetual  imprisonment,  as  it  would  appear  from  the 
rity  with  which  T  am  used,  without  getting  rid 
of  me  altogether  by  giving  me  my  liberty,  (from 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  369 

which,  agreeably  to  the  conditions  which  I  offered, 
she  would  derive  more  advantage  than  she  ever  will 
from  my  detention  or  death,)  or,  on  the  other  hand, 
affording  me  occasion  to  accommodate  myself  to  her 
satisfaction  in  captivity.  My  requests  are  not  made 
for  pleasure,  but  from  necessity,  not  against  her 
safety,  but  for  her  honor,  and  such,  I  may  say,  as  I 
have  more  than  justly  merited.  What  encourage- 
ment to  do  better  can  it  be  to  me  to  see  myself,  after 
the  entire  voluntary  submission  to  which  I  made  up 
my  mind,  more  harshly  and  rigorously  treated  than 
ever,  and  with  more  demonstration,  in  appearance 
and  reality,  of  ill  will,  suspicion,  and  mistrust. 

"  I  had  more  servants,  when  I  was  with  the  Earl 
of  Shereusbury  than  I  have  now,  when  I  have  more 
need  of  them,  especially  in  my  chamber,  on  account 
of  the  aggravation  of  my  bodily  ailments.  Reckon 
up  those  whom  I  have  discharged,  or  who  have  died 
without  my  having,  as  yet,  any  others  in  their  place, 
and  that  family  of  my  embroiderer  who  is  about  to 
leave  me;  the  number  of  those  whom  I  require  will 
not  be  much  greater,  nor  superior  in  quality,  except- 
ing the  Countess  of  Athol,  for  whom,  also,  I  applied 
as  a  favor,  because  I  had  about  me  here,  in  this  soli- 
tude, as  I  represented,  no  companion  worthy  of  my' 
rank  and  my  age,  which  would  be  highly  proper  and 
suitable.  Seton  and  my  good  Rallay  formerly  sup- 
plied the  want  of  better,  and  I  cannot  imagine  any 
sufficient  reason  for  denying  me  the  said  countess  in 
their  stead,  unless  they  are  fearful  that  she  may  give 
me  some  consolation,  by  bringing  me  tidings  of  my 
son ;  whether  in  this  there  be  any  respect  for  human- 
ity, I  leave  all  those  to  consider,  who  have  really  felt 
24 


370  MARY  gUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

parental  love  for  their  children,  which  ig  the  more 
fervent  in  me,  hecause  my  separation  from  my  son 
is  accompanied  hy  so  rigid  a  prohibition  of  all  com- 
munication between  him  and  me,  that  I  am  debarred 
even  from  hearing  about  his  state  and  health.  I  will 
not  hereupon  call  to  mind  that  the  said  Queen  prom- 
ised me,  last  winter,  that  if  the  answer  of  my  son  to 
the  letter  which  I  was  writing  to  him,  did  not  satisfy 
and  content  me,  I  should  have  permission  to  send  to 
him  again,  and  to  learn  more  precisely  his  intentions 
relative  to  those  matters  which  have  Wn  in  doubt 
between  him  and  me.  Nevertheless,  this  has  hither- 
to been  peremptorily  refused  and  denied  me,  with- 
out consideration  that  such  conduct  tends  to  confirm 
the  intimation  given  me  formerly  by  the  said  Gray, 
that  in  this  quarter  people  were  only  striving  to  pro- 
duce division  and  a  total  separation  between  my  son 
and  me.  With  resjK'ct  to  the  other  servants  whom  I 
have  applied  for,  such  as  Fontenay,  and  Thomas 
Levingston,  I  cannot  discover  any  ground  for  the  re- 
fusal made  me,  unless  it  IK?  that,  as  formerly,  the  said 
Gray,  at  the  time  of  his  journey  to  this  country,  and 
the  Countess  of  Shereusbury  assured  me,  the  right 
way  to  cause  anything  whatever  to  be  denied  me,  was 
to  signify  that  it  would  be  particularly  agreeable  to 
me,  and  then  I  must  never  expect  to  have  it,  but  just 
the  contrary  to  what  I  desired.  They  do  not  ap- 
prove of  my  employing  English,  in  order  to  make  it 
appear  more  plainly  that  I  am  looked  upon  as  an  ab- 
solute foreigner  in  their  country;  at  least  they  ought 
to  allow  me  to  have  my  own  subjects,  or  French  peo- 
ple, such  as  I  like,  and  to  receive  from  their  faithful 
service  some  consolation  between  these  four  walls, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  371 

where,  being  confined  and  watched  so  closely  as  they 
are  accustomed  to  be,  I  know  not  what  just  suspicion 
can  be  conceived  of  them  when  once  shut  up  here. 
However,  I  beg  you  to  make  very  urgent  application 
that  I  may  be  permitted  to  send  for  those  whom  I 
have  demanded,  as  well  from  France  as  from  Scot- 
land, according  to  the  promise  made  to  me  by  the  lips 
of  the  said  Queen,  my  good  sister  herself,  that  I 
should  have  an  increase  and  supply  of  servants;  a 
promise  confirmed  to  my  secretary  by  Mr.  Walsyng- 
ham,  and  since,  in  his  name,  by  Wadde,  having  given 
it  in  writing  to  my  said  secretary,  and  again  by  Sir 
Raff  Sadler  and  Sommer,  when  there,  was  lately  by 
my  present  keeper,  being  assured  in  these  very  words, 
that  I  might  send  to  France  and  Scotland  for  such 
servants  as  I  thought  proper,  but  that  I  must  not 
have  English  on  any  account.  If  they  are  afraid, 
lest,  by  means  of  the  said  servants  whom  I  desire  to 
bring  over  from  France,  I  should  receive  news  of  the 
affairs  of  that  country,  it  is  a  vain  apprehension,  for 
I  have  nothing  wherein  to  intermeddle  there,  and  if 
I  had  any  interest,  it  is  very  certain  that  those  who 
might  be  well  affected  toward  me,  and  have  compas- 
sion on  my  condition  here,  will  not  take  one  step  less, 
either  forward  or  backward,  because  they  are  de- 
prived of  the  means  of  receiving  news  from  me,  and 
I  from  them ;  on  the  contrary,  that  would  spur  them 
on  still  more,  apprehending  the  danger  from  the  death 
to  be  greater  than,  peradventure,  it  is. 

"  This  is,  for  the  present,  what  I  have  to  communi- 
cate to  you  on  the  sudden,  concerning  the  just  dissat- 
isfaction I  feel  on  finding  myself  so  unworthily  used 
and  treated ;  whereof,  hoping,  through  your  favorable 


372  MARY  QUEEN   OF  SCOTS. 

intercessions  and  good  offices,  to  find  some  remedy,  I 
shall  only  apologize  for  having  troubled  you  about 
such  bagatelles,  and  especially  for  being  obliged  to 
make  known  to  you  my  real  state  here,  which  other- 
wise might  IK?  disguised  from  you;  so,  awaiting  your 
answer  about  all  this,  I  pray  God  to  have  you,  gentle- 
men, in  his  holy  and  worthy  keeping.  Written  at

"  Gentlemen,  I  am  ashamed  to  be  under  the  neces- 
sity of  representing  to  you  so  particularly  my  miser- 
able situation  bore,  but  the  evil  presses  me,  and  con- 
strains me  to  declare  it  to  you,  in  order  that  they  may 
not  put  you  off,  yonder,  with  words  without  affording 
me  any  relief,  of  which  I  have  no  hope  whatever, 
since  I  see  nothing  at  this  time  which  tends  to  realize 
that  honorable  treatment  which  has  been  so  much 
talked  of.  Sir  Amyas  had  already  signified  to  me 
the  reply  to  my  memorial,  and  an  hour  ago  I  re- 
ceived your  last,  and  on  considering  both,  I  find,  in 
fact,  no  cause  for  content,  either  in  the  one  or  the 
other,  which  makes  me  entreat  you  more  earnestly 
than  ever,  to  follow  up  the  contents  of  the  above  let- 
ter." 

She  also  addressed  a  memorial  to  Elizabeth,  in 
which  the  following  particulars  confirm  the  state- 
ments above: 

"  That  to  settle  those  matters  which  formerly  led 
to  differences  between  her  and  her  son,  r-lic  may  be 
permitted  to  send  some  one  to  him,  accompanied  by 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  373 

the  French  ambassador,  agreeably  to  the  most  express 
commission  which  he  has  to  this  effect  from  the  King, 
his  master. 

"  That  the  ordinary  communication  which  she  has 
hitherto  had  with  the  said  ambassador  may  be  con- 
tinued; and,  accordingly,  directions  given  for  the 
most  diligent  dispatch  of  their  packets,  as  well  on  the 
one  part  as  on  the  other;  nothing  passing  between 
them  that  can  in  any  way  prove  prejudicial  to  this 
kingdom. 

"  That  her  household  establishment  here  be  deter- 
mined upon  and  fixed;  in  order  that,  as  the  said 
Queen,  her  good  sister,  has  been  pleased  to  assure  her, 
she  may  take  her  into  her  own  keeping,  and  into  her 
own  house:  also,  that  from  her  alone,  she  may  re- 
ceive her  allowance  in  this  country. 

"  That  a  second  house  may  be  granted  her  to  re- 
move to  on  finishing  her  course  of  diet,  or  next  au- 
tumn, at  latest;  it  being  quite  impossible,  without 
great  detriment  to  her  health,  to  live  in  winter  in  the 
two  rooms  which  she  has  here  for  the  whole  of  her 
lodgings,  which  are  built  of  wood,  old,  full  of  holes, 
and  tumbling  down  on  all  sides,  and  having  no  shel- 
tered place  whatever,  to  walk  in  or  retire  to. 

"  That  in  regard  to  the  servants  allowed  her,  and 
that  they  may  not  have  the  trouble  of  traveling  hither 
in  vain,  it  be  declared  whether  she  shall  be  permitted 
to  bring  over  any  she  may  choose,  as  she  might  se- 
lect some  from  the  household  of  Guise,  having  no 
other  acquaintance  in  France  through  whom  to  get 
them. 

"  And  that,  as  for  ordinary  varlets,  her  servants 
may  be  permitted  to  employ  Englishmen,  so  as  to 


374  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

avoid  the  frequent  coming  and  going  of  such  per- 
sons, whom  it  is  difficult  to  retain." 

The  wretched  Mary  was  a  deserted  invalid,  mourn- 
ing over  the  unfilial  conduct  of  Jame-  VI.,  who  had 
entered  upon  a  negotiation,  contemplating  the  alli- 
ance, by  treaty,  of  Scotland  to  England.  She  be- 
came passionately  excited  at  his  course,  and  threat- 
ened to  disown,  disinherit,  and  curse  him;  approving 
any  invasion  of  his  realm  by  foreign  powers.  She 
declared  that  she  had  no  wish  again  to  step  upon  her 
native  soil;  and  asked  only  for  repose  of  body  and 
soul,  before  her  death,  which,  she  was  persuaded, 
would  soon  end  her  captivity. 

Abandoning  the  hope  of  escape,  she  forcibly  and 
laconically  described  her  desperate  state  in  these 
words : 

"  The  old  excuses  of  bygone  times  are  alleged  for 
my  detention ;  now  a  change  in  Scotland,  now  a  dis- 
turbance in  France,  now  the  discovery  of  a  conspir- 
acy in  this  country,  and,  in  fine,  the  least  innovation 
that  may  occur  in  any  part  of  Christendom ;  so  that 
it  is  likely  I  shall  be  liberated,  as  children  say,  when 
all  the  world  is  at  peace  and  quietness.  May  God  in 
his  omnipotence  be  my  aid  and  protection;  and  may 
he  in  his  justice  judge  my  cause  between  me  and  my 
enemies,  as  I  hope  he  will  do  sooner  or  later."  * 

*  The  sorrowful  lines,  in  her  favorite  language,  composed 
during  this  imprisonment,  will  interest  the  French  reader  : 

"  Que  suis-je.  helas  !  et  de  quoy  sort  ma  vie  ? 
Je  ne  suis  fore  qu'tin  c'»rps  prive  de  cueur 
TJn  ombre  vain,  un  ohjrtt  de  malheur, 
Qui  n'a  plus  Hen  que  de  mourir  enne.

December,  1585,  Mary  was  taken  from  Tutbury 
to  Chartley,  in  Staffordshire.  Though  treated  more 
kindly,  she  was  watched  with  no  less  constancy  and 
care. 

While  Mary  Stuart  thus  languished  in  prison, 
friends  to  her  and  the  ancient  faith  she  professed, 
were  busy  with  fresh  plots  for  her  deliverance.  The 
English  refugees  and  proscribed  priests  in  the  pay  of 
Philip  II.  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  for  invading  the 
kingdom  and  dethroning  Elizabeth.  Past  experience 
stimulated  rather  than  daunted  a  faction,  whose  mis- 
sion was  also  the  spread  of  a  persecuting  and  corrupt 
church. 

John  Savage,  an  English  Catholic,  returning  from 
an  official  service  in  the  Spanish  army,  at  Rheims, 
met  Dr.  William  Gifford,  a  countryman  and  Papist, 
who  suggested,  as  the  highest  deed  of  pious  bravery  in 
his  power,  the  assassination  of  Elizabeth — the  pre- 
lude to  a  maturing  plan  of  invasion.  He  accepted 
the  honor,  and  was  to  shoot  or  stab  the  Queen,  in  the 
gallery  through  which  she  passed  to  and  from  chapel. 

But  before  he  could  attempt  the  execution  of  his 
purpose,  a  priest,  named  Ballard,  arrived  in  London, 
May  22d,  1585,  on  the  same  mission.  Encountering 

Plus  ne  portez,  o  ennemis,  d'auvie 
A  qui  n'a  plus  1'esprit  a  la  grandeur ! 
La  consomme  d'excessive  doulleur  ; 
Votre  ire  en  brief  se  voirra  assouvie ; 
Et  vous  amys,  qui  m'avez  tenu  chere, 
Souvenez-vous  que  sans  heur,  sans  santay, 
Je  ne  sgaurois  auqun  bon  oeuvre  fayre, 
Souhatez  done  fin  de  calamitay  ; 
Et  que  sa  bas  estant  assez  punie 
J'aye  ma  part  .en  la  joye  infinie." 


37»'.  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

Anthony  Babington,  a  gentleman  of  fortune  and  gay 
life,  who  had  been  for  years  devoted  to  Mary  Stuarf, 
Ballard  proposed  to  him  the  plot.  He  entered  into 
it  enthusiastically,  and  associated  with  him  Savage 
and  five  of  his  own  friends.  Walsingham,  the  Eng- 
lish minister,  had  arranged  a  complete  system  of  es- 
pionage, and  scarcely  had  the  conspirators  assembled, 
when  his  agents  were  without  suspicion  admitted  to 
their  councils.  He  also  communicated  to  Mary 
Stuart  through  a  treacherous  Catholic  priest,  the  se- 
cret designs  against  Elizabeth,  to  secure  her  approval, 
and  the  inevitable  doom  which  would  follow ;  and  so 
rid  the  realm  of  the  dreaded  captive. 

During  the  summer,  Gifford,  Walsingham's  spy, 
was  busy,  preparing  the  way  of  access  to  Mary's  par- 
tizans  and  herself.  He  at  length  obtained  the  neces- 
sary confidence  among  the  Papists  of  London,  and 
letters  of  introduction  to  the  prisoner  at  Chartley. 
In  March,  1586,  he  returned  from  an  interview  with 
Mary,  the  accepted  messenger  of  the  fatally  deluded 
victim  of  ambition  and  Catholic  zeal.  The  ignis 
fatuus  of  false  hope  again  dawned  before  her  fading 
eye,  and  her  pantings  after  freedom  impelled  her  on 
to  ruin.  This  was  the  opening  work  in  the  cele- 
brated "  Babington  Conspiracy."  The  presiding 
genius  of  the  daring  machination  thus  expressed  his 
plans,  in  a  letter  which  Gifford  transmitted  to  Wal- 
singham : 

"  Myself  in  person,  with  ten  gentlemen  and  a  hun- 
dred others  of  our  company  and  suite,  will  undertake 
the  deliverance  of  your  royal  person  from  the  hands 
of  your  enemies.  As  regards  getting  rid  of  the  usur- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  377 

per  from  subjection  to  whom  we  are  absolved,  by  the 
act  of  excommunication  issued  against  her,  there  are 
six  gentlemen  of  quality,  all  of  them  my  intimate 
friends,  who,  for  the  love  they  bear  to  the  Catholic 
cause  and  to  your  majesty's  service,  will  undertake 
the  tragic  execution.  It  remains  now,  that,  accord- 
ing to  their  infinite  desert,  and  your  majesty's  good- 
ness, their  heroic  enterprise  should  be  honorably  rec- 
ommended in  themselves,  if  they  escape  with  their 
lives,  or  in  their  posterity,  if  they  fall;  and  that  I 
may  give  them  this  assurance  by  your  majesty's  au- 
thority." 

Poor  Mary  was  in  the  snares  of  the  artful  fowler. 
July  27th,  having  received  the  intercepted  letter,  she 
wrote  to  Babington  as  follows : 

"  Affairs  being  thus  prepared,  then  shall  it  be  time 
to  set  the  six  gentlemen  to  work;  taking  order,  upon 
the  accomplishing  of  their  design,  I  may  suddenly  be 
transported  out  of  the  place,  and  that  all  your  forces, 
in  the  same  time,  be  on  the  field  to  meet  me,  whilst 
we  wait  the  arrival  of  help  from  abroad,  which  must 
then  be  hastened  with  all  diligence.  JSTor  for  that 
there  can  be  no  certain  day  appointed  of  the  accom- 
plishing the  said  gentlemen's  designment — to  the  end 
that  others  may  be  in  readiness  to  take  me  from 
hence,  I  would  that  the  said  gentlemen  had  always 
about  them,  or  at  the  least,  at  court,  four  stout  men 
furnished  with  good  and  speedy  horses,  for,  so  soon 
as  the  said  design  shall  be  executed,  to  come  with  all 
diligence,  to  advertise  thereof  those  that  shall  be  ap- 
pointed for  my  transporting ;  to  the  end  that,  imme- 
diately thereafter,  they  may  be  at  the  place  of  my 


378  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SOOTS. 

siln •&lt;!&lt;•,  tafore  that  my  keeper  can  have  advice  of  the 
•iition  of  the  naid  design;  or  at  l&lt;-;i-t  l»-t'on-  li&lt;-  ran 
fortifv  himself  withiu  the  house,  or  carry  me  out  of 
the  same.  It  were  necessary  to  dispatch  two  or  three 
•  •I  the  said  advertisers  by  divers  ways,  to  the  end  that 
if  one  be  staid,  the  other  may  come  through;  and  at 
the  same  instant,  were  it  also  needful,  to  essay  to  cut 
off  the  post's  ordinary  ways.  If  I  remain  here,  there 
is  for  my  escape  but  one  of  these  three  means  follow- 
ing to  be  looked  to.  The  first,  that  at  one  certain 
day  appointed,  in  my  walking  abroad  on  horseback 
on  the  moors,  betwixt  this  and  Stafford,  where  ordi- 
narily you  know  very  few  people  do  pass,  a  fifty  «&gt;r 
three-score  horsemen,  well  horsed  and  armed,  come 
to  take  me  there ;  as  they  may  easily,  my  keeper  hav- 
ing with  him  ordinarily  but  eighteen  or  twenty  horse- 
men. The  second  mean  is  to  come  at  midnight,  or 
soon  after,  to  set  fire  in  the  barns  and  stables,  which 
you  know  are  near  to  the  house;  and  whilst  that  my 
guardian's  servants  shall  rush  forth  to  the  fire,  your 
company  (having  every  one  a  mark  whereby  they 
may  know  one  another  under  night,)  might  surprise 
the  house,  where  I  hope,  with  the  few  servants  I  have 
about  me,  I  were  able  to  give  you  correspondence. 
And  the  third:  some  that  bring  carts  hither,  ordi- 
narily coming  early  in  the  morning;  their  carts  might 
be  so  prepared,  and  with  such  cart-leaders,  that  being 
cast  in  the  midst  of  the  great  irate,  the  cart  might  fall 
down  or  overwhelm,  arid  that  thereupon  you  miirht 
come  suddenly  with  your  followers  to  make  yourself 
masters  of  the  house,  and  carry  me  away." 

When  Walsingham  had   possessed  himself  of  all 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  379 

the  proofs  required,  and  the  track  of  each  conspira- 
tor, he  informed  Elizabeth  of  the  terrible  intrigues 
around  her  throne.  She  was  alarmed,  and  ordered 
an  immediate  arrest  of  the  guilty  men.  With  mani- 
fold difficulties  and  partial  failures,  the  leaders  were 
secured  in  the  Tower.  Walsingham  now  was  ready 
to  treat  Mary  Stuart  as  their  accomplice.  According 
to  an  unsuspected  arrangement,  she  was  invited  to 
join  a  hunting  party  in  a  neighboring  park;  she 
gladly  accepted.  It  was  on  the  8th  of  August ;  and 
while  riding  away  from  Chartley,  Sir  Thomas  Gorges 
appeared  before  her,  informed  her  of  the  discovered 
conspiracy,  and  of  orders  to  conduct  her  to  Tixall 
Castle,*  whose  grounds  were  the  sporting  field  in 
view.  The  astonished  Queen  was  silent  awhile,  then 
with  great  vehemence  indulged  in  bitter  reproaches, 
and  inquired  of  her  attendants  if  they  would  permit 
the  disgraceful  capture,  without  an  effort  to  defend 
her  person.  She  was  led  to  the  fortress,  confined  in 
a  small  apartment,  and  allowed  to  see  none  but 
strangers.  During  the  absence  of  seventeen  days 
from  Chartley,  her  desks  were  opened  by  Wood  and 
Paulet,  who  transmitted  her  papers,  jewelry  and 
money  to  Elizabeth.  The  Queen  of  England  was  re- 
lieved, and  joyful,  and  extravagantly  thanked  the 
Vandals  for  their  pillage.  August  25th,  when  with 
a  large  escort  of  horsemen  she  reentered  Chartley,  the 
spectacle  of  her  desolate  room  kindled  her  indigna- 
tion, and  she  exclaimed,  "  There  are  two  things  which 
the  Queen  of  England  can  never  take  from  me — the 

*  Tixall,  the  mansion  of  Sir  Walter  Aston,  was  about  three 
miles  from  Chartley,  which  in  turn  is  eleven  miles  northeast 
of  Stafford. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

ltl««&gt;d  royal  which  give-  me  a  right  to  the  succession 
&lt;&gt;f  Kuglami,  and  the  attachment  which  makes  my 
heart  beat  for  the  religion  of  my  fathers." 

Babington,  Ballanl  and  Savage   were  condemned 
.for  treason,  and  to  make  their  fate  the  more  influen- 
tial in  deterring  others  from  similar  crimes,   ii 
were  put  to  the  torture,  and  made  the  targets  of  royal 
vengeance. 

September  20th,  with  their  confederates,  they  were 
taken  to  St.Giles-in-fields,*  where  they  had  held  their 
meetings,  and  there  drawn  and  quartered  in  the  sight 
of  a  horror-smitten  populace.  Elizabeth  accumu- 
lated evidence  of  Mary's  guilt,  and  yet  the  fear  of 
foreign  interference,  and  the  enmity  of  powerful 
friends  of  the  prisoner,  created  hesitation  and  con- 
flicting emotions,  before  she  decided  to  bring  her  to 
trial. 

Mary  no  longer  fanned  the  embers  of  hope;  she 
wept  at  the  threshold  of  her  last  earthly  trial,  whose 
issues  would  deliver  up  to  the  final  audit,  that  ar- 
raigns alike  Kings  and  serfs,  her  eventful  career. 

*  The  church  of  St.  Giles-in-the-Fields  is  situated  in  High- 
street,  a  little  to  the  south  of  New  Oxford-street,  London. 


NINETEEN  years  of  captivity  had  worn  away,  and 
Mary  Stuart's  death,  which  had  been  often  suggested 
and  anxiously  desired,  was  the  theme  of  grave  and 
final  discussion  between  Elizabeth  and  her  privy 
council.  Closer  imprisonment  was  urged  in  opposi- 
tion to  capital  punishment.  But  the  consideration  of 
the  safety  of  the  Queen  of  England,  and  the  triumph 
of  Protestantism,  decided  the  vote  for  a  public  trial, 
and  judicial  sentence.  The  statute  under  which  the 
prisoner  was  arraigned,  was  the  law  passed  after  the 
act  of  association  expired,  the  year  before,  conferring 
the  power  to  prosecute  and  execute  any  person  who 
should  assert  a  right  to  the  English  throne,  or  engage 
in  plots  to  wrest  the  crown  from  the  brow  of  Eliza- 
beth. This  was  more  plausible  than  the  statute  of 
Edward  III.,  on  high  treason. 

Mary  was  indicted  October  5th,  1586,  before  a 
court  of  state  officers,  peers,  and  counselors  of  the  sov- 
ereign. The  whole  number  of  eminent  names  in  the 
tribunal  was  forty-six.  Fortheringay  Castle,  in 
Northamptonshire,  was  selected  as  the  place  of  trial. 
Mary  Stuart  was  escorted  to  the  fortress  the  next  day, 
where  she  received  a  letter  from  Elizabeth,  repeating 
her  cutting  accusations,  and  urging  her  to  submit  to 
the  course  of  justice.  Turning  to  Paulet  and  Mild- 
may,  her  keeper  and  privy  counselor,  she  said,  with 
great  emotion  and  resentment : 

381 


ITEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"  What!  doe«  your  inistn&gt;s  not  know  that  I  am  a 
Queen  born  ?  !&gt;«&gt;&lt;•&gt;  &gt;he  think  that  I  will  degrade  my 
rank,  my  condition,  the  race  from  which  I  spring,  the 
son  who  is  to  succeed  me,  the  foreign  kings  ami 
princes  whose  rights  would  IK'  injured  in  my  person, 
by  obeying  such  a  letter  as  that! — Never!  Hum- 
bled as  I  may  seem,  my  heart  is  too  great  to  submit 
to  any  humiliation!  " 

She  added,  further,  that  she  was  deprived  of  her 
papers,  destitute  of  advisers,  and  surrounded  by  ene- 
mies; that  she  was  ignorant  of  the  laws  and  the  stat- 
utes of  the  kingdom,  where  she  must  look  in  vain  for 
peers  competent  to  try  her:  and  finally  declared  that 
she  was  innocent.  "  I  have  neither,"  she  said,  "  di- 
rected nor  encouraged  any  attempt  against  your  mis- 
tress. I  am  certain  that  nothing  of  the  kind  can  be 
proved  against  me,  although  I  frankly  confess  that, 
when  my  sister  had  rejected  all  my  offers,  I  com- 
mitted myself  and  my  cause  to  the  care  of  foreign 
princes." 

Mary's  refusal  to  be  treated  as  a  criminal,  and  as- 
serting her  queenly  dignity,  did  not  foil  her  captor, 
who  ordered  the  commissioners  to  commence  the 
investigation  ;  while,  to  obtain  consent  to  the  legal  or- 
deal, she  wrote  the  desolate,  yet  proud  descendant  of 
Bruce,  in  this  strain: 

"  You  have  tried  in  various  ways  to  take  my  life, 
and  to  ruin  my  kingdom  by  bloodshed.  I  have  never 
neted  so  harshly  towards  yon,  but,  on  the  contrary, 
have  preserved  you  as  if  you  were  my  second  self. 
Your  treasonable  acts  will  bo  proved  and  made  man- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  383 

ifest.  For  this  reason,  our  pleasure  is  that  you  reply 
to  the  nobles  and  peers  of  my  kingdom,  as  you  would 
do  if  I  myself  were  present.  I  require  and  command 
you  to  do  this.  I  have  been  informed  of  your  arro- 
gance :  act  with  candor,  and  you  shall  be  treated  with 
greater  favor." 

Lord  Burghley  advised  Mary  to  yield  to  what  was 
inevitable;  and  after  a  night  of  mental  anguish — • 
the  fierce  struggle  of  wounded  pride  with  resistless 
power — she  gave  her  consent  to  answer  her  judges 
upon  the  charges  presented. 

October  14th,  followed  by  a  detachment  of  halber- 
diers, and  supported  by  her  maitre  d'hotel,  Sir  An- 
drew Melville,  and  her  physician,  Bourgoin,  for  she 
walked  with  great  difficulty,  she  descended  into  the 
great  hall  of  Fotheringay,  where  the  commissioners 
were  seated  in  the  form  of  a  court  of  justice.  At 
one  end  of  the  hall,  under  a  dais,  surmounted  by  the 
arms  of  England  alone,  stood,  in  an  elevated  position, 
an  arm-chair,  reserved  for  the  absent  Queen  Eliza- 
beth, and  which  remained  unoccupied.  On  each  side 
of  the  dais  were  ranged,  in  the  order  of  their  respec- 
tive dignities,  the  different  commissioners:  on  the 
right,  the  Lord  Chancellor  Bromley,  the  Lord  High 
Treasurer  Burghley,  the  Earls  of  Oxford,  Kent,  Der- 
by, Worcester,  Rutland,  Cumberland,  Warwick, 
Pembroke,  Lincoln,  and  Viscount  Montagu;  on  the 
left,  Lords  Abergavenny,  Zouch,  Morley,  Stafford, 
Grey,  Lumley,  and  other  peers,  next  to  whom  were 
the  Lords  of  the  Privy  Council,  Crofts,  Hatton,  Wal- 
singham,  Sadler,  Mildmay,  and  Paulet.  More  in  the 
front  were  placed,  on  the  right,  the  Chief  Justices  of 


384  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

jhiinl  and  Chief  Baron  of  the  Exchequer,  and  on 
the  left,  the  other  judges  and  barons,  along  with  two 
doctors  of  civil  law.  In  the  centre  were  seated, 
around  a  table,  the  Queen's  Attorney  General,  Pop- 
.hara;  her  Solicitor,  Kgerton;  her  Law  Sergeant, 
Gawdy;  and  Thomas  Powell,  Clerk  of  the  Crown, 
together  with  two  clerks  of  the  court,  to  write  out  the 
proceedings.  A  few  gentlemen  of  the  neighborhood 
who  were  allowed  to  be  present,  stood  at  the  bar.* 

The  helpless  Queen  was  undaunted  by  the  brilliant 
and  solemn  array  of  England's  statesmen  and  jurists, 
and  offered  her  salutations  with  the  mournful  air  of 
fallen  greatness,  and  the  gracefulness  of  perfect  re- 
finement. When  led  to  the  velvet  chair  designed  for 
her,  and  set  without  the  royal  canopy,  she  was 
touched  with  the  insult  to  her  dignity,  and  said  with 
imperial  tone,  "  I  am  a  Queen ;  I  was  married  to  a 
King  of  France,  and  my  place  should  be  there." 
Then  glancing  along  the  aisle  of  nobles  and  counsel- 
ors, she  added,  "  Alas !  there  are  a  great  number  of 
counselors  here,  and  yet  not  one  of  them  is  for  me." 

Bromley,  the  Chancellor,  rose  as  Mary  Stuart  took 
her  seat,  and  opened  the  imposing  trial,  by  declaring 
the  imperative  duty  the  cause  of  God  and  invaded 
authority  imposed  upon  Elizabeth,  to  arraign  and  try 
the  prisoner.  The  clerk  of  the  crown  followed  with 
the  reading  of  the  commission  of  the  court.  Mary, 
in  reply,  claimed  her  rights  as  a  princess,  and  accused 
her  rival  of  unkindly  abusing  her  confidence,  in  re- 
jecting all  overtures,  and  detaining  her  a  captive. 

The  intercepted  letters,  and  the  confessions  of  the

MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  385 

conspirators,  were  then  read.  Mary  immediately, 
and  without  the  slightest  embarrassment,  assailed  the 
testimony,  denying  its  validity,  because  the  docu- 
ments were  copies  of  unproduced  originals,  and  the 
depositions  were  those  of  men  whom  she  had  never 
seen.  She  summed  up  her  defence  in  these  words, 
sighing  deeply  while  she  proceeded: 

"  I  do  not  deny  having  wished  for  liberty,  and  hav- 
ing earnestly  tried  to  regain  it.  Nature  urged  me  to 
this;  but  I  take  God  to  witness,  that  I  have  never 
conspired  against  the  life  of  the  Queen  of  England, 
and  that  I  never  approved  of  such  a  conspiracy.  I 
confess  that  I  wrote  to  my  friends,  soliciting  their 
aid  in  delivering  me  from  the  wretched  prisons, 
where  I  have  been  held  captive  for  nineteen  years. 
I  confess,  too,  that  I  have  often  written  in  favor  of 
the  persecuted  Catholics,  and  that  if  I  could  have  de- 
livered them  from  oppression  by  the  shedding  of  my 
own  blood,  I  would  have  done  it.  But  the  letters 
produced  against  me  were  not  written  by  me,  and  I 
cannot  be  answerable  for  the  dangerous  designs  of 
desperate  persons,  who  are  unknown  to  me." 

The  Lord  Treasurer  answered  with  a  close  analysis 
of  the  Babington  letter,  and  the  corroborative  evi- 
dence. Mary  adroitly  adhered  to  her  position,  and 
glanced  at  the  character  of  such  witnesses  as  she 
knew,  with  much  discrimination  and  sarcasm ;  and 
thus  closed  her.  spirited  and  well  delivered  argument : 

"  And  am  I,  a  Queen,  to  be  judged  guilty  on  such 
proofs  as  these  ?  Is  it  not  manifest,  that  there  must 
be  an  end  to  the  majesty  and  security  of  princes,  if 
they  are  made  to  depend  on  the  writings  and  the  tes- 
timony of  their  secretaries  ?  I  claim  the  privilege  of 

25 


;&gt;,;  M  \KY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

l&gt;e ing  judged  from  my  own  words  ami  my  own  writ- 
ings, and  I  am  certain  that  none  will  IK-  found  against 
me." 

Upon  the  second  hcarin*:  before  tin-  commissioners, 
Mary  did  not  repudiate  nil  of  her  alleged  correspon- 
dence, hut  still  protested  her  innocence.  She  said, 
"  I  have  been  anxious  that  the  safety  of  the  Catholics 
&gt;hould  IK?  provided  for,  hut  I  never  wished  that  it 
should  be  obtained  by  means  of  bloodshed  and  mur- 
der. I  have  preferred  the  part  of  Esther  to  that  of 
Judith,  seeking  rather  to  intercede  with  God  for  the 
people,  than  to  deprive  even  the  meanest  of  them  of 
life." 

The  invasion  of  England  and  Elizabeth's  death,  it 
was  maintained,  were  connected  inseparably.  The 
prisoner  insisted  that  she  was  guiltless  of  any  design 
against  the  life  of  the  Queen  of  England:  with  the 
eloquence  of  finished  oratory  and  tears,  she  went  on 
to  say : 

"With  what  justice  am  I  treated !  My  letters  have 
been  picked  out  and  perverted  from  their  original 
meaning,  and  the  originals  have  been  taken  from  me. 
Xo  consideration  is  shown  for  the  religion  which  I 
profess,  and  the  sacred  character  I  bear  as  Queen. 
If  my  sentiments,  my  lords,  are  personally  indiffer- 
ent to  you,  you  might  at  least  consider  the  majesty 
of  royalty,  which  is  injured  in  my  person,  and  think 
of  the  example  you  are  setting.  I  entered  this  coun- 
try confiding  in  the  friendship  and  the  promises  of 
the  Queen  of  England,"  and  then,  taking  a  ring  from 
her  finder,  and  holding  it  up  to  her  judges,  "  Here, 
my  lords,  here  is  the  pledge  of  love  and  protection 
which  I  received  from  your  royal  mistn-s.  Look 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  387 

well  at  it.  It  was  in  reliance  upon  this  that  I  came 
among  you.  Nobody  knows  better  than  yourselves 
how  this  pledge  has  been  respected."  She  then  de- 
manded to  be  heard  before  Parliament,  or  to  have  an 
interview  with  Elizabeth,  and  added,  "  As  one  who  is 
accused  of  crimes,  I  claim  the  privilege  of  an  advo- 
cate to  plead  my  cause;  or  else,  as  a  Queen,  I  call 
upon  you  to  believe  the  word  of  a  Queen." 

After  this  appeal,  October  15th,  1586,  the  commis- 
sioners unanimously  gave  the  sentence  of  condemna- 
tion against  the  unhappy  and  defenceless  Mary.  The 
last  act  of  her  stern  jurors  and  judges,  which  sealed 
her  fate,  charged  her  with  the  knowledge  of  the  Bab- 
ington  plot,  to  destroy  Elizabeth,  and  invade  Eng- 
land with  a  Papal  army.  The  legitimacy  and  honor 
of  James  VI.  were  carefully  guarded  in  the  ruin  of 
the  mother.  Parliament  assembled,  and  approved 
the  decision ;  with  expressions  of  thanksgiving  to  God 
for  the  discovery  of  the  dangerous  schemes  of  their 
sovereign's  enemies,  the  members  of  both  houses  de- 
manded of  the  Queen  the  execution  of  the  sentence  of 
the  high  court  of  the  realm.  In  reply,  she  rendered 
praise  to  the  Divine  Goodness  for  miraculous  deliver- 
ance from  so  many  perils,  and  closed  a  message  of 
regret  that  she  was  compelled  to  deal  severely  with 
"  the  unfortunate  lady,"  in  the  following  language : 

"  Do  not  hurry  my  decision.  It  is  an  affair  of 
great  importance,  and  I  am  accustomed  to  deliberate 
longer  on  less  weighty  matters  before  making  up  my 
mind.  I  shall  pray  Almighty  God  to  enlighten  my 
understanding,  and  to  show  me  what  will  be  best  for 
the  interests  of  his  church,  the  prosperity  of  my  peo- 
ple, and  your  own  security."

I  li/.;ilx'ili*&gt;  mind  \\;i&gt;  distressed  with  the  respon- 
sihility  which  she  could  not  cscajH'.  How  far  her  ap- 
parent agitation  was  designed  for  effect,  is  ;i  matter 
of  conjecture,  founded  H|M&gt;II  the  p-ncral  estimate  of 
her  character.  Hut  there  was  occasion  to  feel,  as  she 
said,  more  jH-rph-xcd  than  ever  before' — that  she 
could  have  wi.-Iied  to  preserve  her  own  life  without 
&gt;acrih'cing  that  of  another — and  that  it  ap|M-ared 
cruel  to  dip  the  hands  of  the  executioner  in  the  hlood 
of  so  near  a  relative.  Tn  putting  off  with  further  de- 
lay the  importunate  Parliament,  she  closed  the  inter- 
view with  the  chancellor  and  s|H&gt;aker.  saving:  "  If 
I  accede  to  your  request,  I  should  say,  jx-rhaps,  more 
than  I  think;  and,  if  I  reject  it,  I  precipitate  myself 
into  the  very  danger  from  which  you  would  save  me. 
Accept,  I  pray  you,  my  thanks  and  my  jx'rplexities, 
and  take  in  good  part  an  answer  which  is  no  answer." 
Meanwhile,  November  10th,  Lord  1  la i hurst  and 
Robert  Bcale,  clerk  of  the  council,  were  dispatched 
to  Fotheringay  Castle,  and  announced  to  Mary  the 
result  of  the  trial,  and  the  vote  of  Parliament,  and 
urged  an  immediate  preparation  for  execution.  The 
terriltle  tidings  were  listened  to  by  the  royal  captive 
with  no  visible  signs  of  alarm  or  grief.  She  thanked 
God  for  being  deemed  worthy  to  IK-  instrumental  in 
advancing  the  Catholic  faith,  and  to  suffer  in  the  holy 
cause.  The  messengers  of  doom  assured  her,  that 
she  could  neither  IK-  regarded  a~  a  saint  or  a  martyr, 
having  been  involved  in  the  fearful  intrigues,  whose 
aim  was  an  armed  invasion  of  the  kingdom,  and  the 
overthrow  of  its  sovereign.  She  was  treated  thence- 
forth with  marked  indignity.  Tier  request  for  a  spir- 
itual adviser  was  rejected;  and  Paulet  ordered  a  can-

opy  bearing  her  arms  to  be  removed.  The  friendless 
Queen  wrote  the  Pope,  asking  his  blessing,  commit- 
ting her  son  to  his  fatherly  care,  and  resigned  herself 
to  the  prospect  of  hastening  death.  The  following 
letters  were  written  at  this  time.  They  disclose  her 
frame  of  feeling,  and  her  ardent  devotion  to  the 
church  of  Rome. 

THE  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS  TO  DON  BERNARD  DE  MENDOCA.* 

"  My  very  dear  friend — Having  ever  found  you 
zealous,  in  the  cause  of  God,  and  desirous  of  my  wel- 
fare and  deliverance  from  captivity,  I  have  always 
communicated  to  you  all  my  intentions  upon  that  sub- 
ject, begging  you  to  make  them  known  to  the  King, 
my  good  brother.  For  this  same  reason  I  now  write 
to  bid  you  a  last  adieu,  notwithstanding  the  little 
leisure  I  have,  being  about  to  receive  the  stroke  of 
death,  which  was  announced  to  me  on  Saturday  last ; 
I  do  not  know  when,  or  in  what  manner ;  but  at  least 
you  may  praise  God  for  me  that,  through  his  grace,  I 
have  had  the  heart  to  receive  this  unjust  sentence  of 
heretics  with  resignation,  on  account  of  the  happiness 
which  I  esteem  it  to  shed  my  blood  at  the  requisi- 
tion of  the  enemies  of  His  church,  who  do  me  the 
honor  to  say  that  it  cannot  be  subverted  while  I  am 
alive,  and  also  that  their  Queen  cannot  reign  in  safety 
in  the  same  predicament. 

"  As  for  these  two  conditions,  I  have  accepted  with- 
out contradiction  the  high  honor  which  they  confer 
upon  me,  as  one  most  zealous  for  the  Catholic  religion

for  which  I  have  publicly  offered  my  life;  ami,  a-  for 
the  other,  although  I  have  never  committed  cither  act 
«T  deed  tending  to  take  off  her  \vh«»  was  mi  the  thr 
unless  it  be  that  they  make  a  crime  «if  my  right  to 
the  crown,  which  is  acknowledged  l»y  all  Catholics, 
I  would  not  contradict  them,  leaving  them  to 
think  as  they  please.  This  annoyed  them  much,  and 
they  told  me  that,  whatever  I  might  say  or  do,  it 
will  not  be  for  the  cause  of  religion  that  I  shall  die, 
but  for  having  endeavored  to  murder  their  Queen. 
This  I  denied,  as  being  utterly  false,  having  never  at- 
tempted any  such  thing,  and  leaving  it  to  God  and 
the  church  to  dispose  of  this  island  in  what  relates 
to  religion. 

"  The  bearer  of  this  has  promised  to  relate  to  you 
rfow  rigorously  I  have  been  treated  by  those  here,  and 
how  ill  served  by  others  whom  I  did  not  expect  to 
have  shown  so  great  a  fear  of  death  in  so  just  a  quar- 
rel. They  have  not  been  able  to  draw  anything  from 
me  but  that  I  am  a  Queen,  free,  Catholic,  and  obe- 
dient to  the  church;  and  that,  not  being  able  to  ef- 
fect my  deliverance  by  fair  means,  I  was  compelled 
to  seek  it  by  those  which  presented  themselves.  Xau 
has  confessed  all;  Curie  has  in  a  great  measure  fol- 
lowed his  example;  so  that  everything  turns  against 
me.  I  am  threatened,  if  I  do  not  beg  pardon ;  but  I 
say  that,  as  they  had  already  destined  me  to  die,  they 
might  proceed  with  their  injustice,  hoping  that  God 
will  recompense  me  in  another  world ;  and,  out  of 
spite,  because  I  will  not  speak,  they  came  yesterday, 
Monday,  and  took  down  my  canopy,*  saying  that  I 
was  no  more  than  a  dead  woman,  and  without  any

rank.  They  are  at  present  working  in  my  hall — 
erecting  the  scaffold,  I  suppose,  whereon  I  am  to  per- 
form the  last  act  of  this  tragedy.  I  die  in  a  just 
cause,  and  am  happy  in  having  made  over  my  rights 
to  the  King,  your  master.  I  have  said  that  I  con- 
sider him,  should  my  son  not  return  to  the  bosom  of 
the  church,  as  being  a  prince  the  most  worthy  to  gov- 
ern and  direct  this  island.  I  have  written  to  the 
same  purposes  to  his  Holiness,  and  I  beg  you  to  as- 
sure him  that  I  die  in  the  determination  which  I  have 
communicated  to  you,  and  also  another,  whom  you 
know  to  be  his  dearest  and  most  intimate  friend,  and 
a  fourth,  and  these  above  all  others  I  bequeath  to  the 
protection  of  the  King,  beseeching  him  in  God's  name 
not  to  abandon  them,  and  entreating  them  to  serve 
him  in  place  of  me.  As  I  cannot  write  to  them,  greet 
them  in  my  name,  and  pray  to  God,  all  of  you,  for 
my  soul.  I  have  asked  for  a  priest;  but  I  do  not 
know  if  my  request  will  be  granted.  They  have  of- 
fered me  one  of  their  bishops;  but  I  positively  re- 
fused him.  You  may  believe  all  that  the  bearer  of 
this  shall  tell  you,  and  also  those  two  poor  girls  who 
have  been  immediately  about  my  person;  they  will 
tell  you  the  truth,  which  I  beg  you  to  make  public,  as 
I  fear  that  a  very  different  interpretation  will  be 
given.  Order  a  mass  to  be  said  for  the  deliverance 
and  repose  of  my  soul ;  you  know  the  place  I  mean — 
and  let  the  churches  in  Spain  remember  me  in  their 
prayers.  Keep  the  name  of  the  bearer  of  this  secret ; 
he  has  been  a  faithful  servant  to  me.  God  grant  you 
a  long  and  happy  life !  You  will  receive  from  me 
as  a  token  of  my  remembrance,  a  diamond,  which  I 
have  held  very  dear,  having  been  given  to  me  by  the

cannot  read  my  hand,  the  bearer  will  read  it  for  you, 
or  my  ambassador,  whom  he  knows.

that  Nau  and  Pasquier  have  hastened  my  death, 
having  kept  some  papers,  and  they  are  men  who  will

THE  QUEBN   OF  SCOTS  TO  THE  DUKE  OF  GUISE. 

"  My  good  cousin* — You  whom  I  hold  most  dear  in 
the  world,  I  bid  you  farewell,  being  on  the  point  of 
being  put  to  death,  by  an  unjust  judgment,  such  a 
one  as  never  any  belonging  to  our  race  yet  suffered, 
much  less  one  of  my  rank.  But  praise  God,  my  good 
cousin ;  for,  situated  as  I  have  been,  I  was  useless  to 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  393 

the  world  in  the  cause  of  God  and  his  church ;  but  I 
hope  that  my  death  will  bear  witness  of  my  constancy 
in  the  faith,  and  my  readiness  to  die  for  the  support 
and  restoration  of  the  Catholic  church  in  this  unfor- 
tunate island.  And  though  executioner  never  yet 
dipped  his  hand  in  our  blood,  be  not  ashamed,  my 
friend;  for  the  judgment  of  these  heretics  and  ene- 
mies of  the  church,  and  who  have  no  jurisdiction  over 
me,  a  free  Queen,  is  profitable  before  God  and  the 
children  of  his  church,  which,  had  I  not  adhered  to, 
this  stroke  had  been  spared  me.  All  those  of  our 
house  have  been  persecuted  by  this  sect;  witness, 
your  good  father,  with  whom  I  hope  to  be  received  in 
mercy  by  the  just  Judge. 

"  I  recommend,  then,  to  you,  all  my  poor  servants, 
the  discharge  of  my  debts,  and  the  founding  of  some 
annual  obit  for  my  soul ;  not  at  your  expense,  but  to 
make  such  solicitation  and  arrangements  as  shall  be 
requisite  to  fulfill  my  intentions,  which  you  will  be 
informed  of  by  my  poor,  disconsolate  servants,  eye- 
witnesses of  this,  my  last  tragedy. 

"  May  God  prosper  your  wife,  children,  brothers 
and  cousins,  and  especially  our  head,  my  good 
brother  and  cousin,  and  all  belonging  to  him !  May 
the  blessing  of  God,  and  that  which  I  should  give  to 
my  own  children,  be  upon  yours,  whom  I  commend  to 
God,  not  less  sincerely  than  my  own  unfortunate  and 
deluded  son !  You  will  receive  tokens  (rings)  from 
me  to  remind  you  to  have  prayers  said  for  the  soul  of 
your  poor  cousin,  destitute  of  all  aid  and  counsel  but 
that  of  God,  who  gives  me  strength  and  courage  to 
withstand  alone  so  many  wolves  howling  after  me ;  to 
God  be  the  glory!  Believe,  in  particular,  a  person

MI  IT  you,  upon  my  conscience,  that  iliis  person  will 
fell  you  the  truth  agreeably  to  my  desire,  especially 
as  to  what  concerns  my  poor  servants,  and  the  share 
of  each.  I  recommend  to  you  this  person  for  her  sin- 
cerity and  honesty,  in  order  that  she  may  be  put  into 
some  good  place.  I  have  chosen  her  as  being  tin- 
most  impartial,  and  as  one  who  will  most  simply  re- 
jx&gt;rt  my  commands.  I  beg  you  not  to  let  it  be  known 
that  she  has  said  anything  to  you  in  private,  for  envy 
might  injure  her. 

"  I  have  suffered  much  for  the  last  two  years  and 
upward,  but  have  not  been  able  to  inform  you  of  it 
for  an  important  reason.  God  be  praised  for  all 
things,  and  may  he  give  you  grace  to  persevere  in  the 
service  of  his  church,  so  long  as  you  live,  and  may 
that  honor  never  depart  from  our  race,  that  all  of  us, 
both  males  and  females,  may  be  ready  to  shed  our 
blood  in  the  defence  of  the  faith,  regardless  of  all 
other  worldly  interests!  For  my  own  part,  I  think 
myself  born,  l&gt;oth  on  the  father's  and  the  mother's 
side,  to  offer  up  my  blood  for  it,  and  have  no  inten- 
tion to  degenerate.  May  JCMIS,  erueified  for  us,  and 
all  the  holy  martyrs,  render  us,  by  their  intercession,

glory.  From  Fotheringay,  Thursday,  this  24th  Nov.

write  to  the  Queen,  saying  that  this  act  had  not  been 
done  by  her  command,  but  by  the  advice  of  some  of 
her  council.  T  showed  them,  on  the  said  canopy,  in

A  sonnet  written  with  the  violent  close  of  existence 
in  view,  is  melancholy  evidence  of  poetical  genius, 
which,  through  years  of  suffering,  had  seldom 
breathed  in  verse  the  captive's  moan. 

"  Alas  !  what  am  I  ?  and  in  what  estate  ? 

A  wretched  corse,  bereaved  of  its  heart ; 

An  empty  shadow  lost,  unfortunate  ; 

To  die  is  now  in  life  my  on\y  part. 

Foes  to  my  greatness,  let  your  envy  rest ; 

In  me  no  taste  for  grandeur  now  is  found, 

Consumed  by  grief,  with  heavy  ills  opprest, 

Your  wishes  and  desires  will  soon  be  crowned. 

And  you,  my  friends,  who  still  have  held  me  dear, 

Bethink  you,  that  when  health  and  heart  are  fled, 

And  every  hope  of  future  good  is  dead, 

'Tis  time  to  wish  our  sorrows  ended  here, 

And  that  this  punishment  on  earth  is  given, 

That  I  may  live  to  endless  bliss  in  heaven."  *

"  Que  suis-je,  helas  ?  et  de  quoy  sert  la  vie? 
Je'n  suis  fors  qu'un  corps  prive  de  cceur, 
Un  ombre  vain,  un  object  de  malheur, 
Qui  n'a  plus  rien  que  de  mourir  en  vie. 
Plus  ne  me  portez— O  ennemis,  d'envie : 
Qui  n'a  plus  1'esprit  a  la  grandeur, 
Votre  ire  en  bref  devoir  assouvir.

MARY  QUKEN  OF  SCOTS. 

She  a  l-o  -« nt  her  hi&lt;t  message  to  Elizabeth,  in  af- 
•  ni£  lan^uaue,  breathing  tin-  eni-lird  ;inil&gt;iti&lt;&gt;ii  »i  a 
long  life — regard  for  u  form  which  had  been  the  ad- 
miration of  the  worhl — and  solicitude  for  those,  how- 
ever humble,  who  were  faithful  unto  death : 

"  Madam,  I  return  thanks  to  God  with  all  my 
heart,  that  it  pleases  him  to  put  an  end,  through  your 
decree,  to  the  weary  pilgrimage  of  my  life.  I  do  not 
ask  that  it  may  be  prolonged,  having  had  but  too  long 
experience  of  its  bitterness.  I  only  beseech  your 
majesty  that,  as  I  cannot  look  for  any  kindness  from 
certain  zealous  ministers  who  hold  the  highest  rank 
in  the  government  of  England,  I  may  receive  from 
you  alone,  and  not  from  others,  the  following  favors: 

"  In  the  first  place,  I  ask  that,  as  it  is  not  allowable 
for  me  to  expect  a  burial  in  England,  according  to  the 
Catholic  solemnities  practised  by  the  ancient  kings, 
your  ancestors  and  mine,  and  as  in  Scotland  dishonor 
and  violence  has  been  done  to  the  ashes  of  my  progen- 
itors— as  soon  as  my  enemies  shall  be  satiated  with 
my  innocent  blood,  my  body  may  be  carried  by  my 
servants  into  some  godly  land,  especially  France, 
where  the  bones  of  the  Queen,  my  honored  mother, 
repose,  in  order  that  this  poor  body,  which  has 
never  known  rejx»se  since  it  has  been  united  to  my 
soul,  may  at  length  find  peace  when  separated  from  it. 

"Secondly,  I  pray  your  majesty,  from  the  appre- 
hension I  feel  for  the  tyranny  of  those  to  whose 
power  you  have  abandoned  me,  that  I  may  not  be  exe- 
cuted in  any  secret  place,  but  in  the  sight  of  my 

Je  ne  s^aurois  aucun  bon  oeuvre  faire  ; 
Souhaitez  done  fin  de  calamite." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  397 

domestics  and  other  persons  who  may  be  ^ble  to  bear, 
witness  to  my  faith  and  obedience  in  the  true  church, 
and  to  defend  the  remainder  of  my  life  and  my  last 
breath  from  the  false  reports  which  my  enemies  may 
spread. 

"  Thirdly,  I  request  that  my  domestics,  who  have 
served  me  through  so  many  troubles,  and  with  so 
much  fidelity,  may  be  allowed  to  retire  freely  wher- 
ever they  may  wish  to  go,  and  to  enjoy  the  small 
presents  which  my  poverty  has  bequeathed  them  in 
my  will. 

"  I  conjure  you,  madam,  by  the  blood  of  Jesus 
Christ,  by  our  relationship,  by  the  memory  of  Henry 
VII.,  our  common  parent,  and  by  the  title  of 
Queen,  which  I  still  bear  till  death,  not  to  refuse 
these  my  reasonable  requests,  and  to  give  me  assur- 
ance of  that  by  a  line  under  your  hand ;  and  there- 
upon I  will  die,  as  I  have  lived,  your  affectionate 
sister  and  prisoner."

or  not,  is  unknown. 

The  condemnation  of  Mary  had  aroused  adjacent 
kingdoms,  and  startled  the  civilized  world.  Ambas- 
sadors from  Scotland  and  France  arrived  at  the  court 
'of  England,  to  intercede  with  expostulations  and 
threats  in  behalf  of  the  desolate  princess.  Elizabeth 
answered  that  mercy  to  Mary  Stuart  would  be  cru- 
elty to  herself ;  and  to  make  a  demonstration  of  popu- 
lar feeling  in  the  face  of  foreign  remonstrance,  she 
directed  the  sentence  of  the  court  to  be  proclaimed  in 
the  streets  of  London.  The  Lord  Mayor,  Earl  of 
Pembroke,  and  the  aldermen,  attended  the  ceremony. 


;;i»s  MAUY  QU1  I  OT8. 

The  last  tones  «&gt;f  the  herald'.-  \..i.-r  were  lost  in  ac- 
clamations and  ringing  of  Ix-lls,  while  bonfires  illu- 
mined at  night  the  rocking  towers  of  every  belfry 
in  the  capital.  For  twenty-four  hours  these  rejoic- 
inirs  continued.  The  ambassadors  of  Henry  III.,  of 
France,  anticipating  the  immediate  execution  of 
Mary,  interfused  a  petition  for  a  postponement  of  the 
fatal  blow. 

In  the  meantime.  M.  de  Bellicvere,  one  of  the  en- 
voys, embarked  for  France,  and  Elizabeth  sent  to 
confront  him,  a  special  messenger,  instructed  to  re- 
sent the  King's  bold  interference,  and  explain  her 
own  acts. 

James  VI.  manifested  no  very  intense  interest  in 
his  mother's  deliverance.  Ruled  by  her  political  pol- 
icy of  grasping  power,  at  all  hazards,  he  preferred 
the  alliance  with  Klixalx'th  to  Mary's  life.  He  con- 
gratulated the  Queon  of  England  ujMin  the  detection 
of  the  late  conspiracy;  and  said  respecting  the  pris- 
oner, that  she  had  broken  her  promises  to  Elizabeth, 
and  must  drink  the  draught  she  had  "  brewed  for 
herself."  But  when  it  was  known  that  the  sentence 
of  death  was  in^x-nding,  the  King,  who  had  not  an- 
ticipated this  result,  sent  William  Keith  with  a  filial, 
menacing  message  t«&gt;  the  court  of  England.  Upon 
receiving  a  haughty  reply  from  Elizabeth,  James 
cowered  and  simply  pressed  the  demand  that  his 
mother  be  no  more  than  securely  confined.  The 
choice  of  peace  with  allies  instead  of  yielding  to  the 
impulses  of  strongest  natural  affection,  awakened  the 
indignation  of  his  subjects,  and  murmurs  of  disap- 
proval were  heard  whenever  he  crossed  the  threshold 
of  his  palace.  Elizabeth  continued  undecided.  Ru- 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  399 

mors  of  new  conspiracies  were  abroad ;  a  prisoner  in 
Newgate  had  proposed  to  D'Estroppes,  member  of  the 
French  embassy,  if  he  would  pay  him  one  hundred 
and  twenty  crowns,  which  would  release  the  debt 
that  incarcerated  him,  to  assassinate  the  Queen.  The 
offer  was  promptly  spurned,  but  accusations  which 
were  made  by  a  disappointed  conspirator,  Stafford, 
involved  the  ambassadors  of  Henry  in  serious  trouble. 
Elizabeth  became  sad  and  gloomy ;  amusements  were 
abandoned,  and  she  was  overheard  repeating  to  her- 
self the  Latin  quotation:  "  Aut  fer  aut;  ne  feriare 
firi."  "  Strike  or  be  struck ;  if  you  would  not  be 
struck,  strike." 

The  crisis  had  come  when  Elizabeth  must  take  the 
responsibility  of  final  action  on  Mary's  fate.  Febru- 
ary 1st,  1587,  Secretary  Davison,  who  was  summoned 
to  her  presence,  appeared  before  her  with  the  war- 
rant of  execution,  drawn  by  High  Treasurer  Hum- 
phrey. She  read  it  carefully,  asked  for  a  pen,  and 
signed  the  instrument  of  death.  She  forbade  a  pub- 
lic execution,  and  ordered  that  it  should  take  place 
in  the  great  hall  of  the  castle,  instead  of  the  open 
court;  intimating  strongly  that  Paulet,  the  keeper, 
and  his  companions,  might  have  relieved  her  of  the 
burden  of  deciding  the  matter,  had  they  been  anxious 
to  serve  her.  The  same  day,  Davison  and  Walsing- 
ham  wrote  to  Paulet  the  following : 

"  After  our  cordial  greetings,  we  perceive,  from 
some  words  lately  spoken  by  her  majesty,  that  she 
remarks  in  you  a  want  of  diligence  and  of  zeal  in 
not  having  discovered  of  yourselves  (without  other 
instigation)  some  mode  of  putting  that  Queen  to 
death,  considering  the  great  danger  to  which  her 


40(1  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

majesty  is  exposed,  as  long  as  the  said  Queen  is  in 
litf.  Not  to  speak  of  the  want  of  affection  towards 
IUT,  her  majesty  remarks  further,  that  you  do  not 
consider  your  own  safety,  or  rather  the  preservation 
of  religion,  ..f  tin-  public  weal,  and  of  the  prosperity 
of  your  country,  as  reason  an&lt;l  policy  require  you  to 
do.  Your  conscience  would  !&gt;«•  peaceful  before  God, 
and  your  reputation  clear  U-fore  the  world,  since  you 
have  taken  the  solemn  oath  of  the  Association,  and 
since,  moreover,  the  facts  charged  airain-t  that  Queen 
have  been  clearly  proved.  Her  majesty,  therefore, 
feels  great  displeasure  at  men  who  profess  attach- 
ment to  her,  as  you  do,  thus  failing  in  their  duty,  and 
seeking  to  throw  on  her  the  weight  of  this  affair,  well 
knowing,  as  you  do,  her  repugnance  to  the  shedding 
of  blood,  particularly  that  of  a  person  of  her  sex  and 
her  rank,  and  so  near  a  relative. 

"  \\V  perceive  that  these  considerations  trouble  her 
majesty  greatly,  who,  we  can  assure  you,  has  repeat- 
edly declared  that  if  she  did  not  feel  a  greater  con- 
cern for  the  dangers  which  her  faithful  subjects  and 
her  good  servants  run,  than  for  those  which  threaten 
herself,  she  would  never  consent  that  this  Queen's 
blood  should  be  shed.  We  think  it  very  necessary  to 
inform  you  of  these  sentiments  expressed  not  long 
since  by  her  majesty,  and  to  submit  them  to  your 
good  judgment,  and  so  we  recommend  you  to  the 
Almighty's  protection.'1 

Paulet  received  this  appeal  to  unscrupulous  loy- 
alty, February  2d,  at  evening;  though  an  unfeeling 
jailer,  he  was  alx&gt;ve  cowardly  murder,  and  wrote  in 
reply  : 

"  Having  received  your  letter  of  yesterday  at  five 


MARY  QUEEN  -OF  SCOTS.  401 

o'clock  in  the  afternoon  of  this  day,  I  could  not  fail 
to  send  you  an  answer  with  all  possible  dispatch,  as 
you  direct.  I  send  it  you  in  all  the  bitterness  which 
my  heart  feels  at  being  so  unfortunate  as  to  see  the 
day  when,  by  the  injunctions  of  my  most  gracious 
sovereign,  I  am  required  to  commit  an  act  which  God 
and  the  la\vs  forbid.  My  property,  my  place,  and 
my  life  are  at  her  majesty's  disposal,  and  I  am  ready 
to  surrender  them  to-morrow,  if  such  is  her  good 
pleasure,  acknowledging  that  I  hold  them  from  her 
sole  and  gracious  favor ;  I  do  not  desire  to  enjoy  them 
but  with  the  good  will  of  her  highness.  But  God 
preserve  me  from  making  such  a  pitiable  shipwreck 
of  my  conscience,  or  leaving  so  foul  a  stain  on  my 
posterity,  as  to  shed  blood  without  the  authority  of 
the  law,  and  without  a  public  act.  I  hope  her  ma- 
jesty, with  her  accustomed  clemency,  will  take  my 
loyal  answer  in  good  part." 

Elizabeth,  upon  reading  this  spirited  and  manly 
letter,  uttered  expressions  of  scorn ;  and  had  no  other 
alternative  than  to  let  penalty  reach  its  illustrious 
mark. 

With  the  papers  properly  signed  and  sealed,  the 
members  of  the  privy  council  proceeded  to  the  con- 
cluding deed  in  the  slow  destruction  of  a  beautiful 
and  powerless  Queen.  Mary  was  in  awful  suspense, 
fearing  especially  secret  assassination.  February 
5th,  Robert  Beale,  Elizabeth's  envoy  to  James  VI., 
accompanied  by  the  London  executioner,  arrived  at 
Fotheringay  Castle.  He  acquainted  the  castellans 
with  his  mission,  and  then  hastened  to  the  Earls  of 
Kent  and  Shrewsbury,  who  were  to  see  the  sentence 
executed  on  the  morning  of  the  8th.  About  noon  of 


402  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

the  7th,  all  the  actors  in  the  approaching  scene  of 
blood  were  assembled  in  the  castle.  Alarm  seized 
the  servants,  as  the  signs  of  the  dreaded  consumma- 
mation  gathered  alx»ut  them.  Mary  was  on  her 
couch  in  bodily  weakness  and  pain.  The  Earls  re- 
quested to  see  her;  and  she  replied,  though  ill,  if  it 
were  donned  necessary,  she  would  meet  them.  When 
'told  delay  was  not  permitted,  she  dressed  herself,  and 
seated  by  a  small  work  talile,  calmly  awaited  their 
e&lt; niiing.  Her  limited  retinue  was  around  her.  The 
grand  marshal  of  England,  followed  hy  Hoale  and  the 
jailers,  entered  the  room  uncovered  and  Ixnving,  and 
told  the  mournful  captive  that  the  sentence  delayed 
more  than  two  months,  could  no  longer  lx&gt;  deferred; 
that  Elixaln-th  was  forced  to  the  execution  of  it  by  the 
clamor  of  her  subjects,  and  they  had  come  to  do  her 
will. 

Mary  serenely  listened,  and  then  desired  Beale  to 
read  the  warrant  for  the  execution : 

Warrant  for  the  Execution  of  tlie  Queen  of  Scott. 

"  Elizabeth,  by  the  grace  of  God,  Queen  of  England,  France, 
and  Ireland,  Ac.  To  our  trusty  and  well  beloved  cousins, 
George,  Earl  of  Shrewsbury,  Earl  Marshal  of  England,  Henry, 
Earl  of  Kent,  Henry,  Earl  of  Derby,  George,  Earl  of  Cumber-

"  Whereas  sithence  the  sentence  given  by  you,  and  others 
of  our  Council,  Nobility  and  Judges,  against  the  Queen  of 
Scots,  by  the  name  of  Mary,  Daughter  of  James  the  Fifth. 
late  King  of  Scots,  commonly  called  the  Queen  of  Scots,  and 
Dowager  of  France,  as  is  to  you  well  known  ;  all  the  States 
in  the  last  Parliament  assembled  did  not  only  deliberately,  by 
great  advice,  allow  and  approve  the  same  sentence  as  just  and 
honorable,  but  also  with  all  humbleness  and  earnestness  pos- 
sible, at  sundry  times  require,  solicit  and  press  us  to  direct 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  403 

such  further  execution  against  her  Person,  as  they  did  ad- 
judge her  to  have  duly  deserved  ;  adding  thereunto,  that  the 
forbearing  thereof  was,  and  would  be  daily,  certain  and  un- 
doubted danger,  not  only  unto  our  own  life,  but  also  unto 
themselves,  their  posterity,  and  the  public  estate  of  this 
Realm,  as  well  for  the  cause  of  the  Gospel  and  true  Religion 
of  Christ,  as  for  the  peace  of  the  whole  Realm  ;  whereupon 
we  did,  although  the  same  were  with  some  delay  of  time, 
publish  the  same  Sentence  by  our  Proclamation,  yet  hitherto 
have  forborn  to  give  direction  for  the  further  satisfaction  of 
the  aforesaid  most  earnest  reqviests,  made  by  our  said  States 
of  our  Parliament ;  whereby  we  do  daily  understand,  by  all 
sorts  of  our  loving  subjects,  both  of  our  Nobility  and  Council, 
and  also  of  the  wisest,  greatest,  and  best  devoted  of  all  sub- 
jects of  inferior  degrees,  how  greatly  and  deeply,  from  the 
bottom  of  their  hearts  they  are  grieved  and  afflicted,  with 
daily,  yea  hourly  fears  of  our  life,  and  thereby  consequently 
with  a  dreadful  doubt  and  expectation  of  the  ruin  of  the 
present  happy  and  godly  estate  of  this  Realm,  if  we  should 
forbear  the  further  final  execution,  as  it  is  deserved,  and 
neglect  their  general  and  continued  requests,  prayers,  coun- 
sels and  advices,  and  thereupon,  contrary  to  our  natural 
disposition  in  such  case,  being  overcome  with  the  evident 
weight  of  their  counsels,  and  their  daily  intercessions,  im- 
parting such  a  necessity,  as  appeareth,  directly  tending  to 
the  safety  not  only  of  ourself,  but  also  to  the  weal  of  our 
whole  Realm;  we  have  condescended  to  suffer  justice  to 
take  place,  and  for  the  execution  thereof  upon  the  special 
trusty  experience  and  confidence  which  we  have  of  your 
loyalties,  faithfulness  and  love,  both  toward  our  Person  and 
the  safety  thereof,  and  also  to  your  native  countries,  whereof 
you  are  most  noble  and  principal  Members,  we  do  will,  and 
by  "Warrant  hereof  do  authorize  you,  as  soon  as  you  shall

where  the  said  Queen  of  Scots  is  in  custody  of  our  right  trusty

pleased  and  contented,  and  hereby  we  do  will,  command,  and 
authorize  our  Chancellor  of  England,  at  the  requests  of  \&lt;&gt;u 
all  and  every  of  you,  the  duplicate  of  our  Letters  Patents,  to 
be  to  all  purposes  made,  dated,  and  sealed  with  our  Great 
Seal  of  England,  as  these  Presents  now  are. 

"  In  witness  whereof,  we  have  caused  these  our  Letters  to 
be  made  Patents.  Given  at  our  Manor  of  Greenwich,  the  1st 
day  of  February,  in  the  twenty-ninth  year  of  our  Reign." 

When  the  reading  was  finished,  Mary  made  the 
sign  of  the  cross,  and  said : 

"  God  be  praised  for  the  news  you  bring  me.  I 
could  receive  none  better,  for  it  announces  to  me  the 
conclusion  of  my  miseries,  and  the  grace  which  God 
has  granted  me  to  die  for  the  honor  of  his  name,  and 
of  his  church,  Catholic,  apostolic,  and  Roman.  I 
did  not  expert  such  a  happy  end,  after  the  treatment 
I  have  suffered  and  the  dangers  to  which  I  have  been 
exptsed  for  nineteen  years  in  this  country — I,  born 
a  Queen,  the  daughter  of  a  king,  the  grand-daughter 
of  Henry  VII.,  the  near  relation  of  the  Queen  of 
England,  Queen  Dowager  of  France,  and  who, 
though  a  free  princess,  have  been  kept  in  prison  with- 
out legitimate  cause,  though  T  am  subject  to  nobody, 
and  recognize  no  superior  in  this  world,  excepting 
God." 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  405 

Mary  laid  her  hand  upon  a  Testament,  and  reaf- 
firmed that  she  never  sought,  nor  consented  to  any 
means,  of  taking  Elizabeth's  life.  When  the  Earl 
of  Kent  remarked  that  she  swore  on  a  Papal  book, 
she  immediately  answered :  "  It  is  the  book  in  which 
I  believe ;  do  you  suppose  my  oath  would  be  more 
sincere  if  I  took  it  on  yours,  in  which  I  do  not  be- 
lieve? "  She  spurned  the  proposal  to  send  the  Dean 
of  Peterborough,  a  Protestant,  to  attend  her  in  the 
dying  hour,  but  desired  her  own  confessor,  who  had 
been  taken  from  her  several  days  before.  The  wish 
was  basely  disregarded.  She  then  asked  when  she 
was  to  die ;  the  Earl  of  Shrewsbury  answered,  "  To- 
morrow, madam,  about  8  o'clock  in  the  morning." 

The  earls  departed,  and  Mary's  servants  crowded 
about  her,  weeping  with  breaking  hearts.  She  soon 
after  partook  of  an  early  supper,  and  called  her  at- 
tendants to  the  apartment.  Pouring  out  wine,  she 
drank  to  them,  and  with  expressions  of  warm  affec- 
tion, asked  from  them  a  similar  pledge  of  love.  They 
fell  on  their  knees,  and  poured  out  their  tears  afresh, 
*as  the  last  libation  upon  the  altar  of  fidelity.  They 
besought  her  to  pardon  all  offences.  She  assured 
them  of  free  forgiveness,  and  hoped  they  would  ex- 
tend the  same  charity  to  her. 

She  then  retired  to  spend  the  night  in  writing  and 
prayer.  Near  the  dawn  of  day  she  completed  her 
will,  which  ran  as  follows : 

"  In  the  name  of  the  Father,  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy 
Ghost,  I,  Mary,  by  the  grace  of  God,  Queen  of  Scotland  and 
Dowager  of  France,  being  on  the  point  of  death,  and  not 
having  any  means  of  making  my  will,  have  myself  committed 
these  articles  to  writing,  and  I  will  and  desire  that  they  have 
the  same  force  as  if  they  were  made  in  due  form, 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

"In  the  first  place,  I  declare  that  I  die  in  the  Catholic, 
Apostolic,  and  Romish  faith.  First,  I  desire  that  a  complete 
service  be  performed  for  my  soul  in  the  church  of  St.  Denis, 
in  France,  and  another  at  St.  Peter's,  at  Rheims,  where  all 
my  servants  are  to  attend  in  such  manner  as  thej  may  be 
ordered  to  do,  by  those  to  whom  I  have  given  directions,  and 
who  are  named  herein. 

"  Further,  that  an  annual  obit  be  founded  for  prayers  foi 
my  soul,  in  perpetuity,  in  such  place,  and  after  such  manner, 
as  shall  be  deemed  most  convenfent. 

"To  furnish  funds  for  this.  I  will  that  my  houses  at  Fon- 
tainebleau  be  sold,  hoping  that  the  king  will  render  me  as- 
sistance, as  I  have  requested  him  to  do  in  my  memorandum. 

"  I  will  that  my  estate  of  Trespagny  be  kept  by  my  cousin 
de  Guize,  for  one  of  his  daughters,  if  she  should  come  to  be 
married.  In  these  quarters  I  relinquish  half  of  the  arrears 
due  to  me,  or  a  part,  on  condition  that  the  other  be  paid  in 
order  to  be  expended  by  my  executors  in  perpetual  alms. 

"  To  carry  this  into  effect  the  better,  the  documents  shall 
be  looked  out,  and  delivered  according  to  the  assignment  for 
accomplishing  this. 

"  I  will  also  that  the  money  which  may  arise  from  my  law- 
suit with  Secondat  be  distributed  as  follows  : 

"  First,  in  the  discharge  of  my  debts  and  orders  hereafter 
mentioned,  and  which  are  not  yet  paid  ;  in  the  first  place,  the 
two  thousand  crowns  to  Courle ;  which  I  desire  to  be  paid  • 
without  any  hesitation,  they  Wing  a  marriage  portion,  upon 
which  neither  Nau  nor  any  other  person  has  any  claim,  what- 
ever obligation  he  may  hold,  inasmuch  as  it  is  only  fictitious, 
and  the  money  is  mine  and  not  borrowed,  which  since  I  did 
but  show  him,  and  afterward  withdrew  it,  and  it  was  taken 
from  me,  with  the  rest,  at  Chartelay  ;  the  which  I  gave  him, 
provided  he  can  recover  it,  agreeably  to  my  promise,  in  pay- 
ment  of  the  four  thousand  francs  promised  at  my  death,  one 
thousand  as  a  marriage  portion  for  an  own  sister,  and  he 
having  asked  me  for  the  rest  for  his  expenses  in  prison.  As 
to  the  payment  of  a  similar  sum  to  Nau,  it  is  not  obligatory, 
and,  therefore,  it  h;is  always  been  my  intention  that  it  should 
be  paid  last,  and  then  only  in  case  he  should  make  it  appear 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  407 

that  he  has  not  acted  contrary  to  the  condition  upon  which 
I  gave  it  him,  and  to  which  my  servants  were  witnesses. 

"  As  regards  the  twelve  hundred  crowns,  which  he  has 
placed  to  my  account,  as  having  been  borrowed  by  him  for 
my  use,  six  hundred  of  Beauregard,  three  hundred  of  Gervais, 
and  the  remainder  from  I  know  not  whom,  he  must  repay 
them  out  of  his  own  money,  and  I  must  be  quit,  and  my  order 
annulled,  as  I  have  not  received  any  part  of  it,  consequently 
it  must  be  still  in  his  possession,  unless  he  has  paid  it  away. 
Be  this  as  it  may,  it  is  necessary  that  this  sum  should  revert 
to  me,  I  have  received  nothing  ;  and  in  case  it  has  not  been 
paid  away,  I  must  have  recourse  to  his  property.  I  further 
direct,  that  Pasquier  shall  account  for  the  moneys  that  he 
has  expended  and  received  by  order  of  Nau,  from  the  hands 
of  the  servants  of  Monsieur  de  Chasteauneuf ,  the  French  am- 
bassador. 

"  Further,  I  will  that  my  accounts  be  audited,  and  my 
treasurer  paid. 

"Further,  that  the  wages  and  sums  due  to  my  household, 
as  well  for  the  last  as  for  the  present  year,  be  paid  them 
before  all  other  things,  both  wages  and  pensions,  excepting 
the  pensions  of  Nau  and  Courle,  until  it  be  ascertained  what 
there  is  remaining,  or  whether  they  have  merited  any  pensions 
from  me,  unless  the  wife  of  Courle  be  in  necessity,  or  be  ill 
treated  on  my  account :  the  wages  of  Nau  after  the  same 
manner. 

"  I  will  that  the  two  thousand  four  hundred  francs  which 
I  have  given  to  Jeanne  Kenedy  be  paid  to  her  in  money,  as 
it  was  stated  in  my  first  deed  of  gift,  which  done,  the  pension 
of  Volly  Douglas  shall  revert  to  me,  which  I  give  to  Fontenay 
for  services  and  expenses  for  which  he  has  had  no  compensa- 
tion. 

"  I  will  that  the  four  thousand  francs  of  that  banker's  be 
applied  for  and  repaid ;  I  have  forgotten  his  name,  but  the 
Bishop  of  Glascou  will  readily  recollect  it ;  and  if  the  first 
order  be  not  honored,  I  desire  that  another  may  be  given  on 
the  first  money  from  Secondat. 

"  The  ten  thousand  francs  which  the  ambassador  has 
received  for  me,  I  will  that  they  be  distributed  among  my 
servants  who  are  now  going  away,  viz.  :

Rheims.

tion of  the  king.

for.     I  will  that  his  father  be  paid  his  wages,  and  leave  him 
five  hundred  francs. 

"  I  will  that  one  thousand  francs  be  paid  to  Gourgeon,  for 
money  and  other  things  with  which  he  supplied  me  in  my

day, 8th  of  February,  1587. 

"  Signed,  MARY  QUKKM.  " 

Nothing,  perhaps,  could  give  a  better  illustration 
of  the  clearness  of  Mary  Stuart's  intellect  on  the 
verge  of  old  age,  and  the  tranquillity  of  her  spirit  in 
view  of  death,  than  the  preparation  of  this  minute 
document.  Officers  of  the  realm  were  sleeping  with- 
in those  silent  walls;  King  James  was  reposing  in 
Holyrood  Palace;  the  scaffold  was  the  place  of  her 
next  appearing  before  men  ;  and  yet  she  moved  her 
facile  pen  without  trembling  or  wandering  thought 
Depositing  her  papers  in  a  casket,  she  applied  her- 
self to  preparation  for  the  block,  and  remarked,  she 
must  think  only  of  appearing  before  God. 


CHAPTER  X. 

THE  almoner  of  Mary,  according  to  her  request, 
spent  the  midnight  hours  in  prayer,  and  sent  her  his 
absolution.  She  read  in  the  Lives  of  the  Saints,  and 
pausing  with  emotion  over  the  story  of  the  penitent 
thief,  remarked :  "  He  was  a  great  sinner ;  but  not  so 
great  as  I  am.  I  beseech  our  Lord,  in  memory  of  his 
passion,  to  have  remembrance  and  mercy  of  me,  as 
he  had  of  him,  in  the  hour  of  death." 

She  then  sought  repose,  to  obtain  strength  for  the 
coming  trial  of  her  courage  and  immortal  hopes. 
Amid  the  tears  and  prayers  of  her  women,  the  illus- 
trious prisoner  slept.  As  the  beams  of  morning  stole 
through  the  guarded  windows  upon  her  pale  and 
mournful  features,  a  smile  of  martyr-triumph  passed 
over  them.  Whatever  her  true  rank  in  the  scale  of 
moral  being,  she  felt  herself  to  be  an  offering  to  God 
in  the  service  of  the  Catholic  church.  Rising  in  this 
twilight  of  opening  day,  she  said  she  had  only  two 
hours  to  live ;  and  immediately  commenced  prepara- 
tions for  the  scaffold.  Selecting  a  golden-fringed 
handkerchief  for  the  bandage  to  cover  her  eyes,  she 
arrayed  her  form  in  solemn  magnificence.  The  ser- 
vants were  gathered  about  her — the  will  read,  and 
the  gifts  of  affection  committed  to  their  care;  while 
she  lavished  on  them  jewelry,  and  purses  of  coin, 
adding  expressions  of  consolation  to  alleviate  the 
grief  of  separation. 

Withdrawing  from  the  weeping  company,  she  went 
411 


412  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

to  the  oratory,  where  .-he  wa-  accustomed  t«&gt;  U»w  with 
her  spiritual  counselor,  In-fore  lie  was  u  n  feeling  I  v 
taken  from  her.  The  supplications  of  the  dying  wen- 
falling  from  her  lips,  when  the  .-miniums  of  her  exe- 
cutioners disturbed  the  earnest  worshiper.  She  de- 
sired to  finish  her  devotions,  and  was  allowed  to  con- 
tinue them.  In  a  few  moments  the  knocking  was 
renewed,  and  the  sheriff  entered.  Advancing  to 
Mary,  who  had  not  moved,  he  lifted  his  white  wand, 
and  said,  "  Madam,  the  lords  await  you,  and  have 
sent  me  to  you."  She  rose  from  her  knees,  and  re- 
plied, "  Yes,  let  us  go."  One  of  the  attendants 
handed  her  an  ivory  crucifix  from  the  altar;  kissing 
the  symbol,  she  ordered  it  to  be  carried  before  her  to 
the  place  of  execution. 

Leaning,  in  her  weakness,  on  two  of  her  servants, 
she  reached  the  limits  of  her  own  apartments,  when 
they,  with  great  delicacy  of  feeling,  fell  into  the  pro- 
cession of  mourners,  and  left  her  to  the  servitors  of 
the  jailer.  At  the  staircase  which  led  to  the  hall  of 
death  below,  the  servants  were  commanded  to  pause ; 
entreaties  to  follow  the  Queen  were  in  vain;  and 
rushing  to  her  feet,  they  clung  with  sobs  to  her  dress, 
until  forcibly  removed.  Bearing  in  one  hand  a 
prayer-book,  and  the  cross  in  the  other,  with  serene 
and  majestic  mien  she  descended  the  steps,  in  her 
widow's  apparel;  "A  gown  of  dark  erimson  velvet 
with  black  satin  corsage,  from  which  chaplets  and 
scapula ries  were  suspended,  and  which  was  sur- 
mounted by  a  cloak  of  figured  satin  of  the  same  color, 
with  a  long  train  lined  with  sable,  a  standing  up 
collar  and  hanging  sleeve*.  A  white  veil  was  thrown 
over  her,  reaching  from  her  head  to  her  feet." 


MARY  QUEEN  OP  SCOTS. 

When  she  entered  the  hall  Andrew  Melvil,  her 
maitre  d'hoid,  met  her  to  bid  her  farewell.  Kneel- 
ing with  uncontrollable  grief,  Mary  embraced  him, 
and  with  words  of  gratitude  for  his  fidelity,  charged 
him  to  give  a  true  record  of  what  was  transpiring,  to 
James  VI.,  her  son.  He  answered,  "  It  will  be  the 
most  sorrowful  message  I  ever  carried,  to  announce 
that  the  Queen,  my  sovereign  and  dear  mistress,  is 
dead."  With  a  faint  smile  she  said,  "  Thou  shouldst 
rather  rejoice,  good  Melvil,  that  Mary  Stuart  has  ar- 
rived at  the  close  of  her  misfortunes.  Thou  knowest 
that  this  world  is  indeed  full  of  troubles  and  misery. 
Bear  these  tidings — that  I  die  firm  in  my  religion,  a 
true  Catholic,  a  true  Scotch-woman,  a  true  French- 
woman. May  God  forgive  those  who  have  sought  my 
death.  The  Judge  of  the  secret  thoughts  and  actions 
of  men  knows  that  I  have  always  desired  the  union 
of  England  and  Scotland.  Commend  me  to  my  son, 
and  tell  him  I  have  never  done  anything  that  could 
prejudice  the  welfare  of  the  kingdom,  or  his  quality 
as  a  King,  nor  derogate  in  any  respect  from  our  sov- 
ereign prerogative." 

Turning  to  the  Earls  of  Shrewsbury  and  Kent,  she 
requested  pardon  for  her  secretary,  Curie,  and  that 
the  servants  might  attend  her  to  the  scaffold.  The 
earls  expressing  a  fear  of  trouble  on  account  of  their 
wild  sorrow,  and  that  they  might  attempt  to  dip  their 
handkerchiefs  in  her  blood :  she  replied :  "  My  lords, 
I  pledge  my  word  that  they  will  do  nothing  of  the 
kind.  Alas !  poor  souls,  they  will  be  gratified  at 
taking  leave  of  me ;  and  I  am  sure  your  mistress,  be- 
ing a  virgin  Queen,  would  not  refuse  to  allow  another 
Queen  to  have  her  women  about  her  at  the  moment 


1 1  \  MAUY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

»(  her  death.  She  cannot  have  given  yon  such  rigor- 
ous orders.  You  would  j;rant  UK-  more  than  that 
even  if  I  were  a  person  of  lower  rank;  and  yet,  my 
1« »r« Is,  you  know  that  I  am  your  Queen's  eou-in.  You 
certainly  will  not  refuse  me  this  last  request.  My 
poor  girls  desire  no  more  than  to  see  me  &lt;! 

The  dying  wish  wa&gt;  granted,  and  she  selected  Bur- 
goin,  her  physician;  (Jorion,  her  apothecary;  Ger- 
vais,  her  surgeon ;  Didier,  her  hutler ;  Jean  Kennedy 
ami  Elizabeth  Curie.  Melvil  hore  the  train  of  the 
Queen's  dress.  The  scaffold  was  two  feet  and  a  half 
high,  twelve  feet  square,  ami  covered  with  black  cloth. 
The  chair,  cushion  on  which  she  was  to  kneel,  and 
the  block,  were  all  overlaid  with  the  same  sombre 
drajK-ry.  With  as  much  dignity,  repose  of  manner, 
and  gracefulness,  as  though  ascending  a  throne,  Mary 
-tepped  upon  the  scaffold,  and  sat  down  in  the  chair 
of  death. 

On  her  right  hand  were  seated  the  earls;  on  her 
left  stood  the  sheriff;  the  two  executioners  were  in 
front,  dressed  in  black  velvet,  and  the  servants  lined 
the  walls;  while  two  hundred  people  from  the  adja- 
cent country  crowded  the  barred  area  of  the  silent 
hall.  It  was  a  sad  and  moving  sight.  The  fallen 
Queen,  with  the  outline  of  fading  beauty  still  visi- 
ble, around  whose  fate  in  that  gloomy  castle  there  was  { 
a  world-wide  interest,  sat  calmly  beholding  the* 
throng,  and  awaiting  the  fatal  stroke.  Beale  then 
read  the  sentence,  to  which  Mary  listened  unmoved. 

When  it  was  concluded,  she  made  the  sign  of  the 
cross,  and  &lt;;\\i\  in  clear  accents: 

"  My  lords,  T  am  a  Queen  l&gt;orn,  a  sovereign  prin- 
cess, not  subject  to  the  laws,  a  near  relation  of  the 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  415 

Queen  of  England,  and  her  lawful  heiress.  After 
having  been  long  and  unjustly  detained  prisoner  in 
this  country,  where  I  have  endured  much  pain  and 
evil,  though  nobody  had  any  right  over  me,  being 
now,  through  the  strength  and  under  the  power  of 
men,  ready  to  forfeit  my  life,  I  thank  God  for  per- 
mitting me  to  die  for  my  religion,  and  in  presence  of 
a  company  who  will  bear  witness  that,  just  before  my 
death,  I  protested,  as  I  have  always  done,  both  in 
private  and  in  public,  that  I  never  contrived  any 
means  of  putting  the  Queen  to  death,  nor  consented 
to  anything  against  her  person." 

She  added  again  her  denial  of  enmity  toward  any, 
and  of  designs  against  Elizabeth.  Engaging  in  fer- 
vent prayer,  the  Protestant  dean,  Dr.  Fletcher,  inter- 
rupted her,  and  exhorted  her  to  prepare  to  die.  Re- 
jecting his  offices,  she  told  him  that,  firm  in  the  Cath- 
olic faith,  she  expected  to  shed  her  blood  for  it.  He 
urged  her  to  repent,  when  Mary  indignantly  bade 
him  be  silent.  The  earls  then  said  they  wished  to 
offer  prayer  in  her  behalf. 

She  answered,  "  My  lords,  if  you  will  pray  with 
me,  I  will  even  from  my  heart  thank  you,  and  think 
myself  greatly  favored  by  you ;  but  to  join  in  prayer 
with  you  in  your  manner,  who  are  not  of  one  religion 
with  me,  it  were  a  sin,  and  I  will  not."  Thus  did  the 
Eeformation  battle  with  Papacy  on  the  platform  of 
bloody  penalty.  The  Dean  proceeded  with  the  fol- 
lowing eloquent  petition : 

"  Oh,  most  gracious  God  and  merciful  father,  who,  accord- 
ing to  the  multitude  of  thy  mercies,  dost  so  put  away  the  sins

-\  1  r,  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS. 

this  person  appointed  unto  death,  whose  eyes  of  understand- 
ing and  spiritual  light,  albeit  thou  hast  hitherto  shut  up,  that 
the  glorious  beams  of  thy  favor  in  Jesus  Christ  do  not  shine 
upon  her,  but  is  possessed  with  blindness  and  ignorance  of 
heavenly  things  (a  certain  token  of  heavy  displeasure,  if  thy 
unspeakable  mercy  do  not  triumph  agairmt  thy  judgment) 
&lt;)  L«&gt;nl  our  &lt;Jc»d,  impute  not,  we  beseech  thee.  unto  her 
those  her  offences,  which  separate  her  from  thy  m&lt;  i 
and,  if  it  may  stand  with  thine  everlasting  purpose  and  good 
pleasure,  O  Lord,  grunt  unto  us,  we  beseech  thee,  this  m&lt;  : 
which  is  all- mi  thy  throne,  that  the  eyes  of  her  heart  may  be 
enlightened,  that  she  may  be  converted  unto  thee  ;  and  grant 
her  also,  if  it  be  thy  blessed  will,  the  heavenly  comfort  of  thy 
Holy  Spirit,  that  she  may  taste  and  see  how  gracious  the  Lord 
is.  Thou  hast  no  pleasure,  good  Lord,  in  the  death  of  a  sin- 
ner, and  no  man  shall  praise  thy  name  in  the  pit ;  renew  in 
her,  O  Lord,  we  most  humbly  beseech  thy  majesty,  whatso- 
ever is  corrupt  in  her,  either  by  her  own  frailty,  or  by  the 
malice  of  the  ghostly  enemy  ;  visit  her,  O  Lord,  if  it  be  thy 
good  pleasure,  with  thy  saving  health,  as  thou  didst  the  of- 
fender at  the  side  of  thy  cross,  with  this  consolation  :  This 
day  shalt  thou  be  with  me  in  Paradise.  Say  unto  her  soul,  as 
thou  didst  unto  thy  servant  David,  I  am  thy  salvation  :  so 
shall  thy  mercy,  being  more  mighty,  be  more  magnified. 
Grant  these  mercies,  O  Lord,  to  us  thy  servants,  to  the  in- 
crease of  thy  kingdom,  and  glory  at  this  time.  And  further, 
O  most  merciful  Father,  preserve,  we  most  humbly  beseech 
thy  majesty,  in  long  and  honorable  peace  and  safety,  Eliza- 
beth thy  servant,  our  most  natural  sovereign  lady  and  queen  ; 
let  them  be  ashamed  and  confounded,  O  Lord,  that  seek  after 
her  soul ;  let  them  be  turned  backward  and  put  to  confusion 
that  wish  her  evil ;  and  strengthen  still,  Lord,  we  pray  thee, 
the  hand  and  balance  of  justice  amongst  us,  by  her  gracious 
government ;  so  shall  we  both  now  and  ever,  rest  under  1 1 
faithfulness  and  truth,  as  under  our  shield  and  buckler,  ai 
bless  thy  name  and  magnify  thy  mercy,  which  livest  ati-. 
reignest  one  most  gracious  God,  for  ever  and  ever.  Amen." 

Mary  did  not  heed  the  Dean,  but  Ixnred  in  devotion 
till  he  ceased,  when,  records  a  spectator : 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  417 

"  She  rose,  and  kneeled  downe  agayne,  praying  in  English, 
for  Christe's  afflicted  church,  an  end  of  hir  troubles,  for  hir 
sonne,  and  for  the  Queen's  majestye  ;  to  God  for  forgiveness 
of  the  sinns  of  them  in  this  islancle  :  Shee  forgave  hir 
ennemyes  with  all  hir  harte,  that  had  longe  sought  hir  blood. 
This  done,  she  desired  all  saintes  to  make  intercession  for  hir 
to  the  Saviour  of  the  worlde,  Jesus  Christ.  Then  she  began 
to  kiss  hir  crucifix,  and  to  cross  hirself ,  saying  these  wordes  : 
'  Even  as  thy  armes,  oh,  Jesus  Christ,  were  spredd  heer  upon 
the  cross,  so  receive  me  into  the  armes  of  mercye.'  Then 
the  two  executioners  kneeled  downe  unto  hir,  desiring  hir  to 
forgive  them  hir  death.  Shee  answered,  "  I  forgive  yow  with 
all  my  harte.  For  I  hope  this  death  shall  give  an  end  to  all 
my  troubles.'  They,  with  hir  two  weomen  helping,  began  to 
disroabe  hir,  and  then  shee  layde  the  crucifix  upon  the  stoole. 
One  of  the  executioners  took  from  her  neck  the  Agnus  Dei, 
and  shee  layde  hold  of  it,  saying,  she  would  give  it  to  one  of 
hir  weomen,  and,  withal,  told  the  executioner  that  he  should 
have  monye  for  it.  Then  they  took  off  her  chayne.  Shee 
made  hirself  unready  with  a  kinde  of  gladness,  and  smiling, 
putting  on  a  payer  of  sleeves  with  her  own  handes,  which 
the  twoo  executioners  before  had  rudely  put  off,  and  with 
such  speed,  as  if  shee  had  longed  to  be  gone  out  of  the 
worlde. 

"  During  the  disroabing  of  this  queen,  shee  never  altered 
hir  countenance,  but  smiling  sayde.  shee  never  had  such 
groomes  before  to  make  hir  unreadye,  nor  ever  did  putt  of 
hir  cloathes  before  such  a  companye.  At  lengthe  unattyred 
and  unapparrelled  to  hir  petticoat  and  kirtle,  the  two  weomen 
burst  out  into  a  great  and  pittiful  shrieking,  crying  and 
lamentation,  crossed  themselves  and  prayed  in  Lattine.  The 
queen  turned  towards  them  :  '  Ne  cry  vous,  j'ay  preye  pur 
vous: '  and  so  crossed,  and  kissed  them  and  bad  them  pray 
for  hir. 

"  Then  with  a  smiling  countenance  shee  turned  to  her  men 
servants,  Melvin  and  the  rest,  crossed  them,  badd  them  far- 
well,  and  pray  for  her  to  the  last. 

"One  of  the  weomen  having  a  Corpus  Christ!  cloathe, 
lapped  it  upp  three  corner  wise,  and  kissed  it,  and  put  it  over 
the  face  of  hir  queen,  and  pynned  it  fast  upon  the  caule  of

hir  head.  Then  the  two  weomen  departed.  Tlie 
kneeled  downe  upon  the  cushion  resolutely,  and.  without  any 
token  of  feare  of  death,  sayde  allowde  in  Lattin  the  psalm.  . 
In  te  doming,  coiifulo.  Then  groaping  for  the  block,  she 
layde  down  hir  head,  putting  hir  cheane  over  her  back  with 
bothe  her  handes,  which,  holding  their  still,  had  been  cut  off, 
had  they  not  been  eepyed. 

"  Then  she  layde  hirself  upon  the  blocke  most  quietly,  and 
stretching  out  hir  annes,  cryed  out :  In  manus  tuax,  domine 
commendo  spirit  urn  mcuni,  three  or  four  tyrnes. 

"  Att  last,  while  one  of  the  executioners  held  hir  streightly 
with  one  of  his  liandes,  the  other  gave  two  stroakes  with  an 
axe  before  he  did  cutt  of  hir  head. 

"Shee  made  very  smale  noyse,  no  part  stirred  from  the 
place  where  shoe  laye.  The  executioners  lifted  upp  the  head 
and  bad  God  save  the  Queen.  Then  hir  dressinge  of  Lawne 
fell  from  hir  head,  which  appeared  as  graye  as  if  she  had 
byn  thre  score  and  ten  yeares  olde.  Hir  face  much  alt  red, 
hir  lipps  stirred  upp  and  down  almost  a  quarter  of  an  bower 
after  hir  head  was  cut  off.  Then  sayde  Mr.  Deane : '  So  perish 
all  the  Queen's  ennemyes.'  The  Earl  of  Kent  camme  to  the 
dead  body,  and  with  a  lower  voice  sayde,  '  Such  end  happen 
to  all  the  Queen's  and  GoHpell's  ennemyes.'  One  of  the 
executioners  espyed  hir  little  dogg  which  was  crept  under 
hir  cloathes,  which  would  not  be  gotten  fourth  but  with  force, 
and  afterwardes  would  not  departe  from  the  dead  corps,  but 
camme  and  layde  between  hir  head  and  shoulders ;  a  thing 
much  noted.  The  dogg  embrewed  in  her  blood  was  carryed 
awaye  and  washed,  as  all  things  els  were  that  had  any  blood, 
save  those  thinges  which  were  burned.  The  executioners 
were  sent  awaye  with  mony  for  their  fees,  not  having  any 
one  thyng  that  belonged  unto  hir.  Afterwardes  every  one 
was  commanded  forth  of  the  hall,  saving  the  Sherife  and  his 
men,  who  carryed  hir  up  into  a  great  chamber  made  ready 
for  the  Surgeons  to  embalme  hir,  and  there  shee  was  em- 
balmed." 


The  "  things  burned  "  were  the  golden  cross,  the 
ehnplets  suspended  to  her  girdle,  and  the  apparel  in

which  she  was  beheaded,  that  they  might  not  be  kept 
as  relics  by  her  friends  of  like  faith. 

The  castle  gates  were  closed,  and  none  allowed  to 
depart,  until  Henry  Talbot,son  of  the  Earl  of  Shrews- 
bury, was  dispatched  to  Elizabeth  Avith  the  account 
of  the  tragedy.  He  reached  Greenwich,  where  Eliz- 
abeth then  was,  February  9th,  1587.  Before  sunset 
the  news  spread  over  London ;  the  ringing  of  bells 
and  illuminations  proclaimed  the  wild  and  fanatical 
rejoicings  of  the  populace. 

The  funeral  pageant  is  described  by  an  eye-witness 
of  the  imposing  ceremonies : 

FUNERAL  AND  INTERMENT   OP  MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.* 

"  On  Sunday,  the  30th  of  July,  reckoning  according  to  the 
new  reformation  of  the  calendar,  the  8th  of  August,  1587, 
about  eight  o'clock  in  the  evening,  there  came  to  Fotheringay 
Castle,  a  carriage  drawn  by  four  horses,  attired  in  mourning, 
and  covered  with  black  velvet  with  the  arms  of  Scotland,  the 
carriage  or  coach  covered  in  like  manner  all  round  with  small 
banneroles,  exhibiting  partly  the  arms  of  Scotland,  partly 
those  of  the  house  of  An jou,  from  which  the  deceased  husband 
of  her  majesty  was  descended.  The  king  of  the  heralds 
having  arrived  with  about  twenty  men  on  horseback,  both 
gentlemen  and  others,  and  some  servitors  and  lacqueys,  all 
dressed  in  mourning,  went  up  to  the  chamber  where  the 
corpse  was,  directed  it  to  be  carried  down  and  put  into  the 
same  carriage,  which  was  done  with  all  possible  reverence, 
all  bare-headed  and  in  silence  ;  while  this  was  doing,  the 
servants,  to  whom  no  notice  had  been  given,  astonished  at 
these  preparations,  were  consulting  among  themselves  whether 
they  ought  to  follow  the  body  to  see  what  was  going  to  be 
done  with  it,  deeming  that  it  was  not  their  duty  to  let  it  be  car- 
ried away  without  being  accompanied  by  some  of  them,the  said

king  of  the  heralds  went  and  explained  to  them  the  com* 
mission  winch  In-  had  received  from  hi.s  mistress,  touching 
the  interment  of  the  body  and  the  funeral  which  she  had 
promised,  for  which  he  had  been  commanded  to  make  ar- 
rangements, and  to  pay  all  the  honors  to  the  deceased  that 
hecould.  \Vlicrcii|Nin,  wishing  to  comply  with  tl&gt;- 
tions,  and  having  already  prepared  many  things  necessary 
for  this  purpose,  it  was  thought  more  expedient  to  it-move 
the  corpse  that  night,  than  to  wait  till  the  day  fixed  for  ;t  - 
interment,  which  was  the  following  Tuesday,  as  well  on  ac- 
count of  the  dist.uic.-.  which  was  about  three  French  leagues 
from  thence,  and  because  the  leaden  coffin  would  be  too 
heavy  to  be  carried  in  state,  and  it  could  not  take  place  on 
the  day  appointed,  without  collecting  a  great  concourse  of 
people,  and  producing  confusion,  or  default  of  some  kind  ; 
and  as  the  vault  was  already  made,  they  proposed  to  deposit 
the  body  in  it  this  night,  and  on  the  Tdesday  to  perform 
the  funeral  obsequies  with  due  ceremony,  for  the  greater 
convenience;  and  that  it  was  advisable  for  some  of  them, 
Mich  as  they  should  think  proper,  to  accompany  the  corpse, 
and  to  see  what  should  be  done  with  it,  and  that  the  rest  of 
the  servants  should  go  thither  next  day  to  attend  the  funeral 
on  the  day  appointed. 

••  All  being  thus  prepared,  the  corpse  was  carried  out  about 
ten  o'clock  at  night,  accompanied  by  the  said  herald  and  other 
English,  with  seven  servants  of  her  majesty,  namely,  Mon- 
sieur Melvin,  Monsier  Burgoin,  Pierre  Corion,  Annibal  Sto- 
nard,  Jean  Lander,  and  Nicolas  de  la  Mare,  preceded  by  men 
on  foot  bearing  lighted  torches,  to  give  light  on  the  road,  and 
arrived  about  two  in  the  morning  at  Peterbourg,  which  IB  • 
small  town,  not  walled  any  more  than  the  other  towns  of 

England,  on  the  river, where  has  been  built 

a  very  handsome  church,  the  work  of  an  ancient  king  of  Eng- 
land named  Peda.*    Here,  in  the  times  of  the  Catholic  reli- 

*"The  present  building  of  the  Peterborough  cathedral  is 
the  third  church  on  this  site.  The  first  was  founded  by  Peada, 
King  of  Mercia.  in  056,  as  a  Benedictine  monastery,  which 
afterward^-  li.-caiii'-  one  of  the  im»st  important  of  the  English 
alibeys.  This  church  was  destroyed  by  the  Danes  in  870-3.

gion,  there  was  an  abbey  of  monks  of  St.  Benedict,  now  erected 
into  a  bishopric—  for  all  the  abbeys  have  been  suppressed — 
where  canons  officiate  to  their  institution,  in  the  same  sort  of 
dress  and  vestment  as  ours. 

"  In  this  church  was  interred  that  good  Queen  Catherine, 
wife  of  the  late  King  Henry  VIII.,  on  the  left  side  within  the 
choir,  where  there  is  still  her  monument,  adorned  with  a 
canopy,  with  her  armorial  bearings.  On  the  right  side,  exactly 
opposite,  was  made  a  grave,  bricked  all  round,  and  of  sufficient 
depth,  wherein  was  deposited  the  corpse  of  her  majesty  in 
the  two  coffins.  In  the  middle  of  the  choir  was  erected  a 
dome,  resembling  the  chapelles  ardents  in  France,  excepting 
that  it  was  covered  witli  black  velvet,  garnished  all  over  with 
the  arms  of  Scotland,  with  bipartite  banneroles,  as  it  has  been 
said.  Within  it  was  placed  the  representation,  which  was  in 
the  form  of  a  bier  covered  with  black  velvet,  and  upon  it  a 
pillow  of  crimson  velvet,  on  which  was  laid  a  crown.  The 
church  was  hung  with  black  cloth,  from  the  door  to  the  in- 
terior of  the  choir,  sprinkled  with  the  said  armorial  bearings. 

"  On  the  arrival  of  the  body,  the  bishop  of  the  said  town  of 
Peterbourg,  in  his  episcopal  habit,  but  without  mitre,  crosier 
or  cope,  with  the  dean  and  some  others  in  their  canonicals, 
came  to  receive  the  body  at  the  entrance  of  the  church,  and 
preceded  it  to  the  said  grave,  in  which  it  was  put  in  the  pres- 
ence of  all,  without  chanting  or  tolling,  or  saying  a  word  ;  and 
then  they  deliberated  about  saying  some  customary  prayers, 
but  agreed  to  defer  them  till  the  day  of  the  funeral.  The 
workmen  immediately  set  about  making  an  arch  of  brick  over 
the  grave,  which  covered  the  whole,  level  with  the  ground, 
leaving  only  an  aperture  of  about  a  foot  and  a  half,  through 
which  might  be  seen  what  was  within,  and  also  for  admitting 
the  broken  staves  of  the  officers  and  the  flags,  which  it  is 
customary  to  put  down  at  the  funerals  of  sovereigns. 

"  On  Monday,  the  preparations  were  completed  ;  the  rooms 
in  which  the  banquet  was  to  be  held  were  hung,  and  the 
herald  requested  the  servants  who  had  come  hither  to  look  at 

The  second  was  founded  in  971  and  burned  down  in  1116. 
The  oldest  part  now  standing  is  the  choir,  consecrated  about

and  consider  the  whole,  explaining  how  he  intended  to  pro- 
ceed ;  that  if  they  saw  anything  wanting,  anything  that 
needed  amending  or  correcting,  whatever  it  might  be,  that 
they  thought  not  proper,  and  it  should  be  made  to  their  satis- 
faction ;  that  such  was  the  pleasure  of  liis  mistress,  that 
nothing  was  to  be  spared  ;  and  that  if  he  had  failed  to  obey 
these  directions  it  would  be  his  fault,  wishing  the  whole  to  be 
done  in  the  most  honorable  manner  possible.  Whereto 
answer  was  very  coldly  made,  that  it  was  not  for  them  t&lt;&gt; 
find  fault ;  that  his  mistress  and  he  were  discreet  enough  to 
do  what  was  right,  as  they  had  agreed,  and  that  the  whole 
was  dependent  on  their  pleasure. 

"  The  Queen  of  England  had  some  days  before  sent  cloth  to 
make  mourning  for  the  servants  of  her  majesty,  as  much  as 
was  necessary  for  the  men  to  make  a  cloak  apiece  for  Mon- 
sieur Melvin,  Monsieur  Bourgoin,  and  a  gown  for  each  of  the 
women,  but  some  of  them  declined  it,  making  shift  with  their 
own  dresses,  which  they  had  got  made  for  mourning  im- 
mediately after  the  death  of  the  deceased,  and  as  the  head- 
dresses of  the  ladies  and  women  were  not  according  to  the 
fashion  of  the  country  for  mourning,  a  woman  was  sent  on 
purpose  to  make  others  in  their  fashion,  to  be  worn  by  them 
on  the  day  of  the  funeral,  and  to  be  theirs  afterward  ;  so 
anxious  was  that  sweet  Elizabeth  to  have  it  believed  that  she 
was  sorry  for  the  death  of  her  majesty,  that  she  furnished  all 
the  mourning  dresses  worn  by  those  who  walked  in  the  pro- 
cession, more  than  three  hundred  and  fifty  in  number,  paying 
the  whole  expense." 

The  procession  was  composed  of  "  poor  women 
mourners  to  the  number  of  one  hundred,"  the  nobil- 
ity, with  their  attendants,  grooms  of  the  chamber, 
Scots  in  cloaks,  officers  of  the  realm,  and  the  corpse, 
borne  by  six  esquires  in  cloaks.  In  the  procession 
were  borne  the  standard  of  Scotland,  the  great  ban- 
ner, the  helm,  crest,  target,  sword,  coat,  etc.,  together 
with  eight  banneroles,  and  the  canopy,  of  black  velvet, 
fringed  with  gold,  borne  by  four  knights. 


MARY  QUEEN  OF  SCOTS.  423 

•'  The  body  being  thus  brought  into  the  quire,  was  set  down 
within  the  royal  hearse,  which  was  twenty  feet  square,  and 
twenty-seven  feet  in  height,  covered  over  with  black  velvet, 
and  richly  set  with  escutcheons  of  arms  and  fringe  of  gold  ; 
upon  the  body,  which  was  covered  with  a  pall  of  black  velvet, 
lay  a  purple  velvet  cushion,  fringed  and  tasseled  with  gold, 
and  upon  the  same  a  close  crown  of  gold  set  with  stones  ; 
after  the  body  was  thus  placed,  and  every  mourner  according 
to  their  degree,  the  sermon  was  begun  by  the  Bishop  of  Lin- 
coln, after  which  certain  anthems  were  sung  by  the  choir, 
and  the  offering  began  very  solemnly,  as  followeth: 

"  The  Offering. 

"  First,  the  chief  mourner  offered  for  the  queen,  attended 
upon  by  all  ladies.  The  coat,  sword,  target,  and  helme,  was 
severally  carried  up  by  the  two  Earls  of  Rutland  and  Lincoln, 
one  after  another,  and  received  by  the  Bishop  of  Peterborough, 
and  Mr.  Garter,  king  at  arms. 

The  standard  alone. 

The  great  banner  alone. 

The  lady  chief  mourner  alone. 

The  trayne-bearer  alone. 

The  two  earls  together. 

The  lord  steward.    The  lord  chamberlayne. 

The  Bishop  of  Lincoln  alone. 

The  four  lords  assistants  to  the  body. 

The  treasurer,  comptroller,  and  vice-chamberlayne. 

The  four  knights  that  bore  the  canopy. 
"  In  which  offeringe  every  course  was  led  up  by  a  herald, 
for  the  more  order  ;  after  which,  the  two  bishops  and  the 
Dean  of  Peterborough  came  to  the  vault,  and  over  the  body 
began  to  read  the  funeral  service  :  which  being  said,  every 
officer  broke  his  staff  over  his  head,  and  threw  the  same  into 
the  vault  to  the  body  ;  and  so  every  one  departed,  as  they 
came,  after  their  degrees,  to  the  bishop's  palace,  where  was 
prepared  a  most  royal  feast,  and  a  dole  given  unto  the  poor." 

Delivered  from  one  cause  of  fear,  Elizabeth  was 
tormented  with  apprehensions  of  danger  from  the  for- 
eign princes,  whose  protest  she  had  scorned.  Affect-

ished the  agents  of  her  cruel  work.  She  rv.  i, 
nie.l  either  knowledge  or  approval  of  the  execution. 
France  heard  with  surprise  and  sadness  of  the  event, 
and  anathemas  were  thundered  by  tin-  priesthood 
against  the  "English  Jezebel."  Tin-  kini:  of  Scot- 
land, in  hot  indignation,  declared  vengeance  upon  the 
slayer  of  his  mother.  The  Queen  wrote  letters  of 
explanation  and  conciliation.  Philip  II.  seriously 
indulged  the  design  of  avenging  Mary's  death.  The 
grand  armada,  and  its  destruction,  were  the  fruits  of 
his  anger.  Elizabeth,  victorious  over  all  enemies, 
advanced  the  grandeur  and  glory  of  England.  When 
dying,  March  24th,  1602,  she  was  desired  to  declare 
her  successor;  she  replied,  "Who  but  my  kinsman, 
the  King  of  Scot-  '.  "  She  soon  after  expired,  a 
learned,  powerful,  vain,  haughty,  violent,  and  dis- 
simulating sovereign.  She  sleeps  beside  her  rival 
in  Westminster  Abbey. 

Mary  Stuart  was  born  while  her  father,  James  V., 
was  sinking  with  a  fatal  wound  received  in  battle  for 
the  independence  of  Scotland.  Around  her  cradle 
began  the  contest,  whether  a  French  alliance  or  the 
house  of  Tudor  should  prevail.  .France  for  a  while 
was  triumphant,  and  gave  to  Mary  all  .the  happiness 
she  ever  knew.  She  ascended  the  throne  of  Scotland, 
while  the  Reformation  was  rocking  her  native  soil 
with  earthquake-  violence.  With  the  refinement  and 
corruption  of  a  dazzling  court  affect  ing  her  manners 
and  feelings,  and  a  witching  beauty  of  person,  she 
had  no  sympathy  with  either  the  customs  or  religion 
of  her  Protestant  subjects.  Gallantries  made  her  ob- 
noxious to  the  contempt  of  the  Puritans,  and  weak-

ened  her  influence  with  the  people.  Unfortunate  in 
her  marriages,  impulsive  in  her  passions,  ambitious 
in  her  aims,  and  a  firm  Catholic,  she  lost  her  crown 
at  the  hand  of  the  Reformers,  and  imprudently  threw 
herself  upon  the  mercy  of  Elizabeth,  whose  successor 
she  determined  to  be.  Plots  and  conspiracies  com- 
pleted her  ruin,  which  unyielding  rivalry  sealed  with 
blood. 

Mary  Stuart  was  a  charming  woman  in  mind,  dis- 
position, and  conversation.  But  an  impure  breath 
801163"  her  young  heart ;  soaring  aspirations  lured  her 
ever  onward  from  one  doubtful  experiment  to  an- 
other; and  adherence  to  an  exclusive,  persecuting 
faith  lent  the  delusive  zeal  of  the  fanatic  to  her  re- 
ligious life.  Her  unfilial  son  attained  to  the  honor 
she  so  ardently  desired  for  him,  and  both  have  slept 
during  the  fierce  commotions  of  centuries,  in  the  mag- 
nificent tomb  of  kings.  Both,  with  the  imperious 
Elizabeth,  have  confronted  a  Judge  who  is  no  re- 
specter of  persons,  and  renders  to  each  immortal, 
righteous  judgment.  To  the  blind  and  to  the  im- 
partial admirer  of  Mary,  there  is  alike  a  picture  of 
female  character,  amid  whose  brilliant  lines  and 
gloomy  shades  there  are  touches  of  life's  pencil,  sug- 
gestive of  chastening  thoughts,  and  illustrative  of  the 
transcendent  excellence  of  Christian  purity  and  prin- 
ciple, which  would  have  adorned  and  saved  from  pre- 
mature wreck,  her  genius,  love  and  beauty.
