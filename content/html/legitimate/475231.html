<p>We are moving all of our site and company news into a single blog for Sports Reference.  We'll tag all Basketball-Reference content, so you can quickly and easily find the content you want. </p>
<p>Also, our existing Basketball-Reference blog rss feed will be redirected to the new site's feed, so you won't need to change a thing on your end.</p>

				<p>By now, you've probably seen <a href="index344b.html?p=9923">Sean's post about the BBR Blog</a> (if not, go read it first)... We had a great run here (going back to the <a href="index5e74.html?p=45">start of the 2008-09 season</a>), and while it's unfortunate that we have to shut the blog down, I'm really proud of the work we did over the past 3 seasons.</p>
<p>So, in that spirit, I'd like to say thanks and give you some final stats about the blog:</p>

				<p>One of the tough parts of running a business is deciding when to put more effort into something and when to not. We know we've been pretty silent here since the end of the season, and after a lot of internal debate, we've decided to stop posting editorial content on the BBR blog.</p>
<p>This obviously has nothing to do with the quality of the content produced by lead writer, Neil Paine. His posts were phenomenal, and I know many readers looked forward to them every week. A big thanks to Neil for making this such a vital place for basketball discussion and analysis. As a small company, focus is vital for our success, and we are choosing to focus our energy on pumping out as much statistical basketball data as possible and that means cutting back in other areas.</p>
<p>None of the existing content is going to go away. We'll keep it up here for as long as the site is open (which we intend to be a very long time). If you would like to contact Neil, he's available at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#086678487b78677a7c7b257a6d6e6d7a6d666b6d266b6765"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="036d734370736c7177702e7166656671666d60662d606c6e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Thank you most of all for your patronage.</p>

			<p class="date">Posted by Justin Kubatko on October 14, 2011</p>

			<div class="entry">

				<p>Unlike the NBA, the Basketball-Reference.com programming staff (that would be me) does not want to lock out its fans.  In light of that, let me describe some new features that were added to the site this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have noticed that the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/billuch01.html">player pages</a> once again have similarity scores tables.  Please read the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/similar.html">description of the method</a> for full details.</li>
<li>On the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi">Player Season Finder</a>, you can now filter your results based on whether or not the player was an All-Star game selection (single season queries) or the number of All-Star game selection for the player (combined season queries).  There is also a more flexible way to filter by position.  Previously, you only had four options: any, guard, forward, or center.  Now, you can select any combination of these.  For example, you can restrict your results to players who are listed as either a "G-F" or "F-G" in the database.</li>
<li>On the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi">Player Game Finder</a>, you can now search for cumulative totals.  For example, you can search for the player with the <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/zMdFZ">most points scored in the first ten games of the 2010-11 season</a>.  You can also choose to combine regular season and playoff games in your search (previously you had to choose one or the other).  There is also a new way to filter by position that is the same as the one described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy these new features, and as always, please <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/feedback/">let us know</a> if you find any bugs.</p>

<p>In an effort to better serve our users, we've posted a feedback form on our overall company site, http://www.sports-reference.com.</p>
<p>In addition to your feedback, we are looking for a couple dozen volunteers to sign on for occasional, additional surveys and perhaps some early beta testing of new features. We are calling these volunteer groups Sports Reference User Boards. You can still give us feedback without having an interest in being on a user board.</p>
<p>Thank you, as always, for your support and feedback.</p>

				<p>This is just a quick post to let you know that I have added a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/trades.cgi">Trade Partners</a> script to the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/">Frivolities</a> section of the site.  Simply select two franchises from the search form and you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>all of the trades between the two franchises;</li>
<li>the statistics for each player on their "old" and "new" teams; and</li>
<li>a summary of the number of Win Shares coming and going in the deal.</li>

<p>I hope you enjoy this new feature, and as always please <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/feedback/">contact us</a> should you have any comments or questions.</p>

				<p>Nathan emailed us this question today:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I stumbled across the 97-98 Cavaliers page for some reason and noticed that during that season they started Wesley Person, Shawn Kemp, Cedric Henderson, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Brevin Knight, with Derek Anderson starting 13 games. So that's 8th-year player Kemp, 3rd-year player Person, and 4 rookies in the top 6 in terms of starts! And they made the playoffs!</p>
<p>That has to be the highest percentage of games started by rookies right (discounting the first few seasons of the NBA)?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately our complete start data only goes back to 1983, so I can't speak to teams from early in the NBA's existence (except to say that, obviously, everyone would be a rookie in 1949-50). Since 1983, though, here are the teams that gave the most starts to 1st-year players:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idarko.com/hoopstream/">Hoop Stream</a></p>
<p>It's pretty cool -- you can use it to follow the Twitter accounts of all active players on a given team, plus retired players as well.</p>
