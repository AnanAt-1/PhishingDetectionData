<H3>Automated baggage system</H3>
The airport's computerized baggage system, which was supposed to reduce flight delays, shorten waiting times at luggage carousels, and save airlines in labor costs, turned into an unmitigated failure. An airport opening originally scheduled for October 31, 1993, with a single system for all three concourses turned into a February 28, 1995, opening with separate systems for each concourse, with varying degrees of automation.<br />
<br />
The system's $186 million original construction costs grew by $1 million per day during months of modifications and repairs. Incoming flights on the airport's B Concourse made very limited use of the system, and only United, DIA's dominant airline, used it for outgoing flights.

Between February  and August 2008, construction of an on-site, two-megawatt&nbsp; solar energy&nbsp;system took place. The single-axis tracking system provides 3.5 million kilowatt-hours&nbsp;of energy per year  and uses 9,200 solar panels&nbsp;made by Sharp. Originally designed to power a jail, it spares the environment of more than five million pounds of carbon emissions&nbsp;annually.  The system generates the equivalent of half the energy needs of the underground trains that move people between concourses.  The $13 million-plus  system sits on 7.5 acres (or 30,000 m<sup>2</sup>), clearly visible to people entering and exiting the airport.  WorldWater & Solar Technologies Corp. designed and built the system, while MMA Renewable Ventures LLC—rather than DIA—owns the solar farm and sells its energy to the airport. Denver International Airport’s three solar array systems now produce approximately six percent of the airport’s total power requirements.  The output makes DEN the largest<br />

This was achieved by designing an easily expandable midfield terminal and concourses, creating one of the most efficient airfields in the world.<br />
<br />
At 33457 acres (13,540 ha), DIA is by far the largest land area commercial airport in the United States. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport&nbsp;is a distant second at 18100 acres (7,325 ha).

This layout allows independent flow of aircraft to and from each runway without any queuing or overlap with other runways. Additional runways can be added as needed, up to a maximum of 12 runways. Denver currently has four north/south runways (35/17 Left and Right; 34/16 Left and Right) and two east/west runways (7/25 and 8/26).<br />

<div class='thumb tleft'><img src='http://image.absoluteastronomy.com/images/encyclopediaimages/k/kd/kden_airportdiag.png'/></div>
DIA's sixth runway (16R/34L) is the longest commercial precision-instrument runway in North America with a length of 16000 feet (4,877 m). Compared to other DIA runways, the extra 4000 feet (1,219.2 m) length allows fully loaded jumbo jets such as the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("80630",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("80630")' href="/topics/Boeing_747">Boeing 747</a><span class="hp" id="m80630"><div class="hpHeader">Boeing 747</div><div class="hpContent">The Boeing 747 is a wide-body commercial airliner and cargo transport, often referred to by its original nickname, Jumbo Jet, or Queen of the Skies.

As part of the original design of the airport the city specified passenger volume "triggers" that would lead to a redevelopment of the master plan and possible new construction to make sure the airport is able to meet Denver's needs. The city hit its first-phase capacity threshold in 2008, and DIA is currently revising the master plan. As part of the master plan update, the airport announced selection of Parson's transportation group to design a new hotel, rail station and two bridges leading into the main terminal. <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("22461",this,"santiago_calatrava.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("22461")' href="/topics/Santiago_Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a><span class="hp" id="m22461"><div class="hpHeader">Santiago Calatrava</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i22461"></div>Santiago Calatrava Valls  is a Spanish architect, sculptor and structural engineer whose principal office is in Zürich, Switzerland.

The airport collects landing fees, rent and other revenues from the airlines to help offset its operating costs. Denver International Airport is owned and operated by the City and County of Denver, but does not operate using tax dollars. Instead, the airport is an "enterprise fund" generating its own revenues in order to cover operating expenses. The airport operates off of revenue generated by the airlines – landing fees, rents and other payments – and revenues generated by non-airline resources – parking, concessions revenues, rent and other payments.<br />

In the mid-1990s, Philip Schneider gave lectures about highly secretive government information concerning "deep underground military bases" that were constructed by the United States government, and said that one of these bases exists underneath the Denver International Airport. Author Alex Christopher claimed to have worked in the tunnels under the airport, and described what appeared to be vast holding areas for prisoners, strange nausea-inducing electromagnetic forces, and caverns big enough to drive trucks through, presumably to be filled with helpless political prisoners. This theory has been challenged, since photos have revealed that these tunnels are used for transportation of baggage by way of conveyor belts<br />
<br />
People have found out that there have been unusual markings in the terminals in DIA and have recorded them as masonic markings. One person found these markings and traced them to a series of tunnels where people believe were built shortly after the airport was built in the 1980s.<br />
<br />
Conspiracists have pointed to unusual words cut into the floor as being Satanic, Masonic, or just some impenetrable secret code of the New World Order: <i>Cochetopa, Sisnaajini</i>, and the baffling <i>Dzit Dit Gaii</i>. These words are actually Navajo terms for geographical sites in Colorado. "Braaksma" and "Villarreal" are actually the names of Carolyn Braaksma and Mark Villarreal, artists who worked on the airport’s sculptures and paintings.<br />
