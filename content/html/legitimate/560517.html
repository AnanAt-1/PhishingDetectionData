                <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-center display-7">Charles Lilly Jr., 44, of Hendersonville, Tenn., and formerly of the Beckley (WV) area, died from injuries he sustained when a van he was riding in ran off Interstate 65 south of Montgomery and flipped several times, according to Alabama highway troopers. <br><br>Lilly, the son of Everett Lilly, was a bass guitar player with the Grand Ole Opry legend Billy Walker, who was also killed in the accident. "Charles Lilly was a great bass player and singer,” said Dick McVey, a fellow musician from Nashville. “He was a good guy and an outstanding friend.”<br><br>In addition to Lilly and Walker, the accident claimed the life of Walker’s wife, Bettie Walker, 61, and band member Daniel Patton Sr., 40, of Hermitage, Tenn.  Walker’s grandson, Joshua Brooks, 21, also of Hendersonville, was injured in the accident. He remains in critical condition at Vanderbilt hospital, officials said.
<br>
<br>Billy Walker, whose hits included “Charlie’s Shoes” and “Cross the Brazos at Waco,” was 77. 
<br>
<br>The group was on its way back to the Nashville area after performing at a show near Gulf Shores, according to McVey.  They were regulars at the Grand Ole Opry, but during the summer they would perform at various fairs, festivals, and other road shows,” McVey said. “This accident is a tragedy and my sympathies go out to all their families.”
<br>
<br>Walker’s road shows usually involved Lilly on bass and Patton on lead guitar. The two band members also sang harmony with Walker.
<br>
<br>McVey said Charles Lilly often attended the annual Lilly reunion at Flat Top in West Virginia.  “He used to play and bring Nashville musicians with him,” he said. “His musical talents and abilities, along with his connections to the Lilly Brothers, gave him an outstanding recognition and respect in Nashville. He will be truly missed.”
<br>
<br>(<em>The Associated Press contributed to this story</em>.)
<br>
<br>According obituary information on the funeral home’s Web site, Lilly started his music career with Everett Lilly and "Clear Creek Crossin'". He played for Joe Diffie and on the Grand Ole Opry for 11 years and played for numerous other Opry stars, including the legendary Johnny Russell.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>He was a current member of the Billy Walker band named "The Tennessee Walkers".  Most recently he was also a member of a trio named "Lee, Weller and the Other Guy", with Dickey Lee and Freddie Weller.  Charles also had his own band that played locally called "Formally With".  
<br>
<br>Charles owned his own construction company, SLI, Inc., and was an accomplished craftsman.  Charles left his handiwork in the homes and hearts of so many.  Not a day went by that Charles didn't perform a good deed for someone.
<br>
<br>Charles was preceded in death by his brothers Jiles Lilly and Tennis Lilly.  He is survived by his wife Karen Lilly, sons Charles A. Lilly, Aaron Lilly and Richard Bailey (who was like a son); parents Everett and Jo Ann Lilly, brothers Everett Alan Lilly (Karen), Daniel Lilly (Sylvia) and Mark Lilly (Donna); sisters Diana Tomah (Dennis), Laverne O’Loughlin and Karen Pierangenlo.
<br>
<br>He is also survived by Father-in-law Glen A. Stover and wife, Lana; Brothers-in-law Chris Stover (Tara), Mark Stover (Kelly), and many nieces and nephews that he loved so dearly.
