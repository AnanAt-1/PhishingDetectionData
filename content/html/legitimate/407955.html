He told one of his bosses “If we have layoffs, I call dibs.” Unfortunately, that never happened, so he had to continue to write and make movies on nights and weekends. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eHe wrote his first short script \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBrobot\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, a somewhat autobiographical story where instead of a kid telling his little brother he’s adopted, he tells him he’s a robot slave.

Who wouldn’t want to see George Washington riding into the Battle of Trenton on a Sherman Tank instead of his horse? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eJeff went on to attend Drew University, and despite taking writing courses in college he graduated and became a corporate lackey, doing a quick stint on Wall Street and spending late nights and weekends working on his writing craft, something that kept him sane. As time went by he felt his writing was becoming stronger but wasn’t sure if it was quite there yet. So, like many other fearless, aspiring television writers before him, Jeff chose the most expensive back up plan in the world and went to law school. While law school had many positive effects on Jeff’s writing (structure, lying…sorry storytelling), it also gave him the opportunity to continue to write over breaks, and during the week when he probably should have been studying. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter getting some much-needed advice from working television writers – who were alumni of his high school – Jeff decided that the best way to see where he stood in the pantheon of television scribes was to submit to the Nickelodeon Writing Program. After writing a script on some highly questionable material, Jeff played the waiting game for months, finally seeing that 818 area code come up on his phone. A few cross-country flights and eleven some odd interviews later, Jeff is a writer in the Nickelodeon Writing Program! He is so pumped to be at Nick that he re-watched the Are You Afraid of the Dark DVD he bought off of E-bay in college (which still scares the crap out of him) and has been blasting “Hey Sandy”- the theme song from The Adventures of Pete and Pete – on repeat.

He heard from a lot of different psychiatric and behavioral professionals about what was ‘wrong’ with him – and yet, whenever he was writing, those ‘problems’ just seemed to disappear. The paper and the pen allowed him to get out of his head. Television had the same effect. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCharlie’s romance with TV was more passionate than even the most robust Nicholas Sparks novel. There was nothing he enjoyed more than being whisked away to an entirely different reality, populated by hilarious characters and absurd situations. TV was full of his favorite vacation spots: New New York from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFuturama\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, Ba Sing Se from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAvatar: The Last Airbender\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, and even the dingy Manhattan municipal courthouse on \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNight Court\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. In-between these sporadic getaways, Charlie realized that the people creating these worlds were the people he wanted to be. So at the ripe age of 12, he decided to stop wasting his life trying to catch every Pokemon in Gold/Silver version and instead get more serious about writing as an actual career. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn high school, Charlie’s extracurricular activities were almost exclusively related to his desire to write. On campus, he contributed to his school’s literary magazine. Off campus, he went out of his way to connect with mentors who taught him more about screenwriting and the behind-the-scenes world of television. He was also on the track team \u0026#8212; but who cares about that. He only joined it so he wouldn’t have to take P.E. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAs soon as he graduated, Charlie was faced with a tough decision. He could either move away for school or stay in Los Angeles, the hub of the entertainment industry, and commit himself to his dream. He made the gutsy call to continue on his path and in the next few years he worked doing freelance assignments like script coverage and writing descriptive blurbs for the back of DVD cases. Both were super boring, but provided worthwhile experience (maybe not the DVD thing). In addition to that, he took classes at UCLA Extension to learn more about the craft and build a portfolio of his own scripts, stories, and essays. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNow, as a writer in the Nickelodeon Writing Program, Charlie is immensely excited to tackle this new challenge and not just take a vacation in TV, but be a part of it.

It could go either way, honestly. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"pageHeaderBlock":{"__typename":"Alum_Postpageheaderblock","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCharlie was born in Los Angeles and quickly made it his life goal to take over Hollywood. Not really. But he did always love to write. That’s probably not a huge shocker. In elementary school, he was content to merely stitch together short comics about a ball with feet (the only character he could consistently draw). Charlie would sell every issue of his spherical hero’s adventures to his classmates for 25 cents each. By the fifth grade, he had over five dollars banked. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","backgroundTextColor":"#00d8d0","featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Placeholder","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10152958/Lane-Garrison._FeaturedMemberProfile_Missing.jpeg_FeaturedMemberProfile_Missing-copy.jpeg","title":null},"backgroundImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Writing-Program-Header","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105554/NAS-nwp-header.jpg","title":null},"backgroundImageMobile":null,"backgroundImageStyle":"cover","backgroundColor":null,"socialLinks":null}}},{"__typename":"Program_Program_alumni","alum":{"__typename":"Alum","id":"cG9zdDozNDU3","slug":"jeff-trammel","title":"Jeff Trammel","alum":{"__typename":"Alum_Alum","startClassDate":"2015","endClassDate":"2016","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter quickly finding out that taking beatings was nowhere near as fun as dishing them out, Kevin Kavalier reverted back to Jeff and hung up his shiny black boots.

While he learned about the technical side of the business, Jeff had no idea how to write for TV. Armed with grit, determination, and a shoddy internet connection, Jeff looked up every book, script and website he could find in order to learn how to write comedy television. During this time, Jeff and his friend Todd created a YouTube sketch comedy group known as Reel Jokers. Reel Jokers was an unabashed hit, leading to both men retiring at the tender age of 21. Actually, Reel Jokers currently has 55 subscribers and neither man has ever made a dime from it, but they had fun making videos. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhile pursuing his dream of a successful writing career, Jeff worked as an airport ramp agent, a security guard, and an \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAll That\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e cast member… well, not the last one. While working these jobs, Jeff took an interest in comic books and entered a contest that required he write the origin story of a major villain.

Jeff couldn’t believe such a program existed and how amazing it seemed. Motivated and full of stories, Jeff was ready to get cracking and submit his script… until he noticed he’d missed that year’s deadline by a month. He considered destroying his computer in a fit of rage; instead he decided to prepare for the next year’s cycle \u0026#8211; with a vengeance! With focus, months of preparation, and no Plan B, Jeff submitted his extremely raunchy script based on “The League” and tried not to think about it every second for the next six months. Finally, the call that would change his life came in August, and three thousand miles and eleven interviews later, Jeff became a member of the exclusive Nickelodeon Writing Program.

And she never got up. Well, figuratively. She would go on to write all kinds of things, like a collection of haikus, and a set of monologues which got transformed into a play by the very same, now much prouder, teacher. She continued along this path all the way to the end of high school.

Loneliness! Even more jokes! After graduation, she moved back to Finland because even though her heart and suitcase were heavy, her wallet was light. If she had thought that the Finnish academia was unwelcoming, boy was she in for a surprise with the job market! She did small handyman jobs in anything that would let her write. Ice hockey jumbotron jingles! Translating birthing partner guides! Blog posts on weddings!

It debuted at the Helsinki Comics Festival, and Milla was amazed that its first printing sold out in a day. Even more amazingly, she soon learnt that her spec scripts and rambling [sic] interview anecdotes had earned her a place on the Nickelodeon Writing Program as this year’s international writer!

His first duty was to write in-character MySpace pages for Family Guy’s Peter and Stewie Griffin; a fact he recalls somewhat reluctantly, as it shows his age.

When years of unrequited teenage crushes culminated in a failure to get into university, she panicked. A guy Joanna was seeing at the time saw that she was lost and disillusioned, and he feared she was putting all her emotional eggs in one basket: him. He called things off, but knowing she was a poet and short story writer, he said, ‘Joanna, you have a direction. It’s writing. I’m taking you out for dinner in a month’s time. Bring me a play.’ A play? In a month? She’d never written a play before, but she went home, sat down and wrote about the breakdown of a relationship. It was cathartic, to say the least. Maybe this is good, she thought, maybe it will win him back. Surprisingly, however, it didn’t. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSo Joanna did what any sane being would do in the face of defeat. She stopped caring about love and success and bought a one-way plane ticket across the world. She ventured through Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand and hiked and kayaked her worries away. She saw every temple, museum, and landmark, ate everything from crickets to deep-fried tarantula to crocodile, drank rice wine, played cards with the locals and even got her belly button pierced despite her phobia for needles. She was trying to prove that she was invincible, that she could have as much fun as she wanted and never get attached to anyone or anything. It didn’t make her invincible ultimately, but it did give her plenty of ammunition as a dramatist. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eEventually Joanna came home from full moon parties and made her way to the University of Saint Andrews, Scotland, home to golf and Prince William’s and Kate Middleton’s blossoming romance. During her time there she churned out six new female-centric plays, this time because she wanted to, and not just because she’d been told. They were put on in a tiny black box theatre and two were even taken to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where they received critical acclaim and won awards, which was very exciting. Joanna then stumbled upon a full scholarship to study Dramatic Writing at NYU, where she fell in love with outlining and structure, and was converted into a TV and screenwriter. She soon found out about the magnificent Nickelodeon Writing Program, which turns emerging writers into superstars. She wrote a spec script for her favourite show, Catastrophe, and after fourteen interviews and one more script, she was amazed to hear that she had been accepted into the program. Joanna has now moved to Los Angeles to pursue her two dreams of writing professionally and tanning her pasty British skin.

One day, Karen Kirkland from Nickelodeon visited Josh’s campus and told him and his classmates about the Nick Writing Program.

She soon realized she needed a more sustainable day job (and probably, a tetanus shot). \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSarah’s love of children and disdain for office attire made nannying a perfect gig.

Sarah didn’t have time to think that was nuts, so she did it. The campaign was a hit and Sarah went on to write over forty film and TV campaigns for multiple agencies. Emboldened, Sarah dipped her toe a bit further into literary waters, penning a nightlife column and writing online profiles of several high-powered orthodontists. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSarah continued to act, performing in a sketch comedy group which was super fun, and auditioning for various “lady with one line” roles which was less fun.

After a summer of binge watching everything from indie rom-coms to historical dramas, she fell in love with the world of TV \u0026amp; film and changed her career plans from college professor to starving artist \u0026#8212; I mean filmmaker. Although it was tough to leave her family and hometown, Halima moved to Los Angeles and enrolled in USC’s School of Cinematic Arts’ MFA Production program.

After all, her short thesis film was nominated for a Student Academy Award. Instead, she ended up sweeping glitter from the floors of Joann’s Fabrics for ten bucks an hour. Somewhere between the angry customers and the constantly clogged toilet, Halima developed a quirky, yet dark sense of humor – likely as a coping mechanism. She found herself thoroughly entertained by the different characters of the store and when she wasn’t at work stocking shelves of construction paper, she was at home channeling the hilarity of her day-to-day experiences into scripts. One fateful day at Joann’s while mopping up parrot poop (because someone just HAD to bring a parrot in the store), Halima spotted someone shoplifting and was instantly inspired. Clearly this person was out there living their “best life,” and maybe now it was time for her to do the same, so she quit. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eShortly after retiring from glitter sweeping, Halima was selected as a fellow for BREAK THE ROOM, a writer’s initiative put on by Nickelodeon Writing Program alum Sameer Gardezi and sponsored by Pop Culture Collab and MuslimARC. There, she and three other writers of color developed and wrote the web series, East of La Brea. It was that first writers’ room experience that made Halima fall in love with writing for television.

To stay awake, he chugged so much Diet Coke that his primary physician once diagnosed him as “Half-Man, Half-Aspartame.” Eventually, Marcus realized that he didn’t feel like his most authentic self there. So, he did what any attorney on partner track would do: leave it all behind for a life in musical theater. He got an M.F.A. by writing musical comedies at NYU and later took TV writing courses with the Upright Citizens Brigade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, as a musical writer, Marcus has co-written animated comedy shorts featuring characters from the video game “Genshin Impact” that have amassed over 20 million YouTube views and 4.5 million Spotify streams to date. As a TV writer, he writes scripts about quirky, nuanced Bolivian protagonists, ranging from a down-on-his-luck actor tired of being typecast as a “narco” to a bad-boy, narcissistic Juilliard professor. As these characters strive to embrace their most authentic selves, they mirror Marcus’s own professional and cultural journeys, while also reflecting his life-long, guiding principle of committing to the bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","backgroundTextColor":"#00d8d0","featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/31151908/Marcus.jpg","title":null},"backgroundImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/31152150/NAS-nwp-header.jpg","title":null},"backgroundImageMobile":null,"backgroundImageStyle":"cover","backgroundColor":"#1e73be","socialLinks":null}}},{"__typename":"Program_Program_alumni","alum":{"__typename":"Alum","id":"cG9zdDo2MjAx","slug":"teddy-sevilla","title":"Teddy Sevilla","alum":{"__typename":"Alum_Alum","startClassDate":"2025","endClassDate":"2025","content":null},"pageHeaderBlock":{"__typename":"Alum_Postpageheaderblock","description":"\u003cp\u003eTeddy Sevilla is a writer and comedian from suburban Massachusetts.

Rather than obsessing over paints, pencils, and paper, she obsessed over two bright, electric boxes: the computer and the television.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFrom playing as superpowered heroes in video games to watching cartoons about the lives of non-human protagonists, the more speculative the fiction, the more she was enraptured. As she grew older, Dominique subliminally absorbed not only a taste for science fiction and fantasy, but an understanding of the status quo present in even the most innocuous content. After investing so many years on the internet, she found a platform that bolstered her creative writing hobby further: fanfiction. Writing for pre-existing worlds progressed into writing and drawing her own characters and by high school years, she had a realization. This burgeoning urge to draft her own works merging with a dissatisfaction with the limited scope of stories reflecting people like her encouraged Dominique to diversify media through her own writing and illustrations.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBy the conclusion of high school, her commitment to a career in visual storytelling earned her acceptance into a handful of art schools and she set off to Moore College of Art \u0026amp; Design as an illustration major. Majoring in illustration introduced Dominique to the field of visual development, yet she could feel the distance from her goals in both her physical location and the non-specific curriculum structure. In hopes she would narrow the focus of her college experience, she added a concept art class to her schedule, invested a merit-based grant into an internship at Moondog Animation Studios, and tailored her senior thesis around development art. Despite all these efforts, upon graduation, she still found herself a bit, well, career-challenged, and for the next several months Dominique chased after sporadic illustration opportunities with the anxiety of impending loan payments looming over her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith financial hardships exacerbating an already stressful living situation, Dominique applied to the Americorps program City Year at the recommendation of a friend, and her service year in Philadelphia was the first of many turning points. After a year of balancing high school classroom support during the day and freelance comic artist at night, she still found herself without an entry-way into animation. She made a decision to return to City Year, with one major change \u0026#8211; she would transfer to the Los Angeles site. Living within the backyard of premiere animation studios had never been so within reach, so she took all those saved City Year stipends and migrated to the opposite side of the country.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAs she transitioned from New Jersey to Los Angeles, Dominique conceptualized a plan: she would submit an application to the Nick Artist Program as a trial run, receive a rejection, and in the aftermath build a solid portfolio that would guarantee acceptance in the following year. In hindsight, this plan makes her laugh, incredulously at that. During the process of her application, that initial plan would constantly be tested and challenged, and ultimately it failed. One application submitted while sitting on a barely furnished apartment room floor lead to several phone and virtual calls, various bouts of crying, an existential crisis, and lastly a triumphant acceptance to join the upcoming the Nick Artist Program Design track. As far away from the Los Angeles landscape as she was, Dominique persisted with this ambition to break into animation, to illustrate for a living, and to simply, wholeheartedly create \u0026#8211; not just for herself, but for the many kids escaping into the stories broadcasted on their computers and televisions, just as she did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"pageHeaderBlock":{"__typename":"Alum_Postpageheaderblock","description":"\u003cp\u003eGeneral Design Track \u0026#8211; 2021\u003c/p\u003e\n","backgroundTextColor":"#00d8d0","featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16201823/DominqueEvans_CaricatureFinal_Profile.png","title":null},"backgroundImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"Dominque Evans","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27122216/DominqueEvans_ext_2021.jpg","title":null},"backgroundImageMobile":null,"backgroundImageStyle":"cover","backgroundColor":"#1e73be","socialLinks":null}}},{"__typename":"Program_Program_alumni","alum":{"__typename":"Alum","id":"cG9zdDo0MDY2","slug":"anh-bui","title":"Anh Bui","alum":{"__typename":"Alum_Alum","startClassDate":"2021","endClassDate":"2022","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDuring Anh’s 4th year of elementary school, her family finally got a TV, so she was exposed to all kinds of fun channels.

Although many things changed in her life, the one constant thing was cartoons. If she wasn’t watching them, she was drawing and making her own.

This was alright at first, but since she drew so much, it was troublesome for her parents who actually needed to use their computers. When high school rolled \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003earound, her parents helped her buy a laptop and tablet, on which she promptly installed Photoshop and Flash.

After moving to California, months were spent taking classes and grinding away on a new portfolio. Angelica did some freelance illustration and made more terrific lifelong friends in LA!

She moved on to watercolor and oil painting classes in high school. With an otherwise normal high school experience when it came time for her to go to college, she realized hadn’t put much thought into what she wanted to do with her life. She figured she would go to a nearby college and wing it. That’s when her father shocked her by suggesting a career in art. So, in 2015, Shannon took the leap and enrolled at DigiPen Institute of Technology, a college where artists, coders, game designers, and sound designers come together and make video games and animated films. There she learned everything about how they are made; most shockingly that 2D animation was created frame by frame, each image drawn on a separate piece of paper.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBy her sophomore year, she still felt directionless as an artist and as a person, but that all changed when she joined a 2D animated film team.

Shannon worked on many aspects of the film from producing, to storyboarding, to 2D animation, and editing. It was like she had woken up. She stayed up until all hours of the night to work on her film, drew until her hand hurt, and even trudged to school over winter break in the snow, in flip flops, uphill both ways.

Getting the chance to tell a story about a young Indian girl in her senior film got her excited about making stories that allowed people to see a part of her and her culture.

Her family valued scientific sensibilities over silly drawings and didn’t understand the world of art and animation. They urged for stability and security. Despite struggling her way through more supplemental math and physics classes than you can imagine, she applied and made it into USC Viterbi School of Engineering.  After an ungodly amount of suffering, last-night cramming, and way too many mental breakdowns to count, Cherrie graduated with an engineering and computer science degree—to the absolute astonishment of her friends and family (\u003cem\u003eespecially\u003c/em\u003e her mother, who had called her every week of undergrad asking if she’d failed out yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting her technical skills to good use, she developed data visualizations for NASA, joined the Google APM program, led new projects on Google Maps and launched YouTube VR on the newest headsets.

Cherrie signed up for an online storyboarding class and it was love at first sight. She couldn’t believe there was a job that so perfectly combined her passion for the visual arts and storytelling! From there she was determined to make the switch into animation. She watched movies, studied cinematography, sketched people non-stop on the trains. Every hour that she wasn’t working, she was drawing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021 Cherrie left her engineering career behind to pursue animation.

The quality of television was much higher in Canada than China, so David watched every show he could from Reboot to Angry Beavers. Before he knew it, he had learned English from the Simpsons, and had become proficient at drawing SpongeBob characters. With his newfound skills, David established himself as the artsy kid, an identity he would carry all through primary and then secondary school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis love for art however, came into direct conflict with his family who were less thrilled about their only child selling commissions to fuel his World of Warcraft addiction. To put him on the right path, they enrolled him in the International Baccalaureate program, an accelerated program where every other kid wanted to go to Harvard or Yale. However, David did not have the intention (nor the ability) to go to an Ivy League school. He had his eyes set on Sheridan College, which was basically Canadian CalArts. When it came time for college, David’s parents refused to fund any art school and only agreed to support him if he got into a more respectable trade. With his animation dream dashed at this point, David went to the University of Toronto to study Computer Science, with one goal in mind: make money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for David, he managed to squeak his way into an internship at the #2 (formerly #1) website in the world: Google. And soon after, he found himself working for Google as a fulltime software engineer. David’s string of good luck would continue as he got placed on the Doodles team, perhaps the only art focused team in the entire company. He went on to work on such Doodles classics such as the 2020 Olympics cat game, the one where you cut a bunch of pizzas, and the one with the turntables. What was especially exciting to him was that he got to work on some of the art as well! Even though he didn’t get paid for any of his art, he was grateful enough for the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinvigorated by his surroundings, David started on his artistic path once more. With his hard-earned disposable income, he took many courses at the Academy of Art University, the Animation Collaborative, and Schoolism.com. He would go deep into Visual Development, but also branched out into Storyboarding and 3D Animation. After six years of toil, thousands of hours spent in front of a Cintiq, and three continuous years of applying to the Nick Artist program, David was selected for the General Design Track. David was finally given the chance of living out his childhood dream.

Her addiction to doodling was fueled by her grandma buying her cheap crayons and markers from the dollar store and coming home and watching the latest episodes of \u003cem\u003eThe Wild Thornberrys\u003c/em\u003e together. Like many kids, she loved cartoons, but it wasn’t until she watched the making of \u003cem\u003eBambi\u003c/em\u003e that sparked her interest in animation.

Coming back to Houston meant giving back to her local community in any shape or form.

She learned how to paint in Photoshop by taking courses on Schoolism and soon after found the opportunity to try out Visual Development through the CTN Production Experience Workshop. There she joined a small crew to help produce the 2D trad-digital animated short film, Cowabunga.

So many things that her mom had to provide her with a sketchbook specifically so she wouldn’t draw on the church pan-flips during service anymore. Throughout her childhood, Trinity had a hunger for animation and storytelling. She was in love with Disney princess movies (heck she knew all the songs backward and forward!).

During school breaks, Trinity would ride her bike every day to the library in sun, snow, and rain (in Michigan you could have all three in one day). From sun-up till sundown, she stayed in the library faithfully reading manga, watching anime, and drawing in one of her many sketchbooks. Nothing could stop her not even the librarians trying to drag her out after they were closed. The library gave her access to everything she loved which fueled her unquenching hunger to create art, and to be around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo surprise she decided to continue her exploration of visual storytelling at College for Creative Studies where she worked on improving her craft in storytelling among lifelong friends and wise teachers.

Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, she spent most of her childhood avoiding playing outside and instead stayed in watching cartoons and engrossed in drawing and coloring books recreating all her favorite animated characters.

Her fantasies and daydreams convinced her that she would someday be able to create her own characters and work on animated films and TV. Somewhere between high school and college however, she started to question her abilities and let her doubts cloud her judgment about how realistic it was to have a career in animation.

By the end of Howdy Week, she realized that she would never forgive herself if she didn’t at least try to pursue her dreams as a character artist. She immediately applied to transfer into the Visualization Program at Texas A\u0026amp;M. Knowing absolutely nothing about Computer Graphics and 3D Art, she quickly found herself in a completely different avenue that she never expected for creating art and characters and bringing them to life. After spending hours completely immersed in Maya for the first time, exploring all the different tools in the software, she realized she was finally where she was meant to be. She spent most of her undergraduate years focusing on 3D modeling for environments, character rigging, and building up her caffeine tolerance. After graduating amidst the pandemic in 2020, she was reminded of how uncertain life could be and decided to pursue her master’s degree at her alma mater as a backup plan so she could still pursue her alter ego’s dream of becoming an old hippie art teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring her time in grad school, she was encouraged to pursue other aspects of CG by her teachers and mentors, which led her to exploring hair creation and look development for characters.

Being the youngest of 11 kids, it was easy to be overshadowed. But when she got some crayons and paper in her hand, she was no longer the quiet crybaby of the family, instead, she was a brave knight fighting a dragon with 10,000 heads, or a wizard who can turn anything pink, or even a lazy basket maker elf whose best friends were the neighborhood birds. No one said these ideas were good of course, but they gave her something to dream of. Shows like \u003cem\u003eAvatar: The Last Airbender\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNaruto,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eTeen Titans\u003c/em\u003e inspired her fantastical stories. Every complex mystery or mesmerizing new world had her hooked from the first frame. It didn’t really make sense to her how adults were making these stories for kids, but as she got older and her notebook was still filled with wizards and princesses, it all clicked. Adults were just kids that got tall and could drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to the most important adults in her life, fantasy and art were not a career option. Her parents expected her to be a doctor or scientist, pushing Meibol until she finally found psychology to be a science interesting enough to study. But right as college applications were coming in with yesses and no’s, Meibol stomped on her parents’ dreams and chose a path that made them start praying for the best – animation. She started her studies at Ringling College of Art \u0026amp; Design as a computer animation major. Still, every day her focus would change. Monday she was an animator, Tuesday a concept artist, Wednesday a modeler, and so on. It wasn’t until she walked into her first story class sophomore year that her world flipped upside down. Here was a branch of animation that was uniquely complex, surprisingly detailed, and not only allowed her to write about lazy elf bird guy, but also DRAW him in action!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, her college life was interrupted when the pandemic forced everyone inside and sent her back home. What was once a comforting home became more of a lifesaving shelter, and real life replaced the magic worlds that would usually float in her head. Despite the fear and chaos, there was a small, but consistent comfort Meibol found at her kitchen table every morning. She was able to spend a lot of time reminiscing with her parents about their journeys in life. How her father came to the US at 21 with nothing but a 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e grade education and 20$ in his pocket, how her mother raised her 4 younger brothers while attending night classes and sewing her own clothes from window curtains and tapestries. Eventually she realized that her parent’s journeys sounded like unbelievable superhero origin stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are stories Meibol grew up hearing for many years, but only now did they really feel heavy. Sure, there’s magic in wizards and dragons, but real magic was something much more meaningful. It’s the feeling in your chest when something totally unfamiliar still resonates with you. Real magic is an authentic and human story. When campuses opened back up, Meibol re-entered her filmmaking journey with a new goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an artist and a storyteller, she was and is still dedicated to creating familiar worlds masked behind fantastic details. Meibol believes animation is a medium of imagination and daydreams, where anyone can see a reflection themselves on screen. She wants to make audiences look past a character’s elf ears or pink skin and instead and get that same tight feeling in their chest that made her think her parents were as unstoppable as superheroes (and maybe still make that story about the lazy elf bird guy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"pageHeaderBlock":{"__typename":"Alum_Postpageheaderblock","description":"\u003cp\u003eStoryboard Path \u0026#8211; 2024\u003c/p\u003e\n","backgroundTextColor":"#fff","featuredImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/08152324/MeibolMoran_Profile.jpg","title":null},"backgroundImage":{"__typename":"MediaItem","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://d2biqbseuutm43.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/08155334/MeibolMoran_Banner.png","title":null},"backgroundImageMobile":null,"backgroundImageStyle":"cover","backgroundColor":"#9c56e2","socialLinks":null}}},{"__typename":"Program_Program_alumni","alum":{"__typename":"Alum","id":"cG9zdDo2MjEx","slug":"lisa-bird","title":"Lisa Bird","alum":{"__typename":"Alum_Alum","startClassDate":"2025","endClassDate":"2025","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-contrast=\"auto\"\u003eGrowing up in a half-Japanese, half-American household, Lisa\u0026#8217;s sense of storytelling was shaped by watching Western and Japanese cartoons and video games from an early age.
