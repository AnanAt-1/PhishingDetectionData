PRELUDE. 

In  April,  1882,  the  author  waa  visiting-  his  lather's  youngest 
brother  (since  deceased),  then  living  near  Harpersville,  Broome 
Count}-,  N.  Y.  When  at  the  barn,  one  morning,  he  happened  to 
ask  the  name  of  his  grandfather.  This  was  given.  He  then 
asked  the  name  of  his  great-grandfather.  "I  do  not  know;  I 
never  heard  it,"  was  the  repl3\  Jokingly  he  said,  "Did  he  have  a 
father?"  "Why  of  course  he  did."  To  this  the  repl}^  was:  "I  am 
going  to  know  his  name." 

How  little  he  tlien  knew  what  that  conversation  meant  for 
him  I  What  3-ears  of  anxious  solicitude,  toil  and  extensive  travel. 
At  that  time  he  did  not  know  there  were  half-a-dozen  families  of 
Beardsleys  in  America  outside  his  own  famil3\ 

Uncle  and  I  soon  returned  to  the  house,  where  I  noted  down 

» 

all  that  he  knew  and  copied  such  records  as  he  possessed. 

After  returning  to  my  home  in  Colorado,  I  adopted  the  plan, 
which  has  been  followed  ever  since,  of  asking  each  person  met, 
"Did  j'^ou  ever  know  an}"^  one  of  my  name?"  Frequentl}'^  the  an- 
swer was:  "Whj",  3'es  ;  I  knew  so  and  so,"  naming  them.  I  then 
wrote  to  each  one  of  these  asking  for  the  name  of  the  father  of 
Gideon  Beardslej',  1113'  great-grandfather,  after  whom  ni}^  father 
was  named. 

The    invariable  repl3'   was,   "I  never  heard  of  such   a   man." 

Karly  in  188.3  I  decided  to  print  some  inquires  on  100  postal 
cards  for  distribution,  to  save  so  much  writing-,  never  dreaming 
that  T  would  find  enough  Beardsleys  to  require  that  number; 
but  to  m3-  surprise  these  lasted  but  a  short  time.  Then  followed 
another  hundred  of  postal  cards;  3'et  I  had  not  found  the  name 
of  m3'  great-great-grandfather. 

The  New  Fairfield,  Connecticut,  town  records,  whence  my 
grandparents  came,  had  been  burned,  with  the  town-house,  sotne 
3-ears  before  m3'  inquiries  began. 


6  GENEALOGICAL   HISTORY. 

Fortunatel)',  "Belah  Rogers,"  of  that  town,  had  copied  the 
Beardsle}'  items  for  one  J.  B.  Newcoaib,  of  Elgin,  III.,  whose 
grandmother  was  a  Beardsle}^ 

The  unused  portion  had  been  thrown  into  a  private  drawer. 
A  search  therein  revealed  the  secret  ;  but  I  had  gone  so  far  and 
gathered  so  much  it  was  thought  best  to  continue  \\\y  researches. 

A  short  circular,  three  or  four  hundred  in  number,  was  then 
issued.  These  lasted  but  a  short  time.  Others  followed  from 
time  to  time,  and  still  I  kept  hearing  of  Beardsleys  here  and 
there  all  over  this  country  and  in  Canada. 

Then  500  circulars  were  issued  with  blanks  to  fill  out  by  those 
of  the  family  name.     M3'  last  circular  of  1,500  said  : 

"Towns  and  parks  have  been  named  in  their  honor. 
As  builders  and  merchants  the}^  have  illuined  the  marts 
of  trade.  In  the  fields  of  science  and  medicine  thej'  have 
obtained  great  prominence.  In  the  arena  of  statesman- 
ship they  have  produced  men  of  thought  and  men  of  ac- 
tion. At  the  bar  and  in  the  administration  of  justice  they 
have  shown  erudition  and  wisdom.  As  clergymen,  edu- 
cators and  lecturers  they  have  occupied  high  places.  As 
authors  they  are  worthy  to  be  crowned  with  a  laurel 
wreath  of  fame.  As  heroes  of  Colonial,  Revolutionar}^ 
and  recent  wars  thej'  have  rendered  patriotic  service." 

There  have  been  not  a  few  difficulties  attending  the  prosecu- 
tion of  this  work.  The  main  one  has  been  the  indifference,  or  re- 
luctance to  communicate  what  was  known.  Of  course  each  one 
had  a  good  excuse,  having  never  heard  of  me  and  knew  not  m}^ 
motive. 

One  took  it  to  be  "an  advertising  scheme."  Another  was  so 
busy  that  he  deferred  his  repl}^  to  "a  more  convenient  season," 
which,  as  a  rule,  never  came.  Often  after  the  father's  death  my 
appeal  was  found  and  answered  \)y  some  j'ounger  member  of  the 
family. 

Many  thought  the}'  knew  so  little  of  the  family  history  it  was 
not  worth  communicating-.  One  maiden  lad}'  wrote:  "I  do  not 
think  the  Beardsle3'8   are  worth  looking   after,   or    writing    up." 


PR  EL  UDE.  7 

Others  thought,  "A  man  living-  so  far  out  in  the  'wool}^  west'  was 
not  in  position  to  gather  information  for  such  a  work." 

It  is  no  fault  of  the  author  if  some  families  are  treated  briefly, 
for  such  furnished  but  little  information. 

In  a  few  cases  the  penmanship  was  difficult  to  decipher, 
which  may  account  for  occasional  errors,  though  constant  effort 
was  made  to  verify,  from  other  sources,  all  information  given. 

Ofttimes  persons  would  answer,  signing  initials  onl}',  which 
caused  delaj'  and  unnecessar3^  correspondence.  These  are  but 
few  of  the  many  discouragements  met  with  as  the  history  has 
been  developed. 

Upon  the  whole  the  family  has  responded  nobl3%  and  it  has 
afforded  the  author  great  pleasure  to  have  the  acquaintance  of 
so  inany  superior  men  and  women  of  his  own  family  name. 

Then,  whenever  and  wherever  he  has  met  an3'  of  the  name 
the}^  have  treated  him  so  kindl}'  and  cordially  that  he  could  not 
but  feel  it  an  honor  to  belong  to  such  a  famil}'. 

My  partially  self-imposed  task  is  complete,  so  far  as  the  data 
at  hand  will  permit. 

My  only  regret  is  that  some  abler  hand  had  not  undertaken 
this,  and  not  onl3'  saved  me  from  man3^  years  of  hard  work,  but 
have  furnished  a  more  readable  }iistor3'  of  what  has  proven  to  be 
a  large  and  influential  family. 

However,  I  have  this  satisfaction  :  I  have  done  m3-  best,  spar- 
ing- neither  time,  strength,  or  expense  to  gather  all  possible  in- 
formation from  all  sources  and  in  any  localit3'  where  one  of  the 
name  has  been  found,  or  has  lived.  Twice  have  I  gone  over 
much  of  the  State  of  Connecticut  (formeri3'^  the  famil3'  home) 
searching  and  cop3'ing  Probate  lecords,  Church  records,  Bible 
records,  the  inscriptions  of  the  cemeteries,  confirming  these  with 
statements  of  the  aged  who  were  able  to  recall  man3^  facts  re- 
garding the  deceased.  I  have  also  visited  other  States,  and  Eng- 
land, whence  our  ancestor  came. 

In  addition,  I  have  enjplo3'ed  others  to  search  records  that  I 
could  not  reach. 


8  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

During  the  time  these  researches  have  been  in  progress,  for 
several  3'ears  I  had  in  addition  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of 
my  profession  upon  me,  which  absorbed  much  of  my  time  and 
attention.  This  added  to  the  difficulties  connected  with  the  pro- 
secution of  such  a  study  and  work. 

It  may  not  be  out  of  place  to  add,  several  times  since  these 
gatherings  began  the  author  has  been  near  the  eternal  crossing, 
but  through  the  kind  Providence  of  God  he  has  been  spared  to 
complete  this  work. 

Added  to  all  this,  I  have  written  within  that  period,  and  pub- 
lished, two  other  books,  one  of  188  and  the  other  of  605  pages,  of 
which  I  had  not  the  slightest  conception  when  I  began  this  in- 
vestigation. 

Finall}^  the  long  study  of  the  genealogical  histor}'  of  the 
family  has  begotten  in  me  a  love  and  respect  for  the  naine  of 
"Beardsle} '■  unknown  before. 

The  result  of  twenty  years  research,  as  heretofore  outlined,  is 
before  j'ou. 

A  thorough  perusal  of  this  work  will  reveal  that  thej'  have 
been  activelj'  and  intimately  associated  with  the  civil,  ecclesias- 
tical, industrial  and  commercial  affairs  of  America;  and  to  be- 
come conversant  with  their  history  w^ill  naturall}'  create  in  5'our 
children  a  source  of  pride  in  the  name  heretofore  unappreciated. 

I  hope  all  who  read  this  book  will  take  to  heart  its  teachings  ; 
will  strive  earnestly  to  emulate  the  virtues  of  the  fathers  and  to 
shun  their  vices. 

God  bless  30U  each  !  God  bless  each  and  all  in  whose  veins 
Beardsley  blood  flows !  God  bless  those  who  thoughtfull}^  per- 
use these  pages,  is  the  earnest  pra3'er  of  the  compiler.  Fare- 
well!

ORIGIN  OF  THE  NAME. 

Edwin  Salter,  of  Washington,  1).  C,  published  an  article  in 
the  Daily  Sun,  of  St.  John,  N.  B.,  in  1884,  on  the  •'Beardsleys,"  in 
which  he  gave  the  origin  of  the  name  : 

"In  a  work  on  Kngliah  surnames  by  Charles  Wareing 
Bardslej',  published  in  London,  1875,  Robert  de  Bardesle 
on  Hundred  Rolls,  and  Wm.  de  Bardesley,  rolls  of  Parlia- 
ment are  mentioned.  In  Burke's  arms  and  crests  of  famil- 
ies of  Great  Britain  mention  is  made  of  the  Lancashire

Bardse}-,  and  the  crest  given  is  :  'Ar.  two  bars  gu.  on  a 
canton  of  the  second  a  maunch  of  the  first.' 

"The  same  work  sa5's  that  the  last  heir  of  the  Bardseys 
of  Furness  in  Lancashire,  was  Nicholas  Bardsey  who  died 
tempo  Charles  the  First,  leaving  two  daughters,  Doroth}', 
who  married  Anderton  of  Claj'ton,  and  Elizabeth,  who 
married  Lancelot  Salkfield  of  Whitehall.  Crest  :  'Ar.  two

heraldrj',  signifies  a  ]ad3''s  sleeve,  and  is  found  in  the  arms 
or  crests  of  several  noble  families,  and  seems  to  indicate 
the  best  trait  of  chivalr}- — that  he  to  whom  it  belonged 
was  a  'defender  of  the  defenceless.' 

"In  Wests'  Histor}'  of  Furness  it  is  said  that  in  the  bar- 
on}' of  Kendal  (Lancashire  and  Westmoreland)  a  descend- 
ant of  Ivo  De  Tailbor's  assumed  the  surname  of  Bardsea. 
As  Bardsea  is  a  noted  island  on  the  coast  of  Wales,  said 
to  have  been  a  refuge  of  the  Welsh  bards,  it  is  probable 
that  Baron  De  Tailbor's  son  or  decendant  was  owner  or 
lord  of  the  island.  The  ancient  name  of  Robert  de  Bard- 
esle, above  mentioned,  suggests  the  possibilit}'  of  its 
meaning  Robert  of  Bards  Isle.  According  to  West's  His- 
tor}'  of  Furness  in  Lancashire,  Bardsea  was  adopted  as  a 
surname  about  the  jear  1211,  and  from  that  date  coming 
on  down,  we  find  the  orthograph}'  changing  to  Bardsej', 
Bardes}',  Bardesle}',  Bardsley  and  Berdsley.  The  last 
mentioned,  with  a  long  sound  on  the  first  'e'  (as  in  mete)

gives    the    American    pronounciation     of    Beardsley    or 
Beardslea. 

'■The  origin  of  the  name  can  thus  be  traced  through 
slight  variations  in  orthography,  away  back  to  a  descend- 
ant of  one  of  William  the  First's  chiefs,  who  was  owner  or 
lord  of  Bardsea,  the  island  of  the  Welsh  bards." 

"Bardsey  {i  e.  Bards'  Island)  stands  at  the  northern  extremity 
of  Cardigan  Ba^',  and  is  two  and  one-half  miles  long  and  one 
mile  broad.  It  includes  about  370  acres  in  its  area,  one-third  of 
which  is  hill3\  There  is  a  good  harbor  on  the  south-east  side, 
where  vessels  of  forty  tons  nia}^  enter." 

Edmondson's  "Heraldrj'''  carries  the  name  back  past  the 
Middle  Ages,  showing  that  the  same  name  existed  in  two  differ- 
ent counties,  but  evidently  of  one  family,  as  the  coat  of  arms  was 
nearly  the  same. 

The  village  of  Bardsley,  near  Manchester,  England,  is  very 
old,  and  according  to  Rev.  C.  W.  Bardsley,  of  Manchester,  "was  a 
grant  for  some  sort  of  service,  for  which  a  rental  was  paid  of  a 
penny  and  a  rose  3'earl3^"  Edwin  Salter  further  saj's,  "ley,"  "lee," 
"leigh,"  are  ancient  terminations  of  English  names.  The}'  all 
have  the  same  meaning,  in  fact  they  are  only  different  methods 
of  spelling  the  same  word.  They  inean  pasture  land,  field,  com- 
mons, cultivated  lands.     The  Welsh  "Lie"'  means  "place." 

Not  far  from  Stratford-on-Avon  was  an  ancient  monastry  of 
which  it  is  said,  "Guy  Beauchamp  bestowed  benefactions  upon 
the  monks  of  Bardsle3^" 

One  member  of  the  family  wrote  me  from  Brookl3'n,  N.  Y., 
that  there  was  a  man  somewhere,  waj^  back,  whose  name  was 
"Beard,"  who  had  a  son  by  the  name  of  "Lee."'  His  descendants 
were  called  Beardslees  to  distinguish  them  from  the  other  mem- 
bers of  the  famil}'.    Thus,  he  thought,  the  name  originated  (?) 

Edwin  Salter,  of  Washington,  D.  C,  from  whom  important 
quotations  have  already  been  made,  writes:  "You  have  in  the 
Beardsley  family  many  honorable  names,  and  as  a  family  it  is 
above  the  average  in  ability  and  respectability." 


ORIGIN  OF   THE   NAME. 

Hinman,  a  historian  of  Connecticut,  also  says : 

"This  has  been  a  respected  family  from  the  first  settle- 
ment of  Stratford.  Cyrus  Hall  Beardsley,  former!}^  Judge 
of  the  Count}'  Court,  Speaker  of  the  Connecticut  House  of 
Representatives,  etc.,  was  a  descendant.  Twelve  of  the 
family  had  graduated  at  'Yale'  prior  to  1845.''

V. 
THE  SPELLING  OF  THE  NAME. 

Spelling  in  those  early  times  was  not  reduced  to  a  science.  It 
was  largely  phonetic;  hence  one  or  more  different  letters  were 
used  in  a  given  word  in  the  same  document  and  by  the  same 
penman. 

In  the  old  Probate  records  in  Connecticut  I  found  the  name 
spelled  quite  differently  in  the  same  paper;  for  instance,  Beards- 
le3',  Beardslee,  Bardsl}',  Berslej^,  etc. 

There  are  those  who  insist  that  the  name  should  end  with 
"i?^"  instead  of  'Vj."  Tradition  in  one  familj'  has  the  origin  of  the 
"ee"  ending  this  wa}'.  "The  spelling  of  the  'ee'  instead  of  'ey' 
came  from  the  fact  that  in  1760  one  Thomas  Beardsley  was  com- 
missioned, by  the  British  Crown,  as  a  Colonel,  or  Justice  of  the 
Peace.  When  that  commission  arrived  the  name  was  spelled 
Beardslee  ;  so  he  was  obliged  to  spell  his  name  that  way,  or  lose 
his  commission."  I  cannot  vouch  for  the  truthfulness  of  this 
stateinent. 

The  records  of  the  ship  "Planter,"  in  which  the  first  of  the 
name  came  to  this  country,  so  far  as  we  have  any  record,  have 
the  names  of  the  parents  spelled  "Beardsley"  and  of  the  children 
"Beardslie,"  which  is  the  French  way  of  spelling  "ley  "  Mary, 
the  mother's  name,  was  spelled  Marie,  which  meant  Mary.  Har- 
vy  was  spelled  Harvie  in  the  same  record. 

In  the  list  of  "Loyalists,"  to  whom  lots  were  granted  in  St. 
John,  New  Brunswick,  1783,  are  found  the  names  of  John  Beards- 
ley (the  chaplain),  who  was  granted  lot  151,  and  Paul  Beardsle}', 
granted  lot  374. 

Notice  the  following  spelling  of  the  name  as  given  by  one 
authority  : 

"The  spelling  of  the  name  is  various  in  historical  and 
genealogical  works.  In  Savage's  Genealogical  Dictionary' 
and  other  American  works  it  is  given  as  Beardsley,  Beards- 
lee, Bearsley,  Bersley,  and  Berdsley." 


THE  SPELLING    OF   THE  NAME.  13 

In  England  the  name  is  now  spelled  in  one  of  two  ways, 
Beardsle}^  or  Bardsley,  dropping  the  first  "e"  in  the  last  case. 

In  March,  1873,  when  in  Damascus,  Syria,  the  author  met  three 
clergymen  of  the  Church  of  England,  wlio  bore  the  name  of 
Bardslej', — two  brothers  and  the  son  of  another  brother.  They 
said  their  father  was  a  clergyman  in  Yorkshire.  He  had  seven 
sons,  all  of  whom  were  clerg3'men,  and  four  grandsons  were  also 
clergjMiien,  which  made  twelve  of  that  family  who  were  clergy- 
men in  the  Church  of  England. 

On  March  30, 1873,  at  3  P.  M.,  one  of  thetn  preached  a  dedicatory 
sermon  (text,  Acts  xiii.  38,  39)  in  Dainastus.  The  next  Sabbath, 
April  6,  the  other  brother.  Rev.  J.  W.  Bardsle}',  preached  in  Bey- 
rout  (text,  I.  Peter  iv.  8).  Thej^  certainly  were  "workmen  that 
needeth  not  to  be  ashamed.''  Both  sermons  were  on  the  revival 
line.  They  were  earnest  Christian  ministers,  an  honor  to  the 
name.  The  last-tnentioned  has  since  become  Bishop  of  Carlisle, 
one  of  the  most  important  positions  in  the  Church  of  England, 

When  introduced  to  them,  after  a  little  conversation  with  the 
writer,  one  said  :  "You  are  not  a  Beardslej',  j^ou  are  a  genuine 
Bardsley.  Your  look  and  your  voice  is  like  ours."  Their  compli- 
mentary^ words  were  greatly  appreciated. 

In  my  personal  searching  (1891)  in  the  "Heraldry"  Office  in 
London,  England,  I  found  the  name  always  ended  with  "ly"  or 
"lej^,"  and  never  with  "ee." 

The  coat  of  arms,  consisting  of  a  shield  with  a  brass  head  in 
the  center  thereof  and  a  bear  proper  at  the  top,  was  not  adopted 
until  1749,  b}^  one  Peter  Beardsley. 

Then  there  was  a  family  of  Bardsleys  in  Lancaster  with  a 
coat  of  arms  consisting  of  a  lady's  flowing  sleeve  at  the  upper 
left  hand  corner,  as  3'ou  face  it,  without  the  bear's  head. 

There  was  another  fainil3^  of  Bardsle3S  in  Surrey  County,  who 
had  a  coat  of  arms  with  three  bears  heads  in  the  form  of  a  tri- 
angle, two  ot  the  top  and  one  below. 

These   three   designs   are   all  the   College  of   Arms,  London,

shows.     This  information  cost  me  $2.50.     The  clerk  made  a  copy 
of  each  for  me. 

Rev.  W.  O.  Raymond,  an  Episcopal  clerjrj'man  of  St.  John, 
N.  B.,  a  grandson  of  Chaplain  John  Beardsley,  writes  me :  "The 
niuster-rolls  of  the  regiment  are  in  iny  possession,  and  I  find  the 
chaplain's  name  spelled  very  variously, — Beardsle}',  Basley, 
Baesley,  Baisley,  Bardsley  and  Bardly." 

1  have  in  my  possession  a  letter  written  by  the  Chaplain,  and 
he  signs  his  name  "Beardsiey." 

William,  the  first  emigrant  (1635)  signs  his  name  "Beardsley" 
to  his  will,  and  in  other  documents  of  his  time  I  find  the  same 
methods  used.  From  all  this  evidence,  I  can  arrive  at  no  other 
conclusion  than  that  the  naixie  should  always  be  spelled 
"Beardsley." 

In  Rev.  John  Wesley's  Works  (Vol.  vii.  p.  128-131)  we  find  three 
letters,  dated  1772, 1775,  1779.  to  one  Rev.  Samuel  Beardsley,  copies 
of  which  ma3'  be  found  under  the  name  of  Philander  E.  Beards- 
ley, where  is  also  the  record  of  an  old  Bible.  In  it  is  the  name 
of  Beardslej'  plainly  written.  Note  how  the  name  was  then 
spelled. 

Once  more.  In  my  searchings  at  St.  Alban's,  England,  from 
which  "  Williajn"  brought  letters  of  recommendation,  I  found  the 
marriage  of  one  "Thomas  Berdslej'  and  Jane  Upton,  Jul}'  16, 
1581."  (See  Appendix.)  Their  names  and  those  of  their  eight 
children  were  all  spelled  Berdsley,  leaving  out  the  "a."  It  may 
be  of  iftterest  also  to  know  that  one  "H.  W.  Beardsley,"  of  West 
Brompton,  Eng.,  wishes  the  championship  of  the  world  as  a 
pigeon  shootist.  This  great  matter  (to  him)  can  be  decided  in 
either  Chicago,  New  York  or  Boston. 

All  have  seen  notices  of  one  Aubry  Beardsley,  of  England, 
who  was  a  celebrated  sketch  painter.  Alas  !  his  career  ended  too 
soon.  He  was  considered  by  many  artists  a  man  of  great  prom- 
ise to  the  world. 

By  these  references  all  can  see  how  the  name  is  spelled  in  the 
mother  country. 


THE  SPELLING    OF   THE  NAME. 


15 


There  is  a  town  in  Minnesota,  near  the  line  of  Dakota,  by  the 
name  of  "Beardsley  ;"  another  in  northwest  Kansas  has  the  same 
name.  A  laroe  park  in  Brido^eport,  Conn.,  also  has  the  name  of 
"Beardsley."

VI. 

THE  BEARDSLEY-LEE  FAMILY  IN 

AMERICA.  -' 

As  to  the  origin  of  the  Beardsley-"/i?^"  family  in  America, 
there  are  many  dififerent  tradjtions  extant.  Some  contend  that  it 
had  a  Welsh  origin.  One  old  lady  wrote  me  :  "I  am  no  relation 
of  5'ours.  My  famil}^  came  from  the  west  coast  of  Wales."  Other 
families  have  the  same  tradition. 

Others  say  :  "There  were  three  brothers  who  came  from  Eng- 
land, before  the  Revolutionary  War,  about  1700,  and  settled  in 
New  Jersey,  since  which  their  descendants  have  scattered  through 
the  United  States." 

Another  writes  :  "We  have  a  tradition  that  our  ancestors  were 
descendants  of  a  French  Huguenot  who  fled  from  France  to  Eng- 
land, about  eighty  3^ears  before  the  settlement  in  Stratford"  (1558- 
1638), 

I  have  inet  and  also  heard  froin  others  who  affirm  that  "My 

ancestors  came  direct  from  England  some  time  in  the  past,  but 

we  do  not  know  when." 

In  all  these  "traditions"  I  discover  several  evident  facts, 
namely  : 

(1)  That  the  family  has  an  English  origin. 

(2)  That  the  Welsh  tradition  (found  in  man}'  families)  comes 
from  the  family  history  in  the  Island  of  Bardsey. 

(3)  The  French  Huguenot  theory  comes  from  family  associa- 
tions had  with  the  Chief — General — of  William  the  Conqueror. 

(4)  Lastl}',  the /'/^r&lt;?i?  ^r(7/&gt;^^r.y  were  the  three  sons  of  "William," 
from  whom  the  Ainerican  family  has  descended. 

I  have  acted  upon  the  theorj^  that  unless  a  family  was  able  to 
show  some  other  time  and  date  of  their  ancestor's  coming-,  that 
they  were  the  descendants  of  one  of  William's  sons,  no  matter 
what  the  "traditions"  might  be  (see  Appendix)  ;  hence  what  fol- 
lows : 


THE  BEARDSLEY-LEE  FAMILY  IN  AMERICA.  17 

William  Beakdsley,  the  progenitor  of  the  family  in  Ameri- 
ca, was  born  in  England  in  1605.  (Hatton's  List  of  Emigrants  to 
America  1600-1700.) 

Most  careful  and  persistent  searchings  in  Stratford-on-Avon, 
a  traditional  home  of  William,  made  by  the  author,  failed  to  re- 
veal one  particle  of  evidence  that  a  Beardsley  had  ever  resided 
in  that  town.  The  old  church  records  were  thoroughl3'  examined, 
for  the  privilege  of  which  he  had  to  pay  two  shillings.  The 
gravej'ard  was  also  most  carefully  searched  with  no  better  re- 
sults. 

I  had  hoped  the  "tradition"  to  that  effect  might  be  substanti- 
ated b}'  some  record  of  his  birtli,  his  marriage,  or  the  baptism  of 
his  children  ;  but  nothing  of  the  kind  could  be  found. 

The  probabilities  are  that  his  last  residence,  or  that  of  his 
ancestors,  was  St.  Alban's,  Hertfordshire,  for  he  took  "A  certifi- 
cate from  the  minister  there  and  attestations  from  the  Justice  of 
the  Peace  to  I^ondon,  according  to  the  Lord's  order,"  from  which 
place  the}'  sailed  in  the  ship  "Planter,"  Captain  Travice  com- 
manding (note  the  queer  spelling),  "2  Aprilis  1635.  Theis  under 
written  names  to  be  transported  to  New  England."  (Ship's 
record.) 

There  were  thirty-seven  emigrants  in  all.  Nineteen  were  over 
21  years  of  age  and  eighteen  under  21.  Two  were  20  and  one  6 
inonths. 

The  name,  age  and  occupation  of  each  is  given.  There  were 
six  Tuttells,  three  Lawrences,  one  Antrobus,  age  65,  one  Green, 
one  Weast,  one  Heford,  ohe  Chittwood,  four  01ne3's,  one  Giddins, 
one  Savage,  two  Harris,  one  Peabody,  three  Wilcoxsons,  five 
Beardslej'S,  one  Perle},  one  Felloe,  one  Baker,  one  Carter,  one 
Williamson,  and  one  Morrison. 

Their  occupations  were  quite  varied.  There  was  one  "mer- 
cer,'' three  "shoemakers,''  three  "tailors,"'  three  "husbandmen," 
one  "weaver,"  and  one  "7nason." 

It  is  with  the  latter  that  we  have  to  do.     The  following  is  a 


18  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

verbatim  copy  of  the  ship's  record  of  our  faniilj^  (Hatton's  List  of 
Emigrants)  : 

"A  Mason,  William  Beardsle3%  j'ears  30. 
Marie  Beardsley,  "       26. 

Marie  Beardslie,  "         4. 

John  Beardslie,  "        2. 

Joseph  Beardslie,  "        6  mo.'' 

The  ending-  of  the  words  "z&gt;"  is  the  Anglo-French  way  of 
spelling  "ej^''  or  "}' ;"  instance,  Marie  meant  "Mary,"  Beardslie 
meant  Beardsl}^  or  "ley." 

These  emigrants  landed  in  Massachusetts,  probably,  about 
the  first  of  June,  or  later  in  the  summer  of  1635. 

William  Beardsley  took  the  oath  Dec.  7, 1636,  and  was  admitted 
a  freeman  of  Massachusetts  1638  ;  hence  he  must  have  been  a 
landholder.  (Winthrop's  History  of  New  England.)  Where  did 
he  then  reside?  I  think  it  highly  probable  he  was  then  living  in 
Watertown,  eight  miles  west  of  Boston.  It  is  known  that  several 
of  his  ship  associates  resided  at  this  place.  Dr.  Trumbull  says  : 
"In  1635  the  Watertown  people  gradually  removed  and  prosecuted 
their  settlement  at  Wethersfield,  Conn."  A  few  had  gone  there 
the  3'ear  previous,  and  that  3'ear  some  of  them  located  at  Hart- 
ford. 

Of  the  early  settlers  of  Stratford,  five  families  were  from  Con- 
cord, Mass.  Two  of  these,  the  Wilcoxsons  and  Harrises,  were 
with  William  Beardsley  on  the  good  ship  "Planter,"  and  were 
made  freemen  of  Massachusetts  at  the  same  time. 

It  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that,  when  these  colonists  reached 
the  Connecticut  River  (the  Indian  name  of  this  stream  was 
Quoncktacut,  "River  of  Pines."— H3^de's  Indian  Wars,  p.  37),  at 
Hartford  and  Wethersfield,  the}'  met  William,  when  he  joined 
them  and  proceeded  with  them  to  found  a  new  town  where  thej' 
could  better  their  financial  condition. 

Another  reason  for  this  conviction  is,  Mar}^  William's  eldest 
daughter,  married  Thomas  Welles,  in  Hartford,  Ma}',  1651,  and 
was  a  resident  of  Wethersfield  for  nine  years.     I  think  their  ac- 


THE  BE  A  RDSL  E  Y-LEE  FA  MIL  Y  IN  A  M  ERIC  A .  19 

quaintaiice  began  previous  to  1G39,  when  her  parents  resided  in 
one  ot  the  towns  named;  for  Hugh  Welles,  his  father,  was  a  resi- 
dent of  that  localitj'. 

William  Beardsle}'  and  seventeen  others  left  Hartford  and 
Wethersfield  (onl}^  six  miles  apart)  in  a  body  (probably  by  boat), 
and  settled  on  a  piece  of  cleared  land  on  Long-  Island  Sound, 
October  3,  1639.  This  place  the  General  Court  in  Hartford,  Oct. 
10,  1639.  called  "Pigiianockey  In  June,,  1640,  the  same  court  called  it 
"Citpheay"  (the  Indian  name),  and  in  lGi3  "Stratford,''  by  which 
name  that  locality  has  been  known  to  this  day. 

It  is  claitned  on  very  good  authority  that  William  Beardslej^ 
named  the  town  of  Stratford,  Conn.  This,  I  think,  is  indisput- 
able. 

Hinman  says  :  "William  Beardsley  was  deput3^  of  the  Gen- 
eral Court  at  Hartford  for  eight  sessions  between  1645  and  1661  " 

This  court  was  the  same  as  our  Legislature  of  the  present 
day,  and  held  its  sessions  twice  a  year. 

The  Colonial  Records  say  that  William  Beardsle}'  was  elected 
to  the  court  sessions  in  1615,  May,  1650,  September,  1650,  October 
1651,  May.  1652,  October,  1653,  February.  1656.  and  May,  1658. 

He  served  eight  terms  in  thirteen  j^ears,  showing  that  he  was 
a  man  of  some  worth  and  influence. 

In  the  old  colonial  documents  he  is  often  spoken  of  as  the 
"  Goodman  Beardsley.'' 

He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  First  Congregational 
Church  of  Stratford,  and  was  a  leading-  spirit  in  all  public  affairs 
of  those  early  times,  as  all  the  records  clearly  show. 

In  1649  the  Court  made  the  following  appointment  by  vote  : 
"Mr.  Ludlow  was  desired  to  take  care  for   preparing 

the  soulgers  with  provisions  and  all  necessar3res  for  the 

designe  in   the  two  (sea-side)  Towns  ;  and  Mr    Hull    and    . 

William  Beardsley  are  chosen  to  assist  therein  " 

Then  again,  at  the  October  session,  1651  : 

"Andrew  Warde,  George  Hull  and  William  Beardsle}^ 

are  propounded  for  Assistants  to  join  with  the  Magistrates 

for  the  execution  of  justice  in  the  Towns  bj^  the  sea-side.'' 


20  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

This  meant  Stratford  and  Fairfield.  From  all  this  it  is  evi-

ship  "Planter,"  and  with  them  to  where  Stratford,  Conn.,  now  is, 
in  1639.     He  d.  Nov.  19,  1718,  aged  85,  and  his  wife  d.  Dec.  3,  1718. 

He  was  made  Lieutenant  in  1697.  and  Captain  in  Maj^,  1704,  "of 
the  training  band  of  soldiers." 

He  took  the  oath  of  a  freeman  June  4,  1712.  He  was  at  one 
time  a  slave  owner.  His  slaves  were  liberated  bj-  the  following 
instrument : 

"Be  it  known  xinto  all  men  \iy  these  presents  that  1, 
John  Beardsley,  in  the  connty  of  Fairfield,  farmer,  have 
remised,  released,  acqtiitted,  and  by  these  presents  do,  for 
me,  my  heirs  or  assigns,  have  freelj'  and  full}'  given  mj- 
Negro  man  his  time  and  freedom  at  inj-  decease,  and  have 
given  him  a  dowr}^  of  \ny  estate  if  he  doth  stand  in  need 
hereof,  and  have  given  him  \\\y  horse  that  was  called  my 
wife's  horse  :  as  witness  \\\y  hand  the  25th  da}"  of  Decem- 
ber, 1717. 

(Signed)        John  Beardsle}^,  his  mark." 

He  for  man}'  5'ears  resided  "at  the  south  end  of  Stratford  vil- 
lage, btit  in  1668  he  had  a  house  at  Piquannock  (now  on  Park 
Avenue,  a  little  north  of  Fairfield  Avenue,  in  Bridgeport),  where 
he  was  among-  the  earliest  settlers." 

His  will  was  dated  Jan.  1,  1714-15,  and  proved  Nov.  25,  1718,  and 
the  inventory  of  his  estate  was  dated  Dec.  3,  1718.  In  his  will  he 
says  :  "I,  John  Beardslej',  Sen.,  give  m}'  propert}-  to  sundr}'  kins- 
men and  kinswomen  :  to  mj'  kinswoman,  Deborah  Fairchild,  wife 
of  Alexander  Fairchild ;"  and  he  had  given  her,  in  1704,  five 
acres  of  land,  south  of  Golden  Hill.  (Histor}'  of  Stratford,  1130) — 
Land  South  of  Indian's  land,  also  the  hassakej'  meadow  Ij'ing-  be- 
low^  and  above  the  spring'  next  the  highwaj'.  Leaving  wife,  Han- 
nah Beardslej',  buildings  in  Stratfield"  (now  Bridgeport). 

His  estate  west  of  Piqtiannock  River  he  divided  thus  :  One- 
third  to  his  wife's  heirs,  one-third  to  John,  "son  to  m}-  brother 
Daniel,  and  one-third  to  John  Fairchild,  son  to  Alexander  Fair- 
child." 

It  is  thought  bj'  some  that  "Deborali"  was  the  dau.  of  his 
uncle,  Thomas  Beardsle}',  of  Fairfield,  who  d.  in  1656,  leaving  sev-

er:il  cliildren,  and  that  she  was  brought  up  by  Capt.  Jolin,  lier 
uncle  (.see  Appendix),  and  hence  the  reason  for  giving  her  and 
lier  son  so  much  of  his  estate.  In  the  town  records  of  Stratford 
(Book  2  p.  44)  may  be  found.  "Sarah,  dau.  b.  May  9.  1678."  If  she 
was  the  dau.  of  John  slie  i)robahly  d.  y.,  for  he  left  no  bving  eliil-

Note — In  all  these  documents  the  name  is  spelled  as  here 
given,  Beardsley,  and  not  once  with  "ee."  That  form  of  spelling 
comes  in  in  after  generations. 


Joseph  Beardsley-  (William'),  b.  Nov.  — ,  1()34,  in  England, 
and  l)rought,  when  six  months  old,  to  New  England.  When  a  boy 
about  five  years  old  the  familj-  settled  in  Cupheag,  1639;  after- 
wards, in  164H,  named,  and  known  as  Stratford,  Conn. 

Here,  on  the  banks  of  "the  Housatonic  River,  about  one  and 
one-half  miles  from  Long  Island  Soiind,  in  Fairfield  Cotxnty,  Con- 
necticut, which  was  fourteen  miles  from  New  Haven  and  fiftj^- 
eight  miles  from  New  York  City,"  he  grew  to  man's  estate,  and 
became  ver}'  fond  of  the  water. 

This  his  much  esteemed  and  honored  father  did  not  like  ;  for 
when  he  made  his  will,  September  28,  1660,  he  left  him  qtxite  a 
property  on  the  condition  that  he  "married  and  left  the  sea." 

This  he  did  not  fail  do  do.  An  old  record  shows  that  he  re- 
sided at  Brookhaven,  Long  Island,  Aug.  1,  16(jl. 

In  KK),")  he  m.  Abigail  Dayton,  of  Long  Island.  He  took  the 
oath  of  a  freeman  June  -1,  16(38. 

He  joined  the  Congregational  Clmrch  in  Sti'atford  in  1693, 
where  he  d.  May  29,  1712,  aged  78. 

The  inventory  of  his  estate  amounted  to  £782  7s.  6d.  From  the 
distribution  it  seems  that  he  owned  "land  in  the  old  field,  great 
neck.  Walnut  tree  hill,  and  at  traj)  fall  hill." 

His  sons  Joseph  and  John  were  appointed  administrators  b}-

Charter  Members  of  the  First  Congregational  Church  of  Stratfield

I  give  that  red  cow  which  I  have  now  lent  him." 

Sept.  21,  1663,  he  bought  land  of  Kdward  Higbee.  "He  also  re-

THE  OLi:)EN  TIME. 

It  ir*  cinite  clifticult  for  us,  in  the  rush  of  this  age,  to  conceive 
of  the  habits  and  customs  of  our  forefathers,  seventj^-five  and  two 
l\undred  j'ears  ago.  The  following-  statements,  bj-  Dr.  George 
Bushnell,  of  Hartford,  will  g-ive  some  idea  of  some  of  these  : 

"The  seats  of  the  school-house  were  made  of  slabs  from 
the  saw-mill  (the  aiithor  well  remembers  when  he  was 
favored  (?)  with  seats  of  similar  stjle  in  the  State  of  New 
York),  supported  bj-  slant  legs  driven  into  and  a  proper 
distance  through  augur  holes,  and  planed  smooth  on  the 
top  bj'  the  rather  tardy  process  of  friction." 

"The  meeting-  house  probably  stood  on  some  hill,  mid- 
wa}-  between  three  or  four  vallej^s,  whither  the  tribes  go 
up  to  worship,  and  where  the  snow-drifts  are  deepest.  Go 
literall}'  from  strength  to  strength." 

"There  is  no  furnace  or  stove,  save  the  foot-stoves  that 
are  tilled  from  the  tires  of  the  neighboring-  houses,  and 
brought  in  partly  as  a  rather  formal  compliment  to  the 
delicac}-  of  the  tender  sex,  and  sometimes  because  thej- 
were  really  wanted."  (I  can  well  remember  when  the  above 
custom  prevailed  in  other  parts,  though  I  was  quite  small. 
&gt;I.  L.  Beardsle3^,  of  Los  Angeles,  California,  ha-\  one  of 
those  convenient  meeting-house  stoves.  Call  and  he  will 
be  glad  to  show  it  to  30U.) 

"The  dress  of  the  assembl}-  was  mostly-  homespun,  in- 
dicating- onl}-  slight  distinctions  of  qtialit}'  in  the  worship- 
ers. Thej'  are  seated  according  to  age  and  their  tax  lists. 
The  older  and  heaver  tax  payers  in  front  near  the  pulpit, 
surmounted  b}'  its  sounding  board,  a  wooden  canop\  ; 
the  jounger  generally  farther  back,  enclosed  in  pews,  sit- 
ting back  to  back,  impounded,  all  for  deep  thought  and 
spiritual  digestion  ;  only  the  Deacons  sitting." 

In  the  seatings  of  the  Presb3terian  meeting-house  in  New 
Milford,  Conn.,  in  1812,  Klisha  Beardsle}'  was  given  the  loitrtk  rank, 
tax  list,  $111,  and  Asher  Beardslj- equal  honor,  tax  list  $128;  hav-

ing'  pews  close  under  the  pulpit,  b}'  themselves,  where  thej'  could 
receive  "the  more  perpendicular  dropping-s  of  the  word." 

It  will  surprise  man}'  to  ktiow  that  churcli  pews  were  owned 
and  deeded  like  other  propertj-,  even  as  late  as  l!S2.i,  as  the  follow- 
uig-  partial  copj'  of  a  deed  of  that  date  will  confirm  : 

"Know  all  men  b}'  these  presents  that  I,  Horace  M. 
Shepard  of  Newton  in  the  count}'  of  Fairfield  and  state  of 
Connecticut,  for  the  consideration  of  one  dollar  received 
do  b}'  the  presents  remise,  release  and  forever  quit  claim 
unto  *  *  *  two-thirds  of  one  certain  pew  in  the  Presby- 
terian meeting"  house,,  so  called,  situate  on  the  south  side 
of  said  house,  being  the  fourth  pew  from  the  west  end  of 
said  house,  formerl}-  occupied  and  owned  b}^  iny  father, 
Timothj'  Shepherd,  P3sq.,  deceased." 

Strange  as  all  this  ma}'  appear, 

"These  are  they  who  bore  the  cross. 

Nobly  for  their  Master  stood  ; 
Sufferers  in  his  righteous  cause, 

Followers  of  the  dying'  God. 
Out  of  great  distress  they  came, 

\\  ashed  their  robes  by  faith  beh)w, 
In  the  ))lood  of  yonder  Lamb, 

Blood  that  washes  white  as  snow." 

Longfellow  quaintl}   writes  of  the  olden  time  : 

"Kach  man  cquipt,  on  Sunda}   morn, 
With  Fsalm-l)()ok,  shot  and  powder-horn." 

Tlius  they  went  to  church  ready  for  worship  or  battle.  A 
watchman  stood  without  during"  the  ser\ice  to  g"i^'e  the  alarm  in 
case  of  an  Indian  attack. 

"There  is  a  time,  we  know  not  when, 

A  place,  ^ve  know  not  where. 
Which  marks  tlie  destinies  of  men 

For  glory  or  despair." 

William   Cothren,  of   Woodl)ur\-,  Conn.,  pictures  tlie  customs 

of  the  olden  time  as  follows  : 

"John  Miner,  Jr.,  being  seriously  inclined,  b\-  tlie  state 
of  liis   aifections,  unto   tlu-   l)iooming  antl  couu'In damsel, 


THE   OLDEN    TL\TE.  29 

Siirali  Judson,  iiiouiiU-cl  liis  horse,  with  a  deer-skiti  for  a 
saddU'  and  rode  over  in  front  of  the  house  of  the  fair 
Sa rail's  fatlier.  Without  disnionntino'  sent  for  lier  to  come 
out  to  him,  and  on  lier  complyint;-  with  his  recjuest,  he  in- 
formed her  ])hiinly,  tliat  the  Lord  luid  sent  him  to  marry 
her.  At  this  startling-  announcement  the  sensible  maid, 
neither  faintiTio-  in  the  present  fashionable  niode,  nt)r  ask- 
ing- him  to  consult  her  mamma,  replied  with  a  hearty  gootl 
will  :  'Here  ?s  ihe  Jiaiiih}iaui  of  the  Lord  His  ivili  be  done.' 
What  else  could  the  maiden  do?  For  John  was  a  good 
man,  and  she  l)elieved  both  in  him  and  his  message. 
Tliere  was  nothing  more  to  do  than  to  get  on  horseback 
the  next  Sabbath  evening,  and  sitting-  on  a  piHion,  behind 
her  messenger  from  the  Lord,  ride  to  the  parsonage,  and 
l)e  duly  joined  in  the  lionds  of  holj-  wedlock." 


"Our  lives  are  all)ums,  written  through 
With  good  or  ill,  with  false  or  true  ; 
And  as  the  blessed  angels  turn 

The  pages  of  oiir  years  ; 
Ciod  grant  they  read  the  good  with  smiles 

And  blot  the  bad  with  tears."

Since  our  ancestors  figured  so  extensivelj'  in  and  about  Strut. 
ford,  it  will  not  be  out  of  place  to  make  a  few  historical  inser- 
tions : 

"Stratford  was  settled  under  the  auspices  of  the  Con- 
necticut Colon}^,  which  had,  on  January  14th,  1638,  adopted 
a  constitution,  which  has  become  the  pattern  of  'the  Con- 
stitution of  our  States,  and  of  the  Republic  itself,  as  thej' 
exist. to-daj^'  In  that  great  work  some  of  the  pioneers  of 
this  town  took  part,  and  share  in  its  credit,  for  some  of 
them  lived  in  Hartford  and  Whethersfield,  before  they 
came  to  Stratford  in  1039. 

"It  was  about  19  years  after  the  landing  of  the  Pilgrims 
at  Pljanouth.  For  some  3'ears  the  English  and  the  Dutch 
had  been  contending  for  Connecticut.  In  1(533  the  famous 
Holmes  sailed  up  the  Connecticut  river,  b}'  the  Dutch 
fort,  landing  at  Windsor,  where  he  biiilt  his  house  and 
fortified  it. 

"In  1(33.1  Hartford,  Wind-^or  and  Wethersfield  were 
founded  b}*  emigrants  from  the  Massachusetts  settle- 
ments, and  strange  enough,  the}'  came  here  that  the}' 
might  enjo}'  a  larger  freedom  in  civil  affairs  than  the}' 
were  allowed  there. 

"If  Kngland  was  sifted  to  obtain  the  choice  grain  that 
planted  Massachusetts,  Massachusetts  was  again  siftetl  to 
obtain  the  choice  grain  that  planted  the  Connecticut  Col- 
ony, in  point  of  civil  liberties.  The  relation  of  these  planta- 
tions in  respect  to  government  was  not  long  in  doubt  ;  for 
they  soon  set  up  a  court,  so-called,  for  themselves,  and  as- 
sttmed  all  the  powers  of  sovereignty  ;  not  only  the  ordin- 
ary atifairs,  but  also  the  extraordinary  powers  of  making 
war  and  peace,  and  contracting  alliances  with  the  Indian 
tribes,  they  boldly  exercised. 

"At  the  court  held  in  l(i3(i  'their  circumstances  were 
such  that  it  was  judged  necessary  for  every  man  to  be  a 
soldier,'  and  in  May,  1()37.  with  matchless  self-reliance, 
nerve  and  grit,   if   not   andacit\,   tlie    court    declared    war

ag'ainst  the  powerful  Peqiiots,  and  raised  an  arinj'  of  90 
men,  wliich  took  the  field  under  command  of  Captain 
John  Mason,  against  the  enemj-,  and  after  a  great  victory 
over  the  Peqnots  in  their  strong;liolds  east  of  the  Thames, 
a  remnant  of  the  enemj-  fled  to  the  west,  and  secreted 
themselves  in  the  great  swamp  now 'in  the  limits  of  Fair- 
field county,  where  they  were  conquered  and  destroyed  as 
a  tribe  b}'  the  colonists.  'Roger  Ludlow  and  some  of  the 
principal  gentlemen  of  the  river  settlements'  accompan- 
ied the  ami}'.  Thej'  were  probabh^  the  first  Englishmen 
who  had  seen  this  beautiful  territor3^  It  was  in  June, 
and  they  were  charmed  with  the  situation,  and  spread 
most  favorable  reports  of  its  features  and  prospects. 

"The  gentlemen  who  settled  New  Haven  arrived  in 
Boston  in  the  Fall  of  1637,  and  stimulated  hy  these  reports, 
they  sailed  from  Boston,  and  earl}^  in  1638  founded  New 
Haven,  which  with  Milford  and  a  few  other  towns,  had  a 
colon}'  of  their  own  until  1662.  The  liberal  ideas  of 
Hooker,  Ludlow,  and  others,  who  founded  the  Connecti- 
cut colony,  were  not  pleasing  to  the  New  Haven  col- 
ony, which  agreed  with  Massachusetts  in  allowing-  onl^^ 
church  members  to  vote.  The  Connecticut  principle  was 
stated  b}'  the  gifted  Hooker  in  liis  great  sermon  of  March 
31,  1638 :  'That  the  choice  of  public  magistrates  belongs 
unto  the  people  by  God's  own  allowance,'  who  have  the 
power  'also,  to  set  the  botinds  and  limitations  of  the  power 
and  place  unto  which  they  call  them.' 

"Let  us  rejoice  that  in  the  same  j^ear,  1639,  from  the 
same  bodj-  of  freemen,  who  had  the  genius  and  the  will  to 
frame  that  instrument,  came  our  fathers  into  this  goodlj' 
land  of  Cupheag,  and  established  for  themselves,  and 
their  successors,  a  township,  where,  assuredl}',  all  these 
j^ears,  those  great  principles  of  civil  government  have 
been  preserved. 

"Indeed  it  seems  to  be  clear  that  they  did  not  wait  to 
bu}'  the  lands  from  the  Indians.  The  Paugussett  Indians 
living  hereabouts  were  treated  as  allies  of  the  Pequots, 
and  conquered  with  them  'to  maintain  their  right  which 
God  b}'  conquest  had  given  to  them.' 

"The  quieting-  of  the  title  of  the  Indians  was  legallj' 
secured  b}'  a  decision  of  the  court  in  16.i9,  and  morallj' 
secured  b}'  deeds  from  the  Indians  in  1671. 


32  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

"Rev.  Hixgh  Peters  wrote  in  166():  'In  seven  j^ears 
among  thousands  there  dwelling-  I  never  saw  any  driink, 
nor  heard  any  oath,  nor  any  begging,  nor  Sabbath 
broken.' 

"Sechford  wrote  :  'Profane  swearing,  drunkennes  and 
beggars  are  but  rare  in  the  compass  of  this  patent, 
through  the  circiiinspection  of  the  magistrates,  and  the 
Providence  of  God  hitherto,  the  poor  then  living  \^y  their 
labors  and  great  wages,  proportionablj'  better  than  the 
rich,  b}^  their  flocks,  which  without  exceeding  great  care 
quicklj^  waste.'     And  Cotton  Mather  called  this  'Utopia.'" 

For  nearly  two  hundred  years  mail  was  brotight  to  Stratford 
b)-  the  coach. 

"As  soon  as  the  mail  was  received  at  the  post  office 
the  bag  was  opened  and  its  contents  emptied  tipon  the 
tloor  behind  the  counter.  The  letters  for  Stratford  were 
then  separated  from  those  destined  for  points  further  east, 
which  latter  were  thrown  again  into  the  bag  with  other 
mail  matter  from  Stratford,  the  bag  secured  and  given  to 
the  stage  driver.  Postage  in  those  days  amounted  to 
something.  Twenty-five  cents  was  charged  on  a  single 
letter  froin  New  Orleans  or  Savannah.  Letters  were  sel- 
dom prepaid,  and  an  entry  in  a  book  was  made  on  the  ar- 
rival of  each  mail  of  the  address  on  each  letter  and  tlie 
ainount  of  postag-e  dtie  thereon.  In  winter  the  distrilm- 
tion  was  made  by  the  light  of  tallow  dips  which  had  to  be 
snuffed  about  a  dozen  times  in  the  course  of  one  sifting  of 
the  mail." 

Public  Opinio7t  saj'S  : 

"Less  than  sixty  j^ears  ago  there  was  reall}'  no  postal 
system  in  this  country.  Previous  to  1847  the  mails  were 
carried  by  private  firms,  and  rates  varied  according  to 
distance.  Carriers  often  traveled  on  foot  or  horseback, 
and  the  progress  was  slow.  In  1846  some  of  the  jjostoffices 
issued  stamps  of  their  own,  called  'provisional  issues.' 
The  adhesive  stamp  was  first  used  in  this  countrj'  in  1847, 
and  ])repayment  was  made  compulsorj-  in  1856.  In  186r{ 
the  stamp  containing  the  head  of  Andrew  Jackson  was  is- 
sued, and  from  then  until  188o  the  style  adopted  contained 
the  profiles  of  presidents  of  the  United  States." 


THE  BEGINNINQ  OF  STRA.TFIELO. 

Samuel  Beardsle3'  and  his  descendants  have  been  so  closely 
identified  with  the  first  church  of  Stratfield  (now  Bridgeport) 
that  a  short  historj^  of  it  will  not  be  out  of  place,  and  I  am  sure 
will  be  read  with  interest  by  the  Beardsley  family. 

For  more  than  fifty  years  after  the  first  settlement  of  Strat- 
field, the  planters  possessed  no  church  of  their  own,  but  were 
forced  to  attend  service  upon  the  Sabbath,  either  at  Stratford  or 
Fairfield.  In  winter  or  in  stormy  weather  this  must  have  been 
very  inconvenient. 

The  place  having-  increased  in  size  somewhat,  application 
was  made  to  the  General  Court  (legislature)  for  permit  to  organ- 
ize a  society  and  to  build  a  church.  In  the  year  1690  ecclesiastical 
privileges  were  granted  to  the  "parish  of  Stratfield,"  which  con- 
sisted of  Richard  Hubbell,  Isaac  Wheeler,  James  Benedict,  Sam- 
uel Beardsley,  John  Odell,  Jr.,  Saiuuel  Gregory,  Mathew  Sherman, 
Richard  Hubbell,  Jr.,  and  David  Sherman. 

The  foundation  of  a  house  of  worship  was  laid  1694,  on  an 
eminence  in  the  upper  part  of  Division  Street,  a  few  rods  south 
of  the  King's  highwa\'.  The  height  affords  a  pleasant  view  of 
the    surrounding    country,   and     is    still     called     "Meeting  House 

Htiir 

Rev.  Charles  Chaunce}',  a  young  man  of  2.5  years  of  age 
whose  father  was  the  Congregational  minister  of  Stratford,  be- 
cauje  their  pastor  at  a  salary  of  £G0  per  annum,  payable  in  pro- 
visions at  the  market  rate.  This  sum  was  afterwards  increased 
to  £80  per  year. 

In  June,  1695,  the  new  meeting  house  was  completed,  and  up- 
on the  13th  was  opened  for  worship.  Mr.  Chaunce^'  was  ordained 
pastor.  It  is  now  known  as  the  "First  Congregational  Church'' 
of  Bridgeport. 


/&gt; 


34  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

For  the  want  of  a  bell  the  worshipers  were  called  together  by 
the  beating-  of  a  drnm. 

The  meeting  house  was  the  place  where  all  school  meetings 
were  held,  and  all  secular  affairs,  requiring  the  gathering  of  the 
people,  transacted. 

Mr.  Chauncey's  ministry  lasted  (until  his  death,  Dec.  31,  1714) 
for  over  twenty  years,  during  which  time  the  settlement  and 
church  increased  in  numbers.  Besides  the  Sabbath  services  he 
was  in  the  habit  of  delivering  a  religious  lecture  once  in  seven 
weeks,  according  to  the  custom  of  the  times,  beginning  each 
when  the  sun  was  at  least  three  hours  high,  and  undoubted!}' 
lasting  until  sundown. 

On  Sunday  afternoon  the  youth  of  both  sexes  were  assembled 
in  church  and  catechised  publicly.  No  levity  of  manner  was  al- 
lowed on  such  occasions,  but  it  appears  that  even  Puritan  j'oung 
people  were  sometimes  tempted  in  that  direction,  as  is  shown  hy 
the  society's  record  books  : 

"Voted  that  Nathaniel  VVackle  (Wakeley)  should  be 
the  man  to  look  after  36  boys  a  Sabbath  daN'S  in  time  of 
exercise,  tfiat  they  play  not." 

Besides  the  Catechism,  "ye  boj's"  were  taught  upon  week 
da}'s  to  read,  write  and  cipher,  at  least  in  the  winter  season. 

After  no  little  parle3'ing  the  societ}-  voted,  on  June  21,  171.^,  to 
extend  a  call  to  the  Rev.  Samuel  Cooke,  of  New  Haven,  offering 
him  £100  sterling. 

The  following  is  a  verbatim  copy  of  his  letter  of  acceptance  : 

"To  the  Worshipful  Mr.  James  Bennett  and  the  other 
Gentlemen  of  the  Comte  apinted  hy  the  Sosiet}'  of  Strat- 
field  to  treat  with  me: — Gentlemen  plas  to  inform  30ur 
Sosiely  that  I  am  content  to  sarve  them  in  3'e  minestry  as 
soon  as  Convenient  provided  they  Agree  Charfull3'  and 
unanimousl3'  to  pa3'  ine  100  pounds  pr  annum  so  long  as 
I  shall  sarfe  them  in  that  capasit3%  to  be  pad  in  Corant 
Mone3'  of  this  Colon3',  or  provisions  at  the  following, 
Rates,  viz : 

"Indian  2s.,  ry  at  2s.  8d.,  wheat  at  4s.  pr  bushel,  pork  at 
20s.  pr  cwt.,and  also  to  provide  me  firewood  annuall}',  as 


THE   BEGINNING   OF  STRATFIELD.  35 

much  as  I  shall  have  occasion  for  the  3'ous  of  \\\y  faiiiil}', 
provided  I  meet  with  no  discouragements  now  unseen. 
"I  am  Gentemen  your  lieart}'  wel  wisher 
"&amp;  humble  Sarvt, 

"Saml  Cooke." 

Mr.  Cooke's  terms  were  accepted,  and  he  shortl}'  after  came 
to  Stratfield. 

On  public  occasions  he  always  appeared  in  full  ministerial 
costume,  which  was  a  heav}^  curled  wig-,  black  coat  and  small 
clothes,  shoes  fastened  with  silver  buckles,  and  over  all  a  large 
cloak,  or  gown. 

The  two  sexes  occupied  opposite  sides  of  the  house,  and  were 
seated  by  a  committee  appointed  for  that  purpose  once  a  year, 
according  to  their  different  social  position,  or,  as  the  old  record 
has  it,  "hy  dignit3\  adge.  and  state." 

The  precedent  was  followed  until  quite  a  recent  period — 
about  1870 — usuall}'  the  females  occupying  the  right  and  males 
the  left  of  the  pulpit.  The  olden  style  churches  usually  were 
entered  b}'  two  doors,  men  entering  the  one  and  women  the 
other.     Tfiere  were  occasional  exceptions. 

Returning  to  our  subject  we  find  in  1717,  in  the  "Stratfield 
Paristi,"  William  Beardsle}',  Sen.,  Daniel  Beardsley,  John  Beards- 
lej'.  Sen.,  Nathan  Beardsley,  William  Beardslej',  Jun.,  Kbenezer 
Beardsley,  David  Beardsley,  John  Beardsle\',  Jun.,  Obadiah 
Beardsle3\     All  were  householders.

38  GENEALOGICAL   HISTORY. 

Here  I  wish  to  record  the  convictions  formed  after  sixt3' -years 
of  observation.  The  intoxicatino;  ciip  is  the  greatest  curse  of 
hutiianit3\  It  is  the  direct  canse  of  three-fourths  of  all  the  crime 
and  povert}'  in  our  boasted  civilization. 

The  author  has  crossed  the  Atlantic  Ocean  four  times,  and 
has  sailed  nearl}'  around  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  crossed  the  Irish 
and  English  Channels,  as  well  as  the  North  Sea,  and  has  visited 
Ireland,  Scotland,  England,  France,  Switzerland,  Italy,  Egypt, 
Palestine,  Syria,  Asia  Minor,  Constantinople,  Greece,  Austria, 
Prussia,  Germany,  Holland,  and  has  never  found  it  necessary  to 
use  liquor  of  anj'  kind, 

The  drink  habit  is  universally  injurious,  and  no  one  can  af- 
ford to  indulge.  It  never  pays.  The  returns  are  not  equal  to  the 
expenditure,  for,  "at  last  it  biteth  like  a  serpent  and  stingeth  like 
an  adder."    "Whosoever  is  deceived  thereby  is  not  wise."

9,1726;  d.  — ;  m.  Ann,  dau.  of  Samuel  Canfield,  of  New  Milford, 
Conn.  He  settled  in  Newburgh,  N.  Y.,  on  the  west  bank  of  the 
Hudson,  where  he  worked  at  harness  making  and  saddlery  pre- 
vious to  and  during  the  Revolutionary  War,  Family  tradition 
says  he  repaired  harness  and  saddles  for  Lafayette's  army,  and 
no  doubt  for  Gen.  Washington's  as  well. 

About  1790  he  removed  to  Hardestown,  Sussex  co.,  N.  J.,  where 
Charles,  a  younger  brother,  had  resided  for  several  years. 

When  the  English  troops  vacated  New  York,  April  26,  1783, 
one  of  his  sons,  Beverly  Robinson,  went  with  them  to  New  Bruns- 
wick.

Waterville,  Dec.  23,  1896.  A  Presbyterian.  Married  Cornelia  Eliza 
Pangman  May  5,  1843 ;  she  d.  Sept.  9,  1892. 

A  few  extracts  from  extended  notices  of  him  in  the  "Waterville 
Times,"  N.  Y.,  Dec.  25,  1896,  will  show  the  character  and  worth  of 
the  man  : 

"The  death  of  Backus  A.  Beardslej'  occurred  at  his  home 
in  Waterville,  Saturday,  about  9  A.  M.  Mr.  Beardsley  suf- 
fered an  apoplectic  shock  about  two  weeks  ago  and  had 
rapidly  failed  since  then.  His  grandfather,  Gersham 
Beardsley,  was  a  ph3'sican  and  druggist  in  New  Haven, 
Conn.,  and  at  the  time  of  the  Revolutionary  War,  entered 
and  served  as  surgeon  under  Cols.  Parsons,  Tyler  and 
Huntington.  He  also  served  in  the  war  of  1812.  Later  he 
resided  at  Cheshire,  Conn.,  where  Rev.  Evans  Beardsle3^ 
father  of  the  deceased,  was  born.  He  was  a  natural  me- 
chanic and  invented  and  manufactured  many  useful 
things,  among  which  were  the  bark  mill,  a  cook  stove,  hop 
stove  and  hop  press.  In  1840  he  purchased  the  furnace 
business  in  Waterville,  N.  Y'.,  and  here  continued  in  the 
foundry  and  machine  business  for  some  years. 

"The  stove  which  he  invented  sold  readil5^  When  the 
war  broke  out  he  lost  considerable.  Many  of  the  mills 
which  he  had  made  had  been  sold  south,  and  it  was  im- 
possible to  collect  the  debts  which  were  owing  him  there. 
He  also  turned  his  attention  to  building  public  works, 
and  there  are  quite  a  number  of  these  in  Waterville  which 
stand  as  monuments  to  the  excellence  of  his  workman- 
ship." 

"He  possessed  a  keen  sense  of  humor,  was  a  good  stor3'^ 
teller  and  had  such   a  retentive  memory  that  he  was  al-

teemed by  the  large  number  of  friends  which  he  made 
during  his  long  life  among  them."

dispatches  to  officers  in  command  of  different  posts  in  Northern 
and  Central  Ohio.  Messages  were  conveyed  by  him  to  Gen.  Cass 
at  Zanesville,  Ohio,  to  Gen.  Harrison  at  Fort  Meggs,  and  to  the 
commander  of  Fort  Crognan,  at  Fremont,  Ohio.  In  1834  he 
moved  with  his  family  to  Findley,  Hancock  co.,  Ohio,  where  his 
wife  d.  in  1847.  "This  was  then  an  unpretentious  village.  Here 
was  real  pioneer  life  with  all  its  cares  and  privations.— no  roads, 
no  markets,  no  farms,  and  almost  no  neighbors  ;  surrounded  by 
dense  forests,  inhabited  by  wild  beasts  and  Indians."  Here  he 
lived  until  1856,  when  he  caught  the  western  fever  and  went  to

Birdsej'  Beardslej^  and  lived  on  New  Preston  Hill  man)^  years. 
He  was  sexton  of  the  Presbj'terian  church  a  long  time,  of  which 
he  was  at  one  time  a  Deacon.  He  was  at  that  time  partially  de- 
mented. A  shoemaker  tramp,  named  Rabello,  caine  along  and 
worked  in  the  shop.  His  son,  Harris,  about  12  5-ears  of  age,  built 
the  fires  in  the  shoj^.  One  morning  Harris  did  not  come  to  break- 
fast. His  mother  found  his  body  at  the  woodpile  literally  cut  to 
pieces, — head  cut  off,  one  leg  and  one  arm  severed  from  the  body. 
Eleven  blows  with  an  axe  in  the  hands  of  that  trainp  had  done 
the  work.  When  the  father  saw  the  remains  of  his  son  he  was 
made  rational  in  a  moment,  and  ever  so  remained.  The  criminal 
was  tried,  condemned,  and  died  a  raving  maniac  in  the  prison  at 
Wethersfield,  Conn.

Jul}'  2,  1712,  aged  3o. 

Samuel  Treadwell,  Sen.,  and  Thomas  Hawley  were  the  ap- 
praisers of  the  estate,  which  amounted  to  £108  15s.  Id.  Daniel  and 
John  Beardslej', his  brothers,  were  appointed  administrators  June 
17,  1712  ;  which  was  distributed  to  his  brothers  and  sisters  March 
14, 1726,  each  receiving  £13  3s.  6d.  (Fairfield  P.  R.)  From  the  above 
it  seems  that  he  never  married. 

The  following  will  be  read  with  interest,  showing  the  manner 
of  doing  some  things  in  the  olden  time  : 

"Feb.  3, 1702.  Benjamin  Beardsley,  John  Hall  and  Tom 
bringing  up  a  white  horse  out  of  the  woods,  without  any 
town  brand  on  him,  which  said  horse  with  his  natural  and 
artificial  mark  was  notified  and  sent  to  Fairfield,  Stratfield 
and  Norwalk  and  no  one  appearing  and  no  one  laying 
claiin  to  said  horse  ;  the  Constable  of  Stratford  b5^  advice 
of  authority  ye  day  above  sd.  caused  j^e  drum  to  beat  to 
invite  customers  and  then  at  an  outcrj'  made  sale  of  said 
horse,  and  Samuel  Hawley,  Jr  ,  and  Samuel  Fairchild,  Jr., 
bid  for  said  horse  twenty-three  shillings  in  cash,  and  no 
person  bidding  more  ye  said  constable  delivered  said 
horse  to  said  Hawley  and  Fairchild  ;  the  said  horse  is 
white,  gelt,  dockt,  and  ear  marked.  *  *  *  The  charges  of 
bringing  up  said  hofse  14  shillings  with  sending  to  the 
neighboring  towns  as  above,  to  ye  constable  for  his  labor 
and  pains  three  shillings  ;  and  the  charge  the  entr}^  to  ye 
keeper  of  ye  brand-book  6d." 


Benjamin  Beardsley^  (Daniel^  William'),  b.  about  1702;  d. 
before  1727. 

The  following  record,  found  in  B.  1  p.  13,  shows  that  Daniel 
had  a  son  Benjamin  : 

"Nathan  Beardslej',  Jonathan  Wakelee  and  Mar3%  his 
wife,  all  of  Stratfield,  to  prevent  future  trouble  and  for 
want  of  a  more  formal  settlement  of  the  estate  of  our

quitclaim  to  our  brother  Daniel,  his  heirs,  a  parcel  of 
land  at  Broad  Plaia.     April  11, 1727." 

Nathan  and  Mary  showed  a  very  commendable  spirit.   "Bless-

Benjamin  Reardsley's  estate  was  appraised  by  Samuel  Haw- 
lej^  and  Agur  Beach  between  Aug.  17  and  September  9,  1762,  and 
amounted  to  £1^1  13s.  9d.

now  the  Four  Corners,  a  little  wa3'  east  of  the  school-hoiise.  His 
dwelling  stood  on  the  northwest  corner,  for  when  he  deeded  this 
homevStead  to  his  son  David,  it  was  bounded  south  and  east  by 
the  highwaj  ."  (Stratford  Land  Records  V.  2,  page  18.  Historj^  of 
Stratford.) 

Benjamin  Beardsley  had  thirteen  acres  laid  out  to  him  near 
the  south  end  of  Tashna,  Dec.  25, 1734,  and  in  1735  another  piece  at 
same  place,  and  in  1736  another.     (Book  6,  pp.  219,  210,  224.) 

Daniel  Beardsle},  of  Stratfield,  "in  consideration  of  the  pa- 
rental love  I  have  for  my  son,  Benjamin  Beardsley,  of  Stratfield, 
do  absolutely  give  to  him  land  at  White  Plain,  S^-^  acres."  (Book 
4,  p.  213.) 

"Ann,  Rebecca,  and  Jeremiah  Beardsley,  of  Stratfield,  sells  to 
Benjamin  Beardsley,  of  Stratfield,  all  that  part  and  parts  of  house 
and  lands  which  was  the  inheritance  of  our  brother,  Daniel 
Beardsley,  late  of  Stratfield,  deceased,  at  Ox  Hill."    (Book  4,  p.  128.) 

Benjamin's  will  was  dated  Nov.  3,  1759,  and  proved  April  7, 
1761.  It  begins  with  :  "I  commit  my  soul  to  God,  my  Creator, 
trusting  in  his  mercy  through  Christ  my  Redeemer,  and  my  bod)^ 
to  ye  dust."  In  it  he  says  he  has  "already'  given  his  homestead 
and  30  acres  at  White  Plains"  to  his  "eldest  son,  David,"  and  that 
having  already  given  £300  to  his  "eldest  daughter,  Lois  Porter," 
he  gives  her  "five  shillings"  only.  In  the  will  and  in  the  distribu-

the  olden  time  was  familiar  to  him,  and  his  choir  was  his 

joy." 

An   intelligent  lady  of    Denver,   Colo.,    pronounces    him     the 

most  remarkable  man  she  ever  knew  in  mental   ability   and   deep 

spirituality.     Give  God  the  glory!     Let  no  one  make  light  of  such 

an  experience.

Mrs.  La\ira  Christie,  formerlj'  of  Springfield,  O.,  under  date  of 
Sept.  12,  1884,  describes  their  first  settlement  in  Ohio,  Dec,  1811. 
Two  brothers  had  preceded  them  and  located  in  the  beach  woods 
between  VVorthington  and  Berkshire,  near  the  north  line  of 
Franklin  count}'. 

"We  found  them  in  a  loi&gt;-  cabin  about  20  feet  square, 
with  a  floor  of  logs  split  open  in  the  middle,  with  the  flat 
side  uj).  We  ascended  to  the  loft  above  on  pegs  driven  in 
the  wall.  Fourteen  of  us  lived  there  until  April,  among;- 
the  wolves,  panthers,  coons,  opossoms,  deer,  wild  turkeys 
and  wild  hogs. 

"I  was  a  little  girl  in  my  ninth  year.  It  was  the  fash- 
ion to  send  a  bunch  of  flax  to  the  neighbors  to  be  spun  in- 
to thread,  and  take  it  home  on  a  certain  da3^  and  then 
have  a  good  time.  My  mother  not  being-  well  enough  to 
go  to  the  party,  sent  me  with  the  thread,  which  was  about 
a  mile  from  home  through  the  woods.  When  about  half 
way  I  saw  a  drove  of  wild  hogs  coming  towards  me  with 
their  noses  up  snuffing-  the  air,  grunting  loudl}'.  I  was 
directed  bj-  Providence  to  a  large  tree  that  had  fallen.  I 
climbed  into  the  roots,  and  sat  there  on  my  perch  until 
the  hogs  got  tired  watching  me  and  went  to  their  lodg- 
ings. My  mother  became  uneasy  about  me,  and  sent  my 
brother,  Havilah,  to  hunt  me.  I  was  glad  to  see  him.  I 
do  not  remember  just  how  I  felt,  but  I  was  a  noted  char- 
acter for  some  tinje. 

'•The  next  spring  we  moved  about  eight  miles  into  an- 
other house,  similar  to  the  one  we  had  left.  I  think  it 
must  have  had  a  larger  door  and  fire-place,  for  father 
vised  to  f)lindfold  an  old  horse  and  haul  in  the  back  logs 
to  burn  in  the  fire-place,  which  was  made  of  sticks  and 
daubbed  with  mud,  and  extended  clear  across  the  end  of 
the  house. 

"The  war  of  1812  commenced  that  year.  My  father 
used  to  prepare  for  war  every  night  by  getting  tubs  of 
water  in  the  hottse  in  case  the  Indians  should  set  us  on

GIDEOX  B.  Beardsley'  (GaJ•lord^  Gideon^,  Obadiah*,  John'', 
Samuel-,  William'),  b.  Auo-.  22.  1809,  aboxit  one  mile  north-east  of 
Harperslield  Center,  Delaware  co.,  N.  Y.  ;  m.  (1)  Ann  Titus  Nov.  11, 
18H0.  and  settled  on  a  farm  at  North  Harpersfield,  where  four  sons 
were  b.  to  them.  Mie  d.  Au^.  26,  1846.  He  often  taught  tlie  Dis- 
trict School  dtiring  the  winter. 

One  incident,  illustrative  of  his  character,  will  be  oiven.  In 
the  fall  of  1839,  when  the  author  was  a  lad  of  eight  years,  he  ac- 
companied his  father  to  call  on  the  minister,  Rev.  Arad  S.  Lakin. 
An  hour  or  more  passed  quickly.  Tea  was  read}-,  and  we  were 
cordiall}'^  invited  to  participate.  Father  politely  declined.  His 
e5'es  moistened  when  the  devout  minister  and  his  little  fatnily 
sat  down  to  their  frugal  ineal  of  baked  potatoes  and  salt,  and  in- 
voked the  Divine  blessing. 

After  the  tallow  candle  had  ceased  to  burn  in  the  parsonage, 
which  was  just  across  the  street,  a  short,  heav3'-set  man  might 
have  been  seen  marching  toward  the  "Dominie's,"  carrying  a 
heavj'  load  of  provisions,  with  an  eight-year-old  boy  b}'  his  side, 
equallj'  well  loaded.  At  the  parsonage  the  pantrj'  window  was 
gently  raised,  the  sacks  were  carefullj'  and  noiseless!}'  placed  in- 
side, the  window  closed,  when  two  light  hearts  returned  home  to 
rest  easil}'.  On  the  following  morning,  as  we  were  sitting  down 
to  breakfast,  the  minister  came  hurriedly  in,  and  after  a  pleasant 
"good  morning,"  picked  up  the  famil}'  Bible  and  read  a  chapter, 
then  knelt  and  offered  a  most  fervent  prayer.  All  were  in  tears. 
Without  another  word  he  replaced  the  dear  old  book  and  returned 
to  his  home. 

About  this  time  ni}'  parents  were  converted.  Father  realized 
a  call  to  the  work  of  the  ministry,  but  feeling,  like  man}^  others, 
wholly  unqualified  for  so  important  a  work,  he  failed  to  respond. 
Mother's  conversion  was  remarkable  for  its  clearness  and  spirit- 
ual assurance.  Years  after,  an  aged  Christian  who  was  present, 
said  to  the  writer,  "Your  mother's  face  shone  as  that  of  an  angel." 
She  lived  her  religion  and  taught  her  sons  to  fear  God  and  love 
the  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  Her  prayers  were  ever  ascending  that  her 
sons  might  become  useful  ministers  of  the  Gospel.  Though  she 
never  lived  to  see  her  praj^ers  answered,  yet  two  of  them  have 
spent,  combined,  nearly  a  century  in  the  ministry  of  the  Word. 

He  m.  (2)  Kve  Ann  Multer,  of  South  Wooster,  N.  Y.  Moved  sub- 
sequently to  the  "Dug  Way"  in  Schoharie  co.,  where  he  d.  June  18, 
1852.

went  to  the  horse  car  barns  to  receive  the  earnings  of  the 
road  for  the  previous  da}-,  and  deposit  them  in  the  bank. 
As  he  was  returning  to  his  home  a  siidden  illness,  accom- 
panied with  pains  in  the  stomach,  seized  him,  and  on 
reaching  his  residence  he  was  obliged  to  go  to  bed,  and 
soon  breathed  his  last.  The  doctors  ascribe  death  to  heart 
failure.  The  deceased  had  just  passed  the  61st  year  of  his 
ag:e.     He  leaves  a  wife  to  mourn  his  death."

count of  the  persecutions  directed  against  them  as  Christians. 
He  used  to  hide  his  Bible  under  the  hearth  of  his  fire-place,  and 
at  midnight  he  would  get  it  and  read  to  his  famil)\  He  d.  March 
25, 1820,  aged  83. 

His  will  reads  as  follows:  "I  give  and  recommend  mj^  soulinto 
the  hands  of  God  who  gave  it,  hoping-  through  the  merits,  death 
and  passion  of  m^-  Saviour,  Jesus  Christ,  to  have  the  full  pardon 
of  all  n\Y  sins  and  to  inherit  everlasting-  life.  I  commit  my  body 
to  the  g^round  in  hope  of  the  restirrection  by  the  might}'  power  of 
God.''  He  mentions  his  wife  and  all  his  children.  To  Abigail,  the 
joungest,  he  gives  "the  loom  with  the  harness,  and  brass  kettle." 
By  trade  a  blacksmith. 

During-  the  Revolutionar}'  War  he  was  a  non-combatant — 
called  a  "Tory.''  but  he  returned  the  compliment  b)^  calling-  them 
"Rebels."  Although  an  Kpiscopalian,  the  preaching-  of  the  early 
Methodists  led  him  to  seek  a  deeper  work  of  g-race,  and  having- 
received  the  full  baptism  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  became  very  zealous 
in   the  cause  of  Christ. 

He  was  fond  of  trapping-,  and  it  is  claiinedthat  he  caught  one 
hundred  and  one  foxes,  two  otters,  two  skunks,  a  great  many 
musk-rats  and  crows  almost  without  number.  He  often  said  "a 
pure  unadulterated  Beardsle}'  would  be  immortal."  He  always 
claimed  that  one  of  the  characteristics  of  the  family  "was  an  un- 
tlinching-  integrity." 

The  anvil  which  he  beg-an  to  use  in  1760  is  now  (1890)  in  pos- 
session of  his  grandson,  Irad  L.  Beardsle}',  of  Brookhn,  N.  Y.

Beardsley  Hollow.  His  was  a  cheerful  home  for  the  itiner-

who  would  assemble  to  hear.  About  the  year  1820,  the  primi-

children,  not  only  from  the  elements,  but  also  from  prowl-

with  fragrant  pine  shingles  from  apex  of  roof  to  founda-

The  huge  ichimne}',  centrally  located,  extended  from  base-

inch  long.  Flat  on  top.  Four  inches  below  the  top  is  a  hole 
through  the  wood  lined  with  ivor5^  A  cord  passes  through  the 
hole  with  tassels  close  up,  which  were  probabl}^  once  red,  but 
faded  now.  On  the  top  and  side  of  the  ivory  is  this  date,  "1691." 
This  remarkable  cane  has  come  down  through  the  generations,

218  GEN Eyi LOGIC/} L  HISTORY. 

James  W.  Beakdsley'  (Elisha  H.',,  Elisha',  Israel^  Thomas', 
Joseph2,  Williami),  b.  18!^!,  Monroe,  Conn.  ;  d.  Jan.  1,  1893. 

He  resided  on  a  farm  at  Bridgeport,  Conn.,  and  was  not  only 
a  farmer  but  a  stock  i&gt;rower  of  no  mean  proportions. 

He  also  owned  a  laroe  farm  of  several  hundred  acres  near 
Coldwater,  Mich.,  on  which  he  grew  trotting  horses  of  the  very 
best  bloods.  This  farm  is  in  charge  of  a  nephew.  He  gave  to  the 
city  of  Bridgeport,  a  few  jears  ago.  a  tract  of  land,  in  the  north- 
east part  of  town,  known  as  "Beardsley's  Park,"  which  is  being- 
improved  and  beautified  by  the  city. 

This  is  a  romantic  spot  of  earth  and  rock  on  the  east  side  of 
the  Pequonnock  River,  and  from  its  most  elevated  point  overlook- 
ing cit}',  harbor  and  bay.     The  view  is  almost  unsurpassed. 

On  the  north-east  of  the  park  was  his  residence,  where  some 
members  of  the  family  have  lived  since  1739.  The  house  is  a  well 
preserved  old  mansion,  and  was  a  great  favorite  of  its  bachelor 
owner,  who  drove  one  of  the  finest  stepi^ers  it  was  the  privilege 
of  the  writer  ever  to  have  ridden  after. 

One  evening,  near  Christmas  time,  his  home  was  entered  by 
two  masked  men  who  demanded  his  money;  he  resisted,  and  the 
injuries  received  resulted  in  the  close  of  his  earthly  career  on  New 
Year's  day  1893. 

He  was  a  loyal  citizen  and  a  perfect  gentleman.  He  left  a  large 
property'  to  his  near  relatives.

17m,  Stratford,  Fairfield  oo.,  Cotin.  ;  ni.  Hannah  Gifford  in  Middle- 
town,  Conn.  They  moved  to  Hennini&gt;ton,  Vermont,  l)efore  the 
battle  which  occurred  there.  Afterward  the}'  lived  in  Charlotte, 
and  about  the  5'ear  1791  crossed  I,ake  Champlain,  near  where 
Plattsburg  now  stands,  and  settled  in  what  is  now  known  as  Peru, 
Clinton  CO.,  N.  Y.     A  grandda tighter  wrote  : 

"The  advent  was  one  to  be  remembered.  They  had 
their  household  goods,  provisions  to  last  until  others 
could  be  grown,  horses,  three  cows,  sheep  and  poultr}'  and 
sixtj'  slaves.  They  squatted  on  200  acres  of  land  (which, 
when  surveyed,  was  purchased  of  the  Government  at  $1.25 
per  acre)  near  the  Great  Ansable  River,  but  thirteen  miles 
from  the  lake  westward.  There  \vere  no  roads,  no  clear- 
ings, nor  dwellings  of  an}'  kind  in  that  country. 

"They  were  among-  the  first,  if  not  the  first,  to  enter  the 
unbroken  forest.  A  narrow  path  was  cleared  and  their 
effects  carried  on  horseback  to  the  river  banks,  where  a 
rude  cabin  was  erected,  which  sheltered  their  warm  and 
hopeful  hearts,  ground  cleared  and  a  crop  put  in  that 
spring.  Here  he  freed  all  his  slaves  as  they  came  of  age, 
providing  for  the  old  ones  Here  he  reared  his  large  fam- 
ily to  man  and  womanhood,  and  here  he  died  in  1846,  at 
the  advanced  age  of  112  years,  leaving-  a  handsome  prop- 
erty to  his  heirs. 

■'He  was  a  firm  believer  in  an  all-wise  and  over-ruling 
Providence  all  the  daj's  of  his  life,  and  sank  forest  in  a 
golden  old  age." 

He  was  a  soldier  in  the  War  of  the  Revolution.

(Rev.)  Joh.n  Hkakdsley''  (JohnS  Jolm^  Joseph-,  William^,  b, 
April  23,  1732,  at  Ripton.  Conn.,  and  d.  April  23,  1810,  at  Kingston. 
Canada,  jnst  78  j-ears  of  age.  Graduated  from  King's  (now  Colum- 
bia) College.  N.  Y.,  with  the  degree  of  B.  A.,  in  1761.  His  first  pub- 
lic services  were  as  hay  Reader,  when  he  "read  pra5-ers  and  ser- 
mons to  ver3'  good  acceptance. "  Rev.  Dr.  Punderson  recommend- 
ed him  to  the  "Societj^  for  the  Propagation  of  the  Gospel  in  For- 
eiyn  Parts,"  organized  in  1711,  and  the  successor  of  one  organized 
in  1648  to  extend  the  Gospel  in  New  England,  as  a  person  suitable 
for  missionary  work.  In  the  spring  of  1761,  he,  with  two  others, 
sailed  for  England  to  secure  ordination. 

Immediately  after  his  return  he  was  appointed  missionary  at 
Norwich  and  Groton,  a  position  which  lie  filled  satisfactoril}-  for 
about  five  3-ears.  Oct.  26,  176(5,  he  was  tranvSferred^  by  his  own  re- 
quest, to  Poughkee.psie,  N.  Y.,  which  parish  had  been  organized 
on  the  23rd  instant,  previous,  and  was  incorporated  by  Royal 
Charter,  March  9,  1773.  In  addition  to  Christ  Church,  Pough- 
keepsie.  he  had  charge  of  Trinity  Church,  Fishkill.  He  remained 
there  over  eleven  j'ears. 

Upon  the  outbreak  of  the  American  Revohition,  he  deemed  it 
his  duty  to  remain  loyal  to  the  King  of  Kngland,  as  he  had  sworn 
allegiance  at  the  time  of  his  ordination.  Shortly  after  the  Com- 
mittee of  Safely  arrested  him  as  a  Tory  and  confiscated  his  prop- 
erty. He,  with  his  family,  took  refuge  in  New  York  City  Dec.  16, 
1777.     The  following  year  he  resided  on  Long  Island. 

Colonel  Beverley  Robinson,  a  prominent  Loyalist,  had  been 
his  parishioner  at  Fiskill,  and  upon  his  raising  the  "Loj^al  Ameri- 
can Regiment  for  the  King's  service,  '  the  Rev.  John  Beardslej-,  on 
April  2.-!,  1778,  was  appointed  Chaplain  of  the  regiment.  He 
shared  its  fortunes  dnring  the  war,  and  at  the  close  accompanied 
it  to  New  Brunswick. 

On  the  19th  of  April,  17S3,  the  transport  "Union"left  New  York 
Cit}-  with  209  Lo3'alists  on  board,  and  landed  Maj' 10 — 14  da 5^8  en 
route--on  the  rugged  rocks  where  the  city  of  St.  John's,  N.  B.,  now 
stands. 

He  was  the  first  clergyman  of  any  denomination  to  minister, 
spiritually-,  to  the  needs  of  those  "exiles."  He  did  not  confine  his 
lahors  to  this  one  localitj',  but,  on  foot  and  in  canoes,  he  went 
wherever  settlers  had  gone,  doin'4  the  work  of  a  godly  pastor. 


236  GENEALOGIC/1L  HISTORY. 

He  was  Chaplain  of  the  "King's  New  Brunswick  Regiment" 
from  1793  to  1802,  and  during  his  natural  life  received  a  Chap- 
lain's half  pay  from  the  British  Government. 

He  was  an  enthusiastic  Mason  and  organized  the  first  Masonic 
Lodge  in  New  Brunswick,  of  Avhich  he  was  the  Worthy  Master. 

He  wrote  a  long  letter  to  his  brothers  Austin  and  Charles, 
Aug.  21,  1792,  at  "Hardwick  Town,  Sussex  Co.,  State  of  New  Jersey." 
This  letter  was  copied  for  publication  here,  but  lack  of  space  pre- 
cluded. 

In  Jul}^,  1805,  he  visited  his  old  missions  at  Poughkeepsie  and 
Fishkill,  and  probably  his  numerous  relatives  in  New^  Jersey. 

Married  (1)  .Sjlvia,  daughter  of  Rev.  Dr.  Punderson,  about 
1766.  She  died  about  1773.  M.  (2)  Anna,  daughter  of  Bartholomew

called  "the  homely  fiddler'  on  account  of  an  enormous  Roinan 
nose.  Once  he  was  playing  for  the  amusement  of  the  guests  of  a

among  his  wares  a  large  ugly  knife,  which  he  gave  to  the  fiddler, 
remarking  "that  he  was  the  homeliest  man  he  had  ever  met."  The 
next  morning  it  was  found  that  his  harness  was  cut  in  pieces.

to  a  homely,  sensitive  fiddler."     Shoemaker.     Methodist.

"I  never  was  discharged,  never  reprimanded  hy  a  su- 
perior, never  short  one  cent  in  my  accounts.     After  rub- 
bing- against  all  kinds  of  people   during    these   3'ears,   I 
think  the  Beardsleys  are  the  most  peculiar  people  I  ever 
met.     1  have  never  seen  people  like  them.     I  do  not  think 
it  is  in  theblood  of  a  genuine  Heardslej'  to  do  a  wilful  wrong. 
I  believe  that  ever3^  case  of  wrongdoing,  or  meanness,  can 
be  traced  to  an  improper  cross  with  some  unworthy  fam- 
il3'.     When  a  bo3'  I  used  to  hear  conversations  between  my 
grandfather  and  others  like  this:  'Father,  if  you  could  find 
a    real    simonpure    Beardsley,    he    would    be     immortal, 
wouldn't  he  ?'     The  old   man  would  answer  :  'As  near  as

On  April  4,  1885,  Mr.  Beardsley  saw  an  old  bible  advertised,  by 
a  firm  in  Bristol,  England,  and  printed  by  John  Field,  1666,  bound 


322  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

in  heavy  calf,  634  x  9  x  214  inches  in  size,  nonpareil  type,  known  as 
the  Preacher's  Bible.  This  book  he  purchased.  On  pa^e  lo,  by 
count,  (the  book  is  not  paged)  there  is  written,  in  a  clear  and 
legible  hand,  the  name  of  "Samuel  Beardsley,"  probably  the  orig- 
inal owner  of  the  book,  over  the  words:  "The  order  of  morning- 
prayer  daily  through  the  year,"  The  name  of  "John  Beardsley" 
is  on  the  first  page. 

In  Rev.  John  Wesley's  works  are  copies  of  letters  written  to 
the  Rev.  Samuel  Beardsley.  Is  he  the  same  person  whose  name  is 
written  in  the  above  described  bible? 

The  following  are  verbatim  copies  of  the  letters  : 
To  the  Rev.  Samuel  Beardsley  1772: 

"Dear  Sammy, —  It  is  a  great  blessing  that  your  fellow- 
laborers  and  you  are  all  of  one  mind.  When  that  is  so 
the  work  of  the  Lord  prospers  in  your  hands.  It  will  go 
on  widening,  as  well  as  deepening,  while  you  draw  in 
one  yoke.  If  you  desire  it  should  deepen  in  believers,  con- 
tinually exhort  them  to  go  on  unto  perfection  ;  steadily  to 
use  all  the  grace  they  have  received,  and  every  moment  to 
expect  full  salvation.  The  "Plain  Account  of  Christian 
Perfection"  you  should  read  j^ourself,  more  than  once,and 
recommend  it  to  all  thataregroaning  for  lull  redemption." 
Again  in  1779 : 

"The  more  pains  yo\x  take  the  more  blessing  jou  will 
find ;  especially  in  preaching  full  salvation,  receivable 
now,  b}'  faith. 

"Kxhort  all  believers,  strongly  and  explicitly,  to  go  on 
to  perfection,  and  to  expect  everj^  blessing  God  has  prom- 
ised, not  to  morrow,  but  to-day. 

"Everywhere  exhort  the  believers  to  expect  full  salva- 
tion now  by  simple  faith"  (p.  131).

Lansin*;-,  Tomi^kins  co.,  X.  Y.,  in  1828,  where  he  has  been  merchant 
and  postmaster  ever  since. 

Nelson  Beardslej^  his  brother,  was  law  partner  with  William 
H.  Seward,  and  in  the  course  of  a  conversation  concerning  Ros- 
well,  it  was  suggested  that  it  might  be  of  use  to  him  to  be  post- 
master of  the  place  where  he  was  living.     Mr.  Seward  iinmediatel}' 


334  GENEALOGICAL  HISTORY. 

interested  himself  in  the  matter.  A  few  days  later  Mr.  Beardslej^ 
received  his  commission,  sii^ned  by  the  then  Postmaster  General, 
John  McLean  ;  and  this  was  the  first  knowled^'e  he  liad  that  an3'- 
thing-  of  the  sort  was  on  foot.  The  cotnmission  still  hano;s  in  his 
office,  and  is  the  only  one  he  has  ever  had.  This  commission 
from  President  John  Quinc}'  Adams  bears  date  of  June  28,  1828. 
He  was  in  his  nineteenth  jear  when  he  received  his  appointment, 
and  is  therefore  93  years  of  age.  Eleven  jears  ago  he  stated  that 
"he  had  been  able  to  make  his  own  quarterly  returns  with  only 
two  or  three  interruptions  during  all  of  thia  long-  period.  He  has 
mailed  letters  of  some  of  the  families  of  his  neighborhood  for  five 
generations.  The  revenue  from  the  office  for  many  years  did  not 
exceed  $15  or  $20,  but  after  the  coming  of  the  railroad  it  had  risen 
to  $170. 

All  of  his  life  Mr.  Beardsley  has  kept  a  small  country  store  at 
North  Lansing,  more  popularly  known  as  Beardsley's  Corners, 
and  he  has  amassed  an  independent  competence.  His  unbroken 
service  is  the  longest  in  the  history  of  American  office  holding. 
He  and  his  wife  (still  living)  celebrated  their  golden  wedding  an- 
niversary 24  3'ears  ago.  The  NeAV  York  Geographical  Society'  of- 
ferred  him  a  large  price  for  his  commi.ssion  when  it  was  60  3'ears 
old,  but  he  refused. 

In  his  beautiful  home,  with  its  luxuriant  furnishings  and 
pleasant  surroundings,  he  passes  much  of  his  time,  where  his 
friends,  whose  name  is  legion,  are  tlirice  welcomed  and  hospitabl}' 
received. 

So  firm  he  strode  across  the  room, 

So  statel3^  was  his  air. 
You  scarce  had  guessed  that  ninety  years 
Had  whitened  throiigh  his  hair. 

A  perfect  gentleman  of  the  old  school;  a  lover  of  books;  a 
friend  to  science  and  education,  and  a  firm  believer  in  the  broad 
principles  of  humanit}' — schools,  colleges,  universities,  churches 
and  benevolent  societies  alike  receive  liberal  benefits  from  bis 
bountiful  hands.  The  cut  is  reproduced  from  a  recent  photo- 
graph. 

On  the  28th  of  June,  1902,  a  large  number  of  friends  and  neigh- 
bors gathered  at  his  home  to  celebrate  the  74tli  anniversary  of 
his  appointment  as  postmaster.  Should  he  live  one  year  more 
there  will  be  a  grander  celebration  of  that  remarkable  event.  He

William  Beardsley-^  (William*,  William^,  Daniel-,  William'),  b. 
about  1760.  in  Rhode  Island.  At  the  ag-e  of  18  he  ran  awa}'  from 
home  and  enlisted  in  the  Colonial  army,  against  his  parents' 
wish,  and  served  as  a  drummer-bo3^  until  the  close  of  the  Revolu- 
tionar}^  War. 

Soon  after  he  went  to  Connecticut  and  married  Elizabeth 
Lothrup,  the  daughter  of  a  Presbyterian  minister  in  Connecticut, 
and  started  to  what  was  then  known  as  the  "Far  West,''  settling 
tirst  in  the  town  of  Galwa)%  where  the  village  cemetery  now 
stands  ;  afterwards  to  the  town  of  Providence,  Saratoga  co..  N.  Y., 
\vhicli  was  onl}^  a  short  distance  from  the  first  location. 

There  were  no  re  ads  ;  the  trails  followed  the  water-courses  or 
the  "blazed  trees"'  through  the  dense  forests,  where  the  wild  beasts 
roamed  at  will  and  the  war  whoop  of  the  Indian  had  not  yet  died 
awaj^  and  no  schools,  no  churches,  no  society. 

Here  they  erected  a  log  cabin,  cleared  a  patcli  of  ground,  and 
began  life  in  real  earnest.  Soon  they  tinited  with  the  First  Bap- 
tist Church,  an  org-anization  of  14  members.  Thej'  vvorshiped  in 
a  log  barn  on  Avhat  is  now  known  as  Baptist  Hill,  three-fourths  of 
a  mile  below  where  East  Galway  now  stands.  In  1813  this  church 
was  moved  itito  the  village,  remodeled,  and  is  now  lOo  years  old. 
Its  threshhold  has  been  worn  away  1)\'  the  constant  tread  of  the 
hundreds  who  have  been  borne  awa3^  to  the  land  beyond. 

He  never  saw,  or  heard  from  his  father's  family  after  that 
eventful  night  wlien  he  left  to  join  the  army.

gave  her  a  quaint  old  table,  which  belonged  to  'DanieP,"  and  had

Jesse,  and  later  to  his  great-grandson  William,  and  in  succession 
to  his  great-great  granddaughter  Lois,  and  at  her  deatii  to  John 
M.  Beardsle3^of  Bethel,  Fairfield  co.,  Conn.  It  is  believed  that  the

I.— THE  ANCESTRY  OF  WILLIAM  BEARDSLEY. 

Thus  far  in  this  work  we  have  traced  the  history  of  the  de- 
scendants of  William  Beardslej^  from  1635  to  the  pi'esent.  In  the 
progress  of  this  stiid}'  facts  have  been  discovered  and  questions 
suggested  which  call  for  separate  treatment.  Some  of  these  we 
will  briefly  consider  here.  The  one  most  prominent — "Who  were 
the  English  ancestors  of  William  Beardsley?"  "Who  was  his 
father?"    "Where  did  he  live?"  etc. — will  be  first  considered. 

In  the  Spring  of  1891,  the  author  visited  England  and  ear- 
nestly sought  for  the  information  to  answer  authoritatively  all 
these,  but  without  satisfactor}'  results.  He  searched  the  records 
of  the  Heraldrj'  Office,  of  the  British  Museum  Librar}^,  of  Strat- 
ford-on-Avon,  Shakespeare's  old  home,  hoping  to  find  in  some 
one  of  these  places  a  record  of  birth,  baptism,  marriage  or  death 
that  would  settle  the  question  of  William  Beardsley's  ancestors; 
but  not  a  single  trace  was  found  an5'where  here. 

He  then  went  to  3t.  Alban's,  Hertfordshire,  where  William 
probably  lived  jxist  before  starting  for  America,  and  found  the 
following-  record : 

"Thomas  Berdslej*  and  Jane  Upton,  married  JUI3'  16, 1581.' 

CHILDREN   BY   JANE. 

1.  Agnes;  baptized  December  17,  1581. 

2.  Hugh  ;  baptized  October  31,  1582. 

3.  Elizabeth  ;  baptized  August  16, 1584. 

4.  Margaret  ;  baptized  April  1,  1587. 

5.  Jane  ;  baptized  Janixary  1,  1588-9.

One  child  by  this  Jane. 

8.  Agnes  ;  baptized  July  22,  1599.

"Bni-ials. — Maro-aret  Berdsle3',  daughter  of  Tliomas,  1587, 
October  2.  John  Berdsle}',  son  of  Thomas,  1597-8,  January  15. 
Thomas  Beardslej%  March  19,  1600." 

The  "Abbe^"  where  the  above  records  are  found  is  a  very  old 
cathedral  whose  historj'  reaches  back  to  near  the  12th  century. 
Here  possiblj'  are  a  portion  of  the  records  necessary  in  solving^ 
these  questions.  The  complete  record  is  yet  to  be  discovered. 
Just  out  of  St.  Alban's  are  several  parishes  which  we  visited,  hop- 
ino-  to  find  some  definite  trace  of  this  William's  ancestrj^  With 
a  guide  we  tramped  most  of  one  day,  and  examined  all  the  old 
church  records  made  previous  to  the  time  that  William  left  Eng- 
land ;  but  found  nothing.  Xo  doubt  the  record  is  somewhere; 
but  where?  That  found,  we  would  know  who  his  "Mar}''  was  and 
the  date  of  their  marriage      Some  one  of  the  name  may  3^et  find  it. 

After  careful  consideration,  using  all  the  information  in  his 
possession,  the  author  has  reached  the  conclusion  that  "William," 
born  1605,  and  "Thomas,"  born  1603,  where  the  sons  of  this  "Hugh," 
whose  baptismal  record  was  made  at  "St.  Alban's"  in  1582.  In 
this  family  of  the  St.  Alban's  "Thomas"  is  to  be  found,  in  all 
probabilit}^  the  ancestrj'  of  the  Beardsle)'^  famil}',  settling  in 
America  in  1635. 


.   II.— THOMAS,  THE  PROBABLE  BROTHER  OF 
WILLIAM  BEARDSLEY. 

The  family  histories  do  not  clearU*  define  the  relation  of  this 
member  of  the  family.  In  fact,  much  difference  of  o])inion  has 
existed  regarding  his  relationship. 

This  Thomas  was  born  March  0,  1603,  in  England,  and  was  a 
planter  in  Milford  in  1647. 

He  was  married,  and  afterwards  died  in  Fairfield,  1656,  and 
was  probabl}'  an  older  brother  of  William. 

His  will  contained  the  first  Beardsle3'  name  recorded  in  Fair- 
field Count}^,  and  is  nearly  destro5^ed  by  the  action  of  the  ink  cor- 
roding the  paper  on  which  it  was  written.  His  estate  was  small, 
consisting  of  a  house-lot,  two  houses,  and  a  few  other  things. 
The  name  of  "Johannah  Beardsley"  is  mentioned  in  such  a  way 
as  to  leave  the  impression  that  she  was  his  widow,  of  which  there 
is  scarcely  any  doubt. 

His  estate  was  appraised  1)}'  Aiithon)'  Wilson,  HanViey  Hide, 


396  APPENDIX. 

and  Alexander  Knowls,  Jnl.v  5,  1650.  He  probably  li;id  several 
sons  and  daujihters.  whose  relationsliips  also  have  not  always 
been  correftl}'  ^iven  in  the  liistor}-  of  the  limes. 

The  "Thomas,"'  wlio  resided  in  Stratford,  was  probably  a  son 
of  his,  for  on  Febrnary  7,  1661,  he  had  lands  recorded  in  his  name, 
in  Stratford,  as  follows  : 

"House  and  honse  lott  and  lands  to  it,  ten  acres  more 
or  less,  with  Widow  Benit  north,  Mr.  Sherman  sonth.  the 
highwa}-  east,  the  swamp  west.'  Also  on  "Nov.  2,i,  1661, 
Richard  Cowls  bought  property  of  Thomas  Beardsley  " 

The  record  describes  the  following-  pieces  of  land  as  owned  by 

him  : 

"Three  acres  in  the  New-field,  being  on  Carman's  Neck, 
bounded  with  the  highway  east,  the  creek  ^vest,  Caleb 
Nichols  north,  and  John  Peacock  south."  Al^^o,  "Five 
acres  of  meadow  in  Great  Meadow."  "Two  acres  at  wood 
end  of  meadow."  "Four  acres  in  New-field  on  Stony 
Brook." 

On  the  same  date  as  above  this  entrj'  was  made: 

"Thomas  Beardsle}',  of  Stratford,  exchanged  with 
Hugh  Griffin  four  acres  of  land  in  the  New-field  with  all 
ye  appurtenances,  which  said  upland  is  a  part  of  twent}^ 
acres  b3'  the  fence  upon  Ston^-  Brook." 

Februar}^  13, 1668,  it  is  stated  that : 

"Thomas  Beardslej',  deceased,  hath  five  ^^  «cres  l5'ing- 
in  the  New  field  on  je  near  side  of  Nessingpaws  Creek, 
south  with  highwa5^  west  Mrs.  David  Mitchell."  (B.  1,  87, 
Fairfield  Probate  Rec.) 

This  "Thomas"  died  February  13, 1668. 

The  inventorjr  of  his  estate,  amounting-  to  £78  5s.,  was  reported 
March  29,  1668,  by  the  selectmen,  John  Curtis,  Henr^'  Wakele3-, 
John  Pichett,  Thomas  Ufford,  and  John  Wells.  No  heirs  are  men- 
tioned, jet  he  certainly  left  a  widow,  "Fllizabeth." 

Entries  in  the  old  Brand  Book  of  Stratford,  1640-1720.  page  23, 
read  as  follows  : 

"Goodman  Daiton,  of  Long  Island,"  has  the  care  and 
use  of  some  horses  for  "widow  Fllizabeth  Beardsle}',  or 
good  wife  Daiton,  for  her  children.  Ye  26th  Februarj',  1669, 
hath  a  sorrel  mare  colt,  year  old  this  spring,  with  a 
streaked  hoof,  sorrel   mane  and  tayle.      For   ye   children 


APPENDIX.  :«&gt;7 

afoix'said   a   kinde   of   a  dimnisli  black  liorse   colt   a   jear 
old  thit?  spring."     (Histoo'  of  Stratford,  132.) 

The  widow,  it  appears,  had  married  "the  goodnian  Daiton,  of 
Long-  Island."  As  Samuel  Daiton  appears  in  Brookhaven,  with 
Elizabeth  his  wife,  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  he  cliang-ed  his 
residence  between  Connecticut  and  Long  Island.  He  was  in  1641 
in  Long  Island,  in  1656  at  New^  Haven  ;  .soon  again  at  Brookhaven, 
Long-  Island. 

The  following  record  is  on  an  old  tombstone  in  a  g^raveyard 
in  Old  Stratford:  "John  Beardslej',  died  November  7,  1702,  aged 
52,"  which  would  make  his  birth  1650,  and  hence  he  must  have 
been  a  son  of  Thomas  Beardslej',  Sen.  Of  this  "John"  I  have 
found  no  other  record. 

There  was  also  a  "William  Beardsley"  of  Fairfield,  whose  will 
bears  date  of  July  6,  1660.  He  was  probably  another  son  of  the 
first  Thomas.  The  record  is  dim  and  the  volume  has  been  much 
damaged  b}'  the  ink  corroding  the  paper.  The  following  is  about 
all  that  can  be  made  out.  He  gives  to  each  of  his  daughters  "ten 
pounds,"  and  to  his  "onlj^  son,  Samuel,  the  cow  I  lent  him."  Also 
to  his  "wife'  sundry  amounts.  Her  name  is  not  given,  neither  are 
those  of  his  daughters,  and  this  is  the  only  record  found  anj'- 
where  of  that  "Samuel"  or  of  his  family.  (P.  Rec.  Fairfield, 
Vol.L) 

"Deborah,"  who  was  brought  up  b}'  Captain  John  Beardslej', 
and  married  Alexander  Fairchild,  is  believed  to  have  been  a 
daughter  of  this  Thomas  Beardsley.  Capt.  John  left  to  her,  and 
to  her  son,  John  Fairchild,  quite  a  fortune.  (History  of  Stratford, 
1130-2.) 

Joseph  Beardsle}',  of  Brookhaven,  Long  Island,  must  also 
have  been  another  son  of  the  first  Thomas.  He,  July -4,  1681,  con- 
veyed divers  tracts  of  land  in  Stratford,  Conn.,  which  no  doubt 
had  fallen  to  him  hy  heirship,  to  Andrew  Gibbs,  a  merchant  of 
the  same  place,  who,  on  the  above  date,  convej^ed  to  Joseph 
Beardslej',  "3'eoman,"  lands  and  meadows  in  Brookhaven. 

In  December,  1681,  Joseph  Beardsley  died,  and  his  estate  was 
divided  between  Abraham  Dayton  and  Mar}',  his  wife,  and  Rich- 
ard Huke  and  Hannah,  his  wife.  From  which  it  seems  that  these 
two  women  were  his  only  heirs,  probabl}'  his  sisters,  for  on  Oct. 
16,  1686,  they  submitted  to  the  court  a  document,  showing  that 
thei'  were  "co-heirs"  to  the  estate  of  Joseph  Beardsley,  and  they 
were  admitted  as  joint  administrators  of  the  same. 


398  APPENDIX. 

III.— OTHER  BEARDSLEYS  NOT  DESCENDANTS 

OF  WILLIAM. 

The  Author  has  thus  far  found  but  two  families  of  the  name, 
who  were  not  descendants  of  William  Beardsley,  namely:  One,  of 
which,  the  father,  came  froui  Shottleji:ate,  Derbyshire,  England, 
in  1842.  and  his  family"  in  1848.  His  sons  were  Joseph,  Williain, 
Isaac,  Charles,  Henry,  Samuel.  The  father  of  this  family  died  in 
Iowa  in  1854. 

William,  of  this  family,  born  December  1,  1831,  was  twice  mar- 
ried and  had  eight  children.     Res.  Pittsburgh,  Pa. 

In  1885  the  Author  heard  of  a  Beardslej'  connected  with  the 
railroad  at  Pocatello,  Idaho.  LTpon  communicating  with  him  he 
replied:  "I  am  not  of  your  family.  Not  long-  since  I  came  from 
England." 

There  may  be  other  families  who  have  come  to  America  in 
recent  years,  but  I  have  not  discovered  them. 

The  study  of  these  ancestral  histories  has  been  attended  with 
deep  interest  to  the  Author,  and  has,  as  well,  been  one  of  love  : 
Love  for  the  name  and  for  that  One,  through  whose  assistance 
and  gracious  favor  these  honorable  histories  have  been  made, 
has  been  greatlj'  increased.  The  name  we  are  sure  merits  the 
mead  of  praise  given,  in  quotation,  in  the  first  of  this  book.  God, 
we  are  sure,  has  made  this  a  possibility  to  each  and  all. 

In  concluding,  the  author  greatly  regrets  that  the  histories 
of  a  few^  families  came  to  late  for  classification  and  insertion,  as 
the  work  was  nearly  through  the  press  when  these  came.  Also 
that  it  was  found  necessary  to  abbreviate  very  much  in  man}'  of 
the  biographical  sketches  furnished  b^'  the  friends  of  departed 
ones  whose  history  is  embodied  in  this  work.  He  has  done  the 
best  he  could,  and  asks  only  charitable  judgment  upon  his 
labors. 


IV.— FINAL  WORD. 

There  comes  a  time  in  the  life  of  every  man  and  woman  when 
he,  or  she,  stands  between  two  Avorlds,  looking  back  upon  the  one 
and  forward  to  the  other.  Many  of  us  are  now  standing  on  that 
border  land : 

"Only  waiting  till  the  shadows 
Are  a  little  longer  grown. 


APPENDIX.  •  399 

Only  waitino-  till  the  gliniiner 

Of  the  daj^'s  last  beam  is  flown  ; 
Till  the  stars  of  heaven  are  breaking 

Throui&gt;h  the  twilight  soft  and  gray. 

(^nlN   waiting  till  the  angels 

Open  wide  the  mystic  gate, 
Even  now  I  hear  the  footsteps, 

And  sweet  voices  far  away  ; 
If  the}'  call  me  I  am  waiting, 

Onl}"  waiting  to  obe}." 

Happ3'  are  they  who  can,  from  the  heart,  join  in   tlie  assur- 
ance : 

"M3'  father  is  rich  in  houses  and  lands. 
He  holdeth  the  wealth  of  the  world  in  his  hands. 
Of  rubies  and  diamonds,  of  silver  and  gold, 
His  coffers  are  full,  he  has  riches  untold. 

&gt;I}'  Father's  own  Son,  the  Saviour  of  men. 

Once  wandered  o'er  Earth  as  the  poorest  of  men. 

But  now  he's  exalted  in  glor}'  on  high 

And  he'll  give  us  a  liome  in  heaven  bj'  and  by. 

I  once  was  an  outcast  stranger  on  Earth, 
A  sinner  b}'  choice  and  an  alien  by  birth. 
But  I've  been  adopted,  my  name's  written  down, 
I'm  an  heir  to  a  mansion,  a  robe  and  a  crown. 

A  tent  or  a  cottage — why  should  I  care — 
He's  building  a  palace  for  me  over  there, 
And  though  I'm  an  exile  yet  still  I  can  sing, 
All  glory  to  God  !  I'm  a  child  of  a  King." 

Let  the  acclaim  go  forth  from  ever}'  saved  soul  : 

"I'll  praise  n\y  Maker  while  I've  breath. 
And  when  mj-  voice  is  lost  in  death 

Praise  shall  eniplo}'  my  nobler  powers  ; 
My  days  of  praise  shall  ne'er  be  past, 
While  life,  and  thought,  and  being  last, 

And  iinniortalit}-  endures."
