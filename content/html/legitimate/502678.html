In the late 1970s, he turned  perhaps inspired by the new rise of Modernism  to a more chromatic idiom, though without abandoning his roots. His most significant work in this experimental period was <i>Komposition för orgel och symfonisk blåsorkester</i> (Composition for organ and concert band, 1983).  After a transition period of a few years, Karlsson arrived at his current style in the early 1990s. This can be seen as a sort of mature return to his early ideals, beginning with the intensely  melodic and technically challenging Violin Concerto (1991/93), whose Romantically tinted Neo-Classicism recalls Prokofiev. The Violin Concerto was also Karlsson's first work in a traditional genre; it was later followed by the powerful Bartók-like String Quartet (1997) and the First Symphony (1999)</td></tr>

Kostiainen's music is usually free-tonal, but his idiom extends further both ways, both towards pure tonality and towards more contemporary vocal techniques. For example, in one of his best-known works, <i>Jaakobin pojat</i> (Jacob's Sons, 1976), the Biblical list of names is presented using Sprechgesang, whispers, glissandos, highest and lowest possible notes of undetermined pitch, and a spatial element</td></tr>

Bacewicz Elementary Music School in Warsaw. From 1980 to 1986 she studied composition with Wlodzimierz Kotonski at the Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw. From 1986-1988 she did her post-graduate work in composition with Louis Andriessen, at the Royal Conservatory of Music in The Hague. She participated in the International Courses for Young Composers organized by the Polish Section of the ISCM, and the International Summer Courses of New Music at Darmstadt. The year 1985 was very important for her career: her composition for symphony orchestra, <i>Ad Unum</i>, received second prize at the European Young Composers' Competition, organized in Amsterdam by the European Cultural Foundation to celebrate the continent's unity. The theme of her work, a dissonant, dramatic and well-crafted study of convergence towards musical unity, was eminently suitable for this occasion. The same piece by the 24-year old composer, performed at the Warsaw Autumn Festival, elicited an enthusiastic response from Jan Weber, a very powerful music critic who warned Kulenty's male colleagues: "Gentlemen, hear and tremble!"</td></tr>

target="_blank">more...</a></td><td>7 Jul. 1883<br>Finland</td><td>18 May 1918</td><td>popular composer of vocal music. He is frequently described as the 'tragic Romantic in Finnish music', chiefly because of his violent death in a shooting incident at the early age of 35. Kuula went on study trips to Italy, Germany and France and developed an interest in the Impressionism of Debussy. There are fleeting touches of Impressionism in his music, for example in the orchestral pieces <i>Metsässä sataa</i> (Raining in the Forest, 1912) and <i>Hiidet virvoja viritti</i> (The Will-o'-wisp, 1912), but for the most part his style is a flowing, nationally tinted brand of Romanticism.  
Kuula was also an active collector of folk music and occasionally used folk tunes in his works. Kuula made his breakthrough with two
extensive and tempestuous chamber music works, the Violin Sonata in E minor (1907) and the Piano Trio in A major (1908).  Earlier, he had written a few solo songs  <i>Syystunnelma</i> (Autumn Mood, 1904) and <i>Aamulaulu</i> (Morning song, 1905)  that have since become classics</td></tr>
