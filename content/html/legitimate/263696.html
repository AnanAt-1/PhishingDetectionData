<p align=left>XRosyGUI is 16- and 32-bit OCX/ActiveX controls for developing versatile, intuitive and 
great-looking GUIs. </p>
<p align=left>You want good GUIs, but you also know they require a huge amount of skilled C++ programming 
effort. That is why you are looking for an easy ActiveX tool. But have you ever thought about what 
would be a superb GUI tool? XRosyGUI gives you a unique answer: <u>a tool allowing you to 
simulate any interactive scenes containing any objects, which in turn can have unlimited descendant 
scenes and objects</u>. </p>
<p align=left>An XRosyGUI scene can be any things --- e.g. an office, a shopping center, an instrument control 
panel, or a beautiful virtual world full of on-screen renderings of objects casting accurate shadows 
--- only imagination is the limit. Conventional windows GUI elements, such as buttons, 
checkboxes, menu bars and toolbars etc., are just special cases of XRosyGUI scenes or objects.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI can simulate any interactive scenes and processes</strong></font> - XRosyGUI 
supports unlimited scene/object trees, and flexible grouping of scenes and objects. Scenes and 
objects can have nested descendant scenes and objects. There is no limit on this descendant level 
depth. Clicking on an object in a scene will automatically display or hide some objects or scenes; 
or trigger an event for you to handle.</p>
<p align=left>A real-life example of accessing objects embedded in a house may assist you in getting a sense of 
XRosyGUI&#146;s simulating power: when you click on the house&#146;s kitchen window, you can display the 
kitchen containing different objects such as oven, dish washer and refrigerator; when you click on 
the refrigerator, you can display a variety of fruit like apple, banana, and orange; when you click on 
the home theater room window of the house, you can hide the kitchen as well as its embedded 
objects, while displaying the home theater room containing an array of home entertainment devices 
like TV, VCR and remote control that are fully functional and ready for operation. The pictures 
below illustrate this process.</p>
<p align=center><img src="embed.gif" align=bottom width=515 height=214></p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI can simulate any objects</strong></font><strong> </strong>- The looks, shapes and behaviors of XRosyGUI 
objects are completely controlled by user bitmaps. As a result, you can simulate any imaginary or 
real-life objects, such as airplanes, TVs, VCRs and instrument devices with operational embedded 
buttons, LED lights, meters, and switches etc.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI can simulate many real-life looking meters</strong></font> - XRosyGUI treats 
meters as objects with rotating or sliding pointers. This allows you to simulate a variety of 
monitoring devices, depending on the bitmaps you supply to the metering objects. For instance, if 
you provide a speedometer bitmap, you get a functional speedometer. XRosyGUI supports sliders, 
meters, gauge bars, and knobs. XRosyGUI can even automatically keep track of current readings 
for hidden meters, and will display the correct values when later you expose them. The following 
pictures show examples of XRosyGUI metering objects.</p>
<p align=center><img src="metering.gif" align=bottom width=466 height=109></p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI provides many useful supplementary functions</strong></font><strong> </strong>- In addition to 
support for flying-mouse highlight on the hotspot area when the mouse moves over the object, 
XRosyGUI also offers other built-in functions for bringing attention to an object such as label, 
tooltip, and statusbar. Other useful built-in functions include stationary and mobile animation, 
movable objects, and adjustable object attributes etc.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI supports scripting</strong></font> - XRosyGUI supports scripting for its properties and 
methods. You will find this feature very useful both for your application development and for your 
application customization by your customer.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI provides many immediate useful results</strong></font> - Since XRosyGUI can 
simulate any scenes and objects, many useful features are natural results of the product 
implementation. Some examples are: any kinds of HotMaps, Toolbars, and switches. Below are 
just two examples for XRosyGUI's unlimited toolbars.</p>
<p align=center><img src="toolbar1.gif" align=bottom width=207 height=48> Internet Explorer 3.0 Toolbar</p>
<p align=center><img src="toolbar2.gif" align=bottom width=200 height=30> Nested Toolbars (saving screen space)</p>
<p align=left>Creating great-looking GUIs is also a natural XRosyGUI result. If you supply objects with 
eye-catching bitmaps, e.g. 3D ray-traced bitmaps with photo-realistic renderings/textures/shadows, 
you can really make your application look slick and dazzling. </p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI offers a 3D Ray-traced button library and tool program</strong></font> 
-XRosyGUI also provides a library of good-looking 3D Ray-traced bitmap buttons of a variety of 
shapes and textures including but not limited to metal, marble, plastic and wood, ready for inclusion 
into your application. The following shows example buttons of the library.</p>
<p align=center><img src="textures.gif" align=bottom width=341 height=44></p>
<p align=left>In addition, XRosyGUI also provides a tool program for you to quickly create your own bitmap 
frames for buttons or objects. The illustration below shows an example of creating frames for a 
three-state push button from a CD player picture. Frames for all other buttons, knobs and switches 
on the CD player can be created in the same way.</p>
<p align=center><img src="frames.gif" align=bottom width=328 height=134></p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI saves screen space</strong></font> - Remarkably, XRosyGUI allows you to show many 
different scenes and objects within a common screen area. This is because XRosyGUI supports 
automatic display and hiding of mutually exclusive nested scenes and objects.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI enhances conventional windows GUI elements</strong></font> - Conventional 
windows GUI elements, such as command buttons, checkboxes, frames, option buttons, ribbon 
buttons, labels, statusbars, tooltips, panels, menu bars and toolbars, are just special cases of 
XRosyGUI scenes and objects --- except XRosyGUI does them better. XRosyGUI can give these 
elements a complete face-lift, making them look as attractive as you want.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI perfectly integrates with other controls</strong></font> - XRosyGUI can be used 
together with other controls such as Grid control, TextBox, and ListBox. You can place one or 
multiple XRosyGUI controls and other controls on the same forms. XRosyGUI scenes and objects 
embrace other controls to give your application a special look and feel. The example below uses 
one XRosyGUI control and multiple other controls on the same form.</p>
<p align=center><img src="form2.gif" align=bottom width=326 height=264></p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>XRosyGUI makes your imagination reality</strong></font><strong> </strong>- XRosyGUI allows you to completely 
control the look and feel of your application by using your own bitmaps. If you can imagine a 
visually cool application, XRosyGUI makes it reality.</p>
