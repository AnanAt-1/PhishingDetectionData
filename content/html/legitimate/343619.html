<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
turns and looks at Gabrielle. &quot;He's insane! He wants me to kill him!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
throws <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> back, landing hard on his <span

him. He stumbles over his own feet and falls back to the ground. He attempts to
scurry away from her on his hands <span class=GramE>and</span> feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;If
we lose your challenge <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>, I will kill you myself!
I will torment you in <span class=SpellE>Tartarus</span> for all of time!&quot;
With that she spins around and heads off towards the royal hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
helps <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> to his feet and then touches his forearm.
&quot;<span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>, will you go find <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>,
and tell her to meet me in my hut in a <span class=SpellE>candlemark</span>?
Please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <span
class=SpellE>Joxer</span> heads off toward the practice grounds to find <span
class=SpellE>Ephany</span>. <span class=GramE>His hands rubbing over his tender
behind.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
sighs, &quot;Oh Artemis, please help me get through this. Please help Xena calm
down before she sheds <span class=SpellE>Joxer's</span> blood.&quot; Gabrielle
walks toward the hut to talk to Xena.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>She
moves the cloth covering the doorway aside and peers into the room. Xena is
standing in the center of the hut, her fists clenched at her sides. &quot;Damn
him to <span class=SpellE>Tartarus</span>.&quot; Xena continues to mumble
curses and phrases that cause the bard to blush slightly. Gabrielle enters the
hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Xe</span>, we need to talk about this.&quot; Gabrielle slowly
approaches the warrior, knowing all too well her anger and darkness, and how
hard she is fighting the demon to prevent her from ripping <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>
limb from limb at this very moment. Gabrielle walks to the sleeping pallet and
sits down on the edge. She is waiting for Xena to calm down enough to talk. Her
<span class=GramE>legs gently swings</span> back and forth atop her other knee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
continues to pace the floor and mutter to herself. After about a quarter of a <span
class=SpellE>candlemark</span>, she comes to the pallet and kneels before the
bard. Taking Gabrielle's hand in her own, she looks into the eyes of her
beloved. &quot;Are you sure you want to agree to this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
we have no choice. <span class=GramE>Its</span> between <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>
and Ares, and we are just the pawns. I will ask <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>
to be our third.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;But
Gabrielle, she is your Regent...&quot; <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> voice
drops off as she questions Gabrielle's choice, not because she doesn't want <span
class=SpellE>Ephany</span> on her side, but what if they lose. She shudders at
the thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
I know what you mean.&quot; Gabrielle squeezes <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
hand. &quot;I trust her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It
is said with such honesty and conviction, Xena can not argue. She knows that
the team must be made up of women they can trust, in case things turn ugly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yes,
<span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> it is. <span class=GramE>Who else my
bard?&quot;</span> Xena strokes the bard's hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
ponders for a moment. &quot;Diana?&quot; Gabrielle gently spreads her legs, and
Xena takes up residence between them hugging the bard while they talk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
shakes her head. &quot;No, not her style, we do not need a harp player.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Meg?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
shakes her head again, &quot;she is experienced with boulders, but not exactly
the kind of 'player' we need.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
how about <span class=SpellE>Minya</span>? She does still owe you a favor for
dumping <span class=SpellE>Hower</span> when he was drooling all over
you.&quot; Gabrielle <span class=GramE>give</span> Xena a wicked grin and winks
at her. &quot;After all, I did have to explain to him his wasn't exactly 'your'
type.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yes,
my bard, you did. But as I recall, you also thought I should change my armor to
chain-mail and attract a kinkier type.&quot; She returns the wicked grin.
&quot;And, I did that without the chain-mail.&quot; She kisses the bards nose
playfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
calls out to one of the two royal guards posted outside the hut. &quot;Could
you please send a messenger to me?&quot; She smiles at the guard, who quickly
bows and withdrawals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
joins Gabrielle on the pallet, where they sit and discuss their strategy until
the messenger arrives. Gabrielle goes to the small table and quickly writes a
message to <span class=SpellE>Minya</span> on a scroll:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Minya</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, your presence is required immediately in <st1:place
w:st="on">Amazonia</st1:place>, a matter of life or death. Gabrielle<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>PS
Bring your whip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>She
hands the scroll to the messenger with clear instructions that it is to be
given only to <span class=SpellE>Minya</span>, and that she has one week in
which to return. The <span class=GramE>messenger quickly leave</span> with her
entrusted message, breaking into a run as soon as she clears the doorway of the
hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Ephany</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> sees a messenger running out of
the village as she approaches the royal hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Ephany</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> stands outside the hut and calls
to the Queen as protocol demands. &quot;Queen Gabrielle? You sent for me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Please
come in, <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>.&quot; Gabrielle replies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Ephany</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> enters the dark hut to find
Gabrielle on her knees on the pallet behind Xena, rubbing the knots from her
shoulders. <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> kneels and bows her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Ephany</span>, please, we are alone, you need not kneel before me,
<span class=GramE>we</span> are friends.&quot; Gabrielle leaves Xena and the
pallet to stand before <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>. A hurt look crosses <span
class=SpellE>Xena's</span> face at the loss of her bard's warm hands and touch,
the emptiness felt as soon as the bard's hands stop touching her skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Ephany</span>, we need to talk.&quot; The seriousness in
Gabrielle's voice warns the Regent of the danger of this conversation.
&quot;Please take a walk with me. I will explain everything.&quot; The Regent
shakes her head slowly &quot;yes&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
turns to find Xena standing behind her within arms reach. She smiles up at
Xena, &quot;I will be back soon, love.&quot; She stands on her toes and gently
kisses <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> lips. Xena draws her quickly into a
hug, and kisses her deeply. <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> turns toward the
doorway to give the two a bit of privacy. She knows how protective and private
Xena is. The lovers break from the kiss, both gasping for breath. &quot;Soon,
or I will come looking for you.&quot; Xena looks at <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>
and winks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
gently takes <span class=SpellE>Ephany's</span> arm and they leave the hut,
entering the afternoon sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
continues to pace around the hut for a few moments, and then heads to the
stables for Argo. She quickly saddles Argo and leads her out of the stable. She
vaults onto Argo's back and heels the mare into a run toward the forest. After
both have worked up a sweat and are breathing hard, Xena pulls Argo to a stop
and somersaults off of her back landing in front of a fallen tree. She draws
her sword, and cursing <span class=SpellE>Joxer's</span> name she proceeds to
whittle the log into kindling. Exhausted she falls to her knees before the pile
resembling tooth-picks and prays to the Goddess Artemis. &quot;Please, great
Goddess of the Amazons, look over and protect Gabrielle if I fail in my
quest.&quot; She begins to silently cry at all that might be lost because of
the 'Mighty <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Soon
she recovers from her workout and <span class=GramE>emotions,</span> she stands
and sheathes her sword. Her muscles tired and worn she walks over to grab
Argo's reins. She pats Argo's neck, finding the mare covered in lather from the
run. &quot;I'm sorry girl.&quot; Xena leads Argo back toward the village and
the stables. Once in the stables Xena brushes and grooms Argo while she tells
Argo of her current problem with Gabrielle, and <span class=SpellE>Joxer's</span>
bet with the God of War. When Argo is done, her coat is shining, and the knots
in her mane brushed out, Xena gives her an apple as a treat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
leaves the stables, feeling much more relaxed and able to handle the problem <span
class=SpellE>Joxer</span> has brought upon her and Gabrielle. She returns to
the royal hut to find Gabrielle waiting for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle smiles.</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> &quot;How was your time with
Argo?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Good,
we had a great run.&quot; Xena walks over to the water basin to wash up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
approaches from behind, sliding her hands around her warrior, she hugs her,
smelling the leather, Argo, and a smell all <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
sighs and leans against Gabrielle. &quot;Give me a few moments to wash
up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I'm
comfortable,&quot; Gabrielle sighs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Gabrielle,
what did <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> say?&quot; Xena continues to wash off
her arms and face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
sighs and squeezes Xena tighter. &quot;She said yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
turns within Gabrielle's grasp. She hugs her tightly against her. Gabrielle
draws back slightly at the minor pain <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> armor
inflicts on her almost bare chest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
pulls away and glances down at the small indentation her armor made just above
Gabrielle's naval. She drops to her knees before the bard and kisses the
indentation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
sighs and leans against <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> face. She rubs her
soft hands across her warrior's shoulders. She massages the knots she feels
under her fingertips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
continues to lavish kisses and licks on the indentation and Gabrielle's naval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Soon
Gabrielle is moaning and pressing against <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
face. She gently presses down on <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> shoulders,
urging her lover lower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
slowly licks back and forth across the top of Gabrielle's belt. She leans back
and looks up into the face of her bard. &quot;Sweetness, lift your skirt for
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
drops her hands for the shoulders of her lover, and grasping her skirt with
both hands, she begins slowly lifting it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
leans back slightly away from the bard to watch. <span class=GramE>Holding her
breath as the bard's curly blonde hairs begin to show.</span> She moans at the
sight of the bard's sex. She can see the hairs along the edge glistening with
wetness. She tears her eyes away from the glorious sight before her, and looks
up at the bard's eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
smiles down at Xena and purrs, &quot;Xena, what are you waiting for? <span
class=GramE>A hand-written scroll?</span> <span class=GramE>A command?&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
bows her head, &quot;Your wish, is my command, my Queen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
steps back from Xena. She slowly unties her belt, letting her skirt drop to the
floor around her ankles. She steps behind Xena and kneels. Using her belt, she
binds the warrior's hands together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
keeps her head down. A low guttural moan escapes her lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
stands and steps about two paces in front of the kneeling warrior. &quot;Xena,
crawl to me and prove your willingness to serve.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Without
lifting her head, judging where Gabrielle is by sound alone, Xena slowly crawls
across the floor on her knees. She stops just has her knees touch Gabrielle's
boots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
what do you desire from serving me?&quot; Gabrielle inquires in a husky voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;To
prove I would do anything for you and receive pleasure from touching your
beautiful body, my Queen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Xena's</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> body begins to shake slightly with
the desire she feels for Gabrielle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
can see the effect she is having on Xena. She runs her fingers through her
warrior dark hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Hmmm,
you feel so good, <span class=SpellE>Xenaaa</span>.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
continues to shake with her need for the bard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
runs a fingertip over the warrior's bottom lip. <span class=GramE>So soft, so
moist.</span> <span class=GramE>&quot;Xena?&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yes,
my Queen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Suck
my finger.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
draws Gabrielle's finger into her mouth. Slowly running her tongue up and down
the <span class=GramE>bards</span> finger. <span class=GramE>Gently biting the
tip.</span> She runs her tongue around the finger starting at the base and
working her way to the tip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A
moan escapes the bard's lip. <span class=GramE>&quot;<span class=SpellE>Mmm</span>,
<span class=SpellE>yesss</span>.&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
continues to savor the taste of her bard's finger. Giving all of <span
class=GramE>herself</span> to providing the bard with pleasure from this simple
act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
changes fingers, and allows the warrior to taste each one. When her last finger
has been thoroughly licked, she slides her thumb into <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
mouth. She continues to pull her thumb in and out, feeling <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
tongue caress it. The <span class=GramE>feelings that both women were experiencing
continues</span> to draw moans from each one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
could no longer take it. She can feel her own wetness on her thigh. <span
class=GramE>&quot;Enough, my warrior.&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
steps to a nearby chair and sits down. <span class=GramE>&quot;Xena?&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Yes,
my Queen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Come
to me.&quot; Xena <span class=GramE>crawls</span> the few steps to where
Gabrielle is seated. Gabrielle caresses her cheek. Gabrielle spreads her legs
to give Xena a better view of her wetness. &quot;Xena, I am in need of your
tongue. <span class=GramE>Now.&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
leans forward to run her tongue down the length of Gabrielle's sex. <span
class=GramE>Tasting the bard's sweet ambrosia.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
slides her tongue inside the bard, drawing more of Gabrielle's wetness into her
<span class=GramE>mouth,</span> she swallows it, craving more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
Queen grabs the back of the warrior's head, pushing her tongue deeper into her
wetness. They moan in unison. More wetness pours from the bard. Xena greedily
swallows it all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
pulls Xena up from her task, and kisses her deeply. She tastes herself on the
warrior's lips. She continues their kiss as she reaches behind the warrior to
release her bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
warrior quickly wraps her arms around the bard in a hug.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
begins unbuckling the straps on <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> armor. Piece
by piece it slowly falls to the floor while they continue kissing lips, necks,
and ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Soon
the two lovers move to the bed to continue their love making at a slower, more
loving pace until deep into the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As
instructed by <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> and with his help, over the next
week, the women clear an area near the practice field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
area contains ten rows of neatly cleared dirt, all rocks and grass removed by
hand. Each row is one pace wide and twenty paces long. At the end of each row
stand ten logs, two hands tall. Each of the logs <span class=GramE>are</span>
standing up on their ends to form a pyramid shape, ten logs in each pyramid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Joxer</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

rocks off the large rows. &quot;Well, this looks exactly like what Ares
described. We should be ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>All
the women moan in unison, and continue tossing rocks away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
yells at <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>, &quot;get back to work!&quot; Under
her breath she continues, &quot;<span class=GramE>by</span> the Gods, he is
such an idiot!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As
the day draws to a close, a feast begins in the center of the village. Three
huge bonfires burn to light up the area as the sun sets on the horizon. <span
class=SpellE>Ephany</span> and Gabrielle are standing on the ceremony stage.
Gabrielle stands on the stage in the center, wearing her Amazon Queen leathers
and feathered mask, <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> stands just a little
behind her on the right, and Xena stands a full step behind her on the left.
All the Amazons are in their battle dress and masks. Gabrielle lifts her arms
to quiet the crowd. She looks down to see <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span>
standing in front of the stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Amazons,
we are gathered tonight for a feast before tomorrow dawns and the battle
begins.&quot; She looks to all the faces watching her. &quot;We celebrate
tonight to wish our friends and family luck in tomorrow's battle. Tomorrow at
dawn it begins! Until then, let us feast and pray to the Goddess Artemis to
watch over the Amazons tomorrow.&quot; With that said, she lifts her mask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>All
of the Amazons remove their masks and begin to scream Artemis' name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
turns to <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span> and smiles. <span class=SpellE>Ephany</span>
runs and jumps off of the stage and begins to scream as well. Drums begin to
beat and the Amazons start dancing around the fires.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Joxer</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> stands near the stage and watches the women dance
around. <span class=GramE>Their bodies glowing unearthly oranges and yellows.</span>
They begin primal motions in time with the drums. He quietly walks to a food
table and draws a mug of wine. He returns to his spot near the stage drinking
his mug of Amazon wine, wondering how he could have gotten his friends in such
a serious and possibly deadly position. He turns to look at his friends on the
stage. They are standing close together, it appears to be an argument, but he
can't make out the words with the drums and screaming. He thinks about how much
he loves Gabrielle and looking at Xena knows he can never have her. He ponders
his actions that have placed her, his beloved Gabrielle, in mortal danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A
hand clamps down on <span class=SpellE>Joxer's</span> shoulder. He turns to see
the God of War standing next to him. &quot;What do you want Ares?&quot; He
timidly asks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Ares
smiles at him, &quot;Everything will be <span class=GramE>mine</span> tomorrow!
Then you can have that sniveling love-sick bard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>He
motions to Gabrielle. &quot;Your team will be on the field at dawn, you poor
excuse of a warrior.&quot; He begins to fade out. &quot;And, <span
class=SpellE>Joxer</span>.....thank you.&quot; His laughter echoes in <span
class=SpellE>Joxer's</span> ears as he vanishes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
pulls her attention away from Gabrielle for a moment to look at <span
class=SpellE>Joxer</span>. She feels the presence of Ares, but does not see
him. As quickly as the feeling came, it leaves. She looks back into her lover's
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&quot;Gabrielle, no.&quot;</span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> Xena
shakes her head again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;But
Xena, she's not here yet. Who else can we get? We have got to ask <span
class=SpellE>Ephion</span>.&quot; Gabrielle pleads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;No
Gabrielle, we will not risk any more of our friends. She will be here.&quot;
With that Xena turns and walks away from Gabrielle toward the food tables. She
pours herself a mug of wine. She empties it quickly and pours another mug. As
she empties the mug for a second time, a warm hand touches her arm. She lowers
the mug and looks into Gabrielle's eyes. She smiles, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;I
understand Xena,&quot; she smiles at her warrior, &quot;it has been a hard
week.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
sets down her mug on the table and grabs Gabrielle's hand. She gently tugs her
along and begins walking toward the royal hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
where are we going? We are in the middle of a feast.&quot; Gabrielle voices her
protest but follows Xena.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Gabrielle,
they won't even know we are gone. Come on.&quot; Xena pulls the cloth door
aside pulling Gabrielle into the hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&quot;<span class=SpellE>Xe</span>?</span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> What are
we doing?&quot; Gabrielle questions Xena.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Suddenly
Gabrielle feels Xena pull her into an embrace. &quot;Gabrielle, if this is to
be our last night together I don't want to spend it dancing around a fire with
a bunch of Amazons.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Xena,
don't even speak like that, we will win, I just know it!&quot; Gabrielle
returns the hug and places her ear against <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
chest, listening to her heart beat in time with her own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
uses a finger under Gabrielle's chin to tilt her face up. She looks into her
eyes. &quot;No matter what happens tomorrow Gabrielle, I love you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
returns the look, &quot;I love you, Xena.&quot; She stands on her toes and
kisses Xena. The kiss quickly turns more passionate. Their lips part, tongues
meet, and their moans are swallowed by each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
breaks the kiss as her calves begin to knot from standing on her toes too long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
quickly dips down and catching the bard behind the knees with one arm, the other
around her shoulders picks her up and carries her to the sleeping pallet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
wraps her arms around the warrior. Though she feels safe within <span
class=SpellE>Xena's</span> arms, she longs to feel the warrior closer. Her arms
tighten around <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> neck, fingers caressing her
hair, she gently kisses her neck. A moan escapes <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
sets Gabrielle down on the edge of the pallet. She kneels down before the bard,
to begin unlacing her boots. She removes each boot caressing her legs slowly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
bard begins untying her leather top. Xena watches carefully, holding her breath
until the bard's breasts meet the night air. <span class=GramE>Her nipples hard
in the cool breeze.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
quickly leans forward to take one in her mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
bard arches her back into the warmth of her lovers tongue and teeth. Her hands
tangle into <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> hair pulling her warrior tighter
against her breast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
pulls away for a moment to fumble with her armor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
stills her hands. &quot;Leave it on, love.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Xena
smiles knowingly at her bard. Gabrielle wants to feel <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span>
power over her. Xena unhooks her <span class=SpellE>chakram</span> and lays it
down on the floor next to the pallet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>She
leans in and taking the bard's bottom lip between her teeth gently, she pulls
on Gabrielle's hips to move her closer to the edge of the bed and against <span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle
moans as Xena presses into her wet center. She pulls her lip out from between <span
class=SpellE>Xena's</span> teeth. &quot;Take me warrior. I am yours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Soon
Gabrielle is screaming <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> name out in passion.
The noises continue to pour forth from the royal hut late into the night. <span
class=GramE>Sometimes the Queen's name, sometimes the warrior's, and
occasionally a &quot;By the Gods!&quot;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
sun rises the next morning. All of the Amazons are gathered on the field as the
darkness gives way to the grayness before the sun rises. As the sun begins
peeking over the horizon, two <span class=GramE>runners</span> streak through
the village and to the crowd. <span class=SpellE>Minya</span> shoves her way
through the crowd, coming to a stop in front of Gabrielle and Xena. Gasping for
breath, &quot;Gabrielle ...I ...got ...here as soon ...as I ...could.&quot; She
draws her whip and turns to the crowd. &quot;Are we taking all of these women
on in battle?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle

Please, we need to worry about our game.&quot; Xena knows she is avoiding the

down, and even participated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Gabrielle

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Ares
screams, &quot;NO, this was a fair game, she used a weapon, she is MINE!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Goddess helps Gabrielle to her feet. &quot;<span class=GramE>Ares, that</span>
is where the problem is. Your rules stated, 'the team that knocks down the most
logs wins. All four members from each team will go up one by one and try to
knock down the most logs.' You never stated a weapon could not be used. Nor did
you state it could be used. All assumed they must use the gathered boulders
because <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> said they needed them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

walks over to Ares, &quot;as I see it brother, Xena did follow your rules, and
the women won.&quot; She waves her hand and the three men seated on the bench
disappear. &quot;If you would like brother, we can take this up with
Father?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Ares
backhands Xena, sending her into the dirt on her backside. Gabrielle quickly

helps Xena to her feet. <span class=SpellE>Xena's</span> lip is split and

the cloth from Gabrielle and holds it to her lip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looks to the Goddess. &quot;Thank you, Artemis.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

smiles at the Queen of her Amazons. &quot;Never trust <span class=GramE>him,</span>

the crowd begins to thin, <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> approaches Xena and
Gabrielle. With his head hung down he apologizes for his ever agreeing to this
game. Xena looks at <span class=SpellE>Joxer</span> and tells him, &quot;<span
class=SpellE>Joxer</span> you can be a great warrior without the help of a God.
What you need is already inside of you. Care for those who do not or can not
care for themselves. Honor those who do not honor you. And <span class=GramE>never,
never lower your standards to be something you are not</span>.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
