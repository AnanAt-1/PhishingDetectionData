<h1>Making a Resume in LaTeX</h1>

<h2>Why LaTeX</h2>

<p>The first time I ever did a resume was in 8th grade.  That was my first
experience with the horror of mixing content and presentation--a lesson I've
never forgotten.  The problem was that if I wanted to change the font or
spacing of something, I had to change it in 50 different spots on the page to
make it match.  It was awful.</p>

<p>Microsoft Word has styles which can take care of some of this, but it's
still not my preferred solution.  Even with styles, it's hard to tell exactly
what text or spacing is in which style, it's inconvenient to switch back and
forth between different styles, and it's easy to have stray format settings in
a document without noticing them.  If you're going to do a resume in Word,
make sure you use styles, but I personally prefer using LaTeX to separate
content and presentation, since you can see exactly what's there.  For
example, to make text bold-faced in LaTeX, you do "\textbf{insert here the
bold text}".  In WYSIWYG editors ("what you see is what you get"), it can
still be hard on a monitor, especially at a lower screen resolution, to tell
whether text is bold or just a larger font size than the surrounding text.  In
LaTeX, there's no ambiguity.  Of course, even in LaTeX, it would be better to
decide why the text is bold and create an appropriately-named macro because
later you might want to put it in italics instead.</p>

<p>Eventually I got around to doing my resume in LaTeX.  I looked at a bunch of
resumes out there, and though I borrowed some elements or inspiration from
several of them (including <a
href="http://mboedick.org/code/latex_resume_tips.php">Matt Boedicker's</a>), I
ended up starting mostly from scratch.  I now have a resume that's incredibly
maintainable and tweakable.</p>

<p>LaTeX gives me beautiful output as a PDF file, which is perfect for
printing.  One potential drawback of using LaTeX is that lots of places are
looking for particular formats, such as plain text or Word files.  I figure
that if I ever end up in a situation where I'm applying for a job at such a
company, I will either use one of the many latex2xxxxx programs out there or
just look somewhere else.  I really have no desire to work at a place where
they just scan your resume for buzzwords.  But keep that in mind.</p>


<h2>The LaTeX File</h2>

<p>I ended up deciding to create a single self-contained LaTeX file.  The main
reasons against making a new style file are that it would more complex and
less tweakable.  Every resume looks different, and having everything in one
template file encourages tweaking.  I might change my mind later.</p>

<p><a href="mcnabb-res.tex">Click here for the source file</a> (I've taken my
resume and blotted out contact information).  Here is the final <a
href="mcnabb-res.pdf">PDF output</a> of the resume, created by pdflatex.</p>

<p>Note that the commands that are used are all clumped together in one
section.  If you want to tweak the look, most of what you'll to change is
in there.</p>

<p>To make a resume, just change the contact information, which is all lumped
together towards the top of the file, and then change the contents of the
resume at the bottom of the file.</p>


<h2>The Resume Commands and Environments</h2>

<p>Several custom-made commands environments are available in the file:</p>

<dl>

<dt>\begin{ressection}{Section Name}</dt>

<dd>A ressection makes a top-level section, such as Education or Experience.
Valid commands inside a ressection are resitem and resbigitem.  Valid
environments in a ressection are ressubsec and reslist.</dd>

<dt>\resitem{Sentence or two.}</dt>

<dd>A \resitem is a very simple item with a bullet.  It should only go directly
in the ressection and never in a sublist (see ressubitem).</dd>

<dt>\ressubitem{Sentence or two.}</dt>

<dd>A \ressubitem is a very simple item with a bullet.  It's for secondary
levels and should only go in a sublist of a ressection (see resitem).</dd>

<dt>\resbigitem{Name}{Location}{Title and/or date range}</dt>

<dd>A \resbigitem is a complicated item with a bullet which is ideal for a job
or university.  It's arguments are the name of the company or university,
followed by the location, and finally the job title, date range, and/or
description.</dd>

<dt>\begin{ressubsec}{Name}{Location}{Title and/or date range}</dt>

<dd>A ressubsec prints out a \resbigitem while defining a sublist that you can
put a \ressubitem in.</dd>

<dt>\begin{reslist}{List name}</dt>

<dd>A reslist defines a simple list with a title.  Within the environment are
\ressubitem's.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I've found that doing my resume this way makes things so much easier,
especially when I make changes.  If you find this useful, drop me a line.  I'd
like to hear what worked well and what you changed.  I may even post examples
of alternate resumes based on the same basic template.  Good luck.</p>
