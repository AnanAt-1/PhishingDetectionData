        Cells</h2></B>
        <P><I>Turnover of neurons in the hippocampus might help explain the 
        onset of and recovery from clinical depression</I></center>
        <P>No one knows the precise mechanism that triggers clinical depression, 
        but people have speculated about it for centuries. From the time of the 
        ancient Greeks until well into the Renaissance, philosophers and 
        scientists believed that bodily fluids called humors were responsible 
        for our moods and personality. Specifically, they thought that one 
        called black bile controlled depression. By the 17th century, 
        dualism--the separation of mind and body--was the dominant dogma. 
        Consequently, it was believed that depression, a disease of the “mind,” 
        arose from something gone awry in your physical or social environment. 
        But eventually, by the early 20th century, even Sigmund Freud--the 
        father of psychoanalysis--had come to believe that brain dysfunction 
        would ultimately explain mental illness. Today, neuroscientists know 
        that, in many cases, psychopathology arises because of dysfunctions in 
        particular brain structures or particular brain chemicals. As described 
        in this article, recent evidence suggests that clinical depression might 
        arise from the brain failing to grow new neurons in a specific area. 


        <P>Neurobiologists long believed that adult brains did not make new 
        neurons, but now we know otherwise. In the early 1960s, Joseph Altman at 
        MIT reported that new neurons were being produced in the brains of adult 
        rats. Those findings were somewhat forgotten for the next 30 years. 
        Recently, this work has been revived and advanced. Elizabeth Gould of 
        Princeton University, one of this article’s authors (Gage) and others 
        have reported the birth of new neurons--neurogenesis--in the hippocampus 
        of adult rats, monkeys and humans. This region of the brain lies beneath 
        the cortex in the temporal lobe <I>(see Figure 2)</I>--basically the 
        part of your brain behind your ear--and it appears to play a crucial 
        role in forming new memories. Preventing depression might depend in part 
        on proper control of this ongoing neurogenesis. 


        <P>Currently available antipsychotic medications usually fall short of 
        the desired therapeutic efficacy and invariably produce unwanted side 
        effects, such as dry mouth or sleep disturbances. These treatments 
        typically act by globally altering the chemical communication between 
        neurons throughout the brain. More recently, cell and molecular biology 
        have begun to exert a strong impact on our understanding and treatment 
        of mental illness. By targeting specific molecular sites in neurons, 
        these techniques can provide precise, powerful and effective means of 
        influencing brain function. One of these approaches--controlling 
        neurogenesis in the adult brain--might have a significant impact on the 
        treatment of mental illness. 


        <P>Let us first examine the current state of knowledge regarding adult 
        brain neurogenesis. Then we shall focus specifically on the role of 
        neurogenesis in chronic clinical depression. As we shall see, 
        controlling neurogenesis might also be used to treat or prevent a 
        variety of other forms of neuro- and psychopathology.

        <CENTER><B><h3>New Brain 
        Cells</h3></CENTER></B>
        <P>All of the cells in the body are derived from <I>stem 
        cells</I>--primitive cells that are formed soon after fertilization and 
        that can divide indefinitely. They can simply copy themselves, or they 
        can make a variety of differentiated cells, including blood, muscle and 
        neuron. They can also make progenitor cells, which can divide a limited 
        number of times and give rise to cell types such as neurons and glia. 
        <P>Most neurons in the mammalian brain and spinal cord are generated 
        during the pre- and perinatal periods of development. Nevertheless, 
        neurons continue to be born throughout life in the <I>olfactory 
        bulb</I>, which processes scents, and in the <I>dentate gyrus</I> of the 
        hippocampus. (Very recent evidence indicates that some additional brain 
        areas might also produce new brain cells.) These new neurons are derived 
        from progenitor cells that reside in the brain’s <I>subventricular 
        zone</I>, which lines open spaces deep in the brain called ventricles, 
        or in a layer of the hippocampus called the <I>subgranular zone</I>. The 
        existing neurons in the adult brain cannot divide. Some progenitor 
        cells, however, remain, and they can go through cell division to produce 
        two daughter neurons, or one glial cell or neuron and one progenitor 
        cell capable of further division. Apparently, in most parts of the adult 
        brain, something inhibits progenitor cells from dividing to produce new 
        neurons. No one knows exactly why neurogenesis continues in some areas 
        and not others. The olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus might require 
        constant renewal in order to process and store new information, whereas 
        other regions might need a stable population of neurons in order to 
        maintain ongoing function. Understanding the mechanisms involved in this 
        process could provide the opportunity for disinhibiting progenitor cells 
        throughout the central nervous system to allow them to produce new 
        neurons. This, of course, could have a major impact on the repair of 
        brain regions where cells have been lost for any of a variety of 
        reasons: disease, trauma, aging and so on. 


        <P>Investigators follow neurogenesis in the laboratory by treating 
        animals with tritiated-thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine. These compounds 
        get incorporated into the DNA of cells preparing to divide. Once these 
        cells begin the process of cell division, their daughter cells can be 
        identified by examination of post-mortem brain tissue. The compound 
        incorporated into cells can be visualized under the microscope with 
        autoradiographic or immunologic techniques for tritiated-thymidine or 
        bromodeoxyuridine, respectively. Investigators count the labeled cells 
        to quantify the number of proliferating and newly born cells. 


        <P>These techniques show that progenitor cells in the subgranular zone 
        produce progeny that migrate outward to the granule-cell layer and 
        differentiate into neurons. In this way, these new granule cells join 
        the population of existing neurons. These newly born cells mature in the 
        granule-cell layer and send their dendrites outward, whereas their cell 
        processes go inward and follow paths to other structures within the 
        hippocampus, such as the CA3 cell fields. Consequently, these new 
        neurons get integrated in the basic circuitry of the brain. 


        <P>The dentate gyrus produces 1,000-3,000 new neurons per day in rats 
        and mice. Although this might seem like a small number, it could 
        represent a substantial proportion of the total population over an 
        animal’s lifespan. Furthermore, these recently born neurons might serve 
        a more important role in processing new information than those in the 
        extant population of granule cells. So far, such data have not been 
        collected for primates. Some investigators believe that the magnitude of 
        neurogenesis is lower in higher mammals, but that has not been proved.

        <P><br>

<B><h3>
        <CENTER>Stress and Glucocorticoids</CENTER></h3></B>
      
        <P>Many scientists believe that stress is the most significant causal 
        agent--with the possible exception of genetic predisposition--in the 
        etiology of depression. In addition, nerve cells in the hippocampal 
        formation are among the most sensitive to the deleterious effects of 
        stress. Consequently, a stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis in the 
        hippocampus might be an important factor in precipitating episodes of 
        depression. On the other hand, increasing serotonergic neurotransmission 
        is the most effective treatment for depression, and it also augments 
        hippocampal neurogenesis. So serotonin-induced increases in neurogenesis 
        might promote recovery from depression. Considering all of this, we 
        suggest that the waning and waxing of neurogenesis in the hippocampal 
        formation might trigger the precipitation of and recovery from episodes 
        of clinical depression. 

        <P>Gould and her colleagues examined the relation between stress and 
        hippocampal neurogenesis in several species. First, they reported that 
        removing a rat’s adrenal glands increased neurogenesis in the adult 
        dentate gyrus. Moreover, they could reverse that effect with the 
        glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone, which normally comes from the 
        adrenals. The circulating level of glucocorticoids apparently suppressed 
        the birth of neurons in the dentate gyrus under normal conditions. In an 
        extension of these results, Gould’s group showed that systemic 
        administration of corticosterone to normal animals suppressed dentate 
        gyrus neurogenesis. 


        <P>This group also examined the effects of naturally stressful 
        situations. For instance, they exposed a rat to the odor of one of its 
        natural predators--a fox--and that suppressed cell proliferation in the 
        rat’s dentate gyrus. They also demonstrated reduced dentate-gyrus cell 
        proliferation in adult tree shrews after the psycho social stress of 
        exposing them to same-sex individuals. Most recently, Gould’s group 
        reported suppressed cell division in a marmoset monkey’s dentate gyrus 
        after putting it in a cage with another marmoset that had already been 
        living there. In combination, these studies show clearly that stress 
        suppresses the rate of dentate-gyrus cell proliferation in adults of a 
        number of species. Furthermore, it probably does so through increases in 
        brain glucocorticoids. 


        <P>Additional, but older, literature is also relevant here. Over the 
        past 15 years, work by Robert Sapolsky of Stanford University, Bruce 
        McEwen of Rockefeller University and others has shown, in a number of 
        species, that stress and glucocorticoids cause widespread morphological 
        changes and even cell death in parts of the hippocampus, such as in the 
        CA3 subfields. This region of the hippocampus is the main target of the 
        output of neurons in the dentate gyrus. Whether this hippocampal damage 
        is at least in part dependent on the suppression of neurogenesis in the 
        dentate gyrus is not known. 
        <P><br>
        <CENTER><B><h3>Depression and the Hippocampus</h3></CENTER></B>
        <P>Several pieces of evidence link clinical depression to changes in the 
        hippocampus. Nevertheless, we do not suggest that this is the only 
        change in the brain associated with depression, nor do we suggest that 
        alterations in the hippocampus underlie all of the phenomenological 
        aspects of depression. 


        <P>Utilizing the brain imaging technique of MRI, Yvette Sheline and her 
        colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis reported smaller 
        hippocampal volumes in a group of older women with recurrent major 
        depression. Although the subjects were in remission, they had smaller 
        left and right hippocampal volumes--but comparable total cerebral 
        volumes--in comparison with carefully selected controls. Sheline’s group 
        also found a significant negative correlation between total days of 
        depression and the volume of the left hippocampal gray matter. The 
        investigators speculate that this hippocampal loss might result from 
        glucocorticoid-induced neurotoxicity associated with recurrent episodes 
        of depression. In a more recent study, this same group confirmed their 
        original report and also showed that the decrease in hippocampal volume 
        correlated with total lifetime duration of depression and not with age. 
        Other studies confirm the relationship between depression and 
        hippocampal volume. For example, Premal Shah and his colleagues at the 
        Royal Edinburgh Hospital also reported smaller hippocampal volumes in 
        chronically depressed patients but found no decrease in hippocampal 
        volume in recovered patients. 


        <P>Temporal-lobe epilepsy also points to a connection between 
        hippocampal damage and depression. First of all, temporal-lobe epilepsy 
        involves a massive loss of cells in various structures in and around the 
        hippocampus. Second, depression is the most common psychiatric 
        complication in patients with epilepsy. Moreover, patients with 
        temporal-lobe epilepsy experience depression more than patients with 
        other forms of epilepsy or than patients with comparably debilitating 
        diseases. If there is a causal relation between temporal-lobe epilepsy 
        and depression, some evidence indicates that it might be bidirectional. 
        Because the neuropathology in temporal-lobe epilepsy encompasses most of 
        the temporal lobe, however, no definitive conclusion can be drawn 
        regarding the site of specific damage that might underlie the 
        psychopathology. <P><br>

<B><h3><center>
      Stimulation from Serotonin</center></h3></B>
 
        <P>As mentioned above, prescription drugs that increase serotonergic 
        neurotransmission are currently the most common and most effective 
        treatment for depression. Furthermore, serotonin stimulates cell 
        division in a variety of peripheral tissues and triggers neurogenesis in 
        the central nervous system during development. It also plays an 
        important role in neuronal and synaptic plasticity. That evidence made 
        serotonin worthy of further study. 


        <P>Recently, one of us (Jacobs) and his colleagues used adult rats to 
        study the effect of d,l-fenfluramine, a drug that releases serotonin 
        throughout the central nervous system. In those studies, systemic 
        administration of that drug increased cell division two- to threefold in 
        the dentate gyrus. Moreover, an antagonist for a specific serotonin 
        receptor--called 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> (serotonin is also known by the name 
        5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT for short)--completely blocked this effect 
        of d,l-fenfluramine. (Other serotonin receptors might also be involved 
        in this process.) We later showed that much of this increase in cell 
        division ended up making more neurons. So these studies highlight 
        serotonin’s impact on granule-cell neurogenesis in an adult rat’s 
        dentate gyrus. 


        <P>The clinical benefit of drugs that increase serotonergic 
        neurotransmission encouraged one of the authors (Jacobs) to test 
        fluoxetine (Prozac), which increases brain levels of circulating 
        serotonin by inhibiting it from being taken back into neurons that 
        release it. We gave adult rats a three-week, systemic treatment of 
        fluoxetine and found an approximately 70-percent increase in the number 
        of cells produced in the dentate gyrus. Ronald Duman’s group at Yale 
        University confirmed and extended that result. They found that 
        fluoxetine, antidepressants acting preferentially on norepinephrine and 
        chronic electroconvulsive shock all increased cell proliferation in a 
        rat’s dentate gyrus. 

        <P>In combination, the above studies demonstrate that serotonin can 
        dramatically augment cell proliferation and that it does so, at least in 
        part, by action at the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor. Consistent with this, 
        the hippocampus--especially the dentate gyrus--has an extremely dense 
        concentration of these receptors. 


        <P>If this receptor plays a role in depression, it would be useful to 
        test 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB>-agonist drugs as therapeutic agents. 
        Unfortunately, we lack a potent and specific 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB>-receptor 
        agonist for human use. Partial agonists for the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> 
        receptor, however, can reduce anxiety and provide some antidepressant 
        effect. To better understand this possible mechanism, we must examine 
        5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> function in depressed patients. Sharon Cheetham and 
        her colleagues at University College, London did report a decreased 
        number of 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> binding sites in the hippocampus of 
        depressed suicide victims, but they did not examine specific 
        5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> binding in the hippocampus. More recently, Stanley 
        Watson and his colleagues at the University of Michigan reported a 
        decrease in the expression of 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> mRNA in the hippocampus 
        in a group of depressed suicide victims. These findings provide 
        additional support for this receptor’s importance in controlling 
        depression. 


        <P>A final feature of this hypothesis is that it provides a conceptually 
        simple explanation for the therapeutic lag, in which antidepressant 
        treatments--both drugs and electroconvulsive therapy--typically require 
        3-6 weeks to become effective. We suggest that this is because it takes 
        time for newly born dentate-gyrus neurons to fully mature, extend their 
        neurites and integrate with the existing brain circuitry.

        <P>Despite proposing that alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis play a 
        crucial role in the etiology and recovery from depression, we do not 
        exclude other changes as being important. For example, besides 
        suppressing neurogenesis, increased glucocorticoids might mediate 
        additional direct neuronal effects in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus 
        and other subcortical areas, such as the amygdala. Similarly, changes in 
        serotonin neurotransmission might also exert direct effects in the brain 
        stem, subcortical sites and the cortex. All of these changes, acting in 
        concert, give rise to the complex syndrome of depression. 

        <P>Although this article focuses on the augmentation of dentate-gyrus 
        neurogenesis by serotonin, other means of increasing neurogenesis might 
        also have clinical relevance. For example, it is well known that 
        exercise, especially running, has an antidepressant action, and we 
        recently found that 4-10 days of running on a wheel induces a 
        significant increase in cell proliferation in a mouse’s dentate gyrus. 
        After several weeks of running, neurogenesis increased as well. Also, 
        norepinephrine appears to increase cell division in the dentate gyrus. 
        These factors might also play roles in depression. 


        <P>There are also several related theories. Pierre Blier and Claude de 
        Montigny of McGill University, for example, suggest that antidepressant 
        therapies act in the hippocampus by increasing neurotransmission at the 
        serotonin 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor and by decreasing it at the 
        beta-adrenergic receptor, which can be activated by norepinephrine. 
        Watson and his colleagues emphasize the importance of 
        glucocorticoid-induced down regulation of the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> 
        receptors in the hippocampus of experimental animals. In examining these 
        and related theories of depression, we find that our theory does not 
        supplant or contradict them. Rather, it complements and extends these 
        previous ideas by pointing to a particular neural event, the rise and 
        fall of dentate-gyrus neurogenesis. 



        <P>Still, one might wonder how the hippocampus could affect depression. 
        Historically, neurobiologists thought of it as part of the brain’s 
        cognitive circuitry and not involved in mediating mood or emotion. 
        Nevertheless, recent evidence indicates that structures considered to be 
        central to the brain’s emotional circuitry, such as the amygdala, are 
        strongly interconnected with the hippocampus. This connection would 
        provide the anatomical substrate for linking cognitive and emotional 
        information processing. Consistent with our hypothesis, clinically 
        depressed patients have a variety of memory deficits, which would also 
        point to hippocampal involvement. 


        <P>In addition to treating clinical depression, advances in controlling 
        neurogenesis might also be used to treat many other diseases where brain 
        cells have died. In this context, two separate strategies are being 
        weighed. Some investigators harvest stem cells from the adult brain, 
        expand them in tissue culture, induce the cells to make specific cell 
        lines, say neurons, and then transplant them to a specific brain region 
        where they could replace or augment endogenous cells. On the other hand, 
        cells already in the brain might be activated by pharmacological or 
        environmental stimulation and induced to proliferate and migrate to a 
        damaged or diseased brain region, where they would take up residence in 
        areas to replace or augment lost function. Although progress is being 
        made on both of these fronts, much additional work remains to make these 
        repair strategies routine. In any case, we now know that structural 
        correlates of neural plasticity extend beyond synaptic reorganization 
        and include the addition of new neurons to important circuits.
