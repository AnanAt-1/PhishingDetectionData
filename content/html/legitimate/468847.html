PEEFACE. 


^HE  evening  of  the  last  year  of  four-score  since  the  Carolina  colony  explored  the  Whitewater  country 
and  graced  its  beautiful  hills  and  valleys  with  their  cabins  is  now  closing.  More  than  three-quar- 
ters of  a  century  have  come  and  gone  since  the  Indian  trader,  Conner,  established  his  trading-post 
^p-3  on  the  banks  of  the  Whitewater,  amid  the  red  men  of  the  forest,  and  the  hunter,  Simpson,  close  by 
reared  his  cabin  near  the  stream  which  his  name  still  honors.  The  hardy  men  who  first  settled  the  lands  of 
Fayette  County  have  nearly  all  been  called  from  the  stage  of  action  and  gone  to  their  final  rest.  They 
pitched  their  tents  and  raised  the  log-cabin  where  "  nothing  appeared  but  nature  unsubdued."  "  Bold  for- 
est settlers,"  they  encountered  the  dangers  and  endured  the  privations  of  pioneer  life,  and  with  rifles  by 
their  sides,  cut  away  the  forests,  drove  back  the  wild  beasts,  and  made  the  wilderness  "  blossom  as  the 
rose,"  giving  to  those  coming  after  them  fruitful  fields.  "  Gratitude  to  the  pioneer  is  alike  honorable  to 
those  who  give  it  and  to  those  who  receive  it.  The  people  generally  appreciate  his  sacrifices,  recount  his 
deeds  and  honor  his  services.  This  gives  to  history  its  fairest  page,  and  to  simple  virtue  and  patriotism  the 
honest  commendation  they  merit." 

It  is  the  purpose  of  this  volume  to  present  to  the  present  generation,  as  well  as  to  succeeding  genera- 
tions, many  of  the  names  of  such  as  were  identified  with  the  early  and  more  recent  history  of  the  county, 
including  pioneer,  civil,  ecclesiastical,  educational,  commercial,  agricultural,  statistical  and  biographical 
matter.  The  volume  is  herewith  presented  to  our  patrons  in  a  form  which  it  is  believed  will  prove  satis- 
factory to  all,  being  in  strict  accordance  with  the  announcements  made  in  the  prospectus  issued  nearly  a 
year  ago. 

The  outline  history  of  the  county,  city  and  township  histories  were  prepared  by  F.  E.  Weakley,  of 
Lebanon,  Ohio,  who  has  spared  no  pains  in  extended  research  and  investigation  into  all  matters  pertaining  to 
the  early  explorations  and  settlement  of  the  Whitewater  Valley,  and  the  subsequent  development  and  growth 
of  that  portion  of  it  under  consideration.  The  libraries,  both  State  and  city,  at  Indianapolis,  and  that  of 
the  neighboring  city  of  Richmond  were  visited,  and  all  volumes  throwing  any  light  on  every  important  field 
consulted.  The  archives  of  the  county  which  originally  comprised  the  greater  part  of  Fayette,  have  been 
examined;  private  correspondence  has  been  held  with  men  acquainted  with  the  history  of  the  county;  news- 
paper files,  court  records  and  Justices'  dockets  have  been  examined;  local  laws,  books,  pamphlets,  agricult- 
ural reports,  church  records,  etc.,  etc.,  have  been  consulted;  manuscripts  and  obituary  notices  read,  grave- 
yards visited,  and  the  oldest  and  most  reliable  citizens  have  been  called  upon.  In  its  preparation  great  care 
has  been  taken  to  arrive  at  accuracy,  but  undoubtedly  errors  will  be  found,  owing  to  almost  numberless 
causes,  among  which  are  inaccurate  and  ambiguous  records  and  manuscripts,  meager  public  documents  and 
numerous  conflicting  traditions.  While  free  to  admit  that  some  unavoidable  errors  may  be  found,  on  the 
other  hand  it  is  claimed  that  the  work  is  up  to  the  standard  of  our  promises,  and  more  accurate  and  compre- 
hensive than  could  be  anticipated  in  the  beginning.  With  what  fidelity  to  facts  and  patience  of  research  the 
task  has  been  performed  is  left  to  the  judgment  of  those  in  whose  keeping  the  traditions  of  the  past  remain. 
Sources  from  which  much  of  the  data  came  have  been  indicated  throughout  the  work.  The  sketches  in  the 
biographical  department  were  prepared  by  a  corps  of  men  well  fitted  for  the  work,  who  visited,  in  person,  the 
various  families,  and  faithfully  aimed  at  correctness.  This  part  will  be  found  an  important  feature  of  the 
work,  for  in  the  personal  and  family  histories  given  in  these  sketches  are  traced  the  descent  of  families  and 
recorded  individual  achievements,  which  in  succeeding  years  will  be  found  to  possess  interest  and  value. 

To  the  county  and  city  officers,  editors  of  the  newspapers,  officers  of  the  various  societies  and  churches, 
and  many  intelligent  citizens  of  Fayette  County,  the  publishers  are  indebted  for  favors  and  generous  assist- 
ance in  the  preparation  of  the  work,  which  they  hope  will  meet  the  approval  of  an  intelligent  people.     Special

PROGRESS  OF  THE  NEW  STATE. 


INDIANA,  as  a  civil  division  bearing  the  name, 
dates  its  existence  from  July  4,  1800,  when  the 
act  of  Congress  creating  Indiana  Territory  went  into 
effect.  It  then  included  Michigan,  Illinois  and  Wis- 
consin. The  United  States  census  of  1800  found  in 
Indiana  5,641  inhabitants.  In  1805  Michigan  Terri- 
tory was  struck  off,  and  in  1809,  Illinois;  from  the 
latter  year  Indiana  dates  its  present  limits.  On 
December  11,  1816  the  Territory  was  admitted  into 
the  Union  as  a  State.  From  its  first  exploration  by 
white  men  Indiana  constituted  a  part  of  New  France 
until  1763,  when  it  was  ceded  by  the  French  to  the 
English.  In  the  treaty  of  1783  Indiana  was  included 
in  the  territory  yielded  by  Great  Britain  to  the 
United  States.  While  it  belonged  to  the  English  it 
was  a  part  of  the  Colony  of  Virginia,  and  was  ceded 
to  the  United  States  bj'  Virginia  in  1784,  from  which 
time  until  the  formation  of  Indiana  Territory  it 
formed  a  part  of  the  Northwest  Territory. 

Virginia  acquired  title  to  the  great  territory 
northwest  of  the  Ohio  by  its  several  charters  from 
James  I,  and  especially  from  the  one  bearing  date  of 
May  23,  1609  in  which  was  granted  all  the  territory 
along  the  coast  for  four  hundred  miles  and  extend- 
ing "up  into  the  land  throughout  from  sea  to  sea.'' 
Virginia  first  attempted  to  exercise  authority  over 
this  extensive  domain  in  1769,  when   the  House   of 


Burgesses  passed  an  act  establishing  the  connty  of 
Botetourt,  with  the  Mississippi  Kiver  as  its  western 
boundary.  Fincastle,  Va.,  was  the  seat  of  jus- 
tice of  this  extensive  county.  In  October,  1788,  a 
Virginia  statute  provided  that  "all  the  citizens  of  the 
Commonwealth  of  Virginia  who  are  already  settled  or 
shall  hereafter  settle  on  the  western  side  of  the  Ohio, 
shall  be  included  in  a  distinct  county,  which  shall  be 
called  Illinois  County."  Col.  John  Todd  served 
under  appointment  of  the  Governor  of  Virginia  as 
Civil  Commandant  and  Lieutenant  of  Illinois,  until 
his  death  at  the  battle  of  Blue  Licks  in  1782. 

THE    FRENCH    IN  INDIANA. 

The  first  explorations  and  settlements  of  the 
whites  were  by  the  French,  and  were  the  results  of  the 
enterprise  of  LaSalle,  who  set  out  from  Canada  in 
1679,  and  passing  across  the  lakes  descended  the  Illi- 
nois River.  The  Indians  inhabiting  the  country  at 
that  time  seem  to  have  made  little  or  no  opposition 
to  its  occupancy  by  the  neW-comers,  and  several 
important  French  towns  were  established  on  the  Illi- 
nois and  Wabash  before  the  eighteenth  century  was 
far  advanced.  The  missions  and  settlements  of  the 
French  were  of  necessity  established  along  the  routes 
of  travel  from  Canada  to  the  mouth  of  the  Missis- 
sippi.     The   only    mode    of  travel  was   by    canoes.

HISTORY   OF   PAYETTE    COUNTY. 


Among  the  portages  over  which  the  French  carried 
their  canoes  from  one  navigable  river  to  another,  one 
was  of  three  miles'  length  in  St.  Joseph  County^ 
Ind.,  from  the  St.  Joseph  River  to  the  Kankakee; 
another  was  from  the  Maumee  near  Ft.  Wayne  to  the 
Wabash. 

The  exact  period  of  the  first  French  settlements 
cannot  be  ascertained.  Early  in  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury a  party  of  French  Canadians  descended  the 
Wabash,  and  several  settlements  were  soon  established 
along  its  banks;  among  others  Vincennes.  Many 
dates  have  been  given  of  the  establishment  of  Vin- 
cennes, some  of  which  are  mere  conjectures.  Volney 
conjectured  the  settlement  to  have  been  made  about 
1735;  Bishop  Brute  speaks  of  a  missionary  station 
there  in  1700;  Bancroft  says  a  military  post  was 
formed  there  in  1716,  and  in  1742  a  settlement  of 
herdsmen  was  made;  Judge  Law  dates  the  post  back 
to  1710  or  1711,  and  the  New  American  Cyclopedia 
says  the  party  of  French  Canadians  descended  the 
Wabash  in  1702  and  established  towns  along  the 
river.  At  one  time  the  French  settlements  were  rep- 
resented as  in  a  flourishing  condition  and  this  par^ 
of  New  France  was  described  as  a  new  paradise,  but 
the  settlers  degenerated,  became  ignorant  and  sloth- 
ful, and  but  little  superior  to  the  Indians  among 
whom  they  lived. 

GEN.  Clark's  conquest  of  the  bbitish  posts. 
During  the  Revolution  most  of  the  Western  In- 
dians adhered  to  the  British.  The  possession  by  the 
British  of  the  posts  established  by  the  French  at 
Detroit,  Kaskaskia  and  Vincennes  gave  them  easy  and 
constant  access  to  the  Indian  tribes  of  the  Northwest. 
The  bold  plan  of  defeating  and  expelling  the  British 
from  their  Western  posts  was  conceived  and  brilliant- 
ly executed  by  a  Kentucky  backwoodsman,  George 
Rogers  Clark.  By  spies  sent  for  the  purpose,  who 
were  absent  from  April  20  to  June  22,  1777,  Clark 
satisfied  himself  that  an  enterprise  against  the  West, 
ern  settlements  might  easily  be  successful.  He  went 
to  Virginia  and  submitted  his  plans  to  the  Govern- 
ment of  that  State.  Gov.  Patrick  Henry  gave  him 
written  instructions,  authorizing  him  to  enlist  seven 
companies  to  serve  under  his  orders  for  three  months- 
Clark's  rank  at  this  time  was  Lieutenant-Colonel.  He 
raised  three  companies  at  Pittsburgh,  and  descended 
the  Ohio  to  the  falls,  where  he  was  joined  by  another 
company  of  Kentucky  recruits.  He  loft  the  falls 
with  four  companies  on  the  21th  of  June,  1778,  dur- 
ing a  total  eclipse  of  the  sun.  He  descended  the 
river  to  Fort  Massac,  and  thence  proceeded  by  land 
to  Kaskaskia,  a  distance  of  over  100  miles.  Heavy 
rains  had  fallen,  and  were  succeeded  by  hot,  sultry 
weather.     Their  route  lay  through  a  wilderness  with- 


out a  path.  On  the  prairies  a  July  sun  beat  upon 
them.  Their  guide  became  bewildered.  On  the  4th 
of  July  this  party  of  invaders,  with  torn  and  soiled 
garments  and  beards  of  three  weeks'  growth,  came  in 
sight  of  Kaskaskia.  The  town  contained  about  250 
houses,  and  the  inhabitants  were  mostly  French. 
Clark  sent  forward  some  'of  his  men  who  could  speak 
French  to  pass  through  the  streets,  making  proclama- 
tion that  all  the  inhabitants  must  keep  within  their 
houses,  under  penalty  of  being  shot  down  in  the 
streets.  The  next  day  the  little  army  of  invaders 
marched  into  the  town  in  two  divisions,  and  in  two 
hours  all  the  inhabitants  surrendered  and  gave  up 
their  arms.  Not  a  drop  of  blood  was  shed,  but  the 
victory  was  complete.  A  few  days  later  Clark  sent  a 
detachment  mounted  on  French  ponies  to  Cahokia, 
thirty  miles  distant,  and  obtained  a  surrender  of  the 
fort  and  garrison  at  that  point.  An  embassy  was 
sent  to  Vincennes,  and  in  a  few  days  the  American 
flag  was  floating  from  the  fort  and  the  French  inhab- 
itants brought  over  to  the  United  States. 

Clark  was  compelled  to  leave  only  a  diminutive 
force  to  hold  possession  of  Vincennes,  and  the  British 
Lieutenant-Governor,  Henry  Hamilton,  then  at  De- 
troit, formed  the  plan  of  retaking  the  place,  in  which 
he  succeeded  without  difficulty.  The  latter  had  a 
considerable  force  of  British  regulars,  French  volun- 
teers and  Indians.  Clark  with  his  main  force  was  at 
Kaskaskia,  and  his  position  was  one  of  great  peril.  His 
number  of  men  was  too  small  to  stand  a  siege  and 
his  situation  too  remote  to  call  for  recruits.  He 
formed  the  bold  and  hazardous  scheme  of  capturing 
Governor  Hamilton  and  retaking  Vincennes. 

On  the  7th  of  February,  1779,  Col.  Clark  with 
his  little  army  commenced  its  march  from  Kaskaskia 
to  Vincennes.  Their  route  lay  through  prairies  and 
points  of  timber.  The  winter  was  unusually  wet  and 
the  streams  all  high.  On  the  13th  of  February  they 
arrived  at  the  Little  Wabash  and  Muddy  Rivers. 
The  raius  fell  every  day,  and  here  the  men  were  com- 
pelled to  wade  to  their  waists  and  sometimes  to  their 
armpits  in  mud  and  water.  On  the  18th,  eleven  days 
after  their  departure,  they  heard  the  morning  gun  of 
the  fort  at  Vincennes.  On  the  evening  of  the  same 
day  they  were  at  the  Wabash,  below  the  mouth  of  the 
Embarrass.  The  party  was  now  in  an  exhausted  con- 
dition; the  river  was  out  of  its  banks  and  all  the  low 
grounds  covered  with  water.  Again  making  their 
way  through  deep  waters  they  arrived  in  full  view  of 
the  town  a  little  before  sunset  on  the  21st.  In  order 
to  make  his  force  appear  formidable  Clark  ordered 
his  men  to  march  and  countermarch  i  n  such  a  manner 
that  from  the  intervening  ground  the  enemy  were  led 
to  count  them  twice  or  thrice.  Ten  or  twelve  pairs  of 
colors  were  so  displayed  on  long  poles  as  to  be  seen

above  the  intervening  high  land  and  from  a  distance 
made  no  despicable  ajspearance.  Gov.  Hamilton  was 
awed  into  a  surrender,  which  was  formally  made  on 
the  24th. 

The  expedition  of  Col.  Clark  was  not  excelled  in 
difficTilty,  daring  and  heroic  endurance  by  any  during 
the  Revolution.  The  march  from  Kaskaskia  to  Vin- 
cennes  was  one  of  extraordinary  hardship  and  enter- 
prise. The  whole  expedition  resulted  in  the  success- 
ful reduction  of  all  (he  British  military  posts  between 
the  Ohio  and  Mississippi,  gave  tranquility  to  the  fron- 
tier settlements  and  secured  to  the  United  States  the 
whole  of  this  vast  territory.  The  Virginia  Legisla- 
ture passed  a  complimentary  resolution  to  Clark  and 
his  men  for  their  victorious  campaign  "whereby  great 
advantages  may  accrue  to  the  common  cause  of  Amer- 
ica, as  well  as  to  this  Commonwealth  in  particular." 

THE    NORTHWEST    TERRITORY. 

After  Virginia  and  other  States  had  coded  to  the 
United  States  their  claims  of  jurisdiction  and  soil  to 
the  territory  lying  northwest  of  the  Ohio,  it  became 
necessary  for  Congi^ss  to  establish  civil  government 
in  the  new  extensive  region.  Accordingly  in  the 
summer  of  1787,  while  the  convention  which  framed 
the  Constitution  was  in  session  at  Philadelphia, 
Congress  at  New  York  passed  an  "Ordinance  for  the 
government  of  the  territory  of  the  United  States 
northwest  of  the  River  Ohio,"  which  has  come  to  be 
beat  known  as  "The  Ordinance  of  '87."  This  was 
the  most  important  act  of  Congress  under  the  Arti- 
cles of  Confederation.  For  nearly  twenty-nine  years 
it  was  the  fundamental  law  of  Indiana.  S.  P.  Chase 
in  his  history  of  Ohio  said  of  it:  "  Never,  probably, 
in  the  history  of  the  world,  did  a  measiu'e  of  legisla- 
tion 80  accurately  fulfill,  and  yet  so  mightily  exceed 
the  anticipations  of  the  legislators."  Its  object  was 
declared  to  be  to  "  extend  the  fundamental  principles 
of  civil  and  religious  liberty  which  form  the  basis 
whereon  these  republics,  their  laws  and  constitutions 
are  erected;  to  fix  and  establish  those  principles  as 
the  basis  of  all  laws,  constitutions  and  governments, 
which  forever  hereafter  shall  be  formed  in  the  said 
territory;  to  provide  also  for  the  establishment  of 
States  and  permanent  government  therein,  and  for 
their  admission  to  a  share  in  the  federal  councils  on 
an  equal  footing  with  the  original  States  at  as  early 
periods  as  may  be  consistent  with  the  general  inter- 
est." 

The  territory  for  which  this  ordinance  provided 
a  government  embraced  all  the  land  then  belonging 
to  the  United  States  northwest  of  the  Ohio.  It  ex- 
tended from  Pennsylvania  to  the  Mississippi,  and 
from  the  Ohio  to  the  Great  Lakes.  Five  States  have 
been   organized    from    it:     Ohio,    Indiana,    Illinois, 


Michigan  and  Wisconsin.  The  Territorial  Govern- 
ment was  organized  soon  after  the  passage  of  the 
ordinance  and  at  first  was  vested  solely  in  a  Governor 
and  Judges.  The  first  Governor  was  Gen.  Arthur  St. 
Clair  who  was  President  of  Congress  when  appointed. 
In  1788  he  entered  upon  his  duties  at  Marietta. 
During  the  continuance  of  the  first  grade  of  govern- 
ment, there  was  no  capital  of  the  territory  in  the 
proper  sense  of  the  term.  Laws  were  passed  by  the 
Governor  and  Judges  wherever  they  happened  to  be 
assembled.  Some  were  enacted  at  Marietta,  some  at 
Cincinnati  and  a  few  at  Vincennes. 

About  the  Ist  of  January,  1790,  the  Governor, 
with  other  officers,  descended  the  Ohio  from  Marietta 
to  Fort  Washington,  at  Cincinnati,  where  he  organ- 
ized Hamilton  County,  which  embraced  the  western 
part  of  the  State  of  Ohio.  On  the  8th  of  January  the 
Governor  and  Secretary  arrived  at  Clarksville,  at  the 
falls  of  the  Ohio,  on  their  way  to  Vincennes.  From 
the  falls  they  proceeded  by  land  along  an  Indian 
trail  to  Vincennes,  where  they  organized  the  county 
of  Knox,  the  fourth  county  organized  in  the  North- 
west Territory.  It  comprised  all  the  territory  along 
the  Ohio  between  the  Great  Miami  and  the  Wabash. 
V^incennes  was  made  the  seat  of  justice.  Thence  they 
proceeded  to  Kaskaskia,  and  there  established  the 
County  of  St.  Clair,  comprising  all  the  territory  from 
the  Wabash  to  the  Mississippi,  and  named  by  the 
Secretary,  Winthrop  Sargent,  in  honor  of  the  Gov- 
ernor. Knox  and  St.  Clair  Counties  were  organized 
for  the  protection  of  the  French  inhabitants,  and  to 
carry  into  effect  the  agreement  in  the  ordinance  of 
1787  with  reference  to  the  preservation  of  their  rights 
under  the  laws  and  customs  alreading  existing  among 
them.  At  Kaskaskia  the  Governor  issued  a  proclama- 
tion, calling  upon  the  French  inhabitants  to  exhibit 
the  titles  to  their  lands,  in  order  to  have  them  exam- 
ined and  confirmed  and  their  lands  surveyed. 


INDIANA    TERRITORY    FORMED. 


The  great  extent  of  the  Territory  made  the  ordi- 
nary operations  of  government  extremely  uncertain, 
and  the  efficient  action  of  courts  almost  impossible 
in  the  western  parts  of  the  Territory.  In  the  three 
western  places  of  holding  courts,  Vincennes,  Cahokia 
and  Kaskaskia,  there  had  been  held  but  one  court 
having  criminal  jurisdiction  in  the  five  years  from 
1795  to  1800.  Offenders  against  justice  having  no 
fear  of  punishment,  the  French  settlements  became 
an  asylum  for  the  most  vile  and  abandoned  crimi- 
nals. A  committee  of  Congress  on  March  3,  1800, 
recommended  a  division  of  the  Territory  into  two 
distinct  and  separate  governments.  Accordingly,  on 
May  7,  1800,  an  act  was  passed  by  Congress  making 
such  division,  by  an   act  which  took  effect  from  and 


16 


HISTORY   OF  PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


after  the  succeeding  4th  day  of  July.     The  western 
division  was  called  Indiana  Territory. 

The  Hrst  boundary  of  Indiana  Territory  on  the 
east  was  not  the  same  as  the  eastern  boundary  of  the 
State.  The  ordinance  of  1787  provided  that  the  mid- 
dle State  which  should  be  formed  out  of  the  North- 
west Territory,  should  be  bounded  on  the  east  by  a 
line  drawn  due  north  from  the  mouth  of  the  Great 
Miami  River,  and  the  committee  of  Congress  which 
proposed  the  division  of  the  Territory  recommended 
that  the  division  should  be  made  by  this  line.  The 
act  of  Congress,  however,  made  the  Greenville  treaty 
line  as  far  as  Fort  Recovery,  the  boundary  line.  The 
line  of  division  was  described  as  "  beginning  at  the 
Ohio,  opposite  to  the  mouth  of  the  Kentucky  River, 
and  running  thence  to  Fort  Recovery,  and  thence 
north  until  it  shall  intersect  the  Territorial  line  be- 
tween the  United  States  and  Canada."  The  Green- 
ville treaty  line  is  found  marked  on  some  of  the 
maps  of  Indiana.  Fort  Recovery  was  in  Darke  Coun- 
ty, Ohio,  about  one  mile  east  of  the  State  line. 
When  Ohio  was  made  a  State  the  line  drawn  due 
north  from  the  mouth  of  the  Great  Miami  was  made 
its  western  boundary,  and  the  lands  between  this  line 
and  the  Greenville  treaty  line  were  attached  to  Indi- 
ana Territory. 

CONDITION    or    THE    TERRITORY    AT    ITS    ORGANIZATION. 

At  the  time  of  its  organization  Indiana  Territory 
comprised  a  vast  region  almost  uninhabited  except  by 
savages.  The  only  settlements  of  white  men  were  so 
widely  separated  that  it  was  impossible  for  them  to 
contribute  to  their  mutual  defense  or  encouragement. 
These  settlements  were  four  in  number.  The  first 
was  at  Clark's  grant,  at  the  falls  of  the  Ohio  opposite 
Louisville;  the  second  the  old  French  establishment 
at  Vincennes,  on  the  Wabash;  the  third  comprised  a 
series  of  French  villages,  extending  from  Kaskaskia, 
seventy-five  miles  below  the  site  of  St.  Louis,  to 
Cahokia,  five  miles  below  St.  Louis;  the  fourth  was 
Detroit  on  the  Detroit  River.  The  capital  was  at 
Vincennes,  at  this  time  often  written  Post  Vincents. 
Numerous  tribes  of  war-like  Indians  were  scattered 
throughout  the  northern  portion  of  the  Territory, 
whose  hostility  to  the  American  settlers  was  inflamed 
by  the  intrigues  of  British  agents  and  fi-equent  out- 
rages by  American  hunters  and  traders. 

Clark's  grant  in  Indiana  was  a  reservation  by  Vir- 
ginia in  her  cession  of  the  Northwest  Territory  to 
satisfy  the  claims  of  Gen.  Clark  and  the  ofiicers  and 
soldiers  under  his  command  in  the  conquest  of  the 
British  posts  of  Kaskaskia  and  Vincennes.  The  quan- 
tity of  land  in  the  grant  was  stipulated  not  to  exceed 
150,000  acres  to  be  laid  off  in  one  tract,  the  length 
of  which  was  not  to  exceed  double  the  breadth,  and 


in  such  place  on  the  northwest  side  of  the  Ohio,  as 
a  majority  of  the  officers  should  choose.  The  tract 
was  selected  and  located  about  the  falls  of  the  Ohio, 
and  distributed  among  the  claimants  according  to  the 
laws  of  Virginia.  An  act  of  the  Legislature  of  that 
State  was  passed  "  to  establish  the  town  of  Clarkes- 
ville,  at  the  falls  of  the  Ohio,  in  the  county  of  Illi- 
nois," by  which  a  Board  of  Trustees  in  whom  the  title 
of  the  town  was  vested  in  trust.  They  were  directed 
to  sell  lots  of  half  an  acre  each  at  public  auction, 
subject  to  the  condition  that  the  purchaser  should 
within  three  years  from  the  day  of  sale  erect  a  dwel- 
ling house  "  twenty  feet  by  eighteen,  with  a  brick  or 
stone  chimney."  The  Trustees  located  the  tovsm  im- 
mediately at  the  foot  of  the  falls.  Its  position  at  the 
head  of  keel-boat  navigation  on  the  lower  Ohio  was 
supposed  to  give  it  great  advantages,  and  it  was  for 
a  time  a  rival  of  Louisville.  Jeffersonville,  at  the  head 
of  the  falls,  occupied  the  site  of  Fort  Steuben.  Mid- 
way between  these  places  and  on  the  opposite  side  of 
the  river  was  the  then  unhealthy  town  of  Louisville, 
which  in  1800  contained  a  population  of  359  souls, 
and  about  150  houses,  a  printing  office  and  a  postoflice. 

From  the  falls  of  the  Ohio,  settlements  spread  over 
Clark's  grant.  Vincennes,  the  capital  of  the  Terri- 
tory, is  described  by  contemporary  writers  at  the 
period  of  the  establishment  of  the  Territorial  Gov- 
ernment, as  a  handsome  town  of  about  100  houses, 
some  of  which  were  built  of  freestone.  From  Cin- 
cinnati, settlements  extended  up  the  Whitewater  Val- 
ley. On  the  first  Monday  in  April,  1801,  the  first 
sale  of  lands  west  of  the  Great  Miami  was  held  at 
Cincinnati.  In  the  closing  years  of  the  last  century, 
before  the  establishment  of  a  land  ofiBce  for  the  sale 
of  any  lands  in  Indiana,  squatters  had  begun  to 
occupy  Government  lands  in  the  southwestern'  part. 
Land  offices,  at  which  lands  in  Indiana  were  sold, 
were  established  by  the  United  States  as  follows:  At 
Cincinnati,  May  10,  1800;  at  Vincennes,  March  26, 
1804;  at  Jeffersonville,  March  3,  1S07;  at  Indianap- 
olis and  Crawfordsville,  March  3,  1819;  Fort  Wayne, 
May  8,  1822. 

From  Cincinnati,  the  most  important  town  in  the 
eastern  division  of  the  Northwest  Territory,  to  Vin- 
cennes,the  capital  of  Indiana  Territory,  was  a  laborious 
journey  through  a  wilderness.  A  common  method  of 
making  this  journey  was  to  embark  on  the  Ohio  in  a 
Kentucky  boat,  sometimes  called  an  ark,  with  horses 
and  provisions,  proceed  as  far  as  the  falls,  and  thence 
by  horseback  to  the  Post,  more  than  100  miles  un- 
marked by  a  vestige  of  civilization. 

THE    FIRST    GOVERNOR. 

The  first  Governor  of  Indiana  Territory  was  Capt. 
William  Henry  Harrison,    afterward  Major-General 


HISTORY    OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY.

and  President.  At  the  time  of  his  appointment  he 
was  twenty-seven  years  old,  yet  he  had  already  served 
under  Wayne  against  the  Indians  as  Lieutenant,  and 
distinguished  himself  for  bravery;  had  been  the  first 
delegate  in  Congress  from  the  Northwest  Territory,  and 
had  served  as  Secretary  of  the  Territory.  As  the  Sec- 
retary was  ex  officio  Lieutenant-Governor,  he  had  for 
a  considerable  time  performed  the  duties  of  Governor 
of  the  Territory  before  its  division,  Gen.  St.  Clair, 
the  Governor,  being  rarely  in  the  Territory  at  that 
time,  his  residence  being  in  Pennsylvania.  When 
the  office  of  Governor  of  the  new  Territory  of  Indiana 
was  first  proposed  to  young  Harrison,  he  expressed 
himself  as  much  adverse  to  accepting  it,  because  he 
had  reason  to  believe  that  Gov.  St.  Clair  would  soon 
be  retired  from  the  Government  of  the  more  populous 
Eastern  Division  (now  Ohio),  and  that  he  would  be 
strongly  recommended  as  his  successor.  It  happened, 
however,  as  Gen.  Harrison  himself  has  narrated,  that 
two  influential  supporters  of  John  Adams'  administra- 
tion were  desirous  of  that  position,  and  by  their  man- 
agement he  became  the  Governor  of  Indiana  Territory. 
The  Governors  were  appointed  for  three  years.  Har- 
rison was  appointed  by  President  Adams  in  1800; 
upon  the  expiration  of  his  term  he  was  re-appointed 
in  1803  by  President  Jefferson;  in  1806  he  was  again 
appointed  by  Jefferson;  in  1809  he  was  re-appointed 
by  Pi-esident  Madison,  and  in  1812  again  appointed 
by  Madison. 

The  Territorial  Governors  were  ex  officio  Super- 
intendents of  Indian  affairs  within  their  Territories. 
A  few  months  after  President  Jefferson  came  into 
ofllice  he  nominated  Gov.  Harrison  a  Commissioner  to 
make  treaties  with  the  Indians,  and  the  nomination 
was  confirmed  by  the  Senate.  The  custom  of  the 
Government  in  treating  with  the  Indians  had  been  to 
appoint  two  or  more  persons  to  represent  the  Govern- 
ment as  Commissioners.  The  reason  given  by  the 
President  for  this  departure  from  the  usual  course  in 
the  case  of  Indiana  Territory  was  that  Louisiana  had 
been  ceded  to  the  French,  and  the  French  under- 
stood the  management  of  the  Indians  better  than  any 
other  nation;  that  to  guard  against  their  intrigues  it 
was  necessary  to  form  settlements  on  the  Mississippi, 
the  lower  Ohio,  the  Wabash  and  Illinois  Rivers,  which 
could  only  be  done  by  extinguishing  the  Indian  titles, 
and  this  could  not  be  done  at  once,  but  by  watching 
opportunities.  The  President,  therefore,  did  not  wish 
to  embarrass  the  Governor  with  a  colleague.  Thus 
it  was  that  Harrison  was  the  sole  representative  of 
the  United  States  in  the  negotiations  with  the  Indians 
by  which  the  Indian  title  to  most  of  the  lands  of 
Indiana  was  extinguished.  Gov.  Harrrison  held  this 
important  commission  during  the  entire  period  of  his 
government  of  the  Territory.    He  negotiated  thirteen 


treaties,  and  obtained  the  cession  of  over  50,000,000 
of  acres  in  the  Northwest,  more  than  double  the  land 
now  included  in  Indiana. 

While  acting  as  Commissioner,  Harrison  was 
allowed,  in  addition  to  his  pay  as  Governor,  $6  per 
day  and  his  expenses,  and  he  could  assume  the  char- 
acter of  Indian  Commissioner  whenever  he  thought 
proper.  He  was  indeed  necessarily  almost  constantly 
acting  under  it.  The  charges  he  made  for  pay  as 
Commissioner,  however,  were  only  for  the  time  actu- 
ally employed  in  specific  negotiation.  All  the  com- 
pensation he  received  for  these  services  during  the 
twelve  years  he  held  the  commission  did  not  exceed 
$3,000.  His  charge  for  one  important  treaty  was 
$44.  It  is  said  that  no  man  over  disbursed  so  many 
and  such  large  sums  of  public  treasure  with  so  little 
difficulty  in  adjusting  his  accounts  with  the  Govern- 
ment as  Harrison  while  Governor,  United  States  Com- 
missioner and  Superintendent  of  Indian  affairs  in 
Indiana  Territory.  He  wisely  avoided  keeping  the 
public  money  on  hand,  and  always  made  his  payments 
by  drafts  on  Washington. 

Some  of  the  more  important  of  the  early  treaties 
by  which  the  ownership  of  Indiana  lands  was  trans- 
ferred to  the  United  States  Government  are  here 
mentioned.  In  the  treaty  at  Greenville,  August  3, 
1795,  only  a  small  portion  of  the  lands  in  the  south- 
eastern part  of  the  State  was  included.  On  Sep- 
tember 17,  1802,  Gov.  Harrison  entered  into  an 
agreement  at  Vincennes  with  the  chiefs  of  various 
tribes  by  which  the  bounds  of  a  tract  at  that  place 
said  to  have  been  given  to  its  founder  were  settled, 
and  on  June  7,  1803,  at  Fort  Wayne,  the  same  chiefs 
ceded  the  lands  about  Vincennes  to  the  United  Stales. 
Other  treaties  were  concluded  at  Vincennes  in  August, 
1804:  at  Fort  Wayne  in  September,  1809;  at  St. 
Mary's  in  October,  1818,  and  Tippecanoe  in  1832. 

TECUMSEH  AND  THE  PKOPHET. 

The  troubles  with  the  Indians  commenced  early 
in  the  history  of  the  Territory.  In  July,  1801,  the 
Governor  referring  to  the  lawless  acts  of  vagabond 
whites,  wrote  to  the  United  States  Government:  "All 
these  injuries  the  Indians  have  hitherto  borne  with 
astonishing  patience,  but  though  they  discover  no 
disposition  to  make  war  upon  the  United  States,  I 
am  confident  that  most  of  the  tribes  would  eagerly 
seize  any  favorable  opportunity  for  that  purpose,  and 
should  the  United  States  be  at  war  with  any  Euro- 
pean nations  who  are  known  to  the  Indians,  there 
would  probably  be  a  combination  of  nine-tenths  of 
the  northern  tribes  against  us,  unless  some  means  are 
made  use  of  to  conciliate  them."  President  Jefferson 
did  everything  in  his  power  to  protect  the  Indians 
and  to  induce  them  to  cultivate  the  soil   and  adopt

the  arts  of  civilized  life.  Congress  was  powerless  to 
prevent  the  atrocities  committed  by  the  worthless 
white  men  who  are  ever  found  prowling  along  the 
verge  of  civilization.  The  outrages  were  deplored  by 
thousands  of  good  men. 

Early  in  the  history  of  the  Territory  Tocumsoh 
planned  his  scheme  of  a  confederation  of  all  the 
Indian  nations,  by  which  the  whites  were  to  be 
restrained  in  their  acquisitions  of  lands.  This 
remarkable  man,  the  most  bold  and  accomplished 
warrior  and  diplomatist  the  tribes  of  red  men  ever 
produced,  was  for  much  of  his  active  life  a  resident 
of  Indiana.  He  was  born  not  far  from  the  site  of 
Springfield,  Ohio,  and  belonged  to  the  Shawnee 
nation,  his  father  and  his  mother  being  members  of 
different  tribes  of  that  extensive  people.  In  1795  he 
became  a  chief.  He  resided  in  different  parts  of  the 
Miami  country,  in  what  is  now  Ohio,  until  1798, 
when  he  accepted  the  invitation  of  the  Delawares, 
then  residing  in  part  on  White  River,  Ind.,  to 
remove  to  that  region  with  his  followers.  Here  he 
resided  a  number  of  years,  and  gradually  extended 
his  influence  among  the  Indians. 

Tecumseh's  brother,  known  in  history  as  the 
Prophet,  was  scarcely  less  remarkable  a  man;  he  was 
an  orator  of  great  power  and  a  religious  teacher. 
About  1804,  according  to  the  accounts  usually  given, 
the  brothers  began  to  work  in  unison  on  their  grand 
project  of  uniting  all  the  Western  Indians  in  one 
confederacy.  Their  avowed  objects  were  two- fold: 
first,  the  reformation  of  the  savages,  whose  habits 
unfitted  them  for  continuous  and  heroic  efforts;  sec- 
ond, a  union  which  would  make  the  purchase  of  land 
by  the  United  States  impossible  without  the  consent 
of  all  the  tribes,  and  would  give  the  Indians  a 
strength  that  would  be  dreaded.  In  case  of  war 
with  the  whites  a  simultaneous  attack  could  be  made 
upon  all  the  frontier  settlements,  so  that  white  troops 
could  not  be  sent  from  one  to  the  aid  of  another.  In 
1805,  through  the  influence  of  the  Prophet,  a  large 
number  of  Indians  collected  at  Greenville.  In  1806 
both  Tecumseh  and  the  Prophet  were  at  Greenville, 
and  were  visited  by  representatives  of  many  tribes. 

APPREHENSION   OP    INDIAN    HOSTILITIES. 

In  the  spring  of  1808  the  brothers  removed  to  a 
tract  of  land  on  the  Tippecanoe,  a  tributary  of  the 
Wabash.  Here  on  a  spot  probably  never  visited  by 
white  men,  about  100  miles  northwest  from  Fort 
Wayne,  was  the  Prophet's  town,  containing  only 
about  130  souls.  Representative  Indians  from  remote 
parts  here  visited  the  Prophet,  who  continued  his 
efforts  to  reform  his  brethren  by  preaching  temper- 
ance, depicting  the  fearful  evils  the  fire-water  of  the 
white  men  had  brought  upon  them,  and  announcing 


his  commission  from  the  Great  Spirit  to  extricate  his 
red  children  from  the  utter  ruin  with  which  they 
were  menaced. 

Tecumseh  traveled  from  tribe  to  tribe,  strength- 
ening his  influence  and  organizing  his  league.  With 
the  enthusiasm  of  Peter  the  Hermit,  he  journeyed 
over  thousands  of  miles,  visiting  remote  nations  of 
red  men.  He  visited  all  the  northern  tribes  on  the 
west  bank  of  the  Mississippi,  and  upon  the  Lakes 
Superior,  Huron  and  Michigan.  In  1807  Gov.  Har- 
rison, alarmed  at  the  movements  of  the  two  brothers, 
sent  a  message  of  inquiry  and  remonstrance,  couched 
in  severe  terms.  The  Prophet  sent  a  reply,  denying 
that  he  had  any  purpose  to  rouse  the  tribes  to  another 
war.  His  plan  of  saving  the  Indians,  he  constantly 
asserted,  was  by  reforming  them  froai  intemperance, 
uniting  them  and  encouraging  industry.  In  July,  1808, 
the  Prophet  went  from  Tippecanoe  to  Vincennes,  a 
distance  of  hundreds  of  miles,  on  a  pacific  message 
to  the  Governor.  He  came  with  a  large  number  of 
followers,  whom  he  frequently  harangued  in  the 
presence  of  the  Governor  on  the  evils  of  war  and 
intemperance.  No  persuasion  of  the  whites  could 
induce  any  of  them  to  touch  intoxicating  liquors. 
The  Prophet  again  declared  that  it  was  his  desire  to 
live  in  peace  with  the  whites,  and  called  the  Great 
Spirit  to  witness  the  truth  of  his  declaration. 
Whether  the  Prophet  was  a  religious  fanatic  or  a 
vile  impostor,  can  never  be  settled. 

Throughout  the  year  1809  Tecumseh  and  the 
Prophet  continued  to  strengthen  themselves  both 
openly  and  secretly.  Notwithstanding  the.se  solemn 
and  repeated  declarations  of  peaceful  intentions,  the 
Governor  suspected  their  ultimate  designs,  and  was 
preparing  to  meet  any  emergency.  In  June,  1809,  • 
Tecumseh  with  about  forty  followers  again  visited  the 
Governor.  The  Governor  wrote  to  the  Government 
that  suspicions  of  his  guilty  intentions  were  strength- 
ened rather  than  diminished  by  every  interview  dur- 
ing this  visit  of  the  chief.  In  September,  1809,  the 
Governor  met  the  chiefs  of  several  tribes  at  Fort 
Wayne,  and  purchased  of  them  more  than  3,000,000 
acres  of  land  on  the  Wabash.  Tecumseh  refused  to  sign 
the  treaty,  and  threatened  death  to  those  who  did.  In 
the  year  following  he  visited  the  tribes  as  far  south 
as  Tennessee,  exhorting  them  to  lay  aside  sectiona 
jealousies  in  the  hope  of  preserving  their  hunting 
grounds. 

THE    BATTLE    OF    TIPPECANOE. 

The  Governor  stood  firm  and  sent  for  a  few  sol- 
diers and  organized  the  militia.  In  July,  1811,  the 
citizens  of  Vincennes  and  its  vicinity  met  while  the 
Legislative  Council  was  in  session  and  memorialized 
the  President  on  the  subject,  not  so  much  for  a  mill-

tary  force  from  the  Government  as  for  permission  to 
fight  the  Indians  in  their  own  way.  The  Indians 
began  to  prowl  through  the  Wabash  Valley.  Harri- 
son was  promised  strong  re-enforcements  with  orders, 
however,  to  be  backward  in  employing  them.  On 
the  Ist  of  August  he  advised  the  Secretary  of  War  of 
his  plans,  which  were  to  again  warn  the  Indians  to 
obey  the  treaty  of  Greenville,  but  at  the  same  time 
to  prepare  to  break  up  the  Prophet's  establishment, 
if  necessary.  Having  received  his  re-enforcements, 
the  Governor,  as  Commander,  advanced  from  Vin- 
cennes  up  the  Wabash.  On  the  5th  of  October  he 
was  at  Terre  Haute,  where  he  built  Fort  Harrison. 
Here  one  of  his  sentinels  was  fired  upon.  On  Octo- 
ber 31  he  was  at  the  mouth  of  the  Vermilion  River, 
where  he  built  a  block-house.  He  then  advanced 
toward  the  Prophet's  town,  still,  however,  offering 
peace  to  the  Indians.  When  within  a  few  miles  of 
the  Prophet's  town  Harrison  was  met  by  the  Indian 
embassadors,  who  expressed  surprise  at  his  advancing 
upon  them  and  said  that  an  answer  to  the  Governor's 
demands  upon  the  Indians  had  been  despatched  to 
him  by  a  Pottawattomie  who  had  left  two  days  before 
to  meet  him,  but  had  missed  him  by  taking  the  road 
on  the  south  side  of  the  Wabash.  Harrison  informed 
them  that  he  had  no  intention  of  attacking  them 
until  he  found  that  they  would  not  comply  with  his 
demands.  It  was  agreed  that  the  army  should  en- 
camp for  the  night  and  in  the  morning  an  interview 
with  the  Prophet  and  his  chiefs  should  take  place, 
and  in  the  meantime  no  hostilities  should  be  com- 
mitted. 

Before  daybreak  of  the  morning  the  treacherous 
savages  crept  upon  the  camp,  burst  upon  the  sleep- 
ing army  like  demons,  and  before  the  light  of  day 
was  far  advanced  the  battle  of  Tippecanoe  was 
fought.  Harrison  had  risen  at  a  quarter  after  four 
o'clock,  and  the  signal  for  calling  the  men  would 
have  been  given  in  two  minutes,  when  the  attack 
commenced.  Nineteen  twentieths  of  the  men  had 
never  been  in  an  action.  They  behaved  well,  took 
their  places  without  confusion,  under  an  exceedingly 
severe  fire,  and  fought  with  bravery.  The  camp  fires 
affording  the  enemy  the  means  of  taking  surer  aim, 
were  extinguished.  With  coolness  and  deliberate 
valor  the  white  men  stood  their  ground  in  darkness 
against  the  ferocity  of  the  savages,  until  daylight, 
and  then  routed  the  red  men  in  vigorous  charges. 
The  next  day  they  burned  the  Prophet's  town  and 
returned  victorious  to  Vincennes. 

The  battle  of  Tippecanoe  was  fought  on  the  7th 
of  November,  1811.  The  whites  had  in  this  action 
not  more  than  700  efficient  men — non-commissioned 
officers  and  privates;  the  Indians  were  supposed  to 
have  had  from  700  to  1,000  men.      The    loss  of  the 


whites  was  thirty-seven  killed  on  the  field,  twenty-five 
mortally  wounded  and  one  hundred  and  twenty -six 
wounded;  that  of  the  Indians  about  forty  killed  on  the 
field,  the  number  of  wounded  not  being  known. 
Among  the  killed  were  two  Kentucky  officers,  Col. 
Joseph  H.  Daviess  and  Col.  Owen.  The  battle  ground 
was  a  piece  of  dry  oak  land,  skirted  on  the  west  by 
Burnet  Creek,  with  marshy  prairies  covered  with  tall 
grass  on  the  east  and  west.  At  the  time  of  the  battle 
Harrison  held  no  raak  in  the  army,  but  as  Governor 
he  was  Commander  of  the  ludiaaa  Militia,  and  uader 
the  authority  of  the  War  Department  he  took  com- 
mand of  the  whole  force.  The  victory  made  the 
Commander  famous,  and  twice,  in  1836  and  in  1810, 
Indiana  cast  her  electoral  vote  for  "  the  hero  of  Tip- 
pecanoe." 

At  the  time  of  the  battle  Tecumseh  was  among 
the  southern  Indians.  When  on  his  return  he  learned 
that  his  brother  had  brought  on  the  attack  and  had 
been  defeated,  he  was  exceedingly  angry,  and  it  is 
said  reproached  the  Prophet  in  the  bitterest  terms. 
The  defeat  had  destroyed  the  power  of  the  brothers, 
and  crushed  the  grand  confederacy  before  it  was 
completed.  Six  months  after  the  battle  the  United 
States  declared  war  with  England.  Tecumseh  left 
ladiana  for  Fort  Maiden,  ia  Upper  Canada,  joined 
the  British  standard,  participated  in  S3yeral  engage- 
ments against  the  Americans,  and  for  his  bravery  and 
good  conduct  was  made  a  Brigadier-Geueral.  He 
was  killed  at  the  battle  of  the  Thames,  October  5, 
1813,  in  the  forty-fourth  year  of  his  age.  Harrison,  with 
whom  he  had  so  often  conferred,  was. the  commander 
of  the  enemy  against  whom  he  foaght  in  his  last 
battle. 

THE  SLiVERY    QUESTION  IN    THE    TERRITORY. 

Before  the  formation  of  the  State  constitution 
several  efforts  were  made  to  introduce^Africau  slavery 
in  a  modified  form  into  the  Territory  of  Indiana. 
Slavery  had  been  introduced  into  the  Illinois  country 
by  the  French  as  early  as  1720.  The  ordinance  of 
1787  prohibiting  slavery  in  the  Northwest  Territory 
was  a  subject  of  complaint  by  some,  who,  by  memo- 
rials to  Congress  from  time  to  time,  made  efforts  to 
obtain  a  suspension  of  the  restriction  for  a  limited 
period.  The  first  petition  to  Congress  was  from  four 
persons  in  Kaskaskia  in  1796,  asking  that  slavery 
might  be  tolerated  there.  Before  the  division  of  the 
Northwest  Territory  and  while  the  first  Territorial 
Legislature  was  in  session  at  Cincinnati  in  1799,  pe- 
titions were  presented  by  Virginians,  who  owed  lands 
northwest  of  the  Ohio,  asking  that  they  might  settle 
with  their  slaves  on  their  own  lauds.  These  peti- 
tions were  promptly  rejected,  as  the  Legislature  had 
no  power  to  suspend  an  ordinance  of  Congress. 

Many  of  the  early  settlers  of  Indiana  were  from 


20 


HISTORY   OP   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Virginia,  Kentucky  and  other  slave  States.  A  large 
proportion  ot  the  population  of  the  Territory,  while 
not  desiring  to  make  Indiana  a  slave  State,  believed 
that  a  temporary  employment  of  slave  labor  would 
greatly  encourage  immigration  and  promote  the 
growth  and  improvement  of  the  country.  Early  in 
1803  a  Territorial  Convention  was  held  at  Vincennes 
to  deliberate  on  the  interests  of  the  Territory.  Gov. 
Harrison  was  President  of  the  convention.  A  memo- 
rial was  sent  to  Congress,  together  with  a  letter  of 
the  President  of  the  convention,  declaring  the  as- 
sent of  the  people  of  Indiana  Territory  to  a  suspen- 
sion of  the  clause  of  the  ordinance  of  1787,  forbid- 
ding slavery.  John  Randolph,  from  the  committee  of 
Congress  to  which  this  letter  and  memorial  were 
referred,  reported  as  follows,  March  2,  1803: 

"That  the  rapid  population  of  the  State  of  Ohio 
sufficiently  evinces,  in  the  opinion  of  your  committee, 
that  the  labor  of  slaves  is  not  necessary  to  promote 
the  growth  and  settlement  of  colonies  in  that  region. 
That  this  labor,  demonstrably  the  dearest  of  any,  can 
only  be  employed  to  advantage  in  the  cultivation  of 
products  more  valuable  than  any  known  to  that  quar- 
ter of  the  United  States;  that  the  committee  deem  it 
highly  dangerous  and  inexpedient  to  impair  a  provi- 
sion wisely  calculated  to  promote  the  happiness  and 
prosperity  of  the  northwestern  country  and  to  give 
strength  and  security  to  that  extensive  frontier.  In 
the  salutary  operation  of  this  sagacious  and  benevo- 
lent restraint,  it  is  believed  that  the  people  of  Indi- 
ana will,  at  no  very  distant  day,  find  ample  remuner 
ation  for  a  temporary  privation  of  labor  and  of  immi- 
gration. " 

This  report  was  made  at  the  close  of  the  session 
and  the  subject  was  brought  up  again  at  the  next  ses- 
sion. The  report,  together  with  the  letter  of  Gov. 
Harri.son  and  the  memorial  of  the  inhabitants  of  Indi- 
ana, was  referred  to  a  new  committee,  of  which 
Csesar  Rodney,  of  Delaware,  was  Chairman.  This 
committee  on  February  17,  1804,  made  a  report  in 
favor  ot  the  prayer  of  the  memorial  and  offered  the 
following  resolution: 

"Resolved,  That  the  sixth  article  of  the  Ordinance 
of  1787,  which  prohibited  slavery  within  the  said 
Territory,  be  suspended  in  a  qualified  manner  for  ten 
years,  so  as  to  permit  the  introduction  of  slaves  born 
in  the  United  States,  from  any  of  the  individual  States; 
provided  that  such  individual  State  does  not  permit 
the  importation  of  slaves  from  foreign  countries.  And 
provided,  further,  that  the  descendants  of  all  such 
slaves  shall,  it  males,  be  free  at  the  age  of  twenty-five 
years,  and  if  females,  at  the  age  of  twenty-one  years." 

This  resolution  failed  to  pass  and  the  subject 
came  up  again  in  February,  1800,  when  another 
report  was  made  in  Congress  in  favor  of  the  tempo- 


rary suspension  of  the  prohibition  of  slavery  on  the 
ground  that  the  people  of  Indiana  universally  desired 
such  suspension.  At  the  session  of  the  Legislature  of 
Indiana  Territory  in  the  winter  of  1806-07,  resolu- 
tions on  the  subject  were  adopted  and  presented  to  Con- 
gress. Another  committee  of  Congress  reported  in 
favor  of  the  suspension  of  the  slavery  clause  of  the  or- 
dinance for  ten  years,  but  the  measure  was  again 
lost.  A  committee  of  the  United  States  Senate  re- 
ported on  November  13,  1807,  that  it  was  not  expo- 
dient  to  grant  the  request  of  the  Indiana  Legislature. 
To  avoid  the  restriction  in  the  ordinance  against 
slavery,  the  Territorial  Legislature  passed  an  act  Sep- 
tember 17,  1807,  entitled  "  An  Act  concerning  the 
introduction  of  negroes  and  mulattoes  into  this  Terri- 
tory." It  legalized  the  introduction  into  the  Territory 
of  persons  of  color  who  were  slaves  in  the  States  or 
Territories  by  requiring  the  owner  or  possessor  to 
enter  into  indentures  with  his  slave,  the  latter  stipu- 
lating to  serve  as  an  indentured  servant  for  a  certain 
period,  at  the  end  of  which  he  was  to  become  free. 
A  record  of  the  indenture  was  required  to  be  made  in 
the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  within  thirty  days  after 
the  introduction  of  the  slave  or  slaves.  Children 
under  fifteen  years  of  age  were  required  to  serve  their 
former  owner  or  possessor,  if  males,  until  the  age  of 
thirty-five  years;  if  females,  imtil  the  age  of  thirty- 
two  years.  Many  slave-holders  in  Virginia,  Ken- 
tucky, and  other  slave  States,  desiring  to  manumit 
their  slaves,  migrated  to  Indiana  and  availed  them- 
selves of  the  privileges  of  this  law.  In  Indiana  slaves 
before  the  expiration  of  their  term  of  servitude  were 
termed  under  the  law  "indentured  servants."  This 
form  of  servitude  was  done  away  with  in  Indiana  by 
judicial  decisions  and  in  Illinois  by  a  clause  in  the 
State  constitution.  Had  it  not  been  for  the  firmness 
of  Congress  in  resisting  what  seemed  to  be  a  popular 
demand,  Indiana  might  have  been  a  slave  State. 
The  demand  that  slave-holders  who  owned  land  in 
Indiana  should  he  permitted  to  employ  their  slaves  in 
clearing  the  forests  from  their  own  lands  seemed  just 
and  reasonable  to  many  persons  who  were  not  in 
favor  of  the  extension  of  slavery. 


THE   WAR  OF 


1812. 


At  the  commencement  of  the  war  of  1812  Indi- 
ana Territory  had  a  white  population  of  about  30,000 
souls,  chiefly  in  the  southern  portions  of  the  Territory. 
All  the  settlements  in  Indiana  as  well  as  those  in 
Ohio,  Kentucky,  Michigan  and  Illinois  were  much 
exposed  to  Indian  depredations.  The  Government 
had  hesitated  to  employ  force  against  the  Indians  in 
Indiana  lest  all  the  tribes  of  the  Northwest  should  be 
combined  against  the  United  States  in  case  of  a  war 
with  England,  which  was  imminent.     Although  Gov.

Harrison  wrote  a  few  months  after  the  battle  of  Tip- 
pecanoe, "  The  frontiers  never  enjoyed  more  perfect 
security,"  yet  as  soon  as  hostilities  between  the 
United  States  and  England  commenced  there  were 
gloomy  fears  of  the  Indians  all  along  the  western 
frontiers,  which  rose  to  universal  consternation  when 
the  intelligence  was  spread  abroad  that  the  whole  of 
our  army  under  Hull,  with  Detroit  and  Michigan,  had 
been  surrendered  to  the  combined  British  forces, 
commanded  by  Brock  and  Tecumseh,  leaving  our 
entire  outposts  in  the  Northwest  almost  defenseless. 
Three  points  needed  protection,  fort  Wayne  and  the 
Maumee,  the  Wabash,  and  the  Illinois.  The  troops 
intended  for  Fort  Wayne  were  to  be  put  under  Gen. 
Winchester,  a  Revolutionary  officer  residing  in  Ten- 
nessee, but  little  known  to  the  frontier  men;  those  for 
the  Wabash  were  to  be  under  Harrison,  whom  the  bat- 
tle of  Tippecanoe  had  given  a  military  reputation  in 
the  West;  those  for  the  Illinois  were  to  be  under 
Edwards,  Governor  of  Illinois  Territory.  Such  were 
the  intentions  of  the  Government,  but  the  action  of 
the  authorities  of  Kentucky  frustrated  them  and  for- 
tunately led  to  the  elevation  of  the  Governor  of  Indi- 
ana to  the  post  of  Commander-in-chief  of  all  the 
forces  of  the  West  and  Northwest. 

Gov.  Harrison  while  at  Cincinnati  received  from 
Gov.  Scott  a  request  to  repair  without  delay  to  Frank- 
fort. Arriving  at  the  capital  of  Kentucky,  he  found 
a  large  number  of  influential  citizens  of  Kentucky 
assembled,  some  to  witness  the  inauguration  of  Gov. 
Shelby  and  others  by  invitation  of  Gov.  Scott,  the 
retiring  Governor.  A  grand  council  had  been  held 
upon  the  course  to  be  adopted  for  the  defense  of  the 
Northwestern  frontier,  and  it  had  been  determined 
to  request  Gov.  Harrison  to  take  command  of  the 
troops  on  the  march  and  to  appoint  him  aMajor-Gen- 
eral  in  the  Kentucky  Militia.  He  accepted  the  com- 
mission, took  the  oath  required  by  the  laws  of  Ken- 
tucky and  in  a  few  hours  was  on  horseback  to  over- 
take the  troops  and  assume  command.  Gen.  Harri- 
son afterward  said  that  he  looked  upon  this  as  the 
most  honorable  appointment  he  had  ever  received. 
A  great  State,  already  distinguished  for  the  talents  of 
her  sons,  some  of  whom  were  Revolutionary  officers, 
placed  the  Governor  of  another  Territory  in  command 
of  her  troops  for  a  difficult  and  dangerous  expedition. 
On  September  17,  1812,  Harrison  was  appointed  by 
the  Government  Commander  of  the  Army  of  the  West. 

After  the  surrender  of  Detroit  and  Fort  Dearborn 
on  the  site  of  Chicago,  Forts  Wayne  and  Harrison,  in 
Indiana,  were  the  only  military  stations  on  the  north- 
western frontier  in  the  hands  of  the  Americans.  These 
were  re-enforced.  The  defeat  of  Hull  and  the  victories 
of  the  British  and  Indians  in  the  Northwest  awakened 
throughout  Indiana,  Ohio  and  Kentucky  a  determina- 


tion to  wipe  out  the  disgrace  which  had  stained  our 
arms,  and  to  avert  the  desolation  that  threatened  the 
frontier.  In  August  several  regiments  which  had 
been  raised  in  Kentucky  were  directed  to  the  aid  of 
Indiana  and  Illinois.  Vincennes  was  made  the  prin- 
cipal rendezvous,  and  Gen.  Hopkins  was  appointed 
Commander  of  the  troops  on  the  Wabash.  It  was 
arranged  that  Gen.  Hopkins,  with  between  four  and 
five  thousand  mounted  riflemen,  should  move  up  the 
Wabash  to  Fort  Harrison,  cross  over  to  the  Illinois 
country,  destroy  all  the  Indian  villages  on  the  Wabash, 
march  across  the  prairies  to  the  head-waters  of  the 
Sangamon  and  Vermillion  Rivers,  and  then  form  a 
junctionwith  the  Illinois  rangers  under  Gov.  Edwards, 
and  sweep  over  the  villages  on  the  Illinois  River.  On 
September  29,  Hopkins  wrote  to  the  Governor  of 
Kentucky:  "My  present  intention  is  to  attack  every 
Indian  settlement  on  the  Wabash,  and  to  destroy  their 
property,  then  fall  back  upon  the  Illinois;  and  I  trust, 
in  all  the  next  month,  to  perform  much  service.  Seri- 
ous opposition  I  hardly  apprehend,  although  I  intend 
to  be  prepared  for  it. "  In  accordance  with  this  deter- 
mination, Hopkins  set  out  from  Fort  Harrison  with  this 
raw  militia-men  on  October  15,  and  marched  some 
eighty  or  ninety  miles  in  the  Indian  country  without 
obtaining  sight  of  the  enemy,  when  he  was  compelled 
to  return  on  account  of  the  insubordination  among 
his  men  and  some  of  the  officers. 

Deeply  chagrined  at  the  failure  of  his  expedition, 
Gen.  Hopkins  did  not  return  to  Kentucky,  but 
remained  at  Fort  Harrison  to  await  the  raising  of 
another  and  better  disciplined  army.  On  the  11th  of 
November  he  set  out  from  Fort  Harrison  with  about 
1,200  men  on  an  expedition  against  the  Indians  of 
the  upper  Wabash.  Lieut-Col.  Butler,  with  seven 
boats  loaded  with  supplies  and  provisions,  at  the  same 
time  ascended  the  river.  On  the  19th  the  army 
arrived  at  the  Prophet's  town,  and  300  men  were  sent 
to  surprise  the  Indian  towns  on  Ponce  Passu  Creek, 
but  the  villages  were  fouud  evacuated.  On  the  20th 
a  Kickapoo  town  containing  120  cabins  was  burned, 
and  all  the  winter  provisions  of  corn  in  the  vicinity 
destroyed.  The  cold  weather  of  winter  was  rapidly 
coming  on,  many  of  the  men  were,  as  the  General  said, 
"shoeless  and  shirtless,"  and  as  the  ice  in  the  river 
began  to  obstruct  the  passage,  it  was  deemed  prudent 
to  return.  The  conduct  of  this  detachment  contrasts 
favorably  with  Hopkins'  first  army. 

The  military  system  under  which  the  wai"  of  1812 
was  carried  on  would  by  no  means  have  answered  the 
purposes  of  the  Government  in  the  greater  war  of  the 
Rebellion.  The  terms  of  service  for  which  the  men 
were  called  out  were  generally  short,  not  exceeding 
six  months.  In  many  cases  the  raw  militia-men  had 
scarcely  learned  to  drill  as  soldiers  when  their  term 


24 


HISTOKY    OF    FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


of  service  expired,  and  they  were  succeeded  by  fresh, 
untrained  recruits.  The  West,  aud  especially  the 
region  of  the  Maumee  and  Lake  Erie,  was  the  prin- 
cipal theater  of  the  war.  In  many  parts  of  the  United 
States  there  was  much  opposition  to  the  war,  but  th^ 
pioneers  of  Indiana  Territory  were  enthusiastically  in 
favor  of  the  declaration  of  war  and  its  vigorous  pros- 
ecution. Although  the  population  was  not  large,  in 
every  vicissitude  of  the  contest  the  conduct  of  the 
people  of  Indiana  was  patriotic  and  honorable.  They 
volunteered  with  alacrity,  and  endured  the  hardships 
of  the  campaigns  on  the  swamps  of  the  Maumee  and 
the  St.  Marys  with  patience  and  cheerfulness. 

Peace  was  made  with  Great  Britain  by  the  treaty 
at  Ghent,  December  24,  1814.  The  Indians,  deprived 
of  their  British  ally  and  having  lost  their  great 
leader,  Tecumseh,  renounced  all  hope  of  arresting 
the  advance  of  the  white  man.  Tribe  after  tribe 
during  the  year  1815  entered  into  treaties  of  peace 
with  the  United  States  and  acknowledged  themselves 
under  the  protection  of  the  Government.  Confidence 
was  restored  to  the  frontier  settlements  and  immigra- 
tion again  began  to  push  into  the  forests  and  prairies. 
The  campaigns  of  the  rangers  and  mounted  infantry 
who  had  traversed  the  rich  and  delightful  lands  along 
the  Wabash,  the  Sangamon  and  the  Illinois,  served  as 
explorations  of  new  and  fertile  countries  and  opened 
the  way  to  thousands  of  pioneers  and  the  formation 
of  new  settlements.  Although  large  numbers  passed 
westward  to  the  prairies  of  Illinois,  yet  Indiana  re- 
tained a  large  share  of  the  rapid  immigration.  From 
1810  to  1820  Indiana  increased  in  population  from 
24, 520  to  147, 178,  an  increase  of  500  per  cent,  a  rate 
of  growth  at  that  time  unexampled  in  the  growth  of 
American  States. 

INDIANA    ADMITTED    INTO    THE    UNION. 

In  December,  1815,  one  year  after  the  close  of  the 
war,  the  Territorial   Legislature   petitioned  Congress 


for  the  privilege  of  forming  a  State  constitution  and 
admission  into  the  Union.  A  bill  for  these  purposes 
was  passed  in  April,  1816;  soon  after  a  convention 
met  at  Corydon  and  on  June  29  adopted  the  first  con- 
stitution of  Indiana.  This  constitution  was  formed 
at  a  time  when  there  was  a  lull  of  party  violence  and 
when  the  era  of  political  good  feeling  prevailed.  On 
December  11,  1816,  the  State  was  admitted  as  a  sov- 
ereign member  of  the  Union.  Jonathan  Jennings,  who 
had  long  represented  the  Territory,  as  Delegate  in 
Congress  and  had  presided  over  the  convention  which 
formed  the  constitution,  was  the  first  Governor.  In 
January,  1821,  the  Legislature  located  the  seat  of 
government  at  Indianapolis,  and  at  the  same  time 
appointed  Commissioners  to  lay  off  a  town  at  the  site 
selected  and  gave  it  its  present  name,  formed  by  add- 
ing the  Greek  word  polis,  meaning  a  city,  to  the  name 
of  the  State. 

PBOGKESS  or  THE  NEW  STATE. 

In  the  decade  from  1820  to  1830  the  sales  of  gov- 
ernment lands  in  the  State  were  rapid,  amounting  to 
more  than  three  and  one-half  million  acres;  and  the 
population  increased  133  per  cent.  From  1830  to 
1840  the  population  was  doubled.  In  1833  the  Wa- 
bash &amp;  Erie  canal  was  commenced;  in  1834  the 
State  Bank  with  ten  branches  was  incorporated.  The 
result  of  these  undertakings  and  others  into  which 
the  State  entered  was  a  debt  of  over  $14,000,000  and 
a  general  bankruptcy  which  retarded  the  progress 
and  development  of  the  State.  In  1846  measures 
were  taken  to  pay  the  accumulated  interest'on  the 
State  debt;  in  1850  a  new  constitution  was  adopted, 
and  soon  the  whole  economy  of  the  State  was  changed 
and  prosperity  returned.  The  State  is  the  smallest 
of  the  Western  States,  having  an  area  of  33,809 
square  miles,  but  in  population  it  ranks  sixth  in  the 
members  of  the  Union.

T 


HE  Indian  tribes  resident  within  the  bounds  of 


whites  were  commenced  were  the  Miamis,  the  Shaw- 
nees,  the  Delawares,  the  Wyandots,  and  Pottawatto- 
mies.  The  Weas,  Eel  Rivers,  and  Piankashaws,  also 
found  in  the  State,  were  really  branches  of  the  Miamis. 
In  the  treaty  at  Greenville  Gen.  Wayne  recognized 
the  Weas  and  Eel  Rivers  as  distinct  tribes  from  the 
Miamis  in  order  that  they  might  receive  a  large 
share  of  the  money  which  was  stipulated  to  be  paid 
by  the  United  States.  Gen.  Wayne  thought  it  just 
that  the  Miamis  and  their  allied  tribes  should  receive 
more  of  the  annuities  promised  by  the  Government 
than  they  would  be  entitled  to  as  a  single  tribe, 
because  he  recognized  it  as  a  fact  that  the  country 
ceded  by  the  treaty  was  really  their  property.  The 
Indians  were  so  frequently  at  war  with  each  other 
and  so  often  moved  from  one  region  to  another  that 
it  is  difficult  to  locate  them  and  impossible  to  fix 
definite  bounds  to  their  possessions.  According  to 
the  map  of  Indiana  giving  the  Indian  names  of  rivers, 
towns,  etc.,  prepared  by  the  late  Daniel  Hough,  of 
Wayne  County,  and  published  in  the  Indiana  Geo- 
logical Report  of  1882,  the  northern  portion  of  the 
State  is  assigned  to  the  Pottawattomies;  the  Wabash 
and  Maumee  valleys  to  the  Miamis;  the  head-waters 
of  both  branches  of  White  River  to  the  Delawares; 
the  south-eastern  part  of  the  State  along  the  Ohio  to 
the  Shawnees,  and  west  of  them  the  Wyandots. 

Of  these  tribes  the  Miamis  were  at  one  time  by 
far  the  most  numerous  and  powerful.  Their  territory 
embraced  all  of  Ohio  west  of  the  Scioto,  all  of  Indi- 
ana and  part  of  Illinois.  They  had  numerous  villages 
on  the  Scioto,  the  head-waters  of  the  two  Miamis, 
the  Maumee  and  throughout  the  whole  course  of  the 
Wabash  as  far  down  as  the  town  of  Brushwood,  now 
Vincennes.  Before  the  arrival  of  the  whites  west  of 
the  mountains,  it  is  believed  that  the  Miamis  could 
assemble  a  larger  number  of  warriors  than  any  other 
aboriginal  nation  of  North  America.      The  ravages 


of  the  small-pox  had  largely  reduced  their  numbers 
before  the  commencement  of  the  Revolutionary  war. 

Little  Turtle,  the  famous  Miami  chief,  during 
the  negotiations  which  preceded  the  treaty  of  Green- 
ville, spoke  with  pride  and  yet  with  sadness  of  the 
former  greatness  and  dominion  of  his  tribe.  His 
words  are  preserved   in   the   Americau  State  Papers: 

"I  hope  you  will  pay  attention  to  what  I  now  say 
to  you.  You  have  pointed  out  to  us  the  boundary 
line  between  the  Indians  and  the  United  States;  but 
I  now  take  the  liberty  to  inform  you,  that  that  line 
cuts  off  from  the  Indians  a  large  portion  of  country 
which  has  been  enjoyed  by  my  forefathers  time 
immemorial,  without  molestation  or  dispute.  The 
prints  of  my  ancestor's  houses  are  everywhere  to  be 
seen  in  this  portion.  It  is  well  known  to  all  my 
brothers  present  that  my  forefather  kindled  the  first 
fire  at  Detroit;  from  thence  he  extended  his  lines  to 
the  head- waters  of  Scioto;  from  thence  to  its  mouth; 
from  thence  down  the  Ohio  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Wabash;  from  thence  to  Chicago  on  Lake  Michigan. 
At  this  place  I  first  saw  my  elder  brothers,  the 
Shawnees.  I  have  now  informed  you  of  the  bound- 
aries of  the  Miami  nation,  where  the  Great  Spirit 
placed  my  forefather  a  long  time  ago  and  charged 
him  not  to  sell  or  part  with  his  lands,  but  to  preserve 
them  for  his  posterity.  This  charge  has  been  handed 
down  to  me.  I  was  surprised  to  find  my  other 
brothers  differed  so  much  from  me  on  this  subject; 
for  their  conduct  would  lead  one  to  suppose  that  the 
Great  Spirit  and  their  forefathers  had  not  given 
them  the  charge  that  was  given  to  me;  but  on  the 
contrary  had  directed  them  to  sell  their  lands  to  any 
white  man  who  wore  a  hat,  as  soon  as  he  should  ask 
it  of  them." 

Little  Turtle  took  pride  in  the  antiquity  of  his 
race,  as  well  as  in  the  extent  of  territory  controlled 
by  his  ancestors.  In  1797  this  Miami  chief  met 
Volney  in  Philadelphia.  The  French  philosopher 
explained  to  the  savage  orator  the  theory  that  the

Indian  race  had  descended  from  the  dark-skinned 
Tartars,  and,  by  a  map,  showed  the  supposed  com- 
munication between  Asia  and  America.  Little  Tur- 
tle replied:  "Why  should  not  these  Tartars,  who 
resemble  us,  have  descended  from  the  Indians  ? ' ' 

INDIAN     VILLAGES. 

Long  before  the  first  settlements  of  the  English- 
speaking  whites  in  Indiana  the  habits  of  the  Indians 
had  been  modified  by  their  contact  with  the  Euro- 
peans. The  traders  had  supplied  them  with  fire- 
arms, Bcalping-knives  and  iron  tomahawks.  They 
had  iron  pots  and  brass  kettles  for  cooking  and  sugar 
making.  They  had  learned  to  like  strong  drink,  and 
were  given  to  great  excesses  in  eating  and  drinking. 
Many  of  the  inhabitants  of  some  of  their  more 
important  villages  were  French. 

The  Wea  Prairie  or  plains  a  few  miles  below  the 
mouth  of  Wea  Creek,  and  not  far  fi'om  the  site  of 
Lafayette,  contained  some  of  the  most  extensive 
improvements  ever  made  by  the  Indians  within  the 
limits  of  the  State.  On  the  opposite  side  of  the 
Wabash  was  the  Indian  town  Ouiatenon,  or  Wah-wee- 
ah-tenon  in  the  Indian  tongue.  When  it  was  de- 
stroyed by  Col.  Wilkinson  in  1791  he  found  there  a 
number  of  French  books,  letters  and  documents, 
showing  that  the  place  was  in  close  connection  with 
Detroit.  For  richness  of  soil  and  beauty  of  natural 
scenery  few  places  in  the  West  can  compare  with  the 
Wea  plains. 

The  town  of  Tippecanoe,  orKathtippaeamunck,  on 
the  north  side  of  the  Wabash,  at  the  mouth  of  the 
Tippecanoe,  was  also  a  celebrated  Indian  place.  In 
1791  the  village  consisted  of  about  120  houses, 
eighty  of  which  were  shingle-roofed.  The  best 
houses  belonged  to  the  French  traders,  whose  gardens 
and  improvements  round  the  town  are  described  as 
delightful,  and  indeed  not  a  little  wonderful.  There 
was  a  tavern  with  cellars,  bar  and  public  and  private 
rooms;  the  whole  was  marked  by  considerable  order, 
and  evinced  a  small  degree  of  civilization.  The 
town  of  the  Eel  River  tribe  was  scattered  along  the 
Eel  River  for  about  three  miles,  on  an  uneven  scrubby- 
oak  barren,  intersected  alternately  with  bogs  almost 
impenetrable,  and  impervious  thickets  of  plum,  hazel 
and  black-jack.  Col.  Wilkinson  found  the  head  chief 
at  this  place  guarding  a  number  of  prisoners  and 
families  at  work  digging  a  root  which  they  substi- 
tuted in  place  of  the  potato. 

INDIAN    AGEICULTURE. 

The  agriculture  of  the  Indians  in  Indiana,  as 
well  as  in  most  other  parts  of  North  America,  was 
confined  chiefly  to  the  growing  of  corn  and  beans,  to 
which  potatoes  were  afterward  added.     The  extent  of 


their  corn-fields  on  the  Wabash  and  the  Maumee  was 
greater  than  is  generally  supposed.  A  journal  of 
Gen.  Wayne's  campaign,  kept  by  George  Will,  under 
the  date  of  Augusts,  1791,  says:  "  We  have  marched 
four  or  five  miles  in  corn-fields  down  the  Auglaize, 
and  there  are  not  less  than  1,000  acres  of  corn 
around  the  town."  The  same  journal  describes  the 
immense  corn-fields,  numerous  vegetable  patches  and 
old  apple  trees  found  along  the  banks  of  the  Maumee 
from  its  mouth  to  Ft.  Wayne,  and  discloses  the  fact 
that  the  army  obtained  its  bread  and  vegetables  for 
eight  days,  while  building  Ft.  Defiance,  from  the 
surrounding  corn  and  potato  fields. 

One  of  the  chief  objects  of  the  military  expedi- 
tions against  the  Indian  villages  was  the  destruction 
of  their  corn,  which  would  compel  their  warriors  to 
devote  more  of  their  time  to  hunting  as  a  means  of 
subsistence,  and  thus  prevent  marauding  expeditions 
against  the  white  settlements.  Gen.  Harmar,  in  his 
unsuccessful  expedition  in  1790,  burned  and  destroyed 
nearly  20,000  bushels  of  corn  in  the  vicinity  of  Ft. 
Wayne.  Gen.  Charles  Scott,  in  his  expedition 
against  the  Wabash  Indians,  destroyed  a  considerable 
amount  of  corn  about  the  Ist  of  June,  1791.  In 
August  of  the  same  year  Col.  Wilkinson,  who 
marched  against  the  same  villages,  found  that  the 
Indians  had  re-planted  their  corn,  and  it  was  in  high 
cultivation,  several  fields  being  well  plowed.  Wil- 
kinson reported  that  besides  burning  a  respectable 
Kickapoo  village,  he  had  cut  down  at  least  430  acres 
of  corn,  chiefly  in  the  milk,  and  that  the  Indians,  left 
without  houses,  home  or  provisions,  must  cease  to  war, 
and  would  find  active  employment  in  subsisting  their 
squaws  and  children  during  the  coming  winter. 

MORAL  AND  INTELLECTUAL  CHARACTER. 

Gen.  William  H.  Harrison  speaks  of  the  moral 
and  intellectual  qualities  of  the  Indians  of  the  North- 
west in  his  discourse  before  the  Ohio  Historical  and 
Philosophical  Society  on  the  "Aboriginees  of  the 
Ohio  Valley,"  as  follows: 

"  The  Wyandots,  Delawares,  Shawnees  and  Mia- 
mis  were  much  superior  to  the  other  members  of  the 
confederacy.  The  Little  Turtle  of  the  Miami  tribe 
was  one  of  this  description,  as  was  the  Blue  Jacket, 
a  Shawnee  chief.  I  think  it  probable  that  Tecumseh 
possessed  more  integrity  than  any  other  of  the  chiefs 
who  attained  to  much  distinction;  but  he  violated  a 
solemn  engagement,  which  he  had  freely  contracted, 
and  there  are  strong  suspicions  of  his  having  formed 
a  treacherous  design,  which  an  accident  only  pre- 
vented him  from  accomplishing.  Similar  instances 
are,  however,  to  be  found  in  the  conduct  of  great  men 
in  the  history  of  almost  all  civilized  nations.  But 
these  instances  are  more  than  counterbalanced  by  the 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


27 


number  of  individuals  of  bigh  moral  character  which 
were  to  be  found  among  the  principal  and  secondarj 
chiefs  of  the  four  tribes  above  mentioned.  This  was 
particularly  the  case  with  Tarhe,  or  the  Crane,  the 
great  sachem  of  the  Wyandots,  and  Black  Hoof,  the 
chief  of  the  Shawnees.  Many  instances  might  be 
adduced  to  show  the  possession  on  the  part  of  these 
men  of  an  uncommon  degree  of  disinterestedness  and 
magnanimity,  and  strict  performance  of  their  engage- 
ments under  circumstances  which  would  be  consid" 
ered  by  many  as  justifying  evasion. 

' '  By  many  they  are  supposed  to  be  stoics,  who 
willingly  encounter  deprivations.  The  very  reverse 
is  the  fact.  If  they  belong  to  either  of  the  classes  of 
philosophers  which  prevailed  in  the  declining  ages 
of  Greece  and  Rome,  it  is  to  that  of  the  Epicureans. 
For  no  Indian  will  forego  an  enjoyment  or  suffer  an 
inconvenience  if  he  can  avoid  it,  but  under  peculiar 
circumstances,  when,  for  instance,  he  is  stimulated 
by  some  strong  passion.  But  even  the  gratification 
of  this  he  is  ready  to  postpone  whenever  its  accom- 
plishment is  attended  with  unlooked-for  danger  or 
unexpected  hardships.  Hence  their  military  opera- 
tions were  always  feeble,  their  expeditions  few  and 
far  between,  and  much  the  greater  number  abandoned 
without  an  efficient  stroke,  from  whim,  caprice,  or  an 
aversion  to  encounter  difficulties."  He  adds  : 
"When,  however,  evil  comes  which  he  cannot  avoid, 
then  he  will  call  up  all  the  spirit  of  the  man  and 
meet  his  fate,  however  hard,  like  the  best  Roman  of 
them  all." 

ANTOINE    GAMELIn's    MISSION. 

While  Gov.  St.  Clair  was  engaged  in  organizing 
the  western  counties  of  the  Northwest  Territory  in 
1790,  he  made  a  praiseworthy  effort  to  conciliate  the 
hostile  tribes  on  the  Wabash.  Antoine  Gamelin,  an 
intelligent  French  merchant  of  Vincennes,  was  em- 
ployed to  carry  the  messages  of  the  Government  to 
the  Indians,  and  to  acertain  their  disposition  and 
sentiments.  Antoine  traveled  across  the  State  and 
visited  all  the  tribes  along  the  Wabash  and  as  far 
east  as  the  junction  of  the  St.  Joseph  and  St.  Mary's, 
at  the  site  of  Fort  Wayne.  His  journal,  which  for- 
tunately has  been  preserved,  gives  much  information 
concerning  the  Indians  of  Indiana  in  the  earlier 
period  of  the  history  of  the  Northwest  Territory. 

Setting  out  from  Vincennes  on  April  5,  1790,  the 
first  Indian  village  he  arrived  at  was  called  Kicka- 
pougoi,  inhabited  by  a  tribe  then  peaceably  disposed 
toward  the  whites.  The  second  village  he  found  was 
at  tbe  river  Vermillion,  and  inhabited  by  the  Pian- 
keshaws,  who  looked  upon  the  Miamis  as  their  elder 
brei.hren,  and  could  not  give  an  answer  to  the  mes- 
sage until  they  had  consulted  that  nation.  On  the 
11th  of  April  Gamelin  arrived  at  a  tribe  of  the  Kick- 


apoos,  who  also  regarded  the  Miamis  as  their  elder 
brethren.  On  the  18th  he  arrived  at  Eel  River.  The 
village  of  Eel  River  Indians  stood  about  six  miles 
above  the  junction  of  that  stream  with  the  Wabash. 
The  chief  of  this  tribe  was  absent,  and  no  answer  to 
the  message  could  be  obtained.  On  the  23d  of  April 
he  arrived  at  the  great  village  of  the  Miamis,  at  the 
site  of  Fort  Wayne.  The  chief  of  the  Miamis  at  this 
time  was  called  LeGris.  At  this  place  were  both 
French  and  English  traders.  While  Gamelin  re- 
mained five  Pottawattomies  arrived  with  two  negro 
men,  whom  they  sold  to  the  English  traders.  Blue 
Jacket,  the  great  warrior  chief  of  the  Shawnees,  was 
at  the  Miami  town.  Both  LeGris  and  Blue  Jacket 
were  disposed  to  insist  that  the  Ohio  River  should  be 
made  the  Indian  boundary,  and  the  report  of  Gamelin 
was  unfavorable  for  the  maintenance  of  peace. 

INDIANS    DEMAND    THE    OHIO    FOR    THEIR    BOUNDARY. 

The  Indians  of  the  Wabash  and  Maumee  were 
hostile  to  the  formation  of  the  earlier  settlements 
northwest  of  the  Ohio,  and  made  incursions  upon  the 
whites  along  the  Ohio  in  what  is  now  the  State  of 
Ohio,  and  often  passed  into  Kentucky  on  expeditions 
of  plunder  and  murder.  These  Indians  were  united 
in  claiming  that  the  whites  had  no  rights  to  any  lands 
northwest  of  the  Ohio;  that  the  treaty  of  Fort  Stan- 
wix  in  1768  made  the  Ohio  River  the  boundary,  and 
they  refused  to  regard  the  treaties  of  Fort  Mackin- 
tosh in  1785,  and  Fort  Harmar  in  1789,  as  binding, 
because  not  satisfied  by  all  the  tribes. 

In  1793  President  Washington  instructed  the 
Commissioners  appointed  by  him  to  negotiate  a  treaty 
of  peace  with  the  Northwestern  Indians,  to  use  every 
effort  to  obtain  a  confirmation  of  the  boundary  line 
established  at  Fort  Harmar,  and  to  offer  in  payment 
$50,000  in  hand,  and  an  annuity  of  $10,000  forever. 
The  Indians  refused  the  money,  claimed  that  the 
treaties  already  made  were  void  because  not  sanc- 
tioned by  all  the  tribes,  demanded  that  the  Ohio 
River  should  be  considered  the  boundary,  and  that 
every  white  settlement  should  be  removed  from  the 
Northwest  Territory.  The  paper  containing  these 
views  of  the  Indians  was  signed  by  the  chiefs  of  the 
Wyandots,  Delawares,  Shawnees,  Miamis,  Mingoes 
Pottawattomies,  Ottawas,  Connoys,  Chippewas  and 
Munsees. 

The  Commissioners  explained  to  them  that  the 
United  States  Government  had  sold  large  tracts  of 
land  northwest  of  the  Ohio,  and  that  the  white  set- 
tlements and  improvements  were  numerous,  and  had 
cost  much  money  and  labor,  and  could  not  be  given 
up;  but  the  Government  was  willing  to  pay  a  larger 
sum  in  money  and  goods  than  had  been  given  at  any 
one  time  for  Indian  lands  since  the  whites  first  set

HISTORY    OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


their  feet  on  this  continent.  The  Indians  gave  as 
their  final  reply: 

"  Money  is  of  no  value  to  us,  and  to  most  of  us  is 
unknown.  As  no  consideration  whatever  can  induce 
us  to  sell  the  lands  on  which  we  get  sustenance  for 
our  women  and  children,  we  hope  we  may  be  allowed 
to  point  out  a  mode  by  which  your  settlers  may  be 
easily  removed,  and  peace  thereby  obtained. 

"  We  know  these  settlers  are  poor,  or  they  never 
would  have  ventured  to  live  in  a  country  which  has 
been  in  continual  trouble  since  they  crossed  the  Ohio. 
Divide,  therefoi-e,  this  large  sum  of  money  which 
you  have  offered  to  us  among  these  people.  Give  to 
each,  also,  a  proportion  of  virhat  you  say  you  will 
give  to  us  annually  over  and  above  this  large  sum  of 
money,  and,  we  are  persuaded,  they  will  most  readily 
accept  it  in  lieu  of  the  land  you  sold  them.  If  you 
add,  also,  the  great  sums  you  must  expend  in  raising 
and  paying  armies  with  a  view  to  force  us  to  yield 
you  our  country,  you  will  certainly  have  more  than 
sufficient  for  the  purpose  of  repaying  these  settlers 
for  all  their  labor  and  their  improvements. 

"  We  shall  be  persuaded  that  you  mean  to  do  us 
justice  if  you  agree  that  the  Ohio  shall  remain  the 
boundary  line  between  us.  If  you  will  not  consent 
thereto,  our  further  meeting  will  be  altogether  un- 
necessary." 

The  Commissioners  on  the  part  of  the  Grovernment 
said  "That  they  had  already  explicitly  declared  to 
them  that  it  was  now  impossible  to  make  the  Ohio 
River  the  line  between  their  lands  and  the  lands  of 
the  United  States.  Your  answer  amounts  to  a  decla- 
ration that  you  will  agree  to  no  other  boundary  than 
the  Ohio.     The  negotiation  is  therefore  at  an  end." 

Nothing  remained  for  the  Government  but  a  vig- 
orous prosecution  of  the  war.  The  Indians  were 
defeated  by  Gen.  Wayne  in  August,  1794,  and  in 
August,  1795,  a  treaty  of  peace  was  ratified  by  all 
the  tribes.  The  treaty  of  Greenville  was  the  first 
one  since  that  of  Fort  Stanwix,  which  was  regarded 
as  binding  upon  the  Indian  confederacy.  It  was 
observed  by  them  in  good  faith,  atid  there  was  no 
further  war  between  the  red  men  and  the  whites  until 
the  battle  of  Tippecanoe  in  1811. 

COL.  lochry's  disastrous  defeat. 
One  of  the  most  disastrous  battles  which  took  place 
on  the  soil  of  Indiana  was  the  surprise  and  defeat  of 
Col.  Archibald  Lochry  by  the  Indians,  on  August  24, 
1781.  Lochry  was  the  County  Lieutenant  of  West- 
moreland County,  Penn. ,  and  was  requested  by  Col. 
George  Rogers  Clark,  to  raise  a  military  force  in  the 
summer  of  1781,  and  to  join  him  in  a  movement  then 
contemplated  against  the  Indian  ti-ibes  of  the  North- 
west. Col.  Lochry  raised  a  force  of  107  mounted  men. 


and  on  the  25th  of  July  set  out  for  Fort  Henry,  at 
Wheeling,  where  they  expected  to  join  Col.  Clark. 
When  they  arrived  at  Wheeling  they  found  that  Clark 
had  proceeded  down  the  river,  leaving  directions  for 
Lochry  to  follow  him.  They  passed  down  the  river, 
and  on  August  24  reached  the  mouth  of  a  creek  which 
empties  into  the  Ohio  about  ten  miles  below  the  Great 
Miami.  This  stream  has  since  been  named  Lochry's 
Creek.  Here  was  an  attractive  spot,  and  the  Colonel 
ordered  the  boats  to  land  on  the  north  side  of  the 
Ohio.  The  horses  were  turned  loose  to  feed,  while 
some  of  the  mea  were  sent  out  to  cut  grass  for  the 
horses  on  their  way  to  Louisville.  Oue  of  the  party 
had  killed  a  buffalo,  and  all,  except  a  few,  who  were 
cutting  grass  ur  guarding  the  horses,  were  engaged 
round  the  fires,  which  they  had  kindled  for  cooking 
a  meal.  Suddenly  they  were  assailed  by  a  volley  of 
rifles  from  a  large  party  of  Indians.  The  men  seized 
their  guns  and  defended  themselves,  until  their  am- 
munition was  exhausted,  and  then  took  to  their  boats, 
when  they  were  fired  upon  by  another  party  of  Indi- 
ans in  canoes.  The  result  was  the  death  of  Lochry, 
and  forty- one  of  his  men.  The  whole  detachment  were 
either  killed  or  taken  prisoners;  not  one  escaped.  Some 
were  killed  after  being  taken  prisoners.  The  pris- 
oners were  taken  to  Canada,  and  were  not  set  at  lib- 
erty until  after  the  peace  of  1783.  Col.  Lochry's 
party  was  composed  of  the  best  men  of  the  Pennsyl- 
vania frontiers. 

TREATY  OF  FORT    FINNEY. 

Congress  resolved  in  March,  1785,  to  hold  a  treaty 
with  the  Indiana  of  the  Wabash  and  other  parts  of 
Indiana  at  Vincenneson  June  20,  1785.  The  place  of 
meeting  was  afterward  "changed  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Great  Miami,  where  a  temporary  work  of  defense  was 
erected  and  named  Fort  Finney.  The  representa- 
tives of  the  United  States  were  George  Rogers  Clark, 
Richard  Butler  and  Samuel  H.  Parsons.  Various 
circumstances  caused  the  time  of  the  negotiations  to 
be  changed  to  the  winter  of  1785-86.  The  Wabash 
Indians  refused  to  attend,  on  account  of  a  growing 
spirit  of  hostility.  Some  chiefs  and  warriors  of  the 
Shawnees  and  a  few  Delawares  and  Wyandots  finally 
met  the  Commissioners,  and  after  some  time  spent  in 
negotiations,  the  treaty  of  Fort  Finney  was  signed 
on  January  31,  1780.  The  United  States  stockade 
pending  the  deliberations,  mustered  seventy  men. 
There  were  present  some  300  of  the  finest  warriors  of 
the  Shawnees.  By  the  treaty  the  United  States  were 
acknowledged  to  be  the  sole  and  absolute  sovereigns 
of  all  the  territory  ceded  to  them  by  the  treaty  with 
Great  Britain  in  1784.  Hunting  grounds  lying 
chiefly  in  Indiana  were  allotted  the  Shawnees  as  fol- 
lows: 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


29 


"  The  United  States  do  allot  to  the  Shawnee 
nation,  lands  within  said  territory  to  live  and  hunt 
upon,  beginning  at  the  south  line  of  the  lands  allot- 
ted to  the  Wyandots  and  Delaware  nations,  at  the 
place  where  the  main  branch  of  the  Groat  Miami, 
which  falls  into  the  Ohio,  intersects  said  line;  then 
down  the  river  Miami  to  the  fort  of  that  river  next 
below  the  old  fort  which  was  taken  by  the  French  in 
one  thousand  seven  hundred  and  fifty- two;  thence 
due  west  to  the  river  De  La  Panae;  then  down  that 
river  to  the  river  Wabash;  beyond]which  lines  none  of 
the  citizens  of  the  United  States  shall  settle,  nor 
disturb  the  Shawnees  in  their  settlement  possession." 

The  treaty  failed  entirely  in  securing  peace,  as  the 
tribes  more  distant  than  the  Shawnees  were  in  no  way 
disposed  to  cease  their  incursions. 

GEN.  Clark's  expedition  aoainst  the  wabash  Indians. 

The  first  important  expedition  which  passed  over 
the  Territory  of  Indiana  against  the  Indians  was  the 
unsuccessful  one  of  George  Rogers  Clark  against  the 
Wabash  Indians  in  1786.  Many  depredations  had 
been  committed  in  Kentucky  by  marauding  bands 
crossing  the  Ohio,  plundering,  burning  and  scalping. 
The  bands  were  chiefly  from  the  Miamis  and  the  Wa- 
bash. Congress  having  failed  in  its  efforts  to  secure 
peace  with  the  Indians  by  the  treaty  at  Fort  Finney, 
ordered  two  companies  down  the  Ohio  to  the  Falls 
and  on  June  30,  1786,  authorized  the  raising  of  mill, 
tia  in  Kentucky  for  the  invasion  of  the  country  of  the 
hostile  tribes.  The  expedition  was  organized  into  two 
parties,  one  under  Gen.  Clark  to  march  against  the 
upper  Wabash  country;  the  other  under  Col.  Benjam- 
in Logan  was  to  proceed  against  the  villages  on  the 
head-waters  of  the  Great  Miami. 

Col.  Logan,  with  400  or  500  mounted  rifle-men, 
crossed  the  Ohio  near  Maysville,  Ky.,  and  passing 
northward  succeeded  in  destroying  some  Indian  vil- 
lages in  what  is  now  Logan  County,  Ohio,  killing 
about  twenty  savages  and  taking  about  seventy  pris- 
oners. 

Gen.  Clark  was  not  so  successful.  With  about 
1,000  men  he  marched  from  the  Falls  of  the  Ohio  for 
Vincennes  and  arrived  near  that  place  in  October.  His 
supplies  were  to  be  forwarded  to  that  place  by  boats. 
Nine  boats  had  been  freighted  with  stores  to  descend 
the  Ohio  to  the  mouth  of  the  Wabash  and  then  to  as. 
cend  to  Vincennes.  The  low  state  of  the  water  re. 
tarded  the  arrival  of  the  boats.  The  army  lay  en 
camped  awaiting  the  arrival  of  provisions.  Day  after 
day  passed.  One  thousand  hungry  men  consume  much 
food.  The  men  were  put  on  short  allowance.  Many 
became  restless  and  mutinous.  At  last,  after  waiting 
nine  days,  the  boats  arrived.  But  to  their  disappoint- 
ment the  meat  was  found   to  be  spoiled  by  the  hot 


weather.  There  were  sound  rations  only  for  three 
days,  and  there  was  a  march  before  them  of  200  miles- 
The  mutinous  spirit  became  more  apparent.  Gen. 
Clark  urged  an  immediate  and  rapid  advance.  The 
Kentucky  volunteers  were  re-enforced  by  a  number  of 
the  inhabitants  of  Vincennes  and  the  army  started  on 
its  march  up  the  Wabash.  On  reaching  the  mouth  of 
the  Vermillion  it  was  found  that  the  Indians  had  de- 
serted their  villages  on  that  stream.  Disappointment, 
hunger  and  fatigue  now  led  to  open  mutiny  and  300 
men  with  some  officers  of  high  rank  mounted  their 
horses  and  left  for  their  homes.  Neither  the  com- 
mands, the  entreaties  nor  the  tears  of  the  command- 
ing General  could  avail.  Nothing  was  left  to  Clark 
but  the  abandonment  of  the  expedition.  With  the 
remainder  of  his  half-starved  men,  the  unfortunate 
commander  worked  his  way  back  to  the  Falls,  covered 
with  shame  and  confusion.  This  was  the  last  expedi- 
tion of  the  brilliant  military  genius,  George  Rogers 
Clark  and  the  first  one  which  resulted  unfortunately. 

GEN.    CHARLES    SCOTt's    EXPEDITION. 

In  January,  1791,  President  Washington  laid  be- 
fore Congress  his  views  of  the  proper  measures  for 
protecting  the  wegtern  settlements  from  Indian  depre- 
dations. He  expressed  a  very  decided  opinion  that 
another  campaign  against  the  Wabash  Indians  was 
indispensable.  These  tribes  were  estimated  at  1,100 
warriors,  to  which  were  to  be  added  1,000  belonging  to 
more  distant  tribes.  The  President  held  that,  although 
winter  imposed  peace  at  that  time,  unless  the  attention 
of  the  tribes  was  directed  to  their  own  country,  they 
would  spi-ead  desolation  over  the  frontier  on  the  open- 
ing of  spring.  Congress  authorized  the  President  to 
raise  an  army  of  3,000  men,  to  be  placed  under  the 
command  of  Gov.  St.  Clair,  who  was  appointed  a 
Major-General,  and  also  a  corps  of  Kentucky  volun- 
teers for  the  purpose  of  a  rapid  march  and  immediate 
attack  on  the  Wabash.  This  corps  was  placed  under 
the  command  of  Gen.  Charles  Scott. 

On  the  23d  of  May,  1791,  Gen.  Scott,  with  a 
force  of  about  800  mounted  men,  crossed  the  Ohio  at 
the  mouth  of  the  Kentucky  and  commenced  his  march 
for  the  Wea  towns.  They  pressed  forward  with  the 
utmost  celerity,  but  the  rain  fell  in  torrents  and  wore 
down  their  horses  and  injured  their  provisions.  The 
country  was  intersected  and  made  rough  by  four 
branches  of  the  White  River  and  other  smaller 
streams,  many  of  them  having  steep  and  muddy 
banks.  On  the  31st  of  May  they  had  made  135 
miles  from  the  Ohio.  On  June  1,  at  a  distance  of 
150  miles  from  the  Ohio,  they  came  in  sight  of  two 
small  villages  on  their  left,  at  a  distance  of  two  and 
four  miles  respectively,  the  main  town  being  about 
five  miles  in  front.     The  General  sent  a  detachment 


30 


HISTORY   OF  PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


under  Col.  Hardin  to  attack  the  villages  on  the  left, 
while  he  pressed  forward  rapidly  toward  the  main 
town  in  front.  When  the  main  army  arrived  at  an 
eminence  overlooking  the  villages  on  the  Wabash, 
the  enemy  were  discovered  in  great  confusion  cross- 
ing the  river  in  canoes,  having  been  apprised  of  the 
approach  of  the  whites  by  one  of  their  warriors  who 
had  seen  them  on  the  preceding  day.  All  the  sav- 
ages in  live  canoes  were  destroyed  by  a  well-directed 
tire.  The  Wabash,  at  that  point,  was  too  high  to  be 
forded,  and  the  Indians  kept  up  a  vigorous  tire  from 
the  Kickapoo  towns  on  the  opposite  bank.  Two  com- 
panies passed  down  the  river  and  crossed  over  and 
drove  the  enemy  from  the  Kickapoo  village.  In  the, 
meantime,  Col.  Hardin  successfully  executed  the 
order  to  take  the  villages  on  the  left.  He  also  dis- 
covered a  third  and  stronger  village  which  he  also 
captured,  and  joined  his  commander  before  sunset, 
having  killed  six  warriors  and  taken  fifty-two  pris. 
oners.  The  next  day  Col.  Wilkinson,  with  360  men, 
marched  to  the  Tippecanoe  village,  which  he  took 
and  destroyed,  together  with  a  large  quantity  of 
corn,  peltry  and  furniture.  On  the  same  day,  the 
Wea  and  Kickapoo  towns  were  burned,  and  the  gal- 
lant army  reached  the  Ohio  on  the  14th  of  June,  hav- 
ing accomplished  the  great  object  of  their  expedition 
without  the  loss  of  a  single  man  killed  and  only  four 
wounded,  and  having  killed  thirty-two  of  the  savages 
and  taken  fifty-two  prisoners.  The  General  testified 
that  not  a  single  a(!t  of  inhumanity  had  marked  the 
conduct  of  his  men. 

COL.  JAMES  Wilkinson's  expedition. 

The  expedition  of  Gen.  Scott  having  been  suc- 
cessful, on  the  recommendation  of  Gen.  St.  Clair,  the 
Kentucky  Board  of  War  resolved  to  organize  another 
without  loss  of  time  to  destroy  the  Eel  River  towns. 
This  expedition  was  placed  under  the  command  of 
Col.  James  Wilkinson.  .  On  July  20  Col.  Wilkinson 
reported  to  Gov.  St.  Clair  at  Fort  Washington  with 
525  men  well  mounted  and  equipped.  The  march 
began  from  Cincinnati  on  August  1.  They  took  with 
them  provisions  for  thirty  days.  Instead  of  taking 
the  direct  course  toward  the  Eel  River  villages,  in 
order  to  mislead  the  enemy,  the  army  directed  its 
course  toward  the  site  of  Fort  Wayne.  The  hunting 
grounds  of  the  Indians  in  the  southwest  part  of  In- 
diana, and  the  most  common  paths  traveled  by  them 
were  thus  avoided.  For  three  days  the  northwardly 
course  was  pursued.  After  about  seventy  miles  from 
Cincinnati  had  been  made,  their  course  was  turned 
northwestward.  On  the  6th  they  captured  a  Dela- 
ware living  on  the  Maumee.  On  the  7th  the  army 
reached  the  Wabash  near  the  mouth  of  Eel  River. 


The  troops  crossed  the  river  and  charged  upon   the 
town.      The  enemy  being  completely  surprised,  was 
unable  to  make  the  least  resistance;  sis  of  their  war- 
riors were  killed    and    thirty- four    prisoners   taken. 
Unfortunately    in  the   hurry   and    confusion   of    the 
charge,  two  Indian  women  and  one  child  were  killed. 
A  white  captive   in  the  village  was  released.      The 
whites  lost  but  two  men  killed  and  one  wounded.      The 
next   day  the  corn   was   cut   down    and   the   cabins 
burned.       Col.  Wilkinson  then  took    up    his    march 
toward  the  Kickapoo  towns  in  the  prairie,  by  way  of 
the  Tippecanoe  village.      Reaching  the  latter  place, 
which  had  been  destroyed  by  Gen.   Scott  in  the  pre- 
ceding   June,   it    was  found    that    the    Indians    had 
replanted  their  corn  and  beans.      These  were  again 
cut   down.        While    at    this    place    the    commander 
learned    of  some  murmuring  and  discontent   among 
his   men,  growing   out  of    a  reluctance   to   proceed 
further  in  the  enemy's  country.      This  induced  him 
to  examine  the  state  of  the  horses   and    provisions, 
when  he  learned  to  his  mortification  that  270  horses 
were  lame  and  jaded,  and  barely  five  days'  provisions 
left  for  the  men.     Most  reluctantly  was  the  Colonel 
compelled  to  abandon  his  design  against  the  Kicka- 
poos  of   the  prairie.      He,   however,  marched  against 
a  village  of  the  same  tribe,  about  three  leagues  west. 
This  town,  consisting   of    about  thirty   houses,    was 
destroyed,  with  a  considerable  quantity  of  corn  in  the 
milk.      On  their  homeward  march  the  army  fell  into 
Gen.  Scott's  homeward  trace,  and  arrived  at  the  Falls 
of   the  Ohio  on  August  21.      The  men   were  mostly 
Kentucky  volunteers,  and  great  praise  was   awarded 
by  the  commander  to  the  whole  detachment.      Their 
entire  march  from  Cincinnati  to  the  Indian  towns, 
and  then  to  the  Falls,  was  by  accurate  computation 
451  miles,  and  was  accomplished  in  twenty-one  days. 
Among  the  prisoners  taken  by  Col.   Wilkinson  were 
the  sons  and  sisters  of  the  king  of  Ouiatenon  nation. 


GEN.    JOSIAH    HARMAR  S    EXPEDITION. 

The  largest  and  most  important  expeditions  against 
the  Indians  of  the  Northwest  Territory  were  directed 
against  the  Miami  towns  at  and  near  the  junction  of 
the  St.  Mary  and  St.  Joseph,  where  they  form  the 
Maumee.  The  region  about  the  site  of  Fort  Wayne 
was  probably  more  thickly  populated  with  savages 
than  any  other  in  Indiana.  The  junction  of  the 
rivers  was  the  site  of  an  old  and  important  town  of 
the  Miami  tribe.  The  importance  as  a  strategic 
point  of  the  site  of  Fort  Wayne  struck  Washington's 
sagacious  mind,  and  one  of  the  objects  of  the  cam- 
paigns on  the  Maumee  was  to  establish  here  a  fort 
which  was  to  be  connected  by  intermediate  stations 
with  Fort  Washington  at  Cincinnati.

HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

The  first  of  these  campaigns  was  under  the  com- 
mand of  Gen.  Josiah  Harmar.  He  marched  from 
Cincinnati  in  September,  1790,  by  a  circuitous  route, 
which  he  was  told  by  guides  was  the  shortest  and 
best  to  the  head  of  the  Maumee.  He  had  in  all 
about  1,300  men,  three-fourths  of  whom  were  raw 
militia,  badly  armed  and  equipped.  They  were  badly 
supplied  with  axes  and  camp-kettles;  their  arms 
were  largely  out  of  repair  and  almost  useless;  many 
muskets  being  brought  in  without  locks  with  the 
expectation  of  being  repaired  in  camp.  Many  of  the 
militia  were  substitutes  unused  to  lire-arms,  who  at 
the  first  sight  of  the  Indians  threw  down  their  arms 
and  ran.  On  October  13,  the  army  being  within 
about  thirty  miles  of  the  site  of  Fort  Wayne,  Col. 
John  Harding,  with  600  militia  men  and  one  com- 
pany of  regulars,  was  sent  forward  to  surprise  the 
enemy  and  keep  them  in  their  forts  until  the  main 
body  with  artillery  would  come  up.  On  reaching  the 
villages,  however,  they  were  found  deserted.  On  the 
17th  the  main  body  arrived,  and  five  or  six  towns 
were  destroyed  and  about  20,000  bushels  of  corn  in 
the  ear  cut  down.  On  the  2l8t  the  army  started  on 
its  homeward  march.  Unfortunately,  on  the  next  day 
it  was  resolved  that  Col.  Harding,  with  a  detachment 
of  340  militia  and  sixty  regulars,  should  return  to 
the  burned  villages  on  the  supposition  that  the  In- 
dians had  returned  thither.  They  succeeded  in  find- 
ing the  Indians  early  the  next  morning.  A  severe 
engagement  ensued;  the  savages  fought  with  bravery. 
The  troops  were  defeated,  many  of  the  militia  and 
most  of  the  regulars  being  killed.  Dispirited  by  this 
misfortune  and  dissensions  among  his  officers,  Har- 
mar returned  to  Cincinnati.  The  expedition  is 
known  as  Harmar's  defeat.  In  its  purpose  of  intim- 
idating the  Indians  it  was  entirely  unsuccessful,  but 
in  its  object  of  destroying  the  Miami  villages  it  was 
completely  successful;  the  towns  were  taken  and  300 
houses  and  wigwams  burned  without  the  loss  of  an 
American  soldier.  The  subsequent  efforts  to  defeat 
the  savages  in  battle  were  unsuccessful.  The  Indians 
looked  upon  the  expedition  as  a  failure  and  defeat 
and  it  was  followed  by  vigorous  efforts  on  their  part 
to  harass  and  break  up  the  American  settlements.  To 
carry  out  their  purposes  more  effectually,  Little 
Turtle,  chief  of  the  Miamis,  Blue  Jacket,  chief  of 
the  Shawnees,  and  Buckongahelas,  chief  of  the  Del- 
awares,  engaged  in  forming  a  confederacy  strong 
enough  to  drive  the  whites  beyond  the  Ohio. 


ST.     CLAIB  S    DEFEAT. 

The  unfortunate  expedition  of  Gen.  St.  Clair  was 
organized  during  the  year  1791.  He  was  instructed 
by  the  War  Department  to  march  for  the  village  at 
the  head  of  the  Maumee  in  order  to  establish  a  strong 
and  permanent  military  post  at  that  place,  and  to 
establish  such  posts  of  communication  between  that 
place  and  Fort  Washington  as  he  should  judge  proper. 
"The  establishment  of  such  a  post"  said  the  Secre- 
tary of  War,  "  is  considered  as  an  important  object 
of  the  campaign,  and  is  to  take  place  at  all  events." 
On  September  17  St.  Clair,  with  about  2,300  men, 
marched  from  Ludlow's  Station,  near  Cincinnati.  On 
November  3  the  army  arrived  at  a  creek  running  to 
the  southwest,  and  which  was  supposed  to  be  the  St. 
Mary's,  one  of  the  principal  branches  of  the  Maumee, 
but  was  afterward  found  to  be  a  branch  of  the  Wabash. 
Early  on  the  morning  of  November  4,  the  army  was 
surprised  and  met  with  a  most  disastrous  defeat.  Of 
the  1,500  men  engaged  in  the  battle  more  than  half 
were  either  killed  or  wounded.  It  was  the  greatest 
calamity  to  the  disheartened  and  greatly  harassed 
pioneers  of  the  Northwest  Territory,  and  the  most  dis- 
astrous defeat  of  the  Americans  by  the  Indians.  The 
battle  occurred  near  the  Indiana  line  in  Mercer 
County,  Ohio,  the  battle-field  being  afterward  known 
as  Fort  Recovery. 

Wayne's  victory. 
Immediately  after  the  defeat  the  Federal  Govern- 
ment took  steps  to  raise  another  large  army  to  oper- 
ate against  'the  hostile  tribes.  Nearly  three  years 
passed,  however,  before  the  confederated  hostile  tribes 
were  met  by  Gen.  Anthony  Wayne,  whose  army  num- 
bered more  than  3,000  men,  well  disciplined  and 
finely  officered,  1,600  being  mounted  volunteer  troops 
from  Kentucky  commanded  by  Gen.  Charles  Scott,  of 
that  State.  Wayne's  decisive  victory  occurred  August 
20,  1794,  near  the  Maumee  rapids  in  Wood  County, 
Ohio.  The  battle  is  known  as  the  battle  of  the 
Fallen  Timbers,  though  sometimes  called  the  battle 
of  the  Maumee.  Had  not  the  Indians  apprised  of 
the  approach  of  the  armies  of  St.  Clair  and  Wayne  gone 
forth  from  their  principal  villages  to  meet  them,  the 
disastrous  defeat  of  the  one  and  the  decisive  victory 
of  the  other  would  have  taken  place  on  the  soil  of 
Indiana  and  not  of  Ohio.  Cessation  of  the  long  and 
bloody  Indian  war  followed  Wayne's  victory,  and  a 
peace  was  secured  which  continued  unbroken  until 
the  battle  of  Tippecanoe  sixteen  years  later.

PIONEER  HISTORY. 


THE  DAWN  OF  CIVILIZATION  UPON,  AND  FIRST  SETTLEMENT  OF  THE  WHITEWATER  VALLET— POSITION  OF  THE 
LANDS  OF  THE  COUNTY— JOHN  AND  WILLIAM  CONNER  AND  OTHER  EARLY  SETTLERS— PIONEER  LIFE- 
FRIENDLY  AND  HOSTILE  INDIANS. 


aENERALLY  speaking,  from  the  east  and  south 
upward  marched  the  van  of  civilization  to  the 
fertile  valleys  and  beautiful  hills  of  the  Whitewater 
country,  explorers  and  immigrants  coming  from  the 
direction  of  the  Miami  country,  Cincinnati,  Harrison 
and  Lawrenceburg. 

John  Gleves  Symmes  had  landed  at  North  Bend 
on  the  Ohio  early  in  the  year  1789,  and  in  1795 
several  families  had  settled  on  the  site  of  Lawrence- 
burw,  and  a  small  settlement  had  been  made  at  Arm- 
strong's Station,  in  Clark  County.  Cincinnati  was 
laid  out  in  1789;  Hamilton,  at  Fort  Hamilton  in  1794; 
Dayton  in  1795  and  in  the  spring  of  the  following 
year  permanent  settlements  commenced. 

Gen.  Wayne's  victory  over  the  Indians,  August 
20,  1794,  put  a  check  to  their  depredations  but  did 
not  at  once  reduce  them  to  absolute  submission.  In 
March,  1795,  one  man  was  killed  and  eight  horses 
stolen  in  the  village  of  North  Bend.  The  treaty  of 
peace  at  Greenville,  concluded  August  3,  1795,  put 
an  end  to  the  murder  of  white  men  by  Indians  in  the 
Miami  country  and  was  signalized  by  rapid  immigra- 
tion thither  and  opened  the  way  for  further  explora- 
tion and  immigration  to  the  territory  of  eastern  and 
southern  Indiana. 

It  is  not  improbable  that  the  Whitewater  Valley 
was  as  early  explored  as  the  division  to  which  it  be- 
longs. It  is  a  matter  of  record  that  from  1796  to 
1799  many  settlers  had  established  themselves 
throughout  Dearborn  County. 

The  Rev.  Allen  Wiley,  one  of  the  pioneer  preach- 
ers of  the  Whitewater  country,  and  well  known  to 
many  of  the  pioneers  yet  living  in  this  section,  in 
1845-46  wrote  a  series  of  articles  which  appeared  in 
the  Western  Christian  Advocate  published  in  Cincin- 
nati, titled  "  Introduction  and  Progress  of  Method- 
ism in  Southeastern  Indiana."  Mr.  Wiley  was  a 
man  of  unusually  large  experience  and  knowledge  of 
the  people  and  times  whereof  he  wrote.  He  says: 
"In  the  autumn  of  1804  my  father  came  to  Indiana 
and  settled  aboi;t  three  miles  above  where  Harrison 
now  stands,  I  being  then  in  my  sixteenth  year.  The 
country  was  then  somewhat  densely  settled  along  the 


river  up  to  what  was  called  the  Lower  Narrows,  six 
or  seven  miles  above  where  Whitewater  leaves  Indi- 
ana. As  well  as  I  remember  there  was  one  family 
on  the  southwest  side  of  the  river  opposite  the  before 
mentioned  narrows;  another  family  on  the  same  side 
opposite  the  narrows  above  the  present  town  of  New 
Trenton,  and  another  on  the  same  side  in  the  bottom 
below  the  present  town  of  Rochester,  now  Cedar 
Grove.  Three-quarters  of  a  mile  above  Big  Cedar 
Grove  Creek,  Mr.  John  Conner,  an  Indian  trader, 
had  a  store  kept  by  a  Frenchman,  hence  the  store  was 
called  the  '  French  store.' 

"I  have  now  gone  to  the  ultima  thule  or  verge  of 
the  white  population  in  the  Whitewater  Valley  in 
1804.  There  were  a  few  families  on  Johnson's  Fork. 
In  the  spring  of  1805  two  settlements  were  formed  on 
the  Bast  Fork  of  Whitewater;  the  one  a  little  north  of 
the  town  of  Richmond,  in  Wayne  County,  was  called 
the  Kentucky  settlement,  because  most  of  the  families 
were  from  Kentucky;  the  other  was  some  distance 
above  the  town  of  Brookville,  near  where  Fairfield 
now  stands,  and  was  called  the  Carolina  settlement 
because  the  most  of  the  families  were  from  South 
Carolina.  The  same  spring  Mr.  William  Tyner,  a 
Baptist  minister,  settled  about  one  and  one-half  miles 
below  Brookville  and  Mr.  Thomas  Williams  one  mile 
above  on  the  south  side  of  West  Fork.  At  that  time  I 
presume  the  land  on  which  the  flourishing  town  of 
Brookville  now  stands  was  the  property  of  the  Gov- 
ernment. At  the  period  of  which  I  now  write  (1805) 
the  only  mill  for  all  the  upper  Whitewater  country 
was  on  the  edge  of  Ohio,  owned  by  Mr.  Thomas  Smith, 
of  Kentucky,  so  that  the  Kentucky  settlement  had  to 
travel  some  fifty  miles  to  mill,  and  the  Carolina  set- 
tlers twenty-five.  Sometimes,  perhaps,  the  former 
went  across  through  the  wilderness  to  Four  and  Seven 
Mile  Creeks,  near  the  Great  Miami,  because  they  were 
some  nigher." 

Of  the  two  settlements  referred  to  by  Mr.  Wiley 
the  "  Carolina  Colony"  was  composed  of  the  following 
named  heads  of  families:  Robert  Hanna,  Sr.,  John 
Templeton,  George  Leviston,  William  Logan,  Joseph 
Hanna,  John  Ewing  and  Robert  Swan.     These  fam-

ilies  as  early  as  the  year  1801  had  settled  on  the  Dry 
Fork  of  Whitewater  River,  near  Harrison,  and  there 
remained  until  the  spring  of  1805.  However,  in  the 
meantime  the  male  members  of  the  families  had  ex 
plored  the  country  along  East  Fork,  and  doubtless 
elsewhere  and  determined  upon  the  sites  of  their 
future  homes.  Then  returning  to  their  families  on 
Dry  Fork,  there  remained  until  the  summer  or  fall  of 
1804. 

These  families  were  nearly  all  related,  and  the 
party  was  under  the  leadership  of  Robert  Templeton 
and  Robert  Hanua.  In  the  summer  or  fall  of  1804 
they  started  for  the  Whitewater  region,  their  route 
being  a  "blazed"  one  and  was  ever  afterward  known 
as  the  "Carolina  Trace."  The  first  of  the  cabins 
built  is  believed  to  have  been  the  one  subsequently 
occupied  by  Robert  Templeton  and  family  and  was 
located  in  Fairfield  Township,  Franklin  County. 
Nine  cabins  were  built  extending  along  East  Fork 
through  what  are  now  Fairfield  Township  in  Franklin 
County  and  Harmony  and  Liberty  Townshijas  in 
Union  County.  The  cabins  were  occupied  in  the 
spring  of  1805. 

Concerning  the  Kentucky  settlement  Mr.  A.  W. 
Young,  author  of  the  "History  of  Wayne  County," 
published  in  1872  writes:  "In  the  year  1805  the  first 
settlement  of  white  men  on  the  banks  of  Whitewater 
was  commenced  and  the  first  rude  cabin  built.  In  the 
spring  of  that  year  George  Holeman,  Richard  Rue 
and  Thomas  McCoy,  with  their  families,  from  Ken- 
tucky, settled  about  two  miles  south  of  where  Rich- 
mond now  stands.  Rue  and  Holeman  had  served 
under  Gen.  Clark  in  his  Indian  campaigns  several 
years  before  the  formation  of  the  Northwestern  Ter- 
ritory under  the  ordinance  of  1787.  Both  had  been 
captured  by  the  Indians  and  held  as  prisoners  about 
three  years  and  a  half.  Both  also  lived  on  the  lands 
on  which  they  settled  until  their  deaths,  far  advanced 
in  age.  Rue  was  the  first  Justice  of  the  Peace  in  this 
part  of  the  country. 

'\Holeman  and  Rue  selected  and  entered  their  lands 
late  in  1804,  at  Cincinnati,  on  their  way  home. 
Early  in  the  winter  they  retiu'ned  to  build  cabins  for 
their  families,  bringing  with  them,  on  their  horses,  such 
tools  as  were  necessary  in  that  kind  of  architecture, 
and  a  few  cooking  utensils.  Holeman's  two  eldest  sons, 
Joseph  and  William,  then  about  eighteen  and  sixteen 
years  of  age,  accompanied  their  father,  to  assist  in 
his  initiatory  pioneer  labor.  In  a  very  few  days  two 
cabins  were  ready  for  occupancy.  Rue  and  Holeman, 
leaving  the  boys  to  take  care  of  themselves,  started 
again  for  Kentucky  to  bring  their  families." 

In  1879  William  McClure,  whose  father,  coming 
from  Kentucky,  settled  near  Cleves  in  1804,  said: 

"I  learned  from  Capt.  Isaac  Fuller,  of  this  county, 


(Franklin),  that  his  father  lived  as  early  as  1794  or 
1795  at  North  Bend  and  in  the  Big  Bottom,  and  that 
he  helped  to  raise  the  first  patch  of  corn  that  was  ever 
raised  by  white  men  in  the  Big  Bottom.  He  also  told 
me  he  had  a  brother  about  sixteen  years  of  age  taken 
by  the  Indians  from  North  Bend,  about  1795.  He 
had  been  sent  after  the  cows.  The  Indians  decoyed 
him  by  using  a  bell.  His  father  alone  followed  them 
to  near  Brookville,  and  stayed  all  night  on  the  place 
on  which  1  now  live,  and  watched  the  movements  of 
the  Indians,  but  was  unable  to  effect  his  son's  release. 
The  Indians  took  him  to  the  Upper  Wabash  country 
and  he  remained  with  them  about  two  years.  He  was 
left  by  his  master  at  the  camp  with  the  squaws,  with 
directions  what  to  do,  but  after  the  Indians  left,  one 
of  the  squaws,  a  half-sister  of  the  celebrated  Tecum, 
seh,  ordered  him  to  work  at  something  else,  which  he 
refused  to  do,  when  she  tried  to  kill  him.  He  kept 
out  of  her  way  for  the  time,  believing  she  would  kill 
him  if  she  had  an  opjjortunity.  Soon  after  he  went 
with  her  fishing,  and  watching  an  opportunity,  he 
struck  her  with  a  club  on  the  back  of  the  head  and 
knocked  her  into  a  deep  hole  of  water,  where  he  sup- 
posed she  was  drowned.  Then  he  struck  out  for 
Detroit,  where  he  arrived  in  about  a  week,  subsisting 
himself  as  best  he  could,  being  followed  by  the  In- 
dians all  the  way,  whom  he  succeeded  in  eluding. 
After  he  arrived  in  Detroit  he  found  a  friend,  who 
secreted  him  for  a  day  or  two,  until  the  Indians 
ceased  hunting  for  him,  when  he  conveyed  him  over 
to  Maldon,  on  the  Canada  side  of  the  Detroit  River, 
from  which  place  he  went  to  Buflfalo,  N.  Y. ,  and  from 
there  he  went  home  through  New  York  and  Pennsyl- 
vania, and  down  the  Ohio  River." 

As  many  of  the  early  settlers  of  Fayette  County 
had  first  settled  in  what  is  now  Franklin  County  and 
territory  further  south  and  subsequently  removed 
further  north  and  settled  permanently,  we  will  give 
the  names  of  some  common  to  both  counties. 

As  early  as  1802  or  1803  on  Dry  Fork  lived  the 
Athertons;  in  1804,  the  Cottons  near  Harrison;  at 
Harrison  and  below,  the  Cooleys,  Aliens  and  the 
Backhouses;  above  Harrison,  John  Caldwell  and  the 
Eads;  further  north  were  the  Hacklemans,  the  Mc- 
Cartys  and  Adairs;  about  New  Trenton  in  1807  lived 
the  Rockefellars,  and  in  the  vicinity  settled  early  the 
Brownlees;  the  Higgs  and  Blades  settled  early  on 
Blue  Creek. 

POSITION    OF    THE    LANDS    OF     THE    COUNTY. 

The  lands  of  Fayette  County  are  composed  of  two 
distinct  tracts  ceded  to  the  United  States  Government 
by  as  many  different  treaties.  What  is  known  as  the 
"  Twelve-Mile  Boundary  Line  "  is  a  line  which  begins 
at  Fort  Recovery,  in  Ohio,  extending  thence  in  a  due 


36 


HISTOKY   OP  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


southwesterly  direction  until  it  arrives  at  a  point 
twelve  miles  distant  from  the  "  Indian  Boundary 
Line,"  thence  parallel  with  said  "Indian  Boundary 
Line,"  until  it  intersects  the  Grouseland  Boundary 
Line  at  a  point  a  little  west  of  the  southwest  corner 
of  Franklin  County.  This  boundary  was  established 
by  a  treaty  held  at  Fort  Wayne  in  1809. 

This  line  passes  through  Fayette  County,  entering 
it  at  a  point  in  the  northeast  corner  of  Posey  Town- 
ehip,  passing  in  a  southwesterly  direction  and  out  of 
the  county  at  a  point  in  the  southeastern  corner  of 
Orange  Township.  The  lands  of  the  county  lying  east 
of  this  boundary  are  in  the  "  Twelve-Mile  Purchase," 
and  were  surveyed  and  ready  for  market  in  1811. 
The  lands  lying  west  of  the  boundary  are  in  what  is 
known  as  the  "New  Purchase,"  which  was  ceded  to  the 
United  States  Government  by  a  treaty  concluded  at  St. 
Mary's,  Ohio,  October  3,  1818.  These  land  were  not 
surveyed  and  ready  for  market  until  1820.  The 
greater  portion  of  the  territory  of  the  county  lies 
within  the  "Twelve-Mile  Purchase."  The  land 
office  for  the  sale  of  the  "  Twelve- Mile  Purchase  " 
was  located  at  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  while  that  of  the 
New  Purchase  was  situated  at  Brookville,  Ind, 

JOHN    AND  WILLIAM    CONNER,    AND  OTHER    EARLY    SETTLERS. 

It  is  our  belief  that  no  account  of  the  first  settle- 
ment made  within  the  present  limits  of  Fayette  County 
has  ever  been  given  to  print,  and  if  narrated  the  lips 
from  whence  it  came  have  long  since  been  sealed  and 
the  parties  to  whom  given  have  taken  their  final 
sleep,  and  none  live  to-day  to  satisfactoi'ily  present 
it.  There  is,  however,  little  doubt  but  that  the  trad- 
ing-post established  by  John  Conner  (or  possibly  by 
both  of  the  Conners)  on  the  present  site  of  the  city 
bearing  his  name,  marked  the  first  white  man's  cabin 
and  from  it  gleamed  forth  the  first  ray  of  civilization 
from  the  surrounding  wild  forests  of,  perhaps,  four 
score  years  ago. 

In  1788  or  thereabouts  there  resided  in  the  State 
of  Pennsylvania  a  family  by  the  name  of  Conner, 
which  at  that  time  were  taken  captives  by  the  Indians 
(theShawnees,we  believe,)  and  carried  away  to  Detroit, 
remaining  in  state  of  captivity  sufficiently  long  to 
become  thoroughly  acquainted  with  the  Indian  lan- 
guage, customs,  etc.,  etc.  They  were  finally,  through 
the  interposition  of  some  French  residents  at  that 
place,  liberated,  the  father  remaining  a  permanent 
resident  of  that  city.  In  1798,  at  the  age  of  eighteen 
years,  William  Connor  left  his  paternal  hearth-stone 
and  sought  to  carve  out  for  himself  his  own  fortune, 
and  with  this  view  he  settled  at  Saginaw  Bay  and 
there  commenced  trading  with  the  Indians.  At  this 
early  period  of  Western  history  the  trader  was  both  a 
traveler  and  a  hunter.      To  lay  in  his  stock  of    goods 


it  was  necessary  to  make  long  and  wearisome  jour- 
neys through  the  forest  upon  horseback,  and  the  trans- 
portation of  his  goods  was  eflfected  upon  pack-horses. 
In  his  journeyings  his  eye  was  attracted  by  the  nat- 
ural beauty  of  scenery,  the  richness  of  the  soil,  the 
abundance  of  game  of  the  fur-bearing  species,  and  the 
commanding  locality  of  Hamilton  County  (Indiana), 
and  in  1802  he  settled  in  a  beautiful  prairie,  which 
has  ever  since  borne  his  name  (located  a  little  below 
Noblesville).  Here  he  established  a  trading  post, 
which  for  many  years  was  the  great  central  mart  at 
which  the  various  tribes  inhabiting  central  Indiana 
did  their  trading. 

o 

At  what  time  John  Conner  left  Detroit  and  where 
he  first  began  his  trading  with  the  Indians  is  not 
known  to  the  writer.  It  may  be  that  he  accompanied 
his  brother  William,  for  the  Hon.  Elijah  Hackleman, 
of  Wabash,  in  a  contribution  of  "  Reminiscences  "  to 
the  Rushville  Republican  in  1884,  speaks  of  the  two 
as  building. a  trading  house  in  what  is  now  Franklin 
County,  in  the  early  history  of  the  Whitewater  Val- 
ley. Whether  the  two  were  together  or  not,  it  is  rea- 
sonable to  presume  that  as  each  followed  the  same 
business  in  those  early  times,  they  were  at  least  in 
intercourse  with  each  other. 

The  first  definite  knowledge  we  have  of  John  Con- 
ner's presence  in  the  Whitewater  country  is  given  in 
the  writings  of  Rev.  Allen  Wiley,  heretofore  spoken 
of.  In  speaking  of  the  year  180-1  Mr.  Wiley  says: 
"Three-quarters  of  a  mile  above  Big  Cedar  Grove 
Creek,  Mr.  John  Conner,  an  Indian  trader,  had  a 
store  kept  by  a  Frenchman,  hence  the  store  was  called 
the  French  store." 

William  McClure,  from  whom  we  have  elsewhere 
quoted,  as  nearly  as  we  can  judge  of  the  year  1807, 
writes:  "  John  Conner  and  Pilkey,  Indian  traders, 
had  a  store  in  the  bottom,  where  John  T.  Cooley  for- 
merly lived."  And  the  author  of  the  "History  of 
Franklin  County  "  says  of  this  store:  "There  is  little 
doubt  b^^t  this  trading  post  was  the  first  white  man's 
establishment  within  the  limits  of  the  county.  No 
traditions  of  an  earlier  one  are  found  among  the  peo- 
ple of  to-day." 

The  next  point  for  consideration  is  the  establish- 
ment of  the  trading-post  of  Conner,  or  Conner  &amp; 
Pilkey,  further  north  in  Fayette  County,  on  the  site  of 
the  city  of  Connersville.  From  what  has  been  said 
above  Conner  is  known  to  have  been  above  Big  Cedar 
Grove  Creek  in  1804,  and  probably  in  1807,  but  the 
time  of  his  removal  or  abandonment  of  that  post  for 
the  one  further  up  on  the  frontier  can  only  be  arrived 
at  by  tradition.  Thomas  Simpson,  now  a  resident  of 
the  county,  aged  eighty-four  years,  with  a  clear  mem- 
ory and  vivid  recollection  of  the  past,  is  authority  for 
the  saying  that   John  Conner  had  his  trading-post 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY.

here  at  Connersville  in  the  year  1808.  Mr.  Simpson's 
father  was  through  the  county  at  that  time,  and  found 
Conner  here;  so  it  is  fair  to  conclude  that  the  post 
was  established  here  some  time  between  1804  and  1808. 

About  the  first  of  the  present  century  the  Conners 
were  found  among  the  most  expert  Indian  traders  of 
Indiana  Territory,  and  soon  attracted  the  attention  of 
Gov.  Harrison,  who  in  his  intercourse  with  the  Indians 
employed  them  as  interpreters.  As  early  as  1805,  at 
the  treaty  of  Grouseland,  August  1,  we  find  that  John 
Conner  acted  in  that  capacity.  From  that  time  on  to 
the  treaty  of  Wabash,  October  23,  1826,  and  during 
the  interval,  in  which  ten  treaties  had  been  held  with 
the  Indians,  one  and  sometimes  both  of  these  gentle- 
men were  employed  as  interpreters,  and  during  the 
war  William  Conner  was  the  principal  military  inter- 
preter of  Gov.  Harrison. 

After  the  battle  of  the  Thames,  in  which  he  was 
engaged,  he  was  specially  deputied  by  Gen.  Harrison 
to  recognize  the  body  of  Tecumseh,  with  whom  he 
had  long  been  acquainted. 

John  Conner  is  said  to  have  had  for  a  wife  an 
Indian  woman  and  a  son  by  the  name  of  James,  a 
half-blood.  The  Indian  wife  died  about  the  close  of 
the  last  war  with  England,  and  he  then  married 
Lavina,  daughter  of  Jabez  Winship,  who  lived  on 
Little  Cedar  Grove.  In  1813  he  laid  out  the  town  of 
Connersville,  and  had,  as  early  as  1810,  a  grist  and 
sawmill  in  operation  near  the  trading-post,  which 
was  probably  two  hundred  yards  up  the  branch  from 
the  A.  B.  Conwell  mill  building,  on  Eastern  Avenue. 
In  1816  he  served  in  the  State  Senate,  and  was  the 
first  Senator  for  this  county  and  the  first  Sheriflf. 
He  was  an  active  business  man  in  early  Connersville 
carrying  on  milling,  farming  and  merchandising. 
He  removed  from  the  village  he  had  founded  to  the 
vicinity  of  Noblesville,  this  State,  in  1823,  and,  it  is 
said,  some  years  later  died  while  on  a  trip  or  visit  to 
the  city  of  Indianapolis,  which  city  he  had,  in  com- 
pany with  nine  others,  selected  and  located  the  per- 
manent seat  of    justice  of  the  State. 

Concerning  the  Conners,  we  give  the  following  from 
the  pen  of  Hon.  Samuel  W.  Parker,  written  in  1855: 

"Some  twenty-five  years  ago,  a  stranger  of  venera- 
ble and  martial  appearance  by  the  name  of  Rankin, 
from  Kentucky,  passing  through  the  country 
stopped  and  dined  at  Sample's  Hotel,  now  the  Bate's 
House  in  this  town,  where  I  was  then  boarding. 
The  name  of  our  town  reminding  the  stranger  of  his 
old  friends,  the  Conners,  he  inquired  after  John  and 
William,  evidently  with  much  interest;  he  then 
observed  that  ho  had  made  their  acquaintance  during 
the  late  war  with  Great  Britain,  and  knew  them  well; 
remarked  that  in  a  perilous  march  he  made  under 
Gen.  Harrison  up  toward  the  lakes,  the  Conners  were 


selected  for  the  guides  of  the  army;  that  they  had  a 
deep  stream  to  cross  over  a  difficult  and  dangerous 
ford,  where  the  Indian  ambuscade  was  apprehended; 
that  Gen.  Harrison  came  to  him  before  they  entered 
the  stream,  and  observed:  'I  think  those  Conners 
are  true,  but  some  -stories  to  their  prejudice  have 
come  to  my  ears,  and  from  the  fact  that  they  have 
been  among  the  British  and  Indians  the  most  of  their 
days,  I  must  confess  to  enough  of  suspicion  to  be  on 
the  lookout.  They  say  they  understand  this  ford, 
and  can  and  will  conduct  us  safely  over.  If  they 
could  be  in  league  with  the  enemy  and  betray  us, 
here  is  the  place  for  it  to  be  done.  Do  you  fol- 
low close  after  them  with  your  hand  upon  your  hol- 
sters, and  should  they  for  a  moment  lead  us  into 
water  too  deep  for  fording,  shoot  them  down.'  They 
entered  the  stream,  Rankin  close  after,  and  the  whole 
army  following.  Near  the  middle  the  horses  of  the 
guides  stepped  into  a  deep  place.  In  an  instant, 
both  exclaimed,  as  Rankin's  cocked  pistol  was  pre- 
sented: ^Hold!  the  ford  is  changed.  We' II  be  right 
in  a  moment!'  In  a  moment  they  were  right  again, 
and  all  got  safely  over.  'And  that  moment,'  said 
the  narrator,  'saved  the  life  of  the  proprietor  of  your 
town,  and  his  brother,  William;  whom,'  said  he,  'I 
afterward  found  to  be  as  true  and  noble  Americans 
as  ever  I  knew.'  " 

Mr.  Parker  remarked  that  the  incident  was  given 
as  substantially  received,  saying:  "I  can't  vouch  for 
its  authenticity,  having  never  seen  or  heard  of  it  else- 
where; nor  seen  nor  heard  of  the  strange  Kentuckian 
before  or  since,  but  I  know  of  no  reason  to  question 
its  accuracy." 

In  1808-09,  Thomas  Simpson,  Sr.,  a  native  of 
Maryland,  was  employed  as  hunter  to,  and  accom- 
panied the  surveying  party,  while  they  were  engaged 
in  surveying  the  lands  of  the  "Twelve-Mile  Pur- 
chase," at  which  time  he  traversed  the  territory  of 
the  county  throughoiit,  and  in  the  month  of  Decem- 
ber, 1809,  removed  his  family  to  a  cabin  house, 
which  had  previously  been  erected  for  the  surveying 
party,  and  stood  on  what  is  now  the  northeastern 
part  of  Jennings  Township. 

Daniel  Green,  it  is  said,  while  prospecting  for 
land  further  south,  in  what  is  now  Franklin  County, 
in  the  year  1809,  was  attracted  by  the  sound  of  a 
cowbell,  and  on  following  its  sound  he  came  to  a 
cabin,  occupied  by  John  Eagan  and  family,  situated 
along  the  river  in  what  is  now  Jackson  Township, 
some  little  distance  south  of  the  bridge  over  the  river 
at  Nulltown.  Mr.  Eagan  was  an  Irishman,  but  came 
from  Maryland  here,  and  both  he  and  Simpson 
remained  permanent  settlers. 

At  what  time  the  Eagan  settlement  was  made  is  not 
now  known,  yet  it  is  quite  probable  that  it  did  not

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


precede  the  trading-post  of  Conner.  The  account  of 
this  settlement  is  purely  traditional  and  the  date  un- 
supported by  family  record  or  other  history,  so  far  as 
we  can  learn;  yet  it  is  not  at  all  improbable,  as  John 
Eagan  and  his  brother  William  were  very  early  set- 
tlers along  the  river,  the  former  entering  land  in 
Jackson  Township  in  1811. 

The  settlements  of  Conner  and  Simpson  are  the 
earliest  made  in  the  county  of  which  anything  defi- 
nite or  satisfactory  can  be  ascertained. 

Family  traditions  concerning  the  early  settlements 
often  confound  the  date  of  the  tirst  visit  of  a  pioneer 
to  his  lands,  or  the  date  of  his  purchase,  with  that  of 
his  settlement.  Many  of  the  pioneer  settlers  of  the 
county  tirst  stopped  in  the  county  south  (Franklin), 
and  subsequently  moved  further  north  and  made  set- 
tlements within  the  present  limits  of  Fayette  County. 
Family  traditions  of  such  frequently  confound  these 
dates. 

From  known  facts  we  can  safely  assume  that  there 
were  few  settlers  within  the  present  limits  of  the 
county  prior  to  1811,  at  which  time  the  tide  of  immi- 
gration set  in. 

The  details  of  the  early  settlements  belong  to  the 
several  townships,  where  they  will  be  found. 

PIONEER    LIFE. 

The  first  dwellings  of  the  pioneers  were  the  round- 
log-cabins,  constructed  as  follows:  Round  logs  of 
proper  size  were  selected,  notched  at  the  ends,  the 
spaces  between  the  logs  being  filled  in  with  pieces  of 
wood  and  daubed  with  clay.  The  roof  was  made  by 
laying  small  logs  or  stout  poles,  reaching  from  gable 
to  gable,  suitable  distances  apart,  on  which  were  laid 
the  split  clap-boards  after  the  manner  of  shingling, 
showing  two  feet  or  more  to  the  weather.  These 
clap-boards  were  fastened  by  laying  across  them 
heavy  poles,  called  weight  poles,  reaching  from  one 
gable  to  the  other.  The  floor  was  of  puncheons  split 
from  logs  several  inches  in  thickness,  hewed  on  the 
upper  side.  The  chimney  was  made  of  sticks  laid 
up  cob-houso  fashion,  gradually  narrowed  in  at  the 
top  and  plastered  with  clay.  For  a  window,  a  small 
opening  was  made  and  greased  paper,  for  admitting 
light,  was  pasted  over  it.  The  door  was  of  clap- 
boards hung  on  wooden  hinges.  Such  a  house  was 
built  by  a  neighborhood  gathering,  with  no  tools  but 
the  axe  and  the  frow,  and  often  was  completed  in  a 
single  day. 

The  internal  arrangements  of  one  of  these  rude 
dwellings  has  thus  been  described:  "The  door  is 
opened  by  pulling  a  leather  string  that  lifts  a  wooden 
latch  on  the  inside.  (The  inmates  made  themselves 
secure  in  the  night  season  by  pulling  the  string  in.) 
On  entering  it  (it  being  meal-time)  we  find  a  portion 


of  the  family  sitting  around  a  large  chest  in  which 
their  valuables  had  beeu  brought,  but  which  now 
serves  as  a  table  from  which  they  are  partaking  their 
plain  meal,  cooked  by  a  log-heap  tire.  In  one  corner 
of  the  room  are  two  or  more  clap- boards  on  wooden 
pins,  displaying  the  table-ware,  consisting  of  a  few 
cups  and  saucers,  and  a  few  blue-edged  plates,  with 
a  goodly  number  of  pewter  plates,  perhaps  standing 
singly  on  their  edges,  leaning  against  the  wall,  to 
render  the  display  of  table  furniture  more  conspicu- 
ous. Underneath  this  cupboard  are  seen  a  few  pots 
and  perhaps  a  Dutch  oven.  Not  many  chairs  having 
been  brought  in,  the  deficiency  has  been  supplied 
with  stools  made  of  puncheon  boards,  with  three  legs. 
Over  the  doorway  lies  the  indispensable  rifle  on  two 
wooden  hooks,  probably  taken  from  a  dog- wood  bush 
and  nailed  to  a  log  of  the  cabin.  Upon  the  inner 
walls  hang  divers  garments  of  female  attire,  made  of 
cotton  and  woolen  fabrics,  and,  perhaps,  one  or  two 
blue  and  white  calico  dresses  which  had  done  long 
service  in  the  Carolinas  before  their  transportation 
hither." 

Rev.  William  C.  Smith,  in  his  "  Indiana  Miscella- 
nies," thus  speaks  of  one  way  of  lighting  these  primi- 
tive homes:  "During  the  day  the  door  of  the  cabin 
was  kept  open  to  alford  light,  and  at  night,  through 
the  winter  season,  light  was  emitted  from  the  fire- 
place, where  huge  logs  were  kept  burning.  Candles 
and  lamps  were  out  of  the  question  for  a  few  years. 
When  these  came  into  use  they  were  purely  domestic 
in  their  manufacture.  Candles  were  prepared  by 
taking  a  wooden  rod  some  ten  or  twelve  inches  in 
length,  wrapping  a  strip  of  cotton  or  linen  around  it, 
then  covering  it  with  tallow  pressed  on  with  the  hand. 
These  "sluts,"  as  they  were  sometimes  called, 
answered  the  purpose  of  a  very  large  candle,  and 
afforded  light  for  several  nights.  Lamps  were  pre- 
pared by  dividing  a  large  turnip  in  the  middle, 
scraping  out  the  inside  quite  down  to  the  rind,  then 
inserting  a  stick,  say  three  inches  in  length,  in  the 
center,  so  that  it  would  stand  upright.  A  strip  of 
cotton  or  linen  cloth  was  then  wrapped  around  it,  and 
melted  lard  or  deer's  tallow  was  poured  in  till  the 
turnip  rind  was  full,  when  the  lamp  was  ready  for 
use.  By  the  light  of  these  during  the  long  winter 
evenings  the  women  spun  and  sewed,  and  the  men 
read  when  books  could  be  obtained.  When  neither 
lard  nor  tallow  could  be  had,  the  large  blazing  fire 
supplied  the  needed  light.  By  these  great  fire-places 
many  cuts  of  thread  have  been  spun,  many  a  yard  of 
linsey  woven,  and  many  a  frock  and  buckskin  panta- 
loons made."  The  second-class  dwelling  was  the 
hewed-log-house,  more  pretentious  in  looks  and  more 
comfortable.  These  could  be  made  as  comfortable  as 
any  kind  of  building.     Log-cabin  raisings  and  log-

rollings  were  occasions  of  great  social  intercourse. 
Preparations  for  such  occasions  were  made  in  advance 
of  the  appointed  day;  trees  were  selected  and  felled, 
the  logs  dragged  in,  the  skids  and  forks  made  ready 
and  the  foundations  laid.  At  the  time  fixed  upon  for 
the  raising  the  neighbors  assembled  for  miles  around, 
captains  were  chosen  and  the  work  progressed  with 
great  dispatch,  and  amid  much  glee  and  merriment, 
iintil  the  walls  were  up  and  the  roof  weighted  down. 

The  land  of  this  region  in  its  primitive  state  was 
covered  with  heavy  timber,  beneath  which  was  an 
undergrowth  of  various  kinds,  such  as  spicewood, 
leatherwood,  elderberry  and  some  bearing  fruits,  as 
grapes,  pluma,  gooseberries,  pawpaws,  crab  apples, 
etc.,  with  plenty  of  nettles,  grass,  peavine  and  weeds 
in  the  summer. 

The  labor  of  opening  up  a  farm  was  no  little 
task;  the  trees  were  to  be  felled,  the  branches  severed 
from  their  trunks,  and  the  underbrush  gathered 
together  for  burning.  The  trunks  of  the  large  trees 
were  to  be  divided  and  rolled  together  and  reduced  to 
ashes.  It  is  said  with  hard  labor  the  unaided  settler 
could  clear  and  burn  an  acre  of  ground  in  three  weeks. 

Different  methods  and  practices  of  clearing  land 
have  been  resorted  to»  by  the  pioneer  of  different 
localities.  In  some  States  it  was  the  custom  to  cut 
down  all  the  timber  at  lirst,  but  this  did  not  prevail 
here.  The  bushes  were  either  cut  down  or  grubbed 
out,  and  the  smaller  trees  were  chopped  down.  The 
large  trees  were  left  standing,  and  "deadened"  by 
girdling.  On  this  subject  Dr.  Mason,  who  settled  in 
the  county  in  1816,  says:  "I  had  a  fine  creek  bottom 
of  some  ten  acres,  a  portion  of  which  had  been 
grubbed  of  the  underbrush,  and  I  determined  upon 
clearing  and  fencing  five  acres  of  it  to  put  into  corn. 
The  timber  had  been  deadened  and  was  light,  except 
some  large  sycamore  trees.  Around  those  I  piled 
brush'and  built  tires,  and  in  this  way  killed  most  of 
them." 

Flax  was  cultivated  and  sheep  raised,  and  there- 
from by  the  spinning-wheel  and  hand-loom  wearing 
apparel  manufactured.  Carding  wool  by  hand  was 
not  uncommon.  "Both  men  and  women  were  clad  in 
linen  and  linsey,  all  of  their  own  manufacture.  Some 
wore  buck-skin  breeches  and  moccasins,  but  they  gen- 
erally had  linen  for  every -day  wear,  and  a  man  was 
fortunate  who  could  get  'six  hundred  linen'  for  shirts 
and  pantaloons  for  Sunday.  The  women  would  color 
the  linen  thread  with  copperas,  or  some  cheap  dye,  and 
stripe  or  cross  their  dresses,  and  when  they  got  them 
on  they  were  about  as  proud  and  put  on  as  many  airs 
as  they  do  at  the  present  day.  Once  in  awhile  one 
of  the  more  fortunate  ones  would  get  hold  of  six 
yards  of  calico,  which  was  a  full  pattern  in  those 
days,  and  when  they  got  it  made  up  with  two  strings 


sewed  on  to  the  waist  behind,  and  brought  before  and 
tied,  it  would  do  you  good  to  see  them  spread  them- 
selves, and  unless  a  man  had  jilenty  of  dollars  he 
could  not  shine  with  them." 

The  breaking  up  of  ground  and  cultivation  of  crops 
was  attended  with  difficulty.  The  bar-share  and 
shovel  plows,  and  later  the  bull  plow  with  wooden 
mouldboard,  husk  collars  and  tug,  and  rope  traces  and 
withs;  the  sickle  lirst,  then  the  cradle  and  scythe,  and 
threshing  with  a  flail  or  treading  out  with  horses,  and 
cleaned  by  means  of  a  sheet  by  the  aid  of  several  per- 
sons, characterized  the  implements  of  farming. 

Almost  the  only  modes  of  travel  in  those  times 
were  on  foot  or  on  horseback.  Corn  and  wheat  were 
taken  to  the  mill  on  horseback;  friends  and  relatives 
in  the  distant  East  were  visited  on  horseback.  Salt 
iron  and  such  other  commodities  as  were  indispensable 
were  frequently  carried  by  means  of  pack-horses:  and 
often  settlers  came  to  their  forest  homes  by  this 
moans.  Lawyers  and  preachers  made  the  circuit  in 
this  way,  and  the  roads  were  mere  paths  with  notched 
or  blazed  trees  as  a  guide. 

The  procuring  of  bread  was  often  a  hardship  to  the 
pioneer;  mills  in  early  times  were  few  and  far  between 
and  of  rude  construction,  making  it  often  a  journey 
of  miles  through  an  almost  trackless  forest  and  over 
bridgeless  streams,  the  trip  fraught  with  danger  on 
every  hand. 

At  the  time  of  its  settlement  this  region  was  in- 
habited by  deer,  wolf,  bear,  wild  cat,  fox,  otter,  por- 
cupine; occasionally  a  panther,  turkey,  raccoon, 
skunk,  mink,  rattlesnake  and  blacksnake. 

Almost  countless  numbers  of  squirrels  were  to  be 
found  in  the  woods  and  great  watchfulness  was  re- 
quired on  the  part  of  the  settler  to  protect  his  corn- 
fields from  destruction  both  from  these  and  other  ani- 
mals, and  from  birds.  Blackbirds  in  large  flocks  were 
destructive  to  the  corn  while  yet  soft,  and  later  on  the 
raccoon  and  squirrel.  Squirrel  hunts  were  frequent 
and  prizes  paid  in  corn  to  those  killing  the  greatest 
number.  We  have  before  us  a  paper  showing  the 
names  of  persons  engaged  in  a  squirrel  hunt  on  the 
11th  and  12th  of  August,  1820,  with  the  number  of 
squirrels  killed  by  each  and  the  number  of  bushels 
of  corn  each  received.      The  number  killed  was  502. 

The  social  gatherings  were  attended  by  all,  the 
settlers  were  mutually  dependent  upon  each  other, 
and  more  hospitality  was  the  result.  As  we  have 
heretofore  remarked,  at  the  log-rollings  and  house- 
raisings  the  whole  neighborhood  was  present,  and  at 
the  quiltings  and  huskings  the  same  spirit  was  char- 
acteristic. The  long  winter  evenings  were  spent  in 
contentment,  but  not  in  idleness. 

In  speaking  of  pioneer  days  in  this  county  Hon. 
Samuel  Little,  of  Nebraska,  thus  wrote  in  1879:

HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


"To  recount  the  toils  of  the  past,  enumerate  the 
privations  and  note  the  pleasures  of  pioneer  life  in 
Fayette  County,  and  contrast  the  '  then  '  of  the  past 
with  the  '  now  '  of  the  present,  must  produce  a  glow 
of  honest  pride  in  the  breasts  of  the  aged  few  who 
yet  remain  to  recount  the  past  and  survey  the  present. 

' '  Each  of  you  for  self  can  look  at  the  present  as 
it  lies  before  you,  and  I  will  not  attempt  to  picture 
it,  but  hope  to  recall  somewhat  of  the  condition  of 
the  county  in  1833,  when  I  located  among  you. 

"That  portion  of  the  county  lying  east  of  the 
'  old  boundary  line' being  settled  ten  years  earlier 
than  the  west  side,  had  nearly  passed  the  stage  of 
log-cabins.  Every  farm  had  its  occupant,  many  had 
comfortable  frame  or  brick  dwellings,  and  some  had 
barns  and  fruit-bearing  orchards;  but  nearly  all  the 
improvements  on  our  western  border  were  of  a  primi- 
tive character,  and  it  is  mainly  of  this  part  of  the 
county,  in  which  I  lived  for  forty-throe  years,.  I 
would  speak. 

"Farms  ranged  in  size  from  a  forty-acre  tract  to 
a  quarter  section,  and  nearly  all  of  them  had  some 
improvement.  The  log-cabin  was  the  prevailing 
dwelling,  and  it  was  almost  alivays  surrounded  by  a 
cleared  patch,  or  deadening,  ripening  for  the  lire, 
by  whose  agency  it  was  cleared  up  for  the  plow.  So 
dense  was  the  forest  that  the  only  evidences  of  other 
occupied  farms  near  by  was  the  sound  of  the  ax,  the 
crowing  fowls  or  barking  watch-dog. 

"  Paths  leading  from  cabin  to  cabin  passed  around 
large  trees  or  logs  and  over  streamlets,  led  us  through 
the  tangle  of  spice-wood  or  pawpaw  in  our  neighbor- 
ly visits,  and  highways  were  marked  out  and  cordu- 
roy bridges  bore  us  over  marshes  on  our  way  to  mar- 
ket, public  worship,  or  to  mill  in  our  wagons,  up  hill 
and  down  the  same,  and  through  streams,  which  were 
all  without  bridges.  The  stumps,  roots  and  logs  gave 
the  beaten  track  a  serpentine  direction,  which  re- 
quired great  skill  in  the  teamster.  If  Levi  Conwell 
were  here  he  could  tell  you  all  about  it,  or  if  you  ask 
Uncle  Billy  Simpson  how  he  used  to  freight  A.  B. 
Conwell's  whisky  and  flour  to  Cincinnati  and  return 
with  a  load  of  store  goods,  he  can  describe  it  better 
than  I  can.  Pork  and  the  articles  named  were  our 
staple  productions.  Cincinnati  was  our  only  market. 
Our  pork  was  driven  on  foot,  requiring  an  average  of 
eight  days  to  roach  our  destination,  three  to  close  out 
the  sale,  and  two  more  to  return.  The  entire  trip 
consumed  about  two  weeks'  time.  Wheat  sold  in  Cin- 
cinnati in  1834  at  50  cents  per  bushel,  flour  for 
$2.75  per  barrel,  and  Uncle  Abe  can  give  you  the 
price  of  whisky;  as  I  did  not  handle  it  my  memory  is 
at  fault.  We  got  but  little  money,  and  we  spent  lit- 
tle. Our  food  grew  on  our  farms,  and  our  clothing 
was  mostly  home  made,  growing  in  the  flax  patch  or 


on  the  sheep's  back,  and  its  manufacture  was  mostly 
domestic.  The  flax-pulling  and  wool-picking  were 
frequently  done  by  combination  or  neighborhood 
frolics,  and  were  occasions  of  great  social  pleasure. 
There  are  mothers  present  who  could  tell  how  they 
used  to  race  with  their  sweet-hearts  at  the  flax-pull- 
ings,  and  some  of  them  recollect  how  the  points  of 
their  fingers  ached  after  pulling  the  burs  and  stick- 
tights  out  of  the  wool.  Yes,  and  how  they  enjoyed 
their  trip  on  foot  to  the  spelling-match  or  singing- 
school  with  their  boaux  by  their  side,  just  to  help 
them  over  the  fences  and  mud  holes.  Or,  perchance, 
they  rode  behind  on  the  same  horse,  so  that  if  the 
horse  stumbled  they  could  hold  on!  I  can  answer 
for  the  other  sex  that  a  girl  behind  me  on  a  stumbling 
horse  was  rather  awkward,  but  not  at  all  unpleasant. 
"Don't  you  grand-dames  recollect  how  the  flyers  of 
the  flax  wheel  hummed  whilst  your  gent  sat  by  you, 
or  how  your  bare  feet  tripped  over  the  puncheon  floor 
to  the  sound  of  the  big  wheel  as  you  drew  out  those 
long  threads  of  yarn  which  were  to  be  converted  into 
the  winter's  wear.  I  assure  you  it  was  a  pleasure  to 
sit  by  whilst  the  shuttle  flew  from  hand  to  hand  as 
that  yarn  grew  into  cloth.  The  wheel  and  loom  did 
not  sound  so  refined  as  the  organ  and  the  piano,  but 
their  product  was  far  more  useful.  Most  families 
were  thus  clothed.  We  used  but  little  tea  or  coffee, 
and  the  sugar  camp  furnished  our  sweets.  Our  log- 
rollings, house-raisings  and  harvesting  cultivated  a 
social  spirit  and  placed  us  all  on  an  equality,  as  we 
were  mutually  dependent.  Men  and  women  did  their 
own  work  with  but  little  hired  help.  Wages  were 
low  (from  110  to  $12  per  month),  but  money  was 
scarce.  I  reaped  with  a  reaping-hook,  in  the  harvest 
of  1834  for  62J  cents  per  day,  and  cradled  the  fol- 
lowing harvest  for  $1  per  day.  Our  farm  tools  were 
quite  simple,  but  cost  but  little  money.  We  used  the 
'bull'  plow  with  wooden  mould-board  and  iron 
share  for  turning  the  soil,  and  the  single  shovel- 
plow  for  cultivating  the  crop.  This,  with  a  swingle- 
tree  and  harness,  trace-chains  and  back- band,  fur- 
nished out  our  rig.  We  had  no  cultivators,  single  or 
double,  nor  riding  plows.  We  had  never  seen  a 
reaper,  or  mower,  nor  could  we  have  used  them  among 
the  stamps.  Nor  had  we  any  threshing  machines. 
Our  small  grain  was  threshed  out  by  flail  or  tramped 
out  by  horses  on  an  earthen  floor  prepared  for  the 
purpose,  and  cleaned  by  a  fanning  mill  with  wooden 
cogs.  The  fall  season  was  mostly  occupied  in  burn- 
ing off  the  rubbish  of  our  deadenings,  and  keeping 
our  '  niggers  '  busy  in  preparing  the  logs  for  rolling 
in  the  spring.  Our  logs  were  rolled  into  heaps  and 
burned  in  the  spring,  the  rails  or  fencing  having  been 
made  during  the  intervening  winter.  Stormy  days 
and  winter  nights  were  used  to  make  and  repair  the

family  shoes  from  leather  tanned  in  our  county,  and 
largely  made  by  the  farmers  at  their  own  firesides, 
which  were  wide  and  warmed  by  a  bountiful  supply 
of  fuel.  If  some  of  you  old  folks  will  mentally  take 
an  inventory  of  an  average  dwelling  of  those  days, 
you  would  lind  as  a  part  of  its  appendages  a  shoe- 
bench,  with  needed  tools,  spinning-wheels,  for  flax 
and  wool.  The  hand  loom  and  warping-bars,  the 
wash-tub,  in  which  the  clothes  were  cleansed  without 
even  a  washboard,  the  Dutch  oven,  in  which  the  corn- 
pone  and  chicken-pie  were  baked,  and  by  its  side  a 
dinner-pot,  skillet  and  tea-kettle,  but  no  cook  stove. 
A  Bible  and  some  school-books,  added  to  some  furni- 
ture of  home-make,  almost  complete  the  picture.  The 
active  men  and  women  here  today  were  born  and 
reared  in  just  this  kind  of  place.  Our  streams  were 
bridgeless;  our  commerce  had  neither  turnpikes  nor 
railroads;  our  business  was  done  without  telegraph, 
and  we  talked  without  telephones,  and  when  you  take 
a  survey  of  your  surroundings,  the  present  generation, 
your  offspring,  your  rich  and  beautiful  farms,  villages, 
cities,  and  their  manufactories,  together  with  all 
your  moral,  social  and  religious  advantages,  don't 
you  think  that  we  did  well,  and  don't  you  join  me  in 
the  wish  that  our  children  may  do  better?  " 

FRIENDLY    AND    HOSTILE    INDIANS. 

At  the  dawning  of  civilization  upon  the  White- 
water country,  the  series  of  conflicts  with  the  Indi- 
ans that  had  been  carried  on  to  the  east  throughout 
the  Northwest  Territory  for  a  long  period  of  years  had 
hardly  been  allayed;  and  the  early  settlers  were  for  a 
time  considerably  annoyed  by  the  Indians.  The  pio- 
neer was  frightened  by  open  menaces  and  actual  mur- 
ders. The  Rev.  W.  C.  Smith,  author  of  "Indiana 
Miscellanies,"  recollects  of  having  heard  an  Indian 
relate  the  first  one  of  several  instances  of  his  taking 
the  lives  of  white  persons.  At  the  age  of  about  four-  ■ 
teen,  he  was  permitted  to  accompany  a  party  of 
"braves"  going  to  a  white  settlement  to  scalp  and 
plunder,  on  a  promise  that  he  would  be  brave.  The 
first  night  he  and  another  young  Indian  were  sent  to 
reconnoitre  a  cabin.  They  returned  and  reported 
that  there  were  in  it  but  a  man  and  woman.  They 
were  ordered  to  go  back  and  kill  them.  They  returned 
to  the  cabin,  and  shot  through  an  opening  of  the 
jambs,  entered  the  cabin  and  scalped  them,  and 
returned  to  their  comrades  with  the  bloody  trophies. 
We  quote  again  from  Mr.  Wiley,  whom  it  will  be 
remembered  settled  in  the  Whitewater  country  in 
180-1:  "  In  all  the  upper  Whitewater  country,  the  Abo- 
rigines were  numerous  and  used  to  come  among  us  for 
trafiic,  but  their  great  headquarters  for  that  purpose 
was  the  before- mentioned  store  owned  by  Mr.  Conner. 
When  they  visited  us  they  behaved  civilly,  and  we 


had  no  difficulty  with  them  at  that  time."  Through- 
out the  valley  horse-stealing  and  other  depredations 
were  occasionally  committed  by  them. 

A  campaign  against  the  Indians  was  inaugurated 
by  the  United  States  Government  in  1811,  and  on  the 
7th  of  November  of  that  year  the  battle  of  Tip- 
pecanoe was  fought  under  Gen.  Harrison.  The 
settlements  along  Whitewater  were  frontier  posts, 
and  ere  the  declaration  of  war  against  Great  Britain 
was  proclaimed,  blockhouses  were  built  extending 
along  the  main  stream  and  each  branch  and  point  of 
settlement  further  west,  through  what  are  now  Frank- 
lin, Fayette,  Union  and  Wayne,  and  perhaps  other 
counties.  Beginning  at  the  south  there  was  a  block- 
house about  half  a  mile  above  Johnson's  Fork  on  the 
bank  of  the  river;  one  three  and  a  half  miles  below 
Brookville  on  the  farm  of  Conrad  Sailors;  one  each 
on  Pipe  and  Salt  Creeks,  and  perhaps  several  on 
West  Fork'  Ijefore  entering'  what  is  now  Fayette 
County;  several  on  East  Fork  extending  through 
Franklin  and  Union  Counties,  one  of  which,  an 
important  one  too,  was  located  where  the  village  of 
Brownsville  now  is,  in  the  vicinity  of  which  a  com- 
pany of  volunteers  had  been  raised  under  Capt.  Myers 
and  performed  service  on  the  frontier.  There  stood 
a  block-house  just  below  Nulltown,  one  in  the  north- 
ern part  of  Harrison  Township,  and  several  through 
Wayne  County.  Maj.  Helm,  who  resided  near  the 
block-house  at  Nulltown,  was  in  command  along  the 
frontier.  It  is  not  presumed  that  at  each  of  these 
several  block-houses  were  garrisoned  United  States 
soldiers;  the  fi-ontier  was  somewhat  guarded,  and 
perhaps  for  a  time  might  have  been  stationed  at  the 
larger  and  more  outward  posts,  troops.  While  the 
settlers  resorted  to  this  means  of  defense  or  protec- 
tion, we  believe  no  engagements  or  encounters  at 
them  ever  occurred  with  the  Indians,  especially  within 
the  limits  of  Fayette  County.  During  the  war  Indian 
alarms  were  frequent  and  the  settlers  were  kept  con- 
stantly in  a  state  of  disquiet.  Rev.  Mr.  Smith,  in 
giving  a  description  of  one  of  these  block-houses 
says,  "  They  were  made  of  two  rows  (sometimes  but 
one  row)  of  split  timbers,  twelve  to  fourteen  feet  long, 
planted  in  the  ground  two  and  a  half  or  three  feet  deep. 
The  timbers  of  the  second  row  were  so  placed  as  to 
cover  the  tracks  of  the  first.  Small  cabins  were 
erected  inside  of  the  stojkades  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  the  families;  usually  one  block-house  was 
built  in  each  fort.  These  block-houses  were  two-sto- 
ries high,  the  upper  story  projecting  over  the  lower, 
say  two  feet,  with  port  holes  in  the  floor  of  the  pro- 
jection, so  that  the  men  could  see  to  shoot  the  Indi- 
ans if  they  succeeded  in  getting  to  the  walls  of  the 
block-house.  There  were  also  port  holes  in  the  walls 
of  the  upper  and  lower  stories,  through  which  shoot-

ing  of  much  execution  could  be  performed  as  the  foe 
was  advaneinfj." 

Several  murders  committed  by  the  Indians  oc- 
curred throughout  the  Whitewater  Valley,  but  none, 
we  believe,  happened  within  the  limits  of  Fayette 
County.  Says  the  author  of  the  "Wayne  County 
History"  published  in  1872,  "In  1811  John  Short- 
ridge  was  shot  by  an  Indian  south  of  the  present  town 
of  Germantown  and  about  a  mile  east  of  Milton, 
while  riding  on  horseback,  in  company  with  George 
Ish.  This,  however,  is  said  to  have  been  done  by  mis- 
take. The  Indian  had  had  some  difficulty  with  a  man 
by  the  name  of  Isaac  Drury.  Shortridge,  having  on 
Drury's  overcoat,  was  mistaken  for  the  owner,  and 
shot  on  his  white  horse.  He  was  carried  about  a  mile 
to  a  fort  which  had  been  built  half  a  mile  south  of 
whore  Germantown  now  is.  Word  having  been  sent 
to  the  fort  north  (Boyd  Fort),  Samuel  K.  Boyd  and 
Larkin  Harding  went  down  and  attended  Shortridge 
until  his  death  the  next  day.  For  the  want  of  boards 
to  make  a  coffin,  puncheon  floor  planks  were  used  for 
the  purpose. " 

Two  men,  Tune  and  Stafford,  were  killed  by  the 
Indians  in  what  is  now  Franklin  County  in  the 
spring  of  1813.  Mr.  McClure  in  his  notes  speaks  of 
the  killing  as  having  occurred  at  the  same  time  while 
they  were  engaged  in  burning  brush  on  Salt  Creek. 
The  date  of  the  murder  as  fixed  by  Hon.  Elijah 
Hackleman  was  MarehU3,  1813. 

Charles  Morgan,  residing  near  the  stream  now 
called  Morgan's  Creek,  and  two  boys  or  youths,  his 
half-brothers,  named  Beesly,  were  killed  near  a 
sugar-camp  by  Indians  in  the  evening.  The  leader  or 
principal  in  this  murder  is  supposed — perhaps  gen- 
erally— to  have  been  the  notorious  Indian,  John 
Green.  This  supposition  is  probably  based  upon  the 
fact  that  a  mutual  hatred  existed  between  him  and 
Morgan.  The  writer  has  been'informed  upon  author- 
ity which  he  cannot  doubt,  that  Morgan,  under  the 
apprehension  that  Green  was  meditating  his  murder, 
intended  to  take  the  life  of  Green  in  order  to  save 
his  own,  and  that  he  once  started  from  home  with  the 
avowed  intent  of  waylaying  his  adversary  for  this 
purpose.  Although  Green  had  probable  designs 
against  Morgan,  and  perhaps  was  accessory  to  the 
murder,  there  is  strong  presumptive  evidence  that  he 
was  not  present  when  it  was  committed^.  The  sus- 
pected murderers,  four  in  number,  were  traced  toward 
Muncietown  and  overtaken,  and  one  of  them  shot;  the 
others  escaped.  Morgan  and  ,his  brothers  were  all 
scalped.  The  murder  was  committed  in  the  spring 
of  1813.  This  occurrence  induced  many  families  to 
take  shelter  in  the  forts  erected  for  their  protection.

Mr.  Hackleman  fixes  the  date  of  this  murder  on 


the  same  night,  March  13,  1813,  with  that  of  Staf- 
ford and  Tune,  and  remarks:  "Early  next  morning 
the  militia  of  the  vicinity,  under  Maj.  William  Holm, 
were  on  the  trail  of  the  Indians,  but  were  unsuccess- 
ful, as  they  were  never  able  to  overtake  them.  A 
few  weeks  afterward  a  part  of  Capt.  Brysoa's  com- 
pany had  a  brush  with  some  Delaware  Indians  near 
Strawtown,  where  Morgan's  tent  and  clothes  were 
found  in  the  deserted  camp. " 

Below  is  given  an  account  of  the  captivity  and 
subsequent  life  of  Miss  Tharp,  which  occurred  in 
Fayette  County,  as  narrated  by  Hon.  Elijah  Hackle- 
man, of  Wabash,  Ind.,  in  1884: 

"  With  the  history  of  this  captivity  I  am  but  lit- 
tle acquainted,  as  I  do  not  recollect  ever  seeing  the 
same  in  print.  And  yet,  from  my  earliest  recollec- 
tions, the  story  was  as  familiar  in  every  family  in 
southeastern  Indiana  as  household  words.  Moses 
Tharp  lived  somewhere  in  the  upper  valley  of  the 
Whitewater.  On  the  fatal  evening,  his  children  were 
playing  near  his  cabin,  when  suddenly  his  little  girl 
mysteriously  disappeared,  and  was  nowhere  to  be 
found,  although  diligent  search  was  made.  On  close 
examination  by  expert  pioneer  hunters,  fresh  '  signs  ' 
of  Indians  wore  discovered,  and  the  trail  was  fol- 
lowed to  the  White  River  country,  to  the  vicinity  of 
Muncietown.  There  appeared  to  be  no  doubt  that 
the  girl  had  been  stolen  by  the  Indians.  She  was 
never  recaptured.  After  the  close  of  the  war,  when 
peace  was  restored,  Mr.  Tharp  spent  several  years  of 
hia  life  in  hunting  for  his  lost  child.  He  visited 
most  of  the  Indian  tribes  in  the  north  part  of  the 
Territory,  under  the  guise  of  an  Indian  trader,  but 
specially  for  the  purpose  of  discovering  the  location 
of  the  object  of  his  affections.  His  efforts  were  not 
crowned  with  success,  until  the  girl  had  grown  up  to 
womanhood  and  had  married  Capt.  Dixon,  a  Miami 
Indian,  who  was  living  at  the  mouth  of  Grant 
Creek,  on  the  Mississinawa  River,  near  the  old  Josi- 
nia  Village,  in  Wabash  County,  two  miles  west  of 
Ashland.  Here  Mr.  Tharp  and  his  wife  finally  dis- 
covered and  recognized  their  long-lost  daughter  some 
time  after  her  marriage  with  Capt.  Dixon. 

"I  have  been  informed  by  Hon.  Jacob  L.  Sailors, 
of  Wabash  County,  who  was  a  neighbor  of  Capt. 
Dixon,  on  Grant  Creek,  that  about  forty  years  ago, 
he  (Sailors)  recollects  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Tharp  visiting 
their  daughter  at  Capt.  Dixon's  for  a  few  days. 
What  finally  became  of  Mr.  Tharp  I  am  not  informed; 
but  I  have  heard  it  stated  that  ho  spent  the  decline 
of  life  somewhere  in  the  Wabash  valley. 

"  This  Capt.  Dixon  was  a  thriftless,  quarrelsome 
Indian,  when  drunk,  and  spent  most  of  his  time  in 
drinking  and  fighting,  at  such  places  as  he  could 
procure  whisky.      But  Miss  Tharp  (or,  rather,  Mrs. 


HISTORY  OF  PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


45 


Dixon),  although  uneducated,  was  kind  and  affection- 
ate with  her  family,  and  polite  and  lady-like  with 
her  white  neighbors.  Mrs.  Dixon  manifested  a 
desire  to  have  her  children  educated,  and  did  for  a 
time  send  her  son,  Charlie  Dixon,  to  a  school,  taught 
by  Mr.  Sailors,  in  the  vicinity,  where  he  made  some 
progress  in  reading  and  writing.  I  have  often  seen 
the  Captain  and  Mrs.  Dixon  at  their  Indian  home. 

"Finally,  about  the  year  1851  or  1852,  in  one  of 
his  drunken  fights  with  a  Pottawattomie  Indian, in  the 
town  of  Ashland,  Capt.  Dixon  received  a  blow  with  a 
hoe,  that  happened  to  be  near  by,  cutting  his  head 
open.  The  wound  was  dressed  by  my  friend,  Dr.  E. 
D.  Mauzy — then  of  Ashland,  but  now  of  Oakland, 
Cal., — and  although  it  was  a  terrible  wound,  the 
Doctor  expressed  his  opinion  that  if  the  patient  could 
be  kept  perfectly  still,  there  would  be  a  chance  for 
his  recovery. 

"The  Indians  then  in  town  wanted  to  take  Capt. 
Dixon  home  the  same  evening,  but  Dr.  Mauzy  told 
them  that  he  would  die  before  reaching  his  home, 
although  it  was  only  about  two  miles  distant.  The 
next  morning,  however,  the  Indians  came  in  great 
numbers,  and  demanded  that  he  should  be  taken 
home  immediately.  Of  course  no  resistance  was 
made.  The  Captain  was  put  on  a  sled,  and  when 
last  seen,  was  going  pretty  lively  over  the  rough 
roals.  The  journey  was  accomplished  in  good  time, 
but  on  reaching'the  wigwam,  it  was  found  that  Capt. 
Dixon  was  cold  and  stiff  in  death. 

"About  this  time — I  am  not  sure  whether  it  was 
before  the  death  of  Capt.  Dixon  or  afterward — Miss 
Tharp,  the  wife  of  Capt.  Dixon,  in  a  lit  of  despon- 
dency, left  her  Indian  home,  and  walked  down  to  the 
Mississinawa  River,  a  half  mile  distant,  to  a  place 
called  'Hog  Back.'  This  romantic  spot  is  caused 
by  a  long  detour  of  the  river,  then  coming  around 
with  a  long  sweejj  into  conjunction  with  Grant 
Creek,  which  runs  within  eighty  feet  of  the  waters  of 
the  Mississinawa  above  the  detour,  and  then  flowing 
off  and  joining  the  waters  below,  enclosing  several 
hundred  acres  of  land.  Between  these  two  waters  is 
a  rugged  hill  or  ridge,  eighty  feet  high  and  one 
hundred  yards  long,  bearing  the  euphonious  name 
above  noted.  Here  Miss  Tharp,  the  captive  white 
woman,  paused  a  few  moments,  and  then  deliberately 
plunged  into  the  blue  waters  of  the  Mississinawa 
River,  and  was  seen  no  more  alive.  And  here  let  the 
grief,  anguish  and  melancholy  aching  of  a  heart  as 
pure  as  yours  or  mine  remain  forever." 

On  the  above  subject  many  years  ago  in  the  vil- 
lage of  Lebanon,  Ohio,  Rev.  David  Sharpe,  who  as  a 
Methodist  preacher  traveled  the  old  Whitewater  Cir- 
cuit in  1813,  remarked  to  a  resident  of  Connorsville 
"  that   he  preached  occasionally  at  Tharp's,  near  the 


river,  about  one  and  one-half  miles  above  Conners- 
ville.  At  one  of  his  visits,  in  the  fall  or  winter  of 
1813-14,  while  sitting  in  the  cabin  with  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Tharp,  they  were  startled  by  the  screaming  of 
the  children,  who  were  out  playing  between  the 
house  and  the  river.  As  they  all  ran  toward  the 
river,  they  met  the  youngest  two  children  crying  and 
running  to  the  house;  they  heard  the  screams  of  the 
oldest,  a  little  girl  some  eight  years  old,  as  if  she 
was  being  carried  off.  They  followed,  but  the  voice 
became  more  and  more  faint,  and  soon  they  lost  the 
trail.  The  Indians  had  made  their  escape  with  the 
child." 

The  territory  in  the  western  portion  of  the  coun- 
ty belonging  to  the  Indians  until  in  1818,  Con- 
nersville  and  the  settlements  to  the  west  were  strictly 
speaking  on  the  frontier,  and  from  the  fact  of  the 
long  established  post  by  Conner,  both  below  and  on 
the  present  site  of  the  city,  the  county  and  neighbor- 
ing territory  were  often  the  scene  of  many  bands  of 
wandering  tribes  of  Indians,  whither  they  had  come 
principally  to  barter  their  furs  and  exchange  traffic  at 
the  "  post,"  and,  perhaps,  in  the  earlier  period,  to 
hunt  and  fish.  Conner  was  a  great  man  among  them, 
and  exerted  considerable  influence  over  them,  and  the 
post  was  an  attractive  place.  Mr.  Conner  when 
dressed  in  their  costume,  and  painted,  it  was  diffi- 
cult to  distinguish  him  from  a  real  savage.  On  one 
occasion,  says  Oliver  H.  Smith,  he  came  to  Anderson- 
town  (Franklin  County),  then  the  lodge  of  a  large 
band  of  Indians,  under  Chief  Anderson.  He  was 
dressed  and  painted  as  a  Shawnee,  and  pretended  to 
be  a  representative  of  Tecumseh.  As  is  usual  with 
the  Indians,  he  took  his  seat  on  a  log  barely  in  sight 
of  the  Indian  encampment,  quietly  smoked  his  pipe, 
waiting  the  action  of  Anderson  and  his  under  chiefs. 
After  an  hour  he  saw  approaching  the  old  chief  him- 
self, in  full  dress,  smoking  his  pipe.  I  give  his 
language.  "  As  the  old  chief  walked  up  to  me  I  rose 
from  my  seat,  looked  him  in  the  eyes,  we  exchanged 
pipes,  and  walked  down  to  the  lodge  smoking,  with- 
out saying  a  word.  I  was  pointed  to  a  boar  skin, 
took  my  seat,  with  my  back  to  the  chiefs.  A  few 
minutes  after,  I  noticed  an  Indian  by  the  name  of 
Gillaway,  who  knew  me  well,  eying  me  closely.  I 
tried  to  evade  his  glance,  when  he  bawled  out  in  the 
Indian  language,  at  the  top  of  his  voice,  interpreted: 
'You  great  Shawnee  Indian,  you  John  Conner.'  The 
next  moment  the  camp  was  in  a  perfect  roar  of  laugh- 
ter. Chief  Anderson  ran  up  to  me,  throwing  off  his 
dignity:  '  You  great  representative  of  Tecumseh,'  and 
burst  out  in  a  loud  laugh." 

Indian  trails  or  paths  crossed  the  county  leading 
from  the  trading  post  to  their  villages  to  the  north 
and  northwest,  among  which  was  the  one  located  in 


46 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTP]    COUNTY. 


the  center  of  the  "  Thorntown  lloservation,"  in  Boone 
County,  and  another  at  Oldtown,  near  the  jjresent  city 
of  Muncie.  In  the  early  history  of  the  territory  the 
site  of  Waterloo  is  supposed  to  have  been  an  Indian 
camp.  In  1808-09  a  band  of  Indians  were  encamped 
along  Simpson's  Creek  in  northern  Jennings  Town- 
ship, in  the  vicinity  of  the  spring  still  there;  and  in 
the  neighborhood  was  located  an  Indian  place  of 
burial. 

The  pioneers  of  Fayette  County  were  not  molested 
or  troubled  to  any  considerable  extent  by  the  presence 
of  these  wandering  red  men,  saving  a  little  occa- 
sional thieving,  although  subjected  now  and  then  to 
a  fright.  As  late  as  1820  Oliver  H.  Smith  remarks 
that  "  Connersville  was  filled  with  them  every  day." 
At  a  period  not  much  later  than  this,  they  were  un- 
frequent  visitors.  We  judge  that  the  Indians  of 
this  locality  during  the  early  settlement  of  the 
valley  belonged  to  the  Delaware  and  Pottawat- 
tomie  families.  Numerous  traditionary  accounts  of 
thieving  Indians  in  this  section  have  come  to  our 
ear  during  the  investigation  of  this  subject,  and  the 
accounts  of  the  killing  of  several  of  them,  but  as 
nothing  definite  or  satisfactory  could  be  obtained 
relative  thereto,  a  narration  is  withheld.  Concernino' 
the  disappearance  or  killing  of  Chief  Ben  Davis,  who 
was  one  of  the  Delaware  tribes  of  Indians,  and  had 
located  in  the  Whitewater  country,  and  was  there 
residing  during  the  early  settlement  of  the  country, 
and  after  whom  was  called  the  stream  still  bearing 
that  name,  in  Kush  County,  the  name  of  which  chief 
was  for  years  a  household  word  throughout  the  val- 
ley, is  given  below  the  account  as  published  in  the 
Rushville  Republican  some  years  ago,  written  by  Dr. 
John  Arnold,  of  that  city,  an  old  and  highly  esteemed 
pioneer  of  that  vicinity: 

"  Personally  Ben  Davis  was  a  large  and  powerful 
Indian  warrior,  a  deadly  foe  to  the  whites;  and  he 
had  frequently  led  his  braves  on  raids  into  the  dark 
and  bloody  ground — the  debatable  land  of  Kentucky. 
In  most  of  the  battles  for  the  possession  of  the  pres- 
ent States  of  Ohio  and  Indiana,  he  had  taken  an 
active  part.  He  was  true  to  his  friends,  implacable 
to  his  foes,  fond  of  firewater,  and  when  under  its 
influence,  regardless  of  his  surroundings,  would  boast 
of  his  prowess,  and  the  number  of  scalps  he  had  taken. 
In  shprt,  he  was  a  representative  man  of  his  race,  a  fair 
type  of  the  brave,  crafty  and  boastful  Indian  warrior. 

''After  the  defeat  of   the  Indians  at  Tippecanoe, 


they  were  compelled  to  sell  their  lands,  and  again 
move  westward.  But  Old  Ben  Davis,  although  well 
aware  that  he  was  looked  upon  with  dislike  and  sus- 
picion, by  the  white  settlers,  still,  occasionally  revis- 
ited his  former  hunting-grounds.  In  the  year  1820 
he  had  encamped  on  Blue  Creek,  some  three  miles 
from  Brook vi lie.  He  had  been  there,  perhaps  a 
week,  daily  visiting  the  town  and  drinking  too  much 
whisky.  One  day  in  the  Widow  Adair's  tavern,  he 
was  boasting  of  his  bloody  deeds,  unmindful  of  the 
angry  glances  of  the  crowd  around  him,  and  among 
other  things  how  he  with  his  band  surprised  a  lonely 
settler  in  Kentucky,  killing  him  with  all  his  family 
except  one  boy,  who  happened  to  be  a  short  distance 
from  the  cabin,  when  attacked,  and  who,  although 
hotly  pursued,  eluded  his  enemies  and  escaped.  Now 
in  that  crowded  bar-room  there  was  one  intensely 
interested  listener,  a  stern  man,  who  heard  from  the 
lips  of  the  old  chieftain  the  particulars  of  the  story  of 
his  family's  massacre;  for  he  was  that  flying  boy  who 
had  saved  his  life  by  fleetness  of  foot  when  all  his 
kindred  fell.  Without  a  word  he  left  the  room.  The 
next  day  Ben  Davis  did  not  make  his  appearance  in 
Brookville;  but  it  excited  but  little  remark,  for  he 
was  erratic  in  his  movements.  The  second  day  some 
one  passing  his  camp  found  the  old  chief  cold  in 
death,  with  a  bullet  hole  in  his  forehead,  and  his 
pipe  fallen  by  his  side,  for  he  had  been  sitting  by 
his  fire,  smoking,  when  he  received  his  sudden  mes- 
sage to  visit  the  happy  hunting-grounds  of  the  Indi- 
an's paradise.  It  was  a  fitting  death  for  so  fierce  a 
spirit,  for  though  he  had  escaped  the  whistling  shot 
and  trenchant  steel  in  many  a  battle,  he  finally  fell 
a  victim  to  private  vengeance.  Public  opinion,  while 
unanimous  as  to  the  author  of  the  deed,  recognized 
the  terrible  provocation,  and  justified  the  act  more 
readily,  as  many  had  lost  friends  by  the  hands  of  the 
red  man.  No  judicial  investigation  was  ever  had, 
and  the  young  man  still  held  a  respectable  standing 
in  society." 

Ben  Davis  never  forgave  or  forgot  an  injury. 
When  his  tribe,  broken  and  defeated,  was  compelled 
to  cede  his  lands,  he  held  himself  aloof,  refusing  to 
join  in  any  treaty,  though  sullenly  submitting  to  its 
requirements,  and,  while  bowing  to  the  decrees  of  an 
inexorable  and  restless  destiny,  declined  by  word  or 
deed  to  approve  or  sanction  them.  His  name  will  be 
perpetuated  by  that  lovely  stream,  which  waters 
some  of  the  best  lands  of  Eush  County.

CHAPTER  IV. 


^   EARLY  EELIGIOUS  AND   EDUCATIONAL  MOVEMENTS. 
OLD  SCHOOL    BAPTISTS— METHODISM— PRESBYTERIANISU— THE  CHRISTIAN  CHURCH— SCHOOLS. 


IT  is  the  purpose  of  this  chapter  to  present  briefly 
and  in  a  general  way  some  little  knowledge  of 
the  introduction  of  religious  societies  into  the  county, 
and  give  an  idea  of  the  early  educational  system  of 
the  State,  leaving  a  more  detailed  sketch  of  the  vari- 
ous churches  and  schools  to  the  chapters  on  the  city 
and  townships  in  which  they  are  located. 

OLD    SCHOOL    BAPTISTS. 

In  a  previous  chapter  it  has  been  shown  that  the 
tide  of  early  immigration  to  the  Whitewater  Valley 
generally  proceeded  from  the  South  and  East.  The 
larger  portion  of  the  people  settling  early  in  Ohio 
west  of  the  Great  Miami  River,  and  in  the  southern 
Whitewater  country  hailed  from  the  South,  and 
among  them  were  many  Kentuckians,  among  whom 
prevailed  the  Baptist  denomination;  and  from  the 
State  of  Kentucky  were  sent  to  the  region  of  country 
in  question  many  popular  ministers.  Much  of  the 
pioneer  preaching  was  by  these  Kentucky  ministers. 
Says  Rev.  Allen  Wiley,  "It  is  presumed  that  the  first 
meeting  house  ever  built  in  Whitewater  Valley  was 
on  Lee's  Creek,  a  small  branch  of  the  Dry  Fork  of 
Whitewater,  a  log-house  located  about  three  miles 
east  of  Harrison." 

Another  of  the  early  places  for  holding  meetings 
was  at  the  house  of  Joseph  Hackleman,  above  John- 
son's Fork.  A  church  society  was  constituted  here 
in  the  spring  or  summer  of  1805,  and  William  Tyner, 
who  resided  south  of  Brookville,  became  the  pastor. 
Probably  within  a  year  a  log  meeting-house  with 
gallery  was  erected  on  Mr.  Hackleman's  land,  "the 
first  meeting-house  ever  built  in  the  Whitewater 
Valley  on  the  Indiana  side  of  the  line." 

The  next  place  of  worship  was  a  small  log-house 
situated  some  three  miles  below  Brookville,  a  little 
below  Little  Cedar  Grove  Creek.  This  building  in 
a  few  years  was  destroyed  by  tire,  and  in  1812  was 
replaced  by  a  medium  sized  brick  which  still  stands. 

Among  the  early  Baptist  preachers  of  the  southern 
Whitewater  country  were  Ezra  Ferris  at  Lawrence- 
biirg,  Jeremiah  Johnson  at  Hackleman's,  James 
Remy  at  Johnson's  Fork,  Moses  Hornady  at  Indian 
Creek,  Lewis  Deweese,  William  Tyner  and  John 
Blades  at  Little  Cedar  Grove,  and  William  Wilson 
on  West  Fork.     Between  1806  and  1810  several  arms 


grew  out  of  this  church  and  became  separate  organ- 
izations. These  were  located  principally  in  what  is 
now  Franklin  County,  with  perhaps  one  or  two  in 
Union  County.  As  the  territory  became  more  thickly 
populated  other  arms  and  new  societies  grew  with 
the  march  of  settlement  uutil  the  country  was  pretty 
well  dotted  over  with  the  cabin  meeting  houses  of 
the  Old  School  Baptist  denomination. 

The  first  churches  of  this  denomination  constituted 
in  Fayette  County  were  in  ISl-l,  Franklin  below 
Nulltown,  New  Bethel  in  northern  Jennings  Town- 
ship and  the  Lick  Creek  Church  south  of  Harrisburg. 

METHODISM. 

Says  Rev.  Allen  Wiley,  "When  I  came  to  the 
Whitewater  in  the  fall  of  1804,  there  were  only  two 
men  oh  it  so  far  as  I  know,  who  had  ever  been  Meth  - 
odists.  These  were  James  Cole  and  Benjamin  Mc- 
Carty.  The  latter  had  been  an  exhorter  or  local 
preacher  in  Tennessee.  He  settled  on  Whitewater 
in  the  summer  of  1803,  at  which  time  he  had  rather 
fallen  from  his  religious  engagements.  He  after- 
ward became  a  local  preacher  of  medium  talents. 
Subsequently  he  connected  himself  with  the  United 
Brethren. 

"Enoch  Smith  came  in  the  fall  of  1805  or  winter 
of  1806  and  lived  on  my  father's  farm.  His  wife 
was  a  most  devoted  and  pious  woman,  who  was  one 
of  the  main  pillars  in  the  church  after  its  formation. 
These  persons,  with  a  few  others,  sent  a  petition  to 
John  Sale,  who  was  their  Presiding  Elder  in  the 
Ohio  district.  In  their  petition  they  asked  that  a 
regular  traveling  preacher  be  sent  to  them  to  preach 
and  form  societies.  After  the  petition  had  been 
sent  in,  McCarty  began  preaching  in  the  neighbor- 
hood, and  the  people  were  taught  something  of 
Methodist  doctrines." 

In  the  spring  of  1806  Rev.  Joseph  Oglesby  was 
sent  by  the  Conference  to  form  a  new  circuit  west  of 
the  Great  Miami  River,  to  be  known  as  the  White- 
water Circuit.  On  the  east  side  of  East  Fork  some 
four  miles  south  of  Richmond,  in  what  is  now  Wayne 
County,  had  settled  in  1805  a  man  by  the  name  of 
Hugh  Cull,  who  built  a  shanty  of  logs  with  bark 
covering.  His  wife  bad  been  a  Methodist  in  Ken- 
tucky.    Soon  after  this  his  dwelling  was  visited  by  a

preacher  from  Hamilton,  Ohio,  the  neighbors  called 
in  and  services  were  held,  which  resulted  in  the 
formation  of  a  class,  of  which  Mr.  Cull  became 
leader.  He  subsequently  became  a  local  preacher 
and  that  locality  became  a  regular  preaching  place. 

Mr.  Oglesby  preached  in  several  places  in  Ohio 
and  in  the  Kentucky  settlement  in  Wayne  County, 
and  from  thence  he  went  down  Whitewater  to  Mc- 
Carty's,  more  than  forty  miles  distant.  At  this  place 
Mr.  Oglesby  formed  a  flourishing  society,  which 
remained  many  years.  In  1807  Revs.  Thomas  Hel- 
ium and  Sela  Payne  were  appointed  to  the  circuit- 
In  the  spring  of  1807  Charles  Waddle  and  two  or 
three  other  families  settled  in  what  is  now  the  eastern 
part  of  Uuion  County,  and  formed  themselves  into  a 
class.  In  the  autumn  of  1809  Revs.  Thomas  Nelson 
and  Samuel  H.  Thc)mpson  were  appointed  to  the 
Whitewater  Circuit,  John  Sale  being  Presiding 
Elder. 

At  the  Conference  of  1812  the  Whitewater  Circuit 
was  divided,  and  that  part  of  it  east  of  Brookville 
was  called  Oxford  Circuit.  John  Strange  was  sent 
this  year  to  the  Brookville  Circuit,  which  then 
embraced  much  of  the  present  Franklin  County,  the 
settled  pait  of  Wayne  and,  perhaps,  a  part  of  Fayette 
County.  The  preacher  then  traveled  from  block-house 
to  block-house,  with  his  gun  on  his  shoulder  for  pro- 
tection against  the  Indians.  The  first  Methodist 
meeting-house  built  in  the  Whitewater  country  is 
said  to  have  been  a  small  log-hause  that  stood  on 
Clear  Creek  east  of  Salisbury,  in  Wayne  County. 
This  was  erected  in  1811. 

The  earliest  evidence  we  have  of  Methodist  preach- 
ing within  the  present  limits  of  Fayette  County,  is 
contained  in  the  following  scrap  of  history  related 
many  years  ago,  in  the  village  of  Lebanon,  Ohio,  by 
Rev.  David  Sharpe,  who  traveled  the  Whitewater 
Circuit  in  1813  (it  was  a  six  weeks'  circuit): 

"  Mr.  Sharpe  began  his  work  at  Brookville,  and 
preached  there  his  tirst  Sunday;  from  there  on  Mon- 
day to  Williams'  on  Deer  Creek;  Tuesday,  to 
Bryson's  Block-house,  about  four  miles  below  Laurel; 
Wednesday,  to  Roberts'  Blockhouse;  Thursday,  to 
Montgomery's,  in  Wayne  County;  Friday,  atMoffitt's, 
on  the  East  Fork  of  Whitewater;  Saturday,  in  Hugh 
Cull's  neighborhood;  Sunday,  at  John  ISIeek's,  on  the 
east  side  of  the  East  Fork  of  Whitewater;  Monday, 
in  the  court  house  in  New  Salisbury;  Tuesday,  at 
Hardy  Cain's;  Wednesday,  at  Abijah  Cain's;  Thurs- 
day, name  of  the  place  forgotten;  Friday,  at  Eaton, 
Preble  Co.,  Ohio;  Saturday,  six  miles  north  of  Eaton; 
Sunday,  at  Widow  Sharpe's,  on  Twin  Creek;  Monday, 
at  Stephens',  four  miles  south  of  Eaton;  Tuesday,  at 
Hanna's,  on  Hanna's  Creek,  Indiana;  Wednesday,  at 
Nott's,  west  of  the  East  Fork  of  Whitewater;  Thurs- 


day, at  Jones'  Schoolhouse;  Friday,  at  Bright's,  eight 
miles  above  Brookville;  Saturday,  at  Johnson's,  on 
the  West  Fork,  four  miles  above  Brookville;  Sunday, 
in  the  schoolhouse  in  Brookville. 

"At  each  of  the  above  named  appointments,  he 
preached  once  in  six  weeks,  except  Brookville,  where 
he  preached  every  three  weeks. 

"  There  was  no  preaching  at  that  time  at  '  Con- 
ner's Station,'  but  he  preached  occasionally  at  Mr. 
Tharpe's,  near  the  river,  about  one  and  one-half 
miles  above  Connersville." 

The  progress  of  Methodism  in  the  country  prior 
to  1823  was  not  raj)id.  There  were  two  societies 
only  east  of  the  West  Fork  that  were  in  progress  at 
that  time. 

In  1821  a  circuit  was  formed  by  Rev.  John 
Havens,  a  local  preacher,  which  included  the  village 
of  Connersville  and  was  styled  Connersville  Circuit, 
and  came  into  the  Conference  the  following  year. 
This  was  under  the  Presiding  Eldership  of  Rev. 
Alexander  Cummins.  Rev.  James  Murray  was 
appointed  to  the  circuit  in  1822,  and  in  1823  Rev. 
Aaron  Wood.  The  following  is  a  copy  of  the  plan  of 
the  circuit  in  1823: 

Fayette  County — Connersville,  Hankin's  Hink- 
ston's,  Hardey's. 

Franklin  County — Con  well's.  Grist's,  Alley's, 
Lewis'. 

Decatur  County — Miller's,  Emley's,  Sholt's. 

Rush  County — Grigg's,  Young's,  Taylor's,  Groves'. 

Fayette  County — Patterson's,  Jacob  Lower's. 

Henry  County — Killes,  Morris',  New  Castle,  Stan- 
ford's, Leonard's. 

Fayette  County — Joe  Lower's,  Briggs'. 

One  of  the  early  ministers  in  a  communication  to 
the  writer  remarked  that  "the  proprietors  and  first 
settlers  of  Connersville  were  skeptics  on  religion, 
and  it  was  a  hard  place  for  any  Evangelical  religious 
influence.  The  towns  of  Centerville  and  Brookville 
were  much  in  advance  of  Connersville  in  Methodist 
societies." 

Without  undertaking  to  give  the  various  changes 
of  the  circuits,  districts  and  conferences,  which  have 
since  comprised  the  numerous  churches  of  the  county, 
we  will  state  that  in  general  the  churches  east  of  the 
West  Fork  of  Whitewater  River  have  been  connected 
with  circuits  to  the  east,  while  those  west  of  that 
stream  have  been  attached  to  the  Connersville  Circuit, 
and  circuits  growing  out  of  it. 

The  following  list  contains  the  names  of  the 
preachers  who  traveled  the  circuits  of  which  the 
churches  of  the  county  formed  a  part,  for  a  quarter 
of  a  century,  beginning  with  1823,  both  east  and 
west  of  West  Fork: 

1823 — Revs.  Bigelow  and  Gatch,  east;  Rev.  Aaron 
Wood,  west.

Connersville  and  Whitewater  Circuits  were  favored 
with  the  labors  of  a  large  number  of  talented  and 
industrious  local  preachers,  prominent  among  whom 
was  James  Conwell,  the  proprietor  of  Laurel.  He 
conducted   a  dry  goods   store,  and   annually  di-ove  a 


great  many  hogs  to  Cincinnati,  and  is  said  to  have 
been  the  first  man  ever  known  to  keep  the  Sabbath 
while  driving  hogs  to  market.  He  was  one  of  the 
early  and  zealous  advocates  of  a  system  of  internal 
improvements  in  Indiana.  The  Whitewater  Canal 
owed  its  construction  and  was  in  a  measure  due  to 
his  influence.  He  served  as  a  member  of  the  State 
Legislature.  Says  Rev.  Aaron  Wood  of  him,  "He 
was  a  very  sympathetic  man,  cried  a  great  deal  while 
he  was  preaching,  and  usually  made  his  hearers  cry 
before  he  was  done."  From  1824  to  several  years 
afterward,  James  Conwell,  John  Havens,  Joel 
Havens,  Thomas  Silvey,  John  Morrow,  James  Gregg, 
John  Linville,  James  Linville,  Robert  Groves  and 
Thomas  Leonard  were  all  within  the  bounds  of  Con- 
nersville Circuit. 

Dr.  Wood  remarks,  "Every  variety  of  gifts  were 
exemplified  in  these  men.  They  were  strong  in  doc- 
trine, wise  in  discipline,  critical  in  letters,  bold  in 
reproof,  and  pathetic  in  exhortation;  and  at  a  camp- 
meeting  their  labors  were  very  efficient  for  lasting 
good  on  the  entire  community.  John  Morrow  was  a 
scholarly  man,  and  spent  most  of  his  life  as  a  school 
teacher.  Joel  Havens  was  chiefly  noted  for  his  won- 
derful gift  of  exhortation.  Few  men  knew  how  to 
play  on  the  emotions  and  passions  of  an  audience  as 
did  ho.  Charles  Hardy,  William  Patterson  and 
William  Hunt  were  also  talented  local  preachers 
within  the  bounds  of  Connersville  Circuit." 

PRESBYTEHIANISM. 

The  following  in  substance,  concerning  early 
Presbyterianism,i8  extracted  from  the  writings  of  Rev. 
Liadlow  D.  Potter: 

'  'The  first  Presbyterian  minister  of  whose 
labors  in  this  region  we  have  any  record  was  Rev. 
Samuel  Baldridge,  who  organized  a  society  of  seven- 
teen members  at  the  house  of  John  Allen,  near  Har- 
rison, where  he  preached  steadily  until  1814.  From 
1810  to  1814  he  worked  as  an  itinerant  missionary 
in  the  Whitewater  Valley,  having  various  preaching 
places  from  Lawrenceburg  to  Dunlapsville.  He 
preached  at  Brookville  and  at  Robert  Templeton's, 
and  at  Mr.  Hanna's,  near  Banna's  Creek.  At  that 
time  there  were  several  families  here  who  were 
adherents  to  the  Presbyterian  faith.  Among  these 
were  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Barbour  from  Ireland,  Judge 
Arthur  Dixon  and  wife  and  brother  from  Harper's 
Church  in  Washington  County,  Va.,  Mr.  Young  (who 
kept  what  has  since  been  called  the  "Yellow  Tav- 
ern" and  who  was  from  Pennsylvania),  John  Vincent 
and  wife,  Robert  Templeton  and  wife,  the  Knights, 
and  Mr.  and  Mrs.  William  McCleary,  who  were 
from  Frederick  County,  Md.  All  of  these  resid- 
ed   in     town  except    Mr.    Templeton,    the    parents

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


of  Mrs.  Ryburn  and  one  of  the  Dixons;  the  latter 
lived  on  the  Rushville  road  at  the  foot  of  Boundary 
Hill.  He  afterwards  moved  to  a  farm  near  Conners- 
ville  and  a  few  years  afterward  united  with  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  Arthur  Dixon  was  a 
blacksmith.  He  removed  to  Connersville  in  1823 
and  his  wife  was  one  of  the  early  members  of  the 
church  organized  there.  After  the  removal  of  Mr. 
Baldridge  from  Harrison,  there  was  occasional  preach- 
ing in  HarrisoD,    Brookville,  Somerset   and   adjacent 

settlements  by  Rev.  Robertson,  of  Kentucky, 

Rev.  James  Dickey,  of  Ohio,  and  others,  for  four  or 
live  years,  during  which  period  other  families  had 
settled  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  From  1816 
to  1825  efforts  were  made  to  gather  these  people  in 
churches.  This  resulted  ia  the  organization  of 
churches  at  Brookville  in  1818,  Mount  Carmel  in 
18—  Somerset  about  1823,  and  Bath  in  1825." 

During  this  period,  besides  occasional  supplies 
from  Presbytery  and  various  itinerant  clergymen,  the 
friends  of  Presbyterianism  were  much  encouraged  by 
the  faithful  and  zealous  labors  of  two  young  minis- 
ters, who  were  fi'om  the  East  as  domestic  missionaries. 
These  wece  A.  W.  Piatt,  of  New  York,  and' W.  W. 
Barton,  of  New  Jersey.  After  spending  three  or  four 
years  traversing  the  country  from  Lawrenceburg  to 
Richmond,  these  brethren,  to  the  great  grief  of  the 
people,  saw  fit  to  return  to  their  native  States. 

In  1824  the  Cincinnati  Presbytery  (Old  School) 
sent  Rev.  Daniel  Hayden  to  Connersville  to  preach 
and  if  practicable  to  organize  a  church.  Mr.  Hayden 
arrived  in  the  village  October  2d,  preached  in  the 
Court  House  on  the  3rd  and  on  the  4th  an  organiza- 
tion was  effected. 

THE    CHRISTIAN    CHURCH. 

About  the  year  1828  the  teachings  of  the  Church 
of  the  Reformation,  commonly  known  as  Campbellism, 
were  being  preached  in  Kentucky  with  almost  un- 
bounded success  by  the  Rev.  John  Smith,  whose  elo- 
quence was  making  converts  by  the  hundreds,  if  not 
by  thousands.  We  refer  particularly  to  Bracken 
County,  which  had  been  the  former  home  of  an  able 
and  eloquent  young  Baptist  preacher,  by  the  name  of 
John  P.  Thompson,  who  had  settled  in  Rush  County 
in  the  spring  of  1822.  Mr.  Thompson  immediately 
became  the  pastor  of  the  Baptist  Church  at  Little 
Flat  Rock.  It  was  not  long  until  his  reputation  as  a 
speaker  had  spread  over  the  country,  and  through  his 
influence  Baptist  Churches  were  organized  in  differ- 
ent parts  of  the  surrounding  country. 

The  excitement  in  Kentucky  over  the  doctrines  of 
the  Reformation  disturbed  the  young  Baptist  preacher 
of  the  Little  Flat  Rock  Church,  and  he  concluded  to 
visit  his  old  home  and  investigate  things  for  himself, 
so  he  went,  carrying  with  him  the  full  confidence  of 


his  own  church  in  his  power  and  ability  to  meet  and 
annihilate  the  new  doctrine.  Suffice  it  to  say,  that 
Mr.  Thompson  returned  a  convert  to  the  doctrines  of 
the  Church  of  the  Reformation,  and  it  was  not  long 
until  notice  was  given  that  there  would  be  a  meeting 
at  the  house  of  Elias  Stone,  near  Danville  (now  Fay- 
etteville)  Fayette  County,  on  Sunday,  October  5, 
1828,  and  at  that  meeting  it  is  said  the  first  sermon 
of  the  Reformation  was  preached  in  eastern  Indiana 
by  John  P.  Thompson,  who  immediately  began  a  pro- 
tracted meeting  at  Little  Flat  Rock  Church.  In  a 
few  weeks  he  had  baptized  upward  of  100  persons. 
For  a  time  all  of  the  Baptist  Churches  acquiesced 
in  the  new  order  of  things;  but  finally  a  reaction 
came,  and  throughout  eastern  Indiana,  and,  in  fact, 
the  whole  country,  religious  controversies  were  the 
order  of  the  day,  which  resulted  in  a  division  of  the 
churches. 

For  a  number  of  years  Mr.  Thompson  devoted  all 
of  his  time  and  talents  for  the  cause  of  the  Reforma- 
tion, and  organized  a  number  of  chiu'ches,  the  first 
being  the  Christian  Church  at  Fayetteville,  which 
dates  from  July  4,  1829;  another  at  the  house  of 
Judge  Webb,  in  the  vicinity  of  Nulltown.  An  effort 
was  made  iu  the  spring  of  1830  by  the  Little  Flat 
Rock  Church  to  expel  Elder  Thompson,  but  lacking 
a  majority  it  failed,  and  a  division  of  the  church  was 
the  result,  and  from  May  23,  1830,  dates  the  organi- 
zation of  the  Little  Flat  Rock  Christian  Church. 

In  1832  Elder  John  O'Kane  settled  in  Milton,  com- 
ing from  the  village  of  Lebanon,  Ohio,  though  by 
birth  a  Virginian.  He  engaged  in  school  teaching, 
and  on  Sundays  preached  the  doctrines  of  the  Ref- 
ormation. He  was  a  co-laborer  with  Elder  Thomp- 
son, and  one  of  the  most  eloquent  preachers  of  the 
Reformation.  These  two  gentlemen  traveled  through 
eastern  Indiana,  and  made  many  converts  every- 
where, forming  the  nucleus  around  which  have  gath- 
ered the  flourishing  churches  of  to-day. 

Benjamin  F.  Reeve,  R.  T.  Brown,  George  Camp- 
bell, Elias  Stone  and  John  Langly  were  among  the 
early  preachers  of  the  Reformation  in  this  section  of 
the  country. 

SCHOOLS. 

Subscription  schools  were  the  only  schools  known 
to  the  pioneers  of  Fayette.  The  schoolhouses  were 
not  unlike  the  cabins  of  that  day;  first  was  the  round- 
log-house  with  its  puncheon  floor,  door  and  seats,  the 
latter  backless;  its  heating  apparatus,  a  huge  tii-e- 
place  in  one  end  of  the  room,  or,  perhaps,  a  contrived 
receptacle  for  tire  in  the  center  of  the  room  with  no 
exit  for  the  smoke  other  than  an  opening  in  the  roof, 
and  the  only  means  of  light  through  greased  paper. 
Next  came  the  hewed-log-house,  and  finally  the  neat 
frame   and   the   substantial    brick.     Says  a  pioneer:

"The  price  of  achooling  was  75  cents  to  $1  per 
(juurter,  and  the  schools  generulJy  lasted  throe  months 
[)er  annum,  and  the  masters  w(&gt;re  paid  in  wheat  at  37  J 
cents  per  bushel,  or  corn  at  8  or  10  cents  and  deliv- 
ered— which  was  done  on  a  sled,  very  few  having 
wagons.  In  fact,  they  had  no  use  for  any,  as  every- 
body made  his  own  sled,  and  that  was  sufficient." 

In  order  to  be  a  teacher  then,  the  person  mast  be 
able  to  teach  reading,  writing  and  arithmetic  to  the 
single  rule  of  throe.  This  was  the  standard  of  loam, 
ing  that  the  teacher  had  to  attain  in  order  to  be 
classed  as  an  educator.  It  was  plainly  to  be  under- 
stood that  the  people  of  those  times  wanted  nothing 
better. 

Under  provision  of  Congress,  one  square  mile  in 
each  Congressional  township  was  reserved  for  edu- 
cational purposes.  The  Territorial  Legislature  on 
October  26,  1808,  invested  the  Courts  of  Common 
Pleas  with  powers  to  lease  such  lands,  the  proceeds 
resulting  to  go  to  the  benefit  of  educational  enter- 
prises. By  further  enactments,  Trustees  were  ap- 
pointed to  take  charge  of  those  school  lands.  In 
1816  the  General  Assembly  passed  an  act  providing 
for  the  appointment  of  Superintendents.  Numerous 
subsequent  acts  from  time  to  time  for  the  advance- 
ment of  education  in  the  State  have  been  passed,  and 
the  result  is  the  present  high  degree  of  excellency. 
By  the  law  of  1824,  for  building  schoolhouses,  each 
voter  was  made  a  builder.  When  a  schoolhouse  was 
to  be  built,  the  people  would  meet  and  each  was 
assigned  to  some  particular  class  of  work — there  were 
choppers,  masons  (daubers),  hewers,  etc.  A  fine  of 
37^  cents  per  day  was  required  of  those  who  did  not 
work  or  pay  an  equivalent.  One  section  of  the  law 
provided  that  each  schoolhouse  should  be  eight  feet 


between  the  floors,  and  at  least  one  foot  from  the  sur- 
face of  the  ground  to  the  first  floor,  and  finished  in  a 
manner  calculated  to  render  comfortable  the  teacher 
and  pupils,  with  a  suitable  number  of  seats,  tables, 
lights,  and  everything  necessary  for  the  convenience 
of  such  schools. 

The  law  creating  the  office  of  County  Superin- 
tendent was  enacted  in  1872-73,  prior  to  which  time 
the  duties  of  that  officer  devolved  upon  the  School 
Examiners,  excepting  school  visiting. 

In  the  pioneer  day,  the  Trustee  of  the  school  dis- 
trict, by  virtue  of  his  office,  was  the  examiner  and  sole 
judge  of  the  qualifications  of  the  teacher,  and  in  all 
probability  a  majority  of  the  Trustees  wore  wholly 
incapable  of  deciding  the  merits  of  such  qualifica- 
tions; in  fact,  little  attention  was  paid  to  this  branch 
of  the  subject.  Some  years  later,  a  little  subsequent 
to  1833,  says  Uncle  Sammy  Little  ' '  when  I  taught  I 
was  examined  verbally  by  Dr.  R.  T.  Brown,  while  he 
strapped  his  razor  in  his  own  parlor." 

The  following  resolutions  were  adopted  at  a  meet- 
ing held  at  a  schoolhouse  near  Col.  Crisler's,  in  Col- 
umbia Township,  December  31, 1829,  for  the  purpose 
of  taking  into  consideration  the  practice  of  barring 
out  school  teachers  on  Christmas  and  New  Years. 
Col.  Crisler  presided;  Benjamin  Smith  acted  as  Sec 
retary,  and  Dr.  Philip  Mason  delivered  a  lecture  on 
the  subject. 

Resolved,  That  in  our  opinion  it  is  botli  immoral  and 
impolitic  to  celebrate  tlie  2.itli  day  of  December,  and  the  1st 
day  of  January,  as  is  the  practice  of  some  persons,  and  par- 
ticularly in  stopping  the  neighborhood  schools  on  those  days. 

Resoloeil,  Also,  that  it  is  the  I)ounden  duty  of  parents,  who 
are  subscribers  to  schools,  to  pre.sent,  as  far  as  is  in  their 
power,  their  cliildren  from  the  various  injurious  practice  of 
barring  out  school  teachers.

PHYSICAL  FEATURES. 

GEOGRAPHY— TOPOGRAPHY— GEOLOGY. 


FAYETTE  COUNTY  is  located  in  the  southeastern 
portion  of  the  State,  and  is  bounded  on  the 
north  by  Henry  and  Wayne  Counties,  on  the  east  by 
Union,  on  the  south  by  Franklin,  and  on  the  west  by 
Bush.  Connersville,  its  seat  of  justice,  is  in  latitude 
39°  36'  north,  and  longitude  7^  54'  west,  being  by 
rail  distant  67.2  miles  a  little  south  of  east  from 
Indianapolis,  and  57.1  northwest  of  Cincinnati,  Ohio. 
Fayette  is  one  of  the  smaller  counties  of  the  State, 
and  contains  an  area  of  211  square  miles,  as  given 
by  the  "Indiana  Gazetteer." 


TOPOGRAPHY. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  rolling  in  the  east 
and  south,  and  level  or  gently  undulating  in  the 
north  and  west,  with  a  large  proportion  of  bottoms, 
and  every  part  of  the  county  is  susceptible  of  profit- 
able cultivation.  Dense  forests  of  ash,  sugar-tree^ 
beech,  walnut,  poplar,  oak,  sycamore,  elm,  hackberry, 
buckeye  and  Cottonwood  originally  covered  most  of 
the  county,  which  is  well  watered  and  drained  by  per- 
manent streams.  The  principal  water-courses  are 
tributaries  to  the  Whitewater  River,  and  reach  that

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


river  through  the  West  Fork  of  the  same  river,  which 
is  the  largest  stream  in  the  county,  and  passes  from 
north  to  south  nearly  through  its  center. 

Of  the  several  notable  tributaries  of  West  Fork, 
Lick  Creek,  the  most  northern,  has  its  source  in 
eastern  Posey  Township,  flows  in  a  southeastern  direc- 
tion out  into  and  through  Harrison  Township,  to  a 
point  near  its  southern  boundary,  where  it  makes  a 
turn  and  flows  nearly  north  for  about  one  mile,  then 
east,  and  empties  into  West  Fork,  which  serves  as  the 
boundary  line  between  the  townships  of  Harrison  and 
Waterloo. 

The  next  water-course  south  is'  Little  Williams 
Creek,  which  has  its  source  in  Harrison  Township, 
flows  southeasterly  through  Harrison  and  Connera- 
ville  Townships,  and  joins  Williams  Creek  proper 
about  one  mile  from  the  latter's  mouth  at  West  Fork 

Williams  Creek  proper  rises  in  the  northwestern 
part  of  the  county,  flows  south  for  some  miles  through 
Posey,  Fairview  and  Harrison  Townships,  when  it 
enters  Connersville  Township  in  the  extreme  north- 
west corner,  and  takes  a  southeasterly  course  and  con- 
veys its  waters  into  West  Fork,  a  little  south  of  the 
dividing  line  between  Connersville  and  Columbia 
Townships,  at  a  point  about  five  miles  from  the 
Franklin  County  line. 

•  South  of  Williams  Creek  is  Fall  Creek,  which 
takes  its  beginning  in  the  western  part  of  the  county, 
near  the  line  dividing  Orange  and  Connersville 
Townships,  flows  east  and  joins  West  Fork.  At  the 
mouth  of  Williams  Creek,  Garrison's  Creek,  which 
is  understood  to  have  taken  its  name  from  Samuel 
Garrison,  who  settled  at  its  mouth  during  the  war  of 
J812,  being  the  first  settler  in  that  vicinity,  rises  in 
Orange  Township  in  the  western  part  of  the  county, 
flows  in  two  separate  channels  about  one  mile  apart 
in  a  southeastern  direction,  and  parallel  with  each 
other  for  as  much  as  six  miles,  when  they  unite  at  a 
point  in  southeastern  Columbia  Township,  and  con- 
tinue by  one  stream  for  about  a  mile,  where  its 
mouth  is  reached  probably  one  mile  above  Laurel,  in 
the  county  of  Franklin. 

The  tributaries  to  West  Fork  from  the  east  are 
Nolan's  Fork,  which  h.is  but  about  one  mile's  course 
in  the  county,  flowing  from  Wayne  County,  and 
waters  a  portion  of  Waterloo  Township;  Village 
Creek,  flowing  in  a  southwestern  direction  from  the 
eastern  part  of  the  county,  Jennings  Township; 
Wilson's  Creek  from  Jennings,  flowing  west  through 
Jackson  Township,  and  Bear  Creek,  nest  south, 
through  the  same  township. 

Other  than  these,  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  county, 
are  the  sources  of  Simpson's  Creek,  Turkey  Creek 
and  Ellis  Creek,  all  of  which  are  tributaries  to  the 
East  Fork  of  Whitewater,  and  drain  small    portions 


of  Waterloo,  Jennings  and  Jackson  Townships.  The 
Whitewater  River  is  a  very  rapid  stream,  having 
upon  an  average,  a  fall  of  six  feet  to  the  mile  from 
Hagerstown,  in  Wayne  County,  to  Elizabethtown,  in 
the  State  of  Ohio.  The  West  Fork  has  not  quite  so 
great  a  fall  as  this,  yet  all  along  its  course  it  affords 
an  ample  power  to  propel  almost  any  amount  of 
machinery.  It  is  said  that  in  former  times  the  stream 
was  bordered  by  trees,  and  the  water  was  so  trans- 
parent in  the  fall  and  winter,  that  the  bottom  could 
be  seen  at  a  depth  of  twenty  feet.  It  is  still  a  very 
clear  stream,  but  by  no  means  equal  to  what  it  was 
formerly.  None  of  the  streams  furnish  upon  an 
average  more  than  one-third  of  the  amount  of  water 
they  did  forty  or  fifty  years  ago.  This  failure  is 
caused  by  the  destruction  of  the  forests,  and  by 
draining  the  flat  uplands.  Whilst  the  surface  was 
covered  with  trees,  brush  and  leaves,  the  water  after 
rains  was  prevented  from  flowing  rapidly  into  the 
streams,  so  that  the  rises  were  gradual;  but  since  the 
side  hills  have  been  cleared  and  set  in  grass,  and  the 
level  lands  drained,  the  water  rushes  rapidly  into  the 
streams,  causing  great  floods,  which  wash  the  banks, 
overflowing  many  of  the  bottoms,  and  as  quickly  sub- 
side, leaving  a  deficiency  of  water  as  compared  with 
former  years.  These  floods  have  gi-eatly  marred  the 
beauty  of  the  river,  by  washing  away  the  banks  and 
leaving  great  accumulations  of  gravel  and  sand  in  its 
widened  bed.  The  Whitewater  was  once  a  navisrable 
stream  for  some  miles,  and  some  of  the  early  settlers 
were  possibly  engaged  in  trafficking  upon  its  bosom. 
There  is  a  legend  that  as  early  as  1813  the  first  Terri- 
torial Legislatiu'e  made  an  appropriation  for  improv- 
ing the  navigation  of  the  Whitewater,  and  that  W.  H. 
Eads  was  the  Commissioner  for  expending  the  money. 
Mr.  Eads  had  been  a  member  of  the  convention  from 
Franklin  County  which  had  formed  the  State  con- 
stitution, and  had  acquired  quite  a  reputation  for 
business  capacity,  and  it  is  possible  that  he  might 
have  wanted  such  an  appropriation.  It  is  within  the 
recollection  of  the  living  that  several  boats  were 
built  and  launched  at  Brookville,  but  as  to  their  size, 
description,  and  whether  any  ever  succeeded  in  get- 
tinw  out  of  the  river,  the  writer  has  no  knowledge. 

In  support  of  the  statement  that  the  river  was 
navigable,  it  was  recorded  and  classified  as  such  in  a 
Geography  and  History  of  the  Western  States,  pub- 
lished in  1828,  wherein  the  number  of  miles  of  navi- 
gation was  given  as  forty.  The  following  description 
of  the  river  was  given  in  that  work: 

"  Whitewater  is  a  branch  of  the  Big  Miami,  and 
is  a  very  interesting  river.  It  rises  near  Fort  Green- 
ville, in  Ohio.  Not  far  from  its  source  it  crosses  in- 
to Indiana,  and  in  its  devious  course  waters  a  large 
extent  of  fertile  country.       The  West    Fork   unites 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


55 


with  it  at  Brookville,  thirty  miles  above  its  entrance 
into  the  Miami.  This  beautiful  stream  is  supposed 
to  water  nearly  1,000,000  acres  of  land.  It  abounds 
in  fine  lish,  and  exceeds  all  other  rivers  of  the  coun- 
try in  the  unusual  transparency  of  its  waters.  It 
has  its  source  in  copious  springs,  and  its  waters  are 
uncommonly  cold.  The  people  in  its  vicinity  have 
an  idea  that  its  waters  are  too  much  wanting  in  spe- 
cific gravity,  or  from  other  causes_too  little  buoyant, 
for  ordinary  swimmers  to  trust  themselves  to  bathe 
in." 

In  further  support  of  the  early  navigation  of  the 
Whitewater,  we  quote  from  the  notes  of  Rev.  Thomas 
Goodwin: 

"  One  of  the  early  acts  of  the  Territorial  Legisla- 
ture was  to  make  the  Whitewater  a  '  navigable 
stream.'  This  was  done  as  early  as  February,  1813. 
This  may  provoke  a  smile,  but  the  West  Fork  up  to 
the  vicinity  of  Waterloo,  and  the  East  Fork  to  Dun- 
lapsville,  were  navigable,  and  sent  out  many  a  cargo 
of  produce  that  floated  to  New  Orleans." 

In  the  earlier  history  of  the  country  there  was  a 
lake  or  pond  of  considerable  size  located  in  the  north- 
ern part  of  the  county,  in  Sections  31  and  6,  Town 
15,  Range  13  east,  which,  according  to  a  published 
account  in  1833,  covered  some  sixty  or  seventy  acres, 
and  was  then  fed  by  a  small  stream,  but  from  which 
issued  no  stream  except  during  the  spring  freshets. 
This  body  of  water,  by  drainage  and  evaporation,  has 
long  since  disappeared. 

The  summit  west  of  Big  Williams  Creek  is  the 
highest  point  of  land  on  the  Cincinnati,  Hamilton  &amp; 
Indianapolis  Railroad,  between  Hamilton,  Ohio,  and 
Indianapolis,  Ind.  Its  elevation  above  tide-water  is 
1,126.68  feet. 

The  following  table  will  exhibit  the  elevations  of 
land  at  different  points  in  the  county.  For  the  pur- 
pose of  comparison  the  elevations  of  several  points  in 
adjoining  counties  are  given.  The  altitudes  as  given

GEOLOGY. 

The  dividing  ridge  in  the  counties  of  Switzerland, 
Dearborn,  Franklin,  Union  and  Fayette,  between  the 
waters  of  the  W^ abash  and  those  of  the  Ohio,  may  be 
considered  the  eastern  boundary  of  the  magnesian 
limestone  group  of  Upper  SiluriaUj  date.  On  the 
western  borders  of  Fayette  and  Franklin  Counties 
these  rocks  are  occasionally  to  be  seen;  but  the 
greater  part  of  these  two  counties,  as  well  as  the 
whole  of  Switzerland,  Dearborn  and  Union,  is  occu- 
pied by  the  inferior  blue,  fossiliferous,  shell  lime- 
stones and  alternating  marls.  These  rise  to  their 
highest  elevation  near  the  eastern  limit  of  Indiana, 
and  decline  toward  the  east  as  they  pass  into  Ohio. 

These  counties  are  remarkably  interesting  to  the 
geologist  on  account  of  the  numerous  marine  fossils 
found  imbedded  in  the  blue  limestone  formation. 
Some  of  them  are  in  a  wonderful  state  of  preserva- 
tion, and  so  abundant  that  the  rock  is  almost  an  ag- 
glutinated mass  of  marine  shells  and  corals,  which 
lived,  died  and  became  entombed  in  the  sediments 
and  precipitates  forming  in  the  ocean  durincr  the 
earliest  period  to  which  geologists  are  able  to  trace 
back  organic  existences. 

The  county  of  Fayette  is  of  both  the  Upper  and 
Lower  Silurian  formation.  A  little  more  than  the 
western  half  of  its  territory  is  of  the  Upper  Silurian 
while  some  less  than  the  eastern  half  is  of  the  Lower 
Silurian.  The  soils  of  the  latter  formation  are  most 
excellent  for  the  growing  of  what  is  known  as  the 
famous  blue-grass  of  Kentucky.  This  can  be  made 
a  most  profitable  crop  in  such  formation,  hence  let 
the  farmer  of  eastern  Fayette  experiment  more  largely 
in  its   production. 

During  the  years  1859-60  there  was  made  under 
the  direction  of  the  late  David  Dale  Owen,  M.  D., 
State  Geologist,  by  Richard  Owen,  M.  D.,  then  Prin- 
cipal Assistant,  afterward  State  Geologist,  a  Geolog- 
ical Reconnoissance  of  Indiana,  from  the  report  of 
which  the  following  pertaining  to  Fayette  County 
is  extracted:  "Passing  from  the  northern  line  of  the 
county  toward  Connersville,  the  county  seat,  we  trav- 
eled through  parts  of  the  valley  of  Whitewater  to 
extensive  bottoms  rising  into  gentle  and  undulating 
drift  elevations,  exhibiting  fine  farms  and  the  pros- 
pect of  abundant  corn  crops.  Near  town  the  osage 
hedges  betokened  high  cultivation,  and  the  mill 
race  with  extensive  buildings  indicated  where  a  part, 
at  least,  of  their  staple  product,   wheat,  receives  its 


56 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


preparation  for  the  flour  market.  Pork  and  beef 
are  also  largely  produced  in  this  county.  Although 
the  soil  in  places  appeared  clayey,  indicated  by  the 
ponds  along  the  roadsides,  yet  it  was  susceptible  of 
pulverization  by  the  harrow,  and  the  wheat  which  on 
the  19th  of  September  (the  day  we  passed  through 
Connersville)  had  already  been  put  in  on  several 
farms,  was  much  of  it  drilled,  and  in  excellent  order. 
This  system  of  drilliagwheat  appears  to  be  rapidly 
gaining  in  the  estimation  of  our  farming  community, 
as  rendering  it  less  liable  to  freeze  out  besides  saving, 
seed  and  distributing  it  more  rapidly  than  even  a  long 
experience  in  broad-cast  sowing  can  possibly  secure. 
"The  prevailing  timber  is  oak  and  beech,  occa- 
sionally thinned  out  so  as  to  form  fine  wood  pastures, 
in  which  the  blue-grass  (*Poapraten8is)  thrives  kindly. 
"Building  materials  are  abundant,  rock  being 
extensively  quarried  in  tolerably  heavy  layers  at  sev- 
eral places  near  the  county  line  of  Franklin,  and 
across  the  line  at  Somerset  as  well  as  on  Williams 
Creek,  near  which  locality  they  also  manufacture 
hydraulic  cement  from  limestone. 

"Adjoining  Williams  Creek  two  or  three  miles 
west  of  Connersville,  we  found  in  about  twenty-five 
feet,  vertical  thickness,  of  blue  limestone,  inter- 
spersed with  martite,  abundant  samples  of  the  follow- 
ing fossils:  Choetetes  petropolitanus,  Streptelasma 
corniculum,  Rhynchonella,  (Atrypa)  increbescens, 
Sti-ophonsena  (Leptpena)  Alternata,  S.  planumvona, 
Leptoena  sericea,  Orthistestudinaria,  portions  of  caly- 
menesenaria,  and  of  Asaphus  canalis,  (Isotelusgigas). 
"  In  traveling  toward  the  extreme  western  limit  of 
Fayette,  about  four  and  a  half  miles  from  the  Rush 
County  line,  wo  found  at  a  deep,  natural  cut  a  tine 
exposure  of  the  upper  members  in  the  Lower  Silurian 
formation,  surrounded  by  a  reddish  Silico-calcareous 
rock,  apparently  of  Upper  Silurian  age,  although  we 
failed  to  find  any  fossils  in  it." 

[In  this  natural  exposure  of  110  feet  these  gen- 
tlemen made  an  examination  of  the  succession  of 
strata,  which  is  illustrated  by  plates  not  here  found 
practicable  to  give,  but  an  examination  made  near 
Connersville  revealed  the  following  strata  in  the  de- 
scending order:  Three  feet  of  soil,  twenty-five  feet 
of  gravel,  ten  feet  of  sand,  six  feet  of  blue  clay  and 
twenty  feet  of  bowlders  intermingled  with  gravel.] 

*  The  less  comnioD  blue-grass  of  botanists  is  poe  compressia. 


"  vSoon  after  passing  this  locality  we  ascended 
still  higher,  over  coarse  gravel  and  bowlders,  to 
about  the  highest  land  in  the  State,  the  barometer  at 
2  P.  M.  falling  to  28.97  inches,  although  it  stood  a 
few  hours  before  at  29.28  at  Connersville.  Allowing 
that  it  had  fallen,  as  it  often  does  in  the  afternoon, 
about  two-hundredths,  still  we  had  ascended  270 
feet  after  leaving  Connersville.  We  continued  some 
time  on  this  elevated  plateau  with  but  little  variation 
in  the  barometer,  passing  some  very  tine  farms  and  a 
dense  growth  of  large  beech,  sugar  maple  and  oak 
timber,  with  pawpaw  undergrowth  even  beyond 
Vienna,  the  western  limit  of  the  county,  that  town  be- 
ing built  in  Rush  up  to  the  Fayette  line. 

"  We  readily  perceive  from  observation  that  a 
great  portion  of  the  surface  soil  in  this  county  is 
drift,  amounting  sometimes  to  fifty  or  sixty  feet  in 
vertical  thickness,  which  has  thus  greatly  modi- 
fied the  soil  from  that  of  pure  Upper  Silurian 
detritus. 

"  On  portions  of  this  plateau  there  is  a  deficiency 
of  running  water  for  stock,  although  a  supply  is  ob- 
tained on  many  portions  of  the  elevation  by  digging 
ten  or  fifteen  feet  through  bluish  clay,  when  they 
reach  gravel  and  usually  find  water  in  that  or  the 
sand  overlying  an  impervious  substratum.  It  is  com- 
monly hard,  because  during  filtration  through  the 
superincumbent  drift  the  water  encounters  fragments 
of  limestone.  Notwithstanding  some  inconvenience, 
on  this  score  of  a  scarce  supply  in  dry  seasons,  there 
are  farmhouses  on  the  plateau  in  Fayette  and  the  ad 
joining  county  of  Rush  as  tine  as  any  we  saw  in  the 
State.  Some  of  them  could  have  not  cost  less  than 
$4,000  or  $5,000.  The  style  of  architecture  is  elab 
orate  and  sometimes  highly  ornamental. 

Along  the  river  bottoms  the  soil  of  Fayette  is 
rich  and  productive,  composed  largely  of  vegetable 
matter  or  humus,  with  clay,  sand  and  lime;  in  fact, 
all  the  elements  of  fertility.  These  lands  have  im- 
mense crops  of  corn  for  years.  The  constant  crop- 
ping in  corn,  however,  is  perceptibly  exhausting 
them,  and  points  out  the  necessity  of  a  rotation  In 
crops  and  the  application  of  fertilizers  if  they  are 
;  expected  to  maintain  their  fertility.  The  uplands 
are  of  clayey  soils  mixed  with  sand  and  gravel,  on 
which,  by  good  culture,  rotating  crops  and  subsoiling, 
fair  crops  are  produced.

CHAPTER   VI. 


CIVIL  ORGANIZATION  OF  THE  COUNTY. 

BOUNDARIES— LOCATION  OF  THE  COUNTY  SEAT— COUNTY  BUILDINGS. 


FAYETTE  COUNTY  was  established  by  an  act  of 
the  General  Assembly  of  the  State  of  Indiana 
approved  December  28,  1818,  and  named  at  the  same 
time  in  honor  of  Gen.  Lafayette.  The  act  creating 
the  county  took  effect  January  1,  1819,  and  with  this 
date  the  history  of  the  county  as  a  civil  division 
begins. 

The  county  was  formed  of  territory  taken  princi- 
pally from  the  counties  of  Wayne  and  Franklin&gt; 
which  counties  were  created  at  the  same  time  by  an 
act  of  the  Assembly  of  Indiana  Territory  passed 
November  27,  1810,  to  take  effect  from  February  1, 
1811. 

Going  another  step  backward,  the  counties  of 
Wayne  and  Franklin  were  formed  from  Dearborn  and 
Clark,  which  originally  embraced  a  large  scope  of 
country,  out  of  which  many  counties  were  subse- 
quently formed. 

The  western  boundaries  of  Wayne  and  Franklin 
Counties  was  the  western  boundary  line  of  the  "Twelve- 
Mile  Purchase,"  which  boundary  line  with  reference 
to  Fayette  County  as  it  is  at  present,  extended  from  a 
point  in  the  northeastern  corner  of  Posey  Township, 
about  a  quarter  of  a  mile  west  of  the  eastern  bound- 
ary of  the  township,  in  a  southwest  diagonal  direc- 
tion, passing  through  the  townships  of  Posey,  Har- 
rison, Connersville,  Columbia  and  Orange,  to  a  point 
on  the  northern  boundary  lino  of  Franklin  County  as 
it  is  to-day,  a  half  mile  west  of  the  eastern  boundary 
of  Orange  Township.  The  line  dividing  the  counties 
of  Wayne  and  Franklin,  as  designated  in  the  act, 
corresponded  with  the  line  which  at  present  separates 
Connersville  and  Harrison  Townships,  and  Waterloo 
and  Jennings  Townships. 

BOUNDABIES  OF  FAYETTE  COUNTY. 

Act  approved  December  28,  1818. 

Section  1. — Be  it  enacted  by  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
State  of  Indiana,  that  from  and  after  the  first  day  of  January 
next  all  that  tract  or  parcel  of  country  which  is  enclosed  within 
the  following  boundaries  shall  constitute  and  form  a  new  coun- 
ty to  be  known  and  designated  by  the  name  and  style  of  the 
county  of  Fayette,  to  wit,  beginning  at  the  southeast  corner 
of  Section  33,  Township  13,  Range  13,  thence  north  three 
miles,  thence  east  three  miles  to  the  old  boundary  line;  thence 
north  to  fractions  28  and  33.  in  Township  1.5,  Range  14,  east 
of  the  second  principal  meridian;  thence  west  on  said  line  to 


a  line  dividing  Sections  27  and  28  in  Township  15,  Range  12, 
east  of  the  second  principal  meridian;  thence  nortli  on  said 
line  to  a  line  dividing  Town.ships  15  and  16;  thence  west  six 
miles;  thence  south  eighteen  miles;  thence  east  so  far  as  to 
intersect  the  line  dividing  Townships  12  and  13;  thence  along 
said  line  east  to  the  place  of  beginning. 

From  the  boundaries  above  described  it  will  be 
observed  by  comparison  that  the  county  when  formed 
was  minus  the  strip  of  country  it  now  possesses  in 
eastern  Jackson  south  of  Jennings,  extending  two 
miles  east  and  west  and  three  miles  north  and  south; 
and  its  eastern  boundary  was  the  "  Old  Boundary 
Line,"  or,  as  it  is  sometimes  called,  the  "  Indian 
Boundary."  In  1821.  when  Union  County  was  created, 
the  territory  east  of  the  present  eastern  boundary  line 
of  Fayette  lying  between  said  eastern  boundary  and 
the  "Old  Boundary  Line  "  was  given  to  Union.  By 
an  act  approved  January  16,  1826,  the  strip  of  terri- 
tory heretofore  referred  to  in  eastern  Jackson  Town- 
ship was  attached  to  Fayette. 

So  much  of  the  territory  of  Fayette  County  as  it 
now  exists,  as  lies  east  of  the  western  boundary  line 
of  the  "Twelve-Mile  Purchase,"  and  north  of  the  line 
dividing  Harrison  and  Connersville  Townships,  and 
the  townships  of  Waterloo  and  Jennings,  extending 
to  the  eastern  boundary  line  of  the  county,  was  taken 
from  Wayne  County;  that  portion  south  between  the 
western  and  eastern  boundaries  as  above  described 
from  Franklin  County,  and  all  territory  west  of  the 
western  boundary  line  of  the  "Twelve-Mile  Purchase," 
from  the  "  New  Purchase." 

LOCATING    THE    COUNTY    SEAT. 

Section  3  of  the  act  of  the  General  Assembly 
creating  the  county,  made  provision  for  its  seat  of 
justice  and  appointed  William  Bradley,  of  the 
County  of  Switzerland;  James  Dill  and  John  Watts, 
of  Dearborn  County;  Williamson  Dunn,  of  Jefferson 
County,  and  John  F.  Boss,  of  Clark  County,  Com- 
missioners, for  the  purpose  of  locating  the  same. 
They  were  to  convene  at  the  house  of  John  McCormac, 
in  Fayette  County,  on  the  third  Monday  of  February, 
1819.  These  five  Commissioners  assembled  at  the 
house  designated,  February  16,  1819,  but  adjourned 
without  accomplishing  the  object  in  view,  however. 
On  the  day  following  they  again  Convened  and  ' '  pro-

off  and  recorded  by  John  Conner  and  Joshua  Harlan, 
and  as  by  the  plat  of  said  town.  Permanent  seat  of 
justice  declared  as  above,  and  fixed,  February  17»

COUNTY    BDILDINGS. 

First  Jail. — At  a  special  meeting  of  the  Board  of 
Commissioners,  held  March  6,  1819,  it  was  ordered 
that  "there  shall  be  a  jail  built  and  erected  on  the 
public  square  on  which  the  seat  of  justice  is  estab- 
lished, in  the  town  of  Connersville,  in  and  for  the 
county  of  Fayette,  and  on  the  west  side  of  an  alley 
running  through  said  public  square,  nearly  in  a 
north  and  south  direction,  at  or  next  to  where  the 
schoolhouse  now  stands;  which  said  jail  shall  be 
built  on  the  following  plan:  to  be  built  with  logs 
thirty  feet  long  by  sixteen,  hewn  to  a  square  twelve 
inches  thick;  two  partition  walls  of  logs  of  the  same 
size;  floor  and  loft  to  be  laid  of  logs  of  the  same  size 
aforesaid,  the  middle  room  to  be  twelve  feet  in  the 
clear,  the  other  two  rooms  seven  feet  each  in  the 
clear;  the  logs  out  of  which  said  jail  is  to  be  built 
to  be  of  good  sound  oak,  cherry,  red  elm,  honey 
locust,  or  ash  timber;  the  logs,  when  said  jail  is 
raised,  to  be  let  in  by  a  half  dovetail  in  such  a  man- 
ner as  to  let  the  logs  as'near  together  as  they  conven- 
iently can  be;  the  upper  and  lower  floor  to  be  laid 
80  as  the  timbers  will  touch  from  end  to  end;  to  be 
under-framed  with  good  stone,  one  foot  under  ground 
and  one  foot  above  the  surface  of  the  ground;  each 
room  of  said  jail  to  be  ceiled  inside  except  the  under 
part  of  the  upper  floor,  with  oak  plank  an  inch  and  a 
half  in  thickness,  well  seasoned,  and  not  to  exceed 
twelve  inches  in  width,  and  to  be  well  spiked  with 
iron  spikes  at  least  four  inches  in  length  and  not  less 
than  eleven  to  each  plank;  said  jail  to  be  at  least 
nine  feet  between  the  floors,  and  one  round  of  logs 
above  the  upper  floor,  as  before  mentioned,  on  which 
upper  round  of  logs  the  rafters  shall  so  far  be  pro- 
jected as  to  give  an  eave  twelve  inches  clear  of  the 
wall;  said  jail  to  be  covered  with  poplar  joint  shin- 
gles not  exceeding  eighteen  inches  in  length;  two 
outside  doors  and  one  on  the  inside,  the  doors  to  be 
made  out  of  oak  plank,  one  inch  and  a  half  in  thick- 
ness, well  doubled  and  spiked  with  spikes  at  least 
four  inches  in  length,  to  be  placed  not  to  exceed  four 
inches  apart  and  clinched  in  the  inside  of  each  door; 


each  door  to  be  two  feet  in  width,  two  iron  bars  to 
be  fixed  to  each  outside  door,  which  bars  to  be  one- 
half  inch  by  two  inches,  one  end  of  each  bar  to  be 
fastened  to  the  logs  on  each  side  of  the  door  by  a 
staple,  and  the  other  end  to  be  locked  to  a  staple  on 
the  opposite  side  of  the  door;  one  window  to  be  in 
each  room,  twelve  inches  by  eighteen  in  size,  iron 
grates,  of  an  inch  and  a  quarter  in  size,  fixed  in  each 
window,  two  inches  apart,  said  grates  to  be  well 
plastered  in  at  least  three  inches  on  the  upper  and 
lower  part  of.  each  of  said  windows;  said  jail  doors 
to  be  well  hung  with  good  and  sufficient  strap  hinges; 
the  whole  of  the  work  on  said  jail  to  be  done  in  a 
workmanlike  manner. 

"  The  building  of  this  jail  is  to  be  set  up  and 
offered  at  public  sale  and  outcry  to  the  lowest  bidder 
at  the  public  square  in  the  town  of  Connersville  on 
the  13th  day  of  this  instant  *  *  *  to  be 
completed  by  the  first  day  of  September  next  at  the 
expense  of  the  county."  The  Sheriff  was  to  attend 
to  the  selling  of  it.  The  contract  was  let  to  Jonathan 
John  and  the  building  was  completed  within  the  time 
specified.  The  jail  was  examined  and  accepted  by 
the  Commissioners  in  August,  1819,  and  the  contrac- 
tors allowed  $704  for  its  construction. 

First   Court    House. — In   November,    1819,     the 
Commissioners  agreed  upon  a  plan  for  a  coiu-t  house. 
The  building  was  to  be  constructed  of  brick,  and  to 
be  forty  feet  square  and  two  stories  high — the  first 
story  eighteen    feet  high,    the  second    fourteen   feet 
high.     The  front  half  of  the  lower   floor  was  to  be 
constructed  of  brick,  and  the  other  half  of  oak  or  ash 
plank,  one  inch  and  a  quarter  thick,    and  not  more 
than  eight  inches  in  width.      The  second  floor  was  to 
be  laid  with  oak  or  ash  plank  of  the  same  description 
as  the  rear  half  of  the  lower  floor.     In   the  first  story 
there  were  to  be  three  windows  in  each  side  and  end, 
except  in  front,  where  in  the  center  of  the   building 
there  were  to  be   folding  doors,  with   a  window  on 
either  side.    The  windows  were  each  to  have  twenty- 
four   lights,  8x10    inches    in   size,  and   the    window 
which   was    to   be  immediately    behind    the  Judge's 
bench  was  to  be  two  and   one-half  feet  higher  than 
the   other    windows.     On    each    side  of  the   second 
story  there  were  to  be  three  windows  of   the  same 
size  and    description  as   those   given    above.     There 
were  to  be  two  fire-places  below  in  the  southwest  and 
northwest  corners  of  the   building,    and  three  tire- 
places  in  the  second  story.    Two  girders  (14x12   feet) 
were  to  extend  through  the  center  of  the  house  (one 
above    and  one  below)  from  side  to  side,  equidistant 
from  either  side  of  the  house,  each   to  be  supported 
by  two  columns,  which  were  to  be  well  turned  and 
round,  and  thirteen  inches  in  diameter  at  the  bottom, 
and  proportionally  small  at  the  top.     The  roof  was 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


59 


to  bo  pitched  from  each  side  to  the  center,  from 
whence  was  to  be  raised  a  cupola,  eight  feet  in  diam- 
eter, and  thirty-two  feet  in  height  from  its  pedestal; 
from  the  top  of  the  cupola  was  to  extend  a  spire  ten 
feet  high.  A  handsomely  gilded  ball  fifteen  inches 
in  diameter,  and  a  neat  vane  were  to  ornament  the 
spire;  above  the  vane  was  to  be  extended  across  the 
spire  a  bar  with  a  gilt  ball  on  each  side,  and  a  neat 
cap  was  to  be  placed  on  the  top  of  the  spire. 

Returning  to  the  interior  of  the  building,  we 
mention  that  through  the  center  of  the  house  on  the 
ground  floor,  and  along  the  edge  of  the  wooden  floor, 
was  to  be  a  hand  rail  and  banisters,  and  immediately 
under  the  middle  window  in  the  rear  side  of  the  house 
was  to  be  raised  a  bench,  for  the  Judges  of  the  court, 
two  and  one-half  feet  from  the  floor  — the  bench  to  be 
banistered,  and  the  stairway  to  ascend  thereto  was 
also  to  be  banistered.  This  room  was  to  be  provided 
with  jury  boxes,  a  criminal  box  and  other  requisites. 
On  the  second  floor  there  was  to  be  a  partition  across 
the  house  from  north  to  south,  the  west  portion  of 
which  was  to  be  divided  into  two  rooms,  and  the  east 
half  of  that  floor  was  also  to  be  divided  by  a  parti- 
tion. The  walls  were  to  be  painted  and  penciled, 
the  roof  painted  Spanish  brown  color,  the  cupola 
white,  and  the  whole  of  the  interior  of  the  building 
of  the  latter  color,  excepting  the  Judge's  bench,  jury 
boxes  and  banisters,  which  were  to  be  painted  blue. 
The  contract  for  the  erection  of  the  building  was  to 
be  sold  by  the  Sheriff,  on  the  last  Saturday  in  Novem- 
ber, 1819.  It  appears  that  this  contractor  was  Jona- 
than John,  as  the  building  was  accepted  by  the  Com- 
missioners from  him  in  August,  1822,  and  the  total 
amount  paid  him  was  $1,262.50. 

This  building  was  one  among  the  early  brick 
structures  of  Fayette  County.  It  stood  on  the  center 
front  of  the  public  square  fronting  to  the  east,  and  was 
the  court  house  of  the  county  for  nearly  thirty  years. 

First  Clerk  and  Recorder's  Office.  — In  September, 
1825,  the  Board  of  Justices  of  the  Peace  authorized 
Jonathan  McCarty  to  erect  a  building  for  the  offices 
of  the  Clerk  and  Recorder.  We  fail  to  find  anything 
of  record  showing  to  whom  the  contract  was  let,  or 
when  the  house  was  constructed;  however,  in  March, 
1827,  Mr.  McCarty  was  allowed  the  sum  of  $220. 40J 
for  having  erected  such  building — so  much  of  it  as 
was  then  completed.  We  are  informed  that  the  build- 
ing stood  on  the  northwest  corner"  of  the  public 
square  and  had  but  two  comisartments,  and  that  the 
amount  above  named  would  have  erected  such  a  struct- 
ure, so  it  is  quite  likely  that  the  house  was  about 
completed  when  that  sum  was  allowed.  It  was  con- 
structed of  wood. 

Second  Clerk  and  Recorder's  Office. — This  was  a 
one-story  brick  building,   36x20  feet,   and  stood  on 


the  southeast  corner  of  the  public  square.  It  had  two 
rooms  and  was  constructed  by  Sherman  Scofield. 
Gabriel  Ginn  was  appointed  by  the  Commissioners,  at 
the  May  meeting,  1833,  to  superintend  the  erection  of 
the  building. 

Second  Jail. — The  question  of  a  new  county  prison 
seems  to  have  been  agitated  in  the  spring  of  1834, 
for  in  May  of  that  year  the  Commissioners  offered  a 
prize  of  $10  to  the  one  who  would  furnish  the  best 
model  for  jail  of  three  rooms.  John  Sample,  Jr., 
was  awarded  the  prize,  and  one  of  Fayette  County's 
distinguished  citizens — the  Hon.  Samuel  W.  Parker 
— was  allowed  $3  for  "getting  the  model."  At  the 
fall  term  of  the  Circuit  Court  the  Judges  recommend- 
ed the  refitting  of  the  old  jail  after  a  plan  submitted 
by  Elijah  Corbin.  However,  this  was  not  done,  for 
in  November,  1834,  Gabriel  Ginn  and  George  Fry- 
barger  were  appointed  agents  to  superintend  the  build- 
ing of  a  county  jail,  and  to  enter  into  a  contract  with 
Philip  Mason  after  the  model  for  a  jail  heretofore 
submitted  by  Philip  Mason. 

The  building  was  constructed  of  brick,  was  a 
story  and  a  half  high,  having  three  apartments,  two 
below  and  one  above.  It  stood  on  the  south  side  of 
the  public  square,  and  was  erected  at  a  cost  of  $800. 
This  was  the  county  prison  until  1849. 

Second  Court  House,  First  Jailer's  Residence  and 
Third  Jail. — This,  the  present  court  house,  was 
completed  as  a  court  house,  jailer's  residence  and  jail, 
and  received  by  the  Commissioners  November  12, 
1849.  In  June,  1847,  the  Commissioners  of  the 
county  entered  into  an  agreement  with  John  Elder, 
of  Marion  County,  Ind.,  for  the  construction  of  the 
building,  which  was  to  be  completed  on  or  before  Oc- 
tober, 1849,  in  consideration  for  which  they  were  to 
pay  Mr.  Elder  $20,000.  The  "Indiana  Gazetteer" 
published  the  year  that  the  building  was  completed 
thus  speaks  of  it:  "It  is  one  of  the  most  spacious, 
convenient,  and  substantial  buildings  of  its  kind  in 
the  State, — all  the  county  offices  are  located  on  the 
first  floor,  in  good  sized  office  rooms.  In  connection 
with  each  office  are  ample  tire  proof  rooms  for  the 
security  of  their  books  and  papers.  The  court  room, 
jurors'  rooms  (of  which  there  are  four)  are  all  on  the 
upper  story.  In  the  rear  of  the  center  building  there 
is  attached  a  wing  two  stories  high,  which  are  con- 
structed six  dormitories,  or  cells,  for  prisoners.  The 
prisoners  can  be  taken  to  and  from  the  court  from  a 
rear  passage  by  a  door  entering  immediately  into  the 
court  room." 

The  building  is  constructed  of  brick  and  stands 
on  the  public  square  facing  the  east.  In  1881  im- 
provements to  the  extent  of  about  $8,000  were  made 
upon  the  interior  of  the  building;  the  jail  was  taken 
out  and  the  space  converted  into  rooms  for  the  use  of

the  county;  alterations  were  made  in  the  court-room, 
with  other  minor  changes  in  the  building. 

The  following  facts  concerning  the  public  square 
and  county  buildings  that  have  been  located  thereon 
may  be  of  interest  to  some: 

The  old  locust  trees  that  stood  in  the  court  house 
yard  and  about  the  public  square,  and  which  for  near- 
ly a  half  century  beautified  the  grounds  and  furnished 
in  the  heated  season  refreshing  shade,  were  planted  in 
the  spring  of  1835.  Their  removal  took  place  in  De- 
cember, ISSl. 

In  January,  1849,  the  old  court  house,  Clerk  and 
Recorder's  ofHce  (second)  and  the  old  jail  were  sold 
by  the  Commissioners.  The  court  house  and  jail 
were  pui'chased  by  A.  B.  Conwell  for  S575;  and  the 
other  building  by  Sherman  Scolield  for  §96. 

The  bell  that  was  suspended  in  the  old  court 
house  was  sold  to  the  Presbyterian  Church  for  §117. 

In  June,  18-19,  Hemy  Goodlander  and  John  El- 
der were  appointed  a  committee  to  purchase  a  bell 
and  clock  for  the  new  court  house,  and  for  that  pur- 
pose there  was  appropriated  S600. 

Fourth  Jail  and  Slieriff''s  Residence. — This  beauti- 
ful two-story  brick  building  with  highly  ornamented 
stone  trimmings  is  located  on  Fourth  Street,  opposite 
the  court  house,  and  faces  the  north.  The  rear  of  the 
building  forms  the  jail,  which  with  the  basement  or 
cellar  is  three  stories  high;  underground  is  the  dun- 
geon, consisting  of  a  cell  about  ten  feet  square. 
On  the  ground  floor  is  one  apartment,  in  size  about 
3(3x31feet,  and  contains  four  cells;  above  are  locat- 
ed six  cells,  two  of  which  are  for  females.  The  con- 
tract for  the  construction  of  this  building  was 
awarded  to  J.  W.  Perkinson,  of  Indianapolis,  May  3, 
1880,  for  $14,900.  The  architect  was  E.  J.  Hodson. 
The  house  was  completed  and  occupied  in  the  spring 
of  1881. 

Poor  Asylum. — Until  1836  the  paupers  in  Fay- 
ette, Union  and  Franklin  Counties  were  under  the 
charge  of  township  officers,  who  let  the  contract  for 
the  maintenance  of  the  unfortunate  poor  to  the  low- 
est responsible  bidder.  On  the  26th  of  December, 
1834,  the  Commissioners  of  the  three  counties  named 
met  at  Fairfield,  in  Franklin  County,  for  the  purpose 
of  jointly  erecting  an  asylum  for  the  poor  of  the  three 
counties.  Subsequently  a  farm  located  in  Jackson 
Township,  Fayette  County,  was  purchased  of  Thomas 


Clark,  and  the  Commissioners  met  thereon,  August  10, 
1835,  and  agreed  "to  build  an  asylum,  to  be  in  readi- 
ness by  the  first  Monday  in  May  next  (1830)."  The 
building  was  to  be  of  brick.  It  was  completed|and  the 
farm  let  to  the  highest  bidder. 

May  9,  1836,  Isaac  Gardner,  of  Union  County, 
was  chosen  as  Superintendent  of  the  institution  at  a 
salary  of  1500  a  year.  The  first  Board  of  Directors 
were  Joseph  D.  Thompson,  Martin  Williams  and 
Zachariah  Ferguson.  The  paupers  of  Fayette  Coun- 
ty were  ordered  removed  from  the  several  townships 
to  the  asylum  in  May,  1830.  The  total  expense  of 
keeping  up  the  asylum  for  the  year  1836,  and  up  to 
February  9,  1837,  was  §1,709.41  J^.     From  February 

9,  1837,  to  March  6,  1S3S,  the  total  expense  of  the 
asylum  was  $1,040.15^,  of  which  amount  Fayette 
County's  apportionment  was  S349.03|.  Among  the 
early  Superintendents  of  the  asylum  while  controlled 
by  the  three  counties,  and  in  the  order  given,  were 
Isaac  Gardner,  William  Riggsby  and  William  Bai-n- 
ard,  each  serving  several  yeai^s. 

In  June,  1856,  the  Commissioners  of  Union  Coun- 
ty purchased  the  interest  in  the  farm  ]of  the  coun- 
ties of  Fayette  and  Franklin  for  the  consideration  of 
§3,210.66  and  §3,696.52  to  those  counties  respect- 
ively, their  paupers  to  be  removed  on  or  before  March 

10,  1857. 

In  September,  1856,  the  Commissioners  of  Fay- 
ette County  having  purchased  a  portion  of  the  pres- 
ent infirmary  farm,  contracted  with  Sherman  Scofield 
for  the  erection  of  a  poor-house  building  thereon, 
for  §7,000,  to  be  done  on  or  before  June,  1857.  The 
present  large  and  commodious  two-story  brick  struct- 
ure was  received  from  Mr.  Scofield  in  August,  1857. 
Several  tracts  of  land  have  since  been  added  to  the 
farm,  which  lies  on  the'ridge  northwest  of  the  city 
and  commands  a  most  beautiful  view,  imtil  it  now 
comprises  173  acres  of  land.  On  either  side  of  the 
main  building  is  a  large  wing  and  beneath  a  spacious 
basement  or  cellar. 

The  total  expense  of  keeping  up  the  institution 
from  March  1,  1S5S.  to  March  1,  1859,  was  §996.99. 
The  first  Superintendent  of  the  asylum  of  Fayette 
County  was  William  Custer.  His  successor  was 
Peter  Reed,  since  which  the  Superintendents  have 
been  as  follows:  William  Custer,  P.  A.  Morse,  Jacob 
Ridge  and  John  B.  Salyer,  the  present  incumbent.

OF  THE  PEACE— COUNTY  GOVERNMENT  AND  EARLY  PROCEEDINGS— COUNTY  COMMISSIONERS. 


THE  history  of  Fayette  County  as  a  civil  division 
began  January  1,  1819. 

Tlie  first  term  of  the  Circuit  Court  was  held 
in  Connersville,  beginning  May  3,  1819.  Present, 
John  Watts,  President  Judge;  Train  Caldwell  and 
Edward  Webb,  Associate  Judges  for  the  County 
of  Fayette.  John  Watts  produced  his  commission 
as  Circuit  Judge  of  the  Third  Circuit  of  the  State  of 
Indiana,  on  which  was  endorsed  the  oath  of  office. 

Jonathan  McCarty  produced  his    commission  as 
Clerk  of  the  Fayette  Circuit  Court,  on  which  was  en- 
dorsed his  oath  of  office. 

William  W.  Wick,  James  Noble,  John  Test,  Will- 
iam C.  Drew,  D.  J.  Caswell,  James  B.  Ray,  James 
Rariden  and  Nathaniel  French  were  admitted  to  prac- 
tice as  attorneys  and  counsellors  at  law  in  this  court. 

William  W.  Wick  was  appointed  Prosecuting 
Attorney  for  the  county,  and  took  the  oath  of  office. 
Isaac  Johnson  was  admitted  in  gratia  for  the  pres- 
ent term  to  practice  as  attorney  and  counsellor  at  law. 

John  Conner,  Sheriff  of  the  county,  returned  into 
coart  the  following  named  grand  jurors  for  the  pres- 
ent term  of  court:  William  Helm  (whom  the  court 
appointed  Foreman),  Joseph  Minor,  Nicholas  Reagan, 
Allen  Crisler,  Oran  Stoddard,  Jacob  Case,  Sr. ,  Nich- 
olas Pumphrey.  Otheriel  Swim,  Anthony  Emily,  Paul 
Davis,  James  Webster,  John  Perrin,  James  Brown- 
lee,  Martin  McCray,  John  Wilson,  John  McCormick, 
James  Bolton  and  George  M.  Smith. 

The  Court  appointed  John  McCormick  as  Consta- 
ble to  attend  upon  the  grand  jury. 

John  Alexander  Dailey  was  admitted  by  the  court 
as  an  attorney  and  counsellor  at  law  on  his  produc- 
ing a  certificate  of  his  having  had  a  license  from  the 
Territorial  Government  of  Indiana  Territory,  and  to 
him  were  administered  the  several  oaths  required  by 
the  constitution  and  the  laws  of  Indiana. 

The  first  civil  case  tried  was  that  of     ,  vs- 

,  "In  an  action  of  trespass  on  the  case    for 

trover."  It  was  a  motion  to  discharge  defendant 
from  bail  on  the  ground  that  the  affidavit  was  bad. 
The  motion  was  sustained  and  he  discharged. 

There  were  nine  bills  returned  by  the  grand  jury. 


eight  of  which  were  for  assault  and  battery,  and  one 
for  an  affray — none  of  which,  it  seems,  were  tried  at 
the  first  term  of  court. 

The  first  jury  trial  was  that  of  a  case  of  debt.  The 
jury  was  composed  of  the  following  named:  Archi- 
bald Johnson,  Stephen  Sims,  Jehu  Perkins,  Giles 
Ford,  John  Rees,  James  W' hite,  Absalom  Burkham^ 
Robert  Royster,  John  Miller,  Robert  Alexander, 
Alexander  Hathaway  and  Samuel  Bell.  John  Rees 
was  Foreman. 

The  verdict  was  for  the  plaintiff.  "It  was  then 
considered  by  the  court  that  the  plaintiff  do  recover 
of  defendant  the  sum  of  $80,  the  amount  mentioned 
in  said  plaintiff's  declaration,  with  interest  thereon  at 
six  per  cent  per  annum  from  April  12,  1818,  until 
paid,  besides  the  costs  and  charges." 

For  the  first  term  of  the  Fayette  County  Circuit 
Court  William  W.  Wick  was  allowed  $20  for  his 
services  as  Prosecuting  Attorney. 

John  McCormick  was  allowed  $2  for  two  days' 
services  as  Constable  attending  the  grand  jury. 

Reason  Davis  and  John  McCormick  were  each 
allowed  $1  for  attending  and  waiting  on  the  court. 

At  this  term  of  the  court  there  were  more  than  a 
dozen  cases  on  the  docket,  nearly  all  of  which  were 
cases  for  debt,  and  the  greater  number  of  them  were 
disposed  of,  and  pretty  generally  in  favor  of  the 
plaintiffs. 

There  were  two  indictments  for  assault  and  bat- 
tery, both  of  which  were  disposed  of,  one  pleading 
guilty  and  was  fined  |1  and  to  pay  the  cost  of  prose- 
cution; and  in  the  other  case  the  court  ordered  "to 
quash  the  indictment." 

One  case  for  divorce  came  up  and  was  settled  in 
favor  of  the  plaintiff.  The  attorneys  in  this  case 
were  William  W.  Wick  for  the  petitioner,  and  Daniel 
J.  Caswell  (especially  appointed)  in  opposition. 

This  term  of  the  Fayette  Circuit  Court  was  held 
at  the  house  of  George  Reed,  located  on  what  is  now 
Central  Avenue,  west  side  and  second  door  south  of 
Fourth  Street.  The  sum  allowed  Mr.  Reed  for  the 
use  of  the  house  was  $12. 

The  Hon.  Oliver  H.    Smith,    in  his  "Early  Indi- 


64 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


.  ana, "  thus  speaks  of  his  recollections  of  the  early 
courts  of  the  Third  Judicial  Circuit,  of  which  the 
county  of  Fayette  comprised  a  part: 

"  The  Third  Judicial  Circuit  included  what  was 
then  (about  1820)  known  as  the  Whitewater  country, 
and  extended  from  the  county  of  Jefferson  north  to 
the  State  of  Michigan,  some  200  miles  in  length,  and 
from  the  Ohio  line  on  the  east,  to  White  Kiver,  some 
seventy-five  miles  west.  The  country  was  new, 
sparsely  settled,  and  being  on  the  western  frontier, 
the  towns  and  villages  were  filled  with  Indians  trad- 
ing their  peltries,  wild  game  and  moccasins  orna- 
mented with  the  quills  of  the  porcupine  with  the 
settlers,  for  calicoes,  whisky,  powder,  lead,  beads  and 
Buch  other  articles  as  met  their  fancy.  The  popula- 
tion of  the  country  embraced  by  the  circuit  was  a 
hardy,  fearless  and  generally  honest  but  more  or  less 
reckless  people,  such  as  are  usually  to  be  found  ad- 
vancing upon  the  frontiers  from  more  civilized  life, 
and  consequently  there  were  more  collisions  among 
them,  more  crimes  committed  calling  for  the  action 
of  the  Criminal  Courts,  than  is  common  in  older  set- 
tled and  more  civilized  parts  of  the  older  States. 

"  The  judiciary  system  at  the  time  referred  to  was 
like  the  country  in  its  infancy.  The  Circuit  Court 
was  composed  of  a  Presiding  Judge,  elected  by  the 
Legislature,  who  presided  in  all  the  courts  in  the 
circuit,  and  two  Associate  Judges,  elected  in  each 
county  l)y  the  people.  These  '  Side  Judges,'  as  they 
were  then  called,  made  no  pretensions  to  any  particu- 
lar knowledge  of  the  law,  but  still  they  had  the  power 
to  overrule  the  Presiding  Judge  and  give  the  opinion 
of  the  court,  and  sometimes  they  even  '  out-guessed  ' 
the  President,  giving  the  most  preposterous  reasons 
imaginable  for  their  decisions,  as  in  one  instance,  that 
a  writ  of  scire  facias  to  revive  a  judgment,  would  not 
lie  unless  it  was  sued  out  within  a  year  and  a  day. 
The  decision  of  the  Associates  was  affirmed  in  the 
Supreme  Court,  for  other  reasons,  of  course.  The 
com-t  houses  were  either  frame  or  log  buildings,  ar- 
ranged to  hold  the  court  in  one  end  and  the  grand 
jury  in  the  other,  the  petit  jury  being  accommodated 
in  some  neighboring  outbuildings.  The  Clerks  had 
very  little  qualification  for  their  duties;  still  they 
were  honest,  and  the  most  of  them  could  write  more 
legibly  than  Rufus  Choate,  United  States  Senator. 
The  Sheriffs  were  elected  by  the  people  as  they  are 
now,  and  seemed  to  have  been  selected  as  candidates 
on  account  of  their  fine  voices,  to  call  the  jurors  and 
witnesses  from  the  woods,  from  the  doors  of  the 
court  house,  and  their  ability  to  run  down  and  catch 
offenders.  The  most  important  personages  in  the 
country,  however,  were  the  young  lawyers,  univer- 
sally called  '  Squires '  by  old  and  young,  male  and 
female.     Queues  were  much  in  fashion,  and  nothing 


was  more  common  than  to  see  one  of  these  young 
'  Squires  '  with  a  wilted  rorum  hat,  that  had  once  been 
stiffened  with  glue  in  its  better  days,  upon  his  head, 
from  the  back  part  of  which  hung  a  queue  three  feet 
long,  tied  from  head  to  tip  with  an  eel  skin,  walking 
in  evident  superiority,  in  his  own  estimation,  among 
the  people  in  the  court  yard,  sounding  the  public 
mind  as  to  his  prospects  as  a  candidate  for  the  Legis- 
lature. There  were  no  caucuses  or  conventions  then. 
Every  candidate  brought  himself  out  and  ran  upon 
his  own  hook.  If  he  got  beat,  as  the  most  of  them 
did,  he  had  nobjdy  to  blame  but  himself  for  becom- 
ing a  candidate;  still,  he  generally  charged  it_  upon 
his  friends  for  not  voting  for  him,  and  the  next  sea- 
son found  him  once  more  upon  the  track,  sounding 
his  own  praises. 

"The  court  rooms  in  those  days  were  prepared 
and  furnished  with  much  simplicity,  and  yet  they 
seemed  to  answer  all  the  purposes  absolutely  neces- 
sary to  the  due  administration  of  justice.  The  build- 
ing generally  contained  two  rooms,  the  court  room 
being  the  larger,  at  one  end  of  which  there  was  a 
platform  elevated  some  three  feet  for  the  Judges,  with 
a  long  bench  to  seat  them.  These  benches  were 
very  substantial  in  general,  sufficient  to  sustain  the 
most  weighty  Judges,  yet  on  one  occasion  the  bench 
gave  way,  and  down  came  three  fat,  aldermanly 
Judges  on  the  floor.  One  of  them,  quite  a  wag,  see- 
ing the  '  Squires  '  laughing,  remarked,  '  Gentlemen, 
this  is  a  mighty  weak  bench.'  The  bar  had  their 
benches  near  the  table  of  the  Clerk,  and  the  crowd 
was  kept  back  by  a  long  pole  fastened  with  withes  at 
the  ends.  The  crowds  at  that  day  thought  the  hold- 
ing of  a  court  a  great  affair;  the  people  came  hun- 
dreds of  miles  to  see  the  Judges  and  hear  the  lawyers 
'plead,'  as  they  called  it.  On  one  occasion  there 
came  on  to  be  tried  before  the  jury  an  indictment  for 
an  assault  and  battery  against  a  man  for  pulling  the 
nose  of  another  who  had  insulted  him.  The  court 
room  was  filled  to  suffocation;  the  two  Associate 
Judges  were  on  the  bench;  the  evidence  had  been 
heard  and  public  expectation  was  on  tiptoe.  All  was 
silent  as  death,  when  the  young  '  Squire,'  afterward 
Judge  Charles  H.  Test,  arose  and  addressed  the 
court:  '  If  the  court  please — .'  He  was  here  inter- 
rupted by  Judge  Mitchell  from  the  bench,  '  Yes,  we 
do  please.  Go  to  the  bottom  of  the  case,  young  man, 
the  people  have  come  in  to  hear  the  lavryers  plead.' 
The  young  Squire,  encouraged  by  the  kind  response 
of  the  Judge,  proceeded  to  address  the  jury  some 
three  hours,  in  excited  eloquence,  upon  the  great 
provocation  his  client  had  received  to  induce  his 
docile  nature  to  bound  over  all  legal  barriers  and  take 
the  prosecutor  by  the  nose.  All  eyes  were  upon  him, 
and  as  he  closed.  Judge  Winchall  roared  out,   '  Cap-

ital!  I  did  not  think  it  was  in  him!'  The  jury 
returned  a  verdict  of  'not  guilty,'  amid  the  raptur- 
ous applause  of  the  audience.  Court  adjourned, 
and  the  people  returned  home  to  tell  their  children 
that  they  had  heard  the  lawyers  'plead.'  " 

THE  BBADBUKN    TRIAL.* 

Among  the  lirst  of  the  great  tragic  trials  in  the 
State  of  Indiana  was  that  of  Dr.  John  Bradburn,   of 
this    county,    on  an    indictment  for  murder,    at  the 
time  Oliver  H.  Smith  was  County  Prosecutor  for  the 
State.     The  facts  of  the  case  were  briefly  these:  "  Dr. 
Bradburn    was  an   eminent  surgeon,  a  man  of  great 
muscular    power,   and  of  the  most  indomitable  per- 
sonal  courage.     I    have   scarcely    ever    seen  a  more 
athletic  man,  and   I   never    knew    a   man  of  greater 
bravery.      He  lived  some  four  or  five  miles  from  Con- 
nersville.     In   general    the    Doctor    was    highly    re- 
spected, but  it  seems  that  he  had  giveQ  some  real  or 
imaginary  cause  of  offense  to  several  young  men  of 
equal  respectability  in  his  neighborhood,  who  took  it 
into  their  heads  that  they  would  take  the  Doctor  from 
his  house  in   the   night,  ride  him  on  a  rail  to   the 
water   and    then    duck    him.     The    Doctor    by    some 
means  got  wind  of  what  was  going  on,  and  prepared 
lumself  with  weapons  for  defense,  among  which  was 
a  long  dissecting  knife  with  two  edges.      The  young 
men,  unaware  of  his  prejjaration,  fixed  upon  a  dark 
night  to   carry    their   pilans    into   execution.     Capt. 
Robert  L.   Broaddus  was  selected    as   their  leader. 
About    12    o'clock    at    night    the    party    silently  ap- 
proached the  dwelling  of  the  Doctor  and  tried  to  open 
the  door,  but  found  it  fast.      The  Doctor  was  in  bed 
in  an  adjoining  room,    wide-awake,    with   his  large 
knife  under  his  pillow,  cool  and  prepared.      The  out- 
side party  placed   an  iron  crow-bar,  which  they  had 
brought  with  them,   under  the   door,  threw  it  off  its 
hinges  and  entered  the  room,  carrying  with  them  the 
ropes  prepared  to  tie  the  Doctor  before  they  took  him 
from  the  house.      In  the  meantime    the    Doctor  re- 
mained silently  sitting  upon  his  bed,  with  his  knife 
in  his  hands.      The  room  was  dark.      The   party  ad- 
vanced, feeling  their  way,  until  the  foremost,   young 
Alexander,  about  eighteen  yeafs  of  age,  reached  the 
bed,  when  he  received   a  fatal  stab   with  the  knife, 
turned,  rushed  to  the  door,  stepped  out,  and  fell  dead 
in  the  yard.     Not  a  word   was   spoken.     The  next, 
young   Caldwell,    about    twenty   years    of   age,    ad 
vanced,  evidently  not  knowing  the  fate  of  Alexander, 
until  he  came  within  the  grasp  of  the  Doctor,   when 
the  fatal  knife  was  thrust  through  bis  side,  penetrat- 
ing his  heart.      He  uttered  a  loud  groan,  turned,  fled 
to  the  door,  passed  a  short  distance  into  the  yard,  fell 
and  died  near  the  body   of  Alexander.       The  groan 

•From  Hon.  0.  H.  Smith's  "Early  Indiana."  I 


of  Galdwel)  alarmed  the  others,  who  immediately  re- 
treated for  the  door,  pursued  by  the  Doctor,  and  one 
other  of  the  party  received  a  severe  but  not  a  mortal 
wound.  Capt.  Broaddus  told  me  that  at  one  time  the 
Doctor  was  between  him  and  the  door,  and  as  he 
passed  to  go  out  the  Doctor  struck  at  him  with  his 
knife,  and  just  grazed  his  side.  It  was  very  evident 
that  but  for  the  groan  of  Caldwell  not  one  of  the 
assailants  would  have  left  the  house  alive.  Such 
was  the  awful  tragedy  at  the  house. 

"The  young  men  killed  were  of  the  very  first  fam- 
ilies of  the  county;  indeed  of  the  State.  The  excite 
ment  was  intense;  the  Doctor  gave  himself  up,  and 
was  put  in  jail.  While  the  inquest  was  sitting  over 
the  dead  bodies  he  was  calm  and  composed,  and  stated 
all  about  the  transaction,  and  I  have  no  doubt  truth- 
fully, for  he  was  a  man  of  truth,  although  his  life 
was  at  stake.  He  had  been  my  client,  and  on  this, 
the  most  trying  occasion  of  his  life,  he  insisted  that 
I  should  defend  him.  I  told  him  I  was  the  Attorney 
of  the  State.  '  You  get  but  $120,  a  year,  and  I  wil' 
give  you  $500  for  this  case  alone.'  I,  however,  at 
once  told  him  that  no  fee  could  induce  me  to  forsake 
the  State  at  such  a  juncture,  and  declined  further 
conversation  with  him.  He  sent  to  Brookville  for 
John  T.  McKinney  to  defend  him.  The  court  met; 
the  grand  jury  found  a  bill  for  murder;  the  trial 
came  on;  the  facts  substantially  as  stated  were  proved, 
with  the  admission  of  the  Doctor.  The  court  house 
was  crowded  with  an  excited  population;  Gen. 
McKinney  made  a  strong  speech  in  the  defense,  bu^ 
it  evidently  fell  upon  unwilling  ears.  My  closing 
speech  was  again  and  again  applauded  by  the  crowdt 
and  the  applause  as  often  reprimanded  bj'  the  court 
and  the  Sheriff.  It  was  evident  that  the  jury  and 
the  audience  were  with  me,  and  had  the  case  gone  to 
the  jury  without  any  charge  from  the  court.  Doctor 
Bradburn  would  have  been  illegally  convicted,  I  have 
no  doubt.  But  Judge  Eggleston,  as  we  say,  had  the 
'closing,'  a  last  speech,  and  nobly  did  he  sustain 
his  high  character  as  a  Judge  on  that  occasion.  He 
took  up  the  case  calmly,  but  firmly;  examined  its 
principles,  and  laid  down  the  law  of  self-defense,  or 
excusable  homicide,  that  governed  the  prosecution, 
step  by  step,  until,  I  am  satisfied,  there  was  neither 
lawyer,  juror,  nor  bystander  in  the  court  room  that 
did  not  acquit  the  prisoner  before  the  jury  left  the 
box.  The  jury  retired  but  a  few  minutes  and  re- 
turned a  verdict  of  not  guilty,  on  the  ground  of  self- 
defense.  So  ended  this  long-tobe  remembered  case 
in  old  Fayette." 

[We  had  desired  and  hoped  to  be  able  to  give  an 
account  of  the  awful  tragedy  pictured  above  as  it  ap- 
peared, written  at  the  time  of  its  occurrence,  in  the 
neighboring  press.    Though  diligent  search  has  been

made  for  files  of  papers  that  might  contain  it,  they 
have  not  been  found.  The  tragedy  took  place  on 
what  was  known  as  the  Isgrig  farm,  located  on  Lick 
Creek  about  mid-way  between  Connersville  and  Har- 
risburg,  on  the  night  of  May  27,  1825,  — the  night  of 
the  day  on  which  was  a  general  muiiter  at  Harrisburg. 
The  names  of  the  young  men  killed  were  Nesbit  Alex- 
ander, and  James  Caldwell,  each  being  in  the  twenty- 
fifth  year  of  his  age.  We  learn  from  Uncle  Joseph 
Caldwell,  a  brother  of  James,  that  Mr.  Smith  is  mis- 
taken in  regard  to  the  circumstances  of  Caldwell's 
death.  Young  Caldwell  received  a  stab  just  below 
the  right  nipple,  when  he  rushed  through  the  house, 
hallooing  as  he  went,  "Knife,  boys!"  which  alarmed 
the  others,  causing  them  to  retreat.  He  ran  some 
fifty  or  one  hundred  yards  to  a  fence  near  by,  and 
from  there  was  taken  by  the  other  boys  to  the  house 
of  Samuel  Dehaven,  where  he  remained  several  days, 
then  was  removed  to  the  home  of  his  parents,  where 
Joseph  Caldwell  now  resides,  where  he  died  June  3, 
1825.  William  Caldwell,  a  cousin  of  James,  was 
another  of  the  party  who  received  a  wound  from  the 
knife.  With  this  exception  the  circumstances  of  the 
tragedy  as  given  by  Mr.  Smith  are  believed  to  be 
about  correct.  The  Whiter.  ] 

PROBATE    CODRT. 

Until  the  year  1829,  the  business  of  the  Probate 
Court  was  transacted  before  tlie  Associate  Judges  of 
the  county.  The-  first  session  of  this  court  was  held 
at  Connersville  before  Train  Caldwell  and  Edward 
Webb,  Associate  Judges  of  Fayette  County,  begin- 
ning on  the  26th  day  of  April,  1819;  present  also 
were  Jonathan  McCarty  and  John  Conner,  Clerk  of 
the  Courts  and  Sheriff  of  the  county,  respectively. 
The  first  business  was  transacted  on  the  following 
day,  when  appeared  William  and  Morgan  Vardiman, 
administrators  of  all  goods,  chattels,  and  credits  of 
John  S.  Vardiman,  deceased,  and  produced  and  ex- 
hibited an  inventory  of  the  appraisements  of  the 
goods,  chattels,  and  the  estate  of  said  John  S.  Vardi. 
man,  deceased,  as  appraised  by  William  Callon  and 
Abraham  Bays,  which  was  ordered  filed  in  the  ofiice 
of  the  Clerk  of  the  Circuit  Court;  and  the  inventory 
of  the  sale  of  said  decedent's  estate,  which  was  ex- 
hibited by  the  administrators  as  sold  by  them  on  the 
26th  of  February,  1819,  was  by  the  court  ordered 
recorded  and  the  original  filed  in  the  Clerk's 
office. 

The  business  of  this  court  was  first  transacted 
before  a  Probate  Judge  in  September,  1829,  when 
Philip  Mason  appeared  as  such  officer  (producing  his 
commission  September  7).  Mr.  Mason  was  succeeded 
by  Justice  Wright,  whose  name  is  first  mentioned  in 
this  connection  at  the  August  term  of  court,  1834, and 


who  served  until  the  office  was  abolished  by  the  con- 
stitution of  1850. 

COURT    OF    COMMON    PLEAS. 

Under  the  constitution  of  1850,  the  business  of 
the  Probate  Court  was  classified  with  that  of  the  Court 
of  Common  Pleas,  which  court  was  formed  by  the  new 
constitution  of  1850,  the  first  term  of  which  court 
was  convened  at  Connersville  in  January,  1853,  with 
John  S.  Reid  on  the  bench,  as  the  first  Judge  of  the 
Court  of  Common  Pleas.  Mr.  Reid  discharged  the 
duties  of  this  office  until  the  December  term  of  the 
court,  1860,  when  he  was  succeeded  by  Jeremiah  M. 
Wilson,  who  served  until  the  spring  term  of  court, 
1865,  then  succeeded  by  John  F.  Kibby.  Mr.  Kibby 
served  until  1873,  when  the  business  of  this  court  and 
that  of  the  Probate  Court  were  thrown  into  the  Cir- 
cuit Court.

JUSTICES    OF    THE    PEACE. 

A  complete  record  of  the  persons  who  have  served 
as  Justices  of  the  Peace  in  Fayette  County  seems  not 
to  have  been  kept,  yet  several  fragmentary  records 
are  found  in  the  court  house,  from  which,  together 
with  such  names  as  appear  on  record,  as  serving  in 
that  capacity,  through  the  various  records  of  the 
county,  the  greater  number  of  Justices  of  the  county 
from  its  organization  can  be  given,  and  are  set  forth 
in  the  following  list.  Where  it  can  be  shown,  the 
date  of  commission,  or  the  date  each  was  qualified,

of  Fayette  be  divided  into  five  townships,  namely: 
Columbia,  Connersville,  Harrison,  Brownsville  and 
Jennings.  Their  boundaries  were  given,  which  will

The  first  marriage  license  recorded  after  the  organ- 
ization of  the  county,  was  that  of  Stephen  Philpott 
to  Rebecca  Hawkins.  The  date  of  the  issue  of  the 
license  was  February  9,  1819.  The  marriage  was 
solemnized  by  Rev.  Adam  Banks. 

The  first  deed  recorded  in  the  county  was  an 
indenture  made  January  31,  1819,  by  Paul  Davis, 
and  his  wife  Margaret,  of  Connersville  Township, 
Franklin  County,  Ind.,  on  the  one  part,'and  James 
Davis,  of  the  same  township,  county  and  State 
on  the  other  part.  It  was  the  conveyance  of  the 
south  half  of  the  northeast  quarter  of  Section  21, 
Township  14,  Range  12  east,  and  the  consideration 
was  $80.  The  transaction  was  acknowledged  before 
John  Perin,  a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  January  31,  1818, 
and  recorded  March  23,  1819,  by  J.  C.  Reed. 

The  first  will  recorded  was  that  of  the  last  will 
and  testament  of  George  Kirschman,  deceased,  of 
which  record  was  made  in  the  court  house,  August 
26,  1819. 

The  Clerks  of  the  courts  of  the  county  from  its 
organization  to  1841  were  also  the  Clerks  of  the 
Board  of  Commissioners.  In  1841  the  office  of 
Auditor  was  created,  and  since  that  time  the  Auditor 
of  the  county  is  also  the  Clerk  to  the  Commissioners.

CHAPTER  VIII. 


INTERNAL    IMPROVEMENTS. 

ROADS— MAIL     AND    STAGE    ROUTES— WHITEWATER    VALLEY     CANAL— HYDRAULIC    COMPANY— TURNPIKES    AND 
BRIDGES— RAILROADS. 


ONE  of  the  gi-eat  inconveniences  attending  the 
settlement  of  a  new  country  is  the  utter  destitu- 
tion of  improvements.  The  pioneer  as  he  journeys 
onward  into  the  wilderness  over  hills,  through  track- 
less and  tangled  thickets,  crossing  bridgless  streams 
and  through  swamps,  at  the  very  outset  is  impressed 
with  the  idea  that  a  road  would  be  most  desi- 
rable. 

The  first  roads  in  Fayette  County  were  mere  trails 
or  paths  for  horses  made  by  the  Indians  while  en  route 
to  and  from  their  favorite  hunting  grounds  and 
camps,  or  to  the  trading-posts  established  at  points 
along  the  beautiful  Whitewater,  whence  they  went  to 
barter  their  pelts  and  furs. 

One  of  these  early  paths  was  the  "  Indian  Trace  " 
leading  from  Connersville,  or  the  trading-post  of 
John  Conner,  to  the  northwest  to  an  Indian  village 
located  in  the  center  of  the  Thorutown  Reservation, 
in  what_is  now  Boone  County,  this  State. 

One  of  the  earliest  provisions  of  the  laws  enacted 
for  the  government  of  the  Northwest  Territory  was 
that  which  provided  a  "road  fund."  Various  roads 
through  the  county  were  early  proposed  and  some  of 
them  constructed,  but  these  for  years  were  little  more 
than  tracks  through  the  woods  cleared  of  timber,  with 
no  bridges,  and  in  the  rich  and  fresh  condition  of  the 
soil  became  next  to  impassable  in  the  wet  seasons. 
As  early  as  1820  Commissioners  were  appointed  to 
lay  out  "  State  roads."  One  materially  affecting 
Fayette  County  was  from  Lawrencoburg  through 
Brookville  by  way  of  Southgate  and  Tanner's  Creek, 
Connersville,  Waterloo  and  Centreville  to  Winchester. 
Over  a  half  century  ago  it  was  familiarly  called  the 
Connersville  State  road,  and  from  Brookville  it  was  a 
continuation  of    Main  Street,  up  the  hill  northward 


through    Green    Brier    (Blooming  Grove)  and  West 
Union  (Everton)  to  Connersville. 

"In  1819  or  1820  another  road  was  made  from 
the  Whitewater  Valley,  near  Connersville,  passing 
through  Rush  County,  and  crossing  Big  Flat  Rock 
not  far  from  where  Smelser's  mills  were  afterward 
built;  then  crossing  Blue  River  above  Morristown; 
thence  to  the  site  of  Indianapolis.  I  am  under  the 
impression  that  this  road  was  made  by  George  Pogue 
and  John  McCormack,  as  it  has  always  been  under- 
stood that  these  two  gentlemen  were  the  first  persons 
who,  with  their  families,  moved  from  the  Whitewater 
Valley,  and  settled  in  the  neighborhood  of  where 
Indianapolis  now  stands." — i[Elijah  Hackleman.^ 

MAIL    AND   STAGE    ROUTES. 

Connersville,  Everton,  Harrisburg,  Waterloo  and 
Plumb  Orchard  constituted  the  postoffices  of  the 
county  in  1830. 

In  the  spring  of  1833,  long  before  the  county  had 
advanced  to  the  era  of  gravel  or  macadamized  high- 
ways, the  notes  of  the  bugle  horn  could  be  heard  an- 
nouncing the  arrival  of  the  stage  coach  from  Cincin- 
nati, which  if  not  detained  by  a  "  stick  in  the  mud  " 
was  on  time.  The  mail  lines  of  stages  of  which  we 
write  were  at  this  period  owned  and  managed  by 
Abner  McCarty,  of  Brookville,  who  informed  the 
public  by  a  notice  in  a  paper  of  that  village  that  "the 
stages  will  leave  William  Henries,  near  City  Hall,  in 
Cincinnati,  every  Wednesday,  Friday  and  Sunday  for 
Brookvilje;  leave  Brookville  every  Tuesday,  Thursday 
and  Saturday  for  Cincinnati;  leave,  Centreville  every 
Wednesday,  Friday  and  Sunday  for  Brookville;  every 
Saturday  for  Richmond;  leave  Richmond  every  Sun- 
day for  Brookville.

HIvSTORY   OF   PAYETTE    COUNTY. 


"To  and  from  these  points  was  uia  Harrison,  Tren- 
ton, Brookville,  Connersville  and  Milton  to  Centre- 
ville.  From  Brookville  via  Fairfield,  Dunlaps- 
ville,  Liberty,  Brownsville  and  Abington  to  Rich- 
mond." 

The  entrance  of  the  route  from  Cincinnati  into 
the  village  of  Connersville,  as  given  by  a  pioneer, 
was  "over  by  Swifts'  and  Orr's,  where  it  left  the  main 
road  and  passed  by  old  Uncle  Sol  Claypool's,  then 
across  the  strip  of  woods  in  the  river  bottom  to  the 
ford  opposite  where  Root's  foundry  now  stands." 

WHITEWATER    VALLEY    CANAL. 

One  of  the  early  demands  of  the  people  of  a  new 
country  is  for  means  of  intercommunication.  So 
soon  as  the  western  country  began  to  be  settled  there 
began  the  cry  for  national  aid  in  opening  up  all  sorts 
of  avenues  for  ingfress  and  egress  to  and  from  the 
frontier  lands.  New  York,  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio 
had  given  great  attention  to  the  subject  of  canals, 
and  Indiana  early  in  its  history  turned  its  attention 
to  the  same  subject. 

The  project  of  a  canal  through  the  Whitewater 
Valley  was  agitated  as  early  as  1822  or  1823,  by 
Alvin  Joselyn,  then  connected  with  the  Brookville 
press;  subsequently  there  was  held  at  Harrison, 
Ohio,  a  convention  of  delegates  from  Franklin 
Wayne,  Union,  Randolph,  Fayette  and  Dearborn 
counties.  A  survey  was  soon  made  under  the  super- 
vision of  Col.  Shriver's  Brigade  of  United  States 
Engineers.  Col.  Shriver  died  before  the  survey  was 
completed,  and  after  his  death  the  work  was  continued 
by  Col.  Stansbury,  who  began  at  the  mouth  of  Gar- 
rison's Creek,  but  discontinned  his  labor  on  the 
approach  of  winter. 

Nothing  further  seems  to  have  been  done  until  in 
1834,  when  from  the  Connersville  Watchman  it 
appears  that  "  a  corps  of  engineers  are  surveying  the 
route  of  the  contemplated  canal  down  the  valley  of 
the  Whitewater." 

In  January,  1836,  was  passed  by  the  General 
Assembly  of  Indiana  the  celebrated  act  to  provide 
for  a  general  system  of  internal  improvements  under 
which  were  commenced  the  Wabash  and  Erie  Canal, 
the  Madison  &amp;  Indianapolis  Railroad,  Indiana  Cen- 
tral Canal  and  the  Whitewater  Valley  Canal.  The 
last  named  work  was  to  extend  from  Hagerstown  to 
Lawrenceburg.  (The  State  of  Ohio,  or  a  company 
chartered  by  the  State,  afterward  constructed  a 
branch  from  Harrison,  Ohio,  to  Cincinnati.) 

The  passage  of  this  bill  was  celebrated  at  Con- 
nersville by  an  old-timo  jollification  on  the  evening 
of  the  18th  of  January,  which,  however,  ended  in  a 
very  appalling  accident  by  which  one  young  man  lost 
his  life  and  three  others  were  maimed.      An  account 


of  the    demonstrations  and  of  the  accident  will   be 
found  in  the  sketch  of  Connersville. 

The  survey  and  location  of  the  Whitewater  Valley 
Canal  were  completed  and  the  contracts  for  building 
the  various  sections  were  let  at  Brookville,  Septem- 
ber 13,  1836,  which  event  was  there  the  occasion  of 
a  celebration,  and  that  day  made  a  general  gala  day. 
The  orator  on  the  occasion  was  Hon.  David  Wallace. 
Gov.  Noble,  ex-Gov.  James  B.  Ray,  Dr.  Drake,  of 
Cincinnati,  and  George  H.  Dunn,  Esq.,  of  Lawrence- 
burg, were  chosen  as  representative  characters  to  per- 
form the  ceremony  of  "breaking ground  "  for  the  new 
canal. 

Under  the  auspices  of  the  State,  the  canal  was 
completed  from  the  Ohio  River  to  Brookville,  as  well 
as  aboat  half  the  work  from  Brookville  to  Cambridge 
City.  The  cost  of  the  work  to  Brookville  was  $664,- 
665.  At  this  time  (1839)  the  State  found  itself  in 
debt  some  $14,000,000,  and  was  compelled  to  abandon 
all  public  works. 

The  first  boat  to  reach  Brookville  was  the  "  Ben 
Franklin."  This  was  on  Saturday,  June  8,  1839. 
The  citizens  gave  vent  to  their  joy  by  the  firing  of 
cannon  and  other  demonstrations. 

At  the  session  of  1841-42,  the  Legislature  char- 
tered the  Whitewater  Valley  Company,  with  a  capital 
stock  of  $400,000.  Samuel  W.  Parker,  of  Conners- 
ville, afterward  member  of  Congress  from  this  dis 
trict,  took  an  active  part  in  getting  up  the  company, 
and,  in  connection  with  J.  G.  Marshall  and  others, 
secm'ed  the  granting  of  the  charter  by  the  Legisla- 
ture, of  which  they  were  both  active  members.  One 
of  the  principal  contractors  under  the  State  and  com- 
pany was  Thomas  Tyner. 

The  citizens  of  Cambridge  City  celebrated  the 
commencement  of  operations  by  the  company,  on  the 
28th  of  July,  1842,  b}'  a  barbecue,  which  was  attend- 
ed by  about  10,000  persons.  The  first  wheel-bar- 
row load  of  earth  was  dug  and  wheeled  out  by  Hon. 
Samuel  W.  Parker;  the  second,  by  Hon.  Jehu  T. 
Elliott,  of  New  Castle,  since  a  Judge  of  the  Supreme 
Court.  Every  one  preseot  will  remember  the  witty 
little  speech  of  Parker  on  first  "breaking  ground"  in 
the  name  of  the  company,  and  the  able-and  more  for- 
mal address  which  he  afterward  commenced,  but 
which  a  terrible  thunder-storm  prevented  him  from 
completing.  Letters  from  Henry  Clay  and  other  dis- 
tinguished persons  who  had  been  invited,  but  failed 
to  attend,  were  read  on  the  occasion. 

In  October,  1843,  the  canal  was  extended  from 
Brookville  fifteen  miles  to  Laurel;  to  Connersville, 
twelve  miles  further,  in  Juno,  1845;  and  in  October, 
the  same  year,  it  was  completed  to  Cambridge  City, 
the  entire  cost  to  the  company  being  $473,000. 

The  first  boat  that  arrived  at  Connersville  was  in 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

the  fall  of  1845.  It  was  called  the  "Patriot,"  and 
was  commanded  by  Capt.  Gayle  Ford. 

On  the  first  day  of  January,  1847,  a  tremendous 
freshet  damaged  the  canal  so  badly  that  it  cost 
upward  of  $100,000  to  repair  it;  by  the  flood  was  car- 
ried off  the  aqueduct  across  Symon's  Greek,  near 
Cambridge,  and  that  across  the  West  Fork  of  White- 
water, at  Laurel,  besides  washing  immense  channels 
around  the  feeder  dams  at  Cambridge,  Connersville, 
Laurel,  Brookville,  the  one  four  miles  below,  and 
that  at  Harrison,  and  also  did  much  damage  along 
the  whole  line.  A  second  flood  in  November,  1848, 
only  a  few  weeks  after  the  repairs  had  been  com- 
pleted, damaged  it  to  the  amount  of  $80,000.  It 
was,  however,  again  repaired  and  operated,  to  some 
extent,  for  several  years,  until  superseded  by  rail- 
roads, one  the  Whitewater  Valley  Railroad,  con- 
structed along  the  tow-path,  and  part  of  the  way  in 
the  bed  of  the  canal,  which  had  been  previously 
placed  in  the  hands  of  a  receiver,  and  the  right-of- 
way  transferred  to  the  railroad  company  for  that  pur- 
pose. 

The  canal  constructed  by  the  company  extended 
north  only  to  Cambridge  City.  (The  length  of  the 
canal  from  Lawrenceburg  to  Cambridge  City  was 
seventy  miles.)  Subsequently,  in  or  about  the  year 
1846,  the  Hagerstown  Canal  Company  was  organized 
and  the  canal  completed  to  that  place  in  1847.  But 
a  small  number  of  boats,  however,  ever  reached  that 
place,  and  the  canal  soon  fell  into  disuse,  except  as 
a  source  of  water-power, 

HYDRAULIC  COMPANY. 

The  Whitewater  Valley  Canal  Company  trans- 
ferred its  hydraulic  interest  to  the  Connersville 
Hydraulic  Company,  which  was  organized  in  Decem- 
ber, 1865,  with  a  capital  stock  of  $10,000,  under  the 
following  officers:  President,  P.  H.  Roots;  Treas- 
urer, F.  M.  Roots;  Secretary,  Samuel  Enyart;  Board 
of  Directors,  P.  H.  and  F.  M.  Roots,  and  Matthew 
Pfafflin.  The  Hydraulic  Company  secured  a  lease 
from  the  Canal  Company  in  February,  1866,  which 
was^  approved  by  the  receiver  and  the  United  States 
Circuit  Court  of  the  Southern  District  of  Indiana. 
The  company  control  the  Hydraulic  from  Cambridge 
City,  including  the  feeder  dam  at  that  point,  and  the 
one  at  Loekport;  also  to  Heron's  lock,  about  one  mile 
below  Connersville.  It  is  officered  at  this  time  (1884) 
by  F.  M.  Roots,  President;  F.  T.  Roots,  Superin- 
tendent and  Treasurer;  E.  Woodward,  Secretary;  F. 
M.,  F.  T.  and  D.  T.  Roots,  Directors.  It  has  been 
under  the  same  manaorement  from  the  beginnino'. 

TURNPIKES    AND    BRIDGES. 

Gravel  roads  and  macadamized  highways  may  be 
said  not  to  have  progressed  in   the  county    until   the 


decade  between  1850-60.  A  number  of  such  roads 
were  projected  in  and  through  the  county  soon  after 
the  passage  of  the  bill  relating  to  such  highways, 
approved  May  1,  1852. 

Ai'ticles  of  association  under  the  name  of  the 
Milton  &amp;  Rushville  Turnpike  Company  were  tiled 
in  the  spring  of  1854,  with  the  object  in  view  of 
constructing  a  gravel  road  from  "  Milton  in  Wayne 
County,  in  the  direction  of  Rushville,  in  Rush  Coun- 
ty, to  the  eastern  boundary  line  of  said  county,  via 
Bentonville  in  Fayette  County,"  but  it  is  the  under- 
standing that  this  road  was  not  then  constructed. 

Articles  of  association  were  next  filed  by  the  Con- 
nersville &amp;  Rushville  Gravel  Road  Company,  for 
the  purpose  of  constructing  a  road  "  from  a  point 
on  the  Connersville  and  Rushville  State  road,  a  half 
mile  west  from  the  corporation  limits  of  Connersville, 
thence  west  on  and  near  the  line  of  said  State  road, 
to  where  the  same  intersects  the  county  line  dividing 
Rush  and  Fayette  Counties  at  Vienna;  distance  about 
eight  miles."     This  road  was  constructed. 

At  about  this  time  several  roads  were  projected 
and  constructed,  and  in  1856,  as  shown  by  a  map  of 
the  county,  the  following  gravel  or  macadamized 
roads  were  in  process  of  construction,  or  completed, 
the  distance  in  the  county  being  given: 

Connersville  and  Milton,  five  miles. 

Milton  and  Brownsville,  five  miles. 

Connersville  and  Brookville,  nine  miles. 

Bentonville  and  Dublin,  four  miles. 

Bentonville  and  Milton,  two  miles. 

Besides  the  above  there  are  other  turnpikes  in 
the  county,  as  set  forth  below: 

The  county  line  (Fayetteville  and  Fairfield),  seven 
miles. 

Connersville  and  Ahjuina,  five  miles. 

Connersville  and  Brownsville,  six  miles. 

Connersville  and  Waterloo  Township,  four  and 
one-half  miles. 

Connersville  and  Fairview,  eleven  miles. 

Connersville   and  Harrisburg,  eight  miles. 

Harrisburg  and  Bentonville,  seven  miles. 

Connersville  and  Rushville  (to  Vienna),  nine 
miles.  (This  latter  has  beeu  suffered  to  go  down, 
and  is  not  now  kept  up  as  a  pike). 

There  was  once  a  turnpike  known  as  the  Fayette- 
ville and  Laurel  pike,  five  miles  in  length,  but  it, 
too,  has  gone  down. 

These  highways  have  been  partly  constructed  by 
taxation,  but  largely  by  subscription. 

The  toll  gate,  that  relic  of  barbarism,  can  be  seen 
along  at  least  seven  of  these  roads. 

The  first  bridge  of  auy  particular  size  in  this 
county  was  built  over  Whitewater  River,  on  the  road 
leading  from  Connersville  to  East  Connersville.    The 


76 


HISTORY    OP   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


contractors  were  Minor  Meeker,  H.  B.  Woodcock  and 
James  Veatch.  It  was  built  between  the  year  1838 
and  1842.  The  contract  for  a  now  wrought  iron 
bridge  over  Waterloo  ford  was  awarded  to  the  Canton, 
Ohio,  Wrought  Iron  Bridge  Company,  in  June,  1881, 
for  110,637.37.  This  company  had  constructed,  two 
yearri  prior,  the  bridge  at  Nulltown.  The  new  bridge 
at  Waterloo  was  viewed  and  accepted  by  the  Commis- 
sioners in  March,  1884.  Cost  $4,555.  The  greater 
number  of  the  larger  bridges  of  the  county  have  been 
built  within  the  last  decade. 

RAILROADS. 

The  Cincinnati,  Hamilton  &lt;&amp;  Indianapolis  Rail- 
road was  constructed  by  the  Junction  Railroad  Com- 
pany, which  was  incorporated  by  the  State  of  Indiana, 
February  15, 1848,  tor  the  purpose  of  constructing  a 
railroad  from  Rushville,  Ind.,  by  the  way  of  Conners- 
ville  and  Osford,  to  coQuaat  with  the  Cincinnati, 
Hamilton  &amp;  Dayton  Railroad  at  Hamilton,  Ohio.  The 
Legislature  of  Ohio,  on  the  8th  of  March,  1849, 
granted  to  this  company  the  right  to  extend  its  road 
from  the  State  line  to  Hamilton,  and  gave  to  it  all  the 
rights,  privileges  and  powers  granted  to  railroad  com- 
panies by  the  general  law  of  Ohio,  passed  in  Febru- 
ary, 1848.  The  company  was  organized  in  1849,  and 
surveys  were  made  preparatory  to  the  location  of  the 
road  from  Rushville  to  Hamilton;  but  a  diiference  of 
opinion  arose  as  to  the  best  route,  which  'produced  a 
temporary  suspension  of  operations  on  the  road 
Early  in  1852  the  company  was  re-organized,  and 
new  officers  elected,  who  adopted  measures  to  make 
the  location  of  the  road  upon  the  route  originally 
designated  in  the  charter.  The  construction  of  the 
road  was  commenced  in  1852,  and  was  continued  with 
moderate  progress,  at  intervals,  until  1864,  when  it 
was  completed  to  Connersville. 

In  1853  the  officers  of  the  company  were  as  fol- 
lows: President,  John  Woods;  Directors,  J.  D. 
Jones,  of  Cincinnati;  J.  M.  Ridenour,  of  College 
Corner;  S.  W.Parker,  of  Connersville;  W.  M.  Smith, 
of  Connersville;  John  Woods,  of  Hamilton;  George 
Hibben,  of  Rushville;  J.  Blake,  of  Indianapolis; 
Treasurer,  William  Tindall,  of  Connersville;  Secre- 
tary, J.  Leach,  of  Connersville;  Chief  Engineer,  A. 
H.  Campbell,  of  Liberty.  Mr.  Campbell  served  as 
Chief  Engineer  of  the  road  continuously  up  to  1871. 

In  February,  1853,  the  Ohio  &amp;  Indianapolis 
Railroad  Company  was  incorporated  for  the  purpose 
of  constructing  a  railroad  from  Rushville  to  Indian- 
apolis. This  company  was  organized  by  the  friends 
and  stock-holders  of  the  Junction  Railroad,  for  the 
purpose  of  obtaining  a  direct  communication  upon  a 
continuous  railroad  of  the  same  gauge  between 
Indianapolis    and    Cincinnati.      This    company    in 


April,  1858,  was  consolidated  with  and  merged  into 
the  Junction  Railroad  Company.  By  this  means  the 
Junction  Railroad  was  extended  from  Indianapolis  to 
Hamilton,  ninety-eight  miles,  where  it  connects  with 
the  Cincinnati,  Hamilton  &amp;  Dayton  Railroad. 

In  1806  an  effort  was  made  to  complete  the  con- 
struction from  Connersville  to  Rushville,  and  the 
following  winter  and  spring  the  company  became 
financially  embarrassed,  and  the  work  was  suspended. 

In  April,  1867,  a  party  of  some  twelve  individuals 
of  means  purchased  a  controlling  interest  in  the 
stock,  and  assumed  the  purchase  of  the  unsold  first 
mortgage  bonds  of  the  company,  and  commenced 
work  to  complete  the  road  and  equip  with  rolling 
stock  the  entire  line  to  Indianapolis.  This  was 
effected  so  far  that  trains  ran  over  the  whole  road 
from  Cincinnati  to  Indianapolis,  in  June,  1868. 

The  estimated  average  cost  of  the  construction  of 
the  road  per  mile  from  Indianapolis  to  Hamilton 
ready  for  the  rolling  stock  was  made  by  the  Chief 
Engineer  at  $21,516.75. 

The  Whiteioater  Valley  Railroad  from  Cincinnati, 
constructed  along  the  tow-path,  and,  part  of  the  way, 
in  the  bed  of  the  canal,  passes  through  the  county 
from  south  to  north  to  Cambridge  City,  its  northern 
terminus.  The  articles  of  association  of  the  company 
constructing  the  road  were  filed  with  the  Secretary  of 
State  June  8,  1865,  and  the  road  was  completed  to 
Connersville  in  the  spring  of  1867,  and  soon  there- 
after to  Cambridge  City.  Prom  the  latter  city  the 
road  passed  to  Hagerstown  on  the  Columbus,  Chicago 
&amp;  Indiana  Central. 

The  Fort  Waytie,  Cincinnati  &lt;&amp;  Louisville  Rail- 
road filed  its  articles  of  association  with  the  Secre- 
tary of  State  December  6,  1881.  The  road  was  origi- 
nally a  branch  of  the  C.  &amp;  I.  Junction  R.  R.,  extending 
from  Connersville  through  Cambridge  City  to  New 
Castle, and  was  known  as  the  Connersville  &amp;  New  Castle 
Junction  R.  R.  The  road  was  built  directly  after  the 
completion  of  the  C.  &amp;  I.  Junction  R.  R.  It  was 
subsequently  extended  and  became  known  as  the  Fort 
Wayne,  Muncie  &amp;  Cincinnati  Railroad. 

The  Jeff ersonville,  Madison  d- Indianapolis  R.  R. — 
The  railroad  crossing  the  northwestern  corner  of  the 
county,  running  from  Rushville  to  Cambridge  City, 
known  as  the  J.  M.  &amp;  I.,  of  which  it  is  a  branch,  was 
completed  July  4,  1867.  The  road  was  originally  a 
part  of  the  Lake  Erie  &amp;  Louisville  R.  R.,  extending 
from  Freemont,  Ohio,  to  Rushville,  Ind.,  and  by  con- 
nections to  Louisville. 

The  C.  H.  &amp;  L  R.  R.  has  15.3  miles  of  main  track 
in  the  county  of  Fayette;  the  Fort  Wayne,  Cincinnati 
&amp;  Louisville,  4.87  miles;  the  J.  M.  &amp;I.,  8.43  miles; 
and  the  Whiowater  Valley  14.16  miles,  making  in 
all  42.76  miles.

CHAPTER  IX. 


AGRICULTURE. 

IMPLEMENTS— CATTLE— HOUSES— HOGS— SHEEP— AGRICULTURAL  SOCIETIES   AND    FAIRS. 


"  Oh,  friendly  to  the  best  pursuits  of  man, 
Friendlj  to  thought,  to  virtue  and  to  peace, 
Domestic  life  in  rural  leisure  passed ! 
Pew  know  thy  value,  few  taste  thy  sweets. 
Though  many  boast  thy  favors,  and  affect 
To  understand  and  choose  thee  for  their  own." 

IN  the  early  settlement  of  this  section,  ponds, 
marshes  and  swamps  abounded  where  to  day  are 
found  fertile  and  cultivated  fields.  The  low  and 
marshy  ground  was  avoided  for  the  higher  grounds, 
not  only  on  account  of  the  wetness  but  for  sanitary 
purposes.  The  cabin  was  built  usually  by  or  near  a 
spring,  and  convenience  alone  was  considered  in  the 
location  of  other  buildings;  the  corn-crib  was  as  apt  to 
be  in  close  proximity  to  the  front  door  as  in  the  rear 
of  the  dwelling.  These  were  all  built  of  logs,  and 
often  in  their  riide,  round  form.  For  years  in  places 
no  fences  enclosed  the  pioneer's  possessions;  however, 
the  first  substantial  enclosures  did  not  differ  materi- 
ally from  the  old  "worm"  fence  constructed  of  rails 
as  those  of  to-day  appear.  The  soil  was  new  and  pro- 
ductive. For  years  the  crops  were  not  extensive,  for 
with  the  pioneer  so  remote  from  a  place  of  market,  it 
was  a  mere  question  of  home  supply.  Yet  his  re- 
moteness from  the  point  from  which  indispensable 
and  necessary  supplies  were  to  be  obtained,  was  a 
question  of  no  little  moment  to  him.  Salt,  iron  and 
other  commodities  are  indispensable  even  to  a  rude 
state  of  civilization,  and  great  hardships  were  under- 
gone to  secure  them.  As  acres  were  cleared  and  the 
crops  increased,  the  market  question  became  one  of 
consideration,  and  the  difficulty  of  getting  the  crops 
of  the  soil  to  the  nearest  market,  then  Cincinnati,  sit- 
uated sixty  miles  distant,  was  embarrassing.  These 
commodities  had  to  be  wagoned  over  hill  and  through 
dale,  the  way  often  being  almost  impassable,  as  the 
only  roads  were  mere  paths,  with  the  old  logs  and 
underbrush  cleared  out.  Some  few  are  yet  living 
who  will  remember  the  "three  notches"  along  these 
paths  indicating  a  public  highway.  Days  were  con- 
sumed in  making  the  journey,  and  little  encourage- 
ment had  the  farmer  to  increase  the  products  of  his 
fields  beyond  the  home  and  neighborhood  demand. 
Speaking  of  the  travel  over  one  of  these  roads,  one 
of  the  pioneers  of  Fayette  writes:  "Nothing  was  more 
common  than  lo  find  by  the  wayside  at  nearly  every 


place  where  good  water  could  be  had,  a  camping 
ground  where  the  weary  wagoner  had  camped,  as  also 
had  the  emigrant  with  his  family.  They  generally 
tied  their  horses  to  the  wagon-tongue,  on  which  was 
fastened  a  feed-trough,  which,  when  traveling,  they 
carried  swung  to  the  hind-gate  of  their  wagon,  for 
the  purpose  of  feeding  their  horses.  They  would 
build  a  fire  by  which  to  cook  their  scanty  meal,  and, 
if  night  had  overtaken  them,  the  ground  was  their 
bed  and  the  star-decked  heaven  their  canopy,  and 
fortunate  would  they  consider  themselves  if  they  had 
a  small  bundle  for  a  pillow." 

In  1810  bacon  sold  at  2J  cents  per  pound;  corn 
20  to  25  cents  per  bitshel;  but  there  was  a  season  of 
great  scarcity  when  it  sold  for  $1.25  per  bushel.  But- 
ter for  a  long  time  sold  for  3,  4  and  6  cents  per 
pound.  While  produce  was  so  low  the  farmer  had 
to  pay  50  cents  per  yard  for  muslin  that  can  now  be 
bought  for  8  or  10  cents.  Common  calicoes  cost  37^ 
cents  per  yard.  In  1820  oats  sold  at  8  cents  per 
bushel.  The  late  Dr.  Mason,  who  settled  in  the 
county,  in  his  autobiography,  in  referring  to  this  sub- 
ject says,  "Corn  was  often  sold  for  6  cents  a  bushel 
and  wheat  for  25  cents;  and  il  was  difficult  to  get 
money  at  that,  and  then  only  in  small  amounts.  Salt 
was  often  as  high  as  $2.50  and  $3.00  a  bushel.  When 
the  farmer  could  sell  his  pork  on  foot  at  the  rate  of 
$1.50  per  hundred,  net  weight,  he  felt  rich  and  began 
to  thrive."  But  the  pioneer  farmers  supplied  their 
homes  liberally  with  the  comforts  of  the  period  and 
contentment  and  happiness  generally  characterized 
their  homes. 

In  the  preparation  of  their  fields  for  crops  the 
mattock  or  hoe  was  called  into  service  ;  this  mat- 
tock, as  some  styled  it,  vras  a  tool  nearly  two  feet 
long,  one  end  of  which  was  a  blade  probably  about 
three  inches  wide,  strong  with  a  sharp  steel  edge, 
the  other  end  being  brought  to  a  sharp  edge  designed 
to  be  used  as  an  axe.  If  the  field  was  too  full  of 
stumps  it  was  planted  in  corn.  Sometimes  a  field 
would  be  grown  producing  what  was  termed  "  sick 
wheat."  Such  has  been  described  as  differing  little 
or  none  from  the  wheat  now  grown,  except  in  the  ap- 
pearance of  a  red  spot  on  the  grain  or  an  indication 
of  sprouting.     The  cause  for  wheat   thus  styled  has

by  some  been  attributed  in  this  locality  to  the  excess 
of  vegetable  matter  producing  an  excess  of  straw  and 
not  unfrequently  a  kind  of  rot  or  blight  in  many  of 
the  wheat  grains,  which  rendered  it  unfit  for  use  and 
was  so  denominated  from  the  effect  on  the  stomach  of 
one  eating  it. 

IMPLEMENTS. 

Agriculture    is  a  term    hardly   applicable  to  the 
farming  of  early  times.     The  implements  were  then 
necessarily  few  and  of  rude  and  simple  construction, 
and  could  be  manufactured  by  indifferent  blacksmiths. 
The  plows  used    were  the  bar-share  and  the    shovel. 
The  iron  part  of  the  former  consisted   of  a    bar    of 
iron  about  two  feet  long,  and  a  broad  share  of    iron 
welded   to  it.      At  the  extreme  point  was  a    coulter 
that  passed  through  a  beam  six  or  seven  feet  long,  to 
which     were     attached    handles     of    corresponding 
length.     The  mould   board  was  a  wooden    one    split 
out   of  winding   timber,    or    hewed  into   a  winding 
shape  in  order  to  turn    the  soil    over.      The   whole 
length  of  the  plow  from  the  fore  end  of  the  beam  to 
the  ends  of  the  handles  was  eight  or  ten  feet.     Newly 
cleared  ground  was  with  this    plow  broken  up  with 
great    difficulty.       On    this    subject  a  pioneer  says  : 
"  The  old  bar-share  plow,  with  a  coulter  and  wooden 
mould-board,  was  the  best  plow  then  in  use,  though 
by  far  the  greatest  number  used  only  the  shovel  plow, 
which  answered  an  excellent  purpose  in  the  loose  rich 
alluvium  soil  in  its  virgin  purity  free  from  weeds  and 
grass.      The  shovel  was  all  the  iron   connected    with 
the  plow,  and  not  unlike  those  in  use  at  the  present 
day.      The  gearing  or  harness  used  by  a  majority  of 
our  pioneers  was  so  novel  in  its  construction  that  I 
must  describe  it.      The  bridle  for  the  horse  was  an 
iron  bit.  the  balance  being  of  small  rope.     The  col- 
lar was  made  of  shucks  (the  husks  of  the  corn).     The 
hames  were  shaped  out  of  a  crooked  oak  or  a  hickory 
root,  fastened  at  the  top  with  a  cord  and  at  the  bottom 
in  the  same  way.      The  traces  were  of  rope,  the  back- 
band  being  of  _tow  cloth.      The  whiffle-tree  or  single- 
tree was  of  wood,  with  a  notch  on  each  end ;  the  trace 
hitched  by  a  loop    over  the  whifHe-tree,    and   to  the 
hame  through  a  hole.     The  whiffle-tree  was  attached 
to  the  double-tree  by  a  hickory  withe,  and  sometimes 
by  a  wooden  clevis  made  of  two  pieces  of  some  tough 
wood,  with  wooden  pin; 'the  double-tree  fastened  to 
the  end  of  the  plow  beam  by  the  same  wooden  form 
of  clevis  and  sometimes  an  iron  one.     To  the    rope 
bridle  was  attached  a  cord,  called  a  single  line,  by 
which  the  horse  was  driven.     By  far  the  largest  num- 
ber of    plow-teams  was    only  with    a    single    horse, 
geared  as  before  described,  and  hitched  to  the  shovel 
plow,  the  ground  broken  up,  crossed  off  and  tended  by 
the  same  plow  and  horse." 


The  land  in  the  early  history  of  this  region  was 
much  better  adapted  to  corn  than  small  grain,  espec- 
ially wheat,  owing  to  the  excess  of  vegetable  matter 
in  the  soil.  Sown  seed  was  "bushed  in"  by  a  sapling 
with  a  bushy  top,  or  by  a  bundle  of  brush  from  a  tree 
top,  dragged  butts  forward.  In  the  course  of  time 
the  roots  sprouts,  and  other  obstacles  gave  way  in  a 
measure,  and  the  ground  admitted  of  the  harrow, 
which  implement  was  triangular  in  form,  resembling 
the  letter  A;  the  teeth  were  probalily  as  heavy  again 
in  weight  as  those  now  used,  in  order  to  stand  the 
collision  with  the  roots  and  stumps  over  and  among 
which  they  were  to  be  drawn.  The  cast- iron  plow 
was  slowly  introduced,  the  harrow  was  improved,  the 
cultivator  invented,  drills  for  sowing  and  planting 
came  into  use,  and  other  labor-saving  implements,  and 
the  aspect  of  farming  wonderfully  changed. 

The  sickle  for  cutting  the  grain  was  first  used,  but 
as  soon  as  the  decay  and  removal  of  the  stumps  per- 
mitted of  a  larger  instrument  and  a  more  rapid  method, 
it  was  succeeded  by  the  cradle,  which  in  southwestern 
Ohio  gradually  became  into  use  at  a  period  beginning 
about  1825.  The  cradle  in  many  parts  of  the  country 
has  given  way,  while  in  some  sections  it  is  still  in 
use.  Reaping  with  the  sickle,  one  of  the  most  ancient 
of  farming  implements,  was  always  slow  and  labori- 
ous, Among  those  still  with  us  are  men  who  used 
the  sickle  and  know  how  to  swing  the  cradle  and 
scythe.  Reapers  gradually  superseded  the  cradle, 
and  mowers  the  scythe.  The  first  reaping  machines 
merely  cut  the  grain;  a  rake  was  necessary  to  gather 
the  grain  into  sheaves,  ready  for  the  binders.  Self- 
raking  machines  soon  followed,  and  about  1878  self- 
binding  machines  were  introduced.  Grain  was 
threshed  with  a  flail,  which,  in  its  rudest  form,  was 
made  of  a  hickory  sapling  about  two  inches  thick,  and 
seven  or  eight  feet  long.  About  two  feet  and  a  half 
from  one  end  it  was  roasted  in  the  fire,  and  at  this 
place  it  was  bruised  or  beaten,  so  as  to  cause  it  to 
bend.  With  this,  grain  was  beaten  out  on  the  ground, 
if  there  was  no  barn  floor.  Flails  were  often  made  in 
various  other  ways.  Another  of  the  old-fashioned 
method  of  threshing  the  grain,  and  the  most  common, 
was  by  tramping  it  out  with  horses.  There  were  no 
fanning-mills  to  separate  the  grain  from  the  chaff; 
to  raise  the  wind  a  linen  sheet  was  taken  from  the 
bed,  and  held  at  the  corners  by  two  men;  and  by  a 
semi  rotary  motion,  or  swinging  of  one  side  of  the 
sheet,  the  chaff  was  driven  from  the  falling  grain, the 
pure  wheat  lying  in  a  pile  ready  to  be  garnered.  The 
sheet  process  was  at  length  succeeded  by  the  fanning- 
mill.  This  slow  and  wasteful  method  of  separating 
the  grain  has  passed  into  history,  and  the  steam  oi- 
horse-power  threshing  machine  has  taken  its  place,  by 
which  the  grain  is  not  only  separated   from  the  chaff,

but  the  latter  carried  off  and  the  straw  borne  to  the 
stack  at  the  same  time. 

A  single  machine  now  receives  the  sheaves,  and 
delivers  the  cleaned  grain  at  the  rate  of  hundreds  of 
bushels  a  day. 

How  wonderfully  striking  is  the  change!  Imagine 
the  pioneer  with  sickle  ib  hand  entering  one  of 
Minnesota's  wheat-fields,  of  from  200  to  800,  or 
1,000  acres,  and  the  invention  of  the  self-binding 
reaper  will  be  appreciated. 

A  lad  of  ten  years  can  mow  from  fifty  to  one 
hundred  acres  of  meadow  in  an  ordinary  haying  sea- 
son, and  the  hay  is  all  raked  dui'ing  the  same  time 
by  a  single  hand. 

CATTLE. 

Many  of  the  early  cattle  of  Fayette  County  were 
brought  with  the  immigrants;  especially  did  those 
coming  from  the  adjacent  States,  Ohio  and  Kentucky, 
bring  with  them  a  cow  or  two.  Cattle  were  also 
brought  from  various  quarters,  but  all  were  then  of 
the  more  common  class,  but  in  every  way  sufficed  the 
wants  and  answered  the  purposes  of  the  pioneer 
times.  The  early  farmers  suffered  their  cattle  to  run 
at  large,  and  wanderingly  they  went  through  the 
woods,  over  uncultivated  grounds,  browsing  for  their 
living,  and  by  this  means  some  of  the  native  grasses 
were  extirpated  by  being- tramped  down  and  cropped 
off  early  in  the  season  before  giving  the  seeds  time 
to  form.  Whether  with  always  an  object  in  view  or 
not,  there  seems  not  to  have  been  a  step  taken  by  the 
pioneer  that  was  not  without  a  purpose  or  followed  by 
some  good  result.  Few  buildings  sheltered  their 
herds  from  the  cold  and  piercing  winds,  the  deep 
snows  and  chilling  rains  of  the  winters.  They  hov- 
ered around  the  stacks  of  wheat  straw,  which  served 
the  double  purpose  of  shelter  and  subsistence.  How- 
ever, after  corn  husking  in  the  fall  they  were  given 
these  fields  and  here  found  their  food,  and  at  inter- 
vals unhusked  corn  was  thrown  to  them,  the  ground 
constituting  their  feed  troughs. 

Kentucky  and  Ohio  early  manifested  an  interest 
in  the  improvement  of  the  stock  of  cattle,  and  from 
these  quarters  came  into  Fayette  County  a  better 
breed  of  this  animal.  Early  in  the  history  of  south- 
western t)hio  the  Shakers  at  Union  Village,  in  War- 
ren County,  were  in  possession  of  the  early  descend- 
ants of  the  Kentucky  importation  of  English  cattle, 
made  in  1817,  and  to  that  locality  importations  of 
thoroughbred  Short-horn  cattle  direct  from  Scotland 
were  made  in  1854. 

Cattle  from  Union  Village  were  brought  to  Fayette 
County,  but  at  what  period  we  have  no  definite 
knowledge.  Jfewton  Claypool,  Gen.  William  Cald- 
well and  William  Daily,  not  far  from  the  year  1838, 
went  to  Kentucky,  and   among  them  purchased  three 


heifers  and  one  bull,  descendants  of  the  importation 
of  Short-horn  cattle  of  1837,  which  were  brought  to 
Fayette  County.  The  bull  was  owned  by  the  three, 
and  there  being  but  one  Democrat  in  the  number  he 
insisted  on  naming  the  animal,  which  was  consented 
to,  and  the  same  was  christened  "Van  Buren." 

Not  a  great  while  subsequent  to  this  period  the 
man  of  whom  these  cattle  were  purchased  brought  a 
drove  of  the  same  breed  of  Short-horn  cattle  to  this 
locality. 

Several  years  subsequent  to  the  time  that  Messrs 
Claypool,  Caldwell  and  Dailey  brought  the  cattle  re- 
ferred to  above  to  this  locality,  the  Hon.  W.  W. 
Thrasher  purchased  a  Short-horn  bull  and  two  cows 
of  one  Cunningham,  who  resided  near  Lexington, 
Ky.,  which  he  brought  to  the  county. 

The  Devins  breed  were  to  some  extent  raised  in 
the  county,  but  were  not  very  popular  as  they  seemed 
not  to  have  answered  the  purpose — were  wanting  in 
size  for  beef  cattle,  and  they  never  became  numerous. 

Isaac  B.  Loder,  James  McCollem  and  Train 
Caldwell  brought  from  near  Lexington,  Ky.,  several 
thoroughbred  Short- horn  cattle;  and  among  the  num- 
ber was  the  bull  styled  "Bellmont."  This  was  in 
the  year  1853. 

From  time  to  time  excellent  Short-horn  cattle 
have  continued  to  be  brought  into  the  county,  until 
they  are  now  found  in  almost  every  locality.  Of 
recent  years  the  Jersey  cattle  has  made  its  appear- 
ance, and  is  a  favorite  with  some  on  account  of  the 
richness  of  the  milk  of  the  cow,  and  its  properties 
for  butter-making. 

From  reports  made,  through  the  President,  by  the 
Secretary  of  the  Agricultural  Society  at  intervals 
during  the  past  thirty  years,  we  gather  some  facts 
concerning  stock,  which  we  give  below: 

Report  of  1852. — "The  cattle  are  chiefly  driven 
from  hence  to  a  foreign  market,  and  the  number  sent 
from  this  county  during  the  past  year  is  estimated  at 
6,000." 

Report  of  1853. — "The  stock  cannot  be  beat  by 
any  other  county.  Caldwell  and  MeCullum's  bull,  of 
this  county,  took  the  first  premium  at  our  fair,  and 
was  equal  to  any  at  the  State  fair.  We  are  made, 
however,  to  deplore  the  number  of  scrubs  among  us. 
This  cannot  be  remedied  so  long  as  we  have  scrub 
farmers  among  us.  They  can  only  be  removed  by 
emigration  or  death." 

In  1856,  the  number  of  cattle  in  the  county  was 
valued  at  $5,627. 

HORSES. 

In  horses,  Fayette  has  claimed  a  high  grade  for 
some  years.  Oxen,  in  many  localities  in  the  early 
period  of  the  county's  history,  were  used  to  a  better 


80 


HISTOKY  OP   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


advantage  than  the  horse.  Over  such  roads  as  have 
been  described,  and  in  working  the  ground  among 
the  tangled  roots  and  stumps,  the  ox  was  well 
adapted,  and  to  many  played  well  his  part  in  prepar- 
ing the  way  for  a  succeeding  step  in  the  progress  of 
things.  In  1830  there  were  in  the  county  282  work- 
ing oxen.  Judging  from  the  Secretary's  report  to  the 
State  Board  of  Agriculture  in  1880,  the  improvement 
in  the  horse  has,  perhaps,  hardly  kept  pace  with  the 
advancement  in  other  directions.  "The  exhibition  of 
horses,  cattle,  sheep,  hogs  and  poultry  showed  im- 
provement, but  not  so  marked  in  the  horse  depart- 
ment, being  evident  that  the  introduction  of  a  little 
more  good  blood  would  be  advantageous. "  However, 
throughout  the  county  is  a  good  stock  of  horses  of  all 
classes,  which  is  steadily  advancing  in  improvement. 
Many  horses  daily  appear  on  the  streets  of  Conners- 
ville  that  reflect  great  credit  on  parties  engaged  in 
breeding,  raising  and  handling  the  animal. 

Among  some  of  the  early  breeds  of  horses  in  the 
county  were  the  "Kentucky  Whip."  A  blood  bay  horse 
(with  black  legs,  mane  and  tail)  by  this  name  was 
advertised  in  Connersville  in  1829.  In  1832  Merril 
Williams  advertised  "Hilander,"  an  iron  gray  horse, 
sixteen  hands  high.  Along  about  this  period  was 
introduced  into  the  county  a  horse  styled  "Comet.' 
"Top  Gallant"  was  another  of  the  early  horses  at 
Connersville.  He  was  in  charge  of  John  and  Lot 
Abraham,  and  was  described  as  a  dark  chestnut  sorrel, 
sixteen  hands  high,  lofty  carriage  and  a  good  mover. 
He  was  brought  from  the  State  of  Georgia  to  Butler 
County,  Ohio,  by  a  Mr.  Titsworth;  was  sired  by  the 
imported  horse  "Matchless  Bob"— his  dam  by  the 
imported  horse  "Mast,''  and  his  grand  dam  by  the 
imported  horse  "Diamond."  About  1835  Josiah 
Piper  brought  a  dun  horse  from  Kentucky,  which 
made  noticeable  and  valuable  improvement  in  the 
horses  of  this  section. 

The  "Morgan,"  the  "Bellfounder,"  the  "Bashaw," 
the  "Whip,"  the"HambletoniaD,"  the  "Second  Cad- 
mus," the  "Hilander"  stock,  have  been  introduced  at 
different  periods.  The  improvements  in  the  horse  are 
largely  due  to  the  infusion  of  the  blood  of  the  thorough- 
bred. The  strains  of  blood  have  not  been  kept  dis- 
tinct, but  the  tendency  has  been  to  amalgamate  it  with 
the  stock  already  in  use. 

The  Norman  and  the  Clydesdale  stock  have  been 
within  recent  years  brought  into  the  county. 

In  1852  the  following  report  on  this  animal  was 
sent  from  the  county  to  the  Secretary  of  the  State 
Board  of  Agriculture: 

"There  has  been  a  great  increase,  both  in  the 
quality  and  number  of  this  most  useful  animal, 
during  the  past  year  in  this  county.  The  number  is 
estimated   at  about   6,000    head      The   prices   have 


been  extraordinarily  high,  ranging  from  $100  to 
$200,  for  good,  serviceable  geldings,  and  mares  in 
proportion. " 

The  report  of  the  following  year  read:  "Our 
farmers  are  paying  attention  to  the  improvement  of 
horses  and  mules.  We  have  as  fine  horses,  mares  and 
jacks  in  this  as  in  any  other  county  in  the  State." 

HOGS. 

A  writer  on  the  subject  of  the  swine  of  the  early 
settlers  gives  this  glowing  description  of  them: 
"They  were  long  and  slim,  long-snouted  and  long- 
legged,  with  an  arched  back,  and  bristles  erect  from 
the  back  of  the  head  to  the  tail,  slab-sided,  active 
and  healthy.  The  'sapling-splitter'  and  'razor- 
back,'  as  he  was  called,  was  ever  in  the  search  for 
food,  and  quick  to  take  alarm.  He  was  capable  of 
making  a  heavy  hog,  but  required  two  years  or  more 
to  mature,  and,  until  a  short  time  before  butchering 
or  marketing,  was  suifered  to  run  at  large,  subsisting 
mainly  as  a  forager,  and  in  the  fall  fattening  on  the 
'  mast.' " 

What  a  contrasf  between  the  hogs  of  that  period 
and  those  of  1884!  Probably  no  change  wrought  in 
the  stock  of  the  farmer  is  so  marked  as  in  this  ani- 
mal. Those  of  to-day  mature  early  and  are  almost 
the  reverse  of  the  "razor-back,"  having  a  small  head, 
small  ear,  short  neck,  with  a  long  body  and  hams, 
and  in  general  shape  are  almost  square,  and  are  capa- 
ble of  taking  on  250  pounds  of  flesh  in  eight  or  ten 
months. 

The  people  of  Fayette  County  having  in  past 
years  paid  considerable  attention  to  the  raising  of 
swine,  a  commodity  which  has  added  greatly  to  the 
wealth  of  the  farmers,  cannot  fail  to  be  interested  in 
the  history  of  the  hogs  that  have  been  chiefly  among 
them,  hence  we  give  them  the  benefit  of  the  result 
of  a  thorough  research  on  the  subject  made  by  Josiah 
Morrow,  Esq.,  of  Lebanon,  Ohio,  a^  published  in  the 
"  History  of  Warren  County,  Ohio,"  of  which  he  is  the 
author : 

"In  1816  John  Wallace,  then  a  Trustee  of  the 
Shaker  Society,  visited  Philadelphia  on  business  and 
was  shown  what  was  called  the  Big  China  hogs.  He 
was  pleased  with  them  and  purchased  four  hogs,  and 
brought  them  the  same  season  to  Union  Village. 
These  four  hogs  were  entirely  white  except  one,  upon 
which  were  some  sandy  spots,  in  which  appeared 
small  black  spots.  They  were  represented  to  be 
either  imported  or  the  immediate  descendants  of 
imported  stock,  and  are  believed  to  have  been  the 
first  China  hogs  in  southwestern  Ohio.  Subsequently 
other  China  hogs  were  introduced.  TJjey  were  exten- 
sively raised  and  crossed  with  the  best  breeds  then 
existing,  and  the  product  of  these  crosses  constituted

a  breed  of  fine  qualities,  which  was  generally  known 
as  the  '  Warren  County  hog,'  sometimes  as  the 
'  Shaker  ho^.'  These  hogs  increased  in  good  quali- 
ties and  were  extensively  bred  in  great  numbers  in 
the  great  corn  producing  regions  of  Warren  and 
Butler  Counties. 

"  The  Berkshires  were  introduced  into  Warren 
County 'in  1835  and  1836,  by  Mr.  Munsou  Beach,  who 
operated  in  connection  with  his  brother,  Louis  Beach, 
then  a  prominent  merchant  in  the  city  of  New  York. 
Subsequently  they  made  other  shipments  of  the  same 
stock  to  Warren  and  Butler  Counties.  The  Berk- 
shires introduced  by  the  Messrs.  Beach  were  gener- 
ally black,  with  occasional  marks  of  white,  either  on 
the  feet,  the  tip  of  the  tail  or  in  the  face.  They 
were  muscular,  active  and  round  bodied  hogs,  and, 
in  most  cases,  had  sharp  pointed,  upright  ears.  Some 
families,  however,  were  large  in  size,  deep  in  their 
bodies,  with  ears  that  lopped. 

"  The  Irish  Grazier  breed  of  hogs  was  imported 
direct  into  southwestern  Ohio,  by  William  Neif,  Esq., 
of  Cincinnati,  about  1839.  The  Graziers  were  white 
with  only  an  occasional  sandy  spot  which  appeared 
about  the  eyes. 

"  These  two  breeds  — the  Berkshires  and  Irish 
Graziers — were  extensively  used  in  making  crosses  by 
tho  best  breeders  in  Warren  and  Butler  Counties, 
and  to  some  extent  in  Clinton  and  Hamilton  Coun- 
ties. Having  been  carefully  bred  and  intermixed 
with  the  descendants  and  crosses  of  the  Big  China 
with  other  breeds,  the  stock  thus  produced  consti- 
tuted the  true  and  original  basis  of  what  is  now  known 
as  the  Magie  or  Poland-China  hogs. 

'  "  Many  of  the  most  successful  breeders  of  these 
hogs  resided  in  the  vicinity  of  Monroe,  near  the  War- 
ren and  Butler  County  line.  Since  18-40  no  new 
blood  has  been  introduced.  In  1870  the  Illinois 
Swine  Breeders'  Association  resolved  to  call  these 
hogs  the  '  Magie  breed '  (pronounced  Magee),  from 
the  name  of  one  of  the  most  successful  breeders  of 
the  stock  in  Butler  County,  but  Poland-China  is  now 
the  established  name.  The  first  part  of  this  name, 
however,  is  a  misnomer,  as  the  best  authorities  agree 
that  there  never  was  a  breed  of  hogs  known  as  the 
Poland  in  the  Miami  Valley,  and  no  Poland  cross 
entered  into  the  formation  of  tho  breed.  The  first 
part  of  the  name  is  believed  to  have  originated  from 
the  fact  that  a  Polandor,  residing  in  Hamilton  County, 
having  purchased  some  of  the  Shaker  or  Warren 
County  hogs,  many  years  ago,  disposed  of  them  to 
purchasers  who  named  them  Poland  or  Polander 
hogs.  The  National  Convention  of  Swine  Breeders 
of  1872  retained  this  misnomer  for  the  reason  that 
the  great  mass  of  breeders  so  called  the  breed,  and 
to  change  a  name  generally  used  is  difficult." 


It  is  thought  that  Jeremiah  May  brought  the  first 
of  this  breed  to  the  county  about  the  year  1832,  from 
Warren  County,  Ohio.  At  any  rate,  this  breed  of 
hogs  found  its  way  into  Fayette  County,  many  years 
ago,  and  with  little  exception  has  been  the  hog  of 
this  section  ever  since.  In  1851,  in  answer  to  some 
interrogatories  from  the  State  Board  of  Agriculture, 
the  Hon.  Matthew  R.  Hull,  then  a  resident  of  the 
county,  since  deceased,  replied  as  relates  to  the  hog 
as  follows: 

"  The  Poland,  crossed  upon  the  Byfield  and  Rus- 
sian, exceed  all  others  for  beauty,  size  and  profit. 
They  are  a  good  grass  hog,  and  are  sufficiently  lively 
and  sufficiently  industrious  to  make  a  good  living  off 
of  good  pasture.  They  mature  early,  have  a  small 
head,  small  ear,  short  neck,  thick  shoulder,  long  body 
and  long  ham,  and  are  capable  of  bearing  more  fat 
than  any  other  kind  we  have  had  amongst  us.  They 
are  familiarly  known  here  as  the  '  Warren  County 
hog.'  McGee  (should  be  Magie),  of  Butler  County, 
drives  no  other  kind  of  hogs.  His  droves  have  aver- 
aged him  more  than  410  pounds  for  several  years  in 
Cincinnati.  This  kind  may  be  had  in  our  neighbor- 
hood." 

For  many  years  Connersville  was  quite  an  exten- 
sive pork  market,  where  thousands  of  hogs  were  an- 
nually slaughtered  and  packed.  The  report  sent  to 
the  State  Board  of  Agriculture  in  1852  was  as  fol- 
lows: "  22,000  hogs  have  been  slaughtered  at  and 
packed  at  Connersville  during  the  past  season,  which 
will  average  220  pounds  per  bead,  for  which  the 
average  price  paid  was  $5.50  percwt.  Some  of  these 
were  from  neighboring  counties,  but  it  is  estimated 
that  equally  as  many  as,  if  not  more  than,  were 
brought  to  the  market  from  other  counties,  were 
driven  from  this  county  to  a  foreign  market." 

The  report  of  1853  exhibits:  "  The  hogs  in  this 
county,  and  especially  in  Jennings  Township,  are 
superior,  or  at  least  equal,  to  any  in  the  United 
States.  James  D.  Ross  &amp;  Bros,  have  hogs  that  are 
hard  to  duplicate.  The  pork  butchered  at  Conners- 
ville this  year  will  exceed  last  by  at  least  several 
thousand  head.  It  may  reach  25,000."  The  report 
of  1859-60  showed  that  some  20,000  hogs  were 
packed  at  Connersville. 

SHEEP. 

Some  time  in  the  decade  between  1830  and  1840 
W.  W.  Thrasher,  residing  on  the  western  border  of 
the  county,  brought  some  fine  sheep  to  that  section 
from  near  Lexington,  Ky.,  of  the  breed  known  as 
"  Cotswold,"  which  were  among  the  first,  if  not  the 
first,  fine  wool  sheep  introduced  into  the  county.  Mr. 
Thrasher  still  breeds  this  variety,  and  has  in  the  in- 
terim raised  and  sold  perhaps  thousands.     The  report 


84 


HISTORY    OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


made  to  the  State  Board  of  Agriculture  ou  this  ani- 
mal in  1852  showed  that  the  total  number  in  the 
county  then  was  estimated  at  15,000  head.  Much 
interest  was  then  manifested  in  the  growing  of  wool, 
and  an  encouragiDg  number  of  most  valuable  breeds 
had  been  imported  and  propagated.  The  price  of 
the  common  breeds  was  from  $1  to  $1  50  per  head. 
The  report  of  1853:  "  Many  of  our  farmers  are  im- 
proving their  stock  of  sheep  and  are  growing  more 
wool  than  in  former  years.  Mr.  Miner  Meeker,  Will- 
iam Thomas,  John  Caldwell,  and  the  undersigned, 
President  (M.  R.  Hull),  have  each  tine  flocks  of  fine- 
wooled  sheep. ' ' 

In  1878  it  was  shown  by  the  Secretary's  report  of 
the  Fayette  County  Agricultural  Society  that  the 
wool-growing  interest  of  the  county  was  "  on  the 
wane."  For  1870  there  were  reported  8,105  head  of 
sheep  in  the  county,  and  for  the  year  1877  only 
3,989  head. 

AGRIOnLTUEAL    SOCIETIES    AND    FAIRS. 

In  the  summer  of  1834  an  attempt  was  made  to 
form  an  agricultural  society  in  F''ayette  County. 
Horace  VanVleet,  then  editor  of  the  Watchman,  pub- 
lished at  Connersville,  wrote  several  articles  on  agri- 
culture and  the  importance  of  an  agricultural  society, 
and,  on  solicitation,  published  a  call  for  a  meeting, 
which  was  responded  to,  and  resulted  in  the  appoint- 
ment of  Gen.  Caldwell  for  President  and  Mr.  Van 
Vleet,  Secretary.  About  $40  was  subscribed  and 
paid  in  for  the  organization  to  Mr.  Van  Vleet.  Soon 
after  (in  October.  1834,)  Mr.  VanVleet  died.  No 
claim  was  made  tor  the  agricultural  fund,  and  so 
failed  the  first  attempt  to  organize  an  agricultural 
society. 

In  the  year  1841  a  call  was  published  for  an  agri- 
cultural meeting,  to  be  held  on  the  4th  of  July, 
which  was  responded  to  in  the  then  old  court  house. 
Dr.  Philip  Mason  was  appointed  President,  and 
Charles  Shipley,  Secretary.  An  address  was  read  by 
Dr.  Mason.  There  was  a  lack  of  animation  in  the 
meeting,  which  showed  that  the  community  were  not 
quite  prepared  for  a  permanent  organization.  Hon. 
S.  W.  Parker  was  present  and  made  a  few  remarks. 
He  then  turned  the  meeting  to  account  by  getting 
subscribers  to  the  Indiana  Farmer,  then  published 
at  Indianapolis,  and  edited  by  the  now  celebrated 
Henry  Ward  Beecher,  and  succeeded  in  less  than  an 
hour  in  getting  fifty- four  subscribers.  So  ended  the 
second  attempt. 

During  the  year  1851  seven  agricultural  meetings 
were  held  to  establish  an  agricultural  society.  The 
attempt  was  discouraging,  but  several  who  were  faith- 
ful to  the  cause  persevered,  and  success  crowned  their 
efforts.      On  the  18th  of  October,    1851,    they  suc- 


ceeded in  organizing  permanently  and  adopted  a  con- 
stitution. 

John  Spivey  was  elected  President,  and  D.  W. 
Welty,  Secretary.  According  to  the  official  report, 
as  required  and  sent  up  to  the  State  Board  of  Agri- 
culture, $48  were  received  by  the  society.  On  account 
of  the  late  period,  no  exhibition  or  fair  was  held, 
and  the  money  was  loaned  out.  In  1852  the  first  fair 
was  held.  The  receipts  were  $1,052.06,  the  expenses 
$647.54,  leaving  a  fair  balance  in  the  treasury,  which 
was  very  flattering  for  the  beginning.  The  fair  con- 
tinued to  prosper,  the  receipts  reaching  as  high  as 
$3,233,  and  expenses  in  proportion,  until  December, 
1861,  when  the  society  declared  its  intention  to 
dissolve  and  transfer  its  interest  to  a  joint  stock  asso- 
ciation. A  committee  was  appointed  and  the  affairs 
of  the  organization  were  closed  up. 

Other  of  the  early  Presidents  of  the  society  were 
Matthew  R.  Hull  and  William  Watton. 

Up  to  the  fall  of  1865  the  fairs  were  held  on 
leased  premises,  but  in  the  fall  of  that  year  twenty- 
six  acres  of  ground  were  purchased  of  A.  J.  Clay- 
pool,  situated  about  one  mile  north  of  the  court  house 
'n  Connersville,  upon  which  were  subsequently  erected 
suitable  buildings.  In  1870  these  grounds  were  val- 
ued at  $20,000. 

The  society  organized  with  a  membership  of  146; 
in  1852  it  had  increased  to  410,  and  in  1856  to  1,213. 

At  the  first  fair  held  A.  O.  Saxon  was  awarded  the 
first  premium  for  the  best  cultivated  farm,  and  Ben- 
jamin Thomas  the  second  premium  for  the  second 
best. 

One  of  the  prominent  features  of  the  fair  held  in 
1858  was  that  the  late  Hon.  Horace  Greeley,  of  New 
York  City,  vras  present,  and  delivered  an  address. 
Premiums  had  been  offered  for  this  fair  for  the  "  best 
cultivated  and  improved  farm,"  for  which  there  were 
two  entries,  Hon.  S.  W.  Parker  and  Alexander 
Heron,  Esq.  (the  present  Hon.  Secretary,  State  Board 
of  Agriculture).  The  committee  being  unable  to 
determine  whether  there  was  a  preponderance  for 
either,  recommended  a  premium  to  each,  to  the  former 
for  the  best  improved  farm,  and  to  the  latter  for  the 
best  cultivated  farm.  A  premium  was  also  offered 
for  the  best  essay  on  agriculture,  which  was  awarded 
to  Mr.  Samuel  Little. 

During  the  eleven  years  of  its  existence  about 
$23,000  was  handled  by  the  society. 

The  joint  stock  association  referred  to  above  was 
known  as  the  Fayette  County  Joint  Stock  Agricult- 
ural and  Mechanical  Society,  and  was  organized 
December  21,  1861. 

The  earliest  report  we  had  access  to  of  this  soci- 
ety was  the  one  made  in  1867,  at  which  time  A.  B. 
Claypool,  Esq.,  was  the  President.     The  entries  for 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

this  year  were  as  follows:  Live  stock,  220;  mechani- 
cal, 90;  agricultural,  277;  miscellaneous,  190. 
Amount  of  premiums — live  stock,  $1,242;  mechani- 
cal, 1404;  miscellaneous,  $118.  The  total  receipts 
of  the  fair,  $4,480.40. 

This  society,  according  to  a  report  of  the  Secretary, 
met  with  a  series  of  reverses  discouraging  to  the  man- 
agers, and  no  fair  was  held  in  1876 — the  only  year 
without  a  fair  since  the  organization  of  the  society 
which  held  the  first  fair  in  1852.  The  accumulation 
of  debt  against  the  society  caused  the  property  of  the 
association  to  change  hands,  which  was  secured  by  a 
new  organization  under  the  title  of  the  Eastern  Indi- 
ana Agricultural,  Mechanical  and  Trotting  Park  Asso- 
ciation. This  organization  was  effected  August  5, 
1877,  with  a  capital  stock  of  $6,000. 

Following  is  the  Secretary's  report  for  1877: 


"During  the  last  decade  the  live  stock  interest 
has  predominated,  but  latterly  it  is  giving  way  to  the 
raising  of  grain;  about  6,000  head  of  hogs  were  lost 
in  the  past  season  by  cholera.  Cattle  raising  is  prof- 
itable, and  more  attention  is  given  to  the  breeding  of 
improved  stock;  3,676  head  reported  this  over  3,322 
last  year.  More  attention  is  given  to  the  breeding  of 
good  horses,  especially  heavy  di-aft  horses,  for  which 
this  county  is  becoming  famous.  Statistics  show  an 
increase  in  number,  1,420  head  against  1,328  the  year 
before.  Mules  are  used  more  than  formerly,  and  are 
much  improved  in  size  and  appearance." 

Fairs  have  been  held  annually  ever  since,  and 
conducted  successfully.  At  a  meeting  of  the  associ- 
ation held  February  12,  1884,  the  stock-holders  sur- 
rendered their  charter  and  resolved  to  offer  their 
grounds  for  sale.

POLITICAL. 

RESULTS  OF  ELECTIONS,  POLITICAL  EXTRACTS  AND  NOTES— MEMBERS  OF  CONGRESS— MEMBERS  OF  THE  GENERAL 

ASSEMBLY. 


IN  1819,  at  the  time  of  the  organization  of  Fayette 
County,  the  public  affairs  of  the  State  were  in  the 
hands  of  the  Hendricks,  Jennings,  and  Noble  divi- 
sions of  one  political  party. 

RESULTS  OF  ELECTIONS — POLITICAL  EXTRACTS  AND  NOTES. 

In  the  month  of  August  of  that  year,  the  first 
election  in  the  new  county  of  Fayette  for  State  offi- 
cers was  held.  The  candidates  for  Governor  were 
Jonathan  Jennings  and  Christopher  Harrison,  and 
the  vote  in  the  five  townships  into  which  the  county 
had  been  divided,  for  these  men  were  as  follows: 

.lENNINGS.      HARRISON' 

Connersville 364  7 

Brownsville  86 

Harrison  109  8 

Jennings 21  1 

Columbia 51  4 

Totals 631  20 

For  State  Senator,  William  C.  Drew  received  367 
votes  in  the  county,  and  for  the  same  office  James 
Gondie,  73  votes. 

The  candidates  for  the  office  of  Representative 
in  the  State  Legislature  were  Robert  Hill,  Enoch  D. 
John,  Jacob  Graves,  Robert  Swann,  John  Sutherland, 
Conrad  Sailor,  Zachariah  Ferguson,  Allen  Crisler, 
Joseph  Holeman,  Andrew  Wallace,  Simon  Yandes, 
John  Brison,  Jonathan  Kid  well  and  JIatthew  Sparks; 
and  they  received  49,  324„116,    61,    106,  190,  156, 


408,  50,  56,  75,  140,  17  and  14  votes  respectively. 

There  were  ten  candidates  for  the  office  of  Sher- 
iff and  six  for  that  of  Coroner. 

In  1820  there  was  no  opposition  to  James  Monroe, 
and  he  was  re-elected  President  of  the  United  States, 
with  the  electoral  vote  of  every  State  in  the  Union. 
Affairs  in  the  State  were  going  on  quietly  under  the 
control  of  the  several  divisions  above  referred  to,  and 
the  people  of  Fayette  were  hardly  aware  that  a  Pres- 
idential election  had  taken  place,  and  yet  as  good  and 
quiet  an  administration  followed  as  any  that  is  likely 
to  be  produced  by  our  exciting  elections  at  this  day. 

At  the  election  for  Governor  in  August,  1822,  the 
votes  of  Fayette  stood:  William  Hendricks,  687; 
Erasmus  Powell,  314.  Two  years  later  the  vote  of 
the  county  stood:  for  President,  Jackson,  456;  Clay, 
393;  Adams,  122.  The  vote  of  Connersville  Town- 
ship standing:  354  for  Jackson,  277  for  Clay  and  92 
for  Adams.  Posey  Township  lacked  2  votes  only  of 
being  solid  for  Jackson^the  2  were  given  for  Clay; 
Columbia  Township  gave,  in  proportion  to  its  popu- 
lation, the  largest  Clay  vote — 44. 

The  candidates  in  1828  for  President  were 
Andrew  Jackson  and  John  Quincy  Adams.  The  peo- 
ple of  Indiana  gave  the  electoral  vote  of  the  State  to 
the  former,  believing,  it  seems,  that  he  was  a  friend 
to  the  Protecting  Sy.stem,  and  a  friend  to  Internal 
Improvements,  but  in  which  they  were  disappointed, 


86 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


and  in  1831  retalliated  by  eleeking  Gen.  James 
Noble  to  the  Gubernatorial  chair  by  a  majority  of 
2,320. 

The  Jackson  vote  in  Fayette  in  1828  was  050, 
against  516  for  Adams. 

The  great  national  question  which  at  this  time 
was  disturbing  the  Itepublic,  was  not  without  its 
influence  upon  all  elections  throughout  the  country, 
from  the  most  humble  to  the  most  exalted  stations. 
The  names  of  the  two  national  political  parties  at 
this  period  were  the  National  Eepublican  and  the 
Democratic.  In  the  Congressional  election  in  the 
district  of  which  Fayette  then  constituted  a  part,  the 
people  of  both  parties,  in  a  measure,  threw  off  the 
servile  trammels  of  bigoted  partyism,  and  voted  like 
rational  men.  The  Presidential  question  probably 
never  ran  higher.  Gen.  Jonathan  McCarty,  of  Con- 
nersville,  and  Judge  John  Tost,  of  Brookville,  were 
in  the  field  alone,  Oliver  H.  Smith,  who  was  then  a 
member  of  Congress  from  this  district,  having  pre- 
viously withdrawn  from  the  contest,  giving  in  print 
the  following  as  the  cause: 

"  It  was  not  known  to  me  at  the  time  I  declared 
myself  a  candidate  that  there  would  be  more  than  one 
candidate  besides  myself,  but  on  my  return  I  found 
that  two  other  candidates  were  before  the  people,  and 
from  all  that  I  could  learn,  theresult  would  be,  should 
we  all  continue,  that  a  majority  of  the  number  would 
be  defeated  by  a  minority,  in  the  election  of  either 
of  the  candidates,  and  having  no  desire  myself  to  be 
continued  the  representative  of  this  district,  against 
the  will  of  a  majority  of  the  electors,  which  from  the 
excitement  that  has  been  created,  and  the  false  state- 
ments which  have  beeu  circulated  in  my  absence,  I 
am  satisfied  would  be  the  case  in  the  event  of  my  elec- 
tion, I  have  resolved  not  to  be  a  candidate." 

Judge  Test  and  Mr.  Smith  were  of  the  National 
Eepublican  Party,  and  Gen.  McCarty  of  the  Demo- 
cratic. The  parties  were  nearly  equal  in  number; 
the  conflict  resulted  in  the  election  of  Judge  Test  by 
a  triumphant  majority. 

During  the  period  of  which  we  have  been  writing 
candidates  were  generally  placed  before  the  people 
without  the  intervention  of  party  caucus,  a  political 
convention  or  a  primary  election.  After  the  estab- 
lishment of  a  newspaper  in  Fayette  County,  candi- 
dates for  political  favor  usually  announced  themselves, 
or  were  announced  by  others  through  its  columns.  In 
1820,  when  Oliver  H.  Smith  became  a  candidate  for 
Congress,  he  remarks:  "Stump  speaking  was  just 
coming  in  fashion;  the  people  met  our  appointments 
by  thousands." 

In  1830  the  names  of  several  candidates  for  the 
State  Legislature  had  been  announced  in  the  press  of 
the  county, and  in  the  Political  Clarion  of  July  10  of 


the  same   year    appeared  the   following,  signed   by 
"many  voters:  " 

"  It  is  very  important  to  the  people  to  know  the 
sentiments  of  those  who  aspire  to  the  honor  of  rep- 
resenting them  on  the  great  and  leading  measures  of 
the  State  and  Federal  Governments.  It  imposes  too 
great  a  burden  on  candidates  to  require  them  to  give 
these  opinions  personally  to  all,  but  through  a  public 
newspaper  will  be  found  a  medium  of  communication 
convenient  for  them,  and  more  beneficial  to  the  peo- 
ple. In  this  manner  the  candidates  will  neither  be 
so  liable  to  be  misunderstood,  nor  their  sentiments  so 
Subject  to  the  misrepresentation  of  the  designing.  It 
is  believed,  from  the  character  of  the  candidates  before 
the  people  of  this  county  for  Representatives,  that 
none  of  them  will  refuse  for  one  moment  to  answer 
through  the  press  such  questions  as  may  tend  to  give 
the  people  necessai'y  information  in  relation  to  their 
opinions  concerning  the  groat,  public  measures  in 
which  the  people  are  so  deeply  interested.  Should 
any  fail  or  refuse  to  answer  explicitly,  the  people 
may  be  able  to  judge  of  that  man. 

"  Candidates,  will  you  answer  the  people  the  fol- 
lowing questions? 

"  1.  Do  you  justify  the  President  of  the  United 
States  in  putting  his  veto  on  the  several  bills  passed 
during  the  last  session  of  Congress,  in  favor  of  inter- 
nal improvements? 

"2.  Do  you  believe,  with  the  present  Administra- 
tion, that  Congress  has  no  power  to  appropriate 
money  to  be  expended  within  the  States,  on  works  of 
internal  improvements,  but  that  all  money  expended 
must  be  confined  to  the  Territories? 

"  3.  Do  you  believe  that  Congress  has  the  power  to 
make  an  appropriation  to  assist  in  making  a  turn- 
pike road  from  Lawrenceburg  to  Fort  Wayne,  and  if 
Congress  should  pass  such  an  act  would  j'ou  justify 
the  President  in  putting  his  veto  on  it,  and  thus 
defeat  the  appropriation? 

"  4.  Do  you  approve  of  the  doctrines  of  rewarding 
those  who  vote  for  the  President  with  all  the  offices 
and  punishing  those  who  voted  against  him,  by  turn- 
ing them  out  of  office  ? 

"  5.  Do  you  believe  that  the  Senate  of  the  United 
States  have  a  right  to  know  the  reasons  why  removals 
and  appointments  submitted  for  their  '  advice  and 
consent'  were  made;  or  do  you  believe  that  the 
Senate  has  no  control  over  the  nominations  of  the 
President,  except  to  register  his  decrees? 

"  6.  Do  you  believe  the  policy  adopted  by  this 
administration  in  relation  to  the  Indians,  correct? 

"  7.  Would  you  vote  for  a  resolution  requesting 
Congress  to  aid  us  in  contemplated  road  from  Law- 
renceburg to  Fort  Wayne  which  must  pass  through 
this  county?

"  8.  Would  you  vote  for  an  appropriation  of  $5,000 
or  $6,000  of  the  people's  money  to  furnish  the  Gov- 
ernor's house  with  carpets,  side-boards,  looking- 
glasses,  etc.,  etc. 

"  The  above  questions  are  easily  answered,  and  we 
hope  to  see  your  answers  in  the  next  Clarion,  as  we 
have  a  right  to  know  your  opinions  before  we  are 
called  upon  to  select  two  out  of  your  number  to  rep- 
resent us." 

The  personal  popularity  of  the  candidate  and  his 
fitness  for  the  oiBce  were  of  paramount  importance 
to  his  views  on  national  political  questions. 

On  this  point  we  have  an  illustration  in  the  elec- 
tion referred  to  above  in  the  choice  for  Representatives. 

The  Palladium,  then  printed  at  Lawrencebarg,  was 
exulting  in  consequence  of  the  result  of  the  election 
in  this  county  and  the  sample  it  gave  of  the  ' '  tre- 
mendous effect  of  the  veto,''  which  brought  forth  the 
following  from  the  editor  of  the  Clarion: 

"This  county  has  long  been  one  of  the  most 
decidedly  Jacksonian  in  the  State.  At  the  late  elec- 
tion, we  had  two  Representatives  to  select  for  the 
General  Assembly,  and  five  Jacksonians  oifored  them- 
selves as  candidates.  The  veto  message  appeared, 
and  forthwith  three  of  the  five  renounced  the  admin- 
istration and  are  now  friendly  to  the  cause  of  Mr. 
Clay.  The  Palladium  grossly  misrepresents  us, 
when  it  states  that  Col.  Hankins  was  elected  in 
'  opposition  to  the  joint  eiforts  of  the  Clarion,  the 
Times  and  other  Clay  papers.'  So  far  from  this  gen- 
tleman's being  '  opposed '  as  stated,  be  was  brought 
out  by  the  friends  of  Mr.  Clay,  and  would  not  have 
been  elected  had  they  not  supported  him.  Even  the 
editor  of  the  Clarion  gave  him  his  support.  The 
other  gentleman  that  was  elected  received  between 
100  and  200  votes  from  the  friends  of  Mr.  Clay.  So 
long  as  there  is  a  majority  of  Jacksonians  in  Fayette 
CouQty,  and  they  are  disposed  to  send  one  of  their 
friends  to  the  Legislature,  the  Clarion  will  be  far 
from  affording  'opposition.'  But  whilst  we  believe 
that  injurious  political  tenets  are  abroad,  we  shall 
never  withold  one  'jot  nor  tittle'  of  our  energy  to 
convince  and  reform  those  who  hold  them.  But  we 
hope  ever  to  have  our  skirts  clear  of  even  one  effort 
to  contravene  the  will  of  the  majority,  notwithstand- 
ing the  example  given  by  the  Administration.  In 
relation  to  the  effect  of  the  veto  in  Indiana,  our 
most  sanguine  expectations  are  more  than  realized, 
luthis  county  we  had  a  very  pretty  test  of  its  "  effect ' 
on  the  candidates  for  the  Legislature;  and  it  will 
also  be  found,  when  our  citizens,  generally,  are  called 
upon  to  attest  their  affection  for  Mr.  Clay,  that  they 
have  not  been  very  fastidious  concerning  the  same 
matter." 

The  vote  for  President  in  the  county  in  1832  stood 


762  for  Henry  Clay,  and  762  for  Andrew  Jackson — a 
tie  vote. 

As  yet  there  had  been  no  two  newspapers  published 
in  the  county  at  the  same  time.  The  Observer,  we 
believe,  was  quiet  on  political  questions,  but  its  suc- 
cessor— the  Clarion,  which  had  an  existence  for  two 
years  under  that  title,  during  which  time  it  was  ably 
edited  and  conducted  by  Samuel  W.  Parker,  the  sub- 
sequently distinguished  citizen  of  Connersville — was 
almost  exclusively  given  to  politics. 

The  following  is  an  extract  from  the  salutatory  of 
the  Clarion  under  date  of  May  22,  1830: 

"As  a  warrior  and  a  martial  benefactor,  we  es- 
teem Gen.  Jackson  as  second  only  to  the  Father  of 
this  country,  but  against  many  of  the  acts  of  our  Gov- 
ernment since  he  came  in  civil  power,  we  enter  an  un- 
qualified protest.  As  an  undefiled  patriot — an  able 
and  unyielding  advocate  of  the  rights  of  man,  and  the 
welfare  and  glory  of  our  common  country — we  regard 
Henry  Clay  only  as  the  younger  brother  of  Washing- 
ton, Franklin  and  Jefferson.  Believing  the  eyes  and 
the  affections  of  the  American  people  to  be  turned  up- 
on him.  to  enable  them  to  acclaim  on  the  4th  of 
March,  1833,  'Redeemed,  and  disenthralled,'  to  him, 
for  the  next  Chief  Magistrate  we  yield  a  hearty  and 
unwavering  support."     *     #     * 

Mr.  Parker  was  a  forcible  writer  and  his  labors 
were  untiring  for  the  support  of  Henry  Clay.  Other 
extracts  are  here  subjoined  from  several  issues  of  the 
Clarion.  November  12,  1831. — "We  do  not  believe 
that  Jackson  can  be  re-elected.  We  will  do  our  best 
to  expose  the  hideous  deformity  of  his  career,  and  to 
undeceive  the  blind.  If  then  he  triumphs,  the  Re- 
public can  withstand  the  battling  of  another  four 
years  tempest — the  political  heavens  will  be  the  more 
serene  when  the  warring  elements  are]  once  more 
stilled.  We  think  that  we  are  not  ignorant  of  what 
we  are  doing,  or  of  our  responsibility — -our  course  is 
right  onward." 

From  the  Clarion  May  26,  1832. — '■'■  Nos  mutamus 
et  tempora  mutantur  in  nobis — 'We  change,  and  the 
times  are  chaagod  with  us.'  'What!'  exclaims  our  old 
and  constant  readers,  '  you  have  not  'changed'  to  a 
Jacksonian,  we  hope — No!  no!  no!  dear  sirs.  A  thous- 
and leagues  further  from  it,  if  possible,  than  when 
we  made  to  you  our  first  bow,  two  years  ago.  Suffice 
it  then  to  say  that  this  number  not  only  concludes  the 
second  volume,  but  terminates  the  existence  of  the 
Clarion." 

Following  the  Clarion  was  published  the  Indiana 
Sentinel  by  Caleb  B.  Smith  and  Matthew  R.  Hull, 
which  paper  supported  Clay.  The  following  is  ex- 
tracted from  an  editorial  under  date  of  October  13, 
1832- 

"In  our  prospectus  we  pledged  ourselves  to  sup- 


HISTORY   OF  PAYETTE  COUNTY. 


port  a  syBtem  of  Internal  Improvements,  and  to  advo- 
cate the  re-chartering  of  the  United  States  Bank. 
We  believed  then  as  we  do  now,  that  those  are  meas- 
ures of  vital  importance  to  this  county,  and  that  the 
interests  of  the  people  call  in  the  most  emphathic 
terms  for  their  support.  In  order  to  sustain  those 
measures  it  is  necessary  to  support  for  the  Presidency, 
Buch  an  individual  as  will  be  favorable  to  their 
adoption.  We  would  not  support  those  measures 
without  opposing  for  the  Presidency  an  individual 
who  might  be  opposed  to  them.  It  is  for  this  reason 
that  we  have  deemed  it  our  duty  to  oppose  the  re-elec- 
tion of  Gen.  Jackson.  *  *  *  In  the  event  of 
his  reelection  that  system  of  internal  improvements 
from  which  we  have  heretofore  derived  the  most  in- 
calculable benefits,  must  be  destroyed.  The  United 
States  Bank  must  be  prostrated,  $30,000,000  must 
be  withdrawn  from  the  circulation  of  the  western 
country,  the  farmer's  pork,  his  beef,  corn,  whisky, 
plow-horses,  cattle,  and  in  fact  every  article  produced 
in  the  W^est  must  depreciate  in  value  at  least  25 
per  cent,  and  the  soui'ces  of  our  wealth  and  national 
prosperity  must  be  dried  up.  *         *         *         * 

His  attempt  to  destroy  the  bank  of  the  United  States 
must  if  it  succeeds  destroy  our  commerce,  produce 
universal  depression  in«all  our  markets,  and  render 
the  poor  and  industrious  part  of  the  community  a  prey 
to  the  extortions  of  usurers  and  shar^jers.  His  utter 
contempt  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States, 
his  disregard  of  its  decisions  and  his  declarations 
that  he  is  entirely  independent  of  its  authority,  mani- 
fest a  disposition  to  assume  arbitrary  and  unlimited 
power,  and  would  eventually,  if  contenanced  by  the 
people,  destroy  that  invaluable  institution,  which  may 
be  regarded  as  the  key-stone  of  the  arch  of  our  liber- 
ties. *  *  *  It  is  then  against  such  doctrines  and 
measures  as  these,  and  many  others  supported  by 
Gen.  Jackson,  that  we  contend." 

The  only  apology  we  offer  for  so  liberal  quota- 
tions in  this  connection,  is  the  distinguished  posi- 
tions these  editors  subsequently  occupied  in  State  and 
national  affairs. 

In  August,  1831,  the  candidates  for  Congress  in 
the  Third  District,  which  was  then  composed  of 
Rush,  Wayne,  Delaware,  Grant,  Henry,  Decatur, 
Franklin,  Dearborn,  Union,  Switzerland,  Ripley,  Ran- 
dolph, Fayette  and  Allen  Counties,  were  Gen.  Jona- 
than McCarty,  (Jackson)  Judge  John  Teat  and  Hon. 
Oliver  H.  Smith  (both  Clay),  and  the  result  was  the 
election  of  the  Jackson  candidate.  Gen.  McCarty,  by 
a  majority  of  95-1  over  Mr.  Smith,  the  second  in  the 
race.  The  vote  of  Fayette  County  was  for  McCarty 
775,  Smith  580,  and  Test  68. 

It  was  in  this  year  (1831)  that  the  first  National 
Convention  ever  assembled  in    the  United  States  met 


in  the  city  of  Baltimore,  prior  to  which  time  nomina- 
tions for  President  and  Vice-President  had  been  made 
by  members  of  Congress. 

In  the  course  of  time  the  custom  of  making  party 
nominations  for  candidates  in  States  and  counties 
became  in  vogue,  and  not  many  years  elapsed  until 
candidates  for  the  Legislature  and  other  minor  offices 
in  Fayette  were  made  in  this  way. 

The  great  campaign  of  18-10,  characterized  as  the 
hard  cider  and  log-cabin  campaign,  was  of  unusual 
interest  in  Fayette  County,  as  was  it  all  over  the 
United  States. 

The  Presidential  vote  of  the  county  this  year  by 
townships,  was:  Orange  ^Harrison,  101;  Van  Buren, 
54;  Waterloo— Harrison,  33;  Van  Buren,  91;  Colum- 
bia— Harrison,  96;  Van  Buren,  36;  Harrison — Harri- 
son, 181;  Van  Buren,  69;  Posey — Harrison,  75;  Van 
Buren,  65;  Jackson  —Harrison,  102;  Van  Buren,  101; 
Connersville— Harrison,  532;  Van  Baren,  179;  Jen 
nings^Harrison,  17;  Van  Buren,  83.  Total — Har- 
rison, 1,090;  Van  Buren,  678. 

Probably  the  greatest  political  meeting  held  in 
Fayette  County  between  1840  and  the  breaking  out 
of  the  war  of  the  Rebellion,  was  the  Republican 
rally  of  August  7,  1860.  The  crowd  was  estimated 
from  6,000  to  8,000  people.  There  was  a  grand  pro- 
cession of  about  one  mile  in  length,  composed  of  mil- 
itary and  "wide  awake''  companies,  brass  bands, 
cannons,  wagons^  bedecked  with  banners  and  flags, 
etc.,  etc.  Among  the  striking  features  of  the  parade 
were  a  blacksmith-shop  on  wheels  from  Bunker  Hill, 
in  which  John  Benedict  was  shoeing  ahorse;  a  wagon 
on  which  Andrew  Moffitt  and  John  Atherton  were 
splitting  rails;  a  car  containing  thirty-three  voters, 
each  bearing  a  red  flag  inscribed  with  the  name  of 
State;  a  Lincoln  car  gotten  up  by  the  young  men  of 
Connersville,  containing  thirty-three  young  ladies, 
and  a  wagon  in  which  the  typos  of  the  Times  office 
had  their  material,  and  were  engaged  in  setting  up 
documents  for  the  people.  The  exercises  of  the  day 
were  held  in  Claypool's  Grove;  speakers.  Col.  Lane 
and  Caleb  B.  Smith.  Thei-e  was  a  grand  torch- light 
procession  in  the  evening,  after  which  the  people 
assembled  at  the  court  house,  where  addresses  were 
delivered  by  William  Wallace,  Charles  P.  Conlon 
and  J.  D.  Farquhar. 

Below  will  be  found  the  vote  of  Fayette  County  at 
different  periods  subsequent  to  1840: 

1840 — Vote  for  Governor:  Samuel  Bigger,  1,103;

THE  first  equipment  for  printing  purposes  was 
brought  to  the  county  in  1823,  from  the  village  of 
Lebanon,  Ohio,  by  Abraham  Van  Vleet.  Mr.  Van 
Vleet  was  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  born  in  1783. 
About  the  year  1S12  he  immigrated  to  Ohio,  locating 
in  Lebanon,  where  about  the  year  1816  he  became 
connected  with  the  publication  of  the  Western  Star, 
a  paper  that  was  established  in  that  village  in  1806, 
by  John  McLean,  afterward  Justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court  of  the  United  States.  Mr.  Van  Vleet  from 
Lebanon  removed  to  Connersville,  but  at  this  time  the 
country  was  too  new  to  maintain  a  printing  establish- 
ment. [In  the  Commissioners'  proceedings  of  1824, 
reference  is  made  to  the  Indiana  Statesman  in  con- 
nection with  the  name  of  A.  Van  Vleet,  and  the  in- 
ference is  that  the  paper  was  started  by  Mr.  Van 
Vleet,  at  Connersville,  but  was  short-lived.] 

THE    FAYKTTB    OBSERVER. 

In  1826  the  Fayette  Observer  was  established  at 
Connersville  by  A.  Van  Vleet  and  Daniel  Bench.  Vol. 
I,  No.  4,  of  that  paper  bears  date  of  July  8,  1826; 
it  is  a  four-column  folio,  and  was  printed  and  pub- 
lished by  A.  Van  Vleet  for  Daniel  Rench.  At  some 
time  between  this  date  and  1829,  Mr.  Van  Vleet 
severed  his  connection  with  the  Observer.  In  1829 
the  paper  was  issued  under  the  names  of  David  Rench 
and  John  Sample,  Jr.,  which  gentlemen  published 
their  valedictory  under  date  of  May  8,  ,1830,  in  which 
it  was  stated  that  they  had  disposed  of  the  establish- 
ment to  Samuel  W.  Parker,  and  that  the  "present 
number  of  the  Fayette  Observer  will  forever  remain 
the  last." 

Samuel  W.  Parker,  who  had  located  at  Conners- 
ville as  a  school  teacher  in  1828,  began  writing  edi- 
torially for  the  Observer  early  in  1829:  "the  pro- 
prietor of  which  and  senior  editor,"  says  Mr.  Parker, 
' '  was  Daniel  Rench. "    Mr.  Parker  soon  became  editor 


in  charge,  and,  in  February,  1830,  in  a  manner  the 
proprietor  of  the  paper. 

ABRAHAM    VAN    VLEET. 

Before  proceeding  further  we  remark  that  in  1831 
Abraham  Van  Vleet  went  to  New  York  City,  where 
his  death  occurred  in  the  summer  of  1832.  From 
his  obituary  notice  is  extracted  the  following:  "  Hav- 
ing been  doomed  in  early  life  to  struggle  with  the 
relentless  hand  of  poverty,  he  had  no  means  of  culti- 
vating bis  mind  or  acquiring  knowledge,  except  by 
his  own  exertions,  at  such  times  as  he  was  able  to 
remit  his  labor  for  a  subsistence.  To  obtain  this 
laudable  object,  he  was  unremitting  in  his  endeavors, 
and  at  the  midnight  hour,  instead  of  resting  in  the 
arms  of  sleep,  after  the  labors  of  the  flay,  he  kept 
his  constant  vigil  at  the  shrine  of  knowledge  by  the 
pale  light  of  the  lamp.  Over  it  he  hovered,  until  he 
procured  a  respectable  education,  one  which  rendered 
him  useful  to  mankind,  his  country,  and  his  God. 
He  edited  a  public  journal  in  Lebanon,  Ohio,  a  num- 
ber of  years,  during  which  time  he  was  called  upon 
by  the  people  to  render  them  civil  service.  He  was 
the  author  of  several  books,  some  of  which  have  con- 
ferred a  lasting  benefit  upon  his  country."  Of  these 
we  mention  that  "  The  Ohio,  or  Western  Spelling 
Book "  is  believed  to  have  been  printed  by  Mr.  Van 
Vleet.  in  Lebanon,  about  1814.  In  1821  he  compiled 
a  work  entitled  "The  Justice  and  Township  Officer's 
Assistant,"  comprising  a  great  variety  of  judicial 
forms  and  other  necessary  precedents  for  the  use  of 
Justices  of  the  Peace,  Constables  and  township  offi- 
cers in  their  official  duties,  etc. 

THE    POLITICAL    CLARION    AND    ITS    SUCCESSOR,    THE   INDIANA 
SENTINEL. 

On  assuming  control  of  the  office  of  the  Observer, 
Mr.  Parker  purchased  new  material,  etc.,  and  sent 
forth  to  the  country  the  first  issue  of  a  new  paper,

HISTORY /OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


93 


titled  the  Political  Clarion,  May  22,  1839.  The 
Clarion  was  printed  on  a  super-royal  sheet,  and  flew 
a  lengthy  motto  from  Alexander  Hamilton,  and  was, 
in  the  full  sense  of  the  word,  a  political  paper, 
and  gave  a  hearty  and  unwavering  support  to  Henry 
Clay  for  the  Presidency.  The  editor  was  a  scholarly 
young  man  of  unusual  brilliancy,  and  the  Clarion 
was  edited  with  the  ability  that  characterized  his  sub- 
sequent life.  May  26,  1832,  appeared  the  last  num- 
ber of  the  Clarion,  which  was  succeeded  by  the  Indi- 
ana Sentinel,  the  first  number  of  which  appeared 
June  2,  1832,  edited  and  published  by  C.  B.  Smith 
and  M.  R.  Hull.  Both  were  men  of  ability  and  the 
result  was  a  spirited  paper.  It  supported  Henry  Clay 
for  President.  Mr.  Smith  withdrew  from  the  Sentinel 
May  25,  1833,  and  the  paper  was  published  for  several 
years  by  Mr.  Hull.  These  were  all  men  of  marked 
ability,  and  further  reference  is  made  to  their  lives 
and  to  these  papers  elsewhere  in  this  work. 

TEffi    WATCHMAN. 

No.  1,  Vol.  I,  of  a  paper  entitled  the  Watch- 
man made  its  appearance  in  Connersville  under  date 
of  May  31,  1834,  published  by  Van  Vleet  &amp;  Stewart, 
and  edited  by  S.  W.  Parker  and  Van  Vleet.  [In 
manuscript  left  by  Mr.  Parker,  it  is  stated  that  he 
established  the  Watchman.^  In  the  spring  of  1836 
Mr.  Stewart  withdrew  from  the  paper,  and  was  suc- 
ceeded by  John  Sample,  Jr.,  Mr.  Parker  withdrawing 
the  following  fall.  It  is  said  that  the  Watchman 
continued  an  existence  until  about  1841,  and  was 
published  in  main  by  William  Stewart. 

THE    INDIANA    TELEGRAPH. 

From  the  termination  of  the  Watchman  until  the 
establishment  of  the  Whitewater  Valley  Times  and  of 
the  Examiner  the  history  of  the  press  seems  somewhat 
mixed  and  obscure.  A  paper  titled  the  Indiana  Tel- 
egraph was  started  by  Louis  C.  Fouts  in  a  building  on 
Monroe  Street  opposite  the  court  house,  at  about  the 
period  the  Watchman  is  said  to  have  ceased  its  exist- 
ence. Its  political  complexion  is  seen  in  the  follow- 
ing extract  from  the  prospectus:  "  We  intend  un- 
compromisingly to  advocate  those  grand  cardinal 
principles  which  constitute  the  political  creed  of  the 
Democratic  Whig  party  —  the  establishment  of  a 
United  States  Bank — an  increase  of  the  tariff."  In 
December,  1841,  F.  B.  Thomas  and  W.  A.  Hotchkiss 
became  the  proprietors  of  this  paper,  and  several 
years  later  we  find  the  name  of  R.  T.  Brown  as  its 
publisher.  Between  the  years  1843  and  1845  the 
Telegraph  passed  into  the  hands  of  William  Stewart, 
and  was  conducted  by  him  for  several  years.  Through 
how  many  hands  the  paper  subsequently  passed  we 
know  not;  however,  it  is  said  that  for  a  period  Mr.  S. 


W.  Swiggett  conducted  it  and  sold  to  a  company  who 
published  it  as  a  Democratic  paper.  Subsequently 
the  paper  was  issued  by  T.  J.  White,  and  in  1859 
was  published  by  Messrs.  Higgs  &amp;  Smith,  the  for- 
mer being  the  present  publisher  of  the  Examiner. 
Mr.  Smith  soon  withdrew  and  the  paper  was  issued 
by  Mr.  Higgs  until  in  1861,  when  he  sold  to  Frank 
Brown.  This  gentleman  for  a  period  conducted  the 
paper  under  the  name  of  the  Fayette  County  Union 
(or  established  the  Union  at  the  time)  when  the  office 
was  removed  from  the  town. 

DANIEL    RENCH. 

Daniel  Rench,  who  for  quite  a  period  of  years  was 
connected  with  the  publishing  interests  of  the  county, 
was  a  native  of  Maryland,  and  about  the  year  1812 
settled  in  Jackson  Township;  was  chosen  the  first 
Auditor  of  the  county  in  1841,  filling  the  position 
some  ten  years,  and  subsequently  from  1865  to  1872 
served  as  the  Recorder  of  the  county.  His  death 
occurred  February  10,  1872,  in  the  seventy-third  year 
of  his  age.  He  had  been  a  Mason  for  fifty-three 
years. 

WILLIAM    STEWART. 

William  Stewart  was  born  in  Pennsylvania  in 
1815  and  with  his  parents  located  in  Connersville  in 
1821.  Says  his  biographer:  "  He  was  one  of  the 
oldest  printers  of  the  State."  He  served  an  appren- 
ticeship in  the  office  of  the  Observer.  He  was  en- 
gaged in  the  publication  of  papers  in  all  some  thir- 
teen years.  In  1847-48  he  served  from  this  county 
as  a  Representative  in  the  State  Legislature.  His 
death  occurred  in  February,  1865. 

THE    CHRISTIAN  CASKET. 

In  the  spring  of  1832  was  established  in  Conners- 
ville a  religious  paper  under  the  title  of  the  Chris- 
tian Casket,  a  monthly  paper  of  sixteen  pages,  by 
Elder  John  O'Kane,  who  had  with  him  as  associate 
editor.  Dr.  R.  T.  Brown.  The  Casket  was  discontin- 
ued at  the  close  of  the  first  volume. 

THE  ladies'  temperance  WREATH. 

Along  in  1854  there  was  established  in  Conners- 
ville a  paper  under  the  title  of  the  Ladies'  Temper- 
ance Wreath.  It  was  edited  by  Mrs.  Lavinia  Brown - 
lee  and  Miss  M.  Louise  Chitwood.  The  Wreath  was 
a  semi-monthly  devoted  to  temperance,  particularly 
as  it  related  to  women,  their  duties  and  responsibili- 
ties with  reference  to  the  great  reform  in  the  varjoua 
relations  of  life.  Nothing  further  of  this  paper  is 
known  to  us. 

the  connersville  times. 

We  have  been  unable  to  get  anything  definite  as 
to  the  origin  of  the  Times,  having  been  able  to  find 
no  tiles  of  the  paper  back  of  1854,   and  to  obtain

HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


nothing  satisfactory  from  the  memories  of  old  citi- 
zens consulted  on  the  subject.  No.  1,  Vol.  V,  of  the 
Connersville  Times  bears  date  of  September  21,  1854, 
published  by  J.  E.  Randall  and  W.  H.  Green.  Prior 
to  the  month  of  September,  1854,  the  paper  was  pub- 
lished by  Randall  &amp;  Maker;  that  month  the  latter' s 
interest  was  purchased  by  Mr.  Green,  and  the  name 
changed  from  the  Whitewater  Valley  Times  to  the 
name  it  has  since  borne.  With  the  issue  of  the  paper 
of  November  16,  1854,  Mr.  Randall  was  succeeded  by 
J.  H.  McClung,  and  from  that  time  until  May  15, 
1856,  the  Times  was  published  under  the  name  of 
Green  &amp;  McClung,  the  latter  retiring  with  that  issue. 
From  that  time  until  in  December,  1867,  the  Times 
was  published  and  edited  by  Mr.  Green  alone,  mak- 
ing his  connection  with  the  paper  cover  a  period  of 
over  thirteen  years;  so  long  a  time,  and  covering  an 
eventful  period  in  our  country's  history,  that  it  may 
not  be  out  of  place  to  refer  briefly  to  his  life.  He 
was  born  in  Clark  County,  this  State,  in  1814;  was 
apprenticed  to  the  printer's  trade  in  the  oflSce  of  the 
New  Albany  Gazette  at  the  age  of  sixteen  years;  in 
1838  he  became  a  partner  in  the  publication  of  that 
paper,  with  which  he  remained  connected  until  1845 
(the  first  daily  paper  in  the  State).  In  1847  he 
established  the  Crawford  County  Whig  at  Leaven- 
worth, Ind. ;  in  1 849  he  was  connected  with  the  New 
Albany  Bulletin.  From  1867  to  1875  he  served  as 
Auditor  of  Fayette  County.  He  is  now  publishing 
the  Brookville  American. 

In  December,  1867,  the  paper  and  office  of  the 
Connersville  Times  was  purchased  by  A.  M.  Sinks. 
That  same  winter  G.  M.  Sinks,  a  brother,  became  a 
partner,  and  the  Times  was  published  until  in  1870 
by  A.  M.  &amp;  G.  M.  Sinks.  In  1870  another  brother, 
M.  R.  Sinks,  became  a  third  owner  of  the  paper. 
May  1,  1871,  A.  M.  Sinks  sold  his  interest  in  the 
office  to  G.  M.  &amp;  M.  R.  Sinks,  who  published  the 
Times  until  in  1873,  when  M.  R.  sold  to  G.  M.  July 
1,  1875,  the  paper  passed  from  G.  M.  Sinks  into  the 
hands  of  John  A.  James  and  W.  F.  Downs.  These 
gentlemen  were  the  proprietors  of  the  paper  until  in 
August,  1877,  when  Mr.  Downs  sold  his  interest  to 
Charles  N.  Sinks.  One  year  later  Mr.  James  sold 
his  interest  to  Mr.  Sinks,  who  became  the  sole  pro- 
prietor, and  published  the  paper  until  in  September, 
1880,  when  the  office  was  purchased  by  John  C. 
Ochiltree  and  W.  F.  Downs.  In  March,  1881,  these 
gentlemen  consolidated  the  Times  with  the  News, 
then  published  by  McClung  &amp;  Bacon,  and  the  paper 
was  issued  under  the  title  of  the  Connersville  Times 
and  News.  In  August,  1881,  Mr.  Ochiltree  disposed 
of  his  interest  in  the  office  to  McClung,  Bacon  &amp; 
Downs,  and  on  the  9th  of  November  following  the 
entire  business  was  purchased  by  A.  M.  Sinks  and  J.  C. 


Ochiltree.  The  Neivs  portion  of  the  title  was 
dropped  in  October,  1881.  From  November,  1881, 
until  July  1,  1884,  the  Times  and  business  of  the  office 
was  carried  on  by  these  gentlemen,  under  whose 
management  the  Times  has  been  judiciously  con 
ducted  and  wisely  edited,  ever  advocating  such  meas- 
ures as  are  ennobling  to  man,  and  to  the  best  inter- 
ests of  the  public  generally,  which  are  in  the  line  of 
progress  and  advancement.  Both  men  of  strong 
political  convictions,  the  Times  has  not  been  silent  on 
the  political  questions  of  the  day,  but  is  ever  on  the 
alert  in  the  furtherance  of  the  principles  of  the  Re- 
publican party.  With  the  issue  of  the  paper  of  July  2, 
1884,  Mr.  Ochiltree,  the  junior  editor,  retired,  leaving 
Mr.  Sinks  the  sole  proprietor  and  editor.  Mr.  Sinks 
is  well  fitted  for  the  editorial  chair,  being  a  scholarly 
gentleman  and  a  man  of  legal  attainments,  and  of  long 
years'  experience  in  that  profession.  Biographies  of 
these  gentlemen  appear  elsewhere  in  this  work.  It 
is  claimed  for  the  Times  that  it  is  the  lineal  successor 
of  the  old  Fayette  Observer,  whose  history  is  given 
previously.  The  office  of  the  Times  is  well  equipped 
with  modern  facilities  for  the  execution  of  tirst-class 
job  printing.  The  paper  is  a  neat  six-column  quarto, 
30x44  inches,  issued  on  Wednesday  of  each  week, 
and  is  the  Republican  organ  of  the  county. 

THE  CONNERSVILLE  EXAMINEE. 

The  Connersville  Examiner  was  established  at 
Connersville  in  the  year  1867,  the  first  issue  appear- 
ing on  Tuesday,  December  24th,  of  that  year.  It 
was  a  neat  six-column  folio  published  by  J.  M. 
Higgs  and  F.  M.  Pickett.  In  a  lengthy  and  well 
written  salutatory  was  fully  set  forth  the  mission  of 
the  journal.  The  men  at  the  helm  believed  that  the 
safety  of  the  Government  depended  upon  the  success- 
ful carrying  out  of  old  fashioned  Democratic  princi- 
ples, which  they  meant  to  advocate  to  the  best  of 
their  ability.  The  paper  was  to  be  directed  in  oppo- 
sition to  the  then  system  of  taxation;  it  was  opposed 
to  the  national  bank  system  and  believed  that  the 
national  debt  should  be  paid  in  the  same  currency 
in  which  it  was  contracted — greenbacks.  Comment- 
ing on  the  paper,  said  the  Brookville  Democrat,  "We 
are  in  receipt  of  the  first  number  of  a,  new  Demo- 
cratic paper  titled  the  Connersville  Examiner,  pub- 
lished at  our  neighboring  town  of  Connersville  by 
Messrs.  J.  M.  Higgs  and  F.  M.  Pickett.  The  Exam- 
iner is  very  neat  in  its  'make  up'  and  its  general 
appearance  indicates  good  workmanship.  Its  edito- 
rials are  spicy  and  pointed,  and  are  evidently  writ- 
ten by  one  who  is  no  stranger  to  editorial  life.  *  ^ 
*  Mr.  Pickett  was  formerly  one  of  the  local 
editors  of  the  Indianapolis  Herald  and  is  an  able 
writer."

The  Examiner  was  enlarged  to  a  seven-column 
paper  with  the  issue  of  June  23,  1868,  and  continued 
to  be  published  under  the  firm  name  given  above 
until  March  17,  1869,  when  Mr.  Pickett  withdrew, 
leaving  Mr.  Higgs  the  sole  proprietor  and  editor. 
From  time  to  time  since  the  paper  was  launched  upon 
its  voyage,  it  has  steadily  grown  until  to-day  it  is  a 
nine-column  folio  ranking  with  the  largest  county 
papers  in  the  State.  On  New  Year's  Day,  1882,  it 
appeared  in  a  new  dress  and  on  May  17  following, 
assumed  its  present  proportions.  In  the  beginning 
the  materials  of  the  office  were  limited  and  of  prim- 
itive design,  since  which  time  these  have  been 
replaced  by  the  most  modern  type  and  machinery 
until  now  the  office  is  well  equipped  for  the  execu- 
tion of  first  class  job  printing.  Mr.  Siggs,  the  pro- 
prietor and  editor  in  chief  is  a  practical  printer, 
having  served  an  apprenticeship  in  the  village  of 
Brookville,  Ind.,  and  is  well  qualified  for  journalism, 
which  for  upward  of  eighteen  years  he  has  pursued 
among  the  same  people,  and  it  is  to  his  credit  to  say 
that  during  that  long  period  his  labors  through  the 
columns  of  the  Examiner  in  the  advocacy  of  such 
measures  as  have  tended  to  build  up  the  city  have 
not  been  without  results;  and  that  the  interests  of 
his  party  have  not  suffered  at  his  hands.  His  biog- 
raphy will  be  found  elsewhere  in  this  work.  The 
Examiner  has  kept  pace  with  the  progress  of  the 
age  and   advocated  what  was  believed  to  be  for  the 


best  interests  of  the  people  of  the  county.  In  an 
editorial  on  the  beginning  of  its  seventeenth  year 
was  stated  that  "the  Examiner  in  future  will  con- 
tinue to  be  Democratic  to  the  core,  but  will  only 
bind  itself  to  support  men  of  honesty,  sobriety  and 
superior  qualifications."         *         *         *  * 

The  paper  is  the  Democratic  organ  of  Fayette 
County  and  is  published  every  Wednesday. 

THE    CONNEBSVILLE    NEWS. 

In  1877  a  paper  bearing  the  above  name  was 
established  at  Connersville,  by  E.  J.  Smith,  who  was 
its  proprietor  and  editor  in  chief.  The  first  number 
of  the  News  was  issued  June  7.  It  was  a  six-column 
folio  and  flew  the  motto  "A  truly  Independent  Jour- 
nal— Fearless  in  its  Advocacy."  The  News  printed  a 
German  column,  the  first  ever  published  in  the  county. 
Under  date  of  August  7,  1 878,  the  News  appeared  a 
seven-column  folio,  Republican  in  politics,  having 
dropped  the  motto,  and  was  under  the  proprietorship 
of  T.  A.  Taylor  and  E.  B.  Rawles.  With  the  issue 
of  February  26,  1879,  Mr.  Taylor  appeared  as  the 
sole  publisher  of  the  paper,  and  under  date  of 
November  12,  1879,  the  proprietors  were  W.  H. 
Green  and  G.  C.  Bacon.  Subsequently  the  News 
passed  into  the  hands  of  McClung  &amp;  Bacon,  who  in 
March,  1881,  with  John  C.  Ochiltree  and  W.  F. 
Downs,  then  proprietors  of  the  Times,  consolidated 
the  two  papers.

CHAPTER  XIII. 


THE  BENCH  AND  THE  BAR. 

CIRCUITS  AND    JUDGES— EARLY    PROSECUTING     ATTORNEYS— FIRST     AND     LATER    LAWYERS     AT    THE     FAYETTE 
COURTS— REFERANCE  TO  THE  LAWYERS  AND  PRACTICE  OF  EARLY  INDIANA— RESIDENT  LAWYERS. 


IN  reviewing  the  history  of  the  bench  and  the  bar, 
we  have  to  reach  out  beyond  county  limits.  At 
the  organization  of  the  county,  the  Judge  traveled 
the  "Whitewater  country,  extending  from  the  Ohio  on 
the  south  to  the  State  of  Michigan  on  the  north,  and 
from  the  Ohio  line  on  the  east  to  "White  River  on  the 
west,  a  territory  probably  200x70  miles.  Many  of 
the  early  lawyers  practiced  in  the  courts  of  the  entire 
region. 


A  glance  at  the  Whitewater  bar  reveals  the  names 
of  an  able  array  of  men — men  who  shone  as  bright 
lights  in  the  Senate  of  the  United  States,  in  the  Lower 
House,  iu  the  Cabinet,  in  the  Gubernatorial  chair 
in  the  Supreme  Court,  on  the  field  of  battle,  and  in 
other  high  official  positions. 

With  the  meager  data  at  our  command,  and  lim- 
ited space,  we  can  only  hope  to  present  some  facts 
connected   with    the    legal    profession    of    Fayette 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY.

County,  and  with  the  circuits  of  which  it  has  in  the 
past  formed  a  part,  not  elsewhere  recorded.  This  we 
shall  endeavor  to  do  with  some  regard  to  chronolog- 
ical order.  Biographies  of  some  of  the  most  dis- 
tinguished resident  members  of  the  legal  profession 
will  be  found  elsewhere  in  this  work. 

The  legal  business  of  the  earliest  pioneers  of 
the  county  for  a  decade  after  its  first  settlement  was 
transacted  at  the  seat  of  justice  of  the  territory  of 
which  they  formed  a  part — Lawreaceburg,  and  later 
Brookville,  Salisbury  and  Centerville — owing  to  the 
location  of  their  lands  and  the  time  of  their  bus- 
iness prior  to  the  organization  of  Fayette  County. 

CIRCUITS     AND    JUDGES. 

After  the  organization  of  the  county  it  was  placed 
in  the  Third  Judicial  Circuit,  with  which  it  remained 
until  the  spring  term  of  1830.  The  President  Judges 
of  the  Third  Circuit  during  that  period  were  John 
Watts,  who  served  until  the  March  term,  1S20,  when 
succeeded  by  Miles  C.  Eggleston,  who  served  until 
the  March  term  of  court,  1830. 

At  the  March  term,  1830,  Fayette  County  became 
a  part  of  the  Sixth  Judicial  Circuit,  over  which  pre- 
sided Charles  H.  Test,  whose  successor  in  the  spring 
of  1836  was  Samuel  Bigger.  Judge  James  Perry  was 
Bigger's  successor  by  appointment,  commissioned 
March  29,  1840;  the  latter  resigned  and  became  Gov- 
ernor. Judge  Perry  served  out  the  unexpired  time 
of  Judge  Bigger,  and  was  succeeded  by  Jehu  T.  Elli- 
ott, who  first  appeared  at  the  spring  term  of  the  court 
184:4.  Judge  Elliott  discharged  the  duties  of  the 
ofiSce  until  1852,  when  he  was  relieved  at  the  spring 
term  of  that  year  by  the  late  Oliver  P.  Morton. 

The  following  year  Fayette  County  w3s  made  a 
part  of  the  Fourth  Judicial  Circuit,  and  at  the  spring 
term  William  M.  McCarty,  President  Judge  of  that 
circuit,  presided  at  Fayette  County.  That  fall  Judge 
McCarty  was  succeeded  by  Judge  Reuben  D.  Logan, 
who  served  through  the  September  term  of  coiu-t,  1865. 
He  was  succeeded  at  the  March  term,  1866,  by  Jere- 
miah M.  Wilson.  At  the  March  term  of  court,  1871, 
William  A.  Cullen  became  successor  to  Judge  Wilson. 

At  the  spring  term  of  court,  1873,  the  county 
appears  in  the  Eighth  Judicial  Circuit,  over  which 
presided  Samuel  A.  Bonner.  In  1883  Fayette  was 
made  a  part  of  the  Thirty-seventh  Judicial  Circuit, 
over  which  presided  Ferdinand  S.  Swift,  who  is  the 
present  Judge  of  the  Fayette  Circuit  Court. 

The  first  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  of 
Fayette  County  was  John  S.  Eeid,  whose  name 
appears  for  the  first  time  at  the  January  term  of  the 
court,  1853.  Mi-.  Reid  ^discharged  the  duties  of  this 
oflSce  until  the  December  term  of  court,  1860,  when 
he  w.as  succeeded  by  Jeremiah  M.  Wilson,  who  served 


'  until  the  spring  term  of  court,  1865,  then  was  suo- 
I  ceeded  by  John  F.  Kibby,  who  performed  the  duties 
of  the  bench  until  1873,  when  the  Court  of  Common 
Pleas  was  abolished. 

The  resident  Judges  of  the  county  have  been  John 
I  S.  Reid  and  Jeremiah  M.  Wilson. 

The  former  was  a  native  of  Scotland,  and  before 
twenty- four  years  of  age  had  pursued  a  course  of 
study  at  Oxford  University.  In  1839  he  immigrated 
to  America  and  attended  Miami  University  at  Oxford, 
Ohio.  After  his  graduation  he  taught  some  in  that 
vicinity,  and  in  1840  removed  to  Liberty,  where  he 
also  taught  school  and  read  law.  In  1851  he  settled 
in  Connersville,  and  was  soon  afterward  elected  Judge 
of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  serving  from  1853  to 
1860.  He  was  a  member  of  the  State  Constitutional 
Convention,  and  subsequently  served  as  State  Senator 
from  the  counties  of  Fayette  and  Union.  In  1868 
he  was  the  Democratic  nominee  for  Concrress  against 
George  W.  Julian.  Reid's  friends  claimed  his  elec- 
tion, and  the  Judge  contested  the  election,  but  unsuc- 
cessfully. In  1876  he  removed  to  Indianapolis,  where 
he  was  engaged  in  the  practice  of  law  until  his  death, 
which  occurred  September  5,  1879.  He  was  a  man 
of  decided  ability  and  sterling  character.  He  had  a 
taste  for  literary  pursuits  and  was  a  poet  of  some 
distinction.      He  published  a  volume  of  works. 

Judge  Wilson  is  a  native  of  Warren  County, 
Ohio,  where  his  youth  was  passed  on  a  farm.  He 
read  law  at  Lebanon,  the  county  seat  of  Warren,  with 
Gen.  Durbin  Ward,  and  located  at  Centerville  about 
1854,  and  a  few  years  subsequently  settled  at  Con- 
nersville. From  1860  to  1865  he  served  as.  Common 
Pleas  Judge  and  as  Circuit  Judge  from  1866  to  1871. 
He  represented  his  district  in  Congress  from  1871  to 
1875,  after  which  he  settled  in  Washington,  D.  C, 
where  he  has  since  been  engaged  in  the  active 
practice  of  his  profession.  He  is  a  man  of  recognized 
ability. 

EAKLT  PROSECUTING  ATTORNEYS. 

The  attorney  who  prosecuted  pleas  in  behalf  of 
the  State  for  the  circuit  was  appointed  by  the  Gov- 
ernor, and  in  the  early  history  of  the  courts  of 
Fayette  County  the  sum  of  $20  was  the  usual  allow- 
ance for  the  services  of  a  Prosecuting  Attorney  at  a 
single  term.  It  was  necessary  at  times  for  the 
appointment  of  a  County  Prosecutor,  which  was 
made  by  the  Judge. 

In  naming  some  of  the  men  who  served  in  the 
capacity  of  Prosecuting  Attorney  for  the  circuit  or 
county  in  its  early  history,  where  either  can  be 
designated  with  a  degree  of  certainty,  it  will  be  done. 

The  first  to  serve  as  County  Prosecutor  was  Will- 
iam W.  Wicks,  who  was  appointed  on  the  first  day  of 
the  first  term  of  court  held   in  the  county.   May  3,

HISTORY  OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


1819.  Oliver  H.  Smith  was  appointed  County  Pros- 
ecutor in  1822,  and  took  the  oath  of  office  at  the 
March  term  of  that  year.  In  1824  he  was  appointed 
Circuit  Prosecutor  by  Gov.  Hendricks,  which  position 
he  held  two  years,  resigning  in  182(5,  during  which 
time,  he  remarks:  "  I  rode  with  Judge Eggleston  into 
every  county  and  attended  the  courts  twice  a  year. 
Our  southern  court  at  that  time  was  held  at  Vevay, 
and  our  northern  at  Fort  Wayne.  The  Judge  was 
rather  delicate,  but  I  had  an  iron  constitution.  There 
were  no  bridges  over  the  streams,  but  we  rode  good 
swimming  horses  and  never  faltered  on  account  of 
high  water,  but  plunged  in  and  always  found  the 
opposite  shore  somehow.  During  the  two  years  that 
I  served  as  Prosecutor,  there  was  not  a  single  court 
held  or  a  grand  jury  impaneled  in  my  absence  on 
our  circuit.  On  one  circuit  I  heard  nine  men  sen- 
tenced to  the  penitentiary  and  four  to  be  hung  that  I 
prosecuted." 

Mr.  Smith's  successor  was  Amos  Lane,  when 
served  for  a  time  Cyrus  Finch  and  David  Wallace, 
then  from  December  30,  1828,  for  a  period  of  three 
years  was  appointed  Prosecuting  Attorney  for  the 
Circuit  Martin  M.  Ray.  James  Perry,  William  J. 
Brown  (circuit),  Samuel  W.  Parker,  David  Macy, 
Martin  M.  Ray,  Samuel  E.  Perkins  and  Jehu  T. 
Elliott  served  in  the  order  given. 

FIKST    AND    LATER    LAWYERS  AT  THE    FAYETTE    COURTS. 

At  the  opening  of  the  court,  May  3,  1819,  the

REFERENCE  TO  THE   LAWYERS  AND  PRACTrCE  OF   EARLY 
INDIANA. 

Oliver  H.  Smith,  in  speaking  of  the  lawyers  of 
early  Indiana,  says:  "Our  lawyers  were  what  the 
world  calls  self-made  men,  meaning  men  who  have 
not  had  the  advantages  of  rich  fathers  and  early  edu- 
cation, to  whom  the  higher  seminaries  and  colleges 
were  sealed  books;  men  gifted  by  nature  with 
strong,  vigorous,  clear  intellects,  fine  health,  and 
sound  constitutions;  men,  who  like  the  newly- 
hatched  swan,  were  directed  by  nature  to  their  proper 
elements,  their  proper  professions.  Few  of  them 
failed  of  success.  Necessity  urged  to  action.  With 
most  of  them  it  was  'root  or  die.'  In  ninety-nine 
cases  out  of  every  hundred  of  the  failures  in  the  dif- 
ferent professions  and  avocations  in  life,  charged  by 
the  world  to  'bad  luck,'  it  is  nothing  more  nor  less 
than  the  selection  of  a  profession,  avocation  or  busi- 
ness that  nature  never  intended  you  for.  The  smallest 
teal,  or  duck,  that  swims  on  the  bosom  of  Chesa- 
peake Bay,  would  sink  and  drown  in  that  element  the 
best  blooded  and  finest  game-cock  that  ever  old  Vir- 
ginia produced  in  her  most  chivalric  days;  while  in 
the  cock-pit,  the  teal  or  duck  would  be  nowhere  in 
the  fight. 

"Our  counties  furnished  too  little  business  for  the 
resident  attorneys;  we  all  looked  to  a  circuit  prac- 
tice. Some  rode  the  whole  circuit  and  others  over 
but  few  counties.  We  sometimes  had  a  little  spar- 
ring in  our  cases  in  trials,  but  it  ended  there,  and  we 
stood  banded  together  like  brothers.  At  the  Rush 
Circuit  Court  my  friend  Judge  Perry  bargained  for  a 
pony  for  $25,  to  be  delivered  the  next  day,  on  a 
credit  of  six  months.     The  man  came  with  the  pony.

but  required  security  of  the  Judge  for  the  $25.  The 
Judge  drew  the  note  at  the  top  of  a  sheet  of  foolscap, 
and  signed  it.  I  signed  it;  James  Rariden  signed  it 
and  passed  it  on,  and  on  it  went  from  lawyer  to  lawyer 
around  the  bar,  till  some  twenty  of  us  had  signed  it. 
I  then  handed  it  up  to  the  Court,  and  the  three  Judges 
put  their  names  to  it.  Judge  Perry  presented  it  to 
the  man  he  had  bought  the  pony  of,  but  he  promptly 
refused  to  receive  it.  'Do  you  think  I  am  a  fool,  to 
let  you  get  the  court  and  all  the  lawyers  on  your 
side?  I  see  you  intend  to  cheat  me  out  of  my  pony.' 
Up  he  jumped  and  ran  out  of  the  court  house  on  full 
gallop. 

"  The  great  variety  of  trials  and  incidents  on  the 
circuit  gave  to  the  life  of  a  traveling  attorney  an 
interest  that  we  all  relished  exceedingly.  There  was 
none  of  the  Green  Bay  City  monotony,  no  dyspepsia, 
no  gout,  no  ennui,  rheumatism  or  neuralgia;  con- 
sumption was  a  stranger  among  us.  An  occasional 
jump  of  the  toothache,  relieved  by  the  turnkey  of  the 
first  doctor  we  came  to,  was  the  worst.  All  was  fun, 
good  humor,  fine  jokes  well  received,  good  appetites 
and  sound  sleeping,  cheerful  landlords  and  good- 
natured  landladies  at  the  head  oi  the  table.  We 
rode  first-class  horses:  Gen.  Noble  oq  'Wrangler,'  for 
which  he  gave  $60;  Drew  on  'Drew  Gray,'  cost 
$70;  Caswell  on  'Blue  Dick,'  cost  $65;  Rariden 
on  'Old  Gray,'  cost  $80;  John  Test  on  'Bay 
Filly,'  cost  $50;  Gen.  McKinney  on  'McKinney 
Roan,'  cost  $45;  David  Wallace  on  'Ball,'  cost  $40; 
Amos  Lane  on  'Big  Sorrel,'  cost  $60;  Judge  Eggles- 
ton  on  Indian  pony,  cost  $35;  George  H.  Dunn  on 
'Dancing  Rabbit,'  cost  $40;  James  B.  Ray  on  'Red 
Jacket,'  cost  $60;  Martin  M.  Ray  on  'John,'  cost 
$35;  William  R.  Morris  on  'Jacob,'  cost  $50;  Charles 
H.  Test  on  'Archie,'  cost  $40;  John  S.  Newman  on 
'Clay  Bank,'  cost  $60;  and  I  rode  'Grey  Fox,'  that 
cost  me  $90.  These  were  the  highest  priceg  at  that 
day  for  the  very  best  traveling  horses  in  the  country. 
They  were  trained  to  the  cross-pole  mud  roads,  and 
to  swimming. 

"Oar  attorneys  were  ready,  ofif-hand  practitioners, 
seldom  at  fault  for  the  occasion.  Sometimes  we  had 
to  meet  attorneys  from  other  States,  who  would 
fling  the  Latin  and  technical  terms  with  a  triumph- 
ant air,  but  in  most  cases  they  were  foiled  by  the 
quick  retorts  of  our  bar." 

Below  is  set  forth  the  character  of  some  of  the 
non-resident  members  of  the  early  Whitewater  bar, 
as  held  by  Oliver  H.  Smith,  some  of  whom  sat  upon 
the  bench  in  this  county,  and  others  were  at  times 
associated  in  its  legal  business.  (James  B.  Ray  was 
for  a  short  time  a  resident  of  Connersville,  and 
served  for  a  time  as  Deputy  Clerk  of  the  County.) 

"Gen.  Noble  was  emphatically  a  self-made  man  ; 


quick,  ready  and  always  prepared.  He  served  two 
full  terms  in  the  Senate;  died  a  Senator,  compar- 
atively a  young  man,  and  lies  entombed  in  the  Con- 
gressional Cemetery  at  Washington. 

"James  B.  Ray  succeeded  Gov.  Hendricks,  and 
was  the  youngest  man  who  ever  occupied  the  chair  at 
the  time  of  his  election.  He  was  a  popular  itump 
speaker;  was  never  beaten  before  the  people  for  Gov- 
ernor, at  one  time  beating  Judge  Blackford,  at 
another.  Dr.  Israel  T.  Canby  and  Habin  H.  Moore. 
He  was  a  zealous  lawyer,  but  entered  the  political 
field  before  his  forensic  powers  were  fully  developed. 

"Gen.  McKinney  was  a  fair  lawyer,  and  gave 
good  satisfaction  as  a  Judge,  but  died  before  he  had 
reached  the  meridian  of  his  life,  or  had  been  long 
enough  on  the  bench  to  fully  develop  his  judicial 
character. 

'  'Among  the  prominent  men  of  the  early  White  - 
water  bar  was  Judge  Charles  H.  Test.  He  was  a 
young  man  of  fine  talents  and  great  energy  of  charac- 
ter. At  quite  an  early  age  he  took  a  high  position 
among  the  ablest  of  the  profession. 

"James  Rariden  was  one  of  the  strong  men  of 
the  State.  He  represented  Wayne  County  many  years 
in  both  branches  of  the  General  Assembly;  was  a 
member  of  the  Constitutional  Convention  of  1850,  and 
served  two  terms  in  Congress  from  his  district. 

"William  J.  Brown  held  the  high  offices  of  mem 
ber  of  the  Legislature,  member  of  Congress  and 
Assistant  Postmaster-General.  For  many  years  be 
was  one  of  the  most  formidable  Democratic  public 
speakers  in  the  State. 

"John  S.  Newman  was  a  fine  practice  lawyer  with 
a  head  clear  as  a  bell,  a  remarkably  matured  judg- 
ment at  an  early  day  in  his  profession.  His  strong 
vigorous  intellect  made  him  a  safe  counsellor  and  a 
valuable  co-laborer  in  heavy  cases." 

RESIDENT    LAWYERS. 

Oliver  H.  Smith  was  admitted  to  the  bar  at  Law- 
renceburg,  this  State,  in  March,  1820,  aad  in  May  of 
the  same  year  settled  in  Connersville  as  a  practitioner. 
At  the  time  of  his  arrival  there  was  but  one  lawyer  in 
the  village — William  W.  Wick.  Mr.  Wick  was  not 
long  a  resident  practitioner,  as  he  was  soon  elected  a 
Judge  of  the  "New  Purchase,"  and  from  1825  to 
1829  he  filled  the  office  of  Secretary  of  State,  and 
subsequently  served  as  a  Member  of  Congress. 
Charles  Veeder,  Ozias  Hall,  Cyrus  Finch  and  Martin 
M.  Ray  were  among  the  early  resident  members  of 
the  bar. 

Caleb  B.  Smith  commenced  the  practice  of  law  at 
Connersville  in  the  fall  of  1828;  and  Samuel  W. 
Parker  at  Connersville  in  1831. 

Samuel  C.  Sample  began  the  study  of  law  at  Con-

nersville  with  Oliver  H.  Smith  in  1820.  "  Mr.  Sam- 
ple was  no  ordinary  man,  plain,  practical  in  all  his 
acts.  He  represented  his  district  in  Congress  with 
decided  ability;  was  always  at  his  post,  among  the 
working  men  of  the  body.  At  the  bar  and  as  Presid- 
ing Judge  of  the  Circuit  Courts  he  stood  high  among 
the  most  eflScient  and  able  practitioners,  and  one  of 
the  purest  Judges  that  has  graced  the  bench."  He 
died  while  serving  as  President  of  the  State  Bank  at 
South  Bend,  Ind. 

James  C.  Mcintosh  read  law  under  Samuel  W. 
Parker  and  was  admitted  to  practice  in  1851. 

The  resident  lawyers  of  the  county  at  Conners- 
ville  in  1832  were  Oliver  H.  Smith,  Caleb  B.  Smith, 
Samuel  W.  Parker  and  Samuel  C.  Sample.  William 
Dail^'  was  at  this  time  practicing  law,  and  resided 
five  and  a  half  miles  southwest  of  the  village. 

For  a  period  at  this  time  and  just  prior  thereto 
the  following  law  firms  existed:  M.  M.  Ray,  and  C. 
B.  Smith  (in  1833  Ray  was  located  at  Centreville), 
James  Rariden  and  S.  W.  Parker.  The  former's 
oflBee  was  at  Centreville. 

From  a  published  article  in  1846  we  give  the 
names  of  the  attorneys  as  therein  set  forth:  Caleb  B. 
Smith,  S.  W.  Parker,  Elisha  Vance,  James  A.  Fay, 
Joseph  Justice,  Lewis  C.  Fonts,  William  L.  Spooner 
and  William  Daily. 

The  resident  attorneys  of  the  county  for  1858-59 
(as  given  in  a  State  Directory)  were  B.  F.  Claypool, 
James  C.  Mcintosh,  Joseph  Marshall,  Samuel  W. 
Parker,  John  S.  Reid,  Gilbert  Trusler,  Nelson  Trusler 
and  Elisha  Vance. 

Nelson    Trusler    was   born  in  Franklin  County, 


Ind.,  in  1823,  read  law  with  John  A.  Matson,  in 
Brookville,  and  began  the  practice  in  Fayette  County. 
In  an  obituary  notice  it  is  stated  that  "  he  soon  took 
a  leading  position  in  the  Whitewater  Valley  bar,  at 
that  time  the  ranking  bar  of  the  State,  and  meeting 
such  men  as  Parker  and  Caleb  B.  Smith  with  credit." 
He  was  elected  to  the  State  Legislature  in  1855. 
From  September,  1862,  to  October,  1863,  Mr.  Trusler 
served  as  Colonel  of  the  Eighty-fourth  Regiment 
Indiana  Volunteers:  from  1865  to  1869  he  served  as 
Secretary  of  State.  He  was  defeated  for  Attorney- 
General  in  1870,  and  in  1872  succeeded  Thomas  M. 
Browne  as  United  States  District  Attorney.  On  being 
elected  Secretary  of  State  he  removed  to  Indianapo- 
lis, where  his  death  occurred  in  1880. 

Gilbert  Trusler,  a  brother  of  Nelson,  was  a  native 
of  this  county,  born  in  1830.  His  name  first  appeared 
as  an  attorney  at  the  bar  of  Fayette  County  in  1851. 
He  entered  the  army  in  1861  as  Captain  of  Company 
H,  Thirty-sixth  Regiment  Indiana  Volunteers,  and  in 
June,  1863,  was  commissioned  Major  of  the  regiment. 
At  the  close  of  the  war  he  was  elected  to  the  State 
Legislature.  In  his  obituary  notice  it  was  stated 
that  "  he  was  a  man  of  rare  intellect,  keen  percep- 
tions and  sound  judgment." 

B.  F.  Claypool,  the  oldest  and  most  distinguished 
member  of  the  bar  of  the  county,  now  engaged  in 
active  practice,  read  law  in  the  office  of  the  late  Hon. 
Oliver  H.  Smith,  in  Indianapolis,  being  admitted  in 
1847,  and  soon  thereafter  established  himself  in  the 
practice  at  Connersville,  his  native  city.  His  biog- 
raphy, with  those  of  other  living  attorneys,  is  found 
elsewhere  in  this  work.

THE  MEDICAL    PROFESSION.

THE  FIRST  PHYSICIANS— DISTRICT  MEDICAL  SOCIETIES— EARLY  CHARGES   FOR   MEDICAL  SERVICES— LATER  PHY- 
SICIANS— FAYETTE  COUNTY  MEDICAL  SOCIETY  AND  THE  PROFESSION. 


/~\WING  to  a  variety  of  causes,  we  have  found  it  a 
^-^  task  of  no  small  proportions  to  construct  a  his- 
tory of  the  medical  profession  and  society  of  Fayette 
County,  Ind.,  particularly  that  part  relating  to  its 
first  organization  and  incipient  progress.  Chief 
among  these  causes  are  the  absence  of  authoritative 
data,  the  death  or  removal  of  the  pioneers  of  the 
profession,  and  the  imperfect  state  of  organization 
in  the  practice  among  the  settlements.  We  note, 
however,  with  a  degree  of  professional  pride,  the 
comparative  progress  made  by  the  plucky  and  per- 
sistent little  handful   of  "  regulars  "  who  first  came 


to  this  valley,  to  mold  themselves  into  a  society,  with 
the  two-fold  purpose  of  mutual  improvement  and  of 
securing  the  "code"  against  imposture,  the  latter 
instinct  resembling  that  of  their  fellow  settlers, 
inasmuch  as  their  first  measure  was  one  of  prudence 
and  mutual  self-protection,  in  order  that  that  which 
was  to  follow — progress  and  achievement — might  be 
insured  against  a  double  peril,  that  of  foes  without 
and  apathy  within. 

THE    FIRST    PHYSICIANS. 

Among  the  earliest  physicians  of  whom  we  have 
any  knowledge,  who  settled  within  the  present  limits 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY.

of  the  county,  were  Drs.  John  Bradburn,  James 
Thomas,  Joseph  Moffitt,  Temple  E.  Gayle,  and  Joseph 
S.  Burr. 

Dr.  Bradburn  was  a  native  of  Lancaster  County 
Penn.,  and  as  early  as  1814  settled  within  the  present 
limits  of  Fayette  County  in  the  vicinity  of  what  is 
now  known  as  Harrisburg.  Hon.  Oliver  H.  Smith  in 
his  "Early  Indiana"  refers  to  him  as  "an  eminent 
surgeon,  a  man  of  great  muscular  powers,  and  of  the 
most  indomitable  personal  courage."  The  Doctor's 
experience  as  a  practitioner  in  this  county  was  marred 
by  a  fearful  tragedy  in  which  he  became  instrumental 
in  the  death  of  two  young  men,  in  the  spring  of  1825, 
an  account  of  which  is  given  elsewhere  in  this  work. 
Shortly  after  the  tragedy,  Dr.  Bradburn  removed 
from  this  county  to  the  southern  part  of  the  State, 
subsequently  to  the  vicinity  of  Brookville,  where  he 
died  in  the  early  part  of  the  decade  between  1830 
and  1840.  He  is  said  to  have  been  a  regular  graduate 
and  a  man  highly  respected.  At  the  time  of  the 
tragedy  above  referred  to,  he  was  about  thirty  years 
of  age,  "possessed,"  it  is  said,  "  of  a  stern  counte- 
nance, an  inflexible  will,  and  great  executive  ability." 

Dr.  Thomas  was  a  native  of  New  York  State,  and 
was  one  of  the  colony  of  immigrants  that  settled  in 
the  vicinity  of  Harrisburg,  this  county,  in  1819,  and 
formed  what  was  designated  as  the  "Yankee  Settle- 
ment.'' He  was  a  regular  graduate,  and  for  years  en- 
joyed a  successful  and  lucrative  practice  at  Harrisburg. 

About  the  year  1820,  Dr.  Joseph  Moffitt,  a  native 
of  New  Haven,  Conn.,  and  a  well-trained  student 
fresh  from  Yale  College,  settled  in  Connersville.  He 
died  in  1833. 

About  this  time,  Dr.  Burr  and  Dr.  Gayle  came  to 
Connersville  and  began  the  practice  of  medicine. 
Concerning  Dr.  Burr's  advent  into  the  village,  Hon. 
Oliver  H.  Smith  says:  "  One  morning  I  was  introduced 
by  my  landlord  to  a  small,  black-eyed  man  wearing 
plain  clothing  and  speaking  the  plain  language  of 
'thee  and  thou,'  as  'Dr.  Burr,  from  New  Philadel- 
phia, Ohio,  who  was  about  to  settle  in  Connersville  as 
a  root  Doctor.'  Some  days  after  there  was  nailed  to 
the  weather-boarding  of  the  hotel  an  enormous  swamp- 
lily  root  almost  as  large  as  a  man,  with  head,  eyes, 
ears,  nose  and  mouth  nicely  carved,  arms  and  legs 
with  feet  stuck  on.  And  just  above  the  sign  on  a 
board  marked  with  chalk:  'Joseph  S.  Burr,  Root 
Doctor — -No  Calomel.'  The  Doctor  was  subsequently 
engaged  in  the  drug  business,  and  for  a  long  time 
enjoyed  a  rather  extensive  practice.  One  well 
acquainted  with  him  over  half  a  century  ago,  says: 
'He  was  a  man  of  some  medical  knowledge  which 
he  used  with  moderate  success  in  his  practice,  while 
to  his  patrons  he  utterly  denounced  all  '  doctor 
laruin  "  and  made  it  on  the  /  root '  system.     His  chief 


ability  consisted  of  cunning  aided  by  a  knowledge  of 
human  nature."  v 

Dr.  Gayle  was  a  talented  man  but  died  young,  his 
death  occurring  in  October,  1827,  at  the  age  of  thirty- 
two  years,  on  which  occasion  the  press  said  of  him: 
"  As  a  man  of  talent,  the  Doctor  was  excelled  by  few 
if  any  in  the  State;  as  a  practicing  physician  he  was 
eminently  successful  and  popular." 

Dr.  Philip  Mason  was  a  native  of  Adams,  Berk- 
shire Co.,  Mass.,  born  December  10,  1793.  He 
settled  in  what  is  now  Fayette  County  in  1816.  He 
served  as  one  of  the  Franklin  County  Commissioners 
when  Fayette  County  was  a  part  of  that  county.  In 
1824  he  finished  his  course  of  reading  and  clinical 
studies  under  Dr.  Moffitt,  of  Connersville,  and  began 
the  practice  of  medicine  at  his  farm  in  Columbia 
Township,  where  he  remained  until  the  spring  of 
1827,  then  removed  to  the  village  of  Danville  (now 
Fayettville),  and  there  in  connection  with  the  now 
venerable  Dr.  Jefferson  Helm,  of  Rushville,  who  had 
been  one  of  his  pupils,  settled  in  the  practice  of  his 
profession.  On  the  death  of  Dr.  Gayle,  in  the  fol- 
lowing fall.  Dr.  Mason  removed  to  Connersville.  In 
1829  he  was  elected  the  first  Probate  Judge  of  Fayette 
County,  and  served  as  such  until  1834.  The  year 
following  he  was  elected  to  the  Legislature  and  was 
twice  re-elected  to  that  body.  He  served  as  Master  of 
Warren  Lodo-e,F.  &amp;  A.  M.,  of  Connersville,  for  thirteen 
years,  and  as  Grand  Master  of  the  Grand  Lodge  of  the 
State  for  eight  years.  Dr.  Mason  was  a  brilliant  and 
educated  man,  who  is  still  quite  well 'remembered  in 
the  profession  as  the  author  of  an  able,  though  some- 
what lengthy  "Autobiography  and  Family  History." 

Dr.  Jefferson  Helm,  a  son  of  Judge  Helm,  is  a 
native  of  Mason  County,  Ky.,  born  in  1803.  He 
studied  medicine  with  Drs.  Moffitt  and  Mason;  was 
licensed  to  practice  in  1827,  and  that  year  located  at 
Danville  (now  Fayetteville),  in  partnership  with  Dr. 
Mason.  After  several  years  he  removed  to  Vienna 
(now  Glenwood),  Rush  County,  where  he  remained 
until  about  1845.  Later  he  removed  to  Rushville. 
In  1850  he  was  a  delegate  to  the  State  Constitutional 
Convention,  and  two  years  later  was  elected  to  the 
State  Senate.  He  still  resides  in  Rushville,  though 
not  engaged  in  the  practice  of  his  profession. 

Dr.  Hayman  W.  Clark  was  licensed  to  practice 
medicine  at  the  same  time  with  Dr.  Helm  in  1827. 

In  1828  Dr.  Samuel  Miller  located  in  Connersville, 
having  come  from  Dayton,  Ohio. 

Another  practitioner  who  advertised  in  the  press 
of  1830,  was  Dr.  Charles  Barnes. 

DISTRICT  MEDICAL    SOCIETIES. 

An  effort  to  establish  medical  societies  in  the 
State  by  legislative  enactment  was  made  at  an  early 


106 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


period.  Section  1  of  Act  approved  by  Gov.  Jennings 
December  24,  1816,  reads:  "  Be  it  enacted  by  the 
General  Assembly  of  the  State  of  Indiana,  that  for 
the  purpose  of  regulating  the  practice  of  physic  and 
surgery  in  this  State,  each  circuit  as  laid  off  for  hold- 
ing Circuit  Courts  shall  compose  one  medical  district 
to  be  known  as  First,  Second  and  Third  Medical  Dis- 
tricts in  the  State  of  Indiana,  according  to  the  name 
of  the  circuit."  It  was  further  provided  in  this  act 
that  in  each  district  there  should  be  a  Board  of  Med- 
ical Censors,  who  were  required  to  admit  to  mem- 
bership every  physician  or  surgeon  residing  or  wish- 
ing to  practice  in  the  district  who  should  "on  exam- 
ination before  them,  give  proof  of  their  qualification 
to  practice  either  profession,  and  reasonable  evidence 
of  their  moral  character." 

An  act  approved  January  18,1820,  organized  four 
medical  districts,  and  gave  the  State  Medical  Society 
authority  to  establish  as  many  additional  as  it  might 
deem  expedient. 

The  State  Medical  Society  was  first  organized  in 
1820,  and  held  its  meetings  at  Corydon,  then  capital 
of  the  State,  until  1826, when  it  met  at  Indianapolis. 

Agreeably  to  the  statute  law  of  the  State  passed  in 
1825,  and  a  resolution  of  the  State  Medical  Society 
passed  at  their  meeting  subsequently,  a  number  of 
the  physicians  of  the  Fifth  District  met  in  Conners- 
ville.  May  7,  1827,  for  the  purpose  specified  in  the 
act  and  resolution  referred  to.  James  Thomas  was 
called  to  the  chair,  and  T.  E.  Gayle  appointed  Sec- 
retary pro  tern.  The  society  was  formed  and  officers 
appointed  as  follows:  James  Thomas,  President; 
William  B.  Laughlin,  Seci'etary  and  Treasurer; 
Joseph  Moffitt,  H.  G.  Sexton  and  T.  E.  Gayle,  Cen- 
sors. The  first  applicants  examined  for  license  who 
were  found  qualified  to  receive  the  same  were  Philip 
Mason,  H.  W.  Clark  and  Jefferson  Helm. 

EARLY    CHA.ROE8    FOR    MEDICAL    SERVICES. 

The  act  of  the  Legislature  of  1816,  above  re- 
ferred to,  provided  against  overcharges:  "It  shall  not 
be  lawful  for  any  physician  or  surgeon  to  charge  or 
receive  more  than  12J  cents  per  mile  for  every  mile 
he  shall  travel  in  going  to,  and  returning  home  from, 
the  place  of  residence  (for  the  time  being)  of  his  pa- 
tient, with  an  addition  of  lOO  per  cent  for  traveling 
in  the  night. 

The  following  is  a  list  of  charges  recommended 
by  the  Indiana  State  Medical  Society  held  at  Cory- 
don December  11,  1822: 

Visit 25  cents  to  $1.00 

Mileage .25 

Venesection 25        "  .50

Obstetrics 5.00 

Extracting  tooth .25 

Reducing  luxation 5.00  to   10.00 

Amputation 20.00  to   50.00 

LATER  PHYSICIANS. 

Dr.  Ryland  T.  Brown  is  a  native  of  Lewis  County, 
Ky.  His  father  came  to  Rush  County,  Ind. ,  in  1821, 
and  for  several  years  the  son  acted  as  guide  to  land- 
seekers.  His  knowledge  of  medicine  and  other  sub- 
jects was  principally  acquired  without  the  aid  of  a 
master,  and  but  few  men  who  have  attained  to  equal 
eminence  in  the  profession  have  qualified  themselves 
for  it  under  greater  difficulties.  To  aid  him  in  the 
study  of  anatomy,  he  is  said  to  have  constructed  a 
skeleton  out  of  the  bones  of  an  Indian  that  had  been 
exhumed  near  his  father's  farm.  He  graduated  from 
the  Ohio  Medical  College,  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  in  the 
spring  of  1829.  In  August,  1832,  he  located  in  Con- 
nersville,  and  for  several  years  was  a  partner  of  Dr. 
Mason's.  He]  remained  in  Connersville  until  1842. 
In  1854  Dr.  R.  T.  Brown  acted  as  State  Geologist  by 
the  appointment  of  Gov.  Wright,  and  in  1858  he  was 
elected  to  the  Chair  of  Natural  Science  in  the  N.  W. 

C.  University  at  Indianapolis,  and  has  been  for  sev- 
eral years  an  honored  resident  of  that  city.  He  is 
known  throughout  the  State  as  the  author  of  "Brown's 
Physiology,"  a  common  school  textbook  of  recog- 
nized merit.  The  Doctor  has  attained  an  honorable 
old  age  without  the  usual  signs  of  mental  decay. 

The]  regular  practicing  physicians  of  Fayette 
County  in  1832  were  Drs.  Joseph  Moffitt,  Samuel 
Miller,  R.  T.  Brown,  of  Connersville,  and  Dr.  Mason 
on  his  farm  below  Null's  Mill,  now  Null  Town.     Dr. 

D.  D.  Hall,  a  Virginian,  located  in  Connersville, 
where  he  continued  to  practice  until  his  death,  which 
occurred  June  20,  1871. 

Among  the  early  members  of  the  Fifth  District 
Medical  Society,  were  men  of  merit  and  of  high  pro- 
fessional standing,  and  all  labored  to  develop  the 
truths  of  medical  science,  and  all  made  an  impress 
on  their  generation. 

Drs.  William  B.  Laughlin,  H.  G.  Sexton  and  John 
Arnold  played  an  important  part  in  the  history  of 
Rush  County.  The  first- mentioned,  we  believe,  was 
the  first  physician  to  locate  in  that  county.  He  did 
much  of  the  early  surveying,  laid  out  the  county  seat 
and  suggested  the  name  Rushville  in  honor  of  his 
noble  preceptor,  Dr.  Rush,  of  Philadelphia.  He  was 
a  classical  scholar,  and  in  1828  established  a  classi- 
cal school  in  that  village. 

In  Fayette  County  can  be  recalled  the  names  of 
Drs.  P.  Mason,  S.  Miller,  R.  T.  Brown,  D.  D.  Hall, 
J.  Thomas,  T.  E.  Gayle,  J.  Moffitt  and  J.  Helm;  in 
Union  County,  Drs.  Everetts,  Rose,  Casterline  and 
Cox;  in  Franklin  County,  Drs.  Berry  and  Heymond. 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


107 


After  the  Fifth  District  Medical  Society  had  out- 
lived its  usefulness,  there  was  organized  a  society 
under  a  special  charter  from  the  Legislature,  possess- 
ing power  to  examine  and  license  candidates  for  the 
practice  of  medicine  within  the  limits  of  the  organi- 
zation. It  was  styled  the  Indiana  Medical  Institute, 
and  embraced  the  counties  included  in  the  Fifth 
District  Medical  Society.  This,  however  had  but  a 
brief  existence. 

The  physicians  of  Fayette  County  as  given  in  a 
published  statement  in  1846  were:  Drs.  PhiKp 
Mason,  Samuel  Miller,  D.  D.  Hall,  John  Arnold,  E. 
A.  Bacon,  and  S.  W.  Hughes,  of  Connersville;  Green- 
bury  Steele,  Columbia  Township;  Alfred  Ruby, 
Alquina;  George  Winchel,  Columbia;  U.  B.  Tingley, 
Harrisburg;  Amos  Chapman,  Waterloo;  Presley 
Libray,  West  Union  (now  Everton),  and  Ed  Daniels, 
Fayetteville. 

Dr.     George  K.    Chitwood    was  born    in  Gallia 
County,   Ohio,    May  10,   1805,  and  was    licensed  to 
practice  medicine  and  surgery  in   1830.     He  located 
as  a  physician  in  Franklin  County,  Ind.,  in  1831,  and 
in  1835-36  he  attended  a  course  of  lectures  in  the 
Ohio  Medical  College.     He  continued  the  practice  in 
Franklin    County    until    December,    1837,   when  he 
changed  his  location  to  Liberty,  Union  County.     In 
1846  he  received  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Medicine 
from  the  Western  Reserve  Medical  College  at  Cleve- 
land, Ohio.     In  December,  1849,  he  moved  to  Con- 
nersville,   Ind.,    where  he  soon   enjoyed  a  lucrative 
practice,  and  where  he  has  remained  ever  since.     In 
October,     1859,    Dr.    Chitwood  was  elected   by   the 
Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Cincinnati  College  of  Medi- 
cine and  Surgery  to  the  chair  of  General  Pathology 
and  Physical  Diagnosis,  which  position  he  filled  for 
the  session  of  1859-60.     He  was  then  transferred  to 
the  chair  of  Obstetrics  and  the  Diseases  of  Women 
and  Children,  where  he  remained  for  six  consecutive 
sessions,  at  which  time  he  resigned  in  consequence  of 
domestic    aiBictions.     In  1868    he  was  tendered  the 
same   position,  but   declined    it.      He    is  now    quite 
advanced  in  years,  but  enjoys  an  unusual  immunity 
from  the  effects  of  age. 

Dr.  John  Arnold  has  for  many  years  been  located 
at  Rusbville,  where  he  has  an  extensive  practice. 
He  is  a  gentleman  of  considerable  literary  attain- 
ments, having  written  several  highly  interesting  rem- 
iniscences of  pioneer  life  in  Rush  County. 


FAYETTE   COUNTY  MEDICAL  SOCIETY  AND  THE    PROFESSION. 

On  the  24th  of  May,  1856,  the  physicians  of  Fay- 
ette County  met  and  effected  an  organization,  calling 
it  the  Whitewater  Yalley  Mfdical  Society.  In  the 
temporary  organization  Dr.  G.  R.  Chitwood  presided 


and  Dr.  Samuel  W.  Vance  acted  as  Secretary.  Per- 
manent organization  was  forthwith  effected  by  the 
election  of  the  following  officers:  Dr.  Amos  Chap- 
man, of  Alquina,  President;  W.  W.  Taylor,  of  Vienna 
(now  Glen  wood),  Vice-President;  S.  W.  Vance,  Con- 
nersville, Recording  Secretary;  L.  D.  Sheets,  Lib- 
erty, Corresponding  Secretary;  D.  D.  Hall,  Conners- 
ville, Treasurer;  Daniel  Frembly,  of  Brownsville, 
George  R.  Chitwood  and  O.  S.  Ramsey,  Censors. 
The  following  were  charter  members  of  this  society: 
Drs.  Samuel  Miller,  D.  D.  Hall,  A.  Chapman,  P.  S. 
Silvey  (Everton),  W.  J.  Pepper,  D.  Frembly,  W.  W. 
Taylor,  S.  W.  Vance,   H.  W.  Hazzard  (Bentonville), 

A.  H.  Thompson  (Everton),  G.  R.  Chitwood,  M.  F. 
Miller  (Everton),  C.  D.  B.  O'Ryan,  V.  H.  Gregg, 
R.  T.  Gillum  (Waterloo),  U.  B.  Tingley  (Harrisburg), 
and  O.  S.  Ramsey.  All  the  foregoing  not  located 
belonged  in  Connersville.  About  this  time  Dr.^W. 
J.  Pepper  finished  his  course  of  reading  under  Dr.  G. 

B.  Chitwood,  and  began  practicing  in  Connersville, 
where  he  still  resides. 

At  the  next  yearly  meeting,  April  13,  1857,  the 
record  shows  the  following  election  of  officers:  D.  D. 
Hall,  President;  P.  S.  Silvey,  Vice-President;  W.  W. 
Taylor,  Recording  Secretary;  G.  R.  Chitwood,  Cor- 
responding Secretary;  H.  W.  Hazzard,  Treasurer,  and 
Drs.  Vance,  Gregg  and  Pepper,  Censors. 

On  April  22,  1858,  this  society  was  dissolved  by 
mutual  consent  of  its  officers  and  members,  and  on 
the  1st  of  May  following,  the  physicians  met  at  the 
court  house  and  founded  the  Fayette  County  Medical 
Society  with  the  following  officers:  U.  B.  Tingley, 
President;  P.  S.  Silvey,  Vice-President;  S.W.Vance, 
Corresponding  and  Recording  Secretary,  and  Drs. 
Gregg,  Pepper  and  Chapman,  Censors.  The  society 
retained  its  working  organization  until  the  breaking- 
out  of  the  Civil  war,  in  1861,  when  its  deliberations 
were  quietly  discontinued  in  the  general  suspense 
that  followed  the  first  clash  of  arms. 

In  the  meantime  Dr.  W.  W.  Taylor,  who  had  lo- 
cated in  Connersville  some  years  before,  died  in  1859. 
He  was  widely  known  for  his  skill  as  a  practitioner, 
eminent  as  a  scholar,  beloved  as  a  neighbor  and  hon- 
ored as  a  citizen. 

Dr.  V.  H.  Gregg  entered  the  army  as  Surgeon  in 
the  First  Brigade,  First  Division,  Twenty-third  Army 
Corps,  and  served  in  the  Department  of  the  Cumber- 
land, under  Gen.  Sherman,  till  the  close  of  the  war. 

Dr.  Joshua  Chitwood  graduated  in  medicine  in 
1858,  and  entered  the  army  as  Surgeon  in  the  Seventh 
Indiana  Cavalry,  Department  of  the  Cumberland. 

Dr.  George  W.  Garver  located  in  Connersville  in 
1865,  having  served  in  the  United  States  Navy  as 
Assistant  Surgeon  on  the  Western  Flotilla,  Depart- 
ment of  the  Mississippi.

HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Dr.  S.  W.  Hughs  died  in  1865,  and  was  buried  in 
the  new  cemetery. 

During  the  four  years  of  national  strife,  no  at- 
tempt was  made  to  reorganize  the  Fayette  County 
Medical  Society,  but  after  the  establishment  of  peace, 
when  the  interrupted  trades  and  professions  began 
to  wheel  into  the  line  of  reconstruction  and  progress 
we  find  this  organization  keeping  pace  with  the  rest, 
and  this  time  re-enforced  by  several  recruits. 

In  "1866  the  Fayette  County  Medical  Society  re- 
organized with  the  following  membership:     Drs.  D. 

D.  Hall,  W.  J.  Pepper,  S.  W.  Vance,  G.  R.  Chit- 
wood,  Josh  Chitwood,  V.  H.  Gregg,  U.  B.  Tingley,  G. 
W.  Garver,  A.  Koogler,  J.  G.  Larimore,  W.  H. 
Smith  and  R.  W.  Sipe.  The  latter  three  represented 
respectively  Waterloo,  Fairview  and  Fayetteville. 
The  new  members  were  Drs.  J.  A.  Smith,  Lyons;    J. 

E.  Jones,  now  of  Cincinnati;  A.  H.  Philips,  Water- 
loo; Max  Scheller,  Connersville;  B.  Reeves,  Fair- 
view. 

Since  the  organization  of  1866  the  following  phy- 
sicians have  become  members  of  the  society:  Drs.  J. 
A.  Zeigler,  Brownsville;  John  E.  Chitwood,  Conners- 
ville; S.  N.  Hamilton,  Everton;  B.  F.  Day,  Water- 
loo, all  in  the  year  1877;  and  L.  Alexander,  now  of 
Pendleton,  in  1878. 

Meanwhile,  the  members  of  these  local  or  county, 
societies  being  under  the  dispensation  of  1866,  were 
precluded  from  attending  the  State  Medical  Society, 
except  as  they  were  sent  to  that  body  as  delegates 
from  their  respective  counties.  In  1878  the  State 
Society  decreed  that  all  members  in  good  standing  in 
all  subordinate  societies  be  thenceforth  entitled  to  dele- 
gate rights.  This  decree  made  all  the  county  societies 
auxiliary  to  the  State  society.  These  "  delegate 
rights,"  however,  were  not  absolute,  though  they 
were  not  limited  save  in  matters  pertaining  to  legis- 
lation, this  right  vesting  in  appointees  designated  by 
the  respective  county  societies.  The  Fayette  County 
Medical  Society  did  not  immediately  accept  the  pro- 
visions of  this  new  dispensation,  but  in  1879  fell  into 
line  with  the  rest,  and  applied  for  admission  into  the 
State  organization.  Under  this  code  all  the  ctjunty 
societies  were  required  to  draft  new  constitutions  and 
by-laws,  or  so  remodel  their  old  ones  as  to  make  them 


consistent  with  the  new  order  of  things.     The  annual 
assessment  per  capita  is  $1. 

Pursuant  to  reorganization  the  Fayette  County 
Medical  Society  elected  the  following  oflScers:  S.  W. 
Vance,  President;  W.  J.  Pepper,  Vice-President; 
Joshua  Chitwood,  Secretary;  V.  H.  Gregg,  Treasurer, 
all  located  in  Connersville.  For  Censors,  S.  N.  Ham- 
ilton, Everton;  George  R.  Chitwood,  Connersville, 
and  G.  A.  Sigler,  Brownsville,  Union  County.  This 
left  a  rather  meager  constituency  as  to  members,  only 
three,  namely.  J.  E.  Chitwood,  B.  F.  Day,  J.  A. 
Smith.  Subsequently,  the  following  members  have 
been  added:  Charles  Wyman,  Lyon's  Station,  in 
1880;  C.  H.  Von  Klein,  L.  D.  Dillman  and  D.  M. 
La  Moree,  Connersville,  in  1882;  Garrett  Pigman,  O. 
P.  Phares  and  F.  A.  Chitwood,  Connersville,  in  1884 
Dr.  Sigler  removed  from  Brownsville  to  Liberty, 
UnionCounty,  in  1883.  Dr.  Hamilton  located  in  Con- 
nersville in  1882,  entering  into  partnership  with  Dr. 
Gregg.  Dr.  Von  Klein  removed  to  Hamilton,  Ohio, 
in  1882,  and  thence  to  Dayton,  where  he  still  resides. 
The  latter  was  Surgeon  in  the  Rasso -Turkish  war, 
after  which  he  came  to  this  country,  locating  first  in 
Batesville,  Ind.,  then  in  Brookville,  then  in  Conners- 
ville, where  he  remained  but  a  few  months.  He  is  a 
man  of  considei-able  learning  and  wide  experience, 
being  the  author  of  several  medical  works,  and  the 
possessor  of  a  library  consisting  of  6,000  volumes, 
printed  in  French,  German,  Russian  and  English,  all 
of  which  languages  he  speaks  with  fluency. 

Dr.  La  Moree  located  in  Alquina  in  1883,  and 
shortly  afterward  left  for  Pennsylvania,  Dr.  Phares 
taking  his  place  at  Alquina. 

The  following  is  the  present  membership  of  the 
society:  Drs.  G.  R.  Chitwood,  Joshua  Chitwood, 
John  E.  Chitwood,  F.  A  Chitwood,  V.  H.  Gregg,  S. 
N.  Hamilton,  W.  J.  Pepper,  R.  W.  Sipe,  L.  D.  Dill- 
man,  Charles  Wyman,  Garrett  Pigman  and  O.  P. 
Phares.  Dr.  S.  W.  Vance  withdrew  from  the  society 
in  1882. 

The  following  physicians  of  Connersville  are  not 
members  of  the  society:  Drs.  Elias  Webster,  homoeo- 
pathic, located  in  Fayette  County  in  1864;  A.  D.  Ter- 
rell, eclectic,  in  1863;  D.  W.  Butler,  in  1876,  the 
present  Health  Officer,  and  John  Wall,  in  1879.

DISTINGUISHED   DEAD. 
OLIVER  H.  SMITH— JONATHAN  McCARTY— CALEB  B.  SMITH— SAMUEL  W.  PARKER— JAMES  C.  MoINTOSH. 


"Ah!  who  can  tell  how  hard  it  is  to  climb 

The  steep  where  fame's  proud  temple  shines  afar; 

Ah!  who  can  tell  how  many  a  soul  sublime 

Has  felt  the  influence  of  malignant  star, 

And  waged  with  fortune  an  eternal  war — 

Checked  by  the  scoS  of  pride — by  envy's  frown, 

By  poverty's  unconquerable  bar, 

In  life's  lone  vale,  remote,  has  pined  alone, 

Then  dropt  into  the  grave  unpitied  and  unknown! " 

IT  is  thought  that  a  chapter  devoted  to  the  lives  of 
deceased  citizens,  who  were  honored  with  high 
ofiScial  positions,  or  reached  eminence  in  their  profes- 
sions, may  with  propriety  be  given  in  this  part  of  the 
work.  Sketches  of  the  lives  of  other  deceased  citi- 
zens of  equal  worthiness,  and  perhaps  prominence  in 
their  several  fields,  have  been  given  in  variotis  other 
chapters  throughout  the  work,  as,  for  instance,  New- 
ton Claypool,  Daniel  Han  kins,  George  Frybarger, 
Joshua  Harlan,  and  others  among  the  early  business 
men  of  Connersville;  Abraham  Van  Vleet,  Daniel 
Bench  and  others,  of  the  press;  Wilson  Thompson, 
James  Conwell  and  others,  of  the  clergymen;  Judge 
Eeid,  the  Truslers  and  others,  of  the  legal  profession; 
Drs.  Gayle,  Moffitt,  Mason  and  others,  of  the  medical 
profession;  John  Conner,  Thomas  Simpson,  Judges 
Helm  and  Webb,  Jonathan  John  and  many  others  of 
the  pioneers  in  general,  etc.,  etc.,  etc. 

OLIVER    H.    SMITH. 

Oliver  H.  Smith  was  the  only  resident  of  Fayette 
County  who  reached  the  high  position  of  United 
States  Senator.  His  place  of  birth  and  early  life  can 
not  be  more  beautifully  and  impressively  related  than 
in  his  own  language:  "  My  grandparents  on  both 
sides  were  fi'iends  and  associates  of  William  Penn; 
crossed  the  Atlantic  from  England  with  him,  and 
belonged  to  the  same  society.  The  steamer,  as  she 
runs  up  the  Delaware  (from  Philadelphia)  passes  one 
of  the  most  beautiful  countries,  on  the  Pennsylvania 
side,  in  the  world,  highly  cultivated.  On  the  Jersey 
side  it  is  more  wild  and  picturesque.  On  the  Penn- 
sylvania side  stands  the  beautiful  city  of  Bristol.  On 
the  Jersey  stand  Burlington  and  Bordentown.  Near 
the  latter  is  seen  in  the  deeply  shaded  grove  the  man- 
sion of  the  late  ex-King,  Joseph  Bonaparte,  as  it  rose 
from  the  ashes  of  his  former  splendid  residence.  The 
city  of   Trenton,   the  capital   of   New  Jersey,  stands 


prominent  on  the  right.  The  more  humble  Morris - 
ville  covers  the  left  bank  at  the  falls  of  the  Delaware, 
where  the  permanent  arch-bridge  unites  the  two 
cities. 

"  When  but  a  mere  youth,  as  I  was  approaching 
Morrisville  in  the  dusk  of  the  evening,  I  heard  the 
cry  of  fire  just  as  I  reached  the  center  of  the  town.  I 
saw  a  man  walking  upon  the  top  of  a  house,  bucket 
in  hand,  without  a  hat,  sprinkling  water  upon  the 
roof.  A  gentleman  in  the  crowd  asked  me  if  I  knew 
who  he  was,  and  remarked,  '  This  is  Gen.  Moreau,  of 
France. '  The  General  came  down  after  a  short  time, 
and  I  had  a  full  view  of  him.  I  looked  upon  the 
hero  of  Hohenlinden  at  the  time  with  much  interest. 
He  was  short  and  thick,  dark  complexion,  black  hair, 
eyes  Jind  whiskers,  stern  countenance.  He  afterward 
fell  by  a  cannon  shot  at  the  battle  of  Dresden  in  1813, 
while  fighting  with  the  allies  against  the  French  Army 
under  the  command  of  Napoleon. 

"At  Trenton  the  tide  ceases;  the  rocky  shoals  and 
rapid  currents  of  the  Delaware  commence.  The  trav- 
eler leaves  the  steamer  and  takes  the  cars.  Some 
twelve  miles  above  the  city  of  Trenton,  the  current  of 
the  river  becomes  still  more  rapid;  the  water  dashes 
over  Well's  Falls;  Smith's  Island  divides  their  chan- 
nel at  the  base.  That  island  belonged  to  my  grand- 
father, and  descended  to  my  father.  Here  I  must 
stop  and  let  the  traveler  pass  on  to  look  at  the  moun- 
tain scenery  on  the  upper  Delaware,  as  it  winds  its 
serpentine  way  north  to  the  State  of  New  York,  where 
he  finds  his  source.  I  have  arrived  at  the  place  of 
my  birth,  on  the  23d  of  October,  in  the  year  1794. 
The  beautiful  Delaware,  with  its  clear  waters,  rapid 
currents,  floating  rafts,  tine  shad  and  beautiful  striped 
bass,  stretches  away  in  the  distance  from  my  father's 
farm,  the  Jersey  hills  rising  one  above  another  to  the 
clouds  on  the  east;  on  the  west  a  beautiful  ridge;  on 
the  north  Bowman's  Hill.  Near  the  junction  of  the 
hills  was  found  many  years  ago  a  few  acres  of  level 
ground  in  the  woods.  The  early  settlers,  my  father 
among  them,  selected  this  spot  for  their  schoolhouse. 
It  was  a  most  solitary  location,  only  found  by  the 
schoolboys  by  their  winding  paths  from  their  valley 
and  mountain  homes.  The  neighbors  met,  the  ground 
was  prepared,  and  the  schoolhouse  built 


no 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


"The  building  was  20x26  feet  of  undressed 
mountain  rock,  one  low  story,  four  windows  of  8x10 
glass  on  each  side,  and  two  at  each  end,  a  continuous 
desk  around  the  wall  on  three  sides,  with  a  corres- 
ponding bench  for  the  scholars.  When  I  first  entered 
the  schoolhouse,  at  the  age  of  six  years,  in  the  year 
1800 — I  distinctly  remember  the  day — with  my  little 
dinner  basket  on  my  arm,  the  master  was  sitting  at 
his  desk  on  the  right  of  the  door,  and  a  large  bucket 
of  water  on  the  loft.  Our  playing  grounds  were 
cleared  smooth  from  surface  rock.  Our  path  led  us 
to  the  top  of  Bowman's  Hill,  where  we  had  a  splendid 
view  of  the  Delaware  and  surrounding  country  for 
many  miles.  I  have  .often  thought,  in  after  years, 
that  these  views  in  my  youth  exercised  a  powerful 
influence  over  mv  mind.  The  same  feelings  that 
prompted  me  in  my  early  life  to  break  over  the 
bounds  of  my  valley  home,  pushed  me  onto  look  over 
the  towering  Alleghany  into  the  beautiful  valley  of 
the  Mississippi. 

"  The  school-boys  one  evening  roped  a  little  intox- 
icated Irishman,  who  happened  to  be  passing  by.  He 
got  very  angry  and  named  the  schoolhouse  Lurgan, 
after  a  place  of  that  name  in  Ireland,  and  from  that 
day  it  went  by  no  other  name.  I  saw  it  when  after 
an  absence  of  twenty  years  in  the  West,  I  visited  the 
home  of  my  youth;  I  looked  upon  it  with  deep  feel- 
ings, as  my  alma  mater." 

The  parents  of  the  distinguished  Senator  were 
Thomas  and  Lsetitia  Smith  buried,  the  former  at 
Wrightstown  and  the  latter  at  Byberry. 

At  Lurgan  our  subject  received  about  all  the 
regular  education  he  ever  obtained.  What  he 
acquired  afterward  was  under  his  own  tuition. 

In  1813,  on  the  death  of  his  father,  he  left  home 
on  foot  with  a  few  dollars  in  his  pocket,  to  see  the 
world.  "I  had  seen  very  little  of  the  world;  thirty 
miles  was  the  farthest  I  had  ever  been  from  home.  I 
longed  to  see  beyond  the  river  hills  of  the  Delaware." 
He  went  by  way  of  Morristown  to  New  York,  and 
"  gazed  up  and  down  the  city  with  astonishment  and 
delight."  Thence  he  went  up  the  Hudson,  and  on 
reaching  West  Point  he  says:  "  This  spot  was  conse- 
crated to  my  youthful  mind;  here  waved  the  Nation's 
flag.  I  asked  the  Captain  to  stop  and  let  me  see  Fort 
Putnam.  He  at  once  consented  and  we  landed.  I  now 
stood  on  Revolutionary  ground,  my  heart  beat  quick 
and  joyous;  I  ran  up  Mount  Independence,  where 
stood  old  Fort  Putnam,  venerable  in  its  ruins,  stern 
monument  of  a  sterner  age;  it  had  survived  the 
assaults  of  tyranny,  and  the  attempts  of  treason.  I 
stood  at  the  rock  from  which  the  chain  was  stretched 
across  the  narrow  channel  of  the  river  in  the  time  of 
the  Revolution,  to  prevent  the  passage  of  the  British 
vessels.     While  I  stood  upon  old  Fort  Putnam,  and 


cast  my  eye  far  down  the  magestic  river  toward  New 
York,  the  scenes  of  the  Revolution,  the  treason  of 
Arnold,  the  capture  and  execution  of  Andre,  with  a 
thousand  associations,  rushed  upon  me." 

He  returned  home  again,  but  whether  he  remained 
any  length  of  time  we  do  not  know,  but  presume  he 
did  not,  as  he  was  employed  in  a  cotton  or  woolen 
mill  for  some  time  in  Pennsylvania  before  coming 
West.  In  the  spring  of  1817  he  came  to  Indiana  and 
first  settled  at  Rising  Sun,  where  he  remained  until 
the  winter  of  1818,  then  removed  to  Lawrenceburg, 
where  it  is  believed  he  read  law  with  Gen.  Dill  and 
was  admitted  to  the  bar  at  the  March  term  of  the 
Dearborn  County  Court,  receiving  his  license  to 
practice  from  the  hand  of  Judge  Miles  C.  Eggleston, 
who  examined  him  in  person.  Says  the  Senator: 
"His  remarks  made  a  deep  impression  upon  me.  My 
means  were  exhausted,  and  it  was  a  question  of  life 
and  death  with  me."  The  Judge  kindly  remarked: 
"  Mr.  Smith,  I  will  sign  your  license,  but  you  are 
only  prepared  to  commence  the  study;  but  don't  be 
discouraged,  but  persevere  in  your  studies,  and  you 
may  yet  stand  high  in  your  profession." 

Young  Smith  directly  after  procuring  his  license  re- 
moved to  Versailles,  in  Ripley  County,  and  there  began 
his  professional  life.  His  first  case  was  a  trespass 
quare  clausum  f regit — "as  his  Blackstone  told  him." 
A  neighbor  had  bored  another's  sugar-tree  without 
asking.  Smith  represented  the  plaintiff  and  secured 
a  verdict  of  12J  cents.  His  fee  was  $2.50.  In  the 
spring  of  1820  Mr.  Smith  left  Versailles,  removing  to 
C'jnnersville,  where  he  made  his  first  plange  into  the 
heady  current  of  pioneer  life.  He  had  been  in  Con- 
nersville  but  eighteen  months  when  he  was  induced 
to  run  for  the  Legislature,  and  in  August,  1822,  he 
was  elected.  He  served  during  the  session  of  1822- 
23  and  was  the  member  by  whom  the  name  was  given 
to  Johnson  County,  which  was  named  after  Judge 
Johnson,  of  Indiana.  Mr.  Smith  remarks,  "It  so  hap- 
pened that  it  was  the  greenest  Legislature  ever  con- 
vened in  the  State.  The  raw  material  was  not  so 
defective  as  the  experience  of  the  m;mbers.  The 
session  lasted  six  weeks  and  perhaps  no  Legislature 
ever  met  and  adjourned  in  the  State  doing  less  harm." 

Our  subject  was  made  Chairman  of  the  Committee 
on  the  Judiciary.  Referring  to  his  first  effort  in  that 
body  the  Senator  says,  "All  eyes  were  turned  to  me, 
as  the  Chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Committee,  suppos- 
ing, of  course,  that  I  knew  all  about  it.  The  house 
was  tilled  with  a  distinguished  audience  from  all 
parts  of  the  State,  and  several  from  Kentucky.  I 
arose.  It  was  my  first  efibrt  in  a  Legislative  capac- 
ity, and  much  was  expected  by  the  audience.  'Mr. 
Speaker,'  said  I.  These  were  my  only  words.  I  grew 
blind,  and   down   I  sank  in  my  chair,  almost  uncon-

scious,  when  Maj.  Henry  P.  Thorton,  who  was  our 
Clerk,  a  great  wag,  sprang  from  his  desk,  ran  to  where 
I  was  seated,  and  whispered  in  my  ear,  'My  dear  sir, 
you  must  have  studied  your  speech  at  home;  you  have 
made  a  powerful  constitutional  argument  '  " 

In  1824  he  was  appointed  Prosecuting  Attorney  of 
the  Third  Judicial  Circuit  by  Gov.  Hendricks,  in  which 
position  he  served  two  years,  and  distinguished  him- 
self by  the  prosecution  of  some  of  the  most  noted 
cases  in  the  criminal  history  of  the  State.  The 
southern  court  was  at  Vevay  and  the  northern  at 
Fort  Wayne,  and  during  the  two  years  he  served  as 
Prosecutor  there  wag  not  a  single  court  held  or  a 
grand  jury  impaneled  in  his  absence  on  the  circuit. 
He  became  a  candidate  for  Congress  in  1826  and 
was  elected  by  a  majority  of  1,500.  His  competi 
tor,  the  Hon.  John  Test,  was  one  of  the  first 
men  of  the  State;  had  been  on  the  court  bench, 
was  a  tine  lawyer,  a  good  speaker  and  had  repre- 
sented the  district  three  full  terms.  Mr.  Smith 
served  during  the  sessions  of  1827  and  1828,  contem- 
poraneous with  such  men  as  Tristriam  Burgess,  John 
Randolph,  Samuel  C.  Southard,  McDuff  and  others. 

It  will  be  well  to  inform  the  reader  that  the  first 
effort  of  Mr.  Smith  in  Congress,  though  not  flatteringly 
born,  resulted  in  greater  success  than  his  first  effort 
in  the  General  Assembly  of  the  State.  A  bill  appor- 
tioning $100,000  to  the  work  of  constructing  the 
Cumberland  road  was  before  the  House.  Philip  P. 
Barbour,  of  Virginia,  one  of  the  strongest  men  in  the 
House,  had  made  a  long  constitutional  argument  to 
prove  that  the  General  Government  had  no  power  to 
make  appropriations  to  construct  the  work.  His 
speech  was  able  and  its  effect  upon  the  favorite  meas- 
ure of  the  Indiana  delegation  was  greatly  feared. 
"My  colleagues  were  not  disposed  to  speak;  I  had 
not  spoken.  I  felt  much  reluctance  to  speaking,  but 
duty  seemed  to  require  it.  I  got  the  floor  for  the 
next  day.  The  Committee  arose,  and  the  House  ad- 
journed. I  was  in  for  my  first  speech  in  Congress. 
I  passed  a  sleepless  night.  I  concluded  to  back  out. 
By  daylight  I  was  up  walking  the  pavement  before 
my  boarding  house,  when  the  newsboy  handed  me  the 
National  Intelligencer,  wet  from  the  press.  I  opened 
the  paper,  glanced  over  the  Congressional  proceed- 
ings, looked  under  the  editorial  head,  when,  Oh  ! 
horror  of  horrors  !  there  it  was,  'The  Hon.  Oliver  H. 
Smith  will  address  the  Committee  to-day  in  reply  to 
the  Hon.  Philip  P.  Barbour  on  constitutional  powers.' 
Hero  I  was;  there  was  no  backing  out  without  dis- 
grace. I  could  eat  no  breakfast.  The  hour  arrived. 
The  house  was  crowded.  Mr.  Barbour  was  seated 
before  me.  My  friends  were  around  me  to  give  me 
courage.  I  grew  more  bold  as  I  advanced,  and  never 
to  this  day  did  I  feel  when  I  closed  a  two  hour's 


speech  that  I  had  done  myself  more  justice.  The 
bill  was  passed  by  a  large  majority." 

In  the  House  Mr.  Smith  made  no  conspicuous 
mark,  but  earned  and  gained  the  reputation  of  a 
hard  working,  honest  and  sensible  member.  On  the 
expiration  of  his  term  in  the  House  he  returned  to 
the  law,  and  continued  in  very  active  pursuit  of  his 
profession,  till  he  was  elected  to  the  United  States 
Senate  in  December,  1836,  over  Gov.  Noble  and  Gov. 
Hendricks,  his  predecessors.  He  first  entered  the 
Senate  during  the  executive  session  of  March,  1837. 
He  was  made  Chairman  on  the  Committee  on  Public 
Lands  in  that  body  over  R.  I.  Walker,  then  of  Mis- 
sissippi. Here  his  habits  of  hard,  constant  labor 
shone  conspicuously,  no  less  unimpeachable  integ- 
rity and  sound  judgment.  "So  thoroughly  was  his 
judgment  trusted  by  his  associates  on  the  Committee, 
and  his  industry  relied  on  to  do  all  necessary  work, 
that  he  became  absolutely  the  whole  Committee,  and 
when  a  reference  was  made  to  it,  it  waa  expected  of 
course  that  Mr.  Smith  would  see  all  about  it.  He 
was  publicly  complimented  by  Mr.  Clay  for  his 
services  to  the  country  in  that  position.  During  his 
term  as  Senator,  wo  believe  in  1838,  he  removed 
from  Connersville  to  Indianapolis,  where  he  after- 
ward resided,  practicing  his  profession  steadily  and 
successfully,  until  his  disease  compelled  him  to 
abandon  all  labor." 

Mr.  Smith,  soon  after  the  election  of  James  B. 
Ray  as  Governor  of  the  State,  was  offered  a  seat  on 
the  bench  of  the  Supreme  Court,  "but  having  no 
judicial  ambition,  and  not  being  willing  to  be  laid 
on  the  bench  at  a  salary  of  $700,  I  had  the  fortitude 
to  resist  the  temptation."  The  Senator  was  the 
author  of  a  work  published  in  1858,  under  the  title 
of  "Early  Indiana  Trials  and  Sketches." 

His  death  occurred  in  Indianapolis,  March  19, 
1859,  having  been  sick  for  nearly  a  year  with  a 
disease,  the  nature  of  which  we  believe  was  not 
clearly  marked.  The  Indianapolis  Journal  of  March 
21,  1859,  said:  "There  is  not  a  corner  of  the  State 
in  which  the  melancholy  announcement  of  the  death 
of  Hon.  Oliver  H.  Smith  which  we  make  this  morn- 
ing, will  not  wake  feelings  of  deep  and  sincere  sor- 
row. *  *  *  j£e  died  as  he  lived,  a  firm  and  sin- 
cere Christian.  No  man  since  the  lamented  Mar- 
shall's death  was  more  widely  known  or  highly 
esteemed.  His  eminent  public  career,  his  great  ser- 
vices to  the  cause  of  internal  improvement,  and  his 
unspotted  private  life  gave  him  a  place  in  the  pub- 
lic regard,  that  few  have  filled  more  worthily."

HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


tury,  from  which  sprang  men  of  considerable  note, 
was  that  of  the  McCarty  name.  Benjamin  McCarty, 
with  family,  emigrated  from  Grainger  County,  Tenn. , 
in  about  the  year  1801  or  1802,  and  temporarily 
stopped  on  Dry  Fork,  in  Ohio,  and  there  awaited  the 
preparation  of  the  lands  in  what  is  now  Franklin 
County,  for  market.  He  made  the  first  entry  in 
that  county,  and  in  1804  removed  thereto.  He  was 
made  one  of  the  first  Judges  of  the  county  courts, 
under  the  Territorial  Government.  He  is  said  to 
have  been  a  man  of  herculean  frame  and  of  a  strong 
mind.  Enoch  McCarty,  a  son,  was  a  member  of  the 
first  convention  that  formed  the  State  constitution;  of 
the  Legislature  repeatedly,  and  many  years  Clerk 
and  Judge  of  the  Franklin  Circuit  Court.  Of  him 
says  Oliver  H.  Smith:  "He  was  a  cool,  strong- 
minded  man,  of  the  very  first  standing  in  society, 
and  contributed  largely  to  the  mass  of  mind  that  con- 
trolled early  Indiana;  cast  all  his  influence  on  the 
side  of  morality  and  religion." 

Gen.  Jonathan  McCarty,  the  subject  of  this 
sketch,  was  born  in  Virginia  on  the  3d  of  August, 
1795.  He  was  reared  on  his  f ather' s  f arm,  which  was 
in  sight  of  the  village  of  Brookville,  and  commanded  a 
view  of  the  rugged  hills,  beautiful  and  fertile  valleys 
and  rippling  waters  of  the  Whitewater,  a  country 
upon  which  had  been  poured  out  with  a  lavish  hand 
of  the  beauties  from  nature's  great  store-house. 
Impressive  and  grand  is  the  scene.  Here  in  the  lit- 
tle log  school  house,  that  graced  the  hill-side  and 
valleys  of  the  neighboring  settlements,  was  educated 
Gen.  McCarty.  In  viewing  the  vicinity,  the  writer 
was  impressed  more  than  ever  with  the  words  of  Web- 
ster and  other  statesmen.  The  former,  on  being  asked 
where  his  youth  was  passed,  in  substance  replied,  "I 
lived  in  sight  of  the  ocean."  Others,  in  response  to 
interrogatories  concerning  what  was  raised  among 
the  rock-covered  hills  and  cliffs  of  portions  of  New 
England  said,  "Men.''  As  we  stood  below  the  village 
on  an  evening  in  June,  at  a  point  taking  in  in  full 
the  grandeur  of  the  scene  under  an  air  laden  with 
the  perfume  of  the  wild  roses,  sweet  clover  and  elders 
abounding  on  all  sides,  musing  over  the  past,  we 
asked  ourself,  Did  not  the  Tests,  the  Hannas,  the 
McCartys,  the  Nobles,  the  Wallaces,  the  Rays,  the 
Eads,  with  numerous  others,  gather  inspiration  from 
these  towering  and  forest-clad  hills? 

Jonathan  McCarty  for  a  time  assisted  his  brother 
Enoch  in  performing  the  duties  of  the  Clerk's  office, 
and  at  intervals  read  law,  being,  we  believe,  both  his 
own  tutor  and  perceptor,  and  in  the  course  of  time 
was  licensed  to  practice  law.  He  early  became  a  poli- 
tician, was  elected  to  the  Legislature  of  Franklin 
County  and  procured  the  passage  of  the  law  laying 
off  the  county  of  Fayette.      He  then  removed  to  the 


new  county,  settling  in  the  county  town  of  Conners- 
ville.  He  was  made  the  first  Clerk  of  the  Courts  of 
the  county  and  performed  the  duties  of  the  several 
other  county  offices  then  devolving  upon  that  officer. 
He  served  as  Clerk  of  the  Courts  of  the  county  until 
in  1828,  and  as  such  was  the  Recorder,  Clerk  to  the 
Commissioners,  etc.  In  1829  he  was  appointed  Re- 
ceiver of  public  moneys  in  the  land  office  at  Fort 
Wayne,  and  in  1830  removed  his  family  from  Con- 
nersville  to  that  point. 

In  1828  Gen.  McCarty  made  the  race  for  Con- 
gress, being  a  candidate  on  the  Democratic  ticket, 
his  opponent  being  Judge  John  Test,  of  Brookville, 
a  National  Republican.  The  conflict  resulted  in  the 
election  of  Judge  Test  by  a  triumphant  majority. 
In  an  address  delivered  by  the  General  during  the 
canvass  he  made  these  observations:  "I  have  resided 
for  more  than  twenty-five  years  in  the  territorial 
limits  of  what  now  forms  this  Congressional  District; 
first  in  the  county  of  Dearborn,  then  in  Franklin, 
then  in  Fayette,  my  present  residence.  *  *  Hav- 
ing been  reared  and  educated  in  the  western  country&gt; 
accustomed  to  its  policy  and  laws,  I  necessarily 
imbibed,  at  an  early  period,  those  Republican  prin- 
ciples so  repeatedly  and  practically  illustrated  in  the 
Western  States — and  have  always  been  proud  of  the 
name  and  title  of  a  Republican.''  Referring  to  hie 
views  as  regards  measures  of  national  policy,  he 
says,  "Upon  the  subject  of  internal  improvements 
and  a  fair  and  adequate  protection  of  American  in- 
dustry and  manufactures,  about  which  so  much  has 
been  said,  and  which  has  called  forth  the  ablest 
talents  of  the  Nation  on  both  sides  of  these  questions, 
it  seems  to  me  that  there  can  be  little  or  no  division 
of  sentiment  in  the  Western  States.  All  agree  in 
the  propriety  of  these  measures  and  but  few  doubt 
the  constitutional  power  of  the  Government  upon 
these  subjects.  Should  I  be  called  by  the  suffrages 
of  my  fellow-citizens  of  this  district,  to  represent 
them  in  the  councils  of  the  Nation,  I  shall  support 
the  principles  of  internal  improvements  and  the  pro- 
tection of  American  manufactures  and  industry." 

In  1831  Gen.  McCarty  was  elected  to  Congress 
from  his  district,  defeating  his  former  competitors. 
Judge  Test,  and  Oliver  H.  Smith.  The  General  was 
a  supporter  of  the  administration  and  the  election 
terminated  an  unusually  heated  canvass.  During  the 
canvass  Samuel  W.  Parker,  who  was  then  editing  the 
Political  Clarion,  and  who,  it  will  be  borne  in  mind, 
was  opposed  to  the  election  of  the  General,  thus 
alluded  to  him  in  that  paper:  "Gen.  McCarty  for 
four  or  five  years  had  particular  notoriety  as  a  heated 
partisan  of  President  Jackson.  As  a  man  he  is  pos- 
sessed of  natural  abilities  which  rate  considerably 
above  mediocrity,  abilities  which  could  not  but  have

rendered  him  truly  and  justly  consijicuous,  had  they 
been  properly  disciplined  and  directed.  From  village 
to  national  politics,  he  is  shrewd,  calculating,  artful 
and  indefatigable,  and  in  his  demeanors  he  is  affable, 
courteous  and  interesting.  *         *         *     " 

Gen.  MeCarty  served  his  district  in  Congress 
from  1831  to  1837,  and  in  1848  or  1849  remove.!  to 
Keokuk,  Iowa,  with  the  intention  of  there  practicing 
his  profession.  He  was  twice  married,  the  first  time 
to  Miss  Desdemona  Harrison,  who  died  during  their 
residence  at  Fort  Wayne;  and  the  second  wife  was 
Elizabeth  Parsons.  His  death  occurred  at  Keokuk, 
Iowa,  where  rest  his  remains,  in  about  the  year 
1852. 

Oliver  H.  Smith,  in  his  "Reminiscences,"  remarks 
of  him,  "He  was  one  of  the  most  talenied  men  in  the 
State.  He  was  defective  in  education,  but  had  great 
native  powers;  represented  his  district  in  Congress 
for  several  years  with  ability.  As  a  stump  speaker 
he  was  ardent  and  effective;  his  person  was  above 
the  medium  size;  his  head  and  face  of  line  mould; 
his  voice  strong  and  clear,  and  his  actions  good." 

CALEB    B.   SMITH. 

This  distinguished  man  was  born  in  the  city  of 
Boston,  Mass.,  April  16,  1808,  and  at  about  the  age 
six  years  his  parents  removed  to  Cincinnati,  Ohio, 
in  which  city  he  grew  up  and  there  gathered  most  of 
the  associations  of  his  boyhood.  At  the  age  of  fif- 
teen he  entered  the  Cincinnati  College,  where  he,  for 
a  period,  pursued  his  studies,  then  was  sent  to  the 
more  extended  and  celebrated  institution  of  Miami 
University,  at  Oxford,  Ohio.  He  entered  the  uni- 
versity in  1825  and  remained  until  1827.  On  leaving 
college  he  returned  to  Cincinnati,  and  there  at  once 
commenced  reading  law.  In  the  fall  of  1827  he 
removed  to  Connersville  and  there  resumed  the  study 
of  law  under  Oliver  H.  Smith,  who  thus  alludes  to 
the  first  introduction: 

"One  day  I  was  sitting  in  my  office  at  Conners- 
ville, when  there  entered  a  small  youth  about  five 
feet,  eight  inches  high,  large  head,  thin  brown  hair, 
light  blue  eyes,  high,  capacious  forehead,  and  good 
features,  and  introduced  himself  as  Caleb  B.  Smith, 
of  Cincinnati.  He  stated  his  business  in  a  lisping 
tone.  He  had  come  to  read  law  with  me  if  I  would 
receive  him.  I  assented  to  his  wishes,  and  he  re- 
miiiaed  with  me  until  he  was  admitted  to  practice, 
aud  commenced  his  professional,  as  well  as  his  polit- 
ical, career  at  Connersville.  He  rose  rapidly  at  the 
bar,  was  remarkably  fluent,  rapid  and  eloquent  before 
a  jury,  never  at  a  loss  for  ideas  or  words  to  express 
them;  if  he  had  a  fault  as  an  advocate,  it  was  that  he 
suffered  his  nature  to  press  forward  his  ideas  for 
utterance  faster  than  the  minds  of  the  jurors  were 


prepared  to  receive   thom.      Still,   he  was  very   suc- 
cessful before  the  court  and  jury." 

He  completed  his  law  studies  and  began  practice 
in  the  fall  of  1828.  Three  years  later,  (1831)  at  the 
age  of  twenty-three,  he  made  the  race  for  Representa- 
tive from  the  county  in  the  General  Assembly,  but 
was  defeated.  In  June,  1832,  he,  in  connection  with 
Matthew  R.  Hull,  established  at  Connersville  a 
weekly  newspaper  styled  the  Indiana  Sentinel,  the 
first  of  its  name.  The  paper  was  spirited  and  con- 
ducted with  marked  ability.  It  supported  Henry 
Clay  for  President.  In  May,  1833,  Mr.  Smith  with- 
drew from  the  paper  and  was  that  same  year  elected 
to  the  Legislature  and  re-elected  in  1834.  The  great 
question  of  internal  improvement  was  now  agitating 
the  minds  of  the  country,  and  for  the  system  young 
Smith  took  an  active  part;  also  for  Gov.  Noble,  the 
champion  of  it  In  1835  he  was  sent  to  Washington 
by  the  Governoj'  to  obtain  from  the  War  Depart- 
ment an  order  detailing  Col.  Stansbury  and  a  corps  of 
engineers  to  survey  the  routes  of  some  or  all  of  the 
great  projected  lines  of  canals  and  railroads  which 
it  was  in  contemplation  to  construct,  and  determine 
their  practicability.  On  returning  to  Connersville 
he  was  again  elected  to  the  Legislature,  and  in  the 
following  December  was  elected  Speaker  of  the 
House  on  the  first  ballot. 

That  session  the  great  Internal  Improvement  Bill 
was  passed. 

In  1836  he  was  again  chosen  Speaker,  making  the 
second  time  he  had  been  elected  to  this  position 
before  he  had  attained  the  early  age  of  twenty-eight 
years.  For  several  years  he  was  one  of  the  Fund 
Commissioners  for  Indiana. 

In  1840  he  was  again  elected  to  the  Legislature, 
it  being  the  fifth  time  he  had  been  so  honored  by  his 
adopted  county.  He  was  made  Chairman  of  the 
Committee  on  Canals,  That  same  year  he  was  one 
of  the  Presidential  Electors  on  the  Harrison  ticket. 
In  1841  he  ran  for  Congress,  but  was  defeated. 
The  Whigs  running  two  candidates  suffered  defeat, 
Andrew  Kennedy,  their  competitor,  being  elected. 
Two  years  later  Mr.  Smith  was  elected  to  Congress, 
and  in  1845  was  re  elected,  and  again  re-elected  in 
1847. 

"In  these  three  terms  he  made  himself  the  fore- 
most man  of  the  Indiana  Delegation,  and  at  the  close 
was  probably  not  only  the  most  prominent  man  in 
national  affairs  from  the  State,  but  the  most  promi- 
nent man  who  had  ever  represented  it." 

Oliver  H.  Smith  in  making  fui-ther  reference  to 

the   subject  says:  "  He  stood  high  in  Congress  as  a 

:  member  and  eloquent  speaker.      He  was   one  of  the 

most  eloquent   and  powerful   stump-speakers  in  the 

j  United  States,  a  warm  and  devoted  Whig;  was  on  the

commission,  after  he  left  Congress,  with  Corwin  and 
Payne,  under  the  Mexican  treaty.  Few  men  in  the 
West  have  filled  a  larger  space  in  the  public  eye." 

In  1851  he  removed  to  the  city  of  Cincinnati,  and 
was  elected  President  of  the  Cincinnati  &amp;  Chicago 
Eailroad  Company.  The  project  proved  ruinous  and 
Mr.  Smith  became  deeply  involved.  In  1856  he  be- 
came an  elector  for  Ohio  on  the  Fremont  ticket.  In 
1859  he  severed  his  connection  with  the  railroad  and 
removed  to  Indianapolis,  resuming  the  practice  of  his 
profession.  He  was  made  Chairman  of  the  Indiana 
delegation  at  the  Chicago  Convention  in  1860,  and 
contributed  greatly  to  the  success  of  Abraham  Lin- 
coln, seconding  in  his  nomination  with  twenty  sis 
votes  from  Indiana.  He  was  an  Elector  for  the  State 
at  Large  on  the  Republican  ticket. 

His  vigorous  campaign  made  for  the  martyred 
President  was  recognized  in  his  being  made  Mr.  Lin- 
coln's Secretary  of  the  Interior.  He  resigned  his  pos- 
ition in  the  cabinet  on  Christmas  Day,  1862,  to  accept 
the  Judgeship  of  the  United  States  Court  for  the  Dis- 
trict of  Indiana,  January  1,  1863. 

"As  a  Judge  he  was  courteous  to  a  degree  which  dis- 
armed partisan  bitterness  at  a  period  of  unusual  party 
exasperation,  and  his  fairness  was  so  evident  that 
there  coald  be  little  more  complaint  of  it  than  of  his 
demeanor.  It  was  chiefly  as  an  orator  and  especially 
as  a  popular  or  'stump'  orator  that  Mr.  Smith  ex- 
celled. Here  he  had  few  rivals.  His  voice  singular- 
ly clear,  sonorous  and  penetrating,  rarely  encount- 
ered a  crowd  that  could  exhaust  its  power  without 
obtaining  the  full  freight  of  thought  it  carried.  His 
language  was  copious  and  appropriate,  often  striking 
aud  always  clear,  and  his  style  though  affecting  little 
of  the  polished  elegance  of  the  pen,  was  rarely  sloven- 
ly or  feeble.  He  possessed  the  ability  to  argue  a  prop- 
osition  convincingly." 

This  citizen,  orator,  statesman  and  Judge  of  dis- 
tinction died  in  the  court  building  at  Indianapolis, 
Ind.,the  17th  of  January,  1804  The  circumstances  of 
his  death  as  announced  in  the  Indianapolis  Journal 
of  January  8,  1864,  were  as  follows: 

"He  left  home  in  the  morning  with  his  son  to  at- 
tend court,  which  was  in  session,  and  appeared  to  be  in 
his  usual  health,  which,  however,  for  some  months 
past  has  not  been  very  robust.  On  arriving  at  the 
court  house  he  went  into  his  private  room  to  rest  a 
few  minutes  before  opening  court,  and  while  sitting 
before  the  tire  was  seized  with  a  fit  of  coughing  which 
in  some  unexplained  way  ruptured  a  blood  vessel  and 
caused  a  profuse  and  almost  choking  flow  of  blood. 
He  was  alone  at  the  time,  but  in  a  few  minutes  Post- 
master Conner  entered  the  room  and  discovering  the 
condition  of  the  Judge,  notified  those  who  could  best 
assist  in  the  matter  and  had  him  removed  to  the  bed  in 


the  private  office  of  District  Attorney  Hanna.  Drs. 
Jameson  and  Wright  were  called  in,  and  the  utmost 
efforts  of  these  experienced  physicans  were  directed  to 
the  stopping  of  the  flow  of  blood.  They  succeeded 
partially,  but  not  till  more  than  a  gallon  had  been 
thrown  up,  and  the  patient  fearfully  if  not  fatally,  re- 
duced in  strength  and  vital  energy.  After  the  check- 
ing of  the  hemorrhage  the  Judge  remained  calm,  and, 
it  was  hoped,  in  a  condition  which  rendered  recovery 
possible.  But  late  in  the  afternoon  a  paroxysm  of 
coughing  seized  him  again  and  ,renewed  the  hemor- 
rhage, and  attacking  a  system  already  reduced,  speedi- 
ly rendered  death  inevitable.  Some  time  before  dark 
it  was  considered  certain  that  he  could  not  live 
through  the  night,  and  those  unhappy  fears  were  re- 
alized too  soon,  as  his  condition  made  it  impossible 
to  move  him." 

At  the  death  of  Judge  Smith  it  was|ordered  by 
the  President  of  the  United  States  that  the  Executive 
Building  at  the  seat  of  Government  be  draped  in 
mourning  for  fourteen  days,  "in  honor  of  him  as  a 
prudent  and  loyal  counselor,  and  faithful  and  effec- 
tive coadjutor  of  the  Administration  in  an  hour  of 
public  difficulty  and  peril." 

The  wife  of  Judge  Smith  was  Elizabeth  B.  Wat- 
ton,  of  Connersville,  Ind.,  to  whom  he  was  united  in 
marriage  July  8,  1831. 

SAMUEL    W.     PARKER. 

A  walk  of  fifteen  minutes-  to  the  south  of  Con- 
nersville conveys  one  to  the  "Old  Elm  Farm,"  a 
beautiful  and  picturesque  suburban  or  country  seat — • 
long  the  home  of  men  of  distinction.  Back  of  and 
above  this  homestead  on  the  brow  of  a  towering  hill 
overshadowed  by  a  cluster  of  evergreens  and  the  more 
lofty  forest  trees  which  crown  and  fringe  the  sur- 
rounding ridge,  is  nestled  the  grave  of  Samuel  W. 
Parker,  to  whose  memory  has  been  ascribed  by  a 
United  States  Senator,  a  place  among  the  first  law- 
yers of  his  time. 

Of  the  ancestors  of  Samuel  W.  Parker  little  defi- 
nite knowledge  is  known.  His  father,  Samuel  Par- 
ker, was  a  native  of  the  State  of  Vermont.  Said 
Samuel  W. :  "I  have  induced  myself  to  believe  that 
■my  paternal  ancestors  were  from  England,  more, 
however,  from  the  name  than  anything  else."  The 
mother  of  Samuel  W.  was  Elizabeth  Miller,  a  native 
of  Massachusetts,  the  ancestors  of  whom  our  subject 
believed  to  be  of  German  extraction.  At  an  early 
age  both  parents  with  their  parents  immigrated  to 
New  York,  and  were  married  in  Jefferson  County, 
October  20,  1803,  in  a  town  called  Champion.  They 
lived  in  Watertown  until  in  August,  1805,  on  the 
2d  day  of  which  month  the  husband  died  and  was 
there  interred.     He  was  a  carpenter  by  trade,  and  a

worthy  young  man.  The  subject  of  this  sketch  was 
his  only  child,  and  his  birth  occurred  one  month  and 
seven  days  after  the  father's  decease. 

"At  the  age  of  one  year  and  six  months,"  said 
our  subject,  "I  was  adopted  by  one  of  the  most  kind 
and  affectionate  step-fathers  that  ever  orphan  boy  was 
blessed  with."  This  was  Joseph  Wadley,  who  was 
born  on  the  same  day  with  Mr.  Parker's  own  father, 
and  he,  too,  was  a  carpenter  by  trade.  He  owned  a 
farm  on  Stony  Creek  near  Sacketts  Harbor,  where  he 
had  built  a  flouring-mill;  and  in  this  vicinity,  at  the 
age  of  about  four  years,  in  a  little  log  schoolhouse, 
young  Parker  took  his  iniatory  steps  in  schooling. 
From  1811  to  1815  Mr.  Wadley  and  family  resided 
in  and  about  Bloomfield,  in  Ontario  County,  of  the 
same  State,  during  which  period,  and  when  not  more 
than  nine  years  of  age,  little  Sam  was  often  entrusted 
with  a  team  of  a  wagon  and  two  horses  in  the  con- 
veyance of  brick  to  the  neighboring  town  of  Canan- 
daigua,  being  assisted  only  in  the  loading  of  them. 

In  1815  the  family  immigrated  to  Cincinnati,Ohio, 
and  there  and  in  that  vicinity  remained  until  1818, 
when  they  settled  at  Oiford,  Ohio,  during  which  pe- 
riod our  subject  at  different  times  attended  the 
Lancastran  Seminary,  superintended  respectively  by 
Harrison  and  Cathcart,  during  a  portion  of  which 
attendance  the  school  numbered  from  200  to  500  pu- 
pils, over  whom  young  Parker  acted  as  general  mon- 
itor. 

It  seems  that  Mr.  Wadley  was  very  anxious  to  give 
his  children  a  good  education,  and  especially  the  step- 
son, often  remarking  to  him  that  he  never  expected 
to  be  able  to  give  him  anything  else,  and  at  all  events 
that  would  be  the  best  fortune  that  could  be  given 
him.  So  it  was  mainly  this  object  that  directed  him 
to  Oxford,  from  the  prospect  of  an  excellent  insti- 
tution of  learning  there.  At  this  village  young  Par- 
ker first  attended  a  common  school  about  one  year, 
in  which  reading,  spelling  and  history  alone  were 
studied.  He  subsequently  attended  a  grammar  school 
then  just  opened  by  the  Rev.  James  Hughes,  under 
the  charge  of  the  Trustees  of  the  University — the 
first  germ  of  the  future  college.  Here  he  began  the 
study  of  the  languages — Latin  and  Greek — and  here 
were  made  his  first  efforts  at  declamation;  and  on  the 
latter  he  remarks :  '  'I  succeeded  well,  was  fond  of  the 
exercise,  and  soon  ranked  among  the  best  declaimers 
in  the  institution.  At  several  public  exhibitions  the 
laurels  wej-e  won  by  me;  and  many  a  vision  of  glory 
did  these  laurels  excite  in  my  young  imagination. 
"Here,  too,  my  fir.st  attempts  at  composition  were 
made.  In  this  I  did  not  succeed  so  well.  It  was  a 
tame  exercise  when  contrasted  with  spouting  forth 
the  eloquent  thoughts  of  the  Roman,  English  and 
American  orators.     In  this  branch,  however,   I  stood 


about  equal  to  my  fellows.  But  little  attention  was 
then  directed  to  composition;  declamation  swallowed 
up  all,  and  when  the  Trustees  of  the  institution,  on  a 
public  examination  and  exhibition  day,  pronounced 
me  the  best  declaimer  in  the  institution,  I  deemed 
myself  a  man  of  full  proportions,  though  it  seems 
that,  in  reality,  I  was  but  a  stripling  of  but  fifteen 
years." 

After  Mr.  Wadley's  arrival  in  this  city  on  immigrat- 
ing thither,  he  was  soon  engaged  in  bridge-building 
and  other  carpenter  work,  and  during  a  part  of  his 
stay  in  the  vicinity,  he  was  engaged  at  Mt.  Pleasant 
in  building  flat-boats,  termed  "Broad  Horns,"  and 
while  in  and  about  the  city,  fishing  and  swimming 
seemed  to  be  a  favorite  sport  of  the  young  step-son, 
as  he  speaks  of  frequently  amusing  himself  with  other 
lads  in  swimming  and  bathing  in  the  river,  and  div- 
ing from  and  under  the  boats,  etc.,  etc.,  and  later  on 
at  Oxford,  ball  was  a  pleasant  pastime  to  him. 

The  late  summer  and  early  fall  of  1821  have  been 
pronounced  by  him  as  the  halcyon  days  of  his  life. 
Nearly  three  months  of  his  time  were  passed  on  a  visit 
to  an  uncle  who  resided  near  North  Bend,  on  the 
Ohio.  His  uncle  kept  a  large  dairy,  and  the  visitor 
assisted  in  attending  to  the  cows,  milking,  making 
butter  and  cheese,  and  going  to  the  Cincinnati  market 
and  sporting  through  the  neighboring  country.  The 
following  incident  occurring  on  this  visit  from  its 
connection  with  so  distinguished  a  man  is  worthy  of 
note,  and  is  given  in  the  language  of  the  participant 
himself  in  after  years: 

"  Whilst  at  North  Bend,  on  one  fine  summer  day 
several  of  the  neighbor  boys  and  myself  went  down 
to  the  river  at  Gen.  Harrison's  farm  to  swim.  Whilst 
there  we  noticed  the  tempting  looks  of  the  fruit  in 
the  General's  orchard — and  the  temptation  was  too 
strong  to  withstand.  Accordingly  we  entered  the  en- 
closure and  commenced  our  assaults  upon  it.  Having 
pretty  well  filled  our  pockets,  we  commenced  a  retreat, 
and,  as  we  were  getting  back  over  the  fence,  we 
espied  the  old  hero  himself,  leaping  his  garden  fence, 
bounce  into  the  orchard  and  make  toward  us.  Though 
some  three  hundred  yards  distant,  his  manner  very 
plainly  indicated  that  he  had  some  designs  upon  those 
who  had  just  gratified  their  designs  upon  his  fruit. 
We  accordingly  made  a  hasty  retreat  to  the  river, 
jumped  into  a  canoe  lying  at  the  shore,  and  had  but 
cleverly  got  our  canoe  out  of  his  reach  when  "Old 
Tip  "  was  at  the  water's  edge.  He  assumed  a  most 
furious  attitude;  his  eyes  seemed  to  flash  javelins  into 
our  bosoms,  and  his  curses  were  withering.  He  bade 
us  instantly  back  to  the  shore  or  he  would  have  the 
Constable  after  us — and  whole  troop  of  young  thieves 
in  jail  before  sun  down.  To  disobey  was  impossible, 
and  our  pockets  were  full  of  what  must  be  our  con-

demnatioQ.  We  accordingly  commenced  plying  the 
paddle  for  the  shore,  and  in  the  meantime  also  busied 
ourselves  in  stealthily  slipping  overboard  all  the  fruit 
that  could  not  be  easily  concealed.  We  landed,  and 
I  stepped  forward  as  spokesman.  I  observed  that  we 
had  come  down  to  the  river  to  swim.  We  saw  the 
haw  tree  just  inside  the  orchard  fence,  and  think- 
ing it  no  harm  to  take  a  few  hawa  from  it,  we  accord- 
ingly got  over  and  did  so, — and  suiting  _the  action  to 
the  word  I  pulled  from  my  breeches  pocket  a  few 
haws  that  happened  to  be  there,  and  displayed  them 
as  proof  of  our  innocence.  A  most  benignant  smile 
came  over  the  old  soldier's  swarthy  features.  'Ah,' 
said  he,  boys,  if  that  is  all  the  mischief  you  have 
done,  come  up  here  with  me  and  get  some  of  my  apples. 
I  have  some  very  fine  ones  yet,  if  the  boatmen  have 
not  stolen  them  all  off.  Any  body  is  welcome  to  my 
fruit  so  long  as  it  lasts,  if  they  will  only  come  and 
ask  me  for  it — but  d  —  n  a  thief.  I  hate  them.'  And 
this  was  my  first  interview  with  that  patriot  soldier, 
and  honest  man,  who,  when  he  died,  the  Nation 
mourned  in  tears — because  the  '  good  President '  had 
fallenl  He  then  as  little  thought  of  being  President 
as  I  did  of  the  after  service  of  two  years  and  a  half 
at  the  head  of  a  newspaper,  advocating  his  preten- 
sions." 

Up  until  the  fall  of  1824,  when  Miami  University 
was  regularly  opened,  young  Sam  attended  for  a  time 
the  grammar  school  heretofore  mentioned  as  started 
by  Mr.  Hughes,  which  had  been  discontinued  on 
the  death  of  that  gentleman,  but  which  was  re- 
opened by  Eev.  Spencer  Clark,  and  a  common 
school  in  the  village  taught  by  Abner  Philbrick. 
During  the  spring,  summer,  and  fall  of  this  last 
mentioned  year  he  worked  on  a  farm  rented  by  his 
step-father  in  the  vicinity  of  Oxford,  which  was  the 
only  regular  year's  manual  labor  that  he  ever  per- 
formed. 

In  January,  1825,  he  entered  the  institution  as  a 
free  scholar,  under  provisions  that  had  been  made  for 
five  young  men  of  merit.'  The  limited  circumstances 
of  this  step-father  compelled  him  to  take  advantage 
of  such  provisions,  and  enter  thus  or  not  at  all.  On 
this  point  Mr.  Parker  says,  "  It  was  rather  humiliat- 
ing to  my  proud  spirit,  but  the  goodness  of  the  cause 
and  a  firm  determination  to  rise  above  it,  reconciled 
my  feelings  to  the  sacrifice." 

His  four  years'  course  in  Miami  University,  from 
the  beginning  to  the  day  of  graduation,  was  a  suc- 
cession of  brilliant  intellectual  triumphs;  term  after 
term  and  year  after  year  he  was  the  recipient  of 
compliments  and  high  honors  at  the  hands  of  his  class- 
mates and  of  the  Faculty.  He  entered  the  university 
as  a  freshman,  and  at  the  close  of  the  first  session 
was  selected,  with  one  other  class-mate,  to  deliver  an 


original  oration;  theme.  Patriotism  and  some  of 
the  events  of  the  American  Revolution.  From  the 
beginning  he  attracted  attention  as  a  speaker,  and 
continued  to  occupy  a  position  in  this  respect  second 
to  none  connected  with  the  institution.  Before  the 
close  of  the  year,  in  addition  to  his  studies  he  took 
charge  of  a  class  in  the  grammar  school,  in  part,  and 
in  this  way  got  ofi"  of  the  charity  list.  At  the  close 
of  the  second  session  he  was  selected  to  deliver  the 
oration  introductory  to  the  exhibition. 

In  December,  1825,  was  organized  the  Union 
Literary  Society  of  the  Miami  University,  of  which 
he  was  one  of  the  founders,  and  over  which  he  sub- 
sequently presided.  After  the  organization  of  this 
society,  young  Parker  from  the  first  took  a  stand  as 
an  extemporaneous  debater  and  declaimer  amongst 
the  most  prominent  members,  which  station  he 
retained  until  his  graduation.  Says  Parker:  "The 
most  formidable  antagonist  I  ever  met  in  debate  in 
the  society,  was  Robert  C.  Schenck,  of  Ohio,  and  so 
the  strongest  will  say  who  encounter  him."  Dur- 
ing his  remaining  years  in  the  institution  he  was 
closely  identified  with  the  interests  of  this  society, 
and  was  on  several  occasions  highly  complimented 
in  the  bestowal  of  honors  by  it  upon  him  in  public 
exercises,  among  which  was  his  unanimous  election 
to  prepare  a  report  upon  the  Rise,  Progress  and 
Present  Condition  and  Future  Prospects  of  the  Soci- 
ety, and  deliver  an  address  on  the  occasion,  which 
he  accepted  and  performed  in  a  manner  that  was 
highly  gratifying  to  the  society  and  to  the  public. 

In  1828  the  Faculty  and  students  of  the  university 
formed  themselves  into  a  society  auxiliary  to  the 
American  Colonization  Society,  in  Washington, 
D.,  C,  and  Parker  was  by  them  appointed  to  deliver 
a  public  address  on  the  4:th  of  July,  1828,  on  the 
colonization  system,  held  in  the  college  chapel  in 
conjunction  with  a  celebration  of  the  citizens  of 
Oxford.  The  orator  was  James  Crawford.  Mr. 
Parker  spoke  for  nearly  an  hour,  and  the  speech  won 
him  much  applause.  Many  of  the  auditors  expressed 
a  desire  to  have  the  address  published  in  pamphlet 
form.  At  the  dinner  table  a  complimentary  toast 
was  drank  to  the  "orators  of  the  day." 

Commencement  Day  came,  and  with  it  found 
the  already  distinguished  young  Parker  facing  a 
great  concourse  of  people,  among  whom  were  per- 
sonages of  culture  and  distinction,  with  a  theme  for 
graduation  of  "Symmes'  Theory  of  Concentric 
Spheres."  As  a  speaker  on  this  occasion,  Parker  was 
unanimously  voted  the  chief;  said  Dr.  Slack,  then 
the  distinguished  chemical  professor  in  the  Cincin- 
nati College,  commenting  on  the  speech  that  he  "did 
not  think  Capt.  Symmes  himself  could  have  pre- 
sented his  theory  in  a  manner  more  happy  and  im-

pressive."  Says  the  speaker,  "This  effort  was  of  no 
little  service  to  me.  It  gave  me  a  celebrity  through 
the  country  which  college  efforts  seldom  acquire,  and 
it  was  the  means  of  introducing  me  to  several  gen- 
tlemen of  intelligence  and  reputation."  To  the  dis- 
satisfaction of  many  of  the  students  and  some  of  the 
Faculty  in  the  assignment  of  class  honors,  Parker  was 
given  the  third  place.  His  fi'iends  claimed  for  him 
the  second  if  not  the  first  honors.  The  second  place 
was  given  to  the  son  of  Dr.  Bishop,  the  President  of 
the  University.  On  the  evening  of  September  24, 
1828,  a  commencement  ball  was  given  at  Apple's  Inn, 
in  Oxford,  of  which  young  Parker  was  manager,  and 
says  he:  "It  was  the  first  ball  I  had  ever  attended,  and 
I  believe  I  may  say  the  first  social  party  of  any  kind, 
though  then  twenty-three  years  old.  I  had  been  a 
student  the  most  of  my  days,  and  a  close  one  too;  I 
did  not  lose  a  half  dozen  recitations  during  the  whole 
four  years  of  my  college  course."  Mr.  Parker  acted 
as  a  tutor  during  the  greater  portion  of  his  time  in 
college. 

Until  his  graduation  the  most  of  his  days  were 
passed  in  school,  yet  when  out  of  school  and  during 
mornings  and  evenings  and  vacations  he  was  accus- 
tomed to  do,  and  did  do,  almost  all  kinds  of  manual 
labor;  this  the  circumstances  of  the  family  required, 
and  it  was  most  cheerfully  complied  with,  in  a  just 
appreciation  of  the  assistance  and  love  borne  him  by 
his  step-father.  "In  fact,"  said  our  subject,  "I  have 
done  a  little  of  everything,  almost,  in  my  time,  for 
the  sake  of  being  handy  in  aid  of  my  step-father." 
To  further  show  the  great  esteem  and  appreciation 
held  by  him  for  this  father,  we  quote  his  own  words: 
"The  kind  attention  and  essential  services  always 
rendered  me  by  my  most  excellent  step-father  never 
recur  to  my  mind  without  filling  my  bosom  with  sen- 
sations of  gratitude  almost  painful.  Would  to 
heaven  that  good  old  man  could  have  lived  that  I 
might  return  to  him  some  of  the  ten  thousand  kind- 
nesses in  the  evening  of  his  days  that  he  bestowed 
upon  me  in  the  morning  of  mine." 

Soon  after  the  graduation  of  Mr.  Parker  he  set- 
tled in  the  village  of  Connersville,  and  in  November 
opened  a  private  or  subscription  school,  which  he 
taught  several  terms,  and  in  the  following  May  secured 
the  Principalship  of  the  county  seminary,  then  just 
being  completed,  and  in  July  opened  the  first  school 
in  that  building.  He  was  here  engaged  in  teaching 
until  the  close  of  a  term  of  school  in  April,  1830, 
when  he  resigned  the  position. 

Early  in  the  year  1829  he  began  writing  edito- 
rially for  the  Fayette  Observer,  the  proprietor  and 
senior  editor  of  which  was  Daniel  Rench,  and  soon 
thereafter  the  editorial  charge  of  the  paper  was  given 
him,  and  in  February,   1830,  Mr.  Parker  became  in 


a  manner  the  proprietor.  New  type,  etc.,  was  pro- 
cured, and  Mr.  Parker  sent  forth  to  the  country  the 
first  issue  of  the  newspaper  titled  the  Political  Clar- 
ion, ]\Iay  22,  1830,  which  was  continued  two  years 
and  edited  with  marked  ability,  such  as  called  forth 
a  complimentary  letter  from  Henry  Clay,  whom  he 
vigorously  supported  for  the  chief  magistracy.  The 
young  editor  was  honored  by  calls  from  the  Governor, 
Senator  Noble,  and  Judge  Test,  then  Representative 
in  Congress  from  the  Connersville  District,  and  his 
importance  seemed  great.  We  extract  the  following 
from  an  editorial  in  the  Clarion  of  April  30,  1831: 

"In  this  village  we  first  commenced  in  the  bus- 
iness of  the  world.  We  have  formed  friendly  associa- 
tions here,  which  we  wish  not  to  sunder.  Here  we  first 
looked  out  over  the  land  for  ourselves,  and  beheld 
wicked  men  treading  down  the  virtuous,  corruption 
vitiating  the  undefiled,  creeping  into  the  councils 
and  Cabinet  of  the  Republic,  and  threatening  a  gen- 
eral deluge  — the  precedents,  the  laws,  and  the  consti- 
tution which  came  to  us  from  hallowed  bands  spurned 
and  violated — anarchy  and  confusion  smothering  the 
voice  of  honest  men  and  justice — all  the  vile  princi- 
ples of  our  nature  kindling  into  a  blaze,  catching 
upon  the  vitals  of  our  Government  and  freedom,  and 
blown  upon  us  as  it  were  by  the  breath  of  the  hurri- 
cane. Hence  we  believe  sprang  at  least  some  of  the 
incentives  that  induced  us  to  stay  here,  to  enlist  under 
the  banner  that  we  have  here,  and  however  faint  and 
unavailing  the  efforts  might  be,  to  prepare  for  a  strug- 
gle in  the  conflict  here,  until  we  fail  or  it  be  over. 
None  of  oiur  ardor  is  or  will  be  abated.  Our  course 
is  on,  right  on,  until  our  Republican  institutions,  the 
American  system  and  Henry  Clay  are  overwhelmed, 
or  rise  and  triumph  together  on  the  4th  of  March, 
1833." 

From  the  very  beginning  Mr.  Parker  had  deter- 
mined upon  adopting  the  law  as  his  profession,  and 
with  this  view  on  opening  his  first  school  in  Conners- 
ville he  put  in  odd  hours  reading  Blackstone  in  the 
ofiice  of  Oliver  H.  Smith,  but  it  was  soon  thought  by 
the  patrons  of  his  school  and  others,  that  he  could 
not  do  the  two  things  at  the  same  time,  and  the  law 
was  soon  temporarily  dropped,  and  not  again  taken 
up  until  during  the  latter  half  of  the  first  year  he 
was  publishing  the  Clarion.  He  studied  in  all  about 
six  months,  and  we  may  say  without  any  instruction, 
he  was  admitted  to  the  bar  in  August,  1831,  having 
been  first  examined  at  Brookville,  by  Judge  Miles  C. 
Eggleston,  August  6,  and  his  license  signed,  and  the 
examination  completed  August  22,  before  a  commit- 
tee of  lawyers  at  the  Wayne  Circuit  Court,  which 
committee  reported  favorably,  and  the  license  was 
perfected  by  the  signature  of  Judge  Test.  The  day 
following  he  made  his  maiden  speech  to  a  jury  in

assisting  James  Perry,  the  Prosecutor,  in  the  prose- 
cution of  a  defendant  charged  with  refusing  to  aid  a 
Constable  to  execute  proceedings. 

In  1834  Mr.  Parker  established  the  Watclmian,  a 
weekly  paper,  which  he  continued  until  after  the 
close  of  the  Presidential  election  in  1836,  advocating 
with  great  zeal  the  election  to  the  Presidency  of  Will- 
iam Henry  Harrison.  In  1833  he  made  the  race  for 
Representative  in  the  Legislature  from  the  county  of 
Fayette,  but  was  defeated;  however,  seven  years  later 
he  was  elected  to  that  position.  The  following  year 
he  was  elected  to  the  State  Senate  and  served  one 
term,  when  he  was  again  chosen  a  Representative  in 
the  Legislature. 

In  1836  he  was  appointed  Prosecuting  Attorney 
for  the  circuit,  and  during  his  service  in  that  capac- 
ity, remarked  the  Rev.  James  Havens  at  his  funeral, 
"  he  did  more  for  the  morality  in  this  part  of  the 
State  in  ferreting  out  and  suppressing  vice  and  crime 
than  any  man  then  living."  He  traversed  the  State  in 
in  1840,  1844,  1848,  1852  and  1856,  and  was  champion 
Whig  of  the  Whitewater  Valley.  Says  Gen.  Thomas 
Bennett:  "He  was  a  zealous  partisan  of  unwavering 
fidelity,  never  flinching  from  any  responsibility  im- 
posed upon  him  by  the  party  of  his  choice.  He  took 
the  great  Clay  for  his  model,  and  with  a  devotion 
amounting  to  almost  idolatry,  he  followed  his  chosen 
chieftain  while  he  lived,  and  when  he  died  he  lin- 
gered long  at  the  grave  of  the  gallant  old  Whig." 

In  1849  Mr.  Parker  was  elected  to  Congress  and 
served  two  terms  as  the  Whig  Representative  of  his 
district,  his  Congressional  career  closing  with  the 
Thirty-third  Congress  in  March,  1855.  He  could 
have  triumphantly  returned  to  the  seat  he  had  so  ably 
filled,  but  he  declined  a  renomiuation.  He  voted 
against  the  repeal  of  the  Missouri  Compromise  and 
on  the  subject  made  a  most  masterly  and  brilliant 
speech  which  won  him  high  compliments.  The  House 
being  in  the  Committee  on  the  Whole  on  the  State  of 
the  Union,  Mr.  Parker  said: 

"I  would  address  myself  gladly  on  this  occasion 
if  I  could,  to  all  my  fellow  citizens  of  the  South,  to 
all  of  the  North.  I  am  of  neither  the  North  nor 
South;  but  still  I  am  from  a  free  State — one  baptized 
as  such  and  sanctified,  I  hope,  by  the  glorious  ordi- 
nance of  1787,  in  which  I  think  I  have  cause  for  exul- 
tation— I  am  sure  I  have  still  greater  cause  in  the 
fact  that  I  come  here  from  the  great  Northwest. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  sometimes  contemplated 
that  marble  group,  at  once  beautiful  and  sublime, 
which  rests  upon  one  of  the  projections  of  the  eastern 
portico  of  this  Capitol,  and  thought  I  saw  a  patriotic 
embodiment  there,  which  probably  did  not  occur  to 
the  fervid  fancy  of  the  artist.  That  stalwart  pioneer 
with  gigantic  proportions,  a  brave  heart,  strong  hands 


and  the  bearing  of  a  hero,  is  no  inapt  representation 
of  that  section  of  this  confederacy  from  whence  I 
come.  See  how  he  holds  in  his  mighty  grasp,  harm- 
less as  an  unweaned  child,  those  two  savage  arms, 
one  pointing  South  and  the  other  North,  each  armed 
with  the  implements  of  death.  The  fond  mother  as 
she  bends  over  her  sleeping  child,  fears  no  evil;  and 
so  securely  are  they  protected,  that  the  watch-dog 
looks  kindly  on  !         *         *         *         *         *         * 

"  I  desire  no  concealment  of  my  opinion  in  regard 
to  the  institution  of  slavery.  I  look  upon  it  as  a 
great  evil,  and  deeply  lament  that  we  have  derived  it 
from  the  parental  Government,  and  from  our  ances- 
tors. But  here  they  are,  and  the  question  is,  how 
can  they  be  best  dealt  with  ?  If  a  state  of  nature  ex- 
isted and  we  were  about  to  lay  the  foundation  of  so- 
ciety no  man  would  be  more  strongly  opposed  than  I 
should  to  incorporate  the  institution  of  slavery  among 
the   elements. 

"  Sir,  that  is  precisely  the  work  on  which  we  are 
now  engaged.  Where  a  'state  of  nature'  now  exists; 
on  a  virgin  soil,  where  a  slave  never  trod  though  sav- 
ages have  roamed  there  from  the  '  primal  morn,'  we 
are  'about  to  lay  the  foundation  of  society'  for  the 
millions  of  civilized  and  Christian  people  that  will 
soon  congregate  there  for  a  home  forever  for  them- 
selves and  their  children.     W^hat  ought  we  to  do  ? 

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  ^it" 

Mr.  Parker  had  been  several  times  an  elector  from 
his  district  and  once  for  the  State  at  large;  and  says 
Gen.  Bennett,  "  He  contributed  to  the  success  of  his 
party  his  means,  his  talents  and  his  mighty  energies. 
He  shone  brightly  as  a  lawyer  and  statesman.  In  the 
beginning  he  took  an  eminent  pose  as  a  lawyer  and 
was  ranked  high  amongst  the  Whitewater  bar,  com- 
posed as  it  was  of  the  brightest  legal  minds  of  the 
State.  His  thrilling  eloquence,  his  bitter  sarcasm, 
his  quick  retort,  his  shrewd  ingenuity  in  the  manage- 
ment of  his  cause  soon  filled  his  office  with  clients 
and  rallied  around  him  troops  of  friends.  From  that 
time  he  was  a  giant  at  the  bar." 

After  the  close  of  Mr.  Parker's  Congressional  ca- 
reer he  was  engaged  in  the  practice  of  the  law  at 
Connersville  and  the  neighboring  courts,  and  resided 
on  the  Old  Elm  Farm,  heretofore  referred  to,  where 
his  death  occurred  from  pneumonia,  suddenly  and 
unexpectedly,  February  1,  1859.  At  this  time  he  was 
President  of  the  Junction  Railroad  Company,  and  had 
previously  for  years  been  President  of  the  White- 
water Canal  Company,  and  had  ever  been  intimately 
identified  with  all  the  great  improvements  which 
have  rendered  the  Whitewater  Valley  the  garden  spot 
of  Indiana.

Samuel  W.  Parker  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Indiana, 
Judge  Perkins  in  behalf  of  the  court  said: 

"With  deep  sensibility  does  the  court  receive 
these  testimonials  of  respect  to  the  memory  of  the 
late  Hon.  Samuel  W.  Parker.  Near  did  he  stand  to 
its  members,  near  in  age,  near  in  professional  associ- 
ation, near  in  social  companionship.  Valued  was  the 
relation.  INIr.  Parker  was  one  of  the  most  brilliant 
and  promising  men  of  the  State.  Gifted  with  a  mind 
of  high  order,  which  he  had  stored  with  solid  learn- 
ing, and  decorated  with  the  elegancies  of  ancient  and 
modern  literature — possessed  of  tine  oratorical  powers 
and  every  virtue  that  graces  social  life,  combined  with 
habits  of  great  industry,  it  could  not  be  otherwise 
that  he  should  reach  commanding  positions  at  the 
bar  and  in  the  councils  of  the  Nation.  The  death  of 
such  a  man,  at  whatsoever  time  it  may  happen,  can- 
not but  be  sorely  felt,  but  it  tills  us  with  a  deeper 
sadness  when  we  behold  him  stricken  down  in  the 
prima  of  manhood  and  in  the  middle  of  his  career 
and  fame.  *  *  *  *  *  " 

In  substance  the  Hon.  Oliver  H.  Smith  remarked 
of  Mr.  Parker,  that  he  was  a  ripe  scholar,  and  when 
he  first  saw  him  at  Gonnersville,  he  was  a  slim, 
flaxen-headed  stripling,  light  eyes  and  brows,  large 
white  forehead,  good  features,  head  erect,  the  step 
quick  and  firm.  He  rose  rapidly  at  the  bar  until  he 
stood  among  the  first  of  his  age.  He  was  clear, 
strong,  able  before  the  jury;  his  voice  was  of  great 
volume,  when  he  brought  it  up  to  its  full  pitch.  He 
always  threw  himself  bodily  into  the  cause  of  his 
client,  making  it  his  own.  On  the  stump,  as  a  pub- 
lic speaker,  he  stood  high  with  his  party;  few  men, 
of  his  age,  have  made  so  many  public  political 
speeches,  of  so  much  power.  While  in  Congress  he 
took  part  in  many  of  the  important  debates,  in  which 
he  placed  himself  among  the  best  of  the  speakers  of 
the  house. 

On  the  16th  of  July,  1834,  Mr.  Parker  was  united 
in  marriage  with  Susannah,  daughter  of  William 
Watton,  of  Connersville,  Ind.,  who  still  survives  him. 

JAMES    C.  m'iNTOSH. 

James  Cottingham  Mcintosh  was  born  in  Con- 
nersville, Ind.,  January  13,  1827,  of  parents,  Joshua 
and  Nancy  Mcintosh,  the  former  being  a  native  of 
the  State  of  Virginia  and  the  latter  of  Maryland.  In 
the  spring  of  1824  the  family  settled  in  Connersville. 
The  mother  was  a  devoted  Christian  ".woman,  and  the 
father  for  many  years  an  acceptable  local  preacher  in 
the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  The  latter  served 
as  one  of  the  Associate  Judges  of  the  county  in 
1847-51.  James  from  boyhood  was  carefully  and 
prayerfully  instructed  in  the  tests  and  principles  of 
Christianity.       He  early  indicated    strong   religious 


tendencies  and  in  January,  1844,  under  the  ministry 
of  W.  W.  Hibben,  he  united  with  the  Methodist 
Episcopal  Church.  His  early  youth  was  character- 
ized by  close  habits  of  study,  which  continued  through 
life.  His  close  application  to  study  seemed  to  be 
prompted  by  two  elevated  motives,  first  an  ardent  thir!;t 
for  knowledge,  and  secondly,  a  deeply  conscientious 
estimate  of  the  value  and  responsibility  of  time.  His 
early  education  was  obtained  in  the  schools  of  his 
native  village.  In  the  fall  of  1846  he  entered  Asbury 
University,  at  Greencastle,  Ind.,  from  which  institu- 
tion he  was  graduated  in  1849,  completing  the  col- 
lege curriculum  in  three  years,  and  that  brilliantly,  as 
he  carried  off  the  honors  of  a  very  strong  class. 

For  a  time  after  graduation  he  took  charge  of  a 
school  in  Lagrange,  Ind. ,  which  was  only  preparatory 
to  the  study  of  law,  which  he  commenced  in  1850, 
with  Hon.  S  W.  Parker,  of  Connersville.  Here  the 
same  zeal  and  devotion  to  his  books  characterized  him, 
as  had  previously  marked  his  course  in  the  school 
room  and  at  college.  In  1851  he  was  admitted  to  the 
bar.  Judge  Elliott  being  the  Presiding  Judge,  and  his 
own  father  occupying  a  seat  on  the  bench  as  one  of 
the  Associate  Judges.  He  was  subsequently  admitted 
to  practice  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  State. 

"  From  this  beginning  he  worked  his  way  upward 
in  his  profession  until  he  made  a  reputation  as  a 
lawyer  surpassed  by  a  very  few.  And  be  it  noted  that 
the  public  prominence  he  attained  was  as  a  lawyer — 
politics  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  He  never  asked 
for  office,  in  fact,  he  refused  to  allow  his  name  to  be 
used  in  that  connection,  and  while  many  of  his  asso- 
ciates in  the  State  have  left  their  names  to  be  tossed 
about  on  the  billows  of  politics,  he  quietly  toiled  on 
in  his  profession,  leaving  a  work  that  will  last  as  long 
as  jurisprudence  has  a  place  in  the  State  he  loved.'' 

His  biographer  says:  "His  devotion  to  his  legal 
studies  and  duties,  however,  had  no  effect  in  dimin- 
ishing his  religious  interest,  nor  did  it  then,  or  ever, 
interfere  in  the  slightest  degree  with  his  faithful  per- 
formance of  his  church  duties  Always  calm  and 
dignified,  never  demonstrative,  his  entire  Christian 
life  was  a  steady,  persistent  elevated  plea  for  the 
truth  of  Christian  doctrines,  the  purity  and  grandeur 
of  Christian  principles,  and  the  beauty  and  elevation 
of  Christian  character.  He  did  not  flash  with  the 
fitful  and  momeatary  glare  of  the  brilliant  meteor, 
but  glowed  with  the  steady  light  of  the  planet  that 
keeps  the  track  of  its  orbit. 

"Naturally,  he  was  not  self  assertive,  but  exceed- 
ingly reserved,  unobtrusive,  and  even  diffident;  noth- 
ing but  his  own  sense  of  duty  and  the  force  of  his 
own  personal  merits  ever  brought  him  to  the  front. 
His  will  force  was  a  dominant  power,  and  his  pur- 
pose was  an   uncompromising  fact.     Deliberate  and 


124 


HISTORY  OP  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


careful  in  making  up  his  judgment,  the  conclusion 
once  reached  was  generally  a  finality,  from  which 
there  was  no  appeal;  while  the  turning  aside  from 
deliberately  formed  purpose  was  a  thought  not  to  be 
entertained.  He  was  a  man  of  thorough  and  pains- 
taking research,  and  remarkable  for  the  accuracy  of 
his  knowledge.  From  his  legal  associates  I  learn 
that  this  was  characteristic  of  his  law  practice,  and  I 
know  it  to  have  been  true  of  his  Biblical  studies  and 
knowledge.  It  was  seldom  safe  to  question  a  position 
taken  by  him.  He  was  a  man  of  profound  sensibili- 
ties and  tender  affections." 

From  the  time  that  he  became  identified  with  the 
church  until  his  death,  he  was  by  example  and  coun- 
sel a  pillar  in  the  church.  He  was  a  prominent  del- 
egate to  the  General  Conference  in  Brooklyn,  N.  Y., 
in  1872,  and  for  many  years  prior  to  his  death  he  was 
one  of  the  Trustees  of  the  university,  of  which  he  was 
an  honored  alumnus. 

In  an  editorial  of  one  of  the  county  papers  at  the 
time  of  his  death  we  read:  "  At  the  bar  he  had  no 
superior.  He  was  acknowledged  by  all  the  most 
able."  During  his  obsequies  his  native  city  and  the 
surrounding  country  laid  aside  its  labors,  and  with 
one  accord  tendered  the  tribute  of  respect  due  to  his 
memory.  The  city  closed  its  business  houses.  In 
offering  the  resolutions  of  the  bar  on  his  death  the 
Hon.  B.  F.  Claypool,  the  oldest  practitioner  of  that 
body  said:  "It  has  been  my  fortune  to  have  known 
our  departed  brother  from  his  infancy,  and  for  more 
than  fifty  years  we  have  traveled  the  journey  of  life 
side  by  side.  We  met  upon  the  same  play-ground  of 
childhood,  in  the  school  room  of  youth,  schooled  in 
the  same  college,  fought  the  battles  of  the  profession 
side  by  side  in  the  same  arena  for  more  than  a  quar- 
ter of  a  century,  often  meeting  in  the  tierce  struggle 
of   debate  for  the  mastery,  and  not  unfrequently  the 


angry  and  violent  language  of  debate  seemed  to  arouse 
feelings  of  anger  that  would  not  subside,  but  as  we 
left  the  court  room,  we  left  behind  the  animosities  of 
the  conflict,  and  met  as  we  ever  had  met,  as  friends; 
and  it  is  a  pleasing  thought  to  know  that  at  the  close 
of  his  life  we  were  friends,  almost  brothers.  He  was 
possessed  of  an  ardent  and  sanguine  temperament, 
and  in  all  of  his  cases  he  threw  the  force  of  his  strong 
will  and  varied  learning.  Conscientious  in  the  dis- 
charge of  his  duty  to  his  client,  he  was  always  pre- 
pared. He  never  wearied  in  the  examination  of  his 
case  until  he  thoroughly  understood  it,  and  when  he 
came  into  court  he  was  fully  prepared  for  the  conflict. 
A  faithful  student  and  a  devoted  Christian,  he  fully 
realized  that  'life's  but  a  walking  shadow,'  and  that 
'the  veil  which  covers  the  face  of  futurity  is  woven 
by  the  hand  of  mercy,'  and  whenever  he  realized  that 
in  the  excitement  of  professional  contest  he  had  in  an 
unguarded  moment  wounded  the  feelings  of  a  brother, 
he  sought  the  earliest  opportunity  to  erase  all  harsh- 
ness and  bitterness  engendered  by  his  conduct.  For 
many  years  past  disease  was  preying  upon  him,  and 
at  times  he  seemed  very  irrascible,  yet  he  endeavored 
with  all  the  will  force  he  could  command  to  restrain 
his  temper,  treat  his  antagonist  with  propriety,  and 
keep  within  the  bounds  of  decorum,  for  he  felt  and 
fully  realized  that  'there  is  indeed  a  God,  that  sees 
and  hears  whate'er  we  do,'  and  to  that  God  he  was 
accountable  to  the  fullest  extent.  And  now  that  he 
has  gone  from  among  us,  and  will  no  longer  mingle 
in  the  strifes  and  contests  of  the  court,  let  us  forget 
his  foibles,  and  remember  only  his  virtues." 

The  death  of  Mr.  Mcintosh  occurred  in  the  even- 
ing of  August  27,  1878.  He  left  surviving  him  his 
wife,  Elizabeth  W.  (Martindale)  Mcintosh,  whom  he 
had  married  in  Indianapolis,  April  28,  1851,  and  five 
children.

THE  citizens  of  Fayette  County  will  ever  contem- 
plate with  great  pride,  and  hand  down  to  posterity 
the  record  of  her  soldiers,  and  the  honorable  part 
they  bore  in  the  great  struggle  of  1861-65,  for  the 
preservation  and  perpetuity  of  the  Union.  The  firing 
on  Sumter  seemed  an  individual  aim,  and  so  stirred 
the  patriotism  of  her  sturdy  yeomanry,  and  none  the 
less  patriotic  sons,  that  together  they  left  the  plow 
in  the  furrow,  and  side  by  side  came  father  and  son 
from  the  anvil,  the  accountant's  desk,  the  law  office 
and  the  workshop,  offering  their  lives  rather  than  see 
traitorous  hands  strike  death  to  the  flag  of  liberty — 
the  flag  representing  the  principles  of  our  fore- 
fathers, so  dearly  by  them  purchased  at  Valley  Forge, 
at  Bunker  Hill,  and  at  Yorktown. 

PUBLIC    SENTIMENT  AND    ACTION    IN    THE    BEGINNING. 

On  receipt  of  the  news  of  the  fall  of  Sumter,  the 
excitement  throughout  the  county  became  intense. 
Occupations  and  pursuits  were  almost  wholly  neg- 
lected, and  the  loyal  men  of  all  parties  announced 
their  readiness  to  follow  their  country's  call.  Con- 
nersville  was  thronged  with  an  excited  populace,  ask- 
ing for  the  latest  news  from  the  seat  of  war.  The 
following  extracts  are  taken  from  the  Connersville 
Times,  of  April  25,  1S61: 

"  The  greatest  enthusiasm  has  existed  here  during 
the  past  week.  Meetings  of  all  the  citizens  of  all 
parties  express  a  determination  to  aid  the  Government 
with  means  and  money  to  the  utmost  capabilities 
of   Fayette  County,  if  need  be. 

"  A  cannon  squad  has  been  organized  under  the 
command  of  W.  W.  Frybarger,  tendered  to  the  Gov- 
ernor of  the  State,  and  accepted.  They  comprise  a 
small  band  of  brave  hearts  and  stout  arms,  and  they 
will  preserve  the  honor  of  Fayette  County  untarnished 
in  the  trying  hour. 

"A  company  of  volunteers  of  over  a  hundred  men 
has  been  organized,  tendered  to  the  Governor,  and 
accepted.  The  company  is  styled  the  '  Fayette  Coun- 
ty Guards,'  and  is  officered  as  follows: 

"Captain,  Joseph  Marshall;  First  Lieutenant, 
Joseph  Greer;  Second  Lieutenant,  Thomas  J. 
Powell;    Third    Lieutenant,    Jesse    Holton;      First 


Ensign,  John  Kensler;  Orderly  Sergeant,  John  Mc- 
Cleary. 

II  *  *  *  ^  Zouave  company  is  being  formed. 
A  large  number  of  citizens  of  Fayette  County  assem-

COUNTY  EXPENPITDRES. 

James  EUivtt  was  appointed  agent  for  the  county 
in  the  distribution  of  funds  and  continued  to  act  as 
such  during  the  entire  war.  Tbe  county  expended 
during  that  period  for  the  relief  of  soldiers'  families 
164,366.37,  and  for  miscellaneous  purposes  19,201.4:5, 
which  with  the  amount  expended  for  local  bounty 
amounted  to  $264,331.82. 

DEPARTURE  OF  THE  FAYETTE  COUNTY  UNION  GUARDS. 

The  "Fayette  County  Union  Guards"  left  for 
camp  at  Eichmond  Friday,  May  10,  1861.  About  10 
o'clock  the  company  was  drawn  up  in  line  in  the 
court  house  yard,  when  a  few  remarks  were  made  by 
Capt.  Marshall  and  a  pathetic  farewell  address  was 
delivered  by  Rev.  William  Pelan;  and  a  committee  of 
ladies  presented  each  volunteer  with  a  Testament, 
when  by  means  of  vehicles  the  company  left  for 
camp.  The  very  air  itself  was  laden  with  patriotism; 
the  National  flag  floated  from  housetops  and  the 
whole  country  was  filled  with  noise  and  excitement  of 
military  preparation. 

No  one  party  filled  the  ranks;  the  volunteers  of 
Fayette  came  from  all  parties;  Repiiblicans,  Demo- 
crats, and  Bell-Evprett  men,  all  forgot  their  differ- 
ences and  gave  their  services  to  support  the  Constitu- 
tion and  the  Union. 

DRAFTS,   BOUNTIES,  ETC. 

The  war  called  for  so  large  a  proportion  of  the 
entire  male  population  that  the  quota  of  the  county 
was  not  in  all  cases  filled  without  difficulty.  Drafts 
and  the  offer  of  large  bounties  to  volunteers  were 
found  necessary,  hence  many  of  the  recruits  on  being 
mustered  into  service  received  considerable  bounty. 

The  draft  assignment  of  October  6,  1862,  to  Fay- 
ette County  was  as  follows:  Connersviile  Township, 
6;  Orange,  1;  Harrison,  5;  Posey,  27;  Waterloo,  18; 
Fairview,  13. 

The  men  who  filled  the  quota  of  Fayette  County 
were  with  the  exception  of  an  inconsiderable  fraction 
volunteers.  The  county,  with  a  total  militia  enroll- 
ment in  September,  1862,  of  1,081,  had  sent  to  the 
field  560  men,  requiring  the  following  month  the 
small  draft  only  of  70  men.

HISTORY  OF  ORGANIZATION  AND  REaiMENTS. 

The  regiments  from  Indiana  which  contained  the 
'  greatest  number  of  men  from  Fayette  County,  were 
the  Sixteenth,  Thirty-sixth,  Sixty-ninth,  One  Hun- 
dred and  Twenty-Fourth,  Forty-first,  Third  Battery, 
and  Third  Cavalry,  the  following  history  of  which 
is  condensed  from  the  elaborate  report  of  the  late 
Hon.  W.  H.  H.  Terrell  Adjutant-General  of  Indiana: 

Sixteenth  Regiment  Indiana  Volunteer  Infantry. 
— Of  the  several  companies  raised  in  Fayette  County, 
Company  E  formed  a  part  of  the  Sixteenth  Indiana 
Volunteer  Infantry  (one  year's  service).  Its  Captain 
was  John  M.  Orr,  and  First  Lieutenant,  William  H. 
Greer,  both  of  Connersville. 

The  organization  of  the  regiment  was  completed 
at  Richmond  in  May,  1861,  with  Pleasant  A.  Hackle- 
man  as  Colonel.  It  was  intended  to  serve  within 
the  limits  of  the  State  for  one  year,  but  its  services 
were  offered  and  accepted  by  the  General  Government 
the  same  day  that  the  North  was  startled  with  the 
news  of  the  disaster  at  Bull  Run.  July  23  the 
regiment  left  Richmond  and  was  the  first  regiment 
that  marched  through  Baltimore  after  the  firing 
upon  the  Sixth  Massachusetts  Regiment,  in  April- 
Reaching  Harper's  Ferry  it  was  assigned  to  Gen_ 
Banks'  army.  October  21 — the  fatal  day  of  Ball's 
Bluff— the  regiment  marched  all  day  long  under  the 
sound  of  cannon.  In  the  afternoon  of  the  2  2d  an 
attack  was  made  upon  the  pickets,  in  which  two  men 
of  the  Sixteenth  were  killed.  Immediately  after  the 
regiment  was  huiTied  forward,  in  line  of  battle,  on 
the  Bluffs,  and  here  in  the  evening  participated  in 
a  brisk  engagement  with  the  enemy.  Orders  being 
given  for  an  evacuation  the  Sixteenth  was  detailed 
on  the  23d  as  a  picket  line,  to  cover  the  retreat  of 
our  forces,  and  was  the  last  regiment  to  recross  the 
Potomac,  reaching  the  Maryland  shore  at  daylight 
on  the  24th.  Two  men  were  drowned  during  this 
expedition.  It  went  into  winter  quarters  ("Canton- 
ment Hicks")  near  Frederick  City,  December  6. 

In  February,  1862,  the  long  expected  movement 
of  the  armies  commenced.  In  March  the  Sixteenth, 
with  a  detachment  of  other  troops  from  the  brigade, 
built  a  bridge  across  the  Shenandoah  at  Snicker's 
Ferry,  accomplishing  the  work  in  forty-eight  hours. 
Here  six  men  of  Stonewall  Jackson's  army  were  cap- 
tured by  Lieut.  Copeland,  of  the  Sixteenth.  May 
12  it  left  for  Washington,  D.  C,  where  on  the  14th 
of  May  it  was  mustered  out  of  service  and  soon  after 
returned  to  Indiana.  Its  commanding  Colonel  was 
on  April  30  commissioned  a  Brigadier-General  and 
on  May  13,  in  presence  of  the  regiment,  an  elegant 


sword  was  presented  by  the  enlisted  men  of  the  Six- 
teenth. This  gallant  officer  was  killed  in  battle  at 
luka.  Miss.  Lieut. -Col.  Thomas  J.  Lucas  succeeded 
him  as  Colonel. 

Company  A  formed  part  of  the  Sixteenth  Regi- 
ment Indiana  Volunteer  Infantry  (three  years'  serv- 
ice). Its  successive  commissioned  officers  from  this 
county  were:  Captains,  JohnM.  Orr,  John  A.  Haines, 
Timothy  Doherty;  First  Lieutenants,  John  A.  Haines, 
Timothy  Doherty,  JohnKensler;  Second  Lieutenants, 
Timothy  Doherty,  John  Kensler,  .Thomas  M.  Hardy 
and  Lawrence  Rowan. 

The  regiment  was  re-organized  for  three  years' 
service  at  Indianapolis,  May  27,  1862,  with  Thomas 
J.  Lucas  as  Colonel.  The  regiment  left  August  19  for 
Kentucky  to  aid  in  repelling  the  invasion  of  the 
State  by  Kirby  Smith.  On  the  30th  of  August  it 
took  part  in  the  battle  of  Richmond,  Ky. ,  losing  200 
men  killed  and  wounded,  and  600  prisoners.  Lieut. 
Col.  Joel  Wolfe  was  killed  in  this  action  while  the 
regiment  was  endeavoring  to  cut  its  way  through  the 
Rebel  lines.  After  the  defeat  the  prisoners  were 
paroled  and  sent  to  Indianapolis,  where  they  remained 
in  parole  camp  until  November  1,  when  exchanged. 
On  the  20th  of  that  month  the  regiment  marched  to 
Cairo,  and  from  thence  to  Memphis,  where  it  remained 
until  December  1,  and  then  moved  down  the  river  to 
participate  in  the  Vicksburg  campaign.  On  the 
25th  the  brigade  of  which  the  Sixteenth  was  a  part 
was  sent  to  cut  the  Texas  &amp;  Shreveport  Railroad  at 
Dallas.  In  this  expedition  it  marched  sixty-five  miles 
in  thirty-six  hours,  swam  two  bayous,  destroyed  ten 
miles  of  railroad  track  and  burned  $1,000,000 
worth  of  property  belonging  to  the  Rebel  Government. 
On  the  1st  of  January,  1863,  it  engaged  the  enemy 
in  the  attempt  to  storm  his  works  at  Chickasaw 
Bayou,  near  Vicksburg,  and  was  driven  back,  the 
brigade  to  which  it  was  attached  losing  500  men. 
Re-embarking  on  the  3d,  the  Sixteenth  reached  Ar- 
kansas Post  on  the  10th  of  January,  and  attacked  the 
enemy  in  the  fort,  skirmishing  until  night  fall.  On 
the  11th  it  participated  in  the  general  engagement  that 
ensued,  and  was  the  first  regiment  to  plant  its  colors 
within  the  fort;  its  loss  was  seventy-seven  men  killed 
and  wounded.  The  surrender  was  made  by  the  same 
officer  (Gen.  Churchill)  to  whom  the  Sixteenth  sur- 
rendered at  Richmond,  and  among  the  captured 
wagons  were  some  that  the  regiment  had  lost  in  its 
retreat  at  that  time.  The  Sixteenth  was  at  Hard 
Times  Landing,  opposite  and  above  Grand  Gulf,  dur- 
ing the  unsuccessful  attempt  of  the  gun-boats  to 
reduce  Grand  Gulf.  It  was  at  Port  Gibson  and 
formed  part  of  the  reserve  to  Gen.  Hovey's  division, 
and  marching  forward  engaged  the  enemy,  driving 
him  from   the  hill   in  front.      It    participated    in    a

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


severe  skirinish  with  the  enemy  near  Edward's  Station 
May  16,  after  which  the  regiment  marched  to  Black 
River  Bridge,  where  it  fought  at  that  point.  It  then 
proceeded  to  the  rear  of  Vicksburg,  and  went  into 
the  trenches  on  the  IQtli  of  May,  and  participated  in 
all  of  the  operations  of  the  siege  until  the  capitula- 
tion on  the  4th  of  July.  In  the  assault  on  the 
enemy's  works  on  the  2'2d  of  May,  the  Sixteenth 
bore  a  conspicuous  part,  holding  an  important  posi- 
tion for  nearly  ten  hours'  continuous  fighting,  and 
part  of  the  time  was  within  twenty-live  feet  of  the 
Rebel  fort  in  its  front.  During  the  siege  the  regiment 
lost  sixty  men  killed  and  wounded.  After  the  sur- 
render the  regiment  marched  to  Jackson,  where  it 
took  part  in  the  skirmishing  on  the  march  and  at 
that  place.  It  was  transported  to  New  Orleans,  where 
it  was  mounted  and  attached  to  the  Cavalry  Corps, 
Department  of  the  Gulf,  and  was  distributed  along 
the  eastern  shore  of  the  Mississippi,  to  pi-otect  trans- 
portation between  New  Orleans  and  points  up  the 
coast.  In  October  the  Cavalry  Corps  was  ordered  on 
an  expedition  up  the  Bayou  Teche,  in  which  section 
the  Sixteenth  remained  continually  skirmishing  with 
the  enemy  until  January  2,  1864.  It  was  refitted 
and  re-mounted  and  marched  as  part  of  the  cavalry 
of  Banks'  expedition  up  Red  River,  during  which 
campaign  it  had  sixteen  engagements  with  the  enemy. 
The  regiment  was  reviewed  in  New  Orleans,  where 
it  had  been  ordered  for  muster  out,  by  Gen.  Grierson, 
who  complimented  it  on  having  turned  over  to  the 
Quartermaster  the  best  horses  that  had  ever  been  in 
that  department,  and  as  a  compliment  to  the  men 
whose  terms  of  service  had  not  then  expired,  it  was 
ordered  by  Gen.  Canby  that  they  be  transferred  to 
the  Thirteenth  Indiana  Cavalry,  thus  putting  together 
infantry  and  cavalry,  an  unknown  precedent  during 
the  war.  The  regiment  was  mustered  out  at  New 
Orleans  June  30,  1865.  It  arrived  at  Indianapolis 
July  10,  1865,  with  365  men  and  officers,  and  on  the 
next  day  it  had  a  public  reception  in  the  capitol 
grounds,  at  which  the  regiment  was  addressed  by 
Gov.  Morton  and  others. 

Thirty-sixth  Regiment,  Indiana  Volunteer  In- 
fantry.— Company  H  formed  a  part  of  the  Thirty- 
sixth  Indiana  Volunteer  Infantry.  Its  successive 
commissioned  officers  were  Captains,  Gilbert  Trusler, 
William  F.  Limpus;  First  Lieutenants,  Addison  M. 
Davis,  John  L.  Hensley,  William  F.  Limpus,  George 
Mullikin;  Second  Lieutenants,  William  F.  Limpus, 
George  Mullikin,  James  Patterson,  and  Joseph  Hilli- 
goss.  Gilbert  Trusler,  of  Connersville,  was  commis- 
sioned Major  of  the  regiment,  June  3,  1863,  and 
resigned  the  following  December,  and  Daniel  D. 
Hall,  of  the  same  place,  served  as  Surgeon  of  the 
regiment  from  September,  1861,  to  March,  1882. 


The  Thirty-sixth  Regiment  was  organized  "at 
Richmond,  and  mustered  into  service  for  three  years, 
on  the  16th  of  September,  1861,  and  soon  after  left 
for  the  field.  During  the  fall  and  winter  of  1861  it 
encamped  and  marched  with  the  Army  of  the  Ohio, 
until  it  reached  Nashville,  in  February,  1862.  In 
March  it  moved  to  the  Tennessee  River,  and  reached 
the  field  of  Shiloh  in  time  to  take  an  active  part  in 
that  great  battle,  in  which  it  sustained  a  loss  of  nine 
killed,  thirty-eight  wounded  and  one  missing.  It 
was  at  the  siege  of  Corinth,  and  participated  therein 
until  the  evacuation.  It  pursued  Bragg  through 
Kentucky  with  Buell's  army,  and  participated .  with 
Rosecrans'  army  in  the  battle  at  Stone  River,  and  it 
was  atChickamauga,  and  in  both  sustained  losses  in 
killed,  wounded  and  missing.  It  subsequently  moved 
with  Sherman's  army  toward  Atlanta,  and  partici- 
pated in  the  marches,  skirmishes  and  engagements  of 
that  eventful  campaign. 

Sixty-ninth  Regiment,  Indiana  Volunteer  In- 
fantry.— Company  K  formed  a  part  of  the  Sixty- 
ninth  Regiment,  Indiana  Volunteer  Infantry.  Its 
successive  commissioned  officers  were:  Captains,  Will- 
iam Kerr,  Jesse  Holton;  First  Lieutenants,  Jesse 
Holton,  William  G.  Plummer,  Joseph  Senior,  Harvey 
A.  Zimmerman;  Second  Lieutenants,  William  G. 
I'lummer,  Joseph  Senior.  Job  Stout,  of  Conners- 
ville, was  commissioned  Lieutenant-Colonel  of  the 
regiment,  August  19,  1862,  and  resigned  January  21, 
1863.  William  M.  Smith  and  William  Stewart,  of 
Connersville,  served  respectively  as  Quartermaster. 

The  Sixty-ninth  Regiment  was  organized  at  Rich- 
mond on  the  19th  of  August,  1862,  with  William  A. 
Bickle  as  Colonel.  On  the  20th  of  August  it  left 
for  Kentucky,  and  on  reaching  Lexington  moved  in  the 
direction  of  Richmond,  Ky.  Near  this  place,  on  the 
30th  of  August,  it  participated  in  the  battle  with 
Kirby  Smith's  Rebel  forces,  losing  218  men  and  offi- 
cers, killed  and  wounded.  Though  the  men  fought 
bravely,  the  disciplined  troops  of  the  enemy  over- 
powered the  regiment  and  captured  it  almost  en  masse. 
The  captured  men  were  immediately  paroled  and  sent 
to  parole  camp,  Indianapolis.  Upon  being  exchanged 
the  regiment  was  re-organized  at  Indianapolis  and 
left  that  place  on  the  27th  of  November,  1862,  for 
Memphis,  Tenn,,  in  command  of  Col.  Thomas  W. 
Bennett.  On  the  20th  of  December  it  proceeded 
down  the  Mississippi  River  with  Sheldon's  brigade 
of  Morgan's  division  of  Sherman's  wing  of  Grant's 
army,  on  the  expedition  to  Vicksburg.  In  the  assault 
upon  the  enemy's  works  at  Chickasaw  Bluffs,  the 
Sixty-ninth  took  part,  suffering  but  a  slight  loss. 
After  the  repulse  at  this  place,  the  regiment  moved

it  proceeded  to  Young's  Point,  and  while  stationed 
there  over  100  men  died  from  disease.  In  the  latter 
part  of  February  it  moved  to  Milliken's  Bend,  and 
on  the  morning  of  the  30th  of  March  marched  as  the 
advance  regiment  of  Grant's  army  in  the  movement 
against  Vicksburg.  On  reaching  Roundaway  Bayou, 
opposite  Richmond,  La.,  in  the  afternoon,  a  Rebel 
force  was  found  and  dislodged.  It  was  during  this 
movement  that  2,000  feet  of  bridging  was  constructed 
in  three  days.  Thus  was  a  military  road  completed 
across  the  peninsula  from  the  river  above  Vicksburg, 
to  the  river  forty  miles  below  that  city,  over  which 
the  whole  army  rapidly  moved.  On  the  30th  of 
April  the  advance  crossed  the  Mississippi  at  Hard 
Times  Landing,  and  disembarked  at  D'Schron's,  on 
the  opposite  bank,  from  whence  it  marched  to  Port 
Gibson,  where  on  the  Ist  of  May  the  battle  of  Thomp- 
Bon's  Hill  was  fought.  In  this  engagement  the 
Sixty-ninth  lost  seventy-one  killed  and  wounded. 
On  the  16th  of  May  it  was  engaged  at  Champion 
Hills,  and  on  the  17th  of  May  took  part  in  the 
assault  on  the  enemy's  works  at  Black  River  Bridge. 
It  then  moved  to  the  rear  of  the  Rebel  works  at  Vicks- 
burg, participating  in  the  siege  up  to  and  including 
the  assault  on  the  22d  of  May.  On  the  23d  of  May 
it  moved  with  Osterhaus'  division  to  the  Black  River 
Bridge,  where  it  was  stationed  during  the  remainder 
of  the  siege  of  Vicksburg,  holding  Johnson  in 
check.  During  all  these  operations  on  the  east 
side  of  the  Mississippi  River,  the  regiment  served 
in  Osterhaus'  division,  which  opened  every  engage- 
ment prior  to  the  investment  of  Vicksburg. 

At  Jackson  the  Sixty-ninth  was  actively  engaged 
during  the  six  days'  siege  of  that  place.  *  *  * 
On  the  13th  of  February,  186-1,  it  sailed  for  Indian- 
ola,  and  on  the  13th  of  March  evacuated  that  place 
and  started  for  Matagorda  Island.  During  the  prog- 
ress of  this  movement,  while  crossing  from  Birnio's 
Island  to  Matagorda  Island,  a  boat  swamped  and  two 
officers  and   twenty  men  were   drowned.         *         * 

*  *  It  met  Bauks'  retreating  army  at  Alex- 
andria, on  the  27th  of  April,  and  was  engaged  in  the 
fight  near  that  place,  and,  in  the  retreat  from  that 
place  to  the  Mississippi  River,  supported  Lucas' 
cavalry  brigade,  which  covered  the  retreat.  *  * 
•»  *  On  the  20th  of  March  it  moved  with  Steel's 
expedition  through  Florida  and  southern  Alabama, 
arriving  in  the  rear  of  Blakely  on  the  1st  of  April. 
In  the  assault  on  Blakely,  on  the  9th  of  April,  the 
regiment  was  engaged,  after  which  it  guarded  Rebel 
prisoners  from  Blakely   to   Ship  Island.  *         * 

*  *  On  the  5th  day  of  July,  1865,  the  battalion 
was  mustered  out  of  service  (the  regiment  was  con- 
solidated into  a  battalion)  at  Mobile,  and  on  the  7th 
left  for  home,  having  sixteen  officers  and  284  men. 


This  regiment  has  left  its  dead  in  eleven  States, 
and  participated  in  the  battles  of  Richmond,  Ky., 
Chickasaw  Bluflfs,  Arkansas  Post,  Thompson's  Hill, 
Champion  Hill,  Black  River  Bridge,  the  sieges  of 
Vicksburg  and  Jackson,  and  the  capture  of  Blakely, 
Ala.,  which  caused  the  surrender  of  Mobile. 

Second  Cavalry  (Forty-first  Regiment,  Indiana 
Volunteers). — Company  L  formed  a  part  of  the  Sec-

Charles  Mount  for  a  year  as  Commissary. 

Capt.  Walker  was  commissioned  as  Major  of  the 
regiment  June  21,  1862,  and  resigned  May  29,  1863. 

This  was  the  first  complete  cavalry  regiment 
raised  in  Indiana.  It  was  organized  in  Indianapolis 
in  September,  1861,  with  John  A.  Bridgeland  as  Col- 
onel. In  February,  1862,  it  marched  with  Buell's 
army  toward  Nashville,  and  from  that  point  moved  to 
the  Tennessee  River,  reaching  the  field  of  Shiloh  after 
the  battle.  On  the  19th  of  April  it  had  a  skirmish 
with  the  enemy  on  the  road  to  Corinth,  and  on  the 
15th  it  engaged  the  Rebels  at  Pea  Ridge,  Tenn.,  los- 
ing a  number  in  killed  and  wounded.  On  the  22d 
it  participated  in  a  reconnoisance  in  force,  driving 
the  enemy  three  miles.  During  the  siege  of  Corinth 
it  was  actively  engaged,  and  immediately  after  the 
evacuation  marched  with  Buell's  army  into  northern 
Alabama  and  on  the  31st  of  May  had  a  skirmish  with 
the  enemy  at  Tuscumbia,  losing  a  few  men  in  killed 
and  wounded. 

Moving  into  Tennessee  the  regiment  fought  the 
enemy  at  McMinnville  on  the  9th  of  August  and  at 
Gallatin  on  the  21st  and  27th  of  August,  losing  sev- 
eral in  killed,  wounded  and  missing.  In  September 
it  marched  into  Kentucky,  participating  in  the  Bragg 
and  Buell  campaign,  engaging  the  enemy  at  Vinegar 
Hill  on  the  22d  of  September,  and  at  Perryville  on 
the  8th  of  October.  On  the  30th  of  November,  while 
the  regiment  was  at  Nashville,  a  detachment  under 
command  of  Maj.  Samuel  Hill  was  highly  compli- 
mented by  Gen.  Rosecrans,  in  special  field  orders, 
for  having  recaptured  a  government  train,  defeating 
Rebel  cavalry,  killing  twenty  and  capturing  200  prie- 
onors.  On  the  11th  of  June,  1863,  it  fought  the  en- 
emy at  Triune,  Tenn.,  losing  a  number  in  killed  and 
wounded.  It  participated  in  a  sharp  fight  at  Talbott's 
Station.  While  at  Mossy  Creek,  Tenn.,  the  regiment 
re-enlisted  January  10,  1864,  and  during  the  winter

as  Lieutenant-Colonel  of  the  regiment  March  8.  1S64, 
and  promoted  Colonel  Jnly  10  of  the  same  year. 

George  F.  Stewai-t.  of  Couuersville,  served  )»s  Sec-

E,  and  John  B.  Schissler  as  First  Lieutenant  in  Com- 
piiny  F.  of  the  regiment;  and  a  number  of  privates  in 
C!omjiany  G    wei^e  fixim  this  county. 

The  regiment  was  mustered  into  sei'vice  Miu-eh  10, 
iStU.  with  James  Burgess  as  Colonel.  It  went  to 
Nashville,  xvaching  that  fx&gt;int  on  the  24th  of  the 
same  month,  and  was  assigned  to  the  division  of 
Gen.  Hovey.  .\pril  5  the  regiment  left  Nashville 
for  the  front,  marching  by  way  of  MurfrtvsKiro. 
Shelbyville,  TuUahoma,  Stevenson.  Bridgejx&gt;rt,  Chat- 
tanooga, and  so  on.  The  Twenty -third  Corps,  to 
which  the  ivgiment  was  assigned,  arrived  in  front  of 
Buzzard's  Boost  May  S.  A  demonstration  was 
made  by  Gen.  Scotieldnpon  that  formidable  position, 
the  regiment  losing  one  killed  and  two  wounded.  A 
portion  of  Sherman's  army  having  penetrated  Snake 
Creek  Gap,  the  regiment  move^i  with  its  division 
through  the  Gap,  and  crossed  the  Ostanaula  Eiver, 
near  Tilton,  Our  column  then  passed  to  the  left  of 
Resaca,  and  marched  on  the  ISth  to  Calhoun.  It 
moved  tlie  next  day  to  the  right  of  Kingston,  and 
skirmished    along     the  railroad.     On    the     21st    it 


enconntorod  the  enemy,  and  brisk  skirmishing  ensued. 
On  the  tirsf  of  iluue  the  regiment  was  engaged  in 
sharp  skirmishing  in  the  vicinity  of  AUatoona  and 
Pumpkin  Vine  Creek,  and  took  jvsition  opposite  to 
and  neiu'  Lost  Mountain.  Temporiuy  works  were 
constructed,  and  for  two  daj*s  sharp  fighting  was 
had  with  the  enemy.  The  skirmish  line  then  moved 
close  to  tlie  formidable  works  of  the  enemy,  the  regi- 
ment advancing  in  snpjwrt  under  a  heavy  lire  of 
artillery  and  musketry.  The  enemy  having  evacuated 
the  works,  the  regiment  took  position  on  the  right  of 
Kenesaw  Mountain.  On  the  23d  tlie  regiment 
advanced  close  up  to  the  enemy's  works  on  Kenesaw 
Mountain,  and  skirmished  with  his  sharp-shoot&lt;»rs. 
The  picket  firing  and  skirmishing  continued  until 
the  morning  of  July  3,  when  the  Rebel  Gen. 
Johnston  suddenly  abandoned  his  strong  position, 
and  fell  back  to  Smyrna  Church.  The  regiment 
encountered  the  enemy  near  Decatur,  where  brisk 
skirmishing  ensueil,  resulting  in  tlie  enemy  being 
ilriven  through  Decatur,  and  the  capture  of  that 
town.  For  several  days  it  was  engaged  in  skirmish- 
ing, and  on  the  2 1st  of  July  reached  a  position 
where  the  hills  and  stoeples  of  Atlanta  could  be  seen. 
On  the  22d  the  regiment  moved  with  its  division, 
and  aide^l  materially  in  repulsing  the  Rebels  under 
Hood  and  Haivlee.  who  had  attacked  oiu-  forces. 
The  siege  of  .Atlanta  progressed  vigorously  until 
August  30,  when  its  evacuation  was  forced,  during  all 
of  which  time  the  regiment  played  its  part. 

October  4.  the  regiment  marched  with  its  corps 
in  pursuit  of  Hood,  the  column  moving  by  the  way 
of  Marietta  to  AUatoona,  and  thence  through  Cass- 
ville  and  Kingston,  to  Rome:  and  crossing  the  Ostan- 
aula River  at  that  place  on  the  12th,  a  sharp  skir- 
mish was  had  with  a  portion  of  the  enemy's  forces, 
his  main  Ixxly  having  marched  with  great  rapidity 
towards  Kesaca  and  Dalton.  The  column  tiien 
headeil  for  Calhoun  and  Resaca,  but  the  Rebel  Army 
had  disappeared  before  our  .arrival.  The  pui-suit  was 
continued  through  Snake  Creek  and  Mhite's  Gaps  to 
Summerville.  and  down  the  Chattanooga  Valley  to 
Gaylesville.  Ala.,  where  the  pursuit  was  discon- 
tinued. The  Twenty-third  soon  became  a  part  of 
the  command  of  Gen.  Thomas.  The  regiment,  Octo- 
ber 23,  moved  with  its  division  to  Cedivr  Bluffs, 
and  marched  to  Dalton  cia  Cave  Spring.  Rome, 
Resaca  and  Tilton.  It  was  then  transported  to

C,  ■which  was  captured  by  the  enemy.  The  regi- 
ment reached  Franklin  on  the  morning  of  November 
30,  and  immediately  took  position  in  line  of  battle 
OQ  the  southern  edge  of  that  town.  Slight  breast- 
works were  hastily  constructed;  the  enemy  soon 
appeared  in  force,  and  made  several  attempts  to  carry 
the  position  by  assault.  These  successive  attacks  were 
met  and  most  decisively  repulsed.  During  the  night 
the  regiment  fell  back  with  the  army  to  Nashville, 
and  took  position  to  the  right  of  Fort  Negley,  whore 
it  was  employed  in  erecting  defenses  until  December 
15.  On  the  latter  date  the  army  of  Gen.  Thomas 
advanced  from  its  fortifications  around  Nashville, 
upon  the  Rebel  Army  of  Gen.  Hood,  and  after  two 
days  severe  fighting,  inflicted  a  ruinous  defeat  upon 
the  Rebel  foe.  Thei'egiment  took  part  in  this  battle, 
and  joined  in  the  pursuit  of  Hood's  demoralized 
army. 

In  1865  the  regiment  proceeded  to  North  Carolina, 
landing  at  Morehead  City  February  27.  March  6  it 
marched  with  Gen.  Scofield's  column  along  the  rail- 
road toward  Kingston.  Upon  reaching  Wise's  Forks, 
the  enemy  was  encountered  in  a  strong  position  in 
force.  Heavy  skirmishing  was  kept  up  during  the 
first  day.  On  the  9th  the  enemy  being  largely 
re-enforced,  made  an  assault  upon  our  left  and  center, 
and,  after  a  severe  battle,  was  repulsed  and  retreated 
in  much  confusion.  The  regiment  took  an  active 
part  in  this  battle.  On  the  15th  it  crossed  the  Neuse 
River  and  marched  to  Kingston ;  thence  to  Goldsboro, 
reaching  there  on  the  21st,  where  the  junction  was 
formed  with  the  victorious  columns  of  Sherman,  who 
had  marched  from  Atlanta  to  the  sea,  and  from  the 
sea  through  the  strongholds  of  the  Rebel  hiding-places, 
halting  in  the  "  Old  North  State"  only  long  enough 
to  greet  their  old  comrades  of  the  Twenty-third 
Corps  and  press  forward  to  final  victory.  The  regi- 
ment was  mustered  out  at  Greensboro  August  31, 
1865. 

The  Third  Battery.— The  Third  Battery,  Light 
Artillery,  Indiana  Volunteers,  was  organized  at  Con- 
nersville  on  the  5th  of  August,  and  mustered  into 
service  August  24,  1861,  with  W.  W.  Frybarger  as 
Captain  During  the  month  of  September  the  battery 
moved  to  St.  Louis,  was  assigned  to  Gen.  Fremont's 
army  and  moved  with  that  army  in  the  campaign 
through  southwest  Missouri.  Upon  the  close  of  his 
campaign  Capt.  Frybarger  being  promoted  Major 
(November  80),  and  ordered  to  Indianapolis  for  the 
purpose  of  organizing  batteries,  Lieut.  James  M. 
Cockefair  was  promoted  Captain.  From  Springfield 
the  battery  moved  to  Tipton  and  thence  to  LaMine 
Cantonment,  where  it  remained  until  the  spring  of 
1862.  During  the  summer  and  fall  of  1862  sections 
of  the  Third  Battery  were  dispatched  to  different  por- 


tions of  Missouri,  and  engaged  in  numerous  en- 
counters with  straggling  forces  of  the  enemy.  This 
duty  was  exceedingly  arduous  and  difficult,  owing  to 
the  long  and  frequent  marches,  and  the  impossibility 
of  forcing  the  enemy  to  a  decisive  battle.  Sharp 
encounters  were  had  with  the  enemy  at  Mooe's  Mill, 
Kirksville  and  Lone  Jack,  in  which  the  battery  lost 
in  killed  and  wounded.  After  a  separation  of  nine 
months,  and  having  traversed  the  principal  portion 
of  Missouri,  the  Third  Battery  rendezvoused  at 
Springfield  during  the  winter  of  1862.  It  was 
stationed  at  St.  Louis  until  the  latter  part  of  1863. 
In  November,  1863,  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the 
battery  re-enlisted  as  veterans.  It  moved  with  the 
column  under  command  of  Gen.  A.  J.  Smith  in  the 
winter  of  1863-64  through  western  Tennessee.  The 
battery  then  moved  to  Memj)his,  and  with  its  division 
proceeded  on  steamer  to  Vicksbiu'g,  with  the  column 
of  Gen.  Sherman,  and  proceeded  to  Meridian,  Miss. 
Having  aided  in  sufficiently  destroying  the  enemy's 
communications,  the  battery  retui'ned  with  the  army 
to  its  place  of  starting. 

On  the  8th  of  March  the^Third  Battery  proceeded 
up  the  Red  River  by  steamboat,  and  took  part  in  the 
storming  and  captiu-e  of  Fort  De  Russy.  Thence  the 
battery  moved  with  Gen.  A.  J.  Smith's  command, 
and  on  the  9th  of  April  was  engaged  in  the  battle  of 
Pleasant  Hill,  in  which  the  pursuing  enemy  were 
checked  and  routed.  The  battery  was  engaged 
almost  constantly  in  covering  the  retreat  of  Banks' 
army,  until  it  reached  Morganza  Bend,  on  the  Mis- 
sissippi River,  May  21.  During  this  campaign  it 
took  part  in  the  battles  at  Cautcherville,  Cane  Run, 
Alexandria,  Old  Oaks  and  Round  Lake.  Upon 
reaching  the  Mississippi  River  the  battery  embarked 
with  its  corps  and  moved  toVicksburg;  thence  to 
Memphis,  and  thence  marched  to  Tupelo,  Miss.,  being 
engaged  with  the  enemy  at  Tupelo,  Tallahatchie, 
Jackson  and  Clinton,  Miss.,  during  this  movement 
across  the  country. 

It  moved  with  the  Sixteenth  Army  Corps  to  St. 
Louie,  and  joined  the  forces  of  Gen.  Rosecrans,  in 
the  pursuit  of  the  Rebel  Gen.  Price,  in  the  fall  of 
1864.  After  marching  800  miles  in  twenty-four  days, 
without  being  able  to  overtake  the  enemy,  the  Third 
Battery  returned  to  St.  Louis,  and  moved  from  thence 
to  Nashville,  Tenn.  Here,  with  tlie  army  of  Gen. 
Thomas,  the  battery  took  part  in  the  decisive  engage- 
ment in  front  of  Nashville,  on  the  15th  and  16th  of 
December,  1864,  which  resulted  in  the  defeat  and  rout 
of  Hood' s  Rebel  army.  The  battery  was  subsequently 
assigned  to  Gen.  Canby's  command,  and  operated  with 
his  army  upon  the  defenses  of  Mobile.  It  was 
actively  engaged  in  the  siege  and  capture  of  Fort 
Blakely,  which  completed  the   surrender  of  Mobile.

to  Lawrencoburg  and  thence  marched  toward  Harri- 
son, Ohio.  After  Morgan's  escape  into  Ohio,  the 
regiment  returned  to  Greensburg,  and  was  mustered 
out  July  18,  1863. 

One  Hundred  and  Ninth  Regiment  WO-Days 
Fo/«Mfee;s.— Company  F  of  the  One  Hundred  and 
Thirty-ninth  Regiment  100-Days  Volunteers  was 
from  Fayette  County.  The  regiment  was  organized 
and  mustered  into  service  at  Indianapolis  on  the  8th 
of  June,  1864,  with  George  Humphrey  as  Colonel, 
and  soon  after  proceeded  to  Tennessee.  This,  with 
the  other  regiiuents  of  100-days  men,  on  arriving  at 
Nashville  was  assigned  to  duty  at  different  places 
along  the  lines  of  the  Nashville  &amp;  Chattanooga, 
Tennessee  &amp;,  Alabama,  and  Memphis  &amp;  Charleston 
Railroads,  and  until  the  latter  part  of  August,  1864, 
were  kept  constantly  engaged  in  guarding  those  lines 
of  comiaunication,  used  by  Gon.  Sherman  for  the 
transportation  of  supplies  to  his  army  then  advanc- 
ing on  Atlanta.  The  regiment  served  beyond  the 
period  of  100  days,  and  returned  to  Indianapolis, 
where  it  was  finally  discharged  from  the  service. 

Fayette  County  sustained  an  honorable  part,  and 
claims  the  full  share  of  the  glory  on  the  records  of 
the  regiments  in  which  its  men  fought  in  the  war  of 
Rebellion. 


LADIES      AID    SOCIETIES,    DONATIONS,    ETC. 

Throughout  the  war,  the  mothers,  wives  and  sis- 
ters at  home  were  ever  earnest  in  their  ministrations 
to  the  soldiers,  supplying  those  delicacies  and  com- 
forts needed  in  the  field.  The  soldiers'  families,  too, 
were  cared  for,  as  may  be  judged  from  the  great 
relief  fund  expended. 

The  Ladies'  Aid  Society  of  Connersville  was 
organized  at  the  court  house  January  13,  1862,  and 
the  following  named  officers  were  elected:  Mrs.  James 
C.  Mcintosh,  President;  Miss  Callie  Youse,  Vice-Pres- 
ident; Mrs.  A.  B.  Gates,  Treasurer;  Miss  Fannie 
Newkirk,  Secretary. 

At  various  periods  during  the  war  the  farmers 
throughout  the  county  donated  liberally  in  the  way  of 
wood.  By  reference  to  the  files  of  the  press  it  is 
noticed  that  up  to  October  22,  1863,  250  cords  had 
been  donated.  June  20  seventeen  loads  were  brought 
to  town  by  the  citizens  of  Waterloo  Township,  the 
contributors  being  Capt.  J.  S.  Hamilton,  Joseph  Cole, 
Amos  G.  Smith,  William  Henry,  Harrison  McPhai-in, 
W.  J.  Orr,  William  Green,  Matthew  Job,  John  Roys- 
don,  T.  L.  Hamilton,  J.  Burris,  S.  Duseuberry,  S. 
L.  Hurst,  James  Morris  and  Daniel  Burris.  Those 
in  the  Lockhart  neighborhood  subscribed  40  loads; 
those  in  the  Shrader  neighborhood  brought  in  17 
loads;  Harrison  Township,  51;  Connersville  Town- 
ship, 52.  In  December,  1864,  upward  of  100  loads 
were  donated  by  the  farmers  in  general. 

CLOSING  SCENES. 

The  following  oxti'act  from  the  Times  of  April  13, 
1865,  will  give  the  reader  an  idea  of  the  manner  in 
which  the  news  of  the  surrender  of  Gen.  Lee  and 
his  army  was  received  by  the  people  of  Connersville: 

'"Such  scenes  never  have  and  probably  never  will 
occur  again  in  Connersville  as  were  witnessed  last 
Monday.  The  fall  of  Richmond  was  celebrated  here 
in  a  measiu-e,  but  then  the  cup  of  joy  was  not  yet  full, 
and  the  surrender  of  Lee  and  his  army  remained  to 
assure  our  people  of  the  final  triumph  of  the  glorious 
old  Ai-my  of  the  Potomac,  and  to  make  "assurance 
doubly  sure"  that  the  Rebellion  had  received  its 
death  blow.  Early  on  Monday  morning  the  glad 
news  of  that  great  event  was  borne  us  on  the  telegraph 
wires,  and  our  pen  cannot  portray  the  joy  with  which 
our  citizens  received  the  news  that  the  army  which 
for  four  years  had  given  the  Rebellion  all  its  vitality, 
was  among  the  things  of  the  past,  Demoralized, 
battered  and  broken  it  hadjbeen.  but  our  fondest  hopes 
were  consummated  when  the  bleeding  remnant  of  the 
Army  of  northern  Virginia  laid  down  its  arms  at  the  feet 
of  that  glorious  hero,  U.  S.  Grant.  Upon  the  receipt 
of  the  news  the  first  notes  of  rejoicing  rang  forth 
from  the  church  bells,  which  had  but  the  day  before 


HISTORY   OP   PAYETTE   COUNTY.

called  their  congregations  to  peaceful  worship;  to 
thoae  chimes  were  soon  added  those  of  the  court 
house  bell  and  all  other  bells,  both  large  and  small, 
in  the  town,  and  the  clamor  had  reached  its  climax 
when  guns  and  anvils  joined  in  the  chorus.  The  stores 
were  closed,  everyday  avocations  were  abandoned  in- 
stantly, and  soon  the  whole  population  of  the  city 
were  jammed  into  Monroe  Street.  Then  who  can  de- 
scribe the  scene  that  followed  and  continued  until  far 
into  the  night?  Not  a  countenance  but  bore  a  smile. 
Shouts  upon  shouts  rent  the  air  amid  the  shaking  of 
hands  and  frantic  embraces.  The  people  were  wild 
with  joy.  Col.  Nelson  Trusler  arrived  from  Indian- 
apolis in  the  evening,  and  in  response  to  the  call 
of  his  fellow-citizens  made  a  short  speech  which  a{)tly 
illustrated  the  condition  of  tho  people.  He  said 
he  left  Indianapolis  that  morning  because  everybody 
was  drunk,  and  ho  wanted  to  go  to  some  place  where 
he  could  find  sober  folks;  they  captured  and  detained 
him  awhile  at  Cambridge  City,  but  there  he  found  the 


citizens  drunker   than   they    were   at   Indianapolis; 

Last  Sunday  was  a  glorious  epoch,  and  if  it  wore  not 
a  day  for  which  all  other  days  wore  made,  yet  it  was 
a  day  made  for  generations,  and  our  children  will 
hereafter  hold  it  in  grateful  remembrance  so  long  as 
the  Nation  shall  survive." 

The  Times  of  April  10,  1865,  referring  to  the  as- 
sassination of  President  Abraham  Lincoln,  re- 
marked: 

"Ceremonies  appropriate  of  the  funeral  of  the 
President  of  tho  United  States  were  held  in  all  the 
churches  of  Connorsville  that  are  regularly  open  for 
worship,  yesterday.  The  stillness  and  solemnity  of 
the  Sabbath  prevailed  throughout  the  town.  The 
business  houses  were  closed  the  entire  day,  and 
upon  all  were  the  emblems  of  mourning.  The  court 
house  and  many  private  residences  were  also  draped 
in  mourning.  Such  a  scene  has  never  before  been 
witnessed  in  Connersville."

N 


CONNERSVILLE  is  beautifully  situated  on  the 
west  bank  of  the  West  Fork  of  Whitewater 
River,  occupying  a  natural  terrace  to  the  streams  and 
river  bottoms.  Its  western  and  southwestern  limits 
are  fringed  by  a  range  of  hills,  towering,  perhaps, 
100  feet  above  the  valley,  and  whose  summits  are 
crowned  here  and  there  with  antique  and  more  mod- 
ern suburban  homes,  from  which  is  presented  a  most 
pleasing  view  of  the  city  and  surrounding  country. 
The  city  is  located  near  the  center  of  the  county,  and 
is  distant  by  rail  07.2  miles  a  little  south  of  east  from 
Indianapolis,  and  57.1  miles  northwest  of  Cincinnati, 
Ohio,  lying  in  latitude  39^  30'  north,  and  longitude 
7°  54'  west. 

The  city  was  laid  out  in  March,  1813,  for  John 
Conner,  though  the  original  proprietor  of  the  land 
on  which  the  original  plat  was  made,  as  shown  by  a 
transcript  of  the  original  entry  book,  was  A.  Tharp, 
who  entered  the  northeast  quarter  of  Section  25, 
Town  14,  Range  12  east,  Ajiril  4,  1812.  The  origi- 
nal plat  comprised  only  sixty-two  lots,  which  were 
bounded  on  the  west   by  Monroe   Street,  on   the  east 


by  Water  Street,  and  extended  from  a  little  beyond 
Head  Street  on  the  north  to  a  little  beyond  High 
Street  on  the  south.  The  place  was  laid  ont  in 
Franklin  County  and  the  plat  there  recorded,  which 
it  seems  from  the  records  was  not  transcribed  on  tho 
records  of  Fayette  County  until  in  Oetoljer,  1841. 
Attached  to  the  plat  is  tho  following  descriptive  head- 
ing and  certificate: 

Part  of  town  of  Connersville  first  laid  off  by  John  Con- 
nor. Laid  out  on  the  west  branch  of  W^liitewater,  on  the 
north  side  of  the  river,  on  part  of  the  northeast  quarter  of 
Section  25,  Town  14,  Ranse  13  east,  Second  Principal  Merid- 
ian; course  of  street  running  up  and-  down  tho  river  and 
north  2.^0  east,  commenciufr  at  the  lower  end  of  the  town, 
and  the  other  north  dTP  west,  extending  from  the  river,  and 
all  of  them  four  poles  wide;  tlie  alleys  are  one  pole  wide. 
The  public  grounds  contain  two  blocks  or  four  lots.  Tlie  lots 
are  five  poles  front  and  two  poles  bacli,  each  containing  fifty 
square  perches  of  ground,  and  laid  down  by  a  scale  of  ten 
poles  to  the  inch  by  me,  Knoch  McCarty.

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


plat  is  a  true  representation  of  the  within  described  town  of 
Connersville,  and  further  saith  not. 

Benjamin  Smith,  Justice  of  the  Peace. 

Early  additions  to  the  town  were  made  as  follows: 
In  1817  by  Joshua  Harlan,  embracing  lots  extending 
above  Boundary  (now  Second)  Street,  east  of  Market 
and  south  of  the  alley  above  Head  (now  Sixth)  Street; 
in  1818  by  Joshua  Harlan,  embracing  lots  v^est  of 
Market  Street  to  Tanner,  south  of  Madison,  and  to 
one  street  farther  west  north  of  Madison,  extending 
from  Boundary  along  Market  to  an  alley  between 
Harrison  and  Head  Streets,  the  northern  boundary  of 
these  lots  consisting  of  a  line  from  said  alley  on  the 
south  to  an  alley  on  the  north  between  Madison  and 
Harrison  Streets;  in  1819  by  Joshua  Harlan,  embrac- 
ing lots  south  of  Boundary  Street;  in  1818  by  Dale; 
in  1819  by  Jonathan  McCarty;  in  1819  by  John 
Conner. 

The  public  square,  comprising  the  ground  on 
which  are  now  located  the  court  house  and  city  hall, 
bounded  by  Central  Avenue,  Market,  Court  and 
Fourth  Streets,  was  a  part  of  the  Harlan  plat  of  addi- 
tions to  the  town. 

Mr.  Conner,  the  proprietor  of  the  original  plat  of 
the  town,  some  time  between  the  years  1804  and 
1S08  had  established  a  trading-post  at  this  point 
with  the  Indians.     Hence  the  name  Connersville. 

THE    EARLY    VILLAGE. 

That  the  growth  of  the  village  was  slow  during 
the  first  few  years  of  its  existence  is  evident  from  the 
following,  the  authority  for  which  is  the  late  Dr. 
Philip  Mason: 

"I  came  to  the  valley  of  the  Whitewater  in  the 
spring  of  1816,  and  early  in  the  summer  of  that  year 
I  visited  Connersville.  A  small  tract  of  land  had 
been  laid  off  by  John  Conner  into  town  lots,  which 
lay  along  the  river  bank  on  Water  Street  and  along 
Main  Street,  and  a  few  log-cabins  had  been  erected. 
The  most  of  the  land  which  comprises  the  present 
site  of  the  town  was  then  a  dense  forest.  lu  travel- 
ing up  the  river  to  the  place  there  was  now  and  then 
a  small  opening  to  be'  seen,  with  an  inhabited  log- 
cabin  on  it.  John  Conner,  after  whom  the  town  is 
named,  and  who  owned  the  laud  on  which  it  stands, 
had  built  a  mill  just  above  the  town,  and  not  far 
above  the  site  of  the  present  mill  now  owned  by  A. 
B.  Conwell.      The  town  had  one  small  retail  store." 

Joshua  Harlan  has  been  credited  with  having  kept 
the  first  store  in  Connersville.  This,  of  course,  is 
excepting  the  trading- post  of  Conner,  at  which  a 
bartering  with  the  Indians  had  been  carried  on  for 
years.  The  first  business  house  built  on  the  town 
plat  is  said  to  have  been  a  log  building  which  stood 
on  the  west  side  of  Main  (now  Eastern  Avenue)  Street, 
on  or  near  the  corner  of  the  alley  on  the  site  of  the 


present  dwelling-house  of  the  widow  of  William 
Bunnell.  It  was  in  this  house  that  Mr.  Harlan  kept 
the  store.  He  is  remembered  as  keeping  a  store  in 
that  house  or  vicinity  in  the  summer  of  1815,  and  it 
is  not  unlikely  that  it  was  the  Harlan  store,  to  which 
reference  is  made  in  1816  by  Dr.  Mason.  Judge 
Harlan,  as  he  was  styled,  having  served  as  a  Judge 
under  Territorial  Government,  was  a  native  of  Ches- 
ter County,  Penn.,  born  in  1763.  In  1793  he  settled 
in  Kentucky  and  there  lived  until  1810,  when  he 
immigrated  to  Brookville,  and  in  1813  to  the  site  of 
Connersville.  He  has  been  described  as  a  tall  man, 
fully  six  feet  two  inches.  He  was  a  man  of  strong 
and  clear  mind.  In  about  1820  he  built  a  brick 
house  on  the  northea.st  corner  of  what  is  now  Eastern 
Avenue  and  Fifth  Street — the  site  of  the  "Buckley 
House  " — which  is,  in  fact,  the  old  house  enlarged 
and  remodeled.  In  this  building  Judge  Harlan  kept 
one  of  "ye  olden  time  inns"  for  a  number  of  years. 
His  death  occurred  at  Connersville,  September  15, 
1827. 

In  1817  the  Claypool  brothers,  Newton  and  Solo- 
mon, young  unmarried  men,  came  to  the  village,  and 
perhaps  for  a  time  carried  on  a  little  bartering  trade 
with  the  Indians  and  the  few  white  settlers.  Solo- 
mon soon  engaged  in  farming,  and  Newton  embarked 
in  the  tavern  business.  The  late  Hon.  Oliver  H. 
Smith,  in  alluding  to  Mr.  Clayjwol  as  a  landlord, 
said:  "  When  I  arrived  at  Connersville  in  May,  1820, 
I  stopped  at  the  hotel  of  Newton  Claypool.  He  was 
about  my  age.  I  had  been  licensed  to  practice  in 
March  before,  and  was  looking  for  a  location.  My 
last  dollar  had  escaped  from  the  top  of  my  pocket. 
Breakfast  over,  I  met  Mr.  Claypool  in  the  bar  room; 
as  we  met  I  remarked,  '  Look  at  me  and  see  whether 
you  will  risk  me  for  my  board  a  year.'  '  Who  are 
you?  Where  did  you  come  from?  What  is  your 
trade  and  how  do  you  expect  to  pay  for  your  board?' 
'My  name  is  Smith;  I  am  from  Lawrenceburg;  I  am 
a  young  lawyer,  and  I  expect  to  pay  you  from  my 
practice.'  'Rather  a  bad  chance,  but  I  will  risk 
you'  Mr.  Smith  remarked  that  at  the  time  it  was  the 
only  hotel  in  the  village.     (The  board  was  paid.) 

From  an  inscription  on  a  tombstone  in  the  ceme- 
tery at  Connersville  it  appears  that  the  Claypools 
were  Virginians;  that  they  immigrated  with  their 
father,  Abraham  Claypool,  to  the  Sciota  Valley,  Ohio, 
in  1798,  thence  in  1808  to  Clermont  County,  in 
the  same  State,  and  thence  to  Connersville  in  1817. 

Silas  Ford,  from  Virginia,  came  to  the  village  in 
1817.  He  was  by  trade  a  wheelwright,  which  he  fol- 
lowed for  a  time  here  and  subsequently  on  William's 
Creek.  He  also  kept  for  a  time  a  house  of  entertain- 
ment. 

Joseph  Nelson,  a  young  man  from  Pennsylvania, 


HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

and  by  trade  a  saddler,  settled  at  Gonnersville  in 
1819,  and  at  once  opened  a  saddler  shop,  the  first  in 
the  place. 

Arthur  Dickson  had  settled  here  prior  to  this 
date,  and  was  engaged  in  merchandising. 

In  1819  Benjamin  Berry  was  having  erected  for  his 
dwelling-house  the  building  on  the  northwest  corner 
of  Eastern  Avenue  and  Fifth  Street,  and  so  soon  as 
completed  Austin  Bishop  opened  a  store  in  one  end  of 
it.  Absalom  Burkham  built  the  Heineman  corner. 
Among  the  early  built  brick  houses  of  the  village 
which  were  in  process  of  construction  that  year  and 
the  year  following  were  the  hotel  building  of  Joshua 
Harlan,  heretofore  designated;  the  house  where 
Charles  Mount  resides,  by  Absalom  Burkham;  thehouse 
on  the  southwest  corner  of  Central  Avenue  and  Fourth 
Street;  the  old  United  States  Hotel  building,  which 
stood  on  Central  Avenue  opposite  the  court  house; 
and  the  house  of  George  Reed,  next  south  to  the 
building  described,  on  the  corner  opposite  "  Huston 
House." 

Jonathan  John,  from  Kentucky,  settled  in  1816  on 
the  site  of  the  McFarlan  residence,  on  the  western 
border  of  the  city.  The  father  of  Amos  R.  Edwards) 
from  Pennsylvania,  settled  in  Gonnersville  in  1817; 
and  in  1819  Douglas  Burton  and  family,  coming  from 
Kentucky  here,  though  previously  having  emigrated 
from  South  Carolina. 

At  this  period  those  engaged  in  keeping  tavern  or 
merchandising  were  required  to  make  application  for 
a  license  for  the  same.  In  1819  the  County  Com- 
missioners granted  a  tavern  license  to  Newton  Clay- 
pool  and  George  Reed,  and  in  1820  to  Joshua  Harlan 
and  Archibald  Reed.  The  rate  charged  per  annum 
was  $10. 

In  the  spring  of  1821  Connersville  from  a  busi- 
ness standpoint  made  about  the  following  exhibit: 
Arthur  Dixon  kept  a  dry  goods  store  on  Main  Street 
one  door  south  of  the  Heineman  corner.  Austin  Bishop 
had  a  grocery  on  the  opposite  corner,  where  the  Mur- 
phy Bros,  are  now  following  the  same  business. 
Joshua  Harlan  was  keeping  a  tavern  on  the  present 
site  of  the  "Buckley  House."  John  Sample,  Sr. ,  had 
an  inn  on  the  Heineman  corner.  Newton  Claypool 
kept  a  house  of  entertainment  on  the  east  side  of 
Main  Street  on  the  south  corner  of  the  alley.  Archi- 
bald Reed  a  similar  house  (tavern)  in  the  building 
now  occupied  by  J.  Bailey  on  the  west  side  of  Cen- 
tral Avenue.  Absalom  Berkham,  another  inn-keeperi 
held  forth  in  the  building  where  Charles  Mount  now 
resides,  on  the  east  side  of  Central  Avenue.  Silas 
Ford,  the  father  of  Gayle,  kept  hotel  on  the  site  of 
the  present  residence  of  the  widow  of  William  Bun- 
nell, on  the  west  side  of  Eastern  Avenue,  on  the  south 
corner  of  the  alley.   Bartholomew  McCleary  was  carry- 


ing on  a  store  on  the  southeast  corner  of  Monroe  and 
Harrison  Streets.  Barnet  and  Jonas  Levi  had  a  jew- 
elry store  on  the  east  side  of  Monroe  Street  between 
Madison  and  Harrison  Streets.  A  Mr.  Bouton  carried 
on  a  cooper-shop  on  about  the  site  of  the  Widow 
George  Scott's  residence.  Just  south  of  Bailey's  store 
was  located  the  saddle-shop  of  Joseph  Nelson.  Where 
the  First  National  Bank  now  is  was  the  blacksmith- 
shop  of  Martin  Remington.  One  Rankin  was  the 
hatter,  and  carried  on  the  business  in  a  house  situated 
nearly  opposite  the  Claypool  tavern.  William  W. 
Wick  was  keeping  the  old  United  States  Tavern. 
David  Beck  was  a  tailor  and  held  forth  on  Monroe 
Street,  where  yet  some  of  his  descendants  reside. 
Jacob  Vandegrift  carried  on  a  blacksmith-shop. 

William  Curry  was  another  blacksmith,  whose 
shop  was  situated  on  the  east  side  alley  on  north 
side  of  Harrison  Street.  William  Burnett  and  Julius 
Whitmer  were  carpenters,  located,  the  former,  where 
the  Presbyterian  Church  now  is.  John  D.  Stewart, 
who  that  spring  (1821)  with  family  emigrated  from 
Pennsylvania,  erected  a  house  for  a  shoe  shop  on  the 
corner  of  Harrison  and  Monroe  Streets  (where  the 
Conwell  Block  now  stands).  Messrs.  Stebbins  &amp;  Ball 
carried  on  a  pottery  at  the  south  end  of  the  village. 
Oliver  H.  Smith  and  William  W.  Wick  were  the 
resident  attorneys,  and  Dr.  Joseph  MoflStt  the  phy- 
sician. The  latter's  office  was  located  about  where 
the  dry  goods  store  of  Theodore  Griffis  now  is.  John 
Conner  had  in  full  blast  a  saw  and  grist-mill  and  dis- 
tillery, and  was  also  interested  in  other  branches  of 
business.  A.  B.  Conwell  was  just  preparing  his 
tanyard  for  business.  Mr.Rees  had  a  tannery  located 
on  Tanner  Street,  west  side,  not  far  from  the  end  of 
the  street.  Asher  Cox,  Edmund  I.  Kidd  and  Harvey 
Bates  had  in  operation  a  carding  and  fulling  machine 
on  the  west  side  of  the  river,  at  the  end  of  Fourth 
Street.  At  this  time  there  was  no  church  building 
or  schoolhouse  in  the  village,  yet  the  circuit  preach- 
ers of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  visited  the 
place  occasionally. 

Parties  granted  license  to  vend  merchandise  or 
keep  tavern  in  the  village  from  1821  to  1830,  are  the

Many  of  these  licenses  were  renewed  from  year 
to  year  for  quite  a  period. 

Among  other  business  interests  of  the  village  up 
to  1830  were  the  tin,  sheet-iron  and  copper  manu- 
factory of  J.  Dawson.  Messrs.  Hull  &amp;  Fearis  were 
saddlers;  John  Willey,  meat-market;  Merrifield  &amp; 
Miller,  hatters;  later  the  firm  was  R.  &amp;  R.  Merrifield. 
Christian  Beck  was  the  gunsmith.  H.  Goodlander 
was  another  of  the  jewelers.  A.  Van  Vleet  for  a 
time  carried  on  weaving,  and  some  time  later  Hiram 
Bundy  was  likewise  engaged  in  the  weaving  business. 
An  oil-mill  was  operated  by  either  John  Perin  or 
Lyman  Carpenter;  A.  Conklin  &amp;  W.  H.  Coombs  were 
carrying  on  a  chair  factory.  Thomas  Rutter  was  a 
hatter  and  one  Frisbee  a  tanner.  The  Merrifield  hat 
factory  was  located  on  Monroe  Street,  three  doors 
north  of  the  Connersville  Hotel;  George  W.  Parks, 
a  blacksmith;  George  W.  Reed  was  a  tailor;  Nicholas 
Baker  a  shoe-maker.  J.  Hart  carried  on  a  tin-shop. 
Silas  Ford  was  manufacturing  spinning-wheels.  Rob- 
ert GrifSs  was  in  the  saddlery  and  harness  trade. 
John  McCoy  was  another  dealer  in  hats,  and  on  the 
north  end  of  Monroe  Street  was  situated  the  factory 
of  Isaac  Wood,  who  was  engaged  in  making  spinning 
wheels. 

Up  until  1830  there  was  but  one  newspaper  pub- 
lished in  the  village,  the  Fayette  Observer.  In  1824 
was  erected  a  house  of  worship  by  the  Methodists, 
the  first  and  only  church  edifice  in  the  place  durino- 
the  decade  closing  with  1830.  The  seminary  build- 
ing was  not  erected  until  1828-29,  it  being  the  first 
regular  school  building  in  the  village. 

John  Sample  was  Postmaster  in  1826  and  re- 
quested "all  letters  and  packages  to  be  sent  in  the 
mail  to  be  in  the  office  half  an  hour  before  the  mails 
closed."  That  summer  the  arrival  and  departure  of 
the  mails  from  the  postoffice  in  Connersville  were: 
Eastern  mail  arrives  on  Thursdays  1 1  o'clock  A.  M. 
and  departs  west  in  half  an  hour.  Western  mail 
arrives  on  Tuesdays  11  o'clock  A.  M.  and  departs 
east  at  12  o'clock  M.  Southern  mail  arrives  on  Fri- 
days at  9  o'clock  A.  M.jand  departs  north  at  10  o'clock 
A.  M. 


As  early  as  1820  there  was  a  circulating  library 
in  the  village,  and  in  November,  1825,  was  opened 
to  the  public  the  Fayette  County  Library.  One  year 
later  it  contained  151  select  volumes  and  was  soon  to 
be  augumented  by  about  125  volumes.  It  was  under 
the  management  of  a  Board  of  Trustees,  of  which 
Daniel  Rench  was  Secretary.  The  library  was  open 
every  Saturday  afternoon  from  1  to  6  o'clock.  The 
Secretary  gave  notice  in  the  Observer  that  "  there  are 
volumes  in  the  library  to  suit  the  taste  and  inquir- 
ies of  all.  The  citizens,  we  hope,  will  not  be  slow  in 
availing  themselves  of  its  great  advantages,  which  may 
be  had  for  50  cents  a  year.  All  citizens  over  sixteen 
years  may  draw  books,  by  giving  bond  and  security 
for  damages,  etc.  The  rules  governing  drawers  are 
public  in  the  library  room.'' 

Over  the  date  of  June  17,  1826,  in  a  copy  of  the 
Observer,  and  over  the  signatures  of  Kidd  &amp;  Cox 
appeared  the  following  advertisement:  "Wool  Card- 
ing— The  undersigned  return  their  grateful  acknowl- 
edgments for  the  liberal  support  they  have  heretofore- 
received,  and  now  inform  the  public  that  their 
machines  are  in  complete  operation,  and  ready  to 
receive  wool,  which  they  will  card  in  the  best  manner, 
and  on  the  shortest  notice. 

"  Every  exertion  will  be  made  to  accommodate 
persons  living  at  a  distance.  The  following  articles 
of  produce  will  be  received  in  payment:  wool,  sugar, 
linen,  beeswax,  flax,  wheat,  tallow,  etc." 

In  the  Observer  under  date  of  February,  1830,  J. 
M.  Ray,  as  agent,  advertised  that  ' '  on  May  26  would 
be  offered  for  sale  Conner's  grist-mill,  saw-mill,  dis- 
tillery and  mill  farm  adjoining  Connersville,  the 
farm  below  town,  the  tavern  and  store  stands  oppo- 
site the  court  house  in  said  town  and  some  out-lots 
in  the  vicinity. 

"  Mill  farm  about  eighty  acres  cleared  land  under 
good  fence.  The  mills  and  distillery  are  in  fine  oper- 
ation, and  the  tavern  stand  occupied  by  Capt.  Sam- 
ple, and  the  store  room  by  Messrs.  Hankins  &amp;  Mount. 
*  *  The  whole  property  is  now  under  rent  at 
$600  per  annum,  cash.         *         *" 

This  notice  was  to  be  sent  to  the  Ohio  State  Jour- 
nal at  Columbus,  Ohio,  and  to  the  Commentator  at 
Frankfort,  Ky.,  for  publication. 

March  1,  1830,  the  following  notice  was  issued 
under  the  title  of  "  Regimental  Orders:" 

Captains  commanrling  companies  ia  tlie  Eleventh  Reg- 
iment of  the  Indiana  Jlilitia,  are  hereby  ordered  to  attend  the

Court  of  Assessment  Id  Connersville  on  the  first  Monday  of

Having  thus  far  given  in  a  general  way  a  glance 
of  the  village  up  to  1S30,  we  will  return  to  the  begin- 
ning of  the  decade,  when  it  may  be  said  Connersville 
began  to  grow,  and  consider  briefly  the  status  of 
things  then  with  the  figuring  characters. 

Then  resided  here  auch  men  as  Joshua  Harlan, 
Arthur  Dixon,  Newton  Claypool,  John  Sample,  Jona- 
than MoCarty,  James  M.  Ray,  Oliver  H.  Smith,  Will- 
iam W.  Wick,  Jonathan  John,  Samuel  C.  Sample, 
George  Frybarger,  A.  B.  Conwell,  and  some  lateri 
Marks  Crume,  Martin  M.  Ray,  Samuel  W.  Parker, 
Caleb  B.  Smith  and  Daniel  Hankins — future  Legis- 
lators and  Senators,  a  Judge,  members  of  Congress, 
a  United  States  Senator,  a  Cabinet  officer,  a  Govern- 
or and  business  men  of  great  capacity.  In  the 
hands  of  such  men  it  is  no  wonder  that  the  village 
became  progressive  and  interesting.  An  anecdote 
will  "serve  to  illustrate  the  peculiar  talents  of  the 
taverns  heretofore  referredto.  An  old  Englishman, 
by  the  name  of  John  Knipe,  was  asked  by  a  traveler 
who  kept  the  best  hotel.  "  We'el,  hif  thee  wants  good 
grub,  go  to  Samples;  hif  thee  wants  thy  'oss  we'll 
cared,  go  to  Claypool's;  and  hif  thee  wants  gude 
whisky,  thee  will  better  stop  at  'Arlans." 

It  is  only  our  purpose  here  to  refer  briefly  to  a 
few  of  the  early  business  men  of  the  village,  who 
figured  conspicuously  and  largely  in  the  greater  bus- 
iness interests  of  Connersville,  and  whose  advent  into 
her  business  circles  marked  an  era  in  her  history, 
leaving  men  of  other  vocations  for  consideration  in 
other  parts  of  this  volume. 

Of  the  men  in  question,  Newton  Claypool  was  a 
native  of  Virginia,  where  born  in  1795,  though  at  an 
early  day  with  his  father  removed  to  Ohio,  and  in 
1817  settled  in  Connersville.  In  1818  he  returned 
temporarily  to  Ohio,  and  was  married  to  Mary  Kerns, 
of  Ross  County.  Rather  than  one  of  the  early  bus- 
iness men  of  Connersville,  Mr.  Claypool  was  a  tavern 
keeper  until  in  1836,  when  he  purchased  and  re- 
moved to  the  farm  just  north  of  the  city  limits,  upon 
which  his  son,  Austin  B.  Claypool,  now  resides.  He 
was  elected  to  the  Legislature,  first  in  1825,  and  to 
the  Senate  first  in  1828,  and  subsequently  served  a 
number  of  years  in  each  branch. 

The  late  Hon.  Oliver  H.  Smith  thus  alludes  to 
him  in  this  connection :  "  He  was  one  of  the  most 
efficient  men  of  the  Legislature  for  many  years.  His 
greatest  forte  was  in  his  practical  knowledge  applied 
to  the  subject  by  his  strong  common  sense.  For  many 
years  he  was  closely  identified  with  the  banking  bus- 
iness   of   this   community."     Another    writer    thus 


alludes  to  him :  "  Luck  ^vas  not  one  of  Newton  Clay- 
pool's  words.  It  was  not  in  his  lexicon.  He  did 
but  little  on  faith  either — had  his  own  philosophy, 
both  of  church  and  State.  He  fought  all  of  his  ene- 
mies with  the  same  weapon.  He  was  a  consistent 
enemy  of  the  Democratic  party,  through  a  life  longer 
than  is  usually  allotted  to  a  man.  It  can  be  said  of 
him  that  he  was  eminently  successful  as  a  financier, 
in  earlier  life  as  an  economist  and  producer,  as  well 
as  in  after  life  as  a  banker.  In  this  latter  capacity 
his  reputation  was  brilliant  and  enviable  throughout 
the  State."  He  died  at  Indianapolis,  Ind.,  May  14, 
1866. 

George  Frybarger  came  to  Connersville  from  the 
city  of  Dayton,  Ohio,  in  the  year  1821,  and  opened 
a  dry  goods  store.  "  Like  most  of  the  early  settlers 
he  was  fearless  and  self-reliant,  and  entered  itpon  the 
duties  of  his  calling  with  decided'purposes  of  useful- 
ness and  accumulation.  His  industry"  and  energy 
gave  him  success,  and  for  many  years  he  ranked 
among  the  foremost  merchants  and  traders  of  the 
Whitewater  Valley.  It  has  been  said  that,  perhaps, 
there  was  never  a  man  in  Connersville  who  knew  the 
business  as  well  as  Frybarger,  none  at  least  who  did 
so  much  business  as  he.  There  can  be  no  doubt  but 
the  ruling  trait  and  the  carefully  guarded  ambition 
of  George  Frybarger  was  honesty.  Even  to  the  minut- 
est details  of  ever  raging  trade  throughout  a  long 
life  of  successful  mercantile  pursuits  he  adhered  in 
theory  and  in  practice  to  his  passion — honesty.  The 
charity  of  Mr.  Frybarger  was  in  business,  that  is,  he 
was  charitable  to  those  that  deserved  it.  He  loaned 
to  the  unfortunate  honest;  he  gave,  too,  and  encour- 
aged with  his  advice  and  credit  and  means,  stimulat- 
ing them  to  all  the  demands  of  success.  He  had  an 
unbounded  credit  at  home  and  abroad.  He  always 
kept  safely  stored  in  his  vaults  coin  to  put  against 
his  credit.  He  is  said  to  have  been  the  first  man  in 
the  West  in  a  crisis,  well  remembered  in  the  commer- 
cial world,  to  promptly  pay  his  Eastern  debts  with 
coin  stored  for  the  purpose  of  adversity."  From  an 
inscription  on  his  tombstone  it  appears  that  he  was 
born  in  1797  and  died  in  1853. 

A.  B.  Conwell  was  born  in  Delaware  in  1796,  and 
at  the  age  of  fifteen  was  apprenticed  as  a  tanner,  at 
which  he  served  five  years.  In  1817  he,  with  a 
brother,  walked  from  Washington,  D.C.  to  Pittsburgh, 
where  they  separated,  A.  B.  going  to  Kentucky,  and 
in  1821  he  located  in  Connersville,  and  began  his 
successful  career  on  an  acre  of  ground  which  he  pur- 
chased of  John  Conner,  upon  which  he  put  in  opera- 
tion a  tannery,  which  business  he  subsequently  aban- 
doned and  engaged  in  mercantile  pursuits.  He  was 
for  years  engaged  in  the  milling  business,  and  erected 
and  carried  on  one  of  the  most  extensive   flouring-

HISTORY    OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


mills  in  this  section  of  the  State.  The  large  mill 
building  on  North  Eastern  Avenue  is  a  monument  to 
his  enterprise.  For  a  number  of  years  pork-packing 
claimed  his  attention,  which  business  he  carried  on 
on  a  large  scale.  He  is  the  last  of  the  four  Romans 
of  whom  we  speak  in  this  connection,  who  still  lives 
as  a  connecting  link  between  the  past  and  present. 
A  man  of  wonderful  natural  intellect  and  judgment, 
he  has  ever  been  known  for  his  wise  forecast  as  well 
as  for  his  quiet  success  in  all  his  business  and  spec- 
ulations. 

Daniel  Hankins  settled  in  ConnersviJle  in  1827, 
six  years  later  than  Frybarger  and  Conwell,  yet  he 
figured  in  the  latter  part  of  the  decade  of  which  we 
wi'ite.  Col.  Hankins,  as  he  was  called,  was  a  native 
of  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  born  in  1795  and  died  in 
1860.  He  commenced  as  a  dry  goods  merchant  in  the 
village  and  continued  so  throughout  an  active  busi- 
ness life.  He  was  possessed  of  great  activity  and 
energy.  A  writer  has  given  as  his  great  powers, 
"untiring  industry,  coupled  with  worthy  ambition; 
a  restless  eager  spirit,  he  was  a  fretful  business  man. 
Dull  times  only  conquered  him."  He  engaged  exten- 
sively iu  speculation,  pork  and  grain  receiving  his 
attention  in  large  investments.  His  influence  is  said 
to  have  been  great  because  his  trade  was  great.  In 
1830  he,  with  Marks  Grume,  represented  the  county 
in  the  Legislature.  His  name  and  power  and  enterprise 
will  not  soon  perish.  In  speaking  of  his  death  the 
editor  of  the  Times  said:  "He  accumulated  a  vast 
property.  Had  a  farm  of  1,400  acres  north  of  Con- 
nersville,  which  he  superintended  while  his  attention 
was  largely  engrossed  with  the  extensive  mercantile 
trade  and  speculations  in  pork  and  flour.  Perhaps  no 
man  of  one  county  has  ever  managed  as  much  busi- 
ness, and  managed  it  all  as  correctly  and  successfully 
as  has  Col.  Hankins."  It  has  also  been  stated  in 
print  that  "he  was  to  Connersville  what  A.  T.  Stewart 
was  to  New  York — a  merchant  prince.  But  few  men 
possessed  a  finer  sense  of  honor,  and  none  surpassed 
him  in  mercantile  integrity." 

INDEPENDENCE    DAY,    1831. 

The  4th  of  July,  1831,  was  observed  by  the  citi- 
zens of  the  village  and  county  by  a  celebration  at  a 
grove  about  one-half  mile  below  Connersville. 

The  day  was  ushered  in  by  the  firing  of  cannon. 
A  procession  was  formed  in  front  of  the  court  house, 
led  by  the  military,  and  marched  to  the  grove,  where 
some  3,000  persons  had  assembled.  The  Marshals  of 
the  day  were  Col.  Caldwell  and  N.  McClure,  and  the 
ofiicers  in  charge  of  the  exercises  were  John  Hub- 
bell,  President;  Allen  Crisler,  Vice-President;  Eev. 
William  Miller,  Chaplain;  S.  W.  Parker,  Orator; 
James  Ross,  reader;  prayer  was  offered  by  the  Chap- 


lain, which  was  followed  by  the  reading  of  the  Dec- 
laration of  Independence;  next  came  a  volley  from 
the  artillery;  then  music,  which  was  followed  by  an 
oration;  music  and  firing  of  the  artillery  followed, 
which  closed  the  exercises  of  the  morning.  An  excel- 
lent dinner  was  served  at  the  grove  by  Newton  Clay- 
pool,  where  some  fourteen  toasts  were  drank.  The 
day  was  fine,  though  a  shower  fell  just  as  the  exercises 
were  closing.  In  the  evening  a  ball  was  held  at  the 
Claypool  tavern. 

THE    STATUS    OF    CONNERSVILLE    IN    1833. 

In  the  "Indiana  Gazetteer"  of  1833  the  village  of 
Connersville  is  given  a  population  of  500  inhabitants. 
It  comprised  seven  mercantile  stores,  one  drug  store, 
four  taverns,  had  four  physicians,  four  lawyers  and 
two  printing  offices,  besides  mechanics  of  all  kinds. 

On  Saturday,  April  20,  of  the  above  year,  was  pub- 
lished in  the  Indiana  Sentinel,  edited  by  C.  B.  Smith 
and  M.  R.  Hull,  under  the  title  "Our  Town"  the 
following: 

"This  place  is  truly  in  a  flourishing  condition. 
The  citizens  are  quite  as  industrious  as  any  others 
in  the  great  West;  and  complete  marks  of  their  per- 
severing habits  are  displayed  on  every  street.  New 
houses  are  in  successive  building;  and  the  hum  and 
buzz  of  business  is  made  to  resound  in  the  distant 
valley,  and  to  the  approaching  traveler  bespeaks  the 
industry  of  mechanics.  Our  merchants  are  receiving 
daily  thousands  of  dollars  worth  of  goods.  The 
spring  sales  progress  with  much  vigor,  which  makes 
the  active  salesman  skip  the  counter  with  a  business- 
like spirit.  Our  physicians  (poor  fellows)  have  but 
little  to  do;  they  droop  their  heads  beneath  the  influ- 
ence of  general  health.  Our  streets  present  a  lively 
picture  of  enterprise  and  industry.  While  other 
presses  are  falling  out  with  their  subscribers,  and 
placing  their  names  on  the  "black  list,"  the  Sentinel 
still  holds  an  undiminished  patronage,  and  its  con- 
ductors continue,  daily,  to  place  good  names  on  their 
white  list.  Ail  this  prosperity  we  owe,  in  a  great 
measure,  to  the  farmers  of  Indiana — 'the  staff  of  life.' 
But  a  few  years  of  such  prosperity,  and  Connersville 
will  become  the  most  flourishing  village  in  the  West- 
ern country." 

THE  SUCCEEDING  DECADE. 

During  the  following  ten  years  the  village  kept 
on  in  the  even  tenor  of  its  way,  making  no  particular 
stir  in  the  way  of  industries,  yet  increasing  gradually 
in  numbers  and  business  and  quietly  laying  the  foun- 
dation upon  which  was  to  be  built  a  city  that  occupies 
a  prominent  place  in  the  sisterhood  of  eastern  Indi- 
ana cities. 

The  event  of  the  decade  was  the  passage  of  the 
great  Internal  Improvement  Bill  for  the  State  of  In-

diana,  at  the  head  of  which  stood  the  Whitewater 
Valley  Canal  Bill,  which  was  to  mark  an  era  in  the 
history  of  all  villages  and  towns  along  its  proposed 
path.  The  date  of  the  passage  of  this  bill  was  Jan- 
uary 16,  1836,  the  news  of  which  was  received  at 
Connersville  on  Monday,  the  18th  inst.,  and  as  soon 
as  twilight  came  on,  the  village,  with  scarcely  the  ex- 
ception of  a  building,  was  in  a  brilliant  blaze  of  il- 
lumination. The  coi;rt  house  was  lighted  up  from 
the  basement  into  the  steeple. 

About  sundown  the  cannon  of  the  village  was 
hauled  out  to  the  canal  line  and  six  guns  fired — one 
in  honor  of  the  Governor,  one  to  the  Senator  and  one 
to  each  of  the  Representatives  of  the  county  in  the 
General  Assembly  and  one  to  the  Whitewater  Valley 
Canal. 

In  the  eveniner  a  meeting  was  held  at  the  court 
house  which  was  addressed  by  Hon.  O.  H.  Smith  and 
Samuel  W.  Parker.  A  number  of  toasts  were  drank, 
after  which  the  whole  assembly  repaired  to  the  river 
bank  east  of  the  village,  which  was  yet  brilliantly 
lighted  up  with  a  number  of  bon-iires  and  under  the 
illumination  of  the  buildings.  About  9  o'clock  an 
accident  occurred  by  the  premature  explosion  of  a 
piece  of  artillery,  by  which  four  young  men  were  ter- 
ribly maimed  and  wounded.  Alexander  Saxon  had 
one  arm  torn  off  and  the  other  so  badly  wounded  that 
both  were  immediately  amputated  above  the  elbow. 
His  eyes  were  completely  blown  out  of  his  head  and 
his  death  resulted  the  next  morning.  Joseph  Clark 
had  his  right  arm  blown  off,  and  Abiather  Williams 
and  William  Worster  were  severely  burnt. 

The  canal  was  completed  to  Connersville  in  June, 
1845,  and  the  first  boat  to  reach  the  village  was  the 
"Patriot,"  commanded  by  Capt.  Gayle  Ford,  which 
arrived  in  the  fall  of  that  year. 

The  imports  and  exports  on  the  canal  for  the  week 
ending  November  20,  1845  (from  the  village)  were  as 
follows: 

Exports.    Imports. 

Wheat,  number  of  bushels 1,506      

Cider,  barrels 13       

Industries  (pounds). 6,010      8,993 

Merchandise  (pounds) 8,189 

Salt  and  castings  (pounds) 150 

Lumber  (feet)  700 

An  effort  for  the  incorporation  of  the  village 
seems  to  have  been  made  in  1834.  but  it  must  have 
proven  a  failure,  as  the  act  of  the  Legislature  incor- 
porating Connersville  was  approved  February  15, 
1841,  by  which  act  Joshua  Mcintosh,  Aquila  Hattan, 
George  Frybarger,  Robert  Swift  and  John  Noble  were 
appointed   Trustees  of  the  "town  of  Connersville." 

BEMINISCENOES. 

Over  the  signature  of  "Rambler,"  in  the  county 
press  of  1870  appeared   the  following  reminiscences 


of  the  village,  which  will  undoubtedly  be  of  interest 
to  some,  and  serve  to  keep  up  the  chain  of  the  early 
history  of  Connersville: 

"  While  standing  in  the  rear  of  the  school  build- 
ing, taking  a  view  of  the  landscape  there  presented, 
the  past  comes  in  view  to  the  memory,  and  many  in- 
cidents of  schoolboy  days  comes  fresh  to  my  mind 
that  occurred  forty  years  ago,  and  changes  are  visible 
at  every  turn. 

"  The  road  leading  east  from  town  was  then  on 
the  high  ground  north  of  Conwell's  Mill,  then  down 
by  the  old  saw-mill  directly  east,  crossing  the  river 
a  short  distance  below  the  railroad  bridge,  and 
intersecting  the  present  road  at  the  old  McCann 
homestead.        *         *        *        *         *        *        * 

"  The  first  grist-mill  in  the  county  was  erected  by 
John  Conner,  below  the  house  named,  and  about  300 
yards  east  of  the  present  mill  (or  structure).  Conner 
sold  the  mill  to  DeCamp,  and  he  to  Conwell,  who  ran 
the  same  until  it  was  worn  out.  That  old  mill 
was  familiar  to  all  the  pioneers  for  many  miles 
around.  Going  to  mill  was  a  task  in  those  days,  and 
often  a  trip  of  forty  or  fifty  miles  on  horseback. 
Each  grist  was  numbered,  and  frequently  was  several 
days  awaiting  its  turn,  while  a  number  of  the  cus- 
tomers would  be  in  camp  close  by.  The  Saturdays  of 
our  boyhood  days  were  spent  in  ramblings,  and  as  a 
guest  of  Lafe  Conwell,  our  schoolmate  at  that  time, 
that  old  mill  was  examined  with  boyish  curiosity,  and 
its  mysteries  solved.  In  after  years,  when  there  with 
grists,  we  wore  more  interested  in  seeing  the  miller 
manipulate  the  toll  dish.  The  honesty, of  the  miller 
is  proverbial,  but  they  were  sometimes  absent-mind- 
ed, and  would  repeat  the  operation  of  taking  toll, 
and  have  been  known  to  forget  that  important  pro- 
ceeding, as  I  have  received,  as  the  product  of  grist,  a 
range  of  from  twenty  eight  pounds  to  forty-six 
pounds  of  flour  to  each  bushel  of  wheat  at  that  same 
old  mill. 

"  Mr.  Conwell  had  a  lanyard  not  far  from  the 
grist-mill,  and  for  a  while  furnished  quite  an  object 
of  interest  to  the  boys,  as  well  as  the  '  children  of 
larger  growth '  that  frequented  the  place.  A.  pet  bear 
was  utilized,  and  labored  faithfully  by  working  a 
tread- mill,  thereby  pumping  water  to  fill  the  vats. 
These  incidents  may  not  interest  the  youth  of  the 
present  day,  or  the  stranger  who  may  be  taking  a 
view  of  the  surroundings,  as  all  traces  of  the  old 
grist-mill,  the  saw-mill,  the  tan-yard,  the  bridge 
across  the  race  and  the  ford  are  gone,  but  there  are 
some  persons  left  iu  the  vicinity  with  whom  the  state- 
ment will  call  up  pleasant  memories. 

"  The  incidents  of  early  days,  as  related  by  the 
original  pioneers,  always  created  a  lively  interest,  and 
often  a  happy  delight.     I  remember   of  hearing  old

HISTOKY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Aleck  Hamilton  tell  about  a  sneaking,  thieving  In- 
dian who  was  regarded  as  a  nuisance,  and  while  out 
hunting  on  the  hill  northwest  of  town  one  day  he  got 
sight  of  the  fellow  and  tracked  him  into  a  pond  in 
the  vicinity  of  Cal.  Burton's.  But  he  never  could 
find  any  tracks  whither  the  Indian  came  out,  and 
from  the  comical  expression  as  he  finished  his  story, 
we  inferred  that  he  helped  the  Indian  to  make  those 
tracks,  as  last  seen. 

"  Col.  Frybarger  can  tell  about  having  witnessed 
a  savage  encounter  with  a  wolf  by  several  men  and 
dogs,  and  the  wolf  was  killed  on  the  street,  about 
opposite  Frank  Dale's  property.  That  happened 
about  the  year  1827  or  1828. 

"I  have  heard  Jonathan  John,  Sr. ,  tell  about 
when  he  came  to  this  county,  discouraged  and 
heart  sick,  they  remained  in  camp  for  three  weeks 
without  unloading  their  movables,  intending  day 
after  day  to  start  back  to  old  Kentucky.  Finally 
they  became  more  reconciled,  and  settled  on  the  hill 
northwest  of  town,  and  never  had  cause  to  regret  the 
choice.  The  excellent  spring  at  the  foot  of  the  hill 
below  the  John's  house  was  the  inducement  to  create 
the  famous  camping  ground  in  the  vicinity,  and  one 
of  the  principal  Indian  trails  leading  to  the  north- 
west passed  by  there  and  in  the  direction  of  Harrie- 
burg.  The  principal  trail  from  Cincinnati  and 
Brookville  came  up  the  east  fork  from  Brookville  to 
Fairfield,  then  up  Ellis  Creek,  through  by  Everton, 
and  crossed  the  river  at  the  ford  south  of  town,  and 
on  as  stated.  Those  Indian  trails  were  used  by  the 
early  settlers,  and  improved  for  wagon  roads  until 
the  lands  were  surveyed  and  enclosed.  The  rising  gen- 
eration can  form  but  little  idea  of  the  unbroken  for- 
est, especially  in  the  low  lands,  where  it  was  almost 
impenetrable,  so  thick  were  the  timber,  bushes  and 
vines.  There  was  an  important  trail  up  the  valley 
with  a  camping  ground  on  the  Larkin  Sims  place, 
near  the  excellent  spring  of  water  there. 

"  I  remember  when  we  boys  watched  down  street 
for  the  stage  coach  coming  as  evening  approached, 
and  listened  for  the  notes  of  the  bugle  horn.  Some- 
times we  would  go  down  and  meet  the  coach  at  the 
ford  of  the  river  opposite  where  Root's  foundry  now 
stands,  and  persuade  the  driver  to  let  us  get  up  with 
him  to  ride  into  town.  He  was  a  good  fellow,  and 
how  we  envied  him,  and  wished  we  were  big  enough 
to  drive  stage,  as  he  sat  so  proudly  on  his  seat.  The 
driver  prepared  for  a  sensation  after  he  pulled  up  out 
of  the  river  and 'rested  his  team,  then  let  them  up 
lively  as  he  came  across  the  commons,  turned  into 
the  main  street  about 'where  Jimmie  Mount's  corner 
is,  then  dashed  up  street  and'halted  at  the  postoffice, 
delivered  the  mail  to  Major  Tate,  at  the  Recorder's 
office,  which  served  a  double"  purpose,  as  it  stood  on 


the  southeast  corner  of  the  court  house  yard,  and 
fronted  close  on  the  street.  (It  cost  25  cents  post- 
age on  a  letter  then.)  The  next  point  was  across  to 
the  old  tavern,  kept  by  Tom  Hamilton,  which  was 
burned  down  about  twenty  years  ago,  and  is  now  the 
Huston  Block. 

"  The  stage  route  passed  Cincinnati,  then  left  the 
main  road  at  the  cross  roads,  over  by  Swift's  and 
Orr's,  and  came  in  by  old  Sol  Claypool's,  then  across 
the  strip  of  woods  in  the  river  bottom  to  the  ford,  as 
stated.  The  bridge  across  the  river  beiag  built  where 
it  now  stands,  caused  the  short  route  by  Claypool's 
to  be  abandoned.  That  was  about  the  year  1839  or 
1840,  being  forty  years  ago.  Alas  I  what  changes  in 
many  ways  during  the  comparatively  short  period. 
There  was  a  woolen  factory  and  a  saw-mill  on  the 
edge  of  the  river,  east  side,  just  across  from  Andy 
Turner's  residence.  The  power  was  supplied  by  a 
mill  dam  and  feeder  race.  The  mill  burned  down, 
and  the  floods  have  removed  every  vestige  in  sight  of 
this  once  important  improvement,  and  pride  of  the 
owner,  except,  perhaps,  a  few  timbers  or  brush  wood 
that  show  where  the  dam  was  located.  The  property 
was  owned  by  Asher  Cox,  who  is  yet  alive,  and  lives 
with  his  son-in-law  near  Indianapolis.  He  can  tell 
many  incidents  in  connection  with  the  old  mill,  which 
eventually  broke  him  up  financially,  and  caused  him 
to  'go  West  and  grow  up'  again.  The  old  man  is 
remarkably  lively  and  full  of  vim;  is  rather  small  of 
stature,  quite  grey,  and  expects  to  meet  some  of  his 
old  friends  at  the  next  Fayette  County  fair. 

"  I  remember  what  a  strife  it  was  to  locate  the 
site  for  the  bridge  across  the  river.  Col.  Hankins 
and  others  wanted  it  placed  at  the  end  of  Third 
Street,  that  faces  out  from  the  Rushville  road.  Uncle 
Abe  Conwell  offered  extra  inducements  for  the  pres- 
ent location.  The  strife  was  intense  and  bitter  feel- 
ing engendered.  Silas  Woodcock,  that  good  and  ven- 
erable old  gentleman  we  all  remember  so  well,  built 
the  bridge,  which  was  a  marvel  of  immensity  to  us 
boys,  and  we  wondered  how  the  old  man  could  get  the 
timbers  so  straight,  with  his  head  to  one  side  as 
caused  by  affliction."

THE    CITY    HALL. 

In  June,  1848,  the  Commissioners  of  the  county 
granted  privilege  to  the  Trustees  of  the  town  to  erect 


146 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


on  the  west  part  of  the  public  square  a  public  build- 
ing three  stories  high,  to  be  occupied — the  first  story 
for  a  town  hall  and  engine  house;  the  second  and 
third  stories  by  any  moral  or  philanthropic  association 
of  the  city  or  county  that  are  now  or  may  be  here- 
after recognized  by  the  laws  of  tlie  State,  provided 
that  it  be  with  the  consent  of  the  President  and 
Trustees  of  the  town. 

The  building  was  erected  by  the  citizens,  the 
Society  of  Sons  of  Temperance]  and  the  Masonic 
orders  each  paying  one-third  of  the  cost.  Sherman 
Scofield  undertook  the  erection  of  the  building  for 
1-1,800.  Each  of  the  three  parties  was  to  linish  their 
respective  portions.  The  first  floor  belonged  to  the 
town,  the  second  to  the  Sons  of  Temperance,  and  the 
third  to  the  Masonic  orders. 

THE    METHODIST    EPISCOPAL     CHURCH    BUILDING     (FORMERLY 
OPERA    house). 

In  1870  the  second  and  third  floors  of  the  lai'ge 
business  building  then  belonging  to  E.  J.  Claypool, 
located  on  the  west  side  of  Central  Avenue  between 
Court  and  Fifth  Streets,  was  remodeled  and  con- 
verted into  a  neat  and  tasty  opera  house,  at  a  cost  of 
$8,000,  and  was  so  used  until  1872,  when  the  prop- 
erty was  sold  to  the  church  and  has  since  been  used 
for  religious  purposes.  The  building  as  an  ojaera 
house  was  opened  on  the  night  of  October  7,  1870, 
with  a  humorous  lecture  delivered  by  the  "  Fat  Con- 
tributor "  (A.  M.  Griswold),  of  Cincinnati. 

THE   ANDRE  OPERA  HOUSE. 

This  substantial  building  is  located  on  the  corner 
of  Fifth  and  Market  Streets  and  bears  the  name  of 
its  enterprising  builder.  The  structure  covers  ground 
48x80  feet  and  is  two  stories  high;  on  the  second 
floor  is  a  neat  opera  room  with  a  stage  21x46  feet 
and  a  seating  capacity  of  600  people.  It  is  fully 
equipped  with  beautiful  and  numerous  sets  of  scenery 
for  plays  of  all  kinds.  The  cost  of  ilie  building  com- 
plete was  $20,000.     It  was  built  in  1876. 

grave -YARDS  AND  CEMETERY. 

As  old  as  the  village  itself  was  the  first  place  of 
burial  located  on  the  river  bank  opposite  Third 
Street  and  extending  above  and  below.  This  place 
of  burial  was  not  used  much  after  1828,  the  encroach- 
ments of  the  river  making  it  necessary  to  remove  the 
graves  and  abandon  the  grounds.  The  water  now 
passes  through  what  was  once  the  city  of    the   dead. 

The  second  grave-yard  was  laid  out  on  Western 
Avenue,  nov?  the  site  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Par- 
sonage, and  was  used  until  the  growth  of  the  town 
was  such  as  to  demand  another  change,  when  the 
first  tract  of  laud  where  is  now  situated  the  beautiful 


cemetery  of  the  city  was  obtained.  This  is  located 
in  the  northwestern  outskirts  of  the  city,  comprising 
about  fourteen  acres  of  land  beautifully  laid  out  and 
dotted  over  with  choice  evergreens,  shade  trees  and 
many  elegant  and  costly  monuments  of  marble  and 
granite. 

Lucretius  says  of  the  earth: 

Omni  parens  eadem  rerum  est  Commune  aepulchrum. 
The  parent  of  all,  she  is  also  the  common  sepulchre. 

Let  our  burial  places,  therefore,  be  beautified 
with  the  "greenery  of  nature,"  and  let  the  adornments 
of  art  be  added  to  please  the  senses  and  soothe  the 
feelings  of  the  living. 

October  8, 1851,  ten  acres  of  the  cemetery  were  pur- 
chased by  the  corporation  of  Silas  Pumphrey,  Sr., 
and  laid  out  into  lots  the  following  December — it 
being  the  north  part  of  the  present  grounds.  The 
greater  number  of  the  bodies  interred  in  the  other 
yards  were  removed  to  the  cemetery.  The  latter  has 
been  under  the  care  and  management  of  the  town  and 
city  authorities  from  the  beginning.  R.  C.  Bratten, 
the  present  Superintendent,  has  held  the  position  for 
twenty  years  past. 

CONNERSVILLE    A    CITY. 

In  the  spring  of  1868  steps  were  taken  looking  to 
the  change  of  the  town  to  a  city.  A  petition  signed 
by  301  citizens  was  presented  to  the  town  authorities, 
the  population  then  being  estimated  at  2,500. 

At  an  election  held  June  16,  1869,  at  which  300 
of  the  voters  out  of  865  expressed  themselves  in  favor 
of  a  city  charter,  the  city  charter  was  procured  and 
adopted,  the  city  ordered  divided  into  three  wards, 
and  July  5  appointed  as  a  day  for  the  electiim  of  city 
officers.  The  election  resulted  in  the  choice  of  Will- 
iam H.  Beck,  Mayor;  C.  D.  Smith,  Marshal;  Henry 
F.  Kane,  Clerk;  John  Uhl,  Treasurer;  A.  H.  Wood, 
Assessor;  Council  for  the  First  Ward,  Train  Cald- 
well and  F.  Martin;  for  the  Second  Ward,  John  R. 
McCabe  and  Lee  Thalheimer;  Third  Ward,  E.  F. 
Claypool  and  John  S.  Wilson.  The  Mayors  have 
since  been  John  P.  Kerr,  elected  in  sjiring  of  1871 ; 
W.  C.  Forrey,  1872;  Gilbert  Trusler,  1876;  W.  C. 
Forrey,  1877;  Charles  Roehl,  1880;  Charles  Murray, 
1884. 

GROWTH    AND    PROGRESS. 

Important  eras  in  the  city's  history  may  be  said 
to  have  commenced  first  with  the  completion  of  the 
canal  in  1845;  second,  with  the  completion  of  the 
railroads  in  the  decade  between  1860  and  1870;  and  the 
establishment  of  the  several  large  furniture  factories 
in  the  fore  part  of  the  succeeding  decade. 

The  census  of  1830  gave  Connersville  a  population 
of  500;  the  estimated  population  in  1846  was  1,000; 
and  since  1850,  as  given  by  the  United  State  census, 


HISTOKY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

at  each  decade  it  has  been  as  follows:  1850,  1,396; 
1860,  2,119;  1870,  2,496;  1880,  3,228. 

The  postoffice  was  established  in  Connersville  in 
1818. 

The  printing  press  was  introduced  into  the  village 
in  1823. 

The  canal  was  completed  to  the  town  in  1845. 

The  electro-magnetic  telegraph  line  from  Hamil- 
ton tolndianapolis  via  Connersville  was  built  in  1851. 

The  railruad.s  came  to  the  place  in  the  decade 
between  1860  and  1870. 

The  streets  of  the  town  were  first  lighted  by  coal- 
oil  lamps  in  the  fall  of  1866. 

The  same  year  a  Board  of  Health  was  appointed, 
and  the  names  of  the  streets  changed. 

The  city  was  first  lighted  by  gas  in  1875. 

The  total  number  of  buildings  erected  in  Conners- 
ville in  1868  was  fifty-two,  costing  $150,500. 

Among  them  was  the  residence  of  B.  F.  Claypool, 
$35,000  (brick);  the  brick  business  house  of  William 
H.  Beck,  $13,000;  the  brick  business  block  of  \V.  and 
J.  Huston,  $25,000;  the  brick  business  house  of 
Alexander  Morrow,  $4,250;  the  brick  grist-mill  of  H. 
L.  Wetherald  &amp;  Son,  $13,000;  the  two-story  frame 
machine  shop  and  agricultural  implement  manufac- 
tory of  Marks  &amp;  Simpson,  $2,500;  and  seven  dwelling- 
houses  by  J.  B.  McFarland,  $12,500. 

WATER    WORKS. 

In  September,  1869,  the  Council  of  Connersville 
contracted  with  the  Holly  Manufacturing  Company 
of  Lockport,  N.  Y.,  for  the  erection  of  water  works  for 
the  city,  which  was  intended  to  furnish  a  more  effi- 
cient and  reliable  fire  protection,  rather  than  with  a 
view  of  a  revenue  therefrom  for  water  supplied  for 
domestic  purposes.  The  works  were  completed  in 
January,  1870,  at  a  cost  of  $47,000,  and  are  situated 
about  one  mile  from  the  center  of  the  city,  built  on 
ground  bought  of  Wanee  and  Martin  for  $500. 

The  machinery  of  the  Water  Works  is  propelled 
by  water  power  from  the  Connersville  Hydraulic 
(formerly  Whitewater  Valley)  Canal.  The  power  is 
80  regulated  that  a  pressure  of  from  twenty  to  twentv- 
five  pounds  is  always  kept  upon  the  mains,  which  is 
sufiicient  for  all  purj)oses  except  in  case  of  fire;  and 
in  case  of  an  alarm  of  fire  the  power  is  immediately 
increased  to  give  a  pressure  of  from  seventy-five  to 
one  hundred  pounds. 

The  works  have  remained  the  property  of  the  city, 
and  the  annual  cost  of  running  them  is  $750. 

CONNERSVILLE    GAS-LIGHT  MANUFACTURING    COMPANY. 

This  company  was  organized  in  1875,  with  a  capi- 
tal stock  of  $30,000,  officered  by  C.  B.  Newlands, 
President,  and  J.  N.  Huston,  Secretary  and  Treasurer. 


Ground  at  the  south  end  of  the  city  was  purchased  of 
the  Indiana  Furniture  Oomjjany,  and  the  present 
brick  quarters  erected.  The  works  were  completed, 
and  the  city  of  Connersville  appeared  for  the  first 
time  in  gas  light  on  Christmas  night,  1875. 

The  company  has  since  increased  its  stock  to 
$50,000.  The  present  officers  are  Levin  Mcintosh, 
President,  A.  M.  Sinks,  Secretary,  and  J.  N.  Huston, 
Treasurer. 

FIRE  DEPARTMENT. 

Until  some  time  in  the  decade  between  1830  and 
1840  the  villagers  protected  property  from  fire  as  best 
they  could  without  the  aid  of  a  fire  engine,  the  old 
bucket  line  system  being  then  in  vogue.  Toward  the 
latter  part  of  the  decade  the  first  tire  engine  of  the 
village  was  purchased  of  a  Mr.  Wadley,  of  Oxford, 
Ohio,  and  was  called  "Pluto."  The  "Pluto"  is  a 
small  engine  and  consists  of  a  rude  device  for  throw- 
ing water  placed  in  a  box  or  bed,  the  whole  being 
mounted  on  four  small  wheels.  The  water  was 
thrown  into  the  box  by  a  line  of  men  with  buckets 
extending  from  the  nearest  supply.  From  the  box 
the  water  was  pumped  by  hand  brakes  and  thrown 
upon  the  fire. 

The  second  and  last  fire  engine  introduced  into 
the  village  was  that  of  the  "Ocean,"  which  was  con- 
tracted for  June  7,  1848,  between  the  Board  of  Trust- 
ees of  Connersville  and  D.  L.  Farnham  &amp;  Co.,  of 
Cincinnati,  Ohio.  The  "Ocean"  is  what  was  known  as 
"Farnam's  Patent  Horizontal  Fire  Engine,"  having  a 
row-boat  movement,  working  horizontally  without 
levers.  It  is  a  large  two-stream  suction  engine  and 
is  worked  by  men  occupying  a  sitting  posture  as 
oarsmen  in  a  boat.  The  cost  of  it  was  $1,200.  These 
two  engines  are  still  the  property  of  the  city  authori- 
ties, though  not  in  general  use  since  1870.  On  the 
purchase  of  the  "Pluto"  and  the  "Ocean"  volunteer 
companies  were  organized  and  kept  up  dui-ing  the  use 
of  the  engines. 

On  the  adoption  of  a  city  government  in  1869 
steps  were  soon  taken  looking  to  a  better  system  of 
protecting  property  from  fire.  January  3,  1870,  an 
ordinance  to  this  end  was  established  providing  for  a 
Fire  Department  consisting  of  sixty  able-bodied  male 
citizens,  to  be  divided  into  four  divisions  of  fifteen 
members  each — three  divisions  of  hose  and  one  divis- 
ion of  hooks  and  ladders,  each  to  be  located  in  a 
suitable  place  in  the  city,  etc.,  etc.  In  accordance 
therewith  the  present  Fire  Department  was  organized 
January  19,  1870.  It  consists  of  forty-eight  men 
divided  into  four  sections,  a  division  of  twelve  men 
each — one  hook  and  ladder  division,  and  the  others, 
hose  divisions  located  as  follows:  one  hose  division 
on  Seventh  Btreet  just  west  of  the  canal;  another 
on  Eastern  Avenue,   south  of  the  railroad,   and  the 


148 


HISTORY   OF  PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


remaining  hose  division,  and  the  hook  and  ladder 
division  at  the  City  Hall  building.  There  is 
located  at  each  of  the  hose  divisions  one  hose-reel, 
and  at  the  hook  and  ladder  division  one  wagon 
with  the  necessary  equipments.  The  department 
has  about  1800  feet  of  serviceable  hose  on  the  reels 
and  about  100  feet  of  ladders  with  the  general 
accompaniments.  By  an  ordinance  established  in 
1875  each  member  of  the  department  was  to  receive 
annually  $10,  which  was  increased  by  another  ordi- 
nance established  in  1881,  to  112.50.  The  number 
composing  the  department  was  reduced  in  1881  to 
forty-eight.  Application  for  membership  is  made 
through  the  City  Council.  The  whole  department  is 
under  the  supervision  and  management  of  an  officer 
styled  the  Chief  of  Fire  Department,  whose  salary  is 
$50  per  year.  Since  the  completion  of  the  water 
works  this  system  has  been  in  successful  operation. 

BANKS. 

The  first  banking  house  established  in  Conners- 
ville  was  the  Bank  of  Connersville,  started  in  1852 
by  John  D.  Park  and  B.  F.  Sanford,  of  Cincinnati, 
with  a  capital  of  $200,000.  The  place  of  business 
was  first  in  the  rear  part  of  Mr.  Frybarger's  store 
(southwest  corner  Central  Avenue  and  Fifth  Street). 
Soon  after  the  institution  was  opened  the  proprietors 
erected  the  substantial  three-story  brick  building,  with 
stone  front,  located  on  Central  Avenue  between  Fourth 
and  Fifth  Streets,  in  which  is  now  carried  on  the 
business  of  the  Citizen's  Bank,  and  in  it  did  their 
banking  business  during  the  career  of  the  bank  which 
lasted  but  a  few  years.  Its  Presidents  were  George 
Frybarger  and  A.  B.  Conwell,  the  latter  succeeding 
Mr.  Frybarger  at  his  death  in  1853. 

Probably  one  year  after  the  organization  of  the 
Bank  of  Connersville  was  started  the  Fayette  County 
Bank,  which  was  opened  in  the  corner  room  of  what 
is  now  designated  as  the  Huston  House,  southeast 
corner  Central  Avenue  and  Fourth  Street.  Among 
the  stockholders  were'  Meredith  Helm,  Newton  Clay- 
pool,  Henry  Simpson,  L.  D.  Allen,  Henry  Goodland- 
er,  Minor  Meeker  and  Josiah  Mullikin.  Mr.  Helm 
was  the  first  President  and  Louis  D.  Allen  the  first 
Cashier  of  the  bank.  In  a  year  or  two  Louis  D. 
Allen  was  succeeded  as  Cashier  by  E.  F.  Claypool. 

The  latter  part  of  the  year  1856  the  Fayette 
County  Bank  was  merged  into  the  Connersville 
branch  of  the  Bank  of  the  State  of  Indiana,  which 
was  opened  in  the  Claypool  Building  on  the  west 
side  of  Central  Avenue  between  Court  and  Fifth 
Streets,  to  which  the  Fayette  County  Bank  had  been 
removed.  The  latter  institution  had  been  known  as 
one  of  the  most  reliable  and  safest  in  the  State.  The 
branch  of  the  State   Bank   was  opened   in   January, 


1857,  and  on  the  6th  of  that  month  John  Caldwell, 
Henry  Simpson,  Sherman  Scotield,  Amos  R.  Edwards, 
Newton  Claypool.  Thomas  J.  Crisler  and  W.  W. 
Frybarger  were  elected  Directors.  Newton  Claypool 
was  chosen  President,  E.  F.  Claypool  Cashier  andWill- 
iam  H.  Wherrett  Teller.  Some  years  afterward  the 
President  was  succeeded  by  his  sou,  B.  F.  Claypool. 
In  1857  it  was  said  that  the  stock-holders  resident  in 
the  county  owned  real  estate  in  the  coaoty  valued  at 
$340,000. 

The  Connersville  branch  of  the  State  Bank  was 
reorganized  as  the  First  National  Bank  of  Conners- 
ville in  February,  1865,  with  capital  stock  to  the 
amount  of  $100,000,  under  the  Presidency  of  B.  F. 
Clayijool,  E.  F.  Claypool  becoming  Cashier.  The 
first  Board  of  Directors  consisted  of  J.  M.  Wilson, 
H.  D.  Carlisle,  P.  H.  and  F.  M.  Roots  and  the  Pres- 
ident and  Cashier.  In  1873  P.  H.  Roots  was 
chosen  President  and  Charles  Mount  Cashier.  In 
1879  Mr.  Roots  died  and  was  succeeded  by  his 
brother,  F.  M.  Roots.  Messrs.  Roots  and  Mount  still 
retain  those  positions.  F.  T.  Roots  is  the  Vice-Presi- 
dent. From  1873  until  his  death  in  October,  1883, 
G.  W.  Dhl  was  the  Assistant  Cashier.  The  business 
of  the  bank  is  conducted  in  a  two-story  brick  building 
which  stands  on  the  northwest  corner  of  Central 
Avenue  and  Fifth  Street. 

At  the  time  Mr.  Allen  was  succeeded  as  Cashier 
of  the  Fayette  County  Bank  by  E.  F.  Claypool,  he 
withdrew  from  the  institution  and  in  September, 
1854,  opened  a  savings  bank  in  the  building  now 
occupied  by  Dr.  Vance  as  a  residence,  on  Fourth 
Street  between  Eastern  and  Central  Avenues,  which 
had  been  erected  as  a  canal  office.  Elisha  Vance  was 
chosen  President  of  this  bank,  which  was  short-lived, 
lasting  a  year  or  so  only. 

For  some  years  after  the  cessation  of  the  Bank  of 
Connersville,  in  the  same  building  was  carried  on  a 
kind  of  a  banking  business  by  James  Mount  and 
William  Merrill,  under  the  title  of  the  Farmers' 
Bank. 

In  October,  1870,  was  organized  by  James  and 
William  Huston,  Sylvester  Scofield,  Chauncy  Lyman, 
William  H.  Wherrett,  Warner  H.  Broaddus  and 
James  C.  Mcintosh,  the  Citizens'  Bank,  which  was 
opened  in  the  fine  banking  house  erected  by  the  pro 
jectors  of  the  Bank  of  Connersville,  which  building 
':  had  become  their  property.  In  1874  the  two  Hustons 
purchased  the  interest  of  Messrs.  Wherrett  and 
Scofield,  and  subsequently  (after  the  death  of  William 
Huston)  James,  his  son,  bought  out  the  remaining 
stock-holders,  and  the  institution  has  since  remained 
in  his  possession  and  under  his  management.  Since 
the  spring  of  1876  Mr.  Huston  has  been  assisted  in 
the  business  of  the  bank  by  Levin  Mclutosh. 


HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


149 


The  bank  has  a  capital  stock  of  $50,000,  with  a 
surplus  of  125,000.  It  is  one  of  the  most  reliable 
banking  houses  in  eastern  Indiana. 

INDUSTRIES. 

The  leading  industries  of  the  village  and  of  the 
later  town  have  been  referred  to  in  a  preceding  chap- 
ter, and  it  will  be  our  purpose  to  here  treat  of  the 
more  important  manufactories  beginning  with  the 
completion  of  the  canal,  which  marked  an  era  in  the 
history  of  the  town.  The  water  privileges  and 
hydraulic  power  afforded  thereby  being  of  such  a 
standard  as  to  invite  and  claim  attention,  though  tard- 
ily seized  to  any  considerable  extent,  they  have  been 
the  means  of  developing  the  slow  and  quiet  village 
and  town  of  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago  into  the  bust- 
ling manufacturing  center  of  to-day,  with  its  several 
immense  furniture  factories,  its  wonderful  rotary 
blower  foundry,  its  several  extensive  grist-mills,  its 
stocking  factory,  with  the  clusters  of  minor  mills  and 
factories  dotting  over  its  surface,  and  giving  employ- 
ment to  hundreds  of  men,  women  and  children. 

In  1846  or  thereabouts  was  built  a  large  flouring 
mill  on  the  site  of  the  present  Counersville  Hydraulic 
Mills,  located  on  the  Hydraulic  between  Sixth  and 
Seventh  Streets,  and  known  as  the  H.  L.  Wetherald 
&amp;  Son  Mill,  by  H.  C.  Moore  and  W.  P.  Lawrence, 
engineers  on  the  canal.  In  1867  the  mill  was  pur- 
chased by  H.  L.  Wetherald  &amp;  Son,  and  the  following 
year  was  destroyed  by  fire,  but  again  rebuilt  at  once. 
The  main  mill  building  is  constructed  of  brick,  and 
in  size  is  45x64  feet,  and  two  and  half  stories  high 
with  basement.  In  1883  the  mill  was  equijiped  with 
the  roller  process  system,  having  twelve  sets  of  roll- 
ers and  a  capacity  for  making  150  barrels  of  flour 
per  day.  The  firm  is  P.  B.  Wood  &amp;  E.  R.  Wether- 
ald. 

Not  far  from  the  date  of  the  building  of  the  mill 
above  described  H.  L.  Wetherald  erected  a  saw-mill 
just  east  of  the  present  site  of  the  grist-mill  of  Keller 
&amp;  Uhl  (on  the  river  near  Root's  foundry),  and  some 
later  was  erected  by  Messrs.  Wetherald  &amp;  Hughes 
the  present  large  three  and  a  half  story  frame  mill 
building  of  Keller  &amp;  Uhl.  This  passed  through 
various  hands,  and  in  1868  the  firm  of  Schlosser  &amp; 
Co.  was  succeeded  by  Keller,  Uhl  &amp;  Co. ,  and  some 
six  years  ago  the  firm  was  changed  to  its  present  title. 
The  mill  has  been  operated  with  five  run  of  stone, 
and  having  a  capacity  of  eighty  barrels  of  flour  per 
day.  It  is  now  (June,  1884,)  undergoing  a  renova- 
tion whereby  the  stones  are  to  be  replaced  by  sixteen 
double  sets  of  improved  rollers  of  the  Stephens  pat- 
ent, which  will  change  the  capacity  of  the  mill  from 
80  to  150  barrels  of  floiu-  per  day.  The  main  build- 
ing of  the  mill  is  40x60  feet. 


From  1847  to  1875  a  very  important  industry  of 
Counersville  was  the  old  Counersville  Woolen  Mill, 
which  was  located  near  the  Counersville  Hydraulic 
Mills,  and  was  established  in  1847  by  A.  &amp;  P.  H. 
Roots.  In  1852  A.  Roots,  the  senior  partner,  retired 
and  was  succeeded  by  P.  H.  &amp;  F.  M.  Roots,  who  ran 
the  business  until  1871,  when  the  name  of  the  firm 
changed  to  P.  H.  Roots  &amp;  Co.  In  March,  1875,  P.  H. 
withdrew  all  of  his  interests  as  a  partner,  making 
his  son,  Charles  P.,  principal  owner  and  business 
manager,  and  the  title  of  the  firm  became  Roots  &amp; 
Co.  The  goods  from  the  factory,  cassimeres,  jeans, 
flannels,  blankets,  robes,  hosiery,  waterproofs,  worsted 
bagging,  etc.,  etc.,  had  a  market  in  all  parts  of  the 
United  States.  The  factory  employed  on  an  average 
forty  people  the  year  round.  For  twenty-eiglit  years 
it  is  said  that  an  average  of  150,000  pounds  of  wool 
per  year  was  used  at  the  institution,  and  the  prod- 
ucts of  the  loom  during  that  period  brought  into 
Counersville  $4,500,000.  The  factory  was  destroyed 
by  fire  on  the  morning  of  June  13,  1875. 

Another  of  the  large  flouring-mills  erected  soon 
after  the  completion  of  the  canal  was  the  extensive 
mill  of  A.  B.  Conwell  on  Eastern  Avenue,  where  the 
building,  though  vacated,  still  stands  as  a  monument  to 
his  enterprise.  The  mill  most  likely  had  a  capacity 
of  manufacturing  from  150  to  200  barrels  of  flour  per 
day.  It  was  carried  on  in  the  Conwell  name  until 
its  cessation  in  1866,  when  its  water-power  was 
destroyed  by  the  great  freshet  of  that  year. 

For  a  period  of  probably  twenty-five  years  follow- 
ing the  completion  of  the  canal  pork-packing  engaged 
the  attention  of  a  number  of  the  citizens  of  Couners- 
ville and  the  county  and  several  extensive  houses  for 
the  carrying  on  of  that  industry  in  its  various 
branches  were  erected,  and  hog  slaughtering  and 
pork-packing  ranked  with  the  leading  industries. 
Among  the  large  fifms  in  operation  at  the  same  time 
during  the  period  named  were  A.  B.  Conwell  &amp; 
Sons,  George  W.  Frybarger.  Daniel  Hankins,  Hol- 
ton,  Simpson  &amp;  Co.,  Caldwell,  McCollem  &amp;  Co.,  and 
the  Fayette  County  Hog  Slaughtering  &amp;  Pork  Pack- 
ing Association,  with  their  various  changes. 

Mr.  Conwell  for  a  time  carried  on  in  the  neigh- 
borhood of  his  mill  and  tannery  and  subsequently  on 
the  site  of  the  gas  works,  and  erected  the  large  build- 
ing still  standing  on  the  northeast  corner  of  Central 
Avenue  and  Fifth  Street.  Mr.  Frybarger  built  an 
extensive  building  on  the  site  of  the  Andre  Opera 
House  and  Caldwell  Block,  and  in  these  several 
places  the  different  firms  operated. 

In  1846  there  were  6,000  hogs  packed  in  the  town; 
in  1856  about  11,000  were  slaughtered  and  packed, 
the  firms  being  A.  B.  Conwell  &amp;  Sons  and  J.  Hol- 
ton    &amp;    Co. ;     the   price   paid    was    $6  per    hundred.

HISTORY   OF   PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


In  1858  Conwell  &amp;  Sons  killed  for  Daniel  Hankins, 
and  by  all  firms  there  were  over  25,000  hogs  slaught- 
ered in  the  town;  in  1862  the  firms  of  Caldwell  &amp; 
Co.  slaughtered  upward  of  13,000  hogs  which  aver- 
aged 2-42  pounds. 

In  February,  1862,  the  Fayette  County  Hog 
Slaughtering  &amp;  Pork  Packing  Association  was  organ- 
ized with  capital  stock  of  $18,000.  Bezaled  Beeson 
was  chosen  President  and  James  Heron  Secretary  of 
the  Association.  They  purchased  the  old  Frybarger 
property,  where  the  business  of  the  Association  was 
carried  on  while  they  did  business  and  subse- 
quently by  others  engaged  in  the  business,  which 
closed  with  the  season  of  1873-74,  Caldwell  &amp;  Co. 
being  the  last  firm  engaged  in  the  business,  and  in 
1872-73  they  killed  28,000  hogs. 

The  several  largo  mills  and  pork-packing  houses 
required  thousands  of  barrels,  which  in  main  were 
manufactured  in  the  town,  adding  another  industry 
of  no  small  note. 

In  1845  Valentine  Michael  began  this  branch  of 
trade  along  the  Hydraulic  between  Fifth  and  Sixth 
Streets  and  carried  it  on  until  1864,  when  he  was 
succeeded  by  John  Uhl,  who  did  an  extensive  busi- 
ness until  1870  and  was  then  succeeded  by  the  pres- 
ent proprietor  of  the  business,  Henry  Weitsel.  Mr. 
Weitsel  now  employs  four  men.  Mr.  Uhl  while 
engaged  in  the  business  made  about  18,000  barrels 
per  year. 

In  1865  Florentine  Michael,  a  son  of  Valentine, 
began  the  same  business  and  is  yet  carrying  it  on  in  the 
southern  part  of  the  city.  He  works  seven  men  and 
manufactures  some  12,000  barrels  per  year. 

Not  a  great  deal  was  done  in  the  way  of  carriage 
manufacturing  until  about  1850,  about  which  time 
the  firm  of  Drew  &amp;  McCracken  began  the  manufac- 
ture of  buggies  and  carriages  on  Central  Avenue  near 
Sixth  Street,  but  the  shops  were  ot  short  life. 

In  1851  William  P.  &amp;  Andrew  Applegate  began 
the  same  branch  of  business  on  Central  Avenue  near 
Fifth  Street  and  the  firm  carried  on  extensively  until 
in  1870,  when  owing  to  the  death  of  William  P.,  the 
shop  was  sold  to  Hemy  &amp;  Swikley  and  they  in  a  short 
time  to  J.  B.  Mcl'arlan.  The  Applegates  worked  on 
an  average  of  from  ten  to  fifteen  hands  the  year 
through. 

About  the  time  the  Applegate  firm  commenced 
business,  a  firm  under  the  title  of  Ware  &amp;  Veatch 
opened  up  a  carriage  manufactory  on  Sixth  Street 
near  the  Hydraulic.  The  firm  lasted  several  years, 
when  Mr.  Veatch  (Charles)  became  the  proprietor, 
and  the  business  sto2:)ped  prior  to  1857. 

In  1857  J.  B.  McFarlan  established  the  extensive 
carriage  and  buggy  manufactory  now  doing  business 
under  the  name  of  the  McFarlan  Carriage  Company. 


The  old  Veatch  shop  fell  into  his  possession,  which 
was  his  place  of  beginning.  He  has  since  added 
unto  his  shops,  until  they  now  compose  quite  a  clus 
ter  of  large  buildings,  situated  on  either  side  of 
Sixth  Street  just  west  of  Central  Avenue,  on  which 
is  also  a  portion  of  the  woi-ks.  The  company,  com- 
prising J.  B.,  C.  E.,  J.,  W.  W.  and  J.  E.  McFarlan 
was  formed  in  1883.  They  manufacture  carriages 
and  buggies,  and  employ  seventy  five  men  the  year 
round,  turning  out  hundreds  of  vehicles. 

In  1884  was  organized  the  Connersville  Buggy 
Company  (successors'  to  Batavia  Buckboard  Com- 
pany), and  located  in  the  large  mill  building  on  the 
corner  of  Eastern  Avenue  and  Charles  Street,  for- 
merly occupied  as  a  planing-mill.  The  building  is 
large  and  commodious,  and  the  company  works  from 
forty  to  fifty  hands,  and  will  likely  make  during  the 
coming  year  1,500  vehicles.  The  officers  of  the  com- 
pany are  J.  N.  Huston,  President;  J.  D.  Larned, 
Treasiirer;  L.  T.  Bower,  Secretary,  and  John  W. 
Pohlmaa,  Superintendent  of  Manufactures. 

The  tanning  business  has  been  carried  on  in  Con- 
nersville from  the  very  beginning  of  the  village. 
Besides  the  old  Rees,  Conwell  and  others  elsewhere 
referred  to,  the  business  was  carried  on  where  the 
hominy  mill  now  is,  and  in  that  vicinity  for  many 
years.  Forty  odd  years  ago  Brown  &amp;  Bundrant  were 
tanners  there.  The  yard  tiually  passed  into  the  pos- 
session of  John  L.  Gilchrist,  and  has  only  recently 
ceased.  A  year  or  so  ago,  in  that  neighborhood,  the 
Myer  Bros,  began  the  business,  and  are  now  car- 
rying on  in  that  line  on  a  small  scale. 

About  the  year  1846  William  F.  (iephart,  of 
Dayton,  Ohio,  erected  a  portion  of  the  Root's  foun- 
dry building,  and  in  it  started  a  stove  foundry,  and 
after  operating  several  years  in  one  end  of  the  build- 
ing, John  Ensley,  of  Richmond,  began  the  manu- 
facture of  machinery,  threshing-machines,  steam- 
engines,  etc.  Mr.  Gephart  sold  to  William  J.  Han- 
kins. 

In  about  1855  Mr.  Ensley,  in  connection  with 
James  Mount  and  Josiah  Mullikin,  erected  the  large 
brick  building  on  Eastern  Avenue  near  the  Cinoiu- 
nati,  Hamilton  &amp;  Indianapolis  Railroad,  at  a  cost  of 
14,000,  and  in  it  carried  on  the  manufacture  of  vari- 
ous kinds  of  machinery,  threshing-machines,  engines, 
sorgham-mills,  etc..  etc.  Mr.  Ensley  soon  went  out, 
and  the  firm  became  Erwin,  Mount  &amp;  Mullikin,  and 
under  that  title  the  business  there  ceased,  and  the 
building  was  sold  in  1866  to  Wetherald  &amp;  Sons. 
Previous  to  the  selling  of  the  building  Mr.  Mullikin 
had  I'ented  the  old  foundry  building  of  Mr.  Hankins, 
and  in  it  carried  on  the  same  business  as  the  firm  of 
Erwin,  Mount  &amp;  Mullikin  had  been  engaged  in,  he 
having  the  entire  building,  Hankius  having  gone  out.

The  successors  to  Mr.  Mullikin  were  E.  &amp;  E.  L.  Mul- 
likin,  who  continued  the  business  until  in  1863, 
when  it  was  discontinued. 

In  January,  1864  the  foundry  building  was  sold 
to  Messrs.  P.  H.  &amp;.  F.  M.  Roots,  who  then  began  the 
manufacture  of  a  i-otary  force  blast  blower  at  Con- 
nersville,  and  in  connection  with  the  foundry  carried 
on  a  machine  shop.  The  blower  was  of  their  own 
invention,  which  was  developed  about  1860,  and 
until  1864  manufactured  at  other  machine  shops. 
From  1860  to  1870  their  patents  were  covered  by  fif- 
teen different  issues. 

Since  the  death  of  Mr.  P.  H.  Roots  the  Foundry 
has  been  carried  on  by  the  other  brother  and  in  the 
Roots  name.  It  now  comprises  throe  buildings,  one 
of  which  is  three  stories  high,  and  the  others  two 
stories  each — dimensions  75x40  feet,  70x30  feet  and 
60x40  feet,  all  well  equipped  with  improved  machin- 
ery. The  works  are  located  in  the  south  end  of  the 
city  near  the  river.  Some  seventy-five  men  are  con- 
stantly employed.  Since  the  beginning  there  have 
been  manufactured  at  this  foundry  and  sold  in  this 
country  over  10,000  blowers,  and  as  many  more  in 
foreign  countries,  5,000  of  which  are  now  in  use  in 
England.  The  blower  has  been  awarded  first  medals 
and  premiums  at  the  Paris  Exposition  in  1867;  Vienna 
Exposition  in  1873,  and  at  the  Centennial  Exposi- 
tion in  1876.  At  the  foundry  are  now  manufactured 
force  blast  blowers,  portable  forges  and  gas  ex- 
hausters. 

The  beginning  of  the  manufacture  of  furniture  in 
Connersville,  which  has  resulted  in  the  four  large 
factories  now  in  the  city,  dates  back  to  the  year 
1865.  In  May  of  this  year  A.  C.  Cooley,  a  cabinet- 
maker and  furniture  dealer,  and  Warren  Wanee,  a 
carpenter,  united  their  business  and  began  the  manu- 
facture of  furniture  in  the  old  factory  building  still 
standing  near  the  Water  Works.  In  the  October 
following  they  dissolved.  A  month  later  a  company 
composed  of  A.  C.  Cooley,  George  W.  Gregg  and 
William  Newkirk,  for  the  manufacture  of  furniture, 
was  formed,  and  occupied  the  factory  building,  here- 
tofore referred  to,  by  the  Water  Works,  continuing 
together  until  in  1869  (manufacturing  and  carry- 
ing on  retail  business  down  town),  when  they  dis- 
solved, Mr.  Newkirk  possessed  of  the  factory  build- 
ing and  machinery,  and  Cooley  &amp;  Gregg  the 
retail  property.  Probably  six  months  later  Gregg 
sold  his  interest  to  Alexander  Morrison,  and  in  1S70 
Cooley,  Morrison  &amp;  Co.  began  operations  as  a  fur- 
niture manufacturing  company  in  the  old  foundry 
building  on  Eastern  Avenue.  They  continued  there 
until  July  of  the  same  year,  when  they  removed  to 
a  shop  on  Central  Avenue,  previously  occupied  by 
Messrs.  Wanee  &amp;  Martin  as  a  carpenter   shop,  and 


there  continued  their  business   until  in  1874,  when 
it  was  merged  into  a  stock  company. 

The  factory  of  the  Cooley-Morrison  Furniture 
Manufacturing  Association  is  on  the  corner  of  Seventh 
and  Mason  Streets,  the  main  building  being  a  sub- 
stantial brick  four  stories  high,  and  in  size  is  40x120 
feet.  The  President  of  the  Association  is  Curtis 
Wright,  and  T.  J.  Rittenhouse  Secretary  and  Treas- 
urer. They  employ  100  hands  and  manufacture 
walnut  and  ash  bureaus,  dressers,  wash-stands,  bed- 
steads, and  dress  case  and  bureau  suits. 

At  the  time  Mr.  Newkirk  came  into  possession 
of  the  old  factory  he  associated  with  him  Herman 
Munk  in  the  manufacture  of  furniture,  and  in  1874 
Newkirk  sold  out  to  James  E.  Roberts,  and  the  firm 
became  Munk  &amp;  Roberts,  and  in  1884  the  present 
company  styled  "Munk  &amp;  Roberts  Furniture  Co.," 
manufacturers  of  suits,  bureaus,  and  wash-stands. 
The  factory  is  located  in  the  northwestern  out-skirts 
of  the  city  along  the  track  of  the  Whitewater  Valley 
Railroad.  They  have  two  large  substantial  brick 
buildings,  one  of  which  is  four  stories  high,  and  in 
size  60x100  feet,  built  in  1878,  and  the  other,  erected 
in  1883,  is  five  stories  high  and  is  50x140  feet.  One 
hundred  and  fifty  workmen  are  employed  on  an  aver- 
age. President,  H.  Munk;  Secretary  and  Treasurer, 
J.  E.  Roberts. 

Mr.  Newkirk,  on  selling  his  interests  to  James  E. 
Roberts  in  1874,  formed  the  Indiana  Furniture  Com- 
pany, with  the  following  named  incorporators :  Will- 
iam Newkirk,  J.  B.  McFarlan,  John  W.  Ross,  J.  M. 
Wilson,  B.  F.  Claypool,  G.  C.  and  F.  A.  Hanson. 
The  company  was  organized  in  September,  1874,  with 
a  capital  stock  of  $50,000.  The  officers  were  W. 
Newkirk,  President;  W.  H.  Wherrett,  Secretary  and 
Treasurer.  The  capital  stock  has  been  twice  increased, 
and  is  now  $100,000.  The  factory  is  located  at  the 
south  end  of  Eastern  Avenue.  The  original  building 
was  constructed  in  1874,  being  five  stories  high,  and 
a  second  building  was  erected  in  1876.  It  is  four 
stories  high,  and  each  are  120x40  feet.  An  additional 
building  was  erected  in  1878.  The  company  employs 
160  men,  and  probably  on  an  average  manufacture 
120,000  pieces  per  year.  The  articles  manufactured 
are  confined  exclusively  to  ash,  walnut  and  cherry 
sets.  Present  officers:  William  Newkirk,  President; 
George  M.  Sinks,  Secretary  and  Treasurer. 

The  Connersville  Furniture  Manufactui'ing  Com- 
pany was  organized  as  a  joint  stock  company  in  Feb- 
ruary, 1882,  with  the  following  officers,  who  still 
retain  their  positions:  F.  M.  Roots,  President; 
Charles  Mount,  Vice-President;  N.  W.  Wright,  Sec- 
retary; E.  B.  Hawkins,  Superintendent  factory. 

The  factory  is  located  nearly  opposite  to  that  of 
Munk  &amp;  Roberts,  and  the  main  building  is  of    brick,

six  stories  high,  and  in  size  50x150  feet.  They  man- 
ufacture walnut  and  other  hard  wood  furniture,  mak- 
ing a  specialty  of  bed  room  suits.  They  employ  on 
an  average  150  workmen. 

On  Sunday  morning,  January  26,  1884,  a  fire 
occurred  at  the  factory,  by  which  it  was  damaged,  as 
adjusted  by  the  several  insurance  companies,  to  the 
extent  of  $14,500. 

What  was  known  as  the  coffin  factory,  located 
where  the  Connersville  Furniture  Company  are  now 
doing  business,  originated  with  John  Wanee,  who 
along  toward  the  latter  part  of  the  decade  between 
1860  and  1870  began  the  manufacture  of  a  few  cof- 
fins, in  connection  with  other  business.  Subsequently 
he  associated  with  him  in  the  enterprise  T.  J.  Parry. 
In  October,  1874,  J.  H.  Bailey  and  Samuel  Beck 
boaght  an  interest  in  the  business,  and  in  January, 
1875,  the  partnership  closed,  and  a  stock  company 
was  formed  with  a  capital  of  $57,000.  The  factory 
comprised  several  buildings,  one  of  which  was  erected 
in  1869  by  Martin  &amp;  Wauee,  and  the  other,  a  five- 
story  brick,  80x40  feet,  in  1874,  at  a  cost  of  $13,700. 
In  May,  1879,  the  factory  was  destroyed  by  fire,  when 
seventy -five  men  and  boys  and  fifteen  girls  were 
thrown  out  of  employment.  The  stock  at  the  time  of 
the  fire  comprised  7,000  coffins,  5,000  of  which  were 
ready  for  shipment.  The  loss  sustained  was  estimated 
at  from  $60,000  to  $70,000. 

The  Western  Hosiery  Mills  are  located  at  the 
south  end  of  Central  Avenue.  Their  building  is  a 
three-story  brick  85x35  feet,  erected  in  1884.  The 
business  was  established  in  1873  by  Leonard  Bros., 
with  W.  H.  Caswell  as  Superintendent.  But 
one  or  two  machines  were  used  in  the  beginning, 
which  were  operated  at  the  house  of  the  Superin- 
tendent. Their  various  places  of  business  in  the 
past  have  been  on  the  Buckley  corner,  over  the 
Frybarger  store  and  in  the  building  adjoining  the 
Gentry  Livery  Stable  on  Central  Avenue.  The  num- 
ber of  machines  used  has  increased  from  two  to  one 
hundred,  the  number  now  in  use.  In  1881  the  Su- 
perintendent obtained  a  patent  for  driving  knitting  and 
other  light  machinery  by  power,  and  applied  it  to  the 
Lamb  machines  then  in  use  by  Leonard  Bros.,  who 
transferred  the  right  to  Chenoweth  &amp;  Kalph  when 
they  purchased  the  mill,  and  the  present  company 
secured  it  at  the  time  of  the  purchase  from  Cheno- 
weth &amp;  Ralph.  From  June,  1882,  until  October, 
1883,  the  firm  was  Chenoweth  &amp;  Ralph,  at  which 
latter  date  Mr.  Ralph  purchased  the  interest  of 
his  partner,  and  a  joint  stock  company  was  or- 
ganized with  J.  N.  Huston  as  President;  Melvin 
Ellis,  Secretary;  A.  J.  Ralph,  Manager,  and  W. 
H.  Caswell,  Superintendent.  In  May,  1884,  Mr. 
Ralph  sold  his  interest  to  Hub  Thomas  and  retired 


from  the  mill.  One  hundred  female  operatives  are 
employed  at  the  factory,  where  a  general  line  of 
seamless  and  cut  hosiery,  mittens,  etc.,  are  manufact- 
ured. 

In  1875  was  started,  in  part  of  the  old  Frybarger 
pork  house,  a  sash,  door  and  blind  factory,  by  D.  W. 
Andre  and  J.  H.  Stewart  &amp;  Co.  This  finally  became 
the  factory  of  Downs,  Ready  &amp;  Co.,  contractors  and 
builders,  and  manufacturers  of  sash,  doors,  blinds, 
moldings,  etc.  The  firm  employ  from  fifty  to  sixty 
Lands. 

The  Connersville  Pearl  Hominy  Company  was 
established  in  1882  by  C.  Ross,  Val  and  J.  S.  Leon- 
ard and  N.  J.  Morrison.  In  May,  1884,  Mr.  Ross 
was  succeeded  by  W.  H.  Wherrett,  who  is  now  Presi- 
dent of  the  company,  and  Val  Leonard  Secretary  and 
Treasurer.  The  mill  is  located  in  the  southern  part 
of  the  city  along  the  Hydraulic;  its  average  dimen- 
sions 150x40,  three  stories  high,  and  is  fully 
equipped  with  improved  machinery  for  the  manufact- 
ure of  the  new  patent  process  of  kiln  dried  hominy, 
grits,  corn  flour,  cream  meal,  pearl  meal,  etc. 

In  1877  was  erected  just  north  of  the  Cincinnati, 
Hamilton  &amp;  Indianapolis  Railroad  a  steam  saw-mill 
by  L.  T.  Bower  and  H.  C.  Eliason.  The  two  operated 
it  for  a  couple  of  years,  when  Mr.  Eliason  became 
the  sole  proprietor  and  is  now  carrying  on  the  busi- 
ness. 

Three  or  four  years  ago  Messrs.  Bower  &amp;  Tat- 
man  erected  the  large  frame  building  in  which  is  now 
carried  on  the  business  of  the  Connersville  Buggy 
Company,  and  in  it  started  a  planing-mill,  sash,  door 
and  blind  factory.  This  was  only  operated  two  or 
three  years. 

SCHOOLS. 

Of  the  early  schools  of  Connersville  there  is  no 
record.  We  are  reliably  informed,  however,  that  the 
County  Seminary  building  was  the  first  house  espec- 
ially erected  for  school  purposes;  in  other  words,  it 
was  the  first  regular  schoolhouso  in  the  village.  Prior 
to  this  period  (1828-29)  schools  were  taught  where- 
ever  and  whenever  it  was  most  convenient  to  find 
teachers  and  quarters  for  the  scholars.  Among  these 
can  be  mentioned  a  school  taught  by  Charles  Don- 
ovan in  a  hewod-log-cabin,  that  stood  on  the  south 
side  of  the  alley,  on  the  east  side  of  old  Main  Street, 
on  the  site  of  the  Dickson  dwelling.  This  was  not 
far  from  1823-24.  Subaoqueutly  the  same  man 
taught  in  a  log  building  on  the  east  side  of  what  is 
now  called  Central  Avenue,  just  south  of  Third 
Street.  A  school  is  remembered  as  having  been  held 
in  a  dwelling  on  Central  Avenue,  near  the  old  Archi- 
bald Reed  tavern.  A  Mr.  Gilbert  and  a  man  by  the 
name  of  Gray  taught  in  Connersville  prior  to  the 
building  of  the  seminary. 


HISTOKY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

The  County  Seminary  was  established   under  an 
act  of  January  27,  1827.      The  lirst  Board  of  Trust- 
ees were  George  Frybarger,  Dr.  Philip  Mason  and 
James    Qroendyke,    of    which   Martin   M.    Ray  was 
appointed  Clerk.      The  ground   selected   for  its  site 
was  designated  as  Lots  Nos.  1  and  2  on  the  original 
town  plat,  which  was  then  owned  by  Oliver  H.  Smith. 
The  sum  of    $510.50,  was   donated   for  the  erection 
of  a  building;  the  contract  for  the  brick,  mason  and  car- 
penter work  was  let  to  Richard^  Miller  for  $773,  and 
was  to  be  completed  by  January  1,  1829.      It  was  to 
be  a  brick  structure,  two  stories  high,  with  a  pedi- 
ment and  belfry.     Samuel  C,  Sample  was  appointed 
to  superintend  its  erection.     Thomas   Alexander  was 
employed  to  lath  and    plaster    the    liouso    for    $50. 
Thomas  J.    Sample  and   William  Burnett  were  em- 
ployed to  make  the  desks,  seats   and  otherwise  fur- 
nish the  house  for  $45,    and    William  McOleary  and 
Julius   Whitmore  to  paint  the  house  at  $1.12  J  per 
day  (they  furnishing  the  brushes).      The  building  was 
completed,  and  school   opened   in   it  by  Samuel  W. 
Parker,    Monday,   July  13,  1829.      Caleb  B.  Smith, 
who  succeeded   Mr.  Ray  as  Clerk,  gave  notice   "that 
the    establishment  of    a  seminary    has   been   at    the 
expense  of  the  county,  and  the   object  of   the  man- 
agers is  to  afford  to  the  youth  of  the  county  an  oppor- 
tunity of  acquiring  a  good  academic  education." 

The  year  was  divided  into  four  terms.  There  was 
an  elementary  school;  and  English  scientific  course 
the  latter  being  divided  into  two  classes,  namely  ju' 
nior  and  senior.  In  the  elementary  school  were  taught 
orthography,  reading,  'penmanship  and  arithmetic 
(Pike's  system)  through  the  Rule  of  Practice.  In  the 
junior  year  arithmetic  was  completed,  English 
grammar  (Greenleaf),  ancient  and  modern  geogra- 
phy (Worcester),  book-keeping  through  single  .entry, 
elements  of  history  with  historical  charts  (J.  E. 
Worcester),  weekly  recitations  in  declamation  and 
composition.  The  senior  class  comprised  rhetoric 
(Jameson),  logic  (Hodge's),  natural  philosophy  and 
chemistry  (Keating),  algebra  (Bounycastle),  geome- 
try (Playfair's),  surveying  (Gummerie's),  mensuration 
(Bonnycastle). 

Latin,  Greek  and  French  were  to  be  taught  with 
higher  mathematics  if  applied  for.  Students  that 
completed  course  were  entitled  to  diplomas,  and 
those  completing  it  in  part  to  certiticates  of  prog, 
ress.  The  tuition  was  $2,  $3  and  $5_ respectively  for 
departments  named. 

Subsequent  early  teachers  in  the  seminary  were 
Elder  M.  Bradley,  a  graduate  of  Brown  University, 
R.  I ,  and  Harvey  Nutting,  the  latter  having  taught 
for  a  long  period  in  the  various  schools  of  the  county. 
The  number  of  pupils  in  attendance  in  the  seminary 
in  the  fall  of  133U  was  100.     Under  date  of  August 


10, 1832,  it  was  stated  in  print,  "The  citizens  of  Con- 
neraville  and  Fayette  County,  generally,  are  respect- 
fully informed  that  Mr.  Harvey  Nutting,  recently 
from  Boston,  will  open  a  school  in  their  seminary, 
on  Monday  the  13th  of  August.  *  *  *  ]vir. 
Nutting  is  a  stranger  among  us;  but  from  what  we 
have  seen  of  his  deportment  and  ascertained  in  rela- 
tion to  his  qualifications  as  a  teacher,  we  are  disposed 
to  recommend  him  to  the  favorable  regard  of  our  fel- 
low citizens." 

On  Christmas  Day,  1833,  a  subscription  paper 
was  circulated  for  the  purpose  of  raising  means  to 
purchase  a  bell  to  be  hung  in  the  cupola  of  the 
building.  The  names  of  the  subscribers  are  set  forth

The  bell  weighed  seventy-five  and  a  half  pounds,

For   several    years,   beginning   with    1830,    Mrs. 
Haynes  taught  what  she  termed  a  female  academy  - 
in  the  village. 

In  the  absence  of  records  we  can  only  give  a 
meager  account  of  the  schools  of  the  village  for  some 
years  prior  to  1853.  Among  the  early  teachers  oth- 
er than  those  given:  J.  G.  Edgerton.  J.  B.  Tate,  Mrs. 
Qinn,  Harriet  Mcintosh  and  Revs.  Nelson  and 
Jenkins. 

The  basement  of  the  old  Methodist  Church  (now 
German  Presbyterian)  was  used  for  school  purposes. 
Up  to  probably  1840  the  Trustees  furnished  the  house 
and  teachers  generally  fixed  their  own  tuition.  For 
the  next  decade  or  more  there  was  not  much  free 
school,  but  considerable  pay  school. 

In  1843  it  appears  from  an  article  of  agreement 
before  us  that  Connersville  was  styled  District  No.  7, 
Town  14,  Range  12,  of  which  the  School  Trustees 
were  Josiah  MuUikin  and  Richard  Winchel.  They 
employed  John  B.  Tate  to  teach  the  common  branches 
in  Connersville  for  six  months,  beginning  May  17,  in 
consideration  for  which  Mr.  Tate  was  to  receive  $22 
per  month. 

In  1853  the  School  Board  consisted  of  Messrs. 
Hagerman,  Crawford  and  Applegate,  and  in  Septem-

HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


ber  of  thatjyear  the  following  was  adopted:  Whereas, 
the  graded  free  school  presents  advantages  not  to  be 
found  in  the  older  systems,  it  is  desirable  to  have 
introduced  into  the  corporation  schools  as  soon  as 
possible,  bat  in  view  of  the  expense  involved  in  pay- 
ing for  tuition  and  other  contingences  which  would 
follow  on  the  adoption  of  said  system  in  all  its  pro- 
visions, and  in  the  further  consideration  that  all  the 
means  to  be  used  in  buying  grounds  and  building 
schoolhouses  are  yet  to  be  provided,  it  is  thought 
advisable  to  introduce  a  plan.  The  corporation  School 
Trustees  shall  furnish  school-rooms,  including  furni- 
ture together  with  fuel  to  warm  the  same,  on  condi- 
tion, first,  the  Trustee  must  have  satisfactory  assur- 
ance that  proper  inducement  will  be  presented  to 
secure  as  many  pupils  as  may  be  thought  advisable. 
Second,  that  proper  efforts  will  be  made  to  introduce 
and  carry  out  the  plan  in  compliance  with  such  rules 
and  regulations  as  may  be  prescribed  by  the  person 
or  persons  whose  duty  it  may  be  to  direct  and  control 
the  same.  All  teachers  engaging  under  this  manage- 
ment will  fix  their  own  price  of  tuition,  and  make 
their  own  collections.  Be  it  further  resolved  that  to 
execute  the  above  plan  the  corporation  School  Trus- 
tees shall  appoint  an  Educational  Committee  to  ba 
composed  of  two  branches,  first,  an  executive  branch 
to  consist  of  three  members,  whose  duty  it  shall  be 
to  prepare  all  the  rules  and  regulations  necessary  in 
carrying  out  said  system,  viz.,  to  receive  the  applica- 
tion of  teachers,  and  to  make  all  proper  arrangements 
to  enable  them  (the  teachers)  to  enter  upon  the  dis- 
charge of  their  duties,  to  arrange  the  division  of  the 
grades,  to  select  a  series  of  text-books,  and,  in  short, 
attend  to  all  such  duties  as  devolve  upon  the  general 
Superintendent  of  the  district  school.  They  will 
apply  to  the  corporation  School  Board  for  the 
school  room,  when  wanted,  and  for  any  repairs 
or  material  of  any  kind  which  may  be  required. 
Second,  an  auxiliary  branch  to  be  composed  of  three 
members  from  each  of  the  three  school  districts,  whose 
duty  it  shall  be  to  assist  the  teachers  in  making  up 
their  schools,  and  also  to  confer  with  the  citizens 
generally  on  the  subject  of  the  above  management, 
giving  all  the  information  necessary  to  encourage  and 
promote  the  desired  success. 

The  Executive  Committee  consisted  of  Kevs.  J.  B. 
Brownlee,  E.  G.  Wood  and  William  Pelan.  The 
auxiliary, Committee  was,  in  First  District,  Joseph  Jus- 
tice, James  Miller  and  James  Mount;  in  Second  Dis- 
trict, William  Hawk,  N.  H.  Burk  and  Alexander 
Morrison;  in  Third  District  William  Brown,  William 
Tindall  and  John  Farner. 

A  suitable  building  could  not  be  procured  and  the 
Trustees  determined  to  abandon  the  hope  of  opening 
school  for  the  present.     Subsequently  a  School  Board 


consisting  of  N.  K  Burk,  J.  Justice  and  E.  B.  Thomas 
was  elected  by  the  people  and  remained  in  office  until 
after  the  erection  of  the  present  school  building. 

The  teachers  in  1854  were  Elenor  Jones,  Catha- 
rine Farmer,  Harriet  Mcintosh,  John  W.  McLain, 
Euphemia  Mullikin,  L.  J.  Beach,  H.  R.  Grosvenor, 
Hannah  Ginn  and  O.  Aborn.  The  enumeration  of 
scholars  for  the  year  was  612;  whole  number  en- 
rolled during  the  year,  429;  average  daily  attend- 
ance, 249.  The  male  teachers  received  $36  per  month, 
and  the  females  |20.  The  common  branches  and 
astronomy  were  taught. 

In  September,  1855,  the  County  Commissioners 
leased  the  lot  on  which  the  seminary  stood  for  a  period 
of  ninet^'-nine  years  to' the  School  Trustees,  and  at  once 
steps  were  taken  for  the  erection  of  a  school  building 
thereon.  In  December  of  that  year  A.  Hatton  sub- 
mitted the  following  plan  for  building:  Dimensions, 
86  feet  front  by  69 J  feet  deep;  three  stories  high; 
four  rooms,  35x30  in  each  story,  with  halls  12  feet 
wide,  extending  through  the  entire  breadth  of  the 
house.  The  building  was  to  be  built  in  the  following 
spring,  the  contractor  being  Sherman  Scotield.  It 
was  not  completed  and  ready  for  occupancy,  we  un- 
derstand, until  1858. 

From  1858  to  1860  John  Brady  was  the  Superin- 
tendent, being  the  first  to  fill  that  office  of  the  Con- 
nersville  schools.  From  1860  to  1865  there  is  a  miss- 
ing link  in  the/ecords.  In  the  latter  year  Charles 
Roehl  was  elected  Superintendent,  and  served  in  that 
capacity  for  two  years.  (During  this  time  the  term 
of  free  schools  was  six  months,  and  the  remainder  of 
the  school  year  was  taught  a  pay  school.)  From  1867 
to  1871  J.  L.  Rippetoe  served  in  the  capacity  of 
Superintendent,  the  first  year  of  which  period  con- 
sisted of  eight  months  (the  greatest  length  of  any  year 
since  the  establishment  of  the  institution)  Pay  school 
pieced  out  the  year.  During  the  four  years  of  Prof.  • 
Rippetoe's  management,  considerable  change  was 
made  in  the  manner  of  instructing.  In  1871  a  Mr. 
Hughes  was  chosen  Superintendent,  and  remained  as 
such  one  yeai",  when  succeeded  by  a  Mr.  Housekeeper, 
who  was  compelled  to  resign  on  account  of  poor 
health,  just  before  the  close  of  the  school  year.  In 
1873  J.  L.  Rippetoe,  the  present  worthy  Superin- 
tendent, again  assumed  the  management  of  the 
schools,  which  position  he  has  since  continuously 
filled.  The  length  of  the  school  year  since  1868  has 
been  nine  months. 

The  first  commencement  exercises  of  the  school 
were  held  June  14  1878,  when  a  class  of  seven  were 
graduated  from  the  institution,  Charles  Koehl,  then 
President  of  the  School  Board,  presenting  the  diplo- 
mas. 

In  this  connection  it  is  but  proper  to  refer  briefly 


HISTORY  OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY.

to  the  late  Harvey  Nutting,  who  for  a  long  period  of 
years  was  at  the  head  of  educational  matters  in  the 
county,  and  for  more  than  a  dozen  years  was  the 
pioneer  of  higher  education  in  Connersville.  "Uncle 
Harvey, "  as  he  was  called,  was  a  native  of  Massa- 
chusetts, born  in  1808.  He  received  a  classical  edu- 
cation at  Amherst  College,  and  in  1832  located  in 
Connersville,  where  he  resided  the  greater  part  of  the 
time  until  his  death,  which  occurred  September  7, 
1884. 

CHURCHES. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  Church. — It  is  said  that 
the  first  Methodist  class  In  Connersville  met  and  was 
formed  at  the  residence  of  Robert  Swift  and  that  Mr. 
Swift  was  appointed  the  Leader.  (Mr.  Swift  settled 
at  Connersville  in  1818). 

In  1821  a  circuit  was  formed  by  Rev.  John  Hav- 
ens, a  local  preacher,  which  included  the  village  of 
Connersville  and  was  styled  the  Connersville^Circuit, 
and  came  in  the  Conference  the  following  year.  This 
was  under  the  Presiding  Eldership  of  Rev.  Alexander 
Cummins.  Rev.  James  Murray  was  appointed  to  the 
circuit  in  1822  and  in  1823  Rev.  Aaron  Wood,  who 
remarks  that  "when  I  went  to  Connersville  in  Sep- 
tember, 1823,  there  was  a  society  of  eight  women  and 
two  men  in  town — Robert  Swift  and  Thomas  Rutter 
— until  Joshua  Mcintosh  moved  there  from  Dayton, 
Ohio."     (This  was  in  1824.) 

In  1825  the  site  of  the  present  church  building 
in  which  services  are  held  by  the  German  Presbyter- 
ian congregation,  on  the  south  side  of  Fourth  Street 
between  Water  Street  and  Eastern  Avenue,  was  pur- 
chased from  John  McCormack,  Sr.  The  deed  of 
conveyance  bears  the  date  of  November  8,  1825.  The 
Trustees  to  whom  the  deed  was  made  were  Joshua 
Mcintosh,  Thomas  Hinkson,  David  Melton,  Isaac 
Wood  and  Charles  Donivan.  During  the  following 
summer  a  brick  building  22x32  feet  was  erected 
which  was  the  first  building  dedicated  to  God  as  a 
place  of  public  worship  in  the  city.  This  building 
was  used  until  1840,  when  it  was  removed  and  the 
present  brick  edifice  now  standing  on  the  same  site 
erected.  This  church  edifice  served  the  Methodist 
congregation  as  a  place  of  worship  until  the  year 
1872,  when  it  was  sold  to  the  German  Presbyterian 
congregation.  The  Methodists  then  worshiped  in  the 
court  house  until  in  January,  1873,  when  they  came 
in  possession  of  the  Grand  Opera  House  of  the  city, 
which  they  had  purchased  in  December,  1872,  at  a 
cost  of  $16,500. 

In  the  fall  of  1848  the  church  in  Connersville 
was  divided,  and  two  societies  formed,  one  remaining 
in  the  old  church  and  the  other  located  on  Western 
Avenue.  The  western  society  built  a  house  of  wor- 
ship on    Western   Avenue,   which    was    subsequently 


converted  into  a  parsonage,  and  which  continues  to 
be  occupied  as  such.  The  two  Connersville  societies 
became  the  heads  of  two  circuits  known  as  the  East 
aad  West  Connersville  Circuits. 

In  1850-51  the  two  societies  in  Connersville  were 
made  into  stations,  and  continued  as  such  for  three 
years.     The  pastors    in  the  Western  charge  were,  in 

1851,  F.  W.  White;  1852,  Jacob  Whiteman;  1853,  E. 
D.Long.    In  the  Eastern  charge,  1851,  J.  B.  Lathrop; 

1852,  Lewis  Dale;  1853,  Joseph  Colton.  In  1853 
S.  T.  Gillett  succeeded  to  the  Presiding  Eldership  on 
the  district.  The  preachers  and  the  Presiding -El- 
ders were  clearly  of  the  opinion  that  the  two  charges 
should  be  consolidated  into  one  and  under  their  judi- 
cious management  the  consolidation  was  effected  and 
the  union  was  ratified  by  the  Bishop  of  the  next  ses- 
sion of  the  annual  Conference,  and  John  W.  Sullivan 
made  the  station  preacher. 

The  following  list  contains  the  names  of  the  pas- 
tors from  that  period,  they  coming  in  the  fall  of  the 
year  indicated: 

1855,  S.  P.  Crawford;  1856-57,  E.  G.  Tucker; 
1858-59,  J.  G.  Chafee;  1860-61,  C.  Tinsley;  1862- 
63,  J.  Cotton;  1864,  J.  B.  Lathrop;  1865-66,  R.  M. 
Barnes;  1867-68-69,  J.  S.  Tevis;  1870-71-72,  G. 
L.  Curtis;  1873-74-75,  J.  K.  Pye;  1876-77-78,  J. 
G.  Chafee;  1879,  E.  L.  Dolph;  1880-81,  F.  C.  Hol- 
liday;  1882-83,  J.  S.  Tevis,  the  present  incum- 
bent. 

The  Fifteenth  Session  of  the  Indiana  Conference 
was  held  in  Connersville  in  1846,  and  the  Sixteenth 
Session  of  the  Southeastern  Indiana  Conference  was 
held  here  in  1867. 

The  Presbyterian  Church. — In  the  year  1824 
the  Cincinnati  Presbytery  of  the  Old  School 
branch  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  sent  Rev. 
Daniel  Hayden^  to  Connersville  to  preach,  and,  if 
practicable,  to  organize  a  church  according  to  their 
confession  of  faith.  Mr.  Hayden  arrived  in  the  vil- 
lage on  Saturday,  October  2,  preached  in  the  court 
liouse  the  next  day,  and  on  Monday,  the  4th,  organ- 
ized a  church.  A.  Van  Vleet,  Adam  Smeltser,  and 
John  Boyd  were  elected  Ruling  Elders.  For  a  num- 
ber of  years  after  their  o"rganization  they  were  with- 
out a  settled  pastor,  but  were  supplied  with  preach- 
ing from  time  to  time  by  the  Presbytery.  In  1833 
they  built  a  church  on  the  lot  now  occupied  by  Cald- 
well's Block,  facing  west.  The  building  was  25x35 
feet,  and  was  erected  by  Sherman  Scofield.  The  lot 
was  deeded  to  Adam  Smeltser,  David  Ferree  and 
Julius  Whitmore,  the  Trustees,  by  John  Williams. 
It  was  dated  March  2,  1833.  They  hero  worshiped 
until  about  the  year  1845,  when  the  Trustees  sold  the 
property  to  George  Frybarger,  and  purchased  the 
j  ground  where  the  Christian  Church  now  stands,  from

HISTORY    OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


Abraham  B.  Conwell.     This  deed  was   made  April 
14,  1845. 

The  first  regular  pastor  of  the  church  of  which 
we  can  find  anj  record,  was  Rev.  J.  M.  Stone.  Mr. 
Stone  served  them  for  a  number  of  years,  when  his 
connection  with  them  as  pastor  was  dissolved,  and  he 
was  succeeded  by  Rev.  Charles  Sturdevant,  who  re- 
mained with  the  church  as  pastor  until  1848,  when 
his  successor  became  Rev.  William  Pelan.  Mr. 
Pelan  was  their  pastor  for  twenty  years,  preaching 
his  farewell  sermon  on  the  first  Sabbath  of  June, 
1868.  Mr.  Pelan  was  more  extensively  known  through- 
out this  valley  than  any  other  minister  of  that  denom- 
ination. He  was  a  popular  man  with  the  masses, 
both  in  and  out  of  the  church. 

From  the  fall  of  186S  until  the  fall  of  1869  the 
Rev.  H.  M.  Shockley  supplied  the  pulpit.  In  1870 
the  pulpit  was  supplied  by  Rev.  John  H.  Link,  of 
the  Evangelical  Lutheran  Church  of  this  city. 

In  1851  the  Hamilton  Presbytery  authorized  Rev. 
Daniel  Tenney,  of  Oxford,  to  organize  a  New  School 
Church  in  Connersville.  Accordingly,  on  the  16th  of 
August,  1851,  the  organization  was  effected  in  the 
Temperance  Hall.  James  McCann  and  P.  M.  Roots 
were  elected  Elders.  For  a  time  this  church  was 
supplied  with  ministers  by  order  of  their  Presbytery. 

The  following  ministers  have  served  this  branch, 
known  as  the  Second  Presbyterian  Chiirch,  in  the 
order  in  which  they  are  named:  Rev.  J.  Steward,  for 
two  years;  Rev.  James  Brownlee,  two  years;  Rev. 
Eli  B.  Smith,  two  years.  It  was  during  Mr.  Smith's 
administration,  and  on  the  3d  day  of  September, 
1855,  that  their  church  building  was  dedicated  to  the 
worship  of  Almighty  God.  Mr.  Smith  was  succeeded 
by  Rev.  B.  F.  Morris,  who  served  the  pastorate  two 
years.  He  was  followed  by  Rev.  Daniel  A.  Bassett, 
and  the  latter  by  Rev.  A.  D.  Jimeson.  Next  came 
Rev.  Alexander  Parker,  who  served  the  pastorate 
from  June  3,  1866,  to  October  24,  1870.  Mr.  Parker 
was  a  good  man  and  an  efficient  pastor. 

In  November,  1869,  in  the  city  of  Pitt8burgh,Penn., 
the  two  schools  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  of  the 
United  States  were  united,  and  on  the  24th  of  the 
following  October  the  First  and  Second  Churches  of 
Connersville  became  one  church.  April  6,  1871,  the 
building  of  the  Second  Church  was  chosen  by  vote  as 
the  house  of  worship.  The  building  was  repaired  in 
1876,  and  reopened  Sunday,  August  27,  1876,  with  a 
sermon  by  Dr.  Coojier,  of  Covington  Ky. 

The  Christian  Church. — In  the  summer  of  1832 
Dr.  R.  T.  Brown,  then  of  Rush  County,  settled  in 
Connersville,  and  here  engaged  in  the  practice  of 
medicine.  In  August  of  that  year  Gabriel  Ginn  and 
wife  Hannah  removed  to  town  from  the  Judge  Webb 
neighborhood  in  the  country.     These  were  all  mem- 


bers of  the  Reformed  Church,  as  it  was  designated; 
and  in  October  of  the  year  referred  to  above,  they  held 
services  in  the  court  house,  which  were  conducted  by 
Elder  John  O'Kane,  a  Virginian,  though  coming  to 
Milton  in  Wayne  County,  from  Lebanon,  O.,  in  the 
spring  of  1832.  O'Kane  was  engaged  in  teaching  at 
Milton  and  vicinity,  and  preached  on  Sunday  in  the 
country  schoolhouses.  The  meeting  at  the  court 
house  in  October  was  of  several  days  duration,  and 
resulted  in  a  number  of  acce-ssions  to  the  little  band. 
Elder  O'Kane  made  the  village  another  visit  on  Christ- 
mas, and  in  January,  1833,  the  church  was  organized; 
and  shortly  afterward  the  Elder  removed  to  Conners- 
ville. In  the  spring  following  Elder  Jesse  Holton 
removed  from  the  State  of  Kentucky  to  a  farm  some 
two  miles  north  of  Connersville.  Elders  Holton  and 
Brown  served  the  church  in  a  pastoral  relation  until 
the  former's  death  in  1839,  and  the  failing  health  of 
the  latter  caused  him  to  abandon  the  practice  of  medi- 
cine in  1841. 

Among  the  first  membership  of  the  church  were 
Dr.  R.  T.  Brown  and  wife,  Gabriel  Ginn  and  wife 
Hannah,  Jesse  Holton  and  wife,  also  son,  A.  C. 
Holton,  and  daughter  Elizabeth,  Mary  Helm,  Mrs. 
Jacob  Vandegrift,  Rhoda  McKinney  and  Elijah  West 
(colored). 

For  two  years  the  society  met  in  the  court  house, 
when  their  place  of  meeting  became  the  upper  room 
of  the  county  seminary,  which  was  occupied  until  the 
brick  building  on  the  bluff  on  East  Fifth  Street  was 
completed  in  January,  1841.  This  house  of  worship 
served  them  until  1872,  when  they  purchased  the 
church  building  they  now  occupy  on  West  Fourth 
Street,  of  the  Presbyterian  congregation,  which  they 
remodeled  and  improved  and  made  of  it  a  neat  and 
beautiful  church  edifice.  This  was  dedicated  June  1, 
1873,  with  a  sermon  delivered  by  Elder  Isaac  Errett, 
editor  of  the  Christian  Standard,  of  Cincinnati. 

Among  others  of  the  Eldei's  preaching  for  this 
people  have  been  Thomas  Conghley,  Jacob  Vail, 
Charles  Evans,  Rolla  Henry,  Samuel  Wilson,  Robert 
L.  Howe,  W.  J.  Irvin  and  A.  A.  Knight.  The  pres- 
ent Elder  of  the  charge  is  W.  W.  Witmer. 

St.  Gabriel's  Catholic  Church.  —  This  religious 
organization  has  had  an  existence  in  Connersville  for 
thirty-eight  years.  The  first  priest  visiting  Conners- 
ville in  a  missionary  sense  was  Rev.  Father  John 
Ryan,  in  1846;  he  was  then  a  resident  priest  of  the 
parish  at  Richmond,  this  State.  He  visited  the  people 
of  Connersville  until  in  the  summer  of  1848.  His 
successor  was  Rev.  Father  William  Doyle, who  too,  was 
a  resident  of  Richmond.  He  had  charge  of  the  Con- 
nersville Mission  from  May,  1849,  until  August,  1853. 
The  residence  of  Andrew  Apert  was  one  of  the  early 
places  where   mass  was  saidj  in  Connersville.     The

ground  on  North  Eastern  Avenue,  upon  which  now 
stands  the  old  brick  house  of  worship  of  the  parish, 
was  purchased  by  Father  Doyle,  and  the  church 
erected  thereon  in  1851  and  named  St.  Gabriel's. 
The  first  resident  priest  of  Connersville  was  Rev. 
Father  Henry  Peters,  who  came  to  the  parish  in  1853 
and  completed  the  church  structure  and  erected  the 
present  parsonage.  Father  Peters  served  the  church 
as  its  pastor  for  twenty-one  years,  severing  his  con- 
nection with  it  by  death,  in  January,  1874.  His  suc- 
cessor was  Rev.  Father  Peter  Bischof,  who,  in  1876, 
was  succeeded  by  Father  J.  B.  H.  Leepe,  and  he,  in 
1881,  by  Father  J.  Rudolph,  who  is  still   in  charge- 

The  present  magnificent  and  commodious  church 
edifice  of  the  congregation  was  commenced  in  the 
spring  of  1882,  the  corner-stone  being  laid  June  11 
of  that  year.  The  services  were  conducted  by  Rt. 
Rev.  Bishop  F.  S.  Chatard,  D.  D.,  of  Vincennes, 
assisted  by  Revs.  Ferdinand,  of  Indianapolis;  Peters, 
of  Oldenburg;  Fischer,  of  Reading,  Ohio;  DeArco, 
of  Liberty;  Oster,  of  Cambridge  City,  and  Rudolph, 
of  Connersville.  The  church  was  'dedicated  to  the 
service  of  Almighty  God,  June  15,  1884.  The  dedi- 
catory services  were  after  the  usual  custom  of  the 
church  on  such  occasions  and  were  imposing.  The 
same  Bishop  who  laid  the  corner-stone  conducted  the 
services  at  the  dedication  and  delivered  the  sermon. 
There  were  present  many  clergymen  from  various 
parts  of  the  country,  and  a  great  concourse  of  people 
who  participated  in  the  exercises. 

The  beautiful  edifice,  a  credit  to  its  builders,  and 
an  ornament  to  the  city,  is  located  in  the  northwest- 
ern part  of  the  city,  and  is  constructed  of  brick  with 
stone  trimmings.  It  is  of  Gothic  design.  The  architect 
was  D.  A.  Bohlen  of  Indianapolis,  and  it  was  built 
by  Downs,  Ready  &amp;  Co. ,  of  Connersville.  The 
length  of  the  building  is  165  feet;  width  56  feet 
proper,  and  75  feet  across  the  wings;  the  height  of 
the  ceiling  is  40  feet,  and  the  top  of  the  spire  is  185 
feet  from  the  gi-ound;  cost  of  building  in  the  neigh- 
borhood of  $30,000. 

On  the  erection  of  the  old  church  in  1851,  school 
was  held  in  the  small  basement  below.  In  1872  the 
present  commodious  brick  schoolhouse  was  com- 
pleted, since  which  time  the  schools  have  been  con- 
ducted by  the  Sisters  of  Providence. 

Trinity  Protestant  Episcopal  Church. — Episcopal 
services  were  commenced  in  this  parish  under  the 
charge  of  Rev.  William  Miller,  November  3,  1850, 
the  Town  Hall  being  used  for  the  purposes.  The 
organization  of  the  parish  was  accomplished  May  24, 
1852.  A  chapel  building  40x22  feet  adjoining  the 
present  edifice  was  erected  in  1855,  and  services  were 
'first  held  in  it  on  the  visitation  of  Bishop  Upfold, 
April  15,  1855. 


November  17,  1856,  the  corner-stone  of  the  pres- 
ent beautiful  edifice  situated  on  the  southeast  corner 
of  Eastern  Avenue  and  Sixth  Street  was  laid  by 
Bishop  Upfold  with  appropriate  religious  services. 
The  stone  was  laid  in  the  name  of  the  Holy  Trinity. 
At  the  site  of  the  church  the  Bishop  and  clergy  with 
the  congregation  read  alternately  the  122d  Psalm. 
A  number  of  articles  enclosed  in  a  leaden  box  were 
deposited  in  the  stone  by  the  Rector.  After  the  cere- 
monies they  proceeded  to  the  chapel, ^where^an  able 
and  eloquent  address  was  delivered  by  the  Bishop. 
The  edifice  was  completed  and  consecrated  Novem- 
ber 1,  1859,  by  Rt.  Rev.  George  Uphold,  D.  D., 
built  mainly  through  the  untiring  efforts  of  Mrs. 
Mary  S.  Helm.  The  style  of  the  building  is  early 
English  or  first  pointed,  purely  Gothic,  after  a 
chaste  and  beautiful  design  furnished  by  Frank 
Wills,  architect,  of  New  York.  Mr.  Miller  continued 
his  services  with  the  congregation  for  probably  a 
year  or  more,  and  later  Rev.  J.  W.  Stewart  became 
the  regular  Rector  of  the  church  and  served  for  a 
period  of  about  six  years,  closing  with  the  beginning 
of  the  war  of  the  Rebellion.  Missionaries  coming 
from  the  cities  of  Indianapolis  and  Richmond  served 
the  charge  for  a  time,  then  in  October,  1868,  Rev.  W. 
W.  Hibben  became  identified  with  the  parish  as  Lay 
Reader  and  was  subsequently  ordained  as  minister 
in  charge.  From  1873  to  1875  Rev.  J.  S.  Harrison, 
M.  D.,  served  the  parish  as  Missionary  Rector.  Sup- 
plies by  visiting  Rectors  were  then  had  until  in  1879, 
when  Rev.  Jesse  R.  Bicknell  gave  to  this  people  semi- 
monthly and  quarterly  Sunday  services,  and  follow- 
ing him  in  1880  Rev.  J.  Clausen,  who  gave  them 
regular  times  until  in  1881,  since  which  time  until 
the  spring  of  1884  they  have  been  under  the  mis- 
sionary auspices  of  Rev.  T.  Test,  M.  D.,  of  Richmond, 

The  German  Presbyterian,  Church  was  organized 
May  7,  1871,  by  Rev.  F.  F.  Friedgen,  of  Shelbyville. 
The  original  membership  was  twenty-four.  Until  in 
1873  services  were  held  in  the  Presbyterian  Church 
building  on  Fourth  Street,  now  the  house  of  worship 
of  the  Christian  society  of  the  city.  In  1873  the 
German  congregation  purchased  the  building  they 
have  since  occupied  of  the  Methodists,  for  which 
they  paid  $2,650.  It  is  a  one-story  brick  building 
with  basement,  located  on  Fourth  Street  between 
Water  and  Eastern  Avenue.  Mr.  Friedgen  has 
served  the  congregation  continuously  from  its  organi- 
zation, and  also  the  Sabbath-school  as  its  superin- 
tendent. The  present  church  membership  is  about 
eighty. 

The  African  Methodist  Episcopal  Church. — Some 
forty  odd  years  ago  a  few  of  the  colored  people  of 
the  city  and  vicinity  occasionally  assembled  for  relig- 
ious worship    wherever    suitable   quarters  could   be

found,  and  were  administered  to  by  Rev.  William 
Head,  of  Decatur  County.  In  an  upper  room  of  a 
building  on  the  Heineman  corner,  and  in  an  old  log- 
lioiise  in  the  northern  part  of  town  (on  Eastern 
Avenue)  were  amoag  the  places  above  referred  to 
where  worship  was  occasionally  held.  In  subsequent 
years  an  organization  was  effected,  and  the  little 
frame  church  building,  now  occupied  as  a  dwelling- 
house,  standing  on  the  brow  of  the  hill  just  east  of 
their  present  church,  was  erected,  which  was  used 
until  in  1872,  when  the  present  brick  house  of  wor- 
ship on  Fifth  Street  was  purchased  of  the  Christian 
Church  for  $2,500. 

Among  the  early  members  of  the  society  were  Mrs. 
Margaret  Turner,  George  Mitchell,  Mrs.  Dolly  Wil- 
son, James  Freeman  and  wife,  James  Franklin  and 
wife,  and  a  Mrs.  Powell. 

Revs.  Davis,  Woodfork,  Daniel  Winslow,  John 
Myers,  John  Payne  were  some  of  the  early  preachers 
in  charge  of  the  congregation.  Rev.  Charles  Jones 
is  the  present  pastor  of  the  church. 

The  German  United  Evangelical  Church  was 
organized  at  the  court  house,  in  August,  1882,  by 
Rev.  F.  E.  W.  Bersch,  with  a  membership  of  about 
forty  (heads  of  families).  Mr.  Bersch  served  the 
congregation  between  one  and  two  years,  when  suc- 
ceeded by  Rev.  C.  Thomas,  the  present  incumbent. 
The  society  is  without  a  church  building,  having 
worshiped    since  organization  in  the  City  Hall. 

SOCIETIES. 

Warren  Lodge,  No.  15,  F.  &amp;  A.  M.,  was  institu- 
ted under  a  charter  October  24,  1820,  in  an  upper 
room  of  Sample's  Hotel,  which  was  located  on  the 
Boutliwest  corner  of  what  is  now  Eastern  Avenue  and 
Fifth  Street.  On  this  date  the  following-named 
seven  men  met  for  the  purpose  named,  and  constitu- 
ted the  charter  members  of  the  Lodge:  John  Sam- 
ple, Edward  J.  Kidd,  John  Conner,  Larkin  Sims, 
Heni'y  Bates,  Julius  Whitmore  and  Joshua  Harlan. 
At  their  first  meeting  John  Newland  was  admitted  a 
Master  Mason  from  some  other  lodge,  and  four  peti- 
tions were  presented.  It  is  not  definitely  known  who 
was  the  first  Worshipful  Master  of  the  lodge,  but 
from  the  fact  that  the  name  of  John  Sample  appears 
as  approving  the  Treasui'er's  report  in  December, 
1821,  it  is  presumed  that  he  was  such  oiScor.  March 
13,  1824,  the  lodge  purchased  Lot  No.  18  of  Larkin 
Sims,  for  which  was  paid  $110.  March  30  of  the 
same  year  the  lodge  removed  to  a  two-story  frame 
building  standing  thereon.  This  was  subsequently 
sold  to  W.  M.  Smith  for  1400.  Their  next  place  of 
assembling  was  in  a  room  over  the  saddler  shop  of 
Joseph  Nelson,  which  was  on  Central  Avenue,  the 
first  meeting  at  this  place  being  held    May  29,  1847.

First  National  Bank,  northwest  corner  of  Central 
Avenue  and  Fifth  Street,  where  the  lodge  coatinued 
to  meet  until  the  completion  and  dedication  of  the 
present  commodious  hall,  the  third  story  of  the  City

EARLY  SETTLEMENTS  AND  INCIDENTS. 

The  first  settlement  in  the  township  was  made  at 
Conner's  trading-post  or  station,  some  time  between 
the  years  1804  and  1808.  Here  John  Conner  and 
family  are  believed  to  have  dwelt  for  several  years 
among  the  Indians,  with  no  white  neighbors  save 
those  on  East  Fork  and  on  West  Fork  in  what  are 
now  Union  and  Franklin  Counties.  However,  the 
lands  surrounding  him  were  settled  at  a  period  be- 
ginning about  the  year  1811. 

Alexander  Saxon  with  family  emigrated  from 
Georgia  in  the  fall  of  1811,  and  settled  on  the  south- 
east quarter  of  Section  25.  Near  a  point  opposite 
where  the  lower  mill  in  Connersville  now  stands,  was 
the  place  for  crossing  the  river.  Here  Mr.  Saxon 
kept  a  canoe,  and  ferried  travelers  across  the  river. 
n  The  localities  of  settlement  of  a  number  of  the 
following  named  pioneers  can  be  traced  by  reference 
to  the  land  entries  given  above.  Moses  Lookhart 
from  Kentucky,  settled  in  the  township  in  1812. 
Thomas  Reed,  from  the  same  State,  settled  the  same 
year.  Joseph  Minor  located  on  the  land  where  Joe 
and  Sam  Minor  now  live  in  1812.  John  and  Thomas 
Reed  built  cabins  on  the  same  land.  They  were 
father  and  son.     Larkin   Sims,  from  Kentucky,  and 


Tobias  Smith,  from  Virginia,  located  on  their  land  in 
1812. 

Thomas  Sergeant,  a  native  of  North  Carolina, 
removed  with  his  parents  to  Virginia  in  1796.  In 
1807  he  removed  to  Kentucky,  and  in  1813  to  Indiana 
Territory,  and  settled  south  of  Connersville.  In 
1820  he  entered  land  in  Rush  County  |at  the  land 
sales  at  Brookville,  and  that  winter  removed  thereon, 
cutting  the  road  for  the  wagon  as  he  went. 

Thomas  Hinkson  emigrated  from  Ireland  to 
America  in  1791,  subsequently  located  in  Adams 
County,  Ohio,  and  in  February,  1814,  settled  in  this 
township  on  the  land  where  his  son  Thomas,  Jr. ,  now 
resides,  which  he  had  entered  at  Cincinnati,  in  the 
year  1812.  The  elder  Thomas  Hinkson  was 
appointed  the  first  surveyor  of  the  county  by  Gov. 
Jennings,  which  position  he  occupied  a  number  of 
years.  He  did  much  of  the  early  surveying  in  this 
and  in  adjoining  counties,  having  laid  out  some  of 
the  early  additions  to  (Connersville.  His  death 
occurred  in  1850. 

John  McCormack  settled  in  the  vicinity  of  Con- 
nersville very  early,  and  in  the  act  forming  the 
county,  his  house  was  designated  as  the  place  for 
holding  the  first  courts.  Further  reference  is  made 
to  him  in  the  history  of  Columbia  Township. 

Nathaniel  Hamilton  and  family  emigrated  from 
Pennsylvania  to  Indiana  Territory  in  1810,  and 
located  above  Brookville  in  the  adjoining  county, 
where  they  remained  during  the  war  of  1812,  and  in 
the  spring  of  1815  removed  to  what  is  now  this  town- 
ship, on  land  entered  by  a  son,  Adam  Hamilton. 
Nathaniel,  Jr.,  a  son  of  the  pioneer,  was  born  in 
1798,  and  is  yet  a  resident  of  the  vicinity  where  he, 
with  his  parents,  located  nearly  seventy  years  ago. 
He  is  yet  in  possession  of  all  of  his  faculties,  with  a 
clear  mind,  and  is  remarkably  well  preserved  in  body. 
Two  of  the  sohs  of  Nathaniel,  Sr. ,  were  in  the  war  of 
1812. 

In  1815,  besides  those  heretofore  mentioned  (all 
of  whom  resided  west  of  the  river)  there  had  located 
on  the  same  side  of  that  stream  John  Philpott,  emi- 
grating from  Kentucky,  located  in  the  northern  part 
of  the  township  in  September,  1814  (on  the  Ezra 
Martin  farm);  Stanhope  and  Robert  Royster,  the 
former  of  whom  served  for  a  number  of  years  as 
County  Commissioner  and  one  of  the  Associate 
Judges  of  the  county;  John  Perin,  a  native  of  Mas- 
sachusetts, who  (in  1811)  settled  on  land  adjoining 
Hinkson;  Benjamin  Sailor  (of  the  family  who  set- 
tled early  in  Franklin  County)  resided  on  the  present 
farm  of  A.  B.  Claypool;  Paul  Davis,  son  of  George, 
and  James  Alexander,  from  South  Carolina;  Zach- 
ariah Glover  and  one  Hazlerigg;  a  Mr.  Lacy;  Benja- 
min Booe,  from  North  Carolina,  settled   in  Franklin

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


County  in  1810,  and  in  1814  removed  to  this  town- 
ship; Avery  Gates,  a  native  of  Massachusetts, 
though  for  years  a  resident  of  New  York,  from 
whence  he  emigrated  to  this  township  in  1817. 

James  Brownlee  emigrated  from  Ohio  to  Frank- 
lin County,  from  whence  he  was  gent  as  one  of  the 
delegates  to  frame  the  State  Constitution.  He  came 
to  this  township  about  the  year  1816,  and  subsequently 
filled  the  office  of  Associate  Judge,  and  was  a  man 
of  some  prominence. 

John  Miller,  from  Scott  County,  Ky.,  settled  west 
of  Connersville  in  1819. 

Of  those  who  settled  east  of  the  river  early  was 
William  Sparks,  who  had  early  emigrated  from  Lau- 
rens District,  S.  C,  and  settled  east  of  East  Fork,  in 
what  is  now  Union  County,  and  in  October,  1814, 
removed  to  the  Stephen  Stoops  place.  James  O'Dare, 
from  the  same  State, settled  in  the  same  neighborhood 
about  that  time.  South  of  Sparks  located  Nathan 
Aldridge,  from  Tennessee,  in  1814.  In  the  same 
vicinity  and  about  1814  or  1815  settled  Samuel 
Harlan  from  South  Carolina,  James  Tweedy,  Corne- 
lius Williams  and  William  Edwards. 

Joseph  Justice  emigrated  to  Indiana  Territory  in 
1811,  and  located  in  the  vicinity  of  Connersville  in 
1815. 

John  Swift  with  his  parents,  from  the  State  of 
New  Jersey,  settled  in  Ohio,  and  in  1818  came  to 
what  is  now  Connersville  Township. 

William  Jones, from  Bracken  County,  Ky.  (though 
a  Virginian),  with  parents  settled  here  in  1816. 

In  1813  Douglass  Burton,  with  family,  emigrated 
from  South  Carolina  to  Scott  County,  Ky.,  and  in 
1819  located  on  land  north  of  Connersville,  just  over 
the  line  in  Harrison  Township,  where  the  father  died 
the  summer  following,  aud  soon  thereafter  the  widow 
with  her  children  removed  to  what  is  now  the  Infirm- 
ary Farm.  Calvin  Barton  and  brother  Thomas,  yet 
residents  of  Connersville  and  vicinity,  are  two  of  the 
number. 

The  following  extracts  are  from  a  letter  written 
for  the  Examiner,  in  which  it  appeai-ed  in  1878  over 
the  signature  of  Brutus.  The  writer's  early  home  was 
in  the  vicinity  of  Longwood,  which  he  bad  been 
absent  from  for  a  period  of  fifteen  years: 

"  Fifty  years  since  I  'pitched  my  tent'ou  tlie  shores  of  this 
beautiful  stream  (Williams  Creek).  Scarcely  a  soul  lives  here 
now  that  lived  here  then.  What  is  called  the  '  rolling  prairie, ' 
the'farm  of  Garner  Clawson,  was  then  owned  by  one  Car- 
michael.  He  sold  it  to  John  Trent  and  John  Alexander.  Dan. 
iel  Cunningham,  a  Baptist  preacher,  owned  the  farm  where 
Willis  Ball's  stone  quarry  now  is.  little  dreaming  that  such 
huge  slabs  of  flagging  were  lying  beneath  bis  hallowed  feet, 
while  Amos  Smith,  a  brick  mason,  lived  on  the  farm  now 
owned  by  John  Tate.  John  McCrory,  an  Irishman  from 
Pennsylvania,  settled  where  James  Ochiltree  now  lives. 
He  was  a  tailor  by  trade  and  a  good  citizen.     He  lived  until 


a  few  years  ago,  and  died  leaving  a  number  of  descendants, 
most  of  whom  live  in  this  county.  At  that  time  John  and 
Benjamin  Huston  owned  the  farm  now  in  possession  of 
Robert  Moffett.  They  sold  it  to  John  Kellum,  a  citizen  from 
Preble  County,  Ohio.  This  farm  supported  a  still-house 
under  the  control  of  John  Philpott,  who  also  run  another 
one  on  the  farm  now  owned  by  Ezra  Martin,  but  which 
belonged  to  him  at  that  time.  A  little  further  up  the  creek 
lived  an  excellent  character  by  the  name  of  John  Horsley. 
Frederick  Sane  lived  on  the  same  farm.  Jonathan  McCarty, 
a  Member  of  Congress,  owned  eighty'  acres  just  west  of  Hors- 
leys,  which  in  later  years  was  known  as  '  Manis  Porch,'  and 
was  a  great  resort  for  the  boys.  The  farm  is  now  possessed 
by  Justice  Reese  and  '  Dest-a-gob  '  was  its  occupant.  John 
Philpott  and  his  son  Will  entered  the  farm  known  as  the 
Moffett  farm  in  1838,  and  erected  a  flouring-mill  thereon.  A 
postofBce  was  afterward  estaVilished  here  called  Philpott's 
Mills.  The  name  was  afterward  changed  to  Longwood,  by 
Ross  Smiley,  in  honor  of  the  home  of  Napoleon  at  St.  Helena. 
Mr.  Smiley  was  the  Postmaster  for  a  quarter  of  a  century. 
Dr.  Ball  came  from  Ohio  and  settled  where  his  son  Willis 
now  lives,  and  has  long  since  gone  to  that  bourne  from  whence 
there  is  no  return.  Jacob  Smith,  a  Pennsylvanian,  and  a 
Revolutionary  soldier,  the  grandfather  of  our  fellow-citizen, 
Sanford  Smith,  settled  on  the  farm  upon  which  Sanford  is 
now  nobly  supporting  his  estimable  mother.  It  was  at  the 
battle  of  Trenton,  that,  being  hotly  pursued  by  the  British, 
he  took  his  stand  on  a  high  bridge,  solitary  and  alone,  and 
as  the  enemy  advanced  he  would  pitch  them  over  the  side  of 
the  bridge  with  his  bayonet,  far  down  in  the  water  below. 
He  disposed  of  a  score  or  two  in  this  way.  when  the  enemy 
yielded,  and  Jacob  came  off  victorious;  he  fought  nobly. 
Zachariah  Glover  then  lived  where  Sam  Atherton  now  resides, 
and  ran  a  still-bouse.  He  sold  to  John  Smiley,  and  he  to 
Stout  Atherton.  Isaac  Martin  lived  at  the  cross-roads  just 
east  of  here,  and  was  known  as  '  Amazing  Grace,'  on  account 
of  its  piety.  Timothy  Orr  lived  where  Theodore  Applegate 
now  lives.  John  Hawkins  entered  eighty  acres  where  Sisson 
Joe  now  lives,  after  which  he  bought  of  Daniel  Campbell,  160 
acres  joining  him  on  the  east.  John  Philpott,  Jr.,  entered  the 
Uncle  George  Smith  farm,  and  built  a  meeting-house  on  what 
is  now  John  Ludlow's  farm  in  the  year  1842.  He  was  a  Uoi- 
versalist  in  belief,  and  did  all  he  could  for  the  advancement 
of  religion.  The  house  was  dedicated  by  a  Methodist  minis- 
ter by  the  name  of  Stone,  who  lived  where  Hamilton  White 
now  resides.  Quite  a  number  of  the  old  pioneer  preachers 
used  to  preach  there,  among  whom  were  James  Smith,  Peter 
Wiles,  Arthur  Miller,  George  Campbell,  Jacob  Daubenspeck 
and  a  great  many  others.  Still-bouses  used  to  be  numerous. 
There  was  one  at  Benjamin  Booe's,  Josh  Wallace's  and  John 
Trents'.  It  was  at  the  latter  place  that  a  man  by  the  name 
of  Massey  shot  and  killed  a  negro.  Massey  made  his  escape 
and  never  was  heard  of  after.  John  Ludlow,  who  is  still 
among  us,  came  here  in  1839  and  is  one  of  the  oldest  residents 
in  this  part  of  the  county.        ****** 

Jonathan  John,  from  Kentucky,  settled  in  the 
vicinity  of  Connersville  in  1816.  He  resided  on  the 
hill  west  of  the  city  and  his  name,  as  will  be  noticed 
by  the  reader  who  peruses  the  pages  of  this  volume, 
was  closely  indentified  with  the  business  interests  of 
the  county.  He  was  an  intimate  friend  of  the  Indian 
trader,  John   Conner.      His  death  occurred   in  1838. 

The  Adairs,  Russells  and  Martins  settled  in  the 
township  early.  About  1819  the  McCrorys,  John  and 
William,  settled  in  the  township.      Jeremiah  Worgh-

aman  from  Virginia,  located  along  the  river  in 
1811.  John  Baily  and  family,  from  the  State  of 
Kentucky,  removed  to  Connersville  in  1819,  and  sub- 
sequently located  on  a  farm  five  miles  west  of  the  vil- 
lage. Thomas  White,  from  Tennessee,  with  parents, 
settled  quite  early  in  the  township.  Justice  Wright 
located  on  Fall  Creek  in  1821.  He  was  a  native  of 
Pennsylvania.  As  early  as  1812  Joseph  Minor,  a 
native  of  Kentucky,  located  where  his  son  Joseph  now 
resides.  In  1814  J.  F.  Marshall,  a  native  of  Vir- 
ginia, located  in  the  township.  William  Edwards,  a 
native  of  Maryland,  settled  here  in  1817,  also  Rawl- 
ston  Shields,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  the  same  year. 
W.  H.  H.  Tate  settled  here  early. 

Hon.  Oliver  H.  Smith,  in  his  "Early  Indiana," 
thus  speaks  of  one  of  the  early  settlers  of  the  vicinity  of 
Connersville:  "In  early  times  before  the  first  land 
sales  of  the  beautiful  Whitewater  Valley,  where  Con- 
nersville, Liberty,  Cambridge  City,  Centerville  and 
Richmond  now  stand,  there  lived  upon  the  east  bank 
of  Whitewater,  a  mile  above  Connersville,  a  most 
remarkable  woman  by  the  name  of  Betty  Frazier. 
She  was  a  small,  tough  looking,  rather  swarthy, 
woman.  Her  husband,  George  Frazier,  was  a  poor 
cripple,  and  with  their  children  was  entirely  sup- 
ported by  Betty.  They  had  settled  upon  a  small 
fraction  of  Government  land,  intending  to  purchase 
at  the  sales.  The  land  office  was  at  Cincinnati,  and 
Gen.  James  Findley  was  the  receiver.  The  spring  of 
the  year,  after  a  severe  winter,  had  come;  the  sales 
were  to  take  place  the  next  winter,  and  Betty  had  the 
season  before  her  to  raise  the  money  to  pay  for  her 
land.  She  commenced  with  a  young  stock  of  hogs, 
caring  for  them  daily,  driving  them  to  the  best  mast, 
and  preparing  a  good  patch  of  corn  for  the  fattening 
process.  She  had  one  horse  only  to  tend  her  crop, 
and  to  ride  to  Cincinnati  when  she  drove  her  hogs 
down  to  sell,  and  buy  her  land. 

"  One  day  about  mid-summer  she  saw  a  horseman 
ride  up  to  her  cabin  in  full  uniform.  She  met  him 
at  the  bars:  'Well  Gen.  Hanna,  how  do  you  do?' 
'Very  well,  Mrs.  Frazier.'  'What  on  earth  has 
brought  you  all  the  way  from  Brookville  to  my  poor 
cabin ? '  'I  am  very  sorry  to  tell  you,  Mrs.  Frazier, 
that  I  am  the  Sheriff,  and  have  an  execution  against 
your  property.'  '  Well,  General,  I  always  submit  to 
the  law;  come  with  me  to  the  stable  and  I  will  give 
you  my  only  horse,  as  the  best  I  can  do. '  There  were 
no  '  exemption  laws  '  then.  Betty  and  the  General 
proceeded  to  the  stable.  It  was  a  strong  log  build- 
ing with  a  single  door,  no  window,  overlaid  with  a 
solid  platform  of  logs,  and  filled  above  with  hay  for 
the  horse.  The  door  fastened  outside  with  a  large 
wooden  pin  in  a  log.  '  There,  General,  is  the  horse — 
take  him.'     The  General  stepped  in  and  commenced 


untying  the  horse.  Betty  immediately  fastened  the 
door  outside,  driving  the  pin  into  the  hole  to  its  full 
length,  and  left  the  General  to  his  reflections  while 
she  attended  to  her  household  affairs.  Time  passed 
away;  night  came  on,  but  no  relief  to  the  captured 
General.  Morning  came,  and  with  it  came  Betty. 
'  Well,  General,  how  did  you  sleep  last  night.'  '  Not 
very  well.  I  am  ready  to  compromise  this  matter;  if 
you  will  let  me  out  and  show  me  the  ford  over  White- 
water (the  river  was  muddy  and  high),  I  will  leave 
you  and  the  horse  and  return  the  execution  '  no  prop- 
erty found.'  'Upon  honor?'  '  Yes,  upon  honor.' 
Betty  opened  the  door.  The  General  mounted  his 
horse  and  silently  followed  Betty  down  to  the  river 
side.  '  There,  General,  you  will  go  in  just  above  the 
big  sycamore,  and  come  out  at  that  haw-bush  you  see.' 
The  General  started;  at  the  second  step  both  horse 
and  rider  were  under  water  out  of  sight,  and  the 
chapeau  of  the  General  was  floating  down  the  river. 
Still,  he  being  one  of  the  pioneer.s,  and  bis  horse  a 
trained  swimmer,  gallantly  stemmed  the  current,  and 
exactly  struck  the  haw-bush,  his  horse  swimming  to 
the  very,  shore,  while  Betty  stood  on  the  bank  scream- 
ing, '  I  guess  the  Brookville  oflicers  will  let  me 
alone  now  until  I  have  sold  my  pigs  and  bought  my 
land.'  The  General  rode  on  dripping  wet  to  his 
brigade  that  mustered  that  day.  But  the  end  was  not 
yet.  Time  rolled  on;  the  pigs  grew  to  be  well  fatted 
hogs.  Betty  mounted  her  pony;  the  little  boys 
started  the  pigs  for  Cincinnati;  they  had  ten  days  to 
get  there  before  the  land  sales;  the  distance  was 
about  seventy  miles.  Nothing  unusual  occurred  on 
the  road  until  they  arrived  at  New  Trentoi,  at  Squire 
Rockafellow's.  The  night  was  stormy;  the  snow  fell 
deep;  next  morning  found  Betty  at  the  usual  hour  on 
the  pony,  well  wrapped,  with  an  infant  a  few  hours 
old  on  her  bosom.  She  arrived  with  her  hogs  at 
Cincinnati  the  day  before  the  sale,  sold  them  for 
cash,  and  the  late  Gen.  Findlay  told  me  that  she 
stood  by  his  side  on  the  box  and  bid  off  her  land, 
with  her  infant  in  her  arms.  Surely,  '  truth  is 
stranger  than  fiction.'  " 

About  the  year  1818  on  the  Larkin's  Sims  farm 
just  below  Connersville  was  erected  for  that  gentle- 
man, it  is  thought,  the  first  frame  house  in  the  town- 
ship (outside  of  the  village  of  Connersville.)  It 
was  built  by  John  Perin. 

In  1823  or  1824  the  frame  portion  of  the  dwelling 
house  of  Thomas  Hinkson  was  erected  and  the  large 
stone  house — the  main  building,  which,  by  the  way, 
is  very  antique  in  its  style  of  architecture,  was  built 
in  1827,  as  shown  by  an  inscription  on  a  stone  form- 
ing a  part  of  the  chimney. 

The  John  Perin  brick  house  on  the  N.  Minor  farm 
was  built  in  1824.

HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


EAKLY    SCHOOLS. 

The  first  schoolhouse  in  the  settlement  along  the 
western  side  of  the  river,  and  about  Williams'  Creek, 
was  built  prior  to  the  spring  of  1815;  for  it — the  rude 
log-cabin  house — was  standing  there,  on  the  Hinkson 
farm,  at  that  time,  and  the  following  winter,  1815- 
16,  school  was  taught  in  it  by  Thomas  Hinkson,  Sr. 
At  this  time  Nathaniel  Hamilton  attended  the  school. 
Mr.  Hinkson  was  the  teacher  in  that  settlement  for 
a  number  of  years.  He  was  a  man  of  liberal  educa- 
tion, having  been  schooled  in  his  native  county  in  a 
Catholic  school.  Mr.  Hamilton  is  of  the  opinion 
that  school  had  been  previously  held  in  this  house 
by  the  same  master.  In  this  same  settlement  in 
1819,  in  a  log-cabin  near  where  the  Lockhart  school - 
house  now  is.  Miss  lugham  is  remembered  as  holding 
school.  Later  teachers  in  the  same  settlement  were 
Hannah  Hathaway,  John  Justice  and  Millie  Perin. 
Subsequently  the  scholars  too  far  to  the  north  attend- 
ed one  of  the  schoolhouses  located  in  Harrison 
Township  and  described  in  the  sketch  of  that  sub- 
division. 

In  the  settlement  east  of  the  river  was  what  was 
known  as  "Solomon's  school."  An  account  of  this 
school  was  written  some  years  since  by  "Rambler," 
which  is  given  below:  "The  house  in  which  it  was 
taught  stood  fifty  or  sixty  rods  nearly  east  of  the 
present  residence  of  John  Stoops,  near  the  south  line 
of  the  land  of  Robert  Williams,  and  was  with  slight 
exceptions  such  a  house  as  all  the  girls  and  boys  of 
those  days  got  their  education  in.  And  from  such 
schoolhouses,  scattered  over  the  great  West,  have 
gone  out  men  of  honest  hearts,  of  strong  nerves,  of 
high  and  noble  resolves,  that  have  made  their  mark 
in  the  world.  And  could  we  trace  through  the  high- 
ways, the  by-ways,  and  the  cross-ways  of  life  all  that 
attended  that  school,  no  doubt  but  we  could  find  some 
occupying  prominent  public  positions  both  in  church 
and  in  state  at  the  present  time.  We  have  never 
met  any  of  the  scholars  of  that  school  but  two  since 
1822,  and  both  of  these  were  ministers  in  the  Baptist 
Church  (Elders  George  Harlan  and  William  Sparks). 

"The  building  was  about  18x22  feet,  of  round 
logs,  with  a  fire-place  occupying  one  end  of 
it,  and  a  file  of  six  or  eight  boys  were  usually 
detailed  to  carry  in  the  back-logs,  while  the  lesser 
ones  carried  in  the  fore,  middle  and  top  sticks,  and 
occasionally  this  huge  pile  of  wood  and  the  fire  made 
by  it  would  cause  the  cry  of  tire  to  be  raised  by  some 
who  were  watching  other  things  closer  than  their 
books.  The  windows  consisted  of  one  log  removed 
from  each  of  the  three  sides  of  the  building,  slats 
placed  vertically  in  the  space,  and  newspapers  pasted 
on  those  slats  and  to  the  log  above,  then  the  paper 
oiled   with  melted   lard    applied    with    a   feather  to 


admit  the  light,  then  a  temporary  fortification,  con- 
sisting of  forks  and  poles  was  thrown  up  to  prevent 
the  stock  from  eating  out  the  paper,  thus  saturated 
with  the  grease.  The  furniture  in  the  room  was  as 
simple  and  primitive  as  the  room  itself.  The  writing- 
tables  were  one  long  board  under  each  window  and 
the  same  length  of  it,  attached  to  the  wall,  and  driv- 
ing pins  therein,  inclining  a  little  downward  at  the 
outer  end.  At  these  the  tables  were  placed, each  writer 
sitting  with  his  face  to  the  window.  The  seats  consisted 
of  blue  ash  saplings, cut  the  j)roper  length, split  in  two, 
two  holes  bored  at  proper  angles  in  each  end,  and 
one  in  the  middle  for  legs,  then  placed  with  the  bark 
side  up,  the  bark  being  all  nicely  shaved  off.  On 
these  seats  have  we  sat  swinging  our  feet  back  and 
forth  from  early  dawn  to  laterst  eve,  wishing  we  were 
anything  else  but  a  school-boy;  wishing  there  was  no 
such  thing  as  a  schoolhouse,  school-  teachers,  school- 
books,  pen,  ink  or  paper  in  the  world.  Foolish,  in- 
considerate, childish  thought.  But  then  we  thought 
and  acted  and  talked  like  a  boy,  but  since  we  have 
viewed  things  from  a  different  standpoint. 

"Could  the  schoolboy  of  the  present  day  com- 
pare the  stock  of  books  now  in  use  in  the  schools 
with  that  used  in  those  primitive  times,  he  could 
appreciate  his  advantages  over  those  of  the  early  set- 
tlers of  the  country.  Geography,  grammar,  globes, 
out-line  maps,  and  other  modern  facilities  for  study 
were  neither  seen  nor  talked  of  in  the  school  room 
of  those  days. 

"There  is  one  tribute  of  respect  we  willingly  pay 
to  the  teacher,  and  that  is,  considering  the  time,  the 
surroundings  and  the  facilities,  he  taught  a  very 
good  school. 

"In  those  days  there  were  certain  inalienable  rights 
claimed  by  the  school-boys,  which  had  been  handed 
down  from  time  immemorial  from  father  to  son,  and 
that  was  the  right  to  close  the  door  against  school- 
teachers  about  the  holidays;  a  right,  too,  to  which  in 
some  localities  they  still  adhere  with  the  same  ten- 
acity that  a  descendant  of  Abraham  adheres  to  his 
nationality.  Now  the  big  boys  and  the  little  boys 
were  not  willing  that  this  time-honored  usage  should 
pass  by  unimproved  on  the  present  occasion.  Accord- 
ingly a  council  of  war  was  held  and  the  subject  dis- 
cussed in  the  most  formal  manner,  the  question  being: 
Shall  we  bar  out  the  teacher  and  make  him  treat  f 
was  put  and  carried  by  such  a  vote  that  no  veto  could 
set  aside.  The  nest  great  question  was.  How  shall 
the  castle,  windows,  door  and  chimney  be  so  fortified 
that  a  successful  attack  cannot  be  made  either  from 
the  front,  fiank  or  rear.  To  do  this,  bolts,  bars, 
benches,  spikes,  with  a  large  lot  of  other  weapons, 
offensive  and  defensive,  were  called  into  requision, 
not  forgetting  a  good  supply  of  fuel  and    provisions;

for  the  siege  might  last  several  days.  Morning  came 
and  with  it  came  hope,  fear,  doubt,  anxiety,  solicitude, 
as  to  the  result.  Directly  the  teacher  is  seen  in  the 
distance,  approaching  the  scene  of  contest  quietly  and 
peacefully ;  he  comes  on  unconscious  of  the  spirit  of 
mutiny  and  rebellion  within.  He  comes  to  the  door, 
attempts  to  open  it;  all  is  silence  within;  he  guesses 
the  cause,  retreats,  reconnoiters,  examines  the  vulner- 
able points,  gathers  a  huge  rail  and  in  old  Roman 
style  tries  his  battering  ram  on  the  door  once.  Crash  it 
comes  against  the  door.  He  retreats  to  a  greater  dis- 
tance to  give  it  greater  momentum.  Crash  it  comes 
the  second  time,  down  comes  the  door,  in  comes  the 
rail  full  length  into  the  school-room;  all  is  hurry- 
skurry  within,  and  during  the  general  fright,  the 
teacher  enters  through  the  breach.  '  Seize  him  and 
tie  him,'  was  the  rallying  cry.  It  was  like  magic; 
soon  he  was  surrounded,  borne  down  by  the  crowd, 
who  had  merged  all  dignity  in  the  right  of  the 
scholar.  The  teacher  comes  to  terms,  is  released,  and 
soon  a  equad  of  these  quandam  rebels  is  sent  off  to 
bring  the  treat.  Meantime  the  benches  are  righted, 
the  door  is  repaired,  the  good  things  come,  all  par- 
take, and  care  nothing  whether  they  were  Presidents 
or  plebians.  Thus  passed  the  Christmas  of  1818  at 
the  old  log  schoolhouse.  For  the  purpose  of  show- 
ing the  changes  in  a  place  since  that  time  we  give  the 
names  of  some  who  attended  the  school.  There  were 
the  Gilkeys,  Sparkea,  Aldridges,  Harlans,  Thomases, 
Streets,  Whites,  Denisons,  McCreas,  and  Williamses. 
In  the  southeastern  part  of  the  township  Jonathan 
Shields  taught  an  early  school. 

EARLY  MILLS,  DISTILLERIES,    ETC. 

Among  the  early  industries  of  the  township,  out- 
side of  the  village,  were,  lirst,  the  John  Reed  grist- 
mill, which  was  ia  operation  in  the  spring  of  1815; 
it  was  probably  built  in  1814.  The  mill  was  first 
constructed  of  logs  in  their  natural  state,  but  in  the 
course  of  a  year  or  more  a  frame  mill  building  was 
constructed.  The  site  of  the  mill  was  on  Williams 
Creek,  some  three  or  four  miles  below  Connersville. 
In  1816  a  saw-mill  was  added.  John  A.  White  hewed 
the  timber  for  it  and  assisted  in  its  construction. 

Prior  to  1819  John  Vance  built  a  grist-mill  on 
Williams  Creek. 

John  Hughes,  as  early  as  1820,  had  in  operation 
a  grist-mill  on  the  same  stream,  on  the  J.  Mounts 
farm. 

James  Brownlee  built  what  subsequently  became 
known  as  the  Nathan  Buckley  carding  and  fulling 
mill  or  machine.  This  was  on  Williams  Creek,  and 
was  erected  as  early  as  1818,  if  not  earlier.  Brownlee 
built  in  connection  with  it  a  saw-mill,  and  in  1825, 
or  thereabouts,  built  a  frame-  for  a  grist-mill,   which, 


however,  was  never  used  for  that  purpose.  Mr.  Buck- 
ley having  purchased  the  property,  removed  the 
carding -machine  into  that  frame. 

Further  up  the  same  stream,  Avery  Gates  subse- 
quently erected  a  saw- mill. 

On  the  river,  west  side,  was  operated  an  early 
mill  by  Miller  and  Clink;  later  William  Miller 
added  to  it  a  still-house  and  an  oil-mill. 

In  the  northwestern  part  of  the  township,  on 
Williams'  Creek,  an  early  saw-mill  was  built  by 
John  Kellum,  and  below  on  the  same  stream,  he 
operated  a  grist-mill. 

Thomas  Moflfett,  who  owned  and  operated  a  mill 
in  Harrison  Township,  which  had  been  built  by  John 
Philpott,  subsequently  (1847),  erected  a  grist-mill 
further  down  the  stream,  in  what  is  now  Conners- 
ville Township. 

Stills  were  then  numerous,  for  'twas  in  a  day 
when  whisky  and  religion  were  not  divorced,  but 
went  hand  in  hand.  The  smoke  from  the  little  cop- 
per still  or  from  the  larger  distillery  could  be  seen 
curling  heavenward  from  many  a  pioneer's  land. 
Among  those  then  distilling  were  Thomas  Burris  and 
Glover  Perin,  one  Calloway,  Jphn  Perin,  John  Reed, 
William  Miller,  Tobias  Smith,  Larkin  Sims,  William 
Thompson,  James  Vance  and  many  others. 

East  of  the  river,  on  Village  Creek,  in  1829, 
Christian  Furry  was  operating  a  grist-mill  with  one 
run  of  stones.  This  mill  is  thought  to  have  been 
built  by  Moses  Wolverton,  who  also  had  in  connec- 
tion with  it  a  saw-mill. 

CHURCHES  AND    GRAVEYARDS. 

At  the  old  burying-ground,  in  Section  20,  on  the 
E.  Martin  land  in  an  early  day,  was  built  an  Old 
School  Baptist  Church,  which  was  used  by  that 
denomination  for  a  number  of  years. 

The  earliest  grave  marked  by  a  tomb-stone,  whose 
inscription  is  legible,  is  that  of  Nesbit  Alexander, 
who  died  May  27,  1825,  in  the  twenty  fifth  year  of 
his  age.  Among  the  aged  whose  remains  rest  hero 
are  Samuel  Martin,  died  in  1851,  at  the  age  of 
seventy-two  years;  Ann  Martin,  in  1863,  seventy- 
nine  years;  Alexander  Saxon,  in  1844,  seventy  seven 
years;  Mary  Saxon,  in  1855,  eighty-one  years;  Philip 
C.  Hoyl,  in  1841,  eighty-eight  years;  Benjamin 
Booe,  in  1839,  sixty  years. 

At  the  graveyard  on  the  hill  by  the  creek  on  the 
James  Mount  land  stood  a  meeting-house  built  prob- 
ably forty  odd  years  ago  by  the  Methodists,  and  by 
them  was  occupied  for  many  years,  and  later  by  other 
denominations,  but  all  traces  of  it  are  now  lost  to  the 
passer-by,  and  the  few  tomb-stones  around  the  yard 
marking  spots  sacred  to  many  have  been  suffered  to 
fall   down,   and  are  now  scattered  over  the  ground,

trampeled  on  and  rooted  about  by  cattle  and  hogs 
which  are  let  at  large  to  roam  about  the  hallowed 
spot. 

The  first  Methodist  preaching  place  on  the  Gon- 
nersville  Circuit  in  the  township  was  at  the  dwelling 
of  the  grandfather  of  Thomas  Hinkson.  In  18'J3  the 
class  consisted  of  the  grandfather  and  wife,  son 
Thomas  the  surveyor  and  wife,  Mrs.  Basil  Roberts 
and  daughters  and  Merrill  Williams. 

There  are  now  but  two  churches  in  the  township, 
Bunker  Hill  and  Village  Creek.  The  former  is  a 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church  and  the  latter  an  Old 
School  Baptist. 

The  building,  which  is  of  brick,  of  the  former 
denomination  is  the  second  house  of  worship.  Both 
it  and  the  original  building  were  erected  by  general 
subscriptions,  and  were  to  be  used  by  all  denomina- 
tions as  a  Union  Church.  The  Methodists  have  for 
probably  fifteen  or  twenty  years  held  regular  services 
at  Banker  Hill,  the  appointment  being  with  some  of 
the  other  churches  along  the  western  portion  of  the 
county. 

The  Village  Creek  Church  was  constituted  July 
24,  1824:,  Elders  and  Messengers  being  present  from 
Lick  Creek,  New  Bethel  and  New  Hope  Churches. 
The  constituent  members  were  Robert  Gilky,  Thomas 
Wolverton,  William  Denman,  William  Sparks,  Phin- 
eaa  McCray,  Stephen  Harlan,  James  Wood,  Sarah 
Gilky,  Mary  Donman,  Mary  Sparks,  Mary  Harlan, 
Sarah  McCray  and  Hannah  McCray.  The  constitu- 
tion took  place  at  the  residence  of  Robert  Gilky. 
The  first  house  of  worship  was  not  built  until  1826, 
meetings  up  to  its  completion  being  held  at  private 
houses.  This  hewed-log  building  was  the  meeting- 
house of  the  church  society  until  in  1848,  when  it  was 
replaced  by  the  present  brick  edifice  located  at  the 
burying-ground  on  the  hill,  probably  one  and  a  half 
miles  southeast  of  the  city  of  Connersville.  The  reg- 
ular resident  pastors  of  the  church  have  been  Elders 
Minor  Thomas,  George  Harlan  (ordained  in  1830), 
William  Sparks  (ordained  in  1845),  Samuel  Harlan 
and  Walter  Benson  and  Charles  M.  Reed,  the  present 
incumbent.  The  present  membership  of  the  church 
is  fifty-six.  The  entire  number  of  members  that  have 
been  identified  with  the  church  since  its  constitution 
has  been  271. 

The  graveyard  of  the  church,  it  wovild  seem  from 
the  following  epitaph  on  the  tomb-stone  of  Samuel 
Harlan,  Sr.,  was  set  apart  for  such  purposes  by  him: 

"This  ground  he  did  donate 
In  which  to  bury  dead, 
And  when  he  cheerful  met  his  fate 
He  among  the  rest  was  laid." 

Mr.  Harlan  died  in  1858,  aged  eighty-five  years. 
This  place  of  burial  is  about  as  old  as  the  church 


organization.  Among  the  aged  who  are  here  await- 
ing the  final  resurrection  morn,  are  Sarah  McCray, 
died  in  1851  in  her  ninetieth  year;  Phineaa  McCray, 
died  in  1838  in  his  seventy-sixth  year;  Nancy  Harlan, 
died  in  1871  in  her  ninety-third  year;  Judith  Honey- 
well, died  in  1860  in  her  eightieth  year;  Abner  Ball, 
born  in  1785,  died  in  1846;  Rhoda  P.  Ball,  born  in 
1787,  died  in  1863;  William  Sparks,  Sr.,  died  in 
1862  in  his  ninetieth  year;  John  Milliner,  born  in 
1786,  died  in  1856;  Nancy  Milliner,  born  in  1786, 
died  in  1873;  James  Backhouse,  died  in  1849  in  his 
eighty-seventh  year;  Charlotte  Backhouse,  died  in 
1864  in  her  eighty-fifth  year;  Bennett  Langston,  died 
in  1860  in  his  eighty-fourth  year. 

EAST    CONNEESVILLE. 

Just  over  the  river  from  the  city  of  Connersville,  is 
situated  the  village  of  East  Connersville,  which  was 
laid  out  on  the  northwest  quarter  of  Section  19, 
Township  14,  Range  11,  by  Basil  MeCann,  in  Octo- 
ber, 1857.  The  village  has  since  been  incorporated 
and  is  provided  with  a  substantial  two-story  brick 
sehoolhouse;  and  in  the  way  of  industries  has  two 
stores,  a  blacksmith  shop,  and  a  large  planing-mill 
and  wood-working  establishment,  which  had  its  origin 
some  ten  years  ago,  in  the  Eagle  Mills  Manufacturing 
Company. 

MAPLEWOOD. 

The  little  village  bearing  the  above  name  is  sub- 
urban to  Connersville,  and  was  laid  out  on  the  land 
of  Austin  B.  Claypool,  being  acknowledged  by  that 
gentleman  March  13,  1877.  In  1882  a  large  and 
substantial  two-story  brick  sehoolhouse,  beautiful  in 
design,  was  erected  in  the  place,  and  at  this  writing 
there  is  in  process  of  construction  a  brick  church  edi- 
fice, which  is  on  ground  donated  for  the  purpose  by 
A.  B.  Claypool,  who  is  one  of  the  trustees  and  is  su- 
perintending its  erection.  The  society  was  organized 
in  the  fall  of  1883  by  Rev.  J.  S.  Tevis,  pastor  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church  of  this  city.  The  mem- 
bership consisted  of  some  twelve  or  fifteen  persons  who 
held  membership  in  the  city  church,  to  which  the 
charge  is  as  yet  connected,  but  will  soon  become  an 
independent  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  The  vil- 
lage is  supplied  with  one  store.

HARRISON  TOWNSHIP. 

BOUNDARIES,    ORGANIZATION   AND    DESCRIPTION— LAND  ENTRIES— PIONEERS    AND    PIONEER  SETTLEMENT— INDE- 
PENDENCE DAY,  ly29—INDUSTRIES— SCHOOLS— CHURCHES— HALF-CENTURY  CITIZENS. 


THE  subdivision  bearing  the  above  name  is  bounded 
on  the  north  by  Wayne  County  and  Posey  Town- 
ship, on  the  west  by  Fairview  Township,  on  the  south 
by  Connersville  Township,  and  on  the  east  by  the 
West  Fork  of  Whitewater  River.  It  is  one  of  the 
original  townships  into  which  the  county  was  divided 
on  its  organization  in  1819,  and  was  then  described 
as  follows:  "Beginning  at  the  southeast  corner  of 
Section  17  in  Township  14,  Range  13;  thence  west  to 
the  western  extremity  of  the  county,  thence  north 
along  the  west  line  of  said  county  to  the  line  dividing 
the  counties  of  Wayne  and  Fayette;  thence  east  to 
the  boundary;  thence  south  to  the  northeast  corner  of 
Section  33,  Township  15,  Range  12;  thence  east  to 
the  northeast  corner  of  Section  32,  Township  15, 
Range  13;  thence  south  to  the  place  of  beginning." 

Harrison  as  then  described,  in  addition  to  its  pres- 
ent territory,  included  the  entire  township  of  Posey, 
the  northern  two-thirds  of  Fairview,  and  so  much  of 
Waterloo  as  lies  west  of  a  line  parallel  with  the  east- 
ern boundary  of  Connersville  Township.  It  lost  its 
territory  lying  east  of  the  river  on  the  formation  of 
Waterloo  Township  in  1821;  it  was  lessened  to  the 
extent  of  Posey  Township  on  the  formation  of  the 
latter  in  1823,  and  was  still  further  lessened  twelve 
sections  on  the  formation  of  the  township  of  Fair- 
view  in  1851. 

Its  surface  is  undulating  and  well  adapted  for 
agricultural  purposes,  having  good  natural  drainage, 
and  the  greater  portion  being  well  watered  by  springs 
and  streams,  the  larger  of  which  are  West  Fork,  Big 


and  Little  Williams  Creeks,  and  Lick  Creek.  At  the 
last  appraisement  the  lands  were  rated  for  taxation  at 
$38  per  acre  without  and  141  with  improvements. 
The  people  are  industrious  and  given  almost  entirely 
to  agricultural  pursuits,  there  being  one  notable  indus- 
try, a  tile  factory,  in  the  township.  For  several  years 
past  some  special  attention  has  been  given  to  the 
manufacture  of  butter  and  cheese,  there  having  been 
established  two  dairies  of  probably  less  than  100 
cows  each,  the  proprietors  of  which  are  Enoch  Cald- 
well and  Warner  Broaddus.  The  eastern  part  of  the 
township  is  crossed  north  and  south  by  the  White, 
water  Valley,  and  Fort  Wayne,  Cincinnati  &amp;  Louisville 
Railroads,  and  the  citizens  of  that  locality  have,  too, 
the  advantage  of  the  Hydraulic,  which  runs  parallel 
with  the  railroads. 


LAND    ENTRIES. 


With  the  exception  of  about  five  sections  of  land 
on  its  western  border,  the  township  lies  within  the 
"Twelve  Mile  Purchase,"  and  was  sold  as  set  forth 
below: 

Township  15  north.  Range  12  east. 

Southeast  quarter  of  Section  83,  October  22,

Many  of  the  original  purchasers  of  the  lands  of 
Harrison  became  actual  settlers,  improved  the  lands, 


played  their  part  in  transforming  the  wilderness  in- 
to beautiful  and  fertile  fields  amid  the  privations  and 
hardships  of  pioneer  life,  replaced  the  cabin  with  a 
substantial  brick,  the  cumbersome  log-stable  with  the 
commodious  baru,  gave  up  the  sickle,  the  scythe  and 
the  cradle  for  the  reaper  and  the  mower,  the  "flail" 
for  the  steam-thresher,  saw  the  wigwam  of  the  sav- 
age give  way  to  the  church,  witnessed  generations 
born  to  know  only  by  tradition  the  block-house,  the 
trail  of  the  Indian,  and  the  wild  animals,  gave  shape 
to  the  civil,  political  and  religioushistory  of  the  coun- 
ty, and  at  last,  their  bodies  to  the  churchyard. 
Peace  to  their  ashes. 

A  number  of  the  Caldwells  emigrated  from  North 
Carolina  in  the  early  history  of  the  West  and  settled 
in  Preble  County,  Ohio,  near  the  little  village  of 
Fairhaven,  and  in  1811,  removed  to  what  is  now  this 
township.  Among  the  brothers  were  Joseph,  James, 
Train,  and  perhaps,  John.  All  settled  on  land  above 
designated  and  Joseph  built  a  cabin  on  Christmas 
Day.  Their  families  were  subsequently  removed  to 
their  posse.ssions,  but  the  alarming  state  of  affairs 
on  the  approach  of  the  war  of  1812  induced  them  to 
return  to  Ohio,  and  in  1814  they  again  came  to  their 
possessions.  For  protection  a  block-house  was  built 
which  was  picketed  in  by  an  outer  fence  after  the 
usual  style  to  which  they  all  resorted  for  fear  of  an 
attack.  It  stood  on  what  is  now  the  W.  H.  Florea 
farm,  in  Section  34.  Joseph  was  a  native  of  North 
Carolina  and  died  in  the  year  1850.  John  died  in 
1872— was  born  in  Guilford  County,  N.  C,  in  1798. 
Train  was  one  of  the  first  Associate  Judges  of  the 
county  on  its  organization.  A  number  of  their  de- 
scendants are  still  residents  of  the  county. 

William  Webb,  Sr.,  died  in  the  county  in  1863, 
in  the  eighty-fifth  year  of  his  age.  He  was  born  in 
Virginia  and  in  his  infancy  with  parents  removed  to 
Kentucky,  and  in  1806  to  Indiana  Territory.  He  was 
a  soldier  in  the  war  of  1812,  removed  to  what  subse- 
quently became  the  county  of  Fayette  in  1813,  and 
was  one  of  the  members  in  the  constitution  of  the 
First  Regular  Baptist  Church  of  the  county. 

Alexander  Kerr,  from  Ohio,  settled  in  the  town- 
ship early. 

About  the  year  1812  Patrick  McCarty  and  John 
C.  Smith,  a  son-in-law,  settled  in  the  township.  They 
had  previously  emigrated  from  one  of  the  Carolinas 
and  settled  in  Franklin  County.  Mr.  Smith  was  a 
soldier  of  the  war  of  1812.  His  son  William  M., 
long  identified  with  the  history  of  the  county,  having 
served  the  people  in  various  official  positions,  was  born 
in  a  block-house  some  miles  west  of  Brookville  in  the 
fall  of  1812.  His  grandfather  was  a  Revolutionary 
soldier,  and  the  grandson,  though  in  advanced  life, 
served  in  the  late  war  of  the  Rebellion.

HISTORY    OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


John  Tyner  and  wife  Fannie,  from  North  Car- 
olina, immigrated  to  Fraaklin  County,  and  in  1813 
to  what  became  Fayette.  Mr.  Tyner  became  one  of 
the  first  of  the  Board  of  County  Commissioners,  and 
died  while  so  serving  in  1822. 

The  Kolbs  were  from  Georgia;  Tihlman  settled  in 
the  township  in  1811,  and  died  in  1845.  Francis 
Grofif,  from  Warren  County,  N.  J.,  came  to  the  White- 
water country  about  the  year  1813,  and  became  a  res- 
ident of  the  township. 

William  McCarty  settled  early.  He  was  one  of  the 
chain-carriers  of  the  surveying  party  which  in  1817 
were  engaged  in  surveying  the  lands  of  the  "  New 
Purchase." 

Joseph  and  Alexander  Dale,  emigrating  from 
Woodford  County,  Ky.,  settled  in  the  township  in 
1815.  Mrs.  Eliza  Florea,  daughter  of  Joseph  Dale, 
widow  of  Lewis  C.  and  mother  of  the  Florea  Bros., 
attorneys  at  law  in  Connersville,  was  born  in  the 
township  in  1815.  She  remembers  that  in  1822 
some  300  Indians  came  to  the  forest  surrounding  her 
father's  home.  Her  father  traded  a  great  deal  with 
the  Indians.  These  Indians  in  question  came  or 
stopped  to  trade.  They  had  different  kinds  of  wild 
game,  deer  and  bear  meat,  turkeys,  etc.  They  rode 
ponies  with  husk  saddles.  The  eldest  brother  of 
Mrs.  Florea  was  when  a  babe  stolen  by  the  Indians, 
but  rescued  by  the  father  before  a  mile  from  the 
cabin. 

In  1815  a  little  colony  left  the  vicinity  of  Bangor, 
Me.,  and  settled  temporarily  at  Columbia,  near  Cin- 
cinnati, Ohio.  Daniel  Campbell,  John  Savage  and 
Jacob  Nelson,  all  related,  and  Henry  Welch  com- 
posed the  colony.  Mr.  Savage,  in  the  fall  of  1815, 
died  at  Columbia,  and  his  wife  and  family,  with  the 
others  mentioned,  in  the  February  following  settled 
in  what  afterward  became  this  township.  Mrs.  Sav- 
age was  the  mother  of  the  venerable  John  Savage,  of 
Connersville. 

The  Widow  Savage  subsequently  married  John 
Adams,  and  in  1822  removed  to  what  is  now  the  Ben- 
jamin Thomas  farm,  situated  in  the  southeastern 
part  of  the  township.  The  brick  house  on  that  farm 
was  erected  for  Mr.  Adams  in  1822,  and  is  thought 
by  Mr.  Savage  to  have  been  the  first  brick  house  built 
in  the  township.  The  brick  work  was  done  by 
Nathaniel  Leonard,  and  the  carpenter  work  by  Zach- 
ariah  Parish. 

The  Dickeys,  James,  Robert  and  William,  settled 
here  as  early  as  1815. 

Samuel  and  Isaac  Dehaven,  natives  of  Kentucky, 
immigrated  to  this  county  and  settled  in  Harrison 
Township  in  about  1816.  Isaac  was  in  the  war  of 
1812.  Samuel  Dehaven,  Sr.,  who  entered  the  land, 
was  a  native  of  Pennsylvania. 


The  widow  of  Joseph  B.  Shipley  and  mother  of 
Samuel  J.  of  this  township  settled  in  the  county  in 
1819,  bringing  with  her  several  children  from  the 
State  of  Delaware. 

Samuel  B.  Ludlow,  of  New  York  State,  in  1819 
walked  to  the  county  of  Fayette;  subsequently 
entered  land  at  the  land  office  at  Brookville,  and  in 
1821  settled  upon  it. 

William  Monteith,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania, 
located  in  the  township  about  the  year  1818. 

John  Murphy,  a  native  of  Ireland,  settled  here  in 
1819.     He  came  from  the  vicinity  of  Cincinnati, Ohio. 

Jame.4  C.  Rea,  a  native  of  Rockbridge  County, 
Va.,  located  in  the  township  in  1818,  and  played  a 
conspicuous  part  in  the  affairs  of  the  county,  having 
been  Justice  of  the  Peace  for  nearly  a  quarter  of  a 
century,  besides  tilling  other  official  positions.  He 
was  a  soldier  in  the  war  of  1812,  and  subsequently 
Ensign  and  Lieutenant  in  1816  and  1818  in  the  State 
Militia  of  Virginia,  and  later  Colonel  in  the  Indiana 
State  Militia. 

John  Groendyke,  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  when 
young  went  to  Long  Island,  N.  Y.,  and  in  1812  to 
Butler  County,  Ohio,  and  in  1814  to  Dearborn  County 
this  State,  thence  into  the  subdivision  under  consid- 
eration about  1819. 

From  about  1819  to  1822  a  number  of  families 
coming  from  the  New  England  States  settled  mostly 
in  the  "New  Purchase"  in  the  western  part  of  the 
township,  and  founded  what  was  called  Yankeetown, 
which  name  it  has  since  retained.  Among  these 
were  Elder  Minor  Thomas,  Joshua  Wightsman, 
Elder  Minor  Meeker,  Eleazer  Carver,  Francis  Ellin- 
wood,  Collen  Smith,  Stephen  Ellis,  and  perhaps 
others. 

Elders  Minor  Thomas  and  Minor  Meeker  were 
ministers  in  the  Regular  Baptist  Church,  and  with 
their  families  emigrated  from  New  York  to  the  lands 
elsewhere  designated,  in  1819.  William  W.  Thomas, 
a  son,  was  long  and  favorably  known  to  the  citizens  of 
the  county.  His  earlier  years  were  passed  in  school- 
teaching,  but  after  the  close  of  that  avocation  he  was 
through  a  long  life  closely  and  prominently  connected 
with  the  farming  interests  of  his  township. 

Minor  Meeker,  Jr.,  a  son  of  the  Elder  and  father  of 
C.  C.  Meeker,  of  Harrison  Township,  served  his  coun- 
try in  the  war  of  1812,  and  represented  this  county 
several  times  in  both  branches  of  the  Legislature. 
His  death  occurred  in  1865. 

Moses  Ellis,  of  the  above-mentioned  family  from 
New  York,  emigrated  to  North  Bend,  Ohio,  in  1818 
and  eight  years  later  settled  in  this  township.  He 
was  made  the  tirst  Postmaster  of  that  settlement,  com- 
missioned November  28,  1827.  The  name  of  the 
Yankeetown  office  was  Plumb  Orchard. 


HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


177 


One  of  the  Wightsmans — Elias  R. — subsequently 
removed  to  Texas,  and  there  surveyed  and  laid  out  the 
city  of  Galveston. 

John  Thomas,  the  father  of  Benjamin  Thomas, 
coming  from  New  York  settled  here  in  1822,  having 
stopped  several  years  in  Ohio. 

The  Trowbridges,  from  New  York,  settled  here  in 
1822.     Levi  was  a  Major  in  the  war  of  1812. 

Thomas  Shipley,  a  native  of  Maryland  and  soldier 
of  the  war  of  1812,  settled  here  in  1821. 

In  1820  David  Gordon,  a  North  Carolinian,  and 
Jesse  Ferguson,  of  Kentucky,  effected  a  settlement  in 
the  township. 

Among  those  arriving  in  Harrison  in  1822  and 
1823  were  Capt.  Robert  Broaddus,  a  Virginian,  and 
Lewis  Robinson,  from  New  York,  respectively. 

Not  far  from  this  time  came  Zenas  Powell  from 
Kentucky,  and  David  Wolf  from  the  same  State,  the 
latter  being  a  native  of  Maryland,  but  removed  to 
Kentucky  in  the  beginning  of  this  century. 

In  1825  settled  Jonathan  Clifford  from  Vermont, 
Joseph  Taylor  from  the  State  of  New  York,  though  a 
native  of  Massachusetts,  and  Jesse  Shaw  from  Guil- 
ford County,  N.  C.  Mr.  Shaw  served  in  the  war  of 
181 2,  was  for  a  period  the  miller  at  the  old  Goodlander 
mill  and  in  1853  removed  to  Wabash  County,  this 
State,  where  he  died  in  1884,  aged  eighty-seven  years. 

INDEPENDENCE    DAY,    1829. 

Independence  Day,  1829,  was  observed  by  the  cit- 
izens of  the  county  by  a  celebration  held  on  the  farm 
of  Col.  J.  C.  Rea,  near  the  "cross-roads."  The  orator 
of  the  day  was  Samuel  W.  Parker;  reader  of  the 
Declaration  of  Independence,  Caleb  B.  Smith;  Col. 
William  Caldwell,  Marshall,  and  Thomas  J.  Sample, 
Assistant;  Adam  Banks,  Chaplain.  The  music  was 
under  the  direction  of  Ephraim  Clifford  and  John 
Sample,  Jr.  There  was  a  large  assembly  present  and 
after  the  formal  exercises  of  the  day  were  over  some 
400  ladies  and  600  gentlemen  were  dined,  and  at  the 
tables  a  number  of  toasts  were  drank.  Good  music 
was  furnished  and  the  occasion  was  livened  with  the 
discharge  of  artillery. 

INDUSTEIES. 

The  first  grist-mill  in  the  township  was  the  Jacob 
Goodlander  mill,  located  in  Section  7,  Township  14 
north.  Range  13  east,  on  the  west  fork  of  Whitewater 
River.  It  was  built  prior  to  1823.  For  a  number  of 
years  Thomas  Campbell  was  the  miller.  This  mill 
was  patronized  extensively,  persons  coming  to  it  from 
miles  distant.  There  has  been  no  grinding  here  for 
upward  of  thirty  years. 

A  little  more  than  two  miles  above  this  mill,  on 
the  river,  opposite  Waterloo,  was  the  Troxell  saw  and 


grist-mill,  which  was  built  probably  forty-five  years 
ago  by  Jacob  Troxell.  This  mill  also  ceased  opera- 
tions a  number  of  years  ago. 

In  1819,  on  Lick  Creek,  there  stood  a  saw-mill  in 
Section  34,  which  was  probably  the  first  built  in  the 
township.  Several  years  later  it  became  the  property 
of  Minor  Meeker,  Sr.,  and  later  passed  into  the  hands 
of  Lewis  Florea  and  continued  in  the  Florea  name 
until  operations  ceased.      The  frame  is  yet  standing. 

On  the  same  stream,  probably  a  mile  below,  was 
the  Capt.  Broaddus  saw-mill,  built  about  1839. 

In  an  early  day  the  eastern  part  of  the  township 
was  well  supplied  with  mills,  there  being  six  on 
Williams  Creek  and  all  within  an  area  of  four  miles. 
The  first  of  these  was  built  by  one  of  the  Kings  in 
Section  6.  It  was  a  grist-mill  and  ground  corn  only. 
Some  years  subsequent  to  the  erection  of  this  mill, 
which  was  not  far  from  1825,  a  factory  for  the  man- 
ufacture of  wooden  bowls  was  attached  and  run  by 
Anson  King  and  Joshua  Wightsman. 

Another  of  these  mills  was  for  grinding  both 
wheat  and  corn.  It  stood  in  the  extreme  southwest- 
ern part  of  the  township  and  was  built  by  Thomas 
Moffett  probably  fifty  years  ago.  The  other  four  were 
saw-mills,  the  oldest  of  which  was  located  in  Section 
6,  built  by  Levi  Trowbridge  not  far  from  1830.  A 
little  later  was  built  another  by  Moses  Ellis.  It  was 
located  in  Section  31,  and  passed  into  the  hands  of  a 
son  Lewis,  who  replaced  the  old  mill  by  a  large  and 
commodious  one,  in  which  was  a  turning-lathe  and 
machinery  for  the  manufacture  of  shingles  and  lath. 
The  mill  was  finally  removed  by  Mr.  Ellis  to  Benton- 
ville,  where  steam  became  the  motive  power.  It  is 
now  in  operation  at  that  point.  Some  few  years  sub- 
sequent to  the  building  of  the  Ellis  mill,  the  third  of 
the  four  saw-mills  was  built  in  the  northern  part  of 
Section  31,  by  John  Finney.  The  fourth  stood  in 
Section  7  and  was  built  by  John  Campbell  not  far 
from  1842.  This  mill  is  still  in  existence,  but  has 
not  been  in  operation  for  several  years.  There  are  at 
this  writing  no  grist  or  permanent  saw- mills  in  the 
township. 

Minor  Meeker,  Jr.,  carried  on  a  tan-yard  on  his 
farm  probably  a  half  century  ago,  and  a  decade  earlier 
Joseph  Dale  was  operating  a  copper  still  on  his  land. 
Just  north  of  what  is  known  as  the  B.  Thomas  farm, 
a  copper  still  was  operated  by  Tharpe  &amp;  Gordon, 
prior  to  1839.  A  carding-machine  was  built  on  the 
branch  on  the  D.  Bale  farm,  by  one  Stockdale,  about 
the  year  1837. 

Located  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  township 
are  extensive  tile  works,  which  have  been  in  opera- 
tion for  quite  a  period  of  years,  carried  on  for  some 
time  by  Ellis  &amp;  Williams,  and  subsequently  by  John 
Payne,  the  present  Auditor  of  the  county. 


178 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Among  the  early  merchants  at  Harrisburg  were 
Nathaniel  McGlure  and  Lyman  Thomas.  The  firm 
of  Lackey  &amp;  McCliire  were  granted  license  by  the 
County  Commissioners  as  merchants  in  the  county,  in 
July,  1827,  for  the  period  of  one  year,  for  which  they 
paid  112. 50.  In  August,  1828,  the  firm  was  McClure 
&amp;  Dickson,  and  in  1829  Nathaniel  McCluro  &amp;  John 
Murphy.  Lyman  Thomas  was  licensed  to  keep  a 
grocery  and  spirituous  liquors  at  the  "  Cross-roads  in 
Harrison  Township"  in  1828,  which  was  renewed  the 
following  year. 

SCHOOLS. 

Probably  as  early  as  1818,  or  thereabouts,  there 
stood  a  log  schoolhouse  on  the  possessions  of  John 
Tyner,  near  where  the  lands  of  Mr.  Tyner  and  those 
of  some  of  the  Caldwells  cornered,  in  which  school 
was  held  by  William  McKemmy,  who  is  believed  to 
have  taught  several  consecutive  terms  in  this  building. 
It  is  thought  that  Manlove  Caldwell  and  a  man  by 
the  name  of  Banks  taught  later  in  this  building  or 
neighborhood.  Mr.  Train  Caldwell,  born  in  1810, 
went  to  the  Tyner  schoolhouse  to  his  first  school. 

On  the  old  Williams  farm  in  the  northeast  quarter 
of  Section  6  was  built  one  of  the  early  log  school- 
houses.  It  is  remembered  to  have  been  standing 
there  in  1822.  The  following  year  a  summer  school 
was  taught  by  Myriam  Swisher.  William  W.  Thomas 
taught  here  early  and  possibly  was  the  first  teacher  in 
the  building. 

About  the  year  1823,  or  perhaps  a  little  later,  a 
log  schoolhouse  was  built  in  the  southern  part  of 
Section  12,  or  the  northern  part  of  Section  13.  Early 
teachers  in  this  house  were  William  Nelson,  a  Mr. 
Clark  and  Lunsford  Broaddus.  The  nest  house  for 
this  neighborhood  was  built  one  mile  north. 

Some  years  subsequent  to  the  Tyner  house,  a 
schoolhouse  was  erected  at  Harrisburg,  in  which 
Nelson  Penwell  and  William  Thomas  are  remembered 
as  having  kept  school. 

Another  of  the  early  built  schoolhouses  in  the 
northwestern  part  of  the  township  stood  on  the  pres- 
ent site  of  the  Second  Williams  Creek  Baptist 
Church,  just  across  the  road  from  the  house  hereto- 
fore mentioned  on  the  Williams  land.  In  about  1837 
Isaac  Scarce  was  teaching  here.  Other  teachers  in  this 
building  were  Jasper  Davis  and  Harriet  Thomas. 
The  following  is  a  sample  of  a  "  reward  of  merit "  of 
nearly  sixty  years  ago,  and  was  given  in  one  or  the 
other  of  these  houses  at  this  point: 

"This  may  certify  that  R.   Shipley  is  a  good  boy  and 
merits  the  praise  of  his  teacher. 
April  18,  1828,  Sally  Trowbridge. 

Soon  after  1838  a  schoolhouse  was  built  about 
one  and  a  half  miles  north  of  the  one  at  Second 
Williams  Greek  Church,  and   another   about  half  a 


mile  south  of  the  church.  Among  those  teaching  in 
the  north  house  were  Harriet  Thomas,  Ann  Ellis, 
Hiram  Dale,  C.  M.  Stone  and  Edwin  Trowbridge. 

There  are  now  in  the  township  six  schoolhouses,  as 
follows:  one  at  Yankeetown;  one  at  Harrisburg;  one 
two  miles  east  of  Harrisburg;  the  Hankins  school- 
house;  the  Gossipville  schoolhouse,  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  township;  Elephant  College,  on  the 
Henry  Mygat  farm;  the  Wilderness,  about  one  mile 
south  of  Harrisburg,  and  the  Schrador,  about  two 
miles  south  of  Yankeetown. 

CHURCHES. 

Regular  Baptist  Church  at  Lick  Creek.  (1814-46.) — 
In  the  years  1813  and  1814  a  number  of  members  of  the 
Baptist  Church  removed  from  the  lower  part  of  the 
Whitewater  Valley,  chiefly  from  the  bounds  of  Little 
Cedar  Grove  Church  in  Franklin  County,  and  situ- 
ated on  the  West  Fork  of  the  Whitewater  River. 
They  had  letters  of  dismissal,  and  on  the  14th  of 
May,  1814,  there  met  at  the  house  of  James  Tyner 
the  following-named  nineteen  persons,  and  were  there 
constituted  .into  a  church  by  the  name  of  Baptist 
Church  of  Jesus  Christ,  on  Lick  Creek:  John  Tyner, 
Forest  Webb,  James  Tyner,  Thomas  Carter,  Richard 
Kolb,  William  Webb,  John  Gilliam,  Jehu  Perkins, 
William  Henderson,  Jesse  Webb,  Robert  Atkinson, 
Fannie  Tyner,  Katie  Webb,  Nancy  Carter,  Nancy 
Webb,  Elizabeth  Perkins,  Lear  Webb,  Martha  Hen- 
derson and  Rebecca  Anderson. 

In  the  following  June  a  committee  was  appointed 
to  look  out  for  a  site  for  a  church  building;  and  sub- 
sequently the  land  of  Forest  Webb,  Jr.,  was  chosen. 
That  spring  one  pole  and  forty  perches  of  land  were 
purchased  of  that  gentleman  at  a  cost  of  $6,  and  in 
the  following  December  there  were  added  to  it  three 
poles  and  fifty-two  perches  which  were  purchased  of 
the  same  man,  and  for  which  $20  was  paid.  On  this 
latter  land  it  was  agreed  in  the  spring  of  1816  to 
build  a  meeting-house  to  bo  thirty  feet  square  and 
have  a  gallery.  Lewis  Johnson  and  James  and  Rich- 
ard Tyner  were  appointed  to  superintend  the  building 
of  it.  This  church  we  learn  was  constructed  of  logs 
and  stood  near  where  the  present  one  at  the  graveyard 
now  stands,  and  was  occupied  as  a  house  of  worship 
until  the  year  1833,  when  a  brick  meeting-house 
35x55  feet  was  erected.  Enoch  Applegate,  John  Mil- 
ieu, William  W.  Thomas,  Alexander  Dale  and  Will- 
iam Helm  were  appointed  to  superintend  its  erection. 
This  building  stood  until  1882,  when  it  was  replaced 
by  the  present  neat  and  commodious  frame. 

Forest  Webb  and  John  Tyner  were  chosen 
Deacons  of  the  church  early  in  1814.  For  a  time  in 
the  beginning,  the  church,  we  judge  from  the  rec- 
ords, was  served  by  visiting  Elders,  as  appear  in  the

minutes  the  names  of  Elders  James  Smith  and 
Stephen  Oldham  as  Moderators  (both  then  of  other 
churches).  Later  Moderators  of  that  early  period 
were  Forest  Webb,  John  Caldwell,  John  Tyner, 
Isaac  Martin,  Lewis  Johnson,  Elder  William  Miller 
and  Elder  Thomas. 

Elder  William  Miller  it  seems  was  ordained  aa 
their  minister  June  3,  1820,  and  at  this  time  appears 
the  name  of  Elder  William  Thomas.  These  men  were 
both  early  pastors  of  the  church.  Later,  along  in 
1830-31-32,  appear  the  names  of  Elder  John  Sparks, 
Elders  Stephen  Oldham,  Joseph  Martin  and  Wilson 
Thompson,  the  latter  serving  the  church  for  a  number 
of  years  beginning  early  in  1835. 

The  church  on  Lick  Creek  flourished  and  became 
one  of  the  strong  churches  of  the  Whitewater  Asso- 
ciation, but  dissensions  and  controversies  on  points  of 
doctrine  and  discipline  finally  arose,  which  terminat- 
ed in  a  division  of  the  church,  occurring  in  1846,  at 
which  time  the  church  numbered  120  members. 

Out  of  this  division  grew  two  churches,  which  to- 
day are  numbered  among  the  living  religious  socie- 
ties of  the  county.  The  division  was  not  simply  local, 
but  extended  beyond  county  and  even  Association 
limits,  and  affected  many  of  the  Old  School  Baptist 
Churches  of  this  entire  region  of  the  country.  Both 
divisions  or  branches  of  the  Lick  Creek  Church  re- 
tained the  name  of  the  original  church  and  each 
claims,  we  believe,  to  be  the  old  organization.  The 
same  can  be  said  of  the  Associations  to  which  each 
belongs.  It  is  not  our  purpose  to  set  forth  the  claims 
of  either,  but  to  simply  give  an  outline  sketch  of  each. 
The  two  churches  bearing  the  same  name  have  been 
generally  styled  in  order  to  designate  one  from  the 
other,  Means  and  Anti-means,  although,  we  believe, 
the  church  to  which  has  been  given  the  name  of 
Means  does  not  countenance  the  appellation,  hence  as 
a  matter  of  distinction  we  will  style  them  North  and 
South,  in  accordance  with  the  relative  positions  they 
occupy  to  those  cardinal  points  (South  Church,  Anti- 
means). 

In  February,  1816,  Forest  Webb,  Jacob  Young- 
blood  and  James  Tyner,  of  the  Lick  Creek  member- 
ship, were  chosen  to  select  a  place  for  a  burying- 
ground  and  the  result  was  the  origin  of  the  old  grave- 
yard at  the  Lick  Creek  Church.  Among  the  aged 
people  whose  remains  rest  by  the  old  church  and 
whose  graves  are  marked  by  legible  tombstones  are 
the  following-named:  John  Tyner,  died  in  1822,  aged 
forty-five  years;  James  Tyner,  died  in  1823,  aged 
forty-seven  years;  Margaret  Tyner,  his  wife,  died  in 
1838,  aged  sixty-two  years;  Nancy  Stephens,  died  in 
1835,  aged  eighty-one  years;  Elizabeth  Denman,  died 
in  1842,  aged  eighty-four  years;  Mehitablo  Kolb,  died 
1848,  aged  seventy-three  years;  Abigail  Trowbridge, 


born  in  1783,  died  in  1839;  John  Murphy,  born  in 
1784,  died  in  1835;  Doctor  Ball,  died  in  1856,  aged 
sixty  seven  years;  Rachel  Ball,  died  in  1870,  aged 
seventy-nine  years;  Zenas  Powell,  died  in  1863,  aged 
eighty-seven  years;  Charity  Powell,  died  in  1857,  aged 
eighty-seven  years;  Mary  Caldwell,  died  in  1873,  aged 
eighty-two  years:  James  C.  Rea,  died  in  1876,  aged 
eighty-seven  years;  John  Steven,  died  in  1845,  aged 
seventy-eight  years;  Mary  Frazier,  died  in  1860,  aged 
seventy- nine  years;  Mary  Louderback,  died  in  1867, 
aged  eighty  years. 

Regular  Baptist  Church  of  Lick  Creek  (South  1846 
-84.) — This  branch  after  the  division  retained  the 
church  property  and  have  since  worshiped  at  the  old 
site,  until  1882  in  the  old  brick  meeting-house  at  the 
graveyard,  and  since  in  the  neat  frame  edifice  con- 
structed at  that  time.  The  regular  minister  of  the 
old  church  at  the  time  of  the  division  was  Elder  Wil- 
son Thompson,  who  remained  with  those  continuing 
worship  at  the  same  church.  The  membership  of  the 
Church  South,  or  the  number  remaining  at  the  old 
church  in  1846,  was  about  eighty-seven.  Elder 
Thompson's  successor  was  Elder  Harvey  Wright,  who 
has  served  the  church  as  regular  minister  the  greater 
portion  of  the  time  ever  since.  During  his  absence 
for  about  one  year  his  position  was  filled  by  Elder 
Jesse  Jackson. 

Elder  Thmpson  was  a  strong  man  both  in  the 
affairs  of  church  and  state.  He  was  a  native  of 
Kentucky,  born  in  Woodford  County,  August  17, 
1788.  His  father  was  a  pioneer  of  that  State 
when  the  forests  were  dense  and  inhabited  almost  en- 
tirely by  wild  beasts  and  savage  Indians.  Says 
Thompson:  "I  have  often  sat  spell-bound  while  hear- 
ing my  father  relate  the  many  dangers  and  hair- 
breadth escapes  of  his  border  life,  and  those  of  the 
Revolution."  Our  subject's  boyhood  was  consequent- 
ly passed  amid  the  thrilling  alarms  and  trying  priva- 
tions incident  to  border  warfare  and  pioneer  life.  He 
received  little  schooling  and  that  in  a  scattering  way, 
attending  the  cabin  schools  for  a  few  days  at  a  time 
only,  during  which  time  he  acquired  only  a  smatter- 
in?  of  the  common  branches.  When  he  commenced 
preaching  he  could  not  read  a  chapter  or  hymn  intel- 
ligently. He  early  manifested  great  interest  in  relig- 
ious matters  and  at  the  age  of  thirteen  years  was  con- 
verted. In  1810  he  was  licensed  to  preach  within  the 
bounds  of  the  'North  Bend  Association.  His  first 
sermon  was  preached  at  the  house  of  a  Mr.  Cowgill, 
who  lived  near  the  line  then  dividing  the  counties  of 
Boone  and  Campbell,  Ky.,  he  being  then  in  his  twen- 
ty second  year.  In  the  latter  part  of  the  year  1810 
he  settled  in  the  State  of  Missouri  and  was  there  en- 
gaged in  preaching  for  several  years.  In  the  spring 
of  1814  he  removed  to  Ohio  and  resided  near  Spring-

field,  now  Springdale,  Hamilton  County.  He  had 
during  the  winter  preached  for  the  Baptist  Churches 
at  Mill  Creek  and  Pleasant  Run  in  that  vicinity  in 
connection  with  Springfield,  which  churches  he  con- 
tinued to  attend  until  1819,  though  in  the  mean- 
time he  had  made  several  journeys,  preaching  through 
Ohio,  eastern  Indiana  and  Kentucky;  and  through 
Kentucky,  Tennessee  and  the  Mississippi  Territory. 
His  father  entered  a  quarter-section  of  land  on  In- 
dian Creek  in  the  Whitewater  country  in  1814,  and 
while  prospecting  in  that  region  was  accompanied  by 
the  son,  who  then  preached  his  first  sermon  in  Indi- 
ana. 

From  1819  to  1824  he  was  the  assistant  co-laborer 
with  Elder  Clark  at  the  Baptist  Church  in  Lebanon, 
Ohio.  In  1834  he  removed  to  Fayette  County,  Ind., 
and  early  in  1835  he  took  pastoral  care  of  the  Lick 
Creek  Church,  and  the  superintendence  of  the  Second 
Williams  Creek  Church.  He  served  the  former 
church  regularly  for  many  years  as  pastor,  and  when 
old  and  feeble  occasionally  preached  for  that  people 
until  his  death.  May  1,  1866. 

' '  Elder  Thompson  for  many  years  was  considered 
one  among  the  most  able  investigators  of  Scripture 
in  the  Regular  Baptist  Church.  He  engaged  in  pub- 
lic discussion  with  the  most  talented  mind,  the  most 
popular  denominations;  and  in  all  his  discussions^the 
public  judgment  accorded  to  him  great  success.  In 
public  debates  he  had,  connected  with  his  strong  rea- 
soning powers,  the  faculty  of  selecting  his  proof-texts 
directly  to  the  point,  depending  more  upon  the  mean- 
ing and  purport  of  the  texts  used  than  on  the  num- 
ber employed.  When  he  took  a  position  he  was  care- 
ful that  it  should  be  a  tenable  one;  and  after  taking 
a  position,  he  would  not  suffer  himself  to  be  driven 
or  enticed  away  from  it." 

After  removing  to  Indiana,  he  made  three  exten- 
sive tours  of  preaching,  one  in  which  he  traveled 
through  Ohio,  Kentucky,  Virginia,  Pennsylvania, 
New  York,  Delaware  and  New  Jersey;  another, 
through  Kentucky,  Virginia  and  North  Carolina.  The 
other  tour  was  through  the  State  of  Georgia. 

He  served  several  years  in  the  State  Legislature 
from  the  county  of  Fayette.  His  wife  was  Mary 
Gregg,  whom  he  married  in  Kentucky,  May  24,  1810. 

Regular  Baptist  Church  of  Lick  Creek  {North, 
1846-84). — Some  forty  of  the  old  Lick  Creek  Church 
membership,  prominent  among  whom  were  James 
Tyner,  William  W^ebb,  Alexander  Dale,  William  W. 
Thomas  and  Enoch  Applegate,  withdrew  therefrom 
in  the  spring  of  1846,  and  in  June  declared  them- 
selves the  Regular  Baptist  Church  of  Lick  Creek. 
Elder  John  Sparks  was  chosen  their  pastor.  In  1847, 
an  acre  and  a  half  of  land  lying  one-half  mile  north 
of  Harrisburg,  was  secured  of  John  Caldwell  and  B. 


S.  Trowbridge,  upon  which  was  erected  the  present 
frame  church  edifice  now  standing  on  that  site.  Alex- 
ander Dale,  William  W.Thomas,  and  James  Tyner  were 
the  first  Trustees  chosen.  In  March,  1848,  Elder  D.  H. 
Drummond  began  giving  the  church  a  portion  of  his 
time,  and  in  1854  Elder  George  Harlan  was  employed, 
and  in  1863  Elder  Erasmus  D.  Thomas'  name  appears 
as  one  of  the  Elders  of  this  church.  The  member- 
ship of  this  church  is  the  larger  of  the  Lick  Creek 
churches. 

Second  Regular  Baptist  Church  on  Williams 
Creek. — This  church  was  made  up  mainly  by  members 
formerly  belonging  to  the  Lick  Creek  Church,  and  was 
constituted  July  21,  1832,  representatives  being  pres- 
ent from  the  churches  of  Lick  Creek,  Franklin  and 
East  Fork  of  Flat  Rock.  The  original  membership 
was  as  follows:  Eleazer  Carver,  Grigg  M.  Thomp- 
son, Abigail  Trowbridge,  Mary  Johnston,  Anna  Draper, 
Harriet  Thomas,  Phcsbe  Thomas,  Schuyler  Jagger, 
D.  F.  Thomas,  Elizabeth  Stephens,  Benjamin  Ste- 
phens, Martha  Morphew,  W.  M.  Buck,  Ellen  F.  Buck, 
Elizabeth  Carver,  Phcebe  Jagger  and  Elizabeth  Rich 
(of  which  number  Grigg  M.  Thompson  is  the  only 
one  now  living). 

The  first  letter  of  the  church  and  messengers  were 
sent  to  the  W^hitewater  Association  July  21,  1833,  the 
letter  being  prepared  by  Grigg  M.  Thompson  and 
Nathan  Morphew.  The  following  August  the  church 
was  received  into  the  Assooiation'as  one  of  its  mem- 
bers. 

The  first  Clerk  of  the  church  was  Nathan  MorpheW) 
who  was  followed  by  G.  M.  Thompson.  For  several 
years  prior  to  the  building  of  a  meeting-house,  serv- 
ices were  held  at  the  schoolhouse  then  standing  on 
the  present  site  of  their  house  of  worship,  which'is 
of  frame,  and  was  built  in  1846.  The  Trustees  then 
chosen  were  Drury  Tyner,  Lewis  H.  Johnston  and  E. 
Carver. 

The  pastors  of  this  society  have  been  Elders  James 
Newhouse,  G.  M.  Thompson,  Wilson  Thompson,  and 
later,  John  Sparks,  David  Drummond,  William 
Sparks,  E.  D.  Thomas  and  Charles  Reed. 

Wiley  Chapel  {Methodist  Episcopal  Church). — This 
church,  located  at  the  graveyard  near  Williams  Creek, 
in  the  southwestern  part  of  the  township,  is  the  out- 
growth of  a  class  early  organized  at  the  house  of  a 
Mr.  Hawkins  in  that  vicinity.  In  1823  among  the 
members  were  the  Hawkinses,  the  Curtises,  Morrises 
and  Weltons.  The  charge,  on  the  organization  of  the 
Connersville  Circuit  in  1822,  was  placed  on  that  cir- 
cuit, and  it  has  since  remained  on  the  same  circuit 
and  circuits,  growing  out  of  the  old  Connersville  Cir- 
cuit (Columbia  and  Glenwood). 

In  about  the  year  1836  a  common  place  for  the 
worship  of  this  society  was  at  the  house  of  Thomas

MoflStt,  and  in  that  vicinity  about  this  period  was  a 
favorite  camp-meeting  ground.  Sabbath -school,  too, 
was  held  in  a  building  belonging  to  Mr.  Moffitt,  which 
had  previously  been  used  for  a  store.  Among  the 
members  of  the  chiu'ch  at  about  this  period  were 
Thomas  Moffitt  and  wife,  Robert  Fielding  and  wife, 
John  Hawkins  and  wife,  and  Mrs.  Mary  Campbell. 
The  frame  edifice  now  standing,  though  since  remod- 
eled, was  built  not  far  from  the  year  1844.  The 
ground  for  both  church  and  burial  purposes  was 
deeded  to  the  church  by  John  Hawkins. 

The  first  interment  made  in  the  graveyard  was  the 
body  of  Frances  M.  Moffitt,  who  died  March  10,  1845, 
aged  five  years. 

The  Christian  (Campbellite)  Church,  situated  just 
east  of  the  hamlet  of  Harrisburg,  is  the  outgrowth 
of  religious  meetings  held  at  private  houses  and  in 
the  schoolhouse  at  Harrisburg  some  years  before  the 
late  war,  though  perhaps  not  formally  organized  until 
in  1864.  It  has  been  stated  in  print  that  the  organiza- 
tion was  eifected  in  1864  by  Elder  W.  G.  Irvin,  with 
thirty-two  members.  Among  those  early  identified 
with  the  church  were  Warner  Broaddua  and  wife, 
Edwin  Wilson  and  wife,  Edward  Higham  and  wife, 
Thomas  Robinson  and  wife,  and  Warren  Drennen  and 
wife.  The  neat  and  substantial  church  edifice  in 
which  the  services  of  the  society  are  held  was  erected 
in  1871,  and  dedicated  that  fall  by  Elder  Daniel  Van 
Buskirk.

TENNINGS  is  one  of  the  original  five  townships 
^  into  which  the^couaty  was  divided  by  the  Com- 
missioners February  9,  1819,  when  its  boundaries 
were  described  as  follows:  "Beginning  at  the  south- 
west corner  of  Section  16,  Township  13,  Range  13; 
thence  north  to  the  northwest  corner  of  Section  21, 
Township  14,  Range  13;  thence  east  along  the 
line  dividing  Sections  21  and  16  to  the  boundary 
line;  thence  south  .along  said  boundary  to  the  south- 
east corner  of  fractional  Section  18;  thence  west  to 
the  place  of  beginning."  In  addition  to  its  present 
territory  the  towuship  then  included  more  than  one- 
third  of  the  present  township  of  Liberty,  and  more 
than  one  section  of  Harmony  Township  of  Union 
County.  This  it  lost  on  the  formation  of  Union 
County  in  1821. 


The  township  is  in  the  form  of  a  parallelopipedon 
and  has  for  its  northern  boundary  Waterloo  Town- 
ship, its  eastern  boundary  Union  County,  its  south- 
ern boundary  Jackson  Township,  and  its  western 
boundary  Connersville  and  Jackson  Townships.  It 
contains  eighteen  sections  or  11,520  acres  of  land, 
the  surface  of  which  is  rolling  and  of  excellent  pro- 
ductive quality.  The  streams  of  the  township  are 
Simpson  Creek,  Mud  Run,  Village  and  a  branch  of 
Eli's  Creek — all  small.  It  is  well  piked  and  the 
northern  portiou  is  crossed  by  the   C,  H.  &amp;  I.  R.  R.

EARLY  SETTLEMENT  AND  PIONEER  BIOGRAPHY. 

It  will  be  noticed  that  the  earliest  purchases  made 
were  in  1811  and  1812,  the  lands  lying  in  the  north- 
ern half  of  the  township,  excepting  one  in  Section  3, 
south  of  Alquina.  While  this  is  true  the  first  settle- 
ment effected  was  on  land  not  entered  until  1814. 
Thomas  Simpson,  Sr.,  wJio  is  credited  with  being  the 
first  to  settle  within  the  present  limits  of  the  sub- 
division, was  a  native  of  Maryland,  born  in  1778. 
He  subsequently  settled  in  North  Carolina,  where  he 
was  married  to  Sarah  Mabry  or  Marberry,  and  in 
after  years  removed  to  the  vicinity  of  Clinch  River,  in 
Tennessee.  About  the  year  1805  or  1806,  having  in 
view  the  purchase  of  land  in  the  Territory  of  Indiana, 
he  removed  to  the  vicinity  of  Harrison,  Ohio,  and 
was  there  awaiting  the  further  preparation  of  lands 
for  market.  Here  he  lived  several  years,  and  when 
one  Vantrees,  a  Government  Surveyor,  was  making 
up  the  party  for  the  survey  of  the  "  Twelve-Mile  Pur- 
chase," Simpson  joined  them  to  act  as  hunter  for  the 
party.  He  accompanied  them  and  remained  until  the 
survey  was  completed  (which  was  in  progress  in  1808 
-09),  traveling  and  hunting  over  the  country  from 
Michigan  to  the  Ohio  River.  On  the  approach  of 
winter  tho  party  built  a  log-cabin  by  a  spring  on  the 
northeast  quarter  of  Section  23  (Township  14,  Range 
13),  which  they  occupied  during  the  survey  of  that 
region  of  the  country. 

After  the  completion  of  the  survey,  and  in  Decem- 
ber,   1809,  Mr.  Simpson,   by  means  of  a  four-horse 


wagon,  moved  his  family,  consisting  of  wife  and  six 
children,  to  the  cabin,  and  on  that  site  passed  the 
remaining  years  of  his  life,  dying  February  5,  1848, 
in  the  seventy-sixth  year  of  his  age. 

To  Thomas  Simpson,  Sr.,  a  son,  still  residing  in 
sight  of  the  spot  where  the  old  cabin  stood,  around 
which  cluster  so  many  recollections  of  frontier  life, 
the  writer  is  indebted  for  the  above  data,  and  much 
other  contained  in  this  volume.  Mr.  Simpson  was 
born  in  Tennessee  in  the  year  1800  and  is  conse- 
quently past  four  score  years,  yet  is  well  preserved 
physically  and  retains  a  clear  memory.  In  1826  he 
married  Joanna  S.  White,  who  too  has  been  spared  to 
spend  the  evening  of  their  lives  together. 

In  the  vicinity  of  the  cabin,  probably  three-quar- 
ters of  a  mile  south  of  the  spring  in  that  early  day, 
was  a  camping- ground  for  the  Indians  which  they 
frequently  occupied  and  many  were  their  visits  to  the 
Simpson  dwelling,  where  they  were  always  fed,  which 
kindness  they  remembered  and  no  depredations  were 
committed  in  the  neighborhood.  Just  north  of  the 
creek,  which  by  the  way  was  known  by  the  Indians  as 
Brush  or  Brushy  Creek,  and  subsequently  designated 
by  the  pioneers  as  Simpsons'  Creek,  in  honor  of  the 
first  settler,  was  the  place  of  burial  of  the  Indians, 
and  on  the  arrival  of  the  Simpsons  was  still  used. 

Probably  the  major  portion  of  the  early  settlers  of 
Jennings  were  emigrants  from  the  South,  yet  some  of 
them  were  natives  of  the  North  and  East  but  had 
emigrated  thither  in  the  earlier  history  of  that  sec- 
tion. 

John  and  Stephen  Oldham,  brothers,  John  Keeney, 
James  Smith,  and  Samuel  Hill,  all  men  of  families, 
immigrated  to  the  Simpson  neighborhood  from  Ten- 
nessee about  1810  or  1811.  Smith  and  Oldham  were 
ministers  of  the  Regular  Baptist  Church.  These 
with  later  settlers  came  from  the  neighborhood  in 
Tennessee  in  which  the  Simpsons  had  resided  and 
communication  had  been  carried  on  between  them  and 
others  by  which  means  they  and  others  were  induced 
to  come. 

Jacob  Darter  and  family  settled  just  west  of 
Alquina  in  1813.  He  and  wife  Catharine  emigrated 
from  Vii-ginia  to  Campbell  County,  Tenn.,  in  1811, 
where  one  winter  was  passed  and  in  1812  they  re- 
moved to  the  old  Adam  Eli  place  on  East  Fork,  in 
what  is  now  Union  County,  where  the  husband  rented 
ground  and  raised  one  crop,  then  came  to  what  is  now 
Fayette  County.  They  are  believed  to  have  been  the 
first  family  that  settled  in  that  vicinity.  That  same 
season  Joseph  Vanmeter,  who  lived  on  the  William 
Louderback  place  and  John  Manley,  who  lived  on  the 
Joseph  Rutherford  place,  came  to  the  neighborhood; 
the  former  emigrating  from  Ohio.  About  this  time 
Isaac  and  James  Jones  settled  in  that  vicinity  and  it

is   believed    purchased    land    of   Joseph    Vanmeter. 

The  followincr  sketch  of  the  life  and  labors  of  one 
of  Jenning's  pioneers  appeared  in  the  Liberty  Herald 
of  September  9,  1875: 

"Adam  Pigman  was  born  August  18,  1789,  in 
Greene  County,  Penn.  At  one  year  of  age,  he  was 
taken  by  his  parents  to  Bracken  County,  Ky. ,  living 
some  time  in  Fort  Augusta,  Bracken  Station.  At  the 
age  of  four  years  his  parents  moved  to  Jessamine 
County,  where  he  grew  up  to  manhood,  spending  most 
of  the  time  working  at  the  carpenter's  trade.  When 
a  boy,  he  often  saw  those  old  pioneers  of  Kentucky, 
Boone  and  Kenton,  and  was  a  nephew  to  James  Har- 
rod,  who  built  the  first  cabin  on  the  historic  'dark 
and  bloody  ground.'  In  June,  1812,  he  enlisted  in 
the  army  under  Capt.  Dowden,  Col.  Togue's  regiment 
serving  as  Fourth  Sergeant  of  his  company,  and  in 
August  his  regiment  marched  for  the  seat  of  war.  He 
was  in  the  relief  sent  to  Fort  Wayne,  which  place 
they  entered  without  firing  a  gun;  then  marched  to 
the  support  of  Gen.  Winchester,  in  Ohio,  following 
the  defeated  British  and  Indians  under  Proctor  down 
the  Maumee  River  for  several  days  and  nights.  He 
was  then  detailed  to  help  build  Fort  Amanda,  on  the 
Auglaize  River,  and  was  afterward  in  the  relief  sent 
to  Gen.  Winchester,  then  at  Frenchtown,  on  the  River 
Raisin,  but  was  too  late  to  participate  in  that  bloody 
engagement  which  clothed  Kentucky  and  Ohio  in 
mourning.  His  command  then  marched  to  and 
helped  build  Fort  Meigs,  where,  after  considerable 
skirmishing,  and  enduring  many  hardships,  known 
only  to  frontier  life,  in  all  of  which  he  considered 
death  preferable  to  dishonor,  he  was  mustered  out, 
and  returned  with  a  number  of  comrades  to  the  home 
of  his  boyhood,  where  he  again  entered  the  service, 
this  time  as  Lieutenant  of  his  company. 

"  He   came   to    Indiana   Territory  in   December, 

1813,  and  entered  a  quarter- section  of  land  in  what  is 
now  Fayette  County,  and  in  the  summer  of  the  nest 
year,  in  company  with  the  Huff  family,  started  again 
for  the  far  West,  traveling  through  the  wilderness  on 
foot,  driving  stock  for  his  board.  They  arrived  at 
their  destination,  now  Rigor's  Mill,    in  September, 

1814,  and  the  first  morning  of  his  arrival  ho  shot 
nineteen  wild  turkeys.  His  first  work  in  the  now 
country  was  to  build  a  house  for  Huff,  hewing  the 
timber,  including  the  studding,  braces'  and  rafters. 
It  was  the  first  frame  house  built  within  the  limits  of 
Union  County,  and  the  present  residence  of  R.  T. 
Maize.  After  the  completion  of  the  job,  he  went  to 
Brookvillo — then  composed  of  a  few  small  cabins — 
and  worked  as  journey  carpenter  with  Tom  Coldscott, 
and  through  this  means  obtained  the  money  to  pay 
for  his  land.  He  was  married,  November  4,  1815, 
to  Mary,  daughter  of   Adam  Eli,  from  whom  Eli's 


Creek  derived  its  name.  December  14,  1815,  he  and 
his  wife  moved  on  land  in  Fayette  County,  and  on 
the  night  of  their  arrival  snow  fell  to  the  depth  of 
two  feet  and  six  inches,  and  lay  on  the  gi'ound  until 
the  next  spring;  yet  notwithstanding  this  and  the 
many  privations  incident  to  new  settlers,  by  the  mid- 
dle of  May  they  had  cleared  in  the  greenwood  sis 
acres,  and  planted  it  in  corn,  and  by  the  nest  spring 
they  had  cleared  twelve  acres  more,  part  of  which  they 
planted  in  fruit  trees,  being  the  first  planted  in  the 
Village  Creek  Valley.  For  nine  years  they  lived  here, 
sometimes  suffering  greatly  for  the  comforts  of  life, 
but  always  cheerful,  submitting  to  any  privation  or 
labor  that  fell  to  their  lot. 

"  Fields  were  to  be  cleared  in  the  green  timber, 
roads  to  be  cut  through  the  trackless  forest;  school- 
houses  were  to  be  built;  a  means  of  defense  was  to  be 
kept  organized,  in  all  of  which  he  contributed  his  full 
share  of  means  and  time,  serving  as  Captain  of  a  com- 
pany of  Territorial  Militia  for  several  years.  In 
March,  1824,  they  moved  to  their  present  residence, 
to  be  near  to  and  care  for  their  aged  parents.  They 
had  twelve  children,  ten  of  whom  have  already  gone 
over  the  dark  river,  leaving  them  but  two  in  their  old 
age — Luranah,  th&amp;  eldest,  and  Eli,  who  is  a  power  of 
strength  to  them  in  their  declining  years.  Adam  Pig- 
man,  now  eighty  six  years  old,  in  early  life  resolved 
to  abstain  from  the  use  of  whisky,  coffee  and  tobacco, 
and  has  strictly  adhered  to  that  resolution  from  that 
year  to  the  present  time. 

Mr.  Pigman  and  wife  celebrated,  November  4, 
1875,  the  sixtieth  anniversary  of  their  marriage. 
They  died,  the  former,  September  17,  and  the  latter 
September  23,  1876,  aged  eighty-seven  and  eighty 
years  respectively." 

Many  of  those  entering  land  settled  upon  it  at 
about  the  time  of  purchase,  or  in  some  cases  a  little 
later,  and  were  engaged  for  years  in  improving  the 
same,  while  a  few  never  settled  their  possessions,  but 
bought  for  others  or  for  speculation. 

Isaac  Fletcher  came  from  Ohio  pretty  early,  but 
did  not  remain  long.  His  laud  was  purchased  by 
William  Walker,  who  too  came  from  Ohio. 

Aaron  and  Jonathan  Haugham,  from  Kentucky, 
after  a  residence  of  some  years,  removed  further  West. 
The  Nobles,  Lewis,  Daniel  and  Joseph,  from  Ten- 
nessee, were  early  settlers,  but  subsequently  left  the 
county. 

William  Knott  was  from  South  Carolina. 

Michael  Brown  was  from  Lebanon  County,  Penn. 

In  1814  James  Newland,  from  Bracken  County, 
Ky.,  settled  in  the  township.  He  had,  in  1812, 
emigrated  from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania.  Reserved 
in  the  war  of  1812-15. 

Jesse  Pigman,  who  entered  land  here,  was  a  broth-

er  to  Adam  Pigman,  spoken  of  above.  The  Stod- 
dards  and  Kobinsons  were  from  Ohio,  and  related. 
They  resided  on  the  land  they  entered  for  a  j)eriod, 
then  removed  further  West,  to  the  Wabash  country. 

Geoi-ge,  the  father  of  John  C.  Death,  in  whose 
name  the  land  was  entered,  came  from  Ohio  here, 
and  subsequently  removed  to  Montgomery  County, 
this  State. 

The  Bells,  Samuel  and  Joseph,  from  Kentucky, 
settled  in  the  township  quite  early;  also  Stephen 
Goulding  and  the  Woods,  Jeremiah  and  John. 

Abraham  Lyons,  who  died  at  Lyons'  Station  in 
1880,  at  the  advanced  age  of  eighty  years,  was  a 
native  of  Virginia,  and  with  his  parents  removed  to 
Kentucky,  and  in  1808  settled  in  Indiana  Territory, 
and  about  the  year  1815  located  in  the  vicinity  of 
Alquina.      He  was  the  father  of  ten  children. 

The  Veatches,  Loudenbacks  and  Hutchinses  were 
among  the  pioneers  of  the  township. 

The  Rosses,  from  North  Carolina,  were  pioneers 
in  the  vicinity  of  Alquina.  The  Rutherfords  were 
from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania,  and  settled  in  Sec- 
tion 4,  on  a  tract  of  170  acres,  for  which,  in  1830, 
Joseph  paid  $800.  It  was  one  of  the  first  farms 
opened  up  in  the  township. 

Samuel  Riggs,  with  his  parents,  settled  early  in 
Washington  County,  Ohio,  coming  from  the  State  of 
Maryland.  In  1811  Samuel  walked  from  Washing- 
ton County  to  this  section  of  the  country,  selected 
and  entered  his  land,  and  in  1819,  with  family,  moved 
upon  it  and  there  passed  his  life. 

James  Worster,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  moved 
early  in  life  to  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  with  parents. 
In  1814,  with  family,  James  emigrated  to  what  lately 
became  Jennings  Township.  He  had  previously 
served  in  the  war  of  1812.  Subsequently  his  father, 
Robert,  settled  in  the  township,  and  was  among  the 
early  school  teachers  of  the  county.  He  is  said  to 
have  preached  the  first  Methodist  sermon  west  of  the 
Alleghenies. 

Amos  Miliner  settled  in  the  township  in  1819. 
He  was  a  Revolutiouary  soldier,  and  in  an  early  day 
emigrated  from  Pennsylvania  to  Bracken  County, 
Ky.  He  died  in  1851,  in  the  ninety-second  year  of 
his  age. 

William  Lair,  a  soldier  of  the  war  of  1812,  and 
son  of  a  Revolutionary  soldier,  a  native  of  Virginia, 
though  reared  in  Harrison  County,  Ky.,  some  time 
subsequent  to  the  last  war  with  England  immigrated 
to  what  is  now  this  township,  where  he  entered  land 
upon  which  he  lived  and  died.  Several  sons  and 
descendants  are  now  residents  of  this  county. 

David  Sutton,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  in  about 
1816  settled  in  the  township  on  land  where  now 
resides  his  son  A.  B.     David  entered  a  large  body  of 


land,  and  upon  a  portion  of  which  A.  B.  has 
resided  nearly  seventy  years.  David  stopped  for  a 
time  in  Warren  County,  Ohio. 

In  1819  William  Walker,  a  Virginian,  settled  in 
the  township.  He  had  previously  lived  for  a  time 
in  the  vicinity  of  Chillicothe,  Ohio.  He  served  in  the 
war  of  1812. 

The  widow  Garland  Stanley,  of  North  Carolina 
stock,  with  several  childi-en  immigrated  from  Campbell 
County,  Ky. ,  in  1822  to  Union  County,  this  State, 
and  in  1824  settled  in  this  township. 

In  1833  John  Jacob  Scholl  settled  in  the  town- 
ship. He  was  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  and  the 
father  of  Jacob,  Solomon  and  .George  Scholl,  of  this 
township.  Michael  Petro,  a  Virginian,  though  from 
Ohio  here,  located  in  the  township  in  1816. 

ALQUINA. 

The  origin  of  this  little  village  seems  lost  to  the 
few  pioneers  yet  living  in  its  vicinity.  Fifty  years 
ago  it  was  a  village  of  almost  its  present  size.  From 
tradition  it  is  learned  that  one  Green  Larimore  gave 
the  name  to  the  place.  He  was  one  of  the  early 
merchants  there,  and  made  some  pretensions  to  per- 
form cures  by  the  laying  on  of  hands,  and  other  simi- 
lar means.  The  village  occupies  ground  in  the 
northwestern  and  northeastern  parts  of  Sections  2 
and  3  respectively,  located  on  the  road  leading  from 
Connersville  to  Dunlapsville,  a  little  east  of  the  cen- 
ter of  the  township.  The  original  proprietor  of  this 
ground  was  Joseph  Vanmeter,  and  the  date  of  entry, 
1813. 

The  records  show  that  a  south  addition  to  the  vil- 
lage was  laid  ofi"  November  2,  1838,  by  Joseph  D. 
Ross  and  Isaac  Darter,  and  that  the  north  part  was 
laid  off  December  27,  1841,  by  Jacob  Reed;  surveyed 
by  William  Dickey. 

Among  the  early  merchants  of  the  village  were 
Samuel  N.  Harlan,  licensed  in  May,  1830;  H.  G. 
Larimore,  licensed  in  January,  1831  (which  was 
renewed  for  several  years);  Moses  Lyons,  licensed  in 
1836;  Joseph  D.  Ross,  licensed  in  1837  (in  January, 
1839,  Joseph  D.  Ross  was  Postmaster  at  this  point, 
and  the  store  was  in  the  hands  of  Joseph  D.  &amp;  Sam- 
uel K.  Ross,  who  were  successors  to  Moses  Lyons,  the 
latter  having  built  the  store  house);  David  Maze 
succeeded  Ross,  and  in  several  years  sold  to  John  H. 
Eyestone.  In  September,  1839,  license  was  granted 
to  S.  &amp;  T.  Jackson  to  vend  merchandise.  Subsequent 
firms  were  Eyestone  &amp;  Newland,  H.  H.  &amp;  Thomas 
Jackson,  and  Maze  &amp;  Jackson. 

A  Mr.  Mallery,  John  Cashner,  Joseph  Graham, 
Jacob  Davis,  Joseph  Pullen,  John  Sims  and  Aaron 
Goulding  have  been  among  the  earlier  blacksmiths  of 
the  village.

HISTORY  OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Not  far  from  1846  a  tan-yard  was  put  in  opera- 
tion by  John  H.  Eyestone  and  for  more  tlian  a  decade 
was  one  of  the  industries  of  the  place. 

Not  far  from  1841  George  P.  Lyons,  Samuel 
Branum,  William  Freely  and  a  fourth  party  erected 
a  steam  power  saw-mill,  which  was  operated  a  number 
of  years.  Having  changed  hands  several  times  was 
finally  destroyed  by  lire  when  owned  by  Price  &amp; 
Bros.  It  was  rebuilt  and  a  planing-mill  attached  for 
the  manufacture  of  sash  and  doors.  In  recent  years 
it  was  removed  to  another  location. 

The  census  of  1880  gave  Alquina  a  population  of 
125.  It  has  now  a  postoffice,  two  stores,  two  black- 
smith shops,  one  shoe  shop,  a  schoolhouse  and  one 
church. 

EAKLT    SCHOOLS. 

Among  the  early  schools  can  be  mentioned  the 
one  known  as  the  Jones  or  Darter  schoolhouse,  situ- 
ated about  half-way  between  those  farms,  and  located, 
perhaps,  a  mile  southwest  of  Alquina.  About  the 
year  1826  or  1827  school  was  taught  here  by  Baylis 
Jones.  Another  schoolhouse  of  about  this  period, 
known  as  the  Eyestone  school,  stood  probably  one 
mile  east  of  the  present  Mount  Garrison  meeting- 
house, or  two  miles  east  of  south  of  Alquina,  on  the 
Asbury  Hanson  farm.  Green  Larimore,  Mr.  Linn, 
Matthew  R.  Hull,  Washington  Curnutt  and  Thomas 
O' Brine  were  early  teachers  in  this  locality;  also  John 
P.  Brown.  Daddy  Wooster  is  thought,  too,  to  have 
taught  one  of  the  early  schools  in  the  southern  part 
of  Jennings  Township.  A  little  later  school  was 
kept  in  the  vicinity  of  Alquina  by  Squire  Harrison,  of 
Connersville,  and  by  a  Mr.  Barnard.  These  were  all 
subscription  schools,  and  the  buildings  constructed  of 
logs.  Gradually  the  schools  received  part  public 
money,  and  finally  came  improvement  in  the  build- 
ings, and  the  regular  school  districts  supported 
entirely  by  public  money. 

CHURCHES    AND  GEAVE-YARDS. 

On  a  beautiful  kaoll  in  the  northeastern  part  of 
the  township,  along  Simpson's  Creek,  is  situated 
what  is  known  as  the  Simpson  graveyard.  It  is  on 
the  farm  and  in  sight  of  the  spring  where  the 
cabin  was  built  in  the  fall  of  1808  which  sheltered 
the  surveying  party,  and  soon  became  the  home  of 
Thomas  Simpson,  Sr.,  whose  remains  there  rest,  and 
whose  name  it  honors.  The  first  death,  so  far  as  is 
known,  that  occurred  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  county, 
was  that  of  a  widow  woman  by  name  of  McDade, 
who  died  probably  before  the  war  of  1812,  or  there- 
abouts, and  her  remains  were  here  interred.  There 
is  no  inscribed  stone  that  marks  the  grave.  The  oldest 
grave  marked  is  that  of  "Jesse,  son  of  Thomas  and 
Sarah  Simpson,  died  March  27,  1816,  aged  two  years, 


ten  months  and  seventeen  days."  Another  early  inter- 
ment here  was  that  of  Elizabeth  Sutton  in  1822. 
Thomas  Simpson,  Sr.,  and  wife,  Sarah,  dying  in 
1848  and  1865,  respectively,  and  other  members  of 
the  family,  and  a  number  of  others  are  here  buried. 

In  July,  1814,  not  far  from  this  place  of  burial, 
was  chosen  by  Bros.  Litteral  and  McLaughlin  (a  com- 
mittee appointed  for  such)  the  site  of  the  first  meet- 
ing-house of  the  New  Bethel  Regular  Baptist  Church. 
They  paid  for  one  acre  of  ground  here  purchased  of 
Thomas  Simpson,  Sr. ,  12,  upon  which  was  erected  a 
log  meeting-house  26x20  feet. 

Elder  Stephen  Oldham,  Rebecca  Oldham,  John 
Keny,  Polly  Keny,  Thomas  Simpson  (deacon),  Sarah 
Simpson,  Rebecca  Conner,  Katharine  Williams, 
Charles  and  Jane. McLaughlin,  James  and  Sarah  Con- 
naway,  John  Keny,  Sr.,  Jonathan  Keny,  Polly  Keny, 
William  and  Ann  Oldham,  and  Susan  White,  had, 
January  15,  1814,  made  application  for  a  church  soci- 
ety, and  on  the  fourth  Friday  of  February  adopted 
Articles  of  Faith,  and  were  on  the  following  day  con- 
stituted a  Gospel  Baptist  Church  by  the  name  of  New 
Bethel,  by  the  Presbytery,  Lazarus  Whitehead,  from 
Elkhorn  Church,  and  James  Smith. 

Until  his  death,  in  1834,  Elder  Oldham  served 
this  people  from  the  beginning.  Subsequent  pastors 
have  been  Elders  William  Sparks,  George  Harlan, 
Daniel  Conner,  Thomas  Lyons  and  others.  Elders 
Reed  and  Parker  are  the  present  pastors. 

In  1821  steps  were  taken  to  select  another  site  for 
a  church  building,  and  in  1822  Elder  Oldham  gave  to 
the  society  one  acre  of  ground  where  llie  present 
building  stands;  and  upon  it  was  erected  a  second 
log  meeting-house,  under  the  superintendency  of 
Matthias  Dawson,  Aaron  and  Jonathan  Haugham.  In 
1860  the  present  neat  frame  structure  was  erected  on 
the  site  of  the  second  building,  at  a  cost  of  over 
$1,500. 

Alongside  of  this  building  is  another  neat  frame 
structure,  erected  in  1853  by  St.  Paul's  Evangelical 
Lutheran  Church,  which  was  organized  about  1851, 
with  the  following  membership:  Jacob,  Solomon 
Henry,  Jacob,  Sr.,  Daniel,  Benjamin,  Abraham  John, 
Sr.,  John  and  William  Scholl,  Jacob  and  Charles 
Riebsomer,  Isaac  Brown,  William  Roth,  Christian 
Isenhoser,  Margaret,  Nancy,  Elizabeth,  Sarah  Eliza- 
beth, Jane  and  Elizabeth  Scholl,  Mary  A.  Tittering- 
ton,  Hester  Scholl,  Mrs.  William  Rady,  Rebecca  and 
Sarah  Rubsamer,  Mrs.  Brown,  Anna  M.  Roth,  Sa- 
trona  Isenhoser,  Elizabeth  Heinbach,  John  and  Sam- 
uel Smallwood,  Daniel  Gise,  Thomas  Huston,  Robert 
Scarlet,  Michael  Brown,  David  Scholl,  Sarah  Hein- 
bach, Margaret  Smallwood,  Mary  Huston,  Amanda  A. 
Smallwood,  Mary  and  Eve  Brown,  Matilda  Gi^e,  and 
Hester  Huston. 


HISTORY  OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY.

The  church  building  was  dedicated  October  16, 
1853,  by  Rev.  Riser,  of  Dayton,  O.  Regular  services 
and  Sabbath-school  are  held  by  this  society  through 
out  the  year.  Present  pastor  is  Rev.  J.  A.  West.  So- 
ciety is  in  good  condition,  with  a  membership  of  sev- 
enty-live.    The  Sabbath-school  numbers  120  scholars. 

In  the  rear  of  these  buildings  is  a  burying- 
ground,  a  portion  of  which  comprised  a  part  of  the 
ground  given  by  Elder  Oldham  wheu  the  church  was 
built.  The  grounds  are  in  possession  of  the  Trustees 
of  the  two  churches.  Among  the  aged  buried  here 
are  the  following:  Samuel  Wilson,  aged  eighty  years ; 
Rachel,  his  wife,  sixty -two  years;  Christian  Brown, 
sixty-five  years;  Eve,  his  wife,  sixty-six  years;  John 
Scholl,  seventy-seven  years;  Sally,  his  wife,  sixty- 
three  years;  Jacob  Sholl,  Sr.,  ninety-six  years;  Mary 
M.,  his  wife,  sixty-five  years;  Elder  Stephen  Oldham, 
fifty-nine  years;  Joseph  Baldwin,  seventy-six  years; 
his  wife,  Sarah,  seventy-two  years;  Nathan  Roysdon, 
sixty-four  years;  William  Roysdon,  sixty-seven  years; 
James  Connaway,  eighty -one  years;  Sarah,  his  wife, 
ninety-one  years;  Samuel  Riggs,  eighty-eight  years; 
Elizabeth,  his  wife,  seventy-nine  years. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  Churches  at  Alquina  and 
Mt.  Garrison  are  at  least  sixty  years  old,  and  most 
likely  were  the  outgrowth  of  classes  formed  prior  to 
1820.  In  1828  or  1829  both  were  appointments  on 
Whitewater  Circuit,  and  to  which  they  belonged  for 
some  years  thereafter.  As  early  as  1829  or  therea- 
bouts, "  Veatch's  meeting-house  on  Mt.  Garrison  "  is 
referred  to.  The  house  as  originally  built  was  about 
half  its  present  size,  and  was  constructed  of  logs,  and 
is  now  the  northern  part  of  the  present  structure 
weather-boarded,  the  south  half  being  built  of  frame 
to  the  old  log  building  a  number  of  years  later.  The 
building  is  at  present  about  36x5 J:  feet.  Among  the 
early  members  were  some  of  the  Veatches,  the  Woos- 
ters,  Eyestones  and  Miliners.  The  father  of  James 
Wooster  was  a  Methodist  minister,  and  at  the  son's 
house  services  were  often  held. 

The  first  house  of  worship  for  the  Alquina  congre- 
gation was  ft  log  structure  about  24x34:  feet,  and 
stood  on  the  hill  probably  100  yards  east  of  the  pres- 
ent schoolhouse.  It  occupied  such  position  in  1839, 
but  when  built  we  cannot  state.  This  building  was 
used  until  the  present  one  constructed  of  frame  was 
completed.  The  dedication  of  the  latter  took  place 
August  8,  1858— sermon  by  Rev.  John  W.  Locke, 
then  Presiding  Elder  of  the  district.  Among  the 
early  members  were  the  Darters,  the  Joneses  and  the 
Mills. 

At  Mt.  Garrison  is  a  very  old  graveyard,  where 
within  ^the  shadow  of  the  old  church  sleep  many  to 
whom  she  looked  for  support  in  by-gone  years.  The 
ground  for  burial    purposes  was  deeded   by   James 


Veatch,  and  that  upon  which  the  church  stands  was 
donated  by  John  and  Samuel  Huflf.  The  earliest 
grave  marked  by  a  tombstone,  whose  inscription  is 
legible,  is  that  of  Susannah,  daughter  of  James  and 
Mary  Veatch,  died  July  9,  1819,  aged  one  year  and 
four  days.  Among  the  aged  buried  here  are: 
Robert  Wooster,  died  in  December,  1830,  aged  one 
hundred  and  one  years;  Mary,  his  wife,  in  1832,  sev- 
enty-five years;  James  Wooster,  sixty-six  years; 
Nancy,  his  wife,  eighty-six  years;  Amos  Miliner, 
a  Revolutionary  soldier,  ninety-one  years;  Jesse 
Pigmau,  eighty-sevea  years;  Adam  Ely,  seventy-three 
years;  James  Veatch,  eighty-five  years;  Elisha  Cran- 
del,  seventy-nine  years;  Margaret,  his  wife,  sixty- 
eight  years;  James  Bolton,  seventy-two  years;  Jane, 
his  wife,  seventy-nine  years;  Adam  Pigman,  eighty - 
six  years;  Mary,  his  wife,  seventy  nine  years. 

On  Village  Creek  in  Section  34  is  located  another 
burying-ground,  where  other  pioneers  rest,  among 
them  Hugh  Bell,  aged  eighty-five  years;  William 
Lair,  eighty  six  years;  Samuel  Bell,  seventy-five 
years;  Sarah,  his  wife,  seventy-two  years;  Robert 
Shields,  seventy-seven  years;  Margaret  Shields, 
eighty-three  years;  Mary,  wife  of  Philip  Loudenback, 
eighty  years.  The  oldest  grave  marked  by  a  legible 
tombstone  is  that  of  John  Lair,  Sr.,  died  October  7, 
1821.  The  following  epitaph  is  taken  from  a  tomb- 
stone in  one  of  the  family  burying-grounds  of  the 
township: 

"Not  all  the  pains  that  e'er  I  bore 
Shall  spoil  my  future  peace, 
For  death  and  hell  can  do  no  more 
Than  what  my  Father  please." 

MILLS  AND  DISTILLERIES. 

Among  those  who  operated  distilleries  in  the  early 
period  of  the  township's  history  were  John  Harlan, 
James  Riggs,  William  Walker,  Hige  Hubbell  and 
Michael  Petro.  Then  quite  extensive  peach  crops 
were  raised  and  good  peach  brandy  made.  Copper 
stills  at  that  period  were  found  on  nearly  every  spring 
or  branch.  The  father  of  Job  Stout  distilled  some 
later. 

The  first  and  only  grist-mill  of  the  township  was 
erected  on  Simpson's  Creek  some  time  prior  to  1826, 
by  Henry  Cashner,  who  also  run  in  connection  with 
it  a  saw-mill  and  distillery.  It  subsequently  passed 
into  the  hands  of  Peter  Fiant,  and  later  was  owned 
by  Lewis  Monger,  and  for  quite  a  number  of  years 
did  considerable  business,  but  finally  fell  into  disuse. 
The  old  frame  is  still  standing. 

HALF-CENTURY  CITIZENS.

LERIES— SCHOOLS— CHURCHES  AND  GRAVE-YARDS— HAMLETS— HALF-CENTURY  CITIZENS. 


COLUMBIA  is  the  central  of  the  southern  tier 
of  townships  of  the  county,  and  lies  south  of 
Connersville  Township,  west  of  the  river,  north  of 
Franklin  County,  and  east  of  the  township  of  Orange. 
It  was  one  of  the  original  townships  into  which  the 
county  was  divided  in  1819,  and  at  that  time  its 
boundaries  were  designated  as  follows:  "Begin- 
ning at  the  southeast  corner  of  Section  33  in  Town- 
ship 13,  Range  13;  thence  west  along  the  line  divid- 
ing the  counties  of  Franklin  and  Fayette  to  the  west- 
ern boundary  of  the  county  of  Fayette;  thence  north 
along  said  count}-  line  live  miles;  thence  on  a  direct 
line  east  to  the  northwest  corner  of  Section  8,  in 
Township  13,  Range  12;  thence  east  along  the  line 
dividing  Sections  8  and  9  in  Township  13,  Range  13; 
thence  south  on  the  line  dividing  said  Sections  8  and 
9,  to  the  southwest  corner  of  Section  16,  Township 
and  Range  last  aforesaid;  thence  east  to  the  line  divid- 
ing the  counties  of  Franklin  and  Fayette;  thence  south 
along  the  said  line  to  the  place  of  beginning." 

The  township  then  included,  besides  its  present 
territory,  all  of  Orange  Township  as  it  now  is,  except- 
the  two  northern  tiers  of  sections,  and  all  of  Jackson 
as  it  now  is,  except  the  two  eastern  tiers  of  sections 
south  of  Jennings  Township.  This  latter  territory  it 
lost  on  the  formation  of  Jackson  in  1820,  and  the 
former  on  the  formation  of  Orange  in  1822. 

The  surface  of  the  country  is  rolling,  portions  of 
which  are  considerably  broken,  though  along  the  river 
are  fine  bottoms  of  most  excellent  land.  The  streams 
are  Fall  Creek  in  the  north,  "West  Fork  of  Whitewater 
River  in  the  east,  and  crossing  the  central  and  south- 
western portions  are  the  north  and  south  branches  of 
Garrison's  Creek.  The  land  in  general  is  less  valu- 
able than  in  other  subdivisions  unless  it  be  Orange- 
Population  in  1880,  803.

PIONEER    SETTLEMENT    AND    BIOGRAPHY. 

Similar  tracts  of  land  in  this  township  to  those  in 
most  others  were  chosen  by  the  first  settlors,  namely, 
those  along  the  water  courses.  It  will  be  noticed 
that  all  entries  of  land  made  in  1811  were  along  the 
river  and  on  other  streams. 

The  settlement  of  the  township  may  be  said  to 
have  been  begun  in  the  year  1811;  however,  it  is 
quite   probable   that  William   Eagan,  an    Irishman, 


though  from  Maryland  here,  settled  earlier.  His 
brother,  John,  it  is  reliably  said,  was  living  in  a  cab- 
in just  over  the  river  from  the  Nulltown  bridge,  in 
Jackson  Township,  in  1809.  The  writer  has  been 
unable  to  learn  anything  definite  as  to  this  settle- 
ment, but  inasmuch  as  John  and  his  father  resided 
on  the  east  side  of  the  river,  and  almost  on  its  very 
banks,  and  from  the  fact  of  William  entering  land 
among  the  first,  upon  which  he  lived  and  died,  it  is 
not  unreasonable  to  suppose  that  he  most  likely  came 
at  the  same  time  the  other  members  of  the  family 
came. 

The  settlers  who  came  in  1811,  1812  and  1813 
settled  along  the  streams  named,  and  were  with  little, 
if  any,  exception,  from  the  State  of  Kentucky.  Those 
of  whom  any  definite  or  satisfactory  information  could 
be  obtained  are  William  Helm,  who  on  the  10th  of 
March,  1811,  with  family  emigrated  from  Mason 
County,  Ky.  He  and  his  wife  had  been  inmates  of 
Bryant's  Station  during  its  memorable  siege  by  the 
Indians,  and  the  husband  had  been  engaged  for  some 
time  in  the  border  wars.  At  the  beginning'  of  the  war 
of  1812  he  was  commissioned  Major,  and  placed  in 
command  of  the  troops  guarding  the  frontier.  Judge 
Helm  was  deeply  imbued  with  the  hospitality  of  his 
countrymen.  He  was  a  strong  and  good  man,  and  for 
a  number  of  years  was  one  of  the  Associate  Judges  of 
the  county.  "His  judgment  was  sound,  and  his  in- 
tegrity above  question.''  He  was  the  father  of  Mere- 
dith Helm,  of  this  county.  Dr.  Jefferson  Helm,  of  Rush, 
and  Robert  D.  Helm,  of  Wabash. 

Edward  Webb,  John  and  perhaps  Daniel  Con- 
ner (the  latter  brothers)  emigrated  from  Boone  Coun- 
ty, Ky.,  and  settled  on  the  Big  Bottom,  where  they 
resided  a  year  or  two  or  more,  and  while  there  visited 
the  Whitewater  country,  and  some  time  prior  to  the 
fall  of  1813  selected  and  purchased  laud,  built  cab- 
ins, set  out  two  orchards  and  in  the  spring  of  1814 
removed  their  families.  Mr.  Webb  was  a  man  of  con- 
siderable ability  and  figured  conspicuously  in  the 
early  affairs  of  the  county.  On  the  organization  of 
the  county  he  was  chosen  one  of  the  Associate  Judges 
and  was  honored  with  that  office  for  twenty-seven  con- 
secutive years,  at  the  expiration  of  which  time  he  ten- 
dered his  resignation  for  the  reason  that  his  hearing 
had  become  so  affected  that  he  could  not  hear  the  tes- 
timony. 

In  the  fall  of  1813 — not  long  before  Christmas — 
Allen  Crisler  and  Joshua  Crigler,  from  Boone  County, 
Ky.,  settled  in  the  same  neighborhood,  and  occupied 
one  or  both  cabins  above  referred  to  until  their  own 
homes  were  built. 

Vincent  Cooper  emigrated  from  Kentucky,  coming 
some  time  prior  to  the  Crislers  and  Criglers.

HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Bays,  Charles  Scott,  the  Gillams,  Jonathan  and  Dav- 
id, and  James  Newhouse  (from  Virginia)  settled  in 
the  township  prior  to  1814;  Isaac,  Enoch,  Levi,  Eli- 
jah and  Jonathan  Limptis,  brothers,  natives  of  Vir- 
ginia, though  they  had  settled  in  Kentucky  early, 
going  from  thence  to  Butler  County,  Ohio,  and  to 
what  is  now  Columbia  Township  in  1813. 

Many  of  these  early  families  were  related  and  came 
from  the  same  locality.  The  Webbs,  Conners,  Crig- 
lers,  Crislers,  Helms  and  Hacklemans  were  all  con- 
nected in  some  way. 

Philip  and  Horatio  Mason  with  their  wives  settled 
on  Garrison's  Creek  in  1817.  They  emigrated  from 
Herkimer  County,  N.  Y. ,  in  the  spring  of  1816,  go- 
ing by  sleigh  to  Olean  Point  on  the  Allegheny  River, 
thence  to  Cincinnati  by  raft  and  to  the  vicinity  of 
Laurel  by  wagon.  Samuel  Jenks,  a  brother-in-law 
to  Philip  Mason,  was  a  resident  of  that  vicinity  and 
with  him  Philip  stopped  and  shared  their  cabin  home 
until  in  Januai'y,  1817,  when  he  removed  to  a  cabin 
upon  land  on  Garrison's  Creek,  which  he  had  previ- 
ously purchased.  He  assisted  Mr.  Jenks  during  the 
season  of  1816  in  raising  a  crop  of  corn.  This  sea- 
son was  known  throughout  the  United  States  as  the 
cold  season.  Dr.  Mason  thus  refers  to  it  in  his 
autobiography.  "We  finished  planting  our  corn  on  the 
morning  of  the  7th  day  of  June,  our  fingers  suffering 
from  the  cold.  Though  we  had  frost  early  in  Octo- 
ber, which  injured  our  corn,  yet  we  had  what  might 
be  said  to  have  been  good  crops,  yielding  at  least  fif- 
ty bushels  of  good  corn  to  the  acre." 

Dr.  Mason  became  pi'ominent  in  the  affairs  of 
the  county.  Before  Fayette  County  was  formed  he 
served  as  one  of  the  Commissioners  of  Franklin 
County.  He  was  active,  useful  and  conspicuous 
from  the  very  beginning  in  the  pioneer  settlements  of 
the  vicinity  in  which  he  resided  and  prominent  in  sub- 
sequent life.  He  was  an  early  teacher,  farmer, 
miller,  merchant,  physician,  practicing  at  various 
points  throughout  the  county.  He  was  one  of  the 
early  militia  officers.  In  1839  he  was  chosen  the  first 
Judge  of  the  Probate  Court  of  the  county  and  served 
as  such  until  1834.  He  was  elected  to  the  State  Leg- 
islature in  1835  with  Caleb  B.  Smith.  He  served 
again  in  that  body  in  1838  and  in  1840.  Dr.  Mason 
was  a  very  prominent  Free  Mason.  He  served  as  Master 
of  Warren  Lodge  of  Connersville  for  a  period  of 
thirteen  years,  and  as  Grand  Master  of  the  Grand 
Lodge  of  the  State  eight  years. 

The  following  sketch  istaken  from  the  "Reminis- 
cences" of  Hon.  Elijah  Hackleman,  published  in  the 
Rushville  Republican  in  1884: 

"George  Pogue  emigrated  from  South  Carolina  in 
the  year  1814,  and  settled  at  the  'Block-house'  at 
William  Wilson's,  on  the  west  fork  of  Whitewater, 


six  miles  above  the  town  of  Brookville,  Franklin 
County.  At  that  time  it  was  necessary  for  all  immi- 
grants to  settle  near  some  military  post,  for  protec- 
tion against  Indian  invasions.  In  the  spring  of  1816 
he  moved  to  Fayette  County,  about  five  miles  south- 
west of  Connersville,  and  in  1818  he  moved  to  the 
town  of  Conner.sville,  remaining  there  until  1820, 
when  he  fitted  up  a  team,  and  with  two  or  three  of 
his  sons  started  to  locate  a  home  on  White  River. 
Mr.  Pogue  was  accompanied  by  John  McCormaek  and 
family  (a  wife  and  two  children),  who  had  resided 
for  many  years  in  the  vicinity  of  Connersville.  Mr. 
McCormaek  went  out  with  the  double  purpose,  first  of 
boarding  Mr.  Pogue's  hands  while  engaged  in  build- 
ing a  cabin  and  clearing  a  few  acres  of  ground;  and 
secondly,  of  locating  a  home  for  himself.  The  site 
chosen  by  Pogue  for  his  cabin  is  about  one  mile  east 
of  the  court  house  in  the  city  of  Indianapolis,  and 
about  eighty  rods  north  of  the  National  road.  After- 
ward when  the  location  of  the  city  of  Indianapolis 
was  made,  it  was  found  that  a  few  acres  of  Pogue's 
clearing  was  on  the  'Donation,'  that  is,  within  the 
four  sections  donated  for  a  capital  for  the  State.  His 
family,  after  the  cabin  was  built,  immediately  moved 
from  Connersville  to  their  new  home.  The  next  year 
(1821)  Mr.  Pogue's  neighbors  were  John  Willson, 
Thomas  Chinn,  and  Harris  Tyner. 

"Early  in  this  year  Mr.  Pogue's  horses  strayed 
away  toward  the  settlements  on  Whitewater,  and 
soon  afterward  he  took  his  dog  and  gun  and  started 
iu  pursuit.  Visiting  Connersville,  and  not  finding 
them,  he  then  came  through  the  new  settlements  on 
Little  Flat  Rock,  spending  some  days  with  his  son, 
William  Pogue,  and  then  started  on  his  return  home, 
making  Richard  Tyner's,  on  Blue  River,  near  Mor- 
ristown,  the  first  night.  Here  he  heard  of  an  Indian 
camp  on  Sugar  Creek,  some  eight  or  ten  miles  west, 
where  horses  answering  to  the  description  of  his  had 
been  seen  a  few  days  before  ifi  possession  of  the  Indi- 
ans. The  next  morning  Mr.  Pogue  started  for  the 
Indian  camp,  and  the  last  time  ho  was  ever  seen  was 
at  the  crossing  of  Blue  River,  near  Mr.  Tyner's.  A 
few  days  after  this  his  dog  returned  home.  It  was 
generally  thought  that  the  Indians  murdered  him;  if 
so,  it  was  probably  the  last  mui'der  committed  by 
Indians  in  central  Indiana.  If  I  recollect  correctly, 
a  few  years  later  one  of  his  horses  was  found  in  pos- 
session of  the  Indians,  in  the  Upper  Wabash  country. 

"The  widow  of  Mr.  Pogue  lived  here  for  a  number 
of  years,  raising  a  large  family  of  children.  A  few 
years  ago  she  was  still  living,  at  an  advanced  age, 
with  her  daughter,  Mrs.  Anna  Fullen,  near  Crawfords- 
ville,  having  spent  a  life-time  in  anxiously  awaiting 
some  ray  of  light  on  the  mysterious  disappearance  of 
her  long  lost  husband.      The  land  on  which  the  cabin

stood  was  bought  by  Gov.  Noble,  and  the  only 
time  I  ever  visited  the  site  was  on  the  occasion 
when  the  "Great  Commoner"  from  Kentucky,  Henry 
Clay,  made  his  first  and  only  visit  to  the  capital  of  our 
State,  in  October,  1842,  and  made  his  celebrated 
speech  to  30,000  persons  assembled  in  the  beautiful 
grove  near  the  residence  of  Gov.  Noble.  The  senti- 
ments uttered  by  that  great  statesman  became  the 
keynotes  for  the  Presidential  campaign  of  181:8. 
William  Pogue  and  myself  had  come  over  from  Rush- 
ville,  by  the  way  of  Greenfield,  and  joined  the  escort 
of  the  State's  distinguished  guest  at  the  latter  place, 
and  had  done  our  share  of  '  kicking  up  a  dust, '  along 
the  National  road  to  the  Capitol,  the  main  caravan 
f  rom  Eushville  of  250  wagons  having  taken  the  direct 
road  to  Indianapolis. 

"But  I  must  not  digress,  as  these  incidents  may 
come  up  iu  a  future  number.  What  I  wish  to  say  is, 
that  after  the  speech,  William  Pogue  invited  me  to 
take  a  walk  with  him,  a  few  rods  north  from  the 
speaker's  stand,  and  visit  the  site  where  he,  twen- 
ty-two years  before,  had  helped  his  father  erect  the 
first  cabin  in  all  that  country,  on  the  banks  of  a  beau- 
tiful little  creek  that  still  bears  the  name  of  'Pogue's 
Run,'  its  clear,  limpid  waters  still  sparkling  and 
flashing  in  the  sunlight,  as  in  the  days  of  yore,  ever 
reminding  the  visitor  of  that  sturdy  old  pioneer, 
George  Pogue,  who,  in  primitive  times,  marked  out 
the  first  road  through  the  dense  forest,  from  the  White- 
water Valley  to  the  site  of  the  State  capital,  but  of 
whose  resting-place,  no  man  knows.  After  the  erec- 
tion of  Pogue's  cabin,  Mr.  McCormack  located  and 
built  up  a  home  somewhere  in  the  vicinity,  probably 
on  what  was  afterward  the  'Donation;'  but  of  the 
exact  site  neither  history  nor  tradition  affords  any 
satisfactory  information  this  late  day.  Mr.  McCor- 
mack died  a  little  over  fifty  years  ago,  and  part  of  his 
large  family  found  homes  in  Rush  County.  One  lit- 
tle waif  (Mary  Ann)  floated  to  my  father's  house, 
and  afterward  became  the  wife  of  James  Hawkins, 
who  for  a  number  of  years  was  an  honored  citizen  of 
the  Upper  Wabash  Valley,  and  whose  oldest  son 
marched  at  the  head  of  a  company  with  '  Sherman  to 
the  Sea.'  Mrs.  McCormack  always  claimed  to  be  the 
first  white  woman  that  lived  within  the  limits  of  the 
city  of  Indianapolis,  and  her  claim  was  probably  cor- 
rect. She  died  about  the  year  1878,  having  lived  a 
number  of  years  with  a  second  husband,  a  Mr.  King, 
near  the  Bluflfs  of  White  River.  On  the  last  visit  of 
Mrs.  King  to  her  niece,  Mrs.  James  S.  Sailors,  of 
Indianapolis,  in  1875,  an  ovation  was  given  her  by 
some  of  the  old  citizens  of  the  place,  at  which  time  a 
t7o(M-&gt;iaZ  reporter  snatched  from  oblivion  several  inci- 
dents of  olden  times,  as  related  by  her." 

The  venerable  John  A.  White,  still  a  resident  of 


the  township,  though  his  hair  is  silvered  by  the 
frosts  of  quite  ninety  winters,  came  to  the  neighbor- 
hood in  August,  1815,  locating  on  Williams  Creek, 
but  in  the  course  of  a  year  or  little  more  removed  to 
the  vicinity  of  his  present  residence,  and  with  little 
exception  has  resided  there  ever  since.  Mr.  White  is 
a  native  of  Virginia,  born  in  1795.  His  father  died 
when  he  was  quite  young;  his  mother  remarrying,  he, 
in  his  sixteenth  year,  left  home,  going  to  the  State 
of  Kentucky.  In  August,  1813,  at  Somerset,  in  that 
State,  he  volunteered  in  the  Fifteenth  Regiment, 
Kentucky  Infantry,  commanded  by  Col.  Salter,  Lieu- 
tenant-Governor of  the  State.  He  was  on  the  vessel 
commanded  by  Commodore  Perry,  at  Lake  Erie,  three 
days  after  the  battle,  and  while  it  was  yet  stained 
with  blood.  He  was  in  Shelby's  brigade  in  the  reserve 
of  Johnson,  at  the  battle  of  the  Thames,  and  viewed 
the  lifeless  form  of  Tecumseh,  on  the  batle-tield. 
He  was  on  the  picket  line  at  New  Orleans  that 
brought  on  the  battle,  in  which  he  participated;  his 
service  in  all  consisting  of  two  compaigns,  the  first  of 
three  months'  duration,  when  he  retired  to  the  farm, 
resuming  his  occupation.  Here  he  remained,  until, 
feeling  that  his  country  was  in  peril,  he,  like  Cin- 
cinnatus  of  old,  left  the  plow  in  the  furrow,  and 
again  went  to  the  front  and  served  for  a  period  of 
nine  months  and  three  days.  Mr.  White,  in  1821, 
married  Emelia,  daughter  of  Allen  Crisler,  and  they 
have  shared  life's  joys  and  cares  together  upward  of 
sixty-three  years.  A  modest  little  log-cabin  on  the 
brow  of  a  hill,  just  below  the  village  of  Alpine,  com- 
manding a  beautiful  and  picturesque  view  of  the  river 
and  suiTounding  hills,  built  by  his  own  hands,  and 
which  for  more  than  a  half  century  has  sheltered  them 
from  the  storms  of  winter  and  summer's  heat,  is  yet 
their  dwelling  place,  where  around  the  hearthstone  of 
their  early  married  years  happy  hours  were  whiled 
away,  and  where  played  their  children  and  children's 
children,  this  venerable  and  pure-minded  couple  are 
passing  the  evening  of  their  lives  together.* 

In  1819,  Joshua  Heizer,  a  native  of  Virginia,  and 
a  soldier  in  the  war  of  1812,  settled  in  the  township. 

Reuben  Conner,  from  Boone  County,  Ky. ,  settled 
in  the  township  in  1819.  He  was  occupied  as  a  farmer, 
and  died  in  1847.  He  was  the  father  of  B.  F.  Con- 
ner, of  this  county. 

A  number  of  these  early  pioneers  not  only  were 
identified  in  the  great  transformation  of  the  wilder- 
ness into  blossoming  fields,  but  played  their  part 
in  the  early  political,  civil  and  religious  history  of 
the  county.  We  have  noticed  above  the  valuable 
services  of  Judges  Webb  and  Helm  and  Dr.  Mason. 
Two  of  the  Conners,  John  and  Daniel,  were  for  a  long 

♦Since  the  above  was  written  we  learn  that  Mr.  White  has  passed  away, 
his  death  having  occurred  in  the  fall  of  1S84.

period  of  years  ministers  in  the  Old  School  Baptist 
Church. 

The  old  residence  built  and  occupied  by  Judge 
Webb  about  1817  still  stands,  occupying  a  site  on 
the  fertile  bottom  land  along  Whitewater  River,  a 
situation  commanding  a  beautiful  view.  It  is  of  the 
second  class  of  pioneer  cabins,  constructed  of  hewed 
logs,  two  stories  high  and  the  building  in  size  being 
about  18x28  feet;  on  the  north  end  of  the  building  is 
a  large  chimney  constructed  of  stone  of  various  sizes, 
built  on  the  outside  of  the  house;  two  doors  from 
without  open  into  the  house,  one  on  either  side. 
Below  on  either  side  is  one  window,  though  of  differ- 
ent sizes,  and  on  the  east  side  of  the  second  floor  are 
two  half  or  garret  windows.  Within  the  house  are 
three  apartments,  one  above  and  two  below,  each 
floor  being  provided  with  one  fireplace,  large  below 
and  small  on  the  second  floor.  This  is  said  to  have 
been  the  substantial  house  of  that  day  in  the  settle- 
ment. 

Just  below  Nulltown,  and  not  far  from  the  old 
burying-ground,  stood  the  old  block-house  built  by 
the  settlement  for  protection  against  the  Indians 
during  the  war  of  1S12. 

The  Winchol  family  settled  in  what  is  now  the 
township,  during  the  first  decade  in  the  century,  and 
formed  a  part  of  that  noble  band  instrumental  in  con- 
verting the  forests  of  that  day  into  the  beautiful  fields 
of  this. 

MILLS  AND  DISTILLERIES. 

The  first  mill  in  the  township  is  thought  to  have 
been  a  saw-mill  erected  by  Allen  Crisler.  It  stood 
not  far  from  the  present  site  of  the  barn  of  William 
Seals,  at  the  north  end  of  Alpine.  This  mill  was  in 
operation  in  the  summer  of  1815,  and  was  built  not 
far  from  that  time,  likely  in  1814.  Dr.  Mason  in  his 
autobiography  speaks  of  framing  a  mill-house  for 
Allen  Crisler  in  the  summer  of  1816.  The  Doctor 
traded  his  farm  for  the  mill  that  fall,  and  thus 
speaks  of  it:  "There  was  a  very  good  saw-mill,  with 
a  separate  building,  a  good  stone  wall  for  the  first 
story,  on  which  stood  the  frame  I  had  put  up  for  a 
mill-house,  with  one  run  of  common  granite  mill- 
stones, and  a  bolting  chest  with  a  small  bolt,  which 
was  turned  by  hand  for  bolting  flour  made  from 
wheat."  The  mills  were  operated  by  the  Doctor  and 
his  brother  Horatio,  who  became  a  partner,  until  in 
the  fall  of  1818,  when  the  same  parties  resumed  their 
old  possessions— trading  back.  In  about  1817  John 
A.  White  commenced  as  the  miller  at  this  mill. 
Subsequently  a  still-house  and  hemp-mill  were  added, 
and  all  four  operated  by  Col.  Crisler,  until  a  change 
in  the  coarse  of  the  river  destroyed  the  power  and  all 
vrent  into  disuse. 

Thomas  Silvy  built  a  saw-mill  at  quite  an   early 


date  at  Nulltown,  which  finally  passed  into  the  hands 
of  the  Null  brothers,  Israel  and  Michael,  who  built 
an  addition  to  it — a  little  grist-mill — and  after  Cris- 
ler's  mill  went  down,  the  Nulls  built  a  very  large 
flouring  and  grist-mill,  which  was  not  in  operation 
many  years,  the  canal  and  hydraulic  destroying  the 
power. 

Not  far  from  1844  the  present  grist-mill  at  Alpine 
was  built  by  Thomas  J.  Crisler,  James  and  John 
Limpus.  This  was  operated  by  these  men  for  a  time, 
then  passed  through  various  hands,  and  in  1863  it 
was  purchased  by  Thomas  and  A.  N.  Bruner,  and  it  is 
still  in  the  Bruner  name.  The  saw-mill  here  was 
built  by  the  same  parties  two  years  prior. 

In  the  early  history  of  the  township  there  were 
copper  stills  operated  on  almost  every  spring  or 
branch.  About  1819  William  Helm  had  one  in  oper- 
ation on  Garrison's  Creek,  and  about  the  same  time 
John  Conner  had  one  on  his  farm.  On  Garrison's 
Creek,  in  1815  or  thereabouts,  there  was  quite  an 
extensive  distillery  carried  on  by  Wilson  Waddams. 
He  at  first,  while  Indiana  was  yet  a  Territory,  oper- 
ated a  small  still,  and  some  later  built  the  large  one. 
There  was  a  corn  ci-acker  in  connection  with  the  latter. 

About  the  year  1833  H.  N.  Burgoyne  built  a  saw 
and  grist-mill  in  Section  19  on  the  south  fork  of 
Garrison's  Creek,  which  after  changing  hands  a 
number  of  times  fell  into  the  possession  of  Nathan 
Lewis  and  brother,  some  twenty  years  ago,  and  was 
carried  on  by  them  two  years,  when  they  built  the 
present  saw-mill  on  that  site. 

Probably  one  mile  above  the  Wilson  Waddam 
mill  and  distillery,  on  the  south  fork  of  Garrison's 
Creek,  Isaac  Thomas  built  a  saw-mill  not  far  from 
forty  years  ago. 

Isaac  Limpus  for  several  years  operated  a  copper 
still  on  his  land.  Some  forty-eight  or  fifty  years  ago 
James  Limpus  carried  on  distilling  on  a  large  scale 
near  Columbia. 

The  distillery  now  below  Nulltown  was  removed 
from  Jackson  Township  by  a  company  some  eight  or 
ten  years  ago,  by  whom  the  business  was  carried  on 
several  years.     It  is  not  in  use  at  present. 

EARLY    SCHOOLS. 

The  first  schoolhouse  built  in  the  township  was 
near  the  old  graveyard  and  Franklin  Church  just 
below  Nulltown,  erected  in  the  Kentucky  settlement 
probably  in  the  spring  or  summer  of  1815.  Gabriel 
Ginn,  who  is  thought  to  have  taught  the  first  school 
in  this  house  in  1815,  was  the  master  in  that  house 
and  settlement  for  several  years.  This  schoolhouse 
was  built  prior  to  the  old  Franklin  meeting  house 
that  stood  by  it,  which  was  commenced  in  1815. 
Some  years  later  school  was  taught  in  a  cabin  about

one  mile  southwest  of  Alpine,  by  Mark  Whitacre,  a 
Kentuckian;  Robert  Helm  and  Miss  Klum  taught  in 
that  neighborhood.  In  1821  or  just  prior  thereto  a 
log  cabin  schoolhouse  was  built  about  one  mile  west 
of  Alpine;  Daniel  Mclntyre,  a  Kentuckian,  taught 
here  early.  Misa  Klum  and  Dr.  Philip  Mason  also 
taught  in  this  house.  In  speaking  of  the  winter  of 
1820-21,  Dr.  Mason,  in  his  autobiography,  says,  "I 
then  engaged  to  teach  a  school  during  the  next  win- 
ter in  a  log-cabin  schoolhouse  that  stood  on  my  land. 
Early  in  December  I  commenced  my  school.  It  was 
made  up  of  children  from  seven  to  seventeen  years 
of  age,  all  of  whom  had  had  very  limited  opportuni- 
ties of  learning.  A.  B.  C's. ,  spelling  and  reading 
constituted  by  far  the  most  that  was  taught.  A  few 
learned  to  write,  and  a  very  few  studied  the  simples 
of  arithmetic."  *****  Jq  subsequent 
houses  built  for  the  accommodation  of  the  children 
in  this  section  of  the  county,  or  vacated  dwelling 
cabins  used  for  school  purposes,  Benjamin  Smith, 
David  Allen,  George  Winchell  and  Jefferson  Cris- 
ler  are  remembered  as  teachers. 

In  the  northern  part  of  the  township,  on  the  Hink- 
Bon  Halstead  land,  stood  one  of  the  early  school - 
houses  of  that  section  of  the  country.  John  Bonald 
taught  the  first  school  in  this  cabin. 

CHURCHES  AND  GRAVE -YABD8. 

At  the  grave -yard  just  south  of  Nulltown  was 
originally  located  the  Old  School  Baptist  Church. 
The  land  now  constituting  the  grave-yard  and  that 
adjoining  it  on  the  north,  where  the  old  meeting- 
house stood,  was  purchased  of  Abraham  Bays  and 
William  Egan  late  in  the  year  1814,  or  in  January, 
1815.  On  the  5th  of  February,  1814,  at  an  assembly 
of  the  Old  School  Baptists  residing  in  the  surround- 
ing country,  it  was  agreed  to  meet  at  the  house  of 
Mary  Martin  on  Garrison's  Creek,  March  27th  fol- 
lowing, for  the  purpose  of  constituting  a  church.  At 
this  meeting  Elders  Lewis  Dewesse  and  William 
Tyner,  from  Cedar  Grove,  Elder  James  Smith  from 
West  Fork,  and  Elder  John  Blades,  with  some  lay 
members  or  messengers,  constituted  the  church,  which 
was  designated,  Franklin  Baptist  Church,  with  the 
following  members:  Charles  Scott,  William  and 
Elizabeth  Helm,  Archibald  and  Rachel  Guthrie, 
Allen  and  Frances  Crisler,  John  and  Polly  Conner, 
Joshua  and  Sarah  Crisler,  David  and  Elizabeth 
Gilliam,  Jonathan  and  Polly  Gilliam,  William  and 
Sarah  Morgan,  Edward  and  Polly  Webb,  John  Webb, 
James  and  Elizabeth  Newhouse,  and  Hugh  Brownlee. 

Meetings  were  held  at  private  dwellings  until  the 
meeting  house  was  constructed,  which  they  agreed  to 
build  the  following  February.  This  meeting-house 
was  constructed  of  hewed  logs,  having  one  story  and 


a  gallery.  In  March,  1815,  Messrs.  Webb,  Crisler 
and  Sailors  were  appointed  to  let  the  building  of  the 
meeting-house  to  the  lowest  bidder.  It  seems  from 
the  records  that  the  gallery,  pulpit  lloor  and  seats 
were  not  finished  until  1817;  however,  the  building 
was  in  use  long  before  its  completion. 

The  pulpit  was  for  several  years  supplied  by  the 
preachers  from  the  neighboring  churches.  John  Con- 
ner was  ordained  an  Elder  in  1817,  who,  in  connection 
with  Elder  James  Newhouse,  served  the  church  until 
his  death,  and  the  latter  until  his  removal.  Later, 
another  of  the  Elders  was  Daniel  Conner.  Elder 
Madison  Conner  was  for  years  one  of  the  regular  res- 
ident ministers.  Next  came  Elder  William  Sparks, 
who  still  preaches  for  them.  The  old  meeting-house 
in  the  course  of  years  became  unfit  for  use,  and  not 
far  from  1850  was  abandoned,  and  the  congregation 
secured  land  of  Allen  Crisler  at  Alpine,  that  point 
being  more  convenient,  and  upon  it  built  the  present 
frame  edifice. 

In  1855  the  present  frame  church  building  near 
the  grave-yard  before  referred  to  was  erected  and  has 
since  been  used  by  the  Fayette  Baptist  Church.  This 
was  the  outgrowth  of  the  division  in  the  church  gen- 
eral, occurring  in  1845  or  1840.  June  30,  1849, 
Elder  Daniel  Conner,  H.  D.  Conner  and  wife,  Mary 
Conner,  Nancy  Reed,  Henry  Morrfs,  Corwin  Mills- 
paugh  and  wife,  and  Benjamin  F.  Carter  were  con- 
stituted the  Fayette  Baptist  Church.  Before  the 
erection  of  the  meeting-house  services  were  held  in 
the  neighborhood  schoolhouse.  Elder  Daniel  Conner, 
until  his  death,  was  the  regular  preacher  in  charge  of 
the  congregation.  He  was  assisted  by  Elders  Harvey 
Wright,  Corwin  Millspaugh,  H.  W.  Conner  and  Ben- 
jamin F.  Carter,  four  gifts  that  had  soon  come  out  of 
the  church,  and  were  ordained  in  1854,  from  that  year 
until  they  were  removed  by  death  or  left  the  neigh- 
borhood. One  of  the  number.  Elder  D.  H.  Conner, 
is  still  with  the  conejreg'ation. 

The  first  person  buried  in  the  old  grave  yard  was 
the  body  of  Sally  Martin,  who  died  in  1814  or  1815. 
The  oldest  grave  marked  by  a  tombstone  is  that  of 
Elizabeth  Fullen,  consort  of  Samuel  Fullen,  born  Jan- 
uary 30,  1775,  died  November  18,  1818.  Among  the 
aged  whose  remains  rest  here  and  are  marked  by 
tombstones  bearing  legible  inscriptions  are  Phoebe, 
wife  of  John  Egan,  died  in  1855,  aged  sixty-five 
years;  Levi  Limpus,  died  in  1867,  aged  seventy-nine 
years;  Elizabeth  Limpus,  died  in  1854,  aged  sixty- 
four  years;  Joel  Scott,  died  in  1855,  aged  sixty-nine 
years;  Ellen  Burrows,  died  in  1831,  aged  seventy- 
three  years;  Thomas  Ross,  died  in  1877,  aged  ninety- 
six  years. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  at  Columbia  is 
the  outgrowth  of  the  old  Hardy  class,  composed  of 


198 


HISTORY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


the  family  of  that  name— parents,  daughters,  and  a 
son,  John,  and  possibly  others.  The  father  was  a 
local  preacher,  who  had  traveled  in  Georgia  before 
his  location  here.  This  was  an  appointment  on  the 
Oonnersville  Circuit  when  it  was  organized  in  1822, 
with  which  it  remained  until  Columbia  Circuit  was 
organized  in  1851,  with  Rev.  Thomas  Williams  as 
preacher.  Since  that  time  Columbia  has  been  one  of 
the  appointments  with  the  several  Methodist  Episco- 
pal Churches  in  the  western  part  of  the  county.  Their 
next  frame  edifice  was  erected  some  years  prior  to  the 
late  war. 

Near  the  church  is  a  beautiful  cemetery  which  is 
dotted  over  with  graves  marked  by  a  number  of  mon- 
uments of  neat  and  pretty  design.  The  yard  does 
not  give  evidence  of  age,  as  the  oldest  inscription  we 
found  bears  the  date  of  1845.  Among  the  aged 
interred  here  were  Liters  Black,  died  in  1881,  aged 
eighty-live  years;  William  Jones,  born  in  1790,  died 
in  1871;  Lucinda  Jones,  born  in  1790,  died  in  1862; 
William  Wherrett,  died  in  1852,  aged  eighty-one 
years;  Zimri  Utter,  born  in  1794,  died  in  1880; 
Susan,  his  wife,  born  in  1798,  died  in  1864. 

TuUis  Chapel,  a  Methodist  Episcopal  Church, 
situated  in  the  northern  part  of  the  township,  dates 
back  to  the  organization  of  Connersville  Circuit,  in 
1822,  at  which  time  a  class  had  been  assembling  at 
the  house  of  Mr.  Hinkson,  which  was  located  in  what 
is  now  the  southern  part  of  Connersville  Township. 
Among  the  early  members  were  John  Hinkson  and 
wife  Elizabeth,  and  their  daughter  Susan,  Anna 
Reagan,  a  Mrs.  Roberts,  William  Harrall,  and  George 
Hinkson  and  wife.  Of  this  class  John  Grace  was  the 
Leader.  The  first  building  erected  by  the  society  was 
of  brick,  and  not  far  from  the  year  1836.  The  pres- 
ent building  was  built  during  the  early  part  of  the 
late  war  Until  the  organization  of  Columbia  Cir- 
cuit in  1851,  this  appointment  was  on  Connersville 
Circuit.  It  has  since  been  connected  with  other  so- 
cieties along  the  western  part  of  the  county — on  cir- 
cuits that  have  since  been  the  outgrowth  of  Conners- 
ville Circuit. 

The  grave-yard  near  by  is  as  old  as  the  church. 
One  acre  of  ground  for  both  purposes  was  given  by 
Henry  Tullis.  The  new  building  was  erected  on 
ground  deeded  by  John  Messersmith. 

In  1829,  or  by  the  spring  of  1830,  the  Rev.  John 
D.  Thompson,  formerly  an  Old  School  Baptist  minis- 
ter, though  then  recently  preaching  the  doctrines  of 
the  Reformation  (Campbellism),  organized  such  a  so- 
ciety at  the  house  of  Judge  Webb,  along  the  river 
near  Nulltown.  This  may  be  said  to  have  been  the 
beginning  of  what  years  afterward  resulted  in  the  so- 
ciety organized  at  Columbia,  which  erected  the  church 
building  still  standing  there,  though  with  little  ex- 


ception disused  during  the  past  decade  by  that  denom- 
ination. Among  those  identified  with  the  church 
in  after  years  were  the  Blakes,  Utters,  Thomases, 
Heizers,  Michners  and  Johnsons. 

Not  far  from  1855  the  United  Brethren  Church 
located  close  by  the  Lewis  saw-mill  on  the  creek  was 
erected,  the  organization  having  taken  place  some  time 
previous.  The  minister  organizing  the  society  and 
for  some  time  the  preacher  in  charge  was  Rev.  Mr. 
Shumway.  Among  the  early  members  of  the  church 
were  the  Stephenses,  Wilsons,  and  Cushners.  Of  the 
early  ministers  who  preached  to  this  people  are  re- 
membered Revs.  John  Morgan  and  Alexander  Carroll. 

What  is  known  as  the  old  Webb  burying-ground, 
located  on  high  ground  on  the  creek  west  of  the  old 
Webb  homestead,  heretofore  described,  had  its  origin 
in  the  family  burying-ground  of  the  Judge,  after 
whose  death  the  land  fell  to  a  son.  Forest,  who 
deeded  it  to  the  county  for  a  public  place  of  burial. 
This  was  not  in  use  quite  as  early  as  the  old  Frank- 
lin j^ard.  The  first  interment  here  was  an  infant 
grandchild  of  Judge  Webb.  In  this  yard  rest  the 
remains  of  many  of  the  pioneers  of  the  vicinity: 

Michael  Hackleman,  died  in  1869,  aged  eighty 
years;  Edward  Webb,  died  in  1851,  aged  eighty-one 
years;  Reuben  Conner,  died  in  1847,  aged  sixty-nine 
years;  Nancy  Conner,  died  in  1870,  aged  eighty-six 
years;  Sarah  Gaines,  died  in  1858,  aged  seventy-six 
years;  Allen  Crisler,  died  in  1837,  aged  fifty-eight 
years;  Frances  Crisler,  died  in  1846,  aged  sixty-two 
years;  Joshua  Crigler,  died  in  1859,  aged  seventy- 
five  years;  Sallie  Crigler,  died  in  1839,  aged  forty- 
five  years. 

HAMLETS. 

Columbia,  situated  north  of  the  center  of  the 
township,  was  laid  out  on  the  lands  of  Isaac  Limpus 
and  James  Buchanan;  that  part  north  of  Main 
Street  and  the  State  road,  on  the  land  of  the  latter, 
and  that  south  of  Main  Street,  on  the  land  of  Isaac 
Limpus.  The  surveying  was  done  by  Isaac  Fowler, 
June  15,  1832.  In  1849  an  addition  to  the  place 
was  made  by  one  Martin.  Isaac  Limpus  is  thought 
to  have  built  the  first  frame  house  in  the  hamlet,  and 
in  it  he  kept  a  place  of  entertainment,  or  inn.  He 
was  licensed  by  the  Commissioners  to  keep  a  grocery 
and  retail  liquor  in  1834.  The  year  previous  John 
Hardy  was  granted  a  license  as  a  merchant,  which  was 
renewed  for  several  years.  Later,  George  Scott, 
David  Smith  and  George  Logan  sold  goods  here. 

In  1843  the  hamlet  had  two  general  stores  kept 
by  George  Scott  and  Horatio  Mason  and  John 
Hardy;  one  wagon -making  shop,  by  Louis  Black;  one 
general  repair  shop,  by  D.  O' Darby;  one  shoe  shop 
and  postoffice  combined,  by  William  Wherrett,  and 
one  blacksmith  shop,  by  Joseph  Little. 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


199 


The  estimated  population  of  the  place  at  this  time 
is  fifty,  and  it  consists  of  a  postoffice,  one  repair 
wagon  shop,  a  blacksmith  shop,  and  a  church  (two 
church  buildings). 

Alpine,  situated  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  town- 
ship, is  a  station  on  the  Whitewater  Valley  Railroad, 
and  consists  of  a  few  dwelling  houses,  one  store,  one 
saw-mill,  one  grist-mill,  a  cooper-shop,  and  a  black- 
smith shop. 

The  hamlet  of  NuUtown  is  located  on  the  same 
railroad,  nearly  two  miles  north  of  Alpine.  It  is 
also  a  station  on  the  railroad,  and  a  postoffice  is  lo- 
cated here.     The  place  has  two  stores. 

Both  Alpine  and  NuUtown  owe  their  origin  to  the 
mills  erected  there.

JACKSON  TOWNSHIP  occupies  the  southeastern 
corner  of  the  county.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north 
by  Connersville  and  Jennings  Townships,  on  the 
east  by  Union  County,  on  the  south  by  Franklin 
County,  and  on  the  west  by  the  West  Fork  of  White- 
water River.  Originally,  its  territory  belonged  to 
Columbia  Township,  and  in  August,  1820,  it  was 
ordered  by  the  Commissioners  that  all  that  part  of 
Colnmbia  Township,  as  it  is  now  bounded  and 
recorded,  which  lies  east  of  West  Fork  of  Whitewater, 
be  stricken  off  of  said  township,  under  the  name  and 
title  of  Jackson  Township.  In  size  it  was  then  six 
sections  less  than  at  present.  These  six  sections  con- 
stituted the  strip  of  territory  described  in  the  general 
county  history  (extending  two  miles  east  and  west, 
and  three  north  and  south,  across  the  eastern  portion 
of  the  township)  as  acquired  from  Franklin  County 
by  an  Act  of  the  General  Assembly,  approved  in  Jan- 
uary, 1826.  This  strip  of  country  was,  by  the  Com- 
missioners, in  March  of  that  year,  attached  to  the 
township  under  consideration.  The  boundaries  of  the 
township  have  since  remained  unchanged.  The  face 
of  the  country  is  rolling  and  in  localities  some  broken. 
It  is  watered  by  West  Fork,  Wilsons',  Duck,  Eli's  and 
Bear  Creeks.  In  1880  the  population  of  the  town- 
ship as  shown  by  the  United  States  census  was  982.

Crowley,  Michael  Null  and  James  Conwell. 

EARLY    SETTLEMENT. 

Many  of  the  above-named  purchasers  of  lands 
were  actual  settlers,  and  the  dates  of  purchase  fix 
about  the  period  of  their  emigration  thereto.  It 
will  be  observed  that  the  first  lands  entered  were  in 
the  fall  of  the  year  1811,  and  that  such  with  some  ex- 
ception were  along  the  West  Fork  of  Whitewater 
River,  in  Sections  11,  12,  14,  23  and  25,  Township  13 
north.  Range  12  east,  the  exceptions  being  in  Sections 
27,  33  and  34,  Township  13  north.  Range  13  east,  lying 
in  the  southeastern  part  of  the  township.  The  earliest 
settlements  were  made  chielly  by  emigrants  from  the 
Southern  States,  South  Carolina  and  Kentucky  prob- 
ably supplying  the  greater  number. 

Of  those  entering  lands  in  1811,  Daniel  Green  was 
from  one  of  the  Carolinas,  Charles  and  James  Salyers 
from  South  Carolina,  and  John  Eagan  from  Freder- 
ick County,  Md.,  and  Gabriel  Ginn  from  Kentucky, 
all  of  whom  were  residents  of  their  several  tracts  at 
about  the  date  given.  Charles  Salyers  was  for  eight 
years  one  of  the  County  Commissioners,  and  Gabriel 
Ginn  served  as  County  Clerk  and  also  as  Sheriff  for 
a  number  of  years.  It  is  said  that  Daniel  Green, 
while  prospecting  for  land  further  south  in  what  is 
now  Franklin  County,  in  the  year  1809,  was  attracted 
by  the  sound  of  a  cow-bell  and  upon  following  it  he

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


came  to  a  cabin  occupied  by  John  Eagan  and  family, 
situated  along  the  river  in  what  is  now  the  township 
under  consideration,  some  little  distance  south  of  the 
bridge  over  the  river  at  Nulltown.  Mr.  Eagan 
was  an  Irishman.  This  Eagan  settlement  was  the 
earliest  in  the  township  of  which  we  have  been  able 
to  get  any  knowledge,  and  it  is  with  little  doubt,  if 
any,  the  first  permanent  settlement  made  in  the  town- 
ship. Mr.  Green  settled  in  the  township  in  the  spring 
of  1812. 

Daniel  Moore,  a  native  of  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  is 
said  to  have  come  to  the  "Twelve-Mile  Purchase"  in 
1809,  and  after  spending  one  winter  in  Brookville,  in 
March,  1810,  to  have  settled  in  Jackson  Township, 
and  there  spent  his  life,  dying  in  1882. 

In  1812  Joel  Scott  from  South  Carolina  and 
James  Craig  from  Virginia  made  their  settlement. 

About  this  time  came  the  Pumphreys  and  Benches 
from  Maryland. 

In  the  fall  of  1813  (October  5)  several  families 
from  the  same  neighborhood  in  Pendleton  District, 
S.  C. ,  and  all  related,  emigrated  and  settled  on  lands 
in  the  southeastern  part  of  the  township.  There  were 
Ebenezer  Smith,  George  Stanley,  Simon  Grist,  James 
Waters  and  son  John  Waters,  all  men  of  families. 
The  Waterses  had  been  to  the  vicinity  in  1812  and  then 
made  their  purchase,  but  returned  and  all,  as  just 
stated,  made  the  journey  together,  which  consumed 
about  one  month,  coming  by  wagons.  It  is  believed 
by  the  descendants  of  some  of  these  families  that  on 
their  arrival  there  were  no  residents  south  and  east 
of  Everton  to  what  are  now  the  Union  and  Franklin 
County  lines.  That  section  was  then  very  heavily 
timbered,  the  forests  abounding  in  much  line  poplar. 

Hanson  Steele  and  John  Mcllwain,  related,  emi- 
grated from  Abbeyville  District,  S.  C,  in  1813,  and 
either  one  or  both  stopped  one  season  in  the  vicinity 
of  Fairfield,  Franklin  County,  where  one  crop  was 
raised;  then  they  settled  on  laud  above  designated. 

Robert  T.  and  David  Taylor,  brothers,  came  from 
Laurens  District,  S.  C,  about  1814,  and  settled  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  other  South  Carolinans. 

John  Jamison,  from  Mason  County  Ky.,  settled  on 
his  possessions  in  1814  or  1815.  He  carried  on  a 
tan-yard  for  many  years.    His  death  occurred  in  1851. 

William  Beckett,  a  native  of  Ireland,  emigrated 
to  the  township  in  1814,  coming  from  Butler  County, 
Ohio. 

James  Morrow,  from  North  Carolina,  and  John 
Milliner,  from  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  effected  settle- 
ments here  ia  1815. 

Samuel  Logan  and  Alexander  Sims  were  from 
Abbeyville  District,  S.  C,  and  Elijah  Corbin  was 
from  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  though  born  in  Virginia, 
and  settled  in  the  township  in  1813. 


The  year  following  came  John  Williams  from 
Pulaski  County,  Ky. ,  and  settled  upon  land  now  occu- 
pied by  his  venerable  son.  Rev.  Elisha  Williams. 

John  Baker,  of  the  same  neighborhood,  was  from 
Kentucky. 

Leonard  Lewis  in  1815  settled  in  Franklin  County, 
coming  from  the  State  of  Kentucky,  and  two  years 
later  settled  on  Bear  Creek  on  the  farm  where  his  son 
Enoch  now  resides. 

Jonathan  Wright  emigi-ated  from  Maryland  to 
Eli's  Creek  in  1818. 

William  Arnett  from  Virginia  and  C.  Harrell  from 
Kentucky  settled  in  the  township  about  1819. 

Joel  Belk  from  South  Carolina  settled  in  the 
vicinity  of  Fairfield  in  Franklin  County  in  1810,  and 
some  years  subsequent  removed  to  a  tract  of  land 
some  two  and  a  half  miles  southeast  of  Everton. 

Jesse  Ward  and  family  from  Bracken  County,  Ky., 
settled  in  the  vicinity  of  Eli's  Creek  about  1822  or 
1823,  and  subsequently  entered  the  land  on  Bear 
Creek  heretofore  referred  to.  He  was  the  father  of 
Gen.  Durbin  Ward,  of  Ohio,  and  Alfred  Ward,  a 
promising  young  lawyer  who  settled  at  Brookville 
and  died  many  years  ago;  and  also  of  Maj.  Augustus 
Ward,  who  left  Miami  University  and  went  into  the 
Union  Army  before  he  was  seventeen  years  old  and 
rose  to  be  Major  at  twenty.  He  afterward  studied 
law  at  Columbian  College,  Washington,  D.  C,  and 
after  admission  was  appointed  clerk  in  the  office  of 
Hon.  William  M.  Everts,  then  Attorney-General  of 
the  United  States.  From  there  he  was  appointed 
Assistant  United  States  Attorney  at  Cincinnati,  and 
then  elected  to  the  Ohio  Legislature  from  that  city  in 
1869,  and  died  a  member  of  that  body  in  1871. 
Both  parents  passed  the  remainder  of  their  lives  in 
the  township,  and  have  long  since  been  called  to  their 
reward. 

James  Kerr,  a  native  of  the  County  of  Antrim, 
Ireland,  settled  in  Abbeyville  District,  S.  C,  in  1800 
and  in  1822  removed  to  Indiana  and  in  1824  to  the 
vicinity  of  Everton,  where  he  died  in  1873. 

In  about  1823  John  Lambert  from  Ohio  settled 
at  Everton.  He  served  in  the  war  of  1812,  and  his 
wife  Nancy,  who  died  at  the  age  of  ninety-five  years, 
was  reared  among  the  frontier  scenes  of  early  Ken- 
tucky, though  by  birth  a  Pennsylvanian. 

Robert  Hood,  still  a  resident  of  the  township,  was 
born  in  Pennsylvania  in  1790,  removed  to  Kentucky 
in  1807,  served  in  the  war  of  1812,  and  was  at  the 
memorable  battle  of  the  Thames  River,  and  there 
received  a  wound  in  one  of  his  limbs.  In  1819  he 
was  married  and  removed  to  this  county. 

Besides  those  noted  under  the  above  head  as  act- 
ual settlers  the  following  named  had  become  residents 
of   the   township  prior  to    1826:  Noble    Ladd,    Sr.,

INDUSTRIES. 

During  the  period  in  which  copper  stills  were  in 
nse,  such  are  remembered  as  being  in  operation  on  the 
farms  of  John  and  Charles  Salyers,  on  the  John 
Baker  farm,  and  on  the  William  Arnett  place. 

John  Jemison  began  tanning  soon  after  his  arrival, 
which  business  he  carried  on  for  probably  a  quarter 
of  a  century.  In  the  Beckett  neighborhood  William 
Evans  operated  a  tannery  in  an  early  day.  Eli's 
Creek  was  a  great  mill  stream  in  an  early  day.  The 
first  grist  mill  of  the  township  was  erected  on  the 
site  of  the  present  Elisha  Cockefair  mill  on  that  stream 
in  the  year  1816,  by  Dr.  Johnson.  From  the  Doctor 
the  site  is  believed  to  have  passed  into  the  hands  of 
Jonathan  Wright,  who,  some  years  subsequently, 
erected  what  is  known  as  the  Cockefair  mill.  In 
1818  Jonathan  Wright  built  the  first  saw-mill  in  the 
eastern  part  of  the  township.  This  stood  about  a  half 
mile  east  of  the  grist-mill,  and  was  on  the  line  sepa- 
rating the  counties  of  Fayette  and  Union.  The  Cocke- 
fair mill  has  been  in  that  name  ever  since  it  passed 
from  the  hands  of  Mr.  Wright  to  Elisha  Cockefair, 
Sr. ,  which  was  many  years  ago. 

Between  the  grist  and  saw-mill  Zacheus  Stanton 
biiilt  a  carding-machine,  and  in  connection  with  it 
had  a  hominy  mill,  both  of  which,  not  far  from  the 
year  1848,  were  sold  to  Elisha  Cockefair,  Sr. ,  who 
converted  them  into  a  looking-glass  factory,  which 
was  in  operation  for  several  years. 

Not  far  from  1846  Wilson  Adams  built  a  saw-mill 
and  pump  factory  about  half  a  mile  above  the  grist- 
mill, which  has  ever  since  been  carried  on  in  the 
Adams  name.  This  has  been  quite  an  enterprise,  and 
an  extensive  business  in  the  pump  line  has  been  done. 

Sanford  Keeler  built  a  grist-mill  very  early 
on   Bear   Creek   about   a   mile  from  its  mouth.     It 


was  subsequently  operated  by  Rev.  Joseph  Williams 
and  by  John  Lambert.  Some  distance  north  of 
this  mill  was  built  a  saw-mill  by  Charles  Malone, 
and  was  owned  later  by  James  Conwell.  Some 
time  after  this  fell  into  disuse,  and,  perhaps,  not 
far  from  1842,  another  saw-mill  was  built  on  the 
South  Fork  of  Bear  Creek  by  E.  R.  Lake,  who  subse- 
quently sold  it  to  Wilson  Adams,  who  built  the  second 
pump  establishment  in  the  township.  Mr.  Adams 
also  put  up  a  pair  of  buhrs,  and  had  a  little  corn- 
cracker  in  connection  with  it. 

On  the  West  Fork  of  Whitewater,  some  two  miles 
north  of  the  mouth  of  Boar  Creek,  was  the  Morgan 
Vardiman  grist-mill,  which  was  built  quite  early.  It 
was  in  operation  in  1829. 

EARLY    SCHOOLS. 

Among  the  first  built  schoolhouses  and  cabins  in 
which  school  was  taught  in  the  township  may  be 
mentioned  one  that  stood  northeast  of  Everton  in 
Section  21.  Here  John  Lee  is  thought  to  have  taught 
a  three  months'  school  prior  to  1817.  Andrew  Lewis 
and  Lot  Green  are  also  remembered  as  teachers  in 
this  house. 

The  next  schoolhouse  for  this  settlement  was  built 
in  Section  26,  Township  13,  Range  13,  on  the  Obe- 
diah  Estis  land.  Lot  Green  is  thought  to  have  con- 
ducted the  first  school  in  this  building.  In  the  old 
log  meeting-house  that  stood  at  the  grave-yard  on 
Poplar  Ridge,  and  for  a  number  of  years  served  the 
Friends  as  their  place  of  worship,  school  was  some- 
times held.  One  Thomas  O'Brien,  an  Irishman  of 
considerable  learning,  taught  quite  a  period  in  the 
schools  of  this  settlement,  and  among  his  pupils 
were  the  Wards,  the  Wrights,  the  Truslers,  the  Beck- 
etts,  the  Stantons,  and  many  others,  some  of  whom 
became  distinguished  in  both  State  and  national 
affairs. 

In  1816  or  1817  a  school  was  taught  in  a  vacated 
cabin  that  stood  about  one  mile  south  of  the  present 
residence  of  jRev. Elisha  Williams  in  Section  19  by 
David  Sloan.  Soon  after  this  a  regular  log  school- 
house  was  built  about  one  mile  further  south, in  which 
the  first  teacher  was  Joseph  Moore;  William  Silvey 
also  taught  in  this  house. 

About  1822  a  log  schoolhouse  was  built  in  Sec- 
tion 24,  between  two  and  three  miles  west  of  Ever- 
ton. Robert  Cathers,  Robert  Willis  and  William 
Eskew  were  early  teachers  here.  A  little  later  an- 
other schoolhouse  was  built  in  Section  30  on  the 
north  fork  of  Bear  Creek,  in  which  for  a  time  John 
Gunn  was  the  teacher. 

In  1827  or  1828  school  was  taught  in  a  cabin 
which  had  been  previously  occupied  as  a  dwelling, 
that  stood  in  Section  12   in  the  northwestern  part  of

the  township,  by  Travis  Silvey.  About  this  time  a 
rude  round-log  schoolhouse  was  standing  just  east  of 
Mount  Zion  meeting-house  constructed  of  beech 
timber.  This  school  was  quite  large,  being  attended 
by  scholars  coming  from  miles  around.  John  Barnes 
was  the  teacher  about  the  year  1829,  and  is  remem- 
bered as  having  been  "barred  out."  The  boys  after 
being  satisfied  that  he  could  not  make  an  entrance, 
and  Barnes  himself  being  of  that  mind  after  makincr 
several  tremendous  ofiforts  with  a  large  timber  which 
was  used  as  a  battering-ram,  agreed  upon  a  com- 
promise suggested  by  a  writing  the  boys  slipped 
through  to  the  efieet  that  Daddy  Baker,  who  lived 
close  by,  had  a  good  store  of  winter  apples  and  that 
if  going  for  a  bushel  was  any  object  the  barricade 
would  be  removed.  Suffice  it  by  saying  that  the  apples 
were  soon  forth-comin?. 

o 
THE  OLD  ROOK  AT    "pOPLAR  RIDGE." 

•  On  a  beautiful  afternoon  in  October,  1883,  as  the 
writer  was  strolling  through  the  woods  on  "Poplar 
Eidge"  drinking" in  the  beauties  of  nature  through 
the  mellow  light  of  the  hazy  autumnal  sun,  there  met 
his  eyes  a  large  irregular  stone  lying  in  a  gulley  at 
the  very  brink  of  a  murmuring  stream,  and  over- 
shadowed by  the  majestic  oak  and  towering  ash. 
Here  it  lay,  stern  rock  of  a  sterner  age,  half  imbedded 
in  the  accumulations  of  the  earth  of  centurie.s.  Upon 
inspecting  it  closely  we  observed  the  figures  1838, 
which  excited  our  curiosity  and  led  to  an  investiga- 
tion and  later  on  to  a  soliloquy.  Suffice  it  to  say 
that  upon  tearing  from  its  surface  the  clinging  moss 
and  removing  the  earth  from  its  sides  and  base  as 
best  we  were  able,  the  following  inscription  was 
revealed:

It  occurred  to  our  mind  that  formerly,  and  at  the 
time   of  the  execution  of  this  work,  this  monument, 
dedicated  to  the  ties  of  friendship  and  the  associations 
of  schoolboy  days  clustering  around  the  old  "Quaker 
log    meeting     and   schoolhouse"    that    stood  a    few 
hundred  yards  to  the  south,  had    occupied  a  position 
on  the  apex  of  the  precipice  some  twenty-five  or  more 
feet  above,  and  had  either  at  the  hands  of  mischiev- 
ous boys,  or  by    the  gradual  and  constant    action  of 
nature,  been  thrown  to  the  gorge  beneath,   and  since 
been  8ufi"ered  to  remain  with  its  face  to  the  earth,  its

message,  freighted  with  the  warm  friendships  and  love 
of  youth  so  beautifully  wrought  by  the  chisel  of  an 
artist,  permitted  to  be  half  hidden  from  the  eyes  of 
hundreds  to  whom  the  memory  of  some  of  the  partic- 
ipants of  the  scene  is  sacred  and  dear,  as  they  have 
long  since  been  laid  away  in  the  church  yard.  Let 
the  old  stone  which  speaks  volumes  be  reared  again, 
that  generations  yet  unborn  may  scan  the  deeds  of 
their  forefathers,  gather  inspiration  therefrom,  and 
follow  after  in  their  illustrious  careers! 

Our  old  friend,  Gen.  Durbin  Ward,  of  Ohio,  to 
whom  this  little  tribute  is  more  especially  paid,  was 
a  participant  of  the  scenes  we  describe.  Inasmuch  as 
the  boyhood  of  this  distinguished  lawyer  and  soldier 
was  passed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  rock  we  have  pic- 
tured, and  the  bones  of  his  ancestors  rest  in  the  vil- 
lage grave-yard,  and  here  and  there  still  remain  a 
playmate  of  the  bygone  years,  we  deem  it  in  place  to 
briefly  review  his  career. 

Born  at  Augusta,  Ky.,  February  11,  1819,  of 
English  and  Welsh  extraction.  Gen.  Ward  with  his 
parents,  Jesse  Ward  and^Rebecca  (Patterson)  Ward, 
removed  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  when  about  four 
years  of  age.  The  General  most  likely  inherited  his 
soldiery  instinctsj'patriotism  and  love  of  country.  His 
father  and  grandfather  were  both  in  the  war  of  1812, 
and  his  mother  was  a  daughter  of  a  soldier  of  the 
same  war.  He  was  named  in  honor  of  Rev.  Dr. 
Durbin,  the  distinguished  Methodist  preacher,  who 
was  a  schoolmate  of  his  mother's.  His  early  oppor- 
tunities for  education  were  limited,  and  hard  strug- 
gles did  he  pass  through  ere  he  had  left  the  hills  of 
Fayette  County,  but  such  was  his  thirst  for  knowl- 
edge that  he  became  an  insatiable  reader,  and  when 
he  was  eighteen  years  old  he  had  read  every  book  he 
had  ever  seen.  He  has  never  lost  his  studious  hab- 
its, and  when  at  home  he  is  most  frequently  found 
in  his  library,  which  contains  the  largest  and  best 
selected  collection  of  books  of  the  private  libraries  of 
Lebanon.  After  spending  two  years  at  Miami  Uni- 
versity, where  he  supported  himself  by  his  own  exer- 
tions and  teaching  school  for  a  short  time  in  Warren 
County,  he  studied  law  at  Lebanon,  Ohio,  first  under 
the  direction  of  Judge  Smith  and  afterward  of  Gov. 
Corwin,  he  commenced  the  practice  at  Lebanon,  and 
was  for  three  years  a  partner  of  Gov.  Corwin.  In 
18-45  he  became  Prosecuting  Attorney  and  served  six 
years.  In  1852-53  he  was  a  representative  from 
Warren  County  in  the  first  Legislature  held  under  the 
present  constitution  of  Ohio.  Retiring  from  this 
office  he  devoted  himself  to  the  practice  of  the  law, 
and  established  an  office  at  Cincinnati,  where  he  has 
had  a  lucrative  practice.  He  retained  his  residence  at 
Lebanon.  About  1855  Mr.  W^ard  abandoned  the 
Whig   party,   which  was  then    near    its   dissolution.

Since  that  time  he  has  adhered  to  the  Democratic 
party.  He  was  the  Democratic  candidate  for  Congress 
in  1856,  and  for  Attorney-General  in  1858,  but  was 
defeated.  In  i860  he  supported  Douglas  for  Presi- 
dent. When  the  war  of  the  Rebellion  broke  out  he 
was,  as  is  claimed  for  him,  the  first  man  in  his  Con- 
gressional district  to  volunteer;  declining  a  Captaincy, 
he  enlisted  as  a  private.  He  was  Major  of  the 
Seventeenth  Ohio,  and  took  a  part  in  the  battles  of 
Mill  Springs,  Corinth,  Perryville,  Stone  River, 
Hoover's  Gap  and  Chickamauga.  At  the  last  named 
fight  he  was  shot  through  the  body,  and  his  left  arm 
was  disabled  for  life,  and  he  carried  it  in  a  sling 
through  the  Atlanta  Campaign.  Having  passed 
through  the  grades  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  and  Colonel, 
in  November,  1865,  he  was  brevetted  Brigadier-Gen- 
eral, "for  gallant  and  meritorious  conduct  at  the  bat- 
tle of  Chickamauga."  In  1866  he  was  appointed  by 
President  Johnson  United  States  District  Attorney 
for  the  Southern  District  of  Ohio,  and  in  1870  he 
was  elected  Senator  in  the  General  Assembly.  Since 
that  time  he  has  held  no  office,  and  devoted  himself 
to  the  practice  of  the  law.  Gen.  Ward  has  delivered 
many  orations  and  addresses,  and  he  ranks  among  the 
most  eloquent  campaign  orators  of  Ohio.  A  volume 
of  his  speeches  is  nearly  ready  for  the  press.  It  is 
only  justice  to  the  General  to  state  that  he  has  long 
lived  in  a  Congressional  district  that  has  hopelessly 
been,  in  the  lineof  his  politics,  in  the  minority,  or  he 
would  have  been  heard  from  in  Congress  years  ago. 
He  has  several  times  made  the  race,  but  as  often  suf- 
fered defeat.  At  the  Democratic  Convention  a  year 
ago,  held  in  the  city  of  Columbus,  he  was  a  formida- 
ble opponent  of  Judge  Hoadly  for  the  nomination 
for  Governor,  and  was  unquestionably  the  people's 
choice  for  that  high  office,  yet  on  the  very  eve  of  vic- 
tory he  lost  the  nomination.  He  was  before  the  last 
Legislature  of  his  State  a  candidate  for  the  office  of 
United  States  Senator,  but  in  the  contest  fell  with 
Thurman  and  Pendleton. 

CHURCHES  AND  GRAVE-TARDS. 

The  largest  buiying-ground  in  the  township  is  the 
one  at  Mt.  Zion  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  and  the 
first  interment  made  therein  was  the  body  of  Father 
Brock.  This  information  comes  from  the  Rev.  Elisha 
Williams,  who  was  born  in  1802,  and  with  his  father 
settled  in  that  vicinity  in  1816. 

Among  the  early  settlers  of  that  vicinity  who  were 
Methodists  in  their  religious  views  and  were  members 
of  the  class  or  society  that  worshiped  at  Mt.  Zion 
Church,  were  John  Plummer  and  wife,  Noble  Ladd 
and  wife,  Michael  Bash  and  wife,  John  Williams  and 
wife,  David  Williams  and  wife,  Miles  H.  Larimore 
and  wife,  the  Eskews  and  the  Silveys.     Mr.  Plummer 


deeded  two  acres  of  ground  where  the  grave-yard  and 
church  now  are  and  in  the  course  of  some  years  when 
it  became  necessary  to  extend  the  burying-ground  not 
quite  two  acres  more  adjoining  was  deeded  to  the 
Trustees  of  the  church  by  Basil  Roberts. 

The  first  meeting-house  was  built  of  hewed  logs 
when  Mr.  Williams  was  yet  a  boy,  and  stood  on  the 
site  of  the  present  frame  structure  known  as  Mt. 
Zion  Church.  The  old  meeting-house  was  heated  by 
burning  charcoal  and  was  itself  destroyed  by  tire 
some  (ime  subsequent  to  1836  and  replaced  by  the 
one  now  there,  which  was  built  by  Alfred  Shaw. 
Up  to  1835  Mt.  Zion  was  an  appointment  on  what 
was  known  as  the  Whitewater  Circuit,  which  at  one 
time  embraced  some  twenty  odd  preaching  places. 

Among  the  aged  whose  remains  were  here  interred 
and  whose  graves  are  marked  by  tombstones  are  the 
following- named:  Rev.  Thomas  Silvey,  aged  sixty 
years;  Anna,  his  wife,  eighty-three  years;  Miles  H. 
Larimore,  eighty-four  years;  Susan  Larimore,  sev- 
enty-four years;  Moses  Ladd,  eighty-eight  years; 
John  Mcllwain,  Sr.,  about  eighty-three  years;  Sarah, 
his  wife,  about  eighty-seven  years;  John  McCabe, 
sixty  years;  Noble  Ladd,  eighty-one  years;  Betty, 
his  wife,  eighty-nine  years;  John  Eagan,  eighty 
years;  John  Campbell,  eighty-five  years;  Mary,  his 
wife,  seventy- two  years;  William  Lake,  seventy-three 
years;  Elijah  Corbin,  eighty-two  years;  Michael 
Bash,  seventy-six  years;  John  Williams,  seventy-two 
years;  George  Talbott,  seventy-three  years;  Susan, 
his  wife,  seventy-four  years;  Sarah  Lewis,  eighty- 
nine  years;  James  Kerr,  eighty-one  years;  Anna 
Adams,  eighty  years;  Mary,  wife  of  Philip  Jones, 
eighty  years;  William  Eskew,  eighty  years;  David 
L.  Williams,  seventy-eight  years;  Nancy,  his  wife, 
eighty-seven  years. 

The  oldest  grave  marked  by  a  tombstone  is  that 
of  Nancy,  consort  of  Thomas  J.  Larimore,  who  died 
February  16,  1831. 

In  the  early  settlement  of  Fayette  and  Union 
Counties  many  of  the  pioneers  of  the  latter  were  of 
the  Friend  or  Quaker  element,  and  established  their 
meetings  soon  after  effecting  a  settlement.  Silver 
Creek  monthly  meeting  (Union  County)  was  estab- 
lished in  1817.  What  was  known  as  Poplar  Ridge 
meeting- hoiise  was  constructed  of  logs  and  stood  at 
the  little  burying-ground  still  known  by  that  name  in 
the  eastern  part  of  the  township  (Section  23)  and  was 
both  an  established  and  preparative  meeting  in  the 
early  history  of  Fayette  County,  but  was  '  'laid  down" 
many  years  ago,  and  the  building  removed,  which 
now  stands  on  Eli's  Creek,  in  Union  County,  and  is 
occupied  as  a  dwelling.  Among  the  early  resident 
ministers  of  the  Silver  Creek  monthly  meeting  (of 
which  Poplar  Ridge  constituted  a  part)  were  Susannah

HISTORY  OF  PAYETTE  COUNTY. 


HoUingBworth,  William  Haughton  and  Rebecca  and 
Sylvanus  Tnlbert. 

The  first  person  buried  in  this  grave-yard  is  said 
to  have  been  a  young  man  from  Ohio,  named  Ruff. 

What  is  known  as  the  Ireland  or  Mcllwain  grave- 
yard is  just  over  the  line  (in  Franklin)  separating  the 
two  counties,  but  in  it  rest  the  remains  of  a  number 
of  the  pioneers  of  southern  and  eastern  Fayette 
County.  The  first  interment  here  is  said  to  have 
been  the  remains  of  Hugh  E. ,  son  of  John  Waters. 

For  probably  a  quarter  of  a  century  preceding 
the  late  war  of  the  Rebellion,  there  existed  a  Method- 
ist congregation  which  worshiped  at  a  log  meeting- 
house that  occupied  the  ground  upon  which  the 
Lutheran  Church,  in  the  northern  part  of  the  town- 
ship, is  now  built,  which,  though  its  light  shone 
brightly  for  many  years,  went  out  in  the  manner  of 
deaths  and  removals.  The  ground  was  donated  by 
the  few  remaining  Methodists  shortly  prior  to  1863 
to  the  English  Lutheran  denomination,  who  com- 
pleted the  present  frame  church  building  there  in 
1865.  The  first  congregation  was  styled  the  Union 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  and  among  those  early 
identified  with  the  membership  were  Basil  Roberts 
and  wife,  Isaac  Updyke  and  wife,  P.  Silvey  and  wife, 
Nathan  Aldridge  and  wife,  George  Talbot  and  wife, 
Noah,  Amos  and  Nicholas  Pumphrey  and  wives. 

Concerning  the  history  of  the  present  Union 
Evangelical  Lutheran  Church,  the  pastor  (Rev.  S.  B. 
Hyman)  in  the  fall  of  1882  wrote: 

"As  early  as  1855  Rev.  J.  B.  Oliver,  then  pastor  of 
St.  Paul's  Evangelical  Lutheran  Church,  began  to 
preach  to  a  few  scattered  Lutherans  in  Jackson  Town- 
ship, and  preaching  has  been  continued  by  Rev.  O's 
successor  at  this  point  ever  since.  During  the 
ministry  of  F.  W.  Keeler  the  present  commodious 
and  excellent  building  was  erected,  and  received  its 
name  as  above  in  accordance  with  the  provision  of 
the  subscription.  An  organization  was  effected  in 
October,  1864,  with  seven  members.  This  seems  to 
have  been  the  most  prosperous  period  of  the  church's 
existence,  for  the  records  show  a  gradual  decline  by 
deaths  and  removals  frord  that  time  to  the  present." 

The  charge  is  now  without  a  pastor. 

There  is  a  burying-ground  within  the  church- 
yard enclosure,  but  few  interments  seem  to  have  been 
made  therein,  and  almost  isolated  and  alone  stands 
a  sandstone  slab,  revealing  to  the  passer-by  that  he 
who  sleepeth  beneath  the  green  mound  was  a  Revo- 
lutionary patriot,  and  seemingly  as,  perhaps,  at  Val- 
ley Forge  or  at  Yorktown  he  stood  a  lonely  sentinel 
for  the  living,  so  stands  the  brown  tombstone  of  the 
soldier  for  the  dead  at  the  church  yard.  The  stone 
is  inscribed  to  the  memory  of  James  Hamer,  died 
July  5,  1837,  aged  seventy-three  years. 

"  Soldier,  rest,  thy  warfare  's  o'er." 


The  Ireland  Universalist  Church,  located  in  the 
southeastern  part  of  the  township,  was  organized  in 
the  schoolhouse  of  the  same  name  in  November,  1868, 
by  Rev.  M.  G.  Mitchell,  of  Abington,  Ind.  The  first 
membership  was  composed  of  Milton  Trusler,  M. 
Annie  Trusler,  Laura  J.  Trusler,  James  and  Emma 
Sims,  John  Reagor,  Ada  Smith,  Thomas  and  Eliza- 
beth Curry,  Elnora  Taylor,  Ebenezer  Glenn,  James 
and  May  Smith,  some  of  whom  came  from  the  church 
at  Fairfield.  The  first  Trustees  were  Milton  Trusler, 
James  Smith  and  Thomas  Curry,  and  under  this  oQic  • 
iary  was  built,  in  1871,  the  present  neat  frame  church 
edifice  now  occupied  by  the  society.  It  was  dedicated 
on  Sabbath,  August  13,  1871,  Rev.  W.  W.  Curry 
preaching  the  dedicatory  sermon.  Rev.  D.  R.  Bid- 
dlecome,  of  Richmond,  also  was  present  and  officiated. 
The  pastors  of  the  church  and  in  the  order  given  have 
been  Revs.  M.  G.  Mitchel,  J.  B.  Grandy,  Frank 
Evans,  W.  S.  Bacon,  VV.  C.  Brooks,  R.  N.  John, 
William  Tucker,  May  T.  Clark  and  H.  A.  Merrell. 
Among  others  who  preached  for  the  church  for  short 
periods  have  been  Revs.  Case,  Crossly,  Caatwell, 
Biddlecome  and  McLean. 

At  Everton  stands  a  brick  church  that  was  built  by 
subscription  raised  in  and  about  that  neighborhood 
in  1844.  Among  those  contributing  largely  were 
Elisha  Cockefair,  J.  H.  Bonham,  James  Smith,  Aza- 
riah  Beckett,  R.  N.  Taylor,  Alexander  Cockefair, 
John  Rigor,  Mordacai  Miller,  David  Taylor,  Ezra 
Bonham  and  William  Rigsby.  We  understand  that 
it  was  not  built  for  any  particular  denomination,  but 
as  a  place  for  holding  worship  for  all  denominations, 
and  as  such  has  been  so  used.  Universalism  was 
quite  strong  at  one  time  in  that  section,  and  perhaps 
more  of  the  funds  obtained  for  its  construction  came 
from  those  holding  such  belief,  and  the  building, 
especially  in  its  earlier  history,  was  more  frequently 
used  by  that  society.  Revs.  Kaylor  and  Brooks  were 
among  the  earlier  ministers  of  the  Universalist  doc- 
trine who  officiated  in  this  building.  The  Methodists, 
not  far  from  the  same  period,  yet  a  little  in  advance, 
had  constructed  a  frame  building  in  the  same  village, 
which  they  used  until  both  congregation  and  building 
had  so  weakened  as  to  be  abandoned.  Probably  a 
decade,  or  some  longer  ago,  meetings  without  respect 
to  denomination  were  held  at  the  village,  which 
resulted  in  the  organization  of  a  regular  church  soci- 
ety, which  in  the  course  of  time  became  a  Methodist 
congregation,  and  as  such  has  been  holding  services 
in  the  brick  house  of  worship. 

On  the  south  fork  of  Bear  Creek  stands  a  little 
frame  house  of  worship,  known  as  the  Palestine 
Church,  which  in  denomination  is  United  Brethren. 
The  building  was  erected  some  ten  or  twelve  years 
ago;  services  had  for  a  period  previous  been  held  in 
the    neighboring   schoolhouse.     Among  the  number

constituting  the  early  membership  were  some  of  the 
Lakes,  Reeds,  Wrights  and  Sher woods.  The  congre-

EVERTON. 

This  village  is  situated  east  of  the  centre  of  the 
township  on  the  road  leading  from  Brookville  to  Con- 
nersville,  distant  about  seven  miles  fi'om  the  latter 
point.  It  lies  on  the  eastern  half  of  Section  21,  Town- 
ship 13,  Range  13,  which  land  was  purchased  of  the 
Government  by  William  Adams  and  Eli  Lee,  the 
former  purchasing  the  northern  half  August  24,  1813, 
and  the  latter  the  southern  half  January  31,  1812. 
The  oldest  inhabitant  fails  to  give  any  definite  or  satis- 
factory information  as  to  the  origin  of  the  place,  and 
as  no  plat  seems  to  have  been  recorded  prior  to  1836, 
the  reader  is  left  to  conjecture.  Maria  Haughton, 
December  23  of  that  year,  acknowledged  twelve  lots 
addition  to  West  Union  (south  of  South  Street).  It 
is  said  that  it  originally  was  styled  Lawstown  or  Laws- 
burg.  Next  it  became  known  as  West  Union,  and  in 
March,  1856,  the  Commissioners  of  the  county 
ordered  ' '  that  the  name  of  the  town  of  West  Union 
be  changed  to  that  of  Everton,  which  was  the  name 
of  the  postofiBce." 

From  the  beginning  of  the  village  as  a  place  of 
business  to  184:0,  the  Commissioners  granted  license 
to  the  following-named,  to  vend  merchandise,  keep 
tavern,  sell  liquor,  or  all: 

1828 — Thomas  J.  Larimore  and  Miles  H.  Lari- 
more,  merchants. 

1829 — Maria  Haughton,  merchant;  Thomas  A. 
Thorn,  tavern. 

1832 — Thomas  A.  Thorn,  tavern  and  liquor;  Will- 
iam Beckett  and  Robert  Taylor,  groceries  and  liquor. 

1834 — Isaac  T.  Riggs,  tavern  and  liquor. 

1836 — Frederick  A.  Curtis,  tavern  and  liquor. 

1838 — Hugh  Morrow,  tavern  and  liquor. 

Some  of  the  above  licenses  were  renewed  for  sev- 
eral consecutive  years. 

January  20,  1841,  the  village  was  incorpor- 
ated and  divided  into  five  wards.  William  H.  Evans 
was  made  President,  and  R.  N.  Taylor  Village  Clerk. 
According  to  the  United  States  census  of  1860,  the 
place  then  numbered  239  souls,  and  a  decade  later  the 
census  gave  it  a  population  of  but  149. 

ISnEPENnENCE    DAY,   1836. 

Fourth  of  July,  1836,  was  observed  by  the  citi- 
zens of  the  village  and  county  by  a  large  celebration 
held  in  a  beautiful  grove  of  timber  near  the  village. 
The  procession  was  formed  at  10  o'clock  A.  M.,  under 
the  superintendence  of  Capt.  Thomas  Waters,  Mar- 
shal, and  John  Craig  and  Daniel  Moore,  Assistants. 


It  marched  to  the  grove,  where  the  solemnities  of  the 
day  commenced.  The  procession  was  headed  by  the 
following-named  four  venerable  Revolutionary  sol- 
diers: Messrs.  Lowe,  Logan,  Benetield  and  Fordyce. 
These  venerable  patriots  were  escorted  to  the  stand 
on  reaching  the  grove  by  J.  D.  Thompson,  the  Presi 
dent  of  the  day.  A  picture  (nearly  as  large  as  life) 
of  him  who  was  "  first  in  the  hearts  of  his  country- 
men" was  carried  in  front,  accompanied  by  the 
national  banner,  each  borne  by  one  of  the  Revolu- 
tionary soldiers;  imjnediately  after  came  the  names 
of  the  States  carried  on  elevated  placards  by  young 
ladies  in  white  dresses  and  ornamented  exactly  alike. 
At  the  grove  the  exercises  were  opened  by  prayer  and 
remarks  by  William  D.  Hubbartt.  Next  was  read 
the  Declaration  of  Independence  by  John  Ritchie; 
then  was  delivered  an  oration  by  William  Cook.  A 
big  dinner  was  next  in  order,  which  was  prepared  by 
L.  Stanley  and  J.  M.  Mcllwain,  and  at  which  the 
customary  toasts  were  drank.  There  were  about 
2,000  people  present. 

Everton  has  now  two  stores,  a  postoffice,  three 
blacksmith  shops,  a  good  hotel,  one  shop  for  wagon- 
making,  one  physician,  one  church,  a  schoolhouse 
(both  good  substantial  buildings),  one  sawmill,  and 
a  population  (estimated)  of  200  people. 

Everton  Lodge,  No.  139,  I.  O.  O.  F.,  was  institu- 
ted January  11,  1854,  by  Wilson  T.  Dale,  and  the 
following-named  officers  were  elected  and  installed 
under  the  same  date: 

James  Elliott,  N.  G.;  David  H.  Case,  V.  G.;  John 
T.  Williams,  Secretary;  William  Williams,  Treasurer. 
The  charter  was  granted  by  the  Grand  Lodge, 
January  18,  1854,  there  being  ten  charter  members, 
which,  excepting  the  officers  above  named,  were: 
Alfred  H.  and  Edward  J.  Thompson,  Elijah  Johnson, 
J.  H.  Debolt,  I.  L.  Case  and  Robert  T.  Taylor.  The 
Lodge  has  a  neat  hall  which  was  erected  in  1853, 
and  dedicated  October  19,  1854,  the  address  being 
delivered  by  the  late  Hon.  O.  P.  Morton,  then  G.  M.

VILLAGE— CHURCHES— SPRINGERVILLE— HALF-CENTURY  CITIZENS. 


"TTTATERLOO  TOWNSHIP  was  formed  by  the 
V  V  County  Commissioners  at  their  February  ses-

Brownsville  Townships,  as  follows:  "All  that  part  of 
Harrison  Township  which  lies  east  of  West  Fork  of 
Whitewater  River  be  attached  to  and  form  a  part  of 
a  new  township  to  consist  also  of  all  the  balance  of 
Brownsville  Township  which  remains  in  Fayette 
County  after  the  establishment  of  Union  County, 
making  the  Union  County  line  the  eastern  boundary 
of  said  new  township,  which  new  township  shall  be 
styled  Waterloo  Township." 

All  of  the  territory  of  the  township  as  it  now  is 
which  lies  east  of  a  line  parallel  to  the  eastern  bound- 
ary of  Jennings  Township  was  taken  from  Brownsville 
Township,  and  the  rest  from  Harrison.  In  position 
it  is  the  northeastern  township  of  the  county,  Wayne 
County  lying  north  of  it,  Qnion  east,  Jennings  and 
Cohuersville  Townships  south,  and  the  West  Fork  of 
Whitewater  River  west.  It  is  a  small  subdivison 
having  an  area  of  a  little  more  than  sixteen  square 
miles.  The  face  of  the  country  is  rolling.  Its  prin- 
cipal streams  are  West  Fork  and  Nolan's  Fork;  both 
are  on  its  western  border.  Simpson's  and  Williams 
Creeks— small  streams^drain  portions  of  the  land. 
The  extreme  southeastern  portion  of  the  township  is 
crossed  by  the  C.  H.  &amp;  I.  R.  R.,  and  within  its  con- 
fines are  situated  the  hamlet  of  Waterloo  and  the 
major  part  of  the  hamlet- of  Springerville.

engaged  in  plowing  or  otherwise  tending  corn  was 
quietly  captured  by  two  Indians,  and  himself  and 
the  horse  borne  away.  He  remained  in  captivity 
with  the  Indians  for  many  years,  and  in  their  journeys 
had  been  to  this  region  of  country  when  it  was  yet 
the  red  man's  home  and  formed  part  of  his  posses- 
sions. The  chief,  or  the  one  of  authority  under 
whose  care  and  charge  Mr.  Dawson  had  been  reared, 
it  is  said,  promised  him  the  land  he  subsequently 
had  to  purchase  of  the  Government  (in  the  vicinity 
of  Waterloo).  Mr.  Dawson,  after  the  battle  of  Fort 
Wayne,  was  released,  and  then  settled  on  his  posses- 
sions, which  he  improved,  living  here  for  a  number  of 
years,  when  he  removed  to  St.  Joseph  County,  this 
State,  and  there  closed  his  life.

thereafter  settled  on  the  south  half  of  the  southwest 
quarter  of  Section  33.  He  died  in  Waterloo  Town- 
ship in  1832,  aged  sixty  five  years.  He  was  the 
father  of  William  Roysdon,  deceased,  and  the  grand- 
father of  Stephen  and  John  H.,  of  this  county. 

Jonathan  Coleman,  too,  came  from  Ohio  here. 

Samuel  C.  Vance  was  a  Pennsylvanian.  He  im- 
proved the  land  he  entered  and  lived  and  died  upon  it. 

The  Hardins  and  Grewells   were  actual   settlers 

and  resided  in  the  northern  part  of  the  township  near 

the  Wayne  County  line.

1813  had  a  child  stolen  by  the  Indians. 

The  Heatons,  Ebenezer  and  Daniel,  were  related 
and  came  here  from  Warren  County,  Ohio,  settling 
upon  their  lands  about  the  year  1814.  Both  im- 
proved their  entries,  Ebenezer  passing  his  life  here, 
while  Daniel,  after  remaining  here  for  years,  removed 
further  west,  stopping  for  a  period  in  Hamilton 
County,  thence  removed  to  Howard  County,  this  State. 

Joseph  White,  the  father  of  the  venerable  D.  H. 
White,  of  the  township,  in  the  very  beginning  of 
the  century  started  on  foot  from  the  State  of  Mary- 
land and  journeyed  to  the  county  of  Warren,  Ohio, 
where  he  made  a  purchase  of  a  sixty-acre  tract  of 
land,  which  he  sold  during  the  war  of  1812,  in  which 
he  had  been  drafted,  to  pay  for  a  substitute.  In  the 
fall  of  1814  he  moved  his  family  to  the  present  site 
of  the  son  above  referred  to,  where  his  remaining 
years  were  passed. 

Abraham  Vanmeter  settled  quite  early,  coming  here 
from  Ohio.  John  M.  Layson  was  from  Kentucky  here. 
The  Parlows  were  from  Randolph  County,  N.  C,  and

where  a  number  of  their  descendants  now  reside.    In 

1814  Benjamin  Dungan  and  family  settled  in  the 
township  and  entered  land,  and  at  the  same  time  his 
brother  Isaac  settled  on  a  part  of  the  land.  They 
were  natives  of  Virginia.  B.  F.  Dungan,  now  of 
this  township,  is  a  son  of  Benjamin. 

Archibald  Reed  was  an  early  settler,  coming  from 
North  Carolina.  He  removed  to  Connersville,  where

Rumbley)  was  from  the  State  of  North  Carolina- 
Subsequently  he  sold  his  entry  to  Erwin  Boyd,  who 
came  from  Kentucky,  purchased  land,  returned,  and 
while  en  route,  bringing  his  family,  was  taken  sick 
and  died.  The  widow,  Sarah  Boyd,  with  several 
children,  settled  on  the  land  in  1822.  Mrs.  D.  H. 
White  was  a  daughter.  Joshua  Simpson  was  a  Caro- 
linan. 

Of  those  entering  land,  and  whose  date  of  settle- 
ment is  not  given  under  the  above  head,  William  Hiers, 
Henry  Holland,  John  Sleeth,  Abraham  Vanmeter  and 
James  Rumilley  all  were  residents  of  what  is  now  the 
township  in  1819. 

Daniel  Fiant  emigrated  from  Berks  County,  Penn., 
and  about  the  year  1816  settled  in  what  is  now  Union

couuty.  His  death  occurred  near  Waterloo  in  1866, 
aged  eighty-six  years.  His  wife  Saloma  died  one 
year  later  in  her  eighty  sixth  year. 

Capt.    James    Hamilton,    a    native   of  Maryland, 


though  subsequently  a  Virginian,  was  a  resident  of 
the  township  many  years.  In  the  war  of  1812  he 
served  in  the  Eighteenth  Regiment,  Heavy  Artillery 
Regulars.  He  reared  a  large  family,  and  his  death 
occurred  in  1878. 

John  Hubbell,  Sr. ,  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  at  the 
age  of  eight  years,  with  parents,  settled  in  Pennsyl- 
vania, and  subsequently  removed  to  Butler  County, 
Ohio,  where  John  was  married,  and  in  1817  located  in 
this  township,  where  he  resided  during  the  remainder 
of  his  life.  The  father,  John,  Sr.,  was  a  Revolution- 
ary soldier. 

Daniel  Skinner,  a  son  of  a  Revolutionary  soldier, 
a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  settled  in  the  township  in 
1819,  upon  land  where  a  son,  William  R.,  now  resides. 
He  was  chosen  the  first  Justice  of  the  Peace  of  the 
township,  which  office  he  held  for  sixteen  years. 

Josiah  Lambert,  a  native  of  Virginia,  with  family 
located  at  Columbia,  while  yet  Ohio  was  a  Territory; 
subsequently  he  removed  to  Warren  County,  Ohio, 
where  Clayton,  a  son  (now  a  resident  of  this  town- 
ship), was  born  in  1802.  In  1822  Clayton  settled  on 
the  land  where  he  now  resides. 

Robert  Holland,  a  native  of  Ireland,  emigrated  to 
America  in  1816;  subsequently  located  in  Hamilton 
County,  Ohio,  and  in  1822  settled  in  this  township. 
His  death  occurred  in  1857.  He  was  the  father  of 
Robert  and  William  A.  Holland,  now  residents  of  the 
township. 

In  1821  William  C.  Jones,  a  native  of  Maryland, 
settled  in  this  county.     His  death  occurred  in  1881. 

About  the  year  1820  Henry  Henry,  a  native  of 
Ireland,  but  from  Pennsylvania  here,  settled  in  the 
township.     His  death  occurred  in  1859. 

In  1825  Daniel  Kline,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania, 
with  family  settled  in  the  township.  He  was  the 
father  of  Benjamin  Kline,  of  this  county. 

About  the  year  1810  or  1811  William  McGraw,  a 
native  of  Bourbon  County,  Ky.,  settled  on  a  portion 
of  Section  33.  He  removed  to  Hancock  County,  this 
State,  in  1858,  and  there  died  in  1874. 

In  1817  William  Hart,  a  native  of  New  York, 
though  from  Pennsylvania  here,  located  in  the  town- 
ship. Later  he  assisted  in  clearing  ofif  the  timber 
from  the  site  of  the  city  of  Indianapolis.

SCHOOLS. 

In  Section  10  there  stood  one  of  the  earliest  built 
schoolhouses  in  the  township.  It  was  erected  in 
time  for  the  winter  school  of  1815,  and  the  first  mas- 
ter in  it  is  thought  to  have  been  Elijah  Holland.  A 
Mr.  Taylor  and  Absalom  Heaton  taught  in  this  house 
or  in  another  erected  a  little  later,  in  Section  17,  prob- 
ably a  mile  southwest  of  the  Daniel  H.  White  farm. 
The  latter  two  teachers  are  remembered  as  having 
taught  in  the  last  mentioned  building,  which  may 
have  been  only  a  cabin  vacated  by  some  family,  and 
not  built  for  school  purposes,  yet  it  was  so  used.  The 
former  building  was  not  occupied  long,  and  possibly 
Heaton  and  Taylor  held  no  school  there.  In  the 
south  part  of  the  township  later  teachers,  but  very 
early,  were  one  Hardin  and  Alexander  Wilson. 
Not  far  from  1821  a  regularly  built  frame  school- 
house  stood  near  the  river,  in  the  northwestern  part 
of  the  township,  in  which  at  this  time  school  was 
held  by  an  Irishman  by  the  name  of  Gray.  Probably 
in  1827  or  thereabouts  the  frame  building  heretofore 
referred  to  as  standing  in  the  grave-yard  at  Springer- 
ville  was  built  and  occupied  as  a  schoolhouse. 

The  condition  of  the  schools  of  the  township  in 
1879  is  exhibited  in  the  following  report  of  the  Su- 
perintendent for  that  year: 

"The  interests  of  the  educational  affairs  of  the 
township  are  managed  by  B.  F.  Dungan,  who  also 
has  the  experience  of  a  previous  term.  Foiu-  school- 
houses,  taking  them  as  a  township,  are  the  best  in 
the  county — well  an-anged,  large  and  commodious. 
Educational  matters  are  looking  up  in  this  township; 
but  it  is  in  need  of  some  fencing,  shade-trees  and 
well  fixtures.  This  latter  all  townships  are  in  need 
of,  as  the  health  of  the  pupils  is  of  first  importance. 
I  would  recommend  that  the  wells  and  springs  be  well 
cared  for,  and  that  they  be  within  the  school  grounds 
if  possible.       The  platform  of    wells   should    be  of 


stone  rather  than  boards.  A  previous  Trustee  built 
the  houses,  and  left  them  in  good  order.  Number  of 
males,  149;  females,  113;  total,  202." 


WATERLOO    VILLAGE. 


Waterloo  is  situated  in  the  northwestern  part  of 
the  township  on  the  east  bank  of  Nolan's  Fork — the 
hamlet  consisting  of  a  few  dwelling-houses  only  with 
one  industry — a  blacksmith  shop.  A  plat  of  the  place 
was  recorded  October  28,  1841.  Among  those 
licensed  in  its  earlier  history  as  merchants,  hotel- 
keepers,  etc.,  by  the  County  Commissioners  were: 
William  Port  as  a  merchant  in  1825,  and  later  as  a 
merchant  and  grocer;  Joseph  Flint  as  grocer  and  liq- 
uor dealer  in  1829;  Robert  Scott  and  Louis  Beaks  as 
the  same  in  1830;  John  M.  Turner  as  a  tavern-keeper 
and  liquor  dealer  in  1837.  Some  of  these  licenses 
were  renewed  yearly  for  quite  a  period — William 
Port's  especially.  For  a  time  the  people,  it  seems, 
were  of  the  opinion  that  too  much  liquor  was  being 
sold,  and  in  1830  the  Commissioners  when  granting 
license  issued  no  liquor  license  in  Waterloo  Town- 
ship. 

In  1839  or  thereabouts  Drs.  Richardson  and 
Chapman  were  the  physicians  of  the  village,  Reuben 
Hawkins  and  Isaac  Kline  were  the  blacksmiths,  and 
Joseph  Forrey  inn-keeper  (Eagle  House).  Not  far 
from  this  period  Dr.  Richardson  built  a  sawmill  on 
Nolan's  Fork,  which  was  then  in  operation.  This  was 
subsequently  owned  by  John  Grewell  and  still  later  ,  ^ 
by  John  Troxell,  in  whose  hands  it  fell  into  disuse. 
Nearly  sixty  years  ago  Waterloo  was  a  Methodist 
preaching  place  on  the  old  Whitewater  Circuit.  Prior 
to  the  war  of  the  Rebellion  there  was  built  at  Water- 
loo a  frame  church  by  subscription,  in  which  all  de- 
nominations were  to  hold  worship.  It  was  probably 
used  more  frequently  by  the  United  Brethren  Society. 
All  religious  societies  there  have  long  since  passed 
into  history,  there  being  no  church  building  or  or- 
ganization now  in  the  village. 

On  the  night  of  May  14,  1883,  Waterloo  was  visit- 
ed by  a  terrible  storm,  concerning  which  we  quote 
from  one  of  the  county  papers:  "  The  hamlet  of  Wa- 
tei-loo  was  badly  damaged.  Only  three  buildings  were 
left  standing,  these  three  beiug  at  the  north  end  of 
the  one  street  the  place  afforded.  Every  other  build- 
ing, barn  or  dwelling,  was  either  roofless  or  totally 
destroyed.  The  place  contained  about  100  inhabitants, 
about  seventy-five  of  whom  were  rendered  homeless, 
and  yet  but  one  person  wasinjttred,  and  he  slightly." 

CHURCHES. 

The  earliest  Methodist  class  or  society  in  the 
township,  and  among  the  first  in  the  county,  was  that 
out   of    which   grew   the    church    styled    Robinson's 


216 


HISTOEY   OF  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


Chapel.  This  chapel  building  is  a  large  frame, 
located  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  township,  and 
at  which  is  a  burying- ground  of  considerable  age. 
As  far  back  as  we  can  trace  the  history  of  the  origi- 
nal class  or  society,  it  was  an  appointment  along  with 
Waterloo,  a  class  at  John  Quinns,  Brownsville,  Bethel, 
Alquina.  Veatches  (Mt.  Garrison),  and  others  further 
south.  The  old  Whitewater  Circuit  was  formed  in 
1806  or  1807;  just  at  what  time  the  class  at  Robin- 
son's was  organized  or  first  visited  by  the  preachers  who 
traveled  the  circuit,  in  the  absence  of  records  we 
cannot  state,  but  it  was  some  years  before  the  forma- 
tion of  the  Connersville  Circuit  in  1822.  Sixty  years 
ago  the  village  of  Brownsville,  just  east  in  Union 
County,  was  among  the  most  flourishing  societies  on 
the  circuit;  the  preacher  often  lived  there.  A  meet- 
ing-house at  Robinson's  was  built  early;  we  find  a 
reference  to  it  in  the  decade  between  1820  and  1830. 
The  present  house  of  worship  there  was  built  in  1845. 
The  following  list  contains  the  names  of  some  of 
the  earlier  preachers  who  traveled  the  old  Whitewater 
Circuit  and  circuits  growing  out  of  it,  on  which  Rob- 
inson's was  an  appointment: 

1823,  Revs.  Bigelow  and  Gatch. 

1824,  Revs.  Everhart  and  White. 

1825,  Revs.  Stephens  and  Griffith. 

1826,  Revs.  Havens  and  Jones. 

1827,  Rev.  Havens.

1831,  Revs.  Tayler  and  Kimball. 

1832,  Revs.  McReynolds  and  Dailey. 

1833,  Revs.  Tarkington  and  Griss. 

1834,  Revs.  Bonner  and  Robins. 

1835,  Revs.  McReynolds  and  Harris.

1839,  Revs.  Beeks  and  Kelso. 

1840,  Revs.  Kiger  and  Landy  Havens. 

In  the  church -yard  sleep  many  of  the  pioneers  of 
Waterloo  Township  and  the  neighboring  country. 
One  of  the  earliest  graves  marked  by  a  tombstone 
upon  which  is  an  inscription  that  is  legible,  or  one  at 
all,  is  that  of  Catharine,  daughter  of  H.  and  M. 
Henry,  who  died  January  14,  1828,  aged  fourteen 
days. 

Among  the  remains  of  the  aged  resting  here  are 
those  of  William  McGraw,  who  died  in  1871,  aged 
eighty-three  years;  Martha,  his  wife,  died  in  1858, 
aged  fifty-nine  years;  David  Pearson,  died  in  1847, 
aged  sixty-seven  years;  Hannah,  his  wife,  died  in 
1867,  aged  eighty  years;  Jane  Ridgley,  died  in  1842, 
aged  about  ninety  years;  Elizabeth  Perry,  died  in 


1855,  aged  fifty-eight  years;  James  S.  Hamilton,  born 
in  1792,  died  in  1878;  Eliza,  his  wife,  born  in  1797, 
died  in  1872;  Matthew  Robinson,  died  in  1841,  aged 
sixty-one  years;  Eleanor,  his  wife,  died  in  1864,  aged 
eighty-one  years;  Thomas  Harbin,  died  in  1866, aged 
seventy-one  years;  Mary,  his  wife,  died  in  1868,  aged 
seventy-two  years;  Robert  Holland,  died  in  1857,  aged 
seventy-seven  years;  Margaret,  his  wife,died  in  1851, 
aged  sixty-three  years;  Daniel  Skinner,  died  in  1871, 
aged  ninety  years;  Nancy  A.,  his  wife,  died  in  1865, 
aged  eighty  years;  John  Thomas,  died  in  1866,  aged 
seventy-one  years;  John  M.  Layson,  died  in  1861, 
aged  seventy-six  years;  Sidney,  his  wife, died  in  1855, 
aged  sixty-four  years;  Catharine  Little,  died  in  1855, 
aged  eighty-six  years;  Henry  Henry,  died  in  1859, 
aged  eighty-two  years;  Margaret,  his  wife,  died  in 
1867,  aged  seventy-five  years. 

On  either  side  of  what  is  called  Four  Mile  Creek, 
in  eastern  Indiana  and  western  Ohio,  from  1804  to 
1808  settled  fourteen  families,  coming  principally 
from  the  States  of  Virginia  and  Pennsylvania.  These 
people  were  members  of  the  German  Baptist  Church 
before  their  emigration.  Elder  Jacob  Miller,  who 
is  thought  to  have  been  the  first  German  Baptist 
minister  who  preached  west  of  the  Great  Miami  River, 
came  occasionally  from  Bear  Creek,  in  Ohio,  and  here 
preached  for  this  membership,  which  was  organized 
by  him,  with  the  assistance  of  John  Hart  and  Mr. 
Bolton.  In  subsequent  years  the  church  increased  in 
numbers,  two  districts  were  formed  and  a  second 
meeting-house  was  erected  in  the  southern  part  of 
Union  County,  this  State.  Subsequently  a  member- 
ship was  formed  in  this  township,  among  whom  were 
John  Moyer,  Samuel  and  Elizabeth  McLinster, 
Salome  Fiant,  Sarah  Moyer,  Mrs.  Daniel  Fiant  (the 
first  member  of  this  denomination  in  the  community), 
Daniel  Jamiey  soon  after,  Susannah  Strong,  Cath- 
arine Priser,  Martin  Fiant,  Mrs.  Fiant,  John  Moss, 
Elizabeth  Dise,  Jonas  and  Mary  Fiant,  Samuel  and 
Catharine  Crick,  Ada  Simpson,  John  Fiant  and  wife 
Hannah,  Polly  McPherin,  Lewis  Paten  and  wife 
Elizabeth  and  Susannah  Ward. 

Their  house  of  worship,  a  frame  structure,  was 
built  in  1868,  the  building  committee  being  Jonas 
and  John  Fiant  and  Isaac  Pritchard.  Prior  to  the 
building  of  the  church  edifice,  meetings  were  held  in 
dwellings  and  in  barns.  Among  the  ministers  who 
have  served  the  charge  have  been  John  Moyer,  Will- 
iam Moss,  Abraham  Moss,  Daniel  Miller,  Daniel 
Brown  and  Jacob  Rife.  Preaching  is  held  once  in 
four  weeks.  Present  memberships  in  the  neighbor- 
hood of  fifty. 

8PKINGEEV1LLE. 

The  hamlet  of  Springerville  is  located  in  the 
southern  part  of  the  township,  on  the  road  leading

from  Connersville  to  Brownsville,  and  was  laid  out. 
by  Thomas  Simpson,  Jr.,  in  1840;  surveyed  August 
9  of  that  year,  by  William  Dickey. 

■  About  the  year  1838  the  frame  house  now  occu- 
pied by  Henry  Schriver  in  the  hamlet  was  built  by 
Thomas  Simpson,  Jr.,  in  which  the  postoffiee  and  a 
store  were  kept  by  Mr.  Simpson.  License  was 
granted  him  to  vend  merchandise  and  groceries  by  the 
County  Commissioners  in  January,  1839.  Probably 
ten  years  prior  to  this  goods  were  sold  in  that  local- 
ity by  William  McKimmey  (the  records  show  that 
William  A.  McKemmy  was  licensed  as  a  merchant  in 
the  county  in  January,  1835).  James  Culley  was  sub- 
sequently a  merchant  at  this  point.  Among  the 
blacksmiths  of  that  vicinity,  and  about  the  period  of 
which  we  are  writing,  were  John  Hoffy  and  Mortlo 
Bemington. 

The  ground  now  occupied  as  a  grave-yard  at 
Springerville  was  owned  in  a  very  early  day  by 
William  Dawson  (entered  by  Thomas  Dawson)  and 
the  first  burial  made  on  the  site  of  the  grave-yard 
was  a  small  child  of  Charles  Hubbartt,  which  was 
drowned  in  a  spring.  This  occurred  quite  soon  after 
the  settlement  of  that  vicinity.  This  tract  of  land 
was  in  subsequent  years  purchased  by  Thomas  Simp- 
son, Jr.,  and  although  public  burying  there  had  been 
made  for  years,  and  the  yard  was  in  the  hands  of 
Trustees,  no  deed  was  made  for  that  purpose  until 
after  Mr.  Simpson  became  possessor  of  the  land,  when 
he  deeded  a  half  acre  to  Charles  Hubbartt,  John 
Hubbell  and  Henry  Holland  as  Trustees  of  the  bury- 
ing-ground.  In  the  corner  of  the  grave-yard,  at 
about  this  time,  was  erected  the  little  frame  building, 
yet  standing  there,   for  a  schoolhouse,   church    and 


funeral  purposes,  on  ground  given  for  such  by 
Thomas  Simpson,  Jr. 

The  remains  of  many  the  old  citizens  and  pioneers 
lie  slumbering  here,  among  them: 

William  Walker,  Sr. ,  aged  eighty-two  years; 
Jane,  his  wife,  seventy-two;  Joseph  Felker,  sixty- 
eight;  Eve,  his  wife,  seventy -four;  Joseph  White, 
eighty-three;  Mary,  his  wife,  seventy-six;  Daniel

ORANGE  TOWNSHIP  was  organized  in  Febru 
ary,  1822.  It  is  situated  in  the  southwest  cor- 
ner of  the  county,  lying  south  of  Fairview  Township, 
west  of  Columbia  and  Connersville  Townships,  north 
of  Franklin  County,  and  east  of  Rush  County.  The 
territory  comprising  it  was  taken  from  Connersville 
and  Columbia  Townships,  and  at  its  formation  was  thus 
designated;  "Beginning  at  the  southwest  corner  of 
Fayette  County,  running  eastwardly  with  said  county 
line  three  miles  to  the  range  line;  thence  north  with 


the  said  range  line  to  the  northern  boundary  of  Con- 
nersville Township;  thence  we^.  with  the  said  town- 
ship line  to  the  county  line;  thence  south  with  said 
county  line  to  the  place  of  beginning." 

It  was  then  six  sections  larger  than  at  present. 
The  two  northern  tiers  of  sections  were  taken  from  it 
on  the  formation  of  F"'airview  Township  in  1851.

PIONEERS. 

The  beginning  of  immigration  to  the  lands  of 
Orange  Township  dates  from  about  the  year  1820. 
Little  knowledge  concerning  the  first  settlements  and 
those  making  them  can  be  gathered  at  this  late  day. 

Among  the  first  to  settle  in  the  township  was  the 
now  venerable  Wells  Stevens,  who,  at  this  writing,  is 
unconscious  to  the  things  of  this  world.  Mr.  Ste- 
vens is  a  North  Carolinan,  from  which  State  his 
father,  Robert,  emigrated  during  the  first  decade  of 
the  century  to  the  vicinity  of  the  settlements  of  the 
Carolina  colony  on  East  Fork  of  Whitewater  River. 
Robert  here  lived  in  the  vicinity  of  Templeton's 
Creek  until  the  close  of  the  war  of  1812,  and  during 
the  war  served  several  months  along  the  frontier  set- 
tlements. He  then  settled  on  Garrison's  Creek  in 
what  is  now  Columbia  Township. 

Wells,  possibly  in  1819,  but  probably  not  before 
1820,  then  just  married,  settled  in  the  southwest  cor- 
ner of  this  township,  and  began  the  work  of  the  early 
settler.  He  had  built  his  cabin  before  the  survey 
was  comjjleted,  and  in  it,  it  is  said,  he  entertained 
more  than  once  some  one  or  more  of  the  party 
engaged  in  making  the  survey.  Later,  Robert 
removed  to  that  vicinity  and  there  passed  his  life. 

Elias  B.  Stone,  emigrating  from  Kentucky  in 
about  the  year  1820,  settled  southeast  of  the  now 
village  of  Fayetteville  on  Garrison's  Creek,  and  some 
two  years  later  Silas  H.  Stone,  a  brother,  then  a 
young  and  single  man,  came  out  from  Lincoln  (now 


HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE    COUNTY. 


219 


Bojle)  County,  Ky.,  but  returned  to  Kentucky,  and 
again  came  out  in  1824  and  made  a  settlement. 

Adam  McNeill,  a  brother-in-law  to  Robert  Stevens, 
prior  to  1822  had  settled  in  the  Stevens  neighbor- 
hood on  Sain' 8  Creek. 

About  the  time  Robert  Stevens  made  his  settle- 
ment William  Pool  from  North  Carolina  located  in 
the  same  neighborhood. 

In  1821  George  Creelman,  a  native  of  the  County 
of  Antrim,  Ireland,  settled  where  his  son  W.  G.  now 
resides.  Mr.  Creelman  died  in  1880  at  the  advanced 
age  of  ninety-three  years. 

At  the  same  period  the  Dills  settled  here. 

In  1823  or  thereabouts  Ralph  Titsworth  and 
family,  from  Scott  County,  Ky.,  settled  probably  a 
mile  and  a  half  north  of  Fayetteville.  He  had  lived 
for  a  time  before  coming  in  Butler  County,  Ohio, 
and  before  settling  in  Kentucky,  in  the  State  of  New 
Jersey.  Mrs.  Squire  Daniel,  of  Fayetteville,  is  a 
daughter. 

Along  north  and  east  of  Fayetteville  during  the 
decade  between  1820  and  1830,  settled,  and  were 
living  there,  Hugh  Allen,  John  Russell  (who  cleared 
the  land  and  built  the  house  in  which  the  late  Robert 
Gamble  died),  Samuel  Hornady  (lived  where  Robert 
Martin  now  owns),  John  Coley,  James  Lathers  and 
a  Mr.  Perkins. 

Just  east  of  the  village  of  Fayetteville,  at  the 
period  above  referred  to,  there  lived,  on  what  will  be 
recognized  as  the  Dr.  Mason  farm,  Isaac  Thomas. 
Still  further  east  lived  a  Mr.  Jones  from  Kentucky, 
who  after  a  period  returned  to  that  State.  Still  east 
of  Jones  had  settled  Thuel  Wrightman  and  Henry 
Klum. 

In  1822  John  Scott,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania, 
entered  land  in  the  township  and  that  year  built  a 
cabin  upon  it,  and  removed  his  mother's  family 
thereto.  His  parents  when  he  was  small  emigrated 
to  the  vicinity  of  Brush  Creek  in  Adams  County, 
Ohio.  Here  the  father  died  and  left  a  large  family 
with  nothing.  The  son  John  traveled  the  river,  work- 
ing on  flat-boats  which  were  engaged  in  conveying 
salt  from  the  Kanawha  "Works  to  Cincinnati  and  to 
other  points,  and  traveled  the  Mississippi,  Kentucky 
and  other  rivers,  and  with  his  earnings  made  the 
purchase  referred  to.  He  served  as  one  of  the  Asso- 
ciate Judges  of  the  county  and  occupied  other  public 
positions. 

Henry  Dicken,  from  Kentucky,  and  Triplet  Lock- 
hart,  of  the  family  that  settled  early  in  Connersville 
Township,  were  among  the  pioneers  of  Orange;  also 
Joseph  Justice. 

Another  of  the  pioneers  on  Sain's  Creek  was  Cor- 
nelius Rinearson;  and  in  that  same  vicinity  located 
early  Laurence  Johnson. 


In  1826  Elias  Matney,  a  Kentuckian,  and  his 
father-in-law,  Alexander  Ayers,  settled  on  adjoining 
land  on  Sain's  Creek,  in  the  southeastern  part  of  the 
township.  They  were  from  Preble  County,  Ohio, 
here.  Ayers  had  emigrated  thither  from  Pennsylvania. 

Comparatively  speaking,  few  of  the  farms  in  this 
township,  it  is  said,  were  cleared  up  and  improved 
without  the  aid  of  leasers  or  renters  of  land,  concern- 
ing which  large  class  the  records  give  little  or  no  in- 
formation, and  as  many  of  them,  on  the  expiration  of 
their  leases,  removed  from  the  county, nothing  definite 
of  them  can  be  given.  In  some  cases  the  purchasers 
of  the  land  remained  in  the  East  or  in  other  States 
from  whence  they  emigrated  until  the  land  was  par- 
tially cleared  up.  These  leasers  were  to  make  speci- 
fied improvements  on  the  premises  and  live  thereon 
for  a  term  of  years  free  of  rent,  etc.,  etc.  Of  this 
class  we  would  gladly  write  could  the  data  be  obtained. 

SCHOOLS. 

The  fu-st  school  held  in  the  township  is  thought 
to  have  been  kept  in  a  cabin  just  north  of  the  village 
of  Fayetteville  in  1823,  taught  by  Eleanor  Blair. 
Two  or  three  years  later  Miss  Mitchell  taught  a  school 
in  a  cabin  house  that  stood  probably  one  and  a  half 
miles  east  of  north  of  Fayetteville,  on  what  is  now 
the  Joseph  Gamble  farm — then  the  Russell  land. 
The  cabin  had  been  occupied  as  a  dwelling  by  Mr. 
Russell,  and  abandoned  on  his  building  a  new  one. 

District  No.  1  was  organized  in  1824  under  the 
law.  The  tax  levied  was  nearly  all  paid  in  labor  or 
material.  The  ground  upon  which  it  stood,  situated 
on  the  hill  northwest  of  Gray's  saw-mill,  was  donated 
by  John  Coley.  The  building  was  in  keeping  with 
the  houses  of  that  period — of  hewed  logs,  the  floor 
of  walnut  puncheons,  clapboard  roof,  and  the  chim- 
ney of  stone.  It  is  thought  that  a  Mr.  Gunn  taught 
the  flrst  school  in  this  building.  In  1825  a  second 
school  district  was  organized  in  Danville  (now  Fay- 
etteville). Wiley  J.  Daniel  was  one  of  the  early 
teachers  in  the  Danville  building.  Subsequently  a 
frame  house  was  built  in  the  village,  in  which  J.  P. 
Daniel  taught  for  a  time.  James  Rhodes  is  also 
remembered  as  having  taught  in   the  village  school. 

The  first  schoolhouse  in  the  settlement  along 
Sain's  Creek  stood  in  the  northwest  quarter  of  Sec- 
tion 36,  on  what  is  now  the  land  of  A.  Winchell. 
Early  teachers  in  this  house  were  Alexander  Patton, 
John  Bell  and  Thomas  Points.  The  next  house  in 
this  section  of  the  country  was  built  some  400  yards 
south  of  the  other.  Alexander  Matney  taught  in  this 
building.  The  condition  of  the  schools  of  the  town- 
ship in  1879  is  shown  by  the  following  report  of  the 
County  Superintendent: 

"  The  Trustee,  Mr.  Anson  Moore,  is  earnest  in  the

oversight  of  his  schools,  and  his  management  seems 
to  give  very  general  satisfaction,  although  he  is  some- 
what cramped  in  special  finances  on  full  time.  Ap- 
jjliances  only  fair.  Has  time-pieces,  I  believe,  but 
needs,  for  the  comfort  of  his  scholars,  better  and 
more  commodious  rooms,  shade  trees,  etc.,  as  soon  as 
convenient.  Mr.  Moore  visits  his  schools  and  famil- 
iarizes himself  with  the  children  and  teachers. 
School  interests  are  safe  in  his  hands.  Number  of 
children — males,  151;  females,  124;  total,  275.  Num- 
ber of  schools,  live  (one  double  school).  Teachers 
are  doing  satisfactory  work,  so  far  as  we  have  known." 

MILLS,   DISTILLERIES,  ETC. 

The  first  mill  in  the  township  was  built  in  1822 
by  Elias  B.  Stone.  It  was  a  grist-mill.  S.  H.  Stone 
came  out  from  Kentucky  the  first  time  to  assist  his 
brother  in  erecting  the  mill.  The  mill  was  located 
on  the  south  branch  of  Garrison's  Creek,  and  not  far 
from  the  center  of  the  township.  Subsequently 
Silas  H.  Stone  added  a  saw-mill  and  also  built  a 
grist-mill,  and  operated  both  for  years.  The  mill 
property  passed  into  the  hands  of  Jack  Lindsey  and 
James  Tuttle,  who  built  and  carried  on  in  connection 
with  the  mills  a  distillery.  On  the  north  branch  of 
Garrison's  Creek  Hugh  Gray  built  a  saw-mill  very 
early — prior  to  1833.  On  this  stream  above  the  Gray 
Mill  later  was  built  a  saw-mill  by  William  Reed. 
Mr.  Starbuck  started  a  tan-yard  at  Fayetteville  quite 
early,  which  was  by  him  carried  on  some  time. 
His  successor  in  this  line  in  the  same  village  was 
Isham  Keith.  Some  years  subsequent  to  1833  there 
was  a  carding-machine  in  operation  in  Fayetteville 
by  Benjamin  F.  Morrow.  This,  however,  was  short- 
lived. 

CHURCHES  AND  BORYING-GROUNDS. 

Among  the  first  emigrants  settling  in  the  town- 
ship were  a  number  who  were  members  of  the  Re- 
formed Presbyterian  Church,  and  in  due  time  such 
an  organization  was  formed  and  a  church  buildincr 
erected  on  laud  deeded  by  Samuel  Hornady  (now  the 
Robert  Martin  place)  in  Section  3.  The  organiza- 
tion took  place  early,  yet  the  meeting-house  was  not 
built  for  a  number  of  years  thereafter,  and  then 
remained  in  an  unfinished  state  until  probably  1848 
or  1849.  Among  the  original  members  of  the  church 
here  were  the  Dills,  the  Russells,  the  Craigs,  and 
others. 

On  the  division  which  took  place  in  the  Presby- 
terian Church  in  1833,  the  church  under  considera- 
tion was  divided;  those  adhering  to  the  doctrines  of 
the  Old  School  withdrew,  and  erected,  in  about  1850, 
a  house  of  worship  a  half  mile  south  of  the  other 
building.  Among  the  early  members  of  this  congre- 
gation were  John  Alexander,  Mr.  Reed,  Mr,  Gowdy, 


Robert  and  Martin  Gamble,  the  Hustons  and  others. 

Both  churches  in  their  early  history  had  only  sup- 
plies. From  about  1848  until  some  time  before  the 
late  war,  Rev.  Josiah  Dodds  preached  for  the  Old 
School  congregation.  Since  that  time  Revs.  Robb, 
Johnson  and  McClerkin  have  served  that  people. 

Among  the  early  members  of  the  New  School 
Church  were  Thomas  Little  and  sons — Samuel  and 
John — William  Marks,  John  Gamble,  James  Landen, 
Thomas  Marks  and  John  G.  Gray.  From  about  1849 
until  1859,  Rev.  Andrew  Heron  served  the  congrega- 
tion, since  which  time  they  have  had  supplies  only. 
In  1881  the  house  of  worship  was  destroyed  by  fire, 
and  since  then,  and  for  a  time  prior  thereto,  the  con- 
gregation has  been  holding  services  in  the  church 
building  at  Glenwood. 

There  is  a  small  burying-ground  at  each  church. 
At  the  north  grave-yard  the  earliest  burial  marked  by 
a  tombstone  is  that  of  an  infant  daughter  of  E.  and 
J.  Cooper,  who  died  in  1837.  Among  the  aged  buried 
in  this  yard  are  Samuel  and  Jane  Hamilton,  Elizabeth 
Little,  William  Culbertson,  Martha  Gamble,  Jane 
Crawford,  Ann  Carter  and  Nancy  Luke. 

At  the  south  grave-yard,  among  the  aged  whose 
graves  are  marked  by  tombstones  are  Mary  McMillan, 
aged  seventy- two  years;  George  Creelman,  aged 
ninety-three  years;  Rosanna  Williamson,  aged 
seventy-six  years;  Robert  Gamble,  aged  seventy-three 
years;  Jane  Milligan,  aged  eighty-one  years;  and 
Robert  Craig,  aged  eighty- two  years. 

The  grave-yard  at  Fayetteville  dates  back  to  the 
first  settlement  of  that  vicinity.  As  earlj'  as  1833 
there  were  quite  a  number  of  graves  in  it.  Among 
the  aged  interred  here  are  W.  J.  Daniel,  aged  about 
eighty  years;  John  R.  Daniel,  aged  seventy-four 
years;  John  Wagoner,  aged  eighty  four  years ;  Elder 
John  Haslett,  aged  seventy-three  years;  Noah  Daw- 
son, aged  seventy- niney  oars;  Joshua  Crawford, aged 
seventy-five  years. 

The  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  at  Fayetteville 
had  its  origin  in  a  class  that  was  organized  in  1822 
by  Rev.  John  Havens,  a  local  preacher,  at  the  house 
of  Judge  Gregg,  one  mile  west  of  Fayetteville.  The 
class  consisted  of  the  following- named  eleven  mem- 
bers: Judge  Gregg  and  wife,  Samuel  Rounds  and 
wife,  Noah  Dawson  and  wife,  Mrs.  Sarah  George, 
Hugh  Wilson,  Thomas  Dawson,  John  Merrick,  Sr., 
and  John  Merrick,  Jr. 

The  quarterage  paid  by  the  circuit  the  first  year 
was  $36. 12i  of  which  Gregg's  class  paid  |2. 12i.  Of 
this  sum  the  Pastor  received  $31.87 J,  and  the  Presid- 
ing Elder  $4.25. 

This  class  constituted  an  appointment  on  the  Con- 
nersville  Circuit  until  Columbia  Circuit  was  formed 
in  1851.     The  first  house  of   worship  of   the  society 


HISTORY  OP  FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


221 


was  built  in  Fayetteville  in  1838,  for  some  time  prior 
to  which  date  meetings  were  conducted  in  the  wagon- 
shop  of  John  Merrick.  The  church  building,  a  frame, 
was  used  until  the  present  beautiful  and  commodious 
edifice  was  erected  in  1872,  at  a  cost  of  $3,000.  The 
charge  is  now  a  part  of  Glenwood  Circuit,  of  which 
Rev.  J.  W.  Dashiell  is  pastor.  Present  membership 
about  fifty.  At  the  dedication  of  the  new  church 
Rev.  Dr.  Andrus,  President  of  Asbury  University, 
ofBciated. 

The  Christian  Chui'ch  at  Fayetteville  was  organ- 
ized July  4,  1829,  by  Elder  John  P.  Thompson.  The 
frame  of  a  meeting-house  was  soon  put  up  by  Elias 
B.  Stone,  one  of  the  charter  members,  principally  at 
his  own  expense.  The  building  was  not  completed 
for  several  years.  In  1851  a  substantial  frame  house 
of  worship  was  erected,  principally  through  the  efforts 
of  E.  S.  Frazee,  who  has  preached  for  the  congrega- 
tion on  an  average  of  half  the  time  since  1851.  In 
1875  the  building  was  remodeled  and  rebuilt,  and 
is  now  substantial  and  commodious.  Elder  John  P. 
Thompson  continued  preaching  for  the  church  until 
his  death  in  1871.  Among  the  early  regular  pastors 
of  the  society  were  William  McPherson,  John  O'Kane, 
R.  T.  Brown,  George  Campbell  and  Henry  Pritchard. 
For  the  last  third  of  a  century  the  society  has  met 
regularly  on  the  first  day  of  the    week    for  worship. 

In  the  early  settling  of  this  township  another 
Methodist  society  was  organized,  and  held  services  at 
private  bouses  and  in  schoolhouses  until  in  about 
1837,  when  the  old  frame  building,  yet  standing  in 
the  southern  part  of  the  township  near  the  residence  of 
Alexander  Matney,  was  erected  for  a  house  of  worship. 
This  was  so  used'  until  probalily  ten  years  ago, 
when  the  society,  having  become  weak,  abandoned 
the  house,  which  was  sold  to  Mr.  Matney.  The  con- 
gregation then  went  to  other  churches  of  that  denom- 
ination in  the  vicinity. 

Just  a  short  distance  from  the  church  above 
described  stands  a  frame  house  of  worship,  built  on 
ground  deeded  by  Alexander  Matney.  The  building 
was  erected  by  general  subscription,  and  has  been 
used  as  a  union  church,  its  doors  being  open  for  all 
denominations.  This  was  built  some  fifty  or  sixty 
years  ago.  Since  1874  or  thereabouts  it  has  been 
principally  occupied  by  a  United  Brethren  congrega- 
tion, organized  by  Rev.  Alexander  Carroll.  This 
congregation  now  holds  services  there  once  every 
three  weeks,  with  Rev.  Mr.  Boland  in  charge. 

The  grave-yard  on  the  hill  not  far  distant  from 
either   church   had  its  origin  in  the  family   place  of 


burial  of  the  Rinearsons.  David  and  John  Rinear- 
soD  were  among  the  first  interments  in  it.  Subse- 
quently the  ground  fell  into  possession  of  Alexander 
Matney,  who  donated  one- half  acre  to  those  in  charge 
of  the  church  for  burial  purposes. 

FAYETTEVILLE. 

This  pretty  little  village,  situated  in  the  extreme 
western  part  of  the  township  on  the  road  forming 
the  boundary  line  between  the  two  counties,  was  laid 
out  by  the  surveyor,  Thomas  Hinkson,  for  Elias  B. 
Stone  and  Isaac  Thomas,  October  12,  1824.  It  was 
then  designated  as  Danville.  In  1841  an  addition 
to  the  village  (south)  was  made  by  Elias  B.  Stone, 
surveyed  by  William  Dickey.  Robert  Cox  kept  the 
first  store  in  the  village,  Robert  Wilson  was  the  first 
blacksmith,  and  Drs.  Mason,  Helm  and  Daniel  early 
physicians.  Mr.  Cox,  in  addition  to  blacksmithing, 
manufactured  bells. 

In  1833  Burgess  Q.  Wells  was  a  merchant,  and  in 
1837  the  Postmaster  of  the  village.  Later  of  the 
early  merchants  were  James  M.  Conner  and  Thomas 
Marks;  John  Latchem  was  another  of  the  early  "vil- 
lage smiths;"  John  B.  Williams  was  the  cabinet- 
maker in  1833,  and  one  Vantyne  the  wagon-maker. 
Joshua  Wolf  was  another  of  the  early  blacksmiths. 

The  first  frame  house  in  the  village  was  built  by 
Dr.  Jefferson  Helm  in  1830  or  1831.  It  is  still  stand- 
ing, and  is  now  occupied  by  Thomas  Boylan.  The 
first  and  only  brick  house  in  the  village  was  built  by 
Joshua  Wolf. 

The  village  at  present  has  a  population  of  prob-

THIS,  the  second  township  in  size  in  the  county, 
is  situated  in  the  northwestern  part  thereof, 
bounded  on  the  north  by  Henry  and  Wayne  Counties, 
on  the  east  by  Wayne  County,  on  the  south  by  Fair- 
view  and  Harrison  Townships,  and  on  the  west  by 
Rush  County.  Its  organization  dates  from  1823. 
The  Commissioners  of  the  county  at  their  February 
session  of  that  year  ordered  that  "henceforth  all 
that  district  of  country  and  part  of  Harrison  Town- 
ship which  is  inclosed  in  the  following  bounds,  shall 
form  and  constitute  a  new  township  to  be  known  and 
designated  by  the  name  of  Posey  Township,  to-wit: 
Beginning  at  the  southwest  corner  of  Wayne  County, 
at  the  southeast  corner  of  Section  28,  running  thence 
north  on  the  county  line  live  miles  to  the  extreme 
northeast  corner  of  Fayette  County;  thence  west  six 
miles  to  the  northwest  corner  of  said  county;  thence 
south  five  miles  to  the  southwest  corner  of  Section 
27;  thence  east  on  the  section  line  to  the  place  of 
beginning."  The  boundary  lines  are  the  same  to-day 
as  when  originally  formed.

PIONEERS  AND  PIONEER  NOTES. 

In  the  above  list  of  names  of  the  original  pur- 
chasers of  the  land  of  Posey  Township  are  many  who 
were  actual  settlers,  moved  upon  the  land,  cleared 
and  improved  farms,  took  part  in  the  building  of 
churches,  schoolhouses  and  roads,  figured  in  its  polit- 
ical and  civil  history,  and  were  identified  with  the 
various  movements  made  in  the  direction  of  progress 
and  high  state  of  civilization. 

The  earliest  settler  of  whom  we  have  been  able 
to  get  any  definite  information  is  George  Manlove,  a 
native  of  North  Carolina,  who  attempted  a  settle- 
ment on  the  head- waters  of  Lick  Creek  in  the  south- 
eastern part  of  the  township  in  1811,  entering  the 
northeast  quarter  of  Section  28,  October  31,  1811, 
the  first  purchase  made  in  what  is  now  Posey 
Township.  Mr.  Manlove  was  related  to  the  Cald- 
well's who  settled  at  the  same  time  just  east  in  what 
is'now  Harrison  Township.  They  had  all  settled  for 
a  time  at  Fairhaven,  Preble  Co.,  Ohio,  from  whence 
they  came  to  what  became  Fayette  County.  It  is 
said  that  Mr.  Manlove,  with  the  Caldwells,  being 
somewhat  afraid  of  trouble  with  the  Indians,  returned 


to  Preble  County  and  remained  until  in  1814,  when 
all  returned  to  their  settlements  here  already  com- 
menced. 

Mr.  Kolb,  who  made  the  entry  in  1812,  was  from 
the  State  of  South  Carolina. 

John  Loder  emigrated  from  the  State  of  New  Jer- 
sey and  settled  on  the  land  entered  in  1814,  in  1816 
or  1817.  He  was  the  father  of  Mrs.  Linville  Fergu- 
son, now  of  Milton,  this  State. 

Manlove  Caldwell  was  of  the  same  family  just 
referred  to. 

The  Mungers,  among  the  first  to  enter  and  settle 
upon  land  in  the  "  New  Purchase, "  were  from  Rut- 
land County,  Vt.  Edmund  K. ,  with  family,  settled 
about  one  and  a  half  miles  southeast  of  the  present 
site  of  Bentonville  in  the  fall  of  1821.  He  was  the 
son  of  Brig.-Gen.  Edward  Munger,  of  Vermont,  who 
in  the  early  history  of  Ohio  went  to  Belpre,  and  there 
raised  and  disciplined  an  army,  with  headquarters 
near  Dayton.  The  Mungers  settled  for  a  time  in  that 
locality,  where  now,  in  Montgomery  and  Greene  Coun- 
ties (Ohio),  a  number  of  their  descendants  reside. 
Edward  and  Lazarus,  now  residents  of  this  township' 
are  sons  of  Edmund  K. 

Andrew  M.  B.  Cole,  still  a  resident  of  the  town- 
ship, a  brother-in-law  of  the  Edmund  K.  Munger  just 
spoken  of,  came  to  this  locality  with  him,  but  soon 
returned  to  his  native  State,  Virginia,  and  in  1826, 
with  his  parents,  Samuel  and  Catharine,  made  a  per- 
manent settlement. 

John  and  Rachel  (Beard)  Fraizer,  natives  of 
North  Carolina,  settled  in  the  township  in  1821,  upon 
land  where  a  son,  Thomas  E.,  now  resides. 

George  Van  Buskirk,  Sr.,  and  family,  from  Ken- 
tucky, settled  in  the  vicinity  of  Cambridge  City  in 
1815,  and  in  1831  a  son,  George,  Jr.,  settled  in  the 
vicinity  of  where  he  now  resides  just  west  of  Ben- 
tonville, where  he  has  played  well  his  part  in  con- 
verting the  wilderness  of  that  day  into  the  beautiful 
farms  of  the  present. 

Among  other  pioneers  of  that  part  of  the  town- 
ship lying  in  the  "  New  Purchase"  were  the  Gal- 
breaths,  Isaac  and  David,  who  emigrated  from  Ken- 
tucky in  1820,  and  in  that  year  settled  Jehu  Vickroy, 
from  North  Carolina. 

In  1821  came  John  Chapel,  Micajah  Jackson, 
Henry  Thornburg,  Reason  Reagan  and  Bennett  B. 
Cook,  from  North  Carolina;  John  G.  and  William 
Eaton,  from  Ohio;  John  Middleton  and  Thomas  B. 
Stiles,  from  New  Jersey;  Amos  Goflf,  from  Kentucky; 
Peter  Marts,  from  Pennsylvania. 

In  1822  came  John  Hallis,  William  Beard,  Rob- 
ert Mitchell,  James  McConkey,  Daniel  New,  Will- 
iam Patterson,  Godfrey  Peck,  John  and  Peter  Kem- 
mer and  Lawrence  _Quinn,  from  Kentucky;    William

The  candidates  at  this  election  were  Thomas  Kirk- 
wood,  Jacob  Shinkle,  and  John  Treadway,  and  the 
number  of  votes  cast  for  each  was  17,  21  and  16  re- 
spectively. 

William  Manlove,  a  son  of  George  Manlove,  was 
born  January  19,  1815,  and  is  believed  to  have  been 
the  tirst  white  child  born  in  the  township. 

The  first  school  taught  in  the  township  was  by 
George  Manlove,  in  1818. 

The  tirst  wedding  is  believed  to  have  been  that  of 
Mr.  John  Case  to  Miss  Mary  Caldwell,  which  occurred 
at  the  dwelling  of  the  bride's  father,  not  far  from  the 
Bchoolhouse. 


The  first  death  that  occurred  is  thought  to  have 
been  that  of  William  Manlove,  Sr. 

The  first  house  having  a  shingle  roof  was  the 
dwelling  of  George  Manlove. 

The  first  and  only  grist-mill  in  the  township  was 
built  not  far  from  1830,  in  Section  5,  on  Simons 
Creek.  It  did  service  for  probably  twenty  years.  On 
the  same  creek,  in  Section  4,  and  not  far  from  the 
same  time,  a  saw-mill  was  operated  by  the  father  of 
J.  A.  Baldwin. 

SCHOOLS,    CHURCHES    AND    GKAVE-YAEDS. 

The  first  schoolhouse  built  in  the  township  stood 
in  the  southeast  corner  thereof,  and  in  the  portion  of 
the  Territoiy  lying  in  the  "Twelve  Mile  Purchase" 
(Section  28),  and  the  first  teacher  was  the  pioneer, 
George  Manlove,  above  referred  to  as  settling  in  that 
locality  in  1811.  This  school  was  conducted  as  early 
as  1818  by  Mr.  Manlove. 

Just  over  the  line  in  Wayne  County,  from  the 
Loder  settlement,  stood  an  early  built  schoolhouse,  in 
which,  not  far  from  1826,  was  teaching  Joseph  Will- 
iams. Mrs.  Linville  Ferguson  (then  Miss  Loder), 
attended  this  school. 

During  the  decade  between  1820  and  1830  some 
five  Bchoolhouses  were  built  in  various  parts  of  the 
township. 

The  first  erected  in  the  Van  Buskirk  neighborhood, 
probably  one  mile  and  a  half  west  of  the  village  of 
Bentonville,  stood  on  the  land  of  Mr.  Van  Buskirk, 
and  was  built  about  the  year  1831.  It  was  of  the 
first  type — round  logs, greased  paper  for  windows,  etc. 
Early  teachers  here  were  John  Treadway,  John  Legg 
and  Miss  Lavinia  Church,  the  latter  being  the  first 
lady  teacher  in  that  vicinity.  Among  the  children 
attending  school  in  this  building  were  those  of  George 
Van  Buskirk,  of  Samuel  Kemmer,  of  John  Norcross, 
of  Micajah  Jackson,  and  others.  This  house  was  not 
in  use  many  years  when  the  neighborhood  built 
another  log-house,  probably  a  quarter  of  a  mile  fur- 
ther west.  These  schools  were  all  supported  by  sub- 
scription, but  not  long  after  this  schoolhouses  were 
built  and  kept  up  by  public  money.  Merchant  Kelly 
is  remembered  as  having  taught  in  the  settlement 
west  of  Bentonville  for  many  years. 

The  condition  of  the  schools  of  the  township  in 
1879  is  shown  in  the  following  published  report  of 
the  County  Superintendent: 

"  The  Trustee  of  the  township  is  Mr.  Hathaway, 
who  is  cautious  and  economical.  He  is  serving  a  sec- 
ond term,  and  has  the  approval  of  the  school  men  of 
the  township.  His  teachers  are  a  fair  average  of  the 
county,  with  one  or  two  exceptions.  The  number  of 
schools  in  the  township  is  six.  Mr.  Hathaway  visits 
bis  schools,  is  present  at  township  institutes,  and  con-

ducts  the  same,  and  is  favorable  to  the  interests  of 
education  in  every  way.  He  maintained  a  high  school 
last  fall  at  Bentonville.  Number  of  scholars:  Male, 
127;  female,  128.  Total,  225.  This  township  has  a 
time-piece  in  every  school,  but  needs  more  blackboards, 
etc." 

Among  the  earliest  settlers  of  the  township  were  a 
number  of  Methodists  who  at  once  formed  a  class  or 
society  and  met  at  private  dwellings,  and  in  the  sum- 
mer season  in  the  groves,  which  wei'e  "God's  first 
temples,"  and  there  held  communion  with  the 
Almighty.  In  1823  the  class  met  at  Lowers,  and 
among  the  members  at  that  time  were  Jacob  and  Joe 
Lower,  the  Hardins,  Millers,  Wilsons  and  others. 
The  appointment  was  on  the  Connersville  Circuit, 
which  had  only  recently  been  formed.  The  circuit 
was  a  large  one,  and  preaching  was  held  at  many  of 
the  appointments  through  the  week,  the  Sabbath 
preaching  generally  being  conducted  by  the  local 
preachers.  Among  the  later  Methodists  were  Thomas 
Stiles  and  wife,  George  Patterson  and  wife,  and  John 
Eyestone  and  wife.  Their  first  meeting-house  was  a  log 
one,  and  was  built  about  one  and  a  half  miles  southwest 
of  Bentonville.  Later  they  built  a  frame  house  at 
Bentonville,  where  services  are  still  occasionally  held, 
though  the  society  is  weak,  and  some  four  or  five  or 
more  years  ago  they  disposed  of  the  building,  which 
was  converted  into  a  public  hall  by  the  township. 
The  appointment  was  long  on  the  Connersville  Cir- 
cuit, and  later  became  a  part  of  the  charges  along  the 
western  part  of  the  county. 

The  Christian  Church  at  Bentonville  was  organ- 
ized not  far  from  1836  by  Rev.  John  O'Kane.  Among 
the  first  members  were  George  Van  Buskirk  and  wife, 
Philip  Shrader  and  wife,  Trueman  Munger  and  wife, 
Moses  Ellis  and  wife,  and  Richard  Kolb  and  wife. 
Services  were  held  in  private  dwellings  and  in  school- 
houses  until  in  1840,  when  a  frame  church  building 
was  erected  just  south  of  Bentonville,  which  the  soci- 
ety occupied  until  they  became  too  large  to  be 
comfortably  seated,  when  it  gave  way  to  the  present 
neat  and  substantial  frame  edifice  built  a  year  ago  at 
a  cost  of  about  $2,500.  The  ground,  one  and  a  half 
acres,  was  deeded  for  church  and  burial  purposes  to 
the  Trustees  of  the  society  by  John  Gilleland.  Among 
the  early  ministers  of  the  church  were  Revs.  John 
O'Kane,  Elijah  Martindale,  John  Longley,  John 
Brown,  Jacob  Daubenspeck,  R.  T.  Brown,  Thomas 
Conly  and  Elijah  Goodwin.  The  present  member- 
ship is  about  seventy-five,  which  is  in  charge  of  Rev. 
Lewis  Wilson. 

The  grave-yard  at  the  church  is  about  the  age  of 
the  society.  Among  the  first  interments  made  in  it 
were  the  bodies  of  Sutherland  Gard,  Richard  Kolb 
and  Price  Shortridge.  The  latter,  according  to  the  in- 


scription on  the  tombstone,  died  August  30,  1834. 
From  the  inscriptions  on  the  tombstones  and  more 
pretentious  monuments  it  is  evident  that  many  of  the 
pioneers  were  here  interred.  Some  of  the  aged  are 
as  follows: 

John  Engels,  died  in  1859,  aged  sixty-five  years; 
Rosey  Engels,  died  in  1877,  aged  seventy- four  years; 
Hester  Loder,  born  in  1790,  died  in  1874;  Mahala 
Cole,  died  in  1882,  aged  seventy-one  years;  William 
Van  Dyke,  died  in  1875,  aged  eighty  years;  Samuel 
Pierson,  died  in  1883,  aged  seventy-seven  years; 
James  Gilleland,  died  in  1854,  aged  seventy-three 
years;  Amos  Gilleland,  died  in  1876,  aged  eighty-six 
years;  Mary  WesterBeld,  died  in  1856,  aged  seventy- 
two  years;  John  Gilleland, died  in  1876,  aged  eighty- 
seven  years;  Mary  Gilleland,  died  in  1865,  aged  sev- 
enty-seven years;  John  Treadway,  died  in  1838,  aged 
forty-three,  years;  Phoebe  Brown,  died  in  1852,  aged 
eighty-three  years;  Thomas  Shipley,  died  in  1846, 
aged  seventy-three  years;  Eleanor  Shipley,  died  in 
1857,  aged  seventy-four  years;  Philip  Shrader,  died 
in  1870,  aged  seventy-eight  years;  Isabella  Loder, 
died  in  1863,  aged  seventy-eight  years;  Thomas 
Stiles,  died  in  1864,  aged  eighty  years;  Rebecca 
Stiles,  died  in  1867,  aged  eighty-one  years  ; 
Ruth  Middleton,  died  in  1861,  aged  seventy-two 
years. 

Just  north  of  the  old  part  of  the  church-yard  and 
adjoining  it— all  within  the  same  enclosure — some 
years  ago  another  tract  of  an  acre  and  a  half  of  land 
was  purchased  of  James  Huston,  which  was  planted  in 
evergreens  and  regularly  laid  out  into  lots,  and  a 
beautiful  cemetery  established  which  is  now  thickly 
dotted  over  by  marble  columns  and  granite  monu- 
ments of  elegant  and  costly  design. 

Until  recent  years  a  congregation  of  Missionary 
Baptists  worshiped  about  a  mile  west  of  Benton- 
ville. The  society  was  organized  in  that  vicinity 
many  years  ago,  and  among  the  early  members  were 
the  Longwells,  Carvers,  Thomases,  and  Knopps. 
Services  were  held  in  the  neighborhood  schoolhouse, 
which  was  finally  purchased  by  the  society,  who  built 
an  addition  to  it,  and  until  the  society  disbanded 
used  it  as  a  house  of  worship. 

On  the  land  now  owned  by  Andrew  Cole,  about 
three  miles  northwest  of  Bentonville,  is  the  oldest 
public  burying-ground  in  the  township.  In  the  early 
history  of  this  section  the  land  was  owned  by  Isaac 
Metcalf ;  the  spot  comprising  the  place  of  burial  was 
suitable  for  such,  and  a  public  grave-yard  was  soon 
made  of  it.  A  Mrs.  Spencer  was  among  the  first  buried 
in  this  yard.  After  the  establishment  of  the  grave- 
yard at  the  Christian  Church,  not  many  interments 
were  made  in  the  Cole  burying-ground,  although  it 
is  still  used  to  some  extent.

HISTORY   OF   FAYETTE   COUNTY. 


BENTONVILLE. 

Benton vi  lie,  so  named  in  honor  of  the  late  states- 
man, Thomas  Benton,  of  Missouri,  is  a  little  hamlet 
situated  south  of  the  center  of  the  township  and  is  a 
station  on  the  J.  M.  &amp;  I.  R.  R.  Thirteen  lots  were 
platted  by  Joseph  Dale,  the  proprietor  thereof,  on  the 
7th  of  August,  1838.  The  surveying  was  done  by 
William  Dickey  on  the  same  day. 

An  addition  was  made  to  the  place  in  1S44  by 
Thomas  K.  Stiles. 

Before  the  hamlet  was  laid  out  William  Young 
had  built  a  house  there  and  was  employed  as  a  tailor. 
Among  the  early  business  men  of  the  place  was  Brad- 
ley Perry,  who  was  the  neighborhood  blacksmith; 
a  Mr.  Woodson,  Samuel  Dickey  and  Joseph  Mc- 
Cauley,  Woodford  Dale  and  Alfred  Loder,  merchants; 
William  Stockdale,  tanner. 

The  hamlet  today,  in  a  business  sense,  consists  of 
one  blacksmith  shop,  three  groceries,  one  shoe  shop, 
one  wagon  shop  and  a  steam  saw-mill. 


HALF-CENTURY    CITIZENS.

CHAPTER  XXYI. 


FAIRVIEW  TOWNSHIP. 

ORGANIZATION     AND    BOUNDARIES— LAND    ENTRIES— EARLY    SETTLEMENT— SCHOOLS— CHURCHES     AND    GRAVE- 
YARDS—VILLAGES—HALF-CENTURY CITIZENS. 


FAIRVIEW,  the  last  township  formed  in  the 
county,  was  not  organized  until  in  December, 
1851.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Posey  Town- 
ship, on  the  east  by  Harrison  and  Connersville  Town- 
ships, on  the  south  by  Orange  Township,  and  on  the 
west  by  Rush  County.  Its  territory  was  taken  from 
Orange  and  Harrison  Townships,  and  included  the 
land  lying  within  the  following  described  boundaries: 
"Beginning  at  the  southeast  corner  of  Section  25, 
Townshif)  1-1,  Range  11,  running  thence  west  three 
miles  to  the  Fayette  and  Rush  County  lines;  thence 
north  six  miles  on  said  line,  to  the  southwest  corner 
of  Posey  Township;  thence  east  three  miles  to  the 
range  line;  thence  south  six  miles  to  the  place  of 
beginning."  The  boundary  lines  have  not  since 
been  altered. 

The  sui'face  of  the  country  is  with  very  little 
exception  level,  and  the  lands  are  of  most  excellent 
farming  quality,  not  surpassed  if  equaled  by  any  in 
the  county.  Originally  the  land  was  covered  with  a 
dense  forest  of  a  variety  of  trees  indicative  of  a  good 
soil,  with  heavy  undergrowth  of  spice  of  considerable 


size,  as  some  few  who  are  still  with  us  can  testify, 
not  forgetting  the  labor  required  to  clear  it.  The 
township  is  under  a  thorough  system  of  drainage  and 
the  result  is  the  producing  of  large  crops.  The 
farms  are  well  improved  and  the  people  are  moral, 
law-abiding  and  enterprising  citizens. 

LAND    ENTRIES. 

The  lands  of  the  township  were  disposed  of  by 
the  Government  in  the  years  set  forth  below,  and  to

EARLY    SETTLEMENT. 

The  lands  of  Fairview,  lying  entirely  within  the 
"New  Pui-chase,"  were  not  settled  until,  comparative- 
ly speaking,  a  late  date.  However,  some  few  ventured 
within  its  borders  quite  early.  The  decade  between 
1820  and  1830  will  cover  the  period  of  its  early  settle 
ment,  the  tide  of  immigration  setting  in  in  about 
1820. 

It  is  very  probable  that  the  first  settlement  was 
effected  in  Section   12,    and  in  that  portion  of  the 


northeast  quarter  lying  adjacent  to  Connersville 
Township.  Charles  Williams,  a  young  man  and  a 
native  of  the  State  of  New  York,  settled  on  this  land 
in  1814.  He  was  a  carpenter  by  trade,  which  occu- 
pation he  followed  many  years,  during  which  time  he 
was  identified  with  the  erection  of  many  of  the  early 
and  more  recently  built  houses  and  barns  of  that  sec- 
tion of  the  country.  Mr.  Williams  came  from  Pitts- 
burgh, Penn. ,  by  flat-boat  to  Cincinnati;  thence  by 
wagon  to  the  county,  where  he  passed  the  remainder 
of  his  life.  He  also  followed  farming.  He  was  the 
father  of  Charles  M.  Williams,  ex-County  Auditor  and 
Surveyor. 

About  the  year  1819  William  Nelson  from  Ver- 
mont settled  on  what  is  now  the  G.  S.  Dunn  farm,  on 
a  branch  of  Williams  Creek. 

In  the  same  year,  emigrating  from  Ohio,  settled 
William  and  Alexander  Russell,  brothers,  locating  in 
the  northern  part  of  the  township. 

John  Ryburn  is  thought  to  have  settled  in  the 
township  in  1819. 

Ananias  Gifford,  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  removed 
to  Ohio  in  1815,  stopping  at  Newtown  on  the  Little 
Miami  River,  and  two  years  later  removed  to  Harris - 
burg,  where  he  remained  until  in  1821,  then  settled 
near  the  present  village  of  Fairview. 

About  the  same  year  (1821)  Robert  and  Matthew 
Hastings  and  Richard  Nash  settled  in  the  northern 
part  of  the  township.  Matthew  died  in  1881,  aged 
seventy-six  years.  It  is  said  that  he  and  Mr.  Nash 
when  young  were  engaged  in  boating  on  the  Ohio 
River. 

Andrew  Nelson,  a  native  of  Maine,  located  here 
in  1821. 

John  Rees,  Sr.,  grandfather  of  Justice  and  H.  C, 
now  residents  of  the  county,  from  Greene  County, 
Penn.,  settled  here  in  1821;  also  a  married  son,  John, 
located  here. 

About  the  same  year  came  Robert  McCrory,  Sr., 
a  native  of  County  Antrim,  Ireland,  from  whence 
he  emigrated  to  America,  landing  at  Baltimore  in 
1812.  Several  of  this  name  and  family  came  at  or 
about  the  same  period. 

Not  far  from  this  date  also  came  Samuel  Knot, 
Abraham  Kinder,  from  Virginia,  and  Samuel  and 
George  Heizer  from  New  Jersey.  All  located  south- 
east of  Fairview  village. 

In  1825  Ellis  D.  McConnell  settled  in  the  north 
part  of  the  township. 

In  1828  James,  a  brother  of  E.  D.  McConnell, 
located  here,  coming  here  from  Brown  County,  Ohio. 
In  1824  John  Thrasher  and  family  emigrated 
from  Pendleton  County,  K^.,  and  settled  just  across 
the  line  in  Rush  County,  yet  was  closely  identified 
with  the  history  of  Fairview  Township.     A  son,  Hon.

HISTORY  OF  PAYETTE   COUNTY. 


W.  W.  Thrasher,  now  a  resident  of  the  village  of  Fair- 
view,  in  1831  and  1832  purchased  land  where  he  now 
resides  of  John  Wallace,  who  had  located  there,  hav- 
ing come  from  Delaware.  Mr.  Thrasher  has  cleared 
some  300  acres  of  land. 

In  1820  Thomas  Keaten,  a  native  of  Maryland, 
located  in  the  township. 

Another  of  the  early  settlers  who  resided  just 
over  the  Rush  County  line,  though  closely  identified 
with  the  early  history  of  the  western  part  of  this 
county,  was  Robert  Grove,  a  Kentuckian. 

Another  was  Garrett  Wykoff,  who  came  from  New 
Jersey  in  1822.  He  owned  land  on  both  sides  of  the 
dividing  line  between  the  two  counties,  yet  his  house 
was  located  in  Rush  County. 

About  this  time,  or  perhaps  a  little  later,  the  Jeff- 
reys, Jeremiah  and  William,  from  the  State  of  New 
York,  located  east  of  Fairview  Village. 

A  number  of  the  Moffitts  in  1822  located  in  the 
township.  The  Moffitts  were  natives  of  Ireland,  and 
had  early  settled  in  Pennsylvania,  thence  in  Ohio, 
thence  to  this    locality. 

In  1825  Josiah  Piper  and  family  located  in  the 
vicinity  of  where  Falmouth  now  stands.  Mr.  Piper 
still  resides  on  the  land. 

The  Dickeys,  Hugh  and  William,  emigrating  from 
Kentucky,  located  in  about  1825  in  the  northern  tier 
of  sections. 

East  of  the  Dickeys  settled  the  Baker  brothers, 
John  and  David,  who  were  also  Kentuckians,  and  in 
that  vicinity  Drury  Tyner  was  another  of  the  pio- 
neers of  Fairview. 

Ross  Smily  was  another  of  the  pioneer  settlers. 
He  had  located  quite  early  further  east  in  what  is 
now  Union  County,  where  he  figured  conspicuously 
before  locating  in  this  township. 

William  Lear,  Collin  Banister,  Jacob  Ashpaw, 
John  Hawkins,  Samuel  Shortridge,  James  Runnells, 
John  Rees,  G.  Saxon,  Zachariah  Parish  and  the  Jacks 
were  pioneers  of  this  locality. 

There  being  no  roads,  these  early  settlers  were 
obliged  to  cut  out  the  undergrowth  to  reach  their 
prospective  homes.  The.  Pipers  resided  by  the  side 
of  a  large  poplar  tree  that  had  fallen,  for  some  time, 
until  their  cabin  was  built  and  ready  for  occu- 
pancy. They  were  compelled  to  carry  water  for  fam- 
ily use  about  three-quarters  of  a  mile,  and  the  only 
vessel  they  had  for  the  purpose  was  a  five-  gallon  keg. 
They  were  so  distant  from  neighbors  as  to  be  barely 
able  to  hear  the  bark  of  their  dogs.  Frequently 
weeks  passed  without  the  wife  of  this  pioneer  seeing 
a  woman. 

One  of  the  early  tan-yards  of  the  township  was 
operated  on  the  Jeffrey  land  by  Frank  Jeffrey. 

There  have  been  very  few  mills  and  distilleries  in 


this  section.  The  pioneers  and  subsequent  residents  of 
the  township  have  depended  upon  the  mills  of  neigh- 
boring subdivisions  for  such  conveniences.  In  about 
1838  or  1840  John  Moffitt  had  in  operation  a  saw- 
mill on  Williams  Creek  and  on  the  Nelson  land.  At 
the  same  time  just  below  this  mill  and  on  the  Wal- 
lace land  was  a  saw-mill  which  had  been  built  by 
Joshua  Wallace.  There  has  been  no  grist-mill,  we 
believe,  in  the  township. 

SCHOOLS. 

The  first  schoolhouse  erected  in  the  township,  we 
are  informed  by  Uncle  Samuel  Little,  stood  a  half 
mile  east  of  Moffitt's  Crossing,  built  in  1825,  and  was 
then  in  the  third  district  of  Orange  Township.  Mr. 
Little  says  "it  was  built  of  round  logs,  afterward 
hewed  down;  clap-board  roof;  no  chimney,  but  a 
stone  tire-place  in  the  center  of  the  puncheon  floor;  a 
flue  built  of  sticks  and  mortar,  rested  on  six-foot  posts; 
the  tire  being  in  the  center  of  the  house  all  parts  of 
the  room  were  heated  equally.  The  crevices  of  the 
house  were  closed  with  mortar  except  those  fronting 
the  writing-desks,  where  they  were  enlarged  to  fur- 
nish light,  which  was  admitted  through  greased  paper 
which  was  pasted  to  frames  fitted  to  those  apertures." 
The  first  school  in  this  house  was  taught  in  the  fall 
of  1826  by  Jonas  Price. 

The  first  schoolhouse  for  the  settlement  in  the 
neighborhood  of  where  Fairview  Village  now  is  stood 
over  the  Rush  County  line  at  the  grave-yard.  Mr. 
Piper  informs  us  that  this  house  was  built  about  1824 
for  a  meeting-house  on  ground  given  for  the  purpose 
by  Robert  Groves.  The  building  was  used  for  both 
church  and  school  purposes.  About  the  year  1825  a 
Mr.  Noble  was  teaching  here. 

Probably  two  years  later  (1827)  a  schoolhouse  was 
built  on  the  Jeffrey  land  in  which  school  was  first 
taught  by  Thomas  Dawson. 

About  the  year  1829  a  schoolhouse  stood  in  the 
northern  part  of  the  township  in  which,  at  that  time, 
John  Legg  was  keeping  school.  Later  in  the  same 
building  a  Mr.  McClure  taught  a  school. 

At  Fairview,  but  just  over  the  line  in  Rush 
County,  is  located  an  academy  building,  which  was 
erected  in  1848  by  general  subscription  of  that  sec- 
tion of  the  county  for  miles  around.  The  object  was 
to  establish  a  school  in  which  would  be  taught  the 
higher  branches,  then  not  taught  in  the  common  dis- 
trict schools.  Among  those  most  instrumental  in 
establishing  the  school  were  Dr.  Ephraim  Clifford, 
W.  W.  Thrasher,  William  Shawhan,  Rev.  H.  R. 
Pritchard,  Rev.  George  Campbell,  John  Campbell, 
John  Thrasher,  Donovan  Groves  and  G.  B.  Rush. 
The  first  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  institution  was  G. 
B.  Rush,  John  M.  Shawhan,  G.  Wykoff,  James  Han-

nah  and  Ephraim  Jeffrey.  The  building,  which  is  of 
brick,  was  erected  by  Josiah  Smith  at  a  cost  of 
13,500. 

Prof.  A.  K.  Benton,  a  graduate  of  Bethany  College, 
West  Virginia,  opened  the  first  school  in  the  building, 
and  taught  for  a  period  of  probably  ten  years,  during 
which  time  he  conducted  a  first-class  school.  He 
resigned  to  accept  a  Greek  professorship  in  the 
Northwestern  University  at  Indianapolis,  which  chair 
he  still  occupies.  Other  instructors  have  been  Profs. 
Hull,  of  Hiram,  Ohio;  Rev.  Daniel  Van  Bus- 
kirk,  William  Thrasher,  Walter  Campbell,  Bowen, 
Piercy  and  others.  The  institution  has  been  under 
the  control  of  the  Christian  Church.  Scholars  have 
been  in  attendance  at  this  school  from  the  States  of 
Illinois,  Louisiana,  Kentucky,  Ohio  and   New  York. 

CHURCHES    AND    GRAVE-YARDS. 

On  the  Rush  Couutyside  of  the  line,  nearly  oppo- 
site Fairview  Village,  is  located  a  frame  building 
which  has  for  many  years  been  the  house  of  worship 
of  the  Methodist  families  of  that  vicinity.  On  the 
the  same  site,  as  early  as  1824,  a  log  meeting-house 
was  erected  by  this  denomination  which  was  used  for 
both  church  and  school  purposes.  The  ground  upon 
which  it  stood  was  deeded  to  the  Trustees  of  the 
society,  probablyas  early  as  1822,  in  addition  to  some 
surrounding  it,  for  religious  and  burial  purposes,  by 
Robert  Grroves.  The  ground  then  deeded  was  one  acre, 
to  which  have  since  been  added,  deeded  by  W.  W. 
Thrasher,  at  different  times,  several  acres,  until  now 
there  are  included  at  the  cemetery  and  church-yard  some 
four  or  five  acres.  This,  in  recent  years,  has  been 
laid  out  into  lots  and  made  a  most  beautiful  place  of 
burial,  which  is  dotted  over  with  evergreens  and 
many  elegant  and  costly  monuments,  that  would  be  a 
credit  to  more  pretentious  cemeteries.  Here  lie  sleep- 
ing the  remains  of  many  of  the  pioneers  of  the 
region  of  the  country  for  many  miles  around,  among 
them  a  number  of  the  early  settlers  of  the  western 
part  of  Fayette  County.  Among  those  who  lived  to 
a  ripe  old  age  in  the  vicinity  interred  here  are: 

William  McCarty,  died  in  1874,  aged  eighty-six 
years;  Theresa  McCarty,  died  in  1877,  aged  eighty- 
three  years;  Ephraim  Jeffrey,  born  in  1817,  died  in 
1883;  William  Jeffrey,  died  in  1862,  aged  eighty- 
four  years;  Abraham  Baker,  died  in  1842,  aged 
seventy-eight  years;  Robert  Groves,  died  in  1855, 
aged  ninety-one  years  (a  Revolutionary  soldier); 
Martha,  his  wife,  died  in  1855,  aged  eighty-nine 
years  (from  the  tombstone  it  appears  that  this  couple 
lived  together  sixty-seven  years);  Ross  Smiley,  died 
in  1878,  aged  ninety  years;  Josiah  Thrasher,  died  in 
1849,  aged  eighty-six  years;  Robert  Hastings,  died 
in  1859,  aged  ninety-four  years;  Isabella  Hastings, 


died  in  1847,  aged  eighty-three  years;  Samuel  Isles, 
a  Revolutionary  soldier,  died  in  1842,  aged  one  hun- 
dred and  two  years. 

This  place  of  burial  has  been  extensively  used  for 
upward  of  sixty  years,  and  is  the  only  grave-yard  of 
any  size  in  that  section  of  the  county.  The  oldest 
grave  marked  by  a  tombstone  is  that  of  Petro  Rush, 
who  died  October  24,  1824  (born  in  1776).  The  first 
burial  here  is  thought  to  have  been  made  in  the  spring 
of  1824,  a  child  of  John  Smith,  in  March  of  that 
year. 

The  Fairview  Christian  Church,  which  too  stands 
just  over  the  line  (west)  dividing  the  counties  of  Rush 
and  Fayette,  was  organized  in  1843  with  a  member- 
ship of  forty,  prominent  among  whom  were  William 
Shawhan  and  family,  John  Thrasher  and  family, 
W.  W.  Thrasher  and  family,  Josiah  Piper  and  fam- 
ily, Jacob  Parish  and  family,  John  Bates  and  fam- 
ily, and  Samuel  Shortridge  and  family.  The  first 
house  of  worship  was  a  frame,  and  was  erected  in 
1844,  which  was  replaced  in  1872  by  the  present  neat 
and  substantial  brick  edifice,  which  has  a  cupola  and 
bell.  Among  the  pioneer  pastors  of  the  church  were 
Revs.  Arthur  Miller,  Bird  Byfield,  John  O'Kane,  John 
Longley,  Houshour,  John  P.  Thompson,  Benjamin 
Reeves,  Peter  Wiles  and  Jacob  Daubenspeck. 

VILLAGES. 

The  little  hamlet  or  village  of  Fairview  is  situated 
in  the  western  part  of  the  township  and  is  comprised 
of  a  little  cluster  of  neat  dwellings  just  east  of  the 
highway  forming  the  division  line  between  Rush  and 
Fayette  Counties.  The  inhabitants  now  number 
probably  100,  who  are  a  moral  and  religious  people, 
never  having  permitted  liquor  sold  in  the  village  and 
have  for  years  had  two  churches  nearly  within  a 
"  stone's  throw."  The  people  are  supplied  with  one 
grocery  and  the  "  village  smith"  is  there. 

Fairview  was  laid  out  on  the  land  of  W.  W. 
Thrasher,  and  the  first  house  of  the  village  was  a 
hewed  log  one  built  not  far  from  1828  by  William 
Powers.  The  first  merchant  of  the  place  was  John 
McClure.  He  was  followed  by  Birdsall  &amp;  Co.,  in 
about  1835.  The  successor  to  this  firm  was  William 
Moffitt.  Of  the  early  blacksmiths  were  a  Mr.  Van 
valkenburg,  followed  by  Brown  &amp;  Bros,  and  this  firm 
by  William  Irvin. 

Falmouth  is  a  village  of  two  counties  located  in 
the  northwestern  part  of  the  township  on  either 
side  of  the  road  dividing  Rush  and  Fayette  Counties. 
It  was  surveyed  July  24,  1832,  by  Thomas  Hinkson 
— laid  off  on  land  belonging  to  James  and  Elijah 
Patterson  and  Patrick  McCann.  That  portion  lying 
east  of  Madison  Street  is  in  Fayette  County  and  that 
west  of  the  same  street  is  in  Rush  County.     Additions

were  made  to  the  place  in  1838  by  Ed  L.  McGee, 
Stephen  Isles  and  Jeremiah  Jeffrey.  The  greater  por- 
tion of  the  village  is  in  Rush  County. 

The  first  house  on  the  Fayette  County  side  was 
erected  by  William  Smith.  Early  merchants  were  P. 
Shawhan,  William  Stewart,  and  John  Birdsall.  John 
Crane  was  the  early  blacksmith.  His  dwelling  was 
in  Payette  County,  but  the  shop  was  in  Rush.  An 
early  cabinet-maker,  who  had  a  turning- lathe  and 
manufactured  chairs, tables, bureaus,etc.,  was  Jno.Oarr. 

Falmouth  is  a  station  on  the  Jeffersonville,  Mad- 
ison &amp;  Indianapolis  Railroad,  whose  depot  is  in  Fay- 
ette County.  The  inhabitants  probably  number  150 
and  on  the  Fayette  County  side  are  located  a  drug- 
store, a  dry- goods  store,  a  cabinet  making  and  under- 
taking shop,  and  one  carpenter  shop.

BIOGRAPHIES. 


CONNERSYILLE    CITY. 


DAVID  W.  ANDRE,  retired  druggist  and  phar- 
macist, Connersville,  is  a  native  of  Pennsylvania, 
born  in  Lebigh  County,  April  26,  1836,  and  is 
descended  from  a  prominent  Alsatian  family.  His 
father,  Nicholas  Andre  (known  in  the  records  of 
Maschweiler  and  Rischweiler,  at  Maschweiler,  Alsace, 
as  George  Jacob),  was  a  son  of  George  Jacob  Andre, 
who  for  many  years  held  a  prominent  sinecure  in  that 
Province  lapon  the  civil  list  of  France-  He  entered 
the  birth  of  Nicholas  Andre  upon  the  records  the  day 
following  his  birth  (February  21,  1806,)  as  George 
Jacob,  but  subsequently  had  it  changed  to  Nicholas. 
He  married  Louisa  Weber,  of  Winschberg,  Alsace, 
who  was  born  June  '27,  1812,  and  died  here  Janu- 
ary 31,  1883,  followed  by  her  esteemed  husband 
November  8,  1884.  They  are  buried  in  Connersville 
Cemetery,  the  family  burial  place.  They  came  to 
America  in  1832  and  located  in  Lehigh  County, 
Penn.,  and  in  1855  removed  to  Indiana.  The  subject 
of  this  sketch  is  prominent  in  the  list  of  Connerville's 
representative  men,  and  is  in  fact  a  "self-made  man." 
He  acquired  a  good  rudimentary  education  in  the 
public  schools  and  applied  it  to  teaching,  in  which 
profession  he  was  very  successful.  January  1,  1857, 
he  entered  upon  the  study  of  pharmacy  at  Brookville 
with  D.  V.  Johnson,  where  he  remained  till  the  begin- 
ning of  1858  in  close  application  to  that  study. 
Leaving  there  he  went  to  Indianapolis,  where  he  com- 
pleted it.  Returning  to  Brookville  he  entered  the  store 
of  John  King  as  clerk,  with  whom  he  remained  in 
reputable  connection  till  1860,  when  he  engaged  with 
S.  H.  Heshour,  of  Cambridge  City,  Ind.,  and  clerked 
for  him  three  years.  In  1863  be  returned  to  Brook- 
ville and  embarked  in  business  for  himself  (buying 
out  D.  V.  Johnson),  which  he  successfully  carried  on 
till  1868,  when  he  retired  from  business  there  and 
came  to  Connersville  and  opened  a  drug  business  Sep- 
tember 1,  1868,  with  which  he  continued  in  active 
connection  till  1881.  Since  coming  here  he  has  taken 
a  very  prominent  part  in  the  encouragement  and  sup- 


port of  many  of  Connersville' s  important  industries, 
and  has  always  lent  a  helping  hand  to  the  building  up 
of  social  institutions.  Mr.  Andre  has  always  prized 
his  citizenship  here  as  well  as  elsewhere,  and  although 
liberal  in  sentiments,  he  is  an  ardent  champion  of 
principles  which  he  considers  upright  and  honest. 
In  this  he  is  frank,  outspoken  and  free  in  his  expres- 
sions, characteristics  by  which  he  is  well  known  and 
esteemed  by  both  friend  and  foe,  which  probably 
rendered  him  more  eminently  fitted  to  succeed  in 
business,  and  gathered  around  him  substantial 
friends.  Upon  the  breaking  out  of  the  late  Civil  war 
Mr.  Andre  enlisted  his  sympathies  with  the  Union 
cause,  and  subsequently  took  very  active  measures  in 
the  enrollment  and  organization  of  the  Nineteenth 
Indiana  Battery  of  Artillery,  and  was  unanimously 
elected  to  the  First  Lieutenancy,  but  through  the 
interposition  of  Gov .  Morton  he  was  refused  recog- 
nition, although  this  battery  made  urgent  appeals  in 
his  behalf.  He,  however,  modestly  retired  from  the 
bellicose  arena,  and  although  his  pride  as  a  Union 
citizen  was  humbled,  he  subsequently  contributed  to 
the  general  support  of  the  army.  He  was  married 
December  13,  1864,  to  Rebecca  A.  King,  a  lady  of 
able  attainments,  a  graduate  to  an  honorary  literary 
course  of  study  at  Brookville  College.  She  was  born 
in  Ohio,  June  3,  1844.  Her  father,  John  King,  was 
born  in  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  in  1820;  hermother,  Sarah 
(Barcus)  King,  was  a  native  of  Maryland.  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Andre  are  members  of  the  Presbyterian  Church. 
In  1876  our  subject  found  Connersville  without  an 
opera  house,  so  the  same  year  he  built  a  new  one 
known  as  the  Andre  Opera  House,  of  which  he  is  pro- 
prietor and  manager.  He  is  at  present  Vice-Presi- 
dent of  the  German  Benevolent  Society,  of  which  he 
has  been  an  active  member  some  years.  He  has  been  an 
active  Odd  Fellow  for  the  past  twenty-seven  years,  and 
has  held  prominent  official  positions  in  that  society, 
of  which  he  is  still  an  esteemed  and  honored  member.

a  farm  he  received  only  a  common  school  education. 
In  1837  he  left  horne  and  began  selling  goods  seven 
miles  from  Philadelphia.  In  1838  he  moved  to  Mil- 
ford,  N.  J.,  where  he  remained  in  business  for 
six  years.  In  1844  he  emigrated  to  Tiffin,  Ohio, 
where  he  continued  in  general  merchandising  up  to 
1850.  After  two  years'  rest  he  cast  anchor  in  Con- 
nersville, Ind.,  and  opened  his  present  business, 
which  has  prospered  under  his  careful  management. 
In  1874  he  branched  out  by  taking  part  in  the  organ- 
ization of  the  coffin  factory,  retaining  one-third  inter- 
est, and  was  chosen  Secretary  and  Treasurer  of  the 
institution  (acting  for  about  two  years),  which 
employed  about  fifty  men  and  prospered  until  May, 
1879,  when,  in  two  hours,  fire  closed  out  the  business 
with  a  loss  of  about  eighty  thousand  dollars,  seventy 
per  cent  of  which  was  clear  loss  to  the  company. 
Mr.  Bailey  was  married  in  Republic,  Ohio,  May  30, 
1850,  to  Miss  Martha  A.  Hart,  a  native  of  Ohio.  By 
this  union  two  children  were  born:  Emma  and 
Charles,  latter  now  in  business  at  Rushville,  Ind. 
Our  subject's  wife  died  December  31,  1854,  and  he 
then  married,  June  1,  1856,  Miss  Kate  F.  Scott,  a 
native  of  Connersville,  born  in  September,  1836,  by 
whom  he  has  one  child,  Mary  L. ,  wife  of  W.  H. 
Vandegrift,  division  Superintendent  of  the  Toledo  &amp; 
St.  Louis  Railway,  located  at  Toledo.  Mr.  Bailey 
was  a  member  of  the  School  Board  two  years.  He  is 
a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F.  and  Encampment. 

CHARLES  A.  BALLE,  Connersville,  is  a  native 
of  this  county,  born  in  1858.  He  is  a  son  of  George 
and  Mary  (Rieder)  Balle,  natives  of  Lorraine,  France, 
and  Baden,  Germany,  respectively.  His  father  was 
born  in  1815,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty  one  entered 
the  army  of  his  sovereign,  Louis  Phillipe,  remaining 
in  the  service  thirteen  years.  In  1846  he  married 
Mary  Rieder,  and  by  her  had  six  children:  Charles 
A.,  Mary  (of  the  Annunciation),  Caroline  E.,  John  V., 
Josephine  F.  and  George  William,  the  last  four 
being  deceased.  Mr.  Balle  emigrated  to  America 
with  his  family  in  1853,  and  located  at  Lawrence- 
burg,  Ind.,  where  he  resided  about  one  year,  and  then 
moved  to  Connersville,  where  he  has  since  remained. 
Charles  A.,  our  subject,  grew  up  in  Connersville,  and 
was  educated  in  its  public  schools.  In  1877  he  went 
to  Cincinnati,  where  he  learned  the  tailoring  trade, 
being  engaged  there  till  1882  in  the  employ  of  Peter 
Meyer.  In  August  of  the  latter  year  he  came  to  Con- 
nersville and  opened  a  merchant  tailoring  establish- 
ment in  the  Huston  Hotel  building,  where  he  has 
since  conducted  a  successful  business.     He  carries  a 


full  stock  of  both  foreign  and  domestic  cloths  in  cas- 
simeres,  worsteds,  etc.,  and  well  merits  the  liberal 
patronage  which  he  is  receiving.

WILLIAM  H.  BECK,  pioneer  clothier  and  tailor 
of  Connersville,  was  born  in  Pittsburgh,  Penn.,  July 
30,  1818;  in  early  life  he  received  a  common  school 
education  and  was  brought  up  to  the  occupation  of  a 
tailor.  His  father,  David  Beck,  was  born  in  Lan- 
caster County,  Penn.,  December  18,  1792,  and  was 
married  in  Pittsburgh,  Penn.,  September  30,  1817,  to 
Catharine  Harb,  who  was  born  in  Baltimore,  in  1801. 
May  2,  1820,  they  moved  to  Connersville,  Ind.,  where 
she  died  September  15, 1822,  after  which  David  Beck 
was  twice  married.  By  the  three  marriages  nine 
children  were  born,  five  of  whom,  also  his  three  wives, 
died  before  his  decease.  The  surviving  children  are 
William  H.,  by  the  first  wife;  David  and  Josephine 
by  the  second;  and  N.  J.  by  the  third.  The  father 
resided  upon  the  same  premises  from  1821  until  his 
death, which  occurred  September  21,  1872.  Our  sub- 
ject opened  up  a  tailor  shop  in  Falmouth,  October, 
1841.  He  was  married,  February  22,  1843,  to  Miss 
Christiana  Skillman,  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  born 
October  20,  1820.  By  this  union  two  children  were 
born:  Samuel  W.  and  Charles  D.  Mr.  Beck  was 
elected  County  Treasurer  in  1852,  and  came  to  Con- 
nersville in  the  spring  of  1853;  was  re-elected  in 
1854,  and  filled  both  terms  with  pleasure  and  credit 
to  himself  and  to  the  entire  satisfaction  of  the  peo- 
ple. In  1856  he  opened  up  his  present  enterprise, 
the  firm  being  then  Beck  Bros.  In  1868  he  closed 
out  and  built  the  corner  block  in  which  he  is  now 
doing  business.  In  1869  he  opened  up  again  with 
his  son,  and  sold  out  to  his  brother  in  1870,  with  the 
view  of  leading  a  retired  life;  in  1873  he  re-embarked 
in  active  business  life.  Mr.  Beck  manufactures  and

EDMUND  W.  BURK,  one  of  the  leading  grocers 
of  Connersville,  was  born  in  this  county  in  1841. 
His  father,  Naham  Burk,  was  a  native  of  Windsor, 
Vt.  His  grandparents,  Jonathan  and  Gracia  (Cady) 
Burk,  were  natives  of  Vermont  and  New  Hampshire  re-

about  twenty  years.  He  next  opened  a  general  store, 
and  this  he  successfully  conducted  for  about  twenty- 
five  years.  In  1881  ill  health  compelled  him  to  retire 
from  active  business.  He  has  held  several  positions 
of  public  trust  in  Connersville,  and  been  instrumen- 
tal in  building  up  many  of  its  interests  in  the  matter

W.,  the  subject  of  our  sketch,  was  reared  to  manhood 
in  his  native  town,  where  he  obtained  a  practical  edu- 
cation in  the  public  schools.  His  first  business  vent- 
ure was  a  general  store  in  the  village  of  Fairview, 
where  he  remained  about  one  year.     He  then  returned

BENJAMIN  F.  CLAYPOOL,  lawyer,  Conners- 
ville,  was  born  in  Connersville,  Ind.,  December  12, 
1825;  son  of  Newton  and  Mary  (Kerns)  Claypool, 
natives  of  Virginia  and  Ohio,  respectively,  and  of 
Irish  and  Welsh  extraction.  Newton  Claypool  be- 
came an  early  resident  of  Connersville,  figuring  prom- 
inently in  its  history  and  that  of  the  county  (fur- 
ther notice  of  him  will  be  found  in  the  history  prop- 
er of  the  city),  and  our  subject  resided  here  until 
1836,  at  which  time,  his  parents  moving  to  a  farm 
one  mile  north  (now  the  home  of  A.  B.  Claypool),  he 
there  lived  until  he  entered  college  in  1843,  having 
in  the  meantime  received  instruction  in  the  old  semi- 
nary, under  the  guidance  of  Harvey  Nutting,  who,  in 
addition  to  the  usual  branches  taught  in  such  schools, 
gave  lessons  in  the  French  and  Latin  languages. 
These  advantages  Mr.  Claypool  improved,  and  being 
fond  of  the  Latin  language,  he  became  quite  profi 
cient  in  it  before  going  to  college.  He  entered  Asbury 
University  at  Greencastle,  Ind.,  in  1843.  He  pursued 
a  course  in  the  classics  and  Belles-lettres  which  was 
completed  two  years  later.  In  1845  our  subject,  en- 
tering the  office  of  the  late  Hon.  O.  H.  Smith,  at  In- 
dianapolis, read  law  under  that  gentleman,  and  was 
admitted  to  the  bar  in  1847.  In  the  same  year  he  lo- 
cated in  the  city  of  his  nativity,  where  he  commenced 
practice.  By  study  and  close  application  to  business 
he  soon  took  rank  with  the  foremost  lawyers  of 
Whitewater  bar,  then  represented  by  some  of  the 
most  brilliant  in  the  State.  From  that  time  to  the 
present  he  has  maintained  the  position  attained,  and 
during  the  long  period  has  been  engaged  in  many  of 
the  important  cases  tried  at  the  Fayette  courts.  It 
is  only  justice  to  Mr.  Claypool  to  here  state  that  he 
is  not  only  the  oldest  resident  member  of  the  bar,  but 
the  most  prominent.  Until  the  organization  of  the 
Republican  party  he  was  identified  with  the  Whigs, 
since  which  time  he  has  affiliated  with  the  former, 
lu  1856  he  was  a  delegate  to  the  National  Conven- 
tion at  Philadelphia  that  nominated  John  G.  Fre- 
mont; in  1864  he  was  a  Presidential  elector  in  the 
Fifth  Congressional  District;  and  in  1868  one  of  the 
Electors  for  the  State  at  large.  In  1860  he  was  elect- 
ed State  Senator  for  the  counties  of  Fayette  and 
Union,  and  as  such  served  during  the  exciting  times 
of  the  Rebellion,  favoring  at  all  times  a  vigorous 
prosecution  of  the  war.  He  is  an  earnest,  forcible 
speaker  at  the  bar  and  on  the  stump,  one  of  decided 
convictions,  and  fearless  in  the  expression  of  them. 
For  several  years  prior  to  the  close  of  the  branch  of 
the  State  Bank  at  Connersville,  ]\Ii-.  Claypool  served 
as  its  President,  and  was  subsequently  President  of 


the  First  National  Bank  of  the  same  city,  from  its 
organization  until  1873.  In  1874  he  was  the  Repub- 
lican nominee  for  Congress  in  the  Fifth  District,  but 
was  defeated.  On  August  4,  1853,  our  subject  was 
married  to  Alice  Helm,  a  daughter  of  Jefferson  Helm, 
M.  D.,  of  Rush  County,  and  to  this  union  were  born 
a  son  and  daughter. 

SAMUEL  M.  COOK,  proprietor  of  the  Buckley 
House,  corner  of  Fifth  and  Eastern  Avenue,  Conners-

County,  where  Mr.  Cook  died  in  1861 ;  his  widow  now 
resides  in  Huntsville,  Madison  Co.,  Ind.  Our  sub- 
ject had  a  good  common  school  education,  acquiring 
same  by  close  application  to  books  at  night,  denying 
himself  enjoyment  with  playmates  in  order  to  store 
his  mind  with  useful  knowledge,  which  he  imparted 
to  others,  as  teacher,  when  nineteeeu  years  of  age,  an 
avooation  he  followed  for  some  time.  He  was  mar- 
ried January  2,  1862,  to  Miss  Lydia  E.  Nicholson, 
who  was  born  in  Madison  County,  Ind.,  October  9, 
1840,  daughter  of  George  and  Susannah  (Brown) 
Nicholson,  the  former  of  whom  was  born  in  Clinton 
County,  Ohio,  August  13,  1817,  died  January  13,

aad  also  assisted  in  manufacturing  the  brick  for  the 
arsenal.  In  1865  they  moved  to  Plaintield,  where  he 
engaged  ia  the  grocery  business,  after  which  he  em- 
barked in  the  manufacture  of  tile,  which  enterprise 
not  proving  satisfactory  he  branched  out  into  the  gro- 
cery and  hardware  trade  with  success.  In  1876  he 
purchased  the  Mansion  House  and  with  the  assistance 
of  his  accomplished  wife  kept  a  comfortable  home  for 
the  traveling  public  in  addition  to  his  other  lucrative 
enterprise.  In  October,  1880,  they  left  Plainfield 
and  took  up  their  abode  in  Danville,  where  they  kept 
the  Mansion  House  and  a  grocery  business  until  Au- 
gust, 1882,  at  which  time  they  moved  to  the  city  of

1816.  His  parents  were  Joseph  and  Mary  (Cramer) 
Cotton,  who  were  born  and  reared  in  Greenville  Dis- 
trict. S.  C,  and  here  they  were  married  at  the  ages  of 
nineteen  years,  enjoying  each  other's  society  as 
husband  and  wife  sixty-two  years,  being  the  parents 
of  eleven  children.  His  father  was  born  May  9, 
1787,  and  his  mother  April  12  of  the  same  year. 
The  gi-andsires  on  both  sides  (William  Cotton  and 
Absalom  Cramer)  were  soldiers  of  the  Revolutionary 
war.  Joseph  Cotton  with  hia  wife  and  four  children 
came  to  Indiana  in  1816,  and  located  in  Franklin 
County,  where  he  remained  fourteen  years,  then 
changed  over  into  Fayette  County,  where  he  re- 
mained forty-three  years.  He  was  a  life-long 
farmer,  and  died  May  8,  1873.  Mrs.  Cotton  passed 
away  September  11,  1868.  William  Cotton,  whose 
name  heads  this  sketch,  resided  with  his  parents  until 
about  twenty-two  years  of  age,  when  he  purchased  105 
acres  of  land  in  this  county  and  began  operations  for 
himself.  By  excessive  labor  in  improving  this  farm 
and  on  Whitewater  Canal,  which  was  being  con- 
structed at  that  time,  he  lost  his  health  in  two  years. 
Having  obtained  a  fair  education  in  the  common 
schools,  he  abandoned  the  farm  and  took  up  the  pro- 
fession of  teaching,  which  he  continued  twenty-one 
years,  laying  aside  his  armor  in  1861.  He  read  med- 
icine two  years  (1847  and  1848)  with  Dr.  Kitchen,  but 
never  practiced.  July  25,  1861,  he  enlisted  in  the 
Third  Indiana  Cavalry,  Company  F,  and  entered  the 
war,  serving  three  years,  and  participating  in  some  of 
the  most  important  engagements  of  the  entire  struggle. 
He  enlisted  as  private  and  was  honorably  discharged 
August  31,  1864,  as  Second  Lieutenant,  having  been 
in  the  command  of  a  company  some  time  before  the 
discharge  of  the  regiment.  Es-Gov.  Conrad  Baker 
was  the  first  Colonel  of  the  Third  Indiana  Cavalry, 
afterward  Col.  Scott  Carter,  of  Vevay,  who  resigned 
in  the  early  part  of  1863.  Gen  George  H.  Chapman, 
who  had  been  with  the  regiment  soon  after  its    being 


sent  out,  as  Major,  was  the  last  Colonel  in  command 
of  the  regiment.  Maj.  William  Patton,  of  Vevay,  was 
in  command  of  the  regiment  at  the  time  of  discharsre. 
On  his  return  from  the  war  in  the  fall  of  1864,  Mr. 
Cotton  was  elected  Sheriff  of  the  county,  and  served 
two  terms,  being  chosen  County  Treasurer  for  the 
same  length  of  time.  In  1873  fiaancial  troubles  over- 
took him,  but,  unlike  many,  not  the  shadow  of  equiv- 
ocation was  exhibited,  while  thousands  of  honest  earn- 
ings were  absorbed  in  paying  others'  debts.  In  1878 
he  was  elected  City  Marshal  of  Connersville  and 
served  two  terms,  tendering  his  resignation  after  a 
third  election.  After  closiag  his  official  career  Mr. 
Cotton  spent  the  summer  and  fall  in  Arkansas,  where 
he  purchased  lands,  and  since  tliat  time  has  given  up 
active  business.  April  6,  1843,  he  was  married  to 
Christiann  Goodwise,  who  died  about  two  and  one- 
half  years  later,  leaving  one  daughter.  March  4, 
1848,  he  was  united  in  marriage  with  Miss  Drusilla 
C.  Utter,  and  in  1854  this  wife  was  also  called  to  her 
eternal  rest,  leaving  two  daughters  and  one  son. 
Left  with  three  little  daughters  and  one  little  son, 
Mr.  Cotton  was  necessitated  to  break  up  house  keep- 
ing and  board.  In  1856,  while  boarding  his  little 
family,  he  spent  one  year  in  his  parents'  native  State, 
visiting  the  old  plantations  and  residences  where  his 
parents  were  born,  roared  and  married.  While  there 
he  was  engaged  in  his  profession,  teaching. 
Brother  Cotton  (as  he  was  called)  has  been  quite  un- 
fortunate with  his  family,  having  lost  by  death  three 
daughters  and  one  son.  He  has  only  one  daughter  and 
little  son  living.  His  present  wife  was  Mrs.  Mary  F. 
Smith  (nee  Webb),  to  whom  he  was  married  May  20, 
1874,  and  by  this  union  were  born  one  daughter  and 
one  son,  the  daughter  deceased,  as  heretofore  indi- 
cated. Mr.  Cotton  is  a  member  of  the  G.  A.  R.  He 
has  been  associated  with  the  Christian  congregation 
since  he  was  twenty-three  years  of  age.  He  has  been 
quite  an  active  worker  in  local  politics,  casting  his 
vote  with  the  Reiiublicanson  all  questions  of  general 
issue,  and  his  long  official  service  is"  the  best  evidence 
to  be  given  as  to  his  personal  character  as  a  man,  or 
his  public  character  as  a  citizen. 

WILSON  T.  DALE,  lumber  dealer,  Connersville, 
was  born  in  Harrison  Township,  near  Harrisburg,  Fay- 
ette Co.,  Ind.,  October  29,  1824.  He  was  raised  on  a

tober 26,  1793.  They  immigrated  to  Kentucky 
in  a  very  early  day,  and  the  Indians  being 
numerous  and  daagerous,  they  had  to  move 
into  Craig's  Station  for  safety.  They  came  to  this 
county    in   1814,   where   the   mother  died  June   11,

engaged  in  wagon  and  carriage- making.  During  the 
first  year  of  the  Rebellion  (1861)  he  made  for  the 
Government  100  army  wagons  in  six  weeks,  which 
consumed  all  his  material  and  necessitated  his  closing 
up  the  business.  In  1862  he  commenced  buying  and 
selling  lumber,  at  which  he  has  continued  ever  since, 
lu  1864  he  was  elected  Justice  of  the  Peace,  and  has 
been  re-elected  four  times  since,  making  five  terms, 
or  twenty  years'  service  withoui  cessation,  which 
shows  conclusively  that  he  enjoys  the  respect  and  con- 
fidence of  his  neighbors  and  friends.  He  is  a  mem- 
ber of  the  I.  O.  O.  F.,  Subordinate  and  Encampment;

BIOGKAPIIIES. 


JOHN  FARNER,  deceased,  late  of  Connersville, 
one  of  the  most  honored  of  Fayette  County's  German 
residents,  was  born  in  Germany,  November  28,  1810. 
His  parents  were  Michael  and  Christian  (Geise)  Far- 
ner,  with  whom  he  remained  till  grown  to  manhood. 
At  the  age  of  twenty  one  years  he  entered  the  amiy 
of  his  sovereign,  in  whose  service  he  continued  live 
years,  obtaining  an  honorable  discharge.  In  1837 
he  immigrated  to  America,  settling  in  Wheeling, 
Va. ;  from  thence  he  went  to  Madison,  Ind.,  and  in 
1842  came  to  Connersville,  where  he  has  since 
resided.  He  was  a  stone  mason  by  trade,  which  ho 
followed  many  years.  He  erected  the  house  in  which 
he  last  lived.  In  1866  Mr.  Farner  was  elected  Coro- 
ner of  this  county,  and  his  faithfulness  in  the  dis- 
charge of  his  duty  was  rewarded  by  nine  successive 
elections  to  the  same  position.  Mr.  Farner  was  mar- 
ried, in  1830,  to  Christine  Klean,  a  native  of  Ger- 
many and  daughter  of  Jacob  Klean,  and  two  children 
were  born  to  them:  Rosina,  who  died  in  childhood, 
and  John,  who  lost  his  life  in  the  service  ot  his  coun- 
try in  the  fall  of  1865.  He  was  a  member  of  the 
Sixty-ninth  Indiana  Infantry,  and  was  drowned  in 
Bayou  McHenry  while  attempting  to  ford  that  body 
of  water.  Ho  was  a  young  man  of  great  promise, 
a  brave  soldier,  and  at  the  time  of  his  death  held  the 
rank  of  Sergeant.  His  untimely  end  was  deeply 
mourned  by  his  parents  and  friends.  Our  subject 
died  in  Connersville,  January  16,  1885,  in  the  seventy- 
fifth  year  of  his  age.  He  was  a  member  of  and

Mr.  Farner  became  a  member  of  the  Masonic  frater- 
nity, and  has  served  in  most  of  its  offices.  He  was 
always  regarded  as  a  man  of  sterling  integrity,  as 
may  be  known  by  the  public  trust  which  the  people 
laid  upon  him  for  so  many  years.  For  thirty-seven 
years  Mr.  Farner  was  the  faithful  agent  of  the  Cincin- 
nati Volksblatt,  a  leading  German  paper  of  that  city.

resided.  In  March,  1839,  Mr.  Fattig  was  offered  a 
home  with  Joshua  Mcintosh,  with  whom  he  afterward

kind  attention  an  own  child  could  claim  from  parents. 
He  was  chiefly  engaged  as  a  carpenter  till  1882,  when 
he  erected  a  store  room  in  Maplewood  and  embarked  in 
mercantile  pursuits.  About  eighteen  months  later  this 
establishment  was  destroyed  by  fire,  since  which  time 
Mr.  Fattig  has  not  been  actively  employed.  In  1859  he 
spent  a  summer  in  the  vicinity  of  Pike's  Peak  among 
the  Rockies,  and  in  1862  he  entered  the  war  as  a  Sutler.

PROF.  JOSIAH  S.  GAMBLE,  Superintendent 
of  Schools  of  Fayette  County,  Connersville.  This 
courteous  and  affable  gentleman  and  popular  educator 
is  a  native  of  Preble  County,  Ohio,  born  near  the 
village  of  Oxford,  February  27,  1834.  He  was  reared 
to  farm  life,  and  received  the  benefit  of  such  primary 
instruction  as  it  was  then  customary  to  give  farmers' 
sons,  but  having  a  thirst  for  knowledge  with  the  desire 
of  a  more  extended  learning  than  such  as  the  common 
schools  afforded,  he,  at  the  age  of  twenty-five,  took 
an  academic  course,  also  a  normal  course  at  Leb- 
anon, Ohio,  and,  in  1857,  began  teaching,  since  which 
time  he  has  devoted  the  greater  part  of  his  life  to 
that  profession,  giving  to  the  cause  of  education 
his  talents  and  energy.  His  experience  in  the  field 
of  learning  has  been  varied,  having  passed  as  an 
instructor  through  the  common  district  school,  the 
high  school,  the  academy  and  the  college,  being  a 
professor  for  one  year  in  Geneva  College,  then  located 
near  Bellefontaine,  Ohio,  and  since  then  near  Beaver 
Falls,  Penn.  In  1875  he  was  elected  County  Super- 
intendent of  the  schools  of  Fayette,  which  position 
he  has  since  filled  with  the  ability  that  had  previouslj'^ 
characterized  his  life  in  matters  of  education.  The 
Professor's  parents  were  Robert  and  Jane  (Neal)  Gam- 
ble, natives  of  the  north  of  Ireland,  born  in  1800. 
In  1827  they  immigrated  to  America,  locating  in 
Preble  County,  Ohio,  where  they  remained  until 
1834,  then  removed  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  where 
they  died,  the  father  in  April,  1876,  and  the  mother 


in  October,  1881.  Under  Prof.  Gamble's  careful 
management  the  schools  of  the  county  have  been 
brought  up  to  a  high  standard,  second  to  none  in  the 
State.  Besides  the  position  he  occupies  in  educa- 
tional matters,  he  is  one  of  the  active  and  enterpris- 
ing business  men  of  Connersville,  where  he  has 
recently  built  an  addition  to  a  fine  large  brick  build- 
ing, in  which  he  is  carrying  on  a  first  class  feed  and 
sale  stable,  and  dealing  in  fine  horses.  He  is  also 
engaged  in  the  grocery  business.  Mr.  Gamble  was 
united  in  marriage,  April  9,  1884,  with  Miss  Martha 
A.  Reed,  a  native  of  Greene  County,  Ohio.  Both  are 
members  of  the  Reformed  Presbyterian  Church. 

JAMES  T.  GENTRY,  proprietor  livery,  sale  and 
feed  stable,  Connersville,  is  a  native  of  Indiana,  born 
in  Hamilton  County,  December  12,  1840,  and  was 
raised  on  a  farm,  receiving  a  common  school  educa- 
tion in  Marion  County.  His  parents,  Thomas  P.  and 
Paulina  (Wright)  Gentry,  natives  of  North  Carolina, 
were  married  in  1836  and  came  to  Indiana.  The  sub- 
ject of  this  sketch  enlisted  in  1864  in  Company  I, 
Twenty-sixth  Indiana  Volunteer  Infantry,  serving  one 
year.  March,  1866,  he  moved  to  Noblesville,  Ind., 
where  he  engaged  in  the  livery  business.  Mr.  Gen- 
try was  married.  May  20,  1866,  to  Miss  Lou  M.  Har- 
ris, of  Franklin  County,  born  August  10, 1841.  Four 
children  were  the  result  of  this  union:  Lena;  Frank, 
born  April  13,  1870,  died  October  15,  1871;  one 
that  died  in  infancy,  and  James  R.  On  March  5, 
1875,  Mr.  Gentry  removed  to  Connersville,  where  he 
has  been  engaged  in  the  livery  business  ever  since. 
He  is  a  member  of  the  G.  A.  R. 

V.  H.  GREGG,  physician  and  surgeon,  Conners- 
ville, was  born  in  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  January 
25,  1825,  and  completed  his  education  in  select 
school  at  Baechy  Grove.  His  parents,  Joseph  M. 
and  Matilda  (Hamilton)  Gregg,  were  born  in  Ken- 
tucky, where  the  father  died  in  1838.  The  widow 
and  family  came  to  Indiana  in  1844,  where  our  sub- 
ject followed  farming.  He  was  married  in  Fayette 
County,  in  1847,  to  Miss  America  Justice,  daughter 
of  Joseph  Justice,  a  pioneer  and  native  of  Pennsyl- 
vania, and  whose  ancestors  took  part  in  the  Revolu- 
tionary war.  Our  subject  not  being  contented  on  the 
farm,  read  medicine  uuder  W.  W.  Taylor,  M.  D. , 
and  began  practicing  in  1852  at  Vienna  (now  known 
as  Glenwood).  In  1858  he  moved  to  Connersville, 
where,  by  strict  attention  to  business,  he  soon  built 
up  a  large  and  lucrative  practice.  In  March,  1864, 
he  was  appointed  Surgeon  of  First  Brigade,  First 
Division,  Twenty- third  Army  Corps,  with  rank  of 
Major,  serving  until  the  close  of  the  war.  In  1869 
he  was  appointed  Internal  Revenue  Assessor  and 
served  two  and  a  half  years.  He  is  a  member  of  the  G.

and  our  subject  was  married  on  second  occasion, 
June  30;  1875,  to  Miss  Kathleen  Reese,  a  native  of 
Missouri,  born  in  1844.  Mr.  Griffis  is  the  true  type 
of  a  successful  and  prosperous  business  man. 

ORLANDO  P.  GRIFFITH,  member  of  firm  O. 
P.  Griffith  &amp;  Co.,  dealers  in  hardware,  agricultural 
implements,  hubs,  spokes,  felloes,  Moline  wagons, 
Columbus  buggies,  coal,  etc.,  etc..  No.  445  Central 
Avenue  and  Fifth  Street,  Connersville,  is  a  native  of 
Scott  County,  Ky.,  born  February  6,  1847;  son  of 
William  B.  and  Permelia  F.  (Osborn)  Griffith,  also 
natives  of  Kentucky,  and  who  immigrated  to  Indiana 
December  6,  1862,  the  father  being  a  retired  farmer 


and  trader.  Our  subject  received  a  collegiate  course 
at  Brookville,  Ind.  He  was  married  December  23, 
1874,  to  Miss  Jennie  M.  Parry,  born  near  Laurel, 
Franklin  Co.,  Ind.,  March  10,  1856,  daughter  of  T.

on  his  farm  a  herd  of  pedigreed  cattle  of  which  he 
expects  to  make  a  specialty  in  the  future.  Being 
reared  upon  a  farm,  his  education  enables  him  to 
better  understand  and  supply  the  demands  of  an 
intelligent  community.  Owing  to  his  careful  and  pru- 
dent management  in  connection  with  keen  percepti- 
bility, all  enterprises  with  which  he  is  interested 
prosper  and  yield  handsome  results.  Mr.  Griffith  is 
a  R.  A.  M.  He  and  his  estimable  wife  are  members

JOSEPH  G.  GROFF,  manufacturer  and  inventor, 
Connersville,  was  born  in  Asbury,  Warren  Co.,  N.  J., 
February  20,  1820,  and  is  a  son  of  Francis  and  Sarah 
(Carr)  Groflf,  natives  of  New  Jersey,  the  former  born 
February  16,  1792,  the  latter  May  15,  1798.  In 
1839  they  moved  over- land  to  Wheeling,  Va.,  with 
their  nine  children  and  one  adopted  child.  At  this 
point  he  secured  transportation  for  his  family  on 
the  steamer  "Embassy"  to  St.  Louis,  thence  to  Boon- 
ville.  Mo.,  where  he  lived  for  some  time.  The  mias- 
matic influences  of  an  undeveloped  country  brought 
sickness  in  his  family,  and  thia,  together  with  general 
dissatisfaction  with  the  country,  caused  a  speedy 
return  eastward,  and  for  a  short  time  he  "pitched  his 
tent"  at  Lawrenceburg,  Ind.,  where  his  youngest 
child,  Jacob, died.  Dissatisfied  still  with  his  surround- 
ings and  being  without  prospects,  he  again  "  folded 
his  tent"  and  wended  his  way  to  Cambridge  City,  Ind. 
The  following  year,  1840,  he  settled  near  Conners- 
ville, on  the  old  Daniel  Hankins  farm,  now  owned  by 
Charles  Huber.  Here  he  lived  till  all  wanderings 
had  ceased  and  all  troubles  were  over,  dying  on  the 
9th  day  of  September,  1845.  His  estimable  widow 
survived  the  early  companion  of  her  life  a  quarter  of 
a  century,  and  reached  her  final  end  March  10,  1870. 
Of  their  large  family  three  daughters  and  one  son 
survive.  The  early  boyhood  of  "  Uncle  Joe",  as  he  is 
familiarly  called,  was  passed  in  the  manner  usual  to

youth.     He  had  no  college  or  seminary  to  look  to,  as 
a  means  of  education.     The  primitive  schools  of  an 
unsettled  country  were  the  only  institutions  of  learn- 
ing to  -which  he  had  access.      Being  fond  of  sport  he 
combined   business  with    pleasure,    and  engaged  in 
netting  wild  pigeons,  of  which  he  had  sometimes  as 
high  as  1,000  dozen,  caged  in  barns,  cribs  and  other 
buildings.     Of  these  birds  he  took  a  wagon-load  of 
108    dozen    in    May,    to   Cincinnati,    for   which   he 
received  the  magnificent  sum  of  $108.     After  attain- 
ing  his    majority,  he  located    in    Connersville,   and, 
undaunted  by  the  frowns  of  the  world,  being  a  penni- 
less boy,  he  accepted  employment  for  his  board  in  a 
hotel,  with  privilege  of  attending  school  taught  by 
"Uncle  Harvey"  Nutting.    January  1,  1844,  he  entered 
the  employ  of  George  Frybarger,  general  merchant, 
receiving  for  a  year's  services  $100  and  board,  and  at 
the  end  of  the  year  was  $65  ahead  of  his  personal 
expenses.      In  1845,  being  employed  by  Henry  Good- 
lander,  County  Treasurer,  to  collect  the   delinquent 
taxes,  he  traversed  the  county  on  horseback,  collect- 
ing   same,    after   which    he    carried     on    horseback 
between  $5,000  and  $6,000  on  his  person,  to  Indian- 
apolis, and  made  settlement  with  the  State  Treasurer. 
In  the  fall  of  the  same  year  he  accepted  a  situation 
with  Witherel  &amp;  Frances  in  general  mercantile  busi- 
ness.    He  enjoyed  fully  the  confidence  of  his  employ- 
ers, who  early  recognized  the  soundness  of  his  judg- 
ment.    In  1846  he  was  permitted  to  go  to  Philadel- 
phia to  purchase  a  stock  of  goods  for  their  house,  and 
trade.   In  1848  he  succeeded  to  an  interest  in  the  firm 
which  then  became  Groff  &amp;  Witherel,  continuing  as 
such    till  January  1,    1850.      Confinement  in-doors, 
with  a  too  close  application  to  business,  made  serious 
inroads    on    his   naturally   good   health,  compelling 
relinquishment  from  labor  to  seek  recuperation  in  the 
open  air,  which  he  effectually  did  by  several  months' 
sport   with  gun  and   fishing  rod.       With  returning 
health  came  back  the  old  ambition  that  had  gone  out 
with  wasting  energies,  and  he  purchased  E.   Camp- 
bell's stock  of  goods,  which  at  the  time  was  some- 
what run  down.       His  means   being    inadequate   to 
replenish,   Henry  Goodlander  and  the  Hon.  Newton 
Claypool,  his   first   endorsers,   endorsed  for   him    to 
amount    of    $1,000     in    a    Richmond    bank.       Part 
of  1856  and  1857  he  rented  and  operated  the  flour- 
ing-mill    now    owned    and    run    by   Wetherald    &amp; 
Sons.     In  1857  he  disposed  of  his  store  business  and 
immediately  opened  a  confectionery,  bakery  and  eat- 
ing-house, which  proved  a  source  of  profit  for  twenty- 
four  years;  he  disposed  of  his  business  May  11,  1881, 
together  with  all  other  business  cares.     Once  outside 
all    business   restraint,    he    gave    free    rein   to   the 
natural  bent   or   inclination  of   his  mind,   and    the 
inventive  genius   that   had   been    smothered    in  the 


struggle  for  accumulation,  burst  forth  with  all  the 
glow  and  ardor  of  youth.  His  fertile  mind  at  once 
devised  the  humane  invention  calculated  to  protect 
the  operators  of  buzz-saws  from  accident.  For  three 
years  he  labored  untiringly,  having  secured  ten  let- 
ters patent,  and  has  one  more  now  pending.  The 
invention  is  now  perfected  to  a  nicety,  is  self-adjust- 
ing, eifective,  and  will  afibrd  absolute  protection  to  all 
manipulators  of  the  deadly  buzz  saw.  In  October  of 
1882  he  associated  with  him  Augustus  A.  Bennett,  of 
the  firm  Kitridge  &amp;  Co.,  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  for  the 
manufacture  of  the  Uncle  Joe's  saw  guard.  The  firm, 
which  is  named  the  Groff  &amp;  Bennett  Saw  Guard 
Manufacturing  Company,  of  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  has 
extensive  manufacturing  facilities  of  the  highest  orden 
and  can  on  short  notice  supply  every  demand  of  the 
trade.  Mr.  Groff  has  been  twice  married.  His  first 
wife  {nee  Nancy  J.  Minor),  was  born  in  Union  County, 
Ind, ,  October  6,  1831.  Their  marriage  was  consum- 
mated September  26,  1850.  Two  children  were  born 
to  this  union,  Luella  and  Mabel,  latter  of  whom  died 
August  22,  1859,  aged  ten  months  and  twenty- six 
days.  Mrs.  Groff  died  November  1,  1861,  and  our 
subject's  second  marriage  was  celebrated  September 
9,  1863,  with  Nancy  J.  Moyer,  who  was  born  in  Lima, 
Ohio,  September  25,  1844.  Four  children  have  been 
born  to  them,  Edwin  G. ,  Mabel,  Louie  and  Erla. 

SAMUEL  N.  HAMILTON,  M.  D.,  Connersville, 
was  born  near  Fayetteville,  this  county,  November 
23,  1845,  son  of  Elijah  and  Mary  J.  (Smith)  Ham- 
ilton, former  a  native  of  Ohio,  latter  of  this  county. 
The  Doctor  was  engaged  in  farming  until,  April  8, 
1863,  (then  quite  a  youth)  he  enlisted  in  Company  L, 
Third  Indiana  Cavalry,  serving  iintil  July  20,  1865, 
when  he  was  mustered  out  at  Lexington,  N.  C,  and 
discharged  following  August.  He  participated  in 
the  celebrated  march  to  the  sea,  and  was  through  the 
Carolinas  with  the  Third  Cavalry  Division,  Gen. 
Kilpatrick's  command.  Returning  home,  our  subject 
commenced  his  education,  attending  school  for  follow- 
ing three  years.  Ho  then  taught  for  a  time,  reading 
medicine  during  vacations  and  such  spare  time  as  he 
could  find  while  teaching.  He  attended  Indiana 
Medical  College  term  of  1872  and  1873;  went  to 
Texas  early  in  1874,  returning  home  latter  part  of 
same  year;  took  a  medical  lecture  course  and  gradu- 
ated in  1875.  In  1876  the  Doctor  returned  to  Texas, 
making  his  home  on  the  Colorado  River,  some  twenty 
miles  above  Austin,  and  dwelt  among  the  people  of 
the  mountains,  practicing  the  healing  art.  On  March 
22,  1877,  our  subject  married  Miss  Mary  E.  Haire, 
born  April  19,  1858,  near  Greenfield,  Mo.,  but  resid- 
ing at  time  of  her  marriage  at  Smithton,  Mo.  To 
this  union  have  been  born  two  boys:  Eugene  Everett, 
born   January  9,  1879,    and   Arthur   Mazzini,    born

October  2,  1884.  In  the  spring  of  1877  Doctor 
Hamilton  moved  to  this  county  and  located  at  Ever- 
ton,  where  he  practiced  medicine  until  1880.  He 
then  went  to  Schell  City,  Mo.,  but  owing  to  the  poor 
health  of  his  family  he  retiu'ned  to  Everton  (where 
he  had  formerly  practiced  in  1881)  and  there  re- 
mained till  June  3,  1882,  at  which  date  he  moved  to 
Connersville  and  formed  a  partnership  with  Dr.  V. 
H.  Gregg,  in  general  practice  of  medicine  and  sur- 
gery. Our  subject  is  a  member  of  the  County  Dis- 
trict and  State  Medical  Societies;  he  is  a  member  of

CAPT.  JOHN  W.  HANNAH,  dealer  in  dry  goods, 
groceries,  notions,  etc.,  Eighth  Street,  between  West- 
ern Avenue  and  Walnut  Street,  Conaersville,  is  a 
native  Hoosier,  born  in  Rush  County,  June  5,  1838, 
son  of  James  and  Susannah  (Peterson)  Hannah,  who

JAMES  HERON  (deceased)  was  formerly  a  busi- 
ness man  of  high  standing  in  the  city  of  Conners- 
ville. He  was  born  in  Baltimore,  Md.,  June  10,  1825, 
and  settled  in  this  community  with  his  parents  in 
1837.  His  mother  is  still  living,  aged  eighty-five. 
He  was  educated  in  Oxford  College,  Ohio,  and  was 
early  initiated  into  business  life.  In  1845  he  assisted 
in  engineering  the  Whitewater  Valley  Canal  and  was 
subsequently  appointed  Secretary  and  Treasurer  of 
the  company,  serving  in  that  capacity  several  years. 
He  also  assisted  in  locating  and  engineering  the 
Junction  Railroad,  and  was  instrumental  in  securing 
the  location  of  the  W.  W.  V.  R.  R.  on  the  banks  of 
the  canal.      For  twenty  years  Mr.   Heron  was  con- 


nected with  the  pork-packing  interests  of  Conners- 
ville, being  associated  with  all  the  various  firms  from 
George  Frybarger  &amp;  Co.,  down  to  Caldwell,  McCann

daughter  of  Hon.  Enoch  McCarty,  a  native  of  Cul- 
peper  County,  Va. ,  where  he  was  born  January  5, 
1783,  and  soon  after  his  birth  his  parents  removed  to 
Tennessee,  where  he  lived  till  the  general  immigration 
set  in  for  the  country  northwest  of  the  Ohio,  when  he 
moved  to  the  Whitewater  Valley.  Mr.  McCarty  was 
then  just  in  the  prime  of  young  manhood,  and  his 
many  excellent  qualities  soon  pointed  him  out  as  a 
public  servant.  He  was  first  made  Justice  of  the 
Peace,  and  on  the  organization  of  Franklin  County 
was  elected  County  Clerk,  serving  in  that  capacity  at 
difi'erent  times  for  about  twenty  years.  He  assisted 
in  framing  the  State  Constitution  in  1816;  served 
three  years  as  State  Senator,  two  terms  as  Represent- 
ative, and  seventeen  years  as  Associate  Judge. 
Through  his  entire  official  career  he  was  distinguished 
for  the  wisdom  of  his  policies  and  the  integrity  of 
his  jjurposes.  He  was  also  a  brother  of  Gen.  Jona. 
than  McCarty.  A  second  daughter  of  Mr.  McCarty 
became  the  wife  of  thebrotherof  Hiram  Powers,  the 
celebrated  sculptor.  By  his  union  with  Miss  Mc- 
Carty Mr.  Heron  became  the  father  of  three  children. 
He  died  June  19,  1876,  mourned  by  many  warm 
friends  and  business  associates.  His  son,  James  M., 
has  been  identified  with  the  business  interests  of  Con- 
nersville for  the  past  six  years.  He  was  born  in 
Connersville,  was  given  the  advantages  of  the  public 
schools  of  Connersville,  also  two  years'  study  in  the 
public  schools  and  Chickering  Institute  of  Cincin- 
nati. He  abandoned  his  literary  pursuits  on  account 
of  failing  health,  and  in  1875  engaged  with  Q.  A. 
Mount  as  salesman  in  a  boot  and  shoe  store.  In 
1879  he  purchased  Mr.  Mount's  interest,  and  since 
that  date  has  conducted  the  business  at  the  old  Mount 
stand  in  partnership  with  his  sister  Kate.  He  was 
married,  in  June,  1882,  to  Miss  Nanna  Dolph,  daughter 
of  Rev.  E.  L.  Dolph,  Presiding  Elder  of  the  Methodist 
Episcopal  Southeast  Indiana  District  Conference.

JOHN  M.  HIGGS,  editor  and  proprietor  of  the 
Examiner,  office  opposite  court  house  on  Central 
Avenue,  Connersville,  was  born  in  Franklin  County, 
Ind.,  near  Halstead's  Mills,  April  5,  1841,  and  com- 
pleted his  education  at  Brookville,  where  he  resided 
until  1859.  During  the  last  five  years  of  his  abode 
in  that  village  he  learned  the  printing  business  and 
worked  under  C.  B.  Bentley,  editor  of  the  Democrat ;

then  moved  to  Coniiersville  and  purchased  the  old 
Telegraph  oiBce,  continuing  its  publication  for  two 
and  a  half  years,  at  which  time  he  sold  out  and  en- 
listed, September  18,  1861,  in  Company  L,  Second 
Indiana  Cavalry,  under  Col.  Bridgeland,  serving 
three  years  in  the  Army  of  the  Cumberland,  partic- 
ipating in  the  battles  of  Perryville,  Shiloh,  Chicka- 
mauga  and  Gallatin,  Tenn.  In  the  last-named  en- 
gagement his  company  was  captured  by  John  Morgan, 
but,  not  being  satisfied  with  their  new  commander,  cut 
their  way  out,  losing  nine  men,  killed  and  wounded. 
After  returning  home  Mr.  Higgs  resided  two  years  in 
Indianapolis;  then,  in  1808,  came  to  Connersville  and 
started  the  Examiner,  a  six-column  paper,  with  an 
entire  new  outfit.  By  strict  attention  to  business, 
and  carefully  studying  the  demands  of  the  people, 
patronage  so  increased  that  in  1882  he  was  compelled 
to  increase  the  size  of  the  paper  to  nine  columns,  and 
add  presses  which  would  enable  him  to  do  job  work 
with  neatness  and  dispatch.  The  enterprise  has 
proved  a  success,  and  as  a  reward  for  his  labor  the 
Examiner  has  the  largest  circulation  of  any  paper 
in  this  part  of  the  State.  Mr.  Higgs  was  married 
October  31,  1861,  to  Miss  Kate  I.  Davis,  who  was 
born  in  New  Paris,  Ohio.  In  1873  our  subject  was 
elected  to  the  City  Council  from  the  Second  Ward; 
in  1876  he  was  a  candidate  for  County  Treasurer  and 
received  more  votes  than  any  Democrat  ever  did  in 
the  county,  lacking  only  ninety-nine  votes  of  election. 
He  is  a  member  of  the  G.  A.  R. 

HON.  JAMES  N.  HUSTON,  banker,  farmer,  stock- 
dealer,  manufacturer  and  Legislator,  Connersville.  This 
enterprising  and  public-spirited  young  man  is  the 
son  of  William  and  Isabella  E.  (Duncan)  Huston, 
the  ancestors  of  both  of  whom  were  Scotch-Irish. 
The  father  was  born  in  Franklin  County,  Penn., 
Septembers,  1801;  was  married  in  18-17  and  removed 
to  Connersville,  Ind.,  in  1851.  He  was  for  years  en- 
gaged in  farming  and  milling,  being  associated  in  busi- 
ness both  in  Pennsylvania  and  in  Connersville  with  his 
brother  James.  In  1870  William  Huston  with  oth- 
ers opened  in  Connersville  a  private  bank  known  as 
the  Citizens'  Bank,  with  which  he  was  connected 
until  his  death,  which  occurred  January  5,  1875.  He 
was  a  man  of  unbounded  integrity  of  character,  was 
extremely  scrupulous  in  regard  to  religious  and  moral 
observances,  and  would  permit  of  no  Sabbath  dese- 
cration. Early  in  life  he  united  with  the  Presby- 
terian Church,  of  which  he  lived  a  consistent  and 
zealous  member,  adhering,  after  the  division  in  that 
church,  to  the  Old  School  branch,  serving  as  Elder 
for  half  a  century.  He  was  an  excellent  business 
man,  understanding  human  nature  well;  his  judg- 
ment was  rarely  at  fault.  A  marked  trait  of  his 
character   was  his  great   decision,  reaching   conclu- 


sions quickly.     He  was  an  ardent  Whig   and  subse- 
quently a  Republican,  being  ever  a  great  Anti-slavery 
man.     At  his  death  he  left  a  large  estate.     Our  sub- 
ject, the  only  child  by  the  marriage  spoken  of  above, 
was  born  in  Franklin  County,  Penn.,  May  11,  1849. 
When  but  twenty  days  old  his  mother   died,  and  he 
was  consequently  deprived  of  a  mother's   care  and 
guidance.     He  received  the  benefit  of  a  liberal  edu- 
cation, which    was    completed   at  Miami   University, 
Oxford,  Ohio.      On  the  death  of  his  father,   in  1875, 
Mr.  Huston    became    engaged  in  many  lines  of  busi- 
ness as  his   father's   successor,  in  which  he  has  been 
remarkably  successful.     He  is  one  of  the  most  active, 
enterprising  and  public-spirited  citizens  of  Conners- 
ville, which  city  owes  to  him  a  debt  of  gratitude  for 
the  general  interest  he  has  shown  in  its  development 
and    improvement.      He    was    for  a  period  President 
of    the    Coffin    Company,    Eagle    Milling   Compa- 
ny, and  Silver  Plating  Company,  and  is  now  Pres- 
ident  of    the    Connersville    Buggy   Company,    and 
Western    Hosiery    Mills;    is    interested    in  the  Gas 
Works,   Creamery,  Indiana   Furniture   Factory,  be- 
sides various   other    enterprises;    and    is    proprietor 
of  the  Citizens'  Bank.     In  1876  and  1878  Mr.  Hus- 
ton was  chosen  for  the  City  Council  from  the  Second 
Ward.     In  1880  he  was  elected  to  the  State  Legisla- 
ture and   re-elected  in  1882,  receiving  a  strong   sup- 
port from  the  laboring  classes,  for  whom  he  ever  feels 
a  deep  sympathy;  was  elected  from   the  district  com- 
prising the  Counties  of  Fayette,  Rush  and  Union,  by 
a  majority  of  1,960,  to  the  State  Senate,  November  4, 
1884.     Mr.  Huston  takes   great   interest  in   matters 
pertaining   to    agricultui'e,  and    being    an    extensive 
land    owner,  he  has    carried  on  farming  by  "  proxy " 
to  a  considerable    extent.     He  has   served  for  a  time 
as  President  of  the  Agricultural  Society.     He  is  now 
serving  as  Chairman  of  the  Republican  Central  Com- 
mittee of    the  county,  which    position   he    filled   in 
1880  and  1882,  and  under  his    management  the  Re- 
publican majority  in  the  county  has   been  increased 
from  290  to  535.     He  takes  an  active  interest  in  tem- 
perance movements,  and  does  not  conceal  his  opinions 
on  the  subject  for  party  considerations.     He  is  a  R. 
A.  M. ;  a  member  of  the  order  of  K.  of  P. 

HEMAN  JONES,  retired  farmer,  Connersville, 
an  old  and  highly  esteemed  pioneer  of  Fayette 
County,  is  a  native  of  New  Hampshire,  born  near 
Hanover,  June  10,  1812.  His  parents,  Nathan  and 
Elizabeth  (Spaulding)  Jones,  were  natives  of  Massa- 
chusetts, of  English  extraction.  In  a  very  early  day 
they  emigrated  to  New  Hampshire,  and  settled  near 
Hanover,  where  they  remained  some  time;  thence  moved 
to  Vermont,  and  subsequently  returned  to  New  Hamp- 
shire, and  in  1820  to  Huron  County,  Ohio,  where 
they  remained  permanently.     They  were  the  parents

Elizabeth,  Enos,  Heman,  Alonzo  and  Lucy.  Heman 
came  with  his  parents  to  the  State  of  Ohio,  and  v?hen 
about  sixteen  years  of  age  went  to  Mount  Vernon, 
where  he  began  as  an  apprentice  to  shoe-making,  and 
subsequently  movod  to  Springlield,  where  he  completed 
his  apprenticeship.  In  1829  he  went  to  Hamilton, 
and  there  remained,  working  at  his  trade  one  winter; 
thence  moved  to  Mason  County,  Ky. ,  and  there  fol- 
lowed his  trade  about  one  year,  and  in  1831  came  to 
Liberty,  Union  Co.,  Ind.,  whero  he  purchased  a  boot 
and  shoe  business.  He  was  there  married,  April  2, 
1835,  to  Lydia  A.,  daughter  of  John  and  Elizabeth 
(Fosdick)  Hughes,  born  in  Campbell  County,  Va. , 
November  2C,  1817,  and  one  of  nine  children,  viz.: 
Mary,  John,  Elizabeth,  Lydia  A.,  Permelia,  Marga- 
ret, William,  Aaron,  and  one  who  died  in  infancy. 
In  October,  1838,  Mr.  Jones  sold  his  boot  and  shoe 
interest  at  Liberty,  and  moved  to  this  county,  where 
he  purchased  eighty  acres  of  land  in  Columbia  Town- 
ship, on  which  he  settled  and  engaged  in  farming, 
and  several  years  later  he  traded  it  for  1(50  acres  in 
the  same  township,  which  he  impi'oved,  and  as  ho 
prospered  he  kept  adding  to  it  until  he  owns  at  pres- 
ent 560  acres  in  this  county,  and  eighty  acres  in  Ben- 
ton County,  Ind.,  and  also  has  money  at  interest,  and 
several  houses  and  lots  in  Connersville.  In  illustra- 
tion of  what  may  be  accomplished  by  energy,  indus- 
try and  well  directed  effort  under  our  free  American 
Government,  may  be  cited  the  career  of  Mr.  Jones, 
who  started  in  life  a  poor  boy,  contending  with  all 
the  disadvantages  and  inconveniences  of  a  new  coun- 
try, he  battled  his  way  up  throl^gh  an  obscure  life, 
and  is  now  one  of  the  wealthy  men  of  Fayette  County. 
He  has  always  led  an  honorable  life,  his  motives  be- 
ing guided  by  the  golden  rule,  "  Do  unto  others  as 
you  would  have  them  do  unto  you."  Our  subject  and 
wife  are  members  of  the  Christian  Church.  They  had 
born  to  them  five  children,  viz.:  Elizabeth  (deceased), 
Mary,  Candas  (deceased),  Anna  (deceased)  and  Cor- 
nelia (deceased).

Eolston,  William  N.  and  John  M.  Our  subject  was 
brought  up  on  a  farm,  where  he  was  employed  till  his 
eighteenth  year,  receiving  an  ordinary  common  school 
education.  He  learned  the  trade  of  carriage  painting 
in  1864  and  this  was  his  chief  occupation  till  1872, 
when  he  took  up  the  art  of  photography.  He  began 
the  latter  business  in  Kokomo,  Ind.,  in  1872.  Mr. 
Kellum  was  twice  married;  on  first  occasion  October 
19,  1869,  to  Alice  Hunt,  of  Hush  County,  who  died 
September  30,  1870,  leaving  one  child,  which  passed 
away  six  months  later,  and  October  16,  1873,  he  was 
married  to  Carrie  Craver,  a  daughter  of  M.  B.  and 
Mary  A.  Craver.  One  child — Claude — has  been  born 
to  them.  In  the  practice  of  his  chosen  art  Mr.  Kel- 
lum has  not  a  rival  in  southeastern  Indiana,  his  work 
in  all  its  details  showing  a  true  perception  of  artistic 
effects,  its  tone  and  finish  being  seldom  surpassed  by 
metropolitan  artists.  His  management  of  light  is 
excellent,  while  the  effect  of  ease  and  grace  in  position 
is  no  less  thoroughly  understood.  In  short,  Mr.  Kel- 
lum stands  well  in  the  front  rank  among  the  members 
of  his  calling,  and  truly  merits  the  liberal  patronage 
which  an  appreciative   public  is  bestowing  upon  him.

CHARLES  MOUNT,  Cashier  of  First  National 
Bank  and  manufacturer,  Connersville,  is  descended 
from  one  of  the  old  and  prominent  families  of  the 
Whitewater  Valley  and  Connersville.  His  parents, 
James  and  Mary  (Dixon)  Mount,  were  natives  of  New 
Jersey  and  Connersville,  respectively,  the  latter  being 
a  daughter  of  Arthur  Dixon,  one  of  the  first  mer- 
chants of  Connersville.  James  Mount  was  born  No- 
vember 9,  1805,  and  in  1818  immigrated  to  Franklin 
County,  Ind.,  locating,  in  1823,  in  Connersville,  where 
he  became  a  prominent   business  man   and  leading 


citizen.  He  was  for  a  time  associated  in  mercantile 
business  with  Daniel  Hankins,  and  subsequently 
with  Meredith  Helm.  He  was  one  of  the  number 
who  built  the  large  brick  structure  on  Eastern  Avenue 
near  the  C,  H.  &amp;  I.  R.  R.,  where  he  opened  a  large 
machine  shop  and  foundry.  He  also,  in  connection 
with  others,  inaugurated  a  private  bank,  known  as 
the  Farmers'  Bank,  of  which  he  was  President.  Sub- 
sequently he  engaged  in  farming.  His  life  was  one 
of  honest  industry  and,  as  an  evidence  of  his  frugality, 
at  his  death,  which  occurred  November  30,  1882,  he 
left  quite  a  large  estate.  His  widow  survives  him. 
Our  subject  was  born  in  Connersville,  Ind.,  Novem- 
ber 9,  1838.  He  was  educated  in  the  schools  of  his 
native  village,  finishing  his  studies  in  one  of  the 
commercial  colleges  of  Cincinnati,  where  he  took  a 
complete  business  course.  Mr.  Mount  began  his 
business  career  as  book- keeper  in  the  business  house 
of  Mr.  Castle,  and  subsequently  filled  a  similar  posi- 
tion for  W.  J.  Hankins.  In  the  fall  of  1861  he 
enlisted  in  the  Second  Regiment  Indiana  Cavalry; 
the  following  fall  he  was  promoted  to  Second  Lieu- 
tenant in  the  Commissary  Department,  serving  in  all 
four  years;  then  resigned  on  account  of  failing  health.

and  John  H.  Mr.  Mount,  for  some  five  years,  was 
engaged  in  the  boot  and  shoe  business  with  John  F. 
Castle;  then  the  firm  became  Mount  Bros.,  which  con- 
tinued until  in  July,  1873,  when  our  subject  sold  out 
and  was  appointed  Cashier  of  the  First  National  Bank 
of  the  city.  Mr.  Mount  is  also  engaged  in  manufact- 
m'ing,  being  interested  in  the  Connersville  Furniture 
Manufacturing  Company;  has  also  carried  on  farming 
to  a  considerable  extent.  Both  he  and  his  wife  are 
members  of  the  Presbyterian  Church,  with  which  he 
has  been  connected  since  1859,  when  he  became  a 
Deacon  in  the  church.  He  is  now  one  of  the  Trustees 
and  church  Treasurer.

Crosson,  and  three  children  have  been  born  to  them: 
Clara,  Amanda,  and  Ruth  S.  After  marriage  Mr. 
Moyer  bought  Mr.  Felton  out  and  continued  with  Mr. 
Eoswell  three  years.  He  then  sold  out  and  started  a 
new  grocery  for  his  own  account,  operating  same  two 
years,  and  selling  out  and  going  to  Illinois.  In  1863 
he  opened  up  a  grocery,  bakery,  and  provision  store 
in  Connersville,  the  firm  being  Moyer  &amp;  Co.  In  a 
short  time  he  again  sold  out  and  made  brick  for  five 
years;  then  kept  a  lunch  stand  at  the  Junction  depot. 
In  1875  Mr.  Moyer  engaged  in  the  furnitare  business 
in  which  he  has  continued  up  to  present  time,  doing 
a  safe  and  prosperous  trade.  Our  subject  is  a  mem- 
ber of  the  I.  O.  O.  F.;  a  member  of  the  Methodist

JOSIAH  MTJLLIKIN  (deceased)  was  a  native  of 
Talbot  County,  Md. ,  born  in  the  village  of  Trappe, 
September  27,  1807,  and  in  that  village  and  in  the 
city  of  Baltimore  he  passed  his  childhood  and  early 
manhood,  learning  in  the  latter  place  the  shoe-mak- 
ing trade.  On  May  6,  1830,  he  was  united  in  mar- 
riage with  Miss  Ellen  Morrison,  and  the  year  follow- 
ing they  came  to  Fayette  County,  locating  on  a  farm 
in  Orange  Township,  where  they  resided  until  iu 
1841,  when  they  removed  to  the  house  in  Conners- 
ville where  he  died  November  14,  1884.  To  this 
union  were  born  seven  daughters  and  two  sons.  Mr. 
Mullikin  followed  his  trade  the  greater  portion  of 
life,  though  he  was  for  some  years  engaged  in  the 
manufacturing  business,  and  was  one  of  the  builders 
of  the  old  foundry  located  on  Eastern  Avenue,  near 
the  C,  H.  &amp;  I.  R.  R.  In  politics  he  was  a  Whig, 
and  afterward  a  Republican.  A  man  of  principle 
and  of  the  strongest  convictions,  the  position  he  took 
became  impregnable,  and  he  could  not  be  driven 
from  it.  He  served  Connersville  when  a  village  and 
afterward  when  a  city  in  various  offices,  among 
them:  Assessor,  member  of  School  Board,  Street 
Commissioner,  member  of  the  Board  of  Trustees 
(town).  Chief  of  Fire  Department,  and  member  of 
City  Council.  Mr.  Mullikin  was  intimately  identified 
with  much  of  the  growth  and  improvement  of  Con- 
nersville. In  many  ways  he  was  a  marked  man 
among  his  fellow  citizens.  He  was  honest  and  hon- 
orable in  his  dealings  with  men.  The  estimate 
placed  upon  him  by  the  people  with  whom  he  lived 
so  long  may  be  understood  by  the  fact  that  they 
intrusted  him  with  public  interest  by  electing  him  to 
various  offices  for  a  long  series  of  years.  Perhaps 
no  man  in  Fayette  County  was  better  known  than 
Josiah  Mullikin.  He  was  extensively  acquainted  and 
was  always  faithful  and  true  to  his  friends,  while  he 
was  never  afraid  of  any  who  may  have  been  opposed 
to  him. 

JOHN  MURPHY,    dealer  in   family  and  staple

death,  which  occurred  January  1,  1868.  Our  subject 
received  a  fair  education,  and  from  1872  to  1882 
was  a  finisher  in  the  furniture  factories.  During  a 
portion  of  the  time  he  had  charge  of  the  department.

He  is  a  wide-awake,  thorough  and  practical  grocer, 
destined  to  make  a  success  of  his  undertakinar.  He

By  close  application  to  business,  hard  study  and  strict 
integrity,  he  has  won  his  present  enviable  position  in 
the  city  of  Connersville.  In  1879  and  1880  he  was

a  just  reward  for  true  merit.  He  was  married  Octo- 
ber 22,  1879,  to  Miss  Olive  Hurst,  a  native  of  Wayne 
County,  Ind.  By  this  union  one  child,  Marcia,  was

death.  On  that  fatal  evening  Claude  was  giving  vent 
to  his  patriotic  heart, together  with  a  large  number  of 
others,  and  when  firing  a  small  cannon,  it  burst,  a  por- 
tion of  it  striking  his  leg,  tearing  away  the  knee  cap, 
and  badly  fracturing  the  limb,  from  the  effects  of 
which  he  died.  Claude  was  a  model  young  lad,  just 
emerging  into  manhood  and  surrounded  by  all  the 
comforts  of  life  that  are  calculated  to  make  one  hap- 
py. He  was  beloved  by  all  who  knew  him,  and  left 
a  large  circle  of  relatives  and  friends  to  mourn  his 
untimely  taking  away.  Claude  was  a  bright  and 
affectionate  boy,  whose  ways  had  won  for  him  a  warm 
place  in  the  hearts  of  many  outside  of  the  home  where 
he  was  loved  by  kind  parents,  brothers  and  sisters. 
He  was  a  son  of  Oliver  S.  and  Sarah  E.  (Edwards) 
Piper,  the  former  of  whom  was  born  in  Warren 
County,  Ohio,  January  11,  1837;  the  latter,  a  native 
of  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  was  born  April  12,  1839. 
They  were  married  February  26,  1857,  and  have  been 
blessed  with  six  children:  Charlie,  born  January  13, 
1858;  Lola  Delle,  born  August  16,  1865;  Oliver 
Claude;  Hettie  J.,  born  May  7,  1870;  Lewis  W.,born 
April  26,  1873;  James  C,  born  December  10,  1877. 
O.  S.  Piper  is  selling  fruit  trees  for  the  W.  &amp;  J.  Ash- 
worth  Nursery.  The  subject  of  this  sketch  received  a 
good  common  school  education,  and  began  clerking 
for  John  L.  Bailey,  in  November,  1882.  He  im- 
proved his  leisure  moments  by  running  a  neat  little 
job  office,  printing  cards,  etc.,  for  the  elite  of  the 
city,  and  he  turned  out  some  excellent  work.

and  New  York  State,  respectively.  His  parents 
resided,  most  of  their  lives,  in  Albany  County,  where

ing  until  his  death  in  1842.  Mr.  Pratt  remained 
with  his  mother  after  the  death  of  his  father  till 
nineteen  years  of  age.  He  then  engaged  in  mer- 
cantile trade  about  three  years  in  Albany,  after  which 
he  purchased  a  farm  and  devoted  some  ten  years  to 
agricultural  pursuits.  In  1862  he  came  West  and 
located  in  Connersville,  where  he  has  since  resided. 
He  at  once  established  himself  in  the  dry  goods  trade 
and  later  added  boots  and  shoes,  which  he  now  hand- 
les exclusively,  doing  considerable  manufacturing. 
He  was  married  September  28,  1854,  to  Helen  M. 
Ferguson,  of  Duanesburg.  Schenectady  Co.,  N.  Y. ,  a 
daughter  of  John  Ferguson,  and  five  children  were 
born  to  them:  Jennie  C.  (now  Mrs.  Dr.  Morrison), 
Maggie  L.  (now  Mrs.  E.  V.  Hawkins),  David  L., 
who  died  in  1864,  Mary  H.  and  Elsie  M.  Mr.  Pratt 
is  a  member  of  the  Masonic  fraternity;  the  family 
are  all  associated  with  the  Presbyterian  Church.     He 


does  a  fine  business,  and  ranks  among  the  first  of  the 
mercantile  factors  of  Connersville. 

CAPT.  ALFRED  J.  RALPH,  ex-manager  of  the 
Western  Hosiery  Mills,  Connersville,  is  one  of  the 
prosperous  and  enterprising  manufacturers  of  this 
city.  He  was  born  near  Hillsdale,  Mich.,  May  22, 
1840.  His  early  training  was  on  a  farm  and  he 
had  the  benefit  of  a  good  common  school  education. 
His  father,  Stillman  Ralph,  who  was  born  in  Ver- 
mont, moved  to  Michigan  while  young.  He  was  the 
first  physician  in  this  county,  being  one  of  the  earli- 
est settlers.  Our  subject's  mother,  Betsey  (Netha- 
way)  Ralph,  was  born  and  raised  in  the  State  of  New 
York.  Capt.  Ralph  farmed  up  to  1861.  Being 
a  loyal,  law-abiding  citizen,  upon  the  call  of  the  Pres- 
ident for  troops  to  defend  the  flag  of  our  Union,  he 
recruited  Company  I,  Sixth  Michigan  Volunteer  In- 
fantry, of  which  he  was  elected  First  Lieutenant,  and 
left  at  once  for  the  Department  of  the  Gulf,  serving 
under  Gen.  Ben.  Butler.  In  1863  he  was  promoted 
to  Captain  for  gallant  services,  after  which  he  was 
taken  prisoner  and  confined  in  Libby  prison  for  six 
months.  Being  exchanged,  he  returned  to  his  com- 
mand and  served  until  the  close  of  the  war.  He  then 
engaged  as  commercial  traveler  for  an  Indianapolis 
notion  house,  continuing  up  to  1882,  when  he  was 
engaged  as  manager  of  fhe  Western  Hosiery  Mills. 
April  21,  1864,  our  subject  married  Miss  Ridie 
Roache,  a  native  of  Maryland,  born  December  7,  1842, 
and  by  this  union  was  born  one  daughter — loda  B. 
Capt.  Ralph  is  a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F. 

PROF.  JASON  L.  RIPPETOE,  Superintendent 
of  Public  Schools,  Connersville,  was  born  in  Vigo 
County,  Ind.,  December  6,  1839;  son  of  Pleasant  B. 
and  Catharine  V.  (Shuey)  Rippetoe,  natives  of  Vir- 
ginia, the  former  born  February  8,  1811,  and  the  lat- 
ter December  13,  1818.  They  now  reside  in  Effing- 
ham, 111.  The  early  life  of  our  subject  was  spent 
upon  a  farm  and  at  the  age  of  eighteen  he  entered 
Asbury  University,  taking  a  collegiate  course,  and 
graduating  in  1863.  After  this  he  taught  for  three 
years  in  Danville  Academy,  two  years  as  Principal. 
In  1867  he  came  to  Connersville  and  took  charge  of 
the  Union  Schools  as  Superintendent,  which  position 
he  has  filled  ever  since,  excepting  in  1881  and  1882, 
when  he  acted  as  County  Superintendent.  Prof. 
Rippetoe  was  married  September  26,  1865,  to  Miss 
Sarah  E.  Allen,  who  was  born  in  Greencastle,  Ind., 
September  26,  1844,  and  by  this  union  three  chil- 
dren were  born:  Kate  A.,  Emma  J.  and  Bessie  L. 
The  Professor  enlisted  in  the  Eighteenth  Indiana 
Battery,  under  Capt.  Beck,  Gen.  Wilson's  Corps, 
serving  two  years.  He  is  a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F. 
and  G.  A.  R.  Both  he  and  his  wife  are  consistent 
members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  in   the

Sabbath-school  of  which  he  is  a  particularly  active 
and  enthusiastic  worker  (at  present  the  Superintend- 
ent), and  in  the  other  branches  of  church  work.  As 
an  educator  Prof.  Rippetoe  has  been  successful,  and 
as  an  evidence  of  his  popularity  we  have  but  to  refer 
to  his  long  term  of  service  in  the  schools  of  Conners- 
ville,  which  are  in  a  prosperous  condition  under  his 
efficient  and  judicious  management.  The  affable  and 
genial  manners  of  our  subject,  especially  in  kindness 
of  heart  shown  to  strangers  in  the  city,  one  of  whom 
will  not  soon  forget  him,  have  endeared  him  to  a  large 
circle  of  friends. 

THOMAS  J.  KITTENHOUSE,  Treasurer  and 
Secretary  of  the  Cooley-Morrison  Manufacturing 
Association,  Connersville,  was  born  in  Harrison,  Ohio, 
August  31,  1846,  son  of  Jefferson  and  Mary  (Moore) 
Rittenhouse,  old  residents  of  Hamilton  County,  Ohio; 
his  father  having  been  one  of  the  first  merchants  of 
Harrison,  and  one  of  the  most  prominent.  Mr.  Rit- 
tenhouse grew  to  maturity  in  his  native  county.  In 
1868  he  came  to  Connersville  and  opened  a  grocery  and 
provision  store,  taking  stock  soon  after  in  the  Cooley- 
Morrison  Furniture  Manufacturing  Association,  to 
which,  since  1880,  he  has  devoted  his  entire  atten- 
tion, having  abandoned  the  grocery  trade  at  that  date. 
He  is  at  present  Secretary  and  Treasurer  of  the  Asso- 
ciation, and  has  materially  aided  it  in  its  ascent  to 
the  commanding  position  which  it  now  occupies 
among  other  institutions  of  its  kind.  Mr.  Ritten- 
house has  also  been  identified  with  most  of  the  other 
enterprises  which  have  been  inaugurated  in  the  town 
of  Connersville  since  his  residence  in  the  place,  and 
is  regarded  as  one  of  its  most  energetic  and  efficient 
business  men  at  the  present  time.  He  was  married 
December  5,  1872,  to  Miss  Jennie  Garside,  of  Harri- 
son, Ohio;  a  daughter  of  Joseph  and  Martha  Garside, 
an  old  and  esteemed  family  of  that  place.  Septem- 
ber 27,  1881,  his  wife  passed  away.  Mr.  Ritten- 
house is  a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F.  Grand  Lodge  and 
Encampment,  in  which  he  has  passed  all  the  official 
chairs.  He  is  a  man  of  shrewd  business  qualifica- 
tions, and  his  past  success  is  a  worthy  guarantee  for 
his  future  prosperity. 

AUSTIN  READY,  of  the  firm  of  Downs,  Ready 
&amp;  Co.,  Connersville,  is  a  native  of  Ireland,  and  son 
of  John  and  Mary  (O'Mally)  Ready.  He  was  born 
August  24,  1850,  and  in  1852  was  brought  by  his 
parents  to  this  country.  The  family  located  in 
Medina,  N.  Y.,  resided  there  about  three  years  and 
then  came  to  Franklin  County,  Ind. ,  where  the 
mother  died  in  1862.  Soon  after  this  the  remainder  of 
the  family  removed  to  Glenwood,  Rush  County,  and  in 
1868  came  from  that  place  to  Connersville,  where 
they  have  since  resided.  Our  subject  spent  his  early 
years  on  the  farm.      He  clerked  in  Groflf's   grocery 


store  and  restaurant  about  four  years,  was  employed 
about  eighteen  months  in  the  Stock-yard  Hotel  at 
Cincinnati,  was  engaged  in  the  liquor  business  at 
Connersville  about  two  years,  piu'chased  stock  in  the 
Cooley-Morrison  Manufacturing  Association,  and 
became  its  President  two  years,  and  then  purchased 
an  interest  in  the  establishment,  in  which  he  is 
still  a  partner.  His  first  partnership  in  the  planing- 
mill  business  was  with  F.  W.  Martin,  whose  interest 
was  purchased  by  Downs  &amp;  Wait  in  the  winter  of 
1882.  The  company  does  a  large  business  in  the 
manufacture  of  doors,  sash,  blinds,  moldings,  etc. 
In  1867  Mr.  Ready  was  married  to  Mary  Welch,  a 
native  of  Connersville,  Ind. 

FRANCIS  M.  ROOTS,  manufacturer,  and  Presi- 
dent of  First  National  Bank,  Connersville,  was  born 
in  Oxford,  Ohio,  October  28,  1824.  In  1816  his  par- 
ents removed  from  the  State  of  Vermont  to  that  place, 
where  the  father,  Alanson  Roots,  established  a  woolen 
manufactory,  in  which  he  was  assisted  by  three  of  his 
elder  sons,  our  subject  giving  his  time  in  the  summers 
and  attending  school  in  the  winters.  At  the  age  of 
sixteen  years  he  entered  Miami  University,  located  in 
the  village,  and  pursued  a  scientific  course.  Mr. 
Roots'  ancestors  were  descended  from  the  old  Puritan 
stock  who  fled  to  the  shores  of  New  England  that 
they  might  have  the  privilege  of  worshiping  God 
according  to  the  dictates  of  their  own  consciences. 
In  1845  Francis  M.  and  his  brother.  Philander  H., 
began  making  arrangements  to  move  their  woolen 
mill  to  Connersville,  Ind.,  being  attracted  by  its  fine 
water  power  and  other  business  facilities,  where  they 
erected  a  building  100x40  feet,  five  stories  high,  with 
a  capacity,  during  the  war,  of  employing  100  hands 
on  army  supplies.  This  building  was  consumed  by 
fire  in  1875.  In  1860  their  greatest  invention  was 
patented,  which  is  known  all  over  the  world  as  Roots' 
Rotary  Blower,  since  which  time  they  have  made 
and  sold  in  this  country  over  10,000  machines,  and 
as  many  more  in  Europe — over  5,000  in  England 
alone.  They  have  been  awarded  first  premiums  at 
three  international  expositions — in  1867  at  Paris; 
in  1873  at  Vienna;  and  at  the  Centennial  Exposi- 
tion of  our  own  country  at  Philadelphia  in  1876. 
In  the  prosecution  of  his  business  Mr.  Roots  made 
four  trips  to  Europe,  and  expects  to  make  another 
tour  this  season,  taking  his  family  along.  Our  sub- 
ject was  married  October  8,  1850,  to  Miss  Esther  E. 
Pumphrey,  born  in  Connersville  February  29,  1830. 
By  this  marriage  six  children  were  born,  thi-ee  now 
living.  At  home  Mr.  Roots  has  endeavored  to  be  in 
sympathy  with  the  best  interests  of  the  community, 
and  has  cheerfully  borne  his  pai't  in  all  public  enter- 
prises. He  has  been  an  active  member  of  the  Pres- 
byterian  Church    from    early   youth,  and  an  earnest

tives, and  also  President  of  the  Connersville  Hydrau- 
lic Company,  extending  from  Cambridge  City  to  Con- 
nersville, and  is  one  of  the  principal  owners  and 
manager  of  the  blower  manufactory;  is  also  engaged 
in  various  other  enterprises. 

FRANCIS  T.  ROOTS,  banker,  Connersville,  is 
one  of  the  active,  enterprising  young  men  of  the  city. 
He  was  born  in  Connersville  July  17,'  1857.  He 
attended  the  city  schools  and  completed  his  education 
at  Chickering  Institute,  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  where  he 
was  the  recipient  of  two  gold  medals  for  proficiency, 
one  in  the  mathematical  branch,  and  the  other  in  sci- 
ence and  valedictory  effort,  which  he  prizes  as  sacred, 
above  all  other  boyhood  possessions.  P.  H.  Roots, 
our  subject's  father,  was  born  in  Rutland  County, 
Vt.,  November  17,  1813,  and  in  1818  his  parents 
moved  to  Oxford,  Ohio,  where  he  received  a  collegiate 
education  in  Miami  University.  October  27,  1837, 
he  married  Miss  Susan  C.  Brown,  of  Cincinnati, 
Ohio,  and  came  to  Connersville  in  1849.  He  formed 
a  partnership  with  his  brother,  F.  M.  Roots,  in  1851, 
which  was  severed  by  death.  In  1834  he  united  with 
the  Presbyterian  Church,  soon  after  which  he  was 
chosen  Ruling  Elder.  He  was  a  leading  active  mem- 
ber of  the  church  and  Sabbath-school  up  to  his  death. 
In  1873  he  was  elected  President  of  the  First 
National  Bank,  which  position  he  held  up  to  his 
death,  which  occurred  May  22,  1879.  Our  subject 
read  law  under  Snow  &amp;  Kumler,  and  attended  law 
school  at  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  thereby  completing  his 
preparatory  course  for  business,  after  which  he 
engaged  in  the  wholesale  boot  and  shoe  trade,  with 
Crane  &amp;  Lupton,  in  Cincinnati,  for  two  years;  then, 
at  the  death  of  his  father,  he  was  called  home  and 
was  elected  Vice-President  of  the  First  National 
Bank,  which  position  he  has  filled  ever  since.  Novem- 
ber 16,  1880,  he  was  united  in  marriage  with  Miss 
Sallie  M.  Hileman,  daughter  of  Hon.  William  Hile- 
man,  of  Evansville,  Ind.  By  this  union  one  child 
was  born  —Clarence  S.  Mr.  Roots  is  Treasurer  of 
Connersville  Furniture  Manufacturing  Company,  also 
Treasurer  of  Connersville  Hydraulic  Company.  He 
and  his  estimable  wife  are  members  of  the  Presby- 
terian Church,  of  which  he  was  elected  Trustee  in 
1884.  Mr.  Roots  is  also  an  inventor,  and,  with  his 
many  valuable  patents  secured  and  in  progress,  his 
future  is  bright  and  enviable. 

MAJ.  JOHN  W.  ROSS,  Postmaster,  Conners- 
ville, was  born  in  Franklin  County,  Ind.,  September 
30,  1837,  received  the  best  common  school  edu- 
cation the  surroundings  aflfbrded,  and  was  raised  on 


a  farm.  His  parents,  John  S.  and  Hannah  (Masters) 
Ross,  were  natives  of  Pennsylvania,  former  born  Sep- 
tember 13,  1805.  They  were  married  in  1827,  and 
came  to  Indiana  in  1834,  locating  in  Franklin  County; 
then  moved  to  Fayette  County  in  1853.  Mr.  Ross, 
July  29,  1861,  enlisted  in  Third  Indiana  Battery, 
under  Capt.  W.  W.  Frybarger.  October,  1862,  he 
was  promoted  to  Lieutenant,  and  February,  1863, 
at  Knoxville,  Tenn. ,  he  was  appointed  Assistant  Chief 
of  Artillery,  and  Chief  of  Ordnance  Department  of 
Ohio,  with  rank  and  pay  of  Major.  He  served  his 
country,  in  all,  over  three  and  a  half  years.  After 
his  return  home  he  was  married,  December  18,  1865, 
to  Miss  Sarah  M.  Hanson,  born  October  10, 1837.  By 
this  union  one  child  has  been  born — Mary  A.  March 
28, 1866,  Mr.  Ross  engaged  in  the  grocery  business  with 
M.  C.  Buckley,  continuing  up  to  February  1,  1868,

rest,  our  subject  formed,  in  1869,  a  partnership  with 
Mr.  Leonard  in  same  business,  and  this  firm  existed 
up  to  1871,  when  he  purchased  Mr.  Leonard's  inter- 
est, conducting  the  business  alone  up  to"1873.  He 
then  sold  a  half-interest  to  Mr.  Morrison,  a  clerk 
whom  the  Major  had  educated  to  the  business.  The 
"firm  of  Ross  &amp;  Morrison  existed  up  to  September  12, 
1882,  when  our  subject  sold  out  and  accepted  the 
appointment  of  Postmaster  February  1,  1883.  '  Maj. 
Ross  was  also  Assessor  of  Internal  Revenue  from 
December  23,  1871,  to  February,  1873,  and  Rev- 
enue Collector  from  March  10,  1874,  to  February, 
1876.  Our  subject  prospered  in  all  his  undertakings. 
He  has  tilled  all  the  positions  of  trust  with  credit  to 
himself  and  to  the  entire  satisfaction  of  the  people. 
He  is  a  member  of  I.  O.  O.  F.  and  Encampment, 
also  Q.  A.  R. 

JOHN  B.  SALYER,  Connersville,  is  the  honored 
Superintendent  of  Fayette  County  Infirmary.  He 
is  known  as  one  of  the  most  placid-tempered  men  of 
the  county,  and  is  therefore  made  the  subject  of  many 
practical  jokes,  which  he  is  ever  able  to  reciprocate 
with  a  completeness  and  facility  peculiar  only  to 
himself.  His  even  temper  is  perhaps  hereditary 
rather  than  acquired,  as  his  father  and  uncle  (to  him 
ever  equal  masters  during  his  minority)  dwelt  together 
and  reared  families  in  the  same  house,  holding  their 
property  in  common,  with  twenty  children  as  the 
result  of  their  respective  unions.  His  parents  were 
Charles  and  Margaret  (Waters)  Salyer,  natives  of 
Carolina  and  Virginia  respectively,  and  of  English 
and  Irish  descent.  They  came  to  this  county  in  an 
early  day,  and  purchased  a  large  tract  of  land,  which 
the  two  brothers  cultivated  in  common,  at  their 
father's  request,  as  related  above.  John  B.,  whose 
name  heads  this  sketch,  was  born  February  14,  1827. 
He  spent  his  early  years  in  the  common  family  of  his

father  and  uncle,  employed  in  the  arduous  labors  of 
the  farm.  At  the  age  of  twenty-two  he  was  married 
to  Adeline  O.sbon,  also  a  native  of  this  county,  and 
by  this  wife  ten  children  are  now  living:  Andrew  J., 
Richard,  Lewis,  Ham,  Theo,  Bode,  May  A.,  Belzura, 
Flora  and  Maria.  For  several  years  after  his  mar- 
riage Mr.  Salyer  resided  on  the  home  farm.  He  then 
purchased  140  acres  in  Jackson  Township,  where  he 
also  lived  a  number  of  years.  He  at  length  disposed 
of  his  farm,  however,  and  embarked  in  the  grocery 
trade,  at  Everton,  conducting  this  business  three 
years,  holding  the  office  of  Postmaster  at  the  same 
time.  After  a  few  years  spent  in  the  milling  and 
lumber  business,  Mr.  Salyer  returned  to  the  farm, 
where  he  was  engaged  till  1879,  in  which  year  he 
was  appointed  to  his  present  position  of  Infirmary 
Superintendent,  an  office  which  he  has  since  retained, 
and  the  duties  of  which  he  has  most  faithfully  and 
efficiently  discharged. 

CHARLES  B.  SANDERS,  City  Treasurer,  Con- 
nersville,  Notary  Public,  insurance  and  real  estate 
agent,  and  possessor  of  the  only  abstract  of  titles  in 
the  county,  is  a  native  of  New  York,  born  August  26, 
1827.  He  received  a  common  school  education,  and 
at  the  age  of  eleven  years  was  taken  with  necrosis  of 
the  left  tibia,  which  confined  him  to  his  bed  for  three 
years.  In  1869  he  had  his  leg  amputated  three  inches 
below  the  knee,  which  gave  relief.  His  father,  Eli- 
phalet  Sanders,  was  born  in  Connecticut,  February 
22, 1790;  died  May  19, 1853.  His  mother  was  born  in 
New  York,  September  17,  1794;  died  April  18,  1881. 
In  early  life  Charles  B.,  as  far  as  health  would  per- 
mit, followed  the  woolen-mill  business.  In  1864  he 
began  machinists'  work  for  a  livelihood,  at  which  he 
continued  up  to  1872,  when  he  was  elected  County 
Recorder,  and  his  work  being  regular  he  was  reelac- 
ted  in  1876.  Mr.  Sanders  was  married  April  10, 1853, 
to  Miss  Ann  P.  Caswell,  a  native  ot  Ohio,  who  was  born  • 
May  12,  1833,  and  by  this  union  there  is  one  child — ■ 
Clinton  A. — now  a  resident  of  Richmond,  and  a  ma- 
chinist with  the  Hoosier  Drill  Company.  Our  subject 
came  to  this  county  March  27,  1857.  He  is  a  mem- 
ber of  I.  O.  O.  F.,  Subordinate  and  Encampment;  a 
member  of  the  Presbyterian  Church. 

JOHN  SAVAGE,  Connersville,  was  born  in  Ban- 
gor, Me.,  December  7,1815;8on  of  John  and  Margaret 
(Campbell)  Savage,  natives  of  that  vicinity.  The 
family,  in  company  with  Daniel  Campbell,  Jacob 
Nelson  (related)  and  Henry  Welch,  in  1815  left 
Maine  for  the  West,  first  locating  at  Columbia,  near 
Cincinnati,  where  John  Savage,  Sr.,  died  in  the  fall 
of  that  year.  In  1817  the  widow  and  family,  with  the 
families  of  the  others  mentioned,  removed  to  what  is 
now  Fayette  County.  In  1822  the  Widow  Savage  was 
married  to  John  Adams,  a  farmer  of  Harrison  Town- 


ship, and  their  home  was  also  the  home  of  our  sub- 
ject until  he  reached  the  age  of  twenty-three  years. 
In  March,  1839,  Mr.  Savage  was  united  in  marriage 
with  Melissa  Thomas,  a  native  of  the  State  of  New 
York,  and  a  daughter  of  Jacob  Thomas,  who  settled  in

THOMAS  WHITE  (deceased)  one  of  the  early 
settlers  of  this  county,  was  born  in  Tennessee  in  the 
year  1803.  In  1813  his  father  with  the  rest  of  the 
family  crossed  the  Ohio  River  from  Tennessee,  but 
trouble  with  the  Indians  made  it  necessary  for  them 
to  return  to  the  fortifications  at  Hamilton.  In  1815, 
however,  they  located  in  this  county  and  for  some 
time  were  much  annoyed  by  the  Indians,  who  were 
then  savage  and  troublesome.  They  purchased  160 
acres  of  land  in  the  east  part  of  this  township,  Mr. 
White  making  some  of  the  payments  by  cutting  cord 
wood  in  the  vicinity  of  Cincinnati.  They  resided 
here  until  about  1838,  when  they  moved  to  Madison 
County,  Ind.,  where  the  father  died  a  few  years  later, 
the  mother  about  1852  or  1853.  Thomas  White

and  was  a  lineal  descendant  of  the  old  Douglass  fam- 
ily so  famous  in  history  and  romance.  The  Cassadys 
were  of  Irish  descent  and  of  an  old  and  prominent  fam-

tion of  the  old  homestead  in  this  county,  and  pixr- 
chased  the  remainder.  He  followed  farming  till  1861, 
when  he  retired  from  active  service  and  moved  to 
Connersville,  where  he  died  in  1863.  He  was  a  man 
of  tirm  convictions,  scrupulous  honesty,  and  greatly 
reverenced  by  his  family.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  White 
reared  no  children  of  their  own,  but  adopted  a  sister's 
son,  John  T.  White,  who  has  always  lived  with  the 
family.  John  T.  was  born  in  1843  and  in  1876  married 
Anna  R.  Halbert,  a  native  of  Maryland,  and  daugh- 
ter of  Samuel  Halbert.  By  this  marriage  three  chil-

a  son  of  John  Bilby,  a  native  of  England,  and  vyhose 
father,  a  very  v?ealthy  man,  was  an  officer  of  the 
King's  Bench.  John  Bilby,  when  a  young  man,  was 
invited  to  participate  in  a  ball  given  on  the  occasion 
of  the  christening  of  a  new  ship.  A  large  crowd  of 
wealthy  young  people  were  present  (he  was  the  only 
member  of  his  father's  family)  and,  all  intent  on  hav- 
ing a  good  time,  did  not  notice  that  the  vessel  had  set 
sail,  until,  in  the  morning,  they  found  themselves  out 
of  sight  of  land.  They  were  relieved  of  their  fine 
clothes,  jewelry  and  other  valuables  and  brought  to 
the  United  States,  then  involved  in  its  war  with  Great 
Britain.  John  Bilby  participated  in  the  Revolution- 
ary war;  subsequently  settled  in  Pennsylvania,  where 
he  remained  until  his  death.  He  was  twice  married

1829, when  he  moved  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  and  here 
died  January  16,  1873.  His  widow  survived  him  un- 
til February  24,  1884.  Our  subject  was  educated  at 
Fairview  Academy,  Rush  County,  Ind.,  and  taught 
school  for  several  years.  He  was  married,  December 
10,  1854,  to  Dorcas  A.  Atlierton,  born  in  Hamilton 
County,  Ohio,  February  17,  1832,  daughter  of  Stout

dren: Charles  M.,  Emerson  A.,  Florence  J.,  Clara 
O.,  Elmore  W.,  Mariannia,  Alva  E.,  Morten  L.,  Palm- 
er T.  and  Sherman.  After  marriage  they  settled  in 
Harrison  Township,  but  in  a  year  moved  to  Posey 
Township,  remaining  there  until  1866,  when  he  pur- 
chased the  farm  in  this  township  on  which  he  has 
since  resided.      He  owns  over  600  acres  of  land. 

EMERSON  A.  BILBY,  farmer,  Columbia  Town- 
ship, son  of  Francis  M.  and  Dorcas  A.  Bilby,  was 
born  in  this  county,  November  13,  1856.  He  was

GEORGE     W.     BOOE,      farmer,     Connersville 


Township,  was  born  June  4,  1814,  ou  the  well 
cultivated  farm  where  he  has  ever  since  resided. 
His  parents,  Benjamin  and  Sarah  (Harwood) 
Booe,  were  natives  of  one  of  the  Carolinas,  and 
soon  after  their  marriage  removed  to  Green 
County,  Ky.,  where  they  resided  some  five  years,  then 
settled  in  Boone  County,  Ky.,  where  Mr.  Booe 
entered  the  United  States  service  in  the  war  of  1812. 
In  December,  1813,  he  located  on  the  farm  where 
George  W.  now  resides,  and  here  the  parents  passed 
the  remainder  of  their  lives,  the  father  dying  in 
1839,  and  the  mother  in  1844.  Our  subject, 
strictly  speaking,  is  one  of  the  pioneers  of  this 
section,  and  has  passed  through  the  many  privations 
usually  undergone  in  the  clearing  up  of  a  new  coun- 
try. It  is  claimed  for  him  that  he  was  the  first  white 
child  born  in  the  county  west  of  the  West  Fork  of 
Whitewater  River.  He  is  familiar  with  the  Indian 
scenes  of  his  early  life,  having  frequently  come  in  con- 
tact with  the  various  bands  then  roaming  through  this 
country,  well  knowing  the  Chief  Ben  Davis,  elsewhere 
referred  to  iu  this  work.  In  October,  1836,  Mr. 
Booe  was  united  in  man-iage  with  Elizabeth  Moffett, 
a  native  of  Tennessee,  daughter  of  Samuel  and  Mary 
(Doddleson)  Moffett,  natives  of  Ireland,  and  to  them 
have  been  born  eight  childi-en. 

ROBERT  C.  BRATTEN,  Superintendent  of  Cem- 
etery, Connersville  Township,  was  born  in  Staunton, 
Va.,  September  28,  1810,  son  of  Peter  and  Frances 
(Patterson)  Bratten,  natives  of  Pennsylvia  and  Vir- 
ginia respectively.  When  our  subject  was  qaite 
young  his  parents  moved  to  Boone  County,  Ky., 
where  Robert  C.  grew  up  and  learned  the  brick  and 
stone  mason  trade,  which  he  followed  until  1866.  In 
1831  he  removed  to  Grant  County,  Ky.,  and  in  1835 
to  the  State  of  Indiana,  locating  at  Lawrenceburg, 
where  he  remained  until  1841,  when  he  removed  to  Con- 
nersville, and  here,  since  1866,  he  has  been  occupied 
as  the  Superintendent  of  the  City  Cemetery,  a  position 
he  has  filled  so  long  very  acceptably  to  the  citizens 
of  the  city  and  vicinity.  On  the  6th  of  March,  1832, 
Mr.  Bratten  was  married  to  Harriet  Woody ard,  which 
union  has  been  blessed  with  ten  children,  all  of 
whom  except  one  are  deceased.  In  politics  Mr.  Brat- 
ten is  a  Republican.  His  first  Presidential  vote  was 
cast  for  Jackson.  He  voted  the  Democratic  ticket 
until  the  birth  of  the  Republican  party,  with  which 
he  has  since  affiliated.  Both  himself  and  wife  have 
been  for  forty  years  or  more  members  of  the  Metho- 
dist Episcopal  Church.  They  are  respected  and 
esteemed  citizens.

November  13,  1879,  his  wife  having  preceded  him 
August  19,  1879.  Both  were  members  of  the  Luther- 
an Church.  Samuel  Brown,  one  of  the  two  repre- 
sentatives of  their  father's  family  in  this  county 
(the  other  being  his  brother  Daniel,  in  East  Conners- 
ville),  was  born  in  Lebanon  County,  Penn.,  January 
21,  1822.  His  education  was  received  principally  in 
the  subscription  schools  of  Indiana.  Being  a  poor 
boy,  these  advantages  were  very  much  curtailed  by 
his  having  to  work  for  a  living.  He  started  out  in 
life  working  in  the  harvest  lield  at  $6.00  per  month 
and  thus  got  a  start.  His  lirst  marriage,  in  1841, 
was  with  Elizabeth,  daughter  of  Garland  Stanley,  by 
whom  he  had  two  children,  Albert  S.  and  Preston, 
and  Mrs.  Brown  dying  in  1848,  at  the  age  of  thirty- 
one  years,  he  married  in  1849,  for  his  second  wife 
Sarah  Stanley,  sister  of  his  first  wife.  By  this  union 
were  born  two  children :  Nathan  and  Joseph.  This 
Mrs.  Brown  died  in  1867,  aged  sixty- four  years.  In 
1869  Mr.  Brown  then  married  for  his  third  wife 
Sarah  Ellen,  daughter  of  Nathan  Stanley,  who  has 
borne  him  one  child  —Charley.  Samuel  Brown  has 
prospered  in  life,  and  now  owns  174  acres  of  excel- 
lent land,  after  settling  his  children  in  good  homes. 
He  is  a  self-made  man  in  the  strongest  sense  of  the 
word,  and  is  a  respected  and  progressive  citizen.  He 
has  held  the  ofiEce  of  Township  Trustee  seven  years, 
and  in  the  transaction  of  public  business  has  shown 
good  executive  ability.

until  1862,  when  he  moved  to  a  farm  on  Section  5, 
which  he  had  purchased  previously,  and  there 
remained  until  his  death,  which  occurred  April  24, 
1883.  His  widow  still  lives  on  the  farm.  Their 
children  are  Charles  H.,  Thomas  M.,  George  W., 
Sarah  J.  and  Mary  E.  Our  subject  was  married  in 
this  county,  August  29,  1861,  to  Margaret  E.,  daugh-

JOHN  BUCHANAN  (deceased)  was  born  in 
Washington  County,  Va.,  July  25,  1784.  His 
parents,  Joseph  and  Ann  (Wilson)  Buchanan,  were 
natives  of  Ireland  and  Pennsylvania  respectively. 
Mr.  Buchanan  was  engaged  in  farming  in  his  native 
county  till  about  twenty-five  years  of  age.  In  1818 
he  moved  to  Indiana  and  located  in  this  county,  where 
in  1820  he  was  married  to  Maria  Smith,  also  a  native 
of  Washington  County,  Va.,  born  in  1804  and  a

were  born  in  the  same  county;  came  in  1812  to  this 
county,  where  the  mother  died  in  1818,  the  father  in 
1836.  About  1821  Mr.  Buchanan  purchased  fifty 
acres  of  land,  where  his  widow  still  resides,  and  to 
this  he  added  till  he  owned  140  acres.  Here  he  closed 
his  life  about  1867.  He  was  always  of  a  quiet  dis- 
position, and  was  held  in  high  esteem  by  all  who 
knew  him.  Mrs.  Buchanan  is  still  living  and  is  well 
preserved  for  one  of  her  years.  They  were  among  the 
first  settlers  of  the  county  and  endured  many  hard- 
ships through  their  long  lives  of  earnest  toil.  Mrs. 
Buchanan  has  given  the  charge  of  her  farm  to  her 
nephew,  Tobias  Smith,  who  was  born  in  Marion 
County,  Ind.,  in  1855.  His  parents,  Robert  and 
Nancy  (Sweeney)  Smith,  were  natives  of  Virginia  and 
Kentucky,  respectively,  and  came  to  this  State  in 
1811.  They  are  still  living  in  Marion  County.  Mr. 
Smith  resided  with  his  parents  till  he  was  twenty-one 
years  of  age,  and  then  began  operations  for  himself.

where  he  has  since  been  engaged.  He  was  married, 
in  1882,  to  Lizzie  Sesserman,  a  daughter  of  Adam 
and  Nancy  (Bryant)  Sesserman,  and  they  have  one 
child — Edward — born  in  1883.     Mr.  Smith  is  an  in-

C.  H.  BUNDRANT,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship, one  of  the  early  settlers  and  old  residents  of 
this  township,  was  born  in  Virginia,  March  12,  1822, 
son  of  Thomas  and  Susan  (Lockett)  Bundrant,  also 
natives  of  Virginia,  and  who  came  to  this  county  in 
1830,  where  they  died  live  years  later,  former  in  May, 
latter  in  September,  1835.  Thomas  Bundrant  was  a 
soldier  in  the  war  of  1812,  and  marched  on  foot  from 
Harper's  Ferry,  Va.,  to  Natchez,  Miss.  The  paternal 
ancestors  of  our  subject  immigrated  to  this  country 
from  France  ])rior  to  the  Revolutionary  war.  At  the 
death  of  his  parents  Mr.  Bundrant  was  "  bound  out," 
as  was  the  custom  of  those  days,  to  William  Brown, 
a  tanner,  whose  widow  still  resides  in  Connersville. 
He  served  an  apprenticeship  of  six  years  at  this  trade, 
and  was  subsequently  Mr.  Brown's  partner  in  the 
business  five  years.  He  then  purchased  his  present 
farm  of  eighty-five  acres,  on  which  he  has  since  been 
engaged  in  the  quiet  pursuits  of  agriculture.  He

now  resides  in  Kansas;  Frances,  wife  of  Mr.  Williams, 
resides  at  Muncie,  Ind. ;  Adaline,  now  Mrs.  Jordan, 
resides  with  her  brother  C.  H.  Mr.  Bundrant  has 
always  lived  a  quiet  life,  and  is  highly  esteemed  in 
the  community.  In  temperance  work  he  has  ever 
been  a  warm  advocate;  in  politics  an  uncompromising

natives  of  Maryland,  who  removed  to  Hamilton 
County,  Ohio,  in  October  of  1809,  the  trip  being 
accomplished  by  team,  consuming  one  month's  time. 
Here  they  died  at  advanced  ages.  Our  subject  was 
six  years  old  then,  and  was  eai'ly  inured  to  the  hard- 
ships of  the  pioneer's  life,  with  little  or  no  advan- 
tages for  securing  an  education.  He  was  manned,  in 
Hamilton  County,  Ohio,  September  14,  1826,  to 
Nancy  Snyder,  born  in  Pennsylvania  March  6,  1809, 
a  daughter  of  John  and  Frances  (Barr)  Snyder, 
Pennsylvanians  of  German  descent.  In  1832  Mr. 
Burk  left  Hamilton  County,  Ohio,  and  settled  in 
Dearborn  County,  Ind., and  in  October,  1835, he  moved 
to  this  township,  having,  the  previous  March,  pur- 
chased 160  acres  of  land  for  which  he  paid  $15.55 


per  acre.  He  began  life  poor,  but  with  the  help  ren- 
dered him  by  his  estimable  wife,  with  whom  he  lived 
fifty  years,  he  overcame  every  obstacle  and  at  one 
time  owned  1,260  acres  of  land,  300  of  which  were  in 
this  county.  He  has  tilled  the  offices  of  Justice  of 
the  Peace  three  terms  and  Township  Trustee  two 
terms.  Mr.  Burk  has  belonged  to  the  Baptist  Church 
for  twenty  years;  his  wife  was  also  a  member  of  the 
same  denomination,  as  are  the  most  of  his  children, 
eleven  in  all,  ten  of  whom  are  now  living;  Mary  J., 
Andrew  J.  (deceased),  Sarah,  Nancy,  Rachel  A., 
Maria  F.,  Rebecca  E. ,  Emily  A.,  John  S. ,  Greene  and 
Stephen.  Mrs.  Burk  died  July  7,  1878.  Mr.  Burk 
has  been  a  life-long  Democrat  and  cast  his  first  vote 
for  "  Old  Hickory,"  Andrew  Jackson. 

DANIEL  BURRIS,  farmer,  Waterloo  Township, 
was  born  in  Fauquier  County,  Va.,  in  1817;  son  of 
Philip  and  Susan  Burris,  who  located  in  Washington 
Township,  Wayne  Co.,  Ind.,  in  1830.  They  had 
seven  children,  two  of  whom,  Thomas  and  Nancy, 
live  in  Wayne  County,  and  two,  Daniel  and  William, 
in  this  township.  The  father  died  in  1848  aged  sev- 
enty years,  and  the  mother  four  months  previously  at 
the  age  of  sixty-eight  years.  Both  were  consistent 
members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  Their 
deceased  children  are  Thornton,  Bartley  and  Mary. 
Our  subject  was  married  in  1838,  to  Mary,  daughter 
of  John  M.  Layson.  He  resided  in  Wayne  County 
till  1849,  at  which  time  he  came  to  his  present  place. 
Eight  children  have  been  born  to  this  union,  six  of 
whom  are  now  living:  John,  Sarah,  Nancy  A.,  Mary 
E.,  Isaac  and  Ffancenia;  Elmira  and  Susan  are  de- 
ceased. Mr.  and  Mrs.  Burris  have  been  members  of 
the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  for  many  years.  Our 
subject  owns  at  present  350  acres  of  good  land,  but 
before  settling  homes  on  his  children  he  was  one  of 
the  largest  land-holders  in  the  county.  His  fortune 
is  the  result  of  his  own  enterprise,  he  being  a  self-

CALVIN  BURTON,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship, one  of  the  earliest  settlers  of  this  county,  was 
born  in  South  Carolina,  July  29,  1805;  son  of  Doug- 
las and  Nancy  (Osborn)  Burton,  who  settled  in  Ken- 
tucky in  October,  1813,  and  resided  there  till  Octo- 
ber, 1819,  when  they  moved  to  this  county.  Here  on 
the  wooded  farm  Mr.  Burton's  father  died  July  26, 
l820.  There  were  twelve  children  in  the  family, 
eleven  of  whom  came  with  their  parents  to  this  coun- 
ty, and  most  of  whom  became  actual  settlers  of  the 
same.  The  mother  died  February  12,  1853.  She 
was  a  woman  of  many  graces  of  character,  an  exem- 
plary member  of  the  Christian  Church.  After  her 
husband's  death,  with  a  heroism  worthy  of  a  pioneer 
mother,  and  by  the  help  of  her  two  sons,  Calvin  and 
Thomas,    she    kept   her   children    together    and    the

wolf  from  the  door  till  they  grew  to  manhood,  respect- 
ability and  usefulness.  Calvin,  our  subject,  was 
fourteen  years  old  when  he  came  to  the  wilds  of  Indi- 
ana. His  father  dying,  the  care  of  the  family  large 
ly  devolve!  upon  him,  and  this  prevented  him  from 
obtaining  the  ordinary  common  school  education.  He 
was  married  January  0,  1828,  to  Anne  A.,  daughter 
of  John  D.  and  Marian  (Scott)  Stewart,  who  came  to 
this  locality  in  1821.  After  his  marriage  Mr.  Bur- 
ton located  upon  the  present  site  of  the  Connersville 
Cemetery,  where  he  remained  about  two  years,  and 
then  moved  to  his  present  farm,  which  he  rented 
until  he  purchased  it  in  1836.  Here  he  has  since 
resided.  He  began  life  with  little  save  a  good  wife 
and  a  willingness  to  work,  and  right  well  they  have 
done  their  part.  Mr.  Burton  has  seventy-six  acres 
of  well-improved  land,  and  enjoys  all  the  necessary 
comforts  of  life.  He  is  a  Republican,  though  his 
first  Presidential  vote  was  cast  for  Andrew  Jackson 
in  1828.  John  D.  Stewart,  father  of  Mrs.  Burton, 
was  born  in  Maryland,  May  8,  1782.  Ho  was  reared 
in  his  native  county,  and  in  1802  was  married  in 
Delaware  to  Miss  Marian  Scott,  by  whom  seven  chil- 
dren were  born,  two  only  now  living — Anna  and 
John.  Mr.  Stewart  died  February  21, 1823,  his  wid- 
ow June  29,  1839.  His  son  William  was  at  one  time 
editor  of  the  Connersville  Observer,  and  became  noted 
as  a  journalist.  Mrs.  Burton  was  born  in  Delaware, 
February  21,  1810.  She  is'  a  member  of  the  Method- 
ist Episcopal  Church,  and  possesses  much  vigor  of 
mind.  Her  memory  is  very  retentive,  and  from  her 
store  of  local  facts  the  writer  has  largely  drawn. 

JOSEPH  CALDWELL,  farmer,  Harrison  Town- 
ship. This  highly-esteemed  citizen  and  pioneer  set- 
tler of  the  county  is  a  native  of  Preble  County, 
Ohio,  where  his  birth  occurred  August  15,  1809. 
His  parents  were  Joseph  and  Miriam  (Chadwick) 
Caldwell,  natives  of  North  Carolina,  and  both  mem- 
bers of  the  Society  of  Friends.  Joseph  Caldwell, 
Sr.,  in  the  early  part  of  the  century  immigrated  to 
Ohio,  stopping  for  a  season  or  so  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  Great  Miami  River,  in  Warren  County;  from 
thence  he  removed  to  the  vicinity  of  Fair  Haven,  in 
Preble  County,  the  same  State.  In  1811  he  located 
in  what  is  now  Harrison  Township,  this  county, 
where  on  Christmas  Day  he  completed  his  cabin;  but 
the  Indians  becoming  troublesome,  the  family  re- 
turned to  Preble  County,  Ohio,  for  a  time.  Finally 
a  fort  was  built  one  mile  north  of  what  is  now  Har- 
risburg,  and  soldiers  sent  to  garrison  it,  and  the 
family  then  went  there,  living  in  this  part  until 
peace  was  restored,  when  they  moved  into  the  cabin. 
The  sons  and  daughters  born  to  Joseph  Caldwell,  Sr., 
and  wife  were:  Margaret,  John,  Mary,  James,  Ann, 
Lydia  and  Joseph,  all  deceased    save  Lydia  and  Jo- 


seph. The  father  was  a  successful  farmer  and  a 
resj)ected  citizen.  Politically  he  voted  with  the 
Whig  party,  being  a  strong  anti-slavery  man.  His 
death  occurred  in  the  fall  of  1850,  his  wife  having 
preceded  him  in  1836.  Our  subject  received  the  ben- 
efit of  a  practical  education  in  the  district  schools  of 
his  time,  and  through  his  long  life  has  been  a  tiller 
of  the  soil,  in  which  vocation  he  has  been  reasonably 
successful.  He  now  possesses  the  old  homestead, 
some  156  acres  of  land  finely  improved.  January  31, 
1888,  he  was  married  to  Miss  Asenath  Powell,  and  to 
them  were  born:  Enoch,  Martha  (wife  of  Buel  J. 
Thomas),  Caroline  and  Alexander.  Mrs.  Caldwell 
died  November  3,  1844,  and  our  subject  was  married 
on  the  second  occasion,  October  7,  1847,  to  Miss 
Salenah  Saxon,  a  native  of  Indiana,  by  whom  he  had 
two  children:  Horace  F.  and  Alice,  now  the  wife  of 
Homer  L.  Broaddus.  Mr.  Caldwell  as  Deputy  once 
appraised  the  real  estate  of  the  township,  has  several 
times  assessed  the  personal  property  thereof,  and  has 
served  as  Inspector  of  Elections.  In  1850  he  took 
the  census  of  one  of  the  three  districts  of  the  coun- 
ty, comprising  the  Townships  of  Connersville,  Harri- 
son and  Orange;  also  enrolled  Harrison  Township 
during  the  last  war.  He  cast  his  first  Presidential 
vote  for  Gen.  Jackson,  but  has  since  voted  with  the 
Whig  and  Republican  parties.  He  is  well  preserved 
for  one  of  his  years. 

ENOCH  CALDWELL,  farmer  and  cheese  manu- 
facturer, Harrison  Township,  was  born  in  Harrison 
Township,  this  county,  October  29,  1833;  a  son  of 
Joseph  Caldwell,  who  located  in  Fayette  County  in 
1811.  Our  subject  received  a  common  school  educa- 
tion, and  has  farmed  all  his  life,  excepting  in  the 
winters  from  1855  to  1865,  during  which  time  he 
taught  school.  He  was  married.  May  17,  1864,  to 
Miss  Sarah  J.  Scott,  a  native  of  Wayne  County,  Ind., 
born  September  14,  1843.  To  this  union  were  born 
five  children:  Cora  C,  Sylvia  M.,  Myrtle  E.,  Alice 
M.  and  Scott.  Mr.  Caldwell,  his  wife  and  daughter 
Cora  C,  are  members  of  the  Christian  Church.  He 
was  Justice  of  the  Peace  for  eight  years.  His  enter- 
prising spirit  induced  him  to  establish  a  cheese  fac- 
tory in  1878,  in  connection  with  the  farming  busi- 
ness; he  now  milks  from  thirty  to  fifty  cows,  and 
produces  fine  cheese,  for  which  he  finds  ready  sale.

County,  Ind.,  and  up  to  its  close  he  had  speculated 
quite  extensively  in  land,  having  in  1845  purchased

other extensive  land  purchase  and  sale  which  involved 
considerable  money  and  none  the  less  business  judge- 
ment and  foresight,  yet  he  was  not  wanting  in  the 
latter  nor  in  nerve  for  so  great  an  investment,  for 
time  proved  the  success  of  the  speculation,    which

closed  it  up.  Mr.  Claypool  was  conspicuously  iden- 
tified with  many  of  the  internal  improvements  of  the 
Whitewater  Valley,  and  closely  allied  with  agricult- 
ural interests  of  the  county  and  to  the  public  has

ure. He  was  instrumental  in  the  organization  of 
the  Bentonville  &amp;  Lockport  Turnpike  Company,

his  father,  in  1866,  Mr.  Claypool  inherited  the  old 
country  homestead  and  moved  upon  it,  where  he  has 
since  resided,  in  the  meantime  having  platted  that 
portion  of  the  homestead  where  the  beautiful  village 
of  Maplewood  is  located.  He  is  a  member  of  the 
I.  O.  O.  F.  and  Masonic  orders,  having  represented 
both  in  their  respective  Grand  Lodges.  In  politics 
he  is  a  Republican.  He  is  a  very  affable  gentleman,

ship, was  born  in  Fayette  County,  Ind. ,  on  the  farm 
where  he  now  resides,  October  18,  1829,  son  of 
George  and  Nancy  (Dill)  Creelman,  natives  of  Ireland, 
the  former  of  whom  was  a  son  of  William  Creelman, 
also  a  native  of  Ireland,  where  he  married  Rosannah 
Crawford,  who  died  there  in  1818.  In  1819  he  immi- 
grated to  Ohio,  settling  first  in  Preble  County,  and 
in  1821  removed  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  settling  on 
a  farm  four  miles  southeast  of  Connersville,  where  he 
remained  until  his  death.  He  was  the  father  of  seven 
children:  Barbara,  who  died  in  Ireland  in  1818; 
Mary,  who  died  in  Ireland  some  years  after;  Margaret, 
Jane,  Rosannah,  Nancy  and  George,  the  father  of 
our  subject,  who  was  nest  to  the  youngest  of  the  chil- 
dren and  the  only  son.  He  was  born  in  Ballywaney, 
County  Antrim,  Ireland,  in  May,  1786,  and  came  with 
his  father  to  Ohio  in  1819.  In  1820  he  came  to  Con- 
nersville, prospecting,  and  shortly  after  returned  to 
Ohio.  In  1821,  in  company  with  his  father,  he  came 
back  to  Fayette  County,  and  was  here  married  to 
Nancy,  daughter  of  .David  and  Margaret  (Campbell) 
Dill.  Her  parents  were  natives  of  Ireland  and  came 
to  the  United  States  in  1820,  and  in  1822  to  Fayette 
County,  Ind.  She  was  born  in  Aughadreena,  County 
Donegal,  Ireland,  in  1789.  After  marriage  Mr. 
Creelman  settled  on  the  farm  where  our  subject  now 
lives,  which  he  improved  from  its  wild  state  and  on 
which  he  remained  until  the  fall  of  1844.  From 
1844  to  1846  he  resided  near  Rushville,  Ind.,  and 
removed  in  the  latter  year  to  Randolph  County,  111., 
where  he  remained  until  1854,  when  he  came  to  his 
old  farm  in  Fayette  County,  Ind.  Here  he  resided 
until  his  death,  which  occurred  March  7,  1880,  his 
wife  having  preceded  him  September  24,  1862. 
Their  children  were — Margaret  A.,  who  died  Septem- 
ber 4,  1855,  at  the  age  of  twenty-seven  years,  eight 
months  and  four  days,  and  William  G.,  our  subject, 
who  remained  with  his  father  up  to  the  letter's  death. 
He  now  owns  and  lives  on  the  old  homestead.  The 
parents  and  sister  of  our  subject  were  consistent 
members  of  the  Reformed  Presbyterian  Church.  W. 
G.  Creelman,  as  was  his  father,  is  a  Republican  in 
politics,  an  honorable,  upright  and  industrious  citi- 
zen, and  a  kind  neighbor,  a  man  possessing  paternal 
affectiou  and  appreciating  the  many  hardships  and 
privations  undergone  by  his  pioneer  parents  in  carv- 
ing out  of  the  wilderness  a  home  for  himself  and  those 
coming  after  him.

war  of  1812  he  enlisted  and  served  until  the  battle 
of  Lundy's  Lane,  where  he  received  a  severe  wound 
in  the  leg,  which  disabled  him  from  further  service. 
He  then  engaged  in  trading  with  the  Indians  for 
some  time,  and  about  1829  moved  to  Cincinnati,  Ohio, 
and  entered  the  banking  business,  which  he  pursued 
until  a  few  years  previous  to  his  death,  which  occurred 
April  25,  1868.  His  widow  is  residing  in  Cincinnati, 
Ohio.  Their  children  were:  Ann  E.,  John  M.,  Mary 
J.,  Joseph  A,  Eliza  D. ,  Henry  C,  Samuel,  Anna  M.,

W.  W.  CURTIS,  farmer,  Posey  Township,  one  of 
the  most  energetic  and  wide-awake  farmers  and  stock- 
dealers  of  Posey  Township,  was  born  in  Butler  Coun- 
ty, Ohio,  September  2,  1831.  His  parents,  Daniel 
and  Charlotte  (Pocock)  Curtis,  were  natives  of  Mary- 
land, and  in  an  early  day  moved  to  Butler  County, 
Ohio,  where  they  were  married  and  remained  until 
their  deaths.  Daniel  Curtis  was  a  soldier  in  the  war 
of  1812,  and  was  a  man  highly  respected,  himself  and 
wife  being  zealous  members  of  and  devoted  workers

County,  Ind.,  settling  at  Connersville,  where  he 
practiced  law  for  some  time,  and  afterward  moved  on 
a  farm  five  miles  west,  and  here  he  engaged  in  farm- 


ing in  addition  to  carrying  on  his  profession.  He 
was  elected  Bank  Director  of  Indiana,  in  which 
capacity  he  served  until  his  death,  which  occurred 
March  11,  1855.  His  widow  survived  him  about 
thirteen  years.  They  had  a  family  of  ten  children: 
William,  Ellen,  Charles,  Aaron,  Jesse  J.,  John,  Eliz- 
abeth, Sarah,  Mary  and  Anna.  J.  J.,  our  subject,

his  vicinity,  where  he  received  a  thorough  common 
school  education,  and  in  1846  he  began  the  study  of 
medicine  (his  brother  William  being  his  preceptor 
for  four  years),  after  which  he  attended  the  Eclectic 
Medical  College  of  Cincinnati,  Ohio.  On  November 
19,  1850,  he  was  united  in  marriage  with  Miriam  H.

tended lectures  again  at  the  Eclectic  Medical  College 
of  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  completing  his  education,  and 
subsequently  moved  to  Oxford,  Benton  Co.,  Ind., 
where  he  began  the  practice  of  medicine,  which  he 
pursued  there  until  1864,  at  which  time  he  removed 
to  this  county,  where  he  has  since  remained,  engaged 
in  the  practice  of  medicine  and  in  farming  to  some 
extent.  The  Doctor  owns  115  acres  of  very  tine,  well- 
improved  land,  brought  under  a  high  state  of  cultiva- 
tion. He  is  a  practical  physician,  well  respected  by 
all  who  know  him.  He  is  a  F.  &amp;  A.  M.  and  a  mem-

JASPER  N.  DAVIS,  Sr.,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  came  to  this  county  with  his  parents  in 
1814  and  is  therefore  one  of  the  earliest  settlers  of 
this  locality.  He  was  born  in  South  Carolina,  Sep- 
tember 25,  1812,  and  was  but  two  years  of  age  when 
he  became  an  inhabitant  of  this  then  unbroken  fron 
tier.  His  parents  were  natives  of  the  Carolinas,  de- 
scendants of  the  hardy  and  intelligent  Scotch-Irish. 
They  had  nine  children,  all  of  whom  grew  to  matur- 
ity and  have  since  passed  away,  except  Dulcina  (now 
Mrs.  Caldwell)  and  Jasper  N.  The  father  died  in 
1858,  the  mother  having  preceded  him  in  1849.  Mr. 
Davis  lived  with  his  parents  till  twenty-nine  years  of 
age.  He  obtained  a  fair  education  in  the  common 
schools  of  the  neighborhood,  supplementing  this  by 
a  few  months'  study  in  the  schools  of  Connersville. 
An  afiliction  in  the  form  of  white  swelling  visited 
him  when  at  the  age  of  nine  years,  rendering  him  a 
cripple  for  life  and  necessitating  the  adoption  of 
light  physical  labor  as  a  means  of  subsistence.  Accor- 
dingly he  took  up  the  profession  of  teaching,  in  which 
he  continued  during  a  series  of  seven  terms  and  then 
engaged  in  the  nursery  business,  which  chiefly  occu- 
pied his  time  and  attention  for  twenty  years,  though 
he  did  some  farming  and  transacted  public  business

in  the  meantime.  In  1865  lie  turned  his  attention  to 
farming  exclusively,  and  has  since  been  engaged  in 
that  pursuit.  From  his  father's  estate  Mr.  Davis  in- 
herited a  good  farm  on  which  he  resided  till  1882, 
when  he  sold  out  and  purchased  his  present  home  of 
forty  acres.  He  was  married  in  June,  1842,  to  Mi- 
randa S.  White,  a  native  of  Fleming  County,  Ky. ,  and 
daughter  of  Nelson  and  Elizabeth  (Perry)  White. 
Their  children  are — Helen  M.,  now  Mrs.  Alexander; 
Horace  C,  and  Elizabeth  A.  (deceased).  In  1838  Mr. 
Davis  served  as  County  Collector  and  has  several 
times  been  elected  to  the  office  of  Township  Assessor. 
He  is  highly  esteemed  by  the  people  in  his  communi- 
ty, both  for  his  sterling  qualities  as  a  citizen  aud  his 
amiable  character  as  a  man. 

JASPER  N.  DAVIS,  Jr.,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  was  born  in  this  county  March  11,  1834, 
and  is  a  descendant  of  Thomas  J.  and  Maria  (Ball) 
Davis,  who  were  among  the  first  settlers  of  this  coun- 
ty. His  paternal  grandfather  came  from  South  Car- 
olina, and  his  grandfather  Ball  from  Georgia.  His 
parents  were  highly  respected  farmers.  His  father 
died  in  1856;  his  mother  is  still  living.  Mr.  Davis 
resided  with  his  parents  till  grown  to  manhood,  and 
obtained  a  fair  education  in  the  district  schools.  He 
was  married  at  the  age  of  twenty-six  to  Parmelia  A., 
daughter  of  Benjamin  Clifford,  of  Harrison  Town- 
ship, and  to  this  union  were  born  six  children:  Mary 
M.,  Charles  E.,  James  M.,  Wheeler  C,  Benjamin  F. 
and  Clarence  U.  After  his  marriage  Mr.  Davis  rented 
land  for  several  years,  and  then  purchased  eighty 
acres  in  Fairview  Township.  About  eight  years  later 
he  sold  this  farm  at  a  handsome  profit  and  then  pur- 
chased his  present  one  of  120  acres,  for  which  he 
paid  the  sum  of  $10,400.  Here  he  has  since  been 
quite  successfully  engaged  in  the  quiet  pursuits  of 
farm  life,  including  stock-raising.  His  success  in 
rearing  hogs  is  perhaps  unequaled  by  any  other 
farmer  in  the  county.  On  his  farm  is  a  tine  pond, 
arranged  expressly  for  the  cultivation  of  German 
carp,  a  fish  of  which  he  has  some  very  fine  specimens. 
He  is  one  of  the  most  energetic  farmers  of  this  coun- 
ty, and  his  industry  has  been  rewarded  by  an  abund- 
ant harvest  of  the  comforts  of  life.

cation. He  was  married  October  27,  1875,  to  Miss 
Kate  Nichols,  and  by  this  union  their  home  has  been 
made  more  cheerful  by  the  addition  of  a  bright  and 
shining  light  in  the  person  of  their  little  daughter — 
Nellie  May.

remaining  there  one  year  he  removed  to  the  farm 
where  he  now  lives.  He  is  at  present  Trustee  of  Fair- 
view  Township,  which  office  he  has  held  two  terms. 
He  is  a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F. 

WILLIAM  A.  DUNCAN,  farmer,  Harrison  Town- 
ship, is  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  born  in  Franklin 
County,  January  26, 1826.  His  parents,  Joseph  and 
Jane  (MacNichols)  Duncan,  came  to  this  State  in 
1850.  His  father,  a  native  [of  Pennsylvania,  died 
May  4,  1860;  his  mother  died  December  15,  1858. 
Our  subject  had  a  very  limited  education.  He  was 
married  Juno  25,  1861,  to  Miss  Mary  Fallen,  born  in 
1831,  daughter  of  John  and  Ann  (Padden)  Fallen,

B.  F.  DUNGAN,  farmer,  Waterloo  Township, 
was  born  December  24,  1836,  in  the  township  in 
which  he  now  resides,  and  the  district  schools  afforded 
him  the  only  means  for  an  education.  He  was  mar- 
ried May  28,  1865,  to  Elizabeth,  daughter  of  Richard 
and  Susanna  Strong,  who  has  borne  him  two  children: 
Mary  M.  and  William  A.  He  owns  eighty  acres  of 
land,  which  are  finely  improved.  Mr.  Dungan  has 
served  three  terms  as  Trustee  of  the  township,  and 
Assessor  six  years.  Politically  he  is  a  Democrat. 
Benjamin  Dungan,  grandfather  of  our  subject,  was  a 
native  of  Virginia.  He  was  married  to  Margaret 
Mitchell,  and  in  1814  removed  with  his  family  to 
Waterloo  Township,  where  he  entered  160  acres  of 
land  in  Section  10.  Although  not  a  professor  of

years,  he  and  his  wife  removed  to  Delaware  County, 
Ind.,  where  they  died.  Isaac,  brother  of  Benjamin, 
came  to  the  township  some  years  after,  receiving  from 
his  brother  ten  acres  of  land  as  an  inducement  to 
settle  here.  William  M.,  son  of  Benjamin  and  father 
of  our  subject,  was  born  September  8,  1814.  He  was 
married  March  2,  1836,  in  Fayette  County,  to  Rachel,

271 


in  Maryland,  June  28,  1778,  a  son  of  Rev.  James 
and  Nancy  (Tracy)  Chambers.  He  was  reared  in  his 
native  State, 'after  which  he  removed  to  North  Caro- 
lina, where  he  was  married  to  Margaret  Brown.  Sub- 
sequently they  settled  in  Kentucky,  from  which  State 
they  removed  to  Wayne  County,  Ind.,  and  in  1812 
settled  permanently  in  Waterloo  Township,  Section 
33,  where  he  died.  He  held  several  of  the  township 
oflBces  and  was  an  efficient  business  man.  He  was 
not  a  member  of  any  denomination,  yet  was  religiously 
inclined,  and  gave  freely  toward  the  support  of  the 
church.  He  served  a  short  time  in  the  war  of  1812- 
14.  His  wife  was  a  member  of  the  Baptist  Church 
and  a  consistent  Christian.  Nine  children  were  born 
to  them,  four  of  whom  are  now  living:  Martha, 
Rachel,  Lydia  and  Rebecca.  The  deceased  are  Lin- 
nie,  James,  Jesse,  Nancy,  and  William  F.  Mr. 
Chambers  died  June  8,  1850;  his  widow,  who  was 
born  January  17,  1779,  died  May  3,  1856. 

AMOS  R.  EDWARDS  (deceased),  late  of  Conners- 
ville  Township,  was  one  of  the  leading  citizens  of 
this  county,  born  in  Greene  County,  Penn.,  in  1808, 
a  son  of  William  Edwards,  a  native  of  Indiana,  where 
he  was  reared.  Our  subject's  parents  moved  to  this 
county  in  1817  and  resided  here  till  their  deaths. 
He  grew  to  manhood  here  and  was  educated  in  the 
Fayette  County  district  schools,  his  early  life  being 
spent  in  mercantile  business  in  Fairfield,  Franklin 
County,  and  Connersville,  Fayette  County.  He  sub- 
sequently purchased  land  in  this  locality  and  for  sev- 
eral years  engaged  in  farming.  About  1845  he  was 
elected  to  fill  a  vacancy  in  the  office  of  County  Clerk 
and  subsequently  served  in  that  capacity  for  twelve 
consecutive  years,  after  which  he  retired  from  active 
business.  He  was  prominently  identified  with  the 
JunctioQ  Railroad  construction  and  was  ever  in  the 
lead  in  public  enterprises  of  every  sort.  Mr.  Ed- 
wards was  married  to  Miss  Jane  Patterson,  who  was 
born  and  reared  in  Ohio,  and  by  this  union  four  chil- 
dren were  born:  Alexander,  Elizabeth  (deceased), 
Alfred  (deceased),  and  Francis.  Mr.  Edwards  died 
December  29,  1864;  his  widow  is  still  living. 

ALEXANDER  EDWARDS,  farmer,  Conn(»-8ville 
Township,  was  born  in  this  county  in  1835;  son  of 
Amos  R.  and  Jane  (Patterson)  Edwards.  Our  sub- 
ject's early  life  was  passed  partly  on  the  farm  and 
partly  in  the  town  of  Connersville,  in  the  public 
schools  of  which  place  he  was  educated.  Since  his 
maturity  he  has  been  chiefly  and  quite  extensively 
engaged  in  farming  and  stock-raising,  in  which  he 
has  been  very  successful.  He  now  owns  246  acres 
of  excellent  land,  well  provided  with  tine  buildings 
and  all  modern  conveniences.  Mr.  Edwards  was 
united  in  marriage,  December  24,  1862,  with  Catha- 
rine Sparks,  a  native  of  this  county  and    a   daughter 


of  William  Sparks,  one  of  the  most  notable  of  the 
pioneers.  Mr.  Edwards  is  an  industrious,  energetic 
farmer,  and,  though  careful  in  his  dealings,  is  a  lib- 
eral supporter  of  all  legitimate  enterprises. 

JESSE  P.  ELLIOTT,  Jennings  Township.  This 
enterprising  and  progressive  farmer  of  Fayette 
County  was  born  in  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  August 
19,  1826.  When  seven  years  old  (1833)  his  father, 
John  Elliott,  removed  to  and  settled^  in  Union 
County,  Ind.,  near  the  mouth  of  Eli's  Creek,  where 
he  lived  five  years,  after  which  he  settled  in  this 
township,  and  though  he  subseqiiently  lived  in  other 
places,  always  remained  in  the  county.  John  Elliott 
was  born  in  Culpeper  County,  Va. ,  January  10,  1800, 
a  son  of  Elijah  and  Elizabeth  (Figins)  Elliott,  na- 
tives of  Virginia,  who  settled  in  Bracken  County,  Ky., 
in  1802.  Elijah  Elliott  served  on  the  northern  front- 
ier in  the  war  of  1812-1815.  He  was  one  of  Maj. 
Croghan's  gallant  little  band  that  so  heroically  de- 
fended Fort  Stephenson  after  refusing  the  British 
demand  for  surrender.  He  was  tomahawked  and 
killed  by  the  Indians  on  the  River  Raisin,  Canada. 
Before  going  to  the  war  he  leased  his  slaves  for  a 
term  of  years;  on  account  of  his  premature  death 
the  lessee  violated  the  terms  of  the  contract  by  con- 
tinuing to  hold  the  slaves  in  bondage,  after  the  expi- 
ration of  the  lease.  Previous  to  the  late  war  of  the 
Rebellion  John  Elliott,  son  of  Elijah,  procured  their 
freedom.  John  Elliott,  the  father  of  our  subject,  was 
married  in  Kentucky,  to  Rachel,  daughter  of  Jesse 
and  Lurany  (Newland)  Pigman,  born  July  2,  1805. 
In  1833  they  with  their  children — three  in  number — 
settled  in  Indiana  as  above  stated.  Both  were  mem- 
bers of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  and  consist- 
ent Christians  whose  labors  of  love  ended  only  with 
their  lives.  Mr.  Elliott  was  something  of  a  genius, 
possessing  that  rare  mechanical  ingenuity  which  en- 
abled him  to  produce  whatever  his  fertile  mind 
devised.  With  the  aid  of  a  whip  saw  he  helped  to 
get  out  the  lumber  used  in  the  construction  of  the 
first  court  house  built  in  Rush  County,  Ind.  This 
pioneer  couple  left  their  Kentucky  home  on  account 
of  slavery  and  poverty.  When  they  arrived  here 
they  had  only  a  team  and  a  few  household  utensils. 
Mr.  Elliott  was  a  man  of  good  judgment,  a  hard 
worker,  generous  to  a  fault,  giving  to  the  support  of 
every  worthy  public  enterprise.  He  was  a  war  Dem- 
ocrat, and  during  the  late  war  of  the  Rebellion  gave 
from  his  large  means  with  unstinted  hand,  to  aid 
the  Government  in  the  struggle.  He  was  unassum- 
ing and  reticent  in  manner.  He  was  parent  of 
eleven  children,  the  three  eldest  of  whom — Jesse  P., 
Charles  W.,  and  Elijah — were  born  in  Kentucky;  the 
others — Elizabeth  (deceased),  James  M.,  John  (de- 
ceased),   Lurany   (deceased),    Sarah    (deceased),     an

Elliott  married,  for  his  second  wife,  Margaret 
Shields.  He  died  September  13,  1873.  Our  subject 
up  to  his  eighteenth  year  lived  upon  the  farm, 
attending  the  district  schools,  where  he  obtained  a 
good  practical  education.  He  was  married,  March 
9,  1847,  to  Nancy,  daughter  of  Robert  Hulgan,  and 
who  was  born  in  1819.  To  this  union  were  born 
four  children,  three  of  whom  are  now  living:  John, 
Rachel  Ann,  and  Nancy  J.  Mary  is  deceased.  Mrs. 
Elliott  died  in  1853.  He  then  married,  January  7, 
1855,  Margaret  Darby,  who  bore  him  seven  children: 
Mary  E.,  Jesse  (deceased),  Catherine  (deceased),  Fan- 
nie B.,  Emma,  Frances  A.  (deceased)  and  Charles. 
Daniel  O.  Darby,  the  father  of  Mrs.  Elliott,  was  born 
in  Butler  County,  Ohio,  in  1806,  a  son  of  William 
and  Mary  (Fritz)  Darby,  the  former  of  Welsh,  the 
latter  of  German  extraction.  Williau]  O.  settled  in 
Columbia  Township  in  1825,  subsequently  moved 
near  Indianapolis,  where  he  died.  Daniel  O.  Darby 
settled  in  the  above  mentioned  township  in  1828. 
He  was  a  mechanic  and  noted  for  being  a  general 
purpose  man.  He  was  Justice  of  the  Peace  and 
Constable  several  terms  each,  and  Postmaster  for  sev- 
eral years.  In  1862  he  enlisted  in  the  Fourth  Ind. 
V.  C,  and  participated  in  the  famous  Morgan  raid. 
His  wife,  Hannah  Hopkins  [nee  Lovelace),  bore  him 
nine  children:  Margarett,  William  O.,  Nancy,  John 
D.,  Sarah  J.,  Luciiida,  Elizabeth,  Lucinda  (second), 
Elizabeth  (second).  Mr.  Darby  died  in  1875.  His 
wife,  who  was  born  in  Monmouth  County,  N.  J., 
in  1799,  died  in  1865.  Her  father  and  mother, 
Joseph  and  Mary  Lovelace,  were  of  English  and 
Scotch  extraction.  By  her  first  husband,  Mr.  Hop- 
kins, she  had  three  children:  Mary,  Emily  and  Joseph. 
For  seventeen  years  the  subject  of  this  sketch  operated 
a  saw-mill  in  Fayette  County.  At  the  beginning  of 
the  late  war  he  bought  (in  partnership  with  James 
Hulgan)  128  acres  of  land  where  he  now  resides.  He 
has  been  eminently  successful  and  now  owns  454 
acres  of  well-improved  land.  His  home  farm  of  203 
acres  is  one  of  the  best  improved  places  in  the 
county.  His  commodious  house,  erected  in  1882,  at 
a  cost  of  15,000,  is  without  an  equal  in  the  town- 
ship for  convenience,  etc.  It  was  erected  to  replace 
one  built  in  1876,  at  a  cost  of  14,000,  destroyed 
by  lire  in  1882.  Mr.  Elliott  has  been  elected  to  the 
ofiSces  of  Trustee  and  Justice  of  the  Peace,  discharg- 
ing the  duties  of  each  in  a  creditable  manner.  His 
commission  for  the  latter  office  was  issued  by  Gov. 
O.  P.  Morton.  Mr.  Elliott  possesses  good  business 
ability;  is  a  shrewd,  far-seeing  man,  seldom  making 
an  error  in  business  speculations.     While  living  in 


Columbia  Township  he  assessed  the  personal  property 
and  in  1867  or  1868  assessed  most  of  the  real  estate 
of  the  county.  He  is  an  acceptable  and  worthy 
member  of  Warren  Lodge,  No.  15,  F.  &amp;  A.  M.,  at 
Connersville,  and  of  Evertou  Lodge,  I.  O.  O.  F.  He

CHARLES  W.  ELLIOTT,  farmer,  Jackson  Town- 
ship, is  a  native  of  Kentucky,  born  near  Brookville, 
Bracken  County,  April  15,  1828.  He  was  favored 
with  a  graded  school  education,  and  farmed  with  his 
father  until  1847.  Being  naturally  inclined  to  form 
and  de.sign  that  which  would  be  useful  in  life,  he 
learned  the  blacksmith  trade,  and  after  becoming  an 
expert  at  it,  went  to  California  in  1849.  Shortly 
after  his  arrival  there  he  was  seized  with  the  Panama 
fever,  and  returned  home  in  1850;  taught  school  in 
1851,  and  cradled  wheat  and  farmed  during  the  har- 
vest, after  which  he  engaged  in  all  kinds  of  work, 
being  an  expert  in  mechanics.  Mr.  Elliott  was  mar- 
ried, December  18,  1855,  to  Amanda  A.  Smallwood, 
who  was  born  in  Loudoun  County,  Va.,  February  24, 
1822.  After  his  wife's  death  he  married,  January 
19,  1864,  Eliza  A.  Nash,  daughter  of  Richard  Nash, 
and  who  was  born  October  13,  1841;  to  them  were 
born  five  children:  Lurena  M.,  born  March  21,  1865,

Elliott  is  liberal,  contributing  to  the  Lutheran  and 
Methodist  Churches.  His  wife  is  a  member  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church. 

LEWIS  ELLIS,  farmer,  Harrison  Township,  was 
born  in  Cayuga  County,  N.  Y.,  April  11,  1811,  son 
of  Moses  and  Betsey  (Judd)  Ellis,  natives  of  Massa- 
chusetts and  Connecticut,  respectively,  and  who  emi- 
grated to  western  New  York  about  1803  or  1804,  and 
from  there,  in  1818,  moved  to  the  vicinity  of  North 
Bend,  on  the  Ohio.  For  eight  years  they  resided  on 
the  farm  of  Gen.  Harrison,  whence,  in  1826,  they 
came  to  this  county,  settling  on  land  where  our  sub- 
ject now  resides.  They  were  parents  of  six  children. 
Both  were  members  of  the  Christian  Church,  in  which 
Mr.  Ellis  was  a  zealous  and  untiring  worker.  He  was 
exempt  from  military  service  on  account  of  near- 
sightedness. He  was  the  first  Postmaster  of  the  office 
known  as  Plum  Orchard,  established  in  1827;  was  a 
good  citizen,  and  succeeded  well  in  life.  Politically, 
he  was  a  Whig,  with  strong  anti-slavery  views.  He 
died  in  1848,  his  wife  having  preceded  him  in  1841.

three  children:  George,  William  and  Barbara  Ann. 
Our  subject  received  most  of  his  education  iu  the 
schools  of  Indiana.  He  worked  fourteen  years  at 
farm  labor  by  the  month.  In  1849  he  was  married 
to  Martha  Cross,  by  whom  he  has  had  six  children, 
five  now  living:  Susanna  E.,  Levi,  George,  William 
and  Anna.  Samantha  is  deceased.  In  1856  Mr.  Green 
rented  the  farm  where  he  now  lives  and  which  he 
owns.  He  rented  land  till  1875,  when  he  bought  160 
acres,  and  in  1882  he  purchased  160  iicres  more,  pay- 
ing for  the  two  farms  $20,000.  Mr.  Green  votes  for 
the  Democl-atic  Presidential  nominees,  but  in  local 
elections  supports  the  best  man,  regardless  of  party 
lines.

SAMUEL  GREST,  farmer,  Jackson  Township, 
is  a  native  of  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  born  in  Jackson 
Township,  July  12,  1814.  His  parents,  Samuel  and 
Sarah  (Smith)  Grest,  were  born  in  South  Carolina, 
and  came  to  Indiana  in  1813,  enduring  the  hardships 
and  privations  incident  to  pioneer  life,  that  their 
progeny  might  possess  more  of  this  world's  goods 
than  they  themselves  ever  enjoyed.  The  subject  of 
this  sketch  received  a  common  school  education,  and 
worked  at  the  carpenter's  trade  for  twelve  years, 
with  which  exception  his  life  has  been  devoted  to 
farming.  August  13,  1840,  he  married  Miss  Matilda

HAWKINS  HACKLEMAN,  farmer,  Harrison 
Township.  It  was  some  time  during  the  period  of 
colonial  development  that  the  name  of  Hackleman 
first  became  known  on  the  western  continent.  Three 
brothers,  casting  their  fortunes  with  many  others, 
sailed  from  Germany,  and  upon  reaching  North  Amer- 
ica settled  within  what  are  now  the  present  limits  of 
Mississippi.  After  a  time  one  of  the  brothers,  by  the 
name  of  Jacob,  with  his  wife,  Mary,  moved  to  South 
Carolina.  There  they  lived,  and  their  family  of  lit- 
tle  prattling  children  grew  to    be   strong  men    and

women.      Space  forbids  us  to  speak  of  but  one  son, 
Isaac  Hackleman  (born  March  26,  1780,  died  Decem- 
ber   10,  1844),    who  was  married  July  2,   1801,    to 
Elizabeth  Hawkins  (bom  May  22,  1783,  died  July  30, 
1835).      Immediately  after  their  marriage  they  moved 
to  Dearborn  County,  Ind..  settling  on  a  farm  two  and 
a  half  miles   from  Harrison,  and   while  living  there 
Hawkins  Hackleman  was  born  January  6,  1810.     In 
1815  his  parents  moved  to  Fayette  County  and  located 
on  a   farm  near  Harrisburg.     His    earliest   recollec- 
tions of  the  county  are  far  different  from  the  observa- 
tions taken  to-day.      Instead  of  the  broad,  cultivated 
fields  of   ripening  grain,  and  the  rich  meadow  lands 
where  the  low    of  the    browsing  cattle   is  heard,  he 
then  saw  the  giant  trees  of  the  forest  mingling  their 
branches  together;  while  here  and  there  a  small  clear- 
ing and   a    log-house  showed   that  the    pioneers  had 
begun  in  earnest  to  carve  out    a  home  for  themselves 
and   their  children.      He  remembers  when   Conners- 
ville  contained  only  a  block-house   and  three  or  four 
log-cabins.     His  first  school  teacher  was  Miss  Millie 
Perrin.     The  schoolhouse  was  made  of  the  most  fash- 
ionable building    material  of  the    day,  namely,  logs. 
On  one  side  part  of  one  log  had  been  removed,  and 
over   the   opening  was  pasted  an   oiled    paper,  thus 
forming  a  window.      A  spacious  tire-place,  almost  the 
width   of  one  side  of  the  house,  not    only    gave  out 
heat,  but  also  assisted  the  one  window  in  lighting  up 
the  rude  mansion  of  learning.     A  puncheon  floor  and 
benches  without  backs,    together  with    the    master's 
ferule,  completed   the  furniture    of    the    apartment. 
And   yet,  despite  these  disadvantages,  he  obtained  a 
fair  education.      As  was  customary  in  those  days,  he 
attended  the  "Musters,"  which  convened   three  times 
a  year;  he  belonged  to  Capt  William  Dickey's  divis- 
ion, known  as  the  "  Flat-foot  Company."     From  the 
time  he  was  about  seventeen  years  of  age  he  generally 
made  four  or  five  trips  to  Cincinnati    during  the  fall 
and   winter    months,    driving    hogs    at     25     cents 
per  day.     During  the  summer  of  1828  he  worked  for 
twQ  months  with  Nelson  Penwell  making  shoes  at  16 
per   month.     He  was  married  to   Sally  A.  Wolfe  by 
Rev.  Adam  Banks,    Pastor  of  the  Christian  Church, 
Thursday    afternoon,  December  29,  1831.     His  wife 
was   a  daughter  of  David  Wolfe.     She   was  born  in 
Scott  County,  Ky. ,  near  Georgetown,   November  29, 
1814,  and  moved  with  her  parents  to  Fayette  County, 
Ind.,  in  1824.     Their  marriage  was  in  harmony  with 
the  customs  of  early  times.      Huge  dinner-pots  hung 
from  the  cranes  in  the  chimney,  and  frying-pans  and 
skillets  did    good    service   on    the    glowing    coals. 
Young   Hawkins,  unassisted,  had  made  his  wedding 
shoes,  while  his  girl  bride,  with  her  own  hands,  had 
constructed  the  white  dress  that  served  as  a  wedding 
robe.     The  next  day  the    young  married  couple,  in 


company  with  friends,  mounted  their  horses  and  rode 
to  the  "  Inf  air. "  In  1832  they  moved  to  Rush 
County,  and  for  two  years  he  was  engaged  in  mer- 
cantile business.  In  1834  they  came  back  to  Fayette 
County,  and  since  1837  have  lived  at  their  present 
home.  Nine  children  have  been  born  unto  them: 
Fannie,  the  eldest,  was  born  in  Rush  County;  James, 
Jacob,  William  (died  in  infancy),  Thomas,  Charles, 
George,  Emily  (died  in  1870)  and  Adelia  (deceased) 
were  born  in  Fayette  County.  He  has  thus  lived  in 
the  county,  with  the  exception  of  two  years,  since 
1815;  has  watched  its  development  with  interest  and 
pride.  His  quiet  influence  has  been  exerted  in  behalf 
of  those  improvements  that  would  help  to  make  his 
fellow-men  better  citizens,  and  promote  the  advance- 
ment of  civilization  and  education.  He  is  a  man 
well  preserved  in  mind  and  body;  and  now  at  the  age 
of  seventy-four  years  he  can  calmly  review  the  past, 
and  find  no  deeds  in  his  life  so  dark  that  he  would 
wish  to  bury  them  forever  from  sight  No  regi-ets  of 
misspent  years  of  degradation  and  moral  depravity 
prove  an  annoyance  to  him.  He  has  led  a  life  tem- 
perate in  all  things.  "As  harvest  time  is  brighter 
than  seed  time,  so  is  old  age  brighter  than  youth, 
provided  its  youth  was  the  receptacle  of  good  seed." 

JAMES  S.  HAMILTON  (deceased),  late  of  Wa- 
terloo Township,  was  born  in  Maryland,  in  which 
State  his  father  died.  In  1832  his  mother,  Mrs.  Jane 
(Scott)  Hamilton,  moved  to  Indiana,  selecting  a 
location  in  Waterloo  Township,  Section  3.  James  S. 
had  previously  married  in  Virginia,  Eliza  Courtney, 
by  whom  he  had  eleven  children:  Henson  R.  (de- 
ceased), Robert  W.,  Margaret  J.  (deceased),  Thomas 
F.,  Mary  A.,  William  J.  (deceased),  and  T.  F.  The 
following  four  were  born  in  Indiana:  Eliza  R.  (de- 
ceased), Charles  H.,  John  W.  and  Francis  A.  Mr. 
Hamilton  held  several  of  the  township  offices,  and 
was  a  man  of  much  ability.  He  and  his  wife  were 
Methodists.  He  was  a  successful  farmer,  accumula- 
ting considerable  property.  He  served  as  a  soldier  in 
the  war  of  1812,  stationed  at  Norfolk,  Va.  He  died 
in  1878,  his  wife  having  preceded  him  in  1872,  aged 
about  sixty-nine  years.  Charles  H.  Hamilton  was 
born  in  this  township  in  1834.  He  was  married  in 
1859  to  Rachel  Strong,  daughter  of  Richard  and  Su- 
sanna Strong,  who  came  here  from  Virginia  in  1813 
or  1814.  Richard  Strong  was  born  June  15,  1790, 
and  died  February  15,  1848;  his  widow,  Susanna 
(Gaby)  Strong,  was  born  June  9,  1802,  died  Novem 
ber  9,  1883.  They  had  thirteen  children:  Lydia, 
Delia,  Wilson  J.,  Mary,  Jane,  Rachel,  Susan,  Eliza- 
beth, John,  Henry,  Nancy,  Henrietta  and  Millie. 
Ten  children  have  been  born  to  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Charles

KEY.  JOHN  HAMILTON,  Posey  Township,  is  a 
native  of  Fayette  County,  Penn.,  only  child  of 
George  and  Elizabeth  (Miller)  Hamilton,  former  of 
whom  was  born  in  Maryland  in  1794,  where  he  grew 
to  manhood.  George  Hamilton  moved  to  Pennsylva- 
nia, where  he  married  Elizabeth  Miller,  and  in  1838 
came  to  Indiana,  locating  in  Jackson  Township,  this 
coanty,  where  he  lived  the  balance  of  his  days,  and 
died  in  1861.  His  wife  departed  this  life  in  1854. 
He  was  a  self-made  man.  He  served  an  apprentice- 
ship to  the  printer's  trade  in  New  York  City,  in  the 
office  of  the  Tribune,  then  conducted  by  Horace 
Greeley.  Our  subject  received  a  practical  education, 
such  as  the  district  schools  afforded,  and  on  growing 
to  manhood  was  united  in  marriage,  in  1850,  with 
Miss  Sarah,  daughter  of  Wilson  T.  Adams,  and  to  this 
union  were  born  ten  children,  the  following  of  whom 
are  living:  Nelson,  William,  David,  John,  Alanson, 
Samuel,  Mary  and  James.  The  deceased  are:  George 
and  Elizabeth.  Mr.  Hamilton  began  the  study  of 
theology  under  the  instruction  of  Rev.  Samuel  Mc- 
Key,  a  Baptist  clergyman,  and  subsequently  attended 
and  completed  his  studies  at  the  seminary  located  in 
Hartsville,  Ind.  In  1862  he  enlisted  in  Company  K, 
Sixty-ninth  Regiment  Ind.  V.  I.,  and  saw  two  years  of 
active  service,  participating  in  the  battles  of  Rich- 
mond, Ky. ,  Vioksburg  and  Jackson,  Miss.,  in  which 
latter  engagement  he  received  a  slight  wound.  He 
was  honorably  discharged  in  1864,  and  then  took  up 
the  work  of  the  ministry  in  the  Baptist  Church,  his 
field  of  labor  being  in  the  counties  of  Rush,  Shelby, 
Decatur,  Bartholomew  and  Brown.  He  retired  from 
the  regular  work  in  1883.  Since  1881  he  has  resided 
on  a  farm  in  Fayette  County. 

NATHANIEL  HAMILTON,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township.  This  venerable  gentleman  and  pioneer  of 
the  Whitewater  Valley  is  a  native  of  Pennsylvania, 
born  on  the  25th  of  May,  1798.  His  parents,  Na- 
thaniel and  Elizabeth  (Buchanan)  Hamilton,  were  na- 
tives of  Ireland  and  Pennsylvania,  respectively.  To 
them  were  born  twelve  children:  Nathaniel,  John, 
Polly,  George,  Mary  Ann,  Margaret,  Adam,  Isabelle, 
James,  Elizabeth,  Jane  and  Robert.  In  1810  Na- 
thaniel Hamilton,  Sr.,  with  his  family,  immigrated  to 
the  then  Territory  of  Indiana,  locating  in  what  is  now 
Franklin  County,  just  above  Brookville,  where  they 
remained  during  the  war  of  1812-14,  in  which  war 
two  of  the  sons,  John  and  Adam,  served.  In  1815, 
on  the  close  of  the  war,  the  family  moved  to  what  is 
now  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  settling  in  Connersville 
Township,  just  northwest  of    the   village.     Here  Mr. 


Hamilton  died  in  1823.  His  widow  died  about  1826, 
in  the  State  of  Illinois.  Both  were  members  of  the 
Presbyterian  Church,  in  which  he  was  an  Elder. 
Nathaniel  Hamilton,  Jr.,  resided  with  his  parents 
until  his  marriage,  in  1821,  with  Lueinda,  daughter 
of  James  and  Margaret  Tyner,  of  this  county.  To 
this  union  were  born:  Eliza  A.,  John,  Nathaniel,  Lu- 
einda,' James,  Margaret  Mary,  Washington  M.  and 
Elvira,  of  whom  the  five  last  named  are  deceased. 
In  1824  he  began  purchasing  from  the  other  heirs 
their  shares  of  the  estate,  and  soon  had  100  acres, 
upon  which  he  still  resides.  Mr.  Hamilton  was  mar- 
ried four  times,  and  has  outlived  all  his  chosen  com- 
panions. No  children  were  born  to  him  after  his  first 
marriage.  In  his  religious  views  our  subject  adheres 
to  the  doctrines  of  the  Old  School  Baptist  Church,  of 
which  church  he  has  been  a  regular  attendant  all  of 
his  life.  Old  "Natty"  Hamilton,  as  he  is  familiarly 
called,  is  agreeably  known  to  all  of  the  Whitewater 
country,  by  whom  he  is  highly  esteemed  as  a  citizen 
and  beloved  as  a  neighbor.  He  is  amiable  in  his 
manners,  and  is  remarkably  well  preserved  for  one  of 
his  age,  in  both  mind  and  body.

live  business  man,  a  keen  observer,  and  generous  in 
his  support  of  benevolent  and  other  enterprises  of 
public  interest. 

WILLIAM  HART  (deceased),  late  of  Waterloo 
Township,  was  born  in  New  York,  December  1,  1796, 
and  was  a  son  of  Henry  and  Ann  B.  Hart,  New  York- 
ers who  settled  in  Pennsylvania,  where  both  died. 
William,  at  the  age  of  twenty-one,  in  1817,  located 
in  Waterloo  Township,  this  county.  Here  he  was 
united  in  marriage  with  Sary,  daughter  of  Aaron  and 
Catharine  (Snoterly),  who  bore  him  two  children: 
David  and  Sarah.  Mr.  Hart  was  married  on  second 
occasion  to  Eliza  Jane  Cary,  by  whom  he  had  sixteen 
children,  viz.:  Catharine,  Elizabeth,  William  E., 
John  C. ,  Hannah  J.,  Barbara  A.,  Andrew  J.,  Malinda 
C,  George  W.,  Myra  E.,  Susan  F.,  William  H.,  Pris- 
cilla  A.,  Parmella  A.,  Martha  M.,  Mary  E.  Soon 
after  his  second  marriage  Mr.  Hart,  in  company 
with  Mr.  Cary,  went  to  Indianapolis,  then  a  village, 
where  they  had  a  contract  for  clearing  off  the  heavy 
timber  from  a  portion  of  the  land  on  which  the  city 
now  stands.  After  the  completion  of  this  contract, 
Mr.  Hart  settled  on  land  in  W  aterloo  Township, 
this  county,  where  he  died.  He  creditably  filled 
the  offices  of  Justice  of  the  Peace  and  Township 
Trustee.  Though  never  a  member  of  church,  he  was 
liberally  disposed  toward  it  and  freely  gave  to  its 
maintenance.  He  was  widely  and  well  known,  and 
respected  by  all  acquainted  with  him.  He  died  Sep- 
tember 4,  1861.  His  widow  is  still  living  and  is  a 
resident  of  Warren  County,  Iowa.  Madison  Aber- 
nathy,  deceased  husband  of  Susan  F.  (Hart)  Aber- 
nathy,  daughter  of  William  Hart,  was  born  on  the

temperate,  conscientious  and  liberal.  The  possessor 
of  a  good  intellect, with  retentive  memory,  he  remem- 
bered all  that  he  read,  which  made  him  a  pleasing 
and  instructive  companion.  Although  starting  in

HON.  MATTHEW  R.  HULL  (deceased)  was  born 
in  Taylor  County,  Va.,  December  1,  1809.  His 
father,  Jacob  Hull,  was  of  Qerman  extraction,  born 
July  4,  1776,  in  the  city  of  Philadelphia,  at  an  hour 
when  the  bell  of  Independence  was  ringing  out  a 
nation's  freedom.  Our  subject  came  to  Fayette 
County,  Ind.,  in   1828,    and  for  a  period  made  his 


home  at  the  house  of  an  uncle,  Matthew  Robinson,  for 
whom  he  was  named.  He  received  such  educational 
advantages  as  were  then  afibrded  to  ordinary  farmers' 
children,  and  for  a  time  was  engaged  in  teaching  in 
the  county.  He  early  learned  the  saddlery  trade, 
which  he  followed  at  different  points  in  the  county. 
On  the  29th  of  November,  1832,  he  was  married  to 
Miss  Sarah  A.  Hanson,  of  this  county,  and  to  them 
were  born:  Oscar  H.,  Justinian  H,  John  W. ,  Jane 
H.,  Matthew  R.,  Jr.,  and  Mahala  A.  (deceased).  Mrs. 
Hull  died  Octeber  5,  1855.  She  was  a  Wesleyan 
Methodist,  and  a  good  Christian  woman.  In  1832 
Mr.  Hull,  in  connection  with  C.  B.  Smith,  started  in 
Connersville  the  Indiana  Sentinel,  which  after  one 
year  Mr.  Hull  published  for  several  years  himself. 
He  subsequently  published  papers  in  Ohio,  all  of 
which  are  mentioned  as  having  spirited  editorials, 
and  being  true  to  the  principles  published.  "  He  was 
a  terse  and  vigorous  writer,  and  was  never  afraid  of 
opposition.  The  truth  as  he  understood  it  was  sure 
to  come,  let  it  fall  where  it  would. "  He  was  a  man  of 
more  than  ordinary  talents,  and  but  for  his  instability 
he  would  have  gone  into  the  National  Congress.  He 
always  occupied  ground  in  advance  of  most  men  of 
his  day  in  all  matters  of  reform.  He  was  an  Aboli- 
tionist when  it  cost  something  to  speak  in  favor  of  the 
colored  man.  He  was  a  temperance  reformer  whea 
there  was  no  popularity  in  the  movement.  These 
facts  are  mentioned  in  palliation  of  his  instability. 
When  the  masses  came  to  his  views  he  would  move 
forward  and  still  occupy  ground  far  in  advance.  He 
was  a  generous  man;  he  never  saw  the  day  when  the 
last  meal  would  not  have  been  divided  with  the  needy. 
In  religion  he  was  a  humanitarian."  Mr.  Hull,  in 
1839,  was  chosen  a  Representative  from  this  county, 
in  the  State  Legislature,  having  for  his  colleague 
Samuel  W.  Parker.  He  took  great  interest  in  matters 
pertaining  to  agriculture,  and  was  instrumental  in 
improving  the  stock  of  the  county.  His  death 
occurred  July  12,  1875;  his  widow  still  survives.  In 
later  life  Matthew  R.  Hull  was  identified  with  the 
Democratic  party.  John  W.,  the  third  son,  is  a  resi- 
dent of  the  county,  living  at  Alquina,  at  which  village 
be  was  born,  July  23,  1839.  In  1863  he  married 
Maria,  daughter  of  John  J.  Burk,  and  to  this  union 
have  been  born  nine  childi'en,  eight  of  whom  are  now 
living.

he  died.  Benjamin  never  returned  and  is  now  sup- 
posed to  be  also  among  the  dead.  At  his  father's 
death,  in  1838,  Mr.  John  inherited  his  present  farm 
of  eighty  acres  from  the  latler's  estate,  and  on  this 
farm  he  has  since  resided,  following  the  pursuit  of 
agriculture.  He  is  one  of  the  oldest  settlers  of  Fay- 
ette County,  the  interests  of  which  he  has  labored  for 
sixty-eight  years  to  sustain,  and  one  of  the  few  who 
lent  the  vigor  of  their  young  lives  for  the  county's 
development. 

GREENUP  JOHN,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship, was  born  in  Kentucky,  June  10,  1810.  He  is  a 
son  of  Jonathan  John,  a  notice  of  whom  is  given  in 
the  township  history  proper.  He  came  to  this  town- 
ship with  his  parents  in  1816,  and  has  since  resided 
here.  In  January,  1836,  he  married  Jeannette, 
daughter  of  James  and  Sallie  Bowers,  and  with  this 
estimable  wife  he  shared  the  fortunes  of  life  till  her 
death  in  June,  1874.  In  1836  Mr.  John  purchased 
120  acres  of  land  which  by  hard  labor  he  has  culti- 
vated and  improved  and  on  which  he  still  lives.  He 
has  two  children  living:  Wesley  and  Edward.  The 
deceased  are  Mahala  and  Henry.  Mr.  John  is  one  of 
the  oldest  settlers  of  the  county,  and  his  life  has  been 
one  of  toil.  He  has  always  been  a  farmer,  a  man 
highly  esteemed  in  his  community  as  a  man  of  honor 
and  integrity.

WILLIAM  C.  JONES  (deceased)  late  of  Waterloo 
Township,  was  born  in  Maryland,  February  2,  1806. 
He  was  left  an  orphan  at  an  early  age,  thrown  entirely 
upon  his  own  resources.     In  1821,  alone,  be  started 


for  the  West,  walking  the  greater  part  of  the  distance, 
and  located  in  Fayette  County,  Ind.  He  worked  by  the

opened  for  himself  a  shop  in  Waterloo.  For  three 
years  he  followed  his  trade,  laying  up  enough 
money  to  buy  a  small  home,  which  brought  him  forty 
acres  of  laud,  and  he  then  combined  farming  with 
blacksmithing.  After  this  he  bought  1 10  acres,  which 
became  the  homestead  now  owned  by  H.  L.  Jones, 
his  son.  Here  he  lived  during  the  balance  of  his 
natiural  life.  He  was  a  self-made  man  in  every  sense 
of  the  word.  By  his  untiring  energy,  indomitable 
will  and  great  decision  of  character  he  overcame  the 
obstacles  of  life  and  acquired  the  distinction  of 
becomincr  a  leading  and  influential  citizen.  He  was 
an  upright,  honest  man,  and  all  who  knew  him  re- 
spected him  for  his  many  excellent  traits  of  character. 
He  married  Mary  Williams,  who  bore  him  eight  chil 
dren  :  Lucinda,  H.  L.,  J.  B.,  Emma,  Rebecca,  J. 
K.,  Eliza  and  Sarah.  Mr.  Jones  was  a  consistent 
member  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  with 
which  he  was  connected  the  greater  portion  of  his  life. 
He  was  one  of  the  organizing  members  of  the  Robin- 
son Chapel,  and  the  contractor  of  the  church  building 
erected  in  1845.  His  wife  was  a  member  of  the 
same  church,  and  like  her  husband  took  an  active 
part,  which  only  ended  with  her  life.  Mr.  Jones 
died  August?,  1881;  his  widow  January  7,  1882,  aged 
seventy- four  years.

2,  1851,  he  married  Catherine,  born  in  Fayette 
County,  1831,  daughter  of  Benjamin  and  Hannah

the  township,  if  not  in  the  county.  He  and  his 
estimable  wife  are  consistent  members  of  the  Meth-

his  parents  to  this  county  in  1816,  where  he  was  mar- 
ried November  17,  1831,  to  Matilda,  daughter  of

for  three  years,  and  then  purchased  and  moved  on 
the  farm  where  he  has  since  resided.  He  was  again 
married  in  this  county,  August  12,  1849,  on  second 
occasion  to  Auis,  daughter  of  James  and  Anna  (Mar- 
tin) Trousler,  and  who  was  born  in  this  county,  Feb- 
ruary 10,  1821.  To  this  union  were  born  seven

IRA  L.  KELLOGG,  machinist,  Posey  Township, 
was  born  in  Posey  Township,  this  county,  October  3, 
1843.  He  was  reared  on  a  farm  and  received  a  good 
common  school  education.  In  1871  he  engaged  in 
the  saw-mill  business  at  Bentonville,  for  five  years;

SAMUEL  J.  KEMMER,  farmer,  Posey  Township, 
was  born  in  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  in  1823;  son  of 
John  Kemmer,  who  was  a  son  of  Nicholas  and  Sarah 
(Pholer)  Kemmer.  Nicholas  was  born  in  Germany 
and  emigrated  to  this  country  previous  to  the  Revo- 
lutionary war,  when  eighteen  years  old.  He  was  one 
of  the  band  of  men  disguised  as  Indiana  who  boarded 
the  English  vessels  lying  in  Boston  Harbor  and  threw 
overboard  the  tea  that  had  been  refused  a  landing. 
He  served  during  the  war  that  followed,  doing  his 
adopted  country  signal  service.  He  was  at  Yorktown 
when  Gen.  Cornwallis  surrendered,  and  saw  the  two 
Generals  in  conversation  after  the  capitulation. 
After  the  close  of  the  war  he  settled  in  Lancaster 
County,  Penn.,  where  he  married,  after  which  event  he 
removed  to  Kentucky,  and  in  1833  settled  in  Posey 
Township,  where  he  died  in  1839.  He  had  eight 
children,  two  of  whom  are  now  living:  Daniel  and 
Samuel.  John  Kemmer  was  married  in  1820  to 
Sarah  Overturf,  and  their  children  were:  Mary  Ann, 
Matilda  Jane,  Samuel  J.,  Melvina,  Sarah,  Mehetabel, 
Sanford,  Harvey  and  Lewis.  In  1831  Mr.  Kemmer 
left  Kentucky  and  settled  in  Posey  Township,  where 
he  died  August  29,  1864.  He  was  rather  above  the 
average  of  men — a  favorite  with  his  fellows,  unosten- 
tatious in  manner,  honest  in  his  dealings,  and  withal 
an  excellent  citizen — a  kind  and  affectionate  husband 
and  father.  His  widow  was  born  in  Kentucky,  in 
1802.  She  is  yet  living,  vigorous  in  mind  and  body. 
The  subject  of  this  sketch  is  a  lover  of  good  books, 
and  has  the  best  farmer's  library  in  the  county.  He 
is  a  member  of  the  I.  O.  O.  F.,  Subordinate  and 
Encampment.  He  owns  275  acres  of  land,  all  under 
cultivation  and  well  improved,  one  of  the  best  farms 
in  Posey  Township.  Samuel  J.  Kemmer  has  been 
twice  married,  the  first  time,  January  13,  1849,  to 
Elizabeth  Campbell,  by  whom  he  had  five  children: 
Sarah  J.,  Luzena  A.,  Elizabeth  E.,  Mary  F.  and

Kemmer,  of  whom  mention  is  made  in  the  sketch  of 
Samuel  J.  Kemmer.  He  was  born  in  1832,  where 
he  now  lives  with  his  aged  mother.

in  the  sketch  of  Samuel  J.  Kemmer.  He  was  born 
in  this  county  and  township  November  13,  1839,  and 
was  here  married  April  14,  1861,  to  Sarah  J.,  daugh- 
ter of  Levi  and  Susan  Ayers,  of  this  township,  and 
born  in  this  county  March  31,  1837.  They  have  two 
children — Virginia  and  Claronettie.  After  his  mar- 
riage Mr.  Kemmer  settled  on  his  brother's  farm  in 
Posey  Township,  Fayette  County,  where  he  remained 
about  nine  years,  and  thence  moved  on  an  adjoining 
farm  and  remained  aboiat  fourteen  years.  In  1875 
he  purchased  his  present  farm,  and  in  1883  erected  a 
fine  house,  where  he  has  since  resided. 

DANIEL  KERSCHNER,  farmer  and  inventor, 
Harrison  Township,  was  born  in  Harrison  Township, 
Fayette  County,  Ind. ,  July  24,  1846,  a  son  of  Dan- 
iel Kerschner,  who  was  born  in  Berks  County,  Penn., 
and  emigrated  to  Indiana  in  1833.  He  died  August 
23,  1860.  Our  subject  acquired  a  common  school 
education.  He  was  married  December  18,  1873,  to 
Miss  Ella  R.  Scofield,  also  of  Fayette  County,  Ind., 
who  bore  him  four  children:  Irene  (died  September 
23,  1875),  Daniel  F.,  Clara  M.  and  Ina  L.  Mr. 
Kerschner  has  been  engaged  in  farming  nearly  all  his 
life.  He  is  an  inventive  genius  and  has  produced 
two  useful  patents,  viz.,  horse  corn  drill  and  corn  cul- 
tivator. 

DANIEL  KLINE  (deceased),  late  of  Waterloo 
Township,  was  born  in  Chester  County,  Penn., 
about  the  year  1791;  son  of  Isaac  Kline,  who  was  de- 
scended from  German  stock.  The  subject  of  this  sketch 
was  reared  in  Pennsylvania,  where  he  was  married  to 
Catherine  Weichey.  When  two  children — Isaac  and 
Henry — had  been  born  to  them,  they  removed,  in 
1825,  by  team  and  wagon,  to  Waterloo  Township, 
this  county,  where  Mr.  Kline  purchased  the  quarter 
section  now  owned  by  his  son  Benjamin,  and  after 
that  eight  children  were  born  to  them:  Mary,  John, 
Abraham  and  Benjamin  (twins),  Daniel,  Samuel, 
William  and  John.  Here  our  subject  lived  many 
years  and  prospered,  having  added  enough  to  the 
scant  means  he  brought  to  make  himself  independent 
of  the  ordinary  demands  of  the  world.  He  died  in 
Huntington  County,  Ind.,  May  27,  1873.  He  was  an 
exemplary  member  of  the  German  Baptist  Church, 
though  previously  he  held  membership  in  the  Chris- 
tian Church,  of  which  his  wife  was  a  devoted  mem- 
ber. She  died  October  6,  1862,  aged  sixty-two  years. 
Benjamin  Kline  is  the  only  representative  of  the 
family  in  Fayette  County;  born  January  1,  1834.  He 
was  reared  on  the  farm  where  he  was  born  and  on 
which  he  has  always  lived.  He  now  owns  the  old 
homestead,  which  is  complete  in  its  original  condition. 

MATT.  T.  LAIR,  farmer,  Jennings  Township, 
was  born  on  the  old  homestead  in  Fayette  County,  in 
1832,  son  of  William  Lair,  who  was   born   in  Rock- 


ingham County,  Va. ,  July  7,  1784.  When  the  latter 
was  but  a  child  his  father,  Matthias  Lair,  also  a  Vir- 
ginian, and  a  soldier  in  the  Revolutionary  war,  set- 
tled in  what  is  now  Harrison  County,  Ky.,  where  he 
died.  William'  Lair  was  first  married  in  Kentucky 
to  Rachel,  daughter  of  Samuel  and  Sarah  Bell.  His 
second  wife,  Emily  Bell,  born  in  the  year  1804,  was 
a  sister  of  his  first  wife,  and  the  mother  of  his  chil- 
dren, twelve  in  number,  viz. :  Samuel  (deceased), 
Sarah  (deceased),  Joseph,  Rachel,  Matthias,  Harriet 
(deceased),  Adeline.  Charles,  Osa  (deceased),  Sophia, 
John  and  Jennie.  Mr.  Lair  served  in  the  war  of 
1812-15,  and  was  in  the  battle  of  the  Thames, 
Canada,  and  after  the  tight  saw  the  lifeless  body  of 
the  famous  Indian  chief,  Tecumseh.  Before  going 
into  service  he  had  followed  boating  on  the  Ohio  and 
Mississippi  Rivers  and  their  tributaries,  making  fre- 
quent trips  to  New  Orleans,  returning  on  foot  through 
a  wilderness  where  the  houses  were  frequently  many 
miles  apart.  Once,  in  the  early  history  of  steam  nav- 
igation, he  attempted  an  up- trip  in  a  steamboat,  but 
its  progress  was  so  slow  he  abandoned  it  and  took  to 
the  woods  on  foot,  and  beat  the  vessel  to  Louisville. 
After  the  close  of  the  war  of  1812  he  removed  to  In- 
diana, then  a  Territory,  and  settled  where  S.  H.  Hel- 
vie,  his  son-in-law,  now  lives,  entering  at  the  time 
160  acres  of  land,  upon  which  the  rest  of  his  natural 
life  was  passed.  When  he  began  in  life  he  had  only 
sufficient  moans  to  secure  his  land,  but  being  indus- 
trious and  a  good  manager,  he  steadily  increased  his 
accumulations,  which  at  his  death  aggregated  $35,- 
000.  Though  small  in  stature,  he  was  symmetrically 
built,  muscular,  and  capable  of  enduring,  with  but 
little  fatigue,  the  heavy  burdens  that  devolved  upon 
him.  Politically  he  was  a  Whig  of  strong  anti -slavery 
principles.  Before  leaving  Kentucky  he  gave  free- 
dom to  two  slaves.  He  held  the  office  of  Township

to  this  county  and  found  little  else  than  forests,  wild 
animals  and  Indians.  He  entered  land  on  which  his 
only  surviving  daughter,  Nancy,  now  lives,  and  where

E.  D.  McCONNELL,  farmer,  Fairview  Township, 
was  born  in  Brown  County,  Ohio,  February  19,  1802. 
His  parents,  Thomas  and  Marj'  (Downing)  McConnell,

ively. Thomas  McConnell  was  a  son  of  Arthur 
McConnell,  a  native  of  Ireland,  who  there  married 
Elizabeth  Wilson,  and  who,  previous  to  the  Revolu- 
tionary war,  emigrated  to  the  United  States,  settling 
in  western  Pennsylvania,  whore  he  remained  until 
death.  He  was  the  father  of  nine  children:  Sarah, 
Susan,  Mai'garet,  Mary,  George,  Arthur,  James,  John

the  farm  where  he  now  lives.  Mrs.  E.  D.  McConnell 
died  May  30,  1882.  Our  subject  has  always  taken  an 
active  interest  in  religious  matters,  having  been  iden- 
tified with  the  Christian  Church  for  forty  years.  In 
polities  he  is  a  Republican.  He  cast  his  first  Presi- 
dential vote  for  Henry  Clay,  voting  the  Whig  ticket 
without  change  until  the  organization  of  the  Repub- 
lican party,  since  when  he  has  ever  been  an  uncom- 
promising and  zealous  supporter  of  Republican 
principles.  He  started  in  life  a  poor  boy,  but  by 
industry,  close  application  to  business,  and  a  judicious 
use  of  his  time,  he  has  accomplished  at  least  one  of 
the  great  objects  of  life,  having  secured  a  good  home 
and  living  in  the  full  enjoyment  of  every  comfort.

member  of  the  Christian  Church;  in  politics  he  is  a 
Republican.  He  is  one  of  the  few  pioneers  left  to 
recite  to  us  the  tale  of  privations  of  pioneer  life  in 
the  by-gone  days  of  nearly  three-quarters  of  a  cen- 
tury.

Township,  is  perhaps  the  oldest  person  of  her  sex  now 
living;  in  the  county,  having  been  born  in  Hunting- 
don County,  Penn.,  May  24,  1795.  Her  parents, 
Hugh  and  Margaret  (Buchanan)  Morrison,  were  na- 
tives of  Ireland  and  Maryland  respectively.  They 
resided  several  years  in  Maryland  and  Pennsylvania, 
and  came  from  the  latter  State  to  Brookville,Ind., about 
1809,  moving  to  this  county  about  five  years  later,  but 
returning  to  Brookville  in  about  eighteen  months 
thereafter.  In  1820  Mr.  Morrison  died,  and  his  widow 
then  took  up  her  residence  with  her  daughter  in  this 
county,  where  she  died  in  1833.  Mrs.  Marshall  spent 
the  first  twenty-one  years  of  her  life  with  her  parents. 
She  was  married,  March  27,  1817,  to  James  F.  Mar- 
shall, who  was  born  in  Washington  County,  Va., 
March  27,  1785.  He  came  to  this  State  in  1814,  and 
located  in  this  township,  where  ho  resided  until  his 
death  in  1852.  He  was  always  a  farmer,  very  indus- 
trious, and  did  much  to  develop  this  then  unbroken 
forest.  He  was  a  man  of  strong  constitution,  firm 
convictions,  and  an  unswerving  Democrat  in  politics. 
He  first  purchased  400  acres  of  land,  and  subsequently 
dealt  quite  extensively  in  real  estate.  After  her 
marriage  Mrs.  Marshall  moved  at  once  to  this  local- 
ity, and  about  two  years  later  to  the  farm  on  which 
she  has  resided  up  to  the  present  time,  a  period  of 
nearly  sixty-five  years.  She  is  the  mother  of  ten  chil- 
dren, six  of  whom  are  now  living,  viz. :  Kobert, 
Andrew,  Esther,  James  D.,  William  and  Sarah  J. 
The  deceased  are  Sarah  J.,  Isabel,  Hugh  and 
Joseph.  The  last-mentioned  was  a  Captain  in  the 
Regular  Army,  and  died  at  Fort  Rice,  Dak.  T. ,  Sep- 
tember 15,  1867.  Mrs.  Marshall  is  one  of  the  few 
who  are  still  left  to  see  the  seat  of  their  early  toil 
and  trials  teeming  with  the  fruits  of  improved  indus- 
try and  civilization.  The  Indians,  whom  she  was  ac- 
customed to  see  in  large  numbers,  have  gone  to  seek 
homes  in  the  forests  of  the  West,  and  their  old  hunt- 
ing grounds  are  transformed  into  fields  of  waving 
grain.  Mrs.  Marshall  is  a  member  of  the  Presbyte- 
rian Church.  She  is  well  preserved  in  body  and 
mind,  and  her  memory  will  be  ever  kindly  cherished 
by  all  who  know  her. 

JAMES  D.  MARSHALL,  Connersville  Township, 
son  of  James  F.  and  Margaret  Marshall,  was  born  in 
1830,  on  the  farm  where  he  now  resides.  He  here 
grew  to  manhood,  and  in  1876  was  married  to  Fran- 
ces Rohe,  a  native  of  Fayette  County,  and  daughter  of 
Andrew  Rohe.  She  died  childless  in  April,  1882. 
Mr.  Marshall  and  his  sister,  Sarah  J.,  are  now  taking 
care  of  their  mother,  who  depends  upon  them  for 
support,  and  Mr.  Marshall  has  charge  of  the  undivid- 
ed estate  of  eighty-two  acres,  on  which  he  conducts  a 
general  and  very  successful  farming  business. 

GEORGE  MARTIN,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 


ship, is  another  of  the  substantial  farmers  of  Fayette 
County  who  have  carved  homes  from  the  hard  rocks  of 
circumstance.  He  was  born  in  Franklin  County, 
Ind. ,  in  1817,  and  is  a  son  of  George  Martin,  Sr., 
who  came  from  Soilth  Carolina  in  1808.  His  mother, 
Mrs.  Jane  (^Smith)  Martin,  was  a  native  of  Old  Vir- 
ginia. Our  subject  grew  to  fourteen  years  of  age  in 
his  native  county.  He  then  moved  with  his  parents 
to  this  county,  where  they  resided  twenty-eight  years, 
and  then  moved  to  Wabash  County,  where  the  mother 
died  about  1867,  the  father  in  1871.  At  the  age  of 
twenty-two  Mr.  Martin  began  operations  on  his  own 
resources.  He  was  married,  in  1839,  to  Elizabeth 
Hamilton,  who  was  born  and  reared  in  this  county, 
daughter  of  George  Hamilton,  one  of  the  first  settlers 
of  this  locality.  After  his  marriage  he  rented  land 
one  year  and  then  purchased  eighty  acres  of  his 
father.  About  ten  years  later  he  sold  out  and  moved 
to  Wabash  County,  where  he  purchased  320  acres, 
which  he  sold  six  months  afterward.  In  March, 
1851,  he  piirchased  his  present  farm  of  168  acres,  on 
which  he  has  since  resided.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Martin 
have  six  children  living:  Rebecca  A.  (now  Mrs. 
Springer),  Nancy  J.  (now  Mrs.  Scott),  Francis  M. , 
George  M.,  Mary  A.  (now  Mrs.  Sharp)  and  Charles  M. 
The  deceased  are:  Oliver,  Silas  M. ,  Helen  C.  and 
Elizabeth.  Mi-.  Martin  has  always  devoted  his  atten- 
tion to  farming  and  stock  raising,  and  by  industry 
and  economy  has  obtained  a  handsome  competency, 
although  having  lost  heavily  by  securities  for  friends. 
He  is  a  Republican  of  the  old  Whig  persuasion,  and 
is  held  in  high  esteem  as  a  citizen. 

GEORGE  M.  MARTIN,  Connersville  Township, 
one  of  the  enterprising  young  farmers  of  this 
county,  was  born  in  Connersville  Township,  this 
county,  March  4,  1853.  He  is  a  son  of  George 
Martin,  whose  sketch  appears  above,  and  with 
whom  our  subject  spent  his  early  days  on  the 
farm  in  this  township,  receiving  his  education 
in  the  district  schools.  After  his  twentieth  year 
Mr.  Martin  began  operations  on  the  "Iron  High-

moved  to  the  farm  on  which  he  resides,  a  part  of 
which  he  purchased  and  a  part  inherited  by  Mrs. 
Martin.  Here  he  has  since  been  successfully  engaged 
in  farming  and  stock-raising.  He  is  a  progressive 
farmer  and  highly  esteemed  as  a  citizen. 

HON.  MINOR  MEEKER  (deceased),  late  of  Har- 
rison Township.  This  prominent  pioneer  settler  and 
citizen  of  distinction  was  a  native  of  Orange  County, 
N.  Y. ,  born  July  5,  1 795,  and  at  the  age  of  two  years 
was  left  in  the  world  without  parents.  When  ten 
years  old  he  went  to  Seneca  County,  same  State;  in 
his  eighteenth  year  he  was  drafted  into  the  United 
States'  service,  and  in  the  fall  of  1813  shouldered  his 
gun  and  marched  to  Niagara  under  the  command  of 
Col.  Swift,  an  officer  who  had  served  in  the  Revolu- 
tionary war.  Young  Meeker  was  honorably  dis- 
charged after  three  months'  service,  when  he  went  to 
Steuben  County,  and  there  learned  the  tanning  bus- 
iness, with  Allen  Boardman.  After  completing  his 
trade  he  was  for  a  period  engaged  as  pilot  on  boats 
in  the  lumber  trade  between  Elmira,  N.  Y.,  and  Har- 
risburg,  Penn.,  the  distance  being  150  miles,  which 
he  walked  on  return  trips,  and  at  one  time  made  the 
journey  in  three  days.  In  1819,  in  company  with 
Elder  Minor  Thomas  and  others,  Mr.  Meeker  started 
for  the  West,  going  by  way  of  Olean  on  the  Allegany 
River,  thence  by  flat-boat,  to  a  point  some  five  miles 
above  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  where  they  remained  until 
July,  when  they  made  their  way  to  Fayette  County, 
Ind.,  and  here  Mr.  Meeker  located  permanently.  Our 
subject  acted  as  pilot  on  the  voyage,  which  was  of 
nine  days'  length.  On  his  arrival  in  Connersville  he 
engaged  in  the  tanning  business  for  a  time  for  a  Mr. 
Rees.  January  15,  1820,  he  was  married  to  Rachel, 
daughter  of  Elder  Minor  Thomas,  and  born  in  Tomp- 
kins County,  N.  Y.,  April  21,  1799.  To  this  mar- 
riage were  born  in  this  county,  Marcella  and  Ches- 
ter C,  the  former  October  28,  1823,  the  latter  July 
27,  1828.  After  his  marriage  Mr.  Meeker  for  a  time 
resided  on  the  farm  with  his  father-in-law;  subse- 
quently he  purchased  eighty  acres  of  land  on  Will- 
.iams  Creek,  in  Harrison  Township,  on  which  he 
reared  a  cabin  home,  and  where  he  lived  the  rest  of 
his  days.  He  died  May  10, 18G5;  his  widow  died  March 
1,  1881.  Besides  being  occupied  as  a  farmer,  Mr. 
Meeker  operated  a  tan-yard  on  his  place  for  a  time, 
and  with  it  conducted  a  boot  and  shoe  business.  For 
many  years  he  was  engaged  extensively  in  the  pork 
trade,  in  connection  with  several  large  firms  operating 


in  that  line  in  Connersville.  He  was  for  a  time  one  of 
the  directors  of  the  old  Canal  Company,  and  always  took 
an  active  part  in  all  the  early  public  improvements  of 
the  county.  He  was  elected  to  and  served  three  terms 
in  the  State  Legislature,  and  two  terms  in  the  Senate. 
He  was  never  defeated  for  ofiice.  He  was  a  member 
of  the  Second  Baptist  Church,  Williams  Creek.  Ches- 
ter C,  son  of  our  subject,  is  an  affable  and  courteous 
gentleman,  one  of  the  substantial  citizens  of  the  county. 
His  first  wife  was  Susan  A.  Budd,  whom  he  man-ied 
in  1851;  she  died  in  1852.  In  1856  he  next  married 
Ann  J.  Johnson,  and  to  this  union  have  been  born  six 
children. 

JAMES  M.  MILNER,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  is  a  native  of  this  county,  still  residing  on 
the  farm  where  he  was  born  January  10,  1830.  His 
parents,  John  and  Nancy  (Miranda)  Milner,  were 
married  in  1806  and  came  to  this  locality  when  it  was 
yet  a  wilderness,  inhabited  only  by  savages  and  wild 
beasts.  There  were  eleven  children  in  the  family,  all 
of  whom  grew  to  maturity,  five  now  living:  William; 
Jemima,  wife  of  Matthew  Harlan;  Malinda,  vpife  of 
Achilles  Backhouse;  Nancy,  wife  of  Samuel  Back- 
house, and  James  M.,  who  is  the  youngest  of  the 
family.  The  father  purchased  328  acres  of  land,  and 
died  on  the  farm  now  owned  by  his  son  James  M , 
March  22,  1856;  his  widow  survived  till  February  6, 
1873.  James  M.  Milner  resided  here  with  his  parents 
till  twenty-one  years  of  age.  He  was  married  April 
14,  1850,  to  Melissa  A.  Stoops,  daughter  of  Robert 
Stoops,  of  Franklin  County,  and  six  children  were 
born  to  this  union:  Martha,  Nancy,  George,  Mary, 
Charles  and  Walter.  Martha  and  Mary  are  deceased. 
The  mother  also  passed  away  August  8,  1882.  After 
his  marriage  Mr.  Milner  continued  his  operations  on 
the  farm  of  which  his  father  gave  him  a  deed  of  sixty 
acres,  and  to  which,  still  later,  he  added  his  mother's 
interest.  He  now  has  114  acres  of  valuable  land. 
He  has  been  generally  successful,  but  has  met  with 
some  reverses.  Our  subject  is  a  Democrat  and  strong 
in  the  faith  of  his  party.  Death  has  broken  the  fam- 
ily band,  and  this  has  forever  saddened  what  would 
otherwise  be  a  happy  family. 

JOSEPH  MINOR,  farmer,  Connersville  Township, 
is  a  native  of  Connersville  Township,  this  county, 
born  on  the  farm  where  he  now  resides,  July  29, 1821, 
son  of  Joseph  Minor,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  and 
Rebecca  (Smith)  Minor,  a  native  of  Kentucky.  His 
parents  moved  to  Mr.  Minor's  present  farm  as  early 
as  1812,  and  the  family  has  since  been  one  of  the 
thriftiest  in  this  county.  There  were  seven  children, 
six  of  whom  are  now  living:  Alexander,  Joseph 
Noah,  Samuel,  Frank  J.  and  Rebecca.  A  daughter, 
Ann,  is  deceased.  The  father  died  in  April,  1858; 
the  mother  on  Christmas  Day,  1875.      Our  subject

resided  on  the  farm  with  his  parents  till  their  death, 
when  he  inherited  the  homestead  of  160  acres  and  on 
this  farm  he  has  since  been  engaged  in  dealing  in 
and  raising  stock,  and  in  general  agriculture.  He 
has  done  considerable  shipping  and  has  always  been 
alive  to  every  interest  for  the  general  development  of 
his  farm  as  well  as  the  county's  resources.  About 
1875-77  he  became  a  member  of  the  firm  of  Smith, 
Minor  &amp;  McCormick,  and  assisted  in  establishing  a 
fertilizing  factory,  purchasing  the  interest  of  the 
other  members  later,  and  assuming  full  control,  which 
he  yet  retains.  In  1880,  in  company  with  Samuel 
Doll,  of  Centreville,  Mr.  Minor  erected  a  large  ice 
house  on  the  west  fork  of  the  Whitewater  River,  and 
has  since  given  some  attention  to  the  ice  business. 
He  was  married  in  1861  to  Sarah  Jackman,  a  native 
of  Adams  County,  Ohio,  and  daughter  of  Hiram 
Jackman.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Minor  are  members  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  and  are  highly  esteemed 
as  citizens  and  neighbors. 

ANDREW  MOFFITT,  farmer,  Fairview  Town- 
ship, was  born  in  Cumberland  County,  Penn.,  Sep- 
tember 15,  1809.  His  parents,  natives  of  Ireland, 
immigrated  to  the  United  States  previous  to  the 
Revolutionary  war,  settling  in  Cumberland  County, 
Penn.,  where  the  father  died.  The  mother  subse- 
quently moved,  with  her  family,  to  Ohio,  and  in 
1822  came  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  settling  on  the 
farm  where  our  subject  now  lives,  and  where  she 
remained  until  her  death.  Her  family  was  as  follows: 
Thomas,  Robert,  Jane,  John,  Margaret,  William  and 
Andrew.  Our  subject,  who  is  next  to  the  youngest  in 
the  family,  left  Pennsylvania  in  1821,  and  came  to 
Ohio  on  foot;  shortly  afterward  he  walked  through  to 
this  county,  reaching  here  in  May,  1822.  He  worked 
at  different  occupations,  and  when  about  nineteen 
years  of  age  was  employed  by  one  of  his  neighbors 
at  25  cents  per  day,  until  he  had  $6.50  in  cash.  He 
then  walked  to  Cincinnati  (in  company  with  John 
Scott  and  Sam  McCory),  where  he  took  a  steam- boat 
to  Maysville,  Ky.,  and  there  hired  oat  on  a  keel-boat 
belonging  to  Armstrong,  Grant  &amp;  Co.,  at  50  cents  per 
day,  working  for  them  about  nine  months  and  saving 
$100  of  his  wages.  He  then  came  home  and  entered 
eighty  acres  of  land  in  Fairview  Township,  at  11.25 
per  acre.  The  following  spring  Mr.  Moffitt  went  to 
Charleston,  Va. ,  and  worked  six  summers  in  the 
salt  works,  between  the  Kanawha  Licks  and  the 
mouth  of  the  Cumberland  River.  He  then  returned 
home,  and  March  30,  1830,  married  Miss  Athaliah, 
eldest  daughter  of  John  and  Nancy  Rees,  and  who 
was  born  in  Greene  County,  Penn.,  June  28,  1816. 
To  this  union  were  born  ten  children:  John  R. ,  Nancy 
J.,  Amanda,  Alvira,  Hiram,  Lovica,  Alice,  Sardena, 
Greenberry  and  one  that  died  in  infancy.     Mr.  Mof- 


fitt, after  marriage,  rented  a  farm,  raised  one  crop 
and  in  that  fall  moved  to  Connersville,  Ind.,  and 
engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  linseed  oil  for  about 
six  months.  He  subsequently  moved  on  a  farm 
where  he  resided  over  a  year;  then  bought  eighty 
acres  of  land  from  John  Rees,  where  he  resided  about 
two  years;  then  purchased  and  moved  on  the  farm 
where  he  now  lives.  He  lost  his  wife  by  death  Feb- 
ruary 20,  1879.  Mr.  Mofiitt  has  been  a  member  of 
the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  for  nearly  forty 
years;  has  been  identified  with  the  interests  of  the 
county,  filling  a  number  of  its  minor  oflSces.  Though 
he  himself  received  but  a  limited  education,  he  has 
ever  been  interested  in  educational  matters.  He,  like 
most  of  the  hardy  yeomen  of  the  Western  country, 
began  life  a  poor  boy,  but  by  hard  work  and  economy 
he  has  accumulated  considerable  estate,  and  is  a  re- 
spected citizen.  He  cast  his  first  vote  for  Adams  and 
voted  with  the  Whig  party  until  its  dissolution,  and 
since  with  the  Republicans.

EDMUND  K.  MUNGER  (deceased)  was  born  in 
Rutland  County,  Vt.,  September  13. 1790;  is  the  third 
child  of  Gen.  Edmund  and  Eunice  (Kellogg)  Mun- 
ger,  who  were  born  in  Connecticut,  the  former  Sep- 
tember 30,  1763,  and  the  latter  August  13,  1767. 
They  were  married  December  5,  1785,  and  located 
at  Washington,  Conn.,  where  they  resided  but  a  few 
years;  went  thence  to  Rutland  County,  Vt.,  where 
they  remained  until  in  the  spring  of  1798,  when  they 
came  to  Belpre,  Washington  County,  Ohio.  He 
purchased  a  tract  of  land  in  Montgomery  County, 
and  in  the  spring  of  1799  he  descended  the  Ohio 
River  in  a  flat-boat,  landing  at  Cincinnati,  and  thence 
went  to  his  land  in  Montgomery  County,  reaching 
their  final  destination  in  May,  and  at  once  proceeded 
to  the  work  of  clearing  away  the  forest.  His  first 
house  consisted  of  some  bark  placed  over  them  by  the 
side  of  a  big  log,  where  they  lived  until  he,  with  the 
aid  of  a  few  others,  erected  a  little  log  hut,  which  in 
those  days  was  thought  to  be  a  very  fine  house.  He 
was  a  hard-working,  energetic  man,  and  became 
wealthy.  Gen.  Munger  was  of  Puritan  extraction. 
He  being  one  of  the  first  settlers  of  the  county,  well 
understood  the  disadvantages  and  inconveniences  of 
pioneer  life.  Gen.  Munger  and  his  wife  were  devoted 
and  exemplary  members  of  the  Presbyterian  Church. 
He  took  an  active  and  prominent  part  in  matters  of 
religion  and  in  all  the  public  interests  of  the  com- 
munity in  which  he  lived.  He  was  for  a  time  a  mem- 
ber of  the  State  Legislature.  He  was  commissioned 
a  Brigadier-General  during  the  war  of  1812-14,  hav- 
ing raised  a  command,  which  he  disciplined,  and  was 
afterward  superceded  by  Gen.  Hull,  much  to  the  dis- 
gust of  the  troops,  who  were  afterward  surrendered 
to  the  British  at  Detroit.  Gen.  Munger  resided  on 
his  farm  in  Montgomery  County  until  his  death, 
which  occurred  April  14,  1850.  He  was  then  a  stout 
man  for  his  advanced  age,  and  would  probably  have 
lasted  several  years  longer  had  not  his  death  been 
hastened  by  a  fall  from  a  ladder  in  his  barn.  His 
widow  survived  him  a  number  of  years,  and  died 
January  8,  1868,  at  the  remarkable  age  of  one  hun- 
dred years  and  nearly  five  months.  Twelve  children 
were  born  to  them,  three  now  living:  Reuben,  Festus 
E.  and  Isaac  N.     The  deceased  were  named:    War-

was  born  February  28,  1787,  at  Washington,  Conn. 
He  resided  with  his  parents  until  1811,  when  he  re 
turned   to  his  native  State,  where,  at  Litchfield,  he 
attended    law   school.     After  graduating  at  the  law 
school  he  returned  to   Ohio   and   began  the  practice 
of   the    law,  and    subsequently  became    Prosecuting 
Attorney  for  Miami  County.      This,  with  the  office  of 
Recorder  for  Montgomery  County  from  1813  to  1831, 
was    the   measure    of  his    official   appointment   of  a 
public  character.       In  1840  he  quit  the  law  practice 
and  removed  to  his  farm,  where  he  died  in  1877.    He 
was  twice  married.       His  first  wife  died,  leaving  one 
child,  named  Louisa.      He    was    married   the  second

bore   him    six    children,    named — Elizabeth,  Sophia, 
Alice,    Edmund    G.,   Warren    and    Hattie.      Warren 
Hunger,  Jr.,  is  at  this  time   in  the  practice  of   law 
at  Dayton,  Ohio.     Alice  Munger  was  married  to  W. 
F.  Gebhart,  who  at  one   time   was  proprietor  of  the 
foundry  and  a  large  stove  and  tinware  house  in  Con- 
nersville,  Fayette  Co.,  Ind.      Mr.  Gebhart  went  from 
Connersville  to  Dayton,  Ohio,  where  he  died   a  few 
years  since,  and  where  his  widow  now  resides.     Tru- 
man, the  second  child  of  Edmund  and  Eunice  (Kel- 
logg) Munger,  was  born  January  19,  1789.    He  lived 
with  his  parents  until  he  attained  his  majority,  when 
he   was   married   to   Elizabeth,  daughter  of  Samuel 
and    Catharine    (Byron)    Cole.      He   first    settled    in 
Montgomery  County,  Ohio.       In  1821,  at  Brookville, 
Ind.,  he  purchased  a  tract  of  land  in  Section  19,   in 
Posey    Township,  and    immediately    settled    upon  it. 
Here  he  resided   until  about  1840,  when  "he  sold  his 
farm  to  Temple  Beeson,  who  immediately  came  to  it. 
Mr.  Munger  went  thence  to  the  Wilson  Jones  farm, 
in  Wayne  County,  where  he  resided  but  a  short  time, 
when   he  went  thence  to  his  farm    near  Petersburg, 
Menard  County,  111.,  where  he  lived  until  he  became 
too  old  and  feeble  to  attend  to  the  duties  of  the  farm; 
then  he  sold  out  and  removed  to  Mason  County,  111., 
upon    a   farm    belonging  to  his  son-inlaw,  William 
Legg,    who  married   his   only   child    and  daughter, 
Malinda.      His   wife  died  August  20,  1863,    in  the 
seventy-first  year  of  her  age,  after    which  he  resided 
with  his  daughter  until  1866,   when  he   was  married 
the  second  time,  to  Alma  Maltbee,  of  Miami  County, 
Ohio,  after  which  he  went  to  Prairie  City   111.,  where 
he  died  May  18,  ]876,  in    the   eighty-eighth  year  of 
hie  age.     Mr.  Munger  and  his  first  wife  were  devoted 
members  of  the  Christian  Church,   and  their  upright 
deportment  commanded  the  confidence  and  esteem  of 
all.      Minerva,  the  fourth  child  of  Edmund  and  Eu- 
nice (Kellogg)  Munger,    was    born   in   Vermont,  No- 
vember 5,  1792,  and  died  April  26,  1874.     She  mar- 


ried ex- Judge  Amos  Irvin,  and  they  located  upon  a 
farm  near  Centreville,  Ohio,  where  they  reared  a 
family  of  seven  children,  named — Edmund  M. ,  Will- 
iam, Warren,  Isaac  N.,  Clarissa,  Rachel  and  Perry 
W.  Ex  Judge  Irvin  died  at  Piqua,  Ohio.  Reuben 
Munger  was  born  in  Vermont,  October  30,  1794.  He 
was  married  to  Laura  Harris,  of  Ohio,  who  bore  him 
several  children.  One  son  (John)  died  of  consump- 
tion at  New  Orleans,  La.,  while  on  a  tour  for  the 
benefit  of  his  health.  One  son,  Edmund  H,  was  for 
several  years  Judge  of  the  Circuit  Court  for  the  Dis- 
trict in  which  Lebanon,  Ohio,  is  situated.  He  is  now 
located  at  Xenia,  Ohio,  and  is  one  of  the  most  prom- 
inent lawyers  at  the  bar.  Reuben,  by  his  assiduity, 
perseverance  and  frugality,  connected  with  the  busi- 
ness of  carpentering  and  farming,  has  become  very 
wealthy.  His  wife  died  a  few  years  ago,  since  which 
time  he  has  lived  with  his  son  at  Xenia,  Ohio. 
Elisur  and  Festus,  the  sixth  and  seventh  children  of 
Gen.  Edmund  and  Eunice  (Kellogg)  Munger,  died  in 
infancy.  Eunice,  their  eighth  child,  was  born  in 
Montgomery  County,  Ohio,  February  10,  1801;  was 
married  to  W'illiam  McCann,  of  Ohio,  who,  in  1820, 
at  Brookville,  Ind.,  purchased  a  tract  of  land  in  Sec- 
tion 18,  Posey  Township,  Fayette  County,  and  imme- 
diately settled  upon  it.  He  for  a  time,  in  connection 
with  the  industry  of  his  farm,  was  engaged  in  the 
business  of  making  brick.  About  the  year  1825  he 
sold  his  farm  to  Elihu  Kellogg,  who  immediately  set- 
tled upon  it.  Mr.  McCann  went  thence  to  Rush 
County,  and  settled  upon  thy  farm  upon  which  Horace 
Elwell  now  resides,  located  east  of  Raleigh,  in  said 
county.  His  wife  died  in  1841.  He  married  a  second 
wife  and  removed  to  Iowa,  near  Iowa  City,  where  he 
died  soon  after.  Elihu  Kellogg  resided  upon  his 
farm  in  Posey  Township  until  he  died.  He  was  a 
brother  of  Gen.  Hunger's  wife.  Sarah,  the  ninth 
child  of  Gen.  Edmund  and  Eunice  (Kellogg)  Munger, 
was  born  March  15,  1803,  and  died  September  12, 
1883.  She  was  married  to  Elim  Irvin,  of  Ohio,  who 
was  born  November  17,  1801,  and  died  October  1, 
1841.  They  first  settled  in  Indiana  upon  a  tract  of 
land  in  Rush  County.  The  south  half  of  the  town  of 
Raleigh  has  since  been  laid  out  and  built  upon  the 
farm  where  they  lived  and  died.  Elim  is  a  brother 
to  ex-Judge  Amos  Irvin.  Festus  E.,  being  the  tenth 
child  of  Gen.  Edmund  and  Eunice  (Kellogg)  Mun- 
ger, was  born  April  11,  1805.  He  was  married  to 
Sarah  Harris,  who  bore  him  six  children.  They  set- 
tled near  Dayton,  Ohio.  Their  children  were  named 
Harris,  Felix,  Timothy,  Lyman,  Alvin  and  Laura. 
Three  of  the  boys,  Timothy,  Lyman  and  Alvin,  went 
into  the  Union  Army  at  the  commencement  of  the  late 
civil  war  in  1861.  One  of  them  had  an  inside  view 
of  Libby.     One  survived  seventeen  months  in  Ander-

sonville  and  other  Rebel  prisons.     Mr.  Munger's  wife 
died  several  years  ago.     He  is  at  this  time  residing  in 
Dayton,    Ohio,    with    a   second   wife.      Milton,    the 
eleventh  child,  was    born  October  5,  1807,  and  was 
married  to  Miss  Malinda  Maltbee,  of  Ohio.     He  at 
one  time  lived   upon   a  farm   near  Greenville;  went 
thence  to  a  farm  in  Miami  County;  thence  to  Piqua, 
Ohio,  where  he  died  in   1874,  and  where  his  widow 
now  resides.     They  reared  a  small  family  of  children. 
One  son — William— enlisted  in  the  Unioi}   Army  at 
the  beginning  of  the  late  war,  went  out  to  battle  but 
never  returned.      His  parents  could  never  learn  what 
became  of  him,  which  to  them  was  a  sad  and  sorrow- 
ful trial.     Isaac   N.,  the  twelfth  child  of  Gen.  Ed 
mund  and  Eunice  (Kellogg)  Munger,  was  born  August 
12,  1812;  was  married  to  Elizabeth  Bellville,  of  Ohio, 
December  8,  1834,   who  bore  him  several  children. 
Mr.  Munger  is  a  very  affable,    kind  and  exemplary, 
urbane  gentloman  of  high  culture.     His  vocation  has 
been  on  the  farm  mainly,  but  at  times  he  has  taught 
vocal  music.     He  has   retired  to  Piqua,  Ohio.     Ed. 
mund  K.  Munger,  the  subject  of  our  sketch,  moved 
with  his  parents  from  Vermont  to  Ohio  when  a  small 
boy.      He  lived  at  his  parental   home   until  his  mar- 
riage, which  occurred  December  17,  1812,  with  Miss 
Mary,  daughter    of  Samuel    and   Catharine    (Bryon) 
Cole,  who  was  born  in  Virginia  October  15,  1794,  and 
came  with  her  parents  to  Montgomery  County,  Ohio, 
at  an   early  date.     After  Mr.   Munger's  marriage  he 
settled  in  Montgomery  County.    He  went  into  the  war 
that  followed,  receiving  a  brevet  appointment,  but  his 
services  not   being  required    he   was   honorably  dis- 
charged.    At  Brookville,  ia  the  spring  of   1821,  he 
bought    200    acres    of    land    in    Section    19,    Posey 
Township,  Fayette  Co.,  Ind.,  and  in  October  of  the 
same  year  he   settled  upon  it,  with  no  timber  amiss 
except  that  which  had  been  cut  for  the  purpose  of 
erecting  his  cabin.       In  1838  he  built  a  brick  dwell- 
ing near  by  his    cabin    in    which    he    lived   until  his 
death,  which  occurred  June  10,  1872.     His  wife  died 
September  9,  1853.     They  had  twelve  children,  seven 
of  whom  are  now  living:     Norman,  Margaret,  Eliza- 
beth, Samuel,  Mary,  Lazarus  and  Edmund.     The  de- 
ceased are — Eunice,  Truman,  Martha,  Louisa  and  one 
unnamed.     Politically  Mr.  Munger  was  a  Whig  and 
a  Republican  from  1850.       Temperate  in  his  habits, 
moral,  a  respector  of  religion,  but  never  a  professor' 
kind  and  unassuming  in  manner,  he  had  the  love  and 
confidence  of  all.      Mrs.  Munger  was  a  devoted  mem- 
ber of    the  Baptist  Chitrch,  and  an  exemplary  Chris- 
tian.     Eunice,    daughter  of    Edmund   K.  and   Mary 
(Cole)  Munger,    was   born    in   Montgomery    County, 
Ohio,  February  24,  1814.     She  came  to  Posey  Town- 
ship with  her  parents  when  a  little  past  seven  years 
of  age.    She  was  a  member  of  the  Baptist  Church  since 


1832,   and  was  unmarried;    died  February  5,   1884. 
Norman    Munger   was    born   August   27,  1815.     He 
came  to  the  township  with  his  parents  in  1821,  and 
lived    with    them     until    his    marriage,    which    oc- 
curred March    11,  1847,    with  Ann   T.,  daughter   of 
Harley  Benson,  of  Rush  County,  Ind.,  after  which  he 
settled   upon    the   old    William    McCann    farm,  near 
Raleigh,  in  Rush  County;    went  thence  to  the  John 
McCarty  farm  in  Harrison  Township,  Fayette  County; 
thence  to  Wayne  County,  Ind.,  where  he  now  resides 
upon  the  Harrison  Shortridge  farm,  a  part  of  which 
he  owns.     Norman  is  not  a  professor  of  religion,  but 
his  wife  is  a  devoted  member  of  the  Baptist  Church. 
Mr.  Munger   has   been  an    invalid   for   four  or  five 
years.     They  had  two  children:    Martha  A.,  who  died 
in  infancy,  and  Mary  Jane,  who  is  married  to  George 
Kelsey,   and  with  whom  she  lives  in  the  home  of  her 
parents.     Mr.  Munger   was    a   Whig   prior  to  1856, 
since  which  time  he  has  been  a  Republican.   Margaret, 
the    third   child   of    Edmund   K.    and    Mary    (Cole) 
Munger,    was    born    in    Montgomery    County,   Ohio, 
June  12,  1817.       She  came  to  Posey  Township  with 
her  parents,  and  lived  with  them  until  February  4, 
1841,  when  she  was   united  in    marriage  with  Will- 
iam Manlove,  who  was  born  in  this  county  January 
19,  1815,  and  was  the  first  white  child  born  in  Posey 
Township  (see  sketch  of  George  and  Iilary  (Caldwell) 
Manlove).     They    settled    in    Posey   Township  where 
they  remained  permanently.       He  died  January  24, 
1883.       The  children  born  to  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Manlove 
were:   Oliver,  George  E.,  John  L.,  Emery  and  Mary 
L.     Oliver  died  July  29,  1882,  leaving  a  widow,  two 
little  daughters   and    an    infant    son.     Mrs.  Manlove 
joined  the  Baptist   Church   in    1832,  and    has    since 
adhered  to  the  same  faith.     She  owns  280  acres  of 
good    land  finely   situated.     Mr.  Manlove  was  a  re- 
spector but  not   a  professor  of   religion.      He  owned, 
previous  to  his  death,  800  acres  of  land.      Truman,

a  good  farmer  and  an  active,  energetic  business  man, 
a  good  and  kind  neighbor,  and  was  much  esteemed  by 
all.     Elizabeth,  fifth  child  and  daughter  of  Edmund

remained  until  their  death.  He  died  in  July,  1837; 
his  widow  survived  him  two  months.  Their  children 
were  as  follows:  James,  Samuel,  Jane,  Susan,  Sarah 
and  Richard,  our  subject  (the  only  one  of  the  family 
now  living).  He,  for  a  number  of  years,  in  his 
younger  days,  was  engaged  in  running  keel  and  flat 
boats  on  the  Ohio,  Kentucky  and  other  rivers.  He 
was  married  in  Adams  County,  Ohio,  in  1821,  to 
Mary,  daughter  of  Robert  and  Isabelle  (Russell)  Has- 
tings, natives  of  Ireland.     Shortly  after  his  marriage. 


and,  in  the  same  year,  he  moved  to  Fayette  County, 
Ind.,  entering  and  settling  on  the  farm  where  he  now 
lives,  and  has  resided  on  principally  since.  He  lost 
his  wife  by  death,  August  27,  1827,  and  in  the  next 
year  he  returned  to  Ohio,  and  resumed  his  old  trade 
as  riverman.  In  1832  he  was  making  a  trip  up  the 
Ohio  sixty-five  miles  above  Maysville  to  the  salt  works, 
when  the  boat  was  wrecked  in  a  storm  and  about  half 
the  crew  lost,  among  whom  was  the  Captain,  John 
Sullivan.  Shortly  after  this  disaster  he  quit  the 
business  and  returned  to  this  county.  He  was  again 
married,  on  this  second  occasion  to  Margaret  Mofiitt, 
a  native  of  Cumberland  County,  Penn.,  born  in  1806.

first  wife)  and  Jane,  William  G.,  Sarah,  Isaac  T., 
Eliza,  John  S.  and  Oliver  L.  (by  his  last  wife).  Mr.

JAMES  M.  OCHILTREE,    farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  is   a   direct    descendant   of   the   ancient 


"House  of  Ochiltree,"  of  Scotland.  In  March,  1564, 
John  Knox,  the  great  Scottish  reformer,  married  the 
daughter  of  Lord  Ochiltree,  one  of  the  ancestors  of  this 
family.  The  progenitors  of  the  family  emigrated  some 
time  in  the  seventeenth  century  to  escape,  it  is  said, 
the  Protestant  persecutions,  and  located  in  Virginia. 
From  the  latter  State  the  five  brothers  of  the  family 
(of  whom  our  subject's  father  was  one)  moved  to  dif- 
ferent points  and  established  families  of  their  own, 
except  David,  who  still  resides  in  Virginia.  Henry 
is  a  resident  of  Iowa;  Thomas  of  Missouri.  James, 
the  father  of  our  subject,  moved  with  his  family  to 
Ohio  in  1824  or  1825,  and  to  this  State  in  1840, 
locating  in  Henry  County,  where  he  died  in  1841; 
the  fifth  cannot  be  located.  Our  subject's  father  was 
born  and  reared  to  maturity  in  Rockbridge  County, 
Va.,  and  his  mother,  Catharine  Paxton,  grew  to  wom- 
anhood in  the  same  county.  There  were  nine  chil- 
dren in  the  family,  and  these,  one  by  one,  set  up  for 
themselves.  Oar  subject's  father  was  a  millwright 
by  trade,  but  had  been  chiefly  engaged  in  farming. 
In  1848  the  mother  and  children  moved  to  Glenwood, 
Rush  County,  and  in  1869  took  up  their  abode  in  this 
county.  James  M.,  our  subject,  was  born  in  Preble 
County,  Ohio,  in  1836.  For  several  years  he  worked 
by  the  month,  and  provided  for  his  mother  till  her 
death  in  1855.  In  1860  he  married  Jane  McCrory, 
who  was  born  in  this  county  in  1843,  a  daughter  of 
Robert  and  Celina  (Sexton)  McCrory.  Her  parents 
settled  on  what  is  now  Mr.  Ochiltree's  farm  in  1821, 
and  on  the  evening  of  their  arrival  made  their  beds 
on  the  ground  in  the  open  air  lor  want  of  shelter, 
first  being  compelled  to  remove  quite  a  heavy  coating 
of  snow.  After  his  marriage  Mr.  Ochiltree  rented 
land  for  a  few  years  and  then  purchased  124  acres, 
sioce  adding  106  more.  His  farm  is  provided  with 
an  excellent  stone  quarry  which  he  is  operating  quite 
extensively  and  successfully.  In  politics  he  is  a 
stanch  Republican,  voting  with  that  party  on  all 
questions  of  national  interest.  He  has  seven  children 
living:  William,  Thaddeus,  Robert,  Calvin,  James, 
Celina  C.  and  Jennie.  An  infant  daughter,  China,

and  Ivah  (Sutton)  Petro,  former  born  on  the  south 
branch  of  the  Potomac  River,  in  Virginia,  in  1790) 
latter  born  in  Pennsylvania  in  1792.  Michael  Petro 
moved  to  Ohio  when  a  youth,  was  married  there,  and 
in  1816  came  to  this  county  and  located  in  Jennings 
Township.  Here  he  purchased  land  and  spent  the 
chief  portion  of  the  remainder  of  his  life  in  diligent 
labor.  Mrs.  Petro  died  here  in  1852  and  Mr.  Petro 
subsequently  married  a  Mrs.  Funk  and  moved  to 
Attica,  Ind.,  where  he  closed  his  earthly  career  in 
1869.  Leonard  Petro,  the  subject  of  this  sketch, 
remained  on  the  farm  with  his  father  until  grown  to 
manhood.  At  the  age  of  nineteen  he  began  opera- 
tions as  a  hired  laborer  for  his  father,  with  whom  he 
was  engaged  about  three  years,  receiving  eighty 
acres  of  land  in  Randolph  County,  Ind.,  in  payment 
for  his  services.  He  continued  farming  and  adding 
to  his  original  purchase  until  he  owned  450  acres. 


This  he  divided,  for  the  most  part,  among  his  chil- 
dren, and  afterward  purchased  243  acres  in  Conners- 
ville Township.  He  moved  to  this  county,  purchased 
a  home  in  East  Connersville,  and  retired  from  active 
duty  to  take  the  rest  which  should  follow  so  many 
years  of  toil.  Mr.  Petro  was  married  in  1831  to 
Sarah  Lemon,  a  native  of  Kentucky,  in  which  State 
she  spent  her  girlhood.  Her  life  closed  in  1879 
leaving  eight  children:  Ivy  J.,  EdmondM.,  Margaret 
D.,  Eliza  E.,  Michael  C,  Benjamin  H.  H. ,  Anchor 
and  Nancy.  The  deceased  are:  Mary  E.,  Michael  C. 
and  George  W.  In  1881  Mr.  Petro  married  Matilda 
Walker,  widow  of  William  Walker,  and  with  whom 
he  is  quietly  spending  the  declining  years  of  his  life. 
He  is  a  man  of  liberal  heart  and  mind;  is  one  of  the 
honored  pioneers  of  the  county,  and  is  held  in  high 
esteem  by  all  who  know  him. 

JONATHAN  P.  PETRO,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  son  of  Michael  Petro,  was  born  in  War- 
ren County,  Ohio,  in  1815.  He  came  to  this  county 
with  his  parents  when  but  one  year  old,  and  has  ever 
since  resided  here.  He  passed  his  early  years  on  the 
farm,  having  but  the  limited  advantages  of  the  com- 
mon schools.  At  the  age  of  twenty-four  years  he 
married  Elizabeth  Dungan,  after  which  he  rented 
land  for  eight  years.  He  then  purchased  twenty-two 
acres  and  to  this  he  has  gradually  made  additions, 
as  his  means  would  allow,  till  he  now  owns  144  acres 
of  valuable  land.  He  has  three  children:  Absalom, 
Hiram  R.  and  Mary  E.,  now  the  wife  of  Peter  Fiant. 
Mr.  Petro  has  always  been  an  industrious  farmer, 
and  now  in  his  late  years  finds  himself  rewarded  with 
a  comfortable  home,  and  surrounded  by  many  friends. 
He  is  a  representative  of  one  of  the  oldest  families  in 
the  county;  a  careful  agriculturist;  his  farm  was  one 
of  the  early  Indian  resorts  of  this  locality. 

JOHN  PETRO,  farmer,  Jennings  Township.  The 
parents  of  John  Petro  were  Michael  and  Ivah  (Sut-

spectively. The  former  was  born  on  the  south  branch 
of  the  Potomac  River,  July  4,  1790.  In  early  youth 
he  moved  to  Ohio,  settling  in  Warren  County,  where, 
July  4,  1811,  his  marriage  with  Miss  Sutton  occurred. 
In  1816  they  removed  to  what  is  now  Jennings  Town- 
ship, first  living  for  a  period  within  two  miles  of  the 
present  farm  of  their  son  John;  thence  removed  to  that 
farm.  Mrs.  Petro  died  on  the  latter  farm,  April  9, 
1852,  and  Mr.  Petro  subsequently  moved  to  Fountain 
County,  Ind.,  and  there  died,  November  20,  1869.

ject was  born  on  the  farm  on  which  he  now  resides, 
Aprils,  1821.  His  educational  advantages  were  only 
such  as  were  afforded  in  the  district  schools.  He  was 
reared  on  the  farm  and  has  ever  since  followed  agricult- 
ural pursuits.     March  8,  1849,  he  was  united  in  mar-

has  had  two  children:  Ethel  M.  and  one  that  died  in 
infancy.  Soon  after  marriage  Mr.  Pike  settled  in 
Columbia  Township,  where  he  has  since  resided.  He

JOSIAH  PIPER,  farmer,  Fairview  Township. 
This  venerable  pioneer  of  Fayette  County  is  a  native 
of  Bourbon  County,  Ky.,  where  he  was  born  on  Feb- 
ruary 8,  1802,  son  of  William  and  Agnes  (McDow- 
ell) Piper,  who  were  descended  from  Irish  and  Welsh 
ancestry.  They  were  married  in  Bourbon  County, Ky., 
where  they  passed  their  lives  together,  and  to  them 
were  born  nine  children,  as  follows:  John,  Betsy, 
Nancy,  Israel,  James,  Samuel,  Jane,  William  and 
Josiah,  our  subject,  who,  in  point  of  age,  was  next 
to  the  eldest.  Josiah's  boyhood  was  passed  amid  the 
scenes  of  frontier  life.  He  remembers  making  fre- 
quent trips  in  early  life  driving  hogs  from  Paris,  Ky., 
to  Milledgeville,  Ga. ,  receiving  for  his  services  $8.00 
per  month.  Many  a  cord  of  wood  did  he  then  cut  for 
25  cents  per  cord.  He  also  frequently  visited  the 
Cherokee  Nations,  driving  thither  hogs,  and  he  re- 
calls that  for  one  of  these  journeys  he  received  130, 
with  which  he  purchased  a  colt,  the  first  horse  he  ever 
owned,  and  the  distance  walked  for  that  colt  was 
1,000  miles.  His  marriage  with  Margaret  Champ, 
who  was  also  a  native  of  Bourbon  County,  Ky.,  born 
May  3,  1802,  occurred  in  that  county  July  15,  1824, 
and  to  this  union  were  born  Harvey  M.  and  Susan  J. 
(wife  of  Daniel  Forsher).  In  October,  1825,  Mr.  Pi- 
per immigrated  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  locating  in 
Harrison  (now  Fairview)  Township,  arriving  October 
21,  same  month,  and  they  unloaded   their  goods  by 


the  side  of  a  log  in  the  thick  woods,  there  remaining 
for  several  weeks  until  they  had  cleared  a  spot  and 
built  a  small  cabin  within  half  a  mile  of  where  they 
now  live,  and  here  our  subject  and  wife  shared  the 
joys  and  trials  of  life  together  until  her  death,  which 
occurred  August  19,  1882.  Mr.  Piper  started  in  life 
a  poor  boy.  but  by  his  industrious  habits  and  excel- 
lent management  has  accumulated  a  fortune  seldom 
earned  and  saved  by  man,  he  being  among  the  wealth- 
iest men  of  Fayette  County,  his  possessions  amounting 
probably  to  upward  of  1 100, 000 ;  and  we  remark  that  on 
his  locating  in  this  county  he  possessed  only  sufficient 
means  to  purchase  eighty  acres  of  land.  He  has  been 
identified  with  the  Christian  Church  for  nearly  half 
a  century,  and  has  ever  taken  a  deep  interest  in  re- 
ligious work.  He  cast  his  first  Presidential  vote  for 
Henry  Clay,  and  with  the  Whig  party  voted  until  the 
organization  of  the  Republican  party,  with  which  he 
has  since  affiliated.  To  the  eighty  acres  of  land  above 
referred  to,  acres  upon  acres  have  been  added,  until 
he  now  looks  out  upon  some  800  acres,  all  in  a  body, 
of  as  good  land  as  there  is  in  the  county.  He  helped 
to  build  the  canal  and  railroad,  and  now  owns  four- 
teen shares  in  the  railroad.  He  is  a  gentleman  well 
preserved  for  one  of  eighty  two  years  of  age,  and  dur- 
ing that  long  period  has  never  been  confined  to  a  bed 
of  sickness  a  single  day.  His  mind  remains  intact, 
and  although  four  score  and  two  years  rest  upon  him, 
he  moves  with  alacrity,  and  recites  scenes  and  inci- 
dents of  the  past  with  clearness  and  precision. 

HARVEY  M.  PIPER,  son  of  Josiah  Piper,  whose 
sketch  appears  above,  was  born  in  Bourbon  County, 
Ky.,  May  26,  1825,  being  but  a  babe  at  the  time  of 
his  parents'  immigration  to  this  county.  January  22, 
1 852,  he  was  married  to  Lucinda,  a  daughter  of  John 
and  Elizabeth  Thrasher,  and  to  them  have  been  born 
two  children — Q.  H  and  Josiah  E.  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Piper  are  members   of  the  Christian  Church. 

SAMUEL  PIPER,  farmer  and  Township  Trustee, 
Jackson  Township,  is  a  native  of  that  township,  born 
September  8,  1839.  His  father,  David  Piper,  was 
born  in  Virginia,  March  10,  1811,  and  his  mother, 
Catharine  (Bash)  Piper,  was  born  in  Indiana,  March 
1,  1816.  They  were  married  April  5,  1831.  They 
were  both  members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal 
Chui-ch.  David  Piper  died  November  30,  1866.  The 
subject  of  this  sketch  received  a  common  school  edu- 
cation. He  was  united  in  marriage,  December  19, 
1871,  with  Miss  Sophia  Taylor,  who  was  born  in 
1848,  and  to  them  has  been  given  one  child — Gilbert 
C.  Mr.  Piper's  farm  consists  of  172  acres  of  land, 
Section  28.  He  was  elected  Township  Trustee  in 
April,  1884.  He  and  his  worthy  wife  are  members 
of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.

JOHN  S.  ROSS,  Columbia  Township,  one  of  the 
oldest  residents  of  this  county  now  living,  was  born 
in  Pennsylvania,  September  13,  1805.  He  is  a  son 
of  Thomas  and  Rachel  (Stockhouse)  Ross,  natives  of 
Pennsylvania,  and  of  Irish  and  Quaker  ancestry, 
respectively.  The  family,  for  several  generations, 
was  nurtured  among  the  mountains  of  Pennsylvania, 
and  here  the  subject  of  this  sketch  remained  with 
his  parents  till  his  seventeenth  year.  He  obtained 
a  fair  education  in  the  subscription  schools  of  his 
native  State,  and  at  the  age  above  mentioned  began 
an  apprenticeship  to  learn  blacksmithing,  with  Chris- 
topher Masters,  with  whom  he  remained  about  four 
years.  He  then  established  a  shop  of  his  own,  but 
was  compelled  to  abandon  his  vocation  on  account  of 
failing  health.  After  leaving  the  forge  Mr.  Ross 
began  operations  on  the  farm,  and  in  this  pursuit  he 
has  since  been  engaged.  In  1827  he  married  Hannah 
Masters,  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  and  daughter  of 
Christopher  and  Mary  (Curlin)  Masters  and  by  this 
union  nine  children  were  born,  all  now  living:  Mary, 
Francis,  Eleanor,  Christopher,  Thomas,  Rachel, 
Wesley,  Sally  and  Margaret  (twins).  In  1834  Mr. 
Ross  came  with  his  then  small  family  to  this  State, 
and  settled  in  Franklin  County,  where  he  purchased 
a  farm  on  which  ho  resided  about  nineteen  years.  In 
1853  he  moved  to  this  county  to  take  charge  of  the 
farm  where  he  now  resides,  and  which  was  purchased 
by  his  father  in  1839.  Here  Mr.  Ross  has  since  fol- 
lowed the  fortunes  of  a  quiet  farmer's  life,  and  here 
he  is  spending  his  declining  years.  His  father  died 
on  this  farm  in  1877,  aged  nearly  ninety-seven.  His 
mother  closed  her  existence  in  her  native  State  in 
1838.  His  faithful  wife,  who  had  been  his  constant 
companion  for  lifty-seven  years  of  toil  and  trial,  left 
his  side  March  17,  1884,  to  join  the  loved  ones  in 
that  better  world.  Mr.  Ross  is  one  of  the  stern  old 
Whig  Republicans,  though  he  has  never  been  drawn 
into  the  vortex  of  public  or  political  life.  He  is  com- 
fortably 8ui)plied  with  this  world's  goods,  the  fruits 
of  honest  labor,  and  is  well  preserved  in  body  and 
mind.  He  is  now  in  his  eightieth  year,  and  has 
never  been  confined  to  his  bed  by  sickness,  though  he 
has  suffered  some  afllictiou  in  late  years.

the  expenses  of  his  farm.  He  was  fond  of  hunting, 
and  met  with  many  adventures  while  in  pursuit  of  the 
sport.  On  one  occasion  he  lost  his  way  in  the  woods,

John  M.,  now  resides,  and  where  he  died  in  1871. 
His  widow,  who  was  born  in  1811,  is  still  living. 
John  M.  Eoss  grew  to  manhood  on  the  homestead 
farm,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty  years,  his  father  dying,

JOHN  JA.COB  SCHOLL  (deceased),  late  of  Jen- 
nings Township,  was  born  in  Schuylkill  County,  Penn., 
December  30,  1773.  His  father  was  born  in  Germany 
and  when  a  lad  emigrated  with  his  parents  to  America. 
The  vessel  in  which  they  took  passage  was  driven  by 
adverse  winds  into  the  tropics,  where  disease  and  death 
overtook  its  human  freight,  and  all  the  SchoU  family 
except  the  father  of  our  subject  perished,  and  were 
buried  at  sea.  After  landing  he  was  bound  out  for  a 
term  of  years  to  earn  the  price  of  his  passage  to  this 
country.  He  lived  and  died  in  Pennsylvania.  His 
five  children  were  Christena,  Leonard,  Peter,  Henry 
and  John  Jacob.  The  last  mentioned  was  married  to 
Margaret  Hetzell.  In  1833,  accompanied  by  his  wife 
and  children,  he  came  to  this  township,  purchasing 
100  acres  of  land  in  Section  26.  He  was  a  cooper  by 
trade.  With  the  aid  of  his  family  he  accumulated 
considerable  property.  He  died  April  19, 1870,  aged 
ninety-six  years,  three  months  and  nineteen  days,  his 
wife  having  preceded  him  October  19,  1854,  aged 
seventy-five  years.  They  were  both  members  of  the 
Lutheran  Church,  Springerville.  To  them  were  born 
fourteen  children:  John,  Catherine,  Sarah,  Elizabeth, 
Jacob,  Rebecca,  David,  Mary,  Joseph,  Anna,  Solo- 
mon, George,  Henry,  Judy.  Solomon  was  born  in 
Schuykill  County,  Penn.,  February  3,  1815.  He

Scholl  owns  nearly  100  acres  of  well-improved  land. 
He  has  voted  with  the  Republican  party  since  1850,  a

good  land,  and  is  living  surrounded  by  every  comfort 
heart  could  wish.  He  has  an  adopted  daughter —

JOSEPH  SCUDDER  (deceased),  late  of  Jennings 
Township,  was  a  native  of  Butler  County,  Ohio,  born 
July  4,  1820,  a  son  of  Enoch  and  Loraine  (Stevens) 
Scudder.  He  spent  several  years  on  the  farm  with 
his  uncle,  and  after  marriage  was  engaged  in  operat- 
ing a  saw- mi  11  for  Joseph  Cully  during  a  considera- 
ble period.  He  was  also  engaged  about  five  years  in 
the  sale  of  herb  medicines.  Mr.  Scudder  was  mar- 
ried, in  1840,  to  Elizabeth  Cully,  a  daughter  of 
Joseph  Cully,  a  native  of  Union  County,  Ind.,  and  to 
this  union  six  children  were  born:  William  L.,  James 
H.,  Levi  A.,  Charles  G.,  Benjamin  F.  and  Abraham 
L.,  all  now  living  and  well  established  in  homes  and 
businesses  of  their  own.  James  H.  and  Benjamin  F. 
are  conducting  a  livery  and  a  farm  in  Nebraska; 
William  L.  is  a  carriage  manufacturer  and  implement 
dealer  in  North  Judson,  Ind. ;  Levi  A.  is  farming  and 
operating  a  sawmill  in  Rush  County,  and  Abraham 
L.  is  a  merchant  at  Alqiiina,  this  county;  Charles  is 
a  farmer  at  Knightstown,  Ind.  In  1861  our  subject 
enlisted  in  Company  D,  Ninth  Indiana  Cavalry,  and 
entered  the  service.  About  one  year  later  he  was 
drowned  in  the  Ohio  River  by  an  unaccounted-for 
accident.  He  held  the  office  of  Orderly  Sergeant, 
and  was  in  a  fair  way  to  be  promoted,  and  it  is  vague- 
ly believed  that  a  rivalry  in  his  company  had  some- 
what to  do  with  his  premature  and  mysterious  end. 
His  body  was  recovered  and  subsequently  brought 
home  for  burial.  Mr.  Scudder  was  a  man  of  excel- 
lent character,  and  his  record  as  a  defender  of  the 
Union  is  one  of  which  his  posterity  may  justly  be 
proud.  His  widow  is  enjoying  the  comforts  of  a 
well-appointed  home,  and  the  satisfaction  of  seeing

RAWLSTON  SHIELDS  (deceased),  late  of  Con- 
nersville  Township,  one  of  the  early  farmers  of  prom- 
inence in  this  county,  was  born  in  Pennsylvania  in 
1790;  son  of  Robert  and  Nancy  Shields,  the  former 
a  native  of  Ireland,  from  which  country  he  was 
brought  to  the  United  States  when  but  eighteen 
months  old.  They  were  farmers,  and  died  in  Penn- 
sylvania, where  Mr.  Shields  was  reared  to  manhood. 
He  came  to  this  county  in  1817,  purchased  land  here 
and  followed  farming  during  the  remainder  of  his 
life  with  excellent  success.  In  1818  he  married  Han- 
nah Huston,  also  a  native  of  Pennsylvania,  and 
daughter  of  William  and  Margaret  Huston.  They 
had  six  children:  William,  Robert,  John,  James, 
Benjamin  and  Margaret.  The  deceased  are  William 
and  John.  Mr.  Shields  departed  this  life  in  1859,  leav- 
ing a  widow  who  still  survives  him- in  her  eighty - 
sixth  year,  the  last  of  a  family  of  ten  children.     He 


was  a  useful  man  and  highly  esteemed  by  all  who 
knew  him. 

LIEUT.  SAMUEL  J.  SHIPLEY,  retired  farmer 
and  ex  naval  officer,  Harrison  Township,  was  born 
in  Wilmington,  Del.,  December  24,  1813;  son  of  Jo- 
seph B.  and  Mary  H.  (Test)  Shipley,  the  former  born 
near  the  Brandywine,  Del.,  November  14,  1780,  and 
the  latter  near  Salem,  N.  J.  They  were  married 
April  16,  1804.  Samuel  Shipley,  the  grandfather  of 
Samuel  J.,  and  for  whom  the  latter  was  named, 
was  born  December  5,  1755.  His  wife,  Jane  (Ben- 
nett) Shipley,  was  a  sister  of  Caleb  Bennett,  who 
commanded  a  company  at  the  battle  of  the  Brandy- 
wine,  and  at  one  time  was  Governor  of  the  State  of 
Delaware.  The  brother  and  sisters  of  Samuel  J. 
were  named  and  born  as  follows:  Mary  A.,  born  Feb- 
ruary 29,  1805;  Charles,  born  August  17,  1807,  and 
Eliza  J.,  born  October  15,  1811.  Their  ancestors 
came  to  America  from  England  soon  after  William 
Penn  colonized  Pennsylvania,  and  were  of  his  relig- 
ious faith.  Our  subject,  when  a  school-boy  near  the 
Delaware  Bay  watching  the  ships  going  down  to  the 
ocean,  early  evinced  a  desire  to  go  to  sea,  and  in 
1833  he  made  application  for  an  appointment  as  Mid- 
shipman, the  application  being  indorsed  by  his 
friends  Daniel  Rench,  Samuel  W.  Parker  and  others, 
and  in  the  following  year  his  appointment  was 
received'through  Gen.  Jonathan  McCarty,  then  Mem- 
ber of  Congress  from  the  Connersville  District.  The 
young  naval  aspirant  was  soon  ordered  to  the  brigan- 
tine  "Enterprise,"  at  Norfolk,  Va.,  and  from  thence 
sailed  for  the  Brazilian  Station,  South  America,  soon 
after  reaching  which  he  was  transferred  to  the  flag- 
ship "Erie"  and  remained  on  that  station  nearly 
three  years,  returning  to  the  United  States  in  the  fall 
of  1837,  when  he  was  granted  a  leave  of  absence.  He 
returned  home  and  soon  after  purchased  the  farm  on 
which  he  now  resides  and  has  ever  since  made  his 
home  when  not  engaged  in  the  naval  service.  After 
the  expiration  of  his  furlough  he  was  ordered  to  the 
receiving  ship  "  Hudson "  at  New  York,  and  not 
long  thereafter  was  transferred  to  the  line-of  battle- 
ship "  North  Carolina  "  that  was  used  as  a  school  for 
apprentices.  The  class  of  1834,  to  which  he  be- 
longed, was  the  first  to  pass  an  examination  at  the 
Naval  Academy  established  at  Philadelphia  in  1889 
(subsequently  changed  to  Annapolis,  Md. )  In  June, 
1840,  soon  after  passing  his  examination,  young 
Shipley  was  ordered  to  the  West  India  Station  and 
joined  the  United  States  ship  "Warren"  at  Pensa- 
cola,  Fla.  He  made  a  cruise  with  that  vessel  to  the 
Spanish  Main  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico;  thence  went 
to  New  York,  where  he  was  granted  a  leave  of 
absence,  and  on  his  return  home  was  united  in  mar- 
riage,    November    14,    1841,    with    Martha    Holton,

daughter  of  Rev.  Jesse  and  Jane  Holton.  On  the 
expiration  of  his  leave  of  absence  he  joined  the 
United  States  ship  "Falmouth"  as  Sailing  Master, 
and  made  a  cruise  of  over  two  years  to  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico  and  West  Indies,  returning  home  in  1844, 
when  he  was  permitted  to  remain  with  his  family 
more  than  one  year.  In  1846  his  wife  died  at  the  age 
of  twenty-four  years,  leaving  a  daughter — Jennie — 
who  has  been  a  great  source  of  comfort  and  a  stay  to 
him  in  his  declining  years.  Soon  after  the  death  of 
his  wife  Master  Shipley  received  orders  to  join  the 
United  States  ship  "United  States"  as  Sailing  Master, 
bearing  the  broad  pennant  of  Com.  Read,  ordered  to 
the  coast  of  Africa.  (At  that  time  our  Government 
was  bound  by  treaty  with,  Great  Britain  to  keep  up  a 
force  of  eighty  guns  for  the  suppression  of  the 
slave  traffic.)  After  taking  on  board  a  new  battery  of 
fifty-two  guns  and  stores  they  started  for  the  Cape 
Verd  Islands  via  the  Azores,  going  from  Pico  south, 
passing  the  Canary  Islands,  sighting  the  Peak  of 
Teneriflfe  in  the  distance.  On  their  arrival  at  Porto 
Praya,  Cape  Verd  Islands,  their  place  of  rendezvous, 
they  took  on  board  stores  and  provisions  and  pro- 
ceeded down  the  coast,  visiting  Sierra  Leone,  Cape 
Mount  (a  noted  slave  mart),  stopping  some  time  at 
Monrovia,  at  which  place  Com.  Read,  Master  Ship- 
ley and  other  officers  dined  with  President  Rob- 
erts, whose  hospitality  they  had  been  invited  to 
share.  While  here  they  visited  Mission  House  School 
and  other  public  buildings.  From  Cape  Mesurado 
they  sailed  for  the  GuJf  of  Guinea,  anchoring  off 
Cape  Palmas,  thence  down  the  Ivory  and  Gold  Coast, 
passing  Cape  Three  Points,  and  anchoring  at  Cape 
Coast  Castle,  an  English  station  sti-ongly  fortified, 
and  which  in  times  past  they  had  hard  work  in  hold- 
ing against  the  war-like  Ashantees.  At  this  station 
within  the  enclosure  of  the  fort  is  the  tomb  of  the 
wife  of  Gov.  Maclean,  a  Scotch  gentleman  then  in 
charge  of  the  station.  She  was  an  English  poetess 
who  had  written  over  the  initials  L.  E.  L.  Also  here 
it  was  that  Elisha  K.  Kane,  the  Assistant  Surgeon 
and  enthusiastic  young  friend  of  our  subject,  took  his 
first  lesson  in  navigation,  and  a  few  degrees  to  the 
east,  in  the  kingdom  of  Dahomey,  near  the  mouth  of 
■the  riyer  Quorra  Niger,  came  near  losing  his  life  from 
exposure  in  exploring  that  benighted  and  God-for- 
saken land.  They  cruised  in  the  Bight  of  Benin  to 
the  mouth  of  the  river  Gaboon.  From  thence  they 
sailed  to  Prince's  Island,  anchoring  at  West  Bay  (an 
island  belonging  to  Portugal),  a  resort  for  whale 
ships,  and  while  there  the  crew  of  the  United  States 
vessels  witnessed  the  capture  of  a  whale  with  her 
calf.  They  next  sailed  for  their  place  of  rendezvous, 
St.  Jago,  Cape  Verd  Islands,  and  en  route  there, 
while  in  the  Gulf  of  Guinea,   upon  examination  it 


was  found  that  they  were  at  a  point  where  there  was 
neither  latitude  nor  longitude;  in  other  words,  they 
were  on  the  meridian  of  Greenwich  at  the  equator. 
On  arriving  at  Porto  Praya,  Master  Shipley  was 
appointed  to  take  charge  temporarily  of  the  depot  of 
supplies,  at  which  post  of  duty  he  remained  several 
months.  Dr.  Kane,  who  was  quite  sick,  remain- 
ing for  a  time  with  him.  About  June  1,  1847, 
Mr.  Shipley  returned  to  duty  on  board  the  ship, 
which  soon  afterwai'd  sailed,  and  they  made  their 
third  and  last  cruise  down  the  coast,  stopping 
several  days  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  Congo,  keeping 
near  the  coast  line,  so  near  that  they  could  see  the 
impenetrable  jungles  and  forests  with  occasional 
openings  and  villages.  At  this  time  the  United  States 
had  four  vessels — the  flagship  "United  States,"  the 
sloops  of  war  "Marion,"  "Dolphin"  and  "Boxen" — 
cruising  along  the  coast,  the  English  having  about 
the  same  number,  so  that  it  was  almost  impossible 
for  the  slave-runners  to  evade  their  vigilance.  From 
the  river  Congo  they  sailed  down  the  coast,  stopping 
at  St.  Paul  de  Loanda;  from  thence  to  Benguela  in 
latitude  13  degrees  south  of  the  equator;  thence  to 
within  a  short  distance  of  the  island  of  St.  Helena 
(noted  as  the  place  of  exile  of  Napoleon  Bonaparte); 
and  then  steered  for  the  Cape  Verd  Islands,  and  on  ar- 
riving at  Porto  Praya  fell  in  with  the  brig  "  Dolphin," 
which  had  on  board,  with  other  documents  from  the 
Navy  Department,  the  commission  of  Master  Shipley 
as  Lieutenant  in  the  United  States  Navy.  He  was 
then  transferred  to  the  United  States  brig  "  Dol- 
phin." In  1861  Lieut.  Shipley  tendered  his  services 
to  the  United  States  Government  and  went  to  Fortress 
Monroe  as  executive  officer  of  the  "  Brandy  wine," 
returning  home  on  account  of  sickness  in  1863. 
Since  retiring  from  the  navy  our  subject  has  lived 
somewhat  of  a  retired  life  on  his  farm  in  Harrison 
Township,  esteemed  and  respected  by  the  community 
at  large.

Union  County,  Ind.,  where  they  lived  two  years, then 
came  to  Jennings  Township,  this  county,  settling  on 
the  quarter-section  Nathan  now  resides  on.  Here 
Mrs.  Stanley  died  in  1840.  Coming  into  the  then 
wilderness  of  Indiana  in  an  early  day,  our  subject

five  children:  Frank,  Samuel  B.,  Laura,  Robert  and 
an  infant  son  (deceased).  Mr.  Stanley  has  had  no 
aspirations  for  the  empty  honors  of  office,  preferring 
rather  to  attend  to  his  own  affairs  than  to  those  of  an 
unappreciative  public.  In  early  life  he  was  allied 
with  the  Democratic  party,  but  for  many  years  he  has 
voted  the  Republican  ticket,  being  now  one  of  the  few 
living  old  Abolitionists  of  anti-slavery  days.  He  is 
well  posted  in  the  affairs  of  the  day,  and  possesses  to 
a  rare  degree  that  strong  natural  ability  that  makes 
some  men  conspicuous  among  their  fellows.  Mr. 
Stanley  has  a  large  farm  of  over  300  acres,  kept  in 
fine  order,  and  which  is  largely  the  reward  of  his 
labors.

CHARLES  M.  STONE,  with  a  twin  sister,  was 
born  in  Columbia  Township,  Fayette  Co.,  Ind.,  May 
26,  1821.  His  father,  Martin  Stone,  was  a  native  of 
Massachusetts;  his  mother,  Eliza  (Klum)  Stone,  was 
a  native  of  Vermont.  They  were  married  about  the 
year  1814,  and  moved  from  Pittsburgh,  Penn.,  in  the 
winter  of  1820,  and  settled  in  Fayette  County,  Ind. 
The  father  was  a  blacksmith  by  trade,  also  a  contractor 
on  public  works,  having  superintended  the  building 
of  the  first  macadamized  road  that  led  into  Pittsburgh. 
He  was  killed  by  the  falling  of  a  tree,  October  17, 
1821.  The  mother  afterward  taught  school  a  num- 
ber of  years  in  the  neighborhood  where  she  lived,  and 
died  March  25,  1849.  Y^oung  Stone  worked  on  a 
farm  and  attended  the  district  schools,  mostly  under 
the  tuition  of  his  mother  until  eighteen  or  nineteen 
years  of  age,  when  he  entered  the  seminary  at  Con- 
nersville,and  was  one  year  under  the  instruction  of  the 
late  Harvey  Nutting,  after  which  he  taught  a  country 
district  school  one  year.  He  was  married  to  Miss 
Lovisa  Carver,  September  18,  1842,  and  soon  after 
settled  on  the  farm  where  he  now  lives.  Mr.  Stone 
was  elected  Justice  of  the  Peace  in  the  year  1844,

in  1851 ;  was  again  elected  Justice  of  the  Peace  in 
1854,  resigned  in  1856,  and  was  again  elected  to 
represent  his  county  in  the  Legislature.  In  1858  he 
was  again  elected  Justice  of  the  Peace  and  served  up 
to  1876,  when  he  received  the  nomination  of  his  party 
for  County  Auditor.  Though  his  legal  term  as  Justice 
expired  before  the  date  for  the  election  of  Auditor,  the 
pretext  of  ineligibility  was  made  against  him  on 
account  of  the  commission  he  already  held,  and  to 
save  his  friends  and  his  party  from  any  trouble  that 


might  possibly  occur  he  quietly  withdrew  from  the 
race,  and  has  since  lived  in  retirement  on  his  farm. 
Mr.  Stone  was  originally  a  Whig  in  politics,  and 
afterward  a  Republican.  Through  life  he  has  always 
given  a  helping  hand  to  every  interest  of  his  country, 
and  especially  to  his  own  township  and  county.  To 
him  are  the  people  indebted  for  his  efforts  while  in 
the  Legislature  in  securing  the  enactment  of  laws,  and 
the  making  of  appropriations  for  the  encouragement 
and  benefit  of  the  agricultural  interests  of  the  State.

Swift,  a  native  of  New  Jersey,  who  moved  to  near 
Lebanon,  Ohio,  and  afterward  to  the  vicinitj'  of  Cin- 
cinnati, at  an  early  day  in  the  history  of  Ohio.  In 
1818  he  settled  in  Connersville,  then  comprised  of 
three  log-cabins.  Here  he  lived  until  his  death,  fol- 
lowing his  trade — shoe-making.  He  was  a  man  of 
strong  religious  convictions,  and  the  first  preaching 
of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church  was  held  at  his 
house.  Five  children  were  born  to  him,  one  now  living 
— Mary  Grace.  The  deceased  children  wore  named 
John,  Sarah  (wife  of  Robert  GrifiSs),  Mary  J.  (wife 
of  William  Sparks),  and  Artemesia.  John  Swift 
married  Mrs.  Elizabeth  Lockwood,  whose  maiden 
name  was  Thorp,  by  whom  he  had  four  children:  O. 
H.,  W.  R.,  Sarah  J.  and  A.  C.  Mrs.  Swift  died  April 
6,  1841,  aged  thirty-six  years.  Mr.  Swift  married  for 
his  second  wife  Mrs.  Maria  McColley,  whose  maiden 
name  was  Dale,  who  bore  him  three  children:  Char-

ing September  26,  1849,  aged  thirty-two  years,  Mr. 
Swift  married  for  his  third  wife  Sarah  Ann  Smith. 
John  Swift  died  October  15,  1882.  The  subject  of 
this  sketch  has  been  twice  married,  first  to  Malinda 
Daugherty,  in  1861,  by  whom  he  had  two  children: 
Mary  E.  and  James  O.,  the  latter  deceased.  Mrs. 
Swift  died  March  21,  1866;  born  May  15, 1844.  His 
present  wife,  Mary  A.  Clifton  (wee  Lake),  he  married 
December  31,  1867,  and  by  her  has  had  one  child — 
Florence  Ada.  Nine  years  ago  Mr.  Swift  located  in 
Bentonville,  where  he  kept  a  grocery  store  and  post- 
ofBce  eight  years.  Abandoning  these,  he  returned  to 
his  farm  of  108  acres  good  land.  He  and  his  wife 
are  members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church. 

WILLIAM  R.  SWIFT,  farmer  and  trader,  Jack- 
eon  Township,  is  a  native  of  this  county,  born  in 
Connersville  Township,  June  14,  1833.  His  father, 
John  Swift,  was  born  in  Centerville,  Ohio,  September 
12,  1806,  and  with  his  father,  Robert  Swift,  moved 
in  1818  to  Connersville,  then  only  a  few  log-houses. 
Robert  Swift  stands  at  the  head  of  the  list  of  Meth- 
odists in  Connersville.  In  his  house  the  first  society 
was  organized  for  class  meetings,  he  being  appointed

Leader.  Preaching  was  also  held  at  his  house  for 
some  time.  John  Swift  in  early  life  was  a  merchant 
and  kept  a  hotel;  in  middle  life  he  was  a  farmer  and 
trader  in  stock  and  real  estate.  In  his  older  days  he 
lived  a  retired  life,  having  accumulated  considerable 
wealth.  He  died  in  the  Methodist  faith,  October  15, 
1882.  William  R.,  our  subject,  enjoyed  a  good  com- 
mon school  education.  He  farmed  until  he  was  of 
age,  and  then  traded  in  stock.  He  was  married, 
December  17,  1867,  to  Mrs.  Cassie  G.  Snowden,  who 
was  born  February  28,  1840,  daughter  of  William  G. 
and  Sarah  Smith,  natives  of  Maryland,  where  the 
former  was  born  August  3,  1796,  the  latter  January 
27,  1802.  Mr.  Smith,  during  the  war  of  1812,  par- 
ticipated in  Perry's  victory,  and  took  charge  of  300 
prisoners,  escorting  them  to  Philadelphia  for  safe 
keeping.  He  and  his  wife  came  to  Indiana  in  1835, 
and  spent  their  declining  years  with  Mr.  Swift.  Our 
subject  has  been  successful.  His  farm  of  ninety 
acres  is  located  on  Section  7.  He  and  his  estimable 
wife  are  members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal 
Church. 

JAMES  H.  TATE,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship. The  gentleman  whose  name  heads  this  sketch 
is  a  descendant  of  one  of  the  earliest  settlers  of  this 
county.  He  was  born  four  miles  southwest  of  Con- 
nersville, July  20,  1830,  and  is  a  son  of  William  A. 
H.  Tate,  who  is  still  living,  in  his  eightieth  year  (see 
sketch  of  John  Tate).  He  spent  bis  early  years  upon 
the  farm  with  his  parents,  and  obtained  a  fair  educa- 
tion in  the  district  schools.  At  the  early  age  of  nine 
years  he  began  working  for  himself  as  United  States 
Mail  Carrier,  an  occupation  which  he  has  since  en- 
gaged in  to  a  greater  or  less  extent.  A.t  the  age  of 
twenty-one  he  entered  into  his  iirst  contract  with  the 
Government,  for  carrying  a  triweekly  mail  between 
Connersville  and  Eushville,  having  charge  of  several 
other  routes  at  the  same  time.  This  constituted  his 
principal  occupation  up  to  1857,  on  December  23  of 
which  year  he  was  married  to  Miss  Louisa  Holstead, 
also  a  native  of  this  county,  and  a  daughter  of  Hick- 
son  and  Eliza  (Jones)  Holstead,  who  were  among  the 
first  settlers  here  from  Kentucky.  Mr.  Holstead  is  a 
native  of  New  York  State;  is  in  his  eighty-fifth  year 
and  very  spry.  After  his  marriage  Mr.  Tate  turned 
his  attention  to  farming,  gardening,  etc.,  and  this 
occupation  has  chiefly  engaged  him  since  that  date. 
He  was  engaged  in  the  carpenter's  trade  from  1856  to 
1861,  however,  and  in  that  interval  contracted  for 
and  erected  most  of  the  schoolhouses  in  this  town- 
ship. In  1852  he  and  his  father  purchased  fifty-two 
acres,  and  on  this  farm  Mr.  Tate  has  lived  ever  since 
his  marriage.  He  received  ten  acres  of  the  farm  and 
the  house  which  was  erected  in  1843-44,  and  here  he 
brought  his  young  bride,    with  whom  he  was  ever 


after  to  dwell  in  the  independent  pursuits  of  farm 
life  and  the  discharge  of  his  official  duties.  From 
about  1860  Mr.  Tate  served  as  Assessor  for  twelve 
years.  He  was  gate-keeper  at  the  county  fair  for 
twenty-eight  consecutive  years,  and  served  seven 
years  in  the  same  capacity  at  the  State  fair  at  Indian- 
apolis. He  has  also  served  as  Deputy  Sheriff,  and  is 
in  every  sense  a  very  useful  citizen,  always  discharg- 
ing his  duties  with  credit  and  satisfaction.  Mr.  Tate 
has  eight  children  living:  John  E.,  Emery  E.,  Maud 
M.,  William  H.,  Curtis  F.,  James  H.,  Jr.,  Orley  and 
"  Tip,''  the  last  mentioned  only  nicknamed.  Maud 
M.  and  E.  E.  are  engaged  in  teaching  school.  "  Tip," 
after  the  nomination  of  Mr.  Cleveland  for  President, 
named  himself  Grover  C.  Tate.  He  is,  perhaps,  the 
first  child  in  the  United  States  named  for  Cleveland, 
who  now  occupies  so  prominent  a  position.  The 
paternal  side  of  the  family  is  essentially  a  family  of 
musicians,  and  most  of  the  above-named  children,  as 
well  as  the  father,  are  devotees  of  Apollo,  the  house 
furnishing  an  orchestra  of  eight  pieces— three  horns, 
four  violins  and  one  organ.  Mr.  Tate  is  a  Repub- 
lican of  the  old  Whig  stamp,  and  one  of  the  most 
wide-awake  citizens  of  the  county.  His  possessions 
have  increased  to  172  acres,  and  this  is  well  improved 
and  cultivated. 

JOHN  TATE,  farmer,  Connersville  Township. 
The  gentleman  whose  name  introduces  this  sketch  is 
a  son  of  W.  A.  H.  Tate,  one  of  the  pioneers  of  this 
county,  and  was  born  in  Connersville  Township,  this 
county,  Oct.  1,  1832.  His  mother  was  Louisa  Cunning- 
ham. His  parents  came  to  this  township  from  Virginia 
in  a  very  early  day.  On  the  farm  where  they  endured 
their  frontier  trials  and  hardships,  the  old  cabin  which 
first  sheltered  them  still  stands,  surrounded  by  a  rem- 
nant of  the  old  orchard  which  they  planted.  William 
Tate,  the  greatgrandfather  of  our  subject,  was  an 
officer  in  the  Revolutionary  war,  and  the  latter  has  in 
his  possession  a  silver  button,  on  which  is  engraved 
the  initials  "  \V.  T."  and  dated  1775,  the  same  having 
been  taken  from  the  old  Revolutionary  hero's  uniform. 
Our  subject  resided  on  the  farm  with  his  parents  till 
twenty-seven  years  of  age.  He  obtained  a  good  com- 
mon school  education,  and  this  he  has  supplemented 
by  several  years  of  careful  self-culture  gleaned  from 
his  own  private  library,  being  thoroughly  up  to  the 
times,  on  the  topics  with  which  he  is  remarkably  con- 
versant. On  arriving  at  his  majority  Mr.  Tate  began 
business  as  a  United  Slates  Mail  Contractor,  and  con- 
tinued in  the  employ  of  the  Government  four  years, 
doing  some  farming  in  the  meantime.  He  was  next 
engaged  in  carpentering,  erecting  school  buildings  in 
various  parts  of  the  county,  assisting  his  father  and 
brother.  December  23,  1858,  he  married  Miss  Mary 
A.    Conaway,    a   native   of    Orange    Township,  and

daughter  of  A.  S.  and  Elizabeth  (GrifiSn)  Conaway. 
After  his  marriage  Mr.  Tate  resided  on  the  farm  of 
his  father-in-law  three  years  and  then  removed  to  his 
present  home  of  117  acres,  which  he  purchased  in 
1864.  Here  he  has  since  resided,  and  although  vari- 
ously engaged  during  the  time,  has  given  his  chief 
attention  to  agricultural  pursuits,  always  being  alive 
to  the  best  interests  of  his  community.  He  was  a 
prominent  worker  in  the  organization  of  the  Green- 
back party  at  Indianapolis,  in  June,  1874,  and  for 
the  past  thirty  years  has  been  an  active  member  of 
the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  with  which  he  has 
been  connected  oflicially  twenty-five  years.  In  its 
day  he  was  a  prominent  leader  in  the  grange  move- 
ment, but  of  late  years  has  not  given  much  attention 
to  public  affairs.  Mr.  Tate  is  a  man  of  decisive  char- 
acter and  a  very  useful  citizen  in  his  community. 
His  family  of  children  are  four  in  number:  William 
A.,  Mary  L.,  John  C.  and  Myrtle  M.  Two  infants 
are  deceased.  The  eldest  son  is  engaged  in  the  study 
of  law  at  Connersville. 

SYDNEY  J.  TAYLOR,  farmer,  Harrison  Town- 
ship, was  born  in  Saratoga  County,  N.  Y.,  January  8, 
1819.  His  father,  Joseph  Taylor,  was  born  in  Hamp- 
den County,  Mass.,  December  2,  1791,  and  died  May

which  he  followed  till  1850,  then  engaged  in  carpen- 
tering until  1863.  He  was  married,  April  10,  1862, 
to  Miss  Harriet  Ludlow,  who  was  born  in  this  town-

Road  Supervisor;  has  been  a  member  of  Harrison 
Lodge,  No.  84,  I.  O.  O.  F.,  since  1852.  His  father 
was  drafted  in  the  war  of  1812,  but  as  his  employer 
could  not  spare  him  from  the  business,  was  obliged 
to  hire  a  substitute. 

BENJAMIN  THOMAS,  farmer,  Harrison  Town- 
ship, is  another  of  the  pioneer  settlers  of  the  valley, 
who  came  to  it  when  it  was  almost  an  unbroken  for- 
est, and  for  a  period  of  upward  of  sixty  years  has  he 
been  cognizant  of  the  wonderful  changes  wrought  by 
the  onward  march  of  progress,  in  which  he  has  played 
his  part.  His  birth  occurred  in  Allegany  County,  N. 
Y.,  on  the  22d  of  August,  1802,  son  of  John  and 
Sarah  N.  (Beardroufif)  Thomas,  natives  of  New  York 
State,  whore  the  mother  died  in  1810.  About  the 
year  1818  the  father  removed  to  Ohio  and  in  1822  to 
Indiana,  locating  in  what  is  now  Fayette  County. 
He  was  twice  married.  By  his  first  wife  were  born 
Benjamin,  Jesse,  Gilbert  and  Stephen.     His  second 


wife,  Sarah  Simons,  bore  him  one  child — Sallie.  He 
was  a  soldier  in  the  war  of  1812,  an  honorable  citizen, 
much  respected.  Our  subject  was  reared  to  agricult- 
ural pursuits,  and  received  but  meagre  educational 
advantages.  In  1829  he  was  united  in  marriage  with 
Miss  Eliza  Savage,  a  native  of  Maine.  To  this  union 
were  born  Jesse  H.,  Sarah  A.,  Eliza  J.,  Oliver  C, 
Margaret,  Samuel,  Mary  A.,  Austin,  Benjamin  W., 
Winfield  S.  and  Hannah  E.  Sarah  A.  died  Novem- 
ber 9,  1851,  and  Oliver  C.  died  in  the  hospital  Sep- 
tember 13,  1862,  of  erysipelas,  while  serving  his 
country  as  a  member  of  Company  L,  Second  Regi- 
ment Indiana  Cavalry.  The  wife  of  our  subject  died 
February  22,  1857,  and  he  subsequently  married 
Francena  Reed,  whose  death  occurred  two  years  later. 
His  third  marriage  was  with  Mary  A.  Keener.  Mr. 
Thomas  and  a  portion  of  the  family  are  members  of 
the  Methodist  Episcopal  Church.  He  is  a  well-to-do 
farmer  aod  a  most  excellent  citizen. 

JAMES  THOMAS,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship, was  born  in  this  county  in  1827,  son  of  Joseph 
and  Elizabeth  (Fixley)  Thomas,  natives  of  Ohio  and 
Kentucky,  respectively,  and  who  married  in  this 
county  and  resided  here  most  of  their  lives.  The 
father  died  in  Huntington  County,  Ind.,  in  1860,  the 
mother  in  Logansport  in  March,  1881.  Our  subject 
resided  with  his  parents  till  he  was  twenty-four  years 
of  age,  and  in  1851  married  Margaret  A.  Jones,  also 
a  native  of  this  county  and  daughter  of  William  and 
Lucinda  (Ginn)  Jones,  who  settled  in  this  county 
during  the  period  of  its  Indian  history.  After  his 
marriage  Mr.  Thomas  engaged  in  farming  up  to  1860. 
He  then  worked  at  the  stone-mason's  trade  at  Hunt- 
ington, Ind.,  for  five  years,  returning  to  this  county 
in  1865,  and  purchasing  his  present  farm  of  seventy- 
three  and  one- half  acres  in  1874.  He  has  since  been 
chiefly  employed  on  the  farm,  doing  an  occasional 
job  of  stone  work  for  his  neighbors  when  called 
upon.  He  has  been  quite  successful  in  pursuits,  and 
by  hard  labor  has  earned  for  himself  a  comfortable 
home.  Mr.  Thomas  is  the  father  of  five  children: 
Josephine,  Eliza  A.,  Lucinda,  John  and  Edward — 
all  married  but  the  latter.  In  politics  Mr.  Thomas 
is  a  Republican,  not  aggressive  in  his  sentiments,  but 
choosing  to  let  every  man  think  and  vote  as  he  pleases.

HON.  WOODSON  W.  THRASHER,  farmer, 
Fairview  Township,  was  born  in  Pendleton  County, 
Ky.,  February  4,  1812.  His  parents,  John  and 
Elizabeth  (Rush)  Thrasher,  were  natives  of  Ken- 
tucky and  of  English  and  Irish  extraction.  John 
Thrasher  was  a  son  of  Josiah  Thrasher,  a  native  of 
Maryland,  and  his  father,  John  Thrasher,  Sr.,  was 
one  of  three  brothers  who  emigrated  from  England 
to  the  United  States  during  the  Revolutionary  war. 
He  first  settled  in  Maryland  and  was  there  manied

Mary,  Nancy,  William,  Josiah,  Maria,  Lucinda,  Caro- 
line, Joseph  and  an  infant  son  who  died  unnamed. 
Our  subject  with  his  parents  moved  to  Rush  County, 
this  State,  in  1824,  and  resided  with  them  until  his 
marriage  in  1831,  with  Barbara,  daughter  of  Philip  and 
Barbara  Daubenspeck,  born  in  Bourbon  County,  Ky., 
February     14,     1811.      After     his     marriage     Mr. 
Thrasher  settled  just  over  the  line  from  his  father  in 
Fayette  County,  where  he  has  since  resided,  giving 
his  attention  to  agricultural   pursuits,   having  been 
extensively  engaged  in  breeding  and  raising  improved 
stock,  and  to  him  are  the  people  of   this  section  of 
Indiana  largely  indebted  for  the  fine  stock  with  which 
the  farms  abound.     He  has  as  prominently,  too,  been 
connected  with  all   enterprises   and   interests   of  the 
county  which    have  had   a  tendency  to    develop  the 
resources  and  to  educate  and  Christianize  her  people. 
The  subjects  of  education  and  Christianity  have  ever 
been  close  to  his  heart  and  to  their  advancement  he 
has  given  much  of  his  mighty  energy  and  liberally  of 
his  means,  being  largely  instrumental  in  establishing 
the  academy  at  Fairview  and  the  Christian   Church 
near  by,  with  which  both  himself  and  wife  have  been 
connected  for  forty  years  or  more;  he  having  been  an 
Elder  therein  during  the  greater  part  of   the  time. 
As  an  evidence  of  his  interest  in  Ihe  subject  of   edu- 
cation we  have  but  to  state  that  all  his  eight  children 
are  collegiate  graduates  and  among  them  are  a  prom- 
inent physician  in  Cincinnati,   a  Professor  of  Mathe- 
matics in  Butler  College  at  Indianapolis,  and  another 
a  graduate   of   the   profession  of   law.     The  father 
of  Mr.  Thrasher  before  him  was  a  Whig,  with  which 
party  our  subject  was  in  his  younger  life   identified, 
casting  his   first    vote    for   Henry   Clay.     Since  the 
organization  of  the  Republican  party  he  has  been  a 
warm  advocate  of  its  principles.     He  at  one  time  was 
one  of  the  County  Commissioners,  and  in   1867  was 
chosen  by  the  citizens  of  the  county  a  Representative 
in  the    State  Legislature,  where  he  at  once  became 
conspicuous   and   was    identified   with   the    leading

measures  that  came  before  the  Legislature  during  his 
term  of  service  in  the  years  1867  and  1868.  He  was 
Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Eoads  and  Highways; 
he  also  served  on  a  committee  appointed  to  visit  and 
report  the  condition  of  the  Southern  prison  at  Jef- 
fersonville;  the  Chairman's  report  he  refused  to  sign, 
and  with  another  colleague  drew  up  a  minority  report, 
which  was  accepted  by  the  Legislature.  He  was 
largely  instrumental  in  securing  the  passage  of  the 
Indiana  drain  or  ditching  law  enacted  during  his 
service,  which  bill  he  was  greatly  interested  in.  His 
name  is  also  prominently  connected  with  other  im- 
portant measures  of  which  for  the  want  of  space  we 
must  here  leave  unmentioned.  Mr.  Thrasher  has 
been  evidently  successful  in  life,  and  has  been  blessed 
with  most  excellent  health.  Seldom,  if  ever,  has  he 
been  confined  to  bed  dui-ing  his  long  life  on  account 
of  sickness;  and  it  is  greatly  to  his  credit  to  remark 
that  he  has  never  been  engaged  in  a  lawsuit  He 
started  in  life  with  small  means,  but  by  thrift  and 
industry  he  has  accumulated  a  handsome  competency. 
His  children  all  grew  to  manhood  and  womanhood. 
Their  names  are  William  M.,  Elizabeth,  John  P., 
Marion,  Harriet,  Sarah,  Allen  B.  and  Oliver. 

WILLIAM  R.  TYNEB,  farmer,  Harrison  Town- 
ship, is  a  native  of  Indiana,  born  May  3,  1835.  His 
father,  Samuel  G.  Tyner,  was  born  in  Brookville 
Ind.,  and  died  June  3,  1883.  He  farmed  all  his  life. 
Our  subject  received  a  common  school  education.  He 
was  married,  February  13,  1873,  to  Miss  Elizabeth 
Williams,  a  native  of  Indiana.  To  this  union  has 
been  born  one  child— Sadie.  Mr.  Tyner  has  been 
Road  Supervisor.  He  has  spent  his  life  in  farming, 
and  is  an  industrious,  reputable  citizen. 

GEORGE  VAN  BUSKIRK,  farmer,  Posey  Town- 
ship, was  born  in  Kentucky,  July  9,  1802,  son  of 
George,  Sr.,  and  Mary  (Rulony)  Buskirk,  who  settled 
in  Wayne  County,  Ind.,  in  1815,  where  both  died. 
They  had  six  children,  all  now  deceased  but  our  subject. 
He  was  married,  in  1826,  to  Rachel  Helm,  who  was 
born  in  Ross  County,  Ohio,  October  9,  1805.  In  1830 
he  left  Wayne  County,  Ind.,  and  settled  in  Posey 
Township,  Fayette  County,  same  State,  where  he  has 
since  resided,  and  has  prospered.  He  is  the  father  of 
twelve  children,  nine  of  whom  are  now  living:  Harriet, 
Tillman,  Daniel,  Ruben,  Martha,  Nancy,  Martin, 
Catherine  and  Perry.  Sidney,  Elizabeth  and  Mary 
are  deceased  Daniel  is  a  minister  of  the  Christian 
Church,  and  is  called  the  "  Beecher  of  the  West." 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Van  Buskirk  are  members  of  the  same 
church,  with  which  they  have  been  connected  over 
half  a  century. 

JAMES  VANHORN,  farmer,  Connersville  Town- 
ship, one  of  the  wealthiest  and  most  prominent  colored 
men  of  this  county,  was  born  a  slave  in  Pendleton 


County,  Ky.,  January  15, 1804.  His  father  was  a  white 
native  of  Germany,  which  fact  perhaps  accounts  for 
the  persevering  and  industrious  habits  which  have 
characterized  Mr.  Vanhorn's  whole  life.  Mr.  Van- 
horn  passed  his  early  years  in  his  native  State  on  the 
plantation  of  his  master,  Josiah  Thrasher,  by  whom 
he  was  retained  till  nearly  twenty-two  years  of  age. 
He  then  made  his  escape  to  the  North  and  located  in 
Rush  County,  Ind.,  where  he  resided  but  a  few  years, 
when  he  came  to  this  county.  For  one  year  he  made 
his  home  with  John  Thrasher,  a  son  of  his  former 
master:  from  there  he  went  to  Billy  McCarty's,  where 
he  resided  two  years;  thence  he  moved  to  John  Cald- 
well's, also  to  Gen.  Caldwell's,  where  he  was  engaged 
chiefly  in  teaming  goods  from  Cincinnati  to  this  sec- 
tion of  the  county  for  the  resident  merchants,  and 
where  he  bought  his  freedom  for  1250,  his  own 
money.  About  1840  he  purchased  160  acres  in 
Blackford  County,  Ind.,  trading  this  tract  for  eighty 
acres  of  his  present  farm  about  1854.  By  hard  and 
continued  labor  he  has  since  been  able  to  add  to  his 
original  possessions  till  he  now  owns  121  acres  of 
valuable  land.  Previous  to  his  marriage,  Mr.  Vanhorn 
was  employed  as  bar  keeper  on  the  steamboat  "Adri- 
atic," plying  between  Cincinnati  and  New  Orleans, 
and  although  constantly  engaged  for  some  time  in 
mixing  and  dealing  out  liquors  of  various  kinds,  was 
never  kaowu  to  taste  them  himself.  Mr.  Vanhorn 
was  married,  July  3,  1842,  to  Miss  Nancy  Foster, 
who  was  born  in  Ohio.  Nine  children  blessed  this 
union,  seven  now  surviving:  Oliver,  John  A.,  Francis 
M.,  Harriet,  Malinda,  Charles  and  Cordelia.  AVesley 
and  Eliza  are  deceased.  Mrs.  Vanhorn  passed  away 
January  3,  1880.  Mr.  Vanhorn  may  well  be  re- 
garded as  one  of  the  successful  farmers  of  this 
county.  He  is  a  most  worthy  example  to  his  race, 
and  his  life  furnishes  abundant  proof  of  the  advan- 
tages of  freedom  of  thought  and  action.  He  is 
regarded  as  one  of  the  most  reliable  citizens  in  this 
community,  and  is  entitled  to  great  credit  for  his 
industry  and  good  character. 

JOHN  WALKER,  farmer,  Jennings  Township, 
was  born  on  the  old  homestead,  April  13,  1828,  son 
of  William  Walker,  who  was  born  in  Virginia  in 
1777.  The  latter,  a  son  of  Charles  Walker,  also  a 
Virginian,  settled  near  Chillicothe,  Ohio,  among  the 
Indians,  at  a  very  early  day  in  the  settlement  of  Ohio, 
and  there  died.  William  Walker  was  married  in 
Ohio  to  Jane  Corbet,  by  whom  he  had  twelve  children, 
four  of  whom  are  now  living:  Joseph,  James,  Samuel 
and  John.  The  deceased  are  Jane,  Henry,  Willis, 
Alexander,  William,  Frances,  Eliza  J.  and  Lewis. 
In  1819  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Walker,  with  their  two  chil- 
di-en,  Henry  and  William,  removed  to  and  settled  in 
Jennings  Township,  this  county,  entering  160  acres

of  land.  Mr.  Walker  was  poor  in  purse,  depending 
entirely  on  his  own  exertions  for  a  living,  bnt  he  was 
energetic  and  made  good  progress  from  the  start, 
accumulating,  with  the  aid  of  his  family,  about 
3,500  acres  of  land.  He  was  a  man  of  honor,  ster- 
ling character,  and  whose  word  was  as  good  as  his 
bond.  He  and  his  wife  were  members  of  the  Meth- 
odist Church,  in  which  they  worked  for  Christ  and 
their  soul's  salvation  till  called  to  a  higher  reward. 
Mr.  Walker  served  in  the  war  of  1812.  He  was  a 
Jacksonian  Democrat  at  one  time,  but  joined  the 
Whig  party,  and  died  in  the  ranks  of  the  Repub- 
lican party.  He  died  May  17,  1859,  aged  eighty- 
two  years,  his  wife  having  preceded  him  June  15, 
1855,  aged  seventy-two  years,  six  months.  Our 
subject  was  married,  in  1853,  to  Mary  E.,  daughter 
of  David  and  Elizabeth  (Lemmon)  Berry,  by  whom  he 
had  three  children:  Eugene  J.,  Frances  S.  and  Albert 
S.  He  has  always  lived  within  half  a  mile  of  his 
birth-place.  He  has  prospered,  and  now  owns  230 
acres  of  good  land.  He  is  a  devoted  member  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  with  which  he  has  been 
connected  for  many  years.  He  is  an  uncompromising 
Eepublican,  and  takes  more  than  an  average  interest 
in  j)ublic  affairs. 

FOREST  M.  WEBB,  farmer,  Columbia  Town- 
ship, is  a  native  of  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  and  is 
descended  from  an  old  and  well  respected  family  of  the 
county.  His  parents  were  Forest  M.  and  Clarissa

to  this  county  in  a  very  early  day.  The  former  was 
born  in  Boone  County,  April  4,  1802,  a  son  of  Ed- 
ward Webb,  who  wa.s  born  in  Virginia,  November  21, 
1769,  and  who  emigrated  thence  to  Boone  County, 
Ky.,  in  a  very  early  day.  From  there  he  moved  to 
the  Territory  of  Indiana,  first  settling  near  Harrison, 
Ohio,  and  in  1814  came  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  set- 
tling in  Columbia  Township,  where  he  remained 
until  his  death,  which  occurred  July  29,  1851.  He 
was  a  man  of  considerable  ability,  and  figured  con- 
spicuously in  the  early  affairs  of  the  county.  He 
was  chosen  on  the  organization  of  the  county  one  of 
its  Associate  Judges,  which  position  he  filled  for 
twenty-seven  years  consecutively — see  history  proper 
of  Columbia  Township.  Forest  M.,  his  son,  and  the 
father  of  our  subject,  came  with  him  to  this  county  in 
1814,  and  was  here  united  in  marriage  with  Clarissa 
Bryant,  who  was  born  near  Georgetown,  Scott  Co.,

emigrated  from  that  country  to  Quebec,  Canada,  in 
1828.  From  there  the  family  moved  to  Vermont, 
and  soon  after  to  Pennsylvania,  from  which  State 
about  four  years  later  they  moved  to  Franklin  Coun-

land,  and  subsequently  attained  an  enviable  position 
of  wealth.  In  1830  Thomas  West  began  the  trade  of 
stone-cutter  in  Beaver  County,  Penn. , where  he  was  em- 
ployed four  years.  He  next  spent  one  year  as  an

moved  down  the  Ohio  River  to  Cincinnati,  from 
which  cit}-  he  came  to  this  township,  where  he  has 
since  resided.  In  1847  Mr.  West  purchased  his  pres- 
ent farm  of  eighty  acres,  on  which  he  has  since  been 
toiling  for  the  improvement  of  his  worldly  interests.

in  Fayette  County,  in  the  year  1836.  He  is  a  son  of 
Samuel  and  Elizabeth  (Connoway)  Williamson,  who 
were  married  January  19,  1832,  and  had  a  family  of 
thirteen  children:  Adeline,  Elmon,  Franklin,  Madi-

Williamson  was  born  in  Ohio  July  3,  1807.  His 
parents  were  Moses  (born  in  Virginia  September  23, 
1774,)  and  Jane  (Riggs)  Williamson  (born  December 
25,  1778,)  who  had  only  one  child.  The  father  of 
our  subject,  Moses  Williamson,  was  a  man  of  good 
executive  ability,  and  held  for  several  years  the  office 
of  Justice  of  the  Peace.  During  the  war  of  1812- 
15  he  served  on  the  frontier.  He  died  January  5,

man  and  a  respected  citizen.  He  died  September  10, 
1855;  his  widow  died  November  27,  1884.  Our  sub- 
ject was  twice  married;  on  first  occasion,  in  1857,  to 
Martha,  daughter  of  David  Ross,  by  whom  he  had 
three  children:  Samuel,  Elsie,  David  (deceased  in

18,  1851,  in  North  Lebanon  Township,  Lebanon 
County,  Penn. ,  and  was  baptized  June  23,  1851;  she 
came  to  Indiana  in  1871;  is  a  member  of  the  Evan- 
gelical Methodist  Church.  By  this  union  there  is 
no  issue.  Mr.  Williamson  owns  seventy -five  acres  of 
land,  which  is  well  improved. 

FRANKLIN  M.  WORSHAM,  farmer,  Fairview 
Township,  was  born  in  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  April 
9,  1829,  son  of  Jeremiah  and  Nancy  (Fulliu)  Wor- 
sham,  who  were  among  the  first  settlers  of  this 
county.  His  father  was  born  in  1786  in  Washington 
County,  Va. ;  thence,  in  1811,  he  moved  to  Brook- 
ville,  Franklin  Co.,  Ind.,  and  the  same  year  en- 
tered land  and  settled  on  the  banks  of  Whitewater 
River,  two  miles  south  of  CQnnersville.  At  that 
time  Indiana  was  a  Territory.  There  were  but  few 
families  in  Connersville,  and  the  Indians  who  were 
encamped  in  the  river  bottoms  were  very  troublesome. 
Mr.  Worsham  was  married,  while  residing  on  this 
farm,  to  Nancy  Fullin,  a  native  of  Tennessee,  born 
in  1795,  and  who  came  with  her  parents  to  this 
county  in  1811.  To  this  union  were  born  William 
W.,  Elizabeth,  Ruth,  Malinda,  Samuel,  Robert,  John 
J.,  George  W.,  Franklin  M.,  Jeremiah,  Charles  W., 
Joseph  T.  and  Sarah.  Mr.  Worsham  resided  on  his 
farm  on  the  banks  of  the  Whitewater  about  ten  years, 
then  purchased  another  west  oF  Connersville,  where 
he  remained  until  his  death,  which  occurred  October 
20,  1861,  his  wife  having  preceded  him  July  16, 
1859.  He  owned  at  the  time  of  his  demise  over  500 
acres  of  land.  Franklin  M.,  our  subject,  was  married, 
in  Rush  County,  Ind.,  March  13,  1856,  to  Mary  S., 
daughter  of  Robert  H.  and  Jemima  (Messersmith) 
Newbould.  She  was  born  in  this  county  March  5, 
1835.  They  have  a  family  of  nine  children:  Armilda, 
Samantha  A.,  John  T.,  Robert  F.,  Martha  M.,  Albert 
H.  S.,  Alva  P.  B.,  William  M.  and  Daisy  E.  After 
our  subject's  marriage  he  settled  on  the  farm  where 
he  has  since  resided.  He  owns  at  present  about  200 
acres  of  excellent  land. 

JOSEPH  T.  WORSHAM,  farmer,  Connersville 
Township,  was  born  in  1835,  a  native  of  this  county, 
son  of  Jeremiah  and  Nancy  (Fullin)  Worsham,  who 
were  born  and  married  in  Virginia,  and  moved  to 
Franklin  County,  Ind.,  in  1811,  moving  to  this  county 
soon  after.     Here  the  father  died  in  1861,  the  mother 


having  preceded  him  in  1859.  Jeremiah  Worsham 
was  among  the  first  settlers  of  the  county,  a  successful 
and  wealthy  farmer,  owning  at  one  time  354  acres  of 
land.  Joseph  T.  Worsham,  the  subject  of  this 
sketch,  was  employed  at  home  on  the  farm  with  his 
pareats  until  he  was  twenty-five  years  of  age.  He 
obtained  a  practical  education  in  the  district  schools, 
and  made  farming  his  chief  occupation  through  life. 
In  1862  he  married  Sarah  Hartzel,  a  native  of  Penn- 
sylvania and  daughter  of  John  Hartzel,  and  two 
children  have  been  born  to  this  union:  Edwin  T.  and 
Oscar.  Mr.  Worsham  is  still  residing  on  the  old 
homestead  purchased  in  1861.  He  took  care  of  his 
parents  till  their  death,  thus  rewarding  them  for  their 
care  of  him  in  his  childhood  and  youth.  He  does  a 
general  farming  business,  and  has  on  his  farm  one  of 
the  finest  limestone  quarries  in  the  State,  and  this  he 
has  operated  quite  extensively.  In  politics  he  is  a 
Democrat. 

JAMES  WORSTER  (deceased),  late  of  Jen- 
nings Township,  was  born  December  31,  1782, 
in  Pennsylvania,  son  of  Rev.  Robert  and  Mary 
(Gorman)  Worster,  the  former  a  native  of  Eng- 
land, the  latter  of  German  descent.  Rev.  Robert 
Worster  came  to  Indiana  some  time  after  his  son 
James.  It  is  said  that  he  preached  the  first  Method- 
ist sermon  delivered  west  of  the  Alleghenies.  He 
was  a  forcible  preacher,  whose  labors  ended  only  with 
his  life.  He  also  taught  the  first  school  in  Jennings 
Township.  His  children,  eight  in  number,  were 
Sarah,  Daniel,  James,  Margaret,  Hugh,  Nellie,  Jennie 
and  Thomas.  He  died  in  1830,  aged  one  hundred 
and  one  years;  his  widow  in  1832,  aged  seventy-five. 
Our  subject  went  with  his  parents  to  Bracken  County, 
Ky.,  where  he  was  married,  August  8,  1805,  to 
Nancy  Milner,  born  in  Kentucky  September  1,  1789, 
daughter  of  Amos  and  Hannah  (Rice)  Milner,  of 
Pennsylvania,  who  settled  in  Bracken  County,  Ky.,  in 
an  early  day,  and  in  1819  moved  thence  to  Fayette 
County,  Ind.  They  were  parents  of  three  children: 
Sarah  (wife  of  Elijah  Corbin),  John  and  Nancy. 
Amos  Milner  was  one  of  the  heroes  of  the  Revolu- 
tionary war.  He  died  September  1,  1851,  aged 
ninety-one  years,  one  month  and  twenty-two  days. 
He  and  his  wife  were  members  of  the  Methodist 
Church.  In  1814  Mr.  and  Mrs.  James  Worster,  with 
their  three  children,  moved  to  Indiana  Territory, 
selecting  a  location  in  what  is  now  Jennings  Town- 
ship. (Before  settling  here  Mr.  Worster  had  served 
in  the  war  of  1812-15).  They  had  nine  children: 
Hannah,  Mary  J.,  Amos  M.,  Robert,  John  O.,  Sarah 
E.,  Lucinda  A.,  Thomas  W.,  Elizabeth  M.  Mr. 
Worster  died  September  29,  1849;  his  widow  Septem- 
ber 24,  1876,  aged  eighty-seven  years  and  twenty-three 
days.   They  were  members  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal

THOMAS  WRIGHT,  Columbia  Township,  is, 
perhaps,  the  oldest  resident  of  this  county  living  at 
this  date.  He  was  born  in  Gloucester  County,  Va., 
October  11,  1793,  and  is  of  English  and  French  par- 
entage. His  parents,  Thomas  and  Mary  (Pointer) 
Wright,  were  born  in  England,  both  dying  when 
he  was  but  a  child,  and  he  was  reared  to  the 
age  of  sixteen  by  an  elder  brother.  He  then 
began  a  sea-faring  life,  embarking  on  a  vessel 
owned  by  John  Gressett.  He  continued  on  the  wave 
about  thirteen  years,  being  promoted  from  one  posi- 
tion to  another  till  he  became  Captain  of  a  vessel  of 
his  own,  which  same  ship  was  used  by  the  citizens  of 
Yorktown  on  the  occasion  of  welcoming  LaFayette 
when  on  one  of  his  visits  to  this  country.  It  was  also 
honored  by  the  presence  of  the  celebrated  Irish  poet, 
Thomas  Moore,  who  was  one  of  its  jiassengers  while 
on  his  tour  to  the  United  States.  Mr.  Wright  was 
married,  June  5,  1822,  to  Catharine  W.  Stubbs,  a 
native  of  Gloucester  County,  Va.,  born  July  20, 1805, 
daughter  of  Francis  and  Ann  (Hall)  Stubbs,  of 
English  and  French  descent  respectively.  Her  grand- 
father was  born  in  England  find  married  there.  Her 
maternal  grandmother  was  named  Mildred  Du  Vail. 
Her  parents  were  married  in  Gloucester  County,  Va. 
and  reared  two  children,  Mrs.  Wright  being  a  daugh- 
ter by  her  father's  second  wife  (his  first  wife  was  a 
Miss  Robbins,  by  whom  he  had  one  son).  Her  father 
died  in  Virginia  before  she  was  born,  and  her  mother 
died  in  this  State  in  1853.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Wright  have 
four  children  living:  Matilda,  Laura,  Willa  A.  and 
Julia  E.  Soon  after  his  marriage  Mr.  Wright  gave 
up  the  life  of  a  sailor,  sold  his  vessel,  and  settled 
down  to  the  peaceful  pursuit  of  agriculture  in  Vir- 
ginia. In  1837  they  sold  their  property  there  and 
moved  to  this  county,  where  Mr.  Wright  purchased 
his  present  farm.  Here  he  has  since  resided  and 
played  his  part  in  the  great  drama  of  life.    His  facul- 


ties were  well  preserved  till  recently,  but  nature  has 
run  its  course,  and  the  vital  forces  are  well-nigh  spent. 
Ninety  years  have  sufficed  to  dim  the  eye,  dull  the 
ear  and  enfeeble  the  mind;  and  a  few  more  years 
must  end  the  long  eventful  race. 

HENRY  M.  WRIGHT  (deceased),  formerly  of 
Orange  Township,  and  latterly  of  Glenwood,  Rush 
Co.,  Ind.,  an  old  and  well -respected  pioneer  of  Fay-

ty, Penn.,  where  the  former  was  born  May  21,  1789, 
and  the  latter  March  9, 1799.  Justice  was  the  second

moved  to  Fayette  County,  Ind.,  settling  five  miles 
southwest  of  Connersville,  on  what  is  known  as  Fall 
Creek,  where  he  lived  the  balance  of  his  days.  His 
second  wife  died  October  14,  1827,  and  on  March  20, 
1828,  he  married  Mary,  daughter  of  John  and  Eliza- 
beth Dailey,  and  who  died  June  10, 1847.  He  died  Feb- 
ruary 22,  1873,  having  had  five  children — by  his  first 
wife,  Sarah,  John  and  Rachel,  and  by  his  second  mar- 
riage Ephraim  and  Henry  M.  (our  subject).  Justice 
Wright  was  a  man  highly  respected  by  all.  He  was 
a  zealous  and  devoted  member  of  the  Baptist  Church, 
and  during  his  life  held  many  offices  of  trust.  He 
was  one  of  the  first  Justices  of  the  Peace  of  the  county, 
and  served  about  twenty  years  as  Probate  Judge. 
Our  subject  came  with  his  father  to  this  county  when 
about  two  years  of  age,  and  here  spent  the  greater 
part  of  his  life.  He  was  married  in  Mason  County, 
111.,  May  16,  1852,  to  Lucy  A.,  born  August  6,  1831, 
daughter  of  Lorenzo  R.  and  Jane  (Eddy)  Hastings. 
Immediately  after  marriage  he  returned  with  his  wife 
to  this  count}%  and  settled  on  his  father's  old  home- 
stead until  the  latter's  death;  then  purchased  the 
farm,  and  there  remained  until  November,  1882,  when 
he  moved  to  Glenwood,  Rush  Co.,  Ind.,  where  he 
resided  up  to  the  day  of  his  death.  His  first  wife 
died  December  19,  1856,  and  he  was  married,  August 
1,  1878,  to  Sarah  J.,  daughter  of  William  S.  and 
Nancy  (Martin)  Brown,  who  \yas  born  at  Conners- 
ville, Ind.,  November  30,  1843.  He  was  the  father 
of  three  children:  William  J.  (deceased),  and  James 
L.  by  first  wife,  and  Martin  B.  by  last  marriage.  Mr. 
Wright  had  suffered  much  from  childhood  with  a 
diseased  limb,  pronounced  at  first  to  be  white  swell-

ing,  which  ultimately  necessitated  amputation,  and 
this  was.  performed  at  his  own  desire  in  November, 
1884,  four  experienced  surgeons  being  in  attendance, 
but  the  patient  had  not  sufficient  vitality  to  sur- 
vive the  operation,  and  he  sank  to  rest,  after  thirteen 
days  intense  suffering,  December  3,  1884  Mr. 
Wright  was  not  a  member  of  any  church  or  any  Soci- 
ety, but  was  withal  a  true  Christian  and  a  strong 
temperance  man.  In  politics  he  was  a  Republican. 
His  remains  are  interred  in  the  cemetery  at  Connera- 
ville,  Fayette  Co.,  Ind.
