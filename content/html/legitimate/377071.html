      In 1840, I am told, Henry and Mary
      and their
      two children fled Ireland because they
      had
      hidden a Catholic priest who was wanted
      by
      the British authorities. The Browns
      landed
      at Tracadie, New Brunswick, Canada.
      Their
      goal was Ashfield Township in Ontario
      and
      one can only speculate on the difficulty
      of their long and ardous journey from
      New
      Brunswick to Ontario to Ashfield Township
      and finally locating near the town
      of Goderich.<BR>
      <BR>
      In the 1851 Ontario, Canada, Huron
      County,
      Ashfield Township agricultural census,*
      Henry
      and his family are reported to hold
      100 acres.
      Ten of these acres are under cultivation.
      Ninety acres are said to be under wool
      or
      wild. Henry had four acres in wheat
      which
      produced twenty bushels, one acre in
      potatoes
      which produced thirty bushels. The
      land produced
      six bundles or tons of hay, the sheep
      produced
      twenty-two pounds of wool which made
      forty
      eight yards of flannel (Annie Brown
      Stack
      had a spinning wheel in her home and
      must
      have well known how to use it). Henry
      had
      five oxen, nine milk cows, one calf,
      eleven
      sheep, six pigs and no horses. The
      family
      made one hundred pounds of butter in
      1851
      and salted away four barrels of pork.
      Their
      home is listed as being a one story
      log shanty.
      In 1851 there were eleven people in
      the Brown
      family. Four more children, including
      Annie
      Brown Stack, came later. It would be
      interesting
      to know the dimensions of the log house.<BR>
      <BR>
      During the lumber and mining boom in
      the
      Upper Peninsula, Henry and Mary moved
      their
      family to Negaunee, Michigan (1867).
      Henry
      farmed, built log cabins, was a blacksmith
      and was able to make plows and door
      hardware
      for the cabins. He also did mine timbering.
      In the book, &quot;Spring of Gladness&quot;
      by Mary Brown McGonigal (Henry's granddaughter),
      there are several proud and fond references
      to the skills of Henry Brown. He passed
      these
      skills onto his children. Mary mentions
      on
      p. 120 that in the spring of 1883,
      her father,
      Michael, asked his parents to send
      him some
      hardwood tree slips. Henry and Mary
      packed
      and sent them from Northern Michigan
      to Idaho.
      Michael planted them on the two banks
      of
      his new ditch running east and west
      along
      the north boundary of his acreage.
      When Mary
      Brown McGonigal wrote her book in 1975,
      it
      was still a beautiful grove of trees.<BR>
      <BR>
      My Grandmother, Annie Brown Stack,
      too, spoke
      lovingly of her parents and truly appreciated
      their hard work and accomplishments.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      In 1886, Mary and Henry moved to Iron
      Mountain,
      Michigan to be near three of their
      daughters
      and many grandchildren.<BR>
      <BR>
      Henry died June 29, 1890 at 90 years
      of age.
      He is buried in the Catholic cemetery
      in
      Quinnesec, Michigan, Block 1, Lot #1.<BR>

      <FONT color="#ffff00"><span class="auto-style3">Mary Clayton Brown</span></FONT><FONT color="#ffff00" size="+2" class="auto-style3"> was born in Wales in 1815. We do not know
      the first name of her father, but according
      to Annie Brown Stack, he was the captain
      of a whaling ship. Her mother's maiden name
      was Hoare (pronounced hair). While she was
      still very young, both Mary's parents were
      lost at sea. Mary was sent to live with her
      mother's sister in Ireland, attended a convent
      school and was adept at languages. Mary and
      Henry Brown were married when she was sixteen
      and he was thirty-one years old. They had
      sixteen children, twelve of whom grew to
      adulthood: John W (1837), Henry (1838), Michael
      (1839), Mary (1842), Elizabeth (1844), Nora
      Peter (1845), Julia (1847), Joseph (1849)
      Annie (1850), Margaret (1851) and Hannah
      (1853).<BR>
      <BR>
      Annie Brown Stack often spoke lovingly
      of
      her parents. She had many skills which
      must
      have been learned from them. I would
      imagine
      that with such a large family and living
      on a farm, there was more then enough
      work
      for all. Margaret Stack Dundon told
      her daughter,
      Margaret, that Mary was a wonderful
      storyteller
      and young and old enjoyed being around
      her.<BR>
      <BR>
      John Brown, Mary and Henry's oldest
      son,
      and his wife, Mary McKenna Brown, had
      a farm
      in Idaho on land joining Michael Brown's.
      In 1888, Mary died of pneumonia and
      in 1890.
      Nora, the youngest of their five children,
      died of the same illness. John was
      heartbroken
      and depressed over these losses and
      according
      to the book &quot;Spring of Gladness&quot;
      by Mary McGonigal Brown, his health
      failed
      and he died March 3, 1891. The four
      surviving
      children were Minnie age 19, Frank
      18, Sarah
      14, and Katharine 8. Mary Clayton Brown
      insisted
      they come to her even though she was
      alone.
      Henry had died in 1890. Having been
      orphaned
      herself while very young, she must
      have felt
      that she could best take care of them.
      Frank
      opted to stay and work the farm but
      the three
      girls went to their grandmothers and
      remained
      with her until her death. They eventually
      married and had families of their own.<BR>
      <BR>
      Mary died September 15, 1898. The following
      appeared in the Iron Mountain Press
      on Thursday
      September 22, 1898:<BR>

      a
      resident of this city for 12 years,

      a most estimable lady. She was the

      Dad and I and your Aunts, Mary and
      Ruthie,
      visited the Browns' grave in 1985.
      Mary Brown's
      gravestone had been broken in half.
      We drove
      to Iron Mountain for epoxy glue and
      Dad repaired
      it.<BR>

      Some notes about the Clayton, Hoare,
      and
      DesBrisay families<BR>
      <BR>
      I have tried hard to find a record
      of Mary's
      parents being lost at sea. Lloyd's
      of London
      referred me to the Guildhall Library
      in London
      where their early records are kept.
      The library
      wrote &quot;whaling was an isolated
      and dangerous
      activity and numerous vessels disappeared
      without trace.&quot; Lloyd's did not
      begin
      to keep lists of such missing vessels
      until
      1873. Dad and I spent an afternoon
      at the
      Library of Congress going through &quot;Lloyd's
      Lists&quot; of the right period and
      found
      both owners and &quot;Masters&quot;
      by the
      name of Clayton and Hoare. Mary must
      have
      come from a truly &quot;seafaring family.&quot;<BR>
      <BR>
      While in Pembroke, Wales in 1991, I
      checked
      the South Wales telephone book for
      Claytons
      and Hoares. There were fifty-two Claytons
      and forty-one Hoares listed in South
      Wales.
      Pembroke is a an old harbor town and
      nearby
      a major British navy presence has existed
      for hundreds of years. I cannot help
      but
      wonder if this might be where the Claytons
      lived.<BR>
      <BR>
      In the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica,
      there
      is reference to an 1883 &quot;History
      of
      the Hoare or Hore Family&quot; by Edward
      Hoare. It is on microfilm at the Library
      of Congress and recently I made a copy
      of
      it.<BR>
      <BR>
      The Hoares are an ancient family and
      came
      to England with William the Conqueror
      from
      Normandy. The word Hoare means a boundary
      marker or it can mean the color white
      as
      in hoarfrost. There was a knight by
      this
      name whose suit of armor was white
      and was
      known as &quot;the White Knight.&quot;
      In
      the 12th century, members of this substantial
      and prolific family settled in Pembrokeshire,
      South Wales or Dyfed which is its ancient
      name. There were so many English people
      in
      the area that it was sometimes called
      &quot;Little
      England.&quot; The Hoares accumulated
      an
      impressive amount of land and held
      various
      public offices, sheriff, representatives
      in Parliament, etc. Some of this name
      participated
      in the conquest of Ireland, including
      the
      &quot;White Knight&quot; and then settled
      in Wexford and Cork. In later years
      many
      were officers in the British occupying
      army,
      ministers in the Church of Ireland,
      bankers,
      lawyers and so on. For generations
      they were
      part of the privileged British occupying
      Ireland and Wales.<BR>
      <BR>
      Our 1991 trip to the British Isles
      and Ireland
      reminded us of the many civilizations
      that
      have existed there. The Celts and their
      amazing
      piles of stones; the Romans (in England
      500
      years), and their 5000 miles of roads,
      their
      walls and baths; the Vikings (there
      200 years)
      with the many cities they established
      and
      named still thriving, plus the red
      headed
      individuals who may be reminders of
      the genes
      these people left behind; the Normans
      and
      the castles they built to protect themselves
      from other marauders and the locals;
      the
      wretch Cromwell and his armies; and
      the way
      each of these groups seem to have smashed
      as much as they could the building
      efforts
      of those who came before. <BR>
      <BR>
      It took the Irish a long time to get
      rid
      of the British and those citizens who
      did
      not wish to become Roman Catholic and
      truly
      Irish. In many towns, Church of Ireland
      (Anglican)
      buildings still remain symbolic targets
      and
      are seen one after another closed and
      chained
      or worse. The dear little church in
      Waterford,
      formerly St. Patrick's, in which Theophilus
      DesBrisay received his priests orders
      was
      sold to the Presbyterian Church and
      has been
      bombed twice. Many of.the palatial
      homes
      built by wealthy British belong to
      others,
      the public buildings belong to Ireland.
      The
      Georgian doors of Dublin have been
      painted
      brilliant colors and are identified
      with
      the Irish but the ancient St. Patrick's
      and
      Christ Church Cathedrals are some of
      the
      very visible reminders of the 700 year
      occupation.<BR>
      <BR>
      Four generations of DesBrisays lived
      in Ireland.
      For three generations, they were officers
      in the British army as were others
      of your
      Huguenot ancestors. At different times
      they
      were stationed at Cork Hill (now called
      Dublin
      Castle) in Dublin. Cork Hill is an
      installation
      that must have been then like our Pentagon.
      The castle stands damaged but is now
      being
      repaired and is in use. Another way
      of life,
      another civilization &quot;bit the
      dust&quot;
      and you had forebears on both sides,
      the
      privileged and the downtrodden.</FONT><BR class="auto-style4">
