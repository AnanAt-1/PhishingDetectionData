146  ECONOMY  AND   EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 


PUBLISHED   RECORDS    OF   THE   MASSACHUSETTS    MILITIA 
WHO  SERVED   IN   THE  WAR   OF   1812-14. 

On  April  27,  1914,  the  commission  submitted  to  the  Governor 
a  preliminary  draft  of  a  report  on  the  work  of  the  Adjutant- 
General's  office  in  connection  with  the  compilation  and  publica- 
tion of  the  records  of  the  Massachusetts  militia  who  served  in 
the  war  of  1812-14.  An  investigation  of  this  work  was  under- 
taken as  a  result  of  charges  made  to  the  Commission  on  Econ- 
omy and  Efficiency  by  a  private  citizen  of  the  Commonwealth, 
who  questioned  the  legality  of  expenditures  made  for  the  compila- 
tion and  publication  of  the  records.  Questions  were  also  raised 
as  to  whether  the  cost  of  the  work  was  excessive  and  whether  a 
compilation  of  the  records  was  actually  made  in  accordance  with 
the  provisions  of  the  law  authorizing  the  work.  With  regard  to 
the  legality  of  expenditures,  the  Auditor  held  that  the  payments 
in  question  were  legally  made.  The  nature  and  reliability  of  the 
published  records  and  the  cost  of  the  work  were  discussed  fully 
in  the  preliminary  report  submitted  to  the  Governor  in  .\pril, 
and  are  briefly  considered  here.  Material  collected  during  this 
investigation,  including  correspondence  with  former  State  offi- 
cials, copies  of  old  letters  found  in  the  military  archives,  memo- 
randa relative  to  old  records,  stenographic  reports  of  interviews, 
etc.,  are  on  file  in  this  office. 

The  publication  of  the  records  of  the  militia  was  advocated 
by  the  Massachusetts  Society  of  the  War  of  1812,  members  of 
which  petitioned  the  Legislature  of  1911  for  such  publication. 
The  committee  on  military  affairs  reported  against  the  bill 
mainly  because  no  one  could  inform  them  concerning  the  probable 
cost  of  the  publication.  In  1912  a  similar  petition  was  filed  and 
upon  advices  received  from  the  Adjutant-General  that  the 
probable  cost  of  such  work  would  not  exceed  $6,500  the  Legis- 
lature authorized  the  publication.  The  estimate  submitted  by 
the  Adjutant-General  was  made  for  him  by  the  custodian  of  the 
military  archives,  whose  statement  to  the  Adjutant-General  was 
in  part  as  follows:  — 

As  a  matter  of  sentiment,  permit  me  to  say  that  in  1912  legislation 
should  be  had  for  the  publishing  of  the  records  of  the  war  of  1812,  and 
completed  in  1914,  as  the  service  performed  by  the  Massachusetts  troops 
was  in  1814.  If  no  extra  lielp  was  employed,  the  work  could  be  done 
outside  of  office  hours  by  two  indexing  clerks  and  myself,  three  in  all, 
at  such  compensation  as  you  might  recommend.     I  should  therefore 


191.-1.]  PUBLIC   DOCUMENT  — No.  96.  147 

judge  tliiit  .$3,000  was  ample  in  addition  to  the  $3,500, '  —  total  of  $6,500, 
—  but  should  extra  help  be  employed,  the  cost  woidd  naturally  he  more, 
double  if  not  triple. 

This  haphazard  estimate,  that  .$3,000  in  the  way  of  additional 
compensation  for  the  custodian  and  the  two  clerks  in  his  office 
"was  ample  in  addition  to  the  $3,500"  estimated  printing  cost, 
was  the  basis  for  the  authorization  of  the  work.  The  compila- 
tion of  the  records  was  authorized  by  chapter  81  of  the  Resolves 
of  1912,  which  reads  as  follows:  — 

Resolved,  That  the  adjutant  general  i.s  autliorized  and  directed  to  pre- 
pare a  compilation  of  the  records  of  the  militia  who  responded  to  the  call 
of  the  governor  of  the  commonwealth  to  repel  a  threatened  invasion 
during  the  war  of  eighteen  hundred  and  twelve,  as  the  same  are  found 
in  the  archives  in  the  office  of  the  adjutant  general.  The  said  work  shall 
Ije  done  solely  under  the  direction  of  tlie  adjutant  general  and  shall  be 
completed  within  one  year  after  the  passage  of  this  resolve. 

Under  the  provisions  of  chapter  71S  of  the  Acts  of  1912  the 
sum  of  $6,500  was  appropriated  "for  the  publication  of  certain 
state  military  records  of  the  war  of  eighteen  hundred  and  twelve, 
as  authorized  by  chapter  eighty-one  of  the  resolves  of  the  present 
year,"  although  in  fact  no  specific  authorization  for  publication 
was  given  in  the  resolve. 

The  legislation  authorized  a  compilation  of  the  records,  "as 
the  same  are  found  in  the  archives  in  the  office  of  the  adjutant 
general."  For  historical  purposes  the  records  remaining  in  the 
archives  are  of  doubtful  value,  since  nearly  all  original  records 
were  sent  to  Washington  in  1823  as  vouchers  for  payments  made 
by  the  Federal  government.  If  this  fact  had  been  properly 
called  to  the  attention  of  the  committee  on  military  affairs  it  is 
the  belief  of  this  commission  that  no  legislation  authorizing  the 
publication  of  the  records  in  the  archives  would  have  been 
enacted.  Although  the  committee  on  military  affairs  was  given 
seme  information  concerning  the  records  in  the  archives  division, 
it  is  understood  that  no  emphasis  was  laid  upon  the  fact  that 
the  records  were  neither  original  records  nor  certified  copies  of 
the  original. 

The  records  in  the  archives  division  consist  of  a  volume  and 
inde.\  known  as  the  "Rolls  of  the  Massachusetts  Militia  in  the 
War  of  18^2-14,"  and  a  volume  containing  "Additional  Rolls  of 

*  For  printing. 


148  ECONOMY  AND  EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 

Troops  in  Service,  1812-14."  In  1878  an  appropriation  not 
exceeding  $1,000  was  made  (under  the  provisions  of  chapter  283 
of  the  acts)  for  obtaining  these  rolls.  They  were  purchased  in 
the  same  year  for  the  sum  of  $1,000  from  one  Damon  E.  Cheney 
of  Orange,  Mass.,  who  was  an  agent  of  the  Pension  Bureau.  In 
1882  the  sum  of  $200  was  paid  Z.  K.  Harmon  for  work  done  in 
connection  with  these  records.  In  the  published  work  contain- 
ing these  records  the  name  of  Z.  K.  Harmon  appears  as  compiler. 
These  rolls  were  made  from  certain  documents  in  Washington, 
but  whether  they  were  made  from  originals,  or  whether  they 
were  complete,  or  whether  the  Harmon  copy  was  correct,  could 
not  be  determined  by  the  Adjutant-General  in  1913.  The  Adju- 
tant-General first  took  steps  to  ascertain  what  the  records  con- 
sisted of,  and  also  to  determine  their  authenticity  in  March, 
1913,  when  he  directed  a  letter  to  Gen.  A.  Hun  Berry,  who  was 
Adjutant-General  of  Massachusetts  in  1881,  but  he  was  able  to 
furnish  only  meager  information.  The  Adjutant-General  should 
have  made  careful  inquiry  into  the  reliability  of  the  records 
before  the  work  was  started,  and  his  failure  to  take  action  until 
March,  1913 — subsequent  to  the  completion  of  the  compila- 
tion —  is  the  strongest  criticism  of  the  laxity  characterizing  the 
conduct  of  the  work.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  work 
the  custodian  had  informed  the  Adjutant-General  as  to  the  nature 
of  the  records  in  the  military  archives. 

The  Adjutant-General  has  claimed  that  the  publication  is  a 
compilation  of  the  records,  "  as  the  same  are  found  in  the 
archives."  This  is  largely  true,  but  such  a  claim  does  not  alter 
the  fact  that  the  compilation  is  unreliable  from  a  historical 
standpoint.  Moreover,  in  answer  to  a  letter  from  the  Adjutant- 
General,  the  War  Department  wrote,  on  Feb.  3,  1914,  that 
"  nothing  is  known  in  this  office  with  regard  to  the  book  in 
question,'  nor  as  to  the  source  from  which  the  data  in  it  were 
obtained.  The  only  way  in  which  it  could  be  determined  whether 
or  not  the  compilation  is  authentic  would  be  to  compare  the 
entries  in  the  book,  name  by  name,  with  the  official  records." 

The  published  report  is  but  a  copy  of  the  "Harmon  book" 
slightly  rearranged,  with  the  addition  of  a  very  small  amount  of 
material  taken  from  other  papers  in  the  archives  division,  and 
may  be  correctly  described  as  merely  a  new  edition  of  that 
compilation.  No  person  can  be  found  who  will  vouch  for  the 
authenticity  of  the  publication.

1915.]  PUBLIC  DOCUMENT  — No.  96.  149 

The  three  clerks  working  on  the  compilation  received  a  total 
of  12,785.20  as  compensation,  the  custodian  receiving  $1,266 
and  the  two  clerks  $759.60  each.  Payments  were  not  made  to 
the  clerks  periodically  during  the  progress  of  the  work,  but  a 
single  bill  covering  the  total  amount  claimed  for  each  clerk  was 
submitted  and  settled  in  lump-sum  payments  upon  completion 
of  the  work.  These  amounts  were  paid  as  extra  compensation, 
on  the  assumption  that  the  work  was  performed  outside  of 
office  hours.  No  record  of  the  time  spent  on  the  work  was  kept, 
the  custodian  simply  checking  off  dates  on  an  old  calendar  on 
his  desk.  The  bills  for  services  of  the  three  clerks  were  sub- 
mitted for  eight  hundred  and  forty-four  hours  each,  which  the 
custodian  claimed  was  much  less  than  the  actual  work  time, 
although  the  watchmen's  records  of  time  of  departure  from  the 
State  House,  as  kept  in  the  sergeant-at-arm's  office,  show  only 
about  four  hundred  and  fifty  hours.  No  reports  of  time  con- 
sumed, expense  or  progress  of  work  were  made  by  the  custodian 
to  the  Adjutant-General  during  the  work,  none  being  required. 

With  reference  to  the  compensation  to  be  paid  the  clerks,  the 
Adjutant-General  at  first  believed  that  a  sum  equal  to  the  annual 
salary  of  the  clerks  engaged  upon  the  work  should  be  paid,  but 
the  appropriation  would  not  allow  of  this,  so  the  clerks  were 
paid  for  eight  hundred  and  forty-four  hours  at  a  rate  double 
their  regular  compensation,  giving  the  custodian  $1.50  an  hour 
and  each  of  the  two  clerks  90  cents  an  hour. 

The  commission  believes  that  a  daily  record  .should  have  been 
kept  by  these  three  clerks  showing  the  actual  time  employed  on 
this  work  and  the  amount  of  work  accomplished,  and  that  re- 
ports based  on  this  record  should  have  been  submitted  at  stated 
periods  to  the  Adjutant-General.  The  method  of  determining 
the  rate  of  compensation  was  arbitrary,  since  neither  the  nature 
nor  quantity  of  the  work  was  considered,  but  merely  the  amount 
of  the  appropriation  which  might  be  used  for  this  purpose.  It 
is  the  opinion  of  the  commission  that  the  work  would  have 
been  accomplished  in  much  less  time  and  with  better  results  if 
clerks  had  been  employed  exclusively  on  this  work  during  regu- 
lar office  hours  and  under  competent  supervision. 

In  conclusion,  the  commission  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  pub- 
lished records  are  of  doubtful  value,  and  that  the  cost  of  com- 
pilation was  grosslj'  excessive.  Responsibility  foi  the  proper 
conduct  of  the  work  rested  upon  the  then  Adjutant-General  as 
head  of  the  office,  while  immediate  charge  of  the  work  was  in- 


150  ECONOMY  AND  EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 

trusted  to  the  custodian  of  the  mihtary  archives.  Both  officials 
appear  to  be  open  to  criticism  in  connection  with  this  work. 
No  recommendation  for  action  appears  to  be  indicated,  in  view 
of  the  fact  that  the  official  then  serving  as  Adjutant-General  no 
longer  holds  that  position,  and  in  view  of  the  further  fact  that 
the  retirement  of  the  custodian  of  the  military  archives  has 
been  recommended  in  a  report  on  the  "Business  Administration 
of  the  Militia,"  submitted  to  the  Governor  by  this  commission. 
The  custodian's  part  in  the  compilation  and  publication  of  the 
records  of  the  militia  in  the  war  of  1812-14  shows  most  em- 
phatically the  urgency  ol  his  early  retirement  from  the  State 
service. 


REPORT    ON    ALLEGED     IMPROPER     SELLING     METHODS 
USED  BY  THE  MASSACHUSETTS  COMMISSION  FOR  THE 

BLIND. 

Oct.  19,  1914. 

His  Excellency  the  Govenwr  and  the  Executive  Council. 

Sirs:  —  Action  was  taken  before  the  Commission  on  Economy 
and  Efficiency  initially  on  June  26,  1914,  in  form  of  protest  and 
petition  instituted  by  Joseph  L.  Cohen  of  New  York,  alleging, 
in  general,  unfair  methods  of  business  administration  main- 
tained by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  in  the 
distribution  and  sale  of  a  so-called  commodity,  known  as  the 
"Wundermop."  In  particular,  it  was  alleged  that  methods  now 
maintained  by  the  Commission  for  the  Blind  in  the  distribution 
and  sale  of  the  mop  in  New  York  City,  and  in  territory  outside 
of  Massachusetts,  constitute  a  monopoly  and  are  in  restraint  of 
trade.  It  was  further  alleged  that  refusal  of  the  commission  to 
sell  the  Wundermop  to  a  resident  of  Massachusetts  (the  Tate 
Manufacturing  Company)  constitutes  a  discrimination  which  is, 
in  substance,  a  violation  of  the  Massachusetts  statutes  affecting 
such  commission.  Subsequent  to  date  above  mentioned  confer- 
ences were  held  in  the  office  of  this  commission  with  Simon 
Cohen  of  counsel  for  petitioner,  and  with  Chairman  ]Munroe  of 
the  Commission  for  the  Blind. 

Under  date  of  Aug.  26,  1914,  Joseph  L.  Cohen,  hereinafter 
known  as  the  petitioner,  through  counsel,  formally  requested  a 
public  hearing  upon  matters  set  forth  in  protest  and  petition. 
This  request  was  honored  on  Sept.  3,  1914,  when  there  were 
present  at  such  hearing  several  parties  in  interest  to  the  contro- 


1915.]  PUBLIC  DOCUMENT  — Xo.  96.  151 

versy.  Subsequent  to  the  hearing,  and  under  date  of  Septem- 
ber S,  counsel  for  petitioner  filed  with  this  commission  requests 
for  findings  of  fact,  and  such  were  taken  under  advisement. 

The  undisputed  facts  appear  to  be  as  follows:  during  the 
latter  part  of  the  year  1908  the  Commission  for  the  Blind,  acting 
through  its  distributing  agent,  George  S.  Mansfield,  efl'ected  a 
sample  order  sale  of  Wunderniops  with  the  Board  of  Education 
of  the  city  of  New  York.  Subsequent  to  this  transaction,  and 
upon  receipt  of  several  telegraphic  orders  for  quantities  of  such 
mops,  the  commission,  through  its  agent,  IMr.  Mansfield,  made 
an  oral  agreement  with  Samuel  Lewis  of  New  York  City,  from 
whom  the  first  telegraphic  order  was  received.  Mr.  Lewis  is  a 
dealer  in  janitor  and  hospital  supplies  in  the  city  of  New  York, 
and  conducts  an  extensive  business  in  New  York  City  and  con- 
tiguous territory.  By  the  provisions  of  the  agreement  made  be- 
tween the  Commission  for  the  Blind  and  Mr.  Lewis,  the  latter 
was  to  act  as  the  exclusive  agent  for  the  commission  in  the  dis- 
tribution of  Wunderniops  in  the  city  of  New  York,  and  in  terri- 
tories outside  of  Massachusetts  not  otherwise  covered  by  exclu- 
sive agencies.  Sales  of  the  Wundermop  subsequently  increased 
in  material  manner  through  the  activities  of  Mr.  Lewis,  and 
through  the  energy,  as  well,  of  a  selling  agent  in  his  employ,  one 
Joseph  L.  Cohen  of  New  York,  otherwise  known  as  petitioner 
in  the  matter  now  before  the  commission. 

It  was  understood  between  the  Commission  for  the  Blind  and 
Mr.  Lewis,  and  made  a  part  of  the  agreement  between  the 
parties,  that  said  Lewis  should  use  his  discretion  in  the  matter 
of  sales  of  the  mop,  and  that  he  might  sell  or  refuse  to  sell  to 
such  parties  as  he  saw  fit.  It  is  also  a  fact  that  in  eft'ecting 
sales  of  the  Wundermop  to  parties  in  the  city  of  New  York  and 
elsewhere,  Mr.  Lewis  established  certain  restrictions  which  were 
drastic,  and  which  eliminated  the  possibility  of  sales  to  dealers 
competing  with  I\Ir.  Lewis  in  the  sale  of  the  Wundermop. 

In  the  latter  part  of  the  year  1911  petitioner  left  the  employ  of 
iMr.  Lewis,  subsequently  engaging  himself  in  the  business  of  pro- 
viding janitor,  hotel  and  hospital  supplies,  and  constituting 
himself  sole  proprietor  of  the  Standard  Supply  Company,  so 
called,  of  New  York  City.  By  the  nature  of  the  business  insti- 
tuted by  petitioner,  he  became,  theoretically,  an  active  competi- 
tor with  Samuel  Lewis  in  the  sale  and  distribution  of  the  Wunder- 
mop. It  appears  that  at  no  time  has  Mr.  Lewis  sold  any  of  the 
^^  undermops  to  petitioner,   and   it   is   also  evident   that   no  pro- 


152  ECONOMY  AND  EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 

posals  made  by  petitioner  for  the  purcha*se  of  such  mops  have 
ever  been  favorably  considered  by  said  Lewis.  Unable  to  pur- 
chase mops  from  Mr.  Lewis,  and  obtaining  limited  quantities  of 
the  commodity  through  third  parties,  petitioner  endeavored  to 
purchase  direct  from  the  commission  in  Boston,  and  indirectly 
from  said  commission  through  the  Tate  Manufacturing  Companj^ 
a  Boston  concern.  Both  attempts  were  unsuccessful.  Offers  for 
the  purchase  of  quantities  of  mops  made  by  petitioner  to  the 
Commission  for  the  Blind  were  refused  upon  the  ground  that 
petitioner,  a  resident  of  New  York  City,  should  purchase  through 
the  commission's  agent,  Mr.  Lewis  of  New  York.  Offers  of 
purchase  made  by  the  Tate  Manufacturing  Company  were 
acceptable  to  the  commission,  but  when  inquiry  was  made  by 
that  body  as  to  the  ultimate  destination  of  mops,  and  such  not 
forthcoming  from  the  Tate  Manufacturing  Company,  the  offer 
by  this  concern  was  refused.  This  refusal  was  based  upon  the 
peculiar  knowledge  of  the  commission  that  the  Tate  Manufactur- 
ing Company  was  to  all  intents  and  purposes  an  agent  of  peti- 
tioner. Refusal  of  the  commission  to  sell  to  the  Tate  Manu- 
facturing Company  in  this  instance  was,  as  stated  by  ofHcials  of 
the  commission,  based  entirely  upon  the  aim  of  the  commission 
to  protect  its  selling  agent,  Mr.  Lewis,  in  territory  assigned  to 
him. 

It  appears  that  a  marked  feeling  of  unfriendliness  has  existed 
between  Mr.  Lewis  and  the  petitioner,  and  this  condition  has 
apparently  accentuated  a  situation  otherwise  possible  of  allevia- 
tion. It  further  appears  that  a  mop,  in  all  but  one  essential 
identical  with  the  patented  Wundermop  article,  and  manu- 
factured by  M.  J.  Tuohy  of  Fall  River,  has  been  for  some  time 
placed  on  the  market  through  the  activities  of  Barnett,  Brown 
&amp;  Co.  of  New  York  City.  It  appears  that  the  petitioner  has 
been  engaged  in  the  sale  of  this  infringing  mop,  and  that  this 
fact  may  have  affected  materially  the  success  of  the  Wundermop 
in  New  York  City  and  in  other  territories  assigned  to  Samuel 
Lewis. 

Upon  request  of  petitioner  the  Commission  for  the  Blind  enter- 
tained a  proposal  for  the  purchase  of  Wundermops  from  said 
petitioner,  and  upon  request  received  from  him  an  offer  of  approx- 
imately 5  gross  per  month.  This  oft'er  the  commission  refused  to 
accept  for  the  following  reasons:  first,  because  the  amount  offered 
by  petitioner  was  less  than  that  at  present  taken  by  Samuel 
Lewis,   who   now  purchases   a   quantity   approximating  30  gross 


1915.]  PUBLIC  DOCUMENT  — No.  96.  153 

per  month;  and  second,  because  the  business  status  of  petitioner 
in  New  York  City  was  not  one  which  could  favorably  compare 
with  said  Lewis,  since  the  latter  had,  by  virtue  of  time  and 
acquaintance,  acquired  entree  into  many  of  the  city  and  State 
institutions,  and  for  this  reason  was  able  to  dispose  of  a  contin- 
ually increasing  quantity  of  mops.  It  further  appeared  that 
petitioner  had,  upon  several  occasions,  offered  the  Wundermop 
at  a  so-called  "cut-rate  price,"  and  that  by  his  activities  in  the 
sale  of  the  so-called  Brabro  mop  he  had  affiliated  himself,  to  a 
marked  degree,  with  parties  apparently  infringing  upon  the 
patented  rights  of  the  Wundermop.  It  was  also  stated  by  the 
Commission  for  the  Blind  that  the  element  of  advertising  such 
mops  instituted  by  said  Lewis,  and  made  possible  by  virtue  of 
the  exclusive  agreement  with  Lewis,  established  an  important 
consideration  in  the  present  and  future  sales  of  such  commodity. 
The  Commission  for  the  Blind  stated  that  its  relation  with 
Samuel  Lewis  as  exclusive  selling  agent  of  the  Wundermop  in 
territories  assigned  to  him  was  not  irrevocable,  and  that  upon 
receipt  of  a  better  business  proposition  than  that  now  existing 
between  the  commission  and  said  Lewis,  the  former  would  readily 
enter  into  negotiations  with  any  reliable  party  other  than  its 
present  agent,  Mr.  Lewis. 


The  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  was  established 
by  chapter  385  of  the  Acts  of  1906.  The  general  scope  and  pur- 
pose of  this  State  agency  are  concerned  with  study  of  conditions 
among  the  blind  with  a  view  to  betterment  and  alleviation,  and 
among  other  matters  it  is  specifically  provided,  b^^  section  4  of 
chapter  385  of  the  Acts  of  1906,  that  with  the  approval  of  the 
Governor  and  Council  said  commission  may  "establish,  equip 
and  maintain  one  or  more  schools  for  industrial  training  and 
workshops  for  the  employment  of  the  blind  persons,  may  pay  to 
employees  suitable  wages,  and  may  devise  means  for  the  sale 
and  distribution  of  the  products  of  such  schools  and  workshops." 

By  virtue  of  authority  granted  in  this  section  the  commission 
has  established  several  workshops  throughout  the  Commonwealth, 
and  one  in  particular  in  the  city  of  Cambridge,  where  there  is 
manufactured  at  the  present  time  a  certain  commodity  known  as 
the  Wundermop.  This  mop  is  an  article  of  patented  nature  in- 
vented by  Frederick  W.  Pendergast  of  Cambridge,  a  blind  man, 
and  registered   in  his  name  in   the   United  States  Patent  Office. 


154  ECONOMY  AND   EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 

Under  an  agreement  made  on  the  first  day  of  June,  1910,  between 
said  Pendergast  and  the  Massachusetts  Association  for  Promoting 
the  Interest  of  the  Adult  Blind,  such  patent  rights  as  were 
granted  by  the  United  States  government  to  said  Pendergast 
were,  for  a  consideration,  assigned  to  the  association  herein- 
before mentioned.  In  substance,  this  association  is  a  holding 
company,  and  the  patented  rights  acquired  by  said  Pendergast 
are  now  enjoyed  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind. 
(See  agreement  to  this  effect  on  page  157,  Appendix  I.) 

The  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  is  a  State  insti- 
tution supported  in  substantial  manner  by  appropriations  from 
the  Legislature.  Such  governmental  institution  is,  therefore,  in 
reference  to  the  taxpayers  of  the  Commonwealth,  analogous  to  a 
public  service  corporation,  in  that  it  must  serve  all  the  residents 
of  the  Commonwealth  in  like  manner  and  without  discrimination. 
This  conclusion,  it  would  appear  in  the  premises,  is  obvious. 
Exclusive  arrangements,  therefore,  with  sellmg  agents  within  the 
confines  of  the  Commonwealth  would  appear  to  be  out  of  the 
cjuestion  for  such  State  institution.  Massachusetts  statutes  in 
reference  to  monopoly  (see  R.  L.,  cliap.  5(i,  sect.  1;  chap.  469, 
Acts  of  1907;  chap.  558,  Acts  of  190S;  chap.  503,  Acts  of  1911) 
do  not  appear  to  cover  such  governmental  institutions  as  the 
Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind,  nor  is  such  commis- 
sion by  law  required  to  request  competitive  bids  for  the  purchase 
of  raw  material  or  sale  of  any  products  manufactured  in  its 
workshop.  Beyond  the  confines  of  the  Commonwealth,  however, 
the  statutes  al)ove  quoted  do  not  extend,  and  the  status  of  the 
commission  is,  in  the  large,  analogous  to  that  of  a  private  indi- 
vidual when  dealing  with  residents  of  States  other  than  of 
Massachusetts.  Its  rights,  therefore,  to  make  exclusive  arrange- 
ments with  the  residents  of  other  States  for  the  sale  and  distribu- 
tion of  goods  manufactured  by  the  commission  is  in  no  manner 
controverted  by  law.  When  doing  business,  therefore,  in  a 
foreign  State,  and  when  considered  in  the  large  as  of  the  status 
of  an  individual  concern,  the  commission  could  well  act  within 
its  legal  rights  in  effecting  an  exclusive  agency  with  Samuel  Lewis, 
since  the  contract  was  not  illegal  by  the  Ii'x  loci  contractus. 
Agreements  between  principal  and  agent  or  seller  and  buyer, 
that  an  agent  or  buyer  shall  have  exclusive  territory  within  which 
to  operate  or  resell,  are  not  within  statutes  against  combinations 
when  properly  construed  in  accordance  with  common-law  prin. 


1915.]  PUBLIC   DOCUMENT  — No.  96,  155 

ciples.  (Cf.  27,  Cyc.  900.  See  also  the  case  of  Houck  i'.  Wright, 
77  Miss.,  Reports  476.  The  latter  case  is  to  be  found  on  page 
158,  Appendi.x  II.) 

A  patent  right  and  a  sale  of  goods  thus  protected  constitutes 
by  its  very  nature  a  monopoly,  and  is  attended  with  certain 
legitimate  restrictions  not  otherwise  obtainable  in  the  sale  of 
nonprotected  commodities.  Nowhere  at  common  law  can  there 
be  found  a  prohibition  against  the  creation  of  monopoly  by 
an  individual.  (See  dictum  of  the  court,  Justice  White,  in  the 
case  of  the  Standard  Oil  Company  of  New  York,  rt  al.,  v.  the 
United  States,  31  United  States  Supreme  Court  Reports  502, 
page  621.)  It  would  appear,  therefore,  that  neither  by  statute 
nor  by  common  law  has  the  arrangement  made  by  the  Commis- 
sion for  the  Blind  with  ]Mr.  Lewis  of  New  York  operated  to  an 
illegal  end.  It  is  also  e^•ident  that  the  refusal  of  the  commission 
to  sell  to  the  petitioner  through  the  Tate  Manufacturing  Com- 
pany as  an  agent  was  in  accordance  with  law  and  sound  judg- 
ment, and  could  not  be  held  equivalent  to  a  discrimination  in 
the  matter  of  sales  to  residents  of  the  Commonwealth.  This  is 
so  because  of  the  peculiar  knowledge  which  in  this  instance  the 
Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  had  in  this,  that  the 
Tate  Manufacturing  Company  was  in  substance  an  agent  of  the 
petitioner,  and  that,  therefore,  the  sales  made  to  such  company 
were  in  substance  sales  made  to  petitioner,  and  likewise  a  viola- 
tion of  the  agreement  made  by  the  commission  with  Samuel 
Lewis  of  New  York.  That  the  commission  could  exercise  the 
utmost  prudence  in  the  sale  of  its  patented  commodity  is  clearly 
an  incontrovertible  truism. 

The  commission  is  of  the  opinion,  therefore,  that  no  illegality 
has  attended  any  of  the  transactions  of  the  Commission  for  the 
Blind  in  this  Commonwealth  or  any  other  State  where  such 
commodity  has  been  sold.  The  problem,  therefore,  that  presents 
itself  for  consideration  is  one  which  deals  with  the  wisdom  of 
present  arrangements,  and  is,  therefore,  based  upon  policy  rather 
than  upon  an  infringement  of  the  law.  It  appears  obvious  that 
the  aim  of  the  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  is  to 
procure,  in  so  far  as  possible,  the  largest  possible  amount  of 
work  for  its  unfortunate  employees,  and  this  purpose  it  has  effected 
outside  the  confines  of  the  Commonwealth  by  the  arrangement 
made  with  Mr.  Lewis  already  discussed  in  this  report.  To  dis- 
continue this  arrangement  would  be  to  install  a  general  system 


156  ECONOMY  AND   EFFICIENCY.  [Jan. 

of  distribution  in  foreign  States,  which,  it  might  be  argued, 
would  reduce  the  price  of  the  commodity  and  increase  competi- 
tion. 

That  the  present  arrangement  with  Mr.  Lewis  has  been  pro- 
ductive of  good  can  be  understood  by  tlie  fact  that  in  the  last 
five  years  the  total  sales  of  the  Wundermop  have  approximated 
$146,088,  of  which  amount  Mr.  Lewis  is  accredited  with  sales 
amounting  to  $51,178,  or  approximately  35  per  cent,  of  the  total 
output  of  the  shop.  No  other  arrangement  for  the  sale  and 
distribution  of  the  mop  outside  of  Massachusetts  than  that 
effected  with  Mr.  Lewis  has  ever  been  made.  The  arrangement 
now  in  vogue  has  been  productive  of  good  for  the  blind  em- 
ployees of  the  commission,  and  has  been  continued  as  a  proper 
policy  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  Blind  with  the 
evident  sanction  of  the  Governor  and  Council,  as  provided  by 
section  4  of  chapter  385  of  the  Acts  of  the  year  1906. 

Aside  from  the  merits  of  the  controversy  between  the  Com- 
mission for  the  Blind  and  the  petitioner,  it  might  well  be  ques- 
tioned if  another  and  better  system  of  distribution  could  not  be 
instituted  in  New  York  City  and  other  territories  which  would 
argue  for  a  greater  output  of  the  Wundermop.  Exclusive  rights 
granted  to  agents  in  selected  territories  should  not  be  accom- 
panied by  the  bestowal  of  such  powers  upon  these  agents  as  to 
make  it  possible  for  them  to  refuse  arbitrarily'  the  sale  of  any 
commodity  intrusted  to  their  care.  It  would  seem  that  an 
arrangement  might  be  devised  whereby  said  Lewis  could  well 
retain  the  exclusive  rights  granted  to  him  and  yet  be  directed 
to  sell  to  all,  competitors  or  otherwise,  when  such  parties  were 
in  good  faith.  Violations  of  such  good  faith  by  parties  pur- 
chasing from  Lewis  could  be  effectively  penalized  by  the  refusal 
of  offers  for  continued  supplies  of  the  Wundermop.  It  is,  how- 
ever, in  the  large,  a  cjuestion  of  policy.  It  would  appear  that 
well-established  commercial  usage  has  not  been  considered  the 
best  policy  in  the  contract  existing  between  the  Commission  for 
the  Blind  and  Mr.  Lewis;  yet  it  might  be  well  considered  in 
attempting  an  equitable  solution  of  the  problem.  This  usage, 
it  is  submitted,  might  argue  for  a  check  of  the  arbitrary  powers 
now  enjoyed  by  Samuel  Lewis  in  the  disposition  and  sale  of  the 
Wundermop. 

Respectfully  submitted.

Agreement  between  the  Massachusetts  Association  for  Promot- 
ing THE  Interests  of  the  Adult  Blind  and  Frederick  W. 
Pendergast. 

.Agreement  made  this  first  day  of  June,  1910,  by  and  between  the 
Massachusetts  Association  for  Promoting  the  Interests  of  the  Adult 
Blind,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  association,  party  of  the  first  part, 
and  Frederick  W.  Pendergast  of  Cambridge,  in  tlie  County  of  Middlesex 
and  Commonwealtli  of  Massachusetts,  party  of  the  second  part. 

Witnesselh,  That  whereas  the  said  Pendergast  has  invented  an  improve- 
ment in  mop-heads  and  procured  a  patent  thereon,  being  numbered 
909,449  in  the  Patent  Office  of  the  United  States  of  America;  and 

Whereas,  the  said  Pendergast  has  assigned  to  the  said  association  his 
entire  right,  title  and  interest  in  and  to  the  said  invention  and  Letters 
Patent,  and  any  re-issue,  renewal  or  extension  thereof,  and 

Whereas,  the  said  Pendergast  in  assigning  said  interest,  and  tlie  said 
Association  in  accepting  the  same,  had  in  view  certain  benefits  to  accrue 
to  the  said  Frederick  W.  Pendergast. 

Now,  therefore,  the  said  parties,  the  Association  acting  for  itself,  its 
successors  and  assigns,  the  said  Pendergast  for  himself,  his  executors, 
administrators  and  assigns,  have  agreed  as  follows: 

1.  The  said  Association  sliall  manufacture  and  sell,  and  may  license 
others  to  manufacture  and  sell,  mop-heads,  embodying  said  invention, 
to  the  end  of  the  term  for  which  said  Letters  Patent  were  granted,  and 
shall  use  reasonable  diligence  in  creating  and  supplying  a  demand  for 
said  mop-lieads. 

2.  The  said  Association  agrees  to  pay  the  said  Frederick  W.  Pendergast 
and  his  legal  representatives  a  license  fee  or  royalty  of  ten  (10)  cents  per 
dozen  mop-heads  for  every  dozen  manufactured  and  sold  each  year  by 
the  Association  or  under  licenses  granted  by  it  up  to  and  including  an 
amount  of  fifteen  hundred  (1,500)  dozens;  for  each  five  hundred  (500) 
dozens  of  mop-heads  manufactured  and  sold  each  year  after  said  amount 
of  fifteen  hundred  (1,500)  dozens  the  Association  agrees  to  pay  at  a  smaller 
rate  diminishing  by  one  (1)  cent  per  dozen  for  each  succeeding  five  hun- 
dred (500)  dozens  until  the  rate  shall  become  five  (5)  cents  a  dozen;  so 
that  the  said  Association  agrees  to  pay  for  every  dozen  manufactured  and

Appendix  II. 

HoucK  V.  Wright,  77  Miss.  Reports  476. 
Vose  &amp;  Sons  were  manufacturers  of  pianos  at  Boston,  Massachusetts; 
Houck  &amp;  Co.  were  dealers  in  musical  instruments  at  Memphis,  Tennessee. 
The  manufacturers  agreed  with  the  Memphis  dealers  that  the  latter 
should  have,  to  the  exclusion  of  all  others,  the  right  to  sell  pianos  of  tlie 
former's  manufacture  in  certain  territory  contiguous  to  Mempliis,  in 
Arkansas,  West  Tennessee,  and  North  Mississippi,  including  Lefore 
County  in  this  state.  Houck  &amp;  Co.,  tlirough  a  traveling  salesman,  re-- 
ceived  a  written  contract  or  order  for  a  piano  of  Vose  &amp;  Sons'  manufacture 
from  Wright,  at  Greenwood,  in  said  county,  by  the  terms  of  which  tlie 
same  was  to  be  shipped  to  Greenwood  and  .|100  of  its  price  was  to  be  paid 
upon  delivery.     The  piano  was  so  shipped  and  tendered  to  AVright,  but 


1915.]  PUBLIC  DOCUMENT  — No.  96.  159 

he  refused  to  receive  it.  This  suit  was  begun  by  Houek  &amp;  Co.  to  recover 
under  contract  made  witli  Wright. 

After  hearing  lengthy  arguments  by  opposing  counsel  the  court  (per 
Terral,  J.)  held  as  follows : 

If  the  contract  between  Vose  &amp;  Sons  of  Boston,  and  Houck  &amp;  Co.  of 
Memphis,  were,  for  any  cause,  illegal,  such  illegality  could  not  affect  the 
contract  between  Houck  &amp;  Co.  and  C.  E.  Wright  because  it  is  collateral 
to  it.     2  Beach  Mod.  Law  of  Contracts,  sec.  1589. 

But  the  arrangement  between  Vose  &amp;  Sons  and  Houek  &amp;  Co.  is  en- 
tirely legal.  It  does  not  operate  to  suppress  competition,  nor  to  regulate 
the  production  or  sale  of  any  commodity.  As  said  by  counsel  of  appellant, 
its  purpose  is  to  facilitate  and  advance  the  sale  of  pianos.  It  is  Vose 
&amp;  Sons  regulating  their  own  business,  endeavoring  thereby  to  sell  as 
many  pianos  as  possible,  and  on  the  best  terms  for  themselves  and  their 
customers.  Instead  of  having  an  agency  in  every  county  in  North 
Mississippi,  wliicli  might  be  burdensome,  or  perhaps  ruinous  to  their 
business,  they  have  an  agent  in  a  trade  centre,  Memphis,  where  they  think 
they  can  conduct  their  business  to  advantage;  and  the  Memphis  agent 
Co^nvasses  the  territory  assigned  to  them,  for  the  sale  of  their  pianos, 
and  when  one  is  ordered  they  become  responsible  for  the  price  of  it. 

The  Memphis  house  could  not  afford  to  take  an  agency,  and  send  out 
canvassers  for  the  sale  of  the  pianosi,  if  they  were  to  be  met  everywhere 
by  other  agents  of  Vose  &amp;  Sons  engaged  in  competition  with  them  in  the 
same  business,  and  ao  the  arrangement  they  make  is  mutually  advanta- 
geous to  both  parties,  and  gives  equal  opportunities  for  all  persons  to  pur- 
chase Vose  &amp;  Sons  pianos,  and  upon  the  most  reasonable  terms. 

The  legislature,  by  the  chapter  on  trusts  and  combines,  did  not  intend 
to  debar  a  person  from  conducting  his  own  private  business  according 
to  his  own  judgment.  Indeed  there  is  no  law,  federal  or  state,  that  re- 
quires a  person  to  sell  his  goods,  against  his  will,  to  any  other  person,  or  to 
send  agents  abroad  to  seek  business,  or  even  to  compel  him  to  employ  agents 
inthe  conduct  of  his  business.  These  are  matters  of  private  judgment  and 
discretion,  which  belong  to  every  citizen  by  the  laws  of  nature;  they  are 
rights  inlaerent  in  every  freeman,  which  no  human  law  can  rightly  super- 
sede or  impair. 

Thrj  plaintiff  below  by  his  evidence  before  the  court  entitled  himself 
to  a  judgment,  and  the  contentions  of  the  defendant  are  without  merit.

To  His  Excellency  David  I.  Walsh,  Governor,  State  House,  Boston. 

Dear  Sir:  —  In  compliance  with  your  request  for  an  inves- 
tigation by  this  commission  relative  to  the  number  of  alien 
immigrants  in  the  charitable,  insane  and  penal  institutions  of 
the  State  who  were  less  than  three  years  in  the  country  at  the 
time  of  their  admittance  to  such  institutions,  we  beg  to  submit 
the  following  report:  — 

1.  In  practically  every  institution  inmates  were  found  who 
had  been  in  .the  country  less  than  three  years  at  the  time  of 
their  commitment. 

2.  At  the  institutions  no  definite  information  is  available  as  tn 
tlie  number  of  these  deportable  aliens,  as  no  official  record  is 
kept  of  the  date  of  landing,  name  of  ship,  etc.  The  method 
pursued  at  the  State  Infirmary  at  Tewksbury  for  obtaining 
information  for  this  report  was  as  follows:  the  superintendent  of 
the  infirmary  was  interviewed,  and  from  such  records  as  he  had 
and  by  personal  interviews  with  the  inmates,  114  inmates  were 
found  in  the  institution,  all  of  whom  had  been  in  the  country  less

NOTE. 

This  volume  has  been  designated  the  "  Massachusetts  Volun- 
teer Mihtia  in  the  War  of  1812."  This  was  done  in  error, 
because  by  law  the  active  militia  of  Massachusetts  at  the  pres- 
ent day  is  so  designated.  During  the  War  of  1812-14  the 
mihtia  was  simply  called  "Massachusetts  Militia,"  and  it  should 
have  been  so  termed  in  this  volume.

The  Adjutant  General's  Office,  State  House,  Boston,  April  5,   1913. 

Brig.  Genl.  Gardner  W.  Pearson,  The  Adjutant  General  of  Massachusetts. 

General  :  —  In  accordance  with  the  foregoing  resolve  I  received  instructions 
to  plan  and  compile,  in  proper  form  for  publication,  the  records  of  the  Massa- 
chusetts Volunteer  Militia  who  responded  to  the  call  of  the  Governor  of  Massa- 
chusetts to  suppress  a  threatened  invasion  during  the  War  of  1812-14. 

In  the  early  part  of  May,  1912,  I  submitted  for  your  approval  the  plan  that 
was  to  be  adopted  in  completing  the  work,  and  received  final  instructions  to  com- 
mence. The  work  being  especially  of  a  laborious  kind,  with  your  consent  I  called 
to  my  assistance  Mrs.  Ruth  M.  Bruce,  clerk  for  the  Service  Schools,  M.  V.  M., 
and  Miss  Mabel  L.  Cook,  clerk  in  the  indexing  division  of  the  archives  of  this 
office.  The  work  during  the  whole  year  was  done  entirely  outside  of  office  hours, 
for  the  reason  that  the  numerous  interruptions  that  fall  to  my  lot  in  my  duties 
made  it  absolutely  essential  that  correctness  could  only  be  assured  in  that  way. 
No  attempt  has  been  made  to  make  records  or  correct  them,  such  as  spelling,  etc., 
except  in  cases  where  the  ink  is  fading  and  the  names  are  almost  obliterated ;  then 
efforts  were  made  to  supply  the  missing  letters  in  accordance  with  what  the  names 
might  have  been;  for  example,  the  name  Abbott,  Abott,  Abbot;  the  same  with 
Barrett,  Barret,  Barett;  also  Clap,  Clapp;  Prescott,  Prescot,  etc. 

The  sources  from  which  the  records  were  obtained  are  unknown  to  this  office 
other  than  that  they  were  furnished  during  the  term  of  office  of  Gen.  A.  Hun 
Berry,  Adjutant  General  of  Massachusetts  in  1881,  and  accepted  by  him  as  com- 
ing from  "reliable  sources,"  the  party  furnishing  them  being  Mr.  Z.  K.  Harmon 
of  Portland,  Me. 

Annexed  will  be  found  extracts  pertaining  to  the  actions  of  the  British  along 
the  Massachusetts  coast,  from  B.  J.  Lossing's  "Pictorial  Field  Book  of  the  War 
of  1812,"  pages  888  to  904;  Williamson's  "History  of  Maine;"  Wheeler's  "Cas-

Historical  Narrative. 


"New  England  experienced  ver\-  little  actual  war  within  its  borders,  yet  it  felt  its  pressure 
heavily  in  the  paralysis  of  its  peculiar  industries,  the  continual  drain  upon  its  wealth  of  men 
and  money,  and  the  wasting  excitement  caused  by  constantly  impending  menaces  and  a  sense  of 
insecurity.  From  the  spring  of  1813,  until  the  close  of  the  contest,  British  squadrons  were  hovering 
along  our  coasts,  and  threatening  the  destruction  of  our  maritime  cities  and  villages.  The  year 
1814  was  a  specially  trying  one  for  New  England.  The  British  government  had  determined  and 
prepared  at  the  beginning  of  that  year,  to  make  the  campaign  a  vigorous,  sharp  and  decisive  one 
on  land  and  sea. 

"Early  in  June  the  enemy  commenced  depredations  on  the  coasts  of  Massachusetts.  On 
the  13th  a  detachment  of  two  hundred  men  in  six  barges,  were  sent  from  the  SUPERB  and 
NIMROD,  then  lying  in  Buzzard's  Bay,  to  destroy  the  shipping  at  Wareham.  The  elevated 
rocky  neck  at  the  mouth  of  the  Narrows  concealed  the  approach  of  the  barges,  and  the  inhabitants 
were  taken  by  surprise.  The  enemy  fired  a  ship,  brig,  and  several  smaller  vessels.  The  ship  was 
partially  saved,  and  so  also  was  a  cotton  factory,  which  was  set  on  fire  by  a  congreve  rocket.  The 
estimated  value  of  the  loss  was  $40,000.  Quite  a  number  of  the  leading  inhabitants  were  seized 
and  carried  away  as  hostages,  so  as  to  prevent  the  militia  from  firing  on  the  barges.  These  were 
released  when  the  barges  arrived  at  their  vessels.  Similar  destruction  was  inflicted  at  Scituate, 
and  at  Orleans.  Sometimes  the  militia  would  meet  the  marauders  and  drive  them  away.  At 
Orleans  a  sharp  skirmish  between  the  barges  and  the  militia  took  place,  wherein  the  enemy  lost 
one  killed  and  two  wounded,  besides  nine  taken  prisoners  at  Yarmouth,  where  they  had  drifted 
on  shore  in  a  schooner  laden  with  salt,  which  they  had  captured  at  Orleans. 

"On  the  16th  of  June  the  BULWARK,  74,  Captain  Milne,  carrying  about  ninety  guns, 
anchored  off  the  mouth  of  Saco  River,  in  Maine,  and  her  commander  sent  one  hundred  and  fifty 
armed  men,  in  five  large  boats  to  destroy  property  on  the  Neck  belonging  to  Captain  Thomas 
Cutts.  That  gentleman  met  them  with  a  white  flag,  and  proposed  a  money  commutation.  The 
matter  was  referred  to  Captain  Milne,  who  soon  afterward  came  ashore  in  his  gig.  He  assured 
Cutts  that  he  had  positive  orders  to  destroy,  and  could  not  spare.  The  torch  was  then  applied, 
and  two  vessels  (one  finished,  the  other  on  the  stocks),  valued  at  $15,000,  were  destroyed,  and 
another  one  taken  away,  which  the  owner  afterward  ransomed  for  $6,000.  They  also  plundered 
Mr.  Cutts'  store  of  goods  to  the  amount  of  $2,000. 

"At  about  the  same  time  the  NIMROD  and  LA  HOGUE  were  blockading  New  Bedford 
and  Fair  Haven.     Other  places  were  menaced  and  some  were  attacked. 

"  Early  on  the  morning  of  September  8th,  the  barges  from  the  LEANDER,  Sir  George  Coflier, 
landefl  some  seventy  men  at  Sandy  Baj-  in  Gloucester;   a  dense  fog  favoring  them,  the  sentinel  on 


MASSACHUSETTS    VOLUNTEER   MILITIA    IN    THE    WAR    OF    1812. 


the  small  fort  was  surprised,  before  an  alarm  could  be  given;  they  took  the  officer  and  ten  privates 
of  Capt.  Haskell's  company,  prisoners,  spiked  the  guns,  set  the  guard-house  on  fire,  and  retreated 
to  their  boats.  Meantime  the  alarm  bell  was  rung,  and  the  militia  assembled,  but  not  in  time  or 
sufficient  numbers  to  obstruct  their  retreat.  One  of  the  barges  after  hauling  off,  commenced  a 
fire  on  the  houses,  and  more  particularly  at  the  meeting-house  bell  which  was  ringing,  in  order,  as 
the  officer  said  with  an  oath,  'to  stop  that  church  music';  the  recoil  of  the  gun  caused  the  barge 
to  spring  a  leak,  and  those  who  were  in  her  were  obliged  to  swim  ashore,  and  by  this  means  five 
of  the  privates  who  were  taken  in  the  fort  were  re-captured,  and  thirteen  of  the  enemy  were  taken 
prisoners. 

"As  late  as  December  27th,  1814,  the  British  brig  NIMROD,  Capt. ,  sixteen 

guns,  came  to  anchor  in  Falmouth  harbor,  and  sent  a  boat  on  shore  with  a  flag  of  truce  and  a 
message  to  the  officers  of  the  town,  demanding  the  field-pieces  belonging  to  the  Artillery  Company, 
and,  in  case  of  refusal,  threatening  to  fire  upon  the  town.  This  was  considered  a  mere  ruse,  to 
first  get  possession  of  their  onh'  means  of  defence,  and  then  to  land  and  help  themselves  to  such 
supplies  as  they  might  want,  and  then  plunder  and  destroy  as  they  had  done  at  other  places,  when 
once  in  their  power.  It  is  reported  that  the  town  officers  called  in  Capt.  Weston  Jenkins,  of  the 
Artillery  Company,  and  referred  the  message  from  the  NIMROD  to  him  for  an  answer;  who  at 
once  told  the  messenger  to  inform  his  captain  '  that  if  he  wanted  his  field-pieces,  to  come  and  get 
them '.  This  was  construed  by  the  officers  of  the  NIMROD  as  a  challenge,  who  at  once  sent  word 
that  at  10  A.M.  next  day,  they  should  bombard  the  towia.  Of  course  this  caused  great  consterna- 
tion among  the  inhabitants,  who  at  once  set  about  removing  themselves  and  property  to  a  place 
of  safety.  In  the  meantime  Col.  David  Nye  issued  his  orders  calling  out  the  militia  of  the  town, 
and  also  a  portion  from  Sandwich  and  Barnstable,  who,  during  the  night  and  early  morning 
entrenched  and  posted  themselves  in  such  a  manner  as  to  prevent  the  enemy  from  landing,  if  such 
was  his  purpose.  Promptly  at  the  hour  specified,  the  NIMROD  opened  fire  upon  the  little  town, 
and  blazed  away  for  two  hours,  but  made  no  attempt  to  land;  then  quietly  leaving  the  harbor, 
sailed  for  Halifax,  no  doubt  with  a  parting  blessing  from  the  inhabitants,  uttered  at  least  from  some 
of  them  in  anything  but  a  devotional  spirit. 

"  Many  of  the  dwellings  and  other  buildings  were  badly  riddled,  and  other  property  destroyed, 
which  was  the  extent  of  the  damage. 

"A  more  serious  invasion  of  the  New  England  coast  now  occurred.  Early  in  July,  1814, 
Sir  Thomas  M.  Hardy  sailed  secretly  from  Halifax,  with  a  formidable  force  for  land  and  sea  service. 
His  squadron  consisted  of  the  RAMILLIES,  seventy-four  guns  (his  flagship),  the  sloop  MARTIN, 
brig  BOXER,  the  BREAME,  the  bomb-ship  TERROR,  and  several  transports  with  troops,  under 
Col.  Thomas  Pilkington.  Commodore  Hardy  came  charged  with  a  part  of  the  duty  enjoined  in 
the  terrible  order  of  Admiral  Cochrane,  'TO  DESTROY  THE  COAST  TOWNS  AND  SHIP- 
PING, AND  RAVAGE  THE  COUNTRY.'  This  squadron  entered  Passamaquoddy  Bay  on  the 
nth,  and  anchored  oft'  Fort  Sullivan,  at  Eastport,  which  was  then  in  command  of  Major  Perley 
Putnam,  (of  the  4()th  U.  S.  Infantry)  of  Salem,  with  a  garrison  of  fifty  men  and  six  pieces  of  artil-

five  minutes  for  consideration.  Putnam  promptly  refused  compliance,  but  on  account  of  the 
vehement  importunities  of  the  alarmed  inhabitants  who  were  indisposed  to  resist,  he  yielded  his 
own  judgment  and  ga^e  up  the  post,  on  condition  that  while  the  British  should  take  possession 
of  all  public  property,  private  property  should  be  respected.  WTien  this  agreement  was  signed,  a 
thousand  men  with  women  and  children,  a  battalion  of  artillery,  and  fifty  or  sixty  pieces  of  can- 
non were  landed  on  the  main,  and  formal  possession  was  taken  of  the  fort,  the  town  of  Eastport, 
and  all  the  islands  and  villages  in  and  around  Passamaquoddy  Bay.  Declaration  was  made  that 
these  were  in  permanent  possession  of  the  British,  and  the  inhabitants  were  called  upon  to  take 
an  oath  of  allegiance  to  the  Crown,  or  leave  the  territory.  The  custom  house  was  taken  posses- 
sion of  and  opened  under  British  officials,  who  vainly  endeavored  to  compel  the  collector  to  sign 
unfinished  treasury  notes  to  the  value  of  $9,000.  He  refused,  saying,  'Hanging  would  not  compel 
him'.  Trade  was  resumed,  the  fortifications  around  Eastport  were  completed,  and  sixty  pieces 
of  cannon  were  mounted,  and  an  arsenal  established.  Several  vessels,  and  goods  valued  at  three 
hundred  thousand  dollars,  accumulated  there  to  be  smuggled  into  the  United  States,  were  made 
prizes  of  by  the  British,  who  held  quiet  possession  of  that  region  until  the  close  of  the  war. 

"  Having  established  British  rule  at  Eastport,  and  left  eight  hundred  troops  to  hold  the  con- 
quered region.  Hardy  sailed  westward  with  his  squadron,  spreading  alarm  along  the  coast.  Prep- 
arations for  his  reception  were  made  everywhere,  ^'igilant  eyes  were  watching  and  strong  arms 
waiting  for  the  appearance  of  the  foe.  The  forts  at  Bath,  Portland,  and  Portsmouth  were  manned. 
Little  Fort  Lilly,  at  Gloucester,  was  armed.  Fort  Pickering,  near  Salem,  and  Fort  Sewall  at  Marble- 
head,  were  strengthened  and  garrisoned;  Fort  Warren,  on  Governor's  Island,  and  Fort  Independ- 
ence, in  Boston  harbor,  were  put  in  readiness  for  action,  and  well  garrisoned  by  Massachusetts 
Militia. 

"  An  attack  upon  the  important  City  of  Boston  was  confidently  expected ;  it  was  the  capital 
of  New  England,  and  the  moral  effect  of  its  capture  would  be  great.  It  was  a  place  for  the  con- 
struction of  American  war  vessels,  which  the  enemy  feared  more  than  armies.  On  this  account 
also  its  capture  or  destruction  was  desirable.  It  was  also  a  wealthy  towni,  and  offered  a  rich  har- 
vest for  plunderers.  It  was  well  known  too  that  it  was  almost  defenseless.  Caleb  Strong,  then 
Governor,  was,  it  was  well  known,  intensely  opposed  to  the  war;  and  it  was  not  until  after  all  her 
territory  east  of  the  Penobscot  river  in  the  District  of  Maine,  (then  a  part  of  IMassachusetts,)  was 
in  possession  of  the  enemy,  that  any  energetic  measures  were  taken  for  its  defense.  Then  a  public 
meeting  was  called  to  consider  the  matter,  and  a  committee  consisting  of  Harrison  Gray  Otis,  and 
others,  was  appointed  to  wait  on  the  Governor,  and  present  to  him  an  address  on  the  defenseless 
state  of  the  city.  The  Governor  listened  to  this  appeal,  and  at  once  instituted  measures  for  the 
defense  of  the  whole  line  of  the  coast  of  the  State,  and  of  the  District  of  Maine.  A  heavy  fort  was 
at  once  commenced  on  Noddle's  Island,  (now  East  Boston,)  under  the  supervision  of  Major  Loammi 
Baldwin  as  chief  engineer;  a  call  was  made  for  volunteers  to  work  on  the  fortification,  and  the 
response  was  patriotic;  large  numbers  of  the  citizens  of  all  classes  and  trades  might  be  seen  day 
after  day  toiling  like  common  laborers.

xii  MASSACHUSETTS   VOLUNTEER   MILITIA    IN   THE    WAR   OF    1S12. 

"The  towns  of  Concord  and  Lincoln  sent  in  two  hundred  men  in  one  day,  and  thus  the  work 
went  bravely  on  and  was  completed  and  formally  christened  October  20,  and  named  Fort  Strong, 
in  honor  of  the  Governor.  "Water  batteries  were  erected,  and  also  on  Forts  Warren  and  Inde- 
pendence, and  supplied  with  furnaces  for  heating  shot.  Fortifications  were  also  erected  at  South 
Boston  Point,  and  on  Savin  Hill.  As  a  matter  of  precaution,  to  prevent  the  enemy's  approach  to 
the  city  in  case  he  succeeded  in  passing  the  forts,  vessels  were  purchased  and  made  ready  to  be 
sunk  in  the  channel,  and  providing  all  other  means  failed  to  prevent  his  approach  by  land,  the 
bridges  leading  to  the  towns,  Chelsea,  Charlestowii,  Brighton  and  Cambridge,  were  placed  under 
the  care  of  two  discreet  men,  each  having  fifty  or  sixty  axe-men  under  them,  who  were  as  a  last 
resort  to  destroy  a  portion  of  each  bridge. 

"On  the  6th  of  September,  Governor  Strong  had  issued  his  orders  for  the  whole  of  the  State 
Militia  of  all  arms,  to  be  in  readiness  to  march  to  Boston  at  a  moment's  notice,  and  on  the  same 
day  some  four  thousand  troops  from  the  several  divisions,  consisting  of  Infantry,  Artillery,  and  Rifle- 
men were  ordered  to  march  at  once  for  Boston.  These  troops  began  to  gather  September  8th, 
and  were  properly  officered  and  formed  into  regiments  and  placed  imder  the  supervision  of  Major 
General  Joseph  Whiton.  By  the  middle  of  September  there  were  some  five  thousand  State  troops 
of  all  arms  in  service  at  Boston  and  on  the  forts  and  batteries  in  the  harbor  and  vicinity,  and  all 
were  retained  in  service  until  the  middle  of  November. 

"  Hardy's  easy  conquest  at  Eastport  and  its  vicinity  encouraged  the  British  to  attempt  the 
seizure  of  the  whole  country  lying  between  Passamaquoddy  Bay  and  the  Penobscot  River.  For 
this  purpose  a  British  fleet  consisting  of  the  BULWARK,  DRAGON,  and  SPENCER,  seventy- 
four  guns  each,  the  frigates  BACCHANTE  and  TENEDOS,  sloops-of-war  SYLPH  and  PERU- 
VIAN, and  schooner  PICTOLT,  with  ten  transports  sailed  from  Halifax  on  the  26th  of  August, 
1814.  The  British  troops  consisted  of  the  first  company  of  Royal  Artillery;  two  rifle  companies 
of  the  7th  battalion  of  the  Sixtieth  Regiment;  detachments  from  the  Twenty-ninth,  Sixty-second, 
and  Ninety-eighth  Regiments  —  the  whole  divided  into  two  brigades,  under  command  of  General 
Sir  John  C.  Sherbrooke,  Governor  of  Nova  Scotia,  assisted  by  Major-general  Gerard  Gosselin  and 
Colonel  Douglass.  The  fleet  was  in  command  of  Rear  Admiral  Edward  Griffith.  It  was  the  inten- 
tion of  Sherbrooke  and  Griffith  to  stop  and  take  possession  of  Machias,  but  learning  that  the  Ignited 
States  corvette,  JOHN  ADAMS,  twenty-four  guns,  Capt.  Charles  Morris,  had  gone  up  the  Penob- 
scot, they  hastened  to  the  mouth  of  that  river  to  blockade  her.  Passing  up  the  Green  Island 
channel  they  arrived  in  the  fine  harbor  of  Castine  on  the  morning  of  the  first  of  September.  Lieu- 
tenant Lewis,  of  the  LTnited  States  army,  with  about  forty  men,  was  occupying  a  half-moon  redoubt, 
armed  with  four  twenty-four  pounders  and  two  field-pieces.  Lieutenant  Colonel  Nichols,  of  the 
Royal  Engineers,  sent  a  summons  to  Lewis  at  sunrise  to  surrender.  Lewis  saw  that  resistance 
would  be  vain,  so  he  resolved  to  flee.  He  gave  the  enemy  a  volley  from  his  twenty-four  pounders 
as  a  parting  salute,  then  spiked  them,  blew  up  the  redoubt,  and  with  the  field-pieces  he  and  the 
garrison  fled  over  the  high  peninsula  to  its  neck,  and  escaped  up  the  Penobscot.  Colonel  Douglass 
immediately  landed  from  the  fleet  with  a  detachment  of  Royal  Artillery  and  two  companies  of 


HISTORICAL   NARRATIVE.  XUl 


riflemen  and  took  quiet  possession  of  Castine,  and  with  tliat  the  control  of  Penobscot  Bay.     The 
number  of  troops  landed  was  about  six  hvmdred. 

"As  soon  as  a  landing  had  been  completed,  it  was  made  knowii  to  Sherbrooke  that  the 
ADAMS  had  gone  up  the  river,  and  lie  and  Griffith  immediately  detached  a  land  and  naval  force 
to  seize  and  destroy  that  vessel,  and  treat  the  inhabitants  of  the  towns  on  the  Penobscot  as  cir- 
cumstances might  seem  to  require.  The  expedition  consisted  of  the  SYLPH  and  PERUVIAN, 
a  small  schooner  as  a  tender,  the  transport  brig  HARMONY,  and  nine  launches,  commanded  by 
Capt.  Robert  Barrie,  of  the  Royal  Navy,  who  acted  as  Commodore.  '  In  the  midst  of  the  rapine 
a  committee  Avaited  on  Barrie,  and  told  him  that  the  people  expected  at  his  hands  the  common 
safeguards  of  humanity,  if  nothing  more,  when  the  brutal  officer  replied,  "  I  have  none  for  you. 
INIy  business  is  to  burn,  sink  and  destroy.  Your  town  is  taken  by  storm,  and  by  the  rules  of  war 
we  ought  both  to  lay  your  village  in  ashes  and  put  its  inhabitants  to  the  sword.  But  I  will  spare 
your  lives,  though  I  don't  mean  to  spare  your  houses." '  — WILLIAMSON'S  HISTORY  OF 
MAINE,  ii.,  (i4(j.  The  land  forces,  seven  hundred  strong,  were  under  the  command  of  Lieut. 
Col.  Henry  John,  assisted  by  Major  Riddle.  The  expedition  sailed  in  the  afternoon  of  the  day  of 
the  arri\-al  at  Castine  (Sept.  first),'  and  passing  Bucksport  at  twilight,  anchored  for  the  night. 
There  was  no  disposition  among  the  inhabitants  along  the  Penobscot  to  submit  quietly,  unless 
absolutely  compelled  to.  On  the  day  when  the  expedition  sailed  up  the  river,  information  of  the 
fact  was  conveyed  by  express  to  Capt.  ]\lorris,  of  the  ADAMS,  at  Hampden,  and  he  at  once  sent 
word  to  Brig.  Gen.  John  Blake,  at  his  home  in  Brewer,  asking  him  to  call  out  the  militia.  Blake 
mounted  his  horse,  and  late  in  the  afternoon  was  at  Bangor,  issuing  orders  for  the  assembling  of 
the  Brigade  of  the  Tenth  Massachusetts  division,  of  which  he  was  commander,  and  the  same  even- 
ing rode  down  to  Hampden.  There  he  found  Capt.  INIorris  engaged  in  preparations  for  defense. 
He  had  dismantled  the  JOHN  ADAMS,  dragged  her  heavy  guns  to  the  summit  of  the  high  right 
bank  of  the  Soadabscook,  fifty  rods  from  the  wharf,  and  placed  them  in  battery  there,  so  as  to 
command  the  river  approaches  from  below.     On  the  following  morning  Blake  held  a  consultation 

'  "Immediately  after  the  capture  of  Castine,  the  British  government  there  established  a  Custom-house,  or 
excise  house,  and  appointed  a  Collector  of  Customs,  who  from  that  time  until  the  twenty-fourth  of  April  1815,  con- 
tinued to  receive  entries  of  vessels  and  merchandise,  conformably  to  the  laws  and  regulations  in  the  province  of 
Nova  Scotia.  During  this  period  many  merchants  residing  at  Castine  imported  goods  and  entered  them  with  the 
said  British  Collector  paying  duties  thereon  to  the  British  government." — From  Wheeler's  "Castine,"  p.  175.

Dalhousie  College,  Halifax,  N.  S." — From  "Castine;   Past  and  Present,"  by  George  A.  Wheeler,  A.M.,  M.D.,  p.  53. 

"The  British  authorities  collected  the  Revenue  of  Maine  while  in  occupation  which  amounted  to  a  consider- 
able sum  of  money.  This  fund  was  placed  by  the  colonial  minister  in  the  hands  of  the  Lieutenant-Governor  of 
Nova  Scotia  who  appropriated  it  in  various  ways  as  he  thought  most  for  the  benefit  of  the  country.  It  was  from 
this  fund  that  Dalhousie  College  was  afterwards  built." —  From  "H'story  of  Halifax  City,"  by  T.  B.  ,\kins,  Vol.  8,

xiv  MASSACHUSETTS    VOLUNTEER   MILITIA    AND    THE    WAR    OF    1812. 


with  Morris,  and  citizens  of  Bangor  and  Hampden,  on  the  best  methods  of  defense,  but  opinions 
were  so  various  that  no  specific  determination  was  arrived  at.  Morris  had  not  much  confidence 
in  the  miHtia,  and  declined  any  immediate  co-operation  with  them.  He  approved  of  a  proposition 
to  meet  the  foe  at  his  landing-place,  wherever  that  might  be,  and  expressed  his  determination  to 
destroy  the  ADAMS,  should  the  militia  retreat. 

"On  the  morning  of  the  2d,  Belfast  on  the  western  side  of  Penobscot  Bay,  was  taken  pos- 
session of  by  Gen.  Gosselin,  at  the  head  of  six  hundred  troops,  without  resistance,  and,  at  the  same 
time,  the  expedition  under  Barrie  and  John,  after  landing  a  detachment  from  the  Sixtieth  and 
Ninety-eighth  Regiments  at  Frankfort,  proceeded  up  the  river.  The  detachment  marched  up  the 
western  side  of  the  Penobscot  unmolested,  and  the  little  squadron  arrived  at  Bald  Hill  cove,  near 
Hampden,  at  5  o'clock  in  the  evening.  The  troops  and  about  eighty  marines  were  landed,  and 
bivouacked  there  during  the  night,  in  the  midst  of  a  drenching  rain-storm. 

"During  the  2d,  about  six  hundred  raw  militia,  who  had  never  seen  anything  more  like  war 
than  their  own  annual  parade,  assembled  at  Hampden,  and  Gen.  Blake  posted  them  in  an  admir- 
able position  on  the  brow  of  the  hill.  He  had  been  joined  by  Lieutenant  Lewis  and  forty  regulars 
who  fled  from  Castine.  The  artillery  company  of  Blake's  brigade,  commanded  by  Capt.  Ham- 
mond was  there  with  two  brass  three-pounders,  and  an  eighteen  pound  cannonade  from  Morris' 
vessel  was  placed  in  battery  in  charge  of  Mr.  Bent,  of  the  artillery.  Many  of  the  militia  were 
without  weapons  or  ammunition,  and  these  were  supplied  as  far  as  possible  by  Capt.  Morris.  Such 
was  Blake's  position  on  the  dark  and  gloomy  morning  of  the  3d. 

"Morris,  in  the  meantime  had  mounted  nine  short  eighteen-pounders  from  the  ADAMS 
upon  his  redoubt  on  the  high  bank  over  Crosby's  wharf,  and  placed  the  battery  in  charge  of  Lieu- 
tenant Wadsworth,  first  officer  of  the  ADAMS,  assisted  by  Lieutenants  Madison  and  Purser. 
With  the  remainder  of  his  guns  he  took  position  in  person  on  the  wharf  with  about  two  hundred 
seamen  and  marines,  prepared  to  defend  his  ship  to  the  last  extremity. 

"The  whole  region  of  the  Penobscot  was  enveloped  in  a  dense  fog  on  the  morning  of  the  3d. 
The  British  at  Bald  Hill  Cove  had  been  joined  by  the  detachment  which  landed  at  Frankfort,  and 
at  five  o'clock  all  were  in  motion  toward  Hampden.  They  moved  cautiously  in  the  mist,  with  a 
vanguard  of  riflemen.  On  the  flanks  were  detachments  of  marines  and  sailors,  with  a  six-pound 
cannon,  and  a  six  and  one-half  inch  howitzer,  and  a  rocket  apparatus.  The  British  vessels  moved 
slowly  up  the  river  at  the  same  time  within  supporting  distance. 

"Blake  had  dispatched  two  flank  companies  to  watch  and  annoy  the  approaching  enemy. 
Between  seven  and  eight  o'clock  they  reported  them  crossing  the  little  stream  below  Hampden 
and  ascending  the  hill  to  attack  the  Americans.  The  fog  was  so  thick  that  no  enemy  could  be  seen; 
but  Blake  pointed  his  eighteen-pounder  in  the  direction  of  the  foe,  and  with  his  field-pieces  blazed 
away  with  considerable  effect,  as  was  afterward  ascertained.  He  had  resolved  to  reserve  his  mus- 
ket firing  until  the  enemy  should  be  near  enough  to  be  seriously  hurt;  but  the  ordeal  of  waiting 
without  breastworks  in  front  was  too  severe  for  the  untried  militia.  The  enemy  suddenly  advanced 
at  a  'double-quick',  firing  volleys  in  rapid  succession.  The  militia,  panic  stricken,  broke  and  fled 
in  every  direction,  leaving  Blake  and  his  officers  alone.     Lieut.  \Yadsworth,  at  Morris'  upper  bat- 


HISTORICAL    NARRATIVE.  XV 


tery,  perceived  the  disaster  in  its  full  extent,  and  communicated  the  fact  to  his  chief  on  the  wharf. 
Morris  knew  the  impending  danger;  his  rear  and  flank  were  exposed,  and  he  saw  no  other  way  for 
salvation  than  flight.  He  ordered  Wadsworth  to  spike  his  guns,  and  with  his  men  retreat  across 
the  bridge.  Wadsworth  did  so,  his  rear  gallantly  covered  by  Lieut.  Watson  with  some  marines. 
The  JOHN  ADAMS  was  fired  upon  and  blown  up  at  the  same  time,  the  guns  on  the  wharf  were 
spiked,  and  the  men  under  the  immediate  command  of  IMorris  retreated  across  the  bridge.  Their 
commander  was  the  last  to  leave  the  wharf,  and  before  he  could  reach  the  bridge  the  enemy  were 
on  the  bank  abo\e  him;  he  dashed  across  the  stream  arm-pit  deep  under  a  galling  musket  fire 
from  the  British,  imliurt,  and  joining  his  friends  on  the  other  side,  retreated  with  Blake,  his  offi- 
cers, and  a  bare  remnant  of  his  command,  to  Bangor. 

"The  British  took  possession  of  Hampden  without  further  resistance,  and  pushing  on  to 
Bangor  entered  that  village  and  cjuartered  on  the  inhabitants,  where  for  thirty  hours  the  soldiers 
and  sailors  were  given  tacit  license  by  Barrie  to  plunder  as  much  as  they  pleased.  The  inhabitants 
were  compelled  not  only  to  bring  in  and  surrender  their  arms  and  military  stores,  but  to  report 
themselves  prisoners  of  war  for  parole.  General  Blake  was  compelled  to  come  to  Bangor,  sur- 
render himself  as  a  prisoner,  and  sign  the  same  parole. 

"Having  despoiled  the  inhabitants  of  property  valued  at  $23,000,  and  destroyed  several 
vessels,  the  marauders  left  Bangor,  and  spent  the  5th  in  similar  employment  at  Hampden.  There 
the  soldiers  and  sailors,  unrebuked  by  Barrie,  committed  the  most  wanton  acts  of  destruction. 
The  total  loss  of  property  at  Hampden,  exclusive  of  a  \aluable  cargo  of  brandy,  wine,  oil,  and  silk 
w^hich  they  found  on  board  the  schooner  CO:\IMODORE   DECATUR,  was  estimated  at  $44,000. 

"  The  indignant  sufferers  charged  a  great  portion  of  their  misfortunes  to  the  feeble  resistance 
made  by  Gen.  Blake  at  Hampden.  His  tardiness,  his  non-compliance  with  the  wishes  of  Morris, 
and  others  to  attack  the  enemy  at  their  landing-place;  his  neglect  to  throw  up  breast-works  on 
the  ridge  at  Hampden,  and  other  evidence  of  inefficiency,  were  regarded  as  crimes,  and  he  was 
charged  with  cowardice  and  even  treason.  The  clamor  against  him  was  vehement  for  some  time, 
but  the  public  indignation  finally  cooled,  and  sober  judgment,  on  considering  the  crude  materials 
of  his  little  force,  acquitted  him  of  every  other  fault  but  a  lack  of  competent  military  ability  and 
experience  for  the  extraordinary  occasion.  A  court  of  inquiry  investigated  his  conduct  and 
acquitted  him.  On  the  12th  of  September,  Sherbrooke  and  Griffith,  with  most  of  the  troops  and 
a  greater  part  of  the  fleet,  left  Penobscot  Bay,  and,  after  capturing  Machias,  returned  to  Halifax. 
The  proclamation  by  the  President,  James  Madison,  of  the  Treaty  of  Peace,  which  was  concluded 
on  December  24,  1814,  was  made  on  the  ISth  of  February  1815,  and  on  the  25th  of  April  the  Brit- 
ish sailed  out  of  Penobscot  Bay. 

"Peace,  joy,  tranquillity,  and  prosperity  came  with  the  birds  and  blossoms  in  the  spring 
of  1815,  and  from  that  day  until  now  no  foreign  enemy  has  ever  appeared  on  our  coast."
