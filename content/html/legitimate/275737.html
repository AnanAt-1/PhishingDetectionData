<H1>Spam?</H1>
<UL>
  <LI>Originally, SPAM is <I>spicy ham packaged in a handy dandy 12-ounce can</I> from <A HREF="http://www.hormel.com/">Hormel Foods</A> that can be found in almost every food market in the United States.</LI>
  <LI>Technically speaking, <EM>spam</EM> describes a particular kind of Usenet posting. Unfortunately this is not what <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> is designed for...</LI>
  <LI>If somebody is not speaking about neither of the above one, I'd bet my bottom dollar for the fact that he/she is referring to <EM>UBE</EM> (Unsolicited Bulk Email), <EM>UCE</EM> (Unsolicited Commercial Email), <EM>MMF</EM> (Make Money Fast), or <EM>MLM</EM> (Multi Level Marketting) types of eMail postings... Just the ones that drive every eMail user insane every now and then.</LI>
</UL>
<H1>POP3?</H1>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>POP3</EM> describes the <EM>PostOffice Protocol</EM> and is defined in <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1939.html">RFC-1939</A>. Almost every mail client today supports <EM>POP3-protocol</EM>.</LI>
  <LI>There is also another type of mail delivery protocol, <EM>IMAP</EM>, which actually is a far superior protocol. Unfortunately <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> doesn't offer support for that yet, because of the facts that
  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>IMAP is a much harder protocol to implement and</LI>
    <LI>I personally don't have any possibilities to test it myself because I don't have a single IMAP-account.</LI>
  </OL>

<H1>PSFPOP3?</H1>
<IMG SRC="psfpop3.gif" WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="338" ALT="[Screenshot of PSFPOP3]" ALIGN="RIGHT">
<UL>
  <LI><EM>PSFPOP3</EM> is a one man effort to the ongoing fight against <EM>spam</EM>. <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> is a simple application for the Win32-platform that
  <UL>
    <LI>fetches mail from users' POP3-accounts</LI>
    <LI>filters them for <EM>spam</EM></LI>
    <LI>stores mail to wait for delivery</LI>
    <LI>and finally delivers the mail to the users' mailbox</LI>
  </UL>
  <LI>This means that <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> acts as both client and server, which allows it to be independent of any specific mail clients. You can use <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> <U>with any mail client available</U>.</LI>
  <LI>You can download <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> at <A HREF="/utu/psfpop3/psfpop3.zip">psfpop3.zip</A> (<A HREF="/utu/">author's homepage</A> - go and check out the nutcracker that created this one).</LI>
  <LI>Multi-language userinterface will be implemented soon. Currently the application is available is english only.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Setting it up</H2>
<P>Since the process of setting up the application is not as straightforward as some people would hope, <A HREF="setup.html">the setup instructions are available on another page</A> or as <A HREF="psfpop3.pdf">a downloadable PDF-document</A>. To view the PDF-file, you need an application like <A HREF="http://www.adobe.fi/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat Reader</A>.</P>
<P>If you're having trouble with the application, this is a good place to start. Most of the problems are caused by incorrect setup.</P>
<H2>Recent changes</H2>
<H3>30.09.2003</H3>
<P>Due to the increased problems with floodmailing worms (<A HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/swen.shtml">Swen</A>, <A HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/bugbear_b.shtml">Bugbear</A>, <A HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/fizzer.shtml">Fizzer</A> and others that have similar spreading tactics), I implemented a new handler for such messages (well, on my opinion they are nothing but irritating mail, and because <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> can do something about them, why shouldn't it). The message is intercepted and the original message included as an attachement with some guidelines for how to act with messages containing suspicious attachements. Also the subject of the message is altered so that users can make rules on their mail clients not to download such messages from <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> and thus saving precious bandwidth (this has no use for people running <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> on the same machine they use to read their mail, but for me who runs around with a laptop and sometimes is forced to using slow dialup connections this is a blessing).</P>
<P>It should be noted that <STRONG>even with this new functionality, people should still use up-to-date anti-virus software for protection</STRONG> - <EM>PSFPOP3</EM> is not intended as one; it doesn't do any further virus scanning on the file, it just supposes unpacked executable files sent as attachements to be something worth stopping (on the other hand, who would send an unpacked executable through eMail? I can't figure why someone would do such a thing).</P>
<H2>Known bugs</H2>
<P>There are currently no actual bugs that are known. Some things in the layout appear not entirely the way they're intended on platforms using "Large Fonts", but this is more of a feature than a bug - I will fix it eventually but right now correcting the differences in appearance are not very high on the to-do-list. <TT>:-p</TT></P>
<H2>Unknown bugs</H2>
<P>If you encounter a bug using this application, please report it to me at <A HREF="mailto:spamfilter@disconova.com">spamfilter@disconova.com</A></P>
