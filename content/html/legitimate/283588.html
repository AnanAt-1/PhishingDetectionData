<b>Q:</b> 
Suppose it is a 4-player partnership game.
One team has a one-car train on the board.
An unanswered Broken Car disaster is played
on this train so that the car is sent to the disaster
pile.  The question is, what happens to the locomotive
card that was on this train?
<p>
In a non-partnership game, it would be picked up by
the owning player, but now that the trains have 2 owners,
the rules do not seem to make clear who would pick it up.

Hello!<br>
Thank-you for your interest in Express.<br>
Since both players have equal access to the locomotive cards for the 
partnership, you can assume that whichever partner's turn is next is actually 
the controller of the unattached locomotive. Which partner is next depends, 
of course, on which direction play is going (due to the results of turntable 
cards).

<b>Q:</b> 
What happens if during the initial deal a player receives so
many disasters that he is unable to get down to the required 5
cards?

In the highly unlikely event that a single player should be dealt all eight 
disaster cards, and is unable to play even after he draws his two cards from 
the draw pile (because he drew a Way card for example) then the hand should 
be declared a mis-deal and all the cards should be shuffled back together and 
the hand begun anew.

<b>Q:</b> 
The 15th page of the rules says "With 2 or 3 players, use only
2 turntable cards", but the 4th page of the rules says "use only 2
with 3 or 4 players".  Which one is correct?

As for your second question, the rules on page 15 are the correct rules. You 
should only use 2 turntable cards when you are playing with two or three 
players (to prevent abuse of the turntables). Otherwise you should use all of 
the turntable cards. Sorry for the confusion on that one!
