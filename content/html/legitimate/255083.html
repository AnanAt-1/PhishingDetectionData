<blockquote>
These two demos show how we're making active autostereo displays.
In order to show somebody a three dimensional
scene, without requiring them to wear stupid 3D glasses,
you need to get a different image
viewer's left and right eyes.
<p>
<b>
The naive way:
</b>
One way to do this
is to build a robot that moves around behind
a giant focusing screen, as shown below in the
first applet.  The robot places a
light source at the focused image of the viewer's left
eye (shown in red), and another light source at the focused
image of the viewer's right eye (shown in green).
As the viewer's moves, the robot tracks his position,
always placing these two light sources at the right spot.
Meanwhile, a computed image (seen in the black circle)
figures out what the 3D object would look like
as seen from each of the viewer's two eyes.
<p>
To shutter between the two images,
an autostereo display
would use either polarized light
sources and a variably polarized screen,
or else rapidly alternating light sources and a
screen showing rapidly alternating images.
Ideally, each of the viewer's eyes sees only one
of the images.
In the first demo below, the mechanical
contraption does inverse kinematics to
drive two rotational motors, to both rotate
the arm and to contract/extend it.
<p>
<b>
A better way:
</b>
In practice,
you wouldn't want to use a mechanical device for moving
the lights around,
because it would be way too slow
to keep up seamlessly with head movement.
That's why we're working on
the approach demonstrated in the second applet below,
an <a href=#autoshutter>
all-electronic light shutter
</a>.

<h1>2) All-electronic autostereoscopic display:</h1>

We would like an autostereoscopic display to
present a different image to the user's left and right eyes.
In practice,
you do not want to use a mechanical device for moving
the lights around,
because it would be way too slow
to keep up seamlessly with head movement.
For this reason,
we plan to develop
the approach demonstrated in the second applet below,
an
all-electronic light shutter for autostereoscopic display.

<p>
Notice how the shutter lines get thinner as
the user's head moves further away from the screen.
Also notice how the shutter line spacing
varies as the user turns his head to the side.
