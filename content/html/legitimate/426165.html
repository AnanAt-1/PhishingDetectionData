                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">His death was announced by his son, Bill, and confirmed by John Halligan, a family friend and hockey historian. Chadwick had been in declining health for a number of years and died while in hospice care. </p>

He invented and perfected the system of hand signals to signify penalties,
                                            and the system is now used by hockey officials throughout the world.</p>

                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Bill Chadwick had the confidence and the creativity to introduce hand signals to officiating,&#x201D; said N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman. &#x201C;He had the courage to make the tough calls. His honesty
                                            and integrity brought him to the very top of his profession.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">William Leroy Chadwick was born in Manhattan on Oct. 10, 1915. He became an amateur hockey player of some note while attending Jamaica High School, where one of his teammates was John Mitchell, the future United
                                            States Attorney General under Richard Nixon. He also excelled at baseball, winning the city championship with Jamaica in 1933 and playing at various times against future Major Leaguers Phil Rizzuto and Sid Gordon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But hockey was Chawick&#x2019;s sport of choice, and he honed his skills on racing skates at Baisley Park and Goose Pond in Queens and at the Brooklyn Ice Palace. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Following high school, Chadwick played under an assumed name at Fordham University. A center, he also starred with the Jamaica Hawks and the New York Stock Exchange Brokers in the Metropolitan Amateur Hockey League.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1935, playing for a Met League All-Star Team at Madison Square Garden, Chadwick was struck in the right eye by an errant puck as he stepped onto the ice to face a team from Boston. He spent a week at Manhattan
                                            Eye and Ear Hospital, but doctors were unable to restore the vision in the eye. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite the injury, and over the fierce objections of his parents, Chadwick continued to play hockey with the New York Rovers of the Eastern Hockey League. Then, early in the 1936-37 season, he was hit in his left
                                            eye by an opposing player&#x2019;s stick. The injury wasn&#x2019;t nearly as serious as the earlier one, but Chadwick knew his hockey-playing days were finished. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Nobody loved the game more than I did, but I couldn&#x2019;t take the chance of losing the other eye as well,&#x201D; Chadwick recalled in his 1974 autobiography, &#x201C;The Big Whistle,&#x201D; written
                                            with Hal Bock. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In March 1937, Chadwick was a spectator at the Garden, watching the Rovers in pregame warm-ups. He was paged over the public address system and asked to report to the penalty timekeeper&#x2019;s bench. The scheduled
                                            referee that afternoon, Ray Levia, was stuck in a snowstorm, and Tommy Lockhart, the Garden&#x2019;s amateur hockey boss, asked Bill to referee the game. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the whistle?&#x201D; Chadwick
                                            said. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Lockhart was impressed with Chadwick&#x2019;s work and soon offered him a full-time officiating position. &#x201C;My salary was $55 a week,&#x201D; Chadwick recalled, &#x201C;which wasn&#x2019;t bad, but you had
                                            to cover all of your own expenses. I worked the northern circuit of the league, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlantic City and River Vale, N.J.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chadwick soon caught the attention of Frank Calder, the president of the National Hockey League, and late in 1939, Calder asked Chadwick to join the N.H.L. as a linesman. He accepted and became the league&#x2019;s
                                            first United States-born official, working his first game at the Garden, the Montreal Canadiens vs. the New York Americans. A year later, he was promoted to referee. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;There were some prejudices against me being an American and all,&#x201D; Chadwick remembered, &#x201C;but I had the full support of Calder and his successor, Clarence Campbell. Lester Patrick, the Rangers&#x2019;
                                            general manager, was also a great booster of mine.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As for his vision handicap, Chadwick often said: &#x201C;Psychologically, I think it even made me a better official because it was always on my mind, so I tried even harder not to make a mistake. I skated harder
                                            than the other guys.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As for the hand signals, Chadwick doesn&#x2019;t recall exactly when he started using them. &#x201C;Somewhere around 1943 or 1944 would be fairly accurate,&#x201D; he told Halligan in a 2004 interview. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;I know it was during the Stanley Cup final. There was so much noise that I had difficulty communicating with the penalty timekeeper. So I began using a kind of sign language, touching my leg for tripping,
                                            my elbow for elbowing, and so on. That&#x2019;s how it started.&#x201D; Chadwick&#x2019;s signals were not made official by the league until 1956, the year after he retired. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Following his hockey career, Chadwick was general manager of a moving company in Brooklyn, and manager of the Pine Hollow Country Club in East Norwich, Conn. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1965, at the urging of Emile Francis, the Rangers&#x2019; longtime general manager and coach, Chadwick embarked on a remarkable, 14-year broadcasting career, working first on radio with play-by-play man Marv
                                            Albert, and most notably, on television with Jim Gordon for nine seasons </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He called Ranger games with great flourish and more than a few trademark phrases until 1981. &#x201C;Shoot the puck, Barry, shoot the puck!&#x201D; he often exhorted defenseman Barry Beck. Others included: &#x201C;That
                                            guy handles the puck like a cow handles a gun&#x201D; and &#x201C;He couldn&#x2019;t put the puck in the ocean if he was standing on the end of the dock.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Bill was a natural for broadcasting even though he wasn&#x2019;t formally trained in it,&#x201D; Francis said. &#x201C;He and Jim Gordon got more mail than some of our players. For a native New Yorker to
                                            do what he did in hockey at that time was really unbelievable.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Arthur Friedman, the Rangers&#x2019; longtime statistician, dubbed Chadwick &#x201C;The Big Whistle&#x201D; in 1969, and the nickname stuck, thanks to considerable usage by Gordon, Albert and Sal Messina. &#x201C;That
                                            nickname made me a celebrity,&#x201D; Chadwick recalled. &#x201C;If it weren&#x2019;t for Artie Friedman, my book wouldn&#x2019;t have had a title.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chadwick would regale fans &#x2014; and Gordon &#x2014; with tales of the N.H.L. through the 1940s and 1950s, may of which centered around the stars of that era, Gordie Howe, Terry Sawchuk, Maurice (The Rocket)
                                            Richard and, especially, his perennial officiating partner Frank (King) Clancy. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;My clearest memories are of the playoffs,&#x201D; Chadwick said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the whistles that you blow, and the whistles that you don&#x2019;t, that ultimately decides the winner of the most famous
                                            trophy in sports. That&#x2019;s an enormous responsibility. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Knowing the rules and applying them fairly are two different things,&#x201D; Chadwick said. &#x201C;This was especially true in the playoffs, when everything was on the line. Believe me, playoff games are
                                            officiated differently than regular-season games. Referees try to have the players themselves decide the outcome in the playoffs. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The wisdom of my time was that the best referee was the one who was hardly ever noticed. It didn&#x2019;t work that way with me. I was part of the game. The hand signals had a lot to do with that, sure,
                                            but officials have personalities too.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Nowadays, the Stanley Cup travels with elaborate security and a personal caretaker who is with the trophy around the clock. &#x201C;In my day,&#x201D; Chadwick recalled, &#x201C;my usual partner was Clancy. We were
                                            the caretakers. The travel was by train, and the Cup usually stayed in my berth because King had seniority. By day, it stayed in our hotel room. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;During some of the longer series, particularly the one between Toronto and Detroit in 1942, we felt like we owned the Stanley Cup. We took it everywhere. Clancy and I played a lot of cards, and I remember
                                            tossing money or chips sometimes into the Cup&#x2019;s bowl.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is one particular game that Chadwick remembered with a chuckle. It was also between the Red Wings and Maple Leafs. &#x201C;Halfway through the second period, someone threw a shoebox on the ice, and out scampered
                                            a rabbit. My linesman, Sammy Babcock, and I had the damndest time trying to corner the thing. We couldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Eventually, the rabbit found a home in the Toronto goal net, behind Turk Broda. &#x201C;The rabbit was the only thing Broda didn&#x2019;t stop that night,&#x201D; Chadwick said, &#x201C;because I remember the Leafs
                                            waxed the Red Wings pretty good that game.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chadwick also recalled fans throwing coins on the ice, not in Montreal or Toronto, but in New York, Boston, Chicago and Detroit. &#x201C;There were never any quarters, of course, or even dimes for that matter,&#x201D;
                                            he said. &#x201C;But there were plenty of pennies and nickels. Let&#x2019;s put it this way: my kids had two of the fattest piggybanks on Long Island.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a referee, Chadwick worked more than 900 regular-season games, plus a record 42 Stanley Cup finals games, including 13 games in which the Cup was decided. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 1964, Chadwick was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, only the fifth official, and the first American-born official, to be so honored. In 1974, he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame,
                                            and in 1975 he won the Lester Patrick Award for outstanding service to hockey in the United States. </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chadwick retired in 1988 to Cutchogue, N.Y., on Long Island&#x2019;s north shore, about 100 miles east of New York City. &#x201C;You know how far out on Long Island, I am?&#x201D; he joked. &#x201C;When I turn to
                                            my left, I see Portugal.&#x201D; </p>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Chadwick was pre-deceased by his wife Millie. In addition to his son Bill of Malibu, Calif., Chadwick is survived by five grandchildren, Arielle, Chelsea and Kylie Chadwick, all of Malibu, Jessica Andrews of Highlands
                                            Ranch, Colo., and Matthew Kolon of Bejing; four great grandchildren; and his longtime companion Joan Langemyr of Cutchogue. </p>

                                        <p>A sad note. I remember listening to Bill do color as Jim Gordon did the play by play on WOR-TV. This was back when I was first becoming a hockey fan. I always liked Chadwick; he seemed like a &#x201C;what you hear
                                            is what you get&#x201D; kind of straight-up guy. Thank you for giving his passing the notice he deserved.</p>

                                        <p>my family, my mom, my brother and i all worked for Mr. Chadwick at Skateland on Long island. He was a Class Act, on the ice , off the ice on and off the air. He let my kid sister, a competitve skater, skate for
                                            free, those hours meant so much to us. He was so proud of his family.</p>

                                        <p>I share with felixwas the same fond memories of listening to &#x201C;Whistle&#x201D; and Jim Gordon as they broadcast the Ranger road games on WOR &#x2013; &#x2013; way back in the early/mid &#x2019;70s. Coincidentally,
                                            I had just Googled the two on Friday evening, so it came as a shock to first learn that Jim had passed several years ago, and then last night to see the sad news about Mr. Chadwick. I will never forget those
                                            Saturday evening games in Toronto, when during intermission, Bill would hook up with King Clancy, and the two old battle-axes would trade war stories and talk smack as only a couple of grizzled old-timers could!
                                            What fun! I do miss Jim Gordon, and I will always miss Bill Chadwick&#x2026;my best wishes go out to their families.</p>

                                        <p>Jim Gordon and Bill Chadwick were perfect together for me as a kid watching Rangers games in the late 60s/early 70s. It is only now that when you think about how over-produced a sporting telecast has become that
                                            I can truly appreciate the work they did and how they did it even more. They broadcast the games as if they were sitting next to you. Now I know why I loved those Cat Francis teams so much. It was the work of
                                            Jim Gordon and Bill Chadwick. We were so lucky to have them for our Rangers.</p>

                                        <p>I was saddened to hear Saturday night during the Rangers/Canadiens game that Bill Chadwick passed away. Thanks for posting the obituary. I remember listening to Marv and Bill on the radio, as most games in the 60&#x2019;s
                                            weren&#x2019;t on TV. Then, of course, it was Jim Gordon with Bil on TV. </p>
                                        <p>I&#x2019;m glad for one thing this obituary set straight. I always thought it was Marv Albert who gave The Big Whistle his nickname. Was it Marv who gave Art Friedman the nickname Art the Dart?</p>

                                        <p>What a wonderful tribute and story &#x2014; I&#x2019;m glad that others had the identical recollections on just how good Bill was as an announcer/analyst &#x2014; IMO, the BEST I&#x2019;ve ever heard in ANY sport,
                                            because of his ability to teach his listeners on both the fundamentals and nuances of the game at the same time all the while being honest and VERY entertaining.</p>
                                        <p> For a kid whose hockey education had come from playing some street hockey with the occasional pick-up ice game when the drainage sump froze over, this was more than I could ever have hoped for.</p>
                                        <p>BTW, I live in LA and learned of Bill&#x2019;s passing on Sunday from a three-line mention in the LA Times, so I especially appreciated John Halligan&#x2019;s obituary giving Bill his just due, and I think that
                                            Isiah Freshwater #7&#x2019;s comment on Bill also deserving to be in the HOF for his announcing skills is a great suggestion.</p>

                                        <p>all hits to the head should be punished with suspensions. its laughable that it would have been a &#x201C;bad&#x201D; hit if it was with the elbow or if he left his feet or if it was a stick. somehow a shoulder
                                            with the full force of a players body and weight behind it is somehow less damaging. the fact that booth got knocked out cold and taken off the ice on a stretcher and spent the night in the hospital and will
                                            miss 3 games shows how stupid and illogical that position is. i also wonder if this hit was to sidney crosby how different their ruling would have been.</p>
                                        <p>also ridiculous is the idea that head hunting is somehow a clean play or its &#x201C;manly&#x201D; to hit a guy when he isnt looking.</p>
                                        <p>the nhl needs to read the steady stream of reports coming out (and reported on in the nytimes) concerning head injuries in sports and the long term damage that results.</p>

                                            my homework until the game was over. What a great man, and the woman who wrote about him owning the ice arena made me want to cry!</p>

                                        <p>Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, would be the most succinct response to your post. </p>
                                        <p>But, for good measure, here are some facts: Eric Lindros was *playing the puck* when Stevens hit him. It was right between his feet and he was looking down to find it when Stevens arrived. </p>
                                        <p>In this case, Booth had already passed the puck and another Panther was shooting it when the hit took place. </p>
                                        <p>The *only* similarity is that a player was knocked unconcious. </p>
                                        <p>If you wanted to make a more appropriate analogy involving Stevens, his hit on Paul Kariya after Kariya had already shot the puck would be closer to the mark.</p>
