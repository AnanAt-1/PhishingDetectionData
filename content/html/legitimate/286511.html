 <h3>A <I><a href="/gurps/">GURPS</a></I> adventure by <A HREF="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/blue.htm">S.
 John Ross</A></h3></center>
 
 <P>Pawnshop is an Illuminated/Weird Occult adventure for a small group
 of modern adventurers of 50-150 points each. The text assumes that the
 PCs are known for their interest in the unusual or otherworldly, and that
 they are either "for hire" or have sufficient reputation to be
 sought out when an unusual case presents itself. The adventure is set in
 and around Washington, D.C. (in Georgetown, specifically), but can easily
 be transplanted to any modern city. Only the <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Basic/">GURPS Basic Set</a></I></B>
 is necessary for play.</P>
 
 <P>Note that one or two PCs with some low-power Psi or magic are appropriate
 to the genre, following the suggestions for "psychic investigators"
 on p. B165 (sidebar). In fact, the GM may wish to encourage one PC to have
 a little Psychometry, as this power is useful for feeding the party information
 the GM wants them to have.</P>
 
 <H3>Background</H3>
 
 <P>Washington, D.C.'s Georgetown district is known for its "college
 town" atmosphere - art galleries, alternative theaters, expensive
 shops, and a strong streak of new-age sensibility permeate the northwestern
 end of M Street. Weekend evenings find the streets crowded and festive,
 and the local intellectuals retreat into coffeehouse booths to savagely
 ponder verities over tense games of chess.<IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/glass.jpg" ALT="bits of molten glass" HEIGHT=116 WIDTH=99 ALIGN=LEFT></P>
 
 <P>Just out of reach of the lights of M Street is a tiny shop of the kind
 that can only thrive in this kind of atmosphere: Emperor Baxley's Pawn
 Shop, possibly the only pawn shop in the country specializing in occult
 paraphernalia. Next to the predictable stacks of stereos and glass cases
 of cheap firearms, the casual browser will spot hand-painted Tarot decks,
 seemingly ancient manuscripts (carefully crafted by a local artist), crystal
 balls, pewter pentagrams, and suggestive candlesticks engraved with pagan
 slogans. The choicest items - the truly unusual - "Emperor" Baxley
 saves for himself, or puts on display without a price tag. Karl Baxley
 profits from the occasional poverty of the local new-agers, and over the
 years has accumulated a few items worthy of the attention of the Secret
 Masters. One of them - an alien artifact meant to be used as a communications
 device - is being used by Baxley to control minds at a distance, and to
 commit murder.</P>
 
 <H3>The Plea for Help</H3>
 
 <P>The PCs are contacted by Karen Kessler, a resident of Crystal City,
 Virginia, with a request for their services as investigators of the unusual.
 She will call first, and request a meeting in-person, in a public place
 such as a restaurant. On the phone, she sounds nervous, and gives only
 her name and her assurance that she is "very serious, and very concerned,
 and willing to pay." She will not elaborate on her problem until the
 PCs meet her face to face.</P>
 
 <P>Karen <I>looks</I> like she's normally cheerful, but her face is tired-looking,
 now, with sunken eyes under large sunglasses, and a weary frown. Her husband
 died nine days ago, and the police have effectively closed the case as
 a suicide. Karen disagrees, and tells her story:</P>
 
 <P><IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/ronfall.jpg" ALT="Ron Kessler plunging to his doom. Ow." HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=551 WIDTH=216 ALIGN=RIGHT><I>Ron
 <B>wasn't</B> suicidal. We were both very happy and things were going fine.
 I know that something was done to him to make him do what he did . . .</I></P>
 
 <P><I>I was with him, at home, the night he died. We had just got back
 from a day in the city, doing some shopping and visiting his parents. We
 had stayed out a little late drinking in Georgetown and we were both a
 little buzzed, but neither of us were drunk, since his mother had been
 with us . . .</I></P>
 
 <P><I>When we got home, we were unwinding, relaxing together on the couch,
 when he went crazy. He started shaking, and then looked at me with the
 eyes of . . . the eyes of a different man. He started laughing and screaming
 things. Pointless, ridiculous things about glory and - I'm <B>really</B>
 not making this up - how he was going to get rid of the Senate!</I></P>
 
 <P><I>I tried to calm him down, give him something more to drink, get his
 mind off whatever had gotten into him, but he wouldn't have it. He grabbed
 me and smiled and said that now he finally had the power he deserved .
 . . and then he just ran out to the balcony and jumped off, laughing.</I></P>
 
 <P><I>It wasn't him. I don't know about things like this. I don't <B>believe</B>
 in things like this. But something killed my husband. He wasn't himself,
 and he wasn't crazy.</I></P>
 
 <P>The GM should note that her story doesn't flow smoothly. Karen will
 take long pauses to collect herself, and her mind will sometimes wander,
 her speech following it into incoherence. She will also explain that both
 her lawyer and her doctors have advised against doing what she's doing
 now - pursuing a private investigation of her husband's death.</P>
 
 <P>But she insists firmly that her husband was somehow literally not himself.
 She will ask the PCs for their rates of service, and try to meet them,
 but she has only $1,200 available in spendable savings, and will prefer
 to offer $60 a day. She will promise the PCs more money later, as she gets
 it, and will be willing to sign a contract to the effect that she can be
 billed for reasonable expenses. The GM should portray Karen as sympathetic,
 if necessary tugging personal strings of the characters to get them to
 agree to take her case. If the GM suspects his players will be especially
 resistant, Karen could be replaced by one of the PC's Dependents, or by
 a close friend of the party from previous adventures.</P>
 
 <H3>Ron Kessler's Death</H3>
 
 <P>The Kessler "suicide" is meant only as the adventure's teaser,
 so the GM shouldn't make it too challenging. It should draw the players
 in and pique their interest, not discourage them. The following are the
 likely avenues of investigation, and their potential results. Note that
 at some point after they go to the police, the PCs will be followed and
 attacked (see <I>Sergeant Henle,</I> below).</P>
 
 <P><B>Rosalyn Kessler:</B> Ron Kessler's mother was with the couple on
 the Saturday night that Kessler leaped to his death, and with Karen again
 later that night when she heard the news about her son. She lives in Maryland,
 just outside of the District, in a high-security apartment complex. She
 is unlikely to trust the PCs if they turn up cold, but will talk to them
 (reluctantly) if Karen calls ahead. She believes that Ron committed suicide,
 and possibly that he was mentally ill. She'll describe the day of the suicide:
 The trio had lunch at her apartment, then went into the city shopping,
 first in D.C.'s miniature Chinatown, and then onto Georgetown, where they
 parked at a distance and walked most of M street, hitting nearly every
 shop they could. While she remembers that they visited Emperor Baxley's,
 and that she found it unsettling and wanted to leave, it doesn't stand
 out as a relevant detail, and she had similar impressions of half the places
 they visited. Even if questioned directly about the shop, it will have
 to be described as "the occult pawnshop" or somesuch, since she
 doesn't remember the name. She <I>does</I> confirm Karen's assertion that
 Ron seemed happy and content with his life, but will likely not confide
 in the PCs with her true belief: that Ron was for some reason unhappy with
 his marriage. She blames Karen, but doesn't really acknowledge this consciously,
 herself.</P>
 
 <P><B>The City Police and/or Morgue:</B> If the PCs are private investigators
 licensed in the state of Virginia, or have police Contacts that are appropriate,
 getting the information on the Kessler case will be reasonably simple.
 If they are simply independent operators, some "social engineering"
 will be necessary, possibly in the form of lies or bribes. This is one
 case where Karen will be of no real help; the police are already leery
 of Mrs. Kessler due to her steady hounding of them over the past week since
 the death was officially declared a suicide.</P>
 
 <P>The official reports contain all the data on the body, but the body
 itself wasn't revealing. The fall killed Kessler; there were no unusual
 drugs present in the body, no injuries not attributable to the fall, and
 not even enough alcohol to count him as a drunk. But the police report
 <I>does</I> contain a vital clue: A few feet away from the body was the
 shattered remains of one of the knickknacks Kessler purchased in Georgetown:
 glass painted with many colors, which Karen identified as having been a
 small goblet. This is a detail that Karen remembers (Ron was clutching
 it throughout his tirade), but she didn't consider it important - it was
 just what he happened to be holding, as far as she is concerned. At this
 point, the PCs might agree.</P>
 
 <P>If at any point the PCs decide that the glass is important (and they
 should, fairly soon), careful questioning will reveal two <I>other</I>
 recent cases where painted glass items were found near bodies. One was
 a car accident on the Capitol Beltway, where the dead driver had a painted
 shotglass in his <I>mouth,</I> and another was chalked up as a drug-related
 homicide, where one of the victims was carrying a painted-glass pipe. Investigation
 into that incident will reveal that the victim in question is the one who
 started the gunfight.</P>
 
 <P><B>The Kessler Apartment:</B> Shopping bags from the entire shopping
 trip can be found, but again, Baxley's place is just one of many. The bag
 might be useful later, however, since it has the address clearly printed
 on it. The Kesslers were comfortably middle class (Karen works at a nearby
 college library, Ron was a construction foreman), and their home reflected
 ordinary tastes, but contains no evidence of what might drive a man to
 suicide. Use of Psychometry in the living room or on the balcony will pick
 up a troubled "vibe" from the night of the suicide, and the Psi
 <I>will</I> get the impression that some other presence was at work, implying
 that Ron didn't kill himself of his own volition.</P>
 
 <P><IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/grail.jpg" ALT="A goblet touched by the Dero. Icky." HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=299 WIDTH=216 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Other
 Tenants in the Building:</B> The Kessler's had neighbors only on one side
 of their 12th-floor condominium: Kevin Wayler and his young wife, Yvonne.
 They are a polite couple, happy to be helpful, but they only remember that
 there was screaming next door, most of it Ron's. They will also point out
 that they had never heard that kind of yelling from their neighbors before.</P>
 
 <H3>The Stained-Glass Grail</H3>
 
 <P>The shards of glass found near Kessler's body are very significant,
 although this will not be immediately apparent to the PCs.</P>
 
 <P>Several months ago, an impoverished youngster entered Baxley's emporium
 with the find of a lifetime: a large goblet made of multifaceted colored
 glass which seemed to capture and magnify ambient light. The youth explained
 that the goblet had once been the property of his great-grandmother, who
 told him that she used its magic to help their family. The boy didn't believe
 in magic, but he believed in his electric bill, and was willing to part
 with it for a reasonable sum.</P>
 
 <P>Baxley, raking over the strange goblet with a jeweler's loupe, didn't
 even haggle the asked price, fascinated as he was with the the material,
 which clearly wasn't glass, but some kind of fused collection of gems.
 He closed his shop early that evening, to take it upstairs to his apartment
 to examine it over a few beers. The first thing he did was to wash it out
 in the sink - it was still covered in cobwebs and dust.</P>
 
 <P>When he poured the water out of it, it wasn't water anymore. What emerged
 from the goblet was like melted glass, but cool to the touch. Frightened
 but fascinated, Baxley found that he could mold the material into nearly
 anything, and that it would harden permanently after a few minutes.</P>
 
 <P>He also found, after he had saturated himself with alcohol and constructed
 half a dozen cups and crude statues, that by holding his "gemstone
 Grail" and concentrating, he could make his new glass artifacts glow
 with warm light. As the hours wore on, the goblet's magic reached out and
 touched Baxley's mind.</P>
 
 <P>Baxley's "Grail" was an entity, an ancient product of alien
 sorcery from the days before the glory of Atlantis. Built originally to
 help form a network of communication between alien minds, it can be utilized
 by a human Telepath to reach out through it's "glass" creations
 to read and control minds. Baxley was only a latent Psi, but that was enough
 (see Baxley's character description for details of the Grail's powers).</P>
 
 <H3>Karl "Emperor" Baxley<IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/karl.jpg" ALT=""I'll tempt them with some Tso . . ."" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=308 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=RIGHT></H3>
 
 <P>Occult pawn-shop owner, black, age 43, 5'9", 260 lbs., impressive
 smile, wears boots, blue jeans, and an Irish sweater. Carries a riding
 crop and calls himself "emperor of the Occult World."</P>
 
 <P>ST 8, DX 10, IQ 11, HT 10.</P>
 
 <P>Basic Speed 5.0; Move 2 (Heavy Encumbrance from Fat disadvantage)</P>
 
 <P>Dodge 2; Parry NA; Block NA</P>
 
 <P>Damage: <I>Thrust</I> 1d-3; <I>Swing</I> 1d-2.</P>
 
 <P>Armor: None</P>
 
 <P><I>Advantages:</I> Empathy, Danger Sense, Luck (Twice Per Session).</P>
 
 <P><I>Disadvantages:</I> Delusion ("I am reincarnated from all the
 great emperors of Rome"), Fat, Paranoia. Due to the influence of the
 Grail, Karl is even <I>more</I> insane, having gained the Sadism disadvantage.</P>
 
 <P><I>Psi Powers:</I> Through his "Grail," Baxley has the equivalent
 of Telepathy Power 21, with all Telepathy skills at 17 (see the <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Basic/">GURPS
 Basic Set,</a></I></B> chapter 20, or <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Psionics/">GURPS Psionics</a></I></B> if available).
 These skills only work while Baxley is holding the Grail, and only work
 on subjects with one of his alien-glass creations either in hand or kept
 close on their persons (in a pocket will do).</P>
 
 <P>Furthermore, the Grail grants him the power to immediately sense when
 there are "victims" available (such as when anyone is touching
 one of his painted-glass pieces). The only other difference from the normal
 Psi rules is the nature of the Telecontrol: the victim has total memory
 of the events, but is <I>convinced that the decisions were his own.</I>
 Had Ron Kessler been interviewed as he dived to the blacktop, he would
 have rationalized his suicide on the way down.</P>
 
 <P>The potential Telepathy power-level is actually much higher; Baxley
 is still becoming accustomed to the device.</P>
 
 <P><I>Quirks:</I> Affects an "imperious" air - including occasional
 dips into ridiculous melodrama; talks to his pet baby kangaroo; delights
 in his newfound power and actively seeks "worthy foes."</P>
 
 <P><I>Notable Skills:</I> Accounting-11, Computer Operation/TL7-11, Detect
 Lies-10, Driving/TL7 (Automobile)-9, History-10, Hobby Skill (Book Restoration)-11,
 Hobby Skill (Glass Painting)-11, Literature-10, Merchant-14, Occultism-13,
 Sign Language (AMESLAN)-10.</P>
 
 <P>Karl Baxley has long been regarded by his friends as a likable and only
 occasionally intolerable eccentric. Every-body <I>knows</I> he's crazy,
 and that his speeches about the glory of Rome are more than just fun, but
 he always seemed basically harmless before he purchased the Device from
 a down-on-his-luck collector who had no idea what it did.</P>
 
 <P>When roleplaying Karl, the GM should slip into melodramatic tirades
 at random, then drop back into what is essentially reasonable speech. Throughout
 the adventure, note that his pawnshop is "Closed Due To Vacation"
 - Karl is addicted to his new power, and spends most of his waking hours
 in his apartment, using it.</P>
 
 <H3>Sergeant Henle</H3>
 
 <P>One of the policemen on the scene when Kessler jumped to his death was
 Sergeant Paul Henle. It was Henle who handled the broken glass goblet,
 and Henle who was responsible for bagging it and turning it over as evidence.
 Under the control of Emperor Baxley, he kept a single piece, and keeps
 it in his shirt pocket at all times. As a result, Karl has a policeman
 he can use.</P>
 
 <P>In game terms, Paul Henle is an ordinary man: ST 10, DX 10, IQ 10, HT
 10, with a Move (and all derivatives) of 5 and skills of 9 to 12 in ordinary
 modern things like driving and bicycling. He has Guns/TL7 (Pistol)-13 and
 carries a standard issue .45 ACP. Nothing extraordinary, but the badge
 - and his subsequent ability to gain entry (or just respect) by intimidation
 - makes him a favorite of Karl's pawns. Karl <I>likes</I> playing cop.</P>
 
 <P><IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/glass.jpg" ALT="Same glass as before" HEIGHT=116 WIDTH=99 ALIGN=RIGHT>When
 the PCs go to the authorities to ask about Kessler's death, Sergeant Henle
 will be present. Henle will, at the time, be under the control of Emperor
 Baxley, who spends more and more time controlling the policeman. After
 the PCs get the information they came for, Henle will follow the PCs from
 a distance, and pick an opportunity to try to kill them. Baxley is insane
 but not <I>stupid,</I> and he will play a waiting game if need be to get
 the PCs stopped, alone, and vulnerable - and then he'll open up with the
 pistol.</P>
 
 <P>By this point, the concept that Kessler was possessed or controlled
 in some way should have definitely been in the air (a casual passer-by
 or nosy taxi driver will bring it up at some point, if the PCs are being
 especially thick). So, the PCs should have a reason <I>not</I> to just
 dive for cover and return a hail of lead at the offending peace officer.
 The hard cover is a good idea, though. Henle will take it himself, when
 it comes time to reload. Ideally, Henle will be incapacitated and captured,
 but not killed. Again, ideally, the shard of glass in his shirtpocket should
 be found, providing a clue.</P>
 
 <P>Keeping a captured or injured policeman will prove to be a major complication
 - if he's conscious, Baxley will speak through him, trying to manipulate
 the PCs to a place where he has other minions to ambush them, or (if he's
 feeling particularly playful) simply to humiliate them. If the cop is unconscious
 or dead, simply turning him <I>back</I> over to the authorities is a dangerous
 thing: when Henle awakes, he will try to justify his actions, even if he
 is uncontrolled at the time. And even if he never wakes up, explaining
 a dead or injured cop is trouble. Most likely, the PCs will have to keep
 him prisoner someplace for the duration.</P>
 
 <P>The purpose of this encounter is threefold: First, it should clearly
 establish that the PCs have a <I>foe.</I> The investigation is no longer
 a safe one. Second, it should hint that there is some link between what
 is happening and bits of painted glass. Finally, it puts two complicated
 things in the hands of the PCs: a cop who shouldn't be there, and a piece
 of the glass.</P>
 
 <H3>Roman Ruins</H3>
 
 <P>The line about destroying the Senate is a tease; Karl doesn't have any
 concern with the U.S. Government now that he is convinced he can start
 ruling the world directly. It's a reference to the <I>Roman</I> Senate,
 which "Emperor" Karl has a personal grudge against for reasons
 he could explain for hours. When the PCs encounter other pawns of Baxley,
 the GM should toss in more Roman references now and again. See <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/ImperialRome/">GURPS
 Imperial Rome</a></I></B> if you want to get detailed, but in a pinch Karl
 will just loudly complain about the ineptitude of the emperors that he's
 decided he isn't a reincarnation of.</P>
 
 <H3>Glass Pawns</H3>
 
 <P>Over the past few weeks, Karl has picked up a <I>lot</I> of potential
 pawns. He uses the glass-pouring properties of the Grail to churn out tons
 of tiny trinkets, which he then paints colorfully as a kind of "instant
 art" to sell inexpensively in his shop, and to other local vendors.
 As a result, he has literally hundreds of "agents" potentially
 under his control. By making his victims vocally declare the glass trinkets
 "lucky charms" while under his control, the rationalizing side-effects
 of the Grail's special Telecontrol insure that most people who own one
 of Baxley's painted-glass masterpieces keep it handy at all times . . .</P>
 
 <P>This is a tool for the GM, who will need to improvise encounters as
 the investigation moves the PCs closer and closer to Baxley. Since Georgetown
 is visited by tourists of all kinds daily, any sort of person might conceivably
 have purchased or found one of the glass baubles.</P>
 
 <P>All the GM needs to keep in mind is that everyone the PCs meet who are
 under Karl's control act like Karl. They <I>are</I> Karl. When they see
 a little old lady in a sun-bonnet shake her fist at them and shout "Drat!!!"
 in a villainous cackle, this should be a Big Clue that the possession line
 is the real one.</P>
 
 <P>Karl is <I>seriously</I> Paranoid. Once he finds out that one of his
 killings is being investigated, he will become obsessed with the PCs. If
 the PCs have a piece of his glass, he will attempt to control one of <I>them.</I></P>
 
 <P>At first, Karl will attempt to be subtle and murderous - not directly
 challenging the party, but trying to lead them into areas where he can
 hurt them. It won't be very long, however, before he just goes into a tirade.
 He will never actually identify himself (unless the PCs are at a total
 loss to track him down and the pacing needs a kick of adrenaline), but
 he will drop any pretense of being anything but somebody possessing the
 minds of his victims.</P>
 
 <P>Note that the normal penalties to multiple Telecontrol attempts apply;
 Karl will have two or three simultaneous pawns at most, and usually only
 one at a time. His supply of people who own guns or other weapons is extremely
 short - but he has plenty of pawns who are capable of car chases and hit-and-run
 attempts!</P>
 
 <H3>Setting Up the Challenge</H3>
 
 <P>The GM should aim for a subtly creepy atmosphere. The investigators
 are being stalked by a madman's mind. Furthermore, they may have an increasingly
 large pile of tied-up bodies, and a boxful of colorful glass junk.</P>
 
 <P>All of this should, in short order, lead the PCs directly to the lair
 of the enemy. Divination or psychic examination using the glass shards
 themselves can provide a direct route, if the GM is feeling generous -
 but remember that physical contact with the glass puts the PCs in immediate
 peril of control.</P>
 
 <P>More likely, interviews with victims will lead a painted-glass trail
 to Georgetown, and a showdown on M Street. In enough time to include some
 interesting encounters, but not so much time that it frustrates, the PCs
 should eventually find out that all that colored glass comes from Emperor
 Baxley's Pawn Shop.</P>
 
 <H3><IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/shop.jpg" ALT="Baxley's Georgetown Headquarters" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=355 WIDTH=356 ALIGN=LEFT>Baxley's
 Emporium</H3>
 
 <P>A narrow two-story building sandwiched between a comic book store and
 a consignment clothes shop, the pawnshop has windows full of lurid esoterica,
 from used books of modern magic to cheap statuary, human skulls from medical
 supply houses, and crystal and pewter enough to supply the free world for
 decades. A sign on the door is written in flowing calligraphic script:
 <B>Closed Due to Vacation.</B> At night, the only light is on the second
 story, where Karl lives.</P>
 
 <H3>Ground Floor</H3>
 
 <P><B>The Front Door:</B> Flaked green paint, with bars behind the windows.
 There is a +2 bonus to pick the lock; it's cheap and old. Note that breaking
 in through the windows works fine if the PCs have some way past the bars.
 Karl once bought an alarm system for insurance reasons, but it no longer
 works. He trusts some painted charms on the bars to protect him from theft,
 but they have no real magic in them whatsoever.</P>
 
 <P><B>The Pawnshop:</B> Emperor Baxley's Pawn Shop resembles a cross between
 an ordinary pawnbroker's and a crowded occult bookstore. If the PCs need
 to stock up on their aromatherapy supplies, used audiocassettes and video
 games, postcards featuring paintings of naked women wrapped around asteroids,
 wedding rings, or pewter unicorns, this is their chance (the total value
 of the jewelry - if sold at another pawn shop, comes to less than $800.00).</P>
 
 <P>The GM should feel free to improvise if the PCs want to get a chuckle
 out of browsing, but the only really unusual thing they might notice is
 a large cat-bed with a blanket in it. Hanging over it is a recent photo
 of Karl hugging his pet baby kangaroo, Gimpy Shawn.</P>
 
 <P>There is a display shelf full of colorful painted glass items: bowls,
 plates, goblets, pipes, picture frames, and more. These are all made from
 the alien glass, and touching them will alert Karl instantly, and open
 the PC who touches them to control.</P>
 
 <P><B>Behind the Counter:</B> There is a 12-gauge under the counter, but
 it's cheap, and has been loaded with the same shells for seven years. Use
 the M870 stats from the <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Basic/">GURPS Basic Set</a></I> </B>weapons tables, but
 the gun has a malfunction number of 13. Also behind the counter is access
 to the many guns for sale (the keys are on Karl's personal keyring, but
 the glass is breakable). Baxley doesn't stock any ammunition, however.
 He directs any firearms customers to a local sporting goods store. Next
 to the shotgun is a small can of pepper-spray.</P>
 
 <P><B>The Storeroom:</B> Karl Baxley has, unwittingly, made himself a minor
 Secret Master. He has pawns, a plot to take over the world, and a miniature,
 private Warehouse 23. In addition to crates of more of the same junk found
 outside (including piles of stereos and televisions that Karl plans to
 someday sell for scrap), there are valuable things here. And dangerous
 things. If the PCs have the ability to detect magical or psychic emanations,
 they will find one or two of them here. They are unknown to Karl. The nature
 of what can be found is left to the GM, since any "magic items"
 introduced into a long-running campaign should be hand-picked. The Occult
 section of <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Warehouse23/">GURPS Warehouse 23</a></I></B> can easily be mined for possibilities.
 Perhaps Karl got the Crystal Skull for $7.50 at a yard sale, or has Aaron's
 Rod propped up against the wall. Items such as the Crystal Bell and an
 Oracle Gem are more likely - and just as dangerous (see <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Warehouse23/">Warehouse
 23</a></I>,</B> Chapter 3).</P>
 
 <P><B>The Stairs:</B> There is a single, wooden, unlocked door concealing
 this narrow stair. It leads upstairs, past a window and onto the apartment
 landing (see below).</P>
 
 <H3>Upstairs Apartment</H3>
 
 <P><B>The Landing:</B> The door here is unlocked.</P>
 
 <P><B>The Livingroom/Kitchen:</B> There is a desk here, with a personal
 computer and a dangerously leaning stack of new-age books on it. The computer
 is off, but (if it becomes important) is a pretty up-to-speed machine complete
 with a modem and Karl's account on a local net server. His password is
 kept conveniently in his communication software if anyone thinks to look.
 He has no email waiting. There is also a dingy couch, a beaten-up coffeetable,
 a <IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/glass.jpg" ALT="Almost identical glass" HEIGHT=116 WIDTH=99 ALIGN=LEFT>color
 TV set and VCR (the pick of the stock from downstairs - both very nice),
 three different-colored lava lamps, and a kitchenette with a small stove
 and a microwave. Judging from the contents of the kitchen, Karl exists
 entirely on frozen convenience foods, fruit punch flavored soda, and Pop-Tarts.</P>
 
 <P>When the PCs arrive at this area, Karl will be in the livingroom only
 if the PCs have been clever enough to sneak in entirely unobserved. Considering
 the level of obsessive observation the party has been under, this would
 require some excellent planning. Most likely, Karl will be holed up in
 the bedroom ready to defend himself, with a mind-controlled drone sneaking
 up the steps behind the party carrying the shotgun from under the cash
 register (if the PCs didn't take it).</P>
 
 <P><B>The Bathroom:</B> An ordinary bathroom. The seat is up. The shower
 curtain has Snoopy on it.</P>
 
 <P><B>The Bedroom:</B> The Emperor is most likely here, sitting with his
 pet kangaroo (who looks either frightened or bored; it's hard to tell which),
 and holding the "Grail" in one hand and a Beretta 9mm in the
 other (remember that Karl uses guns at default). The bedroom itself contains
 bookshelves to the ceiling, books overflowing, clothes on the floor, and
 a large waterbed.</P>
 
 <H3>The Final Conflict</H3>
 
 <P>How the showdown runs depends entirely on the previous jockeying between
 the madman and the player characters. If Karl Baxley had his way, it would
 go exactly like this:</P>
 
 <P>Phase One: The PCs, shadowed by a particularly skilled and dangerous
 pawn (one of the criminals or cops Karl can grab, if possible - somebody
 with their own gun and the skill to use it), break into the pawnshop and
 sneak their way up the stairs, thinking they have the drop on Karl.</P>
 
 <P>Phase Two: Karl hits the PCs from both sides, catching them in a hail
 of skillfully-slung lead from both in front (when they open the bedroom
 door) and behind (from the ace-in-the-hole assassin). The last sight the
 pesky PCs see is Karl, grinning and pouring cool glass and playing with
 it.</P>
 
 <P>Phase Three: The PCs' bodies are tossed into the nearby canal, and Karl
 goes on to systematically implement his plan to Rule the World.</P>
 
 <P>What actually happens depends on the PCs. But keep in mind the penalty
 Karl will take for controlling the drone and firing his own gun. He's not
 likely to hit much. Another point to remember is the Grail itself - it's
 not impossible to target (-6 to be hit for size), and it's fragile. It
 has DR 1 and HT 2. A single point of damage past the DR will crack it;
 another will destroy it utterly. If that happens, even Karl will become
 merely eccentric again.</P>
 
 <H3>Wrapup, Ramifications, and Crossovers</H3>
 
 <P>There are many loose ends that need to be tied up. In an ongoing campaign,
 some of them can become major plot points. In a one-night adventure, they
 can be glossed over in the closing narration by the Game Master. The most
 important is the many scarred lives and deaths that the adventure will
 potentially produce. This isn't an adventure about bloodshed; it's about
 a single madman, and everybody else who attacks the PCs is an innocent
 victim. Hopefully, the PCs didn't blow them mindlessly away. If they did,
 show them a little less mercy in the final scene. He who lives by the sword
 . . . But, keep it entertaining in any case.</P>
 
 <P>If the Grail survives the encounter (and it's a great target for one
 of those final stray shots - give it a dramatic slow-motion death), then
 it's potentially dangerous not only to the campaign, but also to the PCs.
 It warps the intentions of the users. No longer a benevolent tool for communication,
 is is touched by the minds of the Dero (see <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Warehouse23/">GURPS Warehouse 23</a></I></B>)
 who used it for evil. Whether it's "magic" or "super technology"
 is almost a moot point. <IMG SRC="/pyramid/gifbin/p23/glass.jpg" ALT="But it's COOL glass . . ." HEIGHT=116 WIDTH=99 ALIGN=RIGHT>It
 runs on life-giving Orgone energy, however, and Karl has taken the equivalent
 of nearly 200 rads of radiation damage from it! Anyone possessing the Grail
 takes a rad per day of exposure, because of the flow of negative Orgone.</P>
 
 <P>The adventure can be retooled to any contemporary or futuristic setting,
 from <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Autoduel/">Autoduel</a></I> </B>to <B><I><a href="/gurps/books/Space/">Space,</a></I> </B>with no troubles. It
 even easily adapts to historical settings and fantasy campaigns - the only
 real difference is the TL of the weapons involved, and the way Ron Kessler
 died (a leap from the 12th floor is unlikely in medieval Prague). The PCs
 can also easily be policemen or government agents - anyone who might be
 called in to look at the curious nature of Ron Kessler's death. </P>
