2010-11 season will be remembered as a year of near-misses in coach <a class="biolink" href="/coaches.aspx?rc=91">Greg McDermott</a>'s first year on the Creighton sideline, but also one in which the fan base was rejuvenated by an influx of players and coaches who helped continue one of the most successful runs in MVC history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDermott won 23 games, most ever by a first-year coach at Creighton, but six losses by three points or less left one to wonder what could have been had the ball bounced the Jays way on a few more occasions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a four-year run at Iowa State, McDermott was hired in April of 2010 with the tough task of replacing <a class="biolink" href="/coaches.aspx?rc=3">Dana Altman</a>, who accepted a similar job at Oregon. Little did both men know that their paths would cross again to end the first season on the job for both.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his hiring, McDermott announced that his son, <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=580">Doug McDermott</a>, had been released from his signed letter-of-intent at Northern Iowa and would be coming to Creighton. The proclamation received only modest attention at the time, but when all was said and done <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=580">Doug McDermott</a> had one of the best debut seasons in Missouri Valley Conference history as he became the first freshman in 59 years to earn first-team all-Valley honors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton opened the year with a three-game homestand, including two games in the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge. Creighton dispatched Alabama State in coach McDermott's regular-season debut on the Bluejay bench on Nov. 12th, scored the final four points to beat Northern Arizona on Nov. 14th, and topped Louisiana on Nov. 17th, to start 3-0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led Creighton into a Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge title tilt vs. coach McDermott's former school, Iowa State, in Des Moines. Both teams scored at will, shooting more than 50 percent from the field and three-point arc, while owning less than 10 turnovers each. Creighton trailed by five in the final 20 seconds, but tied it with 1.6 seconds left on two free throws by <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=585">Antoine Young</a>. ISU big man Jamie Vanderbeken would then catch the inbounds pass, take two dribbles and drain a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cyclones the win. Officials called the shot good, and without a courtside television monitor to confirm, left the court to end the game. It wasn't until minutes later that photographs surfaced that showed the shot should not have counted since time expired with the ball still in Vanderbeken's hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a win over Kennesaw State, Creighton suffered its only three-game losing streak of the season. Creighton lost at Northwestern before dropping a home game against No. 21 BYU despite holding eventual National Player of the Year Jimmer Fredette to a season-low 13 points. Creighton's losing streak was extended when Nebraska overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to topple the Jays, 59-54, in Lincoln. Creighton's <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=578">Kenny Lawson Jr.</a> had a three-point shot to tie it in the final 10 seconds that was off the mark, and Nebraska scored the final points on a lay-up in the last second after the Jays crashed the boards with all five men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton answered the three-game losing streak with a season-best six-game winning streak. Lawson's monster game of 30 points and 18 rebounds helped lead the Jays to a 82-75 win over Saint Joseph's, which also included 22 points off the bench from a red-hot <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=584">Ethan Wragge</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The December 18th win over Idaho State featured the highly-anticipated debut of sophomore center <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=572">Gregory Echenique</a>. A transfer from Rutgers, Echenique had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots after becoming eligible the day after the first semester ended on the Creighton campus. Creighton then beat Western Illinois and Samford to enter Missouri Valley Conference play with an 8-4 mark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton entered league play on the road with a 64-53 win at Illinois State before returning home to post a 16-point triumph over Drake. Creighton then dropped a rare home game with a 67-55 loss to Missouri State, the eventual regular-season champ in the MVC.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jays then took the road to pick up an overtime win at Southern Illinois, followed by a five-point win at Evansville, to stand at 4-1 in league play. CU dropped to 4-2 in league play with a home loss to Wichita State on Jan. 12th, the Shockers first win in Omaha since 1992.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton went on the road at Indiana State on Jan. 16th and suffered a loss at the buzzer. With the score tied and time winding down, Creighton forced a contested airball by Jake Odum as time wound down, only to have Carl Richard follow Odum's miss with an over-the-shoulder tip-in that beat the buzzer, and the Jays, 61-59.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home to beat Bradley before another heart-breaking road loss. The Jays led Missouri State nearly wire-to-wire, only to miss some late free throws and allow a game-deciding lay-up to league Player of the Year Kyle Weems with 14.2 seconds left. Creighton would turn the ball over on its ensuing possession, losing 67-66 in an intense JQH Arena environment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days after the MSU loss, Creighton went to the old stomping ground of coach McDermott, and the school that his son Doug had signed with, Northern Iowa. A nationally-televised audience saw Creighton hang with UNI, but lost to the hot-shooting Panthers by five in another tight road setback.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home on Jan. 29 to avenge its road loss to Indiana State, only to sputter away from home with a loss to a last-place Bradley team. Just hours before the scheduled 7 pm tipoff, the start time was moved up to 3 pm due to a blizzard that shut down the city of Peoria. Fewer than 800 fans were in the facility by tip-off for the rare Tuesday afternoon start.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again Creighton responded from a tough road loss with a home win, this time beating Evansville. However, the road frustrations continued, as Drake edged Creighton 67-64 when Young's game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton came back home to beat Southern Illinois and Illinois State, only to lose at Akron in a non-televised BracketBusters game. Creighton returned to league play with a game at Wichita State. With the score tied late, WSU's Aaron Ellis hit a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left to hand CU another frustrating road loss, 67-65.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton closed the regular-season with an eight-point win over Northern Iowa. That win secured a 15th straight season of 10 or more league wins as well as a 14th straight finish of fourth place or better in Valley play.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton's reward for its Senior Day win over Northern Iowa was a rematch with the Panthers six days later. Creighton topped the Panthers, 60-57 in St. Louis, after UNI star Kwadzo Ahelegbe missed a last-second three-pointer that could have sent the contest to overtime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton's tournament title quest ended in the semifinal round against top-seeded Missouri State, 60-50. The Jays led 30-25 at the half before a stifling MSU defense controlled the second stanza.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton accepted a bid to the College Basketball Invitational, a 16-team tournament in its fourth year of existence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton fell behind 16-7 in the opening minutes of its first-round game vs. San Jose State, but&nbsp; eventually came back to post an 85-74 win over the Spartans. The second round was an offensive display for the ages, with the Jays eliminating Davidson, 102-92 in the highest-scoring game in CBI history.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Davidson win pushed Creighton into the semifinals, where it took on UCF. The Knights, which faced major travel issues and arrived just four hours prior to tip-off, were lethargic from the get-go and Creighton cruised to an 82-64 win to reach the unique best-of-3 championship series format.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton's opponent in the finals was Oregon, coached by Altman. A CBI record crowd of 12,381 turned out to see Creighton claim an 84-76 win over the Ducks and put CU just one win away from a postseason title.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The series shifted to Eugene for the second game, where Oregon dominated in a 71-58 contest that tied the series at 1-1. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third game, also played in Eugene, was everything a title game should be. The teams exchanged 14 leads and 10 ties, and the score was tied in the final 25 seconds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the shot clock off, Creighton intended to hold the ball for a final shot. But not long after an inbounds pass to Young, the junior point guard would step back over a nearly-invisible half-court line that gave Oregon the ball back with 17.2 seconds left. E.J. Singler would make the game-winning hoop with 2.0 seconds left, giving the Ducks the title in yet another excruciating road defeat for Creighton.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton finished the season 23-16 overall, including a school-record four postseason victories. <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=580">Doug McDermott</a> led the Jays with averages of 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.

In that contest, Creighton shot 21-39 from the floor and won the battle of the boards, 48-36. CU had won its previous 42 games with a +10 glass edge and 50% shooting from the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take things a step further, and you'll see that the loss on Jan. 26 was historic. It was the first time since the inception of the three-point shot (1986-87) that Creighton lost despite shooting 50 percent or better from both the floor and three-point arc, and also winning the boards by 10 or more. Creighton had been 9-0 previously when doing that, winning those games by an average of 27.0 points.<br><br>Lawson Was Up For Senior CLASS Award<br>Senior center <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=578">Kenny Lawson Jr.</a> was one of 30 candidates nationwide for the Senior CLASS Award.

Kyle Korver was a finalist for the award in 2003, while Anthony Tolliver was a finalist in 2007. Both were also named Senior CLASS All-Americans. In addition, Dane Watts was a candidate in 2008 but did not advance to the final stage. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton, which also has <a class="biolink" href="/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=1145617&DB_OEM_ID=1000">Sam Schuett</a> as a candidate for the women's award, is one of just five schools nationally (Creighton, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Lehigh and Duke) with a candidate on both the men's and women's side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2011 men's candidate class includes three CoSIDA Academic All-Americans from a year ago, nine student-athletes on the preseason watch list for the John R.

That mark was Creighton's largest margin since an identical +26 differential over Mississippi Valley State on Dec. 29, 2001 back when it played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton also held Samford to a season-low 40 points, which tied the fewest points ever in a Qwest Center Omaha game. Alcorn State also had 40 on Nov. 15, 2004.<br><br>Defensive Gem<br>Creighton held Samford to just 40 points on December 22nd. That was the best defensive effort by the Bluejays since limiting Indiana State to 38 points in an MVC Tournament quarterfinal victory on March 2, 2007.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton, which held Jim Molinari's Western Illinois club to 47 points on Dec. 20, held consecutive opponents under 50 points for the first time since Dec. 3-6, 2003.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 87 points allowed over those two games was the best stretch by Creighton in any set of back-to-back games since Dec. 5-9, 1958 (86).<br><br><a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=576">Josh Jones</a> Provides Offensive Boost<br>Sophomore <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=576">Josh Jones</a> entered the Dec. 29 game at Illinois State mired in a 9-of-38 shooting slump to start the season, including 0-of-16 from three-point range.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the Redbirds, Jones hit 2-of-3 shots from long-range, and he tied his season-high with six points. The Jays outscored ISU 15-10 in the 8:51 with Jones on the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Dec. 29th, Jones shot 51.8 percent from the field (57-110), including 47.1 percent from downtown (33-70).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton is 22-8 over the past two seasons when Jones scores five or more points, but 13-22 when he plays and doesn't score five points or more.<br><br>Echenique Debuts<br>Dec. 18 marked Creighton's first game with the services of <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=572">Gregory Echenique</a>, who was an ineligible transfer until Dec. 17. He became eligible at the end of Creighton's fall semester.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echenique, a 6'9&rdquo;, 270-pound center, came to Creighton after spending three semesters at Rutgers from 2008-09. He averaged 9.2 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots per game in 39 contests with the Scarlet Knights, which included 37 starts and an average of 27.5 minutes per game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots in 18 minutes vs. Idaho State in his Creighton debut. He followed that up with 16 points, four rebounds and four blocked shots in 21 minutes vs. Western Illinois. At the time, Echenique's four blocked shots on Dec. 20 were tied for the most in the MVC in any game this year by one player. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He owned the top two efforts this season in the MVC, with seven blocks at Missouri State (Jan. 22) after six at Indiana State (Jan. 16).<br><br>Red-Hot Start<br>Creighton made its first eight field goal attempts from the field to open its Dec. 18 win over Idaho State, with six of those shots coming from long-range. That helped Creighton build a 22-13 lead which it never surrendered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, it was the second straight game that Creighton had a stretch of six straight three-point attempts that were all made, having done it on six straight possessions vs. Saint Joseph's.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In eight seasons of games at Qwest Center Omaha (137 games), Creighton's best had been 6-for-6 starts from the floor vs. High Point (Dec. 2, 2004) and Illinois State (Jan. 22, 2005).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, this was just the seventh occasion all-time that Creighton had started as well as 4-for-4 from the field. Creighton started 5-for-5 vs. UCF on March 23, 2011 for its eighth 4-for-4 start, and 6-for-6 vs. Oregon on March 28, 2011 for its ninth 4-for-4 start or better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton is 55-for-137 all-time in its first shot of the game at Qwest Center Omaha, including a 7-for-22 mark this winter.<br><br>No TV, No Problem<br>Creighton is a perfect 45-0 in regular-season non-televised games at Qwest Center Omaha.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton has also won 27 straight non-televised home games at Qwest Center Omaha, dating to a March 20, 2006 loss to Miami (Fla.) in the NIT.<br><br>Practice Pays Off<br><a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=585">Antoine Young</a> is frequently the last player in the gym after practice, staying late to work on his shot.

This season, he shot 31.7 percent (39-123) from downtown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the line, Young entered the year as a 64.3 percent shooter (101-157). He was at 74.9 percent from the stripe (128-171) this year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young connected on a career-high four three-point attempts vs. Idaho State on Dec. 18. His 4-for-4 shooting from downtown was a Qwest Center Omaha record for three-point shots without a miss by a Bluejay, eclipsing previous 3-for-3 displays by Johnny Mathies, Pierce Hibma, Dane Watts and Booker Woodfox. <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=576">Josh Jones</a> tied that mark on March 21 vs. Davidson.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, his 10-for-10 marksmanship from the line on Jan. 1 vs. Drake was a Qwest Center Omaha record for most free throws in a game without a miss.<br><br>A Fan Of The A-10<br>Sophomore <a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=584">Ethan Wragge</a> had a career-high of 22 points on Dec. 11 vs. Saint Joseph's, eclipsing his previous best of 21 that came last year in 17 minutes vs. fellow Atlantic-10 power Xavier.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the game against Xavier, Wragge had his points in fewer than 20 minutes of playing time. When he did it last season, he became the first CU player to score more than 20 points in less than 20 minutes since Vernon Moore put up 21 points in 19 minutes against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 24, 1984.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In three career games against the Atlantic-10 Conference, Wragge has scored 54 points (18.0 ppg.) in 48 minutes (16.0 mpg.) of play, connecting on 14-of-24 three-point attempts (58.3 percent) and 18-of-28 shots overall (64.3 percent).<br><br>Solid Stretch<br><a class="biolink" href="/roster.aspx?rp_id=584">Ethan Wragge</a> will be hard-pressed to have a better four-minute stretch than what he had on Dec. 11 in a win over Saint Joseph's.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wragge drained consecutive three-pointers with 15:55, 15:10, 13:56, 13:06 and 12:26 left in the second half.

2010-11 season will be remembered as a year of near-misses in coach \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Fcoaches.aspx?rc=91\\"\u003EGreg McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\'s first year on the Creighton sideline, but also one in which the fan base was rejuvenated by an influx of players and coaches who helped continue one of the most successful runs in MVC history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDermott won 23 games, most ever by a first-year coach at Creighton, but six losses by three points or less left one to wonder what could have been had the ball bounced the Jays way on a few more occasions.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a four-year run at Iowa State, McDermott was hired in April of 2010 with the tough task of replacing \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Fcoaches.aspx?rc=3\\"\u003EDana Altman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who accepted a similar job at Oregon. Little did both men know that their paths would cross again to end the first season on the job for both.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his hiring, McDermott announced that his son, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, had been released from his signed letter-of-intent at Northern Iowa and would be coming to Creighton. The proclamation received only modest attention at the time, but when all was said and done \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E had one of the best debut seasons in Missouri Valley Conference history as he became the first freshman in 59 years to earn first-team all-Valley honors.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton opened the year with a three-game homestand, including two games in the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge. Creighton dispatched Alabama State in coach McDermott\'s regular-season debut on the Bluejay bench on Nov. 12th, scored the final four points to beat Northern Arizona on Nov. 14th, and topped Louisiana on Nov. 17th, to start 3-0.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led Creighton into a Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge title tilt vs. coach McDermott\'s former school, Iowa State, in Des Moines. Both teams scored at will, shooting more than 50 percent from the field and three-point arc, while owning less than 10 turnovers each. Creighton trailed by five in the final 20 seconds, but tied it with 1.6 seconds left on two free throws by \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=585\\"\u003EAntoine Young\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. ISU big man Jamie Vanderbeken would then catch the inbounds pass, take two dribbles and drain a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cyclones the win. Officials called the shot good, and without a courtside television monitor to confirm, left the court to end the game. It wasn\'t until minutes later that photographs surfaced that showed the shot should not have counted since time expired with the ball still in Vanderbeken\'s hand.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a win over Kennesaw State, Creighton suffered its only three-game losing streak of the season. Creighton lost at Northwestern before dropping a home game against No. 21 BYU despite holding eventual National Player of the Year Jimmer Fredette to a season-low 13 points. Creighton\'s losing streak was extended when Nebraska overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to topple the Jays, 59-54, in Lincoln. Creighton\'s \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=578\\"\u003EKenny Lawson Jr.\u003C\u002Fa\u003E had a three-point shot to tie it in the final 10 seconds that was off the mark, and Nebraska scored the final points on a lay-up in the last second after the Jays crashed the boards with all five men.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton answered the three-game losing streak with a season-best six-game winning streak. Lawson\'s monster game of 30 points and 18 rebounds helped lead the Jays to a 82-75 win over Saint Joseph\'s, which also included 22 points off the bench from a red-hot \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=584\\"\u003EEthan Wragge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The December 18th win over Idaho State featured the highly-anticipated debut of sophomore center \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=572\\"\u003EGregory Echenique\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. A transfer from Rutgers, Echenique had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots after becoming eligible the day after the first semester ended on the Creighton campus. Creighton then beat Western Illinois and Samford to enter Missouri Valley Conference play with an 8-4 mark.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton entered league play on the road with a 64-53 win at Illinois State before returning home to post a 16-point triumph over Drake. Creighton then dropped a rare home game with a 67-55 loss to Missouri State, the eventual regular-season champ in the MVC.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jays then took the road to pick up an overtime win at Southern Illinois, followed by a five-point win at Evansville, to stand at 4-1 in league play. CU dropped to 4-2 in league play with a home loss to Wichita State on Jan. 12th, the Shockers first win in Omaha since 1992.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton went on the road at Indiana State on Jan. 16th and suffered a loss at the buzzer. With the score tied and time winding down, Creighton forced a contested airball by Jake Odum as time wound down, only to have Carl Richard follow Odum\'s miss with an over-the-shoulder tip-in that beat the buzzer, and the Jays, 61-59.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home to beat Bradley before another heart-breaking road loss. The Jays led Missouri State nearly wire-to-wire, only to miss some late free throws and allow a game-deciding lay-up to league Player of the Year Kyle Weems with 14.2 seconds left. Creighton would turn the ball over on its ensuing possession, losing 67-66 in an intense JQH Arena environment.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days after the MSU loss, Creighton went to the old stomping ground of coach McDermott, and the school that his son Doug had signed with, Northern Iowa. A nationally-televised audience saw Creighton hang with UNI, but lost to the hot-shooting Panthers by five in another tight road setback.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home on Jan. 29 to avenge its road loss to Indiana State, only to sputter away from home with a loss to a last-place Bradley team. Just hours before the scheduled 7 pm tipoff, the start time was moved up to 3 pm due to a blizzard that shut down the city of Peoria. Fewer than 800 fans were in the facility by tip-off for the rare Tuesday afternoon start.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again Creighton responded from a tough road loss with a home win, this time beating Evansville. However, the road frustrations continued, as Drake edged Creighton 67-64 when Young\'s game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton came back home to beat Southern Illinois and Illinois State, only to lose at Akron in a non-televised BracketBusters game. Creighton returned to league play with a game at Wichita State. With the score tied late, WSU\'s Aaron Ellis hit a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left to hand CU another frustrating road loss, 67-65.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton closed the regular-season with an eight-point win over Northern Iowa. That win secured a 15th straight season of 10 or more league wins as well as a 14th straight finish of fourth place or better in Valley play.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s reward for its Senior Day win over Northern Iowa was a rematch with the Panthers six days later. Creighton topped the Panthers, 60-57 in St. Louis, after UNI star Kwadzo Ahelegbe missed a last-second three-pointer that could have sent the contest to overtime.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s tournament title quest ended in the semifinal round against top-seeded Missouri State, 60-50. The Jays led 30-25 at the half before a stifling MSU defense controlled the second stanza.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton accepted a bid to the College Basketball Invitational, a 16-team tournament in its fourth year of existence.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton fell behind 16-7 in the opening minutes of its first-round game vs. San Jose State, but&nbsp; eventually came back to post an 85-74 win over the Spartans. The second round was an offensive display for the ages, with the Jays eliminating Davidson, 102-92 in the highest-scoring game in CBI history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Davidson win pushed Creighton into the semifinals, where it took on UCF. The Knights, which faced major travel issues and arrived just four hours prior to tip-off, were lethargic from the get-go and Creighton cruised to an 82-64 win to reach the unique best-of-3 championship series format.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s opponent in the finals was Oregon, coached by Altman. A CBI record crowd of 12,381 turned out to see Creighton claim an 84-76 win over the Ducks and put CU just one win away from a postseason title.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The series shifted to Eugene for the second game, where Oregon dominated in a 71-58 contest that tied the series at 1-1. \u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third game, also played in Eugene, was everything a title game should be. The teams exchanged 14 leads and 10 ties, and the score was tied in the final 25 seconds.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the shot clock off, Creighton intended to hold the ball for a final shot. But not long after an inbounds pass to Young, the junior point guard would step back over a nearly-invisible half-court line that gave Oregon the ball back with 17.2 seconds left. E.J. Singler would make the game-winning hoop with 2.0 seconds left, giving the Ducks the title in yet another excruciating road defeat for Creighton.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton finished the season 23-16 overall, including a school-record four postseason victories. \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E led the Jays with averages of 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. In addition to his all-MVC first-team accolades, McDermott also swept the Valley Freshman and Newcomer of the Year Awards and became the top-scoring freshman in league history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young was a second-team all-MVC pick and averaged 13.1 points and league-high 5.0 assists per game while also winning his second straight MVC assist\u002Fturnover ratio title.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite missing the first nine games of the season, Echenique still wound up leading the MVC in both blocked shots (55) and field goal percentage (.609). He was named to the MVC\'s All-Defensive Team and All-Newcomer Team at season\'s end.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining McDermott on the Valley\'s All-Freshman Team was guard \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=579\\"\u003EJahenns Manigat\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who averaged 5.4 points per game and provided a constant lift with his energy.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five seniors (Lawson, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=577\\"\u003EKaleb Korver\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=581\\"\u003EWayne Runnels\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=570\\"\u003EDarryl Ashford\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=575\\"\u003ECasey Harriman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) helped ease the transition to the new coaching staff and combined for 20.9 points and 14.3 rebounds per game.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead to 2011-12, Creighton will return five of its top six scorers, and also its rebound, assist, steal and block shot leaders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERadio Broadcast Information\u003Cbr\u003EKXSP (&ldquo;AM 590 - Omaha\'s ESPN Radio&rdquo;) broadcasted all Creighton men\'s basketball games during the 2010-11 season.

2010-11 season will be remembered as a year of near-misses in coach \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Fcoaches.aspx?rc=91\\"\u003EGreg McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\'s first year on the Creighton sideline, but also one in which the fan base was rejuvenated by an influx of players and coaches who helped continue one of the most successful runs in MVC history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDermott won 23 games, most ever by a first-year coach at Creighton, but six losses by three points or less left one to wonder what could have been had the ball bounced the Jays way on a few more occasions.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a four-year run at Iowa State, McDermott was hired in April of 2010 with the tough task of replacing \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Fcoaches.aspx?rc=3\\"\u003EDana Altman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who accepted a similar job at Oregon. Little did both men know that their paths would cross again to end the first season on the job for both.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his hiring, McDermott announced that his son, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, had been released from his signed letter-of-intent at Northern Iowa and would be coming to Creighton. The proclamation received only modest attention at the time, but when all was said and done \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E had one of the best debut seasons in Missouri Valley Conference history as he became the first freshman in 59 years to earn first-team all-Valley honors.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton opened the year with a three-game homestand, including two games in the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge. Creighton dispatched Alabama State in coach McDermott\'s regular-season debut on the Bluejay bench on Nov. 12th, scored the final four points to beat Northern Arizona on Nov. 14th, and topped Louisiana on Nov. 17th, to start 3-0.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led Creighton into a Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge title tilt vs. coach McDermott\'s former school, Iowa State, in Des Moines. Both teams scored at will, shooting more than 50 percent from the field and three-point arc, while owning less than 10 turnovers each. Creighton trailed by five in the final 20 seconds, but tied it with 1.6 seconds left on two free throws by \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=585\\"\u003EAntoine Young\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. ISU big man Jamie Vanderbeken would then catch the inbounds pass, take two dribbles and drain a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cyclones the win. Officials called the shot good, and without a courtside television monitor to confirm, left the court to end the game. It wasn\'t until minutes later that photographs surfaced that showed the shot should not have counted since time expired with the ball still in Vanderbeken\'s hand.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a win over Kennesaw State, Creighton suffered its only three-game losing streak of the season. Creighton lost at Northwestern before dropping a home game against No. 21 BYU despite holding eventual National Player of the Year Jimmer Fredette to a season-low 13 points. Creighton\'s losing streak was extended when Nebraska overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to topple the Jays, 59-54, in Lincoln. Creighton\'s \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=578\\"\u003EKenny Lawson Jr.\u003C\u002Fa\u003E had a three-point shot to tie it in the final 10 seconds that was off the mark, and Nebraska scored the final points on a lay-up in the last second after the Jays crashed the boards with all five men.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton answered the three-game losing streak with a season-best six-game winning streak. Lawson\'s monster game of 30 points and 18 rebounds helped lead the Jays to a 82-75 win over Saint Joseph\'s, which also included 22 points off the bench from a red-hot \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=584\\"\u003EEthan Wragge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The December 18th win over Idaho State featured the highly-anticipated debut of sophomore center \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=572\\"\u003EGregory Echenique\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. A transfer from Rutgers, Echenique had 12 points, five rebounds and three blocked shots after becoming eligible the day after the first semester ended on the Creighton campus. Creighton then beat Western Illinois and Samford to enter Missouri Valley Conference play with an 8-4 mark.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton entered league play on the road with a 64-53 win at Illinois State before returning home to post a 16-point triumph over Drake. Creighton then dropped a rare home game with a 67-55 loss to Missouri State, the eventual regular-season champ in the MVC.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jays then took the road to pick up an overtime win at Southern Illinois, followed by a five-point win at Evansville, to stand at 4-1 in league play. CU dropped to 4-2 in league play with a home loss to Wichita State on Jan. 12th, the Shockers first win in Omaha since 1992.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton went on the road at Indiana State on Jan. 16th and suffered a loss at the buzzer. With the score tied and time winding down, Creighton forced a contested airball by Jake Odum as time wound down, only to have Carl Richard follow Odum\'s miss with an over-the-shoulder tip-in that beat the buzzer, and the Jays, 61-59.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home to beat Bradley before another heart-breaking road loss. The Jays led Missouri State nearly wire-to-wire, only to miss some late free throws and allow a game-deciding lay-up to league Player of the Year Kyle Weems with 14.2 seconds left. Creighton would turn the ball over on its ensuing possession, losing 67-66 in an intense JQH Arena environment.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four days after the MSU loss, Creighton went to the old stomping ground of coach McDermott, and the school that his son Doug had signed with, Northern Iowa. A nationally-televised audience saw Creighton hang with UNI, but lost to the hot-shooting Panthers by five in another tight road setback.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton returned home on Jan. 29 to avenge its road loss to Indiana State, only to sputter away from home with a loss to a last-place Bradley team. Just hours before the scheduled 7 pm tipoff, the start time was moved up to 3 pm due to a blizzard that shut down the city of Peoria. Fewer than 800 fans were in the facility by tip-off for the rare Tuesday afternoon start.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again Creighton responded from a tough road loss with a home win, this time beating Evansville. However, the road frustrations continued, as Drake edged Creighton 67-64 when Young\'s game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton came back home to beat Southern Illinois and Illinois State, only to lose at Akron in a non-televised BracketBusters game. Creighton returned to league play with a game at Wichita State. With the score tied late, WSU\'s Aaron Ellis hit a lay-up with 1.5 seconds left to hand CU another frustrating road loss, 67-65.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton closed the regular-season with an eight-point win over Northern Iowa. That win secured a 15th straight season of 10 or more league wins as well as a 14th straight finish of fourth place or better in Valley play.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s reward for its Senior Day win over Northern Iowa was a rematch with the Panthers six days later. Creighton topped the Panthers, 60-57 in St. Louis, after UNI star Kwadzo Ahelegbe missed a last-second three-pointer that could have sent the contest to overtime.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s tournament title quest ended in the semifinal round against top-seeded Missouri State, 60-50. The Jays led 30-25 at the half before a stifling MSU defense controlled the second stanza.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton accepted a bid to the College Basketball Invitational, a 16-team tournament in its fourth year of existence.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton fell behind 16-7 in the opening minutes of its first-round game vs. San Jose State, but&nbsp; eventually came back to post an 85-74 win over the Spartans. The second round was an offensive display for the ages, with the Jays eliminating Davidson, 102-92 in the highest-scoring game in CBI history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Davidson win pushed Creighton into the semifinals, where it took on UCF. The Knights, which faced major travel issues and arrived just four hours prior to tip-off, were lethargic from the get-go and Creighton cruised to an 82-64 win to reach the unique best-of-3 championship series format.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton\'s opponent in the finals was Oregon, coached by Altman. A CBI record crowd of 12,381 turned out to see Creighton claim an 84-76 win over the Ducks and put CU just one win away from a postseason title.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The series shifted to Eugene for the second game, where Oregon dominated in a 71-58 contest that tied the series at 1-1. \u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third game, also played in Eugene, was everything a title game should be. The teams exchanged 14 leads and 10 ties, and the score was tied in the final 25 seconds.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the shot clock off, Creighton intended to hold the ball for a final shot. But not long after an inbounds pass to Young, the junior point guard would step back over a nearly-invisible half-court line that gave Oregon the ball back with 17.2 seconds left. E.J. Singler would make the game-winning hoop with 2.0 seconds left, giving the Ducks the title in yet another excruciating road defeat for Creighton.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creighton finished the season 23-16 overall, including a school-record four postseason victories. \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=580\\"\u003EDoug McDermott\u003C\u002Fa\u003E led the Jays with averages of 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. In addition to his all-MVC first-team accolades, McDermott also swept the Valley Freshman and Newcomer of the Year Awards and became the top-scoring freshman in league history.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young was a second-team all-MVC pick and averaged 13.1 points and league-high 5.0 assists per game while also winning his second straight MVC assist\u002Fturnover ratio title.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite missing the first nine games of the season, Echenique still wound up leading the MVC in both blocked shots (55) and field goal percentage (.609). He was named to the MVC\'s All-Defensive Team and All-Newcomer Team at season\'s end.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joining McDermott on the Valley\'s All-Freshman Team was guard \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=579\\"\u003EJahenns Manigat\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who averaged 5.4 points per game and provided a constant lift with his energy.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five seniors (Lawson, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=577\\"\u003EKaleb Korver\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=581\\"\u003EWayne Runnels\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=570\\"\u003EDarryl Ashford\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca class=\\"biolink\\" href=\\"\u002Froster.aspx?rp_id=575\\"\u003ECasey Harriman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) helped ease the transition to the new coaching staff and combined for 20.9 points and 14.3 rebounds per game.\u003Cbr\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead to 2011-12, Creighton will return five of its top six scorers, and also its rebound, assist, steal and block shot leaders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERadio Broadcast Information\u003Cbr\u003EKXSP (&ldquo;AM 590 - Omaha\'s ESPN Radio&rdquo;) broadcasted all Creighton men\'s basketball games during the 2010-11 season.
