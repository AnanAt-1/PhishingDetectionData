In the first match, on the island of Guam, Budge trounced Riggs 6â€“2 6â€“2. On the island of Peleliu Budge won again 6â€“4 7â€“5. Riggs won the next two matches against Budge 6â€“1 6â€“1 (island of Ulithi) and 6â€“3, 4â€“6, 6â€“1 (island of Saipan). Budge confided in Parker his disbelief at losing two matches in a row to Riggs. In the fifth and final match on the island of Tinian, scheduled for the first week of August 1945, Riggs defeated Budge 6â€“8 6â€“1 8â€“6. This was the first time Budge had been beaten by Riggs in a series (Riggs also won 3 matches out of 5 against the amateur Parker, both holder and future titlist of the U.S. amateur Nationals at Forest Hills) thereby giving Riggs an important psychological edge in their forthcoming peacetime tours.<br />

Next year Riggs stayed the pro king by defeating again Budge in the U.S. Pro final in five sets. Riggs then established himself as the World No. 1&nbsp;for those two years. According to Kramer,<br />
According to Riggs, however, Budge still had a very powerful, very deadly overhead and that rather than winning outright very many points with his lobbing, he actually achieved two other goals: his constant lobbing led Budge to play somewhat deeper at the net than he would have otherwise, thereby making it easier for Riggs to hit passing shots for winners; and the constant lobbing helped to wear Budge down by forcing him to run back to the backline time after time. Budge reached two more U.S. Pro finals, losing in 1949 at Forest Hills to Riggs and in 1953 in Cleveland to Pancho Gonzales.<br />

<H2>Assessment</H2>
Budge is a consensus pick for being one of the greatest players of all time.  He had a graceful, overpowering backhand that he hit with a slight amount of topspin and that, combined with his quickness and his serve, made him the best player of his time. E. Digby Baltzell wrote in 1994 that Budge and Laver "have usually been rated at the top of any all-time World Champions list, Budge having a slight edge."  Will Grimsley wrote in 1971 that Budge "is considered by many to be foremost among the all-time greats."  Paul Metzler, in his analysis of ten of the all-time greats, singles out Budge as the greatest player before World War II, and gives him second place overall behind <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("85753",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("85753")' href="/topics/Jack_Kramer_(tennis_player)">Jack Kramer</a><span class="hp" id="m85753"><div class="hpHeader">Jack Kramer (tennis player)</div><div class="hpContent">John Albert Kramer  was an American tennis player of the 1940s.
