<h3>Automatic Key retrieval in procmail</h3>

This is some <a
href="http://www.iki.fi/~era/procmail/links.html">procmail</a>
code and a shell script to collect pgp keys that are used to sign or
encrypt mail that you recieve.<P>

Right now, it only collects keys that are on the key servers, although
it would be easy to look for finger near pgp, and extract keys there.
I haven't written that code because I think that finger for pgp key is
philisophically wrong.  Anyone (behind firewalls, over UUCP links) can
use this code just as well as someone on a T3.<P>

I've been thinking of adding an http mode that uses netcat to grab
keys, but its a lot of complexity, and since I'm sorting mail into
boxes anyway, I've found that the email retreival is fast enough to
get keys before I get to see most messages.<P>

<h4>The code</h4>

This rule set exists becuase I often made mistakes, and got sent the
whole damn ring.  Also, I don't need to see failures, except by
looking at my procmail log files.  The key handling is before the key
retreival to avoid loops when a key comes in.<P>

This line could replace the elm line above, but I haven't tested it.
nc is netcat.  Ask your vendor why its not included, and get it
yourself.  <a href="ftp://ftp.avian.org/src/hacks/">FTP netcat</a>

<hr>
This next bit is the sender unknown script.  Its longer than it
	strictly needs to be for readability.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# sender_unknown returns a keyid, exits 1 if the key is known
# $output is to get the exit status. Othierwise, this would be a one
liner.
OUTPUT=`pgp -f +VERBOSE=0 +batchmode  -o /dev/null`
echo $OUTPUT | egrep -s 'not found in file'
EV=$? 
if [ $EV -eq 0 ]; then 
        echo $OUTPUT | awk '{print $6}' 
fi
exit $EV
</pre>
