PREFACE  TO    FOURTH   EDITION. 


The  first  edition  of  this  work  was  issued  in  1881,  consisting  of  12,000  copies,  and 
was  exhausted  early  in  1882. 

They  were  distributed  upon  application  into  every  State  and  Canada.  Soon  after 
an  edition  of  5,000  copies  was  printed  in  the  German  language,  also  a  similar  edition 
in  the  Dutch  language  for  Hollanders.  Three  thousand  were  issued  in  February  fol- 
lowing and  the  same  number  in  April. 

A  little  more  than  three  months  after  the  first  edition  was  published  a  second 
edition  of  20,000,  enlarged  and  thoroughly  revised,  was  issued.  Much  more  valuable 
information  was  furnished  in  the  second  edition  relative  to  finances,  leading  insti- 
tutions and  industries  of  the  State,  together  with  facts  derived  from  the  statistics 
of  1880,  railroad  development,  etc.  It  was  found  later  that  this  supply  was  insuffi- 
cient and  10,000  addi  tional  copies  were  issued,  making  a  total  of  42,000  in  the  English 
language.     Ten  thousand  more  were  ordered  in  February,  which  were  soon  exhausted. 

The  third  edition  was  issued  in  1883,  giving  a  sketch  of  each  county  and  general 
information  about  the  State.  This,  too,  was  exhausted  before  1885,  and  still  applica- 
tions were  made  for  the  book.  The  Legislature  of  1891  authorized  the  reissue  of 
the  work,  but  the  Governor  failed  to  sign  the  act. 

In  1893  the  Legislature  authorized  its  recompilation  and  the  reissue  of  12,000  vol- 
umes, 8,000  copies  of  which  were  to  go  to  the  World's  Fair,  at  Chicago,  for 
distribution. 

The  small  appropriation  and  short  time  allowed  to  perform  the  work  may  largely 
interfere  with  its  completeness,  but  such  as  it  is  we  present  it.  There  may  be 
many  errrors  in  it,  that  is  the  human  part  of  it.  To  overlook  errors  would  be  the 
humane  part,  but  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  "Resources  of  Michigan"  would 
cause  you,  in  the  honesty  of  your  conviction,  to  exclaim,  "  The  half  was  never 
told!"

ADMISSION   INTO  THE  UNION. 


A  census  of  Michigan  in  1834  showed  a  population  87,273,  more  than  enough  to 
entitle  the  territory  to  statehood. 

In  1835  the  legislative  council  authorized  a  convention  to  form  a  State  constitution, 
which  was  done  in  May  and  adopted  by  the  people.  At  the  same  election  State  officers 
were  chosen. 

The  legislature  met  in  the  November  following,  and  Stevens  T.  Mason,  "  the  boy 
Govenor,"  entered  upon  the  duties  of  his  office. 

At  the  same  time  John  S.  Horner  claimed  to  be  the  Governor  by  virtue  of  an 
appointment  by  President  Jackson.  The  history  of  the  contest  to  settle  this  question 
forms  a  particularly  interesting  part  of  the  history  of  Michigan,  which  want  of  space 
compels  us  to  omit.  It  was  at  this  time  the  historical  "  Toledo  war  "  made  an  epoch 
of  Michigan  more  ludicrous  than  serious. 

Michigan  claimed  the  boundary  line  established  by  the  ordinance  of  1787  must 
obtain.  By  this  a  considerable  strip  would  be  taken  from  northern  Ohio,  and  even 
Toledo  would  be  placed  in  Michigan  Ohio  claimed  the  said  ordinance  had  been  set 
aside  by  the  constitution. 

Ohio  was  in  possession.  Michigan  laid  claim  to  the  strip.  Stevens  T.  Mason,  with 
probably  more  spirit  than  mature  judgment,  determined  at  whatever  cost  to  repos- 
sess the  coveted  strip,  and  Gov.  Lucus,  of  Ohio,  was  equally  deterrnined  to  hold  it. 

In  the  spring  of  18.36  Gov.  Mason  called  the  State  troops,  formed  an  army  of 
about  1,000  men,  and  marched  to  the  scene  of  conflict.  From  the  general  history  of 
the  matter  it  was  considered  more  boys'  play  than  anything  else  by  the  authorities 
at  Washington.  No  battle  was  fought,  in  fact  it  never  assumed  a  very  hostile  or 
warlike  appearance. 

There  was  probably  no  intention  on  either  side  to  spill  either  Wolverine  or 
Buckeye  blood.  Not  but  the  men  on  both  sides  of  the  conflict  were  brave  and 
determined,  but  the  whole  affair  wore  the  appearance  of  a  snowball  battle,  and 
trickery  took  the  place  of  military  tactics.  It  has  been  said  that  there  was  an 
understanding  among  the  troops  on  each  side  that  blank  cartridges  only  were  to  be 
used. 

In  order  to  conciliate  both  sides  the  general  government  made  a  proposition 
that  Ohio  should  retain  possession  of  the  strip,  and  Michigan  should  have  the 
entire  upper  peninsula.  This  was  rejected  by  Michigan.  A  small  strip  of  farm 
land    and  the  village    of   Vistula   or   Toledo   was   considered  worth   more   than    the

whole  upper  peninsula.  But  the  State  was  organized  and  could  be  admitted  to  the 
coveted  dignity  of  a  real  State  by  accepting  the  terms— washing  off  the  war  paint, 
and  exchanging  the  implements  of  warfare  for  a  state  seal.  Consequently  on  the 
15th  day  of  December,  1836,  assented  to  the  conditions,  and  on  the  27th  day  of 
January,  18.37,  Michigan  became  a  member  of  the  great  family. 

There  being  no  more  serious  results  from  the  Toledo  war  than  mere  disappoint- 
ment among  a  few  ambitious  persons,  the  whole  matter  has  been  looked  upon  as  a 
joke. 

There  was  no  sectional  hatred  or  animosities  resulting  from  the  Toledo  war.  It 
is  likely  the  ambition  of  a  few  may  have  been  chilled,  but  the  whole  matter  has 
been  looked  upon  as  a  joke,  and  now,  when  the  great  wealth  of  the  upper  penin- 
sula is  considered,  the  joke  becomes  richer.  As  stated,  Michigan  became  a  State 
in  1837  and  took  rank  in  population  as  23d,  having  a  population  of  174,467.  In  1890 
it  stood  9th,  with  a  population  of  2,093,889. 

GEOGRAPHICAL. 

In  latitude  it  is  the  same  as  the  State  of  New  York  and  is  located  between  42 
and  48°  north  latitude. 

The  most  southern  portion  of  England  is  50°  north.  France  is  located  between 
42  and  50°,  Norway  entirely  north  of  58°,  Sweden  principally  north  of  56°.  Marquette 
in  Michigan  is  more  than  two  degrees  farther  south  than  the  city  of  Paris  in 
France.  Copper  Harbor,  in  Keweenaw  county,  the  most  northern  village  of  Mich- 
igan, is  about  the  same  latitude  as  the  central  part  of  France.  The  southern  line 
of  Michigan  is  in  the  same  latitude  as  Rome  in  Italy  and  the  northern  line  of 
Portugal,  Oregon,  Wisconsin,  New  York,  Vermont,  New  Hampshire,  Massachusetts 
and  Maine  are  in  the  same  latitude.  The  State  is  nearly  surrounded  by  the  grand- 
est fresh  water  lakes  in  the  world.  On  the  north  Lake  Superior,  the  largest 
lake  in  the  world,  the  navigation  of  which  passes  through  one  of  the  finest  lock 
canals  in  the  world,  located  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie  ( "  the  Soo" ).  Lake  Michigan, 
"  the  great  unsalted  sea,"  next  in  size,  is  the  grandest  and  most  beautiful  body 
of  fresh  water  in  the  world.  Lakes  Huron,  St.  Clair  and  Erie  on  the  east  are 
grand  bodies  of  water.  Michigan  has  a  coast  line  of  more  than  1,600  miles. 
Vessels  carrying  1,000,000  feet  of  lumber  may  be  seen  in  her  waters.  It  has  7,410 
miles  of  railroad.  There  are  84  organized  counties  (not  including  Isle  Royal),  most 
of  which  have  well  built  court  houses.  In  the  front  line  of  products  in  the  United 
States  we  find  Michigan  points  to  copper,  lumber  and  salt,  and  in  close  proximity 
to  the  front,  wheat,  iron,  fruit,  potatoes,  cefery,  etc.  In  manufactories,  Michigan 
furniture,  cars,  carriages,  engines,  pianos,  and  in  fact  nearly  all  productions  of  soil, 
skill  and  labor  are  well  up  in  the  scale  of  excellence.

For  many  years  Michigan  was  handicapped  by  the  impression  becoming  general 
that  there  was  nothing  in  the  State  to  induce  settlers.  In  the  early  settlement 
of  the  State  a  commission  was  appointed  to  investigate  and  make  report  relative  to  the 
condition  of  the  land,  its  value,  etc.  Their  visit  occurred  at  a  time  when  the  State, 
almost  a  wilderness,  was  very  wet,  and  it  is  supposed  they  became  disgusted.  They 
reported  that  the  State  was  a  vast  swamp.    It  was  called  the  Great  Black  Swamp,  the 


Admission  into  the  Union. 


principal  products  being  frogs  and  ague,  and  what  timber  there  was  on  the  land  was 
entirely  inaccessible.  This,  coming  from  the  source  it  did,  created  a  very  unfavorable 
impi'ession  of  Michigan  and  the  tide  of  immigration  was  turned  toward  other  States. 
This  impression  was  strengthened  by  a  letter  written  by  a  deputy  United  States  sur- 
veyor when  surveying  Oakland  county.  It  was  probably  very  wet  weather.  The  writer 
said  in  substance  that  the  land  was  springy  and  indicated  a  submarine  lake  underly- 
ing the  surface,  rendering  it  very  unsafe  for  horses  or  men,  and  finished  his  letter 
by  saying  that  the  balance  of  the  State  was  a  vast  swamp,  and  inasmuch  as 
this  was  about  as  far  west  as  civilization  was  ever  likely  to  extend,  it  would 
be  useless  expenditure  of  time  and  money  to  proceed  any  further  with  the  survey. 

Had  a  true  representation  of  the  vast  resources  of  the  State  been  made  at  the 
time  instead  of  the  erroneous  impression  that  was  not  even  worthy  of  investigation,, 
the  State  today  would  occupy  even  a  more  exalted  position  in  the  galaxy  of  States. 

The  writer  remembers  an  incident  showing  the  impression  of  Michigan  in  Ohio. 
When  the  Illinois  and  Iowa  fever  struck  Ohio  thousands  were  going  to  the  west 
to  invest.  A  gentleman  from  Michigan  visited  my  father's  house  in  Ohio,  and 
learing  that  the  western  fever  had  struck  my  father,  asked  him  why  not  go  to 
Michigan.  "Michigan?  Go  to  Michigan  to  shake  with  ague  and  starve  to  death, 
the  frogs  piping  a  requiem  at  my  funeral?  Why  there  is  hardly  an  acre  of  farm- 
ing land  in  the  State.  This  we  know,  for  we  have  it  straight  from  the  public 
statements.  What  do  not  starve  or  die  with  malarious  diseases,  will  freeze  to 
death."  Such  was  believed  of  Michigan.  School  children  were  told  of  the  "  Great 
Desert  of  the  west,  and  the  Great  Black  Swamp  of  Michigan."  Early  geographers 
were  at  fault  and  the  more  pious  wondered  why  the  Creator  had  made  such  places  as 
the  Great  Desert  and  Michigan. 

Illinois.  Iowa,  Indiana,  Kansas,  Minnesota,  and  other  States  were  benefited  by 
these  false  statements  and  impressions.  Thousands  of  enterprising  persons  from 
overcrowded   eastern   states   went   west. 

Many  who  had  never  seen  prairies  were  enchanted,  nothing  to  do  but  begin 
farming.  When  crops  wei-e  gathered  the  question  arose,  what  will  we  do  with 
them.  When  winter  came  the  question  of  fuel  became  urgent.  'Tis  true  the 
Creator  had  spread  out  a  beautiful  panorama  of  his  handiwork,  but  the  great 
beauty  of  land  was  at  the  expense  of  timber  for  lumber  to  build  and  fuel  to  burn. 
The  greatest  school  to  teach  appreciation  of  blessings  is  deprivation.  Obstacles  to 
perfect  enjoyment  are  often  rich  blessings.  The  great  unbroken  forests  of  Michi- 
gan, '•  that  dreadful  country,"  was  intended  to  supply  the  lumber  for  homes  and 
comforts  throughout  the  prairie  and  timberless  regions  of  the  west.  It  was  also  a 
storehouse  with  unlimited  supply  of  iron,  copper  and  salt.  Millions  of  people 
today  enjoy  the  comforts  of  houses  built  of  Michigan  lumber.  Stop  and  consider  a 
moment.  The  State  furnished  say  4,000.000.000  feet  of  lumber  per  year;  allow  20,000 
feet  to  each  house,  this  would  be  sufficient  to  build  200,000  houses  for  families  of 
five  each,  1,000.000  persons,  and  although  this  great  drain  on  the  timber  supply 
has  been  going  on  for  a  quarter  of  a  century  or  more,  sufficient  pine  is  left  to 
supply  the  needs  of  the  State,  and  it  is  safe  to  say  that  enough  timber  has  been 
burned  and  otherwise  destroyed  to  supply  a  good  sized  state  with  buildings. 

The  State  is  practically  out  of  debt  and  can  not  get  into  debt  very  deeply,  or 
more  than  850.000.  The  public  buildings,  complete  and  elegant,  are  all  paid  for,

consisting  of  capitol,  two  penitentiaries,  four  asylums  for  the  insane,  one  school, 
for  the  blind,  and  one  asylum  for  the  deaf  and  dumb,  one  of  the  largest  univer- 
sities in  the  world,  the  finest  agricultural  college  in  the  United  States,  reformatory, 
industrial  school  for  boys,  same  for  girls,  mining  school,  soldiers'  home,  and  in  fact 
about  everything  that  could  be  called  improvements.  Michigan  began  where 
other  older  states  stopped.  She  has  not  stopped  and  has  seldom  even  called  a  halt 
in  her  steady  march  to  the  front  ranks  of  civilization. 


THE  STATE  CAPITOL. 


The  seat  of  government  of  the  State  was  located  at  Lansing  in  1847. 

The  old  capitol  was  built  and  archives  of  the  State  removed.  There  was  no  city 
here,  not  even  a  village.  It  was  almost  an  unbroken  wilderness.  To  illustrate  the 
wild  condition  of  the  land  at  that  time  an  incident  may  be  mentioned. 

Arrangements  were  made  to  perform  a  wedding  ceremony  in  the  Governor's  room. 
Guests  were  invited,  among  whom  were  a  couple  of  ladies  living  near  the  present 
location  of  the  Everett  house,  about  five  or  six  blocks  from  the  capitol.  Toward 
evening  they  left  home  to  attend  the  wedding,  lost  their  way.  Pandered  around  the 
country  through  the  forest  and  thickets  until  dark  and  being  unable  to  find  the 
capiti)!  took  the  back  track,  or  in  some  way  found  home.  They  gave  it  up,  disgusted 
with  "city  life,"  but  glad  they  had  escaped  contact  with  bears  and  wolves. 

Nearly  opposite  the  capitol,  or  across  the  road,  now  Washington  Ave.,  near  the 
present  location  of  the  Hudson  house,  there  stood  a  monster  walnut  tree.  During 
a  storm  it  fell  across  the  road,  completely  blocking  the  road  (probably  the  only 
road).  It  became  necessary  to  get  it  out  of  the  way.  It  was  cut  into  logs,  piled 
up  and  burned  in  a  great  log  heap,  no  value  being  placed  on  the  lumber  it  would 
have  made. 

The  new  capitol  was  begun  in  1872.  An  appropriation  of  $1,430,000  was  made, 
$1,427,743.78  expended  and  $2,256.22  turned  back  into  the  treasury.  An  act  standing 
today  as  a  living  monument  to  the  honesty  of  the  building  committee.  An  act  having 
few  if  any  parallels  in  the  history  of  the  country. 

The  building  is  345x191.5  feet,  or  including  porticoes  and  steps  420x274  feet- 
Extreme  height,  267  feet.  Covers  one  and  one-sixth  acres  and  has  a  walk  around 
outside  wall  of  1,520  feet. 

The  superstructure  is  built  of  Amherst,  Ohio,  sandstone;  15,000,000  Lansing  brick 
were  used.  English  plate  glass  of  best  quality,  in  fact  all  materials  were  of  the  best. 
And  although  fifteen  years  have  passed  since  it  was  built  not  a  flaw  is  found  in 
the  work  or  design  except,  perhaps,  the  poor  accoustic  properties  of  the  hall  of 
representatives. 

The  two  legislative  halls  are  illuminated  by  electric  lights.  Through  the  building 
there  are  271  chandeliers,  1,702  gas  burners,  one  elevator,  and  about  20  elegant 
stairways.  It  is  heated  by  steam  throughout.  The  plumbing  system  is  perfect. 
There  is  not  the  remotest  danger  from  fire,  wind  or  water. 

In  short  it  is  the  most  elegant  and  complete  capitol  in  the  United  States  built 
for  anything  near  the  same  amount  of  money.

I  HE  STATE —GROWTH,  POPULATION  AND  WEALTH. 


ITS    VALUE   DISCOVERED. 

It  is  only  within  a  very  few  years  that  the  northern  counties  of  the  lower 
peninsula  have  been  known  and  understood,  except  by  a  few  enterprising  men, 
even  among  Michigan  people.  The  extension  of  the  lumber  interests,  seeking 
fresh  material  for  the  mills,  led  to  their  tirst  thorough  exploration,  and  it  was 
not  until  those  interests  had  acquired  enormous  magnitude  that  the  now  undoubted 
fact  was  realized  that,  great  as  had  been  their  profits,  the  discoveries  they  had 
made  and  the  great  wilderness  they  had  partially  cleared  promised  more  to  agri- 
culture than  it  had  yielded  to  the  ax.  Immense  tracts  of  hardwood  timber 
were  found  containing  no  pine,  and  it  was  found,  too.  that  large  portions  of  our 
northern  territory  which  produce  the  best  pine  produce  also  the  best  crops. 
There  are  pine  barrens  bearing  an  inferior  and  scraggy  wood,  which  the  fas- 
tidious lumberman  utterly  neglects.  But  these  occupy  only  limited  areas  in  what 
are  known  as  the  pine  regions  of  the  State,  and  cover  only  a  comparatively 
small  portion  of  its  territory.  Most  of  the  great  trees  which  constitute  the 
pride  of  our  lumber  forests,  and  have  made  Michigan  pine  famovis  at  home  and 
abroad,  grow  largely  among  beeches  and  hard  maple  and  other  valuable  wood, 
which  only  flourish  on  soils  capable  of  yielding  good  crops.  A  few  of  these 
noble  pines,  standing  among  scores  of  hard  timber,  give  character  to  the  dis- 
coveries of  the  "  land  looker "  for  the  saw-mills,  while  in  no  wise  detracting  from 
the  value  of  the  soil  on  which  they  grow.  Of  course  there  are  different  degrees 
of  value  in  these  lands,  as  in  all  others,  and  the  settler  will  6xercise  the  same 
discretion  in  his  choice  as  he  does  in  determining  other  accessories  to  a  home. 
But  there  are  thousands  of  acres  in  Michigan  from  which  pine  trees  have  been 
cut,  as  well  as  many  other  thousands  which  have  never  borne  pine,  into  the  soil 
of  which  no  ploughshare  has  ever  penetrated,  which  will  well  repay  the  labors 
of  the  husbandman,  and  the  fee  simple  of  which  can  be  bought  for  less  than 
a  year's  rental   of   many   of   the  lands  of  Europe. 

AN    UNSTIMULATED     GROWTH. 

No    organized   effort    has    been   made    by    the  State    to  promote  general   immi« 
gration.     Whatever   means  have   been   employed   to   invite   population   from  abroad

Michigan  and  its  Resources. 


have  been  isolated  and  fragmentary.  The  growth  of  the  State  has  been  entirely- 
natural  and  unstimulated.  The  result  has  been  to  make  its  people  peculiarly 
homogeneous  in  character.  New  elements  have  been  assimilated  with  marked 
success  and  rapidity.  The  natural  resources  and  attractions  of  the  State,  how- 
ever, have  continued  to  draw  people  hitherward  from  other  States  and  from 
Europe,  until  the  population  of  57  years  ago  has  increased  nearly  ten-fold.  The 
territory  which  entered  the  Union  in  1837,  with  174,467  inhabitants  of  both  sexes- 
and  all  ages,  sent  to  its  defense  less  than  thirty  years  later  more  than  90,000 
soldiers.  The  State  which  stood  twenty-third  in  rank  in  1840  had  advanced  to 
the  9th  in  1890.  A  table  based  upon  the  returns  of  the  United  States  census 
in  each  succeeding  decade   tells  the   whole  story:

UPPER     PENINSULA. 


BY  GEO.  A.  ROYCE. 


On  the  first  day  of  July,  1892,  we  prepared  a  list  of  the  vacant  government  lande^ 
for  the  annual  report  of  the  honorable  Commissioner  of  General  Land  Office,  show- 
ing that  there  were  523,411  acres  of  vacant  government  land  in  this  disti-ict,  divided 
among  the  several  counties  as  follows: 


Conntiee.  Acres. 

Alger 12,118

We  do  not  know  the  character  of  these  lands  except  in  a  general  way.  and  are 
therefore  unable  to  give  definite  information  concerning  any  particular  tract.  There 
is  a  great  deal  of  timber  land  in  this  district,  pine,  hemlock,  birch,  maple  and 
poplar,  predominating.  Considerable  farming  is  done  in  this  peninsula  and  we  have 
the  reputation  of  growing  the  finest  root  crops  in  the  State.  Small  fruits  are  also 
a  certain  crop.  Wheat,  oats,  rye  and  barley  are  successfully  raised  and  hay  is  gen- 
erally an  abundant  crop.  I  do  not  know  that  stock  raising  has  been  followed  to 
any  extent  in  this  country  and  it  occurs  to  me  that  our  geographical  position  would 
render  such  an  enterprise  unprofitable,  owing  to  our  long  and  severe  winters.  It  is 
a  well  known  fact,  however,  that  the  farmer  of  this  locality  is  better  rewarded  for 
hie  labor  than  the  farmer  of  almost  any  other  locality.  Our  remoteness  from  the 
great  markets  of  the  country  make  it  necessary  for  lumbermen  and  others  doing 
business  in  the  country,  to  purchase  our  farm  crops  at  a  much  higher  price  than 
can  be  obtained  for  the  same  sort  of  produce  in   the  more  thickly  settled  districts.

STATE  LANDS  FOR  SALE. 

The  following  is  the  latest  circular  issued  by  Michigan  State  Land  office,  show- 
ing amount  of  land  for  sale  or  entry  on  January  1,  1893,  with  general  instructions 
and  information  relative  thereto: 

[  Circular  No.  1.  ] 

MICHIGAN   8TATE  LAND   OFFICE,  AT  LANSING. 

ALL  LANDS  OWNED  BY  THIS  STATE  ARE  CONTROLLED  BY  THIS  OFFICE.      THERE 

ARE  NO  LOCAL  AGENTS.      BUSINESS  CAN   BE  DONE   BY  LETTER.      IT  IS 

NOT    NECESSARY   TO   COME   HERE. 

This  office  cannot  give  information  about  the  soil  and  timber  of  any  particular 
lots,  bid  buyers  and  settlers  are  advised  to  examine  for  themselves   before  taking. 


Section  1.    To  aid  in  looking  up  State  lands  we  furnish  plats  at  the  legal  prices, 
payable  in  advance,  as  follows: 
Showing  vacant  lands,  25  cents  per  township. 
Same,  with  streams  drawn  on,  50  cents  per  township. 
Showing  vacant  lands,  streams,  and  names  of  purchasers  of  State  lands,  $1.50  per 


United  States  Land  Offices.  21 

township.  In  ordering  plats,  always  give  the  number  of  the  town  and  range  of 
the  townships  wanted. 

A  plat  showing  all  the  vacant  State  lands  in  any  county  will  be  furnished  for 
the  price  named  in  our  land  table  in  section  10  of  this  circular. 

Cash  should  be  sent  with  orders  by  mail. 

~  SWAMP   LANDS. 

Section  2.  Prices  range  from  $1.25  to  §8.00  per  acre,  the  main  body  being  held 
at  $1.25.  Only  a  few  townships  in  the  northern  part  of  the  State  are  held  at  more 
than  $1.25  per   acre. 

Eighty  acres  or  less  of  these  lands,  in  one  body  in  the  lower  peninsula  can  be 
bought  by  any  person  on  a  first  payment  of  one-quarter  of  the  price  down.  The 
buyer  must  make  affidavit  that  he  will  settle  on  the  land  within  one  year  after  the 
pvirchase.  Blank  affidavits  furnished.  Ten  years'  time  allowed  to  pay  the  balance 
at  seven  per  cent  annual  interest.  Swanip  land  scrip  cannot  be  used  in  jjurchase  or 
payment  of  balance  due. 

These  lands  are  subject  to  homestead  entry;  any  citizen  over  21  years  old,  and 
not  already  owning  40  acres  of  land,  may  homestead  not  to  exceed  80  acres,  but  he 
may  buy  an  adjoining  80  acres  or  less  on  quarter  payment  down,  with  ten  years'  time 
on  the  balance,  with  seven  per  cent  annual  interest.  Blank  applications  furnished 
at  this  office. 

In  cases  where  swamp  lands,  are  paid  for  all  down,  payment  will  be  received  in 
money  or  in  swamp   land   scrip,  and   there  is  no  limit  to  the  quantity  purchased. 

The  State  constructs  wagon  roads  and  ditches  in  the  newly  settled  portions  of 
its  territory,  making  payment  for  the  work  in  swamp  lands,  so-called.  Thus  a 
contractor  having  finished  his  road  job  receives  a  swamp  land  credit  at  this  office, 
on  which  he  may  draw  orders  in  favor  of  any  person. 

SCHOOL   LANDS. 

Section  3.    Price  S4.00  per  acre. 

Where  these  lands  are  valuable  for  pine,  cedar  or  hemlock  timber  they  mutt 
be  paid  for  all  down.  But  where  they  are  valuable  mainly  for  farming  purposes 
they  can  be  sold  on  time. 

Persons  desiring  to  buy  on  time  are  i-equired  to  furnish  this  office  with  a  timber 
affidavit,  and  by  this  affidavit  the  commissioner  will  decide  whether  the  desired 
lots  are  subject  to  sale  on  time,  and  if  so  subject  to  sale  on  time,  first  payment  of 
not  less  than  one-half  the  price  down  will  be  received.  Blank  timber  affidavits 
furnished. 

On  the  balance  due  the  time  is  not  limited,  and  seven  per  cent  yearly  interest  is 
charged. 

COLLEGE    LANDS. 

Section  4.  These  lands  have  been  recently  examined  by  competent  men,  and 
appraised  by  the  State  Board  of  Agriculture  at  from  $5.00  to  812.50  per  acre. 
They  may  be  sold  on  not  less  than  one-quarter  payment  down,  if  they  are  not 
mainly  valuable  for  the  timber  thereon. 

Time  on  balance  due  not  limited.  Interest  seven  per  cent.  The  balance  due  or  any 
part  of  it  may  be  paid  at  any  time. 

OTHER    LANDS. 

Section  5.  University  lands  are  held  $12.00  per  acre,  asset  lands  at  $10.00  per 
acre,  asylum  lands,  salt  spring  lands,  and  State  building  lands  at  $4.00  per  aero, 
the  terms  being  the  same  as  for  school  lands. 

FORFEITED    LANDS. 

Section  6.  The  price  of  forfeited  part-paid  lands,  now  held  by  the  State,  is  the 
original  minimum  price  per  acre,  and  all  improvements  and  unpaid  taxes  added 
thereto. 


■22  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 


APPLICATIONS. 

Section  7.  No  lands  can  be  withheld  from  market  for  the  benefit  of  purchasers 
until  the  purchase  price  is  received  at  this  office,  and  all  deposits  to  ptirchase  on  part 
payment  must  be  accompanied  with  an  acceptable  affidavit  as  required  by  law. 

When  full  payment  down  is  made,  no  particular  form  of  application  is  required 
but  the  applicant  should  be  particular  and  give  full  name  and  address  of  person 
to  whom  patent  is  to  issue. 

Sec.  8.  For  information  as  to  government  or  railroad  land  apply  to  United 
States  land  office  at  Marquette,  upper  peninsula,  and  Grayling,  lower  peninsula, 
as  this  office  has  no  record  of  such  lands  entered  or  unentered.

MICHIGAN   SOILS. 


BY   R.  C.  KEDZIE,  AGRICULTURAL   COLLEGE. 


No  State  has  suffered  more  in  reputation  by  reason  of  ignorant  misrepresen- 
tation than  Michigan.  At  the  time  of  its  earliest  settlement  it  was  considered 
the  tit  home  of  the  Indians,  wild  beasts  and  malaria.  For  the  white  man  it 
was  uninhabited  and  unhabitable.  In  a  report  made  to  a  religious  body  regard- 
ing the  feasibility  of  establishing  missionary  stations  to  christianize  this  heathen 
wild,  it  was  stated  that  the  project  was  impracticable  '•  because  only  a  narrow 
strip  along  the  border  of  the  territory  was  inhabitable,  the  interior  being  a  vast 
and  impenetrable  swamp."  The  surveyor  general  of  Ohio  in  1815,  after  speak- 
ing of  the  "swamps  alternating  with  barren  sands  which  make  up  the  great 
mass  of  the  interior."  says:  "Taking  the  country  altogether,  so  far  as  has  been 
explored  and  to  all  appearances,  together  with  the  information  received  concern- 
ing the  balance,  it  is  so  bad  there  would  not  be  more  than  one  acre  out  of  a 
hundred,  if  there  would  be  one  out  of  a  thousand,  that  would  in  any  case  admit 
of   cultivation." 

Such  statements  only  awaken  a  smile  now  that  the  territory  has  been  explored 
and  settled;  for  here  was  found,  not  indeed  the  Eden  of  old  guarded  by  flam- 
ing sword,  but  an  earthly  paradise  clasped  in  the  loving  arms  of  "the  vast 
unsalted  seas."  The  nature  of  the  soil  and  the  climatic  conditions  were  found 
to  be  admirably  fitted  for  all  the  agricultural  products  of  the  temperate  zone 
and  unsurpassed  for  most  fruits.  Soil  and  climate,  after  all  is  said,  are  the 
enduring  conditions  of  the  prosperity  of  a  people.  Mines  will  finally  be  exhausted, 
forests  will  disappear,  commerce  may  find  new  channels,  but  soil  and  climate  are 
the  physical   basis  of  the  life  of  a  people;    they   are  a  possession   for  all   time. 

THE   DRAINAGE   LAW. 

One  cause  that  led  to  a  marked  change  in  the  condition  of  our  State  and 
the  public  estimate  in  which  it  was  held  was  the  drainage  law.  whereby  each  land 
owner  was  compelled  to  bear  his  just  part  of  expense  in  draining  a  district,  and  no 
churl  could  block  the  drainage  of  a  neighborhood  because  he  chanced  to  control 
the  outlet.    A  large  area  of  worthless  swamp  v^^as  thus  reclaimed  to  useful  purposes

and  malaria  banished.     No  law  since  the  giving  of  the  ten  commandments  has  pro- 
duced more  good  and  inflicted  less  evil. 

AGRICULTURAL   CAPABILITY    OF    THESE    SOILS. 

The  capacity  of  the  soi  1  in  the  southern  counties  of  the  State  for  the  production 
of  grains  is  wide  known.  Wheat,  corn,  oats,  and  barley  find  here  the  fitting  and 
enduring  conditions  for  growth.  The  distinctive  wheat  belt  embraces  .the  four 
southern  tiers  of  counties.  Other  counties  will  produce  large  crops  oi  wheat,  but 
me  counties  named  are  distinguished  in  this  respect.  Characteristic  specimens  of 
wheat  soil  are  shown  in  the  display  of  Michigan  soils  in  the  Michigan  building, 
Nos.  1  to  90.  The  analyses  of  these  soils  is  given  by  labels  attached  to  each  jar. 
The  remarkable  productiveness  of  some  of  these  soils  is  shown  in  No.  1,  from 
Lenawee  county,  a  soil  that  had  been  in  continuous  cropping  for  forty  years  with- 
out manure,  yet  it  produced  83  bushels  of  shelled  corn  to  the  acre  in  1879.  The 
production  of  40  bushels  of  wheat  to  the  acre  has  often  been  secured  in  these 
counties. 

SOIL   SPECIMENS   ON   EXHIBITION. 

Thirty-eight  different  kinds  of  soils  from  widely  reported  localities  are  placed  on 
exhibition  with  a  statement  of  the  chemical  composition,  the  kind  of  timber  naturally 
growing  on  them  and  a  brief  statement  of  their  physical  qualities.  Attention  is 
called  to  this  collection  of  Michigan  soils.  They  are  not  unusual  and  extraordi- 
nary specimens  gathered  to  astonish  and  mislead,  but  the  average  soils  of  the  county 
or  locality.  The  are  ordinary  and  not  extraordinary,  and  hence  more  valuable  for 
presenting  the  truth. 

SOILS   OF    THE   FRUIT    BELT, 

The  whole  State  produces  apples  of  the  highest  quality,  and  "Michigan  apples" 
are  quoted  as  the  type  of  excellence  in  all  the  States  east  of  the  Rocky  mountains. 
The  special  fitness  of  the  southeastern  part  of  the  State  to  raise'grapes  is  shown 
by  the  name  River  Raisin,  so  named  because  of  the  abundance  of  wild  grapes  that 
grow  along  its  banks. 

But  the  name  "Fruit  Belt"  has  been  more  particularly  applied  to  the  counties 
on  our  western  border,  under  the  lee  of  Lake  Michigan,  where  the  peach  has  found 
a  home  and  where  other  fruits  flourish.  Nine  specimens  of  soil — Nos.  10  to  18 — 
are  shown.  The  soils  show  wide  range  in  physical  appearance  and  chemical  com- 
position. The  peach  belt  is  produced  by  climatic  conditions  more  than  by  the 
nature  of  the  soil. 

The  counties  forming  "The  thumb,"  south  of  Saginaw  bay  and  bordering  on 
Lake  Huron,  are  distinguished  for  the  excellent  quality  of  their  plums. 

THE   POTATO    DISTRICT, 

While  potatoes  of  excellent  quality  are  raised  in  all  parts  of  the  State,  a  district 
around  Grand  Traverse  bay,  consisting  of  the  counties  of  Grand  Traverse,  Benzie, 
Leelanaw  and  Antrim,  is  distinguished  for  its  superior  quality  of  potatoes.  The 
soil  bore  a  very  heavy  growth   of   hardwood  trees,  the   hard  maple   very  abundant.

26  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

The  soil  is  open  and  porous  and  the  tubers  are  protected  from  frost  when  left  in 
the  ground  all  winter  by  reason  of  the  heavy  coating  of  snow  which  falls  before 
the  ground  is  frozen.  They  may  thus  be  wintered  in  the  hill,  and  when  dug  in 
the  spring  have  the  same  crisp,  mealy  quality  so  prized  in  potatoes  first  dug  from 
the  ground  in  the  fall  in  other  localities.  These  spring  dug  potatoes  may  yet 
become  an  important  element  of  market  gardening.  Specimens  of  these  soils— Nos. 
19,  20  and  21— are  on  exhibition. 

THE    JACK    PINE    PLAINS. 

These  are  extensive  tracts  of  light,  sandy  soil  in  the  northern  central  part  of  the 
lower  peninsula  bearing  a  light  forest  growth  of  dwarf  pines  and  scarlet  oak,  with 
a  few  trees  of  Norway  pine.  The  Pinus  banksiana,  or  Jack  pine,  is  the  leading 
forest  growth,  and  the  region  is  known  as  the  Jack  pine  plains.  The  experiment 
station  of  the  college  has  made  some  experiments  on  the  Jack  pine  soil  to  see  what 
could  be  done  by  the  use  of  what  the  soil  contains,  what  could  be  gathered  from 
the  atmosphere,  and  the  mineral  materials  found  in  abundance  in  the  small  lakes 
of  this  region,  to  bring  such  soil  into  productive  eonditions.  The  raising  and  plow- 
ing under  of  green  crops  and  the  application  of  marl  have  been  the  principal  means 
employed.  Three  specimens  of  such  soil  from  Grayling,  Crawford  county,  are 
exhibited.  No.  22  is  the  soil  in  its  natural  condition;  Nos.  23  and  24  contain  soils 
which  have  raised  crops  of  sperry,  vetch  and  peas,  the  same  plowed  under  for 
green  manuring;  No.  25  is  the  marl  found  so  abundantly  in  small  lakes  and 
swamps.  The  change  in  physical  properties  will  be  evident  on  inspection,  and  the 
chemical  changes  will  appear  from  the  analysis  showing  how  the  insoluble  mate- 
rials may  become  soluble  by  the  transforming  influence  of  green  manuring. 

SOILS   FOR    EXCEPTIONAL   CROPS. 

While  Michigan  soils  are  good  for  the  every-year  use  of  the  farmer  and  fruit 
grower,  there  are  certain  soils  which  are  invaluable  for  the  growth  of  special  crops. 
These  special  productions  have  of  late  years  come  to  the  front  in  a  way  to  chal- 
lenge the  attention  of  the  whole  country.  Singularly  enough  these  crops  are  raised 
on  the  kind  of  soil  once  held  to  be  the  opprobrium  of  our  State,  "the  Michigan 
swamps."  Passing  by  the  enormous  crops  of  timothy  hay  now  raised  on  tamarack 
swamps,  I  need  only  mention  celery,  cranberries  and  peppermint,  which  are  now 
grown  on  this  mucky  soil  in  perfection.  Specimens  of  the  soil  suited  to  each  of 
these  crops  and  their  analysis  are  exhibited  for  the  information  of  the  public.  No. 
26  is  a  sample  of  muck  contributed  by  the  Dunkley  Celery  Co.,  of  Kalamazoo,  on 
which  is  raised  celery  of  such  excellence  that  Kalamazoo  celery  has  acquired  a 
national  reputation.  No.  27  is  muck  from  the  celery  plantation  of  Geo.  Hancock, 
of  Grand  Haven,  whose  celery  has  a  good  reputation  among  the  lovers  of  this 
delicious  vegetable.  No.  28  is  muck  sent  by  the  Newberry  Celery  and  Improvement 
Co.,  of  Newberry,  Luce  county.  The  director  of  the  Newberry  company  writes: 
"We  ship  you  this  day  by  express  a  sample  of  soil  taken  from  our  garden  for  the 
purpose  of  having  it  placed  on  exhibition  at  the  World's  Fair  with  other  soils  of 
this  State.  On  this  soil  we  have  produced  the  finest  celery  grown  in  the  State. 
The  celery  grown  here  has  a  fine  nutty  flavor  unknown  to  the  celery  grown  in  the 


Michigan  Soils.  27 


southern  part  of  the  State.  We  have  also  grown  large  crops  of  grain  and  hay  on 
this  land.  Two  years  ago  we  seeded  one  and  a  half  acres  to  spring  rye,  which 
yielded  seventy  bushels  of  fine  plump  grain.  From  this  one  and  one-half  acres  we 
cut  three  and  one-half  tons  of  hay.  The  soil  is  from  sixteen  feet  to  unknown  depth. 
There  are  thousands  of  acres  of  the  same  character  of  soil  in  our  vicinity.  We 
would  also  say  that  during  the  eight  years  we  have  been  growing  celery  here  we 
have  not  had  a  failure  of  a  crop." 

PEPPERMINT    LANDS. 

I  wrote  to  a  gentleman  in  the  peppermint  district  asking  for  a  specimen  of  the 
■soil  for  raising  peppermint,  and  not  receiving  the  specimen,  I  wrote  again  and 
received     the    following    reply:      "  Your     first     communication     was     referred     to 

Mr. ,  of   this  town,  who  is  the  largest  mint  raiser  in  the  State,  and  who 

promised  me  he  would  forward  the  soil  desired,  but  I  saw  him  this  morning  and 
he  said  the  ground  was  so  frozen  he  could  not  get  it  without  being  to  greater 
expense  than  he  wished  to  incur.  The  facts  are  he  does  not  want  published  to 
the  world  the  benefits  of  reclaiming  marsh  lands,  for  that  is  all  there  is  of  it.  Any 
marsh  land  that  can  be  drained  so  it  can  be  worked  and  still  hold  moisture  enough 
to  carry  the  crop  through  is  good  enough  mint  soil.  Moisture  is  the  great  secret. 
It  must  have  moisture  enough  to  retain  the  leaves  until  it  is  in  bloom,  for  all  of 
the  oil  is  in  the  leaves." 

Evidently  Mr. has  a  good  thing,  and  is  willing  to  keep  it. 

CRANBEREY    SOIL. 

I  also  wrote  to  a  successful  grower  of  cranberries  in  St.  Joseph  for  a  specimen 
of  cranberry  soil,  but  he  was  in  the  south  and  failed  to  get  my  letter  in  time. 
Some  time  ago  I  made  an  analysis  of  his  cranberry  soil  and  also  of  some  neigh- 
boring soil  that  would  not  raise  the  fruit.  The  most  marked  difference  in  these 
soils  was  that  the  barren  soil  was  very  acid,  while  the  fruitful  soil  was  neutral  to 
litmus  paper.  This  I  find  to  be  the  most  common  distinction  between  fertile  and 
barren  muck.  All  these  celery  soils  in  the  fresh  state  were  entirely  free  from  acid. 
All  the  muck  lands  in  the  State,  when  properly  drained,  and  in  a  suitable  physi- 
cal condition,  and  free  from  acid,  may  produce  large  crops  of  cranberries,  mint  and 
celery.    Muck  is  a  mine  for  the  skillful  cultivator. 

There  is  nothing  in  either  the  soil  or  the  climate,  or  other  natural  advantages  of 
Michigan,  which  exempts  those  who  settle  in  the  State  from  the  common  conditions 
of  success  in  every  part  of  the  world.  If  a  man  without  means  chooses  to  lead  an 
idle  and  thriftless  life,  he  can  starve  to  death  here  as  soon  as  anywhere  else.  But 
there  is  no  portion  of  the  Union,  either  in  the  states  or  territories,  which  offers 
larger  encouragement  to  industry  and  economy.  The  laborer,  seeking  employment 
with  an  honest  desire  to  earn  a  living,  and  willing  to  render  a  fair  day's  work  for 
a  fair  day's  wages,  can  always,  under  ordinary  business  conditions,  find  something 
to  do  for  which  he  will  be  well  paid.  A  few  years  of  labor  and  frugality,  in  which 
steadiness  and  growing  experience  will,  as  in  every  other  pursuit,  enhance  from 
year  to  year  the  value  and  compensation  of  his  services,  will  ensure  savings  enough 
to  buy  land.  If  he  has  chosen  one  of  the  newer  sections  of  the  State  for  his  resi- 
dence he  may  readily  secure  a  farm  in  the  neighborhood  to  which  he  has  become 


28  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

accustomed,  at  low  prices  and  on  easy  terms,  and  the  same  qualities  which  gave 
him  a  start  will  establish  his  prosperity  and  independence  on  a  sure  and  enduring 
basis. 

It  is  not  alone  the  work  of  the  farm  that  affords  openings  to  labor.  The  mines, 
furnaces,  lumber  camps,  mills,  manufactories,  and  mechanic  arts  of  the  State,  con- 
tinually increasing  in  number  and  variety,  furnish  a  growing  and  diversified 
demand  for  every  kind  of  employment  that  a  man  can  pursue  either  with  his  head 
or  his  hands.  And  there  is  no  region  on  earth  where  brains  and  muscle  can  work 
more  advantageously  together. 


DIVERSITY  OF  LABOR. 


The  range  of  labor  in  Michigan  is  great.  Some  branches  of  industry  are  not  found 
€uch  as  the  raising  of  oranges  and  bananas,  the  manufacture  of  whisky  (except- 
ing possibly  moonshiners)  or  digging  for  diamonds.  But  there  is  a  great  diversity 
of  labor  and  nearly  every  kind  of  industry  is  carried  on.  One  peculiarity  is  notice- 
able. Labor  is  performed  on  the  most  approved  plans.  The  best  of  machinery  and 
appliances  are  used.  This  is  accounted  for  by  the  fact  that  Michigan's  popula- 
tion is  drawn  from  the  most  enterprising  element  of  other  states.  Drones  stay  in 
the  old  states,  enterprising  young  men  seek  new  fields.  Michigan  as  a  manufact- 
uring state  employs  the  best  skill  and  enterprise  to  be  found  and  the  results  very 
clearly  establish  the  wisdom  of  this  plan.  The  cost  of  power  is  more  in  Michigan 
than  in  the  coal  regions  of  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania,  but  much  less  than  in  the  western 
states.  There  is  plenty  of  coal  in  Michigan,  but  water  transportation  makes  the 
cost  of  fuel  reasonable.  Taken  with  the  fact  that  the  State  has  an  abundant  supply 
of  wood  for  fuel  for  family  purposes,  there  is  but  little  anxiety  about  the  question 
ot  supply.  Lumber  is  cheap,  land  is  cheap,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  labor  in 
Michigan  cannot  result  in  comfortable  homes.  An  order  for  any  manufactured 
article  excepting  glass  can  be  filled  in  Michigan  by  Michigan  products. 

In  farming  success  follows  intelligent  labor  as  surely  as  in  any  state.  There  are 
vast  tracts  of  land  in  the  State  patiently  awaiting  the  manipulation  of  intelligent 
labor.  Land  easily  accessible  and  close  to  good  markets.  Unlike  the  description  of 
a  part  of  the  wilds  of  West  Virginia  by  a  fourth  of  July  orator,  who  said  "  there 
were  places  in  West  Virginia  that  the  foot  of  man  had  never  trod  and  the  eye  of 
God  had  never  seen,"  Michigan  is  peculiarly  favored  in  location,  as  are  nearly  all 
peninsulas.  The  labor  of  the  farmer  has  paid  above  the  average.  Extremes  of  wet 
and  dry  weather,  heat,  cold  and  wind,  are  not  common.  Taking  all  things  into 
consideration  labor  is  fairly  remunerated.  Years  to  come,  with  transportation  for 
.all   production,  there   can  be  no  doubt  of  employment  in  Michigan. 


FARMING. 


Farming  is  a  much  abused  industry.  There  are  a  very  large  number  of  people 
styled  farmers  and  who  claim  to  be  farmers,  but  few  real  farmers.  A  real  farmer , 
possessing  the  requisite  qualificaions,  always  succeeds. 

What  is  a  farmer?  "One  who  cultivates  land"  (Webster).  The  act  of  cultivat- 
ing land  in  this  connection  would  imply,  of  course,  proper,  full,  correct  cultivation ; 
one  who  understands  the  soil;  how,  when,  where,  and  what  to  plant;  how  to  culti- 
vate and  take  care  of,  to  cure  and  harvest  crops;  to  do  all  things  pertaining  to  the 
business  in  the  proper  way  at  the  proper  time. 

This  involves  a  liberal  stock  of  knowledge  and  adaptability  to  the  work.  A  man 
who  never  saw  a  farm  buys  some  land,  a  team,  some  tools,  seed,  etc.,  moves  to  a 
farm  and  is  immediately  rated  as  a  farmer.  Should  he  trade  his  farm  for  a  black- 
smith shop  and  take  charge  would  that  act  make  him  a  blacksmith?  He  opens  a 
select  school,  would  that  act  make  him  competent  to  teach?  Should  he  buy  a 
physician's  practice  would  that  act  make  him  competent  to  practice  medicine? 

There  is  much  to  learn  in  connection  with  farming.  Many  follow  the  business 
through  life  and  never  learn.  Farmers  may  be  classed  under  three  heads:  First, 
those  who  know  nothing  of  the  business;  second,  habitual  and  instinctive  farmers; 
third,  scientific  farmers.-  The  first  fail,  and  generally  become  politicians,  and  next 
calamity  howlers.  Everything  goes  wrong.  It  is  too  dry,  or  too  wet,  too  hot  or  too 
cold,  frost  always  kills  his  fruit,  he  cannot  get  a  price  for  anything  and  has  to  pay 
too  much  for  everything  he  buys.  The  second  class  hold  their  own,  and  the  rise  of  the 
price  of  land  sometimes  makes  them  wealthy.  The  third  class  are  the  successful 
ones.  Their  farms  wear  a  look  of  prosperity  and  comfort.  Crops  are  good,  stock 
well  fed  and  well  bred,  buildings  are  good  and  homes  comfortable,  fences  in  good 
order,  no  run  down  land,  no  mortgages.  He  makes  a  compost  heap  and  does  not 
allow  the  alkalies  to  eat  up  the  acids.  He  knows  what  kind  of  fertilizer  his  weak 
land  needs.  While  number  one  is  talking  politics  and  complaining  he  is  analyzing 
his  soil  and  fertilizers.    He  succeeds,  and  ought  to. 

One  great  mistake  made  by  farmers  is  undertaking  to  farm  on  40  acres.  It  is  too 
little  land  for  general  farming.  The  woodland  must  be  kept,  the  garden  is  neces- 
sary. The  cows  and  horses  necessary  for  farming  40  acres  would  do  for  80;  fencing 
for  40  is  nearly  as  much  as  for  80,  if  properly  divided.  If  40  acres  will  support  a 
family  the  products  of  the  surplus  over  40  is  clear.  One  hundred  and  sixty  acres 
is  not  too  much  for  a  small  farm.    At  $10  per  acre  (and  thousands  of  acres  can  be

bought  for  less)  160  acres  will  cost  Sl,600,  40  acres  will  cost  $400,  81,200  diflference. 
If  the  farm  is  workable  the  81,600  will  be  paid  with  more  ease  than  §400  on  40 
acres,  (The  same  proportions  will  not  hold  good  indefinitely.)  It  does  not  pay  to 
hold  unproductive  land  except  timber  land.  Very  many  think  the  vacant  lands  are 
all  State  lands.  This  is  not  correct.  There  are  more  vacant  lands  owned  by  indi- 
viduals and  corporations  than  by  the  State,  which  can  be  bought  cheap,  and  even 
improved  land  can  be  bought  at  reasonable  rates.  It  is  said  the  average  Michigan 
man  will  sell  anything  but  his  family. 


HORTICULTURAL  RESOURCES  OF  MICHIGAN. 


BY   L.    R.   TAFT,   AGRICULTURAL   COLLEGE. 


Ten  years  ago  when  the  name  of  our  State  was  mentioned  to  the  people  of  some 
of  her  sister  states,  it  was  generally  associated  in  the  mind  of  the  listener  with 
some  of  the  crops  for  the  raising  of  which  her  fame  is  world  wide.  Desirable  as 
may  have  been  her  reputation  for  the  raising  of  corn,  oats,  wheat,  wool  and  other 
agricultural  products,  with  which  the  people  not  only  of  this  but  of  foreign  coun- 
tries have  been  fed  and  clothed,  the  renown  obtained  from  her  Michigan  apples 
was  far  greater.  Today,  although  no  other  state  can  equal  her  in  the  size,  color  and 
quality  of  this  the  most  important  of  all  fruits,  the  increased  attention  given  to  the 
growing  of  peaches,  plums  and  grapes  has  forced  the  apple  to  give  up  some  of  its 
glory  in  the  race  for  fame. 

Moreover,  proud  as  Michigan  horticulturists  are  of  the  reputation  so  nobly  won 
and  so  richly  deserved  for  the  production  of  luscious  fruits,  they  are  not  content 
with  this,  but  have  pushed  forward  in  other  lines,  and  today  the  renown  of  Kala- 
mazoo celery  and  Grand  Rapids  lettuce  has  extended  until  it  has  reached  the 
Atlantic  shore  on  the  east  and  has  surmounted  the  summits  of  the  Rockies  on  the 
west. 

The  State  owes  its  success  in  these  lines  to  three  things:  First,  skill  and  indus- 
try of  her  horticulturists;  second,  the  advantageous  location  with  large  bodies  of 
water  upon  three  sides;  third,  the  possession  of  a  variety  of  soils  most  of  which 
are  particularly  adapted  to  horticulture  and  which  are  arranged  in  a  gentle  undu- 
lating manner  that  is  favorable  to  both  water  and  air  drainage. 

Another  thing  that  has  been  of  inestimable  benefit  in  stimulating  the  people  in 
horticultural  work  is  the  excellent  market  facilities  enjoyed. 

Not  only  do  the  railroads  radiate  to  all  parts  of  the  country,  but  being  sur- 
rounded upon  three  sides  by  the  great  lakes,  very  cheap  water  rates  can  be 
secured.  Not  only  do  Detroit,  Grand  Rapids,  Saginaw,  and  hundreds  of  other 
thriving  cities  stretch  out  their  hands  to  be  fed,  but  Michigan  grapes,  peaches, 
plums,  strawberries,  etc.,  find  a  ready  market  in  all  of  the  adjoining  states.  From 
at  least  a  dozen  harbors  upon  the  lake  shores  large  steamers  laden  to  their  gun- 
wales with  fruit  and  vegetables  make  daily  trips  to  Chicago  and  Milwaukee,  from 
which  points  the  surplus  is  distributed  through  the  northwest.     While  the  temper- 


HORTICULTUEAL    EeSOURCES    OF    MICHIGAN. 


ing  influence  of  Lake  Michigan  upon  the  cold  southwest  and  westerly  winds  makes 
a  narrow  strip  along  its  shore  particularly  adapted  to  the  growing  of  some  of  the 
more  tender  fruits,  a  large  part  of  the  land  in  the  counties  that  make  up  the 
eix  southern  tiers  can  be  used  to  advantage  for  fruit  growing.  Nearly,  if  not  all, 
the  counties  in  the  southern  peninsula  have  land  that  will  grow  all  of  the  hardier 
fruits.  The  northern  peninsula  seems  well  adapted  to  growing  currants,  goose- 
berries, raspberries,  strawberries,  and  other  small  fruits.  The  large  fruits  also 
eeem  to  thrive  in  properly  selected  locations. 

THE   STRAWBERRY. 

Although  the  demand  for  this  fruit  has  repeatedly  doubled  it  has  never  out- 
stripped the  supply.  A  few  years  ago  a  single  crate  would  perhaps  cause  a  glut  of 
the  market,  in  a  small  town,  where  now  a  wagon  load  can  be  disposed  of  readily. 
There  are  a  few  localities  in  the  State  where  this  fruit,  if  given  a  well  drained  soil 
and  proper  care,  will  not  thrive.  While  it  seems  to  do  best  upon  a  rich  sandy  soil, 
almost  any  soil  from  a  light  sand  to  a  heavy  clay  can  be  used  for  growing  it.  As 
usually  grown  the  plants  are  set  about  eighteen  inches  apart,  in  rows  from  three 
and  one-half  to  four  feet  wide.  The  plants  are  thoroughly  cultivated  the  flrpt  sea- 
eon  and  are  allowed  to  form  matted  rows  covering  about  one-half  of  the  ground 
and  leaving  rows  for  the  pickers  to  work  in. 

If  large  and  fine  fruit  will  bring  an  extra  price  it  will  often  pay  to  layer  a  few 
of  the  plants  and  remove  all  runners  that  form  later  in  the  season.  As  soon  as 
the  runners  begin  to  form  the  stronger  ones  are  selected  and  are  layered  over  a 
strip  so  that  they  will  stand  eight  or  ten  inches  apart.  If  the  others  are  nipped 
off  as  soon  as  they  appear  the  entire  vigor  of  the  plant  will  be  used  in  forming 
strong  crowns.  In  this  way,  the  stronger  runners  can  be  selected  and  as  they  will 
have  all  of  the  food  and  moisture,  instead  of  sharing  it  with  hundreds  of  other 
plants,  the  growth  secured  will  be  able  to  develop  a  large  number  of  plants  and 
fruit.  Particularly  if  the  season  is  a  dry  one  the  crop  will  equal  that  secured  from 
a  thick  matted  row^,  and  the  price  obtained  for  the  fruit  will  be  much  more  than 
could  be  secured  for  fruit  grown  in  any  other  way. 

Frequently,  too,  it  might  happen  that  in  case  there  is  a  glut  in  the  market  the 
choice  fruit  can  be  sold  at  a  satisfactory  price  while  the  others  will  be  wasted. 

Although  most  varieties  do  best  in  matted  rows,  others  give  good  returns  when 
grown  in  hills.  For  field  culture  these  are  generally  planted  about  one  by  two  and 
one-half  feet,  and  all  runners  are  cut  off  that  start  during  the  season.  In  the 
home  garden,  if  placed  in  beds  with  five  rows  one  foot  apart  each  way  and  a  nar- 
row walk  between  the  beds,  a  large  quantity  of  fruit  can  be  grown  upon  a  very  small 
area.  Particularly  when  grown  upon  heavy  soils  a  good  mulch  of  marsh  hay,  straw 
or  similar  material  is  applied  in  the  fall  as  soon  as  the  ground  has  frozen.  While 
the  depth  over  the  plants  should  not  be  much  more  than  an  inch,  a  considerable 
greater  depth  may  be  applied  between  the  rows.  This  will  prevent  the  alternate 
freezing  and  thawing  and  the  consequent  breaking  of  the  roots  and  heaving  of  the 
plants.  As  spring  opens  the  mulch  should  be  removed  from  over  the  plants.  It 
may  be  left  to  cover  the  ground  between  the  rows  with  a  cultivator.  Whether 
mulched  in  the  winter  or  not,  something  of  the  kind  is  desirable  during  the  fruit- 
ing season  as  it  serves  to  keep  the  sand  from  washing  upon  the  plants  and  to  hold

the  moisture  and  thus  prevent  the  drying  of  the  plants  in  time  of  drouth.  The 
spring  set  plants  bear  a  full  crop  the  following  summer.  As  a  rule  the  plantation 
is  then  freed  from  grass  and  weeds  and  retained  for  another  year. 

As  a  rule  girls  and  women  are  preferred  as  pickers  to  boys  as  better  work  is 
done  by  them.  Various  methods  of  managing  the  pickers  and  keeping  account  of 
the  amount  picked  are  in  use. 

Perhaps  the  most  common  method  is  to  furnish  each  picker  with  a  light  carrier 
holding  four  one  quart  boxes.  He  is  then  started  upon  a  row  and  gathers  the 
berries,  cutting  each  of  the  stems  off  close  to  the  hulls  with  the  thumb  nail.  When 
the  boxes  are  full,  the  pickers  generally  carry  them  to  the  packing  shed  where 
they  receive  a  ticket  for  the  four  quarts. 

A  better  way,  however,  and  one  that  is  in  use  by  several  large  growers,  is  to 
have  one  or  more  reliable  pickers  whose  business  it  is  to  gather  up  the  boxes  as 
they  are  filled  and  deliver  them  to  the  packer. 

In  this  way  much  of  the  confusion  and  loss  of  place  by  the  pickers,  that  is  so 
common  when  the  other  plan  is  used,  is  prevented. 

When  sold  in  a  fastidious  market  the  berries  are  generally  assorted  into  two  or 
three  grades,  only  the  large  and  perfect  berries  being  placed  in  the  first  class.  If 
the  boxes  are  nicely  packed,  with  the  upper  layer  faced,  they  will  bring  consider- 
ably more  than  berries  put  up  in  a  careless  manner. 

While  the  supply  for  all  of  the  villages  and  small  cities  is  generally  grown  in  the 
immediate  vicinity,  some  localities  have  large  areas  devoted  to  the  raising  of  straw- 
berries for  shipment  to  other  states. 

The  most  extensive  plantations  are  in  the  vicinity  of  St.  Joseph  and  Benton 
Harbor,  although  many  are  grown  in  Van  Buren,  Allegan,  Ottawa,  Kent  and 
Muskegon   counties. 

RASPBERRIES   AND    BLACKBERRIES. 

Closely  following  the  strawberry  in  season  come  the  raspberry,  red  and  black, 
and  the  blackberry.  Not  only  is  there  a  large  local  demand  in  the  larger  villages 
and  cities,  but  they  are  shipped  by  rail  and  boat  to  Chicago  and  Milwaukee  in 
large  quantities. 

In  several  sections  of  the  State,  where  these  fruits  thrive  exceptionally  well, 
there  are  large  evaporators,  and  plantations  of  from  30  to  50  acres  are  grown  to 
supply  them. 

When  placed  upon  well  drained  and  moderately  rich  soil  the  crop  is  almost  a 
sure  one.  For  evaporating  purposes  the  Ohio  blackberry  is  generally  grown,  while 
the  Gregg  is  the  favorite  for  market'purposes.  The  early  varieties  of  blackberry 
are  most  profitable,  and  the  Early  Harvest,  with  slight  winter  protection,  is  pre- 
ferred to  all  other  kinds  by  growers  in  the  vicinity  of  Benton  Harbor  where  from 
20  to  40  acres  are  devoted  to  this  one  variety  by  several  planters. 

CURRANTS    AND   GOOSEBERRIES. 

These  fruits  seem  at  home  and  consequently  thrive  in  all  sections  of  Michigan, 
particularly  in  the  southern  and  western  portions.  Large  areas  are  grown  for  market 
purposes  and  they  prove  very  remunerative  crops.    The  Chicago  market  in  partic- 


Horticultural  Eesoueces  of  Michigan.  35 

ular  takes  immense  quantities  of  both  fruits,  and  as  they  only  thrive  in  the  cooler 
portions  of  the  country  there  is  little  or  no  opposition  from  the  south. 

While  the  Downing  is  the  variety  of  gooseberry  most  commonly  grown,  the  Industry 
and  other  large  sorts  of  European  origin  can  be  grown  with  good  success  in  many 
parts  of  the  State  where  the  soil  is  deep,  cool  and  moist. 

In  some  localities  the  currant  borer  has  been  so  destructive  to  the  cherry  and 
similar  varieties  that  they  are  little  planted  for  market  purposes,  the  principal 
reliance  being  upon  the  Victoria  and  Red  Dutch, 

The  demand  for  white  currant  is  comparatively  small  and  the  black  varieties 
are  but  little  grown. 

CRANBERRIES. 

Within  the  past  ten  years  the  interest  in  this  fruit  has  rapidly  increased,  and  it 
is  likely  that  within  a  short  time  the  home  grown  berries  will  supply  the  demand. 
There  are  thousands  of  acres  of  marsh  land  in  the  State  that  are  well  adapted  to 
this  crop  and  at  the  present  prices  it  will  be  a  profitable  one.  The  largest  planta- 
tion is  the  Comings  marsh,  in  Berrien  county,  near  St,  Joseph. 

THE   NURSERY   INDUSTRY. 

The  propagation  of  fruit  trees  in  Michigan  dates  back  to  the  time  of  the  early 
French  settlements,  and  although  many  of  the  old  apple  and  pear  trees  that  are 
still  growing  near  several  of  the  old  French  towns  and  Indian  villages  were  brought 
from  Montreal,  others  were  grown  from  seed. 

The  extent  to  which  fruit,  both  large  and  small,  is  grown,  requires  annually  many 
thousand  trees  for  the  planting  of  new  orchards,  and  many  of  these  are  the  prod- 
uct of  Michigan  nurseries. 

Nearly  every  county  in  the  southern  half  of  the  State  has  several  nurseries  and 
many  of  the  firms  are  doing  an  extensive  business.  Along  the  lake  shore  counties 
in  the  peach  district  are  a  large  number  of  nurseries  which  are  principally  devoted 
to  the  growing  of  peach  trees  for  local  planting.  From  150  to  200  acres  are  used 
in    these   sections, 

MARKET   GARDENING. 

While  the  truck  farmer  grows  but  two  or  three  kinds  of  vegetables  and  thes"? 
on  a  large  scale,  the  market  gardener  cultivates  a  full  variety  of  and  endeavors,  by 
careful  selection  of  varieties,  to  prolong  the  season.  His  products  are  sold  to 
market  men,  or  retailed  from  the  wagon.  Our  large  manufacturing  towns 
and  cities  consume  immense  quantities  of  fresh  vegetables,  and  good  prices  can 
generally  be  obtained.  Not  only  is  the  climate  adapted  to  the  growing  of  a  great 
variety  of  vegetables,  but  light  sandy  loam  soil  suitable  for  the  purpose  can  be 
found  in  most  localities.  In  addition  to  the  sale  of  the  vegetables,  most  gar- 
deners are  able  to  add  to  their  income  by  the  sale  of  vegetable  plants.  The 
canning  and  pickling  factories  of  the  State  use  immense  quantities  of  tomatoes, 
and  the  growing  of  sweet  corn,  tomatoes  and  seeds,  particularly  of  beans,  give 
employment  to  thousands  of  men.  Cabbages  have  been  produced  in  Muskegon 
county  weighing   67   pounds  per  head  and  of  first   quality.

THE    POTATO, 

while  grown  successfully  and  to  a  considerable  extent  in  all  parts  of  the  State, 
is  to  the  northern  half  of  the  lower  peninsula  the  leading  money  crop  of  the 
farmer.  Upon  soil  that  will  not  produce  remunerative  grain  crops  and  where  the 
late  springs  and  early  fall  frosts  render  the  corn  an  uncertain  crop,  the  potato 
thrives.  Not  only  is  the  yield  as  a  rule  satisfactory  but  the  tubers  are  large, 
smooth  and  of  exceedingly  fine  quality.  There  has  been  little  or  no  loss  from 
potato  rot  and  blight  and  the  Colorado  beetle  is  each  year  becoming  less  trouble- 
■some.  The  acreage  is  each  year  increasing  and  from  several  small  railroad  stations 
50,000  to  150,000  bushels  are  shipped  annually.  In  the  loose  sandy  loam  soil, 
machinery  can  be  used  for  planting,  cultivating  and  harvesting,  and  the  cost  of 
production  thus  reduced  to  the  minimum  while  their  superior  flavor  and  keeping 
-qualities  place  them  at   the  top  of  the  market. 

CELERY. 

Pew  crops  have  done  more  to  keep  our  State  in  the  minds  of  the  people  of  the 
distant,  as  well  as  the  neighboring  states,  than  the  celery  from  Kalamazoo  and 
other  sections. 

It  is  now  some  fifteen  years  since  the  first  celery  was  shipped,  but  it  is  only 
within  the  last  ten  years  that  the  business  began  to  take  on  its  present  mam- 
moth proportions.  Kalamazoo  has  within  a  radius  of  four  miles  3,000  acres  of 
marsh  land  adapted  to  this  crop.  The  land  is  first  drained  by  means  of  open 
ditches,  after  which  it  is  plowed  and  subdued. 

Manures  are  used  in  large  quantities  as  even  upon  this  rich  soil  they  cannot  be 
■  dispensed  with.  Seed  for  the  first  crop  is  sown  either  in  hot  beds  or  greenhouses 
early  in  March,  the  plants  are  set  out  in  May  and  the  crop  harvested  in  July.  A  sec- 
ond crop  is  set  out  in  June  to  be  harvested  in  August,  while  plants  for  winter  use  are 
set  the  last  of  July  or  the  first  of  August.  The  crops  for  summer  use  are  bleached 
with  boards  or  with  paper,  while  that  for  winter  use  is  hilled  up  with  earth. 

In  Kalamazoo  alone  there  are  some  thirty  firms  engaged  in  shipping  celery, 
and  the  industry  of  growing  the  crop  gives  employment  to  2,000  men.  The  daily 
shipments  amount  to  forty  or  fifty  tons  in  the  heighth  of  the  season.  Land 
equally  suited  to  the  crop  is  found  in  hundreds  of  other  places  in  the  State  and 
the  marshes  at  Kalamazoo,  Tecumseh  and  Durand  will  undoubtedly  find  strong 
competition. 

WINTER   FORCING   OF   LETTUCE. 

Until  recently  lettuce  has  been  known  as-  a  spring  and  summer  salad  crop,  and 
was  but  sparingly  grown  for  winter  use,  and  then  only  in  hot  beds  or  in  some 
spare  greenhouse  as  a  catch  crop  by  the  florists.  Some  six  or  eight  years  ago  the 
growing  of  winter  lettuce  as  a  commercial  greenhouse  crop  was  begun.  By  care- 
ful selection  a  variety  well  adapted  to  the  purpose  was  obtained,  which  is  now 
used  exclusively  by  the  growers  of  Grand  Rapids  and  has  become  known  all  over 
the  country  as  the  "  Grand  Rapids  variety  of  lettuce."  This  lettuce  was  so  attract- 
ive in  appearance  that  a  demand  at  once  sprang  up  for  it,  and  as  it  was  easily 
.grown  it  produced  a  very  profitable  crop.    The  business  soon  became  quite  exten- 


Horticultural  Eesources  of  Michigan.  37' 

sive.  Many  erected  houses  and  went  into  the  business  of  lettuce  growing.  The- 
Grand  Rapids  lettuce  soon  obtained  a  reputation  all  through  the  neighboring 
states,  and  regular  shipments  were  made  to  Detroit,  Cl;iicago,  Indianapolis,  Cleve- 
land, CJolumbus,  Cincinnati  and  other  large  cities,  and  although  the  prices  secured 
were  considerably  higher  than  lettuce  from  local  growers  could  be  obtained  for, 
the  demand  could  not  be  supplied.  While  some  of  the  houses  are  three-quarters 
span,  the  common  even  span  has  for  the  most  part  been  used  in  the  greenhouses 
erected  for  lettuce  growing.  The  houses  are  sometimes  heated  by  steam  and 
hot  water,  but  the  use  of  the  hot  air  flue  is  more  common.  The  furnaces  are 
placed  at  the  end  of  each  house,  or  if  they  are  long  a  furnace  is  constructed 
at  both  ends.  Flues  built  of  brick  or  of  vitrified  pipe  lead  from  these  furnaces 
through  the  house  and  back,  passing  up  as  a  chimney  over  the  furnace.  Three 
crops  are  taken  oflf  during  the  winter  and  as  the  variety  grown  can  be  planted 
quite  closely  the  profits  are  very  satisfactory.  The  prospects  for  this  industry 
are   very  flattering. 

TRUCK   FARMING. 

In  certain  localities  of  the  State  where  climatic  and  soil  conditions  are  favorable^ 
and  whence  there  is  ready  communication  with  large  cities,  this  new  industry  is  a 
favorite. 

The  term  applies  to  the  growing  of  one  or  more  vegetable  crops  upon  a  large 
scale  and  their  shipment  to  market  or  wholesale  dealers.  If  the  crops  are  properly 
handled  it  can  at  once  be  seen  that  the  large  trucker  can  grow  larger  and  better 
crops  and  can  place  them  on  the  market  at  a  lower  price  than  the  average  small 
grower.  Aside  from  the  celery  and  potatoes  which  have  been  mentioned  above  the 
principal  truck  crops  grown  in  Michigan  are  onions,  tomatoes  and  melons. 

The  onion  is  now  grown  in  large  quantities  on  swamp  land  in  various  parts  of 
the  State.  Upon  this  soil  large  yields  are  obtained  with  little  expense  for  labor 
and  nothing  at  all  for  fertilizers,  while  there  is  little  danger  of  injury  from  drouth. 
It  is  also  largely  grown  upon  the  uplands,  and  the  crops  thus  obtained,  on  account 
of  their  superior  flavor  and  keepitig  qualities,  bring  a  much  higher  price  than  those- 
grown  upon  the  low  land. 

In  localities  within  easy  reach  of  market  the  tomato  is  generally  found  to  be 
profitable  by  trucksters,  and  immense  quantities  are  grown,  particularly  in  Berrien 
county.  They  require  a  rich,  but  warm  and  early  soil,  and  with  good  selection  of 
varieties  and  well  grown  plants,  but  little  skill  is  required  to  grow  them. 

In  a  general  way  the  same  can  be  said  of  melon  growing.  The  water-melon  is 
not  very  largely  grown,  but  the  musk-melon  is  a  profitable  crop  and  is  quite 
largely  grown  by  trucksters,  especially  in  the  vicinity  of  Benton  Harbor. 

COMMERCIAL   FLORICULTURE. 

Where  ten  years  ago  one  would  seldom  see  flower  beds  in  the  yards  or  plants  in 
the  windows  the  reverse  is  now  the  rule,  and  this  gives  to  the  florist  a  large  sale 
of  bedding  and  house  plants.  The  principal  increase  in  the  business  of  the  florist 
has  been  in  the  sale  of  cut  flowers  for  the  adornment  of  the  person,  the  table  or 
the  parlor. 


38  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

Nearly  every  large  town  has  its  florist,  and  in  the  cities  particularly  the  busi- 
ness is  an  excellent  one.  In  addition  to  supplying  the  local  demand  for  plants 
and  flowers,  several  firms  have  a  large  shipping  trade  in  both,  the  flowers  being 
for  the  most  part  sent  to  commission  merchants  in  Chicago  and  the  plants  to 
florists  in  all  parts  of  the  country. 


MICHIGAN   AS  A   FRUIT  GROWING   STATE. 


BY   J.   G.    RAMSDELL. 


The  soil,  topography  and  climate  of  the  lower  peninsula  of  Michigan  is  well 
adapted  to  the  growing  of  every  variety  of  orchard  and  garden  fruit  that  can  be 
grown  north  of  the  thirty-seventh  parallel,  and  its  marketing  facilities  are  unequaled. 
Every  variety  of  apples,  pears,  plums  and  cherries  can  be  successfully  grown 
upon  nearly  every  farm,  and  the  peach  is  a  safe  and  profitable  crop  on  all  of 
the  high  rolling  lands  lying  within  thirty  miles  of  the  eastern  shore  of  Lake 
Michigan.  Grapes  do  well  on  the  hillsides  everywhere,  and  all  varieties  of  berries 
yield  large  annual  crops.  Successful  and  profitable  fruit  growing  depends  princi- 
pally upon  four  conditions:  First,  a  soil  naturally  adapted  to  a  strong  and  health- 
ful growth  of  trees  and  plants,  for  the  manuring  of  orchards  is  generally  difficult 
and  always  expensive.  Second,  topography  that  will  admit  of  free  and  rapid  atmos- 
pheric drainage  in  clear  cold  weather,  and  thus  aid  the  general  climate  in  pro- 
tecting trees  and  fruit  from  extreme  freezing  in  winter  and  from  damaging  ver- 
nal and  autumnal  frosts  during  the  blossoming  and  fruiting  season.  Third,  a 
climate  by  which  the  extreme  heat  and  blasting  winds  of  summer,  and  the  extreme 
cold  and  violent  storms  of  winter  are  tempered  to  harmless  conditions,  for  it  is 
not  the  general  average  of  heat  in  summer,  or  the  general  average  of  cold  in 
winter  that  the  orchardists  have  to  consider,  but  the  extremes  of  heat  that  blast 
and  the  extremes  of  cold  that  destroy,  that  he  has  to  fear.  Fourth,  a  ready 
and  convenient  market  with  cheap  and  rapid  transportation.  All  these  conditions 
are  more  completely  fulfilled  in  the  soil,  topography,  climate  and  market  facilities 
of  lower  Michigan  than  in  any  other  territory  of  equal  extent  in  the  union  of 
states. 

COMPOSITION    OF   SOIL. 

The  inorganic  substances  which  must  exist  in  a  soil  to  make  it  naturally  fertile 
— that  is  fertile  without  manuring— are  silica,  alumina,  lime,  magnesia,  oxide  of  iron, 
oxide  of  magnesia,  potash,  soda,  chlorine,  sulphuric  acid  and  carbonic  acid,  either 
free  or  combined  with  one  another,  or  with  other  substances.  A  soil  contain- 
ing these  ingredients  with  from  six  to  ten  per  cent  of  organic  matter  will  remain 
permanently  fertile  until  exhausting  crops  require  the  replacement  of  some  of 
these  ingredients.       The   rocks  from   which   the    soil    of    the    lower    peninsula   of 


40  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

Michigan  is  derived  furnish  all  these  inorganic  substances  in  great  abundance,, 
and  the  decomposition  of  ages  of  forest  growth  has  furnished  the  needed  supply 
of  organic  matter. 

At  some  period  in  the  geological  history  of  this  continent  there  was  a  great 
uplifting  in  the  Lake  Superior  region.  The  trap  and  granite  underlying  the  azoic 
formation  was  forced  up  through  all  the  superincumbent  strata  of  rocks,  upturn- 
ing the  broken  edges  to  the  surface.  During  the  subsequent  glacial  period  these 
strata  were  broken,  ground  and  pulverized  into  drift  material  and  spread  over 
lower  Michigan  to  a  great  depth,  varying  from  six  hundred  feet  in  the  northern 
to  fifty  feet  or  more   in   the  southern   part. 

The  rock  strata  thus  ground  up  and  commingled  are  composed  of  the  following 
geological  formations:  Trap  and  granite  in  every  variety  of  composition,  the  azoic 
formation;  the  Lake  Superior  or  Potsdam  sandstone,  highly  impregnated  with  per- 
oxide of  iron;  the  Trenton  group,  a  silicequs  limestone;  the  Hudson  river  group, 
an  argillaceous  limestone  abounding  in  fossils;  the  Clinton  group,  an  argillaceous 
calcareous  limestone;  the  Niagara  group,  a  crystalline  magnesian  limestone,  rich  in 
fossils;  the  Onondaga  salt  group,  rich  in  chloride  of  sodium  (salt)  and  sulphate  of 
lime  (gypsum);  the  Helderberg  group,  a  limestone  composed  largely  of  fossil  coral; 
the  Hamilton  group,  a  bituminous  limestone;  and  the  Huron  group,  a  dark  bitum- 
inous clayey  shale. 

Those  familiar  with  the  mineral  composition  of  the  several  rock  formations 
above  named  will  readily  see  the  extraordinary  richness  in  plant-feeding  elements 
of  a  soil  composed  of  the  mingled  constituents  of  these  rocks.  The  feldspar  and 
mica  of  the  trap  and  granite  furnish  an  abundance  of  potash;  the  fossil  remains 
of  the  limestone  rocks,  an  abundance  of  phosphates;  the  salt  and  gypsum  of  the 
Onondaga  salt  group,  an  abundance  of  these  materials.  The  ferrugineous  sandstone 
of  the  Potsdam  group  furnishes  the  iron  oxide  necessary  to  healthy  growth  and 
high  color  of  fruit  and  foliage;  the  mica,  feldspar  and  argillaceous  limestones  and 
shales  furnish  sufficient  alumina  to  give  the  proper  adhesiveness  to  the  soil,  and 
the  limestone  siliceous  rocks,  amply  supply  those  materials.  The  dense  forests  of 
deciduous  timber  that  originally  covered  the  most  of  the  State,  the  magnificent 
growth  of  oak,  ash,  maple  and  elm  which  composed  those  forests,  give  abundant 
evidence  of  the  fertility  of  the  soil  in  the  elements  of  vegetable  growth  and  con- 
firm the  conclusions  which  science   maintains. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The  lower  peninsula  is  bordered  on  the  west,  north,  and  east  by  lakes  Michigan, 
Huron,  St.  Clair  and  Erie.  The  watershed  that  divides  the  streams  flowing  into 
these  lakes  rises  te  the  height  of  600  feet  above  the  lakes  in  Hillsdale  county  in 
the  southern  part,  falling  gradually  northward  to  less  than  100  feet  between  the 
tributaries  of  the  Saginaw  river  and  the  Grand  in  Gratiot  county,  then  gradually 
rising  northward  until  it  reaches  an  elevation  of  over  1,000  feet  in  Otsego  county. 
The  largest  streams,  such  as  the  St.  Joseph,  Kalamazoo,  Grand,  Muskegon  and 
Manistee,  on  the  west,  and  the  Saginaw,  Huron  and  Raisin  on  the  east,  take  their 
rise  in  the  higher  lands  and  form  broad  fertile  valleys  along  their  course.  The 
divides  between  these  rivers  and  their  tributaries  form  gently  rolling  uplands, 
without  either  extended  plains  or  precipitous  hills.     On    the   higher  plateau  which 


Michigan  as  a  Fruit  Growing   State.  41 

forms  the  watershed  between  the  great  lakes,  numerous  lakes  abound  varying  fi'om 
a  few  acres  to  many  square  miles  in  extent.  The  natural  drainage  of  the 
whole  is  complete.  The  effect  of  the  topography  of  lower  Michigan  upon  the 
growing  of  fruit  will  be  considered  with  the 

CLIMATE. 

Lake  Michigan  has  an  average  depth  of  1,000  feet,  an  average  width  of  sixty  miles, 
and  contains  an  area  of  23,150  square  miles.  This  vast  body  of  water  lying  along 
the  west  and  northwest  border  forms  a  thermal  regulator,  absorbing  the  heat  of 
summer  and  gradually  yielding  it  up  again  to  temper  the  cold  of  winter,  thus 
avoiding  the  extremes  of  heat  and  cold  that  damage  foliage  in  summer  and 
injure   buds  and  trees  in  winter. 

The  prevailing  winds  in  winter  are  west  and  northwest.  These  winds,  passing 
over  the  open  water  of  Lake  Michigan  in  winter  are  raised  in  temperature  from 
ten  to  thirty  degrees;  so  that  storms  that  register  from  twenty  to  thirty  degrees 
below  ze-io  on  the  western  shore  of  the  lake  seldom  fall  to  zero  on  its  Michigan 
border. 

The  amount  of  heat  which  a  gallon  of  water  will  absorb  and  then  give  off  again 
when  surrounded  by  a  lower  temperature  is  immense.  Take  a  gallon  of  water, 
heat  it  to  the  boiling  point,  put  it  in  a  common  jug,  and  place  it  under  the  robes 
in  a  sleigh,  and  it  will  keep  the  feet  comfortably  warm  for  a  whole  day's  journey 
with  the  thermometer  at  zero.  Such  is  precisely  the  effect  of  Lake  Michigan,  less 
in  degree  but  infinitely  greater  in  amount.  Warmed  up  by  the  summer's  heat  of 
sun  and  wind,  as  the  air  over  the  water  falls  below  it  in  temperature,  the  water 
yields  up  a  portion  of  its  heat  in  constantly  ascending  vapor  which  these  westei.'y 
winds  bring  directly  to  the  Michigan  shore,  softening  almost  past  credibility  its 
climate  as  far  'north  as  the  forty-fifth  parallel.  In  this  respect  the  great  lake  seems 
almost  endowed  with  consciousness;  the  colder  the  weather  the  greater  its  effort 
to  temper  the  air.  Go  out  in  a  still  clear  morning  with  the  thermometer  at  zero 
and  look  out  upon  the  lake;  you  will  see  a  dense  column  of  vapor  rising  from  its 
surface,  as  though  all  the  fires  of  Pluto  were»seething  at  its  bottom.  This  vapor  is 
wafted  over  the  land  and  meeting  with  the  colder  upper  air  is  condensed  and  falls 
in  snowfiakes  so  clean  and  pure  and  white  that  nature  furnishes  no  object  with 
which  to  compare  them.  This  evaporation  is  going  on  constantly  during  the  winter 
season,  giving  a  great  depth  of  snow,  particularly  in  the  northern  portion,  where 
the  depth  is  so  great  that  the  ground  is  wholly  protected  from  freezing. 

The  same  causes  that  temper  the  winter,  acting  inversely,  also  temper  the  heat 
of  summer.  The  water  having  cooled  down  to  near  the  freezing  point  during  the 
winter,  absorbs  the  excessive  heat  of  summer,  so  that  those  blighting  winds  which 
so  often  sear  and  destroy  the  foliage  of  trees  and  plants  in  other  states  are  unfelt 
in  this. 

While  the  hydrographic  advantages  of  Michigan  regulate  and  temper  its  general 
climate,  its  favorable  tojjography  is  a  valuable  element  in  successful  orcharding. 
Along  the  whole  eastern  shore  of  Lake  Michigan,  for  at  least  ten  miles  inland, 
and  around  Gi"and  Traverse  bay,  for  a  distance  varying  from  three  to  five  miles, 
damaging  frosts  either  in  spring  or  fall  sel&lt;lom  occur,  and  the  same  is  true  upon  the 
hillsides  and  ridges  of  the  rolling  lands  of  the   interior.     The  philosophy  of  this  is 


42  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 


.so  simple  and  yet  so  little  understood  that  an  explanation  here  will  not  be  out  of 
place. 

Every  one  has  observed  that  ordinary  frosts  vary  greatly  in  their  severity  in  the 
same  neighborhood,  low  places,  level  lands,  and  basins  or  depressions,  suffering 
more  injury  than  sidehills,  knolls  and  ridges.  On  a  clear,  still  night  beat  radiates 
from  the  surface  of  the  earth  into  space.  As  this  radiation  goes  on  the  surface 
glows  colder  and  colder.  If  level  the  air  remains  stationary  and  falls  in  temperature 
with  the  surface  of  the  earth.  At  first  the  moisture  of  the  air  is  condensed  and 
forms  dew;  at  32°  Fahrenheit  it  is  crystalized  into  hoar  frost;  if  it  sinks  still  lower  the 
Srip  of  tender  plants  is  frozen,  and  expanding  bursts  or  injures  the  cells  and  kills  the 
plants.  Cold  air  is  heavier  than  warm  air,  and  the  colder  it  gets  the  heavier  it 
grows.  On  hillsides,  knolls  and  ridges,  as  radiation  cools  the  surface  the  air  becomes 
hoavier  and  runs  down  the  hill  to  the  valley  or  plain  below  and  warmer  air  takes 
its  j)lace;  this  in  its  turn  grows  dense  and  passes  down,  forming  a  current  of  air 
down  the  hill,  leaving  none  of  it  still  long  enough  to  reach  the  freezing  point.  If 
the  valley  is  inclosed  so  as  to  form  a  basin,  the  cold  air  draining  into  it  may  fill 
it  up  so  that  the  frost  will  reach  up  the  hillside  to  the  level  of  the  dam  which 
incloses  it.  But  where  the  drainage  reaches  a  body  of  water,  heat  escaping  from 
the  water  reheats  the  air,  causing  it  to  rise  and  flow  back  again  to  take  the  place 
of  that  which  is  flowing  down  the  hill.  In  the  cold,  still  nights  of  winter  the  dif- 
ference in  temperature  between  hillsides  and  inclosed  basins  and  level  land  is 
surprising. 

On  February  9,  1865,  the  coldest  night  ever  known  in  the  Grand  Traverse  region, 
Messrs.  Avery  and  Marshall  of  Old  Mission  found  a  difference  of  twenty-two  degrees 
in  less  than  100  feet  elevation;  and  Messrs.  Parmely  &amp;  Brinkman  eleven  degrees  in 
fourteen  feet  elevation.  These  tests  were,  however,  in  places  where  the  drainage  was 
obstructed  by  ridges  across  the  line  of  drainage  forming  basins.  Where  the  valley 
or  hillside  opens  without  obstruction  to  the  bay  or  lakes,  the  difference  is  not  so  great. 
I  found  on  my  farm  which  descends  rapidly  towards  Grand  Traverse  bay,  a  differ- 
ence of  ten  degrees  to  one  hundred  feet  elevation  on  the  same  night  of  the  Old 
Mission  test. 

When  we  consider  how  close  the  margin  is  between  absolute  exemption  from 
injury  and  the  total  destruction  of  the  tender  varieties  of  fruit  trees  by  freezing, 
we  can  see  how  important  is  this  matter  of  atmospheric  drainage.  With  twelve 
degrees  peach  buds  are  comparatively  safe;  at  fifteen  degrees  the  buds  are  pretty 
sure  to  be  killed,  and  th«  trees  are  in  danger;  and  at  twenty-two  degrees  destruc- 
tion of  the  tree  is  almost  certain.  A  hundred  feet  elevation,  with  open  drainage 
to  lower  levels,  may  determine  the  difference  between  a  crop  of  fruit  and  a  ruined 
orchard;  and  in  inclosed  valleys  or  basins  twenty  feet  may  do  the  same. 

This  simple  matter  was  not  understood  in  the  early  planting  of  orchards  in  this 
State.  For  ease  of  cultivation  and  convenience  in  gathering  the  fruit,  level  lands 
were  selected  for  orcharding,  to  the  great  disappointment  and  loss  of  the  owners. 

MARKETS. 

A  glance  at  the  map  of  Michigan  and  the  west  is  all  that  is  necessary  to  show 
its  great  advantage  in  respect  to  markets.  At  the  very  gates  of  Chicago,  the 
greatest  distributing  fruit  point  in  the  world,  with  both  water  and  rail  transports- 


Michigan   as   a   Fruit   Growing    State.  43 

tiou  to  the  vast  fruitless  region  of  the  west  and  north  with  its  unlimited 
demand,  gives  to  Michigan  fruit  growers  market  advantages  superior  to  the  fruit 
growers  of   any  other  state. 

CHARACTER   OF    FRUIT. 

The  fruits  grown  in  Michigan,  while  less  in  size  than  the  same  varieties  grown 
in  the  Mississippi  valley  and  on  the  Pacific  coast,  are  firmer  in  texture,  more  spirited 
and  pronounced  in  flavor,  higher  colored,  fairer,  and  of  greater  specific  gravity,  and 
their  keeping  qualities,  especially  apples,  surpass  all  other  districts.  My  peach 
orchard  is  on  Grand  Traverse  bay,  elevated  100  feet  above  its  surface,  in  latitude 
ii°  iii  .  I  had  a  heavy  crop  last  summer,  and  today,  March  21, 1893,  notwithstanding 
the  severity  of  the  past  winter,  the  buds  are  uninjured  and  the  promise  for  a  heavy 
crop  again  this  year  is  certain.- 


PEPPERMINT  AND  OTHER  ESSENTIAL  OILS. 


BY  GEO.  W.  OSBORN,  OF  MENDON,  PRESIDENT  OF  THE  CENTRAL  MINT  GROWERS' 
CO-OPERATIVE   ASSOCIATION. 


Michigan  produces  annually  more  peppermint  oil  than  all  the  other  states  com- 
bined, and  St.  Joseph  county,  in  which  it  was  first  successfully  produced  com- 
mercially in  this  State,  still  furnishes  something  more  than  half  of  Michigan's 
annual  product.  Next  in  order  of  their  product  come  Kalamazoo,  Wayne,  Van 
Buren,  Allegan  and  Cass,  and  peppermint  is  raised  and  stilled  to  a  small  extent 
in  several   other   counties. 

Peppermint  was  first  cultivated  and  distilled  in  Michigan  in  about  183o,  on 
White  Pigeon  Prairie,  township  of  Florence,  St.  Joseph  county,  by  a  Mr.  Sawyer, 
but  for  some  reason  the  venture  was  unprofitable  and  was  abandoned.  Pepper- 
mint oil  was  first  successfully  produced  commercially  in  1842,  by  Messrs.  John 
Smith  and  Harrison  Ranney,  who  had  had  experience  in  the  business  in  Wayne 
countj',  N.  Y.,  on  the  farm  of  the  late  Norman  Roys,  in  the  same  township  of 
Florence.  The  sandy  loam  of  the  burr  oak  plains  seemed  particularly  adapted 
to  its  growth.  That  farm  and  township  were  soon  covered,  the  business  extended 
to  the  townships  of  Lockport,  Nottawa,  Park  and  Mendon,  so  that  by  1850  the 
yearly  product  of  peppermint  in  St.  Joseph  county  alone  was  estimated  at 
100,000  to  150,000  pounds — an  amount  exceeding  the  production  of  all  the  rest  of 
the  world  at  that  time.  These  details  for  the  early  history  of  this  industry  I 
get  from  Mr.  George  Roys,  who  was  born  in  Florence  and  is  thoroughly  famil- 
iar with  it,  and  though,  at  this  distance  in  time  and  in  the  absence  of  statis- 
tics, the  estimate  may  seem  wild,  it  must  be  remembered  that  at  that  time  the 
land  was  new,  injury  by  winter  freezing  or  summer  drouth  practically  unknown, 
and  that  the  average  yield  was  about  twenty  pounds  per  acre  on  uplands,  whereas 
at   present   a  very  small   proportion  of   the  crop   is  grown   on   uplands.      The   big 


Peppermint  and  other  Essential  Oils.  45 

crop  of  1850  also  so  overloaded  the  market  that  the  price  of  oil  dropped  to  less 
than   one   dollar   a   pound,   driving  many  out   of   the   business. 

Although  it  was  known  that  peppermint  was  a  plant  of  an  aquatic  nature,  it 
was  not  until  1880  that  it  was  demonstrated  that  it  could  be  successfully  pro- 
duced on  reclaimed  marsh  land.  This  induced  Messrs.  Sidney  Johnson  and  Henry 
Hall,  of  Three  Rivers,  to  buy  and  reclaim  1,000  acres  of  the  "Florence  marsh" 
for  this  purpose,  on  which  Mr.  Hall  still  successfully  operates  the  largest  mint 
farm   in   the   world. 

Marsh  mint,  however,  is  not  free  from  failures.  Cut  worms,  spring  frosts,  sum- 
mer floods  and  grasshoppers  serve  to  keep  the  supply  even  with  the  demand. 
Though  an  average  successful  crop  is  fifteen  to  twenty  pounds  of  oil  per  acre,  yet 
owing  to  reasons  given  fields  are  often  cut  yielding  only  two  to  four  or  five  pounds, 
and  frequently  as  high  as  one-fifth  of  the  acreage  in  the  State  reported  to  the 
Mint  Growers'  Association  is  an  entire  loss,  so  this  keeps  the  average  per  acre  for 
the  State  low  as  compared  with  the  average  per  acre  for  a  fairly  good  crop.  As 
the  mint  is  only  cultivated  the  first  year  and  requires  afterward  no  expense  of 
labor  except  cutting  with  a  mower  and  distilling,  fields  are  often  harvested  which 
yield   little  more   than   enough  to  pay  for   mowing   and   distilling. 

WORMWOOD,   SPEARMINT,   ETC. 

Wormwood  was  first  cultivated  and  distilled  in  Michigan  in  18C0,  by  the  late 
Alvin  Calhoun,  likewise  of  Florence,  St.  Joseph  county,  who  was  the  only  grower 
for  several  years.  In  1871  he  sold  150  pounds  of  oil  at  twelve  dollars  per  pound, 
and  the  exorbitant  price  so  stimulated  over  production  that  the  price  dropped 
to  about  two  dollars;  too  near   the   cost  to   leave  any   profit  to  the  grower. 

The  other  essential  oils  grown  and  distilled  by  farmers  are  spearmint,  tansy 
and  erigeron.  All  theee  oils  are  produced  in  sufficient  quantities  to  supply  the 
demand,  and  their  annual  sales  add  several  thousand  dollars  to  the  essential  oil 
industry. 

ACREAGE    IN    PEPPERMINT. 

The  number  of  acres  of  peppermint  now  raised  in  the  State  from  a  close  esti- 
mate made  by  the  Mint  Growers'  Association,  is  about  11,000.  The  average  yield 
per  acre  is  about  8  pounds,  making  a  total  of  88,000  pounds.  The  average  price 
paid  growers  for  the  past  four  or  five  years  has  been  $2  per  pound.  Total 
value  to  growers,  $176,000.  The  oil  is  sold  by  the  producers  to  local  buyers,  who 
sell  it  to  exporters  and  speculators  in  New  York  and  other  markets,  except  what 
is  handled  by  the  Mint  Growers'  Association  and  sold  direct  to  the  large  dealers 
in  New  York  and  elsewhere  for  the  benefit  of  its  members.  Michigan's  only  con- 
siderable domestic  competitor  in  peppermint  oil  is  the  State  of  New  York,  where 
the   indvistry    first   started. 

MODE   or   DISTILLATION. 

As  a  rule  the  farmers  distill  their  own  mint,  except  the  small  growers,  who 
draw  it  to  the  nearest  still  to  be  manufactured.  These  stills  are  generally  run 
night  and   day  until   the  crop  is  secured.    The  oil  is  obtained   by  evaporation,  the 


46  Michigan   and  its  Eesources. 

Bteam  passing  through  a  series  of  tin  pipes,  where  it  is  condensed  by  using  cold 
water  upon  them.  The  water  and  oil  thus  condensed  runs  into  a  receiver;  the 
oil  being  the  lighter  rises  to  the  top  and  is  dipped  off  into  cans  and  is  ready 
for   market. 

EXPORTS   OF   ESSENTIAL   OILS. 

The  exports  of  peppermint  oil  from  the  United  States  for  a  number  of  years 
past,  so  as  to  get  an  average  cannot  be  obtained,  for  the  reason  that  previous  lo 
the  year  ending  June  30,  1891,  this  oil  was  classed  in  exports  with  other  essential 
oils  and  drugs.  In  1890  the  association  succeeded  in  getting  peppermint  in  a  sepa- 
rate list,  and  the  annual  statement  of  the  exports  of  the  United  States  for  the 
year   ending  June  30,   1891,   shows  in   pounds   as  follows:

Great   Britain  and   Ireland 15.326 

France 4,513 

All  other  countries 291 

Total   amount   exports  (pounds) 45,321 

Total   export  value.... $120,831 

Average  value  exports,  per  pound $2  66 


FOREIGN   COMFETITION. 

A  small  amount  of  peppermint  oil  is  produced  in  England,  Germany  and  Frauc&lt;^, 
but  not  enough  to  affect  prices  in  the  world's  markets. 

The  most  serious  competition  we  have  to  meet  is  from  an  inferior  oil  produced 
in  Japan.  This  oil  has  an  unpleasant  odor  and  taste,  but  is  a  heavy  oil  and  rich 
in  menthol.  The  following  table  of  exports  from  Japan  from  1884  to  1890,  with 
the  export  value  at  the  date  of  shipment  will  show  the  competition  from  that 
country:

This  oil  was  sent  to  the  following  countries:  Germany,  Great  Britain,  China, 
France,  United  States,  Italy,  British  India,  and  other  countries  in  the  order 
named. 

It  will  be  seen  that  Japanese  oil  enters  largely  into  the  world's  consumption 
and  is  a  strong  competitor  of  American  oils.  Its  cheapness,  and  the  facility  with 
which  it  can  be  mixed  with  our  oil  as  an  adulterant,  makes  it  a  dangerous 
rival. 


MICHIGAN   AT  THE  FAIR. 


BY   WORLD  S   FAIR   COMMISSIONER. 


AT  THE  FORE  IN  THESE  GREAT  INDUSTRIES: 

First  in  Lumber,  Iron  Ore,  Charcoal,  Iron,  Salt,  Gypsum,  Furniture,  Fruit, 
Peppermint  Oil,  Inland  Fisheries,  Lake  Commerce,  Ship  Building;  Second 
IN  Copper  and  Vessel  Tonnage  of  all  Kinds.  First  also  in  Yield  of 
Wheat  Per  Acre  and  Value.     Product  Per  Acre  op  the  Main  Farm  Crops. 

A  summary  of  statistics  regarding  Michigan's  chief  industries,  compiled  under 
direction  of  the  State  World's  Fair  Commissioners  for  bulletin  in  the  Michigan 
building,  makes  a  remarkable,  and  in  some  respects  a  showing  as  surprising  as  it 
is  gratifying  in  respect  to  those  industries  in  which  the  Peninsula  State  either 
leads  all  other  states  in  the  Union,  or  stands  in  the  front  rank  in  the  extent  and 
value  of  annual   product. 

By  this  exhibit,  compiled  in  most  cases  from  official  sources,  Michigan  stands  ftrst 
in  lumber  and  saw-mill  products,  hardwood  forests,  hai-dwood  manufactures  and  furni- 
ture. First  in  iron  ore,  charcoal  iron,  salt  and  gypsum.  Second  in  copper.  Among 
the  first  in  yield  of  wheat  per  acre  and  in  the  value  product  per  acre  of  farm  crops 
generally  as  compared  with  states  west  of  New  York.  First  in  peppermint  oil,  and 
not  second  in  apples,  peaches,  plums  and  fruit  generally.  Third  in  value  of  sheep 
and  wool,  only  Ohio  and  California  surpassing  her.  First  in  extent  of  coast  line,  with 
over  1,600  miles  on  Lakes  Superior,  Michigan,  Huron,  St.  Clair  and  Erie.  First  in 
inland  commerce;  first  in  inland  commercial  fisheries;  first  in  ship  building,  and 
second  only  to  New  York  in  vessel  tonnage  of  all  kinds.  First  in  number  and 
variety  of  its  summer  resorts,  and  in  its  wealth  of  brook  trout,  grayling,  bass, 
pike,  perch,  and  other  stream  and  lake  sport  fishing.  First  in  its  State  univer- 
sity, with  2,800  students  (science,  literature,  law  and  medicine);  and  not  second  in

its  common,  high,  normal  and  mining  schools  and  agricultural  college;  or  in  its 
State  benevolent  institutions,  including  school  tor  the  blind  at  Lansing;  for  deaf 
mutes  at  Flint,  soldiers'  home  at  Grand  Rapids.  State  public  school  at  Coldwater. 
industrial  home  for  girls  at  Adrian,  industrial  school  for  boys  at  Lansing,  asylums 
for  insane  at  Kalamazoo,  Pontiac,  Traverse  City  and  upper  peninsula,  asylum  for 
insane   criminals    at    Ionia,  and  home  for  the  feeble-minded. 

Some  of  these  statements  are  almost  startling.  For  instance,  nearly  half  the  total 
domestic  product  of  iron  ore  and  half  its  value  come  from  Michigan's  mines.  Pro- 
duct for  1892,  7,543,544  tons;  increase  over  1890  census  of  1,687,375  tons.  (Report 
statistics  geological  survey  for  1892.)  Total  value  of  product  of  United  States  for 
census  year,  $a3..3.51.978;  total  tons,  14,518,041,  of  which  Michigan  produced  5,85G,- 
169,  valued  at  $15,800,524;  Alabama  next  in  tonnage  with  1,570,319  tons,  valued  at 
$1,511,621;  New  York  second  in  value  product,  $3,100,216,  with  1,247,5.37  tons;  Penn- 
sylvania third  in  value  product,  $3,063,514.  with  1,560,2,34  tons.  Average  value  per 
ton  of  ore,  Michigan,  $2.70;  Alabama,  $0.96;  New  York,  $2.49;  Pennsylvania,  $1.96. 
(Census  bulletin  113). 

"  The  total  production  of  iron  ore  in  the  United  States  in  1890,"  says  State  Com- 
missioner of  Mineral  Statistics  Lawton  in  his  official  report,  "was  about  17)^4  mill- 
ion tons,  to  which  Michigan  contributed  7,185,175  tons,  worth  at  the  mines  at  least 
$26,000,000.  The  quality  of  Michigan  ore  is  greatly  in  its  favor.  The  average  in  1890 
was  02  per  cent,  in  metallic  iron  some  68,  while  much  of  the  ore  produced  else- 
where has  but  50  per  cent  or  less.  About  half  of  the  product,  too,  was  Bessemer, 
i.  e.,  so  free  from  phosphorus  as  te  be  suitable  for  making  Bessemer  steel." 

"Nearly  55  per  cent  of  all  the  iron  ore  mined  in  the  United  States  in  1892  was 
furnished  by  the  Lake  Superior  region,  and  of  this  amount  Michigan  furnished  86 
per  cent." — Richard  A.  Parker. 

The  report  of  the  mining  division  of  statistics  in  the  geological  survey  for  1892 
puts  the  total  iron  ore  product  for  the  United  States  for  1892  at  16,296,666 
long  tons,  or  1,778,625  tons  increase  over  census  year.  Michigan  produced  in  1892, 
7,543,544  tons,  an  increase  over  census  year  of  1,687.375,  or  95  per  cent  of  the 
increase  for  the  whole  country,  and  over  46  per  cent  of  the  total  output.  Ala- 
bama stands  next  to  Michigan  in  output  with  2,312,071  tons;  Minnesota  third, 
with  1,255,463;  Pennsylvania  fourth,  1.084,047;  New  York  fifth,  891,099;  Wisconsin 
sixth,  790.179  tons.  Twenty-four  states  produced  iron  ore  in  commercial  quantities. 
With  only  43^^  per  cent  of  the  total  output  in  the  census  year  Michigan's  value 
l&gt;roduct  was  47 1^  per  cent.  vVith  46  per  cent  of  the  total  output  in  1892,  as  per 
report  of  geological  survey,  the  value  product  of  Michigan  iron  ores  for  '92  should 
be  a  trifle  over  50  per  cent  of  the  total  value  product;  and  with  47.3  per  cent  of 
the  total  output,  as  per  R.  A.  Parker's  figures,  51.4  per  cent  of  the  total  value 
product. 

Michigan,  Wisconsin  and  Minnesota  produce,  according  to  1890  census,  more 
than  one-third  of  all  the  lumber  in  the  United  States,  while  Michigan's  output 
just  about  equals  that  of  Wisconsin  and  Minnesota  combined,  and  was  a  fifth 
(to  be  exact,  19.75  per  cent)  of  the  total  domestic  product.  The  total  Michigan 
product  of  lumber,  shingles,  staves,  etc.,  for  the  census  year  aggregated  $68,141,189, 
an  increase  over  1880  of  $15,691,261.    United  States  census  bulletin  No.  5,  page  6,

The  acting  superintendent  of  census  under  date  of  May  5,  1893,  states  that  it 
was  '■  not  yet  possible  to  publish  final  and  complete  totals,  but  that  Michigan's 
prodvict  constituted  nearly  one-fifth  (19.73  per  cent)  of  the  total  value  of  lumber 
and  sawmill  products  thus  far  obtained  for  the  census  of  1890."  He,  however, 
gives  a  summary,  by  groups  of  states,  of  the  lumber  and  sawmill  products  (exclu- 
sive of   manufactures)  as  follows: 

White  pine  group  (Michigan,  Wisconsin,  Minnesota) $115,699,014: 

Pacific  coast  (California,  Washington,  Oregon) 24,192,367 

Hard   pine    states  (Maryland,  Virginia,  North  Carolina,  South   Carolina, 
Georgia,  Florida,  Alabama,  Mississippi,  Louisiana.  Texas,  Arkansas, 

Missouri) 54,747,266 

Central   (Ohio,  Indiana,  West   Virginia,  Kentucky,  Tennessee) 49,433,293 

Eastern  (Maine,  New  Hampshire,  Vermont,  Massachusetts,  Rhode  Island, 

Connecticut,  New  York,  New  Jersey.  Pennsylvania,  Delaware) 62,087,984 

All  the  other  states  and  territories 4,119,246 

Total   for  United  States $323,134,009 


The  total  United  States  lumber  and  sawmill  products  (according  to  same  author- 
ity) for  1880  were  $233,660,04.3,  or  $89,474,052  less  than  in  1890,  while  Michigan, 
Wisconsin  and  Minnesota  produced  in  1880,  $77,768,313,  or  $37,930,691  less  than  in 
1890.  In  1880  these  three  states  furnished  33.34  per  cent  of  the  total  United  States 
lumber  and  sawmill  product,  while  in  1890  they  furnished  .35.81  per  cent.  The 
Pacific  group  furnished  7.49  per  cent;  the  southern,  16.94  per  cent;  the  central,  15.29 
per  cent;   the  eastern,  19.21  per  cent;  all  other  states  and   territories,  5.26  per  cent. 

The  United  States  produces  half  of  the  world's  copper,  and  Michigan  one-third 
that  of  the  United  States.  Michigan's  1889  product,  43,728  tons;  1890,  50,3033^ 
tons;  1891,  54,685  tons.  "  The  total  value  of  Michigan's  1890  copper  output,  at  15^4 
cents  per  pound  (average  rate  for  year  in  New  York)  was  15,855,427."  (Report  of 
Michigan  Commissioner  of  Mines  and  Minerals,  1891,  page  .36.)  Total  United 
States  product  in  1889,  113,028  tons;  Michigan,  43,728  tons;  Montana,  49,111.  Total 
for  1890,  136,704  tons;  Michigan,  50.303i^  tons;  Montana,  61.475.  Michigan  1891 
[iroduct,   54.685  tons.

50  Michigan   and  its  Eesoukces. 

According  to  1890  census  Michigan  produced  one-third  the  charcoal  iron  made 
in  the   country,   $3,932,278  out  of   the   $11,985,103  total  domestic   product. 

In  salt  Michigan's  output  is  almost  one-half  in  amount  and  value  of  the  total 
domestic  product;  $2,302,579  in  value  in  1890;  in  1891,  3,927,671  barrels;  in  1892. 
3,812,054  barrels. 

Of  gypsum  Michigan  produces  almost  half  the  total  domestic  product— 131,767 
tons  in   1890;  New  York   next   with  52,206  tons. 

For  an  average  of  ten  years  ending  in  1890,  as  shown  by  report  of  United 
States  Statistician  Dodge.  Michigan  not  only  led  Ohio,  Indiana,  Illinois,  and  all 
the  great  northwestern  wheat  states  in  the  yield  of  wheat  per  acre  (18J^  bushels 
in  1891  as  per  Michigan  "Farm  Statistics"),  but  also  in  the  value  product  per 
acre  of  wheat,  corn,  oats,   bai'ley,  buckwheat   and   hay. 

Michigan  has  178  furniture  factories  in  60  cities  and  villages,  with  an  invested 
capital  of  $9,855,000.  Grand  Rapids  has  45  factories,  with  a  capital  of  $5,000,000. 
employing  5,000  hands  and   is   the   recognized  furniture    center  of   the  country. 

More  peppermint  oil  is  produced  in  Michigan  than  in  all  the  rest  of  the  country 
together.  The  acreage  for  1892  is  put  at  11.000;  average  yield  per  acre,  eight 
pounds;  value  per  pound  at  still,  $2.00,  or  a  total  value  in  first  hands  of  $176,000. 
In  1890-91  the  United  States  exported  45,.321  pounds  of  oil,  valued  at  $2.66  per 
pound,  while  Japan,  the  only  other  country  producing  a  surplus  of  peppermint, 
exported  same  year  39,149  pounds,  valued  at  eighty-five  cents.  The  Japan  article 
is  a  heavy  oil  and  rich  in  menthol,  but  in  every  other  way  inferior  and  is  largely 
in   use  as  an   adulterant. 

But  probably  the  most  surprising  figures  are  those  grouped  under  the  head- 
ing, "First  in  inland  commerce,  first  in  ship  building,  and  second  only  to  New 
York  in  vessel  tonnage  of  all  kinds."  According  to  the  quoted  report  of  United 
States  Statistician  Dodge,  the  total  vessel  tonnage  on  the  Great  Lakes  in  1891 
was  1,063,063  tons;  number  of  vessels,  2,94');  value.  $75,590,950.  The  ton  mileage 
on  these  lakes  in  same  year  was  25  per  cent  of  the  railway  ton  mileage  of  the 
United  States.  The  freight  tonnage  passing  the  Sault  canal  in  1890  was  8,554,- 
4.34,  or  1,664,341  tons  more  than  passed  through  Suez  canal,  and  this  although 
the  Suez  is  open  the  whole  year,  while  the  Sauit  is  closed  several  months.  The 
freight  tonnage  passing  through  Detroit  river  in  1890  was  21,684,000  tons,  about 
the  same  as  that  of  Liverpool  and  London  combined,  or  our  entire  Atlantic  coast 
foreign  trade  tonnage.  The  character  of  the  lake  tonnage  is  given  as  follows: 
Steamers,  1,277;  sail,  927;  unrigged,  771;  steel,  89;  iron,  .39;  wood,  2,817.  Statis- 
tician Dodge  is  quoted  further  on  this  point  as  follows:  "About  one-quarter  the 
tonnage  of  our  entire  merchant  marine  is  on  the  northern  lakes,  and  the  large 
steam  tonnage  (1,000  tons  and  upwards)  on  the  Great  Lakes  exceeds  the  total 
similar  tonnage  of  all  the  rest  of  the  country  by  131.093  tons."'  Michigan  leads 
in  this  great  lake  commerce  and  her  vessel  tonnage  for  the  year  ending  June 
30,  1892,  exceeded  that  of  every  other  state  in  the  Union,  except  New  York,  the 
great  ocean  carrier.  The  figures  on  which  this  statement  is  based  are  furnished 
by  the  United  States  statistician  from  the  last  report  of  the  United  States  bureau 
of  navigation.  The  table  following  shows  the  number  of  vessels  and  vessel  ton- 
nage of  the  sixteen   leading  states  (totaling   4,373,040   tons  in  1892)   for   the  years

From  the  foregoing  table  it  is  seen  that  the  growth  of  Michigan's  tonnage  has 
been  continuous  since  1886,  and  that  its  increase  in  six  years  has  been  73  per 
cent.  New  Yoi'k's  tonnage,  for  the  same  period  shows  a  net  increase  of  only  10 
per  cent:  its  tonnage  showing  a  steady  decrease  amounting  to  15^3  per  cent  for 
the  five  years  ending  1891.  and  then  in  a  single  year  jumping  up  310.704  tons. 
Massachusetts  shows  a  net  decrease  since  1886  of  52.401  tons,  or  about  12  per 
cent;  Maine  a  decrease  of  i;35.000  tons,  or  '21%  per  cent.  The  seven  Atlantic  sea- 
board states.  New  York.  Massachusetts,  Pennsylvania.  Maine,  Maryland,  Connecti- 
cut and  New  Jersey,  which  in  1892  had  considerably  more  than  half  the  total 
tonnage  of  the  country,  showed  in  that  j'ear  a  net  increase  over  1886  of  only 
39,078  tons,  or  1%  V^^'  cent,  while  the  tonnage  of  the  lake  states,  Michigan,  Ohio. 
Wisconsin,  Illinois,  Indiana  and  Minnesota,  increased  during  the  same  period 
;5^39,406  tons,  or  60  per  cent.  315,774  tons  being  credited  to  Michigan  and  Ohio. 
The  lake  tonnage  of  New  York  and  Pennsylvania  has  not  as  yet  been  given  sepa- 
rately from   the  ocean  tonnage. 

Not  less  surprising  is  the  way  Michigan  has  forged  to  the  front  in  ship  building. 
Of  the  total  294,123  vessel  tonnage  built  in  1890  in  the  United  States  169,091  tons 
were  built  on  the  seaboard,  16.560  tons  on  western  rivers,  and  108,526  tons  on  the 
northern  lakes.  Of  this  108.526  lake  tonnage  Michigan  yards  at  Bay  City,  Detroit 
and  Grand  Haven  built  45,7.33  tons,  65  vessels,  including  two  4,000  ton  steel 
steamers  for  the  ocean  trade,  while  Cleveland  and  other  Ohio  yards  built  41,000  tons. 
United  States  Statistician  Dodge,  who  is  authority  for  the  foregoing,  further  says: 
"  The  steam  tonnage  built  on  the  Great  Lakes  in  1890  was  40  per  cent  greater  than 
that  of  the  entire  seaboard.  For  the  lakes,  86,023  tons;  seaboard,  61,137."  It  may 
not  be  amiss,  in  this  connection,  to  add  that  but  for  the  treaty  with  Great  Britain, 
which  forbade  it,  some  of  the  great  war  cruisers  for  the  United  States  navy  would 
have  been  constructed  at  the  Bay  City  yards. 

As  indicative  of  Michigan's  yet  undeveloped,  as  compared  with  developed 
resources,  farming  and  othei',  the  following  figures  are  also  given:  Population  in 
1890,   2,09.3,889;    increase    over    1880,   28    per   cent.    Tax    value,    State    equalization, 


52  Michigan  and  its  Eesourcem. 

1892,  $1,130,000,000;  squai-e  miles,  per  United  States  survey,  58,915.  Acres  of  land 
in  farms  as  per  "  Michigan  Farm  Statistics"  of  1893,  12,720,019.  Acres  land  not  in 
farms,  24,254,741.  Acres  in  farms  improved,  8,328,189;  not  improved,  including 
reserved  woodlands,  4,392,430.  Considering  the  large  proportion  of  Michigan's 
yet  undeveloped  resources  in  connection  with  what  she  has  already  achieved,  her 
inexhaustible  mines  and  minerals,  her  wealth  in  hard  wood  forests  lying  conven- 
ient to  consuming  centers,  her  advantageous  position  as  the  center  of  the  com- 
merce of  the  Great  Lakes,  and  the  great  amount  of  virgin  agricultural  land  yet 
untouched  by  the  settler,  it  must  be  conceded  that  no  state  in  the  Union  offers 
brighter  promise  for  the  future. 

Michigan  is  a  great  State.  She  is  surpassed  by  no  other  state  in  the  Union,  if 
indeed  equaled,  in  the  extent,  number  and  diverstiy  of  the  great  industries  in 
which  she  either  leads  or  stands  in  the  front  rank;  and  this  fact  will  be  made 
more  and  more  prominent  as  the  days  roll  by  at  the  great  World's  Fair  in 
Chicago. 


THE   UPPER   PENINSULA. 


BY   HON.    J.    M.    LONGYEAR. 


The  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan,  lying  between  Lake  Superior  on  the  north  and 
Lakes  Michigan  and  Huron  on  the  south,  and  adjoining  the  state  of  Wisconsin  on 
the  southwest,  is  something  over  three  hundred  miles  in  length  and  nearly  one 
hundred  and  fifty  miles  in  extreme  width.  Its  average  width  is  perhaps  fifty  or 
sixty  miles,  its  irregular  outlines  making  it  extremely  difficult  to  give  any  compre- 
hensive verbal  description  of  it.  In  surface  characteristics  it  presents  more  variety 
than  is  found  in  any  other  part  of  the  State.  The  eastern  half  of  the  peninsula  is 
comparatively  level,  being  underlaid  on  the  south  by  horizontally  bedded  limestones 
and  on  the  north  by  sandstone.  In  this  part  of  the  peninsula  occur  very  extensive 
swamps,  some  of  which  are  heavily  timbered  with  spruce,  cedar,  tamarack,  etc., 
while  others  consist  of  extensive  wet  marshes  or  savannas.  There  are  also  large 
areas  of  land  in  this  region  with  rolling  and,  in  places,  broken  surface,  particularly 
on  the  north  or  Lake  Superior  shore  where  sandstone  often  rises  to  heights  of  sev- 
eral hundred  feet  above  the  lake,  notably  at  the  Pictured  Rocks,  where  the  rugged 
scenery,  the  fantastic  and  beautiful  forms  into  which  the  waters  of  the  lake  has 
worn  the  sandstone,  create  a  coast  whose  beauties  have  been  famous  since  the 
country  was  first  known  to  the  earliest  explorers.  The  streams  in  this  region 
generally  flow  southward  into  Lake  Michigan,  the  watershed,  or  divide,  being  only 
a  few  miles  south  of  Lake  Superior.  The  Teh-qua-me-non  river  is  the  largest 
which  enters  Lake  Superior  from  the  eastern  half  of  the  peninsula,  the  other 
streams  being  generally  small.  The  streams  flowing  into  Lake  Michigan  are  slug- 
gish and  of  considerable  volume,  considering  the  area  drained.  Those  entering 
Lake  Superior  are  generally  of  rapid  current  and  many  of  them  form  interesting 
and   picturesque  waterfalls   in   their   rapid   descent   to   the   lake. 

The  surface  of  the  western  part  of  the  peninsula  is  generally  rolling  and  often 
broken  with  high,  rocky  hills  rising  to  heights  of  from  six  hundred  to  one  thousand 


54  Michigan  and   its  Resources. 


live  hundred  feet  above  Lake  Superior.  The  most  rugged  and  mountainous  regions 
are  the  Huron  mountains,  east  of  Keweenaw  bay,  and  the  Porcupine  mount- 
ains, near  the  west  end  of  the  peninsula.  The  streams  in  this  portion  of  the 
peninsula  are  generally  full  of  rapids  and  contain  numerous  cataracts,  some  of 
which  have  already  been  utilized  for  water-jjower.  Many  others  will  be  utilized  in 
the  future,  as  the  natural  power,  aggregating  many  thousand  horse  power,  will 
certainly  be  used  as  the  region  is  developed.  Most  of  the  streams  in  this  west- 
ern portion  of  the  peninsula  are  small,  but  a  few  carry  a  very  considerable  vol- 
ume of  water  and  the  power  they  are  able  to  furnish  will  be  permanent  and 
valuable. 

Scattered  about  over  the  surface  of  the  entire  peninsula  are  hundreds  of  lakes 
of  various  sizes,  from  mere  ponds  to  several  thousand  acres  in  area.  Pish  abound 
in  nearly  all  of  these  lakes  and  many  of  them  are  visited  every  year  by  sports- 
men, the  number  of  visitors  steadily  increasing  from  year  to  year  as  better  trans- 
portation  facilities  are   afforded. 

The  region  is  an  enticing  one  to  the  tourist,  tlie  sportsman,  the  artist  and 
the  man  of  business,  all  finding  within  its  boundaries  ample  scope  for  the  exer- 
cise  of   their   respective   talents   and   skill. 

IKON   ORE.  I 

The  great  business  of  the  upper  peninsula  is  the  production  of  iron  ore,  in 
which  the  western  half  abounds.  It  is  safe  to  say.  however,  that  great  as  the 
production  now  is,  the  capacity  of  the  peninsula  is  many  times  greater  than  has 
yet  been  demonstrated.  The  greater  part  of  the  peninsula  is  still  a  wilderness 
and  there  are  miles  of  iron  ore  indications  yet  untouched  by  miners  or  explor- 
ers. Many  of  these  indications  are  fully  as  good  as  those  first  found  on  the 
older  ranges.  The  iron  ore  business  of  the  peninsula  multiplied  over  seven  times 
in  the  eighteen  years  between  1873  and  1890,  both  seasons  inclusive,  and  it  is 
safe  to  say  that  it  may  be  still  multiplied  seven  times  more  before  the  limit  of 
its  productive  capacity  has  been  reached.  It  is  estimated  by  many  experts  that 
in  the  not  very  distant  future  the  iron  business  of  this  country  will  have 
increased  to  such  porportions  that  it  will  be  impossible  to  supply  the  quality  of 
ore  now  being  furnished  and  that  it  will  be  necessary  to  mine  and  smelt  the 
so  called  lean  ores.  When  that  time  comes  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan  will 
b«  able  to  supply  many  billions  of  tons  of  such  ores,  which  ai'e  at  present 
ignored   by   the  miner. 

IRON   MANUFACTURING. 

Thus  far  the  manufacture  of  iron  in  Michigan  has  been  practically  confined 
to  furnaces  usintf  charcoal  for  fuel.  It  is,  however,  now  confidently  asserted  by 
experts,  who  have  carefully  studied  the  subject,  that  it  is  perfectly  feasible  to 
manufacture  iron,  using  coke  as  fuel,  at  Lake  Superior  points  and  this  industry 
will  probably  be  added  to  those  of  the  upper  peninsula  in  the  near  future.  Char- 
coal ii'on  for  special  purposes  will  undoubtedly  continue  to  be  made  in  the  upper 
peninsula  for  many  years  to  come  and  the  thousands  of  miles  of  hardwood  for- 
ests  in   this  part  of   the   State  offer   superb   facilities  for  obtaining   such   fuel. 


The    Upper   Peninsula.  55 


COPPER. 

The  euormous  productions  of  native  copper  from  Lake  Superior  mines  are 
almost  entirely  the  output  of  about  half  a  dozen  mines,  the  Calumet  and  Hecla 
producing  more  than  half  the  entire  output.  The  working  mines  are  all  situated 
on  Keweenaw  Point.  The  copper  range,  however,  extends  from  the  extremity  of 
Keweenaw  Point  southwesterly,  running  nearly  parallel  to  the  shore  of  Lake  Supe- 
rior, to  the  State  line,  a  distance  of  about  one  hundred  and  twenty-five  miles, 
of  varying  width,  but  the  copper  bearing  formation  is  usually  several  miles  wide. 
Probably  not  more  than  forty  miles  of  this  territory  have  been  prospected  and 
much  of  that  but  imperfectly.  The  possibilities  of  copper  production  in  Michigan 
are  beyond  calculation. 

In  addition  to  the  formations  carrying  native  copper  on  the  Keweenaw  Penin- 
sula there  are,  in  various  parts  of  the  iron  and  copper  regions,  known  veins  of 
copper  ore  (gray  sulphurets,  etc.).  These  veins,  however,  have  had  practically  no 
attention,  although  some  of  them  are  doubtless  well  worth  examination,  and  search 
would   reveal   many  more. 

LUMBER. 

The  pine  lumbering  industry  of  the  upper  peninsula  has  developed  very  rapidly 
within  the  past  few  years  and  is  now  of  very  considerable  volume.  At  present 
this  industry  is  confined  almost  entirely  to  the  manufacture  of  pine,  although 
some  cedar  is  cut.  The  hardwoods  are  also  receiving  some  attention,  but  practi- 
cally the  forest  wealth  of  the  upper  peninsula,  excepting  pine,  may  be  said  to 
be  untouched  and  undoubtedly  the  lumber  business  in  this  region  has  a  great 
future    before   it. 

GOLD. 

The  existence  of  deposits  of  gold-bearing  veins  have  been  known  for  years  and 
one  company  has  operated  a  mine  and  stamp  mill  for  several  years.  Not  enough 
work,  however,  has  been  done  in  the  gold  deposits  to  speak  very  positively,  as 
yet,  of  their  value,  but  considerable  i-ock  of  fabulous  richness  has  been  discov- 
ered by  the  explorers.  The  gold-bearing  region  is  generally  a  wilderness  and  but 
very  little  known.  A  few  explorers  have  investigated  it  somewhat  and  report  the 
existence  of  gold-bearing  quartz  veins,  placer  deposits,  and  also  some  tellurium. 
The  future  undoubtedly  will  have  some  interesting  developments  for  the  State 
in   this   direction. 

SILVER. 

More  or  less  silver  has  always  been  found  in  the  copper  mines  and  some  years 
ago  considerable  exploring  was  done  in  Ontonagon  county  on  veins  which  carried 
more  or  less  native  silver.  No  thorough  test  of  this  region,  however,  was  made 
and  the  experiments  resulted  in  no  practical  demonstration  either  of  the  richness 
or  poverty  of  the  lodes."  The  formation  in  which  this  silver  was  found  appears 
to  be  nearly  as  extensive  as  the  trap  range,  on  the  northwesterly  side  of  which 
it   is  found.     Wherever  it  was  found   silver   was  present.    The  few  openings  made 


56  Michigan   and  its  Resources. 

covered  many  miles  on   the   length  of   the  formation   and   it   is  not   at  all   unlikely 
that  veins  of  sufficient   richness  for   profitable   working   will   be   found. 

Veins  carrying  galena  have  been  discovered  in  various  parts  of  the  peninsula. 
but  thus  far  have  had  very   little   attention. 

SLATES. 

Ridges  of  slate  are  of  rather  frequent  occurrence  and  many  of  them  contain 
material  suitable  for  roofing  slates.  Some  attempts  have  been  made  to  quarry 
these  slates  for  the  market,  and  although  slate  of  magnificent  quality  was  pro- 
duced, the  enterprises,  for  some  reason,  did  not  appear  to  be  profitable.  There 
has,  however,  been  but  one  persistent  attempt  made  at  slate  quarrying  and  it  is 
likely  that  future  efforts  in  this  line  may  be  more  satisfactory  to  the  operators. 
There  are  certainly  many  attractive  looking  deposits  of  slate  and  some  of  them 
will   undoubtedly   prove   desirable   for  quarrying  purposes. 

Excellent  pressed  brick  have  been  made  from  pulverized  slate  chips  and  this 
industry,  added  to  the  quarrying  business,  would  likely  make  the  waste  product 
of  the  quarries  profitable. 

At  many  points  and  running  with  the  slate  have  been  found  beds  of  graphite, 
but  as  yet  no  developments  have  been  made  in  this  direction  and  no  thorough 
prospecting. 

SANDSTONE. 

About  four  hundred  miles  of  the  Lake  Superior  coast  of  the  upper  peninsula 
is  composed  of  sandstone.  It  forms  cliffs  at  many  points  on  the  lake  from  a  few 
feet  to  several  hundred  feet  in  height.  The  formation  generally  extends  inland 
for  several  miles.  Several  very  profitable  quarries  of  building  sandstone  have 
already  been  opened.  There  is  a  vast  field  for  exploring  and  development  of  this 
industry.  The  stone  produced  from  the  quarries  is  of  unsurpassed  quality  for 
building  purposes.  The  colors  are  white,  re.i,  brown  and  variegated,  the  varie- 
gated being  the  least   valuable   and  the  most   common. 

GRANITE. 

There  are  vast  areas  of  so-called  granite  rocks  in  the  upper  peninsula,  the 
greatest  development  of  which  are  in  the  Huron  Mountain  region,  although  it  is 
of  frequent  occurrence  in  all  the  counties  in  the  west  half  of  the  peninsula. 
Practically  no  exploration  for  building  stone  has  been  done  among  the  granites 
and,  while  it  is  supposed  that  granite  exists  of  quality  suitable  for  building 
material,  it  has  not  yet  been  demonstrated. 

MICA. 

Mica  has  been  found  in  sufficiently  large  samples  to  lead  to  the  expectation 
that  workable  deposits  of  this  valuable  mineral  will  be  found  in  the  upper 
peninsula. 

MARBLE. 

In  Marquette  county  a  range  of  serpentine  exists  from  which  specimens  of 
various  shades  of  green,   veined    with   white    and    red   in    almost   infinite   variety, 


The  Upper  Peninsula.  57 

have  been  produced  as  samples,  but  no  quarrying  on  a  commercial  scale  has  yet 
been  done.  The  few  specimens  which  have  been  polished  are  very  beautiful  and 
a  brilliant  future  undoubtedly   awaits  this  industry. 

Dolomite  is  also  known  to  exist  in  extensive  beds.  It  is  generally  white,  but 
in  places  indications  of  pink  and  light  green  shades  have  been  noticed.  This  is 
a  marble  of  which  great  quantities  are  used  for  building  purposes,  being  put  to 
both  exterior  and  interior  uses.  The  upper  peninsula  dolomite  is  entirely  unde- 
veloped. By  burning  it  is  said  to  produce  a  magnificent  quick  lime  and  has 
been  used  in  plastering  buildings   near  outcrops,  giving   great   satisfaction. 

LIMESTONE. 

The  extensive  area  in  the  upper  peninsula  underlaid  with  limestone  is  but  little 
known,  except  on  the  coast  where  there  are  many  ledges  suitable  for  building 
purposes.  In  many  places  the  action  of  the  elements  on  these  coast  ledges  has 
produced  very  picturesque  scenic  effects.  Several  thousand  square  miles  of  lime- 
stone will  contribute  greatly  to  the  business  prosperity  of  this  region  in  the  future. 
A  few  small  lime  kilns  at  various  points  are  now  manufacturing  quick  lime  and 
near  the  Straits  of  Mackinaw  several  deposits  of  gypsum  have  been   discovered. 

TIMBEE. 

At  least  four-fifths  of  the  entire  area  of  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan  is 
now  timbered  with  pine,  white  cedar,  hemlock,  sugar  maple,  soft  maple,  black, 
yellow  and  white  birch,  basswood,  spruce,  tamarack,  poplar,  fir  and  other  varieties 
of  timber.  Pine  and  white  cedar  are  already  extensively  cut,  much  of  it  being 
manufactured  in  the  district.  Large  quantities  are  also  shipped  out  of  the  dis- 
trict in  rough  shape  to  be  manufactured  elsewhere.  A  limited  quantity  of  maple, 
birch,  etc.,  is  also  cut.  Considerable  spruce  and  white  poplar  are  cut  and  used 
in  the  manufacture  of  paper.  Hemlock  is  used  somewhat  for  lumber,  but  more 
for  mining  timber.  Michigan  is  now  the  greatest  producer  of  merchantable  wood 
of  any  State  in  the  Union,  but  with  the  exception  of  pine  the  timber  reserves 
of  the  upper  peninsula  are  practically  untouched;  an  immense  and  promising  field 
for  future   business. 

CLAYS. 

In  some  parts  of  the  peninsula  extensive  beds  of  clay  are  known,  but  they 
have  as  yet  had  little  attention.  There  are  a  few  small  brick  yards  in  various 
parts  of  the  district,  but  the  most  promising  clay  beds  have  thus  far  been  neg- 
lected. There  are  clays  in  the  southwestern  part  of  Houghton  county  from  which 
samples  have  been  burned,  producing  a  very  rich  chocolate  colored  brick  of  supe- 
rior texture.  A  bed  of  kaolinite  is  known  in  Ontonagon  county,  which  has  had 
a  little  attention.  It  is  now  owned  by  a  pottery  company  in  another  State  and 
is  operated  only  to  furnish  a  limited  amount  of  material  for  special  uses.  Other 
beds  of   this  material   would  undoubtedly   be  revealed  by   prospecting. 

A  bed  of  clay  in  Marquette  county  shows  by  analyses  a  composition  somewhat 
similar  to  that  of  pozzualana,  the  famous  Roman  hydraulic  cement.  Clay  from 
this  bed  has  also  been  used  for   cheap  paint,  giving  excellent  satisfaction.    This 


58  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

bed  is  also  unworked.  Clays  from  the  Chocolate  river  valley  have  been  made 
into  cheap  pottery,   producing  a  yellow  ware  of  superior  quality. 

It  is  altogether  likely  that  exploration  would  reveal  beds  of  clay  suitable  for 
fine  pottery  and  perhaps  for  porcelain.  The  decomposition  of  the  laurentian  rocks, 
of  which  immense  areas  are  found  in  the  upper  peninsula,  is  likely  to  produce 
such  material. 

It  is  believed  that  there  are  materials  in  various  parts  of  the  peninsula  suitable 
for  the  manufacture  of  hydraulic  cement,  but  little  or  no  attention  has  been  paid 
to  the  discovery   of  such  material.  , 

FERTILIZERS. 

Beds  of  marl,  or  diatomaceous  earth,  are  known  in  several  localities  and  explora- 
tion would  undoubtedly  reveal  a  great  many  such  deposits.  This  is  another  unde- 
veloped source  of  wealth  in  the  upper  peninsula,  which  will  undoubtedly  receive 
attention  in  the  future. 

PEAT. 

Beds  of  peat  are  known  to  exist  in  various  localities  and,  about  1870,  a  small 
iron  furnace  was  constructed  at  Ishpeming,  in  which  peat  was  used  for  fuel  in 
smelting  iron  ore.  The  fuel  was  satisfactory,  but  the  cost  of  labor  at  that  time 
prevented  the  enterprise  from  becoming  a   commercial   success. 

Some  of  the  other  undeveloped  resources  of  the  upper  peninsula  are  novaculite, 
of  which  several  beds  are  known,  and  many  years  ago  a  partially  successful  attempt 
was  made  to  work  one  of  them,  but  the  expense  of  doing  the  business  under 
many  disadvantageous  conditions  prevented  its  becoming  a  successful  enterprise. 
The  whetstones,  or  hones,  produced  were  of  very  fine  quality  and  commanded  a 
high  price  in  the  market. 

Beds  of  quartzite,  suitable  for  use  as  ganister  have  been  worked  to  a  limited 
extent  and  these  beds  are  capable  of  producing  an  almost  unlimited  quantity  of 
this  material. 

Sand  suitable  for  glass  making  appears,  in  extensive  deposits,  near  Grand  Island. 

Asbestos  is  also  known  in  various  localities,  but  no  attempt  has  yet  been  made 
to  utilize  it. 

AGRICULTURE. 

Perhaps  in  its  soil  the  upper  peninsula  has  the  greatest,  certainly  the  most 
enduring,  of  its  undeveloped  sources  of  wealth.  Cultivation  of  the  soil  has  had 
comparatively  little  attention  in  this  district,  but  the  number  of  farms  and  the  cul- 
tivated area  is  steadily  increasing.  Fine  crops  are  raised  and  an  extensive  home 
market  with  good  prices  is  sure  to  produce  an  important  development  in  this 
direction.  All  of  the  cereals,  excepting  Indian  corn,  are  successfully  raised,  pro- 
ducing large  crops,  and  the  grain  is  of  superior  quality.  Hay  is  quite  extensively 
produced  and  is  an  easy  and  sure  crop.  All  root  crops,  such  as  potatoes,  beets, 
turnips,  garden  vegetables,  etc.,  yield  liberally  and  are  of  very  superior  quality.  Many 
people  from  this  and  other  states  who  are  acquainted  with  the  quality  of  upper 
peninsula  potatoes  annually  provide  themselves,  if  possible,  with  "Lake  Superior 


The  Upper  Peninsula.  59 


potatoes."  Sugar  beets  have  been  expei-imented  with  somewhat  and  the  reports 
of  the  agricultural  department  show  that  upper  peninsula  beets  are  superior  in 
yield,  both  as  to  quantity  and  quality,  to  any  others  raised  in  the  State.  Field  peas 
have  also  proved  a  very  satisfactory  crop.  Muck  soils  found  in  the  upper  penin- 
sula have  been  found  especially  adapted  to  the  growth  of  celery  and  this  industry 
is  rapidly  becoming  an  extensive  one  in  the  vicinity  of  Newberry.  This  plant  is 
successfully  raised  in  all  parts  of  the  peninsula  of  a  quality  which  has  no  superior. 

Small  fruits,  such  as  strawberries,  raspberries,  whortleberries,  cranberries,  etc., 
grow  in  a  wild  state,  yielding  abundantly,  and  the  tame  varieties  thrive  unusually 
well  under  cultivation.  Orchard  fruits  are  also  satisfactorily  grown.  Apples,  pears, 
plums,  cherries,  crab-apples,  etc.,  are  successfully  raised.  Plums  and  cherries  yield 
very  abundantly. 

Destructive  insects,  worms,  etc.,  in  other  regions  the  pest  of  the  farmer,  are  but 
little  known   here. 

Stock  raising  has  received  little  attention  but  the  few  experiments  which  have 
been  made  demonstrate  that  it  is  perfectly  feasible,  and  it  is  claimed  that  cattle 
raised  in  this  region  for  food,  yield  meat  of  superior  quality  and  flavor.  The  use 
of  silos  will  undoubtely  enable  the  Lake  Superior  stock  raiser  of  the  future  to 
compete  successfully  with  the  cattle  dealei's  of  more  southern  latitudes.  It  has 
long  been  the  subject  of  comment  that  imported  cattle,  arriving  here  in  poor 
condition,  rapidly  take  on  flesh  by  grazing  upon  the  native  grasses,  no  other 
food  seeming  to  be  required  to  produce   almost  marvelous  results  in  this  direction. 

The  most  successful  farmers  in  this  region  appear  to  be  people  from  the  north 
of  Euiope,  where  the  same  climatic  conditions  are  found.  Many  of  these  people 
who  arrived  here  only  a  few  years  ago,  without  means,  have  already  achieved  a 
competence.  Their  success  brings  others  and  the  region  is  slowly  becoming  popu- 
lated with  a  hardy,  energetic,  honest,  thrifty  people.  The  class  of  immigrants 
who  engage  in  this  industry  are  usually  of  the  best  and  become  good  citizens 
and   valuable  acquisitions  to  the   commonwealth. 

Tftie  soils  of  the  upper  peninsula  are  almost  infinite  in  variety,  ranging  from 
light  sand  through  loam  of  various  qualities  to  heavy,  stiff  clays.  Much  of  the 
sandy  soil  has  a  clay  sub-soil,  rendering  it  very  desirable  for  cultivation.  Exten- 
sive tracts  of  muck  are  also  found,  being  especially  suited  to  the  raising  of 
celery,   etc. 

TRANSPORTATION. 

In  the  matter  of  transportation  the  upper  peninsula  is  exceptionally  well  situ- 
ated. Nearly  twenty  harbors  give  access  to  the  water  transportation  system  of 
the  great  lakes,  from  which  its  products  may  be  floated  to  the  harbors  of  seven 
of  the  best  states  in  the  Union  and  the  dominion  of  Canada.  Four  of  the  great 
railway  sj'stems  of  the  country  are  represented  in  the  peninsula  and  two  others 
reach  its  borders.  These  facilities  insure  the  best  possible  rates  to  the  most  desir- 
able markets. 

The  situation  of  the  upper  peninsula,  lying  between  Lakes  Michigan  and  Supe- 
rior, and  forming  a  great  central  highway  through  which  the  rapidly  growing 
traffic  between  the  great  western  states  and  the  Atlantic  seaboard  must  pass, 
make  it   certain    that    in    the   near    future    several    trunk    lines  of   railroad   must 


60  Michigan  and  its  Eesoukces. 

traverse  this  region  throughout  its  entire  length.  Two  such  systems  have  already 
been  constructed  and  others  are  projected.  A  glance  at  a  map  of  the  United  States 
will  show  that  the  natural  course  for  the  traffic  between  the  east  and  the  west 
of  the  northern  part  of  the  United  States  and  the  southern  part  of  Canada  is 
by  way  of  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan.  Its  geographical  position  alone  would 
insure  a  great  development  of  all  its  resources.  Its  population  has  more  than 
doubled  during  each  of  the  past  two  decades  and  this  increase  is  composed  of 
active,  energetic,  pushing  citizens.  It  is  certain  that  a  region  so  situated,  so  pop- 
ulated and   abounding   in  great   natural   resources   must  have  a  glorious  future. 

Many  wagon  roads  have  already  been  built  in  this  region,  but  many  more  and 
better  roads  are  imperatively  necessary  to  its  best  development,  and,  while  this 
is  perhaps  not  the  best  place  to  advocate  the  measure,  it  seems  proper  to  sug- 
gest that  the  unemployed  prisoners  in  the  various  state  prisons  might  be 
employed  with  great  profit  to  the  commonwealth,  and  without  interfering  with 
the  much  discussed  rights  of  honest  labor,  in  constructing  wagon  roads  in  both 
peninsulas. 

CLIMATE. 

The  climate  of  the  upper  peninsula  is  colder  than  that  of  regions  further  south, 
but  the  atmosphere  is  clear,  bracing  and  invigorating.  Malaria  is  practically 
unknown  and  its  people  are  hardy,  healthy  and  alert.  The  region  has  long  been 
a  Mecca  for  a  steadily  increasing  number  of  invalids  from  less  favored  regions, 
who  here  find  relief  from  hay  fever,  asthma,  bronchial  and  pulmonary  troubles. 
Lying  within  five  hundred  miles  of  the  center  of  population  of  the  United  States, 
the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan  is  bound  to  become  a  great  summer  resort,  as, 
indeed,  it  already  is.  Inducements  offered  to  the  invalid,  pleasure  seeker,  artist 
and  the  sportsman  annually  bring  thousands  of  people  from  other  states  to  enjoy 
its  superb  climate. 


UPPER   PENINSULA   RESOURCES. 


BY     E.   A.    PARKEK,    C.    E. 


GEOGRAPHICAL. 


When  the  classic  city  ou  the  Tiber  was  at  the  zenith  of  her  power  she  was 
the  geographical  center  as  well  as  the  seat  of  government  of  a  vast  empire,  the 
remotest  parts  of  which  were  accessible  by  a  magnificent  system  of  highways. 
Though  it  was  not  strictly  true  that  all  roads  led  to  Rome,  yet  the  exaggera- 
tion was  so  little  wude  of  the  truth  and  at  the  same  time  so  tersely  descriptive 
of  the  method  by  which  the  regnant  city  kept  in  close  touch  with  all  her  depend- 
encies, that  it  passed  unchallenged,  and  that  "all  roads  led  to  Rome"  was 
universally  accepted  as  a  fact.  At  any  rate,  the  geographies  of  the  day  located 
all  places  with  reference  to  the  then  mistress  of  the  world,  and  the  guide-boards 
or  whatever  served  their  purpose,  told  the  traveler  that  in  such  a  direction  and 
in   so   many   days'  journey  lay  Rome. 

The  year  1893  affords  a  modern  instance  of  a  similar  condition,  so  that  the 
present  moment  it  holds  figuratively  and  literally  true  that  all  roads  lead  to  the 
World's  Fair.  Chicago  is  the  center  of  civilization  for  the  time  being;  the  Rome 
of  a  broader  and  nobler  empire;  a  Rome  which  has  achieved  and  maintained 
supremacy  by  the  arts  of  peace;  whose  walls  are  the  enterprise  and  patriotism 
of  her  people;  whose  conquering  armies  are  the  intellectual,  industrial  and 
commercial   classes. 

The  mining  districts  of  Michigan  must  necessarily  attract  many  from  among 
the  hosts  who  visit  this  country  and  the  Vi'orld's  Fair  this  year,  and  to  them 
these  pages  modestly  essay  to  serve  as  a  guide.  The  meridian  of  Chicago  trav- 
erses the  very  heart  of  the  iron  district  of  Michigan.  The  palace  of  mines  and 
mining  in  Jackson  park  is  on  an  exact  north  and  south  line  with  the  iron 
mines  of  Ishpeming  and   Negaunee.

TEANSPORTATION. 

Three  great  railway  systems,  the  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern,  Chicago,  Milwaukee  &amp; 
St.  Paul  and  the  Wisconsin  Central,  reach  northward  from  Chicago  along  the  line 
of  this  meridian  and  bring  all  parts  of  the  mining  district  within  twelve  to  fifteen 
hours  ride  from  the  western  metropolis.  Hugging  the  same  meridian  a  maritime 
route  takes  the  tourist  in  one  day  from  Chicago  to  the  greatest  iron  port  of  the 
world,  Escanaba,  adding  all  the  comforts  of  steamship  accommodations  to  the 
delights  of  travel  and  without  for  a  moment  quitting  sight  of  the  shore  panorama  of 
undulating  hills,  verdant  forests,  smiling  meadows  and  busy  cities.  A  three  days' 
prolongation  of  this  voyage  will  culminate  at  the  head  of  Lake  Superior,  after  the 
voyager  has  passed  through  the  wonderful  St.  Mary's  canal  and  entered  every  port 
where  can  be  heard  the  noisy  rumble  of  the  crude  ores  as  they  plunge  from  bins 
high  in  air  through  iron  troughs  aud  into  the  holds  of  great  vessels  for  transporta- 
tion to  the  furnaces  of  the  east. 

Another  great  trunk  system,  the  Canadian  Pacific,  gives  a  direct  connection  with 
the  Atlantic  seaboard  and  the  agricultural  northwest.  This  line  is  also  paralleled  by 
a  maritime  route  of  unsurpassed  beauty  and  grandeur,  and  traversing  the  entire 
chain  of  the  great  lakes  except  Lake  Michigan. 

Such  is  the  peculiarly  advantageous  geographical  situation  of  the  upper  penin- 
sula of  Michigan,  a  rough  scalene  triangle  of  about  20,000  square  miles  area, 
with  the  angles  marked  by  Menominee,  Sault  Ste.  Marie  and  the  mouth  of  the 
Montreal  river. 

TIMBER. 

Timber  is  almost  the  sole  natural  resource  of  the  eastern  half  of  the  peninsula. 
The  western  half  is  equally  rich  in  forests  of  pine  and  hardwoods,  while  in  the 
central  portion  it  possesses  treasures  in  its  mines  of  iron,  copper  and  gold,  and 
quarries  of  sandstone  and  marble.  In  time  the  great  clay  and  kaoline  beds  will  be 
immensely  valuable.    Slate  is  abundant  and  graphite  is  known  to  exist. 

CLIMATE. 

The  climate  knows  neither  extreme  heat  nor  cold,  thanks  to  the  equalizing  influ- 
ence of  the  adjacent  great  lakes,  though  the  district  lies  between  the  parallels  of 
forty-five  degrees  and  thirty  minutes  and  forty-seven  degrees  and  thirty  minutes 
north  latitude.  The  air  is  pure  and  invigorating.  The  water  of  Lake  Superior  is 
remarkable,  not  only  for  its  purity,  but  its  average  temperature,  being  about 
forty-six  degrees  Fahrenheit.  The  streams  afford  ample  power  and  supply  for 
every  purpose.  The  Dead  river,  near  Marquette,  being  harnessed  to  a  motor,  fur- 
nishes electric  light  for  municipal  and  household  purposes. 

The  population  of  150,000  souls  is  heterogeneous,  owing  to  the  comparative  new- 
ness of  the  district  and  the  vicissitudes  of  mining.  But  in  no  mining  district  in 
the  world  is  there  a  population  of  better  average  intelligence  and  education. 

HISTORICAL. 

In  the  history  of  early  exploration  and  discovery,  there  is  a  peculiar  fascina- 
tion, and  it  is  especially  so  with   regard   to    the  famed   Lake   Superior  regions   of 


Upper  Peninsula  Kesources.  63 

northern  Michigan,  a  territory  which  half  a  century  ago  was  marked  on  the  map 
as  the  "unexplored  country  lying  north  of  the  straits  of  Mackinaw,"  but  which  is 
now  the  greatest  iron  producing  region  in  the  world,  and  has  within  its  borders  the 
Calumet  &amp;  Hecla  copper  mine,  one  of  the  largest  copper  producers  in  the  world,  and 
the  only  one  in  which  that  metal  is  found  in  a  pure  state. 

It  is  the  purpose  of  this  article  to  review  not  so  much  the  wonderful  development 
•  of  the  northern  peninsula  of  Michigan,  a  peninsula  nearly  encircled  with  the  great- 
est lakes  in  the  world  (Lake  Superior  on  the  north,  with  its  water  clear  as  crystal, 
and  pure  as  a  living  spring,  fringed  by  some  of  the  most  magnificent  scenery  in 
nature,  with  Lake  Michigan  and  Green  bay  delightfully  situated  on  the  south),  as 
to  narrate  a  few  of  the  facts  and  incidents  concerning  the  discovery  of  this  mineral 
wealth,  the  efforts  of  its  pioneers  for  its  development,  and  the  settlement  of  this 
unknown  region. 

In  1844  the  lauds  in  this  northern  peninsula  of  Michigan  had  been  partly  sur- 
veyed into  townships,  but  not  subdivided  into  sections.  The  government  surveyors 
engaged  in  dividing  this  territory  into  townships  during  that  year  carried  to  the 
east  reports  that  it  contained  evidence  of  valuable  mineral  deposits,  and  some  of 
these  reports  were  of  a  glowing  character,  as  is  usually  the  case  where  the  rich 
minerals  of  mother  earth  are  either  known  or  supposed  to  exist. 

This  was  about  the  time  similar  reports  were  sent  from  the  gold  fields  of  Cali- 
fornia, which  carried  flocks  of  people  to  the  Pacific  coast  and  caused  many  to  leave 
their  bones  bleaching  upon  the  plains  in  the  unsuccessful  effort  to  reach  the  goal 
of  their  hopes. 

These  reports  with  regard  to  the  copper  and  iron  region  reached  the  early  citizens 
and  settlers  of  Jackson,  Michigan,  which  was  then  a  small  inland  town,  in  the  then 
sparsely  settled  lower  peninsula,  and  during  the  long  winter  of  1844  and  1845,  when 
there  was  little  for  the  inhabitants  of  that  enterprising  village  to  busy  themselves 
about,  they  canvassed  the  probabilities  of  the  future  wealth  of  the  northern  penin- 
sula, and  the  more  they  canvassed  that  subject  and  speculated  upon  the  probabilities, 
the  brighter  the  visions  of  easily  and  rapidly  accumulated  wealth  appeared,  and  these 
visions  became  a  settled  conviction  in  their  minds  that  a  fortune  of  no  small  pro- 
portions awaited  them  in  this  unexplored  region,  if  they  would  but  "go  out  and 
possess  it." 

Guided  by  these  convictions,  eleven  residents  of  Jackson  and  one  of  Detroit,  includ- 
ing Col.  A.  V.  Berry,  Frederick  W.  Kirkland  and  Philo  M.  Everett,  formed  an  asso- 
ciation called  the  "Jackson  Mining  Company,"  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  and 
prosecuting  the  business  of  mining,  in  the  mineral  district  so  called  on  the  south 
shore  of  Lake  Superior,  and  for  the  purpose  of  smelting  the  ore  of  copper  and  other 
minerals  to  be  obtained  from  said  lands. 

These  enterprising  men  sent  out  exploring  parties  to  this  new  and  undeveloped 
region  during  the  year  1845.  They  journeyed  north  by  a  small  steamboat,  that 
made  occasional  trips  as  far  as  the  rapids  of  Sault  Ste.  Marie  and  from  there  by 
Indian  canoes  coasted  along  the  south  shore  of  Lake  Superior  to  the  north  of  Dead 
river,  a  stream  emptying  into  Marquette  bay,  and  now  in  the  limits  of  the  present 
flourishing  city  of  Marquette.  At  Sault  Ste.  Marie  they  met  Marji  Gesick,  a  sub- 
chief  of  the  Chippewa  tribe  of  Indians,  a  shrewd,  bright  king  of  the  forest,  who 
possessed  none  of  the  accomplishments  of  polite  society,  but  was  well  acquainted 
with  every  river  and  stream    flowing  into  Lake  Superior,   and  every  bay  and  inlet 


64  Michigan  and  its  Resouroes. 

along  its  grand  and  beautiful  shore.  These  pioneers  from  Jackson,  while  at  Sault 
Ste.  Marie,  succeeded  in  inducing  Marji  Gesick  to  guide  them  to  the  iron  regions  now- 
lying  in  Marquette  county,  in  this  northern  peninsula;  and  landing  at  the  mouth  of 
Dead  river,  following  this  Indian  guide  through  the  woods,  they  were  taken  to  a  high 
hill  sloping  to  the  north,  and  at  its  base  and  along  the  side  of  the  hill  there  was  an 
outcrop  of  the  finest  quality  of  gray  granular  iron  ore  that  stood  out  to  view  like 
a  quarry  of  granite;  and  at  the  foot  of  this  hill  and  near  this  iron  was  a  large, 
massive  pine  tree,  about  four  feet  in  diameter,  standing  in  the  midst  of  a  forest  of 
hard  wood. 

As  the  government  had  not  surveyed  these  lands,  and  they  were  not  in  market, 
this  territory ,could  not  be  purchased  by  these  pioneers,  but  Congress  had  passed  an 
act  that  where  mineral  territory  was  discovered  on  the  lands  of  the  government,  the 
discoverer  might  obtain  a  mining  right  by  applying  to  the  war  department,  describing 
the  territory  as  best  he  could,  and  receive  from  the  department  a  certificate  known 
as  a  "  permit  to  mine,"  with  an  agreement  upon  the  part  of  the  government  that, 
under  certain  conditions,  when  the  land  should  be  surveyed,  the  government  would 
lease  the  territory  to  the  party  holding  such  permit. 

Under  these  provisions  of  congress  a  mile  square  might  thus  be  selected,  and 
in  order  to  designate  the  territory  including  this  wonderful  deposit  of  iron  ore, 
these  explorers  marked  this  stately  pine  on  two  sides,  putting  their  specific  marks 
•of  designation  on  the  tree,  and  considered  that  tree  the  center  of  a  mile  square; 
and  the  year  following,  Col.  Berry  and  F.  W.  Kirtlarid,  both  surveyors,  taking  that 
pine  tree  as  the  center  of  the  section,  marked  out  the  boundary  of  the  mile  square 
thus  designated  by  blazed  lines,  and  thus  was  located  what  has  been  known  dur- 
ing  half    a  century  as  the  "Jackson  Mine  of  Lake  Superior." 

As  a  reward  for  his  services,  Marji  Gesick  received  from  the  Jackson  Mining  Com- 
pany the  following  certificate: 

"  River  Du  Mort,  Lake  Superior,  May  30th,  1846.— This  may  certify,  that  in  con- 
sideration of  the  services  rendered  by  Marji  Gesick,  a  Chippewa  Indian,  in  hunt- 
ing ores  of  location  No.  593,  of  the  Jackson  Mining  Company,  that  he  is 
entitled  to  twelve  undivided  thirty-one  hundredth  parts  of  the  interest  of  said 
mining  company  in  said  location  No.  593.  A.  V.  Berry,  President;  F.  W.  Kirt- 
land,  Secretary." 

This  paper  Marji  Gesick  kept  in  a  little  box  of  birch  bark  in  his  wigwam, 
and  when  he  went  upon  fishing  excursions  in  his  canoe,  carried  this  little  box 
with  him  in  the  bottom  of  his  canoe.  He  died  at  an  old  age  in  his  canoe,  and 
in  this  canoe  this  box  was  found  by  his  daughter  Charlotte,  the  wife  of  Charles 
Kobogum,  now  chief  of  the  remnants  of  the  Chippewa  tribe  in  this  northern 
country,  who  has  adopted  the  habits  of  civilization  and  lives  in  a  beautiful  park 
in  the  outskirts  of  the  city  of  Marquette,  on  Presque  Isle  Point,  where  he  is 
the  overseer  and  protector  of  its  natural  growth  of  trees,  consisting  of  pines,  bal- 
sam, fir,  cedar,  white  birch,  maple,  beech  and  native  shrubbery. 

Charles  Kobogum  is  over  eighty  years  of  age  and  is  as  straight  as  an  arrow, 
six  feet  in  height,  with  massive  head  and  a  brain  that  would  have  made  him  a 
warrior  of  distinction  in  his  tribe  in  its  warlike  days,  or,  if  reared  in  civilization, 
a  commanding  figure  in  public  life.  His  wife  Charlotte,  now  totally  blind,  is  also 
a  specimen  of  the  native  intelligence  and  kindly  disposition  of  the  aborigines  when 
not  goaded  to  revenge  by  outrageous  treatment.     Charles  and  his  wife  are  now

largely  supported  by  the  proceeds  of  a  judgment  collected  against  the  Jackson  Iron 
Company,  based  upon  the  above  certificate  received  from  the  predecessor  of  the 
present  company. 

The  records  of  the  Jackson  Iron  Company  showed,  upon  the  trial  of  the  suit 
brought  against  the  company  for  enforcement  of  the  right  of  the  heirs  of  Marji 
Gesick,  that  up  to  1884  that  company  had  realized  in  dividends  and  surplus 
about  nine  million  dollars  from  this  iron  hill,  thus  discovered  to  the  pioneers  in 
question  by  Marji  Gesick.  It  is  just  to  say  that  these  early  pioneers  who  dis- 
covered this  mine  never  questioned  the  justice  of  Marji  Gesick's  right  and  were 
not  responsible  for  the  necessity  of  a  lawsuit  to  recover  them.  This  rich  prop- 
erty passed  from  their  control  at  an  early  date.  The  struggle  to  develop  it  upon 
this  northern  shore  involved  such  expense,  and  the  difficulty  of  bringing  the 
product  to  market  at  that  time  was  such  that  the  members  of  the  pioneer  asso- 
ciation lost  their  stock  largely  by  oppressive  assessments  and  the  property  passed 
into  the  hands  of  eastern  capitalists,  who  refused  to  recognize  the  rights  of  dis- 
covery due  to  Marji  Gesick  until  the  supreme  court  of  Michigan  pronounced  fav- 
orably  upon  the  justice   of   the   claim. 

The  Jackson  mine  is  located  about  thirteen  miles  from  the  shore  of  Lake 
Superior,  by  the  traveled  route  from  Marquette,  and  though  the  ore  was  dis- 
covered in  1845  no  shipments  for  market  were  made  until  1856,  as  there  were 
no   means  of  transportation  until   that   time. 

While  the  people  of  Jackson,  Michigan,  were  being  awakened  to  the  mineral  wealth 
of  this  northern  country,  the  people  in  old  Massachusetts  were  also  canvassing, 
not  only  the  wealth  of  the  gold  fields  of  California,  but  also  the  mineral  resources 
of  this  northern  region,  and  at  Worcester,  in  that  state,  an  association  was  also 
formed  consisting  of  Amos  R.  Harlow,  Waterman  A.  Fisher,  Robert  J.  Graveraet 
and  Edwin  Clark,  to  make  explorations  and  locations  similar  to  those  proposed 
and  made  by  the  Jackson  parties,  and  Mr.  Harlow,  as  the  first  agent  of  that  asso- 
ciation, landed  at  the  mouth  of  Carp  river  on  July  G,  1849,  having  coasted  from 
Sault  Ste.  Marie  in  an  Indian  canoe,  leaving  his  wife  and  family  at  Sault  Ste. 
Marie,  to  follow  him.  The  purpose  of  this  association  w^as  not  only  to  locate 
iron,  but  to  smelt  it,  and  certain  government  leases  were  procured  by  this  company 
covering  the  territory  now  known  as  the  mine  of  the  Lake  Superior  Iron  Com- 
pany, then  under  the  name  of  the  "  Briggs  lease,"  and  also  the  Cleveland  mine,  also 
held  under  what  was  known  as  the  "Moody  lease,"  all  procured  from  the  war 
depai'tment  of  the  government.  This  association  erected  a  forge  on  Marquette 
bay,  on  Lake  Superior,  upon  the  site  of  the  now  beautiful  city  of  Marquette, 
located  upon  one  of  the  most  beautiful  bays  in  the  world,  a  bay  often  likened 
by  European  travelers  to  that  of  Naples,  Marquette  is  a  city  of  beauty  as  it 
rises  from  the  water  by  undulating  ground,  with  a  landscape  background  of  tow- 
ering hills,  well   deserving   the   name  of   mountains. 

The  Jackson  Iron  Company  also  located  a  forge  within  two  miles  of  its  mining 
location  about  the  same  time  the  Marquette  Iron  Company  (the  association  from 
Massachusetts)  located  its  forge  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Superior.  These  smelting 
enterprises  were  neither  of  them  financially  successful,  but  served  the  purpose 
of  testing  the  ores  and  pointing  out  to  capital  the  great  wealth  of  the  region, 
and  were  therefore  pioneer  enterprises  of  the  greatest  importance  to  the  country. 
In  speaking  of  these    forges  and    their    early  history   the    Hon.  Peter  White,  of

66  Michigan  and  its  Resoueces. 

Marquette,  one  of  its  earliest  settlers  and  today  one  of  the  most  prominent  men 
in  the  State,  described  Marquette  as  follows:  "A  few  houses,  a  stumpy  road 
winding  along  the  lake  shore,  a  forge  which  burnt  up  after  impoverishing  its 
first  owners,  a  trail  westward  just  passable  for  wagons  leading  to  another  forge 
(still  more  unfortunate  in  that  it  did  not  burn  up)  and  to  the  undeveloped  iron 
hills  beyond,  a  few  hundred  people  uncertain  of  the  future,  they  were  all  that 
was  in   Marquette  in  1851-2." 

For  many  years  after  the  discovery  of  the  Jackson,  Lake  Superior  and  Cleveland 
mines,  they  were  the  only  ones  operated,  and  together  in  18G1  shipped  about  one 
hundred  tons  of  ore;  whereas  during  the  year  last  passed  there  has  been  shipped 
from  these  iron  regions  of  the  north  over  nine  million  tons,  and  the  greater  por- 
tion of  it  from  that  part  of  the  territory  known  as  the  northern  peninsula  of 
Michigan,  some  of  it  from  the  new  bordering  fields  of  Wisconsin  and  Minnesota. 

Tl^e  early  pioneers  to  whom  we  have  referred  struggled  against  privation,  as  is 
almost  universally  the  case  where  man  enters  nature's  sanctum  and  wrests  from  her 
her  privacy.  These  men  have  lived  to  see  the  wonderful  growth  in  the  mineral 
industries  which  they  had  so  much  to  do  with  bringing  to  the  attention  of  the  capital 
of  the  country,  and  to  see  the  wilderness  blossom  into  prosperous  cities,  and  to 
behold  the  development  of  mighty  industries,  which  is  one  of  the  rewards  to  the 
pioneer  who  has  braved  privations  and  hardships  upon  the  frontier,  a  pleasure 
that  those  schooled  and  housed  in  luxury,  and  who  know  nothing  of  pioneer  life, 
cannot  realize. 

THE   COPPER   COUNTRY. 

"  Let  it  not  be  thought  that  I  am  cracking  up  the  country,"  wrote  John  R.  St.  John 
in  18i9,  prefatory  to  a  book  he  published  descriptive  of  the  copper  country  of  Lake 
Superior,  its  climate,  resources  and  development  to  that  date.  If  his  modest  little 
book  was  deemed  incomplete  then  without  an  apology  for  its  seeming  exaggeration, 
what  would  the  author  say  could  he  witness  the  achievements  of  this  year,  1893, 
scarce  half  a  century  later!  The  "giant  corporations"  of  his  day  were  the  Lake 
Superior  Mining  Co.,  and  the  Pittsburg  and  Boston  Co.,  operating  upon  fissure 
veins  in  Keweenaw  county.  The  Agate  Harbor,  Eagle  Harbor,  and  other  mines 
long  ago  abandoned  as  worthless  were  then  considered  rich  mines.  Nowhere  was 
there  a  shaft  exceeding  eighty  feet  in  depth.  One  company  had  a  very  crude  and 
diminutive  open  air  stamp-mill.  It  was  spoken  of  as  erected  at  a  great  expense  and  a 
failure  as  to  its  returns  on  the  investment.  But  though  almost  utterly  deserted 
now,  Old  Keweenaw  can  justly  be  said  to  be  only  hibernating.  In  the  springtide 
of  a  new  era  she  will  awaken  under  the  stimulus  of  railway  extension  and  closer 
contact  with  the  world,  which  will  bring  her  resources  into  greater  prominence;  for, 
although  thrown  into  the  shade  by  her  great  rival,  the  Portage  Lake  district,  her 
reservoirs  of   mineral  wealth  are  by  no  means  pumped  dry. 

The  story  of  Michigan  copper  mining  is  old  and  very  romantic.  It  extends  back 
as  far  as  the  history  of  the  country  and  throws  a  ray  of  light  into  the  prehistoric 
darkness.  A  race  of  intelligent  beings  mined  copper  systematically  long  before 
the  savage  Indian  possessed  himself  of  the  territory.  Their  traces  were  most  distinct 
on  Isle  Royal  and  in  the  Ontonagon  district.  They  consisted  of  pits  in  which  were 
found    detached  masses  of    metal,  some  of    great  weight     accompanied  by  crude 


Upper  Peninsula  Eesoueces.  67 

implements  whose  form  left  no  doubt  of  their  use  as  mining  tools.  In  one  instance  a 
mass  was  found  lying  upon  a  substructure  consisting  of  layers  of  timbers  placed 
crosswise,  evidently  for  the  purpose  of  lifting  the  mass  to  the  surface.  A  shallow 
pit  found  on  the  outcrop  of  the  Calumet  and  Hecla  conglomerate  in  the  earliest  days 
of  that  mine  was  believed  to  have  been  made  by  those  prehistoric  miners.  The 
museums  and  private  collections  of  the  country  now  contain  all  that  was  found 
of  the  implements,  and  the  operations  of  modern  miners  have  obliterated  the  excava- 
tions of   the   ancients. 

The  written  history  of  the  Lake  Superior  copper  district  may  be  said  to  begin 
with  "  Legardes  Travels,"  a  book  published  in  Paris  in  1636,  and  containing  the  first 
mention  of  copper  on  Lake  Superior,  the  Lac  de  Tracy ^  and  the  only  one  for  many  sub- 
sequent generations.  Speaking  of  the  lake's  south  shore,  he  says:  "There  are  mines 
of  copper  which  might  be  made  profitable  if  there  were  inhabitants  and  workmen 
who  would  labor  faithfully."  He  speaks  of  having  seen  an  ingot  of  copper 
procured  from  the  Huron  Indians,  meaning  by  "ingot"  doubtless  a  small  mass  of 
native  copper.  The  Jesuit  fathers  who  penetrated  the  region  thirty  years  later 
were  alive  to  the  resources  of  the  country  as  well  as  the  state  of  the  savage  souls. 
They  made  careful  note  of  the  metals  found  in  possession  of  the  aborigines  and 
their  journals  published  in  Paris  contain  frequent  mention  of  large  pieces  of  refined 
copper;  not  at  all  remarkable  as  the  native  copper  of  Lake  Superior  was  as  highly 
refined  in  nature's  furnace  as  any  that  could  be  produced  by  the  art  of  the  metallur- 
gist of  1660  to  1700.  One  writer  in  1640  speaks  "of  a  large  island  in  Lake  Superior 
fifty  leagues  in  circuit  upon  which  was  found  a  beautiful  mine  of  copper."  The  island 
was  Isle  Royale  and  the  beautiful  mine  was  the  pit  dug  by  the  prehistoric  miner,  and 
within  the  present  generation  wrought  as  the  Minong  mine.  Doctor  Ben  Franklin 
had  read  these  old  French  manuscripts  and  books  while  resident  in  Paris,  a  fact 
which  he  turned  to  practical  account  when  he  became  one  of  the  commissioners 
to  settle  the  northern  boundary  of  the  United  States.  With  apparent  unconcern 
he  drew  his  pencil  over  the  map  of  Lake  Superior  so  as  to  leave  Isle  Royale  on  the 
United  States  side  of  the  line,  and  so  it  was  ratified. 

In  1765  one  Capt.  Carver  published  a  somewhat  fanciful  account  of  a  journey  from 
Mackinaw  to  the  Mississippi,  and  upon  the  representations  of  his  book  the  first 
company  was  organized  in  London  to  mine  copper  on  Lake  Superior.  Alexander 
Henry,  a  gentlemen  of  adventurous  spirit,  became  the  agent  and  historian  of  this 
enterprise.  He  began  operations  in  the  side  of  a  clay  bank  on  the  shore  of  the 
Ontonagon  river  in  1770.  After  digging  through  forty  feet  of  clay  he  ran  up  sharp 
against  sandstone,  and  left  further  operations  to  those  who  could  guide  their  attempts 
to  gain  copper  by  the  use  of  at  least  a  little  knowledge  of  geology. 

To  Dr.  Douglas  Houghton,  the  first  State  Geologist  of  Michigan,  the  State  and 
the  world  owe  the  development  of  the  copper  mining  industry.  He  it  was  who  first 
intelligently  explored  the  district  and  reduced  the  geologic  data  he  obtained  into 
such  form  and  system  that  the  miner  knew  approximately  where  and  how  to  look 
for  copper.  He  began  his  researches  in  1830,  and  devoted  to  it  all  his  energy  until 
the  melancholy  tragedy  of  1845  put  a  sudden  and  premature  end  to  a  life  that  was 
invaluable  to  civilization.  He  was  drowned  during  a  violent  storm  near  Eagle  river 
on  the  night  of  Oct.  13,  1845.  He  was  almost  ready  to  make  his  final  report  and 
with  him  were  lost  all  his  field  notes. 

It  was  Boston  capital  that  first  undertook  the   development  of  the  copper  region 


68  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

after  Henry's  failure,  and  it  is  Boston   capital   that    today   holds   the   predominant 
interest  in  the  mines. 

The  organization  of  companies  and  location  of  permits  were  begun  in  1842.  Actual 
work  was  for  some  years  confined  to  the  extremety  of  Keweenaw  point.  Some  good 
mines,  notably  the  Cliff,  Phcenix  and  Copper  Falls,  were  opened  on  the  fissure  veins. 
The  only  mine  now  operating  on  a  fissure  vein  is  the  Central,  a  mine  which  has 
yielded  handsome  dividends  and  is  still  profitable.  The  Copper  Falls  mine  main- 
tains a  sporadic  activity,  but  its  operations  are  confined  to  the  "  ashbed "  and 
amygdaloid  lode  lying  along  the  formation.  Some  exploring  had  been  done  at  Portage 
Lake  near  the  site  of  the  Quincey  mine  in  1846-47,  but  that  district  did  not  come 
into  prominence  until  1860.  The  Quincey  then  began  the  pace  which  took  Irer  to 
the  front  rank  of  amygdaloid  mines,  a  position  she  still  maintains  without  a  rival. 

Operations  on  the  Ontonagon  began  in  a  very  small  way  in  1843,  but  it  was  not 
until  1847,  when  the  discovery  of  the  Minnesota  lode  brought  the  district  into 
prominence,  that  mining  began  to  be  conducted  there  on  a  large  scale.  The  discov- 
ery of  the  Calumet  and  Hecla  conglomerate  lode  in  1866  marked  an  epoch  in  copper 
mining,  and  another  epoch  was  marked  when  in  June,  1885,  the  bold  conception  of 
Captain  John  Daniell  was  brought  to  successful  fruition.  That  was  the  cutting  of 
the  Calumet  and  Hecla  lode  at  a  verticle  depth  of  2,270  feet  by  the  Tamarack  shaft. 
The  event  provided  the  Calumet  and  Hecla  a  means  of  measuring  its  resources; 
but,  better  still,  it  demonstrated  the  possibility  and  profit  of  deep  mining. 

Such,  in  brief,  is  a  ragged  outline  of  the  history  of  the  Lake  Superior  copper  region. 
Its  details  are  fraught  with  the  incidents  of  the  most  interesting  character,  but  there 
is  not  space  for   them  here. 

COPPER   PRODUCTION. 

Up  to  January  1,  1892,  the  Lake  Superior  copper  mines  produced  a  grand  total 
of  1,400,034,411  pounds  of  refined  copper,  and  are  now  producing  nearly  twenty  per 
cent  of  the  world's  supply.  The  vein  matter  as  it  comes  from  the  mines  now  being 
wrought  with  profit,  varies  from  seven -eighths  of  one  per  cent  (the  average  at  the 
Atlantic  mine)  to  five  per  cent.  After  passing  through  the  stamp  mills  the  result- 
ing product,  in  the  local  vernacular  called  "mineral,"  separated  from  its  matrix  by 
the  action  of  ponderous  steam  hammers  and  water,  is  concentrated  by  jigs  and  Evans 
tables  and  goes  to  the  smelters  85  per  cent  fine  and  there  reduced  to  commercial 
copper  in  the  form  of  bars,  plates  and  ingots.  In  view  of  its  remarkable  purity 
and  freedom  from  base  metals,  is  it  any  wonder  that  Lake  Superior  copper  is  given 
the  preference  the  world  over  for  all  purposes  requiring  a  superior  grade  of  the 
metal. 

In  1891*  the  copper  production  of  the  Lake  Superior  districts  was  109,370,000 
pounds,  furnished  by  the  principal  mines  as  follows: 

Calumet  &amp;  Hecla 65,000.000        Peninsula ._.      1,609,689

VALUE. 

The  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  this  stupendous  output  of  copper  cannot  be  very 
readily  calculated,  the  fluctuations  of  the  copper  market  ranging  between  a  maxi- 
mum of  something  over  60  cents  per  pound  to  a  minimum  of  a  trifle  less  than  9 
cents.  Some  conception  of  the  profits  can  be  best  gained  from  a  statement  of  the 
dividends  declared  by  the  principal  mining  companies  now  in  operation.  In  addi- 
tion to  this,  it  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  majority  of  these  companies  are  in 
possession  of  the  most  approved  modern  plants,  which  have  cost  vast  fortunes; 
also  immense  tracts  of  real  estate  acquired  at  comparatively  low  prices  and  now 
capable  of  realizing  in  cash  many  times  the  purchase  price,  to  say  nothing  of  the 
various  other  valuable  assets  and  the  stores  of  mineral  still  untouched. 

The  list  of  the  active  dividend  payers,  with  the  amounts  paid  by  each  to  Feb. 
1,  1893,  is  as  follows: 

Mine.  Dividend  paid.  Mine.  Dividend  paid. 

Atlantic 8700,000  Osceola... _      $1,697,500 

Calumet  &amp;  Hecla 38,850,000  Kearsarge 80,000 

Central 1,970,000  Quincy 6,470,000 

Franklin.. 1,100,000  Tamarack.. 3,160,000 


Total $54,027,500 

To  these  same  mines  there  has  been  paid  in  assessments  the  sum  total  of  $3,190,000. 

To  the  total  dividends,  as  above  indicated,  add  the  amounts  paid  by  the  great 
dividend  payers  of  the  pre-Portage  period— the  Cliff,  $2,280,000;  Minnesota,  $1,820,000, 
total,  $4,100,000 — and  we  have  a  grand  total  of  $58,127,500.  There  are  numerous 
other  mines  that,  though  never  or  but  for  a  short  time  on  the  dividend  list,  have 
nevertheless  greatly  enriched  those  interested  in  them  by  their  output  and  the 
amounts  realized  upon  their  available  assets. 

COST    OF   MINING. 

Only  the  most  careful  and  intelligent  management  can  wrest  a  profit  from  cop- 
per mining  at  the  prices  prevailing  during  the  past  five  years,  except  in  case  of 
mines  which,  like  the  Calumet  and  Hecla,  are  in  a  position  to  almost  dictate  the 
market  value  of  the  metal.  Some  of  the  best  results  are  achieved  in  mines  like 
the  Atlantic.  Though  that  mine's  vein  in  matter  averages  but  seven-eighths  per 
cent  mineral,  the  mine  has  steadily  maintained  a  dividend  of  $1.00  per  share  yearly 
and  has  lately  entered  upon  an  immense  construction  account  involving  the  build- 
ing of  a  new  stamp  mill  and  railroad.  The  Tamarack  is  one  of  the  cheapest  pro- 
ducers, and  it  has  bfeen  said  that  company  can  sell  its  product  in  New  York  at  six 
cents  per  pound  and  make  a  profit.  In  1890  that  company  actually  accomplished  the 
feat  of  producing  and  marketing  copper  at  5.9  cents  per  pound.  But  11)^  cents 
per  pound  represents  about  the  maximum  of  cost  in  mines  now  operating;  in  fact 
a  higher  cost  would  necessitate  suspension  of  operation  or  continuation  at  a  loss. 
The  Calumet  and  Hecla  and  the  Tamarack,  Osceola  combination  (the  latter  control- 
ing  the  Tamarack,  Tamarack  Jr.,  Osceola  and  Kearsarge  mines  and  known  locally 
as  the  Clark-Bigelow  syndicate),  have  effected   a  great   saving  in   their   cost  sheet

by  erecting  smelting  works  of  their  own,  and  their  example  is  about  to  be  followed. 
by  the  Quincy. 

It  is  known  that  the  veins  that  follow  the  formation  extend  to  a  great  depth, 
far  beyond  any  yet  attained,  and  that  the  copper  in  them  is  more  evenly  distrib- 
uted than  in  the  fissure  veins  which  also  extend  to  unknown  depths  but  are  so 
irregular  and  "  faulted "  as  to  render  necessary  a  greater  relative  amount  of  "  dead 
work." 

The  formation  extends  in  a  slightly  sinuous  course  from  northeast  to  southwest, 
the  strata  dipping  northwestward  at  an  average  angle  of  about  forty-two  degrees. 
On  its  western  side  lies  Lake  Superior,  while  on  the  east  it  rests  upon  the  Pots- 
dam sandstone.  The  average  width  is  about  14,000  feet  and  the  length  about  six 
miles.  The  main  body  is  a  lava  formed  rock  called  "  trap  "  in  which  are  imbedded 
the  amygdaloids  and  conglomerates  which  now  form  the  commercial  sources  of 
supply,  with  the  single  exception  of  the  Central  mine  which,  as  has  been  stated,  is 
on  a  famous  fissure  vein  crossing  the  formation  at  right  angles. 

The  copper  is  disseminated  in  the  form  of  masses,  sheet  copper,  "barrel  work," 
and  fine  copper.  Some  masses  have  been  formed  many  tons  in  weight  and  have 
had  to  be  cut  with  chisels  into  smaller  bodies  in  order  to  permit  removal  from 
their  matrix.  This  process  is  laborious  and  tedious,  and  instances  are  on  record 
where  in  old  times  the  discovery  of  a  mass  has  been  too  much  of  a  good  thing, 
the  cost  of  getting  it  to  the  surface  exceeding  the  value  of  the  metal.  Masses  and 
sheet  copper  are  largest  and  most  numerous  in  the  fissure  veins.  Sheet  copper  is 
found  in  large  flat  pieces,  generally  very  thin,  but  sheets  have  been  found  eight 
inches  in  thickness.  "  Barrel  work "  consists  of  lumps  of  metal  from  the  size  of  a 
fist  to  that  of  a  foot  ball  and  of  ragged  pieces  too  large  to  run  through  the  stamp 
mill.  The  formation  on  Isle  Royale  is  the  reverse  of  that  on  Keweenaw  Point  as 
to  relative  position  of  the  strata,  sloping  southeasterly  and  indicating  the  continu- 
ity of  the  Keweenaw  stratification,  Lake  Superior  occupying  the  depression.  The 
strata  are  mose  nearly  horizontal,  however,  rarely  tilting  over  thirty  degrees. 

Though  the  prehistoric  miner  seems  to  have  wrought  successfully  in  that  field, 
bis  latter  day  successor  has  been  unable  to  wrest  any  great  wealth  from  Isle 
Royale.  It  has  not  been  through  lack  of  endeavor,  for  explorations  are  still  under 
way.  The  intermediate  Indian  avoided  the  island  whenever  he  could,  believing  it 
to  be  the  abode  of  the  "  Gitchi  Manitou,"  or  Great  Spirit. 

THE   IRON   COUNTRY. 

Three  well  defined  districts — ranges— constitute  the  source  of  the  Michigan  iron 
ore  supply.  They  lie  in  the  western  half  of  the  northern  peninsula  and  trend 
nearly  east  and  west.  They  are  designated  in  the  order  of  discovery  and  develop- 
ment, the  Marquette,  Menominee  and  Gobegic  ranges. 

They  each  have  a  number  of  exceptionally  large  producing  mines.  The  Mar- 
quette range  in  1892  produced  2,666,856  tons  of  ore  from  twenty-eight  operating 
mines,  or  an  average  of  95,000  tons  from  each;  the  Menominee  range  produced 
2,261,499  tons  from  twenty-nine  operating  mines,  or  an  average  of  78,000  tons;  while 
that  portion  of  the  Gogebic  range  lying  wholly  within  the  limits  of  this  State  pro- 
duced 2,568,229  gross  tons  (the  balance  of  this  range  upon  the  Wisconsin  side  of 
Montreal   river    shipped   405,764   tons)   from   seventeen   reporting  operations,  or   an 


Upper  Peninsula  Kesources.  71 

average  of  151,000  tons  for  each  enterprise.  Of  course  this  enormous  average  out- 
put is  due  to  the  phenominal  deposits  operated  by  the  Metropolitan  Land  &amp;  Iron 
Company  and  generally  known  as  the  Norrie  and  East  Norrie  mines,  which  have 
made  the  hitherto  unapproached  output  from  an  all  underground  mine  of  985,216 
tons.  Its  total  output  since  1885  has  been  4,114,623  tons,  or  an  average  of  over 
half  a  million  tons  per  annum,  including  the  year  of  its  discovery.  There  are  only 
three  mines  in  this  State  whose  output  exceeds  that  of  this  mine,  and  the  young- 
est of  the  three,  the  Chapin,  is  over  thirteen  years  old  and  has  shipped  4,367,344 
gross  tons.  The  Lake  Superior  mine  has  shipped,  including  output  of  1892, 
5,718,007,  and  the  Cleveland  mine  5,027,606  gross  tons. 

GENERAL   GEOLOGY. 

These  several  deposits  of  iron  ore  in  the  upper  peninsula  have  thus  far  been 
found  only  in  the  Huronian  series  of  rocks.  This  series  consists  of  quartzites, 
echists,  banded  ore  and  jaspers,  greenstones,  limestones  and  iron  ore,  and  contains 
in  all,  according  to  Brooks,  twenty  distinct  members. 

The  Marquette  region  embraces  the  Huronian  rocks,  extending  from  the  city  of 
the  same  name  westward  to  L'Anse,  a  distance  of  about  forty  miles,  and  contains 
all  the  iron  mines  that  shipped  ore  previous  to  1877.  Geologically,  the  strata  form 
a  broad  synclinal  trough  corrugated  and  folded  in  the  direction  of  its  axis,  resting 
upon  Laurentian  rocks.  The  general  trend  of  the  formation  is  east  and  west,  with 
the  exception  of  a  tongue  of  Huronian  rocks  south  of  Lake  Michigamme  and 
extending  into  the  Laurentian,  in  which  the  Republic  mine  is  located,  and  an  iso- 
lated patch  about  twenty  miles  south  of  Marquette  in  which  the  Cheshire  mine  is 
found.  The  mines  of  this  region  are  in  one  comparatively  compact  belt.  The 
most  easterly  of  the  deposits  of  ore  known  (except  the  Cheshire)  are  in  the  Negau- 
nee  basin,  about  a  mile  west  of  that  town;  the  ores  are  of  the  soft  hematite 
nature,  readily  mined  and  occur  in  enormous  deposits.  At  the  Buffalo  company's 
property  the  ore  was  found  to  lie  in  a  basin  having  a  pitch  to  the  north  and  west. 
This  basin  consisted  of  hematite  and  banded  jasper  schists.  Hard  hematite  first 
shows  itself  in  the  Jackson  mine  immediately  west  of  the  Negaunee.  Here  the 
basin  holding  the  hard  hematites  is  narrow  but  widens  towards  the  west,  and  at 
Michigamme  lake  the  northern  and  southern  veins  are  three  miles  apart.  The 
first  occurrence  of  magnetite  is  at  the  old  Washington  property,  just  south  of  the 
village  of  Humboldt,  thirteen  miles  west  of  Negaunee.  At  this  locality  specular 
hematite,  or  slate  ore,  is  also  present  in  considerable  quantities,  but  further  west 
the  ore  mass  is  almost'  entirely  magnetite. 

The  mines  of  Ishpeming,  which  lie  about  three  miles  west  of  Ishpeming,  are 
famed  for  the  quality  and  continuous  output  they  have  made,  and  are  the  main 
reliance  upon  which  the  reputation  of  this  range  will  depend  for  years  to  come. 
Beginning  their  shipments  a  few  years  after  the  Jackson,  they  have  maintained  a 
regularity  and  uniformity  of  product  that  is  nothing  short  of  wonderful,  and  what 
is  of  full  as  much  importance,  they  give  every  evidence  of  their  ability  to  maintain 
their  output  for  many  more  years.  The  names  of  the  larger  producers  are  familiar  as 
household  words  the  iron  world  over.  Lake  Angeline's  phenomenally  high  percent- 
age of  iron  and  exceedingly  low  phosphorus  gives  it  a  unique  position.     The  Cleve-

land  and  Lake  Superior  have  been  sending  their  high  grade  ores  to  the  eastern 
furnaces  for  over  thirty  years.  Barnum,  Salisbury,  Winthrop  and  Mitchell  are  in 
the  list  of  active  producers  and  will  remain  there  in  spite  of  predictions  made  by 
those  interested  in  newer  ranges. 

The  hard  ore  mines,  specular  slate  and  magnetite,  of  the  western  end  of  the  county 
(from  the  Republic  and  Champion  mines)  have  been  the  standards  of  their  respective 
classes  for  about  twenty  years,  and  their  total  output  foots  up  in  the  millions  of  tons. 
Mining  of  these  ores  is  accomplished  by  ways  and  means  to  which  the  peculiar  nature 
of  the  deposits  lend  themselves.  For  instance,  at  the  Buffalo  group,  the  North-of- 
England,  or  caving  system,  is  adopted  and  operated  with  marked  success,  both  in  the 
cost  of  product  and  amount  of  ore  recovered,  the  losses  being  very  light.  In  this  sys- 
tem of  mining  the  ore  body  is  cut  into  prisms  by  raises  and  drifts.  In  the  center  of  a 
block  of  ore  a  winze  is  raised  and  up  to  the  crushed  and  broken  roof  of  rock  and  tim- 
bers, a  horizontal  cut  is  then  taken  from  the  top  of  the  ore  body  for  say  eight  to  ten 
feet  in  height,  and  starting  from  the  edge  furthest  from  the  mill-hole  or  winze,  the  ore 
is  drawn,  thus  allowing  the  roof  of  sand  and  rock  to  fall  upon  a  floor  of  solid  ore, 
which  had,  before  the  roof  fall,  been  covered  with  logging  of  old  mine  timbers,  poles, 
slabs,  etc.,  by  means  of  which  protection  the  roof,  in  course  of  a  few  falls  becomes  a 
woven  mattress  of  timber,  which  keeps  the  surface  sands  from  mixing  with  and  thus 
lowering  the  grade  of  the  ore. 

In  other  mines,  when  the  covering  of  rock  will  not  fall  regularly 'as  it  does  here 
and  the  ore  body  is  soft,  the  Nevada  system  of  timbering  is  used.  This  consists  in  large 
posts  from  two  to  three  feet  in  diameter,  so  framed  as  to  form  the  skeleton  of  a  cube. 
These  frames  reach  from  one  side  of  the  deposit  to  the  other  and  offer  a  means  of 
attacking  and  removing  the  ore  and  at  the  same  time  supporting  the  roof;  at  intervals 
pillars  of  ore  are  left  in  the  mine  to  help  support  the  roof  and  keep  it  from  caving  in 
unexpectedly.  When  the  roof  is  about  to  fall,  it  is  shown  by  the  pressure  of  one  set 
of  timbers  upon  another,  a  "  cap "  or  piece  of  timber  resting  upon  and  connecting  two 
posts,  being  at  times  cut  half  through  by  the  weight  it  is  bearing.  This  is  the  warning 
given  the  miner  to  keep  out  of  harm's  way.  In  bodies  of  soft  ore  the  evidence  of  these 
timbers  bearing  great  weight  is  very  frequently  seen,  but  it  is  not  necessarily  a  signal 
of  danger,  for  these  crushed,  bent  or  broken  timbers  are  often  removed  while  the  ore 
remains  in  place  and  a  new  set  of  timbers  put  in.  These  very  often  hold  the  passage 
ways  open,  as  the  movement  of  the  ore  may  have  taken  place  previous  to  the  placing 
of  the  later  timbers.  In  some  mines  this  renewal  of  timber  is  constantly  going  on  to 
keep  main  gangways  open.  Sometimes  two  gangways,  or  levels,  are  maintained  to 
insure  access  to  the  shaft  at  all  times,  or  during  repair  of  one  of  the  levels,  which  of 
course  would  be  apt  to  stop  work  at  the  point  of  repair  for  the  time  being. 

The  removal  of  the  pillars,  after  the  sets  of  timbers  have  been  placed  in  position, 
then  follows.  This  is  done  in  the  case  of  some  of  the  Gogebic  mines  by  cutting  into 
the  center  of  the  pillar  at  right  angles  to  its  length  and  directly  across  it,  then  driving 
a  drift  in  the  direction  of  its  main  axis,  i.  e.,  at  right  angles  to  this  cut,  to  the  hanging 
wall,  and  drawing  back  from  this  wall  timbering  to  support  the  ore  above.  Two  sets, 
or  fifteen  feet,  are  taken  off  in  this  manner,  and  if  the  wall  shows  signs  of  weakening, 
the  ore  is  logged  up  and  the  place  vacated  for  a  week,  when,  after  the  fall  of  rocks, 
the  same  general  scheme  of  removal  takes  place. 


Upper  Peninsula  Resources.  73 

In  hard  magnetite  and  specular  hematite  ore  mines  the  ore  occurs  in  lens  or  bean 
shaped  masses,  and  is  removed  by  aid  of  power  or  air  drills.  No  timber  of  any 
amount  is  called  for  in  these  mines,  save  in  places  where  the  walls  are  largely  com- 
posed of  a  talcose  schist,  or  soaprock  as  it  is  locally  termed.  These  places  are 
treacherous  and  large  masses  are  apt  to  fall  if  heavy  timbers  are  not  placed  to 
support  them.  These  timbers  are  of  all  lengths,  depending  on  the  distances  between 
the  foot  and  hanging  walls,  and  are  usually  of  pine;  hemlock  is  being  used  at  times, 
but  it  is  heavier  and  somewhat  brashy,  breaking  across  the  grain  under  heavy 
stress. 

This  outline  of  the  uses  of  timber  and  method  of  mining  will  serve  as  a  descrip- 
tion of  the  three  ranges,  with  the  exception  of  a  few  of  the  hard  ore  mines  which 
have  a  solid  and  compact  hanging  wall  or  roof  requiring  no  timbers  for  support, 
such  as  the  Barnum  mine,  whose  workings  lie  directly  under  the  main  streets  of 
the  city  of  Ishpeming.  Little  does  the  average  visitor  to  this  city  think,  as  he 
walks  the  streets  or  rides  in  the  railroad  or  electric  cars,  that  hundreds  of  feet 
below  him  is  another  city  with  its  streets  laid  out  with  greatest  care  by  the 
engineer,  whose  cars  are  running  day  and  night,  and  where  the  electric  light  burns 
practically  twenty -four  hours  each  day;  and  yet  such  is  a  fact.  It  is  a  sight  that 
should  not  be  missed,  as  an  opportunity  to  visit  and  inspect  the  mines  is  usually 
accorded  to  the  inquu'ing  and  intelligent  traveler. 

In  this  summary  of  the  ores  of  the  Marquette  range,  it  is  seen  there  is  every 
known  variety  found  within  its  limits.  Large  beds  of  limonite  are  known  to  exist 
in  the  vicinity  of  Michigamme,  but  owing  to  the  low  metallic  contents,  averaging 
fifty-three  to  fifty-six  per  cent,  they  will  not  stand  the  cost  of  lake  transportation. 
Many  of  the  mines  possess  immense  reserves  of  low  grade  oar,  which  cannot  be 
shipped  for  the  same  reason.  The  question  then  naturally  occurs,  why  not  utilize 
them  at  some  point  where  fuel  can  be  cheaply  obtained,  and  where  the  ore  can 
be  brought  to  the  furnace  at  low  cost?  Marquette,  with  its  harbor  and  shipping 
facilities,  offers  more  inducement  to  the  steel  and  iron  manufacturer  than  any 
other  point  on  the  lake,  Chicago  not  excepted,  as  the  same  materials  can  be 
assembled  at  a  lower  cost  than  at  that  or  any  other  lake  city.  Coke  has  been 
made  from  Connelsville,  Pennsylvania,  coal,  of  eminently  satisfactory  quality,  and 
can  be  made  at  a  cost  about  equal  to  that  paid  by  Chicago.  Vessels  loading  with 
ore  from  this  point  to  Lake  Erie  ports  will  carry  a  return  cargo  of  Connelsville 
coal  at  rates  varying  from  thirty-five  cents  to  forty  cents  per  toa.  Ores  of  every 
kind  and  grade  for  foundry  or  steel  mixtures  are  available  by  a  short  twelve  to 
twenty  mile  haul,  the  shortest  to  a  manufacturing  point,  from  any  of  the  ranges. 
By  using  low  grade  ores,  i.  e.,  from  fifty-two  (furnace  yield)  to  fifty-eight  per  cent, 
obtaining  them  at  a  price  far  below  the  normal  market,  with  .a  short  haul,  and 
coke  made  upon  the  ground,  utilizing  the  waste  heat  from  the  ores,  there  is  no 
point  today  in  the  central  west  that  can  produce  as  high  grade  pig  metal  at  the 
same  cost  as  can  be  done  here.  This  is  worthy  the  serious  consideration  of  all 
interested  in  the  production  of  pig  iron,  and  figures  are  to  be  had  which  will  dem- 
onstrate the  truth  of  this  statement. 

Menominee  range  lies  about  forty  miles  south  of  the  Marquette  range,  runs  about 
parallel  with  it,  and  is  separated  from  it  by  a  horizon  of  Laurentian  granites, 
gneisses  and  schists.     It  includes  two  ranges   of   iron    ore,    separated   by   a  belt    of

silicious  dolomite.  In  the  southern  range  of  deposits  the  iron  ore  consists  princi- 
pally of  a  soft  specular,  blue  (red)  hematite  which  runs  high  in  iron  and  low  in 
phosphorus.  Although  quite  soft  the  ore  rarely  changes  color  except  on  handling, 
when  it  soon  becomes  coated  with  its  own  red  powder;  by  the  time  the  ore  reaches 
Cleveland,  its  texture  is  apparently  earthy.  The  ore  usually  occurs  in  irregular 
pockets  or  lens-shaped  masses  in  a  banded  quartzose  ferruginous  schist,  which  is 
often  magnetic,  and  thus  enables  the  ranges  to  be  traced  with  the  dip-needle. 
The  ore  itself  does  not  affect  the  compass  needle. 

The  Chapin  mine  at  Iron  Mountain  is  the  phenomenal  property  upon  this  range. 
This  reputation  has  been  acquired  by  reason  of  the  enormous  size  of  the  deposit, 
its  high  grade  and  its  reducability  in  the  furnace  owing  to  its  peculiarly  combined 
elements,  which  have  made  it  a  general  favorite  with  furnace  men.  The  deposit 
is  lens-shaped  in  plan;  that  is.  it  appears  as  two  wedges  placed  back  to  back.  It 
varies  from  three  feet  at  the  extreme  ends  to  something  over  a  hundred  feet  in  the 
widest  portions,  and  is  about  two  thousand  feet  long.  It  has  been  continuously 
operated  since  1880  when  it  sent  to  market  34,.556  gross  tons  of  ore.  Its  total  out- 
put is  over  four  million  tons,  and  it  has  reserves  which  will  enable  it  to  maintain 
its  position  as  the  leading  shipper  of  this  range  for  many  years.  To  put  before  the 
reader  an  illustration  that  may  be  grasped  by  the  imagination  it  may  be  stated 
that  to  convey  the  total  product  of  this  one  mine  in  r  ailroad  cars,  such  as  are  used 
for  carrying  ore  from  the  mines  to  the  docks,  would  require  a  train  of  218,367 
20-ton  cars,  which  at  twenty-three  feet  in  length  would  cover  a  distance  of  5.022,441 
feet,  or  951  miles.    About  the  distance  between  New  York  city  and  Chicago. 

The  Gogebic  range  deposits  vary  in  their  mode  of  occurrence  and  contents  from 
those  of  the  other  two  that  have  been  described.  The  same  series  of  rocks  are 
found,  but  occur  in  a  reverse  order.  For  instance,  while  quartzite  forms  the  hang- 
ing wall  of  the  Marquette  ores,  it  is  the  foot  wall  of  the  Gogebic.  Lying  upon 
the  granites  and  schists  of  the  Laurentian  rocks,  the  Huronian  quartzite  dips  to  the 
north  at  an  angle  of  sixty  to  sixty-five  degrees;  north  and  conformable  to  this  are 
banded  jasper  schists  varying  in  thickness  from  600  to  1,500  feet;  north  of  this  are  the 
red  and  black  slates.  Then  follow  the  traps  and  conglomerates  from  the  northeast, 
in  which,  at  Keweenaw    Point,  the  great  native  copper  mines  are   located. 

The  ore  is  found  lying  in  a  V  shaped  trough,  the  left  leg  of  the  V  being  quartz- 
ite. the  right  a  more  or  less  decomposed  diorite  dyke,  which  are  found  underlying 
each  other  and  cutting  through  the  ore  formation  to  the  granites,  the  covering  or 
capping  of  the  ore  being  the  banded  jasper  schist.  The  probable  origin  of  the  ore 
has  been  closely  studied  by  Prof.  J.  R  VanHise,  of  the  University  of  Wisconsin. 
Briefly,  it  is  the  result  of  a  concentration  of  the  ore  that  decomposition  of  the 
banded  jasper  schists  has  liberated.  Exploration  has  proved  the  existence  of  four 
or  five  of  these  dykes  upon  which  ore  in  varying  amounts  has  been  found. 

In  several  places  the  ore  came  to  the  surface,  and  notably  at  the  Colby  mine  at 
Bessemer  and  the  Aurora  mine  at  Ironwood,  where  large  quantities  were  obtained 
at  a  very  low  mining  cost.  The  ore  is  very  uniform  physically  and  chemically.  It 
is  a  soft  red  hematite  with  moisture  varying  from  five  to  fourteen. per  cent;  a  typical 
analysis  of  the  better  grade  would  be  sixty-three  per  cent  of  iron,  five  per  cent  of 
silica  and  about  thirty-five  thousandths  per  cent  phosphorus.  The  general  mode  of 
mining  is  by  means  of  rooms  and  pillars,  the  ground  being  supported  by  sets  of  timbers 
as  elsewhere  described.    At  the  Brotherton  mine  the  caving  system  has  been  used

since  the  opening  of  the  property,  and  it  has  proved  economical  and  safe  and 
yields  a  large  percentage  of  the  ore.  The  ore  is  sent  mainly  to  Ashland  (forty 
miles  west  of  Ironwood)  docks  when  it  is  sent  by  lake  to  Cleveland,  Ashtabula 
(Ohio  ports),  or  to  Buffalo,  N.  Y.,  for  transportation  to  the  furnaces  of  the  Ohio 
valley  and  Pittsburg. 

IRON  PRODUCT  BY  RANGES. 

The  product  of  these  three  ranges  is  shipped  from  Marquette,  Gladstone,  Esca- 
naba,  Michigan,  and  Ashland,  Wisconsin.  A  small  quantity  is  sent  by  rail  to 
the  dock  at  St.  Ignace.  Considerable  ore  is  locally  used  and  cast  into  pig  at 
the  charcoal  furnaces  of   Ishpeming,   Negaunee,  Marquette   and  Newberry. 

The  aggregate  production  of  the  three  ranges,  exclusive  of  the  mines  in  Wis- 
consin, is  shown  in  the  following  tables.  The  mines  named  in  the  tables  are 
those   which  have  produced   upwards  of   100.000   long   tons  each.

The  rate  of  production  indicated  by  the  foregoing  tables  would  seem  at  a  casual 
glance  to  fix  not  a  very  remote  limit  to  the  supply.  But  the  recent  successful 
ventures  in  deep  mining,  and  the  now  well  established  fact  that  many  of  the  lenses 
of  ore  continue  to  great  depths,  the  immense  area  still  awaiting  a  thorough 
exploration,  and  the  promise  of  electrical  concentration  to  render  valuable  the  all 
but  inexhaustible  stores  of  lean  ore,  place  the  limit  beyond  calculation. 

By  the  Edison  process  of  electrical  concentration  iron  ore  containing  but  twenty 
per  cent  metallic  iron  has  been  profitably  treated  and  raised  to  a  grade  of  seventy 
per  cent,  or  within  two  per  cent  of  chemically  pure  magnetite,  while  the  phospho- 
rus has  been  reduced  so  as  to  permit  the  use  of  such  concentrates  for  still  mak- 
ing. One  carload  at  the  experimental  station  near  Humboldt  attained  seventy-one 
and  four-tenths  per  centum  of  iron.  The  station  was  consumed  by  fire  in  1891 
while  experiments  were  still  in  progress.  It  is  understood,  however,  that  Mr. 
Edison  regards  the  process  as  an  established  success  and  has  effected  a  lease  of 
the  Spurr  mine  near  Michigamme  for  the  purpose  of  beginning  the  concentration 
of  ores  on  a  commercial  scale. 

THE   SHIPPING   PORTS. 


The  Lake  Superior  region  furnished  nearly  55  per  cent  of  all  the  ore  mined  in 
the  United  States  in  1892,  and  of  that  quantity  Michigan  furnished  86  per  cent. 
In  no  other  part  of  the  world  are  there  equal  facilities  for  the  handling  and  trans- 
portation of  such  vast  quantities  of  ore.  A  practically  all-water  route  from  the 
mine  to  the  furnaces  makes  possible  the  transportation  of  ores  in  great  bulks.  In 
fact,  but  for  this  provision  of  nature,  the  district  would  be  almost  worthless  on 
account  of  the  prohibitory  cost  of  railway  transportation  in  carload  lots.  The 
great  extent  of  coast  line  and  its  deep  indentations  afford  a  number  of  fine  har- 
bors which  have  been  equipped  expressly  for  the  handling  of  iron  ore.  A  brief 
account  of  these  harbors  will  be  of  interest. 

The  first  Lake  Superior  iron  ore  was  shipped  from  Marquette  early  in  the  fifties, 
and  up  to  the  close  of  1892  a  total  of  18,644,203  tons  had  passed  from  its  docks 
into  the  holds  of  vessels.  The  amount  shipped  in  1892  was  1,027,323  tons.  Until 
1879  Marquette  held  the  lead  in  quantity  of  ore  handled,  but  in  that  year  Esca- 
naba  gained  it.  Three  docks,  one  recently  built  and  another  greatly  extended, 
together  with  their  incidental  rolling  stock,  constitute  the  equipment  for  trans- 
ferring the  ore  from  the  cars  into  the  holds  of  lake  carriers.  No.  4  dock,  built  in 
1889-90,  is  a  specimen  of  the   most  modern  and   perfect  structure  of   its  class,  and

cost  $250,000.  It  was  fully  desciibecl  and  illustrated  with  the  designer's  drawings 
in  the  New  York  Engineering  and  Mining  Journal  of  January  10  and  17,  1891. 
Herewith  is  a  brief  description  of  the  three  docks,  all  owned  by  the  Duluth,  South 
Shore  &amp;  Atlantic  Railway  Company: 

No.  1.  Height  of  dock  above  water  42  feet  for  first  1,300  feet  of  its  length;  the 
new  extension  of  600  feet  is  ii  feet  above  water;  number  of  pockets,  270;  number  of 
tracks,  3;  capacity,  27,000  long  tons. 

No.  2.  This  was  a  small  and  antiquated  structure;  in  1892  it  was  dismantled  and  a 
merchandise  pier   was  erected  on   the   piles. 

No.  3.  Height  of  dock  above  water,  44:  feet;  length,  1,600  feet;  number  of 
pockets,  300;    number  of  tracks,  3 ;    capacity,  25,000  long  tons. 

No.  4.  Height  above  water,  47.5  feet;  length,  1,400  feet;  number  of  pockets, 
200;    number  of   tracks,  4;    capacity,  30,000  long   tons. 

L'Anse  became  an  ore  shipping  port  in  1873  by  the  building  of  a  dock,  owned 
by  the  D.  S.  S.  &amp;  A.  Railroad  Company,  for  the  handling  of  the  product  from 
the  west  end  of  Marquette  range.  The  dock  is  38  feet  high,  1,000  feet  long, 
contains  100  pockets  and  has  a  capacity  of  8,000  long  tons.  No  ore  has  been 
shipped  thence  since   1885;    the  total   reached   744,697   tons. 

St.  Ignace  has  been  a  shipping  port  on  a  small  scale  since  1882.  and  has 
handled  610,315  tons  of  ore.  In  1891  the  dock  was  shortened  400  feet,  the 
material  being  removed  to  Marquette  for  the  extension  of  dock  No.  1  there. 
As  constructed,  it  was  800  feet  long,  42  feet  high;  contained  100  pockets  and  3 
tracks,  and  had  a  capacity  of  10,000  long  tons. 

Escanaba  has  maintained  the  lead  she  won  in  1879  and  her  aggregate  ton- 
nage of  iron  ore  in  1891  and  1892  led  the  world.  Shipments  began  in  1865  by 
putting  the  Marquette  range  under  tribute;  in  1877  the  new  Menominee  range 
began  to  empty  her  treasures  into  the  lap  of  the  coming  iron  port  of  the 
world;  in  1892  her  shipments  were  4,012,197  tons,  nearly  half  the  entire  ore 
shipment  of  the  whole  Lake  Superior  region,  and  the  stupendous  total  of  33,- 
875,454  tons  of  iron  ore  has  passed  through  her  gates  en  route  to  lower  lake 
receiving  ports.  The  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern  railway  company  is  the  owner  of 
the  five  immense  docks  at  Escanaba.  These  docks,  together  with  their  equip- 
ment of  cars,  cost  S2,290,000,  and  are  described  as  follows: 

No.  1.  Height,  46  feet;  length,  1,104  feet;  pockets,  184;  tracks,  2;  capacity,  23,000 
long  tons. 

No.  2.  Height,  39  feet;  length  1,082  feet;  pockets.  182;  tracks,  2;  capacity,  19,300 
long  tons. 

No.  .3.  Height,  39  feet;  length,  1,212  feet;  pockets,  202;  tracks.  2;  capacity,  20,000 
long  tons. 

No.  4.  Height,  46  feet;  length  1,500  feet;  pockets,  250;  tracks,  2;  capacity,  3:3,200 
long  tons. 

No.  5.  Height,  51  feet.  10  inches;  length,  1,392  feet;  pockets,  232;  tracks,  2;  capac- 
ity, 40,600  long  tons. 

At  Ashland  the  Wisconsin  Central  railroad  has  one  dock  46  feet  high,  1,404  feet 
long,  with  234  pockets.  3  tracks,  and  a  capacity  of  28,250  long  tons.  With  its 
equipments  the  total  cost  was  S644,000.  The  Milwaukee,  Lake  Shore  and  Western 
has  two    docks    there,    one    40    and    the  other   45   feet   high,  each   1,404  feet  long.

with  234  pockets;  one  has  4  and  the  other  3  tracks;  their  capacity  respectively  is 
23,000  and  27,000  long  tons.    The  total  cost  of  equipment  was  $813,000. 

Gladstone,  Michigan,  shares  with  Escanaba  the  care  of  the  Menominee  range 
product,  and  an  occasional  cargo  of  Gogebic  and  Marquette  ore  goes  out  of  that 
port.  Shipments  began  in  1889,  and  attained  an  aggregate  of  458,711  tons  at  the 
end  of  1892.  The  Minneapolis,  Sault  Ste.  Marie  &amp;  Atlantic  (Soo  line)  is  the  owner 
of  the  dockage  facilities,  which  consist  of  one  dock  47  feet  high,  about  1,200  feet 
in  length,  with  120  pockets,  5  tracks  and  a  capacity  of  16,000  long  tons. 

The  docks  are  all  wooden  structures.  The  upper  dock  or  floor  is  from  40  to  50 
feet  above  water  level,  sufficient  to  accommodate  bins  of  15  to  20  feet  depth  with 
outward  sloping  bottoms  below  the  floor  level,  and  yet  high  enough  to  be  well 
above  the  rail  of  the  largest  vessel  lying  alongside.  Plate  iron  chutes  or  spouts 
are  hinged  beneath  small  doors  at  the  bottom  of  the  pockets.  The  doors  are  con- 
trolled from  the  top  of  the  dock,  and  when  opened  they  discharge  the  ore  through 
the  chutes  into  the  hold  of  the  vessel.  In  this  manner  a  cargo  of  three  thousand 
tons  is  often  loaded  in  three  hours.  As  many  pockets  can  be  simultaneously  dis- 
charged as  there  are  hatchways  in  the  vessels.  As  the  principal  mining  companies 
are  the  owners  of  fleets  of  modern  and  capacious  lake  carriers  employed  exclusively 
in  the  ore  transport  business,  the  product  of  the  mines  thus  receives  most  expedi- 
tious conveyance  to  the  furnaces. 

BILBOA   AND    LAKE   SUPERIOR   COMPARED. 


The  Bilboa  district  in  Spain  is  the  only  iron  producer  in  the  world  which  will 
stand  comparison  with  the  Lake  Superior  district,  with  great  disparity  as  to  quan- 
tity. The  output,  previous  to  1860,  of  the  Bilboa  district  is  not  known.  For  the 
same  period  the  production  of  the  Marquette  range,  the  only  producing  range  in 
the  Lake  Superior  district  to  1860  and  for  many  years  after,  is  estimated  at  203,676 
long  tons.  The  figures  for  the  Bilboa  district  are  given  in  metric  tons;  but  as  the 
metric  ton  has  an  advantage  of  only  thirty-four  pounds  over  the  long  ton,  the 
quantities,  as  reported  by  the  chief  mining  engineer  of  the  province,  may  be  com- 
pared with  the  Lake  Superior  figures  as  shown  in  the  following  table  prepared  by 
John  Birkinbine  for  embodiment  in  his  1891  report  on  mineral  resources  to  the 
census  bureau  of  the  United  States:

Yearly  average  for  thirty-one  years:  Bilboa  district,  1,451,815  metric  tons;  Lake 
Superior,  1,856,445  long  tons.  Output  for  1891  of  Bilboa  district,  not  known;  Lake

The  important  position  held  by  Michigan  is  well  illustrated  by  comparing  her 
singly  with  the  Lake  Superior  district's  great  Spanish  competitor  from  1885  to 
1890,  the  year  1885  being  the  first  that  the  Gogebic  range  appeared  as  a  producer 
of  any  importance.  The  following  table  is  also  taken  from  Birkinbine's

UPPER    PENINSULA  SANDSTONE. 

The  sandstones  of  the  upper  peninsula  are  all  located  in  the  Potsdam  horizon 
and  quarries  are  operated  at  four  points,  all  located  upon  the  south  shore  of  Lake 
Superior.  They  are  composed  of  rounded  and  angular  grains  of  sand  rock.  The 
cementing  material  of  sandstones  very  largely  affect  the  color  of  the  stone  and  may 
be  either  silica,  carbonate  of  lime,  or  oxide  of  iron,  the  colors  of  the  stone  in  a 
measure  determining  the  nature  of  the  cement.  Silica  alone  produces  a  whitish, 
hard,  compact  stone;  carbonate  of  lime  a  blue  or  gray,  soft  and  easy  to  work; 
while  »on  oxide  yields  the  red  and  brown  sandstones,  usually  working  very  free. 
This  is  particularly  true  of  the  sheets  of  Lake  Superior  stone.  It  cuts  freer  and 
easier  in  all  directions  than  any  other  stone  that  may  be  regarded  as  a  competitor 
in  the  market. 

The  grain  of  the  stone  is  usually  quite  fine,  so  much  so  that  in  the  case  of  the 
rock  produced  in  the  vicinity  of  Portage  Entry  it  is  said  to  have  a  liver  texture. 
The  most  important  producing  locality  is  Portage  Entry,  sixteen  miles  southeast  of 
Houghton.  Here  are  four  large  quarries  operating.  The  sheet  of  stone  has  a  soil 
covering  of  from  sixteen  to  thirty  feet,  then  four  feet  of  broken  rock  or  rubble, 
then  the  eight-foot  sheet  of  clear  brown  stone.  The  stone  is  very  uniform  in  color 
and  texture,  as  indeed  it  is  at  all  the  quarries. 

The  Portage  Red  Sandstone  Company  holds  the  land  adjoining  the  above 
described  property  and  the  rock  is  the  same  in  both.  It  may  be  of  interest  to 
those  interested  in  quarries  to  know  the  composition  of  this  rock  and  herewith  is 

given  an  analysis,  which  may  be  taken  as  typical:

The  Lake  Superior  Red  Sandstone  Company  is  close  neighbor  to  the  foregoing 
operators,  has  an  average  of  thirty  feet  of  stripping  and  a  sheet  of  clear  stone 
eleven  feet  thick;  while  another  quarry  in  the  same  vicinity,  the  Kerber-Jacobs, 
has  twenty-five  feet  of  covering  and  a  sixteen-foot  sheet;  in  places  it  has  been 
found  twenty  feet.  A  cone  four  inches  in  diameter  and  fifteen  feet,  seven  inches 
long,  has  been  taken  from  this  sheet  and  will  be  found  exhibited  in  the  Mich- 
igan department  of  the  mining  building.  The  magnificent  triumphal  arch  found 
at  the  entrance  to  Michigan's  mineral  exhibit,  is  built  of  Portage  Entry  stone.  It 
speaks  for  itself  in  its  color,  texture  and  carving  qualities  and  a  visit  to  it  will 
well   repay  those  interested  in  ornamental  building  stones. 

This  stone  is  shipped  as  far  west  as  Kansas  City,  Mo.,  south  to  St.  Louis,  and 
as  far  east  as  New  York  city  and  Philadelphia;  Duluth,  Chicago  and  Buffalo  being 
the  three  lake  ports  used  for  distributing  inland.  The  finest  quality  of  the  red- 
stone  sells  for  ninety  cents  per  cubic  foot,  delivered  at  any  lake  port,  and 
variegated,  i.  e.,  streaked  or  mottled  with  white,  for  seventy-five  cents  per  foot. 
Chicago,  St.  Louis  and  Buffalo  each  receive  about  twenty-five  per  cent  of  the 
annual  shipiuent;  Duluth,  as  a  shipping  point  to  St.  Paul,  Minneapolis  and  Kansas 
City,  fifteen  per  cent,  while  the  remaining  ten   per  cent  is  shipped  to  Cleveland.

At  Marquette  the  stone  is  of  a  different  color.  While  retaining  the  same 
texture  and  weathering  qualities  as  the  redstone  district,  it  is  of  brown  and 
purplish  hues,  the  former  being  the  handsomest  stone  quarried  on  the  lake, 
though  the  amount,  unfortunately,  is  limited.  A  peculiarity  of  the  purplish  stone 
is  the  rain  drop  effect.  When  viewed  in  certain  lights  the  stone  appears  as  though 
a  few  heavy  drops  of  rain  had  fallen  on  it  and  the  moisture  partly  absorbed.  It  is 
a  very  general  favorite  with  Chicago  builders,  and  the  palatial  home  of  the  Hon.  J. 
M.  Longyear,  of  the  city  of  Marquette,  is  built  of  it.  There  are  three  or  four  sheets 
having  an  average  of  three  and  one-half  feet  thickness,  and  covered  with  four  to 
forty  feet  of  soil,  the  quarry  being  located  on  a  hillside.  It  sells  for  65  cents  at  the 
lake  ports,  while  the  variegated  stone  is  worth  40  cents,  the  clear  brownstone  selling 
for  $1.30  per  cubic  foot.  At  Rock  River,  25  miles  east  of  Marquette,  a  new  purplish 
stone  has  been  found  and  partly  developed  last  year.  It  promises  exceedingly  well, 
as  there  is  a  clear  sheet  of  redstone  seven  feet  thick,  overlaid  by  nineteen  feet  of  soil 
and  two  of  shaley  stone.    About  1,000  cubic  feet  were  shipped  last  year. 

Note.— It  is  impossible  to  describe  accurately  these  stone  formations  without  at  the  same  time  making 
mention  of  special  quarries  and  companies,  and  it  is  not  intended  to  be  understood  that  the  wonderful 
sandstone  formation  of  the  upper  peninsula  is  confined  to  places  mentioned.  It  is  confidently  asserted 
that  the  richness,  variety  and  extent  of  hidden  formations  is  untested  and  unknown.  Each  year  develops 
some  hidden  deposit  far  beyond  even  the  suspicion  of  its  existence.  Neither  was  it  intended  that  any 
one  person  should  hold  a  master  key  to  all  the  hidden  recesses  of  nature's  great  storehouse. 

The  upper  peninsula  is  one  of  nature's  great  banking  houses,  whose  capital  stock  is  its  deposits,  sub- 
ject to  be  drawn  only  by  the  pick  and  shovel ;  with  no  exacting  cashier  to  count,  no  identification 
required,  no  security  asked;  simply  locate  the  funds  ;  open  the  doors ;  help  yourself.

the  gold  mines. 

As  if  the  upper  peninsula  were  not  sufficiently  blest  in  its  mineral  resources, 
with  its  vast  treasures  of  iron  ore  that  years  will  not  suffice  to  exhaust;  with 
its  unique  and  wonderful  deposits  of  native  copper,  the  only  occurrence  of  its 
kind  in  the  world;  with  its  stores  of  building  stones,  slates  and  clays,  it  must 
needs  be  further  blest  by  the  glittering  of  gold  in  veins.  About  four  miles 
northwest  of  the  city  of  Ishpeming  is  located  the  Ropes  gold  mine,  so  named 
after  its  discoverer,  which  has  been  in  operation  for  12  years.  It  offers  to  the 
visitor  a  trip  of  more  than  ordinary  interest.  Its  65  ponderous  stamps  dropping 
incessantly  crushing  the  quartz  and  liberating  the  precious  yellow  metal,  its 
vibrating  vanning  machines  which  save  the  baser  metals  with  their  share  of 
gold— these  all  add  features  of  interest  to  a  trip  to  the  mining  regions  of  the 
upper   peninsula. 

As  has  been  stated  by  the  commissioner  of  mineral  statistics  for  1885,  a  great 
deal  has  been  said  from  time  to  time  and  innumerable  conjectures  made 
respecting  the  existence  of  gold  among  the  mineral  deposits  of  the  Lake  Supe- 
rior region.  The  discovery  of  veins  of  quartz  fabulously  rich  in  this  precious 
metal  has  been  so  often  reported  and  investigated  that  something  more  than 
the  mere  claims  of  interested  parties  were  needed  to  establish  public  confidence, 
or  even  awaken  interest  in  the  reported  finds  of  deposits  rich  in  gold.  Gold 
bearing  quartz  veins  are  not  of  infrequent  occurrence;  specimens  of  gold  have 
been  found  in  this  district  that  for  richness  could  not  be  excelled  by  any 
found  in  this  country.  The  exhibit  made  a  year  or  two  ago  of  cabinet  speci- 
mens was  truly   a  remarkable  one,  both  in   point  of   number   and   value. 

Early  geologists  are  said  to  have  made  verbal  reports  respecting  their  belief 
in  the  existence  of  gold,  and  among  the  earliest  companies  organized  were 
those  which  intended  to  explore  for  gold  or  silver.  It  was  not  before  1886 
that  this  district  attracted  wide-spread  attention  owing  to  the  phenomenal  show- 
ing made  upon  the  Michigan  Gold  Company's  land  and  that  of  its  immediate 
neighbors.  These  discoveries  are  about  three  miles  west  of  the  Ropes  mine  and 
are  located  in  hills  of  serpentine  and  marble,  many  specimens  of  which  had 
been  collected  and  polished  by  Mr.  Ropes.  Great  ridges  of  serpentine  and  mar- 
ble may  be  traced  for  miles.  These  minerals,  as  they  are  there  found,  are 
possessed  of  qualities  of  color,  grain  and  texture  that  render  the  formation  of 
great  economic  value.  Slabs  and  pieces  of  this  rock  may  be  seen  in  a  polished 
state  at  the  exhibit  in  the  mines  and  mining  building.  The  whole  formation  has 
an  east  and  west  trend  and  is  composed  of  bare,  sharp  ridges  of  serpentine, 
marble,  magnesian  schists,  greenstone  and  quartzite,  all  correlated  under  the  general 
term  serpentine  formation. 

Gold  was  first  found  in  1881  near  the  east  line  of  the  present  property  (S.  ^  of  the 
N.  W.  \i  Sec.  29,  T.  48,  R.  27)  and  500  feet  south  of  the  northeast  corner.  To  the  west 
is  greenstone,  and  south  of  it  the  massive  serpentine,  followed  by  magnesian  schists, 
in  which  latter  are  found  the  various  quartz  seams,  including  the  one  in  which  the 
original  discovery  of  gold  was  made.  Regular  mining  was  begun  in  1882,  and  during 
the  winter  following  a  shaft  was  sunk  80  feet.  The  succeeding  summer  saw  a  5-stamp 
mill  erected,  and  it  has  continued  its  operations  of  sinking,  drifting  and  topping 
ever  since,  with  practically  no  stoppage.    The  five  stamps  have  given   place  to  a

magnificent  modern  65-stamp  mill  and  today  the  mine  and  surface  equipments  are 
in  admirable  shape  and  reflect  credit  upon  the  management.  The  mine  is  developed 
by  two  shafts,  one  of  which  is  about  700  feet  deep.     They  mill  them  locally.

SERPENTINES. 


The  serpentine  group,  incidentally  mentioned  when  describing  the  occurrence  of 
gold,  deserves  more  than  a  passing  notice.  The  number  of  places  in  which  this  rock 
is  found  in  the  United  States  is  quite  large,  but  they  do  not  all  contain  the  precious 
serpentine,  or  what  is  known  as  verde  antique.  This  field  contains  both  the  ordinary 
and  the  precious.  The  latter  is  a  beautiful  stone  when  polished,  with  its  deep  greens 
of  all  shades,  while  veinings  or  markings  give  it  an  added  value.  Large  columns  and 
slabs  of  it  have  been  cut  and  polished,  showing  its  susceptibility  to  such  treat- 
ment and  proving  its  adaptability  for  interior  decorat^pns.  From  the  nature  of  the 
stone  it  is  not  at  all  fitted  for  exposure  to  the  elements;  but  this  statement  is  true  of 
every  rock  having  the  same  composition.  It  is  a  silicate  of  magnesia,  carrying  a 
considerable  amount  of  water,  and  usually  has  a  notable  percentage  of  iron  pro- 
toxides, together  with  chrome  iron,  hornblende,  olivine,  and  minerals  of  the  pyrox- 
ene group.  It  is  a  soft  though  somewhat  tough  rock  of  variable  color,  usually 
greenish,  though  often  variously  streaked  and  spotted  with  yellow,  brownish,  or 
more  rarely  red,  its  color  depending  upon  the  degree  of  oxidation  undergone  by  the 
included  iron  minerals. 

There  is  a  wide  field  here  awaiting  the  advent  of  capital  that  is  familiar  with 
material  of  this  kind,  as  the  amount  is  inexhaustible.  It  can  be  readily  reached  by 
railroad,  thus  offering  ready  access  to  markets.  A  short  haul  of  twenty  miles  would 
bring  the  rock  to  Marquette,  whence  it  could  be  shipped  to  Buffalo  for  eastern 
markets  or  to  Duluth  for  the  western  trade. 


WAVERLY    STONE,    HOLLAND. 


Quarries  of  Waverly  stone  are  located  at  Holland,  Ottawa  county,  State  of  Mich- 
igan and  are  in  the  sub-carboniferous  sand  rock,  known  to  geologists  as  the  Waverly 
formation  from  its  extensive  development  at  Waverly,  Ohio.  The  stone  is  bluish 
gray,  uniform  in  color,  free  from  stains  and  spots,  and  from  the  iron  pyrites  which 
deface  and  stain  the  stone  from  some  of  the  other  localities  in  this  formation. 
The  cement  is  silica  and  when  the  stone  is  exposed  to  the  air  it  hardens  and 
becomes  practically  indestructible  by  heat,  frost  and  atmospheric  influence.  It  has 
an  average  crushing  strength  of  8,200  pounds  to  the  cubic  inch,  as  tested  at  the 
State  University  at  Madison,  Wisconsin. 

Its  uniformity  of  color,  fineness  of  grain  and  strength  make  it  a  superior  stone 
for  cutting,  it  being  susceptible  of  the  most  delicate  carving. 

Although  the  quarries  have  been  very  recently  opened,  the  stone  has  been  exten- 
sively used  in  western  Michigan.  In  Muskegon,  South  Haven,  Allegan  and  Hol- 
land some  very  fine  and  expensive  buildings  have  been  erected  entirely  of  this 
stone  and  excite  the  admiration  of  all  who  see  them,  and  the  stone  is  being  freely 
used  in  all  the  best  structures  for  foundations  and  trimmings,  the  greater  share 
going  to  the  cities  of  Grand  Rapids  and  Muskegon, 


GRINDSTONE. 


The  grindstone  quarries  of  Huron  county  were  tirst  discovered  by  Capt.  A.  G. 
Peer  about  the  year  1850.  These  quarries  are  situated  at  Grindstone  City,  on  the 
shores  of  Lake  Huron,  twenty-four  miles  northeast  of  Bad  Axe,  the  county  seat, 
and  ninety  miles  above  Port  Huron.  The  stone  of  Huron  county  is  the  most  val- 
uable for  wet  grinding  found  in  the  United  States.  Lake  Huron  blue  stone  is 
known  in  every  market  in  the  United  States  and  in  some  foreign  countries.  The 
demand  for  scythe  stones  and  grindstones,  from  the  five  pound  kitchen  stone  to 
those  used  in  large  factories  and  weighing  nearly  9,000  pounds,  exceeds  the  supply 
and  this,  notwithstanding  increased  facilities  have  been  added  each  year.  About 
10,000  tons  of  grindstones  and  12,000  gross  of  scythe  stones  are  manufactured  annu- 
ally and  the  supply  is  unlimited.  These  quarries  are  operated  by  the  Cleveland 
Stone  Company  and  the  Lake  Huron  Stone  Company. 

About  twenty-four  miles  south  and  west  from  Grindstone  City,  near  Bay  Port, 
on  Saginaw  Bay,  are  located  the  Bay  Port  quarries,  which,  though  not  at  present 
actively  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  grindstones,  have  several  layers  of  coarse 
and  fine  sandstone,  six  to  ten  feet  in  thickness,  and  similar  in  quality  to  the 
renowned  grindstone  of  Grindstone  City. 


CHARCOAL    PIG    IRON. 


In  the  production  of  charcoal  pig  iron,  Michigan  leads  all  the  states  as  well  as 
in  iron  ore.  The  census  of  1890  report  in  operation  in  twenty-four  states,  one  hun- 
dred and  nineteen  charcoal  plant  furnaces,  representing  a  total  capital  of  $20,068,- 
715,  with  a  total  product  in  the  year  of  664,497  tons  of  charcoal  pig,  valued  at 
$11,985,103.  Of  these  values  Michigan's  twenty-one  furnaces  produced  $3,982,287, 
almost  one-third,  Alabama  and  Wisconsin  coming  next  with  $1,940,875  and  $1,464,- 
775  respectively.  Michigan's  capital  united  in  1890  was  $5,689,701,  more  than  a 
quarter  of  the  whole,  an  increase  over  1880  of  $2,500,000,  while  the  value  of  the 
output  increased  $837,000  over  1880  despite  the  great  fall  in  prices.  There  was  an 
increase  in  1890  over  1880  in  the  total  product  of  charcoal  pig  iron  in  the  United 
States  of  229.479  tons,  or  fifty-two  and  three-quarters  per  cent,  and  yet  the  value 
of  the  total  product  for  1880  exceeded  that  for  1890  by  $890,893. 

The  Michigan  furnace  companies  employed  six  hundred  and  seventy-five  hands 
in  1890  exclusive  of  officers,  clerks  and  salesmen,  and  paid  to  them  $321,032  in 
wages. 


RIVERS   AND    WATER    POWERS    IN    MICHIGAN. 


BY   S.    B.    M  CKACKEN. 


It  would  be  impossible  without  a  scientific  survey  to  give  a  full  presentation  of 
the  water  power  facilities  of  Michigan.  The  plan  pursued  in  compiling  the  mat- 
ter herein  was  by  circulars  addressed  to  members  of  committees  working  in  con- 
junction with  the  Michigan  World's  Fair  Managers  And  others,  in  the  various 
localities.  The  replies  to  these  circulars  were  in  many  cases  prompt  and  quite  full, 
while  in  very  many  other  cases  no  replies  were  received.  The  matter  as  presented 
herein  makes  the  best  showing  possible  under  the  circumstances.  The  compiler's 
personal  acquaintance  with  the  lower  peninsula  (more  especially  the  southern  part 
of  it),  has  made  possible  a  fuller  report  upon  that  section  than  upon  other  parts 
of  the  state. 

It  should  be  borne  in  mind,  however,  that  the  reports  from  which  the  matter  is 
made  up  are  merely  the  conceptions  of  those  having  but  a  practical  knowledge  of 
the  several  localities,  and  are  largely  little  else  than  guess  work.  It  is  believed 
that  the  estimates  are  in  most  cases  below  the  facts.  To  be  accurate  and  reliable 
the  facts  should  be  ascertained  by  scientific  methods  which  alone  are  exact. 

In  treating  of  the  different  rivers  much  use  has  necessarily  been  made  of  the 
maps,  and  it  is  proper  to  say  that  these  do  not  in  all  cases  agree.  The  altitudes 
given  have  reference  to  lake  levels  and  are  on  the  basis  of  railroad  surveys.  These 
do  not  in  all  cases  show  the  water  levels,  as  the  point  from  which  they  are  com- 
puted sometimes  lie  considerable  higher  than  the  mean  levels  through  which  the 
streams  flow. 

Prof.  F.  W.  Denton,  of  the  Mining  School  at  Houghton,  very  kindly  undertook 
to  make  report  upon  the  water  power  of  the  upper  peninsula.  He  writes,  however, 
that  the  responses  to  the  circulars  sent  out  by  him  have  been  very  meagre,  not 
more  than  three  or  four  having  been  received.  He  adds,  "The  trouble  has  been 
largely,  I  think,  because  the  data  called  for  was  not  commonly  known,  and  few 
understood  enough  of  the  subject  to  risk  an  estimate.  Such  a  report  as  this,  to 
be  of  value  requires  some  one  to  travel  and  collect  the  data  on  the  spot."  Prof. 
Denton's  report,  however,  will  be  found  of  interest,  as  it  is  hoped  the  matter  as  a 
whole  may  be. 


88  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 


THE   EASTERN    WATERSHED   OF   THE   LOWER   PENINSULA. 

Dividing  on  the  Btraits  of  Mackinac  and  following  the  east  coast  line  of  the 
State  southward,  as  the  Pigeon,  Cheboygan,  Sturgeon,  Rainy  and  Ocqueoc  all 
rising  in  Otsego  and  Montmorency  counties,  and  emptying  into  upper  Lake  Huron. 
At  Alpena  is  Thunder  Bay  river,  with  numerous  branches,  draining  Alpena 
county,  the  eastern  portion  of  Montmorency  and  the  more  northern  portions  of 
Oscoda  and  Alcona  counties.  It  is  an  enduring  stream  being  fed  by  numerous 
lakes  and  affords  many  water  power  sites  of  ten  to  sixteen  feet  fall  each  and  of 
six  hundred  to  one  thousand  horse  power. 

The  powers  are  not  much  developed  for  manufacturing  purposes,  although  there 
are  many  drains  built  for  log  floating.  Of  equal  importance  with  the  last  named 
is  the  Au  Sable  river  which  with  its  branches  chains  the  counties  of  Otsego, 
Crawford,  Oscoda  and  portions  of  Alcona  and  Iosco,  emptying  into  the  lake  at  Au 
Sable.  At  Grayling,  in  Crawford  county,  the  railway  survey  shows  an  altitude  of 
553  feet  above  lake  level,  and  at  Bagley,  in  Otsego  county,  of  703  feet.  This  eleva- 
tion, with  a  stream  of  considerable  volume,  must  afford  an  immense  hydraulic 
force.  The  Pine  river,  a  comparatively  small  stream,  enters  the  lake  a  few  miles 
above  Au  Sable.  Emptying  into  the  north  side  of  Saginaw  bay  are  the  Au  Gres  and 
Rifle  rivers,  both  considerable  streams.  Passing  the  Saginaw  river  and  its  conflu- 
ents, which  are  treated  of  under  the  head  of  the  "Saginaw  Valley,"  a  number  of 
small  streams  enter  Lake  Huron  at  the  upper  point  of  the  "Thumb."  Belle  river, 
rising  in  Lapeer  county,  with  an  elevation  at  Imlay  City  of  248  feet  above  lake 
level  and  with  a  traverse  distance  of  over  forty  miles,  empties  into  St.  Clair  river, 
a  short  distance  below  the  city  of  St.  Clair.  Other  streams  on  the  eastern  slope 
are  treated  under  separate  heads. 

THE  SAGINAW   VALLEY. 

The  Saginaw  Valley  will  be  understood  to  embrace  the  region  of  country  the 
drainage  of  which  finds  its  way  into  Saginaw  bay  through  the  river  of  the  eame 
name.  The  valley  may  be  said  to  have  a  length  of  about  one  hundred  and  forty 
miles  from  Oakland  and  Livingston  counties  on  the  south  to  Roscommon  county 
on  the  north,  where  the  Tittabawassee  river  approaches  nearly  to  Houghton  lake, 
the  main  source  of  the  Muskegon  river  which  flows  in  the  opposite  direction.  The 
valley  has  a  breadth  nearly  equal  to  its  length  from  the  head  waters  of  the  Cass 
river  in  Huron  county  to  the  eastward  to  a  point  where  the  Chippewa  becomes  a 
near  neighbor  to  the  Muskegon  in  Osceola  county  on  the  west.  The  Saginaw 
river  proper  is  a  short  stream,  scarcely  more  than  twenty  miles  in  length,  and  it 
is  formed  by  the  junction  of  the  Cass,  Shiawassee  and  Tittabawassee  rivers,  the 
latter  also  receiving  the  waters  of  the  Chippewa,  Pine  and  Tobacco  rivers.  The 
Saginaw  itself  affords  no  water  power. 

John  Larkin  of  Midland,  Hon.  B.  W.  Huston  of  Vassar,"  Thomas  D.  Dewey  of 
OwoBso,  Hon.  J.  W.  Begole  of  Flint,  and  J.  K.  Tisdall  of  Davisburg,  furnished 
the  information  under  this  head. 

The  Tittabawassee  river  rises  in  Roscommon  county  and  is  more  than  a  hundred 
miles  in  length  as  the  river  runs.  At  its  source  the  elevation  above  the  lake  level  is 
nearly  400  feet.    The  river  is  navigable  for  small   craft   as  far  up  as  Midland  city,

some  30  miles  from  its  mouth,  and  was  so  used  up  to  1861,  since  which  time  it  has 
been  used  only  for  log  running  and  storage.  The  fall  below  Midland  city  is  only 
some  ten  feet,  affording  no  water  power.  From  a  considerable  distance  above  Mid- 
land the  river  to  its  mouth  is  250  to  300  feet  wide,  with  an  average  summer  depth  of 
two  to  three  feet.  Above  the  confluence  of  the  Chippewa  the  average  depth  is  one- 
half  to  two  feet.  There  are  available  but  unimproved  water  power  sites  the  entire 
length  of  the  river  above  Midland  every  ten  or  twelve  miles. 

The  Chippewa  rises  mainly  in  Clare  county,  runs  south  and  east  through  Isabella 
into  Midland  county  and  has  a  traverse  distance  of  fully  100  miles  until  it  empties 
into  the  Tittabawassee  at  Midland.  It  ranges  in  width  from  100  to  150  feet,  with  a 
summer  depth  at  its  mouth  of  one  and  one-half  to  two  feet.  There  is  a  fine  water 
power  in  operation  at  Mt.  Pleasant  in  Isabella  county  and  there  are  available  sites 
at  short  distances  its  entire  course.  The  elevation  above  lake  level  at  the  source  of 
the  Chippewa  is  400  to  450  feet.  The  Pine  river  rises  in  Mecosta  county,  makes  a 
southern  detour  into  Gratiot  and  Montcalm,  and  discharges  into  the  Chippewa  near 
its  mouth.  There  are  fine  water  power  improvements  at  St.  Louis  and  Alma,  in 
Gratiot  county.  The  river,  as  to  its  length,  volume  and  water  power  capacity,  is 
about  the  same  as  the  Chippewa.  The  Tobacco  river  rises  in  Clare  county,  has  a 
flow  of  50  to  75  mfres,  passes  through  the  southwest  corner  of  Gladwin  county  and 
empties  into  the  Tittabawassee  near  the  north  line  of  Midland,  and  affords  a  num- 
ber of  available  water  power  sites.  Dams  have  been  built  on  all  of  the  four  streams 
as  aids  to  log  driving  in  low  water,  so  that  the  sites  are  but  little  used  for  mill 
purposes.  The  streams  drain  near  4,000  square  miles  and  are  fed  from  springs  and 
beautiful  clear  lakes,  the  latter  mainly  in  Clair,  Isabella,  Roscommon  and  Gladwin 
counties. 

Cass  river  rises  in  Sanilac  county,  runs  southeast,  and  empties  in  Saginaw  river. 
It  is  fed  by  springs  and  small  streams.  There  is  improved  water  power  at  Vassar, 
in  Tuscola  county,  and  at  Frankenmuth,  in  Saginaw  county,  with  six  feet  fall  and 
100  horse  power  at  Vassar.  There  are  eligible  sites  at  Tuscola  and  at  Wahjamega, 
both  in  Tuscola  county,  that  were  formerly  improved,  but  the  dams  have  been 
washed  away  and  they  are  not  now  used.  The  river  has  a  descent  of  61  feet  from 
Vassar  to  its  mouth. 

The  Shiawassee  river  rises  partly  in  Oakland  and  partly  in  Livingston  county, 
and  has  a  northward  course  of  50  to  60  miles.  It  is  fed  by  springs  and  lakes. 
There  is  improved  power  of  fourteen  to  16  feet  fall  at  Davisburg  and  Holly  in  Oak- 
land county.  In  Shiawassee  county  there  is  improved  power  at  Byron,  Nogs  Bridge, 
Newburg,  Shiawassee  Town,  Roberts  Mills,  Corunna  and  New  Haven. 

During  summer  the  water  supply  is  limited  and  the  dam  at  Owosso  has  for  some 
years  been  disused  for  this  reason.  At  other  seasons  the  volume  of  water  is  ample. 
The  altitudes  above  the  lake  level  are:  Davisburg,  377  feet:  Holly,  356;  Corunna, 
194;  Owosso,  163. 

Flint  river  is  one  of  the  most  important  of  the  single  confluents  of  the  Sag- 
inaw. It  has  its  source  in  four  small  lakes  in  Lapeer  county,  giving  it  a  perma- 
nent and  comparatively  full  volume  of  water,  though  the  supply  is  somewhat 
limited  in  summer.  It  is  a  remarkably  crooked  stream,  making  first  northward 
some  twenty  miles  then  southward  by  a  zigzag  course  through  Genesee  county 
half  the  distance  and  then  northwestward  to  the  Saginaw.

90  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

The  first  power  in  Genesee  county  is  the  Genesee  mills,  flouring,  ten  miles 
above  the  city  of  Flint,  with  a  fall  of  eight  feet.  There  are  within  the  corporate 
limits  of  Flint  a  flouring  mill  with  a  capacity  of  100  barrels  of  flour  per  day 
(besides  custom  work)  and  a  large  paper  mill.  The  Thread  river,  which  comes 
in  at  Flint,  formerly  carried  a  300-barrel  flouring  mill,  which  was  recently  burned^ 
Three  miles  below  Flint  is  a  100-barrel  flouring  mill,  and  at  Flushing,  ten  miles 
below,  a  200-barrel  mill.  The  head  at  these  sites  is  from  7  to  10  feet.  The 
altitudes  above  lake  level  are,  Lapeer  243  feet,  Flint  233.  Farmers  and  Kearsley 
creeks  are  tributaries  of   the  Flint  river,  each   affording  water  power   sites. 

WATER   POWER    OF   OAKLAND   COUNTY. 

With  no  large  rivers  passing  through  it,  the  county  of  Oakland  yet  holds 
within  herself  an  immense  hydraulic  force,  while  she  gives  rise  to  streams  that 
expend  their  force  in  different  directions  in  other  counties.  The  county  is  really 
the  divide  from  which  flows  the  Huron  to  the  southwest,  the  Shiawassee  to 
the  north,  the  Clinton  to  the  east  and  the  Rouge  to  the  south. 

The  divide  as  to  the  three  first  named  rivers  embraces  but  a  small  radius, 
with  its  center  near  the  village  of  Clarkson,  with  an  elevatioft  of  356  feet  above 
lake  level.  There  also  flows  northward  from  the  same  divide  the  Kearsley  creek, 
which  empties  into  the  Flint  river,  and  furnishes  a  power  at  Ortonville  in  Oak- 
land county  and  at  points  in  Genesee  county.  The  number  of  lakes  in  the 
county,  large  and  small,  is  variously  estimated  at  250  to  400  and  are  unfailing 
feeders  to  these  rivers. 

The  rivers  named,  except  the  Clinton,  are  mentioned  under  the  proper  heads. 
The  Clinton,  being  so  largely  an  Oakland  county  stream,  is  included  under  this 
head. 

The  Shiawassee  river  affords  power  at  Holly  and  Davisburg  in  Oakland 
county  and  the  Huron  at  Commerce  and  Milford.  The  Rouge  also  affords  sev- 
eral small  powers  in  the  county.  Pettibone  creek  is  a  small  stream  about  eight 
miles  long,  rising  in  a  lake  in  the  town  of  Highland,  passing  through  a  chain 
of  lakes  and  emptying  into  the  Huron  at  Milford  village.  It  has  a  fall  of 
about  a  hundred  feet  in  the  eight  miles.  It  furnishes  two  powers  of  20  feet  fall 
and  .30  horse  power,  each  in  Highland  township,  one  of  18  feet  fall  and  40 
horse  power  at  Commerce  village,  and  three  at  Milford  of  10,  20  and  23  feet, 
and  15  to  40  horse  power  each.  At  the  village  of  Orion,  near  the  northeast 
corner  of  the  county,  is  a  unique  water  power  forra^ed  by  throwing  a  dam  across 
a  small  stream,  Paint  creek,  at  the  foot  of  a  cluster  of  small  lakes,  throwing 
the  lakes  into  a  common  pond  covering  some  1,600  acres,  dotted  with  a  number 
of  islands,  the  largest  containing  some  30  acres.  The  extent  of  the  water  sur- 
face gives  a  steady  flow  little  affected  by  drouth.  The  power  carries  a  large 
flouring  mill  at  Orion  with  13  feet  fall,  and  another  a  mile  below  with  22  feet 
fall.  Some  five  miles  southeast  from  Orion,  at  Goodison's,  the  same  stream 
carries  another  flour   mill,  and   supplies  another  power   also   at  Rochester. 

At  Ithaca,  in  Macomb  county,  is  a  fine  power  furnished  by  the  Old  Clinton 
and  Kalamazoo  canal,  the  water  for  which  comes  from  the  Oakland  county 
reservoirs. 

The  Clinton   river  has  its  rise  in  two  branches,  one  in  the  township  of  Inde- 


Rivers  and  Water  Powers  in  Michigan.

pendence  and  the  other  in  the  township  of  Springfield,  Oakland  county.  It  trav- 
erses nearly  the  entire  width  of  Oakland  county  and  runs  through  three  townships 
in  Macomb  county,  and  empties  into  Lake  St.  Clair,  four  or  five  miles  below  Mt 
Clemens.  It  passes  over  a  land  surface  of  about  fifty  miles,  although  describing  a 
water-course  much  greater. 

It  is  fed  by  a  chain  of  lakes  until  it  reaches  Pontiac.     It  affords  about   a  dozen 
sites  for  water  power,  as  follows:

THE   BLACK   RIVER. 

This  river  rises  in  two  branches,  the  north  branch  in  Sanilac  and  the  south 
branch  in  Lapeer  county.  It  is  a  very  crooked  stream  and  enters  St.  Clair  river 
at  Port  Huron.  The  following  figures  are  compiled  from  information  furnished 
by  J.  L.  Paldi,  civil  engineer,  and  the  Hon.  W.  L.  Bancroft:

THE   HURON   RIVER. 

There  are  few  streams  carrying  the  volume  of  water  that  the  Huron  does  that 
furnish  so  large  an  amount  of  water  power.  It  has  its  direct  rise  in  Oakland 
county,  among  the  numerous  lakes  of  that  region,  and  receives  an  accession  at 
Milford    through    the   Pettibone  creek,   which    also    drains    a    chain   of    lakes    and 


92  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

affords  some  water  power  at  Milford,  and  at  other  points  in  Oakland  county, 
which  are  noted  under  that  head.  Below  Milford  the  Huron  passes  through  a 
corner  of  Livingston,  and  thence  into  Washtenaw  county,  draining  in  its  course  a 
number  of  lakes.  The  largest  of  which  is  Portage  lake,  near  the  south  line  of 
Livingston  county.  The  elevation  above  lake  level  at  this  point  is  about  two  hun- 
dred and  eighty  feet.  The  lake  area  is  estimated  at  iifty  square  miles,  and  the 
watershed  (by  census  report  of  1880)  at  nine  hundred  and  fifty  square  miles. 
Passing  out  of  Washtenaw  county  below  Ypsilanti  into  Wayne,  the  river  reaches 
Lake  Erie  a  few  miles  below  the  mouth  of  the  Detroit  river.  The  Huron  passes 
through  a  land  surface  measuring  about  seventy  miles,  but  its  river  course  cannot 
be  estimated  at  less  than  one  hundred  miles,  and  may  considerably  exceed  that. 
The  river  was  navigable  for  small  craft  as  far  up  as  Ypsilanti  in  the  earlier  days, 
but  the  railway  connection  with  that  place  and  the  building  of  dams  below  it 
closed  it  for  transit  purposes.  The  water  power  below  Portage  Lake  amounts  to 
sixteen  or  eighteen,  with  horse  power  from  sixty  to  six  hundred,  in  all  about  two 
thousand  three  hundred  horse  power.  Mill  creek,  a  small  stream  comes  in  at 
Dexter  with  twelve  feet  fall  and  about  fifty  horse  power,  furnishing  power  for  a 
flour  mill;  and  at  Ann  Arbor  a  spring  brook  from  the  westward  furnishes  power 
for  a  small  machine  shop  and  a  flour  mill,  and  another  small  stream  from  the 
east  supplied  a  small  flour  mill. 

Col.  H.  S.  Dean  of  Ann  Arbor,  who  supplied  the  information  above  in  connec- 
tion with  Thomas  Beckett  writes:  "The  course  of  the  river  through  the  numerous 
lakes  affords  much  beautiful  scenery,  the  wildness  of  some  of  the  lakes  (and  sur- 
roundings), being  almost  beyond  belief  in  counties  as  long  settled  as  Oakland, 
Livingston  and  Washtenaw.  From  Unadilla  to  Milford  one  may  pass  in  a  small 
boat  from  lake  to  lake,  through  one  portion  of  the  Huron  to  another  a  distance  of 
many  miles,  through  constantly  changing  scenery.  This  region  is  each  year  becom- 
ing more  of  a  pleasure  resort,  and  numerous  club  houses  and  cottages  are  being 
erected  on  the  shores  of  the  various  lakes.  The  whole  course  of  the  river  is  very 
irregular  and  winding.  The  Michigan  Central  railroad  crosses  it  fifteen  times 
between  Dexter  and  Ypsilanti,  a  distance  of  seventeen  miles. 

RIVER  ROUGE. 

This  is  a  small  stream,  but  with  a  descent  of  nearly  two  hundred  feet  to  the 
lake  level  in  a  distance  of  less  than  forty  miles,  it  affords  a  valuable  power.  It 
has  two  branches,  both  rising  in  Oakland  county.  One  branch,  rising  in  Bloom - 
field,  affords  five  small  powers,  namely:  Morris'  grist  mill  (unused),  W.  H.  Smith's 
saw  and  cider  mill,  two  and  two  and  one-half  miles,  respectively,  north  of  Bir- 
mingham, Birmingham  flour  mill,  Erity's  flour  and  saw  mill  two  miles  south  of  Bir- 
mingham, and  the  Southfield  flour  mill.  The  other  branch  springs  from  Walled 
lake,  in  the  township  of  Commerce.  The  course  of  the  stream  is  southeasterly 
until  it  empties  into  the  Detroit  river  four  miles  below  the  city.  It  is  fed  in  addi- 
tion to  its  lake  source  by  springs  and  small  streams,  and  has  an  estimated  water 
shed  of  three  hundred  and  sixty  square  miles.  It  affords  power  in  addition  to 
above  for  five  establishments  of  from  twelve  to  forty-five  horse  power  each. 

C.  B.  Crosby,  of  Plymouth,  and  A.  Partridge,  of  Birmingham,  supply  informa-

THE    RIVER   RAISIN. 

This  important  milling  stream  of  southeastern  Michigan  has  its  rise  in  Jackson, 
Lenawee  and  Hillsdale  counties.  It  drains  the  greater  part  of  Lenawee,  the  south- 
eastern portion  of  Jackson,  northeastern  part  of  Hillsdale,  and  southwestern  part 
of  Washtenaw,  and  traverses  the  width  of  Monroe  county  to  its  mouth  on  lake 
Erie,  a  short  distance  below  the  city  of  Monroe.  For  the  information  regarding 
this  stream  and  its  water  power  capacity  the  compiler  is  indebted  to  Andrew 
Spalding  and  J.  Robison,  of  Manchester.  From  their  report  the  following  facts

In  transmitting  his  report  of  power  below  Adrain,  Mr.  Spalding  says:  "I  have 
submitted  my  report  to  various  mill  men  and  they  all  say  that  it  is  below  the 
actual  capacity  of  the  stream." 

THE   WESTERN  WATER   SHED   OF   THE   LOWER    PENINSULA. 


Up  the  eastern  shore  of  Lake  Michigan  are  three  streams  called  Black  river,  the 
first  with  three  important  branches  emptying  at  South  Haven,  the  second  at  Black 
lake,  and  the  third  at  Crimea.  The  first  of  these  furnishes  small  powers  at  Breds- 
ville,  Bangor,  Jerico,  and  at  two  or  three  other  points  in  Van  Buren  county.  The 
White  river  rises  near  the  center  of  Newaygo  county,  passes  through  a  corner  of 
Oceana  into  Muskegon  county,  and  empties  into  White  lake,  an  arm  of  Lake  Michi- 
gan, at  Whitehall  and  Montague.  Its  descent  from  source  to  mouth  is  estimated  at 
two  hundred  to  two  hundred  and  fifty  feet.  It  has  developed  water  powers  at 
Whitecloud,  Alleyton,  iEtna  and  Hesperia  in  Newaygo  county.  The  Pentwater 
river  enters  Lake  Michigan  at  Pentwater,  the  Big  Sable  at  Point  Sable,  and  the 
Manistee  at  Manistee.    The  Betsie  river  traverses  portions  of  Benzie  and   Manistee 


94  Michigan  and  its  Kesoueces. 

counties  and  empties  into  Lake  Michigan  at  Frankfort,  affording  a  water  power  at 
that  point.  The  Platte  river  enters  the  lake  some  miles  above,  but  its  water  power 
capacity  is  unknown.  The  Bear  river,  Rapid  river  and  Bear  creek  find  their  way 
into  the  waters  of  Traverse  bay  at  various  points  and  the  Maple  river  empties 
into  the  Straits  of  Mackinaw. 

THE    ST.   JOSEPH    VALLEY. 

The  St.  Joseph  river  drains  the  southern  tier  of  counties  in  Michigan  from  Hills- 
dale county,  where  it  has  its  rise,  westward  to  Lake  Michigan.  Within  a  small 
radius  from  where  the  corners  of  Lenawee  and  Hillsdale  join  Jackson  county,  is 
an  elevation  of  nearly  four  hundred  feet  above  lake  level,  from  which  flows  the 
St.  Joseph  river  to  the  west,  the  Kalamazoo  and  the  Grand  to  the  northwest,  the 
Raisin  to  the  east  and  the  southwest,  and  several  small  streams  southward  into  Ohio. 
The  St.  Joseph  furnishes  power  with  eleven  feet  fall  at  Jonesville,  at  Genesee  mills 
below  Jonesville,  and  at  Litchfield  in  Hillsdale  county.  The  outlet  of  Baw  Beese 
lake  draining  into  the  St.  Joseph  furnishes  a  power  at  the  city  of  Hillsdale.  At 
Union  City  in  Branch  county  the  St.  Joseph  receives  the  waters  of  Coldwater  river, 
on  which  there  are  four  powers  reported;  two  at  Coldwater  city  with  seven  and  one- 
half  and  sixteen  feet  fall,  respectively,  and  one  in  Coldwater  township,  and  one  at 
Hodunk  of  eight  and  nine  feet  fall.  There  are  light  powers  arising  from  creeks  in 
other  parts  of  Branch  county. 

At  Three  Rivers,  in  St.  Joseph  county,  the  St.  Joseph  river  receives  the  waters 
of  the  Portage  and  Rock  rivers.  Three  Rivers  is  an  important  manufacturing 
point,  having  a  combined  water  power  from  the  three  streams  that  meet  there  of 
five  hundred  and  twenty-five  horse  power.  The  Portage  river  has  but  one  power 
and  that  at  Three  Rivers.  The  Rock  river  has  besides  that  at  Three  Rivers  a  fifty 
horse  power  at  Flowerfield  and  Howardsville.  The  St.  Joseph  affords  power  in  St. 
Joseph  county,  in  Park  township,  at  Three  Rivers  and  at  Constantine  of  seventy- 
five,  two  hundred  and  fifty  and  two  hundred  horse  power,  respectively.  At  Niles, 
in  Berrien  county,  there  is  a  fine  power  capacity  not  stated.  From  the  southwest 
corner  of  St.  Joseph  county  the  river  passes  into  the  state  of  Indiana  and  bending 
again  northward  gives  the  name  to  the  flourishing  city  of  South  Bend,  at  which 
point,  and  at  Elkhart  and  Mishawauka,  in  Indiana,  it  affords  valuable  power. 
Returning  to  Michigan  it  flows  through  the  city  of  Niles  and  thence  finds  its  way 
into  Lake  Michigan  at  St.  Joseph  and  Benton  Harbor. 

The  altitudes  above  lake  level  at  the  principal  points  named  above  are:  Hills- 
dale, 513  feet;  Jonesville,  495;  Union  City,  318;  Three  Rivers,  223;  Constantine,  221; 
Niles,  115. 

The  information  under  this  head  is  supplied  by  Hon.  E.  O.  Grosvenor,  of  Jones- 
ville, Hon.  C.  D.  Randall,  of  Coldwater,  and  E.  B.  Linsley,  of  Three  Rivers.  Hon. 
J.  J.  Woodman,  of  Paw  Paw,  supplies  some  statistics  of  the  Paw  Paw  river,  a  trib- 
utary of  the  St.  Joseph,  which  rises  in  Van  Buren  county  and  empties  into  the 
St.  Joseph  near  its  mouth,  being  fed  by  springs,  tributary  streams  and  lakes. 

There  are  five  improved  powers  at  Paw  Paw  with  from  twenty-five  to  fifty-three 
horse  power,  one  at  Watgrvleit  of  six  hundred,  and  one  at  Hartford  with  one  hun- 
dred horse  power,  and  two  unimproved.

THE   KALAMAZOO    RIVER. 

This  important  Michigan  river  rises  in  two  branches  near  the  boundary  line 
between  Hillsdale  and  Jackson  counties  and  runs  diagonally  through  portions  of 
Jackson,  Calhoun,  Kalamazoo  and  Allegan  counties,  emptying  into  Lake  Michigan 
at  Saugatuck.  Its  general  course  gives  it  a  traverse  route  of  about  one  hundred 
and  twenty  miles,  the  stream  measurement,  however,  by  its  windings  being  much 
more.  The  information  regarding  its  tributaries  is  incomplete.  At  the  city  of 
Battle  Creek  the  stream  of  that  name  enters  the  Kalamazoo  from  the  northeast. 
It  affords  a  power  at  Bellevue,  in  Eaton  county,  as  reported  by  Wm.  Merritt,  of 
Battle  Creek,  of  twelve  feet  fall  and  one  hundred  horse  power,  and  at  Verona 
mills,  three  miles  above  Battle  Creek  city,  of  six  feet  fall  and  one  hundred  horse 
power.  The  other  information  under  this  head  is  derived  mainly  from  Geo.  S. 
Pierson,  a  civil  engineer  at  Kalamazoo,  and  Hon.  W.  B.  Williams,  of  Allegan,  and 
the  following  statement  is  made  from  these  sources.  We  have  between  Jackson 
and  Allegan  seventeen  powers  ranging  from  seventy-five  to  three  thousand  horse 
powers,  as  follows:

The  figures  are  necessarily  but  approximations  only.  In  transmitting  his  report 
Mr.  Pierson  says:  "  There  is  still  undeveloped  power  at  Otsego  and  above  Kala- 
mazoo on  the  main  river,  and  at  numerous  points  on  the  tributary  streams." 

The  water  shed  of  the  river  and  its  tributaries  has  an  area  of  about  four  hun- 
dred and  fifty  square  miles.  The  flow  of  the  river  at  Kalamazoo,  October  28,  1880, 
was  567,879,840  gallons  per  day,  which  is  about  the  average  stage  of  the  river  at 
this  point.  The  Hon.  W.  B.  Williams  adds:  "There  is  small  power  at  Mill  Grove, 
on  the  outlet  to  Demerest  lake,  and  at  Pine  Creek,  near  Otsego,  on  a  creek  by 
that  name,  and  also  on  Swan  creek  about  seven  miles  northwest  from  Allegan. 
There  is  also  a  good  water  power  at  Hamilton,  in  Allegan  county,  on  the  Rabbit 
river." 

Persons  familiar  with  the  hydraulics  can  form  some  estimate  of  the  immense 
water  power  afforded  by  the  Kalamazoo  river  by  comparing  the  flow  of  the  river 
as  given  by  Mr.  Pierson  with  the  altitudes  as  given  in  the  table.

the  grand  riyer  valley. 

The  Grand  river  and  its  tributaries  form  one  of  the  most  extensive  water  sys- 
tems in  the  lower  peninsula.  The  Grand  river  itself  traverses  five  counties  from 
its  rise,  near  the  southern  line  of  Jackson  county,  being  northerly  through  Jack- 
son, Lansing  and  Grand  Ledge  to  the  city  of  Ionia,  whence  its  course  is  westward 
to  its  discharge  into  Lake  Michigan  at  Grand  Haven.  Measurements  by  fairly 
straight  lines  the  river  would  have  a  course  of  fully  200  miles,  while  its  windings 
would  give  nearly,  if  not  twice,  that  distance.  Its  drainage  above  Grand  Rapids  is 
computed  to  be  more  than  4,800  square  miles. 

At  Lansing  the  Grand  river  receives  the  water  of  Cedar  river,  at  Portland  the 
Lookingglass  river,  at  Muir  the  Maple,  at  Lowell  the  Plat,  at  Ada  the  Thorn- 
apple,  and  near  Grand  Rapids  the  Rouge  river,  besides  a  number  of  smaller 
streams  at  different  points. 

WATER   POWERS   OF   THE   GRAND    RIVER. 

Water  powers  varying  from  75  to  2,000  horse  power  are  found  at  Leoni,  Mich- 
igan Center,  Liberty,  Summit  and  Jackson,  in  Jackson  county;  Onondaga, 
in  Ingham  county;  Dimondale,  in  Eaton  county;  North  and  South  Lansing,  in 
Ingham  county;  Grand  Ledge,  in  Eaton  county;  Portland  and  Lyons,  in  Ionia, 
and  the  greatest  of  all  at  Grand  Rapids,  in  Kent  county.  Besides  these  the 
tributaries  in  many  cases  furnish  powers  of  from  seventeen  to  three  hundred  horse 
power.  H.  A.  Hayden,  of  Jackson,  gives  the  fall  at  Jackson  at  seven  and  one- 
half  feet,  Onondaga  six,  Eaton  Rapids  eight,  Dimondale  six  and  one-half. 

E.  W.  Sparrow,  of  Lansing,  states  the  fall  at  North  Lansing  to  be  eight  feet, 
and  at  South  Lansing  five  feet.  L.  B.  Townsend,  of  Ionia,  states  the  fall  in  two 
dams  at  Hubbardston,  on  Lookingglass  river,  to  be  eighteen  feet,  and  at  Dixon's 
creek  ten  feet.  The  fall  of  Prairie  creek,  emptying  into  the  Grand  river  at  Ionia, 
in  a  distance  of  about  four  miles,  is  about  forty-one  feet,  making  several  fine 
water  powers  ranging  from  seventeen  to  forty-five  horse  power.  Neal  McMillan, 
of  Rockford,  states  that  from  Child's  Mill  to  Briggs  Reef,  on  Rogers  river,  the 
fall  is  forty  feet,  with  horse  power  from  seventy-five  to  one  hundred  and  seventy- 
five.  On  nearly  all  the  tributaries  emptying  into  Grand  River  there  are  falls 
capable  of  being  utilized  into  powers.  A  very  satisfactory  peculiaritay  of  these 
streams  is  the  even  flow  of  water,  varying  but  little  through  the  year.  Michi- 
gan very  rarely  suffers  inconvenience  from  floods,  there  being  no  mountain  sides 
to  shed  a  deluge  of  water  into  the  valleys  and  streams.  Grand  river  carrying 
off  the  surplus  of  more  than  4,000  square  miles  seldom  gets  out  of  its  banks.  It 
pursues  its  winding  way  from  Jackson  to  Lake  Michigan,  creeping  through  val- 
leys, rolling  over  rapids,  tumbling  over  falls,  meandering  majestically  through 
romantic  scenery,  occasionally  dividing  itself,  forming  beautiful  little  islands,  fre- 
quently deepening  to  make  homes  for  the  finny  tribe,  with  which  it  is  abund- 
antly stocked. 

Fishing  in  Michigan  streams  is  and  always  will  be  pre-eminently  great  sport, 
unlike  fishing  in  canals  and  navigable  streams  where  it  is  about  as  good  one 
place  as  another.  To  catch  fish  you  must  go  where  they  are.  An  Irishman 
speaking  of  the  fishing  in  Michigan  said  it  was  just  as  good  in  one  place  as 
another,  and  a  great  deal  better.

THE   MUSKEGON    RIVER. 

This  is  the  greatest  water  power  river  of  Western  Michigan,  larger  in  its  own 
volume  than  the  Grand  river  except  as  the  latter  approaches  the  lake,  and  but 
for  the  larger  and  more  numerous  confluents  of  the  Grand,  would  rank  first  in 
the  river  systems  of  the  State.  It  rises  in  Higgins  and  Houghton  lakes  in  Ros- 
common county,  passes  through  portions  of  six  counties  and  empties  into  Mus- 
kegon lake  at  Muskegon,  the  latter  being  joined  with  Lake  Michigan  by  a  short 
connecting  strait.  Roscommon  station,  on  the  Michigan  Central  railroad,  within 
the  width  of  a  township  of  the  headwaters  of  the  Muskegon,  according  to  the 
survey,  lies  five  hundred  and  forty-six  feet  above  lake  level,  and  Big  Rapids  lies 
three  hundred  and  thirty-four  feet  above  the  lake.  The  windings  of  the  river 
cover  about  three  hundred  miles  from  head  to  mouth.  Hon.  Michael  Brown,  of 
Big  Rapids,  supplies  the  following   statistics  of  water  power    in  Mecosta   county:

Judge  Brown  adds:  Paris  creek  is  a  short  stream  fed  entirely  by  springs  and 
spring  brooks,  never  failing  as  a  water  power,  and  with  the  large  fall  reported, 
furnishes  a  very  excellent  power. 

Ryan  creek  is  the  outlet  of  two  small  lakes  in  this  county. 

Of  course  the  Muskegon  river  furnishes  by  far  the  largest  amount  of  water  power 
of  any  stream  in  the  county.  I  do  not  believe  that  there  is  a  river  in  the  State 
that  will  equal  it.  The  flow  of  water  is  regular  and  constant,  the  river  never  rising 
more  than  three  feet.  In  fact  the  flow  does  not  vary  so  as  to  cause  any  danger 
whatever  to  dams  and  manufactories.  The  flow  of  water  at  different  points  in 
Mecosta  county  ranges  from  3,800  to  5,800  inches.  At  Newaygo  village  is  a  dam 
with  12  feet  fall  (which  could  be  raised  higher),  giving  a  present  horse  power  of 
1,500,  low  water  run.  Pennoyer  Creek  and  Brooks  creek  both  come  in  at  Newaygo, 
the  former  furnishing  a  75  horse  power  dam  and  the  latter  50  horse  power,  both 
improved.  On  the  Muskegon  river  dam  is  a  large  saw  mill,  flour  mill,  planing  mill 
and  tub  and  pail  factory.  On  Pennoyer  creek  is  a  furniture  factory,  and  on  Brooks 
creek  a  flour  mill.  Below  Croton  there  is  a  heavy  fall  in  the  Muskegon  where  a 
30-foot  head  could  be  obtained.  At  Bridgton,  below  Newaygo,  there  is  also  a  fall 
which  could  be  developed. 

It  is  said  that  by  building  a  dam  at  Muskegon  a  head  of  16  feet  could  be  had, 
giving  over  20,000  horse   power.    Other   statistics  of   the  Muskegon  and    its  tribu- 
taries are  wanting,  but  from  those  given  above  some  estimate  can  be  found  of  the 
value  of  this  stream  for  hydraulic  uses.

mason  county. 

George  N.  Stray  and  John  L.  Woodruflf,  of  Ludington,  write  of  the  water  power 
in  Mason  county:  Lincoln  river  is  fed  by  a  lake  three  miles  by  one-half  mile  in 
extent  and  has  a  water  shed  of  about  3  by  15  miles.  It  affords  an  80  horse  power 
site  two  miles  north  of  Ludington.  Hamlin  river  has  a  lake  reservoir  of  10  square 
miles  and  a  water  shed  of  150  square  miles,  and  7  miles  north  of  Ludington  has  a 
160  horse  power  site.  The  powers  on  the  two  rivers  have  been  used,  but  are  not 
now.  Baldwin,  Kinnie  and  Weldon  creeks,  tributaries  of  the  Pere  Marquette,  have 
improved  powers  in  Mason  county,  and  the  Sweetwater,  Winnippesogee,  Beaver 
and  Cedar  creeks  are  susceptible  of  improvement.  Also  the  middle  and  south 
branches  of  the  Pere  Marquette. 

WATER   POWER   AT   THE   SAULT   STE.   MARIE. 

The  fall  or  rapid  at  the  foot  of  Lake  Superior  is  known  by  the  French  desig- 
nation of  the  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  which  takes  the  briefer  and  more  familiar  form 
of  the  Soo.  John  G.  Stradley,  of  the  city  of  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  writes  of  the  possi- 
bilities of  the  water  power  at  that  point. 

In  the  fall  of  1890  a  survey  of  the  river  St.  Marys  was  made  to  ascertain  the 
actual  flow  of  water  over  the  rapids.  The  amount  per  second  is  over  100,000 
cubic  feet,  and  the  estimated  horse  power  is  so  near  300,000  that  it  is  fixed  at 
that  figure  for  the  whole  river.  The  river  being  an  international  boundary  line 
the  Canadians  would  probably  be  entitled  to  one-half  of  the  power  if  they  saw  fit 
to  develop  it.  The  full  flow  of  the  river  can  be  used  for  power,  less  the  amount 
required  to  operate  the  locks  in  the  ship  canal.  The  length  of  the  rapids  is  about 
three-quarters  of  a  mile,  and  the  fall  eighteen  and  one-half  feet.  If  little  rapids 
is  included,  the  fall  will  be  about  twenty  feet.  This  head  can  be  raised  two  and 
one-half  or  three  feet  by  building  a  dam  across  the  head  of  the  rapids,  which 
would  raise  the  entire  of  Lake  Superior.  This  would  make  a  large  increase  in  the 
power  and  is  pronounced  practical  by  both  government  and  civil  engineers,  and 
the  cost  would  be  nominal  compared  with  the  benefits.  A  small  part  of  the  power 
is  already  developed  by  throwing  a  wing  dam  out  into  the  rapids  running  an 
embankment  up  to  the  head.  This  wing  dam  is  only  about  half  way  down  the 
rapids  and  is  called  the  Chandler-Dunbar  water  power.  This  has  nothing  to  do 
with  the  large  water  power  and  does  not  interfere  with  it.  The  plans  for  the 
development  contemplate  a  canal  over  three  miles  in  length,  six  hundred  feet 
wide  and  carrying  eighteen  feet  depth  of  water  its  entire  length.  This  would 
develop  the  largest  water  power  in  the  world,  and  is  so  situated  that  every  mill 
or  factory  built  on  it  can  have  a  train  of  cars  at  one  door  and  the  largest 
steamer  that  runs  the  lakes  at  another.  There  is  no  other  place  on  the  conti- 
nent where  this  can  be  done.  If  the  canal  is  constructed  on  the  plan  contem- 
plated it  will   cost  $5,000,000. 


WATER  POWER  OF  THE  UPPER  PENINSULA. 


BY  PROF.  F.  W.  DENTON,  OF  MICHIGAN  MINING  SCHOOL. 


The  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan  comprises  22,580  square  miles  of  area,  and 
its  topography  may  be  classed  as  rough,  it  being  largely  made  up  of  hills  and 
ridges.  The  shore  along  Lake  Superior  is  steep  and  rocky  throughout,  reaching 
elevations  of  four  hundred  to  six  hundred  feet  above  the  level  of  the  lake  in  dis- 
tance from  the  shore  usually  under  fifteen  miles.  The  main  river  systems  have 
their  sources  near  the  south  side  of  the  northern  range  of  high  land,  and  flow  in 
a  southerly  direction,  approximately  at  right  angles  to  the  south  shore  of  Lake 
Superior,  and  empty  into  Lake  Michigan.  The  peninsula  being  long  and  narrow, 
the  lengths  of  the  watersheds  are  necessarily  very  limited,  and  owing  to  the  numerous 
lesser  ridges  and  ranges  of  hills  running  parallel  to  the  rivers,  the  widths  of  the 
watersheds  are  likewise  very  limited.  In  fact  there  is  but  one  river  in  this  territory, 
which  can  be  said  to  furnish  first  class  water  power,  and  that  is  the  Menominee 
river,  which  is  formed  by  the  junction  of  the  Bois  Brule  and  the  Michigamme 
rivers,  and  flows  southeast  and  empties  into  Green  bay.  The  Menominee  throughout 
its  length  forms  the  boundary  between  the  upper  peninsula  and  the  state  of  Wiscon- 
sin. It  therefore  flows  across  the  base  of  the  peninsula,  thus  draining  a  much 
larger  territory  than  any  other  river  in  this  district.  Its  feeders  in  Michigan  are 
classed  among  the  largest  streams.  Althovigh  the  Menominee  is  the  only  river  that 
furnishes  a  large  amount  of  water  power  there  are  a  number  of  lesser  streams  which 
undoubtedly  furnish  power  which   might  be  economically  used. 

RAINFALL. 

The  late  Professor  Winchell,  in  his  report  upon  the  topography,  climate,  and 
geology  of  Michigan  (1873),  gives  the  following  figures  for  the  upper  peninsula: 

Copper  Falls,  five  years 37.23 

Ontonagon,  twelve      "     24.20 

Marquette,  thirteen    "      31.02 

Sault  Ste.  Marie,  thirty-three  years 30.28 

The  Ontonagon  record   is   exceptionally   low,   and   neglecting  it   as  being  due  to 


100  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

local  or  other  causes,  the  average  of  the  remaining  three  yearly  means  32.84  inches. 
This  record  cannot  be  considered  as  giving  a  fair  average  for  the  whole  upper  pen- 
insula, for  two  reasons.  First,  the  records  were  all  taken  at  the  lake  shore  where 
the  average  precipitation  is  probably  less  than  that  of  the  interior.  Second,  the 
measurement  of  the  snowfall,  which  in  these  latitudes  form  so  large  a  portion  of 
the  total  precipitation  for  the  year,  is  diCBcult  to  determine  accurately.  It  has  not 
been  possible  in  the  limited  time  allowed  for  this  report,  to  investigate  the  rain- 
fall down  to  the  present  time.  The  average  for  the  district  herein  covered  is  prob- 
ably about  32  inches,  and  this  fall  will  be  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  flow  of 
the  streams.  In  the  report  upon  the  water  powers  of  the  United  States,  prepared 
for  the  tenth  census,  the  average  rainfall  taken  for  the  district  is  35  inches.  It  will 
be  seen  from  the  columns  headed  "ratios,  with  the  mean  for  three  months,"  that 
the  precipitation  is  fairly  uniform,  ranging  form  .70  in  the  spring  and  winter  to  1.4 
in  the  autumn.  This,  however,  is  deceptive  since  the  snow  collects  upon  the  ground 
in  the  winter  months,  only  a  small  percentage  reaching  the  streams  at  that  time. 
During  the  thaws  of  the  spring  months  this  snow  rapidly  melts,  producing  freshets. 
The  flow  fluctuates  considerably  as  an  actual  fact  on  this  account,  and  there  are 
usually  two  periods  of  very  low  water,  one  in  summer  and  the  other  in  winter. 
These  conditions  of  small  drainage  areas,  of  small  annual  rainfalls,  and  of  large 
fluctuations  in  the  flow  are  therefore  very  unfavorable  to  the  occurrence  of  first 
class  water  powers.  The  total  fall,  however,  is  as  a  rule  considerable,  the  average 
height  of  the  high  land  which  divides  the  drainage  into  Lake  Superior  and  from 
that  into  Lake  Michigan  being  about  1,500  feet  above  the  sea.  The  level  of 
Lake  Superior  is  600  feet  above  the  sea,  and  therefore  the  main  streams  have 
a  total  fall  of  about  900  feet  in  short  distances.  This  fall  does  not  take  place 
uniformly  as  a  rule,  but  occurs  either  in  the  form  of  rapids  or  natural  waterfalls, 
where  the  streams  cross  the  trap  or  granite  ranges.  The  character  of  the  surface 
varies  in  the  different  parts  of  the  peninsula.  The  average  condition  will  give 
probably  a  flow  in  the  streams,  equivalent  to  sixty  per  cent  of  the  rainfall  upon 
the  respective  watersheds.  The  available  flow  for  the  entire  year  is  estimated  to 
be  twenty  per  cent  of  the  mean  annual  rainfall.  Regarding  the  more  important 
streams  a  few  figures,  which  however  are  only  approximate,  are  given. 

THE   MENOMINEE   RIVER   IN   MICHIGAN. 

(Extracts  from  the  "  Report  apoa  Water  Powers  "  of  the  10th  United  States  Census.) 

Dimensions  of  the  Drainage  Basin. — The  drainage  basin  of  4,113  square  miles 
is  very  irregular  in  outline.  Narrow  at  the  mouth,  it  widens  out  to  an  average 
of  about  40  miles  across,  and  sends  an  arm  away  north,  so  that  the  extreme 
sources  are  within  ten  miles  of  the  waters  of  Lake  Superior  in  Huron  bay.  Thus 
it  nearly  extends  clear  across  the  center  of  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan. 
At  the  nominal  head  of  the  river  it  already  has  a  drainage  area  of  1,769  square 
miles,  for  the  Bois  Brule  and  the  Michigamme  are  each  large  streams.  Further 
down  it  receives  the  Pine  and  Pike  rivers  from  Wisconsin,  and  the  Sturgeon 
and  Little  Cedar  from  Michigan,  besides  numerous  smaller  streams.  No  gaugings 
have  been  made  of  the  river,  but  the  calculations  of  the  water  powers  have 
been  based  upon  a  low  water  flow  of  0.34  cubic  feet  per   second  per  square  mile 


Water  Power  of  the  Upper  Peninsula.  101 

of  watershed,  which  is  equivalent  to  17,8  per  cent  of  the  total  vohime  of 
precipitation,  which  is  here  taken   as  35  inches. 

In  high  water  the  power  of  the  river  is  immensely  increased.  The  river  is 
not  especially  uniform  in  its  flow,  although  running  in  a  timbered  country,  but 
it  cannot  be  considered  an  unsteady  stream,  its  character  being  medium  in  this 
respect.  The  superintendent  of  the  paper  mill  at  the  mouth  said  that  after  a 
heavy  rain  the  river  would  rise  to  a  maximum  in  about  four  days,  stay  at 
that  stage  about  four  days  and  then  fall  to  about  the  usual  level  in  about  four 
days  more. 

Fall  of  the  River. — The  extreme  sources  on  the  west  are  within  two  miles 
of  the  Lac  Vieux  desert,  the  source  of  the  Wisconsin,  which  is  951  feet  above 
Lake  Michigan,  and  on  the  north  they  are  at  least  990  feet  above  Lake  Mich- 
igan, as  Lake  Michigamme  is  952  feet  above  the  level  of  Lake  Superior.  Thus 
the  river  may  be  considered  to  fall  about  975  feet  from  its  source  to  its  mouth, 
in  a  distance  by  water  of  about  160  miles.  This  descent  is  scattered  in  local 
concentrations  all  along  its  course,  and  rapids  characterize  the  river  from  the 
source  to  the  mouth.  The  elevation  of  the  river  at  the  railroad  crossing,  three 
miles  above  the  mouth  of  Pine  river,  is  given  by  the  Chicago  and  Northwestern 
railroad  as  475  feet  above  Lake  Michigan,  and  at  Sturgeon  river  at  the  crossing, 
two  and  one-half  miles  above  the  mouth,  253  feet  above  the  lake. 

From  this  data  the  fall  between  the  railroad  crossing  and  the  mouth  of  the 
Sturgeon  is  approximately  225  feet,  an  average  of  12J^  feet  per  mile.  In  this 
distance  occur  the  Big  and  Little  Quinnesec  falls.  In  the  72  miles  from  the 
mouth  of  the  Sturgeon  river  to  thS  lake,  the  Menominee  falls  about  250  feet, 
an  average  of  three  and  one-half  feet  per  mile.  The  fall  in  these  stretches  is 
not  uniform,  but  occurs  irregularly,  as  rapids  or  waterfalls,  forming  numerous, 
cheap  and  good  water  powers.  Sixteen  principal  rapids  and  falls  are  enumerated 
in  the  census  report,  the  natural  falls  ranging  from  12  to  60  feet.  Among  this 
number  are  two  which  are  classed  under  "  large  undeveloped  water  powers  of 
the  United  States."  They  are  known  as  the  Big  and  Little  Quinnesec  falls. 
Since  the  publication  of  the  census  report,  the  Big  Quinnesec  falls  has  been 
utilized  by  the  Chapin  &amp;  Ludington  Iron  Mining  Company  of  the  Menominee 
Range.  A  large  plant  of  air  compressors,  operated  by  turbins,  is  located  at  the 
falls,  and  the  compressed  air  is  conducted  through  a  large  pipe  to  the  mines 
three  miles  away,  where  it  is  made  to  operate  surface  and  underground  machinery. 

Main  tributaries  of  the  Menominee  in  Michigan:  Michigamme  river,  seventy- 
two  miles,  drains  756  square  miles;  Sturgeon  river,  five  miles,  drains  409  square 
miles. 

MICHIGAMME   RIVER. 

This  is  the  largest  tributary  of  the  Menominee.  Its  drainage  basin  reaches 
nearly  across  the  upper  peninsula,  the  extreme  sources  being  within  ten  miles 
of  the  waters  of  Lake  Superior,  in  Huron  bay.  The  head  of  the  river,  however, 
is  considered  to  be  Lake   Michigamme.  which  is  the  largest  lake  of  the  Menominee 

Note.— This  information  regarding  the  tribataries  of  the  Menominee  river  in  Michigan  is  taken  from 
the  census  report  already  referred  to,  except  that  twenty  per  cent  instead  of  seventeen  and  eight- 
tenths  is  taken  as  giving  the  proportion  of  the  total  annual  rainfall  probably  available  throughout 
the  ye£ir.

basin.  The  length  of  the  river  to  the  extreme  source  is  seventy-two  miles  (map 
measurements),  to  Lake  Michigamme  fifty-one  miles.  The  ordinary  low  stage 
power  at  the  mouth,  under  ten  feet  head,  is  estimated  as  four  hundred  and  six 
theoretical  horse  power,  and  the  average  width  at  the  mouth  is  two  hundred 
and  fifty  feet,  and  at  the  head  eighty  feet.  Lake  Michigamme  is  nine  hundred 
and  eighty  feet  above  Lake  Michigan.  There  are  several  prominent  falls  and 
rapids  on  the  river,  and  all  the  falls  are  over  rock  ledges  with  rocky  banks. 
About  one  thousand  three  hundred  feet  from  the  mouth  is  a  perdendicular  fall 
of  thirty  feet,  with  steep,  rocky  banks.  Four  miles  from  the  mouth  is  another 
vertical  fall  of  six  feet.  Fifteen  miles  from  the  mouth  and  three  miles  below 
the  mouth  of  Deer  river  is  a  vertical  fall  of  ten  feet  over  a  rocky  ledge.  Six  miles 
above  Fence  river  is  Long  Corry  rapids,  one  and  three-quarters  miles  long  with 
about  forty  feet  fall.  Next  there  is  a  fall  and  a  rapid  three  miles  below  Republic 
mine,  three-quarters  of  a  mile  long,  with  about  a  fifteen  feet  fall.  Lake  Michi- 
gamme is  eight  miles  above  this  place. 

STUEGEON   RIVER. 

The  basin  of  this  river  is  in  Michigan. and  its  length  (map  measurements)  to  the 
extreme  source  is  fifty  miles.  The  area  drained  is  four  hundred  and  nine  square 
miles  and  the  power  under  ten  feet  head  at  an  ordinary  low  stage  of  the  water  is 
two  hundred  and  nineteen  theoretic  horse  power.  The  average  width  at  the  mouth 
is  one  hundred  feet.  The  general  course  is  south  southwest,  nearly  at  right  angles 
to  the  general  slope  of  the  country,  and  hence  the  fall  of  the  river  is  very  slight. 
Ten  miles  above  the  mouth  is  a  descent  of  sixteen  feet  in   three  pitches. 

There  are  a  number  of  other  streams  of  about  the  same  importance  as  possi- 
ble sources  of  water  power,  as  the  tributaries  of  the  Menominee  river.  These 
are  tabulated  as  follows:

It  is  impossible  to  give  definite  detailed  information  regarding  these  rivers. 
There  are,  however,  undoubtedly  many  small  water  powers  on  these  and  other 
still  smaller  streams  that  have  not  been  mentioned,  which  can  be  cheaply  utilized. 
The  rivers  fall  irregularly,  forming  rapids  in  some  places  and  abrupt  falls  at 
others.  This  is  shown  by  the  government  plats,  and  also  by  reports  that  have 
been  received  concerning  these  rivers.  The  fall  of  the  streams  through  all  parts 
of    the   upper    peninsula,  with    the  exception  of    those    occurring    on    the   narrow 


Water  Power  of  the  Upper  Peninsula.  103 

stretch  near  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  is  of  a  character  that  permits  of  a  cheap  utiHza- 
tion  of  the  power.  The  factor  wanting  generally  is  not  head,  but  quantity.  The 
difficulty  of  the  lack  of  volume  is  enhanced  by  the  irregularity  of  the  flow, 
caused  by  the  snows  of  winter  melting  rapidly  during  a  short  period  of  time 
in  the  spring.  On  the  other  hand  the  localities  are  often  very  favorable  for 
the  construction  of  cheap  dams,  which  can  be  made  to  impound  the  water  and 
so  regulate  the  flow.  In  conclusion  we  may  say  with  certainty  that  there  exists 
on  the  streams  directly  mentioned,  and  on  numbers  of  others  that  have  not 
been  named,  numerous  small  water  powers  furnishing  from  50  to  200  horse 
power  throughout  the  year,  that  could  be  cheaply  utilized.  A  considerable  num- 
ber are  already  used,  but  the  meager  and  inaccurate  returns  received  do  not 
warrant   an   attempt   at   tabulating   them. 


THE  SOO  WATER  POWER. 


BY  C.   H.   CHAPMAN. 


The  great  water  power  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie  is  at  the  falls  of  the  St.  Mary's  river. 
This  river  is  the  only  known  outlet  for  the  greatest  of  all  bodies  of  fresh  water; 
and  the  assertion  that  this  is  the  greatest  and  best  water  power  in  the  world  is 
occasionally  contradicted  by  those  who  are  unfamiliar  with  the  requirements  for 
good  power.  With  consumers  the  greatest  objection  to  water  powers  are  the  fluct- 
uations in  the  head  or  power  producing  quantity.  On  smaller  streams  the 
spring  freshets  and  summer  droughts  are  serious  obstacles  to  steady  and  even 
power,  such  as  is  required  by  nearly  all  manufactories;  and  steam,  though  much 
more  expensive,  is  frequently  adopted  where  water  power  would  be  utilized  under 
more  favorable  conditions.  The  water  power  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie  has  for  its  direct 
source  of  supply  Lake  Superior,  with  its  thirty-two  thousand  square  miles  of  solid 
water.  The  average  variation  of  the  depth  of  water  in  this  great  lake  is  one  foot 
in  a  year.  The  low  water  season  occurring  in  spring  at  the  time  and  immediately 
following  the  freshets.  From  low  water  mark  in  April  the  lake  gradually  rises  until 
about  September  when  the  highest  point  is  reached,  a  difference  of  but  twelve 
inches.    There  are  some  slight  variations  from  this  rule,  but  it  is  the  average. 

During  the  summer  of  1890,  a  syndicate  was  organized  in  London,  England,  com- 
posed of  English  and  Scotch  capitalists,  for  the  purpose  of  developing  this  great 
power  to  its  fullest  capacity.  Colonel  W.  Hope,  of  the  corps  of  civil  engineers  of 
the  English  army,  visited  Sault  Ste.  Marie  in  the  interests  of  the  syndicate.  He 
remained  several  months  and  completed  a  minute  survey  of  the  falls.  His  charts 
show  the  depth  variation  and  velocity  of  the  water  at  every  point,  and  when  he 
finished,  his  report  to  the  syndicate  was  to  the  effect  that  this  was  the  greatest  and 
most  practicable  water  power  on  earth.  John  Best,  of  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  one  of 
the  largest  and  best  known  contractors  in  Great  Britain  accompanied  Colonel  Hope 
to  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  and  made  a  careful  examination  of  the  entire  locality.  A  few 
months  since,  Mr.  Best  was  visited  at  his  Edinburgh  home  by  ex-general  superin- 
tendent Watson,  of  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  and  Atlantic  Railway,  and  stated  to 
that  gentleman  that  the  water  power  at  the  Sault  was   the   grandest  he  had   ever

seen,  and  the  purchase  and  development   would  have   been  made   by  his  syndicate, 
had  it  not  been  for  the  failure  of  the  Barings  of  London. 

One  of  the  features  of  Colonel  Hope's  plan  of  development  was  to  place  a  dam 
across  the  river  at  the  head  of  the  falls  to  raise  the  water  in  Lake  Superior  and 
hold  complete  control  over  the  head  and  prevent  the  slightest  variation  in  its  flow, 
thus  the  steadiest  known  power  would  have  been  equaled,  if  not  excelled.  This 
plan  was  approved  and  pronounced  practicable  by  the  United  States  corps  of 
engineers.  In  considering  great  water  powers  one's  first  thought  is  of  Niagara 
as  the  greatest,  but  there  the  most  puzzling  problem  with  the  engineers  is,  how 
to  overcome  and  utilize  the  fall.  It  is  too  great  and  no  practical  machinery  will 
stand  the  continuous  strain  of  more  than  twenty-five  foot  of  a  head.  The  head  at 
the  Soo  is  about  twenty  feet  and  the  supply  is  one  never  failing  for  twenty- 
four  hours  a  day  and  three  hundred  and  sixty-five  days  in  a  year.  There  is  now 
completed  here  a  development  of  ten  thousand  theoretical  horse  power.  This  was 
made  quite  easily  and  at  comparatively  small  cost  by  building  a  wing  dam  in 
the  rapids.  The  average  power  at  Minneapolis,  from  the  falls  of  St.  Anthony, 
is  five  thousand  theoretical  horse  power,  while  at  the  Soo  twice  the  amount  i&amp; 
already  developed  and  ten  times  more  is  awaiting  development.

LUMBER  INTERESTS. 


Although  agriculture  is  the  chief  producing  interest  of  this  State,  and  engages 
the  attention  of  the  largest  share  of  its  people,  fertile  farms  and  prolific  orchards 
have  not  alone  contributed  to  its  prosperity.  Noted  for  its  wheat,  its  wool  and  its 
fruit,  it  is  also  the  first  of  the  United  States  in  its  production  of  lumber,  salt, 
charcoal  pig  iron  and  copper,  and  in  the  extent  of  its  fresh-water  fisheries.  Cer- 
tainly first  in  the  value,  and  probably  first  in  the  amount,  of  its  yield  of  iron  ore, 
and  among  the  most  advanced  in  its  general  manufacturing  and  commercial  devel- 
opment. While  a  few  states  excel  it  in  the  volume  of  their  crops,  and  some  in  the 
aggregate  of  their  industrial  statistics,  none  can  equal  it  in  the  magnitude  and 
diversity  of  its  resources,  taken  together.  Its  forests,  mines,  mills  and  factories, 
while  offering  employment  to  all  grades  of  labor,  from  the  unskilled  worker  with 
the  pick  and  shovel  to  the  most  expert  mechanic,  also  create  a  large  and  con- 
stant local  demand  for  the  farm  products  of  the  State,  and  thus  doubly  promote 
the  general  progress.  The  full  extent  of  the  invitation  Michigan  thus  proffers  to 
the  laborer  and  the  artisan  in  search  of  work  and  to  the  farmer  of  small  means 
who  desires  to  purchase  new  lands,  and  to  secure  a  home  market  for  his  sur- 
plus produce,  can  be  best  made  plain  by  brief  accounts  of  the  history  and  con- 
dition  of   its   leading  industries. 

Before  the  ax  of  the  lumberman  commenced  its  work  on  the  forests  of  Michi- 
gan, the  northern  part  of  its  lower  peninsula  surpassed  any  known  region  of  the 
same  area  in  the  richness  of  its  stock  of  timber.  Interspersed  with  the  best 
varieties  of  pine  were  extensive  growths  of  oak,  maple,  beech,  ash,  walnut,  cherry, 
white  wood,  hickory  and  elm,  while  the  less  valuable  cedar,  hemlock,  basswood  and 
tamarack  grew,  in  some  sections,  in  equal  abundance.  In  the  upper  peninsula  and 
northern  part  of  the  lower  peninsula  pine  existed  also  in  large  quantities,  and  broad 
tracts  of  hard  wood  invited  the  erection  of  furnaces  for  the  manufacture  of  the 
best  grades  of  charcoal  iron.  Magnificent  forests  of  hard  timber  covered  the 
greater  part  of  the  southern  counties,  now  so  rich  in  agricultural  w^ealth.  A  more 
■comprehensive  account  of  the  timber  resources  of  the    State  is    printed  on  sue- 


Lumber  Inteeests.  107 


ceeding  pages,  from    the   pen    of    Prof.  W.   J.   Beal,  the    accomplished    botanist  of 
the  Agricultural   College. 

Much  of  the  timber  product  of  the  State  has  been  of  an  exceedingly  superior 
quality.  Its  cork  pine  ranks  among  the  best  of  the  soft  woods,  and  commands 
the  highest  market  price.  Its  common  grades  of  white  and  Norway  pine  are  of 
standard  value,  while  its  harder  woods  are  in  demand  in  the  ship-yards,  factories 
and  cabinet  shops  of  this  and  the  European  continent. 

THE  CHIEF  MANUFACTURING  INTEREST  OF  THE  STATE. 

For  many  years  lumbering  has  been  the  chief  manufacturing  interest  of  Michi- 
gan, and  no  American  state  equaled  it  in  the  extent  and  value  of  its  lumber 
product.  The  State  has  never  collected  and  compiled  the  annual  statistics  of  this 
industry,  and  the  most  trustworthy  sources  of  information  upon  the  subject  are 
the  elaborate  publications  of  journalists  connected  with  papers  representing  that 
interest,  or  issued  at  the  centers  of  the  manufacture.  Even  these  are  deficient  in 
statistics  covering  the  trade  in  spars,  staves,  heading,  and  long  timber,  and  the 
thousands  of  cords  of  fuel  chopped  and  sold  annually  have  gone  unrecorded,  as 
also  have  the  heavy  shipments  of  railroad  ties,  cedar  telegraph  poles,  piles,  pav- 
ing blocks,  spool  stock,  and  hardwoods  for  the  furniture  maker. 

GROWTH   AND    MAGNITUDE   OF   THE   LUMBER   BUSINESS. 

The  history  of  this  great  industry  covers  a  period  of  only  about  thirty  years.  In 
1854  the  Hon.  Wm.  L.  Webber,  of  East  Saginaw,  made  the  first  estimate  of  the 
■extent  of  the  operations  of  Michigan  lumbermen  whose  activity  was  then  chiefly 
confined  to  the  valley  of  the  Saginaw  river.  He  reported  the  existence  of  sixty- 
one  mills,  many  of  them  using  water  power,  and  placed  their  entire  annual  product 
at  but  108,000,000  feet.  Eighteen  years  later,  in  1872,  it  was  estimated  that  the 
lumber  product  of  Michigan  for  twelve  months  included  2,560,000  feet  of  oak 
timber,  12,700,000  staves,  300,000,000  lath,  400,000,000  shingles,  and  2,500,000,000 
feet  of  sawed  pine.  The  number  of  saw  mills  in  the  State  at  that  time  was  about 
fifteen  hundred,  employing  more  that  twenty  thousand  persons,  and  representing 
$25,000,000  of  capital.  There  were  also  two  hundred  shingle  mills  and  eighty  stave 
and  hoop  factories,  with  an  annual  product  of  $4,000,000  in  value.  The  lumber 
trade  suffered  materially  during  the  following  years  of  commercial  depression,  but 
in  1879  the  total  amount  sawed  in  this  State  reached  3,100,000,000  feet,  and  Gov. 
Jerome  in  his  inaugural  message  estimated  the  value  of  the  entire  timber  product 
of  that  year  at  360,000,000.  The  product  of  1881  is  estimated  by  the  lumber  journals 
to  have  been:

This  large  total  is  that  of  sawed  pine  lumber  alone  and  is  exclusive  of  shingles, 
lath,  staves  and  long  timber,  whose  product  possesses  an  annual  value  of  many 
millions.  An  ingenious  calculation  shows  that  the  work  of  the  Michigan  mills 
during  that  year  in  sawed  lumber  would  load  a  train  of  cars  2,470  miles  in  length, 
each  car  carrying  10,000  feet  and  occupying  thirty-three  feet  of  track,  and  would 
build  a  city  of  handsome  frame  houses  capable  of  furnishing  comfortable  homes 
for  more  than  a  million  of  people.  The  aggregate  value  of  the  forest  products  of 
this  State  already  marketed  is  in  excess  of  $1,000,000,000.  These  totals  far  outstripped 
those  of  any  other  timber  producing  state,  or  of  any   country  of   like   area. 

The  production  of  lumber  increased  until  about  1883,  when  it  seemed  to  receive 
a  check.  Many  small  timber  claims  were  worked  up  and  mills  were  idle.  It 
was  then  claimed  by  some  that  the  great  lumber  producing  State  was  weaken- 
ing. The  output  was  visibly  decreased,  but  that  the  pine  timber  was  exhausted 
was  by  no  means  true.  In  1892  the  lumber  production  was,  lumber  3,794,256,754 
and  shingles  2,140,800,000,  and  the  price  much  better.  This  included  hardwood 
lumber,  of  which  there  is  an  immense  amount  in  the  State.  A  large  proportion 
of  the  lumber  produced  in  Michigan  is  being  manufactured  within  the  State- 
and   the  manufactured   articles  shipped   instead   of  raw   lumber. 

THE    GREAT    CENTERS    OF    MANUFACTURE. 

The  distribution  of  the  lumber  manufacture  of  Michigan  is  determined  by  its 
rivers  and  railroads.  Below  the  valleys  of  the  Saginaw  and  the  Grand,  little 
else  than  a  mere  local  trade  now  exists.  The  Saginaw  receives  the  waters  of 
the  Tittabawassee,  the  Cass,  the  Flint,  the  Shiawassee,  the  Bad,  the  Pine,  the 
Chippewa,  the  Tobacco,  and  their  numerous  tributaries,  draining  a  vast  and  mag- 
nificently timbered  region.  At  its  mouth  is  the  thriving  city  of  Bay  City;  six- 
teen miles  above,  at  the  head  of  steam  navigation,  is  Saginaw.  At  these  cities 
and  in  the  flourishing  villages  between  them  are  collected  the  finest  lumber 
manufacturing  establishments  in  the  world,  whose  total  yearly  product  surpasses 
that  of  any  other  single  district.  The  river  which  brings  the  logs  to  their  booms 
also  bears  large  vessels  to  their  docks,  and  they  have  under  absolute  control  all 


Lumber  Interests.  109 


the  advantages  of  cheap  water  transportation.  The  Saginaw  valley  is  also  con- 
nected by  several  first-class  lines  with«the  railway  system  of  the  continent,  and 
with  this  multiplied  outlet   commands  access  to   all   the   markets  of  the   world. 

The  Lake  Huron  shore,  including  Saginaw  bay,  counts  its  saw^  mills  by  the 
hundred.  The  Au  Sable  and  Thunder  bay  are  important  logging  rivers  of  that 
part  of  the  State,  and  lumbering  is  also  extensively  carried  on  along  the  Rifle, 
the  Aux  Gres,  the  Cheboygan,  the  Black,  and  many  smaller  streams.  Alpena, 
Tawas  City,  East  Tawas,  Cheboygan,  Oscoda,  Au  Sable,  Harrisville  and  Black 
River   are  important   manufacturing  or  shipping   points. 

The  chief  lumbering  rivers  emptying  into  Lake  Michigan  are  the  Muskegon, 
the  Manistee,  the  White  and  the  Pere  Marquette.  Many  millions  of  feet  are  also 
cut  annually  along  the  banks  of  the  two  Sables,  the  Aux  Bees  Scies,  the  Pent- 
water,  and  other  lesser  streams.  The  Muskegon,  after  draining  a  broad  valley 
extending  far  into  the  interior,  expands  into  a  handsome  lake  close  upon  the 
shore  of  Lake  Michigan.  No  natural  provision  could  be  more  favorable  for  the 
handling  of  logs  and  the  shipment  of  the  sawed  product,  and  the  city  of  Mus- 
kegon, located  upon  the  south  shore  of  the  lake,  has  the  distinction  of  having 
•annually  cut  more  lumber  than  any  other  single  city  in  the  world.  Manistee 
possesses  a  similar  eminence  in  the  manufacture  of  shingles.  Montague,  White- 
hall, Pentwater,  Ludington,  Frankfort,  Elk  Rapids  and  Traverse  City  also  con- 
tribute  to   swell   the  total   of   the  forest   products  of   the   Lake  Michigan  shore. 

There  are  many  inland  towns,  situated  upon  railway  lines,  which  are  important 
centers  of  this  industry. 

Lumbering  is  yet  in  its  infancy  in  the  upper  peninsula,  but  the  value  of  the 
sawed  and  square  timber  product  of  that  region  in  1881  must  be  estimated  at 
over  $4,000,000.  Saw  mills  are  scattered  along  the  shores  and  the  railways  of 
Menominee,  Delta,  Mackinac.  Marquette,  Schoolcraft,  Baraga,  Houghton  and  Ontona- 
gon counties,  but  the  chief  centers  of  lumber  production  in  that  section  of  the 
State  are  Menominee,  Escanaba,  Manistique,  St.  Ignace,  Ford  River  and  Munising. 

Menominee  is  claimed  to  be  the  greatest  lumber  producing  city  in  the  State 
at  this  time. 


HARDWOODS  IN  NORTHERN  MICHIGAN. 


BY   J.   G.    KAMSDELL,    TBAVEKSE   CITY. 


That  portion  of  the  lower  peninsula  of  Michigan  lying  north  and  west  of  the 
Manistee  river,  and  embracing  the  counties  of  Benzie,  Leelanau,  Grand  Traverse, 
Antrim,  Charlevoix  and  Emmet,  the  west  half  of  Kalkaska,  and  the  north  halves 
of  Manistee,  Wexford  and  Missaukee,  was  originally  covered  with  a  dense  forest 
growth  of  valuable  timber.  Along  the  river  valleys  and  around  the  smaller  inland 
lakes,  pine,  hemlock  and  cedar  were  the  prevailing  timbers.  On  the  high  table 
and  rolling  lands,  around  the  borders  of  the  larger  inland  lakes,  and  along  the 
shore  of  the  great  lake  and  bays,  the  forest  was  composed  of  deciduous  timber, 
interspersed  with  hemlock,  maple  and  elm  being  the  predominating  varieties. 
About  one-tenth  of  the  whole  area  above  described  was  occupied  by  pine  or  cedar, 
covered  with  water  or  was  waste  land.  Of  the  pine  about  one-half  has  been  cut; 
most  of  the  cedar  is  still  standing.  The  other  nine-tenths  were  heavily  timbered 
with  hardwoods  of  uncommon  height  and  size,  of  thrifty  growth  and  excellent 
quality.  This  hardwood  area,  is  mostly  owned  by  actual  settlers;  a  large  quantity, 
however,  is  still  held  by  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroad  and  the  Michigan 
Agricultural  College.  * 

About  one-eighth  of  the  hardwood  lands  have  been  cleared  for  agricultural  pur- 
poses, leaving  seven-eights  of  the  natural  forest  still  standing.  As  this  hardwood 
land  is  all  excellent  farming  land,  in  estimating  the  amount  of  timber  available 
for  manufacturing  purposes,  one-fourth  of  the  hardwood  area  must  be  deducted  for 
farm  reserves.  The  whole  number  of  acres  in  the  territory  under  consideration  is 
about  3,000,000;  deducting  one-tenth  for  pine,  cedar,  water  and  waste  leaves  2,700,- 
030  acres  as  the  amount  of  hardwood  land.  Estimating  one-eighth  of  this  as 
already  cleared  for  agriculture,  leaves  as  the  amount  of  uncut  hardwood  land  2,362,- 
500  acres,  and  deducting  from  this  one-fourth  of  the  whole  hardwood  area  leaves 
2,025,000  acres  of  uncut  hardwood  available  for  commercial  purposes. 

From  evidence  before  me,  recently  taken  in  a  chancery  cause,  where  the  ques- 
tion of  the  amount  per  acre  of  merchantable  deciduous  saw  timber  on  a  certain 
half  section  of  land  in  Benzie  county  became  an  important  factor,  I  find  that  the 
testimony  of  timber  experts  placed  the  estimate  at  8,000  feet  of  merchantable  lum- 


Hardwoods  in  Nokthern  Michigan.  Ill 

ber  per  acre  from  the  deciduous  timber,  6,000  feet  of  which  was  surface  clear;  and 
it  also  showed  that  the  half  section  in  question  was  a  fair  average  of  the  hard- 
wood lands  in  this  region.  This  estimate  would  make  the  amount  of  deciduous 
merchantable  saw  timber  1,620,000,000  feet.  Nine-tenths  of  this  is  maple  and  elm, 
and  the  rest  is  beech,  basswood,  birch,  ash  and  red  oak  in  the  order  named.  The 
foregoing  estimate  I  consider  too  high;  I  would  place  the  total  at  about  1,500,000,- 
000  feet  of  deciduous  timber  available  for  lumber. 

I  have  consulted  experts  in  the  cordwood  business,  and  they  estimate  the 
amount  of  timber  available  for  charcoal  wood,  remaining  after  the  saw  timber  is 
taken  out,  from  twenty-five  to  thirty-five  cords  per  acre.  Taking  the  mean  of 
thirty  cords  would  give  60,750,000  cords  that  might  be  utilized  for  that  purpose; 
enough  to  manufacture  25,000,000  tons  of  charcoal  pig  iron,  or  enough  to  furnish 
fifty  charcoal  furnaces  of  an  average  annual  capacity  of  20,000  tons  for  twenty- 
five  years. 

In  making  these  estimates  no  account  is  made  of  hemlock,  which  is  interspersed 
among  all  classes  of  timber  and  is  valuable  for  both  tan  bark  and  lumber.  The 
quantity  is  large,  and  for  the  whole  region  might  be  safely  placed  at  one-tenth 
as  much   as  the  hardwood. 

Of  the  territory  embraced  in  the  foregoing  estimates,  about  twenty-two  town- 
ships are  directly  tributary  to  the  head  of  Grand  Traverse  bay  as  its  natural 
outlet,  the  artificial  outlet  over  the  four  railroads  centering  at  Traverse  City 
greatly  enlarging  the  advantages  of  manufacturing  at  that  place.  There  are  but 
two  charcoal  furnaces  in  the  whole  region  and  consequently  a  large  portion  of 
the  pharcoal  timber  left  after  the  removal  of  the  saw  timber  goes  to  waste.  The 
vast  amount  of  this  timber  is  to  be  had  for  the  cost  of  cutting  and  transporta- 
tion, the  short  and  cheap  water  freight  from  the  ore  docks  of  Escanaba  and  St. 
Ignace,  and  the  abundance  of  lime  for  flux  cropping  out  in  ledges  on  Grand 
Traverse  bay  should  at  once  attract  the  charcoal  iron  manufacturers  of  the 
United  States  to  this  region,  as  combining  advantages  for  this  industry  unequaled 
elsewhere,  and  suggesting  an  economy  of  production  that  would  defy  all  compe- 
tition   in  the  production  of   charcoal   iron. 

The  Onondaga  salt  formation  underlies  this  whole  territory  at  a  depth  of  from 
1,200  to  1,800  feet  below  the  level  of  Lake  Michigan.  This  formation  has  a 
stratum  of  pure  rock  salt  from  thirty  to  three  hundred  feet  in  thickness.  The 
late  Prof.  Alexander  Winchell,  state  geologist  for  Michigan,  in  his  report  of  this 
region  estimated  the  depth  of  boring  to  reach  the  salt  rock  at  the  head  of  Grand 
Traverse  bay  at  about  1,200  feet. 

No  attempt  has  been  made  to  test  the  accuracy  of  Prof.  Winchell's  survey  at 
this  place,  The  business  men  of  Traverse  City  and  vicinity  have  become  impressed 
with  the  great  advantages  which  the  production  of  salt  would  be  to  the  hardwood 
manufacturing  interest  and  incidentally  to  all  other  business,  and  are  taking  steps 
to  test  the  geological  prediction  referred  to.  Undoubtedly  within  the  next  six 
months  the  matter  will  be  definitely  determined  by  the  sinking  of  a  well.  Should 
the  salt  rock  be  reached  by  such  boring,  the  advantages  of  Traverse  City  and 
vicinity  for  working  up  the  vast  quantity  of  hardwood  in  the  northwest  portion 
of  the  lower  peninsula  of  Michigan  from  stump  to  finish  will  be  unequaled.  For 
those  who  desire  to  enter   into  any  branch  of  the   hardwood  industry,   the  forests 


112  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

of  northwestern  Michigan  afford  the  most  abundant  supply  of  excellent  timber  of 
any  portion  of  the  United  States.  Its  railroad  facilities  and  numerous  lake  ports 
give  superior  advantages  in  the  matter  of  freight.  The  numerous  well  tilled 
farms  scattered  through  the  region  aflPord  an  abundance  of  cheap  and  excellent 
provisions  for  the  household,  and  the  free  school  system  gives  the  best  educa- 
tional advantages  to  working  men's  children.  Capacious  and  well  furnished  school 
houses  are  found  in  every  neighborhood.  The  leading  denominations  have  erected 
churches  in  all  the  villages,  and  many  out  among  the  farmers  where  villages  are 
distant,  and  keep  their  pupils  well  supplied  with  an  able  and  earnest  ministry.  In 
this  country  the  new  and  old  are  most  fortunately  blended;  the  new  in  the  advant- 
age of  cheap  raw  material,  and  the  old  in  all  the  advantages  of  modern 
improvements. 


THE  BROAD-LEAVED  TREES  OF  MICHIGAN. 


BY    W.   J.   BEAL,    AGRICULTURAL    COLLEGE,    MICH. 


"Hardwood"  is  a  very  indefinite  and  unsatisfactory  term  popularly  employed, 
not  only  to  designate  the  timber  of  oaks,  sugar  maple,  beech,  the  hickories,  etc., 
which  is  truly  hard,  but  that  of  basswood,  whitewood,  butternut  and  cotton  wood, 
which  is  truly  soft.  The  term  at  the  head  of  this  article  is  easily  understood 
by  everyone  and  has  the  advantage,  at  least  so  far  as  Michigan  is  concerned, 
of  being  strictly   accurate  without  exception. 

The  term  "hardwood"  implies  another  term,  "softwood,"  which  is  not  uncom- 
monly employed  to  designate  the  timber  of  white  pine,  Norway  pine,  cedar,  spruce, 
balsam,  etc.  These  are  all  evergreen,  with  narrow  leaves,  but  the  timber  of 
Norway  pine  is  nearly  on  the  dividing  line  between  hardwood  and  softwood,  and 
is  certainly  harder  than  that  of  basswood  and  cottonwood,  which  is  usually 
included  in  the  hardwoods.  Tamarack,  or  larch,  is  not  an  evergreen,  but  is 
nearly  related  in  a  scientific  way  to  the  pines,  cedars  and  spruces.  Instead  of 
the  term  "  softwood "   it  would   be   preferable    to   use  the   term 

CONE-BEARING    OR    PIN-LEAVED    TREES. 

Our  trees  belonging  to  this  list  are  white  pine,  Norway  pine,  jack  pine,  hem- 
lock, black  spruce,  white  spruce,  balsam  fir,  white  (yellow)  cedar,  red  cedar  and 
tamarack. 

Timber  is  relatively  hard  or  soft  nearly  in  proportion  to  its  specific  gravity 
when  dry.  From  the  forest  report  of  the  tenth  census  I  give  the  specific  grav- 
ity of  the  woods  of  some  well-known  trees.  The  heavier  the  wood  the  more 
valuable  it  is  for  fuel,  the  heating  capacity  when  burned  corresponding  very 
closely   to  the   weight:

The  wood  of  the  same  species,  or  closely  allied  species,  is  harder  in  proportion  as 
it  grows  in  a  dry  climate.  For  example,  the  wood  of  white  ash  grown  in  dry  por- 
tions of  Texas  is  twenty  per  cent  heavier  than  that  grown  in  damper  climates,  like 
that  of    Michigan,  while  the  wood  of  black  walnut  is  thirty-three  per  cent  heavier. 

Michigan  once  contained,  by  estimate,  150.000,000,000  feet  of  pine,  board  measure. 
It  is  safe  to  say  seven-eighths  of  this  has  been  cut,  or  in  some  way  destroyed.  Since 
the  petted  '*  rabbit "  has  escaped  it  may  now  be  a  satisfaction  to  quote  the  opinion  of 
Hon.  Perry  Hannah,  that  the  State  would  have  been  better  off  had  she  never  pos- 
sessed a  foot  of  pine,  but  had  possessed  only  hardwoods  instead.  The  reasons 
for  this  statement  are  as  follows:  Pine  often  grows  on  poor  land,  the  dead  leaves 
and  bruRh  and  tops  of  trees  encourage  fires  which  devastate  large  areas,  spreading 
to  living  trees  and  often  beyond,  destroying  fences,  dwellings  and  crops.  The  stumps 
are  durable,  and  troublesome  to  cultivate  among  or  expensive  to  remove.  Desola- 
tion too  often  follows  the  track  of  the  man  who  secures  and  cuts  pine  or  other 
evergreen  trees;  but  where  hardwood  is  cut  cultivated  fields  soon  appear.  Broad 
leaved  trees  are  much  less  liable  to  suffer  from  fire,  or  lead  to  the  spread  of  fires; 
they  more  frequently  grow  on  good  soil,  and  the  stumps  in  a  not  remote  period 
decay  and  disappear,  leaving  good  farms  to  recruit  and  sustain  the  country. 

For  nearly  all  purposes  the  timber  of  some  one  or  more  of  our  numerous  broad 
leaved  trees  is  just  as  good  as  that  of  pine  and  even  better.  Timber  of  white  and 
Norway  pine  is  very  pretty  and  suitable  for  many  purposes,  but  with  it  we  cannot 
acceptably  fill  so  great  a  variety  of  places,  especially  in  unpainted  surfaces,  or 
where  strength  or  durability  is  required,  as  can  be  filled  by  timber  of  our  broad 
leaved  trees.  The  wood  of  many  of  the  latter  trees  is  most  admirable  for  veneers, 
or  for  cutting  in  special  ways  to  show  the  grain  to  the  best  advantage.  The  rea- 
sons why  the  broad  leaved  trees  have  not  been  removed  as  fast  as  the  pine  'are 
these:  The  timber  is  harder  and  heavier,  not  so  easily  worked  and  more  costly  to 
transport.  These  slight  barriers  may  have  been  an  advantage  to  delay  the  rapid 
slaughter  of  this  timber,  which  will  take  the  place  of  pine  when  gone. 

The  main  bulk  of  marketable  timber  of  the  cone-bearing  trees  consists  of  white 
pine,  Norway  pine,  white  (yellow)  cedar,  hemlock,  with  a  little  black  spruce,  white 


The  Broad-leaved  Trees  of  Michigan.  115 

spruce  and  balsam  fir;    while  the  species  of  our  broad  leaved   trees  which  furnish 
timber  in  the  market  are  ten  to  twelve  times  as  great. 

The  sugar  maple  is  perhaps  the  most  generally  distributed  and  the  most  abun- 
dant of  the  native  trees  of  our  State,  while  beech  is  very  widely  distributed, 
red  oak  probably  next.  The  white  oak  is  abundant,  well  known  and  valuable,  but 
disappears  to  the  north  as  we  enter  the  pine. 

If  we  follow  in  nearly  a  direct  line  from  the  lower  point  of  Lake  Huron  across 
the  State  to  the  mouth  of  the  Kalamazoo  river,  in  latitude  a  little  north  of  43 
degrees,  we  will  find  at  the  south,  three  tiers  of  counties  producing  scarcely  any 
other  species  of  trees  than  those  with  broad  leaves;  while  at  the  north,  extend- 
ing into  the  upper  peninsula,  are  mixed  tracts  of  both  classes  of  trees  as  above 
defined.  In  this  northern  region  may  yet  be  found  many  cone-bearing  trees  of 
white  and  Norway  pine,  jack  pine,  hemlock,  white  (yellow)  cedar,  tamarack,  black 
spruce,  white  spruce  and  balsam  fir,  while  intermingled  with  them  or  in  separate 
lots,  are  broad-leaved  trees  as  follows:  Sugar  maple  (including  bird's  eye),  white 
oak,  beech,  American  elm,  (including  gray),  basswood,  rock  elm,  red  oak,  black 
oak,  swamp  white  oak  (usually  classed  with  white  oak),  black  ash,  yellow  birch, 
red  maple  (one  of  the  soft  maples),  silver  maple  (another  soft  maple),  hackberry, 
butternut,  bitternut,  canoe  birch,  black  birch,  aspen,  balm  of  gilead,  black  cherry, 
white  ash,  hickory,  ironwood,  burr-oak  and  scarlet    oak. 

In  the  region  including  the  southern  three  tiers  of  counties  spoken  of,  the 
number  of  species  of  broad-leaved  trees  is  much  increased,  though  in  many 
counties  this  is  all  needed  to  supply  the  wants  of  the  people  living  in  the 
vicinity.  In  this  southern  region  may  be  found  white  oak,  swamp  white  oak, 
red  oak,  burr-oak,  chestnut  oak,  black  oak,  beech,  sugar  maple,  black  maple,  red 
maple,  silver  maple,  basswood,  black  ash,  white  ash,  red  ash,  blue  ash,  sycamore, 
American  elm,  rock  elm,  red  elm,  hackberry,  mulberry,  tulip  tree,  black  cherry. 
Kentucky  coflfee  tree,  honey  locust,  downy  thorn,  dogwood,  pepperidge,  sassafras, 
black  walnut,  butternut,  shagbark  hickory,  western  shellbark  hickory,  small 
fruited  hickory,  mockernut,  pignut,  bitternut,  black  birch,  black  willow,  aspen, 
large  toothed  aspen,  Cottonwood,  downy  poplar,  balsam  poplar,  red  cedar,  black 
spruce,  tamarack,  and  rarely  a  few  trees  of  white  pine,  hemlock  and  jack  pine. 
In  all,  native  to  the  State,   there  about  seventy  kinds  of  trees. 

Michigan  has  for  a  long  time  taken  first  rank  among  the  northern  central 
states  for  the  value  of  her  lumber  product,  and  it  is  evident  from  the  foregoing 
statements  she  must  long  hold  a  prominent  place.  But  with  the  increased  popu- 
lation of  the  State  and  surrounding  states,  greater  inroads  must  be  made  on 
our  forests.  With  improved  modes  of  cutting  and  transporting  this  timber,  it 
must  go  more  rapidly  than  did  the  pine.  As  it  takes  a  long  time  to  grow  a  crop 
of  timber,  it  stands  us  in  hand  to  husband  our  present  supply,  using  it  all  to 
best  advantage,  taking  some  pains  to  save  unmolested  in  suitable  places  the 
groves  of  young  trees  already   coming  on  to   supply   the   demands  of   the  future. 

Hewing  farms  out  of  the  forest,  here  and  there,  let  in  the  winds  and  other- 
wise disturbed  the  natural  condition  of  things.  One  of  the  consequences  most 
apparant  was  the  decay  of  trees  at  the  top;  slowly  at  first,  but  more  and  more 
apparent  as  more  trees  in  the  neighborhood  were  hewn  down.  There  is  no  hope 
of  reviving  such  trees;  they  must  be  cut,  the  sooner  the  better,  and  some 
returns  obtained  for  the    timber.    In    many   cases    when    the    primeval    forest    is 


116  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

left  in  isolated  blocks,  trees  are  turned  up  by  the  roots;  various  kinds  of  insects 
attack  the  decaying  trees,  and  the  work  of  destruction  goes  on  rapidly.  Not  so 
with  the  second  growth,  which  adapts  itself  to  the  changed  conditions  of  sur- 
roundings.   Our  native  forests  are  to  be  considered  as  exhaustible. 

It  is  not  pleasant  to  consider  that  the  end  is  rapidly  approaching,  unless  we 
begin  to  give  more  attention  to  the  study  of  the  subject  and  see  to  it  that 
some  of  the  youngest  and  smallest  trees  are  spared  for  another  crop.  In  most 
cases,  very  likely,  those  who  cut  the  first  crop  will  leave  the  recuperation  to 
other  hands.  The  history  of  other  countries  has  repeatedly  shown  that  "  no 
system  of  agriculture  can  be  long  successful  and  profitable  which  ignores  the 
necessity  of  renewing  and  cultivating  trees;"  and,  we  might  add,  that  fails  to 
.give  attention   to  the  needs  of  the  trees  which  remain. 


THE    SALT    PRODUCT. 


The  manufacture  of  salt  was  inaugurated  in  Michigan  in  Saginaw  in  1860.  It 
required  a  large  expenditure  in  money  and  much  experience  before  the  indus- 
try had  passed  the  experimental  stage  and  reached  substantial  ffcoting  as  a 
foremost  industry.  Between  1860  and  1866  not  less  than  8200,000  were  invested  in 
the  great  salt  scheme  on  the  Saginaw,  and  men  w^ere  bankrupted.  It  is  safe  to 
say  that  prior  to  1870  not  a  dollar  was  made  in  manufacturing  salt  in  Michigan 
because  of  the  inexperience  of  the  men  engaged  in  the  work,  and  because  of  the 
greed  to  get  all  the  salt  there  was  in  the  brine.  The  brine  as  it  comes  from  the 
earth  on  the  Saginaw  contains  iron,  which  made  the  salt  rusty;  bromide  of  sodium 
that  made  it  bitter,  and  gypsum  that  made  it  cake,  and  all  of  which  made  it  prac- 
tically useless  except  as  a  fertilizer.  The  wiser  men  saw  that  it  was  a  losing  game 
unless  they  could  get  rid  of  these  impurities  and  compel  all  manufacturers  to  do 
so.  In  1869  a  law  was  enacted  by  the  legislature  making  it  compulsory  that  all 
salt  manufactured  in  the  State  should  be  inspected.  To  secure  this  enactment 
the  saltmakers  imposed  upon  themselves  a  special  tax  to  cover  the  expenses  of  the 
office.  That  worked  well  and  the  quality  of  Michigan  salt  rapidly  rose.  But  there 
were  obstacles  in  the  way  of  putting  it  on  the  market.  In  1876  an  association  was 
formed,  including  all  the  prominent  manufacturers,  whereby  all  were  bound  to 
observe  certain  rules  and  regulations  that  were  thought  to  be  conducive  to  the 
success  of  Michigan  salt.  The  association  handled  all  the  salt  produced  by  its 
members,  and  thus  secured  uniform  prices. 

Salt  works  in  the  Saginaw  valley  are  operated  in  connection  with  steam  saw 
mills,  and  the  refuse  from  the  manufacture  of  lumber  and  shingles  is  used  for  fuel 
in  evaporating  the  salt  brine.  By  this  method  the  production  of  salt  is  the  most 
economical  in  the  United  States. 

The  following  table  prepared  by  William  A.  Raborg  gives  the  amount  produced 
in  the  various  states  and  territories  in  1890. 

The  production  of  salt  in  the  United  States  during  the  years  1889  and  1890  vas 
as  follows:  In  1889,  8,005,565  barrels,  valued  at  $4,195,412,  and  in  1890,  8,776,991 
barrels,  valued  at  $4,752,286.  The  amount  and  value  of  the  salt  produced  in  the 
various  states  and  territories  in  the  latter  year,  1890,  is  given  in  the  following  table:

With  a  production  of  3,837,632  barrels  of  salt,  valued  at  $2,302,579,  Michigan 
headed  the  list  of  salt  producing  states  and  territories  in  1890.  In  1889  the  pro- 
duction was  3,856,929  barrels,  valued  at  $2,088,909.  Since  1887  there  has  been  a 
yearly  decrease  in  the  production,  although  the  amount  of  salt  made  continued  to 
represent  over  one-half  the  product  of  the  United  States. 

The  average  depths  of  the  wells  in  the  different  counties  were  as  follows:  Mason, 
2,200  feet;  Manistee,  2.000  feet;  St.  Clair,  1,700  feet;  Huron,  1,200  feet;  Midland,  1,200 
feet;  Bay,  Saginaw,  and  Iosco,  850  feet. 

During  1890  there  were  one  hundred  and  twenty-two  salt  producing  companies 
in  the  State,  ninety-seven  of  which  were  in  operation,  having  a  capacity  of  production 
of  5,950,000  barrels.

THE    SALT    MAEKET. 


The  manufacture  of  salt  of  late  has  not  been  very  profitable,  and  but  for  the  fact 
that  it  has  been  produced  in  connection  with  the  manufacture  of  lumber  products, 
the  refuse  from  the  logs  furnishing  the  fuel  for  evaporating  the  brine,  the  produc- 
tion of  salt  in  this  State  would  have  been  comparatively  on  a  limited  scale.  The 
impression  has  gained  a  foothold  throughout  the  country  that  the  salt  indus- 
try is  a  monopoly,  and  that  every  person  who  engaged  therein  was  inevitably  ta 
become  a  millionaire.  That  such  is  not  the  fact  is  shown  by  the  following  com- 
parison of  net  prices  obtained  by  the  manufacturers,  based  on  a  barrel  of  280 
pounds,  with  a  20-cent  package  included:

COAL 


BY   S.    G.    HIGGINS,    SAGINAW. 


Coal  is  found  in  this  State  over  a  pretty  wide  area,  in  Huron,  Arenac,  Shiawas- 
see, Clinton,  Ingham,  Eaton,  Jackson,  and  in  other  counties;  but  it  has  only  been 
extensively  mined  in  Shiawassee  and  Jackson  counties,  principally  in  the  latter. 
Coal  mining  has  for  many  years  been  a  prominent  industry  in  and  about  Jackson. 
(Extract  Report  Mineral   Statistics.) 

[Extract  from  Review  of  Saginaw  Board  of  Trade.] 

It  has  been  known  for  many  years  that  coal  beds  existed  in  the  Saginaw  valley, 
but  no  practical  efforts  were  made  to  develop  them  until  about  three  years  ago, 
when  two  mines  were  opened  at  Sebewaing,  forty  miles  northeast  of  Saginaw,  on 
the  line  of  the  Saginaw,  Tuscola  &amp;  Huron  railroad,  one  by  the  Saginaw  Bay  Coal 
Company,  controlled  by  Saginaw  capitalists,  and  the  other  by  the  Sebewaing  Coal 
Company,  controlled  by  Bay  City  and  Tuscola  county  capitalists.  The  coal  has 
found  a  ready  market,  the  demand  being  greater  than  the  companies  were  able  to 
supply,  owing  to  the  scarcity  of  labor  to  work  the  mines.  During  1892  there  were 
shipped  from  Sebewaing.  eight  hundred  and  six  cars  of  coal,  being  an  average  of 
sixty-seven  cars  per  month,  which  went  to  various  points  in  the  State.  The 
demand  for  the  coal  is  rapidly  increasing,  and  during  the  present  winter  the  com- 
panies were   compelled   to  decline   many  orders. 

The  coal  is  found  at  Sebewaing  about  one  hundred  feet  from  the  surface,  in  a 
bed  averaging  four  and  one-half  feet  in  thickness.  It  is  an  excellent  quality  of 
bituminous  coal.  Owing  to  its  cokeing  qualities,  it  has  a  tendency  to  run  together 
and  form  a  mass  on  the  grates,  unless  properly  handled.  At  first  this  was  a 
serious  drawback  to  the  use  of  the  coal,  but  now  that  it  is  better  understood,  the 
firemen  have  no  difficulty  in  using  it.  The  coal  possesses  more  heat  units  than 
the  Ohio  coal,  acd  is  a  cheaper  fuel  for  the  Saginaw  valley.

The  following  diagram  of  stratification  was  furnished  by  Saginaw  board  of  trade: 

This  salt  well,  as  will  be  seen  by 
the  diagram,  passed  through  two 
coal  bearing  strata,  one  23  feet  in 
thickness,  at  a  depth  of  211  feet,  and 
the  other  10  feet,  at  a  depth  of  246 
feet.  This  salt  well  was  located  in 
the  city  of  East  Saginaw,  now  a  part 
of  the  city  of  Saginaw.  The  accom- 
panying diagram  is  reproduced  from 
the  record  made  of  the  well  at  the 
time  it  was  put  down.  It  is  some- 
what remarkable  that  this  coal  has 
not  yet  been  opened  up,  and  is  an 
illustration  of  the  fact  that  we  have 
not  yet  begun  to  comprehend  the 
great  natural  wealth  and  resources 
of  the  Saginaw  valley. 

In  1875  coal  was  discovered  five 
miles  west  of  Saginaw,  on  section 
12,  town  12  north,  range  3  east.  A 
report  of  the  discovery,  printed  at 
the   time,   states   as  follows: 

"  Two  holes,  one-fourth  mile  apart, 
were  sunk  to  the  depth  of  one  hun- 
dred and  sixty-four  feet,  resulting 
in  finding  a  superior  article  of  bitu- 
minou  scoal.  During  the  past  sum- 
mer another  hole  was  bored  nearly 
a  fourth  mile  distant  from  the 
others,  and  the  following  is  the  log 
of  the  borers:

"The  following  analysis  was  re- 
ported by  the  chemist  to  whom  the 
coal  borings  were  submitted: 


Coal.  123 

Per  cent. 

Carbon 73.3 

Ash 5.7 

Sulphur .68 

"  The  almost  entire  absence  of  sulphur  and  the  large  preponderance  of  carbon 
render  this,  it  is  claimed  by  those  who  claim  to  be  posted,  fully  equal  to  the 
product  of  the   celebrated  Blossburg   and  Cumberland   mines." 

The  report  goes  on  to  say  that  drillings  at  a  point  southwest  from  the  holes 
above  mentioned,  on  the  banks  of  the  Tittabawassee  river,  struck  a  bed  of  coal 
•seven  feet   thick,  one  hundred   and   fifty-eight   feet   from  the   surface. 

During  the  past  year  coal  has  been  discovered  at  numerous  places  in  Saginaw 
county,  south  and  southwest  from  Saginaw,  from  forty  to  fifty  feet  below  the 
surface,  with  good  roof,  and  in  beds  of  five  to  seven  feet  in  thickness,  and  of  a 
most  excellent  quality. 

There  is  no  reason  to  doubt  but  the  whole  Saginaw  valley  is  underlaid  with 
rich  deposits  of  coal,  which  will  furnish  an  unlimited  supply  of  fuel  for  the  great 
'manufacturing  industries  to  be   developed, 

It  is  said  by  experts  who  have  examined  the  coal,  that  it  is  what  is  called  a 
"caking"  or  coking  coal,  and  suitable  for  use  in  smelting  iron  ore.  This  is  the 
nearest  coal  "to  the  rich  bessemer  ores  of  the  upper  peninsula,  and  these  ores 
•could  be  hauled  in  cars  direct  from  the  mines  to  Saginaw  for  smelting,  saving  the 
long  journey  to  Cleveland  and  Pittsburgh,  and  the  numerous  transfers  from  cars 
to  boats  and  from  boats  to  cars.  Furthermore,  the  cars  could  run  winter  and 
•summer,  and  save  the  expense  of  piling  the  ore  on  the  surface  at  the  mines  dur- 
ing the  winter  while  navigation  is  closed.  It  requires  two  tons  of  coke  to  smelt 
one  ton  of  ore,  and  hence  the  ore  must  come  to  the  coke  for  smelting.  The  great 
deposits  of  iron  ore  in  the  Duluth  region  cannot  be  utilized  there,  for  want  of  fuel, 
but  with  a  good  coke  at  Saginaw   we   could   smelt   a   large   part   of  these  ores. 

This  is  an  essential  element  of  independence  in  the  State.  While  the  State  is 
not  far  from  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania  and  transportation  is  not  exhorbitant,  without 
a  home  supply  we  would  be  subject  to  accidents  and  at  the  mercy  of  combines. 
If  the  coal  supply  develops,  as  anticipated  by  the  more  sanguine  and  enterprising, 
Michigan  takes  one   step   upward. 


RAILROAD    DEPARTMENT  —  THE    COMMISSIONER    OF 

RAILROADS.

The  Commissioner  of  Railroads  is  appointed  under  the  provisions  of  act  No.  79, 
session  laws  of  1873.  He  holds  his  office  for  the  term  of  two  years  upon  appoint- 
ment of  the  Governor  by  and  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate,  and  until 
his  succeesor  is  appointed  and  qualified. 

It  is  the  duty  of  the  Commissioner  of  Railroads  generally  to  examine  into  the 
condition  and  management  of  the  business  of  the  railroads  in  the  State,  so  far  as 
the  same  affects  or  relates  to  the  interests  of  the  public,  and  to  ascertain  whether 
such  railroad  companies  and  their  officers  and  employes  comply  with  the  laws  of 
the  State  in  force  concerning  them. 

It  is  also  his  duty  to  require  annual  reports  from  all  railroad  companies  doing 
business  in  the  State  on  the  first  day  of  April  of  each  year,  showing  their  condition 
and  traffic  operations  for  the  year  ending  on  the  31st  of  December  preceding. 

At  least  once  each  year  to  visit  every  county  in  the  State  having  a  railroad 
station  within  its  limits,  and  to  inspect  and  examine  the  tracks,  bridges,  buildings, 
and  other  structures,  so  as  to  know  that  they  are  in  safe  and  effective  condition, 
and  managed  in  accordance  with  the  police  regulations  of  the  State. 

To  order  safety  gates  or  riagmen  at  highway  and  street  crossings;  to  prescribe  a 
uniform  code  of  signals  at  all  crossings  and  junctions  of  railroads  within  the  State; 
to  inspect  and  determine  upon  the  sufficiency  of  all  fences  and  to  prescribe  the 
manner  of  constructing  the  same;  to  require  and  receive  reports  of  all  accidents 
resulting  in  a  loss  of  life  or  otherwise,  and  to  investigate  the  causes  of  the  same; 
to  direct  the  erection  of  safety  guards  at  overhead  obstructions;  to  provide  a  uniform 
system  of  accounts  for  all  the  railroad  corporations  of  the  State;  to  i-egulate  the 
speed  of  trains  upon  defective  tracks  and  to  stop  them  entirely  if  in  his  judgment 
the  public  safety  requires.  To  direct  prosecutions  for  infractions  of  the  railroad 
laws;  to  compute  and  report  to  the  Auditor  General  on  the  first  of  July  of  each 
year  the  taxes  due  and  payable  from  each  railroad  company,  and  from  all  palace 
car  companies,  fast  freight  lines,  etc.,  doing  business  in  the  State,  upon  their  gross

receipts  for  the  preceding  year;  to  make  an  annual  report  to  the  Governor,  on  or 
before  the  first  day  of  January  of  each  year,  of  his  doings  for  the  preceding  year, 
or  for  the  time  intervening  since  his  last  report,  containing  such  facts,  statements 
and  explanations  as  will  disclose  the  actual  workings  of  the  system  of  railroad 
transportation  of  freight  and  passengers,  and  its  bearings  upon  the  business  pros- 
perity, personal  convenience  and  safety  of  the  people  of  the  State,  with  such  sug- 
gestions in  relation  thereto  as  to  him  may  seem  appropriate. 

He  is  empowered  to  appoint  a  deputy,  with  the  approval  of  the  Governor,  whose 
powers  are  defined  by  law,  and  in  case  of  the  death,  resignation  or  removal  of  the 
commissioner,  the  deputy  performs  the  duties  of  the  commissioner  until  a  suc- 
cessor shall  be  appointed.  (See  3285  to  3312  a  inclusive,  Howell's  annotated  stat- 
utes.)   He  shall  also  appoint  a  mechanical  engineer.    (See  act  247,  laws  of  1887.) 

It  will  be  seen  from  the  above  that  the  office  of  Commissioner  of  Railroads  is  a 
very  important  and  responsible  position.  It  is  ably  filled  by  the  present  incum 
bent,  Hon.  S.  R.  Billings,  of  Davison,  Mich. 

The  duties  and  work  of  the  department  of  the  Commissioner  of  Railroads  will  be 
more  readily  understood  when  it  is  remembered  there  are  79  railroad  companies 
operating  in  this  State  with  a  mileage  of  7,502  of  main  line  track,  exclusive  of  spurs 
and  side  tracks,  and  1,489  railway  stations  required  to  be  inspected  every  year. 
There  are  also  773  wood  and  iron  bridges,  30  draw  bridges,  2,302  combination  and 
trestles,  340  railroad  crossings  at  grade,  40  railroad  crossings  over  or  under,  7,282 
highway  crossings,  495  highway  crossings  with  gates  or  signals,  318  highway  cross- 
ings over  or  under,  9,712  miles  of  fencing,  75  interlocking  and  derailing  switch  and 
signal  systems.     These  all  require  the  constant  attention  of  the  Commissioner. 

The  railroads  operating  in  and  partly  within  and  partly  without  Michigan  are  a 
very  important  factor  in  connection  w^ith  the  business  commerce  of  the  State. 
They  employ  26,838  persons  in  the  State,  carry  about  34,208,271  passengers  and 
move  57,852,628  tons  of  freight  per  year.  The  total  income  from  all  sources 
amounts  to  $96,682,121.41,  and  the  total  amount  paid  out  for  operating  expenses, 
interest  and  rentals  amounts  to  $87,141,330.11.  The  amount  of  authorized  capital 
stock  and  debt  is  $767,668,559.30.  The  total  cost  of  the  railroads  and  equip- 
ments for  Michigan  to  December  31,  1892,  is  $294,611,753,84;  3.222  locomotives, 
1,650  passenger  cars  and  108,246  cars  of  all  other  kinds  are  used  in  conducting  this 
vast  amount  of  business,  which  is  steadily  increasing.  It  required  65,547  tons 
of  new  rails  and  2,370,130  new  ties  to  keep  the  railroads  in  Michigan  in  repair 
for  the  year  ending  1891. 

The  amount  of  taxes  for  the  year  ending  December  31,  1892,  due  the  State 
from  the  railroads  and  payable  July  1,  1893,  is  $893,762.01,  an  increase  of  $39,- 
427.89  over  the  year  1891.  The  taxes  paid  the  State  by  railroads  is  steadily 
increasing,  and  for  the  past  five  years  shows  an  average  increase  of  $36,328.69. 
If  this  increase  is  maintained,  the  amount  will  soon  reach  $1,000,000. 

A  little  study  of  the  above  will  show  the  necessity  and  importance  of  the 
duties    of   the  Commissioner   of  Railroads   and   his   department. 

Railroads  are  in  close  touch  with  the  pulse  of  the  nation.  They  throb  and 
beat  with  every  fluctuation  of  business.  The  volume  of  business  done  by  the 
railroads  indicate  the  prosperity  of  the   State  and    country. 

Several  important  bills  were  passed  by  the  legislature  of  1893  affecting  the 
railroads  operating  in   this    State.      The  two  most   important   are   as   follows:      A 


126  Michigan  and  its  Resoukces. 

bill  to  provide  separate  grades  for  railroads  and  public  highways  and  streets 
where  railroads  intersect  such  highways  and  streets;  also  a  bill  to  regulate  the 
construction  of  the  tracks  of  railroads  and  street  railroads  across  each  other, 
and  stringing  of  wires,  electric  or  other,  above  railroad  tracks,  and  relative  to 
the  maintenance  of  such  tracks  heretofore  so  constructed  and  wires  heretofore- 
so  strung. 

Great  credit  is  due  to  the  officers  managing  the  railroads  in  this  State  for 
the  constant  care  and  efficient  manner  in  which  they  are  operated,  and  it  is  only 
,fair  to  state  that  the  management  and  officers  of  the  railroads  doing  business 
in  Michigan  are  ever  desirous  and  willing  to  obey  and  comply  with  the  laws. 
They  cheerfully  cooperate  with  the  Commissioner  of  Railroads  in  carrying  out 
recommendations  or  instructions  given  by  said  commissioner  tending  to  promote 
the  safety  or  the  protection  of  life  and  property. 

The  figures  given  in  this  article  are  chiefly  taken  and  compiled  from  the- 
annual   reports  ending  December   31,  1891. 

At  this  date  nearly  every  county  in  the  State  is  traversed  by  railroads.  A 
glance  at  the  map  in  the  front  of  this  book  will  show  how  well  the  State  is 
supplied  with  this  convenience,  and  the  competition  is  so  great  the  fare  for  pass- 
enger and  freight  is  reasonable  if  not  low.  It  is  deemed  unnecessary  to  make' 
special   mention  of  each  road. 

TEANSPORTATION, 

Besides  a  network  of  railroads  no  country  in  the  world  of  equal  magnitude  will 
show  equal  facilities  for  water  transportation.  All  cities  on  the  coast  of  the  great 
lakes  surrounding  Michigan  have  communication  with  the  world.  Vessels  carrj^- 
ing  1,000,000  feet  of  newly  cut  lumber  clear  from  ports  on  Lake  Michigan.  A 
moment's  reflection  will  surprise  you.  A  freight  car  will  carry  10,000  feet  of  lumber. 
It  would  require  one  hundred  cars  full  loaded  to  carry  one  vessel  load;  five  full 
trains  of  twenty  cars  each,  with  the  necessary  expense  of  five  conductors,  five 
engineers,  five  firemen,  and  a  number  of  brakesmen,  taking  this  with  stationmen,. 
roadmen,  trackmen,  all  to  be  paid  from  the  profits,  makes  it  necessary  as  a  busi- 
ness to  charge  higher  freight  rates  than  vessels.  Saginaw  is  miles  inland  and 
yet  is  connected  by  river  navigable  by  large  vessels.  Grand  Rapids  will  in  the 
course  of  time  be  linked  to  Lake  Michigan  by  a  deepening  of  Grand  river.  New 
York  has  a  few  cities  which  are  favored  by  water  transportation.  Ohio  has  Cleve- 
land, Cincinnati  and  Toledo.  Illinois  has  Chicago  and  cities  on  the  Mississippi. 
Wisconsin  has  Milwaukee  and  other  cities  of  less  importance,  and  many  other 
states  a  mere  taste  of  water  transportation.  Michigan  has  Ontonagon,  Marquette, 
the  "Soo,"  Escanaba,  Menominee,  Muskegon,  Grand  Haven,  Alpena,  Port  Huron, 
Saginaw,  Bay  City.  St.  Clair,  Detroit,  and  others  of  smaller  importance.  More  than 
any  other  country  in  the  world,  and  in  order  to  compete  with  this  the  railroads 
must  offer  great  inducements  in  the  way  of  cheap  rates  and  accommodations. 

THE   ST.   CLAIR   TUNNEL. 

The  United  States  and  the  Dominion  of  Canada  are  divided  by  the  St.  Clair 
river,  which  great  stream  is  the  connecting  link  of  the  greatest  group  of  lakes  in 
the  world.    Through  this  river  the  waters  of  Lakes  Michigan,  Superior  and  Huron

flow   onward   toward  the  great   tumble   at  Niagara,   eventually  to  reach  the  briny 
Atlantic   through  the  wild,   majestic   St.  Lawrence. 

It  is  by  nature  as  well  as  by  adoption  the  great  artery  or  canal  of  inland  com- 
merce, national  and  international  in  importance,  hence  to  obstruct  would  be  a 
national  and  international  interruption.  Across  this  great  highway  of  navigation, 
the  interchanging  inland  commerce  between  east  and  west,  a  way  must  be  pro- 
vided. A  bridge  was  impractiable,  ferries  difficult  and  uncertain  on  account  of 
ice  and  interruption.  The  problem  was  solved  by  the  Grand  Trunk  system  by 
the  construction  of,  in  many  respects,  the  greatest  tunnel  of  modern  history,  virt- 
ually leaving  the  grand  St.  Clair  river  clear  to  navigation  uninterrupted  by  ferries. 
While  it  is  intended  to  do  no  advertising  in  this  work  it  would  be  impossible 
to  make  mention  properly  of  the  great  St,  Clair  tunnel  without  mentioning  the 
Grand  Trunk  railroad,   the   designer  and  finisher   of   the   work. 

A  few  statistics,  only  a  few  of  special  interest,  may  be  given  here.  The 
length  of  the  tunnel  proper  is  6,025  feet,  and  of  the  open  portals  or  approaches 
5,603  feet  additional,  or  more  than  two  miles  in  all,  the  longest  sub-marine  tunnel 
in  the  world.  It  is  a  continuous  iron  tube,  nineteen  feet  ten  inches  in  diameter, 
put  together  in  sections  as  the  work  of  boring  proceeded,  and  firmly  bolted 
together,   the  total   weight   of   the   iron   aggregating  56,000,000  pounds. 

The  work  was  commenced  in  September,  1888,  and  it  was  opened  for  freight 
traffic  in  October,  1891,  a  little  more  than  three  years  being  required  for  its  com- 
pletion. Passenger  trains  began  running  through  it  December  7,  1891.  The  work 
was  begun  on  both  sides  and  carried  on  until  the  two  sections  met  in  mid-river, 
and  with  such  accuracy  that  they  were  perfectly  in  line  as  they  came  together. 
Throughout  its  entire  length  it  perforates  a  bed  of  blue  clay,  and  with  the  excep- 
tion of  an  occasional  pocket  of  quicksand  and  water,  with  once  in  a  while  a  rock 
or  bolder,  the  clay  was  the  only  material  met.  The  borings  were  made  by  means 
of  cylindrical  steel  shields  with  cutting  edges,  driven  forward  by  hydraulic  rams 
and  as  fast  as  the  clay  was  cut  away  a  section  of  the  iron  wall  of  the  tunnel 
was  bolted  to  its  fellow  section,  and  thus  the  wall  was  completed  as  the  work 
progressed.  The  rails  of  the  track  rest  upon  cross  ties  only  six  inches  apart, 
laid  on  stringers  which  in  turn  rest  on  a  bed  of  brick  and  concrete,  filling  the 
bottom   of   the   tube. 

The  engines  used  for  pulling  the  trains  through  the  tunnel  and  up  the  steep 
grade  after  emerging,  are  the  largest  in  the  world,  having  ten  drive  wheels,  and 
weighing  nearly  200,000  pounds.  The  boilers  are  74  inches  in  diameter,  the  fire- 
boxes 132  and  one-half  inches  long  and  42  and  one-eighth  inches  wide,  and  the 
cylinders   are  22  inches   in   diameter,   with  28-inch  stroke. 

The  cost  of  the  great  tunnel  was  $2,700,000.  and  when  it  is  understood  that 
4,000  cars  can  be  daily  moved  through  it  and  this  is  contrasted  with  the  slow, 
laborious  and  dangerous  transfers  by  ferries,  it  will  readily  appear  that  the  enor- 
mous  expenditure  was  a   wise  undertaking   and   will   yield  profitable   returns. 

We  cannot  give  the  G.  T.  R.  R.  Co.  too  much  credit  for  the  undertaking, 
when  the  expenditure  and  risk  is  considered.  At  its  own  expense  it  demonstrated 
the  fact  that  capital  and  engineering  skill  will  accomplish  most  anything.  No 
one  can  pass  through  this  tunnel  without  being  impressed  with  the  permanent 
character  of  its  construction  and  the  safety,  speed,  and  certainty  of  travel  and 
transportation.    It   will   remain   a  lasting  monument  to  its  projectors. 


the' SHIPPING   PORTS. 


BY    RICHARD   A.    PARKER,    C.    E.,    OF    MARQUETTE. 


The  Lake  Superior  region  furnished  nearly  fifty-five  per  cent  of  the  ore  mined 
in  the  United  States  in  1892,  and  of  that  quantity  Michigan  furnished  eighty- 
six  per  cent.  In  no  other  part  of  the  world  are  there  equal  facilities  for  the 
handling  and  transportation  of  such  vast  quantities  of  ore.  A  practically  all  water 
route  from  the  mines  to  the  furnaces  makes  possible  the  transportation  of  ores  in 
great  bulks.  In  fact,  but  for  this  provision  of  nature,  the  district  would  be  almost 
worthless  on  account  of  the  prohibitory   cost  of  transportation   in   carload  lots. 

The  great  extent  of  coast  line  and  its  deep  indentations  afford  a  number  of 
fine  harbors,  some  of  which  have  been  equipped  expressly  for  the  handling  of 
iron  ore.  A  brief  sketch  of  these  harbors  will  be  of  interest.  The  first  Lake 
Superior  iron  ore  was  shipped  from  Marquette  early  in  the  fifties,  and  up  to 
the  close  of  1892  a  total  of  18,644,203  tons  had  passed  from  its  docks  into  the 
holds  of  vessels.  The  amount  shipped  in  1892  was  1,027,323  tons.  Until  1879 
Marquette  held  the  lead  in  quantity  of  ore  handled,  but  in  that  year  Escanaba 
gained  it.  Three  docks,  one  recently  built  and  another  greatly  extended,  together 
with  their  incidental  rolling  stock,  constitute  the  equipment  for  transferring  the 
ore  from  the  cars  into  the  holds  of  lake  carriers.  No.  4  dock,  built  in  1889-90, 
is  a  specimen  of  the  most  modern  and  perfect  structure  of  its  class  and  cost 
$250,000.  It  was  fully  described  and  illustrated,  with  the  designer's  drawings, 
in   the   New    York  Engineering  and  Mining  Journal   of  January   10  and   17.   1891. 

Herewith  is  a  brief  sketch  of  the  three  docks  all  owned  by  the  Duluth,  South 
Shore  and  Atlantic  Railway  Company. 

No.  1.— Height  of  dock  above  water  forty-two  feet  for  first  thirteen  hundred  feet 
of  its  length;  the  new  extension  of  six  hundred  feet  is  forty-four  feet  above  water; 
number  of  pockets  two  hundred  and  seventy,  number  of  tracks  three,  capacity 
twenty-seven  thousand  long  tons. 

No.  2.— This  was  a  small  and  antiquated  structure.  In  1892  it  was  dismantled 
and   a  merchandise  pier  was  erected  on  the  piles. 

No.  3.— Height  of  dock  above  water  forty-four  feet,  length  sixteen  hundred  feet, 
number  of  pockets  three  hundred,  number  of  tracks  three,  capacity  twenty-five 
thousand  long  tons. 


The  Shipping   Pobts.  129 


No.  i. — Height  above  water,  forty-seven  and  one-half  feet;  length,  fourteen  hun- 
dred feet;   capacity   thirty   thousand   long   tons. 

L'Anse  became  an  ore  shipping  port  in  1873  by  the  building  of  a  dock  owned 
by  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  and  Atlantic  Railroad  Company  for  the  handling  of 
the  product  from  the  west  end  of  the  Marquette  range.  The  dock  is  thirty-eight 
feet  high,  one  thousand  feet  long,  contains  a  hundred  pockets,  and  has  a  capac- 
ity of  eight  thousand  long  tons.  No  ore  has  been  shipped  thence  since  1885.  The 
total  reached  seven  hundred  and  forty-four  thousand  six  hundred  and  ninety-seven 
tons, 

St.  Ignace  has  been  a  shipping  port  on  a  small  scale  since  1882,  and  has  handled 
six  hundred  and  ten  thousand  two  hundred  and  fifteen  tons  of  ore.  In  1891  the 
dock  was  shortened  four  hundred  feet,  the  material  being  removed  to  Marquette 
for  the  extension  of  No.  1  dock  there.  As  constructed  it  was  eight  hundred  feet 
long,  forty-two  feet  high,  contained  one  hundred  pockets  and  three  tracks,  and 
had  a  capacity  of  ten  thousand  long  tons. 

Escanaba  has  maintained  the  lead  she  won  in  1879  and  her  aggregate  tonnage 
of  iron  ore  in  1891  and  1892  led  the  world.  Shipment  began  in  1865  by  putting 
the  Marquette  range  under  tribute.  In  1877  the  new  Menominee  range  began  to 
empty  her  treasures  into  the  lap  of  the  coming  iron  port  of  the  world.  In  1892 
her  shipments  were  4,012,197  tons,  nearly  one-half  the  entire  ore  shipment  of  the 
whole  Lake  Superior  region.  The  stupendous  quantity  of  33,975,454  tons  of  iron 
ore  has  passed  through  her  gates  en  route  to  lower  lake  receiving  ports. 

The  Chicago  and  Northwestern  Railway  company  is  the  owner  of  the  five 
immense  docks  at  Escanaba.  These  docks,  together  with  their  equipment  of  cars, 
cost  $2,290,000.    They   are  described  as  follows: 

No.  1.— Height,  forty-six  feet;  length  eleven  hundred  and  four  feet;  pockets,  one 
hundred  and  eighty-four;  tracks,  two;  capacity  twenty-three  thousand  long  tons. 

No.  2.— Height,  thirty-nine  feet;  length,  ten  hundred  and  eighty-two  feet;  pockets, 
one  hundred  and  ninety-two;  tracks,  two;  capacity,  nineteen  thousand  three  hun- 
dred long  tons. 

No.  3. — Height,  thirty-nine  feet;  length,  twelve  hundred  and  twelve  feet;  pockets, 
two  hundred  and  two;  tracks,  two;  capacity,  twenty  thousand  long  tons. 

No.  4.— Height,  forty-six  feet:  length,  fifteen  hundred  feet;  pockets,  two  hundred 
and  fifty;   tracks,  two;  capacity,  thirty-three  thousand  two  hundred   long  tons.' 

No.  5. — Height,  fifty-one  feet  ten  inches;  length,  thirteen  hundred  and  ninety-two 
feet;  pockets,  two  hundred  and  thirty-two;  tracks,  two;  capacity,  forty  thousand 
six  hundred   long   tons. 

At  Ashland  the  Wisconsin  Central  railway  has  one  dock  forty-six  feet  high,  fourteen 
hundred  and  four  feet  long,  contains  two  hundred  and  thirty-four  pockets  and 
three  tracks,  and  has  a  capacity  of  twenty-eight  thousand  two  hundred  and  fifty 
long  tons.  With  its  equipments  the  total  cost  was  §644,800.  The  Milwaukee,  Lake 
Shore  &amp;  Western  has  two  docks  there,  one  forty  and  the  other  forty-five  feet  high. 
Each  is  fourteen  hundred  and  four  feet  long  and  contains  two  hundred  and  thirty- 
four  pockets.  One  has  four  and  the  other  three  tracks.  Their  capacity  respectively 
is  twenty-three  thousand  and  twenty-seven  thousand  long  tons.  The  total  cost  with 
equipments   was  $813,000. 

Gladstone,  Michigan,  shares  with  Escanaba  the  care  of  the  Menominee  range

port.  Shipments  began  in  1889  and  attained  an  aggregate  of  458,711  tons  at  the 
end  of  1892.  The  Minneapolis,  Sault  Ste.  Marie  and  Atlantic  (Soo  Line)  is  the  owner 
of  the  dockage  facilities,  which  consist  of  one  dock  forty-seven  feet  high,  about 
twelve  hundred  feet  in  length,  contains  one  hundred  and  twenty  pockets  and  five 
tracks  and  has  a  capacity  of  sixteen  thousand  long  tons.  The  docks  are  all  wooden 
structures.  The  upper  deck  or  floor  is  from  forty  to  fifty  feet  above  water  level, 
sufficient  to  accommodate  bins  of  fifteen  to  twenty  feet  depth  with  outward  sloping 
bottoms  below  the  floor  level,  and  yet  high  enough  to  be  well  above  the  rail  of  the 
largest  vessels  lying  alongside.  Plate  iron  chutes  or  spouts  are  hinged  beneath 
small  doors  at  the  bottom  of  the  pockets.  The  doors  are  controlled  from  the  top 
of  the  docks  and  when  opened  they  discharge  the  ore  through  the  chutes  into  the 
hold  of  the  vessel.  In  this  manner  a  cargo  of  three  thousand  tons  is  often  loaded 
in  three  hours.  As  many  pockets  can  be  simultaneously  discharged  as  there  are 
hatchways  in  the  vessels.  As  the  principal  mining  companies  are  the  owners  of 
the  fleets  of  modern  and  capacious  lake  carriers  employed  exclusively  in  the  ore 
transportation  business,  the  product  of  the  mines  receives  most  expeditious  con- 
veyance to  the  furnaces. 

BILBOA   AND   LAKE   SUPERIOR   COMPARED. 

The  Bilboa  district  in  Spain  is  the  only  iron  producer  in  the  world  which 
will  stand  comparison  with  the  Lake  Superior  district  with  great  disparity  as  to 
quantity.  The  output  in  1860  of  the  Bilboa  district  is  not  known.  For  the  same 
period  the  production  of  the  Marquette  range,  the  only  producing  range  in  the 
Lake  Superior  district  to  1860,  and  for  many  years  after,  is  estimated  at  203,676 
long  tons.  The  figures  for  the  Bilboa  district  are  given  in  metric  tons,  but  as 
the  metric  ton  has  an  advantage  of  only  thirty-four  pounds  over  the  long  tons, 
the  quantity  making,  as  reported  by  the  chief  mining  engineer  of  the  province, 
may  be  compared  with  the  Lake  Superior  figures,  as  shown  in  the  following 
table  prepared  by  John  Birkinbine  for  embodiment  in  his  1891  report  on  mineral 
resources  to  the  census  bureau  of  the   United   States:

MICHIGAN'S    SYSTEM    OF    COMMON    SCHOOLS. 


BY   J.  E.  HAMMOND,  DEPUTY    SUPERINTENDENT   OF    PUBLIC   INSTRUCTION. 


The  State  of  Michigan  has  an  excellent  school  system.  No  State  in  propor- 
tion to  the  wealth  gives  a  more  generous  support  to  its  common  schools,  and 
the  denominational  colleges  and  normal  schools  take  high  rank  among  the  edu- 
cational  institutions  of   the   country. 

CLASSIFICATION    OF    THE    SCHOOLS. 

The  common  schools  are  known  as  graded  and  ungraded.  The  ungraded 
schools  exist  in  the  smaller  country  districts,  and  still  preserve  some  of  the 
chief  features  of  the  original   primary   school. 

Within  the  past  ten  years  a  large  number  of  the  ungraded  country  schools 
have  been  graded  by  the  teachers  and  school  officers,  under  the  supervision  of 
the  county  board  of  school  examiners,  and  now  have  prescribed  courses  of  study 
similar  to  those  of  the  villages  and  cities.  The  work  of  grading  all  the  coun- 
try schools  is  well  begun  and  in  the  near  future  it  may  seem  advisable  to 
make   another  classification   than   graded   and   ungraded. 

The  districts  are  well  distributed  throughout  the  State,  two  or  three  miles 
apart,  containing  from  three  to  nine  sections  of  land,  and  there  is  no  consid- 
erable village  or  city  within  the  boundary  of  Michigan  which  cannot  point  to 
its  substantial  school  buildings  as  one  of  its  most  attractive  features.  The 
statistics  gathered  by  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  for  1892  show 
that  every  organized  county  in  the  State  was  provided  with  school  houses  and 
that   with   very   few   exceptions    all   districts    maintained    school    during    the   year 


132 


Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 


The  number  of  school  houses  reported  for  1892  was  7,666,  of  which  5,897  were 
frame  buildings  and  only  390  were  log  structures.  The  whole  number  of  districts 
in  1892  was  7,145,  and  in  the  district  were  employed  16,100  teachers,  receiving  an 
aggregate  of  $2,639,301.54,  not  including  the  cost  of  buildings  and  the  salaries 
paid  in  seventeen  incorporated  institutions  within    the  limits  of  the  State. 

HIGHER   institutions   OF   LEARNING. 

The  institutions  above  referred  to  may  justly  be  considered  a  part  of  our  school 
systems,  as  into  them  annually  are  received  |thousands  of  the  best  students  of 
the  State.  These  institutions  supported  by  the  State  being  noticed  in  another 
part  of  this  work  we  speak  briefly  of  them  here.  Aside  from  the  school  for 
dependent  children,  for  the  deaf,  dumb  and  blind,  reformatory  for  boys,  and 
reformatory  for  girls,  Michigan  has  reason  to  be  proud  of  her  mining  school 
which  is  situated  in  the  richest  copper  bearing  region  of  the  country.  The  Agri- 
cultural College,  near  Lansing,  the  State  Normal  School  at  Ypsilanti,  and  above 
and  greater  than  all,  the  great  University,  at  Ann   Arbor. 

INCORPORATED   INSTITUTIONS. 

It  is  eminently  proper  in  this  connection  to  accord  a  little  time  and  space  to 
a  part  of  an  educational  system  that  may  not  be  included  elsewhere  and  which 
should  not  be  overlooked.

PRIVATE   AND   OTHER   SCHOOLS. 

There  are  in  Michigan  a  number  of  schools  under  private  control  of  some  merit. 
The  Catholic  church  maintains  parochial  schools  in  all  of  the  larger,  cities.  At 
Kalamazoo  is  located  a  female  seminary,  and  at  Orchard  Lake,  near  Pontiac,  is  a 
military  academy,  whose  course  includes  instructions  in  military  tactics.  There 
are  two  medical  colleges  located  in  Detroit,  and  a  number  of  private  institutions 
throughout  the  State  especially  devoted  to  commercial  training,  prominent  among 
■which  is  the  Ferris  Industrial  School  at  Big  Rapids,  Cleary's  Business  College  at 


Educational.  18H 


Ypsilanti,  and  Parson's  Business  College  at  Kalamazoo.  The  number  of  private 
schools  in  the  State  reported  to  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  in  1892 
was  two  hundred  and  eighty-eight,  giving  instruction  to  26,614  pupils. 

FUNDS   FOR   THE   SUPPORT    OF   EDUCATION. 

There  are  several  sources  of  revenue  for  the  support  of  the  primary   school. 

1.  Taxes  voted  by  school  districts.  The  voters  of  each  district  have  authority 
to  vote  amounts  for  the  support  of  schools  during  the  year,  under  certain  provi- 
sions of  law  imposed  with  the  view  of  preventing  extravagance.  The  taxes  thus 
voted  are  reported  by  school  officers  to  township  officers  and  by  them  spread 
upon  the  tax  roll  for  collection.  The  total  taxation  in  Michigan  in  1892  was 
§3,826,315.63,  or  about  one-third  of  a  cent  on  a  dollar  of  the  assessed  valuation  of 
the  State. 

2.  The  one  mill  tax.  Beside  the  so-called  district  tax  mentioned  above,  each 
township  raises  annually  a  tax  of  one-tenth  of  a  cent  on  each  dollar  of  its 
assessed  valuation,  and  this  is  apportioned  to  the  school  district  in  which  it  was 
raised,  provided  such  district  has  maintained  at  least  the  minimum  school  term 
required  by  law.  Such  part  of  this  tax  as  may  have  been  raised  in  unorganized 
territory,  or  in  districts  not  maintaining  the  required  school  term,  is  apportioned 
to  those  districts  which  have  complied  with  the  law,  according  to  the  number  of 
children  in  the  school  census.  In  1892  the  amount  realized  from  the  one  mill 
tax  was  §661,804.53. 

3.  The  Primary  School  Fund.  This  amount  is  paid  to  the  schools  twice  each 
year,  on  the  tenth  day  of  May  and  November.  The  Superintendent  of  Public 
Instruction  apportions  this  fund  to  the  various  counties  in  proportion  to  the 
number  of  children  of  school  age— 5  to  20— in  the  county.  The  amount  for  each 
county  is  apportioned  to  the  township  and  school  districts,  so  that  every  county, 
township  and  school  district  receives  now  from  the  State  in  1893  an  amount 
equal  to  three-fourths  of  the  entire  State  tax  paid.  Upon  the  organization  of 
Michigan  as  a  State,  the  moneys  derived  from  the  sale  of  section  16  was  made 
a  permanent  school  fund,  and  controlled  by  the  State  as  a  whole,  and  not  by 
each  individual  township,  as  in  some  states.  Another  source  of  revenue  to  this 
fund  is  the  money  received  from  the  sale  of  swamp  lands.  Formerly  only  one- 
half  received  from  the  sale  of  swamp  lands  went  into  the  school  fund  ;  now  the 
whole  amount  is  made  available  for  the  use  of  the  schools.  The  extinguishment 
of  the  State  debt  has  also  left  the  specific  tax  paid  by  the  corporations,  to  be 
added  to  the  income  of  the  primary  school  fund.  The  amount  per  capita  of  the 
primary  school  fund  twice  each  year  is  about  75  cents  per  pupil.  Total  amount 
received  in  this  way  in  1892  was  8906,810,  while  in  the  May  apportionment  alone 
in   1893  nearly  $520,000  was   distributed, 

4.  Aid  comes  to  the  schools  from  various  other  sources.  The  tuition  of  non- 
resident pupils  amounts  to  a  considerable  in  many  graded  village  schools,  and  by 
a  law  of  the  legislature  of  1881  all  the  money  received  from  the  dog  tax  in 
excess  of  §100  goes  into  the  fund  for  the  support  of  schools.  The  total  amount 
received  from  miscellaneous  sources  in  1892  was  §279,683. 

The   entire   sum   realized   for   school   purposes  in   1892  was  §5,738,222.69.

SCHOOL   YEAR   REQUIRED    BY    LAW. 

In  section  V  of  article  XIII  of  the  constitution  of  the  State  is  found  the  fol- 
lowing provision:  "A  school  shall  be  maintained  in  each  school  district  at  least 
three  months  in  each  year."  Also  in  section  XIV  of  chaper  IV  of  the  school 
laws  will  be  found  the  statutory  provision  concerning  the  number  of  months  to 
be  taught  in  a  school  year,  to  entitle  districts  to  their  share  of  the  school  funds. 
Districts  having  less  than  thirty  children  are  required  to  maintain  school  at  least 
three  months;  districts  having  thirty  and  less  than  eight  hundred  children,  five 
months,  and  nine  months  in  all  districts  having  more  than  eight  hundred  chil- 
dren. The  penalty  for  non-compliance  with  this  requirement  is  the  forfeiture  of 
the  primary  money  and  mill  tax.  Very  few  districts  in  Michigan  are  deprived 
of  money  for  these  reasons. 

SUPERVISION. 

The  head  of  Michigan's  school  system  is  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruc- 
tion, whose  duties  are  too  numerous  to  be  enumerated  here.  One  of  the  most 
important  of  the  duties  of  this  official  is  the  preparing  of  an  annual  report 
containing: 

A  statement  showing  the  condition  of  the  State  and  incorporated  institutions, 
also  the  primary,  graded  and  high  schools. 

Estimates  and  amounts  of  expenditure  of  all  educational   funds. 

Plans  for  the  management  of  all  educational  funds  and  the  better  organiza- 
tion of  the  educational  system. 

Abstracts  of  the  annual  report  of  the  school  inspectors  of  the  several  town- 
ships and  cities  of  the  State. 

teachers'  institutes. 

He  is  authorized  by  law  to  conduct  teachers'  institutes  in  various  parts  of  the 
State,  or  if  unable  to  attend  in  person,  to  appoint  a  suitable  person  or  persons 
to  conduct  the  same,  subject  to  certain  regulations  which  the  superintendent 
may  prescribe.  Such  institutes  are  held  annually  in  nearly  every  county,  and 
are  of  much  practical  value  to  those  who  avail  themselves  of  the  advantages 
thus  afforded.  During  the  year  1892  institutes  were  held  in  sixty-nine  counties 
of  the  State,  with  an  aggregate  aittendance  of  6,346  teachers.  All  male  teachers 
are  required  to  pay  an  annual  institute  fee  of  one  dollar,  and  all  female  teachers 
a  fee  of  fifty  cents.  This  amount  with  a  State  appropriation  not  to  exceed  $1,800, 
is  used  for  the  support  of  teachers'  institutes.  The  Superintendent  of  Public 
Instruction  is  elected  at  the  November  election  for  a  term  of  two  years  and 
receives  a  salary  of  $2,000  per    year. 

CITY   SCHOOLS. 

The  control  of  the  city  schools  is  in  the  hands  of  a  school  board,  consisting  of 
five  or  more  members,  elected  at  the  annual  school  meeting  for  terms  of  three 
years.  The  supervision  and  government  of  each  school  is  in  the  hands  of  a  super- 
intendent of  schools,  who  is  elected  by  the  school  board  annually  for  a  period 
of  one  year,  although  many   city  boards   make  contracts  with   the  superintendent 


Educational.  135 


for  two  or  three  years.  The  superintendent  of  schools  is  held  responsible  to  the 
school  board  for  the  care  and  management  of  all  the  schools  of  the  city  district 
and  makes  reports  to  the  school  board  and  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction. 
The  schools  in  most  cities  are  not  under  the  supervision  of  the 

COUNTY    COMMISSIONER   OF   SCHOOLS. 

This  officer  is  elected  by  the  people  of  each  county  at  the  spring  election  for  a 
term  of  two  years.  His  salary  is  fixed  by  the  board  of  supervisors  limited  by 
certain  provisions  of  law,  relative  to  the  number  of  schools  under  supervision. 
The  minimum  salary  in  counties  containing  fifty  schools  is  S500,  and  maximum 
salary  paid  in  any  county  is  Sl,500.  He  visits  all  the  schools  of  the  county, 
receives  reports  from  townships  and  district  school  officers  and  transmits  them  to 
the  county  clerk  and  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction;  he  also  makes  such 
reports  to  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  as  may  be  required  by  that 
official.  As  assistant  conductor  of  the  institute  he  is  expected  to  take  an  active 
part  in  the  work  of  the  institute  and  is  usually  appointed  on  a  committee  of 
local  management.  Perhaps  the  most  important  of  the  duties  of  the  commis- 
sioner is  the 

EXAMINATION   OF   TEACHERS. 

In  this  work  he  is  assisted  by  two  school  examiners,  who  are  appointed  by  the 
board  of  supervisors  for  terms  of  two  years.  This  board  of  examiners  conducts 
the  examinations  and  grants  certificates  to  successful  applicants.  Questions  for 
examination  are  all  prepared  by  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  and 
sent  to  the  commissioner  under  seal  with  instructions  that  seal  shall  not  be 
broken  until  the  morning  of  the  examination  in  the  presence  of  the  teachers. 
Applicants  for  all  grades  of  certificates  are  examined  on  the  last  Thursday  and 
Friday  of  March  and  the  first  Thursday  and  Friday  of  August  of  each  year, 
and  for  those  who  apply  for  third  grade  only,  special  examinations,  not  to  exceed 
four   in   any   year,    are   conducted  by   the   board  of   examiners. 

In  addition  to  the  common  branches  persons  desiring  second  grade  certificates 
are  required  to  pass  an  examination  in  algebra  and  natural  philosophy.  Those 
who  apply  for  a  certificate  of  the  first  grade  are  examined  in  geometry,  general 
history   and   botany,  also  all  of   the  branches   mentioned   above. 

The  work  of  candidates  for  the  first  grade  must  be  examined,  approved  and 
countersigned  by  the  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction,  to  be  valid  through- 
out the  State.  First  grade  certificates  are  valid  for  four  years,  second  grade  for 
three  years  and  third  grade  for  one  year,  unless  sooner  revoked  for  cause  by 
the  power  granted  them.  The  institute  fee  is  usually  collected  at  the  time  of 
examination.  For  their  services  the  two  examiners  each  receive  four  dollars 
per  day. 

THE   TOWNSHIP   BOARD 

is  composed  of  the  township  clerk  and  two  school  inspectors.  This  board  has  con- 
trol  of   the   township   library,   establishes    the   boundaries  of   school   districts,   may 


1^6  Michigan  and  its  Resoueces. 

make  alteration  in  the  boundaries  of  the  same,  make  a  report  to  the  county  com- 
missioner and  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  of  the  schools  of  the  town- 
ship, and   hear   and   settle   disputes  from   district   officers. 

THE   DISTKICT    OFFICERS 

are  three  in  number,  namely,  director,  moderator  and  assessor.  The  director  is 
secretary  and  the  chief  officer.  The  moderator  is  chairman  of  the  board,  also  of 
the  district  meetings.  He  countersigns  all  orders  drawn  by  the  director.  The 
assessor  is  the  treasurer  of  the  board  and  pays  out  the  funds  of  the  district  on 
order  of  the  other  officers.  To  this  board  is  entrusted  the  care  and  management 
of  the  schools,  such  as  keeping  district  property  in  repair,  employing  teachers, 
etc.,  subject   to   certain   limitations  which   cannot   be   enumerated   here. 

TEXT    BOOKS. 

Michigan  has  no  adopted  series  of  text  books.  This  question  is  left  mainly  to 
local  control  with  certain  instructions  of  law.  The  district  board  is  authorized 
by  law  to  specify  the  studies  to  be  pursued  in  the  schools  of  the  district  and 
said  board  is  required  to  make  a  record  of  the  adoption  of  text  books,  and  it 
is  unlawful  for  them  to  change  such  books  within  five  years,  except  by  the  con- 
sent of  a  majority  of  the  qualified  voters  at  a  regularly  called  meeting.  This  is 
a  wise  provision  and  prevents  the  too  frequent  change  of  text  books  by  district 
officers.  Books  to  indigent  children  may  be  furnished  by  the  district  board  to 
children  whose  parents  are  unable  to  buy  the  necessary  books  and  the  expense 
thereof  paid  the  same   as   any  other  district  expense. 

FREE  TEXT  BOOKS 

may  be  provided  by  a  district  board  to  all  the  children  of  the  district  if  so 
authorized  by  a  majority  of  the  qualified  voters. 

LIBRARIES 

are  found  in  many  Michigan  schools.  There  is  scarcely  a  school  in  the  State 
employing  more  than  one  teacher  that  does  not  possess  a  few  books  of  refer- 
ence, and  many  schools  possess  large  and  well  arranged  libraries.  In  1892, 520 
townships  and  1110  districts  reported  libraries,  while  the  whole  number  of  volumes 
reported  in  both  township  and  district  libraries  for  the  same  year  was  548,652. 
The  amount  paid  for  the  support  of  district  libraries  was  $76,575.33,  and  for 
township  libraries  $5,860.12.  A  tax  for  the  support  of  a  township  library  may  be 
voted  by  the  voters  at  the  annual  meeting  and  raised  in  the  same  manner  as 
any  other  township  tax,  but  more  than  four-fifths  of  the  whole  amount  are  penal 
fines,  obtained  according  to  the  provisions  of  Section  XII  of  Article  XIII,  of 
the  constitution  of    the  State. 

"  Section  12.  The  legislature  shall  also  provide  for  the  establishment  of  at 
least  one  library  in  each  township  and  city;  and  all  fines  assessed  and  collected 
in  the  several  counties  and  townships  for  any  breach  of  the  penal  laws  shall  b&amp; 
exclusively   applied  to  the  support  of  such  libraries,   unless  otherwise  ordered  by

the  township  board  of  any  township,  or  the  board  of  education  of  any  city: 
Provided,  That  in  no  case  shall  such  fines  be  used  for  other  than  library  or 
school   purposes." 

BEADING   CIRCLES. 

Another  great  factor  for  good  we  mention  the  reading  circle  which  has  been 
formed  in  many  schools  in  the  State,  and  in  the  hands  of  energetic  commis- 
sioners, superintendents  and  teachers  are  doing  much  to  keep  out  the  hurtful, 
trashy  reading  and  supply  in  its  place  books  of  travel,  history,  science  and 
choice  gems  of  literature  before  stories  of  train  robberies  and  murder  are 
thought  of. 

NOKMAL   SCHOOLS   AND    PROFESSIONAL    INSTRUCTION. 

No  sketch  of  the  primary  school  system  of  the  State  would  be  complete  with- 
out  at   least   a  mention   of  our  Normal   School,   at   Ypsilanti. 

This  institution  is  included  in  the  article  on  the  State  institutions,  but  a  few 
facts  even  if  repeated  will  be  of  interest.  Organized  in  1852  it  is  now  in  the  forty- 
second  year  of  its  usefulness.  In  1892  one  hundred  and  seventy-eight  students 
graduated  from  its  courses,  thirty-seven  instructors  were  employed  and  one  thou- 
sand three  hundred  and  eighteen  students  were  in  attendance  during  the  year. 
The  estimated  value  of  the  buildings  and  grounds  of  this  institution  is  nearly  a 
quarter  of  a  million  dollars,  and  over  twelve  thousand  books  are  found  in  the 
library.  For  the  support  of  the  school  the  legislature  appropriates  about  $50,000 
annually  and  the  income  from  productive  funds  is  about  $5,000  per  year.  In  all 
two  thousand  two  hundred  students  have  graduated  from  the  school,  besides 
many  others  who,  not  having  completed  the  course,  are  numbered  among  the  pro- 
gressive teachers  of  the  State.  Michigan  is  justly  proud  of  the  work  of  this 
great  institution,  and  its  influence  is  felt  in  almost  every  village  and  city  through 
the  entire  State. 

THE   UNIVERSITY   AND   COLLEGES 

of  the  State  recognize  the  value  of  professional  training  for  teachers  and  nearly 
all  have  normal  departments  under  the  charge  of  practical  and  scholarly  common 
school  men.  Recognizing  such  instruction  as  of  real  merit  the  legislature  in  the 
season  of  1893  passed  an  act  making  it  lawful  for  the  State  Board  of  Education  to 
grant  teachers'  certificates  to  the  graduates  of  certain  colleges  which  give  the 
required  amount  of  normal  instruction.  In  this  connection  it  should  be  stated  that 
graduates  from  the  State  Normal  School  are  legally  qualified  teachers,  as  are 
the  graduates  of  the  literary  department  of  the  University. 

The  demand  for  trained  teachers  is  such  that  ii.^  several  localities  normal  schools 
under  private  control  are  conducted  by  able,  experienced  educators  and  are  doing 
good  service  to  the  schools  of  the  State.  Among  the  foremost  of  such  schools  are 
mentioned  the  Business  and  Collegiate  Institute  at  Benton  Harbor,  Normal  at 
Fenton,  Industrial  School  at  Big  Rapids,  Normal  School  and  Business  College, 
at  Mt.  Pleasant.

THE   SUMMER   SCHOOLS 

at  iJay  View,  Agricultural  College  and  Alma,  should  not  be  forgotten  by  those 
who  desire  instruction  during  the  long  vacation.  The  State  teachers'  institute 
already  mentioned,  also  county  teachers'  association,  are  doing  much  and  stimu- 
late to  better   and   more   professional   labor. 

KINDERGARTEN   METHOD 

for  the  children  of  the  lower  grades.  The  introduction  of  this  kind  of  instruc- 
tion is  of  comparatively  recent  date  and  its  value  to  the  schools  of  the  State  can- 
not be  overestimated.  The  legislature  of  1891  very  wisely  passed  an  act  making 
it  lawful  for  any  school  board  in  the  State  to  provide  a  suitable  room  and  neces- 
sary apparatus  for  this  work.  The  same  act  provides  that  the  district  board  may 
require  teachers  to  be  qualified  to  give  such  instruction  in  addition  to  the  other 
qualifications  required.  By  this  act  children  between  the  ages  of  four  and  seven 
are  entitled  to  instruction   in   the  kindergarten   department. 

The  education  of  the  body  should  go  hand  in  hand  with  the  training  of  the 
mind,  for  worse  than  an  untrained  mind  in  a  healthy  body  is  an  educated  mind 
in  a  body  broken  down  with  overstudy,  poor  ventilation  and  improper  light. 
The  educators  of  Michigan,  aware  of  the  fact  that  good  health  is  necessary  for 
happiness,  have  adopted 

PHYSICAL   TRAINING 

as  a  part  of  high  school  and  college  courses  and  no  school  course  is  considered 
symmetrical  or  complete  without  exercise  with  dumb  bells,  Indian  clubs,  march- 
ing, calisthenics,  drill,  etc.,  and  to  the  credit  of  our  law  makers  we  may  add 
that  $20,000  for  a  building  for  physical  training  at  the  State  Normal  School  was 
appropriated  during  the  session  of  1893.  The  health  of  the  Michigan  boy  and  girl 
has  become  the  first  question  to  be  considered  by  the  professional  teacher. 

MUSIC   AND   DRAWING 

is  fast  becoming  a  part  of  the  course  of  study  in  our  larger  graded  schools. 
Besides  being  taught  to  some  extent  in  nearly  all  graded  schools,  forty  villages 
and  cities  in  the  State  in  1892  employed  special  teachers  in  music  and  about  the 
same  number  of  schools  employed  special  drawing  teachers.  In  a  nut  shell  we 
have: 

Seven  thousand  one  hundred  and  seventy-five  school  districts. 

Seven  thousand  six  hundred  and  sixty-six  school  houses. 

Sixteen  thousand  one  hundred  teachers  employed. 

Six  hundred  and  seventy-four  thousand,  two  hundred  and  seventy-nine  chile"  ,- 
of  school  age. 

Parochial  schools  in  large  cities. 

Twenty  or  more  private  schools  (business  colleges,  normal   schools). 

Seventeen  incorporated   colleges  and  schools. 

School  for  Feeble  Minded  and  Epiletic  (established  in  1893).

In  considering  what  has  been  accomplished  and  what  is  being  done  in  the  line  of 
progress  in  the  State,  we  feel  that  educational  interests  have  not  suffered  and  that 
the  founders  of  our  State  government  did  their  work  wisely.  To  them  we  say, 
"  well  done."  Men  or  institutions  founded  by  them  are  not  perfect.  Conditions 
change  and  the  system  so  nearly  perfect  must  undergo  changes  to  keep  pace  with 
the  progress  of  the  age.  Schools  in  cities  and  villages  are  kept  abreast  of  the 
times  by  election  of  capable  men  to  places  on  the  school  board  while  in  many 
■country  districts  men  who  can  be  persuaded  to  accept  the  offer  are  selected.  Such 
selections  many  times  are  made  from  the  ranks  of  those  who  have  only  an  indif- 
ferent interest  in  the  welfare  of  the  school.  For  this  and  other  reasons  the  schools 
should  be  changed  from  district  to 

TOWNSHIP   CONTROL. 

This  change  in  our  school  system  is  desirable  and  when  the  people  of  a  town- 
ship can  be  convinced  that  their  schools  will  be  better  managed  by  a  board  of 
five  or  more  representative  men  elected  by  the  people  of  the  township  instead 
•of  three  school  officers  in  each  of  the  several  districts,  making  in  some  town- 
ships thirty  or  forty  school  officers,  we  may  hope  for  better  schools  without  nec- 
cessarily  incurring  greater   expense. 

Last,  but  by  no  means  least,  children  in  the  schools  of  Michigan   are  taught 

PATRIOTISM. 

In  the  reading  books,  in  stories  of  American  history,  in  patriotic  recitations 
And  songs,  in  exercises  with  flags,  and  in  pole  raisings,  the  boys  and  girls  are 
taught  a  reverence  for  "  Old  Glory,"  and  over  many  a  school  house  from  the  fer- 
tile fields  of  the  south  to  the  pines  and  mines  of  the  north  "  The  Star  Spangled 
Banner  Triumphantly  Waves." 


THE  STATE  UNIVERSITY. 


BY  J.    H.    WADE,   SECRETARY. 


The  University  of  Michigan  has  for  years  maintained  its  position  as  one  of 
the  first  of  American  educational  institutions.  It  is  strong  in  the  breadth  of  its 
fundamental  plan,  the  practical   usefulness  of   its    work,  the    value  of  its  contri- 


140  Michigan  and  its  Kesoukces. 

butions  to  the  general  stock  of  knowledge,  the  ample  character  of  its  equipment, 
the  cheapness  with  which  its  advantages  can  be  enjoyed  and  its  thoroughly 
democratic  atmosphere. 

ITS  REMARKABLE  DEVELOPMENT. 

It  was  first  opened  to  the  public  in  1841,  and  hence  has  had  an  active  existence 
of  fifty-two  years.  "Within  that  time  its  corps  of  three  instructors  has  grown  to 
one  hundred  and  sixty-five  instructors  and  assistants,  and  its  list  of  students, 
which  in  its  first  catalog  contained  about  fifty-three  names,  has  reached  nearly 
twenty-eight  hundred.  Originally  a  more  local  school,  unknown  beyond  the  limits 
of  the  State,  it  has  won  an  international  reputation,  and  its  rolls  have  borne  the 
names  of  students  from  all  parts  of  the  United  States  and  from  many  foreign 
countries. 

ITS   LOCATION,    BUILDINGS   AND   DEPARTMENTS. 

The  University  is  located  in  the  city  of  Ann  Arbor,  thirty-eight  miles  west  of 
Detroit,  on  the  Michigan  Central  railroad.  Fifteen  buildings  are  situated  upon  a 
high  plateau  in  a  campus  of  forty  acres  in  extent.  The  astronomical  observatory 
and  the  two  hospitals  are  on  the  high  bluff  overlooking  the  Huron  valley.  The 
University  now  contains  the  following  departments:  1.  The  department  of  litera- 
ture, science  and  the  arts,  embracing,  a,  graduate  school;  6,  the  collegiate  work; 
c,  the  work  in  engineering.  2.  The  department  of  medicine  and  surgery.  3.  The 
department  of  law.  4.  The  school  of  pharmacy.  5.  The  homeopathic  medical 
college.  6.  The  college  of  dental  surgery.  Each  of  these  departments  has  its 
faculty  of   instruction,  who  are  charged   with   its  special   management. 

TERMS   OF   ADMISSION. 

All  students  on  entering  pay^a  matriculation  fee,  which  to  residents  of  the  State 
is  $10,  and  to  non-residents  $25.  This  fee  entitles  the  student  to  all  the  privi- 
leges of  permanent  membership.  The  annual  fees  are  as  follows:  In  the  literary - 
department,  $20  for  residents  and  $25  for  non-residents;  in  the  professional  schools, 
$25  and  $35.  When  a  degree  is  taken  a  diploma  fee  of  $10  must  be  paid.  Board 
and  rooms  are  obtainable  in  private  families  at  Ann  Arbor  at  from  $3  to  $5  per 
week;  rooms  without  board  at  from  75  cents  to  $2  per  week.  Students  by  form- 
ing clubs  can  bring  their  expenses  within  the  weekly  range  of  from  $2  to  $3' 
Those  who  do  not  care  to  become  candidates  for  regular  degrees  may  take  optional 
courses,  pursuing  only  such  studies  as  they  may  select.  Women  are  admitted  to 
all  branches  of  the  University  on  the  same  terms  as  men. 

LENGTH   OF   TERMS. 

The  regular  term  in  the  collegiate  department  covers  four  years,  in  the  med- 
ical schools  four  years,  in  the  dental  school  three  years  and  in  the  law  school 
and  in   the  pharmacy  school   two  years  each.

THE    MUSEUMS   AND   LABORATOKIES. 

The  museums  contain  large  collections  in  natural  history,  agriculture,  archaeology, 
ethnology,  the  line  arts,  history,  anatomy  and  materia  medica.  In  the  laborato- 
ries opportunities  are  provided  for  practical  instruction  in  physics,  chemistry,  geol- 
ogy,  zoology,   animal   morphology,   botany,   physiology   and   dentistry. 

THE    HOSPITALS. 

In  the  hospitals  facilities  are  afforded  to  medical  students  for  instruction  by 
clinics.  Patients  are  received  in  them  and  treated  without  charge  except  for  med- 
icines and  board,  and  all  persons  suffering  from  diseases  of  any  kind,  except  those 
of  a  contagious  character,  are  granted  admission. 

ATTENDANCE  IN  1893. 

The  total  enrollment  of  students  in  all  departments  in  March,  1893,  was  as 
follows: 

Department  of  literature,  science  and  the  arts 1,491 

Department  of  medicine  and  surgery 344 

Department  of  law 639 

School   of   pharmacy 82 

Homeopathic  medical   college 63 

College  of   dental   surgery 189 

2,808 
Deduct  for  names  counted  twice 30 

Total  attendance 2,778 

Of  the  foregoing  1,405  were  residents  of  Michigan;  the  others  came  not  only  from 
other  states  and  territories,  but  from  foreign  countries,  including  the  British  North 
American  provinces,  the  Hawaiian  islands,  the  Burmuda  islands,  England,  Japan, 
Germany,  China,  Italy,  Barbadoes,  Bulgaria.  Costa  Rica,  Porto  Rico,  Scotland  and 
South  Africa. 

THE    POOR    man's    UNIVERSITY. 

This  institution,  with  its  ample  equipment  and  its  numerous  courses  of  study,  is 
emphatically  the  poor  man's  university.  All  its  advantages  are  open  at  merely 
nominal  fees  to  any  qualified  applicant.  With  personal  economy  the  student  can 
support  himself  during  the  collegiate  year  with  but  small  expenditure.  Not  a  few 
of  those  today  in  attendance  there  are  paying  their  own  way  without  assistance 
from  parents  or  others.  Labor  is  not  despised  at  the  University,  and  the  cases 
have  been  numerous  where  young  men  in  straitened  circumstances  have  sought 
and  obtained  employment  at  Ann  Arbor  and  with  the  wages  thus  earned  aided 
materially  their  struggle  after  knowledge.  Among  the  chief  sources  of  the  Univer- 
sity's strong  hold  upon  the  affections  of  the  people  who  have  so  liberally  sup- 
ported it  must  be  reckoned  this  fact,  that  it  shares  so  fully  in  the  thoroughly 
democratic  spirit  of  the   primary  schools.

THE  MICHIGAN  AGRICULTURAL  COLLEGE. 

BY    PEESIDENT   O.    CLUTE. 

The  Agricultural  College  was  incorporated  in  1855.  A  few  months  later  the 
present  site  was  chosen,  which  is  three  and  one-half  miles  east  of  Lansing.  Con- 
tracts were  soon  let  for  a  main  building,  a  boarding  hall,  a  small  brick  barn  and 
four  small  cottages  for  professors'  residences.  These  buildings  were  so  far  com- 
pleted as  to  enable  the  college  to  open  in  May,  1857,  under  the  presidency  of  Hon. 
Joseph  R.  Williams. 

President  Williams  was  a  modern  man.  In  him  the  ideas  of  the  new  education 
had  come  to  full  growth.  He  believed  in  a  healthful,  well  trained  body,  a  care- 
fully educated  mind  in  which  all  the  faculties  should  be  thoroughly  trained,  and  a 
keen  moral  nature,  no  less  willing  to  grant  to  others  their  rights  than  to  claim  its 
own.  He  had  been  an  early  friend  of  the  Agricultural  College  before  the  law  was 
passed  for  its  organization.  He  desired  that  the  school  should  educate  men,  give 
them  strong  bodies,  skillful  hands,  well  trained  minds,  pure  morals. 

To  train  the  body  he  relied  on  the  farm  and  garden  work,  where  young  men 
should  come  into  direct  contact  with  soil  and  sun  and  by  struggle  with  nature 
learn  to  conquer  nature.  To  train  the  mind  he  looked  to  the  study  of  the  native 
tongue,  of  the  great  laws  of  mathematics  permeating  all  nature  through  the  power 
of  the  omnicient  geometrician,  and  to  a  study  of  those  great  sciences  which  do  but 
reveal  to  us  the  thoughts  and  methods  of  the  omnipresent  energy.  To  train  the 
morals  he  depended  on  attrition  of  man  with  man  and  on  the  ever  present  influ- 
ence of  pure  character  in  companions,  professors  and  instructors. 

He  was  followed  in  the  presidency  by  Dr.  T.  C.  Abbot,  whose  convictions  were 
in  the  same  channel,  whose  methods  were  similar.  To  those  two  men  the  college 
owes  its  modern  spirit,  its  rational  methods,  its  success  which  has  been  slowly 
won,  but  which  is  as  solid  as  the  hills. 

When  the  college  was  first  established  it  was  an  agricultural  school,  but  after 
congress  passed  the  Morrill  act  of  1862,  its  provisions  were  accepted  by  Michigan, 
which  made  it  necessary  to  add  a  course  in  mechanic  arts  to  the  course  in  agri- 
culture, and  now  the  college  has  these  two  courses  and  no  others.  Its  "leading 
object"  is  to  teach  agriculture  and  the  mechanic  arts. 

For  this  work  it  is  now  well  equipped.  In  the  thirty-five  years  of  its  life  it  has 
subdued  the  forest  and  made  fertile  farm,  gardens  and  orchards.  Gradually  there 
have  grown  up  many  laboratories,  barns,  dormitories  and  dwellings.  Its  land, 
buildings  and  equipment  have  cost  $450,000.  Its  library  has  18,000  volumes.  The 
facilities  for  imparting  instruction  in  all  its  departments  are  superior.  Its  profes- 
sors are  strong  men,  devoted  to  their  work. 

The  value  of  its  work  is  shown  by  results.  The  students  trained  in  its  classes 
become  men  of  force.  They  can  work  and  win.  A  large  per  cent  of  them  become 
agriculturists  or  mechanics.  Those  who  take  up  other  branches  have  the  constant 
industry  and  the  trained  judgment  that  bring  success. 

Those  desiring  further  information  are  invited  to  address  the  president.  Agri- 
cultural  College  P.  O.,   Michigan.

MICHIGAN  MINING   SCHOOL. 


BY   M.   E.    WADS  WORTH. 


This  institution  was  established  by  the  legislature  of  Michigan  in  18S5,  and  first 
opened  for  the  admission  of  students  Sept.  15,  1886. 

The  object  of  the  school  is  to  give  instruction  in  all  subjects  relating  to  the 
development  of  the  mineral  wealth  of  the  country,  and  it  has  confined  itself  strictly 
to  its  original  purpose.  In  carrying  out  the  designs  of  its  founders,  both  theoret- 
ical and  practical  instruction  is  provided  for  in  the  various  subjects  of  mathematics, 
physics,  drawing,  blue  printing,  graphical  statics,  designing,  chemistry,  assaying, 
ore  dressing,  metallurgy,  properties  and  mechanics  of  materials,  mechanism,  shop 
practice,  mechanical,  electrical,  hydraulic,  structural  and  mining  engineering,  sur- 
veying, mining,  crystallography,  mineralogy,  petrography,  paleontology,  and  struct- 
ural, physical,  economic  and  field  geology. 

The  laboratories,  shops,  and  mill  are  well  equipped  for  giving  instruction  in  the 
subjects  named,  and  every  advantage  practicable  is  taken  of  the  location  and  equip- 
ment of  the  school  to  make  the  instruction  practical,  and  enable  the  student  to 
learn  that  which  he  can  use  in  his  subsequent  work.  On  account  of  this,  the 
Mining  School  is  conducted  strictly  as  a  professional  school,  the  same  as  are  the  ^ 
theological,  law  and  medical  schools  of  the  country,  and  no  encouragement  is  given 
to  any  student  to  enter  or  remain  in  it  who  is  not  thoroughly  in  earnest  to  master 
the  studies  relating  to  his  chosen  profession. 

Its  course  of  instruction  comprises  three  or  four  years,  at  the  option  of  the 
pupil. 

The  three  years  course  embraces  most  of  the  subjects  required  in  the  ordinary 
work  of  the  mining  engineer,  and  on  its  completion  the  degree  of  bachelor  of  sci- 
ence (B.  S.)  is  given.  For  those  who  desire  it  an  additional  year  is  taken,  making 
the  four  years  course,  which  comprises  many  of  the  advanced  and  higher  subjects 
of  the  mining  engineer's  profession. 

The  course  of  study  requires  from  the  pupil  from  six  to  seven  hours  a  day,  five 
days  a  week,  in  the  class  room,  laboratory,  mill  or  mine,  and  all  preparation  for 
his  daily  work  has  to  be  done  outside  of  these  hours,  hence  a  student  needs  to 
give  nearly  all  of  his  available  time  to  his  work  if  he  expects  to  do  well.  The 
course  in  its  first  and  third  years  occupies  forty-five  weeks  of  the  year,  and  in  the 
second  and  fourth  years  forty-four  weeks  of  the  year;  but  in  the  fourth  year  six 
of  the  weeks  are  devoted  to  the  preparation  of  a  thesis,  which  is  required  before 
the  student  can  receive  the  degree  of  mining  engineer. 

The  Michigan  Mining  School  has  advanced  more  rapidly  than  any  other  State 
or  independent  school  of  mining  engineering  in  the  United  States,  having  for  some 
three  years  more  students  in  mining  engineering  than  any  other  school  in  the 
country.  During  the  past  year  ninety-two  pupils  have  been  enrolled  from  twenty 
different  states  and  foreign  countries. 

The  demand  for  its  graduates  has  been  good  and  in   advance   of   the  supply,  and 
every  effort  practical  has  been  made  to  give   the    kind    of    an    education    that    the 
modern  mining  engineer  needs  at   the  present  time. 
The  Mining  School  is  under  the  direction  of  a  board  of  control  consisting  of  six

During  its  first  year  the  school  was  under  the  direction  of  Albert  Williams,  Jr., 
and  since  then  under  that  of  M.  E.  Wadsworth. 

The  main  building  now  occupied  by  the  Mining  School  was  completed  by  the 
State  in  1889,  at  a  cost  of  $75,000.  The  building  is  constructed  of  Portage  entry 
sandstone,  with  a  tile  roof.  It  is  heated  and  ventilated  by  steam,  having  two 
large  boilers  for  heating  and  an  extra  boiler  for  driving  machinery. 

The  main  building  is  one  hundred  and  nine  feet  by  fifty-three  feet,  with  a 
wing  thirty-seven  feet  by  twenty-five  feet.  A  well  appointed  stamp  mill  and  ore 
dressing  works,  a  small  metallurgical  building,  etc.,  complete  the  structures  belong- 
ing to  the  Mining  School. 

A  new  building  for  the  accommodation  of  the  mechanical,  electrical  and  mining 
engineering,  and  drawing  and  surveying  will  be  erected  in  1893-1894,  and  the  inter- 
ior of  the  main  building  remodeled  to  meet  the  increasing  needs  of  the  school 
developed  by  its  rapid  increase  in  numbers. 

The  library  has  been  especially  selected  for  the  technical  and  other  needs  of  the 
school  and  numbers  some  nine  thousand  volumes,  while  the  reading  room  contains 
all  the  important  and  technical  periodicals  that  bear  on  the  subjects  taught  in  the 
school. 

The  physical  laboratory  is  well  equipped  with  the  special  apparatus  needed  in 
the  student's  practical  work,  like  galvanometers  of  various  kinds,  calorimeters, 
resistance  boxes,  spectragonimeters,  spherometers,  balances,  bridges,  sextants,  sonom- 
eters, polariscopes,  electric  motors,  photometers,  etc.,  etc. 

In  chemistry  there  are  two  laboratories,  one  for  general  chemistry  and  qual- 
itative analysis,  and  the  other  for  quantitative  analysis.  These  laboratories  are  well 
equipped  with  gas  and  water  supplies,  with  filter  pumps  for  each  student,  as  well 
as  with  all  the  needed  modern  apparatus  for  chemical  work,  including  thirteen 
analytical  balances,  spectroscopes,  Hempel's  and  Bunsen's  apparatus,  etc. 

The  assay  laboratory  is  fitted  with  ten  large  crucible  furnaces,  eighteen  Brown's 
muffle  furnaces,  sixteen  Hoskin's  gasoline  crucible  and  muffle  furnaces;  Blake's  and 
Gates'  crushers,  large  buck  plates,  large  and  small  mortars,  sieves,  etc.,  as  well  as 
six  pulp  scales  and  five  button  balances.  The  mill  and  ore  dressing  works  are  well 
equipped  with  one  650-pound  three-stamp  battery,  for  wet  or  dry  crushing,  furnished 
with  copper  plates,  one  Blake   crusher,  one   sample    grinder,  one   pair  of  rolls,   one

addition  to  these  more  expensive  instruments,  the  school  owns  the  necessary  num- 
ber of  mining  lamps,  chains,  steel  tapes,  poles,  rods,  etc. 

Two  of  the  transits  are  provided  with  three  tripod  outfits  for  mine  surveying,, 
and  all  the  transits  are  adapted  to  mine  as  well  as  surface  work. 

The  laboratories  for  crystallography,  mineralogy,  petrography  and  geology  are 
well  equipped  and  prepared  for  both  elementary  and  advanced  students.  Amongst 
other  material  these  laboratories  have  the  following:

Also  thirty-eight  petrographical  microscopes  with  accessories,  spectroscopes,  goni- 
ometers, polariscopes,  etc. 

The  Michigan  Mining  School  is  located  at  Houghton,  the  county  seat  of  Hough- 
ton county,  a  county  which  stands  third  in  valuation  in  the  State.  Houghton  is 
easily  reached  by  rail  from  Detroit,  Grand  Rapids,  Lansing,  Chicago,  Milwaukee, 
St.  Paul,  Superior  and  Duluth,  and  by  steamer  from  all  the  important  ports  on  the 
chain  of  the  great  lakes. 

In  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  Mining  School  are  located  the  Quincy,  Atlantic, 
Franklin  and  Huron  copper  mines,  while  within  a  distance  of  fifteen  miles  are  sit- 
uated the  Calumet  and  Hecla,  Tamarack,  Osceola  and  other  copper  mines,  with 
their  machine  shops,  smelting  works,  rolling  and  stamp  mills,  etc.  In  the  iron 
mining  regions  lie  numerous  great  iron  mines,  prominent  among  which  are  the 
Cleveland,  Jackson,  Lake  Superior,  Lake  Angeline,  Champion,  Republic,  Chapin, 
Vulcan,  Cyclops,  Colby  and  Norrie. 

From  this  location  the  student  of  the  Michigan  Mining  School  is  placed  in  a 
mining  atmosphere,  in  which  all  his  surroundings  and  associations  are  in  con- 
formity with  his  present  and  future  work.  He  is  thus  enabled  to  see  in  actual 
operation  some  of  the  most  successful  and  extensive  mining  operations  now  con- 
ducted anywhere. 

No  fees  of  any  kind  are  charged,  the  school  being  absolutely  free  to  all  persons 
from  whatsoever  state  or  country  they  may  come. 

Catalogs  containing  full  particulars  concerning  the  requirements  for  admission, 
course  of  study,  etc.,  can  be  obtained  by  an  application  by  mail  or  in  person  to 
the  director  at  Houghton. 


MICHIGAN  STATE  NORMAL  SCHOOL. 

BY   DANIEL   PUTNAM,    YPSILANTI,   MICHIGAN. 

This  institution  is  located  in  the  city  of  Ypsilanti.  It  was  opened  and  its  first 
building  was  dedicated  on  October  5,  1852,  being  the  first  normal  school  estab- 
lished west  of  New  York.  It  is  under  the  control  of  the  State  Board  of  Edu- 
cation, and  its  sole  purpose  is  to  prepare  teachers  for  all  grades  of  the  public 
schools  of  the  State. 

Its  buildings  are  ample  and  are  well  adapted  to  the  work  of  the  school.  Its 
general  assembly  hall  affords  seating  for  nearly  a  thousand  persons;  the  chem- 
ical, physical  and  biological  laboratories  are  excellent,  and  are  supplied  with 
the  best  of  apparatus.  It  has  a  carefully  selected  general  library  of  thirteen 
thousand  volumes,  and  a  reading  room  supplied  with  all  the  leading  literary  and 
educational  magazines  of  this  country,  and  a  considerable  number  of  foreign  edu- 
cational periodicals.  In  addition  to  the  general  library  there  are  departmental 
libraries  selected  for  special  use  in  teaching  the  various  branches^ 

The  training  department,  embracing  a  kindergarten  and  all  the  grades  of  the 
primary  and  grammar  departments  of  a  regular  public  school,  affords  students  an 
opportunity   to  observe   model   teaching,  and  also  to  apply  in  practice,  under  care-

ful  supervision  and  criticism,  the  principles  and  methods  in  which  they  receive 
instruction. 

Connected  with  the  normal  school,  though  not  organically  a  part  of  it.  is  a  con- 
servatory of  music  which  affords  most  excellent  facilities  for  the  study  of  that 
important  branch  of  a  teacher's  education.  Vocal  music  and  voice  culture  are 
regular  studies  in  the  normal  courses. 

Several  courses  of  studies  are  provided  to  meet  the  wants  of  the  various  grades 
of  schools.  Courses  of  one  and  two  years  are  provided  for  graduates  of  approved 
high  schools;  and  it  is  the  policy  of  the  school  to  encourage  those  who  enter  to 
complete  as  much  as  possible  of  the  academic  work  before  entering.  A  purely 
professional  course  of  twenty  weeks  is  offered  to  graduates  of  colleges.  This 
course  leads  to  a  life  certificate  and  to  the  degree  of  bachelor  of  pedagogics. 
Students  completing  a  regular  thi-ee  years  course  receive  a  legal  certificate  enti- 
tling them  to  teach  in  the  schools  of  the  State  for  a  period  of  five  years;  graduates 
from  a  four  years  course  receive  life  certificates.  An  advanced  course  is  provided 
which  gives  the  graduate  from  it  the  degree  of  bachelor  of  pedagogics. 

The  faculty,  including  professors,  assistants  and  instructors,  numbers  thirty- 
seven,  and  will  probably  be  increased  during  the  next  year.  It  is  the  purpose  of 
the  board  to  secure  first-class  instruction  in  all  departments. 

The  demand  for  graduates  of  the  normal  in  the  schools  of  the  State  is  beyond 
the   capacity   of  the  school   to   supply   and   is  constantly   increasing. 

The  school  year  is  divided  into  two  terms  of  twenty  weeks  each,  the  first 
term  beginning   early   in  September,   the   second '  early   in    February. 

No  tuition  fee  is  charged;  but  students  not  holding  appointments  from  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Legislature  pay  an  incidental  admission  fee  of  five  dollars  each  term. 
Members  of  the  Legislature  are  authorized  to  appoint  two  students  from  their 
own  districts.     Such  students  pay   no  fee. 

The  living  expenses  of  students  are  very  moderate.  Furnished  rooms  can  be 
had  for  75  cents  to  $1.25  per  week.  Board  in  "clubs"  costs  about  $2  per 
week.  Board,  with  furnished  room,  in  private  families  can  be  obtained  at  rates 
varying  from  S.3  to  $4:  per  week. 


MICHIGAN  SCHOOL  FOR  THE   BLIND 

was  established  at  Lansing  in  1879.  It  had  formerly  been  connected  with  the  deaf 
and  dumb  institution.  The  number  of  students  in  1892  was  85,  number  of 
instructors  9.  It  is  under  the  management  of  the  special  board  of  control.  No 
one  possessing  fully  developed  feelings  of  humanity  can  visit  this  institution  with- 
out experiencing  sensations  of  pity  upon  seeing  so  many  innocent  youths  deprived 
of  the  greatest  of  all  blessings,  with  the  sunlight  and  beauties  of  God's  universe 
eternally  shut  out,  groping  their  way  in  physical  darkness  through  life  in 
presence  of  the  fact  that  it  is  a  question  with  many  whether  life  is  worth  living. 
If  there  are  any  deep  grounds  for  this  question  with  all  the  senses  and  faculties 
to  enjoy  life  it  would  seem  to  be  easily  settled  by  the  deprivation  of  the  sense  of 
sight. 

The  object  of  this  institution   is  to  so   train  the   intellect,   through  which   alone 


150  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

the  other  senses  would  be  reached,  that  great  pleasures  may  be  experienced  by 
these  unfortunates.  They  learn  to  read  by  the  sense  of  touch  and  become  excel- 
lent musicians.  They  are  also  trained  to  make  many  articles  useful  and  orna- 
mental. With  the  many  attainments  and  accomplishments  acquired  at  the  school, 
life  is  relieved  of  the  monotonies  of  an  uneducated  blind  person. 


MICHIGAN  SCHOOL  FOR  DEAF  MUTES. 

This  institution  was  established  in  1854.  Prior  to  1879  the  blind  as  well  as  deaf 
mutes  were  instructed  in  the  same  building,  but  provisions  were  made  to  separate 
them. 

The  institution  for  the  deaf  mutes  is  located  at  Flint,  in  Genesee  county.  The 
total  value  of  the  property  is  about  450,000,  which  includes  eighty-eight  acres  of 
land  and  excellent   buildings. 

The  object  of  the  institution  is  to  educate  deaf  mutes  and  fit  them  for  useful 
and  remunerative  occupations,  thereby  rendering  them  independent. 

The  State  maintains  this  institution  with  the  same  liberality  it  extends  to  all  its 
similar  institutions  and  the  result  commends  the  plan.  Many  who  would  be  bur- 
dens on  their  friends  or  the  State  are  instructed  and  trained  so  skillfully  that  they 
become  educated  and  competent  to  earn  good  livings.  No  charge  is  made  to  pupils 
in  Michigan  and,  indeed,  the  State  authorizes  the  trustees  to  assist  the  poor  unfort- 
unates when  needed.  The  institution  accomplishes  what  it  would  be  almost 
utterly  impossible  to  otherwise  do.  The  State  will  never  forget  or  neglect  its 
unfortunates. 


STATE  PUBLIC   SCHOOL. 

The  State  Public  School  is  located  at  Coldwater,  Branch  county,  and  was  estab- 
lished in  1871  and  opened  in  1874.  It  is  a  temporary  home  for  dependent  and  ill- 
treated  children,  between  the  ages  of  two  and  twelve  years. 

The  object  of  the  institution  is  to  take  care  of  and  educate  such  children  until 
homes  can  be  found  for  them  in  good  families. 

Since  the  institution  was  established  3,-331  children  have  been  received,  most  of 
whom  have  been  provided  with  good  homes.  There  are  now  about  two  hundred  in 
the  school.  There  is  a  farm  of  130  acres  connected  with  the  institution.  The 
management  is  vested  in  a  board  and  there  are  six  teachers  and  three  officers. 
Two  hundred  and  fifty  children  can  be  accommodated.  Two  thousand  five  hundred 
and  ninety-one  have  been  indentured,  one  hundred  and  fourteen  have  died,  four 
hundred  and  seventeen  returned  to  counties. 

The  State  may  well  be  proud  of  an  institution  having  for  its  object  the  care 
and  training  of  poor,  homeless,  destitute  waifs,  snatching  innocents  from  the 
recruiting  sources  of  vice  and  crime  and  placing  them  on  the  road  to  virtue  and 
usefulness.  In  the  future  our  citizenship  must  necessarily  be  composed  of  the 
children  of  today.  Michigan  is  proverbial  for  helping  those  who  cannot  help 
themselves.

MICHIGAN  MILITARY  ACADEMY. 

The  Michigan  Military  Academy  was  incorporated  September  4,  1877.  The  aim 
of  this  institution  is  to  give  young  men  an  education,  both  physical  and  mental, 
which  shall  develop  them  into  the  fullest  and  highest  manhood;  an  education 
which  shall  produce,  as  far  as  possible,  full  and  perfect  men.  To  this  end,  the 
school  is  established  upon  a  system  that  combines  military  instruction  with  the 
ordinary  courses  of  high  schools  and  academies. 

The  Academy  is  situated  twenty-six  miles  from  Detroit  and  four  and  one-half 
miles  from  Pontiac,  with  which  it  is  connected  by  railroad.  The  grounds,  compris- 
ing one  hundred  and  twenty  acres,  are  on  the  shore  of  Orchard  lake,  in  one  of  the 
most  beautiful  and  healthful  localities  in  Michigan.  The  buildings  are  all  new,  of 
brick,  and  built  expressly  for  the  purpose  for  which  they  are  used.  There  are 
already  six  modern  buildings,  well  lighted  and  ventilated,  and  complete  in  every 
respect.    Value  of  buildings  and  grounds,  $300,000. 

From  the  location  of  the  Academy  all  the  benefits  of  country  life  are  secured, 
and  the  cadets  are  free  from  the  temptations  and  distractions  of  the  city.  The 
Academy  has  every  advantage  to  make  it  especially  good— location,  healthfulness, 
rational  methods,  thoroughness  and  progressive  spirit. 

The  special  work  of  the  Academy  is  to  prepare  for  our  best  universities,  and  to 
give  an  extended  course  to  those  not  intending  to  go  to  college.  Courses  of 
instruction  are  offered  in  the  preparation  for  the  college  courses  leading  to  the 
degrees  of  bachelor  of  arts,  philosophy,  science,  letters,  and  for  the  courses  in  civil, 
mechanical,  mining  and  electrical  engineering.  In  chemistry,  electricity,  law,  his- 
tory, mathematics,  English,  Latin,  Greek,  French  and  German,  opportunity  is  given 
at  the  Academy  for  advanced  work. 

Students  in  attendance,  one  hundred  and  forty.  Number  of  graduates,  one  hun- 
dred and  ninety-five. 

Col.  E.  M.  Heyl,  U.  S.  A.  Inspector  General,  Division  of  Missouri,  in  his  annual 
report  for  1892  to  the  Inspector  General  at  Washington,  says  in  regard  to  this 
Academy: 

"The  Michigan  Military  Academy  at  Orchard  lake,  has,  by  its  high  grade  of 
scholarship  and  its  strenuous  efforts  for  the  best  success,  achieved  a  place  second 
to  none  in  the  country." — Extract  from  Contributions  to  the  American  Educa- 
tional History,  1892,  Bureau  of  Education,  Washington,  D.  C. 

This  Academy  still  maintains  its  place  as  the  leading  military  institution  of  the 
country  outside  of  West  Point,  and  in  all  its  details  it  is  the  most  complete  and 
thorough  school  of  the  kind  I  have  ever  inspected.  The  State  may  well  be  proud 
of  Orchard  Lake  Military  Academy,  and  the  young  men  it  graduates,  as  they  will 
toe  the  material  on  which  the  country  can  rely  in  the  event  of  war. 

The   site  is  most  excellent  and  the  sanitary  condition  and  sewerage  perfect."

AKELEY  INSTITUTE. 

This  institute  was  founded  by  Hon.  H.  C.  Akeley  and  is  located  at  Grand 
Haven,  on  the  banks  of  Lake  Michigan.  It  was  Mr.  Akeley's  belief  that  girls 
should  not  obtain  classical  education  at  the  expense  of  physical  strength  and 
development.  Three  principal  features  are  cared  for:  Mental  advancement,  physi- 
cal development  and  moral  culture;  and  the  regime  in  all  departments  is  so  inter- 
woven  and   blended   that   the   results   are  remarkably  satisfactory. 


BATTLE   CREEK  COLLEGE. 

Battle  Creek  College  was  founded  in  1874,  by  the  Seventh  Day  Adventists 
Educational  Society,  and  was  duly  incorporated  in  the  same  year,  according  to 
the  laws  of  the  State  of  Michigan  providing  for  the  incorporation  of  institu- 
tions of  learning.  It  is  a  denominational  institution,  designed  to  give  young 
people  a  liberal  education  and  prepare  them  for  usefulness  in  the  different  lines 
of  religious  work.  Its  managers  aim  to  make  moral  and  religious  influences 
prominent,  and  thoroughness  of  instruction,  solidity  of  character  and  usefulness 
in  life  the  principal  objects  of  attainment.  They  hope  to  have  a  school  where 
the  fear  of  God  will  prevail,  where  His  holy  word  will  be  reverenced,  and  where 
His  worship  and  service  will  be  respected;  where  the  young  will  receive  dis- 
cipline and  instruction  which  will  qualify  them  for  the  duties  of  life,  and  make 
them  a  benefit  to  their  fellow  men.  Such  as  desire  to  be  in  harmony  with 
these  objects   are  heartily   invited   to   attend. 

LOCATION. 

The  college  is  situated  in  Battle  Creek,  a  city  of  about  15,000  inhabitants  and 
one  of  the  most  active  and  enterprising  towns  in  the  peninsular  State.  Being 
at  the  junction  of  the  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk,  Michigan  Central,  and  Cincin- 
nati, Jackson  &amp;  Mackinaw  railroads,  about  half  way  between  Detroit  and  Chicago, 
the  city  is  easy  of  access  from  all  parts  of  the  country.  The  site  of  the  college 
is  on  a  fine  eminence  in  the  western  part  of  the  city,  about  one-half  of  a  mile 
from   the  business   center. 

GROUNDS   AND   BUILDINGS. 

The  college  campus  consists  of  seven  acres,  about  half  of  which  is  taken  up 
with  buildings  and  the  lawn,  and  the  remainder  gives  abundant  room  for  out- 
of  door   sports. 

THE    HOME    LIFE. 

Past    experience    has    demonstrated    that    the   school   can   be   more  successfully 
carried    on    by    having    the    students    board    and    room    in    the   college  buildings, 
with  the   members  of    the    faculty,   thus  constituting  a  large   school  family.     The 
20

young  people  should  receive  a  much  broader  training  than  that  which  comes 
merely  from  the  study  of  books.  It  is  the  best  time  for  them  to  form  habits 
of  neatness  and  christian  courtesy,  and  to  obtain  that  general  culture  which 
comes  from  daily  and  intimate  association  with  educated  christian  teachers. 
Much  care  is  taken  to  render  the  home  life  vnot  only  attractive,  but  efficient  in 
the  cultivation  of  those  habits  of  life  and  graces  of  character  which  distinguish 
the  refined  christian  man  and  woman.  Teachers  and  students  share  one  family 
life,  with  common  aims  and  interest.  The  regulations  are  reasonable,  and  are 
adapted  to  secure  trust,  freedom  and  happiness.  It  is  intended  that  every  student 
shall  enjoy  the  pleasant  associations,  and  receive  the  personal  care  of  a  true 
home.  All  the  students  in  the  college  buildings  will  be  required  to  aid  in  part 
payment  of  their  expenses,  in  the  work  connected  with  the  boarding  hall  and 
the  laundry  and  in  the  care  of  the  grounds  and  buildings.  This  service  will 
occupy  one  hour  each  day.  Much  valuable  information  and  discipline  are  thus 
secured  to  the  student.  Sharing  the  daily  duties,  and  bearing  mutual  responsi- 
bilities for  the  common  good,  have  proved  to  be  of  great  educational  value  in 
establishing  health  and  developing  character.  The  influence  of  this  service, 
rendered  heartily,  is  invaluable  in  producing,  during  the  years  of  mental  train- 
ing, habits  of  accuracy,  self-reliance,  unselfishness  and  genuine  sympathy  with  all 
workers. 

After  several  years  of  experience  with  the  present  plan  of  the  home  life,  the 
managers  of  the  college  are  convinced  of  its  great  value  as  an  aid  in  the  proper 
development  of  christian  character  and  they  earnestly  recommend  that  all  parents 
residing  out  of  the  city,  who  send  their  sons  and  daughters  to  the  college,  make 
provision  for  them   to   live   at   the   school   home. 

Parents  are  assured  that  those  who  are  sent  here  to  work  for  their  board  are 
by  that  arrangement  deprived  in  a  large  degree  of  the  special  privileges  and 
benefits  which  they  might  otherwise  enjoy.  In  such  cases  the  faculty  cannot 
be  expected  to  take  that  responsibility  for  the  general  welfare  of  the  student 
which  they^  are  willing  to  assume  in  the  home. 

MUSEUM. 

In  addition  to  many  curious  and  interesting  articles  donated  by  friends  of  the 
college  in  different  parts  of  the  world,  the  museum  contains  a  set  of  Ward's  casts 
of  fossils,  and  quite  a  complete  line  of  specimens  illustrating  mineralogy  and  geol- 
ogy. The  college  desires  to  acknowledge  its  obligations  to  those  who  have  contrib- 
uted to  the  museum  in  the  past  and  to  request  a  continuance  of  their  favors.  A 
brief  sketch  of  any  article  forwarded  will  add  to  its  interest  and  value. 

LIBEAEY. 

The  library  consists  at  present  of  about  2,000  volumes  and  new  books  are  con- 
stantly being  added  to  its  list.  The  student  finds  this  medium  of  information  val- 
uable for  research  in  the  different  branches  of  study.  In  connection  with  the 
library  is  a  reading  room,  supplied  with  secular  and  religous  papers  and  magazines 
for  the  use  of  the  students. 


Educational.  155 


DISCIPLINE. 

Battle  Creek  College  aims  to  develop  character  of  the  highest  type  as  well  as 
scholarship  of  the  best  quality,  and  its  discipline  has  respect  to  these  ends.  Every 
effort  is  given  toward  making  the  student  self-reliant,  self-controlled  men  and 
women.  But  it  is  not  a  reform  school  and  its  patrons  should  not  send  to  this 
institution  young  people  too  incorrigible  to  be  governed  at  home.  If  any  of  this 
class  gain  admittance  they  may  expect  to  be  summarily  dismissed  as  soon  as  their 
true   character  is  discovered. 


HOPE   COLLEGE. 

Hope  College  is  located  at  Holland  City,  Ottawa  county.  The  college  campus 
contains  about  sixteen  acres  and  is  beautifully  situated  in  the  center  of  the  city, 
adjacent  to  Macatawa  bay,  on  which  is  located  Macatawa  park  and  Ottawa 
Beach,  popular  summer  resorts.  The  location  is  remarkably  healthy,  is  easy  of 
access  by  rail  and  water,  being  on  an  arm  of  Lake  Michigan  and  close  to  the 
great  lake.  The  prevailing  wind  is  from  the  west  and  consequently  the  college  is, 
with  breathing   air   fresh  from   the  lake,   always   pure   and   healthy. 

The  college  buildings  are  eight  in  number  and  more  are  being  built.  It  is  an  insti- 
tution of  the  reformed  church  largely  under  supervision  of  Hollanders,  who  are 
noted  for  sobriety,  honesty,  industry  and  enterprise.     Catalogs  furnished  by  college. 


ALMA    COLLEGE. 

BY    AUGUST    F.    BEUSKE,    PRESIDENT. 

This  is  the  youngest  of  the  family  of  christian  colleges  in  Michigan.  It  was 
founded  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  1886,  by  the  synod  of  Michigan  representing  the 
Presbyterian  church  of  the  United  States  of  America.  The  decision  to  establish 
it  in  Alma,  Gratiot  county,  was  reached  because  such  an  institution  was  most 
needed  by  the  central  and  northern  portions  of  our  State.  Almost  all  the  colleges 
are  in  the  southern  and  eastern  parts  of  Michigan,  leaving  over  one  million  of 
people  without  the  advantages  of  the  higher  christian  education.  These  people 
had  almshouses,  jails,  asylums,  penitentiaries,  and  now  they  have  also  a  college. 
Some  of  the  principal  promoters  of  the  enterprise  were  A.  W.  Wright,  Esq.,  of 
Alma,  who  gave  thirty  acres  of  land,  two  substantial  brick  buildings  at  the  begin- 
ning and  has  been  a  continual  giver  to  the  library  and  the  other  departments  -of 
college  work ;  Alexander  Folsom,  Esq.,  of  Bay  City,  who  gave  $80,000  toward 
endowment;  Thomas  Merrill,  Esq.,  of  Saginaw;  C.  W.  Wells,  Esq.,  F.  C.  Stone,  Esq., 
Charles  Davis,  Esq.,  all  of  Saginaw,  and  Hon.  John  Longyear,  of  Marquette.    By  the 


156  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

munificence  of  these  gentlemen  the  college  was  permitted  to  open  its  doors  in  1887 
and  start  at  once  upon  a  thrifty  and  vigorous  life.  Thirty-five  students  registered 
on  the  first  day.    The  total  attendance  last  year  was  one  hundred  and  seventy-two. 

The  faculty  for  instruction  is  composed  of  thirteen  ladies  and  gentlemen,  all 
having  enjoyed  special  training  and  having  demonstrated  their  fitness  by  previous 
experience  and  success  in  teaching  elsewhere.  The  institution  has  thirty  acres  of 
land,  four  brick  buildings,  substantial  and  essentially  fire  proof.  It  has  an  excellent 
library  of  23,000  volumes  and  pamphlets,  most  of  the  books  being  obtained  by 
purchase. 

Among  the  advantages  claimed  for  Alma  College  are: 

1.  Its  central  location,  easily  accessible,  being  at  the  junction  of  two  impor- 
tant railroads;  far  enough  from  any  similar  institution  to  deliver  it  from  unhappy 
rivalries,  in  a  region  of  fertile   country,  high  and  free  from  malaria. 

2.  To  thoroughly  competent  teachers,  to  the  best  of  facilities  by  way  of  library 
and  apparatus,  there  are  added  the  best  opportunities  for  moral  and  religious 
training.  A  course  of  bible  stories  embracing  the  geography,  biography  and  books 
of  the  bible,  the  contents  of  sacred  scripture,  and  finishing  with  natural  theol- 
ogy and  the  evidences  of  Christianity.  This,  it  is  believed,  must  stimulate  the 
religious  energies  and  build  up  character  as  is  not  possible  in  institutions  under 
the  control  of  the  State. 

3.  The  members  of  the  faculty  are  in  daily  and  familiar  association  with  the 
students  so  that  the  personal  wants  of  each  student  are  recognized  and  pro- 
vided for. 

The  following  are  the  courses  of  study:  1.  The  classical.  2.  Scientific.  3.  Philo- 
sophical. 4.  The  literary.  5.  Training  department  for  kindergarten  teachers. 
6.  The  commercial  for  those  wishing  a  business  education.  7.  The  musical 
deparment.  8.  The  art  department.  9.  The  college  preparatory.  10.  The  aca- 
demic for  those  desiring  a  short  course  of  two  or  three  years. 


CATHOLIC    SCHOOLS  AND   CHARITIES    IN    THE    DIOCESE   OF    GRAND 

RAPIDS,   MICHIGAN. 

The  diocese  of  Grand  Rapids,  Michigan,  lies  in  the  lower  peninsula  of  Mich- 
igan and  north  of  the  southern  boundaries  of  Ottawa,  Kent,  Montcalm,  Gratiot 
and  Saginaw    counties. 

Every  parish  in  the  cities  and  towns  has  a  school  attended  by  nearly  all  the 
Catholic  children  who  are  of  the  school  age.  The  total  number  of  school  houses 
is  forty-two.  The  attendance  at  these  during  the  year  1892  was  a  little  over  ten 
thousand,  taught  by  one  hundred  and  eighty  teachers,  all  of  whom,  except 
eighteen,  are  members  of  religious  orders.  In  the  upper  classes  of  several  schools 
in  the  cities  the  course  of  studies  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  high  schools. 

Grand  Rapids  and  Saginaw  have  each  six  school  houses;  Bay  City,  four;  Mus- 
kegon, Manistee  and  Alpena,  three;  West  Bay  City  and  Au  Sable,  two;  Big 
Rapids,  Ludington,    Traverse  City,  Provement,    Petoskey,    Harbor    Springs,    Cross 


Educational.  157 


Village,  Cheboygan,  Essexville,  Mount  Pleasant,  Maple  Grove,  Alpine  and  Wright 
are  each  supplied  with  one  school.  The  value  of  the  buildings  ranges  from  one 
thousand   dollars  to   twenty   thousand. 

Grand  Rapids  has  a  home  for  the  aged  poor,  with  nearly  one  hundred  inmates, 
in  charge  of  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor.  Less  than  one-half  of  the  projected 
building,  three  stories   with   a   basement,   has   been   erected. 

The  Sisters  of  Mercy  conduct  two  hospitals,  the  one  in  Big  Rapids,  the  other 
in  Manistee.  The  patients  in  both  are  mostly  from  the  lumber  camps.  Mr.  John 
Canfield,  of  Manistee,  donated  the  magnificent  hospital  in  the  city  of  his  residence 
to  the  Sisters  of   Mercy. 

The  Sisters  of  Charity  have  a  hospital  in  Saginaw.  The  old  hospital  is  a  frame 
building,  the  new,  of  which  one  wing  is  complete,  will  be  of  brick  and  cost  not 
less   than   one   hundred   thousand  dollars. 

St.  John's  Orphan  Asylum,  in  Grand  Rapids,  is  in  charge  of  the  Sisters  of 
St.  Dominic.  It  is  the  gift  of  the  late  John  Clancy.  Only  one  wing  is  built, 
housing  about  ninety-five  children.  In  St.  Vincent's  Orphan  Home,  in  Saginaw, 
the   Sisters  of  Charity  care  for  fully  ninety. 


HILLSDALE    COLLEGE. 

Hillsdale  College  is  situated  in  Hillsdale,  on  the  Lake  Shore  railroad.  It  was 
founded  in  1855,  to  furnish  an  opportunity  for  a  liberal  education  to  all  persons, 
"irrespective  of  nationality,  color  or  sex."  It  has  a  classical,  scientific,  normal, 
theological,  music,  art  and  commercial  department,  with  a  well  selected  library, 
biological  and  chemical  laboratories,  and  a  well  equipped  gymnasium.  Its  liter- 
ary societies  are  among  the  prominent  features  of  the  college.  Since  its  organ- 
ization there  have  been  over  ten  thousand  different  students  in  attendance  in 
its  various  departments,  of  whom  over  six  hundred  have  been  graduated  from  its 
regular  courses.  It  exists  under  the  auspices  of  the  Free  Baptists,  but  it  is  not 
sectarian.  It  has  an  endowment  fund  of  about  $210,000,  and  a  set  of  fine  brick 
buildings  well  adapted  to  college  uses.  Its  president  is  Hon.  George  F.  Mosher 
LL.  D. 


DETROIT    COLLEGE. 

BY   C.    COPPENS,    S.    J.,   VICE   PRESIDENT. 

This  college  was  founded  in  1877,  by  the  fathers  of  the  Society  of  Jesus,  at  the 
invitation  and  with  the  aid  of  the  Rt.  Rev.  Bishop  C.  Borgess,  of  Detroit.  It 
was  incorporated  April  27,  1881,  according  to  the  general  law  of  the  State  of 
Michigan,   with  power  to  grant   the  usual   literary  honors  and   degrees. 


158  Michigan  and   its  Kesources. 

It  embraces  a  classical,  a  scientific  and  a  commercial  course.  Its  president,  the 
Rev.  M.  P.  Dowling,  is  assisted  by  sixteen  professors  and  instructors.  Its  students 
during  the  last  scholastic  year  numbered  310,  those  entered  upon  the  college  reg- 
ister from  the  date  of  its  foundation  to  the  present,  number  1,340.  The  value  of 
its  grounds,  buildings,  library,  apparatus,  etc.,  is  $160,000;  its  liabilities  are  §60,000. 
The  institution  has  never  received  any  aid  from  the  State  or  city,  but  to  erect 
this  beautiful  structure,  built  three  years  ago,  kind  patrons  among  the  Catholics 
of  Detroit  contributed  about  $50,000.  The  tuition  paid  by  each  student  is  put 
down  at  forty  dollars  yearly;  as  a  matter  of  fact  the  income  from  that  source 
was  last  year  $9,520. 

The  college  has  no  other  resources.  But  then  there  are  only  four  instructors 
to  draw  salaries.  The  president  and  all  the  remaining  members  of  the  faculty, 
being  Jesuits,  devote  their  whole  time  and  labor  to  the  welfare  of  the  students 
without  any  other  remuneration  than  their  mere  support,  and  as  they  all  live  in 
the  college  buildings  and  lead  a  community  life,  by  means  of  tuition  fees  and 
occasional  perquistes  they  are  enabled  to  pay  the  current  expenses,  meet  the  inter- 
est on  the  large  debt  and  add  every  year  some  improvements  for  the  benefit  of 
the  students. 

There  are  no  boarders  at  the  college  except  the  faculty.  There  is  no  female 
department.  The  graduates  so  far  count  sixty-eight.  The  library  counts  8,100  vol- 
umes and  about  250  are  added  yearly. 

All  the  members  of  the  faculty  and  nearly  all  the  students  are  Catholics, 
although  others  are  admitted.  The  main  purpose  of  the  school  is  the  thorough 
education  of  its  pupils  in  scholarly  attainments,  strict  moral  and  religious  princi- 
ples and  habits  of  correct   conduct. 


ADRIAN   COLLEGE. 

This  institution  is  delightfully  located  in  the  western  suburbs  of  the  city  of 
Adrian.  The  buildings  are  among  the  best  college  buildings  in  the  State.  They 
are  four  in  number  and  built  of  brick,  heated  with  steam,  are  large,  well  planned 
and  contain  well  furnished,  roomy  dormitories.  The  grounds  include  twenty  acres. 
The  grounds,  buildings,  museum,  libraries,  apparatus,  musical  instruments,  furni- 
ture  and  endowment   are  valued   at  $300,000. 

It  is  controlled  by  a  board. of  thirty  trustees,  twenty-four  of  whom  are  elected 
by  the  Methodist  Protestant  church  and  six  by  the  alumni  association  of  the 
college. 

There  are  four  four-year  courses  and  a  preparatory  department  with  three-year 
courses.  The  degrees  conferred  are  Bachelor  of  Arts,  Bachelor  of  Science,  Bach- 
elor of  Philosophy  and  Bachelor  of  Letters;   also  Masters'  and  Doctors'  degrees. 

There  is  a  school  of  theology  with  complete  course  leading  to  the  degree  of 
Bachelor  of    Divinity. 

There  is  a  school  of  music,  with  instruction  in  instrumental  music,  vocal  music 
and  musical  composition.    Degree,  Bachelor  of  Music. 


Educational.  159 


There  is  a  normal  department  for  the  benefit  of  teachers  in  the  public  schools. 
The  course  of  instruction  extends  through  two  years,  Certificates  of  completion 
are  given.     Instruction   is   also  given   in  painting   and   drawing. 

The   number  of   instructors  is  twelve;   average  number  of  students,   175. 

J.  F.  McCulloch,  B.  Ph.,  A.  M.,  is  president,  and  Geo.  B.  McElroy,  D.  D..  Ph. 
D.,  is  dean  of   the  school  of  the'ology. 


ALBION  COLLEGE. 

Albion  College  was  projected  in  1833  as  a  seminary  or  academy  by  Rev.  Henry 
Colclazer,  Rev.  Elijah  H.  Pilcher,  and  Benjamin  H.  Packard,  M.  D.,  who  were  res- 
idents of  the  territory  of  Michigan.  The  measure  was  endorsed  by  the  Ohio 
conference  of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church  then  having  ecclesiastical  jurisdic- 
tion in  the  State;  and  in  1835  an  act  was  passed  chartering  the  institution 
under  the  name  of  Spring  Arbor  Seminary,  and  locating  the  same  at  Spring  Arbor 
in  Jackson  county.  In  1839  the  charter  was  amended,  the  corporate  name  changed 
to  Wesleyan  Seminary,  and  the  same  removed  to  Albion  in  Calhoun  county. 

The  first  building  was  erected  in  1843,  and  the  Seminary  was  opened  for  recep- 
tion of  students  in  November  of  that  year  under  the  supervision  of  Rev.  Charles 
F.  Stockwell  as  principal.  In  1849  the  powers  of  the  institution  were  enlarged  by 
the  conversion  of  the  seminary  into  a  female  college,  with  authority  to  grant 
degrees  to  women.  In  1861  general  college  powers  were  granted  by  the  legislature 
under  the  corporate  name  of  Albion  College. 

The  institution  occupies  a  campus  of  about  fifteen  acres  just  east  of  the  busi- 
ness portion  of  the  city  of  Albion.  On  these  grounds  there  are  now  standing  six 
buildings — three  of  these  used  for  general  college  purposes,  and  containing,  aside 
from  class  and  lecture  rooms,  the  chapel,  the  library,  museum,  chemical  laboratory, 
biological  laboratory,  conservatory  of  music,  studio  of  the  school  of  painting  and 
society  rooms.  The  fourth  building  in  the  order  of  erection  is  the  astronomical 
observatory,  fully  equipped  and  next  in  size  in  the  State  to  the  observatory  at 
Ann  Arbor.  A  gymnasium,  seventy  by  ninety-three  feet,  was  erected  in  1892.  At 
the  extreme  eastern  point  of  the  campus  stands  the  Sigma  Chi  hall,  built  by  the 
chapter  three  years  ago. 

The  McMillan  chemical  laboratory,  the  gift  of  Hon.  James  McMillan,  senator  in 
congress,  costing  $25,000,  aside  from  plumbing  and  special  fittings,  is  in  process  of 
erection,  the  same  to  be  finished  as  early  as  September  15,  1893. 

Hon  Aaron  T.  Bliss,  of  Saginaw,  ex-member  of  congress,  is  erecting  a  850,000 
library  building,  the  same  to  contain  a   war  memorial  hall.

PENAL  AND  CHARITABLE  INSTITUTIONS. 


BY  L.  C.  STORES,  SECRETARY   STATE   BOARD   OF   CHARITIES   AND   CORRECTIONS. 


PRISONS. 


Michigan  has  three  penal  institutions.  One  at  Jackson,  one  at  Ionia  and  one 
at  Marquette,  in  which  for  the  fiscal  ending  June  30,  1892  there  were  confined 
an  average  1,188  prisoners.  The  city  of  Detroit  has  a  house  of  correction,  in 
which  during  a  like  period  the  average  was  708  prisoners,  a  total  during  1891-2 
of   1,896  prisoners. 

The  prison  property  of  the  State  is  estimated  at  §1,534,416.98,  and  there  was 
expended   in  operating  them  during  1890-2,  $214,037.10. 

The  prisoners  are  provided  with  chapels  and  school  rooms,  and  with  chaplain 
and  teachers. 

An  industrial  home  for  discharged  prisoners  is  in  active  operation,  situated 
in  Detroit.  This  is  not  a  State  institution,  but  was  founded  and  is  now  directed 
by  Mrs.   Agnes    L.   d'Arcambal. 

The  home  is  incorporated  by  the  State,  controlled  by  a  board  of  trustees  and 
supported  largely  by   the   avails  of   the   products   of   its    industries. 


REFORMATORIES. 

Michigan  has  two,  the  Industrial  School  for  Boys  at  Lansing,  and  the  Indus- 
trial Home  for  Girls  at  Adrian.  For  the  fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  1892,  there 
were  confined  in  these  two  institutions  an  average  of  709  children.  The  State 
has  invested  in  them  $428,246.05  and  the  expense  of  operating  them  in  1891-2 
was  $98,500.00.  The  system  of  parol  is  in  operation  and  large  numbers  from 
these  schools  have  found  homes  with  good  families  throughout  the  State  and 
are  doing  well.

DEPENDENT    AND    NEGLECTED    CHILDREN. 

Michigan  maintains  a  school  and  temporary  home  for  such  at  Coldwater 
called  the  State  Public  School.  During  the  eighteen  years  of  its  existence  3,261 
children  have  been  received  into  such  institution.  June  30,  1892,  there  were 
in  the  school  and  out  on  trial  (but  still  belonging)  283  children;  out  under 
indenture  (but  under  the  control  of  the  school),  1,069;  of  the  total  number 
received,  only  402  were  returned  to  the  counties  from  which  received  (unfit 
under  the  law  to  remain);  the  balance  had  been  adopted,  married,  become  self- 
supporting,  etc.  The  State  has  invested  in  this  school  $227,816.22.  The  cur- 
rent expenses  for   1891-2   were  $33,570.75. 


COUNTY    AGENCY    SYSTEM. 

An  agent  is  appointed  in  each  county  in  Michigan  by  the  Governor.  His 
duties  are,  in  a  general  way  to  examine  and  report  on  the  home  of  each  appli- 
cant for  children  from  the  industrial  school,  and  from  the  school  for  dependent 
children.  To  supervise  such  children  after  being  placed  in  homes.  To  examine 
the  case  of  each  and  every  child  under  sixteen  years  of  age  who  has  been  arrested 
and  to  counsel  with,  and  recommend  to  the  court,  what  disposition  shall  be 
made  of  a  child  so  arrested.  These  agents  report  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  June 
30,  1892,  812  children  arrested,  of  whom  230  were  committed  to  reformatories 
and  396  were  placed  in  homes;  596  visits  were  made  to  children  placed  in  homes. 


THE    BLIND,    THE    DEAF    AND    DUMB. 

Michigan  has  an  institution  for  each  of  these  two  classes  of  defections.  There 
was  an  average  attendance  during  1892  at  the  School  for  the  Blind  of  seventy-four 
pupils.  The  State  has  invested  in  these  two  institutions  $715,619,34.  The  opera- 
ting expenses  were  $75,357.89. 


INSANE. 


Three  State  asylums  exist  in  the  State,  besides  an  asylum  for  the  Dangerous  and 
Criminal  Insane.  There  were  under  treatment  at  the  three,  during  the  year  1892, 
2,914  patients.  There  are  the  two  private  asylums  in  Michigan,  in  which  there 
were    191    patients,    and    one    county   asylum    (Wayne),    in    which  there    were    245

patients.    The  State  property  in  her  three  asylums  aggregates  $2,384,3'7'1.08,  and  the 
operating  expenses  for  the  year  1891-2  were  $544,239.03. 

Insane  convicts  in  Michigan  prisons  are  transferred  to  her  Asylum  for  Criminal 
and  Dangerous  Insane,  where  they  are  cared  for  as  all  others  like  afflicted.  To 
this  institution  are  also  tranferred  from  her  other  asylums  all  inmates  of  homicidal 
tendencies. 


THE   INDUSTRIAL  SCHOOL  FOR   BOYS 

is  located  at  Lansing,  Michigan.  It  was  formerly  called  the  Reform  School  and 
was  established  in  1855,  costing  $25,000.  With  the  institution  is  a  farm,  in  all 
261  acres,  and  upon  this  a  large  amount  of  crops  are  produced,  serving  the 
double  purpose  of  furnishing  vegetables,  grain,  hay  and  fruit  for  the  use  of  the 
institution  and  at  the  same  time  employment  and  instruction  to  the  boys.  The 
number  in  school  December,  1892,  was  413.  The  object  of  this  institution  is  to 
reform,  educate  and  make  useful  men  of  a  class  of  boys  from  which  the  criminal 
and  vicious   element   is   recruited. 

Boys  made  bad  by  circumstances  are  arrested  in  their  criminal  course  and  by 
discipline,  instruction  and  good  example  are  directed  into  honorable  channels  and 
many  become  respectable,  useful  and  wealthy  citizens.  The  State  recognizes  the 
fact  that  it  costs  less  and  is  much  better  to  reform  and  check  the  growth  of 
criminals   than  to   manage   them   after   made. 


THE  INDUSTRIAL   HOME  FOR  GIRLS. 

Located  at  Adrian,  in  Lenawee  county,   was  established  in  1879. 

The  object  of  this  institution  is  the  reformation  of  juvenile  females  who  have 
by  force  of  circumstances  got  started  on  a  career  which  would  almost  Certainly 
result   in  crime  and  abandonment. 

The  cost  of  maintaining  this  institution  for  two  years  ending  June  30,  1892, 
was  $72,428.23,  and  the  result  proves  the  wisdom  of  the  expenditure.  Two  hun- 
dred and  seven  girls  were  provided  for,  taken  from  their  demoralizing  surround- 
ings ahd  halted  in  their  short,  rapid  race  to  infamy.  Too  little  genuine  sympa- 
thy is  manifested  for  this  class.  Many  poor,  unfortunate  girls  are  driven  forward 
in  their  downward  course  by  unkind  and  unchristian  treatment  from  those  who 
utter  long  prayers  in  churches,  who  might  reform  and  ought  to  be  aided  and 
encouraged. 

The  institution   deserves   credit   and  support.

ASYLUMS  FOR  THE  INSANE. 

The  State  is  provided  with  four  institutions  and  an  act  passed  the  legislature 
in  1893  establishing  the  fifth  in  the  upper  peninsula.  Michigan  asylum  for  the 
insane,  the  oldest,  is  located  at  Kalamazoo  and  was  established  by  an  act  passed 
in  1848.    It  cost  $572,000,  and  was  opened  in  1859. 

The  disbursements  for  two  years  ending  January  3,  was  $422,470,  a  consider- 
able portion  of  which  was  paid  by  individuals   and   counties. 

The  number  of  patients,  males,  520;  females,  527;  medical  attendants,  6; 
employes,   198. 

Eastern  Michigan  Asylum  is  located  at  Pontiac,  Oakland  county.  It  was  opened 
in  1878  and  cost  $467,000. 

Number  of  patients  under  treatment  in  1892  was,  males,  449;  females,  444; 
medical  attendants,  5;  employes,   163. 

Northern  Michigan  Asylum,  established  in  1881,  is  located  at  Traverse  City, 
Grand   Traverse  county,   and  cost   $522,4.30. 

Michigan  Asylumn  for  Dangerous  and  Criminal  Insane  was  established  in  1883, 
and  is  located  at  Ionia,  in  connection  with  the  reformatory.  It  cost  $91,750. 
Number  of   patients  in   1892,   164;   number    of   employes,  31. 

The  legislature  of  1893  made  appropriations  for  an  asylum  for  the  insane  in  the  upper 
peninsula.  Each  institution  of  this  kind  is  managed  by  a  special  board  of  trustees 
appointed  by  the  Governor,  and  is  managed  in  the  best  possible  manner.

STATE  INDEBTEDNESS  AND  TAXATION. 


BY   E.   J.   WEIGHT,   TAX   DEPAETMENT,   AUDITOE   GENEEAL  S   OFFICE. 


Michigan  is  practically  free  from  debt,  the  entire  amount  of  outstanding  State 
bonds  being  $10,992.83,  on  which  interest  ceased  long  since.  By  the  conditions  of 
the  grant  of  certain  lands  to  the  State  by  the  United  States  the  proceeds  of  the 
sale  of  the  lands  so  granted  are  held  by  the  State  as  a  perpetual  trust  for  the 
benefit  of  its  grand  system  of  public  schools,  the  State  assuming  the  obligation  to 
pay  the  interest  thereon  annually  for  the  support  of  the  schools.  The  moneys  to 
the  credit  of  the  several  funds  at  the  commencement  of  the  present  fiscal  year 
were:  Primary  school  fund,  $4,466,090.06;  University  fund,  $522,211.93;  Agricultural 
College  fund,  $401,414.63;  Normal  School  fund,  $64,622.62.  The  equalized  valuation  of 
the  State  ten  years  ago  was  $810,000,000;  the  last  equalization  made  it  $1,130,000,000. 
An  average  tax  of  but  a  small  fraction  over  one  and  one-half  mills  per  annum  has 
sufficed  to  amply  sustain  the  State  government,  the  asylums,  reformatory  and  penal 
institutions,  to  pay  the  State's  obligations  to  its  educational  institutions,  and  to 
liberally  provide  for  every  demand  upon  the  State's  resources. 

The  census  of  1890  gives  the  combined  State,  county,  municipal,  and  school  dis- 
trict indebtedness  of  the  State  as  $8.09  per  capita,  divided  as  follows:  State,  com- 
bining the  trust  funds  as  a  debt  of  the  State  and  including  $31,992.83  of  the  State 
bonds  then  outstanding,  $5,308,294;  county,  $1,257,698;  municipal,  $8,510,439;  school 
district,  $1,865,497.  The  nominal  debt  was  $2.54  per  capita,  or  in  reality  the  entire 
liability  of  each  citizen  to  the  State,  in  addition  to  his  share  of  the  current  require- 
ments, being  to  pay  annually  7  per  cent  on  $2.54. 

Local  taxation  is  proportionately  light,  the  economy  of  government  being  such 
that  the  requirements  of  the  counties,  townships  and  school  districts,  are  far  from 
burdensome.  Even  in  the  cities  and  villages  where  municipal  luxuries  are  some- 
times liberally  indulged  in,  taxation  is  rarely  excessive. 

Railroad  and  express  companies,  insurance  companies  (exclusive  of  mutual  benefit 
associations  and  farmers'  mutual  fire  insurance  companies),  and  some  other  corpora- 
tions, pay  tribute  to  the  State  by  specific  taxes,  licenses  and  incorporation  fees,  etc. 


State  Indebtedness  and  Taxation.  167 

The  tax  on  liquor  dealers  is  a  considerable  amount.  While  these  taxes  are  by  no 
means  restrictive,  they  materially  reduce  the  amount  required  to  be  raised  by  gen- 
eral taxation.  The  last  legislature  enacted  a  law  providing  for  a  graduated  tax 
upon  inheritances  the  effect  of  which  cannot  be  determined  yet. 

All  property  real  and  personal,  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  State,  is  subject  to 
taxation,  unless  expressly  exempted  by  law,  and  assessors  are  required  to  assess  all 
property  at  its  cash  value.  Real  property  belonging  to  the  United  States,  to  the 
State,  or  to  counties,  townships,  cities,  villages,  or  school  districts,  and  used  for 
public  purposes,  is  exempted.  Real  and  personal  property  owned  and  occupied  by 
library,  benevolent,  charitable,  educational  and  scientific  institutions,  incorporated 
under  the  laws  of  the  State,  is  exempted  while  occupied  solely  for  the  purposes 
for  which  such  institutions  were  incorporated.  Houses  of  public  worship,  with  the 
land  on  which  they  stand,  the  furniture  therein,  and  all  right  in  the  pews,  and 
parsonages  owned  by  religious  societies,  and  occupied  as  such;  all  lands  used  as 
burial  grounds,  and  the  tombs  and  monuments  therein;  the  real  properly  of  corpo- 
rations paying  specific  taxes  (except  that  railroad  properties  are  liable  to  assess- 
ment for  local  improvements  in  cities  and  villages,  and  all  railroad  lands  not 
adjoining  the  tracks  of  the  company,  are  subject  to  all  taxes);  property  owned 
exclusively  by  State,  county,  or  district  agricultural  societies,  and  used  exclusively 
for  fair  purposes;  the  real  and  personal  property  of  persons  who  in  the  opinion  of 
the  supervisor  and  board  of  review,  by  reason  of  poverty  are  unable  to  contribute 
toward  the  public  charges;  lands  dedicated  to  the  public  and  used  us  public  parks. 
and  monument  grounds  or  armories  belonging  to  military  organizations,  and  not 
used  for  gain,  complete  the  list  of  exemptions  of  real  property.  The  other  exemp- 
tions of  personal  property  are:  So  much  of  the  credits  due,  or  to  become  due,  as 
shall  equal  the  amount  of  bona  fide  and  unconditional  debts  of  the  person  owning 
household  furniture,  provisions  and  fuel,  to  the  value  of  five  hundred  dollars  to 
each  household,  the  library,  family  pictures,  school  books,  one  sewing  machine, 
used  and  owned  by  each  individual  or  family,  and  the  wearing  apparel  of  every 
individual,  farm  implements  and  machinery  or  personal  property  of  any  farmer 
to  the  amount  of  8200,  the  working  tools  of  any  mechanic  not  to  exceed  in  value 
8100;  all  mules,  and  horses  and  cattle,  not  over  one  year  old,  all  sheep  and  swine 
not  over  six  months  old,  and  all  domesticated  birds;  pensions  receivable  from  the 
United  States,  the  personal  property  of  library  associations,  circulating  libraries, 
libraries  of  reference,  and  reading  rooms  owned  or  supported  by  the  public  and 
not  used  for  gain,  and  all  posts  of  the  G.  A.  R.,  tents  of  the  S.  O.  V.,  of  the  W.  R.  C, 
the  Y.  M.  C.  A.,  the  W.  C.  T.  U.,  Y.  P.  C.  U.,  and  similar  associations;  the  property  of 
Indians  not  citizens,  and  all  fire  engines  or  other  implements  for  extinguishing 
fires,  when  owned  or  used  by  any  organized  or  independent  fire  company.  Personal 
property  is  assessed  where  found  in  April,  and  the  assessment  roll  is  made  by  the 
supervisor  or  assessor  in  May.  All  persons  may  be  required  to  furnish  sworn  state- 
ments of  their  property.  The  assessment  is  open  to  inspection,  and  is  subject  to  revision 
and  correction  by  the  board  of  review  as  may  appear  equitable  and  proper.  At  their 
annual  session  the  board  of  supervisors  of  each  county  equalizes  the  value  of  real 
property  in  the  several  assessment  districts  and  determines  the  amount  to  be  raised 
by  taxes  for  current  purposes.  Taxes  assessed  become  a  debt  to  the  township 
and  a  lien  upon  the  property  assessed  on  December  1,  and  the  township  treasurer 
or   village   collector   is   required   to   collect  and  pay  over   the  taxes  before  March  1 


168  Michigan  and  its  Eesoueces. 

following.  A  collection  fee  of  four  per  cent  is  added  to  taxes  unpaid  after  December 
and  interest  at  eight  per  cent  after  March  1.  No  personal  property  is  exempt 
from  seizure  and  sale  to  satisfy  unpaid  taxes.  Unpaid  taxes  on  real  property 
are  returned  to  the  county  treasurer  and  by  him  to  the  Auditor  General,  and  if 
not  paid  to  the  Auditor  General  or  the  county  treasurer  within  one  year  after 
return  the  lands  are  subject  to  sale  for  taxes  and  charges,  including  seventy  cents 
for  the  expense  of  advertising  and  sale  of  each  description.  The  Auditor  General 
files  with  the  circuit  court  of  each  county  a  petition  for  decree,  and  the  delinquent 
taxpayer  is  notified  of  his  day  in  court  by  publication.  A  decree  having  been 
obtained,  sale  is  made  on  the  first  Monday  in  December  at  the  county  treasurer's 
office.  After  sale  one  year  is  allowed  for  redemption,  after  which  a  deed  is  issued  to 
the  purchaser  on  demand,  unless  bid  in  to  the  State,  in  which  event  the  land  is 
subject  to  sale  by  the  Auditor  General  as  State  tax  land,  a  deed  being  issued  to 
the  purchaser.  All  State  tax  lands  unsold  are  offered  at  the  annual  sales  of 
delinquent  tax  lands. 

Lands  subject  to  sale  for  taxes  are  sold  for  the  taxes,  charges,  and  accrued  interest, 
and  the  purchaser  may  be  put  in  possession  by  writ  of  assistance  issued  out  of 
the  circuit   court. 

All  conveyances  of  land,  except  those  executed  by  law,  must  be  accompanied 
by  certificates  from  the  Auditor  General  or  county  treasurer,  showing  that  the 
taxes  thereon  have  been  paid  for  the  five  years  preceding  the  date  of  the  instru- 
ment when  presented  to  the  register  of  deeds  for  recording.  The  experience  of 
the  State  in  the  State  system  for  the  collection  of  delinquent  taxes  on  lands,  in 
contradistinction  from  the  county  system,  is  that  a  larger  proportion  of  taxes 
are  collected  by  the  State  system,  and  at  a  much  less  expense  than  in  the  states 
which  adhere  to  the  county  system,  which  has  been  twice  tried  by  Michigan 
and  as  often  abandoned  because  of  its  proven  undesirability,  uncertainty  and  lack 
of  uniformity. 


MICHIGAN:   ITS    RESOURCES,  BANKING   LAW,  AND 

FINANCES. 


BY   HON.    T.    C.    SHEKWOOD,   BANK   COMMISSIONER,    MICHIGAN. 


Note.— On  account  of  the  failure  of  some  Michigan  banks,  a  feeling  of  distrust  was  created  against  the 
entire  system  in  the  minds  of  many  citizens,  which  caused  a  great  deal  of  needless  anxiety  and  suspicion. 
For  the  benefit  of  persons  not  understanding  the  banking  laws  and  iinancial  resources  of  the  State,  we 
copy  the  following  article  by  permission: 

Michigan,  the  beautiful  Peninsular  State,  to  be  known  needs  but  to  be  mentioned. 
With  its  two  and  one-half  millious  of  inhabitants  and  its  58,915  square  miles  of 
territory,  it  comprises  not  only  a  wide  region  of  abundant  natural  resources  but 
also  those  industries  and  improvements  that  make  her  the  peer  of  any  State  in  the 
Union.  The  coal  fields  and  beautiful  farms  of  the  southern  part  of  the  lower  penin- 
sula, the  forests  of  the  northern  portion,  together  with  the  copper,  iron  and 
forestry  of  the  upper  peninsula,  combine  to  make  Michigan  rich  in  natural 
resources  to  which  when  added  the  manufacturing  industry,  which  the  enterprise, 
thrift  and  industry  of  the  citizens  has  built  up,  together  with  her  excellent  system 
of  free  schools,  all  tend  to  give  Michigan  a  world-wide  reputation  in  all  that  adds 
to  the  material,  industrial  and  intellectual  wealth  of  the  nation. 

Time  will  not  permit  me  to  fully  discuss  the  resources  of  Michigan,  and  I  will 
therefore  call  your  attention  to  but  a  few  industries,  the  development  of  which 
has  made  Michigan  famous  the  world  over.  I  will  only  refer  to  the  copper,  iron 
ore,  lumber,  shingles,  salt  and  furniture  industries,  at  this  time,  and  hope  you  will 
become  sufficiently  interested  to  visit  us  and  make  a  personal  tour  of   inspection. 

For  the  year  1892  the  output  of  copper  in  Michigan,  as  compiled  by  the  Mining 
Journal,  was  107,200,000  pounds  of  refined  copper,  which  at  twelve  cents  per  pound, 
the  average  price  during  the  year,  amounts  to  $12,864,000.00,  and  yet  we  are  not 
asking  that  copper  be  coined  into  pennies  and  made  a  legal  tender  for  debts. 

The  output  of  iron  ore  in  1892,  according  to  the  Iron  Herald,  amounted  to  7,824,- 
556  tons,  the  average  price  being  $4.00  per  ton,  making  the  total  value  $31,298,624.00.

The  total  quantity  of  lumber  manufactured  in  Michigan  in  1892  was  3,794,256,754: 
feet  which  at  $15.00  per  thousand  amounts  to  $56,913,851  00. 

The  total  number  of  shingles  make  in  1892  was  2,140.647,875,  the  average  price 
as  to  grades  being  $2.50  per  thousand,  makes  the  total  value  $5,351,620.00. 

The  number  of  barrels  of  salt  produced  in  Michigan  in  1892  was  3,812,000, 
which  at  sixty  cents  per  barrel  amounts  to  $2,287,000;  and  last  though  not  least 
comes  the  furniture  industry,  which  in  Michigan  in  increasing  each  year.  The 
city  of  Grand  Rapids,  which  today  is  perhaps  the  most  noted  furniture  manufact- 
uring city  in  the  United  States,  in  1892  manufactured  furniture  valued  at 
$10,864,000. 

From  these  six  industries  alone  (one  of  which  is  incomplete,  as  I  have  only 
given  the  furniture  product  of  one  city)  Michigan  offers  to  the  markets  of  the 
world,  in  one  year,  goods  amounting  to  over  $119,500,000. 

I  have  not  mentioned  the  great  agricultural  interest  of  Michigan,  not  because  it 
is  insignificant,  for  it  is  not.  It  far  exceeds  every  other  industry,  and  compares 
favorably  with  any  other  of  our  sister  states  in  its  production  of  hay,  grain,  wool, 
fruit  and  vegetables. 

I  have  simply  mentioned  those  industries  that  have  made  Michigan  known 
abroad  and  gained  for  her  an  enviable  reputation  among  the  sisterhood  of  states. 

Notwithstanding  Michigan  is  rich  in  agricultural,  timber  and  mineral  resources, 
until  a  few  years  we  have  had  to  depend  upon  outside  capital  for  the  development 
of  these  resources,  and  this  brings  me  to  the  second  part  of  the  subject  assigned 
me,  viz.: 

ITS   BANKING   LAW   AND    FINANCES. 

Michigan  in  common  with  other  states  has  had  a  varied  experience  in  banking 
and  banking  laws,  and  has  dearly  paid  for  that  experience  in  the  losses  she  has 
sustained,  as  have  other  states  in  the  union,  as  well   as  the  nations  of  Europe. 

It  seems  stranere  that  the  states  and  nations  will  not  be  benefited  by  the  experi- 
ence of  others,  but  thev  will  not.  The  John  laws  of  today  are  just  as  positive 
that  something  can  be  made  out  of  nothing  as  was  the  original  John  in  France  in 
1718.  Each  individual  thinks  his  financial  policy  the  correct  one,  and  the  reason  it 
failed  of  success  173  years  ago  was  because  the  system  was  in  advance  of  the 
times,  which  the  changes  in  the  manner  of  transacting  business  and  the  increased 
intelligence  of  the  people  will  now  make  successful.  We  admit  that  the  business 
methods  have  chaneed  within  the  cast  few  years,  and  will  necessarily  change  as 
business  increases  and  our  facilities  for  exchanging  the  products  of  the  different 
countries  multiply.  We  also  realize  that  there  is  a  marked  advancement  in  the 
intelligence  of  our  business  men.  but  we  must  not  forget  that  the  great  funda- 
mental principles  of  finance  never  change  and  the  more  intelligence  we  possess  the 
more  careful  we  will  be  to  have  a  sound  foundation  for  the  support  of  the  finan- 
cial system  which  is  the  life  blood  of  the  nation. 

The  Michigan  banking  law  of  1837,  under  which  the  notorious  "wildcat"  money 
was  issued,  was  repealed  in  1841,  but  it  was  not  until  1857  that  the  State  had  a 
banking  law  that  was  at  all  satisfactory  to  the  public;  this  law  provided  for  banks 
of  issue,  in  fact  up  to  the  close  of  the  civil  war  the  name  bank  carried  with  it 
the  idea  of  an  issue  of  paper  currency  rather  than  for  the  transacting  of  the  bus- 


Banking  Law  and  Finances.  '        171 

iness  of  the  commercial  world,  and  for  the  safe  deposit  of  the  surplus  funds  of  our 
citizens.  The  passage  by  congress  of  the  national  banking  act  in  1863  and  the 
law  passed  in  1865  imposing  a  tax  of  ten  per  cent  on  the  amount  of  the  notes 
of  any  State  bank  or  banking  association,  effected  a  complete  change  in  the 
system  of   banking   in  our   State. 

Instead  of  being  banks  of  issue  and  depending  largely  upon  circulation  for  their 
profits,  our  banks  became  commercial  associations  or,  if  you  please,  clearing  houses, 
where  our  business  men  made  their  exchanges,  discounted  their  commercial  paper 
and  deposited  their  surplus  money;  the  banks'  profits  being  derived  from  loans 
made  with  these  deposits  (upon  which  no  interest  was  paid)  and  from  exchange 
bought  and  sold. 

The  law  of  1857,  although  reasonably  satisfactory  in  the  transaction  of  commer- 
cial business,  even  in  the  changed  condition  of  business  affairs,  failed  to  provide 
for  small  depositors  who  desired  to  deposit  their  savings  and  receive  interest 
thereon.  Hence,  in  1873,  the  law  was  amended  providing  for  the  incorporation  of 
savings  banks.  But  the  State  has  outgrown  the  law.  It  was  incomplete  and 
defective   and  many  of  its  provisions   obsolete. 

The  business  men  of  the  State  urged  upon  the  legislature  of  1887  the  necessity 
of  a  new  banking  law  that  would  satisfy  the  demands  of  the  constantly  increasing 
business  of  the  State. 

The  legislature  enacted  such  a  law,  which  was  adopted  by  the  people  at  the 
general   election  of   1888,   and   became  operative  January  7,  1889. 

Michigan's  present  general  banking  law  provides  for  a  banking  department 
charged  with  the  execution  of  the  law,  and  its  chief  oflBcer  is  called  the  Commis- 
sioner of   the  Banking  Department. 

He  issues  authority  for  the  incorporation  of  banks,  calls  for  at  least  four  reports 
annually,  at  such  times  as  he  deems  necessary,  causes  examinations  to  be  made  of 
each  bank  under  his  supervision,  at  least  once  in  each  year,  and  hae  the  same 
authority  over  the  State  banks  of  Michigan  that  the  Comptroller  of  the  Currency 
at  Washington   has  over  the   national   banks  of   the   United  States. 

In  fact  our  banking  law  is  copied  largely  from  the  national  bank  act,  with 
several  additional  amendments,  applicable  to  the  business  necessities  of  our 
State. 

Michigan  State  banks  are  capitalized  and  the  stockholders  are  each  liable  for 
an  amount  equal  to  the  par  value  of  their  stock  in  addition  to  the  said  stock.  At 
least  fifty  per  cent  of  the  capital  must  be  paid  in  before  the  bank  is  authorized 
to  commence  business,  and  the  remainder  in  monthly  installments  of  at  least  ten 
per  cent  of  the  capital  stock. 

The  amount  of  capital  required  of  a  State  bank  is  regulated  by  the  size  of  the 
city  or  town  where  the  bank  is  located,  the  smallest  capital  being  $15,000  in  towns 
whose  population  does  not  exceed  1,500. 

Michigan's  banking  law  differs  from  the  national  bank  act  in  that  it  is  a  dual 
law.  It  recognizes  two  classes  of  business— commercial  and  savings— both  separate 
and  distinct,  and  yet  both  embodied  in  one  with  separate  restrictions. 

The  commercial  department  of  our  State  banks  is  especially  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  business  men.  They  are  exclusively  devoted  to  the  collection,  safe  keeping 
and  the  employment  in  temporary  loans  the  floating  capital  of  the  country. 

Every  merchant,  miner,   manufacturer  and  farmer  is  dependent  upon  the   com- 


172  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

mercial  bank  for  funds  to  enable  them  to  market  their  products  at  the  earliest 
moment.  Hence,  Michigan's  law  restricts  the  loaning  of  the  deposits  of  commer- 
cial banks  upon  mortgage  or  any  form  of  real  estate  security  to  fifty  per  cent  of 
its  capital  stock,  and  then  only  upon  a  two-thirds  vote  of  its  directors,  except  to 
secure  a  debt  previously  contracted  in  good  faith. 

This  restriction  is  simply  to  prevent  the  tying  up  of  capital  by  long  time  loans, 
and  by  so  doing  embarrass  the  commercial  and  manufacturing  enterprises  of  the 
State. 

The  savings  department  of  our  State  banks  is  the  depository  for  the  surplus 
money  not  needed   in   active  commercial   business. 

Deposits  in  this  department  are  generally  made  by  mechanics,  who  have  not 
the  time  or  opportunity  to  make  investments,  and  by  laborers  and  servants,  who 
have  not  the  education  or  ability  to  engage  in  active  business. 

They  deposit  their  money  for  safe  keeping  and  for  interest  under  such  rules  and 
regulations  as   the  board  of   directors  of  the  bank  prescribes. 

One  of  the  rules  governing  savings  deposits  adopted  by  nearly  every  savings 
bank  in  the  State,  provides  that  the  cashier  may  in  all  cases  require  ninety  days' 
notice  to  him  in  writing,  before  a  depositor  will  be  entitled  to  withdraw  his 
deposit  or   any  part  thereof. 

This  rule  is  enforced  only  in  case  of  financial  excitement  and  has  been  resorted 
to  with  good  effect  by  many  banks  in  our  State  during  the  past  few  weeks. 

People  withdraw  their  money  from  banks  in  times  of  financial  excitement  not 
because  they  doubt  the  solvency  of  the  bank,  so  much  as  they  fear  that  others 
will  get  ahead  of  them  and  secure  the  money  the  bank  has  on  hand.  When  they 
find  that  none  are  allowed  to  draw  their  deposits  they  go  away  satisfied  that  their 
chances  are  as  good  as  others,  and  usually  at  the  end  of  sixty  days  thank  the 
cashier  for  enforcing  the  ninety  day  rule. 

Michigan's  banking  law  recognizes  the  fact. that  banks  are  but  the  custodians  of 
the  people's  money  and  therefore  prescribe  the  amount,  quality  and  kind  of  secur- 
ities that  may  be  taken  with  the  deposits  in  the  two  departments  of  our  State 
banks. 

In  the  commercial  department,  as  I  have  already  said,  money  can  not  be  loaned 
on  real  estate  security  except  by  a  two-thirds  vote  of  its  directors  and  then  not 
more  than  fifty  per  cent  of  its  capital. 

It  can  not  loan  to  one  individual,  company,  corporation  or  firm  more  than  ten 
per  cent  of  its  capital  and  surplus,  except  by  a  two-thirds  vote  of  its  directors,  in 
which  case  the  limit  is  twenty  per  cent. 

This  limitation  does  not  apply  to  loans  upon  real  estate  or  other  collateral  secur- 
ity, or  the  discounting  of  commercial  paper  owned  by  the  person  negotiating  the 
same,  or  bills  of  exchange  drawn  in  good  faith  against  actually  existing  values. 

Commercial  banks  or  banks  with  commercial  departments  are  required  to  keep 
on  hand  at  all  times  at  least  fifteen  per  cent  of  their  total  deposits,  except  that  in 
cities  of  over  one  hundred  thousand  population,  each  of  such  banks  shall  keep  on 
hand  twenty  per  cent  of  its  deposits,  one-half  of  which  reserve  shall  be  in  lawful 
money,  and  the  balance  may  be  in  funds,  payable  on  demand,  deposited  in  banks 
in  cities,  approved  by  the  Commissioner  as  reserve  cities. 

The  savings  department  is  required  to  keep  on  hand  at  least  fifteen  per  cent  of 
its  deposits,  one-third  of  which  reserve  shall  be  in  lawful  money  in  its  own  vaults, 


Banking    Law  and  Finances.  173 

and  the  balance  on  deposit  payable  on  demand  with  banks,  national  or  State,  in 
reserve  cities  or  invested  in  United  States  bonds. 

Three-fifths  of  the  remainder,  or  fifty-one  per  cent  of  the  deposits,  must  be 
invested  in  bonds  or  in  negotiable  paper  secured  by  bonds,  or  upon  notes  or  bonds 
secured  by  mortgage  lien  upon  unincumbered  real  estate,  worth  at  least  twice  the 
amount  loaned. 

The  remainder  of  the  deposits,  or  thirty-four  per  cent,  may  be  invested  in  notes, 
bills  or  other  evidences  of  debt,  the  payment  of  which  is  secured  by  the  deposit 
of  personal  property  as  security,  or  may  be  deposited  in  banks  in  reserve  cities, 
providing  the  amount  does  not  exceed  ten  per  cent  of  the  total  deposits,  capital 
and  surplus  of  the  depositing  bank,  and  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  capital  and 
additional  stockholders'  liability  may  be  invested  in  negotiable  paper  approved 
by  the  board  of  directors. 

This  34  per  cent  investment  of  collateral  and  short  time  commercial  paper, 
acts  as  a  sort  of  financial  safety  valve.  Being  readily  converted  in  money,  it 
enables  a  bank  to  meet  unusual  demands  without  being  compelled  to  dispose 
of  its  mortgage   securities. 

At  the  time  our  banking  law  was  being  discussed  in  the  legislature,  I  had 
some  doubt  of  the  wisdom  of  allowing  banks  to  incorporate  with  savings  and 
commercial  departments  for  the  transaction  of  both  classes  of  business,  but 
after  four  years  of  trial,  I  see  no  reason  for  changing,  especially  in  small  towns 
and  villages  where  the  two  classes  of  business  could  not  profitably  be  carried 
on   in   two   separate   institutions. 

Many  business  men  now  have  two  bank  accounts,  one  commercial  and  one 
savings.  The  bank  combining  both  classes  of  business  can  accommodate  this  class 
of  persons,  and  there  is  no  excuse  for  a  bank's  customer  going  elsewhere  for 
an  accommodation,   unless  at   the    request   of   the  bank. 

The  relations  between  a  bank  and  its  customer  should  be  as  close  and  private 
as  between  physician  and  patient.  No  man  in  ill  health  would  think  of  con- 
sulting and  taking  prescriptions  from  three  or  four  physicians  at  the  same  time 
unless  he  expected  to  die,  and  no  man  should  have  accounts  at  several  banks, 
especially  if  he  is  a  borrower,  unless  he  expects  to  die  a  financial  death  and 
wants  a  large  number  of  mourners  at  his  funeral.  It  is  a  fact  that  no  banker 
can  deny,  that  the  heaviest  losses  banks  sustain  are  by  those  who  are  custom- 
ers of  several  banks  at  the   same  time. 

Michigan's  law  does  not  permit  the  issuing  of  any  bill,  note  or  certificate 
intended  to   circulate   as   money,   neither   can   a  bank   issue  post  notes. 

All  debts  due  to  any  State  banking  association  on  which  interest  is  past  due 
and  unpaid  for  a  period  of  six  months,  unless  the  same  are  well  secured  or  in 
process  of  collection,  are  required  to  be  charged  off  at  the  expiration  of  that 
time. 

The  expenses  of  the  banking  department  are  paid  by  the  State  from  the 
general  fund,  but  each  State  bank  is  required  to  pay  into  the  State  treasury 
for  the  credit  of  the  general  fund,  one-hundredth  part  of  one  per  cent  of  the 
gross  amount  of  the  assets  of  said  bank  at  the  time  the  examination  is  made, 
provided  that  the  examination  fee  of  any  bank  shall  not  be  less  than  ten 
dollars. 

Michigan's    banking    law  does  not   provide  for  the  supervision  of  private  banks. 


174  Michigan  and  its  Eesoueces. 

These  banks  are  without  any  supervision  whatever,  and  so  far  as  the  public 
knows,  the  amount  of  capital  invested,  methods  of  business  and  investments 
made,  they  are   what  their   name  indicates,  private. 

Our  law  provides  the  usual  penalties  for  its  violation,  giving  the  commissioner 
power  to  take  immediate  possession  of  a  bank  for  any  violation  of  its  provis- 
ions,  and  under  the   direction   of   the  court   wind   up   its  buisness. 

This  in  brief  is  Michigan's  banking  law,  and  in  the  four  and  one-half  years 
it  has  been  in  operation,  its  adaptability  to  the  varied  business  demands  of  our 
State,  is  amply  proven  by  the  fact  that  over  eighty  banks  have  incorporated 
under  its  provisions  within   that    time. 

On  May  4  last,  the  one  hundred  and  forty-nine  bank  and  three  trust  com- 
panies then  incorporated,  reported  their  assets  as  $84,276,584.34  at  the  same  time 
the  one  hundred  and  three  national  banks  reported  total  assets  as  $75,722,442.09 
making  the  total   assets  of  the  incorporated  banks    of    the    State    $160,000,000.00' 

The  deposits  of  the  State  banks  May  4  were  $65,533,057.93  and  the  national 
banks  $41,056,961.88  make  a  total  of  more  than  $106,590,000.00. 

Rather  than  weary  you  I  have  briefly  alluded  to  the  resources  of  Michigan, 
and  pointed  out  the  salient  points  of  its  banking  law  and  bank  resources,  and 
can  only  add  that  if  you  desire  a  closer  acquaintance  with  us  Wolverines,  visit 
our  State  and  study  for  yourselves  our  marvelous  resources,  our  wonderful 
lakes  and  rivers,  our  health  restoring  summer  resorts,  and  our  beautiful  scenery. 
I  can  assure  you   a  hearty  reception  and  a  royal   welcome. 


FISHERIES. 


HEBSCHEL   V.   WHITTAKER,    OF   STATE   FISH   COMMISSION,   DETROIT. 


"Mich-sawg-ye-gan,"  the  "Land  of  the  Lakes"  was  the  somewhat  poetic  and 
significant  name  given  by  the  Ojibways  to  that  territory  lying  within  the  pre- 
sent borders   of   the   State  of  Michigan. 

From  the  earliest  that  is  known  of  this  territory  it  was  the  favorite  hunting 
and  fishing  ground  of  the  savages.  Here  nature  seems  to  have  provided  every 
variety  of  landscape  from  the  heavily  timbered  mountainous  districts  of  the 
extreme  north  to  those  lovely  natural  parks  called  oak  openings  of  the  south- 
ern peninsula,  carpeted  with  flowers  and  verdant  grasses  and  dotted  everywhere 
with  magnificent  oaks.  Here  and  there,  in  natural  basins  between  the  gentle 
swells  of  the  rolling  prairies  nestled  beautiful  sparkling  lakes,  and  on  their 
limpid  bosoms  were  reflected  the  beauties  of  their  surroundings,  which  seemed 
fittingly  placed  as  mirrors  in  which  nature  might  admire  her  own  loveliness. 
Floating  lazily  over  them  were  innumerable  wild  fowl,  while  their  depths 
swarmed  with  the  king  of  fresh  water  game  fish,  the  black  bass,  the  muskal- 
longe,  the   pike,   and  scores  of  other  kinds  of  edible   fish. 

The  silver  threaded  brooks  and  streams  filled  each  valley  with  their  murmur- 
ings,  and  the  Indian  gliding  from  lake  to  lake  and  stream  to  stream  in  his 
bark    canoe,  had    but    to  stretch    forth  his  hand  and  partake  of  their  bounties. 

More  than  five  thousand  of  these  beautiful  lakes  bountifully  stocked  with  excel- 
lent fish,  lie  within  the  present  limits  of  the  State,  and  while  the  aborigine,  the 
original  proprietor  of  it  all,  has  long  since  departed  for  his  "  Happy  Hunting 
Ground."  the  finny  denizens  of  these  waters  still  delight  the  angler  and  fill  his 
days  with  pleasure. 

Bordering  the  two  peninsulas  of  the  State  and  almost  surrounding  them,  lie  the 
great  fresh  water  seas  of  the  northwest,  the  largest  body  of  fresh  water  on  the 
globe.  Michigan  with  two  thousand  miles  of  lake  coast  holds  preeminence  over 
all  her  sister  states  in  the  importance  of  her  commercial  fisheries.  These  lakes 
have  an  area  or  97,000  square  miles  and  a  total  length  of  about  1,500  miles  with  a 
varying  depth  of  from  100  to  more  than  900  feet,  and  all  of  them  are  filled  with 
the  purest  water. 


176  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

Upon  these  waters  the  missionary,  filled  with  religious  zeal  for  the  salvation  of 
gouls,  launched  his  frail  birch  bark  canoe.  Confiding  his  body  to  the  mercies  of 
the  savages,  and  commending  his  soul  to  his  Maker,  he  set  forth  for  the  conver- 
sion of  the  savages.  Following  him  came  the  hardy  adventurer  and  explorer,  who 
through  lack  of  opportunity  for  military  distinction  in  the  armies  of  France  in 
time  of  peace,  sought  in  the  wilds  of  America  to  extend  the  domain  of  his  king 
and  to  mend  his  own  personal  fortunes,  and  hoped  to  discover  a  way  to  Far  Cathay. 
The  fur  trader  and  the  courrier-du-bois  followed  close  upon  his  footsteps  and  pene- 
trated every  cove  and  inlet  of  the  lakes,  to  barter  their  cheap  and  tawdry  gewgaws 
with  the  redskin  for  the  valuable  peltries  of  the  beaver,  i*ink,  otter  and  other  fur 
bearing  animals. 

All  these  found  these  lakes  teeming  with  the  choicest  varieties  of  fish.  Here  was 
the  "  attikumaig,"  the  ''  deer-of-the-water,"  that  most  excellent  of  fishes,  the  white- 
fish,  the  "  salmo  namaycush "  or  salmon  trout  whose  proportions  are  said  to  have 
reached  the  weight  of  seventy  pounds,  the  pike,  perch  or  pickerel,  the  dor^  of  the 
French,  the  lordly  sturgeon  which  exceeded  in  size  all  others,  often  reaching  a 
weight  of  one  hundred  and  twenty-five  pounds;  the  siskowet,  the  muskallonge, 
the  white  and  black  bass,  the  rock  bass,  pike,  catfish,  mullet,  perch,  sun  fish,  gar 
and  other  varieties  abounded  everywhere,  and  in  their  season  the  multitudes  of 
herring  or  ciscoes  exceeded  belief. 

For  years  after  the  white  man  settled  on  these  lakes  these  storehouses  of  food 
remained  untouched  save  for  the  small  demand  made  upon  them  by  the  scattered 
settlers  for  daily  food,  and  for  the  small  quantities  which  were  salted  for  winter 
use. 

In  the  decade  between  1830  and  1840  fishing  as  an  industry  first  began  to  assume 
some  importance  and  a  few  persons  engaged  in  it  as  a  business,  but  the  product 
was  largely  salted  and  put  up  in  packages  for  shipment. 

About  1850  the  fishermen  on  the  Detroit  river  constructed  in  connection  with 
their  fisheries  where  the  whitefish  was  taken  in  the  fall  season,  pens  for  the  con- 
finement alive  of  whitefish  until  December  and  later,  and  when  the  glut  consequent 
upon  large  catches  had  been  disposed  of,  the  penned  whitefish  were  taken  from 
the  pens  and  shipped  to  distant  markets.  The  severe  weather  of  winter  served  to 
keep  them  in  a  fresh  condition.  The  profits  derived  from  this  mode  of  procedure 
were  large,  and  these  advantages  ultimately  led  to  the  invention  of  the  method  of 
artificially  freezing  of  fish  by  which  fish  might  be  kept  for  an  indefinite  time,  and 
from  this  was  evolved  the  modern  methods  now  pursued  all  over  the  lakes  of 
holding  fish  in  freezers.  This  discovery  gave  to  the  fishing  industry  a  great 
impetus  and  the  business  was  suddenly  revolutionized.  From  being  prosecuted 
with  small  gangs  or  strings  of  nets  and  with  sail  and  row  boats  by  a  few 
individuals,  the  fishing  being  confined  to  a  few  months  in  the  year,  it  has  now 
grown  to  such  proportions  that  frequently  a  single  fisherman  controls  nets  extend- 
ing twenty-five,  fifty  and  seventy  miles  in  length,  following  his  business  with  the 
use  of  steam  craft  and  fishing  during  all  seasons  of  the  year,  unless  interfered 
with  by  the  rigor  of  the  season. 

During  the  season  of  1891  there  were  fished  in  the  waters  of  this  State  2,692 
miles  of  gill  nets,  sufficient  in  length  to  encircle  the  entire  State  with  nearly  seven 
hundred  miles  to  spare.  There  were  2,028  pound  nets  fished,  having  leaders  meas- 
uring 316  miles,  and  ninety  seines  with  a  length  of  8,175  fathoms.

There  were  about  twenty-five  freezers  with  a  capacity  of  2.500  tons  of  frozen  fish 
and  the   industry   employed   upwards  of   4,000  men. 

The  boats  in  use  were  seventy  steamers,  five  hundred  and  seventy-four  sail  boats, 
three  hundred  and  three  pound  boats  and  five  hundred  and  forty-six  skiflfs. 

The  total  amount  invested  in  nets,  boats,  lands  and  buildings  was  $1,104,960.50.

The  vigorous  prosecution  of  the  fisheries,  without  any  restraint  upon  the  meth- 
ods pursued,  has  resulted  in  a  depletion  of  the  waters,  and  they  are  threatened 
with  decay  and  perhaps  absolute  extinction  unless  some  steps  are  taken  by  the 
State  to  arrest  it.  Those  interested  in  these  matters  have  sought  to  propose  means 
by  which  the  fisheries  may  be  conserved  in  the  interests  of  the  people,  and  the 
means  suggested  are  as  follows: 

1.  The  passage  of  necessary  restrictive  legislation  to  control  the  fishermen  in 
methods  of  capture; 

(a)  By  making  it  unlawful  to  take  at  any  time  or  in  any  season  of  the  year 
young  and  immature  fish  which  have   not   reached  the  spawning  age,   and 

(6)  The  establishment  of  a  close  season  during  the  spawning  period,  which  will 
allow  the  fish  to  perform  the  function  of  reproduction  undisturbed. 

2.  The  impregnation  of  the  ova  artificially  and  the  hatching  of  the  eggs  in  suit- 
able hatcheries,  whereby  the  loss  of  ova  may  be  reduced  to  the  minimum,  such 
operations  to  be  conducted  on  a  liberal  scale. 

Artificial  impregnation  %as  been  demonstrated  to  be  highly  successful,  the  his- 
tory of  the  treatment  of  the  ova  of  the  salmonidaj  for  a  series  of  years  showing 
that  with  proper  care  the  percentage  of  loss  on  ova  taken  will  not  exceed  ten 
per  cent. 

The  State  of  Michigan  at  an  early  period  became  impressed  with  the  importance 
of  fish  culture  and  has  made  liberal  appropriations  for  the  conduct  of  this  work. 

It  has  now,  established  and  in  operation,  four  hatcheries.  Two  of  these  hatch- 
eries are  devoted  to  the  propagation  of  commercial  fish,  like  the  whitefish  and  pike 
perch  or  wall-eyed  pike,  one  for  the  pi'opagation  of  brook  trout,  California  or 
mountain   trout,  and   the  brown  trout  of   Europe,  and  one  for  the  cultivation  and 

23

breeding  of  carp.  It  is  intended  soon  to  established  a  station  for  the  culture  and 
propagation  of  the  black  bass. 

The  annual  output  of  whitefish  fry  for  the  past  four  years  has  been  upwards  of 
100,000,000,  and  during  the  spring  of  1893  it  will  reach  nearly  if  not  quite 
200,000,000. 

The  average  output  of  pike  perch  or  wall- eyed  pike  for  the  same  period  has 
been  upwards  of  30,000,000. 

The  output  of  all  varieties  of  trout  averages  about  3,000,000  yearly,  and  of  carp 
about  5,000. 

In  addition  to  this  there  have  been  distributed  about  200,000  salmon  trout  fry 
annually  for  the  last  two  years,  2,500,000  white  bass  and  273,000  silver  eels. 

The  success  of  these  operations  have  been  eminently  satisfactory.  Before  the 
year  1840  the  brook  trout  was  unknown  in  the  waters  of  the  lower  peninsula,  with 
the  exception  of  one  or  two  streams.  Today  there  is  excellent  fishing  in  more 
than  fifty  counties,  and  the  work  is  popular  everywhere. 


STATE    BOARD    OF    FISH    COMMISSIONERS. 
BY    GEO.     D.    MUSSEY. 

In  1873  an  act  was  passed  by  the  legislature  creating  this  board  and  the  Gover- 
nor appointed  (two  commissioners,  who,  with  himself,  constituted  the  board.  In 
1875  the  board  was  reorganized,  the  statute  having  been  so  amended  as  to  provide 
for  three  commissioners,  one  for  two  years,  one  for  four  years  and  one  for  six 
years,  and  their  successors  to  be  appointed  to  a  term  of  six  years  each.  The  pre- 
sent board  consists  of  Hoyt  Post  and  Herschel  Whittaker  of  Detroit  and  Horace  W. 
Davis  of  Grand  Rapids.  The  commissioners  receive  no  compensation  whatever,  but 
are  allowed  their  actual  expenses  when  traveling  on  the  business  of  the  board.  The 
work  is  a  labor  of  love,  which  every  commissioner  can  testify  is  an  expensive  one 
for  him. 

The  duty  of  the  board  is  to  conduct  the  artificial  propagation  of  such  varieties 
of  food  fish  as  it  may  deem  best  and  to  distribute  the  same  gratuitously  in  the 
waters  of  the  great  lakes  and  the  rivers  and  straits  connecting  them,  or  in  the 
inland  lakes  and  streams  upon  the  application  of  some  person  interested  in  the 
waters  sought  to  be  stocked;  the  only  condition  being  that  the  waters  thus  supplied 
with  fish  by  this  board  shall  be  open  to  the  public  for  fishing  by  lawful  methods 
and  at  lawful  times. 

The  varieties  now  propagated  are  the  whitefish,  lake  or  salmon  trout,  pike-perch 
or  wall-eyed  pike,  brook  trout,  California  or  mountain  trout,  the  brown  trout  of 
Germany,  and  the  German  carp.  The  distribution  of  whitefish  fry  is  confined 
exclusively  to  the  great  lakes  and  rivers  connecting  them;  all  other  varieties  are 
furnished  upon  the  application  of  those  interested  in  the  stocking  of  the  inland 
waters  in  their  immediate  vicinity.  Those  wishing  fish  for  stocking  streams,  lakes 
or  ponds  should  write  to  the  Michigan  fish  commission,  Detroit,  for  blanks,  which 
will  be  furnished  on  request  and  which  when  filled   up  and  returned  will  enable 


Fisheries.  179 


the  board  to  determine  the  kind  and  quantity  needed  for  the  waters  to  be 
supplied. 

Previous  to  the  organization  of  this  board  there  were  very  few  streams  in  the 
lower  peninsula  of  this  State  in  which  brook  trout  were  native,  and  below  a  line 
from  Petoskey  to  Saginaw  absolutely  no  brook  trout  were  to  be  found.  There  are 
now  nine  hundred  and  seventy-six  streams  in  the  lower  peninsula,  distributed 
through  fifty-six  counties,  which  have  been  stocked  by  this  board,  all  open  to  fish- 
ing and  in  which  this  most  valuable  of  game  fishes  may  be  found  in  comparative 
abundance.  Besides  this,  a  large  number  of  streams  have  been  partially  stocked 
with  brook  trout  in  several  other  counties  of  the  lower  peninsula  and  in  a  number 
of  counties  in  the  upper  peninsula.  These  streams  will  be  open  for  fishing  in 
from  one  to  two  years. 

The  State  is  rapidly  acquiring  a  wide  reputation  for  its  splendid  trout  fishing 
and  the  amount  of  money  brought  into  the  State  every  season  by  sportsmen  and 
tourists  on  account  of  the  trout  fishing  is  enormous,  aggregating  many  thousands 
of  dollars.  No  enterprise  in  which  the  State  is  engaged  returns  so  directly  to 
every  class  of  its  people  such  large  and  important  benefits  as  do  the  results  of  the 
work  of  the  Michigan  fish  commission.  No  other  State  in  the  union  propagates  so 
large  a  number  of  fish  each  year,  and  no  State  produces  fry  at  so  small  a  cost  per 
thousand. 

The  State  now  has  four  hatching  stations,  located  at  Detroit,  Paris,  Sault  Ste. 
Marie  and  Glenwood.  At  Detroit  is  the  whitefish  and  wall-eyed  pike  hatchery. 
This  is  the  largest  and  most  complete  whitefish  hatchery  in  the  world.  It  con- 
tains 1,050  hatching  jars,  each  capable  of  running  four  quarts  of  eggs;  a  total 
capacity  of  over  150,000,000  of  whitefish  eggs. 

At  Paris,  Mecosta  county,  is  the  hatchery  for  all  varieties  of  trout.  This  is  one 
of  the  best  hatcheries  in  the  United  States,  and  while  there  may  be  one  or  two 
larger  ones,  there  are  none  which  excel  it  in  its  construction  or  adaptability  for 
the  hatching  of  trout.  Its  capacity  is  about  5,000,000  of  fry  per  year.  It  has 
never  been  filled  to  its  fullest  capacity. 

At  Sault  Ste.  Marie  is  a  hatchery  for  whitefish  and  trout.  It  was  built  as  an 
experiment  and  after  having  been  run  two  years  has  proved  a  success  for  both 
varieties.  It  will  undoubtedly  be  continued  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  or  at  some  other 
point   in   the   upper  peninsula. 

At  Glenwood  are  the  carp  and  goldfish  ponds.  This  station  has  always  been 
successful  and  the  State  now  breeds  more  carp  than  is  needed  to  supply  the 
demand.  The  hatching  of  goldfish  at  this  station  has  also  been  attended  with 
success  and   soon   this  beautiful   fish  will   be  ready  for  public  distribution. 

The  following  is  a  statement  of  fry  of  all  kinds  hatched  and  distributed  since 
the  organization  of   the  board   up   to  January   1,  1893: 


Whitefish 740,965,500

In  addition  to  the  work  of  propagating  fish,  the  board  some  years  ago  inaug- 
urated an  examination  of  the  inland  lakes  of  the  State,  commencing  with  the 
southern  tier  of  counties,  intending  eventually  to  examine  all  the  lakes  in  the 
lower  peninsula  at  least.  This  work  has  been  continued  for  seven  years  and 
accurate  and  complete  records  of  the  examination  of  each  lake  are  kept,  each 
year's  reports  being  bound  in  separate  and  permanent  volumes,  so  that  in  the 
end  a  complete  history  of  each  lake  will  be  on  file  and  the  board  will  thereby 
be  enabled  to  accurately  determine  what  fish  are  best  suited  for  the  waters  of 
any  given  lake.  This  board  was  the  first  to  undertake  this  work,  and  it  is  a  feat- 
ure that  has  met  the  approval  and  high  commendation  of  all  the  fish  commis- 
sioners from  other  states  who  have  learned  of   it. 

For  nearly  two  years  the  board  has  employed  a  statistical  agent  whose  busi- 
ness it  is  to  visit  all  of  the  fisheries  of  the  State  and  get  from  the  proprietors  a 
report  of  their  catch,  which  the  law  requires  them  to  furnish  to  this  board.  A 
very  competent  man  was  secured  and  the  statistics  now  obtained  are  of  great  value, 
showing,  as  they  do,  notwithstanding  the  greatly  improved  methods  of  fishing  and 
the  acknowledged  destruction  of  immense  numbers  of  immature  whitefish,  that 
through  the  constant  replenishing  of  the  waters  by  this  board  the  annual  catch 
of  whitefish  falls  but  little  short  of  that  of  the  much  hardier  and  naturally  more 
numerous  salmon  trout.  Without  the  efforts  of  the  Michigan  fish  commission 
very  few  whitefish  would  now  be  caught  in  the  waters  of  this  State. 

The  capital  invested  in  the  commercial  fisheries  of  the  State  exceeds  one  mill- 
ion of  dollars.  The  annual  catch  exceeds  thirty-five  millions  of  pounds,  having 
a  wholesale  value  of  over  one  million  of  dollars.  More  than  twenty-nine  hundred 
miles  of  nets  are  in  use  every  year,  and  employment  is  furnished  to  about  forty - 
five  hundred  men. 

This  board  has,  for  the  last  two  years,  also  employed  a  scientist,  who  has  made 
investigations  as  directed  by  the  board,  and  who  has  already  largely  increased  the 
knowledge  of  certain  fishes.  His  investigations  so  far  have  been  confined  princi- 
pally to  the  wall-eyed  pike,  one  of  the  most  valuable,  as  well  as  one  of  the  most 
difficult  fish  to  handle  and  propagate,  on  account  of  the  great  loss  in  hatching. 
The  investigations  of  this  gentleman  have  not  only  led  to  improved  methods  of 
handling,  but  have  also  added  largely  to  the  literature  on  the  subject,  articles  on 
the  development  of  the  wall-eyed  pike  having  been  written  by  him  and  published 
by  this  board,  which  have  met  with  the  flattering  approval  of  scientists  in  all  of 
the  states  and  in  many  foreign  countries. 

This  board  provides  fish  for  the  farmer,  the  mechanic,  the  laborer,  the  sports- 
man and  for  commerce.  The  rich  and  the  poor  are  benefited  alike  by  the  work  of 
the  board.  It  has  always  been  true  that  the  Michigan  fish  commission  is  the 
friend  of  all  the  people;  it  is  rapidly  becoming  true  that  all  the  people  are  friends 
of  the  Michigan  fish  commission. 


MICHIGAN  SOLDIERS'   HOME. 


The  Michigan  Soldiers"  Home,  established  in  1885,  is  situated  on  Grand  river 
three  miles  north  of  the  center  of  the  city  of  Grand  Rapids,  on  a  plat  of  ground 
containing  132  acres,  which  was  donated  by  the  city  of  Grand  Rapids  at  a  cost 
of  $16,500.  The  building,  which  v/ill  accommodate  400  members,  was  completed 
December  1,  1886,  at  a  cost  of  $99,667.57.  The  legislative  appropriations  were: 
For  maintenance  of  inmates  for  1885,  $10,000;  for  1886,  $10,000;  and  for  the  erec- 
tion of  buildings  and  preparing  of  grounds,  $100,000.  The  home  has  at  present  335 
inmates ;  on  leave  of  absence,  35.  Total  enrollment  for  last  fiscal  year,  212;  pres- 
ent value  of  its  property,  $168,990.  The  institution  is  designed  to  furnish  a  home 
for  "all  honorably  discharged  soldiers,  sailors  and  marines,  who  served  in  the  army 
or  navy  of  the  United  States  in  the  late  war  of  the  rebellion,  and  who  are  disabled 
by  disease,  wounds  or  otherwise,  who  have  no  adequate  means  of  support, 
and  by  reason  of  disability  are  incapable  of  earning  their  living,  and  who  would 
be  otherwise  dependent  upon  public  or  private  charity."  To  be  entitled,  however, 
to  the  privileges  of  the  home,  applicants,  must  have  resided  in  Michigan  one  year 
preceding  the  passage  of  the  act  establishing  the  home,  or  they  must  have  served 
in   a  Michigan  regiment,  or  have  been   accredited  to  Michigan. 

The  supervision  and  government  of  the  home  is  vested  in  a  board  of  managers 
consisting  of  the  Governor,  who  is  ex  officio  chairman,  and  six  members, 
appointed  by  the  Governor,  for  a  term  of  six  years.  Public  acts  No.  152,  1885. 
The  legislative  appropriation  for  1891  and  1892  was  $175,750  for  the  two  years; 
1891  the  amount  was  $91,000,  and  1892,  $84,750.

MICHIGAN  AS  A  SUMMER  RESORT. 


No  state  in  the  union  offers  equal  advantages  to  the  resorter.  with  its  5,000 
small  lakes  and  web  work  of  streams  all  stocked  with  gamy  fish,  and  beautiful 
and  healthy  surroundings  all  easy  of  access,  and  at  the  same  time  as  wild  as  the 
most  romantic  could  desire.  Streams  filled  with  trout,  running  through  a  country 
where  deer  and  bear  are  to  be  found,  with  surroundings  as  wild  and  primitive  as 
though  the  destructive  hand  of  man  had  never  touched  it,  and  at  the  same  time 
so  close  to  excellent  hotels  and  camping  grounds  that  no  hardships  need  be  experi- 
enced as  is  so  often    necessary  in  order  to  enjoy   such  things  in  other  places. 

We  have  one  thousand  six  hundred  miles  of  coast  line,  with  hardly  a  stretch  of 
five  miles  without  a  grand  location  for  camping  or  a  resort  already  established. 
The  variety  of  "  outing  places  "  is  so  complete  that  to  fail  to  be  pleased  in  Michi- 
gan would  indicate  the  impossibility  to  please.  All  classes  of  entertainment  are 
found,  from  the  grand  modern  hotel,  as  fine  as  the  most  lavish  could  wish,  to 
the  small  fishing  camp;  the  fashionable  resorts  where  expenses  are  not  consid- 
ered, to  the  small  camp  with  expenses  cut  down  to  less  than  fifty  cents  per 
day  all  told.  As  an  evidence  of  the  popularity  of  Michigan  resorts,  the  number 
of  resorters  are  largely  increasing  each  year  and  an  annual  visit  to  the  old 
camping  ground  is  looked  forward  to  with  pleasure.  Thousands  of  beautiful 
sites  on  quiet  little  lakes  or  on  rivers  are  being  bought  by  clubs  and  club 
houses  built.  This  is  within  reach  of  everybody,  as  the  land  can  be  bought  for 
from  S1.25  to  §25  per  acre  and  a  small  outlay  in  buildings  will  furnish  accom- 
modations  to   a  club. 

In  the  north  half  of  the  lower  peninsula  and  in  the  upper  peninsula  there  is 
not  a  county  that  has  no  lakes  or  streams.  The  southern  part  of  the  State  is 
equally  well  provided  with  lakes  and  rivers,  but  lacks  the  wild  element  and 
cheapness  of  land,  being  more  thickly  settled.  The  western  shore  of  the  lower 
peninsula  is  dotted  with  resorts  from  Berrien  to  Emmet  county.  Many  have 
been  improved  at  large  expense.  Macatawa  park  at  Holland  is  a  very  elegant 
resort  and  is  largely  patronized  by  excursions  from  Grand  Rapids  and  other 
cities.  Hackley  park  assembly  is  located  near  Muskegon  and  has  connection  with 
the  city  by  railroad,  boats,  etc.  It  is  located  on  beautiful  bluffs,  with  a  grand 
view  of  Lake  Michigan.  Charles  Hackley,  a  very  liberal  gentleman  of  Muskegon, 
with  a  keen  sense  of  the  beautiful,  donated  a  large  amount  of  money  to  be 
vised  in  beautifying  this  place,  and  it  was  named  by  Bishop  Newman  of  Wash- 
ington, D.   C,   the   "  Gem   of  the  Chautauquas."     The    grounds   are    owned  by  the

Methodist  association  who  have  a  splendid  auditorium  and  other  buildings,  water 
works  and  electric  light  plant.  The  W.  C.  T.  U.  and  teachers'  association  also 
are  erecting  buildings.  From  here  to  Grand  Traverse  we  have  no  means  of 
knowing  how  many  resorts  and  club  houses  are  located.  Going  north,  the  tourist 
on  a  vessel  can  hardly  get  out  of  sight  of  one  resort  or  club  house  before 
another  comes  in  sight.  Many  church  organizations  and  societies  have  estab- 
lished resorts.  Many  old  ones,  such  as  Old  Mission,  We-que-ton-sing,  Omena. 
Harbor  Point,  Bay  View.  We  will  not  attempt  to  mention  each,  for  want  of 
space,  but  the  tourist  need  experience  no  difficulty  in  finding  a  place  enchanting. 
The  group  of  islands  forming  Manitou  county  are  all  interesting  and  many 
lovely  locations  are  there.  Across  the  water,  from  Menominee,  passing  Mackinac 
Island,  the  Les  Cheneaux,  St.  Marys  river,  passing  into  Lake  Superior,  and  coast- 
ing on  the  borders  of  the  State,  the  most  roniantic  and  daring  could  be  satis- 
fled.  There  are  beauties  and  wonders  on  the  shore  of  Lake  Superior  but  few 
know   anything  of. 

All  points  are  reached  by  rail  or  water  to  within  a  few  miles  and  the  trip 
to  and  from  all  such  places  is  made  cheaply  and  with  comfort.  On  the  east 
border  of  the  State  the  same  condition  is  found.  Lake  Huron,  a  grand  body 
of  water,  St.  Clair  river,  St.  Clair  lake,  Detroit  river — a  thousand  pages  would 
not  be   sufficient  to   thoroughly   describe  all   the  interesting  locations. 

Deer,  bear,  porcupine,  badgers,  wild  cats,  foxes  and  small  game  are  here  but 
are  not  plenty,  only  in  certain  localities.  Of  wild  geese  and  ducks  and  other 
feathered  game  there  is  a  fair  supply.  Of  snakes  there  are  some,  but  not  near 
so  many  as  in  states  farther  south.  The  fish  and  game  laws  of  the  State  are 
calculated   to  protect  and   increase,   making   the  sport   better   each  year. 

TRANSPORTATION. 

Resorts  are  ,  reached  by  water  from  all  directions,  on  elegant  vessels,  and  on 
land  by  railway.  Very  few  stage  coaches  or  canals.  It  costs  but  little  more  to 
enjoy  the  luxury  of   a  steamer  trip  than  to  stay  at  home. 


EMIGRATION. 


Emigrants  who  float  in  with  the  tide  will  not  find  Michigan  their  El  Dorado. 
While  Michigan  is  an  open  field  for  intelligent,  enterprising  and  honest  workers,  it 
has  no  department  for  the  indolent  or  vicious  class.  The  long  winters  admonish 
us  that  preparations  must  be  made  during  summer  for  the  coming  winter. 

This  proves  a  great  incentive  to  exertion,  and  the  work  of  preparing  for  win- 
ter creates  a  habit  of  preparing  for  coming  winters  in  the  future.  Michigan  is 
a  poor  place  to  idle  away  time  and  trust  in  providence  for  the  future  supply  until 
you  have  positive  assurance  that  providence  will  trust  you.  The  lazy,  indolent 
and  dishonest  class   will  find  no  opening  in  Michigan. 

The  Lord  hates  a  lazy  man  and  the  law  takes  care  of  the  dishonest.  Michigan 
is  a  hive  of  industry,  with  no  use  for  drones.  The  object  in  migrating  is  generally 
to  better  the  situation.  The  capitalist  may  see  better  investment  for  his  money, 
the  manufacturer  advantages  justifying  removal,  the  laborer  remunerative  employ- 
ment, the  farmer  land  within  his  power  to  own.  For  such  investigation,  we  offer 
this  book  as  a  guide  or  help.  To  induce  immigration  is  not  the  prime  object  of 
this  work.  While  additions  to  our  population,  if  of  the  right  kind,  are  always 
desirable  and  welcome,  we  desire  to  hold  out  no  false  inducements. 

Skilled  labor  in  Michigan  is  remunerated  much  the  same  as  in  other  states. 
Although  manufacturing  is  carried  on  largely,  and  the  products  of  the  mines  and 
manufactories  are  almost  unlimited,  it  is  not  intended  to  convey  the  idea  that 
labor,  skilled,  clerical  or  common,  is  demanded  at  exorbitant  salaries  and  wages. 
It  is  much  the  same  as  in  other  states.  Let  no  one  suppose  that  elegant  positions, 
fat  jobs  or  first-class  employment  at  big  wages  await  all  comers.  Such  is  not  the 
case.  Many  stranded  wrecks  result  from  false  impressions.  After  reading  booming 
articles  in  which  the  truth  is  entirely  ignored,  with  feverish  haste  sacrifices  are 
made,  little  savings  are  used,  in  the  senseless  rush  to  worse  than  fairy  lands,  only 
to  find  nothing  as  represented  and  anticipated,  but  simply  to  realize  that  somebody 
lied.  The  finely  written  and  elaborately  illustrated  matter  published  by  railroad 
land  agents  and  laud  companies  to  induce  buyers,  should  be  taken  at  a  very 
large  discount,  and  statements  allowed  a  large  percentage  for  shrinkage.  The 
luckless  immigrant  with  false  impressions,  induced  by  misleading  statements,  cuts 
loose  his  moorings  and  joins  the  ranks  of  the  seekers  of  some  "  ignis-fatuus,"  many 
to  strand  in  some  unpromising  or  uninhabitable  country,  without  friends  or  means 
of  support,  with  no  bright  prospect  ahead.  With  inevitable  ruin,  want, 
24

deprivation,  and  destitution  surrounding  him,  family  begging  for  the  most 
meager  necessities  of  life,  cold,  hungry,  disappointed,  and,  if  possessing  less  than 
iron  nerve,  completely  demoralized.  No  situation  can  be  more  terrible.  He 
retraces  his  weary  way  to  his  former  home  and,  if  of  the  right  sort,  devotes  the 
balance  of  his  life  to  repair  his  loss.  This  is  not  fiction;  many,  too  many,  can 
attest  its  truthfulness.  Michigan  has  its  share  of  paupers  and  unfortunates  and 
we  sincerely  and  earnestly  desire  to  avoid  making  more.  If  you  desire  to  locate  in 
Michigan,  for  whatever  purpose,  we  advise  investigation,  full  and  satisfactory.  The 
State  will  bear  it.  If  what  you  want  is  not  found  here,  no  passport  is  required  to 
pass  on.  If  Michigan  does  not  suit  you,  shake  its  dust  from  your  feet  and  seek 
your  tenting  ground  in  some  other  part  of  the  earth.  The  Creator  providentially 
ordained  that  mankind  should  be  constituted  with  different  likes  and  dislikes. 
While  the  Ploridian  loves  his  sunny  home  and  orange  grove,  the  northern  Mich- 
igander  will  travel  miles  on  his  snow  shoes  to  inform  you  that  he  would  not 
exchange.    First  determine  what  you  want,  then  learn  where  it  is  to  be  found. 

INVESTIGATION. 

Many  do  not  investigate  at  all,  but  accept  the  gilded  statements  of  the  boomer 
with  blind  faith  and  repeat  the  drama  of  the  spider  and  the  fly.  Others  investi- 
gate, but  how?  With  a  map  spread  out  before  them  a  bird's  eye  view  of  the 
State  is  had  and  they  know  all  about  it.  They  read  the  report  of  a  potato  crop, 
possibly  the  report  of  some  choice  acre,  and  immediately  jump  at  the  conclusion  that 
that  locality  is  the  great  potato  country.  Maps  and  statistical  reports  are  good  as  far 
as  they  go,  but  when  you  arrive  at  any  certain  locality  and  look  around,  you  can 
see  but  a  short  distance,  beyond  which  you  know  nothing,  and  in  many  cases 
no  one  can  tell  you.  Of  the  whole  number  of  sections  of  land  in  a  state  no  two 
are  alike.  They  may  be  similar.  Thousands  of  acres  are  used  for  farming  in 
Michigan  not  fit  for  the  business,  and  at  the  same  time  thousands  of  acres  of 
first  class  land  remains  unused.  Proper  investigation  would  have  reversed  this 
matter.  No  State  in  the  union  possesses  the  variety  of  soils  and  location  that 
Michigan  does,  from  the  extremely  poor  to  the  best.  But  you  cannot  look  over 
soils  and  compare  them  as  you  would  the  wares  in  a  tin  shop.  Location  without 
proper  investigation  is  a  leap  in  the  dark.  It  would  not  be  policy,  if  possible,  to 
sell  by  forced  sale 'and  have  occupied  every  acre  of  vacant  or  unused  land  in  the 
State.  No  state  can  prosper  and  flourish  with  a  dissatisfied  citizenship,  no  more 
than  can  a  manufactory  flourish  witfi  dissatisfied  workmen.  The  same  condition 
pervades  all  the  ramifications  of  business  and  social  life,  even  from  the  general 
government  down  to  the  humblest  home.  Success  has  and  always  will  be  the 
American's  watchword.  Hence,  individual  success  portends  State  and  national 
success.  Success  depends  upon  exertion,  exertion  upon  opportunity,  opportunity 
upon  investigation,  plain,  positive   and  personal. 


SHIP  YARDS. 


The  great  and  increasing  commerce  of  the  lakes  makes  vessel  building  an 
important  factor  in  the  industries  of  the  State.  When  it  is  taken  into  consid- 
eration that  a  large  part  of  the  labor  of  ship  building  is  skilled  labor,  for 
which  wages  much  better  than  common  labor  is  paid,  it  will  readily  be  seen 
that  a  vast  amount  of  money  is  distributed  through  this  channel. 

In  ship  building,  Wayne  county  leads  as  to  numbers  but  Bay  very  far  exceeds 
any  other  as  to  tonnage.  The  following  tables  show  the  kind  of  vessels,  tonnage, 
etc.:

MICHIGAN   STATE   TROOPS 


BY   C.    L.   EATON,    ADJUTANT    GENERAL. 


Michigan's  military  force  comprises  five  regiments  of  infantry  with  an  aggre- 
gate strength  of  nearly  three  thousand  men.  Each  regiment  has  eight  companies 
and  is  divided  into  two  battalions.  The  personnel  of  the  men  comprising  this 
force  is  first  class.  A  large  majority  of  its  membership  is  made  up  of  our  suc- 
cessful, energetic  and  pushing  young  business  men,  who  manifest  deep  interest 
in  the  organization.  The  first  regiment  has  one  company  at  each  of  the  follow- 
ing places,  viz.:  Ann  Arbor,  Adrian,  Tecumseh,  Lansing,  Mason,  Ypsilanti  and 
two  at  Jackson. 

The  second  regiment  has  three  companies  at  Grand  Rapids  and  one  each  at 
Coldwater,   Kalamazoo,  Three  Rivers,   Grand   Haven   and   Ionia. 

The  companies  of  the  third  are  located  respectively  at  Flint,  Alpena,  Bay  City, 
Saginaw,  East  Saginaw,  Port  Huron,  Owosso  and   Cheboygan. 

The  fourth  regiment,  with  the  exception  of  one  company  (G,  of  Monroe),  is 
located   in   the   city   of   Detroit. 

The  fifth  regiment  has  five  companies,  located  at  Calumet,  Menominee,  Houghton, 
Marquette  and  Ironwood  in  the  upper  peninsula,  but  three  of  its  companies, 
those  at  Big  Rapids,  Manistee  and  Muskegon  being  below  the  straits.  The 
brigade  is  under  command  of  Brig.  Gen.  E.  W.  Bowen,  of  Ypsilanti.  The  regi- 
ments are  commanded  in  their  numerical  order  by  Col.  John  E.  Tyrrell  of  Jack- 
son, Col.  C.  H.  Rose  of  Grand  Rapids,  Col.  C.  R.  Hawley  of  Bay  City,  Col,  P. 
J.  Sheahan  of  Detroit  and  Col.   F.   B.  Lyon  of   Calumet. 

Money  for  the  support  of  our  military  system  is  raised  by  an  annual  tax  of 
four  cents  per  capita.  It  is  believed  by  the  writer  that  the  Michigan  State 
troops  are  as  well  officered  as  are  those  of  any  state  in  the  union,  and  that 
in  discipline,  personal  appearance,  gentlemanly  and  soldierly  conduct,  the  Michi- 
gan boys  are   not   excelled  by   those   of   any   of  our   sister   states. 


HEALTH   IN    MICHIGAN. 


BY    HENRY   B.    BAKER,    M.   D.,    SECRETARY   OF   THE   STATE   BOARD   OF   HEALTH. 


Man  makes  most  rapid  and  greatest  progress  in  that  belt  or  zone  within  which 
the  average  annual  temperature  does  not  much  exceed  60°  F.  or  fall  much  below 
45°  F.  As  regards  productiveness  of  soil,  and  consequent  prosperity  in  food  sup- 
plies, the  warmer  portion  of  the  zone  is  believed  to  be  favorable,  but  the  evidence 
seems  conclusive  that  for  hardiness  of  constitution  and  general  and  special  health- 
fulness  the  coldest  portion  excels.  The  average  annual  temperature  in  central 
Michigan  is  about  46.5°  F.  But  Michigan  is  exceptionally  well  situated  for  cli- 
matic influences.  Extreme  heat  and  extreme  cold  endanger  life  and  health.  Mich- 
igan being  surrounded,  except  on  the  south,  by  large  bodies  of  water,  the  tempera- 
ture in  summer  is  not  as  high  as  it  otherwise  would  be,  and  in  winter  it  is  not  as 
low.  How  this  is  favorable  to  human  health  may  perhaps  be  better  appreciated 
by  noticing  how  it  affects  tender  plant  life;  it  is  well  known  that  peach  trees  are 
easily  killed  by  extreme  cold,  yet  western  Michigan  is  remarkable  for  its  peach 
crops,  made  possible  in  this  latitude  by  the  mildness  of  the  winter  climate,  modi- 
fied as  it  is  by  the  large  bodies  of  water  in  the  great  lakes  which  nearly  surround 
the  State.  This  modification  of  the  winter  climate  in  Michigan  is  undoubtedly 
favorable  to  human  health,  by  lessening  the  danger  from  inflammation  of  the 
lungs,  bronchitis,  influenza,  etc.;  and  the  cooling  of  the  air  in  summer  by  the 
water  of  the  great  lakes  is  favorable  by  lessening  the  danger  from  diarrhea,  dysen- 
tery, and  the  other  diseases  which  are   usually   coincident  with  high   temperatures. 

Many  of  the  diseases  which  most  commonly  kill  people  are  spread  by  ignorant 
and  careless  disregard  of  sanitary  law.  Safety  from  such  diseases  is  impossible  in 
states  and  in  communities  where  such  disregard  is  common.  In  Michigan  the  peo- 
ple are  fast  becoming  active  in  efforts  for  the  general  promotion  of  the  public 
health.  It  was  one  of  the  first  states  in  the  union  to  establish  a  State  Board  of 
Health,  and    local    boards  of  health  are   now  quite  generally    organized  throughout 

25 


194  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

the  State.  The  people  seem  to  place  a  high  estimate  upon  the  value  of  human  life 
and  health;  during  the  session  of  1881  the  State  legislature  passed  forty-eight  acts 
bearing  directly  or  indirectly  upon  this  subject.  No  man  can  live  to  himself 
alone, — he  is  greatly  dependent  upon  his  surroundings  and  fellow  citizens  for 
safety  to  life  and  health.  One  of  the  greatest  recommendations  for  Michigan  as  a 
State  to  live  in  is  the  intelligent  regard  of  its  citizens  for  human  life  and  health. 
The  conditions  in  Michigan  being  favorable  for  public  health  and  happiness, 
what  is  the  positive  evidence  of  the  general  result,  as  shown  by  the  death  rate? 
Is  it  possible  to  compare  the  death  rate  in  Michigan  with  that  in  other  states 
and  countries?  Unfortunately  for  our  present  purpose,  governments  have  nowhere 
paid  sufficient  attention  to  this  subject  of  life  and  health  to  enable  one  to  make 
accurate  and  complete  comparisons  of  different  states  or  countries.  Considering 
such  masses  of  statistics  as  are  supplied  by  the  census  of  Great  Britain  and  of 
the  United  States,  etc.,  this  may  seem  strange,  but  it  is  true.  The  actual  death 
rate  in  these  countries  has  not  yet  been  learned,  though  for  many  cities  it  is 
quite  closely  ascertained.  Censuses  of  states  and  countries  collect  statements  of 
deaths  which  occurred  during  the  year  preceding  the  census,  and  many  deaths 
are  omitted  because  of  movements  of  relatives  and  friends,  and  the  forgetfulness 
of  other  people.  The  omissions  are  probably  not  the  same  in  all  states,  because 
the  movements  of  the  inhabitants  are  not  equal.  According  to  the  United  States 
censuses  preceding  that  of  1880  (the  results  of  which  are  not  yet  published)  Mich- 
igan has  had  a  very  low  death  rate,  lower  than  that  of  most  other  states.  After 
the  census  of  1870,  the  writer  undertook  to  ascertain,  by  means  of  statistics  col- 
lected for  the  same  time  by  another  set  of  men  than  the  census  marshals,  what 
proportion  of  the  deaths  in  Michigan  were  omitted  and  what  the  actual  death 
rate  was.  A  "Life  Table,"  similar  to  those  employed  by  insurance  companies 
was  then  made,  showing  for  Michigan  the  average  years  of  life  after  each  age, 
and  for  persons  of  each  sex  and  at  every  age  the  probable  duration  of  life  in 
Michigan.  Obviously  it  will  not  do  to  compare  a  death  rate  thus  obtained  with 
the  death  rate  of  any  state  ascertained  directly  from  the  United  States  census, 
because,  to  make  my  life  table  for  Michigan,  the  deaths  by  the  census  were 
nearly  doubled — being  multiplied  by  1.86;  but  even  then  the  death  rate  was  so 
small  that  it  became  desirable  to  compare  it  with  an  exceptionally  low  one. 
Dr.  Wm.  Farr,  the  most  eminent  vital  statistician,  has  constructed  a  life  table  for 
the  healthy  districts  of  England,  concerning  which  he  has  said: 

"We  have  no  means  of  ascertaining  what  the  rate  of  mortality  would  be  among 
men  living  in  the  most  favorable  sanitary  conditions;  otherwise  observations  for 
a  term  of  years  on  a  considerable  number  of  such  persons  would  supply  a  stand- 
ard rate  with  which  other  rates  could  be  compared.  In  the  absence  of  such  a 
standard,  the  districts  of  England  in  which  the  mortality  rate  did  not  exceed 
seventeen  annual  deaths  in  1,000  living  have  been  selected  as  the  basis  of  a 
new   life  table." 

Comparing  my  life  table  for  Michigan  with  Dr.  Farr's  life  table  of  the  healthy 
districts  of  England  it  is  found  that  they  are  almost  identical,  for  all  ages  except 
under  five  years  and  over  eighty  years,  the  exception  under  five  years  being 
explained  in  part  by  the  fact  that  for  the  Michigan  table  the  still-births  were 
counted  as  deaths,  while  in  England  they  were  not;  the  exception  over  eighty 
years  being   that    among    both   males    and    females  the   death   rate   seemed   to   be 


Health   in    Michigan.  '  195 


less  in  Michigan  than  in  England.  The  total  annual  death  rate  in  all  England 
is  about  twenty-two  per  thousand  inhabitants.  The  total  annual  death  rate  in 
Michigan  was,  according  to  my  life  table,  about  seventeen  and  four-tenths  per 
thousand  inhabitants.  The  inhabitants  of  Michigan  now  number  nearly  1,700,000. 
In  that  number  of  people  the  difference  between  a  death  rate  of  twenty-two  and 
one  of  seventeen  and  four-tenths  per  thousand  amounts  to  over  7,500  lives;  and 
according  to  the  Michigan  life  table,  this  number  of  persons  are  saved  in  each 
year  over  what  would  die  if  the  death  rate  in  Michigan  equaled  that  in  all 
England. 

The  foregoing  was  written  in  1881,  and  the  statement  which  I  then  made, 
that  "one  of  the  greatest  recommendations  for  Michigan  as  a  State  to  live  in 
is  the  intelligent  regard  of  its  citizens  for  human  life  and  health,"  is  amply 
borne  out  by  the  following  evidence  of  the  great  number  of  lives  saved  and  cases 
of  sickness  prevented  by  public  health  work,  which  could  only  have  been  accom- 
plished by  the  intelligent   cooperation  of  the  people  with  health  officials. 

PUBLIC    HEALTH   WORK — RESULTS. 

The  public  health  work  in  Michigan  is  well  advanced  and  has  strikingly  reduced 
the  amount  of  sickness  and  deaths  in  the  State. 

Legislative  enactments  provide  for  the  establishment  of  local  boards  of  health 
in  all  townships,  cities  and  villages  in  Michigan.  Each  of  these  local  boards  is 
required  by  law  to  appoint  a  health  officer,  who  shall  be  an  executive  officer  of 
that  board.  Part  of  the  duty  of  the  health  officer  of  each  local  board  is  to  report, 
to  the  Secretary  of  the  State  Board  of  Health,  every  outbreak  of  a  communicable 
disease  which  occurs  in  his  jurisdiction;  and  to  keep  the  secretary  of  the  State 
board  constantly  informed  respecting  every  outbreak  of  such  disease.  On  receipt 
of  outbreak  reports  from  health  officers  (or  from  other  sources),  the  secretary  of 
the  State  board  immediately  sends  the  health  officer  in  whose  jurisdiction  the  dis- 
ease is  reported  to  exist,  instructions  in  regard  to  preventing  the  spread  of  the 
disease,  and  recommends  measures  to  be  adopted  to  prevent  its  recurrence.  Isola- 
tion of  those  sick  with  dangerous  diseases,  and  disinfection  of  all  clothing  and 
other  articles  liable  to  have  become  infected  with  the  germs  of  those  diseases,  are 
two  of  the  most  strongly  emphasized  recommendations  of  the  State  board  to  local 
health  officers.  At  the  end  of  an  outbreak  of  a  communicable  disease,  the  health 
officer  in  whose  jurisdiction  it  occurred  is  required  to  make  a  tinal  report  to  the 
office  of  the  State  board,  stating  the  number  of  cases  and  deaths  which  took  place 
during  the  outbreak,  the  source  of  the  contagium  which  caused  it,  whether  or  not 
the  preventive  measures  of  isolation  and  disinfection  were  resorted  to,  etc.  The 
information  thus  obtained  is  compiled  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  State 
Board  of  Health,  and  from  this  the  first  diagram  in  this  article  in  constructed. 
The  following  diagrams  graphically  illustrate  the  great  reduction  in  the  number 
of  cases  and  deaths  from  several  diseases  in  Michigan. 

The  first  diagram,  relative  to  "isolation  and  disinfection,"  shows  a  very  great 
reduction  of  cases  and  deaths  from  scarlet  fever  and  diphtheria  in  Michigan  dur- 
ing the  five  years,  1886-90,  accomplished  by  isolation  of  the  sick,  and  disinfection 
of  infected  rooms,  clothing,  bedding,  furniture,  etc.,  there  having  been  on  the  aver- 
age about  six  times  as  many  cases  and  six  times  as  many  deaths  in  each  of  the 


196  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

683  outbreaks  in  which  isolation  and  disinfection  were  neglected  as  in  each  of  the 
613  outbreaks  in  which  isolation  and  disinfection  were  enforced.  As  stated  in  the 
foot  note  of  the  first  diagram,  during  the  five  years,  the  total  number  of  out- 
breaks of  scarlet  fever  was  1,857,  total  number  of  cases  11,312,  and  total  number  of 
deaths  591.  If  no  efforts  at  isolation  and  disinfection  had  been  made  and  the 
averages  had  remained  the  same  as  in  the  366  outbreaks  in  which  isolation  and 
disinfection  were  neglected,  the  number  of  cases  would  have  been  24,680  and  the 
deaths  1,281.  Taking  from  these  respectively  the  number  of  cases  and  deaths 
which  occurred  and  there  remains  the  indicated  saving  from  scarlet  fever  of  690 
lives  and  13,368  cases  in  the  five  years.  By  the  same  method  there  is  indicated 
for  the  five  years  a  saving  from  diphtheria  of  2,722  lives  and  15,302  cases,  mak- 
ing a  saving  during  the  five  years  from  the  two  diseases,  scarlet  fever  and  diph- 
theria, of  3,410  lives  and  28,670  cases  of  sickness. 

The  next  diagram,  "  Lives  Saved  by  Public  Health  Work,"  compiled  from  the 
State  department's  vital  statistics  of  Michigan  shows  a  great  reduction  in  the 
death  rate,  indicating  a  saving  of  over  ten  thousand  (10,851)  lives  from  the  three 
diseases,  scarlet  fever,  small-pox  and  typhoid  fever,  by  public  health  work  since 
the  State  Board  of  Health  was  established,  in  the  year  1873.  Diagram  number 
sixteen  shows  a  reduction  of  over  half  in  the  sickness  from  scarlet  fever  during 
the  five  years,  (1887-91,  compared  with  the  five  years,  1877-81,  these  two  periods 
being  ten  years  apart.

SAULT  STE.   MARIE. 


BY   C.    H.    CHAPMAN. 


Sault  Ste.  Marie  has  been,  is  now  and  will  continue  to  be  a  favored  locality; 
a  place  wherein  lai'ge  public  expenditures  will  be  made,  so  long  as  navigation 
and  railway  traffic  continues.  The  Sta^e  of  Michigan  began  large  public  expendi- 
tures here  as  early  as  1837.  Stevens  T.  Mason,  the  first  Governor  of  Michigan, 
after  its  admission  into  the  union  as  a  state,  urged  in  his  message  to  the  legis- 
lature the  importance  of  building  a  ship  canal  around  the  Ste.  Marys  rapids. 
March  21,  1837,  an  act  was  approved  by  the  Governor  appropriating  $25,000  for 
a  survey,  providing  for  maps,  profile,  etc.,  to  be  made,  together  with  an  estimated 
cost  of  the  construction.  The  survey  was  completed  that  year,  but  the  State 
and  general  government  authority  came  into  conflict  over  the  right  to  pass 
through  certain  lands,  and  the  actual  construction,  of  what  has  since  grown  to 
be  the  greatest  ship  canal  in  the  world,  was  not  begun  until  sixteen  years  after 
Governor  Mason  first  called  public  attention  to  this  needed  improvement  of  the 
great  water-ways.  Congress  appropriated  750,000  acres  of  land  to  aid  the  State 
in  building  the  canal  and  locks.  Work  was  begun  June  4,  1853,  and  finished 
on  the  21st  of  May,  1855.  The  canal  was  three-fourths  of  a  mile  in  length,  one 
hundred  feet  wide  and  contained  two  consecutive  locks,  each  350  feet  long,  70 
feet  wide  and  13  feet  depth  of  water.  The  actual  cost  of  the  canal  was  $999,- 
802.46.  From  the  date  of  its  opening  the  lake  traffic  increased  annually  at  such 
a  rate  that  in  1870  the  United  States  government  began  its  improvements  of 
the  canal.  A  new  lock,  515  feet  long  and  80  feet  wide,  with  17  feet  of  water  on 
the  miter  sills  and  with  a  lift  of  18i^  feet,  was  built  at  a  cost  of  $2,150,000.  This 
lock  was  completed  and  opened  to  navigation  September  1,  1881.  June  9,  1881. 
the  canal  was  transferred  to  the  general  government  from  the  State.  This  work 
had  barely  been  completed  when  the  demands  of  commerce,  so  enormously 
increased,  compelled  further  improvements,  and  on  May  4,  1887,  work  was  begun 
on  another  new  lock,  now  nearly  completed,  on  the  site  of  the  old  State  locks. 
The  lock  now  in  operation  at  the  Soo  is  the  largest  in  the  world,  and  the  new 
one,  when  completed,  will  be  nearly  double  its  capacity.  The  lock  now  being 
constructed  will  have  a  length  of  800  feet  between  gates,  a  width  of  100  feet 
throughout,  a  depth  of  21  feet  of  water  on   the  miter  sills,  with  a  lift  of  183^

feet.  The  estimated  cost  of  this  canal  improvement  is  $4,738,865.  It  is  expected 
that  it  will  be  completed  and  ready  for  operation  in  1894.  The  following  com- 
parative statement  of  the  traffic  through  the  canal  for  the  years  1855  and  1892, 
will  give  an  idea  of  the  increase  and  development  of  lake  navigation  during  the 
past   thirty-seven   years: 

1855.  Registered  tonnage,  106,296 — coal,  tons,  1,414;  flour,  barrels,  10,287;  iron  ore, 
tons,   1,447. 

1892.  Registered  tonnage,  10,647,20.3— coal,  tons,  2,904,266;  flour,  barrels,  5,418,135; 
iron  ore,  tons,  4,901,132. 

Another  great  improvement  the  government  has  undertaken  at  this  point  is  the 
opening  of  Hay  Lake  channel,  shortening  the  distance  through  the  Ste.  Marie 
river  eleven  miles  and  making  it  possible  to  navigate  this  river  at  night,  a  con- 
dition impracticable  with  the  present  channel.  This  work  is  now  partially  com- 
pleted.   The  estimated   cost  of   this  improvement   is  $2,659,115. 

The  United  States  government  is  prosecuting  another  great  improvement  in  the 
city  of  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  now  nearly  completed,  that  of  rebuilding  and  enlarg- 
ing Fort  Brady,  at  a  cost  of  $250,000. 

The  International  railroad  bridge  here,  a  mile  in  length  and  costing  $1,000,000, 
was  completed  in  1888.  It  is  the  connecting  link  of  three  trunk  lines  of  railroad 
centering  here.  The  city  is  located  at  the  junction  of  the  three  great  lakes, 
Superior,  Michigan  and  Huron,  on  the  great  water  highway  between  the  east,  the 
west  and  the  northwest,  at  the  only  point  between  Duluth  and  Buffalo  where  it 
can  be  easily  bridged  for  railways.  Three  roads  are  built  and  other  great  trunk 
line^  are  centering  here,  which  makes  it  a  natural  distributing  point  and  gives 
it  every  advantage  of  rail  and  water  transportation,  insuring  cheap  freight  rates, 
both  for   raw   material   and  manufactured   product. 

The  city  when  the  United  States  census  was  taken  in  1890  had  a  population 
of  5,760,  which  is  steadily  increasing.  It  is  lighted  by  electricity,  has  a  fine  sys- 
tem of  water  works  and  sewers,  and  has  four  miles  of  electric  street  railway  in 
operation.  One-eighth  of  the  commerce  of  the  United  States  passes  through  the 
Soo  canal  and  locks.

GEOGRAPHICAL  AND  GEOLOGICAL  FEATURES 


BY    F.    S.    DEWEY,    ALPENA,   MICH. 


[  The  following  article  was  received  almost  too  late  for  insertion,  but  it  is  consid- 
ered too  valuable  to  omit.  The  work  was  retarded  by  articles  being  withheld, 
while  on  the  other  hand  the  early  issuance  of  the  work  was  urged.  This  will,  to 
8ome  extent,  explain  any  want  of  order  in  arrangement  of  subjects:] 

On  rowing  a  boat  close  to  the  beach  along  the  shore  of  Thunder  bay,  one  will  notice 
that  the  water  close  to  the  shore  is  much  deeper  than  it  is  a  few  rods  further  out. 
Still  beyond  is  another  deep  depression  and  then  again  another  shallow.  On  close 
observation  it  will  be  found  that  the  shallow  places  are  long  ridges  or  banks  of  sand 
under  the  water  running  parallel  with  the  shore.  The  constant  action  of  the  waves 
along  the  beach  digs  the  sand  away  and  the  undercurrent  carries  it  back  and  places  it 
in  these  long  parallel  ridges.  In  going  back  from  the  water  on  the  land  one  finds  great 
numbers  of  long  sand  ridges,  just  the  same  as  those  in  the  bottom  of  the  bay  and 
which  look  like  great  earthworks  thrown  up  by  some  ancient  army  in  its  gradual  and 
stubborn  retreat.  These  curious  lines  of  embankment  having  their  incipient  growth 
beneath  the  waters  of  the  lake  are  found  all  along  the  shore  of  the  bay  and  lake,  lying 
parallel  and  generally  only  a  few  rods  apart  and  extending  back  from  a  mile  to  ten 
miles,  and  in  some  cases  as  far  back  as  twenty  or  twenty  five  miles  from  the  shore. 
These  formations  are  very  marked  in  and  about  Alpena,  and  especially  between  Alpena 
and  Ossineke.  Two  or  three  miles  west  of  Alpena  we  find  them  crossing  the  road  at 
intervals  of  a  quarter  to  a  half  of  a  mile.  Beyond  or  west  of  each  of  these  ridges  is  a 
level  plane  or  terrace  just  a  few  feet  higher  than  its  succeeding  one  to  the  east. 
Finally,  nine  miles  west  of  Alpena,  the  State  road  comes  to  a  hill,  beyond  which  there 
are  no  more  of  these  old  lines  of  ancient  earthworks.  Along  the  foot  of  this  hill  or 
high  bluff  are  great  numbers  of  rounded  stones  or  boulders  all  plainly  worn  and 
smoothed  by  the  water  long  ages  ago.  Here  it  is  very  plain  to  see  was  once  the  shore 
of  Lake  Huron.  These  rounded  boulders  were  sorted  from  the  sand  and  pushed  up  in 
line  along  the  shore  by  the  ice  and  waves  many  thousand  years  ago.  Farther  to  the 
northwest,  along  the  shore  of  Presque  Isle  county,  the  work  of  the  terrace  epoch  is 
beautifully  illustrated,  and  particularly  as  one  approaches  Crawford's  quarry  from  the 
south  one  may  see  these  huge  terraces  developed  in  a  most  pronounced  manner. 
While  yet  a  mile  or  more  away  one  suddenly  comes  in  full  view  of  Lake  Huron,  the 
blue  waters  of  the  lake  appearing  to  rise  like  a  distant  bank  or  plain  to  blend  and  min- 
gle with  the  blue  sky  above.  While  standing  there  on  the  ancient  shore  where  the 
waters  of  Lake  Huron  beat  and  broke  for  ages,  one  sees  before  him  a  giant  stairway 
with  broad  steps  or  terraces  leading  down  to  the  lake.  Just  west  of  Crawford  quarry 
the  level  road  leads  along  one  of  these  broad  terraces.  A  hundred  and  eighty  feet 
above  and  in  plain  view  at  the  left  is  the  ancient  shore  from  which  a  great  stairway 
leads  abruptly  two  hundred  feet  down  to  the  present  water  level.  The  boy  with  his 
hand  sled  in  winter  may  leap  with  the  speed  of  an  arrow  over  the  history  of  a  hundred 
decades  of  centuries  in  much  less  than  a  hundred  seconds.  This  old  lake  shore  may 
be  plainly  traced  not  only  along  the  shores  of  Lake  Huron  and  Saginaw  bay,  but  along 
Lakes  Erie  and  St.  Clair  as  well.    Near  Denmark  junction,  southeast  of  Saginaw,  the 


Geographical  and  Geological.  203 

old  lake  shore  is  plainly  marked,  so  also  just  east  of  Yale,  at  Ridgway,  Utica  and  at 
Lenawee  Junction,  near  Adrian.  Between  these  several  points  and  the  present  shore 
may  be  plainly  seen  these  ancient  terraces  or  shore  lines. 

It  need  hardly  be  mentioned  that  when  the  lakes  stood  at  this  higher  level  they  were 
all  one  excepting,  of  course,  Lake  Ontario.  There  was  no  Niagara  river  then  and  only 
Lake  Ontario  went  down  the  St.  Lawrence  to  the  sea.  All  the  rest  had  an  outlet  of 
their  own  down  through  Illinois  and  the  Mississippi.  Indeed  much  of  the  great 
prairies  of  Illinois  were  then  the  bottom  of  Lake  Michigan.  Once  ages  upon  ages 
before  there  had  been  another  Niagara  gorge,  much  of  its  course  lying  to  the  west  of 
the  Niagara  of  today.  For  untold  centuries  the  old  river  had  flowed  and  worn  a  deep 
channel  down  through  the  rocks  and  another  old  Niagara  falls  had  shaken  the  earth 
with  its  thunder. 

For  some  reason  perhaps  not  yet  fully  understood  there  came  about  a  remarkable 
«hange  in  climatic  conditions,  but  whatever  the  cause  may  have  been  the  result  was 
that  the  northern  part  of  North  America  and  of  the  old  world  as  well  became  covered 
to  a  very  great  depth  with  ice  and  snow.  Great  glaciers  were  thus  formed  of  very 
wide  extent,  at  some  period  of  their  existence,  in  all  probability,  being  as  wide  as  the 
•continent  itself.  This  vast  sheet  of  ice  and  snow  swept  slowly  and  with  irresistible 
force  in  a  direction  generally  southward,  bearing  before  it  and  within  its  mass  and 
along  its  under  surface  immense  accumulations  of  debris,  rocks,  gravel,  sand  and  mud, 
which,  between  the  upper  and  the  nether  millstone  of  nature,  were  ground  up  and 
•comminuted  and  prepared  for  tillable  land.  The  same  thing  is  going  on  in  Greenland 
today,  where  the  vast  fields  of  ice  sweep  slowly  over  the  surface  of  the  land,  push  their 
margins  gradually  out  into  the  ocean  and  finally  as  huge  icebergs  break  off  and  float 
away.  Ln  the  mountainous  regions  of  Switzerland  as  well  as  in  Alaska  these  glaciers 
are  continuing  their  work. 

How  long  this  reign  of  ice  continued  is  a  matter  of  conjecture,  but  it  is  pretty  cer- 
tain that  its  history  covered  a  vastly  greater  period  than  does  the  history  of  man. 
During  all  these  thousands  of  years  it  carried  on  its  work  of  breaking  off  huge  frag- 
ments of  rocks  far  to  the  north,  grinding  them  up  into  rounded  boulders,  gravel,  sand 
and  clay  and  preparing  them  for  the  advent  of  civilized  man.  This  immense  sheet  of 
ice  extended  certainly  as  far  south  as  the  Ohio  river  and  perhaps  at  times  very  much 
farther.  Then  slowly  year  after  year  its  southern  margin  began  melting  away.  Some- 
times its  great  nose  full  of  sand  and  mud  melted  off  just  as  fast  as  it  pushed  south- 
ward, thus  forming  a  great  bank  of  earth  before  it.  These  banks  are  the  hills  and 
knolls  of  our  beautiful  peninsula.  As  the  springtime  gradually  dawned  nothing  was 
left  of  this  ice  field  about  Michigan  except  great  tongues  of  ice  several  hundred  miles 
in  length  pushing  out  of  the  cold  north,  one  from  the  northeast  along  the  bed  of  Lake 
Erie;  one  from  the  northwest,  bending  to  the  south  down  Lake  Huron;  a  third  coming 
straight  down  through  the  valley  of  Lake  Michigan;  while  a  fourth  swept  westward 
along  the  region  occupied  by  Lake  Superior.  It  is  perhaps  needless  to  add  that  these 
great  inland  seas  were  for  the  time  being  entirely  swept  out  of  existence,  their  beds 
being  more  than  filled  by  these  vast  sweeping  fields  of  ice.  The  glacier  that  plowed 
down  through  the  bed  of  Lake  Huron  crowded  up  a  somewhat  irregular  furrow  on  its 
western  margin,  a  sort  of  lateral  moraine  which  extends  from  about  the  middle  of 
Alpena  county  southward  more  than  fifty  miles.  It  presents  an  almost  unbroken  line 
of  hills  from  two  hundred  to  three  hundred  feet  above  the  level  of  Lake  Huron,  in 
some  places  presenting  sides  as  steep  as  it  is  possible  for  the  soil  to  lie. 

Centuries  after  this  a  second  furrow  or  moraine  was  formed,  beginning  between 
Devil  lake  and  Hubbard  river  in  Alpena  county  and  extending  generally  parallel  with 
the  first,  but  in  much  more  broken  hills  of  varying  heights.  The  lofty  table  land  back 
of  Ossineke  rising  to  a  height  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  feet,  is  a  portion  of  this  last 
moraine. 

Of  course  the  edges  of  this  glacier  were  somewhat  irregular  and  this  was 
especially  the  case  with  its  anterior  margin,  in  consequence  of  which  the  earth 
which  it  transported  was  deposited  in  irregular  heaps  and  banks  and  lines.  It 
trickled  and  tumbled  down  out  of  the  lofty,  melting,  jagged  sides  and  prow  of 
this  ice  plateau  and  was  often  nicely  assorted  by  ttie  creeks  and  rivulets  thus 
formed  from  the  melting  ice  into  plainly  distinguishable  layers  of  sand  and 
gravel  and  clay.  These  layers  are  found  lying  at  every  angle  of  elevation  and 
in  every  corrugated  form,  wherever  excavations  are  made  through  our  hills  for 
railroad  or  .  other  purposes.  Even  ripple  marks  and  little  gravel  beds  show 
plainly  where  flowed  out  of  the  melting  mass  some  turbid,  rushing  stream.  In 
this  manner  were  formed  all  the  hills  in  Michigan  south  of  Mackinaw,  as  well 
as  the  round   tops   and   high  ridges  of   Ohio   and   Indiana.      Many  of    these   hills 


204  Michigan  and  its  Kesoukces. 

attain  almost  to  the  dignity  of  mountains,  but  differ  from  them  in  one  very- 
important  particular,  which  is  that  they  are  composed  entirely  of  earth  trans- 
ported from  the  north  by  glacial  action.  None  of  them  are  built  up  of  solid 
rocks  elevated  by  some  subterranean  forces,  as  are  all  true  mountains.  While 
rocks,  to  be  sure,  underlie  all  of  the  southern  peninsula  of  Michigan  in  super- 
imposed, almost  horizontal  layers,  still  they  are  hidden  from  view  except  in 
comparatively  few  localities  by  the  earth^ — or  drift,  as  it  is  called — transported 
here  by  the  glaciers.  This  drift  is  of  wonderfully  varying  thickness.  In  the- 
eastern  part  of  Alpena  county  there  are  hundreds  of  acres  with  not  enough 
drift  covering  the  ledge  rocks  to  make  a  garden,  while  west  of  the  old  shore 
line  of  the  lake  the  thickness  of  the  drift  reaches  from  one  hundred  to  three 
hundred  feet,  while  in  some  portions  of  the  State  it  reaches  a  depth  of  at  least 
six  hundred  feet.  It  may  not  be  generally  understood  how  much  of  the  beau- 
tiful and  lovely  scenery  of  Michigan  is  due  to  the  action  of  these  ancient 
glaciers.  Their  deeply  serrated  southern  margins  melting  slowly  or  rapidly  as- 
the  sun  traveled  high  or  low  in  the  heavens,  or,  as  the  glacier  moved  more  rapidly 
or  slowly,  left  irregular  and  huge  piles  of  drifts  as  are  plainly  observable  about 
Ann  Arbor  and  Hillsdale.  Prospect  Hill  in  Lenawee  county  reaches  a  height 
of  six  hundred  feet  above  the  general  level,  while  Bundy's  hills,  farther  to  the 
west,  are  almost  as  high.  These  are  fine  examples  of  irregular  terminal  moraines. 
Nearly  all  of  the  thousand  beautiful  little  lakes  which  add  so  much  charm  to 
the  landscape  simply  occupy  the  hollows  consequent  on  the  irregular  melting  of 
the  glaciers. 

As  would  be  natural  to  suppose,  the  underlying  rock  upon  which  these  glaciers- 
plowed  and  scraped  their  way  southward  show  unmistakable  evidence  of  the  tremen- 
dous power  of  this  moving  sheet  of  ice.  Wherever  by  excavation  the  rocks  are  exposed 
to  view,  they  are  found  scraped,  planed  and  polished  almost  as  smooth  as  a  marble 
table.  The  strice  or  lines  and  furrows  made  by  the  scraping  of  the  pebbles  and  bould- 
ers m  the  bottom  of  the  glacier  over  the  softer  underlying  rocks  clearly  point  out  the 
direction  which  the  glaciers  traveled.  At  Alpena  they  show  the  direction  of  the  gla- 
cier to  be  southeast  by  east.  In  many  places  throughout  Alpena  county  these  glacial 
markings  are  beautifully  exhibited.  The  Lockwood  school  in  Alpena  has  more  than 
twenty  blocks  of  stone  in  its  foundation  cut  by  the  chisel  of  this  ancient  artisan. 
Some  of  the  boulders  transported  from  Canada  down  into  Michigan  are  of  remarkable 
size,  the  measurement  of  several  in  the  eastern  part  of  Alpena  county  indicating  a 
weight  of  more  than  a  hundred  thousand  pounds.  One  of  them,  perhaps  the  largest,  is 
a  jasper  conglomerate  or  pudding  stone,  closely  similar  to  the  class  rock  placed  on  the 
university  campus  by  the  class  of  1862.  It  is,  however,  many  times  larger.  Perhapa 
no  finer  specimen  can  be  found  in  the  State  illustrating  both  the  transported  boulder 
and  the  action  of  the  glacier,  than  the  great  black  mass  lying  close  by  the  Michigan 
Central  railway  station  at  Battle  Creek.  This  was  evidently  transported  from  near 
Lake  Superior  and  borne  in  the  bottom  of  the  glacier,  as  is  evidenced  from  it» 
polished  surface,  its  glacial  markings  and  flattened  form. 

As  one  contemplates  the  work  performed  by  the  ancient  glaciers  in  and  about 
Michigan,  it  seems  almost  impossible  to  fail  to  recognize  a  purpose  in  it  all.  The 
material  ground  up  and  transported  by  them  and  spread  out  over  the  hitherto  almost 
barren  rocks  constitute  a  factor  of  the  very  highest  importance.  The  scanty  soil 
thinly  sprinkled  over  the  almost  barren  rocks  would  have  given  a  very  meager  response 
to  the  labors  of  the  husbandman.  To  them  he  is  indebted  for  all  the  material  out  of 
which  he  has  made  the  beautiful  farms  of  Michigan,  while  the  hard  heads  or  boulder* 
so  extremely  abundant  everywhere  throughout  the  State  undoubtedly  have  a  purpose 
besides  that  of  a  building  material,  but  somehow  heretofore  a  very  shortsighted  policy 
seems  to  have  blinded  the  people's  eyes  to  its  value.  To  be  sure  they  have  for  many 
years  been  extensively  employed  to  make  the  most  abominable  street  pavement  that 
ever  tortured  the  living  or  jostled  the  dead,  but  their  value  for  roads  and  highways^ 
when  crushed  into  fragments,  seems  to  have  been  very  tardily  appreciated. 

As  has  just  been  stated,  underlying  the  whole  of  Michigan  south  of  Mack- 
inaw are  layers  upon  layers  of  different  kinds  of  rock  which  was  once  sedi- 
ment or  mud  deposited  in  the  bottom  of  the  ocean.  These  sedimentary  rocka 
are  of  varying  thickness  and  in  the  central  portion  of  the  State  reach  a  depth 
of  many  thousand  feet.  Underneath  them  all  lies  the  granite,  the  universal 
foundation  of  all  sedimentary  rock.  These  strata  of  sedimentary  rock  lie  one 
upon  the  other  like  a  pile  of  very  flat  plate  with  the  center  in  Gratiot  county. 
The  top  one  or  the  last  and  smallest  of  all  was  formed  at  the  very  beginnings 
of  the  coal  period  and  is  perhaps  a  hundred  and  fifty  miles  across.    Its  south- 


Geographical  and  Geological.  205 


ern  margin  is  close  by  the  city  of  Jackson,  while  its  northern  extremity  is  a 
few  miles  north  of  the  western  end  of  Saginaw  bay.  All  the  coal  of  Michigan 
is  found  in  that  stratum.  Any  attempt  to  search  for  coal  outside  the  limits  here 
indicated  would  therefore  be  a  waste  of  time  and  capital.  Fragments  and  per- 
haps sometimes  considerable  masses  of  coal  might  be  found  in  the  extreme 
southern  portion  of  the  State,  but  its  existence  there  is  easily  accounted  for 
by  the  action  of  the  glaciers.  Small  masses  of  copper  and  iron  are  also  frequently 
found  scattered  over  the  surface  of  the  southern  peninsula,  but  it  would  be 
utterly  useless  to  search  for  them  anywhere  south  of  Mackinaw.  Each  success- 
ive underlying  plate  or  stratum  of  rock  is  larger  and  its  edges  crop  out  all 
around  the  edges  of  the  smaller  plate,  except  some  of  the  lower  ones,  which  dip 
down  under  the  states  of  Indiana  and  Ohio.  Long  before  the  glacier  epoch 
when  Michigan  was  a  gulf  of  the  sea  almost  surrounded  by  land  and  as  the 
sea  retreated  it  left  salt  or  brine  in  these  plates  or  basins.  In  Saginaw  brine 
is  obtained  from  one  of  these  basins  and  at  Tawas  from  another  and  a  lower 
one,  while  at  Alpena  at  a  depth  of  about  1,250  feet  we  strike  a  very  thick  bed 
of  pure,  solid  rock  salt.  This  is  in  a  still  lower  basin  and  can  be  obtained  only 
by  letting  in  water  from  above  and  pumping  it  out  as  brine.  The  most  of 
these  sedimentary  rocks  are  limestone,  while  some  are  shale,  like  that  at  Sul- 
phur island  in  Thunder  bay.  There  are  strata  of  sandstone  as  at  Ionia,  where 
is  found  a  beautiful  mottled  stratum  colored  with  iron.  This  is  a  most  elegant 
stone  for  building  purposes  and  is  the  more  valuable  because  of  the  ease  with 
which  it  is  cut.  Another  stratum  crops  out  at  Napoleon  and  Stony  Point  and 
would  also  if  properly  worked  be  found  very  valuable  for  building  purposes. 
There  is  also  a  peculiar  sandstone  cropping  out  near  Marshall  which  is  very 
full  of  fresh  water  mussels,  showing  its  origin  to  have  been  la  custrine.  Much 
of  the  limestone  rock  is  literally  full  of  the  remains  of  animal  life  and  there 
is  one  stratum  at  least  of  considerable  thickness  cropping  out  near  Alpena  that 
is  composed  almost  entirely  of  marine  shells.  The  oil  of  these  animals  is  much 
of  it  still  stored  up  in  the  rocks,  and  if  there  was  only  an  impervious  covering 
to  keep  the  oil  from  escaping  then  we  might  in  many  localities  obtain  petro- 
leum in  large  quantities  and  of  the  best  quality.  It  oozes  out  of  the  ground 
in  many  places  in  Alpena  county  and  at  Alpena,  while  boring  through  the 
lower  Devonian  rocks,  a  very  fine  quality  of  oil  was  struck  at  a  depth  of  1,200 
feet.  In  this  region  the  rocks  are  all  broken  into  fragments  by  the  ancient 
earthquakes,  so  that  water  flows  freely  through  them  and  forces  the  oil  and 
gas  out  apparently  as  fast  as  it  is  distilled.  In  many  places  the  surface  water 
drops  into  holes  and  crevasses  in  the  rocks,  thus  forming  underground  currents 
or  streams.  This  is  emphatically  true  of  the  western  part  of  Presque  Isle 
county  and  the  northern  half  of  Alpena.  If,  therefore,  wells  are  bored  anywhere 
along  the  shore  southeast  of  these*  localities  the  drill  would  almost  surely  strike 
some  of  these  crevices  in  the  rocks  and  the  water  would  come  up  to  the  surface. 
If  the  casing  pipe  is  extended  upward  the  water  will  still  rise  in  it  from  thirty 
to  seventy  feet.  In  the  city  of  Alpena  are  eight  of  these  flowing  wells,  yield- 
ing not  less  than  five  million  gallons  daily.  Five  of  them  are  only  five  or  six 
hundred  feet  in  depth,  while  two  others  about  1,300  feet  deep  yielded  a  very 
excellent  mineral  water  which  is  very  strongly  impregnated  with  sulphur  gas. 
This  gas  in  the  water  has  power  to  dissolve  the  limestone  rock  and  constantly 
increase  the  size  of  the  underground  passages.  In  the  region  above  named  are 
a  large  number  of  remarkable  illustrations  of  the  corroding  effect  of  this  gas. 
Immense  caverns  have  been  formed  down  deep  in  the  rocks,  thus  leaving  an 
unsupported  dome,  which  in  hundreds  of  cases  has  dropped  down  into  the  sub- 
terran^n    cavern. 

The  gradual  dissolving  and  wearing  away  of  the  fallen  debris  has  left  wells 
or  pits  of  horrid  depth  and  prodigious  size,  the  existence  of  which  very  few 
people  have  any  knowledge.  In  the  northern  part  of  Alpena  county  in  the 
township  of  Long  Rapids  are  some  remarkable  specimens  of  these  giant  wells. 
In  one  forty  acre  lot  are  five  of  these  deep  pits  which  are  substantial  types  of 
all   the   rest. 

They  are  in  the  midst  of  a  grand  old  forest  scarcely  touched  as  yet  by  the 
hand  of  man,  and  so  dense  is  it  that  one  finds  himself  without  any  warning 
right  on  the  very  brink  of  the  yawning  abyss.  The  first  at  which  one  arrives 
is  the  type  of  all  the  rest  throughout  this  region.  It  is  partly  full  of  water. 
how  deep  has  not  been  determined,  but  it  is  a  hundred  and  sixty  feet  from 
its  ferned   and  flowered  rim   to  the  liquid   mirror   below,  and  across  the  top  from 


206  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

rim  to  rim  is  about  two  hundred  and  fifty  feet.  The  walls  are  perpendicular 
solid  rock  and  grey  dolomite  Hamilton  limestone  with  patches  of  moss,  and  here 
and  there  a  lichen  or  a  trailing  vine  clinging  to  the  seams  and  crevices  of  the 
dark  old  walls.  Twenty-five  years  ago  a  large  tall  white  pine  stood  leaning  eo 
far  out  over  the  rim  that  it  could  not  have  been  saved.  When  it  was  cut  it 
swept  over,  down,  and  shot  like  a  javelin  head  first  into  the  water  below  and 
entirely  disappeared  from  sight.  It  soon  rose  to  the  surface  stripped  of  its 
branches,  where  it  still  remains  floating  in  undisturbed  tranquility.  While  many 
of  these  wells  are  partly  filled  with  water  at  all  seaeons  of  the  year,  there  are 
many  others  which  are  always  dry  and  still  others  which  are  filled  during  times 
of  freshet.  Many  of  them  receive  brooks  and  creeks  which  plunge  down  in 
beautiful   cascades  and  disappear  among  the  jagged  rocks  at  the  bottom. 

In  the  southern  part  of  Presque  Isle  county  is  one  of  these  pits  which  is 
worthy  of  more  than  a  passing  notice.  While  approaching  by  the  main  traveled 
road  which  leads  close  past  the  western  margin,  one  is  attracted  by  the  sound 
of  rushing  waters  long  before  arriving  in  sight  of  the  pit.  Leading  down  to  it 
from  the  east  is  a  long,  narrow,  rocky  ravine  more  than  a  mile  in  length  and 
perhaps  an  eighth  of  a  mile  wide,  gradually  deepening  till  at  the  western 
extremity  it  reaches  a  depth  of  at  least  150  feet.  This  extremity  is  one  of  those 
giant  wells  like  the  ones  before  described.  The  general  contour  of  this  ravine 
is  closely  similar  to  the  prostrate  form  of  a  man,  the  feet  slanting  upward  to 
the  east.  Besides  the  well  which  represents  the  head,  there  is  another  at  the 
shoulders,  the  two  being  joined  together  by  a  narrow  channel  which  represents 
the  neck.  The  north  branch  of  Thunder  bay  river,  sweeping  around  from  the 
northwest,  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  streams  in  Michigan  and  millions  of 
feet  of  forest  timber  are  floated  down  its  channel  every  year.  It  is  a  river 
about  the  size  of  the  Huron  at  Ann  Arbor  and  furnishes  all  the  year  round 
reliable  water  power  for  a  good  size  saw-mill  and  also  a  grist-mill  side  by  side, 
after  passing  which  all  its  waters  are  poured  into  this  ravine.  The  entrance  is 
at  the  upper  or  easterly  end,  and  the  river  comes  rushing  and  foaming  down 
along  the  rugged,  rocky  channel  to  the  shoulders  and  through  the  neck  into  the 
head.  Here  in  a  great  eddying  whirlpool  250  feet  across  it  sweeps  round  and 
round  and  is  all  swallowed  up  in  this  bottomless  pit.  During  the  freshets  of  the 
spring  and  autumn  this  ravine  generally  fills  up  with  water,  making  a  lake 
more  than  a  mile  in  length  and  150  feet  in  depth.  The  river  then  flows  on 
over  its  hitherto  dry  bed  beyond,  not  only  undiminished  in  volume  but,  on  the 
contrary,  largely  augmented  by  great  volumes  of  water  boiling  up  from  the 
same  subterranean  caverns  that  had  formerly  swallowed  it  down.  All  logs,  drift- 
wood and  debris  which  have  accumulated  at  the  head  are  now  swept  by  the 
force  of  the  current  out  at  the  feet.  This  wonderful  curiosity  is  popularly 
known  as  sunken  lake. 

The  number  of  these  giant  wells  in  the  region  of  Alpena  county  reaches  close  ta 
three  hundred.  Most  of  them  are  very  large  and  deep,  with  perpendicular  lime- 
stone walls,  and,  of  course,  cannot  be  explored  without  the  aid  of  a  pulley  and 
line.  Some  are  churn  shaped,  increasing  in  size  downward,  and  it  is  more  than 
probable  that  careful  exploration  would  reveal  very  interesting  subterranean  pas- 
sage-ways. Indeed,  the  finding  of  large  caves  in  rocks  so  full  of  fissures  capable  of 
swallowing  up  a  large  river,  together  with  hundreds  of  creeks  and  smaller  streams, 
could  scarcely  be  a  matter  of  surprise.  Many  of  them  bear  the  most  undoubted 
evidence  of  having  been  very  recently  formed  and  one,  on  the  line  of  the  Au  Sable 
and  Northwestern  railroad,  was  certainly  formed  in  a  single  night.  It  is  related  by 
the  foreman  of  the  construction  that  a  section  of  the  road,  all  finished  and  ready 
for  trains,  dropped  out  of  sight  and  there  was  left  what  appeared  to  be  a  bottom- 
less pit  filled  with  water  which  no  amount  of  filling  seemed  to  affect.  It  became 
necessary  to  change  the  line  and  pass  around.  Most  of  these  pits  seem  to  belong- 
to  a  series  which  lie  in  a  general  line  extending  from  Misery  bay,  five  miles  east 
of  Alpena,  to  town  34-1,  perhaps  sixty  miles  northwest.  They  undoubtedly  approx- 
imately indicate  the  course  of  the  subterranean  river.  The  fact  that  many  of  them 
are  partly  filled  with  water  during  times  of  freshet,  together  with  great  numbers  of 
fish  of  considerable  size,  would  certainly  indicate  some  such  subterranean  connec- 
tion. In  one  of  these  wells  far  to  the  northwest  we  learn,  from  the  very  highest 
authority,  that  a  large  number  of  fish,  no  less  than  twenty  barrels,  were  left 
struggling  in  the  bottom  of  the  well  unable  to  find  their  way  out  as  the  water 
sank  away  and  left  them.  Near  the  head  of  Long  lake  is  one  from  which  con- 
siderable quantities  of  fish    have  been  taken  and    trapped  in  small  pools  where 


Geographical  and  Geological.  207 

the  receding  water  had  left  them.  As  there  are  no  surface  streams  whatever  to 
either  of  these  pits  just  named,  they  furnish  the  most  positive  proof  of  the 
existence  of  an  underground  river.  Not  only  have  we  the  proof  of  its  existence, 
but  its  very  course  may  be  traced  with  a  considerable  degree  of  accuracy.  Start- 
ing at  the  prime  meridian  in  the  middle  of  the  west  boundary  of  Presque  Isle 
county,  it  takes  a  southeasterly  course  down  into  the  township  of  Long  Rapids 
in  Alpena  county,  thence  northeast  across  Maple  ridge  to  Long  lake,  thence 
bending  to  the  southeast  and  continuing  along  near  the  shore  of  this  lake  it  flows 
in  nearly  a  straight  line  to  the  southeast  till  it  terminates  in  Misery  bay.  Just 
southeast  of  Long  lake  there  is  an  extensive  deep  synclinal  depression  in  the 
rocks,  undoubtedly  due  to  the  river  wearing  away  the  supporting  rocks  below. 
This  depression,  known  as  the  Narrows,  is  usually  a  lake  a  mile  in  length  and 
sixty  feet  or  more  in  depth  and  emptying  by  a  large  stream  into  Lake  Huron. 
The  outlet  of  Long  lake  passes  through  it,  but  in  very  dry  weather  all  the  water 
in  this  basin  leaks  out  through  the  crevices  in  the  clean,  bare  rock  strata  at 
the  bottom,  leaving  only  a  small   pool    in  one  of  these  deep  wells. 

Misery  bay,  where  this  subterranean  river  empties,  is  really  a  small,  shallow, 
inland  lake  of  about  two  hundred  acres  in  area,  connected  with  Lake  Huron  by 
a  narrow  entrance,  sometimes  too  shallow  for  even  a  fish  boat  to  enter.  Its 
western  extremity  is  bounded  by  high  bluffs,  at  the  margin  of  which  the  ledges  of 
rocks  have  pitctied  downward  toward  the  water,  leaving  a  rugged  rim  and  a  deep 
rift  in  the  rocks  one-half  mile  long  and  ten  to  twenty  feet  deep.  The  archasolo- 
gist  who  will  squeeze  his  way  along  this  narrow  rift  will  find  between  the  strata 
a  rich  harvest  of  very  perfect  devonian  fossils.  In  fact  the  whole  State  of  Mich- 
igan does  not  afford  another  field  that  can  compare  with  the  Thunder  bay  region 
in  the  extent,  variety  and  perfection  of  its  fossil  remains.  In  the  bottom  of  this 
little  bay  are  three  of  these  giant  wells,  one  of  them  larger  and  deeper  than  any 
heretofore  noted.  This  is  the  one  which  constitutes  the  mouth  of  the  underground 
river.  In  summer  the  water  boiling  up  from  this  immense  pit  is  cold  as  spring 
water,  while  in  the  coldest  winters  ice  never  forms  on  the  surface,  but  a  broad 
open  river  leads  out  through  the  narrow  channel  into  the  open  lake.  Even  when 
the  thermometer  is  far  below  zero  and  the  ice  outside  along  the  shore  is  from 
two  to  three  feet  thick,  flocks  of  wild  ducks  find  this  secluded  spot  an  inviting- 
place  to  spend  the  entire  winter.  A  strange  peculiarity  of  this  subterranean  river 
is  its  intermittent  flow.  Every  twenty  minutes  an  immense  volume  of  water  pours 
out  from  down  below  filling  the  little  bay  to  a  height  of  eight  inches  above 
the  ordinary  level,  thus  causing  the  water  to  rush  out  through  the  narrow  open- 
ing into  Lake  Huron,  and  then  for  twenty  minutes  it  rests  again  and  the  tide- 
goes  down,  and  thus  the  rising  and  the  falling  of  the  tide  goes  on  as  if  from 
the  mighty  pulsations  of  some  great  heart  down  in   the  bosom  of  the  earth. 

Aside  from  the  curious  phenomena  connected  with  the  subterranean  river  here 
lies  hidden,  only  five  miles  from  the  busy  city  of  Alpena,  the  most  secluded,  the 
most  charming  spot  on  the  whole  west  shore  of  Lake  Huron.  Several  large  springs 
boil  up  from  the  bottom  of  the  bay,  it  is  full  of  fish  and  in  season  fairly  swarm- 
ing with  wild  water  fowl,  many  of  which  fondly  tarry  through  the  entire  long 
winter.  Out  beyond  this  little  inland  lake  is  Little  Thunder  bay,  of  a  thousand 
acres  or  more,  fairly  separated  and  protected  from  the  open  lake  by  the  long, 
slender  arm  of  Misery  point,  together  with  Round  island  and  Crooked  island,  both 
these  islands  being  very  safe  and  delightfully  charming  camping  grounds  for  the 
seeker  after  health,  rest  and  recreation. 

The  question  is  very  frequently  asked  what  valuable  minerals  may  we  hope  to  find 
in  the  rocks  of  the  southern  peninsula.  No  doubt  the  reader  has  already  learned 
enough  of  their  character  to  enable  him  to  answer  this  question  for  himself.  The 
character  of  the  rocks  plainly  indicates  that  at  several  different  times  in  the  early  his- 
tory of  the  globe  the  ocean  covered  the  entire  peninsula,  and  we  further  learn  that 
most  of  these  rocks  are  simply  sedimentary  deposits  laid  down  as  mud  or  sand  in  the 
bottom  of  this  ancient  sea.  It  would  be  quite  unreasonable  to  presume  that  any 
considerable  quantity  of  gold  or  silver,  copper  or  iron,  should  ever  have  been  float- 
ing around  in  the  warm  water  of  the  old  steamy  ocean.  These  metals  are  never 
deposited  in  the  mud  or  slimy  ooze  of  the  ocean's  bed,  and  to  search  for  them 
there  would  be  the  height  of  folly.  It  is  true  indeed  that  nuggets  of  copper 
and  masses  of  iron  have  been  often  found  in  all  parts  of  the  southern  penin- 
sula and  even  in  Ohio  and  Indiana,  but  having  been  brought  down  from  the 
Lake  Superior   country    by    the    force    of    the    ancient    glaciers,    they    possess    no 


208  Michigan  and  its  Eesoueces. 

special  significance.  They  have  found  their  way  there  in  the  same  manner  as 
have  the  boulders  and  hard  heads  heretofore   described. 

While  this  peninsula  has  none  of  the  metals  referred  to,  it  possesses  a  most 
extraordinary  wealth  in  its  mines  of  coal,  its  inexhaustible  salt  wells,  its  exten- 
sive and  numerous  stone  quarries  and  alabaster  beds,  the  remarkable  variety  and 
immense  extent  of  its  forest  products,  the  charming  beauty  of  its  numberless 
crystal  lakes  and  rivers,  all  peopled  with  swarms  of  fish,  and  wild  fowl  in  almost 
endless  variety;  and,  added  to  these,  a  depth  and  fertility  and  variety  of  soil 
which  never  for  a  single  season  fails  to  respond  by  abundant  harvests  to  the 
labors  of  the  husbandman.  It  seems  no  wonder  that  nature,  casting  about  it 
her  great  protecting  arms  of  Lakes  Huron  and  Michigan,  should  hold  it  like  a 
precious  jewel  in  her  fond  embrace,  cooling  and  moistening  the  heated  air  of 
summer  and  adding  warmth  and  humidity  to  the  cold  blasts  of  winter.  The 
intelligent  foreigner  contemplating  removal  from  his  fatherland  casts  his  eye 
across  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  checkered  map  of  our  country  and  finally, 
instinctively  placing  his  finger  on  the  picture  of  that  beautiful  spot  of  earth 
which  is  laved  and  kissed  on  all  sides  by  those  great  inland  seas,  exclaims  to 
himself:  "There  will  I  make  my  home."  In  like  manner  from  many  a  thank- 
less hillside  and  narrow  vale  in  New  England  the  weary  husbandman  has  turned 
his  footsteps  toward  the  setting  sun  and  found  himself  a  happy  home  between 
those  great  warm  arms.  It  is  perhaps  to  this  class  of  people,  quite  as  much 
as  to  any  other,  that  we  are  indebted  for  the  intelligence,  the  energy,  the 
versatility  and  prosperity  of  our  people.  It  is  fortunate  indeed  that  where 
nature  has  placed  her  richest  storehouses  she  has  directed  the  steps  of  a  people 
worthy  of  her  treasures.  In  variety  and  extent  of  production  her  forests  sur- 
pass any  other  state.  In  salt  she  takes  the  lead.  In  copper  and  iron  she  stands 
at  the  head  and  one  almost  wonders  if  the  finger  of  the  prophet  was  not 
pointed  toward  the  Occident  when  he  spoke  of  that  "  land  whose  stones  are 
iron  and  out  of  whose  hills  thou  mayest  dig  brass." 

Its  extensive  gardens  of  berries  and  vegetables,  of  celery  and  peppermint,  its 
wide  stretches  of  beautiful  farms  every  year  yielding  a  bountiful  harvest,  all  chal- 
lenge the  admiration  of  every  traveler  across  our  State,  while  its  vast  orchards  of 
peaches  stretched  along  the  shores  of  Lake  Michigan  stand  without  a  rival  in  the 
world.  In  the  northeastern  quarter,  especially  in  Alpena  county,  are  great  plum 
orchards,  some  of  them  containing  many  thousands  of  trees,  whose  fruit  is  abso- 
lutely without  blemish  and  in  every  respect  of  the  very  highest  possible  degree  of 
perfection.  Even  at  Mackinac  island,  that  gem  of  the  northern  lakes,  this  fruit 
grows  in  abundance,  and  no  exhibit  in  wax  ever  showed  fewer  imperfections.  It 
would  seem  that  nothing  could  prevent  this  northeast  quarter  of  the  State  from 
becoming  in  the  near  future  one  vast  orchard  of  plums  and  apples  and  pears. 
Perhaps  when  the  feast  has  been  spread  for  years  the  enemy  may  find  it  out,  but 
as  yet  he  has  not  come  and  the  experimental  stage  has  long  been  passed.  Besides 
sufficient  for  home  consumption,  large  quantities  are  shipped  for  other  markets 
every  year,  while  the  demand,  like  that  for  the  potatoes  of  this  northern  region, 
refuses  to  be  satisfied.  Let  the  speculative  genius  figure  out  if  he  can  how  a  hun- 
dred acres  of  land  can  be  made  to  yield  more  round  dollars  with  less  hard  labor 
than  when  planted  to  plums  in  a  region  where  the  tree  and  its  fruit  attain  per- 
fection and  the  curculio  has  not  come.  Let  him  who  contemplates  putting  a  little 
fortune  into  a  pile  of  brick  and  mortar  in  the  form  of  a  great  bleak  mansion  stop 
and  consider  what  pleasure,  what  infinite  delight  may  be  his  portion  in  his  declin- 
ing years  if  in  close  communion  with  a  great  orchard  yearly  loaded  with  sweet  and 
tempting  smiles  of  nature;  and  let  him  whose  vague  unrest  might  tempt  him  to

MICHIGAN   BY  COUNTIES. 


To  obtain  reliable  sketches  of  each  county,  the  members  of  the  legislature 
were  requested  to  designate  some  suitable  person  resident  of  each  county  to  write 
it  up.  To  secure  uniformity  in  the  matter  the  sketch  published  in  the  issue  of 
1873  was  mailed  to  the  person  so  designated,  together  with  a  circular  letter  out 
lining  the  matter  to  be  mentioned.  In  part  of  the  counties  this  was  well  done; 
other  persons  did  not  respond  and  the  compiler  was  forced  to  gather  such  facts 
as  he  could  find. 

There  are  few  counties  but  have  some  local  advantages  not  generally  known 
which   could  be  properly  set   forth   but   which  are   necessarily   left   out. 

There  are  numerous  locations  in  the  State  with  superior  advantages  for  certain 
kinds  of  manufacturing  and  said  locations  want  the  factories,  while  on  the  other 
hand  there  is  capital  seeking  such  places,  neither  knowing  of  the  other;  with  a 
bare  knowledge  of  facts  both  might  be  benefited.  This  was  one  of  the  objects  of 
this  work. 

Neglecting  to  improve  an  opportunity  of  this  kind  is  "hiding  a  light  under  a 
bushel,*'  and  those  who  would  be  benefited  by  the  act  are  the  losers  by  the 
neglect.  Neglecting  opportunities  cripples  enterprise.  The  press  has  been  a  great 
factor  in  the  advancement  of  the  State.  Adverse  criticism  and  erroneous  state- 
ments made  in  the  early  history  of  the  State  or  territory  had  much  to  do  with 
stagnating  State  progress.  Immediately  after  the  war  of  1812  an  act  passed  con- 
gress giving  each  soldier  a  bounty  of  160  acres  of  land,  2,000,000  acres  to  be 
located  in  Michigan.  An  examination  was  made  into  the  quality  of  the  land  and 
in  a  report  made  by  Edward  Tiffin,  Surveyor  General,  to  Josiah  Meigs,  Com- 
missioner General  Land  Office,  November  30,  1815,  he  said  the  land  was  all  either 
swamp  or  barren,  sandy  land  on  which  nothing  would  grow.  In  finishing  the 
report  he  said:  "Taking  the  country  altogether  so  far  as  has  been  explored  and 
to  all  appearances,  together  with  information  received  concurring,  the  balance  is 
as  bad;  there  would  not  be  more  than  one  acre  out  of  a  hundred,  if  there  would 
be  one  out  of  a  thousand,  that  would  in  any  case  admit  of  cultivation." 

On  February  6.  1816,  the  following  message  was  issued  by  the  president: 

"To  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of  the  United  States: 

"  It  is  represented  that  the  lands  in  Michigan  territory,  designated  by  law  towards 
satisfying  the  land  bounties  promised  to  the  soldiers  of  the  late  army,  are  so 
covered   with  swamps   and   lakes,   or    otherwise    unfit  for   cultivation,   that   a   very

inconsiderable  proportion  can  be  applied  to  the  intended  grants.  I  recommend 
therefore  that  other  lands  be  designated  by  congress  for  the  purpose  of  supply- 
ing the  deficiency. 

"JAMES  MADISON." 

How  much  the  soldiers  would  have  been  wronged  we  will  leave  to  the  farmers 
in  southern  Michigan.  Later  statements  have  been  made  that  the  pine  timber 
being  nearly  exhausted  the  land  will  be  worthless.  Now  this  statement  is  about 
as  far  off  actual  facts  as  Tiffin  and  President  Madison.  The  pine  timber  has  been 
slaughtered  true  enough,  but  there  is  more  hardwood  timber  in  Michigan  than 
any  other  settled  state.  The  upper  part  of  the  lower  peninsula  is  full  of  it  and 
the  land  that  was  stripped  of  timber  is  developing  into  excellent  farming  land. 

Future  history  will  likely  record  events  or  dates  in  Michigan  as  periods  after 
the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century,  as  the  black  swamp  period,  the  lum- 
ber period,  the  iron  and  copper  period,  the  manufacturing  period,  and  finally  the 
farming  period. 

ALCONA   COUNTY. 

Alcona  county  was  organized  in  1869.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Alpena,  on 
the  east  by  Lake  Huron,  on  the  south  by  Iosco  and  on  the  west  by  Oscoda.  It 
has  an  area  of  about  720  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  5,409. 
Harrisville,  a  town  of  593  inhabitants,  situated  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  county, 
on  Lake  Huron,  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  comparatively 
level,  with  the  exception  of  the  townships  along  the  lake  shore,  which  are  more  or 
less  rolling.  Swamps  are  scattered  here  and  there  throughout  the  county,  but 
most  of  them  have  their  origin  in  springs  and  can  be  easily  reclaimed.  In  the 
western  portion  of  the  county  are  found  large  tracts  of  sandy  land,  much  of 
which  is  believed  to  have  a  soil  suitable  for  agricultural   purposes. 

The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Pine,  Au  Sable  and  Hubbard  rivers  and 
their  tributaries,  ample  water  power  for  all  milling  purposes  being  found  in  a 
number  of  localities.  The  soil  of  the  eastern  townships  is  generally  a  heavy 
clay  with  a  clay  subsoil;  while  that  of  the  "  plains "  is  either  a  sandy  loam  or 
a  clear  sand.  The  timber  consists  of  white  and  yellow  pine,  hemlock,  beech, 
maple,  cedar,  oak  and  some  black  birch.  The  older  portions  of  the  county  pro- 
duce good  crops  of  winter  and  spring  wheat,  oats,  barley,  etc.,  in  fact  few 
counties  can  show  a  larger  yield  to  the  acre,  as  wheat  has  been  produced 
yielding  an  average  of  45  bushels  to  the  acre.  Peas  and  all  kinds  of  vegetables 
are  also  grown  in  great  abundance.  The  experiments  in  fruit  raising  in  this 
comparatively  new  county  have  been  uniformly  successful.  Young  orchards  pre- 
sent a  thrifty  appearance,  and  the  lighter  fruits  will,  no  doubt,  amply  repay 
those  who  attempt  their  cultivation.  Berries  are  indigenous  to  the  soil,  and  as 
a  rule  yield  bountifully.  The  cost  of  clearing  the  heavier  timbered  lands  will 
average  about  $18  per  acre.  There  are  good  wood  markets  at  various  points, 
$2.50  being  the  uniform  price  for  cordwood. 

In  1891  there  were  subject  to  entry  and  sale  27,147  acres.  A  State  road  runs 
west  from  Harrisville  36  miles.  Lands  are  accessible  by  good  roads  throughout 
the  entire  county.  The  climate  is  equable,  the  winters  beginning  about  Decem- 
ber 1,  and  continuing  steadily  up  to  March  15.  The  snowfall  averages  about 
eight  inches  in  depth,  the  ground  freezing  but  little.  Plowing  is  usually 
begun  by  April  1  and  seeding  by  May  1.  The  schools  of  the  county  are 
comparatively  few,  but  are  well  sustained.  The  health  of  the  inhabitants  has 
been  generally  good,  the  invigorating  influence  of  the  lake  breeze  being  felt  to 
a  remarkable  extent,  particularly  during  the  summer  months.  Every  branch  of 
the  lumber  trade  is  carried  on  with  success.  Labor  is  in  good  demand,  wages 
ranging  from  $28  to  $38  per  month  with  board.  Improved  land  can  be  had  at 
prices  ranging  from  $10  to  $25  per  acre.  Unimproved  lands  are  proportionately 
less.  A  railroad  from  Standish,  on  the  Mackinac  division  of  the  Michigan  Cen- 
tral, to  Alpena,  extends  along  the  eastern  border  of  the  county.  Harrisville  already 
enjoys  an    extensive    lake  commerce.      Alcona    county,  with    its  cheap  lands  and

productive  soil,  offers  every  inducement  to  the  man  with  limited  means,  and  a 
good  class  of  immigrants  would  receive  a    hearty  welcome  from    its  inhabitants. 

ALGER  COUNTY 

was  organized  in  1885  from  Schoolcraft.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Lake 
Superior,  east  by  Luce  and  Schoolcraft,  south  by  Schoolcraft  and  Delta  and 
west  by  Marquette.  It  has  an  area  of  588,862  acres,  being  the  r2th  county  in 
size,  the  82d  in  population  and  67th  in  wealth.  Au  Train,  on  Bay  of  same 
name,  with  population  of  284  in  1890,  is  the  county  seat.  The  agricultural 
resources  of  the  county  are  as  yet  but  little  developed,  but  the  crops  natural 
to  the  climate  are  good.  The  soil  is  rich  and  fruits  of  various  kinds  grow  in 
abundance. 

There  are  no  navigable  rivers;  but  the  county  is  well  watered  and  drained 
and  has  its  share  of  inland  lakes.  It  has  about  seventy-five  miles  of  border  on 
Lake  Superior  besides  the  border  of  Grand  Island,  behind  which  is  the  largest 
and  best  harbor  on  the  lake  and  which  is  used  as  a  harbor  of  refuge.  The 
harbor  at  Grand  Marias  has  been  improved  by  the  United  States  government, 
and  is  regarded   as  good. 

The  timber  is  principally  beech,  maple,  birch,  elm,  pine,  hemlock  and  cedar. 
Most  of  the  pine  lands  have  been  lumbered  but  there  remains  about  200,000,000 
feet  yet  standing.  Unimproved  lands  are  worth  about  $4  per  acre  and  there  is 
a  large  amount  of  this  kind  of  land.  There  is  about  28,400  acres  of  public 
land  subject  to  sale  or  entry,  besides  railroad  lands.  Lumber,  charcoal  and 
brownstone  are  the  principal  industries  of  the  county  although  the  fishing 
interests  at  Grand  Marias  and  Au  Train  are  quite  extensive.  There  are  saw 
mills  at  Onoto  and  Rock  River  and  shingle  mills  at  Shingleton.  Brownstone  of 
excellent  quality  is  quarried  at  Rock  River  and  this  promises  to  be  the  great 
industry,  as  the  showing  for  fine  stone  is  excellent  in  several  localities.  The 
Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic  Railroad  passes  through  the  county,  giving 
railroad  communications  and  shipping  facilities  east   and  west. 

Fish  and  game  are  plentiful,  deer,  fox,  wolf  and  lynx.  In  inland  lakes  and 
streams  trout,  bass,  pike,  etc.,  abound. 

There  are  good  local  markets  for  produce  raised,  good  schools  and  church 
organizations. 

ALLEGAN  COUNTY. 

BY  J.    F.    HENRY,   SAUGATUCK. 

Allegan  county  was  organized  in  1835.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Ottawa 
and  Kent,  on  the  south  by  Van  Buren  and  Kalamazoo,  on  the  east  by  Barry, 
and  on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan.  It  has  an  area  of  828  square  miles,  divided 
into  24  townships  and  had  a  population  in  1892  of  38,961.  Allegan,  an  incorpo- 
rated village  of  about  3,000  inhabitants  situated  on  the  Kalamazoo  river  near  the 
geographical  center  of  the  county,  is  the  county  seat,  and  the  largest  town. 
Other  thriving  villages  are  Otsego,  Plainwell.  Wayland,  Fennville,  Martin,  Moline, 
Hopkins,  Hamilton,  Graafschap,  Douglas  and  Saugatuck.  The  latter  two  vil- 
lages, situated  near  the  mouth  of  the  Kalamazoo  river,  are  the  only  lake  ports 
of  the  county,  and  a  daily  line  of  steamers  to  Chicago  is  maintained  during  the 
season  of  navigation.  This  part  of  the  county  is  becoming  quite  a  summer  resort 
for  Chicago  and  Grand  Rapids  people.  Allegan,  Otsego,  Plainwell,  Hamilton  and 
other  points  enjoy  the  advantages  of  fine  water  power  and  considerable  milling 
and  manufacturing  is  done  in   the  county. 

The  topography  of  the  county  may  be  described  as  level  and  rolling.  There 
are  several  large  swamps  along  the  Black  and  Gun  rivers,  also  smaller  tracts  of 
marsh   land,  most  of  which  is  reclaimable. 

The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Kalamazoo,  Black  and  Gun  rivers  and 
numerous  little  inland  lakes.     In  the  eastern   part   are  many  flowing   wells. 

Almost  every  variety  of  soil  and  some  of  the  finest  farms  in  the  State  may 
be  found   in   this  county. 

The  reclaimed  swamp  lands  are  well  adapted  to  the  raising  of  celery,  onions 
and  cabbages.  In  Clyde  township  the  cultivation  of  pepperment  has  proved  to 
be   profitable.    The  southern  part  of  the  coast  line  of  western  Michigan  is  known 


212  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

as  the  "fruit  belt,"  and  that  portion  of  it  within  Allegan  county  is  not  excelled 
in  the  production  of  peaches,  grapes,  apples,  berries,  etc.  The  great  market 
which  Chicago  affords  and  opens  up  absorbs  all  the  fruit  which  can  be  mar- 
keted, and  the  beautiful  orchards  and  comfortable,  not  to  say  elegant,  homes,  which 
may  be  seen  throughout  the  fruit  belt,  bear  witness  to  the  fact  that  fruit 
culture  is  both  pleasant  and  profitable.  In  cereals,  wheat  is  the  principal  crop, 
but  large  quantities  of  corn  and  oats  are  raised.  There  are  now  no  lands  in 
Allegan  county  subject  to  entry.  Unimproved  hardwood  lands  from  which  the 
timber  has  been  taken  off  are  worth  from  §15  to  $30  an  acre.  Improved  farms 
are  held  at  from  $25  to  $100  per  acre,  according  to  location,  soil,  nature  of 
improvements,  etc. 

The  roads  as  a  general  thing  are  good,  and  in  some  parts  of  the  county 
excellent.  The  climate  is  salubrious.  In  summer  there  are  but  few  days  which 
are  oppressively  hot,  and  the  winters  are  not  severe,  the  mercury  seldom  falling 
much  below  freezing  point. 

Churches  and  school  houses  are  numerous  throughout  the  county  and  in  1892 
the  certificate  of  Allegan  high  school  admitted  to  the  University  of  Michigan 
without  further  examination. 

The  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan,  Lake  Shore  &amp;  Michigan  Southern,  Grand 
Rapids  &amp;  Indiana,  and  Cincinnati,  Jackson  &amp;  Mackinaw  railroads  traverse  the 
county  and  by  lake  and  rail  all  productions  of  the  county  find  a  ready  market 
in   the   cities  of  Chicago,  Milwaukee,   Grand  Rapids  and  Muskegon. 

ALPENA  COUNTY. 

Alpena  county  was  organized  in  1857.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Presque 
Isle,  on  the  west  by  Montmorency,  on  the  south  by  Alcona,  and  on  the  east  by 
Lake  Huron.  Alpena,  a  flourishing  city  of  11,283  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 
It  has  an  area  of  540  square,  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  15,581.  The 
surface  of  the  country  is  gently  rolling,  and  is  well  watered  by  Thunder  bay  and 
Hubbard  rivers,  also  by  innumerable  springs,  brooks  and  lakes,  which  abound  with 
all  varieties  of  fish,  and  afford  ample  water  power  in  many  townships.  There  are 
but  few  sand  plains  in  this  county,  but  a  considerable  quantity  of  swamp  land 
may  be  found,  nearly  all  of  which  is  subject  to  drainage.  The  soil  in  the  western 
portion  of  the  county  is  chiefly  a  dark  loam  with  clay  subsoil;  in  the  eastern  por- 
tion it  is  of  a  sandy  nature,  though  quite  fertile  in  many  localities.  The  prevail- 
ing varieties  of  timber  are  beech,  maple,  elm,  ash,  hemlock,  and  large  quantities  of 
cedar.  Winter  wheat,  oats,  peas  and  barley  are  successfully  grown.  Corn,  though 
not  a  staple  product,  often  yields  a  large  crop.  Apples,  pears  and  all  varieties  of 
plums  are  grown  on  every  farm,  and  always  flnd  a  ready  market  in  Alpena.  The 
cost  of  clearing  averages  about  $20  per  acre,  and  the  wood  cut  brings  from  $2.50 
to  $3.50  per  cord. 

There  are  22,320  acres  of  land  subject  to  entry  or  sale.  Plenty  of  desirable 
unimproved  lands  in  the  hands  of  private  parties  are  to  be  had  at  prices  ranging 
from  $2  to  $5  per  acre.  Some  of  the  most  valuable  lands  in  the  county  have  been 
pine  lands  originally.  The  best  farming  lands  are  located  three  or  four  miles  back 
from  the  mouth  of  the  rivers,  and  when  improved  are  held  at  from  $10  to  $50  per 
acre.  The  Alpena  and  Torch  Lake  State  road  leads  due  west  from  Alpena, 
through  the  center  of  the  county.  There  is  also  a  good  local  State  road  system, 
which  makes  all  parts  of  the  county  accessible. 

Alpena  has  about  six  months  of  fair  weather,  three  months  of  steady  winter 
and  three  months  of  very  broken  weather  in  the  spring  and  fall.  Snow  averages 
about  one  foot  in  depth  and  usually  comes  by  December  1.  Farmers  begin  plow- 
ing by  April  1.  The  schools  and  churches  are  in  a  flourishing  condition  and  the 
intelligence  of  Alpena  county  will  compare  very  favorably  with  any  locality  in  the 
State.  The  county  is  remarkably  free  from  malaria  and  fevers,  doubtless  owing  to 
the  influence  of  the  lake  on  its  eastern  border.  Lumbering  is  carried  on  exten- 
sively, and  labor  is  always  in  good  demand.  The  fishing  industry  is  by  no  means 
a  small  one,  and  a  large  number  of  men  and  boats  are  annually  employed  in 
catching  and  preparing  fish  for  the  Detroit  and  Cleveland  markets.  There  is  also 
a  large  traffic  in  cedar,  used  for  posts,  telegraph  poles  and  railroad  ties. 

The  road  leading  northward  from  Tawas  City  along  the  lake  shore  terminates  at 
Alpena,  but  will  eventually  be  built  through  Presque  Isle  to  Cheboygan.  It  has 
been  for  some  years  an  important  lake  port,  vessels  of  every  description  oeing  found

in  its  harbor  during  the  summer  season,  and  there  is  no  doubt  but  that  the  county 
will  at  once  feel  the  impetus  given  it  by  this  double  outlet. 

ANTRIM    COUNTY. 

Antrim  county  is  situated  on  the  east  side  of  Grand  Traverse  bay  and  embraces 
sixteen  townships  lying  in  towns  29,  30,  .31  and  .32  north,  in  ranges  5,  6,  7,  8  and 
9   west,  and  has  an   area  of  581   square   miles. 

It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Charlevoix  county,  on  the  east  by  Otsego,  on 
the  south  by  Kalkaska  and  Grand  Traverse  and  on  the  west  by  Grand  Traverse 
bay. 

Antrim  county  was  tirst  settled  by  the  whites  in  1848,  by  Abram  S.  "Wads- 
worth   at  the  mouth  of    Elk  river  near  the  southwest  corner  of   the  county. 

It  was  first  organized  as  the  township  of  Antrim,  Grand  Traverse  county,  in 
1853.    This  name   was  changed  to  Megezee  and   then   to   Elk   Rapids. 

The  county  of  Antrim  was  organized  in  the  spring  of  1863  and  the  first 
county  election  was  held  on  the  6th  day  of  April,  1863.  The  highest  number 
of  votes  cast  for  any  officer  was  66.  Bellaire,  the  county  seat,  is  situated  near 
the  geographical  center  of  the  county  and  was  first  settled  in  1879.  It  is  pleas- 
antly situated  on  the  Intermediate  river  and  has  an  excellent  water  power 
which  is  owned  by  Richardi  &amp;  Bechtold,  who  have  extensive  woodenware  works 
here. 

Elk  Rapids  is  situated  at  the  mouth  of  Elk  river,  which  is  the  outlet  of  the 
chain  of  lakes  that  traverse  the  county  from  northeast  to  southwest.  It  was 
originally  the  county  seat,  and  is  pleasantly  located  on  the  east  arm  of  Trav- 
erse bay,  and  the  most  famous  place  in  the  United  States  for  black  bass  fishing. 
Here  are  located  the  immense  smelting  works  of  the  Elk  Rapids  iron  company, 
and  the  Elk  Rapids  chemical  works  are  the  most  extensive  of  any  of  the  kind 
in  the  world.  It  has  excellent  school  and  church  advantages  and  is  one  of  the 
most   delightful   summer  resorts   in   Northern   Michigan. 

Mancelona  is  situated  in  the  southern  part  of  the  county  on  the  Grand  Rapids 
&amp;  Indiana  railroad,  and  is  a  thriving  manufacturing  town,  having  extensive 
woodenware  factories  and   the   Antrim   iron   works. 

There  are  now  two  railroads  running  through  the  county  from  north  to  south, 
to  wit:  The  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  and  the  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan  with  a 
branch  of   the  Chicago  &amp;   West  Michigan  running  to  Elk  Rapids. 

The  general  surface  of  the  county  is  rolling  and  in  the  northeastern  portion 
it  gets  somewhat  hilly.  The  soil  is  generally  a  sandy  loam  containing  a  large 
amount  of  lime  with  a  clay  soil  in  some  localities.  The  timber  contains  a  large 
variety,  sugar  maple,  beech,  elm,  cedar   and  hemlock   predominating. 

The  cereals  yield  very  well,  and  for  roots  and  vegetables  the  county  is  unsur- 
passed by  any  county  in  the  State.  In  the  western  part  of  the  county  all 
kinds  of  northern  fruit  are  a  sure  crop,  apples,  plums  and  pears  producing  very 
abundantly,  grapes  and  peaches  doing   well  in   some   localities. 

The  water  of  the  inland  lakes  is  of  rare  purity  and  abound  in  the  finest  of 
fish. 

The  climate  is  very  mild,  the  ground  seldom  freezing  in  the  winter,  the  snow- 
falling  early  protects  the  winter  wheat  from  the  freezing  and  thawing  that 
proves  so  destructive  to  winter  wheat  further  south.  The  climate  is  free  from 
malaria  and   bilious   diseases  are  very   rare. 

During  the  season  of  navigation  steamers  and  sailing  vessels  are  constantly 
plying  between  Elk  Rapids,  Torch  Lake  and  all  lake  ports.  Roads  are  now 
getting  good  throughout  the  county  and  school  advantages  are  unsurpassed  by 
the  older  counties  of   the   State. 

Taking  all  things  into  consideration  there  is  no  better  field  for  the  merchant, 
manufacturer  or  farmer   than  Antrim   county  offers. 

ARENAC  COUNTY. 

Arenac  county  was  organized  in  April,  1883.  It  had  a  population  of  5,683  in 
1890,  and  has  an  area  of  234,998  acres,  with  1,035  acres  subject  to  entry  or  sale. 
Lumber,  farm  products  and  fish  are  the  chief  products,  and  manufacturing  is 
carried   on   to   some  extent. 

Arenac  is  bounded  on  the   north  by  Ogemaw   and   Iosco    counties,  on  the  east

and  south  by  Saginaw  bay,  and  on  the  west  by  Gladwin  county.  Standish,  a  nice 
village  of  about  1,500  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  Michigan  Central  rail- 
road affords  the  chief  means  of  transportation. 

BARAGA  COUNTY. 

Baraga  county  was  organized  in  1875.  It  was  taken  from  Houghton,  and  is  bounded 
on  the  north  by  Houghton  and  Lake  Superior,  on  the  east  and  south  by  Mar- 
quette, and  on  the  west  by  Houghton  and  Sturgeon  river.  L'Anse,  a  town  of 
1,500  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  It  has  an  area  of  900  square  miles,  and 
had  a  population  in  1890  of  3,036.  The  surface  of  the  country  is  generally  undu- 
lating, although  some  level  land  is  found  in  the  Sturgeon  Bay  valley  and  in 
the  southeastern  townships. 

The  county  is  well  watered  by  a  number  of  streams,  the  Sturgeon  river,  on 
the  western  side,  being  the  largest  river  in  the  upper  peninsula.  Ample  water 
power  is  afforded  by  several  of  these  streams.  Nearly  every  variety  of  soil  is 
found,  the  valley  lands  being  particularly  rich.  The  subsoil  in  most  parts  con- 
sists of  gravel,  sand  and  clay,  underneath  which  can  be  found  either  slate  rock 
or  sandstone.  The  timber  consists  of  sugar  maple,  pine,  hemlock,  birch,  cedar, 
spruce  balsam  and  Norway  pine.  Some  wheat  is  raised,  but  the  principal  crops 
are  hay,  oats,  potatoes,  beans  and  garden  vegetables,  all  of  which  find  a  ready  mar- 
ket. Fruit  growing  is  in  its  infancy,  yet  several  varieties  of  apples  and  cherries 
are  grown  successfully.  Clearing  costs  about  $15  per  acre.  Hardwood  brings  from 
$3  to  $4  per  cord;  softwood   about  $2.    Farmers  do  not  plow  for  the  first  crop. 

There  are  34,346  acres  subject  to  entry  or  sale.  Many  of  these  lands  are  desir- 
able for  agricultural  purposes,  and  can  be  had  at  prices  ranging  from  $1.50  to  $5 
per  acre.  Three  State  roads  lead  out  "from  L'Anse  in  different  directions,  render- 
ing all  parts  of  the  county  accessible.  Snow  falls  in  November  and  leaves  about 
April  1.  The  winters  are  very  steady  and  the  climate  may  be  said  to  be  excep- 
tionally fine.  Farmers  commence  work  about  the  1st  of  May.  Free  schools  are 
open  ten  months  in  the  year. 

A  number  of.  iron  mines  are  in  constant  operation,  and  stone  and  slate  quarries 
are  being  successfully  developed.  These,  with  the  lumbering  and  fishing  industries, 
cause  a  demand  for  labor  at  all  times,  which  is  often  hard  to  supply.  The  Duluth, 
South  Shore  and  Atlantic  railroad  crosses  the  county,  also  the  Houghton  branch 
passes  through  L'Anse.  Railroads  are  projected  which,  with  the  excellent  water 
communication  (there  being  eighty  miles  of  sea  coast),  will  very  materially  aid  the 
eommercial  enterprises  of  this  new  and  rapidly  developing  county. 

BARRY  COUNTY. 

BY   M.   L.   COOK,   HASTINGS,   MICH. 

Barry  county  was  organized  in  1839.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Kent 
and  Ionia,  on  the  east  by  Eaton,  on  the  south  by  Calhoun  and  Kalamazoo,  and 
on  the  west  by  Allegan.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  a  population 
in  1890  of  23,783.  Hastings,  a  thriving  and  prosperous  city  of  3,500  people,  is 
the  county  seat,  where  the  county  has  just  finished  a  beautiful  court  house  and 
county  jail   at  an  expense  of  $75,000. 

The  surface  is  generally  rolling,  with  occasional  level  tracts,  but  all  parts  of 
the  county  are  tillable.  It  is  watered  mainly  by  the  Thornapple  river,  a  stream 
of  considerable  importance,  affording  several  good  water  power  privileges.  Numer- 
our  small  streams  flow  into  the  Thornapple.  There  are  many  picturesque  and 
beautiful  lakes,  affording  splendid  opportunities  for  boating  and  fishing,  some  of 
them  destined  to  be  favorite  resorts.  The  soil  of  ten  townships  is  clay,  with  a 
gravel  mixture.  In  the  other  six,  the  soil  is  more  or  less  sandy,  with  clay 
subsoil. 

Barry  county  can  still  boast  of  considerable  hardwood  timber,  and  lumbering 
is  usually  active  in  winter.  Agriculture  is  the  pursuit  of  the  great  majority  of 
its  inhabitants,  and  no  county  in  Michigan  can  raise  better  wheat  than  this. 
While  wheat  is  the  staple,  corn,  oats,  potatoes,  beans  and  barley  are  success- 
fully raised.  Plenty  of  grasses  are  raised  in  all  sections  of  the  county,  particu- 
larly on  the  heavy  timbered  lands  of  the  eastern   and  northern  portions. 


Michigan  by  Counties.  215 

Desirable  farm  lands  can  be  purchased  from  $20  to  $70  per  acre,  according  to 
location   and   condition. 

Like  most  counties,  Barry  county  needs  good  roads.  The  old  system  of  spring 
plowing  and  fall  scraping  of  highways  has  not  been  known  to  make  good  roads 
in  Barry  or  any  other  county.  The  county  will  average  with  its  neighbors  in 
the  matter  of  roads,  which  is  not  the  most  complimentary  thing  to  be  said  on 
the  subject. 

Barry  has  the   usual   climate  of  the   southern   tiers  of  counties    in   Michigan. 

No  county  in  Michigan  takes  more  pride  in  her  schools.  The  county  is  peopled 
almost  wholly  by  native  Americans,  who  value  the  school  house  and  the  church, 
and  prize  good  citizenship,  which  can  come  only  from  the  educated  citizen. 
There  are  150  school  districts  in  the  county,  and  153  school  buildings.  There  are 
over  fifty  church  buildings   in   the   county. 

Two  railroads  traverse  the  county,  the  Grand  Rapids  branch  of  the  Michigaa 
Central  from  east  to  west,  and  the  Chicago,  Kalamazoo  &amp;  Saginaw  from  south- 
west to  northeast.  Besides  these,  the  Cincinnati,  Jackson  &amp;  Mackinaw  and  the 
Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern  touch  the  county  at  the  southwestern  and  north- 
eastern corners  respectively.  These  roads  open  up  the  county  excellently,  and 
place   shipping  facilities   within   easy  reach  of   all. 

While  agriculture  is  the  principal  pursuit,  manufacturing  interests  are  becom- 
ing quite  important  in  Barry  county,  especially  at  Hastings,  which  has  the  only 
whip  factory   in  Michigan,   and   the   largest   wool   boot   factory  in   the   world. 

BAY    COUNTY. 

BY    W.    R.    M'CORMICK,    BAY    CITY. 

Bay  county  was  organized  in  1857.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Arenac,  on 
the  east  by  Tuscola,  and  Saginaw  bay,  on  the  south  by  Saginaw,  and  on  the  west 
by  Midland  and  Gladwin.  It  has  an  area  of  1,008  square  miles  and  has  a  population 
of  about  04,000. 

The  county  has  67  miles  of  excellent  stone  roads  and  more  are  being  built. 
These  run  in  various  directions  to  the  farming  districts  from  Bay  City,  the  county 
seat.  The  county  is  level,  with  the  exception  of  that  part  of  the  county  north  of 
Lincoln  and  Standish  counties,  which  is  slightly  rolling.  Although  there  is  a  large 
extent  of  coast  line  and  many  rivers  flowing  into  the  bay,  there  are  but  few  water 
powers,  and  those  are  somewhat  limited  in  capacity.  The  soil  is  a  deep,  rich  loam 
with  a  clay  sub-soil  mixed  with  limestone.  Oak,  elm,  basswood,  ash,  beech,  maple 
and  hemlock  comprise  the  principal  varieties  of  timber.  The  county  is  noted  for 
its  wheat.  Hay,  oats  and  corn  are  also  extensively  raised.  Apples  are  grown  in 
abundance.  The  fruit  buds  are  retarded  by  the  cool  lake  winds  and  thus  escape 
the  early  frosts.  The  smaller  fruits  are  a  more  uncertain  crop,  although  grapes  of 
the  hardier  varieties  do  well  along  the  shore. 

The  cost  of  clearing  averages  $20  per  acre,  and  the  wood  cut  finds  a  ready  mar- 
ket at  a  faij  price.  Good  farms  and  homes  in  towns  can  be  bought  on  easy  terms. 
There  are  large  tracts  of  timbered  land,  suitable  for  agricultural  purposes,  which 
can  be  had  at  prices  ranging  from  $8  to  $10  per  acre.  They  are  generally  within 
easy  reach  of  railroad  towns.  The  climate  is  a  variable  one.  Snow  falls  by 
December  1  and  averages  about  one  foot  in  depth  during  the  season.  The  ground 
generally  freezes  from  one  to  two  feet  in  depth,  hence  farmers  begin  work  about 
ten  days  later  than  in  southern  Michigan. 

The  privileges  incident  to  schools  and  churches  are  unexcelled,  the  public  schools 
of   Bay  City  being  especially  fine. 

All  sorts  of  enterprises  are  engaged  in  successfully.  Lumbering,  manufacturing, 
fishing  and  ship  building  is  carried  on  very  extensively,  over  two  thousand  men 
being  employed  in  the  ship  yards.  The  largest  pail  and  tub  factory  in  the  world 
is  located  in  Bay  City.  They  also  have  the  Water  Pipe  Company  and  the  Crystal 
water  works,  bicycle  factory,  industrial  works,  planing  mills,  sash  and  door  factories, 
saw  mills  and  salt  works. 

Common  labor  is  always  m  good  demand,  wages  ranging  from  $19  to  $30  per 
month,  with  board.  The  county  is  spending  a  large  amount  of  money  in  macada- 
mizing the  principal  thoroughfares  of  the  county,  and  every  portion  of  it  can  be 
readily  reached  by  railroads,  water  or  good  roads.

cianati,  Saginaw   &amp;   Muskegon   and    the    Grand    Trunk    railroads    aiford    excellent 
outlets    for    all    of    the  productions  of  the  county. 

Bay  City  is  an  important  lake  port,  the  largest  vessels  entering  its  harbor  during 
the  seasons  for  navigation. 

BENZIE    COUNTY. 

Benzie  county  was  organized  in  1869.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Leelenau 
and  Lake  Michigan,  on  the  east  by  Grand  Traverse,  on  the  south  by  Manistee  and 
on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan.  It  has  an  area  of  350  square  miles,  and  had  a 
population  in  1890  of  5,237.  Benzonia,  a  growing  town  of  about  500  inhabitants, 
situated  on  Crystal  lake,  is  the  county  seat.  A  strip  of  country  about  ten  miles 
in  width  along  the  lake  shore  is  of  a  hilly  character,  and  is  not  as  desirable  for 
farming  purposes  as  the  land  farther  east,  which  is  comparatively  level,  and  is 
remarkably  productive.  The  county  is  watered  by  two  small  streams  running 
through  it  from  east  to  west,  also  by  several  small  inland  lakes.  A  sandy,  gravelly 
soil  predominates,  but  there  are  large  tracts  containing  clay,  and  on  some  farms 
the  soil  is  little  else  than  clay;  on  others  it  is  a  sandy  loam,  warm  and  highly 
productive.  The  sugar  maple,  elm,  basswood,  beech,  birch,  white  oak,  hemlock  and 
cherry  constitute  the  prevailing  varieties  of  timber. 

The  soil  seems  well  adapted  to  all  root  crops.  Potatoes  grow  to  the  greatest 
perfection,  and  clover  does  remarkably  well.  In  good  seasons  wheat  and  corn  do 
well,  although  the  lack  of  rains  has  caused  some  diflBculty  for  a  few  years  past, 
owing  to  the  fact  that  the  ground  leaches  rapidly.  The  ten-mile  belt  referred  to 
above  produces  splendid  fruit,  and  in  fact  the  whole  northern  part  of  the  county 
may  be  said  to  be  a  fruit  growing  district.  Peaches,  pears,  apples,  plums,  grapes, 
cherries  and  berries  of  all  kinds  grow  in  profusion.  Peaches  have  grown  for 
twenty  years  without  interruption. 

The  cost  of  clearing  averages  about  $15  per  acre,  and  wood  finds  a  ready  market 
in  several  localities.  There  are  5,630  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  Good 
agricultural  lands,  well  timbered,  can  be  had  at  from  $3  to  $15  per  acre. 

Two  State  roads  pass  through  the  county,  one  from  Manistee  along  the  lake 
shore  to  Frankfort  and  Leland,  and  the  other  from  Manistee  to  Traverse  City, 
passing  through  Benzonia,  Garfield,  Almira  and  Homestead. 

The  climate  is  a  very  desirable  one,  the  seasons  following  each  other  without 
the  marked  variations  in  temperature  found  in  counties  further  south.  The 
ground  does  not  freeze  and  plowing  begins  in  April.  The  average  depth  of  snow 
is  two  feet. 

The  schools  are  very  good,  and  a  college  at  Benzonia  prepares  teachers  for  the 
common  and  graded  schools. 

There  is  a  constant  demand  for  labor,  owing  to  the  development  of  so  many 
industries  incident  to  a  timbered  country.  Several  lines  of  steamers  touch  at 
Frankfort,  affording  an  outlet  for  the  products  of  the  county.  A  large  iron  fur- 
nace near  Frankfort  creats  a  steady  demand  for  harwood,  and  employs  a  large 
number  of  men.  The  Frankfort  &amp;  Southeastern,  the  Manistee  &amp;  Northeastern  and 
Chicago  and  West  Michigan  railroads  pass  through  the  county. 

BERRIEN  COUNTY. 

BY   HENRY   CHAMBERLAIN,   THREE   OAKS. 

Berrien  is  the  southwest  county  of  the  State.  Its  western  boundary  is  Lake 
Michigan.  Its  principal  rivers  are  the  St.  Joseph,  Paw  Paw,  Dowagiac  and 
Galien,  with  many  minor  streams.  All  of  these  streams  furnish  water  power  of 
great  volume,  about  one-half  of  which  is  unimproved.  All  parts  of  the  county 
are  within  seventy-five  miles  of  Chicago,  which  is  reached  by  two  railroads  and 
by  vessels  from  the  mouth  of  the  St.  Joseph  river.  The  Michigan  Central,  Chi- 
cago &amp;  West  Michigan,  the  Vandalia  and  the  Wabash  &amp;  Michigan  railroads 
pass  through  the  county.  There  are  but  few  farms  which  are  more  than  eight 
miles  from   a  railroad   station. 

The  county  is  generally  level  or  gently  rolling  with  no  broken  land  except 
along  the  banks  of  the  larger  streams  and  Lake  Michigan.  The  larger  part  of 
the  soil  is  a  rich  gravelly  or  sandy  loam;  parts  of  six  townships  are  clay  or 
clay  loam.    A   narrow  strip  along  Lake  Michigan  is  a  thin,  sandy  soil.    There  are 


Michigan  by  Counties.  217 

many  small  lakes  and  quite  a  number  of  marshes  in  the  county.  Some  of  the 
marshes  have  but  little  value  except  for  pasture  or  wild  hay;  but  many  have 
great  value  for  the  production  of  celery,  peppermint,  onions,  cabbage,  potatoes 
and   other   vegetables. 

The  principal  products  of  the  county  are  wheat,  corn,  rye,  oats,  barley,  pota- 
toes and  hay,  with  a  fair  amount  of  butter  and  cheese.  The  lands  are  all 
valuable  for  hay  and  pasture,  and  sheep  and  cattle  are  raised  and  fed  for 
market. 

All  parts  of  the  county  grow  apples,  pears,  quinces  and  grapes.  The  "  fruit 
belt"  on   the   lake   shore  grows  peaches  and   the  small   fruits   in  large  quantities. 

A.  very  large  portion  of  the  county  was  originally  covered  with  heavy  timber, 
beech,  maple,  walnut,  hickory,  ash,  whitewood,  elm,  basswood  and  oak,  much  of 
it  very  valuable.  A  smaller  part  was  openings  upon  which  grew  white,  yellow, 
black  and  burr  oak  and  hickory.  There  are  a  number  of  small  prairies  in  the 
county.  The  lands  are  all  now  cleared,  except  small  tracts  connected  with  farms, 
kept  for  fuel  and  fencing.  There  is  but  little  unimproved  land  in  the  county. 
The  improved  lands  are  held  at  from  S30  to  $125  dollars  per  acre  for  farm 
purposes;   fruit   lands  $30   to  $500  per   acre. 

The  manufactures  are  wood  pulp  and  paper,  flour  and  meal,  furniture,  agri- 
cultural  implements,   machinery,  etc. 

Niles,  Benton  Harbor  and  St.  Joseph  are  the  cities.  Buchanan,  Berrien  Springs, 
Three  Oaks  and  Watervliet  are  the  larger  villages,  with  twenty  or  more  other 
villages   and  hamlets  with  from   50  to  600  inhabitants. 

The  lake  fisheries  are  principally  located  at  St.  Joseph,  from  the  mouth  of 
which   river  there   is  a  large  vessel    interest. 

The  markets  are  the   cities  and   villages  of   the  county,  Chicago  and  the  world. 

There  is  a  school  and  school  house  in  every  rural  district  and  a  graded  or 
high  school  in  every  city  or  village.  Churches  and  church  edifices  are  numerous 
enough  to  enable  all  the  people  to  attend  churches  of  their  own  faith.  Wages 
of  farm  labor  are  $15  to  $30  per  month  and  board;  common  labor,  $1  to  $1.50 
per  day;  skilled  labor,  $2  to  $3.50  per  day.  There  are  fish  in  most  of  the  lakes 
and  streams.  The  larger  game  is  all  gone,  and  ducks,  quail  and  squirrels  are  not 
at   all   abundant.     There  are  no  stone  quarries  or  mineral  lands  in   the   county. 

BRANCH    COUNTY. 

BY   DWIGHT   E.   YOUNGS,   UNION   CITY. 

Branch  county's  first  permanent  settler  located  where  is  now  the  village  of 
Bronson  in  1828.  He  was  followed  the  next  year  by  some  who  located  at  Girard 
and  Coldwater.  The  county  was  formed  by  an  act  passed  by  the  legislative  coun- 
cil October  29,  1829,  and  named  for  Hon.  John  Branch,  of  North  Carolina,  Presi- 
dent Jackson's  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  but  was  associated  with  several  other 
counties,  known  as  the  township  of  Green,  until  1833,  when,  having  about  70  voters, 
the  county  commenced  its  independent  existence.  It  is  bounded  north  by  Calhoun, 
east  by  Hillsdale,  south  by  Indiana  and  west  by  St.  Joseph.  It  has  an  area  of 
516  square  miles.  Population,  1890,  was  26,791.  Coldwater,  the  county  seat,  with 
5,247  inhabitants,  was  platted  as  a  village  in  18.32,  organizing  with  a  charter,  1837. 
The  years  from  1831  to  1837  witnessed  the  advent  of  large  numbers  of  permanent 
settlers  in  all  parts  of  the  county.  Union  City  was  platted  in  1835  as  Goodwins- 
ville.  Quincy  had  an  existence  as  a  little  more  than  a  country  four  corners  until 
the  advent  of  the  railroad,  but  was  incorporated  in  1858;  since  then  its  growth  has 
been  rapid.  Bronson  was  incorporated  in  1866  and  given  the  name  of  its  first 
settler,  who  was  Jabe  Bronson,  but  a  portion  of  its  area  was  platted  in  1833,  as 
York.  Sherwood,  a  lively  little  town  on  the  Air  Line  railroad,  has  grown  up  since 
the  building  of  that  road,  was  platted  while  it  was  being  graded. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  generally  level,  although  a  small  portion  is  gently 
rolling,  no  hills.  There  are  four  streams  passing  through  parts  of  the  county,  all, 
however,  uniting  their  waters  with  the  St.  Joseph  at  Union  City,  which  passes 
through  the  county  in  a  southwesterly  direction.  About  three-fifths  of  the  county 
has  a  soil  of  a  sandy  or  gravelly  loam  with  a  hard  subsoil,  the  remainder  a  heavy 
clay  especially  adapted  to  grazing  and  stock  raising. 

The  timber  on  the  heavy  soil  was  principally  beech  and  maple,  many  maple 
orchards  being  retained  to  the  present.  There  is  also  an  abundance  of  ash,  elm, 
basswood,  with  some  cherry,  black  walnut  and  butternut,  while  on  the  lighter  soil

until  March.  Two  or  throe  oxci^ptional  years  have  given  winter  from  the  middle 
of  November  to  the  lOth  of  April.  CrojjS  are  good  with  few  exceptions  in  the  past 
5)5  yeare.     May  1  generally  furnishes  an  abundance  of  now  feed  for  stock. 

The  best  of  wat(M-  is  supplied  from  wells,  15  to  4.5  feet  in  depth.  For  soft  water

The  system  of  drainage  adopted  to  dispose  of  any  sur{)lu9  water  has  made  the 
county  ae  liealthy  a  r((gion  as  anywhere  found.  Ague  and  fever  being  practically

years,  a  few    fourscore   and    ton. 

IJranch  county  nuiy  be  justly  i)roud  of  her  religious  and  educational  advan- 
tages. There  are  largo  and  commodious  school  buildings  in  the  principal  vil- 
lages, while  the  country  districts  aro  supplied  with  neat  and  comfortable  structures. 
Every  village  has  churches  for  the  ditforont  denominations,  and  many  country 
four   corners   are   supplied    with    the   same. 

Manufacturing  is  carried  on  quite  extensively  in  the  larger  towns.  Many 
induccMucnts  are  hold  out  to  draw  such  industries  to  the  villages,  now  largely 
deiunidont   on    the   farming   country   around    for   support. 

'I'lie  Ijake  Shore  A-  Mic;higan  Southern  railroad  maui  line  passes  through 
(^uincy,  Coldwater,  Hatavia,  a  corner  of  15ethel  and  Hronson,  while  the  Air  Line 
of  the  Michigan  Central  passes  through  Union  and  Sherwood,  the  Fort  Wayne, 
.Jac'kson   A  Saginaw    nearly   touching   the  southeast  corner   of   tho  county. 

There  aro  a  number  of  beautiful  inland  lakes,  one  near  the  village  of  Quincy 
which  has  been  connected  with  others  to  the  south  and  west  by  moans  of  a 
canal,  with  a  view  to  navigation  through  a  string  of  lakes  to  Orland,  Ind.,  a 
distance   of   about    forty    miles. 

A  b(&gt;autiful  sheet  of  water  eight  miles  south  of  Coldwater,  through  which 
the  Coldwater  river  flows,  giving  it  its  name,  is  about  six  miles  by  one  and  a 
half  in  extent,  in  which  is  an  island  of  40  acres,  is  utilized  as  a  summer  resort 
by  residents  of  tho  county.  Cottages  have  been  erected  on  its  shores,  to  which 
they  migrate  during  the  heat  of  summer.  Another  similar  resort  is  located 
about  throe  miles  north  of  the  city  on  a  lake  provided  with  a  small  excursion 
steamboat   to   accommodate   picnic  and    pleasure  parties. 

In  th(^  early  days  before  tho  advent  of  steam  in  tho  State,  the  St.  Joseph  river 
was  doomed  a  navigable  stream  anil  Union  City  tho  head  of  navigation,  but  its 
waters   have   never    been    turned   to   account   for   this   purpose. 

CALHOUN  COUNTS'. 

Calhoun  county  was  organized  in  W.V,\  It  is  bounded  on  tho  north  by  Barry 
and  i'jaton,  on  the  east  by  .Jackson,  on  the  south  by  Branch  and  Hillsdale  and 
on  the  west  by  Kalamazoo.  Marshall,  a  city  of  .'?,iH)8  inhabitants,  is  tho  county 
seat.  Tho  surface  (jf  the  county  has  an  area  of  720  square  miles,  and  had  a  popu- 
lation in  IHOO  of  4;{,r)01.  The  surfacii  of  the  county  is  gently  rolling.  The  Kalama- 
zoo river  crosses  the  county  from  east  to  west,  affording  a  number  of  water  powers. 
There  aro  several  Houring  mills  in  the  county  which  are  run  by  water.  The 
county  is  otherwise  well  watered  by  a  nund)er  of  small  streams.  Nearly  every 
vari(^ty  of  soil  is  found,  a  light,  sandy  loam  characterizing  some  townships,  and  a 
strong  clay  others.  A  good  clay  subsoil  generally  underlies  the  surface  at  a  proper 
depth. 

Oak  itr  tho  principal  variety  of  limber,  although  there  is  some  beech,  maple, 
whitowood,  elm  ami  walnut.  Whoat  and  corn  aro  extensively  raised.  The  soil  pro- 
duces wonderfully  well,  though  of  a  light  appearance  in  localities.  Garden  vegeta- 
bles of  every  variety  grow  abundantly  with  little  care.  Apples  aro  tho  principal 
fruit  crop,  though  ])oachos  and  pears  aro  raised  to  a  limited  extent.  The  smaller 
fruits  are  succoHsfulIy  grown  in  every  township. 

The  timber  on  any  available  tract  would  pay  for  the  clearing,  as  there  is  a  good 
market    for    wood.     There    are    no     government    or    state    lands    on    the    market.

220  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

Cassopolis,  situated  on  the  bank  of  Stone  lake,  a  half  a  mile  distant  from  the 
beautiful  Diamond  lake,  is  the  county  seat  with  a  population  of  1,500  with  two 
railroads,  the  Michigan  Central  air  line  and  the  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk,  its 
manufacturing  interests  consisting  of  a  bowl  factory,  foundry,  saw  and  flouring  mills. 
Dowagiac,  situated  on  the  Michigan  Central  main  line,  and  commercially  one  of  its 
most  important  stations,  is  in  the  northern  part  of  the  county,  one  hundred  miles 
east  of  Chicago,  has  a  population  of  3,500.  With  the  manufacturing  industries  of 
the  famous  "  Round  Oak "  stoves,  Dowagiac  shoe  grain  drills,  chair  factory,  marble 
works,  sand  bands,  washing  machines,  saw  and  flouring  mills,  sash  and  door  factory, 
planing  mills  and  many  other  minor  industries.  The  city  contains  the  finest  opera 
house  in  America  for  a  town  of  its  size,  the  "Beckwith  Memorial  Building,"  and 
with  its  thirteen  miles  of  cement  walks,  well  kept  streets  and  homes,  with  its  system 
of  water  works,  supplied  directly  from  artesian  wells,  and  electric  lights,  its  literary 
and  musical  societies  and  fine  public  library,  all  corroborate  the  unanimous  state- 
ments of  commercial  travelers  that  it  is  the  thriftiest,  neatest  and  most  attractive 
town  of  its  size  in  the  country  and  will  bear  the  most  thorough  investigation  if  in 
pursuit  of  a  place  that  combines  rare  advantages  for  business  and  a  home. 

CHARLEVOIX  COUNTY. 

Clarlevoix  county  was  organized  in  1869.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Emmet 
and  Lake  Michigan,  on  the  east  by  Cheboygan  and  Otsego,  on  the  south  by  Antrim, 
and  on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan.  It  has  an  area  of  396  square  miles,  and  had  a 
population  in  1890  of  9,686.  Charlevoix,  a  flourishing  village  of  1,500  inhabitants,  sit- 
uated on  Lake  Michigan,  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  everywhere 
rolling,  and  in  some  parts  decidedly  hilly.  The  county  is  well  watered.  Pine  lake, 
a  beautiful  sheet  of  water,  stretching  14  miles  in  an  easterly  direction  from  Charlevoix 
village.  Six  miles,  from  Charlevoix,  a  branch  of  the  lake  runs  in  a  southerly  direction 
eight  miles.  The  branch  is  fed  by  the  famous  trout  fishing  stream,  the  Jordan.  The 
Boyne  flows  in  at  the  east  end  of  the  lake,  and  the  county  generally  is  covered  with 
innumerable  spring  brooks  of  the  coldest  water.  There  is  some  available  water  power, 
particularly  on  the  Jordan  and  Boyne  rivers.  The  soil  varies  from  a  light  sandy  to 
a  heavy  clay,  filled  with  calcareous  matter.  The  subsoil  is  of  as  varied  a  nature  as 
that  of  the  surface. 

Sugar  maple,  elm,  beech,  basswood,  ash,  hemlock,  and  cedar  timber  is  found  in 
great  quantities  throughout  the  county. 

The  principal  crops  are  winter  wheat,  oats  corn,  hay,  clover,  potatoes,  and  root  crops. 
The  summer  resorts  at  Charlevoix  furnish  an  excellent  market  for  all  sorts  of  garden 
vegetables. 

All  fruits  do  well,  excepting  grapes  and  peaches.    The  hardier  kind  of  apples  are 
especially  successful.     Charlevoix  county  is  at  the  northern  extremity  of  the  cele 
brated  Michigan  fruit  belt.     The  cost  of  clearing  averages  $20  per  acre,  although  the 
wood  produced  generally  pays  for  the  clearing. 

There  are  no  government  lands  in  the  market.  There  are  3,070  acres  of  land  subject 
to  entry  or  sale. 

Unimproved  lands  are  held  at  from  $7  to  $10  per  acre,  while  improved  farms  average 
from  $15  to  $60,  in  the  interior,  and  from  $25  to  $100  near  Charlevoix.  There  is  a  State 
road  from  Traverse  City  to  Petoskey,  which  crosses  the  county.  There  are  a  number 
of  wagon  roads  traversing  the  county,  most  of  which  are  new,  but  are  steadily  improv- 
ing. There  are  also  several  tramroads  built  through  belts  of  hardwood  timber  which 
facilitate  travel.  Much  of  the  travel  in  summer  is  by  water.  The  winter  is  very 
steady,  snow  falling  by  November  15,  and  lasting  five  months.  The  summer  season  is 
delightful,  and  the  county  is  a  great  resort  for  invalids  afflicted  with  asthmatic  diffi- 
culties.   The  schools  are  very  creditable  for  a  new  county. 

As  Pine  lake  is  navigable  for  large  vessels,  the  timber  business  is  an  important 
enterprise  iu  this  county.  Wood,  ties,  fence  posts,  hemlock  bark  and  logs  are  cut  dur- 
ing the  winter,  and  are  shipped  during  the  summer  to  Chicago,  Milwaukee,  Racine, 
and  other  lake  ports.  There  are  several  saw  mills  in  the  county.  An  iron  furnace  at 
Ironton,  on  Pine  lake,  furnishes  employment  to  a  large  number  of  men.  The  fishing 
industry  is  also  a  considerable  one. 

The  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroad  passes  through  Charlevoix. 

The  famous  resorts  on  Pine  lake  have  contributed  largely  to  the  development  of 
the  county,  and  are  thronged  every  summer  with  admirers  of  the  beautiful  scenery  and 
delightful  climate  of  Charlevoix  county. 


Michigan  by  Counties.  221 

CHEBOYGAN  COUNTY. 
BY    EDWARD    FORSYTH,    OF    CHEBOYGAN. 

Cheboygan  county  wag  organized  in  1853.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Lake 
Huron  and  the  Straits  of  Mackinaw,  on  the  east  by  Lake  Huron  and  Presque 
Isle  county,  on  the  south  by  Otsego  and  Montmorency,  and  on  the  west  by 
Emmet  and  Charlevoix.  Cheboygan,  a  rapidly  growing  town  of  7,000  inhabitants, 
is  the  county  seat.  It  is  a  live  port,  with  all  modern  improvements,  sewers, 
paved  streets,  street  cars,  electric  lights.  §40.000  opera  house,  splendid  schools 
and  churches.  The  county  has  an  area  of  792  square  miles  and  had  a  popula- 
tion in  1890  of  11,145.  The  surface  of  the  cgunty  is  greatly  diversified,  level 
plains  being  found  in  some  localities  and  rolling  land  in  others,  the  hills  on  the 
borders  of  the  lake  sometimes  rising  to  a  height  of  200  feet.  It  is  watered  by 
the  Rainy,  Black,  Pigeon,  Cheboygan  and  Maple  rivers,  also  by  Cheboygan,  Black, 
Mullet,  Burt  and  Douglass  lakes.  Several  of  these  rivers  and  lakes  are  navi- 
gable, affording  excellent  opportunities  for  transportation  of  wood,  bark,  etc., 
and  the  rafting  of  logs.  The  streams  furnish  good  water  power  in  various  places, 
and  are  alive  with  fish.  The  shores  of  these  lakes  are  rapidly  becoming  popular 
summer  resorts,  which  furnish  splendid  markets  for  all  kinds  of  farm  produce, 
butter,  eggs,  vegetables,  milk,  cheese,  berries,  etc.,  from  June  until  October,  at 
city  prices.  The  region  is  a  hay  fever  sanitarium,  which  keeps  the  resorts  open 
until  frost  comes.  Among  these  resorts  are  Topinabee,  Dodge's  Point  and  Koehlers 
on  Mullett  lake.  Columbus  Landing  and  Columbus  Beach  on  Burt  lake,  Roose 
&amp;  Grace's  hotel  on  Long  lake,  besides  other  resorts  on  Douglass,  Black  and 
Carp  lakes.  The  soil  is  composed  of  red  clay  in  some  portions  and  sand  and 
clay  loam  in  others,  generally  rich  and  productive.  The  timber  consists  of  maple, 
beech,  pine,  cedar,  hemlock,  poplar,  elm  and  basswood.  The  principal  crops  are 
wheat,  corn,  oats,  hay,  potatoes  and  vegetables,  all  of  which  are  successfully 
grown.  Apples,  plums,  cherries  and  berries  do  well,  but  peaches  and  pears  are 
not  as  "successful.  The  wild  berry  crop  nets  SIO.OOO  to  $15,000  a  year.  Straw- 
berries, huckleberries,  raspberries  and  blackberries  grow  wild  in  abundance. 
Market  now  exists  for  every  stick  of  timber  grown  in  the  county.  Dozens  of 
little  hardwood  mills  exist  all  over  the  county,  while  a  big  tannery  at  Cheboy- 
gan consumes  20,000  cords  of  hemlock  bark  a  year  and  a  stave  mill  uses  up 
from  3,000,000  to  6,000,000  of  elm  annually.  All  kinds  of  wood  is  in  demand  in 
the  log,  or  as  ties,  posts,  bark,  cordwood  or  pulp  wood  and  brings  from  $2.50 
per  thousand  feet  for  basswood  to  $8.50  for  elm  and  §50  for  curly  maple.  Cord- 
wood  sells  green  at  from  §1.25  to  §1.75  and  dry  for  §2  a  cord.  There  are  27,525 
acres  of  public  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry  beside  railroad  land  claims.  Gov- 
ernment land  for  entry  only  can  be  had  by  application  to  United  States  land 
office  at  Grayling.  State  land  can  be  bought  or  entered  at  State  land  office, 
Lansing.  Improved  farms,  individual  lands,  can  be  had  at  reasonable  prices, 
sometimes  far  below   actual   value. 

A  State  road  runs  from  Cheboygan  to  Petoskey  and  one  from  Cheboygan  to 
Rogers  City.  Other  roads  of  more  recent  construction  cross  the  county  in  all 
directions  and  more  are  being  built  as  the  progress  of  the  county  demands,  and 
for  nine  months  in  the  year  they  are  excellent.  They  are  being  rapidly  improved 
and  new  roads  opened.  Snow  usually  falls  about  November  15.  The  average 
depth  attained  during  the  winter  may  be  said  to  be  about  twenty  inches.  The 
ground  seldom  freezes  and  spring  work  commences  early  in  May.  Grass  is  king; 
one  acre  will  support  as  much  life  as  the  best  blue  grass  land  of  Kentucky. 
The  schools  of  the  county  are  numerous  and  of  the  best  kind,  with  a  competent 
county  commissioner  in  charge  and  the  people  show  great  enterprise  in  building 
new  school  houses  as  fast  as  necessary.  The  county  is,  in  the  main,  free  from 
malaria.  The  great  changes  in  temperature  cause  some  rheumatic  complaints,  but 
as  a  rule,  the  county  is  very  healthy.  The  lumbering  interests  are  very  extensive, 
employing  at  remunerative  wages  a  great  many  men.  Besides  this  industry,  there 
is  in  Cheboygan  a  big  tannery  employing,  all  told.  250  to  300  hands  the  year  round; 
a  125-barrel  flouring  mill  and  one  of  fifty  barrels  capacity,  three  foundries,  three 
planing  mills,  electric  lights,  ship  yards,  etc.,  and  as  fast  as  land  can  be  cleared 
new  farms  are  being  developed,  which  add  yearly  to  the  wealth  and  resources  of 
the  county.  Fishing  is  also  extensively  engaged  in.  Labor  is  always  in  good 
demand.

Michigan  and  its  Resoueces. 


The  Michigan  Central  railroad  (Mackinaw  division)  passes  through  Cheboygan, 
and  the  Detroit,  Bay  City  &amp;  Alpena  railroad  will  reach  the  southern  borders  of 
the  county  before  snow  flies,  and  will  go  north  to  the  straits  next  year,  opening 
up  a  magnificent  railroad  region.  Lake  vessels  of  the  largest  size  enter  its  two 
harbors,  one  of  which  is  in  Cheboygan  and  the  other  at  Duncan  City,  a  mile 
distant. 


CHIPPEWA  COUNTY. 


BY   C.   H.    CHAPMAN,    SAULT    STE   MARIE. 


Chippewa  county  was  organized  in  1826,  ten 
years  before  Michigan  was  admitted  into  the  union  as 
a  State,  and  embraced  nearly  the  entire  upper  penin- 
sula of  Michigan,  all  of  the  north  part  of  Wisconsin 
and  all  of  the  north  part  of  Minnesota  east  of  the  Mis- 
sissippi river.  It  has  been  reduced  from  time  to  time 
until  now  it  is  bounded  on  the  north  and  east  by  the 
St.  Mary's  river  and  Lake  Superior,  on  the  south  by 
Mackinac  and  Lake  Huron,  and  on  the  west  by  Mack- 
inac and  Luce  counties.  It  is  the  second  county  in 
size  in  the  State  and  has  a  total  of  995,225  acres.  The 
population  in  1880  was  5,248,  and  in  1890  had 
increased  to  12,019,  an  increase  of  129.02  per  cent, 
not  including  the  county  of  Luce,  organized  out  of 
this  territory  during  this  period.  In  1891  this  county 
contained  17,430  acres  of  improved  farm  land  and 
38,978  acres  in  farms  partially  improved.  The  aver- 
age number  of  acres  in  each  farm  in  the  county  was 
131.49.  The  assessed  valuation  as  equalized  in  1890 
was  $5,000,000.  The  county  now  contains  public  lands 
COURT  HOUSE.  subject  to  sale  or  entry,   121,009  acres;  homes  of  80 

acres  each  for  1,512  families.  Its  population  is  largely  of  the  best  class  of  Canadians. 
Sault  Ste.  Marie,  a  city  of  8,000  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  This  city  is  located  on 
the  St.  Mary's  river  at  a  point  where  the  government  canal  around  the  rapids  was 
constructed.  It  has  three  trunk  lines  of  railroads  and  other  lines  are  pushing  in  this 
direction.  The  river  is  spanned  by  the  great  international  bridge  at  this  point,  mak- 
ing a  short  rail  route  between  the  Atlantic  states  and  the  great  west. 

The  surface  of  this  county  is  gently  rolling.  In  the  northern  portion  of  the  county 
there  is  considerable  sandy  land,  also  a  few  cedar  swamps  which  are  easily  drained. 
The  eastern  portion,  particularly  that  lying  south  of  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  comprising  also 
a  part  of  what  are  now  known  as  the  "  burnt  lands,"  is  a  very  desirable  agricultural 
region,  the  soil  being  a  deep  red  clay,  which  is  easily  worked,  and,  after  exposure  to  the 
atmosphere,  pulverizes,  and  is  not  liable  to  become  sun-baked  or  cracked.  The  soil  is 
peculiarly  adapted  to  the  raising  of  peas,  and  the  entire  absence  of  bugs  makes  the 
crops  much  sought  after  by  seedsmen.  A  small  portion  of  the  middle  part  of  the 
county  has  a  light  sandy  soil,  timbered  with  scattering  pine,  and  surrounded  by  fine 
bodies  of  hardwood  land  with  a  rich,  sandy-loam  soil.  The  western  portion  is  timbered 
with  pine  of  a  good  quality.  There  are  also  large  tracts  of  choice  hardwood  land 
interspersed  with  scattering  pine.  The  southern  portion  of  the  western  part  of  the 
county  is  the  valley  of  the  Tahquamenon.  The  timber  is  cedar  and  pine.  On  the 
bottoms  are  extensive  meadows  of  blue  joint  grass,  the  soil  being  a  dark  vegetable 
mould  with  clay  subsoil.  The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Tahquamenon  and  its 
many  branches;  also  by  the  St.  Mary's,  Two-hearted,  Munnuscong,  Carp  and  numerous 
smaller  streams  and  inland  lakes.  Fine  water  powers  are  to  be  found  on  many  of 
these  streams.  St.  Mary's  river  has  one  of  the  finest  water  powers  in  the  world,  there 
being  a  fall  of  18  feet  between  Lakes  Superior  and  Huron. 

The  principal  crops  are  wheat,  oats,  barley,  peas,  hay,  and  all  sorts  of  root  crops. 
Considerable  attention  has  been  paid  to  farming  within  the  past  sixteen  years.  The 
county  took  the  first  prize  for  spring  and  winter  wheat  at  the  State  fair  held  at  Jack 
son  in  the  fall  of  1882.  Corn  is  not  successfully  grown.  Peas,  hay  and  potatoes  are 
among  the  most  profitable  crops.  The  smaller  fruits  grow  to  great  perfection  and  are 
of  the  finest  flavor.  All  sorts  of  berries  grow  in  abundance,  but  the  larger  fruits  do  not 
succeed  as  well,  owing  to  the  length  of  the  winters. 


Michigan  by  Counties.  223 

There  are  large  tracts  of  "burnt  lands"  which  can  be  cleared  at  from  82.50  to  SIO  per 
acre.  The  cost  of  clearing  the  heavier  timbered  lands,  however,  will  average  S15  per 
acre.  There  are  good  wood  markets  at  the  Sault  and  at  the  towns  along  the  Detroit, 
Mackinac  &amp;  Marquette  Railroad. 

In  addition  to  the  public  lands  open  for  sale  or  entry  as  homesteads,  there  are  about 
400,000  acres  of  canal,  railroad  and  lumbermen's  lands  subject  to  sale  at  prices  ranging 
from  8i  to  910  per  acre,  according  to  location.  Along  the  lines  of  the  railroads  large 
tracts  are  being  taken  up,  both  by  the  settlers  and  by  non-residents,  who  can  foresee 
their  future  value.  A  State  road  connects  St.  Ignace  with  the  Sault.  There  are  also 
many  local  roads,  newly  made,  which  are  opening  up  the  country  in  every  direction. 
Winter  sets  in  early.  The  snow  falls  to  an  average  depth  of  three  feet,  the  ground  sel- 
dom freezing.  Plowing  begins  as  soon  as  the  snow  is  off  the  ground,  generally  by 
April  1.  Crops  mature  rapidly,  owing  to  a  peculiarity  of  the  climate.  The  atmos- 
phere is  remarkably  dry,  and  is  tempered  and  equalized  by  the  great  lakes  to  the  north 
and  south.  The  health  of  the  citizens  of  this  locality  is  materially  improved  by  the 
entire  absence  of  malaria. 

The  lakes  and  spring  brooks  are  filled  with  every  variety  of  brook  trout,  the  best 
evidence  in  the  world  of  the  purity  of  their  waters. 

There  are  forty-three  district  schools  in  the  county  and  many  others  in  process 
of  organization. 

The  principal  industries  are  lumbering,  agriculture,  fishing,  sawing,  dressing  and 
manufacturing  lumber  into  boxes,  sash  and  doors  for  eastern  shipment. 

Chippewa  is  a  great  county.  It  has  the  best  of  agricultural  and  timbered  lands,  a 
great  variety  of  soil,  fine  water  privileges,  good  society,  available  markets,  and  excel- 
lent shipping  facilities.  The  attention  of  the  immigrant  has  been  turned  in  this 
direction,  and  its  rapid  development  is  an  assured  fact. 


BY   OTTO   FOWLE. 

Chippewa  county  lies  at  the  extreme  eastern  end  of  the  upper  peninsula,  extend- 
ing from  Lake  Huron  on  the  south  to  Lake  Superior  on  the  north,  and  from  the 
St.  Mary  river  on  the  east,  including  several  islands  still  east  of  this,  westward  to  range 
eight  west  of  Michigan  meridian;  it  contains,  including  fractional,  a  total  of  fifty -five 
surveyed  townships,  or  approximately  1.600  square  miles.  This  is  all  now  remain- 
ing of  the  county  which  once  comprised  the  greater  part  of  the  upper  peninsula 
of  Michigan,  northern  Wisconsin  and  most  of  the  state  of  Minnesota. 

The  industries  of  the  county  are  greatly  diversified,  including  agriculture,  manu- 
facturing and  fishing.  The  principal  agricultural  products  being  wheat,  oats,  rye, 
peas,  of  which  a  large  amount  and  of  a  superior  quality  is  raised;  several  large 
seed  firms  having  warehouses  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  the  county  seat,  are  obtaining 
a  fine  quality  and  large  quantities  of  seed  peas.  Potatoes,  turnips,  parsnips,  beets, 
carrots,  squashes  and  pumpkins  yield  abundantly  and  of  tine  quality,  while  garden 
stuffs  of  all  kinds  are  easily  produced.  Timothy,  clover,  red  top  and  many  of  the 
wild  grasses  yield  large  cuts  of  hay  and  afford  excellent  pasturage.  Horses,  sheep, 
cattle,  hogs  and  poultry  are  raised  to  a  considerable  extent.  Chippewa  county 
mutton  stands  the  favorite  in  the  local  markets  over  anything  imported  from  the 
south  and  west  Of  wheat,  both  spring  and  winter  are  raised;  the  latter  has  lately 
obtained  the  preference.  While  farming  is  still  in  its  infancy  here,  Chippewa 
county  has  twice  taken  the  premium  on  wheat  at  the  State  fair.  Corn,  on 
account  of   early  frosts,   is   not   attempted,   excepting  garden   varieties. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is,  in  the  most,  quite  level,  varying  about  the  streams 
from  light  rolling  to  decidedly  hilly;  good  drainage  is  everywhere  admissible.  The 
soil  varies  from  lighty  sandy  to  heavy  clay,  while  loam  tracts  are  abundant. 
_  All  small  fruits  are  easily  raised,  of  excellent  quality  and  good  yield.  Strawber- 
ries, currants  and  raspberries  especially  thrive.  Who  has  not  heard  of  Lake 
Superior  raspberry  jam?  Whortle  and  cranberries  are  shipped  in  large  quantities. 
Plums  are  prolific,  while  apples  with  care  can  be  raised. 

Lumbering  has  been  extensively  carried  on  in  this  county  for  several  years.  The 
pine  still  standing  is  estimated  at  one  thousand  million  feet,  about  one  hundred 
million  being  manufactured  annually.  Large  tracts  of  spruce  and  other  pulp  woods 
are  found,  of  which  twenty  thousand  cords  are  annually  gotten  out. 

Interspersed  with  the  pine  and  hemlock  throughout  the  county  are  extensive 
tracts  and  belts  of  excellent  hardwood.  Running  west  from  Waiskai  river,  the 
entire  length  of  the  county,  about  forty   miles,  is   a  belt  of  hardwood  from  sixteen 


224  Michigan  and  its  Kesoukces. 

to  twenty  miles  wide,  composed  of  beech,  birch  and  maple;  the  maple  is  of  superior 
quality  running  largely  to  bird's-eye,  and  grows  large  and  thrifty.  The  birch  is 
remarkable  for  its  richness  in  color  and  grows  very  plentifully.  This  hardwood  is 
found  in  smaller  tracts  on  most  of  the  islands  and  interspersed  throughout  the 
main  land.  The  low  lands  and  river  bottoms  have  a  heavy  growth  of  poplar  and 
spruce,  while  cedar  is  abundant.  It  is  estimated  that  not  more  than  one-third  of 
the  hardwood  has  been  cut.  The  greater  part  of  the  county  can  be  classed  as 
unimproved,  and  varies  from  $1.50  to  $6.00  per  acre  in  value.  It  is  estimated  that 
of  improved  lands  there  are  about  25,000  acres  valued  at  from  $600  to  $20.00  per 
acre  while  the  farms  near  the  Sault  run  as  high  as  $100.00  per  acre.  Much  of  the 
improvement  is  well  and  thoroughly  done,  good  fences  and  buildings,  while  the 
latest  farm  machinery  is  extensively  used. 

The  manufactures  are  mostly  of  lumber  and  its  products.  At  Sault  Ste.  Marie 
and  Bay  Mills  are  extensive  planing,  sash,  door  and  box  factories.  At  Sault 
Ste.  Marie  are  first  class  machine  shops  and  foundries,  while  brick  of  good  quality 
are  extensively  manufactured. 

The  chief  streams  of  the  county,  after  the  St.  Mary,  the  outlet  of  Lake  Superior, 
on  which  the  United  States  government  locks  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie  are  situated  are 
the  Taquahmenon,  Waishkai,  and  Monoskong.  none  of  the  latter  being  navigable, 
except  for  light  tugs  and  flat  boats,  but  affording  excellent  facilities  for  transport- 
ing timber,  pulp,  wood  and  cedar. 

There  are  no  mines  in  the  county.  Stone  quarries  are  extensively  worked  at 
Drummond  Island  where  the  backing  stone  for  the  government  lock  and  building 
stone  is  taken. 

Sault  Ste.  Marie  is  the  chief  city,  situated  at  the  rapids  of  the  St.  Mary  river. 
It  has  a  population  of  7,000  and  is  sustaining  a  substantial  growth.  It  is  the  depot 
of  supplies  for  the  entire  county  and  much  beside.  Here  are  the  famous  govern- 
ment locks,  through  which  passes  the  entire  Lake  Superior  commerce,  the  tonnage 
of  1892  being  over  11,000,000  tons. 

The  money  expended  by  the  government  to  complete  the  work  now  projected, 
with  that  already  spent,  will  approximate  $10,000,000.  The  operation  of  the  canal 
affords  labor  for  a  large  force  and  is  an  inportant  factor  in  sustaining  the  city. 
Fuel  and  food  supplies  for  the  boats  afford  a  large  trade  which  insures  good  prices 
to  the  farmers  for  their  products.  The  government  is  also  constructing  the  build- 
ings for  a  military  post  at  a  cost  of  about  $350,000  to  take  the  place  of  old  Fort 
Brady  established  in  1822.  When  completed  this,  it  is  conceded,  will  be  one  of  the 
finest  posts  in  the  Union. 

The  fall  of  the  St.  Mary  at  this  point  is  eighteen  feet,  thus  affording  one  of  the 
best  water  powers  in  the  country.  Of  this  the  Chandler  Dunbar  Water  Power  Co. 
has  utilized  about  10,000  horse  power,  with  which  it  lights  the  ciry,  runs  many 
electric  motors,  and  proposes  to  pump  the  city  water.  Negotiations  are  pending  by 
which  a  large  pulp  and  flouring  mill  are  to  be  located  on  their  site.  Running  through 
the  city  from  above  the  falls  to  Little  Rapids  extends  the  canal  of  the  St.  Mary's 
Falls  Water  Power  Co.,  on  which  $400,000  has  been  expended,  and  when  completed 
to  the  proposed  dimensions  will  afford  30,000  horse  power.  One  hundred  acres  for 
mill  sites  on  the  river  front  is  owned  by  this  company,  which  when  in  operation 
will  have  facilities  afforded  for  having  railway  tracks  and.  docks  adjacent  to  the 
mills.  There  are  at  present  three  railways  in  operation  at  this  point,  the  "Soo" 
line,  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic,  and  the  Canadian  Pacific,  all  of  which  have 
an  interest  in  the  international  bridge  across  the  St.  Mary. 

Fish  and  game  are  abundant.  The  commercial  fish  include  whitefish,  herring, 
sturgeon,  pickerel  and  lake  trout.  The  fish  annually  shipped  from  this  point,  mostly 
whitefish  and  lake  trout,  is  about  2,200  tons,  valued  at  $231,000.  The  game  fish 
are  brook  trout  and  bass,  and  are  taken  in  large  numbers. 

The  large  game  consists  of  deer,  bear,  wolves,  foxes,  lynx,  and  many  fur-bearing 
animals  such  as  otter,  beaver,  muskrat,  skunk  and  rabbit.  Of  birds,  partridges 
and  ducks  are  most  abundant. 

CLARE    COUNTY. 

Clare  county  was  organized  in  1871.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Missaukee 
and  Roscommon,  on  the  east  by  Gladwin,  on  the  south  by  Isabella  and  on  the  west 
by  Osceola.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of 
7,553.  Harrison,  a  town  of  800  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the 
country  is  gently  rolling,  with  some  hilly  sections  in  the  center  of  the  county.      It 


Michigan  by  Counties.  225 

is  well  watered  by  small  streams,  inland  lakes  and  spring  brooks.  At  Farwell  and 
Clare  a  small  water  power  is  afforded  by  the  Tobacco  river  which  might  be  used 
to  run  several  mills.  The  swamps  are  mostly  cedar  and  ash,  and  are  easily  drained. 
A  number  of  townships  have  a  light,  sandy  soil  with  a  clay  subsoil.  A  large  part 
of  the  county,  however,  has  a  good  clay  soil. 

Pine,  hemlock,  beech,  maple,  basswood  and  elm  comprise  the  principal  varieties 
of  timber.  The  crops  are  mainly  wheat,  hay  and  potatoes.  Oats  are  successfully 
grown  in  some  townships.  The  county  being  new,  fruit  raising  has  not  as 
yet  had  a  fair  test.  There  are,  however,  thrifty  young  orchards  which  give  prom- 
ise of  bearing  large  crops  in  the  near  future.  The  cost  of  clearing  averages  $20 
per  acre.     There  are  convenient  wood  markets  all  along  the  line  of  the  railroads. 

There  is  6,497  acres  of  State  and  Government  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry. 
There  are  large  tracts  of  unimproved  lands  in  the  market,  which  can  be  had  at 
from  $S  to  $10  per  acre,  while  improved  farms  range  from  S15  to  $60.  There  are  also 
large  quantities  of  stump  lands,  which  will  eventually  make  good  farms,  and  which 
are  held  at  from  50  cents  to  $6  and  $7  per  acre. 

There  are  two  State  roads  in  the  county,  one  running  north  from  Farwell  to 
Houghton  lake,  and  the  other  running  north  and  east  from  Clare  to  Gladwin. 
The  local  roads  are  generally  in  a  fair  condition.  Snow  falls  by  December  1,  and 
attains  a  depth  of  from  12  to  18  inches.  The  ground  does  not  freeze  to  a  great 
depth,  and  spring  work  usually  begins  by  April  15. 

The  schools  are  fair,  considering  the  newness  of  the  county.  At  the  villages 
along  the  line  of  the  railroads  they  are  very  good  indeed. 

The  industries  are  lumbering  and  agriculture.  Labor  is  always  in  good  demand, 
particularly  in  the  lumber  woods,  wages  ranging  from  $2.3  to  $30  per  month  with 
board.  The  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  railroad  and  T.  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  railway  and  its 
branches  cross  the  county,  affording  a  good  outlet  for  its  vast  lumber  resources. 

CLINTON  COUNTY. 

BY   R.    M.    WINSTON,    ST.    JOHNS,    MICH. 

Clinton  county  was  organized  in  1839.  It  is  bounded  on*  the  north  by  Gratiot, 
on  the  east  by  Shiawassee,  on  the  south  by  Eaton  and  Ingham,  and  on  the  west 
by  Ionia.  It  has  an  area  of  five  hundred  and  seventy-six  square  miles,  and  a  popula- 
tion in  1890  of  26,509.  St.  Johns,  a  thriving  town  of  3,132  inhabitants,  is  the  county 
seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  gently  rolling  and  is  well  watered  by  the 
Lookingglass,  Maple  and  Grand  rivers,  and  many  small  brooks  flowing  into  them. 
The  swamp  lands  are  well  drained.  Through  the  center  of  the  county  east  and  west 
the  soil  is  a  rich  clay  loam.  North  and  south  of  the  central  belt  there  are  belts  of 
excellent  sandy  and  gravelly  loam.  The  greater  part  of  the  county  was  embraced 
in  the  heavily  timbered  land  and  timber  openings,  the  open  land  or  "prairies"  being 
generally  of  small  expanse.  The  lands  from  which  heavy  timber  has  been  cleared 
are  generally  strongest  and  best.  There  is,  however,  but  little  poor  soil  in  the 
county. 

The  prevailing  varieties  of  timber  are  oak,  maple,  basswood,  beech,  ash,  hickory, 
elm  and  walnut.  The  forests  are  being  preserved  for  farm  use  and  but  little  lum- 
bering will  be  done  in  the  future. 

The  Detroit,  Grand  Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee  railroad  crosses  the  county  from  east  to 
west  while  the  Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern,  Jackson.  Lansing  &amp;  Saginaw  and  the 
Toledo,  Ann  Arbor  &amp;  Northern  Michigan  cross  the  southwestern,  southeastern  and 
northeastern  portions  of  the  county  respectively. 

Agricultural  products  peculiar  to  this  latitude  can  be  successfully  produced  in 
Clinton  county,  and  it  is  a  matter  of  record  that  Clinton  county  has  raised  in  one 
year,  more  wheat  than  any  other  county  of  equal  area  in  the  United  States.  Oats, 
corn,  barley  and  potatoes  are  also  successfully  grown;  and  from  the  reclaimed 
swamp  lands,  bountiful  crops  of  garden  products  and  hay  are  produced.  Apples,  pears, 
peaches,  plums,  berries  and  grapes  do  well.  The  apple  crop  is  becoming  an  impor- 
tant source  of  income.  Good  lands  with  a  fair  improvement  are  held  at  from  $30 
to  $40  per  acre,  while  farms  with  excellent  buildings,  good  fences,  etc.,  are  held  at 
from  $40  to  $50  per  acre;  some  farms  near  railroad  towns  bring  $75  per  acre.  These 
farms  are  near  good  markets  reached  by  roads  unsurpassed  by  those  of  any  county 
in  the  State. 

Every  part  of  the  county  is  well  supplied  with  schools  and  churches,  the  rural 
schools  being  well  graded  and  provided  with  a  uniform  course  of  study;  the  teachers 

29 


226  Michigan  and  its  Eesoukces. 

are  enthusiastic  and  competent.  In  the  villages  are  excellent  graded  and  Union 
schools. 

Stock  raising  is  an  important  industry,  and  farmers  are  taking  great  interest  in 
improving  their  horses,  cattle,  sheep  and  swine  by  purchasing  and  importing  stock 
for  breeding  purposes.  It  is  undoubtedly  a  fact  that  farmers  are  making  more  money 
from  stock  than  from  grain  products.  We  now  have  five  creameries  and  two  cheese 
factories  in  active  operation.  One  mercantile  firm  in  St.  Johns  alone  purchased 
last  year  butter  and  eggs  to  the  amount  of  $60,000.  A  dealer  in  eggs  purchased 
and  shipped  270,000  dozen,  valued  at  $50,000.  These  facts  from  two  firms  show  the 
importance  of    our  small  industries. 

Manufacturing  is  also  quite  an  important  industry,  St.  Johns  claiming  the  largest 
exclusive  table  factory  in  the  world,  the  firm  carrying  a  stock  of  hardwood  lumber  of 
9,000,000  feet.     The  Ovid  carriage  works  are  also  well  known. 

The  merchants  carry  large  stocks  of  goods,  one  firm  doing  a  business  of  over 
$200,000  sales  in  1892. 

The  inhabitants  are  principally  of  American  descent  except  in  the  townships  in 
the   west   central  part   where   an   industrious  German  population  can  be  found. 

For  miles  one  may  travel  through  Clinton  county  and  see  a  succession  of  well 
cultivated  farms  with  neatly  painted  and  constructed  farm  buildings,  showing  con- 
clusively that  the  people  are  industrious,  intelligent  and  live  in  a  county  second 
to  none  in  such  material  resources  as  a  fei'tile  soil,  mild  climate,  and  good  markets 
can  give. 

CRAWFORD    COUNTY. 

BY    E.    HANSON,   GRAYLING,   MICH. 

The  principal  industry  of  Crawford  county  is  lumbering,  largely  in  the  logs 
put  into  the  Manistee  and  Au  Sable  rivers.  Manufacturing  into  lumber  is  also 
carried  on  at  the  principal  town  of  the  county,  Grayling,  which  is  also  the  county 
seat;  also  a  small  amount  at  Frederic  and  Roscommon,  making  a  total  of  about 
seventy-five  millions  a  year  manufactured,  and  the  probable  amount  of  logs  as 
much  more. 

Geographically  the  county  is  located  on  the  head  waters  of  two  of  the  finest 
rivers  in  the  State,  starting  a  few  miles  north  of  the  county.  These  two  rivers 
run  parallel  for  a  distance  of  nearly  twelve  miles,  only  one  and  one-half  to  three 
miles  apart,  then  dividing,  one,  the  Manistee,  flowing  toward  the  west  and  empty- 
ing into  Lake  Michigan,  and  the  other  turning  toward  the  east,  emptying  into 
Lake  Huron. 

As  to  agriculture  considerable  has  been  done,  and  all  kinds  of  grain  raised,  but 
owing  to  the  cold  and  late  frost,  is  not  generally  considered  a  success. 

The  soil  is  light  and  sandy,  beipg  open  plains  or  covered  with  pine  largely, 
except  two  towns  in  the  northwest  corner,  which  is  hardwood,  such  as  beech, 
maple,  basswood  and  birch.  About  two-thirds  of  the  wood  lands  of  the  county  are 
cut.  The  unimproved  land  is  worth  50  cents  per  acre,  and  the  improved  land  $20 
to  $30  per  acre.  On  both  the  Manistee  and  Au  Sable  there  are  some  splendid 
water  powers  undeveloped.  Both  the  Manistee  and  Au  Sable  abound  with  the 
celebrated  grayling  fish  and  also  trout,  and  game  of  all  kinds  inhabit  this  region, 
it  being  comparatively  a  wilderness  yet,  such  as  bears,  wolves,  deer  and  other  wild 
beasts  of  the  forest. 

Schools  and  churches  will  compare  favorably  with  any  part  of  the  State.  At 
Grayling,  the  county  seat,  we  have  a  high  school  with  six  teachers,  and  some  of 
our  graduates  have  gone  direct  to  the  University  from  here.  One  graduate  from 
this  school  passed  examination  for  West  Point  successfully,  in  competition  with 
over  forty  others  in  this  district,  and  schools  in  other  parts  of  the  county  are 
excellent. 

We  have  four  churches  at  Grayling,  and  several  others  in  other  parts  of  the 
county,  all  prosperous  and  doing  good  work.  The  Michigan  Central  Railroad  and 
its  branches  passes  through  the  county  north  and  south. 

Wages  paid  for  common  labor  $1.50  per  day;    skilled  labor  from  $2  to  $6  per  day. 

DELTA    COUNTY. 

Delta  county  was  organized  in  1861.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  and  east  by 
Schoolcraft,  on  the  south   by  Green   bay  and  Lake  Michigan  and  on   the  west  by 


Michigan   by   Counties.  227 

Menominee  and  Marquette.  It  has  an  area  of  1,152  square  miles  and  a  population 
in  1890  of  15,330.  Escanaba,  a  town  of  6,808  inhabitants,  situated  on  an  arm  of 
Green  bay,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  country  is  generally  level.  There  are  areas  of  rolling  land  along  the  rivers, 
nine  of  which  traverse  the  county  from  north  to  south.  The  soil  on  the  rolling 
lands  is  a  sandy  loam,  with  clay  subsoil  and  a  limestone  foundation;  on  the  plains 
it  is  sandy,  and  on  the  marshes  a  vegetable  loam  with  sandy  subsoil.  On  the  roll- 
ing lands  the  timber  is  principally  beech,  birch  and  maple,  on  the  plains  pine 
abounds,  while  in  the  swamps  cedar  and  tamarack  are  found  in  large  quantities. 
The  principal  crops  are  wheat,  oats,  all  the  grasses,  potatoes,  and  garden  vegeta- 
bles of  the  hardier  sorts.  No  fruit  is  grown,  although  apples  might  be  successfully 
grown  upon  the  clay  soil.  The  cost  of  clearing  varies.  Swamps  are  the  most 
expensive  clearing,  hardwood  and  pine  lands  costing  less,  with  good  wood  markets 
at  the  towns  and  charcoal  furnaces. 

There  were  subject  to  entry  in  1890,04,064  acres  of  land.  Unimproved  lands  near 
the  settlements  can  be  purchased  at  -from  $3  to  $8  per  acre,  while  improved  farms - 
are  proportionately  higher.  "Stump  lands"  are  held  at  from  50  cents  to  $2  per 
acre.  A  State  road  traverses  the  county  from  north  to  south,  but  is  neglected  and 
but  little  used.  It  passes  through  Escanaba,  and  connects  Green  bay  with 
Marquette.     Another  extends  from  l3ays  river  to  Manistique  in  Schoolcraft  county. 

Snow  falls  in  November,  and  averages  from  three  to  four  feet  in  depth.  The 
ground  freezes  quite  deep,  and  spring  work  cannot  be  begun  before  May  1.  The 
schools  are  in  a  very  creditable  condition  for  a  comparatively  new  county.  Lurn- 
bering  and  fishing  are  the  principal  industries,  although  the  charcoal  business  is. 
extensively  carried  on  along  the  line  of  the  railway.  Labor  is  not  in  good  demand 
save  in  the  lumber  camps.  Immigrants  with  limited  means  VA'ill  find  this  county 
a  good  field  for  agricultural  development.  The  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern  Railroad 
passes  through  the  county.  Escanaba  has  been  and  is  still  the  leading  iron  port 
in  the  land.  It  has  a  magnificent  harbor,  and  it  is  claimed  to  be  the  largest  ore 
shipping  port  in  the  world,  and  is  destined  to  become  one  of  the  leading  manu- 
facturing and  business  centers  in  northwestern  Michigan. 

DICKINSON  COUNTY. 

Dickinson  county  was  organized  in  1891  from  Iron,  Marquette  and  Menominee. 
It  has  a  population  of  about  16,000  and  has  an  area  of  491,917  acres.  Iron  Mount- 
ain is  the  county  seat  and  had  a  population  in  1891  of  8,559.  The  principal  interests 
are  mining  and  lumbering,  some  of  the  largest  iron  mines  in  the  Menominee  range 
being  here,  namely,  the  great  Chapin,  Pewabic,  Ludington,  Hamilton  or  Aragon, 
East  and  West  Vulcan,  and  several  others.  The  amount  of  iron  ore  produced  by 
these  mines  from  1878  to  December  31,  1892,  was  about  11,000,000  tons,  which  was 
shipped  by  rail  to  Escanaba  and  thence  by  lake  to  Cleveland  and  Ashtabula,  Ohio. 
The  lands  generally  are  unimproved  and  heavily  timbered,  principally  pine,  hemlock, 
cedar,  maple  and  birch,  about  three-fourths  of  which  remains  uncut.  The  soil 
is  sandy  loam  and  adapted  to  oats  and  vegetables  of  all  kinds,  particularly  potatoes. 
The  value  of  improved  lands,  about  the  sixteenth  of  the  total,  is  $8  to  $10  per  acre, 
and  the  average  value  of   unimproved  lands  is  $2.50  per  acre. 

Lumber  and  shingles  are  manufactured  at  Norway,  Sagold,  Metropolitan,  Foster 
City.     About   100,000,000  feet   board   measure   is   cut   annually. 

The  principal  rivers  are  the  Menominee,  Michigamme  and  Sturgeon,  not  navigable 
on  account  of  the  numerous  rapids  and  falls  which  afford  abundance  of  water  power, 
very  little  developed  as  yet.  There  is  one  pulp  mill  and  one  hydraulic  power  works 
which  furnishes  the  power  that  operates  the  machinery  of  the  Chapin  mine,  which 
is  conveyed  in  iron  pipes  a  distance  of  two  and  one-half  miles.  The  principal  mar- 
kets are   Chicago  and  Milwaukee. 

The  schools  and  school  buildings  are  among  the  best  in  the  State.  At  Iron  Mount- 
ain the  school  building  is  of  gray  granite,  costing  $40,000.  There  are  numerous 
churches,  nearly  all  denominations  having  places  of  worship.  There  are  three 
railroads,  namely,  the  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern,  Milwaukee  &amp;  Northern,  and  the 
Escanaba,  Iron  Mountain  &amp;  Western,  the  latter  exclusively  used  for  carrying  ore. 

Wages  for  woodsmen  from  $18  to  $35  per  month,  common  labor  $1.40  to  $1.60, 
skilled,  $2.50  to  $4.50  per  day. 

Small  lakes  and  streams  are  numerous  and  abound  in  fish,  principally  speckled 
trout,  black  bass,  pickerel,  wall-eyed  pike  and  perch.  Deer  are  quite  numerous, 
and  by  the  strict  enforcement  of   the  new  game  law  are  increasing  every  year.

EATON  COUNTY. 

Eaton  county  was  organized  in  1837.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Ionia  and 
Clinton,  on  the  east  by  Ingham,  on  the  south  by  Jackson  and  Calhoun,  and  on 
the  west  by  Barry.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in 
1890  of  32,094.  Charlotte,  a  flourishing  town  of  3,867  inhabitants,  is  the  county 
seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  generally  rolling,  with  small  prairies  or  plains  in 
some  parts.  Grand  river  waters  the  four  eastern  townships.  Battle  creek  and  its 
tributaries  the  central  and  northwestern  towns,  and  the  Thornapple  the  northern, 
central  and  western  towns.     The  first  named  streams  furnish  good  water  powers. 

All  varieties  of  soil  may  be  found.  The  subsoil  is  generally  clay.  The  township 
of  Bellevue  has  a  limestone  subsoil.  In  the  central  parts  of  the  county  a  gravelly 
subsoil  is  found  in  a  few  townships. 

The  timber  is  principally  oak,  beech,  maple,  elm,  ash,  hickory,  walnut,  whitewood 
and  tamarack.  The  principal  crops  are  wheat,  oats,  corn,  potatoes  and  barley. 
Maple  sugar  is  made  in  large  quantities.  Fruit  does  well,  apples,  grapes  and 
berries  of  all  descriptions  being  especially  successful,  while  peaches  are  raised  in 
small  quantities.  The  cost  of  clearing  ranges  from  $12  to  $20  per  acre.  There  are 
good   wood  markets  in   all   of    the  villages. 

There  are  no  government  or  State  lands  of  any  value  in  the  market.  Scarcely 
any  unimproved  lands  can  be  had,  as  such  land  is  retained  by  the  farmers  for 
its  timber.  Improved  farms  are  held  at  from  $30  to  $50  per  acre.  The  roads 
of   the   county   are   all   good. 

Snow  falls  by  December  1,  the  average  depth  during  the  season  reaching  fif- 
teen inches,  the  ground  freezing  to  the  same  depth.  Farmers  plow  in  April. 
The  schools  are  good  and  rapidly  improving.  Olivet  college,  a  Congregational 
institution   at  the   town  of   the   same   name,  is   in   a  flourishing   condition. 

Agriculture  is  the  principal  industry.  There  is  some  lumbering  and  tie-cutting, 
also  considerable  lime  burned  at  Bellevue.  There  is  no  special  demand  for 
labor,  unless  perchance  in  the  summer  season.  The  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk, 
Grand  Rapids  division  of  the  Michigan  Central  and  the  Lansing  branch  of  the 
Michigan  Southern  railroads  cross  the  county  in  difl'erent  directions,  affording 
excellent   market   privileges. 

Eaton  county  is  a  rich  agricultural  county,  and  most  of  its  inhabitants  are 
thrifty,  well-to-do  citizens. 

EMMET  COUNTY. 

BY  J.  C.  BONTECOU,  PETOSKEY,  MICH. 

Emmet  county  was  organized  in  1853.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  the  Straits 
of  Mackinac,  on  the  east  by  Cheboygan,  on  the  south  by  Charlevoix  and  Little 
Traverse  bay,  on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan.  It  has  an  area  of  414  square  miles, 
and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  8,756.  Harbor  Springs,  a  beautifully  located  town  of 
1,000  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  Petoskey,  a  town  of  4,000  inhabitants,  located 
across  the  bay  from  Harbor  Springs,  is  the  most  important  town  in  the  county.  The 
surface  of  the  county  might  be  termed  rolling.  There  are  some  townships  which  are 
level,  others  are  rolling,  while  certain  portions  of  the  county  are  very  hilly.  A 
large  part  of  the  county  is  well  watered  by  creeks,  spring  brooks  and  lakes,  while 
but  a  small  portion  is  without  water.  Bear  creek  which  flows  into  Little  Traverse 
bay  at  Petoskey,  has  fine  water  powers  for  some  distance  back  from  its  mouth, 
now  fully  utilized  for  manufacturing  purposes.  The  soil  is  variable.  In  some 
localities  will  be  found  a  patch  of  sandy  or  gravelly  loam,  with  or  without  clay 
subsoil.  In  others  a  patch  of  clay  loam,  alternating  with  a  patch  of  sandy  loam 
or  limestone  sand  with  a  sandy  subsoil.  As  a  rule  the  soil  is  very  productive  in 
all  parts  of  the  county.  Sugar  maple,  beech,  birch,  hemlock,  cedar,  pine,  elm,  ash, 
and  basswood  timber  is  found  in  quantities  throughout  the  county. 

Wheat  and  all  grain  crops,  with  the  exception  of  some  varieties  of  corn,  are  grown 
successfully.  Early  corn  does  well,  as  does  the  late  Dent  variety.  Grass  in  nearly  all 
its  varieties,  is  a  productive  crop.    Potatoes  and  all  root  crops  also  yield  bountifully. 

Fruit  growing  is  yet  in  its  infancy,  but  a  large  acreage  has  been  planted  with  apple' 
pear,  plum,  and  cherry  trees.  All  these  fruits  do  finely,  especially  all  varieties  of 
the  plum,  which  is  here  a  perfect  fruit,  and  gives  a  marvelous  yield.  Small  fruits  also 
do  well,  especially  the  raspberry  and  strawberry. 


'230  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

The  timber  is  generally  heavy,  and  the  cost  of  clearing  averages  about  $20  per 
acre.     The  villages  afford  a  fair  market  for  wood. 

There  are  4,000  acres  of  government  and  State  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry. 
Unimproved  lands  are  held  at  from  |5  to  $20  per  acre,  while  improved  lands  range 
from  $15  to  $50. 

There  are  fine  State  roads  in  the  county,  and  the  townships  are  now  well  supplied 
with  roads  which  are  being  greatly  improved  each  year. 

Snow  falls  by  December  1,  the  average  depth  attained  during  the  winter  being 
about  twenty  inches.  The  winters  are  very  steady.  The  ground  does  not  freeze 
to  any  depth,  and  plowing  can  always  be  undertaken  in  April.  The  schools  are 
in  good  condition  and  compare  favorably  with  those  in  the  older  portions  of  the 
State.     Excellent  graded  schools  can  be  found  at  Petoskey  and  Harbor  Springs. 

There  is  very  little  pine  in  the  county,  but  hardwood,  hemlock  and  cedar  lum- 
bering is  a  heavy  industry  on  Maple  river,  Carp  river,  Bear  creek,  Birch,  Pickard 
and  Crooked  lakes,  also  along  the  line  of  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroad. 
Tanbark  is  also  shipped  in  large  quantities.  Lime,  lumber,  handles,  wood  pulp, 
ties,  posts,  telegraph  poles,  woodenware  and  leather  are  shipped  in  large  quantities  by 
rail  and  by  vessel.  The  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroad  crosses  the  county  on 
its  way  to  Mackinac,  and  a  branch  extends  from  Petoskey  to  Harbor  Springs.  The 
Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan  railroad  now  terminates  at  Petoskey  but  will  eventually 
run  to  the  Straits  of  Mackinac.  It  connects  Emmet  county  with  Charlevoix,  Bellaire, 
Elk  Rapids  and  Traverse  City,  besides  giving  through  fast  trains  to  Grand  Rapids, 
Detroit   and  Chicago. 

Little  Traverse  bay  and  the  resorts  along  its  banks,  have  become  famous,  owing 
to  wonderful  climatic  advantages.  Petoskey,  Bay  View,  Wequetonsing,  Harbor 
Springs  and  Harbor  Point,  are  thronged  every  season  with  tourists  in  search  of 
health  or  pleasure,  and  the  Summer  Assembly  and  Summer  University  at  Bay 
View  is  now  second  alone  to  Chautauqua,  both  in  attendance  and  the  extent  of  its 
programs  and  curriculum. 

GENESEE  COUNTY. 

Genesee  county  was  organized  in  1836.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Tuscola  and 
Saginaw,  on  the  east  by  Lapeer,  on  the  south  by  Livingston  and  Oakland,  and  on  the 
west  by  Shiawassee  and  Saginaw.  It  has  an  area  of  648  square  miles,  and  had,  in  1890, 
a  population  of  39,430.  Flint,  a  flourishing  city  of  9,803  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 
The  State  institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  is  located  in  the  suburbs  of  this  city. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  comparatively  level,  although  a  few  townships  are  quite 
rolling.  It  is  well  watered  by  the  Flint  and  Shiawassee  rivers,  the  Thread  and  Swartz 
creeks,  and  by  several  smaller  streams.  Several  fine  water  powers  are  found  in  differ- 
ent parts  of  the  county.  There  are  several  inland  lakes  of  considerable  size,  notably 
Long  lake  in  Fenton  township,  which  is  famed  for  its  beautiful  shores,  and  has  become 
during  the  last  few  years  a  pleasure  resort  of  considerable  prominence. 

The  soil  of  the  southern  townships  is  a  sandy  gravel,  such  as  is  usually  found  in  oak 
openings,  with  a  clay  loam  on  the  lower  lands.  The  rest  of  the  county  has  a  clay  loam 
with  a  clay  subsoil  in  most  localities.  The  timber  remaining  is  mainly  oak,  beech, 
maple,  elm,  and  basswood. 

Genesee  is  emphatically  a  representative  county  when  its  grain  producing  qualities 
are  taken  into  consideration.  Corn,  wheat,  oats,  barley,  and  in  short  any  grain  that 
can  be  grown  in  this  latitude,  do  remarkably  well  with  proper  attention.  Wheat  in 
particular  is  regarded  as  a  sure  crop,  and  will  average  one  year  with  another,  25  bushels 
to  the  acre.  The  cultivation  of  fruit  has  been  well  tested.  Apples  are  grown  and 
shipped  in  large  quantities.  Few  peaches  are  raised,  but  grapes,  cherries,  and  all  sorts 
of  berries  grow  to  great  perfection. 

There  are  no  government  or  State  lands  of  any  description  in  the  market.  Even  the 
pine  stump  lands  have  been  improved,  and  are  held  at  from  $15  to  $25  per  acre. 
Improved  farms  range  from  $30  to  $100.  The  roads  of  the  county  are  all  good,  the 
long-constructed  State  roads  being  no  better  than  the  ordinary  township  roads. 

Snow  falls  in  December,  and  sleighing  often  lasts  two  months.  The  ground  freezes 
to  an  average  depth  of  ten  inches.    Plowing  usually  begins  by  April  1. 

The  country  and  village  schools  are  among  the  finest  in  the  State.  The  high  school 
at  Flint  is  one  of  the  few  schools  from  which  students  are  admitted  to  the  University 
without  further  examination,  and  has  a  very  large  resident  and  non-resident  attendance. 

Lumbering,  once  the  principal  industry,  is  looked  upon  as  a  thing  of  the  past, 
although  some  logs  are  now  cut  in  different  parts  of  the  county,  and  considerable 


Michigan  by  Counties.  231 

sawing  is  yet  done.  Agriculture  and  manufacturing  are  now  the  recognized  industries. 
Among  its  many  manufactories  are  to  be  noticed  extensive  wagon  works,  woolen  and 
cotton  mills,  charcoal  works,  machine  shops,  foundries,  flouring  mills,  shoe,  cigar, 
pickle,  and  agricultural  implement  factories,  all  of  which  employ  a  large  number  of 
men.  Labor  is  in  fair  demand  on  farms  during  the  summer  season;  but  there  is 
usually  an  over  supply  of  this  commodity  during  the  winter  months. 

The  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette,  its  Otter  Lake  division,  the  Detroit  &amp;  Milwaukee,  and 
the  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk  railroads  furnish  the  outlets  for  the  marketable  pro- 
ductions of  this  county. 

Genesee  is  rapidly  becoming  one  of  the  wealthies  counties  in  the  State,  and  is  receiv- 
ing large  accessions  to  its  population  annually  from  all  points  of  the  compass. 

The  following  is  from  Hon.  Josiah  W.  Begole,  Ex-Governor  of  Michigan: 

Flint  Mich.,  May  3,  1893. 

I  am  just  in  receipt  of  your  circular  asking  me  to  give  you  the  present  history  of 
Genesee  county.  In  reply  will  say  that  I  have  carefully  compared  the  old  com- 
pilation of  Genesee  county  with  its  present  condition.  Her  present  and  past 
condition  is  and  has  been  a  flattering  one.  Large  improvements  have  been 
made  in  most  everything,  that  pertains  to  Genesee  county.  Her  cities,  towns, 
and  villages  are  all  growing  and  prosperous.  There  are  no  more  woods  in  our 
county  except  small  patches  that  the  most  of  our  farmers  have  left  for  wood  lo*:s;  all 
of  our  lands  are  improved.  We  have  but  few  small  lakes  and  no  swamps.  Nearly  all  is 
good  land  and  that  is  the  greatest  source  of  our  prosperity.  We  have  three  good 
saw-mills  now  running  successfully,  in  Flint.  The  logs  are  mostly  brought  from  the 
north  part  ot  the  State.  There  is  but  very  little  rolling  land  in  our  county  and  good 
drainage  everywhere.  In  addition  to  those  mentioned  in  the  old  compilation  we  have 
four  large  and  prosperous  carriage  and  wagon  factories  in  Flint,  three  of  which  I  know 
turn  out  one  thousand  dollars  worth  of  goods  each  and  every  day.  I  came  to  this  town 
when  it  was  an  unbroken  wilderness,  in  the  summer  of  1836,  the  year  that  both  the 
State  and  county  were  organized,  though  the  State  was  not  received  into  the  grand 
union  of  states  until  in  the  winter  of  1837.     I  have  the  honor  to  be 

Truly  yours,

GLADWIN  COUNTY. 
BY    EUGENE   FOSTEE,    GLADWIN. 

Gladwin  county  was  organized  in  1875.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Roscom- 
mon and  Ogemaw,  on  the  east  by  Bay,  on  the  south  by  Midland,  and  on  the  west 
by  Clare.  It  has  an  area  of  504  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of 
4,208.     Gladwin,  a  village  of  about  100  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  eastern  and  southern  portions  of  the  county  are  level,  while  the  northern 
and  western  parts  are  quite  rolling.  The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Tittaba- 
wassee,  Molasses,  Tobacco,  and  Cedar  rivers  and  their  smaller  tributaries.  There 
are  a  number  of  available  water  powers  on  the  above  streams.  Good  arable  land 
is  found  throughout  the  entire  county,  although  in  the  northwestern  corner  and  in 
the  eastern  center  of  the  county  the  soil  is  rather  light.  The  timber  is  pine, 
hemlock,  cedar,  oak,  ash,  elm,  beech,  maple,  basswood,  ironwood,  poplar,  wild  cherry, 
and  butternut.  All  sorts  of  crops  are  raised  successfully.  The  soil  is  especially 
well  adapted  to  the  raising  of  clover  and  timothy.  Fruit  growing  is  as  yet  in  its 
infancy;  all  kinds  of  berries,  however  are  found  in  abundance.  The  cost  of  clearing 
averages  from  SIO  to  $20  per  acre,  with  a  good  market  for  wood. 

There  are  no  government  lands  in  the  market,  but  there  were  subject  to  entry 
January  1.  1893,  392  acres  of  State  swamp,  775  acres  of  primary  school,  and  some 
Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  railroad  lands.  Unimproved  lauds  are  held  at  from  $5 
to  $10  per  acre.  There  are  large  tracts  of  stump  land  that  can  be  had  at  a  low 
figure,  and  are  said  to  be  admirably  adapted  to  farming.  A  State  road  runs 
from  Midland  through  this  county  to  Houghton  lake,  and  thence  to  Grand 
Traverse.  There  is  also  a  State  road  from  Loomis  to  Gladwin,  and  one  from  Cole- 
man to  Gladwin.    The  other  roads  of  the  county  are  mainly  new. 

Snow  falls  by  December  1  and  may  last  until  April  1.  Every  alternate  winter 
less  snow  falls,  and  the  ground  freezes  to  some  depth.  Some  winter  potatoes  will 
keep  in  the  patch.

The  schools  are  good,  every  locality  supplied.  Lumbering  is  the  principal  industry 
and  labor  is  always  in  good  demand  in  the  camps,  wages  ranging  from  $20  to  $25 
per  month  with  board.  Lands  are  cheap  and  productive,  society  good,  and  the 
prospect  of  a  rapid  growth  very  favorable.  A  logging  road  has  been  built  by  the 
Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  Railroad  company,  extending  from  Coleman  a  short  dis- 
tance into  Gladwin  county.     It  will  eventually  reach  Gladwin. 

The  county  is  rapidly  developing  and  is  destined  to  be  one  of  the  most  prosper- 
ous counties  in  the  State. 

GOGEBIC   COUNTY. 
BY   W.   H.    DOYLE,   IRONWOOD, 

Gogebic  county  was  organized  in  1887.  It  is  the  most  northwesterly  county  in 
the  State,  and  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Lake  Superior  and  Ontonagon  county, 
on  the  east  by  Iron  county,  and  on  the  west  and  south  by  the  state  of  Wisconsin. 
Bessemer  is  the  county  seat.  It  has  a  population  of  2,500.  Ironwood  is  the  prin- 
cipal city.  Its  population  is  over  10,000.  The  other  principal  settlements  in  the 
county  are  at  Wakefield,  Watersmeet  and  Marenisco.  Previous  to  1885  there  was 
no  settlement  in  the  territory  comprising  the  county,  outside  the  few  miners 
who  were  then  engaged  in  exploring  for  iron  ore,  and  whose  efforts  were  crowned 
by  the  development  of  the  largest  iron  mine  in  the  world  and  a  number  of  the 
largest  in  the  country. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  rolling,  several  ranges  of  mineral  bearing  hills 
extending  through  it  from  east  to  west.  The  lowlands  are  easily  reclaimable,  and 
many  of  the  swamps  dry  up  as  the  timber  is  cut.  There  are  numerous  lakes  and 
rivers  in  the  county,  many  of  which  afford  splendid  opportunities  for  the  develop- 
ment of  water  power,  either  for  direct  use  or  generating  electrical  energy.  Although 
not  as  rich  in  pine  as  most  counties  in  the  upper  peninsula,  Gogebic  is  possessed 
of  vast  timber  resources.  Sugar  and  bird's-eye  maple,  birch,  bass,  ash,  spruce,  cedar, 
and  hemlock  exist  in  great  abundance.  The  soil  varies,  but  in  many  portions  of 
the  county  it  is  a  heavy  loam  with  a  clay  subsoil. 

The  county  is  penetrated  by  three  railroads;  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic; 
the  Milwaukee,  Lake  Shore  &amp;  Western,  and  the  Wisconsin  Central,  now  under 
lease  to  and  a  part  of  the  Northern  Pacific  system.  The  nearest  lake  port  is  Ash- 
land, Wis.,  located  about  forty  miles  from  Ironwood  and  forty-six  miles  from  Bessemer. 
The  railroad  companies  enjoy  a  very  lucrative  traffic  in  carrying  the  iron  ore  pro- 
duced in  the  county  to  Ashland  whence  it  is  carried  in  ships  to  the  furnaces  at 
Milwaukee  and  Chicago,  and  to  Cleveland  for  reshipment  to  Pittsburg  and  the 
other  iron  manufacturing  points  in  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio. 

The  principal  industries  of  the  county  are  raining  and  lumbering,  although 
manufacturing  is  receiving  great  encouragement  and  growing  to  be  an  industry  of 
considerable  importance.  The  greatest  iron  mine  in  the  world,  the  Norrie,  which 
has,  during  the  past  few  years,  received  great  attention  from  mining  and  iron  men 
is  located  at  Ironwood.  There  are  also  a  number  of  other  large  iron  mines  at 
Ironwood,  Bessemer  and  Wakefield,  and  excellent  indications  of  the  existence  of  ore 
at  points  in  the  vicinity  of  Watersmeet  and  Marenisco.  and  about  twelve  miles 
southeast  of  Lake  Gogebic.  There  has  been  some  exploring  for  silver  in  the  vicinity 
of  Wakefield  and  south  of  Bessemer.  There  is  a  large  outcropping  of  galena  near 
Marenisco,  indications  of  the  existence  of  tin  and  cobalt  near  Lake  Gogebic,  and 
numerous  veins  of  copper  bearing  rock  north  of  the  iron  range,  but  no  systematic 
effort  has  ever  been  made  to  ascertain  whether  those  minerals  exist  in  paying 
quantities.  There  are  also  indications  of  the  existence  of  an  iron  range  in  the 
southern  part  of  the  county.  The  Gogebic  range  extends  through  the  county 
from  the  Montreal  river  on  the  west  to  Lake  Gogebic,  a  distance  of  over  thirty 
miles.  Mining  is  conducted  with  considerable  profit  on  nearly  every  forty  acre 
tract  along  the  range  from  the  Montreal  river  to  several  miles  east  of  Wake- 
field, a  distance  of  about  fifteen  miles.  The  explorations  further  east  give 
promise  of  developing  into  good  mines.  The  county  consequently  offers  excellent 
inducements  to  those  who  wish  to  explore.  The  owners  of  the  land  will  extend 
mining  privilege  or  "  option "  to  any  company  offering  to  conduct  exploratory 
operations,  on  their  agreeing  to  pursue  the  same  in  good  faith  and  energetically, 
and  by  paying  a  royalty  on  all  ore  mined.  It  was  on  agreement  similar  to  this 
that  nearly  all  the  large  mines  in  the  county  were  explored  and  developed.  A 
party  of  men  desirous  of  speculating  in  a    mining  venture  in  a  small  way.  can 


Michigan  by  Counties.  233 

thus  find  plenty  of  opportunities  in  Gogebic  county.  Every  40-acre  tract  along 
the  range  may  not  turn  out  to  be  productive  of  ore  in  paying  quantities,  but 
where  a  few  men  organize  a  company  or  copartnership  for  the  purpose  they 
will  find  that  five  or  ten  thousand  dollars  will  go  a  long  way  toward  exploring 
a  property.  When  it  is  considered  that  previous  to  the  opening  of  tlie  great 
mines  here,  all  the  pi'ovisions  for  the  explorers  had  to  be  carried  into  the  county 
on  the  backs  of  men,  and  that  now  the  county  is  traversed  by  several  rail- 
roads, it  can  be  seen  how  economically  exploratory  operations  can  be  conducted 
now  in  comparison  to  a  few  years  ago.  Still,  the  chances  are  that  as  many 
great  mines  will  be  developed  in  the  future  as  in  the  past.  The  six  mines 
located  within  the  corporate  limits  of  the  city  of  Ironwood  were  assessed  last 
year  at  over  six  million  dollars  or  less  than  one-half  their  value.  The  develop- 
ment of  such  immense  wealth  in  a  few  years  is  onlj^  an  indication  of  the  untold 
wealth  that  still  remains  undisturbed  in  the  earth,  awaiting  the  expenditure  of 
capital   for   its  revelation   to   the   world. 

Lake  Gogebic  in  this  county  is  a  veritable  nature's  sanitarium.  This  lake  is 
twelve  miles  distant  and  900  feet  above  the  waters  of  Lake  Superior.  It  is  fifteen 
miles  long  and  one  and  one-half  to  three  miles  wide,  and  it  is  generally  conceded  to 
afford  the  best  black  bass  fishing  known  anywhei-e.  Brook  trout  are  found  in  trib- 
utary streams,  and  at  certain  seasons  of  the  year  very  large  brook  trout  are  caught  in 
the 'open  lake.  Gogebic  lake  is  a  favorite  resort  for  those  suffering  from  hay  fever 
or  throat  and  lung  troubles.  The  hotel  and  cottages  furnish  first  class  accommo- 
dations for  100  guests.  At  the  lake  is  a  fine  fleet  of  boats  and  a  steam  yacht.  The 
ti-out  fishing  near  Watersmeet  is  also  very  fine.  Both  places  are  reached  by  the 
Milwaukee,  Lake  Shore  &amp;  Western. 

Timber  lands  are  sold  at  from  85  to  812  per  acre.  Within  a  radius  of  one  mile 
of  the  center  of  Ironwood  land  is  valued  at  from  850  to  8100  per  acre.  Within  two 
or  three  miles  of  the  mines  it  is  held  at  about  825  per  acre. 

Ironwood  and  Bessemer,  although  young  towns,  are  places  of  considerable  activity. 
The  business  places  in  both  cities  are  substantial  brick  and  frame  structures.  Both 
cities  have  excellent  systems  of  water-works,  and  electric  light  plants.  The  county 
buildings  in  Bessemer  cost  850.000.  The  large  mines  in  the  vicinity  of  the  place 
furnish  employment  for  a  great  many  men. 

Among  the  more  important  objects  of  interest  in  Ironwood  besides  its  great  mines 
are  the  electric  street  railway,  several  saw  mills,  chair  factory,  and  an  arc  lamp 
manufactory.  Its  system  of  water-works  cost  nearly  8500,000,  and  it  has  an 
excellent  paid  fire  department. 

The  assessed  valuation  of  ciiy  property  is  about  87.000,000.  The  monthly  payroll 
of  mining  and  other  companies  is  over  8250,000.  It  has  seven  school  houses,  thir- 
teen churches,  fifteen  secret  and  benevolent  societies,  and  three  banks.  The  busi- 
ness houses  are  nearly  ail  of  brick  and  brown  sandstone.  The  hotels  are  commodious 
and  well  patronized.  Numerous  visitors  from  the  large  cities  patronize  them  during 
the  summer  months.  A  party  of  capitalists  have  given  a  bond  of  850,000  to  com- 
mence the  erection  of  a  large  furnace  before  July  1.  There  are  few  cities  in  Mich- 
igan that  can  boast  of  more  rapid  progress  or  greater  prosperity  than  Ironwood. 

The  accompanying  table  shows  the  amount  of  iron  ore  shipped  from  the  mines 
of  Gogebic  county  up  to  the  close  of  1892.  The  importance  of  the  mining  business 
can  easily  be  seen  from  the  fact  that  the  average  monthly  pay  roll  for  1892  at  the 
Norrie  mine  was  873,186.

GRAND  TRAVERSE  COUNTY. 


Grand  Traverse  county  was  organized  in  1851.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by 
Leelanaw  and  Traverse  bay,  on  the  east  by  Kalkaska,  on  the  south  by  Wexford, 
and  on  the  west  by  Benzie.  It  has  an  area  of  612  square  miles,  and  had  a  popu- 
lation in  1890  of  13,355.  Traverse  city,  situated  at  the  head  of  Grand  Traverse 
bay,  a  town  of  4,353  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  Northern  Asylum  for  the 
Insane  is  beautifully  located  near  the  city. 

At  least  two-thirds  of  the  county  is  quite  level,  while  the  remaining  third  is 
gently  rolling,  with  a  hilly  tendency  along  the  shores  of  the  bay  and  inland  lakes. 
Pine  plains  are  quite  extensive  along  the  Boardman  river,  and  cedar  swamps,  gen- 
erally reclaimable,  traversed  by  streams  of  running  water,  are  found  in  nearly  every 
township.  There  is  good  water  power  on  the  Boardman  river  which  is  utilized  at 
Traverse  City.  Half  a  dozen  or  more  smaller  streams  furnish  power  for  local  saw 
and  grist  mills. 

The  soil  is  principally  a  sandy  loam.  There  are,  however,  some  tracts  of  clay 
and  clay  loam.  The  soil  of  the  table  land  and  its  declivities  is  boulder  drift  of 
great  thickness,  in  some  places  being  fifty  feet  in  depth,  having  the  same  mineral 
characteristics  as  that  of  the  surface,  except  as  it  is  modified  by  the  influence  of 
vegetation  and  the  elements.  The  timber  is  mainly  sugar  maple,  beech,  basswood, 
elm,  hemlock,  pine,  and  cedar.  Wheat,  corn,  oats,  potatoes,  clover,  timothy,  and 
all  varieties  of  roots  do  well  in  this  county.  Corn  in  particular  does  much  better 
than  would  be  expected  in  so  high  a  latitude. 

Grand  Traverse  is  a  great  fruit  county.  Apples  and  grapes  are  raised  on  all  but 
the  swamp  lands,  but  the  more  tender  varieties  of  apples  need  the  protection  of 
the  bay  or  the  more  elevated  situations.  Pears,  peaches,  plums  and  cherries,  are 
very  successful  when  proper  attention  is  paid  to  the  selection  of  the  site.  Thousands 
of  bushels  of  huckleberries  grow  on  the  pine  plains,  while  all  other  varieties  of  berries 
are  perfectly  at  home,  either  in  the  field  or  garden.  The  famous  Parmalee  fruit  farm 
on  the  peninsula  is  widely  known  for  its  great  productiveness.  As  fine  peaches  and 
cherries  as  can  be  found  in  Michigan  are  grown  on  this  farm,  and,  in  fact,  all  over 
the  peninsula.  There  is  a  great  demand  for  the  fruit  of  this  county  in  the  Chicago 
market.  The  cost  of  clearing  will  average  $20  per  acre,  on  the  heaviest  timbered 
land  with  a  fair  market  on  the  bay  shore. 

There  are  3,120  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  Good  unimproved  lands, 
other  than  government  or  State,  are  held  at  from  85  to  $8  per  acre.  "Stump  lands'' 
have  not  been  in  great  demand,  and  can  be  bought  at  from  fifty  cents  to  $5  per 
acre,   while  improved  farms  bring  from   §15  to  $60  per  acre. 

A  State  road  runs  from  Traverse  City  to  Elk  Rapids,  thence  northward  to  Charle- 
voix and  Petoskey.  Another  runs  southeasterly  to  Houghton  lake.  The  roads 
may  be  said  to  be  in  a  fair  condition  for  so  new  a  county.  Snow  falls  in  November 
to  an  average  depth  of  two  and  one-half  feet.  The  ground  usually  freezes  but 
little,  often  not  at  all.  Plowing  usually  begins  in  April.  The  schools  are  quite 
numerous,  and  are  very  prosperous  considering  the  newness  of  the  county.  In 
some  districts  the  people  have  voted  a  tax  upon  themselves  for  school  purposes 
greater  than   all  other  taxes  combined.    Lumbering  is  the  principal   industry,  and 


Michigan  by  Counties.  235 

labor  is  in  good  demand  at  fair  prices.  Agriculture  and  fruit-raising  are  advanc- 
ing rapidly,  and  a  speedy  development  of  the  resources  of  the  county  is  near  at 
hand. 

There  are  a  number  of  pleasure  resorts  along  the  bays.  Traverse  City,  Elk 
Rapids,  and  Old  Mission  are  very  popular  during  the  summer  season.  The  Grand 
Rapids  and  Indiana  railroad  has  a  branch  from  Walton  to  Traverse  City.  The 
Chicago  and  West  Michigan  railroad  traverses  the  county  passing  through  Traverse 
City  thence  to  Charlevoix.  Grand  Traverse  has  great  shipping  facilities.  Steamers 
connect  Traverse  City  with  Chicago,  Milwaukee,  etc.,  and  a  shore  line  touches 
at   all   iioints  of   interest   between   Traverse   City   and   Mackinac. 

GRATIOT  COUNTY. 

Gratiot  was  organized  in  1855.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Isabella  and 
Midland,  on  the  east  by  Saginaw,  on  the  south  by  Clinton,  and  on  the  west  by 
Montcalm.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  has  a  population  of  28,668. 
Ithaca,  a  town  of  1,6*27  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  eastern  portion  of 
the   county   is  generally   level   while   the   western   portion   is  more   rolling. 

It  is  watered  by  the  Pine.  Maple  and  Bad  rivers,  and  a  few  smaller  streams, 
with  available  water  power  on  the  Pine  only.  The  soil  is  a  rich  sand  and 
gravelly  loam,  mixed  with  a  clay  loam,  generally  on  a  clay  subsoil.  The  pre- 
vailing  varieties  of   timber   are  oak,   ash,   maple,   basswood,   and   elm. 

Wheat  is  the  principal  crop  although  corn,  oats,  potatoes,  and  grass  find  a  soil 
admirably  adapted  to  their  growth.  The  apples,  pears,  and  plums  grown  in  this 
county  are  unusually  tine.  Peaches  are  not  always  a  sure  crop,  though  in  localities 
very  fine  peaches  have  been   raised   in  favorable  seasons. 

The  cost  of  clearing  averages  820  per  acre.  There  is  a  market  for  wood  in 
the  villages  along  the  railroad,  stove  wood  bringing  from  $1  to  §1.25  per  cord, 
and  four  foot  wood  from  SI  to  S1.75.  There  is  no  government  lands  remaining 
unsold.  There  are  640  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  There  are  unim- 
proved lands  in  the  market  which  can  be  had  at  from  88  to  815  per  acre, 
according  to  their  distance  from  the  railroads.  There  are  also  large  tracts  of 
••  stump  lands'"  which  are  held  at  from  83  to  810  per  acre.  Wheat  is  generally 
succsssful  on  these  lands.  Improved  farms  range  from  820  to  860  per  acre, 
according  to  location.  A  State  road  runs  from  St.  Johns  in  Clinton  county, 
through  Ithaca  to  St.  Louis.  Another  one  extends  from  Ovid,  through  the  east- 
ern part  of  the  county  to  St.  Charles,  and  still  another  runs  through  the  western 
part,  from  Hubbardston  to  Mt.  Pleasant.  The  highways  generally  are  in  a  fair 
condition. 

Snow  falls  in  December,  and  averages  two  feet  in  depth.  The  ground  generally 
freezes   to   a  considerable   depth.     Plowing  begins  by   April   1. 

The  public  schools  are  in  a  prosperous  condition.  The  country  schools  are 
quite  numerous,  and  the  graded  schools  of  the  villages  are  very  tine.  Lumber- 
ing in  hard  wood  is  engaged  in  somewhat  extensively.  Labor  is  in  good  demand 
on   farms,   in   clearing   lands,  and   in   saw   mills,   etc. 

The  mineral  springs  at  St.  Louis  have  a  world  wide  reputation  and  an  extensive 
patronage  at  all  seasons  of  the  year.  A  line  sanitarium  is  connected  with  the 
mineral   springs. 

The  D.  L.  &amp;  N.  &amp;  S.  R.  R.  traverses  the  county  from  east  to  west,  and  the 
T.,  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  R.  R.,   running  northwest   also  passes   through  th^e  county. 

HOUGHTON  COUNTY. 
BY    B.    T.    JUDKINS,    HOUGHTON,    MICH. 

Houghton  county  is  situated  in  almost  the  extreme  northern  portion  of  the 
upper  peninsula  of  the  State,  the  only  county  north  of  it  being  Keweenaw.  It 
is  bounded  on  the  west  and  northwest  by  Lake  Superior  and  on  the  east  by 
Keweenaw   bay.      It   had   a   population,  in   1890,  of  35,.389. 

Houghton,  the  county  seat,  is  situated  on  the  southerly  shore  of  Portage  lake, 
a  narrow  sheet  of  water  which  cuts  Keweenaw  Point,  as  it  is  called,  in  two, 
and  by  its  canals,  which  are  now  owned  by  the  general  government,  connects  on 
the  northwest  with  Lake  Superior  and  on  the  southeast  yith  Keweenaw  bay 
forming   direct   water  communication    west   with   the  head    of  Lake  Superior   and

east  also  with  Lake  Superior  and  the  remainder  of  the  great  chain  of  lakes.  It 
is  the  terminus  of  the  Houghton  branch  of  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic 
railroad  and  is  also  the  terminus  of  the  Mineral  Range  railroad  which  com- 
municates with  the  towns  north  of  it.  Here  is  situated  the  Michigan  Mining 
School,  an  institution  fostered  by  the  State  and  becoming  widely  known  as  a  seat 
of  learning  in  its  specialty,  that  of  mine  engineering  and  its  several  branches. 
Houghton  county  is  noted  as  a  particularly  healthy  locality;  the  air  is  dry  and 
clear  and  although  its  winters  are  cold  such  is  the  dryness  of  the  atmosphere 
that  it  is  felt  far  less  than  in  portions  of  the  country  farther  south.  In  summer 
though  the  days  are  sometimes  warm,  the  atmosphere  is  clear  and  the  nights 
are  always  cool  and  invigorating.  Its  several  principal  towns,  Houghton,  Hancock, 
Calumet,  Red  Jacket  and  Lake  Linden,  all  have  complete  water  systems  and 
good  drainage,  making  the  county  particularly  healthy.  The  business  of  the 
county  is  largely  given  up  to  that  of  mining  and  kindred  industries.  The  cop- 
per range  passes  through  it  from  a  southwesterly  to  a  northeasterly  direction, 
and  along  the  range  are  situated  within  its  territory  the  Atlantic,  Huron,  Quincy, 
Franklin,  Osceola,  Tamarack,  Calumet  and  Hecla,  Tamarack  Junior,  Centennial. 
Wolverine  and  Kearsarge  mines;  making  it  more  noted  as  a  coppor  producing 
district  than  any  other  spot  in  the  world.  Indeed,  the  Tamarack,  Quincy,  and 
Calumet  and  Hecla  mines   are   noted   the  world   over. 

Each  year  more  and  more  attention  is  given  to  agriculture.  The  soil  is  of 
the  best  and  all  of  the  hardier  crops,  such  as  oats,  wheat,  potatoes,  etc.,  do 
exceedingly  well.  Up  to  date  very  little  attention  has  been  given  to  wheat  owing 
to  the  limited  market,  but  as  the  yield  is  from  25  to  45  bushels  per  acre  more 
wheat  will  be  grown  each  year.  The  season  is  usually  long  enough  to  grow 
garden  truck  which  matures  very  rapidly.  Small  fruits,  particularly  strawberries, 
yield   very   abundantly. 

Although  hundreds  of  acres  of  timber  have  been  cut  off  there  are  still  thou- 
sands of  acres  of  as  fine  timber  standing  as  are  to  be  found  anywhere  in  the 
world.  It  largely  consists  of  pine,  maple.  Spruce,  Hemlock,  Birch,  etc.,  much  of 
it   being  easy   of   access. 

With  the  extension  of  our  manufacturing  enterprises  throughout  the  country 
Houghton  county  is  bound  to  attract  attention  from  those  looking  for  a  suitable 
locality  to  settle  as  its  advantages  are  numerous,  having  as  it  does  both  rail 
and  water  communicaction,  pure  water,  schools  that  are  not  to  be  excelled  any 
where  in  the  State,  and  a  climate  which  enables  a  man  to  do  a  largfer  day's 
work   than   a   locality  situated   farther  south. 

Houghton  county  is  one  of  the  wealthiest  in  the  State,  standing  as  it  does 
third   in  point  of   valuation. 

HILLSDALE    COUNTY. 

Hillsdale  county  was  organized  in  1835.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Jackson 
and  Calhoun,  on  the  east  by  Lenawee,  on  the  south  by  Ohio,  and  on  the  west 
by  Branch.  It  has  an  area  of  594  square  miles,  and  had  a  population,  in  1890,  of' 
30,660.  Hillsdale,  a  fine  town  of  3,915  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  general 
surface  of  the  county  is  undulating,  yet  in  no  place  is  it  so  hilly  as  to  interfere 
with  easy  cultivation.  It  is  well  watered,  being  the  source  of  the  following  rivers: 
Raisin,  St.  Joseph.  Little  St.  Joseph,  Kalamazoo,  Tiffin,  and  Grand,  and  will  average 
two  small  lakes  to  each  of  the  eighteen  townships.  There  are  many  small  water 
powers,  but  none  sufficient  for  heavy  manufacturing.  The  soil  of  the  north  half  is 
a  gravelly  loam  mixed  with  clay,  with  a  gravel  and  clay  subsoil.  That  of  the  south 
half  is  clay  and  clay  loam,  with  clay  subsoil.  The  timber  is  of  the  following 
varieties:  Oak,  hickory,  burr  oak,  black  walnut,  ash,  basswood,  maple,  beech,  white 
wood,  elm,  chei'ry,  and  tamarack.  The  principal  crops  are  wheat,  corn,  potatoes, 
and  grass.  All  crops  usually  found  in  this  latitude  are  successfully  grown.  Fruit 
growing  has  been  well  tested  by  a  long  experience.  Apples,  peaches,  pears,  and  the 
smaller  fruits  seldom  fail  of  fine  crops.  Shipping  is  confined  principally  to  apples, 
although  the  drying  industry  has  become  a  considerable  one  within  the  last  few 
years.  The  cost  of  clearing  will  average  §15  per  acre,  with  excellent  wood  markets 
on  every  hand.  No  government  or  State  lands  of  any  description  is  in  the  market. 
But  very  little  unimproved  land  can  be  had  at  any  price.  Improved  farms  range 
from  $30  to  SlOO  per  acre. 

The  roads  of  the  county  are  uniformly  good.  The  seasons  are  of  a  good  length. 
Snow  falls  from  November  20  to  December  15,  to  an  average  depth  of  a  foot.   When 


Michigan   by   Counties.  237 

no  snow  falls,  the  ground  freezes  to  the  depth  of  a  foot  and  a  half.  Plowing 
frequently  begins  by  March  20.  The  schools  all  rank  high.  There  are  at  least  ten 
graded  schools  in  the  county.  Hillsdale  college  at  Hillsdale  is  one  of  the  largest 
educational  institutions  in  the  State.  Agriculture  is  the  main  industry.  Cheese 
making  is  also  an  important  enterprise.  There  is  a  good  demand  for  labor  on  farms 
by  the  year,  and  particularly  from  early  spring  until  after  harvest.  The  Michigan 
Southern,  its  Lansing  branch,  the  Fort  Wayne  &amp;  Jackson,  and  the  Detroit,  Hills- 
dale &amp;  Southwestern  railroads  cross  the  county  in  different  directions.  Few  if  any 
counties  in  the  State  surpass  Hillsdale  in  privileges  of  markets,  railroads,  schools, 
churches,  and  all  of  the  surroundings  that  make  a  locality  a  desirable  residence. 

HURON  COUNTY. 

BY    FRANK    W.    HUBBAED. 

The  principal  industries  of  the  county  of  Huron  are  agriculture,  and  the  manu- 
facture of  lumber,  salt,  grindstones,  scythe  stones,  lime,  cement,  and  staves  and 
heading,  and  the  mining  of  coal  and  quarrying  stone.  The  agricultural  products 
ai'e  wheat,  rye,  oats,  barley,  hay  and  clover  seed,  potatoes,  carrots,  turnips  and 
mangels,  and  all  kinds  of  orchard  fruits  particularly  apples  and  plums,  which  thrive 
better  and  yield  more  abundantly  than  in  any  other  county  in  the  State.  This 
county  has  an  average  yield  of  eighteen  bushels  of  wheat  to  the  acre,  many  fields 
where  properly  drained  yielding  from  30  to  45  bushels.  There  were  shipped  from 
this  county  last  year  over  80,000  barrels  of  apples,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that 
most  of  the  orchards  are  young,  having  nearly  all  been  destroyed  by  the  fire 
of  1881.  Plums  are  a  certain  crop  and  frequently  yield  .300  bushels  per  acre  sell- 
ing  in  our  home  markets   at   about  §2.00  per  bvishel. 

,  The  county  is  bounded  by  water,  navigable  for  large  boats,  on  three  sides,  by 
Saginaw  bay  on  the  west  and  Lake  Huron  on  the  north  and  east,  which  results 
in  three  weeks  later  autumn  and  frosts  than  occur  a  hundred  miles  south  of  it. 
The  ice  in  the  lakes  results  in  a  later  spring  and  accounts  for  the  exceptionally 
fine  fruit,  as  it  delays  the  budding  until  after  danger  of  frosts  have  passed. 
The  land  is  not  hilly  but  has  a  gradual  slope  from  the  center  to  the  lakes 
being  about  175  feet  above  the  level  of  the  lakes  in  the  center,  affording  fine 
facilities   for   drainage   with   little   artificial   help. 

Originally  the  timber  was  diversified,  consisting  of  maple,  beech,  oak,  elm,  ash, 
hemlock,  pine,  and  cedar.  The  eastern  part  of  the  county  was  swept  over  by 
the  fire  of  1881,  leaving  but  little  green  timber,  but  there  is  still  considerable 
in  the  western  part.  The  pine  has  been  principally  cut  though  there  is  suffi- 
cient pine,  hemlock,  and  cedar  for  home  consumption.  There  are  probably  50,000 
acres  of  green  timber  in  the  county.  There  are  about  150,000  acres  of  improved 
land  in  the  county  worth  on  an  average  about  §.30  per  acre,  and  about  250.000 
acres  of  unimproved  land   worth   from  SIO  to  815   per   acre  according  to   location. 

This  county  is  not  excelled  in  America  as  a  grass  county.  Two  tons  per  acre 
is  an  average  yield  of  hay.  Timothy  and  clover  appear  to  seed  themselves  as 
they  grow  abundantly  wherever  the  fire  has  killed  the  timber.  The  soil  is 
usually  a  clay  loam.  The  burnt  timber  lands  can  be  cleared  for  from  $5  to  §10 
per  acre  and  when  cleared  leave  no  stumps.  Pine  stumps  in  this  clay  soil  burn 
out  and  leave  no  roots.  The  manufactures  of  the  county  are  at  pi-esent  limited 
to  salt,  lumber,  grindstones,  scythe  stones,  staves  and  heading,  lime  and  cement, 
though  there  is  a  fine  opportunity  for  many  other  industries.  Salt  is  manufact- 
ured at  Caseville.  Port  Hope,  and  Sand  Beech  to  the  extent  of  about  50,000 
barrels  per  annum.  Of  late  years  the  lumber  manufactured  is  limited  to  about 
ten  or  twelve  million  feet  per  year.  There  are  two  grindstone  quarries  a  Grind- 
stone City,  employing  about  three  hundred  men,  paying  good  wages.  At  Bayport 
the  stone  and  Inne  quarries  employ  about  one  hundred  men.  At  Sebewaing  are 
two  coal  mines  employing  about  one  hundred  and  fifty  men  and  producing  about 
600   tons  of   fine   bituminous  coal   daily. 

The  streams  of  the  county  are  from  25  to  30  miles  long,  rising  near  the  center 
and,  with  a  gradual  fall  of  ten  feet  to  the  mile,  empty  into  Saginaw  Bay  and 
Lake  Huron.  They  are  Cass  river.  Pinnebog  river.  Pigeon  river,  Willow  creek, 
Bird  creek  and  Sebewaing  river.  There  is  no  water  power  of  any  consequence. 
The  chief  villages  are  Bad  Axe,  the  county  seat,  Sebewaing  and  Sand  Beach 
with  about  1,200  population  each.  The  county  has  a  population  of  over  30,000. 
There   are   large    fisheries  at  Port  Austin    and  Sand    Beech,   but   no    large   vessel

interests.  The  markets  are  exceptionally  good.  With  deep  water  around  three 
sides  of  the  county,  connecting  with  all  eastern  lake  ports,  and  four  railroads 
intersecting  every  part  of  the  county,  freight  rates  are  very  reasonable.  Bad  Axe 
has   two   railroads  and   there    are   one    hundred  miles    of   railroad   in   the   county. 

There  are  over  fifty  churches  in  the  county,  so  located  as  to  afford  all  an 
opportunity  to  worship  according  to  their  creed,  the  churches  being  of  nearly 
all  denominations.  There  are  110  schools  in  the  county  and  but  few  are  so 
situated   but  what   the  schools   are   convenient  for  them. 

The  wages  for  farm  labor  run  from  one  dollar  to  a  dollar  and  a  half  per  day, 
or  from  eighteen  to  twenty-five  dollars  per  month,  and  boai"d.  Skilled  labor  com- 
mands from  $2.50  to  §5  per  day.  The  great  lakes  abound  with  all  kinds  of 
fish.  The  game  of  the  county  consists  of  deer,  bears,  partridges,  ducks  and  quail. 
The   birds  are  particularly   plentiful. 

SAND    BEACH    VILLAGE. 

BY    A.  H.  BROWNE. 

The  village  of  Sand  Beach,  the  most  important  town  in  Huron  county,  stands 
well  in  the  lead  of  being  classified  among  the  cities  of  Michigan  at  no  distant 
day.  Nature  has  endowed  it  with  all  that  is  necessary  to  make  it  deserving 
of  the  flattering  recognition  it  receives.  Sand  Beach  is  situated  120  miles  from 
Detroit  on  the  shore  of  Lake  Huron.  The  government  harbor  of  refuge,  costing 
§2,000,000,  lies  at  the  foot  of  the  town  and  is  a  haven  for  all  shipping  on  the 
great  lakes.  The  village  slopes  back  from  the  town  by  a  system  of  terraces, 
the  town  proper  being  located  on  an  elevation  that  affords  the  finest  natural 
drainage  in  the  world.  A  number  of  industries  have  already  sought  this  place 
and  are  dispensing  to  the  world  the  necessities  of  life.  Sand  Beach  is  the  ter- 
minus of  that  division  of  the  F.  &amp;  P.  M.  railroad  which  bears  its  name,  and 
the  water  and  railroad  privileges  provide  it  with  the  best  shipping  facilities  of 
any  town  in  Michigan.  A  fine  system  of  water  works  offers  excellent  fire  pro- 
tection, as  well  as  water  for  ordinary  use.  Its  inducements  to  manufacturing 
industries  are  unsurpassed,  a  810,000  bonus  now  awaiting  some  enterprising  man- 
ufacturer. Within  the  last  two  years  one  of  the  finest  mineral  waters  in  the 
country  has  been  discovered  at  this  place,  and  its  large  bath  house  is  daily 
visited  by  anxious  patients  who  hesitate  not  in  proclaiming  the  efficacy  of  the 
waters. 

The  resources  of  this  thriving  town  are  without  equal,  and  its  1,500  inhabitants 
are  enterprising  and  progressive.  The  climate  of  this  part  of  Michigan  is  per- 
fect, and  the  beauty  of  the  town,  coupled  with  this  advantage,  makes  it  a 
healthful   resort,  and  hundreds  of   tourists  find  their   way   here   in   summer. 

INGHAM  COUNTY. 

Ingham  county  was  organized  in  1838.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Clinton 
and  Shiawassee,  on  the  east  by  Livingston,  on  the  south  by  Jackson,  and  on  the 
west  by  Eaton.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890 
of  37,666.  Mason,  a  town  of  1,875  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  Lansing,  the  cap- 
ital of  the  State,  a  city  of  18,000  inhabitants,  is  located  in  the  northwestern  part 
of  the  county.  The  State  School  for  the  Blind,  the  Industrial  School  for  Boys,  and 
the  State  Agricultural   College,   are  also  located  in   and   about  Lansing. 

The  surface  of  the  country  is  gently  rolling,  just  enough  so  to  furnish  fair 
drainage.  It  is  watered  mainly  by  the  Cedar  river,  although  the  Grand  enters  the 
county  on  its  western  border  and  flows  through  Lansing  township  and  city.  There  are 
good  water  powers  at  Lansing  on  the  Grand  and  at  Okemos  on  the  Cedar  rivers. 
The  soil  on  the  original  oak  openings  is  somewhat  sandy,  while  oh  the  timbered 
lands  it  is  a  clay  or  black  loam,  with  clay  subsoil.  The  prevailing  varieties  of  timber 
are  beech,  maple,  ash,  oak,  elm,  basswood,  and  tamarack.  Wheat  is  the  staple  crop, 
although  the  soil  of  this  county  is  well  adapted  to  grass,  corn  and  oats.  In  fact 
all  grains  and  vegetables  do  well,  with  the  exception  of  barley.  All  fruits  usually 
raised  in  this  latitude  are  found  in  Ingham  county.  Large  quantities  of  apples  are 
annually  shipped  to  the  Chicago  market. 

The  cost  of  clearing  ranges  from  810  to  $20  per  acre,  with  good  wood  markets  in 
every  direction.    There  are  no  government  or  State  lands  in  the   market,  with  the

exception  of  80  acres  of  school  land  which  was  subject  to  entry  1890.  The  timbered 
or  wood  lands  are  held  by  the  owners  of  improved  farms  for  the  timber,  and  are  valvied 
at  from  $10  to  S25  per  acre.  There  are  two  State  roads  which  were  built  many 
years  ago,  and  which  are  kept  in  good  order.  The  ground  freezes  by  Nov.  15,  and 
remains  frozen  until  April  1.  Snow  falls  about  December  1.  but  the  sleighing  is 
by  no  means  continuous.  Spring  work  generally  commences  by  April  1.  The  schools 
are  all  good — those  of  the  villages  and  larger  towns  particularly  so.  At  Lansing 
there  is  a  fine  high  school  which  would  be  a  credit  to  any  city  in  the  land.  The 
principal  industries  are  agriculture  and  manufacturing.  Lansing  has  of  late  become 
quite  a  manufacturing  city.  There  are  extensive  agricultural  implement  and  engine 
works  at  this  place,  while  at  Williamston  and  Webberville  the  manufacture  of  barrel 
heading,  staves,  etc.,  is  extensively  engaged  in.  Common  labor  is  in  fair  demand, 
particularly  during  the  warm  seasons. 

The  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk  Railroad,  Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern,  Jackson,  Lan- 
sing &amp;  Saginaw,  Lansing  branch  of  the  Michigan  Southern,  and  the  Grand  Rapids 
branch  of  the  Michigan  Central,  all  traverse  the  county  in  different  directions, 
placing  every  township  in  the  county  within  easy  reach  of    the   best   markets. 

IONIA  COUNTY. 

BY   E.   J.    WRIGHT,   OF   IONIA. 

Ionia  county  was  organized  by  the  territorial  legislsture  in  1831,  is  bounded  north 
by  Montcalm,  east  by  Clinton,  south  by  Eaton  and  Barry  and  west  by  Kent.  It 
appreciates  its  friendly  neighbors,  but  is  as  independent  of  the  outside  world  as  any 
community  of  equal  size.  Its  lands  are  watered  by  many  streams,  and  its  undulating 
surface  is  richly  productive.  Its  rivers  fvirnish  valuable  water  power  at  several 
points.  The  native  fish  of  the  Grand,  Maple  and  Flat  rivers  and  their  tributaries, 
and  of  several  small  lakes,  have  been  reinforced  within  the  last  five  years  by  1,500,000 
wall-eyed  pike,  500,000  brook  trout,  20,000  eels  and  1,000  carp,  supplied  by  the 
State  Fish  Commissioner  and  planted  by  the  Ionia  County  Fishing  Club  and 
others,  and  furnish  rare  sport  and  valuable  food  products. 

No  finer  farms  than  those  of  Ionia  county  can  be  found  in  the  State.  Their  value 
is  attested  by  the  many  handsome  farm  residences  and  fine  farm  buildings.  The 
price  of  farming  lands  range  from  §30  to  S75  with  buildings,  and  825  to  §40  without, 
and  there  are  numerous  highly  cultivated  farms  that  would  bring  SlOO  per  acre 
if  they  were  open  to  purchase.  Wheat,  corn,  oats,  barley,  hay,  potatoes,  rutabagas, 
turnips,  beets,  and  other  cereals  and  roots  yield  abundant  crops.  The  value  of 
the  fruit  crop-is  large,  and  the  many  advantages  of  both  soil  and  climate  for  fruit 
production  are  receiving  constanaly  increasing  recognition.  Apples,  pears,  grapes, 
plums  and  other  fruits  grow  to  a  degree  of  perfection,  and  Ionia  strawberries  have  no 
superiors  and  few  equals.  Ionia  county  cattle,  horses,  sheep  and  swine  are  notable 
among  the  exhibits  at  State  and  district  fairs,  and  are  in  wide  demand  by  breeders. 
The  high  grade  wool  is  an  important  and  valuable  product.  Though  the  land  is 
principally  cleared,  there  is  considerable  timber  still  standing,  oak,  maple  and  beech 
predominating.  The  pioneers  of  the  county  are  largely  from  western  New  York. 
Sturdy  men  possessing  enterprise,  intelligence  and  knowledge  of  affairs,  and  women 
of  many  virtues.  They  early  took  a  prominent  part  in  the  affairs  of  the  territory, 
and  with  the  growth  and  advancement  of  the  State  to  which  they  contributed  largely, 
they  and  their  descendants  and  successors  have  received  merited  recognition.  Those 
who  are  wise  enough  or  sufficiently  fortunate  to  cast  their  lot  among  the  people 
of  Ionia  county  find  themselves  in  the  midst  of  churches  presided  over  by  learned 
and  eloquent  pastors,  schools  that  rank  as  the  best  in  the  State,  and  social  advantages 
rivaling  those  of  the  much  older  eastern  states.  Among  such  a  people  commerce  is 
well  sustained.  The  stores  of  the  county  metropolis — Ionia — as  well  as  of  its  sister 
city — Belding — and  the  numerous  thriving  villages  about  the  county,  are  as  well 
supplied  as  those  of  the  larger  cities.  The  thrift  of  the  pepple  is  made  evident  by 
the  strong  banks  to  be  found  at  Ionia,  Portland  and  Belding  as  well  as  in  smaller 
communities.  The  value  of  Ionia  farms  is  attested  by  the  recognized  fact  that  these 
banks  are  always  well  supplied  with  farmer's  money,  which  they  loan  with  safely 
conservative  liberality  in  aid  of  legitimate  enterprises. 

The  handsome  city  of  Ionia  (population  nearly  6,000),  is  the  county  seat.  Several 
important  and  well  established  manufacturing  establishments  are  located  in  this  city, 
notably  the  D.  L.  &amp;  N.  car  shops,  the  wagon  works,  furniture,  clothing  and  cigar 
factories,  pottery  and  pickling  works.     A  fine  creamery  gives  added  facilities  for  the

disposition  of  an  important  farm  product.  The  State  House  of  Correction  and  the 
Asylum  for  Dangerous  and  Criminal  Insane  are  located  just  outside  the  city  limits. 
Ionia  has  good  reason  to  be  proud  of  its  handsome  Court  House,  one  of  the  best  in 
the  State. 

The  infant  city  of  Belding  (population  3,000)  was  a  commons  less  than  a  half  a  score 
of  years  ago.  Silk  manufacturing  made  it  what  it  is,  and  today  it  not  only  has  two 
of  the  most  important  silk  factories  in  the  country,  but  prosperous  furniture,  casket, 
fire  extinguisher,  basket  and  paper  box  factories,  and  is  the  manufacturing  center  of 
the  county  and  the  wonder  of  the  State.  There  are  good  roads  about  the  county  and 
shipping  facilities  are  ample  and  rates  advantageous.  The  main  line,  the  western 
division  and  the  Stanton  branch  of  the  Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern  Railroad  and  the 
Detroit,  Grand  Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee  Railroad,  traverse  the  county,  all  but  the  first 
passing  through  the  city  of  Ionia. 

The  advantages  of  settlement  in  Ionia  county  are  numerous.  Taxation  is  not 
burdensome,  a  two  mill  tax  more  than  sufficing  for  all  county  purposes,  while  town- 
ship taxes  are  proportionately  light,  and  municipal  taxes  below  the  average.  The 
county  is  free  from  debt  and  the  superior  system  of  schools  has  been  established  and 
maintained  without  incurring  any  indebtedness  worth  consideration.  The  municipal 
indebtedness  reported  in  the  last  census  was  confined  to  three  townships,  $4,800; 
one  village,  $2,000;  and  the  city  of  Ionia.  $47,000,  of  which  $.30,000  is  the  bonded 
indebtedness  incurred  several  years  ago  for  a  system  of  water- works  worth  several 
times  the  amount  of  the  bonds. 

Ionia  is  a  county  of  beautiful  homes,  productive  farms,  excellent  shipping  facilities 
and  superior  educational  and  social  advantages,  and  has  within  its  borders  enough 
prosperous  communities  engaged  in  manufactures  and  commerce  to  give  to  the  farmer 
a  valuable  home  market,  and  to  both  capital  and  labor  remunerative  employment. 

IOSCO  COUNTY. 

Iosco  county  was  organized  in  1857.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Alcona, 
on  the  east  by  Lake  Huron,  on  the  south  by  Arenac  (the  new  county  formed 
from  the  north  part  of  Bay),  and  on  the  west  by  Ogemaw.  It  has  an  area  of 
590  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  15,224.  Tawas  City,  a  town 
of  1,544  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  gently 
rolling,  and  is  watered  by  the  Au  Sable,  the  Au  Ores,  the  Tawas,  and  numer- 
ous creeks,  inland  lakes  and  spring  brooks.  Most  of  these  streams  afford  a  fair 
water  power.  There  is  considerable  swamp  land  timbered  with  cedar  or  ash, 
nearly  all  of  which  is  reclaimable.  About  one-tenth  of  the  county  is  a  sandy 
plain.  On  the  uplands  the  soil  is  mostly  a  sandy  loam  with  clay  subsoil.  There 
is  very  little  stiff  clay.  On  the  lowlands  the  soil  is  entirely  muck  with  clay  or 
sand  subsoil.  On  the  plains  the  soil  is  very  light,  but  is  well  adapted  to  graz- 
ing purposes.  The  timber  is  pine,  hemlock,  beech,  maple,  black  and  white  ash, 
cedar,  and   some   tamarack. 

On  the  tillable  lands,  wheat,  oats,  rye,  peas,  beans,  potatoes,  etc,  are  grown  very 
successfully.  Rye  and  grass  do  well  on  the  sand  plains.  Potatoes  yield  from 
100  to  400,  and  onions  from  400  to  600  bushels  to  the  acre.  All  the  hardier 
varieties  of  apples  do  well,  and  plums  and  cherries  grow  to  great  perfection,  no 
trouble  being  experienced  from  insects.  The  home  markets  consume  all  the 
fruit   that   has   yet  been   produced   in   this   county. 

It  costs  about  $20  per  acre  to  clear  the  timbered  lands,  with  fair  wood  mar- 
kets at  the  villages  along  the  Tawas  and  Bay  County  railroad,  hard  wood  aver- 
aging $2.50  per  cord.  There  is  51,800  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry. 
Good  unimproved  lands,  with  all  of  the  timber  standing,  excepting  the  pine,  can 
be  had  at  from  $3  to  $10  per  acre.  There  are  also  thousands  of  acres  of 
"burnt  lands"  of  good  quality  of  soil,  on  which  all  the  timber  has  been 
destroyed,  which  are  held  at  from  $3  to  $5  per  acre.  The  "stump  lands"  from 
which  white  pine  has  been  cut  are  good  farming  lands,  and  the  prices  range 
as  above,  while  the  stump  lands  from  which  the  Norway  pine  alone  has  been  cut  are 
considered  as  second  rate,  and  of  no  value  for  farming  purposes.  The  Iosco 
and  Ogemaw  State  road  runs  through  the  center  of  the  county  from  east  to 
west,  and  connects  Tawas  City  with  West  Branch.  The  highways  generally  are 
new,  but  quite   numerous,  and    the   county  is   well   opened   up   by   them. 

Snow  falls  by  i\'ovember  15,  and  attains  an  average  depth  of  12  inches.  The 
ground  seldom  freezes  more  than  eight  inches,  unless  the  snow  fall  is  light. 
Plowing  begins   by   April   15.

The  public  schools,  particularly  those  along  the  shore,  are  in  a  good  condi- 
tion, great  care   being   taken   that   a  high  standard   shall   be   maintained. 

Lumbering  is  the  main  industry.  Ties,  telegraph  poles  and  posts  are  cut  in 
large  quantities.  The  manufacture  of  salt  and  plaster  is  also  extensively  engaged 
in.  Labor  is  in  good  demand,  and  the  demand  will  increase  as  the  county 
develops.  The  Tawas  and  Bay  County  Railroad  crosses  the  county,  connecting 
Tawas  with  the  Mackinac  division  of  the  Michigan  Central  Railroad.  The  Bay 
City  and  Alpena  Railroad  enters  the  southwest  corner  of  the  county  and  trav- 
erses the  entire  length  of  the  county,  passing  out  of  the  northeast  corner.  The 
county  has  forty  miles  of  coast  line  and  several  good  harbors.  During  the 
season  of  navigation  there  is  a  large  amount  of  shipping  to  and  from  these 
shore   towns,  steamers  from  Bay   city   and   Alpena   arriving   daily. 


IRON  COUNTY. 


BY   HON.   C.    T.    ROBERTS,   CRYSTAL   FALLS,    MICH. 

Iron  county  is  sitvxated  in  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan  and  is  nearly  the 
geographical  center  of  the  gi-eat  Michigan  iron  belt,  being  bounded  on  the  north 
by  Houghton  and  Baraga  counties,  on  the  east  by  Marquette  and  Dickinson 
counties,  on   the   south  by   the   state  of  Wisconsin,  and  on  the  west  by  Ontonagon 

and  Gogebic  counties.  It  was  organ- 
ized in  the  year  1885  from  territory 
taken  from  the  counties  of  Marquette 
and  Menominee.  Few  counties  in 
Michigan  have  been  endowed  with 
resources  equal  in  number  and  vol- 
ume to  those  of  Iron  county.  Locat- 
ed at  an  altitude  of  990  feet  above 
the  level  of  Lake  Michigan,  its  lofty, 
picturesque  hills  and  timber  clad 
plateaus  are  free  from  the  germs  of 
disease  and  obnoxious  gasses  that 
render  many  equally  beautiful  sec- 
tions of  Michigan  undesirable  habi- 
tations. Gushing  from  the  closets  of 
its  mineral  wealth,  sparkle  forth 
many  fountains  of  crystalline  water 
laden  with  mineral  properties  of 
medicinal  value. 

Iron  county  is  the  haven  of  the 
invalid,  a  veritable  sanitarium. 
Underlying  a  goodly  portion  of  this 
beautiful  territory  is  nature's  hidden 
wealth  of  ores  and  rocks,  not  a  lit- 
tle of  which  man's  diligence  has 
brought  to  light  and  into  the  world  of 
usefulness,  develofjing  their  sources 
in  a  way  that  would  afford  support 
to  the  people  of  the  county  were 
they  suddenly  deprived  of  the  other 
diversified  resources.  From  these 
inexhaustible  reservoirs  of  metallic 
wealth  were  taken  and  shipped  to 
the  markets  in  1892,  586,620  tons  of 
Iron  County  Court  House.  j^.^^  ^^.^       j,^   this  connection  it  must 

also  be  noted   that   the   mineral   lands  of    Iron    county    have    been    as    yet    only 
partially  explored. 

Ribbing  the  hills  whose  bosoms  yield  this  wealth  of  ore  are  vast  quantities 
of  valuable  stone  granite  of  various  hues  and  textures,  all  susceptible  of  the 
highest  polish.  Much  of  the  territory  of  this  county  is  yet  clad  in  nature's 
garment  of  hard  woods,  sugar,  bird's  eje  and  curly  maple;  yellow  birch,  and 
hemlock,  all  of  which  are  most  available,  both  in  point  of  price  and  transpor- 
tation facilities,  for  the  requirements  of  the  manufacturer.     A  considerable  amount

of  jjine  is  also  standing  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  county.  Through  these 
tracts  of  wooded  land  flows  many  streams,  the  Paint,  Michigamme,  Net,  Deer, 
Iron,  and  Hemlock  rivers  being  the  larger;  all  of  which  afford  ample  water 
power  facilities  besides  being  liquid  highways  over  which  the  product  of  the 
forest  may  be   transported. 

Nor  is  the  soil  of  Iron  county  productive  alone  of  mineral  and  timber  wealth. 
Its  fertile  plateaus,  when  stripped  of  their  natural  robes  of  hard  wood,  yield  rich 
crops  of  wheat,  oats,  potatoes,  hay  and  garden  vegetables,  all  of  which  find  a 
ready  market  at  good  prices.  No  class  of  people  are  more  thrifty  and  pros- 
perous than  Iron  county's  farmers.  The  present  transportation  facilities  of  this 
covinty  are  adequate  for  any  demand,  no  matter  how  rapidly  increasing,  for  many 
years  to  come.  Two  railroads,  the  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern  and  the  Milwaukee 
&amp;  Northern,  with  their  several  branches,  traverse  its  territory  in  all  parts,  with 
stations  at  accessable  points.  Its  highways  are  numerous  and  well  kept  and  a 
majority   of  its  bridges   are  of  iron. 

As  the  retreat  of  the  sportsman  Iron  county  has  few  peers,  its  woods  abound 
in  game,  deer,  bear  and  wood  fowl  of  various  species;  and  every  stream  teems 
with  speckled  trout,  while  in  some  of  its  lakes  whitetish  and  herring  thrive, 
besides  an  abundance  of  fish  of  more  common  kind.  The  banks  of  the  many 
beautifvxl  lakes  that  thickly  dot  its  rugged  bosom  are  tempting  camping  grounds 
for   the  resorter,  the   sportsman   and   the  health   seeker, 

The   population   of  the  county   in   1890   was   4,4.32. 

Crystal  Falls,  the  county  seat  of  Iron  county,  is  a  town  of  2,500  inhabitants. 
It  enjoys  a  most  picturesque  location  and  is  absolutely  free  from  the  menace  of 
,  disease  It  is  peopled  by  progressive  inhabitants,  is  a  little  city  of  metropolitan 
ideas,  and  has  all  modern  equipments,  such  as  electric  light,  water  plant,  etc. 
The  high  school  of  Crystal  Falls  has  no  superior  in  the  State,  and  its  many 
religious  societies  are  in  thrifty  circumstances.  Within  Crystal  Falls  are  repre- 
sented nearly  all  the  secret  orders  of  this  country,  among  which  are  several 
masonic  orders,  including  a  commandery  of   Knights   Templar. 

In  these  few  paragraphs  have  been  written  only  a  few  of  the  diversified 
resources,  advantages  and  inducements  which  Iron  county  is  extending  to  the 
manvifacturer,  the  farmer,  the  capitalist,  the  sportsman  and  the  health  seeker. 
This  volume  might  easily  be  devoted  to  the  work  which  this  page  has  attempted 
to  accomplish  without  danger  of  repetition  or  exaggeration.  All  that  present 
circumstances  afford  in  addition,  however,  is  the  cordial  commendation  to  all — 
come  and  see. 

ISABELLA    COUNTY. 

BY   HELEN   E.    C.    BALMEK. 

Isabella  county  was  organized  in  1859  and  is  geographically  the  center  of  the 
lower  peninsula  of  Michigan.  Bounded  on  the  north  by  Clare  county,  on  the 
east  by  Midland,  on  the  south  by  Gratiot  and  Montcalm  and  on  the  west  by 
Mecosta.  It  has  an  area  of  57G  square  miles  and  in  1890  a  population  of  18,784, 
being  an  increase  of  6,625  over  that  of  the  census  of  1880.  The  eastern  and 
northeastern  portions  of  the  county  are  comparatively  level.  The  remaining 
portions   are   rolling  (affording   excellent   drainage),   but  not   hilly. 

The  Chippewa,  Salt  river  and  many  smaller  streams  flow  through  the  county, 
and  afford,  together  with  the  facilities  for  transportation,  excellent  advantages 
for  fishing. 

The  soil  is  varied,  but  good,  some  parts  being  of  black  sandy  loam,  inter- 
spersed  with   yellow   eand.     The   subsoil    is  generally   of   clay. 

Of  the  different  kinds  of  timber,  in  large  quantities  may  be  found  maple, 
be^ch,  pine,  hemlock,  oak,  cedar,  white  and   blacK    ash,  rock   and   salt  elm. 

The  railroad  facilities  are  good.  The  F.  &amp;  P.  M.,  the  D.  L.  &amp;  N.  and  the  F.  &amp;  A. 
A.  make  good  connections  with  all  points  and  offer  the  best  of  accommodations 
for   transportation. 

The  water  is  of  excellent  quality  and  in  great  abundance,  there  being  no  less 
than   eleven  flowing   wells   within   a   distance   of  eight   miles. 

The  rapid  current  and  fall  of  the  Chippewa  afford  good  opportunities  for 
manufacturing,  and  its   waters  are   now  being   utilized  for   that   purpose.

Cost  of  land  depends,  as  in  all  counties,  upon  location.  Good  farms  can  be 
bought  for  from  8^0  to  850  per  acre,  with  easy  terms  of  payment.  There  are  about 
150,000  acres  of  good  wild  land  that  can  be  made  into  as  good  farms  as  any 
in  tlie  county.  These  lands  possess  a  first-class  soil,  and  can  be  bought  for 
prices   ranging   from  three   to   five   dollars   per  acre. 

Wheat,  corn,  oats,  hay  and  clover  seed  and  all  crops  that  can  be  grown  in 
this  latitude  are  to  be  found  here.  Fruits  are  also  grown  successfully.  In  fact 
Isabella  county   apples   are  obtaining   a  noted  reputation. 

Attractions  to  settlers  are  found  in  the  opportunities  for  power  for  manu- 
factories, unexcelled  school  advantages,  namely,  a  school  house  in  every  school 
district,  three  graded  schools  with  a  high  school  placed  upon  the  Normal  list, 
the  new  Michigan  Central  Normal  School,  with  Prof.  Bellows  at  its  head,  the 
government  Indian  Industrial  School  and  parochial  school.  Where  can  be  greater 
attractions  to  the  parents  of  those  who  are  to  be  the  men  and  women  of  the 
future? 

All  religious  denominations  are  well  represented,  and  churches  are  being  built 
throughout   the  county,  the  city   of   Mt.  Pleasant   alone   containing  seven. 

Saw  mills,  grist  mills  and  factories  furnish  employment  to  many.  Labor  is 
always   in   good   demand   and   well   paid. 

Isabella  county  contains  the  villages  of  Loomis,  Dushville,  Calkinsville,  Isabella 
City.  Blanchard  and  the  thriving  town  of  Shepherd,  situated  on  the  T.  &amp;  A.  A. 
Railroad,  and   the  city  of  Mt.   Pleasant   with   a   population   of  over  .3,000. 

Postoffices  are  established   throughout  the  county   at   convenient   distances. 

The  people  are  mostly  from  the  states  of  New  York,  Ohio  and  Indiana,  with 
nearly  every  state  in  the  union  represented.  They  are  hospitable,  kind  and 
intelligent,  welcoming  to  their  midst  all  who  seek  for  a  new  home  in  the 
beautiful   county  of   Isabella. 

ISLE  ROYAL  COUNTY. 

Isle  Royal  county  was  organized  in  1875.  The  county  comprises  Isle  Royal  and 
the  islands  adjacent.  It  is  located  in  the  northwestern  part  of  Lake  Superior.  It 
has  an  area  of  252  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1880  of  55  inhabitants. 
Minong,  a  lake  port  near  the  upper  extremity  of  Isle  Royal,  is  the  county  seat. 
The  surface  of  the  country  is  mountainous,  with  large-sized  swamps  at  intervals. 
The  land  is  so  rocky  that  the  soil  is  practically  valueless.  I'he  timber  is  mainly  a 
light,  scrubby,  bush  maple,  balsam,  spruce  and  cedar.  No  crops  or  fruits  have 
been  raised  on  these  islands.  There  is  21,868  acres  of  government  and  State  land 
subject  to  sale  or  entry.  The  winters  are  six  months  in  length,  and  snow  falls  to 
a  depth  of  five  feet. 

What  is  pronounced  by  government  engineers,  and  proved  not  only  by  scientific 
but  by  practical  test,  to  be  the  best  curbing  and  paving  stone  in  the  United  States, 
superior  to  the  Medina  sandstone  or  any  of  the  granites,  exists  in  unlimited 
quantity  on  Siscowit  point.  Isle  Royal.  This  stone  can  be  laid  down  on  the  docks 
of  any  of  the  lake  cities  at  a  cost  not  much  in  excess  of  half  the  amount  which 
is  being  paid  for  the  paving  material  now  being  used  in  Chicago  and  other  lake 
cities. 

There  are  also  good  fishing  grounds  in  among  the  islands.  Steamers  call  at 
the   lake   ports   quite   frequently  during   the  summer   season. 

The  history  of  Isle  Royal  is  somewhat  traditional.  It  has  been  organized  into 
a  county,  surveyed  and  laid  off  into  townships.  County  organizations  were  never 
very  prosperous  or  permanent.  In  fact  its  population  was  very  transient.  At 
some  timec  it  had  none,  then  again  fishermen  and  copper  hunters  would  locate 
temporarily.  The  island  does  not  seem  to  be  a  part  of  any  territory.  Its  geo- 
logical formation  would  indicate  its  origin  from  upheaval.  Indications  of  copper 
deposits  are  very  prominent  and  several  attempts  have  been  made  to  mine  it, 
all  of  which  were  failures  financially.  What  the  future  has  in  store  for  Isle 
Royal   no   one   knows. 

KALAMAZOO  COUNTY,  MICHIGAN. 

BY    FKANK    LITTLE. 

This  is  one  of  the  best  agricultural  counties  in  the  State.  It  is  located  mid- 
way between  Detroit   and   Chicago  on   the   line  of  the  M.   C.  R  R.,   HO    miles  by 


244  Michigan  and  its  Eesodrces. 

rail  west  from  Detroit,  and  139  miles  east  from  Chicago.  Kalamazoo  county  is 
bounded  north  by  Allegan  and  Barry,  east  by  Calhoun,  south  by  St.  Joseph  and 
west  by  Van  Buren.  It  comprises  16  townships,  each  six  miles  square,  total 
area  576  square  miles.  Altitude  above  sea  level  850  feet,  above  Lake  Michigan 
269  feet. 

It  was  surveyed  by  U.  S.  government  in  1829;  organized  in  1830,  and  offered 
for  sale  in  1831.  By  treaty  stipulations  the  Indians  vacated  the  county  in  1833. 
First  vi^hite  settlement  at  Prairie  Ronde  in  1828.  Present  population  estimated 
at  42,000.   eight-tenths  American. 

The  general  surface  of  the  county  is  undulating,  somewhat  broken  along  the 
margin  of  streams.  General  character  of  the  soil  alluvial  with  a  stiff  substratum 
of  loam,  gravel  and  clay  in  some  portions.  Mainly  dry.  About  seventy-five  per 
cent  prairie  and  oak  openings,  balance  heavy  timbered  bottoms  and  marsh. 
Native  timber  consists  of  all  the  varieties  of  oak,  maple,  beech,  elm,  hickory, 
black  walnut,  cherry  and  butternut.  But  a  small  portion  comparatively  of  the 
original  trees  remain.  Second  growth  forest  trees  are  now  maturing  rapidly  and 
will   soon  furnish  a  medium   supply  for   timber   and  fuel. 

Excellent  transportation  facilities  in  various  directions  are  furnished  by  the 
Michigan  Central,  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana,  Lake  Shore  &amp;  Michigan  Southern, 
Chicago,  Kalamazoo  &amp;  Saginaw,  Kalamazoo  and  South  Haven,  Michigan  &amp;  Ohio, 
and   the   Grand   Trunk  lines. 

Pure  water,  ample  supply  of  good  quality  throughout  the  county  secured  by 
wells  of  moderate  depth.  The  Kalamazoo  river  is  the  principal  stream  with  a 
large  number  of  tributaries,  all  well  stocked  with  speckled  trout.  Inland  lakes

varieties. 

Giill  Lake,  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  county,  is  a  magnificent  body  of 
water  nearly  seven  miles  long,  two  miles  wide  and  in  places  100  feet  deep. 
Twelve  miles  distant  from  the  city  of  Kalamazoo.  A  very  popular  summer  resort. 
Two  steamers,  sail   and  row   boats.    Excellent  fishing. 

Health  conditions  are  of  a  high  order.  No  climatic  diseases.  Cultivated  and 
uncultivated  lands  vary  in  prices  from  twenty  dollars  to  one  hundred  dollars  per 
acre  according  to  quality,  character  of  improvements  and  location.  No  U.  S., 
railroad  or  State  lands  for  sale  in  the  county.  Soil  productive,  wheat,  oats,  corn, 
barley,  beans,  potatoes,  hay,  rye,  apples,  pears,  grapes  and  small  fruits  are 
grown  successfully.  Much  attention  is  paid  to  raising  thoroughbred  and  high

Celery  culture  at  Kalamazoo  takes  high  rank  as  a  special  and  important  branch 
of  agricultural  industry,  having  grown  to  gigantic  proportions.  It  is  estimated 
that  the  celery  gardens  embrace  2,500  acres,  furnishing  employment  to  nearly 
3,000  laborers,  men,  women  and  children,  mostly  Hollanders.  Kalamazoo  celery 
has  attained  a  world  wide  reputation.  It  takes  precedence  in  all  the  leading 
markets,  being  shipped  in  large  quantities  daily  throughout  the  season.  The 
annual  product  of  celery  from  Kalamazoo  is  valued  at  1,000,000  dollars.  Kala- 
mazoo, a  beautiful,  thriving  inland  city  of  more  than  20.000  inhabitants  is  located 
near  the  geographical  center  of  the  county.  Its  broad,  shady  avenues,  paved  streets, 
parks,  lawns,  flower  gardens,  pure  water,  churches  colleges,  seminaries,  schools, 
public  library,  electric  lighting  and  railway,  and  neat  comfortable  residences  all 
evince  enterprise  and   elicit  universal  commendation. 

Kalamazoo  is  noted  for  its  varied  and  extensive  manufactures.  A  large  number 
of  operatives  of  both  sexes  are  employed.  Estimated  annual  output  7,500,000  dol- 
lars. As  an  evidence  of  business  activity  and  magnitude  far  excelling  other  cities 
in  proportion  to  their  population.  Kalamazoo  postoflBce  ranks  third  in  the 
State.  Its  annual  income  $52,000.  Value  of  building  $80,000.  The  United  States

This  imperfect  sketch  briefly  outlines  the  wonderful  growth  of  an  inland  county 
of  Michigan  from  a  wilderness  condition  in  1830,  but  a  little  more  than  sixty 
years  ago. 


Michigan  by  Counties.  245 

KALKASKA    COUNTY. 

BY    A.    A.    BLEAZBY. 

The  principal  industries  are  lumbering  and  farming.  The  lumbering  interest 
is  well  established  and  quite  general.  The  farming  interests  are  now  taking  a 
larger  development  in  our  county,  and  so  far  our  farmers  have  been  very  successful. 
The  products  of  the  farm  are  wheat,  rye,  oats,  tubers  generally,  and  for  the  last 
five  years  a  good  deal  of  dent  corn  has  been  raised.  All  grains  grown  in  south- 
ern Michigan  do  well  here.  The  face  of  the  country  is  gently  rolling,  and  the 
soils  are  sandy,  or  sand  and  gravel  loam  with  a  mixture  of  light  clay.  It  is 
what  is  known  as  warm,  quick  soil.  Those  who  have  given  their  attention  to 
fruits  have  succeeded  beyond  their  expectations.  They  have  raised  successfully 
pears,  cherries,  plums,  apples  and  all  sorts  of  small  berries.  Originally  the  land 
stood  one-third  pine  and  two-thirds  hardwood.  The  pine  timber  is  very  largely 
cut.  The  hardwood  timber,  except  where  a  few  farms  have  been  cleared, 
remains  an  almost  unbroken  forest.  The  principal  hard  woods  are  maple,  grey 
elm,  rock  elm,  basswood,  beech,  and  some  cherry  and  white  ash.  The  hardwood 
timber  lands  average  in  value  about  $10  per  acre.  To  clear  up  the  hardwood 
timber  lands  and  fit  the  same  for  the  plough,  after  the  saw-logs  have  been  taken 
off,  costs  about  815  per  acre.  The  manufacturing  so  far  has  been  along  the 
line  of  the  lumber  and  timber  products,  such  as  shingles,  lath  and  flooring.  We 
have  institutions  manufacturing  all  sorts  of  woodenware,  such  as  pails,  chopping 
trays,  butter  bowls  and  ladles,  and  almost  everything  that  is  made  in  those 
lines.  So  far,  the  manufacturing  interests  are  centered  in  Kalkaska,  the  county 
seat,  a  town  of  2,000  inhabitants,  and  in  South  Boardman,  a  town  on  the  G.  R. 
&amp;  I.  railroad,  of  about  500  population.  There  are  no  navigable  streams  in  the 
county,  except  as  the  Manistee  river  and  the  Boardman  river  are  used  for  the 
running  of  saw  logs.  There  is  but  little  water  power  in  the  Manistee  river,  and 
that  of  the  Boardman  river  is  utilized  at  Kalkaska  and  South  Boardman,  but 
neither  of  these  are  developed  to  more  than  a  small  percentage  of  their  capaci- 
ties. The  Rapid  river,  rising  in  the  northeast  portion  of  the  county  and  running 
in  a  southwest  direction  to  Torch  river,  is  one  continuous  chain  of  water  priv- 
ileges. There  are  only  two  or  three  water  powers  developed  in  its  entire 
length.  There  are  no  mineral  interests  in  the  county.  The  chief  towns  are 
Kalkaska,  South  Boardman,  Leetsville,  Westwood.  The  market  for  the  products 
of  the  farm,  so  far,  is  largely  a  home  market,  as  the  lumber  interests  consume 
a  gi-eat  amount  of  hay  and  grain,  thus  giving  to  the  farmer  the  benefit  of  the 
general  market  and  freight  added  on  all  he  has  to  sell.  The  only  exception  to 
this  is  the  potato  crop,  which  has  developed  very  largely  during  the  last  three 
or  four  years,  and  in  the  raising  of  which  the  farmer  has  taken  much  interest. 
There  is  no  crop  here  more  certain  or  more  profitable  than  the  potato  crop. 
Our  schools  are  well  developed  for  a  young  county,  especially  the  one  in 
Kalkaska  village,  which  has  seven  departments  presided  over  by  competent 
teachers,  and  is  the  equal  of  the  better  class  of  graded  schools  throughout  the 
State.  Our  church  interests  are  represented  by  organizations  of  Congregational, 
Baptist.  Methodist  and  Disciple,  all  of  which  seem  to  be  prospering  and  are 
well  supported.  Our  present  railroad  facilities  are  the  G.  R.  &amp;  I.  only.  Wages 
for  the  common  laborer  are  well  maintained  here,  as  the  cheapest  labor  earns 
$1.25  per  day.  Woodsmen  get  from  §1  to  S1.50  per  day  and  board.  The  mill 
and  yard  men  average  81.75  to  §2  per  day,  and  the  skilled  laborer  in  our  better 
class  of  mills  earns  from  83  to  85  per  day.  Farm  labor  generally  brings  from 
815  to  820  per  month  and  board.  All  our  streams  are  homes  of  the  trout  and 
grayling.  In  no  portion  of  the  State  are  waters  so  richly  stocked  with  these 
gamey  fish.  The  hunter  finds  here  what  interests  him,  the  partridge,  pheasant, 
woodcock,  deer,  fox,  and  occasionally  bears.  The  development  of  iron  in  this 
vicinity  has  made  a  market  for  all  the  rough  grades  of  wood  and  timber. 
After  the  sawing  timber  has  been  removed,  this  wood  cut  four  feet  long  and 
delivered  to  the  kilns  along  the  railroad  brings  81.35  per  cord,  and  this  pays 
the  farmer  for  what  he  desires  to  have  done,  namely,  the  clearing  up  of  his 
farm.  The  farmer  in  this  country  has  learned  that  his  land  will  produce,  better, 
and  seems  to  have  greater  staying  qualities,  when  as  much  of  the  forest  growth 
as  possible  can  be  removed  from  the  land  and  not  burned  upon  it,  as  was 
formerly  done.  The  lands  in  this  vicinity  which  are  covered  with  pine  are 
largely  if  not  entirely  a  light  sandy  soil,  and  so  far  have  not  been  put  to  any 
farming  purposes.  It  is  doubtful  if  at  present  there  is  any  known  way  of 
making  them  profitable   to  the  farmer. 


240  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

KENT  COUNTY. 

Kent  county,  in  the  west  central  xjortion  of  the  lower  peninsula,  consists  of  twenty- 
four  surveyed  townships  in  six  tiers,  and  ranges  west  from  9  to  12  inclusive,  each 
township  having  a  civil  organization  of  its  own. 

Beautiful  Grand  River  drains  a  fertile  valley  traversing  the  county  from  east  to 
west,  the  sides  of  which  rise  as  they  recede,  and  down  which  flow,  over  cascades, 
the  spring  waters  of  the  Thornapple,  the  Flat   and   the  Rogue  rivers. 

The  whole  county,  somewhal  level  irt  the  n-ortit  but  more  rolling  in  the  south,  is 
dotted  here  and  there  with  beautiful  lakes  abounding  in  fish,  affording  pleasure 
and  recreation  to  the  rural  population,  as  well  as  to  that  of  the  neighboring  cities 
and  villages. 

The  soil,  varying  from  a  limy  sand  and  gravel  to  the  heaviest  clay,  is  adapted 
to  raising  cereals  and  vegetables  with  great  profit,  while  the  choicest  varieties 
of  fruits  of  all    kinds  grow  to   a    perfection   attained    only  in   western   Michigan. 

Very  little  timber  lands,  excepting  that  set  aside  by  each  farmer  for  his  own 
use,  remain  and  while  there  are  yet  many  farms  in  the  first  stages  of  improve- 
ment, the  county  as  a  whole  is  well  developed,  and  prices  are  from  $25  to  $50 
per  acre  for  those  some  distance  from  the  county  seat,  and  from  $50  to  $200  for  those 
from  one  to  four  miles  from  its  city  limits,  according  to  location  and  quality  of 
soil. 

The  climate  is  comparatively  temperate,  rarely  exceeding  85  degrees,  with  an 
average  of  about  68  in  summer;  or  below  zero,  with  an  average  of  about  25 
above   in   winter. 

Grand  Rapids,  the  metropolis  of  western  Michigan,  the  second  city  in  the  State, 
containing  90,000  souls,  is  the  capitol  of  the  county.  It  is  surrounded  in  the 
county  by  such  villages  as  Sparta,  Byron  Center,  Grandville,  Rockford,  Ada, 
Caledonia  and  Lowell,  with  many  smaller  ones  more  isolated,  while  the  whole 
of  western  Midhigan  contributes  to   its  prosperity. 

The  county  is  traversed  by  railroads  centering  from  all  directions  to  the  city, 
which  ships  its  immense  product  to  the  world.  Its  furniture  has  no  bounds, 
its  land  plaster  and  gypsum  products  no    rivals. 

The  school  system  of  the  county  and  city  is  of  the  best,  and  the  best  is 
made  of   it. 

In  the  city  and  villages,  manufacturing,  and  in  the  country  agriculture,  horti 
culture   and  pomology   are   all   extensive. 

Grand  river,  preparations  for  which  are  made  to  deepen  from  Grand  Repids 
to  its  mouth,   a  distance  of  forty  miles,    so  as   to  be   navigable  for   lake   vessels. 

Grand  River  already  furnishes  an  immense  water  power,  which  the  improve- 
ment will  increase,  by  adding  largely  to  its  fall.  Flat  river,  pouring  into  the 
Grand  at  Lowell,  is  now  furnishing  power  to  an  electric  plant,  to  distribute 
electricity  for  manufacturing  and  other  purposes  to  the  city  of  Grand  Rapids, 
and  the  Thornapple,  a  few  miles  nearer  the   city,  offers  like  opportunities. 

Preliminary  surveys  and  preparations  have  been  made  to  deepen  Grand  river 
from  Grand  Rapids  to  its  mouth  so  as  to  make  it  navigable  for  lake  vessels. 
Virtually  making  the  city  a  seaport.  The  importance  of  this  work  could  hardly 
be  overestimated. 

It  is  claimed  that  Grand  Rapids  manufactures  more  furniture  than  any  other 
city  in  the  world,  which  taken  with  the  immense  amount  of  other  productions 
the   question  of   transportation   or  shipping  is  necessarily  of  vast   importance. 

KEWEENAW   COUNTY. 

Keweenaw  county  was  organized  in  1861.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north,  east 
and  west  by  Lake  Superior  and  on  the  south  b^'  Houghton.  It  has  an  area  of 
360  square  miles,  and  had  in  1890  a  population  of  2,894.  Eagle  River,  a  village 
of  100  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  county  is  traversed  by  two  ranges 
of  hills,  known  as  the  north  and  south  range.  On  the  slopes  of  these  hills  are 
heavy  growths  of  timber,  while  between  the  ranges  the  land  is  swampy.  It  is 
subj'^ct.  however,  to  drainage,  and  furnishes  excellent  pasturage.  The  county  is 
watered  by  a  number  of  small  streams  flowing  from  the  hills  to  the  lake,  and 
some  of  them  furnish  small  water  powers.  The  timber  is  principally  beech, 
maple,  pine,  spruce,  balsam,  tamarack,  ash,  cedar,  and  occasionally  black  oak.  The 
soil  is  sand  and  gravel,  and  when  first  cultivated  yields  fair  root  crops,  after 
which   it   will   produce  hay  for   a  few  seasons.     Garden  vegetables  do   well   in   the 


Michigan   by   Counties.  247 

valleys,  and  potatoes  yield  bountifully.  Strawberries  of  fine  size  and  flavor  are 
grown  to  a  considerable  extent.  Fruits  generally  are  not  sTiccessfully  cultivated. 
The  wood  cut  finds  ready  sale  among  the  miners  or  at  the  docks  along  the 
lake. 

There  are  76,380  acres  of  public  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry,  and  there  are 
some  unimproved  lands,  from  which  the  pine  alone  has  been  cut,  but  their  tim- 
ber as  yet  is  of  little  value,  owing  to  their  distance  from  the  markets.  There 
are  good  roads  throughout  the  settled  portions  of  the  county.  The  seasons  are 
well  defined,  there  being  fully  six  months  of  winter  and  six  months  of  warm 
weather,  with  a  very  even  temperature.  The  ground  does  not  freeze  in  winter 
owing  to  the  depth  of  snow.  The  schools  in  this  county  are  said  to  be  excel- 
lent. The  principal  industries  are  lumbering,  the  cutting  of  ties,  posts  and  tel- 
egraph poles,  fishing  and  mining.  Labor  is  always  in  good  demand,  high  wages 
being   pc.id   to   the  right  sort   of   men. 

There  are  no  railroads  as  yet  in  the  county,  but  the  largest  vessels  call  at 
several  of  the  lake  ports  during  the  summer  season,  affording  every  opportunity 
for   the  commercial   transactions  of  the  county. 

Keweenaw  county  is  in  the  copper  belt,  and  in  the  past  quite  an  amotmt  of 
copper  was  mined,  but  owing  to  cost  of  mining  and  low  price  of  copper  the 
work  was  abandoned.  It  is,  however,  not  dead,  but  quietly  resting,  and  great 
developments  may   yet  be  made  there  and  some  rich   findings. 

LAKE  COUNTY. 

Lake  county  was  organized  in  1871.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Manistee 
and  Wexford,  on  the  east  by  Osceola,  on  the  south  by  Newaygo,  and  on  the  west 
by  Mason.  It  has  an  area  of  about  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890 
of  6.505.     Baldwin  is  the  county  seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  level  or  gently  rolling  There  is  some  swamp  land 
which  is  nearly  all  reclaimable;  also  large  tracts  of  sandy  land,  most  of  which  is 
tillable.  The  county  is  well  watered  with  springs,  spring  streams  and  lakes.  The 
headwaters  of  the  Pere  Marquette,  Pine,  Sauble  and  Manistee  rivers  are  within  the 
borders  of  the  county.  Excellent  water  power  is  found  at  a  number  of  points. 
The  soil  on  the  sand  plains  is  of  red  and  yellow  sand,  with  no  subsoil.  The  pre- 
vailing soil  on  the  beech  and  maple  lands  is  generally  of  a  loamy,  gravelly  nature 
with  clay  subsoil.  The  timber  is  pine,  hemlock,  beech,  maple,  rock  elm,  ash,  cherry, 
oak,  white  cedar,  basswood,  birch,  tamarack  and  spruce.  Wheat,  potatoes,  corn, 
buckwheat,  ruta  bagas,  millet,  vines  of  all  descriptions,  beans,  peas,  rye,  timothy 
and  clover — in  fact  all  crops  peculiar  to  this  latitude — are  raised  in  Lake  county. 
Apples,  pears,  plums,  grapes,  and  the  smaller  fruits  do  well.  Many  young  orchards 
are  just  beginning  to  bear.  The  cost  of  clearing  averages  S20  per  acre  on  the 
heavily  timbered  lands,  while  on  the  plains  the  cost  will  average  from  85  to  $10. 
The  wood  produced  finds  a  ready  market  at  the  railroad  stations  and  at  the  char- 
coal kilns  at  Luther.  The  railroad  companies  buy  all  of  the  ties  and  posts  which 
are  offered.  There  is  4,891  acres  of  public  lands  for  sale  or  entry.  Unimproved 
lands  are  held  at  from  S3  to  $10  per  acre,  while  improved  farming  lands  range 
from  S3  to  825  per  acre,  according  to  location  and  improvements.  Hard  wood  is 
rapidly  rising  in  value,  as  there  is  a  great  foreign  demand.  There  are  large  tracts 
of  "stump  lands,"  also  of  "plains  land,"  ranging  in  price  from  50  cents  to  85  per 
acre,  which  eventually  will  make  good  agricultural  lands.  There  are  no  State 
roads,  but  the  county  roads  are  uniformly  good  for  a  new  county. 

Winter  sets  in  by  November  15.  Snow  falls  to  an  average  depth  of  two  and  one- 
half  feet,  the  ground  rarely   ever  freezing.     Plowing  begins  in  April. 

The  schools  are  comparatively  few,  but  good,  and  every  effort  is  being  made  to 
elevate  their  standard. 

There  are  a  considerable  number  of  lumber  and  shingle  mills  in  the  county. 
There  are  also  large  charcoal  and  chemical  works  at  Luther.  Ties,  posts  and  poles 
are  gotten  out  in  large  quantities.  Labor  is  always  in  good  demand,  particularly 
in  the  lumbering  districts,  wages  averaging  823  per  month  with  board.  The  Flint 
and  Pere  Marquette  railroad  traverses  the  county  from  east  to  west,  and  a  branch 
of  the  Grand  Rapids  and  Indiana  runs  from  Milton  Junction  to  Luther.  There 
are  several  logging  roads  in  the  county  of  from  four  to  ten  miles  in  length.  The 
lands  held  by  the  railroads  are  for  sale  on  time,  at  prices  within  the  reach  of 
every  one. 


248  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

LA.PEER  COUNTY. 

Lapeer  county  was  organized  in  18.35.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Tuscola  and 
Sanilac,  on  the  east  by  Sanilac  and  St.  Clair,  on  the  south  by  Macomb  and  Oak- 
land, and  on  the  west  by  Genesee  and  Tuscola.  It  has  an  area  of  666  squaie  miles, 
and  had,  in  1890,  a  population  of  29,213.  Lapeer,  a  city  of  2,75.3  inhabitants,  is  the 
county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  quite  rolling,  with  very  little  swamp 
land.  It  is  well  watered  by  rivers  and  spring  brooks.  There  is  little  available 
water  power  except  for  light  work.  The  soil  varies  in  the  different  townships  from 
a  sandy  loam  to  a  clay  loam.  The  subsoil  is  invariably  clay.  The  prevailing  vari- 
eties of  timber  are,  beech,  maple,  ash,  hickory,  elm  and  walnut. 

The  principal  crops  are  winter  wheat,  corn,  oats,  potatoes,  clover  and  timothy. 
Apples,  pears,  plums  and  grapes  succeed  well;  peaches  only  in  favorable  localities, 
and  in  favorable  seasons.  The  small  fruits  and  berries  grow  in  abundance,  and 
good  markets  are  found  at  the  railroad  stations  for  all  the  surplus  fruit.  There  are 
no  government  or  State  lands  of  any  value  in  the  market. 

There  is  considerable  unimproved  land,  with  the  pine  and  oak  cut  off,  which  can 
be  had  at  from  $5  to  §15  per  acre.  The  soil  is  of  good  quality,  well  adapted  to 
agriculture.  The  "  stump  lands  "  also  have  a  good  soil,  and  are  rapidly  being  taken 
up.     Improved  farms  range  in  price  from  820  to  S80  per  acre. 

There  are  three  State  roads  running  north  and  south;  one  from  Imlay  City  to  the 
forks  of  Cass  river,  one  from  Attica  to  Cass  river,  and  one  from  Lapeer  to  Lexington, 
via  North  Branch.    The  county  roads  are  generally  in  a  good  condition. 

Snow  falls  in  November  but  no  sleighing  is  looked  for  before  Christmas.  The 
average  depth  is  about  a  foot.  When  the  fall  of  snow  is  light  the  ground  freezes 
to  the  average  depth  of  two  feet.  Spring  plowing  begins  from  the  20th  of  March  to 
the  first  of  April. 

The  schools  and  school  buildings  of  Lapeer  county  are  all  good.  Agriculture  is 
the  principal  industry,  though  lumbering,  charcoal  burning,  and  the  getting  out  of 
ties,  posts,  and  telegraph  poles,  is  carried  on  to  a  considerable  extent. 

Labor  is  in  fair  demand,  particularly  on  farms  during  the  summer  season.  Farm 
labor  brings  from  S16  to  S20  per  month,  with  board. 

The  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk,  the  Detroit  &amp;  Bay  City,  its  branch  to  Five  Lakes, 
the  Almont  branch  of  the  Port  Huron  and  Northwestern,  and  the  Pontiac,  Case- 
ville  and  Port  Austin  railroads,  enter  the  county  at  different  pomts.  The  Otter 
lake  extension  of  the  Flint  and  Pere  Marquette,  and  the  Port  Huron  and  North- 
western also  touch  the  borders  of  the  county,  hence  the  farmer  can  find  good 
markets  in  any  direction,  for  anything  he  may  have  for  sale. 

The  numerous  railroad  facilities  found  within  the  borders  of  this  county  offer 
special  advantages  to  many  kinds  of  manufacturing  enterprises,  and  there  is  every 
prospect  that  Lapeer  will  have  its  full  quota  of  factories  at  no  distant  date. 

LEELANAU  COUNTY. 
BY   WILLIAM   HITCHCOCK,    LELAND. 

Leelanau  county  was  organized  in  1863.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  and  west 
by  Lake  Michigan,  on  the  east  by  Grand  Traverse  bay.  and  on  the  south  by 
Benzie  and  Grand  Traverse.  It  has  an  area .  of  360  square  miles,  and  had  a 
population  in   1890  of   7,914.     Leland,   a  growing  village,   is  the   county   seat. 

The  entire  county  is  a  peninsula  lying  between  Traverse  bay  and  Lake  Mich- 
igan. The  surface  of  the  country  is  quite  rolling.  There  are  two  ridges  lying 
in  the  same  direction  as  the  bay,  and  varying  in  altitude  from  a  water  level 
to  482  feet.  Between  these  ridges  are  a  few  cedar  swamps  which  are  reclaim- 
able  at  S250  per  acre.  Also  about  4,000  acres  of  cedar  swamp  at  head  of  Carp 
lake  which  after  the  timber  is  removed  will  make  fine  grass  lands.  There  are 
a  few   sandy   plains  of   no  considerable   extent. 

The  county  is  watered  by  Carp  lake.  Carp  river  and  several  smaller  streams 
and  lakes.  There  is  a  fine  water  power  at  the  mouth  of  Carp  river,  there  being 
a  fall  of  about  eight  and  one-half  feet.  Other  water  powers  are  found  on  the 
rapid  streams  in   the  interior   of  the   county. 

The  soil  is  a  dark  sandy  loam  of  remarkable  uniformity,  easily  worked,  with 
a  grstvelly  subsoil.  There  are,  however,  patches  of  clay  soil  in  every  township. 
The   timber   is    principally    beech,    maple,    elm,    ash,    hemlock,    birch,    cedar    and

basswood.  Wheat,  rye  and  oats  are  the  most  successful  of  the  grains.  The  quality 
of  potatoes  and  nearly  all  garden  vegetables  cannot  be  surpassed.  The  entire 
county  furnishes  what  are  known  as  "Traverse  bay"'  potatoes,  which  command 
an  extra  price  in  the  Chicago  market.  The  orchards  are  new^,  but  quite  exten- 
sive and  considerable  surplus  frviit  is  raised.  Peaches,  pears,  apples,  plums,  and 
cherries  do  well  wherever  proper  attention  is  paid  to  their  cidtivation.  The  cost 
of  clearing  will  average  from  SIO  to  $20  per  acre.  There  are  good  wood  markets 
at  all  points  where  the  steamers  land.  There  is  2.282  acres  of  land  subject  to 
sale  or  entry.  There  are  plenty  of  good,  unimproved  hardwood  lands  which  can 
be  had  at  from  $4  to  $10  per  acre.  They  are  all  within  a  few  miles  of  water 
shipping  points,  and  the  southern  portions  of  the  county  find  an  outlet  via  the 
Manistee  &amp;  Northeastern  railroad  which  now  passes  through  the  south  tier  of 
towns  and  a  branch  is  now  proposed  to  run  from  Lake  Ann  in  Benzie  county 
northwest  to  Glen  Arbor.  The  '•  stump  lands  "'  are  really  of  more  value  to  the 
settler  than  the  timbered  lands,  as  they  have  been  practically  cleared,  and  the 
soil  is  of  a  superior  character.  They  are  held  at  from  $5  to  §10  per  acre.  There 
are  two  State  roads,  viz:  the  Northport  and  Newaygo  road,  running  in  a  south- 
erly direction  through  Sutton's  Bay  and  New  Mission  to  Traverse  City,  and  the 
Northport.  Leland  and  Frankfort  road,  leading  southwestward  to  Manistee.  The 
county  is  also  well  opened  up  by  the  local  roads  which  are  generally  in  a  fair  condi- 
tion. Snow  falls  late  in  November  to  an  average  depth  of  one  foot.  The  grovmd 
does  not  freeze  to  any  depth,  and  spring  work  generally  begins  by  April  1.  The 
summer  months  are  tempered  by  the  lake  breezes,  and  the  climate  is  usually 
delightful  from    May   to   November. 

The  district  and  village  schools  are  generally  well  attended  and  well  kept. 
The  principal  industries  of  the  county  are  hardwood  lumbering,  charcoal  burn- 
ing,  the   cutting  of   ties,   posts,   poles,   hemlock   bark,   and   agriculture. 

Common  labor  is  always  in  good  demand  at  the  mills  and  furnaces,  wages  ranging 
from  $20  to  $25  per  month  with  board.  Several  large  bays  afford  some  of  the 
finest  harbors  on  the  lakes.  There  are  several  important  ports  along  the  coast, 
where  vessels  to  and  from  Chicago  land  for  fuel,  passengers  and  freight.  Carp  lake, 
an  inland  bodj'  of  water  18  miles  in  length,  is  a  great  resort  for  sportsmen  during 
the  summer  and  fall  seasons.  The  county  is  destined  to  become  a  great  fruit  dis- 
trict. In  the  spring  of  189.3.  it  is  estimated,  as  many  fruit  trees  were  planted  as 
were  already  growing  and  fully  $200,000  worth  of  fruit  was  shipped  from  this  county 
the  previous  year. 

LENAWEE  COUNTY. 

BY    NORMAN    GEDDES,    ADRIAN,    MICH. 

Lenawee  county  was  organized  in  182G.  Is  bounded  north  by  Jackson  and 
Washtenaw,  east  by  Monroe,  south  by  the  State  of  Ohio,  and  on  the  west  by 
Hillsdale.  The  northwestern  portion  is  somewhat  hilly,  the  central  undulating 
and  the  eastern  and  southern  portions  level.  It  has  almost  every  variety  of 
soil,  producing  bountiful  crops  of  wheat,  corn,  oats,  barley,  rye.  potatoes,  and  in 
some  localities  most  excellent  celery.  Nearly  all  the  fruits,  apples,  pears,  peaches 
and  the  small  fruits  peculiar  to  this  latitude,  are  successfully  raised.  In  dairy 
products,  it  takes  high  rank,  having  in  successful  operation  from  twenty  to 
thirty  cheese  factories  and  creameries.  Agriculturally,  it  is  one  of  the  richest 
counties  in  the  country,  and  in  the  United  States  census  of  1880  was  given 
the  first  place  among  all  the  counties  in  the  various  states  in  the  matter  of 
agricultural  products.  It  has  very  little  swamp  or  waste  land.  About  one-third 
of  the  county  was  what  in  its  early  settlement  was  called  oak  openings,  and 
the  residue  heavily  timbered  with  oak,  black  walnut,  whitewood,  maple,  beech, 
basswood,  hickory,  ash.  elm,  sycamore,  etc.  It  is  well  watered  by  running  streams, 
the  principal  being  the  River  Raisin  and  its  branches,  the  Raisin  rising  in  one 
of  the  small  lakes  of  the  county  and  emptying  into  Lake  Erie  at  Monroe.  In 
the  northeastern  part  of  the  county  are  numerous  small  lakes,  some  covering 
only  a  few  acres,  while  others  are  several  miles  in  circumference,  and  so  beau- 
tiful are  they,  and  so  healthful  their  locality,  that  some  of  them  have  become 
favorite  summer  resorts,  with  hotels  and  cottages,  one  having  already  some  forty 
cottages  upon  its  banks,  mainly  owned  by  residents  of  Adrian,  Detroit.  Toledo, 
Tecumseh   and    the   farmers   of    the   county.      The   price   of   farming    lands  varies

■from  S30  to  8100  per  acre,  depending  on  proximity  to  or  distance  from  the 
•cities  and  villages  and  the  character  of  the  buildings  and  improvements.  The 
county  is  traversed  by  three  great  lines  of  railroad,  from  east  to  west  by  the 
Ij.  S.  &amp;  M.  S.  and  the  C.  J.  &amp;  M.,  and  from  northeast  to  southwest  by  the 
Wabash  Railway,  in  addition  to  which  are  the  L.  S.  &amp;  M.  S.  from  Adrian  to 
Monroe  and  Detroit,  the  branch  from  Adrian  to  Jackson,  the  Dundee  branch 
from  Adrian  to  Trenton  and  Detroit  and  the  Fayette  branch  from  Adrian  to 
Fayette,  Ohio. 

The  well  improved  farms  and  farm  houses  to  be  seen  on  every  hand  plainly 
Indicate  that  the  farmers  of  this  county  are  an  exceptionally  prosperous  people. 
The  excellence  of  the  soil  and  its  adaptability  to  mixed  farming  and  fruit  rais- 
ing, the  healthfulness  of  the  climate,  its  railroad  facilities  (no  farm  in  the  county 
being  over  six  miles  from  a  railroad  station),  the  character,  intelligence  and  high 
moral  tone  of  its  people,  make  this  one  of  the  most  desirable  counties  for  agri- 
culture  or   manufacture  to   be  found   in   this  or   any  other   State. 

Its  largest  town,  Adrian,  the  county  seat,  one  of  the  most  beautiful  of  the 
many  beautiful  inland  cities  of  the  State,  offers  peculiar  advantages  for  manu- 
facturing enterprises,  competing  railroads,  facilities  for  shipping  in  all  directions, 
and  as  a  place  of  residence  superior,  in  point  of  health,  beauty  and  comfort,  to 
any  city  of  its  size  in  the  country.  Its  educational  advantages  are  unsurpassed, 
its  high  school  ranking  among  the  best  in  the  country,  while  Adrian  College, 
one  of  the  best  in  the  State,  supplements  the  high  school  by  affording  oppor- 
tunities for  obtaining  a  thorough  collegiate  education  at  very  moderate  cost. 
The  State  Industrial  Home  for  Girls  is  located  here.  Among  its  manufacturing 
establishments  (some  of  them  in  their  infancy),  already  employing  in  the  aggre- 
gate nearly  2,000  men,  may  be  mentioned  the  L.  S.  &amp;  M.  S.  car  shops,  the  Gilli- 
land  Electric  Co.,  Adrian  Furniture  Manufacturing  Co.,  Straw  and  Felt  Goods  Man- 
ufacturing Co.,  three  large  canning  factories,  Page  Woven  Wire  Fence  Co.,  Adrian 
Brick  and  Tile  Machine  Co.,  Kells  &amp;  Sons'  Brick  Machine  Works,  three 
lumber  yards  and  planing  mills,  the  Washington  Milling  Co.,  the  Hand  Milling 
Co.,  electric  light  and  gas  works,  the  Church  Manufacturing  Co.,  Palmers  Manu- 
facturing Co.,  and   large   numbers  of  smaller   establishments. 

The  city  of  Hudson  and  the  villages  of  Tecumseh,  Blissfield,  Clinton,  Clayton, 
Morenci,  Weston,  Fairfield,  Addison,  Deerfield,  Onsted,  Ridgeway,  Riga,  Jaspar, 
Palmyra,  Addison,  Mason  and  Britton,  are  all  delightful,  and  most  of  them  pros- 
perous towns,  affording  convenient  and  excellent  markets,  shipping  facilities, 
good   schools,  society   and  churches. 

LIVINGSTON  COUNTY. 

Livingston  county  was  organized  in  1836.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles 
and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  20,858.  Howell,  the  county  seat,  had  at  the 
same   time   2,387   inhabitants. 

It  is  strictly  an  agricultural  county.  Her  products  embrace  all  the  grains, 
grasses  and  vegetables  of  the  temperate  zone.  Her  soil  is  mainly  sand,  gravel 
or  clay  loam,  well  adapted  to  the  growth  of  wheat,  corn,  oats,  rye  and  grass, 
being  high,  rolling  and  well  drained.  Nearly  all  fruits  are  grown  successfully, 
as  the  county  is  exceptionally  free  from  early  or  late  frosts.  The  timber  is 
mainly  hard  wood,  all  the  varieties  of  oak,  beech,  maple,  hickory,  elm  and  ash. 
"Very  little  timber  is  left  in  the  county  except  what  is  kept  for  home  use.  The 
lands  are  well  improved  and  average  value  of  farm  land  is  S30  to  850  per  acre. 
Unimproved  being  mostly  woodland  is  as  valuable  as  improved.  We  have  little 
manufacturing,  except  flour  for  home  use.  Livingston  has  no  large  rivers,  the 
Huron  being  the  largest,  which  is  not  navigable,  but  furnishes  water  power  along 
its  whole  length.  No  mines  or  minerals  or  quarries  are  as  yet  discovered.  Our 
chief  towns  are  Howell,  population  3,000;  Brighton,  1,200;  Fowlerville,  1,500,  whose 
chief  industry  is  retail  trade  and  mechanics  of  various  trades.  No  vessel  inter- 
ests, though  she  has  a  multitude  of  small  inland  lakes,  which  afford  good  sport 
for   local   fishing. 

The  county  is  crossed  by  three  lines  of  railway,  the  D.,  L.  &amp;  N.,  T.  &amp;  A.  A. 
and  Grand  Trunk,  which  give  the  farmers  good  markets  with  short  hauls.  The 
county  is  dotted  with  schools  and  churches.  Farm  wages  range  from  816  to 
$20  per  month  with  board,  and  825  to  830  without  board.  Skilled  labor  from 
-$2  to  83  per  day.  Our  lakes  are  stocked  with  all  kinds  of  native  fish,  and  our 
■woodland   with   small  game.

LUCE   COUNTY 

■Organized  by  legislature  in  1887.  The  territory  comprising  the  county  was 
taken  largely  from  Chippewa  county,  with  five  townships  from  Mackinac.  It 
has  an  area  of  581,437  acres,  and  a  population  in  1890  of  2,455.  The  county  is 
bounded  on  the  north  by  Lake  Superior,  east  by  Chippewa  county,  south  by  Mack- 
inac county,  and  west  by  Schoolcraft  and  Alger  counties. 

The  farming  lands  are  rich  and  productive  and  this  county  offers  many  induce- 
ments to  the  immigrant  to  settle  here  and  procure  free  a  home  of  eighty  or 
one  hundred  and  sixty  acres  of  fine  timbered  and  agricultural  lands.  The  Tahquam- 
enon  river,  with  its  several  branches,  wind  through  this  county  for  over  one  hundred 
miles,  not  only  furnishing  excellent  water  privileges  but  drainage  as  well.  The 
valleys  along  this  river  abound  in  great  quantities  of  yellew  birch  and  bird's-eye 
maple.  These  valuable  woods  are  used  largely  for  veneering  purposes  in  the  man- 
ufacture of  furniture.  Large  tracts  of  pine  still  remain  standing  m  the  northern 
part  of  the  county.  This  timber  is  the  most  valuable  of  any  now  remaining  in 
the  State.  There  remains  39,041  acres  of  public  lands  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  In 
•addition  to  the  public  lands,  there  are  many  thousands  of  acres  of  railroad  lands 
for  sale  cheap  and  on  long  time.  The  county  is  organized  into  four  townships, 
and  already  has  hundreds  of  prosperous  farmers,  with  good  buildings  and  well 
worked  farms.  The  roads  are  excellent  for  a  new  country,  have  been  made  so  by 
the  many  large  lumbering  firms  operating  here.  The  schools  are  the  very  best; 
•each  township  is  organized  on  the  unit  system  with  but  one  board  to  establish  and 
control  district  schools  at  convenient  intervals. 

Newberry,  the  county  seat,  is  a  thriving  village  beautifully  laid  out  with  broad 
avenues  and  streets,  has  a  fine  system  of  water  works,  electric  lights  and  other 
modern  improvements  to  be  found  in  a  live  and  hustling  town.  Located  here 
is  a  large  iron  smelti  ng  furnace  employing  several  hundred  hands  the  year  round. 
In  connection  with  the  furnace  are  a  large  number  of  charcoal  burners,  which 
makes  a  ready  market  for  wood  from  the  farmers.  Large  chemical  works  are 
operated  here,  the  chief  product  of  which  is  wood  alcohol.  These  works  also 
employ   many   men. 

Adjoining  the  village  is  the  great  celery  farm  operated  by  the  Newberry  Celery 
Co.,  which  also  employs  many  hands.  This  celery  has  gained  a  widespread  reputa- 
tion for  its  rich,  tender  and  brittle  branches  Large  shipments  are  daily  made 
as  far  west  as  Montana,  south  to  Illinois,  and  east  to  Montreal,  Toronto  and 
Quebec.  St.  Paul,  Minneapolis  and  Duluth  are  all  prominent  markets  for  New- 
berry celery.  The  soil  in  this  vicinity  is  especially  adapted  for  growing  this 
excellent  culinary  plant.  H.  L.  Harris,  the  secretary  of  the  company,  recently 
forwarded  a  quantity  of  this  celery  growing  soil  to  the  State  Agricultural  College, 
and  Bulletin  No.  99,  of    this  institution,  gives  the  following  analysis:

MACKINAC   COUNTY. 

BY    P.    D.    BISSELL,   ST.    IGNACE. 

Mackinac  county  was  organized  in  1818.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Chip- 
pewa and  Luce,  on  the  east  by  Chippewa  and  Lake  Huron,  on  the  south  by 
Lakes  Huron  and  Michigan,  and  on  the  west  by  Schoolcraft.  It  has  an  area 
of  958  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  7,830.  St.  Ignace,  a  city 
of  .3,000  inhabitants,  located  on  the  Straits  of  Mackinac  at  the  southern  extrem- 
ity of  the  county,  is  the  county  seat.  It  is  at  present  the  great  distributing 
point  for  the  eastern  portion  of  the  upper  peninsula.  One  of  the  largest  blast 
furnaces  in  the  State,  with  a  capacity  of  60  tons  of  charcoal  pig  iron  daily,  and 
employing  100   men,  is  located  here. 

Another  of  the  city's  industries  is  the  large  lumbering  concern  of  the  J.  A. 
Jamieson  Lumber  Company,  a  corporation  with  $75,000  capital  stock,  manufact- 
urers of  lumber,  car  sills,  etc.  St.  Ignace  has  two  finely  appointed  and  commo- 
dious hotels  of  the  first  class,  which  are  thronged  with  tourists  each  summer, 
and  a  number  of  hotels  of  less  size  and  pretensions.  The  city  schools  are 
graded  according  to  the  Michigan  system,  occupy  two  roomy  ward  buildings,  and 
the  high  school,  the  latter  a  very  handsome  brick  structure.  There  are  Catho 
lie.  Congregational,  Methodist,  Presbyterian,  Episcopal,  Baptist  and  Lutherani 
societies,  the  latter  only  lacking  a  church  home.  The  city  has  a  grand  harbor, 
with  25  feet  of  water  right  up  to  her  piers,  and  is  already  a  large  shipping 
point  and  destined  to  rapidly  increase  in  commercial  importance.  The  system 
of  docks,  large  as  it  is,  will  soon  be  too  small  for  the  increasing  traffic  center- 
ing at  this  point.  The  First  National  bank  of  this  city,  a  prosperous  banking 
house,  reports  for  the  past  year  an  average  of  $100,000  of  savings  deposits,  an 
increase  of  $25,000  over  the  year  previous.  This  total  is  made  up  of  small 
deposits  and  represents  the  savings  of  the  wage  earners.  The  commercial 
deposits  aggregate   as  much   more. 

The  city  has  the  usual  number  of  stores  and  business  houses,  many  of  them 
carrying  very  heavy  stocks  and  jobbing  to  dealers  in  adjacent  towns.  Each 
year  increases  the  tide  of  summer  travel  to  St.  Ignace,  and  to  accommodate  the 
tourists  a  project  for  the  erection  of  a  big  summer  hotel  is  well  under  way, 
and   much  of   the   capital   stock   is  already   subscribed. 

Mackinac  island,  situated  in  the  Straits  of  Mackmac,  six  miles  from  St.  Ignace. 
near  the  junction  of  Lakes  Huron  and  Michigan,  and  now  a  national  park,  is 
widely  known  as  one  of  the  most  delightful  summer  resorts  in  the  northwest. 
The  historical  associations  attached  to  this  beautiful  island  and  its  surround- 
ings are  of  great  interest.  This  magnificent  resort  has  abundant  hotel  accom- 
modations. No  other  port  in  Michigan  has  as  many  passenger  steamers  call- 
ing at  its  docks  as  has  Mackinac  in  the  tourist  season,  and  very  many  of  these 
steamers  are  great  floating  palaces.  It  is  estimated  that  from  iO.OOO  to  50,000 
tourists  visit  Mackinac  each  season.  Very  many  wealthy  families  of  Chicago, 
Detroit  and  other  cities  have  leased  holdings  of  the  government  and  have  erected 
summer  homes  thereon.  The  chief  points  of  interest  are  Arch  Rock,  Sugar 
Loaf  Rock,  Lover's  Leap,  Robinson's  Folly.  British  Landing,  Old  Fort  Holmes  and 
Battle  Field,  the  venerable  Fort  Mackinac,  still  occupied  by  U.  S.  troops,  Pontiac's 
Lookout,  etc.     Mackinac   island  is  the   Newport  of    the  great  northwest. 

The  eastern  portion  of  the  county  is  an  elevated  plateau.  Up  the  valleys  of 
the  Pine  and  Carp  rivers  there  is  considerable  cedar  swamp,  all  of  which  is 
considerably  elevated  above  the  level  of  the  lake.  Along  the  line  of  the  Duluth, 
South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic  Railroad  the  land  is  generally  level,  with  occasional 
cedar  swamps,  which  are  so  high  as  to  admit  of  excellent  drainage.  The  large 
swamps  of  the  Tahquamenon  lie  almost  entirely  north  of  this  county,  their 
southern  border  being  nearly  250  feet  above  the  lake  level.  The  western  por- 
tion of  the  county  is  more  rolling,  some  of  its  hills  rising  200  or  300  feet  above 
Lake  Michigan.  There  is,  however,  but  little  waste  land,  even  the  hilly  portions 
being  easily  cultivated.  Along  the  border  of  Lake  Michigan  there  is  a  narrow 
strip  of  quite  sandy  land.  The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Pine,  Carp,  Black, 
Mille  Coquin  and  Milakoka  rivers,  and  by  the  branches  of  the  Tahquamenon 
and  Manistique.  There  are  also  many  fine  inland  lakes,  the  most  notable  of 
which  is  the  Manistique  groups,  the  banks  of  which  are  high,  but  slope  grad- 
ually  to   the   water's  edge.    There  are   a   number  of   undeveloped   water  powers   in. 


Michigan  by  Counties.  253 

this  county,  the  one  at  the  outlet  of  North  Manistique  lake  having  a  current 
of  four  miles  an  hour,  and  is  sufficiently  large  to  furnish  power  for  any  number 
of   mills. 

The  soil  is  generally  clay,  limestone,  gravel  and  loam,  with  a  subsoil  of  lime- 
stone. Here  and  there  will  be  found  a  rich  sandy  loam  of  a  chocolate  color 
over  a  clay  subsoil.  The  Manistique  lake  region  having  as  its  northern  boundary 
the  Duluth,  South  Shore  tt  Atlantic  Railroad,  and  Lake  Michigan  on  the  south, 
has  in  many  places  a  rich  vegetable  mold  on  the  surface,  underneath  which  is 
found  a  layer  of  red  clay,  then  white  marl  containing  a  large  percentage  of 
lime,  and  lastly  a  white  clay  resting  on  a  limestone  foundation.  The  timber  is 
principally  pine,  cedar,  white  birch,  poplar  and  tamarack,  the  last  three  varieties 
being  found  in  large  quantities  along  the  streams.  On  the  dryer  lands  are 
splendid  tracts  of  birds-eye  and  curly  maple,  black  and  yellow  birch,  beech, 
basswood,  etc. 

The  agricultural  lands  of  this  county  cannot  be  excelled  in  richness  of  soil  or 
in  producing  qualities.  Wheat,  barley,  oats,  buckwheat,  hay,  potatoes,  turnips, 
etc.,  all  grow  in  great  abundance  and  of  the  finest  quality.  The  vegetables  are 
especially  productive  and  attain  an  enormous  size.  Peas  could  be  raised  for 
southern  markets  with  great  profit,  as  they  are  about  three  weeks  later  than 
southern  peas.  As  soon  as  the  beaver  dams  are  destroyed  which  are  now  scat- 
tered over  the  so-called  swamp  lands,  the  drainage  will  be  perfect  and  there 
will  be  left  some  of  the  best  grass  land  in  the  country.  Near  St.  Ignace 
tobacco  is  raised  to  a  limited  extent.  On  Mackinac  island  tine  plums  have  been 
raised  for  years.  On  the  main  land  any  number  of  blue  plums,  which  were 
doubtless  planted  by  the  early  French  settlers,  are  found  growing  in  a  wild 
state.  Strawberries,  cranberries,  etc.,  gi'ow  to  great  perfection.  Young  orchards  , 
set  out  six  and  eight  years  ago  now  bear  fruit  in  gratifying  quantities.  There 
are  a  dozen  thrifty  apple  orchards  in  St.  Ignace.  Siberian  crabs,  pears,  green 
gage  and  egg  plums  and  cherry  trees  not  only  endure  the  winter  well,  but 
thrive   and   bear   fruit   seemingly   as   well    as   in   lower   latitudes. 

The  cost  of  clearing,  averages  $20  per  acre  on  the  heavier  timbered  lands, 
while  on  the  "burnt  lands"  it  will  not  exceed  $5  or  $10.  Good  wood  markets 
can  be  found  along  the  line  of  the  railroad,  particularly  at  the  furnaces  in  St. 
Jgnace  and  Newberry.  The  roads  of  the  county  are  very  good  indeed.  Snow- 
falls by  December  1  to  an  average  depth  of  two  feet,  the  ground  never  freez- 
ing. The  winters  are  steady,  and  the  atmosphere  is  much  drier  than  in  southern 
Michigan.  Plowing  begins  in  April,  and  although  the  season  is  comparatively 
short,  the  growth  of  crops  is  much  quicker  than  in  lower  latitvides.  the  lime 
in   the  soil   giving   it   great   vigor. 

Lumbering,  the  cutting  of  ties,  posts,  poles,  etc.,  charcoal  burning  and  agri- 
culture are  the  main  industries,  employing  a  large  number  of  men  at  wages 
ranging  from  81.50  to  S1.75  per  day.  The  Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp;  Atlantic 
Railroad  traverses  the  county  from  southeast  to  northwest,  and  an  extension 
from  the  vicinity  of  Newberry  to  the  Sault  connects  St.  Ignace  with  the  Soo. 
The  St.  Paul.  Minneapolis  &amp;  Sault  Ste.  Marie  Railroad  crosses  the  county  east 
and  west,  starting  into  life  the  thriving  towns  of  Gilchrist,  Naubinway,  Gould 
City  and  Corinne.  Theee  roads  have  opened  up  a  vast  amount  of  hitherto 
undeveloped  territory,  which  is  soon  to  become  the  home  of  the  farmer,  the 
merchant   and   the   manvifacturer. 

MACOMB   COUNTY. 
BY    ROBERT    T.    ELDRIDGE,    MT.    CLEMENS. 

Macomb  county  was  organized  in  1818,  and  primarily  included  all  the  land  now 
embraced  in  the  counties  of  St.  Clair.  Lapeer,  Macomb,  Oakland,  Livingston,  the 
larger  part  of  Shiawassee,  Ingham.  Genesee.  Sanilac  and  small  portions  of 
Huron.  Tuscola  and  Saginaw.  It  was  the  third  county  in  the  State  to  be  organized. 
It  has  been  repeatedly  reduced  until  the  present  county  has  an  area  of  440  square 
miles,  with  a  population,  in  1890,  of  31,813.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Lapeer 
and  St.  Clair  counties,  east  by  St.  Clair  county  and  Lake  St.  Clair,  south  by 
Wayne  and  west  by  Oakland.  Mt.  Clemens,  its  metropolis  and  county  seat,  is  a 
flourishing  city  of  about  5,000  population,  in  which  are  situated  the  famous  mineral 
springs,  whose  waters   are  renowned  and  attract    thousands  annually  from  all  parts 


254  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

of  the  country.  The  waters  are  especially  effective  in  the  treatment  of  rheumatism,, 
skin  and  blood  diseases  and  nervous  affections.  Five  large  bath  houses  and  many 
hotel  and  boarding  houses  stand  as  evidences  of  the  wonderful  success  of  the  waters.. 
The  leading  manufactories  in  the  city  are  of  lumber,  sash,  blinds,  etc.,  agricultural 
implements,  including  threshers,  staves  and  heading,  and  ship  building.  Quite  an 
amount  is  invested  in  the  vessel  interests  on  the  great  lakes  by  the  people  of  the 
city,  as  well  as  of  New  Baltimore. 

The  northern  and  western  portions  of  the  county  are  quite  rolling,  with  consider- 
able cobblestone,  while  the  remainder  of  the  county  is  level  or  only  slightly  undu- 
lating. The  Clinton  river,  with  its  numerous  branches  and  feeders,  furnish  excellent 
drainage  to  the  larger  part  of  the  county,  and  good  water  power  at  Utica  and  other 
points.  The  low  swampy  lands  of  the  southern  portions  have  been  drained  largely 
and  now  furnish  the  most  productive  farms  of  the  county,  so  that  now  the  only 
waste  lands  are  the  marshes  at  the  outlet  of  the  streams  along  the  shore  of  Lake 
St.  Clair.  The  soil  of  the  northwestern  portion  of  the  county  is  a  gravelly  loam, 
while  that  of  the  south  and  east  portions  is  gravel  and  sand  with  clay  and  clay 
loam  subsoil.  The  timber,  once  abounding,  is  now  nearly  all  cleared  off.  The- 
resources  of  the  county  are  almost  entirely  agricultural,  wheat,  oats  and  hay  being 
the  chief  products.  Some  fine  cattle  are  being  bred  in  the  county,  and  the  improve- 
ment in  the  grade  of  the  stock  in  general  has  been  marked.  Apples,  pears,  plums, 
and  small  fruits  are  raised  successfully  in  nearly  all  parts  of  the  county. 

Improved  lands  range  in  price  from  830  to  SlOO  per  acre,  and  the  lands  along  the 
southern  line  command  even  higher  prices,  being  purchased  as  prospective  subur- 
ban residence  property  for  Detroiters.  The  Grand  Trunk,  its  Ridgway  &amp;  Pontiac 
branch,  and  the  Detroit  &amp;  Bay  City  branch  of  the  Michigan  Central  are  the  rail- 
roads of  the  county.  There  is  projected  a  railroad  up  the  lake  shore  from  Detroit 
to  Port  Huron.  The  Clinton  river  is  navigable  for  small  vessels  as  far  up  as  Mt. 
Clemens. 

The  press  is  represented  in  the  county  by  the  Press  and  Monitor  at  Mt.  Clemens, 
the  Hydrant  and  Observer  at  Romeo,  the  Review  at  Richmond,  the  Sentinel  at 
Utica,  the  Graphic  at  Armada,  and  the  Watchman  at  Warren. 

The  schools  of  the  county  are  very  good,  there  being  10  graded  schools  in  the 
county  and  113  school  districts  with  houses  and  fair  equipments.  The  high  schools 
at  Mt.  Clemens,  Utica  and  Romeo  are  on  the  list  of  schools  whose  graduate's  are 
admitted  to  the  University  without  examination. 

The  early  settlements  of  the  French  along  Lake  St.  Clair  and  the  Clinton,  and 
of  the  Moravians  at  Frederick,  the  struggles  of  the  early  English  settlers,  the 
enterprises  at  Bellvidere  and  Liverpool,  of  the  Kalamazoo  and  Clinton  canal,, 
and  the  like,  furnish  an  inviting  and  rich  field  for  the  work  of  the  lotal  historian 
or  of  the  story  writer. 

MANISTEE  COUNTY. 

Manistee  county  was  organized  in  1855.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Benzie,, 
on  the  east  by  Wexford,  on  the  south  by  Mason  and  Lake,  and  on  the  west  by 
Lake  Michigan.  It  has  an  area  of  349.214  acres  and  had  a  population,  in  1890,  of 
24,230.  Manistee,  a  city  of  12,812  inhabitants  located  on  Lake  Michigan,  is  the 
county  seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  greatly  diversified,  that  portion  lying  south  of  the 
Manistee  river  being  comparatively  level,  while  the  portion  lying  north  of  that  river 
is  quite  rolling.  The  two  northern  tiers  of  towns  are  very  hilly  in  some  parts, 
although  easy  of  cultivation.  The  county  is  well  watered,  both  by  streams,  and  by 
lakes  and  ponds.  The  Manistee,  a  large  navigable  stream,  crosses  the  county  from 
east  to  west.  This  river  has  three  large  tributaries  on  the  south,  and  one  on  tho 
north,  viz:  Bear  creek  which  in  turn  has  a  number  of  small  tributaries,  and  extends 
diagonally  across  the  country  to  the  northeast.  There  is  some  water  power  but  it 
is  not  available  at  present,  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  streams  are  so  jammed  with 
logs.  There  are  some  sand  plains  in  the  southern  part  of  the  county,  also  swamps 
here  and  there  which  are  easily  reclaimed.  The  soil  is  generally  a  sandy  or  gravelly 
loam,  mixed  with  more  or  less  clay.  Some  tracts  along  the  shore  have  a  pure  clay 
soil  hundreds  of  feet  in  depth.  The  southern  tier  of  towns  are  quite  sandy,  yet  the 
soil  is  quite  productive.  Pine  and  oak  timber  predominate  in  the  southern  part 
of  the  county,  white  beech,  maple,  elm,  and  ash  of  the  finest  quality  abound 
in  the  northern  portions.  Nearly  every  crop  known  in  Michigan  grows  success- 
fully  in   this  county;    late   corn   is  the  only   exception.     Wheat  averages  from   15- 


Michigan  by  Counties.  255 

to  18  bushels  to  the  acre.  Apples,  pears,  peaches,  grapes,  and  plums  do  remark- 
ably well.  Berries  of  all  sorts  are  indigenous  and  grow  abundantly  on  every 
hand.  On  the  light  soil  of  the  southern  tiers  of  townships  strawberries,  rasp- 
berries,  blackberries,   etc.,  grow   to  great   perfection. 

On  the  heavily  timbered  lands  in  the  north  part  of  the  county  the  cost  of 
clearing  would  be  considerable,  but  in  every  instance  the  wood  and  timber 
would  pay  for  the  clearing.  There  are  good  wood  piers  all  along  Lake  Michigan, 
at  Burnham,  Pierpont,  Arcadia,  Bear  Lake,  Portage  and  Manistee.  The  Milwaukee 
market  consumes  a  great  deal  of  wood  shipped  from  this  county.  There  is  9,418 
acres  of  public   lands  subject   to   sale   or   entry. 

There  are  plenty  of  good  unimproved  lands  near  the  markets  which  can  be 
had  at  from  $5  to  820  per  acre.  There  are  also  large  tracts  of  stump  land 
which  can  be  bought  at  from  $1  to  $10  per  acre.  The  soil  on  these  lands  is 
light  but  produces  good  crops  of  vegetables,  fruits,  etc.  Two  State  roads  traverse 
the  county  from  south  to  north,  one  keeping  near  the  lake  shore,  the  other 
extending  from  Manistee  to  Bear  lake,  and  thence  north  across  the  county. 
The   local   highways   are  generally  in   a  fair  condition. 

The  climate  is  equable,  and  free  from  the  extremes  of  heat  and  cold.  The 
mercury  seldom  goes  below  zero  in  winter  or  abovs  80°  in  summer.  Considerable 
snow  falls,  and  the  ground  seldom  freezes.  Plowing  begins  by  the  middle  of 
April. 

The  county  is  well  supplied  with  schools  of  a  high  grade.  The  public  schools 
of  Manistee  are  favorably  known  and  well  patronized  by  northwestern  Michigan. 
The  principal  interests  are  lumbering,  agriculture,  the  manufacture  of  salt, 
shingles,  ties,  posts  and  telegraph  poles.  There  are  about  40  lumber  and  shingle 
mills  at  Manistee.  Labor  is  in  good  demand  at  remunerative  prices.  Skilled 
labor  in  particular  is  well  paid.  The  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  railroad  has  a 
branch  from  Buttars  Junction  in  Mason  county  to  Manistee.  The  Chicago  &amp; 
West  Michigan  and  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroads  will  eventually  have 
branches   to   that   city.     A   local   road   extends  from   Pierpont   to   Bear  Lake. 

The  county  is  settling  rapidly  and  offers  every  opportunity  to  settlers,  whether 
farmers,  mechanics  or  laborers.  Lands  are  cheap,  the  soil  is  productive,  the 
privileges  of  schools  and  society  dxe  unsurpassed,  and  a  large  immigration  to 
this   section   may   be   looked  for   during   the   next   few   years. 

MANITOU  COUNTY. 

Manitou  county  was  organized  in  1855.  It  comprises  a  number  of  islands  lying 
in  the  northeastern  part  of  Lake  Michigan.  Big  Beaver,  Garden  and  Hog  islands 
form  the  northern,  and  the  north  and  south  Manitous  the  southern  boundaries  of 
the  county,  while  the  north  and  south  Fox  islands  lie  midway  between  these 
groups.  The  county  has  an  area  of  180  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890 
of  860.  Big  Beaver  island  is  the  largest  of  the  group,  and  is  divided  into  three 
townships,  viz:  Chandler,  Peaine  and  Galilee.  St.  James  at  the  northern  extremity 
of  this  island  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  rolling,  and  is  well 
watered.  There  are  a  few  easily  reclaimed  swamps  and  small  areas  of  sand  plains. 
The  soil  is  generally  quite  productive.  The  timber  is  principally  beech,  maple,  birch 
and  hemlock.  Wheat,  oats,  rye  and  potatoes  are  the  staple  crops.  The  seasons  are 
too  short  and  cool  for  corn.  Apples  do  well,  and  other  fruits,  when  properly  tested, 
will  no  doubt  show  encouraging  results.  Berries  grow  in  a  wild  state  and  yield 
bountifully.  It  costs  about  $12  per  acre  to  clear  and  fence  land.  Hardwood  brings 
from  $2  to  $2.50  per  cord,  and  softwood  about  half  as  much.  There  is  4,990  acres 
subject  to  sale  or  entry.  Good  unimproved  lands  can  be  obtained  at  from  §2.50  to 
S3  per  acre.  There  are  no  State  roads,  but  plenty  of  good  local  roads  over  the 
islands. 

Snow  falls  by  Oct.  1,  and  attains  an  average  depth  of  three  feet,  the  ground 
seldom  freezing.  Plowing  begins  by  the  20th  of  April  in  favorable  seasons.  The 
schools  are  few,  but  are  in  a  good  condition.  The  principal  industries  are  agricult- 
ure, fishing  and  boat  making.  More  fish  are  shipped  from  these  islands  than  from 
any  other  point  on  the  lake.  There  is  but  little  demand  for  labor.  During  the 
season  for  navigation,  commmunication  is  had  with  Petoskey,  Harbor  Springs  and 
other  shore  towns  by  means  of  fishing  boats  and  tugs.  Large  steamers  also  call  at 
St.  James  weekly,  connecting  the  islands  with  Mackinaw  and  Petoskey. 

The  harbor  at  St.  James  is  one  of  the  best,  if  not  the  best  on  Lake  Michigan,

MARQUETTE   COUNTl',       " 
^y   GEO.  A.    NEWETT,    OF   ISHPE3fflMG, 

Marquette  county  was  organized  in  1851.  Its  boundaries  are  Lake  S'opeuior  and 
Baraga  upon  the  north.  Schoolcraft  and  Delta  upon  tbe-  sast.  Delta,  Menomiiuee- 
and  Dickinson  upon  the  south,  and  Dickinson,  Irpn  an&lt;fl  Baraga  upon  the  west. 
Marquette  City,  located  upon  the  shore  of  Lake  Superior.,  i's  the  county  seat.  In. 
the  northern  portion  the  county  is  mountainous,  rugged  Mills  being  covered  with' 
timber  native  to  the  region,  where  there  are  numerous  liakes  abounding  in  food 
fish,  and  where  a  natural  paradise  can  be  had  by  those  seeking  rest  from  thesullbry 
sun  of  places  farther  south  and  of  less  altitude.  In  the-  central  portion  of  thie 
county  occur  the  mines  which  provide  the  chief  support  of  this  district.  The  minea 
of  iron  ore  are  numerous,  the  deposits  wonderfully  large  andi  of  rare  purity,  yimce' 
their  opening  the  total  tonnage  sent  out  to  the  markets  of  the  sounty  have  amouiQitedi 
to  37,761,828  long  tons.  It  is  pertinent  to  add  that  they  show  better  in  largg' bodies 
of  ore  at  this  time  than  at  any  previous  one  in  their  history.  Besides  the  mdiniesi 
of  Iron  ore  there  are  those  of  gold  and  silver,  galena,  and  ♦juairries  of  brownstoce, 
marole  and  talc.  The  northern  and  central  jjortions  of  the  county  are  liiaaibere^ 
with  white  pine,  Norway  pine,  hemlock,  cedar,  spruce,  tamarack,  maple,  aad  whit®' 
yellow  and  black  birch,  and  many  mills  are  employed  in  reducing  them  to  mjercaia- 
tile  proportions.  The  railroads  traversing  the  county  are  the  Duluth,  South  Shore 
&amp;  Atlantic,  the  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern,  the  Chicago,  Milwaukee  it  St.  Pa^Jill,  anici 
the  Huron  Bay.  Large  tracts  suitable  for  farming  purposes  are  found  in  tfee  liainds 
in  the  central  region  of  the  county.  Apples,  cherries,  currants,  raspberries,  huckle-- 
berries,  strawberries,  etc.,  thrive  to  a  remarkable  degree.  Say  is  a  protitabie  crop,, 
oats  and  barley  do  well,  while  roots,  such  as  turnips,  beets,  carrots,  parsnips,  etc,. 
grow   to  perfection. 

Potatoes  are  a  sure  crop,  and  are  of  the  finest  quality  and  size.  The  g:i-asses  ar© 
wonderfully  nutricious.  and  vegetables  of  all  kinds  native  to  the  district  are  won- 
derfully developed.  Ishpeming  is  the  largest  city  in  the  county,  containing  a  pop^ 
ulation  of  11,194;  Marquette  comes  next  with  8,987,  and  Negaunee  third  with  6,053. 
The  schools  of  the  county  compare  favorably  with  the  best  in  the  country,  and  no 
portion  of  the  State  is  more  liberal  in  providing  facilities  for  the  ediacation  of  its 
children. 

There  are  rare  advantages  for  the  conducting  of  various  factoiies  for  the  manu- 
facture of  wooden  ware,  and  a  line  field  for  furnaces  and  mills  for  the  convei-sion 
of  the  iron  ore  to  manufactured  forms.  Marquette  counly  has  an  area  of  1.071.42fi 
acres,  being  the  largest  county  in  the  State  and  tenth  in  point  of  wealth.  There 
are  91,5-16  acres  of  public  lands  subject  to  sale  or  entry. 

BY   E.    A.    PAEKER,   OF   MARQUETTE. 

Marquette  county  consists  of  approximately  1,071,426  acres,  of  which  100,000  acres 
have  been  cut.  There  are  about  10,000  acres  under  cultivation,  and  such  land  is 
worth  about  S25  per  acre.  Timber  land  has  an  average  of  $10  per  acre.  The  woods 
found  consist  of  pine,  spruce,  hemlock,  cedar,  tamarack,  elm.  ash.  and  hard  and 
soft  bird's-eye  maple  and  curly  maple.  The  soil  is  usually  sandy  sometimes  clayey 
and  loamy,  the  general  country  consists  of  low,  rolling  hills.  The  saw  mill  industry 
has  $628,000  invested  in  plants.  There  is  one  blast  furnace  in  operation  using 
charcoal,  having  two  stacks,  one  stack  producing  fifty  and  the  other  seventy-five 
tons  pig  iron  daily.  There  are  about  50.000  horse  power  in  its  streams.  Of  this 
amount  only  600  is  utilized,  this  being  done  by  the  city  of  Marquette  for  its  electric 
light  and  to  operate  a  flour  mill.  Mining  is  the  principal  industry  of  the  county. 
During  the  past  year  the  mines  of  this  county  stiipped  2.674,2.33  tons  of  iron  ore. 
and    since   the   first   shipments  of   ore   were   made   has   sent   away    37,924,968   tons.

The  railroads  of  the  county  are  the  Trunk  system  of  the  Canadian  Pacific,  by  its 
line  of  the  Duluth.  South  Shore  et  Atlantic  (travei-sing  the  south  shore  of  Lake 
Superior),  the  Chicago  &amp;  Northwestern,  and  Chicago.  Milwaukee  &amp;  St.  Paul.  In 
addition  the  plans  and  estimates  have  been  made  for  a  road  to  operate  between 
Ishpeming  and  Marquette,  a  distance  of  fifteen  miles  to  caray  ore.  It  will  afford 
Marquette  an  additional  outlet  for  its  products  and  give  access  by  two  roads  to 
the  markets  of  the  west.  There  is  one  stone  quarry  operating  near  the  city  of 
Marquette  that  has  been  shipping  its  celebrated  "rain  drop'"  and  brown  stone  for 
thirty  years.  North  and  west  of  Ishpeming  are  hills  of  serpentine.  It  polishes 
beautifull}-   and    is  an  industry  that  will  attract  capital. 

The  chief  cities  are  Ishpeming.  population  1890  census,  11.197;  Marquette.  9,093; 
Negaunee.  0.078;  total  population  in  the  three  cities,  26..368.  In  the  county  the 
census  showed  that  there  were  39,527  inhabitants,  being  a  gain  of  over  eight 
thousand  in  six  years  and  over  fourteen  thousand  in  ten  years. 

The  fishing  catch  at  the  port  of  Marquette  amounted  to  177,000  in  1891.  There 
is  about  S2G,000  invested  in  the  business.  The  catch  consists  mainly  of  whitefish 
and  lake  trout. 

The  vessel  interests  or  tonnage  of  the  port  showed  in  1890,  1.540  arrivals  of  ves- 
sels; the  tonnage  amounted  to  3,077,566  tons,  an  average  of  1,061  tons.  The  imports 
were  178.0.36  tons. 

The  school  statistics  of  the  county  are  as  follows:

The  game  consists  of  rabbit,  partridges,  deer  and  bear.  Wolves,  otter,  beaver,  mink, 
muskrats  and  other  fur-bearing  animals  are  trapped.  Speckled  brook  trout  are 
plentiful  in  the  streams,  and  Lake  Superior  affords  fishing  grounds  for  them  second  to 
no  place  in  the  United  States. 

MASON  COUNTY. 


Mason  county  was  organized  in  1855.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Manistee, 
on  the  east  by  Lake,  on  the  south  by  Oceana,  and  on  the  west  by  Lake  Mich- 
igan. It  has  an  area  of  504  square  miles,  and  had,  in  1890.  a  population  of 
16,385.  .  Ludington,  a  city  of  7,517  inhabitants,  located  on  Lake  Michigan,  is  the 
county   seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  i-oUing.  It  is  well  watered,  three  streams  run- 
ning east  and  west  through  the  county,  viz:  the  Grand  Sable,  the  Little  Sable, 
and  the  Marquette.  The  southern  portion  of  the  county  is  drained  by  the  Pent 
water  river,  flowing  into  Lake  Michigan  in  the  northeast  corner  of  Oceana 
county.  There  is  considerable  swamp  land,  nearly  all  of  which  is  reclaimal&gt;le 
and  which  will  ultimately  prove  among  the  best  lands  in  the  county.  The  east- 
ern tier  of  towns  is  qviite  sandy,  but  there  are  but  few  sand  plains,  properly 
so  called.  The  soil  in  one-half  of  the  county  is,  a  sandy  loam,  in  one-quarter 
sand,  and  in  the  remaining  (juarter  clay.  The  subsoil  varies  from  hard  clay  to  sand 
thirty  feet  in  depth.  The  timber  is  principally  beech  and  maple,  ash,  JDasswoo^l, 
hemlock,  some  pine  and  the  other  varieties  usually  found  in  northern  Michigan. 
The  main  crops  are  wheat,  oats,  potatoes,  and  all  kinds  of  vegetables.  Som'&gt; 
years   wheat   will   average  20    to    25    bushels    per    acre.      Fruit    raising    has    been

thoroughly  tested,  and  peaches,  pears,  plums  and  apples  grow  to  great  perfec- 
tion.   The   Chicago  and  Milwaukee  markets  consume   all   of   the  surplus   fruit. 

The  cost  of  clearing  will  average  from  $20  to  825  per  acre.  There  are  good 
wood  markets  at  all  of  the  railroad  towns,  hardwood  bringing  from  S2.50 
to  S3.50  per  cord,  and  softwood  from  81.25  to  81.50.  There  are  2,780  acres 
of  public  lands  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  Good  unimproved  lands  can 
be  had  at  from  86  to  825  per  acre.  These  lands  are  all  accessible  to  market 
and  their  nearness  to  Pentwater,  Ludington  and  Manistee  will  cause  a  brisk 
demand  for  everything  the  settler  may  have  to  offer  for  sale.  The  '•  stump  lands  " 
are  held  at  merely  nominal  prices.  The  soil  is  fair,  and  eventually  they  will 
develop  into  fine  agricultural  districts.  There  are  two  State  roads  running 
through  the  county,  one  running  from  Ludington  due  east,  and  the  other  from 
Manistee  in  a  southerly  direction.  The  local  highways  are  improving  each  year. 
Snow  falls  early  in  December,  having  an  average  depth  during  the  season  of 
two  feet,  the  ground  seldom  freezing.  Spring  work  commences  as  soon  as  the 
snow   leaves,   usually  by   April   15. 

The  schools  of  the  county  are  in  a  good  condition,  and  are  multiplying 
rapidly.  The  principal  industries  are  farming,  lumbering,  and  the  getting  out 
of  poles,  ties,  posts,  and  hemlock  bark.  Labor  is  in  good  demand,  820  to  830 
per  month  being  the  average  prices  paid  common  labor.  The  Flint  &amp;  Pere 
Marquette,  its  Manistee  branch,  and  the  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan  railroads 
afford  excellent  outlets  for  the  products  of  the  county.  Ludington  is  a  shipping 
point  of  considerable  prominence,  and  during  the  season  for  navigation  is  regu- 
larly visited  by   the  largest  boats  on  the  lakes. 

MECOSTA   COUNTY. 
BY   S.    G.    WEBSTEE,    BIG   RAPIDS. 

Located  in  the  middle  division  of  the  lower  peninsula,  was  organized  in  1859. 
It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Osceola,  east  by  Isabella,  south  by  Montcalm,  and 
on  the  west  by  Newaygo  county.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles  and  a  pop- 
ulation in  1890  of  19.647.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  slightly  rolling  and  the 
soil  rich  and  productive  of  all  kinds  of  crops.  The  timber  is  largely  beech  and 
sugar  maple,  elm,  ash,  oak,  and  cherry,  with  much  valuable  cedar  along  the  banks 
of  streams  and  around  its  many  beautiful  inland  lakes. 

Mecosta  is  already  supplied  with  railroads,  and  others  now  proposed  and  surveyed 
will  doubtless  be  built  in  the  course  of  a  few  years.  The  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana 
runs  north  and  south  through  the  county,  the  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan,  also  the 
Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern  traverse  the  county  from  the  west  and  east  with  the 
terminus  of  each  at  Big  Rapids,  the  county  seat.  The  county  is  watered  by  the 
Muskegon,  Chippewa  and  Little  Muskegon  rivers  and  their  tributaries.  Nearly 
every  farm  has  its  spring  or  spring  brook.  There  are  also  from  thirty  to  fifty 
lakes  of  clear,  cold  water,  surrounded  as  a  rule  by  high  banks.  The  lakes  abound 
in  fish,  principally  bass  and  pickerel,  while  the  brooks  swarm  with  speckled 
trout  which  thrive  in  these  waters,  and  are  kept  stocked  from  the  State  fish  hatchery 
located  at  Paris  in  this  county.  All  the  rivers  and  small  creeks  have  as  yet  many 
undeveloped  water  power  sites.  The  county  may  well  boast  of  its  abundant  supply 
of  pure  water  and  the  health  of  its  inhabitants.  There  is  no  government  land 
in  the  market.  Good  unimproved  lands,  well  timbered  with  beech,  maple,  etc.,  near  a 
railroad,  can  be  had  at  from  85  to  812.50  per  acre,  while  much  of  the  "stump  lands"' 
with  a  heavy  clay  subsoil,  which  make  fine  productive  farms,  can  be  purchased 
at  from  81  to  85  per  acre,  thereby  offering  inducements  to  those  with  small  means 
to  secure  cheap  but  valuable  farms.  Single  crops  of  potatoes  have  been  raised 
on  a  few  acres  of  these  lands  and  sold  for  sufficient  to  pay  the  purchase  price 
of  the  entire  farm.  The  main  productions  are  corn,  oats,  wheat,  potatoes  and 
grass.  Hay  is  a  sure  and  profitable  crop.  Timothy  and  the  finer  grasses,  partic- 
ularly red  clover,  which  grows  luxuriantly,  being  the  favorite  varieties.  All  find 
a  ready  and  easy  market  at  remunerative  prices.  Experience  has  demonstrated 
that  all  kinds  of  'fruits  can  be  raised  in  abundance,  not  only  apples,  but  plume, 
pears,  cherries,  grapes,  etc.,  have  proved  a  great  success,  being  very  fine  in  appear- 
ance and  quality,  while  the  trees  are  vigorous  and  thrifty,  growing  rapidly  they 
come  into  bearing  early.  Those  who  have  been  experimenting  with  peaches  are 
convinced   that   this  locality  is  in   the  great  peach  belt  of  Michigan,  and  the  slope- 


Michigan  by  Counties.  259 

of  the  hill  sides  are  being  set  out  largely  to  peaches,  and  soon  the  county 
will  take  rank  as  one  of  the  first  fruit  growing  counties  in  Michigan,  the  southern 
peninsula  of  which  is  destined  to  be  the  garden  fruit  belt  of  the  world. 

Big  Rapids,  the  county  seat,  as  a  manufacturing  city,  is  growing  in  prosperity 
and  popularity  and  has  a  water  power  second  to  none.  The  Muskegon  river  with  a 
sixteen-foot  fall  and  two  dams  within  the  city  limits,  furnishes  power  sufficient 
to  drive  the  wheels  of  almost  an  unlimited  number  of  factories,  which  with  its 
railroad  facilities  and  special  inducements  offered  by  the  business  men  of  the  city 
for  new  enterprises,   afford   great  opportunities  to   those   seeking   new   locations. 

The  city  contains  a  fine  modern  court  house  erected  at  an  expense  of  840,000 
and  a  jail  costing  S15,000,  two  iron  bridges  costing  818,000  and  822,000  respectively. 

The  educational  advantages  are  the  pride  of  the  county  and  city.  Big  Rapids 
is  noted  for  its  schools.  A  central  building,  erected  at  a  cost  of  820,000,  and  three 
ward  buildings  at  85.000  to  88.000  each.  The  Ferris  Industrial  College,  a  new 
commodious  structure  costing  $20,000,  although  of  only  a  few  years'  existence, 
has  already  secured  a  national  reputation,  and  with  its  attendance  of  several  hun- 
dred students  from  the  different  states  of  the  Union,  has  already  earned  its  title 
of    being   one  of    the  best   liberal   educational   schools  in   the  country. 

MENOMINEE   COUNTY. 

Menominee  county  was  organized  in  1863.  It  contains  an  area  of  667,15.3  acres, 
and  in  1890  had  a  population  of  .33,6.39,  an  increase  in  ten  years  of  21,6.52.  Menominee 
city  in  1890  had  a  population  of  10,6.30  and  is  the  county  seat.  Located  at  the  extreme 
southern  point  of  the  county,  at  the  mouth  of  the  Menominee  river  on  Green  bay, 
it  occupies  a  place  in  front  rank  of  lumber  producing  cities,  in  fact  is  claimed 
to  be  the  first.  With  excellent  shipping  facilities,  both  by  rail  and  water,  the  advan- 
tages of  the  locality  for  manufacturing  are  excellent. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  rolling  with  some  swamp  which  is  reclaimable 
by  drainage.  It  is  nicely  drained  by  the  Menominee.  Sturgeon,  Cedar  rivers,  and 
numerous  creeks  and  small  streams.  The  soil  is  somewhat  sandy  with  clay  subsoil, 
quite  productive  and  easily  tilled.  Heretofore  the  land  has  been  valued  in  proportion 
to  its  timber,  but  the  greatest  value  is  not  in  the  timber.  It  is  true  that  the  wealth  in 
timber  can  soonest  be  reached,  and  is  generally  held  by  persons  who  care  but  little 
for  the  fate  of  the  land  after  they  have  made  their  fortunes  by  stripping  the 
timber  off.  However  this  cannot  be  prevented.  This  is  not  a  case  of  killing  the 
goose  that  laid  the  golden  egg,  for  after  the  land  is  denuded  of  its  productive  grand 
forests  it  is  yet  good,  and  when  cultivated  intelligently  with  skilled  hands, 
rich  harvests  will  be  gathered,  and  Menominee  instead  of  being  a  city  of  transient 
interests  will  count  its  permanent  manufacturing  industries,  its  prosperous  surround- 
ing farms  and  its  permanent  and  reliable  citizenship. 

Of  its  entire  area  44,189  acres  are  in  farms.  604,116  acres  uncultivated  and  18,848 
acres  held  by  the  State  and  general  government  and  subject  to  entry  or  sale.  Not 
one-tenth  part  of  the  land  is  farmed.  This  looks  like  an  opening  for  persons  wanting 
cheap  farms  and  we  know  of  no  reason  why  the  investment  would  not  be  good. 
With  good  land,  good  markets,  healthy  climate,  cheap  homes,  with  plenty  of  wood 
for  fuel,   what   is   the  matter  of    Menominee  county? 

MIDLAND  COUNTY. 

Midland  county  was  organized  in  18.55.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Gladwin, 
on  the  east  by  Bay,  on  the  south  by  Gratiot  and  Saginaw,  and  on  the  west  by  Isa- 
bella. It  has  an  area  of  504  square  miles,  and  had  in  1890  a  population  of  10,657. 
Midland,  a  city  of  2,277  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat.  The  surface  of  the  county 
is  slightly  rolling,  excepting  the  extreme  southern  portion,  where  it  is  quite  level. 
It  IS  well  watered  by  the  Tittabawassee.  Chippewa,  Pine,  Salt  and  Tobacco  rivers, 
and  the  small  streams'tributary  to  them.  There  is  plenty  of  available  water  power 
throughout  the  county.  There  are  no  swamps  of  any  size,  and  no  sand  plains. 
The  soil  of  the  southern  portion  of  the  county  is  mostly  clay;  that  of  the 
northern  part  is  a  clay  loam,  while  the  western  and  eastern  portions  have  a  sandy 
loam.  A  clay  subsoil  underlies  the  entire  county.  The  timber  is  mostly  beech, 
maple,  ash,  oak,  birch,  elm.  pine  and  hemlock.  The  principal  crops  are  wheat, 
oats,  corn,  barley,  roots  of  all  kinds,  and  especially  hay.  Every  fruit  that  has  been 
tried  has  grown  successfully.     Apples,  plums  and  other  small  fruits  have  invariably 


•260  Michigan  and   its  Resources. 

done  well.  There  can  be  no  doubt  but  that  fruit  will  be  one  of  the  staples  of  Midland 
county.  The  cost  of  clearing:  will  average  from  $10  to  $12  per  acre.  There  is  a  good 
demand  for  wood  at  the  salt  blocks  and  bromine  works  in  Midland  City.  Hardwood, 
eighteen  inches  in  length,  brings  $1.50  per  cord;  softwood  averages  $1.2.'5. 

There  is  no  government  land  in  the  market.  One  thousand  and  twenty-eight  acres 
of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry. 

Good  unimproved  lands  are  plentiful.  They  can  be  obtained  within  a  few  miles  of 
the  settlements  at  from  $5  to  $12  per  acre.  The  "  stump  lands  "  of  this  county  have  a 
good  soil,  and  wherever  cultivated  have  produced  good  crops.  They  are  held  at  from  $4 
to  $8  per  acre.  Improved  farms  range  in  price  from  $20  to  $60  per  acre,  according  to 
their  location.  There  are  two  State  roads  leading  from  Midland  City,  one  running  in 
a  southerly  direction  to  St.  Louis,  in  Gratiot  county,  and  the  other  running  west  and 
north  to  Houghton  Lake,  in  Roscommon  county. 

Snow  falls  by  December  1.  to  an  average  depth  of  one  foot.  Spring  work  commences 
in  May.  The  winters  are  generally  steadier  in  this  latitude  than  in  the  southern  part 
of  the  State.  The  schools  of  the  county  are  numerous  and  excellent.  At  Midland 
City  there  is  a  $20,000  school  building,  and  every  effort  is  made  to  have  the  standard 
compare  favorably  with  that  of  any  city  in  the  State. 

Agriculture,  lumbering,  the  manufacture  of  salt  and  bromine,  charcoal  burning,  and 
the  cutting  of  ties,  posts  and  telegraph  poles,  are  the  principal  industries  of  the  county. 
The  is  a  good  demand  for  common  and  skilled  labor.  The  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette 
Railroad  crosses  the  county  from  southeast  to  northwest.  There  are  several  logging 
roads  in  the  northern  part  of  the  county  and  a  road  between  Midland  and  Bay  City. 

MISSAUKEE    COUNTY. 
BY    A.    G,    SMITH,    LAKE    CITY. 

Missaukee  county  was  organized  in  1871.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Kalkaska, 
on  the  east  by  Roscommon,  on  the  south  by  Osceola  and  Clare,  and  on  the  west 
by  Wexford.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of 
5,048.  Lake  City,  the  county  seat,  is  a  wide-awake  village  and  had  663  population 
in  1890.  Beautifully  located  on  the  east  shore  of  Musk-rat  lake,  the  place  is  built 
with  good  substantial  buildings,  has  four  saw  mills  and  one  planing  mill,  two  banks, 
two  weekly  newspapers,  and  is  a  thriving  town  in  every  sense.  It  is  the  present 
terminus  of  the  Missaukee  branch  of  the  G.  R.  &amp;  I.  R.  R. 

Ten  miles  south  of  Lake  City  is  located  the  thriving  village  of  Mc  Bain,  lately 
incorporated.  The  principal  industries  of  the  place  are  several  hardwood  manu- 
factories.    It  is  located  on  the  T.  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  R.  R. 

Five  miles  west  of  McBain,  on  the  same  railroad,  is  the  village  of  Lucas,  also 
fast  coming  into  prominence  on  account  of  its  hardwood  manufactories. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  gently  rolling,  and  is  well  watered  by  the  Clam  and 
Muskegon  rivers,  and  by  small  lakes  and  spring  brooks  of  clear,  cold  water.  There 
is  good  water  power  to  be  found,  particularly  on  the  Clam  river.  The  soil  varies 
from  a  sand  and  sandy  loam  to  a  clay  loam,  with  a  clay  subsoil.  The  timber  on 
the  hardwood  lands  is  principally  sugar  maple,  beech,  elm,  basswood  and  hemlock. 
There  are  also  belts  of  valuable  pine  scattered  through  various  portions  of  the 
county.  The  successful  crops  are  wheat,  oats,  hay,  barley,  potatoes,  corn,  and  in 
fact  all  root  crops.  The  early  kinds  of  corn  do  well.  Apples  and  plums  are  grown 
successfully.  All  varieties  of  berries  also  grow  in  great  abundance.  Peaches,  how- 
ever, are  not  to  be  relied  on. 

The  cost  of  clearing  hardwood  land  will  average  $12  to  $15  per  acre.  The  logs 
are  in  good  demand  at  the  local  mills,  and  at  the  roll  ways  :&gt;long  the  streams,  and 
large  quantities  are  shipped  to  Grand  Rapids  to  be  manufactured  into  furniture, 
and  wood  brings  a  fair  price  in  the  several  villages  in  the  county. 

There  are  7,555  acres  of  government  and  State  land  for  sale  or  entry  in  this 
county,  also  some  G.  R.  it  I.  R.  R.  land,  which  c^n  be  bought  at  prices  ranging  from 
$1  to  $7  per  acre.  These  invariably  have  a  good  soil  and  will  develop  into  good 
agricultural  districts.  The  stump  lands,  some  of  which  are  very  desirable,  are  also 
quite  numerous,  and  can  be  had  at  from  $1  to  $5  per  acre.  There  are  five  State 
roads  running  through  the  county,  viz.:  one  north  and  south  through  the  center  of 
the  county,  one  east  and  west  from  Lake  City  to  Cadillac,  one  from  Falmouth  to 
Cadillac,  another  east  and  west  through  the  north  part  of  the  county,  and  still 
another  north  and  south  along  the  Muskegon  river.     The  townships  of   this  county 


Michigan  by   Counties.  261 

are  well  opened  by  section  line  roads.  Snow  falls  by  the  last  of  November,  the 
average  depth  of  the  season  reaching  20  inches.  The  ground  does  not  usually  freeze, 
save  in  places  where  the  wind  blows  away  the  snow.  Potatoes  are  frequently  left 
in  the  ground  all  winter.     Plowing  begins  by  the  last  of  April. 

The  people  of  Missaukee  county  have  always  shown  a  lively  interest  in  education, 
and  the  district  schools,  as  well  as  the  graded  schools  in  the  villages,  are  in  a 
thriving  condition.  Usually  the  school  buildings  are  of  good  quality,  some  of  them 
tine  brick  structvires. 

Lumbering  has  been  the  principal  industry  in  the  past,  but  agricultural  interests 
are  now  making  rapid  advancement,  and  already  there  are  a  large  number  of  as 
finely  improved  farms  as  are  found  anywhere.  Common  labor  is  always  in  good 
demand,  wages  ranging  from  $20  to  $.35  per  month,  and  there  are  tine  markets  for 
everything  that  can  be  raised. 

It  is  expected  that  the  G.  R.  &amp;  I.  Railroad  company  will  extend  their  line  to 
Moorestown  in  the  iiortheastern  part  of  the  county  in  the  near  future  and  connect 
with  a  projected  line  of  road  through  Grayling  to  Alpena. 

The  sand  on  the  bank  of  Musk-rat  lake  at  Lake  City  has  been  tested  and  found 
to  be  a  tine  quality  of  glass  sand.  Some  tine  samples  of  glass  are  are  on  exhibition 
here  made  from  a  shipment  of  sand  sent  away  as  a  test,  [t  is  thought  that  further 
experiments  will  prove  that  the  sand  will  make  plate  glass.  It  is  expected  that  a 
glass  factory  will  be  built  here  in  the  near  future. 

MONROE  COUNTY. 
BY   W.    H.    BOYD,    MONROE. 

Monroe  county  was  organized  in  1817.  and  has  fifteen  townships,  including  the 
city  of  Monroe,  which  has  four  wards.  The  county  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Wash- 
tenaw and  Wayne,  on  the  east  by  Lake  Erie,  on  the  south  by  Ohio,  and  on  the  west  by 
Lenawee  county.  It  has  an  area  of  oQi  square  miles,  and  a  population  in  1890 
of  .32,247.  Monroe  city  has  5.246  inhabitants  and  is  the  county  seat  with  a  fine 
court  house  and  jail,  also  fine  churches  and  school  buildings.  The  county  house 
and  farm  are  among  the  best  in  the  State.  The  county  is  well  watered  the 
river  Raisin  running  through  the  county  from  west  to  east,  with  numerous  branches: 
also  the  Huron  on  the  north,  with  several  creeks  running  into  Lake  Erie;  also 
artesian  wells  in  many  parts  of  the  county.  There  are  several  villages  of  size: 
Dundee,  Petersburg.  Carleton,  Milan  and  Ida,  all  growing  places.  The  eastern 
portion  is  level,  especially  along  the  lake,  where  the  soil  is  clay  loam  and  very  rich 
and  productive.  The  western  portion  is  higher  and  more  sandy,  especially  the 
southwestern,   and   easy   to   work,  and   for  some   products  equally   valuable. 

The  timber  is  composed  of  all  kinds,  except  pine,  hemlock  and  trees  of  that 
class.  Oak  of  all  kinds,  with  hickory,  maple  and  ash,  are  the  most  abundant. 
Raisin  river,  with  its  branches.  Macon,  Saline  and  others,  afford  abundant  water 
power,  especially  at  Monroe,  Dundee.  Petersburg  and  other  points  on  the  line  of 
the  river.  All  kinds  of  grain  are  largely  grown  in  all  the  towns  and  the  eastern 
portion  produces  hay  in  abundance  and  is  sold  in  the  Monroe.  Toledo  and  Detroit 
markets.  Stock  is  raised  in  all  parts  of  the  county,  and  our  markets  are  well 
supplied  with  the  choicest  beef,  mutton  and  pork,  large  quantities  of  each  both 
alive  and  slaughtered  being  shipped  on  the  railroads  east,  the  Monroe  market 
for  dressed  hogs  being  one  of  the  best  in  the  State.  There  are  extensive  fish- 
eries near  Monroe,  where  fish  are  caught  in  abundance  and  sold  fresh  and  frozen, 
which  supply  the  home  markets  and  are  shipped  to  the  interior  of  the  State. 
Fruits  of  all  kinds  are  largely  grown.  The  export  of  grapes  and  all  small  fruits 
is  large  and  of  very  fine  quality,  and  command  the  highest  price  in  the  mar- 
kets of  Detroit,  Toledo  and  Chicago,  and  are  very  profitable  to  the  producers. 
Monroe  contains  three  of  the  most  extensive  nurseries  in  the  western  States, 
and 'ships  trees  of  all  kinds  to  almost  all  the  western  states  in  large  quantities, 
the  soil  being  well  adapted  to  that  business.  The  highways  of  the  county  are 
uniformly  good  except  in  the  eastern  portion  where  the  clay  lands  abound;  they 
are  bad  in  the  rainy  season.  The  winter  seasons  vary,  though  not  more  so 
than  in  other  counties  in  the  State  and  are  not  subject  to  high  winds  or  cyclones. 
Monroe  city  has  communication  with  Lake  Erie  by  vessel  and  steamboat,  and 
large  quantities  of  lumber  and  telegraph  poles  are  brought  into  the  harbor  to  be 
sold   and  distributed  over  the  State.    The  Western  Union  Telegraph  company  have 


"262  Michigan  and  its  Resoueces. 

the  largest  depot  at  Monroe  for  poles  in  the  country,  from  which  they  supply 
their  lines.  There  are  four  large  paper  mills,  which  with  other  manufactories, 
give  employment  to  labor.  Limestone  abounds  on  the  line  of  the  river  Raisin, 
and  extensive  quarries  have  been  and  are  still  being  operated  both  for  lime  and 
building  stone,  which  are  shipped  to  Detroit  and  other  places,  besides  supplies 
for  home  demand.  There  are  no  government  lands  in  the  county.  Farm  lands 
sell  for  prices  according  to  their  situation  and  improvements,  the  best  from  $40 
to  SlOO  per  acre,  and  others  not  so  good  from  §20  to  §30.  There  is  not  now 
a  more  healthy  county  in  the  State,  as  there  are  no  stagnant  marshes  or  pools 
and  the  streams  are  rapid  and  clear  water.  Extensive  county  ditches  have  been 
built  in  all  parts  of  the  county  so  as  to  drain  all  the  wet  lands  into  the  rivers 
and  streams,  and  farmers  are  using  tile  extensively  on  their  farms.  Clay  is  abun- 
dant,  and   brick   and  tile  are  cheap. 

As  for  transportation,  no  county  in  the  State  is  more  favorably  situated.  The 
Lake  Shore  &amp;  Michigan  Southern,  Michigan  Central,  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette, 
Wabash,  Toledo  &amp;  Ann  Arbor  railroads  traverse  the  county,  with  another  road 
extension  from  Detroit  to  Toledo  being  now  projected.  These,  with  the  lake, 
make  transportation  of  all  kinds  very  easy  and  cheap,  the  railroads  only  charg- 
ing two   cents  per   mile  and  boats,  twenty-five   cents   to  Toledo  from   Monroe. 

For  manufacturing  the  facilities  are  not  surpassed  in  any  portion  of  the  State. 
This  is  one  of  the  oldest  counties  of  the  State  and  had  much  to  do  with  its 
early  history. 

MONTCALM    COUNTY. 
BY   EDWARD   A.    RUNDELL,   EDMORE,    MICH. 

Montcalm  county  was  organized  in  1850.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Isabella 
and  Mecosta,  on  the  east  by  Gratiot,  on  the  south  by  Ionia,  and  on  the  west  by  Kent 
and  Newaygo,  It  has  an  area  of  720  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of 
32,637.     Stanton,  a  town  of  1,352  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  surface  of  the  country  is  generally  rolling.  It  is  watered  by  Flat  river  in  the 
western  part  of  the  county,  and  by  Pine  river  in  the  northeastern  portion,  also  by  a 
number  of  creeks  and  small  lakes  scattered  throughout  the  entire  county.  There  are 
water  powers  on  every  stream  in  the  county.  There  are  a  number  of  swamps  which 
are  all  reclaimable.  The  soil  of  the  northern  and  western  townships  is  of  a  sandy 
loam,  very  productive,  while  that  of  the  eastern  and  southern  townships  is  a  fine 
loam,  very  productive.  The  subsoil  is  clay  throughout.  The  principal  varieties  of 
timber  are  pine,  oak,  beech,  maple  and  ash.  Wheat,  oats,  corn,  potatoes  and  grass 
all  do  well.  Wheat  has  averaged  20  bushels  to  the  acre  for  several  years.  All  sorts 
of  vegetables  are  remarkably  successful.  Fruit  of  all  kinds  is  grown  with  favorable 
results;  peaches,  however,  are  not  a  sure  crop.  Apples  are  shipped  in  large  quan- 
tities to  the  western  market. 

Some  very  large  flour  mills  are  located  in  the  county,  principally  at  Greenville, 
Edmore  and  Howard  City. 

The  soil  of  Montcalm  is  peculiarly  adapted  for  the  production  of  potatoes,  and  the 
county  has  been  justly  noted  for  this  particular  product.  During  the  year  1891, 
602,914  bushels  were  shipped  out  of  the  county,  and  in  the  year  1892  this  amount 
was  largely  increased.  In  1892  the  price  ranged  from  fifty  to  sixty  cents  per  bushel. 
The  acreage  planted  to  potatoes  in  1893  far  exceeds  that  of  any  previous  year.  The 
railroad  companies  have  built  large  potato  store  houses  at  the  principal  points,  viz.: 
Greenville,  Edmore,  Stanton,  Lakeview,  Sheridan,  Howard  City,  Six  Lakes,  and 
McBrides.  These  store  rooms  are  built  to  guard  against  the  most  severe  cold  weather 
and  will  store  several  hundred  thousand  bushels  of  potatoes. 

The  cost  of  clearing  will  average  S15  per  acre,  with  excellent  wood  markets  in  every 
direction,  hardwood,  stove  length,  bringing  from  81.25  to  S1.50  per  cord,  and  soft, 
wood  about  85  cents.  No  government  lands  remain  unsold,  and  but  little  State 
land.  Desirable  unimproved  lands  can  be  had  at  an  average  price  of  $10  per  acre, 
while  the  "  stump  lands "  range  from  $1  to  §5.  These  lands  often  prove  to  be  good 
wheat  lands.  There  is  a  State  road  from  Greenville  to  Big  Rapids,  one  running 
north  from  Ionia  to  Houghton  lake,  and  two  running  east  and  west  through  the 
county.  Snow  falls  by  December  1,  its  average  depth  during  the  season  being 
fifteen  inches,  the  ground  not  freezing  to  any  great  depth.  Plowing  usually  begins 
by  April  20. 

The  schools  and  churches  are  both  numerous  and  excellent.      Agriculture,  lumber-

ing  and  the  manufacture  of  coal,  posts,  ties,  telegraph  poles,  furniture,  refrigerators, 
barrels,  hoops  and  agricultural  implements  are  the  principal  industries.  Labor  is 
always  in  good  demand  at  prices  ranging  from  §20  to  §25  per  month  with  board.  The 
Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern,  its  Big  Rapids  branch,  and  the  Saginaw  Valley  &amp;  St. 
Louis,  the  Grand  Rapids  and  the  Toledo,  Saginaw  &amp;  Muskegon  railroads  cross  the 
county,  affording  excellent  market  facilities  to  every  township,  north,  south,  east  and 
west.  No  better  inducements  can  be  offered  to  the  settler  with  small  means  than 
that  offered  by  this  county.  Land  is  cheap,  the  soil  good,  society,  churches  and 
schools  first  class,  and  the  development  and  permanent  prosperity  of  the  county 
assured. 

MONTMORENCY  COUNTY. 

Montmorency  county  was  organized  in  1881.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by 
Cheboygan  and  Presque  Isle,  on  the  east  by  Alpena,  on  the  south  by  Oscoda,  and 
on  the  west  by  Otsego.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in 
1890  of  1,487.  Hillman  is  the  county  seat.  The  eastern  part  of  the  county  is  very 
level,  the  central  portion  is  rolling,  and  the  western  portion  is  rolling  and  somewhat 
inclined  to  be  hilly.  It  is  watered  by  the  Thunder  bay  river,  which  runs  through 
the  center  of  the  county  from  west  to  east,  and  is  intersected  by  small  streams 
from  the  north  and  south.  There  are  a  number  of  valuable  water  powers.  About 
one-fourth  of  the  county  is  swamp  land,  all  of  which  is  reclaimable;  another  quarter 
of  the  county  consists  principally  of  sand  plains  with  a  good  clay  subsoil  in  some 
places.  The  soil  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  county  is  mainly  a  red  clay ;  that  of  the 
central  portion  varies  from  a  light  sand  to  a  heavy  red  clay,  while  that  of  the  west- 
ern portion  is  a  clay  and  sandy  loam.  The  two  upper  ranges  of  towns  have  a  fair 
soil,  of  which  at  least  two-thirds  is  suitable  for  agriculture ;  this  is  also  true  of  the 
southwestern  townships.  The  region  is  timbered  with  beech  and  maple,  with  hem- 
lock interspersed  and  some  scattering  pine.  One  or  two  townships  contain  large 
tracts  of  "  burnt  land,"  which  have  been  nearly  cleared  by  fire,  and  which  have  an 
excellent  clay  soil  There  are  many  improved  farms  in  town  31,  range  4,  on  which 
reapers  are  now  in  use.  It  is  the  most  thickly  settled  township  in  the  county,  and 
formerly  had  the  county  seat.  The  southern  portion  of  the  county  is  chiefly  composed 
of  yellow  sand  plains.  Spruce  and  Norway  pine  prevail  on  these  plains,  also  white 
pine  along  the  headwaters  of  the  Thunder  bay  river.  With  proper  attention  any 
crop  peculiar  to  the  latitude  can  be  successfully  grown  in  most  portions  of  this  county. 
Vegetables,  roots,  hay,  wheat  and  corn  do  well,  except  in  unusually  cold  seasons. 
Fruit  growing  has  been  tested,  to  a  limited  extent,  with  fair  results.  The  cost  of 
clearing  the  timbered  land  averages  S20  per  acre. 

There  are  37,759  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  The  unimproved  State 
swamp  lands  are  easily  drained,  and  make  valuable  farms.  The  county  also  contains 
large  tracts  of  "stump  lands,"  with  fair  soil,  which  can  be  bought  at  prices  ranging 
from  $1 50  to  $3  per  acre.  The  Agricultural  college  and  school  lands  are  well 
adapted  to  farming  purposes.  A  State  road  runs  east  and  west  through  the  county, 
connecting  Hillman  with  the  village  of  Atlanta.  The  local  highways  are  as  yet  very 
new  and  are  in  great  need  of  improvement. 

Snow  falls  by  the  middle  of  November  to  an  average  depth  of  ten  inches,  the 
ground  not  freezing  to  any  depth.  Plowing  begins  by  May  1,  or  as  soon  as  the 
snow  melts. 

The  public  schools  are  few,  but  every  effort  is  made  to  have  the  standard  as  iiigh 
as  that  of  the  adjoining  counties,  where  schools  are  more  plentiful. 

There  are  about  sixty  million  feet  of  pine  cut  annually  in  this  county.  Large 
quantities  of  posts,  ties  and  poles  are  gotten  out,  which  employs  all  of  the  labor  that 
is  available,  at  wages  ranging  from  826  to  830  per  month  with  board.  The  taxes 
average  about  So  per  40  acres,  and  are  chiefly  local. 

MUSKEGON    COUNTY. 

Muskegon  county  was  an  offspring  from  Ottawa,  1859.  It  is  located  on  Lake 
Michigan,  between  Ottawa  and  Oceana  counties.  In  1890  it  had  a  population  of 
40,013,  composed  of  a  good  class  of  people,  largely  from  New  York  and  Ohio.  A 
great  many  Swedes  and  Hollanders,  most  of  whom  are  honest,  sober,  industrious  and 
reliable,  settled    here;    also  many    Germans  and  good   people  of    other    nationalities. 


264  Michigan  and  its  Resources. 

Some  of  the  best  and  leading  citizens  are  Americans  by  adoption,  and  love  their 
adopted  country.    ' 

The  county  covers  an  area  of  321,403  acres  of  various  kinds  of  land,  a  large  portion 
of  which  is  sandy,  but  when  properly  tilled  produces  great  results.  Sandy  soil  is 
not  so  good  for  cereal  crops  and  hay  as  clay  land,  but  for  fruit  and  vegetables  it  is 
more  reliable  than  clay.  Potatoes  produced  on  this  soil,  while  not  so  large,  are 
superior  in  quality.  Rarely  is  a  diseased  potato  found  in  sandy  soil.  The  largest 
cabbage  we  have  any  knowledge  of  was  raised  near  Muskegon  city,  weighing  over  67 
pounds  net. 

The  sandy  soil  of  West  Michigan  requires  fertilizing,  but  to  fertilize  and  properly 
cultivate  is  like  putting  money  in  a  bank  (in  fact  it  can  be  recovered  sooner  than 
from  some  banks). 

Potatoes,  sweet  corn,  melons,  strawberries,  and  all  other  kinds  of  berries,  cabbage, 
celery,  and  flowers,  all  such  things,  grow  to  perfection. 

This  county  was  formally  a  dense  forest  of  pine,  hemlock,  birch,  maple,  ash,  elm, 
etc.  The  pine  and  hemlock  were  cut,  leaving  large  amounts  of  the  other  kinds. 
The  beech  and  maple  is  held  for  fuel,  and  the  supply  is  nearly  inexhaustible. 

The  prevailing  winds  are  from  the  west,  and  come  pure  off  Lake  Michigan,  making 
it  a  remarkably  healthy  locality.  Hay  fever  patients  who  have  suffered  for  twenty- 
tive  years,  have  spent  summers  in  Muskegon  county,  on  the  margin  of  the  lake, 
without  a  symptom  of  the  disease.  At  an  early  day  there  was  some  ague,  but 
since  the  country  was  opened  up  and  drained,  as  is  the  case  generally  over  the  State, 
it  disappeared. 

The  county  is  well  watered  by  numerous  streams  and  lakes,  which  are  plentifully 
stocked  with  fish.  There  are  some  bear,  deer  and  other  game,  while  ducks  and 
feathered  game  are  plenty. 

Muskegon,  the  county  seat,  is  located  on  Muskegon  lake,  an  arm  of  Lake  Michi- 
gan, five  miles  long  and  over  one  mile  wide,  covering  about  5,000  acres,  with  a  harbor 
capable  of  sheltering  from  storm  all  the  vessels  on  the  great  lakes  at  one  time.  The 
population  of  the  city  is  about  27,000.  Until  recently,  it  was  said  to  be  the  greatest 
lumber  producing  city  in  the  world.  Within  the  last  four  or  five  years,  this  industry 
has  dropped  off  to  some  extent,  and  the  manufacturing  is  taking  a  more  solid  form. 
No  city  can  be  permanently  prosperous  upon  a  lumber  producing  basis  only;  mills 
are  built,  makeshifts  of  houses  thrown  together,  the  land  skimmed  of  its  wealth,  then 
mills  and  men  flit  away  leaving  nothing  but  stump  land,  worthless  shanties,  and 
high  equalization  of  value  to  pay  taxes  on.  An  exclusive  saw  mill  industry  is  no 
benefit  to  any  county.  The  aim  of  the  Muskegon  people  has  been  to  place  manu- 
facturing on  a  solid  basis,  and  success  is  crowning  their  efforts.  Shipping  accom- 
modations at  Muskegon  will  attract  manufacturing.  While  rates  are  exceedingly 
low.  the  time  between  Muskegon  and  Chicago  and  Milwaukee  is,  in  a  business  point 
of  view,  exactly  nothing.  Shipments  at  the  close  of  business  from  Muskegon  reach 
Chicago  the  next  morning  before  business  begins,  and  so  with  travel.  Business  men 
can  take  a  day  in  Chicago  and  be  away  from  business  at  home  only  a  day,  leaving 
Muskegon  in  the  evening  and  arriving  at  Chicago  the  next  morning  at  about  six 
o'clock,  leaving  Chicago  at  night  and  arriving  home  in  early  morning,  all  at  a  small 
cost. 

The  city  is  abreast  with  the  times  in  modern  conveniences.  Water  is  pumped 
from  Lake  Michigan,  and  the  supply  is  not  liable  to  be  exhausted.  Electric  lights 
and  cars,  churches,  schools,  hotels,  railroads,  a  new  court  house,  one  of  the  best  in 
the  State,  about  completed,  all  first  class.  Muskegon  has  many  public  spirited  citi- 
zens, who  do  not  stand  on  the  order  of  their  going,  but  go  promptly;  business  is 
their  watchword,  fair  dealing  their  motto,  enterprise  the  spirit,  success  the  aim.  and 
to  "  get  there  "  the  incentive.  Knowing  the  transient  chai'acter  of  the  saw  mill  busi- 
ness, they  aim  to  solidify  manufacturing  to  permanent  works  with  skilled  labor  and 
a  permanent  citizenship,  with  permanent  homes  and  interests.  If  enterprise  with 
opportunity  will  succeed  (and  it  generally  does)  Muskegon  will  get  to  the  king  row. 

There  are  several  thriving  villages,  among  which  are  Whitehall,  Montague,  Ravenna. 
Fruitport.  Sullivan,  etc.  A  five  cents  outlay  and  fifteen  minutes  time  will  carry 
citizens  to  Lake  Michigan  Park,  where  the  pure  air  and  water  of  Lake  Michigan  can 
be  enjoyed  to  a  full  extent;  but  that  is  not  all,  25  cents  will  pay  the  round  trip  to 
Hackley  Assembly  ground,  •"  the  gem  of  the  Chautauquas."  In  short,  there  are 
resorts  in  all  directions,  very  fine  but  cheap.  Visitors  generally  report  Muskegon  a 
good  place  to  summer,  and  after  one  visit  almost  invariably  return  the  next  season.

NEWAYGO    COUNTY. 

BY   THAD   WATEES,    FREEMONT,    MICH. 

Newaygo  county  was  organized  in  1851.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Lake, 
on  the  east  by  Mecosta  and  Montcalm,  on  the  south  by  Muskegon  and  Kent, 
and  on  the  west  by  Muskegon  and  Oceana.  The  name  is  an  Indian  one  and 
means  "Here  we  rest."  There  are  a  number  of  thriving  villages  in  the  county, 
the  principal  of  which  are  Newaygo,  the  county  seat,  Freemont,  Hesperia,  White 
Cloud  and  Grant.  The  village  of  Newaygo  has,  without  exception  the  best  water 
power  in  the  lower  peninsula.  It  is  a  manufacturing  town.  Freemont  is  situ- 
ated in  a  very  fertile  farming  country,  and  is  also  extensively  engaged  in  manufact- 
ures. Vast  forests  of  pine  timber  a  few  years  ago  covered  this  county,  but  the 
pine  is  now  harvested  and  the  lands  are  being  rapidly  improved.  There  are 
1,779  acres  of  government  and  State  land  for  sale  or  entry  in  this  county.  All 
pine  stump  lands  underlaid  with  a  clay  subsoil  are  the  best  wheat  and  orchard 
lands  in  the  State.  Grant,  Garfield,  Sherman,  Lincoln  and  Denver  have  large 
bodies  of  such  land.  The  township  of  Goodwell  is  nearly  all  such  land.  They 
can  be  bought  at  from  $3  to  do  per  acre,  and  the  stumps  pulled  and  put  into 
fences  at  from  75  cents  to  81  per  rod.  When  once  cleared  these  lands  are  far 
superior  to  prairie  lands  for  wheat,  apples  and  peaches.  Apples  and  peaches 
are  destined  to  be  the  crop  of  this  county  in  the  near  future.  Thousands  of 
peach  trees  have  been  set  in  the  last  year  and  are  beginning  to  yield  a  boun- 
tiful harvest.  The  economical  way  of  setting  fruit,  apples  every  four  rods  and 
peaches  one  rod  apart  between  has  not  been  practiced  much  as  yet.  The  peach  is 
a  short  lived  tree  and  set  with  apples  in  the  manner  indicated,  leaves  when  old 
and  worthless,  an  apple  orchard  just  coming  fully  into  fruiting.  Those  who  rush 
by  the  State  of  Michigan  for  big  red  apples  do  not  know  what  they  are  doing. 
Over  15,000  bushels  were  shipped  from  Freemont  alone  in  the  fall  of  1892.  Two 
railroads  traverse  the  county  north  and  south  and  one  east  and  west.  The 
county  is  well  watered  with  innumerable  spring  brooks,  all  stocked  with  speckled 
trout,  which  flow  into  the  Muskegon,  White  and  Pere  Marquette  rivers. 
The  water  in  these  streams  is  as  clear,  cold  and  pure  as  heaven  can  make  it, 
and  no  miasmatic  taint  sends  the  stranger  who  pitches  his  tabernacle  on  their 
shady  banks  to  the  drug  store  for  quinine  to  relieve  his  shakes.  Thousands  of 
acres  of  blackberries  furnieh  us  with  this  luscious  fruit,  to  be  had  only  for  the 
picking.  Thousands  of  bushels  are  picked  every  year  and  yet  probably  not  one- 
half  are  saved.  No  better  schools  can  be  found  in  Michigan  than  those  found 
in  Newaygo  county,  and  the  school  system  of  Michigan  is  equal  to  any  in  the 
world.  The  patriotism,  hospitality  and  push-aheadativeness  of  the  people  of  this 
county  are  not  excelled,  and  we  say  to  all  who  wish  to  make  a  comfortable 
home   and  become   active  business  citizens:   "Newaygo" — here  we  rest! 


OAKLAND    COUNTY. 

Oakland  county  was  organized  in  1820.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Genesee 
and  Lapeer,  on  the  east  by  Macomb,  on  the  south  by  Washtenaw  and  Wayne,  and 
on  the  west  by  Livingston  and  Genesee.  It  has  an  area  of  900  square  miles,  and 
had  a  population  in  1890  of  41,245.  Pontiac,  a  town  of  6,200  inhabitants,  is  the  county 
seat.  Near  this  town  is  located  the  Eastern  Asylum  for  the  Insane,  a  magnificent 
structure,  which  accommodates  a  large  number  of  patients.  At  Orchard  Lake,  near 
Pontiac,  is  also  a  fine  military  school,  which  enjoys  a  large  patronage.  The  surface 
of  the  county  is  generally  rolling,  though  not  hilly.  The  highest  land  of  that  section 
of  country  lying  between  Lake  Michigan,  Lake  St.  Clair,  Saginaw  Bay  and  Detroit 
river  is  found  in  this  county,  it  being  from  400  to  600  feet  above  the  Detroit  river. 
Four  important  rivers  rise  near  the  center  of  the  county,  flowing  in  entirely  different 
directions,  viz.:  the  Shiawassee,  the  Huron,  the  Clinton,  and  the  Rouge.  The  county 
is  well  watered  also  by  numerous  smaller  streams  and  inland  lakes,  there  being  no 
less  than  100  of  these  small  lakes  within  the  border  of  the  county.  There  is  some 
swampy  land  along  the  border  of  the  lakes,  nearly  all  of  which  is  reclaimable.  A 
number  of  available  waters  are  found  along  the  larger  streams,  many  of  which  are 
in  use.

The  Boil  is  a  mixture  of  sand,  clay  and  loam ;  this  combination  prevailing  in  every 
township  in  the  county.  The  subsoil  is  uniformly  clay.  The  eastern  portion  of  the 
county  was  originally  timbered  with  beech,  maple,  basswood,  oak,  ash,  elm,  etc.,  while 
the  northern  portion  was  timbered  chiefly  with  oak.  But  little  timber  now  remains, 
and  this  is  carefully  husbanded  for  domestic  use. 

Wheat  is  the  staple,  though  large  crops  of  corn,  oats,  barley,  rye,  buckwheat, 
potatoes,  and  all  garden  vegetables  are  annually  harvested.  Apples,  pears,  peaches 
and  grapes  are  profitably  cultivated.  The  Canada  Red,  Baldwin  and  Greening  apples, 
the  Bartlett  pear,  the  Crawford  peaches  (early  and  late  varieties),  and  the  Concord 
grapes  have  a  large  sale  in  Detroit,  Toledo  and  Chicago  markets.  As  stated  above, 
timbered  lands  are  scarce,  hence,  hardwood  brings  from  $3  to  $4  per  cord,  and  soft 
wood  about  a  dollar  less.  There  are  no  government,  State  or  railroad  lands  for  sale  in 
this  county.  Improved  farms  are  the  only  available  lands,  at  prices  ranging  from  $50 
to  $100  per  acre.  The  highways  of  the  county  are  unexceptionally  good.  The  two 
great  wagon  roads,  viz.:  the  Saginaw  turnpike,  and  the  Grand  River  turnpike  (both 
leading  to  Detroit),  are  extensively  traveled. 

About  seven  months  constitute  an  ordinary  sieason  for  productive  farm  labor. 
Little  snow  falls  prior  to  January  1.  It  generally  averages  from  6  to  12  inches  in 
depth.  The  ground  usually  freezes  to  a  moderate  depth,  depending  entirely  on  the 
fall  of  snow.  A  gravelly  open  soil  in  an  exposed  situation  will  sometimes  freeze  to  a 
depth  of  three  feet.     Spring  work  begins  usually  by  April  1st. 

The  schools  are  very  numerous  and  sustain  a  fine  reputation.  Agriculture  is  the 
principal  industry,  and  creates  a  constant  demand  for  farm  labor  during  the  summer 
season,  wages  usually  ranging  from  $15  to  $24  per  month  with  board.  A  large  peat 
bed  was  discovered  a  few  years  since,  not  far  from  Highland,  on  the  line  of  the  Flint  &amp; 
Pere  Marquette  railroad,  which  yields  a  considerable  amount  of  this  peculiar  fuel. 
The  Detroit,  Grand  Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee,  the  Detroit  &amp;  Bay  City,  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere 
Marquette  and  a  branch  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railroad  place  every  section  of  land 
throughout  the  county  within  easy  reach  of  market  facilities. 


OCEANA  COUNTY. 
BY    FRED    J.    RUSSELL,    HART,    MICH. 

Oceana  county  was  organized  in  1855.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Mason  county, 
on  the  east  by  Newaygo,  on  the  south  by  Muskegon  and  on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan. 

It  has  an  area  of  540  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  15,698.  The  prin- 
cipal villages  are  Hart,  Shelby  and  Pentwater.  Hart  the  county  seat  has  a  population 
of  1,200,  and  is  a  thrifty,  enterprising  village,  with  excellent  schools,  churches,  two 
banks  and  first  class  hotel  accommodations. 

The  extreme  eastern  portion  of  the  county  is  comparatively  level  for  several  miles 
near  the  lake  shore,  the  land  is  gently  undulating,  while  the  eastern  portion  is  still 
more  rolling,  and  some  parts  to  a  person  accustomed  to  a  flat  country  might  be  called 
hilly. 

The  entire  county  is  beautifully  watered  by  springs  and  spring  brooks  the  finest  in 
the  world,  joining  each  other  on  their  way  to  Lake  Michigan,  and  forming  the  north 
and  south  branches  of  the  Pentwater  river  in  the  northern  portion,  and  the  north  and 
south  branches  of  the  White  river  in  the  southern  portion,  together  with  many  island 
lakes  and  other  small  streams  wending  their  way  to  the  great  lake  single  handed  and 
alone.  Good  well  water  is  abundant,  and  the  streams  abound  in  speckled  trout,  and 
the  lakes  are  well  stocked  with  fish.  The  soil  is  a  sandy  loam,  with  a  large  amount  of 
lime  gravel,  with  a  black  vegetable  mold,  with  clay  subsoil  in  the  central  and  eastern 
portion,  running  to  lighter  soil  in  the  western. 

The  timber  is  principally  sugar  maple,  elm,  basswood  and  beech,  unsurpassed  for 
size  and  beauty. 

Every  crop  that  is  peculiar  to  Michigan  is  grown  successfully  in  this  county,  and 
especially  is  this  true  of  fruits  and  vegetables.  The  potatoes  of  Oceana  county  are  the 
standard  of  excellence,  and  are  surpassed  by  none.  They  have  a  national  reputation  in 
potato  markets;  that  crop  responds  to  the  labor  of  the  farmer  so  that  he  is  often  sur- 
prised at  his  success,  250  to  300  buehels  per  acre  is  not  an  uncommon  yield,  with  an 
occasional  crop  of  400  to  500  bushels  per  acre.  Wheat,  corn,  oats,  timothy  and  clover 
are  raised  with  success. 

Apples,  pears  and  cherries  and  small  fruits  are  grown  to  great  perfection  throughout 


Michigan  by  Counties.  267 

the  entire  county.  Oceana  county  seems  to  be  the  home  of  the  plum,  the  perfection  in 
which  it  is  grown  in  this  county  is  not  surpassed  in  any  county,  either  in  or  out  of 
Michigan,  and  it  is  not  uncommon  for  the  plum  growers  in  this  county  to  receive  a  net 
income  from  their  plums  of  S200  to  S350  per  acre  annually  for  a  series  of  years.  The 
peculiar  location  of  this  county  extending  westerly  into  Lake  Michigan,  so  that  that 
great  body  of  open  water  tempers  and  warms  the  northwest,  west  and  southwest  winds 
thereby  extracting  the  stmg  which  the  great  northwest  is  so  apt  to  furnish,  rendering 
the  winter  weather  mild  and  peculiarly  fitting  for  a  fruit  county,  and  especially  is  this 
necessary  to  raise  the  peach  successfully.  Peach  trees  have  not  heretofore  been  killed 
in  this  county  by  freezing,  the  rolling  lands  furnish  an  ideal  location  for  this  beautiful 
fruit.  None  of  the  diseases  peculiar  to  the  peach,  and  which  have  so  devastated  the  older 
peach  belts  in  this  and  other  states  have  been  discovered  here.  The  crops  of  peaches  in 
this  county  have  been  annual  for  a  louig  series  of  years,  and  the  trees  that  are  in  full 
bearing,  and  are  being  planted  are  numbered  by  hundreds  of  thousands  until  the  hills 
and  high  table  lands  are  being  set  to  peaches,  and  the  lower  lands  to  plums.  The 
growing  of  peaches  is  claimed  to  be  still  more  profitable  than  that  of  plums,  and  a 
ready  market  is  furnished  in  Chicago,  Milwaukee,  and  the  great  west  and  northwest 
for  all  fruits  grown  here.  In  the  great  markets  these  fruits  are  advertised  as  Oceana 
county  fruits.  Good  fruit  land  can  be  furnished  uncultivated  for  $10  to  820  per  acre. 
With  a  good  demand  for  the  timber  products,  the  value  of  fruit  farms  with  bearing 
orchard  depends  entirely  upon  the  quantity  and  age  of  trees.  There  is  much  unim- 
proved land  in  this  county  which  can  be  purchased  at  reasonable  prices,  that  is  well 
adapted  for  either  general  farming  or  fruit  growing,  or  both.  Large  quantities  of 
maple  ugar  and  syrup  are  made  annually. 

The  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan  Railway  extends  from  the  south  through  the  county, 
terminating  at  Hart  and  Pentwater.  The  Mason  &amp;  Oceana  Railroad  from  Ludington 
enters  the  northeast  part  of  the  county,  terminating  at  Walkerville.  The  highways  are 
in  very  good  condition  for  a  new  county,  and  they  are  especially  free  from  mud,  com- 
pared to  those  in  most  timbered  lands. 

The  winters  are  milder  than  in  other  parts  of  the  State,  away  from  the  lake  shore,  for 
the  reasons  given.  There  are  1,320  acres  of  government  and  State  land  subject  to  sale 
or  entry  in  this  county. 

There  is  usually  sufficient  snow  for  good  sleighing,  the  ground  rarely  freezing,  and 
active  work  on  the  farm  commences  about  the  first  of  April. 

The  schools  and  churches  are  good  and  well  attended.  The  principal  industries  are 
agriculture,  fruit  raising  and  lumbering  of  hardwood.  There  are  manufactories  for 
working  hardwood  at  Hart,  Pentwater  and  Shelby.  Pentwater  has  a  good  harbor,  and 
is  a  well  known  lake  port  and  enjoys  a  large  shipping  trade. 

The  health  of  the  entire  county  is  good  and  the  residents  are  possessed  of  thrift  and 
■enterprise  rarely  found,  being  settled  with  people  from  New  York  and  Ohio  largely. 


OGEMAW  COUNTY. 

Ogemaw  county  was  organized  in  1875.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Oscoda,  on 
ihe  east  by  Iosco,  on  the  south  by  Gladwin  and  Arenac,  and  on  the  west  by  Ros- 
common. It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  in  1890  had  a  population  of  5,583. 
West  Branch,  a  town  of  1,700  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  undulating,  and  is  well  watered  by  the  Rifle  river  and 
its  many  branches ;  also  by  numerous  springs  and  spring  brooks.  There  are  occasional 
swamps   with   cedar,  tamarack,  black   ash,   white   maple,   and  other  similar  timber. 

These  swamps  are  generally  reclaimable,  and  it  is  believed  will  make  good  meadow 
lands.  The  southwestern  part  of  the  county  contains  a  large  tract  of  hardwood 
(beech  and  maple  with  hemlock  and  pine  interspersed)  growing  in  a  good  clay  soil. 
North  of  this  lies  a  ridge  of  white  and  Norway  pine.  The  rest  of  the  county  to  its 
eastern  border  is  occupied  by  a  series  of  ridges  and  valleys  having  a  north  and  South 
tendency,  and  located  in  the  following  order,  commencing  in  the  west:  1st.  the  plains 
of  yellow  sand;  2d,  ridges  and  valleys  with  much  Norway  and  white  pine,  and  consid- 
erable gravelly  soil  of  fine  quality;  3d,  a  hardwood  ridge  with  a  good  clay  soil;  4th,  in 
the  extreme  eastern  part  of  the  county  commence  what  are  known  as  the  Tawas  plains, 
which  extend  far  into  Iosco.  These  plains  have  a  soil  of  yellow  sand.  The  prevailing 
timber  is  jack  or  spruce  pine,  which  makes  a  good  fuel,  and  can  be  used  for  fencing. 
They  have  been  burned  over  often,  the  fires  burning  down  into  the  land  itself,  the 
soil  apparently  rendered  combustible  by  the  drippings  of  pitch  from  the  pines.  They 
are  without  a  regular  subsoil,  but  still  retain  moisture.    Lakes  are  scattered  through 


268  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

the  plains,  and  surface  springs  are  also  found.  There  are  many  homesteaders  farming 
on  these  plains,  who  raise  good  crops  of  clover  and  rye,  excellent  vegetables,  also 
corn  and  wheat  in  favorable  seasons.  Fertilizers  are  used  to  a  considerable  extent, 
and  what  this  soil  will  do  under  continued  cultivation  is  yet  to  be  tested.  There 
is  considerable  maple  timber  in  the  county,  the  soft  maple  growing  in  the  sand,  while 
in  the  clay  lands  the  hard  sugar  maple  flourishes  and  predominates  over  the  beech. 
On  the  clay  lands  vegetables  and  rye  are  good  crops,  as  are  hay  and  clover.  Corn  and 
wheat  also  do  well  in  favorable  seasons.  The  capacity  of  the  county  for  fruits  has 
not  yet  been  thoroughly  tested,  and  the  later  frosts  are  now  considered  a  serious 
obstacle  to  successful  fruit  raising.     Berries,  however,  grow  in  abundance. 

The  cost  of  clearing  averages  $20  per  acre  on  the  heavy  timbered  lands  and  from  SI 
to  $5  on  the  plains.  There  are,  as  yet,  no  wood  markets  of  any  consequence.  There 
are  5,214  acres  subject  to  sale  or  entry,  also  some  railroad  lands  There  are 
plenty  of  unimproved  lands  within  a  few  miles  of  the  county  seat  which  can  be 
had  at  prices  ranging  from  S2.50  to  SIO  per  acre.  These  lands  have  a  soil  of  clay  loam, 
and  make  the  best  of  farms.  When  located  in  remote  parts  of  the  county  the 
price  varies  from  $3  to  $6  per  acre.  There  are  large  tracts  of  stump  land  which  are 
rapidly  coming  into  the  market.  The  Manistee  and  Tawas  State  road  runs  east  and 
west  through  the  county.  There  is  also  a  State  road  running  north  and  south  which 
passes  about  a  mile  east  of  the  county  seat.  Snow  falls  early  in  November  to  an 
average  depth  of  20  inches.     Spring  work  begins  early  in  April. 

There  are  about  thirty  schools  in  the  county,  all  of  which  have  more  than  six 
months'  school  each  year.  Lumbering  is  as  yet  the  principal  industry.  Ties,  posts 
and  telegraph  poles  are  gotton  out  in  large  quantities.  Labor  is  in  good  demand, 
wages  ranging  from  $1  to  $1.50  per  day.  In  the  lumber  woods  wages  range  from 
$20  to  $30  per  month  with,  board.  The  Mackinac  division  of  the  Michigan  Central 
and  the  Tawas  &amp;  Bay  County  railroads  are  the  only  ones  traversing  the  county  at 
present.  The  Michigan  Central  Railroad  company  has  surveyed  a  line  25  miles  in 
length,  extending  in  a  northeasterly  direction  from  Beaver  lake.  This  line  will, 
eventually,  reach  Alpena.  There  is  also  a  projected  extension  of  the  Toledo,  Ann 
Arbor  &amp;  Northern  from  North  Bradley,  on  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  railroad,  to 
Alpena,  which  will  cross  the  county. 


ONTONAGON  COUNTY. 

Ontonagon  county  is  situated  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  upper  peninsula, 
and  borders  on  Lake  Superior.  In  area  it  is  one  of  the  largest  counties  in  the 
State,  containing  over  thirty-seven  surveyed  townships  of  land.  The  principal 
industries  of  the  county  are  lumbering  in  the  interior  and  fishing  on  the  coast. 
Formerly  copper  mining  was  extensively  carried  on,  but  at  the  present  prices  of  copper 
none  of  the  mines  can  be  worked  at  a  profit  except  by  tributers.  The  Minnesota 
and  National  copper  mines  are  located  at  Rockland  this  county.  These  mines  were 
formerly  noted  for  their  large  masses  or  native  copper  found  in  their  depths.  One 
such  mass  taken  from  the  former  mine  weighed  over  five  hundred  tons  and  is  the 
largest  single  mass  of  copper  ever  discovered.  It  took  nearly  two  years  to  cut  this 
huge  boulder  of  copper  and  hoist  it  to  the  surface.  At  the  present  price  of  copper 
mass  mining  is  no  longer  profitable  and  the  scene  of  great  copper  mining  has 
been  transferred  to  Houghton  county,  where  the  stamp  veins  being  more  uniform 
in  their  formation  can  be  mined  at  a  profit. 

A  large  portion  of  the  county  is  covered  with  pine  and  hardwood  forests,  and 
lumbering  may  be  said  to  be  the  chief  industry.  The  soil  along  the  line  of  the 
Mineral  Range  mountains  which  traverse  the  county  from  northeast  to  southwest 
is  very  rich  and  productive.  Many  of  the  miners  along  the  range  have  lately  turned 
their  attention  to  farming.  Oats,  barley,  potatoes,  and  all  kinds  of  garden  veget- 
ables are  grown  in  great  abundance,  the  yield  of  oats  to  the  acre  often  exceeding 
sixty  bushels.     Apples,  plums,  and  small  berries  are  also  raised  with  profit. 

For  many  years,  during  the  summer  season,  fishing  for  whitefish  and  Lake  Super- 
ior trout  has  been  extensively  carried  on  at  Ontonagon,  the  county  seat.  The 
latter  place  has  an  elegant  brick  court  house  and  jail,  good  school  houses,  several 
stores,  and  a  population  of  about  1,800.  It  is  situated  on  Lake  Superior  at  the 
mouth  of  the  Ontonagon  river.  The  Methodist,  Catholic,  Presbyterian  and  Episco- 
pal are  the  leading  churches,  each  one  owning  a  church  edifice  of  fair  propor- 
tions, and  having  a  fair  sized  congregation.    The  Milwaukee  &amp;  Northern  Railroad 


Michigan  by   Counties.  269 

connects  Ontonagon  by  a  direct  line  with  Milwaukee  and  Chicago,  and  the 
mouth  of  the  Ontonagon  river  furnishes  a  good  harbor  for  all  vessels  navigating  the 
great  lakes 

The  residents  of  Ontonagon.  Rockland  and  Greenland,  known  as  the  old  part  of 
the  county,  are  noted  for  their  hospitality  and  genial  old  fashioned  social  ways. 

The  greater  portion  of  the  county,  especially  in  the  southern  part,  is  covered 
with  vast  forests  of  pine  and  hard  maple.  Lumbering  is  extensively  carried  on  in 
the  pineries.  The  Diamond  Match  Co.  operates  two  large  saw  mills  at  Ontonagon. 
Several  other  smaller  mills  are  located  at  Ewen,  on  the  Duluth,  South  Shore  &amp; 
Atlantic  Railroad  in  the  southern  part,  which  is  the  second  place  in  population 
and  enterprise  in  the  county.  It  is  situated  in  the  heart  of  the  pineries,  and  although 
but  four  years  old  is  already  known  as  a  hustling  town.  It  has  water  works,  a  fire 
department,  good  hotels  and  churches,  and  what  is  of  more  importance,  a  progressive 
people.  A  prosperous  future  is  assured  for  Ewen  as  well  as  for  the  adjacent  lum- 
bering towns  of  Trout  Creek,  Interior  and  Matchwood. 

Improved  hardwood  lands  are  worth  SIO  an  acre.  Pine  lands  are  worth  from  $3 
to  S7  per  thousand  feet  stumpage,  depending  on  the  quality.  The  county  will  be 
made  conspicuous  at  the  World's  Columbian  Exposition  for  its  huge  exhibit  load 
of  pine  logs,  containing  36,055  feet  of  timber,  in  fifty-five  logs,  loaded  and  hauled 
by  the  Nester  estate  at  Ewen,  Ontonagon  county,  in  February,  1893. 

Ontonagon  county  is  a  good  place  for  settlers  looking  for  cheap  homes.  Several 
thousand  acres  of  good  hardwood  land  adjacent  to  railroads  are  yet  subject  to 
homestead  entry,  but  are  fast  being  taken  up  by  enterprising  settlers  who  are  rap- 
idly turning  the  wilderness  into  beautiful  farms.  Wood  brings  from  S3  to  $4  per 
cord  in  the  towns  and  more  than  pays  for  the  clearing  of  the  land. 


OSCEOLA    COUNTY. 
BY    C.    E.    DERMONT,   EVART,   MICH. 

Osceola  county  was  organized  in  1869;  is  located  in  the  northwestern  half  of  the 
lower  peninsula;  a  line  drawn  north  and  south  equi  distant  from  Saginaw  bay  on  the 
east  and  Lake  Michigan  on  the  west  forms  its  eastern  boundary  line. 

It  is  seventy-six  miles  west  from  Saginaw,  and  sixty-nine  miles  north  of  Grand 
Rapids;  is  in  the  same  latitude  as  Portland,  Maine,  and  not  so  far  north  as  Ogdensburg, 
New  York. 

It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles,  and  a  population,  in  1890,  of  14,630. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  greatly  diversified,  the  larger  portion  of  the  county, 
however,  being  comparatively  level.  The  northwestern  portion  is  quite  hilly.  An 
extensive  belt  of  pine  barrens  is  found  on  the  line  of  the  Flint  and  Pere  Marquette 
Railroad,  east  and  west  of  Evart,  with  a  generally  level  surface.  Back  of  this  the  land 
is  more  desirable,  beech  and  maple  lands  predominating,  with  occasional  white  cedar 
swamps,  which  make  fine  grass  lands  when  reclaimed.  The  county  is  well  watered  by 
the  Muskegon  river  and  its  tributaries;  also  by  a  large  number  of  spring  brooks.  A 
sandy  loam  predominates,  but  all  kinds  of  soil,  varying  from  a  light  sand  to  a  heavy 
clay,  are  found  in  nearly  every  township.  The  subsoil  is  generally  clay.  The  principal 
varieties  of  timber  are  maple,  rock-elm,  black  and  white  ash,  beech,  and  basswood. 
There  are,  however,  belts  of  pine,  hemlock,  and  some  birch  in  most  townships.  All 
nothern  crops  grow  to  perfection.  That  the  soil  of  Osceola  county  is  well  adapted  to 
growng  wheat  is  made  evident  by  the  fact  that  wheat  has  been  known  to  yield  forty 
bushels  to  the  acre,  although  the  average  yield  is  much  less.  Corn,  buckwheat,  potatoes, 
peas,  etc.,  do  well.  Apples  are  a  successful  crop.  Plums,  pears,  cherries,  and  berries, 
particularly  whortleberries,  yield  abundantly.  Peaches,  however,  are  not  to  be 
depended  on. 

Only  576  acres  of  public  lands  remain  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  Plenty  of  good  unim- 
proved lands  can  be  had  at  prices  ranging  from  §4  to  $10  per  acre.  The  stump  lands 
are  also  plentiful,  and  are  to  be  had  at  from  §3.50  to  $10.00  per  acre,  The  highways  are 
constructed  on  section  lines,  and  are  as  good  as  the  average  highways  throughout  the 
State.  The  seasons  are  possibly  a  fortnight  later  than  in  the  counties  further  south. 
Snow  falls  to  a  considerable  depth,  the  ground  seldom  freezing. 

The  schools  are  plentiful  and  good,  there  being  sixty-eight  school  districts  in  the 
county.  Lumbering,  the  cutting  of  ties,  posts,  and  poles,  river  driving,  tan-bark  peel- 
ing, the  manufacture  of  shingles,  and  agriculture,  are  the  principal  industries.     The

Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette,  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana,  and  its  Luther  branch,  and 
Toledo,  Ann  Arbor  and  North  Michigan,  traversing  the  county  on  all  sides,  east,  west, 
north  and  south,  affording  good  and  convenient  facilities  to  both  settlers  and  shippers. 

Among  the  principal  towns  and  villages  is  Reed  City,  in  the  southwestern  part  of  the 
county,  at  the  junction  of  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  and  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana 
railroads.  It  is  an  incorporated  village,  having  a  population  of  1,776.  Contains  a 
number  of  manufacturing  industries,  a  National  bank,  many  fine  stores,  churches,  and 
an  opera  house,  and  is  surrounded  by  a  fine  farming  community. 

Evart,  the  second  village  in  size  and  importance,  is  also  incorporated  and  is  located 
in  the  southern  central  part  of  the  county,  fourteen  miles  east  of  Reed  City,  on  the 
Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  Railroad,  where  this  road  crosses  the  Muskegon  river.  It  is  a 
very  thriving  village  with  a  population  of  1,270  in  1890.  It  contains  two  saw  mills, 
planing  mill,  shook  factory,  stave  and  heading  mill,  flour  mill,  a  good  bank,  churches, 
many  tine  stores,  and  the  tinest  plant  for  supplying  the  village  with  spring  water  in  the 
State;  mains  are  laid  in  all  the  principal  streets,  affording  most  excellent  fire  protec- 
tion. The  water  works  plant  was  erected  by  the  village,  at  a  cost  of  $10,000,  and  is  paid 
for.  Evart  is  also  the  home  of  the  Champion  Tool  and  Handle  Works,  the  largest 
manufacturers  of  all  kinds  of  tools  used  in  lumbering  operations  in  the  United  States. 
Their  goods  are  sold  all  over  this  country,  and  large  bills  are  exported.  It  is  also  the 
rendezvous  for  trout  fishers,  there  being  no  less  than  seven  spring  creeks  in  this  vicin- 
ity, that  are  noted  for  the  number  and  size  of  the  trout;  many  thousands  are  taken 
from  the  waters  of  these  streams  every  season,  affording  both  sport  and  recreation  to 
the  many  who  annually  make  a  pilgrimage  to  this  lovely  little  town.  Graduates  from 
its  public  schools  are  eligible  for  admission  to  the  State  University  and  the  State 
Normal  School. 

Marion,  located  in  Marion  township,  in  the  northeastern  corner  of  the  county,  is  a 
lively  town  of  recent  growth,  on  the  Toledo,  Ann  Arbor  &amp;  North  Michigan  Railroad.  It 
has  a  splendid  flour  mill,  run  by  water  power,  and  a  couple  of  saw  mills,  also  does  a 
good  business  in  tan-bark,  ties,  cedar  posts  and  shingles.  It  is  a  growing  place,  with  a 
population  of  about  six  hundred. 

Other  towns  of  importance  are  LeRoy,  population  450,  Ashton,  population  400,  Tus- 
tin,  population  300,  on  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana  Railroad,  in  the  western  part  of  the 
county,  and  Sears,  on  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette,  in  the  southeastern  part  of  the 
county.  All  have  some  local  industry  devoted  to  working  up  the  products  of  the  forest. 
Hersey,  the  county  seat,  is  a  quiet  place  of  328  population,  on  the  F.  &amp;  P.  M.  Railroad, 
in  the  southwestern  part  of  the  county. 

No  county  in  the  State  has  better  water.  Not  a  township  in  the  county  but  is  well 
watered  with  spring  creeks,  and  in  this  connection  the  settlers  attention  is  called  to  the 
important  fact  that  these  streams  are  alive  with  brook  trout,  affording  to  any  who 
choose  to  seek  them,  the  sport  and  profit  of  a  good  catch  at  any  time  during  the  season, 
for  the  trout  streams  in  this  State  are  rigidly  protected  by  the  game  and  fish  laws. 
There  are  over  thirty  fine  spring  lakes  in  the  county  abounding  in  pike,  perch,  pickerel, 
bass  of  all  kinds,  and  sun  fish.  Partridge  are  plenty,  also  red  squirrels;  quail  are 
increasing,  though  the  people  of  the  county  have  been  very  chary  of  shooting  any, 
wishing  to  get  them  well  and  prolifically  located  before  hunting  them,  as  they  do  the 
partridge. 

On  the  whole,  Osceola  county  offers  to  intending  purchasers  and  settlers  splendid 
opportunities.  There  are,  at  this  writing,  103,057  acres  of  land  under  cultivation;  the 
assessed  valuation  of  the  county  is  $4,000,000;  there  is  but  5,204  acres  subject  to  sale 
or  entry.  The  pine  stump  lands  are  being  rapidly  taken  up  and  converted  to  grazing, 
for  which  purpose  they  have  proven  of  considerable  value.  There  is  some  poor  land  in 
the  county,  known  as  "  the  plains;"  originally  it  had  a  large  growth  of  Norway  and 
pine,  which  was  long  since  cut  and  marketed;  these  lands  are  of  a  flinty,  sandy  soil, 
requiring  extraordinary  rain  fall  to  moisten,  and  as  yet  no  fertilizer  has  been  discovered 
that  will  make  them  productive,  hence  all  efforts  in  this  direction  have  proved  futile. 
The  northern  half  of  the  county  possesses  some  of  the  most  desirable  sites  and  loca- 
tions for  the  herding  and  grazing  of  sheep  that  could  be  desired.  The  prices  at  which 
these  lands  are  held  is  very  reasonable,  and  as  they  have  been  burnt  over  to  some 
extent  the  cost  of  putting  them  in  shape  for  stock  purposes  is  very  small.  Root  crops 
of  all  kinds  grow  here  in  a  most  abundant  and  prolific  manner. 

Osceola  county  is  one  of  the  banner  counties  of  the  northern  half  of  the  lower 
peninsula,  and  cordially  invites  settlers  to  its  boundaries,  having  good  lands,  good 
markets,  low  taxes,  and  a  healthy,  conservative  and  growing  population.

OSCODA   COUNTY. 

Oscoda  county  was  organized  in  1881.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Montmorency, 
on  the  east  by  Alcona,  on  the  south  by  Ogemaw,  and  on  the  west  by  Crawford.  It  has 
an  area  of  365,299  acres,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  1,904.    Mio  is  the  county  seat. 

About  one-third  of  the  county  is  hard  timbered  land,  with  an  undulatory  surface. 
Another  third  is  covered  over  more  or  less  thickly  with  pine  timber,  and  the  remain- 
ing third  is  a  comparatively  level  plain  covered  with  a  growth  of  small  timber,  gener- 
ally of  the  spruce  pine  variety.  The  soil  is  of  a  heavy  clay  variety  on  the  heavier  tim- 
bered lands,  and  of  a  sandy  and  gravelly  nature  on  the  pine  lands  and  plains.  The 
subsoil  varies  from  a  clay  to  coarse  gravel.  The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Au 
Sable,  a  large  and  rapid  stream,  which  traverses  in  its  windings  about  forty  miles  of 
territory  before  it  leaves  the  county.  There  are  also  numerous  smaller  streams,  some 
of  them  in  the  northern  part  forming  the  head  waters  of  the  Thunder  bay  river.  As 
indicated  above  the  timber  on  the  heavier  lands  is  principally  beech,  maple,  oak,  ash 
and  basswood.  On  the  pine  lands  it  is  Norway  and  white  pine  and  cedar,  while  on  the 
plains  it  is  small  oak,  spruce  pine,  etc.  The  range  of  crops  is  quite  varied.  Root  crops 
do  remarkably  well.  Wheat  is  successful,  even  on  the  plain.  Clover  is  also  uniformly 
successful  where  the  land  has  been  worked  for  two  or  three  years.  The  timbered  por- 
tions are  well  adapted  to  grass.  Potatoes  are  raised  in  large  quantities  for  the  many 
lumbering  camps  in  this  and  adjoining  counties.  On  the  plains  rye  and  buckwheat 
are  sure  to  succeed  as  first  crops,  and  field  peas,  sown  broadcast,  would  probably  do 
well  preparatory  to  putting  in  winter  wheat.  After  the  first  plowing  a  greater  range 
of  scope  is  admissable.  Fruit  growing  is  in  its  infancy  in  this  county,  yet  there  are 
many  young  orchards  which  are  growing  rapidly  and  do  not  winter  kill. 

The  lightly  timbered  lands  can  be  cleared  at  from  $1  to  $4  per  acre,  while  the 
expense  on  the  heavier  timbered  lands  will  average  from  $10  to  $15. 

There  is  61,397  acres  of  public  lands  for  sale  or  entry  in  the  county. 

Unimproved  lands  range  in  price  from  fifty  cents  to  $5  per  acre,  according  to  the 
amount  of  timber  and  location.  The  "  stump  lands,"  which  were  originally  timbered 
only  in  part  with  pine,  prove  to  be  excellent  for  farming  purposes,  and  are  held  at  the 
same  price  as  unimproved  lands.  There  is  a  State  road  along  the  Au  Sable  river,  run- 
ning east  and  west.  The  local  roads  are  easily  built  and  are  smooth  and  passable  at  all 
times  of  the  year.  The  winters  are  a  little  longer,  and  fall  and  spring  somewhat 
shorter  than  farther  south.     Snow  falls  early,  from  six  inches  to  two  feet  in  depth. 

Schools,  churches,  roads  and  general  improvements  are  as  good  as  could  be  expected 
and  progressing. 


OTSEGO   COUNTY. 

Otsego  county  was  organized  in  1875.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Charlevoix 
and  Cheboygan,  on  the  east  by  Montmorency,  on  the  south  by  Crawford,  and  on 
the  west  by  Antrim  and  Charlevoix.  It  has  an  area  of  540  square  miles,  and  had 
a  population  in  1890  of  4,270.  Gaylord  is  the  county  seat.  It  is  pleasantly  located 
near  the  center  of  the  county,  and  has  an  elevation  of  800  feet  above  Lake  Huron. 
In  fact  this  county  is  the  highest  in  the  lower  peninsula  and  its  climatic  advantages 
are  unexcelled. 

The  surface  is  generally  level,  the  north  half  more  rolling,  particularly  a  belt 
running  northwest  and  southeast,  just  north  of  the  center  of  the  county.  This 
belt  has  some  nicely  improved  farms,  yet  is  rather  hilly.  Several  of  the  larger 
streams  of  the  State  have  their  headwaters  in  this  county,  viz.,  the  Au  Sable,  the 
Manistee  and  the  Cheboygan.  Small  streams  and  inland  lakes  are  quite  numerous. 
There  are  some  cedar  swamps  in  the  northwestern  towns  which  are  all  reclaimable. 
There  are  also  some  sand  plains  in  the  southeastern  and  northeastern  portions  of 
the  county  which  it  is  thought,  will  make  good  farming  lands.  There  are  several 
available  water  powers  on  the  larger  streams.  The  soil  is  generally  sand  and  grav- 
elly loam  with  a  heavy  subsoil  in  some  places.  The  timber  is  maple,  elm,  basswood 
and  hemlock,  and  about  one-fourth  of  the  county  contains  some  pine.  Winter  and 
spring  wheat,  potatoes  and  root  crops  of  all  kinds  are  raised  successfully.  Owing 
to  the  frosts  corn  is  not  a  certain  crop.  Peas,  oats  and  rye  are  staple  crops.  Grass 
and  clover  also  do  well.  The  orchards  are  as  yet  young,  but  the  prospects  are  very 
flattering  for  a  successful  fruit  country. 

The  plains  cost  $5  per  acre  to  clear,  while  the  timbered  lands  average  $20.    There 


272  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

are  good  markets  for  wood  along  the  railroad.  There  are  11,723  acres  of  land  sub- 
ject to  sale  or  entry.  Large  tracts  of  beech  and  maple  land,  unimproved,  can  be 
had  at  prices  ranging  from  $4  to  $10  per  acre.  These  lands  are  in  good  demand. 
The  "stump  lands"  are  also  numerous  and  cheap.  They  have  not  been  extensively 
cultivated,  but  as  far  as  tested  produce  well.  A  State  road  running  east  and 
west  between  Lake  Michigan  and  Lake  Huron,  passes  through  the  center  of  the 
county. 

OTTAWA    COUNTY. 

Ottawa  county  was  organized  in  1837.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Muskegon,  on 
the  east  by  Kent,  on  the  south  by  Allegan  and  on  the  west  by  Lake  Michigan.  It  has 
an  area  of  540  square  miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  35,358.  There  about  10,000 
Hollanders,  located  principally  in  the  southern  part  of  the  county,  where  they  have  a 
prosperious  colony.  Grand  Haven,  a  city  of  5,023  inhabitants,  situated  at  the  mouth 
of  Grand  river,  is  the  county  seat.    Holland  City  had  a  population  in  1890  of  3,945. 

Much  of  the  surface  of  the  county  is  level;  the  balance  is  gently  rolling,  and  all  sus- 
ceptible to  drainage.  The  Grand  river  flows  through  the  county  from  east  and  west. 
It  is  navigable  for  small  vessels  as  far  up  as  Grand  Rapids.  The  county  is  also  watered 
by  the  Bass,  Black  and  Pigeon  rivers.  Crockery,  Deer,  Sand  and  other  creeks,  and  by 
Black,  Pigeon  and  Spring  lakes.  There  is  a  large  stretch  of  swamp  or  wet  prairie, 
which  is  all  reclaimable,  and  has  a  rich  soil,  raising  fine  grass.  The  entire  county  by 
proper  and  inexpensive  cultivation,  could  be  made  arable  and  adapted  to  grazing. 
There  are  no  water  powers,  owing  to  the  level  character  of  the  land.  The  soil  is  prin- 
cipally of  a  sandy  nature  with  a  subsoil  of  gravel.  There  is  some  loam  with  a  clay 
subsoil  in  different  sections  throughout  the  county. 

The  timber  is  oak,  beech,  maple  and  pine.  Corn,  wheat  and  all  cereals,  root  crops 
and  garden  vegetables  flourish  in  the  warm  quick  soil,  while  the  fruits  cannot  be 
excelled.  This  county  lies  in  the  celebrated  fruit  belt  of  western  Michigan,  and  peaches, 
pears,  apples,  plums,  cherries,  currants  and  grapes  grow  in  great  abundance,  and  are 
shipped  to  the  Chicago  and  Milwaukee  markets,  where  there  is  a  great  demand  for 
Michigan  fruit. 

The  cost  of  clearing  averages  from  $12  to  $15  per  acre.  Wood  finds  a  ready  sale 
throughout  the  county,  hardwood  bringing  from  $4  to  $5  per  cord,  and  softwood  from 
$2  to  $2.50.  There  is  no  government  land  in  the  market,  with  the  exception  of  one 
80-acre  tract.  There  are  440  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  The  stump  lands 
of  the  county  are  receiving  considerable  attention,  and  no  doubt  will  develop  into  good 
fruit  and  farming  lands.  They  are  held  at  prices  within  the  reach  of  all.  Improved 
farms  range  in  price  from  $30  to  $100  per  acre.  Good  wagon  roads  bring  all  parts  of 
the  county  into  easy  communication  with  the  markets.  The  lake  winds  moderate  both 
extremes  of  temperature.  The  average  temperature  for  the  month  of  January,  during 
the  last  ten  years,  was  26°  Fahr.,  while  the  average  temperature  for  June  was  62.7°. 

The  schools  of  the  county  are  very  prosperous.  At  Holland  is  located  Hope  college, 
an  institution  extensively  patronized  by  local  and  non-resident  Hollanders.  Agricult- 
ure is  the  principal  industry.  One  of  the  largest  flouring  mills  in  the  State  is  located 
at  Holland.  Large  machine  shops  and  engine  works  are  located  at  Ferrysburg.  Labor 
is  in  fair  demand,  both  on  farms  and  among  the  lumbering  and  manufacturing  indus- 
tries, wages  ranging  from  $1  to  $1.25  per  day  for  common  labor.  Skilled  labor  com- 
mands proportionately  higher  wages.  The  Chicago  &amp;  West  Michigan,  its  Grand 
Rapids  branch,  and  the  Detroit,  Grand  Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee  railroads  traverse  the 
county.  The  lake  ports  also  afford  excellent  shipping  facilities,  and  enjoy  an  exten- 
sive commerce. 

Grand  Haven  for  many  years  was  a  very  large  lumber  point.  Several  extensive  saw 
mills  were  located  there,  all  of  which  have  removed,  having  exhausted  the  supply  of 
logs.  It  is,  however,  claimed  that  other  manufactories  are  locating  and  the  city  is 
becoming  a  manufacturing  point  of  importance.  The  charcoal  furnace  at  Fruitport 
has  produced  a  large  amount  of  pig  iron  of  a  very  superior  quality.  Ship  building  has 
for  a  long  time  been  an  important  business  at  Grand  Haven,  and  the  sands  in  the  bluffs 
may  sometime  be  utilized  in  the  manufacture  of  glass  and  stone.  The  excellent  ship- 
ping facilities  will  be  a  great  inducement  to  manufacturers.

PRESQUE   ISLE  COUNTY. 

BY   W.    A.   FKENCH. 

The  principal  industries  of  this  county  consists  of  lumbering  pine  and  cedar,  also 
farming.  Fully  65,000,000  feet  is  annually  lumbered  from  this  county.  There  yet 
remains  of  uncut  pine  250,000,000  feet.  There  are  150,000  cedar  ties  marketed 
annually  and  as  much  more  each  of  pine  posts,  and  there  are  yet  remaining  large 
quantities.  The  hemlock  timber  is  practically  untouced  and  runs  up  in  the 
hundred  millions.  This  applies  to  hardwood  consisting  of  red  oak,  maple,  hard  birch, 
beech,  elm  and  basswood,  in  which  the  county  is  well  supplied.  All  products  are 
shipped  by  water  (Lake  Huron),  there  being  no  railroads  in  this  county.  Mineral 
has   been  found  in  limited  quantities. 

For  agricultural  purposes  this  county  stands  high  for  the  following  products  and 
cannot  be  surpassed:  Hay,  two  and  one-half  to  three  tons  to  the  acre;  peas,  thirty 
to  forty-five  bushels  to  the  acre;  potatoes  (no  bugs)  300  to  400  bushels  to  the  acre, 
in  fact  all  roots  are  of  the  best  growth  and  also  flavor,  the  soil  is  peculiarly  adapted 
for  the  cultivation  of  roots.  Wheat  is  another  grain  that  this  soil  excels  in.  It 
grows  very  plump  and  full  and  in  nearly  every  case  is  over  weight. 

Considerable  limestone  is  to  be  found  in  the  county,  The  soil  is  a  very  nice  clay 
loam.  No  navigable  rivers  in  this  county.  The  principal  rivers  for  lumbering  are 
the  Ocqueoc  river,  Swan  river  and  other  small  streams.  Rogers  City  is  the  county 
seat  and  chief  city  of  the  county,  population  1,000,  industries  milling.  There  is 
considerable  fishing  along  the  lake  fronting  this  county,  but  it  is  carried  on  by 
Cheboygan  and  Alpena  fishermen,  as  we  have  no  railroads  for  shipping.  The  ganie 
consists  of  partridges  in  great  quantities.  Deer  and  bear  (black)  are  found  in 
limited  quantities.  Wages  command  $1.50  to  S1.65,  skilled  $2.50  to  S4.  Improved 
land  $25  per  acre,  unimproved  $1.50  to  $5  per  acre.  Schools  are  fairly  distributed 
throughout  the  county.  Farm  labor  $22  per  month.  Fruit  cultivated  is  limited, 
but  the  soil  and  climate  is  perfect  for  apples  and  plums.  No  worms  ever  trouble 
them  and  they  have  an  excellent  flavor.  Wild  fruit,  huckleberries  and  red  rasp- 
berries are  abundant,  also  blackberries. 


ROSCOMMON  COUNTY. 

Roscommon  county  was  organized  in  1875.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by 
Crawford,  on  the  east  by  Ogemaw,  on  the  south  by  Gladwin  and  Clair,  on  the 
west  by  Missaukee.  It  has  an  area  of  576  square  miles  and  had  a  population 
in  1890  of  2,033.  Roscommon,  an  enterprising  town  of  511  inhabitants,  located  in 
in   the   northern   part  of   the   county,   is  the  county   seat. 

The  surface  of  the  county  is  for  the  most  part  level,  interspersed  with  ridges. 
It  is  well  watered  by  the  south  branch  of  the  Au  Sable  and  the  headwaters 
of  the  Muskegon  rivers,  also  by  Houghton,  Higgins.  and  other  lakes.  There  is 
considerable  swamp  land  in  the  county,  nearly  all  of  which,  when  reclaimed, 
would  make  admirable  meadow  lands  or  cranberay  marshes.  The  altitude  of  the 
county  is  such  that  there  are  streams  flowing  both  east  and  west,  and  the  fall 
is  such  as  to  make  plenty  of  available  water  power  on  several  of  the  larger 
streams.  There  is  considerable  land  known  as  "sand  plains,"  some  of  which  is 
already  taken  up  by  homesteaders.  The  soil  is  a  sandy  loam  on  the  high  lands, 
with  a  fair  percentage  of  clay.  There  is  generally  a  sandy  subsoil  on  the  lower 
lands  near   the  marshes   and  streams. 

The  timber  is  principally  white,  Norway  and  spruce  pine,  with  occasional  belts 
of  beech,  maple,  oak,  cedar,  tamarack,  spruce  and  balsam.  Potatoes  have  thus 
far  been  the  most  successful  crop  on  the  heavier  timbered  lands,  although  the 
earlier  and  hardier  varieties  of  corn  can  be  as  successfully  produced  as  in  any 
part  of  the  state.  But  little  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  raising  of  the  cereals, 
owing  to  the  lack  of  milling  facilities,  but  wherever  tests  have  been  made,  the 
results  have  been  uniformly  good.  Wheat,  oats,  rye  buckwheat,  and  millet  have 
yielded  very  satisfactory  crops.  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  experiment  of 
planting  amber  cane  be  tried  on  the  lighter  soils,  as  this  cane  has  been  grown 
very  successfully  on   light   soils  in   other   parts  of    the  State. 

There   are  a   number    of    young    orchards    with    flattering    prospects    of    future

success.  The  hardier  varieties  of  apples  should  always  be  chosen  in  setting  out 
trees.    Berries  grow   in  great   abundance. 

The  cost  of  clearing  varies  from  $5  to  $15,  according  to  the  kind  of  timber 
on  the  lands.  There  are  good  local  markets  for  wood  along  the  line  of  railroad,  hard- 
wood bringing  $1.50  per  cord  stove  length,  and  softwood  from  75  cents  to  SI, 
There  are  77,857  acres  of  land  subject  to  sale  or  entry.  There  are  large  tracts 
of  "stump  land,"  which  have  a  good  soil,  and  make  very  desirable  farms,  and 
can  be  had  at  prices  ranging  from  $1  to  $2.50  per  acre.  There  is  a  State  road 
running  from  Roscommon,  via  Houghton  lake,  to  Midland,  also  a  complete  sys- 
tem of  local  roads  which,  owing  to  the  sandy  nature  of  the  soil,  are  always  in 
a  good  condition.  Snow  falls  by  Nov.  1,  to  an  average  depth  of  sixteen  inches, 
the  ground  freezing  but  little.  Plowing  begins  from  the  first  to  the  middle  of 
May. 

The  schools  are  as  yet  few,  but  compare  favorably  with  those  of  the  surround- 
ing counties.  Lumbering  is,  and  will  be  for  years,  the  principal  industry.  Wood, 
ties,  posts  and  telegraph  poles  are  gotten  out  in  vast  quantities,  employing  a 
large  number  of  men,  wages  ranging  from  $20  to  $30  per  month  with  board. 
The  Mackinac  division  of  the  Michigan  Central  Railroad  passes  through  the 
county,  affording  excellent  market  facilities.  There  are  also  one  or  two  logging 
roads  in  the  southern  part  of  the  county.  Higgins  Lake  is  a  delightful  summer 
resort  and  is  visited  every  season  by  a  large  number  of  hay  fever  and  asthmatic 
patients,   who  generally   find  speedy  relief. 

SAGINAW  COUNTY. 
BY   SAMUEL   G.   HIGGINS,    SAGINAW,   E.   S. 

The  Saginaw  Valley  is  one  of  the  richest  agricultural  regions  of  the  State,  possessing 
an  alluvial  soil,  very  productive,  adapted  to  the  growth  of  wheat,  corn,  oats,  rye,  barley, 
peas,  potatoes,  hay,  and,  in  short,  all  farm  crops,  fruits  and  vegetables.  Saginaw  county 
lies  in  the  center  of  the  Saginaw  Valley  and  occupies  588  square  miles,  or  376.320 
acres.  Of  this  area  275,508  acres  are  in  farms,  174,209  acres  being  improved,  and  102,- 
299  acres  unimproved.  The  Cass,  Flint,  Shiawassee  and  Tittabawassee  rivers  unite 
near  the  center  of  the  county,  just  above  the  city  of  Saginaw,  the  county  seat  and 
from  the  Saginaw  river,  which  flows  north  eighteen  miles  to  Saginaw  bay,  an  arm  of 
Lake  Huron,  the  whole  county  is  well  watered,  springs  and  flowing  wells  being 
abundant.  Beech,  maple,  oak,  ash  and  other  timbers  are  plentiful.  Great  improve- 
ments have  been  made  in  drainage,  as  roads  have  been  opened  up  and  the  lands 
cleared.  A  system  of  Macadamized  roads  is  being  planned,  which  will  be  of  great 
benefit  to  the  whole  county.  Excellent  unimproved  farming  lands,  well  located  and  on 
good  roads  can  be  purchased  for  $5  to  $15  per  acre,  on  long  time  and  reasonable  inter 
est.     Improved  farms  near  the  city  are  worth  $50  to  $100  per  acre,  and  even  higher. 

In  1891  the  yield  of  wheat  in  Saginaw  county  was  519,632  bushels,  an  average  of  19.32 
bushels  per  acre.  The  corn  crop  was  1,133,569  bushels,  72  bushels  per  acre.  The 
oat  crop  was  1,189,597  bushels,  41  bushels  per  acre.  The  land  is  especially  well  adapted 
to  dairy  farming,  the  cheese  product  for  1892  being  over  8,000  pounds. 

The  population  of  Saginaw  county,  according  to  the  United  States  census  of  1890, 
was  82,273,  an  increase  of  40  per  cent  over  the  census  of  1880. 

The  Saginaw  Valley  has  long  been  known  as  the  most  important  lumber  manufac- 
turing center  in  the  country,  and  this  fact  has  given  rise  to  the  erroneous  impression 
that  the  land  was  unsuitable  for  farming  purposes.  But  a  very  large  portion  of  the 
territory  is  hardwood  land,  and  many  of  the  best  farms  in  Saginaw  county  were  origi- 
nally pine  forests.  Saginaw  county  is  one  of  the  largest  salt  producing  districts  in  the 
United  States,  the  brine  being  pumped  from  a  depth  of  about  700  feet  and  evaporated 
by  means  of  the  exhaust  steam  from  the  engines  of  the  various  factories.  Chemical 
works  are  in  contemplation  to  manufacture  from  the  brine  many  articles  of  great  com- 
mercial value,  soda  ash  for  making  glass  and  soap,  caustic  soda  for  making  wood  pulp 
paper,  etc. 

The  city  of  Saginaw  is  a  large  manufacturing  city  of  60,000  population,  which  gives 
the  farmers  an  excellent  market  for  their  produce.  Eleven  lines  of  railroad  radiate 
from  Saginaw,  reaching  all  parts  of  the  country.  In  the  early  days  Saginaw  bore  the 
reputation  of  having  an  unhealthful  climate.  The  large  areas  of  uncultivated  and 
undrained  land  naturally  produced  malaria,  but  with  the  settlement  and  drainage  of 
the  lands  these  conditions  have  long  since  changed,  and  this  is  one  of  the  most  health-

ful  sections  in  the  United  States.  The  summers  are  delightful,  the  nights  being  cool 
and  refreshing  even  during  the  midsummer  season.  The  autumns  are  the  perfection  of 
fine  weather,  continuing  often  until  near  Christmas  before  snowfall  commences.  Then 
follows  a  steady  winter  with  plenty  of  snow,  giving  good  sleighing  until  March.  Farm- 
ing operations  commence  about  the  middle  of  April.  Tornadoes  and  violent  wind- 
storms, blizzards  and  hail  storms,  such  as  often  sweep  with  such  terrible  force  over 
certain  sections  of  the  country,  are  unknown  in  the  Saginaw  Valley.  There  are  usu- 
ally no  strong  winds  in  winter,  especially  in  the  coldest  weather.  The  great  lakes, 
surrounding  on  every  side,  have  a  marked  influence  in  moderating  the  climate,  cooling 
the  extreme  heat  of  summer,  and  tempering  the  cold  winds  of  winter.  The  air  is  fresh 
and  invigorating,  imparting  health  and  energy  to  the  people,  in  this  respect  being 
much  superior  to  more  southerly  locations. 

The  extensive  coal  beds  recently  discovered,  underlying  nearly  the  whole  county,  will 
greatly  increase  the  growth  of  manufactures.  This  is  the  nearest  coal  to  the  rich  Bes- 
semer iron  ores  of  the  upper  peninsula  of  Michigan,  and  it  is  expected  that  large  iron 
industries  will  soon  be  located  in  Saginaw.  The  manufactures  of  Saginaw  include  lum- 
ber, lath,  shingles,  salt,  boxes,  brick,  cigars,  brooms,  dress  braids,  carriages,  cash  car- 
riers, crackers,  confectionery,  dust  separators,  files,  flour,  feed,  harness,  lumber  tools, 
hoops,  staves,  heading,  leather,  lime,  graphite,  furniture,  stone,  marble,  railway  gates, 
woodenware,  rules,  fertilizers,  roofing,  saws,  soap,  potash,  wire  goods,  awnings,  baskets, 
shade  rollers,  seed  cleaners,  washboards,  pulleys,  boiler  works,  machine  shops,  rail- 
road shops,  etc.  There  is  no  better  location  in  the  country  for  planing  mills,  sash,  door 
and  blind  factories,  and  other  industries  using  timber  and  lumber,  as  the  supply  of  raw 
materials  is  very  large.  The  lumber  mills  draw  great  quantities  of  logs  from  the 
Georgian  bay  region,  across  Lake  Huron.  Over  300,000,000  feet  of  pine  saw  logs  are 
being  rafted  from  that  district  to  the  Saginaw  river  this  year.  The  hardwood  in  the 
territory  north  and  west  of  Saginaw,  suitable  for  the  manufacture  of  furniture,  carriages, 
etc.,  is  practically  as  yet  untouched.  This  is  most  excellent  farming  land,  and  the 
timber  taken  oflf  in  clearing  will  pay  a  large  portion  of  the  purchase  price  of  the  land. 
The  combination  of  excellent  farming  land  with  good  markets  close  at  hand  makes 
this  country  very  desirable  for  the  farmer. 


SANILAC  COUNTY. 

Sanilac  county  was  organized  in  1848.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Huron, 
on  the  east  by  Lake  Huron,  on  the  south  by  St.  Clair  and  Lapeer,  and  on  the  west 
by  Tuscola  and  Lapeer.  It  has  an  area  of  990  square  miles,  and  had  a  population 
in  1890  of  32,589.  Sanilac  Center,  formerly  Sandusky,  a  thriving  village  of  400 
inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 

Along  the  extreme  eastern  and  western  boundaries,  and  also  through  the  central 
portions  of  the  county  the  surface  is  comparatively  level;  between  these  lines  are 
ridges  gradually  breaking  into  short  hills  which  form  the  water-shed  of  the  county. 
The  general  appearance  might  be  decided  as  undulatory.  Through  the  center  of 
the  county  extends  the  so-called  "great  swamp,"  which  is  rapidly  being  drained 
and  cultivated,  proving  itself  among  the  most  fertile  and  productive  land  in  the 
State.  The  county  is  watered  by  the  Black  and  Cass  rivers.  Elk  creek  and  numer- 
ous smaller  streams,  many  of  the  latter  flowing  into  Lake  Huron.  There  are  desir- 
able water  powers  on  Black  river  and  some  of  the  creeks.  The  soil  along  the  lake 
shore  varies  from  sand  to  clay,  but  is  nowhere  unproductive.  On  the  ridges  it  is 
generally  clay,  with  occasional  patches  of  lighter  soil.  The  subsoil  Is  generally 
clay.  The  timber  is  mainly  beech,  maple,  pine,  hemlock,  birch  and  oak,  with  ash 
and  cedar  on  the  low  lands.  Wheat,  barley  and  oats  are  the  staple  crops.  Corn 
and  beans  are  also  successfully  cultivated.  Potatoes  and  garden  vegetables  are 
also  raised  in  abundance  throughout  the  entire  county.  The  reclaimed  swamp  lands 
are  especially  valuable  as  meadow  lands,  and  the  business  of  cutting  and  shipping 
hay  has  become  extensive  and  profitable.  In  the  older  townships  fruit  raising  is 
already  an  important  industry.  Young  orchards  present  a  thrifty  appearance  in  the 
newer  townships,  and  the  future  of  this  county  as  a  fruit  growing  region  is  well 
assured. 

The  cost  of  clearing  land  has  been  greatly  reduced  by  the  great  fires  of  1881, 
the  present  cost  averaging  from  $6  to  $15  per  acre.  Good  wood  markets  are  found 
along  the  line  of  the  Port  Huron  and  Northwestern  Railroad.  Hardwood  brings 
from  $2  to  $3  per  cord,  and  softwood  from  75  cents  to  $1.  There  are  507  acres  of 
land  subject   to   sale  or   entry.     Government   lands   are   no  longer  in   the  market. 


276  Michigan  and  its  Eesources. 

Plenty  of  good  unimproved  agricultural  lands  are  to  be  had  at  prices  ranging 
from  S5  to  $15  per  acre.  They  are  near  market,  have  a  good  soil,  and  are  rap- 
idly increasing  in  value.  There  are  also  large  tracts  of  "'stump  lands"  which 
have  enough  timber  on  them  for  domestic  use,  and  can  be  had  at  correspond- 
ingly low  prices.  Some  of  the  best  farms  in  the  county  have  been  made  out 
of  these  lands.  Improved  farms  range  in  price  from  $20  to  $50  per  acre,  accord- 
ing to   the  location. 

The  Forestville  and  Tuscola,  Sanilac  and  Tuscola,  Lexington  and  Lapeer,  lake 
shore  north  and  south  road,  and  Lexington  and  Minden  State  roads  thoroughly 
open  up  the  county.  The  first  snow  falls  in  December,  the  depth  varying  with 
the  season.  Oftentimes  there  are  five  or  six  weeks  of  good  sleighing.  Plowing 
usually   begins   in  April. 

School  districts  are  organized  in  every  township.  The  school  buildings  are 
generally  comfortabe,  and  the  schools  themselves  exceptionally  good.  Agriculture 
is  the  principal  industry,  although  considerable  lumbering  is  still  done.  Large 
quantities  of  posts,  ties  and  telegraph  poles  are  gotten  out  every  season,  creating 
a  steady  demand  for  labor  at  wages  ranging  from  820  to  $26  per  month  with 
board.  The  Port  Huron  &amp;  Northwestern  Railroad  extends  through  the  county 
in  two  divisions;  the  Sand  Beach  division  running  from  south  to  north  into 
Huron  county,  at  a  distance  of  from  six  to  twelve  miles  from  the  lake  shore, 
and  the  Saginaw  division  running  in  a  northwesterly  direction  from  Port  Huron, 
and  passing  through  the  southwest  portion  of  the  county,  touching  at  Marlette. 
Lexington,  on  the  Lake  shore,  twelve  miles  north  of  Port  Huron,  is  the  largest 
town  in  the  county.  It  has  a  fine  flouring  mill,  a  woolen  mill,  foundry,  two 
planing  mills,  and  a  large  interior  trade.  It  is  visited  regularly  by  several  lines 
of  steamers  during  the  season  for  navigation. 


SCHOOLCRAFT. 

BY   D.   W.    THOMPSON. 

The  principal  manufacturing  industries  is  in  pine,  cedar  and  hardwood  lumber,  of 
which  the  output  is  approximately  valued  at  810,000,000  annually,  and  the  value  of  the 
plants  for  the  manufacture  of  the  same  $1,000,000.  Iron  output  36,000  tons  annually, 
value  of  furnaces,  etc.,  $150,000  to  $300,000  including  charcoal  kilns;  $250,000  is 
annually  paid  for  wood  for  charcoal.  Lime  kilns  ship  30,000  barrels  of  lime  each 
season.  Agricultural  interests  are  comparatively  small,  although  there  is  perhaps  5,000 
acres  under  cultivation,  and  enough  potatoes  and  turnips  raised  for  local  consumption, 
and  perhaps  half  the  hay  that  is  used  is  grown  here.  Oats  and  wheat  but  little 
grown,  as  there  are  no  flouring  mills  in  this  county.  The  small  fruits  grow  in  abund- 
ance, and  apples,  pears  and  plums  do  well.  The  soil  is  a  sandy  loam  with  subsoil  of 
clay  in  places.  Country  slightly  rolling,  drained  by  the  Manistique,  Taquamanon  and 
Sturgeon  rivers  with  their  numerous  branches.  The  country  is  dotted  with  many 
lakes,  in  which  is  found  fine  fishing,  bass,  perch,  pickeral,  etc.,  and  the  streams  are  full 
of  trout  and  other  fish.  There  is  upward  of  700,000  acres  of  unimproved  lands,  more 
than  half  of  which  is  well  timbered.  Game,  such  as  bear,  wolves,  deer,  partridge 
and  smaller  game  is  plentiful,  while  on  the  lakes  and  streams  are  to  be  found  many 
ducks.     Streams  are  only  navigable  for  logs  at  present. 

Improved  lands  are  valued  at  about  $30  per  acre,  and  unimproved  lands  from  fifty 
cents  to  $50.  There  are  no  cities  in  the  county,  and  but  one  incorporated  village,  Man- 
istique, the  county  seat,  which  has  a  population  of  5,000,  is  at  the  mouth  of  the  Manis- 
tique river,  where  nearly  all  the  industries  of  the  county  are  located,  A.  Booth 
has  a  fishery  here  employing  about  $300,000  capital,  and  the  vessel  interests  of  the 
county  are  about  $500,000.  There  are  two  railroads  besides  several  private  logging 
railroads.  Besides  the  county  seat  there  are  several  hamlets  with  from  300  to  a  1,000 
inhabitants  each,  viz.:  Cooks,  Thompson,  South  Manistique,  Whitedale  and  Seney.  We 
have  good  schools  and  eight  or  ten  churches.  Farm  labor  is  820  per  month,  common 
labor  $1.50  to  82  per  day  and  skilled  labor  $2.25  to  $8.  Cost  of  clearing  timber  lands 
$20  per  acre.  Kiln  wood,  four  foot,  $1.50  per  cord,  for  household  use  $2.75,  but  little 
used;  eighteen  inch  wood,  $1.50.    No  stumping  has  been  done.

SHIAWASSEE    COUNTY. 
BY   A.    L.   BAIRD,   CORUNNA,   MICH. 

Shiawassee  county  was  organized  in  1837.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Saginaw, 
on  the  east  by  Genesee,  on  the  south  by  Livingston  and  Ingham,  and  on  the  west  by 
Clinton  county.  It  has  an  area  of  530  square  miles  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of 
30.950.      Corunna,  a  city  of   1,500  inhabitants,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  northern  half  of  "the  county  is  comparatively  level,  while  the  southern  half  is 
more  rolling.  In  the  southern  portion  are  also  a  number  of  sandy  plains,  commonly 
called  oak  openings,  and  numerous  marshes,  some  of  which  are  quite  extensive  and 
which  have  outlets  in  the  Lookingglass  and  Shiawassee  rivers.  The  northern  part 
of  the  county  has  several  thousand  acres  of  tamarack  swamp  and  open  marsh,  which 
are  drained  by  the  Shiawassee,  Maple  and  Bad  rivers.  These  swamps  are  nearly  all 
reclaimable  and  are  being  ditched  quite  extensively.  The  principal  water  powers  are 
on  the  Shiawassee  river,  at  Byron,  Knagg's  Bridge,  Shiawasseetown,  Corunna  and 
West  Haven.  The  general  character  of  the  soil  in  the  southern  part  of  the  county 
is  sandy  and  gravelly,  while  in  the  northern  portions  it  is  of  a  clay  and  clay  loam 
mixed  with  gravel.  The  subsoil  is  generally  clay.  The  timber  is  oak,  beech,  maple, 
basswood  and  elm.  The  Detroit.  Grand  Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee,  the  Jackson,  Lansing  &amp; 
Saginaw,  the  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk,  the  Toledo,  Ann  Arbor  &amp;  North  Michigan,  and 
the  Cincinnati,  Saginaw  &amp;  Mackinaw  railroads  traverse  the  county,  affording  excellent 
market  facilities. 

The  county  is  well  supplied  with  both  hard  and  soft  water,  making  it  one  of  the 
most  beautiful,  productive  and  healthiest  counties  in  the  State.  The  staple  crops 
are  wheat,  corn,  oats,  potatoes,  beans,  and  vegetables  of  all  descriptions.  As  a  wheat 
producing  county,  it  stands  in  the  first  rank.  Apples  are  the  principal  fruit  crop, 
although  pears,  plums,  the  smaller  fruits  and  berries  are  raised  in  abundance,  and  are 
shipped  in  large  quantities  to  the  Detroit,  Chicago  and  Saginaw  markets. 

Improved  farms  range  in  price  from  S30  to  $100  per  acre,  with  a  low  percentage 
on  the  market.  Unimproved  lands  are  generally  held  for  the  timber  and  are  worth 
from  §20  to  SlOO  per  acre. 

A  large  coal  mine  is  in  active  operation  near  Corunna,  producing  about  100  tons  of 
coal  daily.     The  coal  tract  is  estimated  to  cover  hundreds  of  acres. 

The  schools  of  this  county  are  all  in  first-class  condition.  The  public  schools  of 
Corunna  and  Owosso  attract  a  large  non-resident  attendance.  Agriculture  is  the 
principal  industry,  though  large  manufacturing  establishments  have  been  erected  in 
Owosso  during  the  past  few  years,  including  furniture,  mattress,  carriage,  shook, 
handle  and  Toledo,  Ann  Arbor  &amp;  North  Michigan  car  shops,  and  burial  case  factories. 
On  account  of  its  railroad  facilities,  Durand,  Vernon,  Corunna  and  Owosso  all  furnish 
excellent  inducements  to  manufacturers.     Owosso  had  a  population  of  6,564  in  1890. 


ST.   CLAIR  COUNTY. 

St.  Clair  county  was  organized  in  1821.  It  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Sanilac, 
on  the  east  by  Lake  Huron  and  St.  Clair  river,  on  the  south  by  Macomb  and  Lake 
St.  Clair,  and  on  the  west  by  Lapeer  and  Macomb.  It  has  an  area  of  720  square 
miles,  and  had  a  population  in  1890  of  52,105.  Port  Huron,  a  city  of  13,543  inhabi- 
tants, situated  at  the  head  of  St.  Clair  river,  is  the  county  seat. 

The  surface  of  this  county  is  generally  level,  although  there  are  portions  of  several 
townships  which  are  quite  rolling.  There  is  considerable  swamp  land  scattered 
over  the  county,  nearly  all  of  which  is  reclaimable.  There  is  also  considerable  sandy 
land  along  the  lake  shore.  The  county  is  well  watered  by  the  Black,  Belle,  and 
Pine  rivers,  also  by  Smith  and  Mill  creeks,  and  numerous  smaller  streams.  Owing 
to  the  level  character  of  the  land  there  is  but  little  water  power  to  be  found.  The 
general  character  of  the  soil  is  a  clay  loam  with  a  clay  subsoil.  The  only  excep- 
tions are  found  in  the  townships  of  Fort  Gratiot,  Clyde,  Kimball,  and  Port  Huron, 
where  much  of  the  soil  is  sandy.  A  clay  subsoil  underlies  the  sand,  except  in  some 
portions  of  Fort  Gratiot  township,  where  the  sand  is  very  deep.  The  timber  is 
maple,  beech,  oak,  elm,  and  some  scattering  pine.  Hay  is  the  staple  crop,  although 
wheat  and  other  serials  are  raised  successfully.  The  lighter  soil  is  especially 
adapted  to  vegetables,  which   are   raised    in    great    quantities    for    the    Port   Huron 


278  Michigan  and  its  Kesodrces. 

market.  Apples,  plums,  cherries,  and  some  varieties  of  grapes  are  grown  in  this 
county  with  success.  Thousands  of  bushels  of  apples  are  shipped  every  year  to 
Lake  Superior  ports. 

Clearing  costs  from  $5  to  $15  per  acre,  according  to  the  density  of  the  timber. 
There  are  no  public  land  for  sale  or  entry  in  the  county.  There  are  plenty  of 
unimproved  agricultural  lands  near  the  railroads,  which  can  be  had  at  prices  rang- 
ing from  $10  to  $25  per  acre.  There  is  also  considerable  stump  land,  with  the  very 
best  of  soil,  to  be  had  at  moderate  prices.  The  Port  Huron  and  Detroit,  the  Romeo 
and  St.  Clair,  and  the  Port  Huron  and  Lexington  State  roads  run  through  the 
county  in  different  directions.  The  local  roads  are  constructed  on  section  lines, 
and  as  a  rule  at-e  kept  in  a  fair  condition.  Snow  falls  in  December  and  disappears  by 
the  last  of  February.  Plowing  begins  in  April,  or  as  soon  as  the  frost  is  out  of  the 
ground. 

The  schools  of  the  county  have  improved  rapidly  during  the  past  few  years.  The 
public  schools  of  Port  Huron  are  especially  deserving  of  mention,  as  they  sustain  a 
high  reputation,  not  only  at  home,  but  all  through  the  "  Thumb  "  peninsula,  and 
even  Canada.  Agriculture,  lumbering,  charcoal  burning,  the  manufacture  of 
staves,  etc.,  and  tishing  are  the  principal  industries.  One  of  the  richest  salt  beds 
in  the  United  States  has  recently  been  discovered  at  Marine  City.  These  enter- 
prises create  a  steady  demand  for  common  labor  at  wages  ranging  from  $15  to  $22 
per  month  with  board.  The  Chicago  &amp;  Grand  Trunk,  the  Detroit  branch  of  the 
Grand  Trunk,  the  Port  Huron  &amp;  Northwestern,  its  Lake  Shore  branch,  its  Almont 
division,  and  a  branch  of  the  Canada  Southern  Railroad  traverses  the  county.  The 
Grand  Trunk  Railroad  has  the  finest  tunnel  in  the  world  connecting  its  lines  between 
east  and  west  at  Port  Huron.  (See  description  and  illustrations.)  Port  Huron  is 
very  favorably  situated  as  to  its  shipping  advantages,  and  no  doubt  will  become  a 
great  manufacturing  center.  It  is  already  the  seat  of  a  flourishing  commerce,  and 
its  docks  and  harbors  are  lined  with  vessels  of  every  description  from  the  opening 
to  the  close  of  navigation.  At  Marine  City  are  located  ship  yards  where  some  of 
the  largest  of  lake  vessels  are  constructed,  while  at  the  city  of  St.  Clair  are  the 
celebrated  Oakland  mineral  springs,  which  are  visited  annually  by  thousands  of 
people,  and  which  have  the  best  of  hotel  and  bathing  facilities.  St.  Clair  as  a 
county  is  admirably  adapted  to  grazing,  and  already  attention  has  been  directed  to 
the  subject  of  stock  raising,  which  will  eventually  prove  one  of  the  most  important 
enterprises  of  the  county. 


ST.    JOSEPH    COUNTY. 
BY    LEVI   T.    HULL,   CONSTANTINE,    MICH. 

St.  Joseph  county  lies  mainly  in  the  valley  of  the  St.  Joseph  river,  a  noble  stream, 
which  traverses  the  county  from  the  northeast  corner  to  its  southwest  corner.  Nine 
of  its  sixteen  townships  border  upon  it.  The  other  streams  in  the  county,  affording 
sufficient  volume  of  water  for  water  power  to  drive  manufacturing  machinery,  are. 
Pigeon  river,  Fawn  river.  Hog  creek.  Big  and  Little  Swan  creeks,  Nottawa  creek.  Bear 
creek,  Portage  river.  Little  Portage,  the  Rocky  and  Mill  creeks.  All  of  these  have 
been  improved  and  the  power  utilized.  The  St.  Joseph  river  is  dammed  at  Three 
Rivers  and  Constantine,  and  affords  a  large  amount  of  cheap  power.  These  streams, 
through  nearly  all  their  length  in  the  county,  flow  over  gravelly  beds,  between  high 
banks,  and  at  their  highest  flood  do  little  or  no  damage  by  covering  adjacent  lands. 
No  purer  or  more  sparkling  water  is  to  be  found  in  the  streams  of  any  section  of  the 
United  States.  There  are  three  large  prairies  in  the  county:  Nottawa,  Sturgis  and 
White  Pigeon.  The  greater  proportion  of  the  balance  of  the  county  is  undulating, 
gravelly  or  sandy  loam,  broken  in  a  few  townships  by  hilly  or  rolling  land  of  similar 
quality.  The  land  is  all  productive.  Originally  there  was  a  large  amount  of  excel- 
lent timber  in  the  county,  consisting  of  burr,  white,  red  and  yellow  oak,  maple,  beech, 
ash,  elm,  hickory,  whitewood.  butternut,  cherry  and  blackwalnut,  but  it  has  been 
mostly  removed.  Wheat,  corn,  rye,  oats,  beans,  hay,  potatoes  and  essential  oils  are  the 
chief  productions,  and  large  quantities  are  annually  shipped.  The  farmers  who  have 
given  attention  to  raising  good  horses,  cattle,  sheep  and  swine  have  usually  found 
the  industry  profitable.  The  essential  oil  of  peppermint  has  long  been  a  staple  product 
with  many  farmers.  Of  late  years  spearmint,  wormwood  and  tansey  oils  have  been 
raised,  but   not  to  such    an  extent  as   peppermint.     Until    within  a  few   years,-  the

peppermint  was  all  raised  on  the  uplands,  but  it  is  now  mostly  raised  on  low  lands 
and  reclaimed  marshes,  the  yield  being  more  than  double  that  formerly  obtained 
from  high  lands. 

There  are  no  unoccupied  lands  in  the  county.  Farm  lands  are  worth  from  $20  to 
$100  per  acre,  according  to  quality,  location  and  improvements.  The  public  roads 
are  generally  good. 

The  county  is  traversed  by  two  east  and  west  railroads,  and  by  three  north  and 
south  railroads.  Every  township  in  the  county,  except  two,  has  a  railroad  station  in 
it,  and  those  townships  have  railroad  stations  within  a  mile  of  their  line.  All  parts 
of  the  county  are  convenient  to  market.  Excellent  schools  are  sustained  throughout 
the  county.  Great  interest  is  taken  in  educational  matters.  In  all  the  villages  are 
elegant  and  commodious  school  buildings. 

There  are  a  number  of  tine  inland  lakes,  which  have  become  places  of  pleasant 
summer  resort  for  the  people  of  the  villages. 

The  county  borders  on  Indiana,  is  the  third  county  east  from  Lake  Michigan,  has 
an  area  of  504  square  miles,  and  in  1890  had  a  population  of  25,356.  Centreville  is  the 
county  seat — population,  775. 

TUSCOLA  COUNTY. 

BY    JOHN    H.    BURGESS,    VASSAR,    MICH. 

Tuscola  county  was  organized  in  the  year  1850.  It  embraces  the  following 
townships:  10,  11,  12,  13  and  14  north  of  range  7,  8.  9, 10  and  11  east,  and  fractional 
township  15  north  of  range  8  east.  The  county  is  bounded  on  the  north  by 
Saginaw  bay  and  a  portion  of  Huron  county,  on  the  east  by  Sanilac  county, 
on  the  south  by  Genesee  and  Lapeer  counties,  on  the  west  by  Saginaw  and  Bay 
counties.  The  land  in  townships  in  range  7,  and  towns  13,  14  and  fractional  15  north 
of  range  8  east  are  quite  level,  though  having  suflBcient  decent  towards  the  Saginaw 
bay  to  give  fine  drainage  to  a  large  part  of  it,  in  fact  to  a  large  proportion  of  the 
county. 

Its  principal  stream  is  the  Cass  river,  which  runs  through  the  county  from 
the  northwest  to  the  southwest  dividing  the  county  into  nearly  equal  parts,  thus 
affording  good   drainage   and   available   water  power   along  its   entire    course. 

The  soil  is  rich  and  in  great  variety,  with  clay  loam  surface  and  a  stronger 
clay  subsoil,  and  here  and  there  drifts  or  patches  of  sandy  loam  or  sand  and 
gravel.  The  eastern  portion  of  the  county  is  more  rolling  with  more  gravel  and 
less  clay.  Its  timber  consists  of  beech,  hard  and  soft  maple,  white  and  black 
ash,   elm,  oak,   basswood,   hickory,   hemlock   and   cedar. 

There  are  five  State  roads  in  the  county  and  these,  with  the  local  highways, 
are  kept  in  good  condition.  The  Detroit  &amp;  Bay  City  division  of  the  Michigan 
Central  Railroad,  with  its  Caro  and  East  Saginaw  branches,  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere 
Marquette  and  its  Watertown  extension,  the  East  Saginaw,  Tuscola  &amp;  Huron, 
the   Pontiac,  Oxford   &amp;  Northern   railroads  traverse   the   county. 

Lands  can  be  had  at  prices  ranging  from  $5  to  $10  for  "stump"  lands.  Good 
unimproved   agricultural   lands   range   in   prices  from  $10   to  $20   per   acre. 

A  good  supply  of  pure  water  is  found  in  all  parts  of  the  county.  In  many 
localities  tiowing  wells  are  obtained  by  drilling.    The  county  is  generally  healthy. 

Tuscola  county  can  boast  of  soils  that  produce  in  abundance  all  the  staple 
grains  and  root  crops,  such  as  are  suitable  to  this  latitude.  Fruits,  such  as 
apples,  pears,  plums,  cherries,  and  in  some  localities  in  the  county,  peaches  do 
well.  Small  fruits  yield  in  abundance  and  find  a  ready  sale  in  the  markets  of 
the  Saginaw   valley,  Detroit   and   Port  Huron. 

There  are  a  number  of  flourishing  villages  in  the  county,  among  which  is  Caro, 
the  county  seat.  It  is  located  near  the  center  of  the  county.  Its  push  and 
enterprise  are  proverbial.  It  boasts  of  electric  lights  and  water  works.  It  is 
also  the  terminus  of  the  Caro  branch  of  the  Michigan  Central  Railroad.  Vassar 
is  the  metropolitan  village  of  the  county.  Its  location  makes  it,  so  to_  speak, 
the  gateway  of  traffic  and  travel  to  and  from  the  county.  At  this  point  the 
Michigan  Central  crosses  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette  Railroad,  forming  a  junction 
for  traffic  to  Detroit,  Bay  City.  Saginaw,  Port  Huron,  also  the  Caro  branch  of 
the  Michigan  Central  Railroad.  Vassar  justly  prides  itself  on  the  fact  of  having 
pure  drinking  water  from  flowing  artesian  wells,  as  supplied  by  its  water  works. 
It   has  modern   electric   lights,   several    manufactories,    and    is  the  central   market 


280  Michigan  and  its  Kesources. 

of  the  county.  Mayville  is  a  growing  village  of  the  county,  situated  in  a  splen- 
did agricultural  district,  it  keeps  pace  with  the  movement  "forward."  Millington, 
Cass  City,  Unionville,  Pair  Grove,  and  a  number  of  other  towns  and  villages, 
are   all   steadily   pushing  to   the  front. 

With  splendid  transportation  facilities,  good  highways,  fine  agricultural  lands, 
with  a  soil  that  yields  bountifully  in  the  grains  and  root  crops,  as  well  as 
fruits,  with  good  markets,  accessible  at  all  seasons  of  the  year,  backed  up  with 
a  good  climate,  partially  free  from  "  cyclones "  and  heavy  paralyzing  storms,  pure 
water,  thriving  village  and  farming  regions,  first  class  schools,  and  thorough- 
going enterprise  among  its  inhabitants,  Tuscola  county  offers  to  the  seekers 
after  homes,  to  the  manufacturers  in  search  of  openings,  inducements  not  to  be 
overlooked.    In  1890  the  population    was  32,508. 


WAYNE  COUNTY. 

BY    A.    A.     BOUTELL. 

Wayne  county  was  organized  in  1796,  nine  years  before  the  territory  of  Michigan 
was  established,  and  but  a  few  weeks  after  the  surrender  of  the  garrison  at  Detroit 
by  the  British.  It  was  named  after  Gen.  Anthony  Wayne,  at  that  time  the  most 
popular  man  in  the  northwest,  owing  to  his  great  victory  over  the  savages. 

This  county  was  at  first  large,  comprising  a  considerable  part  of  Ohio,  Indiana 
and  Illinois,  as  well  as  the  whole  of  the  State  of  Michigan.  At  present  it  occupies 
a  very  important  position  near  the  southeast  corner  of  the  state  and  contains  about 
666  square  miles. 

The  land  formerly  somewhat  low  and  swampy,  has  been  nearly  all  reclaimed,  so 
that  some  of  the  best  farming  land  in  the  state  is  now  in  this  county,  the  market 
gardens  in  and  about  Detroit  being  wonderfully  productive.  The  large  and  increas- 
ing demand  for  fruit  and  vegetables  at  Detroit  makes  farming  very  profitable,  and 
dairymen  thrive  with  the  good  pasturage  afforded,  and  the  ready  sale  of  milk  and 
butter. 

But  the  most  profitable  thing  for  farmers  has  been  the  great  increase  in  the 
value  of  their  land,  especially  within  a  radius  of  seven  or  eight  miles  of  the  city  of 
Detroit. 

While  the  city  of  Detroit  comprises  only  twenty-nine  square  miles  within  its  cor- 
porate limits,  yet  its  suburbs  extend  over  many  additional  square  miles  of  territory. 

From  Grosse  Pointe  six  miles  above  the  city  limits  on  the  north,  to  Wyandotte 
eight  miles  below  the  city  on  the  south,  out  Woodward  avenve  from  the  center  of 
the  city  north  to  the  county  line,  and  west  ten  miles  to  Dearborn,  the  land  i&amp; 
either  already  platted  or  held  and  sold  as  acerage  for  future  platting  into  lots. 

The  farmers  through  all  this  extent  of  territory  have  been  greatly  benefited  by 
the  rise  in  values  and  many  of  them  are  enabled  to  retire  with  a  competence  for 
their  old  age  from  the  sale  of  small  farms. 

This  suburban  territory  will  continue  to  extend  and  widen  as  electric  roads  and 
rapid  transit  make  it  possible  to  reach  points  ten  or  even  twenty  miles  from  the 
city  hall  in  a  few  minutes,  and  the  very  rapid  increase  in  the  population  of  the 
city  makes  homes  in  the  suburbs  in  great  demand, 

Wayne  county  is  bounded  on  the  east  by  Lake  St.  Clair  and  the  Detroit  river. 
This  river  flows  majestically  through  a  wide  and  deep  channel,  its  water,  pure 
and  limpid,  floats  on  its  ample  bosom  more  vessels  and  a  greater  tonnage 
than  any  other  river  in  the  world.  The  facilities  for  transportation  of  products 
and  passengers  during  the  season  of  navigation  are  unexcelled  and  the  low 
freight  rates  and  cheap  fares  on  vessels  plying  up  and  down  this  beautiful  river 
at   all  hours  of  the   day  and  night,   are  appreciated  and  enjoyed  by   many. 

The  railroad  facilities  are  also  good.  Detroit,  the  entrepot,  as  well  as  metrop- 
olis of  the  state  and  county,  is  an  important  station  on  three  of  the  most 
prominent  trans-continental  lines,  the  Michigan  Central,  Grand  Trunk  and  Canadian 
Pacific,  while  the  Wabash  and  Lake  Shore  &amp;  Michigan  Southern  tap  the  great 
west  and  southwest,  and  the  Detroit,  Lansing  &amp;  Northern,  the  Detroit,  Grand 
Haven  &amp;  Milwaukee,  the  Flint  &amp;  Pere  Marquette,  and  the  Detroit  &amp;  Bay  City 
make  direct   connection  with   the   various  portions  of   the   State. 

The  climate  of  Wayne  county  is  healthy  and  salubrious,  and  its  water  supply 
pure  and  inexhaustible.    The  supply  for  Detroit  is    obtained  from  Detroit  river, 


Michigan  by   Counties.  281 

fed  by  the  great  lakes  above,  and  is  acknowledged  to  be  the  best  obtained  by 
any  large  city  in  the  world,  while  good  water  is  supplied  by  wells  through  the 
farming   districts. 

The  city  has  a  well  developed  sewage  system,  and  is  thoroughly  drained.  The  farm- 
ing lands  are  also  well  drained,  with  broad,  deep  ditches,  emptying  into  the  Detroit 
river  on  the  east,  into  Connor's  creek  in  the  northern  portion.  River  Rouge  in  the  cen- 
tral and  Huron  river  in  the  southern.  Farming  lands  outside  the  radius  affected  by 
the  proximity  of  Detroit,  can  be  purchased  for  from  S40  to  SlOO  per  acre,  and,  on 
account  of  the  nearness  of  excellent  markets  and  the  continued  increase  of  values  as 
suburban  lines  of  electric  cars  penetrate  farther  and  farther  into  the  interior  of  the 
county,  affords  opportunity  for  solid  investments.  While  the  soil  of  Wayne  county  is 
particularly  adapted  to  the  raising  of  hay  and  grazing,  yet  all  kinds  of  cereals  are 
grown  with  profit  and  advantage.  It  is  computed  that  10,208  horses  are  kept  in  the 
city  of  Detroit  and  the  lai'ge  amount  of  manure  produced  is  carted  out  upon  the  lands 
in  the  vicinity,  which,  with  the  great  number  of  dairy  farms,  adds  richness  to  the  soil 
and  increases  its  great  productiveness.  Farmers  in  Wayne  county  are  not  unlike  those 
in  other  of  the  older  settled  counties,  always  ready  to  move  on,  and  land  can  always  be 
bought  to  advantage  with  almost  absolute  security  of  profit.  Wayne  county  enjoys 
unequaled  facilities  for  manufacturing.  Its  geographical  position  is  unexcelled.  Sit- 
uated midway  on  the  chain  of  great  inland  lakes,  and  with  a  frontage  on  the  westerly 
side  of  the  entire  length  of  Detroit  river  or  strait,  its  manufactured  products  can  be 
carried  cheaply  to  all  parts  of  this  immense  territory.  The  raw  material  also,  iron  and 
copper  ore  from  Michigan's  great  mines  in  the  upper  peninsula,  lumber  from  the  vast 
forests  of  Michigan  and  Ontario,  are  freighted  here  by  immense  boats  at  a  very  low 
price,  and  coal  is  brought  up  from  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania  as  return  cargoes,  at  a  nom- 
inal rate.  The  great  railroad  systems  furnish  rapid  and  economical  transportation  for 
manufactured  goods  to  all  parts  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  The  manufactur- 
ing interests  of  Detroit  alone  are  very  large  and  constantly  growing.  We  have  here 
the  largest  seed  house  in  the  world,  the  largest  stove  foundries  in  the  world,  the 
greatest  freight  and  passenger  car  factories  in  the  world,  the  largest  manufacturing 
chemists  in  the  world,  while  its  tobacco  factories,  electrical  supplies,  etc.,  etc.  compete 
with  the  world  in  extent  of  product  and  excellence. 

The  secretary  of  the  Detroit  Real  Estate  Board,  from  a  personal  canvass,  which  is 
reliable,  states:  "The  seven  hundred  manufacturing  institutions  canvassed  employ 
in  the  aggregate  32,750  males  and  8,000  female  operatives,  or  a  total  of  40,750.  To  this 
army  of  employes  is  paid  each  month  $1,541,700.  or  the  enormous  sum  of  $18,1500,000 
annually.  The  product  in  1891  amounted  to  §86,500,000  and  the  invested  capital  to 
$52,500,000." 

Outside  of  Detroit  manufacturing  is  also  extensively  carried  on  in  this  county.  This 
is  particularly  true  of  Delray,  the  River  Rouge  district,  and  Wyandotte  on  the  south. 
Added  two  very  favorable  locations  on  both  rail  and  water  routes,  cheap  taxation, 
cheap  water  and  fuel,  there  are  many  inducements  offered  by  owners  of  vacant  lands. 
The  thriving  villages  of  Plymouth,  Northville,  Wayne.  Dearborn,  Norris  and  Romulus, 
in  the  interior  of  the  county,  are  competing  for  manufacturing  plants  and  many  are 
already  established,  producing  finished  work  of  great  excellence.  Any  account  of 
Wayne  county  would  be  incomplete  without  some  reference  to  the  beautiful  islands  in 
the  Detroit  river,  which  are  comprised  within  its  limits.  The  largest  of  these  are  Grosse 
Isle  in  the  south  and  Belle  Isle  in  the  north. 

Grosse  Isle  is  beautifully  situated  on  the  American  side  of  the  main  channel  of  the 
Detroit  river,  and  is  about  seven  and  one-half  miles  in  extreme  length,  with  an  average 
breadth  of  one  and  one-half  miles,  and  contains  about  ten  square  miles  or  6,400  acres. 
The  river  below  the  island  is  some  four  miles  wide,  opening  out  into  Lake  Erie  six 
miles  away.  The  cooling  breezes  of  lake  and  river,  together  with  its  arable  soil  and 
the  vernal  shade  of  the  native  trees,  make  this  an  ideal  spot  for  summer  homes.  Many 
of  the  substantial  men  of  Detroit  spend  their  summers  here. 

Belle  Isle,  just  above  Detroit  and  extending  northward  to  Lake  St.  Clair,  is  a  httle 
over  two  miles  long  and  contains  673.98  acres.  The  entire  island,  with  the  exception 
of  about  six  acres  in  the  northeast  corner,  which  belongs  to  the  United  States  and  is 
set  apart  for  the  light  house  which  guards  the  entrance  to  the  main  channel  of  the 
Detroit  river,  is  owned  by  the  city  of  Detroit,  making  one  of  the  most  beautiful  parks 
in  the  world.  The  island  is  flat  and  but  little  above  the  surface  of  the  river.  Most  of 
it  is  shaded  by  native  trees,  and  the  plan  of  ornamentation  adopted  by  the  park  board, 
with  the  advice  and  assistance  of  one  of  our  most  eminent  landscape  engineers,  has 
been  to  utilize  these  trees  to  the  utmost  extent,  quite  large  portions  of  the  island 
being  left   in    its    natural   state,    with    carriage    roads,   canals   and   foot    paths   cut

through  The  low  lying  grounds  and  marshes  have  been  reclaimed  by  cutting  out 
inland  lakes  connected  by  canals  to  the  river,  above,  below  and  on  either  side.  Splen- 
did roads  have  been  built,  and  suitable  buildings,  while  acres  of  flowers  are  kept 
blooming  every  year.  The  island  is  connected  with  the  main  land  by  an  iron  bridge 
about  live-eights  of  a  mile  long,  and  numerous  palatial  boats  make  frequent  trips  from 
various  points  of  the  city  during  the  warm  weather  As  many  as  50,000  people  have 
visited  this  island  park  in  a  single  day. 

DETROIT. 


The  above  meagre  sketch  of  Wayne  county  has  only  mentioned  the  city  of  Detroit 
incidentally,  but  any  compilation  of  Michigan  and  Its  Resources  should  have  some  par- 
ticular account  of  its  metropolis.  Those  who  may  contemplate  a  change  from  homes 
in  foreign  climes,  or  from  the  more  thickly  populated  states  in  the  east,  will  do  well  to 
investigate  the  inducements  offered  by  Michigan  for  their  future  home.  And  if  they 
enter  this  great  State  in  furtherance  of  their  quest,  they  will  quite  naturally  do 
so  through  the  portal  at  Detroit.  If  first  impressions  of  a  new  country  are  worth 
anything,  then  their  first  sight  of  Detroit  from  its  noble  river,  their  rides  through  broad 
streets  to  palatial  hotels,  the  appearance  of  its  mammoth  stores  whose  windows  show 
samples  of  the  wealth  of  goods  within,  must  make  this  impression  favorable.  A  few 
days  spent  in  a  careful  survey  of  the  city  will  increase  these  impressions.  First  take  a 
ride  from  the  center  of  the  city  over  the  splendidly  equipped  electric  roads  which 
traverse  broad  avenues  fringed  with  the  elegant  homes  of  its  solid  citizens,  embowered 


Michigan  by  Counties.  281- 


in  umbrageous  trees  and  with  well  kept  lawns,  to  the  termini  in  either  direction.  Then 
walk  or  ride  through  street  after  street  of  comfortable  homes  of  merchants,  artisans 
and  mechanics,  biven  laborers  here  own  their  own  little  homes,  which,  as  a  rule,  are 
trimly  kept,  while  fruit,  vines,  and  flowers  abound  Detroit  has  been  well  called 
the  "city  of  homes,"  and  very  few  cities  in  this  or  any  other  land,  according  to  their 
population,  have  so  many  houses  occupied  by  their  owners.  You  can  take  a  seat  in  a 
comfortable  electric  car,  and  for  ten  cents  ride  in  a  northerly  direction,  near  the  river 
banks,  to  the  picturesquely  beautiful  village  of  Grosse  Pointe  Farms,  upon  the  placid 
shores  of  Lake  St.  Clair.  Here  magnificent  summer  cottages  on  wide  extended  lawns, 
shelter,  during  the  summer  months,  Detroit's  most  substantial  citizens. 

Boat  houses  dot  the  lake  front  and  palatial  steam  yachts  make  daily  trips  to  the 
city.  For  the  same  sum,  ten  cents,  you  can  be  whirled  by  electricity  along  the  river 
banks  to  Wyandotte,  twenty  miles  to  the  south.  Or  take  the  Woodward  avenue  line 
and  ride  out  to  Highland  Park  and  Senator  Palmer's  famous  Log  Cabin  farm,  to  the 
north. 

For  ten  cents  you  can  make  the  round  trip  from  the  city  to  Belle  Isle  Park  above, 
to  Des-chree  shos-ka  below,  or  ride  for  half  a  day  on  boats  fitted  with  every  conven- 
ience for  safety  and  comfort.  During  the  warm  days  of  summer  tired  men  and 
women  and  countless  children  are  revived,  benefited  and  made  strong  and  healthy 
by  these  cheap  water  excursions.  For  fifty  cents  you  can  take  the  round  trip  by 
boat  up  the  river,  across  Lake  St.  Clair  to  the  Flats,  the  American  Venice,  and 
there  at  hotel  or  private  club,  paitake  of  an  elegant  fish  supper  foj-  fifty  cents 
more,  and  ride  home  again  by  moonlight.  For  one  dollar  this  trip  can  be  extended 
to  Port  Huron  at  the  foot  of  Lake  Huron,  sixty  miles  away. 

Boats  also  ply  daily  down  the  river  to  way  ports,  to  Toledo,  Sandusky  and  the 
famous  islands  of  Putin-Bay.  Every  night  large  and  beautiful  boats  leave  for  Cleve- 
land, and  four  times  each  week  up  the  river  to  Mackinaw  Island  and  the  summer 
resorts  to  the  north. 

In  the  city  itself,  if  inclined  to  read,  you  can  visit  our  large  and  commodious 
public  library  building  with  its  108,720  volumes  of  excellently  selected  works,  treat- 
ing on  all  subjects. 

Detroit  is  also  gaining  a  reputation  as  a  convention  city.  And  those  who  visit 
the  city  on  these  occasions  never  fail  to  carry  away  pleasant  recollections  of  their 
cordial  welcome  and  handsome  treatment,  and  of  the  countless  attractions  of  the 
beautiful  city  of  the  straits.  Those  who  live  in  the  malarial  districts  of  the  south, 
after  once  tasting  the  delights  of  a  summer  at  Detroit,  always  come  again  and  bring 
their  friends. 

Detroit  is  an  old  city,  having  been  first  visited  by  the  French  in  1610,  two  years 
after  the  founding  of  Quebec.  The  first  fort  was  built  here  in  1701.  It  has  always 
had  the  reputation  of  being  a  solid  but  conservative  city,  and  has  never  been 
affected  by  booms  or  very  seriously  by  depressions.  While  progress  has  been  slow 
yet  is  has  always  been  sure,  with  no  steps  backward.  Its  favorable  location  has 
made  for  it  a  large  and  substantial  city  in  spite  of  its  conservatism,  and  now  its 
progress  is  marked  by  the  enterprise  of  its  younger  men.  New  buildings  and  new 
enterprises  are  rapidly  succeeding  each  other,  and  a  few  years  more  will  transform 
its  business  streets  with  new  and  modern  buildings.  Among  the  new  buildings 
now  under  way  are  the  new  postoffice.  occupying  an  entire  square  upon  Fort  street  and 
Lafayette  avenue,  the  Masonic  Temple,  the  Home  Savings  building,  the  Union 
Trust  building,  and  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  building.  The  two  latter  are  to  be 
modern  in  every  respect,  twelve  or  thirteen  stories  high,  made  of  structural  steel, 
fire  proof  and  with  every  known  convenience  for  their  hundreds  of  tenents. 

The  city  government  is  well  administered,  with  a  most  energetic  mayor  at  its 
head,  and  commercial  matters  are  looked  after  by  several  important  exchanges. 
The  Board  of  Trade  was  organized  in  1856.  It  is  a  strong  organization,  capable  of 
handling  the  immense  cereal  products  of  the  State,  which  here  find  their  natural 
market. 

The  Merchants  and  Manufacturers'  Exchange  was  founded  in  1878  and  has 
done  efficient  work  ever  since.  Its  information  and  collection  departments  are  of 
very  great  assistance  to  its  members.  The  Detroit  Real  Estate  Board  was  more 
recently  organized.  Its  members  are  mostly  young  men  and  a  great  impetus 
has  been  given  to  real  estate  matters  since  it  was  organized.  Equitable  arrange- 
ments are  made  among  themselves  for  dividing  commissions  on  listed  property 
and  anything  savoring  of  sharp  practices  are  severely  frowned  upon.  The  Detroit 
Builders'  Exchange  was  also  recently  formed  and  has  done  good  work  in  regu- 
lating building  operations.  The  Detroit  Clearing  House  has  supervision  of  the 
clearances  of   the   seventeen   State   and  eight    national    banks    in    Detroit,    whose 


284  MiCHlGAiN     AlsD    ITS    EeSOURCES. 

combined  capital  amounts  to  88.300.000  with  a  surplus  and  undivided  profits  of 
82,927.414,   a  .d   total   deposits  of  858.387.225. 

The  Det)()it  Chamber  of  Commerce  was  organized  in  1^1  and  has  a  member- 
ship of  nearly  seven  hundred  of  the  city's  I. est  and  most  procrressive  business 
and  profePBional  men.  It  includes  in  its  membership  the  larger  number  of  those 
in  the  other  exchanges  and  its  new  building,  a  cut  of  which  is  given  elsewhei-e, 
is  expected  to  become  the  home  of  the  other  exchanges,  so  that  all  can  unite 
in   developing   the   interests   of   the   city. 

Its  object,  as  set  forth  in  its  bylaws,  reads:  "It  shall  have  for  'its  object 
the  advancement  of  the  public  interests  of  the  city  of  Detroit,  the  development 
of  all  legitimate  enterprises  tending  to  increase  its  prosperity,  the  uniting  of 
the  energies  and  influence  of  its  citizens  upon  all  subjects  at^ecting  the  welfare 
of  the  city,  the  improvement  of  facilities  for  transportation,  the  diflfusion  of 
information  concerning  the  manufactures,  trade  and  business  of  the  city  and  the 
State,  the  cultivation  of  friendly  relations  and  the  promotion  of  equitable  prin- 
ciples  among   the  business   men   of   Detroit   and   vicinity." 

To  sum  up,  Detroit  and  Wayne  county  afford  many  opportunities  for  the 
investment  of  money  and  enterprise.  Farmers,  merchants  mechanics,  manufact- 
urers and  capitalists  can  here  tind  comfortable  homes  and  unexcelled  chances 
for  the  profitable  investment  of  money.  Any  inquiries  directed  to  the  secretary 
of  The   Detroit   Chamber   of   Commerce  will   have   prompt  attention. 


WEXFORD   COUNTY. 

Wexford  county  was  organized  in  the  year  1869.  The  population  at  present  is 
estimated  at  13,000.  The  surface  of  the  county  is  diversified,  varying  from  gently 
rolling  to  hilly  ranges  entending  east  and  west  through  the  center  of  the  county. 
This  range  is  the  divide  between  the  Manistee  river  on  the  north  and  the  basin  of 
the  Clam  lakes  and  Clam  river  on  the  south.  It  is  decidedly  an  agricultural  county, 
the  soil  is  very  productive  when  properly  cultivated.  The  prevailing  soil  is  a  sandy 
loam,  although  a  rich  clay  soil  is  found  in  luany  places.  All  of  the  cereal  products 
are  grown  successfully.  Potatoes  are  one  of  the  principal  crops  and  attain  to  a 
great  degree  of  perfection,  command  good  prices,  and  are  largely  shipped  to  the 
southern  markets  and  to  the  east  and  west.  Six  hundred  thousand  bushels  of  pota- 
toes were  shipped  from  this  county  last  season  by  one  Cadillac  dealer,  Wexford 
county  is  also  gaining  a  reputation  as  a  fruit  growing  county.  Apples,  pears  and 
plums  are  grown  to  perfection.  Peaches  are  grown  in  favorable  localities,  while 
berries  and  small  fruits  are  grown  in  abundance.  Wexford  county  was  awarded 
first  premium  on  fruit  exhibits  at  the  West  Michigan  Fair  in  1892. 

The  hardwood  timber  is  a  great  source  of  wealth  to  the  county  and  affords  rare 
opportunity  for  the  investment  of  capital  in  its  manufacture.  The  quality  of  its 
hardwood  is  excelled  nowhere  and  its  quantity  is  immense.  There  is  a  good  system 
of  schools,  and  good  school  houses  sufficient  for  all  requirements.  There  is  also  a 
good  system  of  roads. 

Not  the  least  attractive  are  the  numerous  streams  of  pure  spring  water  which 
abound  in  speckled  trout.  The  climate  is  one  of  the  most  healthful  in  the  world. 
The  spring  season  and  plowing  commence  from  the  10th  to  the  15th  of  April. 

Two  lines  of  railroad  extend  through  the  county,  the  Grand  Rapids  &amp;  Indiana, 
running  north  and  south,  T.,  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  Railroad  running  northwest  by 
southeast,  afford  excellent  shipping  facilities  for  the  large  amount  of  timber, 
cedar  posts,  and  telegraph  poles  produced  in  the  county,  and  also  for  shipping 
farm  products  which  are  produced  largely  in  excess  of  home  demand.  Thriving 
towns  are  building  on  these  lines. 

The  city  of  Cadillac,  located  on  the  east  shore  of  Little  Clam  lake,  at  the  cross- 
ing of  the  T.,  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  and  G.  R.  &amp;  I.  railroads,  was  founded  in  1870  and 
has  now  a  population  of  6,000.  Little  Clam  lake  is  a  beautiful  sheet  of  pure  water 
three  miles  long  by  one  wide,  is  well  stocked  with  pike,  pickerel  and  perch,  and 
affords  excellent  fishing.  Its  waters  are  traversed  by  pleasure  steamers  and  it  is 
destined  to  become  a  famous  pleasure  resort.  For  a  new  city  in  a  new  country 
Cadillac  is  excelled  nowhere  and  the  energy  and  enterprise  of  the  people  is 
unbounded.  Manton,  the  second  town  in  the  county,  on  the  line  of  the  G.  R.  &amp;  I. 
railroad,  is  a  village  of  about  800  inhabitants.  It  is  a  flourishing  town  and  a  lively 
shipping  point  for  the  products    of    the  county.    Boon,  Harriette  and  Sherman  are 


Michigan  by  Counties.  285 

thriving  villages  on  the  line  of  the  T.  A.  A.  &amp;  N.  M.  R.  R.  Great  inducements 
are  offered  to  settlers.  There  is  an  increasing  den)and  for  hardwood  timber  of  which 
Wexford  county  has  an  abundant  supply  of  the  best  quality,  the  proceeds  of  which 
will  defray  all  expenses  of  clearing  the  wild  lands  ready  for  the  plow.  No  county 
offers  greater  inducements  to  the  energetic  man  with,  small  means  to  make  a  home. 
On  January  1,  189.3.  there  were  17.700  acres  of  government  and  State  land  subject 
to  sale  or  entry  in  the  county,  but  the  amount  is  constantly  being  reduced.
