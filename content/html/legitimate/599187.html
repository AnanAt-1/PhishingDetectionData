            of the "hottest" trends
            in the 1970s was the development and utilization of learning centers.
            While their use never disappeared or became extinct, the emphasis
            placed upon them for improving a teacher's ability to individualize
            classroom instruction became greatly diminished. The educational
            pendulum has swung back to individualizing many aspects of educational
            programs for children, especially with mandated inclusive education.
            Evidence of this resurgence is easily visible in conceptual schema
            and philosophies embedded in whole language, invented spelling, individualized
            spelling, and early childhood programs.  </font>            <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To
                read underlying learning principles, or theory, about centers
                is quite different from designing, constructing, and using centers
                on the 'firing line." Hence, this brief expose
                  is meant to help teachers who lack information, experiences,
                  and/or models to cross the chasm between theory and practice
                  (a good journal exists by the name of Theory Into Practice).
                  Remember, learning centers have infiltrated the educational
                  landscape for the last 28 years. Research has demonstrated
                  that they are a very effective learning strategy. To date,
                  this writer has not found negative research regarding learning
                  centers, although they do have some downsides or misuses. </font><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A
            learning center is a place where children can work on one or more
            instructional activities independently, thereby providing a teacher
            with a mechanism for individualizing his/her program. The activities
            are designed to develop and/or reinforce concepts, skills, and interests. </font>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P><font size="2"> Each
                    group of activities in a learning center is associated with
                    a specific theme, and each activity in a center constitutes
                    a learning station. Therefore, a learning station is a component
                    of the learning center. Some teachers use these terms interchangeably. </font>              
            <P><font size="2">However, it is possible,
                  and sometimes desirable, to have one learning station constitute
                  an entire learning center. It really becomes a organizational
                  philosophy as to how one arranges his/her classroom. Also,
                  centers have specific purposes as to whether they are more
                  academic or more interest-oriented. For instance, the younger
                  child is developmentally not able to spend longer periods of
                  time working at one center. Therefore, the classroom for younger
                  elementary children would contain more learning centers with
                  fewer stations whereas the classroom in the intermediate grades
                  would comprise of fewer centers and more stations (activities)
                  within the center. <BR>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Although
            learning centers have been demonstrated by many teachers to be effective
            teaching and learning devices, they can unquestionably cause "migraine" headaches.
            Although they are based upon solid learning principles, they do not
            always work well. If this is the case, there usually is a reason
            for it. Here are common problem areas. </font></font>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Many
                    new teachers assume children know how to work independently.
                            This is not usually standard operating procedure
                    for them. If your children have not received much exposure
                    to this approach, you will need to teach them how to work
                    independently in and with centers. Remember, one major thrust
                    of learning centers is to increase a child's sense of responsibility.             </font></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Another
                    frequent reason why centers receive a "bad rap" is
                            that the activities housed within the center are too difficult
                            for the children. If children are expected to work on their own,
                            centers need to be easy enough for the child's independent level
                            of functioning - not the more elevated instructional level that
                            requires the teacher's presence, nor the frustration level that
                            is tantamount to failure.&nbsp; If you find children
                            having difficulty with reinforcement centers, it
                            can indicate that the concepts/skills were not adequately
                            learned. If this is true, you <BR>
                          can use the center diagnostically to determine whether
                          they are ready for the center and whether you need to
                          reteach some concepts/skills.
              </font></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Centers
                    can contain too many concepts, thereby befuddling some children
                    with cognitive overload. For instance, a map reading center
                    that incorporates information on cardinal/intermediate directions,
                    legend, scale, latitude and longitude would be too comprehensive.
                    It would be more advisable and effective to develop centers
                    based upon each concept cluster.&nbsp; Less
                        mature children will need to be guided through simple
                    centers. When they are ready to handle more complex centers,
                    they can be directed to them.             </font></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Not
                    all topics are conducive to the learning center mode of instruction.&nbsp; Employing
                    other strategies such as simulation, KWL, DLTA, etc. may
                    be more effective. Centers are not the only teaching strategy
                    on the market.             </font></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Sometimes an ineffective design format and/or inappropriate
                            location can lead to the center's problems. For instance,
                  a puppet center may not be in a private enough location.
              </font></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> If
                    you are a novice at incorporating learning centers into your
                    classroom, but have a fervent desire to do so, proceed with
                    moderation. Some new teachers embrace the philosophy too
                    vigorously and discover they are in "over their heads." The
                          ensuing chaos is not necessarily the fault of your
                    students or of the center approach.             </font></font></li>
              <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, and probably most importantly, centers can fail because
                    some teachers simply lack commitment. If teachers do not wish
                    to use centers, they would be far happier and effective using
                    other methods. <BR>
