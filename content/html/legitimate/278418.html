						<p><a name="PANTHER">A </a><a href="firewirebug.html">serious bug</a>
 (links to mirror of User Contributed FAQ on the bug) introduced by Mac 
OS X 10.3 (Panther's) more narrow definition of Firewire specs, requires
 specific firmware updates be given to Firewire drives before using with
 Panther or Apple's new Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) operating system. In 
addition it is recommended these drives not be connected during the 
software installation update. A new section on this FAQ discusses <a href="#TIGER">Tiger slowdowns</a>.</p>

						<hr>
						<h2>Caution Note</h2>

						<p>If unsure as to which of these causes is slowing down your 
machine, ask a technician to help you isolate it before attempting to 
use any software to fix the issue. Many of the softwares recommended 
below have multipurpose functions, which may do other things you don't 
want to do to your system. Only use the software to solve the known 
issue you are having. This is the most important thing to remember. 
Optimization tools are not to be used lightly, and definitely not 
without a <a href="backup.html">backup</a> already present. You can 
seriously damage your Mac's software integrity if you use these tools 
indiscriminately. Of all the least harmless tools you can use are those 
which manage your logfile cleanup which happens on a daily, weekly, and 
monthly basis when your machine is left on overnight. You can force this
 logfile cleanup to happen on your spare time with the <a href="software.html#PERIODICLOG">Periodic Logfile Cleanup</a>
 Applescript. Other utilities listed below involved with .ds_store, 
cache, prebinding, permissions (except Apple's Disk Utility), are to 
only be used for troubleshooting, and not maintenance.</p>
						A handy utility in isolating software slowdowns, is <a href="http://etrecheck.com">Etrecheck</a>.
 Items in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ it mentions may be the cause of
 your slowing down, and items in Login Items it mentions may be causing 
the slowing down as well. Inquire either on <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/">AppleCare</a>, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/">Apple Support Communities</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/usergroups">local usergroup</a>, or my <a href="techsupport.html">Technical Support service</a>
 if there is a known item reported by Etrecheck that would be slowing 
you down. Many of these items are described on this tip. Do not install 
any system cache removal utilities without first <a href="backup.html">backing up</a>
 your data at least twice to two separate locations. A good overview of 
Malware that includes those that masquerade as speed optimizers, is on <a href="https://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/computer/worst-mac-virus-malware.htm" target="_top">Vaughn's website of Worst Mac Virus Malware</a>.

						<a name="FIRMWARE">1.</a> The wrong firmware may yield unpredictable results, check these <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT1395">updates for PowerPC</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518">Intel Macs</a>
 to see if your firmware needs updating. Many iMacs and iBooks that have
 not had their firmware updated ended up with a non-working video chip 
causing the internal display to go dead, and if there is no external 
display port on your particular machine, a motherboard replacement is 
necessary to get video back. All DV iMacs and dual-USB iBooks have an 
external display port. Older iBooks and iMacs do not. This <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT2568">article</a>
 will tell you where to find your firmware version. Note, if your 
computer has not yet installed Mac OS 9 first, you'll need to apply for 
the update program by calling the promotion center at (800) 785-9445. 
Per Apple Discussions moderator info, you may still apply and get the 
CD, and then install it using these <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA43881">instructions</a> Please <a href="FM.html" target="_top">sign guestbook</a> if you find otherwise.<br>

						<br>
						<a name="HARDDISK">3.</a> Hard disk space and <a href="#BACKUP">backups</a>
 - Mac OS X 10.2 installs in about 1.9 GB of space and Mac OS X 10.4, 
with a minimum of about 5 GB of free disk space. For best speed, it is 
recommended that after installation of X, you have at least 1 GB + your 
physical RAM that is installed in free hard disk space, even more ideal,
 the arbitrary amount of about 15% hard disk space full has been found 
to be optimal for Mac OS X. There is no real documented reason for this 
to be the case, but most experts believe it helps. To learn how to free 
up more disk space after backing up your data, see my FAQ <a href="diskfull.html">How to free up my disk space?</a>.
 So if you have 640 MB of RAM, you should have at least 3.5 GB of free 
hard disk space before installing Jaguar or Panther. It is also 
recommended you use an external Oxford 911 firewire hard disk to backup 
your data prior to installing any updates. This makes it difficult for 
those without Firewire. An upgrade was available from <a href="http://www.sonnettech.com/">Sonnet</a>
 called the Harmony G3 that offered Firewire to some iMacs that don't 
have Firewire. For those Powerbooks and Powermacs with built-in SCSI, 
Mac OS X does recognize the built-in SCSI port, but not necessarily all 
SCSI cards. Thus if you have SCSI on the motherboard you may find it 
easier to backup to a SCSI hard disk before upgrading. If you need an 
internal hard disk for Powerbooks that handle the space requirements, 
check out <a href="http://www.powerbook1.com/" target="_top">MCE Products</a>.
 While you can install Jaguar or Panther on an external hard disk, it is
 only recommended for recovery purposes in case you find the Mac OS X 
version you just upgraded to is incompatible with software you use 
frequently, or in case of hard disk directory damage you can't recover 
from. If you have a 333 Mhz Mac or less, put it on the <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA20420">first 8 GB partition of drives larger than 8 GB</a>.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<a href="#TOP">Return to Top</a><br>
						<br>
						<a name="ARCHIVE">4.</a> Installing with Archive and Install - Before you Archive and Install, be sure your <a href="Macosxspeed.html#FSCK">file system directory checks out to be OK</a> as Apple has posted a knowledgebase stating an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA22324">archive and install over a bad directory is a bad idea</a>. Jaguar (10.2), and Panther (10.3) have an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160619044008/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1710">Archive and Install feature</a> which should be the way you upgrade from older versions of X if X was already installed on your machine.<br>
						When doing an Archive and Install, preserve user and network 
settings to preserve your ISP setup and any saved LAN settings.<br>
						Doing a simple upgrade install often results in a slower system. 
The upgrade CDs purchased for $20, or gotten free with machines released
 between July 17th and August 24th 2002 do not include this Archive and 
Install option. Only the full retail, or full install disks that were 
supposed to come with all Macs made after August 24th (call 
1-800-APLCARE if yours didn't come with those disks), have the Archive 
and Install option.<br>
						This is <b>not</b> a problem with the 10.3 Upgrade disks purchased
 from October 8, 2003 through February 29, 2004. Also the 10.3 retail 
disks include Archive and Install. Archive and install when you save 
user and network preferences moves Apple's own applications into the 
Previous System Folder's Applications folder, and moves the previous Mac
 OS X operating system folders into the Previous System Folder, as well 
as the Shared folder in the users folder (which is necessary for AOL to 
function, if you have AOL).<br>
						<b>IMPORTANT</b> If you are unable to preserve user and network 
preferences with the checkbox in the Archive and Install, your personal 
folders in the Users -&gt; your username folder will also get moved to 
the Users folder stored in the Previous System Folder, and a new Users 
folder of your username will be constructed with no contents except the 
default folders. This means iPhoto, iMovie, and iTunes data which were 
stored in Users -&gt; your username -&gt; Pictures, Movies, Music 
respectively will not be able to load your saved data in those folders 
until you move their content back to the newly constructed Users folder 
from the Users folder in the Previous System Folder. After doing an 
Archive and Install, should all other things below not work, attempt 
updating to the version of X that last worked using one of these 
updates. Please note, some people have found updating using the combo 
updater to the next version works better than the single version 
updater. Some have had success getting 10.2.5 and 10.2.6 to work better 
by archive and installing, then running the 10.2.3 combo updater, and 
then running either the 10.2.5 or 10.2.6 updater. Additional important 
tips for applying the following updates can be found on the <a href="upgradefaq.html">Upgrade FAQ</a>.</p>

 no rolling ball, but instead has a shining light on its bottom, it 
needs a surface that is textured. Uniform color surfaces with no 
patterns make it difficult for optical mice to track, thus making any 
dragging of the mouse over the surface appear to have little or no 
action. Use a textured mousepad or smooth surface that gives the mouse 
something visual to tell the difference of which surface it is tracking 
over. If your doing this and your mouse tracking is still slow, go to 
Apple menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Mouse to change your mouse 
tracking speed.<br>

						9. <a name="BACKUP"></a> <a href="backup.html">Backup</a> before running any utilities for Mac OS X. Backup your data religiously prior to running any disk utility with <a href="https://www.retrospect.com" target="_top">Roxio (formerly EMC, Dantz) Retrospect</a> or <a href="http://www.bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>
 to an external Firewire hard disk. These functions after a backup may 
help you recover a hard disk without having to go through the recovery 
software of the backup, though in case it fails, the backup recovery 
should always be an option. If you have one of these machines backup 
becomes somewhat more problematic:<br>
						<br>
						PCI PowerMac G4 - the graphics card used by these Macs use a <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT3082">PCI card and not an AGP graphics card</a>
 (link tells how to differentiate PCI and AGP). These Macs can't boot 
off Firewire hard drives which means backups may require working with a 
machine that can. The ease of recovering from a bootable backup is not 
there for these machines nor Blue and White PowerMac G3s.<br>
						<br>
						Both Beige PowerMac G3s, Powerbook G3s prior to 2000 can boot off 
SCSI hard drives, but it is hard to find a SCSI hard drive these days 
that will work with these machines.<br>
						The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061230155612/http://sonnettech.com:80/product/harmoni_g3.html">Tray Loading CD iMacs under 333 Mhz can have a Firewire port added to them</a> (product no longer displayed on original site), but that may not be bootable. Consult Sonnet as to whether that is possible.<br>
						The iMacs prior to the DV model that are not tray loading, and the
 iBooks prior to the DV model have no Firewire upgrade path, and USB is 
generally too slow to work with backing up Mac OS X entirely. For these 
Macs, a CD burner can be used for backup, but recognize media can 
deteriorate quickly with age, and you should frequently make duplicate 
backups to ensure you don't lose your data. A full recovery is slower 
when you don't have a machine you can boot from a backup.<br>
						<br>
						A word of warning, don't use Norton Utilities, as it is not 100% 
aware of the directory issues with Mac OS X and may corrupt directories 
of Mac OS X more often than save them:</p>
						Backing up should not be multitasked with other functions. Backup at when you sleep, or are not using the computer.

 (/sbin/fsck -y for Mac OS X 10.2.8 or earlier) several times to fix the
 directory using File System Check (the abbreviation of which is fsck). 
File System Check can also be initiated by your Mac OS X installer CD, 
from the Installer menu -&gt; Disk Utility -&gt; First Aid tab -&gt; 
select hard disk -&gt; select Repair Disk button. <b>Note: in Mac OS X 10.4 the Disk Utility menuitem in the installer has moved to the Utilities menu)</b>.

 function found in its Disk Utility. The Disk Utility is called by 
selecting it from the Installer (Utilities menu in 10.4's installer) 
menu, and repair permissions or privledges is found in its First Aid 
tab. If you have upgraded Jaguar or Panther past the version on your 
installer CD, you should use the Disk Utility program found in your 
Applications -&gt; Utilities folder instead. Do this repair when all 
other applications are quit. Be sure to also shut down the Classic 
environment from Apple menu -&gt; System preferences -&gt; Classic 
first. Permissions may get damaged by using Mac OS 9 applications either
 through booting into Mac OS 9 or running them in Classic.<br>
							Another utility that repairs permissions is <a href="http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/">Cocktail</a>.
 Note, since Cocktail is an all purpose utility, only use it for the 
feature shown here, as using another part of it to solve your problem 
may cause more problems in the long run. It is best to repair 
permissions from the Applications -&gt; Utility folder and not the 
installer CD if you have a newer version of Mac OS X on your hard disk. 
Though sometimes you may not have a choice, if the disk directory 
reports to be OK and you otherwise can't startup your machine 
completely. Mac OS X 10.1.5 users can use the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Repair-Privileges-Utility/3000-2094_4-10816445.html">Repair Priviliges Utility</a> for the same function as Jaguar and Panther's Disk utility's Repair Permissions.</li>

						<a name="PREBINDING">10.</a> Prebinding - WARNING!!! WARNING!!!<br>
						<br>
						Under the wrong conditions, prebinding, which is a standard step 
in Mac OS X security and system updates, can wipe your system. According
 to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070818121734/http://unsanity.org/archives/mac_os_x/shock_and_awe.php">Unsanity</a>, there is a bug which allows it to delete items that are in use during an update. Another reason why I strongly recommend you <a href="backup.html">backup your data</a>
 prior to performing any system update. In fact, if you don't backup, it
 is not a question of if, but when your data will be lost, so please 
read my FAQ on <a href="backup.html">backing up</a> before running into this bug.<br>
						<br>
						Jaguar (Mac OS X 10.2) was supposed to fix this issue, though it 
appears it hasn't since Apple still uses this routine when installing 
new updates. Some other software may not perform a prebinding, and leave
 the system in a slow state after installation. <a href="http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/">Cocktail</a>
 is able to prebind the system once it is backed up. Note, since 
Cocktail is an all purpose utility, only use it for the feature shown 
here, as using another part of it to solve your problem may cause more 
problems in the long run. You can read a very interesting note from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090715075243/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/LaunchTime/LaunchTime.html">Apple's Developer Website</a> about prebinding for developers.</p>

						<a name="CACHES">14.</a> Caches - <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT1199" target="_top">Apple knowledgebase article HT1199</a>
 explains how to clean caches safely in its "If the issue occurs in 
various applications, or in Mac OS X" sections 2 &amp; 3. Third party 
software that has the ability clean these caches may not be tested with 
the operating system you have, or may overdo this cleaning. So be sure 
to have a couple backups handy before attempting it, or restore your 
data first. See my <a href="backup.html" target="_top">backup FAQ</a>. 
Here are some third party utilities able to do it. I don't vouch for 
their ability, and as I say, use at your own discretion, only on a 
backed up system:<br>
						<br>
						<a href="http://www.northernsoftworks.com/jaguarcachecleaner.html">Jaguar/Panther/Tiger/Leopard/Snow Leoaprd Cache Cleaner</a>, or <a href="http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/">Cocktail</a>.
 Note cache clearing is something which some third party utilities such 
as MacCleaning, Cocktail, Jaguar/Panther/Tiger Cache Cleaner, Macaroni, 
Applejack, Onyx do as a benefit for troubleshooters. Unfortunately some 
websites and manuals have wrongly considered these "maintenance" 
utilities. Use of these utilities without a <a href="backup.html">backup</a>
 is unwise. If your cache gets really corrupted, you may be forced to 
erase and install, or face multiple applications which can't launch, and
 software which can't install. Be very careful which cache you remove, 
and only do so when you have a backup and know what you are doing. Note,
 since these are all multipurpose utilities, only use it for the feature
 shown here, as using another part of them to solve your problem may 
cause more problems in the long run. With clearing caches, it is 
important to remember to restart your computer from the Apple menu after
 finishing the task, otherwise you may not get the results you desire.<br>

						<a name="FONTS">30.</a> 10.6.7 Font bug addressed with <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1377" target="_top">Apple knowledgebase HT4605</a> and its companion download.<br>
						<br>
						Apple now has a listing of the fonts in 10.5, 10.4, and 10.3 on <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT1642">Knowledgebase article 307069</a>
 and the articles it refers to. Removing unnecessary or corrupted fonts 
will increase the speed of the machine a lot. However, you have to be 
careful which fonts you remove, as some are required by the system to 
operate and could potentially cause the system to freeze up if you 
remove them. Before removing any fonts, <a href="backup.html">backup your data at least twice</a>. If you already are in this precaurious state you can boot into <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190224221042/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1661">target</a>, an external hard drive, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT1492">single user mode</a> to manage the system and put them back where they belong. You will find fonts stored in:<br>
						<br>
						Hard drive -&gt; Library -&gt; Fonts<br>
						Hard drive -&gt; System -&gt; Library -&gt; Fonts<br>
						Hard drive -&gt; Users -&gt; yourname -&gt; Library -&gt; Fonts<br>
						<br>
						Also someone mentioned on Apple's Discussions board that the 
fontTablesAnnex file found in System -&gt; Library -&gt; Cache being 
deleted sometimes solves slow bootup issues. Font issues are also 
covered extensively in the user contributed FAQ found on Apple's 
Discussions Board by Kurt Lang <a href="http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html">on his own page</a>,<br>

<p><a name="TIGER">34.</a> Some unique slowdowns began with the advent 
of Mac OS X 10.4, Tiger back in 2005. They affect newer operating 
systems as well to some extent, although not as much. Still given the 
continued feedback on Apple's boards saying they exist, their solutions 
are listed below:<br>
						<br>
						The following features can affect the speed of Tiger if not properly utilized:</p>


						<ul>
							<li>Better late than never, but it has been learned that starting with 10.4.2 the scripts mentioned to <a href="#LOGFILE">clear the logfiles</a>
 will delay itself if your machine didn't allow it at the normal time, 
to the next reboot. So if you get a slow boot in Tiger, suspect the 
scripts, which could take a few minutes to complete.<br>
							&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Spotlight. The built in search engine of Tiger, affects how 
files can be found from the Open/Save dialog box, Find File, Mail, iCal 
(later OSes named Calendar), Addressbook (later OSes named Contacts), 
and Safari. If the index has not completed searching what you are 
looking for, finding results will be extremely slow. To find out if the 
index has completed, check out the menu in the upper right hand corner 
with the blue circle and white magnifying glass called the Spotlight 
menu. When you attach a new hard drive, or additional media on that 
machine hasn't been indexed on that machine, Spotlight will want to 
index it for search results. You can stop that indexing by going to 
Apple menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Spotlight and dragging the 
drive/disk icon you don't want indexed into the Privacy section of 
Spotlight. If you feel the index needs rebuilding, you can do the same 
thing to a drive that is already indexed. Usually though, the index will
 be automatically updated everytime you change a file Spotlight can find
 results from. Both PDF and text files are fully supported. Additional 
formats are mentioned on Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014">Spotlight</a> page. feature website.</li>
							<li>Dashboard. The ability to addon little controls through the 
Dashboard can be very tempting if you want instant access to web 
searchable data. And many have already created custom webtools to use on
 Dashboard. The one thing you may not be aware is that Dashboard as of 
10.4 still uses a lot of memory per widget, and leaving those widgets 
all enabled in your Home -&gt; Library -&gt; Widgets, and Hard Drive 
-&gt; Library -&gt; Widgets folder takes up a lot of memory. To find out
 just how much is taken up, see the Activity Monitor application in your
 Applications -&gt; Utilities folder. You can disable widgets manually 
just by taking them out of the Widgets folder. But for better 
customization of which widgets are active and not, a public domain 
software called <a href="http://downtownsoftwarehouse.com/software/WidgetManager/">Widget Manager</a>
 is available. As of Mac OS X 10.4.2, Apple has added a Manage Widgets 
button within Dashboard to check and uncheck widgets at will effectively
 making it possible to do without Widget Manager, though some may prefer
 using its method of disabling widgets. The Manage Widgets button 
appears when the widget toolbar is activated using the transparent plus 
sign (+) with a circle around it in the bottom left corner of the screen
 of Dashboard. When widgets are unchecked, the won't take up system 
memory, and only will take up space on the hard drive. In addition, 
Apple has written this article on managing <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT2254">Dashboard</a>, and there is this freeware which quits the Dashboard altogether called <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/dashquit.html">Dashquit</a>.</li>
							<li>Quicktime 7's H.264, Core Image, and iChat AV multiperson chat:<br>
							These three new features require a lot of processing and graphic processor power. Check Apple's website <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT1582">on core image</a>
 to learn exactly what's required for these high end tasks. If you want 
those sophisticated features, it is time to at least upgrade your 
graphics processor, if not the CPU depending on the Mac model you have. 
You don't have to use H.264, as many other video compression schemes use
 less powerful processors. But if you want HD Video at the level that 
Apple is demanding for these new standards, be prepared to save for a 
system upgrade.</li>

						<a name="INTEL">35.</a> With the migration to Intel, you may find 
applications which act more slowly under a PowerPC Mac.&nbsp;&nbsp; Same
 with the migration from Intel to Apple Silicon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both 
migrations use a software <a href="http://www.apple.com/rosetta/">Rosetta</a>. There is a software called <a href="http://www.splook.com/Software/" target="_top">TrimTheFat</a>
 to remove that excess code which makes applications work both on Intel 
and PowerPC natively. Mind you, I have not tried this, so make a backup 
of your program before attempting the use of this program. To tell if an
 application may need to be trimmed, select Get Info on it in the 
Finder's File menu, and look for the section on the "Platform." If it 
says Intel, and you are on a PowerPC Mac (a G3, G4, G5), then this 
program may help you. Mind you, once you migrate to Intel, you'll have 
to reinstall the full Universal Binary version again of that program. 
For more on the Intel Transition see my <a href="macosxnative.html#INTEL">Migration from 9 to X FAQ's section on it</a>.&nbsp; <br>

<p><a name="BATTERY">36.</a> Notebook batteries can cause two very 
prevalent issues to slow down your Mac. First off, Apple menu -&gt; 
System Preferences -&gt; Energy Saver has a setting you can alter the 
performance of the machine so it doesn't drain the battery.<br>
						<br>
						Secondly, it appears that MacBook and MacBook Pros will reduce 
their processor speed to respond to running off A/C power without a 
notebook battery connected according to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130615084258/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2332">Apple Knowledgebase article 305336</a>.
 This I would consider a bug, since battery performance is degraded by 
constantly leaving the battery in after it has been fully charged. 
Complain to AppleCare and point them to this article to let them know 
you think this should be changed.<br>

						<a name="NetworkDrive">39.</a> iCloud, Google Drive, SANs, Time Capsule can all be causes of slowdowns when not properly setup. <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-google-drive-crashing-finder-in-mavericks/">Google Drive has settings</a>
 which have been documented to optimize it. iCloud setup is in Apple 
menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; iCloud. Also look under 
Notifications to see if iCloud is sending you notifications or other 
utilities are if you have an operating system that uses it under System 
Preferences. It is best to backup your data when you aren't multitasking
 with other features. See the Time Machine tips on my <a href="backup.html">Backup FAQ</a> to avoid multitasking its backups as well as Time Capsule.<br>

<p><a name="SAFEMODE"></a>40. Safe mode can repair many issues with the operating system taking
 up too much space.&nbsp; Restarting the Mac holding the shift key down,
 logging in, and restarting again without will often free up many GB of 
data.&nbsp; Apple menu -&gt; Restart should always be used to restart 
the Mac.&nbsp; If other programs are running before you restart, 
command-tab to each non-Finder program and quit from it's own menu 
before you restart the Mac.<br>
</p>
<p>Safe mode is also an excellent way to determine if third party 
drivers are causing slowdown of your system.&nbsp; Software that 
requires no additional drivers to connect to peripherals usually run 
normally in safe mode.&nbsp; This may create some issues with printing 
and connectivity to some peripherals.<br>
