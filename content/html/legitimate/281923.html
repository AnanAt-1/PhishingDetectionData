<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">I thought it might be nice to have an update in 2003 - after all, we're over 3 months in.  Sorry for my lack of interest but it does more or less accurately reflect the lack of going-ons.  If you want updates rather than the archive of information on this site you're best checking out <a href="http://www.acornarcade.com/" target="_new">Acorn Arcade</a>
<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">
<a href="http://home.t-online.de/~zarquon/DIY.html" target="_new">Doom It Yourself</a> is now on version 4.4, adding 32-bit compatibility and bilinear resampling to the existing build-it-yourself <i>Doom</i> port.
<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">Theo v/d Boogaert has added some new game patches to <a href="http://home.wanadoo.nl/tvdb
">his website</a>, including ones for <i>Boogie Buggy</i>, <i>Warlocks</i> and <i>Dungeon</i>.
<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">Nex has released <a href="http://www.cloudsprinter.com/software/" target="_new">some free games for RISC OS</a> - check out <a href="http://www.cloudsprinter.com/software/" target="_new">the website</a>.
<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%"><i>Tek</i> now (as of late February...) works with Viewfinder cards.
<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">A second release of the <i>Tek</i> Pyro update is also now available  (er, well, since late January) from <a href="http://www.artexsoft.com/" target="_new">Artex's website</a>, which fixes some bugs.  I did update my <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Tek/index">review of <i>Tek</i></a> to take account of the Pyro update and do various screenshots, but that version is still sitting on my computer about 75% complete.  Impressive, I know.
<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">David McEwen (he of all the emulators) worked on a port of <i>Elite TNK - The New Kind</i> but it isn't available for download due to David Braben, original Elite co-author, requiring it not be made available - see <a href="http://www.newkind.co.uk" target="_new">http://www.newkind.co.uk</a>.
<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">Rik Griffin has put up <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/rik.griffin/" target="_new">a tutorial for the Popcorn sprite-plotting library</a>.
<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">I think it's probably fair to admit that I don't have any plans to update this site regularly from now on - the Acorn games scene is more or less dead (other than the occasional non-commercial effort) and so it's no longer much of an interest of mine.  Thanks to the generosity of Richard Goodwin at <a href="http://www.onepointnought.com/" target="_new">onepointnought</a> the site will stay online for the foreseeable future as an information resource, and I'll probably put the odd update online from time to time - much like this one, in fact!
<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">One other thing - Acorn Gaming is 10 years old this year, and that makes it one of the longest lasting web sites on <i>any</i> subject.  It's certainly the longest-running Acorn-related website too, once you exclude pages that have remained completely static for long periods of time (matters of years, I mean).  The official birthday is actually November 2003, however.

The game is intended to be free with a small charge for each additional level you download.  There will also be a web site level editor so you can make your own levels and graphics publically available.  Meanwhile <a href="http://www.masabi.com/" target="_new">Masabi</a> are also keen to convert other classic Superior titles, so if you have any suggestions they'd like to hear from you (check their <a href="http://www.masabi.com/" target="_new">website</a> for contact details) - current ideas include <i>Pipeline</i>, <i>Ravenskull</i> and maybe <i>Thrust</i>.

This fixes the crashes some people were experiencing, including those when saving the game and producing new units, and problems with credits have also been fixed (headquarters now cost 250 not 2500 credits, and you can't have negative credits any more).  Also a welcome pause feature has been added - use 'P' to pause and unpause the game.  Artex are also pleased that the game sold well at Wakefield, so maybe the missing network play features - which are promised if enough sales are achieved - could eventually be on the way!

As I write R-Comp are busy making the CDs from the release version of the game that Artex have finalised.  I've tried this new version and it is definitely faster than the preview I had last week so it's now just fast enough to play on a Risc PC 700, although it still definitely prefers a StrongARM!  Official requirement is for a &quot;RiscStation R7500, 16 MB RAM, 60 MB harddisc space, CD drive&quot; whilst the recommend spec is &quot;StrongARM RiscPC, 16 MB RAM, 2 MB VRAM, 60 MB harddisc space, CD drive

I've been playing a prerelease version of <i>Tek</i>, so I can tell you that it definitely exists  and it's looking promising!  The ability to draw patrol paths and then attach troops to them is particularly nice.  The version of the game I have isn't 100% optimised yet so I imagine it will be a few days yet before it's being sent out - in fact this version is just slightly too slow to play on an ARM710 machine unless you're rather patient, but Artex tell me that they'll have a faster version possibly within 24 hours.  So it's all looking good - more news as I get it and once I've had more time to playtest, but not until Monday.  Typical - no news for ages and then a big event comes along whilst I'm away! <tt>:)</tt> [<i>An earlier and more detailed version of this news story was partially lost in a file corruption</i>]

on the success of <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Ankh/"><i>Ankh</i></a>,
<a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Exodus/"><i>Exodus</i></a> and
<a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Botkiller2/"><i>Botkiller 2</i></a> with the
release of <i>TEK</i> shortly after Christmas.
Orders are now being accepted for what must be one of the most
anticipated RISC OS titles of all time - and what will sadly
also probably be the last major release ever seen on this platform.
<i>TEK</i> comes bundles with lots of extras, and if you pre-order
(which requires no deposit) then not only do you get full versions
of <i>Ankh</i>, <i>Exodus</i> and <i>Botkiller 2</i> (plus editor) which will be included
with <b>every</b> copy of <i>TEK</i>, but you'll also get an
additional mystery gift too - Artex describe it as &quot;a little goodie&quot;.
Retailing at &pound;30, you can preorder either via
<a href="mailto:rci@rcomp.demon.co.uk" target="_new">rci@rcomp.demon.co.uk</a> or
<a href="mailto: tek@artexsoft.com" target="_new">tek@artexsoft.com</a>. The game
will also reveal what the titular <i>1608</i> refers to - Artex
previously ran a competition to guess what it meant, which noone won!

disillusionment with the platform and its lack of direction.&quot;  So why should you care?
Just <a href="http://www.acornemus.freeserve.co.uk" target="_new">take a look at David's website</a> and observe the huge range of emulators and game playing
software he's ported or created. (He's happy to <a href="mailto:david@acornemus.freeserve.co.uk" target="_new">receive
comments</a> on this decision).

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">An update to the story on the 14/11/01 below about the new games library being ported to RISC
OS. I've since played a game compiled using a test build of this library and I'm pleased to report
it's looking promising - well, it works at any rate although there are still a few issues to be
resolved such as adding sound. More news on a release date for the first of these games when I get
it.

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%"><a href="mailto:kevin@bracey-griffith.freeserve.co.uk" target="_new">Kevin Bracey</a>'s adventure game
player <i>Zip 2000</i> has been updated again to reach version 1.41, adding drag and drop file handling
to integrate it even more tightly with the RISC OS desktop. You can
<a href="http://www.bracey-griffith.freeserve.co.uk/Zip2000/" target="_new">download the
new version from his website</a> (or <a href="index.php3?p=Download/desktop">Acorn Gaming</a>).

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">I updated the copy in <a href="index.php3?p=Download/">the Download section</a> a couple of weeks ago, but just to note
that David McEwen's port of <i>ScummVM</i>, the LucasArt point-and-click adventure game player,
was updated to version 0.31 which fixed a timing bug in
the first release. David's hoping to make a new release soon but hints on <a href="http://www.acornemus.freeserve.co.uk" target="_new">his
website</a> that due to lack of feedback he may soon stop working on RISC OS ports of emulators and
game players, which would be a shame!

2000</i>, his RISC OS Z-code adventure game interpreter. It now supports even more features in
some games, but it was already very impressive - <a href="index.php3?p=Free/Zip2000/">click here for

responsible for bringing more emulators than can be counted to RISC OS (over 20!), but he's
now also added a port of <i>ScummVM</i> to the collection
<a href="http://www.acornemus.freeserve.co.uk/" target="_new">available on his website</a>. This isn't an
emulator, however (see <a href="index.php3?p=Emulation/">the emulation news</a> for details of his
latest work in that area), but an application which lets you play classic LucasArts mouse-driven
graphical adventure games (in the vein of <i>Simon the Sorceror</i> et al) such as <i>Monkey
Island</i> and <i>Day of the Tentacle</i>. You'll need to get hold of the PC originals, but
these are available incredibly cheaply now due to their age and in compilations of multiple
games. Due to its required spec you'll need a Risc PC or later to run it. <a href="http://www.acornemus.freeserve.co.uk/" target="_new">Download it now
from his website</a>.

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%"><a href="index.php3?p=Previews/Tek/">Artex's <i>TEK</i></a> didn't make the RISC OS 2001 show and
has now been rescheduled for a release this Christmas - and it might actually make this
release date since <a href="http://www.artexsoft.com/tek/index.html" target="_new">Artex</a> say that it's
now very nearly complete and is currently undergoing beta testing. They're not expecting to
release a demo version prior to the final release, however. (Meanwhile, Artex's <a href="index.php3?p=Previews/ID/"><i>Iron Dignity</i>
</a> website hasn't been updated since March but it seems unlikely that this will see an Acorn release
now.)

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%"><a href="http://www.paradise-uk.net/" target="_new">Paradise</a>, publishers of those neat little games
<a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Inferno/"><i>Inferno</i></a> and <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Overload/"><i>Overload</i></a>,
have announced a special offer on these two games - you can now buy either game for just &pound;5
or both for only &pound;8. Both these games come highly recommended.  Paradise are also selling their
parallel port joypad interface for &pound;12.99 and have also announced a graphics tablet - <a href="http://www.paradise-uk.net/" target="_new">see their
website</a> for further details. They'll also sent you a disc with information and demos if you
mail them a pound coin to the address on their website.

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">If what I've been told is accurate, then RISC OS could soon be seeing quite an influx of
newly ported free games thanks to work on implementing a reasonably widely-used games library of
graphic and other routines (the relevant site currently lists over 150 games that use it). It's not
quite finished yet but apparently all the major work
is done and some ported games are already being played. I'm yet to see this for myself, but if this
all works out then it could be very good news! The first release might be any day now, apparently.

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">In August 1995 Andy Southgate release the third and final major release of his
impressive free Acorn games programming library, <i>GameSuite</i>, used in both <i>Asylum</i>

resurrect development and has set up <a href="http://www.smartgroups.com/groups/gamesuite" target="_new">a

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">If you're a <i>Repton</i> fan then you might appreciate a new RISC OS desktop version
using the maps from the original BBC Micro <i>Repton 3</i> and its various add-on level sets.
<a href="mailto:Dbproaction@aol.com" target="_new">ProAction Software</a>'s new release costs &pound;14.90
and is available from <a href="http://www.apdl.co.uk/" target="_new">APDL</a>.

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">Platform puzzler <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Botkiller2/"><i>Botkiller 2</i></a> has been
rereleased as freeware and is now available for download from <a
href="http://www.artexsoft.com" target="_new">Artex's website</a>. Even if you already own the game it's
worth downloading because it includes a level designer.

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">If you yearn for the days of the original Archimedes welcome disc or the first RISC OS
application discs then take a look at <a href="http://www.eclipse.co.uk/gilberts/archiology/" target="_new">

described as &quot;the ancient Chinese game of Mah Jongg,&quot; then you might want to
download this <a href="http://shanghai.riscos.org.uk" target="_new">new version</a> (1.05).

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%"><a href="http://www.cjemicros.co.uk/4d/" target="_new">The 4th Dimension</a> claim that most of their

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%"><i>Descent 2</i> did get the updated version described in the news story on from the
25th of August. The new release saw the addition of network play as well as an optimised
ARM710/ARM7500 version - but the publishers <a href="http://www.rcomp.co.uk/" target="_new">R-Comp</a> note
that they &quot;wouldn't encourage users of these machines to purchase the game as a single
player title.&quot;

<tr><td bgcolor="#a0eed0" align=left width="100%">I don't think I've mentioned this before, but if you're ever looking for an Acorn game

AcornSearch</a>.

<tr><td bgcolor="#b0ffb0" align=left width="100%">As the large number of stories in this group also reveals, you might have noticed that
there have been a limited amount of updates over the past couple of months (ie. none!) - sorry
about this, but at least I've now submitted my Ph.D thesis. <tt>:)</tt>

the wonderfully inventive and witty platform game from GEK, then you've now got a second
chance since it's being rereleased as part of a new compilation CD by <a href="mailto:info@apdl.co.uk" target="_new">APDL/ProAction</a>.
Repackaged along with 32-bit versions of classic games <i>Frak</i> and <i>Joust</i>, and also joined
by shoot'em'up <i>EuroBlaster</i>, this is all pretty good value at &pound;9.90 plus &pound;1 P&amp;P
so long as you have the requisite Risc PC 600 or above (although in my opinion <i>Euroblaster</i>
and some levels of <i>Emotions</i> are a little slow without a StrongARM).
Back to <i>Emotions</i>, check out <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/Emotions/">the review</a> to see what Acorn

then you might like to try out the two extra tracks on <a href="http://www.arsvcs.demon.co.uk/leisure/dload/dload.htm" target="_new">R-Comp's website</a>
<li>Fantasia FAN announced earlier this month that they were still working on <a href="index.php3?p=Previews/ToyParty/"><i>Toy Party</i></a> and
have also been working on a generic library to allow other games to be written more quickly. They
promise more news soon.
<li>Talking of Fantasia, this is a good place to mention that I also noticed that
their previous title, the originally hugely-overpriced <a href="index.php3?p=Reviews/WizApp/"><i>Wizard Apprentice</i></a>,
is now available at a bargain price of &pound;6.90 from <a href="http://www.apdl.co.uk/swlist.htm" target="_new">APDL</a> - if
you like puzzle games then it's not bad at all and well worth taking a look at.
