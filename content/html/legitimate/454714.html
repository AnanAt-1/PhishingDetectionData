Brakhage spent the next few years living in near poverty, depressed about what he saw as the failure of his work. He briefly considered suicide. While living in Denver, Brakhage met Mary Jane Collom, whom he married in late 1957. Known as Jane Brakhage, she became his first wife. Brakhage tried to make money on his films, but had to take a job making industrial shorts&nbsp;to support his family. In 1958, Jane gave birth to the first of the five children they would have together, an event Brakhage recorded for his 1959 film <i><a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("97669",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("97669")' href="/topics/Window_Water_Baby_Moving">Window Water Baby Moving</a><span class="hp" id="m97669"><div class="hpHeader">Window Water Baby Moving</div><div class="hpContent">Window Water Baby Moving is an experimental short film by Stan Brakhage, filmed in November 1958 and released in 1959.

When Brakhage's early films had been exhibited in the 1950s, they had often been met with derision, but in the early 1960s Brakhage began to receive recognition in exhibitions and film publications, including <i>Film Culture</i>, which awarded several of his films, including <i>The Dead</i>, in 1962.
