        <br>
        The Redpath Museum of McGill University exists to foster the study of 
        the history and diversity of the natural world. Its mandate includes geological, 
        biological and cultural diversity and it carries out conventional academic 
        teaching and research activities on the scale of academic departments 
        of comparable size. The museum also provides academic services to other 
        units. Its distinctive feature is the preservation and curation of objects, 
        the registration of their existence, and the provision of access to other 
        collections. Through the public display and interpretation of these objects, 
        it both advances undergraduate and graduate education, and serves the 
        general public. </font></p>

        The Museum is one of McGill's most prominent buildings, looking out over 
        the McGill campus. The Museum was commissioned in 1880 by Peter Redpath, 
        a prominent businessman who owned Canada's first sugar refinery, to preserve 
        and display the collections of Sir William Dawson. Dawson had in his possession 
        a collection of fossils and minerals from Nova Scotia, of great scientific 
        value. Peter Redpath publicly announced his donation at a banquet held 
        on April 1880 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Dawson's appointment 
        at McGill. Architects A.C. Hutchison and A.D. Steele were appointed to 
        design the building. <img src="redpathmuseum.jpg" width="350" height="361" align="right" alt="The Redpath Museum. Photo: Torsten Bernhardt"></font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The opening of the Redpath 
        Museum in August, 1882 coincided with the American Association for the 
        Advancement of Science annual meeting held at McGill that year. The building 
        was singled out as one of the best examples of the "good modern work" 
        that had been erected in Canada. Initially it was intended that the museum 
        and its collections should be in the first place for the professors and 
        students of McGill College and University and secondarily for all the 
        students of Natural Science and for the public. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1952, the Museum broadened 
        its focus to become effectively a natural history museum for elementary 
        and high school students. In 1971, McGill under extreme financial pressure, 
        dramatically reduced public access and focused on its scientific research 
        and teaching roles. In 1985-86 the doors of the Museum were once again 
        opened in a limited way to the general public. Today, the Museum is opened 
        to the McGill population, the public at large and visiting school groups. 
        Its public program includes guided tours and children's discovery workshops 
        in both official languages. </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The purpose of the Redpath 
        Biodiversity Project (RBP) is to provide a central registry of information 
        about biological diversity. This information consists of biological surveys 
        in digital format. It is supplemented by digital maps of the geographical 
        region covered by a survey, including elevation, drainage, climate, land 
        use and other landscape features. This allows the fauna and flora of an 
        area to be related to the structure of the landscape. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The scope of the RBP is both 
        local and global. The local projects are directed towards providing an 
        account of biological diversity in Quebec accessible through the web and 
        therefore available to the general public. This work is funded by the 
        Quebec government. The global projects are concerned to collect the most 
        reliable and systematic biological surveys available, from any region 
        of the world. This work is funded primarily through federal and provincial 
        research grants. All projects are conducted from a computer facility located 
        at the Redpath Museum of McGill University. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The value of the RBP will 
        grow as its data base expands, and so we are always eager to add new high-quality 
        data. Any digital records supplied to us are stored on a server and backed 
        up. They will be used for educational purposes only, and will not be made 
        available to any third party without the express permission of the donor. 
        We are always willing to collaborate by providing supplementary data for 
        a group or a region. </font>
