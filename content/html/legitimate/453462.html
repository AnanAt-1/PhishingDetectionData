Another problem that hobbled CNR was in the sheer number of low-volume branch railway lines, which did not produce sufficient traffic to pay for their operation.

One tactic that CNR perfected was to <i>demarket</i> a line by providing sufficiently poor service to its few customers, that those customers would turn to trucks for improved service and lower costs.  Once customers ceased to exist on a small branch line, the federal government would permit the line's abandonment.

From the creation of CNR in 1918 until its recapitalization in 1978, whenever the company posted a deficit, the federal government would assume those costs in the government budget.  The result of various governments using CNR as a vehicle for various social and economic policies was a subsidization running into billions of dollars over successive decades.  Following its 1978 recapitalization and changes in management, CN (name changed to <b>Canadian National Railway</b>, using the shortened acronym <b>CN</b> in 1960) started to operate much more efficiently, by assuming its own debt, improving accounting practices to allow depreciation of assets and to access financial markets for further capital.  Now operating as a for-profit Crown corporation, CN reported a profit in 11 of the 15 years from 1978 to 1992, paying $371 million in cash dividends (profit) to the federal government during this time.<br />

All proceeds from such sales were used to pay down CN's accumulated debt.  At the time of their divestitures, all of these subsidiaries required considerable subsidies, which partly explained CN's financial problems prior to recapitalization.<br />

CN also was given free rein by the federal government following deregulation of the railway industry in the 1970s, as well as in 1987, when railway companies began to make tough business decisions by removing themselves from operating money-losing branch lines.  In CN's case, some of these branch lines were those it had been forced to absorb through federal government policies and outright patronage, while others were from the heady expansion era of rural branchlines in the 1920s and early 1930s and were considered obsolete following the development of local road networks.<br />

This was achieved largely through aggressive cuts to the company's bloated and inefficient management structure, widescale layoffs in its workforce and continued abandonment or sale of its branch lines.  In 1993 and 1994 the company experimented with a rebranding that saw the names <i>CN</i>, <i>Grand Trunk Western</i>, and <i>Duluth, Winnipeg, and Pacific</i> replaced under a collective <b>CN North America</b> moniker.  During this time, CPR and CN entered into negotiations regarding a possible merger of the two companies.  This was later rejected by the federal government, whereby CPR offered to purchase outright all of CN's lines from Ontario to Nova Scotia, while an unidentified U.S. railroad (rumoured to have been <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("78241",this,"burlington_northern_railroad.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("78241")' href="/topics/Burlington_Northern_Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a><span class="hp" id="m78241"><div class="hpHeader">Burlington Northern Railroad</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i78241"></div>The Burlington Northern Railroad  was a United States-based railroad company formed from a merger of four major U.S. railroads.

In 1995, the entire company including its U.S. subsidiaries reverted to using <b>CN</b> exclusively.<br />

<H3>Retraction and expansion since privatization</H3>
Following the successful IPO, CN has recorded impressive gains in its stock price, largely through an aggressive network rationalization and purchase of newer more fuel-efficient locomotives.  Numerous branch lines were shed during the late 1990s across Canada, resulting in dozens of independent short line&nbsp;railway companies being established to operate former CN track that had been considered marginal.  This network rationalization resulted in a core east-west freight railway stretching from Halifax to Chicago and Toronto to Vancouver and Prince Rupert.  The railway also operated trains from Winnipeg to Chicago using trackage rights for part of the route south of Duluth.<br />

In addition to the retraction in Canada, the company also expanded in a  strategic north-south direction in the central United States.

The STB's decision was to become effective on Jan. 23, 2009, with a closure of the transaction shortly thereafter. The EJ&E lines create a bypass around the western side of heavily congested Chicago-area rail hub and its conversion to use for mainline freight traffic is expected to alleviate substantial bottlenecks for both regional and intercontinental rail traffic subject to lengthy delays entering and exiting Chicago freight yards. The purchase of the lightly used EJ&E corridor was positioned by CN as a boon not only for its own business but for the efficiency of the entire US rail system.<br />

Since the Illinois Central purchase in 1998 CN has been increasingly focused on running a "scheduled freight railroad/railway", meeting on-time performance with rail industry-leading consistency.  This has resulted in improved shipper relations, as well as reduced the need for maintaining pools of surplus locomotives and freight cars.  CN has also undertaken a rationalization of its existing track network by removing double track sections in some areas and extending passing sidings in other areas.<br />
<br />
CN is also a rail industry leader in the employment of radio-control (R/C) for switching locomotives in yards, resulting in reductions to the number of yard workers required.

In December 1999 the <i>Ultratrain</i>, a petroleum products unit train linking the Levis (Quebec) <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("28511",this,"ultramar.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("28511")' href="/topics/Ultramar">Ultramar</a><span class="hp" id="m28511"><div class="hpHeader">Ultramar</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i28511"></div>Ultramar is a Canadian oil refining and marketing company formerly known as Golden Eagle or Aigle d'or.

The train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld; the report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called into question CN's quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels. In memory of the dead crewmen, two new stations on the line have been named after them (Davis and Thériault).<br />
<br />
About 9:04 a.m. central standard time on February 9, 2003, northbound Canadian National freight train M33371 derailed 22 of its 108 cars in Tamaroa, Illinois. Four of the derailed cars released methanol, and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire. Other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and vinyl chloride. Two cars containing hydrochloric acid, one car containing formaldehyde, and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire. About 850 residents were evacuated from the area within a 3 miles (4.8 km) radius of the derailment, which included the entire village of Tamaroa. Improper  placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars, where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that, because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions, rapidly progressed to rail failure.<br />
<br />
On May 14, 2003, a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near McBride, B.C., killing both crew members. Both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge, claiming it was unsafe. It was revealed that as far back as 1999, several bridge components had been reported as rotten, yet no repairs had been ordered by management. Eventually, the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously.<br />

Controversy arose again in Canadian political circles in 2003 following the company's decision to refer solely to its acronym "CN" and not "Canadian National", a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to "Canada".

<H4> A "culture of fear" </H4>
In response to such high-profile derailments, the federal minister of transportation created an advisory panel to review the Railway Safety Act in February 2007. The panel's report in March 2008 identified a culture of fear and discipline at CN in particular that undermines the <a rel='nofollow' class='greylink1' href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/tcss/RSA_Review-Examen_LSF/FinalReport/chapter5.htm#5">safety management system</a> (SMS) that was introduced in 2001 to give rail companies more responsibility over safety.<br />
<br />
"CN's strict adherence to a rules-based approach, focused largely on disciplinary actions when mistakes are made, has instilled a ‘culture of fear and discipline’ and is counter to an effective safety management system. CN needs to acknowledge this openly and take concrete steps to improve," stated the panel.<br />
<br />
The goal of the safety management system was to move away from a compliance approach and toward a proactive approach in which companies assess and mitigate risks on their own initiative. The concept as applied to railways was born during the 1994 review of the Railway Safety Act and amendments to act were introduced in 1999 that added requirements for railway companies to develop and implement safety management systems.<br />
<br />
"The key for railway companies was to become more proactive, to refine their abilities to identify hazards, and to assess and mitigate risks. The need for companies to build a safety consciousness into their day-to-day operations was of paramount importance. This represented a shift from the traditional reactive approach of considering what had happened in a post-accident environment", stated the panel's report.<br />
<br />
The effectiveness of SMS depends on the safety culture within the organization. That's defined as a culture where safety is entrenched in the thinking of managers and employees alike, where open communication allows comparison and improvement of ongoing practices. It also depends on employee involvement, who can be "a company's prime source of information for the identification of hazards and assessment of mitigation strategies."<br />
<br />
However, the panel heard "...from many railway employees who felt neither involved nor informed about their company's safety management system. Rather, employees often described their organizational culture in such a way that the Panel could not reconcile it with an effective safety culture."<br />
<br />
The panel cited the example of passenger rail company <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("28332",this,"via_rail.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("28332")' href="/topics/VIA_Rail">Via Rail</a><span class="hp" id="m28332"><div class="hpHeader">VIA Rail</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i28332"></div>Via Rail Canada   is an independent crown corporation offering intercity passenger rail services in Canada. It is headquartered near Montreal Central Station at 3 Place Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec....</div><br></span>&nbsp;to illustrate a safety culture needed for SMS. Via's implementation of SMS is successful because the company makes safety management important to all employees. While there are certain cardinal rules that lead to disciplinary action if broken, Via also has processes to build openness and trust between managers and employees. "For instance, employees are observed at regular cycles, and corrective coaching takes place immediately when errors are observed," the panel report noted.<br />
<br />
In contrast, CN manages safety through an "antecedent, behaviour and consequences" process, which the panel said is based on a traditional rule and discipline model. It quoted <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("78960",this,"united_transportation_union.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("78960")' href="/topics/United_Transportation_Union">United Transportation Union</a><span class="hp" id="m78960"><div class="hpHeader">United Transportation Union</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i78960"></div>The United Transportation Union  is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a broad-based, transportation labor union representing about 125,000 active and retired railroad, bus, mass transit, and airline  workers in the United States....</div><br></span>&nbsp;leader Sylvia Leblanc's description of CN's attitude towards safety as one that "seems to be ‘blame and punish’ instead of ‘educate and correct.’ Frequently, employees involved in accidents… are simply blamed for errors without followup or root cause investigation. They are then punished without any other corrective action taken on the part of the railway to prevent reoccurrences."<br />
<br />
A management culture that relies on discipline, or threat of discipline, to enforce rules has "a tendency to instil fear, and to stifle employee participation and reporting," the panel report stated. "A significant mistrust of management develops. People stop communicating — and that can have a detrimental impact on safety."<br />

When CNR was first created, it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways, but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network.  For example, on December 3, 1920, CNR inaugurated the <i>Continental Limited</i>, which operated over four of its predecessors, as well as the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway.  The 1920s saw growth in passenger travel, and CNR inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services, such as radio, on its trains.<br />

<br />
Beginning in the early summer months of 2010, CN purchased a small order of C40-8's and C40-8W's from UP and BNSF, respectively. The intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative. CN has stayed firmly committed to conventional direct-current traction motors, instead of the new alternating-current motors being used by many railways in heavy-haul service.<br />
<br />
Comfort cab<br />
CN locomotives have long featured unique features, unlike the stock EMD and GE locomotives. CN introduced a wide-nosed four window <i>Comfort Cab,</i> the predecessor to the now standard <i>North American Safety Cab</i>, which is now standard on new North American freight locomotives.<br />
<br />
Ditch lights<br />
After a BC derailment, CN introduced ditch lights, lights mounted on or just below the anti-climbers on the front pilot of a locomotive. These are arranged in a "cross-eyed" configuration, to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, ditch lights have become standard features on all North American locomotives.<br />
<br />
Class and Marker lights<br />
CN continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years, up to as recently as the C40-8M and SD60F (which feature red, green and white class lights), and the first order C44-9WL locomotives which retained white class lights. More recently, CN has had red marker lights installed on their ES44DC and SD70M-2 locomotives, for use when the locomotives are in DPU service.<br />
<br />
Windshields<br />
CN's first few orders of ES44DC's, like their C44-9W's, feature "tear-drop" windshields, windshields with the outer lower corner dropped (like earlier SD70Is) as opposed to the standard rectangular GE windshield, to allow for better visibility.<br />
<br />
Headlights<br />
The first order of SD70M-2 locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab, while the second order (8800 series) dropped the headlight to the nose, and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab.<br />
<br />
Control stands<br />
While many railroads have ordered new "desktop" controls, where the controls are arranged on a desk&mdash;CN returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer, which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally. This arrangement makes reverse operation easier, and allows engineers to "put their feet up," without feeling stuck at a desk all day.<br />
<br />
Car body<br />
CN's General Motors SD50F, SD60F, and General Electric C40-8M feature a full-width car body that is tapered to allow for better rear visibility. This is referred to as a "Draper taper" after its creator. The first order of the GE C44-9 (2500–2522) was also initially an order for 18 locomotives with the full-width Draper Taper car body. They were changed to a standard long hood with a CN-style 4-window cab and the order was increased to 23 locomotives at the same price.<br />

Canadian National Railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency.  Railways, until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayer-funded all-weather highways, were the only viable long-distance land transportation available in Canada for many years. As such, their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention.

One tactic that CNR perfected was to <i>demarket</i> a line by providing sufficiently poor service to its few customers, that those customers would turn to trucks for improved service and lower costs.

From the creation of CNR in 1918 until its recapitalization in 1978, whenever the company posted a deficit, the federal government would assume those costs in the government budget.  The result of various governments using CNR as a vehicle for various social and economic policies was a subsidization running into billions of dollars over successive decades.  Following its 1978 recapitalization and changes in management, CN (name changed to <b>Canadian National Railway</b>, using the shortened acronym <b>CN</b> in 1960) started to operate much more efficiently, by assuming its own debt, improving accounting practices to allow depreciation of assets and to access financial markets for further capital.  Now operating as a for-profit Crown corporation, CN reported a profit in 11 of the 15 years from 1978 to 1992, paying $371 million in cash dividends (profit) to the federal government during this time.<br />

Numerous branch lines were shed during the late 1990s across Canada, resulting in dozens of independent short line&nbsp;railway companies being established to operate former CN track that had been considered marginal.  This network rationalization resulted in a core east-west freight railway stretching from Halifax to Chicago and Toronto to Vancouver and Prince Rupert.  The railway also operated trains from Winnipeg to Chicago using trackage rights for part of the route south of Duluth.<br />

In addition to the retraction in Canada, the company also expanded in a  strategic north-south direction in the central United States.

The STB's decision was to become effective on Jan. 23, 2009, with a closure of the transaction shortly thereafter. The EJ&E lines create a bypass around the western side of heavily congested Chicago-area rail hub and its conversion to use for mainline freight traffic is expected to alleviate substantial bottlenecks for both regional and intercontinental rail traffic subject to lengthy delays entering and exiting Chicago freight yards. The purchase of the lightly used EJ&E corridor was positioned by CN as a boon not only for its own business but for the efficiency of the entire US rail system.<br />

The train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld; the report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called into question CN's quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels. In memory of the dead crewmen, two new stations on the line have been named after them (Davis and Thériault).<br />
<br />
About 9:04 a.m. central standard time on February 9, 2003, northbound Canadian National freight train M33371 derailed 22 of its 108 cars in Tamaroa, Illinois. Four of the derailed cars released methanol, and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire. Other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and vinyl chloride. Two cars containing hydrochloric acid, one car containing formaldehyde, and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire. About 850 residents were evacuated from the area within a 3 miles (4.8 km) radius of the derailment, which included the entire village of Tamaroa. Improper  placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars, where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that, because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions, rapidly progressed to rail failure.<br />
<br />
On May 14, 2003, a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near McBride, B.C., killing both crew members. Both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge, claiming it was unsafe. It was revealed that as far back as 1999, several bridge components had been reported as rotten, yet no repairs had been ordered by management. Eventually, the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously.<br />

Controversy arose again in Canadian political circles in 2003 following the company's decision to refer solely to its acronym "CN" and not "Canadian National", a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to "Canada".

<H4> A "culture of fear" </H4>
In response to such high-profile derailments, the federal minister of transportation created an advisory panel to review the Railway Safety Act in February 2007. The panel's report in March 2008 identified a culture of fear and discipline at CN in particular that undermines the <a rel='nofollow' class='greylink1' href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/tcss/RSA_Review-Examen_LSF/FinalReport/chapter5.htm#5">safety management system</a> (SMS) that was introduced in 2001 to give rail companies more responsibility over safety.<br />
<br />
"CN's strict adherence to a rules-based approach, focused largely on disciplinary actions when mistakes are made, has instilled a ‘culture of fear and discipline’ and is counter to an effective safety management system. CN needs to acknowledge this openly and take concrete steps to improve," stated the panel.<br />
<br />
The goal of the safety management system was to move away from a compliance approach and toward a proactive approach in which companies assess and mitigate risks on their own initiative. The concept as applied to railways was born during the 1994 review of the Railway Safety Act and amendments to act were introduced in 1999 that added requirements for railway companies to develop and implement safety management systems.<br />
<br />
"The key for railway companies was to become more proactive, to refine their abilities to identify hazards, and to assess and mitigate risks. The need for companies to build a safety consciousness into their day-to-day operations was of paramount importance. This represented a shift from the traditional reactive approach of considering what had happened in a post-accident environment", stated the panel's report.<br />
<br />
The effectiveness of SMS depends on the safety culture within the organization. That's defined as a culture where safety is entrenched in the thinking of managers and employees alike, where open communication allows comparison and improvement of ongoing practices. It also depends on employee involvement, who can be "a company's prime source of information for the identification of hazards and assessment of mitigation strategies."<br />
<br />
However, the panel heard "...from many railway employees who felt neither involved nor informed about their company's safety management system. Rather, employees often described their organizational culture in such a way that the Panel could not reconcile it with an effective safety culture."<br />
<br />
The panel cited the example of passenger rail company <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("42704",this,"via_rail.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("42704")' href="/topics/VIA_Rail">Via Rail</a><span class="hp" id="m42704"><div class="hpHeader">VIA Rail</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i42704"></div>Via Rail Canada   is an independent crown corporation offering intercity passenger rail services in Canada. It is headquartered near Montreal Central Station at 3 Place Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec....</div><br></span>&nbsp;to illustrate a safety culture needed for SMS. Via's implementation of SMS is successful because the company makes safety management important to all employees. While there are certain cardinal rules that lead to disciplinary action if broken, Via also has processes to build openness and trust between managers and employees. "For instance, employees are observed at regular cycles, and corrective coaching takes place immediately when errors are observed," the panel report noted.<br />
<br />
In contrast, CN manages safety through an "antecedent, behaviour and consequences" process, which the panel said is based on a traditional rule and discipline model. It quoted <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("93332",this,"united_transportation_union.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("93332")' href="/topics/United_Transportation_Union">United Transportation Union</a><span class="hp" id="m93332"><div class="hpHeader">United Transportation Union</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i93332"></div>The United Transportation Union  is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a broad-based, transportation labor union representing about 125,000 active and retired railroad, bus, mass transit, and airline  workers in the United States....</div><br></span>&nbsp;leader Sylvia Leblanc's description of CN's attitude towards safety as one that "seems to be ‘blame and punish’ instead of ‘educate and correct.’ Frequently, employees involved in accidents… are simply blamed for errors without followup or root cause investigation. They are then punished without any other corrective action taken on the part of the railway to prevent reoccurrences."<br />
<br />
A management culture that relies on discipline, or threat of discipline, to enforce rules has "a tendency to instil fear, and to stifle employee participation and reporting," the panel report stated. "A significant mistrust of management develops. People stop communicating — and that can have a detrimental impact on safety."<br />

When CNR was first created, it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways, but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network.  For example, on December 3, 1920, CNR inaugurated the <i>Continental Limited</i>, which operated over four of its predecessors, as well as the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway.  The 1920s saw growth in passenger travel, and CNR inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services, such as radio, on its trains.<br />

The design has since proven popular...</div><br></span>&nbsp;locomotives. Recently acquired are the new EMD SD70M-2&nbsp;and GE ES44DC.<br />
<br />
Beginning in the early summer months of 2010, CN purchased a small order of C40-8's and C40-8W's from UP and BNSF, respectively. The intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative. CN has stayed firmly committed to conventional direct-current traction motors, instead of the new alternating-current motors being used by many railways in heavy-haul service.<br />
<br />
Comfort cab<br />
CN locomotives have long featured unique features, unlike the stock EMD and GE locomotives. CN introduced a wide-nosed four window <i>Comfort Cab,</i> the predecessor to the now standard <i>North American Safety Cab</i>, which is now standard on new North American freight locomotives.<br />
<br />
Ditch lights<br />
After a BC derailment, CN introduced ditch lights, lights mounted on or just below the anti-climbers on the front pilot of a locomotive. These are arranged in a "cross-eyed" configuration, to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, ditch lights have become standard features on all North American locomotives.<br />
<br />
Class and Marker lights<br />
CN continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years, up to as recently as the C40-8M and SD60F (which feature red, green and white class lights), and the first order C44-9WL locomotives which retained white class lights. More recently, CN has had red marker lights installed on their ES44DC and SD70M-2 locomotives, for use when the locomotives are in DPU service.<br />
<br />
Windshields<br />
CN's first few orders of ES44DC's, like their C44-9W's, feature "tear-drop" windshields, windshields with the outer lower corner dropped (like earlier SD70Is) as opposed to the standard rectangular GE windshield, to allow for better visibility.<br />
<br />
Headlights<br />
The first order of SD70M-2 locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab, while the second order (8800 series) dropped the headlight to the nose, and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab.<br />
<br />
Control stands<br />
While many railroads have ordered new "desktop" controls, where the controls are arranged on a desk&mdash;CN returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer, which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally. This arrangement makes reverse operation easier, and allows engineers to "put their feet up," without feeling stuck at a desk all day.<br />
<br />
Car body<br />
CN's General Motors SD50F, SD60F, and General Electric C40-8M feature a full-width car body that is tapered to allow for better rear visibility. This is referred to as a "Draper taper" after its creator. The first order of the GE C44-9 (2500–2522) was also initially an order for 18 locomotives with the full-width Draper Taper car body. They were changed to a standard long hood with a CN-style 4-window cab and the order was increased to 23 locomotives at the same price.<br />

<H3>CNR as a social and economic tool</H3>
It is generally accepted that government policy dictated CNR commercial decisions, whether such decisions were in the nation's interest, or in the political interest of the party in power.

<H3>Deregulation and recapitalization</H3>
Another problem that hobbled CNR was in the sheer number of low-volume branch railway lines, which did not produce sufficient traffic to pay for their operation.

One tactic that CNR perfected was to <i>demarket</i> a line by providing sufficiently poor service to its few customers, that those customers would turn to trucks for improved service and lower costs.  Once customers ceased to exist on a small branch line, the federal government would permit the line's abandonment.

From the creation of CNR in 1918 until its recapitalization in 1978, whenever the company posted a deficit, the federal government would assume those costs in the government budget.  The result of various governments using CNR as a vehicle for various social and economic policies was a subsidization running into billions of dollars over successive decades.  Following its 1978 recapitalization and changes in management, CN (name changed to <b>Canadian National Railway</b>, using the shortened acronym <b>CN</b> in 1960) started to operate much more efficiently, by assuming its own debt, improving accounting practices to allow depreciation of assets and to access financial markets for further capital.  Now operating as a for-profit Crown corporation, CN reported a profit in 11 of the 15 years from 1978 to 1992, paying $371 million in cash dividends (profit) to the federal government during this time.<br />

In CN's case, some of these branch lines were those it had been forced to absorb through federal government policies and outright patronage, while others were from the heady expansion era of rural branchlines in the 1920s and early 1930s and were considered obsolete following the development of local road networks.<br />

This was achieved largely through aggressive cuts to the company's bloated and inefficient management structure, widescale layoffs in its workforce and continued abandonment or sale of its branch lines.  In 1993 and 1994 the company experimented with a rebranding that saw the names <i>CN</i>, <i>Grand Trunk Western</i>, and <i>Duluth, Winnipeg, and Pacific</i> replaced under a collective <b>CN North America</b> moniker.  During this time, CPR and CN entered into negotiations regarding a possible merger of the two companies.  This was later rejected by the federal government, whereby CPR offered to purchase outright all of CN's lines from Ontario to Nova Scotia, while an unidentified U.S. railroad (rumoured to have been <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("18832",this,"burlington_northern_railroad.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("18832")' href="/topics/Burlington_Northern_Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a><span class="hp" id="m18832"><div class="hpHeader">Burlington Northern Railroad</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i18832"></div>The Burlington Northern Railroad  was a United States-based railroad company formed from a merger of four major U.S. railroads.

<H3>Retraction and expansion since privatization</H3>
Following the successful IPO, CN has recorded impressive gains in its stock price, largely through an aggressive network rationalization and purchase of newer more fuel-efficient locomotives.  Numerous branch lines were shed during the late 1990s across Canada, resulting in dozens of independent short line&nbsp;railway companies being established to operate former CN track that had been considered marginal.  This network rationalization resulted in a core east-west freight railway stretching from Halifax to Chicago and Toronto to Vancouver and Prince Rupert.  The railway also operated trains from Winnipeg to Chicago using trackage rights for part of the route south of Duluth.<br />

On December 24, 2008, the STB approved CN's purchase for $300 million of the principal lines of the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway&nbsp;Company (EJ&E) (reporting mark&nbsp;EJE) from US Steel Corp originally announced on September 27, 2007.   The STB's decision was to become effective on Jan. 23, 2009, with a closure of the transaction shortly thereafter. The EJ&E lines create a bypass around the western side of heavily congested Chicago-area rail hub and its conversion to use for mainline freight traffic is expected to alleviate substantial bottlenecks for both regional and intercontinental rail traffic subject to lengthy delays entering and exiting Chicago freight yards. The purchase of the lightly used EJ&E corridor was positioned by CN as a boon not only for its own business but for the efficiency of the entire US rail system.<br />

Since the Illinois Central purchase in 1998 CN has been increasingly focused on running a "scheduled freight railroad/railway", meeting on-time performance with rail industry-leading consistency.  This has resulted in improved shipper relations, as well as reduced the need for maintaining pools of surplus locomotives and freight cars.  CN has also undertaken a rationalization of its existing track network by removing double track sections in some areas and extending passing sidings in other areas.<br />

CN is also a rail industry leader in the employment of radio-control (R/C) for switching locomotives in yards, resulting in reductions to the number of yard workers required.

The train derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld; the report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called into question CN's quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels. In memory of the dead crewmen, two new stations on the line have been named after them (Davis and Thériault).<br />
<br />
About 9:04 a.m. central standard time on February 9, 2003, northbound Canadian National freight train M33371 derailed 22 of its 108 cars in Tamaroa, Illinois. Four of the derailed cars released methanol, and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire. Other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and vinyl chloride. Two cars containing hydrochloric acid, one car containing formaldehyde, and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire. About 850 residents were evacuated from the area within a 3 miles (4.8 km) radius of the derailment, which included the entire village of Tamaroa. Improper  placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars, where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that, because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions, rapidly progressed to rail failure.<br />

On May 14, 2003, a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near McBride, B.C., killing both crew members. Both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge, claiming it was unsafe. It was revealed that as far back as 1999, several bridge components had been reported as rotten, yet no repairs had been ordered by management. Eventually, the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously.<br />

Controversy arose again in Canadian political circles in 2003 following the company's decision to refer solely to its acronym "CN" and not "Canadian National", a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to "Canada".

<H4> A "culture of fear" </H4>
In response to such high-profile derailments, the federal minister of transportation created an advisory panel to review the Railway Safety Act in February 2007. The panel's report in March 2008 identified a culture of fear and discipline at CN in particular that undermines the <a rel='nofollow' class='greylink1' href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/tcss/RSA_Review-Examen_LSF/FinalReport/chapter5.htm#5">safety management system</a> (SMS) that was introduced in 2001 to give rail companies more responsibility over safety.<br />
<br />
"CN's strict adherence to a rules-based approach, focused largely on disciplinary actions when mistakes are made, has instilled a ‘culture of fear and discipline’ and is counter to an effective safety management system. CN needs to acknowledge this openly and take concrete steps to improve," stated the panel.<br />
<br />
The goal of the safety management system was to move away from a compliance approach and toward a proactive approach in which companies assess and mitigate risks on their own initiative. The concept as applied to railways was born during the 1994 review of the Railway Safety Act and amendments to act were introduced in 1999 that added requirements for railway companies to develop and implement safety management systems.<br />
<br />
"The key for railway companies was to become more proactive, to refine their abilities to identify hazards, and to assess and mitigate risks. The need for companies to build a safety consciousness into their day-to-day operations was of paramount importance. This represented a shift from the traditional reactive approach of considering what had happened in a post-accident environment", stated the panel's report.<br />
<br />
The effectiveness of SMS depends on the safety culture within the organization. That's defined as a culture where safety is entrenched in the thinking of managers and employees alike, where open communication allows comparison and improvement of ongoing practices. It also depends on employee involvement, who can be "a company's prime source of information for the identification of hazards and assessment of mitigation strategies."<br />
<br />
However, the panel heard "...from many railway employees who felt neither involved nor informed about their company's safety management system. Rather, employees often described their organizational culture in such a way that the Panel could not reconcile it with an effective safety culture."<br />
<br />
The panel cited the example of passenger rail company <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("24758",this,"via_rail.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("24758")' href="/topics/VIA_Rail">Via Rail</a><span class="hp" id="m24758"><div class="hpHeader">VIA Rail</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i24758"></div>Via Rail Canada   is an independent crown corporation offering intercity passenger rail services in Canada. It is headquartered near Montreal Central Station at 3 Place Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec....</div><br></span>&nbsp;to illustrate a safety culture needed for SMS. Via's implementation of SMS is successful because the company makes safety management important to all employees. While there are certain cardinal rules that lead to disciplinary action if broken, Via also has processes to build openness and trust between managers and employees. "For instance, employees are observed at regular cycles, and corrective coaching takes place immediately when errors are observed," the panel report noted.<br />
<br />
In contrast, CN manages safety through an "antecedent, behaviour and consequences" process, which the panel said is based on a traditional rule and discipline model. It quoted <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("75386",this,"united_transportation_union.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("75386")' href="/topics/United_Transportation_Union">United Transportation Union</a><span class="hp" id="m75386"><div class="hpHeader">United Transportation Union</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i75386"></div>The United Transportation Union  is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a broad-based, transportation labor union representing about 125,000 active and retired railroad, bus, mass transit, and airline  workers in the United States....</div><br></span>&nbsp;leader Sylvia Leblanc's description of CN's attitude towards safety as one that "seems to be ‘blame and punish’ instead of ‘educate and correct.’ Frequently, employees involved in accidents… are simply blamed for errors without followup or root cause investigation. They are then punished without any other corrective action taken on the part of the railway to prevent reoccurrences."<br />
<br />
A management culture that relies on discipline, or threat of discipline, to enforce rules has "a tendency to instil fear, and to stifle employee participation and reporting," the panel report stated. "A significant mistrust of management develops. People stop communicating — and that can have a detrimental impact on safety."<br />

When CNR was first created, it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways, but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network.  For example, on December 3, 1920, CNR inaugurated the <i>Continental Limited</i>, which operated over four of its predecessors, as well as the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway.  The 1920s saw growth in passenger travel, and CNR inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services, such as radio, on its trains.<br />
<br />

The design has since proven popular...</div><br></span>&nbsp;locomotives. Recently acquired are the new EMD SD70M-2&nbsp;and GE ES44DC.<br />
<br />
Beginning in the early summer months of 2010, CN purchased a small order of C40-8's and C40-8W's from UP and BNSF, respectively. The intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative. CN has stayed firmly committed to conventional direct-current traction motors, instead of the new alternating-current motors being used by many railways in heavy-haul service.<br />
<br />
Comfort cab<br />
CN locomotives have long featured unique features, unlike the stock EMD and GE locomotives. CN introduced a wide-nosed four window <i>Comfort Cab,</i> the predecessor to the now standard <i>North American Safety Cab</i>, which is now standard on new North American freight locomotives.<br />
<br />
Ditch lights<br />
After a BC derailment, CN introduced ditch lights, lights mounted on or just below the anti-climbers on the front pilot of a locomotive. These are arranged in a "cross-eyed" configuration, to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, ditch lights have become standard features on all North American locomotives.<br />
<br />
Class and Marker lights<br />
CN continued to use class lights on its locomotives for many years, up to as recently as the C40-8M and SD60F (which feature red, green and white class lights), and the first order C44-9WL locomotives which retained white class lights. More recently, CN has had red marker lights installed on their ES44DC and SD70M-2 locomotives, for use when the locomotives are in DPU service.<br />
<br />
Windshields<br />
CN's first few orders of ES44DC's, like their C44-9W's, feature "tear-drop" windshields, windshields with the outer lower corner dropped (like earlier SD70Is) as opposed to the standard rectangular GE windshield, to allow for better visibility.<br />
<br />
Headlights<br />
The first order of SD70M-2 locomotives had their headlights mounted on the cab, while the second order (8800 series) dropped the headlight to the nose, and also features added red marker lights mounted above the windshields on the cab.<br />
<br />
Control stands<br />
While many railroads have ordered new "desktop" controls, where the controls are arranged on a desk&mdash;CN returned earlier than most to the conventional control stand that most locomotive engineers prefer, which features a stand to the side of the engineer with controls that stick out horizontally. This arrangement makes reverse operation easier, and allows engineers to "put their feet up," without feeling stuck at a desk all day.<br />
<br />
Car body<br />
CN's General Motors SD50F, SD60F, and General Electric C40-8M feature a full-width car body that is tapered to allow for better rear visibility. This is referred to as a "Draper taper" after its creator. The first order of the GE C44-9 (2500–2522) was also initially an order for 18 locomotives with the full-width Draper Taper car body. They were changed to a standard long hood with a CN-style 4-window cab and the order was increased to 23 locomotives at the same price.<br />
