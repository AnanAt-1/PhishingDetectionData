<H3>Political career</H3>
After joining the Socialist party and running unsuccessfully for the state legislature in 1914, he abandoned the Socialists and criss-crossed the state in a borrowed Model-T Ford, signing up members in a new political party called the Nonpartisan League. His message resonated with the grievances of small farmers against the exploitative big interests: the Minneapolis grain merchants, the railroads, and the eastern banks.<br />

However, the political winds soon turned. Newspapers and business groups portrayed the NPL as socialist, and the NPL's lack of political experience led to infighting and corruption.

Townley paid his $25 fine and gave him train fare home.<br />

Finding himself increasingly irrelevant to NPL affairs, he drifted from one failed project to another.
