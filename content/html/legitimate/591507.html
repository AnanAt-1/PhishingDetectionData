The Poynter Journalism Prizes named him 2024’s Innovator of The Year for his “bold new approach” to digital storytelling. He currently focuses on stories that explore culture and humanity with an emphasis on mental health. His influential storytelling about teen suicide resulted in $6 million in new state funding to combat depression. His 10 years covering education led to a new state law mandating stronger background checks for school employees and the resignation or termination of multiple educators who hid improper conduct. The Online News Association, Education Writers Association and Society For Features Journalism have recognized his work. Prior to joining NJ Advance Media in 2014, he worked at The Morning Call in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He led an investigation into a 30-year-old cold case that spurred a fresh look by prosecutors and culminated in an indictment for murder. He graduated from Penn State University with a degree in journalism.","bio":"Senior reporter covering everything New Jersey.","mt_author_id":"12111803","firstName":"Adam","twitter":"realAdamClark","podcasts":[],"books":[],"awards":[],"_id":"adamclark","last_updated_date":"2025-01-29T16:47:45.634Z","byline":"Adam Clark | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com","email":"aclark@njadvancemedia.com","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8"}]},"subtype":"article","first_publish_date":"2025-05-10T15:00:00Z","additional_properties":{"is_published":true,"publish_date":"2025-05-10T15:00:00Z","has_published_copy":true},"last_updated_date":"2025-05-10T19:13:12.722Z","publishing":{"scheduled_operations":{"unpublish_edition":[],"publish_edition":[]}},"owner":{"sponsored":false,"id":"advancelocal"},"workflow":{"status_code":1},"promo_items":{"basic":{"owner":{"sponsored":false,"id":"advancelocal"},"address":{"locality":"PERTH AMBOY","region":"NJ"},"syndication":{},"auth":{"1":"42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a"},"caption":"Grave of Thomas Mundy Peterson, at St. Peter's Episcopal Church cemetery in Perth Amboy.","source":{"system":"photo center","edit_url":"","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"}},"taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","version":"0.10.9","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg","licensable":false,"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"SL","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"VIC YEPELLO","type":"author","byline":"VIC YEPELLO"}]},"subtitle":"The single greatest thing about every Central Jersey town","width":1387,"creditIPTC":"SL","_id":"XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a","iptc_source":"NJNP MX","iptc_job_identifier":"MERbc793ab274037bc5ad71bfccc0fd9","keywords":["merlin"],"proxyUrl":"/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a","takenOn":"2004-09-24T19:05:38Z","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a","ingestionMethod":"manual","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a&width=300","version":0,"originalName":"thomas mundy peterson vic yepello .jpeg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","restricted":false,"template_id":7,"galleries":[]},"created_date":"2021-07-12T18:52:23Z","last_updated_date":"2021-07-12T18:52:23Z","slug":"MXTHOM01","height":1898,"image_type":"photograph","resized_urls":{"large":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a&width=1280&quality=90","medium":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a&width=800&quality=90","small":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a&width=500&quality=90","x_small":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XIBRDN5AEZHGHGTDS3SEGPSFLA.jpeg?auth=42ed9e7e465b935ecb6935ff4a6ed1dfdb7a124eab8f93e245121f7275e8b67a&width=180&quality=90"}}},"canonical_url":"/news/2025/05/american-history-could-be-buried-beneath-this-nj-soil-will-the-kushners-pave-it-over.html","distributor":{"name":"advancelocal","category":"staff","subcategory":""},"version":"0.10.10","canonical_website":"nj","revision":{"editions":["default"],"parent_id":"QXZ6FQXGMZEHTKMHS3OM7SYILE","published":true,"branch":"default","revision_id":"4KUEELI5VBGPTFNB5NSMIXEYZ4"},"planning":{"story_length":{"character_count_actual":4549,"inch_count_actual":6,"word_count_actual":757,"line_count_actual":37}},"display_date":"2025-05-10T15:00:00Z","headlines":{"tablet":"","print":"","meta_title":"","native":"","web":"","mobile":"","basic":"American history could be buried beneath this N.J. soil.
