<a name="numbered"></a>Forcing Lynx to associate a number with each
individual link will completely revolutionize the way you perceive the
web.  Linearly listed links will no longer present a near-impassable
sound barrier, and when you are listening to a news story or a hypertext
book or manual which contains embedded links, you'll a) know that they
exist, b) know exactly where they are, c) be able to follow them and
listen to the explanatory or complementary information they contain, and
d) return to the body of the document and resume reading where you left
off.<p>

<!-- There are 2 ways for you to set lynx to generate bracketed numbers
immediately to the left of every link. The first, and by far the
easiest, is to use Lynx's Options Menu, the other is to manually edit the
.lynxrc file--the hidden file in which the lynx options
you set are stored. -->

To force Lynx to associate a number with every hyperlink, using the
<strong>Lynx Options Menu</strong>,

<dl>
<dt><strong>step one:</strong>  type 'o' to raise the options menu.
<br>
<br>

<dt><strong>step two:</strong> press 'k' to activate the<br><br>
<tab indent="12">"K)eypad as arrows or Numbered links"
<br>
<br>
field.  there are 2 values for this setting:<br><br>

<tab indent="12">"numbers act as arrows" and "links are numbered"
<br>
<br>

<dt><strong>step 3:</strong> use the spacebar to toggle between these 
values.  pause after you press the spacebar so that your synthesizer has a
chance to announce the current setting.  when you hear your synth say
"links are numbered", press 'enter'.
<br>
<br>

<dt><strong>optional step 3.1:</strong>
At this point, you can press 'u' to activate the "U)ser mode" field and
press the spacebar until you hear your synth say "advanced", and then
press 'enter'.  (There are three values for this option: NOVICE (the
default), INTERMEDIATE, and ADVANCED.)
<br>

<dd><em>Why change the user mode setting?</em> When the user mode is set
to NOVICE, Lynx displays two extra lines of keystroke prompts at the 
bottom of the screen.  While these prompts are designed to provide the
user with a quick visual reminder of Lynx's basic commands, screen-readers
have an annoying tendency to repeatedly read these prompts every time you
press a key.  Changing the user mode setting, therefore, not only
eliminates this aural annoyance, and leaves more room for pages to be
displayed, but it allows you to listen to the URL of the currently chosen
link--an invaluable aid when navigating a site comprised of alt-tagless
links.  But, you say, "I <em>am</em> a novice and i might not remember all
of Lynx's navigation keystrokes without the on-screen prompts!"  Just
remember that you can always press '<strong>k</strong>' at any point
during a Lynx session, and Lynx will display a complete keymap, which not
only lists all of the valid keystrokes available using your ISP's version
of Lynx, but does so in a far speech-friendlier manner than when the
prompts are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
<br>
<br>

<dt><strong>step 4:</strong>   exit the lynx options menu by generating a 
greater-than sign.  (On most IBM-compatible keyboards, you generate a
greater-than symbol by holding down the shift key and typing a period.)
<dd>Exiting the Lynx Options Menu with a greater-than forces Lynx to save this
setting in your .lynxrc file as a default setting, so that every time you
subsequently load Lynx, all links will be numbered.  When you want to
follow a link, simply type the number associated with the link you want
to follow, press enter, and Lynx will follow that link.
</dl>

<!-- The second method of forcing Lynx to associate a number with every
hyperlink is to manually edit your .lynxrc file. (note the period before
the 'l')  This is a hidden file, which resides in your remote home
directory, and which contains your Lynx options settings.  It is a plain
text file, which contains copious commentaries on each setting and each
possible value for that setting. -->

<!-- In order to edit the .lynxrc file, you first need to read it into a
buffer using an online editor.  (Translated into plain English, this 
means invoke your favorite online editor, such as PICO, EMACS, or VI, to
edit the .lynxrc file.  Note that any line preceded by a number/pound
sign (a hash mark to you Brits!) is a comment, and does not effect the
execution of the file.  The options settings for all of the options defined 
in the .lynxrc file, take the following form: 
 
option_name=OPTION_VALUE_IN_CAPS

Note that there are no spaces between any of the words, nor between the 
option, the equals sign, or the value.<p>

To set Lynx to associate a bracketed number with each hyperlink, use your
editor's search feature to locate the following text-string:

keypad_mode=

The default setting for this option is keypad_mode=NUMBERS_AS_ARROWS
Use the search command to place the cursor at the equals sign, move
the cursor forward one character, and delete to the end of the line.
Then, in all capital letters, type:

LINKS_ARE_NUMBERED

Once you have made this change, you can either issue the editor's
save-and-exit command, or, if you also want to change the User mode setting, 
use your editor's search feature to locate the following text-string:

user_mode

The default setting for this option is user_mode=NOVICE.  Use the search
command to place the cursor at the equals sign, move the cursor forward
one character, and delete to the end of the line. Then, in all capital
letters, type:

ADVANCED

Once you have made this change, issue the editor's save-and-exit command. -->

<!-- what follows is a testament to my stupidity, and a tribute
to alexandre khalil's patience and intelligence:  

	the information about setting lynx to display numbers that was once
	here disappeared on december 13, 1996 due to an all-too-human error...
	it will be replaced sometime after sunday, 15 december, unless this
	system was backed up in the last 24 hours...

thankfully, it was -->
