FRANTE HH. DUNTON,

EDITOR DUNTON’S SPIRIT OF THE TURF, 
AND AUTHOR OF “HOW TO TRAIN TROTTERS.”’ 


PRICE, THREE DOLLARS. 


FEB 3 1890” 


Sass 
WASHINGTON: 


Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1889, 
By FRANK H. Dunton, 
In the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D, C. 


— 


Announcement. 


The Dunton Register is issued in no spirit of rivalry 
with similar publications. There are aspects in which 
it stands without a rival, occupying a field wholly its 
own. It differs from other Registers in that it admits 
animals only upon their individual merit. Animals 
that have performed in 2:30 themselves, or that have 
produced such performers; holding that there is no vir- 
tuein relationship. ‘‘Brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, 
and aunts” have thus been weeded out. In 1881 a work 
was attempted which approached this one insome re- 
spects; but like all of its imitators, it embraced too many 
conditions. Had it employed only three instead of six 
rules, the fate of that book, best known as the ‘‘Ken- 
tucky Stud Book”, might, and we believe would, have 
been averted. Upon the ruins of the ‘Kentucky Stud 
Book” sprang up the publication known as the ‘‘Stan- 
dard Register”. The fault with the latter is, that quite 
too much dross for the refined gold is found therein, 
giving a fictitious value to the dross. Every animal in 
The Dunton Register, has a true value based upon its 
own pelformance or creative powers, giving the only 
criterion that can be safely used by the student of the 
breeding problem. Having sifted the good from the 
bad, The Dunton Register becomes the cheapest and 
easiest means of obtaining valuable knowledge of the 
trotting horse. 

The Dunton Register, I may say, is indebted to an 
expressed desire of a large number of the readers of 
Dunton’s Spirit of the Turf, for its origin; persons who 
looked for a stud book freed from the machinations of 
unscrupulous editors, planned in the interest of hobbies 
and theories. With these acknowledgments, invoking 
the lenient criticism of my contemporaries of the press, 
and thanking good friends for their kindly interest and 
indulgence, I submit this work to the public.
