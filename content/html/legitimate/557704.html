<P><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September of 2000 I was privileged
to debate the well-known, self professed &quot;progressive creationist&quot;
Dr. Hugh Ross for 3 hours. The debate was aired on the John Ankerberg
(www.ankerberg.com) show nine weeks in a row starting in September
of 2000 and is now available by special arrangement with Dr. Ankerberg
from our ministry, CSE, www.drdino.com for $78 as a video series.
This debate was my first encounter with Dr. Ross and I look forward
to debating him again any time in the future if he is willing.
I believe Dr. Ross is a sincere man who is convinced he must blend
scripture with the theories currently being taught in science
class. As any discerning Christian should know, sincerity and
being a nice man has nothing to do with having correct doctrine.
Some of the prophets of Baal were probably nice people also. Some
of Dr. Ross's doctrine is heretical in my opinion (and the opinion
of scores of other Christians) and needs to be exposed before
it does further damage to the body of Christ. Rom. 3:4 &quot;yea,
let God be true, but every man a liar;&quot;</P>

<P>Many major ministries have endorsed (to varying degrees) Dr.
Ross such as: <BR>
Bill Bright -- Campus Crusade for Christ <BR>
R.C. Sproul -- Ligonier Ministries <BR>
Norman Geisler -- Southern Evangelical Seminary <BR>
Harold Lindsell -- former editor of Christianity Today <BR>
Don Richardson -- author of Peace Child and Eternity in Their
Heart <BR>
Ralph D. Winter -- US Center for World Mission <BR>
Earl Radmacher -- former president of Western Conservative Baptist
Seminary <BR>
Walter Kaiser -- Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and editor
of Christianity Today <BR>
Stan Oakes -- Christian Leadership Ministries, Campus Crusade
for Christ <BR>
Jim Barney -- InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of Canada <BR>
Ted Martin -- International School of Theology, Campus Crusade
for Christ <BR>
John Ankerberg -- The John Ankerberg Show <BR>
James Dobson - Focus on the Family <BR>
Scores of pastors and leaders of churches across America</P>

<P>The fact that so many Christians have been taken in by Dr.
Ross's obviously unscriptural teachings is a sad indicator of
how the evolution propaganda of the last 200 years has infiltrated
modern Christianity. To refute the many doctrinal errors of Dr.
Ross in detail would require a huge book and others have already
done this job well so I will only reprint some of their comments
adding a few thoughts of my own.</P>

<P>Many people have argued that Hugh Ross is such a nice man and
remains calm in the face of criticism. Based on my brief experience
with him I would agree, and these are great qualities to have,
however, I would like to point out that being a nice man has nothing
to do with having correct doctrine. Many &quot;nice people&quot;
have founded cults and were reported to be humble, considerate
and intelligent yet they had wrong doctrine. Many mean spirited
people such as Elijah who slew the prophets of Baal had right
doctrine. It is important to constantly keep in mind, &quot;thus
sayeth the Lord&quot; in this debate and not be swayed by a person
being &quot;nice&quot; or sounding &quot;intellectual&quot;.</P>

<P>Some have asked why I would debate Hugh Ross since he is a
fellow Bible believing Christian. I know he claims to be a Bible
believing Christian but his doctrine does not match the scriptures.
Isaac of old was deceived because he went by the feelings (the
wool on the hands of Jacob) and not the word (the voice of Esau).
Many today fall for the same trap. It is always right to oppose
error even if found in a brother.</P>

<P>Having read much of Dr. Ross's material, I must join many others
in their observation that he may have only a head knowledge of
Christianity having accepted the Bible intellectually but has
not come through the door of repentance. See. John 10:1-14. <B>Paul
(Saul) had many &quot;Christian&quot; qualities but was lost.</B>
Phil. 3:4 &quot;If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof
he might trust in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day,
of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of
the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; Concerning zeal,
persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in
the law, blameless.&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Ross's testimony, in his own words is quite revealing.
After telling us how he read through the Bible finding that it
supported the big bang theory and what he was learning in his
university courses he says,</P>

<P>&quot;How could I not trust this book's message and the One
who sent it with such supernatural precision through human messengers?
With some delays and more than a little wrestling with personal
pride, I did make a transfer of trust, inviting God, the Creator
of the vast cosmos, to be my God, and Master of my destiny, through
Jesus Christ, His Son.&quot; The Genesis Question p. 18.</P>

<P>As I read this it seemed to not tell of genuine repentance,
turning from sin and placing saving faith in Jesus blood to pay
for sins but rather pride and self-reliance. I hope for his sake
that I am wrong in my evaluation. James tells us that the devils
believe and tremble, James 2:19.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross's ministry is called Reasons to Believe. Having studied
his teachings, I have joined the host of others who ask, &quot;Is
it reasons to believe the Bible or reasons to believe Hugh Ross?</P>

<P>It has often been the responsibility of followers of God to
expose false doctrine. There is no way to do this and still appear
to be &quot;nice&quot; people as the following examples show:</P>

<P>In Mk. 4:2 Jesus told us the key to all parables is the parable
of the sower. Mt. 13 - The wheat and the <B>tares</B> grew together
and looked alike, but one was not right. Many who name the name
of Christ will hear, &quot;depart from me. I never knew you.&quot;
(I am told that tares look like wheat but are poison and refuse
to &quot;bow their head&quot; as wheat does when it is ripe.)</P>

<P>Romans 16:17 warns us to: <B>&quot;mark them which cause divisions</B>
and offenses contrary to the doctrine, which ye have learned;
and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus
Christ, but their own belly; and <B>by good words and fair speeches
deceive</B> the hearts of the simple.&quot; I feel this applies
to Dr. Ross. His doctrine has cast a stumbling block before many
(Rev. 2:14) and caused much division in the church and God hates
it.</P>

<P><B>Azariah the priest withstood King Uzziah</B> when he went
beyond the bounds and offered a sacrifice in II Chron. 26:19.
Hugh's doctrine goes beyond scripture and needs to be withstood.
<B>Paul withstood Peter</B> in Gal. 2:11 when Peter was wrong.
<B>Alexander the coppersmith</B> caused harm to the gospel in
II Tim. 2:14. Jesus instructed us to beware of <B>false doctrine</B>
even from religious people like the Pharisees in Mt. 16:12.</P>

<P>I Kgs. 18:26 &quot;And they took the bullock which was given
them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from
morning even until noon, saying, <B>O Baal, hear us.</B> But there
was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the
altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah
mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is
talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure
he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And <B>they cried aloud, and
cut themselves</B> after their manner with knives and lancets,
till the blood gushed out upon them. 40 - And Elijah said unto
them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And
they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon,
and slew them there.&quot;</P>

<P>Elijah did not look very tolerant of the beliefs of others
that day, did he?</P>

<P>Pro. 6:16 - &quot;These six things doth the LORD hate: yea,
seven are an abomination unto him:&quot; 17 - &quot;A proud look,
a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,&quot; 18 -
&quot;An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be
swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies,
and he that soweth discord among brethren.&quot;</P>

<P>Gal.2: 11 - &quot;But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood
him to the face, because he was to be blamed.&quot;</P>

<P>Acts 18: 24 - &quot;And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at
Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came
to Ephesus.&quot; 25 - &quot;This man was instructed in the way
of the Lord; and being <B>fervent in the spirit,</B> he spake
and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the
baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue:
whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them,
and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.&quot; [Dr.
Ross is certainly eloquent also but his doctrine in wrong.]</P>

<P>I Sam. 15: 22 - &quot;And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great
delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice
of the LORD? Behold, <B>to obey is better than sacrifice,</B>
and to hearken than the fat of rams.&quot; 23 - &quot;For rebellion
is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and
idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he
hath also rejected thee from being king.&quot; 24 - &quot;And
Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed
the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the
people, and obeyed their voice.&quot;</P>

<P>Matthew 15:6-9 - &quot;Thus have ye made the commandment of
God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did
Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto
me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their
heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, <B>teaching
for doctrines the commandments of men.</B> 12 - &quot;Then came
his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that <B>the Pharisees
were offended,</B> after they heard this saying? But he answered
and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted,
shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the
blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the
ditch.&quot;</P>

<P>Sadducees - Mt. 22:23 - &quot;The same day came to him the
Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked
him,&quot; 24 - &quot;Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die,
having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise
up seed unto his brother.&quot; 25 - &quot;Now there were with
us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife,
deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
29 - &quot;Jesus answered and said unto them, <B>Ye do err,</B>
not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.&quot;</P>

<P><B>[KH] Below are the miscellaneous notes I collected before
my encounter with Hugh Ross. Scores of people have contributed
to this section. I especially appreciate Dr. Danny Faulkner and
James Sundquist for allowing me to use their many insightful comments.
I will try to edit out duplicate comments and edit this section
down as time permits, but I felt getting this information available
now in any form was better than waiting. So many have been and
are being deceived by Dr. Ross's doctrine. Please forgive the
disconnected thoughts below and glean what you can.</B></P>

<P><B>Miscellaneous Notes</B></P>

<P><B>Local Flood?<BR>
</B><BR>
One of Dr. Ross's false teachings is that the flood of Noah was
only a local event. If he admitted the flood was world wide as
the Bible teaches, it would have wiped out any evidence of the
&quot;billions of years&quot; he believes in. If the flood were
just a local event, why would God tell Noah to build the huge
boat and stay in there for a year with all the animals? Why not
tell Noah to move? Why didn't the people migrate all over the
world if the penguins made it to South Pole? Did others survive
so that we are not all descendants of Noah's family? Gen. 9:19
&quot;These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
earth overspread.&quot;</P>

<P>1. He says that God did not alter physics of his Creation.
This is an amazing statement, because every time a miracle was
performed, God dramatically altered the physics on earth. Example,
when he cursed the earth, He changed the physics. The Israelites
in the Wilderness wore shoes and clothes that NEVER wore out.
When he turned the water to wine, he changed the physics. Regarding
life. The Bible states that life is in the blood. <BR>
Plants don't have blood, so they don't have life. And as you stated,
God destroyed everything wherein there is the breath of life.
Plants also don't have breath. Finally, Genesis states that Eve
is the mother of ALL living. Doesn't all mean all? Therefore,
there were NO living humans born prior to Eve (Adam was not born
but created). One more point. If Christ is the last or second
Adam, then Adam must be the first man. Once again, Adam could
not have antecedents. If he did then Christ is the 3rd Adam...or
4th...or millionth.</P>

<P>Most early Church Fathers did take Genesis literally and believed
the days to be normal days. Some &quot;Christians&quot; of that
day like St. Augustine wrote that the six days were not literal
six days. But St. Augustine was WRONG not only about the Creation
Week, but he also spiritualized away all of the Book of Revelation
and Paul's Scripture in Romans... that the literal promises for
Israel now applied to the Church. This kind of theology paved
the way to the Holocaust.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>- Hugh Ross (born 1945) is president and founder of Reasons
  to Believe, Inc., a Progressive Creationist ministry located
  in Pasadena, California. Yet, Reasons To Believe claims to be
  &quot;an organization dedicated to showing how the latest scientific
  discoveries point to the God of the Bible, the Creator. Reasons
  To Believe was founded in 1986 with the desire to reach the secular
  scientific community with the truth of the Gospel. Today Reasons
  To Believe has 20 full time staff and 60 volunteers dedicated
  to sharing the joy of Christ through the latest scientific discoveries&quot;
  (Reasons to Believe Internet web site--7/16/96). Ross has a Ph.D.
  in Astronomy from the University of Toronto, and is the former
  Minister of Evangelism at the Sierra Madre Congregational Church.
  Ross has authored three books, two of which have become very
  controversial, The Fingerprint of God (1989) and Creation and
  Time (1994).</P>
  <P>- Dr. Ross is a professing Christian currently in full-time,
  non-denominational ministry dealing with apologetics, especially
  Bible and science issues. Ross is perhaps the most visible spokesman
  for Progressive Creationism, a belief which opposes both atheistic
  evolutionism and historic Christianity's understanding of Biblical
  creationism. At best, then, Ross is a theistic evolutionist.
  He has become increasingly well-known as he has appeared on many
  &quot;Christian&quot; radio and television programs and spoken
  before numerous audiences (see list above). Ross packages his
  beliefs in a way that appears Biblically conservative and evangelical;
  thus, Ross prominently displays endorsements of his books from
  many respected evangelicals (so-called) (see list above).</P>
  <P>- Few people (even pastors) have the time or background necessary
  to deal effectively with Progressive Creationism's/Ross's claims.
  Many have felt intimidated and confused by the scientific claims
  of its supporters and their insistence that the Bible supports
  their view. But Ross's views contrast sharply with those of fundamentalist,
  evangelical Christians who accept a literal, six-day Creation
  and a young Earth. Moreover, in some cases, Ross's stand on foundational
  Biblical issues is heretical at best and neo-orthodox at worst
  (see numbers 2, 4, and 11 below). The following documented listing
  of Ross's teachings has been compiled from the work of a variety
  of Bible-science organizations:</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1.</B> Origin of the Universe (the Big Bang). Dr. Ross teaches
that the universe is 17 billion years old, plus or minus 3 billion
years. He maintains that the universe began with a God-engineered
&quot;Big Bang,&quot; and that the stars and planets evolved into
their present form and positions during these billions of years--eventually
resulting in the formation of Earth approximately 5 billion years
ago.</P>

<P>Ross claims that the Big Bang Theory has been &quot;undeniably&quot;
proven, and he has taught the theory so strongly that if it were
abandoned by the majority of scientists, as one day may be the
case, it will be a major embarrassment to his ministry. [See:
Creation and Time , pp. 91-118, 129; The Fingerprint of God ,
first edition (1989), pp. 158-159; Hugh Ross, &quot;Why Big Bang
Opponents Never Say Die,&quot; Facts &amp; Faith newsletter, Vol.
4, No. 4 (Winter 1990-91).] <BR>
[NOTE: God's Word provides lists of generations between Adam and
Jesus Christ. Even if there were a few gaps in the lists, it would
be absurd to accept insertions of tens of thousands (or even millions)
of years in the genealogy. Actually, the great majority of scientific
age estimation methods indicate a young earth. See Creation Science
Evangelism video tape #1. Dr. Ross's bias is apparent in his willingness
to accept only those scientific methods that agree with his belief
in billions of years. In the final analysis, none of man's scientific
age estimation methods can be considered foolproof, young or old.
We would prefer to stick with the testimony of the only eyewitness,
God.]</P>

<P><B>2.</B> Origin of the Stars and Planets (order of creation).
In contrast to Scripture, Dr. Ross teaches that the sun, moon,
and stars were created even before the first &quot;day&quot; (i.e.,
&quot;in the beginning&quot;), rather than on the fourth day as
stated in Genesis. He says that most of the stars existed long
before Earth's creation; i.e., that approximately 10-15 billion
years of stellar evolution occurred prior to the Creation Week.
(Note: Thus, he claims that not all of the heavens and earth were
created in six days as the Bible plainly states in Ex. 20:11.)
Dr. Ross claims that Genesis 1 describes Creation from the point
of view of one standing on the earth, and that the sun, moon,
and stars did not become visible until the fourth day. He believes
the stars were not created instantaneously, but they evolved by
the physical laws of nature put into place by God: &quot;This
entire process of stellar evolution is by natural process alone.
We do not have to invoke Divine intervention at any stage in the
history of the life-cycle of the stars that we observe.&quot;
According to Dr. Ross, many stars had long ceased to exist by
the time of Adam's creation: &quot;The planets and life-essential
elements are the burned-up remains --i.e., ashes--of [the Big
Bang's] hydrogen gas.&quot; [See: The Fingerprint of God, first
edition (1989), pp. 158-159, 165-169; Creation and Time , pp.
52, 131, 148-151; Hugh Ross, &quot;Why Big Bang Opponents Never
Say Die,&quot; Facts &amp; Faith newsletter, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Winter
1990-91); Hugh Ross, &quot;Species Development: Natural Process
or Divine Action&quot; audiotape, (Reasons to Believe, 1990).]</P>

<P><B>3.</B> Creation Week (not days, but billions of years).
Dr. Ross teaches that the Creation of the heavens and Earth took
place about 4.6 billion years ago during six long, partially-overlapping
periods, not 24 hour type days. [See: The Fingerprint of God,
first edition (1989), pp. 146-155.] &quot;Based on scientific
dating records, each of God's creation days is several hundred
million years long.&quot; [Hugh Ross, Genesis 1: A Scientific
Perspective, Revised Edition (Sierra Madre, California: Wiseman
Productions, 1983), p 11.] Dr. Ross teaches that we are currently
in the 7th Day--a day that began after God made Adam and Eve,
and which will not end until the beginning of the New Heavens
and New Earth. [See: Creation and Time, pp. 59, 91-118.]</P>

<P><B>4.</B> Origin of Death (not a result of sin). Dr. Ross strongly
teaches that the existence of physical death in our world is not
due to Adam's sin. He claims that death was created by God as
a basic part of earthly existence since the beginning of life,
and that physical death and animal predation existed for billions
of years throughout the world prior to Adam's sin. (Note: Would
not this belief cause the doctrines of sin and salvation to fall?
If death and bloodshed preceded Adam's rebellion against God,
then what are &quot;the wages of sin&quot; and how did the entrance
of sin change things? And if death proceeded sin, then death is
not the penalty for sin, and Christ's death on the cross accomplished
nothing! Thus, any scheme that places death prior to man's sin
is a False Gospel! ) [See: The Fingerprint of God, first edition
(1989), pp. 153-155, 159-160; &quot;Reasons to Believe,&quot;
90-second radio spots No. 47 &amp; 48 (February 1991); Hugh Ross:
&quot;Focus on the Family&quot; radio program, April 18, 1991.]</P>

<P><B>5.</B> No Original Paradise. Dr. Ross does not believe the
Garden of Eden was free of death, pain, suffering, or degeneration--a
world created in perfection. According to Dr. Ross, there was
no original paradise, except in the sense that Adam walked with
God, experienced less pain than we do, and experienced no sin
initially. He believes that death and degeneration existed in
the beginning and have continued for millions of years. He also
teaches that neither the fall to sin nor the Flood resulted in
significant physical changes in Nature. Dr. Ross claims that our
planet has always been subject to catastrophes and violent predation.
He says that long before Adam, there were supernovas and collisions
with meteorites that wiped out millions of animals and caused
&quot;mass extinction.&quot; There were floods, hurricanes, tornadoes,
harmful mutations, and diseases of all sorts. In other words,
God used &quot;random, wasteful, inefficiencies&quot; to create
the world into which Adam was placed. [Creation and Time, pp.
55, 65-69, 88; Hugh Ross, &quot;Species Development: Natural Process
or Divine Action&quot; audiotape, tape 2, side 1 (Reasons to Believe,
1990).] <BR>
<BR>
[NOTE: According to the Bible, death (both physical and spiritual)
entered the world through man's sin (Gen. 2:17; 3:19, Rom. 5:12;
6:23; 1 Cor. 15:20-23). The Bible indicates that our world is
very different from the one which God created and pronounced as
&quot;very good.&quot; The Bible clearly says animals were not
created carnivorous; God originally commanded them to eat plants--see
Gen. 1:29-30, etc. Because of sin, God cursed the ground and physical
creation (Gen. 3:17).</P>

<P>Scripture says the whole creation has been affected by man's
sin, causing it to groan as it awaits freedom from bondage to
decay (Rom. 8:20-22). The global Flood judgment changed earth
even more (Gen. 8:21). One day God will restore paradise. Once
again the lion will lie down with the lamb. (Is 11:6)]</P>

<P><B>6.</B> Origin of Species: Progressive Creations (amoeba
to man). Dr. Ross defines Progressive Creationism as &quot;the
hypothesis that God has increased the complexity of life on earth
by successive creations of new life forms over billions of years
while miraculously changing the earth to accommodate the new life.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
[Quote is from &quot;Dinosaurs and Hominids&quot; audiotape, Reasons
to Believe (1990).] In fact, Dr. Ross accepts a history of life
very similar to that outlined by Evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould.
Gould's Punctuated Equilibrium theory describes slow progress
by natural means, interspersed with mass extinctions and sudden,
rapid advances. For Dr. Ross, the advances are the result of a
multitude of Divine miracles. He seems to accept far more miraculous
creations (&quot;hundreds of millions of species of life&quot;)
than most Progressive Creationists when he claims to &quot;deny
any significant biological evolution over time scales long or
short.&quot;</P>

<P>Elsewhere, Dr. Ross seems to have a different attitude when
he says that &quot;many of the changes that take place within
the biological arena [are] by natural process, natural selection,
mutational advance.&quot; He teaches that for billions of years
before Adam, major disasters befell the animals, including supernovas,
asteroid impacts, etc. As a result, animals frequently became
extinct, never to be seen by man. God stepped in many times to
create replacements or improved models--sometimes completely abandoning
entire groups of animals, changing the previous course of life
on earth.</P>

<P>Eventually, God created Adam and Eve from the dust, but after
the majority of the earth's history had already taken place. The
order of creation was from amoeba to man. Thus, for Progressive
Creationists, creation was an extremely long process interspersed
with numerous miraculous events, which produced new forms of animals
and plants. [See: Hugh Ross, &quot;Open Line&quot; radio program
(Moody, April 1994); Creation and Time, p. 83; &quot;Species Development,&quot;
audiotape; &quot;Dinosaurs and hominids,&quot; audiotape (Reasons
to Believe, 1990).]</P>

<P><B>7.</B> Hominids (man-like creatures ). Dr. Ross: &quot;Bipedal,
tool-using, large-brained hominids roamed the earth at least as
long ago as one million years. New evidence indicates that the
hominid species may have gone extinct before, or as a result of,
the appearance of man. Starting about 2 to 4 million years ago,
God began creating man-like mammals.&quot; Although some of these
creatures looked completely human (e.g., Cro-Magnon, Neanderthal),
&quot;used tools, buried their dead, and painted on cave walls,&quot;
they were actually animals and &quot;had no spirits.&quot; He
has stated that the major difference between men and hominids
is that humans were &quot;the first spirit creatures.&quot; [See:
The Fingerprint of God, first edition (1989), pp. 159-160; &quot;Genesis
One, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen,&quot; (Reasons to Believe, 1989);
Creation and Time, p. 88, etc.</P>

<P><B>8.</B> Origin of Man. Dr. Ross teaches that man was created
by God from the dust of the Earth, but not on the last of six
24-hour type days, as the Bible teaches. Humans were created somewhere
between 6,000 and 60,000 years ago-- after the majority of Earth's
supposed history had already taken place, and after billions of
years of animal life and death. [Note: The Bible says that &quot;from
the beginning of the creation (not 17 billion years after the
beginning) God made them male and female.&quot; (Mark 10:6)] Dr.
Ross: &quot;If the time since the creation of the universe were
scaled down to a single year, the whole of human history would
be less than one minute.&quot; [See: The Fingerprint of God, first
edition (1989), pp. 159-160, 178-179; Creation and Time, pp. 140-141;
Hugh Ross, &quot;Open Line&quot; radio program with Chris Fabry
(Moody, April and May, 1994).]</P>

<P><B>9.</B> Pre-Flood World. According to Dr. Ross, the pre-Flood
world was basically identical to the post-Flood world--same geology
and paleontology, no significant environmental changes. He claims
that rain began during the second Creation Day, when the modern
atmosphere was created billions of years before the creation of
Adam. (Note: The Bible specifically says there was no rain until
at least the sixth day, which for Dr. Ross would be billions of
years after plants and animals had first been created.) Incredibly,
Dr. Ross has also claimed that before the Flood &quot;probably
at least 19 out of 20 people were dying a death of murder. That's
what was keeping the people from living a long period of time.&quot;
(Note: To the contrary, the Bible indicates pre-Flood lifespans
were generally very long. The average for the patriarchs was 912
years. In addition, such violent conditions would cause people
to scatter all over the world--a problem for Dr. Ross, because
he teaches the Flood was local, not global.) [Hugh Ross, &quot;The
Flood&quot; audiotape (Reasons to Believe, 1990).]</P>

<P><B>10.</B> Noah's Flood (regional, not global). Dr. Ross teaches
that the Flood of Noah's day did not cover the entire planet nor
all Earth's mountains of the day. Rather, Noah and animals floated
on a shallow, temporary inland sea (22 feet deep), somehow covering
the Mesopotamian region; thus, it was a regional flood which destroyed
all mankind except Noah and his family). He believes that the
Flood did not destroy animals outside of man's sphere of influence;
death was basically limited to those &quot;livestock, poultry,
game animals,&quot; and any other birds and mammals that had contact
with man. [See: Facts &amp; Faith, Reasons to Believe's quarterly
newsletter, multiple part article on the Flood, 1989-91, especially
parts 7 and 8 (Fall and Winter 1990); Hugh Ross, &quot;Noah's
Floating Zoo,&quot; Facts &amp; Faith news letter Vol. 4 (Fall
1990), pp. 4-5; Creation and Time, p. 73; Hugh Ross, &quot;The
Flood,&quot; audiotape (Reasons to Believe, 1990).] <BR>
[NOTE: Dr. Ross claims that earth's entire human population was
limited to this Mesopotamian region. Yet, the Bible clearly states
that every land animal and bird on the face of the earth was wiped
out (Genesis 6:7; 7:21-23). Dr. Ross teaches that most of the
animals of the world were not affected, only those animals in
Mesopotamia. Of course, few, if any, of these animals were unique
to the region. According to Dr. Ross, all of today's land animals
and birds are not descended from the creatures on the Ark. In
other words, God required Noah to consume 120 years of his life
building a huge boat to save representative animals which really
didn't need to be saved. Most, if not all, of these animals were
alive and well in other parts of the world. In Dr. Ross's scenario,
dry land is just over the horizon all along. Despite the lack
of necessity, God keeps Noah trapped in this boat full of animals
under these strange circumstances for over a year.]</P>

<P><B>11.</B> &quot;Dual Revelation&quot; Theology. Dr. Ross frequently
says that Nature is &quot;the sixty-seventh book&quot; of the
Bible; he tends to treat Nature as equal in authority to the written
revelation of God (the Bible), and that neither is &quot;inferior
or superior&quot; to the other. Dr. Ross believes that Nature
provides an accurate understanding of God and His plan for history.
They are simply &quot;different, just like the content of Ezra
is distinct from that of Romans&quot; (Creation and Time, p. 57).
He proceeds to accept most of the interpretations of secular science
while attempting to maintain the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy.
He has accused young-earth creationists of believing in &quot;Single-Revelation
Theology&quot; and denying &quot;physical reality.&quot; He holds
the unorthodox theological view that, &quot;The plan of salvation
as stated in the Bible can be seen through observation of the
universe around us.&quot; For example, he teaches that Job &quot;without
the aid of scriptures discerned all the elements of 'the gospel,'
the good news of how man can find eternal life in God.&quot; [See:
The Fingerprint of God, second edition (1989), pp. 144-145, 163-164,
179-181; Creation and Time, pp. 11, 41, 55-57, 123; Hugh Ross,
&quot;Creation Days,&quot; audiotape (Reasons to Believe, 1990);
&quot;Hugh Ross's Apologetics Hot Line,&quot; Christianity Today
(March 11, 1991), p. 23.] <BR>
[NOTE: It is important to understand that: (1) Nature has no speech
or voice (Psalm 19:3). Therefore, Nature is subject to Man's misinterpretation,
as the history of science has repeatedly demonstrated; (2) Man
is particularly limited in his ability to know the ancient past
with certainty. We have no time machines to travel back and examine
actual events. Secular scientists, who describe in great detail
ancient animals and environments are guessing, making assumptions,
and hypothesizing; (3) The world and the universe have changed
since their creation.</P>

<P>The Fall and the global Flood of Noah greatly marred the perfection
of God's creations. What we have now is different in many ways
from what God originally created; (4) We humans are quite ungod-like
in our abilities and understanding. We are sinful, finite creatures
with an enormous inclination to believe in lies. Earth is under
the dominion of the Father of Lies, Satan. Our understanding of
this universe is very incomplete and fallible. Scientific opinions
are often biased and change regularly, sometimes radically. Dr.
Ross even goes so far as to make the strange claim that &quot;in
addition to the words of the Bible being 'God-breathed useful
for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness,'
so also are the words of God spoken through the work of His hands
&quot; (Creation and Time, p. 56). Dr. Ross elevates the message
of creation beyond its natural limitations. On many matters, it
is naive, pompous, and exceedingly dangerous to rate sinful man's
incomplete and changing understanding of this degenerating universe
as equal in clarity with the written Word of God! Such views have
led to dreadful errors. The Bible has demonstrated its beautiful
accuracy again and again, in contrast to the &quot;scientific&quot;
pronouncements of men which have frequently been wrong and often
dominated by blinding bias.]</P>

<P>PUBLISHERS' NOTE</P>

<P>September, 1993.</P>

<P>Dear Friend:<BR>
Greetings in the Lord. We are pleased to print Dr. Davidheiser's
booklet entitled &quot;A STATEMENT CONCERNING THE MINISTRY OF
DR. HUGH ROSS.&quot; This is an honest assessment of Dr. Hugh
Ross.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross is a fine Christian. However, his views on the Bible
and science need to be evaluated and exposed. Dr. Davidheiser
did just that.</P>

<P>We believe that this book will enlighten this generation concerning
the ministry of Dr. Hugh Ross. Dr. Davidheiser have studied most
of Dr. Hugh Ross's materials and tapes and found that Christians
need to know the exact position of Dr. Hugh Ross. Dr. Davidheiser
wrote: &quot;I have no desire to hurt him personally, and doing
so is the one thing that makes me somewhat reluctant, but it seems
definitely much more important to warn potential pastors who would
have him at their churches.&quot;</P>

<P>In fact, Dr. Davidheiser sent a copy of the draft of this booklet
to Dr. Hugh Ross for comments. Dr. Davidheiser said that &quot;I
think that the honorable thing to do is to send it first to Dr.
Ross to ask if he finds any errors of fact on my part. I sent
him a copy of the first edition and he had found no fault. He
seems to think people criticize him because they do not know what
a fine person he is and would not criticize him if they know him
personally....&quot;</P>

<P>Christians have to be informed about the exact position which
Dr. Ross takes. This is the only reason why you should read Dr.
Davidheiser's paper on &quot;A STATEMENT CONCERNING THE MINISTRY
OF DR. HUGH ROSS.&quot;</P>

<P>If you have any comments or reviews of the booklet, we would
be happy to hear from you. Please write to us.</P>

BOX 22<BR>
LA MIRADA CA 90637</P>

<P>When writing or speaking in defense of the Bible, several things
should be kept in mind. Honesty is imperative, and gives us the
advantage, for as John the disciple said, &quot;Thy word is truth&quot;
(John 17:17). False information or inaccurate statements may impress
the naive, but sooner or later someone will recognize them for
what they are. The main damage in this is that it will further
antagonize knowledgeable unbelievers and it becomes more difficult
to reach them. Presentations should be well researched to eliminate
error, but all of us are fallible, and when we make a mistake
we should be ready to admit it.</P>

<P>Dr. Hugh Ross has a worldwide ministry. His mission is to affirm
the scientific accuracy of the Bible. He has a large following
of enthusiastic believers who are impressed with his personal
testimony and his scientific information.</P>

<P>He is a &quot;Big Bang&quot; enthusiast. In fact, he is so
strongly attached to this theory that if it is ever replaced by
another, such as the plasma theory presently accepted by a minority
of scientists, it will be embarrassing to his ministry.</P>

<P>To those who do not know what the Big Bang is, it is the theory
that at some time in the past, now generally believed to have
been about fifteen to twenty billion years ago, all the matter
in the universe was concentrated into a single mass, which exploded
with a &quot;big bang.&quot;</P>

<P>The idea began with a Belgian astronomer, Georges Edward Lemaitre.
<B>According to Isaac Asimov, Lemaitre conceived this mass to
be &quot;no more than a few light-years in diameter.&quot; At
the very least, that would be two light-years or about twelve
trillion miles. By 1965 that figure was reduced to 275 million
miles, by 1972 to 71 million miles, by 1974 to 54 thousand miles,
by 1983 to &quot;a trillionth the diameter of a proton,&quot;
and now, to nothing at all!</B> A singularity! It exploded, producing
hydrogen and helium and perhaps some lithium. Time became the
hero and multiple billions of years, later it had produced everything
in the universe, including Lewis Carroll's famous &quot;shoes
and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings.&quot;</P>

<P>Two aspects of this theory have made it attractive to some
religious leaders and their followers. First, it resembles the
Bible in having matter come into existence at a certain definite
time instead of existing eternally in the past. Second, it proposes
matter coming into existence from nothing. However, the multiple
billions of years involved are not in accord with Biblical chronology
and the manner of development of galaxies, stars, planets, etc.,
is through natural forces instead of by divine fiat.</P>

<P>YOUNG EARTH VERSUS OLD EARTH <BR>
<BR>
Dr. Ross published a statement which sounds very good, &quot;We
affirm that Genesis [chapters] 1-11 is factual, as is the rest
of the book. We deny that the teachings of Genesis 1-11 are mythical
and that scientific hypotheses about earth history or the origin
of humanity may be invoked to overthrow what Scripture teaches
about creation.&quot; But there is an inconsistency between a
multiple billion year old earth and a Biblically recorded time
of only 1656 years from the creation of Adam, the first man, to
the flood. Anyone can figure out this interval of time in a few
minutes from Genesis 5 and 7:6. The record is presented as a straightforward
father-to- son genealogy with no gaps, but even if there were
gaps the calculation would remain valid because time is given
from the birth of one person to the birth of the next one mentioned.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross told me the solution is that some scholars interpret
Hebrew cardinal numbers differently than other scholars do. I
asked what Hebrew scholar I might consult for confirmation of
this. He named one, a Hebrew scholar whom he quotes in his book
The Fingerprint of God to uphold the idea that the days of creation
were longer than twenty-four hours. I wrote to him about the matter,
enclosing return postage, but received no reply. However, a difference
of opinion about the interpretation of these numbers should not
be so great as to make a significant difference between Biblical
chronology and the much greater scientific time.</P>

<P>As a Big Bang enthusiast, Dr. Ross needs lots of time for the
formation of the world and its contents. Naturally, he considers
the days of creation to be long ages. As is to be expected, and
as is common practice among those who espouse long ages of cosmic
and geologic time, he brings up the matter of the Hebrew word
yom, used for &quot;day&quot; in the creation account of the opening
chapter of Genesis. As in our language, this word can refer to
a day of twenty-four hours or it may represent a long period of
time, as &quot;In the day of Charles Darwin.&quot; The question
is: What does it mean in the account of creation? A common procedure
in such cases is to refer to authorities for an answer.</P>

<P>Dr. John R. Howitt, a personal friend of mine, now deceased,
wrote a pocket-sized booklet of nearly a hundred pages with 230
references to works of science, which he titled Evolution, &quot;Science
Falsely So-Called&quot; He wrote anonymously because he believed
he would lose his job if it became known that he was the author.
Dr. Howitt wrote to appropriate professors in nine leading universities,
asking, &quot;Do you consider that the Hebrew word yom (day),
as used in Genesis 1, accompanied by a numeral should properly
be translated as (a) a day as commonly understood, (b)) an age,
(c) either a day or an age without preference?&quot; Oxford and
Cambridge did not reply but the professors at Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Toronto, London, McGill, and Manitoba replied unanimously that
it should be translated as a day as commonly understood. Professor
Robert H. Pfeiffer of Harvard added, &quot;of twenty-four hours&quot;
to his reply. 4</P>

<P>Dr. Ross also supplies a list and his list of authorities interpret
the creation days as long periods of time. In his book he writes,
&quot;Many of the early church fathers and other biblical scholars
interpret the creation days of Genesis 1 as long periods of time.
The list includes the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century);
Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, apologist and martyr (2nd century);
Origen, who rebutted heathen attacks on Christian doctrine (3rd
century); Basil (4th century); Augustine (5th century); and, later,
Aquinas (13th century), to name a few. The significance of this
list lies not only in the prominence of these individuals as biblical
scholars, defenders of the faith, and pillars of the early church
(except Josephus), but also in that their scriptural views cannot
be said to have been shaped to accommodate secular opinion. Astronomical,
paleontological, and geological evidences for the antiquity of
the universe, of the earth, and of life did not come forth until
the nineteenth century.&quot;</P>

<P>However, Flavius Josephus, famous Jewish historian of the first
century, wrote about creation in the first chapter of Book One
of his Antiquities of the Jews, &quot;..God commanded that there
should be light: and when that was made, he considered the whole
mass, and separated the light and the darkness; and the name he
gave to one was Night, and the other he called Day; and he made
the beginning of light and the time of rest the Evening and the
Morning; and this was the first day....&quot; There seems to be
nothing comparable to the length of a geological age here or for
the other days of creation as he described them.</P>

<P>Josephus also said, &quot;On the fourth day he adorned the
heaven with the sun, moon, and other stars &quot; Rather clearly
he put the creation of the sun on the fourth day and did not have
it formed at the start of creation, as does Dr. Ross and also
Dr. Scofield in his famous Bible notes, to become visible on the
fourth day due to the removal of a cloud. Furthermore, Dr. Ross
says the seventh day, the day of rest, following the six days
of creation, &quot;is not closed out,&quot; and continues to the
present time.</P>

<P>Thus he says that all the time of recorded history, including
our own time, is included in the seventh day of rest. Contrary
to this, Josephus wrote about acts of God going on in time &quot;after
the seventh day was over.&quot; Furthermore, the Bible tells that
God did work aft* the seventh day of rest. Referring to miracles,
Jesus said, &quot;My Father worketh hitherto and I work&quot;
John 5:17). Also it is to be noted that there were special acts
of creation after the completion of the six days. During a famine,
a widow at Zarepath had left only a handful of meal in a barrel
and a little oil in a cruse. But because she befriended the prophet
Elijah, the meal and the oil were replenished as used and the
barrel and cruse did not become empty during the remainder of
the famine (I Kings 17:8-16). There were two occasions when the
Lord fed multitudes by multiplying a few loaves and fishes (Matthew
16:8-10, etc.). At a wedding in Cana He turned water into wine
instantly John 2:1-10). After referring to Josephus, Dr. Ross
cites examples of heroic &quot;early church fathers&quot; who
believed in long periods of time for the days of creation.</P>

<P><B>Origen held so many erroneous views that what he thought
of the length of the days of creation may be dismissed as of little
if any value. He spiritualized Biblical statements, seeking hidden
meanings instead of accepting literally what the Bible says, including
the resurrection of Christ from the tomb.</B></P>

<P>He contended that the literal sense is not that for which the
Holy Spirit gave the Scriptures to Christians and said, &quot;The
Scriptures are of little use to those who understand them as they
are written.&quot; He believed the task of commentators is to
penetrate alleged allegories of Scripture in order to find the
true meaning. This method opens the way for private erroneous
interpretations, as is characteristic of the cults.</P>

<P>Origen believed that rational beings were created as spirits
and as they became negligent in their adoration of God they fell
varying amounts into different categories, some becoming angels,
some human beings, and some demons. Jesus Christ, the Logos, was
the exception. He did not fall at all. But still this makes Him
subordinate to the Father, being at first on the same level as
created beings. For this Jerome, among others, considered Origen
to be the precursor to the Arian heresy, which in our day is expressed
in the theology of the Unitarians and the Jehovah's Witness cult.</P>

<P><B>Denying hell, Origen</B> reasoned that humans, demons, and
even Satan can, and in the end will, be reconciled to God, anticipating
the Universalist heresy. He said there is to be &quot;a purging
baptism of fire,&quot; and thus he anticipated the idea of purgatory,
which became a doctrine of the Catholic Church at the First Council
of Lyons in 838 A.D.. and affirmed at subsequent councils.</P>

<P>Then there was Augustine. Professor Paul Amos Moody of the
University of Vermont, in his college textbook, introduction to
Evolution, third edition, wrote, &quot;Wise churchmen like St.
Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas [another on the list of Dr. Ross]
early recognized that these chapters [Genesis 1 and 2], while
expressing important religious truths concerning the Creator,
should not be considered as literal history.&quot;</P>

<P>In another college textbook, Principles of Organic Evolution,
Arthur Ward Lindsey of Dennison University, wrote, &quot;...several
of the church fathers expressed ideas of organic evolution even
though the trend of ecclesiastical thought led more readily into
other lines of reasoning.&quot; He said that <B>Gregory of Nyssa,
Basil, Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas (all on Dr. Ross' list),
&quot;expressed belief in the symbolic nature of the Biblical
story of creation and in their comments made statements clearly
related to the concept of evolution.&quot; This being the case,
it is only natural that they would have to accept long periods
of time for evolution to proceed.</B></P>

<P>The famous evolutionist Henry Fairfield Osborn of Columbia
University and the American Museum of Natural History wrote that
Augustine &quot;sought a naturalistic interpretation of the Mosaic
record... and taught that in the institution of nature we should
not look for miracles but for the laws of nature.&quot;</P>

<P>Eldon J. Gardner of Utah State University wrote, &quot;St.
Augustine... favored an allegorical interpretation of the book
of Genesis in the Bible and openly promoted an evolutionary concept
as opposed to special creation.&quot; 9</P>

<P>W. R. Thompson, Ph.D., Catholic creationist, professor and
director of the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control at
Ottawa, Canada, is probably most well known for his challenging
fourteen-page introduction to a 1955 edition of Darwin's Origin
of Species. He wrote a paper (date not known) in which he said,
&quot;As early as 1921, Canon H. de Dolodot in La Darwinisme,
issued under the auspices of the University of Louvain, cites
St. Augustine as holding as certain the theory of absolute natural
evolution of living beings to the human body itself.&quot; He
is saying that Augustine accepted the evolution of living things
up to and including the bodies of human beings.</P>

<P>The point of all this is that liberals and evolutionists are
expected to advocate long periods of time for the origin of the
world and its contents. They have to. Large amounts of time are
necessary in evolutionary theory.</P>

<P>Irenaeus is left among the people listed by Dr. Ross as advocates
of long periods of time for origins. How his name got on the list
is not dear, for in the writings of Irenaeus I have not been able
to find anything indicating that he believed in long intervals
of time for creation. It seems he was an outright creationist.
Here are some quotations from his writings:</P>

<P>&quot;God is supreme ruler over all things, for they are His
own creation; with His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (the Holy
Spirit) He made all things.&quot; &quot;His own Word is both suitable
and sufficient for the formation of all things, even as John,
the disciple of the Lord, declares regarding Him: 'All things
were made by Him and without Him was nothing made' John 1:3).
Now among 'all things' our world must be embraced. It too, therefore,
was made by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis
that He made all things connected with our world by His Word.</P>

<P>David also expresses the same truth [when he said], 'For He
spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created'
(Psalms 33:9, 148:5).&quot; &quot;God is a Spirit, and so fashioned
everything by His Spirit.&quot; &quot;But man He fashioned in
His own hands.&quot; &quot;But God Himself brought a trance upon
Adam and put him to sleep.... And God took one of Adam's ribs,
and filled up the flesh for it, and built up the rib which He
took into a woman, and brought her in this wise to Adam.&quot;</P>

<P>THE ORDER OF EVENTS IN CREATION</P>

<P>The first chapter of Genesis records the chronological order
of events as they occurred during the creation week. Dr. Ross
lists thirteen creation events and says the probability that Moses
could have put all of them in the correct order, if he arranged
them by chance and not by inspiration, is only one chance in six
trillion (13 factorial = 6,227,020,800, or about six billion).
But he says Moses did arrange them in the correct order. Except
by faith, how is there any way of knowing whether Moses recorded
the events in the right order or not? The only other basis for
standardizing seems to be by comparing them with the order offered
by &quot;science,&quot; that is, using as a standard the order
give by evolutionary scientists in their textbooks. Actually,
this is putting the authority of the evolutionary scientists above
the authority of the Bible.</P>

<P>In the first place, the general reader of the Bible would conclude
that the original light upon the earth did not come from the sun
because the sun was not created until the fourth day. But the
science textbooks say the sun was formed before the earth, and
thus light upon the earth first came from the sun. Therefore the
general reader would conclude, based upon modern science, that
this was the first mistake of Moses in recording the order of
events in creation. To accommodate Genesis with science, Dr. Ross,
and before him Dr. Scofield in his famous Bible notes, teach that
the sun really was created at the start but did not appear until
a dense cloud was removed on the fourth day. But without this
explanation, the general reader, following the scientific view,
would believe that Moses had erred.</P>

<P>On the first day, when God said, &quot;Let there be light,&quot;
it was not necessary that the light be sunlight. In fact, if it
had been sunlight there would have been no occasion for God to
separate the light from the darkness, as the opacity of the earth
would have done it. In the New Jerusalem, in the future eternity,
there will be no need for the sun, for the glory of the Lord will
illuminate it (Revelation 21:23. See also Isaiah 60:19, 20). As
there will be no need for the sun then, there was no need for
the sun in the beginning, before the fourth day. Eventually the
sun will burn out if the Lord does not intervene, as the Bible
says He will.</P>

<P>Green plants were created on the third day. For the general
Bible reader, not influenced by Dr. Ross or Dr. Scofield, this
would be before the creation of the sun on the fourth day. If
the days were long periods of time, plants could not survive without
light for photosynthesis. As an explanation, Dr. Ross postulates
two clarifications of the atmosphere, a partial clarification
before the third day to make the cloud translucent so photosynthesis
could function and a complete clarification on the fourth day,
when the sun, moon, and stars became visible. The general Bible
reader would not know about these explanations and if accepting
long &quot;days&quot; in the creation account, would consider
this the second mistake made by Moses.</P>

<P>Created on day five were fish, birds, and whales, followed
on the next day by &quot;creeping things&quot; and mammals, including
man. The Hebrew word here translated &quot;whale&quot; is not
specific and can refer to an indefinite large sea creature. But
the general reader would understand the reference to mean whales.
As to the &quot;creeping things&quot; created on the sixth day,
the authoritative Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon to the Old
Testament says for Genesis 1:25, &quot;Remesm [asculine] a reptile,
collect[ively] reptiles.&quot; According to science, &quot;creeping
things,&quot; meaning reptiles, and even if thought also to include
insects, came before birds and whales and not after. This would
be considered Moses' third mistake.</P>

<P>EARTH'S EARLY ATMOSPHERE</P>

<P>On a tape Dr. Ross says, &quot;Science and the Bible totally
agree concerning the initial condition of planet earth, that the
earth began with an atmosphere dominated by ammonia and methane.&quot;
Where does the Bible say that?</P>

<P>He also says that the darkness which was &quot;upon the face
of the deep&quot; Genesis 1:27) was caused by the ammonia and
methane in the atmosphere. Actually, since the early 1980s the
Oparin-HaldaneUrey-Miller concept of an early atmosphere dominated
by ammonia and methane is being replaced by a theory that the
earth's early atmosphere was dominated by nitrogen and carbon
dioxide, formed by outgassing from the earth's interior through
volcanic action. Dr. Joel Levine, of NASA, found by computer analysis
that an ammonia-methane atmosphere at the earth's distance from
the sun would be chemically unstable and last only a very short
time. For a popular presentation of this, see Science Digest 91:5:42,
May, 1983. Oxidized iron in what are considered ancient rocks
leads some to think the early atmosphere had considerable oxygen.</P>

<P>The very latest on this may be seen in the August, 1993, issue
of Scientific American. It is reported that Dr. William Schopf
of the University of California at Los Angeles found supporting
evidence for the formation of the modern atmosphere about three
and a half billion years ago.</P>

<P>Scientists can change their minds but Dr. Ross said the Bible
agrees that the earth's early atmosphere was dominated by ammonia
and methane.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross further said the difficult problem was to remove the
ammonia and methane from the atmosphere and into space so light
could get through to the earth and still retain the water vapor
in the atmosphere. -lo accomplish this was a delicate operation,
he said, requiring considerable precision because the molecular
weights of methane, ammonia, and water are so close, being respectively
16, 17, and 18.</P>

<P>Concerning the possibility of gases being lost into space from
the atmosphere, he mentions-five factors. 1. The greater the mass
of a planet, the stronger the gravitational attraction, and thus
the greater the difficulty for gases to escape the atmosphere.
2. The smaller the size of a planet (for the same mass), the more
difficult the loss would be. 3. The temperature of each layer
of the atmosphere. 4. The temperature of the sun. 5. The kinds
and amounts of materials between the earth and the sun. Furthermore,
he says that all of these five factors would need to be held within
a variation of not more than one or two percent for billions of
years, and that the probability of this, putting it conservatively,
would be something like one chance in a billion.</P>

<P>What phenomenon, under these highly improbable conditions,
could have brought about the separation of ammonia and methane
from the atmosphere, with the retention of water vapor? He says
it was the separation of the moon from the earth in the early
days of their formation! &quot;When the moon was cast off [from
the earth] its mass was sufficient to bring about some changes.
The sun became gradually a little warmer because of the advancement
of its position along its evolutionary track. The changed parameters
caused the atoms [of the atmosphere] to lose enough temperature
and pressure to allow it [the atmosphere] to become transparent.&quot;
(As already mentioned, he says that for the sake of plants needing
sunlight to carry on photosynthesis, the atmosphere already had
become translucent previous to this.)</P>

<P>CONCERNING THE MOON</P>

<P>George Darwin, son of the famous Charles Darwin, was the first
to consider mathematically the relationship between the moon and
the tides. He believed that at one time the moon was a part of
the earth. Presently the moon is slowly receding from the earth,
and knowing the rate at which it is doing this, it might seem
to be an easy matter to calculate backward in time to find when
the moon was here as a part of the earth. But it is not that simple.
For example, knowing the rate at which people are leaving California
because of taxes and earthquakes, one can figure when no one will
be left in the state, but that won't happen.</P>

<P>Although the moon at present is slowly receding from the earth,
it does not necessarily follow that at one time it was here as
a part of the earth. Of current astronomical books consulted,
six favored the theory that the moon developed at the same time
as the earth from similar nebular material, six mentioned a separation-from-the-earth
theory and said it had to be abandoned, and one said Darwin's
theory &quot;cannot be excluded.&quot; The general opinion is
that at this time there is no satisfactory theory for the origin
of the moon. How then can Dr. Ross dogmatically say to his audience,
&quot;We know for certain that the moon came from the earth&quot;?</P>

<P>According to Darwin's theory, the earth was spinning at a terrific
rate and was still soft at the time the moon separated from it,
and so there was no problem as it passed through the Roche limit,
which would break up a solid body the size of the moon because
of the differences in gravitational attractions on the side toward
the earth and the side away from the earth. But Dr. Ross does
have this problem, because he assumes that the moon was split
from the earth as a solid and so would be shattered as it passed
through the Roche limit. He gives evidence, altogether unnecessary,
that gravitation was working at that time and so he concludes
the only way out of the dilemma, that the moon did not shatter,
is to believe its passage through the Roche limit must have been
a miracle!</P>

<P>Furthermore, if the moon had been expelled from the earth as
a solid entity and if somehow it had gotten through the Roche
limit intact, either it would have fallen back to earth again
or would have gone off into space. It would not have gone into
orbit around the earth. In order to get artificial satellites
to orbit the earth, the rockets that carry them must be directed
to change course after liftoff. If the moon somehow could have
come from the earth, in accordance with Darwin's theory and gone
into orbit, it would be expected to follow the earth's equator,
which it does not. However, it is reported that an attempt is
being made to revive the Darwinian explanation. 15</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says that the bed of the Pacific Ocean is the scar
left upon the earth that shows where the moon was removed. (The
volume of the moon is more than thirty times the present volume
of the Pacific Ocean.) However, he also explains it another way.
He says, &quot;The Bible tells us that God somehow allowed or
created an indentation in the earth...&quot; Where does the Bible
say that? He continues, &quot;and since water flows downhill,
all the ocean water flowed into that hole and dry land appeared
on the other side, and that's how come we have both oceans and
continents.&quot; He tells that this landmass broke into continents
and &quot;the continents are moving to fill in the Pacific Ocean
.... We know there is a hole in the Pacific Ocean and the continents
are moving to fill it in. The Atlantic Ocean is getting bigger
and the Pacific Ocean is getting smaller.&quot;</P>

<P>The most picturesque evidence of the separation of continents
by continental drift is the jigsaw pattern of the South America-Africa
complex. These continents appear as though they fitted together.
Geophysicists say South America is moving toward the Pacific Ocean
at the rate of about four-fifths of an inch per year because of
the rising and spreading of matter at the mid-Atlantic ridge and
not because of a Pacific Ocean sink that is drawing these continents
apart. The evolutionary authors of an article in Scientific American,
April, 1992, say the Atlantic Ocean is nearing its maximum width,
in contrast to the continued Westward Ho! of South America envisioned
by Dr. Ross. They consider it a repeat performance, with a single
supercontinent forming and breaking up every five hundred million
years or so.</P>

<P>In all the books I have seen which discuss continental drift,
India is pictured as an island near Antarctica, but instead of
drifting toward the Pacific Ocean, it went north and bumped into
Asia, raising up the Himalayan Mountains.</P>

<P>ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says astounding predictions can be made from the time
future planets still circulated as nebulous rings around a central
mass, which became the sun. He said, &quot;As a matter of fact,
this not only predicts the distance of each planet from the sun,
it predicts the size of that planet, also predicts the constitution
of each planet, what atmosphere it begins with, the initial condition
of that planet, how many moons that planet will have, how big
those moons will be, how far away they will be, and precise all
the way down the line....&quot; An astronomer assures me this
is equivalent to hogwash. Dr. Ross continues this sentence, &quot;not
only for our solar system but for the six solar systems we can
see besides our own.&quot; There is no other solar system that
we can see, much less six!</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says the prediction for the earth's moon was that
it would be about ten miles in diameter, and he says it was! But
during the catastrophic splitting off of our current moon from
the earth and its miraculous passing through the Roche limit,
our original ten-mile moon was destroyed.</P>

<P>Then he tells about a planet between Mars and Jupiter. (Remember
Bode's Law?) He says that as our moon was being pulled out of
the earth, leaving the bed of the Pacific Ocean as a witnessing
scar to confirm the event, the planet between Mars and Jupiter
got too dose to Jupiter- within its Roche limit and was broken
up, and that is the source of the asteroids. For emphasis he repeats
this several times, not as a theory but as a fact. Checking astronomical
books in libraries, I found the following: Seven authors hold
that the asteroids came about because the gravitational field
of Jupiter prevented hunks of matter in the original nebula from
coalescing into a planet. Three say it was unlikely that a planet
broke up. Two say that maybe a planet broke up, admitting the
possibility of what Dr. Ross says. One agrees with Dr. Ross and
one says the idea that the asteroids resulted from a broken up
planet must be abandoned. How, then, can Dr. Ross speak so dogmatically
as though he is stating a fact, when this idea is outvoted by
modern astronomers?</P>

<P>GRAVITY</P>

<P>He tells that the chance of the law of gravity not working
is one chance in 10 power of 200 Newton's law of gravitation,
no doubt, is the most inclusive generalization ever made: Every
object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe
with a force proportional to its mass and inversely to the square
of the distance between them. What would cause this not to work?</P>

<P>However, gravity may appear not to work when a magnet lifts
a paperclip from the top of a desk, but it is working. Gravity
might even appear not to be working when a ball is thrown upward,
but of course it is. Also gravity might appear not to work if
a predominance of the randomly moving molecules in an object happened
by chance to be moving upward in synchrony and the object levitates
for a brief moment. But gravity still would be working. Furthermore,
the probability of this happening would not be a definite number
but would depend upon the size and weight of the object. It would
not be the same for a grain of dust as for a freight locomotive.</P>

<P>THERMODYNAMICS</P>

<P>The second law of thermodynamics is one of the basic laws of
science. It states that in a dosed system, that is, without an
outside source of energy, randomness tends to increase. (Actually,
in nature there is no dosed system available for observation except
the universe as a whole.) A hurricane going through a lumberyard
and a hardware store can randomize things but it will never construct
a house.</P>

<P>When liquids of different temperatures are mixed, randomization
may not seem as obvious but the molecules will become randomized
and the mixture will be warmer than the cooler component and cooler
than the warmer one. Equilibrium will be established when the
temperature equals that of the environment. Here is what Dr. Ross
tells his audience about the second law of thermodynamics. &quot;Let
me tell you about the second law of thermodynamics. If it doesn't
work, then the water that you're drinking could cause your blood
to boil or freeze. The second law describes how heat flows and
we depend upon that heat flow with our lives. If I was concerned
about the second law of thermodynamics, I'd be very much afraid
of my blood boiling or freezing. But I'll tell you something.
I don't lose any sleep over it.&quot; (Laughter from the audience.)He
says that the probability of the second law not working is one
chance in 10 power of 80. He does not say how he arrived at this
but it would not be a fixed number. It would not be the same for
water at room temperature rising one degree above room temperature
as it would be for the same water causing blood to boil when ingested.
But both would violate the second law. In the taped talk Dr. Ross
tells the audience that the probability of thirteen Biblical prophecies,
selected out of thirty-five hundred, coming true strictly by chance,
is one chance in 10 power of 138. He does not explain on the tape
how he arrived at this number, but it is by attributing very large
odds against each one of these prophecies coming true, and the
total number of prophecies from which the sample was selected
is irrelevant. If the probability for each one of these thirteen
prophecies coming true is taken as one chance in a million, the
chance that all of them will happen is one chance in 1078. If
the probability for each happening is reduced to one chance in
a billion, the probability for all of them coming to pass is one
chance in 10&quot;7. This is still short of his 10 power of 138
figure by a factor of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. With his
figure of 10 power of 58 he concludes that this &quot;means that
the Bible, based on these thirteen predictions alone, is proved
to be 10 times more reliable than the second law of thermodynamics&quot;(10
power of 138/10 power of 80= 1058). Flaunting figures like this
impresses the naive, especially when the figures are used to uphold
the Bible.</P>

<P>DNA AND RNA</P>

<P>To an audience Dr. Ross said, &quot;Now by protein molecules
I mean those twisted double helices called DNA and RNA.... Without
these protein molecules, DNA and RNA, life would be impossible.&quot;
DNA and RNA are not proteins. They have a quite different chemical
composition and structure. In fact, some of the evolutionary scientists
who discuss the origin of life argue over the question which came
first, protein or nucleic acid. According to Sidney Fox, prominent
origin-of-life scientist, the protein-firsters have won because,
he says, amino acids contain their own instructions for their
own sequences,&quot; in forming proteinoids. &quot; It is through
particular proteins that the genes of heredity- portions of the
DNA molecules- are able to carry on their functions. DNA and proteins
depend upon each other. How could either have come first?</P>

<P>APPARENT AGE</P>

<P>This brings us to the matter of &quot;Apparent age at creation.&quot;
Dr. Ross considers this under the heading &quot;Gosse's 'appearance
of age' theory.&quot; 18 In a nineteenth century book, Philip
Gosse proposed such extreme views as: The earth's strata were
created with the fossils already embedded and the first trees
were created with deceptive rings of annual growth. Although Gosse
always seems to be brought into discussions of apparent age at
creation, no present spokesman for creation considers his views
as significant. But Dr. Ross says, &quot;Of late, however, Gosse's
'appearance of age' idea has seen a revival.&quot; 19 He refers
to the Institute for Creation Research and to the book The Early
Earth, by Dr. John C. Whitcomb Jr. 20 Dr. Whitcomb, of course,
repudiates Gosse and mentions that if &quot;appearance of age&quot;
be denied, New Testament miracles also must be denied. For example,
when Jesus turned water into wine at Cana, the people assumed
it had been produced from grapes that had grown slowly on vines,
which in turn had matured during growing seasons in a vineyard.
It had just been produced miraculously from water but it had the
appearance of age.</P>

<P>In his leaflet ##P8906, Glossary of Science and Theology Terms,
Dr. Ross has for the entry Appearance of Age, &quot;The hypothesis
that God created the universe, the earth, and life with (false)
indicators of a nonexistent past. If this hypothesis were true,
scientific measurements of great age conceivably could be reconciled
with a recent creation interpretation of certain Biblical passages.&quot;
Instead of accusing God of giving false indicators of a nonexistent
past, creationists question certain assumptions evolutionists
make in their measurements of time.</P>

<P>Actually, how could anything be created without appearance
of age? Even if trees had been created as seeds, the seeds would
have the appearance of age. If the first birds were created as
eggs, the eggs would have the appearance of age. It would seem
impossible for anything to be created without the appearance of
age. The appearance of age is irrelevant to concepts of the time
of creation.</P>

<P>In the same glossary he describes Ussher's chronology as a
hypothesized calendar of Biblical events based on the assumption
that no generations were omitted from the genealogies and that
the numbered days of the Genesis creation account were consecutive
24-hour periods.&quot; Suppose fifty or a hundred generations
were omitted from the Biblical chronologies (and it is not so),
there still would be no significant change in the difference between
Biblical chronology and the vast expanse of time required by the
Big Bang scientists.</P>

<P>THE TEACHING OF EVOLUTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says he knows evolution is still being taught in the
schools. This may be the understatement of the decade. He says
this is so &quot; in spite of the fact that biochemists, physical
scientists, and astrophysicists have long abandoned this theory
as totally unworkable.&quot; (Now it seems that creationists have
support from an unexpected source!) He shows the audience a high
school textbook which he says pushes Darwinian evolution, but
says he does not wish to criticize the book too strongly. He says
that Darwinian natural selection and evolution are not the same,
and indeed they are not. For nearly a century evolutionists have
been saying the same thing, but also they have been saying just
the opposite, whichever suits their purpose at the moment. A number
of times and for various reasons evolutionists have been saying
they might give up Darwinian natural selection as the mechanism
of evolution, but nothing better can be found than neo-Darwinism-
natural selection plus mutations and a few other things.</P>

<P>However, when the evolutionists spoke of giving up their faith
in Darwinian natural selection as the mechanism of evolution they
did not wish the public to think they were giving up their belief
in evolution itself, so they tried to make dear the difference
between natural selection as a theory and evolution as a fact.</P>

<P>According to Stephen J. Gould, natural selection triumphed
in the 1940s as the important mechanism of evolution. 21 But now
evolutionists are engaged in a highly emotional conflict, even
with name-calling, in reference to Darwinian natural selection
versus the &quot;neutral&quot; theory, in the finer details of
evolution at the molecular level.</P>

<P>To show that natural selection is not evolution, Dr. Ross (correctly)
uses the very same example that evolutionists use (incorrectly)
to tell the public that natural selection is evolution. This is
the highly touted case of the light and dark peppered moths (Biston
betularia) in England.</P>

<P>Before the industrial revolution the moths were all essentially
the light variety. As they rested on the trunks of trees in the
daytime, they blended with the background and predatory birds
had difficulty seeing them. The dark variety contrasted with the
background and thus these moths were easily seen and captured
by birds. Hence the population consisted almost entirely of light
moths.</P>

<P>However, with the industrial revolution, contaminants darkened
the trunks of trees and the situation with the moths reversed.
Now the light moths were more easily seen and captured by birds.
As would be expected, it did not take long until the population
of moths in the industrialized areas consisted almost entirely
of the dark variety. [This entire story has since been proven
fraudulent- see seminar tape #4]</P>

<P>This is an example of natural selection but it is not an example
of evolution (though the evolutionists use it as an example to
convince the public that it is evolution and that therefore they
must believe in evolution). The light and dark moths are merely
varieties of the same species and they are not evolving into anything
else. Actually, color varieties among butterflies and moths of
the same species is not uncommon. But a scientific journal hailed
this as &quot;The most striking evolutionary change ever witnessed
by man.&quot; 22</P>

<P>Evolutionists use the case of these moths and similar examples
to convince the public that evolution is a fact. Having done this,
they switch definitions and tell the public that since these moths
prove evolution to be a fact, they now must be consistent and
believe that phenomena that really would be evolution also are
factual. Here is their logic: Birds catch more dark moths from
a light background and more light moths from a dark background,
therefore fish evolved into amphibians, amphibians evolved into
reptiles, and reptiles evolved into birds and mammals, including
man.</P>

<P>By the way, when environmentalists cleaned up the contamination
and the tree trunks became light again, the population of dark
moths soon was replaced once more with light moths. Is this then
evolution in reverse?</P>

<P>In his discussion of the peppered moths, Dr. Ross tells his
audience they are butterflies, which they are not. He says they
originally were green, which they were not. (Apparently he thinks
they were protected by blending with green leaves.) Then he says
that as the green ones disappeared, both the light and dark ones
were protected. How could 60th contrasting types be protected?
By spending a short time in any public library he could have gotten
the facts straight.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says to an audience, &quot;The average eyesight in
this room is about three times more precise than it was in the
time of Christ.&quot; How could this be known? Concerning the
improvement in human eyesight, he says, &quot;That was simply
brought about by natural selection. It had nothing to do with
the changing of our genes or chromosomes.&quot; Natural selection
is based almost entirely on mutations of genes and chromosomes.
To what else could it be attributed? Hybridization and polyploidy
may have a minor role in natural selection but from an evolutionary
point of view they are dead ends. The difference between the light
and dark moths is due to a single mutation.</P>

<P>Explaining natural selection and eyesight he says, &quot;It's
simply a fact that those with poor eyesight had a greater chance
of being killed in battle... that's all.&quot; It may be pointed
out that anyone with such poor eyesight that he could not discern
a man on a horse coming at him with a spear or a combatant attacking
him with a sword, would be left at home and not be in the battle
in the first place. Thus natural selection would be expected to
preserve at least from death in battle, those in the population
with very poor eyesight.</P>

<P>Concerning the evolution of the horse, long the showcase example
of evolution through the evidence of the fossil record, he says
the inaccuracy of the textbooks is that the gaps in the diagrams
are attributed to missing links. He says instead that the gaps
represent extinctions instead of missing fossils in a continuous
series. As to the alleged extinctions he says that for years astronomers
have been trying to tell biologists that about once every twenty
million years or so a star explodes so close to the earth chat
it showers the earth with gamma rays, killing all advanced forms
of life. <BR>
(Modern evolutionists generally attribute large extinctions to
catastrophic hits upon the earth by asteroids or large meteorites.)</P>

<P>Dr. Ross explains that in this manner our planet is regularly
cleansed of advanced life. &quot;This is true of every advanced
form of life, whether it be the pig, the horse, the sheep, or
whatever,&quot; he says. According to him, what is considered
the earliest horse did not evolve into a higher form. Little Eohippus,
the &quot;dawn horse,&quot; now called Hyracotherium, &quot;dine
beast that looks like a hyrax,&quot; the coney of the Bible (Proverbs
30:26), was wiped out and replaced by the next form. Thus he seems
to be saying that Eohippus (Hyracotherium) was made extinct and
after its extinction was replaced by Orohippus, which after its
extinction was replaced by Mesohippus, which in turn was replaced
by Merychippus and then by Pliahippus and finally by Equus, the
modern horse.</P>

<P>This would be a lot of extinctions and replacements during
a long sixth day of creation. If each genus lived about twenty
million years, the time between explosions of nearby stars, and
at its extinction was immediately replaced by the next genus,
that would come to about one hundred twenty million years, beginning
well within the age of the dinosaurs and long before the expansion
of mammalian species from rodent-sized creatures.</P>

<P>MAN</P>

<P>As to man he says (Leaflet #8909), &quot;Starting about 2 to
4 million years ago, God began to create man-like mammals or 'hominids.'
These creatures stood on two feet, had large brains, and used
tools. Some even buried their dead and painted on cave walls.
However, they were very different from us. They had no spirit.
They did not have a conscience like we do. They did not worship
God or establish religious practices. In time, all these man-like
creatures went extinct. Then about 10 or 25 thousand years ago,
God replaced them with Adam and Eve.&quot;</P>

<P>As to the Neanderthals (spelling commonly modernized to Neandertals),
here are some excerpts from my book Evolution and Christian Faith
23 In 1956 a symposium was held in commemoration of the one hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of the Neanderthals. In preparation
for this symposium William J. Straus Jr., eminent anthropologist
of the Johns Hopkins University, and A.J.E.. Cave of the Department
of Anatomy at St. Bartholomew's College in London, were permitted
to examine the remains from which Marcellin Boule had made the
original description.</P>

<P>This was the basis for the subsequent descriptions of the Neanderthals
as inferior beings with bent knees and head thrust forward, widely
circulated in textbooks ever since. Straus and Cave, of course,
were familiar with the literature on the subject and they knew
that the specimen was pathological, but they said they &quot;were
somewhat unprepared for the fragmentary nature of the skeleton
itself and for the consequent extent of restoration required.&quot;
24 After a thorough investigation of the skeleton they concluded,
&quot;He cannot, in view of his manifest pathology, be used to
provide us with a reliable picture of a normal, healthy Neanderthalian.
Not withstanding, if he could be reincarnated and placed in a
New York subway- provided he were bathed, shaved and dressed in
modern clothing- it is doubtful whether he would attract any more
attention than some of its other denizens.&quot; 25</P>

<P>They conclude that &quot;there is no valid reason for the assumption
that the posture of Neanderthal man... differed significantly
from that of present day men... there is nothing in the total
morphological pattern to justify the common assumption that Neanderthal
man was other than a fully erect biped when standing and walking.&quot;
26</P>

<P>Two other anthropologists, C. Arambourg and E. Pattie, independently
published their views at about the same time as Straus and Cave.
They came to essentially the same conclusions, opposing the former
view that Neanderthal man walked with knees bent and head thrust
forward. 27</P>

<P>Another contributor to the symposium, Clark Howell, reported
that in bones other than the skull, differences between the Neanderthals
and modern populations are &quot;much less marked than some writers
in the past have been led to believe.&quot; He concluded that
the skeletons of Neanderthals are basically modern and former
views to the contrary are untenable. 28</P>

<P>Well-known anthropologist M.F. Ashley Montague wrote, &quot;Neanderthal
man walked as erect as any modern man, he did not have a bull
neck, and he was not knock-kneed. And it has long been proved
by many independent scientific investigations that the form of
the brow or of the head has nothing whatever to do with intelligence.
As a matter of fact, we have very good reasons to believe that
Neanderthal man was every bit as intelligent as we are today.&quot;
29</P>

<P>Bringing the matter up to date, in a highly acclaimed book
published in 1993, Erik Trinkaus, Professor of Anthropology at
the University of New Mexico and author of more than a hundred
articles on the Neanderthals, states, &quot;Anatomically, the
Neandertals are quite similar to ourselves, having a skeletal
arrangement identical to ours, brains as large as ours, and -
to the best of our knowledge, the capability to perform any act
normally within the ability of a modern human.&quot;</P>

<P>The Neanderthal brain capacity on the average was larger than
ours. They apparently buried their dead and left food and offerings
and flowers with the bodies. Formerly classified as Homo neanderthalensis,
the Neanderthals have been graduated to the same species as us,
Homo sapiens.</P>

<P>The cave-painting Cro-Magnons, referred to by Dr. Ross, were
very good Homo sapiens, that is, modern man.</P>

<P>Has Dr. Ross authority to say that the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons
did not have a conscience or that they did not establish religious
practices? Even savages today have their religions, though they
generally appease demons instead of worshiping the Creator until
instructed by missionaries. Apparently Dr. Ross means that God
replaced the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons with Adam and Eve as
He allegedly replaced Eohippus (Hyracotherium) with Orohippus.</P>

<P>THEISTIC EVOLUTION OR PROGRESSIVE CREATIONISM?</P>

<P>Theistic evolutionists accept evolution with its great lengths
of time but believe it came about through acts of God instead
of through natural processes.</P>

<P>Progressive creationists claim to be creationists. They believe
God created certain basic types of animals and plants which then
varied naturally as much as possible and when they could vary
no further, God created more and higher types. Two important questions
are: How much can living things vary in nature and how much time
is acceptable?</P>

<P>Progressive creationists accept the time of the evolutionists.
Belief in the extent of possible variation among plants and animals
varies with progressive creationists. It seems most commonly to
be accepted within the taxonomic category called the &quot;order.&quot;
For example, a weasel and a walrus belong to the same order. A
giraffe and a hippopotamus belong to the same order. This implies
that a weasel and a walrus could have been produced, in time,
from the same ancestry, and this would be defended as creation.
Similarly for a giraffe and a hippopotamus.</P>

<P>The American Scientific Affiliation was founded by a group
of Christian men of science to defend the Bible against the writings
of materialistic scientists, but it soon strayed. For example,
a regular columnist for its journal accepted the &quot;phylum&quot;
as the range within which natural variation can act. The phylum
is the most inclusive taxonomic category under &quot;kingdom.&quot;
The phylum Chordata includes all creatures that have bones, including
man, and some that do not. <BR>
According to that columnist, fish eventually could have produced
men and apparently he would not have called that evolution. But,
according to him, an ancestor of each of the invertebrate phyla
would have been created. He said there is a problem because one
would have to accept some creation! That is, one would have to
accept at least as many acts of creation as there are phyla instead
of accepting outright evolution!</P>

<P>In a public broadcast Dr. Ross appeared with an erudite evolutionist,
a physical anthropologist. The tape of this broadcast is in contrast
to taped sessions with naive and enthusiastic followers. Regarding
a popular definition of evolution as &quot;descent with modification,&quot;
he said, &quot;As long as the modification is understood in very
broad terms, I'd be comfortable with that.&quot; In other words,
if &quot;descent with modification&quot; (evolution) is understood
to be broad enough to include processes which are not strictly
natural but may include acts of God (theistic evolution) it is
OK.</P>

<P>In this tape he says, &quot;I would differ from, say, a theistic
evolutionist [then he abruptly changes the subject and does not
say how he would differ from a theistic evolutionist] and I don't
put all the miracles of God at the beginning of the Big Bang.
I see what takes place following the Big Bang as natural processes
[evolution], of course controlled by God [theistic evolution],
since He's responsible for the laws of physics. But that's what
science is all about, studying these processes.&quot; In spite
of his denial, this is an expression of theistic evolution.</P>

<P>Here the evolutionist interjects an approving, &quot;Right!&quot;</P>

<P>The dialog continues.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross. &quot;Just because the ICR [Institute for Creation
Research] says certain things about the Bible as literal doesn't
mean it [what the ICR says] has the approval of Hebrew scholars.&quot;</P>

<P>Evolutionist. &quot;Exactly, and similarly, I think that the
very strict young-earth creationism, which is to my mind scientifically
so unreasonable, has given conservative Christians a bad name.&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Ross. &quot;Yes, because I would take the position that
it is impossible to take the Bible literally and come to the conclusion
that the days are only twenty-four hours.&quot;</P>

<P>Evolutionist. &quot;Yes. &quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Ross. &quot;They must be long periods of time.&quot;</P>

<P>Evolutionist. &quot;Yes. &quot;</P>

<P>Thus Dr. Ross accommodates himself both to enthusiastic fundamentalists
and to gracious evolutionists.</P>

<P>BASIC CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE FROM NATURE?</P>

<P>Most important is the question, where does a theology which
includes the Big Bang theory and long ages for the days of creation
tend to lead doctrinally? Dr. Ross appears to be a theistic evolutionist
or progressive creationist and espouses a theology by which a
doctrine of salvation is obtainable from the observation of nature.
In support of this he says that Job, &quot;Without the aid of
scriptures and in opposition to the religion of his peers, discerned
all the elements of 'tine gospel,' the good news of how man can
find eternal life in God.&quot; 31 How could Job have done that?</P>

<P>Job and others who lived before the final atonement for sin
was made by our Lord at Calvary, who worshiped the true God and
observed His statutes, went to paradise, also referred to as &quot;Abraham's
bosom.&quot; An example is give in the case of a beggar named
Lazarus, who when he died was carried away by angels to Abraham's
bosom (Luke 16:19-31). No doubt Job was there also.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross cites the first chapter of Romans. The heathen are
without excuse for their idolatry because the evidences of creation
are so dearly revealed in nature. But freedom from idolatry through
recognizing that there must be a God of creation is a different
matter from understanding salvation by grace and receiving Christ
as personal Savior through accepting His atonement for sin. How
can anyone know this through nature?</P>

<P>He also cites Colossians 1:23, which speaks in the King James
Version about the gospel &quot;which was preached to every creature
which is under heaven.&quot; He says this means that &quot;According
to the Bible, everyone has the opportunity to know God,&quot;
and thus, since they do not have the Bible, the heathen must be
able to discern the way of salvation through nature. In the Greek
the preposition is &quot;in&quot; not &quot;to.&quot; A word for
word transliteration goes like this: &quot;...the glad tidings
which were proclaimed in all the creation which [is] under heaven.&quot;
&quot;In all creation&quot; is not precisely the same as &quot;to
every creature.&quot; Romans 2:14-16 may have a bearing on this.</P>

<P>We know there are heathen that have not heard the gospel of
salvation through the atonement made by the Lord Jesus Christ
upon the cross at Calvary and we know there are those in our own
country at the present time who have not heard, even among many
who go to church regularly. God is the righteous Judge. It is
not for us to judge but to minister the gospel wherever we can.</P>

<P>CREDENTIALS</P>

<P>In his publication Facts &amp; Faith, Spring, 1993, there is
a personal letter by Dr. Ross concerning those who criticize his
ministry, in which he says, &quot;Men with little or no formal
training in the sciences or theology dogmatically contradict the
science and theology of someone [himself] who has done postdoctoral
research (in astronomy) at Caltech and has served for many years
on the pastoral staff of a well-established evangelical church.
Why do my attackers never check with people who know me personally?&quot;</P>

<P>As to the implication that opposition is only from the unqualified,
he must be aware of critical articles by qualified scientists
at the Institute for Creation Research at El Cajon, California,
32 as well as others. As for myself, I have a Ph.D. in Zoology,
taught at the college level for more than twenty years, have written
extensively on the creation evolution issue including a book that
went through thirteen printings, spoken in churches, schools,
and conferences coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada, and been
repeatedly on the radio and TV. But errors may be pointed out
by anyone knowledgeable enough to defect them, whether professional
scientist or housewife.</P>

<P>He told me his blunders are a thing of the past so I tried
to obtain recent tapes, hoping to be able to substantiate this.
But he informed me he discussed this with his staff and it was
decided I should be denied access to the tapes of his latest graduate
course for Simon Greenleaf University.</P>

<P>Their opinion was that my &quot;reason for wanting the tapes
is not to learn more about the latest discoveries proving the
existence of the God of the Bible and the accuracy of the words
of the Bible, but rather to discover new errors and mistakes [he]
might have made while speaking.&quot; They added that &quot;they
are ready and willing to change their decision given some evidence
of change of attitude on [my] part.&quot;</P>

<P>If it were merely a matter of many scientific blunders, there
would be little value in writing an article to point them out.
But when associated with the Bible and a theology of salvation
through observing nature, as well as promoting theistic evolution
or progressive creationism, these things need to be told.</P>

<P>An especially competent scientist who is a creationist tells
me this article is too long. He says the naive followers of Dr.
Ross will forgive him readily for his scientific mistakes and
there is no need to mention so many of them, for &quot;his errors
are innumerable, and you could spend the rest of your life recounting
them.&quot;</P>

<P>Another Christian critic makes the following evaluation. &quot;Part
of his benevolent image is that he remains cool under fire, a
gentleman to the death, so to speak, one who is always kind to
his sharpest critics as to his closest friends. He's magnificent
at this. I've seen him and been totally impressed by his gracious
good manners and kind concern for those who oppose him. In other
words, he understands the psychology of argument, and that's why
he scores big on the logic of argument. He appears to be logical,
and to many people this appearance passes for logic itself.&quot;</P>

<P>In my experience with him by correspondence, on the phone,
and meeting him personally, I have always found him courteous
and calm and never excited or angry about anything.</P>

<P>Evolutionary theory is in conflict with basic Christian doctrine.
If evolution is true, we are improved animals instead of fallen
sinners in need of redemption. If evolution is true, we have no
need of the Savior, there is no occasion for the Redeemer.</P>

<P>Dear Kent:</P>

<P>I have a whole page of notes and deep thoughts on creation.
Hope you can call sometime.</P>

<P>I don't mean to belabor Hugh Ross. But I had not realized how
extensive his plague has become within Christendom until I heard
a tape by Ken Ham. Young earth creationists are now mocked more
than ever because they point out that most Christians and theologians
believe in evolution. And they are tragically correct. In supporting
the Gap and Progressive Evolution, Christians have slept with
the enemy and then wonder why there is a plague of violence in
Public Schools where this religion is taught with the blessing
and support of most Christians. In so doing they have sown the
wind, but will reap the whirlwind.</P>

<P>Something more struck me about Hugh Ross Theology. He keeps
harping the on Antarctica Penguins surviving the local flood.
Well it occurred to me that if animals made it that far from Mesopotamia
PRIOR to the flood, then much of the remaining animal kingdom
would also have migrated across the entire face of the earth.
And guess what? If animals had already filled the earth, then
humans whom God had made to have dominion over these very animals
would just as likely have also spread throughout the earth. This
would be population projection of up to billions of people who
are Post Adamic and Noah's contemporaries who did not sin, do
not need a Savior, did not need to be destroyed, and would not
destroyed according to the implications of Hugh Ross's theology
of a local flood, or at least according to what would have to
be the consequences of this theology. So where is the evidence
of all these skeletons not buried in a non-existent global flood?
It is very frightening to contemplate a local flood. Because this
also means ONLY a local judgment.</P>

<P>Imagine that a small percentage of the earth about the size
of Iraq is destroyed by Noah's Flood, while the rest of the earth
and population (99+%) is not wicked at all or wicked enough to
be judged, and hence does not need a savior. This would also mean
that only a small percentage of today's population is descendants
of Noah's family, the rest are descendants of the rest of the
unflooded population of the earth...that is descendant's of a
population that was not wicked at all or superior to those who
were destroyed in a local flood. If Hugh Ross believes all human
population was destroyed by local flood and the local animals
except those people and animals on the Ark who were preserved,
then he is saying that animals spread throughout the globe, but
humans stayed put in a small fertile plain too dumb to run from
a local flood. But wouldn't at least one human being (prior to
the Flood) who is a descendant of a human population which was
not primitive but rather intelligent enough to have speech, talk
to God, build cities, who was curious enough to follow at least
one of these animals who migrated to Antarctica and the rest of
the globe, thereby spreading the population out at least as far
as modern day Egypt, Turkey, or India? Wouldn't the descendants
of Adam in the few thousand years up to Noah have migrated as
far as they migrated after Noah? And wouldn't at least one human
being be smart enough to even escape a local flood, e.g., those
populations living near its boundaries. Recent discoveries in
the Western Hemisphere of a number of ancient people such as the
Kennewick man who has been dated to be several thousand years
old, demonstrate how rapidly post Flood people migrated even to
the ends of the earth. So Hugh Ross would have to confine the
human population to any area the size of Iraq at the time of the
Flood if he believes all humans were destroyed, while still maintaining
a local vs. global deluge. But if his animal hypothesis of pre-Flood
migration is to hold up, then human migration outside the region
of a local flood would have to be maintained. But this is a logical
and Biblical impossibility because Genesis records that ALL of
the population of the earth, that is every nation, came from those
who were scattered from the Tower of Babel. But Hugh Ross's Theology
would suggest that all of those nations are along side the 70
initial Nations from Babel.</P>

<P>WHERE ARE THEY? They would have to speak the same language
and tongue because they were not part of the Babel scattering.
Some argue that it was the scattering the caused the different
languages. But that is NOT what the Bible says. God confounded
their speech and then and only then were there many languages
and tongues. Hugh Ross would have to accommodate all of these
nations and population outside of Mesopotamia. So we would have
Hugh Ross nations and Noah's descendants nations living along
side each other or co-mingling. Sound good? Only problem is that
Genesis states that it is from Babel that ALL of the nations that
spread throughout the earth. So we are left with believing Hugh
Ross or the Bible. As for me and my household, we will serve the
Lord and believe his word only.</P>

<P>Christ's own words &quot;as in the days of Noah so shall be
the coming of man&quot; would have to mean only local wickedness.
We would have to question or deny the rest of Christ's description
of the birth pangs on the earth being only local. The Apostle
Peter's references to the Flood and Fire could only be local.
All of the plagues in Revelation could only be local...e.g. &quot;a
third of the trees burned up&quot; only in some local region (not
the entire earth)...&quot;a third of the rivers turned to blood&quot;
must only mean the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates (where the
3 evil spirits come out in the end times). You can begin to see
how this theology becomes preposterous. Another point about his
local flood. Genesis points out that there are FIVE rivers which
include the Tigris and Euphrates. It is amazing how powerful a
local flood was to change the geology and topography of the earth
so dramatically to leave only these two rivers, when every observed
flood in the history of the earth leaves the same rivers once
the flood stages recede (example: the great Mississippi Flood
a few years ago). The WHOLE earth travaileth and groans for Christ's
return because the WHOLE earth is corrupt and has been defiled.
If only a local flood and judgment was necessary, there would
be no sense in describing the whole earth in need of a savior
and a need for his return to repossess what he alone has ransomed.</P>

<P>Hope this is illuminating in some way!</P>

<P>Blessings!<BR>
James Sundquist</P>

<P>Dear Kent,<BR>
Just heard your Oct 1 and Oct 8 Hugh Ross Debate.</P>

<P>Here are my comments:</P>

<P>1. Once again Hugh Ross maintains that the physics has not
changed from Creation. Yet in the first debate he maintains that
the moon receding from the earth was NOT linear, meaning not constant.
So, once again he contradicts his own theory of uniformitarianism.
Physics remaining the same rules out ALL miracles too.</P>

<P>2. He says the sun existing from the beginning and only became
visible on the 4th Day of Creation. Visible to whom? Certainly
not God as the Scriptures said he saw. Certainly not animals,
they are created on the 5th Day. Certainly not Humans as they
were not created until the 6th Day. Unless he is talking about
plants that he says live (even though they did not have the breath
of life: Nephesh). I guess his plants can both live and see. The
next thing he will have them do is talk? Finally, if the sun were
already there in day one it would be visible and would appear
because the firmament (sky and clouds) were NOT there yet until
the 2nd Day of Creation.</P>

<P>3. Regarding the Sabbath and his insistence that it was a day
of indeterminate length. Christ himself demolishes this argument
when he said that the Sabbath was made for man. If a day is even
a thousand years (to man), no man has ever yet lived past 969
years. So no man has ever celebrated or existed for one sabbath
day, let alone sabbath year. Even if man did celebrate and rest
on the sabbath day, the sabbath day had to end at some point in
order for the cycle to begin again to rest on the next sabbath
day 7 days later. He maintains that Lev. 25 is referring to sabbath
years as an analogy NOT an exact science. This is one of his most
amazing blunders of all. Maybe Hugh Ross did not take these years
literally, but you can be certain that God did not mean them as
a parable. Hugh Ross is in good company. Hugh Ross is not alone
in thinking they were not to be taken seriously or scientifically.
The false prophets in Israel and the whole nation of Israel also
did not believe or take these sabbatical years seriously. In fact,
so exact were these 6 years of working the land and keeping the
ground fallow on the 7th year that God told Moses that he would
not only require Sabbath Year compliance, but multiply the years
by seven and collect them from the land anyway and vomited out
the Israelites and took them into captivity. And Daniel the prophet
(who, unlike Hugh Ross, took those curses literally and scientifically,
believed Moses and believed Jeremiah who also took these years
literally and scientifically. Daniel even asks the Lord in prayer
if these years were coming to and end? And of course, the angel
of the Lord confirmed that they were (that is the literal scientific
Sabbath years of the ground remaining fallow.)</P>

<P>4. If you are going to use &quot;one day to the Lord is as
a thousand years&quot; Scriptures in Peter and the Psalms, then
go ahead and make each day of Creation one thousand years. (You
can't make a day a million years and be consistent with those
Scriptures.) But even if you do this, you still have an earth
that is only 13,000 years old (7,000 + 5,000)....insignificant
time if the big bang theory is true. And as you well point out
if each day is a thousand years, it causes a host of other problems
beside a light source, such as plants waiting a thousand years
to get pollinated.</P>

<P>5. As in #1 above where he states that physics are constant,
the plate tectonics are constant. This collides with the Psalm
the confirms the mountains were raised and the valleys pushed
down in a rapid catastrophe of Noah's Flood in which case the
physics and plate tectonics rate of movement were not constant.
And once again it collides with his own statement in first debate
that moon receding from the earth is NOT constant. But his constant
rate plate tectonics would not even allow for a global Luciferian
Flood catastrophe which would require changing decay rates.</P>

<P>6. Ross states that we can't observe the present, only the
past. Doesn't this collide with Romans 8:18-20 where God says
man is without excuse because he made them to understand from
what he made? That is what we PRESENTLY see? Also, this passage
states that man did understand and comprehend from the beginning
of Creation. This demolishes his hominid Creation Gap pre-Adamic
Race. Adam &amp; Eve were the beginning (Christ's quote of the
first marriage). Ross also states in his books and articles that
hominids which he insists were the first manlike creatures before
Adam did not comprehend God in order to worship him. This further
contradicts the Apostle Paul's passage here in Romans that clearly
states men DID comprehend from the beginning of CREATION. <BR>
James Sundquist</P>

<P>Dear Kent,<BR>
As you prepare for your next debate on Days of Creation with Hugh
Ross, the Lord struck me with a Scripture that I knew but never
saw in the following light as to pertain to Creation Days in Genesis.</P>

<P>Zechariah 14:5-8</P>

<P>5 You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to
Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake [1] in the
days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come,
and all the holy ones with him. 6 On that day there will be no
light, no cold or frost.</P>

<P>7 It will be a unique day, without daytime or nighttime--a
day known to the LORD. When evening comes, there will be light.
8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half
to the eastern sea [2] and half to the western sea, [3] in summer
and in winter.</P>

<P>I had always thought of this Scripture in light of prophecy
and the end of the Ages, to which it certainly is speaking. But
just this last week I was so struck by God's description of this
DAY as both a literal day but even more critically, he calls it
a UNIQUE day. His description of this yet future UNIQUE day is
certainly UNIQUE in its splendor and glory. But what the Lord
showed me, and perhaps had already showed you years ago, was that
if this is the only day since the beginning of Creation which
HAS NO DAYTIME OR NIGHTTIME, MEANING 24 HOUR CYCLE OF NIGHT OR
DARKNESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE EARTH WITH LIGHT (WHICH HE DIVIDED
FROM DARKNESS) ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH. THEN GUESS WHAT?!?!?
EVERY SINGLE OTHER DAY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF CREATION AND THROUGHOUT
THE FUTURE MUST HAVE 24 HOUR DAYTIME AND NIGHTTIME CYCLES. IF
THERE WERE NOT TRUE, THEN, THE DAY IN THIS SCRIPTURE WOULD NOT
BE UNIQUE. Of course, there are other Scriptures to corroborate
this. But it would be the only one you would need to demolish
the stronghold of day/age theory. Christ himself refers to Zechariah
and thus authenticates that he is a true Prophet from God. To
further confirm that this was a literal day, Zechariah compares
it to the literal days of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah
king of Judah. In this future unique day there will be another
earthquake. The only other day which could challenge the uniqueness
of this day would be Joshua's long day. But the important distinction
here is that IT WAS STILL DARK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET
FOR THE TWELVE HOURS. Zechariah's day was GLOBAL light. Further
Scriptural corroboration is found in which describes Christ's coming
as the lightning shines from the east to the west, meaning the
whole earth is engulfed in white light, where Christ destroys
the AntiChrist at the brightness of his coming (2Thes 2:8). <BR>
Also, Zechariah's unique day retains its uniqueness because it
is the ENTIRE 24 HOUR DAY (not just a day which has an extra 12
hours). Of further interest in Zechariah's passage is that evening
still comes, meaning the earth's rotation does not stop, and even
this unique day is 24 hours long. <BR>
It is just that at nighttime when the sun goes down, it is still
light (just not light from the sun).</P>

<P>This seems like a perfect Scripture for the Day/age segment
of your debate. So much for Hugh Ross statement in the last debate
that the Prophets support his day/age theory. Isn't it a lock???</P>

<P>What do you think of this illumination?<BR>
James Sundquist</P>

<P>Here is more proof that Hugh Ross is telling more lies. Here
is the web site which shows the views of the signatories of the
Westminster Confession confirming that they believe in Creation
Days as 24 Hours. If it is not enough to trash the Prophets he
now has questioned the writers of the Westminster confession.

<P>Hope this helps!</P>

<P>I am very surprised that John Ankerberg did not nail him in
his tracks on this one!</P>

<P>Thanks!<BR>

<P>Dear Kent,<BR>
Here is the letter I tracked down which Dr. David Menton (young
earth physician) sent to John Ankerberg regarding his concerns.
I wish I could have found this to send to you BEFORE your debate.
But now perhaps you have another colleague (we must bind together
in this war). <BR>

<P>Mr. John Ankerberg<BR>
The John Ankerberg Show<BR>
P.O. Box 8977<BR>
Chattanooga, TN 37411</P>

<P>Dear John:</P>

<P>Following the events of the last several months, and particularly
our phone conversation on May 27, I am deeply concerned that your
TV series and book will not be as compatible with Biblical creation
as at least I had envisioned when I first agreed to participate.
My first concern occurred at the time of our video taping session
at the Rhea County Court House when you expressed reluctance to
having the members of our panel get involved with evidence for
a young earth lest we lose the audience we were trying to reach.
This surprised me since virtually all of the scientists you invited
to participate on that day were young earth creationists.</P>

<P>Two of the members of the panel, Austin and DeYoung, discussed
scientific evidence for a young earth in their presentations and
I was disappointed that their views on this matter would be edited
out of the tapes and book.</P>

<P>My next concern came when our conference phone calls and group
mailings did not include Duane Gish. I began to suspect that,
for some unexplained reason, Duane was out of the book and wondered
if he might be edited out of the TV series as well.</P>

<P>Duane's views on creation and evolution are well known from
his many debate tapes, videos and publications. I could see no
reason why anyone who would invite him to participate in the first
place, would have occasion to be either surprised or disappointed
with his presentation.</P>

<P>Then the manuscripts for the book began to come in and with
them more cause for concern. After seeing DeYoung's manuscript
censored of any discussion of the age of the earth, I began to
wonder how Steve Austin's original field research on Mt. St. Helens
and the Grand Canyon could be purged of all evidence for catastrophism
and a young earth. This really bothered me because Steve was perhaps
the only person involved in your TV series and book who presented
his own relevant laboratory and field research. In a phone conversation
with Kurt Wise in December, I was told that Steve's paper was
being completely rewritten.</P>

<P>When my last group of manuscripts arrived I noted that Steve
Austin's manuscript was still not in and that now even his name
was missing from the mailing list of those receiving manuscripts!
Clearly something was going on behind the scene about which I
was being kept in the dark. Finally, the whole mess was revealed
to me in our last phone conversation. My worst suspicions were
confirmed; of all the people who were asked to give up a weekend
with their families and spend 12 straight hours taping your TV
series on Creation, only Kurt Wise and I remained! If I understand
you correctly, Duane Gish was eliminated for not being &quot;up
to date,&quot; Steve Austin was eliminated because he might turn
off folks with his ideas on the age of the earth, and Don DeYoung
was eliminated because &quot;no one liked his manuscript!&quot;
Well, I for one, was quite pleased with the contributions of all
three of these men at our taping session. I liked DeYoung's manuscript
though I agree that it would have benefited from some revision
(particularly the section on the planets).</P>

<P>Of the manuscripts still being considered for publication,
I was especially pleased with those of John Oller, J. P. Moreland
and Thaxton &amp; Bradley. Oller covers some new ground in the
creation- evolution controversy in providing compelling evidence
that the whole human capacity for language could not have evolved
in progressive steps over time but demands the intelligent design
of a Creator (by the way, Oller too is one of those young earthers
and ICR supporters!). Moreland and Thaxton &amp; Bradley provide
lucid digests of the main features of their important published
books.</P>

<P>I must confess that at the time I read his manuscript, I was
unfamiliar with Hugh Ross. I found his discussion of evidence
for design in the universe to be interesting though a bit pedantic
and convoluted in style. In my opinion, it is a pity that Ross
is going to replace DeYoung in your book because I believe more
people would have benefited from reading DeYoung's discussion
of the unique biological suitability of the earth. Compare, for
example, Ross' treatment of the effects that multiple moons might
have on the earth with DeYoung's treatment of the same subject.
For Ross, it's just another item in one of his several lists of
&quot;facts&quot; while DeYoung discusses the implications of
this surprisingly important point in a lucid and interesting way
that would appeal to the average reader.</P>

<P>I have some far more serious reservations about some of the
claims and implications in Ross' manuscript. I was deeply troubled
by Ross' premise, in the very first paragraph of his paper, in
which he insists that one's theology should be made to fit one's
cosmology, and not the other way around! This is particularly
disturbing given the necessarily speculative nature of the whole
field of cosmology. Why should a Christian, of all people, insist
that where the speculations of fallible men are in contradiction
to the infallible Word of God, it is God's Word that will have
to somehow give way. But then Ross doesn't appear to speculate
in his manuscript, he simply declares that the universe is 17
billion years old, and then pompously demands that &quot;all age
stretching attempts to save non-theistic science should cease!&quot;
Most cosmologists are currently satisfied with their 17 billion
years for the age of the universe, but if the plasma model for
the origin of the universe replaces the Big Bang in popularity,
and they demand hundreds of trillions of years, I don't doubt
that Hugh Ross will find a way to grant it to them from his marvelously
elastic Bible. After all, according to Ross, theology must be
made to fit cosmology.</P>

<P>After reading his manuscript I was quite anxious to learn a
little more about Hugh Ross and his views on creation. A friend
in St. Louis called my attention to the ICR Impact articles 217
&amp; 218 about Ross and loaned me a copy of Ross' book, The Fingerprint
of God. I was shocked to see Ross dismiss Henry Morris, and apparently
all creationists like myself who &quot;hold to a 24-hour creation
day,&quot; as folks who present &quot;bogus evidences for a young
universe&quot; and who only succeed in &quot;misguiding many whose
science education and biblical training are inadequate to aid
them in evaluation&quot; (The Fingerprint of God, page 155). Wow!
Are you sure he is one of the good guys John? I mean with people
like this on our side we really don't need any opposition.</P>

<P>As I had feared, Ross' publicly expressed disagreements with
creationists such as Henry Morris, go well beyond merely the age
of the earth and universe. As is so often the case with progressive
creationists he is left with a lot of time that needs to be somehow
forced into the precisely defined days of Scripture and this leads
to all sorts of mischief. Since one of the reasons progressive
creationists accept a 4.5 billion year old earth is their uncritical
acceptance of an essentially evolutionary interpretation of the
geological column, they must inevitably deny the global nature
of the Noachian Deluge so clearly taught in the Bible. This inevitably
requires that the geological column show evidence of God's &quot;progressive
creation&quot; rather than evidence of God's angry judgment of
death and destruction in a world-wide flood. Then, since fossils
in the geological column obviously include the dead remains of
animals and men, the progressive creationist inevitably must argue
that physical death did not come into the world by sin, as the
Bible clearly teaches, but rather God intended from the beginning
for animals and men to suffer pain and death. This finally denies
the very Gospel of Jesus Christ who was sent into the world to
save man from sin, death and the power of Satan.</P>

<P>One has only to examine Ross' own view of the Gospel to see
the fruit of the dreadful cascade that begins with denying a literal
six day creation. In his book The Fingerprint of God (pp. 180-
161), Ross declares that all that is necessary for man to be saved
may be learned from nature itself, apart from the Bible.</P>

<P>Obviously, no one can learn from nature about the undeserved
love of God in sending his only begotten Son Jesus Christ to save
man from sin and death through His perfect life, death and resurrection.
The Bible declares that this Gospel is an unfathomable mystery
to unregenerate man and must be revealed in the Word of God (the
Bible) through the power of the Holy Spirit. In contrast, Ross'
&quot;gospel&quot; is reduced to the religion of universalism
where any one can be &quot;saved&quot; by merely recognizing God
in nature. How truly the Bible says: &quot;a little leaven leavens
the whole lump.&quot;</P>

<P>John, I fear that you may yet join James Dobson in his unqualified
endorsement of Hugh Ross and progressive creationism. At least
it was clear from our phone conversation that you intend to permit
Ross to promulgate his views in your TV program and book despite
what I gather has been a great outpouring of concern and reservations
on the part of many Christians. I understand that it is your show
and you are free to include or exclude any ideas or people you
wish. Still, I fail to see why you have chosen to complicate things
for your TV series and book (to say nothing of your viewers and
readers) by bringing in a man who has publicly shown contempt
for the intelligence, views and motives of many of the very sort
of Christians you chose for your panel. If you prefer the views
of Hugh Ross over men like DeYoung,</P>

<P>I fail to see why you initially sought the support of the ICR
folks who for years have warned Christians about the grave Spiritual
dangers of progressive creation and theistic evolution. Surely
you could have assembled a large panel of scientists with strong
academic credentials from the roster of the American Scientific
Affiliation who would have been much more comfortable with such
views.</P>

<P>John, while I am professionally concerned that people discover
and understand science as accurately as possible, I am personally
even more concerned that they find a saving faith in the redemptive
work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This can only come
to those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit, humble themselves
before the Word and let God's Word be true though every man be
made a liar. I don't believe that it is evolutionism that stands
in the way of man's acceptance of the Gospel of Christ but rather
man's unbelief in the Word of God itself. Surely we will not lead
any one to Christ by attempting to rationally convince them of
some form of creation at the expense of the clarity and inerrancy
of God's Word. After all, Satan himself believes in creation.
Perhaps a more limited objective of merely attempting to rationally
convince people of intelligent design in nature may be a worthwhile
goal on a Christian TV program such as yours, but we must not
undermine the Word of God in the process.</P>

<P>I have tried to communicate to you how strongly I feel about
your decision to eliminate the ICR scientists from your TV show
and book, and to put in their place a man like Hugh Ross. We each
have to do what we think is right before God no matter how much
it may offend some men. I have decided that I can no longer be
a part of the direction you are taking your TV series and book.
I must ask you to let me join my friends from ICR and edit me
also out of your TV series and book. If you choose, you are free
to have someone write up any information or ideas I have shared
with you but my name and participation must not be mentioned.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Sincerely,<BR>
David N. Menton</P>

<P>November 16, 2000<BR>
Dear Kent,</P>

<P>I want to extend to you and your family my profound gratitude
for your invitation to be a guest commentator on your Hugh Ross
debate as well as the privilege to do battle in the heavenlies
with you. Jo's cooking and Marlissa and your staff's hospitality
made me feel like royalty.</P>

<P>You asked me to send my final closing conclusion and comments
to you for your final videotaping. You are certainly welcome to
quote me below, either verbally, or as text on the screen in your
final arguments that you videotape.</P>

<P>So here they are:</P>

<P>1. In the coming Millennium, God is going to RESTORE all things
as it was prior to the Fall of Adam. Acts 3:21.</P>

<P>&quot;If God is going to restore the earth in the age to come
to Hugh Ross' version of his pre-Fall friendly and good world
of death, destruction, disease, pain, sorrow, grief, mutations,
predation, survival of the fittest, with NO Paradise, in which
man had no dominion over animals, then I would prefer to live
in the present age&quot;. James Sundquist</P>

<P>But in fact, God's description of the Millennium and the New
Heaven and New Earth which is the restoration of all things (before
the Fall of Adam) does not describe Hugh Ross' pre-Adamic world
without sin.</P>

<P>2. Hugh Ross has changed the Sabbath Day from a blessing to
man into a curse. Hugh Ross has given absolutely no mechanism
or revelation for Adam to have any clue when his Sabbath Day is
to end. Since a day is an indeterminate period of time, Adam has
no way of knowing when the next Sabbath occurs in the next weekly
cycle. If Hugh Ross does not know what a day is, then how is he
able to plug a year into the speed of light formula?<BR>
Hugh Ross' Adam cannot tell time!</P>

<P>3. Hugh Ross has born false witness (one of the 10 Commandments)
by lying and misrepresenting virtually ALL of the Church Fathers
he says support his view of days in Creation being long ages.
He further has lied about the positions held by the majority of
the signatories of the Westminster Confession.</P>

<P>4. Hugh Ross has &quot;gone the way of Cain&quot; (Jude 1:11).
&quot;Woe to them&quot;. The way of Cain says did God say you
can offer dead plants (grain offering) as atonement for sin, because
plants die just like animals? Or did God say only a dead animal
(shed blood) is an acceptable offering for the remission of sin.
The answer is clear!</P>

<P>5. Hugh Ross suggests that we can obtain information for the
conduct of our lives from the stars which are SILENT. While the
Bible tells us through the Apostle Paul that faith cometh by HEARING.
How does one believe on one whom they have not heard? (Romans
10:14-8). If the stars are on equal footing with the Bible, then
why weren't the astrologers able to interpret the King Nebuchadnezzar's
dream? And why does the Bible condemn seeking guidance from the
stars otherwise known as astrology. Which stars tells us we are
a sinner? Which stars predict judgment or future events? The answer:
ONLY the bright and morning star.</P>

<P>6. Hugh Ross submits that what can't be learned from the stars
can be learned from nature. This is pantheism. Are stars and nature
(his 67th book of the Bible) able to reprove, correct, and instruct
in all righteousness?</P>

<P>7. Hugh Ross suggests that the physics God created holds the
universe together. This is not true JESUS CHRIST holds everything
together.</P>

<P>8. You judge a tree by its fruit. Hugh Ross' tree is laden
with the evolutionary fruit of the geologic column. Can a thorn
bush produce figs? Why does he seek the counsel of the ungodly?</P>

<P>9. Hugh Ross's version of Noah's Flood has moved the boundaries
God has set in Psalms 104:9.</P>

<P>10. In Hugh Ross' pre-Adam world, unreasoning hominid animals
of brute instinct were able to roam and fill the whole earth,
yet Man who as Jesus said is better than the birds, is not smart
enough to figure out how to have populated the earth outside of
Mesopotamia or escape a local flood.</P>

<P>11. Hugh Ross' faulty interpretation of God's past works paves
the way to a faulty assessment of Biblical history and God's predicted
future events in eschatology, in which figurative use of language
disintegrates virtually any possibility that God ever meant anything
literally and straightforwardly.</P>

<P>12. Hugh Ross' Adam did not die physically for sinning. God's
Adam returns to the dust because of sinning. And this is not physical
death? Where else in Scripture does death NOT mean physical death?</P>

<P>13. Hugh Ross is able to measure the Universe and God, yet
Job, Jeremiah, and Isaiah, say the opposite. You asked for the
verse in Ecclesiastes which talks about what is unfathomable to
man. I believe you are referring to Ecc. 3:11-12. Is Hugh Ross
smarter than the wisest man who ever lived, that is Solomon who
stated that man can not fathom (or measure) what God has done
from the beginning to the end? Ecc. 3:11-12</P>

<P>I must finally commend you and support you in exposing and
reproving Hugh Ross who calls himself a brother, if indeed he
is a brother. Woe to them that call good evil, and evil good,
which is exactly how he has described his pre-Adamic world.</P>

<P>I hope that these final thoughts contribute to you concluding
remarks on our commentary on Hugh Ross' theology.</P>

<P>God bless you richly, and thank you again for the opportunity
to serve you and work with you.</P>

<P>If the Lord leads, perhaps in some ways, I can enlarge your
tent and help you further expand your ministry throughout the
world and to the ends of the earth and take some of your overflow
invitations!</P>

<P>God bless you dear brother,</P>

<P><B>Basic Problems:</B></P>

<P>We need Hugh Ross to tell us what the Bible says. <BR>
ICR has offered to debate Hugh and he refused Hugh's Position
is unscriptural, Hugh's thinking and Bible study is crippled by
and evolutionary bias- see Col 2:8 &quot;He has been spoiled by
a heathen philosophy.&quot;</P>

<P>He appeals to secular authority instead of scripture. <BR>
You are doing what Satan did in the garden of Eden- Yea hath God
said-six days? <BR>
If it does not mean six days then any interpretation of the Bible
is hopeless and we all need a guru like you to tell us what it
means. You have become a barrier between the average Bible believer
and his Bible just as the priests of other religions have done.</P>

<P>Magicians rely on dazzling the audience in order to deceive.
Ex. Kids with laser are unable to comprehend what is happening
to them. Rossites dazzle with high-sounding quotes and appeals
to authority.</P>

<P><B>Questions to ask:</B><BR>
Debate w/ Hugh Ross 7-27<BR>
Thanks for doing this.<BR>
Main points seem to be: Majority Opinion - starlight. <BR>
How do you explain the observed changes in the speed of light?
<B><BR>
Light-year is a distance not a time!</B></P>

<P>Why you believe the earth/universe is billions of years old?</P>

<P>According to your gospel:<B><BR>
Did God literally make Adam from the dust of the ground and breathe
into his nostrils the breath of life?<BR>
Was Eve really made from a rib?</B><BR>
Did Adam live to be 930 years old as we know years today?</P>

<P>If Adam had not sinned would he have died?<BR>
What effects did Adam's sin have on the creation?<BR>
Where does the Bible teach this? <BR>
Was the flood of Noah worldwide? You say it was &quot;universal&quot;.
Isn't this deceptive rhetoric for you followers? Why not spell
out what you mean clearly? <BR>
Why didn't people migrate out of Mesopotamia over the thousands
of years?</P>

<P>Was there animal or Neanderthal death before sin?<BR>
Gen. 1:29 Did Animals eat meat before Adam sinned?<B><BR>
Were dinosaurs made on day 5? fish or fowl on day 6- when were
animals?</B></P>

<P>Since thorns and thistles are found in the fossil record when
did they begin to grow on earth?<BR>
What does Acts 3:19 mean?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&quot;Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out, when <B>the times of refreshing</B> shall
come from the presence of the Lord; <BR>
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
you: 21 Whom the heaven must receive until <B>the times of restitution
of all things,</B> which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
holy prophets since the world began.&quot;</P>

<P>Does this mean that He will restore all things to conditions
of suffering and death that we already have today? If God will
restore all things does that mean there will be suffering, bloodshed,
disease, tears and death for millions of years? How will we get
&quot;incorruptible&quot; bodies in the twinkling of an eye?</P>

<P>I Cor. 15: &quot;Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not
all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall
sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put
on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 O death, where
is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 56 The sting of death
is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to
God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</P>

<P>Do you feel the Lord will come soon and why? Is the 6000th
year drawing near? What about the urgency that many feel for the
coming of the Lord?</P>

<P>In Gen. 1:31 God said He was done, what did He mean?<BR>
How do you explain fossil graveyards? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Polystrata fossils? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinosaurs? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behemoth? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragon stories? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant insects in the fossil record? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Human artifacts in coal and under table mountain?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;200 foot thick coal seams? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentry's polonium halos? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska 300 foot trees buried standing up under 1000
feet of permafrost? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice layers? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil formation? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sahara? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we still have comets? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there so little sediment on the ocean floor?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe the ocean floor has magnetic lines
that have reversed? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If a day is not a day, what is an evening? Morning?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the hundreds of times evening or morning is used
in the Bible please name 1 where it is not talking about a normal
24 hr day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is a pre Adamic worldwide flood <B>no problem</B>
for you even though it is <B>never mentioned</B> in the Bible
yet the one that is <B>clearly taught in the days of Noah</B>
is such a problem? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Sabbath was made for man as Jesus said how
long was this day?</P>

<P>Hugh claims that nature is God's 67th book. <B>Nature is not
the 67th book!</B> We must go by God's written word since we cannot
know God by nature alone.</P>

<P>Ecc. 8:17 &quot;Then I beheld all <B>the work of God, that
a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun:</B>
because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find
it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall
he not be able to find it.&quot;</P>

<P><B>When you look at nature you cannot tell</B> what God is
doing. 3:10-11 Cannot tell what God is doing from beginning to
end. Ps 40:5</P>

<P>&quot;Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou
hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: <B>they cannot
be reckoned up</B> in order unto thee: if I would declare and
speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.&quot;</P>

<P>II Thes. 2:8-12 &quot;And then shall that Wicked be revealed,
whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and
shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose
coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs
and lying wonders, and with all <B>deceivableness</B> of unrighteousness
in them that perish; because <B>they received not the love of
the truth,</B> that they might be saved. And for this cause <B>God
shall send them strong delusion,</B> that they should believe
a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</P>

<P>The penalty for not accepting God's truth is delusion. The
text says <B>delusion</B> not <B>illusion.</B> Illusion is a trick
in the object itself that affects its reality. A delusion is a
trick in the mind of the observer. <BR>
If you don't believe what God has revealed in his word you will
be deluded by nature.</P>

<P><I>The Genesis Question</I></P>

<P><B>Serious biblical and scientific errors deceive evangelicals
into thinking that billions of years are 'OK'.</B></P>

<P><B>Published by NavPress Publishing Group</B><BR>
P.O. Box 35001, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80935</P>

<P>by Jonathan Sarfati</P>

<P>From <I>Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal</I> 13(2):22-30,
1999.</P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>The astronomer Hugh N. Ross now seems to be the world's most
prominent 'progressive creationist' (PC). While he is insistent
about distinguishing himself from 'theistic evolutionists' (TEs),
Ross adopts the same basic philosophical approach. That is, he
makes uniformitarian (i.e. essentially materialistic, billions
of years, etc.) 'science' his authority over Scripture.</P>

<P>This means that he must try to fit billions of years into Scripture,
with corollaries of a local flood and pre-Adamite soulless man-like
creatures, and death of <I>nephesh</I> animals before sin. The
only real difference between the two positions is that PCs deny
transformism, the changing of one kind into another. Amazingly,
Ross claims that his approach is <I>'a literal reading of the
Genesis creation chapters'</I> (p. 86). This is surely a very
non-literal usage of the word 'literal'!</P>

<P>Ross's popularity in evangelical Christendom is based on several
factors:</P>

<P>* His books are published by the <B>once-biblical NavPress,
the publishing arm of the Navigators.</B> <BR>
* Ross name-drops a number of Christian leaders who appear not
to realize that Ross's departure from Scripture involves far more
than the age of the earth.</P>

<P>It's clear that for the last few years, NavPress has opposed
straightforward biblical creation. In this latest Ross book, NavPress
appear to have even resorted to somewhat misleading marketing
tactics, i.e., the dust-jacket has some 'praise' from allegedly
prominent authors, one of whom is:</P>

<P>SAMUEL CONNER, PH.D.<I><BR>
candidate in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</I></P>

<P>Formatted as above (starting a new line and changing the font
style from small capitals to italics after 'Ph.D.'), this gives
the first impression to a skimming reader that Conner has a Ph.D.,
because only after careful inspection is it clear that he is a
Ph.D. <I>candidate,</I> i.e. not actually qualified.</P>

<P><B>The canonization of 'Nature'</B></P>

<P>The worst part of Ross's teaching is the gross liberties he
takes with the scriptural text. He does this to fit the canonical
66 books into what he calls the '67th book', nature. (1) What
he means by 'nature' is the <I>uniformitarian</I> interpretation
of nature. However, the creation is cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans
8:20-22) and man's heart is deceitful (Jeremiah 17:9) and the
thinking of a godless man is 'futile' (Romans 1:21), while Scripture
itself is 'God-breathed' (2 Timothy 3:15-17). So a biblical Christian
should not re-interpret the perfect, unfallen Word of God according
to fallible theories of sinful humans about a world we know to
be cursed (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:20-22).</P>

<P>Ross's heterodox canonization of nature has been thoroughly
rebutted by Van Bebber and Taylor. (2) This book is essential
reading for defenders of the biblical world-view, as it answers
point-by-point Ross's earlier theological and historical errors.
(1) However, <I>The Genesis Question</I> repeats many of the same
errors.</P>

<P><B>Ignorance of Hebrew</B></P>

<P>Ross routinely gives audiences the impression of being very
familiar with Hebrew. However, in a meeting with Dr. Ross on 12
April 1999, Dr Russell Humphreys asked Ross in <B>Hebrew:</B>
<I>'Do you speak Hebrew?'</I> and Ross was clearly non-comprehending.
Humphreys then said (in English): <I>'You must respond in Hebrew'</I>,
to which Ross admitted his inability by responding (also in English)
<I>'I can't.'</I> Humphreys hastens to add that he himself is
not expert in Hebrew, and nor am I, but we at least know enough
to understand the question and to reply using the Hebrew word
for <I>'no'.</I></P>

<P>Ross's ignorance of Hebrew shows when he tries to discredit
the common creationist identification of <I>behemoth</I> in Job
40:15-24 with a sauropod, because he believes the dinosaurs became
extinct 65 million years ago. Ross writes (p. 48): <I>'The Hebrew
word for &quot;behemoth&quot; appears in its plural form, behema,
...'</I> However, even beginners in Hebrew know that -a is often
a feminine singular and -oth is a feminine plural. So Ross got
it back-to-front: <I>behema</I> is the singular form, while behemoth
is grammatically plural. It is a figure of speech known as an
<I>intensive plural</I> or <I>plural of majesty,</I> where 'the
referent is a singular individual, which is, however, so thoroughly
characterized by the qualities of the noun that a plural is used',
(3) 'beast of beasts'. The context says that <I>behemoth</I> is
the largest beast God made. And Job 40:17 says: <I>'His tail sways
like a cedar'</I> which certainly doesn't fit Ross's suggestion
of a hippopotamus (unless it was a bonsai cedar, maybe).</P>

<P><B>Fanciful eisegesis</B> (4)</P>

<P>One of Ross's major aims is to show that Genesis can be fitted
into uniformitarian astronomy and paleontology. To avoid the plain
teaching of Genesis - that land dinosaurs were created with man
and after whales, Ross also claims (pp. 52-53):</P>

<P><I>'The list [of creatures created on Day 6] does not purport
to include all the land mammals God made. ... Though</I> remes
<I>refers occasionally in Hebrew literature to reptiles, the opening
phrase of </I>Genesis 1:25<I> makes it clear that these are mammals.
... Both</I> behema <I>and</I> chayyah <I>refer to long-legged
land quadrupeds. The former group encompasses those that easily
can be tamed or domesticated for agricultural purposes, and the
latter, those that are difficult to tame but have the potential
to become excellent pets.</I> Remes <I>refers to short-legged
land mammals, such as rodents, hares, and armadillos.'</I></P>

<P>However, this is typical of Ross's imaginative eisegesis. Genesis
1:25 teaches nothing so restrictive. And his analysis of Hebrew
terms has no basis - <B>Ross's own source</B>, the <I>Theological
Wordbook of the Old Testament</I> (TWOT), (5 <B>doesn't support
him.</B> <I>Chayyah</I> is simply a generic word for a living
creature although it <I>can</I> often refer to wild animals (TWOT
1:281) - the phrase <I>nephesh chayyah</I> is used of sea creatures
in Genesis 1:20, and of man in Genesis 2:7. <I>Behema</I> refers
to <I>both</I> wild beast <I>and</I> domesticated animal (TWOT
1:92). <I>Remes</I> describes small creeping animals 'especially
reptiles' (TWOT 2:850). The TWOT shows that Ross is 'over-defining'
these terms.</P>

<P>Van Bebber and Taylor pointed out the same errors in Ross's
earlier book, and it's tiresome to see Ross repeating discredited
nonsensical arguments time after time.</P>

<P>Note that even if we grant Ross's contention that <I>remes</I>
means 'short-legged land mammals', it <I>still</I> doesn't match
the uniformitarian order in the fossil record. Such creatures
are alleged to have appeared millions of years before whales,
which Ross identifies as created on the millions-of-years-long
'Day 5'. And mesonychids, the alleged predecessors of whales,
were certainly 'long-legged mammalian quadrupeds', so would fit
even Ross's descriptions of 6th-day creatures.</P>

<P>Those who promote Ross's material as sound science should thus
think again. It is doubtful that secular people will be impressed
by Ross's claim that the order of Genesis matches 'science'. When
they point out exceptions, Ross redefines terms so that Day 6
doesn't really refer to any creature that appeared before whales.
And when all else fails, he claims that the 'days' overlapped.
(7)</P>

<P><B>Insightful exegesis or delusions of grandeur?</B></P>

<P>One key point about Ross's 'harmony' of Genesis with billions
of years is to claim that Genesis 1:2 ff. is written from the
viewpoint of an observer at the earth's surface. He claims (p.
21):</P>

<P><I>'The frame of reference, or point of view, for the creation
account suddenly shifts in Genesis 1:2, from the heavenlies that
make up the entire physical universe to the surface of planet
Earth. For whatever reason, perhaps because it comes so abruptly,
most readers - even scholarly commentators - miss the shift. I
am convinced that my absorption in science prepared me to see
it.'</I></P>

<P>So Ross, despite a demonstrable ignorance of even the most
basic Hebrew and an inability to use Hebrew lexicons correctly,
discovers amazing insights, thanks to 'science'. This claim by
Ross, like so many others, is a denial of the perspicuity of Scripture.
I.e., God's people were left entirely in the dark about Genesis
until modern uniformitarian theories were invented - mainly by
bibliosceptics.</P>

<P>More likely, this alleged frame shift has been missed because
it is not in the text! The real frame-shift to the Earth is very
clear in the Hebrew, and occurs in Genesis 2:4, not Genesis 1:2.
Genesis 1:12:3 is a summarized account of the whole creation,
while Genesis 2:4 ff. focuses on the creation of mankind (in chapters
7 and 10, Ross rightly rejects higher critical theories that claim
that Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory creation accounts). This
shift is clear from the boundary marking phrase 'These <I>are</I>
the generations (<I>toledoth</I>) of the heavens and of the earth',
or better, 'This is the account ...'. Also, in Genesis 2:4 , the
order 'heaven and earth' changes to 'earth and heaven', alerting
the reader to focus on the earth.</P>

<P>Ross applies this alleged Genesis 1:2 frame shift to assert
that what really happened on the fourth 'day' was that the sun
and other heavenly bodies 'appeared' when a dense cloud layer
dissipated after millions of years.</P>

<P>Disks around stars, by an amazing leap in logic, supposedly
show that all planets, including the Earth, started with opaque
atmospheres of hydrogen, helium, methane and ammonia (p. 26).
But it would not take a very sophisticated knowledge of science
to know that hydrogen couldn't be held by earth's gravity, and
methane and ammonia would be photolysed quickly. These gases are
transparent, incidentally.</P>

<P>Ross's ideas are not only fanciful science, but bad exegesis
of Hebrew. The Hebrew word <I>'asah</I> means 'make' throughout
Genesis 1, and may be used interchangeably with 'create' (<I>bara'</I>),
e.g. in Genesis 1:26-27. It is pure desperation to apply a different
meaning to the same word in the same grammatical construction
in the same passage, just to fit in with atheistic evolutionary
ideas. If God had <I>meant</I> 'appeared', then He would have
<I>used</I> the Hebrew word for appear (<I>ra'ah</I>), as when
the dry land 'appeared' as the waters gathered in one place on
Day 3 (Genesis 1:9). This is supported by Hebrew scholars who
have translated the Bible into English. <B>Over 20 major translations
were checked, and all clearly teach that the sun, moon and stars
were </B><I>made<B> on the fourth day.</B></I></P>

<P>See also How could the days of Genesis 1 be literal if the
Sun wasnt created until the fourth day?</P>

<P><B>Days of Creation</B></P>

<P>To justify his interpretation of the six creation days of Genesis
1 as millions of years long, Ross writes (p. 65):</P>

<P><I>'In English, the word day enjoys flexible usage. We refer
to the day of the dinosaurs and the day of the Romans, and no-one
misunderstands our meaning. But we recognize this usage as figurative,
acknowledging just two literal definitions: a twenty-four hour
period, from midnight to midnight, and the daylight hours (roughly
twelve, but varying from one latitude and season to another).'</I></P>

<P>Because 'day' (Hebrew <I>y&ocirc;m</I>) in some contexts can
have a non-literal meaning, Ross feels justified in assuming that
a non-literal meaning is acceptable in the <I>particular context</I>
of Genesis 1. But such an interpretation shows that he could benefit
from elementary training in exegesis, e.g. the book <I>Exegetical
Fallacies</I> (10) by the evangelical New Testament scholar Dr
Don Carson. Ross commits a classic case of a fallacy that Carson
called:</P>

<P><B><I>'Unwarranted expansion of an expanded semantic field.</I>
The fallacy in this instance lies in the supposition that the
meaning of the word in a specific context is much broader than
the context itself allows and may bring with it the word's entire
semantic range.'</B></P>

<P>Ross's fallacy can be illustrated by the following sentence
that has several uses of the word 'day'.</P>

<P><I>'In my father's </I><B>day,<I> he would go to bed early
Sunday </I></B>evening<I> and rise early in the </I><B>morning<I>
of the following </I></B>day,<I> and spend the next six </I><B>days<I>
travelling, during the </I></B>day,<I> to cross the whole country.'</I></P>

<P>Of course 'my father's day' is an indefinite period of time.
But this doesn't mean that it's legitimate to interpret the 'six
days traveling' as anything but ordinary days. And the combination
of evening and the next morning are another way of showing that
his bedtime was contained in one ordinary day, not an indefinite
time period.</P>

<P>Genesis 1 modifies the creation days with both 'evening and
morning' <B>and</B> a number, almost as if God was trying to make
it as obvious as possible that they were ordinary days. Exodus
20:8-11 reinforces the point that the six days of creation followed
by a day of 'rest' were the basis for the Israelites' six-day
week and seventh day Sabbath. The phrase 'during the day' is also
obviously the daylight hours, as per Genesis 1:5.</P>

<P>Ross also claims (p. 65): <I>'In biblical Hebrew, no other
word besides y&ocirc;m carries the meaning of a long period of
time'</I> and cites his own book and TWOT. Again, Van Bebber and
Taylor pointed out that <I>Ross's own source contradicts him,</I>
stating that the Hebrew <I>olam</I> and its Greek equivalent <I>aion</I>
(from which we derive the word 'eon') <I>often</I> means 'long
age'. There were plenty of other words that God could have used
if He had wanted to teach long periods of time. God could also
have used phrases like 'x myriad myriad years ago' to teach ages
of hundreds of millions of years. For a less precise indication
of vast ages, God could have compared the years to the number
of sand grains or stars. Yet God did not use any of these - rather,
He emphasized literal days.</P>

<P><B>Does the seventh day continue?</B></P>

<P>Ross claims on p. 64:</P>

<P><I>'Each of the six creation days closes with the refrain:
&quot;There was evening, and there was morning,&quot; then the
day's number. The statement suggests that each day had a start
time ... and an end time. However, the refrain is not attached
to the seventh day. Its closure is missing.</I></P>

<P><I>... its absence from the account of the seventh day can
be taken as a meaningful hint: the day has not ended.'</I></P>

<P>From this, Ross has concluded that the other creation days
could be long ages. However, the systematic theologian, Dr Douglas
Kelly, responded to the same argument from Ross as follows:</P>

<P><I>'To say the least, this places a great deal of theological
weight on a very narrow and thin exegetical bridge! Is it not
more concordant with the patent sense of the context of Genesis
2 (and Exodus 20) to infer that because the Sabbath differed in
quality (though not - from anything we can learn out of the text
itself - in quantity), a slightly different concluding formula
was appended to indicate a qualitative difference (six days involved
work; one day involved rest)? The formula employed to show the
termination of that first sabbath:</I> &quot;And on the seventh
day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the
seventh day from all His work which He had made&quot;<I> (Genesis
2:2) seems just as definite as that of </I>&quot;and the evening
and the morning were the first day&quot;.'</P>

<P>Ross also argues that Hebrews 4:1-11 teaches <I>'that the seventh
creation day began after the creation of Adam and Eve, continues
through the present, and extends into the future.'</I> However,
again Ross repeats an argument rebutted by Van Bebber and Taylor.
Hebrews never says that the <I>seventh day of creation</I> is
continuing to the present; it merely says that God's <I>rest</I>
is continuing. If someone says on Monday that he rested on Saturday
and is still resting, it in no way implies that Saturday lasted
until Monday. Kulikovsky carefully analyses the grammar of Hebrews
4 and concludes:</P>

<P><I>'The &quot;rest&quot; of Hebrews 4 clearly refers to the
Kingdom of God ... Nowhere in the text is it equated with the
seventh day of creation, nor is there any grammatical or contextual
data suggesting any such equation.'</I></P>

<P><B>The history of mankind</B></P>

<P>A straightforward reading of the biblical genealogies according
to the reliable Masoretic text shows that Adam was created about
4000 BC, and this was on the 6th day of creation. And Jesus said:
<I>'But </I><B>from the beginning of the creation<I> God made
them male and female'</I></B> (Mark 10:6), not billions of years
later. But Ross dates Adam at about 35,000-47,000 BC, based on
secular chromosome research (p. 111) i.e. almost at the <B>end</B>
of billions-of-years old creation.</P>

<P>Since he also accepts the 'earlier' evolutionary 'dates' for
other hominids, Ross concludes that they have no relationship
to man, although they buried their dead, made tools and musical
instruments, painted pictures, etc.</P>

<P><I>Biblical genealogies</I></P>

<P>Ross (pp. 108-110) points to some biblical genealogies that
have gaps to claim that the Genesis 5 and 11 genealogies are largely
incomplete. He also claims (p. 109):</P>

<P><I>'The words translated in to English say this: &quot;When
X had lived Y years, he became the father of Z.&quot; Someone
reading the same passage in Hebrew would see a second possibility:
&quot;When X had lived Y years, he became the father of a family
line that included or culminated in Z.&quot;'</I></P>

<P>However, none of Ross's examples of gaps in genealogies (Matthew
1:89 <I>vs</I> 1 Chronicles 3:10-12) mention the age of the father
at the birth of the next name in the line, so are irrelevant.</P>

<P>Ross also points out that father can mean grandfather or ancestor,
while son can mean grandson or descendant. But Ross again errs
by <I>unwarranted expansion of an expanded semantic field.</I>(10)
The (Genesis 5 and 11) genealogies say that X 'begat sons and
daughters' implying that Z is likewise a son of X <I>in this specific
context.</I></P>

<P>And even if we grant that Z is a descendant of X, Z is always
preceded by the accusative particle <I>'et,</I> which is not translated
but marks Z as the direct object of the verb 'begat' (<I>wayyoled</I>).
This means that the begetting of Z by X still occurred when X
was Y years old, <I>regardless</I> of whether Z was a son or a
more distant descendant. The Hebrew grammar provides further support
- <I>wayyoled</I> is the <I>hiphil</I> waw-consecutive imperfect
form of the Hebrew verb <I>yalad</I> - the <I>hiphil</I> stem
communicates the <I>subject participating in action that causes
an event</I> e.g. Seth as the begetter of Enosh. No wonder the
Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (AD 37/38-c. 100) saw no gaps
in the genealogy. (21, 22</P>

<P>James Barr, then Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford University,
wrote in 1984:</P>

<P><I>'... probably, so far as I know, there is no professor of
Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does
not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1-11 intended to convey
to their readers the ideas that: ... the figures contained in
the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology
from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical
story.'</I> (23)</P>

<P>Barr, consistent with his neo-orthodox views, does not <B>believe</B>
Genesis, but he understood what the Hebrew so clearly <B>taught.</B>
It was only the perceived need to harmonize with the alleged age
of the earth which led people to think anything different &atilde;
it was nothing to do with the text itself.</P>

<P>Ross also points out that Luke 3:36 has the extra name Cainan.
But this is spurious, because this name was probably not in the
original autograph, but inserted later, (24) certainly after the
time of Josephus. (25, 26)</P>

<P><B>Secular history</B></P>

<P>Ross also uncritically claims that missionaries teaching a
literal Genesis were discredited by:</P>

<P><I>'Chinese historical accounts placing Chinese national origins
earlier than 4004 BC. ... The same reaction comes today from ...
Australian Aborigines, who date back to 25,000 BC .... All are
firmly established dates.' (p. 108).</I></P>

<P>However, the <I>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</I> says on China:
<I>'The first dynasty for which there is definite historical material
is the Shang, or Yin (18th-12th BC).'</I> (27) The Australian
Aborigines were an oral culture, without writing, so their 'dates'
are not based on historical records but on 'dating methods'. However,
some of these claim that Aborigines existed before even Ross's
'date' for Adam - what will happen to his apologetics if such
dates become widely accepted?</P>

<P><B>Floundering on the Flood</B></P>

<P>Some Ross supporters like Dr James Dobson, of <I>Focus on the
Family,</I> evidently believe the overwhelming biblical evidence
for a global Flood, but fail to see the inconsistency of this
position with billions of years. A global Flood would have laid
down a vast thickness of fossil-bearing sedimentary rock in a
year, which would nullify much geological 'evidence' for billions
of years. Conversely, accepting that the fossil record was formed
over billions of years eliminates any evidence for the Flood.
Ross is more consistent, and believes the Flood was restricted
to Mesopotamia.</P>

<P><I>Local Flood arguments</I></P>

<P>Ross points out that there are passages where 'all the earth'
and 'whole world' are used in a non-global way. Again, Ross is
guilty of unwarranted expansion of an expanded semantic field.
(10) In the Flood account, the frequency of the Hebrew word kol
(all, every) indicates that God is going out of his way to emphasize
the universality of the Flood. (28) Genesis 7, NIV reads:</P>

<P><I>19 'They rose greatly on the earth, and </I><B>all<I> the
high mountains under the </I></B>entire<I> heavens were covered.
...</I></P>

<P><I>21 </I><B>Every<I> living thing that moved on the earth
perished - birds, livestock, wild animals, </I></B>all<I> the
creatures that swarm over the earth, and </I><B>all<I> mankind.</I></B></P>

<P><B><I>22 </I></B>Everything<I> on dry land that had the breath
of life in its nostrils died.</I></P>

<P><I>23 </I><B>Every<I> living thing on the face of the earth
was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along
the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth.
</I></B>Only<I> Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.'</I></P>

<P>A question could be asked of Ross: 'Just suppose, for the sake
of the argument, that God had wanted to teach a global Flood -
how could He have said it more clearly than in Genesis 7?'</P>

<P><I>Too little room for the animals?</I></P>

<P>Ross caricatures belief in a global Flood, parroting discredited
skeptical/atheistic arguments against the Ark. Ross ignores key
books like John Woodmorappe <I>Noah's Ark -- a Feasibility Study</I>,
(29) which answers nearly all his objections.</P>

<P><I>Kinds and species</I></P>

<P>Creationists, arguing from the text of Genesis, believe that
Noah took two of every kind of land vertebrate animal. Ross distorts
this into a claim that creationists believe two of <I>every single
species</I> had to go on board. He also claims that the fossil
record documents that <I>'half a billion to a billion new species
of life arose between the Cambrian explosion ... and the arrival
of human beings'</I> (p. 150). But the number of <I>actually cataloged</I>
fossil species is only about 200,000, about 95 % of which were
marine invertebrates which Noah was not required to take on board
anyway. The 'billion' is probably estimated from the transitional
forms needed if neo-Darwinism were true, and even then is a huge
exaggeration. And it's likely that many so-called fossil species
and even genera within a family were merely varieties of a single
polytypic 'biological species'. This is true today, as shown by
many cases of hybridization between members of different 'genera'.
(30)</P>

<P>Ross regurgitates the skeptical nonsense that it was impossible
to derive all current species from the relatively few kinds on
board the Ark, unless super-rapid evolution occurred. Ross effectively
believes in fixity of species, in ignorance of proven speciation
within a kind. (31) Skeptics would thus find him an easy target.</P>

<P>However, not all change is evolution, in the sense of molecules-to-man,
which requires an increase of genetic information, just as not
all monetary transactions are automatically profitable ones. Many
varieties can arise rapidly from an initial population with large
genetic variety. If this population splits into isolated small
populations, each subgroup may carry a fraction of the total genetic
information. Later information-losing mutations, e.g. in proteins
recognizing 'imprinting' marks, (32, 33) can result in reproductive
isolation, thus a separate 'biological species'.</P>

<P>Rapid production of 'varieties' can be shown in humans: it
is well known that a marriage between two mulattos (people with
one black and one white parent each) can produce children with
a large variety of skin colors. Of course it couldn't happen quickly
by <I>evolutionary</I> means, because they must rely on random
mutations to generate <I>new genes,</I> and slow substitution
over many generations to establish them in the population. (34)</P>

<P>This is why both Eskimos and native equatorial south Americans
have mid-brown skins and haven evolved very white or very dark
skins - the relevant information is simply not present. Such 'people
groups' today are highly specialized, with less genetic variation
than mulattos (and Adam and Eve), which is why they produce offspring
of limited variety.</P>

<P>Because of Ross's lack of knowledge of genetics, he postulates
direct divine intervention at Babel to introduce 'racial' traits
into separate populations (pp. 177-178). The Bible doesn't even
hint at this. Ross admits that it's a 'God of the gaps' explanation,
which would be unnecessary if he had read any of our books. Ross
says that the different 'racial' characteristics were designed
to aid man's dispersal. This is disturbing - although Ross does
repudiate racism and sees nothing wrong in 'inter-racial' marriages,
this theory almost implies that God designed racial prejudice.</P>

<P>If Ross had read basic creationist books, e.g. <I>Stones and
Bones, </I>The Answers Book or <I>What is Creation Science?</I>
[or seen the brief Internet article How could all the human races
come from Noah, his three sons and their wives?], he wouldn't
need to resort to such daft explanations, which hardly give the
would-be Christian apologist relying on his books any credibility.</P>

<P><I>'Fear of the millions'</I></P>

<P>Ross claims that a main motivation of those opposing billions
of years is fear that it would make evolution possible, hence
the above subheading on p. 92. As usual, Ross's claim betrays
a willing ignorance of creationist literature as well as ignorance
of evolution/variation as shown above. Many years before Ross
wrote any of his books, leading creationists like Dr Duane Gish
made it very clear that they believed the earth was only thousands
of years old, on both biblical and scientific grounds. But Gish
also strongly pointed out that evolution would be impossible even
if billions of years were granted, e.g.:</P>

<P><I>'Therefore, whether the earth is ten thousand, ten million,
or ten billion years old, the fossil record does not support the
general theory of evolution.' (</I>35<I>)</I></P>

<P><I>'Considering an enzyme, then, of 100 amino acids, there
would be no possibility whatever that a single molecule could
have arisen by pure chance on earth in five billion years.' (</I>36<I>)</I></P>

<P><I>The need for the Ark</I></P>

<P>Why would God have told Noah to build an ocean-liner-sized
Ark just to escape a local Flood? Noah could easily have migrated.
Why bother to take birds, when many can fly hundreds of miles
in a day? Ross 'explains' (p. 160):</P>

<P><I>'First, when God pours out judgment, He gives ample warning
ahead of time. He sends a spokesperson, a prophet, and gives that
prophet a kind of platform from which to be heard. For the antediluvians,
Noah was that prophet and the scaffolding around the Ark was his
platform.'</I></P>

<P>Another Ross flight of fancy - what other prophet needed a
'platform', let alone one requiring such a huge expenditure of
labor?</P>

<P><I>'Straw man' and 'guilt by association' arguments</I></P>

<P>Ross often misrepresents what creationists believe and have
clearly stated. For example (p. 148):</P>

<P><I>'Some global flood proponents who acknowledge the problem
of a grossly inadequate water supply propose that Earth's surface
was &quot;smoothed,&quot; or flattened, by the Flood, thus reducing
the water requirement. More specifically, they claim that during
the forty days and nights when the floodwaters rose, Earth's mountains
radically eroded from their lofty heights of ten fifteen and even
twenty thousand feet to just one or two thousand feet, perhaps
less.'</I></P>

<P>This is totally inexcusable, because Ken Ham had responded
to a similar Ross misrepresentation (which was even then inexcusable)
well before <I>The Genesis Question</I> was published:</P>

<P><I>'In my 20 years of involvement in creation ministry, I have
never known of</I> <B>any</B> <I>material from any Biblical creationists
indicating that God &quot;eroded the mountains from a height of
30,000 feet down to sea level during the forty days&quot;! ...
Biblical creationists believe that most mountains today did not
exist before the Flood, but were raised up (and ocean basins sank)
towards the end of the Flood, thus causing the water to run off
to where it is today.' (</I>37<I>)</I></P>

<P>Akin to straw man arguments is guilt by association - Ross
complains that a TV documentary about the alleged discovery of
the 'Ark' gave the skeptics an easy target (pp. 165-167). The
obvious implication is that it's all the fault of global Flood
proponents, although the major global Flood organizations have
repudiated such claimed discoveries. (38) Many creationists even
agree with Ross that the Ark is unlikely to be found because its
timber would probably have been used for construction, so that
is hardly a unique local-floodist insight.</P>

<P>Ross also copies the ploy of the apostate Ron Numbers, (39)
attributing biblical creationism and flood geology to <I>'the
visions of an Adventist prophetess [Ellen White]'</I> via George
McCready Price. A number of papers by Dr Terry Mortenson in the
Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal show that the early 19th
century Scriptural Geologists presented such ideas well before
Price [see The 19th Century Scriptural Geologists, by Dr Terry
Mortenson]. Ken Ham pointed out that he had never even heard of
Price at the time he founded CSF/AiG, and that he adopted creationism
because of the biblical teaching. (37) Even if Ross were right
about Price, he is wrong to think that discrediting Price is enough
to refute creationism &atilde; this is a classic case of the genetic
fallacy.</P>

<P>With such serious logical fallacies in Ross's book, it is astonishing
that it was endorsed by Christian philosopher J.P. Moreland, who
is usually very astute at spotting such fallacies. (Did he actually
read it?).</P>

<P><I>Pitching the Ark?</I></P>

<P>Ross parrots another discredited argument from atheistic skeptics:
that it would be impossible to 'pitch' the Ark without millions
of years for petroleum products to accumulate (pp. 153-154). This
shows that Ross is unwilling to admit to his readers that biblical
creationists have already addressed most of his arguments long
ago. Dr Tas Walker pointed out 15 years ago that pitch need not
be made from petroleum at all - the pitch-making industries in
Europe made pitch from pine resin for centuries. (40) The <I>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</I> says about naval pitch: <I>'Oleoresin, </I><B>also
called gum or pitch<I> ... is extracted from the pine ...'</I></B>
(41)</P>

<P><I>Too much coal?</I></P>

<P>Like bibliosceptics, Ross claims that there is too much coal
in the earth's crust to have been formed in the Flood (pp. 151-154).
Even worse, as 'evidence' he cites some calculations from a CEN
Tech. J. paper, 'Too much coal for a young earth?' (42) However,
the whole point of this paper was to <B>solve</B> that problem,
by showing evidence that much coal had formed from large floating
ecosystems comprising arboreal lycopods, which had been catastrophically
buried by water. Ross also <B>omitted the question mark</B> when
citing the title, thus further conveying to his readers the <B>diametrically
opposite meaning</B> to the paper's intention. Also, John Woodmorappe
had shown long ago that vegetation living at the start of the
Flood was not the only possible source of carbonaceous material
which had eventually transformed into coal. There were about 1656
years between the Creation and Flood, enabling much peat to form,
which could have been buried by the Flood and easily transformed
into coal since.(43)</P>

<P><B>Death and the Fall</B></P>

<P>Since Ross accepts the billions of years, for consistency he
must believe that the death, suffering and disease shown by the
fossil record occurred well before Adam sinned. Thus Ross denies
the biblical teaching that death could not have been part of God's
'very good' creation (Genesis 1:31) because death is 'the last
enemy' (1 Corinthians 15:26).</P>

<P><I>Vegetarian diets</I></P>

<P>Ross agrees that Genesis 1:29 teaches that humans originally
had a vegetarian diet, not <I>'merely an indication that all food
resources derive from plants'</I> (p.71). But he 'explains':</P>

<P><I>'Vegetarianism perfectly suits the potential longevity of
the first humans. Animal tissue contains between ten and ten thousand
times the concentration of heavy elements that plant material
contains. This difference sounds drastic, but it poses an insignificant
health risk for people living only 120 years (the limit God imposed
at the time of the Flood). However, the difference is by no means
trivial for people living nearly a thousand years.'</I></P>

<P>Ross provides no documentation. How could he know what dangers
would face long-living people without any to test?! This statement
is falsified by the lifespans greatly exceeding 120 years long
after people were permitted to eat meat. And his statement is
hopelessly imprecise: <I>which</I> plants and animals? Some plants
take up heavy elements so readily that they are used to clean
up waterways. Soy and tea plants are known to take up aluminum
readily. Conversely, many animals can excrete such elements. And
accumulation is more of a problem in animals higher in the food
chain, e.g. sharks with mercury, as well as filter-feeders. This
might be a reason for the Mosaic laws against eating carnivores
and shellfish.</P>

<P>Also, Ross undercuts one of his own claims. Ross agrees that
Genesis 1:29 teaches original vegetarianism for humans, but then
surely <I>by his own reasoning,</I> the next verse must teach
original vegetarianism in land animals and birds. But Ross denies
this without realizing the contradiction, because he believes
that carnivore fossils pre-date Adam.</P>

<P><I>Plant Death</I></P>

<P>Ross points out that plants must have died before the Fall.
Again, he persistently misrepresents what creationists <I>actually
teach.</I> 37 We have <I>never</I> taught that <I>plants</I> or
<I>individual cells</I> didn't die before the Fall, but only <I>nephesh</I>
(soul) creatures. It should be obvious from Genesis 1:29-30 that
the Bible is clear that plants do <B>not</B> have life in the
sense of <I>nephesh,</I> while animals do.</P>

<P><B>Biological incompetence</B></P>

<P>It's perhaps understandable that Ross, whose major qualifications
are in astronomy, would not be an expert on biology. But it's
astounding that a man who specializes in supposedly scientific
apologetics, makes fundamental errors with even high-school level
genetics. His apparent ignorance of speciation is covered above,
but there are other areas where he does not understand basic genetics.</P>

<P><I>Human longevity</I></P>

<P>Ross does accept the biblical long life spans, and rejects
any redefinition of the word 'year' (a pity he isn't so careful
with the word 'day'). But in ch. 15, Ross interprets the 120 years
of Genesis 6:3 as shortening of human life-spans. This is clearly
fallacious because it contradicts other Scriptures showing that
people lived for hundreds of years well after the Flood. The best
understanding is that the 120 years was the time left for mankind
before the Flood would destroy it, with only a remnant surviving
on the Ark.</P>

<P>Ross's explanation for shortening human life spans is: God
supernaturally increased the rate of apoptosis (programmed cell
death) to 'protect' us from an increasing-with-age risk of cancer
in the aftermath of a radiation burst from the Vela supernova.
But it's bizarre to talk about 'protecting' people from cancer
should they reach 500, 600, even 900, by making sure they become
decrepit and die before 120! What next, 'protecting' people from
Alzheimer's disease at 80 by causing fatal heart attacks by 60?</P>

<P>A sensible physical explanation for the drop in longevity is
loss of 'longevity genes' by genetic drift because of the population
bottleneck at the Flood, and maybe other post-Babel bottlenecks
as well, but Ross's book ignores creationist literature and evidence
from gene studies. (44)</P>

<P><I>Cain's wife</I></P>

<P>Ross correctly believes that Adam's sons and daughters must
have intermarried, that such close intermarriage happened in Abraham's
time, and that God did not forbid this until Leviticus 18:6-18.
But his explanation is garbled (p. 105):</P>

<P><I>'Genetic defects as a result of intrafamily marriage develop
slowly. They would present no risk until after the first several
dozen generations.'</I></P>

<P>Aside from the inconsistency with his deviant view of <I>hundreds</I>
of generations between Adam and Abraham, this misunderstands the
problem of close intermarriage. It's not the intermarriages <I>per
se</I> that cause defects. Rather, there is a greater likelihood
of inheriting two recessive defective mutant genes in the same
locus, which would thus be expressed. Whereas if the parents were
more distantly related, the offspring would likely inherit defects
in <I>different</I> loci, each paired by a normal allele that
would mask the defect. But since Adam and Eve were created with
no defective genes, recessive mutations would take many more than
'several dozen generations' to accumulate to levels where close
intermarriage would be dangerous for the offspring.</P>

<P>See also: Where did Cain get his wife?</P>

<P><B>Other scientific fallacies</B></P>

<P>Some of Ross's arguments are blatantly circular, in effect:
'Isn't it amazing how modern uniformitarian science backs up what
Genesis says?' Hardly surprising, because Ross has re-interpreted
Genesis to fit in with uniformitarian science!</P>

<P>Ross strongly overstates the case for fine-tuning of the earth
and universe. He claims (p. 32) that Earth's gravity is strong
enough to hold lots of water vapor (relative molecular mass (Mr)
= 18), <I>'but not so high as to keep life threatening quantities
of ammonia [Mr = 17] and methane [Mr = 16].'</I> <B><I>Not true</I></B>
- earth's gravity even holds helium (Ar = 4) strongly (incidentally,
more helium from ?-decay is released into the atmosphere than
escapes into space, and the total amount in the atmosphere is
evidence that it is less than two million years old (45). We are
protected from methane and ammonia because they are rapidly destroyed
by UV light.</P>

<P>There are many other errors, even in Ross's own field of astronomy,
documented by the astronomy professor Danny Faulkner.(46)</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>I haven't covered all of Ross's errors in this review. This
would require a whole book, which is planned within a year. But
there is enough documentation here of his biblical and scientific
errors to show that Christians should not promote his books.</P>

<P><B>Dr. Hugh Ross: Apologist or Heretic?</B></P>

<P><B>Why Devote An Entire Page To A Man Revered Inside The Church?</B></P>

<P>Why would I, as a Christian, devote an entire web page to critiquing
the teachings and statements of Dr. Hugh Ross? After all, we have
other &quot;Christian&quot; ministers, teaching utter nonsense
and outright heresy and I haven't devoted a page to them. The
<B>RTB Statement of Faith</B> is orthodox although he does appear
to consider nature and Scripture as equal revelations which is
somewhat troubling. He also claims to agree with the statement
on inerrancy by the <B>International Council on Biblical Inerrancy</B>
although his teachings about creation are incompatible with such
a pronouncement. It is not his day-age theory or anything associated
with the age of the Earth debate that has troubled me. So, why
target the teachings of Dr. Ross and what exactly am I upset with?</P>

<P>Unlike the vast majority of people that are spewing nonsense
and heresy in the name of Christianity Dr. Ross appears to be
getting a free ride. He seems impervious to the normal criticisms
that would be leveled at anyone making the outlandish statements
that he has made concerning everything from the nature of God
to evidence for the Bible being God's word. Even Dr. William Lane
Craig's recent Philosophia Christi article which clearly documents
that Ross is teaching doctrines contrary to the ESSENTIALS of
the faith calls him &quot;EVANGELICALISM'S most important scientific
apologist&quot; (emphasis added). In Norman Geisler's *Bakers
Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics* he lists Ross along side
Augustine and Aquinas as great apologists. If he is teaching heresy
(which I believe I have soundly documented) then how can any Christian
still refer to him as an apologist for the faith? For a variety
of possible reasons Dr. Ross has become widely recognized within
the church with little critical review of his positions while
making increasingly absurd, false, heterodox and even heretical
claims. Since these comments seem to be going unchallenged and
he continues to be embraced by most of Christianity as a spokesman
for the faith I feel that someone needed to stand firm for honesty
and sound doctrine.</P>

<P>The best outcome would be for his repentance from these positions
and statements and to use his popularity to promote truth and
orthodoxy. It is my reverent hope that such a repentance will
take place but in the event that one is not forthcoming then the
body of believers needs to be forewarned about his theology, science
and misleading statements concerning a vast number of subjects.</P>

<P>A number of years ago I first noticed some very disturbing
statements by Dr. Ross, but it seemed that I was the only person
who was noticing. These statements appeared to include factual
misrepresentations of events, scientific blunders, dangerous heterodox
ideas and even outright heresy.</P>

<P>As I was trying to come to an understanding with Dr. Ross,
I found a number of other people who had gone before me. None
of these people were raising all of the issues that I was, but
they were raising some of these as well as additional issues.
As I followed the prescription of Scripture in resolving these
matters, I first approached Ross directly (through RTB). Unable
to resolve these matters, I approached some of the leaders within
the church to approach Ross with me. I was generally dismissed
by most of them, and while some people considered my documentation
of heretical statements interesting, almost no person of notoriety
within the church would stand with me and confront Ross. In frustration
over the matter, I published an open letter to Ross (after sending
him a copy of that letter, without response) on my web page.</P>

<P>Perhaps completely independent of my protestations, some very
notable Christian leaders have started taking notice of both the
heretical doctrines and absurd scientific pronouncements that
Ross has been making for years. I am hoping that by presenting
this information to the public, we can put enough pressure on
Ross to consider the counsel of his peers and retract many of
his outlandish statements.</P>

<P>Please keep in mind, as you read the links below, that some
of the material is dated. In the letter from Dr. Humphreys to CRS
he mentions that he and Dr. Ross had not communicated in years.There
was subsequently a number of letters exchanged with the first
Ross letter being sent in December 1997, AFTER I pointed out to
the RTB staff that their 4th Qtr 1997 newsletter was claiming
that Ross had had an ongoing discussion with Dr. Humphreys. The
newsletter also claimed that Ross had convened a panel of scientists
who confronted Dr. Humphreys. This also was false. There have
been additional exchanges since 1997 notably the CENTJ articles
in the Summer of 1998. While Ross claims those articles (which
he did not write) utterly destroyed the model of Dr. Humphreys,
those Physicists whom I know, that are sufficiently competent in
Relativity Theory to evaluate the dialog, have affirmed that
Dr. Humphreys acquitted himself and his model well.</P>

<P>Dear CRSnet people:</P>

<P>Thanks for sending me a copy of Bill Donahue's 5/21/97 post
about Hugh Ross's radio program. As reported in Bill's posting,
it appears that Ross has committed a number of &quot;Rossisms,&quot;
which I define as &quot;confident overstatements which are clearly
false&quot;. Below I will cite and correct four of the Rossisms
reported in the posting:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. &quot;[Ross claims] the book is full of mathematical errors&quot;.
False. As evidence I point out that Ross has yet to make such
claims in a peer-reviewed scientific journal where I can answer
him. Furthermore, since 1994 Ross has backed out of several radio
debates when he found out I was to be his opponent [1-4]. These
are not the actions of a man who is confident he has a real case.
<BR>
2. &quot;[Ross claims] Russ had acknowledged the existence of
these math errors.&quot; No, I haven't acknowledged any math errors.
I did acknowledge one minor verbal error --- a phrase in my book
--- which is irrelevant to my main argument. <BR>
3. &quot;[Ross claims] that when these errors are corrected they
prove an old universe rather than a young universe.&quot; Wrong
again. Shortly after publication of my book, Ross made this claim
in a newsletter to his supporters [5]. On March 7, 1995 I faxed
him a letter detailing the &quot;off-the-wall&quot; nature of
his criticisms and correcting them. He did not reply to me. On
March 26, I sent him a hard copy. He still did not reply. Finally
in May I published my letter openly [1]. He still did not reply
to me personally, but in August he finally responded publicly
[2]. In that letter to an editor, Ross did not defend his criticisms
specifically, but rather said that he had consigned that job to
several of his friends. Thus far, no criticisms from those friends
have appeared in any peer-reviewed scientific journal, creationist
or otherwise. (I'm hoping that will change.) Instead, Ross's friends
are relying on back-door circulation of letters and unreviewed
pamphlets. They are hiding from their supporters the existence
of a public exchange of articles between them and me in a non-peer-reviewed
layman's newsletter [6,7], particularly concealing the fact that
I replied. As far as I know, Ross himself has not personally committed
to print any technical criticisms about my book since August 1995.
<BR>
4. &quot;[Ross] elaborated further that he had discussed these
errors with Russ...&quot; That is not true at all. Ross has not
communicated with me since his last letter to me on April 15,
1993. In that letter he finally answered my persistent requests
that he be an official ICC reviewer for my forthcoming paper on
cosmology. He refused to commit himself to that job. Since 1993
he hasn't corresponded or spoken with me at all. So how can he
claim to have &quot;discussed&quot; the alleged errors in my 1994
book with me? If that is what Ross actually said, it is hard for
me to imagine it as anything but a direct, conscious lie.</P>

<P>I'm so used to half-truths (and worse) from Ross that they
don't surprise me any more. What surprises me is that there are
people on CRSnet who still unthinkingly tend to accept Ross's
statements as true. Surely everybody here should be able to see
through him by now! [D. Ihms note: we tend to believe someone
if they claim to be a Christian. When that person proves to be
unreliable, untruthful, hurtful, a slanderer, ... then we know
better.]</P>

<P>Bill seems worried that the enemies of young-earth creation
science may eventually find something wrong with my paper. Some
of my other creationist friends have the same worry. But what
would be so bad about that? Do I, like the Bible, have to be inspired
and inerrant? No. I'm proposing a scientific theory, not writing
new scripture! If any of you are placing your faith in any supposed
inerrancy of mine, you're in for a rude shock. I make mistakes!</P>

<P>Instead, place your faith in an inerrant Word of God. Read
it straightforwardly. Does it tell you that the world is young?
That is the message I get, loud and and clear. Well then, even
if my theory should turn out to be wrong, we know that a correct
young-world cosmology exists. Let's seek it vigorously ---- and
accept whatever mistakes we may make along the way with cheerfulness
and courage!</P>

<P>&quot;My choice of the word timeful to describe God's time-related
capacities deliberately contradicts a notion that much of the
church has held and taught for many centuries, the notion of a
'timeless' eternity as the realm where God lives and where we
will live someday also&quot; (Beyond the Cosmos p. 65)</P>

<P>Singling out Augustine and Aquinas as proponents of this doctrine,
Ross exclaims, &quot;... rare indeed is the student or professor
who dares to challenge the doctrine of God's dwelling in a timeless
eternity&quot; (ibid. p. 66), as Ross evidently means to do. In
his view, God &quot;must possess at least one more time dimension
(or some attribute, capacity, super-dimension or supra-dimension
that encompasses all the properties of time.... The Creator's
capacities include at least two, perhaps more, time dimensions&quot;
(ibid. pp. 23-24)</P>

<P>&quot;Ross thinks that by positing God's existence in higher
spatial dimensions, he can make sense of God's invisibility and
proximity.5 He claims that &quot;God is hidden from us in the
sense that we cannot make contact with Him through our five senses&quot;
(ibid. p. 72). But this is a clearly deficient conception of God's
spirituality and incorporeality, for it leaves open the view that
God is a spatial object which is simply undetectable by our senses'.
(Craig on Ross in Philosophia Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998)<BR>
God is Triune Has redefined the word &quot;Trinity&quot; to include
a modalistic version of the Godhead that is absurd (his words)
unless understood in light of his extra-dimensional theories of
God and heaven &quot;But as an illustration of the Trinity, Ross'
scenario of a three-dimensional hand intersecting a two-dimensional
surface seems no more adequate than the well-known, deficient
illustrations he criticizes. When flatlanders see the finger of
the hand intersecting their plane in different ways. &quot;They
might never discern that the six-plus manifestations were all
governed by one entity and one source of operation&quot; (Beyond
the Cosmos p. 93). But this amounts to an illustration of modalism,
not the Trinity. Later Ross imagines the flatlanders seeing the
several intersections of the hand's fingers with their plane,
commenting, &quot;The twoness, threeness, or moreness of our hand
(or one aspect of that plurality) they could imagine, but not
the oneness&quot; (ibid. p. 95). But the fingers are merely parts
of the one hand, and Ross himself earlier quoted from the Augsburg
Confession that &quot;... the term 'person' is used, as the ancient
Fathers employed it in this connection, to signify not a part
or a quality in another but that which subsists of itself.&quot;
The hand-flatland illustration thus only succeeds in illustrating
modalism or one thing's having three parts. It certainly does
not make the Trinity more intelligible.&quot; (emphasis added)

in the context of just the four dimensions&quot;. (Ross, Creator
&amp; Cosmos p. 147 &amp;148) (emphasis added)</P>

<P>&quot;And I would have to agree with the Muslim apologist who
says that the <B>Trinity is mathematical nonsense,</B> that it's
mathematically absurd. He's absolutely correct if God is confined
to the same dimensions that we are. It's utterly impossible for
the doctrine of the Trinity we see described in Scripture to be
possible, to be true, if there are only 4 dimensions for us and
for God. Can't happen. How could a being be simultaneously singular
and plural? It's much more complex than that as you'll see. But
it's utterly impossible in the 4 dimensions.&quot; (Ross, &quot;God
is One, Two, and Three, tape 1, side 1), (emphasis added).</P>

<P>&quot;The charge that 'Trinitarians' accept a mathematical
absurdity would seem appropriate ... if the biblical God were
confined to the same dimensional realm as humans&quot; (Beyond
the Cosmos p. 82).<BR>
Evil exists because men choose not to obey God. Evil is the absence
of or resistance to good That God is the author of evil. &quot;God's
in control of Satan. As such, it's proper to say that <B>God is
the author of all evil.</B> Yes, He created Satan for His own
purpose. God controls everything and predetermines everything
that Satan will do.&quot; &quot;(Ross, &quot;The Question of Evil
and Suffering,&quot; Nov. 30, 1989, RTB audio tape set no. A8915,

That man suffers under the curse as a result of his sin. That
the curse is a good thing and NOT the result of sin.<B> &quot;the
Curse is &quot;good,&quot;</B> a &quot;gift of God,&quot; and
&quot;It's not, you know, the wrath of God being poured out upon
us....The same thing's true with physical death&quot;; (Ross,

added)</P>

<P>Ross, &quot;Evidence of Design,&quot; Oct.26, 1989, tape 2</P>

<P><B>&quot;Physical death is a good thing</B> for the human race.
That's the first gift that God gave to the human race after we
died spiritually.... just because physical death takes place doesn't
mean it's bad. It's not bad from God's perspective; it is good;
it is a gift.&quot; (Ross, &quot;Question of Evil &amp; Suffering,&quot;
Nov. 30, 1989) (emphasis added)</P>

<P>&quot;Death is a gift for us from God. We need to see it as
a gift, not as something bad.&quot; (Ross, &quot;Science vs. Genesis,&quot;
Jan. 23, 1988 (CC-SA) tape 2, side 2. See also Ross, Fingerprint
(1989) pp. 154-155, 174 (1991 rev.) pp. 153-155, 174.</P>

<P>&quot;The Bible says the physical death we experience is a
gift, not a punishment.... Now, God's using death as a tool for
redemption.... If we try to gain God's perspective on the suffering
and death, just like eternal torment in hell, that doesn't seem
to jibe with God's love, yet the Bible declares that's an expression
of God's love. That should challenge us, as we study the Bible,
to dig deeper and see how love is revealed through physical death....&quot;

That one of the immutable attributes of God is Omniscience. That
God is not Omniscient in the traditional sense but rather is the
equivalent of a telephone operator existing in many dimensions
with and infinite number of connections available to those of
us in finite time. In one place Dr. Ross suggests that the postulation
of a hypertime helps to answer a third-grader's question about
how God can listen to a billion prayers at once. Not only does
Ross seem to get his answer backwards (he, in effect, turns our
time into a hypertime above time instead of saying God has infinitely
many hyper-instants at which to listen to each prayer in succession),
but his answer dreadfully depreciates divine omniscience. Rather
than cast God anthropomorphically as a cognitively limited, hyper-dimensional
telephone operator, Ross should have explained to his third-grade
friend that just as a super-computer can do millions of operations
at once, God is infinitely more intelligent than a super-computer
and so His lines can never get jammed! (Craig on Ross in Philosophia
Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998)<BR>
That the incarnate Christ was at all times fully God and fully
man. That Christ in the incarnation was not two natures in one
being but rather stopped being fully God at the incarnation. &quot;Ross
also believes that God's extra-dimensionality serves to illumine
Christology. Unfortunately, although Ross clearly affirms that
Jesus is both God and man, it may be justifiably doubted whether
he affirms the Chalcedonian formula of two natures united in one
person. For example, he does not describe the incarnation as the
second person of the Trinity's taking on a human nature in addition
to his divine nature, but as God's literally turning Himself into
a human being:</P>

<P><I>... the second person of the Triune God, the Creator of
all angels and of the entire universe, actually became a man....
God supernaturally entered the womb of a virgin (Mary). How He
interacted with or modified Mary's egg is not made clear in Scripture,
but He became a flesh and blood embryo</I> (Beyond the Cosmos
p. 104).</P>

<P>This remarkable statement suggests that Ross stands in the
Alexandrian tradition of one-nature Christology. Such a conception
seems to require God's relinquishing some of His divine attributes
in becoming a man, and this is just what Ross affirms:</P>

<P><I>In coming to Earth as an embryo in the virgin's womb, Christ
'emptied' Himself, leaving behind the extra-dimensional realm
and capacities He shared with God the Father and God the Holy
Spirit. When He had completed the work He set out to do, the work
of redemption, He returned to the place and the powers He had
left behind</I> (Beyond the Cosmos p. 49).</P>

<P><B>This passage constitutes an endorsement of kenotic theology,</B>
which interprets Christ's self-emptying as the divestiture of
certain divine attributes. <B>Now this sort of non-Chalcedonian,
kenotic Christology seems to me a very serious aberration&quot;</B>
(Craig on Ross in Philosophia Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998)
(emphasis added)<BR>
That God can not die. That the portion of God's nature that was
retained by Christ actually died on the cross &quot;Some skeptics
and atheists have argued that if Jesus were God, He could not
have died; and if He died, He could not have been God. They recognize,
of course, the contradiction in saying that Jesus is both really
dead and really alive.... The simultaneity of Jesus' death and
immortality would only be a contradiction, however, if the time,
place, and context of His death were identical to the time, place
and dimensional context of His being alive.... Because of Christ's
identity as God and His access to all the dimensions or superdimensions
God encompasses, He could experience suffering and death in all
the human-occupied dimensions and then transition into any of
His other dimensions or realms once the atonement price had been
paid&quot; (Ross, Beyond the Cosmos pp. 108-109)</P>

<P>&quot;Here Ross does seem to affirm that God was both dead
and alive, but that that contradiction is avoided by extra-dimensionality.
But this escape does not seem to work. For Ross had clearly affirmed
that in the incarnation God the Son had left the extra-dimensional
realms and capacities he shared with the Father and the Spirit.
Thus, if he died in our human realm, God died. How he could then
transition back to extra-dimensional realms once he had died seems
inexplicable. In any case the logical problem here is not just
God's being both dead and alive, but God's being dead, period.
By definition, God cannot perish. But without a two natures Christology,
we are forced to affirm the absurdity that God died&quot;. (Craig
on Ross in Philosophia Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998) (emphasis
added)<BR>
That Christ died once and his atonement for our sins was completed
on the cross. That Christ is eternally separated from God dying
and infinite number of deaths on an infinite number of time lines
for an infinite amount of time. &quot;Extra-dimensionality leads
Ross into even more bizarre speculations about the atonement in
answer to the question of how one man's death could pay for all
people's sins. Instead answering that question in terms of the
dignity of Christ's person, he hypothesizes that perpendicular
to our time dimension is another dimension composed of billions
of separate time lines on each of which <B>Christ suffers death
and subsequent isolation from God for infinite time</B> (Beyond
the Cosmos p. 112). I find this speculation profoundly unacceptable.
It requires, in effect, <B>billions of Christs,</B> thus destroying
Christ's personal identity. For it is a distinct person who dies
on the cross in each of these time lines. Moreover, each of these
&quot;Christs&quot; suffers separation from God endlessly with
no hope of resurrection and victory at the end. That Christ rises
in our temporal dimension is the exception to the rule; <B>the
other Christs remain separated from God forever, which makes a
mockery of Jesus' triumph over death.&quot;</B>: (Craig on Ross
in Philosophia Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998) (emphasis added)<BR>
Jesus rose in the body he was sown in made incorruptible. Jesus
physical appearances are explained by the illusion created by
manipulating the physical dimensions.<I> &quot;Ross also makes
a curious suggestion concerning Jesus' resurrection appearances:
in disappearing from view, Jesus &quot;rotated&quot; each of his
three spatial dimensions into a fourth, fifth, and sixth spatial
dimension respectively</I> (Beyond The Cosmos pp. 46-47). <B>Jesus'
resurrection body thus literally came apart and became three one-dimensional
lines--not a very robust conception of a body!&quot;</B> (Craig
on Ross in Philosophia Christi Volume 21:1 - Summer, 1998) (emphasis
added)<BR>
We are saved by faith alone through grace alone. Betrays the Reformation
doctrine of sola fide, in favor of a non-Christian gradually increasing
in &quot;Christlikeness&quot; until he irrevocably crosses the
&quot;salvation threshold &quot;With respect to doctrine of salvation,
Ross' diagrams on pp. 161, 162 seem to <B>betray the Reformation
doctrine of sola fide,</B> for they show a non-Christian gradually
increasing in &quot;Christlikeness&quot; until he irrevocably
crosses the &quot;salvation threshold.&quot; Even if we interpret
this increase to be the result of God's prevenient work, it is
still surely false that salvation is achieved by a non-Christian's
growing more Christlike until he crosses the line of no return
and is saved.&quot; (Craig on Ross in Philosophia Christi Volume

<P><B>Important Comments on the Ministry of Hugh Ross Ph. D.</B>
<BR>
by Robert A. Herrmann Ph. D. <BR>
2 April 1999, Revised 9 JULY 2000</P>

<P>After conducting personal research on the subject, I have the
following conclusions relative to the scientific background and
teachings of Hugh Norman Ross, Ph. D, the President of Reasons
to Believe, Inc. I do not intend, in any manner, to present any
personal attack upon Hugh Ross as an individual. My only concern
is with the doctrine presented by this organization. All of the
relative material used in this research is published and publicly
available. I will state my conclusion first and then give some
justifications. [It is very important, however, that if you consider
these findings significant that you continue your own research
and actually determine the correctness of my conclusions for yourself.]</P>

<P>Although there should be no need whatsoever to remind any reader
of this page who created the universe in which we dwell, it does
serve a very definite need in what follows.</P>

<P>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God . . . All things are made by him; and without
him was not any thing made that was made. . . . And the Word was
made flesh and dwelt among us. . . (John 1: 1 - 14) Who is the
image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For
by him were all things created, that are on heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible, . . . . (Colossians 1: 15 - 16)</P>

<P>Also of considerable significance is the statement found in
Hebrews 1:3 where we are told that continually this same &quot;image
of the invisible God&quot; is</P>

<P>sustaining [or upholding] the universe by His powerful command.</P>

<P>Indeed, it is Jesus Himself who gave warnings by partially
describing &quot;false prophets&quot; as they will appear throughout
the times of the New Testament church.</P>

<P>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. (Matthew 7:15)</P>

<P>It is not difficult to find other Scriptural characteristics
for false prophets or false apostles. In 2 Timothy 3, Paul describes
the condition of society that will mark the &quot;last days.&quot;
The description is exactly that of our present times. Described
in 2 Timothy 3:5 are those</P>

<P>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
from such turn away.</P>

<P>Paul also gives direct characteristics that will aid in identifying
false prophets or false apostles.</P>

<P>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth
another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another
spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye
have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. . . . For such
are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves
into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself
is transformed into an angel of light. (II Corinthians 11: 3-14)</P>

<P>The teachings of this ministry exemplify, as described above,
the teachings of false prophets or false apostles.</P>

<P>[1] Relative to scientific matters, when compared with other
scientists who have contributed significantly to the relation
between science and theology (for example see temp) , the secular
scientific achievements of Hugh Ross can only be considered as
minimal in character. With only 5 published articles in established
secular scientific journals, the last being in December 1977,
it is clear, to me, that Ross and his associates could not possibly
be aware of the somewhat complex modern (1985 - present) scientific
techniques used to analyze such speculative theories as the standard
model for the evolution of our universe or to analyze specific
theological doctrine. Because of these facts, one should investigate
very, very carefully any scientific pronouncements or claims made
by members of his organization, and definitely not accept them
based simply upon a claimed, but not substantiated, scientific
authority. [Note: The author of this commentary is a member of
a group of scientists who present models that uphold recent creation.
This &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; ministry tends to denigrate
the scientific background and achievements of members of this
group. If you have not done so, you may wish to compare this author's
&quot;1. Professional Biography&quot; and &quot;10. Published
Papers&quot; with those of Hugh Ross. This will help you to determine
the truthfulness of any such assertion.]</P>

<P>[2] Within the writings of this organization, statements have
been made that are not historical fact, and in the tried and true
fashion of false apostles, this ministry mixes fact with fiction.
This is especially so when there are published or recorded claims
that certain statements or concepts appear in the Bible when in
reality the Bible is either silent on the matter or the Bible
states otherwise. (Relative to this, please see Dr. Hugh Ross
Exposed.)</P>

<P>[3] <B>Re-interpretations</B> of many literal Bible statements
and non-biblical additions to the attributes of God as practiced
by this ministry are the exact methods that have been and will
continue to be used by all false prophets and false apostles.
Proudly, they all claim or will claim that they have a form of
special interpretation or revelation. For example, as used in
Genesis 1, there is the significant word hayah. This word has
a wide semantic range. In the Scriptures, its meaning for thousands
of years as been &quot;to exist&quot; &quot;to come into being,&quot;
&quot;cause to be made or done.&quot; But we are told by this
ministry that in Genesis 1 there is one place and just one place
where its meaning has been universally misunderstood. The special
revelation accorded this ministry, and no one else, is that in
Genesis 1:14 the word must be translated as &quot;to appear,&quot;
meaning to simply become visible to an observer. &quot;Let there
appear lights in the firmament&quot; rather than the accepted
and consistent creation command &quot;Let there be (come into
existence) lights in the firmament.&quot;</P>

<P>Relative to the Bible and the New Testament church, a certain
basic method has been used since 130 AD. The method used is as
follows: Literal Bible terms are re-interpreted in terms of the
language and comprehension of a particular social or political
unit or the like. The same language is used for the many claimed
additions or alterations to the Divine attributes. Then certain
claims are made that with respect to the notions associated with
a such a group of individuals the Bible confirms basic hypotheses
accepted or, at the least, comprehended by the group. For an example
of a clever and extreme case, please consider Alice Bailey's book,
&quot;From Bethlehem to Calvary, The Initiations of Jesus&quot;
(Lucis, New York, 1937). She claims to use the Scriptures and
to establish that Jesus actually went through the occult initiation
processes and became one of the adapts called &quot;Masters.&quot;</P>

<P>[4] &quot;General revelation&quot; - the claim that by observing
nature one can determine that a &quot;supernatural&quot; god or
even gods with certain attributes exist has been utilized for
many thousands of years. Such displayed attributes most be limited
in character, however. Of course, one is almost always lead to
these attributes by the claims of others rather than direct personal
investigation. Humankind worships a god or gods with the hypothesized
attributes. Clearly, if no god actually exists with such attributes,
then such worship would be akin to idolatry from a Christian perspective.
As shown in [6], this ministry's specific statement that general
revelation will lead to salvation is untrue and exceptionally
dangerous. Only through the very special and literal revelations
stated in the Scriptures can an individual who claims to be a
Christian attain salvation.</P>

<P>[5] This ministry uses these linguistic &quot;Bible altering&quot;
techniques and presents arguments in terms of the prevailing &quot;science
or science fiction&quot; orientation of many members of our present
&quot;Star Trek&quot; generation. This ministry makes absurd statements
that non-verifiable speculative science is fact. This ministry
actually rejects almost all of the creationary statements made
throughout the Bible and, yet, claims that they are establishing
the Bible creation scenario. They have added enormously to the
Bible via pure speculation, such as claiming that &quot;God has
increased the complexity of life on earth by successive creations
over billions of years while miraculously changing the earth to
accommodate new life&quot; (emphasis added), and claim that such
Biblical speculation is fact. [Later, I'll direct you to scientific
models for Biblical creation that require no such level of speculation
and satisfy the Bible's statements exactly.] It is enough to say
that on this very Web site is a mathematical model that shows
that such speculative theories as used by this ministry have no
actual scientific merit since there are infinitely many of them
that can be used to verify all possible observations. Relative
to Scriptural interpretations, the claim that others may have
had, but probably did not have, such &quot;revelations&quot; does
not alter the statement that special extra-biblical knowledge is
required for such re-interpretations, knowledge that does not
illuminate doctrine, but rather completely alters the original
doctrine presented to the church during the first century. It
is not the purpose of this comment to discuss such a reliance
upon speculation since from my experience such a re-interpretation
in terms of modern scientific terms is most likely to be but a
popular overt procedure that is actually hiding a very dangerous
covert response - a response that may not be fully appreciated
by the &quot;Reasons to Believe&quot; ministry.</P>

<P>[6] This ministry's stated views on physical death, sin and
especially salvation are extremely dangerous and demonstrate clearly
that this doctrine is that of false prophets or false apostles
as described above. To state that &quot;The plan of salvation
as stated in the Bible can be seen through observation of the
universe about us,&quot; that Nature is like the &quot;sixty-seventh
book&quot; of the Bible, and to claim that human beings fallible
observation of natural-system behavior should be &quot;on equal
footing&quot; with the written infallible revelations of the Scriptures
is blasphemy since these statements are totally false.</P>

<P>The Hebrew verb &quot;to die&quot; (muwth) appears approximately
800 times in the Old Testament. Of major significance is its appearance
in Genesis 2:17, and 3:3, 4. This ministry claims that for these
three occurrences only &quot;spiritual&quot; death is the correct
interpretation. However, in all other cases within the Old Testament
the term refers directly to &quot;physical&quot; death. There
can be no doubt that this claimed private interpretation is incorrect
and that physical death must also be indicated by these three
verses. Further, &quot;spiritual death&quot; is indicated not
by the use of such a term but rather by the &quot;covering&quot;
concept. This egregious error invalidates this ministry's doctrine.</P>

<P>The &quot;death and resurrection&quot; aspect of the Gospel
message as preached by Paul is explicitly stated in 1 Corinthians
15. Relative to death, this chapter is totally concerned with
physical death. Consequently, Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians
15:21-23, at the least, refers to physical death. Paul states
even more explicitly the relationship between this type of &quot;physical
death&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot; He writes, &quot;On this account,
as by one man sin into the world entered, and by sin death, and
thus to all men death passed. . . &quot; Romans 5:12 (Thomas Newberry,
The Englishman's Greek New Testament) This ministry denies the
clear logical implication that &quot;physical death&quot; came
to the &quot;world&quot; through Adam's sin and from this general
physical death, specific physical death was passed onto humankind.
This statement should be easily understood without any further
explanation or commentary, this meaning of the word &quot;death&quot;
most certainly includes physical death. [Note: I do not deny the
fact that the word Paul uses here and translated &quot;world,&quot;
the Greek word kosmos, has various contextual meanings such as
system, earth, humankind, etc. There are other proof-texts such
as Romans 8: 20-23, among others, that indicate Paul's understanding
that the term, in this case, should, at the least, include the
entire earth.]</P>

<P>This ministry's stated doctrine most definitely will lead to
a strong deception and will, indeed, &quot;deceive&quot; even
some who consider themselves members of the &quot;elect,&quot;
the chosen. This organization's statements relative to the doctrine
of salvation through observing nature (i.e. naturalism) strongly
undermines, especially for a &quot;scientifically&quot; oriented
society, the fact that, with the coming of the New Testament church,
salvation is through belief in and the acceptance of the Gospel
message, including all of its supernatural aspects, and a personal
Savior, Jesus Christ. Such salvation can only be obtained through
Jesus Christ and, once an individual is exposed to these Biblical
truths, only through the special procedures explicitly stated
only within the Bible. These special Biblical revelations cannot
come from general revelation.</P>

<P>This ministry also presents some very unusual statements that
do not directly occur in the Scriptures and yet they claim that
they do. These statements deal with the great philosophical problems
of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil.&quot; Rather than acknowledging
the clear Scriptural teachings that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;
are spirits, this ministry presents philosophical ramblings such
as &quot;physical death is good&quot; and even a &quot;gift from
God,&quot; an &quot;expression of His love.&quot; Further, this
ministry may claim that physical death is &quot;not a punishment&quot;
nor even a &quot;wrath of God.&quot; As direct statements, these
quotations appear to be in direct opposition to the salvation
message and Paul's statements in 1 Corinthians 15:26 and 54 -
56. Note in particular 56: &quot;The sting of death is sin&quot;
(KJ) &quot;For sin - the sting the causes death - will all be
gone.&quot; (LB) It is well-known that many believe that the Hebrew
mind-set was that God was the creator not just of the material
universe but also responsible for everything including good and
evil. That evil was &quot; . . . looked on as God's punishment
which normally corresponds exactly to the preceding sin.&quot;
But the facts appear to be that one can ask many questions about
the Old Testament concept of evil, which the Old Testament does
not answer in any clear and direct manner. The answers are more
directly obtained from the New Testament. If God allows obtuse
dialectic arguments as a bases for comprehending His basic concepts,
then there are arguments that seem to circumvent the apparent
prohibitions presented within Paul's statement or, indeed, as
such statements might be understood relative to the more definitive
New Testament meanings for these concepts. The logic needed is
not scientific logic and does undermine the scientific logic used
for a scientific creation scenario. Such statements would, in
my opinion, most certainly not help the &quot;heathen&quot; to
accept the clear and straightforward New Testament salvation format.
The concepts of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; as presented
by this ministry will actual aid to defeat the salvation message
and are clearly designed to confuse and beguile. From my 42 years
attuned to the mind of evil, the absolute fact is that an individual
must first realize the need for a Savior, a need to be attuned
to the &quot;mind of Christ,&quot; to a Spirit, rather than to
be attuned to another spirit, the mind of evil.</P>

<P>The most dangerous aspect of this theology is that removing,
from the Bible, the basic literal meanings for many significant
terms or claiming, without any direct Biblical justification,
that pure speculative statements are Biblically inspired will
allow individuals exposed to these linguistic methods to also
remove, &quot;cross out,&quot; alter or add to the literal and
required Biblically stated &quot;salvation format.&quot; As it
has been established above and by other investigators, this theology
is, indeed, &quot;another gospel&quot; implied nowhere within
Paul's writings and, indeed, nowhere within the Scriptures. Dr.
Bolton Davidheiser at the above Internet site &quot;Dr. Hugh Ross
Exposed&quot; comments as follows:</P>

<P>But freedom from idolatry through recognizing that there must
be a God of creation is a different matter from understanding
salvation by grace and receiving Christ as personal Savior through
accepting His atonement for sin. . . . We know that there are
heathen that have not heard the gospel of salvation through the
atonement made by the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross at Calvary
and we know that there are those in our country at this present
time who have not heard, even among many who go to church regularly.
God is the righteous Judge. It is not for us to judge but to minister
the gospel wherever we can.</P>

<P>(For a further discussion as to this ministry's attempts at
Scriptural re-interpretation, a process that leads to the actual
salvation aspect of this ministry, the &quot;Universal God&quot;
concept of general revelation, please see the 1994 book, &quot;Creation
and Time: A Report on the Book by Hugh Ross,&quot; by Van Bebber
and Taylor. It is published by Eden Communications and you can
find this book listed under their Christian Superstore at this
URL.)</P>

<P>This ministry does not uphold the incomprehensible and supernatural
Divine <B>power</B> of God's creationary processes and, hence,
greatly weakens the salvation message, its supernatural aspects
and its strict Biblical format. Many individuals will probably
follow this ministry's salvation message. A few will seek proper
guidance from the special revelations given only in the Bible
as to the proper and literal salvation format. But, many, many
more will not follow this guidance although they have been exposed
to the correct Scriptural statements. Jesus has described the
probable salvation result for this latter group.</P>

<P>Many will say to me in that day Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them,
I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. (Matthew
7:22)</P>

<P>[7] Such doctrinal concerns appear not to be relative to the
salvation of the so-called heathen who have not or will not receive
the correct salvation message. For, if this ministry's concerns
were of this nature, then it would follow the absolute Scriptural
requirements of the &quot;Great Commission&quot; as they are explicitly
described by the God this ministry claims to follow. I repeat,
that it is clear to me that this doctrinal approach, this dangerous
theology, as it is being presented to many &quot;science or science
fiction&quot; oriented individuals who might be considered as
Scripturally weak in doctrine will drive a wedge between such
individuals and the true path to salvation. As indicate in [6],
the Scriptures indicate, in my opinion, that such a process could
easily lead to individual damnation, which is one of the most
basic goals of the Adversary.</P>

<P>[8] One aspect of this ministry is deceptive scientifically
since there is a prior claim. For years, this ministry has attempted
to model Divine attributes by applying what is claimed is some
form of standard &quot;dimension&quot; theory. However, I know
of no, and I repeat no, scientific definition for this concept
that has any relation to the attributes this ministry attempts
to model. Indeed, not even &quot;infinite dimension&quot; theory
is satisfactory. Unless this ministry gives an acceptable definition
for the concept they apply, then their model is vacuous. It is
extremely clear that within the Scriptures the supernatural attributes
of the Godhead are, at the most, but partially comprehensible
when they are compared to natural attributes. But, for each of
these numerous comparisons it is stated specifically that the
supernatural attributes are very dissimilar from natural attributes
in power and divinity. Since standard mathematical structures,
including finite and infinite dimensional structures, are used
to model natural-system behavior within our universe and the natural
attributes of God's created, using these same structures to model
God's supernatural aspects is closely related to pantheism. <B>Any
claim this ministry makes that the standard mathematical structure
they use models aspects of the supernatural attributes of God
is completely false and designed to take glory unto themselves
and will lead many individuals towards everlasting damnation.</B>
Another reason for this warning is that as Ross' &quot;God&quot;
concept evolves it is converging towards a type of &quot;Cosmic
Logos&quot; of the Alice Bailey occultism.</P>

<P>It is significant to the claims of this ministry that the first
non-pantheistic mathematical model ever devised that does, indeed,
model the attributes this ministry attempts to, but fails to so
model, does so by modeling processes that mirror concepts stated
specifically within the Scriptures. The model was constructed
from 1979 - 1982 (Herrmann, R. A. &quot;The reasonableness of
metaphysical evidence,&quot; Journal of the American Scientific
Affiliation, 34(1)(1982), 12-23), appears to pre-date any comparable
work by Hugh Ross, and it is very, very strange that this ministry
is apparently not aware of this model's existence when one considers
this ministry's association with the American Scientific Affiliation.</P>

<P>[9] Relative to other less significant concerns, members of
his ministry, apparently, have no comprehension of the modern
notion of &quot;abrupt appearance&quot; in mature and structured
form. This is clear from statements made where this concept is
discussed only relative to nineteenth century writer Grosse. The
modern concept is completely distinct from the Grosse theory.</P>

<P>[10] Finally, I cannot find a compelling statement from his
ministry that affirms that only through true supernatural Holy
Spirit verification, as required by 1 John 2:27, and not by scientific
means can the correctness of any such theological doctrine be
determined.</P>

<P>[For a brief discussion of the theology of the Hugh Ross ministry,
please consider the following Web site.]</P>

<P><B>Significant Additional Information</B></P>

<P>Due to their concentration upon purely unguided naturalistic
processes, the ministry discussed above actually denies the true
creation power of God. Scriptural statements such as the above
quoted Hebrews 1:3 indicate such a power, a power that does not
exist within the naturalistic mechanisms advocated by this organization,
a power that cannot be modeled by means of any standard mathematical
theory that is claimed to correspond in any manner to the Scriptures.
One could characterize such a power in an easily understood manner
by stating that if God simply stopped &quot;thinking about&quot;
His creation, so to speak, then His creation would cease to exist.
Is there an actual scientific model that <B>predicts,</B> not
just assumes or hypothesizes, the rational existence of just such
a power?</P>

<P>The mathematical theory that yields the scientific model that
solves the General Grand Unification Problem can be directly interpreted
using the theological language that appears in Genesis 1. The
interpretation is exact and absolutely literal. No alterations
in the meanings of the fundamental terms in Genesis 1 occurs and
no additional assumptions are included. Further, this same scientific
structure models exactly the sustaining power described in Hebrews
1:3. Since the modeling processes use the most consistent modern
mathematical procedures that were discovered but a few years ago,
rather than the inconsistent mathematical interpretation procedures
used to construct the model advocated by this ministry, you should
expect, unless you are well prepared in the appropriate technical
requirements, that the actual correspondence to Genesis 1 might
be somewhat difficult to comprehend in any depth.</P>

<P>Actual scientifically generated models that do so correspond
to Genesis 1 can be found described within the article The U-cosmology.
Further, when this U-cosmology is coupled with the Microeffects
- Genesis Flood model, then the combination of effects completely
and literally corresponds to the Biblical account. Indeed, it
appears that these combined models will satisfy <B>all</B> of
the observational data as well as or better than the model advocated
by this ministry. This combination is a model that presents a
counter to the model proposed by this ministry and demonstrates
that the &quot;correct&quot; model cannot be known by scientific
means. Indeed, the same modeling procedures can be used to model
numerously many other possible creation scenarios that will diverge
completely from these literal scenarios. <B>From a scientific
viewpoint, to imply that the model presented by this ministry
has been established as the correct model is the greatest deception
of all.</B> You must use &quot;other&quot; means, and definitely
not the &quot;scientific method,&quot; to make a choice. But,
of course, the choice might depend upon whether you consider the
Bible as the inerrant word of God, a document that should not
be altered in any manner whatsoever. However, most certainly,
the choice is entirely at your discretion. [Note: With respect
to the U-cosmology, I challenge anyone within this ministry to
show that it is not obtained by means of a correct scientific
modeling procedure, that it does not follow the exact and literally
stated Biblical format, or that it uses any form of significant
Biblical speculation.]</P>

<P>It is my firm belief that this ministry, and many others, misinterpret,
purposely I think, Romans 1: 19-20. There are various interpretations
of these verses that often seem to depend upon the prideful nature
of a ministry. The proudful interpretations always relate to the
ability of the human being to describe the actual processes God
has used to create. The Hugh Ross ministry often justifies its
efforts based upon such a proudful interpretation. But, the MA-model,
absolutely substantiates that such interpretations are not Biblical.
Below is presented a very brief portion from the above mentioned
U-cosmology article that discusses these proudful interpretations.
The MA-model shows that the &quot;heathen's&quot; knowledge of
God need not come from a detailed, yet fallible, human explanation
as to how God created but, rather, from an appreciation for God's
immense creative power, and, possibly, the simple knowledge that
the universe exhibits a kind of beauty or design that can only
be attributed to a higher intelligence.</P>

<P>Hundreds of times within the Scriptures, we are told how different
God is from His created. How &quot;incomprehensible&quot; are
His ways, and the like. The problem is that we are also told that
we can &quot;reason together&quot; with God. One certainly needs
to have some idea as to what God's created life forms can or cannot
comprehend about God's creative and sustaining processes. The
major verses that are claimed to uphold humankind's ability to
have vast knowledge relative to the behavior and formation of
the universe exterior to the solar system are Psalm 19:1 as it
is coupled with Romans 1:19-20. I suggest it should rather be
coupled with Romans 1:19-23. The form of the Greek word here and
often translated as &quot;made&quot; and which appears only twice
in this form, seems to be much broader in its sense and might
be better translated as &quot;achievements&quot; not just those
exhibited by His material creation.</P>

<P>What these verses appear to be discussing are God's &quot;attributes.&quot;
In particular, His achievements &quot;clearly&quot; indicate His
unseen, by human senses, &quot;eternal&quot; power and Divinity.
I am not the only individual that claims this interpretation.
Luther writes relative to Romans 1:20, &quot; 'are clearly seen,'
perceived not by the senses but by understanding His 'eternal
power and Divinity'.&quot; Indeed, the Greek elemental meaning
of the word translated as &quot;eternal&quot; is &quot;un-perceived,&quot;
where &quot;perceived&quot; means, in general, to gain knowledge
by the senses. . . . Further, I doubt that in the first century
one would conclude from the more complete Romans 1:19-23 that
Paul intended one to believe that humankind could also comprehend
in any great detail the actual processes God used to create. Much
more likely, Paul means that humankind has an understanding of
these Divine attributes from what is observed because such observations
exhibit the power and Divinity of God; a power and Divinity that
can be but partially comprehended and, most certainly, can not
be replicated by His created. These verses are directed to individuals
who do not acknowledge the highly incomprehensible aspects of
God as represented by His wondrous creative power. They thus glorify
Him not, but became vain through the use of human imaginations
as a replacement for God's creative power, a creative power that
is claimed by corruptible individuals to be humanly comprehensible.</P>

<P>In numerously many ways, the MA-model upholds this impossibility
of human comprehension. . . . Although but a slight comparison,
individuals often seem to appreciate artistic endeavors to a much
greater degree, than would ordinarily be expected, if they don't
understand exactly how the end results are achieved.</P>

<P><B>A CRITIQUE</B></P>

<P>Dear Hugh,</P>

<P>During the past month I have been reviewing all your tapes,
printed essays, and booklets. It is been a valuable and edifying
process for me. Your scientific knowledge is impeccable---I feel
like I have taken a refresher course in astronomy and physics.
I have truly been refreshed and stimulated in my thinking as a
result of going through all your material. You have provoked me
to look at science and the Bible afresh and to spend more time
on my own Christian world view concerning creation. Since you
have sharpened my view of Genesis through your effective lectures
and keen insight, I am writing in hopes I can sharpen your views
in return, &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.&quot;
I am not exactly a Bible-and-science concordist as you are, but
I am eager to support your ministry and to see your life have
even deeper and continued impact on our present-day pagan culture.
I agree that our observations of nature and our scientific models
if they are correct must be in accord with the Bible. Our Christian
faith is grounded in history and a detailed revelation from God
who tells us a great deal about many subjects. I support your
position against the irrationalists of our day who would throw
out everything science has to say about creation. Your insights
and experience have strengthened my own view of the creation which
is different in some respects from yours. When I was a new Christian
I held a world view more similar to yours based more strongly
on modern astronomy and physics, but as I have come to know the
Bible better I have moved gradually away from a belief that modern
science was all that insightful. Please accept my comments and
critique as encouragements and challenges, not as a fault-finding
attack on your ministry or your personal beliefs. I took notes
and wrote out comments as I listened to your tapes and these are
not in any special order in what follows.</P>

<P><B>Astronomy and Biology:</B> Your treatment of the consequences
of a finite universe (as seen by the astronomer) as it relates
to the impossibility of evolution is outstanding and needs to
be given a much wider hearing in my opinion. Your personal testimony
is thrilling to me and I rejoice at God's calling for your life.</P>

<P><B>Biblical Truth and Scientific Truth:</B> Science gives us
limited models and theories based on observables from the physical
universe. These models are based on the uniformity of natural
laws. They are also extrapolations based on available evidence.
Scientific truth is relative and limited, Biblical truth is absolute
and eternal. In presenting truth to non-scientific audiences I
believe it is important to show that scientific theories are not
absolute, and scientific truth is in a different category than
Biblical truth. We should always qualify our remarks by saying
something like: &quot;According to the best and most careful scientific
data (which I subscribe to), such and such appears to be true.&quot;
Or, &quot;The Bible says thus and so, but that leaves room for
us to hold to several different possible views based on scientific
evidence. I personally hold to the hypothesis that...&quot; Without
these kinds of qualifying remarks the lay person can get the idea
that science is absolutely certain of what it talks about. The
untrained listener has no way of knowing the underlying assumptions
of a scientific theory, the presuppositions of the scientist,
the history of science, alternate explanations and the often arbitrary
ways science moves ahead by trial and error. Physics is fortunate
to have had a number of Christians in its ranks, especially in
the past but we need to make clear that sinful, fallen man can
not hope to figure things out correctly if he ignores revelation.
In your taped talks I get the impression that you hold scientific
truth to be on equal footing with the Bible. I am sure this is
not what you really believe but I am concerned that you could
be misunderstood. Modern day rationalism starts with man, not
God, and attempts to build a whole view of the universe that fits
together into a cohesive whole without God being needed or necessary
anywhere.</P>

<P><B>The History of Science</B> is revealing as to man's being
deceived in the past. We must guard against the possibility that
modern science could also be deceived. Living in an age of advanced
systems of knowledge is not necessarily the same as being closer
to the truth or to Biblical wisdom. There is an increase in knowledge
in our age, but regarding a clear perception of reality I Cor.
1 says &quot;none of the rulers of this age knew it, otherwise
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.&quot; Ian Taylor
(In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order) has helped
me to appreciate that much of modern science was founded by men
who wanted an alternate way of viewing the universe that denied
Biblical creation. All science is built on an underlying philosophy.
All scientific theories begin with assumptions and limitations.
Usually we oversimplify things beyond what they really are to
make the amount of work we have to do reasonable. Today's science
is mostly naturalistic and far removed from a Biblical point of
view.</P>

<P><B>Francis Schaeffer and &quot;modern, modern science:</B>
A major change in western society has occurred in the past half
century especially. Earlier, men believed in a spiritual world
and the existence of a supreme being (there was a general consensus),
though not many were necessarily Christians. Biblical assumptions
about reality prevailed in all aspects of culture. (Western science
could only come into existence in a society with underlying Biblical
presuppositions---as you note). Belief in the existence of God
and even of the spiritual world itself have eroded away gradually
until modern man has reached a point of existential despair. Truth
is seen as entirely relative. Secular humanism and naturalism
prevail. Only the material aspects of creation are seen as real,
the realm of the spiritual has turned into a vacuum. We must be
very careful because modern science operates with the &quot;upper
storey&quot; empty, whereas in the Bible the upper storey is the
real, enduring, and permanent. The notion of human &quot;progress&quot;
or social evolution is an illusion. Solomon says there is nothing
new under the sun, so we must not suppose that we really know
more about the universe than the ancients. Man is open to deception.
Satan is always working to conceal truth that reflects to the
glory of God or the liberation of man. &quot;The whole world lies
in the lap of the evil one.&quot; Any new truth from science which
reflects on a truly biblical position will be vigorously resisted
by the powers of evil and darkness. When man ignores God, God
gives us up to believe the lie. Evolutionary theory a good example.
Failure to accept light, understanding, wisdom and insight from
God causes God to give man over the believe something false: &quot;The
coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with
all power and with pretended signs and wonders, and with all wicked
deception for those who are to perish, because they refused to
love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends upon them
a strong delusion, to make them believe what is false, (lit: &quot;the
lie&quot;) so that all may be condemned who did not believe the
truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&quot; (2 Thessalonians
2:10-13) The nature of &quot;the lie&quot; is described for us
in Romans 1 and consists in the delusion that man is master of
his own fate, captain of his own soul, and capable of being his
own God. In First Corinthians 1 and 2 Paul addresses the unbelief
which especially characterizes the intellectual and scientific
leaders in any age. He notes that whole systems of human thought
can be wrong and that &quot;God chose what is foolish in the world
to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame
the strong, and chose what is low and despised in the world, even
things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that
no human being might boast in the presence of God&quot;.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Dual Revelation: Science and the Bible&quot;:</B>
You claim a dual revelation from God is available to us, in science
and in the Bible. I believe such a claim needs careful qualification.
Finding beauty, harmony, design and patterns in nature is not
the same thing as finding beauty in a scientific theory or model.
God does not deceive by falsifying nature, but scientists are
easily deceived in the ways they interpret nature. &quot;The Gospel
According to Science&quot;. To my way of thinking this statement
of yours on one of your tapes could be very misleading. I suggest
you consult some Bible scholars or read further on the subjects
of Special vs. General Revelation. Science is a human endeavor,
part of the world system which is under the dominion of Satan---the
god of this world. Science is based on the efforts of fallible
human beings who are easily deceived. It is quite one thing to
collect data---facts and measurements about the world---and quite
another matter to fit these observations into coherent theories.
Nature gives some evidence but only shadows that point to the
existence of God. It is going much too far to say that nature
&quot;contains the full gospel&quot; as you suggest in one of
your tapes. Nature reveals that there is a Creator, a Designer,
an awesome Intelligence behind things. Nature however does not
tell us abut redemption, the incarnation, eschatology, or the
nature of evil. Romans 2 merely says that if a man follows what
little moral light he has and responds to it, God will give him
more light until he is saved. There is one way to God, but there
are many ways to Christ. But, no one seeks for God, and God must
come and rescue the elect, otherwise they would never turn to
seek Him on their own (Romans 3). All men are born with light
from God in conscience and in the spirit, (as you note), and rejection
of that light and the evidence of God's power and glory in nature
is cause for God's abiding and future wrath on mankind. Hebrews
1:1-4 further indicates that even the knowledge and information
given in the OT by the prophets was incomplete, but now God's
last and final word has come to us when God spoke through His
Son who is the heir of all things. Without the Bible we would
be animists or polytheists, totally confused and in great darkness
about ourselves and the nature of the one, true God.</P>

<P><B>The Danger of Reductionalism---There remains Great Mystery
in Creation:</B> God's dialogs with Job show that Job hasn't
figured out how God created things, and can't! Job does has a
good amount of knowledge about God derived from nature. He also
has a personal relationship with God and some years' experience
in matters of faith. Yet when God finally speaks to Job, the LORD's
response shows that man is unable to probe the mysteries of creation
to any depth! This is confirmed by Solomon who says: &quot;He
has made everything beautiful in its time; also he has put eternity
into man's mind, yet so that he (man) cannot find out what God
has done from the beginning to the end.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 3:11)
Isaiah records: &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
are your ways my ways, says the LORD. For as the heavens are higher
than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts
than your thoughts&quot;. (Isaiah 55:7-9) The passage in Ecclesiastes
seems to indicate that the mystery of time can not be unraveled
by man because God has hidden it. This may mean that we can not
establish once and for all whether or not the universe is old
or young. I believe that as history moves forward science and
the Bible must come into closer agreement, otherwise we are drawing
incorrect conclusions from our observations of nature. However
we must not insist that God did things in a certain way unless
we are given that information in Scripture. This is the difference
between naturalism and supernaturalism. A supernatural view of
the universe is not the same as a magical or mythical view, however.</P>

<P>Theistic evolution comes in two varieties: the first says that
God is the First Cause who built all the necessary things into
the original very low entropy of the universe and allowed all
the details to unfold naturally after t=0. The second view is
that the universe runs mostly by natural processes, but that God
intervenes occasionally to bring about exceedingly improbable
events such as the origin of life and transitions between species
(punctuated equilibrium, for example). Biblical creation takes
neither of these views. You claim not to believe in theistic evolution,
but you don't appear to me to depart too far from the premises
of the second type of theistic evolution.</P>

<P>&quot;Since the fall, however, man has sought to act independently
of his Creator. As one writer observes, 'Since the fall the human
mind has been wholly pagan.' The pagan mind resists submitting
results of its reason against Scripture as a check. It even desires
to stand as a judge of Scripture. There are just two ways to approach
issues. Either we view everything through the Bible, or we view
the Bible through man's autonomous ideas.&quot; (Donald E. Chittick,
<B><I>The Controversy Roots of the Creation-Evolution Conflict,</I></B>
Multnomah Press, Portland, 1984---this is an excellent book and
the author has a very fine reputation. He has a PhD in Chemistry).</P>

<P><B>The Physical World a World of Shadows:</B> The spiritual
is not far from the earth and outside of space and time beyond
the stars. It surrounds us within and without. In fact we are
immersed in spirit, and God Himself is a Spirit. When Paul the
Apostle visited Athens he noted: &quot;Men of Athens, I perceive
that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along,
and observed the objects of your worship, I found an altar with
this inscription, 'To an unknown God.' What you therefore worship
as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world
and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not
live in shrines made by man, nor is he served by human hands,
as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men
life and breath and everything. And he made from one (man, Adam)
every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having
determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation,
that they should seek God, in the hopes that they might feel after
him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, for 'In
him we live and move and have our being;' as even one of your
poets have said, 'For we are indeed his offspring.' Being then
God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is like
gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and imagination
of man. The times of ignorance God over-looked, but now he commands
all men everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which
he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has
appointed (Jesus), and of this he has given assurance to all men
by raising him from the dead.&quot; (Acts 17:22-31)</P>

<P><B>The spiritual realm,</B> which lies behind the smallest
atomic particles, within the innermost part of man, and beyond
the galaxies is commonly referred to as heaven, the heavenly places
in the Bible. It is the source of all things, the dimension of
the permanent, the eternal, the enduring: &quot;Now faith is the
assurance (hupostasis = &quot;to stand under&quot;, i.e., support,
foundation) of things not seen. For by faith the men of old gained
divine approval. By faith we understand that the world (aionos
= ages, or world) was created (katartizo = to fit, or render complete)
by the word (rhemati = the oracles, sayings, or spoken utterances)
of God, so that what is seen came into being out of that which
is unseen.&quot; (Hebrews 11:3) The physical world, the material
realm, is perfectly real and solid (not maya, or illusion, as
Hinduism supposes), but it is the world of the fading, the transitory,
the impermanent, and the perishable. Evil has disturbed our universe,
interfered with both the realm of the spirit and I think also
with some of the laws of physics (I agree with you that the Second
Law of Thermodynamics has probably not changed since creation).
But I suspect that evil (in both the angelic and human realms)
has destroyed the original close and harmonious coupling between
the spiritual and material dimensions of existence. What we now
see and observe and experience is not the creation as it was finished
at the end of the sixth day, but an aging, decaying old creation.
If we choose to know God through faith in Jesus His Son, we perceive
also that we are being made part of a new race, and prepared to
live in a new creation which is now under construction: &quot;So
we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away,
our inner nature is being renewed every day. For this slight momentary
affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond
all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen
but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen
are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.&quot;
(II Corinthians 5:6-8)</P>

<P>Consider a group of scientists who set up to study a redwood
tree. They measure the shadow of the tree cast by the sun. The
watch the shadow change as the day progresses. But they never
bother to touch or measure the tree itself. How much better it
is in attempting to scientifically understand trees to measure
real trees than merely their shadows. Thus we can not fully understand
the things of our physical world without some perception of the
enduring, permanent world of the spiritual. In C.S. Lewis' Great
Divorce, we have a good picture of heaven. The grass there is
so solid it hurts the feet of newcomers from earth who have not
walked around enough yet so as to toughen themselves, and to &quot;grow
more solid&quot; (they arrive as wisps of gray smoke from earth).
The spray of a waterfall is painful, attempts to wade in a rushing
stream are disastrous. Folks who have been in heaven awhile have
grown more solid from climbing into the mountains in the direction
of the light. The real universe includes the spiritual and the
eternal. They are not isolated and independent but are closely
coupled systems. These things modern science ignores.</P>

<P>A number of references in scripture tell us that things built
by God in the spiritual world are more solid, permanent, and durable
than their &quot;shadowy&quot; and temporary counterparts in the
physical world. For example, while on Mt. Sinai, God told Moses
to erect a Tabernacle and equip it with an elaborate set of furnishings:
an altar, a laver, a great lampstand, a table of incense, a table
for the shewbread, the Ark of the Covenant. The ark had to be
built exactly as prescribed in every detail, &quot;...And see
that you (Moses) make them (all these things) after the pattern
for them which is being shown to you on the mountain.&quot; (Exodus
25:40) The writer of the letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament
mentions the heavenly tabernacle when referring to Jesus as our
Great High Priest: &quot;Now the point in what we are saying is
this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the
sanctuary and the true tabernacle which is set up, not by man,
but by the Lord.&quot; (Hebrews 8:1-2) The writer continues: &quot;But
when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that
have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent, (not
made with hands, that, is not of this creation) he entered once
for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and
calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption...under
the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without
the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Thus it
was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified
by these rites, but the heavenly things with better sacrifices
than these. For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made
with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now
to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.&quot; (Hebrews
9:11-12, 22-24). Yet another reference to this heavenly tabernacle
or temple is given in Revelation 15:5-8. One cannot hope to learn
much about reality by looking at the shadows of things instead
of their real form and substance! We cannot hope to understand
ourselves or the universe (the heavens and the earth) if we ignore
the information God has given us about the whole package. From
a Biblical standpoint we can not hope to understand the physical
world if we ignore the spiritual.</P>

<P><B>The Creator is the Observer in Genesis One:</B> It is quite
true that the observer is on earth starting with Genesis 1:2 and
that the narrative concentrates on the earth, but perhaps it is
reading something into the Scripture to say that the earth was
covered with a thick cloud layer shutting out of the sun. (Job
38 does suggest clouds around the early earth). Genesis 1:1,2
may apply to the raw material of the entire universe being brought
into being in darkness, not just the conditions prevailing on
the earth itself. The origin of the sun before the earth is surmised
by science but nowhere stated in Scripture. I believe that as
responsible Christians we must always be careful not to force
our current theories to fit the Bible. The Bible must sit in judgment
over all of our frail and tentative ideas derived from science.</P>

<P>Just who is the observer in Genesis 1? It is not an angel,
not Moses, not Adam. The Observer is the Creator Himself, who
after creating studies His own work and pronounces it good. This
is clear I think from Proverbs 8 (we know from the NT that Christ
is the Wisdom of God): &quot;The LORD possessed me (Wisdom) at
the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old. Ages
ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were
no springs abounding with water. Before the mountains had been
shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth; before he had made
the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.
When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle
on the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when
he established the fountains of the deep, when he assigned to
the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his
command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then
I was beside him, like a master workman; and I was daily his delight,
rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his inhabited world
and delighting in the sons of men. And now, my sons, listen to
me: happy are those who keep my ways. Hear instruction and be
wise, and do not neglect it. Happy is the man who listens to me,
watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. For he who
finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD; but he who
misses me injures himself; all who hate me love death.&quot;</P>

<P>God's creation of the universe was like the work of a master
craftsman. First He brought the raw material into existence. Then
He formed the raw material, fashioning it like a potter at the
wheel or like an artist working from a pallet. The elements seem
to have all been created first, but the building, forming, and
fashioning of the creation extended over six days. I do not think
the six days must necessarily be exactly 24 hour days, but to
suggest long geologic ages is forcing the text in my opinion.
God is imminently involved in the work of creation. Evidently,
the entropy of the early universe was lowered in stages, as order
and design were built into the universe by the activity of the
Spirit of God.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Literal&quot; Interpretation of Genesis:</B> If one
sets aside for the moment all one thinks is true about creation,
based on science, then Genesis says that God first created space,
including the spiritual world, water and earth. Then He brought
light into existence by divine fiat. All this on the first day.
Now &quot;God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all.&quot;
Physical light is, however, something God created. The universe
seems to have been dark up until light was created. This makes
the Big Bang model highly suspect! God proceeded to mold and shape
his new universe bringing the sun, moon and stars into existence
on the fourth day, and so forth. If I were to develop a science
of astronomy where none previously existed I would begin with
Genesis as a revelation from God, then pray, then look at the
evidence. This would be the only way I could hope to sort out
the available data in the correct way. This is not the process
that modern astronomy followed in coming to its presently-held
models. No matter how elegant they are I must hold theories such
as the Big Bang as highly tentative and quite possibly wrong.
It is not that the facts or basic observations are all wrong,
or that God has deceived me. The fault lies with the interpretation
of the suite of available data. As men of God we must not give
listeners the impression that we are adding to the Bible or that
our own particular interpretation is superior than another point
of view which other godly men subscribe to. &quot;You shall not
add to the word which I command you, nor take from it; that you
may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command
you.&quot; (Deuteronomy 4:2)</P>

<P><B>The Big Bang Model means a &quot;hands off universe&quot;:</B>
The whole idea of the big bang is that the history of the universe
is totally determined once the initial conditions have been fixed.
No real room for subsequent intervention by God. You yourself
note this eloquently in your talks. Any divine interventions would
upset the delicate balance rendering the present cosmology incorrect.
This contrasts with a universe formed and fashioned in every detail
by a loving Craftsman. The Big Bang theory is an extrapolation
into the remote past---a theory based on present observables and
a set of assumptions. The non-involvement of God after t=0 is
presupposed by this theory. This can not be established from Scripture
as the way things really happened. &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;
is a powerful command of God, calling light into existence. For
the Son of God to merely roll back the cloud layer covering the
earth so as to let the light from space shine onto the earth would
be a trivial command. Likewise for most of the creative work of
God to be condensed into &quot;the creation event&quot;, i.e.
the hypothetical big bang explosion, leaves God very little work
to do during the ensuing six days. The Christian church has always
understood God as having spoken the universe into existence by
a series of commands. This is brought out in John Chapter One.
If most of the important work of creating the universe is all
over and done with by the end of Genesis 1:2, the commands that
follow on the remaining five days are miniscule in comparison,
except for the emergence of life. However the commands that bring
life into being are weighted equally with the rest of the spoken
words of God calling everything into being.</P>

<P><B>The Role of the angels in nature.</B> The observed precision
of the laws of physics could well be due to the precision work
of angels regulating all natural process during our present epoch.
We must be careful to avoid naturalism as an explanation for what
we observe in the world by the limited tools of science. For example
in the calming of the sea of Galilee, Jesus spoke to an angel:
&quot;On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, 'Let
us go across to the other side.' And leaving the crowd, they took
him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were
with him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat
into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was
in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said
to him, 'Teacher, do you not care if we perish?' And he awoke
and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, &quot;Peace! Be still!&quot;
And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them,
'Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?' And they were filled
with awe, and said to one another, 'Who then is this, that even
wind and sea obey him?'&quot; (Mark 4:35-41) Does God bring about
the events of the Book of Revelation by stepping in and changing
the laws of physics, or does He merely command the angels who
control all the forces of nature and they begin to move in different
ways? I think the latter is probably closer to the way things
work. The difference between naturalism and Biblical supernaturalism
is very great, especially in our time. I must allow for the possibility
that science could be seriously wrong on some issues because of
deliberate exclusion of God from scientific thoughts and processes
in the past 150 years. (There is a trend back towards supernaturalism
in some sectors, but often it is a reversion to eastern mysticism,
not a return to a Biblical view).</P>

<P><B>Astrology</B> as you note in your printed essay is based
on Nimrod's false religion from Babylon. I would agree with you
as a physicist that there are no known physical mechanisms that
could explain how the position of the planets at the time of one's
birth could possibly influence personality. And as you state,
astrology is forbidden to us by the Bible because it brings us
under the influence of demonic powers in the occult realm. But
if there are angels associated with the stars and planets that
the influence of these angels on the quality of human life is
not unreasonable from a Biblical view point. (C.S. Lewis develops
this idea in the first book of his science fiction trilogy, Out
of the Silent Planet). In any case we do not have a pure Hebrew
astrology today but only the pagan, thoroughly corrupted version
from the Babylonian mystery religion. For secular scientists to
be concerned about negating astrology is understandable when the
basis of modern science is naturalism and rationalism and when
supernaturalism is excluded from the discussion. (See enclosure
on recent research paper concerning The Mars Effect). In a sense
astrology is difficult to study by the scientific method because
the data tends to be mostly subjective among the community of
believers in this &quot;art.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Your day-age arguments:</B> The narrative in Genesis One
draws on the imagery of the calendar week known to us until today.
There are seven days in our weeks, by the term evening and morning
we always mean 24 hour days. When the Bible means &quot;age&quot;
it is usually so stated. The term &quot;Day of the LORD&quot;
is obviously an extended period from the context in which it is
used. For instance each of the Genesis creation days is an evening
and a morning. The use of the term &quot;evening and morning&quot;
to refer to a long period of time is not known in Scripture. In
English we do say, &quot;this is the dawning of a new age&quot;
but we mean an historical epoch or era not a geologic period.
If you decide to hold to the day-age theory you should acknowledge
that godly Bible scholars have many arguments for these days being
24 hour days from internal Biblical evidence. The case can not
be decided on the basis of science. It may be that we have to
live with considerable tension between the modern scientific view
and the Biblical picture of things. Have you seen the excellent
discussion featuring both sides (the day-age and the 24 hour day)
featured in <B><I>The Genesis Debate,</I></B> Ronald Youngblood,
Ed., (Thos. Nelson Publishers, 1986)?</P>

<P><B>Events on the Sixth Day:</B> Creation of the higher animals
and man. The text does not say that Adam studied, analyzed and
named the animals on the sixth day. The creation of man as male/female
occurred on the sixth day, but the separation of Adam/Eve into
Adam and Eve evidently came later. The best explanation is that
Eve was taken out of Adam months or years after the creation of
Adam. Before Eve was presented to him, Adam had ample time to
study and name the animals. Likewise we do not know how many months
or years elapsed before the fall. Adam died at age 930 so we can
set some limits on when he was created. Adam was created as an
adult, evidently, so his body would carry an appearance of initial
age, perhaps 30 years or so.</P>

<P><B>&quot;The Seventh Day is still open&quot;:</B> Scripture
does not say this. Please note that the Scripture says &quot;God
rested on the seventh day&quot;, not &quot;God is resting&quot;.
All this means is that God's creative activity ceased at a certain
point of time. God did not rest from other activities such as
the daily sustenance of the old creation, nor the building of
the new creation through the Last Adam. The absence of an evening
on the seventh day is not a proof for the day-age theory, but
would tend to deny continuous creation models. The rest we are
all to enter into by faith is described in Hebrews 4. It may be
compared to God's rest on the seventh day, rest from wilderness
wanderings under Joshua, rest from warfare under King David,etc.
The pattern of the seven days of creation is a repeated pattern
remembered in the Jewish calendar week.</P>

<P><B>The Eighth Day:</B> The millennium is nowhere called the
&quot;eighth day&quot; in Scripture. In a literal sense there
is no eighth day in the Bible. In a symbolic sense the eight day,
the day of new beginnings, began with the resurrection of our
Lord Jesus. Whenever the Bible talks about the eighth day it is
always the first day of the week after the Sabbath. I do not feel
that the symbolism of the 8th day fits the millennium very well.
The 1000 year reign of Christ on earth is more of a fulfillment
of the Feast of Tabernacles I think.</P>

<P><B>A Local or Universal Flood?</B> Either there is no evidence
for a world-wide flood, as you claim, or the evidence is so overwhelming
it is everywhere. The topography of the earth before the flood
was probably radically different from now. I believe that there
was one land mass (continent) before the flood. If the present
continents were flattened with a bulldozer one could cover everything
to considerable depth with presently existing water. A drastic
change in land mass distribution, mountains, valleys, topography
at the time of the flood seems most reasonable to me. To give
just one example, the isostatic loading and unloading of a great
amount of water over the land would be a major impact in subsequent
mountain building. The present Mt. Ararat (16,900 feet) is a volcano
and may be of recent origin. The ark may have landed on relatively
low hills. Mt. Everest may have been elevated subsequent to the
flood, for example during the Days of Peleg when accelerated continental
drift may have occurred. A different land-mass distribution in
and of itself would soon change the climate and weather patterns
world wide. I seem to be less of a uniformitarian than you.
The Bible uses vivid language to describe the destruction of all
of mankind and a great natural disaster at the time of the flood.
This inclines me strongly to believe the flood was a great and
terrible world-wide catastrophe which changed our present earth
drastically.</P>

<P><B>Satan's domain and power:</B> Evil in the universe is not
confined to man. Satan may have been the greatest of all the angels,
his revolt with one third of the angelic host, may have disrupted
things radically throughout the universe since his fall. There
is good reason to suppose that Satan and his angels have wreaked
havoc in creation, marring and scarring it in attempts to destroy
what God made.</P>

<P><B>Miracles are a Complex Subject.</B> Are these outside energy
inputs from the spiritual world, or are they mere arrangements
of things within our space-time domain? Did the resurrection of
Jesus affect the natural order? Science does not ordinarily investigate
one-of-a-kind events. The daily sustenance of the universe by
God's power may be one continuous miracle which we see as a set
of immutable laws of nature.</P>

<P><B>Frequency of earthquakes increasing?</B> I have never seen
any data on this frequent claim by TV evangelists. Is it only
that earthquakes are now recorded and studied more diligently
and carefully? I assume the increase of natural disturbances in
the tribulation period is a result of God's intervening judgments?
If earthquakes are now more frequent, what is the causal mechanism?
Especially in a universe 1010 years old why would earthquakes
soar in the last 100 years (only one part in 108 years of history)?
My reading of the Olivet Discourse suggests to me that escalating
earthquakes and natural disasters characterize the Great Tribulation
period (3.5 years), not the &quot;last days&quot;, i.e. not the
last 2000 years. I would be most grateful for any references you
might have on earthquake frequency.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Universe A can Never Interact with Universe B&quot;:</B>
This is surely true only for material universes. Our universe
is surrounded by an unseen spiritual realm which is the source
of all things. God sustains the universe from the realm of the
spirit, interacting with the physical world in ways not known
to us. &quot;How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past
finding out.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Jesus' role in sustaining the universe by His mighty word
of power:</B> To assume that God wound up the universe at the
start of the Big Bang and made a few creative additions afterwards
(in the six days of creation) leans towards naturalism or theistic
evolution. God is more than a First Cause. The Bible says a lot
about His day by day involvement in the world. He did not create
the universe and then depart to play the role of a spectator observer.
Note for example Colossians 1:16-17 &quot;For by him all things
were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things
were created by him and for him. He is before all things, and
in him all things hold together.&quot; Also, Hebrews 1:1-4: &quot;In
many separate revelations - each of which set forth a portion
of the Truth - and in different ways God spoke of old to [our]
forefathers in and by the prophets, [But] in the last of these
days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son, Whom He appointed
Heir and lawful Owner of all things, also by and through Whom
He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of
time - (that is) He made, produced, built, operated and arranged
them in order. He is the sole expression of the glory of God -
the Light-being, the out-raying or radiance of the divine - and
He is the perfect imprint and very image of [God's] nature, upholding
and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His
mighty word of power...&quot;</P>

<P><B>Jesus governs all things:</B> C.S. Lewis says that all science
can really say is that Humpty Dumpty is falling down, (<I>Miracles,</I>
1947, Macmillan Publishers---this book has an excellent discussion
of the difference between a naturalistic and a supernaturalistic
view of the universe). The Bible knows nothing of natural law.
Instead God regulates everything in perfect harmony. He rules
over every facet of nature through His angels. All His workings
are in perfect balance and harmony. He rules from the spiritual
world into the physical. Some angels may well be &quot;unstable
governors&quot; producing unusual events in the heavens such as
novas and supernovas. Again we must be careful to avoid reductionism
and naturalism! The angels are more than observers.</P>

<P><B>Vapor Canopy Model:</B> Translating &quot;mist&quot; as
normal rainfall seems very strained. How can rain come up out
of the ground to water the earth? A lot of scientific work has
been done on a vapor canopy model and much of what I have seen
is quite reasonable science. Genesis 2:6 does seem to describe
a period before which there was no rain on the earth. The Ice
Canopy Model. Donald Patten in general is far out, like Velikovsky
was. I agree with you that there seems to be no real substance
to Patten's models. I have his books but keep them in my pseudoscience
collection.</P>

<P><B>A Geocentric Universe?</B> Science does not know where the
center of the universe is. The fact that earth as inhabitable
is so incredibly unlikely in all the known universe is suspicious.
Earth is the moral center of the universe. We can't prove the
earth is not the center of the universe! The Son of God appears
to have created the universe from the earth as a vantage point.
Presumably the center of the universe is located where the throne
room of God is located, but that is in the heavenlies. As far
as the physical universe is concerned earth emerges as mighty
important and completely unique according to your own very fine
analysis of the improbability of another planet like ours in the
known universe.</P>

<P><B>An Aesthetic Argument.</B> The universe has existed for
1010 years but man for only 104 years? To me this does not seem
reasonable for a universe created by the Logos of God. To have
an empty universe before man for great periods of time seems strange:
&quot;For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!),
who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not
create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): 'I am the LORD,
and there is no other.'&quot; (Isaiah 45:18). The Anthropic Principle
is not quite right, however the Creator made man most like Himself
and made the universe as a home for man, and man given the charge
to have dominion. Beauty and harmony in nature are evidence of
God's handiwork, but beauty and elegance in science may not be!
Since Jesus, the Logos of God created the universe, it is not
unreasonable that the creation should have some features which
remind man of himself. Also, Satanic counterfeits are as close
to the truth as possible, so we need to be especially cautious
about new theories that appear to give all the right answers at
first.. Intuitively I would expect the creation events to follow
one another in rapid order. God is a God of beauty and harmony.
He is the Supreme Architect and the Master Builder.</P>

<P><B>Absolute Time.</B> We must be careful not to claim our clocks
run on the same standard as God's clocks! The writer of Genesis
can only make a record when someone tells him how to keep time.
Modern science assumes time is an absolute, and that man has that
clock in his hands. The clock we are given for keeping time by
in Genesis is the motion of sun, moon and stars for an observer
on earth.</P>

<P><B>Constancy of Atomic Constants:</B> At least four careful
statistical analyses by competent statisticians in the last two
years claim that the available data on measurements of the velocity
of light give confidence levels of 90-95% that c is not a fixed
constant. These findings can not be now dismissed so lightly.
Quite independent of this statistical information, it is perfectly
possible to hypothesize that c is not a constant and examine the
consequences in various equations and phenomena of physics. Barry
Setterfield claims the results of doing this very thing are quite
realistic and that the resulting model is better than the existing
one and more consistent with the Bible. There is no a priori reason
why c should be a fixed constant, either in physics or in theology.
It is very easy for science to overlook things, and to oversimplify
according to Occam's Razor. The new science of chaos is a good
example. Lo and behold even in chaos there is often order emerging
from the noise if one looks for it in the right way. God's actions
in controlling the universe and regulating its every detail could
be entirely in the noise level---&quot;O the depth of the riches
and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments
and how inscrutable his ways! 'For who has known the mind of the
Lord, or who has been his counselor?' 'Or who has given a gift
to him that he might be repaid?' For from him and through him
and to him are all things. To him be glory for ever. Amen.&quot;
(Romans 11:33-36)</P>

<P><B>Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin:</B> A strong view of man's
total depravity leads one to conclude that the effects of human
evil have a big effect on nature. I believe human evil has had
such a big effect on nature.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Death&quot; in the Bible:</B> Normally the word &quot;death&quot;
in the Bible carries with it extremely negative connotations.
Primarily there are three kinds of death (1) physical death, (2)
spiritual death, and (3) the Second Death. Metaphors as such as
being &quot;dead to sin&quot; or &quot;dead to the law&quot; do
not carry the same weight as death which &quot;enters the world
through Adam's sin.&quot; Genesis 2:17 is very emphatic in Hebrew,
&quot;dying you shall die.&quot; Death is our great enemy, &quot;the
last enemy to be destroyed is death...&quot; &quot;Since therefore
the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook
of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who
has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those
who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.&quot;
(Hebrews 2). I agree that there might have been a form of animal
death in the world before the fall. But death is viewed as man's
great and final enemy: &quot;Therefore as sin came into the world
through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to
all men because all men sinned--sin indeed was in the world before
the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.
Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins
were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the
one who was to come.&quot; (Romans 5:12-14). It is reasonable
to suppose that the animals multiplied and died before the fall---I
don't know of any Scripture that specifically states this however.
Possibly natural birth control prevailed among animals and men
in the early days so that conception was much rarer or the sexual
urge more easily controlled. Even if the animals died before the
fall, they evidently were not subject to disease and violent destruction
(not as we have now, &quot;nature red in tooth and claw&quot;).
Isaiah speaks of the wolf lying down with the lamb and nature
being subdued. I take this to mean a return to conditions that
prevailed before the fall. Even so, death entered the human race
as a result of sin and is not natural for our race. I think it
is misleading to claim that death is &quot;beneficial.&quot; I
believe the battle between good and evil is fiercely pitched and
that very powerful forces are at work to keep man ignorant of
who God really is, or to throw us onto tangents once we do come
to know Him. The devil would overthrow God Himself if he could,
and destroy all life in the universe at the same time. The devil
is not only a liar, he is a murderer from the beginning.</P>

<P><B>&quot;Species go extinct naturally all the time&quot;.</B>
It is pure speculation on your part to suppose this is the way
things always have been in the past. This is what we now observe,
but we have no way of knowing that this is the way things always
have been. Adam was given dominion over creation. It was his job
to tend the garden and subdue the earth. In yielding himself to
the enemy Adam lost the power and the title deed to the earth,
plunging the created order into disarray. It is entirely possible
that species die-offs are a result of the fall and the bondage
all creation has been subject to as a result of the fall: &quot;The
creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be
revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration (douleia=bondage),
not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected
it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its
bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the
children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning
as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not
only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the
redemption of our bodies.&quot; (Romans 8)</P>

<P><B>&quot;Our Bodies Are Made from Ashes of Dead Stars&quot;.</B>
This is also speculation---you are relying on the &quot;authority&quot;
of a scientific model, and science has no real authority from
God. We do not know where the dust of the earth was actually brought
into existence through stellar nuclear reactions, or whether the
present distribution of the elements appeared abruptly by fiat
creation. We must be careful to avoid causality---suggesting that
God was constrained or is constrained to act only in certain ways.
It seems to me from Genesis that God directly created the earth.
No mechanism or intermediate stages for the formation of the earth
are given in the Bible and we must be careful not add to Scripture,
or to read into the Bible thinks that aren't there. On matters
where Scripture is silent, we must be silent, or state clearly
that we are speculating!</P>

<P><B>Pre-Adamic hominids.</B> There is no hint of such in the
Bible. You should state this clearly as a matter of your own personal
belief based on science but not supported by the Bible. This reminds
one of the Gap Theory which is now widely discredited, as you
yourself believe. We must be careful in our desires to harmonize
science and the Bible not to be dogmatic about scientific truth
or even the set of facts available for our interpretation. &quot;Let
God be true though every man be false, as it is written...&quot;</P>

<P><B>Longevity of the Patriarchs.</B> The mechanism for reduced
human longevity after the flood is not known, however a number
of scientists have commented that increased flux of harmful cosmic
rays probably would not account for the full amount of the decrease.
Perhaps we need a biologist to tell us more about the aging processes,
genetic damage, and possible causal mechanisms.</P>

<P><B>Missing Gaps in the Genealogies of the Bible.</B> As far
as I am able to determine the gaps in some of the genealogies
in the Bible are almost all filled in elsewhere. The gaps are
all minor in any case and the actual history of the gap-periods
is usually known from elsewhere in the Biblical text. It is thus
very difficult (I believe) to move Adam earlier than 5000 to 6000
B.C. Henry Morris concedes 10,000 years maximum. We must always
be careful not to try and force the Scriptures to fit a contemporary
science model of the fossil record. Chronologies are given for
the line which leads from the First Adam to the Last Adam, so
the Holy Spirit seems to have gone to extra trouble to give as
an unbroken record of the blood line to Messiah. Your analysis
of the apparent gaps would be helpful to see how you reach 10,000
to 25,000 years B.P. for Adam.</P>

<P>The Thomas Gold model for origin of petroleum and coal deposits
is probably much better than the old model. Far too much gas,
oil and coal has been found already to be attributed to a biogenic
origin. These resources usually found along crustal found zones.
Gold's deep earth methane model is consistent with a cold, accretionary
formation of the earth. The old model of petroleum genesis is
well over 100 years old and sadly outdated. For example the old
model holds to a hot-molten-glob formation of the earth and all
oil resources a result of biogenesis. (See T. Gold, <B><I>Power
from the Earth,</I></B> 1987, $24.95). Regarding the formation
of the earth note that Peter says the earth was &quot;formed (compacted)
out of water and by means of water.&quot; The Hebrew root word
of erets means &quot;to compact together.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Pleochroic halos.</B> This topic needs more study and comment.
The work of Robert Gentry is too thorough and too careful than
to be lightly dismissed. Either the earth was formed suddenly,
or radioactive decay did not start up until after the earth was
formed. I can not see any way around the basic evidence from these
halos at the present time. I assume you have Gentry's book?</P>

<P><B>The Gospel and Modern Man.</B> I believe that apologetics
generally has its greatest value among those who are already believers.
The Gospel makes its appeal to conscience. Man's obstacle is pride
and unbelief. The fact that the usual Genesis 1-11 interpretations
impede modern man from coming to Christ does not mean these men
will not be saved. Men will be saved by God if they are elected
to salvation and have been chosen in Christ from the foundation
of the world. Moral issues are more dominant. We must let the
Bible govern our thinking whether or not the Bible is in accord
with modern scientific views. Over long periods of time the scientific
view should be more consistent with the Bible, but not necessarily
in a short time frame, say 100 years. Entire civilizations have
been misled in the past. Satan comes as an angel of light. Ancient
Egypt had a very advanced science and effective, convincing magic
arts and sorcery during the times of Joseph and Moses. Antichrist
will evidently have a credible, convincing cosmology to support
his view about the naturalistic origin of the universe. If, as
you say, most modern astronomers are now deists I would still
not expect dozens of them to flood into the church and be saved
because of the impediment of intellectual pride, &quot;For consider
your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly
standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth;
but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise,
God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, God chose
what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not,
to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might
boast in the presence of God.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Creation and the Supreme Court:</B> You claim the real issue
causing opposition to the teaching of creation in schools is really
over the age of the universe. I disagree! I think that opposition
to God and to the gospel is what is happening on such front-line
engagements as the Supreme Court disputes about origins. I feel
certain that the real tension these days is between naturalism
and supernaturalism. As Frances Schaeffer has noted, modern man
with his insistence on the materialistic universe being all there
is, is threatened when He gets any hint that God might not be
dead after all. Spiritual warfare is what's going on, and that
struggle is not much dependent on the details of the belief system
of the two sides. You'll find the same heated disputes in the
abortion issue. The Christian side rightly values every individual
life as a creation of God. The pro-abortionists insist they have
a right to do as they please with their own bodies, not only with
regard to abortion, but also including freedom to engage in casual
sex without benefit of marriage. The first group believes man
must be subject to God to be free and whole, the second group
subscribes to the notion than man can be autonomous.</P>

<P><B>The Earth's Magnetic Field.</B> No dynamo mechanism has
ever been found to explain the postulated energy inputs needed
to sustain the field. The measured field appears to be decreasing
exponentially with a half life of only a few thousand years. The
reversals before the current epoch certainly seem to be real---see
Russ Humphreys' article in latest CRSQ for recent discussion of
field reversals in the past. The early work of Thomas Barnes on
the decay of the earth's field is perfectly credible even if his
current work concerning relativity seems less so.</P>

<P><B>Psalm 104:30 and the &quot;recreation&quot; of life:</B>
&quot;When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew
the face of the earth.&quot; This whole Psalm is concerned with
the worship of the God of creation. It does not suggest to me
that God &quot;recreated&quot; anything after the close of creation
week. The idea that God &quot;recreates&quot; anything does not
correspond to anything I know about from Scripture.</P>

<P><B>Your UFO treatment</B> is excellent, careful and thorough,
except that Richard Haines (former NASA scientist and fellow member
of Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto) says UFO sightings seem
to fall into two classes: positive and malevolent. I sent Dick
your UFO tapes as he is keenly interested in getting to know you.</P>

<P><B>The Universe is a Home for Man.</B> Jesus said, &quot;Let
not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me.
In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would
I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when
I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take
you to myself, that where I am you may be also.&quot; (John 14:1-3)
Here &quot;the Father's house&quot; is clearly the universe we
live in, the whole universe, which is made up of both the visible
and the invisible. The universe, Jesus implied, is to be compared
to a house having many rooms, all made to live in. Like the homes
we live in, the various rooms serve various purposes. We have
living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms and perhaps a library-study.
The first helpful thing about this passage is that it teaches
us that heaven is a better and more pleasant home than the best
we know here. This is not fiction or myth; Jesus was describing
the way things really are. Further clues about the universe as
a &quot;house&quot; designed to be lived in can be found elsewhere
in the Bible. For example Yahweh says in Isaiah: &quot;For thus
says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed
the earth and made it (he established it); he did not create it
a chaos, he formed it (to be inhabited!): I am the LORD, and there
is no other.&quot; (Isaiah 45:18) &quot;Heaven is my throne and
the earth is my footstool; what is the house which you would build
for me, and what is the place of my rest? All these things my
hand has made, and so all these things are mine, says the LORD.
But this is the man to whom I will look, he that is humble and
contrite in spirit and who trembles at my word.&quot; (Isaiah
66:1,2) If we know now only that God's house contains a living
room chair and its accompanying footstool, we nevertheless can
infer the existence of kitchens, closets, banquet halls and libraries.
For example, God's library must surely contain books in four-dimensional
living color that contain in minute detail the history of the
world as it really happened. Surely we shall find video tapes
there containing the lives of all who have ever lived with thoughts,
motives, and actual facts in open-books before us. After visiting
the library, we might like to move outdoors and investigate the
gardens in heaven after which Eden was patterned. In contrast
with these statements the universe as seen by the astronomer's
limited eyesight seems to me to be cold, sterile, impersonal and
limited. The astronomer is looking at shadows that pale in comparison
with the real. Reality is perceived accurately only through the
eyes of faith.</P>

<P><B>Uniformitarianism is Specifically Denied in Scripture.</B>
In spite of a renewal of interest in catastrophism in recent years,
man's belief in some form of uniformitarianism has characterized
society since the beginning. Modern science is still quite uniformitarian
in its ideas. Surely this deeply embedded notion in our minds
that things never really have changed since creation is the reason
the Apostle Peter left us such a clear word in his second epistle:
&quot;First of all you must understand this, that skeptics will
come in the last days with scoffing, following their own passions
and saying, 'Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since
the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were
from the beginning of creation.' They deliberately ignore this
fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and an
earth formed out of water and by means of water, through which
the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.
But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist have
been stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment
and destruction of ungodly men. But do not ignore this one fact,
beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and
a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise
as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing
that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens
will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved
with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be
burned up. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what
sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,
waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because
of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved, and the elements
will melt with fire! But according to his promise we wait for
new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore,
beloved, since you wait for these, be zealous to be found by him
without spot or blemish, and at peace. And count the forbearance
of our Lord as salvation. (2 Peter 3)</P>

<P><B>Truth is a Person.</B> &quot;I am the Way and the Truth
and the Life, no man comes to the Father except by me.&quot; Paul
says, &quot;In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.&quot; Solomon writes in Proverbs, &quot;It is the glory
of God to conceal things; it is the glory of kings to seek them
out.&quot; The person who does know Christ or is ignorant on how
to search out hidden truth be unlikely to discover an accurate
cosmological model. &quot;The natural man does not understand
the things of the Spirit of God, indeed they are foolishness to
him, and he can not know them because they are spiritually discerned.
The spiritual man understands all things...&quot;</P>

<P>Though your Christian faith and theology seems orthodox, my
world view is a bit different from yours based on your presentations
to date. Your dual-revelation ideas trouble me. I do not believe
modern astronomers have arrived at absolute knowledge concerning
the age of the universe or the methodology of God's creative hand,
for instance through the Big Bang hypothesis. In general I like
to put more emphasis on the importance of the spiritual realm
in understanding creation than you do. I am concerned that you
err in the direction of naturalism, progressive creationism, and
scientism. I have less confidence in modern scientific models
and am willing to live with considerable tension between science
and the Bible. I believe the most important creative activity
of God took place on the Six Days rather than being limited to
Genesis 1:1,2. I believe the Six Days were relatively short periods
of time, not long geologic ages. I believe in a universal, not
local, flood. I place time of Adam and the time of the flood more
recently than you, and I therefore suspect radio-dating methods
may be in error. I suspect the present interpretation of the fossil
record is in error on some key points. I believe the topography
of the earth and the climate changed radically at the time of
the flood. I think there is every likelihood the universe has
been seriously disrupted since it was created. This is a result
of the cosmic rebellion among the angels under Lucifer, and the
fall of man. I believe death came into the human race through
the sin of Adam and that death is our great enemy. I do not believe
there were any hominids on earth before Adam, and that the higher
animals and Adam all came into being in the same time frame on
the Sixth Day. I believe so-called &quot;cave men&quot; are degenerate
branches of the race descended from Adam. Thus conventional dating
schemes are suspect. I am convinced that scientific theories developed
by sinful man (under the control of Satan, a deceiver and a murderer
from the beginning) are frequently incomplete and tentative and
need to be treated that way. &quot;For our knowledge is imperfect
and our prophecy is imperfect; but when the perfect comes, the
imperfect will pass away...For now we see in a mirror dimly, but
then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand
fully, even as I have been fully understood.&quot;</P>

<P>Your presentations as they now stand seem to me like a half-way
station between the world of the modern secular scientist and
Biblical Christianity. I am sure you can continue to have a major
impact in academic environments where science dominates thinking
and discussions. My greatest concern is that you seem to me to
be taking your own secular scientific world-view and attempting
to force-fit it to the Scripture. I suppose this is partly what
a good harmonist seeks to do in any generation. But if you are
too dogmatic and opinionated about matters of science now, you
may find yourself &quot;obsolete&quot; in a few years time. I
think you would improve your presentations greatly if you made
a clearer distinction concerning matters of scientific opinion
and statements of belief based on the Bible. Perhaps you might
want to mention that many godly men, Bible scholars and scientists
who are Christians differ in their view of creation from your
position yet that may not mean they are wrong and you are right.
These issues seem to me to resemble the story of three blind Indians
who discover their first elephant. One says elephants are like
thin ropes, another says they are like walls, a third says they
resemble tree trunks. Yet all are correct though each is complete
by itself. In matters of science and the Bible it is not always
a question of &quot;either/or&quot; but of &quot;both/and&quot;---holding
what appear to be irreconcilable forms of information in tension
until a way of resolution is found later on. My caution to you
as your brother in Christ is that we all need to approach the
Bible with open, uncluttered minds and let the Word of God enlighten
us and constantly judge our understanding of things. In that process
I think it is important to set aside temporarily what we think
to be true from science and human experience. Being a good apologist
you will I'm sure you want to revise your scientific material
every year as so to keep current with our changing scientific
understanding of things. And I am sure you and I will continue
to grow in Christ so that we gain further light on the marvelous
creation and our place in it. As scientists I do not think we
really have a head start on truth, in fact we may be more easily
impeded in our search for truth because of the danger of being
puffed up by our own worldly accomplishments. &quot;If any thinks
himself wise in this world let him become a fool, that he might
be truly wise.&quot; May our God bless you richly, beyond all
your hopes and expectations.</P>

<P>Sincerely, your brother in Christ,</P>

<P><B>Problems Emerging with Big Bang Cosmology</B></P>

<P>Hugh Ross defends that Big Bang theory as if it were the proven
process by which our universe was brought into existence a long
time ago. Astronomer Tom Van Flandern, who is neither a creationist
nor a believer in a recent origin for the universe, nevertheless
is not afraid of challenging the prevailing secular orthodoxy
in astronomy. In his latest Meta Research Bulletin news section
(12/15/97) he lists:</P>

<P><B>Ten Problems with the Big Bang</B></P>

<P>For a recent chat discussion on MSN, we prepared a list of
the leading problems faced by the big bang in its struggle for
viability as a theory:</P>

<P>(1) Static universe models fit the data better than expanding
universe models.</P>

<P>(2) The microwave &quot;background&quot; makes more sense as
the limiting temperature of space heated by starlight than as
the remnant of a fireball.</P>

<P>(3) Element abundance predictions using the big bang require
too many adjustable parameters to make them work.</P>

<P>(4) The universe has too much large scale structure (interspersed
&quot;walls&quot; and voids) to form in a time as short as 10-20
billion years.</P>

<P>(5) The average luminosity of quasars must decrease with time
in just the right way so that their mean apparent brightness is
the same at all redshifts, which is exceedingly unlikely.</P>

<P>(6) The ages of globular clusters appear older than the universe.</P>

<P>(7) The local streaming motions of galaxies are too high for
a finite universe that is supposed to be everywhere uniform.</P>

<P>(8) Invisible dark matter of an unknown but non-baryonic nature
must be the dominant ingredient of the entire universe.</P>

<P>(9) The most distant galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field show
insufficient evidence of evolution, with some of them apparently
having higher redshifts (z = 6-7) than the faintest quasars.</P>

<P>(l0) If the open universe we see today is extrapolated back
near the beginning, the ratio of the actual density of matter
in the universe to the critical density must differ from unity
by just a part in 10^59. My larger deviation would result in a
universe already collapsed on itself or already dissipated.</P>

<P><B>A Strong New Big Bang Falsification Test</B></P>

<P>Is the redshift of galaxy light due to the expansion of the
universe, or due to energy loss? If redshift were due to cosmological
expansion, then all galaxies within a cluster would have the same
cosmological redshift plus a small add-on contribution due to
local motion within the cluster. The average dispersion of velocities
within clusters would be independent of their distance from us
except for possible evolutionary effects. On the other hand, if
light redshift is with distance traveled because it loses energy,
small dispersions at small redshifts would become larger dispersions
at larger redshifts. The dispersion in redshift within clusters
would increase linearly with distance. To be safe, corrections
for Malmquist bias must be applied because we see only the most
massive clusters at great distances. Of course, if velocity dispersion
is shown to increase linearly with distance, someone might propose
that cluster masses increase with the square of distance as one
looks back toward the big bang, because this would give the same
effect. However, such a proposal would contradict the mass-luminosity
relationship. It therefore appears that such a test result would
definitively falsify the big bang. Preliminary results in AJ,
857-867 (1994), ApJ 423, L89-L92 (1994), ApJ 478, 39-48 (1997)
and AJ 114 1293-1296 (1997) rather suggest that this test will
in fact falsify the big bang. In the last of these, an X-ray emitting
cluster at redshift z = 0.813 was reported with a velocity dispersion
of 1892 km/s. This dispersion is so great that it makes the cluster
appear to be spread into a filament shape along the line of sight.
The only alternative is that &quot;velocity&quot; dispersions
in galaxy clusters do increase with distance.</P>

about the 'big bang'?, by Werner Gitt, Creation Ex Nihilo 20(3):42-44,

<P><B>A Response to Dr. Hugh Ross by Masami Usami</B> <BR>
http://web.fou.telenor.no/fou/ttolge/mnvit/hayama/usami/usami.htm</P>

<P>It is a great privilege to be here to give my testimony and
respond to Dr. Ross' presentation.</P>

<P>First I want to tell a little about my own experience. I was
born into a Shinto family. In school I learned only evolutionary
thinking, so I was an evolutionist when I returned to Japan from
Sakhalin (Russia). My brother became a Christian and I was surprised.
I thought, &quot;There is no creator and we have traditional,
good religion, so why would my brother become a Christian?&quot;
I looked in my brother's Bible and read, &quot;In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth.&quot; I thought this was
an unscientific thought because I had learned that evolution is
science, and there is no creation. When I entered university I
thought that science was the only way to reach truth.</P>

<P>At the university I searched every book in every field of science
to find the answer to the Bible, to prove evolution. In the end,
what I learned was that there is no scientific basis for evolution.
There is only guess work, assumptions and circular reasoning.
So I came back to the Bible and after days of turmoil in my mind,
I trusted God and received Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord.</P>

<P>I agree with many arguments Dr. Ross provides in disproving
non-theistic evolution. Many of those arguments were developed
by young-earth creationists. Yet some of his ideas do not agree
with the Bible. Let us review his view of creation briefly.</P>

<P>1. God created the universe around 17 billion years ago, using
the Big Bang. Dr. Ross was so convinced of this theory that he
couldn't take the Bible literally. As a result, the rest of his
view had to follow the evolution time scale.</P>

<P>2. Creation days are not 6 literal 24 hour days, but billions
of years. The present age is the seventh day, which will continue
until the end of the age.</P>

<P>3. Death and bloodshed have existed from the beginning of creation
and is not the result of sin. Man was created after the vast majority
of earth's history of life and death had taken place.</P>

<P>4. The flood of Noah was local, not global, although it did
kill all humans outside the ark.</P>

<P>I certainly do not view these ideas as being Biblical. I believe
Biblical creation requires these beliefs: 1. God created the universe
several thousand years ago. Heaven and earth were created on the
first of the 6 creation days. 2. Everything was created in the
order mention in Genesis ch.1. These creation days are literal
and not long periods. The seventh day is as literal as the rest,
one 24-hour day. 3. Death and bloodshed were the result of Adam's
sin. 4. Noah's flood was global and killed all humans, land animals
and birds except those in the ark. Further, I believe such Biblical
creation to be essential to Biblical Christianity.</P>

<P>Concerning the Hebrew word &quot;Yom&quot; (day), Strong's
Concordance says, &quot;a day whether lit. (from sunrise to sunset,
or from one sunset to the next), or fig. (a space of time defined
by an associated term.)&quot; In Gen. 1 there is no associated
term to indicate a figurative meaning, so we must take it as literal.
In Ex. 20:8-11 Moses used the word in a very literal way. God
created for 6 days and rested 1, and thus did God sanctify the
seventh day and commanded the people to rest the seventh day.
He did not say to work 6 long ages and rest 1 long age. Anyhow,
God is not still resting; He is working. Jesus said, &quot;My
Father is working still, and I am working&quot; (Jn. 5:17). And
Paul said, &quot;God is at work in you, both to will and to work
for His good pleasure.&quot; God is certainly working, not resting.
The Bible says &quot;God rested.&quot; That is past tense. It
does not say, &quot;God started resting.&quot; Let's get it right.</P>

<P>If, indeed, those were long ages, all flowers that are pollinated
by insects and birds would have become extinct before insects
were created. It had to be a short period. Dr. Ross' teaching
that there was death before Adam sinned and that his sin resulted
only in spiritual death is old news. The heretic, Pelagius, taught
this around 400 A. D. The Pelagian view is that man was created
mortal. He taught everything about us dies sooner or later, so
it is and has always been with man. The principle of death and
decay is a part of the whole creation. Pelagius was rightly denounced
by the early church, for which we should be thankful. According
to Dr. Ross' beliefs, Jesus Christ would have eventually died
anyhow, even if He had not been crucified.</P>

<P>Does the Bible teach that natural creation was not affected
by Adam's sin? Not at all.</P>

<P>Romans 8:20-22. &quot;For the creation was subjected to futility,
not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because
the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of children of God. For we
know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs
together until now.&quot; Corruption includes death, part of the
futility to which creation was subjected, as in Gen. 3:17, &quot;Cursed
is the ground because of you. . . &quot;</P>

<P>I Cor. 15:21-22. &quot;For since by man came death, by Man
also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ all shall be made alive.&quot; The words show
that Adam's sin resulted in physical death as well as spiritual
death. We must not say Adam would have died physically, but not
spiritually, had he not sinned. The resurrection of Jesus Christ
was physical, not spiritual, so we know that Jesus died to redeem
our fleshly bodies, and not only our spirits.</P>

<P>What about Noah's flood? In Gen. 9:11, God said to Noah, &quot;Thus
I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh
be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there
be a flood to destroy the earth.&quot; If the flood was only local,
God did not keep His covenant, because there have been many floods
since that time, killing lots of people. If the flood was local,
why spend 90 years building an ark? Why not just move animals
and believers to higher ground? The language of the account, besides
passages like Psalm 104, require a global flood . . . destroying
&quot;all flesh&quot;.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross has many theories. Theories are not based upon absolute
truth, and so are not absolutes. Many people think that scientists
are completely unbiased and their theories based upon pure observation.
This is not true. Einstein said, &quot;But on principle, it is
quite wrong to try founding a theory on observable magnitudes
alone. In reality the very opposite happens. It is the theory
which decides what we can observe.&quot;</P>

<P>The Big Bang is no exception. Evolutionists have for a long
time presented &quot;proof&quot; of the Big Bang, only to have
their &quot;proof&quot; proven wrong. Their assumptions which
&quot;proved&quot; the Big Bang, turned out not to prove it after
all. This is what Einstein said, &quot;It is the theory which
decides what we can observe.&quot; The big bang theory is a belief,
not science.</P>

<P>Astronomer Halton Arp wrote in <I>&quot;Nature&quot;</I> magazine,
&quot;Cosmology is unique in science in that it is a very large
intellectual edifice based on very few facts.&quot; (Nature, Aug.
30, 1990 pp. 807-812). He means that cosmology is mainly constructed
of guesswork and imagination. Dr. Ross would have us believe his
edifice is nothing but fact. Dr. Arp says it has very little fact.
I have to wonder if Dr. Ross has just accepted the Big Bang blindly,
or if he knows the truth of the fragility of the theory and is
willingly misleading people.</P>

<P>We are witnessing the collapse of the theories of evolution.
The Big Bang hypothesis has largely changed, being modified into
the inflation theory. In viewing the history of the universe and
the earth, how can we really get to the truth? Since theories
are only guesses, what we need is an eyewitness. Here is a good
example of that fact. It is the case of Mr. Sakamoto and his family
who were murdered by members of Aum Shinrikyo. For 5 years the
police and Mr. Sakamoto's mother searched for the Sakamoto family.
All theories and ideas were futile. Finally one of the murderers
came forward and admitted the crime and showed the police where
the bodies were buried. How could he do that? He, committed the
crime; he was an eyewitness. Police theories would never have
found the truth. It is the same in creation. In the matter of
the theoretical Big Bang, who was there to witness it? It is only
an assumption of the past. The only possible Eyewitness is the
Creator. He really should be taken as seriously as the killer
of the Sakamoto family. The police accepted the words of the killer
and found the bodies. We might wonder why people will take the
words of a killer, but not the words of the Creator God. The Big
Bang is now a passing theory - or a passed theory. The cosmology
was greatly changed with the discovery of the &quot;great wall.&quot;
We have material that shows that the Big Bang and other cosmologies
depending on evolution are only guess work and assumptions. Truth
is usually in the minority rather than the majority. We see that
in the record of Noah. Noah believed God and built an ark to save
his family and himself. After the flood Noah and his family were
then in the majority. This is God's record of the event. We must
seek truth and receive God's Word, regardless of men's opinions.</P>

<P>Astronomers, and other leading scientists, are bringing devastating
evidence against the Big Bang. As I check the details of the Eyewitness's
report, I find it (the Bible) to be rational, with sufficient
evidence. For example, in the Genesis account, on day three the
earth dried up quickly, at least within one day. One very strong
evidence of that is taken from research done on polonium halos
in basement granite. The explanation is tedious, but please hear
it.</P>

<P>When radioactive material decays within a solid, the escaping
alpha particles burns or etches the record of that escape in that
material. In a solid, it is a sphere, but when sliced and examined,
it looks like a halo. There are three kinds of polonium halos:
Po 210 (half life 138 days), Po 214 (half life 0.000146 sec.)
and Po 218 (half life 3 1/2 min.) Since magma is not yet solid,
no radiometric halo can form in magma. This means that the Po
218, having a half-life of only 3 1/2 minutes, had to be in the
granite when it was formed. Therefore the granite must have been
formed within 3 minutes. These polonium isotopes are the daughter
products of Uranium, a radioactive material which decays through
a chain of elements, finally to lead. Along the chain of decay
it passes through the three stages of polonium mentioned above.
However, there are many instances where polonium halos have been
found with no uranium nearby, and no marks of uranium having been
present. The presence of these Po 218 halos independent of the
uranium decay chain is evidence that a primordial liquid cooled
and crystallized almost instantaneously to form the earth's granites.
This is in sharp disagreement with the evolutionary position which
states that the earth cooled down from a molten condition over
a long period of time. Polonium halos are mute evidence that the
earth's basement rocks were formed suddenly. There was no need
for long ages, not even one whole day.</P>

<P>In coalized wood Dr. Gentry found many specimens of polonium
in the presence of uranium, not apart from uranium as he did in
granite.</P>

<P>The Lord raises the question, &quot;Where were you when the
earth was formed?&quot; (Job 38:4-7). Was Dr. Ross, or any other
scientist, there when the earth was formed? No? Then they are
all guessing. Just guessing. It is absurd for men to make dogmatic
statements about how things were billions of years ago. Even many
Christians swallow such atheism-based nonsense. Evolutionists
begin with an a priori assumption of long ages uniformitarianism,
renounce young earth creationists as unscientific, devise some
plausible explanation, and then point out that the present condition
agrees with their explanation. Sadly, they do not understand that
they are guilty of circular reasoning. God, the Creator Himself,
was the Eyewitness. Only God was there, and He, alone, knows what
happened. Fortunately for us, He gave us a record of what happened.
Unfortunately, men like Dr. Ross choose not to believe it. Carbon
14 is well known for age dating. Its weakness is that it can only
date things up to several thousand years old. So other methods
were developed. The potassium to argon decay test has been widely
touted as the most accurate dealing with long ages. The problem
is that no one knows that the universe is as old as dates given
by this method. Some tests on known ages of rocks show that this
method cannot be trusted at all. Consider some Hawaiian lava rocks.</P>

<P>The Journal of Geophysical Research, volume 73, July 15, 1968,
reported that lava rocks formed in 1800 and 1801 in Hawaii were
dated by a potassium-argon method and showed an age of formation
of 160 million years to 3 billion years. This shows a tremendous
discrepancy between the actual age and the age as determined by
a radiometric dating method. Another example of erroneous dating
is reported in Science, volume 162, October 11, 1968. Volcanic
rocks known to be less than 200 years old were dated by a radiometric
dating method and showed ages of 12 to 21 million years, showing
that the reliability of these dating methods is in question when
tested against materials with a known origin. We must remember
that these same dating techniques are one scientists believe give
a positive proof of the earth being billions of years old. The
following is a list of lava rock samples known to be less than
200 years old, showing the test results using the potassium-argon
method.</P>

<P>1. 160,000,000 years <BR>
2. 791,000,000 years <BR>
3. 960,000,000 years <BR>
4. 1,500,000,000 years <BR>
5. 1,580,000,000 years <BR>
6. 2,040,000,000 years <BR>
7. 2,470,000,000 years <BR>
8. 2,960,000,000 years</P>

<P>Would you rest your faith in the age of the earth upon such
methods rather than the revealed word of God?</P>

<P>It is objected that recently formed rocks give erroneous dates.
How do they know that any rocks give correct dates? About 90%
of all radiometric dating tests are thrown out because they do
not give the &quot;correct&quot; dates according to the theory
of evolution. If the dates of these rocks were not known they
would adopt a method of averaging the dates, and accept the dates
as being valid. The Grand Canyon is often given as great proof
of evolution and long ages. The evidence is otherwise. The eruption
of Mt. St. Helens and the subsequent events give us some very
important data relative to the formation of canyons. At the time
of the eruption the river was dammed up creating a large lake.
About three years later there was a smaller eruption creating
a mud flow which burst the dam on the river. Down river sediment
from the eruption had been washed in and settled out. After three
years it was all settled and began to harden. However, when the
dam burst, a path was quickly cut through this relatively new
sediment. The result of this was to create what some call a &quot;mini
Grand Canyon&quot; (about 1/40 the size of the Grand Canyon).
Many features look remarkably like the Grand Canyon. So much so
that some scientists are questioning the necessity of long ages
to create the Grand Canyon. How long did it take to cut the mini
Grand Canyon? About three hours. Probably a few days to a few
weeks would have been enough to cut out the Grand Canyon had there
been a similar situation. There is strong evidence that such a
condition did exist.</P>

<P>If you will look at Appendix II you will see that Dr. Ross'
model is almost identical to that of atheistic evolution and theistic
evolution, except he has God involved just a bit more than theistic
evolutionists. I return to the matter of the revelation of an
eyewitness.</P>

<P>1. The record must be clear, objective and easily understood.
In Genesis the Eyewitness did not show us everything about the
universe, but what is written is true.</P>

<P>2. The testimony must be such that it can be verified.</P>

<P>3. If symbols are used the text or context will show clearly
that it is symbolic. We must not add to the Record.</P>

<P>Throughout history, people misunderstood and believed contemporary
science to be truth, as Dr. Ross does. However, science is and
has always been biased by the dominating philosophy or world view
of the time. When those views changed, so did the scientific theories.</P>

<P>Before Magellan people thought the Bible taught the earth was
flat. The church at that time was strongly influenced by Greek
and Roman philosophy. So, it was not the Bible that taught the
earth was flat, but the dominating philosophy of the time. The
Bible, in fact, teaches the earth is a sphere. Pro. 8:27, Isaiah
40:22. The church also took up the philosophy of geocentricism
from Plato and Aristotle. We still suffer from that mistake. Christianity
has suffered much damage from teaching as Bible the philosophies
of the world. Every time the church falls for some world philosophy
we get hurt. We can, we must avoid this today.</P>

<P>Look at other wrong ideas in the past. 1. Ptolemy. In Almagest
he wrote &quot;the earth was the center of the universe and not
moveable.&quot; Intellectuals of the time accepted this explanation
until Copernicus. The Roman Catholic Church compromised with this
view, making it Catholic dogma. When Galileo rejected this view,
the church court labeled him a heretic, but he insisted he said
nothing different to that in the Bible. (See &quot;Conflict Between
Science and Religion&quot; by White.) In Job 38:12-15 the earth's
rotation is mentioned.</P>

<P>2. Linneus. When Linneus classified living things the secular
mind misled the church. Creatures were classified by phyla, family,
genera, species and other taxinomical units, and species were
identified as a &quot;kind&quot; as written in Genesis ch. 1.
So he taught that each species is fixed and has not changed since
creation. The Anglican Church accepted this view and it became
church dogma. Darwin learned this at Cambridge University. When
he went to the Galapagos Islands he found variations from island
to island. He concluded the various forms came from a common ancestor.
Following this thought, he assumed that given enough time amoeba
could become humans. Now we know that what Darwin saw was only
a minor variation which some call, &quot;micro evolution.&quot;
Genesis ch. 1 says all life was created &quot;after it kind.&quot;
There is variation within the kind, not real evolution.</P>

<P>3. Darwin. When Darwin's view was popularized, many Christians
compromised with this view. This world view has become the last
religion for the final age of the world. Now the Big Bang theory
is collapsing as is shown by many scientists. Sir Fred Hoyle,
a famous astrophysicist, has renounced it. He says if there were
a Big Bang, there would be a quantity of hydrogen, a little helium
and a smattering of a few other gases, and after that, &quot;a
dull-as-ditch water expansion.&quot; Of course, if there had been
such an explosion, the matter would still be speeding through
space, and there is no law in physics that can produce stars and
planets out of that. We should not let Dr. Ross, or anyone else,
deceive us by assuring us he knows what is happening hundreds
of light years away.</P>

<P>Dr. Ross gives a very impressive presentation and if we do
not hold strongly to the Word of God we may be deceived. II Cor.
11:13-15 gives a timely warning for our day. &quot;For such men
are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as
apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light. So it is not strange if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will
correspond to their deeds.&quot; Brothers and Sisters, although
this is hard to say, I beg you to hear it. Dr. Ross is doing the
work of Satan.</P>

<P>The Big Bang is in the future, not in the past! &quot;But the
heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word,
are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition
of ungodly men&quot; (II Peter 3:7).</P>

<P>Even if we cannot find all the answers to scientific questions,
we should not accept ideas different to the clear teachings of
the Bible. We need to wait until science catches up to the Bible.
Hear the words of II Timothy 3:16-17.</P>

<P>&quot;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly
equipped for every good work.&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Ross says that his presentation is very effective in reaching
people with the Gospel, but that young earth creationists are
not effective. We have found in our church that as we present
the Gospel from the standpoint of a young earth, Biblical, direct
creation, people are convinced and trust Jesus and follow Him.
In our church about 65% of the members have been reached through
young earth, Biblical creation. We do not need to compromise to
preach the Gospel...</P>

<P>In closing I give a quote from Josh McDowell. &quot;The message
of the Bible is clear for those who will read it and seek to find
out its meaning. The problem comes when people bring their preconceived
notions to the Bible and attempt to make the Word fit their ideas.
This is not the fault of the Bible, but of the persons who force
the Bible to say what they want it to say.&quot; (Creation and
Time by Van Bebber/Taylor, p. 58).</P>

<P>I will be praying for your confrontation with Hugh Ross. He
needs to meet Jesus. Perhaps, since his &quot;conversion&quot;
he has been surrounded by too many Pharisees who &quot;err, not
knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.&quot; May the Lord
give you great wisdom to season your words with salt, prophetic
power to draw attention to God rather than you, and a heart of
compassion for his soul. In some ways Mr. Ross is worse than a
Simon the sorcerer for the huge impact of deception he has made
on the Christian church at large. On the other hand, it could
very well be in God's providence that Mr. Ross is simply a fulfillment
of God's principle in 2 Thes. 2:10b-12. I'll be praying that God
will fill you with His Spirit and mighty weapons to pull down
strongholds and bring every thought captive to the obedience of
Christ.</P>

<P>Henry Morris- <BR>
Many atheistic astronomers do not believe in big bang. <BR>
Hugh says new species is new creation <BR>
Romans 5 and I Cor 15 death by sin. <BR>
Would Adam have died anyway if he had not sinned? <BR>
Why did Christ die physically not just spiritually?</P>

<P>Ray Comfort- tell me what you think a person needs to do to
be saved. <BR>
What is sin? Act 28:23 jump to law w/o offense. Law speaks to
man's intellect and then his conscience by the law. <BR>
Make it personal, &quot;I had an intellectual knowledge but had
not come through the right door. By the law is the knowledge of
sin.&quot; Romans 3:20. Rom. 7:7 &quot;Nay, I had not known sin,
but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said,
Thou shalt not covet.&quot; <BR>
Like rich young ruler. Keeps the moral part of the law- man to
man but not right relation with God.</P>

<P>I called Duane Gish to ask his advice on the upcoming Hugh
Ross debate. Here are his comments: <BR>
Tell the audience that Hugh accepts the Big Bang created to get
God out. -produced hydrogen and helium- all stars, planets, man
came from this gas- <B>&quot;We are the burnt out embers of hydrogen
gas.&quot;</B> &quot;Anybody with a good pair of binoculars can
run outside and see stars forming.&quot; Hugh said to Duane Gish.
Matter is moving outward from this area. <B>&quot;The physics
of star formation is more simple that raindrop formation.&quot;</B>
This is absurd! Gravitational force is less than gas pressure
pushing out by 50 to 1. &quot;Some scientists have established
that there are 10 dimensions.&quot; &quot;10 x -103&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;4th day stars became visible.&quot; No! they were created!
<BR>
&quot;All the lights went on at the same time.&quot; Why would
this be?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I just couldn't sleep at night regarding your Creation debate
with Hugh Ross. I thought I had addressed everything. Then I woke
up with a few more important points for you.</P>

<P>1. Hugh Ross insists that the sun existed from day one of creation
week. But the Bible says that God created light on Day One then
created separate lights on day four (sun, moon, stars). If Hugh
Ross is right then the light God created in Day One lighting up
the earth is redundant. This is further complicated by the fact
that God divided the light from the darkness, just as he divided
the land from the water. He is fully capable of doing this without
even the existence of the sun, moon or stars. He did not created
the sun, moon, and stars to DIVIDE the light from darkness but
rather to GOVERN the days, years and seasons. The light God created
was on the earth, it did not need to shine through the clouds
to get it there. Hugh Ross theology would require two DIFFERENT
light sources for Day one and forward.</P>

<P>2. More on Hugh Ross's statement of NO alteration of the physics
on the earth. How about Moses turning the wooden rod into a living
snake miracle?</P>

<P>3. Hugh Ross quotes Lev 25 that the Sabbath Year is a parable.
But even if this were true, in a parable or analogy, you are comparing
something to a known reference point. In this case the comparison
is to a day or Sabbath Day, meaning the reader must understand
what a day is in order to even be able to make the comparison.
But according to Hugh Ross, you can't know what a day is or its
duration. So, my question for Hugh Ross is WHEN DOES A DAY BECOME
A DAY AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IT? IF YOU DON'T WHAT A DAY IS, THEN
HOW WILL YOU KNOW WHAT A YEAR IS? HUGH ROSS IS BASICALLY SAYING
THAT GOD IS TELLING MAN THAT HE HAS NO WAY OF TELLING TIME. God
gives the sun, moon and stars to govern time for man, and to know
how long to work (6 days), how long to rest (Sabbath Day), when
to start work again (First Day) of the next week cycle, while
simultaneously telling man he has no way of determining the length
of a day in order to obey God's commands? This is most unfortunate
for the Jews who must perform a daily sacrifice and evening oblation
without a clue when to do it. Too bad for Daniel in his prayer
to the Lord inquiring about the end of 70 years of captivity prophesied
by Jeremiah who would have no ability whatsoever to determine
the length of a year, let alone 70 years. God issues this curse
through Moses then leaves his people clueless what a year is.
Daniel predicts the number of years until the Messiah is cut off.
Why would God do this if Daniel had no idea what a year was? (Remember
you can't know what a year is if you don't know what a day is!)
Too bad for the Jews in Egypt who were to come out of Egypt in
the number of years given to Abraham but not know what a year
is? Poor Ezekiel who must lie on his side a day for a year without
a clue how long a day is? Jesus Christ expected his people to
know the day of his visitation. He further tells them that he
will be in the grave three days and three nights. But since a
day can be any duration, he could be there for 3 million years
and no one could ever challenge his resurrection. No one could
ever know the difference.</P>

<P>It is amazing to me that Hugh Ross states that there is no
way to tell time on the earth because we don't know what a day
is or how long it is, yet he insists that we can measure time
in the Universe in order to determine when the Big Bang Occurred,
when time began. How is it possible to measure time in his universe
while it is simultaneously impossible to measure it on the earth?
We know what a day is in the Universe, but do not know what a
day is on the earth? How more contradictory can you get?</P>

<P>Hugh Ross further maintains that he knows the time it took
starlight to get to the earth. But time space and matter were
created at the same time. Therefore the light from the stars is
not bound by time in God's creative act outside of time. (Remember
God can work outside of time even after He created and began time.
If Adam, created only 2 days later is expected to see the light
from the stars, then God did not create the stars, then expect
Adam to wait for the light to get there. If the light from the
stars is the prisoner of time then light from them still would
not have arrived so that we could see it if each Creation day
is even 1,000 years in duration.</P>

<P>4. If Noah's Flood according to Hugh Ross is LOCAL then the
curse is LOCAL. We should then all move to Antarctica to join
Hugh Ross' penguins and the rest of mankind that escaped Noah's
Flood...the reset of Adams' descendants that are not descendants
of Ham, Shem or Japheth, so that we too can live in Paradise (everywhere
outside of Mesopotamia) where the whole earth does not groan for
Christ's return.</P>
