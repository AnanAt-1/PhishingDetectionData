          <dt>Some of our encryption products are export controlled items and are regulated by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Some are classified as mass market encryption devices and may not be exported or shipped for re-export to restricted countries in Country Group E:1. They are exportable to most other countries.

          <dt>Radio installers rely on DCB tunnel products to implement secure networks for mission critical applications. DCB Encryptors (XT, UT, and ET roducts) enable IP dispatching across multiple networks.  They remove the multi-cast problem faced in many IP network installations so are frequently used along with Telex, Motorola, Kenwood, Harris, Zetron, AVTEC, and other two-way radio consoles. This document describes some of those techniques with examples we've seen at PSAPs and other dispatch centers.</dt>
  <dt><br></dt> <dt><a href="/notes/xt%20product%20security.pdf">Tunnel  Product Security In Perspective.</a></dt>
          <dt>Our encrypted tunnel appliances provides a LAN -to- LAN encrypted tunnel between locations. It employs a layer three (UDP/IP or TCP/IP) connection between two or more tunnel devices to create a secure, AES encrypted tunnel. For export purposes, the Some models are considered a Mass Market Encryption Device by the Department of State Bureau of Industrial Security and are export limited. 
		  </p><p>
		  This product line meets HIPPA and most government standards for non-classified data transfer. However, it is not NIST FIPS 140-2 approved. For a FIPS 140 approved product, the (more expensive) FT line of encryption appliances is required.  This note discusses the security implications of using our encrypted tunnels.

          <dt>Users have come to rely on DCB tunnel products to implement secure networks for mission critical applications in which downtime must be kept to a minimum. Thus it is not unusual for customers to ask questions about techniques that may be applied to make the tunnel network more robust.

            <dt>The most commonly used wide area networking technology for
            SCADA systems is the venerable leased line and multi-drop modem.
            The infrastructure required to support this technology is fast
            becoming excessively costly as telephone carriers migrate to
            packet switched technology solutions. Current SCADA systems can

            deployment of new RTU and host equipment by using Frame Relay
            FRADS designed to support legacy SCADA protocols. This paper
            discusses the economics, practicality, and reliability of
            commercial Frame Relay networking for SCADA systems. Originally

            (such as a laptop)using ppp, and with the proliferation of

          - How Much Bandwidth is really needed? </a></dt>
          <dt>SCADA applications over Frame Relay require very little
          bandwidth. So why would we even bring up the discussion about
          bandwidth when using our BPF (a SCADA FRAD communications device)
          for SCADA over Frame Relay? Because the issue comes up every single
          time a customer installs a system.<br>
          <a href="/notes/0104scadabandwidth.html">Here are the facts.

          T-3, etc.?</a></dt>
          <dt>After reading our T1 white paper, a number of customers asked
          us "Where'd the "T" come from in T-1, T-3, etc.? There are many
          stories floating around (such as T=Time, T= Transmission,
          T=Terrestrial, Just the next letter in sequence, etc.). We thought
          the best place to get the true story would be from someone who
          helped develop this technology. So, we asked our fiend Dr John
          Pan.<br>

          Devices</a></dt>
          <dt>Most CDPD modems are designed to connect to remote devices
          (such as a laptop)using ppp, and with the proliferation of
          ethernet-enabled remote devices, a method is needed to connect the
          serial RS-232 CDPD modem to one or more ethernet-enabled RTU
          devices at remote sites along with serial devices. The DCB IP-5200
          micro-router application described in this paper is an example of
          this technology in use. Along with the IP-5200, an EtherPath
          ethernet to serial converter may be used for direct access to
          serial devices. <a href="/notes/0101rtu.html">Read the
