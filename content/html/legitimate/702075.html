If your choice is the inner data, do  not overwrite this card and find solutions to rescue data back latter. But, if  you want to rescue both of your data and remained files, ok, just act  carefully: take back SD card data back with RAW SD card data recovery software  at first and format this card for <a href="convert-raw-file-system-into-ntfs.html" title="convert raw to ntfs">converting RAW file system back to NTFS</a> or  FAT 32 afterwards. Just search for a data recovery tool online to help you out. </p>
<h3>RAW File System SD Card Data Recovery</h3>
<p>Many SD card RAW file system programs are  promoted over the internet. So, it is not hard for you to select one. But, in  order to increase the chances of preface data recovery, you should take some  efforts to land powerful SD card data recovery software. <br />
Here are common steps for you to rescue RAW  SD card data back: 
<p><b>Step 1:</b
>                    
<p>Connect this RAW card to your computer and  Download this card data recovery software from its official website. 
<div class="support_guide_img"><img src="../img/howto/1-select.png" width="500" height="326" alt="main screen shot" />
<p>Select recovery options in the main interface</p>
</div>
					<p><b>Step 2:</b> </p>
					<p>Launch this tool and choose a data recovery mode for your RAW file  system problem. (With its user-friendly interface, you always can know the  major functions of every data recovery mode simply from their names.)  </p>
<div class="support_guide_img"><img src="../img/howto/2-partition.png" width="500" height="325" alt="select card" /><p>Select card to search photos off card </p>
</div>
						<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
						<p>Mark out all needed data to restore after  the thorough scan. (In order to save your time, this freeware allows you to  directly mark out the useful data alone for restoring.)</p>
<div class="support_guide_img"><img src="../img/howto/3-wait-while-scanning.png" width="500" height="325" alt="wait for photo searching" />
<p>Wait while scanning lost photos, sometimes it takes about 20 minutes to scan a 32G card.</p>
                        <p>Tips: if it takes more than 2 hours to scan a 32GB card, you may stop the scanning and wait to see <br />what's already found. Since the card may contains bad blocks that takes longer time than usual.</p>
</div>
						<p><b>Step 4:</b><br />
					    Recover all data and save it on another  card or drive in case of data recovery failure. (Its &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; feature also  allows you to check whether all your data is retrieved rightly.)  </p>
<div class="support_guide_img">
<p><img src="../img/howto/4-recover.png" width="500" height="326" alt="restore lost photos" /></p>
						  <p>Preview lost photos and save found files. It would generate a folder to contain your lost data. <br />Please do not save the photo to the card where you lost them. Save them to your PC drive!</p>

                  <h3>Warnings: </h3>
                  <p>(1). Avoid adding new files on this <a href="data-recovery-from-raw-memory-card.html" title="raw memory card data recovery">RAW  memory card</a> before all needed files are restored.<br />
                    (2). Avoid saving restored data on this RAW  memory card in case that it is lost again for the following formatting  process.  <br />
                    (3). Avoid remaining all important card  data on this memory card only in the future.  </p>
<h3>Fix RAW File System Problem  </h3>
                    <p>RAW file system often can be easily fixed  by formatting process. Why? Clearly speaking, the formatting process often can  help convert RAW file system back to previous functional file system, like NTFS  or FAST32. In this technological era, unlike other converting operations that  need to be accomplished with the help of a special converting program, such as  Photo converting programs, video converting programs and more, the RAW file  system converting operation is really simply. What you should do is merely to  format this RAW hard drive/memory card and then, your computer will do the  following things for you. </p>
<h3>Common Symptoms of RAW File System Problems</h3>
<p>Do you know that there many common symptoms  that can help you land a RAW file system problem? If you do not know, just read  them below: <br />
  (1).The most typical symptom is that the  computer Windows will display a popping-out error message saying: &ldquo;The disk is  not formatted. Do you want to format it now?&rdquo;<br />
  (2).The most obvious symptom is that the  previous &ldquo;NTFS&rdquo; or &ldquo;FAT32&rdquo;  file system will be changed into &ldquo;RAW&rdquo; in &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; or &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;.<br />
  (3).The strangest symptom is that your used  space and free space of memory card capacity will also be displayed as 0 bytes  in &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. </p>
<h3>Famous Memory Card Brand </h3>
<p>Do you know that there are many different famous memory card brands on  the market? In fact, when trying to choose a proper memory card for our  camcorder/phone/camera/music players, sometimes, we will also take the brands  into considerations. That’s also why you should know something about the famous  memory card brands. Actually, as I know, there are many reliable memory card  brands that are worth trying, like Samsung, Sony, Kingston, Toshiba, SanDisk, PNY, Centon and  more.
