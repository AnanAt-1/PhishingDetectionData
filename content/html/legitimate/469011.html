Introduction 

Penhallow's  History  of  the  Indian  Wars  is  one 
of  the  rarest  books  of  its  class.  When  it  first 
appeared  it  doubtless  was  read  by  some  who 
may  have  been  able  to  recall  the  setting  up  of 
the  first  printing  press  in  New  England;  to 
most  of  its  early  readers  the  impressions  of  that 
first  press  were  familiar  objects.  Though  we 
may  thus  associate  the  book  with  the  earliest 
of  New  England  imprints,  its  age  alone  does 
not  account  for  the  scarcity  of  surviving  copies, 
for  many  older  books  are  more  common.  Its 
disappearance  seems  better  explained  by  the 
fact  that  matters  concerning  the  Indians  were, 
excepting  possibly  religious  controversies,  of  the 
greatest  interest  to  the  readers  of  that  time  and 
that  such  books  as  these  were  literally  read  to 
pieces;  they  were  issued  moreover  in  only  small 
editions  for  relatively  few  readers,  as  there  were 
probably  not  175,000  people  in  the  New  England 
Colonies  in  1726. 

Here,  moreover,  the  facilities  for  the  preserva- 
tion of  printed  matter  were  in  general  poor;  too 
often  in  the  outlying  settlements  the  leaky  cup- 
board was  the  library  and  the  hearth  with  its 
flickering  pine  knot  was  the  study.  At  the 
writer's  elbow  lies  a  copy  of  Penhallow's  rare 
History,   the  mutilated   survivor  of  a  fireplace

accident.  The  reader  of  long  ago,  tiring  of 
the  story  of  the  atrocities  of  the  red  Indian, 
or  the  white  man,  fell  asleep  and  dropped  the 
book  beside  him.  A  live  coal  now  fell  upon 
the  little  volum.e  and,  beginning  in  the  very 
center  of  the  cover,  burned  through  the  first 
thirty  pages,  when  presumably,  the  fumes  of 
burning  leather  awoke  J.  Hempsted,  or  the 
reader  of  ''J.  Hempsted,  His  Book,  1728.'' 

To  the  New  England  colonist  the  depreda- 
tions of  his  Indian  neighbors  were  of  literally 
vital  interest.  The  pioneer  in  the  new  settle- 
ments de-forested  his  land,  tilled  his  fields,  gath- 
ered his  harvest  and,  on  the  Lord's  Day,  walked 
to  his  meeting-house,  at  all  times  armed  with 
his  flint-lock  for  self  defence  against  the  native 
whom  he  had  armed  at  a  sinister  profit  with 
musket,  powder  and  lead.  When  at  last,  Anglo- 
Saxon  determination  had  conquered  and  the  In- 
dian was  eliminated  from  the  problem  of  pion- 
eer existence,  the  growing  generation  of  New 
England  boys  and  girls  read  into  fragments  the 
''Narratives,"  ''Captivities"  and  "Histories"  of 
those  of  their  forebears  who  providentially  had 
escaped  the  enemy,  or  redeem.ed  after  "capti- 
vation"  had  lived  to  print  the  tale. 

Never  before  the  colonization  of  America  had 
the  English  come  into  continued  and  intimate 
contact  with  savages  and  in  the  contest  for 
suprem.acy  that  followed,  they  were  but  poorly 
prepared  with  their  incomprehension  of  primi- 
tive society  and  their  ill-conceived  policies  of 
fanatical  proselytism.  On  the  other  hand  the 
Indian  of  the  Al  tan  tic  coast  had  experienced  little 


INTRODUCTION.  in 

in  his  acquaintance  with  the  early  explorers, 
English  or  others ,  that  had  prejudiced  him  fav- 
orably toward  white  men.  These  had  kidnapped 
him  to  exhibit  him  as  a  curiosity  in  Europe  or 
to  sell  him  into  slavery;  they  had  shot  him  in 
little  else  than  wantonness  or  for  petty  thiev- 
ery. When  colonization  began  and  the  Indian 
himself  had  furnished  the  valuable  food-plant 
without  which  permanent  settlements  at  that 
time  would  probably  have  failed,  he  saw  his 
own  planting  places  overrun  by  cattle,  his  game 
driven  away,  his  fisheries  ruined  by  mills  and 
mill-dams,  his  people  destroyed  by  the  firearms, 
diseases,  vices,  fire-water,  indeed  by  the  very 
religion  of  the  whites.  He  was  human.  Natur- 
ally enough,  before  he  was  overwhelmed,  he  de- 
vastated outl&gt;ang  settlements  and  decimated  the 
colonists;  during  the  half  century  preceding  the 
publication  of  this  History,  more  than  eight 
thousand  New  England  settlers  lost  their  lives 
and  few  families  there  were  who  mourned  no 
relative  or  friend.  In  such  a  community  the 
interest   in    Indian   affairs   was   predominant. 

A  specific  instance  of  this  interest  is  seen  in 
the  practice  of  making  Indian  affairs  the  chief 
topic  in  the  published  serm.on — the  newspaper 
of  that  day.  Whatever  the  occasion,  this  dis- 
course afforded  the  opportunity  for  publishing, 
with  appropriate  comments,  the  latest  news  of 
important  events — conflagrations,  m^arine  dis- 
asters, earthquakes  and  the  always  important 
accounts  of  depredations  and  massacres  in  the 
frontier  settlements.  Our  author,  for  instance, 
acknowledges  his  indebtedness  for  the  latest  de-

tails  in  his  narrative  of  LovewelFs  fight  (p. 115) 
to  such  a  sermon  by  the  ''ingenious  Mr.  Synames." 
He,  the  minister  at  Bradford,  seems  to  have 
secured,  by  reason  of  his  proximity  to  the  scene 
of  that  memorable  encounter,  ''exclusive  informa- 
tion" as  it  would  be  called  in  modern  journal- 
istic speech  and  to  have  hastened  its  early  pub- 
lication. 

Aside  from  all  this,  Penhallow's  Indian  Wars 
seems  to  have  been  predestined  to  become  a 
scarce  book.  Its  author  was  a  public  man  and 
perhaps  the  best  known  officer  of  New  Hamp- 
shire. The  various  brief  biographical  sketches 
of  him  in  books  of  reference  are  chiefly  abstracts 
from  Nathaniel  Adams'  Memoir,  prefixed  to  the 
Reprint  of  the  Indian  Wars  in  the  Collections 
of  the  New  Hampshire  Historical  Societ^^,  Vol. 
I,  pp.  9-13. 

Samuel  Penhallow  was  born  in  St.  Mabon, 
Cornwall,  England,  July  2,  1665.  In  his  youth 
he  was  a  student  in  the  school  of  the  silenced 
dissenting  minister,  Charles  Morton,  at  New- 
ington-Green  and  with  Morton,  in  1686,  he  came 
to  New  England.  It  is  circumstantially  stated 
that  in  leaving  England,  Penhallow  had  in  mind 
a  continuation  of  his  studies  under  Morton,  and, 
finally,  a  preparation  for  missionary  labors  amxong 
the  Indians,  but  his  biographer  does  not  seem 
to  have  known  that  his  entrance  into  Harvard 
College  was  contemplated.  This  we  learn  from 
a  note  that  some  former  owner  of  the  Field 
copy  laid  into  that  book.  It  recites  that  the 
Rev.  Increase  Mather,  President  of  Harvard, 
received  in  1685  a  letter  from  his  brother  Na- 


INTRODUCTION.  v 

thaniel,  written  "in  behalf  of  this  gentleman,  ye 
bearer  his  kinsman,  Mr.  Penhallow  of  Falmouth, 
in  Cornwall,  who  designs  to  spend  a  year  or 
two  in  New  England,  in  your  colledge,  for  ye 
prfecting  his  learning."  (Field  Catalogue,  p.255.) 
With  Morton,  he  remained  some  time  in  Charles- 
town,  but  we  hear  no  more  of  his  preparation 
for  missionary  labors.  The  political  troubles 
about  that  time  are  alleged  as  the  cause  of  his 
discouragment. 

He  next  removed  to  Portsmouth,  New  Hamp- 
shire, where  he  began  a  prosperous  career  in 
business  and  poHtical  life.  Here  he  m^arried  a 
wealthy  heiress,  Mary,  the  daughter  of  President 
Cutt,  part  of  whose  patrimony  was  valuable 
land  in  Portsmouth.  He  accumulated  what  in 
those  times  was  described  as  a  great  estate, 
but  many  details  of  his  life  have  been  lost  owing 
in  part  to  the  destruction  of  his  diary  m  the 
great  fire  of  1802.  He  was  elected  the  Speaker 
of  the  House,  August  7,  1699,  and  held  office 
for  three  years.  From  1702  to  the  time  of  his 
death,  he  was  an  influential  member  of  the 
Royal  Council,  holding  concurrently  the  offices 
of  Treasurer  of  the  Provmce  and  of  Recorder 
of  Deeds.  As  Councilor,  he  won  popular  ap- 
plause through  his  controversy  with  Lieut.-Gov- 
emor  George  Vaughan.  At  that  time  he  was 
suspended  by  Vaughan,  who  was  himself  soon 
removed  from  office  by  Samuel  Shute,  the  Colo- 
nial Governor  of  Massachusetts  and  New  Hamp- 
shire. Penhallow  resumed  his  place  and  by  vir- 
tue of  his  office,  took  part  in  the  ratification  of 
the  treaties  with  the  Indians,  of  which  he  has 


vi  INTRODUCTION. 

given  us  a  descripticn  in  this  history.  He  was 
appointed  to  the  Superior  Court  of  Judicature 
in  1714;  of  this  Court  he  was  Chief -justice  when 
he  died  December  2,  1726. 

He  is  said  to  have  Hved  in  a  style  superior 
to  that  of  most  of  his  fellow  townsmen  in  his 
brick  house  at  the  head  of  the  pier,  entertain- 
ing every  stranger  of  distinction.  His  biographer 
thus  describes  him  as  '* given  to  hospitality/' 
wherefore  the  following  Order,  found  in  the  Pro- 
vincial Papers  of  New  Hampshire  may  be  of 
interest,  bearing  as  it  does  upon  the  am.enities 
of  official  life  two  centuries  ago.  This  directs 
that: 


"Mr.  Treasurer  Penhallow  take  care  to  provide  for  the 
Gentlemen  Commrs  .  .  .  who  are  going-  to  Casco  fort  to  the 
Eastward  to  publish  the  Articles  of  Ratification  of  peace 
with  the  Indians,  with  all  such  provisions,  wines.  Liquors 
and  other  necessaries  as  may  be  proper  ..."    [July  14, 1713.] 


Of  thirteen  children,  one  son.  Captain  John 
Penhallow  was  an  early  proprietor  of  Phipsburg 
(Georgetown,)  Maine,  Governor  of  Arrowsick 
and  a  prominent  officer  of  the  militia  under 
Col.  Thomas  Westbrook. 

Our  author's  prominence  in  official  and  busi- 
ness life  must  have  stimulated  his  attention  to 
the  Indian  affairs  of  his  time  and  the  resulting 
personal  familiarity  with  his  subject  is  perhaps 
his  strongest  claim  to  authority  as  a  writer  of 
his  book.  In  the  pubHcation  of  this  work,  he 
secured  a  sponsor,  if  that  was  needful,  in  one  of 
the  most  popular  of  Boston  ministers.  Dr.  Ben- 
jamin Colman,  of  the  Brattle  Street  Church. 


INTRODUCTION.  vii 

Dr.  Colman  looms  larger  in  the  enterprise,  than 
at  first  appears;  he  ends  his  Preface  after  the 
manner  of  his  profession  with  the  moral  that 
the  tale  should  teach^  having  begun  it  by  group- 
ing the  historians  of  New  England  into  two 
classes,  ''honest  and  worthy  Persons  and  some 
learned" — an  allusion  now  obscure,  but  as  he  speci- 
fically mentions  another  Indian  history,  the 
Decennium  Luctuosum,  by  the  Rev.  Cotton 
Mather — so  often  designated  as  the  ''learned" 
Dr.  Mather, — we  may  suspect  that  he  had  in 
mind  some  attribute  of  his  clerical  contemporary. 
Time  may  have  softened  many  of  the  asperities 
of  professional  life  in  the  Boston  of  thirteen 
thousand  inhabitants.  Dr.  Colman  was  at  the 
height  of  his  popularity;  he  had  declined  the 
presidency  of  Harv^ard  College  and  had  published 
twenty-five  of  the  fifty  printed  sermons  Hsted  by 
Thomas  Prince. 

The  success  of  our  author's  first — and  last — 
literary  venture  may  have  been  promoted  like- 
wise by  the  reputation  of  his  pubhshers,  Samuel 
Gerrish  and  Col.  Daniel  Henchman,  asso- 
ciated in  the  venture  as  was  common  practice 
of  the  time.  Samuel  Gerrish  began  his  business 
in  1704.  He  was  a  member  of  a  prominent 
family,  a  son-in-law  of  Samuel  Sewall  and  a 
successful  publisher.  More  than  fifty  books  by 
well-known  writers  of  the  day  bear  his  imprint. 
The  last  is  the  Chronological  History  (1736',  by 
Thomas  Prince.  The  first  catalogue  of  books 
to  be  sold  by  auction,  so  far  as  known,  in  this 
country  (1717)  was  published  by  him  and  so 
likewise  the  first  music-book.     Bibliographically 


viii  INTRODUCTION. 

his  imprints  are  interesting:  "at  his  Shop  in 
Cornhill/'  ''at  the  Sign  of  the  Buck  over  against 
the  South  Meeting  House''  (1711),  ''lower  end 
of  Cornhill,"  "near  the  Old  Meeting  House" 
(1707),  "near  the  Brick  Meeting  House,"  "over 
against  the  North  side  of  the  Town  House  in 
King  Street"  (1714).  In  1712  he  was  made 
Fourth  Sergeant  of  the  Artillery  Company  which 
he  had  joined  in  1709;  he  was  a  prominent  mem- 
ber of  the  Old  South  Church,  for  several  years 
the  Register  of  Deeds  of  Suffolk  County  and 
for  seven  years  after  1733,  the  Town  Clerk  of 
Boston. 

The  other  pubHsher,  Colonel  Daniel  Hench- 
man, the  most  eminent  Boston  bookseller  of 
his  time  opened  shop,  on  the  south  corner  of 
State  and  Washington  Streets,  in  1713.  To  him 
the  Penhallow  book  must  have  seemed  a  small 
affair  indeed,  for  that  year  with  Benjamm  Eliot, 
he  was  pubHshing  in  folio,  the  largest  book 
printed  till  then  in  Boston.  This,  A  Compleat 
Body  of  Divinity,  by  the  "Reverend  and  Learned 
Samuel  Willard,"  contains  more  than  eleven  hun- 
dred pages  (pagination  defective),  and  its  truly 
imposing  list  of  subscribers  accounts  for  the  sale 
of  about  seven  hundred  and  fifty  copies.  It  is 
a  nice  question  whether  the  size  of  the  edition 
of  such  a  monumental  work  may  be  used  as  a 
possible  clue  to  the  number  of  copies  of  our 
Indian  Wars  offered  for  sale  the  same  year. 
Probably  not  but  we  have  no  other  means  of 
knowing.  In  the  case  of  some  other  rare  little 
items,  variations  on  the  title-page  show  that  re- 
issues were  sometimes  made  to  meet  unexpected

demands.  In  this  instance  the  first  edition  seems 
to  have  been  the  last.  Col.  Henchman  established 
the  first  paper  mill  in  New  England,  in  company 
with  his  son-in-law  Thomas  Hancock  and  others. 
His  property  went  to  Hancock  by  will  and 
from  him,  one  of  the  wealthiest  men  in  the 
Province,  a  nephew,  John  Hancock  the  states- 
man, inherited  a  large  property. 

The  name  of  the  printer  Thomas  Fleet,  ap- 
pears on  the  title-page  in  keeping  with  a  cus- 
tom ending  with  the  century.  Originally  a 
London  printer,  he  settled  in  Boston  shortly 
before  1714,  dying  in  1758.  Many  books  issued 
from  his  press  and  though  ''a  good  man,  of 
great  industry,  just  and  benevolent,"  accord- 
ing to  Allen,  he  was  not  a  good  printer,  when 
judged  even  by  the  standards  of  his  time.  The 
Indian  Wars  abounds  in  unskilful  and  incon- 
sistent typography;  misleadmg  errors  are  plenti- 
ful. The  much  worn  type  that  he  used  in  the 
book  was  short  of  the  letter  w,  yet  when  he 
had  set  out  his  font,  he  repeatedly  proceeded 
with  a  wrong  font  character,  as  on  page  19, 
regardless   of   the   appearance   of   his  page. 

The  book  was  printed  quarto,  on  a  sm.all 
sheet  of  English  paper.  In  the  middle  of  each 
is  a  fine  large  heraldic  water-mark;  careful  exam- 
ination, after  unbinding  a  copy,  discloses  an 
escutcheon  supported  by  lions  rampant-gardant. 
Bearing:  a  pale,  charged  lozenge.  Crest:  a  large 
crown.  Trimmed  to  a  narrow  margin,  the  book 
measures  about  six  and  seven-sixteenths  by  four 
and  one-eighth,  though  the  dimension  of  one 
copy   (Brinley  Catalogue,   No.    415)   is  given  as 


'x  INTRODUCTION. 

nearly  one-half  inch  taller.  It  is  bound  in  sheep, 
sometimes  mistaken  for  calf,  over  thin  boards. 
It  is  finished  in  carelessly  executed  blind  tool- 
ing with  two  filets  about  the  edges  and  the  back 
divided  into  four  panels  in  the  same  way.  It 
bore  no  label;  the  sheets  were  fastened  by  two 
leather  strips  passed  through  incisions  near  the 
back. 

Appreciating  our  author's  contributions  to  the 
history  of  his  time  and  place,  it  is  a  bit  discon- 
certing to  find  the  printed  text  of  his  book,  so 
widely  read  for  nearly  two  centuries,  so  fre- 
quently quoted  by  later  historians  and  annalists 
and  so  generally  conceded  to  be  the  authorita- 
tive account,  differing  in  many  particulars  from 
his  original  manuscript,  apparently  his  printer's 
copy.  This,  stitched  into  pamphlet  form  and 
bearing  the  names  of  several  descendants,  was 
found  in  the  Manuscript  Division  of  the 
Library  of  Congress.  It  was  earlier  in  the  pos- 
session of  the  historian  Peter  Force  of  Washing- 
ton. The  more  important  variations  from  the 
printed  text  disclosed  by  a  careful  line  by  line 
collation,  are  incorporated  in  the  Notes  of  the 
present  reprint.  But  only  the  more  important; 
for  so  many  and  so  various  are  the  discrepancies, 
that  their  transcription  would  require  more 
space  than  their  interest  warrants.  Not  only 
are  there  some  differing  spellings  of  places  and 
persons,  but  many  serious  omissions  of  state- 
ment of  fact;  conversely  there  are  found  a  few 
additions  in  the  text  seemingly  added  in  proof- 
reading, it  may  be  by  another  hand.  For  it 
is  not  unlikely,  in  view  of  Penhallow'^s  distance 


INTRODUCTION.  xi 

from  Boston,  or  his  inexperience  in  authorship, 
that  Dr.  Colman  may  have  seen  the  book  through 
the  press;  indeed,  sentence  structure  where  it 
has  been  changed  and  the  occasional  substitu- 
tion of  words  of  classical  derivation  for  homely 
Anglo-Saxon,  suggest  the  cultured  Boston  min- 
ister rather  than  the  forceful  Portsmouth  mer- 
chant. 

That  the  reader,  if  interested,  may  make  the 
comparison  for  himself,  a  page  of  this  original 
manuscript,  selected  more  for  its  legibility  than 
for  the  importance  of  its  variations  from  the 
printed  text,  may  be  found  reproduced  in  fac- 
simile opposite  page  38.  It  corresponds  to  that 
and  the  preceding  page;  about  fifteen  variations 
will  be  discovered.  Whatever  the  explanation 
for  these  discrepancies,  this  study  of  the  manu- 
script has  revealed  some  hitherto  unpublished 
history  quite  as  interesting  and  important  as 
that  which  got  into  the  printed  book. 

Pehhallow's  book  was  reprinted  for  the  first 
time  in  1824,  when  the  Publishing  Committee 
of  the  New  Hampshire  Historical  Society  selected 
it  for  republication  in  the  first  volume  of  the 
Society's  Collections.  Though  the  Indian  Wars 
had  been  printed  only  ninety-eight  years  pre- 
viously, they  noted  the  fact  that  it  ''had  become 
so  scarce,  that  it  was  with  some  trouble  a  com- 
plete copy  could  be  found."  They  therefore 
sought  the  aid  of  ''one  of  the  most  distinguished 
antiquaries  of  New  England  [Abiel  Holmies,)" 
who,  finding  his  own  copy,  used  in  preparing 
the  Annals,  imperfect,  set  about  to  secure  a  per- 
fect copy.    No  one  at  the  meeting  of  the  Amen- 


xii  INTRODUCTION. 

can  Academy,  held  at  that  time,  could  assist 
him  to  a  copy.  Harvard  College  Library  had 
none,  but  he  finally  found .  one  in  the  library 
of  the  Massachusetts  Historical  Society — entire, 
but  "in  great  jeopardy,'' — with  loose  leaves  and 
title-page. 

More  than  likely  this  may  have  been  the 
very  book  used  by  Jeremy  Belknap  in  the  pre- 
paration of  his  History  of  New  Hampshire,  for 
in  the  year  1791, {Proceedings  1791,  p. 21),  he 
had  offered  to  give  to  the  Society,  in  overpay- 
ment of  his  life  membership  fee  of  $34,  among 
others,  these  three  books — Penhallow's  Indian 
Wars,  DooKttle's  Narrative  (1750)  and  Norton's 
Redeemed  Captive  (1748),  each  today  very  scarce 
and  very  valuable.  The  Committee  in  reprint- 
ing, did  not  follow  the  old  orthography  or  typo- 
graphical  style,  but  added  "such  notes  as  might 
serve  to  increase  the  value  of  the  text."  These 
excellent  foot-notes  also  have  been  incorporated 
in  the  Notes  of  the  present  reprint. 

In  1859  there  appeared  another  reprint,  if  it 
may  be  so  designated.  It  is  a  small  quarto  and  its 
title-page  bears  a  transcription  of  the  original, 
not  typographically  faithful  and  with  the  fol- 
lowing imprint:  "Cincinnati:!  Re-printed  from 
the  Boston  Edition  of  1726,  with  a  Memoir  and 
Notes,  for  W.  Dodge,  |  by  J.  Harpel,  corner  Third  | 
&amp;  Vine  Sts.|  1859."  But  this  is  most  decidedly 
not  a  reprint  from  the  Boston  edition  of  1726. 
It  is  in  fact  a  reprint  of  the  reprint  in  the  New 
Hampshire  Collections  of  1824.  It  has  the  typo- 
graphical errors  and,  not  invariably  credited, 
the  notes  of  this  last.    About  twenty  notes  have 


INTRODUCTION.  xiii 

been  added.  According  to  Allibone,  this  edition 
was  privately  printed  and  consisted  of  150  copies. 
It  has  129  pages,  ending  with  Upham's  poem 
taken  from  Farmer  and  Moore's  Collections,  I, 
p.35.  Another  form  was  issued,  com.monly  called 
the  second  edition,  preferred  and  m.ore  often 
seen,  with  a  rubricated  title-page  but  otherwise 
as  the  first,  excepting  that  it  bears  a  device, 
rubricated,  (an  Indian  within  a  shield,  with  a 
legend)  and  the  imprint  is  amended  to  read, 
''with  a  Memoir,  Notes,  and  Appendix,  for|  Wm. 
Dodge  ..."  In  this  issue,  the  129  pages  of  the 
other  are  extended  to  138,  by  selections  from 
Fanner  and  Moore's  Collections,  Trumbull's  In- 
dian Wars,  etc.;  the  added  Appendix  of  36  pages 
contains  Gardener's  Pequot  Wars,  and  other  ex- 
cerpts. 

Examples  of  still  another  issue  were  found. 
It  has  the  rubricated  title-page  of  the  Cincinnati 
issue,  but  bears  the  following  imprint:  ''Phila- 
delphia:!   |by  Oscar  H.  Harpel,  P.  T.,  [Qy. 

Professor  of  Tj^Dography?]  Chestnut  Street, 
1859."  Only  two  copies  of  this  were  discovered 
among  eighty-five  of  the  Cincinnati  edition,  of 
which  seemingly  it  is  merely  a  "freak"  variant. 
So  to,  must  be  considered  still  another  form 
bearing  the  imprint:     "Boston,  1859." 

Any  enumeration  of  the  extant  copies  of  a  rare 
book  is  necessarily  tentative.  One  bibliographer 
compiled  a  list  of  known  copies  of  the  Indian 
Wars,  a  few  years  ago,  in  which  appear  the  copy 
of  the  Library  Company  of  Philadelphia  and 
the  one  in  the  New  York  State  Library,  formerly 
in  the  Warden  collection.     This  last  has  since 


xiv  INTRODUCTION. 

been  burned  but  the  Philadelphia  copy  is  known 
to  have  been  stolen  more  than  a  half  century 
ago.  Such  enumeration  moreover  should  take 
into  account  the  condition  as  well  as  the  loca- 
tion of  the  book.  It  may  be  of  interest  to  con- 
sider now  the  result  of  a  more  ambitious  attempt 
to  list  the  extant  copies  of  the  Indian  Wars, 
completed  after  an  exhaustive  search  in  about  a 
hundred  American  libraries  most  likely  to  con- 
tain the  book  and  the  scrutiny  of  many  of  the 
auction  and  sale  catalogues  issued  during  the 
last  half  century.  Many  of  the  books  thus 
found  have  been  examined  carefully. 

Imperfect  copies  re-bound.  Of  these  about 
a  dozen  are  recorded.  No  more  definite  state- 
ment can  be  made,  as  the  term  ''imperfect"  is 
a  relative  one.  As  to  condition  some  are  not  so 
very  bad, — some  are, — ^''title-page  and  last  page 
in  facsimile,"  "title-page  and  last  three  leaves 
m  facsimile,"  "title-page  mended  and  extended, 
three  leaves  from  a  shorter  copy  and  last  leaf 
in  facsimile,"  "first  twelve  and  last  four  leaves 
in  manuscript" — and  so  they  shade  down  to 
a  few  poor  fragments,  not  worthy  of  consideration. 
Some  of  the  defective  surviving  examples  of  the 
book  started  their  circuit  of  the  auction  rooms 
more  than  a  half  century  ago;  by  the  peculiarity 
in  the  combination  of  their  defects  or  of  bind- 
ing some  may  still  be  identified  as  they  re- 
appear catalogued  from  time  to  time.  One, 
emerging  from  its  concealment  sixty  years  ago 
brought,  in  1866,  at  its  second  sale,  $35.  After 
changing  ownerships  it  sold,  on  its  last  appear- 
ance a  few  years  ago  for  $600.    Another  imper- 


INTRODUCTION.  xv 

feet  copy,  probably  the  one  repeatedly  offered 
in  sale  catalogues  twenty  years  ago  for  $165, 
brought  its  owner,  when  it  was  last  under  the 
hammer,  $975. 

Imperfect  copies  in  original  binding.  Of 
these,  ten  were  found,  four  in  public  libraries. 
Some  are  very  imperfect.  More  than  half  of 
all  imperfect  examples  of  the  book  mourn  the 
loss  of  the  final  leaf  of  Advertisement,  for  when 
the  early  reader  had  corrected  ''the  great  omis- 
sion" on  page  102,  this  nearly  blank  page  served 
for  a  bit  of  writing-paper. 

Perfect  copies  re-bound.  Of  the  seven  in 
this  class,  five  are  in  public  libraries,  the  sixth 
may  be,  and  the  rem.aining  one  is  owned  by 
the  wealthiest  of  American  book  collectors  and 
no  doubt  is  destinated  to  public  ownership. 
Several  perfect  and  re-bound  copies  were  offered 
in  important  English  sale  catalogues  of  many 
years  ago.  Some,  if  not  all  of  these  are  most 
likely  the  identical  ones  here  listed.  At  least 
they  appear  nowhere  else. 

Perfect  copies  in  original  binding.  In 
other  words:  ''collectors'  copies.''  Five  seems 
to  be  their  number,  two  of  which  are  in  public 
libraries,  two  cannot  be  located,  the  remaining 
one  is  privately  owned. 

Thirty-seven  perfect  and  fragmentary  copies 
are  thus  accounted  for.  Of  the  twelve  unmuti- 
lated  examples  of  the  book,  seven  are  now  in 
public  libraries,  five  may  or  may  not  be  here- 
after purchasable.

editors,  as  well  as  those  based  on  recent  his- 
torical study  and  the  addition  of  the  more  im- 
portant unpublished  material  in  the  original  man-

enlarge  the  contents  of  the  book  as  originally 
pubhshed.  There  has  been  added  that  which

book — an  Index.

THE  keeping  a  Regifier  of  Memcrahle  Oc-

And  in  as  much  as  the  Divine  Providence  has  pter 
ccd  me  near  the  Seat  of  Acflion,  where  I  have 
had  greater  Opportunities  than  many  others  of 
remarking  the  Cruelty  and  Perfidy  of  the  Indian 
Enemy,  I  thought  it  my  Duty  to  keep  a  Record 
thereof.  Not  that  at  firft  I  defign'd  to  make  thefe 
Memoirs  pub!ick  but  now  am  perfwaded  to  it  by 
fame  whofe  Judgment  I  pay  a  deference  anta 
In  the  collcAing  them,  I  have  us'd  all  faithf^l-

I  might  with  Orofiui  very  juflly  enritle  thisHif-

Scourge  for  che  punifliment  of  our  Sins.  And 
probably  that  very  Sin  of  ours  in  negle&lt;fling  the 
welfare  cf  their  Souls,  For  'uft  have  not  exprefTed 
the  like  laudable  Care  for  them,  as  hath  been 
done  in  the  Southtrn  and  pyefiern  parrs  of  the 
Country.  But  indeed  we  have  rather  aimed  to 
advance  a  private  Trade,  then  to  inftrud  them  in 
the  Principles  of  true  Reh'gion.  This  brings  to 
my  remembrance  a  remarkable  faying  of  one  of 
their  Chief  Sacbemr,  whom  (a  little  before  the 
War  broke  out)  I  asked.  Wherefore  it  was  they 
were  fo  much  bigoted  to  the  French  ?  Confider- 
ing  their  Traffick  with  them  was  not  fo  advan- 
tageous as  with  the  Efiglijh.  He  gravely  reply'd. 
That  the  Friars  taught  (hem  to  T*ray,  hut  the  Fng- 
lijh  never  did 

And  it  is  alfo  remarkably  obfervable  that  a- 
mong  all  the  Settlements  and  Towns  of  Figure  and 
Diflin(5lion,  not  one  of  them  have  been  utterly 
deilroyM  where  ever  a  Church  was  gathered. 

But  if  the  Eaflern  farts  have  been  remifs,  this 
fliould  no  ways  detrad  from  the  praife  of  that  in- 
comparable zeal  of  the  Venerable  Mr.  Elliot^  and 
the  indefatigable  Pains  which  the  renowned  Mr- 
M&lt;iyhcwy  and  others,  have  exercifed  in  the  In- 
ftru(5tion  and  Converfion  of  the  Natives  in  their 
parts :  wherein  they  were  fo  far  Succefsful  (thro' 
che  Blefling  of  God)  as  to  form  many  Churches 
ofBaptizM  Indians '^  %v\^  to  gather  many  Affcm-

NOT  that  I  am  unfenfible  that  many  have  ftig- 
matiz'dthe  Englijh  as  chiefly  culpable  in  caufing 
(he  lirft  Breach  between  them  and  us ;  by  invad- 
ing their  Properties,  and  defrauding  them  in 
their  Dealings :  But  to  cenfurc  the  Publick  for 
the  finifter  Atflions  of  a  few  private  Perfons,  is 
utterly  repugnant  to  Reafon  and  Equity.  Efpe- 
cially  confidering  the  great  Care  that  the  Legi^

and  their  Intercfts- 

WHAT  hath  formerly  occur'd  of  this  kind  is 
none  of  my  bufinefs  to  difcant  upon  here  ;  but 
as  to  the  Infradion  which  I  am  about  to  make 
mention  of_,  I  never  yet  heard  the  leaft  Word  in 
their  favour,  but  all  forts  of  Perfons  do  condemn 
their  Perfidy 

AT  the  arrival  of  Governour  Dudley  in  the 
Year  1702.  the  whole  Body  ol  Indians  was  in  a  to- 
lerable good  Frame  and  Temper  ;  but  being  ani- 
mated by  the  French,  they  foon  began  to  threaten 
and  infult  the  Engliflf:  Upon  which  in  the  fuc-

AT  this  they  made  a  paufe,  but  after  a  fhort

tor arofe,  and  faid,  *^  That  they  acknowledged

the  TWO  BROTHERS  ;  unto  which  both  Par- 
ties wcnr^  and  added  a  greater  Number  of  Srones. 

THIS  Ceremony  being  performed,  feveral 
Volleys  were  difcharged  on  each  fide  ;  and  the 
Indians  added  their  ufual  dancing,  Tinging,  and 
loud  acclamations  of  Joy-  Trading- houjes  in  fcve*

In  of  Captain  BomafeenyZn^  Captain  Samuel,wh(y 
informed,  that  feveral  Mlffionaries  from  the  Frjart 
were  lately  come  among  them,  who  endeavour- 
ed to  break  the  Union,  and  feduce  them  from 
their  Allegiance  to  the  Crown  oi  England ;  but 
had  made  no  Impreffion  on  them,  for  thaMhey 
were  as  firm  as  the  Mountains^  and  fhould  conti- 
nue fo,  as  long  as  the  Sun  and  Moon  endured. 

THE  Eafiern  Inhabitants,  who  before  had 
thoughts  of  removing,  were  now  encouraged  to 
ftafnd  their  Ground  j  feveral  more  were  alio  pre- 
paring to  fettle  among  them,  partly  from  the 
fertility  of  the  Soil,  the  plemy  of  Timber,  the 
advan!:age  of  Fifliery,  and  feveral  other  Induce- 
ipnents.  But  I  fhould  have  taken  notice  of  two 
Inftances  in  the  late  Treaty,  wherein  the  match- 
lefs  Perfidy  of  thefe  bloody  Infidels  did  notori- 
Ofjfly  appear,  i/.  As  the  Treaty  was  concluded 
with  Volleys  on  both  fides,  as  1  faid  befote,  the 
Indians  defired  the  EngUflj  to  fire  firft,  which  they 
readily  did,  concluding  it  no  other  but  a  Com- 
plement ;  but  fo  foon  as  the  Indians  fired,  it  was 
obferv'd  that  their  Guns  were  charg'd  with  Bui- 
Jets;  having  contrived  (as  was  afterwards  con- 
iirm'd)  to  make  the  Engtiji)  the  Vidkims  of  that 
Day.  But  Providence  lo  order'd  it,  as  to  place 
their  chief  Counfellours  and  Sachems  in  the  Tent 
where  ours  were  feated,  by  which  means  they 
could  not  deftroy  one  without  endangering  the 
other!  2.  As  the  Englijh  waited  fome  Days  for 
Watanummon  (the  Vigwacket  Sachem)  to  compleat 
their  Council,  it  was  afterward  difcover-ed,  chat 
they  only  tarried  for  a  F  einforcement  of  200 
Fnncb  and  Indians ^  who  in  three  Days  after  we 

returned 


is) 

returned  came  among  them  ,•  having  refolvcilto 
feize  the  Governour,  Council  and  Gentlemen, 
and  then  to  Sacrifice  the  Inhabitants  at  pleafure; 
which  probably  they  might  have  done,  had  they 
not  been  prevented  by  an  overuling  Power. 

Bat  notwithftanding  this  Difappointment,  they 
were  ftill  refoWed  on  their  bloody  Defgn :  For 
within  fix  Weeks  after  the  whole  Eaftern  Coun- 
try was  in  a  Conflagration,  no  Houfe  flanding^ 
nor  Garrifon  unattackt.  ^ugufi  loth  at  nine  in 
the  Morning  they  began  their  bloody  Tragedy y 
being  about  five  hundred  Indians  of  all  forts,  with 
a  number  of  Fremh  •  who  divided  thcmfelves  in- 
to feveral  Companies,  and  made  a  Defcent  on 
the  feveral  Inhabitants  from  Cafco  to  IVells  at  one 
and  the  fame  time,  fparing  none  of  every  Age  or 
Sex. 

AS  the  milk  white  Brows  of  the  Grave  and 
Ancient  had  no  refpe&lt;5l  (hown  ;  fo  neither  had 
the  mournful  cries  of  tender  Infants  the  leaft  pity; 
for  they  triumph'd  at  their  Mifery,  and  applaud- 
ed fuch  as  the  skilfulleft  Artifts,  who  were  moft 
dexterous  in  contriving  the  greateft  Tortures; 
which  was  enough  to  turn  the  \wo(iStoical  Apathie 
fiito  Streams  of  mournful  Sympathy  and  Compaf- 
fion. 

THE  Town  of  Weils,  which  valiantly  flood 
its  Ground  both  in  the  former  and  latter  War, 
fuffered  now  great  Spoil,  nor  could  efcape  with- 
out the  lofs  of  59  that  were  kiird  and  taken. 

Cape^forfofs  beinrg  inhabited  only  by  a  few 
Fifhermcn,  was  wholly  laid  defolate.  But  the 
Garrifon  at  Wmur-Harhour  defended  itfelf  with 
much  Bravery  •   yet  ic  was  at  lalt  overpowered 

by 


by  Force,  and  then  fuhmlercd  on  Terms 

Saco  Fort  was  alfo  artackt  by  the  Enemy  with 
great  Fury  ;  they  kilKd  eleven,  and  carried  twen- 
ty four  Captive. 

Sfunif'tnkj  which  was  principally  inhabited  by 
the  Jordansy  had  no  lefs  than  twenty  two  of  that 
Family  kill'd  and  taken. 

THOSE  at  Scarhofough  were  moftly  in  Garri- 
fon,  whom  the  Indians  not  willing  to  encounter, 
fent  a  Captive  before  with  a  Flag  of  Truce;  but 
the  Officer  being  acquainted  with  their  Intreagues, 
flighted  the  Meffage,  fecured  the  Captive,  and 
made  a  vigorous  Defence.  However,  by  a  long 
Siege  they  were  fo  reduced,  that  had  not  Re- 
cruits been  fent  them,  they  had  utterly  been  o- 
verthrown. 

Perpooduck  was  of  all  places  (for  number)  the 
greateft  fuiferers^  being  but  nine  Families,  and 
no  Garrifon  to  retire  unto  ;  neither  any  Men  at 
home,  where  they  took  eight,  and  inhumanly 
butchered  twenty  five ;  among  whom  was  the 
Wife  of  Michael  fVMer,  who  being  big  with 
Child,  they  knockt  her  on  the  head,  and  ript 
open  her  Womb,  cutting  one  part  of  the  Child 
out ;    a  Spedacle  of  horrid  Barbarity* 

Cafco,  which  was  the  utmoft  Frontier,  com* 
manded  by  Major  March,  who  was  all  this  while 
unrenfible  of  the  Spoil  that  the  Indians  had  done, 
was  faluted  by  MauxU,  JVanungonety  and  Affacom- 
htiitt  three  of  their  mod  valiant  and  puiffaht  Sa- 
ehems.  They  gradually  advanced  with  a  Flag 
of  Truce,  and  fenc  one  before  them  to  ftgnify 
that  they  had  matter  of  moment  to  impart  to 

him.

Jiim.    At  firfl  he  flighted  the  Meflage,  but  on 
iecond  Thoughts  wenc  our   to  meet  them;   they 
feeming  to  him  but  few  in  number,   and  unarm^ 
ed  :   However  he  ordered  two  or  three  Senrinels 
to  be  ready  in  c^k  of  Danger.     Their  Voice  to 
him  at  ftrft  feem'd  like  the  Voice  ot  Jacoh,  buc 
their  Hands  were  like  the  Hands  of  Efau  :    iVith 
their  Tongues  they  ufed  deceit y  and  the  Poifon  of  Ajpi 
was  under  their  Lips,   For  no  fooner  had  rbe&gt;  fa- 
luted  him,  but  with  Hatchets  under  their  Mantles 
they  violently  affaulted  him  ;  having  a  number 
that  lay  in  Ambufh  near  them,  who  (hot  down 
one  of  his  Guards :    But   being   a   Perfon  of  un- 
common Strength,  as  well  as  Courage,  he  foon 
wrerted  a  Hatchet  from  one  of  them,  with  which 
he  did  good  Execution  :    Yet   if  Sergeant  Hook 
(with  a  file  of  Ten  from  the  Forr)  had  not  fpee- 
dily  fuccoured  him,  they  would  foon   have  over- 
powered him.     Mr.  Phippeny  znd  Mr.  Kent^    who 
accompanied  him,    were  attackt  by  others,  and 
foon  fell  by    their  Fury  ;  for  being  advanced  in 
Years,  they  were  fo  infirm,  thar  1  might   fay  of 
them   as  Juvenal  did  of  Priam ^  They    had  fcarce 
Blood  enough  left  to  tinge  the  Knife  of  the  Sa- 
crifice. 

THE  Enemy  being  defeated  in  this  their  De- 
fign,  fell  upon  the  (everal  Cottages  which  lay 
round,  and  deilroyed  all  they  could.  But  th« 
Major  on  rallying  his  Men  together,  feeing  no- 
thing but  Fire  and  Smoak,  divided  them  into 
three  parts,  which  were  twelve  in  each,  and  in- 
terchanged them  every  two  Hours,  who  thus 
continued  fix  Days  and  Nights  without  the  lead 
ImecmiiHon ;  by  which  time  ihe  whole  Body»of 

Indiani

Tnd'tans  came  together,  being  upwards  of  five 
hundred,  beddes  French  commanded  by  Monfieur 
BohaffcYy  who  had  ranfackt  and  laid  waft  the  fe- 
veral  Settlements  before- mentioned;  and  being 
flufht  with  Succefsj  having  taken  one  Sloop,  two 
Shallops,  and  much  Plunder,  attempted  to  un- 
dermine the  Fort  from  the  Water  fide  in  which 
they  proceeded  two  Days  and  Nights&gt;  and  pro- 
bably would  have  efFeded  their  Dengn,  if  they 
had  not  been  prevented  by  the  arrival  of  Capt. 
Southacky  who  raifed  the  fiege,  retook  the  Shal- 
lop, and  (battered  their  f^avy^  which  was  upward 
of  200  Cannoos. 

ON  Tuefday  after  Capt.  Tovf,  with  thirty  Jndi' 
ans^  made  a  defcent  on  Hampton  Village,  where 
they  flew  four,  befides  the  Widow  Muffey,  who 
was  a  remarkable  fpeaking  ^aker,  and  much 
lamented  by  that  Sc8:.  They  alfo  rifled  two 
Houfes  near  the  Garrifon,  but  fearing  a  purfujc^ 
drew  off;  it  being  generally  obferved,  that  tney 
leldom  annoy  but  by  furprize. 

BY  this  time  Capt.  Summersby  was  ordered 
with  his  Troop  to  Tsrtfmoutb^  and  Capt.  WadUy 
to  WtBs  with  the  like  Company  of  Dragoons  \ 
many  concluding  that  the  Eapetm  parts  would  be 
the  feat  of  A&lt;5tion ;  and  yet  a  few  Days  after. 
Advice  was  brought  from  DeerfieU,  (as  a  fore-

and  carried  to  Canada ;  which  fo  alarm'd  the 
Country,  to  fee  the  Frontiers  infulted  two  hun-

Governovr  ordered  ^60  Men  to  Figv^acluty  one 
of  their  principal  Head- quarters:  But  thro* the 
difficulty  of  the  Paffage,  and  umkillulncfs  of  the 

Gaidcsi

Guides,  they  return*d  without  any  Dlfcovery. 

Cape.  Davu  at  the  fame  time  had  the  like 
misfortune,  who  went  to  the  Ponds,  but  it  feem'd 
the  Enemy  went  Eafiward-,  For  on  the  6th.  of  Oc- 
tobcvy  Capt.  Hunnuell  with  nineteen  Men,  as  they 
were  going  to  work  in  their  Meadows  at  Blacks 
fom,  were  way-laid  by  two  hundred  Indians^  who 
at  one  ftroke  killed  and  took  the  whole  body  Ex- 
cepting one,  who  like  Jo^i  Mfjfenger  was  pre- 
ferved  to  give  the  Melancholy  Account  thereof. 
Upon  this  they  attack't  the  Forty  where  only 
Eight  Men  were  left  under  the  Command  of 
Lieu.  Wyaty  who  by  the  encouragement  of  Capt. 
JViUard^  and  Capt.  WtUsy  that  were  there  in  two 
Sloops  ftood  their  Ground  fome  time,  but  being 
afterward  difpirited  they  went  on  board  Capt. 
WeUsy  and  the  Enemy  let  the  deferted  Garrifon 
on  fire. 

Another  Company  of  Indians  commanded  by 
Sarnffon  fell  on  Torky  where  they  flew  Arthur 
Brandon's  Wife  and  h^t  Children,  carrying  Cap- 
tive with  them  the  Widow  Varfom  and  her 
Daughter* 

The  former  attempt  on  Vigw ackett ^^o'^mg  un-

At  Berwick  they  ambufht  five,  and  as  the  (lore 
Ship  was  entring  Cafco,  they  entertained  them  fo 
unexpe&lt;fledly  with  a  Volley  of  Shot,  that  the 
Maftcr  with  three  more  were  Slain,  and  two  in 
the  Boat  wounded. 

The  Central  yiffemhly  being  fenfibly  afFe&lt;5led 
with  the  (late  of  matters,  and  difpos'd  to  a  Vigo- 
rous profecution  of  the  War,  enaded,  That  Forty 
bounds  fliould  be  given  for  every  Indian  Scalps 
which  prompted  fome,  and  animated  others  to  a 
noble  Emulation.  Capt.  Ting  was  the  firfl:  that 
embraced  the  tender,  who  in  the  depth  of  Win- 
ter, went  to  their  head  quatters,  and  got  ^"^Q^  for

like  Effay,  and  fo  did  Cape.  Stephens,  but  return- 
ed with  no  other  Lawrel  than  the  fafety  of  them- 
felves  and  Company. 

The  Enemy  went  on  daring  and  fuccefsful. 
They  frequently  followed  the  tr^ds  of  our  Men 
in  their  Marches  :  At  Berwick  they  kill'd  one, 
wounded  another,  and  burnt  two  Houfes.  Aftec 
that  they  made  a  defcent  on  Andrew  Neals  Garri- 
fon,  where  they  were  vigoroufly  repuls'd  by 
Capr,  iirown,  who  kWd  nine  on  the  foot  and 
wounded  many  more,  which  fo  enraged  thofe 
Wretches^  that  at  their  return  they  executed  their 
revenge  on  J^fiph  Ring  who  was  then  a  Cap-

February  8th.  Jofeph  BradUys  Garrifon  of

Scour,  whofculking  ata  diftance,  and  feeing  the

ceiving the  Mifery  that  was  attending  her,  and 
having  boiling  Soap  on  the  Fire,  fcalded  one  of 
chem  to  Death-  The  Sentinel  within  was  flatn, 
and  (he  with  feveral  others  were  taken ;  which 
was  the  fccond  time  of  her  Captivity.  But  thac 
which  heightned  her  Afflidion  was  being  with 
Child,  and  yet  obliged  to  travel  in  a  deep  Snow, 
under  a  heavy  Burden,  and  many  Days  together 
without  Subfiftance,  excepting  a  few  bits  of  Skin, 
Ground-nius,  Bark  of  Trees,  wild  Onions,  and 
Lilly  Roots.  Neverthelefs  fhe  was  wonderfully 
fupported,  and  at  laft  (afely  delivered ;  but  the 
Babe  foon  periflu  for  want  of  Nouriftimenc,  and 
by  the  Cruelty  of  the  Indians^  who  as  it  cry'd,

Bondage  fhe  was  fold  to  the  French  for  eighty 
Livers,  and  then  redeemed  by  her  Husband.

in  travelling. 

BUT  the  Southern  Parts  not  thinking  them- 
felves  in  fo  much  Danger,  did  in  a  little  time  be* 
come  fecure,  which  the  Enemy  taking  notice  off 
fell  on  DeerfidJf  of  which  the  Reverend  Mr. 
StodJard  gave  me  the  following  Account.  That

ftor  of  that  Place,  was  ftrongly  pofleft  that  the 
Town  would  in  a  little  time  be  deft roycd  j  fig- 
nifying  as  much  in  his  publick  Miniftry,  and 
private  Conference ;  and  could  not  be  fatisfted 
til!  he  had   got    twenty  Soldiers  tp  be  polled 
there.    A  few  Nights  before  the  Affault  was, 
they   were  ftrangely  amufed,  by  a  trampling 
Noife  round  the  Fort,  as  if  it  were  befet  by  In- 
dians.    Towards  Morning,  being  February  29th. 
the  Enemy  fent  Scouts  to  difcover  the  pofture  cA 
the  Town,  who  obferving   the  Watch  walking 
in  the  Streets,  returned  and  put  them  toaftand  : 
A  while  after  they  fent  again,  and  were  advifed, 
that  all  was  then  ftiil  and  quiet :  Upon  which, 
two  hours  before   Day,  they  attackt  the  Fort, 
and  by  the  advantage  of  fome  drifts  of  Snow, 
got  over  the  Walls.   The  whole  Body  was  above 
two  hundred  and  fifty,   under  the  Command  of 
Monfieur  Arteily  who  found  the  People  faft  alleep 
and  eafily  fecured   them.  The  moft  confiderable 
part  of  the  Town  thus   fell  into  their  Hands. 
They  left  no  Garrifon  unattackt,  excepfing  that 
of  Caot.  WtUs  ^  But  at  Bemni  Stebbins's  they  met 
With  lome  repuMe,  and  loft  feveral.    Sixty  of  the 
Englijh  fell,  whereof  many  were  ftifled  in  a  Cel- 
ler ;  and  a  hundred  were  taken  Captive,  who 
with  a  melancholly  Countenance  condoled  each 
Other's  Mifery,  yet  durft  not  exprefs  the  Aneuifli 
of  their  Souls.     That  Day  and  Night  were  ipent 
in   plundering,    burning   and   deftroying.    The 
next  Morning   they  wichdrcw   into  the  Woods, 
carrying  with  them  their  Plunder  and  Captives  ,•

Neighbours,  through  a  desp  Snow,  over  moua- 
tainous  Defarcs,  were  exceeding  great  ,•  befides 
many  Triab  and  Fears  which  th&amp;y  laboured  un- 
der 

The  Country  being  alarm'd,  feveral  haftned  to 
their  Relief;  about  thirty  of  chofe  which  firft 
came,  charged  the  Enemy  in  the  r&amp;ar,  and  being 
flrengthned  with  a  farther  Supply,  purfued  them 
with  good  Sacccfs  |  but  the  Enemy  returning, 
and  being  much  fupcriour  in  Number,  kiil'd  nine 
of  ours  in  the  Skirmifh 

The  Day  after  there  was  a  confuJcrable  Con* 
fiuence  from  the  lower  Towns,  as  well  as  from 
the  County  of  Hartford^  but  for  warvt  of  Snow^ 
jl-/o€s,  were  unable  to  purfue  them.  Some  of  our 
Captives  then  in  Canada,  knowing  the  Eoeerpfize 
that  was  on  Foot,  fern  fevera)  Letters  unto  their 
Friends,  which  the  Enemy  did  carefully  put  into 
3  Bag,  and  hung  it  upon  the  limb  of  a  Tree  in 
the  high-way  ;  which  Letters  were  afterwards 
found,  and  give  Satisfa(5lion  of  thofc  that  were 
then  alive  among  them. 

While  the  InMam  by  Land  were  every  way 
dif^reffing  of  us,  the  Prenth  by  Sea  were  as  in- 
duftrious  to  impoveridi  us, 

yiprit  7thi  1704.  they  fitted  out  a  TrivaUer 
Shallop  with  twenty  feven  Men,  to  intercept  our 
Southern  Trade  as  chey  came  iaden  with  Provifi* 
ens ;  which  if  they  had  fucceeded  in,  would  not 
only  have  fupplied  their  own  indigent  Forces, 
but  the  Indians  alfo;  (who  were  then  forming  a 
defperate  Defjgn  againft  us.J  But  thro' (he  favour

Shore.  A  like  fignal  Favour  to  us  was  the  taking 
a  Siore-Ship  of  theirs  (by  our  Virginia  Fleet)  of 
Forty  Guns,  bound  to  Canada,  in  which  were 
twenty  Officers,  two  thoufmd  fmall  Arms,  with 
Ammunition  anfwerable  ;  befides  a  vaft  number 
of  Crucifixes,  and  Prefents  of  a  greater  value  for 
encouraging  the  Indians  in  a£ts  of  Hoftility  againft 
the  Englijh.  In  the  Engagement  their  General 
was  flain,  the  only  Man  that  fell  in  Battle,  by 
whofe  Intereft  thofe  Stores  were  procured  ;  which 
lofs  was  fo  aflfeding,  that  ^as  lomc  of  our  Cap- 
tives afterwards  reported)  it  caufed  a  deep  Hu- 
miliation throughout  Canada  a  confiderable  time 
after. 

As  the  Spring  advanced,  it  was  thought  necef- 
fary  to  guard  the  Frontiers  with  frefh  Troops, 
upon  which  Major  Mafm  with  ninety  five  of  the 
Te&lt;juody  and  Mobegan  Indians  were  pofted  at  JB^r- 
wtck^  who  at  firft  were  very  terrifying  to  the  E- 
nemy :  Yet  frequent  affaults  were  afterwards 
made  at  a  little  Diftance,  as  on  Afril  ayrh.  Na* 
thaniel  Meador  was  (hot  while  at  work  in  his 
Field.  They  mangled  his  dead  Corps  after  a 
barbarous  manner.  Next  day  they  kilJ'd  Edward 
Taylor  nt^v Lawpreel  River,  and  after  that  took  his 
IVife  and  Son  whom  they  carried  to  Canada,  and 
ftie  was  afterwards  redeemed.  From  thence  they 
went  to  Cochccho,  expeding  to  have  made  Mr, 
JValdron  the  Viclim  of  that  Day  ;  but  being  happi* 
ly  from  home,  they  mifs't  their  aim.  However 
they  furprizM  a  Servant  of  his,  as  fiie  went  to  the 
Well  for  Water,  whom  (  after  they  had  examin- 
ed concerning  her  Mafter,  the  State  of  the  Garri- 
ion^  and  other  AifairsJ  they  knockt  on  the  head, 

buc 


but  the  Stroke  not  proving  fatal,  (Tie   afterwards 
recovered. 

After  this  feveral  were  aflaulted  in  the  Road  to 
JVells,  Whereof  two  were  kiird,one  taken,  and  a- 
nothcr  made  his  Efc^pe. 

Afay  T^th.  an  Exprefs  c^me  from  North  Hamp- 
ton^ adviilng,  that  about  break  of  Day  a  Company 
oi  Frertcb  and  Indians^  fell  on  a  fortified  Honfe  at 
Pafcomuck,  where  no  watch  being  kept,  the  Peo- 
ple were  alarm'd  in  their  beds  by  the  noife  of  the 
Enemy's  rufhing  on  the  houfe  ;  and  before  the 
Inhabitants  could  rife,  the    Indians  had  got  their 
Guns  thro'  the  Vort-hoUsy  and  fliot  thofe  that  iirft 
appeared,  killing   feme    and   wounding    others. 
The  Turprized  People  made  what  refiftance  they 
could,  firing  briskly  on  the  Enemy ;  but  the  houfe 
being^  foon  fet  on  fire,  they  were  forc'd  to  yield 
themfelves  Prifoners.   The  Enemy  foon  drew  off, 
but  fearing  a  purfuit,   difmift  one  of  the  wound- 
ed, with  this  Caution,  that  if  the  Englijh  follow- 
ed them  they  would  Slay  the  Prifoners,  but  the 
unfortunate  Meffenger  in   returning   back   was 
Slain  by  another  Indian.    On  the  fame  Morning 
another  Party  attacked  a  Farm  houfe  two  Miles 
aSi.  but  the  ftjry  of  the  Dogs  fo  alarm'd  the  InhA- 
bitanfs,  that  they  inftantly  got  up  and  fired   fe- 
veral Guns  to  very  good  advantage,  which  pre- 
vented any  further  attempt.     As  for  thofe  at  Paf" 
ccmttek  they  were  immediatly  purfued,  three  made 
an  Efcape,  eight  were  refcucd,  nineteen  fiain,  &amp; 
three  carryed  to  Canada,  Next  day  Major  White* 
tngy  purfued  them  with  a  number  of  Horfes,  and 
came  upon  their  Track,  but  the  Ways  were  fo 
tmpaffibiei  that  they  fenc  ;heir  Horfes  back  with, 

a 


a  refolve  to  follow  them  on  Foot,  but  fome  prov- 
ing lame,  and  others  tyring,  caufed  the  reft  to 
defift.  I  would  here  remark,  chat  a  little  before 
the  Troubles  at  Pafcomucky  and  the  Farm-  houfe 
before  menrioned,  the  People  at  Springfield  heard 
s  great  (hooting  ;  Unto  fome  it  feem'd  to  be  at 
WeJlfaU,  to  others  at  a  Village^  and  to  fome  again 
in  the  Woods ;  fo  that  many  haftned  to  their  affift- 
ance  ;  but  when  they  came  all  was  ftill  and  qui- 
et, the  reafon  whereof  is  hard  to  affign,  and  yet 
we  have  repeated  inftances  in  Hiftory  of  the  like 
nature. 

Under  all  thoie  Sufferings  from  a  cruel  Enemy 
little  01  no  impreflion  could  ever  be  made  by  us 
upon  them,  by  reafon  of  their  retiring  into  un- 
acceffable  Swamps,  and  Mountains,  Wherefore 
it  wa5  determined^  chat  Major  Church,  who  was 
fo  eminently  Serviceable  in  the  former  War, 
iliould  vjfit  their  head  quarters,  according  to  a 
Scheme  which  he  had  projc&lt;5led. 

No  fooner  was  his  Commiffion  granted,  but  he 
rais'd  a  confiderable  number  of  Volunteers  out  of 
Tlimoitth  Colony  both  of  Englijh  indifiiend  Indians, 
and  maiched  to  Nantaskett  for  further  Inftrudi-

went  along,  til!  they  came  to  the  Green  Iflands, 
where  they  took  Monileur  Lafehure^  and  his  two 
Zonsmt\\  fi  Canada  Indian^  whom  they  examined 
apart :  The  Father  at  firft  feem'd  Surly  and  Croo- 
ked, and  the  young  Men  were  much  of  the  like 
Temper,  but  being  told  what  they  muft  cruft  un- 
to in  cafe  they  did  not  confefs,  were  afterwards 
Submiffive,  and  promis'd  to  Pilot  them  where  c- 
ver  they  were  dire(^ed.  Upon  this  the  Tranf- 
ports  and  Whaleboats  were  ordered  to  be  in  a  rea- 
dinefs,  and  every  Man  to  have  a  weeks  Provifi- 
on  ;  From  hence  they  paddled  to  Pencbfcot,  and 
with  the  affiRance  of  one  D'  Totwg,  whom  they 
bro't  out  of  Bofion  Goal  on  purpofe  for  a  Pilot, 
killed  and  took  a  confiderable  number  both  o^t 
Frsvch  and  Indians,  among  whom  was  St-  Cafteen  s 
Daughter.  From  thence  they  went  to  Pajfamaffua- 
Ja,  and  Mount  Defart,  where  they  met  the  thfcei 
Ships  of  War  according  to  Appointment.  TheiH 
Cuftom  was  to  reft  in  the  Day,  and  row  in  the 
Night;  and  never  to  fire  at  an  Indian  if  they  could 
reach  him  with  a  Hatchet,  for  fear  of  allarming 
them.  Here  they  fiez'd  the  Old  Lotriili  and  his 
Family,  after  that  Mounfier  Guorden^  and  Sbarkee, 
who  a  little  before  came  with  a  Comiffion  from 
Canada  to  form  an  Expedition  againft  the  Engliflu 
Ho  fooner  had  our  Forces  arrived  here,  but  Or-

to  f&amp;rt'Royally  expe^ing  fbme  ftore  Ships  from 
Franct^  which  was  welcome  News  for  Officera  ^ 
Soldiers.  But  they  mifs'd  of  their  Expe&lt;ftations :

cil  of  War  was  held,  and  Licvt.  Giles  was  fent  to 
the  Town  with  a  Flag  of  Truce  and  Summons  to

Upon  which  a  defcent  was  made  upon  them  chat 
Night,  but  little  effeded  until  the  Morning,  and 
then  the  Forces  drew  up  and  drove  all  before 
them. 

There  was  at  this  time  a  confiderable  pletity  of 
Brandy,  and  Clarret  in  their  Houfes,  which  ra- 
ther proved  a  fnare  than  fervice  to  our  Men|  E- 
fpecially  the  Indians^  who  naturally  affe&lt;ft  ftrong 
Drink,  but  this  was  foon  prevented,  by  breaking 
in  the  heads  of  the  Casks-  Lieutenant  Baker 
and  one  more  were  killed  in  this  Attack,  and 
not  above  fix  died  in  the  whole  Expedition. 
Mod  of  their  Houfes  were  burnt,  and  much  Plun- 
der taken,  but  with  as  little  EfFufion  of  Blood  as 
poflibly  could  be.  The  General  ordered  their 
Damms  to  be  dug  down,  and  their  Fortifications 
CO  be  laid  in  Aflies-  Having  as  great  fuccefs  as 
reafonably  could  be  expected,  thro'  out  all  the 
Territorys  of  L'  Accadia^  and  Nova  Scotia^  where 
he  took  a  hundred  Prifoners,  burnt  and  laid  waft 
all  the  French  Settlements,  (except  the  Town  of 
Tort  Royal  )  a  great  many  Cattle  were  alfo  kill'd, 
and  the  Indians  driven  into  fuch  Confufion,  that 
they  left  their  Wigwams  and  retired  into  private 
Cells. 

ON  July  4th.  a  Council  of  War  was  call'd  to 
concert  what  next  to  do,  who  refolved,  that  as  the 
Fort  was  alarmed,  the  Enemy  was  more  nume- 
rous than  at  firit  \  and  chat  as  many  of  our  Men 

were

Sea-Officers.  But  notwithftanding  the  Fatigue 
that  this  worthy  Gentleman  had  undergone,  and 
the  Dangers  he  had  run  j  the  Spoil  he  had  done^ 
9nd  the  Viflories  he  wan,  yet  he  could  not  elh 
cape  the  Cenfures  of  many.  Some  indeed  ex* 
tol'd  his  Valour  and  Condud  even  to  an  Hjfer* 
hie,  while  others  endeavoured  to  leffen  it  wjih 
as  much  Difgrace  and  Infamy.  Some  thought 
he  did  too  much,  others  too  little :  Bat  after  one 
and  another  had  pafs'd  their  Sentiments,  the  Ge- 
neral  Affemhly  (which  Was  then  fitting)  voted  him 
Thanks  for  the  good  Services  be  did  both  to  the  Queen

While  our  Forces  were  engaged  in  vifiting  the

SOme  time  in  the  Month  of  May,  1704.  there 
came  Intelligence  from  Albany,  of  a  numbet 
of  Enemy  Indians  up  Conne6licut  River*  who  had 
built  a  Forr,  and  planted  Corn,  at  a  place  called 
Cowajfuck,  On  the  fifth  of  Jtine  following,  we 
fet  out  (by  order  of  Authority)  from  Northampton^ 
and  went  nine  Days  Journey  into  the  Wildernefs, 
(thro'  much  Difficulty,  by  reafon  of  the  Enemy's 
Hunting  and  Scouting  in  the  Woods,  as  we  per- 
ceived by  their  Tracks  and  Firing)  and  then  came 
acrofs  fome  frefli  Tracks,  which  we  followed  till 
we  came  in  fight  of  the  abovcfaid  River :  Sup- 
pofing  there  might  be  a  Number  of  Indians  at 
hand  ;  we  being  not  far  from  the  place  where 
the  Fort  was  faid  to  be  built.  Here  we  made  a 
Halt,  to  confult  what  Methods  to  take  j  and  fdon 
concluded  to  fend  out  a  Spy,  with  Green  Leaves 
for  a  Cap  and  Vefie^  to  prevent  his  own  Difcove- 
yy,  and  to  find  out  the  Enemy.    But  before  our 

Spy 


spy  was  gone  out  of  fight,  we  ft  w  two  InJUans^ 
at  a  confiderable  diftance  from  us,  in  a  Cannoo^ 
and  To  immediately  recall'd  him:  And  foon  aftet 
we  heard  the  firing  of  a  Gun  up  the  River.  Up- 
on which  we  concluded  to  keep  clofe  till  Sun- 
fet  ;  and  then  if  we  could  make  any  further  Dif- 
covery  of  the  Enemy,  to  attack  them,  if  poffible, 
in  the  Night.  And  accordingly,  when  the  Even- 
ing came  on,  we  mov'd  towards  the  River,  and 
foon  perceived  a  Swohy  at  about  half  a  Milej 
diftance,  as  we  tho't,  where  we  (afterwards) found 
they  had  taken  up  their  Lodging.  But  fo  great 
was  the  Difficulty,  that  ftho'  we  ufed  our  urmoft 
Care  and  Diligence  in  it)  we  were  not  able  to 
make  the  approach  till  about  T-iVo  a  Clock  in 
the  Morning,  when  we  came  within  Twelve 
Rods  of  the  Wigwam,  where  they  lay.  But  here 
we  met  with  a  new  Difficulty,  which  we 
fear'd  would  have  ruin'd  the  whole  Defign :  For 
the  Ground  was  fo  covered  over  with  dry  Sticks 
and  Brufh,  for  the  fpace  of  five  Rods,  that  we 
cou'd  not  pafs,  without  making  fuch  a  Crackth^.^ 
as  we  tho'c  would  alarm  the  Enemy,  and  give 
them  Time  to  cfcape.  But  while  we  were  contri- 
ving to  compafs  our  Defign,  God  in  his  good 
Providence  fo  ordered,  that  a  M^vyfrnaU  Cloud  a- 
rofe,  wIVich  gave  a  fmart  Claf  of  Thunder ^  and  a 
fudden  Shower  of  Rain.  And  thi«  Opportunity 
we  embraced,  to  run  thorow  the  Thicket ;  and 
fo  came  undifcovered  within  fight  olxhzWigvjam; 
and  perceived  by  their  Noife,  that  the  Eucmy 
were  awake.  But  however,  being  unwillinp;  to 
lofe  any  Time,  we  crept  on  our  Hands  and 
Knees  nil  we  were  within  three  or  four  Rods  of 

them- 


(     XX    ) 

them.  Then  we  arofe,  and  ran  to  die  fide  of 
the  iVigwam,  2ind  fired  in  uvon  them  ;  And  fling- 
ing down  our  Guns,  we  furrounded  them  with 
our  Clubs  and  Hatchets,  and  knockt  down  feveral 
we  met  with.  But  after  all  oui  Diligence,  Two 
of  their  Number  made  their  efcape  from  us :  One 
mortally  wounded,  and  the  other  not  hurt  j  as  we 
afterwards  heard- 

When  we  came  to  look  over  the  flain,  we 
found  [even  dead  upon  the  fpoc :  Six  of  whom 
wcfcalpt,  and  left  the  other  unfcalpt.  (Our  Indi* 
ans  faying,  They  would  give  one  to  the  Countryi 
fmce  we  had  each  of  us  one  ;  and  fo  concluded 
we  (hould  all  be  rich  eno')  When  the  Adion 
was  thus  over,  we  took  our  Scalfs  and  Plunder ; 
fuch  as  Guns,  Skins,  fee.  and  the  Enemies  Canoos ; 
in  which  we  came  down  the  River  about  twelve 
Miles,  by  break  of  Day  ;  and  then  tho't  it  Pru- 
dence to  difmifs  and  break  the  Canoos ;  knowing 
there  were  fome  of  the  Enemy  betwixt  us  and 
Home. 

And  now  all  our  Care  being,  how  to  make  a 
fafe  and  comfortable  Return,  we  firft  lookc  over 
our  Provifion,  and  found  we  had  not  more  than 
cno'  for  one  fmall  Refrefliment :  and  being  above 
one  hundred  Miles  from  any  Enfrlifh  Settlement, 
We  Wore  very  tho'tful  how  we  fhou'd  fubfifl:  by 
the  xvay.  For  having  trackt  about  Ihirty  of  the 
Enemy  a  little  before  us,  we  could  not  hunt  for 
our  Subfiftance,  for  fear  of  Difcovery  :  And  fo 
Were  obliged  to  eat  Buds  of  Trees,  Grafi,  ^  Straw 
berry  Leaves,  for  the  fpace  of  four  or  five  Days, 
til,  thro'  the  goodnefs  of  Gad,  we  fafeiy  arrived 
at  Northampton,  on  the  I2th  or  20th  of  the  afore-

faid  June,  And  fome  time  after  (upon  our  humble 
Petition  to  the  Great  and  General  Court,  to  confi- 
der  the  Service  we  had  done)  We  received  Thirty 
eve  Pounds  ReWard.  And  I  have  only  this  to  ob- 
ferve,  that  in  Confequence  of  this  Aftion,  the 
Enemy  were  generally  alarm *d,  and  immediately 
forfook  their  Fort  and  Corn  at  Cowajfuck,  and 
never  returned  to  this  Day,  that  We  cou'd  hear  of, 
to  renew  their  Settlement  in  that  place. 

I  beg  the  Countr/s  leave  to  obferve,  Uov^poorlj 
this  bold  Aftion,  and  great  Service  was  rewarded : 
No  doubt  they  looked  for,  and  well  deferved, 
tight  times  as  much ;  and  now  the  Trovince  Would 
readily  pay  eight  hundred  pounds  in  the  like 
Cafe :  But  a  gracious  God  has  recompenced  to 
the  Elder,  I  truft,  both  in  the  Bleffings  of  his  Pro- 
vidence and  Grace. 

The  French  in  Canada  were  now  forming  ano- 
ther defign  on  North  Hampton,  of  which  we  had 
Seafonable  Advice;  Yet  two  Men  were  kiil'd  go- 
ing to  Deerfield.  After  that  came  in  a  French  dc- 
ferter,  who  informed  of  the  State  of  the  Army 
that  was  then  coming  :  Upon  this,  Exprefles  &amp; 
Scouts  were  every  way  fent  to  obferve  their  Mo- 
tion ;  Major  Whiting  with  a  confiderable  Num- 
ber went  to  the  Ponds,  where  he  expeded  to 
give  them  Battle,  but  they  were  gone  from 
thence,  leaving  their  Cannoos  behind,  which  he 
burnt.  Their  whole  Body  were  feven  hundred, 
with  two  Fryers,  under  the  Command  of  Moun- 
freur  Botcore,  who  in  their  March  began  to  Mu- 
ting about  the  Plunder,  which  they  had  in  View 
&amp;  expc^ed  to  be  mafter  off:  Forgetting  the  Pro- 
verb 


verb  about  dividing  the  Skin  before  the  Bear  was 
killM.  Their  Diffention  at  lad  was  fo  great, 
that  upwards  of  two  hundred  return'd  in  difcoir 
tenc  However  the  reft  came  on,  and  fent  Scouts 
before  to  obferve  the  Pofturc  of  the  Englifh^  who 
reported,  that  they  were  as  thick  as  ihe  Trees  in 
the  Woods.  Upon  which  their  Spirits  faiTd,  &amp; 
more  of  their  number  deferted.  They  then  callM  a 
Council  of  War,  who  refolved  to  defift  from  the 
Enterprize.  Yet  fomeftaid,and  afterwards  fell  on 
Lancafier,  and  Groaton^  where  they  did  fome  Spoil, 
but  not  what  they  expeded,  for  that  thefe  Towns 
were  feafonably  ftrengthened. 

Capr.  Ting  and  Capt.  How  entertained  a  warm 
difpute  with  them  for  fome  time,  but  being  much 
inferiour  in  Number,  were  forced  to  retreat  with 
fome  lofs  I  yet  thofe  that  were  Slain  of  the  Ene- 
my, were  more  then  thofe  of  ours.  One  of  them 
was  an  Officer  of  fome  Diftindion,  which  fo  Ex- 
afperared  their  Spirits,  that  in  revenge  they  {\^^\ 
the  Meeting  Houfe,  kill'd  feveral  Cattle,  and 
burnt  many  Out-houfes-  About  the  fame  time 
Capt.  Allen  from  We[lfi&lt;ld  difcovered  a  fmall  Par- 
tie  with  whom  he  had  a  Skirmifii,  and  loft  one 
Man,  but  kili'd  three,  and  refcued  a  Captive. 
After  this,  between  Haduy  and  ^abaug,  we  had 
one  wounded  and  another  Slain,  By  this  time 
came  Major  Tailor  with  his  Troop,  (  who  always 
diftinguifh't  himfelf  of  an  aAive  Spirit  to  ferve 
his  Country  )  Capt.  ?refcot,  Buckley,  and  IVtUard 
with  their  Companies,  who  were  fo  vigorous  and 
inten(e  in  purfuing  the  Enemy,  that  they  put 
them  all  to  tlighr.  *  And  yet  a  little  while  after 
they  fell  on  Qroaton,  and  NaJhaTi^a/i  where  they 

kill  a 


kill'd  Lieut.  WyUvy  and  feveral  more*  It  was  nok 
then  known  how  many  of  the  Enemy  were  Haijij 
it  being  cuftomary  among  them  to  carry  off  their 
Dead  :  However  it  was  afterward  affirm'd,  that 
they  loft  fixteen  befides  fevera!  that  were  wound* 
ed.  After  this  they  divided  into  fmalier  Parties, 
and  did  much  Mifchief,  as  at  Aimshury^  Haverhill 
and  Exeter '  Augufl  nth.  they  wounded  Mark 
Giles  of  Dover,  (  with  his  Son  )  who  thro'  anguiCh 
of  Pain,  and  much  efFufion  of  Blood,  expired  a 
few  days  after-  At  the  fame  time  another  Partie 
fell  on  Yorky  where  they  flew  Matthew  Aufsin  near 
the  Garrifon,  and  then  went  to  Oyfler  River, 
where  they  kill'd  feveral  while  at  Work  in  theic 
Field. 

The  five  Nations  of  hJtans  which  are  called 
by  the  Name  of  the  Ontydesy  Omondaget,  Cayonges^ 
Seimeches,  and  Mactfuaus,  all  this  while  flood  Neu- 
ter :  But  being  like  co  be  influenced  by  the  Frenth 
M'ijjionaries  Who  came  among  them.  Colonel 
Townfend  and  Mr.  Leverett  from  the  MaJJachufetts, 
Cape.  Gold  and  Capt.  Levlnjtm  from  Cotme^icut, 
Were  Commiffionated  to  give  them  a  Vifir^  and 
ftrengthen  the  Alliance  with  them;  which  they 
did  to  fo  good  EfFed,  that  they  promised  to  take 
up  the  Htf;ci&amp;«,  whenever  the  Governour  o^  New* 
Tork  (hould  defire  it.  But  why  fo  fair  an  Oppor* 
tunity  Was  loft,  when  the  Intereft  of  New-Eng* 
land  lay  bleeding,  was  matter  of  Surprize  and 
Admiration  to  fome,  of  Cenfures  and  Refiedions 
to  others.  The  only  Account  we  can  give  of  it 
IS,  the  vaft  Trade  between  the  Dtitcb  anS  Irkiians; 
for  (he  fake  of  which,  that  Government  have 
always  chofen  co  reftrain  their  Indians  from  joya- 
E  ing

ing  with  us  in  our  Wars.  In  the  midft  of  War, 
there  feems  a  fccret  League  between  them  and 
th&amp;GowQvncmr  of  Canada^  not  to  fuffer  thckaft 
breach  to  be  made  on  one  another  by  any  of  cheic 
Indians. 

But  although  my  Defign  was  only  to  remark 
che  barbarous  Infults  of  thofe  bloody  Pagans  on 
the  Territories  of  New;.  Ew^/^«i;  yet  I  think  it 
not  improper  to  take  a  (hort  view  of  their  De* 
fcent  on  Newfoundland^  confidering  the  nearnefs 
of  irs  Scituation,  and  that  feveral  of  our  Eafiward 
Indians  were  confederate  with  them. 

On  the  1 8th  of  Augufl,  one  hundred  and  forty 
Frtnch  and  Indians,  in  two  Sloops,  early  in  the 
Morning,  from  Placentia,  arrived  at  Bonovifi,  and 
furpHzcd  the  Vembrnk  GaUey,  the  Society  of  Pool^ 
and  a  leffer  Veffel,  in  which  was  thirty  Ton  of 
OH ;  Capt.'  GiU  of  Charlepum  was  there  at  the 
feme  time,  in  a  Ship  of  fourteen  Guns,  with 
twenty  four  Men.  He  was  furioufly  attackt,  but 
defended  himfelf  with  great  Courage  and  good 
ConduA,  from  diverfe  bold  and  defperate  At- 
tempts which  they  made  upon  him.  When  he 
had  beat  *em  at  fmali  Arms,  they  then  brought 
the  Gafley  to  bear  upon  him  with  her  gt^at 
Guns,  whidh  he  rerorn^d  in  the  like  Language. 
They  then  fet  Fire  to  the  Society,  with  an  ex- 
pectation of  burning  him  alWe  5  but  the  Wind 
proving  contrary,  drove  her  afltore  on  a  Rock, 
where  (he  foon  confumed.  They  then  fet  the 
lefferShip  on  Fire,  which  burnt  to  fuch  a  degree, 
by  rcafon  of  the  Oil,  that  it  would  foon  nave 
devoured  him^  had  not  the  Buoy-rope  of  the 
Anchor  got  boc^^n  the  Rudder  and  the  Stern,  ^nd

Kept  off  the  blazing  War  from  him.  The  fdtuation 
of  the  Fort  was  fuch,  as  thac  it  was  not  able  to 
prote^  the  Town  of  St.  Johns ;  upon  which  it 
was  wholly  laid  in  Afties,  the  Inhabitants  being 
moftly  fled  into  the  Woods.  The  lofs  that  Capt. 
Gill  fuftained  in  the  whole  Encounter,  was  but 
one  Man  (lain  and  two  wounded* 

I  now  return  to  the  Weftward,  where  on  the 
29th  of  OSioher,  the  Enemy  did  fome  Mifchief. 
Lattcafier  was  aiarm'd^  and  the  Alarm  was  a  means 
of  the  untimely  Death  of  the  Reverend  Mr.  Gar^ 
Jinn,  their  worthy  Paftor.  Several  of  the  Inha- 
bitants, who  belonged  to  the  Garrifon,  were  wea- 
ried by  hard  Travelling  the  Day  before,  in  puc- 
fuit  of  the  Enemy.  This  caufed  this  good  Man 
out  of  Pity  and  Compaflion,  to  Watch  that  Night 
himfelf;  accordingly  he  went  into  the  Box, 
which  lay  over  the  Ranker,  where  he  ftaid  till 
late  in  the  Night :  But  being  cold,  (as  was  fup* 
pofed)  he  was  coming  down  to  warm  himfelf; 
when  one  between  Sleeping  and  Waking,  or 
furpriz'd  thro'  excefs  of  Fear,  fir'd  upon  him,  as 
he  was  coming  out  of  the  Watch  houfe  ;  where 
no  Man  could  rationally  exped  the  coming  of  an 
Enemy* 

Mr.  Gardiner,  altho'  he  was  ffaot  through  the 
Back,  came  to  the  Door  and  bid  them  open  itj 
for  he  was  wounded.  No  fooner  did  he  enter, 
Imt  he  fainted  awav  :  As  he  came  to  himfelf,  he 
asked  who  it  was  that  fliot  him  i  and  when  they 
cold  him,  he  prayM  God  to  forgive  him,  and  for- 
gave him  himfelf,  believing  that  he  did  it  not  on 
purpofe  5  and  with  a  compofed  frame  of  Spiric, 
defired  them  that  bewailed  him  not  to  weep,  hue 
E  2  pray 


(  ^8  ) 

pray  for  him,  and  his  Flock-  He  comforted 
his  forrowful  Spoufe,  and  expired  wirhin  an  hour. 

The  Indian  Harveft  being  now  gathered,  and 
the  Winter  approaching,  the  Enemy  like  Beafts 
of  Prey,  retired  to  their  private  Cells :  But  con- 
cluding it  neceffary  to  difcover  their  Head  quar- 
ters, it  was  refolved,  that  Col.  Hilton,  with  two 
hundred  and  feventy  Men,  (hould  go  to  NarUg- 
walk  with  twenty  Days  Provifion :  At  which 
time  the  Country  appeared  like  a  frozen  Lake, 
the  Snow  four  foot  deep ;  yet  neither  Officers 
nor  Soldiers  were  in  the  leaft  difcouraged ;  but 
when  they  came  unto  the  Fort,  could  not  difco- 
ver the  leaft  ftep  of  an  Indian,  only  a  few  defer- 
ted  Wigwams^  and  a  large  Chappel,  with  a  Veflry 
at  the  end  of  it,  which  they  fet  on  fire- 

The  Winter  Seafon  requiring  Snow-fims,  an 
Exprefs  was  fent  Col.  Tatrick  to  fupply  the 
Frontiers  therewith, which  he  no  fooner  forward- 
ed, but  the  Exprefs  was  intercepted,  by  a  Mount- 
Real  Scout,  who  fobb'd  him  of  Fift^  Pounds  that 
he  had  in  his  Pocket,  which  at  their  return  they 
prefented  to  the  Governour,  who  converted  it 
mto  a  Bern//,  and  called  it  by  the  Name  of  the 
^eW' England  Gift. 

Early  in  the  Spring,  Capt.  Larralfy  v^gts  order- 
ed to  Cruife  on  the  Shore  of  L*  Accadia^  and  de- 
feat the  French  from  their  Fifliery,  having  Wlale^ 
Boats  to  attend  him  :  Capt-  Fowl  was  alfo  dif- 
patcbt  in  a  Sloop  of  War,  who  on  the  North- 
ward  of  Cafe^SahUs  took  a  fmall  VefTel  formerly 
belonging  to  the  Englifh^  which  had  Cattle  and 
Sheep  on  Board  her-  Soon  after  he  took  five 
Prifoners  at  P9rt  Rofua^  and  three  at  L'  Ha-ve, 

burnt 


(^9) 
burnt  a  few  Houfes,  and  kill'd  fome  Cattle ;  but 
the  Inhabitants  were  fo  miferabiy  poor,  and  their 
Circumftances  fo  defperate,  that  they  rather 
chofe  to  be  Prifoners  among  the  Engllfj,  than  at 
Liberty  among  the  French. 

May  the  4th.  1709.  Capt-  Hill,  who  was  for- 
merly taken  at  Wells,  and  carried  to  Canada,  was 
from  thence  fent  by  Mounfieur  Vaudriell,  to  con- 
cert the  exchange  of  Prifoners,  who  advis'd  of 
one  hundred  and  feventeen  that  were  then  with 
him,  and  about  feventy  more  with  the  Indians ; 
which  unexpe&lt;5bed  News  was  very  reviving  to  the 
dejeded  Spirits  of  their  mournful  Friends ,  confi- 
dering  the  many  Deaths  they  efcaped  in  their 
Captivity. 

Upon  the  advice  hereof,  Capt;  Levin/Ion  was 
fent  to  Canada  to  capitulate  about  the  matter,  and 
after  him  Capt.  Appleton,  and  Mr.  Sheldon  (  with 
feventy  Prifoners  of  theirs  )  who  went  by  Water, 
having  ordered  a  Scout  before  of  ten  Men  by 
Land  to  advife  of  their  coming,  that  fo  our  Pri- 
foners might  be  in  readinefs.  But  the  JefuUs  and 
Fryer/ had  by  this  time  fo  influenc'd  the  Cover- 
nour,  as  to  caufe  him  to  break  his  Word  of  Ho- 
nour, pretending,  that  as  the  Indians  were  inde- 
pendant  and  a  free  born  People,  that  he  had  no 
power  to  demand  any  Captives  of  tliem  ;  when 
at  the  fame  time  they  were  fo  much  in  Subjcdi- 
on,  and  Vaffalage  unto  him,  that  they  never  for- 
med an  Enterprize  without  him,  neither  did  they 
dare  to  attempt  it  without  his  knowledge. 

Now  alcho'  thcExpence  and  Induftry  of  our 
Commiflioners  in  this  Affair  was  very  great  ;  yet 
notwithftanding   they   could   not   obtain  above 

fixty 


C  30  ) 

frxty  Captives  out  of  one  hundred  and  eighty  fc* 
vcn  ;  which  was  fcandaloufly  bafe  and  diftio- 
nourable  in  that  Government. 

The  defcent  that  the  Enemy  again  made  on 
2v«f^'  fcundUnd,  was  more  terrible  and  furprizing 
than  the  former  ;  for  on  January  21ft.  at  break  of 
day,  Mounfieur  Sttpercafi,  Governour  ofTlacentUf 
came  with  five  hundred  and  fifty  French  from  Ca- 
nada, Fort' Royal,  and  other  places  adjacent,  and  a 
company  of  Salvages,  of  whom  Affacomhuit  was 
Chief;  who  ranfack'd  and  laid  wafte  ail  the  Sow 
ihtrn  Settlements  in  a  few  Days,  and  then  fell  on 
St.  Johns,  where  in  the  fpace  of  two  hours  all 
were  become  Prifoners  of  War,  excepting  thofe 
in  the  Cattle  and  Fort.  The  Night  before  the 
Enterprize  they  were  obliged  to  lye  on  a  Bed  of 
Snow,  fix  foot  deep,  for  fear  of  being  difcovercd, 
which  caufed  fuch  cold  and  numbnefs  in  the 
Joynts  of  feveral,  that  the  General  vow'd  revenge, 
and  accordingly  Executed  his  Refentment,  for 
that  he  dcftroy'd  all  before  him,  and  gave  no 
Quarter  for  feme  time ;  till  Mounfieur  Boocore, 
who  was  a  Gentleman  of  more  Humanity,  did  in- 
tcrpofe  and  abate  his  Fury :  The  Number  that 
they  took  alive  was  one  hundred  and  forty, 
whom  they  fent  unto  the  Garrifon,  not  out  of 
pity  to  the  Prifoners,  but  with  a  defign  to  Starve 
the  whole.  After  that  they  laid  clofe  feige  to  the 
Garrifon^  and  Fort,  which  continued  thirty  Days 
without  relief.  (Excepting  three  who  made  their

In  the  Fort  were  only  forty  Men  under  the  com- 
mand of  Capt.  Mood),  and  twelve  in  the  Caftle, 
under  Capt.  Loibam ;  who   behaved  thcmfelves 

with 


(30 

With  fuch  bravery,  that  they  {lighted  all  manner 
of  renders  that  were  made  them  of  Surrendring, 
wi(h  the  higheft  Contempt  immaginable. 

Upon  this  the  Enemy  committed  many  Barba- 
rities and  fent  feveral  threatnings  ;  but  they  had 
no  Influence  eirlier  on  Officers  or  Soldiers,  for 
they  piy'd  their  Bombs  and  Morrarpieces  to  fo 
good  EiFe&lt;ft,  that  they  kill'd  feveral,  and  loft  but 
three  in  the  whole  Engagement. 

After  this  they  Steer'd  to  CoTsfumphm-B^y^  hav- 
ing ftrft  demolifh't  all  the  English  Settlements  in 
trinity  and  Bonivifi,  where  they  burnt  their  Sta- 
ges and  Boars,  and  laid  a  Contribution  befides 
upon  the  Inhabitants.  From  thence  they  went 
to  Carhoneer^  where  they  met  with  fome  repulfe, 
and  finding  their  Provifion  fall  (hort,  they  fent  a 
further  number  unto  the  Fort,  referving  the  rnoft 
skilful  and  able  Fifhermen  for  themfelres  until  the 
fucceeding  Spnng. 

During  this  time  our  Frontiers  at  home  were 
greatly  infefted.  At  Spruce-Creek  in  Kittery  they 
kiird  five  and  took  as  many  more  ;  among  the 
Slain  was  Mrs.  Hoely  a  Gentlewoman  of  good  Ex- 
traA,  and  Education  ;  but  the  greateft  Suif«ircr 
was  Enoch  Hutcbins  in  the  lofs  of  his  Wife  and 
Children.  Three  weeks  after  John  Rogers  was 
dangeroufiy  wounded,  and  at  a  little  diftance 
James  Toby  was  (hot  by  another  Party.  From 
thence  they  went  IVefiwardy  and  took  a  Shallop 
which  belong'd  to  tifcatacjtta.  Our  Sea  coalt  at 
the  fame  time  was  difrefted  by  Vrivateers,  parti- 
cularly by  Capt-  Crepoa,  who  notwichftandin^s; 
our  Cruifcrs  that  were  then  our,  took  feven  Ve('- 
fels,  bef»des  a  Sloop,  and  carried  them  all  to  Pore- 

Royal,

Royal,  excepting  the  latter,  which  was  retaken 
by  Capt.  Harnj  at  Richmond's  Ifland. 

About  the  fame  time  Michael  Royal,  a  Fifher- 
man  belonging  to  MarhUbead,  as  he  went  alhore 
for  wood  off  of  Cape  Sables,  was  Barbaroufly  cut 
iijpeices;  On  the  i^-th.  of  0&lt;5?o^tfr  following, 
eighteen  Indians  fell  on  Cape  Neddick,  where  they 
took  four  Children  of  Mr«  Stovers  at  a  little  dif- 
tance  from  the  Garrifon.  The  youngeft  not  a- 
ble  to  travel  was  knock't  on  the  head,  the  other 
three  were  carried  Captive  5  but  being  attack'c 
by  Lieuc.  March,  and  loofing  one  of  their  Com- 
pany, they  kill'd  a  fecond  Child  in  way  of  re- 
venge. 

During  the  Winter  little  or  no  Spoil  was  done 
on  any  of  our  Frontiers ;  the  Enemy  being  Co 
terrified  by  reafon  of  Snowjhoes  (  which  moft  of 
our  Men  were  skilful  in  )  that  they  never  attemp- 
ted coming  at  fuch  a  feafon  after. 

But  as  the  Spring  came  on,  April  27th-  1706. 
a  fmall  Body  fell  on  an  Out-houfe  in  Oyfier-River, 
where  they  killM  eight,  and  wounded  two  ;  The 
Garrifon  which  ftood  near,  had  not  a  Man  in  it, 
at  that  time ;  but  the  Women,  who  affamM  an 
Amaz^onian  Courage  (eeing  nothing  but  Death  be- 
fore them,  advanced  the  Watch-box,  and  made  an 
Alarm.  They  put  on  Hatts,  with  their  Hair 
hanging  down,  and  fired  fo  briskly  that  they 
ftruck  a  terror  in  the  Enemy,  and  they  withdrew, 
without  firing  the  houfe,  or  carrying  away  much 
Plunder.  The  principal  Sufferer  at  this  time 
was  John  IVheeUr^  who  thinking  them  to  be  friend 
hidianty  unh;ippily  fell  under  their  Fury.  Two 
days  after  Mr.  ShapUigb  and  his  Son,  as  they  were 

travel-

traveijing  thro'  Ktttery,  Were  ambufht  by  anothet 
Party,  who  killing  the  Facher,  took  the  Son,  and 
carried  him  to  Canada*  In  their  March  they 
were  fo  inhumanely  Gruel,  that  they  hit  off  the 
tops  of  his  Fingers,  and  to  ftagnate  the  Blood, 
fear*d  them  with  hot  Tobacco  Pipes. 

j^««e  the  I  ft  Mr.  Walker ^  being  loaden  with 
Provifions  UomConneBlcut^  was  chafed  by  %  French 
Privateer,  which  to  avoid  he  ran  afhorc  in  his 
Boat,  and  as  he  haftned  to  Road-IJl^nd^  made  aa 
Alarm  ail  round :  The  Government  there  was 
fo  expeditious,  that  in  a  few  Hours  (by  beat  of 
Drum)  one  hundred  Men  well  equip'd  voluntari- 
ly entred  on  board  of  two  Sloops,  under  the 
command  of  Major  Wanton  and  Captain  ^awe^ 
who  next  Day  became  Mafters  of  the  Prize*. 
wherein  were  thirty  feven  Men,  under  the  com- 
mand of  Capt.  Ferret,  bound  for  Port-Royal^  but 
in  his  way  was  obliged  to  cruife  on  the  Ndxt;- 
England  Coaft. 

The  Year  after  they  did  another  brave  Ex- 
ploit, in  taking  a  Sloop  from  Flacentia,  with  four 
Guns,  four  Patteraroes,  and  forty  nitie  Men, 
which  undoubtedly  prevented  great  Mifchiet 
that  otherwife  would  have  befallen  us. 

Upon  the  Advice  of  many  En^lljl  Captives 
that  were  now  at  Port-Royal,  Captain  Rou/e  of 
Charlefiown  was  fent  with  a  Flag  of  Truce  ^  who 
after  an  unufual  ftay,  returned  but  wich  feven- 
teen,  faying,  that  the  French  detained  th^m.  He 
fell  under  a  fevere  fufpicion  of  carrying  on  a  fe- 
cret  Trade  with  the  Enemy ,  which  grew  upon 
his.  fecond  going,  when  ho  brought  but  feven 
back  with  him.

The  General  /&gt;S]emhly  which  was  then  fitcing, 
with  the  Country  throughout,  were  thrown 
hereby,  into  a  great  Ferment ;  confidering  the 
vaft  Charge  and  Effufion  of  Blood.  He  was  In- 
dided  for  Trayterous  Correfpondcnce  with  the 
Enemy.  Others  at  the  fame  time,  like  Snakes  in 
the  Grafs,  or  Moles  under  Ground,  were  as  in* 
duftrious  to  evade  it,  and  to  put  a  different  Glofs 
on  all  his  Anions-

And  yet  it  has  been  generally  remarked  from 
the  beginning  of  Time  here,  that  thofe  who  liave 
been  Indian-Traders ,  and  feemingly  got  much, 
have  fenfibly  decayed,  and  many  of  them  become 
Victims  to  their  bloody  Cruelty.  A  Proclamatlan 
was  iffued  forth  to  apprehend  all  fuch  as  were 
Sufpeded  ;  Several  hereupon  were  feized,  and  o- 
thcrs  vehemently  SufpCifled,  who  did  what  they 
could  to  extenuate  the  Crime,  and  to  get  the  In- 
didm^nt  alter'd  from  that  of  Treafon,  unto  High 
Mif demeanour.  At  laft  a  Court  of  Oyer  and  Termi- 
ner was  callM,  and  Fines  were  impofed,  be- 
fides  the  Prifon  Fees. 

How  far  thefe  unhappy  Meafures  tended  to  in 
creafe  our  Troubles,  is  Obvious  to  an  impartial 
Eye,  if  we  confider  how  they  fupply'd  the  Ene* 
my  with  Powder,  Shot,  Iron,  Nails,  and   other 
Materials  of  War. 

The  Advice  of  Collonel  Sc^i/^/er  from  time  to 
time  was  of  eminent  Service  unto  the  Country, 
who  advjs'd  of  two  hundred  and  feventy  Men  that 
were  coming  upon  us.  Their  firft  defcent  was 
on  Dnnfiablc,  the  third  of  &gt;//,  where  they  fell  on 

a

&amp;  Garrifon  that  had  twenty  Troopers  poRed  in 
it,  who  by  their  Negh'gence  and  Folly,  keeping 
no  Watch  fuffered  them  to  enter,  which  tended 
to  the  deftrudion  of  one  half  of  their  Number. 
After  that  a  ftnall  Party  attack't  Daniel  Galeucias 
Houfe,  who  held  them  play  for  fome  time,  till  the 
old  Mans  Courage  fail'd  ,•' when  on  furrendring 
himfeif,  he  inform'd  them  of  the  date  of  the  Gar- 
rifon 5  how  that  one  Man  was  kilfd  &amp;  only  two 
Men  and  a  Boy  left ,-  which  caufed  them  to  rally 
a  new,  and  with  greater  Coucage  than  before. 
Upon  which  one  with  the  Boy  got  out  on  the 
back  fide,  leaving  only  Jacob  to  fight  the  Battle, 
who  for  fome  time  defended  himfelf  with  much 
bravery ;  but  over  power'd  with  Force,  and  find- 
ing none  to  affift  him,  was  oblig'd  to  quit  it,  and 
make  his  efcape  as  weH  as  he  could  ^  but  before 
he  got  far,  the  Enemy  laid  hold  of  him  once  and 
again,  and  yet  by  much  ftrugling  he  refcufed  him* 
felf:  Upon  this  they  burnt  the  Houfe,  and  next 
Day  about  forty  more  fell  on  Ameshuryy  where 
ttiey  kiird  eight ;  two,  at  the  fame  time,  who 
were  at  work  in  a  Field,  hearing  an  Out-cry, 
haftned  to  their  Relief ;  but  being  purfued,  ran 
to  a  deferted  Houfe,  in  which  vvere  two  Flan* 
kers,  where  each  of  them  found  an  old  Gun,  but 
neither  of  them  fit  for  Service  ;  and  if  they  were, 
had  neither  Powder  nor  Shot  to  load  with: 
However,  each  took  a  Flanker,  and  made  the 
beft  appearance  they  could,  by  thrufting  the 
Muzzles  of  their  Guns  outfide  the  Port-holes, 
Crying  aloud,  Here  they  are^  hut  do  not  fire  till  they 
eome  nearer ^  which  put  the  Enemy  into  fuch  a 
fright,  that  they  inftantly  drevv  off.

From  thetice  they  went  to  Kingjtown^  where 
they  kiird  and  wounded  feveral  Cattle.  About 
the  fame  time  Jofeph  Englifh,  who  was  a  Friend 
JnJiafiy  going  from  DunftMe  to  Chelmsford,  with 
a  Man  and  his  Wife  on  Horeback,  was  (hot 
deadj,  the  Woman  taken,  but  the  Man  made  his 
efcape.  On  the  8ch  of  Jtilj/y  five  Indians  a  little 
before  Night,  fell  on  an  Out-houfe  in  Reading^ 
where  they  furprizM  a  Woman  with  eight  Chil- 
dren ;  the  former  with  the  three  youngeft  were 
inftantly  difpatcht,  and  the  other  they  carried 
Captive ;  but  one  of  the  Children  unable  to  tra- 
vel, they  knockt  on  the  head,  and  left  in  the 
Swamp,concluding  it  was  dead,  but  a  while  afrer 
it  was  found  alive.  The  Neighbourhood  being 
alarm'd,  got  ready  by  the  Morning,  and  coming 
on  their  Track,  purfued  them  fo  near,  that  they 
recovered  three  of  the  Children,  and  put  the  E- 
uemy  into  fuch  a  Terrour,  that  they  not  only 
quitted  their  Plunder  and  Blankets,  but  the  other 
Captive  alfo.  Several  Strokes  were  afterwards 
Snade  on  Chelmsford^  Sudbury  and  Groton,  where 
three  Soldiers  as  they  were  going  to  publick  Wor- 
(hip&gt;  were  way-laid  by  a  fmail  Party,  who  kiird 
two,  and  made  the  other  a  Prifoner. 

Ac  Exeter  a  Company  of  French  Mohauh,  who 
fome  time  kept  lurking  about  Capt.  Hilton  s  Gar- 
rifon,  took  a  view  of  all  that  went  in  and  our ; 
and  obferving  fome  to  go  with  their  Scythes  to 
mow,  lay  in  amhufh  till  they  laid  by  their  Arms, 
and  while  at  Work,  rufhed  on  at  once,  and  by 
intercepting  them  from  their  Arms,  kill'd  four, 
wounded  one,  and  carried  three  Captive :  So 
that  out  of  tePi  two  only  efcaped,  A  while  af- 
ter, 


(37) 

ter,  two  of  thofe  that  were  t^ken^vizMv-  EJward 
Hall,  and  Samuel  Myals,  made  their  efcape  ;  but 
the  Fatigue  and  Difficulty  that  they  went  thro*, 
(befides  the  terror  and  fear  they  were  under  of 
being  taken)  was  almoft  incredible ;  for  in  three 
weeks  together  they  had  nothing  to  fubfift  on, 
excepting  a  few  Lilly  roots,  and  the  Rhines  of 
Trees. 

Several  of  our  Captives  ftill  remaining  among 
the  French  and  Indians,  occafioned  Mr.,  Sheldon^ 
going  a  fecond  time  to  Canada  with  a  Flag  of 
Truce,  who  at  his  return  brought  forty  five,  and 
had  a  profpe&lt;5t  of  many  more,  but  was  preventftfi 
by  the  Jefuits. 

As  to  the  Treatment  of  our  Captives  with  the 
French,  it  was  as  different  and  various  as  their 
Tempers  and  Confticutions ;  Some  were  mild  and 
pleafant,  while  others  were  morofe  and  fordid  ; 
but  the  Indians  might  as  well  alter  their  Com- 
plexions as  their  Conftitutions ;  for  fcarce  a  Day 
pad  without  feme  ad:  of  Cruelty,  inrofiiuch  that 
all  were  under  a  conftant  Martyrdom  between 
fear  of  Life  and  terror  of  Death. 

It  would  be  an  endlefs  task  to  enumerate  the 
various  Sufferings  that  many  groaned  under,  by 
long  Marching  with  heavy  Burdens,  thro'  heat 
and  cold;  and  when  ready  to  faint  for  wane  of 
Food,  they  were  frequently  knockt  on  the  head  : 
Teeming  Women,  in  cold  Blood,  have  been  npc 
open  ;  others  faftned  to  Stakes,  and  burnt  alive; 
and  yet  the  Finger  of  God  did  eminentiy  appear

Firft.  Of  Reheliab  Taylor,  who  after  her  return 
from  Captivity,  gave  me  the  following  Account. 
viz,. 

That  when  (he  was  going  to  Canada,  on  the 
h^zko^  Mount  Re/a/River,(hewas  violently  infulted 
by  Sampfon  her  bloody  Mailer,  who  without  any 
Provocation  was  refolved  to  hang  her;  and  for 
want  of  a  Rope,  made  ufe  of  his  Girdle,  which 
when  he  had  faftned  about  her  Neck,  attempted 
to  hoife  her  up  on  the  limb  of  a  Tree,  (that  hung 
in  the  nature  of  a  Gihhit)  but  in  hoifing  her,  the 
Weight  of  her  Body  broke  it  afunder ;  which  to 
cxafperated  the  cruel  Tyrant,  that  he  made  a  fe- 
cond  attempt,  refolving  that  if  he  fail'd  in  that, 
to  knock  her  on  the  head :  But  before  he  had 
power  to  effed  it,  Bomafem  came  along,  who 
feeing  the  Tragedy  on  foot,  prevented  the  fatal 
ftroke. 

A  fecond  was  a  Child  of  Mrs.  Hannah  Parfons, 
of  IVellsy  whom  the  Indians  for  want  of  Food,  had 
determined  to  Roaft  alive,  but  while  the  fire  was 
kindling,  and  the  Sacrifice  preparing,  a  Compa- 
ny of  Frevch  Mohauh  came  down  the  River  in  a 
Canoo,  with  three  Dogs,  which  fomewhat  revi- 
ved thefe  hungry  Mortfters,  expeding  to  make  a 
Feaft  upon  one  of  them.  So  foon  as  they  got  afliore, 
the  Child  was  ofTer'd  in  Exchange;  but  defpifing 
the  offer,  they  tcndred  a  Gun,  which  they  readi- 
ly accepted,  arid  by  that  means  the  Child  was 
preferved. 

A  third  was  of  Samuel  ButterfieU,  who  being 
fent  to  Groton  as  a  Soldier,  was  with  others  attackr, 
as  they  were  gathering  in  the  Harveft;  his  bra- 
very was  fuch,  that  he  kill'd  one  and  wounded

which  caufed  matter  of  Lamentation,  and  enrag'd 
them  to  fuch  degree  that  they  vow'd  the  ucmoft 
revenge  ,  Some  were  for  whipping  him  to  Death ; 
others  for   burning    him  alive ;  but  differing  in 
their  Sentiments,  they  fubmitted  the  liTue  to  the 
Squa-w  Widow^  concluding  fhe  would  determine 
fomething   very    dreadful,  but  when  the  mattec 
was  opened,  and  the  Fa&lt;5l  conddered,  her  Spirits

this  Exploit,  it  was  publickly  talkt  of  at  PorffmoHt&amp; 
in  every  Article,  and  with  little  or  no  Variation, 
altho'  ninety  Miles  diftance. 

But  all  this  while  we  were  only  cutting  off  the 
Branches  5  the  French  in  Canada,  and  Nova  Scotia^ 
who  fupply  the  Indians  wifh  all  necellarys  for  the 
Waft  Were  the  Root  of  all  our  Woe. 

Wherefore  it  was  refolved  to  make  an  EnCef-

March  i;th.  1707  they  fail'd  from  Nantaslet, 
and  in  a  fortnight  after,  arrived  at  Vort  Royal  Gut, 
where  they  landed  on  both  fides  the  River, 
which  the  Enemy  obferving,  made  an  alarm  and 
retired  to  the  Forr,  with  what  Subftance  they 
could  get. 

Monfieur  Supercafs^  who  was  the  Governour, 
upon  rallying  his  Forces  together,  held  afhort 
SkirmilBi  but  finding  too  warm  a  Reception,  (his 
Horfe  being  fliot  under  him)  was  obliged  to  re- 
treat.  A  Council  of  War  being  called,  it  was  rc- 
folv'd  chat  the  Artillery  fliould  be  landed,  and 
their  Lines  forced  ;  But  thro'  the  Unfaithfulnefs 
of  feme,  and  cowardly  Pretentions  of  others,  lit-

Ground,  and  not  fired  a  Gun,  the  Enemy  muft 
of  neceffity  have  furrendred  or  have  ftarved- 
This  was  fo  furprifing,  that  the  whole  Country 
was  under  an  amazing  Ferment,  and  the  Com- 
mander fo  grofly  reflefted  on,  that  his  Spirits 
funk,  and  he  became  of  little  Service  ever  after : 
Yet  to  give  him  his  Charader,  he  was  a  Man  of 
good  Courage,  and  a  true  lover  of  his  Country. 
But  the  Bufinefs  that  he  undertook,  was  too 
weighty  for  his  Shoulders  to  bear.  So  foon  as 
his  Excellency  was  apprized  hereof,  (who  had  the 
Honour  and  Interefl  of  his  Country  much  at 
Heart)  he  fent  Rnd  Orders  to  ftay  them  i  and 
another  Ship  of  War,  with  two  Companies  of 
frefli  Men  to  reinforce  them ;  Col.  Hutchinfcn, 
Col.  Townfifid^  and  Mr*  Leverett  were  appointed 
Commiflioners,  to  give  the  greater  Vigour :  But 
the  number  of  Deferters,  and  difaffeeted  Officers 
overthrew  the  whole  Affair.  However  a  fecond 
Attempt  was  made,  which  the  Enemy  perceiv- 
ing, called  in  their  Auxiliaries  both  of  French  and 
Indians  from  Menif^  SacbeneSo,  and  ail  other  place$ 
adjacent.  A  Privateer  and  fome  other  VeflfeU 
had  aifo  arrived  fince  the  withdraw  of  our  Forces. 
By  their  Affiftance  the  Enemy  had  not  only 
ftrengthned  the  Fort,  but  fecured  their  Lines  ; 
fo  that  nothing  could  be  well  attempted  but  by 
a  few  Encounters  ^  in  which  Major  IValton  beha- 
ved himfeif  with  much  Bravery,  being  the  only 
Field-OtScer  then  aftiorej  who  engaged  them 
fome  time,  and  at  lad  put  them  to  fj'ghr,  kitting 
and  wounding  feveral,  among  whom  was  the 
Field- Major.  Thofe  that  fell  on  our  fide  were 
fixteen,  and  as  many  more  wounded.  Our  Fron- 
G  a  tiers

tiers  at  home  were  as  much  difrefted  as  ever  t 
Majt  ltd  they  took  two  at  Oyfier.River^  and  on 
3Fi«fe  i2th  kill'd  one  ^tGroton;  After  that  they 
flew  H^ittUm  Carpenter  of  Kittery^  with  his  whole 
Family.  jF«/y  8rh  they  way  laid  a  Cart  with 
two  Men,  as  they  were  going  from  D»ver  to 
Oyfier-River^  whom  they  (hot  dead,  Capt.  Sumerf^ 
by,  who  was  there  with  his  Troop,  regained 
the  moft  of  the  Plunder  that  they  took.  About 
the  fame  time  Stephen  G'tlman  and  Jacob  his  Bro- 
ther, as  they  were  riding  from  Exeter  to  Kwgfiown, 
were  ambufli'd  by  another  Party.  The  firft  had 
his  Horfe  fiiot  under  him,  and  was  in  danger  of 
being  fcalpr  before  he  could  get  clear ;  The  o- 
ther  Brother  had  feveral  Shot  thro'  his  Cloaths, 
and  one  that  graz'd  his  Belly ;  his  Horfe  alfo  was 
wounded ;  yer  he  defended  himfelf  on  Foot,  and 
got  into  the  Garnfon. 

At  Cafco  the  Indians  intercepted  a  Fifliing-boat 
as  (he  was  failing  between  the  Iflands,  in  which 
were  five  Men,  three  of  whom  they  kill'd,  and 
took  the  other  two.  Augufi  the  loth  they  way- 
laid the  Road  between  Tork  and  Wells,  and  as 
four  Horfemen  were  riding  in  Company  with 
Mrs,  LitttefieU^  who  had  the  value  of  Sixty  Pound's 
with  her,  were  all  flain  except  one,  who  made 
his  efcape.  Another  Company  falling  on  Marl* 
horou^b^  encompalTed  two  as  they  were  at  work 
in  the  Field ;  one  of  which  got  clear,  and  the 
Neighbourhood  meeting  together,  engaged  them 
fo  fmartly,  that  the  Enemy  gave  way,  leaving 
twenty  four  Packs  behind  ;  which  fo  exafperated 
their  Spirits,  with  the  lofs  they  fuftained,  that 
they  flew  the  Captive  which  they  bad  taken.  On 

our 


C  4f  &gt; 

our  fide  two  were  flain,  and  two  wounded. 

At  Exeter  one  was  kill'd  near  the  Meeting- 
houfe  ;  and  two  days  after  another  at  Kingfiown, 
but  the  moft  affiliating  ftroke  that  befell  us  this 
feafonwasat  Oyfier  River y  whtre  thirty  French 
Mobauks,  who  appeared  like  fo  many  Furys  with 
their  naked  Bodys  painted  like  Blood,  and  obferv- 
f ng  fome  at  work  in  hewing  of  Timber,  and  o- 
thers  driving  the  Team,  they  violently  fell  upon 
them  with  fuch  hideous  Noife  and  Yelling,  as 
made  the  very  Woods  to  eccho.  At  the  firft  (hot 
they  killM  fevenand  mortally  wounded  another, 
upon  which  Capt-  Chefy  (  who  had  fignaily  be- 
haved himfelf  in  many  Encounters)  with  the  few 
that  were  left,  fired  on  them  with  great  vigour 
and  refolution  ;  aud  for  fome  time  gave  a  check 
to  their  Triumphing ;  but  the  Enemy  being  too 
powerful,  foon  overcame  him,  to  the  great  la- 
mentation of  all  that  knew  him. 

It  being  now  the  height  of  Indian  Harveft,  they 
difperft  themfelves,  into  all  parts,  and  did  confi- 
derable  Mifchief ;  but  having  fomthing  more  then 
ordinary  in  view,  they  befet  Winter^Harhour,  and 
on  September  2ifi,  with  one  hundred  and  fifty 
Men  in  fifty  Canoos,  Attempted  the  taking  two 
Shallops  as  they  lay  at  Anchor,  in  which  werq 
Capt.  Aufiiny  Mr.  Harmony  Sergeant  Cole^  and  five 
Men  more,  with  a  Boy  5  who  perceiving  their 
Intention,  fufFer'd  them  to  paddle  tiH  they  had  got 
near,  and  then  fired,  which  put  them  into  great: 
Confufion.  But  they  foon  recovered  themfelves 
&amp;  fir'd  on  our  Men  with  fuch  refolution,  as  made 
them  to  quit  one  of  their  Boats,  by  cutting  theic 
toads  and  lalhings  j  5n4  no  foon^r  had  they  taken

poffeflRon  thereof,  but  they  got  their  Mainfail 
atrip,  before  that  our  Men  could  get  up  theirs 
half  Maft  high,  and  then  put  out  their  Oars, 
which  they  joyn'd  with  Paddles  on  each  fide  j 
but  having  no  fargood,  and  their  Boat  a  dull  fai- 
lor,  ours  gained  on  them  fo  much,  that  thejy  got 
twelve  or  thirteen  Canoos  a  head,  with  Filhing- 
lines  to  tow  them.  But  a  breeze  fpringing  up,  &amp; 
the  Enemy  making  too  near  the  Wind,  (  for  want 
of  a  fargood  )  came  to  flays  feveral  times,  in  fo 
much  that  they  fell  a  quarter  of  a  Mile  a  ftern. 
But  the  reft  of  the  Canoos  kept  on  firing,  and 
our  Men  on  them  for  a  confiderable  time  toge- 
ther. The  only  Man  we  loft  was  Benjamin  Dani- 
el, who  was  fliot  thro'  the  Bowels  foon  after 
they  came  to  fail ;  At  his  fall  he  faid,  ^^  I  ama 
Jead  Man  !  yet  recovering  himfelf  a  littie  added, 
•*  Let  me  kill  one  before  I  dye  /  but  he  had  not 
ftrength  to  fire. 

The  Engagement  held  about  three  hours,  in 
M»hich  the  Englif}  fpent  five  pounds  of  Powder,  &amp; 
when  the  Enemy  ceafed  their  chafe,  they  had  not 
above  one  quarter  of  a  pound  left.  The  Iniiant 
were  fo  bold  and  daring,  as  to  attempt  to  take 
hold  of  the  blades  of  their  Oars,  as  they  were 
rowing.  The  number  of  them  that  fell  was  then 
unknown^  becaufe  of  a  continued  Cloud  of 
Smoke ;  but  it  was  affirmed,  that  nine  were  Slain, 

and  twice  as  many  wounded.  ■■         After 

this  a  fmall  Scout  appeared  at  Barwick,  where  they 
kiird  two  as  they  return'd  from  worfhip ;  Upon 
which  fome  of  the  Inhabitants  who  were  acquain- 
ted with  their  walk,  lay  in  wait,  and  making  the 
fifft  difcovery  fired  to  good  advantage  |  which

dropt  their  Packs,  in  which  were  three  Scalps, 
fuppofed  to  be  fome  of  thofe  which  a  h^tle  be- 
fore were  taken  at  Oyfter  River.  The  Win* 
ter  Seafon  afforded  a  little  refpite:  But  on 
April  22.  1708.  Lieut.  Litthfieldo{  Wells ^  with  Jo- 
fepb  Wittrty  as  they  were  travelling  to  Tork,  were 
furrounded  by  a  fm.ill  Body  5  the  latter  made  his 
^fcape,  but  the  other  was  carried  to  Rebeck, 
who  being  a  skilful  Engineer^  cfpccially  in  Watec 
works,  did  them  great  Service. 

About  this  time  eight  hundred  French  and  Inds* 
ans  were  forming  a   defperate  defign  againft  us, 
but  on  a  divifion  among  themfelves  fell    (hort  of 
the  Mifchief  they  defigned    us-     However  one 
hundred  and  fifty  on  Augufi  29th  at  break  cf  day, 
fell  on  Ha'uerhillf  and  pafling    by  the  Garrifons 
got  into   the  very   Center  of  the  Town  before 
they  were   difcovered.    They  attempted  to  fire 
the  Meeting-houfCj  and  after  that  did  burn  feve- 
ral  Houfes  near  it.    Major  Turner^  Cape,  frke,  &amp; 
Capt.  Gardner^  were  happily  there  at   that  time, 
and  rallied  together   what   Forces  they  could  ^ 
but  moft  of  their  Men  being  potted  in  remote 
Garrifons,  were  unable  to  affift  them      However 
with  fuch  as  they  could   get  together,  they  faced 
the  Enemy  with  much  bravery,  and  in  left  than 
an  hour  put  them  all  to  flight,  leaving  nine  of  their 
dead,  and  carrying  off  feveral  that  were  wound- 
ed-    But  the  Slain  on  our  fide  were  thrice  as  ma- 
ny, by  reafon  of  the   furprize  that   they   at  ftrft 
were  in  ;   among  whom  was  the  Reverend  Mr/ 
Kolfh  the  worthy   Minifler  of  that  Town,   with 
Capt,  Wa'imigkt^

A  while  after  James  Hays  of  Amejlur^  was  ta--

Reed  and  Daijid  Hutchins  of  Kittery. 

Collonel  Hilton  again  march'd  toward  their 
Head  quarters  with  one  hundred  and  feventy 
Men  at  Amafaconty,  Tigwacket,  and  other  places 
adjacent ;  but  after  a  long  and  tedious  March 
could  make  no  difcovery* 

On  April  i2ch.  1709.  a  Scout  fell  on  DeerfieU, 
and  took  Mehamen  Hiftfdel,    as  he  was  driving  a 
Cart,  which  was  the  fecopd  time  of  his  Captivi- 
ty.     And  on   May  6th.   another   Party  within 
tnrce  Miles  of  Exeter,  furpriz'd  feveral  as  they 
were  going  to   a  Saw-mi!l,  among   whom  were 
Mr.  IVMam   Moody,  Samuel  Stepbins,  and   two  of 
Mr.  Jeremiah  Oilman  s  Sons,   whom  they  carried 
Captive.     A  few  Days    after  Capt.   Wright  of 
Northampton,  with  feveral  EngUJh,  and  two  Natick 
Indians,  adventuring  to  the  Lake,  within  forty 
miles  of  Fort  La  Motte,  kill'd  and  wounded  two 
or  three  of  the  French  Mahauks  •  anu  on  their  re- 
turn up  /Vc«cA-River,  met  with  another  Body  of 
the  Encmv  in  Canoos,  on  whom  they  fir'd,  and 
overfet,  kill'd  and  wounded  feveral  of  them-    In 
this  Company  was  William  Moody  before  menti- 
oned, who  being  now  alone  with  but  one  Indian 
in  a  Canoo,   was  encouraged   by  the  English  to 
kill  faid  Indian,  and  make  his  efcape.     Which  he 
attempted,  but  overfet  the  Canoo  in  the  ftruggle, 
and  then  Moody  fwam  towards  the  Englijh  for  Re- 
lief. Whereupon  Lieut.  John  Wells,  with  one  or 
two  more,  ran   down  the   Bank  and  helpt  him 
aniorc.     In  the  mean  time  a  number  of  the  Ene- 
my came  to  the  Bank,  and  wounded  John  Strongs

and  kWVd  the  Lieutenant,  who  had  been  a  Man  ot 
very  good  Courage,  and  well  fpiriced  to  ferve  hi? 
Country,  and  fo  the  lofs  of  him  wis  much  lamen* 
ted.  Hereupon  Moody  unhappily  refign'd  himfelf 
again  into  the  Enemies  hands ;  who  moft  innu- 
manly  tortured  him,  by  faftniftg  him  unto  a 
Stake,  and  roafting  him  alive  j  whofe  Flefli  they 
afterwards  devoured-  Our  Men  confidering  they 
were  fo  far  in  the  Indians  Country,  and  like  to  be 
cncompafs'd,  were  forcd  to  make  a  running 
Fight.  So  fcattering  in  the  Woods,  \q^  JoBn

The  Town  of  Deerfield,  which  had  fufFer'd  fa 
much  Spoil  before  by  Morifieur  4rteli^  was  on 
June  i^d  oblig'd  to  a  new  Encounter,  by  Mon* 
fieur  Ravell  his  Son- in- Law,  who  with  one  hun- 
dred and  eighty  French  and  Indians^  expeAed  td 
lay  all  defoltte  :  But  the  Town  being  alarrn'd, 
they  valiantly  refifted,  with  the  lofs  only  of  one 
Man,  and  another  wounded.  After  that  the  Ene- 
my kill'd  two  at  Brookfieldy  one  at  Wells,  and  took 
another  Captive. 

Col.  Fetch  who  was  noW  in  England^  and  Well 
acquainted  with  the  Continent  of  America^  was 
very  fenfible  that  the  reduAion  of  Canada  was  of 
abfolute  neceffiiy,  for  fubduing  the  Indians  j  up- 
on which  he  laid  a  Plan  of  the  whole  Country 
before  fome  of  the  chief  Minifters  of  State^  re- 
prelenting  every  thing  in  its  true  Light.  General 
Nicholfon  added  all  his  Intereft  to  the  Motion 
made  by  Col.  Vetch,  and  between  them  they  ob- 
tainM  a  promife  for  fufficient  Forces  both  by  Sea 
and  Land,  for  the  Conqueft  of  Canada*  They 
arrived  early  in  the  Spring,  with  her  Majefifs^ 
H  Royal 


(jo) 

Royal  Commsinds  and  Inftrutaions  to  the  Gover-^ 
nours  of  the  feveral  Provwces,  to  furnifli  their  re* 
fpe^ive  Quota's.  To  fuch  as  (hould  offer  volun- 
teers, they  prefented  a  good  Firelock,  Cartouch- 
box.  Flints,  Ammunition,  a  Coat,  Hat  and  Shirt ; 
with  an  affurance  of  her  Majcfi/s  Princely  Fa- 
vour unto  all  fuch  as  fhould  diftinguifh  them- 
feh'es. 

Upon  this  the  feveral  Govermurs  contributed 
their  utmoft  Affiftance^  and  confidering  that 
NewTork  (with  the  adjacent  places)  lay  neareft 
the  Lake^  it  was  refolved  that  Co!-  Nicholfon 
fhouid  command  the  feveral  Troops  fiom  thence, 
for  the  attacking  of  Mount-Rcaly  while  Col.  Vtuh 
Was  preparing  to  liead  the  Forces  by  Sea. 

But  it  often  happens  in  the  courfe  of  Divine 
Providence,  that  when  our  Expe&lt;5lations  are  at 
the  higheft,  things  come  to  nothing.  For  while 
our  Forces  were  ready,  and  after  a  vaftExpence 
by  long  waiting,  there  was  a  Oop  at  home  from 
any  further  proceeding  for  that  time ;  which  oc- 
cofioned  Col.  Nlcbolfon  to  imbarque  again  for 
England^  to  revive  the  Expedition,  if  poffible. 
But  fuch  Was  the  importance  of  Affairs  then  on 
foot,  that  nocwithftanding  his  indefatigable  Care 
and  Pains,  he  could  not  effe&lt;51:  it.  However  he 
obtained  a  fufhcient  Force  for  the  reduction  of 
Tort-Royal  and  Nova  Scotia,  Which  Was  fo  prejudi- 
cial to  our  Filhery  and  Merchandize.

furprizs  of  al3  thinking  Men,  it  was  given  up  un-

in  no  after  Treaties  would  be  perfwaded  to  fur-

the  whole  Army,  which  was  done  by  four  a 
Clock  in  the  Afternoon.  The  Fort  fired  on  them, 
but  did  no  Damage.  In  the  Evening  the  Bomh^ 
Ship  came  up,  and  falured  them  with  feven  Shels, 
which  number  the  Fort  returned,  but  without 
Execution.  On  Thurfday  the  twenty  fixth  at

they  lay  behind  the  Fences,  who  kiH'd  three  of 
our  Men-  Upon  landing  the  Stores,  which 
were  brought  up  in  the  Night,  the  Enemy  dif-

we  mounted  fome  of  our  Guns,  and  made  prepa- 
rations to  bring  up  the  flat  bottom  Boats  with  the 
Artillery  and  Ammunition.  In  the  Evening  our 
Bomb-Ship  came  up  again,  and  threw  thirty  fix 
Shells  into  the  Fort,  which  put  them  into  fuch  an 
amazing  Terror,  as  brought  to  my  Mind  the

only  defiring  a  Capitulatien  with  fome  of  the  frincipal 
officers  on  each/tde^  which  was  granted  ;  and  there- 
upon a  Ceffation  of  Arms.    Next  Day  the  Ar-

by  General  Nicbolfon  and   the  Governour*    Open

two  hundred  Men,  five  Captains^  and  eight  SubaU

Capt.  Davifon  marched   firft   at  the  head  of  fifty 
Granadeers  ^  Major  Ahbercromhy,  Capt.  Mafcareen^ 
Capt.  Bartlett,  Capt.  Adams,  and  Capt.  Lyon,  fol-

Hobby   on  the  left^   with   Monficur   Bona^venture 
and  D'  Gcutcn  who  were  Hoftages ;   and  then  the 
Field-Officers,  with  a  great  many  others  advanced 
to  the  Fort ;  where   the  French  Governour  met 
them  halfway  on  the  Bridge,   with  Col.  Reading 
and  Capt.  Matthews,  who  were  Hoftages  on  our 
fide,  and  complimented  him  in  thefe  Words. 

Sir,  I  am  very  forry  for  the  King  my  Mafler,  tn 
loofing  fo  brave  a  Fort,  and  the  Territories  adjoining  • 
hut  count  my  f elf  happy  in  falling  into  the  Hands  cfone 
fo  Noble  and  Generous,  and  now  deliver  up  the  Keys 
of  the  Fort,  and  all  the  Magazine  into  your  Handsy 
hoping  to  give  you  a  Vifit  next  Spring.  Which  Keys 
the  General  immediately  delivered  to  Col.  Vetcfj, 
as  Governour  of  the  Fort,  by  vertue  of  her  Ma- 
jefty's  Inftrudions :  Whereupon  Monfieur  S^pw-- 
ctf/  with  his  Officers  and  Troops  marched  out 

with 


(50 

with  Drums  beating.  Colours  flying,  and  Guns 
Jlioulclered  ;  each  paying  rheir  Refpeds  to  the 
General  as  they  pafled  by  ;  and  then  our  Army 
entred  the  Fort,  hoillfed  the  Union-Flag,  and  drank 
the  ^€«m's  Health  firing  al!  the  Guns  round  the 
Fort  J  aslikewifedidthe  Men  of  War,  and  other 
Veffels  in  the  River. 

On  the  Succefs  of  thefe  her  Majefty's  Arms,  a 
Day  of  Thanksgiving  was  folemniz'd ;  and  agree- 
able to  the  Articles  of  Capitulation,  three  Veflels 
were  appointed  to  tranfport  the  Soldiers  unto 
France^^  being  two  hundred  and  fifty  eight  ;  who 
befides  the  common  AUowance,  had  a  confidera- 
ble  flock  of  Wine,  Brandy,  Sugar,  Spice,  and  o- 
ther  things,  with  a  plentiful  fupply  for  the  late 
Governour.  After  this  a  Council  of  War  was 
call'd,  who  refolved,  that  Major  Levinfion,  with 
St.  Cafteerty  and  three  Indian  Guides,  fhould  go  to 
the  Governour  of  Canada^  about  the  Exchange  of 
Captives,  and  inform  him  how  Matters  were 
here.  Their  firft  arrival  was  at  Tencbfdot,  at  St. 
Cafleens  Houfe,  who  courteoufly  entertained  him. 
From  thence  they  went  to  the  Ifland  of  Lett^ 
where  they  met  with  fifty  Canoos  and  twice  as 
many  Indians,  befides  Women  and  Children ; 
where  were  two  E9?glijh  Prifoners,  taken  a  little 
before  at  Winter- Harbour.  Two  Days  after  one 
of  the  Prifoners  made  his  efcape  from  an  Ifland 
where  he  was  hunting  with  his  Mafter,  carrying 
with  him  both  his  Canoo  and  Gun,  and  left  him 
behind  ;  which  fo  exafperated  the  Wretch,  that 
when  he  got  from  thence,  and  came  where  Major 
LcvinJIon  wasj  he  took  him  by  «he  Throat  with 

bis 


his  Hatchet  in  Hts  Hand,  ready  to  give  him  the 
fatal  ftroke,  had  not  St.  Cafletn  interpofed  ;  He 
was  however  kept  Prifoner  fome  time  ;  but  hf 
the  prudent  management  and  mediation  of  that 
^Gentleman  was  releafed.  November  the  4th.  they 
took  their  departure,  and  nex*-  dsy  the  Majors  Cj* 
mo  overfare,  drowning  one  hidUn,  where  he  alio 
loft  his  Gun  and  all  he  had  ;  after  that  coming  a* 
mong  the  Ice,  their  Canoo  was  cut  to  pieces, 
which  obliged  them  to  travel  the  reft  of  the  way 
by  Land,  thro*  horrible  Deferts  and  Mountains, 
being  often  forced  to  head  Rivers  and  Lakes,  and 
fome  times  Knee  deep  in  Snow ;  fcarce  paffing  a 
dav  without  fording  fome  River  or  other,  which 
in  fome  places  were  very  rapid  and  dangerous  j  &amp; 
for  nineteen  days  together  never  faw  the  Sun,  the 
Wearher  being  very  ftormy  and  full  of  Fogs,  and 
the  Trees  fo  prodigious  thick,  that  in  many  places 
it  was  with  difficulty  they  go:  thro' :  being  moft- 
ly  Spruce,  and  Cedar,  and  the  way  under  foot  fo 
extream  rocky,  that  it  was  almoft  next  to  an  im- 
poffibility.  At  laft  their  Provifions  were  wholly 
fpent,  fo  that  for  fix  days  together  they  had  not 
one  morfel  to  eat  but  what  they  fcraped  oiF  the 
frozen  Earth,  or  off  the  bark  of  Trees*  After 
thefe  unfpeakable  Difficulties  they  arrived  at^e- 
heck  Dfcember  the  fixteenth,  where^^  they  were 
handfomely  entertained,  and  aft^r  fome  time  of 
Refrefhmenr,  difcours'd  about  the  Prifoners.  The 
Governour  at  their  return,  fent  two  Gentlemen 
with  them  to  Bofldn,  to  treat  on  the  fame  head* 
Six  Days  homeward  his  Man  fell  fick,  whom  he 
left  in  a  Hofpital  at  Troy  River*  From  thence 
they  came  to  SbamhUe^  and  brought  with  thent 
I  three 


three  birch  Canoos,  being  thirteen  in  number ; 
which  Canoos  they  carried  fevemy  Miles  by 
Land,  thro*  the  Woods  and  Ice,  and  then  paffed 
in  them  fixty  Miles  by  Water,  croffing  the  Lake, 
They  did  not  arrive  at  Many  till  February  igd. 
Early  in  the  Spring  the  Enemy  appeared  as 
infuhing  as  ever :  The  firft  that  fell  under  their 
Cruelty  was  Benjamin  Prehhk  of  Tork ;  bat  the 
moft  afFeding  and  furprizing  Stroke  was  on  CoL 
Hilton  of  Exeter^  who  being  deeply  engaged  in 
the  Mafting  Affair,  and  having  feveral  Trees  of 
value  that  were  fellM  fourteen  miles  up  the  Coun- 
try, went  out  with  feventcen  Men  to  peel  off  the 
Bark  for  fear  of  Worms :  But  not  being  fo  care- 
ful and  watchful  as  they  ought  to  be,  on  "July  the 
twenty  fecond  they  were  ambufli'd  by  a  Body  of 
Indians  that  were  making  a  defcent  upon  us* 
They  took  two  and  kiil'd  three,  whereof  the 
Collonel  was  one ,  which  fo  furpriz'd  the  reft, 
(their  Guns  being  wet)  that  they  all  ran  without 
ifiring  one  (liot,  or  making  the  leaft  Reprifal. 
This  caus'd  chc  Enemy  to  triumph,  and  the  more 
becaufe  they  flew  a  fuperiour  Officer,  whom  they 
foon  fcalpt,  and  with  utmoft  revenge  ftruck  their 
Hatchets  in  his  Brains,  leaving  a  Lance  at  his 
Heart.  Next  day  about  a  hundred  Men  went  in 
purfuic  of  them,  but  could  not  difcover  any.  One 
of  the  fl^in  was  buried  on  the  fpot,  the  other  two 
brought  home,  where  rhe  Collonel  was  decent- 
ly interr'd,  the  feveral  Troops  in  great  Solem- 
nity attending  his  Corps-  He  was  a  Gentleman 
of  good  Temper,  Courage  and  ConduA,  refpec- 
ted  and  lamented  by  all  that  knew  him. 

After 


(f9) 

After  this  the  Enemy  appear'd  very  bold  and 
infolent  in  the  Town,  in  open  Streets ;  where 
they  carried  Captive  four  Children  as  they  were 
at  play.  They  then  took  John  Wedgvjoody  whom. 
they  carried  to  Canada,  and  after  that  kill'd  John 
Magoon,  oi  \N\\om  one  thing  is  remarkable  ;  that 
three  Nights  before  he  dreamt  he  fliould  be  (lain 
by  the  Indians,  at  a  certain  place  near  his  Bro- 
ther's Barn ,  which  place  he  frequently  vifued 
with  a  melancholly  Countenance,  telling  feveral 
of  the  Neighbourhood,  that  within  a  little  while 
he  fhould  be  kill'd,  and  pointed  to  the  very  fpot, 
which  fell  out  accordingly. 

After  this  they  bent  their  fury  Wefiward,  where 
at  IVater-hiiry  they  kill'd  three,  and  one  at  Simfbu^ 
ry.  About  the  fame  time  they  fell  on  Brookfield, 
and  I  hen  at  Miirlborough,  where  they  (hot  the  Poft 
as  he  was  riding  to  Hadly&gt;  From  thence  they 
went  to  Chelmsford,  where  they  wounded  Majoj 
7'yng,  who  foon  after  expired  j  he  was  a  true  lov- 
er of  his  Country,  and  had  very  ofcen  diftin- 
guifh'd  himfelf  a  Gentleman  of  good  Valour  and 
Condud. 

Auguji  the  zd.  between  forty  and  fifty  French  &amp; 
Indians  fell  on  Winter-Harbour ^  where  they  kill'd  a 
Woman  and  took  two  Men,  one  whereof  was 
Mr.  Pendleton  Fletcher ,  which  was  the  fourth  time 
of  his  Captivity  ;  but  he  was  foon  redeemed  by 
the  Garrifon,  The  week  after  they  came  with  a 
far  fljperiour  Number,  kill'd  «-hree,  and  carryed  a- 
way  fix,  one  of  the  flain  they  barbaroutly  Skin'd, 
and  made  themfelves  Girdles  of  his  Skin.  The 
laft  that  fell  this  Seafon  was  Jacoh  Garlardof-  Co

As  the  Winter  approached,  Collonel  Walton 
was  again  preparing  to  traverfe  the  Eafiern  Shore 
with  an  hundred  and  feventy  Men,  being  the  ufu- 
ai  Seafon  of  vifiting  their  Clam-banks,  where  one 
of  the  Enemy  very  happily  fell  into  his  Hands  as 
they  were  encamping  on  an  Ifland  ;  for  by  the 
fmoak  that  the  EngUfh  made,   they  came  near, 
concluding  them  to  be  feme  of  their  own  Tribe, 
bat  finding  themfelves  deceived,   they  attempted 
to  efcape,  which  our  Men  prevented.  The  Prin- 
cipal Indian  among  them  was    Arruhawlkwahemt^ 
chiefSachemof  N^r/Vgw^/i^,  an  a&lt;5live  bold  Fel- 
low, and  one  of  an  undaunted  Spirit ;  for   when 
they  ask't  feveral  Queftions   he  made  them  no 
Reply,  and  when  they  threatned  him  with  Death, 
he  iaught  at  it  with  contempt ;  upon  which  they 
delivered  him  up  unto   our  friend  Indians^  who 
foon  became   his  Executioners ;  but   when  the 
St^uaw  faw   the  deftiny  of  her  Husband,  fiie  be- 
came more  flexible,  and  freely  difcovered  where 
each  of  them  encampt-     Upon  this  they  went 
further  l^aft,  and  took  three  more  ;  after  that  a 
certain  Indian  (  thro'  difcontent  )  furrender'd  h'm- 
felf,  and  informed  of  Mauxts  and  feveral   others 
that  were  at  Femhfcot,  which  our  Forces  had  re- 
gard unto  J  and  as  they  returned  went  up  Saeo  Ri- 
ver, where  they  took  two,  and  kill'd   five  more* 
Now  altho'  the  Number  that  we  deftroyed  of 
them  feems  inconfiderable  to  what  they  did  of 
ours,  yet  by  Cold^  Hunger,  and  Sicknefs,  at  leaft 
2  third  of  them  was  wafted  fince  the  Warhegun. 
For  as  their  number  at  firft  (  among  the  feveral 
Tribes  )   were  computed  four   hundred  and  fifty 
iighiing  Men  from  Penchfcot,  H^eftwardj  they  were 

now 


C  &lt;5i  &gt; 

now  reduc'd  to  about  three  hundred,  which  made 
the  Old  Men  weary  of  the  War,  and  to  covet 
Peace.  At  (Winter- Harbour  they  took  Corporal 
^;crj,  but  Toon  released  him,  without  otfering  him 
the  lead  Injury,  and  then  went  unto  the  Fore 
with  a  Flag  of  Truce  profeding  their  defire  of  a 
Pacification.  Yet  in  a  few  Days  afrer  fome  came 
in  an  Hoftile  m^innQv  ^tCocbechoj  where  they  flew 
Thomas  Do'wns  and  three  more  while  ae  Work  in 
the  Field.  After  that,  thev  went  to  Tork^  where 
they  kiO'd  one  and  wounded  another,  who  after- 
wards got  to  the  Garrifon  and  reported,  that  as 
they  were  fifliing  in  the  Pond  they  were  way-laid 
fcy  five  Indians^  one  of  which  ran  furioufiy  at  him, 
and  knockt  him  on  the  head  ;  afrer  this  they 
Scalp'd  him,  and  cut  him  deep  in  the  Neck.  He 
perfectly  retained  his  Senfes,  but  made  not  the 
leaft  motion  or  ftruggle,  and  by  this  means  ftv'd 
his  Life.  Afril  the  twenty  ninth  the  like  num- 
ber appear'd  at  IVeUs,  where  rhey  kill'd  two  Men 
9s  thev  weie  pisinting  of  Corn.  After  that  they 
flew  ^chn  Church  oiCochechn,*  and  then  way-laid 
the  People  as  they  returned  from  publlck  Wor- 
ihip ;  where  they  wounded  one,  and  laid  violent 
Hands  on  another,  but  upon  firing  their  Guns, 
fome  who  were  before,  return'd  and  refcued  the 
Prifoner.  Upon  this  Col-  Walton  wenc  with  two 
Companies  of  Men  to  OJJipe  and  H^inmfiJJiocaf 
Ponds,  being  places  of  general  Refort  for  Fifli' 
ing.  Fowling  and  Hunting  ;  but  faw  none,  only 
a  few  deferted  iVigwar^fs ;  for  being  fo  clofely 
purfued  from  one  place  to  another,  tl&gt;ey  removed 
to  other  Nations,  leaving  only  a  few  Cut- throats 
behind,  which  kept  the  Country  in  a  conftant 
Alarm.  CoL

f  which  from  that  time  bears  the  Name  of  Ama*

defire  of  the  Conqucd  of  Canada-  Wherefore 
upon  his  return  to  England ^  he  fo  effecSlually  re- 
prefented  to  the  ^ueen  and  Mlnlflry^  the  great 
Advanrage  that  would  accrue  unto  the  Crown 
thereby,  that  he  obtained  Orders  for  a  fufficient 
Force  both  by  Sea  and  Land,  with  the  affiftance 
of  the  fevera!  Colonies.  And  for  the  better  ex- 
pediting the  fame,  he  fet  fail  the  latter  end  of

Qovemours  met,  with  a  firm  Rcfolution  of  carrying

American  Her  M.yefiy  out  of  her  Royal  Favoiir 
was  alfo  pleafed  to  fend  fix  Ships  with  all  manner 
of  Warlike  Stores,  and  a  fine  Train  of  Aniilery 
with  forty  Horfes  to  draw  the  fame. 

lt*s  furprizing  to  think  how  vigoroully  this 
Expedition  was  forwarded,  while  at  Bofton^^Xiho* 
a  Town  but  of  Eighty  Years  (landing,  out  of  a 
howling  Wildernefs  ^  yet  icarce  any  Town  in  the 
Kingdom  (  but  where  Stores  are  laid  up  before  ) 
could  have  effe&lt;5led  the  fame  in  fo  fiiort  a  rime. 
For  in  lefs  than  a  Month  the  whole  Army  was 
fiipply'd  with  ten  weeks  ProviHon,  and  al)  other 
NecelTaries  that  were  wanted  ;  Befidcs  two  Regi-

Command  of  Collonel  Vetch  and  Collonel  Wah-

Sail'd,  Collonel  Nlcholfon  fet  out  for  New  York,  &amp; 
from  thence  for  Albany,  having  ordered  Battots 
beforehand  every  thing  elfe  on  the  Inland  Fron- 
tiers, to  be  in  readinefs  for  paffing  the  Lake  with 
utmoft  Application.  The  AffemWy  of  New-York 
raifed  ten  thoufand  Pounds,  bcfidci  their  Propor-

The  firfl  Harbour  they  made  after  they  fail'd 
from  Nantasket^  was  Cape  Gajpey,  from  thence 
rhey  fallM  up  St,  Laurence's  River,  until  they  got 
up  off  the  Virgin- Monnmns  j  the   Weather  then 

proving 


proving  foggy,  and  the  Wind  frefhning^  the  Ad^ 
miral  ask'd  rhe  Vilots  what  was  bed  to  do  ?  who 
advifed  that  as  the  Fleet  was  on  the  North  Shore, 
it  would  be  heft  to  bring  too,  with  their  heads 
unto  the  Southivard  :  but  he  obftinately  refufing, 
aded  the  reverfe,  and  ordered  their  heads  unto 
the  J&lt;Jorth,  which  was  To  aftonifhing  unto  the  Pi- 
lots,  that  one  and  another  foretold  their  Fear  (un- 
to the  Officers  )  and  the  Deftiny  that  would  at- 
tend them  before  the  Morning ;  which  accord- 
ingly fell  out.  For  at  one  of  the  Clock  nine  Ships 
with  ijoo.  Men  were  all  cafl  afhore,  and  moft 
of  the  reft  in  as  eminent  danger ;  but  fo  foon  as 
the  former  ftruck,  they  fired  their  Guns,  which 
gave  Caution  to  the  refl :  Some  of  which  wore, 
and  flood  off;  others  were  fo  encompaffed  by  the 
Breakers  that  they  were  oblig'd  to  bring  too  their 
Anchors,  which  was  their  laft  Refuge  ;  but  before 
the  day  approached,  the  Wind  happily  fhifted  to 
W.  N.  TV.  upon  which  they  cut  their  Cables  and 
came  to  fail-  Soon  after  a  Council  of  War  was 
caird,  but  the  refult  not  known  until  the  Even- 
ing, and  then  the  Plag  bore  away  to  Sfani^  Ri* 
ver^  without  giving  the  ufual  Signal :  On  which 
many  of  the  windward  Ships  were  left  behind  ^ 
but  a  fmall  Man  of  War  was  ordered  to  Cruife 
the  next  day  for  thofe  that  were  left,  and  to  take 
up  fuch  as  might  be  alive  among  the  dead,  who 
were  about  fix  hundred.  After  this  they  made 
towards  the  Fleet,  but  were  eight  days  in  getting 
down  J  during  which  time  the  Wind  was  Eaft^ 
lifardljf^  and  had  our  Fleet  proceeded,  (as  it  were 
to  be  wifh'd  they  had)  might  eafily  have  got  qnto

upon  this  difaffer  the  whole  Country  (  and  in* 
deed  the  Nation  )  was  aiarm'd,  and  many  Cen- 
fures  andjeloufies  arofe;  fome  imputing  it  to 
Cowardizc,  but  moft  to  Treachery,  and  the  fe- 
crec  Influence  of  fome  Malecontents  then  at 
Helm  ;  ocherwife  why  would  a  matter  of  fuch 
vaft  Importance  to  the  Britii}i  Kingdom,  be  hufh't 
up  in  filence,  and  the  Principal  Officers  not  Sum- 
mon'd  to  appear.  If  the  Admiral  was  in  fault 
wherefore  was  he  not  call'd  to  an  Account  ?  Or 
why  did  not  the  General  to  vindicate  himfelf,  lay 
a  Remonftrance  before  the  Council  Board  ?  And 
the  Pilots^  (  who  were  order'd  from  hence  at  fo 
great  a  Charj^e  to  the  Country  to  reprefent  mat- 
ters in  a  true  light)  been  examined  ?  But  inftead 
thereof,  difmift  without  being  ask'd  oneQueftion. 
However  one  thing  is  remarkable,  that  among 
thofe  that  were  fliipwrack'd  and  lo(t  their  lives, 
there  wis  but  one  fingle  Perfon  that  bslongM  to 
'H^'iV' England  among  tihem. 

Collonel  Nicbolfon  at  this  innc^ure  was  induftri- 
ouflv  engaged  in  getting  the  Battoes  ready  for 
palling  the  Lake  with  a  confidcrable  Number  of 
Friend  Indians,  as  well  as  Englifh,  for  the  attack- 
ing of  Mount  Realy  which  next  to  Rebeck  was  the 
place  of  greateft  Importance  in  all  the  French 
Territories.  But  juft  as  he  was  ready  to  cmbarque 
an  Exprefs  came  and  gave  an  Account  of  ths 
miferable  Difafter  that  befel  the  Fleet :  Whereas, 
if  he  had  proceeded,  his  whole  Army  would  pro- 
bably have  been  cut  off;  For  upon  advice  of  our 
Fleets  misfortune,  the  French  drew  off  all  their 
Auxiliaries  and  moft  of  cheir  Militia  co  reinforce 
Mount  Real,  being  advised  of  the  defcent  that  was 

ma-

making  on  them.  So  great  was  our  lofs  in  this  En- 
terprize  that  it  AfFeded  the  whole  Country  fe- 
ven  Years  after ;  as  the  Advance  &amp;  Expence  of  fo 
much  Money  and  ProviHons  might  well  do-  And 
it  as  much  flufht  the  Enemy  5*  for  out  of  the  ruins 
of  ourVeflels  they  not  only  got  much  Plunder, 
but  fortified  their  CaiUe  and  out  B^irteries  witha 
confiderable  Number  of  Cannon.  They  moreo- 
ver flirr'd  up  the  French  and  Indians  about  Anvapo* 
lu  Royal  to  revolt  from  their  Allegiance  to  che 
Crown.  Capt  Pigeofj  being  ordered  up  the  Rivec 
for  Timber  to  repair  the  Forr,  was  violently  at- 
tackt  by  no  lefs  than  one  hundred  and  fifty,  who 
kill'd  the  whole  Boars  Crow,  wounded  the  Fort 
AlajoTy  and  afterwards  very  barbaroufly  Murdered 
him  :  They  alfo  flew  Capt.  Forh:s  the  Engineer, 
befides  feveral  others,  and  took  thirty  four  of  thqra 
Prifoners.  Soon  afcer  this,  we  were  informed 
of  the  Arrival  of  onr  Britifh  Forces  in  England, 
on  the  9th.  of  05iober  at  Portfwouthy  where  on  the 
15'ch  following,  the  Admirals  Ship  the  Edgar  was 
accidentally  blown  up,  with  400  Seamen  and  fe- 
veral other  People  on  board,  all  the  Officers  being 
on  fhore. 

The  reduiSion  of  Canada  was  a  matter  of  great 
Confequence,  not  only  to  the  Incereft  of  Nei//- 
Er.gland  and  the  adjacent  Colonies ;  but  alfo  to 
the  whole  Briti^i  Empire.  Not  that  in  it  felf  it 
is  of  fuch  intrinfick  Value  ;  for  that  the  Cold  is 
fo  great,  and  the  Ice  fo  rigid,  as  to  imbargo  ic 
more  than  half  the  Year :  But  as  the  ingenious 
Mr.  Dnmmer  obferves  in  a  Letter  of  his  to  a  Na- 
hle  Lord  in  the  Year  171 2,  the  Confequenco 
would  be  very  valuable ;  for  as  it  extends  above

one  thoufand  Leagues  towiirds  the  MtJJififpt^  it 
would  require  a  vaft  confumption  yearly  of  the 
Etfglifi  Manufa(5tury  to  fupport  it ;  there  being 
fo  great  a  number  of  feveral  Nations  that  live 
behind,  which  bring  down  vaft  quantities  of  Furs 
of  all  forts,  as  amount  to  an  incredible  Sum.  But 
her  Majefty's  Royni  Aim,  as  he  notes,  was  not 
fo  immediately  to  advance  a  Trade,  as  the  Secu- 
rity and  Peace  of  her  good  Subjeds  in  North 
America ;  being  thorowly  apprized  that  fo  long 
as  the  French  inhabit  there,  fo  long  the  Ertglifi 
would  be  in  hazard. 

The  Hudfons  Bay  Company,  as  well  as  New- 
foundland^ have  given  a  melancholly  Account  of 
the  many  Ravages  that  have  been  committed 
there  by  the  powerful  Affiftance  of  thofe  Salva'- 
g6i'    I'rn  not  infenfible  that  many  have  blamed 
NcW'Englandy  and  caft  the  Odium   wholly  on 
them    for  not  fucceeding  in    this  Enterprize ; 
but   why  New-England  fliould  be  branded  with 
fuch  Infamy,  I  never  could  yet  hear  the  Grounds, 
or  any  Reafon  affigned,  but  what  fprung  from 
fome  capricious  Brains,  who  were  no  well  wifh- 
ers  either  to  the  Caufe  or  Country,  and  would 
ftigmatize  us  if  poffibe,  as  Enemies  to  the  Church, 
and  Difloyal  to  our   Sovereign,    But  why  Ene- 
mies to  the  Church  ?»  or  wherein  is  ic  that  we  dif- 
fer from  them  ?  fave  only  in  the  Ceremoniesy  which 
nonQ  of  them   will  allow  to  be  Eflfential.     We 
indeed  are  called  Dijfenters ;    but  many  of  thofe 
that  are  of  the  Church,  dillent  more  from  one  a- 
jiocher  than  we  do :  For  what  we  diffcnt  from, 
is,  (as  they  themfelves  term  it^  only  in  matters 
©f  Indifferency  5  but  many  of  them  arc  Diffen-

DoBrine  the  fame  ?  the  Sahbatb  as  ftridtly  folem- 
nized  ?  and  our  Mode  of  Worfbip  as  agreeable 
to  the  primitive  Conftitution,  as  any  other  Church 
in  the  World  ?  Not  but  that  we  have  degenera- 
ted from  the  pious  Steps  of  our  Forefathers; 
yet  1  am  bold  to  fay,  that  as  to  number,  there 
are  as  many  fincere  and  good  People  in  New^ 
England,  as  in  any  one  pare  of  the  World.  But  I 
beg  pardon  for  this  Digreffion,  which  is  only  to 
wipe  off  the  Calumny  that  is  too  often  caft  upon 
us.  Now  as  to  our  Loyalty^  fuch  pregnant  In* 
ftances  may  be  given  thereof,  as  will  be  furpri-

Year  1690.  in  our  defcent  on  Canada,  where  we 
loft  many  hundred  brave  Men,  and  at  our  own 
Coft  expended  upwards  of  one  hundred  and  forty 
thoufand  Founds  in  Money,  without  any  Allow-

mifcarried  in  that  alfo,  yet  as  Mr  Dummer  ob-

Body  of  Troops  under  the  Command  of  Collonel 
Nicholfon,  And  all  this  under  the  oppreffi- 
on  of  twenty  Years  War  before  by  the  French 
and  Indians,  Yet  in  the  laft  fatal  Expedition,  we 
fupplyed  more  than  our  ^ota  which  the  ^een

In  the  Hiftory  of  Sr-^  Sehaftian  Cohhety  which  I 
before  hinted,  we  were  informed  that  he  took  the 
great  River  of  St.  Laurence  for  the  Crown  oiGreat 
Britain  in  the  Reign  of  King  Henry  the  feventh, 
which  according  to  the  French  Hiftorians,  con- 
tains almoft  2000  Miles  in  length  and  840  in 
breadth,  Scituace  between  the  59th  and  64th  De*- 
grees  of  North  Latitude,  which  takes  in  Acadia^ 
Newfoundland  and  Terra  De  Labor ador.  This  great 
Territory  in  the  beginning  of  the  laft  Century, 
by  the  Contrivance  of  fome  then  at  Helm,  was 
taken  pofleflion  off  by  the  French^  who  fince  that 
have  made  many  line  Settlements,  more  efpecial- 
ly  at  Mount  Real  and  ^eeheck.  The  latter  is 
called  a  City  commanded  by  a  Caftle,  which 
ftands  on  an  Eminence,  in  which  are  five 
Churches,  a  Cathedral,  a  B'fhop  and  12  Prehear 
daries-  Our  unhappy  Difappointment  againfl: 
Canada  gave  great  uneafinefs  to  the  Country,  and 
was  matter  of  fear  leaft  new  Reprifals  would  be 
made  on  the  out  skirts ;  wherefore  it  was  deter- 
mined that  Collonel  IValton  with  one  hundred 
and  eighty  Men  Ihould  go  to  Penobfcot  and  the 
adjacent  Territories,  where  he  burnt  two  Fifliing 
Veflels  ( that  were  preparing  to  come  upon  us 
early  in  the  Spring  )  and  took  fev^ral  Captives, 
with  fome  Plunder. 

But  Ne-uj- England  ^x.  this  time  was  not  alone 
infulted.  The  Jefuits  were  every  way  endea- 
vouring to  ftir  up  the  Indiansy  and  at  laft  did  in- 
fluence them  to  make  a  defcent  on  the  Borders 
of  Virginia^  where  they  murdered  a  great  many 
of  the  Palatines :  Upon  Which  a  confiderable 
Number  was  raifed.  who  went  in  queft  of  them.

and  deftroyed  four  To-wns^  befides  a  great  many 
whom  they  took  Prifonei^s.  Some  of  them  were 
fuppofed  to  be  the  Senakees,  who  are  a  Branch  of 
the  Five  Nations,  Another  Tribe  called  the 
Shacktausy  made  many  Incurfions  on  Carolina  ; 
upon  which  Col.  Gibs  the  Governour  commiffi- 

onated  Capt.  Hafiings  and    B the  Indian 

Emperour,  who  was  in  League  with  the  EngUfh  j 
as  alfo  Capr.  IVelcby  with  the  Affiftancfe  of  the 
Chickflm  Indians,  to  fall  on  them  in  feveral  parts, 
and  in  a  little  time  got  to  their  Head- quarters, 
where  the  Enemy  in  three  Divifions  endeavoured 
to  furround  them,  but  after  a  fmart  Engagement, 
received  a  perfed  Overthrow;  which  was  follow- 
ed with  the  burning  and  deftroying  four  hundred 
Houfes  or  Wigwams.  The  Friend  Indians  ap- 
peared bold  and  acftive,  but  for  want  of  Difci- 
pline  and  a  good  Regulation,  did  not  the  Service 
that  otherwife  they  might-  After  this  Col. 
Barnwell  went  in  purfuit  of  another  Nation  cali'd 
the  Tuskarcrahs,  and  entirely  routed  them. 

I  now  return  to  our  Fronties,  where  at  Exeter ^ 
April  i6th.  1712.  they  kill'd  YAv.Cumngham  as  he 
was  travelling  the  Road  from  Mr.  Hilton  %  to  £%- 
tttr  :  After  that  they  fbot  Samuel  fVebher,  between 
Tork  and  Cape  Neddick  :  Others  fell  on  feveral 
Teams  in  Wells,  where  they  flew  three  &amp;  wound- 
ed as  many  more.  One  of  the  flain  was  Lieut. 
Littkficldy  who  a  Hrtle  before  was  redeemed  out 
of  Captivicy,  and  a  Perfon  very  much  lamented. 
Soon  after  they  appeared  in  the  middle  of  the 
Town,  and  carried  away  two  from  thence.  They 
went  to  Sfruce  Creek^  where  they  kill'd  a  Boy  and 
took  another,  and  then  went  to  Tork,  but  being 

put- 


puifued  ma3e  their  efcape.  Another  Party  fell  on 
the  upper  branch  of  Oyfter- River ,  where  they 
fhot  Jeremiah  Cromett^  and  three  Miles  higher 
burnt  a  Saw-mil!  with  a  great  many  thoufand  of 
Boards.  Next  day  they  flew  Enfign  Tuttle  at  ToU- 
End,  and  wounded  a  Son  of  Lieut-  Herd's  as  he 
flood  Sentinel.  May  14th  about  thirty  French 
and  Indians  who  had  a  defign  on  Tork^  furpriz  d  a 
Scout  of  ours  as  they  were  marching  to  Cape- Ned* 
dick^  where  they  flew  Sergant  Nalton,  and  took  fe- 
ven  befides :  the  remainder  fought  on  a  retreat  till 
they  got  to  a  Rock,  which  for  fome  time  prov'd  a 
good  Barrier  to  them,  and  there  continued  untill 
they  were  releived,  by  the  Vigilant  Care  of  Capt, 
WiUard,  About  this  time  fifty  of  our  Engll^j  who 
went  up  Merrimack' River  returned,  with  the 
good  Account  of  eight  Indians  that  they  had  flain, 
and  of  confiderable  Plunder  befides  which  they 
had  taken,  without  thelofsofone  Man. 

June  I  ft  they  again  came  to  Spruce  Creek^ 
where  they  fliot  John  Tickernell  as  he  was  locking 
his  door,  and  going  to  the  Garrifon  ;  they  alfo 
•wounded  his  Wife  and  knockt  a  Child  on  the 
head,  which  they  Scalpt,  yet  afterwards  it  reco- 
vered. Two  days  after  they  were  feen  at  Amf^ 
hury,  then  at  Kingfiowny  where  they  wounded 
Ebenezjer  Stevhens^  and  Stephen  Gilman^  the  latter 
of  which  they  took  alive  and  inhumanely  Mur- 
dered. After  this  they  kill'd  one  at  Newchawa^ 
wicy^,  and  on  July  1 8th.  fell  on  a  Company  at 
Wells,  where  they  flew  another  and  took  a  Negro 
Captive,  who  afterwards  made  his  Efcape*  The

on  which  a  Scout  was  fentin  perfuif,  but  made 
no  difcovery.  Yet  in  the  inrermictin^  time  they 
took  two  Children  from  Lieut.  Herd's  Garrifon, 
and  not  having  time  to  Scalp  them,  cut  off  both 
their  Heads,  and  carried  them  away-  There  was 
not  a  Man  at  that  time  at  home  ;  however  one 
Eafier  Jones  fupplied  the  place  of  feverai ;  for  ine 
couragioufly  advanced  the  Watch-box,  crying 
aloud,  Here  they  are,  come  on,  come  on ;  which  fo 
terrified  them  as  to  make  them  draw  off,  with- 
out doing  any  further  Mifchief.  The  Enemy  at 
this  time  were  thought  to  be  veiy  numerous,  for 
they  appeared  in  many  Parties,  which  occafion- 
ed  an  additional  number  to  be  left  to  cover  the 
Frontiers,  under  the  Command  of  Capt.  Davu^ 
whofe  vigilant  Care  (thro' the  bleffingof  God  on 
it)  kept  them  from  doing  any  fuFther  Mifchief? 
September  ift  they  kill'd  John  Spencer ,  and  wound- 
ed Dependance  Stover,  Ac  this  time  a  Sloop  from 
Tlacentiay  with  forty  five  French  and  Indians  was 
cruifing  on  our  Coaft,  which  Capt.  Carver  obfer- 
ving,  gave  her  chafe,  and  took  her :  But  our 
Fifliery  at  Cape  Sables,  thro'  the  dtkd  of  the 
Guard-Ship,  were  great  Sufferers  3  where  no  lefs 
than  twenty  fell  into  their  Hands. 

The  laft  Action  that  happened  (of  any  moment) 
this  War,  was  at  Mr.  Plaified's  Marriage  with 
Capt.  Wheel-wrigbth  Daughter  of  IVeUs,  where 
happened  a  great  concourfe  of  People,  who  as 
they  were  preparing  to  mount  in  order  to  theic 
return,  found  two  of  their  Horfes  miffing  ^  upon 
which  Mr.  Downing  with  Ifa^c  Cole  and  others 
went  out  to  feek  them  ;  but  before  they  had  gone 
many  Rods,  the  two  former  were  kill'd  and  the 
L  others 


(  74) 

Others  taken.  The  Noife  of  the  Guns  foon  a- 
Jarm'd  the  Guefts,  and  Capr.-  Lane^  Capt.  Rohm^ 
[on  and  Capr,  Herd,  with  feveral  others  mounted 
their  Horfes,  ordering  twelve  Soldiers  in  the 
mean  time  to  run  over  the  Field,  being  the  near- 
er way  :  But  before  the  Horfemen  got  far,  they 
were  ambufh'd  by  another  Party,  who  killM  Capt. 
Rohinfotiy  and  difmounted  the  reft;  and  yet  they 
al!  efcaped  excepting  the  Brldggroomy  who  in  a 
few  days  after  was  redeemed  by  the  prudent  Care 
of  his  Father,  at  the  Expence  of  more  than  three 
hundred  Pounds.  Capt.  Lane,  and  Capt.  Harmon 
m'jftered  what  Strength  they  could,  and  held  a 
difputs  with  rhem  fome  time,  but  there  was  lit- 
tle or  no  Execution  done  on  cither  fide. 

Not  long  after  this  we  had  advice  of  a  Sufpenfi^ 
on  of  Arms  between  the  tv^o  Crowns^  which  the  7«- 
dians  being  apprized  of,  came  in  with  a  Flag  of 
Truce  and  defired  a  Treaty,  Their  firft  Applica- 
tion was  to  Capt.  Moodey  at  Cafco,  defiring  that 
the  Conferance  might  be  there  ;  but  the  Cover'*

For  a  further  Ratification  of  this  Treaty,  feve- 
ral  Gentlemen  of  both  Governments  virent  from 
Fcrtfmouth  to  Cafco,  where  a  great  Body  of  Indians 
were  affemblec],  to  know  the  Refult  of  matters  ? 
It  being  a  Cuftom  among  them  on  all  fuch  Oc 
cafions,  to  have  che  whok  of  their  Tribes  pre- 


C8i  ) 

fenf;  having  no,  other  Record  of  conveying  to 
Pofterity,  but  what  they  communicate  from  Fa- 
tlier  to  Son,  and  fo  to  the  Son's  Son.     When  the 
feveral  Articles  were  read  and  explained,  by  In- 
terpreters upon  Oath,  (the  Delegates  being  pre- 
fent)   they   fignified  an  unanimous  Confent  and 
Satisfacflion,  by  loud  Huzza's  and  Acclamations 
of  Joy:  Many  Prefents  were  then  made   them, 
which  were  thankfully  received,  and  every  Tribe 
had  their  proportion  given  out ;  but  they  were 
fo  diforderly,  th^t  Mauxt^  faltho'  he  was  the  chief 
Sagamore  in  ail  the  Eafiem  parrs)  was  rob'd  by  the 
Morning  of  all  he  had;  upon  which  he  made  a 
miferable  Complaint  unto  the  Englijh  next  Day&gt; 
of  the  unrulinefs   of   his   young  Men,  who  had 
ftollen  away  all  he   had,  therefore  beg'd  a  new 
Supply.     But  altho'  their  Government  is  fo  A-* 
narchicaly  and  their  Chiefs  have  fo  little  Refpe^t 
and  Honour   fhewn    them,  yet  in  their  Council 
they  obferve  a  very  excellent  Decorum  ;  not  fuf- 
fering  any  to  fpeak  but  one  at  a  time  ;  which  is 
deliver'd    with  fuch  a    remarkable   Pathos,  and 
furprizing  Gravity,  that  there  is  neither  Smile 
nor  Whifper  to  be  obferved,  until  he  that  fpeaks 
has  finifti'd   his  Difcourfe,  who  then  fits  down, 
and  after  that  another  rifeth  up. 

The  Peace  thus  concluded  and  fo  firmly  ratifi- 
ed, gave  matter  of  Encouragmenc  to  the  Eaftern 
Inhabitants  for  re- fettling  their  former  Habitati- 
ons ;  who  were  alfo  countenanced  and  affifted 
by  the  Government,  even  from  Cape-Porpas  to  Ke^ 
ntbeck  River,  where  feveral  Gentlemen  who  had 
large  crads  of  Land,  granted  a  hundred  Acres  to 
M  every 


(8x) 

every  one  for  Encouragment  that  would  go  and 
Settle  ;  fupporcing^  a  Minifter  befides  (  for  fome 
time  )  and  employ  M  a  Sloop  at  their  own  Charge 
for  carrying  and  re-carrying  the  Inhabitants, 
with  their  Stock  ;  which  gave  fo  great  Encou- 
ragment, that  feveral  Towns  began  to  be  fettled, 
as  Bromsivlckj  Topfhamy  Augufia,  George  Teivn,  &amp;c. 
In  which  a  great  many  fine  Buildings  were  ered- 
td,  with  feveral  Saw- wills,  &amp;c. 

A  Fijhery  was  alfo  undertaken  by  the  ingeni- 
ous Do&amp;tr  Noyes,  where  twenty  Veffels  were  em- 
ployed at  a  time.  He  afterwares  built  a  ftone 
Garrifon  d^tAugufia  at  his  own  Charge,  which  was 
judged  to  be  the  bed  in  the  Eafiern  Country  ; 
and  for  a  while  was  kept  at  the  publick  Coft, 
but  afterwards  flighted  ;  which  occafioned  the 
Inhabitants  to  wich  draw,  and  then  the  Indians 
burnt  it  with  feveral  other  Houfes ; 

In  Kcmbeck  River  the  Sturgeon  Fifljery  was  alfo 
begun  and  carried  on  with  fo  great  Succefs,  that 
many  thoufand  Caggs  were  made  in  a  Seafon ; 
and  efteemed  as  good  as  any  that  ever  came  from 
Harnhrougb  or  Norway  ;  Befides  vaft  quantities  of 
Pipe  Staves,  Hogshead  and  Barrel,  Pine  Boards, 
Plank,  and  Timber  of  all  forts,  which  were  not 
only  tranfported  to  Bofion,  but  to  foreign  places ; 
Husbandry  alfo  began  to  thrive,  and  great  ftocks 
of  Cattel  were  raised. 

The  Frejfch  MijJionarUs  perceiving  the  Growth 
of  thefe  Plantations,  foon  animated  the  Indians  to 
difreft  them,  by  inftnuating  that  the  Land  was 
theirs,  and  that  the  EngUfli  invaded  their  Proper- 
ties ;  which  was  a  vile  and  wrong  Suggeftion,  for 
ihat  their  Conveyance  were  from  the  Ancient 

Saga- 


C83) 

Sagamores,  at  leaft  feventy  Years  before  ;  and  the 
Proprietors  did  not  fettle  fo  high  up  by  feveral 
Miles  as  was  formerly  poffeft  be  their  Predecef- 
fours. 

However  the  Indians  could  not  be  fatisfied,  but 
fo  threatned  the  Inhabitants,  that  many  with- 
drew, and  others  were  difcouraged  from  going  to 
Settle.  Soon  after  they  kill'd  many  of  their  Cat- 
tel,  and  commited  many  other  Outrages. 

Nofooner  was  this  Advice  brought  unto  his 
Excellency,  Samuel  Sbute  Efq.  who  was  now  Cap- 
tain General  and  Governour  in  Chief,  in  and 
over  the  Provinces  of  the  Majfachufets-  Bay,  and 
New- Hampfhire,  8zc.  (^nd  onQ  zealoufly  affected 
for  the  Intereft  of  the  Country)  but  he  appointed 
a  Congrefs  at  Arowfick  in  Keneheck  River,  in  Aw 
guft  17 17.  where  a  great  number  of  Indians,  with 
the  Chiefs  of  every  Tribe  accordingly  met.  And 
fome  of  the  Principal  Gentlemen  of  both  Provin- 
ces accompanied  his  Excellency  to  the  place  ap- 
pointed. The  Complaints  on  each  fide  being  impar- 
tially heard  and  debated,  the  Original  Deeds  from 
the  Ancient  Sagamores  were  produced  and  ex- 
plained ;  having  interpreters  on  Oath.  The  Ar- 
ticles drawn  up  and  figned  in  the  year  1715-  were 
again  read  and  ratified,  to  the  feeming  Satisfadi- 
on  of  the  Principal  Sachems,  who  inclined  to 
Peace  ;  and  imputed  the  late  Mifcarriages  unto 
the  young  Men,  but  were  now  refolved  on  a'^irm 
Harmony,  and  would  in  no  refpe(5l  violate  the 
former  Treaties.  Upon  this  his  Excelltncy  made 
them  fcveral  Prefents,  which  they  thankfully  re- 
ceived, and  in  acknowledgment  thereof,  returned 
him  a  Belt  of  Wamjam,  with  fome  Beavour  Skins:

(84) 
After  this  they  drink  the  Kings  Health,  and  pro- 
mised Allegience  to  the  Crown  o^ Great  Britain  ;  fo 
that  every  thing  had  now  the  promifing  Afped 
of  a  lafting  Peace.  One  thing  I  cannot  here  o- 
mit ;  three  days  after  our  departure,  a  number  of 
Indians  went  a  Dupk  hunting,  which  was  a  fea- 
fon  of  the  year  that  the  old  ones  generally  (hed 
their  Feathers  in,  and  the  young  are  not  fo  well 
fluftit  as  to  be  able  to  fly  ;  they  drove  them  like 
a  flock  of  Sheep  before  them  into  the  Creeks, 
where  without  either  Powder  or  Shot  they  kill'd 
at  one  time  four  thoufand  and  fix  hundred  ;  for 
they  followed  them  fo  clofe  that  they  knockt 
thevn  down  with  Billets  and  Paddles,  and  fold  a 
great  number  of  them  to  the  EngUJh  for  a  Penny 
a  dozen,  which  is  their  practice  yearly,  tho'  they 
feldom  make  fo  great  a  Slaughter  at  once*  But 
before  two  years  were  expired,  they  again  began 
to  infult  the  Inhabitants,  being  fpur'd  on  by  the 
JefmtSy  which  occafioned  a  Scout  of  fifty  or  fixty 
Men  to  be  fent  out,  who  kept  them  in  fome  awe. 
But  in  the  year  1720.  they  began  to  be  more  in- 
folent,  and  appeared  in  greater  Bodies ;  upon 
which  Collonel  Walton  was  ordered  with  about 
two  hundred  Men  to  guard  the  Frontiers,  and 
was  after  that  appointed  with  Capt.  Moody^  Har* 
man  'Fenhallow,  and  Wainrigbt  to  fend  to  their 
Chiefs  for.  Satisfadion  for  the  late  Hoftilitys 
which  they  had  done  in  killing  the  Cattle,  &amp;c. 
The  Indians itvix'm^  the  Q,vtnt  promised  to  pay  two 
hundred  Skins,  and  for  their  fidelity  to  deliver 
up  four  of  their  young  Men  as  Hoftages.  After 
this  they  became  tolerably  quiet,  but  in  the 
Spring  grew  as  infolent  a$  before  ^  efpecially  in

Conference ;  efpecially  with  Mounfieur  Dela^ 
chafe,  and  Sabafiian  Ralle  who  were  Jefuits  ; 
Mounfieur  Croizen  from  Canada,  and  St  Cafteen 
from  Venohfcot  came  alfo  along  with  them,  who 
brought  a  Letter  for  Governour  Shute  in  behalf  of 
the  feveral  Tribes,  importing,  That  if  the  Englifh 
did  not  remove  and  quit  their  Land  in  three 
weeks,  they  would  burn  their  Hoafes  and  kill 
them  as  alfo  their  Cattle.  Upon  this  an  additio- 
nal Number  of  Soldiers  were  fent  under  the  com- 
mand of  Collonel  Tbaxter  and  Lieur.  Col.  Goff^, 
and  feveral  Gentlemen  of  the  Council  were  alfo 
appointed  to  enquire  into  the  ground  of  thefe 
Tumults,  and  if  poffible  to  renew  the  Pacificati- 
on ;  who  accordingly  went  and  fent  Scouts  to  call 
the  Indians  in,  but  they  flighted  the  Meffage  with 
derifion.  Hereupon  the  Soldiers  were  order'd  to 
continue,  and  reinforce  the  Garrifons  that  Winter, 
But  in  the  Summer  they  renewed  their  infults, 
and  on  the  thirteenth  of  June  1722  about  fixty 
of  them  in  twenty  Canoos,  came  and  took  nine 
Families  in  Merry  meeung-Bay,  moft  of  which  they 
afterwards  fet  at  liberty,  but  fent  Mr,  Hamilton, 
Love,  Handjon^  Trefcot  and  Edgar  to  Canada  ;  who 
with  great  difficulty  and  expence  afterwards  got 
clear.  They  then  made  a  defcent  on  St,  Georges, 
where  they  burnt  a  Sloop,  took  feveral  Prifoners, 
and  fought  the  Garrifon  fome   time  •   and  in  a 

Month 


(80 

Month  after  came  a  greater  Body  from  P^- 
nohfcot,  who  kiird  five  and  engag'd  the  Fort 
twelve  Days ;  being  very  much  encouraged  by 
the  influence  of  the  Fryar  that  was  with  them. 
But  finding  they  could  make  no  great  impreffion, 
endeavoured  to  undermine  it.  and  had  made  a 
confiderable  progrefs  therein,  till  upon  the  falling 
of  much  Rain,  the  Trenches  caved  in,  which 
caufed  the  feige  to  break  up,  with  the  lofs  of 
twenty  of  them  in  the  Engagment,  as  we  were 
afterwards  informed.  About  the  fame  time  Capt. 
Samuel  with  five  Others  boarded  Lieut.  Tilton,  as 
he  lay  at  Anchor  a  fifhing  near  Damark  Govs  : 
They  pinion'd  him^  and  his  Brother,  and  beat 
them  very  forely  :  But  at  laft  one  got  clear  and 
releafed  the  other;  who  then  fell  with  great  Fu- 
ry upon  the  Indians ,  threw  one  over- board,  and 
mortally  wounded  two  more- 

Capt.  Sawge,  Capt,  Blin,  and  Mr.  Vewton^  who 
at  this  time  were  coming  from  Annapolis,  and 
knew  nothing  of  their  Ravages,  went  into  ^aJJ'a^ 
nsaquady  for  Water.  They  were  no  fooner  afhore, 
but  found  themfelves  hem'd  in  by  a  Body  of  7«- 
Jians,  the  French  bafeiy  (landing  by  and  fufFering 
it.  They  wanted  to  divide  the  Cargo  of  the  Sloop 
among  them,  and  at  laft  f^nt  Capt.  Savage  on 
board  to  procure  fome  Ranfome.  But  the  Wind 
rifing,  he  was  forc'd  off,  and  made  the  beft  of 
his  way  to  Bofton :  Thofe  that  he  left  (after 
fome  Difficulty  and  Expence)  were  releafed. 

Capt.  Harmon  who  was  now  in  Ktnehecky  went 
up  the  River  with  a  Detachment  of  thirty  four 
Men,  and  feeing  fome  Fires,  went  afhore  in  the 
Night,  where  he  came  on  eleven  Canooo5 :  The 

Indiam 


(87) 
In^favs  were  lying  round  the  Fire,  and  fo  weari- 
ed, by  much  Dancing  the  day  before  upon  the 
Succefs  they  had,  that  they  tumbled  over  them 
as  they  lay  afleep.  Reports  were  various  as  to 
the  number  of  Indiam  that  were  then  flain  ;  fome 
fay  eighteen,  others  not  fo  many :  However 
they  brought  away  fifteen  Guns  5  and  at  a  little 
diftance  found  the  Hand  of  an  Engli(Jiman  laid  on 
the  ftump  of  a  Tree,  and  his  Body  mangled  after 
a  barbarous  manner ;  having  his  Tongue,  Nofe 
and  private  parts  cut  off:  They  brought  away 
the  Body,  and  gave  it  a  decent  Burial.  It  was 
found  to  be  the  Body  of  Adofes  Eaton  of  Salisbury. 
In  this  brave  attempt  of  Capt,  Harmon^  which 
was  effeded  in  ten  minutes,  we  loft  not  one 
Man,  yet  at  the  fame  time  a  great  Body  oi  Indi- 
ans lay  near,  who  beirjg  ftartled  at  the  Noife 
that  was  made,  arofe  and  fired  feveral  Guns,  but 
did  no  Damage. 

The  Country  at  this  time  was  in  a  furprizing 
Ferment,  and  generally  difpofed  to  a  War  ;  buc 
the  Governour  and  Council  could  not  readily  come 
into  it,  confidering  the  vaft  Expence  andEfFa- 
fion  of  Blood  that  would  unavoidably  follow  : 
Befides  fome  were  not  fatisfied  with  the  Lawful- 
nefs  of  it  at  this  time  :  For  alcho'  they  believed 
the  Indians  to  be  very  criminal  in  many  refpeds, 
yet  were  of  Opinion  that  the  Englljh  had  not  fo 
pundually  obferved  the  Promifes  made  to  them 
of  Trading-houfes  for  the  benefit  of  Commerce 
and  Traffick,  and  for  the  preventing  of  Frauds 
and  Extortions,  too  common  in  the  private  deal- 
ings of  the  EngUfl)  with  them-  But  the  grand 
abyfc  to  them  is  the  felling  of  ftrong  Drink  to 

them, 


(88) 

rhem,  which  has  occafioned  much  quarreling  and 
Sin  and  the  lofs  of  many  Lives,  to  the  great  Scan- 
dal of  Religion,  and  reproach  of  the  Country. 
His  Excellency  was  fenfible  of  the  Promifes  that 
he  made  them  at  the  Treaty  of  Pacification  ; 
which  he  failed  not  to  lay  before  the  General 
Aflembly  ;  but  he  met  with  fo  much  oppoficion 
chat  nothing  could  be  efFe&lt;5led.  The  firing  an 
Armourer  at  the  Publick  Charge,  was  alfo  engag- 
ed, but  nothing  done  therein ;  So  that  the  Indians 
were  full  of  refentmems,  and  thought  themfelves 
wrong'd.  Yet  ail  this  time  they  made  no  appli- 
cation unto  the  Government  for  redrefs,  which 
they  ought  to  have  done  by  the  Articles  of  A- 
greement,  but  broke  forth  into  Horrid  and  cruel 
Outrages,  by  burning  kilJing  and  deftroying.  At 
laft  the  Gouernour  by  repeated  Addreifes  from  the 
People,  was  obliged  to  call  the  Council  together 
to  concert  what  was  proper  to  be  done,  who  ad- 
vifed,  to  the  proclaiming  an  open  War,  But 
their  not  cofulting  before- hand  with  the  other 
Governments  was  certainly  a  great  overfight ;  who 
probably  would  have  come  into  it,  and  thereby 
have  help'd  to  fupporc  the  Charge,  which  novi/ 
lay  wholly  on  the  Maffachufms  and  N&amp;wbamf-

GOD  Save  the  King. 

The  abovcfaid  Declaration  ( for  fubftance  ) 
wasalfo  given  out  the  Week  after,  at  the  Coun- 
cil-Chamber at  Portftnoiithy  in  the  Province  of 
Ne'ivhampjljire, 

Now  altho*  the  Settlements  in  Keneheck  were 
the  firft  that  were  molefted,  yet  it's  not  to  be 
fuppofed  chat  the  bent  of  the  Enemies  Fury  was 
on  them  alone,  as  fomc  would  infinuate ;  for 
at  the  fame  time  they  interrupted  the  Fifhery 
throughout  all  Nova-Scotia  ;  many  have  refleded 
on  the  Government  for  fuffering  a  Fort  to  be  at 
St.  Georges^  as  if  that  did  irritate  the  Indians ;  but 
why  the  Proprietors  might  not  make  an  improv- 
nient  thereof,  as  weil  as  any  others  on  their  right 
of  Purchafe  1  know  not ;  confidering  thar  it  was 
granted  from  the  Crown,  and  no  exemption  made 
at  the  Treaty  of  Peace.  Yet  at  the  lame  time  I 
muft  be  free  to  fay,  that  there  was  too  great  in- 
dulgence at  firft  in  the  Government  in  lufFering

fo  many  Townfhips  at  fo  great  a  diftance  to  be 
laid  out  at  once,  unlefs  they  were  more  peopled  ; 
which  has  fince  been  the  occafion  not  only  of  a 
vaft  Expence,  but  a  great  effufion  of  Blood. 

The  number  of  VelTels  were  about  fixteen 
which  the  Enemy  took  at  Canfo,  as  they  went  in- 
to the  Harbours  for  their  Neceffity  ;  which  fo 
foon  as  Governour  Fbilipps  was  apprifed  of,  he 
fummoned  the  feveral  Matters  alliore  with  the 
Sailors,  and  propofed  the  fitting  out  of  two  Sloops 
well  Man'd  for  recovering  the  VeiTels  and  Cap- 
tives, which  being  approved  of,  he  forthwith  or- 
dered the  Drums  to  beat  for  Volunteers,  and  in 
lefs  then  half  a  day  fix'd  them  out  with  about 
twenty  Men  in  each,  under  the  command  of 
Capt.  Elm  and  Capt*  Rohinfon,  who  freely  offered 
their  fervices ;  but  as  Capt.  Eliot  out  fail'd  the 
other,  he  got  firfl:  to  a  Harbour  call'd  PVinpague, 
where  he  difcovered  fome  Veffels,  and  bore  di- 
redly  down  upon  them,  'till  became  pretty  near. 
The  Indians  being  flufli't  with  Succefs,  and  having 
thirty  nine  on  board  one  of  the  Veffels  which 
they  had  took,  and  feeing  no  more  Men  on  board 
the  EngUjh  then  what  was  ufual,  commanded 
them  to  (trike  for  that  they  were  their  Prize.  Un- 
to whom  Capt.  Eliot  reply'd  that  he  was  haftning 
to  them  ;  and  in  an  inftant  called  his  Men  on 
Deck,  who  fired  on  them  with  a  loud  Huzza, 
and  clapt  them  on  board  ;  which  was  fo  furpri- 
fing  a  Salutation,  that  they  made  a  moft  dreadful 
yelling.  However  they  refifted  fo  well  as  they 
could  for  about  half  an  hour,  in  which  time 
Capt.  Eliot  received  three  Wounds,  when  Mr. 
Broddfireet,  who  commanded  the  Soldiers,  entrcd 

with 


(93) 

with  H^ni'GranaJo^,  mod  of  the  InJians  Jumpt 
ov^r-board,  who  were  (hot  in  the  Water.  Thofs 
that  ran  down  in  the  hold,  were  tore  in  pieces 
by  the  Shells,  fo  that  only  five  efcaped,  who  were 
wounded.  One  of  our  Men  was  kill'd,  and  feve- 
veral  hurt,  particularly  the  Corporal  of  the 
Troops,  who  had  five  Swan-fliot  in  his  Body. 
Cape.  Eliot  being  ill  of  his  Wounds,  was  obiig'd 
to  return,  carrying  wich  him  feven  VeiTels  into 
Canfo,  which  he  retook  with  fifteen  Captives,  fix 
hundred  Quintals  of  Fifh,  and  two  heads  of  the 
Chiefs  of  thofe  Indians  that  were  among  them. 
Upon  this  the  Governour  ordered  the  fame  Sloop 
back  with  a  frefli  fupply  of  Men  to  reinforce 
Capt.  Rohinfon,  who  in  a  Week  after  brought  ia 
two  Indian  Scalps,  a  Scooner  and  a  Sloop  which 
they  took  at  Mallegajh, 

After  that  he  met  with  a  French  Man  and  an 
Englifh  Captive,  who  informed  of  a  Body  of  Indi- 
ans and  f\\e  Veffels  thar  lay  at  a  little  difiance, 
which  he  immediately  went  in  purfuit  of;  buc 
fearing  the  event,  v/as  not  willing  at  firft  to  en- 
gage them,  but  kept  at  fome  diftance,  and  then 
three  Canoos  with  three  Indians  in  each  double 
arm'd  drew  near,  one  of  which  came  on  board, 
as  the  reft  lay  on  their  Paddles,  whom  they 
treated  friendly  in  expectation  of  a  greater  Prize. 
But  the  bidian  growing  jealous  attempted  to  ef- 
cape,  and  prefented  his  Gun  to  Lieut-  Jtphfcn\ 
breaft,  which  he  putting  by,  (hot  him  dead. 
Upon  this  they  fir'd  upon  thofe  in  the  Canoos, 
and  kill'd  three.  The  Enemy  was  fo  numerous 
adiore,  that  he  thought  it  not  fafe  to  encountep 
chera^  however  he  cock   one   Veffeh    At-  this 

time 


(94) 

time  they  had  twenty  of  our  Enilijh  Captives,  but 
could  not  come  to  a  fair  Capitulation  about  theii* 
Redemption.  However  the  Captain  warn  d  them 
to  ufe  them  well,  for  as  we  had  thirty  of  theirs  ac 
Annafolisy  twenty  at  Boflon,  and  as  many  more  at 
Canfoy  as  they  treated  ours,  fo  we  would  theirs. 
Mr.  BroaJfireet  now  ft^er'd  to  the  IVefi'n^ard  of  the 
Harboui  where  Capt.  Eliot  had  the  difpute  before 
mentioned,  where  he  retook  three  Veffels  more, 
but  could  fee  neither  Captive  nor  Indians.    The 
Day  after  Capt.  Blin  very  happily  arrived  with  a 
Flag  of  Truce,   and  redeemed  feven  Vefiels  and 
twenty  four  Captives,  who  otherwife  would  have 
been  put  to  Death.     From  thence  he  fail'd  to  the 
Cape^  and  in  his  returning  back,  took  three  or 
four  Indians,  which  he  carried  to  Bojion.     Capt. 
Sotithack   being  informed  of  a  fmall  Body  that 
was  then  at  A/lagena[l}  in   the  Gulph  of  St.  Law- 
rence, where  Monfieur  Goldm  the  famous  Fryar  did 
refide,  had  an  intent  to  vifit  him  ;  but  in  his  paf- 
fage  thro'  the  Gutc  was  happily  diverted,  where 
meeting  with  two  Canoos,  in  which  were  fix /»• 
dians  he  kiilM  one,  and  took  the  other  five. 

The  General  Affembly  not  finding  the  former 
Bounty  futhciently  encouraging  to  Volunteers, 
now  pafs'd  an  Ad  of  one  hundred  founds  a  Scalp  to 
all  fuch  as  fupporced  themfelves,  and  whoever

he  fhall  be  allowed  fuch  a  Stipend  or  Penfion  as 
the  General  Court  fhould  think  tit  to  order- 

September  the  loth  we  had  a  fiirprizing  Account 
from  Aro'wfick  of  four  or  five  hundred^  Canada  and 
Cape  Sable  Indians^   that   fell   upon  them  early  in 
the  Morning,   who  probably  would  have  laid  all 
defolate,  had  they  not  been  feafonably  difcover- 
ed  by  a  fmall  Guard  which  Cape  Fenhallo'n;  was 
fending  out  for  afliifting  the  Neighbourhood  to 
gather  in  the  Corn  3  who  kill'd  one  and  wounded 
three   more  of   the  Company ;    The   report  of 
which  Guns  did  fo  alarm   the  Inhabitants,  that 
they  with  moft  of  their  Subftance  got  feafonably 
into  the  Garrifon.     Their  firft  appearance  feem- 
ed  terrible,  confidering  their  Number,  with  the 
fewnefs  of  thofe  that  were  to  defend  ;  who  fought 
the  Garrifon  fome  time,  and  (hot  Samuel  Brooking 
thro'  a  Port-hole,  after  that  they  had  kill'd  fifty 
head  of  Cattle,   and  burnt   twenty  fix  dwelling 
Houfes.     The    fame    Day  in  the  Evening  came 
CoL  Walton  and  Capt.  Harmony  with  about  thirty 
Men   in  two   Whale-boats,  who  wich  thofe  of 
Capt-  Temple  and  ^enhaUo-w's  Men,  (that  could  be 
fpared  out  of  the  Garrifons)  made  about  feventy, 
and  gave  them  Battle  fome  time :  But  the  Ene- 
my were  fo  numerous,  that  they  were  like  to  have 
hem'd  tbem  in,  had  they  not  fought  upon  a  re- 
treat. 

In  the  Night  they  drew  off,  without  much 
caufe  of  Triumph,  and  went  up  the  River,  where 
they  attack:  Mr«  Stratton,  as  he  was  turning  down 

in 


in  his  Sloop,  whom  they  mortally  wounded ;  then 
went  to  Richmond^  where  fome  time  they  held  a 
difpure  with  the  Garrifon,  and  afterwards  drew 
oft'.     The  laft  that  fell  this  Seafon  was  a  Man  at 

His  Excellency's  Affairs  now  calling  him  to 
Great  Britain ,  the  Government  of  the  Majfachufetts 
was  wholly  devolved  on  the  Honourable  IVilliam 
Dimmer,  Efq,  Lieut.  Governour ;  during  whofe 
Adminiftration,  there  were  as  many  remarkable 
Turns  of  Divine  Trovidence,  frefpe&lt;fting  the  Ene- 
myj  as  have  happened  fince  the  War  commenced  ; 
whofe  Prudence  and  good  Condu(5t  have  made 
him  acceptable  unto  all. 

The  firft  Alteration  that  he  made,  was  in  Com- 
miffionating  Col.  IVeftbrook  as  Chief  in  xh^Eaficrn 
Affairs;  who  on  the  joih  oi  February  march'd 
to  Tenohfcot^  and  Capt.  Harmon  at  the  fame  time 
up  Amanafcoggin  River,  but  neither  of  them  had 
any  Succefs,  fave  burning  their  Chaff  el  and  fome 
Wigwams,  Capt.  Sayward  with  a  Company  of 
Voinnteers  went  as  far  as  the  White  Hills ^  tiQZt 
one  hundred  miles  into  the  Enemies  Country, 
bur  met  with  the  like  misfortune. 

So  foon  as  the  Spring  advanced,  they  began  to 
appear  as  furious  as  ever.  At  Scarborough  they 
kili'd  Thor/ias  Laribie  and  his  Son  ;  after  that  Mrs; 
Dering  and  two  Soldiers,  where  they  alfo  took 
Mar^  5cawondj  John  Hunuel  and  Robert  Jordan* 
Another  Party  came  to  Cocbecha,  where  they  flew 
TTifir4im  Head,  Jofeph  Ham,  and  carried  three 
Children  Captive  ;  From  thence  they  went  to 
Lamfer-Ele  River,  MMhzrt  thty  W\\V6i  Aaron  Raw- 
lim  with  one  of  his  Children,  carrying  iiway  his 

Wife 


Wife  and  three  more  with  chem.  At  NorthfieU 
they  fhot  two,  and  meeting  with  the  Reverend 
Mr.  IVtUard  of  Rutland^  they  laid  violent  Hands 
upon  him ;  but  he  being  a  Perfon  of  Courage  a- 
greeable  to  his  Strength^  he  flew  one  and  wound- 
ed another,  till  at  laft  they  gave  him  the  fatal 
ftroke.  Two  of  Enfign  Stephens's  Sons  were  ai- 
fo  kiil'd,  and  two  more  carried  Captive. 

Capt.  Watkins,  who  at  this  time  was  engaged 
on  a  JFifhing  Voyage  at  Canfo^  was  furprifed  by 
a  fmall  Body  in  the  Night  while  abed.  The 
Day  before  he  was  at  Church,  and  it  hapned 
that  two  Minifiers  in  two  different  Congregations 
preached  on  one  and  the  fame  Subject ;  namely, 
preparing  for  fudden  Death  ;  not  knowing  how  foort 
or  in  what  manner  Death  would  attack  them. 
His  Lodging  was  on  an  IJIand  at  a  little  diftance 
from  the  Fort;  and  altho'  he  was  fo  (Wrongly  im-^ 
portun'd  by  feveral  of  his  Friends  to  Itay  with 
them  that  Night,  as  if  they  had  a  fecret  impulfe 
of fome impending  Evil;  yet  all  the  Arguments 
they  could  ufe,  could  no  ways  prevail  nor  influ- 
ence him.  He  was  a  Gentleman  of  fingular  good 
Temper,  refpeded  and  lamented  by  all  chac 
knew  him.  John  Drew  of  Portfmouth  (r  pretty 
YouthJ  was  fiain  with  him,  at  the  fame  time. 

The  Delegates  of  the  fix  Nations  oUroquoife, 
with  the  Mohegan  and  Scatacook  Indians,  being 
difpofed  to  come  to  Boflon^  were  kindly  enter- 
tained there.  And  at  a  Conference  with  the 
General  /iffemhl)y  fignified  a  great  concern  for  the 
Blood  that  was  fo  often  flied  by  their  Kinfmen 
and  Brethren  ;  That  from  the  Original  they  were 
Friends  to  the  Engnfioy  and  as  a  Teftimony  of 
O  their 


(93) 
their  contkiuing  fo,  prefented  a  belt  ofWawpam  ; 
which  accordinp;  to  their  Cuftoni,  is  the  renew- 
ing the  Covenant.  His  Honour  the  Lieut.  Cover- 
nour^  as  an  acknowledgement,  gaive  each  of  them 
a  piece  of  iHat^^  wich  Figures  engraven  thereon, 
as  a  Turtle,  a  Bear^  a  Hatchet^  a  Wolf^  Sic.  which 
v;ers  the  Efcutcbeons  of  their  feveral  Tribes.  And 
the  more  to  oblige  them  to  our  Interefl,  they 
had  a  promife  made  of  one  htindrcd  pounds  a  Scalp 
for  every  Indian  that  they  kill'd  or  took ;  which 
feem'dfo  pje^^fing  to  them,  that  they  manifefted 
3  rendinefs  of  taking  up  the  Hatchet  in  favour  of 
the  Engliflj^  whenever  any  Hoftility  was  made 
agaift  Fhem.  After  this  they  were  entertained 
with  the  curious  fight  of  a  Gun  that  was  made 
by  the  ingenious  Mr.  Fim  of  Bojloft ;  which  altho' 
leaden  but  once^  yet  was  difchargM  eleven  times 
following  with  Bullets  in  the  fpace  of  two  mi- 
nutes ;  each  of  which  went  thro'  a  double  Door 
at  fifty  yards  didance.  They  were  then  prefen- 
ted with  an  Ox,  which  with  Bows  and  Arrows 
they  kiU'd  and  drefs'd  according  to  their  own 
Cuflom^  where  thoufands  of  Spedators  were 
prefent  to  behold  and  hear  their  barbarous 
Singing  and  Dancing.  But  notwithftanding 
this  free  and  generous  Entertainment,  with  the 
hrni  promifes  they  made  of  falling  on  our  Ene- 
mies, (whenever  they  made  any  Infults  on  us) 
ail  proved  of  little  or  no  Significancy  ;  which 
was  principally  owing  to  the  powerful  influence 
of  the  Dttfch^  for  the  fake  of  Trade  and  Comerce 
with  ihem,  as  was  obfcived  on  the  like  Occa- 
fion.

OBoher  the  thirteenth  we  had  an  account  from 
NorthfieUf  of  a  Body  of  Indians  that  fell  on  the 
Town-Fort,  where  they  wounded  two  and  kill'd 
as  many  more.  Soon  after  they  furprized  Mr. 
Cogjhel  and  his  Boats  Company  as  they  were  go- 
ing afhore  at  Mount  Defart, 

December  2  s^h.  about  fixty  laid  fiege  to  St.  Geor- 
ges Garrifon,  where  they  continued  thirty  Days, 
and  were  not  a  little  flufht  with  the  expedation 
of  Succefs  I  for  at  their  tirft  coming  they  took 
two  Soldiers,  who  gave  an  account  of  the  ftate 
of  Matters;  But  Mr.  Catjddy  the  commanding 
OfTicer  being  one  of  uncommon  Courage  and 
Refolution,  ftood  his  Ground  till  Col.  Wefthrook 
arrived,  who  fbon  put  them  to  a  rout.  Afcer 
this  fome  came  to  Berwick,  where  they  took  a 
Soldier  as  he  was  careiefly  wandering  from  the 
Garrifon- 

The  favourablenefs  of  the  Winter  prevented 
our  marching  to  any  of  their  Head  quarters  this 
Seafon,  excepting  to  Narridgwalk,  where  Capt- 
Moulton  found  a  vile  and  pernicious  Letter  from 
the  Governour  of  .^tcheck,  dire(51:ed  unto  the 
Fryar,  exhorting  him  to  pufli  on  the  Indians  vijth 
all  imaginable  Zeal  against  the  EngU^n,  whofe 
Advice  he  as  induftrioufly  purfued. 

Jfril  17th  1724-  tliey  Ihot  IVilliaw  Mitchd  of 
Scarhcrouglj,  as  he  vvas  plowing  in  the  Field,  and 
took  two  of  his  Sons,  who  afterward  were  re- 
leafed  at  the  taking  of  Narridgwalk-  They  then 
fell  on  a  Sloop  at  Kmehunk^  which  belonged  to 
Ljn,  and  kill'd  the  whole  Company:  But  the 
greateft  ftroke  was  on  Capt.  H^injioTv^  who  with 
fixteen  Men  in  two  Whale-boats,  went  from  St. 
O  2  George% 


r  loo  &gt; 

Ceorgcs  to  the  Greev-IJlands^  where  the  Enemy 
ufually  frequent  on  the  account  of  Fowling  But 
on  their  return  they  were  ambufcaded  by  two  or 
three  Companies  of  them  that  lay  on  each  fide 
the  River,  The  (irft  that  fell  was  Sergeant  Har- 
vejy  who  commanded  the  other  Boat ;  for  by 
keeping  too  near  the  Shore,  he  gave  the  Enemy 
the  greater  Advantage:  However  he  returned 
the  Shot  with  as  much  bravery  as  could  be  ex- 
pecfled,  till  overpowered  by  a  multitude.  Capt. 
IVinJlowy  who  was  confiderably  a- head  and  out 
of  danger,  perceiving  the  Engagement,  couragi- 
oufly  return  d  back  to  their  Affiftance,  But  be- 
fore he  could  give  them  any  relief,  was  furroun- 
ed  with  about  thirty  Canoos^  who  made  a  hide- 
ous yelling  ;  but  he  gave  them  no  anfwer  but 
from  the  muzzles  of  his  Guns.  A  fmart  Engage- 
ment followed,  which  held  till  Night:  When 
finding  his  Thigh  broken,  and  moft  of  his  Men 
fjain,  was  oblig'd  to  haften  afliore ;  but  there  al- 
io he  found  himfclf  unhappily  way- laid:  They 
fell  oji  him  with  utmoft  fury,  yet  his  Courage 
continued  until  the  laft  ;  for  (as  one  of  thofe  that 
efcapcd  has  fince  reported)  he  refted  himfelf  on 
bis  other  Knee,  and  kill'd  an  Indian  before  they 
had  power  to  flay  him.  Thus  died  that  worthy 
young  Gentleman,  for  the  Caufe  of  his  Country. 
He  was  *one  of  liberal  Education  and  good  Ex- 
trad,  being  the  Grand  Son  of  Governour/^/&gt;y?o2y 
of  Plymauth ;  and  if  he  had  furvived,  might  have 
been  of  good  Service  in  his  Generation.  Syl-

fame  day  alfo  kiird  by  another  Party,  and  his 
Son  was  carried  Captive.  A  few  Days  afier  they 
again  befetCapt.  Pcw/ja/W'sGarrifon,  where  they 
took  three  as  ihey  were  driving  their  Cows  to 
Pafturc,  and  at  their  drawing  off  kilPd  a  greac 
many  Cattle.  iVnother  Company  fe!l  on  Kings* 
towriy  where  they  took  Veter  Colcanl^  Ephraim  Se- 
zfernsy  and  two  of  Mr.  Stephens's  Children,  whom 
they  carried  to  Canada ;  but  by  the  unwearied 
Pains  and  Expence  of  Mr.  Stephens,  he  in  a  little 
time  purchafed  his  Children.  Colcard  about  fix 
Months  after  made  his  efcape  and  got  unto  his 
Friends,  out  did  not  fqrvive  long.  May  24th 
they  fhot  George  Cbejley  as  he  was  returning  from 
publick  VVorfliip,  with  whom  was  Elizabeth  Bur- 
Ttumy  who  was  mortally  wounded.  Three  Days 
after  they  went  to  T^erpocduck,  where  they  kill'd 
one  and  wounded  another,  and  then  march'd  to 
Saco^  where  they  flew  Da'uid  Hill  a  Friend  Indian, 
On  the  fame  Day  another  Party  went  to  Chefter, 
where  they  took  Thomas  Smithy  v/ich  another 
whom  they  pinion'd,  but  foon  after  they  made 
their  efcape. 

The  Frontiers  being  thus  alarmed,  two  Com- 
panies of  Volunteers  went  from  Newhawpjliire  on 
the  Bounty  A(5t  one  hundred  pounds  a  Scalp,  and  ic 
hapned  that  Mofes  DavM,  as  he  was  weeding  his 
Corn,  went  unto  a  Brook  to  drink,  where  he  faw 
three  Indian  Packs,  upon  which  he  informed  the 
Troops  that  were  then  coming  out.  He  with 
his  Son  went  before  as  guides,  but  by  an  Am- 
bufhment  were  both  fhot  dead.  The  Englijh 
then  fired  on  ihemj  who  kill'd  one,  and  wounded 
two  more,  but  could  not  find  eicher  of  the  latter, 

altho' 


(  10^  ) 
altho*  they  track't  them   hy    their  Blood  fomc 
way.     TheAiTembly  oi  Ncw-Hamp^mc  then  fit- 
ting, order'd  the  aforcfaid  Sura  of  one  hundred 
pounds  to  he  paid. 

The  next  damage  they  did,  was  at  Groton,  but 
were  fo  clofely  purfued,  that  they  left  feveral  of 
their  Packs  behind.  About  which  time  News  came 
to  DeerfieU  of  a  Body  of  Indians  difcover'd  up 
Conne6Ifcut  K'wer,  Cnpt- Thomas  JVeUs  Rallied  a 
Company  of  Men,  and  went  in  queft  of  them, 
but  made  no  further  Difcovery,  till,  upon  their 
return  home,  about  four  Miles  from  DeerfieU^  three 
of  the  Company  (fuppofing  themfelves  out  of 
DangerJ  Rode  at  fome  diftance  before  the  reft, 
and  unhappily  fell  into  an  Ambufliment  of  the 
Enemy  near  a  Swamp,  and  were  all  three  kill'd 
by  chem.  But  the  Company  behind,  hearing  the 
Guns,  rode  up  with  all  fpeed,  and  came  upon  the 
Enemy  while  they  were  fcalping  the  (lain  ;  and 
firing  upon  them  wounded  feveral.  Upon  which 
the  Enemy  fled  into  the  Swamp,  and  the  EttgUp) 
difmounting  their  Horfes,  ran  in  after  them,  and 
trackt  them  a  confiderable  way  by  the  Blood  of 
the  wounded,  but  found  none.  However  they 
recovered  ten  Packs,  and  heard  afterwards  that 
two  died  of  their  Wounds,  and  a  third  loft  the 
life  of  h&gt;s  Arm.  Another  Company  fell  on  Spur- 
vjivkj  where  rhey  mortally  wounded  Solomm  Jor^ 
iav^  as  he  was  coming  out  of  the  Garrifon.  Next 
day  being  ^uly  the  i8ch.  Lieut.  Bf^»  went  in 
queft  of  them,  and  came  up  with  a  Scout  of  thir- 
ty whom  he  engag'd  and  pur  to  flight,  leaving 
twenty  five  Packs,  twelve  Blankets,  a  Gun,  a 
H'Atchet^  and  fundry  other  things  behind  them. 

The 


(  I03  ) 

The  Enemy  not  finding   fo  great  encourag- 
menc  in  attacking  our  Frontiers  as  they  expected, 
were  now  refolved  to  turn  Pirates,  and  according- 
ly intercepted  feveral  of  our  Fifhery  as  they  went 
in  and  out  the  Harbours  for  Wood,  Water,  or  in 
cafe  of  Storms,  and  accordingly  made  up  a   Fleet 
of  fifty  Canoos,  who  defigo'd  at  firft  for  Monbe- 
gen,  but  going  thro,  the  Fox   Iflands,  and  feeing 
feveral  Veffels  at   Anchor,  furprized  eight   with 
little  or  no   Oppofition  ;  in  which  were  forty 
Men,  twenty  of  whom  they  put  to  Death,  refer- 
ving  the   Skippers   and  beft  Sailors  to  Navigate 
for  them.  After  this  they  took  fourteen  more  ;  &amp; 
with  the  afliftance  of  the  Cape  Sable  Indians,  be- 
came fo  powerful  and  defperate,  that  at  firft  they 
terrified  all   Veffels  that  fail'd   along  the  Eajhrn 
Shore.     They  then  went  to  St,  Georges  with  ade- 
fign  to    burn  that    Garrifon  ;  in  order   whereto, 
they  fiird  a  couple  of  Shallops  with  cumbuftible 
matter,  which  they  fet  on  fire,  but  it  was  happily 
extinguifbed.     They  then  offered  terms  on  far- 
rendering   which    were   rejeded.     And  finding 
that  neither  Force  nor  Infmuacion   would  prevail 
they  withdrew,  and  fail'd  to  Annapolis,  expeding 
to  furprize   the  Fort ;  but  firing  at  a  Soldier  in 
their  March,  gave  an  Alarm  ^  and  a  detachment 
iiTued  forth  ,  who  after  a  fmart  difpute  gave  them 
aperfed  rout,  but  not  without,  lofs  on  our  fide. 

The  Fi(hery  being  thus  invaded,  two  Shallops 
with  about  forty  Men  well  fixe  went  from  Ifew^ 
iampfijire,  who  fairly  came  up  with  one  of  them, 
but  thro'  Cowardize  and  Folly  were  afraid  to 
engage  them :  However  D^dor  Jack/on  from 
Kitfcry,  and  Sjlv^nvs  Lehman  from  Ipfwichy  with 


(  ^04  ) 

a  leffer  number  gave  them  Chafe,  and  fired  very 
fmartly  with  their  fmall  Arms,  altho'  the  Enemy 
had  two  great  Guns  and  four  Pateraroes,  which 
cue  their  Shrouds  and  hindred  their  purfuit  for 
fome  time :  But  being  fixed  again,  they  followed 
them  with  greater  Refolution,  and  drove  them 
into  Vettobfcot,  where  a  greater  Body  being  rea- 
dy to  cover  tuem,  he  was  forced  to  defift.  The 
Doctor  and  Mr.  Cutt  were  dangeroufly  wounded 
in  this  Engagement,  but .  Ibme  time  after  reco- 
vered. This  Storm  of  the  Enemy  by  Sea  pro- 
duced no  Calm  afliore- 

At  Rutland  they  kill'd  three  Men»  wounded 
one,  and  took  another ;  and  at  Oxford  befet  a 
Houfe  that  lay  under  a  Hill,  but  as  one  of  the 
Enemy  attempted  to  break  thro'  the  Roof,  he 
was  (hot  by  a  Woman  of  the  Houfe.  The  Sahbatb 
now  became  a  Day  of  Danger  in  which  they  of- 
ten did  Mifchief,  as  at  Dover^  Ojfier-Ri'ver  and 
Berwick,  where  they  kill'd  one,  wounded  a  fe- 
cond,  and  carried  away  a  third. 

Capt.  Harmon y  Moulton,  Brown  and  Bene,  were 
now  preparing  for  Naridgwalk  with  two  hun- 
dred Men  in  feventeen  Whale-boats.  After  they 
landed  at  Triconnick,  they  met  with  Bomaz,een  ac 
Bromfwick,  (who  had  llain  an  EngUjhman  fome 
days  before)  whom  they  fhot  in  the  River,  as  he 
attempted  to  make  an  afcape.  Thev  afterwards 
kill'd  his  Daughter,  and  took  his  Wife  Captive ; 
who  gave  an  account  of  the  ftate  of  the  Enemy, 
which  encouraged  them  to  march  on  briskly ;; 
and  on  Augufi  12th  they  got  within  two  miles 
of  the  place :  Capt.  Harmon  drew  off  with  about 
fixty  Men  to  range  their  Corn  fields,  in  hopes  of 

find- 


finding  fome  there,  imagining  they  faw  fome 
Smokes ;  while  Capt.  Moulton  with  about  an  hun- 
dred Men  moved  forward,  and   when  he  came 
within  view  of  the  Town,   artfully  divided  them 
into  three  Squadrons,  of  thirty  in  each  ;   having 
ordered  ten  to  guard  their  Baggage,  and  a  Squa- 
dron on  each  Wing  to  !ye   in  Ambufli,  while  he 
with  the  like  number  encountered   them   in   tho 
Front.  He  went  on  with  fuch  Refolution,  that  he 
got  within  Piftol  (hot  before  he  was  difcovered. 
The  Indians  were  under  amaTling  Terror ;  yet  in 
their  furprife  fome  of  them  fnatch'd  up  their  Guns 
and  fired  :  but  their  hands  lliook  and  ihey  did  no 
Execution.  They  immediately  betook  themfelves 
to  flight,  and  in  running  fell  on  the    very  muz- 
zles of  our   Guns    that   lay    in    Ambufli.     Our 
Men  puribed  them  fo  warmly,   that  feveral  were 
(l^in  on  the  fpot ;  more  got  into  their  Canoos,  &amp; 
others  ran  into  the   River ;   which  was  fo  rapid 
and  the  falls  in  fome  places  fo  great,  that  many 
of  them  were  drowned.     By  this  time  Capt-  Bar- 
mon  came  up,  whu  was  not  fo  happy  as  to  difco- 
ver  any  of  the  Enemy  where  he  expeded.     The 
number  of  the  dead  which  we  fcalpr,  were  twen- 
ty fix,befides  Mounfieur  Ralle  the  jeful^y  who  was 
a  Bloody  Incendiary,  and  Inftiumencal  to  mod 
of  the  Mifchiefs  that  were  done  us,  by  preaching 
up  the  Doiftrine  of  mericing  Salvation  by  the  de- 
ftruaion  of  Hereticks.  Some  fay  that  Quarter  was 
offered  him,  which  he  refufed  and  would  neither 
give  nor  take  any.     After  this  they  burnt  and  de- 
flroyed  the  Cbappel,  Canoos,  and  all  the  Cottages 
that  lay  round,  they  alfo  took  four  Indiatis   alive, 
and  recovered  three  Captives.  _

were  fuppofed  to  be  eighty,  but  fome  fay  more  j 
The  greateft  Vidory  we  have  obtained  in  the 
three  or  four  laft  Wars ;  and  it  may  be  as  noble 
an  Exploit  (all  things  confidered)  as  ever  hapned 
in  the  cims  of  King  Vhlilif,  About  feventy  French 
Mohawks  were  now  making  a  defcent  on  our 
Frontiers,  who  divided  into  feveral  Parties  and 
kill'd  a  great  number  of  Cattcl.  Some  of  them 
fell  on  the  Houfe  of  John  Hanfon  of  Dover^  who 
being  a  ftifF  Quaker,  full  of  Enthuiiafm,  and  ridi- 
culing the  Military  Power,  would  on  no  account 
be  influenced  to  come  into  Garrifon  ;  by  which 
means  his  whole  Family  (then  at  home,)  being 
eight  in  number,  were  all  kill'd  and  taken.  But 
fome  time  after  his  Wife  and  two  or  three  of  his 
Children  were  redeemed  with  confiderable  Pains 
and  Expence. 

September  4th.  they  fell  on  Dunfiabley  and  rook 
two  in  the  Evening,  next  morning  Lieut,  French 
with  fourteen  Men  went  in  queft  of  them ;  but 
being  way- laid,  both  he  and  one  half  of  his  Com- 
pany were  dcftroyed.  After  that  as  many  more 
of  a  frefh  Company  engaged  them,  but  the  Ene- 
my being  much  fuperior  in  number  overpowered

On  the  Monday  after  they  kill'd  Jabez,  Coleman 
of  Kingfiown,  with  his  Son,  as  they  were  gather- 
ing Corn  ftalks.  About  the  fame  time  Nathaniel 
Edwards  of  Northampton  was  kill'd.  And  the  next 
day  the  fame  Company  of  Indians  went  to  Wr/?- 
JulJ^  and  fell  on  feveral  People  as  they  were  conv«

en him,  but  fome  of  our  Men  bravely  faced  a- 
bout,  and  attempted  a  fliot  upon  them.  But  their 
Guns  all  miffing  fire  except  Mr.  Noab  Jjhley%  his 
went  off,  and  fliot  down  one  of  the  Enemy  ; 
which  put  a  flop  to  their  further  purfuit  of  the 
EngUp)  Hereupon  a  Company  Rallyed,  and 
went  after  the  Enemy,  and  quickly  found  the  7«- 
Jiatt  whom  Apdey  had  (lain.  And  taking  his 
Scalp,  faid  ^Jhley  brought  it  to  BofioHy  and  recei- 
ved one  hundred  Pounds  Reward  for  it.  And 
now  a  Regiment  of  frefli  Men  under  the  Com- 
mand of  Col.  Wejlbrook  were  preparing  for  Tenob^ 
fcot^  one  of  their  chief  places  of  randevous  for 
Planting  and  Fifhing;  but  by  the  unskilfulnefs  of 
his  Guides,  were  led  into  a  labyrinth  of  Difficul- 
ties, and  after  a  long  Fategue  return'd  without 
any  difcovery. 

Capt.  LoveweU  from  Dunftahle  with  thirty  Vo- 
lunteers, at  the  fame  time  went  North- wardy  who 
marching  feveral  Miles  up  the  Country  came  on 
a  IVigwam  wherein  were  two  Indians^  one  of 
which  they  kill'd  and  the  other  took,  for  which 
they  received  the  promifed  bounty  of  one  hundred 
founds  a  Scalp,  and  two  Shillings  and  fix  pence  a  day 
befides. 

Ocher  Companys  were  difpofed  to  go  out  on 
the  like  encouragment,  but  did  not  fee  the  track 
of  2in  Indian;  being  under  fuch  amazing  Terror, 
by  reafon  of  their  lare  overthrow  at  Naridgwalk^ 
that  they  deferted  their  former  Habitation  ;  for 
when  Capt.  Heath  went  to  Penohfcot,  he  made  no 
other  difcovery  than  a  few  empty  Wigwams,

The  Government  (being  thorowly  apprized  of 
the  perfidy  of  the  French  at  Canada,  in  lupplying 
the  Indians  with  all  neceffary  ftores  of  War,  not- 
withftanding  the  Peace  at  Utrecht,  fo  firmly  rati- 
fied between  the  two  Crowns)  fent  Col.  Tbaxter 
and  Col.  Dudley  from  the  Majfachufets,  with  Mr. 
Athnfon  from  New  Hamfhire^  as  Commiffioners  to 
reprefent  the  many  Grievances  that  arofe  there- 
by ;  As  aifo  to  demand  the  feveral  Captives  which 
they  had  of  ours,  and  that  hence  forward  they 
would  withdraw  all  manner  of  afliftance  from  the 
Enemy ;  for  as  they  were  Indians  bordering  be- 
tween both  Governments,  they  belonged  either 
to  the  Dominion  of  Great  Britain,  or  unto  the 
French  King  ;  if  to  the  French  King,  then  confe- 
quently  they  were  his  Subje^s,  and  the  encou- 
raging or  fupplying  them  with  warlike  Stores  a- 
gainft  the  Engli^,  was  a  flagrant  violation  of  the 
Teace  between  the  two  Crowns ;  if  they  belonged 
to  the  King  of  Great  Britain^  then  the  exciting 
them  to  War  was  as  great  a  breach,  and  a  ftiring 
them  up  to  Rebellion,  contrary  unto  their  Alle- 
giance and  Submiffion  in  the  year  169;.  which 
was  afterwards  renewed  in  the  year  171;.  and 
1717, 

Our  Gentlemen  in  their  Journey  to  ^eheck, 
met  the  Governour  at  Mount  Real  unto  whom 
they  delivered  tliis  Meffage  :  Upon  which  the 
Governour  feem'd  to  extenuate  his  fupplying  or

they  made  it  evident  from  Letters  under  his  HancJ 
ynto  Mounfieur  Raliee  the  Jefuit  and  Father  Con- 
feffour.  But  to  palliate  the  Matter  he  reply 'd. 
They  were  an  Indefendant  Nation^  and  that  as  the 

Cap*

Captives  were  out  of  his  reach  he  would  not  en- 
gage therein.  But  as  to  thofe  among  the  French 
he  would  order  them  to  be  releafed  npon  paving 
the  firft  Coft  that  they  had  given  the  Indians-  This 
we  were  oblig'd  to  do,  after  an  exorbitant  man- 
ner ;  and  in  the  whole  got  but  Hxteen  with  the 
promife  of  ten  more.  Notwithftanding  this  he 
would  often  refled  on  the  EngUfh  for  invading  the 
Properties  of  the  Indians,  till  our  Commiffioners 
demonftrated  that  we  poffefs'd  no  more  than 
what  we  purchafed,  and  had  formerly  inhabited  ; 
and  in  as  much  as  the  Boundaries  between  the 
Two  Crowns  were  firmly  fixt,  that  all  the  Indians 
inhabiting  this  fide  V  Accadia^  muft  of  confe* 
quence  belong  to  the  Crown  of  Great  Britain. 
After  this  our  Gentlemen  departed,  acknowledge 
.ing  the  kind  Entertainment  which  his  Excellency 
had  given  them  ;  who  order'd  a  Guard  to  attend 
them  part  of  their  way  home. 

But  the  difficulties  and  hazards  that  they  met 
with  in  their  Journey  were  great  and  terrible. 
It  took  them  full  four  Months.  The  Lake  they 
paffed  over  was  a  hundred  and  fifty  miles  long,  and 
thirty  wide,  which  was  covered  with  Water 
four  inches  on  the  furface  of  the  Ice*  The  firft 
place  they  came  to  was  Shamhlee,  where  is  a 
ftrong  Fortification  200  foot  fquare,  and  50  foot 
high,  with  four  Baftions,  in  which  are  four  teer 
of  Guns  one  above  another.  From  thence  they 
travelled  to  Mount  Real,  which  is  an  Ifland  of 
50  miles  long  and  12  wide,  lying  in  the  middle 
of  the  River  commonly  called  St.  Lawrences  Ri* 
ver  ;  about  180  miles  up  from  ^eheck,  naviga- 
ble for  Veffds  of  about  loo  Tons,   This  City 

(of 


(of  Mount  Real)  lies  near  the  middle,  walled  round 
with  Stone  and  Lime  i6  foot  high  and  j  thick  ; 
but  no  Battery  or  Fortification ;  in  which  arc 
three  Churches,  two  Chappels,  two  Nunneries, 
and  two  Streets  of  three  quarters  of  a  mile  in 
length ;  containing  about  400  Houfes.  Their 
Trade  is  moftly  in  Furs,  wnich  they  tranfporc  to 
^ehecky  and  from  thence  to  France, 

Capt.  LoveweSy  who  was  endowed  with  a  ge- 
nerous Spirit  and  Refolution  of  ferving  his  Coun- 
try, and  well  acquainted  with  hunting  the  Woods, 
raifed  a  new  Company  of  Volunteers,  &amp;  march- 
ed fome  miles  beyond  their  common  Head- quar- 
ters :  On  the  Eafierly  fide  of  Wimefiffocay  Ponds 
he  crofs*d  an  Indian  Track,  and  foon  after  ef- 
pied  two  of  them,  whofe  Motions  he  watch'd  all 
the  Day,  and  at  Night  filently  came  upon  them 
as  they  lay  afleep  round  their  Fire.  At  his  firft 
firing  he  kill'd  feven^  after  that  two  more,  and 
wounded  another,  which  was  their  whole  Com- 
pany :  Who  being  within  a  Day  and  halfs  march 
of  our  Frontiers,  would  probably  have  done  Mif- 
chief,  had  they  not  been  fo  feafonably  prevent- 
ed. Their  Arms  were  fo  new  and  good,  that 
mod  of  them  were  fold  for  fevtn  founds  apiece, 
and  each  of  tham  had  two  Blankets,  with  a  great 
many  fp.ire  Moggafonsy  which  were  fuppofed  for 
the  (iipplying  of  Captives  that  they  expelled  to 
have  taken.  The  Plunder  was  but  a  few  Skins  ^ 
but  during  the  March  our  Men  were  well  en- 
tertained with  Moofe^  Bear,  and  Deer ;  together 
wich  Salmon  Trout,  fome  of  which  were  three  foot 
long  J  and  weighed  twelve  founds  apiece.

(Ill) 

April  ijth.  172 f.  there  came  two  Indians  to 
Adac^uoit^  and  took  one  Cockram,  a  Soldier  of  a- 
bout  eighteen  years  of  Age,  whom  they  carried 
thirty  Miles  into  the  Woods.  The  firft  nighc 
they  pinioned  him,  but  left  him  loofe  the  fecond. 
He  took  an  opportunity  ('as  they  were  afleep,)  to 
knock  them  both  on  the  head,  Scalpt  'em  and 
brought  their  Scalps  away  with  him,  and  their 
Guns.  But  in  his  return  he  was  fo  unhappy  as 
to  loofe  a  Gun,  and  one  of  the  Scalps,  in  fording 
over  a  River  When  he  came  to  the  Garrifon 
and  gave  an  account  of  the  whole  affair,  there 
went  out  a  Party  the  next  Morning  and  found  the 
Indians  both  dead  according  to  the  information 
that  he  had  given  He  was  not  only  rewarded 
according  to  the  ASi^  but  was  advanced  in  his 
Poft,  for  his  brave  Adion,  and  for  the  encourag- 
menc  of  others. 

On  the  Monday  after  came  another  Party  to 
Tarntouth,  where  they  flew  William  and  Adathew 
Scalesy  which  was  a  great  weakning  to  that  Gar- 
rifon, being  very  adtive  and  induftrious  Men,  and 
the  principal  fupporters  thereof. 

After  this  they  went  to  Cape-Porpos  and  way- 
laid Lieut.  Trefcott  with  feme  others,  as  they  were 
paffing  along  the  Road,  whom  they  fired  on,  and 
wounded  the  faid  Trefcott  in  feveral  places, 

A  Veflel  from  Canfo  about  this  time  arriving, 
brought  an  account  of  feventy  Indians  that  fcH 
on  an  Ouc-houfe  in  view  of  the  Garrifon,  where 
they  kill'd  feven  Men,  one  Woman  and  a  Child, 
and  from  thence  went  to  Capt.  DureH's  Ifland^ 
where  they  befet  a  fortified  Houfe  in  which  were 
only  four,  who  engag'd  them  fevewl  Hours  j  one 

of 


&lt;  m  } 

of  which  was  in  a  little  time  fhot  thro'  a  loop- 
hole, but  the  remaining  three  held  out  and  defen- 
ded themfelves  with  fuch  bravery,  that  the  Ene- 
my was  obliged  to  draw  off  with  confiderable 
lofs. 

Capt.  Love-well  being  ftill  animated  with  an 
uncommon  zeal  of  doing  what  Service  he  could, 
made  another  attempt  on  Pigwackett  with  forty 
four  Men  ;  who  in  his  going  built  a  fmall  Fore 
near  Offi^y,  to  have  recourfe  unto  in  cafe  of  dan- 
ger, as  alfo  for  the  relief  of  any  that  might  be 
fick  or  wounded  •  and  having  one  of  his  Men  at 
this  time  fick,  he  left  the  Dohor  with  eight  Men 
more  to  guard  him  :  With  the  reft  of  his  Com- 
pany he  proceeded  in  queft  of  the  Enemy,  who 
on  May  the  8th  about  lo  in  the  Morning,  forty 
miles  from  faid  Fort,  near  Saco  Pond,  he  faw  an 
Indian  on  a  point  of  Land  :  Upon  which  they 
immediately  put  ofFiheir  Blankets  and  Snapfacks, 
and  made  towards  him^  concluding  that  the 
Enemy  were  a-head  and  not  in  the  rear.  Yet 
they  were  not  without  fome  Apprehenfions  of 
their  being  difcovered  two  days  before,  and  that 
the  appearing  of  one  Indian  in  fo  bold  a  manner, 
Was  on  purpofe  to  enfnare  them-  Wherefore 
the  Captain  calling  his  Men  together,  propofed 
whether  it  Was  beft  to  engage  them  or  not ;  who 
boldly  reply'd,  That  as  they  came  out  on  furfofe  to 
meet  the  Enemy ^  they  would  rather  trufi  Providence 
with  their  Lives  and  die  for  their  Country^  than  return 
without  feeing  them-  Upon  this  they  proceeded 
and  mortally  Wounded  the  Indian ^  Who  norwith- 
ftanding  returned  the  Fire,  and  wounded  Capt. 
Lovewell  in  the  Belly ;  Upon  which  Mr,  fVyman 

fired 


C  "3  ) 

fired  and  killM  him-  But  their  difmantHng  thciti- 
felves  at  this  juiK^ure  proved  an  unhappy  fnare; 
for  the  Enemy  taking  their  Baggage,  kneW  their 
ftrengthby  the  number  of  their  Packs,  where  they 
lay  in  ambufh   till  chey  returned,  and  made  the 
firft  (hot ;  Which  our  Men  anfwered  with  much 
bravery,  and  advancing  within  twice  the  length 
of  their  Guns,  flew  nine  :     The  Encounter  was 
fmart  and  defperate,  and  the  Vi&lt;5lory  feem'd  to 
be  in  our  favour,  till  Capt.  Loveweli   wich  feveral 
more  were  flain  and  Wounded,  to  the  number  of 
twelve :    Upon  W-hich   our  Men  Were  forced  to 
retreat  unto  ^  Pond,  between  which  and  the  E- 
nemy  was  a  ridge  of  Ground  that  proved  a  Bar- 
rier unto  us.     The  Engagement  continued  ten 
hours,  but  altho*  the  fliouts  of  the  Enemy  were 
at  firft  loud  and  terrible,  yet  after  fome   time 
they  became  fenfibly  low    and  weak,  and  their 
appearance  to  leffen  :  NoW  whether  it  Was  tlW 
Want  of  Ammunition,  or  on  the  account  ofthcfe 
that  Were   flain  and  wounded,  that  the  Enemy 
retreated;      certain  it   is    they  firft    drew    off 
and  left  the  Ground  :     And  altho'   many  of  our 
Men  Were  much  enfeebled  by  reafon  of  their 
Wounds,   yet  none  of  the  Enemy  purfaed  ihsm 
in  their  return.     Their  number   Was  uncertain, 
but  by  the  advice  which  we  afterwards  received, 
they  'WQrQ  [event)  in  the  whole,  whereof /orf;  were 
faid  to  be  kill'd   upon   the  fpot,  eighteen  more  di- 
ed of  their  Wounds,   and  that    twdve   only  re- 
turned.    An  unhappy  inftance   at  this  time  fell 
out  rcfpeAing  one  of  our  Men,  who  when  the 
Fight  began   Was  fo  dreadfully  terrified,  that  h« 
ran  aWay  unto  the  Fort,  telling  thofc  who  we/e 
Q  thcvvci 


C"4) 

there,  that  Capt.  LovewtU  was  kiird  with  moft  of 
his  Men  ;  which  put  them  into  fo  great  a  Con- 
fternaiion,  that  ihey  all  drew  off,  leaving  a  bag 
of  Bread  and  Pork  behind,  in  cafe  any  of  their 
Company  might  return  and  be  in  diftrefs. 

The  whole  that  we  loft  in  the  Engagement 
were  fifteeity  befides  thofe  that  were  wounded. 
EUax^er  Davis  of  Concord  was  the  [aft  that  got  in, 
who  firft  came  co  Berwick  and  then  to  Portfmouth, 
w!"iere  he  was  carefully  provided  for,  and  had  a 
skilful  Surgeon  to  attend  him.  The  Report  he 
gave  me  was,  That  after  Czpi*  Lovewell  was  killed, 
and  Lieut.  Farewell  and  Mr-  Rohhins  wounded, 
that  Enfign  Wyman  took  upon  him  the  command 
of  the  (hattered  Company,  who  behaved  himfelf 
with  great  Prudence  and  Courage,  by  animating 
the  Men  and  telling  them,  That  the  Day  would  yet 
he  their  own,  if  their  Spirits  did  not  flag  ;  which  en- 
liven'd  them  anew,  and  caufed  them  to  fire  fo 
briskly,  that  feveral  diicharged  between  twenty 
and  thirty  times  apiece.  He  further  added,  that 
Lieut-  Farewell^  with  Mr-  Fry  their  Chaplain,  Jo* 
fiah  Jones,  and  himfelf,  who  were  all  wounded, 
march'd  towards  the  Fort ;  but  Jones  fteer'd  ano- 
ther way,  and  after  a  long  fategue  and  hardfliip 
got  fafe  into  Saco,  Mr.  Fry  three  days  after,  thro* 
the  extremity  of  his  Wounds,  began  to  faint  and 
languifti,  and  died.  He  was  a  very  worthy  and 
promiiing  young  Gentleman,  the  bud  of  whofe 
Youth  was  but  juft  opening  into  a  Flower. 

Mr.  "Jacob  Fullam,  who  was  an  Officer  and  an 
only  Son,  diftinguifh'd  himfelf  with  much  brave- 
ry. One  of  the  firft  that  was  kill'd  was  by  his 
hand ;  and  when  ready  to  encounter  a  fecond, 

it's 


(  "J  J 

ic's  faidj  that  he  and  his  Adverfary  fell  at  the 
very  inftanc  by  each  others  Shot.  Mr-  Farewell 
held  out  in  his  return  till  the  eleventh  d^y  ;  du- 
ring which  time  he  had  nothing  to  eat  but  Wa- 
ter and  a  few  Roots  which  he  chewed  ;  and  b/ 
this  time  the  Wounds  thro'  his  Body  were  fo 
mortified,  that  the  Worms  made  a  thorow  Paf- 
fage.  The  fame  day  this  Davts  caught  a  Fifh 
which  he  broil'd,  and  was  greatly  refrefh'd  there- 
with 5  but  the  Lieut,  was  fo  much  fpent,  that 
he  could  not  tafte  a  bit,  Davis  being  now  alone 
in  a  melancholy  defolate  ftate,  ftill  made  toward 
the  Fort,  and  next  day  came  to  it,  where  he  fonnd 
fome  Pork  and  Bread,  by  which  he  was  enabled 
to  return  as  before  mentioned. 

Juft  as  I  had  finifhed  this  Account,  I  faw  the 
Hijhrical  Memoirs  of  the  ingenious  Mr.  Symmes, 
wherein  I  find  two  things  remarkable,  which  I 
had  no  account  of  before  :  One  was  of  Lieut. 
Robins^  who  being  fenfible  of  his  dying  ftate,  de- 
fired  one  of  the  Company  to  charge  his  Gun 
and  leave  it  with  him,  being  perfwaded  that  the 
Indians  by  the  Morning  would  come  and  fcalp 
him,  but  was  defirous  of  killing  one  more  be- 
fore he  died.  The  other  was  of  Solomon  Kies^ 
who  being  wounded  in  three  places,  loft  fo  much 
Blood  as  difabled  him  to  ftand  any  longer ;  but 
in  the  heat  of  the  Battle,  calling  to  Mr.  IVyman 
faid,  he  was  a  dead  Man  ;  however  faid  that  if 
it  was  poffible  he  would  endeavour  to  creep  into 
fome  obfcure  hole,  rather  than  be  infulted  by 
thefe  bloody  Indians :  But  by  a  ftrange  Provi- 
dence, as  he  was  creeping  away,  he  faw  a  Ca- 
noo  in  the  Pond&gt;  which  he  roll'd  himfeif  into, 

and 


(  ii&lt;s ) 

ond  by  a  favourable  Wind  (without  any  affidance 
of  his  own^  was  driven  fo  many  miles  on,  that 
he  got  fafe  unto  the  Fort. 

In  I  Sam,  ;i.  ii,  12,  i  j.  it  is  recorded  to  the 
immortal  Honour  of  the  Men  of  Jakefh  GileaJ, 
that  when  fome  of  their  renowned  Heroes  fell  by 
the  hand  of  the  Tbiliftwes,  that  they  prepared  a 
decent  Burial  for  their  Bodies. 

Now  fo  foon  as  the  Report  came  of  Capt. 
LovewtU'%  defeat,  about  fifty  Men  from  NeW' 
bampflnre  well  equipt,  marched  unto  Tigwackett 
for  the  like  end,  but  were  not  fo  happy  as  to 
find  them  :  But  Col.  T^ng  from  Dunfiahle,  with 
Opt.  White  who  went  afterwards,  buried  twelve  j 
where  at  a  little  diftance  they  found  three  Indi^ 
tns^  among  whom  was  "Paugus,  a  vile  and  bloody 
Wretch.  Now  the  reafon  why  no  more  of  the 
E.nemy  could  be  found,  was  becaufe  it's  cuftoma- 
ry  among  them  to  conceal  their  dead,  and  bury 
them  in  fome  places  of  obfcurity. 

Give  me  leave  here  again  to  relate  (as  I  did 
before  refpci^ing  Col.  Hilton)  that  fix  or  eight 
Days  before  Capt-  Lovewell  was  defeated,  we  had 
a  current  Report  feveral  miles  round  of  his  being 
fo,  wirh  iiftle  or  no  variation  both  as  to  Time 
and  Circumftances. 

Our  encountering  the  Enemy  at  iuch  a  di- 
(lance  was  fo  terrible  and  furprizing,  that  they 
never  found  any  body  after-  And  tho'  our  Acti- 
ons in  this  War  can  bear  no  comparifon  with 
thofe  of  our  Britijh  Forces,  (which  have  caufed 
the  World  to  wonderj  yet  not  to  mention  the 
bravery  of  thefe  Worthies,  who  died  in  the  Bed 
of  Honour,  and  for  the  intcreft  of  their  Coun-

ny brave  Men  under  the  Command  of  Capt. 
White,  Capt.  IVyman,  and  others  went  out,  but 
the  Extremity  of  the  Heat  prevented  their 
Marching  far.  Many  of  them  fickned  of  tnc 
Bloody  Flux,  and  fome  dyed  after  therr  return ; 
particularly  Capt.  White  and  Capt.  IVymany  whofe 
Deaths  were  very  much  lamented. 

Saquarexisy  and  Nebine,  one  a  Hoflage  and  the 
other  a  Prifoner  belonging  to  the  Englijh,  being 
defirous  of  vifiting  their  old  Acquaintance,  had 
liberty  granted  them  on  their  Varole ;  who  after 
fome  time  returned  and  gave  an  Account,  that  the 
Indians  were  generally  difpofed  to  a  Peace,  for 
that  the  lotfes  they  met  with,  and  the  daily  Ter- 

tour 


four  they  were  onder  m^de  their  lives  mUerable. 
After  this  they  went  out  ngain,  and  meetiiig  with 
feveral  others,  they  reprefented  their  ready  defires 
of  having  a  Treaty  of  Pacification  wirh  the  Englijh. 
Upon  which  Col.  fVahdn,  from  New-Hamfjinret 
Col.  Stoddard  and  Mr.  iVainwrighs,  from  the  Maf- 
facbtifets,  were  appointed  Commiflioners  to  go 
unto  St.Georgn to  hear  and  report  what  they  had 
to  offer.  They  arrived  there  July  the  fecond, 
and  fent  the  faid  two  Indians  with  a  Letter  unto 
their  Chiefs,  letting  them  know  that  they  were 
come ;  who  in  fix  days  after  appeared  under  a 
Flag  of  Truce. 

Capt.  Bean  the  Interpreter  was  fent  to  meet 
them.  They  brought  a  Letter  from  IVinnenim^ 
ntit  their  Chief  Sagamore,  which  was  wrote  in 
French*  The  import  of  which  was  to  congratu- 
late the  GentUmens  Arrival  on  a  defign  of  Veace, 
which  they  earneftly  defired  to  treat  about,  pro- 
vided they  might  do  it  fafely  j  being  under  fome 
fear  and  Jealoufly.  And  indeed  they  had  Caufe 
of  being  fo,  for  chat  about  ten  days  before  under 
a  Flag  of  Truce,  fome  of  the  Engltjh  Treache- 
roufly  attempted  to  lay  violent  Hands  upon  them, 
but  loft  one  in  the  Skirmifli,  and  had  another 
wounded,  which  was  the  occafion  of  the  like  un- 
happy difafter  that  afterwards  hapued  unto  Capt. 
Saunderj  in  Fenobfcot  Bay.  They  then  moved, 
that  in  as  much  as  many  of  their  Men  were  fcat- 
tered,  (being  out  a  hunting)  that  our  Gentlemen 
would  ftay  a  little,  which  they  confented  to.  And 
five  days  after,  Seven  came  in  under  a  Flag  of 
Truce,  making  the  ufoal  fignal  j  and  informing 
the  Commiflioneis  they  would  wait  on  thejm  to 


(  xr?  ) 

Morrow  ;  who  after  a  friendly  Entertainment 
were  difmift-    The  next  day  their  whole  Body 
came  wirhin  a  quarter  of  a  Mile  of  the  Garrifon 
defiring  the  Englllh  to  come  to  them  ;  which  they 
refufed,   faying,  that  they   were  fent  from  the 
feveral  Governments   to  hear   what  they   had  to 
offer;  but  aflured  them  that  if  they  came  to  them 
no  injury  fhould  be  offered-     After  a  fliort  con- 
fulration  they  comply'd,  provided  that  the  Englifh 
would  engage  it  i»  the  Name  of  God.     And  then 
they  fent  in  thirteen  of  their  Chiefs,  expe&lt;fling 
the  like  number  of  Englijh  to  be  fent  them.    So 
foonasthey  met,  the  Commiffioners  demanded 
what  they  had  to  offer,  who  complimented  rheni 
with  the  great  fatisfac^ion  they  had  in  feeing 
them  in  fo  peaceable  a  difpofition,  and  that  it  was 
alfo  the  intent  and  defire  of  their  hearts.    It  was 
then  ask'd   wherefore  they  made  War  upon  the 
Englifl)  &gt;  Who  replied,  becaufe  of  their  Encroach- 
ments upon  their  Lands  fo  far-  IVtflward  as  Cafe- 
Nawagen,  where  two  of  their  Men  as  they  faid 
were  beaten  to  Death.    Unto  which  'twas  an- 
fwered,  That  that  very  Land  was  bought  by  the 
Englifij,  and  that  the  Deeds  from  their  Predecef- 
fours  were  ready  to  be  fliewn  ;  And  admitting  it 
was  true  what  they  faid,  that  the  EngUflj  did  fo 
inhumanly  beat  two  of  their  Indians,  yet  it  was 
not  juftifiable  in  them  (according  to  the  Articles 
of  Peace^  to  commence  a  War  at  once,  without 
firft  making  Application  to  the  Government^  who 
at  all  times  were  ready  to  do  them  juftice. 

This  Conference  being  over,  they  propos'd  a 
further  TVw^/ i  which  after  fome  debate  was  re- 
folved  to  be  at  Bo/lon,    They  then  moved  for  a 

CefMhon 


(  »io  ) 

Ceffation  of  Arms ^  but  our  Commlflioners,  having 
no  power,  replied,  that  if  they  went  to  Bofion  it 
might  probably  be  granted.  But  in  the  mean 
time  moved  that  each  Party  (hould  be  on  their 
Guard,  for  that  it  was  the  Cuftom  of  Nations  to 
carry  on  the  War  on  both  fides  till  matters  were 
fully  concluded.  The  Indians  reply'd  that  as  they 
defined  Peace,  they  were  refolved  on  calling  in 
their  young  Men,  promifing  for  themfelves  and 
thofe  alfo  of  their  Trihe^  that  no  Hoftiiity  (hould 
be  formed  againft  us. 

The  Treaty  being  over,  Capt  Loran  and  Aban- 
quidy  who  were  two  of  their  Chiefs,  accompani- 
ed our  Gentlemen  to  Bojlony  where  they  were 
friendly  Entertained,  and  after  a  Capitulafion  of 
matters,  return'd  in  a  Veffel  prepared  pn  purpofe, 
with  a  promife  of  bringing  more  of  their  Chiefs 
with  them  in  forty  days  after  their  arrival,  for  a 
final  Iffue  of  all  differences. 

Several  Conftru&lt;aions  andCenfures  were  pafs'd 
on  this  Trtaty ;  fome  thinking  the  EngUjh  were 
more  forward  for  a  Peace  than  the  Indiansy  and 
that  as  we  now  knew  their  head  quarters,  might 
eafily  deftroy  their  Corn,  and  difreft  them  in 
their  Fifliery,  which  would  bring  them  to  a  ready 
compofition.  Altho'  the  "^cnobfcot  Indians  feem'd 
Guarantte  for  the  other  Tribes,  yet  as  wc  knew 
them  Treacherous,  we  could  put  no  confidence 
in  them,  but  rather  lay  our  felves  open  unco  a 
Snare,  and  become  the  more  fecure!  Something 
like  this  accordingly  fell  out  ^  for  on  Septemher 
lyth  a  Party  of  them  fell  on  fome  of  Cocbecba 
while  at  work  in  the  Field,  where  they  flew  one, 
Scalpt  another^  cut  off  (be  Head  of  a  third,  and 

carried 


C  "I  ) 

carried  a  fourth  Captive  ;  all  which  belong'd  to 
the  Family  of  the  Evam'a. 

A  few  days  after  another  Party  attacked  a  Gar- 
rlfon  at  North  Tarmoutb,  but  were  fo  ftoutly  re- 
pulfed  that  they  made  no  impreffion  j  but  at  their 
drawing  off,  kitl'd  feveral  Cactel.  Two  days  af- 
ter fome  appeared  at  Mowfum  and  then  at  Dama^ 
rts  Cove,  which  lies  Eafiward  of  Kenneheck^  and  is 
two  Leagues  within  the  line  agreed  upon ;  where 
they  took  and  burnt  two  Shallops  which  belong- 
ed to  Stephen  Hunuel^  and  Alexander  Soafer,  whom 
with  five  Men  and  a  Boy,  they  carried  to  the 
Winniganfe,  and  knockt  him  oq  the  head.  Some 
conjexStured  thefe  Indianf  came  from  Canada^  o- 
thers  that  they  belong'd  to  th&amp;  Eafiward^  for  chat 
an  EngUjh  Jacket  was  afterwards  feen  on  ons  of 
them  j  biJt  tlie  Eafierrt  Indians  laid  it  on  the  Q- 
ther. 

At  the  fame  time  the  EngUfl)  had  feveral  Com- 
panies out,  as  at  Amarafcogginy  Rockamagug,  Na" 
rtdgwalky  izz.  Where  Col  Hannott  and  others 
went,  but  made  no  difcovery.  Some  thought 
that  IVs  hereby  infringed  on  the  Articles  made  be- 
tween rhem  and  us,  unto  which  it  may  be  rcph^ 
ed,  that  thefe  places  were  not  within  the  "TenGl- 
foot  Line  ;  and  altho'  they  promised  to  do  what 
they  could  in  reftraining  others  from  falling  on 
the  EngJifh,  yet  as  feveral  Scouts  from  other 
Places  w^re  then  our,  they  could  not  abfoluteiy 
engage  foj:  them ,  Wherefore  it  was  now  requi- 
fite  for  us  to  fecure  our  Frontiers, 

About  the  28th  Septemher  1725-  Capt  Bwight  of 

Fort  Dimtmer  fent  out   a  Scout  of  fix  Men  ^c/?* 

who  treing  upon  their  return  fat  down  to  Refrefh 

R  them^ 


themfdvesj  and  hearings  noife  like  Runing, 
looked  up,  and  faw  fourteen  Indians  juft  upon 
them.  Our  Men  fired  at  the  Enemy,  but  were 
foon  over  powr'd  by  the  Indians^  who  kill'd  two, 
took  three  and  one  efcaped. 

The  forty  days  before  mentioned  for  coming 
in  of  the  Femhfcot  Indians^  with  thofe  of  the  other. 
Tribes  being  near  twice  expired,  gave  great  un- 
eafmefs  for  fear  of  fome  Mifchief  that  was  defign- 
ed.  But  in  the  beginning  of  Novemhery  the  feveral 
Captains  hereafter  mentioned  came  in,  ^/ss.

General  Affembly,  December  ly.  172  j. 

Atteft 

J.  Willard,  Sect. 

Thus  we  have  feen  the  Events  of  twenty  three 
Years,  in  moft  of  which  we  have  heard  nothing 
but  the  found  of  the  Trumpet,  and  the  alarm  of  War. 
And  in  the  time  of  the  intervening  Peace,  we 
met  with  many  Interruptions  and  Ads  of  HoAi- 
lity,  which  prevented  the  growth  of  our  Eafiern 
Settlements. 

Ic*s  furprizing  to  think  that  fo  fmall  a  num- 
ber of  Indians  Ihould  be  able  to  diftrefs  a  Coun- 
try 


(  "8  ; 

try  fo  large  and  populous,  to  the  degree  we  have 
related.  The  Charge  of  the  War  in  the  lad  three 
Years  was  no  left  than  One  hundred  and  feventy 
thoufand  founds  \  befides  the  conftant  Charge  of 
watching,  \varding,  fcouting,  making  and  re- 
pairing of  Garrifons,  &amp;c.  which  may  modeftly 
be  computed  at  upwards  olfevmty  thoufand  founds 
more.  Yer  after  all,  the  Enemy  have  but  little 
caufe  of  Triumph  ;  for  that  one  third  of  them 
(at  leaft)  have  been  deftroy'd,  and  one  of  their 
Tribes  lb  (hattered  (at  Nandgvjalk)  that  they  are 
never  more  like  to  make  any  formidable  head. 

Now  as  Peace  feems  once  more  to  be  con- 
cluded by  the  Treaty  beforementioned^  the  great- 
eft  Difficulty  will  be  to  fupport  and  maintain  it. 
If  Trading  Houfes^  which  are  now  refolved  on, 
(by  the  Wifdom  of  the  Government)  be  well  re- 
gulated, it  may  (  under  God  j  be  a  means  of 
our  Tranquility :  Efpecially  if  the  Govern- 
ment can  alfo  prevail  with  them  to  receive  the 
Minifirj  for  their  inftrudlion  in  the  Principles  of 
the  true  Religion. 

But  altho'  it  was  agreed  on  with  the  feveral 
Delegates  that  the  Treaty  fhould  be  ratified  and 
confirmed  in  a  publick  and  folemn  manner  by 
the  Chiefs  of  the  feveral  Tribes  of  the  Eaftern  In- 
dians at  Falmouth  in  Cafco-Bayy  fome  time  in  the 
Month  of  May  ;  yet  when  that  time  came  they 
were  not  ready  for  it,  but  feem'd  for  fome  time 
uncertain  and  dilatory-  Neverthelefs  the  Govern- 
ment  from  time  to  time  received  Advices  of  their 
continued  defires  of  Peace ;  and  refolving  that 
the  failure  fliould  not  be  on  our  part,  His  Ho^

his  Honour  abfolutely  refufed,  requiring  him  to 
come  to  Cafco,  and  promifing  him  Jafe  condu^. 

On  the  29th  iVenemovet  arrived,  with  a  number 
of  his  Principal  Men  and  others,  about  forty ^  and 
on  the  thirtieth  the  Conference  for  the  Ratification 
of  the  late  Treaty  was  enter'd  on ;  and  on  the 
Jixth  of  Jugufi  it  was  concladed. 

The  ^enobfeot  Tribe  only  appeared,  but  in  be- 
half of  all  the  other  Tribes.  The  Canada  Tribe? 
had  been  fent  to  by  them,  and  had  fent  a  Letter 
C:as  they  faidj  with  two  Wjimjam  Belts  •  the  on^ 
for  their  Brethren  of  Fenohfcot,  in  Token  I  fup- 
pofeof  their  being  concluded  by  them  in  the 
prefent  Treaty,  the  other  to  be  prefented  to  our 
Gcvernour  upon  the  Ratification  of  the  Treaty ; 
which  was  accordingly  prefented. 

The  Lieut.  Governour  demanded  of  them,  Why 
the  Narridgv/alks  were  not  there  ?  IVenemovet  ^xi" 
fwered,  that  they  had  full  power  to  ael  for  them, 
and  for  the  Wowenocks  and  the  Arreruguntenocks, 
and  the  St.  Francois. 

The  Governments  bad  many  and  large  Confer  en" 

as  with  the  Indians ;  worthy  to  be  communicated 

to  the  Publick,  and   which  would  be  an  Enter-^ 

tainmene  to  the  Curious.    In  thefe  Conferences  the

Difcretion  and  Prudence  of  the  Salvages  was  ob* 
fervable,  as  well  as  the  Wifdom,  Jufticc,  Equity 
and  Tendernefs  of  the  Covemours  on  our  part. 

One  of  the  fiift  things  that  the  Indians  defircd 
of  our  Governours  was.  That  they  would  give  or- 
der that  the  Vejfels  in  the  Harbour  as  well  as  the 
Taverns  afhore  might  be  reftrained  from  felling 
any  Liquors  to  their  Young  Men.  The  Govet'-^ 
mut  told  them,  that  he  very  much  approved  of 
that,  and  would  give  order  accordingly. 

On  Saturday y  July  }oth  when  the  Conference 
for  the  day  was  over,  the  Lieut,  Governour  told 
them, "  To  Morrow  i$  the  Lords-Day,  on  which 
we  do  no  Bufmefs.  Loron,  their  Speaker,  an- 
fwsred  readily,  "  To  Morrow  is  our  Sakhatb-Day  j 
we  aifo  keep  the  Day. 

It  may  be  a  pleafure  to  the  Reader  to  have  the 
Words  of  the  Ratidcation  of  the  Treaty,  both  on 
€ur  part  and  alfo  on  the  part  of  the  Indians,

After  the  Ratification  was  over  the  Lieut-  Go' 
njernour  among  other  things,  defired  them  to  fay, 
what  Meafures  they  purpos'd  to  take,  whereby 
the  Inhabitants  on  our  Frontiers  may  be  made  ca- 
(ie  and  fafe,  notwithftanding  the  Narridgwalks  &amp;c. 
who  did  not  perfonaHy  appear  to  Ratify  the  Ar- 
ticles of  the  prefent  Treaty  ? 

They  anfwered,  That  they  would  have  the  In- 
habitants of  the  Frontiers  to  be  very  careful  ^  and 
that  as  foon  as  they  return'd  home  it  (hould  be 
their  firft  care  to  fend  to  ail  the  Tribes^  and  tec 
them  know  that  there  is  a  Peace  made.

The  Lieut.  Governour  ask'd  them.  Will  yoa  lay 
your  Commands  and  Injiin(5^ions  on  the  other 
Tribes  for  that  purpofe,  as  far  as  you  are  able  ? 
Loron  anfwered,  We  will  do  our  urmoft  to  ob- 
lige 'em  to  live  peaceably  towards  us. 

The  Lieut*  Governour  replied,  Do  you  fay  you 
will  refent  it,  if  any  hoftile  A6ls  or  Injuries  (hould 
be  committed  againft  our  People  ? 

Loron.  We  will  refent  fuch  AAions,  and  joyn 
our  young  Men  with  yours  in  fuch  a  cafe,  and 
oblige  them  to  be  quiet  and  fit  down-  We  mean 
in  cafe  any  of  the  Tribes  fhould  rife  againft  us,  or 
refift  us,  we  will  take  cflfeftual  means  to  fee  'em 
down  by  force.  As  to  the  firfi  Treaty  we  reckon- 
ed our  felves  obliged  to  this,  but  we  account  we 
are  under  much  more  and  ftronger  Obligations 
to  it  now ;  Hnce  the  Engagements  onr  whole 
Tribe  have  taken  upon  them,  in  ratifying  the  Ar- 
ticles of  the  Treaty,  We  (hall  take  effedual  care 
therefore  that  any  fuch  Perfons  be  obliged  to  fit 
down. 

We  have  given  our  Words,  and  repeated  our 
Promifes  and  Engagements ;  and  our  Words  are 
written  dowii,  and  they  will  appear  afterwards 
againft  us. 

When  the  whole  Conference  was  tranfcribed^ 
it  was  on  Augufl  i\.  (may  the  Day  be  memorable 
and  happy  to  us  and  ours  after  us)  diftindly  read 
over  and  interpreted  to  IVenemovet  and  the  Indi- 
ans with  him  ;  and  the  Ueut,  Governour  ask'd  them 
if  they  underftood  it,  and  whether  it  was  right- 
ly taken  down  ?  They  anfwered.  That  the  Con- 
ference was  rightly  taken  down,  aad  not  a  word 
miffing  in  it.

single  handed  and  alone  defended  his  settlement  during  the 
Indian  War  in  1675.  William  Tyng  commanded  as  Lieu- 
tenant the  forces  of  fortified  houses  in  Dunstable  in  1703,

vicinity,  and  came  towards  night  to  this  garrison;  appre- 
hending no  danger,  turned  their  horses  loose  upon  the  in- 
terval, piled  their  arms  and  harness  in  the  house,  and  began 
a  carousal,  to  exhilarate  their  spirits  after  the  fatigues  of 
the  day.  A  party  of  Indians  had  lately  arrived  in  the 
vicinity,  and  on  that  day  had  designed  to  attack  both 
Wells'  and  Galusha's  garrisons.  One  of  their  number  had 
been  stationed  to  watch  each  of  these  houses,  to  see  that 
no  assistance  approached,  and  no  alarm  was  given.  A 
short  time  previous  to  the  approach  of  the  cavalry,  the 
Indian  stationed  at  Wells'  had  retired  to  his  party,  and 
reported  that  all  was  safe.  At  sunset,  a  Mr.  Cumings  and 
his  wife  went  out  to  milk  their  cows,  and  left  the  gate  open. 
The  Indians,  who  had  advanced  undiscovered,  started  up.

shot  Mrs.  Cumings  dead  upon  the  spot,  and  wounded  her 
husband.  They  then  rushed  through  the  open  gate  into 
the  house,  with  all  the  horrid  yells  of  conquering  savages, 
but  stared  with  amazement  on  finding  the  room  filled  with 
soldiers  merrily  feasting.  Both  parties  were  completely 
amazed,  and  neither  acted  with  much  propriety.  The 
soldiers,  so  suddenly  interrupted  in  their  jovial  entertain- 
ment, found  themselves  called  to  fight,  when  entirely  desti- 
tute of  arms,  and  incapable  of  obtaining  them.  The  greater 
part  were  panic-struck,  and  unable  to  fight  or  fly.  Fortu- 
nately, all  were  not  in  this  sad  condition;  some  six  or  seven 
courageous  souls,  with  chairs,  clubs,  and  whatever  they 
could  seize  upon,  furiously  attacked  the  advancing  foe. 
The  Indians  who  were  as  much  surprised  as  the  soldiers, 
had  but  little  more  courage  than  they,  and  immediately 
took  to  their  heels  for  safety;  thus  yielding  the  house,  de- 
feated by  one  quarter  their  number  of  unarmed  men.  The 
trumpeter,  who  was  in  the  upper  part  of  the  house  at  the 
commencement  of  the  attack,  seized  his  trumpet  and  began 
sounding  an  alarm,  when  he  was  shot  dead  by  an  Indian 
on  the  stair- way.     He  was  the  only  one  of  the  party  killed. 

The  savages  disappointed  in  this  part  of  their  plan, 
immediately  proceeded  to  Galusha's,  two  miles  distant; 
took  possession  of,  and  burnt  it.  One  woman  only  escaped. 
Had  the  company  at  Wells'  armed  and  immediately  pur- 
sued, they  might  probably  have  prevented  this  disaster; 
but  they  spent  so  much  time  in  arming  and  getting  their 
horses  that  the  enemy  had  an  opportunity  to  perpetrate 
the  mischief  and  escape  uninjured. 

The  woman  above  mentioned,  when  the  Indians  attacked 
the  house,  sought  refuge  in  the  cellar,  and  concealed  herself 
under  a  dry  cask.  After  hastily  plundering  the  house, 
and  murdering,  as  they  supposed,  all  who  were  in  it,  the 
Indians  set  it  on  fire  and  immediately  retired.  The  woman 
in  this  critical  situation,  attempted  to  escape  by  the  window, 
but  found  it  too  small;  she  however,  succeeded  in  loosening 
the  stones  till  she  had  opened  a  hole  sufficient  to  admit  of 
her  passage,  and  vAth  the  house  in  flames  over  her  head, 
she  forced  herself  out,  and  crawled  into  the  bushes,  not 
daring  to  rise  for  fear  she  would  be  discovered.     In  the

bushes  she  lay  concealed  until  the  next  day,   when  she 
reached  one  of  the  neighboring  garrisons. 

Cumings,  at  Wells'  garrison,  had  his  arm  broken,  but 
was  so  fortunate  as  to  reach  the  woods  while  the  Indians 
were  engaged  in  the  house.  That  night  he  lay  in  a  swamp 
in  the  northerly  part  of  what  at  present  constitutes  the 
town  of  Tyngsborough,  about  one  quarter  of  a  mile  west 
of  the  great  road  as  it  now  runs,  and  a  few  rods  south  of 
the  state  line.  The  next  day  he  arrived  at  the  garrison

In  a  preceding  war  with  the  Indians,  he  had  been  taken  a 
prisoner  from  the  vicinity  of  Dunstable  and  carried  to 
Canada,  from  whence  by  his  shrewdness  and  sagacity,  he 
effected  his  escape,  with  one  English  captive,  and  returned 
to  his  friends  in  Dunstable.  The  Indians  had  for  a  long 
time  endeavored  to  retake  him,  and  he  was  peculiarly  ob- 
noxious to  them;  and  at  the  time  above  m.entioned,  while 
he  was  accompanying  Capt.  Butterfield  and  his  wife  on  a

gested as  he  states,  the  lines  that  follow  on  page  54,  the 
coincidence  is  remarkable.  One  would  rather  assume  that 
he  had  been  refreshing  his  memory  of  the  events  of  Sir 
WilHam  Phips'  career  by  reading  a  stray  copy  of  Cotton 
Mather's  Magnolia  Christi  Americana  which  he  may  have 
had  in  his  library.  In  this  now  rare  volume,  he  would  have 
found,  in  the  story  of  Phips'  attack  on  Quebec,  in  1690,  the 
very  same  lines  suggesting  themselves  to  the  learned  Dr. 
Mather,  and  introduced  with  a  similar  phrase — "as  the  poet 
expresseth  it."  But  we  find  the  rhyme  on  p.  54  wanting  in 
the  manuscript,  so  the  whole  thing  is  undoubtedly  one  of

had  been  Colonel  of  the  regiment  of  Coriagon,  in  France. 
He  was  a  man  of  family  and  fortune:  he  came  to  America 
in  1670,  and  settled  among  the  Penobscot  Indians,  married 
a  daughter  of  the  Chief,  and  had  several  other  wives.  By 
the  treaty  of  Breda,  the  territory  beyond  the  Penobscot 
was  ceded  to  France,  and  Castine  lived  within  that  country. 
Some  difficulty  arose  about  a  cargo  of  wine,  which  was 
landed  in  the  countr&gt;%  and  a  new  Hne  was  run  by  the  Eng- 
lish, by  which  the  place  of  landing,  together  with  Castine's 
lands,  was  taken  within  the  English  Claim.  Andross,  in  his 
expedition  before  named,  plundered  Castine's  house  of 
everything  valuable,  in  his  absence.  This  base  act  so 
exasperated  him,  that  he  used  his  exertions  to  inflame  the 
Indians  against  the  English,  which  he  effectually  did,  and 
their  chief  supplies  of  arms  and  ammunition  were  furnished 
by  him.  He  had  an  estate  in  France,  to  which  he  retired 
when  the  French  lost  their  possessions  in  that  part  of  the 
country.  See  Sullivan's  Hist,  of  Maine,  pp.  93,  158,  226.

Line  19.— About  the  year  1720,  Capt.  Thomas  Baker  of 
Northampton,  in  the  county  of  Hampshire,  in  Massachu- 
setts, sat  off  with  a  scouting  party  of  thirty-four  men,  passed 
up  Connecticut  river,  and  crossed  the  height  of  land  to 
Pemigewasset  river.  He  there  discovered  a  party  of 
Indians,  whose  Sachem  was  called  Walternummus,  whom 
he  attacked  and  destroyed.  Baker  and  the  Sachem  levelled 
and  discharged  their  guns  at  each  other  at  the  same  instant. 
The  ball  from  the  Indian's  gun  grazed  Baker's  left  eyebrow,

but  did  him  no  injury.  The  ball  from  Baker's  gun  went 
through  the  breast  of  the  Sachem.  Immediately  upon  being 
wounded,  he  leaped  four  or  five  feet  high,  and  then  fell 
instantly  dead.  The  Indians  fled  to  the  river;  Baker  and 
his  party  pursued,  and  destroyed  every  one  of  them.  They 
had  a  wigwam  on  the  bank  of  the  river,  which  was  nearly 
filled  with  beaver.  Baker's  party  took  as  much  of  it  as 
they  could  carry  away,  and  burned  the  rest.  Baker  lost 
none  of  his  men  in  this  skirmish.  It  took  place  at  the  con- 
fluence of  a  small  river  with  the  Pemigewasset,  between 
Plymouth  and  Campton,  which  has  since  had  the  name  of 
Baker's  river.  Farmer's  &amp;  Moore's  Collections,  III,  p.  100.

The  day  of  his  installation  was  deferred  on  account  of  the 
discouragements  of  the  times,  till  the  fall  of  1723,  when  he 
was  cut  off  by  the  enemy.  The  following  account  of  his 
death,  and  other  Indian  depredations,  is  given  by  Mr. 
Whitne5%  in  his  History  of  Worcester  county. 

As  Deacon  Joseph  Stevens  and  four  of  his  sons  were  m.ak- 
ing  hay  in  a  meadow,  at  Rutland,  on  the  14th  August,  1723, 
they  were  surprised  by  five  Indians.  The  father  escaped  in 
the  bushes;  two  of  the  sons  were  slain,  and  two,  Phineas  and 
Isaac,  were  made  prisoners.  Two  of  the  five  Indians  way- 
laid a  Mr.  Davis  and  son,  who  that  afternoon  were  making 
hay  in  a  meadow  not  far  off,  but  weary  of  waiting,  they  were 
returning  to  the  others,  and  met  Mr.  Willard  in  their  way, 
who  w^as  armed.  One  of  the  Indian's  guns  missed  fire,  the 
others  did  no  execution.  Mr.  Willard  returned  the  fire  and 
wounded  one  of  them,  it  is  said  mortally;  the  other  closed 
in  with  Mr.  Willard;  but  he  would  have  been  more  than  a 
match  for  him,  had  not  the  other  three  come  to  his  assis-

-Mr.  Willard.  Phineas  Stevens,  above  mentioned,  was  the

age,  after  a  painful  mission  of  37  years;  26  of  which  were 
spent  at  Norridgwock.  Previous  to  his  residence  at  this 
place,  he  spent  six  years  in  traveling  among  the  Indian 
nations  in  the  interior  parts  of  America;  and  in  learning 
most  of  their  languages.  "II  Scavoit  presque  toute  les

man  of  good  sense,  learning  and  address;  and  by  a  gentle, 
condescending  deportment,  and  a  compliance  T;vith  the 
Indian  mode  of  life,  he  obtained  an  entire  ascendency  over 
the  natives,  and  used  his  influence  to  promote  the  interests 
of  the  French  among  them.  "He  even  made  the  offices  of 
devotion  serv^e  as  incentives  to  their  ferocity;  and  kept  a

arrows,  which  he  used  to  hoist  on  a  pole  at  the  door  of  his 
church,  when  he  gave  them  absolution,  previously  to  their 
engaging  in  any  warlike  enterprise."  A  dictionary  of  the

The  persons  taken  were  Nathan  Cross  and  Thomas  Blan- 
chard,  who  had  been  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of  tur- 
pentine, on  the  north  side  of  Nashua  River,  near  where 
Nashua  village  now  stands.  At  that  time,  there  were  no 
houses  or  settlements  on  that  side  of  the  river.  These  men 
had  been  in  the  habit  of  returning  every  night  to  lodge  in  a 


NOTES.  33 

saw-mill  on  the  other  side.  That  night  they  came  not  as  usu- 
al. An  alarmVas  given;  it  was  feared  they  had  fallen  into  the 
hands  of  the  Indians.  A  party  consisting  of  ten  of  the 
principal  inhabitants  of  the  place  started  in  search  of  them, 
under  the  direction  of  one  French,  a  sergeant  of  militia.  In 
this  company  was  Farwell,  who  was  afterwards  lieutenant 
under  Lovewell.  When  this  party  arrived  at  the  spot  where 
the  men  had  been  laboring,  they  found  the  hoops  of  the 
barrel  cut,  and  the  turpentine  spread  upon  the  ground. 
From  certain  marks  upon  the  trees  made  with  coal  mixed 
with  grease,  they  understood  that  the  men  were  taken  and 
carried  off  alive.  In  the  course  of  the  examination,  Farwell 
perceived  that  the  turpentine  had  not  ceased  spreading, 
and  called  the  attention  of  his  comrads  to  this  circumstance. 
They  concluded  that  the  Indians  had  been  gone  but  a  short 
time,  and  must  still  be  near,  and  decided  upon  an  instant 
pursuit.  Farwell  advised  them  to  take  a  circuitous  rout, 
to  avoid  an  ambush.  But  unfortunately  he  and  French 
had  a  short  time  previous  had  a  misunderstanding  and  were 
then  at  variance.  French  imputed  this  advice  to  cowardice, 
and  called  out,  "I  am  going  to  take  the  direct  path;  if  any 
of  you  are  not  afraid,  let  him  follow  me."  French  led  the 
way  and  the  whole  party  followed,  Farwell  falling  in  the 
rear.  Their  route  was  up  the  Merrimack,  towards  they 
bent  their  course  to  look  for  their  horses  upon  the  interval. 
At  the  brook  near  Lutwyche's  (now  Thornton's)  ferry,  they 
were  way-laid.  The  Indians  fired  upon  them,  and  killed 
the  larger  part  instantly.  A  few  fled,  but  were  overtaken 
and  destroyed.  French  was  killed  about  a  mile  from  the 
place  of  action,  under  an  oak  tree  now  standing  in  a  field 
belonging  to  Mr.  Lund  in  Merrimack.  Farwell  in  the  rear 
seeing  those  before  him  fall,  sprung  behind  a  tree,  discharged 
his  piece  and  ran.  Two  Indians  pursued  him:  the  chase 
was  vigorously  maintained  for  some  time  without  gaining 
much  advantage,  till  Farwell  passing  through  a  thicket,  the 
Indians  lost  sight  of  him,  and  fearing  he  might  have  loaded 
again,  they  desisted.  He  was  the  only  one  of  the  company 
that  escaped.  A  company  from  the  neighborhood  mustered 
upon  the  news  of  this  disaster,  proceeded  to  the  fatal  spot, 
took  up  the  bodies  of  their  friends  and  townsmen  and  inter-

of  20  Pounds  in  Province  bills.  .  .  with  him  (illeg.).  Capt.

well,  of  Dunstable.  His  father  died  about  1755,  aged  about 
95.  His  grandfather  was  John  Lowell  spelled  also  Lowel, 
Lowwell,  Lovill  or  Lovwell, — a  Boston  tanner  before  1665, 
who  removed  to  Dunstable  about  1683.  Mr.  Ezra  S. 
Stearns,  in  his  Early  Generations  of  the  Founders  of  Old  Dun-

Line  1. — This  Indian  has  been  celebrated  as  a  hero,  and 
ranked  with  the  Roman  Curtius,  who  devoted  himself  to 
death  to  save  his  country.  (See  Hutchinson's  History,  II, 
p.  315.)  Having  been  on  the  spot  where  this  celebrated 
action  happened,  and  having  conversed  with  persons  who 
were  acquainted  with  the  Indians  of  Pigwacket,  before  and 
after  this  battle,  I  am  convinced  that  there  is  no  foundation 
for  the  idea  that  he  was  placed  there  to  decoy;  and  that  he 
had  no  claim  to  the  character  of  a  hero.  The  point  on  which 
he  stood  is  a  noted  fishing  place;  the  gun  which  alarmed 
Lovewell's  company,  was  fired  at  a  flock  of  ducks ;  and  when 
they  met  him,  he  was  returning  home  with  his  game  and 
two  fowling  pieces.  The  village  was  situated  at  the  edge  of 
the  Saco  river,  which  here  forms  a  large  bend.  The  remains 
of  the  stockades  were  found  by  the  first  settlers,  forty 
years  afterward.  The  pond  is  in  the  township  of 
Frieburg. — Belknap's  Hist,  of  N.  Hampshire,  pp.  65-66.

yardes,"  they  fired  on  both  sides.  "The  Indians  fell  in 
considerable  numbers,  but  the  EngUsh,  most,  if  not  all  of 
them,  escaped  the  first  shot." — Drake's  Appendix  to  Indian 
Wars,  p.  332.  fC.].  Line  13. — Hoping  to  be  sheltered  by 
a  point  of  rocks  which  ran  into  the  pond,  and  a  few  large 
pine  trees  standing  on  a  sandy  beach,  in  this  forlorn  place 
they  took  their  station.  On  their  right  was  the  mouth  of  a 
brook,  at  that  time  unfordable;  on  their  left,  was  the  rocky 
point;  their  front  was  partly  covered  by  a  deep  bog,  and 
partly  uncovered;  and  the  pond  was  in  their  rear.  The 
enemy  galled  them  in  front  and  flank,  and  had  them  so 
completely  in  their  power,  that  had  they  made  a  prudent

use  of  their  advantage,  the  whole  company  must  either  have

be  saved  by  timely  warning  or  to  be  secured  for  reinforce- 
ment. The  strange  penalty  of  namelessness  was  imposed 
upon  this  man  by  the  Rev.  Thomas  Symmes  in  his  Sermon 
— the  first  printed  account  of  the  engagement.  Genealogi- 
cal resiarch,  nearly  two  centuries  later,  supplies  the  probable 
explanation  of  the  reason  why  he  was  not  publicly  branded 
by  name,  the  least  that  a  deserter,  if  such  he  was,  might 
expect.  The  facts  are  that  he  was  a  cousin  of  Lovewell — 
the  son  of  Joseph  who  was  a  brother  of  Anna,  Capt,  John 
Lovewell's  mother,  His  name  was  Benjamin  Hassell. 
He  was  born  August  9,  1701,  at  Dunstable.  It  seems  that 
anonymity  was  the  worst  punishment  that  Symmes  be- 
lieved he  could  inflict  upon  so  near  a  relative  of  the  hero 
Lovewell  without  detracting  from  the  glory  of  the  family 
name,  See  Stearns,  Early  Generations  of  the  Founders  of  Old

titled Lovewell  Lamented,  etc.,  long  celebrated  as  the  most 
valuable  book  of  its  size  in  the  list  of  Americana.  Rev. 
Thomas  Symmes,  of  Bradford,  Mass.,  whose  Memoir  of 
Lovewell's  Fight  is  published  entire  in  the  first  volume  of

Line  4. — This  paragraph  is  not  in  the  manuscript.  Un- 
questionably it  is  the  intercalation  of  the  Reverend  Ben- 
jamin Colman.  Line  9. — "So  soon  as  the  report  came  of 
Capt.  Lovewell's  disaster,  fifty  men  from  New  Hampshire, 
well  armed,  and  with  twelve  days'  subsistence,  marched 
thither  to  bury  the  dead  and  draw  off  the  wounded,  but 
were  so  miserably  terrify'd  that  in  a  most  shamefull  and 
cowardly  manner  they  returned  without  searching  for 
the  wounded  or  dead,  or  making  the  least  discovery." 
[MS].  Line  10. — This  account  of  Lovewell's  battle  is 
collected  from  the  authorities  cited  in  the  margin,  and  from 
the  verbal  information  of  aged  and  intelligent  persons. 
The  names  of  the  dead,  on  the  trees,  and  the  holes  where 
balls  had  entered  and  been  cut  out,  were  plainly  visible, 
when  I  was  on  the  spot  in  1784.  The  trees  had  the  appear- 
ance of  being  very  old,  and  one  of  them  was  fallen. — Bel- 
knap's Hist,  of  N.  Hampshire,  II,  p.  70.  [C.].  Line  13. — 
"Col.  Tyng  from  Dunstable  with  Capt.  White  now  went  to 
bury  the  dead,  and  make  what  discovery  they  could  who 
.  .  .  [torn]  where  the  fight  was,  buryed  12  of  our  men,  and  at 
a  little  distance  found  3  Indians,  lightly  covded  over  whom 
they  scalpt  in  expectation  of  some  reward  from  the  Govern- 
ment." [MS.].  Line  16.— Many  of  Lovewell's  men  knew 
Paugus  personally.  A  huge  bear's  skin  formed  part  of  his 
dress.     From  Mr.  Symmes'  account,  it  appears  that  John

Chamberlain  killed  him.  They  had  spoken  together  some 
time  in  the  fight,  and  afterwards  both  happened  to  go  to  the 
pond  to  wash  out  their  guns,  which  were  rendered  useless  by 
so  frequent  firing.  Here  the  challenge  was  given  by  Paugus, 
"It  is  you  or  I,"  As  soon  as  the  guns  were  prepared,  they 
fired,  and  Paugus  fell. — Drake's  Avipendix  to  Indian  Wars, 
p.  234.  [C.].  Line  27. — This  paragraph  not  in  the  manu- 
script, but  after  a  reference  to  1st  Samuel,  28:10,  there 
follow  some  reflections  on  the  notorious  fact  "that  Evill 
spts.  in  ye  Oracles  of  the  Heathen  have  often  foretold 
future  contingencies;  which  is  a  mystery  of  providence  in 
permitting  ym  to  bee  instruments  of  such  revelations,  and 
is  very  often  for  ye  tryall  of  some,  and  the  terrour  of  others. 
But  the  Devill  by  his  wonderfull  sagacity  judgmt.  and 
foresight,  who  is  transendently  superior  unto  any  mortall 
might  in  an  extraordinary  manr.  conjecture  this,  by  the 
number  of  one  and  the  other,  together  with  the  advantages 
that  probably  would  happen,  and  by  other  symptoms  be- 
yond the  reach  of ...  .  [illeg.]  to  penetrate  into."

Line  3. — This  was  one  of  the  most  fierce  and  obstinate 
battles  which  had  been  fought  with  the  Indians.  Then 
had  not  only  the  advantage  of  numbers,  but  of  placing 
themselves  in  ambush,  and  waiting  with  deliberation  the 
moment  of  attack.  These  circumstances  gave  them  a  de- 
gree of  ardor  and  impetuosity.  Lovewell  and  his  men, 
though  disappointed  of  meeting  the  enemy  in  their  front, 
expected  and  determined  to  fight.  The  fall  of  their  com- 
mander and  more  than  one  quarter  of  their  number,  in  the 
first  onset,  was  greatly  discouraging;  but  they  knew  the 
situation  to  which  they  were  reduced,  and  their  distance 
from  the  frontiers,  cut  off  all  hope  of  safety  by  flight.  In 
these  circumstances,  prudence  as  well  as  valor,  dictated  a 
continuance  of  the  engagement,  and  a  refusal  to  surrender; 
until  the  enemy,  awed  by  their  brave  resistance,  and  weak- 
ened by  their  own  loss,  yielded  them  the  honor  of  the  field. 
After  this  encounter,  the  Indians  resided  no  more  at  Pig- 
wacket,  till  the  peace.— Belknap,  II,  p.  69,  70.     [N.  H.]. 

With  all  men  of  his  time  on  the  exposed  frontiers  of  New 
England,  Lovewell  must  have  had  an  inborn  hatred  of    the

Indian.  As  a  youth  he  had  lost  many  neighbors  by  the 
Indians  and  within  a  period  of  a  single  month,  he  had  lost 
by  the  same  enemy,  a  grandfather,  a  grandmother,  an  uncle 
and  two  other  relatives.  But  this  expedition  of  his  volun- 
teer company  to  Pigwacket  was  undoubtedly  undertaken 
chiefly  for  profit,  pure  and  simple.  Several  others  were 
out  hunting  for  scalps  for  each  of  which  the  General  Court 
of  Massachusetts  had  offered  100  Pounds  currency.  The 
expedition  was,  in  short,  a  prosaic  "big  game"  hunting 
trip,  with  the  added  zest  of  prospective  commercial  gain, 
much  as  the  modern  sportsman  seeks  excitement  and  ivory 
in  Africa  today.  Insular  tradition  has  praised  these  pot- 
hunters into  heroic  proportions.  The  roll  of  the  47  men, 
mcluding  officers,  in  this  so-called  Third  company  may  be

Line  2. — The  Indians  had  come  down  to  Cochecho,  with 
a  design  to  take  the  family  of  Hanson  again.  When  they 
had  come  near  the  house,  they  observed  some  people  at 
work  in  a  neighboring  field,  by  which  it  was  necessary  for 
them  to  pass,  both  in  going  and  returning.  This  obliged  them 
to  alter  their  purpose,  and  conceal  themselves  in  a  barn, 
till  they  were  ready  to  attack  them.  Two  women  passed 
by  the  barn  while  they  were  in  it,  and  had  just  reached  the 
garrison   as   the  guns   were   fired.     They   shot   Benjamin

Evans  dead  on  the  spot;  wounded  William  Evans  and  cut 
his  throat.  John  Evans  received  a  slight  wound  in  the 
breast,  which  bleeding  plentifully,  deceived  them,  and  think- 
ing him  dead,  they  stripped  and  scalped  him.  He  bore  the 
painful  operation  v/ithout  discovering  any  signs  of  life, 
though  all  the  time  in  his  perfect  senses,  and  continued  in 
the  feigned  appearance  of  death,  till  they  had  turned  him 
over,  and  struck  him  several  blows  with  their  guns,  and 
left  him  for  dead.  After  they  were  gone  off,  he  rose  and 
walked,  naked  and  bloody,  towards  the  garrison;  but  on 
meeting  his  friends  by  the  way,  dropped,  fainting  on  the 
ground,  and  being  covered  with  a  blanket,  was  conveyed  to 
the  house.  He  recovered  and  lived  fifty  years.  A  pur- 
suit was  made  after  the  enemy,  but  they  got  off  undiscovered 
carrying  ^dth  them  Benjamin  Evans,  Jr.  a  lad  of  13,  to 
Canada,  whence  he  was  afterwards  redeemed. — Belknap, 
11,80.  [N.H.I.  See  Goodrich,  p.  490.  Line  31.— August 
25,  1725,  deacon  Field,  deacon  Childs,  and  others,  were 
going  up  to  the  Green  river  farms,  and  were  ambushed  by 
the  Indians,  but  they  discovered  the  Indians,  and  John 
Wells  discharged  his  gun  at  an  Indian,  who  fell;  the  Indians 
fired  at  them,  and  wounded  deacon  Samuel  Field,  the  ball 
passing  through  the  right  hypocondria,  cutting  off  three 
plaits  of  the  m.ysenteria,  vrhich  hung  out  of  the  wound,  in 
length  almost  two  inches,  which  was  cat  off  even  with  the 
body,  the  bullet  passing  between  the  lowest  and  the  next 
rib,  cutting,  at  its  going  forth,  the  lowest  rib;  his  hand  being 
close  to  the  body  when  the  ball  came  forth,  it  entered  at 
the  root  of  the  heel  of  the  thumb,  cutting  the  bone  of  the 
fore  finger,  and,  resting  betv/een  the  fore  and  second  finger, 
was  cut  out,  and  all  the  wounds  were  cured  in  less  than  five 
weeks,  by  doctor  Thomas  Hastings. — App.  to  Williams'
