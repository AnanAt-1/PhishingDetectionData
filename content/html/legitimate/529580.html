found in reason itself a step towards faith.  "Reason would never give in<br>
if she were not of opinion that there are occasions when she ought to<br>
give in."<br>
<br>
By his philosophical method, powerful and logical, as well as by the<br>
clear, strong, and concise style he made use of to expound it, Descartes<br>
accomplished the transition from the sixteenth century to the seventeeth;<br>
he was the first of the great prose-writers of that incomparable epoch,<br>
which laid forever the foundations of the language.  At the same moment<br>
the great Corneille was rendering poetry the same service.<br>
<br>
It had come out of the sixteenth century more disturbed and less formed<br>
than prose; Ronsard and his friends had received it from the hands of<br>
Marot, quite young, unsophisticated and undecided; they attempted, at the<br>
first effort, to raise it to the level of the great classic models of<br>
which their minds were full.  The attempt was bold, and the Pleiad did<br>
not pretend to consult the taste of the vulgar.  "The obscurity of<br>
Ronsard," says M. Guizot, in his _Corneille et son Temps,_ "is not that<br>
of a subtle mind torturing itself to make something out of nothing; it is<br>
the obscurity of a full and a powerful mind, which is embarrassed by its<br>
own riches, and has not learned to regulate the use of them.  Furnished,<br>
by his reading of the ancients, with that which was wanting in our<br>
poetry, Ronsard thought he could perceive in his lofty and really<br>
poetical imagination what was needed to supply it; he cast his eyes in<br>
all directions, with the view of enriching the domain of poetry.<br>
'Thou wilt do well to pick dexterously,' he says, in his abridgment of<br>
the art of French poetry, 'and adopt to thy work the most expressive<br>
words in the dialects of our own France; there is no need to care whether<br>
the vocables are Gascon, or Poitevin, or Norman, or Mancese, or Lyonnese,<br>
or of other districts, provided that they are good, and properly express<br>
what thou wouldst say.'  Ronsard was too bold in extending his conquests<br>
over the classical languages; it was that exuberance of ideas, that<br>
effervescence of a genius not sufficiently master over its conceptions,<br>
which brought down upon him, in after times, the contempt of the writers<br>
who, in the seventeenth century, followed, with more wisdom and taste,<br>
the road which he had contributed to open.  'He is not,' said Balzac,<br>
'quite a poet; he has the first beginnings and the making of a poet; we<br>
see in his works nascent and half-animated portions of a body which is in<br>
formation, but which does not care to arrive at completion.' "<br>
<br>
This body is that of French poetry; Ronsard traced out its first<br>
lineaments, full of elevation, play of fancy, images, and a poetic fire<br>
unknown before him.  He was the first to comprehend the dignity which<br>
befits grand subjects, and which earned him in his day the title of<br>
Prince of poets.  He lived in stormy times, not much adapted for poetry,<br>
and steeped in the most cruel tragedies; he felt deeply the misfortunes<br>
of his country rent by civil war, when he wrote,--<br>
<br>
          "A cry of dread, a din, a thundering sound<br>
          Of men and clashing harness roars around;<br>
          Peoples 'gainst peoples furiously rage;<br>
          Cities with cities deadly battle wage;<br>
          Temples and towns--one heap of ashes lie;<br>
          Justice and equity fade out and die<br>
          Unchecked the soldier's wicked will is done<br>
          With human blood the outraged churches run;<br>
          Bedridden Age, disbedded, perisheth,<br>
          And over all grins the pale face of Death."<br>
<br>
There was something pregnant, noble, and brilliant about Ronsard, in<br>
spite of his exaggerations of style and faults of taste; his friends and<br>
disciples imitated and carried to an extreme his defects, without<br>
possessing his talent; the unruliness was such as to call for reform.<br>
Peace revived with Henry IV., and the court, henceforth in accord with<br>
the nation, resumed that empire over taste, manners, and ideas, which it<br>
was destined to exercise so long and so supremely under Louis XIV.<br>
Malherbe became the poet of the court, whose business it was to please<br>
it, to adopt for it that literature which had but lately been reserved<br>
for the feasts of the learned.  "He used often to say, and chiefly when<br>
he was reproached with not following the meaning of the authors he<br>
translated or paraphrased, that he did not dress his meat for cooks, as<br>
if he had meant to infer that he cared very little to be praised by the<br>
literary folks who understood the books he had translated, provided that<br>
he was understood by the court-folks."  A complete revolution in the<br>
opposite direction to that which Ronsard attempted appeared to have taken<br>
place, but the human mind never loses all the ground it has once won; in<br>
the verses of Malherbe, often bearing the imprint of beauties borrowed<br>
from the ancients, the language preserved, in consequence of the<br>
character given to it by Ronsard, a dignity, a richness of style, of<br>
which the times of Marot showed no conception; and it was falling,<br>
moreover, under the chastening influence of an elegant correctness.  It<br>
was for the court that Malherbe made verses,"striving, as he said, to<br>
degasconnize it," seeking there his public and the source of honor as<br>
well as profit.  As passionate an admirer of Richelieu as of Henry IV.,<br>
naturally devoted to the service of the order established in the state as<br>
well as in poetry, he, under the regency of Mary de' Medici, favored the<br>
taste which was beginning to show itself for intellectual things, for<br>
refined pleasures, and elegant occupations.  It was not around the queen<br>
that this honorable and agreeable society gathered; it was at the Hotel<br>
Rambouillet, around Catherine de Vivonne, in Rue St. Thomas du Louvre.<br>
Literature was there represented by Malherbe and Racan, afterwards by<br>
Balzac and Voiture, Gombault and Chapelain, who constantly met there, in<br>
company with Princess de Conde and her daughter, subsequently Duchess de<br>
Longueville, Mademoiselle du Vigean, Madame and Mdlle. d'Epernon, and the<br>
Bishop of Lucon himself, quite young as yet, but already famous.  "All<br>
the wits were received at the Hotel Rambouillet, whatever their<br>
condition," says M. Cousin: "all that was asked of them was to have good<br>
manners; but the aristocratic tone was established there without any<br>
effort, the majority of the guests at the house being very great lords,<br>
and the mistress being at one and the same time Rambouillet and Vivonne.<br>
The wits were courted and honored, but they did not hold the dominion."<br>
At that great period which witnessed the growth of Richelieu's power, and<br>
of the action he universally exercised upon French society, at the<br>
outcome from the moral licentiousness which Henry IV.'s example had<br>
encouraged in his court, and after a certain roughness, the fruit of long<br>
civil wars, a lesson was taught at Madame de Rambouillet's of modesty,<br>
grace, and lofty politeness, together with the art of forming good ideas<br>
and giving them good expression, sometimes with rather too much of<br>
far-fetched and affected cleverness, always in good company, and with<br>
much sweetness and self-possession on the part of the mistress of the<br>
house.  In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, having become minister, sent the<br>
Marquis of Rambouillet as ambassador to Spain.  He wanted to be repaid<br>
for this favor.  One of his friends went to call upon Madame de<br>
Rambouillet.  At the first hint of what was expected from her, "I do not<br>
believe that there are any intrigues between Cardinal Valette and the<br>
princess," said she, "and, even if there were, I should not be the proper<br>
person for the office it is intended to put upon me.  Besides, everybody<br>
is so convinced of the consideration and friendship I have for his<br>
Eminence that nobody would dare to speak ill of him in my presence; I<br>
cannot, therefore, ever have an opportunity of rendering him the services<br>
you ask of me."<br>
<br>
The cardinal did not persist, and remained well disposed towards Hotel<br>
Rambouillet.  Completely occupied in laying solidly the foundations of<br>
his power, in checkmating and punishing conspiracies at court, and in<br>
breaking down the party of the Huguenots, he had no leisure just yet to<br>
think of literature and the literary.  He had, nevertheless, in 1626,<br>
begun removing the ruins of the Sorbonne, with a view of reconstructing<br>
the buildings on a new plan and at his own expense.  He wrote, in 1627,<br>
to M. Saintot, "I thank him for the care he has taken of the Sorbonne,<br>
begging him to continue it, assuring him that, though I have many<br>
expenses on my hands, I am as desirous of continuing to build up that<br>
house as of contributing, to the best of my little ability, to pull down<br>
the fortifications of La Rochelle."  The works were not completely<br>
finished at the death of the cardinal, who provided therefor by his will.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: The King's Press----323]<br>
<br>
At the same time that he was repairing and enriching the Sorbonne, the<br>
cardinal was helping Guy de la Brosse, the king's physician, to create<br>
the Botanic Gardens (_Le Jardin des Plantes_), he was defending the<br>
independence of the College of France against the pretensions of the<br>
University of Paris, and gave it for its Grand Almoner his brother, the<br>
Archbishop of Lyons.  He was preparing the foundation of the King's Press<br>
(_Imprimerie royale_), definitively created in 1640; and he gave the<br>
Academy or King's College (college royal) of his town of Richelieu a<br>
regulation-code of studies which bears the imprint of his lofty and<br>
strong mind.  He prescribed a deep study of the French tongue.  "It often<br>
happens, unfortunately, that the difficulties which must be surmounted<br>
and the long time which is employed in learning the dead languages,<br>
before any knowledge of the sciences can be arrived at, have the effect,<br>
at the outset, of making young gentlemen disgusted and hasten to betake<br>
themselves to the exercise of arms without having been sufficiently<br>
instructed in good literature, though it is the fairest ornament of their<br>
profession.  .  .  .  It has, therefore, been thought necessary to<br>
establish a royal academy at which discipline suitable to their condition<br>
may be taught them in the French tongue, in order that they may exercise<br>
themselves therein, and that even foreigners, who are curious about it,<br>
may learn to know its riches and the graces it hath in unfolding the<br>
secrets of the highest discipline."  Herein is revealed the founder of<br>
the French Academy, skilful as he was in divining the wants of his day,<br>
and always ready to profit by new means of action, and to make them his<br>
own whilst doing them service.<br>
<br>
Associations of the literary were not unknown in France; Ronsard and his<br>
friends, at first under the name of the brigade and then under that of<br>
the Pleiad, often met to read together their joint productions, and to<br>
discuss literary questions; and the same thing was done, subsequently, in<br>
Malherbe's rooms.<br>
<br>
"Now let us speak at our ease," Balzac would say, when the sitting was<br>
over, "and without fear of committing solecisms."<br>
<br>
When Malherbe was dead and Balzac had retired to his country house on the<br>
borders of the Charente, some friends, "men of letters and of merits very<br>
much above the average," says Pellisson in his _Histoire de l'Academie<br>
Francaise,_ "finding that nothing was more inconvenient in this great<br>
city than to go often and often to call upon one another without finding<br>
anybody at home, resolved to meet one day in the week at the house of one<br>
of them.  They used to assemble at M. Conrart's, who happened to be most<br>
conveniently quartered for receiving them, and in the very heart of the<br>
city (Rue St. Martin).  There they conversed familiarly as they would<br>
have on an ordinary visit, and upon all sorts of things, business, news,<br>
and literature.  If any one of the company had a work done, as, often<br>
happened, he readily communicated its contents to all the others, who<br>
freely gave him their opinion of it, and their conferences were followed<br>
sometimes by a walk and sometimes by a collation which they took<br>
together.  Thus they continued for three or four years, as I have heard<br>
many amongst them say; it was an extreme pleasure and an incredible gain,<br>
insomuch that, when they speak nowadays of that time and of those early<br>
days of the Academy, they speak of it as a golden age during the which,<br>
without bustle and without show, and without any other laws but those of<br>
friendship, they enjoyed all that is sweetest and most charming in the<br>
intercourse of intellects and in rational life."<br>
<br>
Even after the intervention and regulationizing of Cardinal Richelieu,<br>
the French Academy still preserved something of that sweetness and that<br>
polished familiarity in their relations which caused the regrets of its<br>
earliest founders.  [They were MM. Godeau, afterwards Bishop of Grasse,<br>
Conrart and Gombault who were Huguenots, Chapelain, Giry, Habert, Abbe de<br>
Cerisy, his brother, M. de Serizay and M. de Maleville.] The secret of<br>
the little gatherings was not so well kept but that Bois-Robert, the<br>
cardinal's accredited gossip, ever on the alert for news to divert his<br>
patron, heard of them and begged before long to be present at them.<br>
"There was no probability of his being refused, for, besides that he was<br>
on friendly terms with many of these gentlemen, the very favor he enjoyed<br>
gave him some sort of authority and added to his consequence.  He was<br>
full of delight and admiration at what he saw, and did not fail to give<br>
the cardinal a favorable account of the little assembly, insomuch that<br>
the cardinal, who had a mind naturally inclined towards great things, and<br>
who loved the French language, which he himself wrote extremely well,<br>
asked if those persons would not be disposed to form a body and assembly<br>
regularly and under public authority."  Bois-Robert was intrusted with<br>
the proposal.<br>
<br>
Great was the consternation in the little voluntary and friendly Academy.<br>
"There was scarcely one of these gentlemen who did not testify<br>
displeasure: MM. de Serizay and de Maleville, who were attached to the<br>
households of the Duke of La Rochefoucauld and Marshal Bassompierre, one<br>
in retirement on his estates and the other a prisoner in the Bastille,<br>
were for refusing and excusing themselves as best they might to the<br>
cardinal.  Chapelain, who had a pension from his Eminence, represented<br>
that "in good truth he could have been well pleased to dispense with<br>
having their conferences thus bruited abroad, but in the position to<br>
which things were reduced, it was not open to them to follow the more<br>
agreeable of the two courses; they had to do with a man who willed in no<br>
half-hearted way whatever he willed, and who was not accustomed to meet<br>
resistance or to stiffer it with impunity; he would consider as an insult<br>
the disregard shown for his protection, and might visit his resentment<br>
upon each individual; he could, at any rate, easily prohibit their<br>
assemblies, breaking up by that means a society which every one of them<br>
desired to be eternal."  The arguments were strong, the members yielded;<br>
Bois-Robert was charged to thank his Eminence very humbly for the honor<br>
he did them, assuring him that they were all resolved to follow his<br>
wishes.  "I wish to be of that assembly the protector and the father,"<br>
said Richelieu, giving at once divers proofs that he took a great<br>
interest in that establishment, a fact which soon brought the Academy<br>
solicitations from those who were most intimate with the cardinal, and<br>
who, being in some sort of repute for wit, gloried in being admitted to a<br>
body which he regarded with favor.<br>
<br>
In making of this little private gathering a great national institution,<br>
Cardinal Richelieu yielded to his natural yearning for government and<br>
dominion; he protected literature as a minister and as an admirer; the<br>
admirer's inclination was supported by the minister's influence.  At the<br>
same time, and perhaps without being aware of it, he was giving French<br>
literature a centre of discipline and union whilst securing for the<br>
independence and dignity of writers a supporting-point which they had<br>
hitherto lacked.  Whilst recompensing them by favors nearly always<br>
conferred in the name of the state, he was preparing for them afar off<br>
the means of withdrawing themselves from that private dependence, the<br>
yoke of which they nearly always had to bear.  Set free at his death from<br>
the weight of their obligations to him, they became the servants of the<br>
state; ere long the French Academy had no other protector but the king.<br>
<br>
Order and rule everywhere accompanied Cardinal Richelieu; the Academy<br>
drew up its statutes, chose a director, a chancellor, and a perpetual<br>
secretary: Conrart was the first to be called to that honor; the number<br>
of Academicians was set down at forty by letters patent from the king.<br>
"As soon as God had called us to the conduct of this realm, we had for<br>
aim, not only to apply a remedy to the disorders which the civil wars had<br>
introduced into it, but also to enrich it with all ornaments suitable for<br>
the most illustrious and the most ancient of the monarchies that are at<br>
this day in the world.  Although we have labored without ceasing at the<br>
execution of this design, it hath been impossible for us hitherto to see<br>
the entire fulfilment thereof.  The disturbances so often excited in the<br>
greater part of our provinces, and the assistance we have been obliged to<br>
give to many of our allies, have diverted us from any other thought but<br>
that of war, and have hindered us for a long while from enjoying the<br>
repose we procured for others.  .  .  .  Our very clear and very much<br>
beloved cousin, the cardinal-duke of Richelieu, who hath had the part<br>
that everybody knows in all these things, hath represented to us that one<br>
of the most glorious signs of the happiness of a kingdom was that the<br>
sciences and arts should flourish there, and that letters should be in<br>
honor there as well as arms; that, after having performed so many<br>
memorable exploits, we had nothing further to do but to add agreeable<br>
things to the necessary, and ornament to utility; and he was of opinion<br>
that we could not begin better than with the most noble of all the arts,<br>
which is eloquence; that the French tongue, which up to the present hath<br>
only too keenly felt the neglect of those who might have rendered it the<br>
most perfect of the day, is more than ever capable of becoming so, seeing<br>
the number of persons who have knowledge of the advantages it possesses;<br>
it is to establish fixed rules for it that he hath ordained an assembly<br>
whose propositions were satisfactory to him.  For these reasons and in<br>
order to secure the said conferences, we will that they continue<br>
henceforth, in our good city of Paris, under the name of French Academy,<br>
and that letters patent be enregistered to that end by our gentry of the<br>
Parliament of Paris."<br>
<br>
The Parliament was not disposed to fulfil the formality of<br>
enregistration.  The cardinal had compressed it, stifled it, but he had<br>
never mastered it; the Academy was a new institution, it was regarded as<br>
his work; on that ground it inspired great distrust in the public as well<br>
as the magistrates.  "The people, to whom everything that came from this<br>
minister looked suspicious, knew not whether beneath these flowers there<br>
were not a serpent concealed, and were apprehensive that this<br>
establishment was, at the very least, a new prop to support is<br>
domination, that it was but a batch of folks in his pay, hired to<br>
maintain all that he did and to observe the actions and sentiments of<br>
others.  It went about that he cut down scavenging expenses of Paris by<br>
eighty thousand livres in order to give them a pension of two thousand<br>
livres apiece; the vulgar were so frightened, without attempting to<br>
account for their terror, that a tradesman of Paris, who had taken a<br>
house that suited him admirably in Rue Cinq Diamants, where the Academy<br>
then used to meet at M. Chapelain's, broke off his bargain on no other<br>
ground but that he did not want to be in a street where a _'Cademy of<br>
Canspirators (une Cademie e Manopoleurs)_ met every week."  The wits,<br>
like St. Evremond, in his comedy of the Academistes, turned into ridicule<br>
the body which, as it was said, claimed to subject the language of the<br>
public to its decisions:--<br>
<br>
               "So I, with hoary head, to' school<br>
               Must, like a child, go day by day,<br>
               And learn my parts of speech, poor fool, when<br>
               Death is taking speech away!"<br>
<br>
said Maynard, who, nevertheless, was one of the forty.<br>
<br>
The letters patent for establishment of the French Academy had been sent<br>
to the Parliament in 1635; they were not registered until 1637 at the<br>
express instance of the cardinal, who wrote to the premier President to<br>
assure him that "the foundation of the Academy was useful and necessary<br>
to the public, and the purpose of the Academicians was quite different<br>
from what it had been possible to make people believe hitherto."<br>
<br>
The decree of verification, when it at length appeared, bore traces of<br>
the jealous prejudices of the Parliament.  "They the said assembly and<br>
academy," it ran, "shall not be powered to take cognizance of anything<br>
but the ornamentation, embellishment, and augmentation of the French<br>
language, and of the books that shall be made by them and by other<br>
persons who shall desire it and want it."<br>
<br>
The French Academy was founded; it was already commencing its Dictionary<br>
in accordance with the suggestion enunciated by Chapelain at the second<br>
meeting; the cardinal was here carrying out that great moral idea of<br>
literature which he had expressed but lately in a letter to Balzac: "The<br>
conceptions in your letters," said he, "are forcible and as far removed<br>
from ordinary imaginations as they are in conformity with the common<br>
sense of those who have superior judgment.  Truth has this advantage,<br>
that it forces those who have eyes and mind sufficiently clear to discern<br>
what it is to represent it without disguise."  Neither Balzac and his<br>
friends, nor the protection of Cardinal Richelieu, sufficed as yet to<br>
give lustre to the Academy; great minds and great writers alone could<br>
make the glory of their society.  The principle of the association of men<br>
of letters was, however, established: men of the world, friendly to<br>
literature, were already preparing to mingle with them; the literary,<br>
but lately servitors of the great, had henceforth at their disposal a<br>
privilege envied and sought after by courtiers; their independence grew<br>
by it and their dignity gained by it.  The French Academy became an<br>
institution, and took its place amongst the glories of France.  It had<br>
this piece of good fortune, that Cardinal Richelieu died without being<br>
able to carry out the project he had conceived.  He had intended to open<br>
on the site of the horse-market, near Porte St. Honore and behind the<br>
Palais-Cardinal, "a great Place which he would have called Ducale in<br>
imitation of the Royale, which is at the other end of the city," says<br>
Pellisson; he had placed in the hands of M. de la Mesnardiere, a<br>
memorandum drawn up by himself for the plan of a college "which he was<br>
meditating for all the noble sciences, and in which he designed to employ<br>
all that was most telling for the cause of literature in Europe.  He had<br>
an idea of making the members of the Academy directors and as it were<br>
arbiters of this great establishment, and aspired, with a feeling worthy<br>
of the immortality with which he was so much in love, to set up the<br>
French Academy there in the most distinguished position in the world, and<br>
to offer an honorable and pleasant repose to all persons of that class<br>
who had deserved it by their labors."  It was a noble and a liberal idea,<br>
worthy of the great mind which had conceived it; but it would have<br>
stifled the fertile germ of independence and liberty which he had<br>
unconsciously buried in the womb of the French Academy.  Pensioned and<br>
barracked, the Academicians would have remained men of letters, shut off<br>
from society and the world.  The Academy grew up alone, favored indeed,<br>
but never reduced to servitude; it alone has withstood the cruel shocks<br>
which have for so long a time agitated France; in a country where nothing<br>
lasts, it has lasted, with its traditions, its primitive statutes, its<br>
reminiscences, its respect for the past.  It has preserved its courteous<br>
and modest dignity, its habits of polite neutrality, the suavity and<br>
equality of the relations between its members.  It was said just now that<br>
Richelieu's work no longer existed save in history, and that revolutions<br>
have left him nothing but his glory; but that was a mistake: the French<br>
Academy is still standing, stronger and freer than at its birth, and it<br>
was founded by Richelieu, and has never forgotten him.<br>
<br>
Amongst the earliest members of the Academy the cardinal had placed his<br>
most habitual and most intimate literary servants, Bois-Robert,<br>
Desmarets, Colletet, all writers for the theatre, employed by Richelieu<br>
in his own dramatic attempts.  Theatrical representations were the only<br>
pleasure the minister enjoyed, in accord with the public of his day.  He<br>
had everywhere encouraged this taste, supporting with marked favor ,<br>
Hardy and the _Theatre Parisien_.  With his mind constantly exercised by<br>
the wants of the government, he soon sought in the theatre a means of<br>
acting upon the masses.  He had already foreseen the power of the press;<br>
he had laid hands on Doctor Renaudot's _Gazette de France;_ King Louis<br>
XIII. often wrote articles in it; the manuscript exists in the National<br>
Library, with some corrections which appear to be Richelieu's.  As for<br>
the theatre, the cardinal aspired to try his own hand at the work; his<br>
literary labors were nearly all political pieces; his tragedy of<br>
_Mirame,_ to which he attached so much value, and which he had<br>
represented at such great expense for the opening of his theatre in the<br>
Palais-Cardinal, is nothing but one continual allusion, often bold even<br>
to insolence, to Buckingham's feelings towards Anne of Austria.  The<br>
comedy, in heroic style, of Europe, which appeared in the name of<br>
_Desmarets,_ after the cardinal's death, is a political allegory touching<br>
the condition of the world.  Francion and Ibere contend together for the<br>
favors of Europe, not without, at the same time, paying court to the<br>
Princess Austrasia (Lorraine).  All the cardinal's foreign policy, his<br>
alliances with Protestants, are there described in verses which do not<br>
lack a certain force: Germanique (the emperor) pleads the cause of Ibere<br>
with Europe:--<br>
<br>
          "No longer can he brook to gaze on such as these,<br>
          Destroyers of the shrines, foes of the Deities,<br>
          By Francion evoked from out the Frozen Main,[1]<br>
          That he might cope with us and equal war maintain.<br>

          Who 'midst my champions hold honorable place.<br>
          Unlike to us, they own no shrine, no sacrifice;<br>
          But still, unlike Ibere, they use no artifice;<br>
          About the Gods they speak their mind as seemeth best,<br>
          Whilst he, with pious air, still keepeth me opprest;<br>
          Through them I hold mine own, from harm and insult free,<br>
          Their errors I deplore, their valor pleases me.<br>

          Within thine own domains, and many a laurel won?<br>
          Who, wasting not his strength in strife with granite walls,<br>

Already, in Mirame, Richelieu had celebrated the fall of Rochelle and of<br>
the Huguenot party, bringing upon the scene the King of Bithynia, who is<br>
taking arms<br>
<br>
                         "To tame a rebel slave,<br>
          Perched proudly on his rock washed by the ocean-wave."<br>
<br>
As epigraph to Europe there were these lines:--<br>
<br>
          "All friends of France to this my work will friendly be;<br>
          And all unfriends of her will say the author ill;<br>
          Yet shall I be content, say, reader, what you will;<br>
          The joy of some, the rage of others, pleases me."<br>
<br>
The enemies of France did not wait for the comedy, in heroic style, of<br>
Europe in order to frequently say ill of Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
<br>
Occupied as he was in governing the affairs of France and of Europe<br>
otherwise than in verse, the cardinal chose out work-fellows; there were<br>
five of them, to whom he gave his ideas and the plan of his piece; he<br>
intrusted to each the duty of writing an act, and "by this means finished<br>
a comedy a month," says Pellisson.  Thus was composed the comedy of the<br>
_Tuileries_ and the _Aveugle de Smyrne,_ which were printed in 1638;<br>
Richelieu had likewise taken part in the composition of the _Visionnaires<br>
of Desmarets,_ and supported in a rather remarkable scene the rule of the<br>
three unities against its detractors.  A new comedy, the _Grande<br>
Pastorale,_ was in hand.  "When he was purposing to publish it," says the<br>
_History of the Academy,_ "he desired M. Chapelain to look over it, and<br>
make careful observations upon it.  These observations were brought to<br>
him by M. de Bois-Robert, and, though they were written with much<br>
discretion and respect, they shocked and nettled him to such a degree,<br>
either by their number or by the consciousness they caused him of his<br>
faults, that, without reading them through, he tore them up.  But on the<br>
following night, when he was in bed, and all his household asleep, having<br>
thought over the anger he had shown, be did a thing incomparably more<br>
estimable than the best comedy in the world, that is to say, he listened<br>
to reason, for he gave orders to collect and glue together the pieces of<br>
that torn paper, and, having read it from one end to the other, and given<br>
great thought to it, he sent and awakened M. de Bois-Robert to tell him<br>
that he saw quite well that the gentlemen of the Academy were better<br>
informed about such matters than he, and that there must be nothing more<br>
said about that paper and print."<br>
<br>
The cardinal ended by permitting the liberties taken in literary matters<br>
by Chapelain and even Colletet.  His courtiers were complimenting him<br>
about some success or other obtained by the king's arms, saying that<br>
nothing could withstand his Eminence.  "You are mistaken," he answered,<br>
laughing; "and I find even in Paris persons who withstand me.  There's<br>
Colletet, who, after having fought with me yesterday over a word, does<br>
not give in yet; look at this long letter that he has just written me!"<br>
He counted, at any rate, in the number of his five work-fellows one mind<br>
too independent to be subservient for long to the ideas and wishes of<br>
another, though it were Cardinal Richelieu and the premier minister.  In<br>
conjunction with Colletet, Bois-Robert, De l'Etoile, and Rotrou, Peter<br>
Corneille worked at his Eminence's tragedies and comedies.  He handled<br>
according to his fancy the act intrusted to him, with so much freedom<br>
that the cardinal was shocked, and said that he lacked, in his opinion,<br>
"the follower-spirit" (_l'esprit de suite_).  Corneille did not appeal<br>
from this judgment; he quietly took the road to Rouen, leaving henceforth<br>
to his four work-fellows the glory of putting into form the ideas of the<br>
all-powerful minister; he worked alone, for his own hand, for the glory<br>
of France and of the human mind.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: Peter Corneille----334]<br>
<br>
Peter Corneille, born at Rouen on the 6th of June, 1606, in a family of<br>
lawyers, had been destined for the bar from his infancy; he was a<br>
briefless barrister; his father had purchased him two government posts,<br>
but his heart was otherwise set than "on jurisprudence;" in 1635, when he<br>
quietly renounced the honor of writing for the cardinal, Corneille had<br>
already had several comedies played.  He himself said of the first,<br>
_Melite,_ which he wrote at three and twenty, "It was my first attempt,<br>
and it has no pretence of being according to the rules, for I did not<br>
know then that there were any.  I had for guide nothing but a little<br>
common sense, together with the models of the late Hardy, whose vein was<br>
rather fertile than polished."  "The comedies of Corneille had met with<br>
success; praised as he was by his competitors in the career of the<br>
theatre, he was as yet, in their eyes, but one of the supports of that<br>
literary glory which was common to them all.  Tranquil in their<br>
possession of bad taste, they were far from foreseeing the revolution<br>
which was about to overthrow its sway and their own."  [_Corneille et son<br>
Temps,_ by M. Guizot.]<br>
<br>
Corneille made his first appearance in tragedy, in 1633, with a _Medee_.<br>
"Here are verses which proclaim Corneille," said Voltaire:--<br>
<br>
          "After so many boons, to leave me can he bear?<br>
          After so many sins, to leave me can he dare?"<br>
<br>
They proclaimed tragedy; it had appeared at last to Corneille; its<br>
features, roughly sketched, were nevertheless recognizable.  He was<br>
already studying Spanish with an old friend of his family, and was<br>
working at the _Cid,_ when he brought out his _Illusion Comique,_ a<br>
mediocre piece, Corneille's last sacrifice to the taste of his day.<br>
Towards the end of the year 1636, the _Cid_ was played for the first time<br>
at Paris.  There was a burst of enthusiasm forthwith.  "I wish you were<br>
here," wrote the celebrated comedian Mondory to Balzac, on the 18th of<br>
January, 1637, "to enjoy amongst other pleasures that of the beautiful<br>
comedies that are being played, and especially a _Cid_ who has charmed<br>
all Paris.  So beautiful is he that he has smitten with love all the most<br>
virtuous ladies, whose passion has many times blazed out in the public<br>
theatre.  Seated in a body on the benches of the boxes have been seen<br>
those who are commonly seen only in gilded chamber and on the seat with<br>
the fleurs-de-lis.  So great has been the throng at our doors, and our<br>
place has turned out so small, that the corners of the theatre, which<br>
served at other times as niches for the pageboys, have been given as a<br>
favor to blue ribbons, and the scene has been embellished, ordinarily,<br>
with the crosses of knights of the order."  "It is difficult," says<br>
Pellisson, "to imagine with what approbation this piece was received by<br>
court and people."  It was impossible to tire of seeing it, nothing else<br>
was talked of in company; everybody knew some portion by heart; it was<br>
taught to children, and in many parts of France it had passed into a<br>
proverb to say, "Beautiful as the _Cid_."  Criticism itself was silenced<br>
for a while; carried along in the general twirl, bewildered by its<br>
success, the rivals of Corneille appeared to join the throng of his<br>
admirers; but they soon recovered their breath, and their first sign of<br>
life was an effort of resistance to the torrent which threatened to carry<br>
them away; with the exception of Rotrou, who was worthy to comprehend and<br>
enjoy Corneille, the revolt was unanimous.  The malcontents and the<br>
envious had found in Richelieu an eager and a powerful auxiliary.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: The Representation of "the Cid."----335]<br>
<br>
Many attempts have been made to fathom the causes of the cardinal's<br>
animosity to the _Cid_.  It was a Spanish piece, and represented in a<br>
favorable light the traditional enemies of France and of Richelieu; it<br>
was all in honor of the duel which the cardinal had prosecuted with such<br>
rigorous justice; it depicted a king simple, patriarchal, genial in the<br>
exercise of his power, contrary to all the views cherished by the<br>
minister touching royal majesty; all these reasons might have contributed<br>
to his wrath, but there was something more personal and petty in its<br>
bitterness.  In tacit disdain for the work that had been entrusted to<br>
him, Corneille had abandoned Richelieu's pieces; he had retired to Rouen;<br>
far away from the court, he had only his successes to set against the<br>
perfidious insinuations of his rivals.  The triumph of the _Cid_ seemed<br>
to the resentful spirit of a neglected and irritated patron a sort of<br>
insult.  Therewith was mingled a certain shade of author's jealousy.<br>
Richelieu saw in the fame of Corneille the success of a rebel.  Egged on<br>
by base and malicious influences, he attempted to crush him as he had<br>
crushed the house of Austria and the Huguenots.<br>
<br>
The cabal of bad taste enlisted to a man in this new war.  Scudery was<br>
standard-bearer; astounded that such fantastic beauties should have<br>
seduced knowledge as well as ignorance, and the court as well as the cit,<br>
and conjuring decent folks to suspend judgment for a while, and not<br>
condemn without a hearing _Sophonisbe, Cesar, Cleopdtre, Hercule,<br>
Marianne, Cleomedon,_ and so many other illustrious heroes who had<br>
charmed them on the stage."  Corneille might have been satisfied; his<br>
adversaries themselves recognized his great popularity and success.<br>
<br>
A singular mixture of haughtiness and timidity, of vigorous imagination<br>
and simplicity of judgment!  It was by his triumphs that Corneille had<br>
become informed of his talents; but, when once aware, he had accepted the<br>
conviction thereof as that of those truths which one does not arrive at<br>
by one's self absolutely, without explanation, without modification.<br>
<br>
          "I know my worth, and well believe men's rede of it;<br>
          I have no need of leagues, to make myself admired;<br>
          Few voices may be raised for me, but none is hired;<br>
          To swell th' applause my just ambition seeks no claque,<br>
          Nor out of holes and corners hunts the hireling pack:<br>
          Upon the boards, quite self-supported, mount my plays,<br>
          And every one is free to censure or to praise;<br>
          There, though no friends expound their views or preach my<br>
          cause,<br>
          It hath been many a time my lot to win applause;<br>
          There, pleased with the success my modest merit won,<br>
          With brilliant critics' laws I seek to dazzle none;<br>
          To court and people both I give the same delight,<br>
          Mine only partisans the verses that I write;<br>
          To them alone I owe the credit of my pen,<br>
          To my own self alone the fame I win of men;<br>
          And if, when rivals meet, I claim equality,<br>
          Methinks I do no wrong to whosoe'er it be."<br>
<br>
"Let him rise on the wings of composition," said La Bruyere, "and he is<br>
not below Augustus, Pompey, Nicodemus, Sertorius; he is a king and a<br>
great king; he is a politician, he is a philosopher."  Modest and bashfnl<br>
in what concerns himself, when it has nothing to do with his works and<br>
his talents, Corneille, who does not disdain to receive a pension from<br>
Cardinal Richelieu, or, in writing to Scudery, to call him "your master<br>
and and mine," becomes quite another creature when he defends his genius:<br>
<br>
          "Leaving full oft the earth, soon as he leaves the goal,<br>
          With lofty flight he soars into the upper air,<br>
          Looks down on envious men, and smiles at their despair."<br>
<br>
The contest was becoming fierce and bitter; much was written for and<br>
against the _Cid;_ the public remained faithful to it; the cardinal<br>
determined to submit it to the judgment of the Academy, thus exacting<br>
from that body an act of complaisance towards himself as well as an act<br>
of independence and authority in the teeth of predominant opinion.  At<br>
his instigation, Scudery wrote to the Academy to make them the judges in<br>
the dispute.  "The cardinal's desire was plain to see," says Pellisson;<br>
"but the most judicious amongst that body testified a great deal of<br>
repugnance to this design.  They said that the Academy, which was only in<br>
its cradle, ought not to incur odium by a judgment which might perhaps<br>
displease both parties, and which could not fail to cause umbrage to one<br>
at least, that is to say, to a great part of France; that they were<br>
scarcely tolerated, from the mere fancy which prevailed that they<br>
pretended to some authority over the French tongue; what would be the<br>
case if they proved to have exercised it in respect of a work which had<br>
pleased the majority and won the approbation of the people?  M. Corneille<br>
did not ask for this judgment, and, by the statutes of the Academy, they<br>
could only sit in judgment upon a work with the consent and at the<br>
entreaty of the author."  Corneille did not facilitate the task of the<br>
Academicians: he excused himself modestly, protesting that such<br>
occupation was not worthy of such a body, that a mere piece<br>
(_un libelle_) did not deserve their judgment.  .  .  .  "At length,<br>
under pressure from M. de Bois-Robert, who gave him pretty plainly to<br>
understand what was his master's desire, this answer slipped from him:<br>
'The gentlemen of the Academy can do as they please; since you write me<br>
word that my Lord would like to see their judgment, and it would divert<br>
his Eminence, I have nothing further to say.'"<br>
<br>
These expressions were taken as a formal consent, and as the Academy<br>
still excused themselves, " Let those gentlemen know," said the cardinal<br>
at last, "that I desire it, and that I shall love them as they love me."<br>
<br>
There was nothing for it but to obey.  Whilst Bois-Robert was amusing his<br>
master by representing before him a parody of the _Cid,_ played by his<br>
lackeys and scullions, the Academy was at work drawing up their<br>
Sentiments respecting the _Cid_.<br>
<br>
Thrice submitted to the cardinal, who thrice sent it back with some<br>
strong remarks appended, the judgment of the Academicians did not succeed<br>
in satisfying the minister.  "What was wanted was the complaisance of<br>
submission, what was obtained was only that of gratitude."  "I know quite<br>
well," says Pellisson, "that his Eminence would have wished to have the<br>
_Cid_ more roughly handled, if he had not been adroitly made to<br>
understand that a judge must not speak like a party to a suit, and that<br>
in proportion as he showed passion, he would lose authority."<br>
<br>
Balzac, still in retirement at his country-place, made no mistake as to<br>
the state of mind either in the Academy or in the world when he wrote to<br>
Scudery, who had sent him his _Observations sur le Cid,_ "Reflect, sir,<br>
that all France takes sides with M. Corneille, and that there is not one,<br>
perhaps, of the judges with whom it is rumored that you have come to an<br>
agreement, who has not praised that which you desire him to condemn; so<br>
that, though your arguments were incontrovertible and your adversary<br>
should acquiesce therein, he would still have the wherewith to give<br>
himself glorious consolation for the loss of his case, and be able to<br>
tell you that it is something more to have delighted a whole kingdom than<br>
to have written a piece according to regulation.  This being so, I doubt<br>
not that the gentlemen of the Academy will find themselves much hampered<br>
in delivering a judgment on your case, and that, on the one hand, your<br>
arguments will stagger them, whilst, on the other, the public approbation<br>
will keep them in check.  You have the best of it in the closet; he has<br>
the advantage on the stage.  If the _Cid_ be guilty, it is of a crime<br>
which has met with reward; if he be punished, it will be after having<br>
triumphed; if Plato must banish him from his republic, he must crown him<br>
with flowers whilst banishing him, and not treat him worse than he<br>
formerly treated Homer."<br>
<br>
The Sentiments de l'Academie at last saw the light in the month of<br>
December, 1637, and as Chapelain had foreseen, they did not completely<br>
satisfy either the cardinal or Scudery, in spite of the thanks which the<br>
latter considered himself bound to express to that body, or Corneille,<br>
who testified bitter displeasure.  "The Academy proceeds against me with<br>
so much violence, and employs so supreme an authority to close my mouth,<br>
that all the satisfaction I have is to think that this famous production,<br>
at which so many fine intellects have been working for six months, may no<br>
doubt be esteemed the opinion of the French Academy, but will probably<br>
not be the opinion of the rest of Paris.  I wrote the _Cid_ for my<br>
diversion and that of decent folks who like Comedy.  All the favor that<br>
the opinion of the Academy can hope for is to make as much way; at any<br>
rate, I have had my account settled before them, and I am not at all sure<br>
that they can wait for theirs."<br>
<br>
Corneille did not care to carry his resentment higher than the Academy.<br>
At the end of December, 1637, when writing to Bois-Robert a letter of<br>
thanks for getting him his pension, which he calls "the liberalities of<br>
my Lord," he adds, "As you advise me not to reply to the _Sentiments de<br>
l'Academie,_ seeing what personages are concerned therein, there is no<br>
need of interpreters to understand that; I am somewhat more of this world<br>
than Heliodorus was, who preferred to lose his bishopric rather than his<br>
book; and I prefer my master's good graces to all the reputations on<br>
earth.  I shall be mum, then, not from disdain, but from respect."<br>
<br>
The great Corneille made no further defence he had become a servitor<br>
again; but the public, less docile, persisted in their opinion.<br>
<br>
          "In vain against the Cid a minister makes league;<br>
          All Paris, gazing on Chimene, thinks with Rodrigue;<br>
          In vain to censure her th' Academy aspires;<br>
          The stubborn populace revolts and still admires; "<br>
<br>
said Boileau subsequently.<br>
<br>
The dispute was ended, and, in spite of the judgment of the Academy, the<br>
cardinal did not come out of it victorious; his anger, however, had<br>
ceased: the Duchess of Aiguillon, his niece, accepted the dedication of<br>
the _Cid;_ when _Horace_ appeared, in 1639, the dedicatory epistle,<br>
addressed to the cardinal, proved that Corneille read his works to him<br>
beforehand; the cabal appeared for a while on the point of making head<br>
again.  "_Horace,_ condemned by the decemvirs, was acquitted by the<br>
people," said Corneille.  The same year _Cinna_ came to give the<br>
finishing touch to the reputation of the great poet:--<br>
<br>
          "To the persecuted Cid the Cinna owed its birth."<br>
<br>
Corneille had withdrawn to the obscurity which suited the simplicity of<br>
his habits; the cardinal, it was said, had helped him to get married; he<br>
had no longer to defend his works, their fame was amply sufficient.<br>
"Henceforth Corneille walks freely by himself and in the strength of his<br>
own powers; the circle of his ideas grows larger, his style grows loftier<br>
and stronger, together with his thoughts, and purer, perhaps, without his<br>
dreaming of it; a more correct, a more precise expression comes to him,<br>
evoked by greater clearness in idea, greater fixity of sentiment; genius,<br>
with the mastery of means, seeks new outlets.  Corneille writes<br>
_Polyeucte_."  [_Corneille et son Temps,_ by M. Guizot.]<br>
<br>
It was a second revolution accomplished for the upsetting of received<br>
ideas, at a time when paganism was to such an extent master of the<br>
theatre that, in the midst of an allegory of the seventeenth century,<br>
alluding to Gustavus Adolphus and the wars of religion, Richelieu and<br>
Desmarets, in the heroic comedy of _Europe,_ dared not mention the name<br>
of God save in the plural.  Corneille read his piece at the Hotel<br>
Rambouillet.  "It was applauded to the extent demanded by propriety and<br>
the reputation already achieved by the author," says Fontenelle; "but<br>
some days afterwards, M. de Voiture went to call upon M. Corneille, and<br>
took a very delicate way of telling him that _Polyeucte_ had not been so<br>
successful as he supposed, that the Christianism had been extremely<br>
displeasing."  "The story is," adds Voltaire, "that all the Hotel<br>
Rambouillet, and especially the Bishop of Vence, Godeau, condemned the<br>
attempt of _Polyeucte_ to overthrow idols."  Corneille, in alarm, would<br>
have withdrawn the piece from the hands of the comedians who were<br>
learning it, and he only left it on the assurance of one of the<br>
comedians, who did not play in it because he was too bad an actor.<br>
Posterity has justified the poor comedian against the Hotel Rambouillet;<br>
amongst so many of Corneille's masterpieces it has ever given a place<br>
apart to _Polyeucte;_ neither the _Saint-Genest_ of Rotrou, nor the<br>
_Zaire_ of Voltaire, in spite of their various beauties, have dethroned<br>
_Polyeucte;_ in fame as well as in date it remains the first of the few<br>
pieces in which Christianism appeared, to gain applause, upon the French<br>
classic stage.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: Corneille at the Hotel Rambouillet---342]<br>
<br>
Richelieu was no longer there to lay his commands upon the court and upon<br>
the world: he was dead, without having been forgiven by Corneille:--<br>
<br>
         "Of our great cardinal let men speak as they will,<br>
          By me, in prose or verse, they shall not be withstood;<br>
          He did me too much good for me to say him ill,<br>
          He did me too much ill for me to say him good!"<br>
<br>
The great literary movement of the seventeenth century had begun; it had<br>
no longer any need of a protector; it was destined to grow up alone<br>
during twenty years, amidst troubles at home and wars abroad, to flourish<br>
all at once, with incomparable splendor, under the reign and around the<br>
throne of Louis XIV.  Cardinal Richelieu, however, had the honor of<br>
protecting its birth; he had taken personal pleasure in it; he had<br>
comprehended its importance and beauty; he had desired to serve it whilst<br>
taking the direction of it.  Let us end, as we began, with the judgment<br>
of La Bruyere: "Compare yourselves, if you dare, with the great<br>
Richelieu, you men devoted to fortune, you who say that you know nothing,<br>
that you have read nothing, that you will read nothing.  Learn that<br>
Cardinal Richelieu did know, did read; I say not that he had no<br>
estrangement from men of letters, but that he loved them, caressed them,<br>
favored them, that he contrived privileges for them, that he appointed<br>
pensions for them, that he united them in a celebrated body, and that he<br>
made of them the French Academy."<br>
<br>
The Academy, the Sorbonne, the Botanic Gardens (_Jardin des Plantes_),<br>
the King's Press have endured; the theatre has grown and been enriched by<br>
many masterpieces, the press has become the most dreaded of powers; all<br>
the new forces that Richelieu created or foresaw have become developed<br>
without him, frequently in opposition to him and to the work of his whole<br>
life; his name has remained connected with the commencement of all these<br>
wonders, beneficial or disastrous, which he had grasped and presaged, in<br>
a future happily concealed from his ken.<br>

CHAPTER XLIII.----LOUIS XIV., THE FRONDE, AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CARDINAL<br>
MAZARIN.  (1643-1661.)<br>
<br>
[Illustration: LOUIS XIV.----344]<br>
<br>
Louis XIII. had never felt confidence in the queen his wife; and Cardinal<br>
Richelieu had fostered that sentiment which promoted his views.  When M.<br>
de Chavigny came, on Anne of Austria's behalf, to assure the dying king<br>
that she had never had any part in the conspiracy of Chalais, or dreamt<br>
of espousing Monsieur in case she was left a widow, Louis XIII.<br>
answered, "Considering the state I am in, I am bound to forgive her, but<br>
not to believe her."  He did not believe her, he never had believed her,<br>
and his declaration touching the Regency was entirely directed towards<br>
counteracting by anticipation the power intrusted to his wife and his<br>
brother.  The queen's regency and the Duke of Orleans' lieutenant-<br>
generalship were in some sort subordinated to a council composed of the<br>
Prince of Conde, Cardinal Mazarin, Chancellor Seguier, Superintendent<br>
Bouthillier, and Secretary of State Chavigny, "with a prohibition against<br>
introducing any change therein, for any cause or on any occasion<br>
whatsoever."  The queen and the Duke of Orleans had signed and sworn the<br>
declaration.<br>
<br>
King Louis XIII. was not yet in his grave when his last wishes were<br>
violated; before his death the queen had made terms with the ministers;<br>
the course to be followed had been decided.  On the 18th of May, 1643,<br>
the queen, having brought back the little king to Paris, conducted him in<br>
great state to the Parliament of Paris to hold his bed of justice there.<br>
The boy sat down and said with a good grace that he had come to the<br>
Parliament to testify his good will to it, and that his chancellor would<br>
say the rest.  The Duke of Orleans then addressed the queen.  "The honor<br>
of the regency is the due altogether of your Majesty," said he, "not only<br>
in your capacity of mother, but also for your merits and virtues; the<br>
regency having been confined to you by the deceased king, and by the<br>
consent of all the grandees of the realm, I desire no other part in<br>
affairs than that which it may please your Majesty to give me, and I do<br>
not claim to take any advantage from the special clauses contained in the<br>
declaration."  The Prince of Condo said much the same thing, but with<br>
less earnestness, and on the evening of the same day the queen regent,<br>
having sole charge of the administration of affairs, and modifying the<br>
council at her pleasure, announced to the astounded court that she should<br>
retain by her Cardinal Mazarin.  Not a word had been said about him at<br>
the Parliament; the courtiers believed that he was on the point of<br>
leaving France; but the able Italian, attractive as he was subtle, had<br>
already found a way to please the queen.  She retained as chief of her<br>
council the heir to the traditions of Richelieu, and deceived the hopes<br>
of the party of Importants, those meddlers of the court at whose head<br>
marched the Duke of Beaufort, all puffed up with the confidence lately<br>
shown to him by her Majesty.  Potier, Bishop of Beauvais, the queen's<br>
confidant during her troubles, "expected to be all-powerful in the state;<br>
he sought out the Duke of Orleans and the Prince of  Conde, promising<br>
them governorships of places, and, generally, anything they might desire.<br>
He thought he could set the affairs of state going as easily as he could<br>
his parish-priests; but the poor prelate came down from his high hopes<br>
when he saw that the cardinal was advancing more and more in the queen's<br>
confidence, and that, for him, too much was already thought to have been<br>
done in according him admittance to the council, whilst flattering him<br>
with a hope of the purple." [_Memoires de Brienne,_ ii. 37.]<br>
<br>
Cardinal Mazarin soon sent him off to his diocese.  Continuing to humor<br>
all parties, and displaying foresight and prudence, the new minister was<br>
even now master.  Louis XIII., without any personal liking, had been<br>
faithful to Richelieu to the death; with different feelings, Anne of<br>
Austria was to testify the same constancy towards Mazarin.<br>
<br>
A stroke of fortune came at the very first to strengthen the regent's<br>
position.  Since the death of Cardinal Richelieu, the Spaniards, but<br>
recently overwhelmed at the close df 1642, had recovered courage and<br>
boldness; new counsels prevailed at the court of Philip IV., who had<br>
dismissed Olivarez; the house of Austria vigorously resumed the<br>
offensive; at the moment of Louis XIII.'s death, Don Francisco de Mello,<br>
governor of the Low Countries, had just invaded French territory by way<br>
of the Ardennes, and laid siege to Rocroi, on the 12th of May.  The<br>
French army was commanded by the young Duke of Enghien, the Prince of<br>
Conde's son, scarcely twenty-two years old; Louis XIII. had given him as<br>
his lieutenant and director the veteran Marshal de l'Hopital; and the<br>
latter feared to give battle.  The Duke of Enghien, who "was dying with<br>
impatience to enter the enemy's country, resolved to accomplish by<br>
address what he could not carry by authority.  He opened his heart to<br>
Gassion alone.  As he was a man who saw nothing but what was easy even in<br>
the most dangerous deeds, he had very soon brought matters to the point<br>
that the prince desired.  Marshal de l'Hopital found himself<br>
imperceptibly so near the Spaniards that it was impossible for him any<br>
longer to hinder an engagement."  [_Relation de 31 de la Houssaye._] The<br>
army was in front of Rocroi, and out of the dangerous defile which led to<br>
the place, without any idea on the part of the marshal and the army that<br>
Louis XIII. was dead.  The Duke of Enghien, who had received the news,<br>
had kept it secret.  He had merely said in the tone of a master "that he<br>
meant to fight, and would answer for the issue.  His orders given, he<br>
passed along the ranks of his army with an air which communicated to it<br>
the same impatience that he himself felt to see the night over, in order<br>
to begin the battle.  He passed the whole of it at the camp-fire of the<br>
officers of Picardy."  In the morning "it was necessary to rouse from<br>
deep slumber this second Alexander.  Mark him as he flies to victory or<br>
death!  As soon as he had kindled from rank to rank the ardor with which<br>
he was animated, he was seen, in almost the same moment, driving in the<br>
enemy's right, supporting ours that wavered, rallying the half-beaten<br>
French, putting to flight the victorious Spaniards, striking terror<br>
everywhere, and dumbfounding with his flashing looks those who escaped<br>
from his blows.  There remained that dread infantry of the army of Spain,<br>
whose huge battalions, in close order, like so many towers, but towers<br>
that could repair their breaches, remained unshaken amidst all the rest<br>
of the rout, and delivered their fire on all sides.  Thrice the young<br>
conqueror tried to break these fearless warriors; thrice he was driven<br>
knack by the valiant Count of Fuentes, who was seen carried about in his<br>
chair, and, in spite of his infirmities, showing that a warrior's soul is<br>
mistress of the body it animates.  But yield they must: in vain through<br>
the woods, with his cavalry all fresh, does Beck rush down to fall upon<br>
our exhausted men the prince has been beforehand with him; the broken<br>
battalions cry for quarter, but the victory is to be more terrible than<br>
the fight for the Duke of Enghien.  Whilst with easy mien he advances to<br>
receive the parole of these brave fellows, they, watchful still,<br>
apprehend the surprise of a fresh attack; their terrible volley drives<br>
our men mad; there is nothing to be seen but slaughter; the soldier is<br>
drunk with blood, till that great prince, who could not bear to see such<br>
lions butchered like so many sheep, calmed excited passions, and to the<br>
pleasure of victory joined that of mercy.  He would willingly have saved<br>
the life of the brave Count of Fuentes, but found him lying amidst<br>
thousands of the dead whose loss is still felt by Spain.  The prince<br>
bends the knee, and, on the field of battle, renders thanks to the God of<br>
armies for the victory he hath given him.  Then were there rejoicings<br>
over Rocroi delivered, the threats of a dread enemy converted to their<br>
shame, the regency strengthened, France at rest, and a reign, which was<br>
to be so noble, commenced with such happy augury."  [Bossuet, _Oraison<br>
funebre de Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conde._]  Victory or death, below<br>
the cross of Burgundy, was borne upon most of the standards taken from<br>
the Imperialists; and "indeed," says the Gazette de France, "the most<br>
part were found dead in the ranks where they had been posted.  Which was<br>
nobly brought home by one of the prisoners to our captains when, being<br>
asked how many there had been of them, he replied, "Count the dead."<br>
Conde was worthy to fight such enemies, and Bossuet to recount their<br>
defeat.  "The prince was a born captain," said Cardinal de Retz.  And all<br>
France said so with him, on hearing of the victory of Rocroi.<br>
<br>
The delight was all the keener in the queen's circle, because the house<br>
of Conde openly supported Cardinal Mazarin, bitterly attacked as he was<br>
by the Importants, who accused him of reviving the tyranny of Richelieu.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: The Great Conde----348]<br>
<br>
A ditty on the subject was current in the streets of Paris:--<br>
<br>
          "He is not dead, he is but changed of age,<br>
          The cardinal, at whom men gird with rage,<br>
          But all his household make thereat great cheer;<br>
          It pleaseth not full many a chevalier<br>
          They fain had brought him to the lowest stage.<br>
          Beneath his wing came all his lineage,<br>
          By the same art whereof he made usage<br>
          And, by my faith, 'tis still their day, I fear.<br>
                         He is not dead.<br>
<br>
          "Hush! we are mum, because we dread the cage<br>
          For he's at court--this eminent personage<br>
          There to remain of years to come a score.<br>
          Ask those Importants, would you fain know more<br>
          And they will say in dolorous language,<br>
                        'He is not dead.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
And indeed, on pretext offered by a feminine quarrel between the young<br>
Duchess of Longueville, daughter of the Prince of Conde, and the Duchess<br>
of Montbazon, the Duke of Beaufort and some of his friends resolved to<br>
assassinate the cardinal.  The attempt was a failure, but the Duke of<br>
Beaufort, who was arrested on the 2d of September, was taken to the<br>
castle of Vincennes.  Madame de Chevreuse, recently returned to court,<br>
where she would fain have exacted from the queen the reward for her<br>
services and her past sufferings, was sent into exile, as well as the<br>
Duke of Vendome.  Madame d'Hautefort, but lately summoned by Anne of<br>
Austria to be near her, was soon involved in the same disgrace.  Proud<br>
and compassionate, without any liking for Mazarin, she was daring enough,<br>
during a trip to Vincennes, to ask pardon for the Duke of Beaufort.<br>
"The queen made no answer, and, the collation being served, Madame<br>
d'Hautefort, whose heart was full, ate nothing; when she was asked why,<br>
she declared that she could not enjoy anything in such close proximity to<br>
that poor boy."  The queen could not put up with reproaches; and she<br>
behaved with extreme coldness to Madame d'Hautefort.  One day, at<br>
bedtime, her ill temper showed itself so plainly, that the old favorite<br>
could no longer be in doubt about the queen's sentiments.  As she softly<br>
closed the curtains, "I do assure you, Madame," she said, "that if I had<br>
served God with as much attachment and devotion as I have your Majesty<br>
all my life, I should be a great saint."  And, raising her eyes to the<br>
crucifix, she added, "Thou knowest, Lord, what I have done for her."  The<br>
queen let her go to the convent where Mademoiselle de la Fayette had<br>
taken refuge ten years before.  Madame d'Hautefort left it ere long to<br>
become the wife of Marshal Schomberg; but the party of the Importants was<br>
dead, and the power of Cardinal Mazarin seemed to be firmly established.<br>
"It was not the thing just then for any decent man to be on bad terms<br>
with the court," says Cardinal de Retz.<br>
<br>
Negotiations for a general peace, the preliminaries whereof had been<br>
signed by King Louis XIII. in 1641, had been going on since 1644 at<br>
Munster and at Osnabriick, without having produced any result; the Duke<br>
of Enghien, who became Prince of  Conde in 1646, was keeping up the war<br>
in Flanders and Germany, with the co-operation of Viscount Turenne,<br>
younger brother of the Duke of Bouillon, and, since Rocroi, a marshal of<br>
France.  The capture of Thionville and of Dunkerque, the victories of<br>
Friburg and Nordlingen, the skilful opening effected in Germany as far as<br>
Augsburg by the French and the Swedes, had raised so high the reputation<br>
of the two generals, that the Prince of  Conde, who was haughty and<br>
ambitious, began to cause great umbrage to Mazarin.  Fear of having him<br>
unoccupied deterred the cardinal from peace, and made all the harder the<br>
conditions he presumed to impose upon the Spaniards.  Meanwhile the<br>
United Provinces, weary of a war which fettered their commerce, and<br>
skilfully courted by their old masters, had just concluded a private<br>
treaty with Spain; the emperor was trying, but to no purpose, to detach<br>
the Swedes likewise from the French alliance, when the victory of Lens,<br>
gained on the 20th of August, 1648, over Archduke Leopold and General<br>
Beck, came to throw into the balance the weight of a success as splendid<br>
as it was unexpected; one more campaign, and Turenne might be threatening<br>
Vienna whilst Conde entered Brussels; the emperor saw there was no help<br>
for it, and bent his head.  The house of Austria split in two; Spain<br>
still refused to treat with France, but the whole of Germany clamored for<br>
peace; the conditions of it were at last drawn up at Munster by MM.<br>
Servien and de Lionne; M. d'Avaux, the most able diplomatist that France<br>
possessed, had been recalled to Paris at the beginning of the year.  On<br>
the 24th of October, 1648, after four years of negotiation, France at<br>
last had secured to her Elsass and the three bishoprics of Metz, Toul,<br>
and Verdun; Sweden gained Western Pomerania, including Stettin, the Isle<br>
of Rugen, the three mouths of the Oder, and the bishoprics of Bremen and<br>
Werden, thus becoming a German power: as for Germany, she had won liberty<br>
of conscience and political liberty; the rights of the Lutheran or<br>
reformed Protestants were equalized with those of Catholics; henceforth<br>
the consent of a free assembly of all the Estates of the empire was<br>
necessary to make laws, raise soldiers, impose taxes, and decide peace or<br>
war.  The peace of Westphalia put an end at one and the same time to the<br>
Thirty Years' War and to the supremacy of the house of Austria in<br>
Germany.<br>
<br>
So much glory and so many military or diplomatic successes cost dear;<br>
France was crushed by imposts, and the finances were discovered to be in<br>
utter disorder; the superintendent, D'Emery, an able and experienced man,<br>
was so justly discredited that his measures were, as a foregone<br>
conclusion, unpopular; an edict laying octroi or tariff on the entry of<br>
provisions into the city of Paris irritated the burgesses, and Parliament<br>
refused to enregister it.  For some time past the Parliament, which had<br>
been kept down by the iron hand of Richelieu, had perceived that it had<br>
to do with nothing more than an able man, and not a master; it began to<br>
hold up its head again; a union was proposed between the four sovereign<br>
courts of Paris, to wit, the Parliament, the grand council, the chamber<br>
of exchequer, and the court of aids or indirect taxes; the queen quashed<br>
the deed of union; the magistrates set her at nought; the queen yielded,<br>
authorizing the delegates to deliberate in the chamber of St. Louis at<br>
the Palace of Justice; the pretensions of the Parliament were exorbitant,<br>
and aimed at nothing short of resuming, in the affairs of the state, the<br>
position from which Richelieu had deposed it; the concessions which<br>
Cardinal Mazarin with difficulty wrung from the queen augmented the<br>
Parliament's demands.  Anne of Austria was beginning to lose patience,<br>
when the news of the victory of Lens restored courage to the court.<br>
"Parliament will be very sorry," said the little king, on hearing of the<br>
Prince of Conde's success.  The grave assemblage, on the 26th of August,<br>
was issuing from Notre Dame, where a Te Deum had just been sung, when<br>
Councillor Broussel and President Blancmesnil were arrested in their<br>
houses, and taken one to St. Germain and the other to Vincennes.  This<br>
was a familiar proceeding on the part of royal authority in its<br>
disagreements with the Parliament.  Anne of Austria herself had practised<br>
it four years before.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: Arrest of Broussel----352]<br>
<br>
It was a mistake on the part of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin<br>
not to have considered the different condition of the public mind.<br>
A suppressed excitement had for some months been hatching in Paris and in<br>
the provinces.  "The Parliament growled over the tariff-edict," says<br>
Cardinal de Retz; "and no sooner had it muttered than everybody awoke.<br>
People went groping as it were after the laws; they were no longer to be<br>
found.  Under the influence of this agitation the people entered the<br>
sanctuary and lifted the veil that ought always to conceal whatever can<br>
be said about the right of peoples and that of kings, which never accord<br>
so well as in silence."  The arrest of Broussel, an old man in high<br>
esteem, very keen in his opposition to the court, was like fire to flax.<br>
"There was a blaze at once, a sensation, a rush, an outcry, and a<br>
shutting up of shops."  Paul de Gondi, known afterwards as Cardinal de<br>
Retz, was at that time coadjutor of the Archbishop of Paris, his uncle<br>
witty, debauched, bold, and restless, lately compromised in the plots of<br>
the Count of Soissons against Cardinal Richelieu, he owed his office to<br>
the queen, and "did not hesitate," he says, "to repair to her, that he<br>
might stick to his duty above all things."<br>
<br>
[Illustration: Cardinal de Retz----352]<br>
<br>
There was already a great tumult in the streets when he arrived at the<br>
Palais-Royal: the people were shouting, "Broussel!  Broussel!"  The<br>
coadjutor was accompanied by Marshal la Meilleraye; and both of them<br>
reported the excitement amongst the people.  The queen grew angry.<br>
"There is revolt in imagining that there can be revolt," she said: "these<br>
are the ridiculous stories of those who desire it; the king's authority<br>
will soon restore order."  Then, as old M. de Guitaut, who had just come<br>
in, supported the coadjutor, and said that he did not understand how<br>
anybody could sleep in the state in which things were, the cardinal asked<br>
him, with some slight irony, "Well, M. de Guitaut, and what is your<br>
advice?"  "My advice," said Guitaut, "is to give up that old rascal of a<br>
Broussel, dead or alive."  "The former," replied the coadjutor, "would<br>
not accord with either the queen's piety or her prudence; the latter<br>
might stop the tumult."  At this word the queen blushed, and exclaimed,<br>
"I understand you, Mr. Coadjutor; you would have me set Broussel at<br>
liberty.  I would strangle him with these hands first!"  "And, as she<br>
finished the last syllable, she put them close to my face," says De Retz,<br>
"adding, 'And those who .  .  .  ' The cardinal advanced and whispered in<br>
her ear."  Advices of a more and more threatening character continued to<br>
arrive; and, at last, it was resolved to promise that Broussel should be<br>
set at liberty, provided that the people dispersed and ceased to demand<br>
it tumultuously.  The coadjutor was charged to proclaim this concession<br>
throughout Paris; he asked for a regular order, but was not listened to.<br>
"The queen had retired to her little gray room.  Monsignor pushed me very<br>
gently with his two hands, saying, 'Restore the peace of the realm.'<br>
Marshal Meilleraye drew me along, and so I went out with my rochet and<br>
camail, bestowing benedictions right and left; but this occupation did<br>
not prevent me from making all the reflections suitable to the difficulty<br>
in which I found myself.  The impetuosity of Marshal Meilleraye did not<br>
give me opportunity to weigh my expressions; he advanced sword in hand,<br>
shouting with all his might, 'Hurrah for the king!  Liberation for<br>
Broussel!'  As he was seen by many more folks than heard him, he provoked<br>
with his sword far more people than he appeased with his voice."  The<br>
tumult increased; there was a rush to arms on all sides; the coadjutor<br>
was felled to the ground by a blow from a stone.  He had just picked<br>
himself up, when a burgess put his musket to his head.  "Though I did not<br>
know him a bit," says Retz, "I thought it would not be well to let him<br>
suppose so at such a moment; on the contrary, I said to him, 'Ah!<br>
wretch, if thy father saw thee!'  He thought I was the best friend of his<br>
father, on whom, however, I had never set eyes."<br>
<br>
[Illustration: "Ah, Wretch, if thy Father saw thee!"----354]<br>
<br>
The coadjutor was recognized, and the crowd pressed round him, dragging<br>
him to the market-place.  He kept repeating everywhere that "the queen<br>
promised to restore Broussel."  The fiippers laid down their arms, and<br>
thirty or forty thousand men accompanied him to the Palais-Royal.<br>
"Madame," said Marshal Meilleraye as he entered, "here is he to whom I<br>
owe my life, and your Majesty the safety of the Palais-Royal."  The queen<br>
began to smile.  "The marshal flew into a passion, and said with an oath,<br>
'Madame, no proper man can venture to flatter you in the state in which<br>
things are; and if you do not this very day set Broussel at liberty,<br>
to-morrow there will not be left one stone upon another in Paris.'  I<br>
wished to speak in support of what the marshal said, but the queen cut<br>
me short, saying, with an air of raillery, 'Go and rest yourself, sir;<br>
you have worked very hard.'"<br>
<br>
The coadjutor left the Palais-Royal "in what is called a rage;" and he<br>
was in a greater one in the evening, when his friends came and told him<br>
that he was being made fun of at the queen's supper-table; that she was<br>
convinced that he had done all he could to increase the tumult; that he<br>
would be the first to be made a great example of; and that the Parliament<br>
was about to be interdicted.  Paul de Gondi had not waited for their<br>
information to think of revolt.  "I did not reflect as to what I could<br>
do," says he, "for I was quite certain of that; I reflected only as to<br>
what I ought to do, and I was perplexed."  The jests and the threats of<br>
the court appeared to him to be sufficient justification.  "What<br>
effectually stopped my scruples was the advantage I imagined I had in<br>
distinguishing myself from those of my profession by a state of life in<br>
which there was something of all professions.  In disorderly times,<br>
things lead to a confusion of species, and the vices of an archbishop<br>
may, in an infinity of conjunctures, be the virtues of a party leader."<br>
The coadjutor recalled his friends.  "We are not in such bad case as you<br>
supposed, gentlemen," he said to them; "there is an intention of crushing<br>
the public; it is for me to defend it from oppression; to-morrow before<br>
midday I shall be master of Paris."<br>
<br>
For some time past the coadjutor had been laboring to make himself<br>
popular in Paris; the general excitement was only waiting to break out,<br>
and when the chancellor's carriage appeared in the streets in the<br>
morning, on the way to the Palace of Justice, the people, secretly worked<br>
upon during the night, all at once took up arms again.  The chancellor<br>
had scarcely time to seek refuge in the Hotel de Luynes; the mob rushed<br>
in after him, pillaging and destroying the furniture, whilst the<br>
chancellor, flying for refuge into a small chamber, and believing his<br>
last hour had come, was confessing to his brother, the Bishop of Meaux.<br>
He was not discovered, and the crowd moved off in another direction.  "It<br>
was like a sudden and violent conflagration lighted up from the Pont Neuf<br>
over the whole city.  Everybody without exception took up arms.  Children<br>
of five and six years of age were seen dagger in hand; and the mothers<br>
themselves carried them.  In less than two hours there were in Paris more<br>
than two hundred barricades, bordered with flags and all the arms that<br>
the League had left entire.  Everybody cried, 'Hurrah! for the king!' but<br>
echo answered, 'None of your Mazarin!'"<br>
<br>
The coadjutor kept himself shut up at home, protesting his powerlessness;<br>
the Parliament had met at an early hour; the Palace of Justice was<br>
surrounded by an immense crowd, shouting, "Broussel!  Broussel!"  The<br>
Parliament resolved to go in a body and demand of the queen the release<br>
of their members arrested the day before.  "We set out in full court,"<br>
says the premier president Mole, "without sending, as the custom is, to<br>
ask the queen to appoint a time, the ushers in front, with their square<br>
caps and a-foot: from this spot as far as the Trahoir cross we found the<br>
people in arms and barricades thrown up at every hundred paces."<br>

[Illustration: President Mole----355]<br>
<br>
"If it were not blasphemy to say that there was any one in our age more<br>
intrepid than the great Gustavus and the Prince, I should say it was M.<br>
Mole, premier president," writes Cardinal de Retz.  Sincerely devoted to<br>
the public weal, and a magistrate to the very bottom of his soul, Mole,<br>
nevertheless, inclined towards the side of power, and understood better<br>
than his brethren the danger of factions.  He represented to the queen<br>
the extreme danger the sedition was causing to Paris and to France.<br>
"She, who feared nothing because she knew but little, flew into a passion<br>
and answered, furiously, 'I am quite aware that there is disturbance in<br>
the city, but you shall answer to me for it, gentlemen of the Parliament,<br>
you, your wives, and your children.'"  "The queen was pleased," says<br>
Mole, in his dignified language, "to signify in terms of wrath that the<br>
magisterial body should be answerable for the evils which might ensue,<br>
and which the king on reaching his majority would remember."<br>
<br>
The queen had retired to her room, slamming the door violently; the<br>
Parliament turned back to the Palace of Justice; the angry mob thronged<br>
about the magistrates; when they arrived at Rue St. Honore, just as they<br>
were about to turn on to the Pont Neuf, a band of armed men fell upon<br>
them, "and a cookshop-lad, advancing at the head of two hundred men,<br>
thrust his halbert against the premier president's stomach, saying,<br>
'Turn, traitor, and, if thou wouldst not thyself be slain, give up to us<br>
Broussel, or Mazarin and the chancellor as hostages.'"  Matthew Mole<br>
quietly put the weapon aside, and, "You forget yourself," he said, "and<br>
are oblivious of the respect you owe to my office."  "Thrice an effort<br>
was made.to thrust me into a private house," says his account in his<br>
Memoires, "but I still kept my place; and, attempts having been made with<br>
swords and pistols on all sides of me to make an end of me, God would not<br>
permit it, some of the members (Messieurs) and some true friends having<br>
placed themselves in front of me.  I told President de Mesmes that there<br>
was no other plan but to return to the Palais-Royal and thither take back<br>
the body, which was much diminished in numbers, five of the presidents<br>
having dropped away, and also many of the members on whom the people had<br>
inflicted unworthy treatment."  "Thus having given himself time to rally<br>
as many as he could of the body, and still preserving the dignity of the<br>
magistracy both in his words and in his movements, the premier president<br>
returned at a slow pace to the Palais-Royal, amidst a running fire of<br>
insults, threats, execrations, and blasphemies."  [_Memoires de Retz._]<br>
<br>
The whole court had assembled in the gallery: Mole spoke first.  "This<br>
man," says Retz, "had a sort of eloquence peculiar to himself.  He knew<br>
nothing of apostrophes, he was not correct in his language, but he spoke<br>
with a force which made up for all that, and he was naturally so bold<br>
that he never spoke so well as in the midst of peril.  Monsieur made as<br>
if he would throw himself on his knees before the queen, who remained<br>
inflexible; four or five princesses, who were trembling with fear, did<br>
throw themselves at her feet; the Queen of England, who had come that day<br>
from St. Germain, represented that the troubles had never been so serious<br>
at their commencement in England, nor the feelings so heated or united."<br>
[_Histoire du Temps,_ 1647-48.  (_Archives curieuses,_ vi. p. 162.)]  At<br>
last the cardinal made up his mind; he "had been roughly handled in the<br>
queen's presence by the presidents and councillors in their speeches,<br>
some of them telling him, in mockery, that he had only to give himself<br>
the trouble of going as far as the Pont Neuf to see for himself the state<br>
in which things were," and he joined with all those present in entreating<br>
Anne of Austria; finally, the release of Broussel was extorted from her,<br>
"not without a deep sigh, which showed what violence she did her feelings<br>
in the struggle."<br>
<br>
"We returned in full court by the same road," says Matthew Mole, "and the<br>
people demanding, with confused clamor of voices, whether M. Broussel<br>
were at liberty, we gave them assurances thereof, and entered by the<br>
back-door of my lodging; before crossing the threshold, I took leave of<br>
Presidents De Mesmes and Le Coigneux, and waited until the members had<br>
passed, testifying my sentiments of gratitude for that they had been<br>
unwilling to separate until they had seen to the security of my person,<br>
which I had not at all deserved, but such was their good pleasure.  After<br>
this business, which had lasted from six in the morning until seven<br>
o'clock, there was need of rest, seeing that the mind had been agitated<br>
amidst so many incidents, and not a morsel had been tasted."  [_Memoires<br>
de Matthieu Mole,_ t. iii.  p. 265.]<br>
<br>
Broussel had taken his seat in the Parliament again.  The Prince of Conde<br>
had just arrived in Paris; he did not like the cardinal, but he was angry<br>
with the Parliament, which he considered imprudent and insolent.  "They<br>
are going ahead," said he:--"if I were to go ahead with them, I should<br>
perhaps do better for my own interests, but my name is Louis de Bourbon,<br>
and I do not wish to shake the throne; these devils of squarecaps, are<br>
they mad about bringing me either to commence a civil war before long, or<br>
to put a rope round their own necks, and place over their heads and over<br>
my own an adventurer from Sicily, who will be the ruin of us all in the<br>
end?  I will let the Parliament plainly see that they are not where they<br>
suppose, and that it would not be a hard matter to bring them to reason."<br>
The coadjutor, to whom he thus expressed himself, answered that "the<br>
cardinal might possibly be mistaken in his measures, and that Paris would<br>
be a hard nut to crack."  Whereupon the prince rejoined, angrily, "It<br>
will not be taken, like Dunkerque, by mining and assaults, but if the<br>
bread of Gonesse were to fail them for a week .  .  ."  The coadjutor<br>
took the rest as said.  Some days afterwards, during the night between<br>
the 5th and 6th of January, 1649, the queen, with the little king and the<br>
whole court, set out at four A. M. from Paris for the castle of St.<br>
Germain, empty, unfurnished, as was then the custom in the king's<br>
absence, where the courtiers had great difficulty in finding a bundle of<br>
straw.  "The queen had scarcely a bed to lie upon," says Mdlle. de<br>
Montpensier, "but never did I see any creature so gay as she was that<br>
day; had she won a battle, taken Paris, and had all who had displeased<br>
her hanged, she could not have been more so, and nevertheless she was<br>
very far from all that."<br>
<br>
Paris was left to the malcontents; everybody was singing,<br>
<br>
               "A Fronde-ly wind<br>
                Got up to-day,<br>
               'Gainst Mazarin<br>
                It howls, they say."<br>
<br>
On the 8th of January the Parliament of Paris, all the chambers in<br>
assembly, issued a decree whereby Cardinal Mazarin was declared an enemy<br>
to the king and the state, and a disturber of the public peace, and<br>
injunctions were laid upon all subjects of the king to hunt him down; war<br>
was declared.<br>
<br>
Scarcely had it begun, when the greatest lords came flocking to the<br>
popular side.  On the departure of the court for St. Germain, the Duchess<br>
of Longueville had remained in Paris; her husband and her brother the<br>
Prince of Conti were not slow in coming to look after her; and already<br>
the Duke of Elbeuf, of the house of Lorraine, had offered his services to<br>
the Parliament.  Levies of troops were beginning in the city, and the<br>
command of the forces was offered to the Prince of Conti; the Dukes of<br>
Bouillon and Beaufort and Marshal de la Mothe likewise embraced the party<br>
of revolt; the Duchesses of Longueville and Bouillon established<br>
themselves with their children at the Hotel de Ville as hostages given by<br>
the Fronde of princes to the Fronde of the people; the Parliaments of Aix<br>
and Rouen made common cause with that of Paris; a decree ordered the<br>
seizure, in all the exchequers of the kingdom, of the royal moneys, in<br>
order that they might be employed for the general defence.  Every evening<br>
Paris wore a festive air; there was dancing at the Hotel de Ville, and<br>
the gentlemen who had been skirmishing during the day around the walls<br>
came for recreation in the society of the princesses.  "This commingling<br>
of blue scarfs, of ladies, of cuirasses, of violins in the hall, and of<br>
trumpets in the square, offered a spectacle which is oftener seen in<br>
romances than elsewhere."  [_Memoires du Cardinal de Retz,_ t. i.]<br>
Affairs of gallantry were mixed up with the most serious resolves; Madame<br>
de Longueville was of the Fronde because she was in love with M. de<br>
Marsillac (afterwards Duke of La Rochefoucauld), and he was on bad terms<br>
with Cardinal Mazarin.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile war was rumbling round Paris; the post of Charenton, fortified<br>
by the Frondeurs, had been carried by the Prince of Conde at the head of<br>
the king's troops; the Parliament was beginning to perceive its mistake,<br>
and desired to have peace again, but the great lords engaged in the<br>
contest aspired to turn it to account; they had already caused the gates<br>
of Paris to be closed against a herald sent by the queen to recall her<br>
subjects to their duty; they were awaiting the army of Germany, commanded<br>
by M. de Tnrenne, whom his brother, the Duke of Bouillon, had drawn into<br>
his culpable enterprise; nay, more, they had begun to negotiate with<br>
Spain, and they brought up to the Parliament a pretended envoy from<br>
Archduke Leopold, but the court refused to receive him.  "What! sir,"<br>
said President de Mesmes, turning to the Prince of Conti, "is it possible<br>
that a prince of the blood of France should propose to give a seat upon<br>
the fleurs-de-lis to a deputy from the most cruel enemy of the<br>
fleurs-de-lis?"<br>
<br>
The Parliament sent a deputation to the queen, and conferences were<br>
opened at Ruel on the 4th of March;.  the great lords of the Fronde took<br>
no part in it; "they contented themselves with having at St. Germain<br>
low-voiced (a basses notes)--secret agents," says Madame de Motteville,<br>
"commissioned to negotiate in their favor."  Paris was beginning to lack<br>
bread; it was festival-time, and want began to make itself felt; a<br>
"complaint of the Carnival" was current amongst the people:--<br>
<br>
               "In my extreme affliction, yet<br>
               I can this consolation get,<br>
               That, at his hands, my enemy,<br>
               Old Lent, will fare the same as I:<br>
               That, at the times when people eat,<br>
               We both shall equal worship meet.<br>
               Thus, joining with the whole of France<br>
               In war against him _a outrance,_<br>
               Grim Lent and festive Carnival,<br>
               Will fight against the cardinal."<br>
<br>
It was against the cardinal, in fact, that all attacks were directed, but<br>
the queen remained immovable in her fidelity.  "I should be afraid," she<br>
said to Madame de Motteville, "that, if I were to let him fall, the same<br>
thing would happen to me that happened to the King of England (Charles I.<br>
had just been executed), and that, after he had been driven out, my turn<br>
would come."  Grain had found its way into Paris during the truce; and<br>
when, on the 13th of March, the premier president, Molt;, and the other<br>
negotiators, returned to Paris, bringing the peace which they had signed<br>
at Ruel, they were greeted with furious shouts: "None of your peace!<br>
None of your Mazarin!  We must go to St.  Germain to seek our good king!<br>
We must fling into the river all the Mazarins!"  A rioter had just laid<br>
his hand on the premier president's arm.  "When you have killed me," said<br>
the latter, calmly, "I shall only want six feet of earth;" and, when he<br>
was advised to get back into his house by way of the record-offices, "The<br>
court never hides itself," he said; "if I were certain to perish, I would<br>
not commit this poltroonery, which, moreover, would but serve to give<br>
courage to the rioters.  They would, of course, come after me to my house<br>
if they thought that I shrank from them here."  The deputies of the<br>
Parliament were sent back to Ruel, taking a statement of the claims of<br>
the great lords: "according to their memorials, they demanded the whole<br>
of France."  [_Memoires de Madame de Motteville,_ t. iii.  p. 247.]<br>
<br>
Whilst Paris was in disorder, and the agitation, through its example, was<br>
spreading over almost the whole of France, M. de Turenne, obliged to fly<br>
from his army, was taking refuge, he and five others, with the landgrave<br>
of Hesse; his troops had refused to follow him in revolt; the last hope<br>
of the Frondeurs was slipping from them.<br>
<br>
They found themselves obliged to accept peace, not without obtaining some<br>
favors from the court.<br>
<br>
There was a general amnesty; and the Parliament preserved all its rights.<br>
"The king will have the honor of it, and we the profit," said Guy-Patin.<br>
The great lords reappeared one after another at St. Germain.  "It is the<br>
way of our nation to return to their duty with the same airiness with<br>
which they depart from it, and to pass in a single instant from rebellion<br>
to obedience."  [_La Rochefoucauld._]  The return to rebellion was not to<br>
be long delayed.  The queen had gone back to Paris, and the Prince of<br>
Conde with her; he, proud of having beaten the parliamentary Fronde,<br>
affected the conqueror's airs, and the throng of his courtiers, the<br>
"petits maitres," as they were called, spoke very slightingly of the<br>
cardinal.   Conde, reconciled with the Duchess of Longueville, his<br>
sister, and his brother, the Prince of Conti, assumed to have the lion's<br>
share in the government, and claimed all the favors for himself or his<br>
friends; the Fondeurs made skilful use of the ill-humor which this<br>
conduct excited in Cardinal Mazarin; the minister responded to their<br>
advances; the coadjutor was secretly summoned to the Louvre; the dowager<br>
Princess of  Conde felt some apprehensions; but, "What have I to fear?"<br>
her son said to her; "the cardinal is my friend."  "I doubt it," she<br>
answered.  "You are wrong; I rely upon him as much as upon you."  "Please<br>
God you may not be mistaken!" replied the princess, who was setting out<br>
for the Palais-Royal to see the queen, said to be indisposed that day.<br>
<br>
Anne of Austria was upon her bed; word was brought to her that the<br>
council was waiting; this was the moment agreed upon; she dismissed the<br>
princess, shut herself up in her oratory with the little king, to whom<br>
she gave an account of what was going to be done for his service; then,<br>
making him kneel down, she joined him in praying to God for the success<br>
of this great enterprise.  As the Prince of  Conde arrived in the grand<br>
gallery, he saw Guitaut, captain of the guards, coming towards him; at<br>
the same instant, through a door at the bottom, out went the cardinal,<br>
taking with him Abbe de la Riviere, who was the usual confidant of the<br>
Duke of Orleans, but from whom his master had concealed the great secret.<br>
The prince supppsed that Guitaut was coming to ask him some favor; the<br>
captain of the guards said in his ear, "My lord, what I want to say is,<br>
that I have orders to arrest you, you, the Prince of Conti your brother,<br>
and M. de Longueville."  "Me, M. Guitaut, arrest me?"  Then, reflecting<br>
for a moment, "In God's name," he said, "go back to the queen and tell<br>
her that I entreat her to let me have speech of her!"  Guitaut went to<br>
her, whilst the prince, returning to those who were waiting for him,<br>
said, "Gentlemen, the queen orders my arrest, and yours too, brother, and<br>
yours too, M. de Longueville; I confess that I am astonished, I who have<br>
always served the king so well, and believed myself secure of the<br>
cardinal's friendship."  The chancellor, who was not in the secret,<br>
declared that it was Guitaut's pleasantry.  "Go and seek the queen then,"<br>
said the prince, "and tell her of the pleasantry that is going on; as for<br>
me, I hold it to be very certain that I am arrested."  The chancellor<br>
went out, and did not return.  M. Servien, who had gone to speak to the<br>
cardinal, likewise did not appear again.  M. de Guitaut entered alone.<br>
"The queen cannot see you, my lord," he said.  "Very well; I am content;<br>
let us obey," answered the prince: "but whither are you going to take us?<br>
I pray you let it be to a warm place."  "We are going to the wood of<br>
Vincennes, my lord," said Guitaut.  The prince turned to the company and<br>
took his leave without uneasiness and with the calmest countenance: as he<br>
was embracing M. de Brienne, secretary of state, he said to him, "Sir, as<br>
I have often received from you marks of your friendship and generosity, I<br>
flatter myself that you will some day tell the king the services I have<br>
rendered him."  The princes went out; and, as they descended the<br>
staircase, Conde leaned towards Comminges, who commanded the detachment<br>
of guards, saying, "Comminges, you are a man of honor and a gentleman;<br>
have I anything to fear?"  Comminges assured him he had not, and that the<br>
orders were merely to escort him to the wood of Vincennes. The carriage<br>
upset on the way; as soon as it was righted, Comminges ordered the driver<br>
to urge on his horses.  The prince burst out laughing.  "Don't be afraid,<br>
Comminges," he said; "there is nobody to come to my assistance; I swear<br>
to you that I had not taken any precautions against this trip."  On<br>
arriving at the castle of Vincennes, there were no beds to be found, and<br>
the three princes passed the night playing at cards; the Princess of<br>
Conde and the dowager princess received orders to retire to their<br>
estates; the Duchess of Longueville, fearing with good cause that she<br>
would be arrested, had taken with all speed the road to Normandy, whither<br>
she went and took refuge at Dieppe, in her husband's government.<br>
<br>
The state-stroke had succeeded; Mazarin's skill and prudence once more<br>
check-mated all the intrigues concocted against him; when the news was<br>
told to Chavigny, in spite of all his reasons for bearing malice against<br>
the cardinal, who had driven him from the council and kept him for some<br>
time in prison, he exclaimed, "That is a great misfortune for the prince<br>
and his friends; but the truth must be told: the cardinal has done quite<br>
right; without it he would have been ruined."  The contest was begun<br>
between Mazarin and the great Conde, and it was not with the prince that<br>
the victory was to remain.<br>
<br>
Already hostilities were commencing; Mazarin had done everything for the<br>
Frondeurs who remained faithful to him, but the house of Conde was<br>
rallying all its partisans; the Dukes of Bouillon and La Rochefoucauld<br>
had thrown themselves into Bordeaux, which was in revolt against the<br>
royal authority, represented by the Duke of Epernon.  The Princess of<br>
Conde and her young son left Chantilly to join them; Madame de<br>
Longueville occupied Stenay, a strong place belonging to the Prince of<br>
Conde: she had there found Turenne; on the other hand, the queen had just<br>
been through Normandy; all the towns had opened their gates to her; it<br>
was just the same in Burgundy; the Princess of Conde's able agent, Lenet,<br>
could not obtain a declaration from the Parliament of Dijon in her favor.<br>
Bordeaux was the focus of the insurrection; the people, passionately<br>
devoted to "the dukes," as the saying was, were forcing the hand of the<br>
Parliament; riots were frequent in the town; the little king, with the<br>
queen and the cardinal, marched in person upon Bordeaux; one of the<br>
faubourgs was attacked, the dukes negotiated and obtained a general<br>
amnesty, but no mention was made of the princes' release.<br>
<br>
The Parliament of Paris took the matter up.  The premier president spoke<br>
in so bitter a tone of the unhappy policy of the minister, that the<br>
little king, feeling hurt, told his mother that, if he had thought it<br>
would not displease her, he would have made the premier president hold<br>
his tongue, and would have dismissed him.  On the 30th of January, Anne<br>
of Austria sent word to the Parliament that she would consent to grant<br>
the release of the princes, "provided that the armaments of Stenay and of<br>
M. de Turenne might be discontinued."  But it was too late; the Duke of<br>
Orleans had made a treaty with the princes.  England served as pretext.<br>
Mazarin compared the Parliament to the House of Commons, and the<br>
coadjutor to Cromwell.  Monsieur took the matter up for his friends, and<br>
was angry.  He openly declared that he would not set foot again in the<br>
Palais-Royal as long as he was liable to meet the cardinal there, and<br>
joined the Parliament in demanding the removal of Mazarin.  The queen<br>
replied that nobody had a right to interfere in the choice of ministers.<br>
By way of answer, the Parliament laid injunctions upon all the officers<br>
of the crown to obey none but the Duke of Orleans, lieutenant general of<br>
the kingdom.  A meeting of the noblesse, at a tumultuous assembly in the<br>
house of the Duke of Nemours, expressed themselves in the same sense.  It<br>
was the 6th of February, 1651: during the night, Cardinal Mazarin set out<br>
for St. Germain; a rumor spread in Paris that the queen was preparing to<br>
follow him with the king; a rush was made to the Palais-Royal: the king<br>
was in his bed.  Next day, Anne of Austria complained to the Parliament.<br>
"The prince is at liberty," said the premier president, "and the king,<br>
the king our master, is a prisoner."  "Monsieur, who felt no fear," says<br>
Retz, "because he had been more cheered in the streets and the hall of<br>
the palace than he had ever been," answered with vivacity, "The king was<br>
a prisoner in the hands of Mazarin; but, thank God, he is not any<br>
longer."  The premier president was right; the king was a prisoner to the<br>
Parisians; patrols of burgesses were moving incessantly round the Palais-<br>
Royal; one night the queen was obliged to let the people into her<br>
chamber; the king was asleep; and two officers of the town-guard watched<br>
for some hours at his pillow.  The yoke of Richelieu and the omnipotence<br>
of Mazarin were less hard for royalty to bear than the capricious and<br>
jealous tyranny of the populace.<br>
<br>
The cardinal saw that he was beaten; he made up his mind, and,<br>
anticipating the queen's officers, he hurried to Le Havre to release the<br>
prisoners himself; he entered the castle alone, the governor having<br>
refused entrance to the guards who attended him.  "The prince told me,"<br>
says Mdlle. de Montpensier, "that, when they were dining together,<br>
Cardinal Mazarin was not so much in the humor to laugh as he himself was,<br>
and that he was very much embarrassed.  Liberty to be gone had more<br>
charms for the prince than the cardinal's company.  He said that he felt<br>
marvellous delight at finding himself outside Le Havre, with his sword at<br>
his side; and he might well be pleased to wear it; he is a pretty good<br>
hand at using it.  As he went out he turned to the cardinal and said,<br>
'Farewell, Cardinal Mazarin,' who kissed 'the tip of sleeve' to him."<br>
<br>
The cardinal had slowly taken the road to exile, summoning to him his<br>
nieces, Mdlles. Mancini and Martinozzi, whom he had, a short time since,<br>
sent for to court; he crossed from Normandy into Picardy, made some stay<br>
at Doullens, and, impelled by his enemies' hatred, he finally crossed the<br>
frontier on the 12th of March.  The Parliament had just issued orders for<br>
his arrest in any part of France.  On the 6th of April, he fixed his<br>
quarters at Bruhl, a little town belonging to the electorate of Cologne,<br>
in the same territory which had but lately sheltered the last days of<br>
Mary de' Medici.<br>
<br>
The Frondeurs, old and new, had gained the day; but even now there was<br>
disorder in their camp.  Conde had returned to the court "like a raging<br>
lion, seeking to devour everybody, and, in revenge for his imprisonment,<br>
to set fire to the four corners of the realm."  [_Memoires de Montglat._]<br>
After a moment's reconciliation with the queen, be began to show himself<br>
more and more haughty towards her in his demands every day; he required<br>
the dismissal of the ministers Le Tellier, Servien, and Lionne, all three<br>
creatures of the cardinal and in correspondence with him at Bruhl; as<br>
Anne of Austria refused, the prince retired to St. Maur; he was already<br>
in negotiation with Spain, being inveigled into treason by the influence<br>
of his sister, Madame de Longueville, who would not leave the Duke of<br>
La Rochefoucauld or return into Normandy to her husband.  Fatal results<br>
of a guilty passion which enlisted against his country the arms of the<br>
hero of Rocroi!  When he returned to Paris, the queen had, in fact,<br>
dismissed her ministers, but she had formed a fresh alliance with the<br>
coadjutor, and, on the 17th of August, in the presence of an assembly<br>
convoked for that purpose at the Palais-Royal, she openly denounced the<br>
intrigues of the prince with Spain, accusing him of being in<br>
correspondence with the archduke.  Next day Conde brought the matter<br>
before the Parliament.  The coadjutor quite expected the struggle, and<br>
had brought supporters; the queen had sent some soldiers; the prince<br>
arrived with a numerous attendance.  On entering, he said to the company,<br>
that he could not sufficiently express his astonishment at the condition<br>
in which he found the palace, which seemed to him more like a camp than a<br>
temple of justice, and that it was not merely that there could be found<br>
in the kingdom people insolent enough to presume to dispute (superiority)<br>
the pavement (disputer le pave) with him.  "I made him a deep obeisance,"<br>
says Retz, "and said that, I very humbly begged his Highness to pardon me<br>
if I told him that I did not believe that there was anybody in the<br>
kingdom insolent enough to dispute the wall (le haut du pave) with him,<br>
but I was persuaded that there were some who could not and ought not, for<br>
their dignity's sake, to yield the pavement (quitter le pave) to any but<br>
the king.  The prince replied that he would make me yield it.  I said<br>
that that would not be easy."  The dispute grew warm; the presidents<br>
flung themselves between the disputants; Conde yielded to their<br>
entreaties, and begged the Duke of La Rochefoucauld to go and tell his<br>
friends to withdraw.  The coadjutor went out to make the same request to<br>
his friends.  "When he would have returned into the usher's little<br>
court," writes Mdlle. de Montpensier, "he met at the door the Duke of La<br>
Rochefoucauld, who shut it in his face, just keeping it ajar to see who<br>
accompanied the coadjutor; he, seeing the door ajar, gave it a good push,<br>
but he could not pass quite through, and remained as it were jammed<br>
between the two folds, unable to get in or out.  The Duke of La<br>
Rochefoucauld had fastened the door with an iron catch, keeping it so to<br>
prevent its opening any wider.  The coadjutor was 'in an ugly position,<br>
for he could not help fearing lest a dagger should pop out and take his<br>
life from behind.  A complaint was made to the grand chamber, and<br>
Champlatreux, son of the premier president, went out, and, by his<br>
authority, had the door opened, in spite of the Duke of La<br>
Rochefoucauld."  The coadjutor protested, and the Duke of Brissac, his<br>
relative, threatened the Duke of La Rochefoucauld; whereupon the latter<br>
said that, if he had them outside, he would strangle them both; to which<br>
the coadjutor replied, "My dear La Franchise (the duke's nickname), do<br>
not act the bully; you are a poltroon and I am a priest; we shall not do<br>
one another much harm."  There was no fighting, and the Parliament,<br>
supported by the Duke of Orleans, obtained from the queen a declaration<br>
of the innocence of the Prince of Conde, and at the same time a formal<br>
disavowal of Mazarin's policy, and a promise never to recall him.  Anne<br>
of Austria yielded everything; the king's majority was approaching, and<br>
she flattered herself that under cover of his name she would be able to<br>
withdraw the concessions which she felt obliged to make as regent.  Her<br>
declaration, nevertheless, deeply wounded Mazarin, who was still taking<br>
refuge at Bruhl, whence he wrote incessantly to the queen, who did not<br>
neglect his counsels.  "Ten times I have taken up my pen to write to<br>
you," he said on the 26th of September, 1651 [_Lettres du Cardinal<br>
Mazarin a la Reine,_ pp. 292, 293], "but could not, and I am so beside<br>
myself at the mortal wound I have just received, that I am not sure<br>
whether anything I could say to you would have rhyme or reason.  The king<br>
and the queen, by an authentic deed, have declared me a traitor, a public<br>
robber, an incapable, and an enemy to the repose of Christendom, after I<br>
had served them with so many signs of my devotion to the advancement of<br>
peace: it is no longer a question of property, repose, or whatever else<br>
there may be of the sort.  I demand the honor which has been taken from<br>
me, and that I be let alone, renouncing very heartily the cardinalate and<br>
the benefices, whereof I send in my resignation joyfully, consenting<br>
willingly to have given up to France twenty-three years of the best of my<br>
life, all my pains and my little of wealth, and merely to withdraw with<br>
the honor which I had when I began to serve her."  The persistent hopes<br>
of the adroit Italian appeared once more in the postscript of the letter:<br>
"I had forgotten to tell you that it was not the way to set me right in<br>
the eyes of the people to impress upon their mind that I am the cause of<br>
all the evils they suffer, and of all the disorders of the realm, in such<br>
sort that my ministry will be held in horror forever."<br>
<br>
Conde did not permit himself to be caught by the queen's declarations:<br>
of all the princes he alone was missing at the ceremony of the bed of<br>
justice whereat the youthful Louis XIV., when entering his fourteenth<br>
year, announced, on the 7th of September, to his people that, according<br>
the laws of his realm, he "intended himself to assume the government,<br>
hoping of God's goodness that it would be with piety and justice."  The<br>
prince had retired to Chantilly, on the pretext that the new minister,<br>
the president of the council, Chateauneuf, and the keeper of the seals,<br>
Matthew Mole, were not friends of his.  The Duchess of Longueville at<br>
last carried the day; Conde was resolved upon civil war.  "You would have<br>
it," he said to his sister on repelling the envoy, who had followed him<br>
to Bourges, from the queen and the Duke of Orleans; "remember that I draw<br>
the sword in spite of myself, but I will be the last to sheathe it."  And<br>
he kept his word.<br>
<br>
A great disappointment awaited the rebels; they had counted upon the Duke<br>
of Bouillon and M. de Turenne, but neither of them would join the<br>
faction.  The relations between the two great generals had not been<br>
without rubs; Turenne had, moreover, felt some remorse because he, being<br>
a general in the king's army, had but lately declared against the court,<br>
"doing thereby a deed at which Le Balafro and Admiral de Coligny would<br>
have hesitated," says Cardinal de Retz.  The two brothers went, before<br>
long, and offered their services to the queen.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Conde had arrived at Bordeaux: a part of Guienne, Saintonge,<br>
and Porigord had declared in his favor; Count d'Harcourt, at the head of<br>
the royal troops, marched against La Rochelle, which he took from the<br>
revolters under the very beard of the prince, who had come from Bordeaux<br>
to the assistance of the place, whilst the king and the queen, resolutely<br>
quitting Paris, advanced from town to town as far as Poitiers, keeping<br>
the centre of France to its allegiance by their mere presence.  The<br>
treaty of the Prince of Conde with Spain was concluded: eight Spanish<br>
vessels, having money and troops on board, entered the Gironde.  Conde<br>
delivered over to them the castle and harbor of Talmont.  The queen had<br>
commissioned the cardinal to raise levies in Germany, and he had already<br>
entered the country of Liege, embodying troops and forming alliances.  On<br>
the 17th of November, Anne of Austria finally wrote to Mazarin to return<br>
to the king's assistance.  In the presence of Conde's rebellion she had<br>
no more appearances to keep up with anybody; and it was already in the<br>
master's tone that Mazarin wrote to the queen, on the 30th of October, to<br>
put her on her guard against the Duke of Orleans: "The power committed to<br>
his Royal Highness and the neutrality permitted to him, being as he is<br>
wholly devoted to the prince, surrounded by his partisans, and adhering<br>
blindly to their counsels, are matters highly prejudicial to the king's<br>
service, and, for my part, I do not see how one can be a servant of the<br>
king's, with ever so little judgment and knowledge of affairs, and yet<br>
dispute these truths.  The queen, then, must bide her time to remedy all<br>
this."<br>
<br>
The cardinal's penetration had not deceived him; the Duke of Orleans was<br>
working away in Paris, where the queen had been obliged to leave him, on<br>
the Prince of Conde's side.  The Parliament had assembled to enregister<br>
against the princes the proclamation of high treason despatched from<br>
Bourges by the court; Gaston demanded that it should be sent back,<br>
threatened as they were, he said, with a still greater danger than the<br>
rebellion of the princes in the return of Mazarin, who was even now<br>
advancing to the frontier; but the premier president took no notice, and<br>
put the proclamation to the vote in these words "It is a great misfortune<br>
when princes of the blood give occasion for such proclamations, but this<br>
is a common and ordinary misfortune in the kingdom, and, for five or six<br>
centuries past, it may be said that they have been the scourges of the<br>
people and the enemies of the monarchy."  The decree passed by a hundred<br>
votes to forty.<br>
<br>
On the 24th of December, the cardinal crossed the frontier with a large<br>
body of troops, and was received at Sedan by Lieutenant General Fabert,<br>
faithful to his fortunes even in exile.  The Parliament was furious,<br>
and voted, almost unanimously, that the cardinal and his adherents were<br>
guilty of high treason; ordering the communes to hound him down, and<br>
promising, from the proceeds of his furniture and library which were<br>
about to be sold, a sum of five hundred thousand livres to whoever should<br>
take him dead or alive.  At once began the sale of the magnificent<br>
library which the cardinal had liberally opened to the public.  The<br>
dispersion of the books was happily stopped in time to still leave a<br>
nucleus for the Mazarin Library.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Mazarin had not allowed himself to be frightened by<br>
parliamentary decrees or by dread of assassins.  Re-entering France with<br>
six thousand men, he forced the passage of Pontsur-Yonne, in spite of the<br>
two councillors of the Parliaments who were commissioned to have him<br>
arrested; the Duke of Beaufort, at the head of Monsieur's troops, did not<br>
even attempt to impede his march; and, on the 28th of January, the<br>
cardinal entered Poitiers, at once resuming his place beside the king,<br>
who had come to meet him a league from the town.  The court took<br>
leisurely the road to Paris.<br>
<br>
The coadjutor had received the price of his services in the royal cause;<br>
he was a cardinal "sooner," said he, "than Mazarias would have had him;"<br>
and so the new prince of the church considered himself released from any<br>
gratitude to the court, and sought to form a third party, at the head of<br>
which was to be placed the Duke of Orleans as nominal head.  Monsieur,<br>
harried by intrigues in all directions, remained in a state of inaction,<br>
and made a pretension of keeping Paris neutral; his daughter, Mdlle. de<br>
Montpensier, who detested Anne of Austria and Mazarin, and would have<br>
liked to marry the king, had boldly taken the side of the princes; the<br>
court had just arrived at Blois, on the 27th of March, 1652; the keeper<br>
of the seals, Mole, presented himself in front of Orleans to summon the<br>
town to open its gates to the king; at that very moment arrived Mdlle.,<br>
the great Mdlle., as she was then called; and she claimed possession of<br>
Orleans in her father's name.  "It was the appanage of Monsieur; but the<br>
gates were shut and barricaded.  After they had been told that it was I,"<br>
writes Mdlle., "they did not open; and I was there three hours.  The<br>
governor sent me some sweetmeats, and what appeared to me rather funny<br>
was that he gave me to understand that he had no influence.  At the<br>
window of the sentry-box was the Marquis d'Halluys, who watched me<br>
walking up and down by the fosse.  The rampart was fringed with people<br>
who shouted incessantly, 'Hurrah for the king! hurrah for the princes!<br>
None of your Mazarin!'  I could not help calling out to them, 'Go to the<br>
Hotel de Ville and get the gate opened to me!'  The captain made signs<br>
that he had not the keys.  I said to him, 'It must be burst open, and you<br>
owe me more allegiance than to the gentlemen of the town, seeing that I<br>
am your master's daughter.'  The boatmen offered to break open for me a<br>
gate which was close by there.  I told them to make haste, and I mounted<br>
upon a pretty high mound of earth overlooking that gate.  I thought but<br>
little about any nice way of getting thither; I climbed like a cat; I<br>
held on to briers and thorns, and I leapt all the hedges without hurting<br>
myself at all; two boats were brought up to serve me for a bridge, and in<br>
the second was placed a ladder by which I mounted.  The gate was burst at<br>
last.  Two planks had been forced out of the middle; signs were made to<br>
me to advance; and as there was a great deal of mud, a footman took me<br>
up, carried me along, and put me through this hole, through which I had<br>
no sooner passed my head than the drums began beating.  I gave my hand to<br>
the captain, and said to him, "You will be very glad that you can boast<br>
of having managed to get me in."<br>
<br>
[Illustration: The Great Mademoiselle----373]<br>
<br>
The keeper of the seals was obliged to return to Blois, and Mdlle. kept<br>
Orleans, but without being able to effect an entrance for the troops of<br>
the Dukes of Nemours and Beaufort, who had just tried a surprise against<br>
the court.  Had it not been for the aid of Turenne, who had defended the<br>
bridge of Jargeau, the king might have fallen into the hands of his<br>
revolted subjects.  The queen rested at Gien whilst the princes went on<br>
as far as Montargis, thus cutting off the communications of the court<br>
with Paris.  Turenne was preparing to fall upon his incapable adversaries<br>
when the situation suddenly changed: the, Prince of Conde, weary of the<br>
bad state of his affairs in Guienne, where the veteran soldiers of the<br>
Count of Harcourt had the advantage everywhere over the new levies, had<br>
traversed France in disguise, and forming a junction, on the 1st of<br>
April, with the Dukes of Nemours and Beaufort, threw himself upon the<br>
quarters of Marshal d'Hocquincourt, defeated him, burned his camp, and<br>
drove him back to Bldneau; a rapid march on the part of Turenne, coming<br>
to the aid of his colleague, forced Conde to fall back upon Chatillon;<br>
on the 11th of April he was in Paris.<br>
<br>
The princes had relied upon the irritation caused by the return of<br>
Mazarin to draw Paris into the revolt, but they were only half<br>
successful; the Parliament would scarcely give Conde admittance;<br>
President de Bailleul, who occupied the chair in the absence of Mole,<br>
declared that the body always considered it an honor to see the prince in<br>
their midst, but that they would have preferred not to see him there in<br>
the state in which he was at the time, with his hands still bloody from<br>
the defeat of the king's troops.  Amelot, premier president of the Court<br>
of Aids, said to the prince's face, "that it was a matter of<br>
astonishment, after many battles delivered or sustained against his<br>
Majesty's troops, to see him not only returning to Paris without having<br>
obtained letters of amnesty, but still appearing amongst the sovereign<br>
bodies as if he gloried in the spoils of his Majesty's subjects, and<br>
causing the drum to be beaten for levying troops, to be paid by money<br>
coming from Spain, in the capital of the realm, the most loyal city<br>
possessed by the king."  The city of Paris resolved not to make "common<br>
cause or furnish money to assist the princes against the king under<br>
pretext of its being against Mazarin."  The populace alone were favorable<br>
to the princes' party.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Turenne had easy work with the secondary generals remaining at<br>
the head of the factious army; by his able maneeuvres he had covered the<br>
march of the court, which established itself at St. Germain.<br>
<br>
Conde assembled his forces encamped around Paris: he intended to fortify<br>
himself at the confluence of the Seine and the Marne, hoping to be<br>
supported by the little army which had just been brought up by Duke<br>
Charles of Lorraine, as capricious and adventurous as ever.  Turenne and<br>
the main body of his troops barred the passage.  Conde threw himself back<br>
upon Faubourg St. Antoine, and there intrenched himself, at the outlet of<br>
the three principal streets which abutted upon Porte St. Antoine (now<br>
Place do la Bastille).  Turenne had meant to wait for re-enforcements and<br>
artillery, but the whole court had flocked upon the heights of Charonne<br>
to see the fight; pressure was put upon him, and the marshal gave the<br>
word to attack.  The army of the Fronde fought with fury.  "I did not see<br>
a Prince of Conde," Turenne used to say; "I saw more than a dozen."  The<br>
king's soldiers had entered the houses, thus turning the barricades;<br>
Marshal Ferte had just arrived with the artillery, and was sweeping Rue<br>
St. Antoine.  The princes' army was about to be driven back to the foot<br>
of the walls of Paris, when the cannon of the Bastille, replying all on a<br>
sudden to the volleys of the royal troops, came like a thunderbolt on M.<br>
de Turenne; the Porte St. Antoine opened, and the Parisians, under arms,<br>
fringing the streets, protected the return of the rebel army.  Mdlle. de<br>
Montpensier had taken the command of the city of Paris.<br>
<br>
For a week past the Duke of Orleans had been ill, or pretended to be; he<br>
refused to give any order.  When the prince began his movement, on the 2d<br>
of July, early, he sent to beg Mdlle. not to desert him.  "I ran to the<br>
Luxembourg," she says, "and I found Monsieur at the top of the stairs.<br>
'I thought I should find you in bed,' said I; 'Count Fiesque told me that<br>
you didn't feel well.' He answered, 'I am not ill enough for that, but<br>
enough not to go out.'  I begged him to ride out to the aid of the<br>
prince, or, at any rate, to go to bed and assume to be ill; but I could<br>
get nothing from him.  I went so far as to say, 'Short of having a treaty<br>
with the court in your pocket, I cannot understand how you can take<br>
things so easily; but can you really have one to sacrifice the prince to<br>
Cardinal Mazarin?'  He made no reply: all I said lasted quite an hour,<br>
during which every friend we had might have been killed, and the prince<br>
as well as another, without anybody's caring; nay, there were people of<br>
Monsieur's in high spirits, hoping that the prince would perish; they<br>
were friends of Cardinal de Retz.  At last Monsieur gave me a letter for<br>
the gentlemen of the Hotel, leaving it to me to tell them his intention.<br>
I was there in a moment, assuring those present that, if ill luck would<br>
have it that the enemy should beat the prince, no more quarter would be<br>
shown to Paris than to the men who bore arms.  Marshal de l'Hopital,<br>
governor of Paris for the king, said to me, 'You are aware, Mdlle., that<br>
if your troops had not approached this city, those of the king would not<br>
have come thither, and that they only came to drive them away.'  Madame<br>
de Nemours did not like this, and began to argue the point.  I broke off<br>
their altercation.  'Consider, sir, that, whilst time is being wasted in<br>
discussing useless matters, the prince is in danger in your faubourgs.'"<br>
She carried with her the aid of the Duke of Orleans' troops, and<br>
immediately moved forwards, meeting everywhere on her road her friends<br>
wounded or dying.  "When I was near the gate, I went into the house of an<br>
exchequer-master (maitre des comptes).  As soon as I was there, the<br>
prince came thither to see me; he was in a pitiable state; he had two<br>
fingers' breadth of dust on his face, and his hair all matted; his collar<br>
and his shirt were covered with blood, although he was not wounded; his<br>
breastplate was riddled all over; and he held his sword bare in his hand,<br>
having lost the scabbard.  He said to me, 'You see a man in despair; I<br>
have lost all my friends; MM. de Nemours, de la Rochefoucauld, and<br>
Clinchamps are wounded to death.'  I consoled him a little by telling him<br>
that they were in better case than he supposed.  Then I went off to the<br>
Bastille, where I made them load the cannon which was trained right upon<br>
the city; and I gave orders to fire as soon as I had gone.  I went thence<br>
to the Porte St. Antoine.  The soldiers shouted, 'Let us do something<br>
that will astonish them; our retreat is secure; here is Mdlle. at the<br>
gate, and she will have it opened for us, if we are hard pressed.'  The<br>
prince gave orders to march back into the city; he seemed to me quite<br>
different from what he had been early in the day, though he had not<br>
changed at all; he paid me a thousand compliments and thanks for the<br>
great service he considered that I had rendered him.  I said to him,<br>
'I have a favor to ask of you: that is, not to say anything to Monsieur<br>
about the laches he has displayed towards you.'  At this very moment up<br>
came Monsieur, who embraced the prince with as gay an air as if he had<br>
not left him at all in the lurch.  The prince confessed that he had never<br>
been in so dangerous a position."<br>
<br>
The fight at Porte St. Antoine had not sufficiently compromised the<br>
Parisians, who began to demand peace at any price.  The mob, devoted to<br>
the princes, set themselves to insult in the street all those who did not<br>
wear in their hats a tuft of straw, the rallying sign of the faction.  On<br>
the 4th of July, at the general assembly of the city, when the king's<br>
attorney-general proposed to conjure his Majesty to return to Paris<br>
without Cardinal Mazarin, the princes, who demanded the union of the<br>
Parisians with themselves, rose up and went out, leaving the assembly to<br>
the tender mercies of the crowd assembled on the Place de Greve.  "Down<br>
on the Mazarins!" was the cry; "there are none but Mazarins any longer at<br>
the Hotel de Ville!"  Fire was applied to the doors defended by the<br>
archers; all the outlets were guarded by men beside themselves; more than<br>
thirty burgesses of note were massacred; many died of their wounds, the<br>
Hotel de Ville was pillaged, Marshal de l'Hopital escaped with great<br>
difficulty, and the provost of tradesmen yielded up his office to<br>
Councillor Broussel.  Terror reigned in Paris: it was necessary to drag<br>
the magistrates to the Palace of Justice to decree, on the 19th of July,<br>
by seventy-four votes against sixty-nine, that the Duke of Orleans should<br>
be appointed "lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and the Prince of Conde<br>
commandant of all the armies."  The usurpation of the royal authority was<br>
flagrant, the city-assembly voted subsidies, and Paris wrote to all the<br>
good towns of France to announce to them her resolution.  Chancellor<br>
Seguier had the poltroonery to accept the presidency of the council,<br>
offered him by the Duke of Orleans; he thus avenged himself for the<br>
preference the, queen had but lately shown for Mole by confiding the<br>
seals to him.  At the same time the Spaniards were entering France; for<br>
all the strong places were dismantled or disgarrisoned.  The king,<br>
obliged to confront civil war, had abandoned his frontiers; Gravelines<br>
had fallen on the 18th of May, and the arch-duke had undertaken the siege<br>
of Dunkerque.  At Conde's instance, he detached a body of troops, which<br>
he sent, under the orders of Count Fuendalsagna, to join the Duke of<br>
Lorraine, who had again approached Paris.  Everywhere the fortune of arms<br>
appeared to be against the king.  "This year we lost Barcelona,<br>
Catalonia, and Casale, the key of Italy," says Cardinal de Retz.  We saw<br>
Brisach in revolt, on the point of falling once more into the hands of<br>
the house of Austria.  We saw the flags and standards of Spain fluttering<br>
on the Pont Neuf, the yellow scarfs of Lorraine appeared in Paris as<br>
freely as the isabels and the blues."  Dissension, ambition, and<br>
poltroonery were delivering France over to the foreigner.<br>
<br>
The evil passions of men, under the control of God, help sometimes to<br>
destroy and sometimes to preserve them.  The interests of the Spaniards<br>
and of the Prince of Conde were not identical.  He desired to become the<br>
master of France, and to command in the king's name; the enemy were<br>
laboring to humiliate France and to prolong the war indefinitely: The<br>
arch-duke recalled Count Fuendalsagna to Dunkerque; and Turenne,<br>
withstanding the terrors of the court, which would fain have fled first<br>
into Normandy and then to Lyons, prevailed upon the queen to establish<br>
herself at Pontoise, whilst the army occupied Compiegne.  At every point<br>
cutting off the passage of the Duke of Lorraine, who had been re-enforced<br>
by a body of Spaniards, Turenne held the enemy in check for three weeks,<br>
and prevented them from marching on Paris.  All parties began to tire of<br>
hostilities.<br>
<br>
Cardinal Mazarin took his line, and loudly demanded of the king<br>
permission to withdraw, in order, by his departure, to restore peace to<br>
the kingdom.  The queen refused.  "There is no consideration shown," she<br>
said, "for my son's honor and my own; we will not suffer him to go away."<br>
But the cardinal insisted.  Prudent and far-sighted as he was, he knew<br>
that to depart was the only way of remaining.  He departed on the 19th of<br>
August, but without leaving the frontier: he took up his quarters at<br>
Bouillon.  The queen had summoned the Parliament to her at Pontoise.  A<br>
small number of magistrates responded to her summons, enough, however, to<br>
give the queen the right to proclaim rebellious the Parliament remaining<br>
at Paris.  Chancellor Srguier made his escape, in order to go and rejoin<br>
the court.  Nobody really believed in the cardinal's withdrawal; men are<br>
fond of yielding to appear ances in order to excuse in their own eyes a<br>
change in their own purposes.  Disorder went on increasing in Paris; the<br>
great lords, in their discontent, were quarrelling one with another; the<br>
Prince of Conde struck M. de Rieux, who returned the blow; the Duke of<br>
Nemours was killed in a duel by M. de Beaufort; the burgesses were<br>
growing weary of so much anarchy; a public display of feeling in favor<br>
