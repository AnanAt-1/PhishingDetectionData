PREFACE, 


When  the  idea  of  a  record  of  the  doings  of  the  old 
Club  with  which  he  had  been  originally  so  intimately 
connected  was  first  suggested  to  the  editor  of  the 
present  volume,  he  was  under  the  impression  that 
the  materials  available  were  more  complete  than 
upon  minute  investigation  proved  to  be  the  case. 
For  ten  or  twelve  years  after  its  formation  the  first 
Secretary  had  kept  a  record  of  its  matches,  but  this 
miscellaneous  chronicle  then  came  to  an  end  ;  and 
although  in  most  years  a  list  of  fixtures  was  pub- 
lished at  the  commencement  of  each  season,  it 
proved  impossible  to  trace  the  whole  of  the  matches 
thus  advertised,  some  of  which  were  never  played, 
while  others,  not  on  the  advertised  list,  were  substi- 
tuted for  them.  A  careful  search  has,  however, 
been  made  of  the  whole  of  the  cricket-reporting 
press  up  to  1883,  when  the  second  part  of  the 
chronicle  is  resumed  by  a  writer  more  competent 
to  deal  with  modern  cricket ;  and  it  is  to  be  hoped

PREFACE. 


that  the  joint  labours  of  the  two  annalists,  combined 
with  the  Illustrative  chapters  and  passages  obtained 
from  other  sources,  will  give  at  least  a  readable  and 
Intelligible  summary  of  a  series  of  campaigns  on  the 
mimic  battle  -  field,  creditable  to  an  association, 
united  in  aim  though  untied  by  rule,  whose  boast 
it  is  that  if  their  early  success  sent  them  up  like  a 
rocket,  they  have  not  yet  come  down  like  the  stick. 
To  many  Free  Foresters  who  have  assisted  with 
reminiscences,  and  to  the  members  and  friends  of 
the  Club,  who  have  encouraged  the  book  by  their 
subscriptions,  the  editor  says  one  word —

OF 


THE    FREE    FORESTERS. 


CHAPTER   I. 

PERSONAL. 

Horace  in  his  *  Art  of  Poetry '  blames  the  versifier  who, 
having  to  write  an  epic  on  the  Trojan  War,  began  with 
the  legend  of  Leda  and  the  egg.  But  in  spite  of  this  warn- 
ing, now  that  the  history  of  the  rise  and  progress  of  my  old 
club  are  to  be  recorded  in  print,  I  believe  the  reader  will 
adopt  the  words  of  the  Giant  Moulineau  in  the  French 
fairy-tale  to  his  friend  the  story-telling  ram,  "  Belier,  mon 
ami,  si  tu  voulois  commencer  par  le  commencement,  tu 
me  ferois  grand  plaisir,"  and  wish  for  the  narrative  of  the 
incubation  of  an  idea  which  has  turned  out  such  a 
success. 

To  the  inspiration  of  my  dear  and  honoured  friend 
the  Dean  of  Rochester  the  original  conception  of  Free 
Foresters  is  due.  Not  only  because  my  regard  for  him 
induced  me  to  seek  the  curacy  of  Southwell,  where  the 
cricket  aestrum  bit  more  strongly  than  in  any  "central

cricket  mead  "  of  those  days,  but  because  his  own  genuine 
and  hearty  love  for  all  that  is  manly  and  becoming  in- 
fected me  with  a  desire  for  the  promotion  of  that  which 
may  justly  be  termed  the  "  noble  science,"  the  game  of 
games. 

May  I  quote  from  my  scrap-book  one  personal  item  ? — 

"  A  Charade  elicited  by  the  '  rimy  '  state  of  the  Weather. 
Nov.  28,  1849.     Caimton  Manor. 

"  Within  my  first  grow  flow'rets  gay, 
And  oysters,  so  great  Pym  doth  say ; 
There  a  chief  part  of  life  is  past, 
Of  each  it  sees  the  first  and  last. 
My  second  was  when  long  ago 
Oxen  by  Isis  used  to  low, 
Cross  and  recross  where  now  is  seen 
Fair  Magdalen  in  reflected  sheen. 
My  whole's  a  town  and  title  great, 
And,  upon  this  I  most  dilate, 
A  friend,  for  whom  my  love's  a  strong  un, 
And  will  be  while  I  am 

The  Long  Un. 

In  Harry  V.,  Act  iv.  scene  i,  line  3, 

Who  cannot  guess,  may  there  the  answer  see." 

A  finale  which  brings  back  my  recollection  to  the  days 
when  the  "Long  Un's  "  nephew — now  a  distinguished  divine, 
then  a  chubby  jolly  schoolboy  of  some  seven  summers — 
used,  when  asked  for  a  Shakespeare  recitation,  to  select 
Henry  of  Monmouth's  speech  before  Agincourt,  "  because 
my  friend  Paul  is  in  that." 

It  is  said  that  a  great  lady  of  fashion  obtained  an  un- 
questioned supremacy  in  the  beau  monde  of  half  a  century 
ago,  because  she  not  only  gave  the  best  dinners,  but  sent 
the  best  written  reports  of  them  to  the  'Morning  Post' 
afterwards.  By  that  criterion  the  N.  C.  C. — the  Notting- 
hamshire County  (gentlemen)  Club — would  have  httn  facile

princeps^  with  the  Vicar  of  Caunton  as  their  historiographer. 
For  instance — 

Field  Day  of  the  Nottingham  Club  at  Southwell, 
Aug.  12,  185 1.      Old  v.  Young. 

Though  many  a  grouse  and  many  a  gunner  lies  among  the 
moors  to-day,  want  of  time  or  tin  keeps  most  men  from  wander- 
ing "  with  Scotia's  sons  'mong  heather  hills,"  and  hence  a  goodly 
muster  of  the  N.  C.  C.  for  a  battue  of  a  less  murderous  description. 
A  challenge  having  been  sent  from  the  nursery,  and  accepted  by 
the  potent,  grave,  and  reverend  seniors  to  test  the  truth  of  the 
Horatian  adage — 

"  Multa  ferunt  anni  venientes  commoda  secum  ; 
Multa  recedentes  adimunt ;  " 

behold  eleven  gentlemen,  "  i'  th'  sere  and  yellow  leaf  of  age,"  and 
in  raiment  of  flannel,  arrange  themselves  "with  measured  step 
and  slow "  in  the  field,  while  two  beings  in  the  hues  of  youth, 
"  scarcely  touching  the  ground,  they're  so  proud  and  elate,"  ad- 
vance, bat  in  hand  (sweet  babes  of  the  wood  /),  to  the  wicket. 
The  faces  of  the  aged  men,  just  before  "  sicklied  o'er  with  the 
pale  cast  of  thought,"  now  smile  "  as  they  were  wont  to  smile  " ; 
for  they  recall  once  more  "the  merry  days  when  they  were 
young  " — days  of  tame  rabbits  and  unripe  gooseberries,  departed 
never  to  return.  The  heart  yearns  for  auld  lang  syne,  as  traces  of 
recent  jam-and-bread  appear  on  the  cricket-jackets  of  the  boys,  and 
as  the  eye  of  each  centenarian  chief  descries  the  string  of  a  peg- 
top  hanging  from  the  pocket  of  Master  Tinley,  "  tears,  idle  tears  " 
(no  reflection  on  the  French  politician),  course  down  their  wrinkled 
cheeks.  Sweet  odours  of  buttered  Scotch  and  peppermint  per- 
vade the  ambient  air,  the  music  of  the  Hebrew  lyre  is  accom- 
panied by  castanets  of  slate — the  paper-covered  comb  is  there. 
Time  would  fail  to  tell  how  the  aged  Warwick  (for  an  account  of 
his  single  wicket  match  with  Widdicombe  600  B.C.  vide  Thucy- 
dides)  bowled  "cunningly  and  closely."  May  he  live  "longer 
than  I  have  time  to  tell  his  years,"  and  make  during  that  in- 
definite period  continual  leg-hits  for  four.  And  thou,  Goodrich ! 
Over  the  early  grave  of  many  a  young  cricketer  shall  it  be  written, 
"  Frightened  to  death  by  the  slow  bowling  of  Goodrich."  Praise, 
high  praise,  be  awarded  to  the  fine  batting  of  old  Mr  Northcote, 
who  still  shoulders  his  bat,  and  shows  how  fields  are  done ;  to 
the  bowling  of  the  grey-haired  Woolley  and  the  infantine  Falkner ; 
to  the  really  excellent  wicket-keeping  of  Master  R.  Wilkins  j  to

the  catch  made  "  'twixt  heaven  and  earth  "  by  a  very  High  Church- 
man from  the  bat  of  Tinley  {Fra?ik  playing  rather  too  free),  &amp;c. 
Suffice  it  to  subjoin  the  score,  with  the  hope  (to  quote  from  the 
poet  of  the  N.  C.  C.)  that— 

' '  Long,  long  in  park  of  noble, 

And  in  the  cottage  field, 
This  game  of  games  to  English  hearts 

Its  manly  joys  may  yield  ! 
And  oft  at  eve,  when  stumps  are  drawn, 

The  fragrant  weed  may  glow  ; 
As  we  tell  how  they  fell 

Where  Falkner's  swift  uns  go, 
Or  Goodrich,  with  his  artful  twist. 

Sends  in  the  teasers  slow." 

The  actual  score  would  be  but  "  leather  and  prunella  "  in 
the  present  day,  but  it  is  worth  noting  that  Frank  Tinley, 
so  humorously  described  as  a  boy,  was  the  eldest  of  the 
trio  of  Nottinghamshire  cricketers  of  that  name,  and  nearly 
forty  years  of  age  ;  while  old  Mr  Northcote  was  just  twenty- 
four.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  last  wicket  of  the 
"  young  "  stands  in  the  score  as  "  J.  Crow,  Esq."  ;  by  which 
was  signified  a  long  gipsy-looking,  barefooted  youth,  who 
ran  with  the  hounds  in  the  winter  in  an  old  stained  "pink," 
and  in  the  summer  haunted  the  cricket-ground,  where  he 
was  always  addressed  as  Jim  Crow,  and  was  ready  to  field 
or  bowl  to  you  for  sixpence  an  hour.  In  a  very  few  years 
I  met  my  old  acquaintance  again,  as  the  chief  bowler  of 
the  England  eleven,  J.  Jackson  ! 

With  most  of  the  amateurs  mentioned  in  the  above 
lively  narrative  I  was  personally  acquainted,  and  with  one 
of  them,  Mr  Goodrich,  I  formed  a  friendship  which  endured 
for  many  years,  cemented  not  more  by  his  admirable  cricket 
than  by  his  excellent  qualities  both  of  head  and  heart :  he 
was  a  true  friend  and  a  pleasant  companion.  When  he 
died  in  1885,  aged  sixty-two,  some  of  his  old  comrades  in 
the  cricket-field,  mostly  Free  Foresters,  erected  a  tablet  to 
his  memory  in  the  church  at  Stamford,  where  for  the  latter 
part  of  his  life   he  constantly  went,  with   an  inscription

W.  G.  Armitstead  :—

A    RARE   CRICKETER  AND    A   GOOD    MAN, 

WHO   DIED    MARCH    lOTH    1 885,    AGED   62. 

THIS   TABLET  WAS    ERECTED   BY   SOME   LOVING    FRIENDS. 

GIVING   ALL   DILIGENCE    HE   ADDED   TO   FAITH,  VIRTUE  ; 

AND   TO   VIRTUE,  KNOWLEDGE  ; 

AND   TO    KNOWLEDGE,   PATIENCE  ; 

AND   TO    PATIENCE,  GODLINESS  ; 

AND    TO    GODLINESS   BROTHERLY    KINDNESS. 

That  very  admirable  old  cricketer,  lately  lost  to  us,  the 
Rev.  Edward  Elmhirst,  wrote  of  Goodrich  : — 

He  was  a  most  useful  man  in  a  county  eleven,  a  difificult 
customer  at  the  wicket,  an  admirable  slow  bowler  with  a  twist  in 
Clarke's  style,  and  a  first-rate  field.  He  was  also  as  true  in  his 
character  and  friendship  as  in  his  metal  as  a  player. 

Mr  Pycroft,  too,  in  the  *  Cricket  Field/  though  he  spells 
the  name  wrong,  noticed  how  Mr  Goodrich  (Goodridge  he 
calls  him)  coincided  with  the  old  school  of  slow  bowlers 
in  his  delivery  of  the  ball  from  the  height  of  the  hip ;  and 
another  peculiarity  is  noted  by  the  Rev.  F.  Marshall  in  his 
excellent  volume  on  Rugby  football  (1892),  in  a  passage 
worth  quoting  verbatim  : — 

J.  A.  Boyle,  an  old  Malburian,  was  one  of  the  surest  of  place- 
kicks,  and  also  an  admirable  drop.  Curiously  enough,  when 
about  to  drop  he  did  not  hold  the  ball  in  the  usual  way,  but 
allowed  it  to  rest  on  the  extended  palm  of  one  hand  in  precisely 
the  same  manner  as  the  late  Mr  T.  C.  Goodrich,  the  famous 
Free  Foresters'  slow  underhand  bowler,  treated  a  cricket  -  ball 
before  delivering  it. 

In  a  cutting  which  Goodrich  preserved  among  his  scores 
I  find  the  following  : — 

Here  we  must  needs  record  a  curious  accident  which  befell 
the  well-known  player  Goodrich.  He  handled  the  ball :  no,  he 
did  not,  but  a  running  substitute  did  it  for  him.     How  civil  some 


6  PERSONAL. 

people  are !     They  say  civility  costs  nothing.     Here  at  all  events 
it  cost  Mi:  Cioodrich  his  innings. 

The  match  was  at  Stamford,  v,  N.  Northants,  Aug.  3  and 
4,  18 — .     Goodrich  got  15  and  23. 

The  first  object  I  had  in  view  in  the  foundation  of  Free 
Foresters  was  the  hope  of  keeping  alive  such  intimacies  as 
these,  by  means  of  the  game  which  is  the  most  sparkling 
channel  of  the  stream  of  friendship ;  but  as  the  necessity- 
presented  itself  for  considering  our  future  plans,  what 
matches  we  should  play,  where,  and  with  whom,  there 
arose  the  dim  dawning  of  another  purpose  which,  quixotic 
as  it  looked  then,  was  ultimately  fulfilled,  of  measuring 
ourselves  against  the  acknowledged  champions  of  the 
cricket-field,  without  that  hired  assistance  which  even  the 
strongest  cricket  centres  seemed  to  consider  indispensable 
when  they  were  about  to  meet  Clarke's  or  Wisden's  "  Eng- 
land "  elevens,  and  were  hardly  able  to  do  without  in  their 
contests  with  rival  counties  or  town  clubs.  I  have  delivered 
my  soul  elsewhere  upon  the  subject  of  the  hydra-headed 
E.'s,  as  the  author  of  *  Jerks  in  from  Short -leg'  called 
them,  and  indeed  may  recommend  the  chapter  on  that 
subject  in  the  wise  and  witty  volume  thus  named,  as 
expressing  my  sentiments  on  this  head;  but  the  type  of 
local  celebrity  who  was  prominent  in  fostering  these  con- 
tests was  so  amusingly  sketched  in  a  letter  which  my 
friend  Hole  wrote  me  one  day  about  this  time,  that  I 
obtained  his  permission  to  print  it  in  a  little  Oxford  mis- 
cellany of  sport  and  rhyme  which  appeared  in  1856,  and 
it  may  be  worth  reproduction  now.  It  is  entitled  "  *  Un- 
fulfilled Renown,'^  afifectingly  exemplified  in  the  History 
of  Sam  Hopkins,"  and  I  may  add,  in  many  of  its  details 
was  founded  on  an  episode  very  well  known  to  Midland 
cricketers  at  that  date  : —

SAM  HOPKINS.  7 

I  never  could  understand,  and  Sam  could  never  explain  to  me, 
how  it  came  to  pass,  one  fine  summer's  afternoon,  that  he  went 
to  his  wicket,  at  a  country  cricket  match,  and  got  a  tremendous 
innings.  I  am  aware,  of  course,  that  the  players  were  amateurs ; 
that  Sam  achieved  his  greatness  after  so  much  champagne  had 
been  consumed  at  luncheon,  that  the  bowler  was  transcendentally, 
and  the  field  materially,  intoxicated.  I  know,  too,  that  the 
umpire  was  his  particular  friend,  and  was  very  severely  criticised 
(and  indeed  challenged  to  fight  by  some  vulgar  people  who  had 
lost  their  money)  for  his  devotion  to  Sam's  interests ;  but  after 
all,  I  could  never  understand  it;  and  he,  as  I  have  said,  was 
equally  astonished. 

But  be  this  as  it  may,  the  next  morning  Sam  "awoke  and 
found  himself  famous." 

'  Bell's  Life '  pronounced  him  famous  in  an  article  supplied  by 
the  faithful  umpire,  and  which  Sam  was  never  tired  of  reading. 
They  said  he  took  it  to  bed  with  him ;  and  they  said  also,  which 
I  decline  to  believe,  that  he  was  seen,  on  the  first  day  of  its 
appearance,  to  peep  at  it  during  the  sermon.  All  I  know  for 
certain  is  this,  that  when  he  had  read  it,  he  bought  six  new 
cricket-bats  and  a  box  of  weeds  for  the  umpire. 

Well,  the  next  time  Sam  played  at  cricket,  the  world  and  his 
wife  they  came  to  see. 

The  world  and  his  wife  took  no  interest  in  the  game  whatever 
until  Sam  came  forth  in  his  glory  (he  was  a  fat  man  was  Sam, 
and  looked,  when  attired  in  flannel,  so  like  a  bed  as  to  make  one 
feel  quite  sleepy),  and  then  the  world  put  on  his  spectacles,  and 
his  wife  laid  aside  her  knitting. 

The  reporters  pointed  their  pencils,  and  took  special  note  of 
the  time  of  day. 

The  gentleman  in  command  of  the  opposition  altered  the  field 
some  fourteen  times,  and  sent  out  the  man  who  could  catch  about 
half  a  mile  into  the  country. 

Sam  went  slowly  forth,  drawing  on  a  pair  of  gloves  which  I 
feel  convinced  would  have  supplied  with  India-rubber  all  the 
ladies'  schools  in  Brighton ;  and  as  he  went  there  passed  a 
murmur  through  the  multitude,  "  That's  the  celebrated  Mr 
'Opkins !  " 

'^  Mr  O  "  employed  himself  for  some  minutes,  and  with  great 
dignity,  in  obtaining  a  satisfactory  ^^ guard";  and  then  having 
superciliously  surveyed  the  field  (bestowing  a  look  of  especial 
scorn  upon  the  man  who  was  posted  in  the  adjoining  parish  to 
catch  him,  as  though  that  gentleman  was  not  half  far  enough  for 
the  hits  which  Sam  had  designed),  he  went  behind  the  wicket 
and  superciliously  surveyed  the  bowler. 


8  PERSONAL. 

A  silence,  which  might  be  felt,  was  broken  by  the  voice  of  the 
umpire — '''' Play^ 

Whizz  went  the  ball,  and  "  Oh  Lor''  I'^  roared  Sam  Hopkins, 
nobbled  in  some  unguarded  part. 

The  bowler  was  a  professional  this  time,  quite  sober,  and  had 
a  "  ripping  "  pace. 

A  spectator  was  heard  to  say,  "  Poor  ole  bloater " ;  but  the 
crowd  still  knew  that  he  was  famous. 

The  bowler  moistened  his  digits,  as  though  preparing  stamps 
for  adhesion,  and  proceeded  to  deliver  ball  No.  2.  Away  it 
went,  swift  and  straight  from  his  hand ;  and  away  went  also  (alas, 
alas  !)  the  bat  from  the  hand  of  Hopkins  ! 

The  multitude  awoke,  at  once,  as  a  man  from  dreams — awoke, 
and  laughed  at  Sam  ! 

Again  the  professional  assails  the  wicket;  the  maddened 
Hopkins  lashes  out  for  four,  and  away  (with  his  middle  stump) 
go  his  fame  and  glory  as  "a  first-rate  Bat." 

So  went  he  up,  like  the  rocket,  and  so  came  he  down,  like  the 
stick. 

It  must  be  clear  to  every  one  who  laughs  at  this  smart 
and  lifelike  character  sketch,  that  the  Sam  Hopkins  ele- 
ment never  could,  with  any  amount  of  cultivation,  have 
developed  into  the  style  of  cricketer  of  which  I  was  in 
search ;  in  fact,  it  was  his  material  which  I  wished  to 
exclude:  but  at  that  time  public-school  cricket-training 
was  becoming  more  systematic,  and  a  rising  generation 
was  springing  up,  not  merely  from  Winchester,  Eton,  and 
Harrow,  but  from  new  schools  like  Cheltenham,  and  old 
ones  like  Westminster  and  Rugby.  With  all  these  three, 
and  especially  the  last-named,  our  prosperity  was  in  a 
measure  to  be  identified,  though  from  the  three  who  in 
that  day  were  the  only  contestants  at  Lords,  and  from 
Charterhouse  and  other  school  elevens,  we  drew  some  of 
our  earliest  and  best  recruits.  The  Kempsons,  Matthew 
and  George,  of  Cheltenham,  and  the  Garnetts,  mostly  then 
at  the  same  school,  were  neighbours  of  mine,  and  I  set  to 
work  to  prepare  a  ground  at  my  own  house  where  I  hoped 
good  cricket  might  be  played.

have  been  proud  of  being  similarly  assailed  ;  but  I  re- 
member an  incident  of  my  Oxford  days  which  points  a 
moral,  so  I  v/ill  relate  it  instead. 

The  cox  of  a  certain  college  boat  had  a  soul  much  too 
large  for  his  eight-stone-six.  He  was,  to  use  Dean  Hole's 
name  for  a  certain  pugnacious  politician  of  small  stature, 
a  "  belligerent  bantam "  ;  and  one  day  he  was  observed 
pacing  the  quad  with  such  evident  discomposure  that  a 
friend  felt  constrained  to  inquire  what  was  wrong.  "  My 
usual  luck,  old  fellow,"  replied  B.  B.,  with  tears  in  his 
eyes  ;  "  here's  Moore  "  (the  stroke  of  the  boat,  as  "  strong 
and  mighty"  as  his  namesake  who  slew  the  dragon  of 
Wantley)  "  been  called  a  foul  name  by  a  bargee,  and  he's 
licked  the  cad  !     No  bargee  ever  calls  me  a  foul  name." 

The  second  of  the  brothers,  W.  G.  Armitstead,  who 
played  in  the  Oxford  eleven  for  four  years  at  that  time, 
was  an  admirable  hard-hitting  batsman,  and  a  very  fine 
field.  He  will  be  found  hereafter  in  this  chronicle  as 
"middle  Jack"  ;  for  the  eldest  brother's  name  being  John, 
he  had  transmitted  the  familiar  appellation  to  the  junior 
members  of  the  family,  with  the  difference,  as  heralds  say, 
of  "middle"  and  "little."  John,  who  had  been  a  boating 
man  at  Westminster,  did  not  play  very  much  with  us, 
but  William  and  Henry  were  of  our  most  constant  cham- 
pions. They  promised  to  bring  an  eleven  to  inaugurate 
my  new  ground,  and  it  was  on  this  occasion,  in  1856,  that 
the  title  Free  Foresters  was  invented,  from  the  circum- 
stance that  all  my  eleven  were  from  the  precincts  of  the 
Forest  of  Arden  in  Warwickshire,  or  Needwood  in  Stafford- 
shire. The  score  would  hardly  be  worth  giving  in  extenso^ 
save  for  the  fact  of  its  containing  the  names  of  those  who 
have  a  right  to  style  themselves  the  first  Free  Forester 
eleven.  The  small  totals  speak  volumes  as  to  the  con- 
dition of  ground  which  forty  years  ago  was  to  be  met  with 


THE  FIRST  MATCH.

in  country  cricket.  My  friend  Mr  Reay  reminds  me : 
"  Scores  were  generally  smaller  in  those  days,  when  there 
were  no  boundaries,  no  cane-handled  bats,  and  the  wicket 
was  mown  with  a  scythe  at  3  A.M.  on  the  morning  of  the 
match,  and  the  rest  of  the  ground  only  fed  by  sheep."

It  will  be  noticed  that  the  Garnetts  were  to  the  fore  in 
both  matches.  Of  these  there  were  two  families,  Charles 
Garnett  and  his  brother  Robert  both  residing  then  in 
the  neighbourhood  of  Tamworth,  the  house  of  the  first-

named,  Bonehill,  being  in  Staffordshire,  while  Moor 
Hall,  where  Robert  lived,  was  over  the  Warwickshire 
border.  They  were  veterans  by  this  time,  but  had  large 
families  of  sons,  all  pretty  good  with  bat  and  ball.  (The 
eldest  of  the  Bonehill  family,  C.  A.  Garnett,  played  for 
Oxford  University  in  i860  and  1862.)  A  third  brother  of 
Charles  and  Robert  Garnett  resided  at  Wyreside  in 
Lancashire,  and  a  little  later  on  played  for  us,  as  did 
several  of  his  sons  in  after-years.  Of  those  now  mentioned,. 
A.  P.  was  subsequently  Colonel  of  the  nth  Hussars,  while 
R.  J.  and  F.  H.  also  went  into  the  army.  And  it  was  part 
of  our  plan  that  the  three  names  of  Armitstead,  Bedford^ 
and  Garnett  should  rank  as  founder's  kin,  and  give  a  title 
to  membership  to  those  cricketers  whom  they  furnished 
for  us. 

The  composition  of  the  Club  was  intended  to  have 
a  Midland  county  character  —  not  to  be  a  provincial 
I  Zingari,  because  we  did  not  propose  to  exact  that 
unlimited  fealty  to  our  colours  which  the  queen-mother  of 
amateur  wandering  elevens  so  rigidly  requires,  but  to 
imitate  that  unrivalled  Club  in  dispensing  altogether  with 
the  hired  assistance  without  which  some  of  the  strongest 
local  clubs  of  gentlemen  then  imagined  themselves  unable 
to  play  matches.  This  was  the  meaning  of  the  motto  we 
adopted,  "  United  though  untied,"  which  I  borrowed  from 
an  epigram  I  met  with  in  some  book  of  the  period,  the 
words  of  which  I  cannot  now  recall,  and  adapted  it  to  a 
heraldic  design  called  the  Hastings  knot,  a  cord  loosely 
entwined  connecting  a  sickle  and  a  wheat-sheaf,  for  which 
we  substituted  two  capital  F's,  as  in  the  title-page. 
Neither  this  badge  nor  our  colours  were,  however,  at  that 
time  definitely  adopted  ;  and  indeed  our  success  in  our  first 
out- matches  was  not  such  as  to  encourage  us,  for  two 
defeats  were  at  once  experienced,  viz.  \—

CHAPTER    III. 

1858. 

The  Rubicon  then  was  crossed,  but  what  next  and  next  ? 
Were  we  to  join  the  "  swarm  of  butterflies,  grasshoppers, 
chrysalis,  wasps,  drones,  and  other  ephemeral  bodies  that 
quicken  in  the  summer-time  under  the  genial  influence  of 
cricket,"  ^  consider  the  lawn  match  our  metier^  and  a  pretty- 
ribbon  and  a  pleasant  autumn  the  objects  of  our  ambition ; 
or  fling  down  the  gauntlet  to  clubs  of  higher  pretensions  in 
the  recognised  centres  of  cricket  ?  In  either  event  we 
required  some  kind  of  organisation  ;  so  when  we  met  at 
Oxford  on  the  ist  of  June  1858,  we  at  once  proceeded  to 
appoint  a  secretary  and  a  committee,  the  first  office  falling 
to  my  share,  and  four  cricketers  being  selected  from  our 
ranks  as  committee  men  representing  the  various  interests 
bound  up  in  our  welfare.  One  of  the  most  prominent  of 
these  was  a  man  hardly  less  instrumental  in  raising  our 
Club  to  the  proud  position  which  it  eventually  attained 
than  were  Armitstead  or  Goodrich — Arthur  Faber,  Fellow 
of  New  College,  who  a  few  years  later  became  headmaster 
of  the  newly  founded  school  at  Malvern, — a  preferment 
which  caused  us  to  lose  the  services  of  a  player  who  ought 
to  be  remembered  as  having  held  the  premier  place  in  the 
batting  averages  of  amateur  cricket  in  the  year  immediately 

^  'Jerks  in  from  Short-leg.' 


A.   H.   FABER.  17 

preceding  the  rise  of  Mr  W.  G.  Grace.  Faber  was  not  only 
a  fine  cricketer,  but  a  fine  scholar,  a  sayer  of  good  things, 
and  a  singer  of  good  songs.  One  not  to  be  forgotten, 
"King  Richard  of  England/'  pronounced  by  men  well 
versed  in  the  lighter  minstrelsy  the  best  in  that  particular 
line  of  parody  ever  heard,  obtained  a  great  popularity  ;  but 
I  preferred  another  spirited  lilt,  which  recounted  the 
adventures  of  certain  Oxford  oarsmen  upon  the  Rhine, 
starting  thus  : — 

"  'Twas  on  a  summer's  evening,  when  July  was  close  at  hand, 
And  half  the  men  in  London  dined  at  Simpson's  in  the  Strand  ; 
But  the  ones  who  called  the  waiters  there  in  far  the  loudest  tones 
Were  Messrs  Brown  and  Robinson  and  John  James  Jones." 

The  expedition  is  matured  over  their  wine,  and  they 
proceed  to  put  their  design  into  execution,  and  after  a 
humorous  description  of  a  Channel  passage,  are  launched 
upon  the  stream.  Of  course  there  has  to  be  a  love  story, 
which  comes  out  thus  : — 

"  Innumerable  conquests,  too,  they  made  among  the  ladies  gay, 
Who  flocked  upon  the  towing-path  to  cheer  them  on  their  way  ; 
And  in  spite  of  being  rather  plain,  a  truth  one  rarely  owns. 
Brown  backed  his  luck  at  six  to  four  'gainst  John  James  Jones. 

Jones  took  the  bet,  as  on  ladies  a  bet  one  always  takes  ; 

The  money  was  deposited,  and  Robin  held  the  stakes. 

To  a  blue-eyed  girl  they  told  their  tale  in  most  affecting  tones, 

While  Robin  clinked  the  cash  of  Brown  and  John  James  Jones." 

By-and-by  comes  the  decision  of  the  bet. 

"  To  her  home  on  wings  of  love  they  flew,  but  found  her  also  flown, 
And  what  was  worse,  bold  Robin,  taking  both  their  bets  as  loafis, 
Had  eloped  with  the  girl  of  the  heart  of  Brown  and  John  James 
Jones ! " 

Perhaps  this  is  a  little  caviare  to  a  cricket  chronicle, 
but  the  fact  remains  that  the  tone  of  good-fellowship 
generated  by  such  enlivening  pastime  helped  us  materially 

B 


l8  THE  RIBBON. 

in  our  enterprises  in  the  more  legitimate  game.  We  had 
very  httle  formahty  as  a  club.  By  way  of  proof,  I  may 
mention  that  our  rules  were  never  printed  until  1867,  and 
one  of  the  most  important  in  its  ultimate  results  upon 
the  prosperity  of  the  Club  never  appears  to  have  been 
printed  at  all,  although  acted  upon  as  an  understanding 
from  the  commencement — namely,  that  while  we  desired 
to  restrict  the  numbers  and  the  local  qualification  of  our 
ordinary  members,  these  limitations  were  not  to  apply  to 
officers  in  her  Majesty's  service.  The  ribbon,  as  at  present 
arranged,  was  adopted  at  this  meeting,  though  not  with 
unanimity — an  arrangement  of  darker  shades  of  red,  green, 
and  black  being  the  competing  design.  I  fancy  that  part 
of  the  objection  to  the  "  red  and  green  and  white  "  arose 
from  some  of  our  older  members,  who  dubbed  it  a  "Radical." 
ribbon,  the  Chartists  of  1848  having  sported  a  tricolour  of 
the  same  tints  ;  and  that  it  had  a  political  significance,  in 
Italy  at  least,  was  evidenced  by  the  rather  vexatious 
incident  which  occurred  to  a  lady,  whose  brothers  and 
husband  are  among  our  founder's  kin,  upon  the  occasion 
of  a  visit  to  Rome  in  Carnival  time,  while  the  temporal 
power' of  the  Pope  still  existed,  and  Garibaldi  was  still 
**  hushed  in  grim  repose."     She  has  narrated  it  herself. 

What  came  of  wearing  a  Forester  Ribbon. 

The  following  morning  we  were  at  Civita  Vecchia.  I  was  now 
informed  that  upon  landing  we  entered  the  States  of  the  Church, 
and  all  our  luggage  would  have  to  pass  through  the  Custom- 
house. As  we  had  no  servant  with  us,  our  English  friends  kindly 
suggested  that  our  boxes  should  go  with  theirs  under  the  charge 
of  their  Italian  servant,  who  would  look  after  them  at  the  Custom- 
house and  meet  us  at  the  station.  Poor  Rozelli,  he  little  knew 
what  he  was  undertaking.  You  must  remember  it  was  just  after 
the  time  when  Garibaldi  had  been  fighting  so  hard  for  Italy,  and 
the  Pope  had  found  his  temporal  dominions  considerably  reduced. 
There  was  consequently  a  very  bitter  feeling  throughout  the  States 
of  the  Church  against  all  Italians  who  were  not  the  subjects  of  his 


A   POLITICAL   OFFENCE.  19 

Holiness,  and  no  sooner  did  any  one  set  their  foot  in  his  domin- 
ions than  they  became  Hable  to  the  closest  watching,  and  impris- 
onment for  the  slightest  offence  of  a  political  nature.  We  were 
at  the  station,  and  had  taken  our  tickets  for  Rome,  when  the  elder 
of  our  two  English  friends  came  to  me  in  a  state  of  great  agitation, 
and  asked  me  almost  fiercely  what  I  was  doing  with  the  Italian 
tricolour  in  my  box  ? 

I  was  utterly  at  a  loss  to  comprehend  his  meaning,  and  said  I 
knew  nothing  about  any  Italian  tricolour,  and  was  quite  sure  I  had 
no  such  thing.  "Yes,"  he  said,  "you  have  some  kind  of  a  loose 
white  dress  in  your  box,  such  as  is  worn  at  the  Carnival,  and  it 
has  Garibaldi's  ribbon  all  over  it." 

I  thought  for  a  moment.  "  Can  it  be  my  dressing-gown  ?  "  I 
said,  a  light  beginning  to  dawn  upon  me ;  "  that  is  trimmed  with 
a  red,  white,  and  green  ribbon,  but  that  has  nothing  to  do  with 
Garibaldi ;  it  is  nothing  in  the  world  but  the  ribbon  of  the  Free 
Foresters'  Cricket  Club :  I  had  it  made  to  wear  at  a  cricket  match, 
and  thinking  it  a  pity  to  throw  it  away  had  it  transferred  to  my 
white  dressing-gown.  You  surely  cannot  mean  to  say  that  this 
has  given  offence  ?  " 

"  Given  offence  !  "  he  replied  ;  "  we  may  think  ourselves  very 
lucky  we  are  not  now  all  under  arrest :  my  man  Rozelli  has  been 
nearly  frantic,  for  he  of  course  knew  nothing  about  it,  and  the 
very  first  thing  that  came  to  view  when  your  box  was  opened 
was  this  '  rebel '  ribbon.  Of  course  the  authorities  inquired  what 
was  the  meaning  of  it,  and  all  poor  Rozelli  could  do  was  to  shake 
his  head  and  say,  'I  am  innocent.'  He  has  been  .taken  to  the 
Consul  about  it  now,  and  I  have  no  idea  how  it  will  all  end." 

At  this  moment  Rozelli  appeared,  and  looking  reproachfully  at 
me,  began  a  long  story  in  which  he  told  us  how  we  had  narrowly 
escaped  imprisonment,  but  that  being  English  had  saved  us.  The 
ribbon  had  been  torn  off  the  dressing-gown  by  the  Custom-house 
officials  and  kept  there ;  and  a  little  jacket  which  they  could  not 
strip,  the  ribbon  being  rather  tightly  sewn  on,  they  had  also  kept. 

The  man  Rozelli,  it  seemed,  was  a  Roman  by  birth,  and  had 
years  ago  been  in  the  service  of  the  celebrated  Lola  Montez.  He 
was  well  known  to  the  police,  and  was  closely  watched  the  whole 
time  his  master  remained  in  Rome.  For  ourselves,  as  soon  as  we 
got  over  the  annoyance,  we  thought  it  a  great  joke,  but  I  do  not 
think  Rozelli  ever  understood  it.  I  believe  we  were  all  more  or 
less  watched  by  the  police  during  our  stay  in  Rome.  It  was  the 
Carnival  week,  and  I  had  an  opportunity  of  seeing  the  long  white 
wrappers  that  were  worn  to  keep  off  the  confetti,  and  for  one  of 
which  my  poor  innocent  dressing-gown  had  been  taken,  it  being 
supposed  by  the  Custom-house  officers  that  I  was  taking  it  to 


20  OXFORD. 

Rome  to  wear  at  the  Carnival  to  create  a  demonstration  in  favour 
of  Garibaldi.  Little  did  the  Free  Foresters  dream  when  they 
fixed  upon  their  colours  what  a  foolish  adventure  they  would 
cause !  I  was  told  I  could  have  my  ribbon  given  back  to  me 
at  Civita  Vecchia  on  leaving,  but  when  after  a  week  of  sight- 
seeing and  gaiety  we  retraced  our  steps,  I  said  to  James,  "  No, 
we  will  not  ask  for  it :  let  us  give  them  the  trouble  of  taking  care 
oi\X.for  ever.^^  And  so  I  suppose  the  Free  Foresters'  ribbon  still 
remains  in  the  Custom-house. 

The  season  of  1858  was  decisive  also  of  our  pretensions 
to  superiority,  although  at  first  no  results  of  moment  fol- 
lov^ed  our  contests. 

On  June  i  Free  Foresters  beat  Bullingdon  at  Oxford, 
making  185  to  their  hosts'  135  and  22  for  3  wickets.  For 
BuUingdon  J.  Gundry  scored  29  and  3,  J.  Carpenter  27 
and  I,  G.  W.  Barker  15  and  13  (not  out),  Burrin  (pro.)  14. 
For  F.  F.  H.  Latham  scored  58,  G.  S.  Homfray  37,  H.  S. 
Chinn  22,  W.  M.  Jervis  16. 

On  June  2  and  3  Ch.  Ch.  beat  them  by  228  to  165.  For 
Ch.  Ch.  C.  G.  Lane  scored  28  and  41,  J.  G.  Edwards  26  and  8^ 
A.  Thesiger  13  and  18,  W.  Fellowes  o  (absent)  and  26,  T, 
Houghton  o  and  20,  W.  B.  Beaumont  o  and  16  (run  out). 
For  F.  F.  H.  S.  Armitstead  scored  i  and  47,  J.  Fenton  o 
(not  out)  and  24  (not  out),  J.  E.  Codrington  5  and  19,  W. 
M.  Jervis  1 1  and  o. 

On  June  4  they  beat  B.  N.  C.  by  99  to  51.  For  B.  N.  C, 
D.  G.  Thomas  scored  15,  J.  Morley  12.  For  F.  F.  W.  B. 
Beaumont  scored  15  and  24  (not  out),  S.  Birch  11,  G.  S. 
Homfray  17  and  o.  It  was  in  this  match  that  Homfray 
hit  Brandt,  bowling  for  his  College,  four  times  running  out 
of  the  ground.  One  F.  F.  wicket  was  dow^n  in  the  second 
innings  for  36. 

On  June  23  Maidenhead  beat  Free  Foresters  by  289  to 
138,  Onslow  and  Thesiger  being  the  F.  F.  bowlers ;  and  as 
Parsons,  who  played  his  qualifying  match,  well  remembers, 
a  hot  afternoon's  leather-hunting  was  particularly  trying.. 


LORD  STAMFORD.  21 

The  Maidenhead  score  included  62  extras,  and  75  runs 
from  G.  R.  Dupuis,  54  from  S.  Leigh,  29  from  C.  Leigh, 
26  from  A.  Leigh.  For  F.  F.  O.  F.  Wakeman  scored  55 
(not  out),  W.  M.  Jervis  21,  J.  Parsons  20,  C.  Everett  17. 

On  the  29th  and  30th  Rugby  Club  beat  Free  Foresters 
at  Sutton  by  153  to  129.  Buchanan  for  Rugby  took  12 
wickets. 

On  July  3  King  Edward's  School,  Birmingham,  lost  to 
F.  F.  by  9  wickets;  and  on  July  21  the  Forest  of  Arden, 
at  Meriden,  scored  93  and  79  with  7  wickets  to  fall,  against 
F.  F.'s  first  innings  of  124, — Homfray  42.  Two  days  later 
Trentham,  at  Sandbach,  made  64  and  51  with  5  wickets 
to  fall,  against  Foresters'  255,  including  86  from  W.  G. 
Armitstead. 

On  the  26th  and  27th  July  at  Rugby  the  home  Club 
were  beaten  by  Foresters  by  3  wickets,  Goodrich  disposing 
of  fourteen  Rugbeians  ;  and  on  the  31st  Birmingham, 
though  playing  their  professional,  could  only  total  128 
in  both  innings,  against  F.  F.   129  in  the  first. 

But  now  came  the  crisis  of  the  fate  of  our  brotherhood. 
We  were  honoured  by  an  invitation  to  play  against  Lord 
Stamford's  team  on  the  famous  ground  of  Enville, — a 
ground  the  like  of  which  for  perfection  in  a  cricket  point 
of  view  I  never  saw  until  I  visited  Newbold  Revel  a  year 
or  two  ago.  Lord  Stamford  himself  was  a  fine  batsman 
who  often  made  runs  for  I  Zingari.  He  had  always  some 
of  the  very  best  professional  talent  of  the  day  engaged  as 
groundmen,  and  the  pick  of  the  M.  C.  C.  invariably  ready 
to  play  for  him,  so  that  we  were  quite  satisfied  that  we 
should  have  to  accept  a  certain  defeat  as  a  price  which  we 
should  have  been  wrong  to  grudge  paying  for  a  recognition 
of  our  status  in  so  eminent  a  quarter.  So  we  set  ourselves 
to  work  to  find  what,  next  to  a  good  cook,  seems  the 
hardest  person  in  the  world  to  lay  hold  of — a  really  depend- 
able bowler,  who  could  do  for  us  at  one  end  what  Goodrich 


22         •  F.   BRANDT. 

we  knew  was  capable  of  doing  at  the  other.  Just  then  a 
Manchester  cricketer  of  very  high  repute,  who  frequently 
played  in  England  matches,  George  Cooke,  wrote  warmly 
recommending  a  Cheltenham  College  bowler  recently 
entered  at  Oxford,  Frank  Brandt  ("  the  devastating 
Brandt,"  as  Faber,  quoting  from  Campbell's  poem,  dubbed 
him),  who  was  in  his  judgment  just  what  we  required,  with 
the  support  of  a  good  field  like  that  which  we  could  assure 
him  of.  So  we  enlisted  him.  We  were  certainly  favoured 
by  fortune  at  the  outset,  for  our  opponents,  who  won  the 
toss,  kindly  put  us  in,  some  of  our  men  having  been 
delayed  at  the  junction  of  a  cross-country  railway.  Faber 
and  Homfray  started  the  batting,  and  although  the  bowlers 
to  whom  they  were  opposed  were  C.  D.  Marsham,  A.  Payne, 
and  Drake,  lOO  runs  appeared  on  the  board  before  the 
first  wicket  fell.  Homfray  played  cricket  for  so  short  a 
time,  owing  to  his  change  of  residence  and  premature 
failure  of  health,  that  few  even  of  our  own  members  ever 
saw  him,  or  remember  the  cleanest  and  finest  hitter  almost 
ever  seen  (he  hits  harder  than  George  Parr,  said  a  famous 
judge  of  the  game),  as  quick  on  his  legs  too  as  he  was 
strong  in  punishment.  His  score  of  83  virtually  won  us 
the  match;  and  considering  that  the  best  gentlemen  bowlers 
of  the  day  were  his  assailants,  it  is  worthy  to  rank  even 
with  some  of  the  phenomenal  innings  of  modern  times. 
Faber  supported  him  well  with  a  hard  hit  26.  Scholes 
Birch,  a  cricketer  of  Manchester  fame,  and  a  slow  bowler 
whom  we  used  to  alternate  advantageously  with  Good- 
rich, made  29,  and  the  Armitsteads  both  achieved  double 
figures,  our  total  being  203,  then  considered  a  long  innings. 
Enville  began  with  A.  F.  Payne  and  the  Hon.  G.  Milles, 
now  Earl  Sondes  (who  had  played  against  players  the 
year  before),  and  Brandt  secured  both  wickets  for  no  runs  ; 
Capt.  F.  Marshall  and  Drake  put  a  different  complexion 
on  the  score,  making  51  apiece,  but  when  Goodrich  had 


ENVILLE  MATCH.  23 

disposed  of  them  both,  no  great  stand  ensued,  though  all 
made  runs  down  to  the  two  servants,  not  professional 
cricketers,  but  active  fellows  in  good  practice,  who  com- 
pleted the  house  eleven.  The  total  was  188,  only  15 
behind  ours ;  and  when  we  all  got  out  for  63  it  seemed  a 
certain  win  for  his  Lordship,  and  had  not  our  men  been 
quicker  and  steadier  in  the  field  than  most  elevens  were 
then,  or  indeed  are  nowadays,  we  could  not  have  hoped 
to  get  them  out,  as  we  did,  for  58  runs,  their  only  double 
figures  being  obtained  by  Capt.  Marshall,  A.  Payne,  and 
Wingfield  Fiennes,  all  three  being  caught  at  point  by 
Faber,  two  off  Brandt  and  one  off  Goodrich.  Brandt 
accounted  for  two  more,  and  Goodrich  for  five.  I  regret 
that  I  never  obtained  the  analysis  of  bowling.  It  was 
certainly  a  great  feat,  and  was  handsomely  acknowledged 
as  such  by  our  opponents.  Goodrich,  not  much  of  a 
ladies'  man,  was  put  into  a  state  of  considerable  embar- 
rassment by  the  desire  of  Lady  Stamford  that  he  should 
be  presented  to  her,  whereupon  with  a  pretty  speech  she 
decorated  him  with  a  flower  for  his  button-hole.  But 
nobody  could  help  seeing  that  this  victory  over  a  side  of 
such  high  cricket  celebrity  placed  us  in  a  very  different 
position  to  that  which  we  had  held  before — in  the  premier 
rank  at  any  rate  of  the  Midland  clubs.

We  won  another  match  at  Trentham  on  the  12th  and 
13th  Aug.  against  an  eleven  of  Capt.  J.  Broughton's,  with 
4  wickets  to  fall,  Goodrich  again  taking  13  wickets.  And 
we  then  played  a  couple  of  matches  in  Manchester  from 
the  1 8th  to  the  21st,  one  of  which,  with  the  Manchester 
Club,  who  played  their  "pro.,"  Hunt,  we  won  by  3  wickets, 
though  after  the  winning  run  had  been  obtained  Henry 
Garnett  tried  a  second,  and  paid  the  penalty.  The  other 
match  on  the  Western  ground  terminated  in  a  tie  in  rather 
a  curious  manner. 

The. Western  were  not  in  those  days  at  all  a  strong  club, 
but  they  had  playing  for  them  an  officer  from  the  cavalry 
barracks  near,  Kington  by  name,  a  fine  hitter,  and  had 
also  strengthened  their  side  by  two  professionals,  Wright 
and  Nixon.  Foresters  made  a  poor  show  with  the  bat, 
only  6y  and  85 — J.  S.  Dugdale  and  Goodrich  being  the 
double-figure  men  in  both  innings.  Against  this,  with  the 
assistance  of  50  from  Kington,  the  Western  made  115,  so 
that  in  their  second  innings  they  had  only  38  to  get  to 
win,  and  thought  that  the  state  of  the  score  quite  'justified 
them  in  letting  Nixon  go  away  to  fulfil  some  other  engage- 
ment. So  it  did  ;  for  at  the  fall  of  the  sixth  wicket  their 
score  was  36,  and  their  victory  appeared  a  moral  certainty. 


A    TIE  MATCH.  25 

Two  more  wickets  fell,  however,  for  but  one  run,  and  the 
last  man  went  in  with  an  infallible  plan  of  campaign.  He 
was  a  character.  Even  in  those  days  he  insisted  on  a  mili- 
tary title,  which  he  derived  from  a  volunteer  regiment ;  and 
when  I  last  saw  him,  twenty  years  ago,  he  informed  me 
that  he  had  cut  commerce  and  was  generalissimo  to  some 
sable  potentate  in  Africa.  He  had  noticed  that  our  long- 
stop  stood  rather  deep,  and  concluded  that  a  stolen  bye 
would  finish  the  match.  It  was  "over"  and  the  bowling 
from  his  end.  William  Armitstead,  long-stop,  crept  in  four 
or  five  yards  nearer  the  wicket  unnoticed  by  the  "  Major," 
and  the  instant  the  ball  had  passed  the  batsman,  away,  as 
he  expected,  started  the  man  at  the  other  end  ;  the  ball 
was  thrown  direct  over  to  the  bowler,  H.  S.  Armitstead, 
who  was  also  on  the  look-out,  and  the  unlucky  batsman 
was  scarcely  half  across  before  his  wicket  was  down. 

Not  long  agt)  V.  K.  Armitage,  a  pretty  good  bat,  men- 
tioned to  Armitstead  that  he  was  the  victim  of  the  "  Major," 
so  had  the  latter  only  played  the  game  the  Western  must 
have  won.  The  ground,  adds  Armitstead,  was  soft,  and 
difficult  to  get  runs  on. 

We  had  a  very  poor  team  for  our  last  match  this  year, 
on  Sept.  20  and  21,  at  Rugby,  against  the  School,  and  only 
scored  39  and  31  to  the  boys'  164.  It  was  here  that  T. 
Ratlifif  (who  had  played  against  us  more  than  once)  first 
figured  in  our  eleven  ;  and  from  this  match  too  began  that 
connection  with  Rugby  School  which  produced  us  so 
many  excellent  recruits.

CHAPTER    IV. 

1859. 

Out  of  fifteen  matches  played  in  1858  we  had  won  ten, 
lost  four,  and  made  a  tie.  This  encouraged  us  to  make 
a  similar  programme  for  1859,  and  we  were  fortunate  in 
being  able  to  add  to  it  a  match  against  I  Zingari,  to  be 
played  on  a  ground  now  forgotten,  "  Parr  and  Wisden's,"  at 
Leamington.     We  began  badly.

17  and  15  ;  A.  Rutter,  5  and  19;  M.  T.  Martin,  18  and  o, 
for  the  School. 

At  Oxford  two  elevens  of  Foresters  engaged  in  a  week's 
cricket,  the  results  being  evenly  divided.  Bullingdon  did 
but  little  against  us  (79  and  53  for  2  wickets),  though 
J.  A.  Pepys  made  26  and  23  (not  out),  J.  Gundry  16  and 
14,  &amp;c.     F.  F.  scored  203 — W.  G.  Armitstead  making  6^^ 


OXFORD.  27 

H.  S.  Armitstead  26,  F.  P.  Onslow  24,  W.  L.  Gresley  16, 
Lord  A.  Paget  14,  &amp;c. 

Christ  Church,  on  June  30,  scored  215,  including  66  from 
J.  Llewelyn,  49  from  E.  G.  Sandford,  24  from  A.  Waller, 

30  from  Herbert  G.  Norman.  Foresters  only  put  up  120 
— W.  G.  Armitstead  28,  F.  Brandt  and  W.  M.  Jervis  16 
each,  H.  S.  Armitstead  15,  H.  S.  Chinn  ii,  T.  Ratliff  10. 
And  on  the  same  day  B.  N.  C.  lost  to  F.  F.  by  169  to  197, 
our  leading  scores  being  E.  Hill  44,  F.  P.  Onslow  and  F. 
H.  Gregory  each  33,  R.  B.  R.  Bedford  23. 

On  July  I  Harlequins  made  179 — G.  L.  Hodgkinson  30, 
C.  D.  Marsham  27,  R.  Parker  and  B.  Wand  each  25,  &amp;c., 
against  a  poor  score  of  74  from.  Foresters.  T.  Ratliff  25, 
being  best ;  E.  G.  Sandford,  A.  H.  Faber,  and  H.  S.  Armit- 
stead the  only  other  double  figures  ;  while  the  other  eleven 
beat  Magdalen,  who  declined  to  give  up  Charles  Ridding 
(F.  F.),  and  offered  A.  B.  Trollope  as  a  substitute.  The 
latter,  playing  for  Foresters,  got  95  (not  out)  in  a  total  of 
173,  against  which  the  College  scored  151,  Ridding  only 
making  13. 

In  the  last  match.  University  College  beat  Foresters  by 
17  runs,  105  to  88 — J.  S.  Dugdale  29,  C.  H.  Gem  18  (not 
out),  and  H.  S.  Chinn  13,  helped  the  modest  score  of  F.  F. 

A  match  at  Trentham  with  the  Staffordshire  Rifles  on 
July  13  was  won  by  Foresters,  though  two  men  short  of 
their  complement.     C.  A.  Garnett  made  49,  H.  S.  Chinn 

31  (not  out),  A.  R.  Kenney  14,  J.  S.  Dugdale  12,  the  total 
being  151.  Garnett  and  Kenney  took  the  Staffordshire 
wickets  for  98 — Capt.  Broughton   16,  the  highest  score. 

On  the  1 6th  July,  at  Coventry,  the  4th  Light  Dragoons 
made  73  and  60  against  164  for  Free  Foresters.  The 
gallant  4th,  says  the  chronicler  of  the  day,  "  exhibited 
in  Lieut,  de  Capel  Broke  (29  and  not  out  24)  a  hero 
superior  to  misfortune.  On  the  part  of  the  Foresters 
Gregory  took   care   not   to   forget  that  "swashing  blow'*

immortalised  by  the  Bard  of  Avon  ("  Romeo  and  Juliet," 
Act  I.)  ;  while  T.  Ratliff,  "  his  foot  upon  his  native  turf," 
contented  himself  with  64  runs  and  14  wickets  as  his 
contribution  to  the  game. 

At  Sutton  Coldfield,  on  Aug.  2,  a  local  twenty-two  of  a 
very  mixed  composition  could  only  realise  64  and  '/6  to 
188  from  Foresters — C.  A.  Garnett  (not  out)  36,  being 
ledger-man  ;  and  on  Aug.  4  Birmingham,  though  assisted 
by  two  professional  players,  only  scored  58  and  52  against 
the  bowling  of  Brandt  and  Goodrich,  Foresters  exceed- 
ing their  total  by  2  runs  in  the  first  innings.  W.  G. 
Armitstead  made  33,  A.  H.  Faber  24,  and  T.  C.  Good- 
rich II. 

On  the  8th  of  Aug.  Free  Foresters  met  I  Zingari  on  the 
Leamington  cricket-ground  mentioned  before.  The  wicket 
was  good,  but  the  weather  left  much  to  be  desired.  Six  of 
our  eleven,  starting  from  Sutton  Coldfield,  found  Birming- 
ham enveloped  in  mist  and  rain,  and  telegraphed  to  know 
if  it  were  any  use  to  come  on.  A  reassuring  reply  being 
received,  they  joined  the  rest  of  the  players,  and  no  posi- 
tive hindrance  from  wet  took  place.  But  the  light  soon 
became  darkness  visible,  and  thence  no  doubt  the  small 
scoring  of  the  first  innings  of  our  opponents.  Foresters 
did  not  show  in  very  formidable  colours,  but  that  such  an 
eleven  as  I  Z.  put  into  the  field  should  be  all  out  for 
30  is  only  to  be  accounted  for  by  atmospheric  influence, 
though  the  F.  F.  fielding  was  quite  faultless.  Brandt  and 
Goodrich  bowled  without  change  on  both  days.

The  remainder  of  the  week  we  utilised  at  Manchester 
(our  diligence  being  much  applauded  by  one  of  our  late 
adversaries,  who  joined  us  forthwith)  by  winning  two 
matches, — the  first  against  the  Western,  assisted  by  R.  C. 
Tinley,  who  with  Brandt  bowled  and  took  all  our  wickets 
for  155.  The  Western  made  72  and  123,  and  we  won  by  9 
wickets — Faber  scoring  19  and  27  (not  out).  Birch  14  and 
20  (not  out),  Goodrich  25,  and  Homfray  21.  Birch,  in  the 
second  innings  of  the  Western,  took  8  wickets.  The 
Manchester  Club,  with  H.  H.  Stephenson,  made  91  and 
146,  on  the  two  following  days  Mr  Perera  44  and  59, 
F.  F.  again  scoring  155  in  their  first  innings,  and  securing 
their  victory  by  8  wickets.     The  first  day  was  partially 


30  CHANGE   OF  SLOWS. 

wet,  so  the  Foresters  had  to  play  against  time  as  well  as  to 
win,  and  hard  hitting  was  in  the  ascendant  the  second  day; 
A.  H.  Faber  made  6i  and  14,  H.  S.  Armitstead  o  and  41 
(not  out),  T.  C.  Goodrich  26  ;  and  he  also  took  10  wickets. 
We  used  to  change  slow  bowlers  a  good  deal  in  those 
days.     Birch  writes  apropos  of  this  : — 

Dear  old  Goodrich,  of  course,  always  started ;  when  he  got  in 
a  tangle  he  used  to  chuck  the  ball  to  me  and  say,  "  Now,  Birch, 
you  have  a  try ; "  and  it  was  curious  how  invariably  the  change 
acted  after  an  over :  then  I  ^  used  to  throw  the  ball  back  to 
Goodrich.  We  often  used  to  wonder  how  it  was  :  he  thought  I 
might  be  a  little  slower ;  my  impression  was  I  delivered  higher 
from  the  hip,  and  the  ball  rose  sharper.  Another  Goodrich  as  a 
■county  man  would,  I  feel  pretty  sure,  reduce  the  big  averages. 
There  is  only  one  good  underhand  bowler,  Humphreys,  who  did 
•capitally  last  year.  Lobs,  as  they  call  them,  are  often  tried,  but 
they  are  mere  rubbish.  It  is  generally  thought  easy  to  bowl 
them,  whereas  it  takes  a  deal  more  to  make  a  Clarke  or  Goodrich 
than  a  good  Catherine-wheeler.  I  wish  I  could  get  a  youngster 
and  coach  him,  but  he  might  lack  the  necessary  brains.  As  a 
beginner,  he  should  not  practise  against  batmen  unless  they  play 
a  defensive  game.  It  is  easy  to  run  out  and  hit  when  chances 
■don't  count.  I  am  convinced  that  the  higher  above  the  hip  the 
ball  can  be  delivered  from  the  better ;  but  it  is  much  more 
•difficult  to  preserve  the  pitch. 

On  August  18  and  19  F.  F.  turned  up  two  short  for  a 
match  at  Southwell  against  Nottinghamshire  County  Club, 
who  were  also  short-handed,  so  nine  a-side  went  in.  A 
good  game  was  won  by  the  Shire,  who  scored  in  their  two 
innings  164  to  the  Foresters'  162.  R.  B.  Earle,  37  and  29, 
was  the  premier  ^or  N.  C.  C.  Goodrich  9  and  43,  Royds 
32  and  ■  2,  C.  A.  Garnett  29  and  5  for  F.  F.  One 
quaint  circumstance  distinguished  this  match.  A  certain 
Free  Forester  fielding  long-leg,  ran  for  a  ball  which  lodged 
in  a  tuft  of  nettles.  "  Mayn't  I  call  lost  ball  ?  "  he  implored. 
•"  Certainly  not,  Frank,  throw  it  in,"  was  the  stern  reply  ;  and 
regardless  of  stings  he  did  retrieve  it,  but  meanwhile  two 
^xtra  runs  had  been  made,  and  this  margin  won  the  match.

SOA^G   OF  THE  SEASON.  31 

We  had  almost  as  close  a  finish  in  a  second  match  with 
Rugby  School,  who  headed  our  score  of  86  by  20  runs  in 
the  first  innings;  but  as  we  made  161  in  the  second  and 
got  them  out  for  1 19,  we  rather  more  than  turned  the  tables, 
and  won  by  22.  For  the  School  —  C.  Booth  29  and  22, 
Bowden  Smith  15  and  28,  A.  Rutter  24  and  10,  M.  T. 
Martin,  6  and  16,  were  conspicuous.  The  brothers  Ratliff 
and  E.  Waller  made  runs  for  Foresters  ;  whose  bowlers 
were  W.  K.  Mott,  T.  RatHff,  Cecil  Plennes,  and  E.  G. 
Sandford. 

Faber's  muse  thus  celebrated  the  heroes  of  the 
season  : — 

Air — "  When  the  Green  Leaves  come  again,'' 

"When  summer's  sun  adorns  the  sky, 

And  April  yields  the  place  to  May  and  June, 
The  birds'  sweet  notes  are  heard  on  high, 

And  half  a  hundred  pulses  beat  in  tune  ;   • 
Forth  from  out  their  cases  bats  and  balls  appear, 

Cricket-shoes  are  worn  instead  of  spurs  ; 

But  of  all  the  clubs  in  this  our  hemisphere. 

Which  can  vie  with  the  Free  Foresters  ? 

Fifty  colours  may  face  the  light  of  day, 

Si7igle^  double^  or  in  triple  rows; 
But  the  red  and gree?i  and  white ^  when  did  hues  unite 
Half  so  free  and  fair  and  fresh  as  those? 

The  central  counties  of  this  isle 

Can  boast  attractions  plentiful  as  flowers  ; 
But  when  were  ladies  found  to  smile 

On  fairer  claims  for  notice  than  on  ours  ? 
In  our  colours  decked,  in  a  jovial  band. 

Seldom  found  to  weary  or  to  yield, 
With  the  agile  foot,  with  the  nimble  hand. 

Full  of  fun  and  chaff  we  take  the  field. 
Fifty  colours  may,  &amp;=€. 

Not  far  from  where  just  now  we  stand, 

This  Club  of  free  companions  took  its  rise  ; 

A  master  mind  its  being  planned. 

And  ladies'  taste  devised  the  triple  dyes. 


32  FABER'S  SONG. 

Long  it  were  to  name  those  its  ranks  that  fill, 
But  one,  at  least,  shall  echo  in  the  strain, 

Noted  far  and  wide — long  may  he  preside  ! 
Long  the  brethren  live  to  entertain  ! 
Fifty  colours  may,  Qr^c. 

With  what  impatience  do  they  arm, 

And  at  the  Rector's  kindly  summons  come, 
And  some  put  up  are  at  'The  Farm,' 

And  at  the  firm  '  Rectorial  Mansion '  some. 
But  where'er  they  go,  or  where'er  they  stay, 

Bodies  in  condition — spirits  light — 
To  the  best  of  games  they  devote  the  day, 

And  to  fun  and  laughter  half  the  night. 
Fifty  colours  may,  &amp;^c. 

And  thence  to  all  the  country  round. 

To  find  and  win  their  matches  they  proceed. 
And  whether  on  their  native  ground 

Or  any  other  central  cricket-mead, 
Still  Frank  the  great,  compelling  clouds,  is  seen, 

Still  Codrington  aquatic  muscle  shows, 
Still  Homfray  with  his  bat  mischief  loves  to  mean. 

And  Jack  to  win,  or  lose,  the  match  with  slows. 
Fifty  colours  may,  &amp;^c. 

Not  less  with  skill  and  science  fraught. 

Old  Goodrich  multiplies  the  mounting  score. 
Adroitly  gets  the  batsmen  caught. 

Or  bowls  him  clean,  or  plants  him  leg  before. 
Lichfield  Chinn  is  there  to  intercept  the  ball. 

And  Edward  Hill  amusement  to  maintain  : 
A  free  and  jovial  lot,  take  them  for  all  in  all. 

We  shan't  soon  look  upon  their  likes  again. 
Fifty  colours  may,  &amp;^c. 


Cricketeering,  laughter-loving  elves, 
A  health  I'll  give  you,  three  times  three, 

With  all  the  honours  drank,  Our  noble  selves. 
Still  when  warm  July  bakes  us  like  a  nut. 

And  half  the  turf  is  brown  for  want  of  rain, 
May  we  all  our  other  engagements  cut. 

And  like  the  green  leaves  come  again.

CHAPTER    V. 

i860. 

We  had  now  arrived  at  the  position  of  being  able  to 
essay  the  high  emprises  which  my  sanguine  hopes  had  long 
foreshadowed,  but  it  was  perhaps  as  well  that  we  deferred 
the  realisation  of  our  more  ambitious  programme  until 
1 861  ;  for  the  summer  of  i860  was  a  damp  imposture,  and 
our  book  for  that  year  is  one  melancholy  record  of  rain.  It 
might  be  said  of  the  clerk  of  the  weather  as  of  the  tyrant 
of  old— 

"  As  long  as  he  could  reign  he  reigned, 
And  then — he  mizzled  ! " 

Rugby  School  on  May  14  and  15,  having  got  F.  F.  out 
for  157,  secured  a  lead  of  80  runs,  and  got  4  wickets  down 
for  82,  when  wet  stopped  the  game.  A.  E.  Tennant  83, 
S.  Linton  47,  E.  Rutter  29,  F.  R.  Evans  14,  M.  T.  Martin 
II,  were  the  double  figures  for  the  School.  For  F.  F. 
E.  G.  Sandford  4  (not  out)  and  52,  and  T.  Ratlifif  33  and 
8,  are  worth  a  note. 

On  June  4  and  5  University  Coll.  beat  F.  F.  terribly 
at  Oxford,  making  no  and  133  to  48  and  93  for  F.  F., 
Hilton,  Hinchliffe,  H.  S.  Armitstead,  T.  Ratliff,  and  G. 
Phillips  being  the  best  scorers.  Harlequins  again  made 
106  to  27  only  from  F.  F.,  who  in  their  second  innings  had 
scored  135  for  6  wickets  when  wet  caused  the  game  to  be

drawn.     F.  G.  Inge  made  o  and  39  (not  out),  A.  H.  Faber 
5  and  40,  H.  S.  Armitstead  8  and  28,  &amp;c. 

On  June  6  and  7  (the  Same  days)  another  Forester 
eleven  drew  their  match  with  B.  N.  C,  who  made  131  and 
129,  to  F.  F.  113,  Hinchliffe  scoring  28,  Mott  24,  Codrington 
1 1  (not  out). 

On  June  9  Foresters  did  manage  a  win  against  Bul- 
lingdon,  getting  lOO  to  68  and  78.  BuUingdon  had  their 
professional,  Slinn,  to  bowl  for  them.  For  Foresters  Chinn 
took  9  wickets,  C.  A.  Garnett  8  ;  the  latter  scored  21  runs, 
G.  H.  Philips  18,  T.  Hilton  14,  H.  S.  Armitstead  and 
C.  Horwood  13  each.  A  h'Ural  colncidGnce  occurs  in  the 
score  of  this  match — viz.,  Slinn  c  and  b  Chinn  ;  Chinn  c 
and  b  Slinn. 

A  win  over  the  nth  Hussars  at  Sutton  Coldfield  on 
July  4  was  almost  snatched  from  our  grasp  by  bad 
weather.  The  regiment  scored  50,  F.  F.  yy  ;  G.  A.  E. 
Kempson  23,  H.  S.  Chinn  12,  and  T.  O.  Reay  10,  the 
double  figures. 

July  10  to  13  were  devoted  to  a  campaign  in  Shrop- 
shire, productive  at  the  moment  of  signal  discomfiture, 
but  as  its  result  bringing  into  our  ranks  more  than  one 
of  our  very  best  recruits.  Shrewsbury,  who  won  with  8 
wickets  to  fall,  got  235,  and  made  Free  Foresters  follow 
their  innings.  Shropshire  had  playing  for  them  W.  Wing- 
field,  a  pocket-Hercules,  who  had  steered  the  Cambridge 
boat  in  the  races  against  Oxford  of  1855  ^.nd  1856,  who 
in  this  match  made  84  and  15,  both  times  not  out.  Free 
Foresters,  who  made  95  and  178,  were  indebted  to  G.  S. 
Homfray  25  and  55,  G.  Arkwright  23  and  11,  E.  K. 
Hornby  10  and  25,  H.  S.  Armitstead  2  ^^^  25,  for  most 
of  their  runs.  Probably  bowling  was  here  our  weak  point ; 
one  incident  at  any  rate  may  be  cited  as  a  proof.  When 
Wingfield  had  been  in  for  a  considerable  space  of  time, 
and  treated  each  change  of  bowling  with  increasing  dis-

respect,  one  of  our  team  suggested  that  when  he  had 
been  in  the  Rugby  eleven  he  bowled  slows,  and  accord- 
ingly he  was  tried  for  an  over.  The  moment  he  began 
the  field  were  in  convulsions  of  suppressed  laughter, 
for  he  simply  chucked  up  a  ball  to  hit,  without  length, 
twist,  pace,  or  anything  likely  to  take  a  wicket  about 
it.  The  batsman,  however  (not  Wingfield),  evidently 
detected  some  deep  design  in  this  simplicity,  and  played 
all  the  four  balls  of  that  over  with  the  utmost  caution, 
and  v/ithout  a  run  ;  our  new  bowler  was  cock-a-hoop,  and 
insisted  on  another  trial.  Unluckily  for  him  he  had 
Wingfield  to  bowl  at  this  time,  who  promptly  deposited 
the  first  ball  in  the  Severn,  which  flowed  by  the  cricket- 
field.  The  ball  was  not  lost,  for  a  man  with  a  punt  was 
on  the  look-out  for  such  contingencies,  but  we  did  not 
indulge  Royds  with  a  third  over.  At  Ludlow  again  we 
were  beaten  by  52  runs — W.  Wingfield  not  out  twice 
more,  with  66  and  42  ;  and  a  Mr  Taylor  bowling  most 
of  our  wickets  for  small  scores, — H.  S.  Armitstead  28 
and  I,  and  E.  K.  Hornby  17  and  18,  the  best.  This 
eleven,  however,  had  the  honour  of  being  handed  down 
to  immortality  in  the  verses  of  a  witty  opponent,  Benson, 
whose  initials,  R.  A.  B.,  are  appended  to  some  of  the  best 
society  rhymes  in  the  early  numbers  of  'Once  a- Week,' 
and  who  was  as  good  at  a  hustings  speech  as  he  was 
at  a  cricket  rhyme. 

"  How  shall  I  sing  these  Foresters  so  free, 
Too  bad  for  Salop,  p'raps  too  good  for  we,^ 
Led  by  three  Jacks,  '  United  though  Untied,' 
Loose  in  their  hitting,  in  their  bowling  wide. 
Spoilt  child  of  fame,  on  conquest's  glowing  track, 
A  middling  player  comes,  the  '  middle  Jack.' 
Two  loving  brothers  in  his  wake  pursue,

The  *  old '  to  take  the  lead  upon  the  score, 
The  '  young '  to  chatter  when  the  game  is  o'er. 
Next  to  my  vision  Jerry  comes  'on  slow' 
(The  tucked-up  trouser  now  seems  all  the  go) ; 
A  '  quidnunc '  champion  too  before  me  steps, 
"With  small  ambition,  but  with  large  biceps  ; 
A  dread  form  now  disturbs  my  fevered  brain 
The  mighty  Homfray  slogging  o'er  the  plain, 
Performing  feats  that  strike  the  foe  with  dread, 
And  putting  bowlers  over  their  own  head, 
A  point — not  Euclid's  point — I  next  must  sing, 
For  parts  and  magnitude  their  point  can  bring  ; 
His  hitting  brilliant,  though  his  life  not  long, 
Like  David,  ruddy,  and,  like  Samson,  strong. 
A  late  Harrovian  at  short-leg  I  spy. 
His  batting  steady,  his  delivery  high  ; 
And  Hill  (I  might  go  farther  and  fare  worse) 
Winds  up  the  tale  of  wickets  and  of  verse. 

P.S. — Must  I,  to  make  my  epic  true, 
Too  kind  emergencies,  descant  on  you. 
That  Stone  on  which,  to  condescend  to  tropes. 
At  long  field-on  they  founded  all  their  hopes. 
And  Morris,  by  whose  too  tenacious  grip, 
Poor  Mr  Taylor  perished  in  the  slip, 
Ah,  yes  !  their  names  upon  my  song  I'd  see — 
They  let  me  off,  and  that's  enough  for  me." 

The  three  Armitsteads  are  of  course  Jack.  Francis 
Onslow's  sobriquet  was  Jerry.  The  "quidnunc"  is  Royds, 
the  "  point "  Codrington,  and  the  "  Harrovian  "  Hornby, 
an  excellent  bat,  who  played  a  great  deal  for  Foresters  in 
future,  as  did  Wingfield  also. 

July  19  and  20  saw  two  Free  Forester  engagements 
fulfilled  :  one  in  Notts,  where  the  gentlemen  of  the  county 
scored  181  and  149,  R.  B.  Earle  72  and  37,  against  Fores- 
ters' 132,  and  92  for  2  wickets  ;  F.  G.  Inge  scoring  43  and 
24,  T,  Rathfif  13  and  44,  G.  S.  Homfray  28  and  18  (not 
out),  F.  Brandt  19  and  2  (not  out).  The  last-mentioned 
took   10  wickets.     C.  A.  Garnett  and  Ratliff  also  bowled. 

The  other  match,  in  Cheshire,  against  the  84th  Regi- 


IV.  G.  a:s  slows.  37 

ment,  was  won  by  F.  F.,  who  made  159,  E.  K.  Hornby 
claiming  66,  H.  S.  Armitstead  18.  The  officers  only  scored 
50  and  15,  W.  G.  Armitstead  with  lobs  taking  12  wickets. 
His  bowling  must  have  been  just  at  this  time  somewhat 
deadly,  for  in  our  next  match  at  Leamington,  July  28,  he 
took  all  the  wickets  of  Deddington,  including  W.  and  C 
Fiennes,  for  49,  and  as  we  had  made  144,  and  Deddington 
had  to  follow  their  innings,  the  not-out  man  fell  to  him 
also  without  another  run  being  obtained.  T.  Ratliff  was 
our  best  scorer,  making  61. 

Against  a  twenty-two  of  Sutton  Coldfield,  including  W. 
K.  Mott  and  H.  S.  Chinn,  Foresters  only  scored  y6,  of 
which  W.  G.  Armitstead  claimed  43  (not  out);  but  as  Good- 
rich and  Brandt  disposed  of  the  twenty-two  for  32  and  65 
runs.  Foresters  won  by  10  wickets.  Goodrich  annexed  no 
less  than  24  wickets,  of  which  11  were  ciphers.  Brandt 
disposed  of  1 1. 

The  two  next  days,  Aug.  6  and  7,  we  should  have  beaten 
Lord  Lichfield's  team  at  Shugborough  Park,  but  for  rain, 
having  got  174  to  the  home  side's  64,  and  32  for  5  wickets. 
Goodrich  took  6  wickets,  and  made  30  runs,  H.  S.  Armit- 
stead 45. 

Our  Manchester  matches,  Aug.  13  to  15,  were  not  quite 
so  interesting  as  usual,— the  original  programme  having 
fallen  through.  The  Western,  with  two  professionals, 
Wright  and  Rowland,  were  beaten  rather  easily  in  one 
innings  by  17  runs,  Foresters  making  123,  and  getting 
their  antagonists  out  for  74  and  32  ;  Brandt,  Goodrich, 
and  Arkwright  bowling.  Homfray  scored  33,  Hornby 
and  Goodrich  each  24,  Arkwright  14.  On  the  other  side 
played  a  Rossal  schoolboy,  F.  W.  Wright,  soon  to  be  one 
of  our  best  recruits ;  he  was  run  out  twice  for  small  scores. 
The  84th  Regiment  tfcen  had  another  essay,  but  only 
made  53  and  41,  Goodrich's  slows  taking  8  of  their  wickets 
and  W.  Armitstead's  6;  while  Foresters  claimed  117  and

199— W.  Wingfield  55  and  13,  T.  Ratliff  i  and  51,  W.  G. 
Armitstead  4  and  30,  A.  F.  Payne  o  and  35,  T.  C.  Good- 
rich 15  and  14.  H.  Arkwright  obtained  13  Forester 
wickets. 

On  Aug.  20  and  21,  at  Warrington,  a  match  v.  Gentle- 
men of  Cheshire  was  momentous,  as  introducing  to  our 
ranks  another  young  player  of  consummate  value  in  our 
after  -  engagements.  I  had  observed  that  in  a  match, 
"  Twenty  -  two  of  Walsall  against  the  United  England 
Eleven,"  an  Eton  boy,  the  Hon.  C.  G.  Lyttelton,  had  kept 
one  end  up  during  the  whole  game,  bowling  8  wickets,  in 
which  were  included  those  of  Griffith,  Caffyn,  Lockyer, 
Wisden,  and  Carpenter,  and  getting  runs  as  well.  I  was 
fortunate  enough  to  induce  him  to  go  down  and  qualify 
for  our  Club,  in  which  I  need  hardly  say  his  family  name 
has  become  "  a  household  word."  Otherwise  the  match  was 
not  interesting,  the  Cheshire  side  only  making  74  and 
40,  and  Foresters  119;  of  which  W.  G.  Armitstead  and 
Hornby,  playing  for  their  club  against  their  county,  made 
25  and  52  respectively.     Goodrich  took  11  wickets. 

A  ludicrously  ea§y  victory  over  a  Birmingham  eleven  on 
Sept.  24  concluded  the  season,  the  opponents  only  scoring 
25  runs,  which  Kempson  doubled  off  his  own  bat,  the  total 
of  Free  Foresters  being  204.

CHAPTER    VI. 
1861. 

We  had  not  enlarged  our  programme  very  much  during 
the  last  two  seasons,  but  we  had  felt  our  way.  I  began  to 
see  the  dawn  of  my  ambitious  schemes  on  the  horizon  of 
practicability,  and  for  the  season  of  1 861  was  able  to  obtain 
a  fixture  at  Lord's  v.  M.  C.  C,  and  against  the  United  Eng- 
land eleven  with  sixteen  at  Manchester.  We  also  found 
that  the  best  Midland  bowler,  David  Buchanan,  was  pre- 
pared to  enter  into  friendly  relations  with  our  confederacy 
with  a  view  of  joining  it — a  matter  most  important  to  our 
future  prospects. 

For  a  wonder  Free  Foresters  lost  their  first  match,  May 
28,  to  Bullingdon,  who  played  two  bowlers,  Shaw  and 
Hinckley,  rather  too  good  for  the  F.  F.  batsmen  ;  in  the 
first  innings  W.  K.  Mott  12,  being  the  only  double  figure, 
and  the  total  37.  Against  this,  with  the  aid  of  a  good  59 
from  J.  A.  Pepys,  Bullingdon  got  147,  and  F.  F.,  with  5 
wickets  down,  responded  with  82,  Reay  scoring  26  and 
Faber  19.  They  won  their  other  game  against  B.  N.  C, 
making  98  and  149  to  123  and  96  from  the  College.  C.  A. 
Garnett  took  11  wickets,  W.  K.  Mott  7.  A.  H.  Faber  31 
and  14,  G.  H.  Phillips  o  and  46,  H.  E.  Hulton  10  and  20, 
R.  Brodie  11  and  18,  C.  A.  Garnett  17  and  12,  were  the 
principal  contributors  to  the  Foresters'  score. 

At  Rugby,  on  June  3  and  4,  "a  rainy  influence  gave  a 


40 


M.  c.  a 


predominance  each  day  to  batting  over  fielding  and  bowl- 
ing." The  School  got  132  and  134,  with  5  wickets  down. 
Her  champions  were  C.  Booth  63  and  19,  E.  Rutter  20 
and  24,  C.  Marshall  6  and  54  (not  out),  F.  R.  Evans  7  and 
26  (not  out)  ;  Reay,  Mott,  and  T.  Ratliff  took  the  wickets. 
For  F.  F.  the  last-named  scored  34  and  26,  W.  G.  Armit- 
stead  8  and  57,  W.  Ratliff  20  (not  out)  and  21,  C.  Inge 
15  and  14  (retired),  T.  O.  Reay  9  and  31,  W.  K.  Mott  25 
and  5.  The  totals  were  148  and  193,  against  the  bowling 
of  Rutter,  Hood,  Evans,  and  Robertson. 

The  match  at  Lord's  was  played  on  Thursday  in  Ascot 
week,  with  a  gallery  of  perhaps  fifty  spectators,  but  the 
cricket  was  good,  and  the  '  Field '  was  kind  enough  to  say, 
"on  the  part  of  the  Foresters  especially  so."  In  this 
match  the  original  constitution  of  the  Society  as  a  Mid- 
land Club  suffered  its  first  innovation,  for  F.  G.  Inge 
having  met  with  an  accident  on  the  eve  of  the  match, 
E.  Hume,  a  Sussex  man,  played  for  him,  and  was  there- 
upon elected  a  member.

From  July  \y  to  20  Foresters  visited  Manchester  and 
Liverpool.  The  Western,  at  the  former  city,  scored  253 
and  no,  Mr  Chinn's  slows  —  which  one  of  the  critics 
asserted  he  fielded  himself  at  cover-point — being  the 
feature  of  the  game.  He  also  made  49  (not  out)  out  of 
the  199  total  of  Free  Foresters — Capt.  Blane  33,  H.  E. 
Hulton  35,  and  W.  K.  Mott  22,  assisting.  At  Liverpool 
Mr  Horner  led  off  with  75  (not  out)  out  of  an  innings  of 
144,  to  which  Foresters  responded  with  186 — Hornby  52, 
Price  38,  Mott  19.  Against  this  Liverpool  only  put  on  89, 
Brandt  bowling  89  balls  for  49  runs  and  6  wickets,  while 


42  A    CHANCE. 

Mott  bowled  ^S  balls  for  36  runs  and  3  wickets ;  so 
Foresters  won  with  the  loss  of  only  two  batsmen,  W.  J. 
Lyon  being,  not  out,  20.  I  was  scoring,  as  I  often  found 
myself  doing,  during  the  match  at  Liverpool,  when  I 
observed  my  colleague  making  mysterious  dots  and 
scratches  over  some  of  his  figures.  "  What  does  that 
mean  ?  "  I  asked  at  length,  my  curiosity  being  thoroughly 
awakened.  "  A  chance,  sir,"  was  the  polite  reply.  I  held 
my  peace  until  a  flukey  hit  some  twenty  yards  beyond 
long-off  was  "  starred  "  as  before.  "How  could  that  be  a 
chance?"  said  I,  "when  there  was  no  man  there."  "Ah, 
but  there  might  have  been,"  was  the  rejoinder. 

At  Leamington,  July  30,  Deddington  scored  95  to  103 
from  Free  Foresters,  who  had  made  81  for  4  wickets  in 
their  second  innings — W.  K.  Mott  23  and  16,  H.  C.  Willes 
20  and  24  (not  out),  C.  G.  Lyttelton  21  and  17,  and  M.  T. 
Martin  13  and  14  (not  out),  distinguishing  themselves 
against  the  bowling  of  E.  Ramsay  and  T.  E.  Cobb. 

Two  days  later,  at  Southwell, 

the  F.  F.  Administration,  said  '  Bell's  Life,'  met  with  a  fierce 
Opposition  on  the  part  of  the  country  gentlemen  of  Notts.  The 
struggle  was  a  severe  one,  the  debate  lasting  till  the  evening  of 
the  second  day ;  but  in  spite  of  the  exertions  of  the  Opposition 
whipper-in  the  country  gentlemen  were  beaten  by  the  Ministry 
by  a  majority  of  77.  The  ability  of  Mr  Goodrich  and  Mr  Brandt 
was  very  conspicuous  during  the  debate,  and  though  Mr  Boden 
spoke  with  much  emphasis  for  the  country  party,  his  voice  carried 
little  or  no  weight  with  it.  It  is  hoped  that  the  motion  will  be 
an  annual  one,  and  the  Secretary  for  the  Home  Department  has 
promised  to  grant  a  day  for  the  purpose  in  the  ensuing  session  of 
18.62,  when  he  hopes  that  Mr  Faber  will  again  catch  the  Speaker's 
eye  and  occupy  the  House  for  a  couple  of  hours.

Brandt  29  and  3,  W.  G.  Armitstead  4  and  15,  R.  T.  Whit- 
tington  4  and  13.     Goodrich  took  7  wickets,  Brandt  8. 

At  Sutton  Coldfield,  on  Aug.  6,  a  local  twenty,  including 
a  famous  old  University  cricketer,  Herbert  Peel,  were  dis- 
posed of  by  Goodrich  (12  wickets)  and  Brandt  (5)  for  38 
runs ;  but  Foresters,  who  had  only  eight  men  to  go  in, 
found  Peel's  bowling  unexpectedly  puzzling,  and  but  for  a 
good  innings  of  80  (not  out)  from  C.  A.  Garnett,  who  gave 
a  splendid  object  lesson  on  the  art  of  leg-hitting,  would 
scarcely  have  won.  Fourteen  Sutton  wickets  had  fallen 
in  the  second  innings  for  64^9  to  Goodrich  and  4  to 
Brandt,  G.  D.  Perkins   14,  the  only  double  figure. 

An  easy  victory  was  obtained  on  Aug.  10  at  Leam- 
ington, F.  F.  scoring  217,  of  which  T.  Ratliff  put  on  62, 
R.  Brodie  29,  A.  H.  Faber  and  Reginald  Garnett  26  each, 
against  6j  from  Leamington. 

On  the  1 2th  and  13th  Aug., 

"  With  stern  resolve,  furled  flag,  and  muffled  drum, 
To  Severn's  shores  the  '  nomad  Woodmen '  come, 
And  by  that  stream  where  erst  their  colours  dipped, 
Their  quondam  conquerors  they  soundly  whipped." 

This  was  the  Forester  retort  to  a  local  poet  who  had  cele- 
brated, their  defeat  at  Shrewsbury  the  year  before  : — 

"  Fling  the  green  flag  upon  the  breeze,  and  blazon  far  and  wide 
The  legend  of  the  Foresters — '  United  though  Untied.' 
Ah  me  !  the  banner's  silken  fold  is  drooping  on  the  plain, 
In  the  glory  of  its  coming  it  returneth  not  again." 

In  fact,  Free  Foresters  having  made  a  good  beginning 
with  181 — 45  from  Faber,  24  apiece  from  C.  G.  Lyttelton 
and  H.  S.  Armitstead,  and  21  apiece  from  Brodie  and 
Fiennes — by  the  aid  of  Brandt,-  Fiennes,  and  Lyttelton, 
prevented  the  two  essays  of  Salop  from  equalling  their 
single  total,  getting  them  out  for  96  and  64. 

At  Ludlow,  on  the  two  days  following,  the  game  was 


44  HONORARY  MEMBERS. 

drawn  in  favour  of  the  local  eleven,  who  had  lost  only 
4  wickets,  and  were  31  runs  behind — H.  S.  Armitstead 
and  W.  Fiennes  were  playing  for  Ludlow,  who  scored 
224.     Foresters  255. 

The  interest  in  such  contests  as  the  last  mentioned  is 
ephemeral ;  but  the  Club  was  now  to  test  by  experience 
the  practicability  of  an  attempt  not  at  that  time  supposed 
to  be  within  the  powers  of  any  amateur  clubs  except  the 
Universities — to  meet  without  paid  bowlers  one  of  the 
England  elevens.  By  the  kind  offices  of  our  old  friends, 
the  Western  Club,  Manchester,  whose  secretary,  Mr 
Hampson,  became  one  of  our  first  honorary  associates, 
we  were  enabled  to  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for 
bringing  our  experiment  to  a  decision  at  Eccles  on  the 
ground  of  the  Club,  of  which  for  the  nonce  we  were 
installed  as  honorary  members,  enabling  us  to  order  such 
refreshments  as  we  required,  and  to  use  the  pavilion  ;  but 
as  such  an  arrangement  was  not  possible  with  the  players' 
eleven,  a  room  was  assigned  to  them,  and  their  refresh- 
ments were  franked.  I  could  not  help  being  diverted, 
when  on  the  first  morning  Cafifyn  came  up  to  the  bar  for 
a  glass  of  beer,  and  asked,  "  What's  to  pay  ?  "  *'  Nothing, 
sir,"  replied  the  barmaid.  "  Thank  ye,  miss,"  was  the 
prompt  reply  ;  "  then  I'll  take  another !  "  The  United 
played  strong,  as  Hayward,  the  great  A.  E.  E.  batsman, 
was  included  in  their  eleven,  as  was  an  excellent  Man- 
chester amateur,  Mr  Bousfield. 

Some  members  of  the  Free  Forester  team  being  com- 
pelled at  the  last  moment  to  absent  themselves,  in  the 
place  of  two  of  them  we  obtained  the  services  of  a  brace 
of  clever  substitutes,  Messrs  E.  Rowley  and  V.  K. 
Armitage.  Beginning  rather  late  the  first  day,  Good- 
rich obtained  3  wickets  and  Buchanan  i  for  23  runs, 
Hayward  and  Wisden  took  up  the  score  to  85  for  the 
fifth  wicket,  and  the  former  player  was  in  with  Mortlock 


U.  E.  E.  45 

at  the  call  of  time — 123  runs  being  registered  for  7 
wickets.  The  amusing  incident  of  the  day  was  that 
Bell,  a  Cambridge  pro.,  invented  what  the  Manchester 
cricket  reporter  called  a  "  fancy  stroke "  to  Goodrich, 
running  out  and  trying  to  lift  his  ball  over  the  wicket. 
He  missed  it,  however,  and  it  took  his  bails.  On  the 
second  day,  Goodrich  caught  and  bowled  Hayward  for 
65,  and  the  innings  totalled  163.  Atkinson,  a  Yorkshire 
bowler,  was  particularly  deadly,  and  but  for  a  timely 
stand  of  W.  G.  Armitstead,  who  got  30  by  some  hard 
drives  and  really  fine  cuts,  Foresters  would  have  figured 
badly;  as  it  was,  they  just  failed  to  score  100.  It  is 
worth  a  mention  that  Armitstead  complained  that  he 
could  not  see  Atkinson's  hand  against  the  body  of  the 
umpire ;  and  that  functionary  was  in  consequence  in- 
vested with  a  white  garment, — a  thing  which  I  at  least 
for  one  had  never  seen  before.  In  the  second  inningrs 
of  the  United,  Buchanan's  luck  was  crushing,  as  he  did 
not  get  a  single  wicket,  though  bowling  admirably.  The 
eleven  were  not  out  until  the  third  morning,  and  the 
question  was  whether  time  would  allow  them  to  win. 
In  fact,  at  luncheon-time,  with  4  Forester  wickets  down 
for  40  runs,  it  looked  very  like  a  draw ;  but  the  United 
eleven  thought  that  they  might  make  a  win  of  it,  and 
when  Atkinson  changed  ends  more  life  was  infused  into 
the  game.  Faber  and  Inge,  H.  S.  Armitstead  and  Colley, 
all  scored  freely,  and  finally,  at  little  more  than  five 
minutes  to  time,  Harry  Willes  and  V.  K.  Armitage  ran 
the  winning  run.

Close  and  interesting  as  this  match  was,  it  was  followed 
by  a  finish  more  sensational,  and  a  match  more  fluctuating 
in  its  progress.  We  played  on  the  29th  and  30th  the 
Broughton  Club,  the  only  Manchester  eleven  we  had  not 
beaten,  reputed  to  be  the  strongest  of  the  three  Man- 
chester teams.  It  was  a  bowler's  wicket,  and  they  got 
F.  F.  out  for  89,  leading  by  20  runs  when  their  turn  came. 
Our  second  innings  produced  127  (the  fifth  wicket  having 
fallen  for  103)  ;  thus  Broughton  went  in  for  107  to  win. 
Buchanan  began  splendidly  ;  5  wickets  fell  to  him  and  i 
to  Goodrich  for  44  runs,  and  then  E.  Rowley  (who  scored 
48  and  60  not  out)  broke  the  bowling,  and  Brandt  having 
been  disabled  the  day  before,  we  had  no  change  to  fall 
back  upon  but  H.  S.  Armitstead,  who  did  us  yeoman's 
service,  sending  up  24  balls  for  4  runs,  and  enabling  the 
original  bowlers  to  come  on  again.  At  97  Goodrich  took 
the  seventh  wicket,  the  next  fell  for  the  same  score,  and 
then  the  ninth  man  went  in  determined  to  do  or  die.  I 
cannot  recall  his  name,  but  I  see  him  yet,  a  huge  slogger, 
tucking  up  his  sleeves  as  he  went  to  the  wicket.  Goodrich 
gave  him  a  ball  to  hit,  up  it  went  straight  into  Wing- 
field's  hands — who  dropped  it.  The  thunder  of  suppressed 
enthusiasm  burst  forth  from  every  quarter  of  the  ground, 
and  the  few  backers  of  the  Foresters  changed  colour  and 
drew  a  long  breath.  Goodrich  never  moved  a  muscle.  He 
gave  him  the  same  ball,  and  it  went  to  the  same  place,  but 
with  a  different  result,  for  Wingfield  held  it  this  time.  The 
last  man  was  a  slow  bowler,  and  had  rather  ill  -  treated 
Buchanan,  who  had  his  revenge  by  bowling  him  neck  and

heels.  So  Foresters  won  by  6.  A.  H.  Faber  34  and  28, 
F.  G.  Inge  7  and  30,  W.  Wingfield  17  and  10,  T.  C.  Good- 
rich 4  and  18,  made  most  runs. 

And  in  their  last  match  with  Rugby  School  they  won 
again  with  small  margin  of  time.  It  was  played  on  Sept. 
9  and  10,  F.  F.  getting  160  runs  in  the  first  innings,  of 
which  T.  Ratliff  contributed  70.  The  School  got  86,  and 
disposed  of  F.  F.  for  59  runs  only,  and  then  succumbed  for 
6Z, — Goodrich  (who  took  9  wickets),  Buchanan,  and  Mott 
being  the  F.  F.  bowlers.  B.  B.  Cooper  with  42  and  10  (not 
out)  championed  the  School.  I  shall  never  forget  the  not- 
out  innings,  played  for  time  with  a  patience  and  dexterity 
which  would  have  been  remarkable  in  a  veteran.  He  went 
in  second  or  third  wicket  down,  and  was  in  while  Martin 
made  35  and  Davenport  ii.  He  soon  became  one  of 
our  most  reliable  batsmen. 

This  was  the  seventieth  match  played  by  Free  Fores- 
ters, who  felt  themselves  not  unworthy  to  be  classed  with 
the  "wandering  tribes  represented  by  I  Zingari,  whose 
amateur  performances  in  the  evening  are  equal  to  their 
prowess  in  the  morning  ;  the  Perambulators,  whose  motto 
is  *  Floreant  Vehicula ' ;  the  Ramblers,  who  are  never  with- 
out *  Spectators ' ;  the  Toxophilites,  who  are  as  expert  at 
the  wicket  as  they  are  at  the  bull's-eye,  and  who  quiver  not 
before  their  opponents  ;  the  Free  Foresters,  who,  like  Robin 
Hood  and  his  merry  men  of  old,  bear  off  the  palm  for  skill, 
pluck,  and  determination  ;  the  Suffolk  Borderers,"  &amp;c.^

CHAPTER    VII. 
1862. 

Free  Foresters  began  their  season  as  usual  at  Oxford, 
on  May  27,  getting  Bullingdon  out  for  52, — Mott,  Reay^ 
and  W.  G.  Armitstead  bowling  ;  and  the  last-named  with  37 
aiding  H.  Boden  39,  and  J.  B.  Story  27,  in  the  compilation 
of  a  score  of  132,  with  6  wickets  to  fall.  Brasenose  on  the 
two  next  days  made  a  draw.  F.  F.  scored  168  and  179 — 
W.  G.  Armitstead  62  and  42,  C.  A.  Garnett  55  and  3,  A. 
H.  Faber  i  and  46,  &amp;c. — to  133  from  the  College. 

A  third  match  at  a  village  called  Buckland,  on  a  ground 
full  of  molehills,  and  in  rain  which,  as  Hood  once  said, 
"  came  from  watering-pots  with  the  rose  off,"  was  attempted 
on  May  30,  and  part  of  an  innings  was  got  through,  For- 
esters' score  being  78,  of  which  39  were  extras,  24  being 
wides  from  Colonel  Goodlake,  fast  underhand.  W.  G. 
Armitstead  scored  16.  Four  wickets  of  the  Kingston 
eleven  scored  27,  Lord  Turnour  12  (not  out). 

There  was  yet  more  rain  at  Rugby,  June  3  and  4,  where 
the  boys  made  a  fine  innings  of  248 — Robertson  70,  Case 
53,  Cooper  35,  Vandermeulen  27  ;  and  6  Forester  wickets 
were  down  for  88,  T.  Ratlifif  38.  And  although  a  month 
had  elapsed  before  their  next  engagement,  the  vengeful 
clerk  of  the  weather  still  dogged  their  steps.  It  was  at 
Southgate — the  first  time  F.  F.  had  the  pleasure  of  visiting 
a  ground  sacred  to  Middlesex  cricket,  where  they  have

played  many  a  good  match  since  ;  and  with  Hearne  IJ,  E. 
Vyse  31,  and  C.  Waller  28,  the  home  team  compiled  152 
against  35,  which  time  and  weather  only  allowed  F.  F.  to 
score  for  the  loss  of  4  wickets.  Mott's  performance  with 
the  ball  was  unusually  good — 114  balls  for  30  runs  and  5 
wickets ;  Goodrich  bowled  '^'^  balls  for  50  runs  and  2 
wickets,  and  Buchanan  80  for  42  runs  and  i  wicket,  Brandt 
also  securing  one.  Mott  always  was  a  valuable  bowler, 
though  in  general  we  used  to  utilise  his  services  as  a 
change  for  a  few  overs  only.  He  took  a  remarkably  long 
run,  and  we  used  to  think  soon  tired.  He  rather  resented 
this  estimate  of  his  powers,  and  I  well  remember,  when  he 
went  to  a  curacy  in  Devonshire,  asking  him  how  he  was 
getting  on.  "  Splendidly,"  was  his  reply  ;  "  I  am  appreci- 
ated at  last.  They  flock  to  hear  me  preach,  and  put  me 
on  first  to  bowl  for  the  county." 

A  weak  team  of  Free  Foresters  had  to  succumb  in  one 
innings  on  July  8  to  the  School  at  Weybridge,  to  which 
Goodrich  had  transferred  his  services.  The  School  got 
128 — W.  C.  Tabor  60;  and  Goodrich  took  15  wickets  of 
Foresters,  who  only  made  59  and  43. 

The  following  days  saw  Free  Foresters  at  the  Oval  to 
play  a  team  of  Gentlemen  of  Surrey,  supplemented  by  two 
ground  men,  Humphrey  and  Heartfield.  The  feature  of 
the  match  was  W.  G.  Armitstead's  admirably  got  score  of 
116;  but  our  new  recruit,  B.  B.  Cooper,  took  6  wickets  with 
his  slows,  and  C.  G.  Lyttelton,  though  failing  to  add  to  the 
score,  disposed  of  as  many  at  wicket.

52  A    TIE. 

In  the  same  week,  July  12,  the  Club  made  their  second 
tie  match,  Wimbledon  being  the  locality.  It  was  essen- 
tially a  bowlers'  day.  B.  B.  Cooper  took  16  Wimbledon 
wickets  and  won  his  hat,  the  home  side  only  reaching  the 
totals  of  41  and  91.  But  Foresters  did  no  better  ;  they 
got  54  in  the  first  innings,  and  Walter  Coyney  was  run 
out  by  a  substitute  when  attempting  the  winning-notch. 
Oliver  captured  12  Forester  wickets,  those  who  got  into 
double  figures  being  Faber,  Wingfield,  W.  G.  Armitstead, 
and  Pocklington  (twice). 

A  fortnight  later  our  most  important  engagement  came 
off  at  Leamington,  where  we  met  the  old  All  England 
eleven  with  sixteen ;  the  ground  being  the  one  owned 
by  Parr  and  Wisden.  Imagine  the  consternation  of  the 
writer  when  at  his  breakfast-table  that  morning  he  received 
a  missive  from  Buchanan  announcing  that,  in  consequence 
of  what  was  once  called  in  the  letter  of  a  waiting-gentle- 
woman a  dishion  to  his  family,  he  could  not  come  to  play. 
Fortunately  Wingfield  Fiennes  was  accessible,  and  sup- 
plied the  vacancy.  The  score  will  give  a  good  idea  of  the 
game,  which  nevertheless  abounded  in  incident  from  com- 
mencement to  close.  The  eleven  included  Capt.  F.  Mar- 
shall, and  was  as  formidable  a  batting  team  as  could  be 
found :  95  for  2  wickets  was  the  score  at  dinner-time,  and 
the  England  eleven  were  out  for  227,  and  had  got  2 
Forester  wickets  for  13  at  the  end  of  the  day.  Faber, 
however,  was  treated  very  leniently  at  wicket  by  H.  H. 
Stephenson,  and  Wingfield  played  excellent  cricket,  carry- 
ing out  his  bat  for  20,  having  W.  Fiennes  in  with  him  for  a 
rattling  31,  while  he  simply  defended  his  stumps.  This 
innings  produced  218,  and  the  Free  Foresters  had  got  five 
of  the  A.  E.  E.  out  for  92  at  the  conclusion  of  the  second 
day's  play.  On  Saturday  George  Parr  had  to  acknowledge 
that  T.  O.  Reay  was  his  master,  as  the  second  ball  that 


A.  E.  E.  53 

bowler  gave  him  took  his  wicket,  as  the  first  ball  from  the 
same  quarter  had  done  in  the  first  innings.  When  the 
eleven  were  out,  at  12.45,  for  134,  matters  began  to  get 
interesting,  and  the  A.  E.  E.  looked  like  winning,  as  at 
luncheon-time  5  wickets  had  gone  for  31  runs;  nor  did  7 
for  60  look  much  better.  Hornby  and  Mordaunt,  Evans 
and  Reay,  however,  played  steadily,  and  byes,  the  ground 
not  being  quite  perfect,  helped  the  score.  It  was  just 
when  Evans  went  in  that  a  ball,  hit  to  leg,  was  fielded  by 
a  large  dog,  who  calmly  lay  down  with  the  ball  between 
his  paws,  and  growled  at  George  Parr,  who  was  in  pursuit 
of  it.  Parr  halted  and  expostulated,  but  the  dog  growled 
ominously,  and  the  owner  had  to  be  found  to  call  him 
off  before  the  hit  could  be  fielded.  When  Reay  was  out, 
6  runs  were  required  to  win,  and  Mott  went  in.  "  I  think 
we  shall  win  now,"  observed  Jackson,  "for  Mr  Goodrich  is 
tired  out,  and  Mr  Mott  'ad  'is  'it  first  innings."  However, 
Mott  sent  a  ball  from  Tarrant  about  two  feet  out  of  Capt. 
Marshall's  reach,  Evans  made  a  single,  Jackson  bowled  a 
wide,  a  tie,  and  Mott  triumphantly  finished  the  match 
with  a  stroke  for  2.

On  Monday,  Aug.  4 — Sunday  fortunately  being  a  day  of 
rest  after  the  excitement  of  the  great  win  of  Saturday — 
the  annual  match  with  twenty-two  of  Sutton  took  place. 
The  local  men  were  supplemented  by  several  good 
cricketers,  as  the  names  of  Chinn,  Mott,  Inge,  and 
Coyney  prove;  but  Goodrich  took  15  of  their  wickets, 
and  they  were  all  out  for  70;  against  which  F.  F.  made 
149 — F.  G.  Inge  50,  B.  B.  Cooper  27  (not  out),  W.  J. 
Lyon  23.  In  the  second  innings,  Goodrich  not  bowling, 
the  twenty-two  made   104. 

The  next  day,  by  invitation  of  Lord  Aylesford,  Free 
Foresters  met  I  Zingari  again  on  his  Lordship's  ground 
at  Packington.  "  Sore  and  hard  I  Z.  struggled  for  victory, 
but  fortune  went  for  their  opponents ;  in  their  three- 
coloured  robe  of  virtue  they  were  fain  to  enwrap  them- 
selves, to  look  pleasant,  and  to  pay  up,"  said  *  Bell's  Life.* 
"Mr  W.  G.  Armitstead's  performance  in  the  second 
innings  was  artistic,  and  displayed  an  accurate  knowledge 
of  the  regulation  height  as  at  present  insisted  on  at  the 
Horse  Guards  :  the  fielding  of  the  Forest  brethren  was 
superb  ;  and  to  their  excellence  in  that  department,  com- 
bined with  Goodrich's  mathematical  precision  of  delivery, 
must  the  large  margin  of  their  victory  be  ascribed."

The  "  regulation  height "  mentioned  above  refers  to  the 
fact  that  Capt.  Marshall  just  failed  to  reach  a  sharp  cut 
of  Armitstead's  which  got  up  surprisingly.  Mott,  who 
obtained  one  wicket  in  the  second  innings,  wanted  to  claim 
another, — a  hard  hit  of  Fellows  from  him  having  stuck 
between  two  of  the  park  pales,  whence  it  was  extracted  by- 
Price,  who  smartly  returned  it,  and  the  batsman  was  run 
out,  Mott  insisting  that  as  it  had  not  touched  the  ground  it 
was  a  catch  from  his  bowling. 

The  match  being  over  early  the  second  day,  a  scratch 
game  was  got  up,  in  which  Goodrich,  with  five  consecutive 
balls,  took  the  wickets  of  Drake,  Faber,  Mitchell,  Tred- 
croft,  and  Harbord. 

On  August  7  Foresters  got,  at  Sutton  Coldfield,  174 
against  a  local  team,  hight  "  Warwickshire  Knickerbockers," 
Faber  improving  his  average  by  making  61  (not  out). 
Although  there  were  among  the  Knickers  some  pretty 
good  players,  Goodrich  got  10  wickets  for  83  runs. 

At  Leamington  on  the  14th  they  met  Deddington, 
against  whom  they  scored  85 — T.  O.  Reay  29 — and  then 
got  them  out  for  48.  In  a  second  innings  F.  F.  made  136 
— F.  R.  Evans  41,  A.  E.  Seymour  27,  &amp;c.;  and  one  Ded- 
dington wicket  was  down  for  33,  T.  E.  Cobb  24  (not  out). 
Reay,  Brandt,  and  Evans  bowled  for  F.  F.

CHELFORD. 


Foresters  were  not,  however,  to  conclude  this  briUiant 
season  without  experiencing  some  of  the  rough  as  well  as 
the  smooth  gales  of  fortune.  At  Chelford,  in  a  return 
match  with  Surrey  Club,  they  sustained  a  virtual  defeat 
on  Aug.  21  and  22,  caused  by  bad  fielding  on  their  part, 
and  a  still  greater  mishap  in  an  accident  which  crippled 
Mr  Goodrich's  right  hand.

In  their  match  with  the  Western  Club  at  Manchester 
they  lost,  though  not  discreditably,  having  only  eight 
effectives.  The  Club  went  in  first,  and  got  202,  to  which 
F.  R,  by  the  aid  of  three  good  and  true  emergencies,  re- 
sponded with  207 — J.  Mordaunt  making  37,  H.  E.  Hulton 
32,  A.  E.  Seymour  34,  W.  Coyney  24,  &amp;c.  The  Western 
then  made  103,  and  got  F.  F.  out  for  86^  nobody  making  a 
stand  save  Mr  Turner,  a  substitute. 

And  although  they  saved  their  next  match  on  Sept.  9  and 
10  at  Nottingham  against  the  Diamonds,  the  latter,  as  the 
reporter  put  it,  "  sparkled  at  the  expense  of  the  Foresters 
pretty  considerably."  A  word  must  be  said  in  explanation 
of  the  position  of  this  Club.  It  was  the  outcome  of  the 
dissatisfaction  with  which  certain  fathers  of  cricket  in  the 
counties  of  Nottingham,  Leicester,  and  Derby  viewed  the 
assumption  by  residents  in  the  western  shires  of  the  lead 
in  Midland  cricket.  They  sneered  at  the  Foresters,  until 
the  matches  at  Lord's  and  Manchester  in  1 861  rendered 
that  course  of  action  no  longer  possible,  and  then  with 
some  pomp  announced  the  advent  of  a  central  county  club 


6o  WHATS  IN  A   NAME? 

to  be  called  the  Midland  Harlequins.  This  was  a  sad  mis- 
nomer, for  the  Oxford  Harlequins  had  no  intention  of 
allowing  their  well-known  title  to  be  wrested  from  them. 
A  humorous  letter  appeared  in  '  Bell's  Life,'  sarcastically- 
informing  the  sponsors  of  the  new  organisation  that  their 
proposed  name  was  pre-engaged,  and  suggesting  that  if 
they  must  resort  to  pantomime  for  their  nomenclature, 
there  were  other  male  characters  whose  designation  would 
suit  them.  The  force  of  the  remark  was  too  obvious,  and 
the  unattached  name  of  Diamonds  was  substituted.  But 
as  the  letter  was  transparently  the  production  of  a  well- 
known  cricketer  almost  as  much  identified  with  Free 
Foresters  as  with  Harlequins,  it  became  an  open  secret 
that  the  great  desire  of  the  new  club  was  to  meet  and  van- 
quish those  whom  they  chose  to  dub  their  rivals.  This 
indeed  they  did  ;  for  going  in  first,  W.  Bury  played  a  fault- 
less innings  of  121,  well  supported  by  H.  S.  Wright  and 
A.  W.  Daniel  who  got  44  each,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c. — total  315.  A 
downpour  of  rain,  which  descended  immediately  after 
stumps  were  drawn,  and  continued  all  night,  made  the 
batsman's  task  next  day  a  difficult  one.  Foresters  had  to 
follow  on,  and  finally  drew  the  match,  being  still  45  runs 
behind  with  4  wickets  down — H.  S.  Armitstead  46  and  54, 
A.  H.  Faber  38  and  41,  and  T.  O.  Reay  24,  being  the  chief 
contributors.  A  square-leg  hit  of  Armitstead's  off  Daniel 
was  the  sensation  of  the  day.  Mitchell,  for  the  Diamonds, 
took  7  wickets.  Although  this  match  was  a  disappoint- 
ment at  the  moment,  the  upshot  was  most  satisfactory. 
The  after- doings  of  the  Diamonds  I  am  not  able  to 
report ;  but  Mitchell,  Daniel,  and  others  who  then  wore  their 
colours,  became  shortly  constant  and  vigorous  supporters 
of  Free  Foresters. 

The  last  match  of  this  eventful  season  was  also  drawn, 
but  much  in  favour  of  Foresters,  who  had  only  7  runs  to 
get  and  6  wickets  to  fall.     It  was  at  Rugby,  against  the

School,  Case  41  and  27,  Robertson  23  and  38,  Hood  20 
and  21  ;  for  Foresters,  O.  Mordaunt  50  and  6,  A.  E.  Sey- 
mour 17  and  26  (not  out),  M.  T.  Martin  35  and  7,  T.  O.

At  the  end  of  this  season  we  had  a  lyric  from  our 
Laureate,  full  of  felicitous  comment  upon  the  doings  of 
the  brotherhood,  first  sung  with  great  applause  by  the 
writer  at  our  friend  Mr  Hole's  hospitable  mansion  in 
Nottinghamshire : —

"  Foresters  and  friends,  it's  a  fact  I  wish  to  mention, 
One  department  of  your  studies  hasn't  had  enough  attention : 
In  the  letters  of  the  Alphabet,  if  I  rightly  understand, 
There  are  symptoms  and  signs  of  our  Midland  counties  band.

The  Forest  banner  braves  the  cricket-battle  and  the  breeze. 
Then  judge^  &amp;^c. 

D  is  for  the  Diamonds,  whom  we're  never  slow  to  meet ; 
E  the  Ease  with  which  we  sometimes  lay  our  rivals  at  our  feet ;

G  the  Gay  Good-humour  of  whoever  gets  the  runs.

H  is  for  the  Hosts  who  put  us  all  so  kindly  up. 
And  mix  a  drink  without  one  leaf  of  burrage  in  the  cup ; 
Also  for  the  fair  Hostesses,  each  of  whom  deserves  a  poem, 
To  show  something  of  the  gratitude  we're  well  aware  we  owe  'em.

With  which,  I  trust,  we'll  all  salute  our  next  convivial  meeting.

RESIGNATION.  63 

With  this  season  also  my  own  connection  with  the  Club 
as  its  first  Secretary  closed.  There  were  domestic  and 
personal  reasons  for  this  ;  but,  moreover,  the  Club  had 
outgrown  the  sort  of  brotherhood  only  compatible  with 
the  consciousness  of  individual  friendship  and  a  community 
of  tastes  and  feelings  on  other  subjects  than  cricket,  and 
though,  in  spite  of  their  ever-widening  circle,  Foresters  had 
in  a  great  measure  answered  to  the  spirit  of  their  motto, 
"  United  though  Untied,"  yet  it  was  evident  that  hence- 
forward they  must  be  more  under  the  control  of  a  com- 
mittee than  "personally  conducted,"  and  assimilate  them- 
selves to  the  modes  of  other  combinations  of  cricketers, 
instead  of  being,  what  Scholes  Birch  called  them,  the 
*'  happy  family."  In  their  earlier  contests  there  had  been 
little  of  the  mechanical  precision  of  modern  matches,  as, 
for  instance,  when  the  Secretary  would  walk  round  the 
ground  during  a  game,  and  suggest,  through  one  of  the 
outfielders,  a  change  of  bowling, — an  irregular  interference 
which  would  be  very  naturally  resented  by  a  captain  of 
the  present  day,  but  which  the  half-dozen  managers  who 
lived  in  such  intimate  association  were  by  no  means  sur- 
prised at,  and  often  good-naturedly  complied  with.  "  One 
thing  has  often  struck  me,"  writes  Birch  ;  "  I  have  no  recol- 
lection of  a  captain  to  the  team,  yet  some  one  must  have 
written  out  the  '  order  of  going  in  '  and  settled  who  should 
bowl." 

Our  engagements  likewise  were  becoming  too  numerous. 
This,  in  fact,  brought  me  for  some  years  into  harness 
again  occasionally,  as  I  could  not  but  try  to  assist  my 
successors  to  carry  out  plans  which  I  had  formed ;  but  I 
would  not  take  the  prominent  place  I  had  held  up  to  this 
date,  and  the  "  Rector's  resignation  "  was  the  accomplished 
fact  of  1863.  "The  brethren  of  the  Free  Forest,  the  most 
kindly,  united,  and  undaunted  of  nomad  tribes,"  presented 
me  with  a  very  tasteful  and  elegant  token  of  their  regard, — 


64  PRESENTATION, 

a  life-long  source  of  pleasure  and  of  pride  to  one  who  did 
her  best  to  make  my  roof  a  home  for  cricketers  ;  and  I 
still  had  the  gratification  of  seeing  the  success  of  my 
design,  though  the  personal  pronoun  will  not  be  so  often 
used  in  connection  with  it.

CHAPTER    VIII. 
i86 


'3- 


It  will  be  remembered  that  certain  engagements  of  a 
high  class  in  cricket  had  been  made  by  the  late  secretary. 
Two  of  these  were  to  come  off  in  the  season  of  1863 — 
namely,  contests  with  the  two  champion  counties  of 
Surrey  and  Nottingham,  Foresters  playing  fourteen  in 
each  match.  In  these,  of  course,  the  promoter  felt  a 
personal  interest ;  and  he  gave  what  assistance  he  could 
to  his  successor,  Mr  Faber,  in  getting  the  teams  together, 
and  completing  the  other  arrangements.  Meanwhile  the 
annual  routine  of  matches  was  steadily  gone  through. 

F.  F.  beat  the  Rugby  School  eleven  by  4  wickets  on  May 
18  and  19  in  stormy  weather.  The  School  went  in  first 
and  scored  151,  getting  F.  F.  out  for  106.  The  second 
innings  realised  201  (extras  nil) — T.  Case  making  40  and 
45,  R.  Murray  10  and  53  (not  out),  H.  V.  Ellis  14  and  34, 
R.  Cotton  29  and  24,  A.  Lee  33  and  o.  But  F.  R,  with 
S.  Linton  28  and  70,  C.  G.  Lane  19  and  53,  and  some 
minor  scores,  ran  up  247  for  6  wickets.  Buchanan  took 
8  wickets. 

At  Oxford,  on  June  i,  Bullingdon  made  a  drawn  match 
of  it,  scoring  80  runs  with  a  wicket  to  fall  against  F.  F.  140 
— E.  Waller  46,  B.  Fetherston  26,  J.  E.  Codrington  20  (not 
out) ;  and  on  the  2d  and  3d  F.  F.  beat  B.  N.  C.  in  one 
innings  of  140 — B.  B.  Cooper  scoring  109  (not  out),  while 

E 


66  WEYBRIDGE  SCHOOL. 

the  College  could  only  claim  39  and  94.  The  next  day's 
match  with  Ch.  Ch.  they  won  as  easily,  the  House  only 
scoring  59  to  Buchanan  and  Gillett's  bowling,  while  F.  F. 
made  187  for  6  wickets — Cooper  52,  F.  W.  Wright  49, 
Gillett  44,  and  Caldecott  17  (not  out). 

At  Weybridge,  on  June  20,  they  beat  Dr  Spyers's  School, 
despite  Goodrich's  bowling,  in  one  innings.  It  may  be 
noted,  especially  with  reference  to  some  remarks  a  little 
later  on  upon  this  point,  that  the  "  ould  man "  never 
showed  to  less  advantage  than  on  the  school  ground,  which 
was  a  very  confined  one,  so  that  a  lofty  hitter  was  able  to 
lift  him  over  the  hedge  with  impunity.  This  F.  R.  Evans 
did  in  this  very  match,  and  scored  44  out  of  128  made  by 
F.  F.,  Weybridge  only  scoring  71  and  53. 

Civil  Service  also  succumbed  in  one  innings  on  July  6, 
Buchanan  and  Osbert  Mordaunt  taking  their  wickets  for 
105  and  49  (two  absentees),  F.  F.  having  made  200,  of 
which  E.  Hume  claims  51,  J.  W.  Inge  48  (not  out),  A.  H. 
Faber  24,  H.  Finch  17,  &amp;c. 

But  at  Southgate,  though,  as  the  reporter  said,  strong 
on  paper,  they  met  with  a  sad  reverse  on  July  7  and  8. 
Hearne  and  Humphrey  played  for  Southgate.

On  the  three  next  days  their  important  engagement  at 
the  Oval  terminated  in  a  sensational  and  unexpected  suc- 
cess. Two  of  the  fourteen  did  not  put  in  an  appearance, 
but  a  serviceable  emergency  was  secured  in  Mr  Beaver, 
there  being  a  chance  that  Goodrich  might  play  on  the 
next  day.  Imagine  the  faces  of  the  backers  of  Surrey 
when,  after  the  Forester  innings  (12  wickets)  had  closed  for 
116,  they  saw  four  of  their  crack  batsmen  out  to  Buchanan 
and  Ratliff  for  8  runs  —  seven  for  16,  and  the  whole  10 
wickets  for  34. 

I  did  not  see  the  match,  but  meeting  Griffith  a  few  days 
after,  I  asked  him  how  such  a  startling  result  came  about. 
"  Well,  sir,"  said  he,  "  'twas  this  way.  Mr  Ratliff  he  ran 
right  up  to  Mortlock's  crease  and  caught  him,  and  the 
rest  of  us  went  in  in  a  funk."  Ratliff  bowled  lobs,  and 
certainly  fielded  them  splendidly.  Buchanan  says,  "  The 
ground  was  hard  and  true,  and  with  fast  bowling  my 
analysis  was  as  follows  "  : — 

First  innings 
Second    ,, 

Ratliff 's  bowling  in  both  innings  was  239  balls,  131  runs, 
16  maidens,  9  wickets.

On  July  24  and  25,  at  Sutton  Coldfield,  the  Incogniti 
were  saved  from  defeat  by  rain  on  the  second  day — 
Foresters  making  141  and  176,  Incogs,  y^  and  30,  with  4 
wickets  down.  Our  champions  were  R.  T.  Whittington  65, 
C.  J.  Marshall  51,  W.  K.  Mott  13  and  43. 

And  at  Leamington,  on  the  30th,  Deddington  had 
slightly  the  worse  of  a  fine  day's  play,  scoring  137  against 
Foresters'  192,  of  which  W.  K.  Mott  scored  56,  F.  Caldecott 
and  W.  Ratliff  31  each,  C.  A.  Garnett  29;  Mott  and  Vernon 
were  the  F.  F.  bowlers.

ARMITSTEAUS  NARRATIVE.  69 

At  the  Western  Manchester,  on  Aug.  5  and  6,  the  home 
team  went  in  first,  and  stayed  all  day  against  Mott  and 
Goodrich  and  others  for  279.  The  following  morning 
Mott  and  a  Harrow  boy,  Cecil  Hornby,  went  to  the  wicket, 
and  though  the  former  only  got  the  one  run  which  Jack- 
son considered  his  due,  Hornby  and  Tomkinson  stayed 
in,  one  for  26,  the  other  for  108  ;  and  at  luncheon-time, 
when  rain  stopped  the  match,  E.  K.  Hornby  was  34  and 
R.  T.  Whittington   10,  both  not  out.     Three  wickets  for 

194- 
The  next  match  was  the  fixture  at  Nottingham. 

The  best  and  most  closely  contested  match,  "from  find  to 
finish,"  as  fox-hunters  say,  that  I  ever  had  the  happiness  to  take 
part  in,  "  Cujus  pars  parva  fui "  ! 

It  was  held  by  the  bigwigs  of  Notts  to  be  a  flight  of  no  small 
ambition,  not  to  say  presumption,  for  fourteen  members  of  a 
club  of  amateurs,  of  moderate  if  rising  repute,  to  face  the  Premier 
County  of  England,  at  the  time  in  the  very  zenith  of  its  fame. 

Perhaps  it  was  so;  yet,  at  least,  the  result  justified  the 
attempt. 

Thirty  long  years  have  passed  since  then ;  but  never  have  I 
witnessed,  still  less  borne  a  hand  in,  a  contest  of  more  sustained 
interest,  or  in  which  has  been  exhibited  more  attractive  Cricket : 
every  stroke,  I  had  almost  said  every  ball,  in  that  long  three 
days'  battle,  is  still  fresh  and  vividly  painted  on  my  memory ;  and 
I  am  pleased  and  proud  to  have  been  invited  to  furnish  my  recol- 
lections of  the  match. 

The  weather  throughout  was  splendid,  and  the  wicket  good 
and  very  fast,  and  the  interest  shown  by  the  grand  old  town  and 
county  of  Notts  keen  and  generous. 

One  of  those  selected  to  play  for  the  honour  of  F.  F.,  M.  T. 
Martin,  was  unwell,  and  his  place  was  taken  by  a  small  Harrow 
boy,  C.  L.  Hornby,  who  justified  the  choice  by  pluck  with  the  bat 
and  activity  in  the  field.  George  Parr — that  veteran  of  a  thousand 
fights — when  shall  we  look  on  his  like  again  ? — was  also  prevented 
from  playing  by  illness,  and  in  his  room  Martin  M'Intyre,  an 
erratic  but  exceedingly  fast  and  rather  dangerous  bowler,  was 
brought  out,  and  in  the  first  innings  bowled  with  great  effect,  as 
the  score  shows.  I  myself  remember  receiving  from  him  a  short- 
pitched  ball  on  the  off,  which  jumped  high,  and  ought  to  have 
been  left  severely  alone,  but   I   could  not  resist  the  tempting

length,  and  cut  it  so  hard  that  C.  Tinley,  at  deep  long-sHp,  one 
of  the  best  fields  of  his  time,  could  not  hold  it,  and  it  went  off 
his  hands  and  over  his  head  for  two  or  three  runs. 

F.  F.  in  the  first  innings  scored  only  114.  "Where  are  your 
great  Free  Foresters  now  ?  "  asked  Capt.  H.,  an  enthusiastic  and 
keen-witted  Notts  partisan.  Indeed  things  did  look  a  bit  black 
for  our  Club,  but  what  was  the  surprise  of  the  wise  ones  who 
were  assembled,  like  the  grasshoppers  of  Homer,^  chirping,  chatter- 
ing, and  criticising  the  long  day  through  on  the  benches  and  green 
sward,  to  find  that,  with  the  two  exceptions  of  R.  Daft  and  Bramp- 
ton, the  men  of  Notts  could  not  play  Goodrich  "  a  little  bit." 

Let  me  here  tell  modern  cricketers  something  of  the  character 
and  method  of  that  most  excellent  bowler. 

He  was  an  underhand  bowler,  slow,  but  no  mere  pitcher  of 
lobs.  He  owed  his  success,  which  was  almost  unfailing  on  all 
sorts  of  wickets,  to  his  long  head,  his  marvellous  precision,  and 
his  invincible  courage  and  temper.  Of  course  he  needed  a  good 
field,  and  that  F.  F.  always  supplied.  When  he  had  against 
him  a  foeman  worthy  of  his  arm,  he  was  indeed  a  sight  for  gods 
and  men  :  he  had  a  slight  but  not  a  startling  twist  from  the  leg, 
given  by  the  wrist  and  not  the  fingers.  On  great  occasions,  when 
he  had  to  deal  with  a  really  dangerous  bat,  like  C.  G.  Lane  or 
R.  A.  Mitchell,  he  would  always  bowl  from  the  off-side  of  the 
wicket,  and  pitch  every  ball  on  the  middle  or  two  leg  stumps, 
varying  only  a  little  in  length,  pace,  or  height  in  the  air.  No 
one,  be  he  ever  so  quick  on  his  feet,  could  get  to  his  ball  and 
thrash  it  where  he  liked  on  the  full  pitch  :  if  a  batsman  meant 
to  hit  him  he  must  go  right  out  to  meet  him  on  the  half- 
volley,  and  take  his  risk  of  stumping  and  accidents ;  but  woe  to 
him  if  he  persisted  in  playing  back  ;  inch  by  inch  would  the  ball 
be  pitched  further  up^  till  the  batsman,  getting  no  sight  at  all, 
would  be  either  driven  on  his  wicket,  or  bowled  neck  and  heels 
by  one  a  shade  faster  and  farther  up,  and  would  retire  to  his 
friends  in  the  pavilion,  gnashing  his  teeth,  and  open  to  the 
severest  remarks  of  every  one  with  a  stick  or  umbrella  in  his 
hands  instead  of  a  bat, — and  how  well  and  bravely  one  does 
play — in  the  pavilion  / 

Another  thing  I  must  mention  :  Goodrich  bowled  so  triie^  in 
length  and  straightness,  that  point  could  safely  stand  within  five 
yards  of  the  bat,  just  behind  the  batting-crease,  and  the  hardest 
hitter  in  the  world  could  not  hurt  him,  no,  nor  ruffle  a  feather  of 
his  wing.  It  will  be  easily  seen  how  pleasant  this  was  to  a 
batsman.     I  have  seen  them — Jemmy  Grundy,  for  instance,  who

had  an  undaunted  heart,  but  rather  a  warm  temper,  hft  up  his 
bat  and  threaten  point  therewith,  as  if  he  would  thoroughly 
enjoy  knocking  off  his  head  on  the  spot ;  and  then  to  see  them 
play  out  at  the  next  ball  perhaps,  a  bit  shorter  than  they  thought 
it,  and  gently  poke  it  into  the  ready  hands  of  point,  who  had 
crept  even  nearer  to  wait  for  it !     Oh,  it  was  a  thing  to  see ! 

All  this,  and  much  more,  was  over  and  over  again  exemplified 
in  this  very  match.  And  this,  I  hope,  will  be  held  to  be  some 
excuse  for  my  long  digression. 

R.  Daft,  I  may  say,  played  Goodrich  very  well  indeed,  and 
with  boundless  patience^  but  could  scarcely  get  a  run  off  him,  and 
the  others  were  mostly — noivhere  I 

Well,  there  being  only  one  run  between  the  two  rather  small 
scores  of  the  first  innings,  no  bones  were  as  yet  broken,  and  in- 
terest was  still  alive  for  the  second.  But  how  different  in  char- 
acter was  the  batting  in  the  second  venture ! 

The  two  first  men  at  once  collared  ^^Smacktntyrej'^  as  his  friends 
called  him,  in  graceful  allusion  to  the  violence  of  his  attack,  and 
he  was,  besides,  so  bad  to  stop  behind  the  wicket,  that  he  had 
to  be  taken  off  as  being  too  expensive.  One  cannot  help  wonder- 
ing what  present-day  wicket-keepers  would  do  with  such  a  bowler 
without  a  long-stop.  I  may  say,  without  tedious  particulars,  that 
Bull  and  Mitchell  much  surprised  the  Notts  spectators  by  the 
fineness  and  dash  of  their  play ;  and  when  F.  W.  Wright  came  in 
he  electrified  them  with  his  hitting :  he  hit  all  the  bowlers  alike, 
clean  and  hard,  along  the  ground;  and  when  Tinley,  the  slow 
bowler,  was  put  on,  it  was  only  to  experience  still  more  drastic 
treatment.  Wright  was  so  quick  on  his  legs,  and  so  determined, 
that  he  got  to  every  ball,  and  made  it  visit  each  corner  of  the 
ground  in  turn.  Finally,  he  hit  Jackson — a  rare  feat  with  so  fast 
and  fine  a  bowler — over  his  head,  far  out  of  the  ground,  and  over 
the  road  beyond  into  a  garden.  The  ball  was  in  truth  a  lost  one, 
for  it  never  was  found.  A  new  one  was  produced  from  the 
paviHon,  and,  strange  to  say,  Jackson  bowled  him  with  a  shooting 
Yorker  the  very  next  ball.  When  I  mention  that  out  of  a  total 
of  64,  obtained  in  about  half-an-hour,  Wright  hit  ten  fours,  a 
five,  and  a  six  against  the  then  best  bowlers  in  England,  I  need 
not  say  that  the  spectators  had  a  treat  foreshadowing  Mr  Stoddart 
or  Mr  O'Brien  at  their  best. 

In  fine,  F.  F.  put  together  2 1 2  in  the  second  innings — a  score, 
in  those  days,  more  than  respectable. 

Notts  went  in  the  third  morning  and  played,  most  of  them, 
with  great  determination  ;  but  again  none  of  them  but  R.  Daft 
could  do  much  with  Goodrich,  backed  up  by  fourteen  fieldsmen 
of  more  than  average  quickness.     Daft  played  a  fine  game,  but 


72  ARMITSTEAD'S  NARRATIVE. 

I  feel  sure  his  memory  would  bear  me  out  in  saying  that  he 
could  get  no  runs  from  Goodrich, — he  could  but  stay  there,  with 
all  his  skill  and  impregnable  defence.  When  9  wickets  of  Notts 
were  down,  they  still  needed  67,  runs  to  reach  the  F.  F.  total, 
and  the  case  of  the  county  seemed  hopeless — but  with  the 
occasion  (as  sometimes  happens)  came  the  men,  for  here  came 
in  the  great  surprise  of  the  match  :  Wootton  and  Biddulph 
became  partners,  one  of  whom  was  played  entirely  for  his 
bowling,  and  the  other  as  a  wicket-keeper,  neither  having  a 
very  high  reputation  as  a  batsman ;  yet,  somehow,  they  seemed 
to  stick,  and  each  began,  now  and  then,  to  get  runs,  chiefly 
at  the  fast  bowler's  end.  Buchanan  was  then  a  fast  and 
difficult  left-handed  bowler,  and  a  bit  dangerous  to  legs  and 
fingers,  not  the  slow  dodger,  with  an  off-break,  like  that  of 
Briggs  and  Peel  now,  which  he  afterwards  developed  into :  in 
fact,  his  only  variation  to  his  usual  fast  and  kicking  ball  was 
a  slow  half-volley  chucked  up,  as  if  for  the  very  purpose  of 
being  hit  for  four.  These  balls,  I  am  bound  to  say,  Biddulph 
made  free  use  of  till,  in  fine,  instead  of  being  ^2)  ^u'^s  ^"^  arrear, 
the  scorers  had  actually  stood  up  for  the  tie,  while  the  winning 
run  should  be  made.  Here,  at  last,  from  over  eagerness,  or 
a  nervous  wish  to  get  home,  the  steadiness  of  Biddulph  gave 
way,  and  he  ran  in  to  one  of  Goodrich  straight  on  the  middle 
stump,  played  in  with  his  leg  instead  of  his  bat — and  paid 
forfeit. 

Hurrah  !  a  tie  after  all !  Surprise  upon  surprise  !  So,  while 
Notts  headed  the  score  by  one  run  in  the  first  innings,  F.  F.  did 
the  very  same  thing  in  the  second,  making  a  sort  of  double  tie, — 
thus  altering  for  the  nonce  the  well-known  though  enigmatic  motto 
of  F.  F. — "  United  but  not  Untied."  The  scene,  as  reporters  say, 
"  beggared  description." 

The  Trent  Bridge  ground  was  then  a  far  more  free-and-easy 
sort  of  place  than,  I  feel  sure,  it  is  in  these  more  highly  organ- 
ised days  :  the  old  paviHon  combined  a  bar  with  its  dressing- 
rooms,  &amp;c.,  and  both  sexes  were  admitted  in  it;  and  dressing 
seemed  to  go  on  in  public,  varied  and  enlivened  by  liquid 
refreshment. 

My  last  recollection  of  the  match  is  of  several  smart  young 
ladies  patting  or  sttiacking  the  plump  shoulders  of  Buchanan, 
while  they,  in  this  hearty  fashion,  congratulated  him  on  his 
personal  prowess. 

Now,  ye  Moderns  !  if  you  can  promise  to  show  me  a  better 
and  more  exciting  match  than  that  which  I  have  tried  to  describe, 
I,  on  my  part,  will  go  a  good  way  to  look  at  it. — Yours  sincerely, 

W.  G.  A.

I  must  supplement  this  admirable  and  spirited  narra- 
tive by  one  or  two  other  recollections.  One  of  the  keenest 
of  the  critics  not  only  volunteered  a  very  disparaging 
comment  upon  Bull's  play,  but  wound  up  by  offering  a 
bet  that  he  did  not  make  17  runs  again  in  the  second 
innings.  Armitstead  promptly  took  him  up,  and  handed 
him  17s.,  to  receive  in  return  is.  a-run,  to  the  noble 
captain's  great  contentment.  By -and -by,  however,  his 
face  began  to  lengthen,  and  he  was  barely  perceptible 
far  away  in  the  distance,  evidently  dreading  chaff.  Noth- 
ing would  satisfy  Mitchell  but  to  go  and  talk  to  him, 
but  as  Mitchell  approached  he  edged  away,  and  finally, 
having  made  the  circuit  of  the  ground,  was  run  to  earth 
just  in  his  old  position,  in  time  to  look  pleasant  and  pay 
up  a  couple  of  sovereigns  and  a  shilling  to  boot. 

But  his.  discomfiture  was  nothing  to  that  of  a  deaf 
gentleman  residing  in  Nottingham,  no  cricketer,  but  a 
great  sportsman,  and  one  who  liked  to  have  a  little 
money  on  an  event.  He  began  by  backing  the  County 
at  odds,  but  when  Foresters'  second  innings  was  in  pro- 
gress he  became  alarmed  and  backed  them,  at  odds  also. 
When  the  tie  was  declared,  his  face,  which  had  been  a 
study  for  the  last  half-hour,  cleared,  and  he  cried,  "  Thank 
goodness,  my  bets  are  off! "     When  he  found  that  the  rule

/  Z.  75 

in  such  a  case  was  to  put  the  money  together  and  divide 
it,  his  disgust  was  pitiable,  and  he  probably  to  this  day 
considers  cricket  a  swindle. 

Mr  Reay  recalls  the  scene  on  the  third  day.  It  was 
market-day  in  Nottingham,  and  when  word  went  up  to 
the  farmers'  ordinaries  that  the  County  were  going  to 
win  after  all,  the  taverns  were  deserted,  and  the  gate 
during  the  last  hour  was  the  best  in  the  match.  The 
Nottingham  lambs  looked  more  than  playful  when  the 
telegraph  showed  a  tie,  but  when  their  own  umpire  had 
to  give  Biddulph  out  1  b  w,  they  cheered  both  sides. 

As  the  earlier  match  at  Manchester  had  come  to  such 
an  untimely  end,  the  Western  Club  invited  Foresters  to 
pay  them  a  second  visit  on  Sept.  lo  and  ii,  when 
the  latter  won  by  9  wickets — Mitchell  98  and  Ratliff  53, 
helping  a  score  of  200,  and  getting  out  the  Westerners 
for  50  and  140 — Mitchell  accounting  for  7  wickets,  Ratliff 
for  6,  Lyon  for  5. 

On  the  17th  and  i8th  of  the  same  month  F.  F.  met  I  Z. 
again  at  Packington.

The  laurels  of  the  game  thus  went  to  Hornby,  of  whom 
an  opponent,  qualified  to  judge,  wrote,  "  Were  he  as  strong 
on  the  off-side  as  to  leg,  he  would  be  fit  to  play  in  the  first 
rank." 

At  Rugby,  on  Sept.  21  and  22,  Foresters  got  189,  and 
then  the  boys  just  saved  the  follow  on  by  making  no, 
Case  26 ;  and  in  the  second  innings  of  Foresters  only 
3  wickets  were  down  for  131.  Linton  scored  31  and  70, 
Bull  yj,  Caldecott  6  and  42  (not  out  twice),  Mordaunt 
22  and   13,  &amp;c. 

A  new  match  with  Uppingham  School  the  two  next 
days  finished  this  successful  season,  the  boys  only  getting 
55  and  53  to  Buchanan  and  Ratlifif's  bowling,  and  F.  F. 
scoring  144 — Colley  38,  Martin  22,  Caldecott  16,  &amp;c.

CHAPTER    IX. 
1864. 

This  year  Mr  Faber  had  arranged  to  hand  over  the 
secretaryship  to  Mr  Mitchell,  when  the  latter  found  him- 
self compelled  to  resign  most  of  his  cricket  engagements, 
owing  to  circumstances  over  which  he  had  no  control  ; 
consequently  the  programme  was  very  imperfectly  com- 
pleted, although  new  ground  was  taken  up  by  the  com- 
mencement of  the  tours  in  Scotland,  which  for  some  years 
were  so  prominent  a  feature  of  our  season. 

Foresters,  however,  played  strong  in  Oxford,  where  they 
commenced  on  May  10  (the  9th  being  wet)  against  Ch.  Ch., 
by  making  212 — Mitchell  53,  Linton  35,  Gillet  26,  CoUey 
and  Bull  each  23,  &amp;c.,  Ch.  Ch.  losing  9  wickets,  6  to  Buch- 
anan and  3  run  out,  for  102.  Bullingdon,  on  the  nth,  had 
to  field  all  day  to  ten  F.  F.  Stanhope  not  going  in,  E. 
K.  Hornby  made  123,  Mitchell  82  (not  out),  F.  W.  Wright 
and  R.  H.  Colley  29  each,  W.  G.  Armitstead  25. 

F.  F.  beat  B.  N.  C.  on  the  12th  and  13th  by  7  wickets, 
the  College  scoring  127  and  100.  F.  F.  got  in  and  119, 
of  which  E.  K.  Hornby  claimed  17  and  38,  C.  L.  Hornby 
12  and  23,  Linton  8  and  22,  Fetherston  2  and  22  (not  out). 
Buchanan  took  14  wickets. 

On  the  i6th  and  17th  they  made  another  successful 
departure  by  encountering  Cambridge  University.

The  Rugby  match  was  won  on  May  23  and  24,  with  10 
wickets  to  fall.  Bull  distinguished  himself  by  a  hit  for 
7  over  the  bowler's  head.  He  scored  13  and  49  (not 
out),  Robertson  5  and  20  (not  out),  Colley  73,  Buchanan 
38.  Totals  209  and  79.  For  the  School,  who  made  95  and 
192,  Ellis  4  and  57,  Bowey  25  (not  out)  and  20,  Kenney  7 
and  28,  did  best.     Buchanan  took  10  wickets. 

Weybridge  School  on  June  18  only  got  96,  to  154  and 
73  for  6  wickets  of  F.  F. — Stanhope  50  (not  out),  Cecil 
Reid  23  and  28  (not  out),  Finch  20  and  21,  O.  Mordaunt 
31,  being  chief  scorers.     Mr  Reid  writes  : — 

As  a  member  of  the  F.  F.  since  the  early  or  middle  "  sixties," 
and  having  always  been  very  partial  to  cricket,  though  but  an 
indiiferent  performer  at  the  noble  game,  I  naturally  came  into 


SFVEJ^S'S.  79 

contact  with  many  cricketers,  and  visited  many  pleasant  places, 
during  my  somewhat  lengthened  F.  F.  career,  which  I  always  shall 
look  back  upon  with  great  pleasure  now  that  the  "  ground  is  too 
far  off,"  and  that  the  "  chest  has  sunk."^  My  first  match — I  think 
in  1864 — for  the  Club  was  v.  Spyers's  School  at  Weybridge,  and 
one  or  two  of  the  masters  were  playing.  In  the  days  I  am  speak- 
ing of,  the  masters,  as  a  rule,  were  not  so  taken  from  the  ranks 
of  really  good  cricketers  as  they  are  now  at  Elstree  school  and 
other  schools,  and  I  always  thought  that  I  had  got  a  "  soft  thing 
on  "  when  they  went  on  to  bowl :  a  friend  of  mine,  now  the  Rev. 
C.  Spencer  Stanhope,  of  Merton,  was  playing,  and  we  were  in 
together,  and  we  smacked  a  master  all  over  the  ground.  He  was 
bowling  underhand  lobs.  We  each  got  a  good  score ;  and  it  was 
not  for  some  hours  afterwards  that  I  learnt  that  I  had  actually 
been  "tonking"  no  less  a  personage  than  T.  C.  Goodrich — 
probably  the  best  underhand  bowler  of  this  or  any  other  day. 
Just  fancy  my  impertinence  /  Why,  if  I  had  known  beforehand 
who  it  was,  I  should  of  course  have  been  bowled  out  first  ball! 
Shakespeare's  remark  of  "What's  in  a  name?"  was  the  worst 
thing  the  immortal  William  ever  wrote. 

Another  school  eleven  succumbed  at  Haileybury  on  the 
i8th,  who  got  140  to  172  from  F.  F.  M.  T.  Martin  scored 
39  and  20,  C.  H.  Bill  31  and  10,  A.  Lee  30  and  3  (not  out), 
S.  Linton  31  and  I.  F.  G.  Inge  arrived  too  late  for  his 
first  innings,  but  took  4  wickets  and  got  41  runs.  Mr  Bill 
was  credited  in  the  report  of  the  match  with  85  ;  and  this 
error  remaining  undetected,  figured  as  one  of  the  scores  of 
the  season  in  those  days,  when  centuries  were  less  com- 
mon than  they  are  now. 

Nothing  was  done  by  the  Club  till  the  autumn,  when 
the  old  secretary  essayed  to  get  together  a  team  for  a 
northern  tour  beginning  on  Aug.  23  and  24  at  Chelford, 
where  the  Armitsteads  and  Hornbys  played  for  their 
county  against  their  Club.  Out  of  335  runs  made  in  the 
two  innings  of  Cheshire,  H.  S.  Armitstead  made  64, 
W.  G.  A.  48,  E.  K.  Hornby  40,  C.  L.  H.  21.  F.  W. 
Wright  7  and  53,  F.  G.  Inge  28  and  25  (not  out),  and  S. 
Lyttelton  31  and  10,  did  best  for  Foresters,  whose  totals 
were  121  and  120. 


So  A   SERIOUS  ACCIDENT, 

At  the  Western  ground,  Eccles,  on  the  two  next  days  they 
left  a  most  interesting  game  unfinished.  The  Western 
Club,  for  whom  F.  W.  Wright  was  now  playing,  with  the 
assistance  of  89  runs  from  him  and  47  from  Bousfield,  made 
234.  Free  Foresters  started  well,  and  F.  G.  Inge  seemed 
on  the  point  of  obtaining  his  century,  when  a  ball  got  up 
sharply  and  struck  him  on  the  breast-bone.  He  rubbed 
the  place  with  his  hand  for  a  second  or  two,  and  was  just 
taking  guard  to  receive  the  next  ball,  when  he  suddenly 
fell  on  his  face,  to  all  appearance  lifeless.  Fortunately 
the  late  Dr  Morgan  (whose  book  on  University  oarsmen 
is  so  well  known)  was  playing  on  the  side  of  the  Western, 
and  by  his  efficient  aid  consciousness  was  soon  restored, 
and  no  subsequent  evil  effect  experienced. 

With  Inge's  98,  Foresters  achieved  a  total  of  232, 
W.  W.  C.  Lane  45,  W.  G.  Armitstead  23,  &amp;c.,  and  having 
got  out  the  Club  for  201,  of  which  M'Donald  made  95,  had 
scored  at  the  end  of  the  day  71  for  2  wickets,  W.  G. 
Armitstead  25,  and  H.  E.  Bull  31. 

The  Free  Foresters  naturally  wished  to  show  in  some 
suitable  way  their  feeling  of  gratitude  for  the  services  ren- 
dered to  one  of  their  eleven  by  Dr  Morgan.  The  artistic 
taste  of  a  member  (Halifax  Wyatt)  settled  that  the  pre- 
sentation should  take  the  shape  of  a  plain  gold  ring,  bear- 
ing our  motto,  "  United  though  Untied,"  and  within,  the 
legend  in  old  English  characters — 

"^a  frmti  gn  neUe  p  a  frmli  2«  ftrte." 
Thus  handsomely  acknowledged  by  the  recipient : — 

Eccles,  Oct.  3, 

My  dear  Sir, — I  trust  you  will  convey  to  the  Free  Foresters 
who  played  against  the  Western  Club,  my  deep  sense  of  their 
great  kindness  in  sending  me  so  generous  and  beautiful  a  token 
of  their  regard  for  the  slight  assistance  which  it  was  my  happy 
privilege  to  render  to  one  of  their  members. 

I  would  desire  likewise  to  thank  them  for  the  honour  they 


THE  RING.  8i 

have  done  me,  in  electing  me  a  member  of  their  Club,  and  to 
assure  them  of  the  gratification  and  pride  I  shall,  feel  in  wearing 
their  colours. 

To  yourself,  as  their  representative,  for  the  kind  manner  in 
which  you  have  given  expression  to  their  wishes,  I  shall  ever  feel 
that  my  gratitude  is  due. — Believe  me,  my  dear  Sir,  yours  very 
truly,  John  Ed.  Morgan. 

The  tour  in  Scotland  will  be  found  in  its  place  in  the 
chapter  dealing  with  this  portion  of  our  history.  We  drew 
three  matches  in  terrible  weather. 

On  the  same  days  as  our  last  match  in  Scotland,  Sept. 
14  and  15,  another  F.  F.  team  made  210  against  Upping- 
ham— M.  T.  Martin  114  (not  out),  Boyle  47,  &amp;c.,  while  the 
Boys  made  132  and  35.     Buchanan  took  11  wickets.

CHAPTER    X. 


1865, 


The  appearance  of  Osbert  Mordaunt  as  Secretary  in- 
fused new  life  into  F.  F.,  and  a  very  good  programme  was 
arranged,  which  began  on  May  24  and  25  at  Cambridge 
against  the  University.

On  June  5  F.  F.  played  BuUingdon,  and  F.  Inge  making 
52,  R.  Whittington  44,  and  T.  Gamier  40,  their  total 
was  169  against  118  made  by  BuUingdon,  who  then  lost 
3  wickets  for  48,  their  groundsman  twice  not  out. 

A  two  days'  match  with  Ch.  Ch.  only  gave  time  for  an 
innings  each — F.  F.  making  293,  Ch.  Ch.  299.  For  F.  F. 
F.  G.  Inge  scored  84,  Davenport,  Lyon,  and  L.  Garnett 
35  each,  CoUey  30,  Moseley  19,  Reay  18.  For  Ch.  Ch. 
Maitland  made  80,  O.  Mordaunt  58,  Boyle  40,  &amp;c. 

But  on  June  8,  B.  N.  C.  having  got  F.  F.  out  for  97, 
Davenport  26  being  the  best  scorer,  made  136  themselves 
for  9  wickets. 

On  June  23  Upper  Tooting  was  the  scene  of  some  good 
cricket  and  mirthful  minstrelsy.  F.  F.  made  172  to  114 
from  the  home  side — E.  Rutter  scoring  59,  T.  Ratlifif  35 
(not  out),  T.  O.  Reay  24 ;  but  on  their  second  essay  they 
only  attained  the  figure  of  52,  and  Tooting  made  23  for 
2  wickets. 

Haileybury  got  out  for  25  and  Z6,  so  as  F.  F.  had 
scored  iii  in  the  first  innings,  a  wide  in  the  second 
settled  the  matter.  F.  Lee  30,  R.  Brodie  26,  E.  Hume  24, 
were  the  chief  performers.  Ratliff's  slows  took  12  wickets, 
and  Brodie  6. 

At  Lord's,  on  July  4  and  5,  F.  F.  met  I  Z.  and  a  licking, 
for  which  they  are  indebted  to  a  splendid  innings  on  Mr 
Buller's  part,  and  some  bad  management  on  their  own.

And  on  the  20th  a  team,  described  in  the  book  as  a 
"scratch  lot,"  made  71  against  the  Civil  Service — M.  T. 
Martin  getting  28.  For  the  Opposition  A.  Rawlins  made 
112,  C.  Rawlins  62,  and  C.  Morgan  50  (out),  of  the  respect- 
able total  of  268. 

The  star  of  the  Foresters  was  certainly  not  at  this  period 
in  the  ascendant,  for  a  match  against  Gentlemen  of  the 
South  at  the  Oval  produced  another  discomfiture,  in  spite 
of  a  patient  innings  by  Buchanan,  who  went  in  first.  Had 
they  scored,  as  they  easily  might,  another  25  runs  the  first 
day,  the  match  would  have  been  drawn.  Buchanan, 
Taylor,  and  Ramsay,  were  the  chief  bowlers  for  F.  F.

At  Manchester  again,  on  July  27  and  28,  they  lost  their 
match  with  the  Western  Club,  being  short  of  men.  W.  G. 
Armitstead  26  and  76  (not  out)  was  the  best  performer 


86 


ABSENTEES. 


for  F.  F.,  who  scored  93  and  178.  The  Western  made  172 
and  loi  for  3  wickets,  J.  F.  Leese  being  54  (not  out)  at 
the  close. 

In  their  Scottish  tour  they  won  three  matches,  lost  one, 
and  drew  one. 

The  inconvenience  of  the  managers  being  both  absent 
on  tour  was  exemplified  by  the  imminent  collapse  of 
their  great  contest  against  the  County  of  Nottingham, 
when  only  ten  Foresters  out  of  fourteen  appeared  on  the 
ground — one  of  these,  Lyon,  with  his  arm  in  a  sling,  and 
Colley  also  disabled.  Mr  Williams,  however,  represented 
him  in  the  match,  and  D.  Pocklington  came  to  fill  the 
place  of  one  of  the  other  absentees.  Communications  from 
Ashley  Walker  and  Ratliff  arrived,  after  delays  in  trans- 
mission, when  the  game  was  over.  Fortunately  the  bowlers 
were  there,  and  this  was  sufficient  in  the  dull  sticky  weather 
which  ensued  to  give  the  Club  a  victory.

The  Foresters  now  went  on  to  Southwell,  and  beat 
Notts  Gentlemen  by  55  runs — S.  G.  Lyttelton  taking  10 
wickets  and  T.  C.  Goodrich  9  for  70  and  114.  F.  F.  got 
93  and  146,  Booth's  73  being  their  best  score. 

The  following  match  on  i8th  and  19th,  against  Rugby, 
they  lost  in  rather  curious  fashion.  The  School  fell  to 
Ratliff  and  Buchanan  for  65  runs — F.  F.  totalling  116, 
Martin  (not  out)  31,  Fetherston  26,  Boyle  23.  The  School 
then  got  125,  of  which  Pauncefote  made  70.     This  left  the

Foresters  75  to  get  to  win,  but  9  wickets  fell  for  33,  and  the 
eleventh  man  was  non  est,  probably  thinking  he  would  not 
be  wanted. 

The  last  match  at  Uppingham,  Sept.  20  and  21,  they 
won  by  36  runs — M.  T.  Martin  scoring  43  (not  out)  and  38, 
R.  H.  Colley  3  and  41,  C.  Marshall  6  and  29,  &amp;c. ;  totals 
102  and  158,  against  which  the  School  made  117  and  107 — 
J.  Fitzgerald  22  and  21,  C.  E.  Green  10  and  25,  being  their 
best  scorers.     Buchanan  took  10  wickets,  Ratliff  6.

At  Oxford  also,  on  June  5,  the  Club  got  rather  too 
many  runs  against  B.  N.  C. — C.  G.  Lyttelton  56,  C.  W.  S. 
Stanhope  55,  J.  S.  Holden  35,  &amp;c.,  making  225.  The 
College  had  6  wickets  down  for  132. 

Bullingdon,  the  next  day,  after  the  third  wicket  had  fallen 
for  36,  collapsed  for  51,  Buchanan  taking  5  wickets  and 
Reay  4;  then  Foresters  scored  136  for  6  wickets,  Reay 
claiming  36,  G.  Willes  30. 

On  the  7th  and  8th  Ch.  Ch.  scored  178  and  190,  in 
which  are  included  55  and  5  from  A.  H.  Smith  Barry, 
and  10  and  37  from  O.  Mordaunt,  against  144  from  F.  F., 
of  which  D.  Pocklington  made  5 1,  G.  H.  Tuck  28,  T.  O. 
Reay  26. 

At  Eton,  on  a  bowler's  wicket,  the  boys  on  the  9th  of 
June  won  by  14  runs  on  the  first  innings,  ^y  to  73,  Colley 
and  Tuck  being  the  only  double  figures  against  Ferguson's 
bowling;  thus  encouraged,  Eton  scored  124  for  3  wickets, 
Barrington  making  79.  Buchanan,  Mordaunt,  Hood,  and 
Mitchell  bowled  for  F.  F. 

The  Weybridge  match  on  the  i6th  they  won,  Brodie 
scoring  30,  Fetherston  33,  Colley  35,  T.  Ratliff  19  (not  out)  ; 
total  158.     The  School  made  82  and  68  for  4  wickets. 

The  Civil  Service  match  on  the  28th  was  won  also  by 
139  to  6^,  Osbert  Mordaunt  making  58.  Civil  Service  got 
46  runs  for  i  wicket  in  the  second  innings. 

Haileybury,  too,  on  the  29th  and  30th,  proved  a  win 
— 140  and  133  to  100  and  74.  E.  Rutter  26  and  40,  R. 
Brodie  20  and  36,  were  the  ledger-men. 

Upper  Tooting,  however,  inflicted  a  defeat  upon  July 
5,  Raynes  making  53  out  of  149;  while  A.  Hillyard  23 
(not  out)  and  17,  T.  O.  Reay  i  and  36,  were  the  best  of  a 
team  who  made  but  6S  and  84  for  6  wickets. 

On  July  9  and  10  Rugby  School  made  262  (W.  G. 
Goschen  75,  B.  Pauncefote  51)  and  75  for  3  wickets,  against 
F.  F.,  whose  single  innings  produced  221 — G.  L.  Marten  6^, 


PARODY.  91 

A.  Hillyard  43,  &amp;c.  E.  Ramsay  captured  7  wickets,  but 
was  absent  when  called  upon  to  bat. 

On  July  26  and  27  the  Foresters  were  very  nearly 
beaten  by  the  Western  Club  at  Manchester,  making  214  to 
the  home  side's  251,  and  then  losing  7  wickets  for  99  runs. 
E.  K.  Hornby  for  F.  F.  made  49  and  13,  C.  L.  Hornby  34 
and  28,  A.  H.  Smith  Barry  30  and  5,  W.  G.  Armitstead  32 
and  12.     Foresters  seem  to  have  been  short  of  men. 

Their  Scottish  tour,  July  31  to  Aug.  9,  produced  four 
wins  and  a  draw. 

On  Aug.  22  and  23,  the  Incogniti  beat  a  scratch  team 
of  F.  F.  at  Cannock  by  201  to  65  and  125 — A.  A.  Wilmot, 
who  made  7  and  30,  doing  best  for  F.  F. ;  Bott,  Coyney, 
and  C.  A.  Garnett  also  making  a  few  runs. 

If  the  second  day  at  the  Southwell  ground  had  not 
been  too  wet  to  play,  another  victory  would  have  been 
probably  added  to  the  Forester  list,  for  they  got  263 — 
Tennent  70,  Boyle  48,  Reay  47,  Brodie  34,  &amp;c. ;  and  when 
the  N.  C.  C.  went  in  they  lost  6  wickets,  5  to  Goodrich  and 
I  run  out,  for  16  runs. 

At  Thoresby,  where  an  aristocratic  patron  of  cricket, 
Earl  Manvers,  gave  them  a  right  noble  reception,  they 
just  drew  the  match  in  a  critical  position.  The  wicket 
was  all  that  could  be  desired.     As  a  parodist  observed — 

"  Prince's  and  Lord's  may  flourish  and  may  fade  ; 
Yield  to  the  plough,  the  level,  and  the  spade  : 
But  English  lawns  and  parks,  their  country's  pride, 
Will  for  the  noble  game  a  home  provide." 

Foresters  went  in  first  and  scored  150,  Pocklington  and 
Whittington  bowling  for  Thoresby,  the  first-named  taking 
4  wickets,  the  latter  5.  Brodie  was  best  scorer  with  51. 
"  The  noble  host,"  it  is  noted,  "  got  rid  of  Mordaunt  by  a 
capital  catch  off  Whittington."  Thoresby  then  took  their 
turn,  and  only  making  63,  had  to  follow,  when  they  mended 
their  hands,  and  claimed  152.     As  there  was  only  about 


92  RULES, 

an  hour  to  play,  F.  F.  tried  the  forcing  game,  but  unsuc- 
cessfully, for  they  had  7  wickets  down  for  40  at  the  close  ; 
Pocklington  again  claiming  3,  and  Whittington  4. 

In  bad  weather,  at  the  end  of  September,  they  beat 
Uppingham  in  one  innings,  by  141  to  52  and  56,  Buchanan 
taking  12  wickets,  and  S.  G.  Lyttelton  6;  and  the  same 
bowlers  the  next  day  disposed  of  5  Rugby  wickets  apiece 
for  51,  while  Free  Foresters  claimed  6Z  with  6  wickets 
down,  Ratliff  (not  out)  28.

CHAPTER    XII. 
1867. 

The  season  of  1867  does  not  appear  to  have  furnished 
very  much  whereof  to  boast.  Free  Foresters  existed,  and 
could  take  a  beating.  But  they  had  to  experience  the 
truth  of  a  stanza  once  quoted  as  a  motto  for  the  Club 
in  more  successful  days  : — 

"  Your  cricketing  boy,  full  of  teasers  and  twisters, 

Of  backing  well  up,  and  of  saving  the  run. 
May  talk  till  his  lingual  appurtenance  blisters 

Of  the  scores  he  has  made  and  the  matches  he's  won. 
We  feel  a  bit  bigger  when  scoring  a  figure. 

And  wearing  the  willow  as  it  should  be  worn  ; 
But  to  play  in  the  sun  till  you're  black  as  a  nigger, 

And  get  licked  after  all,  is  a  bit  of  a  thorn." 

It  was  a  transition  period  ;  the  old  generation  were  well- 
nigh  on  the  shelf,  and  the  new  one  had  hardly  arrived 
at  maturity :  all  the  more  honour  to  those  who  sustained 
the  old  "  United  though  Untied "  through  this  critical 
time. 

They  began  on  May  23  by  getting  beaten  at  Hampton 
Wick :  Free  Foresters  (with  four  absentees)  scoring  88 — 
Round  33,  Goodrich  23,  Entwisle  (not  out)  28 — and  the 
home  side  contriving  to  annex  112  against  the  bowling 
of  Goodrich  and  A.  R.  Kenney;  Anderson  27,  and  Ubsdell 
23,  being  the  prominent  scorers.

7  wickets.  "  The  bowling  of  E.  S.  Carter  was  most  effec- 
tive, no  less  than  twelve  of  the  Free  Foresters  being 
subdued  by  him."  The  premier  score  of  the  match  was 
made  by  R.  Brodie,  who  made  fifteen  singles,  one  4,  two 
3's,  and  the  same  number  of  2's  : —

Goodrich  and  his  boys  got  62  and  48  for  4  wickets,  with  the 
aid  of  Mr  Taylor,  who  made  37  runs  and  took  12  wickets. 

On  July  4  the  Civil  Service  inflicted  a  severe  defeat,  J. 
Kirkpatrick  accounting  for  9  wickets  and  C.  Morgan  for 
10 ;  F.  R.  Price  14  and  i,  J.  G.  Beevor  14  and  o  (not  out), 
C.  C.  Cotes  18  and  5,  H.  Bass  o  and  22,  A.  R.  Kenney  o 
(absent)  and  15,  being  the  chief  contributors  to  the  small 
totals  of  69  and  62.  The  Service  made  145 — S.  C.  Spencer 
Smith  24,  J.  Davies  18,  E.  L.  Bateman  24,  J.  Kirkpatrick 
17,  J.  W.  Martin  18  (not  out),  F.  H.  Short  14. 

At  Haileybury,  on  July  6,  the  School — with  the  aid  of 
65  from  E.  P.  Ash,  49  from  F.  E.  L.  Schreiber,  and  40 
from  A.  W.  C.  Young — made  an  innings,  of  253,  and  got 
out  F.  F.  for  157 ;  the  most  prominent  scorers  being  E.  J. 
Harper  31,  J.  M.  Yates  27,  R.  Brodie  27,  and  C.  Bill  15. 

Rugby  School  also,  on  July  8  and  9,  won  by  i  wicket, 
though  had  J.  H.  Raven  (43,  retired,  and  o,  absent)  been 
able  to  stay,  the  result  might  have  been  otherwise.  F.  F. 
got  128  and  175  ;  O.  Mordaunt  6  and  53,  W.  F.  Higgins 
21  and  50,  Y.  Paget  30  and  3,  and  G.  Bennet  o  and  22 


.     LORD'S.  99 

(not  out),  doing  best.  For  the  School,  F.  Tobin,  ma.,  75 
and  35,  W.  Yardley  16  and  53,  F.  Tobin,  mi.,  24  and  6, 
were  the  chief  contributors  to  a  score  of  177  and  128. 

At  Tooting,  July  10  and  11,  F.  F.  scored  159  and  172  to 
154  and  58  ;  E.  Rutter  33  and  30,  W.  F.  Higgins  6  and  50, 
R.  Brodie  18  (not  out)  and  27,  doing  best.  For  Tooting, 
Baggallay  made  29  and  4,  Wix  32  and  10,  &amp;c. 

Foresters  had  also  the  best  of  a  match  with  M.  C.  C, 
which  was  made  a  drawn  one  by  a  wet  second  day. 

Foresters  won  the  toss,  and  sent  in  Price  and  Baker.  Scothern 
and  Chatterton  were  the  bowlers  at  starting.  Both,  however, 
got  so  freely  hit  that  Mr  Fellows  was  called  on,  and  then  Mr 
Pickering.  When  the  score  had  advanced  to  120  Mr  Sutton 
relieved  Mr  Fellows,  and  at  146  Mr  Duntze  went  to  Mr  Picker- 
ing's end.  To  be  brief,  all  the  Foresters  hit  and  scored  regard- 
less of  bowlers,  or  how  they  changed  about.  The  innings 
occupied  five  hours,  and  averaged  nearly  50  runs  per  hour.  At 
the  close  of  the  day  Marylebone  had  lost  6  wickets  for  90  runs.

loo  THORESBY. 

A  tour  in  Nottinghamshire  produced  two  draws  and  a 
defeat.  Gentlemen  of  Notts  at  Beeston  scored  194  and 
150 — J.  G.  Beevor  making  79  in  the  first  innings  and  59 
(run  out)  in  the  second — against  Foresters  237.  A.  W.  T. 
Daniel  65,  M.  T.  Martin  70,  E.  Rutter  31,  G.  N.  Marten  27, 
T.  Rathff  15. 

At  Thoresby  Lord  Manvers'  eleven  defeated  them  by  4 
wickets,  Foresters  making  121  and  106;  M.  T.  Martin 
again  scoring  37  and  ii,  H.  N.  Tennent  33  and  11,  A.  W. 
Daniel  18  and  26.  For  the  House,  J.  J.  Sewell  scored  20 
and  45,  D.  Pocklington  15  and  29  (not  out),  R.  F.  Miles  o 
and  23  (not  out);  totals  109  and  119.  Rutter,  Daniel, 
Whittington,  and  Ratliff,  took  the  Thoresby  wickets ; 
Pocklington,  Miles,  and  Beevor  those  of  F.  F. 

The  third  match  was  against  Ratcliffe,  who  made  185 — 
G.  B.  Davy  44,  C.  Martin  30,  and  W.  Clements  25,  being 
the  best.  F.  F.  had  obtained  148  for  7  wickets  at  the  call 
of  time— M.  T.  Martin  with  6Z,  A.  W.  Daniel  28,  being  their 
leaders. 

They  won  a  match  at  the  ground  of  their  old  friends  the 
Western,  Manchester,  with  6  wickets  to  fall,  making  216 
and  66 ;  A.  W.  T.  Daniel  jj  and  (not  out)  33,  leading, 
followed  hand passibus  cequis  by  R.  T.  Whittington  38  and 
10  (both  not  out),  and  W.  F.  Higgins  34  and  3.  The 
Western  made  125  and  155 — V.  K.  Armitage  24  and  21,  J. 
Galbraith  o  and  37,  A.  Proudfoot  3  and  24,  A.  N.  Blair  23 
and  10,  being  their  best. 

Foresters  also  played  a  match  at  Shrewsbury  on  Aug. 
26  against  Christ  Church  Cardinals.  Owing  to  the  loss 
of  the  Shropshire  score-books,  I  am  unable  to  say  more  of 
this  match  than  that  it  was  drawn,  and  that  W.  Wingfield 
scored  30  for  F.  F.

CHAPTER    XIII. 
1868. 

It  was  at  the  conclusion  of  the  last  or  the  commence- 
ment of  the  coming  season  that  a  complaint  from  some 
country  cousin  of  the  advantage  which  he  supposed  the 
metropolitan  members  to  derive  from  the  annual  meeting 
being  held  in  London,  induced  the  acting  secretaries  to 
issue  a  circular  asking  for  nominations  in  writing  for  the 
Committee — a  measure  which  was  attended  with  very  satis- 
factory results,  inasmuch  as  the  majority  of  those  who 
took  the  trouble  to  write  supported  the  executive  as  then 
constituted.  One  eminent  Forester,  however,  sent  a  list 
which  indicated  a  very  radical  change.  His  communica- 
tion is  worth  preserving  verbatim  : — 

Caunton  Manor,  March  12. 

Dear  Mr  Secretary, — As  I  shall  be  unable  to  attend  the 
meeting  on  Wednesday,  I  forward,  as  you  request,  six  nominations 
for  our  future  Committee  : — 

Dr  Livingstone, 

Marie  Wilton, 

Beales,  M.A., 

Fortnum  &amp;  Mason, 

Sir  Watkin  Wynne, 
and  the  Christy  Minstrels,  so  long  as  they  abide 
by  their  present  intention  never  to  perform  out  of  London. — 
Faithfully  yours,  S.  Reynolds  Hole. 


I02  SCHOOLS. 

Foresters  won  a  good  match  with  Rugby  School  on  June 
I  and  2  by  5  wickets.  The  School  went  in  first  and  made 
124,  which  the  F.  F.  topped  by  5  runs  only,  and  then  got 
the  School  out  for  106,  Buchanan  and  Millington  bowling. 
H.  Verelst  22  and  (not  out)  37,  G.  N.  Marten  36  and  7, 
W.  Newport  34  and  5,  and  E.  M.  Wakeman  3  and  25,  were 
the  best  scorers  for  F.  F. ;  S.  K.  Gwyer  12  and  33,  W. 
Yardley  38  and  o,  and  S.  P.  Bucknill  29  and  20,  for  the 
School. 

Westminster  would  have  won  had  time  permitted.  F.  F. 
got  187— C.  G.  Lane  57,  G.  N.  Marten  23,  R.  Brodie  32, 
E.  Rutter  27,  W.  F.  Higgins  22.     The  boys  made  174  for 

5  wickets— F.  N.  Saunders  71,  and  R.  U.  Eddis  48,  being 
both  not  out. 

Cheltenham  drew  with  a  short  team  of  F.  F.,  getting  1 10 
and  257  to  147  and  93  for  4  wickets.  C.  B.  Filgate  3  and 
y6,  and  J.  J.  Reid  25  and  32  for  the  School,  S.  G.  Lyttelton 
15  and  42,  and  J.  M.  Yates  32  and  (not  out)  17,  for  F.  F. 
were  prominent.     Buchanan  took  14  wickets. 

Weybridge  School  won  outright,  absentees  again  being 
the  complaint.  F.  R.  Price  and  E.  Rutter  made  38  and  42 
out  of  the  98  scored  by  F.  F. ;  E.  F.  Taylor  34,  A.  Lips- 
comb 22,  and  H.  A.  Sealy  35,  of  the  132  credited  to  the 
School. 

On  July  9,  Civil  Service  inflicted  another  defeat,  making 
183  ;  J.  Kirkpatrick  (not  out)  43,  L.  C.  Abbot  29,  James 
Davies  25,  and  E.  P.  Thesiger  21,  being  to  the  fore.  F.  F. 
only  compiled  80;  W.  K.  Mott  16,  T.  Rathfif  10,  and  F. 
Baker  28,  being  the  only  double  figures. 

At  Haileybury,  on  July  14,  Foresters  beat  the  School  by 

6  wickets.  F.  R.  Price  60,  E.  Rutter  29,  C.  F.  Reid  21,  A. 
Lee  (not  out)  20,  and  B.  Pauncefote  19  were  the  chief  con- 
tributors to  their  score  of  189.  The  boys  only  got  122  and 
109  ;  A.  E.  Burr  45  and  o,  J.  Branton  Day  24  and  23,  T. 
Spens  19  and  20,  W.  P.  Brooke  o  and  39,  scored  best.

On  July  27  and  28  they  beat  the  Western  (Manchester) 
Club  by  9  wickets,  their  first  innings  reaching  226  ;  H.  N. 
Tennent  75  (not  out)  being  well  supported  by  H.  Verelst 
20,  Lionel  Garnett  17,  H.  Wyatt  20,  J.  Bennet  21,  and  W. 
H.  Richards  23.  The  Western  made  137  and  96;  R. 
Clayton  57  and  4,  Capt.  Marshall  86  and  17,  F.  W.  Wright 
4  and  18,  being  their  leading  batsmen. 

The  Scottish  tour  was  next  undertaken,  under  very  dif- 
ferent conditions  to  those  usually  experienced  north  of 
the  Tweed,  the  prolonged  drought  of  an  exceptionally 
hot  summer  having  affected  the  usually  over- luxuriant 
verdure  of  Scottish  parks.  Five  matches  were  played,  of 
which  Foresters  won  three,  drew  one,  and  lost  the  other. 

At  Manchester  again,  on  Aug.  14  and  15,  a  drawn  match 
was  played  against  the  Garrison,  who  scored  103  and  171  ; 
C  R.  Brander  24  and  70,  Dodson  15  and  49,  and  R.  Clay- 
ton 34  and  3,  distinguishing  themselves.  For  Foresters,  D. 
W.  Macdonald  6y,  Stewart  Garnett  52,  H.  Wyatt  32,  H.  G. 
Barron  21,  made  up  the  major  part  of  an  innings  of  210. 

On  the  24th  Aug.  F.  F.  began  a  week's  cricket  in  Notting- 
hamshire, drawing  a  match  at  Beeston  with  Gentlemen  of 
Notts,  who  made  163  and  276 — D.  Pocklington  6  and  90, 
G.  B.  Davy  26  and  57,  R.  F.  Miles  32  and  o,  &amp;c.  Foresters 
scored  173 — A.  W.  T.  Daniel  59  and  C.  Booth  51. 

Lord  Manvers'  match  proved  a  draw  also,  the  Thoresby 
eleven  making  172   and   193  with  5  wickets  down  ;  J.  G.

outs,  D.  Pocklington  5  and  27  and  R.  F.  Miles  8  and  35, 
making  it  hot  for  the  bowlers.  F.  F.  made  264 — R.  D. 
Walker  40,  A.  W.  T.  Daniel  66,  R.  Brodie  49,  T.  Ratliff 
(not  out)  55. 

The  remaining  match  at  Ratcliffe  (one  day)  was  won  by 
F.  F. ;  C.  Booth  80,  F.  Lee  40,  and  R.  T.  Whittington  30, 
with  a  few  other  contributions,  realising  205  against  147  of 
Ratcliffe,  for  whom  W.  Clements  62  did  best. 

A  fresh  campaign  was  inaugurated  at  Althorp  Park, 
Sept.  7  and  8,  but  Foresters  met  with  discomfiture  in  their 
first  essay,  Messrs  Kenney  and  Smith  taking  all  their 
wickets  for  37  and  1 1 1 — R.  D.  Walker  o  and  22,  A.  Lee  o 
and  19,  F.  Lee  7  and  16,  E.  M.  Riddell  2  and  16,  E. 
Rutter  5  and  14,  &amp;c.  Althorp  made  130 — Plumb  27, 
W.  F.  Higgins  21,  E.  M.  Kenney  21,  R.  L.  Parker  20 — 
and  won  by  8  wickets. 

At  Uppingham  F.  F.  reversed  the  spell,  and  scored  356 — 

E.  Hume  140,  F.  Lee  82,  G.  B.  Davy  65,  &amp;c. — against  the 
School,  who  only  put  on  72  and  124;  J.  Gibson  o  and  23, 
W.  Kidd  II  and  15,  P.  Kidd  6  and  20,  W.  Alexander  6 
and  17,  A.  Weldon  13  and  o,  C.  Helmsley  13  and  16,  being 
the  chief  scores. 

At  the  unusually  late  period  of  Michaelmas  an  eleven 
went,  as  some  one  cynically  observed,  "gooseying"  to 
Woburn,  where  they  beat  the  Gentlemen  of  Bedfordshire — 

F.  Lee  accounting  for  9  wickets,  E.  Rutter  for  1 1,  for  the 
moderate  scores  of  39  and  81.  Although  F.  Lee's  27  was 
the  chief  score  for  Free  Foresters,  and  they. were  all  out 
for  107,  they  had  no  difficulty  in  winning  by  10  wickets.

CHAPTER    XIV. 

1869. 

Some  difficulty  exists  at  this  period  of  the  history  of 
the  Club  in  obtaining  a  correct  record  of  their  matches. 
It  was  never  compulsory  upon  the  Secretary  to  preserve 
the  scores,  which  in  fact  were  not  always  forwarded  to  him 
by  the  managers,  nor  were  they  invariably  sent  to  the  press. 
The  recognised  channels  of  cricket  reports  were  at  that 
time  also  in  a  transitional  state,  so  that  the  scores  of 
matches  appeared  when  transmitted,  in  the  columns  some- 
times of  one  paper,  sometimes  of  another.  Still  the  frag- 
mentary notices  of  the  doings  of  Free  Foresters  will 
suffice  to  show  that  they  were  by  no  means  moribund,  even 
if  their  sphere  might  be  somewhat  restricted. 

A  good  match  was  played  at  Oxford  on  June  7  and  8: —

After  a  lengthened  period  of  estrangement  from  the 
scenes  which  originally  witnessed  their  formation,  Free 
Foresters  revisited  Warwickshire,  and  commenced  on  Aug. 
6  with  a  match  against  a  local  twenty-two  at  Sutton 
Coldfield,  whose  first  innings  only  reached  the  total  of  74. 
F.  F.,  playing  twelve  men,  then  scored  124,  R.  F.  Miles 
contributing  28,  Regd.  Garnett  22,  A.  Hillyard  20.     In  a 


WARWICKSHIRE    WEEK.  113 

second  attempt  the  home  side  showed  up  better,  having 
made  69  for  3  wickets,  Herbert  Garnett  (not  out)  42. 

During  the  next  week  the  matches  played  were  on  three 
grounds  where  for  a  series  of  years  the  Club  were  very 
much  at  home,  and  enjoyed  the  best  of  cricket  and 
hospitality. 

At  Elmdon  (Mr  W.  C.  Alston's)  Foresters  won  with 
129  and  187  to  75  and  98,  Miles  and  Price,  with  Gibbon 
and  Foster  as  a  change,  being  much  on  the  spot.  H. 
Verelst  43  and  33,  J.  H.  Gibbon  24  and  60,  and  Robert 
Garnett  o  and  35,  were  prominent  for  F.  F. ;  for  Elmdon 
W.  Smythe  8  and  25,  A.  Hillyard  21  and  13,  and  B.  T. 
Fetherston  25  and  5,  did  best. 

Mr  Bagot,  thanks  to  Rylott's  bowling,  and  a  fine  though 
fortunate  innings  of  yC  from  Mr  H.  W.  Gardner,  drew  the 
match  in  his  favour,  Pype  Hayes  counting  207  and  69  for 
3  wickets,  to  F.  F.  150  and  171,  S.  P.  Bucknill  being  the 
hero  of  the  occasion  with  37  and  27,  H.  Foster  scored  8 
and  44,  F.  R.  Price  i  and  37  ;  Ramsay  took  5  wickets. 

The  third  match  was  at  the  house  of  the  Hon.  E.  Parker 
Jervis,  where  a  Staffordshire  eleven  succumbed  to  Hillyard, 
Gibbon,  and  W.  G.  Armitstead  for  61  and  132 — M.  Graham 
25  and  12,  E.  W.  Burnett  9  and  32  ;  while  Foresters  made 
174,  and  won  by  7  wickets — A.  Hillyard  43  and  6,  R. 
Brodie  41  and  3,  and  G.  H.  Allsopp  26,  being  their  leading 
batsmen. 

During  this  period  the  Scottish  tour  was  going  on,  Mr 
Buchanan  being  manager.  The  matches  will  be  found  in 
the  chapter  devoted  to  these  events. 

A  match  not  on  the  programme  was  played  at  Burton- 
on-Trent,  Aug.  8  and  9,  against  an  eleven  of  the  Hon.  and 
Rev.  R.  Moncrieff's,  who  scored  189  and  81 — G.  M.  Robin- 
son 41  and  24  (not  out).  Free  Foresters  responded  with 
253 — J.  G.  Beevor  98 — and  won  by  ten  wickets. 

At  Woburn  on  the  30th  Aug.  they  beat  Bedfordshire,

who  made  77  and  140 — T.  S.  Pearson  19  and  27,  W.  Vyse 
25  and  21.  Foresters  claimed  130,  G.  Strachan  making 
63  (not  out)  and  Bull  13.  The  latter,  who  came  upon  the 
ground  on  horseback,  was  induced  to  put  on  pads,  but  not 
to  change  his  shoes  :  a  spur  caught  in  his  pad  in  turning 
for  a  second  run,  and  he  came  a  cropper.  F.  F.  had  little 
difficulty  in  winning  by  6  wickets — G.  Strachan  27  and 
R.  D.  Walker  22  being  not  out. 

An  eleven,  which  may  be  presumed  not  to  have  been 
very  strong  in  bowling,  was  kept  out  in  the  field  all  day  at 
Hams  Hall  on  the  14th  Sept.  by  Crusaders,  who  made  376 
— C.  J.  Brune  121,  A.  Hillyard  92. 

At  Newark  on  Sept.  19  F.  F.  finished  their  season  by 
obtaining  91,  of  which  E.  A.  Chester  made  26  and  T. 
Ratliff  28  (not  out),  against  84  for  Newark,  Rutter  and 
Mitchell  taking  the  wickets.  The  latter  made  31  (not  out) 
in  a  fragment  of  a  second  innings.

CHAPTER    XVI. 

1871. 

With  1871  begins  a  new  era  in  the  fortunes  of  the  old 
club.  A  discontented  veteran  was  indeed  heard  to  observe 
that  their  first  motto,  ''  United  though  Untied,"  had  been 
changed  into  "  The  Singers  go  before  "  ;  but  this  ebullition 
of  spleen  was  in  no  degree  justified  by  facts,  cricket  and 
good  fellowship  going  hand  in  hand  with  music  in  a 
harmonious  trio. 

The  first  match  at  Hastings,  May  11,  was  unfinished 
owing  to  the  long  scores  of  F.  F.,  who  totalled  298,  M. 
Turner  contributing  46,  E.  Hume  31,  H.  M.  Marshall  52, 
S.  G.  Lyttelton  39,  J.  Marsham  53,  T.  RatlifF44  (not  out). 
Against  this  Hastings  made  80  for  4  wickets — W.  Pope  39 
(not  out). 

On  the  22'd  and  23d  May,  at  Cheltenham,  they  fared 
worse.  The  boys  made  227,  of  which  F.  W.  Francis 
claimed  65.  F.  F.  then  scored  169 — F.  R.  Price  30,  G.  N. 
Wyatt  25,  J.  H.  Gibbon  29  (not  out) — and  got  the  School 
wickets  down  for  140;  but  when  5  wickets  had  made  81, 
time  was  called. 

On  June  7,  at  Oxford,  F.  F.  beat  Bullingdon  by  120,  with 
4  wickets  down,  to  109. 

On  June  20,  at  HiUingdon,  F.  F.  made  125 — R.  D.  Walker 
39,  D.  Moffat  24 ;  and  the  next  day,  at  Vincent  Square, 


Ii6  MUSIC, 

the  club  defeated  Westminster  School  by  132  to  'j'^,  the 
boys'  second  innings  realising  58  for  4  wickets. 

On  June  28,  at  Battersea,  F.  F.  scored  125  to  the  152  of 
Civil  Service,  5  of  whose  wickets  fell  in  the  second  innings 
for  47.  J.  H.  Berger  made  65  for  C.  S. ;  F.  Paget  36, 
G.  Tuck  29,  G.  Wyatt  26  for  F.  F. 

July  7  and  8  were  occupied  in  the  match  at  Shoebury- 
ness,  which  was  won  by  F.  F.,  the  Gunners  m.aking  82 
and  153 — Bomb.  Macpherson  playing  a  good  not -out 
innings  of  56.  Foresters  made  98  in  their  first  innings — 
H.  M.  Marshall  54,  and  E.  P.  Ash  21 — but  in  the  second 
innings  Turner  scored  57  (not  out),  Marshall  7,  Ash  (re- 
tired) 47,  E.  Rutter  21,  and  Francis  5  (not  out),  with 
extras  138;  and  on  July  10  and  11  met  Rugby  School, 
Foresters  making  253 — H.  M.  Marshall  71,  B.  T.  Fether- 
ston  50,  J.  Marsham  32,  E.  P.  Ash  21,  &amp;c.  Against  this, 
on  a  wet  second  day,  the  boys  made  86,  and  53  for  3 
wickets — G.  H.  Nash  19  and  28,  E.  L.  Curry  24  and  6 
(not  out). 

A  good  match  ensued  on  July  12  and  13  at  Southgate.

On  July  15,  a  capital  struggle  gave  Malvern  College  a 
majority  of  4  runs — Y,  F.  82,  Malvern  Z6 ;  F.  F.,  second 
innings,  93  for  7  wickets. 

At  Eccles,  July  17  and  18,  the  Western  Club  succumbed, 
making  only  53  and  Z6 — V.  K.  Armitage  2  and  30  (not  out) 
— in  response  to  166  and  124  from  F.  F.,  W.  Townshend 
scoring  52  and  66,  H.  G.  Barron  '^'j  and  19,  F.  R.  Price  23 
and  8. 

Liverpool,  on  the  two  days  following,  made  a  draw, 
obtaining  121  and  184  for  6  wickets,  against  F.  F.'s  163. 
For  Liverpool,  D.  Cunningham  30  and  42,  and  G.  Wild  23 
and  41,  were  prominent ;  for  F.  F.,  W.  G.  Armitstead  35, 
P.  H.  Mellor  34,  F.  R.  Price  18,  H.  Garnett  17. 

At  the  Node  on  the  3d  Aug.  the  home  side  made  144 ; 
but  the  Foresters,  with  8  wickets  down,  267. 

The  Scottish  tour  this  year  involved  six  matches — four 
won,  one  lost,  and  one  drawn. 

The  Warwickshire  week,  which  commenced  August  7, 
embraced  three  matches,  the  first,  at  Elmdon,  being  a 
drawn  one,  a  little  in  favour  of  F.  F.,  who  made  207 — G.  N. 
Wyatt  90  and  J.  H.  Gibbon  62  being  foremost.  Had 
Malcolm  Graham  not  stumbled  after  getting  a  gallery 
catch  right  into  his  hands,  and  so  dropped  the  ball,  it 
would  have  been  a  one-innings  affair ;  as  it  was,  the  home 
side  having  made  125  in  their  first  innings,  totalled  2  more 
in  the  second  for  8  wickets,  T.  Ratliff  47  and  7,  A.  Hillyard

DOUBTFUL. 


31  in  each  innings,  and  B.  T.  Fetherston  20  and  34,  being 
leaders. 

The  two  days  following  were  occupied  at  Pype  Hayes, 
where  the  house  eleven  comprised  Silcock  (the  Essex 
bowler),  by  whose  assistance  they  got  F.  F.  out  for  80 ; 
but  were  unable  to  better  that  total  by  more  than  6  runs. 
In  the  second  innings  F.  F.  scored  239,  their  best  per- 
formers being  J.  H.  Gibbon  23  and  45,  F.  R.  Price  20  and 
22,  E.  Rutter  5  and  33,  A.  Hillyard  7  and  57,  S.  P.  Buck- 
nill  5  and  41.  Rutter  and  Mordaunt  then  disposed  of  7 
wickets  for  56 — J.  Marshall  22  and  25,  and  J.  W.  Gardner 
39  and  5,  being  noteworthy. 

The  third  match,  on  the  Sutton  Ground,  they  lost  to 
Deddington  by  10  wickets,  F.  F.  getting  119  and  103 — 
J.  H.  Gibbon  35  and  4,  F.  R.  Price  24  and  11,  J.  W. 
Gardner  10  and  26,  H.  W.  Verelst  17  (not  out)  and  13, 
doing  best.  For  Deddington,  who  made  200,  T.  H. 
Hudson   48   and   J.   G.   Crowdy  69   deserve  remark. 

Foresters  beat  Gentlemen  of  Notts  at  Beeston,  August 
15  and  16,  by  10  wickets.

120  NOTTINGHAMSHIRE. 

Another  draw  took  place  at  Drayton  with  Gentlemen  of 
Northamptonshire  on  August  28  and  29.  Foresters  scored 
160  and  128,  S.  G.  Lyttelton  88  and  15,  E.  H.  Warner  17 
and  26,  and  V.  Ellis  37  and  o  (not  out),  distinguishing 
themselves.  For  the  Shire,  who  got  124  and  115  with  4 
wickets  to  fall,  W.  F.  Higgins  42  and  13,  J.  Marsham  5 
and  36,  FI.  B.  Upcher  21  and  ii,  and  H.  H.  Gillett  4  and 
31,  were  scorers. 

The  same  week  at  Higham  Ferrers  F.  F.  won  outright, 
making  168  and  122  to  their  antagonists'  133  and  ']'^\ 
E.  H.  Warner  63  and  8,  H.  W.  Gardner  22  and  19,  and 
E.  W.  Burnett  2  and  (not  out)  27,  were  to  the  fore. 

The  last  match  of  this  season  was  played  at  Newark, 
Notts,  on  September  6  and  8,  an  archery  contest  being 
sandwiched  between  the  two  days.  F.  F.  got  74  and  103, 
J.  Marsham  20  and  43  (retired)  being  the  champion.  The 
Langford  Club,  their  opponents,  got  120  and  22  for  3 
wickets.  There  was  probably  more  good  fellowship  than 
strict  cricket  upon  the  occasion,  as  evidenced  by  the  ludi- 
crous account  which  appeared  in  '  Forester  Chronicle '  : — 

In  an  ancient  manuscript  recently  discovered  amid  the  ruins 
of  the  once  famous  castle  of  Novus  Audi  or  "  New-hark,"  it  is 
recorded  that  at  some  remote  period  of  the  dark  ages  the  city 
suffered  from  the  inroads  of  a  race  of  wandering  barbarians,  clad 
in  uncouth  apparel,  and  wielding  clubs  of  peculiar  construction. 
The  chief  of  this  race  of  banditti  was  known  by  the  title  of  Old 
Tom,  either  by  hereditary  right,  or  from  a  corruption  of  the 
French  H Automne^  at  which  season  of  the  year  these  marauders 
were  wont  to  make  their  annual  appearance.  Tradition,  merging 
into  fable,  varies  on  the  subject  of  his  personal  appearance,  at 
one  time  asserting  that  the  figure  of  an  animal  of  the  feline  tribe, 
which  still  adorns  the  premises  of  licensed  victuallers,  was  ori- 
ginally intended  as  a  representation  of  this  redoubtable  chieftain  ; 
while  at  another,  with  more  probability,  he  is  depicted  as  an  in- 
dividual devoid  of  any  such  hirsute  adornment,  and  only  resem- 
bling the  symbolical  quadruped  in  the  gladsome  expression  of  his 
countenance.  History,  indeed,  does  not  bear  out  the  notion  of 
ferocity  as   associated   with   these   "Silvicolse  liberi,"  or  "Free 


''NOTORIOUSLY  PLEASANT."  121 

Foresters."  The  tribute  which  they  exacted  from  the  natives  was 
of  a  trifling  character,  consisting  merely  of  lodging  and  moderate 
refreshment,  enlivened  by  the  society  of  the  female  part  of  the 
community.  In  return  they  endeavoured  to  instruct  their  enter- 
tainers in  various  amusing  arts,  such  as  music  and  dancing,  but 
especially  in  a  "  mystery,"  now  long  forgotten,  called  cricket,  the 
nature  of  which  it  is  somewhat  difficult,  from  the  confused  and 
contradictory  descriptions  preserved  to  us,  to  discover  with  accu- 
racy. One  eminent  Free  Forester,  whose  name  we  decipher  as 
Marsham,  evidently  practised  it  with  some  reference  to  the  science 
of  astronomy,  for  we  read  of  his  "  star-gazing  innings."  That  it 
was  in  some  way  connected  with  a  ball  is  quite  clear,  or  rather 
that  balls  of  different  sizes  were  in  use,  as  the  prefix  wide  which 
frequently  accompanies  the  word  involves  the  fact  of  a  narrower 
species  of  ball  being  also  employed.  Whatever  the  nature  of  the 
pursuit,  it  appears  to  have  been  a  most  engrossing  one,  for  a 
"  score,"  or  schedule,  almost  obliterated  (probably  by  the  tears  of 
the  losing  side),  is  still  preserved,  in  which  the  titles  "  Mrs  "  and 
"  Miss  "  accompany  the  names  of  the  most  efficient  bowleuscs  and 
redoubtable  batsmen,  or  perhaps  batswomen.  The  date  of  this 
latter  cricketalian  celebration  we  have  no  difficulty  in  fixing  as 
the  7th  September  1871,  though  the  date  of  the  match  of  which 
the  score  is  appended  is  open  to  doubt,  inasmuch  as  the  historian, 
"  Regulus  tenet  totus,"  ^  from  whom  we  have  extracted  much  of 
the  foregoing  dissertation,  records  in  medieval  or  canine  Latin  an 
oration  made  to  the  nomads  by  one  "  Rector,"  probably  the  pilot 
who  steered  them  up  the  reaches  of  the  Trent.  In  order  that  the 
reader  may  form  his  own  opinion,  we  append  the  speech  :  "  Quae 
cum  ita  sint,  silvicote  liberi,  ad  meam  vocem  aures  arrigite.  Sunt 
in  hoc  aevo  duo  monstra  horrenda,  quibus  certamina  cricketaha, 
nisi  ipsa  diruta  sint,  omnino  destruentur.  Hoc,  malum  infestum, 
accrescens,  superjectio  dictum;  quum  in  loco  hominum  adcampum 
telegrammata  accedunt ;  res  a  viris  conjunctissimis  etsi  solutis  ab- 
horrenda.  Illud,  in  .campo  laxitas,  omissiones,  deprehendendi 
impotentia,  ab  lusoribus  spectatoribusque  deprecanda !  Necnon, 
fratres,  ad  exemplum  majorum  respectate.  His  ungulae  corne- 
scentes,  his  paxilli  celeres.  Horum  famam  respicientes,  ite  qua 
gloria  vos  expectat,  vociferantes — '  nunquam  morior  dicite.'  "

CHAPTER    XVII. 

1872. 

The  stormy  inifluence  which  pervaded  the  sky  during 
this  year  interfered  not  a  little  with  cricket  throughout ; 
nevertheless  it  was  a  season  full  of  interest  in  various 
ways.  It  was  resolved  to  try  the  experiment  of  a  dinner 
on  the  day  of  the  annual  meeting  ;  and  this  was  carried 
out,  though  scarcely  with  as  much  success  as  had  been 
anticipated — not  more  than  a  dozen  members  attending — 
at  the  St  James's  Hall  Restaurant  on  March  22. 

F.  F.  took  the  field  at  Cheltenham,  where  the  match  was 
drawn  owing  to  wet — "  cold  incessant  showers  on  the  first 
day,  and  heavy  rain  on  the  second."  F.  F.  made  80 ;  the 
College  120  for  three  wickets. 

At  Hillingdon,  on  May  27,  F.  F.  lost,  scoring  only  65,  of 
which  R.  D.  Walker  compiled  27  ;  Rutter  took  6  Forester 
wickets.  Hillingdon  made  72  and  69 — A.  Rutter  con- 
tributing 16  and  4,  E.  Rutter  5  and  20;  Walker  took  9 
wickets,  Novelli  5. 

At  Canterbury  on  the  3d  June  they  stayed  in  until  a 
thunderstorm  broke  up  the  game  ;  nevertheless  they  made 
a  total  of  179— F.  Crgwder  36,  N.  G.  Lyttelton  27,  H.  M. 
Marshal],  23,  &amp;c. — against  which  on  the  second  day  the 
Cathedral  city  could  only  show  71   and  47. 

On  the  5th  and  6th,  at  the  Mote,  Maidstone,  the  home 
team,  by  the  aid  of  38  from  John  Marsham,  scored   100,  a

number  which  F.  F.,  despite  43  from  K.  M.  Mackenzie, 
fell  short  of  by  I.  In  the  second  innings  the  Mote  made 
114,  and  F.  F.  64  for  one  wicket — Crowder  (not  out)  40. 

F.  F.  then  won  a  match,  of  which  the  score  has  not  been 
preserved,  at  Sevenoaks  Vine. 

The  Civil  Service  match  on  June  25  was  interfered 
with  by  rain.  C.  S.  scored  119  for  8  wickets.  F.  F.  did 
not  bat. 

At  Deddington,  on  the  3d  and  4th  July,  Foresters 
laboured  under  the  absentee  plague,  and  were  beaten  by 
3  wickets :  it  was  quite  a  bowler's  match,  F.  F.  only 
making  120  in  both  innings — F.  Crowder,  4  and  33,  being 
best.  Rutter  took  7  wickets  of  Deddington,  Law  8, 
Colmore  2. 

At  Southgate,  July  10  and  11,  the  match  was  drawn 
after  a  close  and  interesting  finish.

At  Rugby,  July  15  and  16,  the  School  made  two  innings 
of  81  runs  each,  L.  Jeffery  28  and  2,  and  E.  P.  Barlow 
17  and  10,  being  best  scorers.  Buchanan  took  11  wickets, 
Ellis  7.  F.  F.  reckoned  97  for  their  first  innings,  nobody 
making  20  runs,  and  in  the  second  only  scored  34,  Jeffery, 
Francis,  and  Ridley  bowling  them  out.  H.  W.  Gardner 
did  best  with  16  and  17.  On  the  other  hand,  at  Malvern 
they  won  easily,  Ashley  Walker  43,  Malcolm  Graham  45, 
and  F.  R.  Price  30,  being  the  leading  figures  in  a  score  of 
205.  The  boys  scored  60  and  120,  A.  H.  Stratford  10  and 
39  ;  Hull,  Walker,  and  F.  Garnett  bowled. 

At  the  Old  Trafford  ground  a  very  interesting  match 
against  Gentlemen  of  Lancashire  was  associated  with  a 
disaster  to  W.  G.  Armitstead,  which,  while  it  robbed  the 
Club  of  his  companionship  and  cricket  in  some  measure, 
was  the  cause  of  the  introduction  of  a  most  valued 
member  to  their  ranks,  as  Appleby  kindly  volunteered 
to  take  Armitstead's  place  in  the  match  the  same  week 
at  Birkenhead.  Armitstead's  accident  is  thus  described 
by  an  eye-witness  : — 

He  started  to  run,  turned  back,  and  then  quickly  started  again, 
fell,  got  up,  but  immediately  fell  again.  I  was  sitting  with  his 
brother  Henry  at  the  time,  and  W.  G.  came,  with  assistance 
hopping  off  the  ground,  and  sat  down  by  us  for  a  few  minutes ; 
but  being  strongly  recommended  to  go  and  see  what  was  the 
matter,  after  laughing  and  talking  for  some  time,  he  went,  and  a 
surgeon  on  the  ground  pronounced  the  "Achilles  Tendon" 
snapped  in  two,  and  that  he  would  be  on  his  bed  or  sofa  for 
some  weeks,  and  not  have  the  full  use  of  it  again  for  probably 
two  years.  I  only  hope  it  may  not  prove  so  bad  after  further 
examination.  On  going  away  he  said,  "  I  have  played  my  last  inn- 
ings, Houson !  "

Armitstead  wrote  soon  after  to  me  : — 

I  remember  me  of  my  Horace,  and  I  must  hang  up  my  bat 
and  pads  on  my  study  wall  with  the  familiar  stanza  : 

"  Vixi  duellis  nuper  idoneus 
Et  militavi  non  sine  laiidibus  ; 
Nunc  arma  defunctumque  hello 
Mt  bacuhim  hie  paries  habitat. " 

I  really  was  fit  enough.     You  see  I  have  softened  the  gloria — 
that  is  native  modesty. 


During  the  remainder  of  the  week  F.  F.  beat  the  West- 
ern by  5  wickets,  the  Western  scoring  70  and  143 — Capt. 
Jervis  36  and  8,  H.  A.  H.  Hulton  2  and  54,  L.  Garnett  5, 


126  DELUGES. 

and  31.  The  Foresters'  first  innings  was  j6 — J.  R.  Hutchi- 
son 22  ;  in  their  second,  W.  Townshend  was  (not  out)  61 
and  A.  M.  Watson  30,  C.  G.  O.  Bridgeman  15  and  24  (not 
out).  F.  F.  beat  Birkenhead  also  by  52  runs,  Appleby, 
Hutchison,  and  Bridgeman  bowling.  F.  F.  scored  175  and 
90 — L.  Garnett  (not  out)  47  and  2,  W.  Townshend  36  and  8, 
F.  R.  Price  27  and  6,  J.  Garnett  i  and  27  (not  out),  &amp;c. 
Birkenhead  claimed  124  and  89,  C.  S.  Gordon  44,  the  best 
score. 

The  Scottish  tour  this  year  comprised  six  matches,  four 
of  which  F.  F.  won  outright  and  drew  the  other  two. 

While  these  were  in  progress  a  week  in  Warwickshire 
proved  a  great  success  socially,  but  the  cricket  was  almost 
ruined  by  stormy  weather.  At  Pype  Hayes,  where  F.  F. 
began,  they  only  got  through  in  two  days  a  couple  of 
Forester  innings  for  JJ  and  62,  no  one  making  an  indi- 
vidual score  of  20,  while  the  home  side  only  managed  one 
innings  of  60.  The  next  day,  Aug.  7,  at  Elmdon,  when  6 
wickets  had  fallen  on  the  home  side  for  109 — T.  Ratliff 
33,  and  B.  Fetherston  29 — such  a  deluge  descended  that 
the  match  was  abandoned. 

On  Aug.  9  and  10,  at  Little  Aston  Hall,  F.  F.  beat 
Staffordshire  gentlemen  by  9  wickets  (twelve  a-side),  the 
County  scoring  52  and  102 — M.  Graham  20  and  2,  W.  W. 
Bagot  4  and  27,  H.  S.  Chinn  2  and  17  (not  out),  being 
chief  scorers;  Hillyard,  who  took  9  wickets.  Ash  8,  and 
Chambers  2,  being  F.  F.  bowlers.  The  Club  scored  85  and 
70 — E.  P.  Ash  35  and  6,  J.  Roughton  10  and  25  (not  out), 
L.  Garnett,  7  and  18  (not  out). 

Thence  to  the  adjoining  county  of  Worcester,  where 
F.  F.  lost  to  the  County  team  by  6  wickets,  scoring  108 
and  6"^  ;  E.  M.  Kenney  13  and  21,  and  H.  Verelst  24  and 
7,  being  noteworthy.  Against  the  bowling  of  Kenney, 
Ratliff,  and  Chambers,  the  County  made  142 — A.  T.  Lyt- 
telton  28  and  H.  Foster  29  being  the  best.

The  match  with  Notts  Gentlemen  was  left  drawn  on  a 
batsman's  wicket,  the  County  getting  203  and  233  ;  S.  H. 
Miles  68  (not  out)  and  o,  A.  W.  Cursham  40  and  o,  C.  T. 
Ashwell  II  and  58  (not  out),  J.  G.  Beevor  19  and  43,  E. 
M.  H.  Riddell,  5  and  37,  helping  the  score.  F.  F.  had  an 
innings  of  201,  H.  H.  Gillett  making  y^^,  H.  Verelst  39,  F. 
R.  Price  23  ;  and  Ashley  Walker  and  M.  T.  Martin  went 
in  and  made  32  when  time  was  called. 

At  Thoresby  the  match  was  lost — under  the  circum- 
stances recorded  in  the  appended  score.  Mr  Reid  contri- 
butes a  reminiscence  of  this  match  of  some  interest : — 

At  Lord  Manvers's  place  at  Thoresby,  the  F.  F.  always  were 
warmly  welcomed.  The  house  was  a  very  large  one,  and  the 
cricket-ground  was  kept  in  excellent  order,  and  the  scoring  as  a 
rule  was  very  big.  Of  course,  in  the  days  I  am  writing  about, 
the  "  Closure  "  Act  was  not  in  force  :  if  my  memory  serves  me 
correctly,  a  wicket  could  have  been  pitched,  and  a  good  wicket 
too,  on  any  portion  of  the  ground ;  so  one  expected,  and  not  in 
vain,  for  the  ball  to  come  true  to  one  in  the  field.  I  only 
played  there  on  one  occasion,  and  both  sides  were  strong ;  but 
the  batting  on  such  a  perfect  wicket  was  a  trifle  in  the  ascen- 
dant. Our  best  bowlers  were  being  unceremoniously  treated  by 
^'Mit"  Riddell,  at  that  time  a  first-rate  batsman,  and  we  were 
rather  in  a  hole.  I,  bashful  at  times,  plucked  up  courage  and 
said  to  the  captain,  "  If  you  really  want  a  wicket,  I  know  the 
man  who  can  get  one."  He  said,  "Who?"  I  took  the  ball  up 
and  said  to  the  umpire,  "  Round  the  wicket,  please."  Before 
the  situation  was  thoroughly  realised,  I  heard  the  captain  say, 
"Oh,  let  old  Snowball  have  one  over  ! "  The  Rev.  H.  H.  Gil- 
lett —  one  of  Bob  Thoms's  "  gentle  tappers  "  —  received  the 
first  ball  from  me,  and  I  said  to  Crowder,  "  Jog,  go  out  deeper." 
He  said  "  I  won't ;  I  am  deep  enough."  I  replied,  "  You  shall ! 
— a  bowler  ought  always  to  place  his  own  fieldsmen."  So 
"  Jog  "  did  what  he  was  told  to  do,  and  wxnt  out  "  in  the  coun- 
try,"— almost  out  of  sight, — and  I  proceeded  to  deliver  the  ball, 
about  the  sample  of  a  ball  I  usually  delivered.  I  had  a  choice  of 
a  long-hop  to  the  off  or  a  half-volley  to  the  leg,  and  this  time  the 
half-volley  turned  up  trumps ;  the  Rev.  H.  H.  G.  ("  Slinger  " — 
though  I  ought  not  to  dare  to  call  him  so)  opened  his  shoulders 
and  hit  the  ball  on  the  on-sid^ — the  hit  was  honestly  worth 
^'fifteen."     Boundaries  were  then  more  or  less  unknown,   but 


128 


A    VOLUNTEER. 


"  Jog  "  was  equal  to  the  occasion ;  a  wild  rush,  a  frantic  stoop, 
and  he  clutched  the  ball  with  his  left  hand  an  inch  or  two  from 
the  ground.  I  have  seen  many  a  good  catch  in  my  time,  and 
hope  to  see  many  more ;  but  I  always  think  that  was  the  very 
best  I  ever  saw.  Gillett,  after  hitting  the  ball,  came  to  my  end, 
and  was  turning  for  the  second  run,  when  I  gently  touched  him, 
and  I  said,  "  You're  out,"  and  he  "  smole,"  but  he  was  out.  I 
finished  my  over,  and  was  confidently  expecting  to  be  kept  on 
for  at  least  half  an  hour,  but  I  was  told  I  had  done  what  was  re- 
quired, and  had  better  go  back  to  my  old  place — mid-off ;  it  was 
what  I  supposed  would  be  the  upshot — F.  F.  gratitude  !  When 
I  told  the  rest  of  the  field  that  had  it  not  been  for  me  we  should 
never  have  got  Gillett  out,  they  wore  a  curious  expression  on  their 
faces  and  said,  "  Oh  no  !  perhaps  not,  but  you  had  better  have  a 
rest ! "  Next  day  Gillett  and  I  were  again  opposed,  at  Higham 
Ferrers ;  but  this  time,  when  he  came  to  the  wicket,  I  said,  "/ 
am  going  on,  whether  any  one  likes  it  or  not ;  Jog,  go  to  the 
old  place — tve  can  work  'Slinger'  between  us."  The  old  half- 
volley  to  leg,  the  old  tremendous  hit,  the  old  fine  catch,  and 
of  course  the  old  F.  F.  gratitude  !  I  have  never  since  bowled 
to  Gillett ;  but  with  Crowder  at  long-leg,  and  a  sufficiently  large 
ground,  I  feel  convinced  that  even  now  I  could  defeat  him.

CHAPTER    XVIII. 

1873- 

This  year  began  with  a  dinner  on  March  28,  the  opera- 
tions in  the  tented  field  being  commenced  two  months 
later  at  BuUingdon,  where,  when  the  Oxford  Club  had 
completed  an  innings  for  113, — A.  V.  Harcourt  38,  the 
premier  batsman, — 8  F.  F.  wickets  were  down  for  126 — 
W.  Evetts  (not  out),  58.

Price  31,  C.  Booth  and  W.  F.  Higgins  each  27,  R.  G. 
Venables  20  ;  and  then  got  the  Gunners  out  for  91  and 
132,  so  that  they  easily  won  by  9  wickets. 

The  Civil  Service,  on  June  25,  won  by  16  runs,  scoring 
144  to  Free  Foresters'  128;  in  the  second  innings  F.  F.

The  Warwickshire  matches,  which  commenced  at  Mr 
Alston's  on  Aug.  2,  were  unusually  successful. 

"  There  are  few  things  within  this  happy  reahn  done 
So  well  as  lunch,  chaff,  wickets,  runs,  at  Elmdon." 

The  Hall  eleven,  with  104  from  W.  H.  Wright  and  56 
from  J.  R.  Walker,  totalled  249,  and  time  only  allowed 
Frank  Wright  to  lose  his  wicket  to  his  namesake  (whom 
he,  be  it  noted,  had  before  c  and  b)  for  66,  leaving  Gibbon 
not  out,  and  106  runs  up. 

Pype  Hayes  scored  64  and  140,  J.  W.  Gardner,  as 
beforetime  in  this  match,  being  best  with  22  and  39. 
W.  H.  Wright  scored  8  and  48  (not  out).  E.  W.  Burnett 
13  and  23  (not  out),  H.  Verelst  31,  for  F.  F.,  whose  first 
innings  amounted  to  125  ;  so  they  won  with  2  wickets 
down. 

At  Sutton  Coldfield,  Aug.  6  and  7,  F.  F.  made  an  innings 
of  223  against  Deddington — W.  H.  Wright  again  to  the 
fore  with  50,  E.  W.  Burnett  39,  W.  G.  Armitstead  (re- 
covered from  his  accident)  33,  S.  P.  Bucknill  (not  out)  the 
same  number,  &amp;c.  Except  A.  Bradshaw,  who  scored  14 
and  36,  nobody  did  much  for  Deddington,  RatlifF  taking 
9  wickets  in  the  first  innings  and  5  in  the  second.  Scores 
6'j  and  yj. 

The  County  Gentlemen  of  Stafford  were  also  beaten 
at  Little  Aston  in  an  innings,  making  only  42  and  85  ; 
while  F.  F.  scored  194 — G.  M.  Robinson  40,  T.  S.  Pear- 
son 30,  H.  M.  Marshall  28.  T.  Ratliff  was  out  "  handled 
ball."  Pearson  took  9  wickets,  3  of  which  were  caught 
by  Appleby,  who  claimed  5  more,  from  his  own  bowl- 
ing. 

On  Aug.  1 1  F.  F.  encountered  the  formidable  Hawkstone 
combination,  and  lost  by  8  wickets.

In  the  second  innings  I.  D.  Walker  (c  S.  Lyttelton,  b  Armitstead)  scored  37, 
J.  Dale  (not  out)  29,  J.  Marshall  (not  out)  2,  F.  C.  Cobden  (c  Armitstead,  b  S.

On  the  14th  and  15th  they  drew  with  Alton  Towers, 
who  scored  82  and  178 — A.  Cotterill  7  and  45,  H.  S.  Reade 
26  and  o,  W.  M.  Coyney  18  and  19,  F.  Cotton  5  (not  out)

At  Beeston,  on  Aug.  18  and  19,  F.  F.  won  by  10  wickets. 
They  went  in  first  and  scored  238— F.  W.  Wright  con- 
tributed 90,  F.  Crowder  43.  It  was  then  discovered  that 
the  man  who  had  marked  out  the  ground  had  mistaken 
the  bowling-crease  at  one  end  for  the  popping-crease,  and 
so  added  the  length  of  the  crease  to  the  distance  between

35 


wickets.  This  was  rectified,  and  Notts  went  in,  but  were 
got  out  for  136,  and  the  follow-on  produced  118.  Gillett 
took  8  Notts  wickets,  Rutter  7,  Higgins  2. 

Wet  prevented  a  victory  over  South  Derbyshire  on  the 
20th.  The  County  made  50,  F.  F.  243,  with  a  wicket  to 
fall— H.  H.  Gillett  7^,  F.  Crovvder  (not  out)  52,  F.  W. 
Wright  37. 

A  similar  fate  attended  a  match  at  Uppingham  on  Sept. 
9  and  10,  where,  one  day  being  wet,  the  boys  scored  124 — 
D.  Q,  Steel  and  W.  S.  Patterson  34  each — and  7  wickets  of 
Foresters  were  down  for  130 — L.  W.  Novelli  43  (not  out). 
Buchanan  bowled  9  wickets.

CHAPTER    XIX. 
1874. 

The  season  began  with  a  match  at  Hillingdon,  June  8. 
In  each  of  their  innings  F.  F.  fell  10  runs  short  of  a  cen- 
tury. S.  G.  Lyttelton  21  and  8,  and  F.  W.  Wright  18 
and  36,  were  their  best  men.  The  villagers  made  84  and 
23  for  4  wickets.  S.  Lyttelton  took  7  wickets,  V.  E. 
Walker  4. 

On  the  19th  and  20th,  at  Sevenoaks  Vine,  Free  Foresters

Chamberlayne  took   13  wickets.  Bray  9. 

On  the  22d  and  23d,  at  Marlborough,  Free  Foresters

Ratlifif  1 14,  E.  Rutter  65,  R.  Entwistle  20  (not  out).  The 
second  innings  of  R.A.  only  amounted  to  29  (no  extras) — 
Captain  Gyll  14  (not  out).     Pearson  took  8  wickets. 

On  July  I  they  encountered  Civil  Service  and  made

out),  H.  M.  Marshall  23.  Eight  wickets  of  Civil  Service

,"Mr  Buchanan,  as  the  score  will  show,  was  as  usual 
destructive  with  the  ball,  whilst  a  sparkling  right-hand 
catch  that  he  made  fairly  electrified  his  side,  and — we  had 
almost  added — himself  too.  He  was  ably  seconded  by 
Mr  Francis,  whose  bowling,  coupled  with  pace,  was  well 
on  the  spot." 

On  July  13  and  14,  Liverpool  beat  F.  F.,  for  whom 
L.  O.  Garnett  made  27  and  3,  J.  H.  Gibbon  18  and  22 
(not  out),  helping  the  totals  of  no  and  75.  Liverpool 
scored  171  and  won  by  10  wickets — H.  P.  Stedman,  63  and 
13  (not  out),  being  the  best.

SCOTLAND  AT  RUGBY. 


July  15  and  16,  at  Birkenhead,  F.  F.  reversed  the  spell, 
getting  the  Park  out  for  131  and  149 — Richardson  56  (not 
out)  in  the  first  innings,  and  Crowther  74  in  the  second — 
owing  to  the  bowling  of  Barron  (8  wickets)  and  Royle 
(10  wickets).  Then  Foresters,  who  had  made  162  in  their 
first  essay,  scored  119  for  4  wickets — Hutchison  32  and 
13,  Royle  7  and  30  (not  out),  Gardner  47  and  43,  Venables 
20  and  16  (not  out),  and  Armitstead,  20  and  3. 

On  July  17  and  18,  at  Eccles,  Free  Foresters  lost  to 
their  old  friends  the  Western  Club,  making  64  and  188 
from  the  bowling  of  three  of  the  Garnett  family  (L.,  L.  O., 
and  S.) — J.  R.  Hutchison  7  and  56,  H.  W.  Gardner  o  and 
40,  R  Mellor  14  and  22,  J.  Law  4  and  27,  and  W.  G. 
Armitstead  17  and  i,  being  recognisable  scorers.  For  the 
Western,  who  won  by  5  wickets,  L.  O.  Garnett  9  and  6j 
(not  out),  and  J.  M.  Yates  47  and  o,  were  prominent. 

On  July  14,  at  Chiselhur^t,  Foresters  were  beaten  by 
West  Kent,  who  scored  132  to  102  and  96  from  the 
visitors — E.  Bray  38  and  14,  G.  Law  19  and  21,  being 
the  best  F.  F. 

The  match  with  Rugby  School  did  not  take  place  ;  but 
on  July  17  and  18  a  victory  was  obtained  on  the  Rugby 
ground  over  an  eleven  from  beyond  the  Border.

July  20  and  21,  at  Brookwood  Park,  Foresters  suc- 
cumbed to  Gentlemen  of  Hants  under  the  captaincy  of 
Clement  Booth.  Hants  made  198  and  228 — G.  P.  Green- 
field 54  and  26,  W.  J.  Kendle  o  and  62&gt;.  Foresters,  with 
a  couple  of  absentees  in  the  second  innings,  could  only 
compile  169  and  104 — S.  G.  Lyttelton,  53  and  o,  being 
their  best  performer. 

On  the  two  next  days,  again,  they  were  beaten  at 
Chichester,  Priory  Park  playing  Fillery,  who  took  13  F.  F. 
wickets.  F.  R.  Price  30  and  3,  W.  H.  Hadow  23  and  4, 
S.  G.  Lyttelton  31  and  8,  E.  Bray  13  (not  out)  and  12 
helped  the  modest  totals  of  134  and  50.  P'or  Chichester, 
who  made  86  and  loi  for  i  wicket,  A.  T.  Fortescue  7  and 
44  (not  out),  and  C.  Howard  41  and  44  (not  out),  dis- 
tinguished themselves. 

The  Malvern  match,  played  on  the  College  ground,  July 
29  and  30,  was  productive  of  a  surprise.  Foresters  went 
in  first  and  made  221 — R.  Garnett,  59,  A.  G.  Lee  54,  T.  P. 
Jervis  30,  H.  Foster  27,  J.  H.  Gibbon  23.  When  the 
School's  turn  came  it  occurred  to  a  charitably  disposed 
captain  to  give  them  a  chance  by  putting  on  to  bowl  a 
young  member  of  the  team,  whose  chief  recommendation 
was  that  he  did   not  bowl  for  his   coUeg-e.      The  novice 


I40 


THE  LAST  OF  HAWKSTONE. 


duly  delivered  his  first  ball  and — took  a  wicket.  The 
next  man  went  in,  and  ball  number  two  dismissed  him 
also !  In  fine,  the  boys  got  out  for  109  and  47,  W.  C.  R. 
Bedford  claiming  1 1  wickets,  A.  L.  Vernon  6.  Scott  34 
and  9,  Newby  34  and  o,  Read  26  and  9,  and  Colt  i  and  19 
(not  out),  were  the  only  double  figures. 

The  Newark  match,  played  30th  and  31st  July,  was  also 
a  thoroughly  sensational  one.  Going  in  first,  Free  Fores- 
ters were  disposed  of  for  74  runs,  of  which  H.  W.  Verelst 
made  27,  G.  Law  21.  Newark  then  obtained  a  total  of 
162— A.  A.  Wilmot  66,  E.  M.  H.  Riddell  37.  When  the 
F.  F.  began  their  second  innings,  T.  S.  Pearson  and  E.  F. 
S.  Tylecote  stayed  at  the  wickets  until  the  first  was  out 
1  b  w  186,  and  the  second  run  out  for  166, — the  total 
innings  being  393.     Newark  then  made  49  for  4  wickets. 

The  Scottish  tour  will  be  found  in  its  place.  It  began 
Aug.  3. 

Aug.  4  to  7,  a  Forester  team  played  at  Chelford  and 
Alton  Towers.  Rain  spoiled  the  match  v.  Cheshire,  as 
when  the  county  (one  man  short)  had  made  131,  F.  F. 
scored  88  for  2  wickets,  and  it  had  to  be  abandoned. 

At  Alton  rain  again  robbed  them  of  victory,  as  after 
the  Alton  eleven  had  scored  128  to  Foresters'  126 — A.  N. 
Hornby  34  and  J.  G.  Beevor  19 — Mr  Fryer  disposed  of 
the  10  Staffordshire  wickets  in  the  second  innings  for  ij. 

At  Hawkstone,  Aug.  10  and  11.  Weather  wet  and

Havvkstone  won  by  9  wickets  ;    Foresters  played   only 
ten  men. 

This  was  the  last  of  the  matches  played  at  the  invitation 
of  that  excellent  sportsman  the  late  Geoffrey  Hill  on  the 
Hawkstone  ground,  where  not  cricket  only  but  many 
other  sporting  achievements  came  off.  In  1873,  A.  N. 
Hornby,  R.  D.  Walker,  and  others  of  the  home  eleven 
amused  themselves  by  catching  the  silver-grey  rabbits  of 
which  the  Park  was  full,  and  cramming  them  alive  into 
their  woollen  jerseys.  The  fun  came  to  its  climax  when  a 
well-known  cricketer  altered  the  centre  of  gravity  and  fell 
on  his  face  on  the  top  of  the  live  rabbits,  his  efforts  to 
release  himself  from  his  struggling  captives  being  highly 
ludicrous.  When  out  with  the  otter-hounds  in  the  same 
year,  *'  we  came  "  (says  a  Free  Forester)  "  to  a  footpath  with 
deep  water  on  both  sides,  and  the  fiercest  and  strongest 
wasps'  nest  in  the  middle  of  the  path,  so  that  it  was  a  choice 
of  going  back  into  the  water  or  over  the  nest.  After  some 
consultation  it  was  decided  to  go  over  it,  or  rather  through  it : 
this  we  did,  and  no  less  than  sixteen  people  were  stung,  some 
seriously.      Hornby  for  two  hours  afterwards  was  wildly 


142  GOODRICH. 

pulling  off  coat,  waistcoat,  and  other  garments,  always  to 
find  a  wasp  under  his  shirt  stinging  him.  I  was  stung  in 
the  calf  of  the  leg,  which  caused  it  to  swell  as  big  as  my 
body,  and  the  weight  was  awful.  A  doctor  was  called  in, 
who  said  I  should  lose  my  leg  if  I  played  cricket  or  danced, 
and  that  I  should  have  to  nurse  it  for  some  months.  I  did 
dance,  at  first  under  great  pain  and  difficulty;  but  the  more 

1  danced  the  better  my  leg  got,  and  next  morning  I  was 
perfectly  well." 

At  Pype  Hayes,  where  they  began  their  Warwickshire 
&lt;:ampaign,  Free  Foresters  won  a  one-day  match  on  Aug. 
8  by  133  to  113.  J.  W.  Gardner  32,  Lord  Lewisham  20, 
•G.  Walker  32,  and  R.  Lant  20,  were  the  best  scores. 

On  the  loth,  at  Four  Oaks  Park,  the  home  side  only 
made  55  to  a  Forester  innings  of  222 — J,  Garnett  52,  L. 
•Garnett  and  T.  P.  Jervis  35  each.  Then  came  a  wet  day, 
which  caused  a  draw. 

The  next  match,  on  the  Sutton  Ground,  was  a  renewal  of 
the  old  local  contest,  which,  in  consideration  of  the  amount 
of  rising  talent  at  the  disposal  of  the  home  side,  was  arranged 
as  eighteen  of  Sutton,  J.  H.  Gibbon  acting  as  captain, 
against  a  Forester  twelve.  The  home  team  won  the  toss, 
and  despite  a  good  23  from  Gibbon,  supplemented  by  17 
from  Ward  and  13  from  Manley,  were  all  out  for  90  runs, 
'Goodrich  taking  9  wickets  (3  c  and  b)  and  likewise  making 

2  catches  off  Higgins,  who  took  6.  Foresters,  however, 
found  Gibbon's  bowling  not  very  easy,  and  went  down  for 
.80  runs — Louis  Garnett  21,  and  F.  Lee  20,  doing  best.  At 
time,  Sutton  had  made  10  runs  for  the  loss  of  2  wickets,  and 
the  second  day  being  again  wet  the  game  was  drawn. 

This  match  had  one  feature  of  peculiar  interest,  being 
the  last  time  that  the  veteran  Goodrich  played  with  his  old 
club,  and  not  improbably  was  his  final  appearance  in  a 
x:ricket  eleven. 

The  other  match  on   the   two  following   days   against 


LEICESTERSHIRE.  143 

Gentlemen  of  Stafifordshire  was  drawn  also  from  bad 
weather.  It  was  played  at  Little  Aston  Hall,  and  F.  F. 
made  160— F.  W.  Wright  32,  T.  Ratliff  (not  out)  28— to 
92,  R.  Moncriefif  21  and  C.  E.  Lyon  (not  out)  18  being 
best. 

At  Worcester,  Aug.  17  and  18,  the  County  beat  the 
Club,  making  102  and  150 — R.  Lyttelton  17  and  50,  A.  B. 
Martin  36  and  18,  F.  R.  Evans  19  and  22 — to  Foresters' 
94  and  128  ;  F.  W.  Wright  26  and  18,  T.  Ratliff  5  and  51 
(not  out).  While  at  Hanbury  (Mr  Foley  Vernon's),  on  the 
2 1st  and  22d,  Foresters  won  a  twelve-a-side  match  by  3 
wickets,  in  spite  of  a  fine  112  (not  out)  from  E.  Lyttelton. 
Hanbury  made  44  and  217,  Foresters  6j  and  199 — Louis 
Garnett  (not  out)  66. 

Deddington,  Aug.  19  and  20,  was  the  scene  of  a  draw  ; 
Fetherston  making  89  in  an  innings  of  209  for  the  home 
side,  and  Tubb,  Ramsay,  and  Marsham  disposing  of  Fores- 
ters for  141,  W.  F.  Higgins  48.  Deddington  then  lost  a 
wicket  for  17  runs. 

On  Aug.  25  and  26,  at  Rockingham  Park,  another 
twelve-a-side  contest  was  drawn,  F.  F.  making  189  and 
147  to  the  home  side's  166  and  135  for  5  wickets.  W.  F. 
Higgins  40  and  11,  H.  Verelst  o  and  43,  E.  Hume  31  and 
O,  F.  Crowder  14  and  (not  out)  26,  scored  for  F.  F. 

A  match  at  Leicester  v.  Gentlemen  of  the  county  was 
likewise  left  drawn  on  Aug.  28.

CHAPTER    XX. 

1875- 

The  season  commenced  with  a  match  at  Chiselhurst  on 
June  7,  when  West  Kent  beat  Free  Foresters  by  48  runs. 
It  was  a  twelve-a-side  game,  and  F.  F.  reahsed  lOi  and  58 
for  4  wickets — R.  Entwistle  25,  and  E.  Rutter  10  and  23, 
getting  most  runs.  Mr  F.  Penn  made  81  out  of  the 
Kentish  score  of  149. 

At  Winchester,  playing  the  Garrison  on  June  14, 
Foresters  won  by  40  runs,  making  164 — E.  C.  Hartopp 
34 — to  the  soldiers'  total  of  124.  H.  Tubb  disposed  of  4 
wickets,  S.  G.  Lyttelton  3,  E.  Rutter  2.  In  their  second 
innings  Foresters  scored  152  for  4  wickets,  J.  R.  Hutchison 
being  not  out  with  71  runs,  and  E.  Rutter,  who  had  made 
2J  runs  in  his  first  innings,  adding  another  30. 

They  proceeded  to  Hilsea,  where  on  June  16  and  17 
they  beat  the  Southern  Division  by  2  wickets,  scoring  103 
and  107  to  113  and  96.  F.  Baker  and  E.  Rutter  made  20 
each  in  the  first  innings  of  Foresters,  and  in  the  second  the 
latter  added  19,  H.  Tubb  28,  and  T.  S.  Pearson  25. 
Rutter  took  9  wickets,  Tubb  6,  Lyttelton  3. 

On  June  21  and  22,  the  match  with  Rugby  School  was 
drawn.     The  local  reporter  said  : — 

The  reason  of  the  absence  of  the  Rugby  School  match  from 
the  list  of  last  year's  fixtures  has  not  transpired,  and  it  would  do 

K 


146  RUGBY  SCHOOL. 

no  good  to  hazard  conjectures  about  it  now.  Suffice  it  to  say 
that  F.  F.'s  made  up  for  the  omission  by  sending  a  good  team  to 
Rugby  on  the  21st  and  22d  of  June  1875.  That  good  cricketer 
and  hard  hitter  H.  H.  Gillett,  who  at  Bullingdon  in  1859,  in 
Exeter  College  sports,  threw  116  yards  2  6  inches,  failed  to  come 
off  as  expected ;  but  for  F.  F.'s  Hay,  Williamson,  Evans,  Milne, 
Warner,  and  others  in  the  batting  line,  and  for  the  School  Cunliffe 
with  the  ball,  gave  a  good  account  of  themselves,  as  the  score 
will  show. 

Foresters  went  in  first  and  scored  93 — F.  R.  Evans  44, 
and  W.  H.  Hay  20,  doing  best.  The  School  then,  with 
a  good  innings  of  54  from  A.  S.  Bennet,  totalled  173,  and 
then  F.  F.  compiled  315.  R.  O.  Milne,  who  had  been 
not  out  8  in  the  first  innings,  contributed  117,  and  F. 
Williamson  45,  E.  H.  Warner  34,  W.  H.  Hay  32,  and  W. 
W.  Bagot  24.  The  last  named  took  3  Rugby  wickets,  and 
Gillett  and  Marriott  a  like  number.  D.  Buchanan  was 
not  playing  for  F.  F.  in  this  match. 

On  the  same  days  another  eleven  vanquished  Marl- 
borough by  five  wickets  (twelve  -  a  -  side),  the  College 
scoring  74  and  1 14  from  the  bowling  of  Voules,  Miles, 
Venables,  and  F.  Lee.  S.  G.  Lyttelton  and  F.  H.  Lee 
made  35  and  27  respectively  out  of  the  129  scored  by 
F.  F.  in  their  first  innings,  and  T.  Ratliff  was  not  out  19 
in  the  second. 

At  Shoebury,  on  June  25,  26,  a  match  was  left  drawn 
with  the  School  of  Gunnery,  who  scored  147  and  297 — 
Pattle  31  and  91  (not  out).  The  one  innings  of  Foresters 
totalled  191— J.  R.  Hutchison  42,  T.  Ratliff  41.  "I  like 
playing  at  Shoebury,"  said  a  certain  F.  F.  who  shall  be 
nameless  ;  "  start  at  one,  hot  lunch  at  two  !  " 

July  I  found  Foresters  at  Daylesford,  where  the  home 
team  made  127  and  82  for  5  wickets  and  won.  Foresters 
getting  out  for  73  and  135 — W.  Evetts  29,  the  only  score 
worth  mention.  S.  Butler  for  Daylesford  disposed  of  ten 
Foresters.     To  meet  Butler  in  those  days  was  no  joke, 


SAM  BUTLER, 


147 


though  Mr  Reid  appears  to  have  once  found  a  man  who 
thought  otherwise : — 

I  remember  one  year  S.  E.  Butler  was  playing  at  Shoeburyness, 
and  he  in  his  day,  and  if  he  chose,  could  put  in  a  tremendously 
fast  ball.  I  was  fielding  at  mid-on,  and  he  said  to  me — he  had 
just  got  a  wicket  by  the  way — "  Oh,  look  at  this  man  coming  in." 
He  was  the  most  splendid  specimen  of  the  genus  homo  I  think  I 
ever  saw ;  but  he  disdained  pads  and  gloves,  though  the  ground 
played  like  greased  lightning.  Sam  said,  "  May  I  give  him  a  fast 
one  ?  "  I  said  it  had  nothing  to  do  with  me,  but  if  he  hit  him  on 
the  leg  there  would  certainly  be  an  inquest,  and  I  advised — in 
fact  implored — him  not  to  bowl  too  fast  at  him.  He  said,  "  Oh, 
just  one^^^  and  before  I  could  say  anything  more  he  bowled  him 
the  "  just  oneP  I  can  hear  that  ball  hum  now  :  it  caught  the 
"  splendid  specimen "  full  pitch  on  his  shin,  and  to  "  Sam's " 
great  astonishment,  and  also  to  mine,  the  man  never  rubbed  the 
place,  or  even  limped,  but  calmly  proceeded  to  be  in  readiness 
for  the  next  ball !  After  the  end  of  the  innings  I  asked  the  man 
if  he  wasn't  hurt,  and  he  said  he  wasn't,  and  that  he  wouldn't 
have  minded  the  same  knock  every  ball  of  the  over.  And  I 
really  believe  that  he  meant  what  he  said.  What  his  legs  were 
composed  of  I  don't  know — ivory  probably  ! — C.  F.  R. 

On  July  5  they  met  at  Prince's  the  formidable  Upping- 
ham Rovers.

This    match    was    harmoniously    commemorated    in    the 
Uppingham  magazine  by  some  excellent  verses,  entitled 

"MR  JOHN   THOMAS   AT   PRINCE'S. 

"This  comes  'oping,  Mr  Hedditor,  it  may  find  U  in  good  'ealtli, 
Which,  without  it,  there's  no  benefit  in  wittles  nor  in  wealth. 
R  !  I'd  reether  be  a  pawper,  and  be  'earty,  'ale,  and  strong. 
Than  a  Creesus  with  the  toothake  or  the  'eadake  all  day  long  ; 
For  tho'  you  gets  no  wenson  in  the  workouse,  nor  no  wine, 
You  couldn't  with  the  toothake  enjoy  them  when  you  dine  ; 
And  tho'  the  Parrish  gives  no  ale  nor  porter,  why,  it's  clear 
A  Creesus  with  the  'eadake  E  can't  enjy  his  beer  ; 
Which  the  chicest  of  malt  lickers  ain't  of  no  good  when  you're  ill, 
'Cos  when  you'd  like  to  take  a  pint,  you  'ave  to  take  a  pill. 

But  talkink  of  good  'ealth,  my  I  !  U  should  'ave  gone  with  me 

The  valiant  gents  a-cricketing  at  Prince's  for  to  see  ! 

The  mussels  them  young  fellers  'ad,  you  wouldn't  scarce  believe, 

It  swelled  out  on  their  shoulders  like  a  fashinnable  sleeve. 

Their  harms  were  like  a  blacksmith's,  only  p'raps  a  trifle  whiter. 

And  their  bax  as  broad  as  Bendigo's,  the  celebrated  fiter  ; 

And  some  wore  'niggerbockers  to  ease  'em  as  they  played, 

And  the  calves  they   showed  compleetly  threw  us  footmen  in  the 

shade ; 
They  swelled  out  like  the  letter  P,  without  a  bounce  of  fat, 
For  their  legs  was  sollid  mussel,  which  ours  'aven't  much  of  that. 

It  was  on  Monday  afternoon,  a  quarter  after  four. 
And  the  carridge  was  a-waiting  for  our  ladies  at  the  door  ; 
Says  my  lady,  reether  languid,  '  Where  shall  we  drive  to-day  ? ' 
Says  Miss  Mary,  '  O  mammar,  we'll  go  to  see  the  Rovers  play  ; 
The  match  is  with  the  Foresters — the  best  in  all  the  year.' 
And  my  lady,  smilink  graciously,  says,  '  Very  well,  my  dear.' 


JOHN  THOMAS.  149 

So  hoff  we  went  to  Prince's  ground.     And  ho  !  'twere  like  a  phair, 

Only  neither  shows  nor  happle-stalls  nor  gingerbread  was  there  ; 

But  'eaps  of  gents  and  ladies  in  elligant  array, 

Which  some  'ad  come  to  flirt,  and  some  to  crittysize  the  Play. 

And  I  'eard  them  tell  how  'Utchingson  'ad  batted  strong  and  well, 

And  how  to  Patterson  and  Kidd  the  early  wickets  fell, 

And  how  the  wicket-keeper  'ad  fumbled  many  a  ketch, 

Which  the  Humpire  said  'twas  Rotten^  and  might  'ave  lost  the  Match; 

How  Fryer  E  playde  beautiful,  and  Lyttelton  and  Hay 

'Ad  given  the  bowlers  toko — I  suppose  that  means  Tokay, 

Or  some  bother  plessant  beveridge  the  thust  for  to  allay. 

The  ladies  wore  the  colors  of  the  side  they  'oped  would  beat, 
And  they  sat  beneath  the  spreading  trees  to  shade  'em  from  the  'eat, 
And  some  was  eating  hices,  and  some  strorberries  and  cream. 
And  some  they  was  a-drinking  tea,  and  a- watching  of  the  geame  ; 
And  some  was  skating  at  the  Rink  on  wheels  of  Injy-robber, 
Which  skating  in  the  summer-time  I  'ardly  think  is  propper. 
Miss  Mary  wore  the  ribbings  of  the  Rovers  in  her  'air. 
Which,  if  I  mite  persoom  to  say,  they  most  becoming  were. 
And  I  says  hunto  our  Coachman,  which  upon  the  bocks  I  sat, 
And  we'd  heach  a  Rover  favor  as  Miss  M.  made  for  our  'at — 
Says  I,  '  Some  Uppinam  Rover  'ave  been  saying  somethink  sweet.' 
Says  he,  '  It's  that  young  kovey  as  she  met  in  'Arley  Street.' 
And  being  reether  curious,  says  I,  *Why,  which  is  E?' 
Says  he,  '  Why,  don't  you  see  him  there,  a-handing  her  the  T  ? ' 
And  there  he  was  beside  her  chair,  partickler  in  attention, 
A  tall  and  'ansome  feller,  which  his  name  I  mustn't  mention. 

Has  thus  we  were  conversing,  there  went  up  such  a  cheer 

When  some  one  'it  a  6-er,  as  the  likes  you  seldom  'ear. 

And  ho  !  'twas  really  wonderful  to  see  the  fielders  run. 

As  hagile  as  young  grass'oppers,  all  in  the  burning  sun  ; 

Which  men  like  Mr  Beevor,  as  are  bulky  in  their  form. 

Must  find  it  most  puspiring  work,  leastways  when  it's  so  wann. 

The  holers,  as  I  'eard  'em  say,  was  dead  upon  the  spot. 

But  the  slow  ones  hevery  now  and  then  they  cawt  it  reether  'ot. 

And  R  !  to  see  that  Mr  Huff,  the  pace  he  slung  'em  in. 

Without  the  least  regard  to  'ead  or  'and  or  rib  or  shin  ; 

Which  not  being  made  of  hadamant,  nor  wishink  a  black  heye, 

Let  others  try  to  stand  afore  them  lightning  balls,  says  I. 

But  la  !  that  Mr  Crowder,  E  didn't  seem  to  care, 

And  the  galliant  Mr  Garnett  was  wisibly  '  all  there.' 

That  Garnett  is  a  cricket  gem,  as  sure  as  Pm  alive. 

And  he  'elped  to  make  the  tottle  two  'undred  ninety-5. 


I50  MISS  MARY'S   VERDICT. 

And  now  the  Upnam  Rovers  'ave  buckled  on  their  pads, 
And  Kid  and  Lucas  take  their  place,  a  pair  of  hactive  lads  ; 
And  though  they  tried  for  'alf  an  'our,  they  couldn't  get  'em  hout, 
But,  bold  as  any  Buffaloes,  they  stood  and  'it  about, 
And  when  at  last  the  play  was  stopd,  they  were  unconkered  still, 

'em  with  a  will. 


Next  day,  as  soon  as  lunch  were  done,  Miss  Mary  she  evinces 

A  most  uncommon  longing  for  to  be  again  at  Prince's  ; 

But  my  lady  'ad  some  shopping  first,  a  long  and  teejus  round, 

And  the  clox  was  striking  6  afore  we  came  upon  the  ground — 

When    hup  comes   that   young   feller,   and   'We've  'ad  bad  luck, 

says  E, 
'  And  are  follering  of  our  hinnings ' — (wotever  that  may  be  ! ) 
And  he  said  as  Mr  Pursy  Kidd  'ad  totted  sixty-6, 
And  Lucas  got  the  boling  in  a  very  pooty  fix  ; 

And  none  'ad  showed  in  better  style  than  Street,  the  County  player, 
And  turtle  'adn't  spiled  the  site  of  the  Wussipful  Lord  Mair,i 
Which  I  thinks  the  Mair,  if  he  was  there,  a  pore  sort  must  'ave  been, 
For  no  crimson  robes  nor  golden  chain  was  nowheres  to  be  seen. 


Now  J.  G.  B.  was  taking  T,  they  said,  with  Mr  Fryer, 

And  hall  this  time  the  tellygraff  was  mounting  hire  and  hire  ; 

And  ho  !  it  were  exciting  as  the  game  drew  near  a  close, 

And  the  way  my  'art  was  beating  at  that  momink.  Goodness  nose  ! 

But  at  last  it  hended  in  a  Draw,  which  was  a  great  relief. 

For  such  excitement's  'urtful,  leastways  in  my  belief. 


Hour  ladies  'aving  took  their  seats,  away  again  we  drove. 

And  we  brought  with  us  to  dinner  that  tall  and  'ansome  kove. 

And  ho  !  to  see  him  take  his  food  !  it  reely  were  a  site, 

For  cricket  is  a  game  as  much  improves  the  happytite. 

And  to  see  Miss  M.'s  heyes  sparkle  as  they  talked  the  matter  hover  ! 

It  made  me  wish  that  I  'ad  been  a  galliant  Uppinam  Rover. 

She  said  as  'ow  in  all  her  life  she  never  saw  such  play, 

And  the  Rovers  would  'ave  won  it — which  they  might  'ave,  I  dessay. 

And  when  they  plays  another  Match,  may  I  again  be  there, 

Which  I  am  your  'umble  servink, 

John  Thomas, 

Grosvenor  Square.'

On  the  20th  a  match  at  Deddington  was  stopped  by 
rain,  when  the  home  side  had  got  188,  Free  Foresters  84. 
H.  T.  Allsopp  28,  W.  Evetts  52,  and  C.  D.  Marsham  35, 
surpassed  the  F.  F.  score,  and  T.  E.  Cobb  and  E.  Ramsay

Upon  the  ground  !     Cricket's  the  game  for  me  ! "

On  the  27th  Free  Foresters  enjoyed  a  most  delightful 
reception  at  Fulbeck,  where  they  defeated  Col.  Fane's 
twelve  on  that  and  the  following  day  by  6  wickets.  C. 
B.  Tylecote  made  a  splendid  maiden  essay  with  F.  F., 
scoring  61  (not  out),  and  bowling  in  the  first  innings  26 
overs  for  27  runs  and  6  wickets. 

Malvern  College,  July  28  and  29,  only  made  203  in  both 
innings  to  254  in  Free  Foresters'  first — J.  H.  Gibbon  made 
75  and  E.  Stanhope  56.  And  on  the  two  next  days 
Foresters  drew  with  the  Malvern  Club,  who  made  182 
and  98  to  their  246. 

On  the  30th  also  a  match  at  Southwell  against  Mr 
Riddell's  team  was  drawn,  the  Newark  twelve  having  made 
132,  and  Free  Foresters  34  and  144  for  7  wickets.  This 
match  was  played  at  the  Southwell  ground,  in  consequence 
of  the  Newark  ground  being  flooded  by  the  Trent ! 

The  Scottish  tour  began  this  year  on  the  2d  August. 
Of  four  matches  played,  two  were  won,  one  lost,  and

10  to  Bray  for  81  and  loi  runs,  R.  Lyttelton  13  and  24

being  ledger-man  ;  so  that  Foresters,  who  made  in  their 
first  essay  161, — Crowder  41,  Appleby  and  Ratliff  20  each, 
— hit  off  the  balance  with  the  loss  of  2  wickets — Hay  9, 
and  F.  W.  Wright  15. 

At  Hanbury,  on  the  two  next  days,  Mr  Vernon's  eleven 
turned  the  tables,  making  142,  and  getting  Foresters  out 
for  62  and  yZ.  By  the  kindness  of  the  editor  of  the 
*  Worcester  Herald '  I  am  able  to  say  that  F.  F.  had  six 
ciphers  in  the  first  innings,  and  that  H.  AUsopp  and  T. 
Ratliff  both  obtained  spectacles ;  R.  Garnett,  26  and  10, 
showed  best  for  them.  The  Tylecote  brothers,  C.  B.  L. 
and  H.  E.,  took  11  F.  F.  wickets ;  and  C.  B.  L.  Tylecote 
25,  Alfred  Lyttelton  30,  and  E.  Allsopp  43,  assisted  the 
Hanbury  score. 

The  programme  at  Sutton  Coldfield  commenced  on 
Aug.  9  with  a  very  interesting  contest  against  eleven 
Garnetts,  won  by  7  runs.

At  Shoeburyness  the  next  day,  however,  the  boot  was 
on  the  other  leg,  for  F.  F.,  who  made  254,  won  in  an  inn- 
ings by  6d&gt;  runs. 

At  Prince's,  on  July  3  and  4,  another  fine  run-getting 
game  with  Uppingham  Rovers  was  left  undecided.

On  July  8,  at  Haileybury,  Free  Foresters  having  made 
213,  got  out  the  boys  for  62,  and  the  follow  produced 
47  runs  for  4  wickets.  S.  B.  Chamberlayne  49,  R.  G. 
Venables  55,  E.  P.  Ash  25,  H.  N.  Tennent  24,  were  the 
principal  scorers  for  F.  F. 

On  July  17  a  very  successful  tour  in  Kent  was  inaugur- 
ated by  a  match  at  Warnham  Court,  where  F.  F.  won  by

UPS  AND  DOWNS.  159 

fore  with  79,  R.  Garnett  54,  S.  G.  Lyttelton  45,  but  E. 
Hume  took  premier  place  with  81. 

And  the  next  day,  July  21,  Free  Foresters  scoring  100  and 
^S^  were  beaten  at  Preston  Hall  by  2  wickets.  R.  Garnett 
made  17  and  15,  the  best  scores  for  F.  F.,  J.  Dale  16  and 
30  for  Mr  Brassey's  side.  Gilliat  took  1 1  of  the  Hall  wick- 
ets, Francis  and  Fellowes  (Capt.  J.)  disposed  of  Foresters. 

Gentlemen  of  Bedfordshire  beat  Free  Foresters  at  Turvey 
House,  July  24  and  25,  the  Club  collapsing  in  the  second 
innings  for  6^,,  after  having  claimed  187  with  a  man  short 
in  the  first.  S.  G.  Lyttelton  with  54  and  3,  H.  W.  Verelst 
with  32  and  8,  R.  Garnett  with  3  and  30  (not  out),  and  J. 
Marsham  with  37  and  14,  were  their  best  scorers.  The 
County  Gentlemen  made  125 — T.  S.  Pearson  30  and  F. 
Safiford  the  same  number — and  then  wiped  off  the  runs  for 
4  wickets  ;  H.  G.  Tylecote  41,  and  W.  Vyse  37,  being  not 
out. 

After  a  tolerably  close  first  innings  against  Malvern 
College,  Free  Foresters  beat  them  on  July  26  by  213 
runs,  scoring  154  and  263  to  the  M.  C.  C.  C.  139  and  65.

On  the  28th  and  29th  a  match  with  Newark  was  drawn, 
Mr  Riddell's  twelve  scoring  179  and  90  for  8  wickets,  while 
F.  F.  made  220  in  their  one  innings,  of  which  E.  F.  S.  Tyle- 
cote made  106,  H.  W.  Verelst  36,  F.  E.  Allsopp  32.  For 
Newark  J.  G.  Beevor  61  and  o,  A.  P.  Lucas  25  and  32, 
E.  M.  H.  Riddell  21  and  26,  H.  F.  Clinton  40  and  3,  did 
best.  The  brothers  Tylecote,  E.  and  C,  were  instrumental 
in  securing  12  wickets. 

On  the  31st  Free  Foresters  began  a  four  days'  engage- 
ment at  the  splendid  and  hospitable  mansion  of  Sir  Charles

Gentlemen  of  Warwickshire,  whom  they  defeated  by  5 
wickets.

The  two  following  days  were  devoted  to  a  match  with 
I  Zingari,  of  which  the  reporter  said  : — 

Two  strong  teams.  Foresters  won  the  toss,  and  made  good 
use  of  their  advantage,  all  scoring  with  the  exception  of  their 
veteran  bowler,  whose  mind  being,  unfortunately,  more  active 
than  his  body,  was  badly  run  out  just  as  he  was  beginning  to 
look  dangerous.  For  I  Zingari,  Lyttelton,  Rowley,  Marriott, 
and  Lord  Willoughby  came  to  the  front,  Lyttelton's  square-leg 
hitting  into  the  band-tent  becoming  almost  monotonous  (at  a 
later  period  in  the  day  the  "  big  drum  "  was  reported  far  from 
well ;    a   cure  was    speedily  provided  by   Captain   Middleton).

Kenyon  Slaney  (not  out)  i ;  extras  2, — total  45. 

Appleby  was  struck  by  Capt.  (Bay)  Middleton,  when 
batting,  on  the  right  elbow ;  he  had  to  leave  off,  and  was 
unable  to  bat  in  the  second  innings,  but  bowling  left- 
handed,  he  was  not  disabled  in  that  capacity. 

On  the  same  days,  Aug.  i  and  2,  another  team  of  Fores- 
ters made  a  draw  of  a  match  at  Alton  Towers,  which  looked 

L 


i62  INTERNECINE  STRIFE. 

like  a  victory,  had  the  clerk  of  the  weather  been  more  pro- 
pitious. For  F.  R,  who  scored  158  and  j6,  C.  B.  L.  Tyle- 
cote  28  and  27,  R.  Garnett  45  and  i,  W.  J.  Lyon  23  and 
2"],  H.  G.  Tylecote  6  and  40,  and  F.  Baker  23  (not  out) 
and  13,  were  prominent;  and  the  Tylecote  family  took 
the  whole  of  the  wickets.  For  Alton  nobody  exceeded  20 
but  W.  Moore,  21  (not  out).  Their  score  was  93  and  31 
for  3  wickets. 

On  the  4th  and  5th,  at  Hanbury,  a  side  which  was  ipsis 
Hibernis  Hibernior,  more  Forester  than  many  a  Forester 
eleven,  drew  a  rather  interesting  contest.  For  F.  F.,  who 
scored  197  and  198,  in  the  first  innings  seven  double  figures 
were  made,  25  (not  out)  from  T.  RatlifT,  the  highest.  In 
the  second  innings,  G.  H.  Longman  65,  and  T.  RatlifT  39 
(not  out),  made  more  than  half  the  runs.  For  Hanbury, 
again,  there  were  seven  double  figures  in  the  first  innings, 
H.  G.  and  C.  B.  Tylecote,  40  and  32,  being  chief  In  the 
second  innings  an  excellent  45  from  A.  Lyttelton  and  a 
steady  29  from  W.  F.  Higgins  made,  with  extras,  a  score 
of  102  for  I  wicket. 

The  Scottish  matches  this  year  (the  last  in  which  they 
were  attempted)  dwindled  to  two  only  :  one  was  lost  and 
the  other  won. 

On  the  same  days  as  the  last  of  these,  Aug.  9  and  10, 
a  renewal  of  the  match  with  Gentlemen  of  Worcestershire, 
after  a  very  even  first  innings,  ended  in  favour  of  Free 
Foresters  by  231  runs,  several  of  the  opposing  team  having 
taken  their  departure.  H.  C.  Maul,  71  and  59,  was  un- 
doubtedly the  F.  F.  champion,  and  was  ably  seconded  by 
H.  W.  Verelst  23  and  69,  the  other  figures  of  note  being 
H.  M.  Marshall  14  and  36,  G.  H.  Longman  36  and  7,  J. 
Garnett  o  and  28.  For  the  County,  F.  H.  Lee  54  and  J. 
R.  Walker  35  are  noteworthy.  Stewart  Garnett  accounted 
for  10  Worcester  wickets.  Bray  for  8. 

The  next  match,  Aug.    11    and    12,  played  at    Sutton

THE  FAMILY  UNDEFEATED.  163 

Coldfield  against  eleven  Garnetts,  though  unfinished,  ex- 
hibited some  very  pretty  cricket,  and  if  time  had  permitted 
might  have  had  an  interesting  finale.

The  match  which  followed,  against  twelve  gentlemen  of 
Staffordshire  at  Lichfield,  had  likewise  some  interesting 
features,  especially  when  F.  R,  going  in  the  second  time 
to  get  100  runs  to  win,  saw  Longman  and  Tillard  fall  for 
a  cipher,  and  Ratliff  follow  suit  in  another  over,  while 
their  score  was  as  blank  (to  quote  from  'Pickwick')  as  their 
faces.  Fortunately  good  play  was  in  reserve :  Allsopp 
and  Baker  made  21  each,  the  latter  not  out,  and  Wil- 
liamson carried  his  bat  for  18,  so  they  won  by  4  wickets.

made  45  in  the  first  innings  of  Foresters,  and  Ratliff  27, 
besides  accounting  for  9  wickets ;  Allsopp  and  Tillard 
took  5  apiece,  Lyon  for  Staffordshire  10. 

Shropshire,  on  the  17th  and  i8th,  were  beaten  by  9 
wickets,  Wingfield's  31  being  the  only  individual  contri- 
bution of  note,  in  their  96  and  y^.  F.  F.,  by  the  aid  of 
58  from  S.  G.  Lyttelton  and  30  from  E.  F.  S.  Stanhope, 
made  154  in  their  first  innings. 

At  Market  Harboro'  on  the  21st  F.  F.  encountered  Mr 
Hay's  team  with  a  deficiency  of  force  ill  supplied  by  kind 
emergencies.  S.  Bucknill  34  (not  out)  and  4,  T.  Ratliff 
15  and  28,  F.  Baker  24  and  2,  H.  Verelst  13  and  16,  were 
the  chief  contributors  to  their  rather  meagre  totals  of  129 
and  114.  On  the  other  side,  John  Marsham,  44,  helped  a 
first  innings  of  116,  and  the  requisite  128  was  made  with 
the  loss  of  7  wickets,  W.  Hay  37  (not  out),  and  Capt. 
Meares  33. 

The  last  match  of  this  successful  season  was  played  on 
Aug.  24  and  25  at  Deddington,  the  home  side  getting  34 
and  128,  while  F.  F.,  who  made  156,  won  without  losing  a 
wicket.     Twelve  a-side  played. 


CHAPTER   XXII, 


THE    SCOTTISH     TOURS. 


1864-65. 


When  it  first  occurred  to  the  present  writer  to  try  the 
experiment  of  the  circuit  in  the  Land  of  Cakes,  the  off- 
spring of  his  brain  very  nearly  perished  in  infancy  for  want 
of  encouragement.  Selecting  the  idlest  fellow  and  best 
batsman  of  his  acquaintance,  he  tentatively  put  the 
question,  "  What  should  you  say  to  an  autumn  cricket-tour 
in  Scotland  ? "  A  pale  cast  of  thought  sicklied  for  an 
instant  the  wholesome  ruddiness  of  the  hero's  countenance, 
"  Is  Scotland  an  island  ? "  quoth  he.  When  assured  that 
you  could  reach  that  portion  of  Britain  without  a  marine 
trip,   he   condescended    to   say   he  would   "think    of  it"; 


i66  SOFT  DA  YS. 

"  but,"  he  added,  "  I  went  to  Ireland  with  I  Zingari  once, 
and  no  more  islands  for  me,  thankye."  His  thought  of  it, 
as  might  be  expected,  ended  in  a  polite  excuse  for  not 
going,  and  somewhat  similar  replies  were  received  from  at 
least  four-and-twenty  other  intimate  friends  of  the  pro- 
jector. E.  K.  Hornby,  however,  was  staunch,  and  with 
Hood,  Bass,  and  W.  J.  Lyon,  we  started,  relying  on  a 
promise  that  other  Foresters,  who  were  temporary  residents 
beyond  the  Border,  would  turn  up  to  our  aid.  At  Glasgow, 
where  we  began  on  Sept.  6,  1864,  we  literally  had  only 
seven  men ;  but  as  the  first  day  was  too  wet  to  play,  and 
on  the  second  the  West  of  Scotland,  winning  the  toss, 
went  in  and  made  178,  H.  Tennent  63  being  ledger-man, 
only  one  F.  F.  wicket  fell  for  35. 

We  journeyed  next  to  Perth,  where  we  went  in  first  and 
ten  batsmen  made  227 — Lyon  43,  Hornby  41,  Tennent  39, 
Bass  34,  Hood  23,  R.  J.  Garnett  16.  The  Perth  men  then 
made  177,  and  got  8  F.  F.  wickets  down  for  167 — Lyon 
32  (not  out)  ;  he  also  bowled  six  wickets. 

On  the  14th  at  Stirling  it  rained  all  day;  and  on  the  15th 
and  1 6th  bad  weather  and  bad  cricket  prevailed  at  Kelso, 
who  made  184,  their  two  professionals  accounting  for  69 
runs,  and  extras  20 ;  while  four  Foresters  went  out  for  26. 
This  was  not  encouraging.  However,  the  following  year,  as 
I  was  a  temporary  resident  near  Edinburgh,  I  was  able  to 
arrange  a  good  programme,  and  Osbert  Mordaunt  brought 
a  strong  eleven,  including  Goodrich,  Mott,  Hood,  Lionel 
Garnett,  Bass,  and  Colley — the  last  named,  though  he  ac- 
companied us,  being  unable  to  play  from  the  result  of  an 
accident :  we  had  no  difficulty,  however,  in  filling  his  place. 
We  began  with  the  Grange  Club,  Edinburgh,  on  Aug.  i, 
who  beat  us  rather  unexpectedly,  as  they  did  not  make 
many  runs,  and  our  batting  was  strong.  They  scored  98 
in  their  first  innings,  and  F.  F.  119 — Hood  31,  Mott  27, 
&amp;c.     The  Grange  only  reached  1 14  in  their  second  hands,

THE  SOUTH  INCH.  167 

though  Jack  Mackenzie  made  a  good  48  ;  but  with  94  to  win 
we  only  made  57.  On  the  3d,  in  a  one  day's  contest  with 
Dalkeith,  we  showed  up  better.  The  home  eleven  made 
1 36,  their  full  worth  ;  and  then  Foresters,  with  the  two  last 
wickets,  Goodrich  and  C.  Bedford,  still  in,  made  250 — 
Mott's  63  being  a  fine  hitting  innings  (one  hit  for  eight  in 
particular),  well  supported  by  Hood  with  50,  Mordaunt  36, 
Lyon  25,  Downe  17. 

On  the  4th  and  5  th,  at  Glasgow,  the  West  of  Scotland 
succumbed  (13  to  Goodrich)  for  the  small  scores  of  47  and 
79;  while  F.  F.,  with  nine  double  figures,  gave  a  total  of 
210  in  one  innings — Hood  56,  Lyon  32,  Garnett  23,  &amp;c. 

At  Stirling,  thanks  to  the  toss,  F.  F.  went  in  first  and 
scored  215,  of  which  Garnett  was  credited  with  61,  Mor- 
daunt 48,  Lyon  35,  Mott  and  James  Smith  Barry  20  each. 
Stirling  only  scored  70  and  99,  their  pro.,  Guild,  making 
22  and  39  of  them. 

On  the  second  day  at  Perth,  the  weather,  which  had 
changed  for  the  worse  the  day  before,  stopped  the  match 
outright,  F.  F.  having  scored  136 — Mott  43,  Mordaunt  31, 
&amp;c. — and  Perth,  whose  last  man  saved  the  follow-on,  64. 
The  Foresters'  second  innings  in  the  dark  and  on  a  bad 
wicket  only  produced  65  for  eight  wickets,  so  there  might 
be  some  speculation  on  the  result.  I  forget  whether  it 
was  in  this  match  or  the  year  before  that  I  was  scoring, 
with  the  Hon.  Sec.  of  Perth  for  my  companion,  when  a 
long  stand  was  made  on  our  side,  and  my  colleague  sent  to 
speak  to  his  brother,  the  captain  in  the  field.  "  You  must 
take  Lochead  [pro.]  off,"  said  he.  "  Well,  he  says  that  if 
he  don't  get  a  wicket  presently,  he'll  try  an  over  of  lobs  ! " 

Perth  certainly  was  an  old-world  place  to  play  cricket  in, 
— an  uninclosed  ground,  and  a  large  contingent  of  unwashed 
urchins  of  tender  years  by  way  of  gallery  :  they  hissed,  as 
Lyon  reminds  me,  when  we  made  a  good  hit  or  catch  ; 
but  the  batsman,  after  a  long  innings,  was  conducted  to 


i68  POLICE! 

the  tent  in  triumph,  one  of  the  small  boys  marching  in 
front  with  the  bat. 

There  were  other  perils  at  Perth  besides  those  of  the 
Inch.  We  very  nearly  left  a  couple  of  our  eleven  in 
durance  vile  there.  All  through  the  tour  one  or  two 
obstreperous  demonstrations  had  checkered  the  usual 
tranquillity  of  Forester  cricket,  and  we  had  tried  to  give  a 
hint  to  the  principal  offender  by  serving  him  in  the  field 
with  a  bogus  summons  for  some  act  of  mischief,  through 
the  connivance  of  a  friendly  "local  authority."  But  at 
Perth  he  and  another  cricketer  were  actually  run  in  for 
insisting  on  calling  up  a  billiard-marker  at  12.30  A.M. 
Luckily  a  masonic  superintendent  of  police  recognised  a 
brother,  and  did  not  insist  upon  bail.  The  next  morning 
the  patriarch  of  the  party  thought  it  incumbent  upon  him 
to  lecture  the  other  roysterer,  when  to  his  great  surprise  he 
found  that  he  was  far  too  highly  impressed  with  a  burning 
sense  of  his  own  wrongs,  especially  of  the  injury  he  had 
been  subjected  to  by  the  policeman.  "  Was  it  his  duty," 
he  exclaimed,  "  to  call  me "  We  may  leave  the  appel- 
lative choked,  as  it  was  by  his  indignation,  for  it  w^as  that 
familiar  to  the  British  private  beloved  of  Mr  Rudyard 
Kipling,  and  equally  so  to  the  Scottish  rough  of  that 
period.  Fortunately  words  break  no  bones,  or  the  finale 
might  have  stood  "  Retired  hurt !  " 

But  it  certainly  was  annoying  when  an  infuriated  bag- 
man brought  a  policeman  into  the  hotel  at  Glasgow,  to 
give  into  custody  somebody  who  had  filled  his  Wellington 
boots  with  water.  Of  course  he  pitched  upon  the  wrong 
men,  and  their  calm  demeanour  and  evident  innocence  so 
wrought  upon  the  guardian  of  the  peace  that  he  recom- 
mended his  client  to  apologise,  lest  the  gentlemen  should 
retort  upon  him. 

A  more  strictly  cricket  incident  occurred  at  Stirling  : 
after  our  innings  the  county  men  dallied    a   good    deal

before  going  to  the  wicket,  and  some  one  asked  for  the 
ball.  "  We've  sent  up  for  it  to  the  town,"  was  the  reply. 
"  But  why  not  go  on  using  the  one  we  have  ? "  "  We  want 
to  sting  your  hands  a  bit  with  a  new  yin/'  was  the  ex- 
planation.

1866. 


By  D.  Buchanan. 

It  was  with  pleasant  anticipations  that  in  the  summer  of 
the  above  year  I  accepted  Osbert  Mordaunt's  invitation  to 
make  one  of  his  eleven  in  the  cricketing  tour  to  Scot- 
land which  he  had  arranged  ;  and  I  looked  forward  to 
this  visit  to  the  north  with  the  more  pleasure,  not  only 
because  I  should  renew  my  acquaintance  with  the  Grange 
Club,  of  which  I  was  a  member  thirteen  years  before, 
but  also  because  I  hoped  to  revisit  scenes  of  early  days, 
and  note  the  many  changes  which  had  taken  place  since 
the  iron  horse  went  snorting  through  the  land.  Fortunate 
it  is  that  in  bonny  Scotland  there  are  spots  far  from  the 
beaten  track  where  nature,  in  rugged  beauty,  revels  in 
wealth  of  heath,  and  stream,  and  birken  glen  —  tracts 
which  man  in  his  ruthless  thirst  for  gold  will  ne'er  de- 
face, because  it  will  not  pay ;  whose  solitudes  are  still 
the  haunt  of  the  red-deer ;  from  whose  heath-clad  hills 
"  The  gor-cock  crousely  craws  the  mom  ; " 


1 70  AN  ANTICIPA  TION. 

and    o'er  whose    loftiest    heights,   wheeling    in    majestic 

flight But  I  spare  you,  gentle  reader,  and  will  only 

add  the  earnest  hope  that  as  long  as  the  world  shall 
last  there  may  be  found  in  "  Caledonia  stern  and  wild " 
spots  such  as  these,  affording  fitting  themes  for  painter 
and  poet  alike,  for  where  the  iron  streak  runs  all  things 
are  levelled  down.  I  have  seen  the  lordly  stag  with 
his  companions  —  the  "children  of  the  mist"  —  in  the 
brakes  of  Auchnashellach,  quietly  browsing  within  rifle- 
shot of  the  Strome  Ferry  train,  and  have  knocked  over 
the  karken  freuche  (Gaelic,  heather -hen  or  red -grouse) 
some  twenty  yards  or  so  from  the  Highland  Railway  at 
Dalwhinnie  ;  and  who  can  tell  but  that  some  day  on  some 
distant  mountain  -  top  we  may  find  a  scene  somev/hat 
similar  to  that  depicted  at  the  head  of  this  chapter,  and 
be  saluted  with.  Walk  up,  ladies  and  gentlemen ;  only 
a  penny.  Walk  up,  walk  up  and  see  the  Fat  Lady, 
and  the  Golden  Eagle  a-sittin'  on  its  nest ! ! !  Notwith- 
standing these  animadversions,  railways  are  indispensable 
in  the  present  age,^  and  by  their  means  the  Free  For- 
esters were  comfortably   and   rapidly  conveyed  to  Edin- 


^  To  illustrate  the  curious  notions  old  people  in  Scotland  held  on  matters 
connected  with  railways.  An  old  lady  whom  I  knew  in  Roxburghshire,  who 
had  never  been  in  a  train  in  her  life,  and  whose  ideas  on  modern  discoveries 
were  very  primitive,  inquired  in  all  soberness,  and  in  much  the  same  words  as 
follows  :  "  If  I  were  in  one  train  and  saw  a  freen  [friend]  passin'  in  anither, 
could  I  no'  stop  and  hae  a  crack  [talk]  wi'  her?"  Almost  a  parallel  case  to 
that  of  the  old  Scotchwoman  who,  finding  she  was  being  carried  beyond  her 
destination,  called  out,  "  Gerd  !  gerd  !  let  me  oot,  let  me  oot !  ! "  While  the 
ink  with  which  this  note  was  written  thus  far  was  wet,  a  friend  who  had  driven 
up  to  the  front  told  me  the  following  story.  His  grandfather,  in  going  from 
Berwickshire  to  visit  his  relatives  in  Northumberland,  was  in  the  habit  of  driv- 
ing across  the  old  bridge  which  connects  Berwick  with  Tweedmouth.  On  a 
similar  journey  with  his  wife,  towards  the  end  of  the  "Forties,"  when  about 
to  start  from  Berwick  by  train,  seeing  the  lofty  new  bridge,  with  its  many 
arches,  across  the  Tweed,  he  said  to  his  wife,  "  I've  often  gane  ower  the  auld 
brig  ;  but  am  no  gaun  to  risk  my  neck  fleein'  through  the  air  here,  sae  I'll 
just  walk  across  by  the  auld  brig,  and  jine  ye  on  the  ither  side  o'  the  watter." 


AN  ACCIDENT.

burgh,  for  their  first   match  with  the   Grange   Club — the 
Marylebone  of  the  North. 

The  match  was  played  on  the  Academy  Ground,  Raeburn 
Place.  The  Grange  Club,  owing  to  expiration  of  lease, 
and  the  property  being  taken  for  building  purposes,  had 
lost  their  old  ground  on  the  west  side  of  the  Lothian  Road, 
and  had  not  then  obtained  a  new  site.  The  Foresters 
were  fortunate  enough  to  win  by  36  runs,  and  had  not  Hill 
been  put  hors  de  combat  the  result  might  have  been  differ- 
ent. I  have  seen  many  batsmen  badly  hit,  and  once  in 
practice  on  the  old  Grange  ground  Jackson,  afterwards  the 
fast  Nottingham  bowler,  then  engaged  by  the  Club,  and  a 
wild  tearing  bowler,  hit  me  on  the  face  with  a  bumping 
ball ;  but  I  have  never  seen  any  one  struck  harder  than 
young  Hill  was.  Macgill — over  six  feet  high,  and  a  hard 
hitter — and  he  were  batting  well,  and  beginning  to  make 
runs  fast,  when  the  former  drove  a  ball  straight  back,  hard 
and  low.  Hill,  who  was  backing  up  well,  could  not  get  out 
of  the  way,  and  was  hit  full  below  the  belt  a  terrific  blow, 
which  finished  the  innings  and  the  match.  I  never  met 
Hill  again,  and  never  could  ascertain  if  any  permanent  in- 
jury was  done.     The  following  was  the  score  : —

The  next  match  was  played,  Thursday  and  Friday,  the 
2d  and  3d  August,  on  the  picturesque  ground  in  front  of 
Dalkeith  Palace,  one  of  the  seats  of  the  Duke  of  Buccleuch, 
and  was  won  by  Foresters  in  one  innings  with  6y  runs  to 
spare.  There  being  no  special  feature  in  the  match  in  a

On  the  morning  of  Saturday  the  4th  of  August  the 
Free  Foresters  proceeded  to  Stirling.  The  wicket  was 
rather  of  a  spongy  nature,  and  the  out-fielding  not  good. 
The  match  was  won  by  Foresters  in  one  innings  with  16 
runs  to  spare.     Score —

On  Monday  the  6th  of  August,  by  an  early  train,  with 
Jupiter  Pluvius  in  the  ascendant,  Foresters  made  their  way 
to  Glasgow,  and  on  to  Drumpellier,  where  they  were 
heartily  welcomed  by  Colonel  and  Mrs  Buchanan  of 
"  that  ilk."  The  kind  reception  and  gracious  hospitality 
enjoyed  by  the  Foresters,  not  only  on  this  occasion  but 
in  subsequent  years,  whenever  the  Scottish  tour  took 
place,  will  always  be  remembered  with  the  greatest 
pleasure  by  all  the  F.  F.'s  who  played  in  those  matches. 
And  particularly  by  me  is  this  first  match  at  Drumpellier 


174  A   RETROSPECT. 

to  be  remembered,  since  it  was  the  precursor  of  delightful 
visits  at  Drumpellier,  and  many  more  for  many  years 
to  Colonel  Buchanan's  charming  place,  Carradale,  in 
Argyllshire,  where — on  the  "  beautiful  hills  of  Kintyre," 
with  good  sportsmen,  good  dogs,  and  with  all  arrange- 
ments carried  out  in  true  sportsmanlike  manner  ;  or  on 
the  cricket  -  ground,  in  friendly  riyalry  with  the  Camp- 
beltown Club  ;  or,  if  hills  were  shrouded  in  mist  and  rain 
came  down,  by  the  river-side,  beginning  at  my  favourite 
pool  at  Auchenruaich,  some  four  miles  up  the  glen,  and 
fishing  down ;  with  evenings  graced  by  the  presence  of 
a  kind  and  thoughtful  hostess,  and  a  lady  friend  or  two — 
time,  alas  !  too  swiftly  sped  away.  Owing  to  rain  no  play 
took  place  on  the  first  day  of  the  match,  but  on  the  second, 
one  innings  each  was  concluded.  Watson,  afterwards  the 
noted  slow  bowler  for  Lancashire,  then  employed  in  some 
iron-works  in  Coatbridge, — a  capital  wicket-keeper,  good 
fast  bowler,  and  useful  batsman,  —  played  regularly  for 
Drumpellier.     Score : —

No  Scottish  tour  having  taken  place  in  1867,  the  getting 
up  a  team  and  the  arrangement  of  the  fixtures  was  under- 
taken by  me  in  the  exceptionally  dry  season  of  1868,  and  for 
several  years  afterwards.  The  match  with  Perth  in  1868 
is  specially  worthy  of  mention,  because  it  was  the  only  one 
ever  played  by  the  Free  Foresters  at  that  ''  fair  city  "  which 
was  brought  to  a  definite  conclusion, — the  matches  of  1864 
and  1865  having  been  prematurely  closed  by  rain, — and 
the  one  of  the  tour  which  they  least  cared  to  lose.  It  was 
remarkable  to  see  the  interest  taken  by  the  "  caddies  "  and 


176  ''FIRST  PRINCIPLES^ 

barefooted  lads  in  the  streets.  They  staked  their  pennies 
and  twopences  on  the  result,  and  on  taking  a  walk  after 
our  evening  meal  at  the  George,  I  overheard  one  of  them 
remark  to  his  companions,  "That's  yin  o'  the  Free  For- 
esters." It  was  a  good  match,  and  well  won  by  F.  F.'s. 
Many  Scotch  clubs  were  anxious  to  make  matches  with  the 
Foresters,  but  as  all  the  matches  were  to  be  played  within 
the  limits  of  a  fortnight,  only  those  which  were  considered 
convenient  were  selected .  Amongst  these  was  Kelso,  which 
was  thought  a  good  place  to  begin  the  tour  with,  especially 
as  the  match  there  gave  Foresters  an  opportunity  of  seeing 
the  far-famed  Tweed,  and  on  their  way  to  Edinburgh  they 
had  a  glimpse  of  the  Eildon  Hills  and  Melrose  Abbey.  The 
country  there  was  well  known  to  me,  and  I  had  formerly 
been  a  member  of  the  Club,  A  good  story,  not  generally 
known,  in  connection  with  the  visit  to  Kelso  of  the  All 
England  Eleven, — Old  Clarke's  eleven, — as  far  as  I  can 
recollect,  in  the  year  1852,  may  be  mentioned.  The  match 
was  played  on  the  ground — kindly  lent  to  the  Club  by 
the  Duke  of  Roxburgh e — on  Kelso  Race-course.  An  old 
grocer,  who  had  been  looking  on  at  the  match  for  some 
time,  on  an  interval  taking  place,  accosted  "Old  Clarke"  in 
the  following  terms  :  "  It's  a  verra  fine  game  this  cricketts, 
Mr  Clerk  !  I've  a  gude  mind  to  tak'  to  it  mysel'.  Noo,  Mr 
Clerk,  wad  ye  jist  instruct  me  in  the  first  preenciples  o' 
crickett } "  Old  Clarke  looked  the  old  grocer  over,  and 
seeing  that  his  finger-nails  were  long,  had  been  in  constant 
contact  with  sugar,  snuff,  pepper,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c.,  and  were  innocent 
of  a  nail-brush,  said  dryly,  "  The  first  preenciples  of  cricket 
are,  to  coot  yer  nayls."  My  experiences  of  the  Scotch 
tours  were  very  agreeable  ones,  and  when  the  fortnight  was 
up  and  the  matches  over,  the  team  generally  broke  up  with 
unanimous  expressions  of  regret  that  their  pleasant  trip 
had  come  to  an  end. 


A   SAD  NOTE.  177 


1868. 

The  season  of  1868,  as  Mr  Buchanan  has  incidentally 
mentioned,  was  unusually  hot  and  dry,  hence  the  diary 
of  the  Forester  progress  that  year  commences  with  a 
misquotation  from  Walter  Scott — 

"  Land  of  brown  turf  and  scanty  flood  " — 

"  descriptive  of  an  August  when  there  was  not  a  particle 
of  verdure  upon  the  hillside  nor  a  bucketful  of  water 
in  the  burn  which  gems  the  glen.  However,  before  F.  F. 
bent  their  backward  steps  towards  the  Border,  refresh- 
ing showers  had  begun  to  gladden  the  country  -  side, 
putting  a  veto  upon  that  implicit  reliance  on  the  clerk 
of  the  weather  which  is  the  sheet  -  anchor  of  cricket 
engagements." 

They  began  at  Edinburgh  on  July  30  against  the 
Grange,  and  with  9  wickets  only,  eight  F.  F.  and  a  couple 
of  substitutes,  compiled  81,  Verelst  making  26  and  Pender 
21.  The  Grange,  going  in  to  the  bowling  of  Buchanan 
and  Bass,  completed  a  total  of  138,  including  40  from 
Sanderson  and  22  from  Jack  Mackenzie.  F.  F.,  who  had 
lost  the  services  of  Pender  in  their  second  innings,  scored 
206 — Verelst  6^,  Bennet  61 — and  drew  the  match  ;  the 
Grange,  with  5  wickets  down,  having  made  112  at  the 
call  of  time,  Mackenzie  again  contributing  46  runs.  Two 
days  afterwards  he  injured  his  spine  when  taking  a 
header  while  bathing,  and,  after  lingering  a  few  days, 
expired  at  the  age  of  thirty ;  and  Scotland  had  to  mourn 
the  loss  of  one  of  the  finest  proficients  in  all  manly  games 
that  ever  entered  a  field,  a  man  equally  admirable  in 
every  other  relation  of  life. 

On  the  1st  of  August  Stirling  County  only  made  42 
and  48,  to  97  scored  by  Foresters — Bennet  33,  Verelst  14, 

M 


178  A    TRIUMPHAL  MARCH. 

and  D.  M'Donald  (not  out)  14,  taking  the  palm.  Buch- 
anan accounted  for  11   Scottish  wickets. 

On  the  3d  and  4th,  Foresters  did  badly  at  Dalkeith, 
who  with  the  assistance  of  32  from  Watson  (professional) 
totalled  142.  Foresters  only  scored  34  and  106,  and  were 
thus  beaten  in  one  innings.  D.  McDonald  18  and  20,  H. 
Verelst  2  and  33,  H.  Bass  o  and  27,  made  a  creditable  fight. 

Aug.  5  and  6  were  spent  at  Drumpellier,  where  F.  F. 
won  by  5  wickets.  This  was  the  match  of  which  the 
chronicler  said  that  the  most  remarkable  feature  was  the 
temporary  deposition  of  David  (not,  as  might  be  sup- 
posed, by  Absalom,  but)  by  Bass  from  his  domain  of 
premier  bowler  to  the  F.  F.  The  usurper  achieved  17 
wickets  and  twice  that  number  of  runs.  Verelst  made  21 
and  34  (not  out),  Buchanan  14  and  10. 

At  Perth,  too,  another  victory  was  scored,  the  home 
eleven  falling — 10  wickets  to  Buchanan  and  11  to  Bass — 
for  61  and  57  runs ;  while  F.  F.,  though  only  scoring  37 
in  the  first  innings,  obtained  the  required  number  in  the 
second  with  3  wickets  to  fall — -M'Donald  13  and  28,  Verelst 
o  and  25,  being  the  principal  scorers. 

No  matches  in  1869. 

1870. 

1870  saw  what  the  *  Scottish  Cricketers'  Annual'  desig- 
nated "the  almost  unimpeded  triumphal  march  of  the 
Free  Foresters." 

On  Aug.  I  and  2  they  played  at  Dalkeith,  where  the  home 
team  lost,  scoring  142  and  59  to  the  bowling  of  Buchanan 
and  Francis,  the  first  -  named  claiming  12  wickets,  the 
latter  7.  "  For  Foresters,  Francis,"  says  the  local  report, 
"  played  a  magnificent  innings,  his  only  bad  stroke  being 
his  last  one ;   his  bowling  in  both  innings  was  also  first- 


THE  REVERSE.  179 

rate.  Buchanan,  the  veteran  leader  of  his  eleven, 
bowled  with  his  usual  judgment,  proving  himself  to  be 
one  of  the  best  gentlemen  *  head '  bowlers  living."  For- 
esters made  155  and  47  for  i  wicket — C.  K.  Francis  60, 
J.  Smith  35  and  24  (not  out),  and  J.  Pennycuick  4  (not 
out)  and  20,  being  conspicuous. 

On  Aug.  3,  at  the  Fettes  College  ground,  the  Grange 
scored  157  and  109,  Free  Foresters  only  making  113  in 
the  first  innings,  but  in  the  second  wiping  off  the  balance 
with  6  wickets  to  spare.  C.  K.  Francis  scored  72  for  F.  R, 
and  J.  Speid  for  the  Grange  52. 

Aug.  5  found  F.  F.  at  Partick,  where  the  West  of  Scot- 
land made  118  and  got  out  F.  F.  for  59  runs.  The  second 
innings  of  the  home  eleven  produced  147,  and  then 
Foresters,  with  5  wickets  to  fall,  scored  116. 

On  the  8th,  in  a  one-day's  match  at  Kinning  Park, 
Clydesdale  got  Foresters  out  for  75,  but  only  made  39 
themselves.  "Although  the  Club  has  been  in  existence 
twenty  -  three  years,  the  score  recorded  was  nearly  the 
smallest  one  it  has  ever  made.  The  bowling  of  Mr 
Buchanan  was  too  much  for  the  bulk  of  the  eleven."  In 
the  second  innings  Foresters  scored  142  for  6  wickets — 
A.  Wilmot  75,  J.  Smith  26,  H.  Bass  22.  Buchanan  took  7 
Clydesdale  wickets. 

On  the  9th  Foresters  met  with  an  unexpected  reverse  at 
Greenock.  The  first  innings  of  Greenock  was  concluded 
by  luncheon-time  for  104,  Morton  and  Grieve  scoring  23 
each.  But  when  the  turn  of  F.  F.  came,  nobody  got 
into  double  figures  save  W.  H.  Richards  32,  and  H.  Bass 
17,  and  they  were  all  out  for  88. 

On  the  loth  and  nth  Drumpellier  scored  81  and  122 
for  6  wickets  to  the  Foresters'  single  innings  of  274.  C. 
K.  Francis  and  J.  Smith  made  60  and  66  respectively,  G. 
Simpson  32,  and  J.  Pennycuick  31.  Buchanan  took  10 
Scottish  wickets. 


i8o  OUR  BOWLER'S  DAY. 


1871. 

Free  Foresters  this  year  commenced  on  the  ist  of  Aug. 
at  Kelso,  the  home  team  claiming  a  victory  next  day  by 
8  wickets.  Kelso  made  182  in  their  first  innings,  of  which 
the  Marquess  of  Bowmont  contributed  42,  H.  G.  Wedder- 
burn  30,  T.  R.  Marshall  28.  Free  Foresters  only  scored 
117  and  71 — J.  H.  Raven  24  and  5,  L.  W.  Novelli  12  and 
27,  doing  best. 

In  a  one-day's  match  v.  the  Grange,  on  the  3d,  Foresters 
put  on  182  with  4  wickets  to  fall,  against  the  Grange's  170. 
For  the  home  side  J.  R.  Marshall  came  first  with  70,  H. 
Wedderburn  scored  32,  and  J.  Mylne  22  ;  L.  W.  Novelli 
for  Foresters  scored  65,  J.  H.  Raven  31,  G.  F.  Rayner  26, 
W.  F.  Higgins  24  (not  out). 

At  Dalkeith,  on  the  4th  and  5th,  they  got  out  the  natives 
for  109  and  79 — Rayner  53  (not  out)  and  8  the  best — and 
made  134  in  their  first  innings,  winning  by  8  wickets  ; 
R.  G.  Venables  scoring  71  and  31,  both  not  out,  E.  H. 
Warner  24  and  26. 

On  the  17th  and  i8th,  on  the  Partick  ground,  Glasgow, 
Free  Foresters  drew  with  the  West  of  Scotland,  making 
153  and  223  to  their  opponents'  loi  and  54  for  3  wickets 
— R.  G.  Venables  4  and  38,  W.  F.  Higgins  31  and  17,  L. 
W.  Novelli  33  and  35,  A.  Young  37  and  16,  D.  Buchanan 
12  and  34,  twice  not  out.^  For  the  Westerners  J.  R. 
Hutchison   32  and  4  (not  out)  did  best. 

^  This  is  Mr  Buchanan's  best  batting  performance  for  Free  Foresters,  but  it 
must  not  be  supposed  because  the  great  bowler  often  went  in  late  and  carried 
his  bat  for  infinitesimal  scores,  that  he  could  not  get  runs  on  occasion.  Apple- 
by recalls  the  incident  of  his  going  in  M'ith  him  first  in  an  eleven  of  J.  W. 
Dale's  against  Harrow  Wanderers  in  1873,  ^^^  staying  in  for  102,  Buchanan's 
contribution  being  21.  This  puts  one  in  mind  of  the  lady  at  Lord's  who  told 
her  friend  that  Mr  Grace — she  called  him  W.  G.,  and  blushed — "was  the 
only  man  who  had  made  a  hundred  ofif  his  own  bat."  "But  I  saw  Mr  Read 
make  a  hundred,"  was  the  reply.     "  Yes,  dear,  but  not  off  his  own  bat." 


''HAMLET  LEFT  OUT:'  i8i 

At  Greenock,  on  the  9th  Aug.,  the  local  club  made  41 
and  53  to  Foresters'  108,  of  which  Venables  contributed  44 
and  Warner  20.  And  they  finished  their  tour  by  another 
victory  on  the  two  next  days  at  Drumpellier,  where,  says 
the  reporter,  "  two  or  three  surprisals  came  off — to  wit,  the 
jerk  out  by  *our  David,'  the  wide  ball  of  *  our  David,'  and 
the  bowling  of  Bass  in  the  first  innings."  The  home 
eleven  made  117  and  %6.  Foresters — with  Higgins  42, 
Novelli  40,  and  Venables  36 — again  to  the  fore,  realised 
186,  and  won  by  8  wickets. 

During  this  tour  Buchanan  took  47  wickets,  Bass  15, 
Venables  17. 

1872. 

Free  Foresters  in  1872  had,  according  to  the  'Scottish 
Cricketers'  Annual,'  "  a  very  fair  team,  though  the  familiar 
face  of  Mr  D.  Buchanan  was  missed.  At  Glasgow  really 
good  batting  was  displayed  by  Novelli,  Tubb,  Tylecote, 
and  Hutchison.  Their  fielding  was  very  good,  but  the 
bowling  inclined  to  the  weak  side." 

They  began  at  Drumpellier  on  July  30,  and  getting  out 
the  home  eleven  for  64  and  97,  they  reached  the  total 
of  225,  T.  S.  Pearson  making  61,  and  H.  Tubb  52  (not 
out),  L.  W.  Novelli  32  and  J.  R.  Hutchison  21.  Tubb 
took  9  wickets,  Novelli  5,  of  the  Drumpellier  side. 

On  Aug.  I,  against  the  Grange  at  Edinburgh,  their 
score  was  297,  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  claiming  63,  Hutchison 
and  Warner  39  each,  Pearson  35,  Tubb  (not  out)  28, 
W.  F.  Higgins  25.  The  Grange  were  all  out  for  149, 
of  which  J.  M.  Cotterill  made  70 — c  and  b  Tubb. 

On  Aug.  2d  and  3d  Dalkeith  made  two  innings  of 
107  each  to  Foresters'  iii  and  106,  with  4  wickets  to 
fall.  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  was  here  to  the  front  with  31 
and  15,  T.  S.  Pearson  30  and  12,  L.  W.  Novelli  24 
and  (not  out)  5,  while  W.  F.  Higgins,  whose  score  was 


i82  A    WIN  FOR  DRUMPELLIER. 

blank  in  the  first  innings,  carried  out  his  bat  for  49  in 
the  second. 

On  the  5th,  however,  West  of  Scotland  at  Partick 
claimed  258  to  Free  Foresters'  173  and  128  with  7  wickets 
down — H.  Tubb  48  and  6  (not  out),  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  2 
and  42,  L.  W.  Novelli  38  and  2.  Chalmers  for  Glasgow 
made  a  not-out  innings  of  Z6. 

On  the  7th  Greenock  scored  yj,  and  then  Foresters 
amassed  281,  nine  of  the  eleven  getting  into  double  figures 
— T.  S.  Pearson  48,  the  best.  Tubb  and  Novelli  each 
took  5  Greenock  wickets. 

On  the  8th  F.  F.  vanquished  the  Glasgow  Caledonian 
in  one  innings  by  178  to  92  and  52.  Capt.  Watson  for 
F.  F.  made  43,  T.  S.  Pearson  40.  Of  the  16  wickets 
bowled  Tubb  claimed  11. 

No  tour  in  1873. 

1874. 

Aug.  3  and  4,  the  Grange  scored  180  and  273  against 
Free  Foresters — E.  M.  Bannerman  93  and  14  and  L.  M. 
Balfour  i  and  86  being  best  on  the  score.  F.  F.  made  213 
— E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  52,  T.  S.  Pearson  55,  T.  R.  Fleming 

54. 

Foresters  beat  Dalkeith  by  197  runs. 

Aug.  7  and  8,  Drumpellier  scored  70  and  103,  to  no 
and  45  made  by  Free  Foresters,  thus  winning  by  18  runs 
after  a  well-contested  match. 

Aug.  10  and  11,  West  of  Scotland  scored  166 — Clarke 
53,  Capt.  Soames  46 — and  F.  F.  84  for  four  wickets — E.  F. 
S.  Tylecote  43,  D.  Buchanan  (not  out)  13, — the  match  being 
drawn  owing  to  bad  weather.

1875. 

Aug.  2  and  3,  Grange  made  123  and  66)  but  Free 
Foresters  having  compiled  130  in  the  first  innings,  wiped 
out  the  runs  with  8  wickets  to  fall.  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  27 
and  43  (not  out),  T.  W.  Lang  22  and  12  (not  out),  and 
G.  F.  Rayner  47,  did  best. 

On  the  4th  and  5th,  Free  Foresters  played  against  Dal- 
keith at  Edinburgh,  and  in  their  first  innings  made  83 — 
T.  S.  Pearson,  28,  J.  W.  Hutchison  15 — while  Dalkeith, 
with  the  assistance  of  24  from  John  Craig,  equalled  their 
score.  Free  Foresters  next  scored  108,  Pearson  making 
58  ;  and  then  Dalkeith,  with  52  (not  out)  from  G.  F.  Ray- 
ner, won  by  2  wickets.  Lang  and  Pearson  were  the 
Forester  bowlers. 

On  the  6th  and  7th,  at  Partick,  Free  Foresters  got  166 
against  the  West  of  Scotland,  Pearson  making  33,  and 
W.  F.  Story  32.  West  of  Scotland  replied  with  202, — 
T.  Chalmers  yy,  J.  M'Neill  38.  Then  Free  Foresters 
scored  210  for  6  wickets — Story  67,  T.  W.  Lang  (not  out) 
52,  Lord  Elgin  (not  out)  24. 

The  9th  and  loth  were  devoted  to  a  match  with  Drum- 
pellier,  where  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  having  made  83,  and  Lord 
Elgin  30  (not  out),  the  total  of  Free  Foresters'  first  innings 
amounted  to  176.  Butler  and  Pearson  then  disposed  of 
their  opponents  for  94  and  97,  Lieut.  Story  22  and  40 
being  the  principal  contributor. 

1876. 

Free  Foresters  were  beaten  by  West  of  Scotland  at  Par- 
tick  on  the  7th  and  8th  of  Aug.  "  The  heavy  rains  which 
fell  within  the  last  few  days  rendered  the  ground  slippery 
and  marshy,  and  though  it  could  not  be  said  that  there

was  rain  during  the  course  of  the  play,  the  state  of  the 
field  was  not  improved  by  the  almost  unintermittent 
drizzle  that  fell,  making  everything  bleak  and  uncomfort- 
able." The  F.  F.  scores  were  92  and  61 — E.  F.  S.  Tylecote 
o  and  20,  T.  W.  Lang  29  and  6,  G.  Hughes  41  (not  out) 
and  2,  J.  R.  Hutchison  i  and  16.  Clarke  (pro.)  and 
Russell  bowled.  For  West  of  Scotland  J.  M'Neill  26,  and 
P.  B.  Russell  (not  out)  24,  headed  a  score  of  127,  and  Capt. 
Soames  was  (not  out)  14. 

At  Drumpellier  the  home  side  were  all  out  for  31  and 
52,  D.  Buchanan  taking  10  wickets,  Lang  8.  In  their  turn 
Free  Foresters  scored  106,  T.  S.  Pearson  claiming  38,  T. 
W.  Lang  26.

CHAPTER    XXIIL 


FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC. 


By  Edward  Lyttelton. 


There  seems  to  be  no  necessary  connection  between 
Cricket  and  Music.  It  would  be  difficult  to  say  that 
this  is  owing  to  the  somewhat  violent  science  of  the 
former  and  the  extreme  and  indescribable  delicacy  of 
the  latter  ;  since  in  various  quaint  and  uncouth  ways  we 
find  that  something  of  a  partnership  has  existed  between 
two  such  incongruous  accomplishments  as  music  and 
warfare.  We  are  familiar  with  stories  of  armies  being 
cheered  on  a  long  and  dusty  march  by  the  brass  band  ; 


i86  FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC. 

and  it  is  well  known  that  many  a  charge  in  battle  has 
owed  its  irresistible  fury  to  the  clarion-like  shouts  of  the 
attacking  party.  But  it  may  be  said  with  some  truth 
that  the  kind  of  music  which  these  instances  call  to  mind 
is  of  the  less  refined  order,  and  hardly  constitutes  a  serious 
exception  to  the  rule.  It  is  music  indeed,  but  effective  for 
its  purpose  because  it  requires  little  attention  in  the 
listener,  and  no  great  skill  in  the  performer. 

The  mention,  however,  of  the  brass  band  reminds  us 
that  a  certain  alliance  between  that  order  of  music  and 
cricket  has  existed  for  some  years.  Many  of  our  readers 
will  remember  gay  scenes  of  cricket-grounds  decked  with 
tents  and  banners,  and  with  a  galaxy  of  fair  women  and 
leisurely  young  men  ;  while  in  a  suitable  spot  is  drawn 
up  the  band,  which  plays  a  strange  hotch-potch  of  tunes 
of  the  most  various  quality,  such  as  Strauss'  Waltzes, 
Sullivan's  Lost  Chord,  and  the  overture  to  Tannhauser, 
during  the  fashionable  hours  of  the  afternoon.  Here 
again,  however,  we  must  hesitate  to  call  this  a  necessary 
connection  between  music  and  cricket.  Some  would  even 
go  so  far  as  to  say  that  the  connection  is  not  only  un- 
necessary but  unnatural.  Batsmen  have  been  known  to 
attribute  their  failure  in  an  innings — quite  inexplicable 
otherwise — to  the  sudden  and  intrusive  blare  of  the  cornet- 
d-piston  or  to  the  thunder  of  the  trombones ;  and  there 
is  indeed  some  reason  to  suppose  that  a  musical  mid-off 
might  find  it  uncommonly  hard  to  fix  his  thoughts  on 
the  next  ball  just  as  a  Vorspiel  of  Wagner's  is  reaching 
its  climax.  Cricketers,  in  short,  in  proportion  to  the  zest 
with  which  they  pursue  their  calling,  hesitate  to  approve 
of  the  combination  of  the  noble  game  and  the  brass  band. 
It  is  a  combination  which  is  far  less  fitting  than  that 
between  band  music  and  skating  as  we  remember  it  at 
Dresden,  where  the  players  set  the  time  to  rows  of  skaters 
whose  linked  hands  and  feet  plied  in   graceful   forward

curves  up  and  down  the  Teich,  This  partook  of  the  char- 
acter of  dancing,  and  no  one  supposes  that  music  is  out  of 
place  in  a  ball-room.  But  on  a  cricket-field  it  resembles 
the  brilliant  strains  to  be  heard  in  the  bull-baiting  arena 
in  Madrid,  where  the  tunes  are  intended — like  a  piano 
solo  at  an  evening  party — to  be  a  mere  disguise  to  the 
serious  business  which  has  brought  people  together. 

Nevertheless,  in  spite  of  this  broad  general  rule,  the 
Free  Foresters,  during  a  few  never-to-be-forgotten  years 
of  their  history,  established  an  alliance  between  these  two 
superb  but  very  different  arts,  which,  so  far  from  being 
unnatural  or  unfitting,  served  to  bring  out  in  fair  relief 
what  was  best  in  both.  It  is  the  purpose  of  this  chapter 
to  give  some  account  of  this  unique  development,  and 
the  extraordinary  success  and  delight  which  attended  it. 

Before  explaining  the  way  in  which  this  was  done,  we 
may  pause  to  consider  the  kind  of  combination  which  is 
possible,  if  music  is  to  be  real  music,  and  cricket  to  be 
in  no  way  interfered  with.  Probably  the  reader  will 
have  guessed  that  the  music  was  vocal  and  for  the  most 
part  unaccompanied ;  and  further,  that  the  singing  was 
not  in  chorus  but  in  quartette.  It  is  hardly  possible  to 
imagine  a  whole  cricket  eleven  capable  of  forming  a 
chorus,  but  it  would  be  quite  possible  to  have  four  good 
singers  frequently  playing  in  a  team  together.  Again, 
it  is  essentially  necessary  that  they  be  independent  of 
musical  instruments.  The  captain  of  the  side  cannot 
provide  a  piano  in  a  tent,  or  a  harmonium  close  to 
long-leg,  or  a  mandoline  in  the  scorer's  box.  But  he 
can  perfectly  well  add  a  bag  of  books  to  his  modest 
travelling  equipment,  and  those  books  may  contain  the 
most  priceless  treasures  of  vocal  part-music.  And  this 
was  precisely  what  was  done.  Often  and  often  during 
a  long  day's  fielding  a  quick  ear  among  the  spectators 
might  have  detected  something  resonant  in  the  tone  of 


l88  FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC. 

mid-on's  remonstrance  when  put  on  to  bowl  for  the  third 
time,  or  in  the  banter  which  passed  from  cover-point  to 
third-man  on  the  dropping  of  a  high  spinning  catch.  The 
truth  was  that  singers  were  interlarded  among  cricketers : 
not  that  we  mean  to  imply  that  they  were  soft  and  inert 
members  of  the  team — they  were  themselves  cricketers  of 
undoubted  prowess;  but  that  stout  and  hilarious  cover- 
point  sings  alto,  that  tall  and  black-bearded  bowler  is  a 
sonorous  bass,  that  unrivalled  long-stop  a  second  tenor, 
and  that  transparent-looking  short-slip  a  first  tenor,  who 
not  only  can  bowl  puzzling  "donkey-droppers,"  but  can 
render  Gounod's  Rossignol  with  a  singularly  finished  de- 
licacy of  style.  These,  or  others  of  a  like  calibre,  form  the 
Forester  quartette,  and  when  the  proper  time  comes  they 
will  show  how  cricket  and  music  may  be  combined. 

And  before  long  the  time  arrives.  There  is  no  cricketer 
alive  whose  memory  is  not  charged  with  the  dismal  in- 
cidents peculiar  to  a  cricket-match  stopped  by  rain.  The 
fieldsmen  come  trooping  in,  and  the  padded  batsmen 
behind  them,  running  with  less  eagerness.  The  tent  is 
charged  with  a  disconsolate  horde  of  onlookers  and 
players,  brooding  over  the  fun  they  are  losing:  ladies 
doing  their  best  to  make  things  cheery,  but  secretly 
musing  over  a  damp  walk  home,  or,  what  is  far  worse, 
a  drenching  wet  drive.  Everybody  feigns  a  cheerfulness 
that  nobody  feels  or  possibly  can  feel,  as  they  listen  to  the 
patter  of  the  remorseless  drops,  and  gloomily  view  the 
pitch  being  ruined  before  their  eyes.  There  is  only  one 
art  known  to  man  able  to  kill  this  "care  and  grief  of 
heart,"  and  that  is  sweet  music.  In  the  palmy  times  of  the 
Foresters,  on  occasions  like  these,  suddenly  the  cry  would 
be  heard,  "  Now,  Tom,  tune  up :  give  us  what  you  can ;  never 
mind  the  bullion,  sing  by  heart."  The  "  bullion,"  it  should 
be  explained,  had  no  connection  with  the  vexed  question 
of  bimetallism,    then    hardly   in   existence,   but   was   the 


THE   QUARTETTE,  189 

familiar  term  for  the  copies  of  the  Orpheus  glees  and 
other  compositions.  No  second  exhortation  is  required. 
The  quartette  are  soon  disposed,  sitting  back  to  back, 
round  the  tent-pole,  and  without  more  ado  the  lovely- 
strains  of  Integer  Vitcs  are  heard  welling  forth  to  the 
pleasant  accompaniment  of  the  rain  above,  lifting  our 
thoughts  away  from  life's  disappointments  to  a  serener 
region  where  pleasures  are  independent  of  the  humid 
south-west  wind.  It  would  be  difficult  to  find  a  better 
fulfilment  of  the  old  poet's  advice  to  men  to  bend  circum- 
stances to  their  will,  and  not  themselves  to  circumstances. 

Or  again,  supposing  the  weather  had  remained  fair, 
there  was  perhaps  the  evening  concert  to  be  faced. 
Possibly,  but  not  often,  a  few  moments  might  be  snatched 
from  the  early  afternoon  just  after  luncheon,  and  the 
four  singers  would  be  seen  under  a  distant  tree  humming 
over  a  few  "curly"  bars  in  "Strike  the  Lyre,"  or,  more 
puzzling  still,  "  Come,  let  us  join  the  roundelay."  Perhaps 
the  first  bass  was  new  to  his  work,  or  a  little  rusty  in 
memory.  But  generally  the  morning  practice  after  break- 
fast was  sufficient ;  and  they  were  prepared  to  do  battle 
as  genuine  cricketers  for  some  six  hours  in  the  day,  and 
sing  "without  mitigation  or  remorse  of  voice"  far  into  the 
night. 

But  it  was  not  only  in  the  summer  that  they  were  called 
upon  to  show  their  talent.  Not  unfrequently  a  winter 
concert  was  arranged  somewhere  in  the  Midland  Counties. 
What  do  cricketers  do  in  the  winter?  Various  answers 
might  be  given  to  this  question.  Ill-natured  critics  might 
suppose  that  they  pined  in  enforced  idleness,  waiting  like 
plants  and  trees  for  the  call  of  spring.  Some  work  at  the 
desk  in  England.  Some,  like  one  member  of  the  quar- 
tette, fly  abroad  to  avoid  the  fall  of  the  leaf  Some  dance, 
some  shoot ;  and  the  late  W.  Mycroft,  the  Derbyshire  pro-

ness  "  doon  the  mine,"  and  then,  after  a  few  rounds  in  the 
prize-ring  in  April,  was  ready  to  bowl  (or  throw)  for  six 
months  on  end.  But  the  vocal  cricketers  generally  pre- 
ferred singing.  It  was  a  great  treat  in  the  depths  of 
December  to  leave  for  a  while  the  heavier  duties  of  life, 
and  gather  to  some  kindly  welcome  like  that  twice  given 
by  Mr  (now  Dean)  Hole  at  Newark,  and  there  furbish  up 
the  familiar  glees,  and  crack  many  a  time-honoured  August 
joke,  too  happy  to  miss  "Apollo's  summer  look,"  in  the 
glow  of  a  really  hospitable  English  home.  Perhaps  the 
concert  was  followed  by  a  ball,  or  by  a  mount  with  the 
hounds,  or  some  erratic  shooting  at  driven  partridges. 
But  whatever  were  the  other  attractions  of  the  visit,  to 
the  singers  themselves  the  concert  was  invariably  the  best 
thing  of  all. 

It  would  be  possible,  now  that  we  have  gone  so  far,  to 
descant  long  and  fondly  on  days  spent  on  the  river,  as, 
for  instance,  on  a  glorious  summer  evening  at  Taplow 
Court  near  Maidenhead,  when  the  part-singing  by  moonlight 
caused  many  a  passing  boatful  of  cockneys  and  pleasure- 
seekers  to  wonder  where  in  the  world  they  were.  But  as 
this  was  an  instance  of  music  blended,  not  with  cricket, 
but  with  rowing,  we  must  reluctantly  leave  it,  as  not  being 
strictly  germane  to  our  subject.  One  occasion,  however, 
stands  out  too  prominently  in  our  recollection  to  be  passed 
over.  About  the  year  1877  the  quartette  assembled  at 
Trinity  College,  Cambridge,  for  some  informal  evening 
singing.  And  on  the  following  morning  it  occurred  to 
one  of  the  party  that  a  far  better  place  for  part-singing 
than  rooms  in  Neville's  Court  would  be  the  lecture-room 
staircase  in  the  Great  Court.  Thither  they  repaired,  about 
1 1. 15  A.M.,  when  all  studious  members  of  the  College  were 
busily  engaged  in  wooing  various  Muses.  Never  before 
or  since  has  part  -  singing  been  heard  on  that  staircase, 
but  nowhere  from  John  o'  Groat's  to  Land's  End  could  a

place  be  found  more  perfectly  adapted  to  make  the  best 
of  the  human  voice.  At  first  quietly,  as  if  in  awe  of  the 
august  and  scholastic  surroundings,  "  the  coronach  stole " 
"  from  stair  to  stair,"  the  echoes  blending  the  voices  into 
full  rich  melody.  But  at  last  the  triumphant  ending  of 
"  Shall  I,  wasting  in  despair?"  at  the  words  "What  care  I 
how  fair  she  be  ?  "  broke  down  all  reserve.  There  was  a 
sudden  spontaneous  shout,  of  five  times  the  usual  volume 
of  sound,  which  rang  far  across  the  quad,  and  drowned  the 
voice  of  the  junior  proctor  lecturing  hard  by  on  hydro- 
statics. It  so  happened  that  there  was  no  wild  swan  to 
pause  in  the  cloud,  but  gyps  and  bed-makers  stood  aston- 
ied  on  door-mats,  and  gazed  at  each  other  with  a  wild 
surmise  :  and  it  is  credibly  reported  that  an  aged  senior 
wrangler,  passing  below,  stopped  dead  in  the  middle  of 
a  problem,  and  stood  spellbound  in  a  chaos  of  emotions, 
marvelling  whence  the  melody  came,  and  who  was  the 
gentle  heroine  of  the  song  ;  and  not  till  ten  good  minutes 
had  passed  did  he  stiffly  resume  his  walk  to  his  rooms, 
still  labouring  with  dim  memories  so  rudely  awakened  of 
a  timid  and  uncompleted  romance  at  Tooting  full  fifty 
years  before. 

But  our  readers  may  ask  how  it  was  that  ordinary 
part-singing  came  to  occupy  so  prominent  a  place  in 
the  memories  of  those  who  were  concerned.  As  a  general 
rule,  it  cannot  be  denied  that  quartette  singing  is  far  more 
rewarding  to  the  singers  than  to  the  listeners.  In  an 
ordinary  concert  in  England,  there  is  one  piece  in  the 
programme  which  is  admittedly  inserted  merely  as  pad- 
ding, generally  at  the  very  beginning,  to  give  the  people 
time  to  get  settled  into  their  places — the  ladies  to  arrange 
their  skirts,  the  men  to  cross  their  legs.  This  is  the 
pianoforte  solo  or  duet.  But  next  to  this,  a  vocal  quar- 
tette is  for  the  most  part  regarded  as  a  harmless,  not 
unpleasing,  little   effort,    which   is   not  worth  very  much 


192  FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC. 

attention  unless  it  be  a  roaring  catch  or  the  vehicle  of 
some  absurdly  comic  words.  If,  as  has  already  been 
hinted,  the  Forester  quartette  became  something  better 
than  this,  it  will  be  well  that  some  idea  be  given  of  the 
requirements  and  shortcomings  of  ordinary  part-singing, 
so  that  it  may  be  made  clear  what  prevalent  faults  the 
singers  in  question  were  able  to  avoid. 

In  the  first  place,  to  catch  and  rivet  the  attention  of  an 
audience  with  music,  it  is  above  all  things  necessary  that 
the  performers  shall  have  a  clear  idea  what  is  the  meaning 
of  the  composition.  Next,  that  they  should  endeavour 
to  express  it.  This  is  true  of  all  music  ;  but  in  the  case  of 
vocal  music  the  question  becomes  complicated,  owing  to 
the  presence  of  words  as  well  as  melody.  Now,  singers 
have  a  choice  before  them.  They  can  either  confine  their 
attention  to  the  music  and  slur  the  words,  or,  vice  versa, 
they  can  pronounce  the  words  so  ultra  distinctly  that  the 
rhythm  of  the  tune  is  interrupted.  Thirdly,  they  can  aim 
at  both  in  due  proportion ;  fourthly,  they  can  succeed 
in  neither.  But  no  good  singer  will  adopt  the  same 
method  for  all  songs  and  all  audiences.  Some  songs  are 
first-rate  because  of  their  music,  though  the  words  be 
paltry, — such  as  many  of  the  old  Italian  schools.  Others 
are  charming  owing  to  the  beauty  of  the  words,  though 
the  music  be  unvocal ;  this  is  the  case  with  some  of  Schu- 
mann's. In  the  old  English  ballads  the  combination  is 
quite  perfect.  It  would  be  impossible  to  conceive  of  the 
music  of  "  Barbara  Allen "  expressing  any  other  words, 
or  those  words  being  set  to  any  other  music.  But  it 
very  seldom  happens  that  the  words  are  so  perfectly 
adapted  to  the  music  that  a  careful  rendering  of  the 
music  necessarily  involves  an  adequate  expression  of 
the  words.  It  is  nearly  always  the  case  that  a  singer 
can  give  his  best  to  either  one  or  the  other,  while  very 
few   are   equally   strong    in    both.      But   the   problem   is 


PART  SONGS.  193 

not  solved  when  these  simple  principles  are  grasped. 
The  further  question  arises  in  connection  with  the  audi- 
ence. If,  as  is  highly  improbable,  a  concert  audience 
be  so  musically  intelligent  as  to  take  delight  in  the 
harmonies  of  a  part-song,  or  in  the  accompaniment  of  a 
solo,  merely  as  music,  then  it  is  not  necessary  to  be  very 
careful  about  the  choice  or  the  articulation  of  the  words, 
in  order  to  produce  an  effect.  But  in  a  general  way  an 
audience  will  strive  to  catch  the  words,  and  is  only  thor- 
oughly pleased  if  it  succeeds  in  doing  so,  and  at  the  same 
time  enjoys  the  simple  refrain  as  a  vehicle  for  the  story. 
Therefore  to  succeed  in  a  concert,  the  first  essential  is 
that  the  words  be  well  delivered  ;  the  second  is,  that  the 
voice  be  pleasing ;  the  third  is,  that  the  tune  be  attractive. 
All  this  makes  it  obvious  why  part-singing  is  so  seldom 
effective  in  a  concert.  It  is  more  difficult  to  catch  the 
words  when  four  people  are  singing  than  when  one  is  ; 
though  even  in  the  latter  case  it  often  demands  prolonged 
attention  to  make  out  even  what  language  is  being  rendered. 
Again,  a  vast  number  of  part-songs  consist  of  vapid  words 
set  to  good  music ;  but  even  if  the  music  be  faithfully 
rendered,  nothing  will  atone  with  a  popular  audience  for 
the  loss  of  good  words,  when  every  one  is  striving  to  "make 
out  what  it  is  all  about,"  and  can  only  catch  here  and  there 
lifeless  and  obsolete  allusions  to  Thyrsis  and  Daphne. 
Long  before  they  have  begun  to  pay  attention  to  the 
music,  the  three  verses  are  at  an  end,  and  the  performance 
is  a  flat  failure.  And  if  such  be  the  difficulties  inherent  in 
the  quartette,  what  shall  be  said  of  the  singers?  The 
commonest  fault  of  all  is  bad  pronunciation  of  words.  The 
next  is  shyness.  When  an  Englishman  is  shy  he  is 
funereal ;  and  if  he  be  singing  jovial  words  in  a  funereal 
manner,  it  is  better  that  he  slur  them  over  rather  than  let 
the  audience  see  the  painful  incongruity.  And  without 
exaggeration  it  may  be  said  that,  considering  the  demands 

N

of  an  ordinary  audience,  it  is  astonishing  how  few  quartette 
singers  manage  to  put  life  and  expression  into  their  words. 
Again,  very  often  the  voices  do  not  blend.  Nobody  knows 
why  some  voices  blend  and  some  do  not.  It  cannot  be 
predicted,  but  an  experiment  sets  the  question  at  rest ; 
and  if  one  voice  out  of  four  fails  to  blend,  it  draws  the 
attention  of  the  audience  to  itself,  and  many  beauties  and 
much  of  the  meaning  of  the  composition  are  lost.  Then 
there  are,  of  course,  wrong  notes,  and  also  the  peculiar 
dulness  and  monotony  which  comes  of  imperfect  acquaint- 
ance with  the  piece,  and  from  a  certain  dark  misgiving  in 
each  singer's  heart  that  at  the  next  turn  of  the  page  there 
will  be  a  catastrophe. 

From  most,  not  quite  from  all,  of  these  defects  the 
Forester  quartette  was  singularly  free.  The  first  pre- 
caution they  took  was,  as  a  rule,  to  have  the  words  printed 
in  all  the  programmes,  so  that  if  the  articulation  of  all  the 
singers  was  short  of  perfection,  as  was  certainly  often  the 
case,  yet  the  audience  should  not  be  baulked  of  its  first 
great  demand,  the  sense  of  the  piece.  It  is  undoubtedly 
a  lamentable  fact  that  this  is  seldom  done.  A  good 
English  or  German  composer  ponders  first  on  the  full 
meaning  of  his  words  before  he  thinks  of  his  music ;  but 
the  English  public  are  supposed  to  be  able  to  get  at  his 
idea  by  their  unassisted  intellect,  though  they  can't  hear  a 
single  word  from  start  to  finish.  It  is  a  sheer  impossibility, 
and  the  attempt  to  do  without  printed  words  at  once 
ensures  the  failure  of  all  the  lovely  part-songs  the  words 
of  which  are  dull  or  out  of  date,  such  as  ninety-nine  per 
cent  of  all  those  of  the  best  English  composers.  But  put 
the  words  in  plain  print  before  the  audience,  and  they  will 
with  a  glance  take  in  what  Damon  said  to  Phyllis,  or,  if  it 
be  a  modern  piece,  why,  there  is  sure  to  be  something 
about  angels  and  graveyards  somewhere  before  the  end. 
They  then  can  give  their  attention  to  the  music  ;  they  will 


WORDS  IN  PRINT.  195 

anticipate  a  change  of  key  to  suit  a  change  of  words,  and 
will  be  keenly  interested  in  seeing  how  the  composer  has 
interpreted  the  sense  of  a  particular  distich.  These  secrets 
were  known  and  acted  on  by  the  Foresters  almost  from 
the  very  first.  Come  what  might,  let  the  listeners  anyhow 
know  what  the  song  is  meant  to  say. 

In  the  next  place,  they  were,  as  a  rule,  thoroughly 
familiar  with  the  pieces  to  be  performed.  This  was,  of 
course,  due  to  a  good  deal  of  practice,  and  very  frequent 
singing  together,  and  latterly,  it  must  be  confessed,  to  a 
somewhat  restricted  repertoire,  owing  to  the  imperfect 
powers  of  reading  new  music  which  characterised  one  or 
two  of  the  singers.  But  the  classical  part-songs,  such  as 
"  Strike,  strike  the  Lyre,"  "  When  Evening's  Twilight," 
"The  Two  Roses,"  and  many  others,  can  hardly  be  re- 
peated too  often  or  be  too  well  known.  Hence  their  singing 
was  free  from  monotony.  Every  composition  requires 
variety  of  treatment  in  different  places,  and  this  was  given 
without  effort,  and  with  a  singular  unanimity  of  tone  and 
exactness  of  time.  When  the  time  changed,  as  it  fre- 
quently did  to  bring  out  the  expression,  the  audience  were 
taken  by  surprise  but  the  singers  never,  and  very  often  it 
was  like  one  individual  varying  his  tones  in  a  solo,  so 
perfect  was  the  rapport  which  existed  between  the  voices. 

Thirdly,  the  four  parts  were  well  balanced.  That  is  to 
say,  as  a  general  rule  the  two  outside  voices,  alto  and  bass, 
were  stronger  than  the  tenor  and  first  bass ;  or  if,  as  some- 
times happened,  the  bass  was  not  as  strong  as  the  alto,  the 
other  voices  were  sufficiently  subdued  to  maintain  the  re- 
lation unimpaired.     This  is  not  by  any  means  easy  to  do. 

But  the  real  secret  of  the  success  of  the  Forester  quartette 
unquestionably  lay  in  this  fact.  One  of  the  singers,  Tom 
Ratliff,  the  alto,  without  whom  the  quartette  would  never 
have  come  into  existence,  was  possessed  of  a  singular  and 
almost  unique  dramatic  gift.     At  the  risk  of  being  thought 


196  FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC. 

a  little  over-analytical,  we  must  explain  what  we  mean  by 
the  expression. 

Put  quite  briefly,  a  dramatic  gift  is  the  power  of  ex- 
pressing feelings  so  vividly  as  to  carry  the  feelings  of  the 
audience  along  with  the  actor  or  speaker  or  singer.  But 
how  are  they  to  know  what  those  feelings  are  ?  It  is 
interesting  to  see  how  an  accomplished  public  speaker,  as 
a  general  rule,  indulges  in  a  few  sonorous  platitudes  or 
timely  jokes  at  the  beginning  of  his  speech,  simply  to 
ascertain  the  exact  prevailing  tone  of  feeling  in  the  room. 
Every  audience  is  in  a  certain  key,  as  some  people  say 
every  building  is  better  suited  to  one  key  than  another. 
Mr  Gladstone  was  once  heard  to  say  that  in  his  great 
Budget  speeches — the  greatest  and  by  far  the  most  in- 
teresting that  have  ever  been  delivered — he  forebore  to 
arrange  beforehand  the  order  in  which  the  different  topics 
should  be  taken,  but  waited  till  he  felt  the  pulse  of  the 
House,  and  was  able  to  see  what  they  wanted  and  how  he 
could  best  give  it  them.  And  of  another  supreme  orator. 
Bishop  Wilberforce  of  Oxford,  it  is  recorded  that  on  one 
occasion,  on  mounting  a  pulpit  with  a  sermon  ready  pre- 
pared in  his  head,  he  discovered  somehow  that  it  would 
not  be  suitable  to  the  particular  audience  at  that  particular 
time,  and  without  a  second's  hesitation  delivered  another 
magnificent  address  on  a  totally  different  subject. 

Now,  let  us  consider  for  a  moment  how  this  bears  upon 
the  question  of  part-song  singing.  To  produce  an  effect, 
the  opening  songs  of  a  concert  ought  to  be  such  as  suit 
the  prevailing  tone  of  the  audience,  and  the  great  difficulty 
is  to  ascertain  this  tone.  The  speaker,  as  we  have  said, 
cracks  a  few  jokes  simply  to  hear  the  people  laugh ;  at 
any  cost  they  must  express  themselves  early  and  clearly, 
and  show  of  what  sort  they  are.  How  are  singers  to  get 
them  to  do  this  ? 

In  an  ordinary  concert  a  great  deal  can  be  done  by  a

good  chairman.  Two  or  three  felicitous  remarks  at  the 
beginning  sets  every  one  in  a  good  humour :  a  cheery- 
demeanour  makes  it  evident  that  he  at  least  expects  a 
pleasant  evening,  and  so  the  very  common  evil  is  avoided 
of  having  to  wait  for  the  audience  to  thaw  from  the  con- 
dition of  glacial  depression  in  which  English  people  fre- 
quently set  themselves  to  listen  to  music.  But  if  there 
is  no  chairman,  the  singers  must  manage  this  themselves. 
The  only  singer  we  have  ever  seen  or  heard  who  never 
failed  in  the  attempt  was  Tom  Ratlifif.  It  is  true  that 
he  was  acted  upon  by  his  audience  sometimes  unfavour- 
ably. When  singing  for  the  first  time  in  a  strange  locality, 
he  would  be  less  confident  about  the  beginning  of  a  con- 
cert than  when,  as  at  Worcester  or  Newark,  he  was  well 
known,  and  a  single  glance  at  some  familiar  faces  was 
sufficient  to  show  him  that  the  listeners  were  really  eager 
for  the  best  that  he  could  give  them,  and  knew  what  style 
to  expect.  On  these  occasions  he  would  choose  some 
such  piece  as  "  The  Tar's  Song,"  by  Hatton,  and  take  up 
his  stand,  with  the  three  others  ranged  in  a  slight  curve 
alongside  of  him,  waiting  till  the  audience  was  absolutely 
quiet.  Then  with  the  fore-finger  raised,  preparatory  to 
giving  the  first  beat,  he  would  often  catch,  or  pretend  to 
catch,  the  eye  of  some  acquaintance  in  a  far  corner,  and 
just  as  every  one  was  looking  at  him,  a  smile  of  the  most 
irresistible  geniality  would  play  over  his  mobile  features 
and  almost  at  the  same  moment  the  words  would  be 
heard  of  the  opening  alto  solo,  delivered  with  the  most 
living  intonation,  "  Our  ship  now  goes  with  a  pleasant  gale," 
and  in  a  few  minutes  his  high  C,  at  the  words  "  So  clear 
your  pipes"  rang  out  like  a  clarion,  to  be  followed  by 
"  and  join  in  our  heave  ho  ! "  when  he  would  be  seen  giv- 
ing an  indescribable  nautical  hitch  at  his  breeches,  not 
because  it  was  proper  to  the  part,  but  with  the  air  of  one 
who  could   not  sing   the  words   without   an   appropriate

gesture.  And  so  it  went  on  till  the  unison  burst,  "  Cheer- 
ily, my  men,"  ended  with  a  piano  "  Heave  ho ! "  the  last 
note  "  lingering  and  wandering  on  as  loath  to  die."  At  the 
end  of  such  a  piece  of  singing  as  this  everybody  was 
happy :  the  ticket-holders  felt  that  they  were  getting  ex- 
actly what  they  wanted  ;  they  were  ready  to  welcome  the 
next  solo  with  applause,  and  every  performer  was  aware 
of  a  general  cordiality  diffused  throughout  the  premises  to 
the  farthest  recesses  of  the  green-room.  How  astonishingly 
different  from  the  usual  beginning  of  a  charity  concert ! 

But  to  say  that  Tom  Ratliff  was  possessed  of  a  remark- 
able dramatic  instinct  by  no  means  exhausts  the  subject. 
It  is  necessary  for  us  to  dwell  on  his  qualifications  at  some 
length,  since  it  is  quite  undeniable  that  the  success  of  the 
quartette  was  as  much  due  to  him  as  the  supremacy  of 
Thebes  was  due  to  Epaminondas,  or  that  of  Gloucester- 
shire county  cricket  to  W.  G.  Grace.  With  him  the 
singing  began,  and  with  him,  alas !  it  decayed  and  ended. 
The  other  singers  may  have  sung  since,  with  pleasure 
to  others  and  to  themselves,  but  never  again  with  the 
same  exhilaration  as  in  the  days  when  Tom  was  the  leader 
of  the  choir.  In  proof  of  this  statement  the  following  fact 
may  be  adduced.  On  a  comparatively  recent  occasion, 
somewhere  about  the  year  1885,  some  quartette  singing 
was  arranged  for  the  benefit  of  the  Eton  Mission  at 
Hackney  Wick.  Three  of  the  quartette  were  Foresters, — 
that  is  to  say,  George  Longman,  tenor,  Edward  Lyttelton, 
first  bass,  and  his  brother  Spencer,  second  bass ;  but  in 
place  of  Tom  as  alto  was  a  thoroughly  skilled  and  finished 
counter-tenor,  who  rendered  the  part-songs  along  with 
the  others  in  as  artistic  a  way  as  any  one  could  wish  for. 
Moreover,  the  songs  that  were  sung  were  exactly  those 
which  produced  the  greatest  effect  when  Ratliff  had  been 
among  us.  Not  a  single  encore  was  asked  for,  not  a  single 
thrill  of  delight  in   the  audience  was   perceptible.     The

singers  looked  and  waited  at  each  well-known  cadence, 
and  did  their  utmost  to  reproduce  the  turns,  the  pauses, 
the  phrasing  of  their  leader.  All  was  as  good  as  it  could 
be,  except  that  Tom  was  not  there  ;  and  that  is  tanta- 
mount to  saying  that  the  quartette,  in  spite  of  its  excel- 
lence, was  to  the  audience  an  ordinary  quartette,  and 
shared  the  inevitable  fate  of  all  such.  We  read  that, 
during  the  French  Revolution,  a  citizen  went  out  on  to  the 
Boulevards  and  met  a  friend,  with  a  cheery  salutation  to 
the  effect  that  it  was  a  fine  bright  day.  The  answer  was, 
"  Oui,  monsieur,  mais  Mirabeau  est  mort."  In  the  same 
way  the  Foresters  have  occasionally  gathered  together 
in  lonely  couples,  or  three  together,  to  try  to  recall  some- 
thing of  the  spirit  of  old  times — but  it  is  in  vain  :  a  void 
has  been  made  which  nothing  will  ever  fill  up  again. 

But  it  is  time  to  say  something  of  the  coadjutors  of  this 
remarkable  artist  before  we  pass  on  to  describe  more 
exactly  the  method  they  adopted  in  part-singing. 

We  must  begin  by  saying  that  the  records,^  on  which  we 
have  to  depend  for  any  history  of  the  Forester  concerts, 
bear  all  the  signs  of  having  been  collected  some  time  after 
the  singing  had  begun.  They  consist  of  two  large  volumes, 
containing  numberless  cricket  scores  and  accounts  of  con- 
certs, programmes,  &amp;c.,  besides  some  charming  illustrations 
in  water-colour  and  ink,  and  some  very  valuable  photo- 
graphs of  groups.  From  these  we  can  extract  a  certain  num- 
ber of  facts  which  tell  us  who  the  singers  were,  but  not,  un- 
fortunately, how  the  quartette  originally  came  into  being. 

The  first  concert  recorded  was  at  Worcester  on  Aug.  12, 
1872:  the  first  part-song  given  was  "The  Summer  Eve," 
by  Hatton,  at  all  times  a  favourite  one  to  start  with.  The 
quartette  were  Tom  Ratlifif,  the  Hon.  Rev.  John  Marsham, 
Muir  Mackenzie,  and  Herbert  Marshall.  We  find,  strangely 
enough,  that  Spencer  Lyttelton — a  most  familiar  figure  later 
^  Now  in  the  possession  of  Mr  Herbert  Marshall.

on — was  singing  a  solo  at  the  concert,  but  not  joining  the 
quartette.  It  was  seldom  in  later  times  that  the  singers 
were  reinforced  by  the  excellent  musical  accuracy  of  Muir 
Mackenzie,  who  combined  a  thoroughly  good  blending 
voice  with  sound  knowledge.  Herbert  Marshall,  after  a 
year  or  two,  was  the  regular  first  bass  till,  from  1876, 
Edward  Lyttelton  sometimes  took  his  place,  it  being  of 
course  an  advantage  to  have  two  brothers  singing  together, 
as  their  voices  are  pretty  sure  to  blend.  It  is  not  necessary 
to  say  much  of  Spencer  Lyttelton,  as  he  was  for  many 
years  well  known  as  a  first-rate  amateur  bass.  He  had 
all  the  native  qualifications  for  part-singing,  the  quality 
of  his  voice  being  peculiarly  soft  and  smooth,  and  telling 
with  great  effect  in  such  a  legato  passage  as  that  in  "Come, 
gentle  Zephyr."  In  John  Marsham  the  Foresters  possessed 
a  comedian  fit  to  rival  Ratliff  in  social  life,  though  not  on 
the  platform,  unsurpassed  as  a  raconteur  and  letter-writer. 
It  was  somewhat  uncertain  work  bringing  him  and  Tom 
together,  as  the  foolery  which  resulted  threatened  to  upset 
the  orderliness  of  the  evening's  proceedings;  but  in  a  quar- 
tette the  former  was  graver  than  usual,  owing  to  a  laudable 
desire,  not  always  fully  gratified,  of  hitting  the  right  note 
in  the  very  centre.  His  excellent  solo  singing  was  always 
a  feature  of  the  concerts  in  which  he  took  part,  and  in 
"  Old  Thomas  Day "  we  have  seen  him  as  good  as  could 
be.  When  a  soprano  quartette  was  required,  there  was  no 
one  who  could  take  the  top  part  better,  or  who  was  more 
deservedly  popular  on  the  platform  or  in  the  drawing-room, 
than  Mrs  John,  and  her  solo  singing,  especially  in  "My 
Mother  Bids  Me,"  was  a  real  treat,  owing  to  the  rich  and 
sympathetic  tone  of  her  voice. 

The  next  concert  we  read  of  was  at  Rugby,  where  we 
find  two  Humes  helping,  and  in  July  1873,  for  the  first 
time,  E.  Bray,  a  slow  bowler  of  renown,  and  a  peculiarly 
refined  light  tenor.     An  excellent  reader  and  as  true  a

singer  as  could  be  found,  he  was  invaluable  in  all  the 
softer  pieces,  and  the  sound  of  his  soft  birdlike  tones  in 
"  Celia's  Arbour"  will  not  be  forgotten.  In  louder  pieces 
he  was  hardly  strong  enough  ;  but  for  an  evening's  sing 
in  the  hall  of  a  country  house,  with  the  four  singers  sitting 
close  together  and  rendering  all  the  old  plaintive  favourites, 
one  after  another,  the  best  tenor  possible  was  Teddy  Bray. 
During  1873  there  were  numerous  performances  through 
the  summer  and  winter,  ending  with  one  at  Ashburn  in 
November,  when  E.  Wilson  took  the  tenor  part.  In  Jan. 
1874  an  amazing  fact  is  recorded:  Tom  Ratliff  is  credited 
with  a  French  solo  !  Certain  it  is  that  "  no  mortal  wight 
had  ere  that  night"  heard  a  French  sentence  proceed  from 
the  door  of  his  lips,  and  it  would  be  difficult  to  imagine 
even  him  putting  much  meaning  into  the  words — 

"  Avec  ivresse  et  sans  effroi 
Je  braverais  la  mort  pour  toi " — 

even  if  he  ever  understood  their  meaning,  which  is  wholly 
out  of  the  question.  And  as,  not  long  after,  we  find  Teddy 
Bray  singing  this  very  song,  in  an  excellent  French  accent, 
it  seems  highly  probable  that  Ratliff  has  been  credited  by 
the  printer  of  the  programme  with  linguistic  powers  to 
which  he  would  have  been  the  last  to  lay  any  claim. 

We  have  forgotten  to  mention  that  about  1875  G.  H. 
Longman  made  his  appearance  in  the  quartette  as  a  sound 
and  trustworthy  first  tenor,  adding  one  more  to  the  list  of 
first-rate  cricketers  of  vocal  talent.  And  this  reminds  us 
of  a  fact  worthy  of  mention,  that  it  was  quite  possible  for 
the  Foresters  to  put  on  a  platform  together  a  galaxy  of 
vocalists  all  of  whom  had  played  in  the  University  match. 
Suppose  a  glee  such  as  "  The  Cloud-capped  Towers  "  was 
being  sung.  We  should  have  had  Ratliff  for  the  top  part, 
as  a  cricketer  once  fully  up  to  University  standard.  Bray

first  basses  (the  latter  being  a  very  rare  visitant,  but  still 
able  to  help  at  a  pinch),  and  Edward  and  Spencer  Lyttelton 
as  second  basses.  Add  to  these  E.  Hume,  and  possibly 
R.  H.  Lyttelton,  and  the  combination  of  the  two  arts  be- 
comes sufficiently  remarkable.  On  one  occasion,  at  Wor- 
cester, an  octette  was  got  together  very  similar  to  the  one 
we  have  sketched. 

In  trying  to  give  our  readers  some  idea  of  the  method 
of  the  Forester  quartette  we  find  ourselves  obliged  to 
recur  to  Tom  Ratliff,  and  perhaps,  as  he  was  always  the 
most  striking  object  on  the  platform,  not  only  to  the  ear 
but  to  the  eye,  we  had  better  describe  briefly  his  appear- 
ance. A  stout  grey-haired  man,  with  a  large  rubicund 
face,  and  a  certain  looseness  of  limb,  generally  perceptible 
among  middle-aged  cricketers,  was  apparently  all  that 
was  to  be  noticed  about  the  alto  of  the  quartette.  But 
when  he  began  to  sing,  the  extraordinary  mobility  of  his 
ample  jowl  and  capacious  mouth,  the  indescribable  con- 
tagiousness of  his  smile,  and  the  roving  glance  of  his 
liquid  blue  eye,  soon  arrested  the  attention  of  every  one 
in  the  room,  even  if  his  grand  falsetto  had  not  done  so. 
When  engaged  in  a  pleading  and  pathetic  piece  like 
"  By  Celia's  Arbour,"  he  would  often  lower  his  book  and 
raise  his  eyes  to  the  ceiling,  displaying  to  view  the  ample 
volume  of  his  throat,  and  depicting  every  passing  mood 
of  the  music  on  his  face  as  he  poured  out  the  sound.^ 
But,  as  will  have  been  already  inferred,  his  greatest  powers 
were  best  seen  in  some  light  melodious  piece  like  "  Banish, 
oh  Maiden,"  or  "  I  know  a  Maiden  fair  to  see."  The 
first  of  these  two  soon  became  a  great  favourite.  From 
the  beginning  to  the  end  of  it,  every  note  was  delivered 
by  him    with   all   the    mock   fervour   of  an    impassioned 

^  This  is  the  attitude  caught  in  an  admirably  clever  caricature  by  Mr  A.  C. 
James  of  Eton  College,  drawn  after  a  concert  given  about  1886.  It  is  now  in 
the  possession  of  Mr  E.  Lyttelton  at  Haileybury  College.

lover  pleading  with  a  mistress  whose  looks  were  coy 
and  cold,  exactly  as  if  she  stood  visibly  before  him,  and 
all  the  time  the  most  roguish  smile  showed  how  com- 
pletely he  entered  into  the  farcical  humour  of  the  situation. 
His  burly  and  most  unromantic  proportions  gave  a  de- 
lightful comicality  to  the  skittish  sham  pathos  of  the 
words — 

"  Or  if  a  frown  must  that  smile  chase  away, 
Why,  frown  then  to-morrow,  but  kiss  me  to-day  " — 

the  last  two  syllables  being  delivered  with  most  telling 
effect  after  the  other  three  voices,  as  a  sort  of  echo,  the 
pause  of  which  could  only  be  attributed  to  the  profound 
sentiment  simulated  by  the  singer.  As  a  rule,  he  would 
improve  on  all  this  by  addressing  his  blandishments  to 
the  first  tenor  next  him,  generally  some  sinewy  middle- 
aged  and  married  cricketer,  whose  stolidity  was  an  admir- 
able set-off  to  Ratliff's  fooling.  But  his  old  associates 
knew  too  well  what  was  coming,  and  enjoyed  the  fun  too 
thoroughly  to  be  able  to  feign  unconsciousness.  Once 
only  was  this  seen  in  high  perfection.  The  tenor  had 
failed,  and  a  minor  canon  of  Worcester  Cathedral  kindly 
came  to  the  rescue,  and  sang  the  part  through  the  concert 
with  the  most  praiseworthy  fidelity.  But  when  it  came — as 
sooner  or  later  was  inevitable — to  "  Banish,  oh  Maiden," 
the  effect  was  unconsciously  ludicrous.  The  tenor  plodded 
on  as  conscientiously  and  seriously  through  the  unfamiliar 
phrases  as  if  they  had  been  part  of  a  new  Magnificat, 
while  Ratliff  was  pouring  into  his  wholly  unconscious  ear 
the  tenderest  solicitations  and  most  irrelevant  endear- 
ments, combining  all  the  pleading  power  of  voice  and 
eye  with  a  roguish  merriment  which  no  one  will  ever 
forget  who  once  saw  it,  but  which,  alas !  no  power  of 
language  or  pencil  will  ever  reproduce. 

The  same  comedian's  power  was  singularly  noticeable 
in  such  pieces  as  "  I  know  a  Maiden  fair  to  see,"  where

the  "side  glance"  was  irresistible,  and  in  the  ridiculous 
old  catch  "  Old  Thomas  Day."  Towards  the  close  of 
this  we  have  seen  him  with  handkerchief  in  hand,  and 
literally  a  big  tear  on  his  cheek,  sobbing  out  nonsense, 
with  the  whole  audience  and  the  other  singers  incap- 
acitated with  laughter.  And  in  the  last  line,  after  a 
long  dramatic  pause,  he  would  groan  out  the  words 
"Poor  soul"  with  the  deepest  intensity  of  feeling,  and 
then,  with  a  slight  shade  of  annoyance  at  his  questioner's 
stupidity,  "  No,  no,"  followed  by  the  tragic  admission,  "  Ay, 
ay,"  delivered  with  the  solemnity  of  an  undertaker  at  a 
funeral.  The  remaining  syllables  were  generally  lost  in  sobs. 
There  were  times,  however,  when  the  infectious  expres- 
siveness of  Ratliff's  face  was  a  hindrance  rather  than  a 
help.  As  every  experienced  concert-singer  knows,  there  are 
times  when  a  dismal  collapse  seems  imminent :  something 
has  gone  askew  ;  a  wrong  page  has  been  turned,  or  a  repeat 
forgotten  by  somebody,  and  nobody  can  conceive  how  the 
crisis  is  to  be  met.  Now,  the  first  requisite  on  these 
occasions  is  an  impassive  demeanour.  No  audience  detects 
a  trouble  of  this  kind  so  soon  as  the  singers  themselves,  and 
there  is  always  hope  that  a  little  fertility  of  resource  may 
gloze  over  the  mistake  before  any  one  knows  what  is  going 
on.  But  on  such  occasions,  as  on  all  others,  Ratliff's  face 
was  a  mirror  on  which  the  passing  emotions  of  the  singers 
were  faithfully  and  instantaneously  recorded.  Up  went  the 
eyebrows,  down  went  the  corners  of  the  mouth:  a  hasty 
prod  with  the  left  elbow  into  the  tenor's  ribs  gave  a  sort  of 
general  signal  of  distress,  and  if,  as  was  practically  certain, 
the  eyes  of  all  present  were  fixed  on  him,  it  was  inevitable 
that  the  embarrassment  of  the  singers  should  be  at  once 
revealed.  In  fact,  no  cat  ever  leapt  out  of  any  bag  with 
more  decisive  promptitude.  This  was  something  of  a 
nuisance,  as  it  is  possible,  as  we  have  said,  to  recover  a 
lost  position  in  part-singing,  as  in  chess  or  football.    About 


AN  IMPROVISATORE.  205 

the  year  1876  the  quartette  gave  a  delightful  concert  at 
Eton,  ending  up  with  Bishop's  rollicking  glee,  "  Mynheer 
Van  Dunck."  They  sang  it  unaccompanied,  and  to  suit 
Ratliff's  voice  it  was  raised  two  whole  tones.  Some  of 
our  readers  will  remember  that  near  the  beginning  there 
is  a  bass  solo — 

"  Singing,  oh!  that  a  Dutchman's  draught  could  be 
As  deep  as  the  rolling  Zuyder  Zee;" 

and  on  this  occasion  the  second  bass,  not  being  a  very  old 
hand,  unconsciously  set  off  in  the  original  key,  and  forced 
the  singers  to  continue  the  next  bars  as  they  were  written 
— that  is  to  say,  just  on  the  crack  of  Ratliff's  falsetto. 
The  effect  was  most  disquieting.  He  was  heard  to  emit 
a  series  of  uncomfortable  yappings,  harsh  chest  -  notes 
varied  with  involuntary  falsetto,  so  that  it  was  evident  that 
the  glee  could  not  possibly  be  finished  in  that  way  without 
seriously  tarnishing  the  reputation  of  the  Forester  quartette. 
The  catastrophe  bade  fair  to  spoil  a  jolly  concert  just  when 
it  was  finishing  in  thorough  good  style.  And  there  was 
no  concealing  the  fact :  dismay  and  perplexity  were  seen 
chasing  each  other  from  brow  to  jowl,  up  and  down  the 
leading  singer's  countenance,  and  betraying  themselves  in 
every  movement  of  his  arms,  and  in  something  indescrib- 
able even  in  his  back  view.  Every  portion  of  his  person 
revealed  his  feelings.  But  the  bass,  unlike  Histiaeus, 
having  made  the  shoe,  put  it  on.  When  the  next  bit  of 
solo  came,  "  Water  well  mingled  with  spirit  good  store," 
he  boldly  left  the  notes,  improvised  an  incipient  cadenza, 
and  brought  himself  back  to  within  a  semitone  of  the 
right  pitch.  So  Apollo  saved  us  !  It  was  doubly  delightful 
to  see  the  change  in  our  alto.  Instead  of  threatening  and 
hurrying  clouds  coursing  over  the  sky  of  his  countenance, 
the  broad  ruddy  sun  shone  out  again,  and  off  he  went 
with  "  No  Hollander  dreams  of  scorning,"  easily  subsiding 


2o6  FREE  FORESTER  MUSIC, 

into  the  genial  and  buxom  serenity  required  by  the  words, 
and  which  he  of  all  men  was  best  fitted  to  express. 

Besides  the  specially  comic  part-songs  there  were  some, 
like  the  delightful  Orpheus  glee  "  The  Two  Roses,"  which 
brought  out  a  peculiar  power  of  Ratliff's,  that  of  phrasing. 
The  piece  can  be  easily  sung  so  as  to  produce  no  effect 
whatever  except  that  of  a  mechanical  and  monotonous 
composition.  But  here  the  real  artist  was  at  home.  The 
opening  lines  describing  the  roses  were  given  briskly,  and 
without  the  least  pause  between  the  first  and  second,  as 
if  the  picture  were  too  vivid  not  to  be  eagerly  described  ; 
then  a  slackening  at  "  As  I  pensive,  full  of  care,  gathered 
two  sweet  flowers,"  followed  by  a  pause.  This  was 
suddenly  and  most  effectively  broken  by  the  exhilarat- 
ing appeal,  "  Tell  me,  roses,"  running  at  a  quickened  pace 
in  a  crescendo  up  to  the  high  B  ;  then  again  a  pause,  and 
the  graceful  concluding  phrase  pianissimo.  Any  one  who 
carefully  studies  this  charming  melody  will  see  how  vastly 
it  is  improved  by  these  and  suchlike  little  liberties  with 
the  strict  time,  just  sufficient  to  prevent  all  suspicion  of 
dulness,  while  preserving  the  rhythm. 

In  these  ways  Tom  Ratliff  was  a  prodigious  favourite 
with  many  large  audiences  in  the  Midlands.  On  one  oc- 
casion he  was  applauded  so  long  and  so  loud  on  getting  up 
to  sing  a  solo  that  with  all  his  aplomb  he  was  embarrassed, 
and  hardly  knew  which  way  to  look.  And  the  glamour 
that  he  threw  over  the  old  part-songs  was  so  magical,  that 
it  was  quite  safe  to  draw  up  a  programme  consisting  of 
very  little  else.  We  believe  we  are  right  in  saying  that 
two  charity  concerts  given  in  consecutive  years  at  Newark, 
consisting  of  from  twelve  to  sixteen  part-songs  each,  and 
a  few  unimportant  solos,  yielded  £^y  and  ;^ioo  profit  re- 
spectively. Of  course  this  means  good  local  management. 
But  what  conceivable  management  would  have  yielded  this 
result  unless  the  quartette  had  been  headed  by  Ratliff? 


A  BORN  ARTIST. 


207 


In  short,  he  was  a  born  artist  of  a  most  remarkable  kind. 
His  powers  were  very  insufficiently  trained.  He  was  a  bad 
reader,  and  in  an  echoing  room  a  fine  ear  could  occasion- 
ally detect  him  out  of  tune.  But  making  all  necessary 
subtractions  from  our  encomium,  it  may  safely  be  said 
that  he  was  a  truly  great  part-singer  :  lacking  indeed  some 
of  the  qualifications  of  an  ordinary  choir-singer  of  part- 
songs,  but  gifted  with  a  power,  unparalleled  as  far  as  we 
know  in  any  professional  or  amateur,  of  fascinating  a  large 
audience  by  his  masterly  interpretation  of  ordinary  four- 
part  music,  his  delicate  appreciation  of  the  meaning  of  words 
and  cadences,  and,  above  all,  by  his  irresistible  and  wholly 
indescribable  fun.

THE  FORESTER  BALL. 


By  Edward  Rutter. 


No  chronicles  of  the  Free  Foresters  would  be  complete 
without  some  reference  to  the  Balls  which  have  periodi- 
cally been  given.  What  has  dancing  to  do  with  cricket  ? 
many  will  say,  and  at  the  first  glance  the  two  do  not 
seem  to  be  connected  ;  but  in  a  fraternity  where  social 
gatherings  and  good-fellowship  are  so  closely  allied  to  the 
principal  pastime,  cricket,  dancing  is  constantly  included 
in  the  programme.    As  visitors  in  country-houses  the  F.  F.

are  often  expected,  after  their  arduous  duties  in  the  cricket- 
field,  to  devote  themselves  to  the  ladies,  who  have  looked 
forward  to  the  presence  of  a  cricket  eleven  as  an  excuse 
for  getting  their  neighbours  together  and  having  a  dance 
after  dinner.  And  very  pleasant  evenings  they  are,  and 
though  the  concerts  and  part  -  songs  of  the  inimitable 
quartette  were  at  one  time  highly  and  justly  popular, 
still  upon  the  whole  the  dances  were  quite  as  welcome, 
and  have  survived  the  more  refined  and  artistic  music. 

One  explanation  of  the  constant  popularity  of  Terpsi- 
chore unquestionably  is,  that  the  fairer  sex,  although  they 
may  be  said  to  have  challenged  the  supremacy  of  their 
male  admirers  and  rivals  in  almost  every  department  of 
sporting  or  artistic  excellence,  have  achieved  in  none  of 
them  so  decided  a  supremacy  as  in  the  ball-room.  The 
ladies  who  from  the  outset  condescended  to  wear  Forester 
colours  were  well  advised  of  this,  and  the  earliest  chroni- 
cles of  the  club  record  that  they  made  the  most  of  their 
advantage. 

It  was  with  regard  to  the  inaugural  match  of  Free  For- 
esters that,  in  a  parody  of  Byron  by  one  "  Longfellow " 
(not  the  Transatlantic  poet),  the  proceedings  of  the  even- 
ing were  thus  summed  up — 

"  The  men 
Wore  hearts  like  sieves — all  riddled  through  and  through. 
And  yet,  poor  donkeys,  liked  it :  just  as  when 
Whizz  ! — at  the  blazing  lamp  the  scorched  moth  comes  again." 

And  this  precedent  has  never  been  lost  sight  of  during  the 
intervening  years. 

At  Sutton  Coldfield,  the  birthplace  of  the  Club,  at 
Pype  Hayes,  at  Kingscote,  at  the  Harfords'  at  Knowle 
in  Gloucestershire,  at  the  Greenwoods'  in  Hampshire,  at 
Thornby  and  many  other  houses,  the  Club  has  tripped 
it  merrily.  At  Worcester,  Weybridge,  and  elsewhere,  the 
local  hall  has  been  retained  for  a  ball  given  in  honour 


210  THE  FORESTER  BALL. 

of  the  visitors,  and  at  Deddington  a  dance  in  the  Pavilion 
was  always  an  important  feature  of  the  occasion.  As  time 
went  on  the  Club  began  to  feel  that  some  return  should 
be  made  for  all  this  kindness  and  hospitality,  and  early 
in  1876  it  was  decided  to  give  a  ball,  at  which  our  hosts 
and  hostesses  should  be  our  guests.  A  circular  was  sent 
out,  which  was  very  favourably  received  by  the  members, 
and  accordingly  Willis'  Rooms  were  engaged.  On  the 
second  night  of  the  'Varsity  match  (1876)  the  first  of  these 
pleasant  gatherings  was  inaugurated,  and  to  the  strains 
of  the  Royal  Artillery  band  dancing  was  kept  up  till  the 
morning  sun  shone  brightly  through  the  windows.  It  had 
proved  an  unqualified  success.  Many  wished  it  to  be 
repeated  the  following  year,  but  wiser  counsels  prevailed, 
and  triennial  balls  were  instituted. 

The  ticket  of  invitation,  a  felicitous  piece  of  artistic 
design,  will  be  found  at  the  head  of  this  chapter  ;  and  the 
copy  of  the  first  circular  is  appended,  to  show  how  gener- 
ally the  idea  commended  itself  to  Free  Foresters  of  older 
as  well  as  more  modern  standing : — 

FREE  FORESTER  CRICKET  CLUB. 

At  the  suggestion  of  many  members  of  the  Club,  it  has  been

April  2i^,  1876. 

In  1876,  1879,  1882,  1885,  Willis'  Rooms  were  the  scene 
of  these  festivities  ;  but  in  1888  the  popularity  of  this  resort 
was  on  the  wane,  and  it  shortly  after  disappeared.  The  Club 
was  in  a  dilemma,  when  Philip  H.  Coxe,  an  enthusiastic 
member  of  the  Ball  Committee,  came  forward  and  invited 
them  to  the  "  New  Club,"  then  at  the  height  of  its  short 
but  brilliant  existence.  The  old  "Evans,"  where  supper 
and  song  had  long  prevailed,  had  been  converted  into 
a  luxurious  club-house,  admirably  adapted  for  balls  and 
theatrical  performances,  and  it  was  here  that  the  Free 
Foresters  held  their  most  successful  and  memorable 
reunion. 

Ere  the  next  three  years  had  passed  this  pleasant  resort 
had  come  to  an  untimely  end,  and  the  Club  had  to  look 


212 


THE  M^TROPOLE  HOTEL. 


about  for  fresh  quarters  for  their  ball  in  1891.  The 
Whitehall  Rooms  attached  to  the  Mdtropole  Hotel  sup- 
plied the  existing  want.  In  the  magnificence  and  size 
of  the  rooms  and  in  the  completeness  of  the  arrange- 
ments they  are  unequalled,  and  enabled  the  Free  Fores- 
ters to  entertain  their  friends  right  royally  in  1891 
and  1894. 

The  Club  grows  old  in  years,  but  a  constant  stream 
of  youth  flows  into  it.  And  though  the  fair  daughters 
have  taken  the  place  of  their  fairer  mothers,  and  brave 
sons  the  place  of  braver  fathers,  the  same  pleasant  socia- 
bility and  almost  brotherly  intercourse  prevails  ;  and  as 
every  three  years  come  round  the  Free  Foresters  meet 
together  like  a  large  family  party  to  renew  and  keep  alive 
old  friendships,  to  form  and  strengthen  new.  E.  R.

CHAPTER    XXV. 
1877. 

The  season  of  1877  began  with  a  match  at  Woolwich, 
drawn  on  even  terms,  F.  F.  scoring  114  and  164  to  94 
and  135  for  5  wickets.  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  32  and  49,  G. 
H.  Longman  25  and  21,  bore  the  bell. 

On  May  28  the  favourite  old  haunt  of  Upper  Tooting 
was  revisited,  but  unsuccessfully,  for  S.  Harper  37  and  E. 
Bray  34  helped  a  modest  total  of  114,  which  proved  more 
than  sufficient.  H.  Verelst  23  and  R.  G.  Venables  18 
were  the  only  double  figures  in  the  Forester  score  of  69, 
which  Tooting  equalled  with  6  wickets. 

At  Esher,  on  the  2d  June,  an  uninteresting  match  ended 
in  a  draw.  F.  F.  Sy  and  55 — Esher  39  and  79,  with  2 
wickets  to  fall.     Venables  for  F.  F.  got  44  runs. 

At  Oatlands,  on  June  5,  F.  F.  made  134  to  172  from  the 
Park. 

On  June  6,  however,  F.  F.  obtained  a  score  of  311 
against  Crystal  Palace — T.  S.  Pearson  and  A.  A.  Nepean  56 
each,  H.  M.  Marshall  57,  A.  P.  Lucas  50,  G.  Law  (not  out) 
44.  Two  wickets  of  the  C.  P.  C.  fell  for  11,  when  "  an  awful 
storm  of  wind  and  rain  put  an  end  to  the  proceedings." 

At  Eton,  the  Monday  following,  the  School  scored  129 — 
Ivo  Bligh  42,  from  the  bowling  of  Gilliatt,  6  wickets,  Bray 
3,  and  Chamberlayne  2 — and  then  got  F.  F.  out  for  115 — 
G.  H.  Longman  61. 


214  SCHOOL  MATCHES. 

On  the  appropriate  date  of  June  i8  Free  Foresters 
engaged  Wellington  College  in  a  bloodless  Waterloo.  S. 
G.  Lyttelton  made  37  runs  and  S.  P.  B.  Chamberlayne  25 
out  of  132  for  F.  F.,  and  then  the  same  Foresters  took  the 
Wellington  wickets  (the  latter  6,  the  former  3)  for  53  runs. 
In  a  fragmentary  second  innings  the  School  did  better, 
120  for  5  wickets,  all  claimed  by  Chamberlayne. 

The  Rugby  match  was  played  on  June  18  and  19,  and 
was  won,  after  some  tall  hitting,  by  9  wickets,  the  School 
scoring  116  and  234,  including  50  from  Baily  and  44  (not 
out)  from  Gaddum.  In  Foresters'  first  innings  of  328, 
H.  W.  Gardner  116  was  an  easy  first,  well  supported  by 
A.  S.  Bennett  53,  F.  R.  Evans  45,  and  I.  D.  Walker  37. 
Buchanan  took  12  wickets. 

At  Marlborough,  on  the  20th  and  21st,  the  School 
claimed  203  and  191.  F.  F.  began  with  147 — E.  Hume 
55,  M.  R  Lucas  31 — and  then  made  132  for  6  wickets; 
Dunell  and  Longman  not  out  for  30  and  26. 

At  Shoeburyness,  where  two  innings  filled  up  the  whole 
of  June  29  and  30,  Foresters  began  with  303 — W.  H.  Hay 
71,  G.  Law  78,  F.  Crowder  44,  E.  Rutter  34,  J.  R.  Hutchi- 
son 27,  &amp;c. — but  the  Gunners,  with  137  from  E.  C.  Trollope, 
6Z  (not  out)  from  H.  E.  Walter,  and  sundry  minor  contri- 
butions, exceeded  this  amount  by  62  runs. 

Beddington  Park,  on  the  30th,  was  the  scene  of  a  two- 
to-one  beating,  for  the  Park  made  204,  F.  F.  102,  of  which 
20  were  A.  P.  Lucas's. 

On  July  4  and  5,  at  Southgate,  the  usual  fine  display  of 
batting  came  off.

No  report  is  procurable  of  matches  at  Haileybury,  July 
7;  Shorncliffe  Camp,  July  9  and  10;  Aldershot,  July  11 
and  12. 

On  the  1 6th  and  17th  a  match  at  Hartley  Row,  Hants, 
was  left  unfinished  owing  to  the  rain,  F.  F.  having  com- 
pleted an  innings  of  202 — F.  R.  Twemlow  81,  R.  Garnett 
'^6,  G.  H.  Longman  25.  The  Row  made  180 — Baldwin 
41,  Maturin  (not  out)  30. 

At  Hilsea,  the  two  days  after.  Foresters  drew  again 
with  the  Southern  Division,  scoring  95  and  234  to  169  and 
44  for  3  wickets.  F.  R.  Twemlow  was  again  to  the  fore 
with  23  and  ic6,  R.  Garnett  7  and  (not  out)  33.  Capt. 
Heneage,  R.E.,  with  46  and  20,  was  the  leader  of  the 
opposition. 

On  the  17th  and  i8th  The  Node  made  243  and  won  by 
10  wickets,  G.  F.  Vernon,  54  and  45,  being  the  only  F.  F. 
scorer  of  importance. 

On  the  20th  and  21st  F.  F.  beat  Priory  Park  at  Chiches- 
ter by  6  wickets.  The  Park,  singular  to  say,  just  compiled 
a  century  in  each  innings,  while  F.  F.  got  152  in  their  first, 
G.  E.  Willes  46  and  R.  Garnett  27  doing  best ;  the  latter 


2i6  RUNS  AT  THE  MOTE. 

was  (not  out)  20  in  the  second  innings,  and  W.  H.  Hadow 
(not  out)  22.  Hadow  also  took  12  Chichester  wickets, 
Gilliatt  6. 

A  match  which  had  not  appeared  upon  the  card  was 
played,  July  23  and  24,  at  Sutton  Coldfield,  v.  Gentlemen 
of  Staffordshire,  and  was  drawn,  the  County  scoring  6^ 
and  17  for  3  wickets,  Free  Foresters  51  and  159.  E.  F. 
S.  Tylecote  made  7  and  59,  H.  E.  P.  Steadman  o  and  38 
(not  out),  E.  Flint  18  (not  out)  and  6. 

On  the  same  days,  at  Warnham  Court,  F.  F.  were  defeated 
by  5  wickets.  F.  F.  went  in  first,  and,  with  38  from  Verelst 
and  35  from  F.  Lee,  totalled  130,  a  number  which  the 
home  team  failed  to  reach  by  6  runs — M.  P.  Lucas  (not 
out),  50 ;  but  in  the  second  innings  F.  F.  only  made  68, 
of  which  23  went  to  the  credit  of  J.  R.  Hutchison  (1  b  w), 
consequently,  despite  good  bowling  from  Appleby  (6 
wickets  in  the  first  and  2  in  the  second  innings),  and  two 
or  three  run  out,  the  necessary  runs  were  obtained. 

July  26,  27,  at  Fulbeck.  Col.  Fane's  eleven  made  245 
— G.  H.  Longman  yj',  while  F.  F.  made  94  and  44 — 
Gardner  35,  Tylecote  18. 

On  the  26th  Foresters  encountered  the  Mote,  Maidstone. 
"  Of  the  300  runs  scored  by  F.  F.,  Mr  J.  R.  Hutchison 
contributed  83  (a  six,  7  fours,  3  threes,  8  twos),  Mr  M.  T. 
Martin  50  (8  fours,  5  threes,  and  3  twos),  Mr  F.  Lee  38 
(a  six,  8  fours,  a  three,  and  4  twos),  and  Mr  T.  Ratliff  31 
(4  fours  and  3  twos).  Qn  behalf  of  the  Mote  (134  for  8 
wickets),  Mr  D.  Duncan  scored  54,  comprising  5  fours,  3 
threes,  and  4  twos." 

And  the  two  next  days  F.  F.  obtained  a  victory  at 
Preston  Hall.  The  home  side  went  in  first  and  made 
113,  Lord  Harris  28,  heading  the  score  ;  then  F.  F.  totalled 
291 — S.  G.  Lyttelton  89,  A.  C.  Lucas  31,  J.  H.  Hutchison 
34,  J.  G.  Beevor  29,  R.  Garnett  28,  H.  Verelst  27,  &amp;c.

WALTON.  217 

Duncan  and  Francis  playing  well  for  60  and  67  ;  but  F.  F. 
had  no  difficulty  in  getting  the  43  runs  required  without 
the  loss  of  a  wicket. 

Aug.  I  found  Free  Foresters  at  Walton  again,  for  a  three 
days'  match  with  I  Zingari  and  a  single  day's  contest  with 
Warwickshire.  How  they  fared  the  papers  of  the  day  and 
the  appended  scores  will  show. 

Wednesday  morning  found  two  strong  teams  in  the  field.  I  Z. 
won  the  toss,  and  went  in,  and  began  badly,  Fortescue,  Forbes, 
and  H.  R.  Webbe  all  being  disposed  of  for  small  scores,  4 
wickets  down  for  47,  looking  like  a  one -innings  defeat;  but 
Walter  Hadow,  who  has  so  often  done  the  old  Club  a  good 
turn,  did  not  fail  them  to-day,  and  played  a  magnificent  innings 
of  92  not  out, — worth,  at  least,  120  on  Lord's,  as  the  long  grass 
here  stopped  most  of  the  big  hits.  A.  W.  Ridley  arrived  from 
Canterbury  in  time  for  his  innings,  and  I  Z.  finished  their  innings 
for  206,  Capt.  Stewart  contributing  a  most  useful  16,  including 
two  splendid  square-leg  hits  for  4  each.  Francis  and  Ridley  were 
on  the  spot  in  the  bowling  department,  and  disposed  of  the  strong 
batting  team  opposed  to  them  for  the  small  score  of  114,  Long- 
man playing  well  and  steadily  for  25  runs.  Richardson  was  in 
one  hour  and  three-quarters  for  9  runs,  a  proof  of  the  goodness 
of  the  bowling.  The  Foresters  had  to  follow  on,  and  I  Z.  had  to 
delegate  the  bowling  at  the  commencement  of  the  second  innings 
to  Ridley  and  Middleton,  as  Francis's  side  began  to  be  painful 
again.  Pearson  and  Longman  got  well  set,  and  put  together  120 
before  they  were  separated :  both  played  excellent  cricket,  and 
neither  gave  a  chance.  The  spectators  had,  as  they  say,  "  a  rare 
batting  treat,"  but  whether  I  Z.  looked  upon  it  in  that  light  may 
well  be  doubted.  The  innings  closed  for  206  at  half-past  three 
on  Friday,  leaving  I  Z.  with  1 1 3  to  get  to  win.  Forbes  and 
Webbe  went  in  and  scored  1 1  off  the  first  7  balls,  and  looked 
all  over  like  winning  the  match  without  a  separation  being  ef- 
fected ;  but,  alas !  at  five  o'clock  down  came  the  rain,  and  I  Z. 
were  obliged  to  put  up  with  a  draw  in  their  favour,  instead  of  the 
victory  they  so  fondly  hoped  was  theirs.

On  Saturday  the  Free  Foresters  were  opposed  to  the  County, 
and  easily  headed  them  on  their  first  innings.  Longman  was 
again  in  his  best  form,  and  got  52.  Appleby  was  all  there  with 
the  leather,  and  got  5  wickets,  3  of  them  with  3  consecutive 
balls.  So  ended  the  Walton  week,  and  each  cricketer,  whether 
Zingaro,  Free  Forester,  or  County  Warwick,  left  the  ground  with 
the  deepest  feelings  of  gratitude  to  Sir  Charles  Mordaunt  for  the 
week's  pleasure  he  had  afforded  them.  May  the  house  of 
Mordaunt  long  flourish,  and  may  we  all  meet  there  again  in 
1878  and  fight  our  friendly  battles  once  more!

The  score  of  the  two  next  days  at  Hanbury  I  have  been 
unable  to  discover. 

At  the  annual  general  meeting  of  the  Rugby  Cricket 
Club  in  March  of  this  year,  the  use  of  the  ground  was 


220 


THE  ROVERS. 


granted  for  the  match  F.  F.  v.  Uppingham  Rovers,  to  be 
played  in  the  following  August.  The  match  came  in  due 
course  on  the  13th  and  14th,  and  the  Foresters,  not  being 
so  strongly  represented  as  they  should  have  been,  and  with 
the  luck  against  them,  were  easily  beaten.  The  record 
says : — 

This  match  was  played  at  Rugby  on  Aug.  13  and  14,  and 
commenced  the  northern  tour  of  the  Rovers,  who  won  easily  in 
one  innings  with  2 1  runs  to  spare.  Messrs  Street,  Schultz,  Steel 
(D.  Q.),  and  Green  (C.  E.  Green  20,  and  Rev.  J.  H.  Green  30) 
were  most  successful  with  the  bat;  whilst  for  the  Foresters,  Messrs 
Longman  and  Marshall  played  splendid  cricket  in  the  second 
innings.  D.  Buchanan  and  S.  S.  Schultz  both  bowled  well  for 
their  respective  sides.  George  Longman,  of  the  great  publishing 
firm,  a  thorough  cricketer,  and  Herbert  Marshall  were  unfor- 
tunate in  their  first  venture  with  the  bat.  Schultz  bowled 
splendidly.

On  the  1 6th  and  17th,  at  Deddington,  F.  F.  reached  the 
respectable  score  of  257,  thanks  to  74  from  G.  Law,  30 
from  F.  Lee,  27  from  T.  Ratliff,  29  from  F.  R.  Price,  and 
divers  minor  contributions  ;  then  an  eleven  which  looked 
more  than  respectable  on  paper  crumbled  before  Buchanan 
(12  wickets)  and  Bray  (7)  for  33  and  48  runs. 

At  Shrewsbury,  Aug.  21  and  22,  Shropshire  scored  192 
against  Free  Foresters'  177,  R.  Lyttelton  83,  and  84  for  4 
wickets — F.  R.  Twemlow  44,  S.  G.  Lyttelton  28.  Rutter 
took  5  v/ickets. 

On  the  24th  and  25th  at  Kingscote  a  match  was  drawn, 
which  must  have  been  a  good  deal  interrupted  by  bad 
weather,  for  F.  F.  only  got  165 — E.  M.  Wakeman  28,  S. 
G.  Lyttelton  21,  E.  Rutter  19,  &amp;c. — and  the  home  side  100 
less,  and  no  second  innings  seems  to  have  been  attempted.

41  runs,  J.  M.  Yates  22.

Forbes  each  disposed  of  7  wickets. 

At  the  Node  the  F.  F.  had  a  good  team  but  were  easily

is  not  forthcoming. 

At  Henley,  on  the  6th  July,  F.  F.  made  234  to  the

Bray  45. 

The  twelve-a-side  match  with  Rugby  School  on  the  8th 
and  9th  of  July,  fortunately  for  F.  F.,  ended  in  a  draw,  the 
boys  being  only  31  runs  behind,  with  6  wickets  to  fall.

H.  G.  S.  Hughes  19  and  45.  The  County,  5  of  whose 
wickets  fell  to  James  Alston,  would  have  cut  a  bad  figure, 
but  for  a  good  not-out  41  from  W.  W.  Bagot,  who  also 
took  7  F.  F.  wickets. 

On  the  22d  and  23d,  at  Deddington,  F.  F.  made  loi  ;

modest  scorers  for  F.  F.

CHAPTER    XXVIII. 


1880. 


The  season  began  on  May  31  at  Woolwich,  when  a  wet 
first  day  spoiled  the  match  with  Royal  Artillery,  who 
on  the  1st  June  scored  121  to  the  188  of  F.  F. — J.  S. 
Russel  j6,  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  33.  Bovill  took  4  and  G. 
Law  3  wickets. 

On  the  4th  June  the  scene  of  action  was  Wellington,  but 
no  gazette  appears  to  have  been  published. 

At  Upper  Tooting  on  the  7th  F.  F.  got  154,  Schultz,  Z^  ; 
and  then  Schultz  (8  wickets),  Goldney  (3),  and  Gilliatt  (2), 
got  Tooting  down  for  132. 

On  the  nth  and  12th  the  match  at  Chatham,  after  a 
close  first  innings,  proved  an  easy  victory  for  R.E.

At  Rugby,  on  17th  and  i8th  June,  the  Foresters,  who 
had  not  won  since  1877,  were  defeated  by  59  runs,  F.  F. 
making  80  and  114  against  125  and  128  by  the  School. 
H.  G.  S.  Hughes  made  18  and  4,  G.  S.  Marriott  7  and  13, 
C.  M.  CunHffe  12  and  23,  H.  W.  Gardner  12  and  40,  Rev. 
O.  Mordaunt  o  and  13,  H.  Rotherham  (not  out)  13  and  I, 
Buchanan  10  and  (not  out)  o.  For  the  School  W.  P.  Ward 
made  28  and  11,  A.  L.  Melly  29  and  i,  C.  E.  Cobb  27  and 

4,  E.  H.  Kempson  24  and  2,  E.  N.  Fellowes  o  and  (not  out) 
39.  In  the  match  Buchanan  took  8,  Rotherham  7,  Marriott 
4  wickets,  and  Mordaunt  i.  "  It  was  thought  that  the  bowl- 
ing talent  of  the  Free  Foresters  would  more  than  compen- 
sate for  their  deficiencies  in  batting,  that  department  of  the 
game  never  having  been  better  represented  ;  the  victory  of 
the  School  was  therefore  a  well-earned  one." 

On  the  19th  June,  at  Henley,  the  natives  obtained  159 — 
W.  J.  Hughes  46 — and  F.  F.  only  107 — B.  N.  Acroyd  37, 
H.  E.  Speed  30.     W.  D.  Bovill  took  9  Forester  wickets. 

On  the  22d  and  23d  time  and  rain  prevented  the  con- 
summation of  a  one-innings  victory  over  R.M.A.  at  Wool- 
wich, F.  F.  scoring  351,  A.  F.  Jeffreys  loi  (not  out)  and  J. 

5.  Russel  105  being  the  chief  contributors,  F.  G.  Street 
assisting  with   34,  W.  F.   Higgins   25,  W.  Byass   24,   D. 


234  THE  SHUTERS. 

Moffatt  27.  The  R.M.A.  made  121  and  loi  for  8 
wickets,  Rutter  taking  7,  Byass  and  Higgins  each  5  of 
their  wickets. 

At  Shoeburyness,  on  the  25th  and  26th,  another  un- 
finished match  in  favour  of  F.  F.  took  place  with  the 
School  of  Gunnery,  F.  F.  scoring  136  and  256,  H.  Gilliatt 
claiming  14  and  74,  Colonel  Kington  8  and  71,  A.  F. 
Jeffreys  o  and  44,  T.  Wise  27  and  17,  Capt.  B.  Baker  25 
(not  out)  and  3.  Of  the  Gunners,  whose  totals  were  10 1 
and  40  for  4  wickets,  E.  Rutter  accounted  for  9. 

On  the  30th,  at  Chiselhurst,  West  Kent  scored  234  runs 
— the  Shuter  brothers  making  56  and  75  of  them — and 
then  F.  F.  ha4  to  retii*e  for  127,  G.  F.  Vernon  claiming  39, 
C.  M.  Cunliffe  25,  G.  Law  21.  Two  wickets  were  down  in 
the  second  innings  for  27 — Vernon  (not  out)  19. 

On  July  I,  F.  F.  scored  232  against  Eton,  who  made  56 
and  5  3  for  two  wickets.  H.  W.  Gardner  5  5,  W.  F.  Forbes  54, 
J.  G.  Crowdy  51,  E.  Lyttelton  33,  were  the  best  performers 
for  F.  F.  with  the  bat ;  Goldney  9,  and  Bray  3  wickets,  with 
the  ball. 

On  the  7th,  at  Oatlands  Park,  having  got  the  home  side 
out  for  y^,  F.  F.  made  127,  including  33  from  D.  Moffatt,  25 
from  A.  H.  Trevor,  21  from  M.  G.  Wilkinson,  and  13  (not 
out)  from  C.  Y.  Bedford.  S.  Lyttelton,  G.  Law,  and  H. 
AUsopp  were  the  bowlers. 

The  1 2th  and  13th  found  F.  F.  opposed  to  Capt.  Bridge's 
eleven,  who  scored  157  and  25  for  3  wickets,  while  F.  F. 
had  one  innings  for  100 — W.  Lucy  26,  their  best  man.  S. 
Garnett  took  8  wickets,  Law  4. 

And  on  the  two  next  days  at  Knole  Park,  playing  thir- 
teen a-side,  the  Park  made  250,  F.  F.  207  for  10  wickets — 
E.  Hanbury  89,  H.  G.  S.  Hughes  38.  Gilliatt  took  5  and 
J.  Marsham  4  wickets  of  the  Park,  for  whom  E.  M.  Grace 
made  89  runs. 

At  Warnham  Court  the  week  was  concluded  by  a  one-

innings  defeat,  F.  F.  making  138  and  102,  the  Courtiers 
372.  E.  Hanbury  was  best  again  for  the  F.  F.  with  28 
and  54  (not  out),  C.  W.  Bulpett  48  and  3,  W.  D.  Bovill  20 
and  o.  For  Warnham  (whose  wickets  were  equally  divided 
between  Godfray,  Bulpett,  and  Bovill),  three  of  the  Lucas 
family  did  the  mischief— A.  P.  83,  A.  C.  72,  E.  M.  64. 

On  July  19  and  20,  at  Aldershot,  Free  Foresters  made 
two  innings,  T13  and  106  for  6  wickets,  against  one  of  205 
for  the  Camp.  H.  J.  B.  Rollings  55  and  33,  both  not  out, 
did  best. 

But  on  the  following  days  the  Club  mended  their  hand 
considerably,  scoring  260  to  103  and  36  for  2  wickets  from 
the  Garrison  at  Winchester.  Capt.  Borrowes  made  70,  C. 
Booth  48,  E.  Hanbury  46,  A.  Jeffreys  35.  Rutter  took  9 
wickets. 

At  Preston  Hall,  July  26  and  27,  the  match  was  drawn, 
Mr  Brassey's  eleven  scoring  157  and  159  (Ivo  Bligh  26  and 
63)  to  F.  F.'s  153  and  52  for  i  wicket — V.  Royle  17  and  20 
(not  out),  E.  Bray  14  and  22  (twice  not  out),  T.  S.  Pearson 
30,  and  H.  G.  Tyiecote  20,  doing  best.  Appleby  took  1 1 
and  H.  G.  Tyiecote  6  wickets. 

Of  the  match  against  Malvern,  July  28  and  29,  no  record 
appears  in  the  M.  C.  C.  C.  book. 

Worcestershire  beat  F.  F.  at  the  Boughton  ground  on 
Aug.  5  and  6.  The  totals  of  F.  F.  were  90  and  iii,  while 
the  County,  who  scored  177  in  their  first  essay,  rubbed  off 
the  balance  without  losing  a  wicket :  no  individual  Forester 
reached  20  runs. 

At  Edgbaston,  Birmingham,  on  Aug.  9  and  10,  the  match 
was  drawn.  F.  F.  scored  141  and  131 — C.  W.  Rawlinson 
57  and  10,  E.  Hanbury  35  and  36.  Edgbaston  in  their  first 
innings  made  138,  and  49  for  4  wickets  in  the  second.  A. 
Smith,  45  and  15,  was  their  best  man.  Bovill  took  7  of 
their  wickets. 

The  match  with  Staffordshire  at  Sutton  Coldfield  on  the 


236  LOSSES. 

nth  and  1 2th  was  also  drawn  in  an  interesting  position. 
One  run  was  the  lead  obtained  by  the  County,  i6o  to  159, 
in  the  first  innings.     E.  Alcock,  58.  best  for  the  Shire,  and 

E.  Hanbury,  42,  for  the  Club.  Then  Staffordshire  fell  for 
123  (Alcock  again  41),  and  time  prevented  more  play. 

At  Wellesbourne,  two  days  later,  a  couple  of  missed 
catches  earned  Mr  Bachelor  a  long  innings,  and  F.  F.  a 
defeat.  Wellesbourne  made  173  and  F.  F.  only  84;  so 
they  had  to  follow,  and  got  107 — E.  Hanbury  15  and  20, 

F.  H.  Lee  8  and  28,  S.  C.  Voules  8  and  18,  G.  S.  Hughes 
17  and  8,  W.  D.  Bovill  19  and  o.  Then  South  Warwick- 
shire knocked  off  the  runs  with  the  loss  of  2  wickets. 

On  the  20th  and  21st,  at  Shrewsbury,  the  F.  F.  brought 
to  an  appropriate  close  an  anything  but  brilliant  campaign ; 
for  Shropshire,  with  the  assistance  of  164  from  C.  F.  Leslie, 
81  from  E.  Wakeman,  70  from  Payne,  and  69  from  Gillies, 
compiled  (in  spite  of  the  attacks  of  Cobden,  Lucas,  Gibbon, 
and  other  noted  bowlers)  an  innings  of  483,  and  then  got 
F.  F.  out  for  85  and  82  for  3  wickets,  A.  H.  Heath,  35,  sav- 
ing the  credit  of  his  side. 

On  the  23d  and  24th  a  match  at  Deddington,  of  which 
the  full  score  will  be  found  in  a  later  page,  was  won  by  the 
home  side.

CHAPTER    XXIX. 

1881. 

The  programme  began  this  year  with  a  match  at  Esher, 
May  21,  of  which  the  score  is  not  forthcoming. 

On  the  30th  May  the  R.M.A.  at  Woolwich  opposed  118 
runs  to  Foresters'  192.  Capt.  Beresford  Baker  made  54, 
E.  Rutter  39,  A.  F.  Jeffreys  26,  A.  Chambers  12  (not  out). 
Goldney  took  6  wickets,  Rutter  3. 

R.A.,  on  June  6  and  7,  after  F.  F.  had  scored  228,  made 
166,  and  got  7  F.  F.  wickets  for  124.  In  Free  Foresters' 
first  innings  the  principal  scores  were  those  of  Capt.  Pear- 
son 72  (not  out),  E.  Hanbury  28,  S.  G.  Wilson  52,  and  E. 
Rutter  18.  Rutter  also  took  4  wickets.  In  the  second 
innings  A.  Jeffreys  36  (not  out)  and  F.  H.  Lee  26  did 
best. 

On  the  next  day,  at  Chiselhurst,  the  spell  was  reversed, 
West  Kent  claiming  223  to  Foresters'  106,  of  which  Lord 
Carnegie  made  33,  C.  Booth  28. 

On  the  9th  F.  F.  played  nth  Hussars  at  Hounslow. 

A  match  against  Longwood  ended  in  a  draw  in  favour 
of  the  home  side,  who  got  169  and  217  to  84  and  88  for  6 
wickets.  J.  G.  Crowdy  o  and  44,  G.  H.  Goldney  45  and  3, 
did  best  for  F.  F. 

At  Chatham,  on  the  loth  and  nth,  only  five  Free 
Foresters  put  in  an  appearance,  who  with  the  assistance 
of  emergencies   contrived   to   score    35    and    139  —  J.    S. 


238  EMERGENCIES. 

Russel  19  and  16,  A.  F.  Jeffreys  o  and  25,  R.  O.  Milne 
48.  R.E.  therefore,  having  made  127  in  their  first  hands, 
rubbed  off  the  balance  without  losing  a  wicket.  Capron 
accounted  for  6  and  R.  E.  Milne  for  4  wickets. 

A  twelve-a-side  match  with  Eton,  June  11,  ended  in  a 
draw,  Eton  scoring  185,  F.  F.  151  for  9  wickets — T.  S. 
Pearson  46,  the  best  score.  G.  Law  took  5  Eton  wickets 
and  made  19  runs. 

At  Elstree,  on  the  15th  and  i6th,  F.  F.  just  managed  to 
stave  off  a  defeat  in  one  innings,  making  136  and  187  for 
9  wickets  to  330  from  Elstree,  whose  chief  batsmen  were 

E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  100,  Breedon  71  (not  out).     For  Foresters 

F.  R.  E.  Fryer  made  o  and  75,  Capt.  B.  Baker  27  and  27, 
F.  W.  Capron  18  and  2,  C.  F.  Hoare  18  and  o,  E.  Rutter 
17  and  6  (not  out).     Fryer  got  5  wickets. 

The  School  of  Gunnery  at  Shoeburyness,  on  June  24 
and  25,  had  two  innings  of  145  and  149  to  one  of  For- 
esters, which  totalled  161.  E.  Rutter  scored  35,  Capt.  Baker 
29,  T.  O.  Reay  22  for  F.  F.  Goldney  and  Rutter  got  8 
wickets  apiece. 

F.  F.  encountered  Clifton  College  on  the  1st  and  2d 
July,  and  seem  to  have  been  rather  fortunate  in  their 
emergencies.  They  scored  334  in  their  first  innings,  of 
which  H.  F.  Fox  made  137,  A.  D.  Greene  64,  P.  W.  H. 
Miles  51.  The  College  then  made  228  and  182,  and  F.  F. 
52  for  4  wickets.     Gilliatt  took  5  wickets. 

At  Henley,  on  the  2d,  the  home  side  reached  the  total 
of  328,  and  then  F.  F.  made  128  for  3  wickets — A.  H. 
Trevor  58  (not  out). 

On  July  4  and  5,  against  Capt.  Bridge's  eleven,  the  Blaise 
Castle  team  made  ZZ  and  100  to  Foresters'  35  and  91, 
A.  H.  Evans  reckoning  7  and  24  and  10  wickets,  Gilliatt 
6  wickets. 

And  on  the  6th,  at  Knole  Park,  254  was  the  score  against 
which  F.   F.  had  to  go  in,  and  they  only  succeeded  in 


WEATHER  BAD.  239 

rubbing  off  151— E.  Hanbury  51,  A.  F.  Jeffreys  35,  being 
the  best  performers.     Evans  claimed  4  wickets,  Rutter  3. 

On  the  nth  and  12th  of  July,  at  Rugby,  "a  strong  team 
of  F.  F.  made  the  star  of  the  Wanderers  rise  with  a  bound, 
as  the  School  team  was  beaten  by  150  runs,  F.  F.  making 
157  and  262  and  the  School  163  and  2&gt;6,  T.  S.  Pearson 
made  28  and  40,  W.  R  Ward  (of  last  year's  School  eleven) 

10  and  32,  J.  D.  Walker  23  and  19,  A.  J.  Webbe  10  and 
82,  Capt.  Beresford  Baker  39  and  13,  C.  Smith  (Clary) 
21  in  the  first,  C.  J.  Inglis  and  H.  G.  S.  Hughes  16  and  31 
respectively  in  the  second,  and  Buchanan  not  out  in  both 
innings.  The  School  wickets  were  disposed  of  as  follows  : 
Buchanan  6  and  3,  Walker  i  and  5,  Webbe  2,  Inglis  2, 
and  Ward  i.  The  loss  of  the  services  of  Arnall,  the  slow 
bowler,  early  in  the  match,  from  an  injury  to  his  foot, 
considerably  lessened  any  chance  of  winning  on  the  part 
of  the  School." 

The  match  with  King  Edward's  School,  Oxford,  on  the 
13th,  was  not  played  from  stress  of  weather. 

On  July  18  and  19,  at  Warnham  Court,  F.  F.  realised 
151  and  146,  the  Court  155  and  48  for  4  wickets — C.  W.  M. 
Bulpett  62  and  14,  A.  O.  Burton  35  and  o,  F.  H.  Lee  o 
and  33,  R.  M.  Turnbull  7  and  27  :  he  also  took  6  wickets. 

On  the  22d  and  23d,  at  St  Cross,  Winchester,  the  Rifle 
Depot,  after  F.  F.  had  scored  238,  made  no  and  328,  F.  F. 
in  the  second  innings  having  lost  i  wicket  for  10  runs. 
A.  F.  Jeffreys  89,  and  Beresford  Baker  86  (not  out), 
were  the  heroes  of  the  Forester  score.     C.  K.  Wood  took 

11  wickets. 

At  Broughton,  Worcester,  on  the  ist  and  2d  Aug.,  F.  F. 
encountered  the  Gentlemen  of  Worcestershire,  and  won  by 
24  runs.

At  Hams  Hall,  on  the  6th  Aug.,  nine  of  the  F.  F.  made 
59,  and  got  out  Edgbaston  for  257. 

On  the  8th  and  9th,  in  very  rainy  weather,  they  drew 
with  Staffordshire  Gentlemen  at  Lichfield  ;  the  County 
making  162 — H.  Bagot  30,  C.  H.  Gardner  2i^ — ¥.  F.  203 
(Bovill  94  not  out — he  scored  8  not  out  in  second  innings) 
and  65  for  4  wickets.  And  on  the  loth  and  nth  Welles- 
bourne  came  over  to  play  them  at  Sutton  Coldfield,  but 
as  it  rained  both  days  from  dawn  to  eve,  not  a  single  ball 
was  bowled  ! 

Rain  again  ruined  the  match  at  Middleton  Towers 
against  Mr  Jervis's  eleven  on  the  same  day,  though  one 


A   CURIOUS   UMPIRE.  241 

innings  each  was  finished.  The  home  side  scored  120, 
and  F.  F.  148 — J.  Marsham  30,  the  highest  single  score. 
Tillard  secured  6  wickets,  R.  Lyttelton  4. 

At  Melton  Constable,  Aug.  15  and  i6(?),  Free  Foresters 
lost  to  Lord  Hastings'  eleven,  making  64  and  170,  to  198 
and  41  for  no  wickets — C.  Tillard  o  and  65,  R.  H.  Lyttel- 
ton 4  and  37.  An  amusing  incident  happened  during  the 
Melton  Constable  innings.  Dale  was  fielding  at  long-leg. 
Thornton  hit  the  ball  straight  to  him.  Dale  never  thought 
the  batsman  would  try  to  get  a  second  run,  but  Thornton 
did  not  like  the  idea  of  giving  up  the  bowling,  so  started 
on  the  return  journey.  This  roused  Dale,  who  dashed 
at  the  ball  with  all  his  old  Cambridge  energy  and  sent 
it  in  like  lightning,  and  ran  Thornton  out  by  about  two 
yards.  He,  not  liking  to  die  without  a  struggle,  said, 
**  How's  that,  umpire  ?  "  —  the  umpires  were  two  local 
brethren.  "  Not  out,"  said  that  worthy.  The  field  were  all 
not  a  little  astonished,  and  Dale  furious  after  his  fine  piece 
of  fielding.  The  brother  umpire,  who  saw  the  whole  affair, 
went  to  talk  to  his  brother  after  the  fall  of  the  next  wicket, 
when  he  confided  to  him  that  he  had  often  heard  of  the 
^*  great  hitter,"  but  had  never  seen  him  before,  and  there- 
fore wanted  to  see  what  he  could  do. 

At  Deddington,  on  the  15th  and  i6th,  F.  F.  scored  214 
— G.  H.  Longman  65,  H.  W.  Hoare  40,  A.  O.  Burton  25. 
Deddington  scored  87  and  177  for  5  wickets — H.  Tubb 
I  and  (not  out)  100,  Clary  Smith  26  and  20. 

The  Aldershot  Division  on  the  24th  were  to  have  met 
F.  F.,  but  there  is  no  record  of  their  having  done  so.

CHAPTER    XXX. 

1882. 

The  season  commenced  with  a  capital  match  at  Esher  on 
May  27,  the  last  wicket  of  F.  F. — G.  H.  Goldney — when 
only  6  runs  were  required  to  win,  being  finely  caught  by 
W.  Bovill,  fielding  as  a  substitute  for  Esher.  Scores — 
F.  F.  164,  Esher  169. 

On  the  29th  and  30th  of  the  same  month,  F.  F.  at 
Woolwich  scored  159  and  225  against  the  R.A.,  who 
made  123  and  153.  This  was  a  most  extraordinary 
match.  R.A.  went  in  the  second  time  for  262  to  win, 
and  lost  9  wickets  for  33  runs;  then  Purvis  (31)  and 
Dorehill  (85)  got  together  and  played  out  time.  The 
chief  display  of  batting  for  F.  F.  was  made  by  F.  E.

Trevor  20.     Goldney  and  Bray  each  annexed  5  wickets. 

Wet  spoiled  the  match  v.  Elstree  Masters  on  June  9,

W^ebbe  25  and  o,  F.  L.  Evelyn  4  and  21.  Buchanan  took

wickets,  drawing  the  match. 

On  the  same  day,  at  Eton,  the  Royal  School  made  225,

&amp;c. — to  316  from  the  Gunners,  for  whom  Lieut.  Hewson

F.  F.  was  bowled,  and  only  one  S.  of  G.  was  caught. 

July  I,  at  Hounslow,  v.  nth  Hussars.  No  score  ob- 
tainable. 

Long  innings  and  a  wet  day  brought  the  match  at 
Clifton  to  a  draw  on  July  3  and  4.  One  innings  on  each 
side  was  completed — F.  F.  221,  and  the  College  210. 

On  the  5th,  V.  Capt.  Bridge's  eleven  (Knole  Park)  at 
Blaise  Castle,  F.  F.  won  easily  in  an  innings  by  24  runs, 
F.  F.  making  95 — R.  C.  Ramsay  47 — and  then  getting 
out  the  home  eleven  for  45  and  26.  Ramsay  10  wickets, 
Peake  4,  and  Gilliatt  2.

Peter's  College,  F.  F.  making  100,  R.  S.  W.  131  and  48 
for  4  wickets  in  second  innings.  P.  Toynbee  40,  and  C. 
Y.  Bedford  23,  scored  best  for  F.  F.  H.  F.  Chance  took 
8  wickets. 

Of  a  match  on  July  17,  v.  Winchester  Garrison,  no  score

F.  F.  lost  by  7  wickets,  scoring  138  and  138 — A.  H. 
Trevor  50  and  11,  J.  Eyre  i  and  65 — against  212  in  the 
first  innings  of  Longwood,  of  which  A.  H.  Wood  made  6Z 
and  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  i  run  less. 

On  July  24,  and  the  two  next  days,  an  interesting 
match  was  played  with  Liverpool,  who  went  in  first,  and 
from  the  bowling  of  Appleby  and  Stewart  Garnett  made 
135 — Lyster  59,  their  best  single  score.  Then  F.  F.  replied 
with  162— Major  Miles  57,  A.  Appleby  39,  and  C.  W. 
Bulpett  25,  doing  best.  The  second  innings  of  Liverpool 
produced  139,  Appleby  again  taking  5  wickets;  and  as 
F.  F.  lost  8  wickets  for  ^9  runs,  the  match  was  drawn, 
presumably  in  favour  of  the  city. 

On  July  28  and  29,  at  St  David's,  Reigate,  F.  F.  drew 
a  match  with  W.  H.  Churchill's  eleven.  F.  F.  achieved

CHAPTER    XXXI. 

1883. 

With  this  year  the  task  of  the  compiler  comes  to  an  end, 
and  a  more  facile  and  familiar  pen  will  chronicle  the  re- 
maining years  in  up-to-date  fashion.  Thanks  are  tendered, 
as  honestly  due,  to  the  many  Foresters  who  have  kindly 
contributed  items  q(  information,  and  helped  to  make  the 
narrative  as  perfect  as  the  capacity  of  the  writer  would 
admit  of. 

The  season  began  with  a  match  at  Woolwich  v.  R.A. 
on  the  14th  and  15th  May,  which  was  lost,  R.A.  making 
113  and  155  to  54  and  123  from  F.  F.  E.  M.  Bannerman 
26  and  12,  F.  H.  Mellor  2  and  39,  W.  F.  Capron  o  and  48, 
batted  well  for  F.  F.,  and  C.  R.  Wood  took  8  wickets,  R. 
M.  Turnbull  7. 

The  match  at  Esher  on  May  26  was  spoiled  by  rain. 

On  June  6  F.  F.  lost  to  Elstree  Masters,  who  got  138  to 
F.  F.  117,  though  as  Cattley  and  Kenrick  were  (not  out) 
47  and  45  respectively  in  their  second  innings,  the  pros- 
pect had  brightened  considerably.  E.  F.  S.  Tylecote  also 
claimed  23  runs  and  J.  Robertson  5  wickets. 

On  June  9,  at  Crookham,  the  Moors  scored  90  to 
F.  F.  123.  Maul  31,  Turnbull  25,  Oswald  21,  Brougham 
22,  were  the  F.  F.  champions.  Lang  took  5  wickets, 
Goldney  4. 

At  Eton,  on  the  i6th  June,  the  home  side  made  143  to 


248  DRA  WS. 

F.  F.  159.  E.  Lyttelton  57,  J.  W.  Dale  56,  were  best  with 
the  bat  for  Foresters,  and  Goldney  took  8  wickets  for  84 
runs  ;  Richards  for  Eton  took  7  for  40. 

The  match  at  Oatlands  Park,  June  20  and  21,  was

The  match  at  Shoeburyness,  on  June  23  and  24,  against 
the  School  of  Gunnery  was  also  drawn,  F.  F.  scoring  148 
and  227,  the  Gunners  89  and  jy  for  4  wickets.  F.  E.

last-named  also  took  4  wickets  and  Goldney  as  many. 

At  Rugby,  on  the  9th  and  loth,  after  getting  the  School 
out  for  58  runs,  F.  F.  made  172,  and  though  the  boys 
improved  in  the  second  essay,  scoring  154,  it  only  cost 
Foresters  3  wickets  to  win  the  match.  A.  J.  Webbe  41 
and  19  (not  out)  was  their  premier  batsman.  Robertson 
and  Buchanan  took  12  and  4  wickets  respectively.

21,  W.  R.  Peyton  12  and  25.  W.  C.  R.  Bedford  and  C. 
Armstrong  each  took  4  wickets. 

The  match  at  Longwood  v.  Lord  Northesk's  eleven,  on 
July  II  and  12,  was  drawn.  F.  F.  120 — G.  H.  Goldney 
(not  out)  46;  Longwood  132 — A.  F.  Jeffreys  30,  F.  E. 
Lacey  36.

At  Manchester,  Western,  on  the  20th  and  2ist,  the 
match  was  drawn.  After  F.  R,  who  went  in  first,  had 
lost  4  wickets  for  226  —  C.  R.  Seymour  113,  J.  E.  K. 
Studd  40,  G.  Bird  (not  out)  56 — rain  prevented  further 
play. 

On  July  23  and  24  F.  F.  lost  at  Abbots  Langley,  the 
home  team  claiming  138  and  153  to  F.  F.  79  and  129. 
F.  E.  Allsopp  made  two  innings  of  18  and  21,  Capt.  Renny 
Tailyour  4  and  36.  The  latter,  with  Rutter,  Baker,  and 
Allsopp,  dismissed  four  batsmen  apiece. 

On  July  25  and  26  F.  F.  lost  to  East  Gloucestershire  at

Cheltenham.  The  Club  made  the  paltry  total  of  29  runs, 
and  though  they  mended  their  second  essay  to  173 — C. 
Smith  13  and  105,  J.  S.  Russell  9  and  19 — yet  the  county 
gentlemen,  who  had  got  112,  just  managed  to  secure  the 
needful  91  with  i  wicket  to  fall. 

On  Aug.  3  and  4,  at  Reigate,  F.  F.  lost  to  Mr  Churchill's 
team. 

On  Aug.  7  and  8,  at  Hitchin,  the  Gentlemen  of  Herts 
just  saved  themselves  from  a  defeat  in  one  innings,  getting 
143  and  47  for  7  wickets  to  253  from  F.  F.,  H.  G.  S. 
Hughes  making  yj  and  F.  W.  Maude  33  of  them,  G.  H. 
Goldney  27  and  G.  Macan  21.  Beresford  Baker  took  10 
wickets. 

At  Middleton  Towers,  on  Aug.  15,  16,  the  match  was 
drawn  in  favour  of  the  Towers,  who  scored  358 — Capt. 
Frederick  "jy,  A.  F.  Kemp  58,  A.  B.  Giles  56,  &amp;c.— to  164 
from  F.  F.,  who  had  made  132  for  5  wickets  in  the  follow 
— H.  G.  S.  Hughes  17  and  59  (not  out),  E.  H.  Buckland 
16  and  15. 

On  the  two  following  days  Norfolk  County  won  a  most 
exciting  match  by  i  wicket.  Buckland  played  splendidly 
for  104,  and  Maude  bowled  7  wickets  for  44.

20  and  21  at  Lord  Jersey's,  Middleton  Hall,  Bicester, 
where  the  home  side  made  258 — J.  G.  Walker  65,  F.  W. 
Maude  57,  H.  Tubb  33 — to  the  Foresters'  73  ;  and  though 
the  latter  then  made  202 — W.  D.  Bovill  5  and  41,  A.  H. 
Trevor  5  and  43,  G.  Willes  8  and  31,  T.  T.  Peyton  21  and

CHAPTER     XXXII. 

R.E.   MATCHES. 

By  W.  E.  W.  Collins. 

In  this  attempt  to  carry  out  the  work  entrusted  to  me  by 
my  superior  officers,  the  Rev.  W.  Bedford,  the  father,  and 
Edward  Rutter,  whom  I  may  call  the  pedagogue,  of  the 
Free  Forester  Club,  I  am  fully  conscious  of  the  delicate 
nature  of  my  task — the  task,  that  is,  of  at  once  writing 
of  and  writing  to  living  contemporaries.  In  a  record  of 
this  sort  it  is  almost  impossible  to  avoid  personalities.  If 
any  cricket  friend  or  cricket  foe  is  inclined  to  feel  aggrieved 
by  any  word  of  mine,  I  would  ask  him  to  remember  that 

"  Many  a  shaft,  at  random  sent, 
Finds  mark  the  archer  little  meant ! " 

and  to  acquit  me  of  any  intention  to  offend.  How  far  my 
memory  of  incidents  and  my  opinions  on  the  game  may 
differ  from  those  of  others  is  perhaps  a  matter  of  little 
moment.  If  any  other  Forester  would  have  undertaken 
these  chapters  in  my  stead,  he  would  have  earned  my 
eternal  gratitude.  Let  me,  then,  without  further  apology, 
try  in  some  degree  to  merit  his  approval. 

In  the  first  place,  then,  I  do  not  think  that  I  need 
apologise  to  Edward  Rutter  for  the  sobriquet  I  have 
bestowed  on  him.  To  him  it  has  been  a  labour  of  love 
to   guide   almost    from   its    earliest  infancy  the  tottering 


CHATHAM,  253 

footsteps  of  this  now  middle-aged  Club,  to  steer  it  clear 
of  all  the  pitfalls  and  stumbling-blocks  which  must  occa- 
sionally imperil  the  existence  of  the  strictly  amateur  C.C. ; 
to  keep  it  from  taking  false  steps,  to  open  out  for  it  roads 
to  new  and  happy  hunting-grounds,  and  finally  to  win 
from  every  member  with  whom  he  has  come  into  con- 
tact that  sort  of  affectionate  regard  and  respect  which 
we  may  fancy  a  Roman  boy  felt  towards  his  pedagogue, 
the  companion  of  his  daily  walk,  which  we  ourselves  as 
boys  have  felt  towards  some  cherished  and  valued  family 
friend.  How  much  of  their  successes  in  after-life  Masters 
Caesar,  Cato,  or  Scipio  owed  to  the  words  of  wisdom  which 
fell  from  the  lips  of  their  childhood's  instructor  history  does 
not  record  ;  the  Free  Forester  Club  both  knows  and  appre- 
ciates the  debt  it  owes  to  Edward  Rutter. 

And  now  it  is  difficult  to  know  whence  to  start  my  nar- 
rative. But  as  at  Chatham  I  played  my  first  match  for 
the  Free  Foresters,  and  whereas  I  have  played  more 
matches  in  my  life  against  the  R.E.  than  against  any 
other  one  club,  I  will  take  Chatham  as  my  starting-point. 
That  our  matches  there  have  been  most  pleasant  no  one 
who  has  ever  played  against  the  Engineers  on  the  Chatham 
lines  can  doubt.  On  that  somewhat  bleak  and  dreary- 
looking  ground  the  wickets  are  excellent,  the  cricket  keen, 
the  crowd  orderly  and  apparently  impartial,  the  company 
undeniably  good ;  and  if  the  wind  sometimes  blows  cold 
there  in  the  latter  days  of  August,  the  welcome  at  all  times 
is  warm  enough  to  satisfy  the  most  hypercritical.  Than 
those  twin-sister  corps,  the  R.E.  and  the  R.A.,  the  Free 
Forester  Club  has  no  dearer  foes.  But  apart  from  the 
pleasantness  of  our  visits  to  Chatham,  we  have  had  in  these 
latter  years,  with  but  few  exceptions,  a  series  of  most  even 
and  excellently  contested  matches.  Once  in  1885  the 
F.  F.  won  somewhat  easily,  and  again  in  1889  and  1890 
Albert  Thornton  in  a  high  wind,  which  fortunately  does  not 
materially  affect  his  action,  played  havoc  with  the   R.E. 


254  R'E.  MATCHES. 

wickets.  The  matches  have  generally  been  drawn,  and 
on  those  occasions  I  may  say  that  we  have  always  been, 
on  paper,  the  stronger  side,  have  usually  got  distinctly  the 
worst  of  the  match  in  the  first  innings,  sometimes  to  the 
extent  of  having  to  follow  on,  and  yet  at  the  finish  made 
our  opponents  bustle  to  save  rather  than  to  win  the  game. 
It  is  hard  to  account  for  those  apparent  inconsistencies. 
But  be  it  remembered  in  the  first  place  that  the  Chatham 
match  has  generally  followed  a  stay  at  Linton  Park,  where 
it  might  be  as  truly  said  as  of  Brussels  that — 

"  There  was  a  sound  of  revelry  by  night,     .    .     . 

and  bright 

The  lamps  shone  o'er  fair  women  and  brave  men : 
A  thousand  hearts  beat  happily  ;  and  when 
Music  arose  with  its  voluptuous  swell, 
Soft  eyes  looked  love  to  eyes  which  spake  again. 
And  all  went  merry  as  a  marriage-bell." 

Now  we  all  love  the  Linton  week  dearly,  and  I  shall 
have  much  to  say  in  its  praise  later  on ;  but  I  fancy  that 
Mr  Cornwallis  will  agree  with  me  that  this  sort  of  thing  is 
extremely  pleasant  at  the  time,  but  not  exactly  calculated 
to  improve  the  eye  on  the  following  day.  More  than 
once,  too,  when  we  have  been  in  the  field,  it  has  seemed 
to  me  that  the  thoughts  of  the  younger  Forester  have 
unconsciously  wandered  back  to  the  bright  faces  he  has 
left  behind  him  in  the  Weald  of  Kent  instead  of  being 
wholly  concentrated  on  the  game,  and  that  the  ball  of  the 
previous  night  has  still  possessed  a  greater  fascination  than 
that  more  prosaic  article  which  I  would  fain  have  had  him 
in  the  present  pursue. 

And  in  the  second  place,  a  certain  doughty  R.E.  colonel, 
who  has  worked  destruction  in  the  first  innings  of  more 
than  one  of  our  recent  matches  at  Chatham,  has  laboured 
so  hard  on  the  one  day  that  on  the  second  a  natural 
attack  of  stiffness  has  reminded  him  that  the  old  complaint, 
Anno  Domini,  must  occasionally  affect   the  powers  of  a 


TIVO    WICKETS  IN  ONE  BALL.  255 

man  who  was  the  greatest  bowler  in  the  British  Army. 
To  be  bowled  at  or  even  bowled  out  by  Jim  Fellowes  will, 
we  hope,  again  be  an  occasional  feature  in  our  matches  at 
Chatham. 

At  Chatham,  as  must  be  the  case  at  any  place  where 
a  series  of  matches  has  been  played,  there  have  been  some 
curious  incidents.  It  does  not  often  fall  to  the  lot  of  any 
bowler  to  capture  more  than  one  wicket  with  a  single  ball, 
but  in  1886,  the  only  occasion  on  which  I  personally 
remember  I.  D.  Walker  playing  in  a  F.  F.  match,  he  un- 
doubtedly did  bowl  a  ball  which  was  fatal  to  the  batsman 
at  either  end.  The  R.E.  wickets  had  been  falling  rather 
rapidly  in  the  second  innings,  but  Stafford,  perhaps  the 
soundest  if  not  the  most  brilliant  batsman  on  the  side,  and 
a  very  strong  side  it  was  then,  was  playing  a  patient  and 
steady  game,  and  had  apparently  got  the  measure  of  all  our 
bowling.  Unfortunately  for  him,  his  partner  walked  out 
to  the  last  ball  of  an  over  of  I.  D.'s  lobs,  and  drove  it  back 
so  hard  and  straight  that  Stafford,  who  had  backed  up  a 
yard  or  so,  could  not  get  out  of  the  way.  The  ball  struck 
him  hard  on  the  upper  arm,  and  then  dropped  gently  into 
mid-off's  hands  ;  all  the  power  was  taken  out  of  Stafford's 
arm,  and  he  was  easily  caught  off  the  first  ball  of  the  over 
from  the  other  end. 

On  another  occasion,  Timothy  O'Brien  having  elected 
to  take  137  in  his  own  style,  and  Sellars,  the  most  patient 
of  batsmen,  having  blocked  the  other  end  for  over  two 
hours  to  the  tune  of  some  fourteen  runs,  time  alone  seemed 
necessary  to  ensure  a  victory.  A  council  of  war  was  held,, 
and  we  determined — it  was  before  the  days  of  the  closure 
— to  finish  off  our  innings  as  quickly  as  possible.  Two 
men  not  unnaturally  objected  to  the  prospect  of  fielding  out 
twice  without  any  compensation  in  the  way  of  an  innings, 
and  were  accordingly  sent  in  next  and  allowed  to  do  their 
best.  As  evil  fate — their  evil  fate — would  have  it,  they 
both  got  out  unintentionally  with  quite  as  much  rapiditj^

as  could  be  desired  by  the  rest  of  us.  Then  I  went  in, 
meaning  to  have  a  hit  if  possible,  and  get  out  —  the 
latter  in  my  case  never  a  difficult  feat  to  accomplish. 
Hedley  was  bowling  and  I  ran  out  to  the  first  ball,  which 
happened  to  be  a  fast  and  straight  long-hop,  and  I  hit  it 
almost  perfectly  straight  up  into  the  air.  Harder  hits  I 
may  have  seen,  a  higher  never.  It  went  to  mid-on  where 
Von  Donop  was  standing,  and  seldom  was  a  fieldsman 
more  completely  flabbergasted.  There  was  a  high  wind, 
and  at  the  moment  a  bright  sun  was  shining  —  quite  a 
pleasant  change  to  most  of  us,  as  it  was  one  of  the  wettest 
and  coldest  of  days.  But  I  doubt  whether  Von  Donop 
much  appreciated  the  change,  as  the  ball,  after  having  paid 
its  respects  to  the  sun,  began  to  fall  in  the  most  provok- 
ingly  leisurely  manner  in  the  wind.  The  fieldsman  tried 
to  watch  the  ball :  we  all  watched  him.  His  face  was  well 
worth  studying,  the  expression  varying  between  concen- 
trated agony  and  hopeless  bewilderment.  For  a  moment 
he  was  stationary ;  then  he  tried  to  follow  the  tortuous 
course  of  the  ball,  turning  round  and  round  much  after  the 
fashion  of  a  puppy  chasing  its  own  tail ;  and  finally  he  sat 
down  on  a  very  muddy  patch,  exactly  as  the  ball  fell  some 
ten  yards  away  from  him.  He  looked  so  ludicrously 
unhappy  that  the  whole  field,  including  Renny-Tailyour, 
generally  the  strictest  of  disciplinarians,  simply  collapsed 
with  laughter. 

I  will  not  mention  the  name  of  a  Free  Forester  who 
played  in  one  of  our  matches  at  Chatham,  in  his  case  by 
the  way  a  qualifying  match,  but  I  will  briefly  give  what 
might  have  been  his  diary  of  a  two  days'  holiday. 

Friday,  Aug.  29. — 

1.  Bowled  first  ball  by  Pllcher. 

2.  Missed  the  first  ball  which  came  to  me  In  the  field — a 
high  catch — and  split  my  finger,  which  ached  consumedly  the 
whole  evening. 


CHATHAM.  257 

Saturday^  Aug.  30. — 

1.  Finger  still  aching :  every  ball  which  I  attempted  to  field 
seemed  to  come  to  that  one  finger,  with  the  result  that  I  mis- 
fielded  everything. 

2.  Bowled  again  first  ball. 

3.  Ground  slippery:  finger  sore:  spikes  worn  out  —  general 
result  was  that  I  invariably  fumbled  the  ball,  and  ft-equently  sat 
down  in  a  most  painful  and  involuntary  manner;  crowd  good- 
naturedly  roared  with  laughter  or  cheered  vociferously. 

4.  Fielded  a  hard  drive  so  brilliantly  and  so  unexpectedly 
that  both  batsmen  were  at  the  same  wicket :  to  that  wicket  I 
threw  very  hard  and  very  wide — result  a  4  over-throw.  "  Thocht 
I  heard  swearin'." 

5.  My  very  nice  dressing-bag  elected  to  roll  off  the  top  of  the 
cab,  and  everything  fell  out  into  the  mud  at  Chatham  Station. 

6.  Got  to  London  by  the  L.C.D.  just  in  time  to  miss  my 
train  at  G.W.R.  Had  to  wait  till  midnight  and  then  walk  home 
on  a  dark  and  wet  night. 

And  but  for  his  innate  modesty  the  victim  might  have 
added  that — he  kept  his  temper.  Penitent,  nervous,  dis- 
gusted with  himself,  inclined  to  put  up  his  cricket  effects 
for  auction — all  of  these  he  may  have  been,  but  he  was 
so  absolutely  amiable  under  most  depressing  circumstances 
that  he  was  unanimously  elected  a  Free  Forester  in  the 
following  spring,  and  has  on  several  occasions  done  yeo- 
man service  to  the  Club. 

But  the  enjoyment  of  a  match  at  Chatham  is  by  no 
means  limited  to  the  cricket-ground.  The  sappers  are 
as  cheery  hosts  in  the  mess-room  as  they  are  formidable 
opponents  on  the  lines.  And  it  was  in  the  mess-room 
some  years  ago  that  I  witnessed  a  most  ludicrous  incident. 
We  had  had  a  gay  evening.  After  a  lively  game  of  Rugby 
football  in  the  ante-room,  Walter  Bovill  on  the  one  side, 
and  Jim  Fellowes,  who  played  the  part  of  M.C.,  on  the 
other,  had  vied  with  each  other  in  feats  of  derring-do : 
Jack  Dale  had  fallen  a  most  egregious  cropper  in  a 
mounted  tournament,  and  the  gymnastics  were  only  ter- 
minated at  a  late  hour,  when  the  gallant   Colonel  posi- 

R

tively  declined  to  follow  Bovill  in  walking  round  the  room 
on  his  hands. 

"  No,  no ! "  he  remarked,  "  I  won't  try  that ;  let's  go 
and  have  some  broiled  bones,"  and  we  adjourned  to  the 
mess-room. 

It  was  then  that  Joe  Hornsby  conceived  the  charit- 
able idea  of  attempting  to  arrest  an  incipient  inclination 
to  baldness  on  the  part  of  John  Ricketts.  The  pair 
were  sitting  opposite  to  each  other  at  the  supper-table, 
and  John,  leaning  over  the  table  to  reach  some  con- 
diment, speedily  paid  the  penalty  for  the  breach  of 
etiquette.  He  was  in  those  days  the  proud  possessor 
of  a  mighty  forelock,  which  has  long  since  joined  the 
majority.  It  may  have  been  that  to  Joseph's  classical 
mind  recurred  the  old  proverb, — 

"  Prendite  praecipitem — post  est  occasio  calva." 

At  any  rate,  he  gently,  but  firmly,  grasped  the  forelock, 
and  then  discovered  that  John  was  very  much  in  the  same 
plight  as  occasio.  For  on  the  back  of  the  head  was  ex- 
posed to  view  a  round  bald  patch  some  three  inches  in 
diameter.  After  a  brief  but  searching  inspection  of  the 
place,  Joe's  eye  wandered  round  the  table  till  he  caught 
sight  of  a  pat  of  butter.  This  he  put  with  much  care  in 
the  centre  of  the  bald  patch,  and  then  proceeded  to  spread 
it  with  a  knife  much  after  the  fashion  of  a  nurse  buttering 
a  piece  of  bread  for  a  child.  Both  parties — operator  and 
patient — seemed  to  recognise  the  gravity  and  delicate 
nature  of  the  operation.  The  extreme  care  which  Hornsby 
took  to  spread  his  pat  of  butter  exactly  on  the  bald  patch 
was  only  to  be  equalled  by  the  patience  displayed  by 
John.  There  was  no  undue  hurry  on  the  one  part,  on  the 
other  no  unseemly  struggling.  When  the  operation  was 
quite  completed,  Joe  released  the  forelock  and  both  went 
on   with    their    supper  as   unconcernedly   as   if    nothing

unusual  had  occurred.  After  a  few  minutes  the  butter 
commenced  to  melt  and  finally  to  drip,  and  then,  for  the 
first  time,  John  became  aware  of  the  exact  nature  of  the 
application — up  till  that  moment  all  he  knew,  as  he  subse- 
quently confessed,  was  that  something  cool  had  been  put 
on  his  head,  and  the  sensation  had  been  rather  pleasant 
than  otherwise.  However,  he  did  not  seem  the  least  dis- 
concerted when  he  found  what  had  really  happened,  but 
merely  wiped  the  butter  off  and  went  on  eating.  It  is  to 
be  regretted  that  from  a  medical  point  of  view  the  opera- 
tion proved  signally  unsuccessful — possibly  oleo-margarine 
might  have  produced  more  effect.

CHAPTER    XXXIII. 


OTHER    MATCHES    IN    KENT. 


Had  Noah  once  landed  from  his  Ark 

Upon  the  Mount  at  Linton  Park, 

He  might  have  pitched  his  cricket  tent, 

And  played  a  match,  Noah's  team  v.  Kent. 

A  perfect  pitch,  a  lovely  ground, 

I'm  sure  the  Patriarch  would  have  found : 

A  Paradise  for  an  Eleven — 

The  very  ground  is  close  to  heaven." 


/. — Linton  Park. 


If  at  the  present  moment  I  cannot  recall  the  closing 
lines  of  our  poet  Spencer  Gore's  effusion,  I  can  at  least 
cordially  endorse  the  sentiment  they  contained,  which  was 
to  the  effect  that  the  Free  Foresters  were  better  off  than 


LINTON  PARK.  267 

the  Patriarch's  team  might  have  been,  inasmuch  as  we 
latter-day  cricketers  have  found  Mr  and  Mrs  Cornwallis 
reigning  at  Linton  Park,  and  making  things  extremely- 
pleasant  for  their  visitors.  Yes,  we  have  had  everything 
at  Linton  that  can  make  the  surroundings  of  a  cricket- 
match  pleasant ;  and,  most  important  fact  of  all,  the  cricket 
has  been  really  good  and  keen :  and  if  it  has  happened 
that  we  have  on  the  whole  had  a  little  bit  the  best  of  our 
matches  there,  we  have  had  to  work  hard  for  those  we 
have  won,  and  the  drawn  games  might  easily  have  gone 
either  way.  When  I  mention  the  names  of  W.  H.  Patter- 
son, Leslie  Wilson,  W.  Rashleigh,  Captain  Hamilton,  F. 
Marchant,  E.  C.  Streatfeild,  A.  M.  Streatfeild-Moore,  S. 
Christopherson,  T.  Tonge,  M.  C.  Kemp,  Major  Friend, 
and  the  Rev.  R.  T.  Thornton,  it  will  be  seen  that  we  have 
on  various  occasions  had  arrayed  against  us  the  pick  of 
the  Kentish  amateurs,  with  a  little  bit  of  Surrey  thrown 
in.  Most  of  these  celebrities  have  once  and  again  taken 
runs,  though  Patterson  and  Streatfeild-Moore  alone  have 
exceeded  the  century ;  while  on  our  side  John  Ricketts 
and  Jack  Turner  have  also  scored  over  100,  and  other 
large  scorers  have  been  A.  G.  Asher,  A.  M.  Inglis,  and  those 
m.odern  Ajaxes  the  brothers  Spens.  We  have  invariably 
been  captained  by  the  elder  Spens,  to  whom  is  due  the 
credit  of  instituting  that  most  cheery  week  in  Kent ;  but 
once — it  must  have  been,  I  think,  when  he  declined  to 
go  on  bowling — he  was  temporarily  superseded,  and  the 
affair  was  managed  by  a  syndicate,  of  which  he  was  kindly 
allowed  to  represent  the  Corporation,  a  post  which  he 
filled  with  becoming  gravity.  But  in  addition  to  the 
cricket  talent,  we  have  also  had  arrayed  against  us  at 
Linton  a  goodly  "Band  of  Sisters,"  to  say  nothing  of 
wives,  mothers,  cousins,  and  ew^w  fiancees  of  our  opponents, 
all  keenly  anxious  for  our  defeat,  the  triumph  of  the  op- 
posite   faction   in   general,   and   the   success   of  favoured 


268 


OTHER  MATCHES  IN  KENT. 


individuals  in  particular.  I  have  at  some  time  or  other 
played  cricket  in  almost  every  single  county  in  England, 
and  in  a  few  Welsh  and  Scotch  counties  as  well ;  but 
nowhere  else  have  I  ever  seen  so — if  I  may  use  the  word — 
intelligent  and  so  keenly  interested  an  audience  of  the  fair 
sex  as  that  which  has  year  after  year  watched  our  match 
at  Linton,  and  with  all  the  strength  of  feminine  pertinacity 
willed  our  discomfiture.  Still,  when  we  have  been  vic- 
torious, they  have  graciously  condoned  our  error ;  and 
if  party  spirit  has  run  high  in  the  cricket-field,  we  have 
buried  the  hatchet  later  on  in  the  day,  and  have  spent 
most  cheery  and  sociable  evenings.  The  member  for 
Maidstone  and  his  charming  wife  have  indeed  deserved 
well  of  the  Free  Forester  Club ;  and  their  reception  of  us 
has  been  so  cordial  that  when  the  time  comes  for  us  to 
strike  our  colours  to  the  Linton  XI,  we  shall  only  be  too 
ready  to  avow  with  De  Grantmesnil  that  we  have  been 
"vanquished  as  much  by  the  courtesy  as  by  the  address 
of  our  opponent."

272  OTHER  MATCHES  IN  KENT 

II.— Mote  Park. 

On  the  first  two  days  of  the  Linton  week  we  have  played 
at  the  Mote,  where  we  have  had  a  series  of  pleasant  matches, 
though  we  have  occasionally  found  the  opposition  a  little  bit 
too  good  for  us.  If,  on  the  one  hand,  I  am  ready  to  admit 
that  the  better  side  has  usually  won,  which  is  all  as  it  should 
be,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  Forester  sides  at  the  Mote 
have  not  been  quite  so  strong  as  those  we  have  put  into 
the  field  at  Linton,  and  that  the  former  is  a  ground  which 
requires  a  little  education,  as  ability  to  act  up-hill  and  down- 
hill is  not  always  to  be  expected  from  men  who  have  been 
accustomed  to  bat  and  field  on  the  flat.  The  batting  of 
F.  M.  Atkins  and  Walter  Wright's  bowling  have  been  im- 
portant factors  in  our  adversaries'  success,  and  if  Kent 
possesses  eleven  better  all  -  round  cricketers  than  the 
former,  it  must  have  a  much  stronger  side  than  results 
would  lead  one  to  imagine.  Whether  Walter  Wright's 
bowling  would  be  quite  as  formidable  on  any  ground 
except  the  Mote  is  an  open  question.  It  is  recorded  in 
the  Forester  scores  that  in  1889  A.  M.  Inglis  and  myself 
scored  88  runs  off  11  consecutive  overs  in  20  minutes. 
And  I  ought  to  mention  that  in  1887,  when  a  prodigious 
amount  of  runs  were  scored,  Walter  Wright  made  well 
over  200  for  the  Mote,  and  Lionel  Spens  played  two 
magnificent  not-out  innings  for  115  and  Zy,  and  thereby 
not  only  covered  himself  with  glory  but  saved  the  match. 
In  1 89 1  that-  most  excellent  all-round  cricketer,  J.  A. 
Turner,  scored  exactly  one-half  of  the  runs  made  by  our 
side  on  a  very  tricky  wicket,  and  when  he  was  bowled  in 
the  second  innings  the  telegraph-board  registered  79 — 5 — 
6^.  A  catch  at  cover-point  made  by  Atthill  in  the  second 
innings  of  the  Mote  fairly  brought  down  the  house.  It 
will  be  noticed  that  in  this  innings  ten  men  on  a  really 
strong  batting  side  only  contributed  15  runs  between  them.

///. — Boxley. 

For  two  or  three  years  past  there  have  been  Forester 
matches  played  at  Boxley,  where  Mr  Style  has  got  to- 
gether a  strong  side  to  oppose  us  ;  and  if  once  at  least  we 


278 


OTHER  MATCHES  IN  KENT. 


have  lost  our  match  there,  we  have  had  the  pleasure  of 
knowing  that  a  good  many  of  our  opponents  are  entitled 
to  wear  Free  Forester  colours,  so  that  we  have  only  been 
hoisted  on  petards  of  our  own  production.  In  the  one 
match  I  played  for  the  Club  v.  Boxley,  Herbert  Thursby 
hit  tremendously  hard  for  lOO  on  our  side,  and  Frank 
Gresson  got  lOO  for  Boxley,  his  innings  being  terminated 
by  a  most  extraordinary  catch  made  by  L-  Spens,  who 
caught  a  sharp  drive  straight  at  his  nose  exactly  as  if  he 
was  brushing  a  fly  off  that  appendage. 

As  we  grow  callous  with  age  we  may  forget  our  occa- 
sional defeats,  even  though  at  the  moment  they  may 
rankle — as  a  beating  at  any  game  should,  if  the  game  is 
worth  playing  at  all,  rankle — in  our  minds ;  but  we  shall 
not  so  lightly  forget  the  many  pleasant  days  spent  in  the 
hop-country,  and  the  kindly  welcome  and  warm  hospitality 
we  have  received  in  many  houses  in  the  Maidstone  district. 
Why  there  should  be  such  an  abominable  service  of  trains 
to  one  of  the  most  attractive  parts  of  England  will  ever 
remain  a  mystery  to  my  mind,  unless  the  directors  of  the 
various  lines  have  so  thoroughly  gauged  the  hospitable  in- 
clinations of  the  men  of  Kent  as  to  think  it  advisable 
to  put  some  barrier  in  the  way  of  too  great  an  influx  of 
visitors.

IV.— R,A.  Matches. 

Alas !  that  my  account  of  the  matches  against  the  R.A. 
at  Woolwich  must  of  necessity  be  meagre,  and  alas  !  for  the 
reason,  which  is,  that  on  only  two  occasions  I  have  been 
able  to  play  there  for  the  Foresters.  Once  we  won  hand- 
somely, when  Freddy  Thesiger,  who  had  played  the  teeto- 
taller with  signal  want  of  cricket  success  on  the  four  previ- 
ous days,  was  on  the  eve  of  the  Woolwich  match  driven  by 
desperation  to  mixing  port  wine  and  champagne,  and  was 
so  much  invigorated  by  the  unwonted  excess  that  he  made 
lOO  in  fine  style  ;  when  Albert  Thornton  was  so  much 
conscience-stricken  at  the  unconscionable  time  that  it  took 
him  to  scrape  up  60  that  he  was  only  too  ready  to  retire  on 
being  caught  first-bound,  much  to  the  bewilderment  of  some 
of  the  fieldsmen  and  the  manifest  disconcertment  of  the 
umpire ;  when  most  of  us  scored  freely,  and  Alfred  Inglis 
kindly  did  all  the  fielding  for  our  side.  Time  may  have 
tempered  to  some  degree  that  ready  enthusiasm  ;  but  a  few 
years  ago,  when  Inglis  was  playing  on  my  side,  I  found  it 
expedient  to  yell  out  "  Inglis  "  whenever  a  ball  was  hit  at 
all  high  in  the  air,  by  way  of  saving  from  utter  destruction 
any  other  rash  or  unwary  fieldsman  who  might  feel  inclined 
or  possibly  entitled  to  go  for  the  catch.  He  was  the  most 
zealous  and  untiring  fieldsman  I  ever  saw,  the  sort  of  man 
who,  if  standing  or  fretting  at  deep  square-leg,  might  be  re- 
lied upon  to  back  up  cover-point  on  an  emergency.  Who 
that  has  experienced  it  will  ever  forget  the  sound,  as  of  a 
mighty  rushing  steam-engine  behind  him,  as  he  went  to 
fetch  a  fourer  when  Inglis  was  on  the  war-path !  His 
activity  in  very  sooth  covered  not  only  much  ground,  but 
a  multitude  of  other  people's  sins. 

In  the  other  match  I  played  at  Woolwich  things  did  not 
go  quite  so  well.  In  the  first  place,  we  went  down  short, 
and  had  to  hunt  high  and  low  for  substitutes  ;  then  again

rain,  and  on  the  second  day  the  ground  was  very  sloppy 
and  the  weather  cold.  Finally,  ours  was  not  a  good  side, 
and  we  got  distinctly  the  worst  of  the  inevitable  draw.  A 
rather  curious  incident  occurred  towards  the  close  of  the 
R.A.  innings.  Curteis  was  batting,  and  had  made  a  lot  of 
runs,  but  he  knew  all  along  that  at  5.30  he  would  have  to 
retire.  A  wicket  happened  to  fall  to  the  last  ball  but  one 
of  an  over,  and  as  his  time  was  all  but  up,  Curteis,  had  he 
been  a  wise  man,  would  have  retired  then  ;  but,  fortunately 
for  the  look  of  the  score-sheet,  and  unfortunately  for  the 
new-comer,  the  greedy  gunner  elected  to  stay  and  receive 
that  one  ball.  He  hit  out  wildly,  made  a  miss-hit,  and 
dropped  into  the  hands  of  one  of  our  substitutes  at  mid-on 
such  a  dolly  catch  that  he  burst  out  laughing,  and  ran  off 
towards  the  pavilion.  But  that  substitute  being,  unhke 
Curteis,  a  man  of  ready  wit,  commenced  to  play  a  species 
of  pat-ball  with  the  catch,  and  finally  fumbled  it  right  on 
to  the  wicket  of  the  other  batsman,  who  was  standing  out 
of  his  ground  watching  the  performance,  feeling  probably, 
as  most  of  us  did,  that  it  was  really  beyond  the  power  of 
mortal  man  to  drop  the  catch. 

"  Plauserunt  omnes  :  batsmanius  exit  uterque." 

I  was  more  sorry  for  that  batsman,  who,  as  it  happened, 
had  come  from  afar  especially  for  that  match,  than  I  ever 
felt  even  for  Mrs  Leo  Hunter's  expiring  frog.  In  1893 
A.  J.  Thornton  with  his  lobs  captured  four  wickets  in 
one  over,  performing  the  hat  trick.  But  I  gather  that, 
taken  as  a  whole,  the  matches  at  Woolwich  have  not  been 
entirely  satisfactory,  and  the  fault  has  most  certainly  not 
been  on  the  side  of  the  Gunners,  who  play  good  cricket 
themselves,  and  in  many  seasons  have  been,  on  their  own 
ground  at  any  rate,  a  difficult  side  to  beat.  Perhaps  the 
time  of  year  at  which  the  match  has  been  played  has  had 
something  to  do  with  the  comparative  apathy  shown  about 
what  ought  to  be  one  of  our  best  matches.     A  Whitsuntide

which  falls  in  the  middle  of  May  is  apt  to  tempt  men  who 
are  in  business  and  get  few  holidays  in  the  early  summer, 
to  find  their  pastime  elsewhere  than  in  the  cricket-field, 
and  they  naturally  choose  a  game  which  is  not  so  com- 
pletely made  or  marred  by  weather.  If  May  has  the  re- 
putation of  being  a  sunny  month,  the  forecast  for  that 
particular  section  of  May  in  which  our  calendar  ordains 
that  Whitsuntide  should  fall  would  in  most  years  run 
"cold  and  damp,"  and  nothing  so  entirely  spoils  the 
pleasure  of  cricket  as  cold  and  damp  weather.  But  as  the 
British  public  demand  that  a  certain  amount  of  cricket 
should  be  played  for  their  edification,  such  F.  F.  as  are 
county  players  have  a  prior  attachment ;  and  a  good  many 
sober-minded  members  of  the  Club,  who  might  possibly 
play  in  the  absence  of  any  counter  -  attraction,  prefer  to 
watch  the  matches  at  Lord's  and  the  Oval,  and  see  other 
people  shiver  instead  of  shivering  themselves.  Finally,  to 
men  of  my  own  profession,  from  whom  the  ranks  of  the 
Foresters  are  largely  recruited  in  August,  a  Whitsuntide 
holiday  is  a  myth  or  an  anachronism.  Hence  it  has  come 
to  pass  that  weak  and  at  times  short  sides  have  gone  to 
Woolwich,  and  that  when  weather  has  permitted  the  match 
to  be  finished  at  all,  the  Foresters  have  lost.

CHAPTER    XXXIV. 


MATCHES    IN    THE    MIDLANDS. 


A  ROVING  club  in  very  truth  is  this  of  ours,  and  it  is  a 
matter  of  considerable  difficulty  to  follow  its  peregrinations. 
A  series  of  matches  is  inaugurated  in  one  district,  and  then 
something  happens  to  break  the  chain,  and  the  Foresters 
for  a  time  disappear,  only  to  reappear  on  some  future  occa- 
sion under  new  auspices. 

For  some  i^^  years  we  had  a  merry  one-day  encounter 
with  C.  J.  Hegan's  XI  on  his  pretty  ground  near  Watford. 
I  had  the  good  fortune  to  play  in  this  match  in  three  con- 
secutive seasons,  and  on  the  last  two  occasions  got  up  the 
F.  F.  XL  Each  of  these  matches  had  its  own  peculiar 
features,  but  in  one  respect  all  were  very  much  alike,  there 
having  generally  been  almost  as  many  Foresters  playing 
against  as  for  the  Club. 

In  the  first  year  we  were  soundly  thrashed,  a  result 
mainly,  so  far  as  I  remember,  due  to  the  excessive  good- 

T

nature  of  our  captain,  who,  by  way  of  what  he,  or  it  may 
have  been  Hegan,  called  "  equalising  the  sides,"  gave  over 
to  the  opposition  sundry  men  who  had  been  originally 
enlisted  in  our  service.  It  was  in  this  match  that  A.  E. 
Leatham,  then  a  great  buyer  of  tups,  signally  distin- 
guished himself  by  fielding  long-leg  to  his  own  bowling, 
and  running  out  a  man  who  was  attempting  a  fifth  or 
sixth  run  from  a  hit  into  a  neighbouring  plantation. 

"  I  don't  want  a  long  -  leg,"  remarked  Leatham  with 
cheery  confidence  as  he  took  the  ball ;  and  when  he  com- 
menced with  a  wide  on  the  off,  it  really  looked  as  if  he 
was  in  his  rights.  But  in  the  second  over  came  a  gruesome 
half-volley  to  leg,  which  was  hit  fair  and  square  in  the 
middle  of  the  bat.  Mid-on  made  a  merit  of  necessity,  and 
began  to  move  in  the  direction  of  the  vanishing  ball,  but, 
much  to  his  relief,  off  galloped  Leatham  capless  and — he 
will  forgive  the  remark  —  hairless,  and  shortly  proved 
that  he  not  only  runs  rather  faster  than  he  bowls,  but  is 
also  a  long  and  a  straight  thrower,  for  he  ran  one  of  the 
batsmen  out  from  a  prodigious  distance.  Nor  was  that 
wicket  his  only  stroke  of  good  luck,  for  presently  Green- 
field hit  him  magnificently  on  the  on-side  into  the  top  of 
a  high  tree  a  very  long  way  off,  without  any  run  being 
scored  for  the  hit.  Every  one  except  the  umpire  thought 
that  the  tree  was  a  boundary,  and  the  umpire  kept  his  own 
counsel  till  the  ball  was  returned. 

"  How  many  was  that  1 "  inquired  the  batsman,  as  he 
prepared  to  receive  the  next  ball,  and  he  spoke  with  the 
air  of  a  man  who  has  just  done  a  big  thing. 

"  Run  it  out,"  was  the  chilling  response. 

In  the  next  two  years,  when  I  got  up  the  Forester  side, 
I  am  afraid  that  Hegan  did  not  find  me  so  willing  to  part 
as  my  predecessor  had  been.  We  both  had  strong  sides, 
and  the  Foresters  just  got  home  on  each  occasion.  The 
first  of  these  two  matches  was  not   productive  of  large 


ASH-SOWN  WICKETS.  291 

scores,  as  after  playing  for  about  an  hour  we  began  to 
imagine  that  Hegan  must  have  been  holding  high  festivities 
and  roasting  oxen  whole  upon  the  pitch  during  the  winter 
months.  It  was  what  a  Scotsman  would  have  called  a 
"  saft "  day,  and  we  did  not  commence  play  much  before 
one  o'clock.  The  wicket  was  very  slow  and  easy  at  first, 
but  as  the  ground  cut  up,  cinders  of  all  sorts  and  sizes 
cropped  up  in  unexpected  places,  and  things  did  not  im- 
prove as  the  day  went  on.  It  turned  out  that  some 
wiseacre  had  informed  Hegan  that  ashes  improved  the 
turf,  and  the  ashes  had  been  put  on  with  no  niggard  hand. 
As  a  means  of  ensuring  that  every  player  should  have  at 
least  one  innings  in  a  short  one-day  match,  I  can  con- 
fidently recommend  the  ash  theory.  Neither  batsman  nor 
bowler  had  the  slightest  conception  what  any  given  ball 
was  going  to  do :  it  was  quite  an  open  question  whether 
it  would  shoot  dead,  go  over  the  wicket-keeper's  head,  or 
twist  a  yard  either  way.  Albert  Thornton  distinguished 
himself  by  making  a  barefaced  attempt  to  put  an  end  to 
our  host's  existence.  He  began  by  scraping  away  with 
praiseworthy  patience  at  the  mud,  ashes,  and  ball,  until 
he  had  induced  Hegan  to  stand  in  rather  close  at  mid-off. 
He  then  suddenly  ran  out  into  the  middle  of  the  pitch,  and 
made  a  real  fine  drive  straight  at  Hegan's  heart.  Much  to 
his  credit,  and  perhaps  a  little  to  his  surprise,  Hegan,  who 
received  a  nasty  knock,  clutched  the  ball  as  it  rebounded 
from  his  body,  and  A.  J.  had  to  go.  And  then  was  to  be 
seen  the  unusual  spectacle  of  a  batsman  profusely  apolo- 
gising to  the  man  who  had  caught  him  in  the  act  of  trans- 
gressing every  rule  of  the  game  of  batting  as  commonly 
practised  by  A.  J.  Thornton. 

In  my  third  year  both  sides  were  again  well  represented. 
Seldom,  I  think,  has  a  stronger  all-round  XI  played  for 
the  Foresters.  Bowling  was  our  weakest  point,  and  in 
this  department  of  the  game  Hegan's  XI  had  the  pull  of 


292  MATCHES  IN  THE  MIDLANDS. 

us,  as  he  had  got  hold  of  six  fairly  useful  trundlers  in  the 
persons  of  H.  G.  Tylecote,  C.  Pigg,  W.  N.  Roe,  D.  H. 
Jephson,  G.  W.  Hillyard,  and  T.  Bigge,  who  in  that  par- 
ticular season  did  good  service  for  the  Engineers.  In  the 
end — a  rather  bitter  end  for  Hegan — we  won  a  really 
sporting  match ;  but  owing  to  some  carelessness  in  the 
scoring,  our  opponents  had  fair  ground  for  not  being 
entirely  satisfied  with  their  defeat.  For  us  Arthur  Heath 
played  a  fine  innings,  and  both  Hewitt  and  Charlie  Cobb 
treated  the  spectators  to  some  tall  hitting :  altogether  we 
piled  up  about  280, — quite  enough  runs,  as  we  thought,  for 
a  one-day  match. 

It  had  been  arranged  that  we  should  play  till  6.30,  and 
that,  if  there  was  any  likelihood  of  finishing,  the  match 
should  go  on  for  an  extra  quarter  of  an  hour.  At  6.30 
there  was  just  an  off-chance  of  a  definite  conclusion, 
Hegan's  side  having  three  wickets  to  fall,  and  some  45 
runs  to  make ;  and  so  we  agreed  to  go  on  for  that  extra 
quarter  of  an  hour,  though  it  involved  running  our  train 
desperately  close.  At  6.45  there  were  still  three  wickets  to 
fall,  and  still  20  runs  to  get.  Hegan  thought  that  it  would 
be  a  pity  to  allow  so  good  a  match  to  remain  drawn,  and 
on  the  principle  that  a  moral  is  quite  as  unsatisfactory  as 
an  actual  defeat,  I  quite  agreed  with  him.  But,  on  the 
other  hand,  the  train  had  to  be  considered.  Our  host 
kindly  offered  dinner  to  any  of  us  who  would  stay  and 
play  the  match  out,  and  some  half-dozen  of  the  side,  who 
had  only  to  get  to  London  some  time  that  night,  readily 
acceded  to  his  proposition.  But  the  rest,  including  most 
of  our  bowling  talent,  had  no  option  in  the  matter,  and 
were  obliged  to  go.  So  with  six  Foresters  and  five  sub- 
stitutes we  again  took  the  field,  and  in  ten  minutes  the 
runs  were,  as  we  thought,  hit  off.  But  by  the  time  that 
we  had  reached  the  tent  and  congratulated  Hegan,  the 
scorers  came  to  announce  that  there  was  an  error  of  10 


MATCH  NEVER  LOST  TILL    WON.  293 

runs  in  the  score,  and  that  consequently  10  more  runs 
were  still  required.  So  again  we  went  out,  ostensibly  for 
the  purpose  of  giving  them  the  chance  of  knocking  off 
those  10  runs ;  but,  as  it  happened,  we  got  the  three 
wickets  and  won  the  match.  A  friendly  discussion  fol- 
lowed at  dinner.  W.  N.  Roe,  who  had  made  upwards  of 
80,  always  religiously  counts  his  runs  as  he  scores  them, 
and  he  had  positively  asserted  that  he  had  made  10  more 
than  the  scorers  had  accredited  to  him.  '^wt,  per  contra^ 
we  in  the  field  had  remarked  on  the  astounding  rapidity 
with  which  the  telegraph-board  had  covered  the  distance 
between  150  and  170;  and  if  the  scoring  had  been  of  so 
casual  a  character  as  to  rob  any  one  batsman  of  10  runs, 
it  might  just  as  easily  have  added  those  10  to  other  men's 
scores.  At  any  rate,  no  amount  of  argument  or  assertion 
could  controvert  the  fact  that  according  to  the  score-sheet 
we  had  made  9  more  runs  than  our  opponents — and  so  the 
victory  lay  with  us. 

That  Roe  was  absolutely  correct  as  to  the  number  of 
the  runs  that  he  had  made  I  believe  to  this  day  ;  but  it  is 
much  more  probable  that  some  one  else  got  the  credit  of 
those  important  10  runs  than  that  they  were  altogether 
omitted,  and  it  was  satisfactory  to  us  to  feel  that  our 
opponents  had  during  their  own  innings  kept  the  score. 
So  it  fell  out  that  we  six  who  had  stayed  behind  had  the 
double  satisfaction  of  winning  the  match,  and  of  eating 
the  excellent  dinner  which  our  host  kindly  provided  in 
spite  of  the  bad  turn  we  had  done  him.  Verily  and  in 
truth,  a  cricket-match  is  never  lost  till  it  is  won.  And  to 
point  the  moral  further,  I  will  take  two  other  Forester 
matches  quite  out  of  their  turn,  each  of  which  afforded  a 
vivid  illustration  of  the  breadth  of  that  gulf  which  lies 
between  the  possibilities  and  the  probabilities  of  cricket. 
Once  at  Portsmouth,  in  1888,  a  Forester  XI  was  beaten 
by  a  few  runs  by  the  United   Services,  for  whom   P.  J. 


294  MATCHES  IN  THE  MIDLANDS. 

Henery,  whom  I  presume  to  be  a  Volunteer,  and  L.  Ham- 
ilton scored  freely.  Notwithstanding  their  exertions,  we 
had  a  good  deal  the  best  of  a  long  two  days'  cricket,  and 
it  looked  as  if  nothing  but  time  was  wanting  to  ensure  our 
easy  victory.  Walter  Bovill  was  our  commander,  and  he, 
like  Hegan,  felt  that  it  was  hard  lines  that  a  match  should 
be  left  drawn  in  our  favour  when  an  extra  half-hour  would 
enable  us  to  finish  it ;  and  the  captain  of  the  U.S.  team,  a 
thorough  sportsman,  readily  assented  to  Bovill's  proposi- 
tion that  play  should  continue  till  seven  o'clock.  Poor 
Hornby's  ipagnanimity  met  with  its  due  reward  ;  for  on 
a  wicket  which  was  quite  as  good  as  at  any  period  of  the 
match,  we  failed  to  get  the  necessary  lOO  odd  runs,  though 
we  had  made  nearly  300  in  our  first  innings.  We  were 
so  cock-sure  of  victory  that  one  man,  a  very  steady  bat, 
had  been  allowed  to  go  home,  and  several  others  had 
changed,  and  had  to  hurry  in  as  they  were.  A  slow 
bowler,  with  the  setting  sun  behind  his  arm,  did  the 
execution  ;  but  even  if  some  slight  excuse  might  be  made 
on  the  ground  of  indifferent  light,  we  really  had  only  our- 
selves to  blame  for  our  miserable  exhibition.  Walter 
Bovill  himself  got  nearly  half  the  runs  scored,  but  re- 
ceived little  assistance.  It  may  readily  be  conjectured 
that  we  fell  foul  of  him  for  having  arranged  to  go  on 
beyond  the  stipulated  time,  and  that  he  with  much  more 
reason  retorted  that  he  had  not  conceived  it  possible  that 
nine  men  could  make  such  fools  of  themselves.  If  we 
had  recovered  our  tempers  by  the  next  day,  we  none  of  us 
cared  to  talk  much  about  that  match  at  Portsmouth. 

The  other  was  a  still  more  extraordinary  case  of  the 
fallibility  of  human  hopes.  That  the  match  could  ever 
be  finished  at  all  seemed  to  be  almost  impossible ;  that  we 
could  win,  absolutely  so.  It  was  played  three  years  ago 
(1892),  in  variable  weather,  and  on  a  still  more  variable 
wicket,  at  Aldershot.     We  won  the  toss,  and  soon  found

that  the  wicket  was  very  tricky;  but  it  improved  as  the 
day  went  on,  and  with  a  distinctly  weaker  side,  the 
Division  almost  equalled  our  score  overnight  for  the  loss 
of  3  wickets.  A  mistaken  idea  that  a  review — that  ap- 
parently indispensable  accompaniment  of  a  cricket-match 
at  Aldershot — would  stop  play  till  luncheon-time,  caused 
three  of  our  men  to  absent  themselves  on  the  second 
morning ;  and  though  the  opposite  side  insisted  on  send- 
ing out  one  substitute,  and  offered  more,  we  felt  that  we 
were  so  entirely  in  the  wrong  that  we  preferred  to  go  on 
with  nine  men  in  the  field  till  luncheon-time,  when  the 
truants  turned  up.  Under  the  circumstances,  we  did  fairly 
well  to  get  rid  of  our  opponents  for  about  60  more  runs 
than  we  had  scored.  It  was  almost  a  necessity  for  E.  C. 
Streatfield  and  myself,  who  had  some  way  to  go  on  that 
Saturday  night,  to  catch  a  train  at  5.30 ;  and  most  cer- 
tainly when  we  left  the  ground  at  4.45  we  were  justified 
in  thinking  that  a  draw  was  a  certainty.  We  had  7  good 
wickets  to  fall,  not  much  bowling  to  contend  against,  the 
balance  of  runs  had  been  knocked  off,  two  men  were  ap- 
parently well  set,  and  there  was  an  hour  and  three-quarters 
more  play,  less  the  interval  between  the  innings.  But  as 
soon  as  we  had  left  the  ground  a  collapse  set  in,  one  of 
our  soundest  batsmen  was  most  unnecessarily  absent,  and 
eventually  the  Division  were  set  to  make  about  40  runs  in 
an  hour.  That  looked  an  easy  task  enough,  and  when  i 
wicket  was  down  for  28  all  seemed  over  but  the  shouting. 
It  was  then  that  C.  Toppin  came  to  the  rescue,  and,  ably 
backed  by  Asher,  disposed  of  the  other  9  wickets  in  about 
six  overs  for  as  many  runs.  One  of  the  most  curious  parts 
of  the  whole  affair  was  that  Toppin  had  hardly  bowled  for 
us  at  all  during  the  week,  as  he  was  suffering  from  a 
sprained  side — the  bete  noir  of  a  fast  bowler — and  had 
begged  to  be  excused  bowling.  But  it  did  so  happen  that 
he  had  been  one  of  the  absentees  in  the  morning,  and

felt  so  conscience-stricken  at  his  misdemeanour  that  he 
pluckily  chose  to  ignore  the  sprained  side,  and  to  bowl  for 
all  that  he  was  worth ;  and  on  that  wicket  he  was  simply 
unplayable.  As  had  been  the  case  with  us  at  Portsmouth, 
several  of  the  opposition  had  changed,  and  had  to  go  in  to 
be  demolished  by  Toppin  in  their  workaday  clothes.  Toppin 
did  the  hat-trick  once,  and  twice  besides  got  2  wickets  in  an 
over ;  and  I  doubt  whether  such  a  bowling  feat  has  ever 
been  equalled  in  the  annals  of  Free  Forester  cricket. 

It  has  been  a  matter  of  deep  regret  to  a  good  many 
Free  Foresters  that  a  most  enjoyable  week  at  Upton 
House  has  of  late  years  found  no  place  on  our  card,  and 
that,  owing  to  the  departure  from  the  neighbourhood  of 
our  quondam  host  and  hostess,  the  doors  of  a  place  we  so 
dearly  loved  in  the  past  are  now  practically  closed  to  us. 
Nothing  can  ever  quite  fill  the  gap.  We  may  find  better 
grounds,  it  is  true,  than  either  Deddington,  Banbury,  or 
Middleton  ;  cheerier  matches  we  shall  never  have ;  and 
the  long  chatty  drives  and  the  gay  evenings  spent  in  the 
miniature  drawing  -  room  and  the  quaint  old  smoking- 
room  at  Upton  can  hardly  be  reproduced.  Nodes  Am- 
brosiance  those  were  indeed,  and  Nodes  Nedarince  to  boot ; 
and  if  grouse  and  champagne  took  the  place  of  the  more 
orthodox  articles,  what  Sybarite  could  wish  for  better 
fare }  Who  that  was  privileged  to  witness  the  sight  will 
ever  forget  the  reproduction  of  the  bombardment  of  Alex- 
andria by  Harry  Maul,  when,  having  raised  a  mighty  pile 
of  cushions  to  represent  the  doomed  city,  he  implored  and 
entreated  every  member  of  the  smoking-room  party  in 
turn  to  sit  upon  the  top  and  play  the  part  of  Arabi ! — or 
who  that  took  part  in  that  great  lawn-tennis  tournament 
wherein  six  of  the  Upton  House  party  made  rings  round 
the  champions  of  a  local  club  on  one  by-day,  will  not 
recall  the  utterances  of  the  unintentionally  and  yet  most 
irresistibly  comic  man,  who,  after  convulsing  the  luncheon-

party  by  suddenly  entering  the  room  with  the  startling 
announcement  that  he  had  "  cub  to  play  teddis  with  Mr 
Jedkids,"  later  on  in  the  day  fairly  capped  his  own  best 
on  record  by  inviting  James  Walker  to  "  spid  "  !  "  Ichabod  " 
should  indeed  be  written  up  over  the  gates  of  Upton  ;  for 
if  the  archaeological  glories  of  the  old  Dower- House  still 
remain,  gone  are  our  popular  host  and  our  sympathetic 
hostess ;  gone  is  the  dog  Jack,  the  shrewdest  judge  of 
cricket ;  gone  is  Harding,  most  charming  of  stud-grooms, 
and  the  deftest  handler  of  spade  and  bucket  who  ever 
took  a  wasp's  nest  in  broad  daylight ;  gone,  alas  !  they  all 
are  to  lands  where  cricket  is  almost  unknown,  and  their 
like  we  can  hardly  hope  to  see  again. 

"  The  steed  is  vanished  from  the  stall ; 
No  serf  is  seen  in  Hassan's  hall ; 
The  lonely  spider's  thin  grey  pall 
Waves  slowly  widening  o'er  the  wall." 

So  far  as  Forester  cricket  is  cortcerned,  Upton  must  be 
accounted  as  a  relic  of  the  past :  a  future  it  is  impossible 
to  foresee.  Those  were  days  before  I  was  a  Forester ;  but 
most  of  the  Upton  party,  which  formed  the  nucleus  of  the 
sides  which  the  Foresters  encountered  on  the  three  grounds 
I  have  mentioned,  sooner  or  later  became  members  of  the 
old  Club.  Such  were  Frank  Cobden,  Harry  Maul,  James 
Walker,  Charlie  and  poor  Arthur  Cobb,  Clarence  Smith, 
Harry  Tubb,  and  Jinks  himself,  and  all  of  us  got  runs  on 
occasion,  and  we  won  more  matches  from  the  Free  Foresters' 
XI  than  we  lost  to  them.  But  though  many  of  our  side 
even  in  those  days  wore  Forester  colours,  there  was  no 
shifting  of  players  from  one  XI  to  the  other  by  way  of 
equalisation  of  strength ;  nor  did  Walter  Bovill,  who  got 
up  the  Club  team,  ever  unduly  trespass  on  the  home 
preserves. 

As  to  the  cricket,  there  is  no  need  to  go  far  afield  to 


298  MATCHES  IN  THE  MIDLANDS. 

search  for  incidents.  A  match  at  Middleton  in  those 
days  was  Hkely  to  afford  enough  incident  to  last  a  Hfe- 
time ;  and  the  cheery  cry  of  "  got  him/'  as  the  ball 
sounded  on  the  batsman's  ribs,  might  have  been  heard 
pretty  frequently.  If  we  bowlers  could  not  quite  say 
with  J.  C.  Shaw  that  we  put  the  ball  where  we  liked,  I 
doubt  if  after  it  had  once  pitched  on  a  real  old  Middleton 
plantain,  even  W.  G.  Grace  at  his  best  would  have  backed 
himself  to  grapple  with  its  subsequent  eccentricities.  That 
we  got  a  good  many  more  runs  than  far  stronger  sides 
could  get  on  Hegan's  ash-sown  wicket,  was  perhaps  due 
to  the  fact  that  we  have  become  a  little  ultra-civilised  in 
the  way  of  our  requirements  in  these  latter  days. 

"  Have  a  shot  at  them,  old  fellow,"  remarked  Jack  Dale, 
as  he  retired,  with  his  bat  behind  his  back,  in  the  direction 
of  short-leg  just  as  I  was  on  the  point  of  delivering  the 
ball ;  and  so  I  did,  but  I  missed  them.  Perhaps  George 
Willes  on  the  Forester  side  and  myself  on  the  other  got 
as  many  runs  as  most  people  at  Middleton,  nicety  of  cal- 
culation, not  being  quite  such  a  strong  point  with  either  of 
us  as  it  was  with  more  scientific  batsmen;  and  when  it  was 
odds  on  the  ball  hitting  the  body  if  it  missed  the  bat  or 
wicket,  to  shut  the  eyes  and  let  go  the  painter  was  sound 
policy.  However,  we  never  did  have  an  inquest  on  the 
ground,  and  we  got  plenty  of  amusement  out  of  the  game. 
I  cannot  conscientiously  say  that  either  Banbury  or  Ded- 
dington  was  exactly  a  bread-and-butter  wicket,  but  both 
were  so  atrociously  slow  that  there  was  a  less  exciting 
element  of  danger,  and  on  the  whole  I  vastly  preferred 
Middleton.  At  Banbury  one  year,  Teddy  Rutter  distin- 
guished himself  by  taking  the  ball  when  we  had  got  about 
80  for  no  wickets,  and  getting  rid  of  James  Walker,  a  Pigg 
(whether  it  was  H.  or  C.  is  still  an  open  question),  and 
Harry  Maul,  then  a  most  dangerous  bat,  in  six  balls,  and 
I  was  very  nearly  caught  from  a  rebound  off  the  opposite 


BICESTER.  299 

batsman's  hind-quarters  in  the  next  over.  I  remember 
Harry  Tubb  playing  a  fine  not-out  innings  of  just  100  in 
the  second  innings  on  a  very  muddy  wicket  at  Dedding- 
ton;  and  I  also  remember  that  gay  deceiver,  Walter  Bovill, 
considerately  borrowing  my  best  bat  for  the  express  pur- 
pose apparently  of  hitting  me  out  of  the  ground  with  it,  as 
I  bowled  the  first  ball  of  the  match.  And  to  this  day  I 
can  vividly  recall  the  piteous  expression  of  Holford  Risley's 
face,  when  he  had  rashly  asked  Jenkins  to  lend  him  a 
dancing  man  for  the  night  of  the  Deddington  ball,  and  on 
coming  up  to  the  ground  to  be  introduced  to  his  guest, 
found  that  he  was  expected  to  entertain  a  man  who  was 
at  the  moment  standing  upon  his  head  in  the  midst  of  the 
wreckage  of  furniture  which  he  had  created  just  outside 
what  was  to  be  the  ballroom. 

"  Oh,  is  that  the  young  gentleman } "  was  all  that  he 
said,  but  his  face  spoke  volumes. 

But  if  unkind  fate  has  decreed  that  the  Upton  week  is 
to  come  again  no  more,  it  is  a  matter  of  congratulation 
that  for  the  past  three  years  Forester  cricket  in  the  Ox- 
fordshire district  has  had  a  renaissance,  and  so  long  as 
those  keen  and  hospitable  supporters  of  the  game,  Harry 
Tubb  and  Charlie  Hoare,  reside  in  the  neighbourhood  of 
Bicester,  we  may  hope  that  there  are  good  days  in  store 
for  us,  and  that  good  yarns  may  be  reserved  for  a  future 
chronicler. 

The  matches  played  since  the  revival  have  been  most 
hotly  contested,  and  though  Atthill  and  Walter  Bovill 
managed  to  split  a  finger  apiece  at  Bicester  on  one  and 
the  same  day,  the  light,  not  the  ground,  was  responsible 
for  the  twin  mishaps.  If  results  proved  that  Harry  Tubb 
was  slightly  out  of  his  reckoning  when  he  informed  me  last 
year  at  Lord's  that  he  fancied  that  both  Bicester  and 
Bignell  would  beat  the  Foresters,  either  match  took  a 
good  deal  of  winning,  and  the  only  thing  that  marred  the 


300  MATCHES  IN   THE  MIDLANDS. 

enjoyment  of  the  four  days'  cricket  was  the  fact  that  the 
temporary  disablement  of  Tubb  himself  deprived  the  home 
XI  of  a  still  more  than  serviceable  cricketer. 

There  must  be  something  very  rejuvenating  about  the 
climate  of  this  part  of  Oxfordshire.     For  either  at  Banbury, 
Middleton,  Deddington,  or  Bicester  successive  generations 
of  Free  Foresters  have  had  the  pleasure  of  encountering 
that   genial   old    cricketer    Edward,   or,   as    he    is    more 
commonly  called,  "Wash"   Ramsay  of  Croughton,   who 
has  belonged  to  the  Club  from  its  very  earliest  beginning, 
and  playing  on  one  side  or  the  other,  has  taken  part  in  more 
F.  F.  matches  than  any  man  in  that  or  possibly  any  other 
district.     Not  only  has  "  Wash  "  with  ever  ready  hospitality 
opened  the  doors  of  his  house  at    Croughton   to   many 
Foresters  during  their  tours  in  Oxfordshire,  but  he  has 
probably  in  his  time  bowled  some  hundreds  of  them  out, 
and  is  quite  likely  to  perform  the  same  kind  office  for  some 
of  them  in  the  future.     There  were  few  more  dangerous 
bowlers  in  England  than  "  Wash  "  some  thirty  years  ago, 
and  even  now  on  his  day  he  wants  a  good  deal  of  watching, 
"^YvXq  per  contra  \i^  is  always  game  to  back  himself  for  a 
crown  to  make  his  ten  runs  against  any  bowling.     Another 
familiar  figure  in  the  same  district  is  that  of  the  chatty  and 
energetic  Rector  of  Middleton.     W.  H.  Draper  had,  I  fancy, 
already  taken  his  M.A.  degree  when  as  a  very  small  boy 
at  Radley  I  first  admired  his  brilliant  fielding ;  and  to  this 
day  he  can  still  hold  a  hot  catch,  steal  a  short  run,  or  take 
as  well  as  talk  more  than  his  fair  share  in  a  long  day's 
outing  better  than  a  good  many  cricketers  belonging  to  a 
generation  which  was  yet  unborn  when  he  was  in  his  prime. 
To  that  despairing  philosopher,  who  has  already  in  his  own 
mind  settled  upon  the  age  of  forty,  or  it  may  be  even  an 
earlier  date,  as  the  "  fixed  period  "  for  giving  up  cricket  and 
taking  to  golf  or  some  other  form  of  gentle  exercise,  I  would 
prescribe  a  visit  to  the   Bicester  Country  and    a  match 


CHRISTCHURCH,   OXFORD.  301 

either  with  or  against  a  Bicester  XI,  in  the  hope  that  a 
couple  of  overs  from  "Wash"  Ramsay  or  half  an  hour's 
batting  with  Draper  as  a  partner  might  induce  him  to 
postpone  the  evil  day  for  yet  another  twenty  years. 

I  had  almost  forgotten  to  mention  that  a  very  pleasant 
match  has  been  for  the  last  eight  years  played  during  the 
summer  term  at  Oxford  against  Christchurch.  The 
Forester  Elevens  have  been  got  up  by  H.  Tubb,  and  he 
has  often  put  a  very  strong  side  into  the  field  ;  but,  strange 
to  say,  only  one  match  of  the  whole  series  has  been  finished, 
and  that  resulted  in  the  defeat  of  the  Foresters.  Drawn 
games  are  of  frequent  occurrence  on  the  "  House  "  ground, 
owing  to  the  excellence  of  the  wicket,  and  owing  partly 
also  to  the  unfortunate  fact  that  the  summer  team  may 
too  often  be  entitled  the  Oxford  "Monsoon."  However, 
any  match  under  the  auspices  of  one  of  the  most  popular 
captains  of  the  present  or  any  era  of  Free  Forester  cricket 
is  likely  to  retain  its  attractiveness  in  the  face  of  far  more 
untoward  circumstances.  I  have  not  been  specially  retained 
to  sing  the  praises  of  individual  members  of  the  Club,  but 
the  general  effect  of  Harry  Tubb's  residence  in  the  district 
upon  the  tone  of  the  local  cricket  has  been  little  short  of 
remarkable,  and  can  only  be  fully  appreciated  by  those  who 
have  played  in  the  Bicester  country. 

In  his  picturesque  house,  Thornby  Hall,  lying  on  the 
borders  of  Warwickshire  and  Northants,  the  county  of 
spires  and  squires,  Mr  Pender,  a  Forester  of  some  years' 
standing,  for  several  seasons  hospitably  entertained  a  Club 
XI  which  played  two  or  three  matches  in  the  district. 
These  matches  were  generally  managed  by  C.  Farmer, 
under  whose  auspices  a  fairly  strong  side  encountered 
the  Gentlemen  of  Leicestershire  and  either  the  Gentlemen 
of  Northants  or  the  County  XL  A  good  many  drawn 
games  were  played,  and  now  and  again  the  F.  F.  got  by 
no  means  the  best  of  the  deal.     But  in  1893,  the  last  year 


302  MATCHES  IN  THE  MIDLANDS. 

in  which  the  matches  figured  on  our  programme,  a 
decidedly  strong  Forester  XI,  the  mustering  whereof 
a  chapter  of  accidents  rendered  anything  but  a  sinecure, 
easily  beat  a  weak  amateur  side  at  Lutterworth,  and  on 
the  two  following  days  won  the  match  against  Northants 
Club  and  ground  in  an  innings  with  some  runs  to  spare. 
Both  matches  were  finished  early  on  the  second  day, 
results  partly  attributable  to  the  fact  that  in  neither  case 
was  the  wicket  quite  unexceptionable. 

At  Lutterworth  the  turf  was  rather  of  the  slow  and 
sticky  order ;  at  Northampton,  on  the  other  hand,  it  was 
rather  a  fast  and  a  decidedly  fiery  wicket ;  and  at  both 
places  the  ball  wanted  a  good  deal  of  watching.  We  had 
on  our  side  a  fast  bowler  of  some  repute,  who — I  trust 
the  '  Lancet '  will  not  review  our  book — had  been  strictly 
forbidden  by  his  doctor  to  bowl.  He  kept  the  spirit,  if 
he  somewhat  transgressed  the  letter,  of  the  law,  as  he  only 
went  on  occasionally  for  a  couple  of  overs  when  the  bowl- 
ing was  in  a  knot.  And  he  invariably  brought  about  a 
dissolution  of  partnership  between  the  batsmen  ;  but,  by 
way  of  keeping  on  good  terms  with  the  doctor,  begged 
that  his  name  might  not  appear  on  the  score-sheet  as  a 
bowler.  There  was  a  good  deal  of  competition  for  the 
credit  of  those  wickets,  and  the  claims  put  forward  were 
in  many  cases  ingenious.  The  bewilderment  of  the 
scorers  when  they  were  informed  that  one  and  the  same 
man,  when  he  was  bowling,  was  sometimes  Curteis  and 
sometimes  Bovill,  but  when  he  was  batting  was  quite 
another  person  altogether,  may  be  more  easily  imagined 
than  described.  I  must  apologise  for  thus  giving  away 
the  two  great  bowlers  I  have  mentioned  ;  but  as  it  occasion- 
ally happened  that  one  or  other  of  them  was  nominally 
bowling  at  both  ends,  the  analysis  must  have  been  rather 
a  curiosity.  At  Northampton  Curteis  proved  in  more 
ways  than  one  that  his  heart  is  always  in  the  right  place,

as  after  receiving  a  very  severe  blow  in  that  region  early 
in  his  innings,  he  stuck  to  his  guns  manfully,  and  helped 
Walkenshaw  to  put  on  a  hundred  before  the  first  wicket 
fell.  While  the  latter  was  batting,  an  old  gentleman  in- 
formed me  that  no  one  had  ever  hit  into  the  pavilion  from 
the  middle  of  the  ground,  whereupon,  by  way  of  giving  my 
informant  the  pleasure  of  a  new  sensation,  Walkenshaw 
kindly  performed  the  feat  twice  in  the  same  over.

No  account  of  Free  Forester  cricket  in  the  past  few 
years  would  be  complete  without  something  more  than 
a  passing  reference  to  the  matches  played  at  Newbold 
Revel.  Thanks  to  Arthur  Wood's  unfailing  hospitality, 
the  Newbold  Revel  cricket-ground  has  become  a  highly 
favoured  resort  of  a  goodly. throng  of  amateur  cricketers, 
and  the  scene  of  many  a  keen  encounter.  There  Butter- 
flies, Eton  Ramblers,  Free  Foresters,  and  many  other 
clubs  have  assembled  to  fight  their  friendly  battles,  and 
neither  on  the  cricket-ground  nor  before  or  after  the  day's

play  need  any  one  find  the  time  hang  heavy  on  his  hands. 
It  is  not  given  to  many  places  to  combine  so  many  forms 
of  outdoor  amusement.    A  plunge  in  the  ample  swimming- 
bath,  trout-fishing,  rabbit-shooting,  lawn-golf,  squash  rack- 
ets are  all  included  in  the  programme  ;  and  those  unappre- 
ciated mortals,  like  Jeff  Maynard,  who  have  been  pining  to 
bowl  all  day  and  yet  never  put  on,  are  allowed  to  try  their 
hands  at  lawn-bowls  in  the  evening,  and,  by  the  deadly 
accuracy  of  their  aim,  vindicate  their  reputation  as  straight 
if  not  dangerous  bowlers.     If  it  did  so  happen  that  Gunner 
Curteis  was  so  unreasonably  startled  by  the  sudden  appari- 
tion of  a  black  rabbit  between  his  feet  as  he  was  ferreting 
with  the  keeper  at  an  early  hour  in  the  morning,  and  so 
much  upset  thereby  that  he  not  only  dropped  catches  and 
made  ducks  for  the  rest  of  the  day,  but  is  even  credited 
with  having  for  the  first  time  in  his  cricket  career  tempor- 
arily lost  his  temper  and  instituted  comparisons  between  a 
brother  Forester  and  an  unclean  animal ;  and  even  though 
to  this  day  it  is  darkly  hinted  that  Rawlin  shot  a  pheasant 
out  of  season, — the  presence  of  a  plurality  of  pursuits  is  a 
distinct  and  most  attractive  feature  of  the  place,  and  neither 
host  nor  captain  can  be  held  responsible  for  the  eccentrici- 
ties of  individual  cricketers.     Very  pleasant  has  a  stay  at 
Newbold  Revel  been  in  the  days  of  Mr  Wood's  bachelor- 
hood, and  there  is  good  ground  for  hoping  that  the  advent 
of  a  wife  upon  the  scene  of  action,  so  far  from  diminishing 
the  popularity  of  the  Newbold  weeks,  will  rather  tend  to 
add  to  those  charming  surroundings  one  attraction  that 
has  been  missing  in  the  past,  a  gallery  of  fair  spectators. 
For  even  in  this  prosaic  and  matter-of-fact  age  the  "  love 
of  ladies"  and  the  knowledge  that  "fair  eyes  look  upon 
their  deeds"  is  an  additional  incentive  for  distinguishing 
themselves  to  many  men  whom  nature  obviously  intended 
to  play  up  to  a  gallery.     Here  and  there  I  have  heard  a 


CANDELABRUM    PRESENTED    TO    MR    WOOD 
ON    HIS    MARRIAGE, 


ARTHUR   WOOD,  313 

jealous  or  crusty  bachelor,  whose  idea  has  been  that  Para- 
dise was  not  quite  the  same  place  after  Eve  was  admitted, 
suggest  that  the  master  of  Newbold  was  full  young  to 
marry  ;  but  the  suspicions  of  even  the  most  confirmed 
woman-hater  have  been  allayed  by  the  hearty  interest 
taken  by  Mrs  Arthur  Wood  in  the  cricket  programme  for 
the  season  of  1894. 

To  the  young  and  active  cricketer,  as  well  as  conservative 
old  fossils  of  my  own  type,  the  cricket-ground  with  its 
"  six "  boundary,  and  the  constant  extra  strain  on  the 
powers  of  endurance,  may  be  said  to  realise  an  ideal  else- 
where sought  for  in  vain ;  and  if  to  a  wearied  bowler  the 
perfect  wicket  may  seem  rather  to  favour  the  batsman,  the 
former,  when  the  scoring  rules  high,  may  at  least  console 
himself  with  the  idea  that  he  is  not  by  any  means  mono- 
polising the  real  hard  work,  as  is  too  frequently  the  case 
where  the  boundaries  are  smaller.  There  are  plenty  of 
runs  to  be  got  at  Newbold  Revel,  but  the  spectacle  of  a 
comparatively  fresh  batsman  hitting  a  succession  of  4's, 
and  landing  the  ball  high  in  the  air  just  over  the  ropes,  is 
conspicuously  and  necessarily  absent,  and  any  one  who 
can  hit  out  of  that  ground  honestly  deserves  his  6  and  his 
brief  rest.  The  finest  hit  I  have  ever  seen  at  Newbold 
myself  was  made  by  Arthur  Wood  in  a  Forester  match 
against  a  local  team  last  July,  when  the  ball  pitched  ten 
yards  over  the  railings  to  square-leg ;  and  Asher  created  a 
record  hard  to  beat  when  he  made  27  off  one  over  in  the 
second  innings  of  our  match  against  Shropshire  County. 
The  runs  were  scored  as  follows  :  6,  6,  6,  4,  5  ;  and  as  the 
fourth  ball  was  hit  to  the  on -boundary,  it  was  honestly 
worth  6,  but  had,  unfortunately,  in  its  course  passed  under 
a  seat,  one  of  the  only  two  4  boundaries  on  the  ground, 
and  6  might  easily,  but  for  a  misunderstanding,  have  been 
run  for  the  last  ball  of  this  sensational  over.     The  bowler 


314  MATCHES  IN  THE  MIDLANDS. 

was  not  in  the  slightest  degree  put  out  by  the  rough  usage 
that  he  had  received,  but  informed  me  that  he  had  been 
hit  for  26  in  an  over  a  few  weeks  previously.  In  1892 
A.  J.  Thornton  took  36  wickets  in  a  week,  but  last  year 
(1893),  when  the  ground  was  very  hard,  he  was  freely  hit 
by  the  Oxford  Authentics,  who  beat  us  in  an  innings. 

"Let  me  have  one  more  over,  Spens,"  he  pleaded,  on 
our  Captain  hinting  that  a  change  was  imminent.  "  I'm 
sure  that  Punch  is  not  at  all  at  home  with  me." 

So  he  was  allowed  that  one  more  over,  and  Punch 
Philipson,  by  way  of  proving  that  he  really  was  "  not  at  all 
at  home"  with  A.  J.,  scored  17  off  the  first  four  balls. 
But  to  this  day  A.  J.  thinks  that  he  should  have  got  him 
if  he  had  gone  on.  However,  we  none  of  us  got  much 
change  out  of  Punch  that  day,  as,  after  being  badly  missed 
early  in  his  innings,  he  knocked  all  our  bowling  about  to 
the  tune  of  130.  For  us  Hornsby  played  a  good  innings  ; 
but  taking  it  all  round,  our  batting  was  feeble  in  the 
extreme.  Hornsby  has  played  several  good  innings  on 
the  Newbold  ground,  but  has  notably  failed  in  the  bowling 
line.  Blair,  Ricketts,  and  Walter  Bovill  have  also  been 
large  scorers,  and  our  host  has  hit  hard  on  more  than  one 
occasion.  As  very  much  the  same  lot  of  cricketers  have 
been  playing  at  different  times  as  Free  Foresters,  Butter- 
flies, or  the  Newbold  Revel  Club,  which  numbers  upwards 
of  120  paying  members,  it  is  rather  difficult  in  the  absence 
of  the  scoring-book  to  recall  in  which  particular  colours 
any  individual  has  been  successful.  That  the  Foresters 
may  have  many  more  pleasant  matches  at  Newbold  is  the 
wish  dear  to  the  hearts  of  all  of  us  that  have  played  there. 

For  a  year  or  two  the  Foresters,  under  my  guidance, 
strayed  back  to  what  was,  if  I  am  not  mistaken,  the  orig- 
inal home  of  the  club,  the  Forest  of  Arden.  At  Fillongley 
Hall,  at  Meriden,  and  elsewhere,  we  met  with  abundant 


ME  RID  EN.  315 

hospitality,  and  our  best  thanks  are  due  to  Arden  Adderley, 
Cliarles  Digby,  and  others,  for  the  kindly  welcome  which 
they  extended  to  us.  Nor  could  any  one  wish  to  visit  a 
more  beautiful  country  than  that  district,  which  claims  to 
be  the  very  centre  of  England.  If  it  was  not  destined  that, 
to  Ricketts'  inquiring  eye,  the  magic  name  Rosalind  should 
be  revealed,  we  were  quite  prepared  to  believe  that  Rosa- 
lind and  Celia,  as  well  as  Orlando  and  Oliver,  found  in  the 
Forest  of  Arden  many  a  pretty  spot  obviously  designed  by 
nature  for  love-making.  But  if  we  were  fain  to  admire  the 
quaintly  picturesque  beauty  of  the  old  archery-ground  at 
Meriden,  a  brief  experience  taught  us  that  it  by  no  means 
follows  that  a  good  ground  for  archery  need  be  a  good 
ground  for  cricket,  or  that  the  man  who  can  drop  an  arrow 
into  the  clout  is  thereby  constituted  a  formidable  opponent 
in  the  cricket-field.  The  wicket  was  slower,  I  think,  than 
any  wicket  I  ever  played  on,  the  out- fielding  in  many 
places  impossible,  and  the  lights  and  shadows  on  the 
ground  at  certain  times  of  the  day  most  baffling.  We 
won  our  matches  each  year,  and  on  one  occasion  Gillman 
made  100  by  some  really  brilliant  hitting.  But  by  far 
the  most  interesting  match  that  we  played  in  that  district, 
from  a  cricket  point  of  view,  was  against  Hugh  Rother- 
ham's  XI  at  Coventry ;  and  though,  after  declaring  our 
second  innings  over,  we  won  rather  easily  at  the  finish, 
they  had  headed  us  by  some  50  runs  in  the  first  innings. 
Hard  hitting  was  the  order  of  the  day  in  the  latter  part  of 
our  second  innings ;  and  as  a  hard  hitter,  under  those  cir- 
cumstances, I  can  confidently  recommend  Harry  Bagot,  to 
whom  nothing  in  the  way  of  pitch  or  pace  seemed  to  come 
amiss.  Much  to  be  condoled  with  was  the  man  Caldwell, 
who,  having  travelled  some  hundreds  of  miles  to  play  that 
week  for  the  Foresters,  split  his  finger  in  a  local  match  at 
Meriden  on  the  day  before  the  Forester  cricket  began,  and

finding  himself  absolutely  incapacitated,  returned  to  Scot- 
land in  disgust.  We  had  a  match  against  the  Gentlemen 
of  Staffordshire  at  Lichfield  each  year ;  but  the  weather 
spoilt  both  games,  and  a  more  bleak  place  on  a  cold  and 
rainy  day  than  that  Lichfield  ground  would  be  hard  to 
find  in  the  whole  of  England.  Gillman  and  John  Ricketts 
caused  a  little  amusement  while  they  were  in  together  one 
second  innings — the  former,  who  had  taken  o  at  the  first 
time  of  asking,  not  evincing  the  slightest  anxiety  to  save 
his  spectacles,  and  failing  altogether  to  respond  to  the  self- 
sacrificing  efforts  of  his  partner  to  run  some  rather  short 
things.  Eventually,  after  playing  for  some  four  overs  with- 
out attempting  to  run,  Gillman  hit  out  finely,  and  made  50 
in  very  quick  time.  Here  let  me  relate  a  rather  curious 
coincidence  which  happened  in  a  Forester  match  with 
the  Green-jackets  at  Winchester.  Against  a  rather  weak 
bowling  side,  John  Ricketts,  going  in  first,  had  elected,  in 
the  most  unfeeling  manner,  to  knock  up  a  century,  and 
had  rather  taken  the  gilt  off  the  gingerbread  for  the  rest  of 
us.  However,  we  made  a  good  many  runs,  and  after  they 
had  had  to  follow  on  we  were  left  with  only  9  to  get  in 
order  to  win  the  match.  Two  champions,  of  whom  Frank 
Gresson  was  one  and,  I  fancy,  either  Pember  or  Bobby 
Skipwith  the  other,  having  failed  to  score  in  the  first 
innings,  w^ere  naturally  given  the  chance  of  bagging  their 
brace.  After  prolonging  the  excitement  for  quite  a  quarter 
of  an  hour,  and  after  each  had  had  several  hairbreadth 
escapes,  they  returned  to  the  pavilion  in  triumph,  each 
having  scored  o — each  being  "  not  out,"  but  having  secured 
9  extras.  And  I  had  almost  forgotten  to  chronicle  that 
when  4  runs  were  required  in  the  second  innings  of  our 
match  against  the  Old  Carthusians  at  Newbold  Revel  last 
year,  we  commenced  operations  by  losing  3  wickets  for 
no  runs,  with  the  result  that  one,  if  not  two,  distinguished

CHAPTER    XXXV. 


CHANNEL  ISLANDS. 


It  only  remains  for  me  to  record  how  in  1890  the 
Channel  Islands  were  formally  re-occupied  by  the.  Free 
Foresters.  Rumours  having  reached  the  secretary  of  the 
disaffected  state  of  these  islands,  he  commissioned  me  to 
take  charge  of  an  expedition,  and  having  effected  a  land- 
ing, we  defeated  the  forces  of  Guernsey  and  Jersey  in 
several  encounters.  In  fact,  the  news  of  our  victory  in 
Guernsey  must  have  preceded  our  arrival  in  the  other 
island,  as  we  found  great  preparations  made  to  illuminate 
St  Heliers  on  the  day  of  our  landing.  To  be  sure,  some- 
body did  say  something  about  unveiling  a  statue  of  her 
Gracious  Majesty ;  but  by  the  time  that  we  had  drunk  a 
couple  of  glasses  of  the  South  Lancashire  regimental  mix- 
ture, we  were  quite  prepared  to  regard  such  rumours  as 
a  mere  canaj-d  (the  recollection  of  the  Channel  Islands 
inspires  the  French).  And  is  it  not  a  recorded  fact  that 
on  the  occasion  of  our  second  visit,  the  customary  tokens 
of  submission — not  bread  and  salt  as  in  the  East,  but  a 
local  cheese  and  part  of  a  gammon  of  bacon  from  a  local 
pig  —  were  duly  presented  to  us  by  the  Victoria  Club 
waiter  with  the  Governor's  compliments. 

Without  further  preface  I  will  give  as  briefly  as  possible 
the  outlines  of  the  campaign.    From  the  very  outset  I  found 


HECKLED.  319 

that  I  should  have  no  difficulty  in  getting  together  an  XI 
or  a  XXII  if  necessary,  and  the  fact  that  we  eventually 
started  with  only  ten  men  was  due  to  the  unfortunate  cir- 
cumstance of  Atthill  splitting  a  finger  on  the  day  before  the 
voyage,  and  hoping  against  hope  that  his  medical  adviser 
would  not  put  a  veto  on  his  going.  The  monotony  of  the 
long  night-journey  from  London  to  Weymouth  was  suffi- 
ciently relieved  by  Ingram's  cheery  conversation.  Ingram's 
merits  as  an  all-round  athlete  are  too  well  known  to  require 
any  encomium  ;  as  a  conversationalist  he  is  simply  inde- 
fatigable, and  as  a  cross-examiner  equal  to  Sergeant  Buz- 
fuz  in  his  best  day,  while  his  stock  of  general  information 
is  inexhaustible.  The  following  will  serve  as  a  specimen 
of  his  powers  : — 

/.  "  What  time  do  we  reach  Weymouth  ?  " 

C.  "  Somewhere  about  two." 

/.  "  Oh,  then,  you  don't  know  exactly  ?  " 

C.  "  No,  not  exactly." 

/.  "Well,  it  happens  to  be  1.50." 

C.  "  Well,  I  wasn't  far  out." 

/.  "You  were  ten  minutes  out."  Then,  after  a  pause, 
"And  how  soon  does  the  boat  leave?" 

C.  "  Oh,  at  once,  I  suppose." 

/.  "  But  you  don't  know  for  certain  }  " 

C.  "  No,  I  don't." 

/.  "  Couldn't  you  have  wired  to  ask  t  " 

C.  "  Well,  I'm  afraid  I  did  not  think  it  worth  while." 

/.  "Don't  you  think  that,  as  a  rule,  it  is  worth  while 
to  make  certain  } "  &amp;c.,  &amp;c. 

I  have  quite  made  up  my  mind  at  some  future  date  to 
offer  myself  for  election  in  an  outlying  constituency,  and 
to  get  Ingram  to  "  heckle "  my  opponent. 

Our  passage  through  the  streets  of  Weymouth  to  the 
boat  afforded  "  Bishop "  Kemp  unmitigated  satisfaction, 
and  he  yelled  directions  out  of  the  window  to  the  engine-

driver  to  draw  up  at  the  butcher's  shop,  or  to  have  an 
easy  at  the  confectioner's. 

A  sort  of  vault  with  some  beds  or  berths  in  it  was  put  at 
the  disposal  of  the  team  ;  but  the  "  Bishop,"  Jack  Turner, 
and  Kenneth  M'Alpine  were  so  uncommonly  lively,  and 
there  was  such  a  promising  preparation  for  a  stupendous 
bear-fight,  that  the  more  serious  members  of  the  party 
adjourned  to  the  deck  and  slept  there.  Personally  I 
slumbered  peacefully  till  8  A.M.,  when  I  was  awakened 
by  the  "  Bishop  "  shouting  frantically  for  the  steward.  That 
functionary  hurried  to  our  vault  with  the  paraphernalia 
generally  in  requisition  on  these  occasions,  but  was 
promptly  repulsed  by  the  "  Bishop."  "  What  the  dickens 
are  you  bringing  that  rubbish  here  for }  Go  and  tell  the 
captain  that  I  want  my  sea-legs." 

This  was  received  with  a  stifled  scream  of  laughter  from 
the  ladies'  cabin,  and  a  grunt  from  the  outraged  steward. 
Shortly  afterwards  our  whole  party  assembled  on  deck, 
looking  none  the  worse  for  their  night's  voyage,  but  feel- 
ing uncommonly  peckish.  There  was  a  cheerful  unanimity 
in  the  response  "  Not  out ! "  given  to  a  sudden  inquiry, 
"  How's  that } "  emanating  from  a  stout  party  in  brass 
buttons  standing  on  the  bridge.  He  looked  angry,  but 
there  was  really  no  apparent  ground  for  the  appeal. 

We  landed  on  a  Sunday  morning,  and  on  the  afternoons 
of  Monday  and  Tuesday  played  a  match  against  a  com- 
bined team  of  soldiers  and  civilians,  whom  we  defeated 
in  an  innings,  and  on  Wednesday  proceeded  to  Jersey.  In 
the  evening  we  scaled  the  heights  and  watched  the  illumina- 
tions from  the  fort,  where  we  were  cordially  welcomed  by 
the  South  Lancashire  Regiment,  and  it  was  then  that  we 
made  our  first  acquaintance  with  the  aforesaid  "  regimental 
mixture,"  a  beverage  fit  for  the  gods.  On  the  two  follow- 
ing days  we  played  a  match  with  our  gallant  entertainers 
on  a  truly  sporting  ground.     The  wicket  was  of  a  some-

what  fiery  order  :  a  tent  was  the  only  recognised  boundary, 
but  a  hospital,  a  mess-room,  a  corn-field,  a  precipice,  and 
a  camp  were  tempting  marks  for  a  hard  hitter.  Teddy 
Buckland,  who  elected  to  bowl  without  a  long-leg,  was  hit 
prodigiously  hard  in  that  direction.  His  elder  brother 
was  the  unlucky  short-leg,  and,  as  he  commenced  to  pur- 
sue the  ball,  which  travelled  merrily  over  a  morass  and 
along  a  hard  and  gritty  road,  with  more  perseverance  than 
speed,  had  the  presence  of  mind  to  ejaculate,  "  Back  me 
up,  some  one  ! " 

Fieldsman  after  fieldsman  responded  to  the  appeal,  with 
the  result  that  cover-point  and  two  outfields  v/ere  left  to 
watch  the  pleasing  spectacle  of  seven  men,  with  the 
"  Bishop,"  gloves  and  all,  bringing  up  the  rear,  toiling  after 
the  ball.  How  many  were  run  for  that  hit  I  forget,  but  I 
have  a  distinct  recollection  of  Jack  Turner's  last  ball  for 
the  season  of  1891  being  hit  by  Easby  for  9  in  very 
much  the  same  direction.  We  finished  ofif  match  No.  I. 
before  luncheon  on  the  second  day,  and  the  weather  being 
too  lovely  to  be  wasted,  at  once  started  a  return,  in  which, 
being  set  to  make  rather  under  100  to  win,  we  knocked 
them  off  in  twenty-nine  minutes  by  the  clock.  On  the 
Saturday  we  played  the  Island  on  the  Victoria  College 
ground,  where  Ingram  brought  off  a  sensational  catch  close 
to  the  boundary.  Here  again  the  wicket  was  somewhat 
dangerous,  one  gentleman's  life  being  only  saved  by  the 
stoutness  of  his  straw-hat ;  and  the  captain  of  the  opposi- 
tion had  to  be  frequently  encouraged  by  the  Bishop  "  to 
stand  up  to  his  guns,"  as  the  balls  whizzed  past  his  ears. 
This  match,  like  its  predecessors,  we  won  easily.  We  had 
a  most  festive  dinner  one  night  at  the  Fort,  on  which 
occasion  Walter  Bovill  fairly  frightened  our  entertainers 
by  turning  somersaults  over  chairs  in  the  small  hours  of 
the  night ;  and  it  was  on  the  morning  after  that  dinner 
that  I  had  the  pleasure  of  personally  conducting  a  nautical

expedition,  consisting  of  the  Bishop,  Mid  Kemp,  M'Alpine, 
and  Walter  Bovill.  There  was  plenty  of  wind,  which 
materially  affected  the  comfort  of  the  latter  trio,  who  were 
all  ill  at  intervals,  but  were  kindly  nursed  by  the  "  Bishop," 
who  played  the  part  of  steward  to  perfection,  and  obligingly 
passed  up  the  green  slugs,  intended  for  bait,  to  be  inspected 
by  any  temporary  convalescent.  The  mal  de  mer  took 
Kenneth  M'Alpine  in  a  peculiar  form,  and  he  reminded 
me  much  of  Mr  Squeers,  his  groans  and  gasps  tending  to 
the  "  'arrowing  belief  that  he  had  received  some  injury  in 
his  inside." 

Eventually,  after  eating  an  abnormal  quantity  of  figs 
and  grapes,  talking  more  bad  French  than  could  be 
imagined,  and  drinking  much  excellent  champagne  at 
somewhere  about  half  the  cost  of  an  inferior  brand  in 
England,  we  returned  to  Weymouth,  and  notwithstanding 
the  sea  passage  commenced  a  match  immediately  on  our 
arrival,  and  finished  it  in  our  favour  in  the  afternoon  of 
the  second  day.  I  have  omitted  to  record  how  Walter 
Bovill  so  wofully  frightened  a  cow  on  the  fort  cricket- 
ground  in  Jersey  that  he  nearly  drove  the  unhappy  animal 
to  commit  suicide.  Peeler  Buckland  and  myself  com- 
manded an  excellent  view  of  the  proceedings,  and  a  very 
funny  sight  it  was.  The  cow,  tethered  after  the  manner 
of  Jersey  cows,  was  sedulously  grazing  her  way  up  one 
side  of  a  big  grass  mound,  and  we  presently  saw  Walter, 
for  want  of  a  better  occupation,  divest  himself  of  his  coat, 
and  so  deftly  time  a  laborious  walk  on  all-fours  up  the 
other  side  that  his  nose  almost  encountered  the  cow's  at 
the  apex  of  the  mound.  Walter  burst  out  laughing,  but 
the  cow  was  so  startled  at  the  apparition  that  she  smashed 
her  tether-rope  and  bolted  after  the  manner  of  the  Gadarene 
swine  down  a  steep  place,  with  a  settled  resolution  to  drown 
herself,  a  calamity  which  only  Ingram's  activity  averted. 
From  our  position  we  thought  it  was  a  "  gone  "  cow,  and 


A   NOVEL  MATCH.  323 

were  much  relieved  when  we  saw  it  led  back  by  our 
athletic  cross-examiner. 

In  1 89 1  a  good  many  of  the  original  side  again  made 
the  passage.  Wet  and  cold  weather  rather  marred  the 
pleasure  of  the  first  part  of  the  trip  ;  but  the  weather  in 
Jersey  was  bright  and  warmer,  I  think,  than  any  part  of 
the  summer.  We  started  by  playing  Weymouth ;  but,  in 
the  absence  of  "  Bishop  "  Kemp,  Jack  Turner,  and  Walter 
Bovill,  were  soundly  beaten  twice  over.  The  ground  cut 
up  badly,  and  we  had  all  the  worst  of  the  wicket,  but  the 
amount  of  catches  dropped  was  abnormal.  In  Guernsey 
we  had  a  bit  the  best  of  a  match  played  in  a  strong  north- 
east wind,  which  chilled  us  all  to  the  very  bone,  so  that 
the  game  was  stopped  by  mutual  consent.  Some  half- 
dozen  of  our  side  had  been  conveyed  from  Weymouth 
in  the  yacht  Roseneath — at  that  time  owned  by  A.  W. 
Fulcher — and  we  had  a  most  cheery  voyage,  notwithstand- 
ing a  little  sea-sickness.  If  we  had  been  unable  to  beat  the 
Guernsey  folk  at  cricket,  Walter  Bovill  carried  off  for  the 
time  being,  at  all  events,  the  honours  of  an  encounter  with 
the  Major  of  the  regiment  quartered  in  the  island.  We 
had  been  most  kindly  welcomed  by  the  Mess,  who,  in 
addition  to  showing  us  much  hospitality,  had  pressed  us 
to  dine  on  the  last  night  of  our  stay.  But  visions  of  an 
early  start  induced  a  change  of  programme,  and  we  event- 
ually persuaded  as  many  members  of  the  Mess  as  we  could 
get  hold  of  to  dine  at  our  hotel  instead.  After  dinner  we 
all  adjourned  to  the  Club,  and  it  was  there  that  Walter 
Bovill  had  a  most  amusing  contest  with  one  of  our  guests. 

It  was  Joseph  Hill  who  made  the  match,  pitting  his 
Free  Forester  unknown  against  the  regimental  fancy. 
Whether  there  had  been  any  previous  argument  or  dis- 
cussion, that  I  know  not ;  this  only  do  I  know,  that  some- 
where about  midnight  to  the  smoking-room  of  the  Club 
there  penetrated — even  though   uttered   in   those   dulcet 


324  PRELIMINARIES. 

accents  for  which  Joseph  is  so  justly  famed — this  start- 
Hng  announcement,  "  Well,  I'll  back  a  fellow  on  our  side 
to  stand  on  his  head  against  any  man  on  yours."  Ye 
gods !  what  a  challenge,  and  that  when  most  of  us  were 
rather  inclined  to  doubt  our  capacity  for  standing  on  our 
feet,  let  alone  our  heads.  For  though  the  day  had  been 
cold  enough,  the  night  was  not  only  warm,  but  what  a 
Scotchman  would  call  "unco  drouthy."  I  myself  at  the 
moment  was  doing  my  best  to  make  small-talk  to  the 
two  senior  ofhcers  of  the  regiment, — my  best  was  not,  I 
fear,  very  successful,  as  both  my  guests  looked  sleepy, 
sleepier  of  the  pair  the  Major.  But  at  the  cry  he  started 
up,  and  then  might  be  seen,  as  Napier  puts  it,  "  with  what 
strength  and  majesty  the  British  soldier  fights,"  and  how 
"nothing  can  stop  that  astonishing  infantry."  For  that 
dark  drowsy  man  simply  bounded  from  his  seat  as  if  pro- 
pelled from  a  catapult,  and  ran  down-stairs  at  a  breakneck 
pace,  loudly  vociferating,  "  I'll  take  up  that  challenge  with 
any  man  living  ! " 

"  Well,  then,  Bovrill  is  my  man,"  announced  Joseph  ; 
and  in  the  hands  of  Bovrill,  or  Bovill — you  can  spell  it 
which  way  you  like — we  felt  that  the  honour  of  the  side 
was  safe.  For  had  it  not  been  recorded  of  Walter  Bovill 
that  on  one  occasion  he  had  dived  into  the  window  of  a 
train  in  motion  like  the  harlequin  in  the  pantomime  of  our 
childhood  would  vanish  into  a  post-box }  that  on  another 
occasion,  when  he  went  to  make  a  call,  his  hostess,  enter- 
ing the  drawing-room  with  her  company  smile,  discovered 
her  genial  visitor  sitting  cross-legged  on  the  top  of  the 
door?  Had  we  not  in  the  previous  year  v/ith  our  own 
eyes  seen  him  at  i  o'clock  A.M.  turn  a  somersault  over  four 
chairs,  to  the  astonishment  of  our  hosts  the  South  Lanca- 
shire Regiment,  and  to  the  evident  disappointment  of  his 
showman  Freddy  Capron,  who  had  apparently  calculated 
upon  his  breaking  his  neck  in  the  execution  of  this  per-

formance  ?  And  had  we  not  further  seen  him  in  ^Z^  pul- 
verise a  well-known  sporting  colonel  of  the  Royal  Engineers 
at  Chatham,  who  after  fairly  holding  his  own  in  cock-fight- 
ing, cavalry  tournaments,  and  other  gymnastic  displays, 
simply  declined  attempting  to  walk  round  the  anteroom 
on  his  hands  at  2  A.M. 

What  the  Englishman  is  to  other  whites,  what  a  Red 
Indian  is  to  an  Englishman,  what  an  ape  is  to  a  Red 
Indian,  what  an  orang-outang  is  to  other  apes,  that — 
had  Providence  seen  fit  to  make  him  an  orang-outang — 
would  Walter  Bovill  have  been  to  the  rest  of  his  species. 

Preliminaries  were  soon  settled.  Two  mats  were  brought 
out  into  the  hall ;  the  men  stripped  to  the  buff,  or  rather 
took  off  their  coats  and  waistcoats,  stood  face  to  face,  and 
at  a  given  signal  up  went — the  Major.  On  his  head,  with 
his  legs  upreared  straight  as  arrows,  stood,  motionless  as 
a  statue,  that  marvellous  man  for  the  space  of  fully  five 
minutes — stood  until  (it  was  really  quite  interesting  to 
watch)  all  the  blood  ran  into  his  head,  and  his  face  grew 
purple.  And  where  was  our  Walter  all  the  time  ?  Kneeling 
on  his  mat  with  a  quiet  smile  upon  his  face,  and  apparently 
trying  to  count  the  hairs  on  the  back  of  the  Major's 
head.  For  a  moment  there  was  a  dead  silence ;  then  as 
Foresters  and  guests  alike  entered  into  the  spirit  of  the 
thing,  uprose  a  mighty  babel  of  voices,  encouraging  now 
the  Simon  Pure,  now  the  impostor.  "  Bravo,  Walter ! 
stick  to  it ;  the  Major  is  tottering."  "  Good  old  Major ! 
hold  on  one  minute  more,  and  you'll  win  yet ! " 

And  right  gallantly  that  Major  held  on — his  face  was 
almost  black  now.  Six  minutes  passed  —  a  tremulous 
movement  in  his  legs  indicated  failing  power,  and  sud- 
denly he  came  down  with  a  run,  an  example  which  his 
adversary,  who  had  calculated  it  to  a  nicety,  and  mounted 
just  before  the  final  catastrophe,  followed  half  a  minute 
later. 


326  THE  FINALE. 

"  Well,"  exclaimed  the  Major,  as  soon  as  he  had  re- 
covered his  breath  sufficiently  to  make  himself  heard 
amidst  the  tumultuous  laughter  and  roars  of  applause 
which  greeted  both  performances,  "  I  really  had  no  idea 
that  any  one  else  could  stand  on  his  head  so  long.  Of 
course  I  could  have  gone  on  for  another  ten  minutes,  only 
I  thought  that  you  were  sure  to  be  down." 

"  Well,  so  could  I,  if  it  comes  to  that,"  retorted  the  un- 
blushing Walter  ;  "  but  I  heard  you  fall,  so  I  didn't  care  to 
go  on.     Anyhow,  you  are  much  more  pumped  than  I  am." 

By  our  guests'  advice  we  held  our  peace,  for  the  Major, 
they  warned  us,  was  a  bit  of  a  fire-eater,  and  it  was  thought 
that  the  harmony  of  the  evening  would  be  better  preserved 
if  he  were  left  in  blissful  ignorance  of  the  deceit  practised 
on  him.  So  at  the  time  we  allowed  him  to  return  to  his 
quarters,  a  somewhat  crestfallen  and  victimised  man.  But 
here  let  me  make  the  amende  honorable.  What  in  the 
matter  of  standing  on  the  head  Walter  Bovill  is  to  other 
Free  Foresters,  that,  and  something  more  than  that,  I 
firmly  believe  the  Major  to  be  to  Walter  Bovill. 

We  left  Guernsey  very  early  the  next  morning,  and 
were  again  most  cordially  welcomed  by  our  old  friends, 
the  40th  or  South  Lancashire  Regiment.  We  had  lovely 
weather,  amusing  cricket,  and  two  most  cheery  dinners, 
and  it  was  with  unfeigned  regret  that  we  found  that  that 
was  to  be  their  last  season  in  Jersey.  All  of  us  were 
sorry  to  take  leave  of  those  pretty  islands  ;  and  if  some 
of  the  party  were  abominably  ill  on  the  return  voyage, 
a  wise  minority  who  took  champagne  as  a  preventive 
can  look  back  upon  the  trip  with  a  conscience  void  of 
offence. 


Yacht  Rona, 


CHAPTER    XXXVI. 


1894. 


I  WILL  own  that  I  had  fondly  hoped  that  I  had  long 
since  written  my  last  chapter  in  the  F.  F.  book.  But  alas 
for  the  fallaciousness  of  human  expectations !  Another 
year  has  passed,  and  the  records  of  another  cricket  season 
have  been  added  to  my  labours. 

In  this  year  of  grace  1894  two  distinctly  new  departures 
in  the  way  of  Free  Forester  cricket  have  taken  place — i.e.^ 
the  cruise  of  the  yacht  Rona  and  an  Expedition  to  Ireland. 
If  I  cannot  with  a  clear  conscience  say  that  the  twelve 
brothers  of  our  order  who  were  privileged  to  sail  in  the 
Rona  one  and  all  proved  themselves  past  masters  in  the 
art  of  navigation,  it  did  not,  on  the  other  hand,  seem  as  if 


328  -      JERSEY  AND   GUERNSEY. 

temporary  fits  of  bodily  uneasiness  much  interfered  with 
thorough  enjoyment  of  the  excursion,  nor  did  the  awful 
amount  of  catches  that  were  dropped  weigh  deeply  upon 
the  offenders'  conscience.  For  men,  they  argued,  who 
were  night  after  night  tossed  upon  the  ocean  could  not 
be  expected  to  judge  catches  on  land  in  the  morning, 
and  it  was  clearly  the  bowlers'  business  to  hit  the  wicket. 
We  commenced  our  tour  with  a  match  against  a 
very  weak  Isle  of  Wight  side,  played  on  what  is  by 
courtesy  called  "The  County  Ground,"  near  ShankHn. 
In  our  second  innings  H.  G.  Tylecote  and  Ginger  Mor- 
daunt  each  took  a  hundred,  though  for  several  overs  it 
was  an  open  question  whether  the  latter  would  not  prefer 
the  distinction  of  spectacles.  Early  in  the  afternoon  of 
the  second  day  rain  effectually  stopped  further  play,  and 
the  match  was  left  drawn  considerably  in  our  favour. 
On  that  Saturday  night  we  made  tracks  for  Jersey,  but 
wind  and  tide  necessitated  a  change  of  route,  and  we 
found  ourselves  anchored  on  Sunday  morning  in  Cher- 
bourg Harbour.  Some  of  our  party  were  not  particularly 
clever  at  breakfast  that  day,  and  our  umpire  looked  as 
if  he  would  gladly  have  given  himself  "  out "  of  the  rest 
of  that  or  any  other  voyage.  A  quiet  morning  restored 
the  lost  appetites,  and  after  lunch  we  went  on  shore  and 
visited  the  fair,  where  Harry  Forster  distinguished  him- 
self by  performing  some  surprising  feats  of  strength  with 
a  beetle.  His  energy  was  not  allowed  to  pass  unre- 
warded. For  the  Amazon  who  ran  the  show  pinned  on 
his  breast  with  her  own  fair  hands  a  medallion  bear- 
ing an  appropriate  inscription.  Then,  in  order  to  prove 
that  there  was  really  no  deception,  the  lady  proceeded 
to  reproduce  the  feats  herself ;  but  albeit  that  this  un- 
called-for exhibition  rather  discounted  the  merits  of  his 
performance,  Forster  retained  possession  of  his  medallion, 
which  will  doubtless  remain  an  heirloom  in  the  family.

WEYMOUTH.  •  329 

We  reached  Jersey  on  the  following  morning,  and  on  a  soft 
wicket  easily  defeated  Colonel  Bruce's  XL 

A  wet  day  at  Guernsey  gave  ample  opportunity  for 
inspecting  the  capital  town  of  that  island,  and  we  found 
the  Island  side  so  unexpectedly  weak  that  a  single  day 
proved  ample  time  to  play  out  what  should  have  been 
a  two-days'  match.  We  declared  our  first  innings  over 
with  one  wicket  down  for  150,  and  disposed  of  our  op- 
ponents twice  for  an  aggregate  of  120.  The  one  re- 
markable incident  of  the  match  was  illustrative  of  the 
steadiness  of  the  British  Infantry  under  fire.  For  when 
Cranston  drove  a  ball  into  the  middle  of  the  regimental 
band,  more  than  one  member  of  which  was  for  the  moment 
in  imminent  bodily  peril,  they  never  faltered  in  their 
playing,  but  went  on  as  gaily  as  if  a  knock  from  a 
cricket -ball  was  a  matter  of  no  importance.  Some 
sporting  paper  laid  much  stress  on  the  fact  that  Le 
Mesurier  committed  suicide  by  knocking  down  his  own 
wicket  in  either  innings,  but  when  we  inspected  the  place 
where  he  took  guard  we  came  to  the  conclusion  that  it 
would  have  been  rather  a  matter  of  surprise  if  he  had  failed 
to  accomplish  his  weird  design. 

From  Guernsey  we  went  on  to  Weymouth,  and  then 
played  a  most  enjoyable  match  on  a  wicket  which  was 
not  only  very  true,  but,  considering  the  amount  of  rain 
that  had  fallen,  remarkably  fast.  Though  we  eventually 
won  somewhat  easily  by  8  wickets,  the  locals  were  by  no 
means  a  bad  side,  and  it  was  unfortunate  for  them  that 
one  of  their  soundest  batsmen  should  have  been  run  out 
in  each  innings  when  apparently  well  set.  For  them 
W.  H.  Mansfield  played  a  spirited  innings  for  70,  and 
their  professional,  Hughes,  bowled  well  and  steadily  from 
start  to  finish.  It  would  be  a  pity  if  a  match  at  Wey- 
mouth were  not  occasionally  to  figure  in  the  Forester 
programme  :  the  ground  is  good,  the  cricket  keen,  and  the 


330  IRELAND. 

place  most  attractive.     With  this  match  ended  our  most 
pleasant  tour. 

If  we  could  have  wished  that  the  cricket  in  the  Channel 
Islands  had  been  of  a  somewhat  higher  standard,  all  the 
arrangements  on  board  the  yacht  were  simply  perfect, 
and  when  I  say  that  Mr  M'Arthur  Wood  made  us  feel  as 
comfortable  and  as  much  at  home  as  we  have  always 
been  at  Newbold  Revel,  men  who  have  played  there  will 
readily  understand  that  Paradise  Row  was  no  inappropriate 
name  for  that  section  of  the  yacht  of  which  I  was  the  self- 
appointed  Commodore.  Ours  was  a  distinctly  strong  side, 
too  strong  of  course  for  most  of  the  teams  we  encountered  ; 
but  it  had  been  confidently  anticipated  that  the  effects  of 
the  sea-passages  would  equalise  matters  to  a  far  greater 
degree  than  was  the  case.  Ginger  Mordaunt  and  H.  G. 
Tylecote  came  out  with  prodigious  averages,  while  Boger, 
Leatham,  and  Harry  Forster  also  made  a  good  many 
runs.  Forster  and  Theo.  Wilson  were  the  most  success- 
ful bowlers,  but  most  of  us  had  on  occasion  a  turn  with 
the  ball.  Hanbury  kept  wicket  so  consistently  well  that 
Philipson's  services  were  not  called  into  requisition,  and 
the  latter  was  allowed  to  swell  the  ranks  of  the  change- 
bowlers.  In  this  capacity  Punch  met  with  some  success, 
and  I  have  it  on  the  best  authority — his  own — that  his 
fast  ball  is  especially  effective.  It  has  not  yet  been 
officially  decided  whether  the  Champion  Belt,  to  be  worn  by 
the  fieldsman  who  misses  most  catches  on  a  tour,  which  was 
long  and  worthily  held  by  Joe  Goldney,  and  in  the  season 
of  1893  passed  into  my  possession,  should  be  awarded  to 
Boger,  Gray  Tylecote,  or  Harry  Forster.  That  each  of 
them  has  strong  claims  in  his  favour  will  be  readily 
admitted  by  all  the  passengers  of  the  steam-yacht  Rona. 

The  other  new  feature  of  the  year  was  an   Irish  tour 
organised  and  personally  conducted  by  Frank  Sitwell  and 


IRISH  WEATHER.  331 

myself.  One  thing  only  was  wanting  to  make  it  a  com- 
plete success — i.e.,  fine  weather.  People  had  prophesied 
hard  things  to  us  about  the  weather  to  be  expected  in  Ireland 
during  August,  and  their  predictions  were  amply  fulfilled. 
Altogether  we  were  in  Ireland  for  twelve  days,  inclusive  of 
Sundays.  On  three  days  it  rained  almost  continuously ; 
on  three  we  really  had  something  like  summer  weather, 
with  bright  sunshine  and  blue  sky  —  but,  unfortunately 
for  our  cricket  aspirations,  two  of  these  latter  were  Sun- 
days. Some  of  our  party,  who  visited  Killarney  on  a 
Sunday,  seemed  inclined  to  congratulate  themselves  on 
having  secured  a  bright  day  for  their  expedition.  Per- 
sonally I,  who  had  gone  to  Ireland  to  play  cricket  rather 
than  look  at  scenery,  felt  aggrieved  that  so  fine  a  Sunday 
should  have  followed  three  impossible  working  days.  The 
remaining  six  days  may  be  briefly  described  as  muddy 
and  cloudy.  If  on  the  one  hand  there  was  no  rain,  on  the 
other  there  was  a  total  absence  of  sunshine,  with  the 
natural  result  that  the  wickets  after  the  excessive  rain 
were  too  slow  and  muddy  for  words. 

We  spent  a  very  fair  proportion  of  our  time  on  the 
railway,  and  twice  had  to  start  at  7  A.M.,  and  pass  on 
one  occasion  four,  on  the  other  six,  hours  in  the  train 
before  playing  cricket.  We  found  the  trains  neither  rapid 
nor  punctual,  and  when  every  other  expedient  for  spinning 
out  the  time  prescribed  by  Bradshaw  or  by  custom  failed, 
petty  officials  used  to  come  and  mutilate  our  tickets  or 
argue  with  Jeff  Maynard.  The  stationmasters  at  Dublin, 
Cork,  and  Limerick  were  extremely  courteous  and  ob- 
liging, but  many  of  the  understrappers  at  intermediate 
stations  we  found  very  much  the  reverse.  As  a  final 
steadier  of  the  nerves  before  going  in  to  bat,  I  can  con- 
fidently recommend  a  jaunt  on  an  outside  car  through 
crowded  streets  laid  with  tramway  lines  and  under  the 
auspices    of   a    slightly   elevated    Jehu.      Not    even    the 


332  RESULTS  IN  IRELAND, 

abominable  weather  or  the  lengthiness  of  the  journey 
could  make  our  visit  to  Cork  otherwise  than  pleasant. 
For  there  we  once  more  forgathered  with  our  old  friends 
the  South  Lancashire  Regiment,  and  were  for  three  days 
most  hospitably  entertained  by  them  and  the  York  and 
Lancaster,  who  were  quartered  in  the  same  barracks. 
Whether  a  supper  off  grilled  bones  and  poached  eggs, 
washed  down  by  Spiltzner  beer,  at  2  A.M.,  is  likely  to  be 
conducive  to  good  cricket  was  a  wholly  immaterial  ques- 
tion, as  the  only  cricket  played  by  the  F.  F.  at  Cork 
was  an  hour's  mud-larking  on  the  Saturday  afternoon. 

And  now  for  the  composition  of  the  team,  which  on 
the  evening  of  the  first  day  of  our  match  with  the  Vice- 
regal was  described  as  consisting  of  "  has  beens,"  "  never 
was's,"  and  fair-class  contemporaries.  I  am  not  at  all 
anxious  to  quarrel  with  this  description,  which,  if  uncompli- 
mentary, had  the  merit  of  being  fairly  accurate ;  but 
whereas  seven  of  the  opposition  were  reported  in  the 
same  paper  to  be  about  as  strong  as  could  be  called  up 
in  the  absence  of  F.  H.  Browning,  and  a  good  many 
people  were  at  pains  to  inform  us  that  all  the  best  bowling 
in  Ireland  was  arrayed  against  us,  it  must  have  been 
rather  a  blow  to  the  prophets  when  we  converted  what 
looked  like  a  lost  match  into  a  distinctly  favourable 
draw.  My  whole  idea  in  getting  up  the  side  had  been 
to  collect  a  team  capable  of  making  a  fair  show  in  the 
Dublin  matches,  and  at  the  same  time  not  overwhelmingly 
strong  for  the  outlying  garrisons.  And  now  that  it  is 
all  over  I  may  fairly  claim  to  have  accomplished  my 
object.  We  had  a  bit  the  better  of  the  draws  with  the 
Viceregal  and  Limerick  County  teams,  and  we  defeated 
the  Curragh  by  8  wickets  and  the  Military  of  Ireland  by 
3  wickets.  In  fact,  we  proved  ourselves  to  be  rather  a 
better  team  in  the  field  than  we  looked  on  paper,  and 
the   show  we  made  contrasts  very  favourably  with   that

HARD  HITTING.  333 

of  the  far  more  classy  I  Zingari  side  which  invaded 
Ireland  earlier  in  the  season.  By  far  the  most  creditable 
performance  of  the  tour  was  our  second  innings  against 
the  Viceregal  XI.  In  the  first  innings  our  opponents 
made  on  a  slow  but  very  easy  wicket  255.  Their  batting 
was  described  as  being  most  pugnacious,  and  they  cer- 
tainly seemed  to  be  thoroughly  at  home  with  the  ex- 
traordinary lights  and  shadows  of  a  ground  surrounded 
on  all  sides  by  trees.  As  no  one  on  our  side  seemed 
to  be  able  to  judge  a  catch,  the  batsmen  hit  out  freely 
with  absolute  impunity.  When  we  went  in  to  bat  at 
5  P.M.  the  light  was  abominably  bad,  and  Maynard  was 
the  only  man  on  the  side  who  seemed  to  have  any  notion 
of  timing  the  ball  or  judging  the  pitch  of  two  slow 
bowlers.  Penny  and  Hamilton,  the  latter  of  whom  came 
out  with  an  extraordinary  analysis.  Our  eight  best 
wickets  fell  overnight  for  68  runs,  and  on  the  following 
morning  the  other  three  went  for  one  more  run,  so  that 
we  had  to  follow  on  in  a  minority  of  166.  We  again 
started  badly,  losing  two  good  wickets  for  20  runs ;  but 
then  Hamilton's  steady  defence  and  Cuninghame's 
brilliant  hitting  altered  the  whole  complexion  of  the 
match.  Three  off- drives  made  by  Cuninghame  from 
consecutive  balls  sent  down  by  the  Irish  Hamilton  were 
magnificent  hits,  and  fairly  brought  down  the  house.  As 
long  as  Cuninghame  was  in,  the  bowlers  hardly  seemed  to 
know  where  to  pitch  the  ball ;  and  even  after  he  was  dis- 
posed of  for  a  grandly  hit  118,  there  was  little  diminution  in 
the  pace  of  the  scoring.  Nearly  every  remaining  member 
of  the  side  got  into  respectable  double  figures,  and  the 
last  over  bowled  by  the  overnight  terror  Penny  produced 
19  runs.  The  local  papers  singled  out  Appleby  for  special 
commendation,  and  were  pleased  to  liken  him  to  one 
Phil  Casey ;  but  whether  the  latter  was  the  Clown  or  the 
Fenian  of  that  ilk  is  still  a  disputed  question.     Doubtless 


334  -4    TIGHT  FINIS//. 

Appleby,  who  accepted  the  position  with  characteristic 
modesty,  would  have  shone  in  either  capacity.  Eventu- 
ally we  put  in  our  opponents  to  make  190  runs,  and  as 
at  the  call  of  time  we  had  got  their  six  best  wickets  down 
for  90,  we  may  fairly  claim  to  have  had  a  bit  the  best  of 
the  deal.  For  the  Viceregal  side  Hamilton  and  Meldon 
played  sterling  good  cricket,  and  Penny  was  in  a  long 
time  for  his  runs ;  but  Cuninghame's  hitting  for  us  put  all 
other  performances  in  the  background. 

We  owed  our  victory  over  the  Military  of  Ireland  to 
Crosfield's  all-round  cricket.  In  this  particular  match  he 
batted,  bowled,  and  fielded  magnificently,  and,  fortunately 
for  us,  stayed  the  rot  which  had  set  in  at  the  outset  of  our 
second  innings,  when,  having  to  make  37  runs  to  win  the 
rnatch,  we  started  by  losing  6  wickets  for  11.  For  the 
soldiers.  Finch  and  Morant  bowled  finely  on  a  wicket 
which  the  uninvited  application  of  the  roller,  while  we 
were  in  the  dressing-room,  had  made  extremely  difficult, 
and  it  did  not  take  us  long  to  discover  that  the  victory 
which  we  had  already  begun  to  discount  was  no  great 
certainty  after  all,  and  though  we  did  eventually  pull 
through  by  3  wickets,  we  had  not  much  to  boast  about. 
Oswald  played  two  really  fine  innings  for  the  soldiers,  and 
Finch  hit  with  some  luck  and  much  pluck. 

The  other  matches  in  Ireland  were  so  much  interfered 
with  by  the  weather  that  it  is  not  worth  while  to  give 
any  details.  I  would  recommend  any  future  manager 
of  a  F.  F.  team  in  Ireland  to  see  that  his  XI  is  amply 
provided  with  mud-wicket  bowlers  and  waterproof  garments, 
and  leave  the  batting  to  look  after  itself ;  and,  above  all, 
I  would  warn  him  either  to  avoid  the  week  of  the  Dublin 
Horse  Show  or  to  take  a  stout-hearted  and,  for  choice,  an 
impecunious  side,  abundantly  insured  in  Accidental  In- 
surance Companies.

School  Matches. 


Hitherto  I  have  treated  of  matches  or  series  of  matches 
in  which  I  have  from  time  to  time  myself  taken  an  active 
part.  But  as  it  is  impossible  for  an  individual  to  be,  like 
the  Free  Forester  Club,  ubiquitous,  and  as,  moreover,  it 
is  only  on  rare  occasions  that  the  hard-worked  school- 
master can  snatch  a  day  for  cricket  until  the  end  of  July, 
there  have  of  necessity  been  any  number  of  F.  F.  matches 
of  which  I  know  little  beyond  the  facts  that  I  see  them 
down  on  the  card,  hear  of  them  at  the  meeting,  and  oc- 
casionally find  them  reported  in  the  *  Field '  or  the 
*  Sportsman.'  And  here  let  me  remark  that,  with  all 
due    respect    to  *  Cricket '    and  the    '  Cricket-field,'   I   am 


SCHOOL  MATCHES,  337 

inclined  to  believe  that  the  '  Field '  and  the  '  Sportsman/ 
as  having  a  wider  circulation,  are  the  most  convenient 
papers  in  which  to  report  matches. 

In  the  first  places,  then,  come  matches  against  the 
Public  Schools,  those  treasured  opportunities  for  revisit- 
ing haunts  of  the  past,  as  well  as  favourable  occasions  for 
keeping  in  touch  with  the  Foresters  of  the  future.  In- 
cluding Woolwich  Academy — I  must  apologise  to  the 
gentlemen  -  cadets  and  sub  -  officers  for  thus  classifying 
such  veterans  among  schoolboys — there  are  no  less  than 
seven  of  these  matches  on  the  '94  programme,  and  the 
only  thing  to  be  regretted  is  that  there  are  not  more.  It 
would  be  sound  policy  for  a  Club  of  this  stamp,  which 
naturally  recruits  its  ranks  almost  entirely  from  men  who 
hail  from  public  schools,  to  make  it  a  rule— subject,  of 
course,  to  an  invitation — to  visit  every  public  school  once 
at  least  in  three  years.  And  if  it  is  the  case,  as  rumour 
says,  that  it  is  impossible  to  induce  men  to  go  far  away 
from  London  to  play  matches  in  June  and  July,  there 
must  be  plenty  of  local  Foresters,  belonging  either  to  the 
Active  Service  Corps  or  the  Reserve  Battalion,  in  every 
county  in  England  to  form  the  nucleus  of  a  side.  At  any 
rate,  my  own  experience  in  getting  up  F.  F.  teams  has  been 
that,  if  time  is  taken  by  the  forelock,  it  is  far  more  easy  to 
make  oneself  unpopular  by  refusing  applications  for  places 
than  it  is  difficult  to  muster  a  fairly  strong  side. 

Only  once  have  I  had  the  chance  of  playing  against  a 
school  for  the  Foresters,  and  that  was  some  few  years  ago 
at  Eton,  when  on  a  hard  wicket  I  was  snicked  to  leg  by 
those  Eton  boys  in  a  way  which  was  "quite  frightful  to 
see."  The  boys  made  plenty  of  runs,  and  we  only  got  an 
innings  late  in  the  afternoon ;  but  even  then,  thanks  to 
some  marvellously  fast  scoring  by  Arthur  Heath  and  H. 
J.  Burrell,  those  runs  would  have  been  got  in  the  time,  but 
for  the  interference  of  an  umpire,  who  came  to  the  rescue 

Y 


338  ETON  AND  RUGBY. 

of  his  side  with  one  of  those  decisions  which  only  a  school 
umpire  or  a  village-green  ignoramus  has  the  hardihood 
to  utter.  When  the  partnership  between  two  men  who 
were  flogging  weak  bowling  and  had  grown  accustomed 
to  the  light  was  dissolved,  slower  scoring  followed,  and 
we  had  to  rest  content  with  a  moral  victory.  But  the 
Forester  sides  at  Eton,  which  have  usually  of  late  years 
been  got  up  by  Charlie  Farmer,  have  by  no  means  had 
matters  entirely  their  own  way,  and  several  of  the  drawn 
games  have  been  much  in  favour  of  the  School.  It  has 
not  been  found  altogether  an  easy  task  to  please  the 
powers  that  govern  the  cricket  at  Eton,  and  more  than 
one  side  that  has  gone  there  has  been  pronounced  to  be 
either  too  strong  or  too  weak  or  too  local  to  be  entirely 
satisfactory. 

Probably  the  most  popular  of  all  the  matches  against 
Public  Schools  is  the  annual  two-day  fixture  at  Rugby. 
In  the  first  place,  owing  to  the  excellent  service  of  trains, 
Rugby  is  very  accessible  from  the  metropolis ;  in  the 
second  place,  many  Free  Foresters  are  old  Rugbeians  ; 
and  lastly,  it  is  felt  that  the  Free  Forester  match  is  one  of 
the  events  of  the  Rugby  cricket  season  really  looked 
forward  to  by  the  boys,  and  likely  to  have  a  definite 
conclusion.  Of  late  the  Foresters  have  generally  had  the 
better  of  the  deal,  but  appearances  point  to  better  things 
to  come  in  the  way  of  Rugby  cricket,  which  has  fallen 
far  below  the  standard  of  the  days  in  which  Rutter,  Willes, 
Venables,  Francis,  poor  Bernard  Pauncefote,  Harry  Tubb, 
and  other  celebrated  Foresters  first  made  their  mark. 
Now  and  again  some  of  these  time-honoured  names  crop 
up  in  the  Forester  teams  which  oppose  the  School.  And 
a  few  years  back  a  cheeky  young  member  of  the  School 
XI  was  heard  to  cast  somewhat  disparaging  reflections  on 
the  personal  appearance  of  the  side  which  was  representing 
the  Club.     "  Well,"  remarked  the  youthful  critic,  "  this  is 


RUGBY  WIT.  339 

the  funniest  side  I  ever  saw.  All  of  them  have  got  grey 
hair  except  three,  and  they  have  got  no  hair  at  all."  But 
if  it  was  a  funny  side  to  look  at,  it  proved  fairly  strong 
when  it  came  to  playing  cricket,  and  the  fielding  of  the 
grey-headed  and  bald-headed  old  gentlemen  was  about 
as  good  as  anything  that  the  boys  saw  that  season.  The 
Foresters  administered  a  sound  thrashing  to  the  School, 
thereby  proving  that  the  old  adage,  "youth  must  be 
served,"  does  not  hold  quite  as  good  in  cricket  as  in 
other  forms  of  athletic  exercises.  It  would  be  invidious 
to  mention  names,  but  I  could  count  on  my  fingers  at 
this  minute  an  XI  of  bald-headed  Foresters  who  would 
make  rings  round  any  Public  School  side  at  Lord's.  To 
have  played  in  the  Rugby  XI  was  in  days  gone  by 
regarded  as  a  sort  of  passport  for  entrance  into  the  ranks 
of  the  Free  Foresters,  and  good  service  has  been  often 
rendered  to  the  Club  by  the  old  Rugbeian  contingent. 

It  is  unfortunate  that  Malvern  and  Uppingham,  which 
have  lately  turned  out  excellent  sides,  should  be  so  very 
inaccessible  from  town,  and  that  a  good  deal  of  difficulty 
has  been  experienced  in  getting  a  sufficiently  strong  For- 
ester team  to  undertake  the  journey.  Several  good  crick- 
eters from  either  School  have  lately  been  elected  For- 
esters, and  it  would  seem  to  rest  with  them  to  emulate 
George  Willes'  example,  and  collect  a  side  capable  of 
better  things  than  merely  leather-hunting  for  the  boys. 

Kent  and  South  Coast  Matches  in  1894. 

My  apology  for  having  written  at  some  length  of  events 
which  occurred  in  the  later  days  of  the  season  before  treat- 
ing of  other  matches  must  be  that  I  preferred  to  record 
what  was  still  fresh  in  my  memory  before  attempting  to 
grapple  with  the -results  of  a  very  lengthy  programme  of 
matches. 


340  R'A.   AND  R.E. 

In  Kent  the  Foresters  cannot  be  said  to  have  shown 
to  great  advantage,  as  we  were  decisively  beaten  both 
at  Woolwich  and  Chatham,  and  in  both  matches  sides 
which  on  paper  looked  strong  in  batting  failed  to  make 
a  respectable  show.  In  our  first  innings  at  Woolwich  we 
actually  lost  6  good  wickets  for  17  runs,  and  in  the  in- 
evitable follow-on,  which,  by  the  way,  the  courtesy  of  the 
Woolwich  captain  postponed  to  the  good  light  of  the 
second  day,  batsman  after  batsman  stayed  at  the  wicket 
long  enough  apparently  to  get  set,  and  then  retired  clean 
bowled.  There  were  some  curious  decisions  given  by  the 
umpires,  both  of  whom  seemed  to  be  affected  with  tem- 
porary blindness ;  but,  fortunately,  their  mistakes  did  not 
in  any  way  affect  the  issue  of  the  match,  and  our  oppo- 
nents as  thoroughly  deserved  to  win  as  we  did  to  lose 
what  proved  a  very  one-sided  game.  For  the  Gun- 
ners, De  Rougemont,  after  feeling  for  the  ball  for  his  first 
few  overs,  played  well  and  hit  hard,  while  Orlebar  gave 
for  us  what  the  *  Sportsman '  would  describe  as  a  dashing 
display  during  the  short  time  that  he  was  in.  Don 
Wauchope's  catch,  which  brought  the  first  innings  of 
the  Gunners  to  a  close,  was  one  of  the  finest  I  have  ever 
seen  in  the  long  field.  He  had  to  run  a  very  long  way 
to  the  ball,  and  no  one  but  an  exceptionally  fast  mover 
could  have  got  to  the  catch  at  all.  In  our  Chatham  match 
we  secured  a  fair  lead  in  the  first  innings,  but  in  the 
second  our  batting  collapsed  in  the  most  disappointing 
manner.  We  had  rather  the  worst  of  the  luck  in  the. 
way  of  the  wicket,  as  the  umpires  elected  to  delay  the 
match  after  a  heavy  downpour  of  rain  on  the  second  day 
of  the  match  just  long  enough  to  give  the  bowlers  every 
advantage.  But  it  is  graceless  work  attempting  to  explain 
away  defeats,  and  the  real  secret  of  our  discomfiture  lay 
in  the  excellence  of  Bayfield's  bowling  against  fame  and 
feeble  batting,  and  the  smart  out-fielding  of  the  Sappers^ 


\ 


CHATHAM  AND   THE  MOTE.  341 

which  contrasted  very  favourably  with  our  own  display. 
For  them  all  the  catches  in  the  country  seemed  to  come 
to  hand;  but  though  in  both  innings  Tandy  and  others 
hit  hard  and  high,  often  the  only  catch  which  our  out- 
fields brought  off  was  one  which  Dorehill  clasped  to  his 
body.  It  is  a  long  lane  that  has  no  turning,  and  the  Free 
Foresters  could  well  afford  to  lose  a  match  to  their  cheery 
hosts  at  Chatham. 

The  Mote  we  beat  handsomely  by  10  wickets,  and  had 
only  a  moderate  percentage  of  the  chances  they  gave  in 
their  second  innings  been  taken,  we  should  have  won  in 
an  innings.  As  it  was,  nearly  every  batsman  on  their 
side  made  double  figures,  and  most  of  them  gave  two  or 
more  easy  chances.  For  us  Spurway  and  Tonge  played 
fine  cricket,  and  Hewett's  rough  handling  of  Walter 
Wright's  bowling  showed  that  Atkins  is  not  the  only 
left-handed  batsman  who  can  "cart"  left-handed  bowl- 
ing on  the  Mote  ground.  It  was  even-money  betting 
that  Hewett  would  hit  Wright  to  the  boundary  twice  at 
least  in  every  over,  and  to  the  left-handed  trundler  who 
started  the  bowling  at  the  other  end  he  was  even  more 
unkind. 

It  was  a  source  of  deep  regret  to  the  Foresters  that  there 
was  no  August  cricket  at  Linton  Park,  and  that  conse- 
quently the  very  pleasant  annual  match  there  did  not  figure 
in  the  programme  for  '94.  And  the  match  which  had  been 
arranged  with  Boxley  eventually  fell  through,  owing,  I  fear, 
to  the  indisposition  of  one  of  the  kindliest  of  our  many 
kindly  hosts  in  Kent.  A  pleasant  substitute  for  the  Linton 
match  was  the  game  played  at  Bedgebury  Park,  where 
Captain  H.  Campbell  entertained  us  royally,  and  got 
together  a  fairly  strong  side  to  meet  us.  We  were  vilely 
treated  by  the  weather,  and  the  wicket  is  probably  slow 
under  any  circumstances  ;  but  we  had,  notwithstanding,  a 
most  sociable  and  fairly  even  match,  and  thoroughly  enjoyed 


342  BEDGEBURY  PARK. 

our  two  days'  visit.  When  rain  stopped  play  on  the  second 
day  we  were  in  the  enviable  position  of  being  practically 
"dormy,"  as,  while  we  had  a  chance  of  winning,  by  no 
possible  combination  of  circumstances  could  we  have 
absolutely  lost  the  match.  Hewett  hit  well  in  each  innings, 
and  Leatham  was  also  on  the  knock  ;  but  Spurway's  was 
perhaps  the  soundest  exhibition  of  batting.  Sidney 
Crosfield  made  his  runs  well  for  the  other  side,  and  it  was 
refreshing  to  see  that  Joe  Hadow's  absence  from  the 
cricket-field  had  not  made  him  forget  what  a  half-volley 
looked  like.  Stanley  Christopherson  did  a  little  fancy 
bowling,  and  hereby  hangs  a  tale.  Chris  had  originally 
been  expected  to  play  throughout  the  week,  but  was 
detained  in  London  by  business.  As  we  had  not  got  him 
to  bowl  for  us  at  the  Mote,  we  consoled  ourselves  by  talking 
about  the  great  things  he  would  have  done  for  us  ;  and 
whenever  our  bowling  was  at  all  in  a  knot,  our  gallant 
leader,  Lionel  Spens,  made  the  same  apology,  "  If  Stanley 
Christopherson  had  been  here,  we  should  have  had  them 
out  in  no  time." 

In  fact,  so  great  was  the  value  that  was  set  on  Chris's 
services,  and  such  the  enchantment  that  distance  added  to 
the  view,  that  it  was  determined  to  play  with  ten  men  on 
the  first  day  of  the  Bedgebury  match  rather  than  risk  the 
loss  of  so  potent  an  auxiliary  on  the  second.  And  through- 
out the  earlier  part  of  the  enemy's  innings  we  still  continued 
to  conjure  with  the  name  of  Stanley  Christopherson.  In 
fact,  Crosfield,  who  was  the  overnight  "  not  out,"  probably 
had  a  nightmare,  in  which  Chris  with  cricket-ball  in  hand 
played  a  prominent  part.  And  in  the  morning  Chris  in 
person  came  and  saw,  and — bowled  the  three  most  ghastly 
overs  that  ever  were  sent  down.  Of  the  fifteen  balls,  eleven 
were  rather  fast  long-hops  on  the  off,  and  the  other  four 
rather  slow  full  pitches  to  leg.  Seldom  has  a  bowler 
displayed  so  much  want  of  originality.     Had  he  sent  down 


DRAWN  AGAIN.  343 

a  full  pitch  to  off  or  a  long-hop  to  leg,  or  even  an  occasional 
straight  ball,  it  would  have  been  a  welcome  variety ;  but 
nothing  of  the  sort  occurred,  and  by  the  end  of  the  third 
over,  point,  the  umpire,  and  short-leg  had  had  plenty  of 
perilous  excitement.  It  was  fortunate  for  us  that  a  hit  to 
the  off-side  boundary  counted  three,  and  that  one  of  the 
batsmen  was  of  the  cautious  type  ;  but  whenever  Crosfield 
got  to  that  end,  matters  became  extremely  lively.  Our 
only  bowler's  skill  will  require  a  considerable  amount  of 
booming  before  it  ever  again  reaches  the  premium  it 
commanded  previous  to  being  actually  in  the  market,  and 
the  downfall  of  Pip's  great  expectations  was  a  mere  trifle 
compared  to  the  bursting  of  the  still  greater  Stanley 
Christopherson  bubble. 

The  Southampton,  Portsmouth,  and  Aldershot  tour  re- 
sulted, as  usual,  in  two  drawn  matches  at  the  former  places 
and  a  win  at  the  last-named.  It  would  seem  desirable 
that  two  three-day  matches  should  in  that  particular  week 
take  the  place  of  three  two-day  fixtures.  A  cricket-match 
without  a  definite  result  is  always  unsatisfactory,  and  when 
two  sides  go  into  the  field  year  after  year  with  a  sort  of 
condition  that,  bar  accident,  a  draw  will  be  the  result  of 
two  days*  work,  the  game  must  lose  a  good  deal  of  interest, 
and  men  are  tempted  to  play,  like  the  Gow  Chrom,  for  their 
own  hand.  There  is  a  certain  monotony  about  having  to 
make  the  same  old  stereotyped  remarks :  "  We  should 
have  won  if  we  had  time,"  or,  "  We  saved  the  match  any- 
how," year  after  year ;  and  though  in  the  days  to  come  we 
may  look  back  with  some  pardonable  pride  on  our  vic- 
tories, and  occasionally  brood  over  our  reverses,  the  draws, 
whether  in  our  favour  or  against  us,  will  still  be  labelled 
unsatisfactory.  I  have  heard  a  rumour  to  the  effect  that 
Peeler  Buckland,  who,  as  being  less  than  ten  years  younger 
than  myself,  must  be  accounted  quite  a  veteran,  had  a  not 
altogether  encouraging  experience  of  this  particular  tour 


344  SOUTH  COAST. 

in  the  seasons  of  '92  and  '93.  In  the  latter  of  these  years 
he  received  two  balls  and  scored  o  and  o  in  the  whole  week, 
but  as  a  set-off  against  this  bad  luck  had  the  pleasure  of 
fielding  out  for  something  like  1200  runs.  In  '92  he  was 
rather  more  fortunate,  as  he  made  very  nearly  20  runs 
himself,  and  only  had  to  field  out  for  about  1000.  But  he 
was  intensely  pleased  at  being  spoken  of  by  a  young  and 
zealous  member  of  the  side  as  "  the  old  gentleman."  The 
fact  that  a  still  older  gentleman  in  the  season  just  ended 
helped  to  put  on  160  runs  for  the  last  wicket  in  a  Forester 
match  ought  to  be  an  encouragement  to  a  good  many  of 
us,  who  have  begun  to  feel  that  our  room  might  be  more 
valuable  than  our  company  in  some  of  the  August  matches. 
H.  J.  Burrell  scored  largely  in  both  innings  at  Southamp- 
ton, though  a  good  deal  of  encouragement  was  required  in 
the  second  innings  to  make  him  forget  that  he  had  dam- 
aged his  hand.  At  Portsmouth,  Hornsby,  who  elected  to 
figure  in  the  ranks  of  the  opposition,  found  Streatfeild's 
bowling  a  bit  too  good  for  him,  and  possibly  wished  before 
the  game  was  over  that  he  had  been  playing  on  the 
Forester  side.  For  once  in  a  way  no  one  got  a  century 
in  the  week,  though  Burrell  went  very  near  it.  In  '92 
Captain  Quinton  amused  himself  by  making  120  for  the 
Foresters  at  Southampton  and  somewhere  about  the  same 
number  against  them  at  Portsmouth,  and  he  made  another 
century  in  one  of  the  '93  matches.  In  short,  to  individual 
cricketers  matches  on  these  two  very  easy  grounds  have 
been  pleasant  opportunities  for  making  large  scores ;  but  as 
six  matches  in  succession  have  been  left  drawn,  it  would 
seem  advisable  either  to  put  the  Aldershot  match  into 
another  week,  and  have  three-day  fixtures  at  Southampton 
and  Portsmouth,  or  to  let  it  be  an  understood  thing  that 
each  side  shall  do  its  level  best  to  cap  the  score  made  by 
the  Australians  in  1893,  ^i^^)  like  the  Austrahans,  make  no 
attempt  to  finish  the  match. 


ECCE  ITERUM.  345 

History  repeats  itself,  and  Teddy  Rutter  once  more 
co.MES  TO  the  Fore. 

It  has  been  the  unanimous  feeling  of  Foresters  who 
have  been  consulted  in  the  matter  that  the  subjoined  score 
should  have  a  page  to  itself.  It  would  almost  seem  as 
if  our  worshipful  and  honoured  Secretary  had  purposely 
delayed  the  production  of  these  records,  which  had  not 
been  originally  intended  to  include  the  year  1894,  and 
had  made  up  his  mind  that,  before  the  book  was  finally 
published,  he  would  yet  do  one  more  doughty  deed  which 
should  stand  forth  as  a  conspicuous  example  for  younger 
generations  of  Free  Foresters.  I  believe  it  to  be  a  fact 
that  at  the  time  when  Rutter  joined  Savory  a  follow-on 
was  still  on  the  cards.  By  the  time  that  memorable  stand 
was  over  and  Rutter  left,  possibly,  like  Fitz-James,  "breath- 
less all,"  and  certainly,  like  that  hero,  master  of  the  situa- 
tion, the  only  hope  for  the  opposing  team  lay  in  a  draw, 
which  just — only  just — came  off.  I  have  seen  Savory  hit 
hard  and  well  more  than  once,  and  rumour  says  that  he 
hit  harder  than  usual,  and  that  some  of  his  drives  took  a 
good  deal  of  stopping.  He  gave,  it  is  true,  a  chance  to 
Draper,  but  an  eye-witness  remarked  it  was  one  of  those 
chances  which  few  men  but  the  plucky  old  Rector  would 
have  gone  for.

And  now  I  have  finished  my  appointed  task,  and  have 
given  what  I  fear  is  a  very  lame  and  a  very  imperfect 
sketch  of  Free  Forester  cricket  during  these  latter  years. 
It  only  remains  for  me  to  thank  many  secretaries  of 
private  and  other  cricket  clubs  for  furnishing  copies  of 
scores,  and  to  apologise  to  many  men  for  not  entirely 
respectful,  if  friendly,  mention  of  their  names.  I  think 
that  it  may  be  fairly  claimed  for  our  Club  that  in  every 
part  of  the  United  Kingdom  to  which  it  has  wandered, 
it  has  played  the  game  of  cricket  in  the  spirit  in  which 
cricket  should  be  played ;  that  we  Foresters  have  worked 
for  victory  hard  and  accepted  defeat  not  ungraciously; 
that  we  have  shown  our  due  appreciation  of  the  merits 
of  our  opponents,  and  due  gratitude  to  the  many  clubs 
and  private  houses  which  have  opened  their  doors  to  us. 
And  for  myself  I  will  just  add  that  I  account  the  days  I 
have  spent  in  playing  for  the  Free  Foresters  as  the 
brightest  and  happiest  in  my  cricket  career,  and  that 
I  shall  always  regard  the  Club,  to  which  for  ten  years 
past  I  have  been  "  united  though  untied,"  as  the  beau 
ideal  of  what  an  Amateur  Cricket  Club  ought  to  be.

CHAPTER    XXXVII. 


WILLES'S   TOURS. 


It  was  in  1883  that  a  suggestion  was  made  by  Captain 
Willes,  the  secretary  of  the  newly  formed  East  Glouces- 
tershire Cricket  Club,  that  the  Free  Foresters  should  play 
an  annual  match  on  the  picturesque  ground  at  Charlton 
Park,  Cheltenham.  This  match  was  undertaken  by  W.  H. 
P.  Jenkins  and  G.  E.  Willes,  and  was  continued  year  by 
year  until  1891.     The  first  match  was  won  by  E.  G.  C.  C 


348  ''ALMOST  THE  DELUGE?' 

by  one  wicket,  and  was  the  forerunner  of  many  a  stubborn 
fight.  In  1884  the  average  ages  of  the  Free  Forester  team 
was  thirty-five,  and  one  of  their  number,  Clarence  Smith, 
played  an  admirable  innings  of  105.  In  another  match, 
at  Cheltenham,  A.  W.  Moon  scored  over  90  not  out,  while 
the  total  of  the  whole  side  only  amounted  to  122  ;  the 
wicket  was  sodden,  and  no  one  except  himself  could  do 
anything  with  the  bowling.  On  another  occasion  W.  D. 
Bovill  did  an  excellent  performance,  getting  a  lot  of  runs, 
and  taking  all  the  wickets  in  one  innings.  The  last  match 
that  was  played  v.  E.  G.  C.  C.  was  in  1891,  and  was  remark- 
able for  the  fact  that,  both  days  being  more  or  less  wet, 
E.  G.  C.  C.  did  not  handle  the  willow,  the  Foresters  keeping 
possession  of  the  wickets  during  all  the  available  time  of 
play,  and  making  371  for  the  loss  of  6  wickets.  Nor  must 
we  omit  an  incident  which  created  much  amusement  and 
not  a  little  controversy  at  the  time :  a  certain  prominent 
member  of  the  E.  G.  C.  C.  in  the  1890  match  played 
the  ball  twice,  on  the  second  occasion  putting  it  in  the 
direction  of  point.  The  ball  was  picked  up,  and  hurled 
somewhat  wide  of  the  bowler's  wicket  in  .the  direction  of 
the  boundary.  The  batsman  started  to  run,  and  the  umpire 
adjudged  him  "  Out,"  whereupon  laughter,  confusion,  and 
almost  "the  Deluge." 

In  1885  operations  were  extended  to  Ludlow,  and  v. 
Radnorshire  at  Knighton,  where  F.  C.  Cobden  of  Cam- 
bridge fame  (the  Cobden,  as  he  once  was  called  by  a 
youthful  cricketer)  had  always  a  strong  team  against  the 
Foresters,  while  Frank  Sitwell  also  did,  and  still  does,  his 
best  to  beat  the  Club  at  Ludlow.  It  was  on  the  Knighton 
ground  in  1885  that  F.  W.  Capron  scored  105  in  almost 
record  time,  and  a  year  or  two  later  C.  E.  Cobb  knocked 
up  73  in  thirty-five  minutes. 

Pleasant,  indeed,  are  the  memories  of  these  matches,  and 
of    the    hospitable   homes   in    which   the    Foresters   have 


THE  ROVER.  349 

always  been  entertained  so  regally.  Nor  shall  we  lightly 
forsfet  the  welcome  we  have  received  in  the  houses  of  R. 
Harley,  C.  Rogers,  H.  Crawshay,  Lady  Gierke,  R.  G. 
Venables,  &amp;c.;  and  last,  but  not  least,  at  Ferney  Hall,  the 
home  of  that  good  sportsman,  W.  H.  Sitwell,  who  is  not 
only  a  Forester  himself  but  the  father  of  two  of  the  best, 
Tim  and  Franky. 

But  here  a  memory  of  Knighton  cricket-ground  intrudes 
itself.  Frank  Cobden  was  practising  at  a  net  before  a 
match, — for  a  wonder  he  was  playing  steadily, — and  so 
pleased  was  he  with  his  performance  that  he  ventured  to 
compare  himself  with  Fuller  Pilch,  whereupon  a  funny 
man  behind  the  net,  a  native,  gravely  remarked,  "  Full  o' 
whisky,  you  mean,  whatever." 

And  now  perhaps  may  follow  some  lines  by  the  Forester 
bard,  which  illustrate  an  event  of  some  obscurity.  The 
subject  of  them  was  not  then  a  Forester ;  we  had  picked 
him  up  en  route,  and  right  good  service  did  he  do  us, 
scoring  v,  Ludlow  57  and  43  (not  out),  and  taking  15 
wickets. 

"  After  the  dinner  was  over, 

When  no  one  could  drink  any  more, 
We  discovered  our  Uppingham  Rover, 
Fast  asleep,  on  the  step  of  the  door. 

When  asked  for  a  true  explanation 

By  the  rest  of  the  Forester  team, 
He  said,  'twas  excessive  potation 

Of  his  hostess's  excellent  cream. 

But  all  sportsmen  who  know  Mrs  Rowton, 

And  have  dined  at  her  table  before, 
This  fact  will  have  never  a  doubt  on. 

That  cream  was  the  best  of  creme  d'or. 

And  now  that  our  cricket  is  ended. 

Let  us  all  of  us  Foresters  Free 
Thank  our  hosts  for  their  welcome  extended, 

And  toast  them  with  thirty  times  three." 


350  AULD  LANGS YNE. 

Owing  in  a  great  measure  to  Frank  Cobden  leaving  the 
neighbourhood,  the  Knighton  match  was  abandoned,  and 
in  its  place  Heath  House  became  the  venue^  where  a 
welcome  both  by  night  and  day  was  extended  to  the  Club. 
How  shall  we  describe  the  hospitality  of  Mr  Seton  and 
Mrs  Sunderland  ?  Perfect  wickets  in  the  day,  a  perfect 
floor  at  night ;  fair  ladies  equally  ready  to  applaud  our 
feats  in  the  cricket-field  and  to  dance  us  off  our  legs  in 
the  ball-room.  Yes,  the  Heath  House  match  was  verily 
and  indeed  a  match  to  be  remembered,  and  many  a 
Forester  regrets  that  Mr  Seton  has  given  up  his  ground, 
and  that  we  shall  no  more  encounter  that  keenest  to  win, 
and  at  the  same  time  most  generous,  of  adversaries. 

But  we  must  say  a  word  or  two  of  other  matches. 
Worcester  was  visited,  and  a  place  was  given  in  the 
County  Club  cricket-week  to  the  Forester  match.  Some- 
how they  always  got  the  better  of  us,  as  they  succeeded 
in  putting  into  the  field  a  side  just  a  bit  too  strong  for  a 
"touring  team."  At  Shrewsbury,  however,  we  have  met 
with  better  success,  and  in  the  many  battles  which  have  of 
later  years  taken  place  on  the  old  ground  by  the  river, 
sometimes  the  County  and  sometimes  the  Foresters  have 
come  off  victorious.  Here  it  has  always  been  the  custom 
for  the  Foresters  to  stay  together  at  the  George  Hotel, 
and  hearty  has  been  the  welcome  we  have  received  year 
by  year  from  host  Fox  and  his  excellent  staff,  including 
that  most  amiable  and  all-important  functionary,  the  cook. 

Nor  must  we  forget  three  visits  to  Cirencester,  one  to 
Stoke  {v.  Staffordshire),  two  to  Hereford,  one  to  Leomin- 
ster, several  to  Wellesbourne ;  and,  above  all,  there  is  the 
memory  of  the  last  match  at  Sutton  Coldfield  in  the  good 
old  Rector's  time,  where  once  more  the  Father  of  the 
Club  gathered  "  his  children  "  round  him  in  the  ancestral 
home. 

No  one  can  rob  us  of  the  pleasures  we  have  had,  and 


DO   OR  DIE.  351 

there  is  many  a  Forester  who  will  keep  a  kindly  recollec- 
tion of  the  fun  he  has  had  with  "  the  Skipper "  and  his 
crew.  The  friendships  so  many  have  made,  the  places 
visited,  the  matches  lost  or  won,  will  linger  in  the  minds 
of  some  of  us  long  after  the  bat  has  been  laid  aside  and 
the  pads  handed  over  to  the  next  generation. 

In  one  never-to-be-forgotten  match  at  Shrewsbury,  "res 
venit  ad  triarios,"  or,  in  other  words,  a  distinguished  officer 
of  the  Royal  Artillery,  was  sent  in  to  face  the  attack  when 
there  were  two  wickets  to  fall  and  one  run  needed  to  give 
the  Foresters  a  victory.  The  gallant  Gunner's  face  wore 
a  "  do-or-die-in-the-attempt "  expression.  But  it  was  re- 
marked that  he  was  so  much  impressed  with  the  gravity 
of  the  occasion  that  he  entirely  omitted  the  formality 
of  taking  guard,  to  the  manifest  disconcertment  of  the 
umpire.  Perhaps  under  the  circumstances  it  was  fortunate 
that  the  ball,  the  last  of  the  over,  missed  both  bat  and 
wicket.  The  winning  hit  was  made  from  the  other  end, 
and  the  Gunner  to  this  day  doubtless  cherishes  a  pleasing 
recollection  of  the  way  in  which  he  kept  up  his  end,  and  of 
the  lusty  manner  in  which  he  smote — the  air.
