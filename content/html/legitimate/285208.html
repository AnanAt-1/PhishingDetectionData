Around 1977, I designed a pencil-and-paper game which I called (after some
deliberation, as all the best names were taken)
<CITE>Spellbinder</CITE>. Its premise was that two (or more) wizards were
placed together in an arena, where they battled it out using spells made by
stringing together series of (originally 5) basic gestures. I had been thinking
for some time about the similarity between generating spells and
programming computers, and this is what I finally designed in response. It bears a 
superficial resemblance to certain aspects of the duelling system from
the <CITE>Three Musketeers</CITE>-era game <CITE>En Garde!</CITE>, which I 
had played at the time, but these are coincidental; the two games are very
different.
<P>
For the first version, I used a board. Wizards were able to walk around, 
spells being represented by counters that moved at different speeds 
depending on how many gestures were used to create them. Although this 
worked, the map was cluttered and the bookkeeping tiresome; I felt it
would make for quicker and more exciting play if I abstracted out the 
positional information and concentrated on the fun 
part - &quot;programming&quot; spells on-the-fly from gestures.
<P>
This second version also worked, but the strategy aspect was now exposed as
too shallow. I therefore allowed wizards to gesture with
both hands instead of just one, and introduced an extra, two-handed gesture
to enforce occasional reconciliation between the gesture streams. I printed
the rules to this third version in my postal games magazine, 
<CITE>Sauce of the Nile</CITE>.
<P>
The game was warmly received, and several games were played successfully
by post. I negotiated for it to be published commercially by the same people 
who did my programmed-adventure game <CITE>The Solo Dungeon</CITE>, but (sigh) they went 
bankrupt before it happened. Unable to publish it myself (I was 17 and
penniless at the time), I pretty well had to give up on that idea.
Consequently, when one of my magazine's subscribers, 
<A HREF="http://homepages.enterprise.net/mikel"><PERSON>Mike Lean</PERSON></A>, 
asked to reproduce the rules to <CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> in his own postal 
games magazine, <CITE>Duel Purpose</CITE>, I gave him permission and forgot 
about it. Well, that's not perhaps strictly true: the magic system 
from <CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> formed the 
basis of the one in my novel,
<A HREF="http://www.youhaventlived.com/isif/isif.htm"><CITE>IN<SUB>flames</SUB><SUP>sight</SUP></CITE></A>,
however as a game I didn't do anything with it at all.
<P>
Many years later, I learned that people had programmed up
<CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> to be
played on computer. There were versions for email and head-to-head play. 
I was cited as its author, but was believed deceased (which, to the best of
my knowledge, I am not). The game was also renamed each time it was
rewritten, which is hardly surprising given the lousy title I gave it
myself! I was nevertheless quite pleased to find that what I knew as
<CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> was out there, living free, after all that time; 
it was like finding a long-lost friend.
<P>
There are
five different versions of <CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> that I'm aware of:

None of these products are commercial, which is just as well: I retain full rights to the
game, and if any commercial incarnation appears then I want a royalty!
I have no objection to people implementing or running derivatives of the 
<CITE>Spellbinder</CITE> so long as they make no money from it, though. Of course, if
<EM>you</EM> are interested in publishing the game commercially,
<A HREF="mailto:richard@mud.co.uk">email me</A> a proposal!
