<div id=article2><h1>Film director</h1>A <strong>film director</strong> directs the artistic and dramatic aspects of a <A HREF="../../f/fi/film_1.html" title="Film">film</A>.  The role typically includes:
<ul><li> Defining the overall artistic vision of the film.
</li><li> Controlling the content and flow of the film's plot.
</li><li> Directing the performances of actors, both mechanically by putting them in certain positions (i.e. blocking), and dramatically by eliciting the required range of emotions.
</li><li> Organizing and selecting the locations in which the film will be shot.
</li><li> Managing technical details such as the positioning of cameras, the use of lighting, and the timing and content of the film's <A HREF="../../s/so/soundtrack.html" title="Soundtrack">soundtrack</A>.
</li><li> Any other activity that defines or realizes the artistic vision the director has for the film.<p>
</li></ul>In practice the director will delegate many of these responsibilities to other members of his <A HREF="../../f/fi/film_crew.html" title="Film crew">film crew</A>.  For example, the director may describe the mood she or he wants from a scene, then leave it to other members of the film crew to find a suitable location, or to set up the appropriate lighting.<p>
The degree of control that a director exerts over a film varies greatly. Many directors are essentially subordinate to the studio, especially true during the "Golden Era" of Hollywood from the 1930s through the 1950s, when studios had stables of directors, actors and writers under contract.<p>
Other directors bring a particular artistic vision to the pictures they make (see <A HREF="../../a/au/auteur_theory.html" title="Auteur theory">auteur theory</A>). Their methods range from some who like to outline a general plot line and let the actors improvise dialogue (such as <A HREF="../../r/ro/robert_altman.html" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</A> and <A HREF="../../c/ch/christopher_guest.html" title="Christopher Guest">Christopher Guest</A>), to those who control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely (such as <A HREF="../../a/al/alfred_hitchcock.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</A> and <A HREF="../../s/st/stanley_kubrick.html" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</A>). Some directors also write their own scripts (such as <A HREF="../../p/pa/paul_thomas_anderson.html" title="Paul Thomas Anderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</A> and <A HREF="../../q/qu/quentin_tarantino.html" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</A>), while others collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners (such as <A HREF="../../b/bi/billy_wilder.html" title="Billy Wilder">Billy Wilder</A> and his writing partner I.A.L. Diamond.) Finally, certain directors star, often in leading roles, in their films, from <A HREF="../../o/or/orson_welles.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</A> to <A HREF="../../w/wo/woody_allen.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</A> to <A HREF="../../b/ba/barbra_streisand.html" title="Barbra Streisand">Barbra Streisand</A>.<p>
Directors often work closely with film producers, who are usually responsible for the non-artistic elements of the film, such as financing, contract negotiation and marketing. Directors will often take on some of the responsibilities of the producer for their films (e.g. <A HREF="../../s/st/steven_spielberg.html" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</A>), or work so closely with the producer that the distinction in their roles becomes blurred (as is the case with <A HREF="../../j/jo/joel_and_ethan_coen.html" title="Joel and Ethan Coen">Joel and Ethan Coen</A>).<p>
The official film directors' union is the <A HREF="../../d/di/directors_guild_of_america.html" title="Directors Guild of America">Directors Guild of America</A> (DGA).<p>
