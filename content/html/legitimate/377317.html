Coroner Called Following Sudden Death

The Antelope County Coroner and Antelope County Sheriff's Department
were called to the Elgin tree dump Saturday morning to investigate a
sudden death. Chief Deputy Bill Bailey reported that Leo Beelart, 62,
had died of an apparent blood clot, according to his private
physician, Dr Albert Halls of Elgin.  Halls reported that he had been
treating Beelart for a clot-related problem, Bailey said.

According to Bailey, Beelart and his sisters, Mary Delores, Martha
and Frances Beelart, were at the tree dump, located about 5.4 miles
west of Elgin, to gather shingles and other kindling.  Beelart was
apparently climbing over a fence when he was stricken, Bailey said.

None of the Beelart sisters is able to drive, Deputy Bailey
continued, so two began performing CPR on Beelart while the third
went for assistance.  Beelart was pronounced dead at the scene when
the Elgin Rescue Squad arrived, Bailey said..hhw

Henry Mallette 

1876-1976 Centennial History of Hooper 
Page 194
 
The Henry Mallette family was a prominent farm family of Northeast
of Hooper in the Admah Area.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Mallette were
descendants of early pioneers of Dodge County. Mrs. Mallette, the
former Ella Wagner, was a daughter of Carl L. A. (August) Wagner
and Elizabeth Uehling.
 
Parents of August Wagner were George Wagner I and Christina Seitz. 
They came from Wiesbaden,(1) Germany to Cleveland, Ohio, then to
Madison, Dodge County, Wisconsin(2). On April 1, 1861, the family
left Wisconsin by covered wagon and arrived at Logan Creek, Dodge
County, Nebraska on July 4, 1861.  A Lutheran Church was built in
1874 next to the Logan Cemetery which is located on land
homesteaded by George Wagner I.
 
Parents of Elizabeth Uehling were Hieruhet Johanne Uehling,(3) and
Eliza Tratfetter(4). The Uehling family came from Saxon, Germany- -
First to Madison, Dodge County, Wisconsin(2) and then to Dodge
County, Nebraska in 1864.
 
Henry Mallette's parents, Captain Thomas and Laura Mallette
homesteaded in what is now Dodge and Washington Counties in 1865.
Captain Mallette than went back to sea, returning to Nebraska in
1872.  The family lived on the farm until Henry took over in 1898
when he and Ella Wagner were married.
 
Two generations of the Mallette family were born and grew up on the
homestead--the children of Captain Thomas and Laura Mallette and
the ten children of Henry and Ella Mallette. According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, Henry Mallette was one of 3% of the population of
the United States in 1960 who had spent an entire lifetime at the
same place.  In 1968, Mrs. Virgil Lane and her daughters were
recipients of the Nebraska Centennial Distinguished Pioneer Family
Award issued to families who settled in Nebraska and have
maintained continuous residence since 1867. Mrs. Lane (Lorene) is a
daughter of the Henry Mallette's and is the present owner of part
of the homestead.
 
A son of the Henry Mallettes, Steve, was one of the first
casualties of Dodge County in W W II, having lost his life at
Cherbourg, France on June 14, 1944.  Another son, Harold, won five
stars for having participated in five major battles of that war.
 
All the descendants of the Mallette family have been active in
community, agricultural and sports activities in the areas where
they live.
 
(1) The Wagner family lived at Mittelschefflenz, Baden, Germany.
(2) Clyman, Dodge County, Wisconsin (3) Johannes (John) Uehling.

The deep snow was indirectly responsible for the death of Jim
Mallette, 16 year old son of Mr. and Mrs. Omer Mallette, who was
listed as Nebraska's first traffic fatality of 1967, following a
tragic accident Sunday.

Charmain Satree
February 2, 1953 -  November 6, 2020

Long time educator Charmain "Charm" Satree passed away peacefully on
November 6, surrounded by family and friends.

Charm was born February 2, 1953 in West Point, Nebraska to Ray and
Jean (Lane) Satree. The oldest of four, Charm loved her siblings
Doug, Shelly, and Steve with great pride and care. She was proud of
her Norwegian heritage: making lefse with family, researching her
ancestry, and eventually making the trip of a lifetime to Norway to
meet extended family.

At a very early age, Charm's love for the farm and athletics showed.
She helped with daily chores on the farm and was very active in her
school. She participated in 4H, softball, volleyball, and basketball,
and spent many late summers attending the Burt County Fair. After
high school, Charm advanced her education at Wayne State College,
receiving a bachelor's degree in education.

Charm spent most of her career, 29 years, working for Lincoln Public
Schools with many years at Lincoln NorthStar as a Skills and
Technology teacher. Her work with Skills USA, an organization to
improve the nation's skilled workforce, brought her much joy. Charm
continued mentoring students even after her retirement and traveled
the state encouraging young women to be successful in the industrial
tech field.

Throughout her life Charm was a dedicated athlete, not only
participating in sports but also coaching. From softball to golf, she
stayed active even through cancer treatment. She was a passionate
Huskers volleyball, softball, and football fanï¿½Go Big Red! Charm was
also very involved in United Lutheran Church and spent time
volunteering at the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Charm's family was the center of her life. Time with her mom and dad
on the farm was most important to her and she loved all her family,
cousins and extended family immensely. She had countless friends that
she loved and they adored her. As adults, former students often
visited to thank her and share more about the impact she had on their
lives and success. Family, friends, and former students organized
parades for Charm this past spring. More than 70 cars drove by her
house to wave and express their love and respect.

Charm survived both breast cancer and lymphoma, and was diagnosed
with PML disease in May. With support from her #CharmStrong team, she
met the disease head on. Throughout her life and through her
challenges, Charm set an example for all and always brought the high
fun factor.

Charm is survived by her parents Ray and Jean Satree; siblings Doug
Satree (Jane), Shelly Satree, and Steve Satree; nieces Amy Cook
(Justin) and Katy Satree; aunt Chloe and uncle John Johnson; cousins
Deb Cornell, Roxanne Cornell (Jennifer Polzin), Dane Cornell (Judy),
Jay Johnson (Marlene), Alan Stenvers, Tracy Scow (Chris), Linda
Stenvers (Chris Marisette), and Lisa Preston (Ron); goddaughter
Sidney Scow; great-nephews Jackson and Lane Cook; and many extended
family members and cherished friends. Preceded in death by her
beloved grandparents Lorene and Virgil Lane, and Erling and Ingrid
Satree; aunt Norma and uncle Clancy Cornell, aunt Marilyn and uncle
Dennis Stenvers; and cousin Ron Cornell.

The family wishes to thank the circle of dear friends who cared for
Charm these past months, surrounding her with love and laughter, as
well as the incredible staff at HoriSun Hospice and The Monarch House
who cared for all of us so beautifully, teaching us to let go with
love.

One of Charm's favorite songs, "Crowded Table" by the Highwomen,
truly expresses her love with the chorus, "I want a house with a
crowded table, and a place by the fire for everyoneï¿½"

A celebration of Charm's life will be held at the Uehling Auditorium
(224 Third Street, Uehling, Nebraska 68063) on Saturday, November 14
with an indoor/outdoor visitation beginning at 9:00 a.m., service at
10:00 a.m., and a brief tailgate party to follow. Huskers gear
encouraged, in Charm's honor. Masks required, social distancing
encouraged. Memorials may be sent to The Logan View Education
Foundation, The Burt County Fair Foundation, or United Lutheran
Church in Lincoln.hhw

A Resident Since 1861 Passes Away Suddenly 
 
When word was passed around Friday evening that August Wagner had
been stricken with heart failure and passed away soon afterward, a
sense of deep regret was heard on all sides. His demise was sudden,
as up to that time he had seemed to be enjoying his usual health
and had partaken of a hearty evening meal.  He had risen from the
table and had started for another room when he was stricken, with
death coming a few moments later.

 
The death of this respected and well known man again brings us to
the realization that the ranks of the real pioneers of this section
is rapidly thinning.  In his sixty years' residence in this
community, Mr. Wagner shared the vicissitudes, trials and hardships
of the early settler and had seen this country grow from a land of
unbroken wilds and prairies to one of plenty and prosperity. In
those early days he took a prominent part in the community's
affairs and was a man always ready, and never failing, to do any
task asked of him, and always unselfishly gave his aid to any
friend in time of need.  He had a large acquaintance and among
these he was always held in high esteem. Carl Ludwig August Wagner
was born in Middleschefland, November 7, 1845, and died at Hooper,
Nebr., February 23, 1923, at the age of 77  years, 3 months and 16
days. He came to America in 1852, locating in Ohio and later
removing to Wisconsin.  In 1863 he made the overland trip to
Nebraska and located on a farm near Logan Creek, northeast of the
present site of Hooper. He was united in marriage to Miss Elizabeth
Uehling on October 9, 1868, and thus a union of over fifty-four
years is broken through the death of the husband.  To this sacred
union fifteen children were born, of whom twelve survive.  They are
Henry, Edward, Gilbert, Mrs. Henry Mallette, Mrs. Ben Ott, Mrs.
Herman Janssen, Mrs. Alfred Stroh, and Mrs. Fred Dierking of
Hooper, Mrs. John M. Uehling of Elizabeth, Nebr., Wm. Wagner of
Neligh, Mrs. Isaac Mallette of Craig and Alfred Wagner of Ignacio,
Colo.  A sister, Mrs. Joseph Stecher of Fremont, also survives him.
The funeral services were held at the Zion's Lutheran Church at
1:30 Monday afternoon, the pastor, Rev. J. Schrader, preaching the
words of comfort to the sorrowing family and the large gathering of
friends who had come to thus pay their last respects to a friend
and neighbor. Interment was made in the Hooper cemetery(1).
 
The pall bearers were grandsons of the deceased, Harry Wagner,
Edward, Harold, Lester and Sherman Mallette and Fred Ott, Jr.  Out
of town relatives here for funeral were: Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Wagner of
Neligh, Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Mallette and family of Craig, Mr. and
Mrs. Jos. Stecher of Fremont and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Binger of
Neligh, and Mrs. John Uehling of Elizabeth.hhw

Another Pioneer Woman Answers Final Summons 
 
Again we have been reminded of the frailty of our lives and of the
end of our days, in that one more of our numbers has been summoned
from this earth.  This time the call came to Mrs. August Wagner,
who passed away at 2:50 p.m. last Thursday, October l6, 1924, at
the home of her daughter, Mrs. Alfred Stroh.  The cause of her
death was due to a paralytic stroke she suffered the morning of the
day before. Previous to the stroke, Mrs. Wagner had been in her
usual health and the news of her illness and the shortly following
death brought to her immediate family, relatives and friends a
profound sorrow.
 
Elizabeth Uehling was born in Saxony, Germany, January 10, 1850,
and thus had attained the age of 74 years, 9 months and 10 days.


When a young girl she left the home land and emigrated with her
parents to the United States, the family locating in Dodge County,
Wisconsin. In 1864 they came to Nebraska, settling on a homestead
northeast of the present site of Hooper, and this community had
been her home ever since. On October 9, 1868, she was united in
marriage to August Wagner, and continued to reside on the farm

until twenty-five years ago when she and Mr. Wagner moved to town. 
Mr. Wagner died February 23, 1923, and since then she had made her
home with her daughter, Mrs. Stroh.
 
As a pioneer settler of this vicinity, Mrs. Wagner had gained a
wide acquaintanceship and her friends were legion.  She was a woman
intensely devoted to her home ties, beloved by friends as well as
by her family, never failing to giving her assistance to those
desiring her services and was always held in the highest esteem by
all in the community that had so long been her home.
 
This esteem was attested to Sunday afternoon when an assemblage
that completely filled and overflowed Zions Lutheran Church were
present to pay their last respects to the memory of this beloved
friend and neighbor.  Services at the church were held at two
o'clock and followed brief services at the Stroh home, the pastor,
Rev. G. F. R. Duhrkop, conducting them at both places. The pall
bearers were Lester and Sherman Mallette, Harold and Clifford
Mallette, Fred Ott and Earl Janssen, all grandsons of the deceased.
 
She was the mother of fifteen children, twelve of whom survive.
These are: Henry, Edward, Mrs. Henry Mallette, Mrs. Ben Ott, Mrs.
Herman E. Janssen, Mrs. Alfred Stroh and Mrs. Fred Dierking all of
Hooper and vicinity; Mrs. John M. Uehling, of Elizabeth; William of
Neligh: Mrs. Isaac Mallette of Craig; Alfred of Ignacio, Colo. and
Gilbert of Dodge, all of whom but Alfred were present at the
funeral. She is also survived by one sister, Mrs. John F. Meyer, of
Hooper and fifty grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.hhw

away suddenly at his home at about 10 o'clock Thursday morning.  He
had been in poor health for many years and during the past couple

Harry M. Wagner of Hooper Badly Burned in Blast
 
Explosion Is Cause of Injury to Fire Chief
 
Hooper, Nov. 10 - Harry M. Wagner, chief of the Hooper volunteer
fire department, was seriously burned Sunday morning by a
mysterious explosion in a burning home.
 
The explosion occurred in the Frank H. Nelson home shortly after
11:30 o'clock Sunday morning, when Wagner and other volunteer
firemen were fighting flames that threatened to destroy the
residence.
 
The fire chief was standing on the roof of the kitchen which
adjoins the main building. A window near him was shattered, and
fragments were thrown a distance of 50 feet. The roof of the house
was raised a foot in the air, and when it dropped back the whole
building appeared to bulge out.
 
Wagner sustained burns on the left side of his body and head, his
left eye was closed, and his left hand and arm were painfully
scorched.
 
The cause of the explosion is not known. The fire is believed to
have started in a small clothes closet. The house was heated by a
coal stove, and there was fire in the stove, but there were no
indications that this figured in either the origin of the fire or
the subsequent explosion.
 
Mrs. Nelson and a daughter were at church at the time. The fire was
discovered by Mr. Nelson while he was standing on the street a
short distance away talking to a friend. By the time firemen
arrived the blaze was gaining great headway.
 
Note - This item was typed from a clipping of the newspaper item
and was sent to me by Betty Shaffer McMaster in 1991.
