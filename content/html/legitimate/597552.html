 <br />
Worst: Tie between Freehold (first floor especially) and Yonkers.<br />
 <br />
Rudest Tellers: Philadelphia Park, especially first floor by the paddock.  Couldn't get one of them to crack a smile if you waved a $20 bill in front of their races.  Plus, there's a younger guy there that will rob you blind if you don't count the money you're due as he's handing it out.<br />
 <br />
Most overrated: Saratoga - especially on the back &quot;lawn,&quot; which is mostly just dirt.  How can you have a good time in the heat, in an overcrowded, dusty area?  <br />
 <br />
Best place to picnic: Delaware Park, under the trees...  ;) <br />

<br />
Smelly armpit of racing: Yonkers Raceway<br />
Most confusing grandstand layout (God please let there not be a fire): Hippodrome de Québec<br />
Most beautiful: Arlington, Santa Anita, Monmouth, Belmont (especially the backyard)<br />
Favorite tracks to be at: Philadelphia, Belmont, Sandown Park UK (I like the fact that fans are allowed onto the course itself), Hippodrome de Paris-Vincennes (grandstand resembles a honeycomb)<br />
Tracks that I hate to go to: Saratoga (awful sight lines, hard to watch a race on the first floor), Yonkers (cannot describe this dump with words)<br />
<br />
Just curious &quot;toetoe&quot;. Why would you say that the fans at Lingfield Park are the most knowledgeable? I've been there as well, it's like England's Aqueduct (albeit inner dirt).</div></div><hr />

Haven't tried the dining.  The view of the races is incredible.  The grandstand almost seems to hover directly over the track and I had no problem getting seats opening weekend last spring including at the box office on opening day.<br />
<br />
I go to Saratoga for tradition but if I don't have a seat I don't plan on seeing the races live.  If I do have a seat, I hope that it's not at the top of the stretch.  But I'll be there again this year.</div></div><hr />

   Just bluster.  Wanted to say &quot;Lovely Lingfield.&quot;  Actually, great to bet with bookies, course was over the river and through the woods, very irregular.  That's a good thing; at least that's what Martha told me.  Also, loved the covered walk from the train to the track.  Must be almost a mile long (I may be hallucinating, mind you) and very handy because it's in ENGLAND, where it RAINS.<br />

<br />
Surprised that you didn't say &quot;So so Southwell&quot;.<br />
Covered walk at Lingfield? Only way that you'd be covered is with an umbrella. Was at least a good half-mile. However, it's a mile walking back (after you've lost £).<br />
The time that I went to Lingfield was during the Foot &amp; Mouth Disease crisis. We had to step in disinfectant to enter the course...and then found all of the jockeys wearing polka-dot briefs (true). And you think that YOU were hallucinating!<br />
<br />
BTW, Arapahoe is outside of Denver.</div></div><hr />

It is my home track here in Colorado.  In the middle of nowhere, but trust me when I say that the majority of bettors are clueless (mainly dog players playing the horses).  Too bad the handle isn't higher otherwise I'd be there every day during the meet.<br />
It serves a stepping stone for announcers: Peter Barry, Charles Pinnell, Bill Downes had stints here.  The current one is so bad, he doesn't even call the horses names during the race LOL  :eek: <br />

I haven't been to that many tracks, but I preferred Churchill and River Downs over Keeneland.</div></div><hr />

  It was in 1979.  Maybe the cover (like a mile-long carport) blew over or got urbanly renewed.  That was quite a day.  I had time to walk through Chelsea (sorry, old girl, did I hurt you?), take a boatride to Greenwich, ride the rails to Lingfield and see Dizzy Gillespie's set at Ronny Scott's, a jazz club.  Oh, almost forgot.  Won eight pounds.</div></div><hr />

Sportsman park was a 5/8 oval. No long stretch there. Could you possibly have ben at Hawthorne, which is right next door and does have one of the longest stretches in the U.S.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valuist</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sportsmans was 5/8 until 1992, when they re-built it and made it a 7/8 oval with the longest stretch.  It was a joke of a track, kind of like a stretched out rubber band with 2 hairpin turns and straightaways that were too long.  After an apprentice was killed there in 1991, Lukas said he never send a horse there again (not that he ever did anyways).  He probably said the remark off the cuff, but Spt management took it seriously and had the main track rebuilt.  They didn't bank the turns enough and it was a terrible mistake.  You either won on the lead or from far back if you saved ground.  Stalking 3-4 wide was a trip that could never win.</div></div><hr />

When they changed the track from 5/8 to 7/8 a couple of years ago they knocked all the fences &amp; barriers and tried to make it more of a park like setting with benches and no fences.  They made some improvements but like you said its O.K.<br />

I haven't been there in a long time, but I was new to the area (and relatively new to racing in general) when I went there.  I couldn't compare it with the other tracks I listed from the standpoint of scenery or quality of stock, but I think it was a combination of the French influence, the company I was keeping at the time, and the results of my wagering.  If I went back there now, I might feel totally differently.</div></div><hr />

The amount of knowledge of horseracing is far better than any handicapping forums I've read. I feel like I'm sitting in the grandstand with a bunch of racetrackers listening in on their choices.<br />
 <br />
I rode or trained at cheap tracks in the 80's and early 90's,so my choices here are based on tracks I've been to.<br />
 <br />
All time favorite place: mass. fairs, for the simple reason that the fans were so into the races. They are actually out on the apron cheering as you're coming down the stretch!<br />
 <br />
Fort Erie,for the same reasons above but nicer horses and a beautiful facility.<br />
 <br />
least favorite: Keystone, fans would throw things at the riders who didn't ride to their expectations.(I had the bug there and was lucky that my rides performed according to form,but I still got hit by a few poorly aimed shots!heh heh)<br />

 <br />
Ak-Sar-Ben: Surprised it hasn't come up. Was great. Nothing like hitting winners in the p.m. and heading to Johnny's in the Stockyards for steak after.. A tragedy that it's gone.<br />
 <br />
Belmont: Always comfortable. Palatial. Where else can 100,000 fit without feeling crowded?<br />
 <br />
Aqueduct: I've always liked the Big A. Sitting with the rastas in Little Kingston. &quot;Hey Santos mon.. You stink.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Meadowlands: A little too &quot;new&quot; for my taste, but well done.<br />
 <br />
Monmouth: A delight. The most under-rated, under-appreciated track in the US.<br />
 <br />
Laurel: Anxious to see the reno. Was basically a MD version of Monmouth.<br />
 <br />
Pimlico: Slovenly.. Pathetic.. A mess.. Wonderful.<br />
 <br />
Gulfstream: Let you know next year... Was quite nice.<br />
 <br />
Fairgrounds: Dripping with atmosphere. <br />

Arlington: The model for any new facility. Glorious.<br />

Churchill: Great Derby Week, depressing nearly any other time. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Latonia&quot; (RD): Fun. Jaunty. Haven't been there in ages.<br />
 <br />
Vancouver (Exhibition Park?): $750 claimers the night I was there. Never had seen a race before in which I had enough pocket money to buy a participant.<br />

Bluebonnets: Only for simulcast. Lived in MTL 10 years... Had fun here. &quot;Un steamie, tout garni, un Molson Export, s.v.p... Merci.&quot;<br />

<br />
I been wanting to go see a card at the Northampton fair for years but never made it.  What ever happened to the Great Barrington Fair ?<br />
<br />
ZAFONIC<br />
<br />
The Northampton Fair races is quite cool. You should go at least once there Zafonic. Thoroughbreds over a ½ mile track with full fields (8 is as full as you're gonna get there). You feel like you can litterally touch the horses on the backstretch. Pools are quite decent too. Besides, where else can you bet on the 7th race sponsored by &quot;Ed's French Fries&quot;?<br />
<br />
If you haven't made it to the Great Barrington Fair, then you never will. Track was razed by a hurricane, built back up and survived only two more seasons before going under after the 2000 season. The grounds were bought by developers. Oddest thing about that ½ mile track was that it was shaped like a round square. The turns actually had straights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garyoz</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worst Track:  Hazel Park in suburban Detroit, 5/8th of a mile bullring that ran flats from the early 50's until the early 1980's.  Also where I (mis) spent my youth.  Now only a harness track.<br />
<br />
Best Tracks:  More the rule than the exception, I've found something unique or different to like about most tracks that I have visited (more than a dozen of them).</div></div><hr />

I believe that's in quality of stock. Also it's extremely hard to wager there since BRD has rolling pick 3's, exactas, quinellas, trifectas &amp; superfectas in every race. <br />
<br />
So what's the problem with that you say? Well, for a 10 race card they'll usually handle for the entire day about $100,000. The average superfecta pool usually fails to crack the lofty $300 barrier and the pick 3 pool often will not reach the plateau of ten bucks. Trifectas get most of the money there with pools between $1500 and $2000 a race.</div></div><hr />

Northampton sounds like fun,  but straight aways on turns , boy I would of loved  to have seen that.<br />

They haven't hit 80,000 for total amount bet over 10 races in several years.  I once bet $15 on a horse there last year and would up dropping the odds from 20:1 to 4:1.  Hopefully things will pick up with the Choctaws buying the track and adding slots.</div></div><hr />

Most trainers would make sure their horses had a gallop around it at least once before running. Some horses would switch to their right lead the first time they encountered it. After almost falling on their butts trying to regroup to make the second corner,they didn't switch leads the next time they saw it! It was useful if you were riding a strong,fearless horse. A rider could jump into the hole at the rail, take the hit from the outside horse and end up 3 infront coming out of the turn. The outside horse and rider will take a second or two to regroup because they didn't know the hit was coming.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Twice I ran a horse slightly out of his conditions just because I wanted an &quot;Ed's French Fries&quot; cooler.(fleece horse blanket) I caught a bear both times and ran 2nd. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Northampton's a great time for horsemen and players. It's the closest action you'll probably ever see. The website for NH has a head-on shot of the horses entering the first turn. I'm on the horse in front. <br />

 <br />
I'm not bragging here,the horse lost and it's tough to brag when your 'claim to fame' is Erie Downs and the Mass Fairs!</div></div><hr />

It sits in Industrial hell right outside Midway airport. So when the planes aren't drowning your visual senses out, the smoke from the plants are killing your sense of smell. SO I guess if your deaf and have no sense of smell, it would be ok.<br />
<br />
GaryOZ mentioned Hazel Park. Alot has changed since the mid 80's. They tore down the old grandstands and now have a state of the art facility. Its one to die for. Windsor Raceway (Harness) is one of the worst tracks I've been too.<br />
<br />
I like Balmoral and Turfway Park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valuist</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But Hawthorne has some of the biggest field sizes and median payouts.  It definitely isn't pretty to look at, but I like the way they run their track.</div></div><hr />

Ak-Sar-Ben: Surprised it hasn't come up. Was great. Nothing like hitting winners in the p.m. and heading to Johnny's in the Stockyards for steak after.. A tragedy that it's gone. <br />
<br />
I loved Ak-sar-ben, was my home track and I was groom there for a few years.  Worked for O.D. Kemling (remember Amadevil and Roman Zipper?)<br />
Next to Saratoga, had the most beautiful backstretch that I've seen.<br />
<br />
Why go all the way down to Johnny's when Ross's and Misty's Steak House so close.  Ever try Paltani's tacos.  They're all closed now, sad.  If you get a chance check out this website dedicated to Ak-Sar-ben.  <br />

Worst track,<br />
<br />
After spending the summer at Ak Lincoln fair was always a shock to me.  I literally walkout after a few races my first visit there.  I even think Adokad was a nicer track.</div></div><hr />
