                  <h2 style="">Conduct of Interview:</h2>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">During the course of the Oral History Program's interviews on social action and civil rights, numerous people recommended
                     that Margolis be interviewed. In March of 1984 the program approached Margolis, and he consented to participate.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In preparing for the interview, Balter studied Margolis's cases, his FBI file, and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> clipping file. In addition, he reviewed relevant Oral History Program interviews and consulted published sources on such
                     topics as the Hollywood blacklist.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The interview follows a chronological format, beginning with Margolis's childhood, the Margolis family's move to California,
                     continuing on to his education and legal career. The bulk of the interview focuses on Margolis's political involvements and
                     on the major cases in which he participated.
                  </p>

                  <p class="padded">Most of the interview sessions were spaced fairly close together. The six-month hiatus resulted from Margolis's work on <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>Stabach.</i></p>

                  <p class="noindent">Emma Gee, editor, edited the interview. She checked the verbatim transcript of the interview against the original tape recordings,
                     edited for punctuation, paragraphing, and spelling, and verified proper names. Words and phrases inserted by the editor have
                     been bracketed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In February 1987, the edited transcript was sent to Margolis who reviewed and approved it. He made some corrections and additions
                     and returned the manuscript in the summer of the same year. Michael Balter provided invaluable assistance in verifying the
                     many names and legal cases cited in the interview.

                     to begin at the beginning or before the beginning. I wonder if you could start off telling me some things about your family,
                     when or where you were born, and so on.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. My father [Samuel Margolis] was born in Latvia, Russia, and came over to the United States after the 1905 Revolution
                     in the Soviet—in what was then Russia. My mother [Anna Gerwits Margolis] was born in a place called Bialystok, which is in
                     an area which historically has at times been part of Russia and at other times part of Poland. At present it is part of Russia.
                     She came over here to the United States about the same time, or shortly after, my father came here. I'm not sure of the year,
                     but it was about 1906, 1907, that they came over. Both settled in New York. Met and were married in New York in 1907, 1908—I
                     don't know the exact date.

                  <p class="noindent">My father was a painter, a house painter. He was a radical, as was my mother. Neither of them were religious Jews. As a matter
                     of fact, I think it would be correct to say that they were both atheists, at least agnostics if not atheists—probably atheists.
                     My father worked as— We lived on the East Side of New York, and my father worked as a painter. Became a member of the painters
                     union in New York City. His principal organizational connection was with an organization known as the IWO, the International

                     in kindergarten at the age of about five and a half in New York. My mother and father gradually spoke more and more English,

                     we lived. I went to school there until I was seven years old.

                     that was involved, and they both wanted to get away from that. And there was a terrible reaction after the 1905 Revolution,
                     which caused them both to leave. My father had an additional reason: that is, he was about to be taken into the military service,

                     and whether he could make a living. Then came back and brought my mother and I out, and I had my seventh birthday on the train

                     there for almost exactly a year and, during that year, my asthmatic condition greatly improved. As a matter of fact, almost
                     disappeared, and within a few years thereafter, completely disappeared. So that whether living in Sierra Madre did it or not,
                     I did get over the asthma in a rather short period of time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I went to school there. Had my first contact with a way of life that was entirely strange to me when I came out here. I had
                     a Buster Brown haircut, which was the kind of thing you had for your boy children in New York City, and wore white shoes and
                     white little pants and all that sort of thing. And then I went to school here in Sierra Madre. The first day I got beaten
                     up by guys with bare feet and overalls, or, you know, pants and shirt. I remember that my father finally took me and got me
                     a haircut and let me get a different kind of clothes—all of which greatly distressed my mother—and I began gradually to become
                     a California.

                     a girl, had a girl's haircut, and that kind of thing. But whether or not there was any underlying anti-Semitism, I can't be
                     sure, but I rather doubt it. As a matter of fact, I must say that I have not in my lifetime directly experienced a great deal
                     of anti-Semitism, although I have been aware of a great deal of it, with respect to others.

                  <p class="noindent">I think perhaps one of the reasons why there wasn't a display of anti-Semitism was because the feeling against the Germans
                     was so high. The Germans were simply not safe on the streets there. Of course, there weren't any real Germans, but there were

                  <p class="noindent">Well, Sierra Madre is still a small place, but it was much smaller then. I don't remember the population, but it was a really
                     very small place. My family wanted to move to a somewhat larger place. My mother had a sister [Jennie Aronow] who lived in
                     Santa Barbara and I think— Again, you want to remember that, at that age, I wasn't in very much on the decision making. But
                     I think— I'm sure one of the reasons we moved to Santa Barbara was that my mother's sister was there, and also there was work
                     there for my father. He again went out and looked over the place before we moved. And he did, when he was in— By the time
                     he got to Santa Barbara, at least at some point, he started working for himself as an individual contractor, rarely hiring
                     anybody but occasionally, very occasionally. Being his own boss, doing his own work, and, again, making a modest living.

                  <p class="noindent">I really don't know. You want to remember that before I became— They were not in this country, and so there were no grandparents
                     to introduce me to. I was very young, and I guess they didn't talk to me much about that kind of thing. My belief is that
                     they died or were killed or something happened along those lines. But they were not in contact with them for one reason or
                     another after that. At some point when I was very young, I think that happened.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, there were some other relatives on my father's side, who came to New York after we had already gone to California. I've
                     had very minimal contact with them. My father and they didn't get along very well. They were very conservative. Came here
                     and went into business. They didn't see eye to eye. My father was just not interested in having any relationship. Occasionally,
                     we'd hear from them and they would hear from us, but there was never any real relationship established.

                     very close. She was also a radical person.

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I think I was nine years old by the time we moved, or close to nine. We lived in Santa Barbara together until 1926. So it
                     was about 1919 when we moved there, and we lived there together until 1926. In May, I think it was, of 1926, my mother died
                     from infection following surgery involving a miscarriage. In the meantime, my brother [Harry Margolis] had been born. He was
                     born in, let's see, October of 1920. My birthday's in April, so he's about nine and a half years younger than I am. And when
                     I graduated from high school, I went through— Finished grammar school, went through junior high school and high school in
                     Santa Barbara, and I graduated in 1926 when I was sixteen years old. I graduated a month or so after my mother died. My father,
                     then, together with my brother, who was then between six and seven years old, shortly after my mother's death, within two
                     or three months, moved to San Francisco. I think his motivation was that it was very hard for him to work and to take care
                     of my brother, and he wanted to remarry. Felt it was necessary for him to have a home for my brother, and there was no— He
                     wouldn't have, although he wasn't— There wasn't anything political about it. It wouldn't have even occurred to him to have
                     married anyone who wasn't Jewish, not because of any religious reasons or anything like that. But I guess he would never have
                     been comfortable with anyone else, and there were no opportunities of that kind in Santa Barbara. (There were only a few Jewish
                     families in Santa Barbara.) So he moved to San Francisco with my brother and did—oh, about a year after my mother's death—did
                     get remarried to my stepmother [Etta Boyarski Margolis], who then raised my brother. I stayed on in Santa Barbara.

                     at the counter—taking in telegrams and doing clerical work—at seventy-five dollars a month, which was enough to live on, quite
                     comfortably, at that time.

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, after my mother's death, my father and I and my brother had moved into a boardinghouse in Santa Barbara, where we had
                     rooms and our meals at the boardinghouse. When my father and brother left, I stayed on at this boardinghouse. I think my room
                     and board was thirty-five or forty dollars a month— something like that—and took care of my laundry and everything. So I was
                     in pretty good shape as far as getting by financially was concerned.

                  <p class="noindent">I entered Santa Barbara—I think it was called—[State] Teachers College then. It later became Santa Barbara State [College,
                     1935], and later became University of California, Santa Barbara [1958]. At the time I went to school there, it was up on the
                     hills, the Riviera, in Santa Barbara. Later, it moved out to Goleta and became a much larger school. I went to school there
                     for two years, working all of that time at the Western Union Telegraph Company. Making seventy-five dollars a month and supporting
                     myself quite comfortably.

                  <p class="noindent">I was very ambitious at that time. I also for two years, during the Christmas season when we had Christmas vacation, went
                     into business selling Christmas trees and made some extra money. I saw my father, brother, and stepmother only during the
                     Christmas season. I remember the last Christmas Eve I ran to catch the train, going from my business. Took a night train to
                     San Francisco and then spent the next week or so there, until school started. Came back to Santa Barbara. So that I guess
                     I was very, very busy. I was going to school from eight to four and working from four to twelve. But I had a job where I could
                     do some studying on the job. If it wasn't busy at the counter, I could sit and do some studying. So it really wasn't very

                     me. Later on, there was a third family that moved in with a person about our age, and the name was [Herbert] Motto. I can't
                     think of his first name. We were always together. We were the only— Close friends. Again, I didn't directly feel the anti-Semitism,
                     although I suppose some of it was there. On the other hand, I had some pretty good friends in school, although not socially,
                     who were not Jewish. So again, I think there was some anti-Semitism present, but it wasn't overt and very troublesome. So,
                     I stayed on for the two years. The Santa Barbara State [Teachers] College was only a two-year college at that time, but you
                     could get credit to go into a university.

                  <p class="noindent">In the meantime, Max Hein, the one who was older than I was— Well, you might be interested in a little bit about their families.
                     George Snavice's father was a peddler. He got fruits and vegetables, and peddled them around neighborhoods. And he had several,
                     several, several kinds— In business for himself, so to speak, in that kind of an area. Max Hein's father was sort of one of
                     the best-off Jews in town. He had an army and navy store after the war. He did very well, so that he had acquired some property,
                     which our family didn't. I might mention one other thing. Before my mother died, we lived for a while in an area called Mission
                     Canyon and— Oh, while we were living on the Riviera, my mother worked as a waitress at a hotel called the El Encanto Hotel,

                  <p class="noindent">El Encanto Hotel. It was <i>the</i> swank hotel in Santa Barbara at that time, and she did quite well there. Evenings, I used to very often go there with her
                     and sit in the kitchen and read. I was an avaricious reader, read book after book. I'd have dinner there very often, and all
                     sorts of goodies, in the kitchen—she worked there.

                  <p class="noindent">Then we moved to this Mission Canyon area and built a small grocery store there, which my mother ran and which I helped out
                     in. It was a very tiny, very tiny place. Never made much money, but it made a little money to supplement my father's income.
                     And, as I say, during this period also I— I never remember any period that, at least as far as I knew, we were in want, but
                     we never had a lot of money. As a matter of fact, my father about 1924 bought a Model T Ford, which not everybody owned at
                     that time. It was a secondhand one, but nevertheless, he had a car. Of course he used it in his business, but he had that.
                     So that was pretty much my life there.

                     a very lovely area: lots of trees and a nice residential area, but middle-class homes, then. I don't know what they cost at
                     that time, but now you'd say homes that would cost today maybe $75,000. Of course it cost a tiny fraction of that at that

                  <p class="noindent">On one occasion I was passing an automobile—there were streetcar tracks—my wheels got caught in between the track and the
                     road, you know, in that space there. Threw me off the bike, right in front of a car that went over me, without touching me.
                     And I remember I went on to school that day. I was bruised. I went on to school that day, and then I came home and told my
                     mother about it. And my bike was smashed. I remember she put me to bed for two or three days, even though I had gone to school.
                     I came out of it all right. But I remember that as one of the scary moments of my life: flying over the handlebars in front
                     of the car. Would happen today you'd be—if anyone—you'd be dead. Cars at that time were quite high.

                     I was probably fourteen years old. I was a good student. School was easy for me, and I enjoyed school. I always liked it and
                     I was particularly— I read constantly—all the time. When I worked for Western Union Telegraph Company, I suppose out of the

And I read <i>hunks</i> of the <i>Book of Knowledge</i> at one point. Then I read all of Jack London; I became very fond of Jack London. And then I read some of the classics at
                     a later stage when I was in high school. I wasn't at that stage reading anything political, but I was reading many, many,
                     quite, quite good books as well as a lot of junk. I loved mystery stories and things of that kind. I read almost anything.

                     when my friends and I would generally get together with other fellows, and we'd go out raiding, knocking over outhouses. We
                     were very destructive in those days during Halloween—much more destructive—and did all kinds of things. People more or less
                     expected it and, to a considerable extent, accepted it. Why? I don't know. Dirty up, soap up cars, and do all kinds of things

                  <p class="noindent">It was a country village then. Well, Santa Barbara had about thirty thousand people, but there were, I remember, areas where
                     we grew watermelons. We used to go steal watermelons and sit on the curb and throw the rinds of watermelons at passing cars.
                     I don't know why we did this, but these were the sort of things that kids were doing at that time. Fortunately, we weren't

                     whose name I don't recall now, who was kind of motherly in her approach to me. But also, particularly the families of my two

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. She was living there during the two years my father was gone. She and my father had had a falling-out, and it apparently
                     extended over to me. I saw them only occasionally. She had one son, Albert, last name Aronow, which was her first husband's
                     name. At that time, her first husband had died and she was married to a tailor by the name of Pasman. She was very tall. My
                     mother was a tall woman. My mother was possibly six feet—very tall. But Jennie was maybe six feet two; I'm not sure, but she
                     was over six feet. She was taller than my mother and a very big woman. I would see them only occasionally.

                     that time, I was active in dramatics and on the debating team of the school. In connection with the dramatics, I got an opportunity
                     to participate in a play at the art theater, the Lobero Theater. I think it's spelled L-O-B-E-R-O Theater. I remember the
                     name of a play for reasons that will become apparent. It was <i>Caesar and Cleopatra</i> [by George Bernard Shaw], and it was directed by a man by the name of [Irving] Pichel, who, many years later, I represented
                     as one of the Hollywood Nineteen, later reduced to the Hollywood Ten.

                     moving just with himself and the younger son, my brother. All and all, it just seemed the right thing to do. I do remember

                  <p class="noindent">Well, my mother was by far the stronger person in the relationship. She was a very strong woman, who was the one who sort
                     of controlled the money and was even more businesslike than my father and— She pretty much ran things. They were very much
                     in agreement on their political outlook on life, which was Left. They were in agreement as to the friends they liked and those
                     they didn't like. I remember, for example, while we were living in Santa Barbara, the Jews there formed a small synagogue
                     shul. They were urged to join, and they refused. They said that they just didn't believe in that. I'm not sure they were right,
                     by the way, looking at it now. But at any event they were very firm in that, and I remember that there was no disagreement
                     between them at all.

                     my father to do a little more. She was the one who, for example, as I remember, when we built the store in Mission Canyon,
                     she was the leader of that. It was her idea. She

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I had <i>no</i> religious upbringing. I didn't go through the usual ceremonies, for example. I had no education in Hebrew or in any— None,
                     none of it. I wasn't bar mitzvahed, which was almost looked upon as a crime in those days, and I guess [by] most Jewish people
                     now. I, as I look back on it, I think maybe that wasn't altogether the best thing, but I'm not sure. I know that I did the
                     same thing with my own children. Although in the case of my children, my wife wasn't Jewish. But in any event, I was never
                     told I <i>couldn't</i> do any of these things. I was just never required to do them. Not being required to do them, I had no interest in doing those
                     things. So I didn't learn some things that might have been useful for me to learn if they had pushed me into it.

                     my father about politics, but no point of view was ever pushed on me by my parents. I don't mean that I wasn't affected by
                     their views, but no one said this is what you ought to believe and this is what you ought to do. There was not that kind of
                     compulsion on me.

                     father— You had mentioned earlier that he was in the painters union in New York. Was he in the union in Santa Barbara, for

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, he continued to be in the union. I think he was a union member all of his life. Continued to be a union member, and he
                     supported the union, although he was very critical of the union. His political activities were within the IWO, and they— The
                     point is that when we lived in Sierra Madre and Santa Barbara, there really wasn't much opportunity for him to get involved
                     in any kind of politics. Now, when he moved to San Francisco, there was an IWO branch there that he joined. He used to go
                     to meetings. He became a member of a Jewish chorus. (He had a very good voice, sang very well.) So, while he was in San Francisco,
                     he participated in that way in left-wing organizational activities. As far as I know, not while he was in either Sierra Madre
                     or Santa Barbara.

                     tires, you were doing exceedingly well. But we went there, and they had some friends there.

                     a fairly long trip at that time. So we didn't do very much traveling.

                     the wife of Mike [Michael] Wilson, who is one of the blacklisted writers, and the other one [Sylvia Gussom] was the wife of
                     a very close friend of mine, also, Paul Jarrico. That is not surprising because the reason we traveled so far as thirty miles
                     for a relationship is because this was a Jewish, progressive, I guess, left-wing family. There wasn't anybody like that in
                     Santa Barbara, so we occasionally used to go to Santa Paula, and they occasionally used to come to Santa Barbara on the thirty-mile
                     trip, which took a couple of hours each way.

                  <p class="noindent">And then in '29, I went to University of Southern California. The reason I happened to go to USC was that my friend Max Hein
                     had gone up there a year ahead, yeah, a year ahead of me, and entered pharmacy school there. He had joined a fraternity, Tau
                     Epsilon Phi, a Jewish fraternity. You want to remember I didn't have many friends of my own age, at least no close friends.
                     And he induced me to come to USC and to join the fraternity and live in the fraternity house, which is one of the silly things
                     I did in my life. But it gave me a base, you know, with the only people I knew and I was accepted. I had friends and companions.

                     '27, September of '28, and this was just before the Depression. And I got a job. See, I still had to support myself.

                  <p class="noindent">I got a job with the Western Union Telegraph Company, as a result of my work in Santa Barbara—in their accounting department.
                     I got a job, as a matter of fact, in a— I worked in a basement pulling out copies of telegrams that they needed. Copies of
                     telegrams would be stored there, and then they'd need it because there was a claim of a rate error or some other error, or
                     some other reason for getting it—somebody wanted to check way back. I became quite proficient at that. I had a forty-hour-a-week
                     job, but actually worked pretty much by myself. Was able to do it in about thirty hours a week or twenty-eight hours a week,
                     and got away with that. So I had what was a good job. I was making, still, seventy-five dollars a [month]. And I think, again,
                     I was living in the fraternity for forty dollars a week, I mean, a month. Seventy-five a month for forty dollars a month.

                  <p class="noindent">Then sometime in '29, things began to go bad before the stock market collapsed. And with Western Union Telegraph Company,
                     things began to go bad. I had very low seniority, and I was let go. I had managed to get along fine, but I never saved any
                     money. Well, I saved money when I was in Santa Barbara to pay my tuition and for my books, which wasn't very much at that
                     time at USC. But then here, all of a sudden, I'm without a job. It was lucky I was in the fraternity house because I had lived
                     there for several months without— Paying only part. I got odd jobs: I did tutoring, and I worked as an extra in a number of
                     movies. Those were the two main things, tutoring and working as an extra in movies. But I wasn't making any seventy-five dollars
                     a month. I was probably making fifty dollars a month or forty-five dollars a month,

                     company had been not uninteresting; I hadn't minded it. This [job] was just terrible. I suppose each ten-hour day was like

                     good. I continued to live at home, although I spent a large part of the time in an apartment where a close friend of mine—went

                  <p class="noindent">I entered Hastings law school [University of California, Hastings College of the Law] there. So that after being out of school
                     a year, one of the reasons— There were several reasons why I entered Hastings: One was it was called "the poor man's Boalt
                     Hall." (Boalt Hall is the [University of California] Berkeley law school.) And you went to school at Hastings— Virtually everybody
                     who went to school at Hastings worked. You went to school six days a week, carried fifteen units, and you went three days
                     from eight to ten, or three days from eight to eleven. Anyway, you were out no later than eleven every morning. I used to
                     go either at ten or eleven directly to my job at the Western Union Telegraph Company, and get home seven or eight o'clock
                     at night from that. So that's what enabled me to go back into school. Another reason why I went there is because it was in
                     San Francisco. There was no tuition, or if there was tuition, it was almost nothing. It was a state school. All you needed
                     was like twenty-five, thirty dollars for books for the year.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I went through three years of law school there. I worked all of the time. Graduated number two in my class. Found law school,
                     except for the first semester when I had a great deal of trouble adjusting, I found law school quite easy. I was able really
                     without great difficulty to work and go to school and do other things as well. Although, again, I wasn't politically active,
                     I had not as yet become politically active. Although by that time I was <i>thinking</i> much more politically than I had been previously.

                     State Teachers College] and one year at USC. And that was another reason I went there. If I had gone to US[C]— I had originally
                     planned to go to USC law school, but I would have had— Well, I would have still graduated at the same time because I would
                     have stayed in school. I suppose if it hadn't been for the Depression, that's probably what would have happened.

                     to have your own car) and had money to spend (they spent more on little things than my income was for a month). They were
                     really not interested in anything except having a good time. I belonged to the debating team, for example, while I was in
                     school there. I was the only one in the whole fraternity. Well, there were a lot of bright young kids there, but I was the
                     only one who had any interest in doing things of that kind. There were some athletes. We had some athletes in the house. I

                     my year there—and the social events. But they were really very good to me. They would take me out on the dates and I wouldn't
                     have to pay anything towards the car and things like that. So in a way, I got opportunities that I wouldn't have had any other
                     way. But by the end of the year, I knew that if I went back to USC I would not live at the fraternity house. That I knew,
                     although I stayed friendly with many of the people. But none of them ever did anything of the kind I was interested in.

                     Schapp. I didn't work for him really. I had office space with him and did work for him in exchange for my space. I never really

                     me to marry their daughter. Now, I just wasn't, I just wasn't really interested. One of the things that happened is that Max
                     and I, while we remained very friendly throughout our lives, grew very much apart politically. Now, he was never a

                     person, but that's about it. So, we had very little in common. And this family was an apolitical family, and Phyllis was an
                     apolitical person. By this time I was already becoming quite a political person from the standpoint of, at least, of my interest
                     if not my knowledge. And she just didn't interest me. She just wasn't that kind. Although when my wife [Valerie Kayly Margolis]
                     and I married, it wasn't particularly political either, but my wife went along more with what I was doing than— I knew that
                     family would expect me to establish a conservative practice, and they were ready to set me up and help me do that. And I wanted
                     no part of that. So I introduced—at one stage I introduced her [Phyllis Schapp] to Max Hein, and they went for each other
                     and got married. [laughter] Had a son, Jared. They were married for many years, and she died of skin cancer about twenty-five
                     years ago. She died at quite a young age. Again, as I say, we remained friendly, but not close after those years. George,
                     I rarely saw. Again, he was totally apolitical. What happened was that all these friends— Except for Myer Symonds, who I pulled
                     into the political thing and he went along in a very big way, except for him, I just lost interest in my friends because we
                     had nothing in common. My life was different than that. You know, when Max and I were going out looking for girls and that
                     kind of thing, I was, you know— That was no longer [laughs] my main interest in life, and so we very much grew apart.

                     of them, I was reasonably friendly. I remember I went to one reunion—our twenty-year reunion—and I decided that I'd never
                     go again because it was just so dull, so uninteresting so far as I was concerned. And the people were so interested in so
                     much different and so many different things. Boasting how they have even cheated clients out of fees, you know. It was not
                     something that— I don't mean that all of them were that way, but that's one of the things that concerned me. None of them
                     had any concern beyond their own immediate welfare: how well they were doing in the practice, how they could get ahead, and
                     so forth.

                     he was in school. I may be confusing things, and I want to be sure it was him. But I think it was him. He married some older

                     came from a well-to-do family. This other person, whose name I don't recall, had gone to Harvard for a year. I think he flunked

                     and Myer Symonds and I, the first time we took the bar, which was in 1933, when they passed the lowest percentage of those

                  <p class="noindent">I remember him particularly, because I had no money and he had money. Later, on my first case, my first contingent case, I
                     didn't have money to finance the case, so I went to him to see if he would help me because I knew he had money. He loaned
                     me, I think, $300, some such amount, to finance the case. And in exchange took half of my fee in addition to the return of
                     his $300: something which I've always resented. I won the case. I then got an $1,800 recovery. He got back his $300. My fee
                     was, I think, $600, and he got, I think, 40 percent of— No, either 40 percent or half, I think half. So I made $300, and he
                     made $300 for loaning me $300. And I never spoke to him again after that. [laughter]

                     school—was a fellow by the name of [Robert W.] Harrison, who was chief deputy attorney general of the state. Our classes were
                     in the state building, and his offices were upstairs. And he had actually run the attorney general's office for many years.

                     even taught anymore. The course was sales, which is now really a part of contracts, but in those days, it was a separate course.
                     I remember we had a textbook, and we took the first case in the textbook. We spent about 80 percent of the semester on that
                     one case: analyzing it and learning what made it tick and everything. By the time we finished that, the rest of the cases
                     were easy. We went through the rest of the cases in a matter of a few weeks—two or three weeks. But I remember that he— Well,
                     he was a very reactionary guy. He was a guy who, from the standpoint of just legal thinking, had the finest mind of anyone

                     And so I think the general approach to this, by most of the people of the school, was simply they wanted to get out of the
                     school and make a living. At that time, making a living was a pretty desirable objective.

                  <p class="noindent">Probably looking at it from today's perspective now— Nowadays, there are a lot of attorneys who start law school and they
                     have this idea that they're going to be, what we call, a public interest attorney. Now, we even have internships and programs,

                     at that time. You want to remember that law didn't play nearly as important a part in our society as it does today. I'm sure
                     the programs and number of lawyers was very much lower than it is today. Law was, as compared today, relatively simple. You
                     went out to practice law. You practiced virtually every aspect of law except maybe patent law. Even tax law wasn't that complicated
                     at that time. So that lawyers were much more generalists, and their basic social concepts of the functions and purposes of
                     law had not developed very much.

                     there wasn't that much direct trade union work. There was some, but there wasn't that much. But if you represented a trade
                     union, then you were doing work for its members: you were representing the little guy. That's what you thought of—of doing
                     some work for the union. But there really at that time was very little concept of many lawyers who really could practice law
                     just representing unions, just doing what we now call labor work. That developed during the time I was very—

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I was working at the time, as I worked all through law school, for the Western Union Telegraph Company in their accounting
                     department, and I continued on that job. In my spare time, I studied for the bar examination, which was given I believe in
                     August, but I'm not sure of the month. In any event, several months after I graduated—that was in 1933. And this was the depth
                     of the Depression. Things were very bad for lawyers generally. In November or December, the list of those who passed came
                     out, and I was among them. They passed the lowest percentage of students in the history of the bar, before or since, 29 percent
                     of those who took it. Of course, the reason for it was that they had already many more lawyers than could make a living. This
                     was sort of a closed shop operation: they were trying to keep the number of lawyers down.

                  <p class="noindent">But, in any event, I was admitted and I was sworn in. I believe it was in December, but it could have been late November of
                     1933. Right after I was admitted, I obtained office space right near the place where I was working for the Western Union Telegraph
                     Company, just kitty-corner across the street. I remember on the sixth floor of the De Young Building, with a man by the name

                  <p class="noindent">No, I do not. I think it was Sam [Donald], but I'm not positive. In any event, I never did any legal work for him because
                     he didn't have any. My assistance to him consisted of going down from the sixth floor to the first floor to the cigar stand—they
                     had a lot of cigar stands at that time in San Francisco—and getting him cigars.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In the meantime, I was continuing to work part-time at the Western Union Telegraph Company. I continued that for almost a
                     year, something less than a year, working out— I had a very good arrangement where I could work almost when I wanted to, but
                     that was my major income.

                  <p class="noindent">At the end of six months, my employer, the one who had given me the office space, jumped out of the sixth-floor window and
                     was killed. He committed suicide, which, by the way, was the sort of thing that was going on. It was quite prevalent in those
                     days. This was a man whose life had been destroyed. You know, he was a comfortable middle-class lawyer who, all of a sudden,
                     had nothing. And literally nothing—I'm not exaggerating—he just had nothing. He lost his entire practice. Had no place to
                     go to get any new practice: there wasn't any.

                  <p class="noindent">During that period of time, I think I made in the first six months, I think I made something like $250 out of my law practice,
                     which consisted of handling a couple of divorces that I managed to get ahold of, at $50 a piece.

                     appointed as trustee and that was merely a nominal job. It wasn't really practicing law, but it brought in a few dollars.

                     was very little.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, he [Ben K. Lehrer] lent me the money for the case, and I paid him back that money when I won the case plus half of my

                     should have seen the hole. But I got a judgment for $1,800, which was quite a lot of money in those days. I think I had it
                     on a 40-percent basis. So for me, I made several hundred dollars even after giving half the, you know, fee, well, which was
                     my first big fee. I was also continuing to do the trustee work and some occasional divorces.

                     There was then going on the Tom Mooney case [<i>Ex parte Mooney</i>], in which the supreme court of the state of California had granted a very unusual kind of writ. As a matter of a fact, I'd

                     [Frank C. Walsh, John F. Finerty, and George T. Davis] filed [a] writ [of <i>coram nobis</i>] with the [California] Supreme Court and it granted the writ. The supreme court had appointed a special master to take evidence
                     and report back to the supreme court. The claim was that Mooney had been convicted on perjured, unfair evidence and so forth,
                     and that the district attorney [Charles M. Fickert] had conspired to use that kind of evidence.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I went up and talked to George Davis about it and volunteered my services. The hearing had been completed by that time. I
                     was not present at any part of the hearing, but there was a transcript, a written transcript. I remember when I first went
                     in, I think it wasn't quite ready. When it was ready, what I did was I analyzed the transcript. I dictated from the transcript
                     the substance of what was in it, on a volunteer basis. And I worked for I don't remember how long, but for a number of months,
                     several hours a day, summarizing this transcript which was, I don't know, twenty thousand pages or something, some such figure.

                  <p class="noindent">At that point, through doing that I also got involved with George Davis, in helping him on some of his litigation. I remember
                     only one of the cases that I tried with him. (When I say "I tried it with him," I sat in court and took notes and was sort
                     of a, you know, a gofer—did a little bit more than that.) There was a cattle-stealing case, [laughter] and Davis represented
                     a man charged with stealing several heads of cattle. He was acquitted. I remember that, I don't remember any of the other
                     details of the case.

                     my hands, I want to help."

                  <p class="noindent">I said, "I'll help without money."</p>

                  <p class="noindent">He put me to work. Although I, that was not— I really wanted to help and get involved, but as a result, I got some work, because
                     I was paid, you see. George Davis was paid something for the <i>Mooney</i> case, but not very much. On the other matters that I worked with him, he was getting his regular fees and he paid me. I don't
                     remember again how much, but reasonably for work. I got some work as a result of it.

                  <p class="noindent">But more, most important was, at that time, Mooney was a famous worldwide character. And one of the things that happened is
                     when the supreme court granted the writ of <i>coram nobis,</i> they ordered him brought to the county, out of San Quentin, to the county jail in San Francisco. In the county jail, he was
                     set up. He had virtually a suite in the county jail of a couple of connecting cells all of his own, a typewriter, and some
                     comfortable chairs. And he had visitors. He got visitors from all over the world, who came to see him. He was a fascinating
                     man. He had used all of his years and— See it was 1916 when he went to jail, and by this time it was 1934, '35—yeah. So he
                     had been in jail for seventeen, eighteen years. He had become widely read, and he met all sorts of famous people, and he had
                     written.

                  <p class="noindent">I used to visit him. One of the things I got, as a result of this, is I became a friend of his because he loved to talk. And
                     I used to visit him, I suppose, during this period, maybe eight or ten times, and got to know him. It was a very important
                     thing to me to get to know this famous, worldwide, militant working-class leader.

                  <p class="noindent">In your getting to know him and your conversations with him, did he feel that he was eventually going to prevail? Was he pessimistic,
                     optimistic? How would you characterize his attitude towards the whole thing?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, he was optimistic. As a matter of fact, everybody was optimistic. The record in the case is an absolutely unbelievable
                     record. I have seen lots of things in my career; I have never seen anything to compare with that. There was no question, it
                     was definitely proved, that the district attorney not only secured perjured evidence, but let me give you an example of the
                     kind of evidence they let in at the trial [January, 1917]. A woman testified at his trial that she had seen Tom Mooney place
                     the satchel which allegedly contained a bomb—you know, there was a bomb that exploded [on July 22, 1916]—at the place where
                     the explosion took place. The defense, during the trial through some— I don't remember how it happened, but they got a picture
                     of her on top of a roof, several blocks from that place, where there was a clock on the roof. In the picture, it showed her
                     and the clock, and the time was about two minutes before the bomb exploded, about two blocks from the scene of the explosion.
                     There is no way—she had said that she saw him put it down a few minutes before the explosion—no way she could have been there.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">On cross-examination when they asked her about it, she said, "Well, I saw it in my mind's eye. I visualized it. I know it
                     was him." And they allowed the evidence to stand. Well, this was during a time of great hysteria and antilabor feeling then.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By 1934, things were moving in a different direction. Not only was Mooney optimistic, but he was optimistic with very good
                     reason. It wasn't a false optimism. Everybody thought that the supreme court would let him out. The very fact that they issued
                     a very unusual thing, the writ of <i>coram nobis,</i> and the world pressures were enormous. All over the world, people were calling for his

                     It was such a bad case, so he was optimistic, with good cause. The fact is the supreme court never acted on his case, because
                     [Culbert L.] Olson ran. One of the planks of his platform was that he would pardon Tom Mooney. And the thing that Olson did,
                     as he made his inaugural speech— He was sworn in [as governor in 1938], made his inaugural speech, stepped to one side, and
                     signed the pardon for Tom Mooney: right then and there. And so all of the work that I had done was never directly useful to
                     anybody.

                     about that campaign I'm always given to understand that things were much more organized in Southern California than in Northern
                     California. What was happening in San Francisco around that campaign?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I don't know that I'm too good a judge of it. I didn't play an important part in the campaign. I did such things as
                     help get out mailings, and I think I did some house-to-house stuff. In the Olson campaign, I was chairman of the speaker's
                     bureau for Northern California, but that was later. The Olson campaign had a very well organized and good campaign.

                  <p class="noindent">The Sinclair campaign—there was much more emotion around the Sinclair campaign. It was a terrific campaign from the standpoint
                     of moving people and

                     There was tremendous interest; more, I think, than in the Olson campaign. But Olson was better organized.

                     to know him, I don't remember. But anyway, he asked me to act as the Northern California chairman. Mainly it was San Francisco,
                     Oakland, Alameda, and some in Marin County. (Marin County wasn't as big of a development at that time.) I helped get speakers
                     out, and I went out and spoke myself. I did that for about two months. It seems to me that the campaigns weren't quite as
                     long then. Why, I don't know. I may be wrong on that, but it just seems to me they were shorter. They started later.

                     you couldn't get close to. He was an intellectual, no question about that. I was used to working with people, like in the

                  <p class="noindent">Which we'll talk about. By the way, on the Olson campaign, do you recall— Sinclair had come under such vicious attack by the
                     newspapers, by the motion picture industry, by the farmers—everybody, that is, everybody who saw him as a threat. When Olson
                     ran against [Frank F.] Merriam, do you recall if Olson attempted to distance himself from what you might call the legacy of
                     Sinclair? Or was the legacy of Sinclair something that was held up proudly by the campaign? What was the attitude?

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, he did not run on the same platform. Upton Sinclair was— He didn't call it a socialist program. It was really a socialist
                     platform. As a matter of fact, I thought much better run than saying I'm a socialist, although he never denied that he was
                     a socialist.

                  <p class="noindent">Olson was not nearly as radical as Sinclair was. I don't know that he disavowed Sinclair, but he certainly made it clear.
                     He had a liberal platform, which includes, as I say, freeing Tom Mooney, which wasn't all that advanced at that time. If somebody
                     had done that in '27, that'd mean a different story.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. Red-baiting wasn't so much— Though there was tremendous red-baiting of Sinclair himself, but that was mainly around the
                     slogans. I don't remember. You know, my memory isn't that— Even though I was involved in the way I indicated in the Olson,
                     most of my time was being spent at that time in the practice. I was already heavily into labor law practice at that time.
                     And my recollection is that it wasn't a big thing.

                  <p class="noindent">The Sinclair thing was a <i>battle,</i> you know, a running battle of— An ideological battle from the beginning to the end. I don't think Olson's was quite that.
                     Merriam was a very conservative man with very conservative positions. Didn't have the same qualities, as I remember. There
                     wasn't the same bitterness. The studios said, "We'll move out of California." For Sinclair, not for Olson. An insurance company
                     said, "We'll move out." None of that as I re— Nothing like that happened during the Olson campaign. It was different.

                     Johnson, Senator Johnson. Big tall man, six three or four and broad shouldered, an imposing figure. Junior was junior in every
                     respect: Size, he was about five eight or nine. He was a small man in <i>every</i> respect.

                  <p class="noindent">But as a result of his father's political connections, he had two main clients, out of which he made an income, I think, of
                     $50,000 a year, which was, believe me, that was an awful lot of money in those days, $50,000 dollars a year. He represented
                     the Bay Bridge authority [California Toll Bridge Authority, as it was called in the late 1930s], for which he got $25,000
                     a year. And he did the lobbying for the tobacco interest in the state legislature, for which he got $25,000 a year, even though
                     the legislature met every other year at that time. It was much later that the legislature started to meet every year.

                  <p class="noindent">I really began to do a little bit better—from making a living out of the practice of law—when I went to him. Because if he
                     had a $150 divorce case, a $200 divorce case, which was a lot of money as far as I was concerned, he wouldn't think of handling
                     it, and so he'd just turn it over to me. Where I've been handling $50 divorce cases, I got one occasionally for $150 and some
                     other work which paid much better, because clients that he wouldn't take because they didn't pay enough were big money to
                     me.

                     labor-management problems, but they had labor problems, like workers compensation things. They had tax questions, because
                     they were not the state itself. There were questions of— There were all kinds of questions. There were legitimate questions,
                     and, you know, that's big business—that Bay Bridge. That ought to have cost several million dollars. I don't remember how

                     it wasn't the purpose—but the biggest side benefit I got out of getting involved in the <i>Mooney</i> case was I began to meet the labor people, because the labor movement was strongly in support of Mooney. I met Bridges and
                     a number of other people. And then I met—there were two young laywers— Richard Gladstein, who was admitted the year before
                     I was admitted, and Aubrey [W.] Grossman, who was admitted the same year I was admitted, who had a firm called Gladstein and
                     Grossman at that time. Sometime in 1936 while

                     </div>I was in Johnson's office— He was in the Mills Building [220 Montgomery Street] and they were in the Mills Tower. It's really
                     the same building; one of them is called the tower. (I think part of it was built after the other.) So I became quite friendly
                     with them.

                  <p class="noindent">They represented the ILWU [International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union], the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, a
                     number of the militant trade unions of that time. And they were getting some personal injury work. I had won this first case
                     of mine, which was a very difficult case, and so I started trying some of their personal injury cases for them. But that isn't
                     really what I wanted. What I wanted was to get into the labor work, and gradually I started doing it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then in the spring of 1937, I left Johnson's office and moved over, and the firm became Gladstein, Grossman, Margolis. We
                     often kidded about why they took me into the firm. I had established credit with a bank, where I could borrow up to, I think,
                     a couple of hundred dollars. I had borrowed money to buy a car, and I paid them back. Once you've done that, you've got credit.
                     And we needed credit. They needed credit. [laughter] We were drawing twenty-five dollars a week at that time, which wasn't
                     all that bad, but there were weeks when the twenty-five dollars wasn't available. So I came into the firm and I was able to
                     borrow money for the firm. Within a short period of time, I was spending all of my time doing labor work, which is what I
                     had always wanted to do. I was really very fortunate to be able to get into it at that time, particularly to get into it with
                     that kind of a practice. We represented the ILWU, and it was— The relationship between attorneys and the unions they represented
                     was very different, then, than it is now. For example, we used to attend the conventions and participate in the conventions,
                     draft resolutions, do all kinds of things. And for all the first— Up until the time I left San Francisco in '43, there were

                     honorary members. But we had a very close, day-to-day working relationship. Also then, of course, the Bridges deportation
                     case, in which I did not play a principal role. The principal role was played by Richard Gladstein and Aubrey Grossman, but
                     I did participate in conferences, and I did examine some witnesses. Particularly, I remember I handled a handwriting expert

                     of things. One, I get the impression that there were not very many labor attorneys then. Of course, I suppose, maybe there
                     aren't very many now, but at that time, at any rate, this was something very new. You've discussed some of your own motivations.

                     lawyer: a brillant courtroom lawyer, one of the best I've ever seen in all my practice and recognized as that generally throughout
                     the bar. An intellectual who, you know, could quote the Bible and the classics and could use them in his courtroom presentations—a

                     together. Because all of us were very much involved in what we were doing and felt very deeply about what we were doing, so
                     we were very intense in our discussions.

                     had an injunction hearing in the 1937 strike, I think it was '37, maybe— Anyway, an injunction was issued against the longshoremen,
                     which they ignored. And there was a hearing. An order— There had been a temporary restraining order. It was a hearing on a
                     preliminary injunction directed against the union and all of them.

                  <p class="noindent">There were at that time about thirty-five hundred longshoremen, four thousand maybe, a lot of longshoremen and others related
                     to the union. Maybe five thousand working on the waterfront all together.

                     that he had. Also, in legal points too, he'd have some of the ideas. Some of which were— What do I say? Didn't make much sense,
                     although brilliant. So that's how the two of them worked.

                     I left. By the time I left, it had become Gladstein, Grossman, Margolis, Sawyer, and Edises. Our firm grew quite— We had,
                     oh, ten or eleven lawyers by the time I left. We had built up quite a practice.

                     weren't many. There wasn't much labor law. All of the labor legislation was in the process of being passed, and all was new.
                     It was just as new to lawyers who had been practicing for twenty, thirty, forty years as it was to us. And so we went in on
                     almost equal footing. The lawyers we were against—representing the big corporations—were all anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five
                     or thirty years older than us and with a background of practice. But we were able at least, partially because of the newness
                     of the subject, to hold our own with them, and actually do better than hold our own with them. We got in on the ground floor
                     of an absolutely new field of law.

                  <b>Balter</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Ben, we had begun to talk about the state of labor law when you first got into it. I know that the Wagner Act, so-called the
                     National Labor Relations Act, had just been passed in July of 1935, just at the time when you were getting involved in labor
                     law. Finally, its constitutionality was upheld by the [United States] Supreme Court in [March] 1937, I believe. As a labor
                     attorney working with other labor attorneys, what do you recall as the immediate impact of the passage of that act on how
                     you viewed labor law, the field, in general?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, you really have to go back to the period prior to the enactment of the law in order to understand the impact of the
                     law, because it's the change that this brought about that is most significant. Up until that point, labor lawyers, or labor
                     itself, viewed virtually every aspect of the law as being antilabor: Injunctions against picketing were issued at the drop
                     of a hat. There were criminal prosecutions. Every time there was a strike, there were dozens of criminal prosecutions for
                     almost anything that happened, including rigged traffic cases—all kinds of things. The law operated as the enemy of labor.
                     Now, there might have been an occasional acceptance, but that was the picture.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And here along comes an agency, which, by god, is on the side of labor! And it really is on the side of labor. First of all,
                     the [new] law, as it was originally enacted, was designed to protect the rights of labor to organize and bargain collectively.
                     It gave nothing to the employer. It was intended to correct the terrible imbalance that existed between the rights of the
                     few and the many.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Second, the [new National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)] was staffed. The labor board was staffed with prolabor people, so
                     that you had people
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>working for the board who were trying to help labor to organize and to bargain collectively, which was trying to carry out
                     the purposes of the act. It wasn't that they were doing something that the law didn't intend; they were doing what the law
                     intended they should do.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">For the first time, for example, if you had unfair labor practice charges against an employer, you worked hand in glove with
                     a government official. Who ever heard of such a thing, working hand in glove with them? You were both on the same side of
                     the table—of the conflict. This affected the whole aspect of the ability to organize, of the ability of the labor movement
                     to move ahead.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There isn't any doubt in my mind, first, that even without that law, there would have been a great organizing drive, and there
                     would have been considerable success. But equally, there's no doubt in my mind that it would not have had the extent of the
                     success that it had as a result of this act being passed.

                     were still in session every other year, unless there was a special session called. And I think I was there for two sessions.
                     I don't remember the years. That's another aspect, but if we got the Warren years of governorship, it would be at that time.

                     principal client was the ILWU [International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union], led by Harry Bridges, who was of course
                     a leader in the entire labor movement. At that time, they were still in the AFL. The longshoremen out here were part of the
                     International Longshoremen's Association [ILA]. When I began to get involved, the beginning of a break away from the ILA was
                     in the air. And Harry Bridges of course— [telephone rings] Not supposed to call me. [tape recorder off] Harry Bridges was
                     working closely with John L. Lewis by that time. But I don't recall just what the organizational structure, so far as the
                     CIO was concerned, it certainly wasn't more than a committee within the AF of L at that time.

                     of workers in basic industries. Is that also your recollection of what some of the key differences were that were emerging?
                     Were there other issues also?

                  <p class="noindent">The basic trade union issue was the one you have mentioned: the question of industrial versus craft organization, with the
                     craft unions taking the position that the industrial unions were invading their jurisdiction, even though they were organizing
                     workers that had never been organized before. But that was simply one manifestation of an entirely different political approach.

                     And John was an attorney for the board. You found yourselves on the same side apparently. Do you remember any of those early

                     into the warehouse union, a group of workers employed by the Cowell Portland Cement Company in Cowell [Contra Costa County],
                     California. They had been organized. They had engaged in a strike and then had been locked out, and I think about a hundred
                     or more [172] employees—all men—had been fired.

                  <p class="noindent">We filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging that the company had refused to bargain in good faith, recognize the union

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, also in that case, the company had formed a company union, and we alleged that that was an unfair labor practice. The
                     first hearing on that, I think, was in '38, about '38, something like that. Things were still relatively new as far as the
                     board was concerned, and I represented the union. We tried the case in Cowell, California, which is a very small community
                     consisting largely of the Cowell Portland Cement Company, about twenty, twenty-five miles outside of Oakland. The company
                     union had affiliated with the AF of L. There was an attorney by the name of [Charles J.] Janigin, I remember him, who represented
                     the company union. And there were several attorneys who represented the Cowell Portland Cement Company. The firm was the firm
                     of [Max] Thelan and [Gordon] Johnson. (Johnson later became, I forget whether it was an assemblyman or a state senator, one
                     or the other, or it was his brother who became that. They were a very influential family in politics.)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We tried the first case for six or seven weeks in Cowell. The board eventually issued an order giving us all of the relief
                     we had asked for; however, the board had failed to serve the company union. It had taken the position that the company union
                     was not a genuine union and therefore was not entitled to be served. The case went up to the Supreme Court of the United States
                     and the Supreme Court reversed the case on the sole ground that the company union was entitled to its day in court and should
                     have been served.

                  <p class="noindent">Then about 1941, '42, John and I tried the case a second time. I think the second time, it took sixteen weeks, something like
                     that. Took about almost three times as long to try the case. And again we won the case. It went up again, was affirmed this
                     time, and the Supreme Court denied a hearing [April 23, 1945]. All of this from the date that the charge was filed, which
                     I believe was '37, some date [July 17, 1937] until the—

                     it had gone up and down twice, in addition to being argued before the board twice. We recovered in that case, my recollection
                     is, for the men something like $200,000, which again you've got to think in terms of <i>those</i> days. Today, $200,000 isn't very much; it was a lot of money in those days. It was one of the big recoveries as far as California
                     was concerned. That was one of the kind of cases that we were handling. Of course, there was a good deal of organizing going

                     used to try to prevent being organized?

                     the majority of the cases. They would openly and directly fire people for their union activities. They would. Or even if they
                     tried to cover up, the cover-up would be very, very thin. There was a period of total lawlessness on the part of 95 percent
                     of the employers. And that made the cases in those days relatively easy to try, because, later on, employers became more subtle
                     in their activities. They didn't try to be subtle in those days. They went out to terrorize the union, to put the fear of
                     their jobs in the minds of the men, and to break the union before it started. They openly refused to bargain. There was every
                     kind of flagrant violation. At the same time, we were getting relief from the board. The big problem was that it took so long.

                     where the militant labor movement was. That section of the labor movement was a section that was organizing. While there was
                     some organizing going on within the old AF of L unions, they were primarily raids [on other unions]. What the AF of L was
                     doing in those days, for the most part, the old AF of L, was rather than going out and doing initial organizing, [it] would
                     wait until a committee union or, later on, a congress union started to organize and then would come in and try to take over,

                     for— My, maybe, looking at it from a present-day point of view, it would seem as though it was unfortunate, although perhaps
                     necessary, but unfortunate that the craft unions and industrial unions would have to split since the conception was that there
                     shouldn't be such a split, but there should be a vertical organization. Yet the development of the CIO, to some extent, represents
                     a sort of culmination of a split. You know that's my view, looking at it, which— I wonder how people were looking at it back
                     then, and whether there was an attempt to try to avoid a split at that time.

                  <p class="noindent">There was an area of difference of opinion. At some point around '38, I don't— Dates as I say are difficult, but '38, '39,
                     somewhere in that period, it became evident that the AF of L was either going to bring the CIO unions into line or was going
                     to expel them. And there was a dispute that went on among the unions as to whether they should fight to stay within the AF
                     of L, even though they knew that ultimately they probably would be expelled, or should say to hell with you [and] withdraw.
                     There was that kind of conflict going on, as to which was the best course of action.

                  <p class="noindent">Looking at it with hindsight, it didn't make one hell of a lot of difference. As a practical matter, some of the unions did
                     withdraw before they were expelled. They would have been expelled if they hadn't. Others waited until they were expelled.

                  <p class="noindent">I might add one other thing. There were some legal aspects to some of it, as to rights to retain property and so forth, that
                     arose in some instances, but those were not really the principal considerations.

                     a common interest in getting the same result. And it worked very well. The lawyers got along very well, despite the fact that

                     strike: When block after block of longshoremen, with their caps off, walked silently. Absolutely silently, down the street.
                     Not a policeman in sight, with <i>huge</i> crowds on both sides of the street. And total quiet. It was an unim— You can't imagine how quiet and this demonstration of

                     support of various kinds from the Communist Party—open, open support. Not only did the press support them, but money was raised
                     for him. Food was furnished. All kinds of things were done to help the longshoremen, and nobody at any time proposed that
                     that be denied.

                  <p class="noindent">The decision was made to assert it, to put it straight out front: "Yes, of course, I did. I get the help from wherever I can
                     get it, and they helped me. I'll take help again. They were loyal and honest and supported us. We want that kind of support
                     from everybody, and I will never turn down support from the Communist Party." That kind of thing. A defiant standup approach
                     on the thing, rather than perhaps saying, "Well, maybe I made a mistake" or "After all, I was in so much trouble that I had
                     to take help." It was an <i>assertive</i> position with respect.

                     that he wasn't fairly close to the Communist Party and that he didn't support the great many of their views. But organizationally,
                     I think it is correct. I <i>know</i> it's correct: he's not a member.

                  <p class="noindent">I think it is correct that he did not meet the definition of affiliated, because that has an organizational connotation that
                     to some extent you are bound to do what they do, so forth. Well, Harry Bridges was never bound to do what anybody told him
                     to do. He was very sympathetic and supportive, perhaps [of] most of their views, but he supported them as an individual. And
                     he would take those views entirely apart from the Communist Party.

                     tell them to do. But I was not afraid to go to the communists and ask them what they thought. And I did so." I'm not saying
                     he used those exact words, but this was the approach that he took in his defense.

                  <p class="noindent">None of us were immigration lawyers. Remember, this was a deportation case. Carol King was recognized at that time as one
                     of the foremost immigration lawyers in the country: She had practiced extensively in the field; she had handled many cases
                     on appeal; she knew the law thoroughly; and therefore, she was an expert. She was our expert in a field where, to some extent,
                     we became slightly expert, but she was <i>the</i> expert.

                  <p class="noindent">Carol was a very unusual person. She didn't care a thing about her appearance. We all got along very well with Carol, but
                     I remember that particularly Richie used to fight with her about her appearance and try to get her to look a little bit neater,
                     to look a little bit better for the press, to dress a little less— A little more carefully. I don't mean that she was dirty
                     or anything like that, but she didn't care about whether she mixed colors that were wrong or any, any— Or how her hair looked
                     or have her— And Richie felt that that was important, and I think I, to some extent, supported Richie in that. We felt that
                     she had a tendency to ignore her appearance too much.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">She was a kind of, to a certain extent, a loner. We went out to dinner occasionally, but she used to like to go back to her
                     hotel. Get fruit and read for the time that she was alone. We were very good friends, all of us. There was never— When I say
                     they fought, I don't mean that there was any bitterness—personal bitterness—but they simply disagreed. Her position was that
                     appearance didn't make a damn bit of difference and to

                     see Carol; she came out to California, she'd see us. You know, it was a very good relationship.

                  <p class="noindent">But she was primarily the lawyer: the one who knew the law and how to apply the law to the facts of our case and to help develop

                  <p class="noindent">One question. Harry Bridges has written that the hearing took place on Angel Island, because the government wanted to portray
                     him as being very dangerous or thought that he was dangerous or whatever. What is your impression or remembrance of why the
                     hearings were held on Angel Island? People tell stories of having to take the ferryboat back and forth every day.

                  <p class="noindent">It wasn't a ferryboat; they were kind of speed boats. And one of the things is they were limited— We were most opposed to
                     it for one reason: that there was limited access to the public. Supposed to be a public hearing— It was public, but there
                     was only an ability to carry a few people over, and that was our main beef about that; otherwise, we really didn't care very
                     much. It was very quiet and nice over there. You got over there and you had that one thing to do. It had certain advantages,
                     but our principal opposition was that we wanted to have more of the public have

                  <p class="noindent">You began to mention earlier the role that you did claim in the hearing, concerning the handwriting expert and the alleged
                     Communist Party membership card.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Yes. They had a membership card which was not in the name of Bridges. It was in another name, and I can't remember the name
                     ["Harry Dorgan"]. They put on a handwriting expert to testify that it was his handwriting.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I hadn't known anything about handwriting before then. Actually, the reason that this task was assigned to me was because
                     it was a kind of a specialized task that was different from whether somebody was telling the truth. It was a very technical
                     task. I read a couple of books on handwriting, and I consulted with a very good handwriting expert. I cross-examined this
                     handwriting expert. Whether as a result of that or other reasons, as I recall, [James M.] Landis [the trial examiner] found
                     that it was not his [Bridges's] card. See, if they'd found that this was his handwriting and his card, we would have had a
                     very difficult time. So it was a very short phase. I think it lasted one day if I remember right—maybe a day and a half. It
                     was an important part of the case.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, the case, as I understand what you're saying before, because the case went on for, well, almost three months, from July
                     to September of 1939— Do you recall when you were— I take it that most of the time you were kind of handling—watching the
                     store back at the office? Would that be correct? Or were you at each one—

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">That's one hundred percent correct. So far as I can remember, I was only over there for two or three days. I went over there
                     when the handwriting expert was due to be put on, and I was there until this

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, we left off last time talking about the Harry Bridges deportation case in which you had somewhat a limited [participation]
                     but somewhat of a role concerning the handwriting expert. I want to jump ahead in time a little bit, while we're talking about
                     Harry Bridges, to a case that I know you were involved in, actually two combined cases, as I understand it, <i>Bridges</i> v. <i>California</i> and <i>Times Mirror Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court of California,</i> concerning some free speech issues with Harry Bridges and the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> Certainly no friends of each other, but nevertheless, thrown together, [they] had been cited for contempt. Can you set the
                     scene for us a little bit on these cases and tell us about your own involvement?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, there was in the Los Angeles Harbor a rather unusual situation, so far as the ILWU [International Longshoremen's and
                     Warehousemen's Union] was concerned. For some reason, that I never really understood, the local had been incorporated. As
                     a result of that incorporation, the board of directors controlled the union as against the wishes of the rank and file on
                     many, many instances. The board of directors was an anti-Bridges group of pro-AF of L [American Federation of Labor], anti-CIO
                     [Congress of Industrial Organizations] group, who were known as the "Dirty Dozen." There were twelve of them and that was
                     the name by which they were known. When the ILWU affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, they said that
                     they were going, the Dirty Dozen said that they were going to keep a Los Angeles local in with the AFL—were not going to go
                     along.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What happened then was— Let me see if I can remember the sequence.

                     </div>When the Dirty Dozen announced what they were going to do, there was a picket line established, a rank-and-file picket line
                     established by the [local] longshoremen and longshoremen from various parts of the coast. There was an injunction proceeding
                     against that picket line on the ground that there were some technical grounds. I don't remember the details at the moment,
                     but the fact that there was a corporation was an element in the whole setup.
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">It was the board that sought an injunction?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">No— I think it was the board. Yes, the board sought an injunction, or it may have been the shipowners. The picket line, I
                     think, extended beyond the port and tied up the ships. I guess it was the boat owners, yeah, the boat owners sought an injunction,
                     or the stevedoring company sought an injunction, on the grounds that this was an internal labor dispute and should not be
                     allowed to shut down the port.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There were I and the attorney Al [Abraham Lincoln] Wirin, who was— This was in 1939. I was still in the San Francisco office.
                     Al Wirin was a member of a firm—Johnson, Gallagher, and Wirin, I believe it was [Gallagher, Wirin, and Johnson]—that represented
                     the progressive unions in the Los Angeles area, including the ILWU Local 13. So I was sent by the international to participate
                     in this litigation, and Al Wirin was acting on behalf of the local people.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I prepared an affidavit for Harry Bridges to sign. In that affidavit, Harry Bridges said that if an injunction was issued
                     and men were required to work here, the whole coast would be shut down. Contempt proceedings were filed against Bridges. Oh,
                     Charles [J.] Katz was another attorney who was involved in this, although he didn't handle the hearings. All he did was to
                     file— See, I was in San Francisco. I prepared the affidavit with Bridges. Sent it to Charles; Charles filed it. Contempt proceedings
                     were started against Harry Bridges for having made the affidavit and against Charles Katz for having filed the affidavit.
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>The theory being that this was a threat directed against the court, an attempt to influence the court by a threat of this
                     kind of economic action. When these contempt proceedings were started, Charles, Charlie hired outside counsel. The outside
                     counsel pleaded something like <i>nolo contendere</i> and he was fined $500.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We pleaded not guilty on this charge. We had many defenses, but the one that is the most interesting is the following: The
                     <i>Los Angeles Times</i> was writing editorials which were criticizing the courts for not being harder on the longshoremen, for not enforcing this.
                     We filed an affidavit claiming denial of equal protection of the laws on the grounds [that] they're proceeding against the
                     union, or against Bridges, for contempt, for allegedly threatening the court; and the <i>Times</i> was doing something very similar and that they were home free. As a result of this, the judge requested the bar association,
                     I think it was the Los Angeles Bar Association, to file contempt proceedings against the <i>Times</i> on behalf of the superior court and that was done.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So here you have, suddenly, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and Harry Bridges on the same side as far as the issue of law was concerned [but] around an issue on which they were on opposite
                     sides of the fence as to what should happen. Al Wirin was retained by the— I guess not. Al Wirin— I'm just trying to remember.
                     Al Wirin, yes, was retained by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> to represent them in this case. Both Bridges and the <i>Times</i> were found in contempt of court for allegedly threatening the trial court.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Our defense was that we weren't making any threat. It was just that the union had a policy that they all worked together or
                     <i>none</i> of them worked. That they were simply advising the court of the fact that this was their policy. It was no threat at all.
                     But somehow, the trial judge saw it as a threat. It went up on appeal. Finally decided by the [United States] Supreme Court,
                     which was faced
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">88</span> ―
                     </div>with an interesting situation. The Supreme Court pretty much was in the situation where either it had to hold both the newspaper
                     and Bridges in contempt, or neither of them in contempt. It would have been not impossible, but very difficult for the Supreme
                     Court to distinguish the two cases without appearing to discriminate against Bridges and in favor of the <i>Times.</i> So they finally handed down a decision in which they set aside the contempt proceedings against both and said they were legitimate
                     exercise of free speech.

                  <p class="noindent">Somewhere in here, I'm not sure exactly how this fits in, there was the issue of a telegram to Secretary of Labor Frances
                     Perkins that Harry Bridges sent. How did that fit into this picture?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Some of this comes back to me a little more clearly now. The way that it was alleged in the— We sent a telegram—we, that is,
                     the ILWU. I was, as I say, in the middle of this; I was acting as the lawyer in this situation. We sent a telegram to Perkins
                     saying that this situation—and explaining the whole situation—could lead to a shutdown of the entire port. Asking <i>her</i> to intervene, to see to it that this disaster of the shipping didn't occur. Instead of saying directly in the affidavits
                     what was going to happen, we merely attached the telegram to the affidavits. Said we sent this telegram—and attached the telegram
                     to it—and we were also claiming the right to petition the government on this and inform the court of the fact that we had
                     petitioned the government to intervene in what was a serious situation. This helped us to eventually get the favorable decision
                     that we did.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, yeah. We said we had sent that telegram. And I'm pretty sure that we said in the affidavit—I'm positive—that this was
                     a truthful statement that we had made to her. That was the basis for the contempt. Of course, the

                  <p class="noindent">As I understand it from my research, the judge's name was Judge Ruben [S.] Schmidt; does that correspond with your memory?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">That's right. One of the most conservative judges on the superior court here, who really gave us a very, very bad time in
                     the course of it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It was in the course of this case that something else very interesting happened. Prior to the time that the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> was brought in, we moved to disqualify Judge Schmidt. We filed an affidavit of bias and prejudice on the ground that he had
                     proceeded against Bridges and had not proceeded against the <i>Times.</i> He refused. Ordinarily, the practice was to turn the hearing on such a challenge over to another judge. He refused to do
                     so and heard the matter of his qualifications himself.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It was a real circus. We said we wanted to ask him some questions.</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "You can't ask me any questions, but if you want to state what your questions are, I may answer them or I may not."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And so we would ask a question. The other side would object, the counsel representing the judge would object. Then we would
                     make a motion that the judge call in another judge to rule on the objection, because he couldn't rule on an objection to a
                     question put to him. He would overrule that objection and then go ahead and answer the question. He would sustain the objection
                     of the question, and then go ahead and answer it. [laughter] Anyway, it was one of those real circuses.

                     of communists. Apparently, Cosgrove was first very reluctant to allow that citation to be used as an attorney for the <i>Times.</i> It was of course notoriously anti-red at that time. Does that incident ring a bell with you?

                     the cases. I don't think that question was raised. So what I know about it is primarily what Al Wirin told me when— We had
                     cited that case in our brief, and he [Wirin] wanted to cite it in their brief. He told me about the discussion that he had
                     with Cosgrove, and my recollection is that Cosgrove gave in and finally permitted the case to be cited.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, there were similar cases. I remember one case, Pfeiffer—it's odd, it sticks in my mind—<i>Pfeiffer</i> v. <i>Borun Brothers.</i> Borun I think became Thrifty Drug [Stores Company] later on, series of drug— And that involved not the longshore local, but
                     the warehouse local, ILWU [Local] 26. There had been the change of affiliation of the ILWU, and Borun Brothers brought an
                     action to— One of two things happened, either Borun Brothers canceled the contract and we brought an action to enforce it,
                     or Borun Brothers brought an action to cancel.

                  <p class="noindent">I don't remember the precise form that the litigation took, but the issue was whether or not the ILWU could change its affiliation
                     from AF of L to the CIO and the locals take with them the contracts that they had had while they were part of the AF of L.
                     We prevailed in that litigation, and there were— I happen to remember that one because that was a very important case, because
                     it involved a large unit, quite a number of drugstores, but there were other cases of that kind. There was another—there were
                     furniture workers—similar case. There were a number of such cases. Then there were a couple of strikes I was involved in.

                     issue of the internment of the Japanese after Pearl Harbor and the role that— Many were involved: yourself, Al Wirin, Leo
                     Gallagher, the CIO, the Communist Party (which you had begun to represent at that time as I understand). I know that Al Wirin
                     eventually split with the Gallagher law firm because of his feeling that the internment should be fought. What do you recall

                     sharp breaks between the Left and the Right, they [sat] shoulder to shoulder. And around many of the issues relating to the
                     conduct of the war that was so. The Communist Party at that time took the position that everything else had to yield to whatever
                     was necessary in order to win the war. And that was the trade union position, both the AF of L and the CIO. It was, I suppose,
                     the position of 95 percent of the people in organizations in this country, and I don't think I am exaggerating.

                     that occurs to me, at the moment, of which I am deeply ashamed. But I did wholeheartedly support the position of the CIO and—

                     He left the firm, not because of his differences with other members of the firm—although other members of the firm supported
                     the internment of the Japanese—but because the CIO took the

                     or a very large portion of his time with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], which I think was the only organization
                     in the country, or the only organization of consequence, that opposed the internment.

                     winning the war was so important that you simply didn't take even the slightest chance of sabotage or anything like that.
                     Of course, there was <i>no</i> evidence—<i>nothing</i> to support the concept that there was any more danger from the Japanese than from anyone else. But there was virtually— I
                     can't remember any discussion, except with Al Wirin, who argued very strenuously, very strongly for his position.

                  <p class="noindent">The Gus Brown case, yes. That was a case— Al did not go to work immediately full-time for the ACLU. They couldn't—they weren't
                     big enough at that time. But he established the law firm which became Wirin, Okrand, and Rissman, I believe. This case was
                     handled for Wirin's office by [Robert] Rissman, not by Wirin himself. As a matter of fact, that's one of the— what I said
                     was—inexcusable excuses that Wirin had for this.
                  </p>

                     stayed with the AF of L after a bitter fight as to whether it should go CIO or stay with the AF of L. A majority decided to
                     stay with the AF of L, but the Los Angeles local, headed by a man then by the name of Gus Brown, decided that it would withdraw
                     and go into the CIO, which in fact it did. There was litigation over who had the right to the

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The bitterness developed over the fact that in the course of their briefs and arguments to the courts handled by Rissman,
                     there was vicious red-baiting. I had a big fight with Wirin at that time, saying, "You know you're a principled guy. You know
                     that that's no basis— I say you have a right to represent these people—argue what the Constitution means, who has a right
                     to the property, and so forth—but you know how unprincipled this is."

                  <p class="noindent">As I remember Wirin was weak-kneed about it. Said, "Well, Rissman is handling the case, and I can't control him."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Never did anything to stop him. And I always knew that Wirin really controlled that firm. He was the strong person in that
                     firm, and if he had wanted to stop it, he could have. That was the first big fight I had with Al. Our differences from that
                     point on, in one way or another, were around that issue, although there were some other questions that might come up later
                     in the Smith Act case [<i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>].

                  <p class="noindent">But Al had a habit of— You know he represented communists many times. Represented the Communist Party, came in <i>amicus</i> [<i>curiae</i>], and did some pretty good work in those areas. But he would stand up before the court and say— Yes, start out by saying,
                     "I want the court to know I am not a communist. And I absolutely disagree with them, but the worst people are entitled to
                     the protection of the Constitution." And he would repeat that and do that all of the time.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. Ben, I know that you were one of the founders of the National Lawyers Guild. I believe in 1937 your organization first
                     got started. What do you recall about the founding of that organization? Who was involved? Why was it founded?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, let me say that I was one of the founders of the organization in one sense: I was in contact with a number of people
                     in the East. The guild was primarily— The primary organizational efforts were in New York City— maybe to some extent Washington,
                     D.C.—by a group working there. We got calls from some of the people and gave support to that, but didn't actually participate
                     in the meetings there, except that we agreed to immediately set up, as part of the organization, a San Francisco—that was
                     when I was in San Francisco in '37—a San Francisco chapter of the guild.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">If you want to know how the guild came into existence, well, a lot of people say—and there is some truth but not complete
                     accuracy in the statement—that the guild was organized around the [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt court-packing issue. You may
                     remember that.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The Supreme Court of the United States had been declaring unconstitutional measure after measure that had been initiated under
                     Roosevelt as part of the New Deal. What they were doing was saying that property rights were being violated. For example,
                     there was a children and women's labor law that they declared unconstitutional. They said this interfered with the right of
                     the women to contract their labor; in other words, outlawed them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There were many, many that they held unconstitutional which we considered
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>as an extension, in modern times, of the Dred Scott decision, which placed the rights of slave property over the human rights
                     of the slaves. Here they are placing the rights of big corporations, big business, over the human rights of the workers. The
                     New Deal was simply being prevented from coming into effect, as a result of what the Supreme Court single-handedly was doing.
                     Roosevelt—I don't remember whether it was by a speech, or just how it happened—indicated one way or another that he wanted
                     to increase the size of the Supreme Court so he would have enough appointments to turn the minority of the Supreme Court into
                     a majority, which would have prevented this.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The guild was formed around this issue of the Supreme Court preventing any progress. In the course of it, it is true that
                     many of the lawyers in the guild supported the court-packing idea, but the concept back of it was really a much broader concept:
                     the concept of property rights versus human rights. As a matter of fact, in the first constitution of the guild, that's the
                     major phrase of the constitutionally stated objectives of the guild, to give preference to human rights over property rights,
                     and that was the area in which it was formed. It was originally quite a broad organization.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It is true that there are many— Virtually all of the Left lawyers belonged to it. Lawyers who had any relationship to the
                     Communist Party and other Left organizations belonged to it. But there were also liberals, New Dealers, New Deal lawyers.
                     Many, many government lawyers, because the government was filled with lawyers who philosophically supported the New Deal,
                     either from a Left standpoint or a liberal standpoint. All of the CIO labor attorneys, without exception, representing the
                     internationals belonged, participated in forming the guild, or joined it in the very early stages. Some AF of L lawyers. Goldberg,
                     for example, was an AF of L lawyer. I don't remember, I think he came a little later, but he was at one point— Arthur [J.]

                  <p class="noindent">They got involved in all kinds of legal matters relating to the New Deal: writing <i>amicus</i> briefs, supporting the constitutionality of legislation, testifying before Congress on legislation, proposing legislation—wherever
                     there were legal problems.

                  <p class="noindent">It was basically an organization which at <i>that</i> time supported various progressive matters of the New Deal. It participated in trying to make legislation stronger [in] the
                     interest of the people, like the social security law. For example, it carried on a fight as a— One specific fight, I remember,
                     was to have the social security payments supported by the general funds, rather than setting up what amounted to insurance

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I would say that the Communist Party had some influence on the program of the guild by virtue of the fact that there
                     were many lawyers who were members of the Communist Party—or if not members, were friendly to the Communist Party—and who
                     accepted its basic concepts and carried those concepts into the guild, along with others.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">However, in those days, the early days at least, you have to recognize the fact that the program of the Communist Party was
                     practically the Roosevelt program. So you could just as correctly state that the lawyers were promoting the New Deal program.
                     Maybe it's more accurate to say that. Whether they were influenced into doing that, to some extent, by the Communist Party
                     is another question. Probably so.

                  <p class="noindent">You really have to go back to look at the particular history of the guild. Throughout the war, this unity of various forces,
                     of the type I've talked about, persisted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Oh, by the way, the guild also— I forgot to mention one thing. The guild from its very inception was very interested in racial
                     matters, in ending racial discrimination. It became the first national bar association not to draw the color line, to invite
                     all people into it. The American Bar Association [ABA] at that time had a rule that only white lawyers could belong.

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah. Well, whether it was written or not, it had no black members and it was an actual policy. I think it was in writing,
                     but I'm not positive. But there's just no doubt, and the American Bar Association doesn't dispute it, that that was so. So
                     that was an issue around which the guild fought in addition to the New Deal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You see the New Deal itself was not that much concerned with discrimination. The New Deal was 95 percent around economic matters
                     or matters related to economics, like the National Labor Relations Act, which after all is an economic measure ultimately.
                     So that there the guild went substantially beyond the New Deal. But there was agreement among its members on that, there wasn't
                     a split in that area.

                     ended up in the supreme court of the state. It was handled primarily by John [T.] McTernan. I did some work on it, but he
                     handled most of it, called <i>In re Laws.</i> The man's name was Henry Laws. That [case] involved a black family which owned a house in an area where there was a restrictive
                     covenant. This was an action to evict them from the house that they owned on the ground that the restrictive covenant gave
                     them no right to live there, even though they owned the house. That was finally won in the Supreme Court of California. I

                  <p class="noindent">There was just a <i>lot</i> of movement around that. I remember one incident with Loren that might be of interest. It might show how little sometimes
                     we whites understand the feelings of black people. There had been a study done in UCLA—and there was a big article about it—on
                     the question of the determination of how much, if any "Negro blood" there was in a person as distinguished from, say, "white
                     blood." The article said you really can't tell; there is really no way of knowing the color of— You can have a person, as
                     I remember the article, who has 10 percent Negro blood and still be black; and you can have a person with 90 percent Negro
                     blood and be white. That there's just no way of telling: the blood is the same. So when you use the term Negro blood, at least
                     as it was understood at that time— I think by this time there had been some ultimate differences found.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I remember going to Loren and saying, "Why don't we attack restrictive covenants on the ground that there is no legal way
                     of telling whether a person is or is not black, and therefore there is no way of enforcing it?" I thought that was a good,
                     progressive position to take.

                  <p class="noindent">He, I remember, he was angry. He said, "We're fighting for the right of black people to be black. Not on the right that you
                     can't tell who's black and who's white. Don't tell millions of black people here that you can't tell who's black and who's
                     white. They know." I [laughs] backed away very, very quickly. I'm not particularly ashamed of that, but I, that I— You know,
                     sounded like a good idea. My motives were very good, but it shows a lack of understanding of how black people felt about the
                     fight. I was trying to find a technical way of winning the fight, which they wanted to fight—correctly—on a principled basis
                     of the right of black people—

                  <p class="noindent">Well, Loren was one of the best lawyers with whom I have ever come in contact. His ability was very, very great. Loren Miller
                     was a liberal. He was not—Loren Miller was not a socialist. As a matter of fact, I think he believed in the capitalist system,
                     but he was concerned primarily about what had happened to his people.

                     for many years, could not get an appointment as a judge. Loren should have been on the supreme court of the state. He had
                     that kind of capacity, and he had the desire. He wanted very much to be a judge, and he was a very studious kind of a guy—the
                     kind of a guy that ought to be on an appellate bench.

                     and wanted very much to get appointed a judge, I don't think he ever red-baited. You know, I don't think he became unprincipled
                     in what he did. I respected him a great deal.

                     attention to events as the signals of red-baiting generally— When [Harry S.] Truman— Shortly after the war, as I was saying,
                     an act had been adopted or promulgated—his loyalty oath and loyalty tests for government employees [Loyalty Order promulgated
                     by President Truman on March 22, 1947]. There was some attrition, but not a

                     in membership of the guild occured at a Chicago convention of the guild. I remember it was in winter. I remember going out
                     after one session to get some coffee at a restaurant nearby and how cold it was.

                  <p class="noindent">I think it was probably '47. Could have been '46, could have been '48, but I'm almost sure it was '47. The issue was the Marshall
                     Plan [June, 1947]. There was a resolution to oppose the Marshall Plan, primarily on the basis that it excluded the Soviet
                     Union and that it was really designed as an instrument to be used against—to rebuild Western Europe as a bulwark against—the
                     Soviet Union. Remember this was a couple of years after the "iron curtain" speech [by Winston Churchill at Fulton, Missouri,
                     1946], and red-baiting was already in full progress by then.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was a bitter, bitter, bitter contest. At that time, maybe a third or so of the members of the guild were government
                     employees—federal government employees. The resolution to oppose the Marshall Plan passed by a decisive vote, but with a very
                     substantial opposition: maybe 60-40, or something like that. The next day, virtually, I think, every government employee resigned
                     and a great many others resigned. I think virtually overnight the guild lost maybe close to half of its membership. That was
                     the one single event where there was overnight a huge drop in membership. From that time on, there was a period of attrition.
                     People kept dropping off—no question about it—and very few people were joining, so that the guild kept dropping in size until
                     it was left finally with a very small number.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, certainly it is true that the communists in the organization constituted a much larger percentage of the organization,
                     simply because they did not drop out. The ones that did drop out were anticommunist first and then many of the noncommunists.
                     There were some then who dropped out because of fear, but basically I think there was disagreement at first. But from that
                     time on, I think that the people dropped out largely because of fear, rather than— although I'm sure that there were disagreements
                     also. So that the organization was left more and more with hard-core, if you want to use that word, people who believed in
                     either the communist principles or who were firmly Left and willing to take the risks. And there were very real risks that
                     belonging to the guild meant.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, the debate around the Marshall Plan brings to mind a question. Were there debates in the guild about just what type of
                     organization the guild was supposed to be? In other words, how broad of an organization it would be? That it would take positions
                     on foreign affairs or not? Were these things just automatically part of the guild, or were there debates around what the guild
                     should be doing?

                  <p class="noindent">At a later time that was a very important issue in the guild—in the seventies. But I'm sure when the Marshall Plan was argued,
                     as far as I can remember, that was the first time when somebody suggested, "Let's not take a position on the Marshall Plan.
                     Let's keep out of foreign affairs; let's devote ourselves only to domestic matters." That was not really an opinion that was

                     appointed representatives of two bar associations, the ABA [American Bar Association] and the guild, in equal numbers. The
                     guild played a <i>far</i> bigger part in the formation of the United Nations than the ABA did. The ABA basically did not support the formation of the

                     was going out with Val's—my future wife's—sister, Helen. I remember we went up to their apartment to pick up Helen, who's
                     my friend's date for the night. I then met Val and decided that I wanted to see her again. Had access because my friend knew
                     Helen's number, so I called and we started going around together.

                     who was quite religious. And I married a shiksa. They did not—my father, by the way, did not feel this way about it, just
                     my stepmother—but they did not attend the wedding. As a matter of fact, Val's mother and father and Val's sister went with
                     us to this little place where we were married. And then we went on for our honeymoon. But my stepmother—who came to consider
                     me and my brother as though we were her own children and who, from a standpoint of giving of herself, treated us as though
                     we were her children—became so ill that she had to be hospitalized as a result of my marrying a shiksa. Although, to her credit,
                     later on she overcame this. She and Val became very good friends.

                     to live on and within less than a year, I had formed my alliance with the Gladstein, Grossman office and things began to look
                     up financially.

                  <b>Balter</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Ben, you've made available to me several hundred pages of materials that you've received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
                     [FBI]: documents which were prepared over several decades when you were under investigation by the bureau. Well, I certainly
                     would assume that you would not consider this to be a source of accurate information. Nevertheless, there is material in there,
                     which prompts some questions that I would like to ask you to comment on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">First of all, perhaps on a light note, but it does raise a question. In a FBI report, dated August 1943, we read that subject
                     Margolis, quote, "once lost ninety dollars in a big poker game following a session at the Tom Mooney Labor School." [laughs]
                     Now that brings two questions to mind. First of all, of course, did you really lose that ninety dollars? And second of all,
                     what was the Tom Mooney Labor School, and was that in San Francisco or in Los Angeles? The FBI report doesn't really make
                     that clear.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The Tom Mooney Labor School was in San Francisco. I don't think it was called the Tom Mooney Labor School [predecessor to
                     the California Labor School]—maybe it was referred to that way. I don't remember ever playing cards there.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I was in some poker games. As I remember them, they were at private homes, mostly with people from the ILWU [International
                     Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union], including Harry Bridges, [Mervyn] Rathborne, and, I believe, Henry Schmidt. I don't
                     remember. I know that Dorothy Healey sometimes was in some of those games, but I don't remember if I was ever in the
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">119</span> ―
                     </div>game with her. I did have some nights with some substantial losses and some nights with substantial winnings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But I don't remember the figure ninety dollars, which at that time was an awful lot of money. It's possible, but I think unlikely
                     that it was that much. You know, I think it's one of those exaggerated stories that has a basis of truth in it. I think the
                     place is wrong. It sounds like one of those stories that have gone from mouth to mouth to mouth and gotten exaggerated, but
                     starting with a kernel of truth in it. So I believe probably, first, the game I actually participated in, I think it was a
                     private home.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We sometimes— Oh, what we used to do, and this may be where that came from, we used to take money out of a pot that would
                     go for the labor school or some other benefit. For example, you take fifty cents or a dollar out of each pot, or some such
                     amount, and then that would go in, be set aside as a contribution. But I don't think we ever played cards at the labor school
                     itself. So it might have been a fifteen-, twenty-, or maybe thirty-dollar loss. Had got blown up to ninety dollars.

                     attendance at a conference of the Simon Lubin Society in San Francisco. This is an organization that, according to the FBI,
                     had an office in the Phelan Building [760 Market Street] in San Francisco. Does that ring a bell at all?

                     on your activities as well as other people's. In the FBI reports, they're identified as sources, with numbers: source one,
                     source three, source four, so on—so forth. At one point, a 1937 report mentions apparently in the context [that] this individual

                     that time, the FBI placed a thirty-day, so-called mail cover on your residence, as the parlance goes. They were reading your
                     mail during that period of time. Did you experience episodes where your mail began to come late during periods of time, things
                     like this, or was this done in such a way that it was not detectable by you? Later, during the Hollywood Ten hearings, where
                     the Hollywood Ten were going before HUAC [House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities] in '47, '48, there was a

                     was just something that you found out later.

                  <p class="noindent">I think I can answer it in this way. Periodically, over the years, there have been periods when there have been strange things
                     happening to my mail. Whether that was so in this precise time, in 1944, I just don't remember. There must have been periods
                     of weeks or months—ten, twelve such periods— over the years, and I think that's all I can tell you about it.

                     is ask you— I know that in 1943 you made a decision to leave the Gladstein firm in San Francisco and come down to Los Angeles.

                  <p class="noindent">There were two matters: one personal and one professional and political. When I say professional and political, those two
                     were so much combined in my life that they were pretty much one and the same.

                  <p class="noindent">Personal consideration was that I had a young son, a little over a year old at the time, whose health was bad. The doctor
                     had said that the damp climate was bad for him and that if I lived in a place like Los Angeles, it would be much better for
                     his health. I considered at that time moving down the [San Francisco] Peninsula where it was drier. That would have meant
                     a difficult transportation problem.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And then, virtually concurrently with that, there was a develpment in which I was asked to come to Los Angeles and help organize
                     an office to represent all of the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations] unions in the Southern California area. I think
                     I may have told you before that I did a lot of the out-of-town trial work for my San Francisco firm, much of it in [Los Angeles].
                     There was a period of, oh, I don't know, two or three years maybe, whenever there was a case that any of the internationals
                     we represented considered important, one of us would go to Los Angeles to participate, and I think 90 percent of the time
                     that one was me. So I had been doing a lot of work there and had established friendships and relationships.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I was asked, by I think it was by Phil [Philip] Connelly, Slim Connelly, who was then I guess the secretary of the Los Angeles
                     CIO Council, if I would consider doing that. This was about the time, or shortly after the time, that Al [Abraham Lincoln]
                     Wirin left the firm that had been doing the CIO work, and the people there felt that the firm needed strengthening. So when
                     I had that opportunity, along with the personal need, I accepted it and moved to Los Angeles for the purpose of helping organize
                     a new firm.

                     auctioneers. He was a very close friend of Harry Bridges. I had become quite friendly with him [Katz] during my rather frequent
                     visits to Los Angeles. And he was invited also to become a member of the firm. He had not done any labor work before, although
                     he had contributed to and participated in various cause matters, and was a very active supporter of the labor movement.

                     I'm sorry, am I pronouncing it correctly? Milton Tyre gave some secret testimony to HUAC, which later came out. To set the

                  <p class="noindent">Well, Milton Tyre was then, and I guess still is, very able. Then a young man, a hard worker, and an important asset to our
                     firm when we started it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He had a brother, Norman Tyre, who was a member at that time of the firm of [Martin] Gang—oh, Gang, something, and Tyre, it
                     was then. It since changed its name. Or was it Gang— Then there was a middle name of a fellow, who has since died, and Tyre
                     [Gang, Kopp, and Tyre]. They were a Hollywood firm representing many, many big Hollywood stars and directors. During the blacklisting
                     days in Hollywood, Gang was a clearing house for blacklisted people. Would help them prepare affidavits in which they talked
                     about themselves and their friends and so forth—and got cleared. Worked closely with [Roy M.] Brewer and others in this sort
                     of thing. So far as we knew—and still as far as I know—Norman Tyre, although he was a member of the firm, himself had nothing
                     to do with it. As a matter of fact we were friendly with Norman Tyre, who on one occasion represented the firm. (If you want
                     to, I can tell you about that later.)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They started to investigate, apparently, lawyers. We knew we were all being investigated, and the hearing was probably going
                     to come up. By that time, by the way, I think Milton had already left the firm. This was about— No, no, Milton left the firm
                     about '48, '49, I believe around there, at the time when we lost most of the CIO unions, because we continued to represent
                     only the left-wing unions. And so the labor work was reduced to maybe 10 percent of what it had been. But we left on very
                     warm, friendly terms. Kaplan left at the same time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then later on when the pressure started coming on, apparently what happened was that Milton went to his brother Norman and
                     said, "Jeez, I want
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>out of this thing." Norman utilized Gang to arrange a session, a secret session, of Milton before the committee, or a subcommittee,
                     with a promise that it would never be indicated that he had testified and that he would be excused from being called if and
                     when there were public hearings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, he testified. He testified that he had been a member of the Communist Party and others [too], including myself. I think
                     he must have named fifteen or twenty other names, people who were members of the Communist Party. And I guess he assumed that
                     was the last he would hear of it. Then when they had the public hearings, which was, I guess, '56 or so; I don't remember
                     the exact— No, it may be earlier than that, '53?

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Yes, I don't remember exactly when. Oh, it must have been shortly after the Smith Act trial was completed, which would have
                     been '52 or '-3. There was a session of the un-American committee of all lawyers, including myself. I think a total of twenty-five
                     lawyers, if I remember correctly. There's been a tape made of parts of the testimony called "Voices of Resistance." (I can
                     give you a copy of it if you want it.)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">During the course of that hearing, or the separate hearing, Milton Tyre was called and asked questions about himself. At that
                     point, he refused to answer and claimed the Fifth Amendment. They then pulled out his testimony that he'd given in secret
                     and read it, in public; thus, revealing that he had attempted to protect himself in the manner that ultimately failed him.

                     politically, and we thought very highly of him. At all times when he was with the firm, he worked hard and well, and made
                     a real contribution—reliable sort of a person. It was just a terrible shock when we found out about it. For me personally
                     and I guess for John [T.] McTernan, too, we felt completely betrayed by this and felt that what he'd done was worse than having
                     come out in the open and becoming an informer. Since then, Milton Tyre has tried very hard to ingratiate himself with people
                     on the liberal or Left side. He has particularly attended ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] meetings. His wife is a member
                     of the ACLU Foundation board.

                     done and that sort of thing. But, as far as my personal contact with him is concerned, it's limited to having learned these
                     things and having seen him occasionally and having refused to talk to him, or have anything to do with him.

                     organizing of the new law firm in Los Angeles, Katz, Gallagher, and Margolis, what, in addition to labor cases which of course
                     we've discussed, what other types of work was the firm doing?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, what the firm was doing regularly was, I would say, 75 to 80 percent representing labor unions; 10 or 15 doing what
                     was then called workmen's compensation (it's now workers compensation). I would say maybe 5 percent, maybe 10 percent, doing
                     political and cause matters like the Sleepy Lagoon case, and then perhaps here and there, incidentally, some other kind of
                     case. But our practice was virtually all labor or labor related.

                     The case of <i>Abelleira</i> v. <i>District Court of Appeal</i> was mentioned. But I wonder if at this point we could go into a little more detail, if you could outline some of the issues.
                     I know that there were a series of cases on the rights to unemployment compensation of workers and various unions.

                     who's your partner today in 1984, that about forty years ago, more or less, the two of you met and began working together.
                     Now, we talked earlier about how you met. I believe we had some discussion of how you met during some of the—in the late thirties
                     during some of the cases, up in the Bay Area, and how you first made his acquaintance. Why don't you tell me now how McTernan
                     happened to come to the law firm.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay, let me add to what I told you before. We became very good personal friends in addition to working together in these
                     cases. We liked each other. Enjoyed working with each other. John, however, was at that time a government— Working with the
                     NLRB [National Labor Relations Board], and had a good and important job with them. He later became during the war, he became
                     chief counsel for the San Francisco office of the NLRB. And then he was moved during the war to chief counsel of the OPA office
                     in San Francisco, Office of Price Administration.

                  <p class="noindent">After I came to Los Angeles, we were still looking for additional people—we had I believe eight or nine lawyers, eventually
                     ended up with eleven or twelve—and I heard that John had been terminated at the OPA. He was terminated for political reasons—political
                     activities. I wrote to him or telephoned him, I don't recall which. Maybe saw him. Told him that I would like him to consider
                     coming and joining our firm in Los Angeles. You know, it was the kind of work in which he was eminently qualified because
                     of his years with the NLRB and also where his interests lie. He expressed his interest. After negotiations back and forth,
                     I think it was the latter part of '43 that he came and joined the firm, originally

                     quite how long, he became a full partner. Probably some time in '44 or '45. And we have been together ever since.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, among the leading members of the firm, at least those who had their names on the front door—Charles Katz, Leo Gallagher,
                     yourself and John McTernan—was there any division of labor, as it were, in terms of the types of cases that you took? Or specialization?

                  <p class="noindent">One of the things that happened was, as far as Charles Katz was concerned and Blum were concerned, Charles was supposed to,
                     more or less, gradually give up the kind of work he was doing. Come over into full-time labor work, participating in the handling
                     of the more important cases, because he was, as I say, a very, very highly qualified lawyer. It didn't work out that way.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What happened was that, Charles, Charlie, did very— He did some labor work, but really very, very little. He kept on with
                     his practice. What was going on was that he and Blum almost had their own little office in our larger office, because the
                     rest of us had nothing to do with the work he was doing, and he had very little to do with the work that the rest of us were
                     doing. Although I must say, he participated in conferences and did make contributions of that kind. But he didn't become a
                     labor lawyer to any real extent. And in about, again my estimates of time are bad, but in about two years, maybe a little
                     longer, he left the firm. It just never worked out.

                     charges and various other kinds of labor work, almost every kind.

                     amount of the NLRB work, and the major consulting work with the, oh, with the CIO. I participated in counsel meetings. I was
                     the CIO representative to various things where they wanted to designate a lawyer. For example. HICCASP [Hollywood Independent
                     Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions]. That's how I got to know some of the Hollywood people, with whom

                  <p class="noindent">John McTernan gradually worked his way into doing what I was doing. That took him a little while because his experience had
                     been exclusively with the NLRB, whereas my experience had been much more across the board. But within a year, he was handling
                     all of the same kinds of things I was doing. And we, we had a tremendous amount of work.

                     with the office, although he is retired. (He still has his name on the door here). And a girl, a girl, a young woman named
                     Thelma [S.] Herzig, very able young woman. (Her husband was a patent lawyer. And her husband was one of the ones who testified
                     before the House Un-American Committee—one of their friendly witnesses.) At that time there came, again, the break with her,
                     although she had left the firm before that because of child. She was pregnant a couple times. Had a couple of children and
                     left because of an inability to carry on both kinds of work. There was also a young woman who did that kind of work by the

                     some other work occasionally, other than labor work. Sometime in the forties, shortly before or about the time of the Hollywood
                     Ten case— Shortly before, we had a case—we had an investigator who worked for the office who had a claim—to impose a trust
                     on an estate where he had a claim that a woman had promised him a certain amount of money for various things that he had done.
                     And Al Gitelson— I represented—his name was [Stuart N.] West, <i>West</i> v. <i>Stainbach.</i></p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent"><i>West</i> v. <i>Stainbach</i> I think is the name of the case. Gitelson represented the estate; I represented West. We tried the case, and got a judgment
                     [for] $30,000 or $40,000, which was a lot more money then than it is now. I remember we were all up before a very old judge,
                     a very good judge. I can't remember his name [Henry M. Willis]. We argued a motion for a new trial, and Gitelson— I arrived
                     there on the morning of the argument for the motion for a new trial, and Gitelson had laid out on a table, I think, at least
                     a hundred books, all with slips of paper in each of them. He was going to argue— He was going to cite all of these cases.
                     The judge let him go on for an hour or so and then cut him off. The motion for a new trial was decided against him.

                  <p class="noindent">He took an appeal, and he wrote one of the longest briefs in that kind of a case that I've ever seen. And then did something
                     very unusual. I've never seen done before or after it. He had cited a large number of cases, and he had the cases printed
                     up and put in a bound volume for the court. I remember very well, because it was such a unique experience, getting up to argue
                     the case before him in the court of appeals. And the first thing that— He was the appellant so he argued first. The first
                     thing that the presiding justice said to him is, "Mr. Gitelson, did you prepare this brief, and did you prepare this appendix?"

                     I have never seen anything— You know, you give a court this kind of a brief to read on a relatively, relatively unimportant
                     case— Anyway, he lost that case. He filed a petition for the supreme court, and they denied a hearing.

                     He overdid everything that he did. He was a confident man, but you know how somebody— A good cook who over-cooks things; well,
                     he was a good lawyer who overtried things. It was that kind of a thing. But I've always had a high regard for him. He was

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, you mentioned earlier that at one point the firm lost, or no longer was representing, most of the CIO unions, but just
                     primarily Left unions. As things developed and as I understand it, certain unions got kicked out of the CIO—a lot of ferment
                     there. What effect did this have on the financial stability of the firm and on the firm itself?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, the amount of work was reduced very, very drastically. We continued to have some labor work and some workmen's compensation
                     work, and were taking in other work that we had not been interested in doing before. We were forced to cut down on the size
                     of our firm. That was the time when Milton Tyre left, Victor Kaplan left, and a number of other people left. We cut down our
                     firm, I think if I remember correctly, to about five people.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, coincidentally, I guess perhaps not coincidentally, because they were politically related, it was about this time that
                     John McTernan and I became employed full-time, virtually, in political cases. So we went from full-time labor— There was a
                     transition period when we were doing both, but there was a period of a number of years when John and I did virtually nothing
                     except political cases. So they were left carrying on—I think three or four people in the office who were carrying on—with
                     what we had, [and] lining up other things.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We were fortunate in that we had done reasonably well financially while we were the big labor office, at least by standards
                     at that time. Had saved some money and accumulated some reserve for the firm, and we had some fees coming in at the time,
                     like that <i>West</i> v. <i>Stainbach.</i> I think we had a—we made a $15,000 fee, or something, in it. That was a lot of money in those days. It was
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">136</span> ―
                     </div>those things that helped us carry on while we were doing the political work, for most of which we were getting either nothing
                     or very, very little. And so that was the income of the office, probably dropped by maybe 75 percent or somewhere along those
                     lines. And the number of people dropped by 60 percent or two-thirds perhaps. The office was having a tough time. For a number
                     of years, we lost money. We got into debt. And there came a time, later on, when John and I looked at each other and said
                     we better get into something where we can make something before we have to go into bankruptcy.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Balter</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Was there a point at which the firm ran into a situation, where, for political reasons, there were people who wouldn't come
                     to you? Or where word got around this is a left-wing law firm, this is a communist law firm, things of that sort?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, I'm sure that that sort of thing obviously went on. But we really didn't have an opportunity to test it, because, as
                     the labor work ended, John and I became so totally involved in the political work that we weren't able to handle any other
                     work, even if people had come to us. We were totally involved. The other people left in the firm weren't as well known; didn't
                     have the contacts that John and I had. So it was understandable in any event that they wouldn't come to the firm. However,
                     I'm sure that we were affected by this.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I must say something that I have never been able to explain altogether, but which was true. When John and I finally decided
                     that we had to get in and build a new kind of practice for our own economic survival, we built up a reasonably good practice
                     in a relatively short period of time. I don't know how many people didn't come to us. But I can tell you this, again a very
                     interesting thing: that the left-wing people for whom we did political work for little or nothing, with rare exceptions, never
                     came to us with their money cases. The exceptions were

                     </div>rare. There were a few, but most of them went to other lawyers for their legal works.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The work we got was from nonpolitical people. The political people were afraid to come to us. The fact of the matter is that
                     we had the interesting experience that while we got pushed around, like everybody else did all over the place, in political
                     cases, when we were handling nonpolitical cases, we almost invariably got as good, if not better, treatment than other lawyers.
                     The fear of the left-wing friends was real, but wasn't justified by what happened.
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">What fear exactly was being expressed?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, they were the people who saw us go into court. They'd attend the political cases we handled. Saw us get pushed around,
                     maltreated, saw us, you know— Indicate that anything we did, the court would do the opposite. We were pariahs. But it wasn't
                     <i>we</i> who were the pariahs, really, as it turned out; it was the causes we were handling. And that were these— I can later on tell
                     you some interesting stories about what some of the worst bastards of judges in the political cases did for us when we got
                     into private work: how well they treated us and how personally decent they were to us.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Balter</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Okay, and we will have an opportunity to get into some of that. What I'd like to do now is turn to one of your most celebrated
                     cases, which is your work on the appeal on the Sleepy Lagoon case. If I understand correctly, you were not involved at the
                     trial in the Sleepy Lagoon case during the trial. George Shibley and other attorneys were—and you came in on the appeal?

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">That is correct. As a matter of fact when the case was being tried, I was practicing law in San Francisco. This case was tried
                     in Los Angeles. There were, I think, five lawyers who tried it, but the only really effective lawyer was George Shibley, who
                     was the lead lawyer. He was the one that, by the quality of his trial work and by the courage he had in resisting the court,
                     made a

                  <p class="noindent">How did you get involved in the Sleepy Lagoon case?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As I've told you, I was a very active member of the National Lawyers Guild ever since its foundation. During that period of
                     time, we used to have annually or biannually guild state conferences, consisting primarily of Los Angeles, and San Francisco,
                     and Oakland lawyers, who would meet either in Los Angeles or in San Francisco. We'd have there sort of miniconferences, we'd
                     have panels and discussions, and discuss statewide things. A very active member of the Los Angeles chapter of the guild was
                     an attorney by the name of Clore Warne, who was a member of the Pacht firm, Isaac Pacht [Pacht, Pelton, and Warne]. Clore,
                     who was a social democrat, was a very active, hardworking, and able guy. We worked together at various conferences. I was
                     very active in those conferences, and we got to know each other through the guild. I remember this fairly distinctly that
                     I got a— While I was still in San Francisco— but it was generally known that I was planning and preparing to move—I got a
                     call from Clore, saying he wanted to come in and see me.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "Sure. [Is] it a guild matter?"</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Came in, told me that he had been working very closely with Carey McWilliams. (He was a <i>very</i> close personal friend of Carey McWilliams, perhaps one of the two or three closest friends that Carey had in Los Angeles.)
                     And that George Shibley had gone into the service and that he [Clore] and Carey had established a Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee.
                     He told me about the case, the importance of the case, and that he and Carey had discussed it. That they had decided that
                     as long as I was coming to Los Angeles, would I be interested in, or be willing to undertake, to handle, the case. They told
                     me that from a fee standpoint, they would raise fees and costs. They would raise money, but undoubtedly we would not get as
                     well paid as we would for other work. And
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>they wanted an attorney who they felt that they could rely on to do a good job regardless of whether the attorney was well
                     paid or not.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I agreed to undertake the case. It so happened that shortly after I moved and opened up my office there, we got the transcript,
                     and it began to become necessary to work on the brief. I worked for the next year or so quite closely with Clore, with Carey
                     McWilliams, and with the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee. And wrote the brief. There were a number of other people who did
                     work on the brief. I did the final writing of the brief, but there were several people in the office who did work on this.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I have, according to my notes, one of the people who apparently worked with you—you've already mentioned—Selma Bachelis.
                     And also I understand that Frank McTernan, John McTernan's brother, was involved in some way.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I can tell you about that. There is an attorney by the name of Abe [Abraham J.] Isserman. Abe was one of the attorneys
                     in the [Eugene] Dennis case, and was a good friend of mine. Abe was disbarred. He was the <i>only</i> attorney in the <i>Dennis</i> case who was disbarred. Remember they were all charged with contempt and so forth? He was disbarred in New Jersey. As a matter
                     of fact, he is the only attorney in the history of the United States who has been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court, attorney
                     admitted to practice there, without being admitted to any other court in the land. Because the Supreme Court refused to oust
                     him when New Jersey ousted him.

                  <p class="noindent">Anyway, he was having a bad time. He wanted to come and join our firm. He was also an extraordinarily able guy, and we were
                     delighted to have him. And he was in the process of getting a divorce, I believe, and remarrying. He had been separated from
                     his wife for many years. So in the course of coming to Los Angeles, he stopped at Las Vegas to live there for, I guess, three
                     months

                     </div>or some period of time that was necessary then in order to establish residence to get the divorce there.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">During the time that he was there, I sent him some work to do on the Sleepy Lagoon case. Frank McTernan had been in the service,
                     or was still in the service, and somehow got to spend several weeks in Las Vegas and did some work with Abe Isserman doing
                     that. So there were two other people. They were all doing bits and pieces of the case.

                     for a number of years but in a most meager kind of way, not really the kind of practice— You know, going in and pleading people

                     in the trial court or to have the attempt to present the points. If a trial judge does something wrong, but there is no objection,
                     then you have no point on appeal.

                  <p class="noindent">George was the only one who made a record. For example, one of the most terrible things about that case was that the attorneys
                     were virtually barred from communicating with their own clients during the time that the trial was going on. George was the

                     none of them—I may be overstating it, but to the best of my recollection—none of the other attorneys ever did anything of

                     do you see a difference between the courts back then in terms of the degree of prejudice which would be expressed from the

                     they might feel it, but no one would say the things he did. No one would make the kind of orders that he made, today, unless
                     he was crazy. And yet in those days, while he was probably extraordinarily bad, there were other judges who would run him
                     a close second.

                     this kind of a situation. That was the important thing. The record was so full of errors that the most incompetent lawyer
                     would stumble over it. You know, it was <i>there.</i> But you had to present it in a way to grab the court, which so often, even on appeal, justices disregarded these things.
                     And I think the important contribution that that case made is that it began to achieve a change in that area.

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, yes. It was one of the most active committees that I have ever had any contact with. There was a woman by the name of
                     Alice Greenfield [McGrath]—still around—who was completely and diligently dedicated to that case. Worked on it, you know,

                     which had been a dormant community, which had no such activity. That was another important contribution on the organizational
                     end: that the community began to organize itself around this case and laid a basis for the future. Also, the victory in the
                     case created the concept that you can win some of them; you don't lose all of them. And we've had a fair— Tremendously important
                     organizational stimulant. In addition to that, there were many—quite a number of Hollywood people who were really dedicated
                     to the case. When I say I was active in the case, I— There were many meetings; I spoke at quite a few about the case. I attended

                     Rita Hayworth there. I think it was to get money. We didn't have money for putting in the briefs or something. And he gave

                     on, a person that was involved was Charlotta Bass. Anything, you know, on the Left to progressive, and I'm really not exaggerating.
                     So that I don't think she gave a lot of time to this, but she was totally supportive of us. She was the sort of person who
                     makes some speeches about it, always talks about it. She was publishing the newspaper [<i>California Eagle</i>] of course at that time, and the newspaper carried stories about it all the time. But I would say not on a [coughs]—she wasn't

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I don't remember them too much as of that time, except for a couple of outstanding ones. I particularly remember Henry
                     Leyvas, who was the oldest and the most extraordinary member of that group. I think he was twenty-two, something like that
                     at the time, and the youngest was about fourteen or fifteen. Many of them had little or nothing to say— But there were a few
                     that were very interesting. See, when I met with them, first of all, initially I felt a great resistance on their part to
                     any really close discussion about themselves or
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">148</span> ―
                     </div>anything of that kind. They had grown to trust George. They had been with him in this long trial. But, generally speaking,
                     they had a great distrust of Anglos. You know, to them, big-shot boy, who's he?—things of that kind. So mostly when I met
                     with them, they would communicate with me very, very little. Henry Leyvas to some extent was an exception. It was mainly my
                     talking to them, telling them about the things in the case. My main purpose really in going to them was to try to give them
                     hope and a reason for believing that they had a chance.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Their original concept of the case was that they had no chance at all. They had seen what had happened to them in the trial.
                     They knew generally what happened to people in the community, and they had— They thought I was soft-soaping them. That I was
                     trying to make a good thing for myself, get myself a lot of publicity, and, hey, wasn't really concerned about them. That
                     was their initial reaction.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I think, to a <i>very</i> substantial extent, by the time that the case was over, it was reduced, although never completely eliminated. After the case
                     was over, we had a big party and got along very well. For a while, I saw some of them from time to time. A couple of them
                     got in trouble at times and saw me. And then I've seen them at various affairs when the play [<i>Zoot Suit</i> by Luis Valdez] was on and the motion picture. I've had some contact with them. But I would not say that I ever established
                     a close relationship with any of them, or I even got to know any of them very well, except I think I got to know Leyvas fairly
                     well—fairly well.

                  <p class="noindent">What do you think it was about Leyvas that seems to have set him apart from the others? In terms of having more of a leader
                     or—
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">He had a very strong personality. He was a natural leader. The same person, under different circumstances, whatever he's doing,
                     would, in my

                     letters that he wrote while he was in jail. We used them during the campaign. They were magnificent letters; he could express
                     himself beautifully. He had great emotions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But most important was, I think, that of all of them, he had the greatest sense that he was a member of a group that was being
                     walked on, being discriminated against, and that he was going to fight against it. He never really established the idea that
                     he would be able to come out in a normal—any acceptable manner to carry on the fight. But he was going to carry on the fight
                     wherever he was. <i>Nobody</i> was going to walk on Henry Leyvas. That was— That was just it. And regardless of what would happen to him, he was totally
                     courageous and, you know, no physical fear as far as you could tell. Very headstrong. But he understood what was going on
                     in a very fundamental sense: what was going on, and how the people were being affected. I think they all understood it to
                     some extent, but not really at that kind of a fundamental understanding that I think Leyvas had.

                  <p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, I remember that I was— I don't think I've ever been more worked up about an argument than I was about
                     that one. Let me explain what I mean by that. Certainly, let's take the Smith Act argument in the Supreme Court. It was fundamentally
                     more important, more basic, and I was certainly very, very deeply involved and very deeply concerned and outraged. But I didn't
                     have the same sense of <i>personal</i> outrage: of just how <i>indecent</i> this whole thing had been that had been done to these, mostly youngsters. It was

                     </div>such a picture of what our society did to minorities that I think of all the arguments that I've ever made in court—and I've
                     made a few—I think I was more worked up on that kind of an emotional level on that argument than I have ever been. I was told
                     I made quite an emotional argument to the court.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The other thing that I recall, the court had apparently read the briefs and was quite receptive. The argument was not at all
                     an uphill fight, at least I didn't feel so. There was one judge who asked a few unfriendly questions, but on the whole the
                     court was very friendly, and unfriendly to the prosecutors. So that's basically what I remember about it. It was not, you
                     know, in a way— People, you know, [say] it was a wonderful job and so forth. It was one of the easier cases I have ever had
                     to handle, in many, many ways.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, that brings to mind a question. Was there anything unusual— Well, let me back up and ask you this way. You implied that
                     this was something that happened a great deal, that minority youth went to jail on very flimsy evidence, I think. And certainly
                     that was one of the points that was being made by the defense committee at the time. Was it unusual in this type of a case
                     for the defendants to get a second chance, to get a chance, to be heard by an appeals court? Was it unusual in that sense
                     for this to happen?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Generally, there were no appeals taken. Quite often there were no appeals taken at all. In the first place, you want to remember
                     that the great majority of cases involving the young Mexican-Americans, or any young racial group, are of comparatively minor
                     offenses. I don't mean by that to say that's not important. But they'd involve three years in jail, a year for five-year probation.
                     Most of them [were] on that kind of an order. They didn't have the— And it was usually an individual here, or two or three
                     individuals.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Here, you had a group of fourteen: <i>all</i> convicted of murder and from fourteen years up to twenty-two years [of age]. So that it was a case that had a
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">151</span> ―
                     </div>combination of qualities that most individual cases did not have, in many different ways. So, it was unusual because of that.
                     The cases— These were people without money. They could take appeals and have a lawyer appointed, and they'd do a half-ass
                     job. You know there wasn't a great deal— It was sort of accepted to a very large extent. And the courts didn't bother much
                     with this kind of appeal. The important thing in this case was to get the attention of the court. It was a wonderful case
                     in which to do it, because it was all there. Everything that you wanted to argue was there. All spelled out. So it was an
                     opportunity to do something that wasn't easy to do in those days.

                  <p class="noindent">Let me ask you one more thing, and then I think that will be it for today. I know that several years ago when <i>Zoot Suit,</i> the play, and <i>Zoot Suit,</i> the movie, came out, that some of the handful of the defendants in the case, in <i>People</i> v. <i>Zamora,</i> sued Gordon Davidson and Luis Valdez and others, who had been involved. I was wondering whether you had come across any information
                     that would lend some explanation as to why that all of a sudden took place.

                     said that they should have been paid some money for the use of their lives, and they weren't given anything. I think someone,
                     who just wanted to stir something up, got to these guys and started it. I don't think anything ever happened.

                     ways to what was to come shortly after. I understand that shortly after you came to Los Angeles, in about 1945 when the Conference
                     of Studio Unions [CSU] called a major strike in Hollywood, that you were involved in representing some of the strikers, particularly
                     at Warner Brothers [Pictures, Inc.]. As a matter of fact, I understand you were thrown off the Warner Brothers back lot at
                     one point. I wonder if you could give me the background to your involvement in that?

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. Our firm represented a number of Hollywood unions. While it is true that the incident that you are referring to occurred
                     at Warner Brothers, the employees we represented were employees of certain categories, who worked throughout the industry.
                     The incident happened at Warner Brothers, where the picket line was being maintained. We represented the [Screen] Office Employees
                     [Guild], the Screen Cartoonists [Union], [Local] 698 of the IATSE [International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees],
                     Screen Publicists Union, and I think one other that I can't remember. Throughout the strike we were— I particularly was working
                     in this area from my office, and I think for a couple of months spent virtually every minute of the night and day in connection
                     with this case.

                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They were mainly legal issues relating to picketing. Although we also to some extent participated in negotiations which were
                     not really legal issues, the question— I'll give you an example of one which got us into trouble, out of which we got rather
                     rapidly, but initially started trouble. The employers went in and got an injunction—a temporary restraining order, which is
                     obtained without notice—against mass picketing at Warner Brothers and against any interference with strikebreakers going through
                     the picket lines.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Soon as we learned of it, we drafted a cross complaint in which we charged that the police department was discriminating and
                     was beating up strikers and otherwise interfering with their rights. When we finished this—it was late at night—we went to
                     a judge's home. We wanted a temporary restraining order for the next morning. I think the picket line usually started at five
                     a.m., or maybe it was five-thirty or six. We wanted a restraining order before then to serve on the police. The regular clerk's
                     office was closed before our complaint was finished, so we went to a judge's home and paid the filing fee there, as I remember
                     it. He signed the restraining order, so that the next morning we were able to serve the police with a restraining order at
                     the same time that the strikers were being served with restraining orders.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Charges were then filed against several of us before the state bar, it being claimed that we had acted improperly in getting
                     a temporary restraining order, based on a complaint that had not been properly filed; that a complaint had to be filed in
                     the clerk's office; and that by doing what we did, we in effect misrepresented to the police that we had a valid restraining
                     order. Our position was that the court was wherever the judge was, and the judge had the right to file the complaint and to
                     issue the restraining order.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There were a number of hearings on the issue. There was no direct law

                     </div>on the question. Finally, the state bar dropped the charges against us without ever formalizing it. In other words, what they
                     did— What they do is they start an investigation. Then if they feel that the investigation has sufficient basis, then they
                     file formal charges, and there's a formal hearing. We had a number of informal hearings, and they dismissed the charges.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay, the question I was starting to ask you— I was a little bit mystified by the people bringing <i>you</i> up on charges of misrepresentation, when the judge certainly fully knew the circumstances and you mentioned that there was
                     no law on this issue. Is this something that came up—

                  <p class="noindent">There was no law on the issue of whether or not a complaint could be filed anywhere other than at the clerk's office. You
                     understand, the everyday common practice and the one that's always followed is that you take the complaint and file it with
                     the clerk, and then if you're going to see a judge, you take the filed complaint to the judge. There's <i>no</i> law that says that that's the <i>only</i> way to do it. And there's no law that says that you can or can't do it by filing with the judge. The proceedings in my opinion
                     were simply for harassment. And that's all they did was harass us.

                  <p class="noindent">Not to us as attorneys that I can recall, but we were constantly in court in connection with injunctions. There were all kinds
                     of criminal cases; that

                     </div>is, people were charged with assault and battery, with blocking and trespassing and refusing to disperse. You name it, all
                     of those common kinds of offenses. We tried people in bunches: three hundred, four hundred in a bunch because there were thousands
                     of people arrested during this [strike]. People would go out, get out of jail, go back on the picket line, and be rearrested.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It was a very bitter struggle in which the workers were <i>very</i> militant. Fought very hard. As a matter of fact, one of the things that happened is that there were so many people arrested
                     that they didn't have room for them. They had to begin releasing some of the people who were being held without bail (because
                     they didn't put up bail) in order to make room for others. So it was that kind of a thing that was going on. It went on for
                     about three months on a day-and-night basis.

                  <p class="noindent">I'm just trying to remember whether— In some instances, we'd start the trial, then work out some sort of a deal where people
                     would get off with the time that they'd already been in jail, or some sort of a very short, summary probation. Things of that
                     kind. As I remember it, and I'm not positive about this, but my recollection is that, aside from the time that people were
                     in jail without having put up bail, people did not serve time in jail. There may have been some exceptions, but I don't recall
                     them.

                  <p class="noindent">The biggest case we had that we finally got thrown out on appeal was one in which the principal defendant was Herb [Herbert
                     Knott] Sorrell. Herb Sorrell was the business agent of the painters union. And was the center— He was the president of the
                     Conference of Studio Unions, to which all of these unions that we represented and many other unions that we did not represent
                     belonged. He was the president of that conference and really ran the strike, both in 1956 and

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah, 1945 and '46. That's right, 1945 and '46. He was charged— I don't remember whether it was the first or the second strike,
                     because they run together in my mind. Except for certain, very sharp differences, they run together in my mind. He and several
                     others were charged with a conspiracy to violate various laws. For example, trespassing or obstruction are misdemeanors, but
                     a conspiracy to do those things is a felony under California law. And so that was a serious charge.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They were really going after him in a big way. We had various hearings on injunctions and other things that went on and on.
                     That case was finally dismissed. I don't remember now whether it was dismissed as a result of our going to the appellate court,
                     or whether we got it dismissed in the trial court. We were going up on appeal on things. It was just a constant turmoil, with
                     cases piling up on cases. The major difference between the two years was that in 1945, the first strike, the strike was settled
                     on a basis reasonably satisfactory to the unions. I think it could have been called a modest victory for the union. Certainly,
                     it was not a defeat for them. On the other hand, they didn't achieve everything that they wanted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The second strike, 1946, was a different story. The strike went on and on for months. By that time the employers—the studios—were
                     absolutely determined that they were going to break Herb Sorrell, and the Conference of Studio Unions, regardless of the cost.
                     It was clear that they would no longer— That they were going to fight this through to the end, if necessary.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I think I can tell you a little bit about the background of that. There was an unusual situation in the studios of that time.
                     On the one hand, there was the IATSE. Most of the IATSE Hollywood unions— All, with the exception of [Local]
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>698 which we represented, were pretty much under the control of a racketeering international who played— That was the Bioff
                     group from olden days. They were led by Roy [M.] Brewer, with whom I had many other fights. But in any event, at that time
                     they played footsie with the employers. They broke the strike, or they went in with the strikebreakers, etcetera, etcetera.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Another interesting thing is that at that time, during either one of the two years—again, I don't remember which one—a fellow
                     by the name of [Ronald] Reagan, either just had been, or was, or was about to become, president of the Screen Actors Guild.
                     He had been a, more or less, liberal Democrat. Had been, for example, a member of the board of HICCASP [Hollywood Independent
                     Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions], which was a kind of a left-democratic Hollywood group. His change,
                     from that kind of a person to what he became, began about that time. Started with his animosity to the strike. He wanted the
                     actors to go through the picket line and to break the strike. Now, I'm not sure whether he took that position the first year,
                     but I'm sure he took it the second year. There was a big fight within the Screen Actors Guild on that issue, too. Reagan led
                     the red-baiting, accusing the Conference of Studio Unions and those in the Screen Actors Guild who didn't go along with his
                     program as being reds, communists, etcetera. I think, although I'm not positive, that was pretty much the time when there
                     was a basic change in Reagan.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The second year, the employers were determined to break the strike, because Herb Sorrell had been a real power in the motion
                     picture industry in this way: Anytime you could stop production on a picture, it would cost large, large sums of money to
                     the studios. Every day of shooting was very, very expensive. The stars that they had to pay, the people who stood by, and
                     the sets that they had prepared—just a terribly expensive thing for them.
                  </p>

                  <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">159</span> ―
                  </div>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Herb Sorrell had taken care of that, or taken advantage of that, in this way: When anybody in the Conference of Studio Unions
                     had a beef, they'd go to Herb Sorrell if they couldn't settle it themselves. And Herb Sorrell would go to the producers and
                     say, "I'll call out the painters if you don't settle this beef and give them what they want." And he did call out the painters
                     a few times. It was too expensive for the employers, the studios, and so they started giving in. So that you got almost every
                     grievance settled to the reasonable satisfaction of the workers in the Conference of Studio Unions and to the great ire of
                     the studios. This was a position of such power that the studios could not tolerate. It became evident during the second year
                     that at this point the employers were not going to give in. They were either going to break the unions, or they were going
                     to work out an arrangement, an agreement, which would prevent that from reoccurring.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Most of the unions, a great majority of the unions, including all of those that we represented, took the position that they
                     wanted to settle the strike, even on the studios' terms. That the studios were willing to have an arbitration clause and so
                     forth; and that otherwise they [the unions] were going be destroyed, they felt.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Herb Sorrell said, "Absolutely not, I will not settle with them on those term or any other terms except my terms." The unions
                     who were opposed to him, and were in a great majority, were faced with the following dilemma. Oh, I must add one more thing.
                     Herb Sorrell said to those unions, "If you decide to go back to work, you're going to have to go through my picket lines."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So those unions, including the ones we represented, were faced with the following dilemma: either they had to continue with
                     a strike which was being lost and which threatened their very existence or they had to become strikebreakers. Neither of the
                     solutions, if you can call them that, were very
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>pleasant to them. There was night after night after night spent in discussion by these representatives of these various unions.
                     And I attended many of these meetings, most of them, in fact, trying to find a way out of this dilemma.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The unions finally decided that, no matter what else, they were not going to be strikebreakers. They couldn't go through Herb
                     Sorrell's picket line. They were all destroyed, including Herb Sorrel's painters. He became an automobile salesman later on.
                     He just lost all of his— You know, he had no union, nothing left. The IATSE at that point took over virtually every aspect
                     of work at the studios and has maintained it ever since.

                     what other attorneys, both from your law firm and perhaps from other law firms, were involved in representing the unions,
                     especially during this period of time?

                  <p class="noindent">I, during both of those strikes, was full time on them. John [T.] McTernan tried some cases and I think maybe some of the
                     smaller ones were tried by others in our office. The attorney for Herb Sorrell was Frank Pestana. He represented Herb, the
                     painters, and the Conference of Studio Unions. Herb Sorrell's attorney had been a man by the name of George [E.] Bodle, but
                     George Bodle went into the service and was away during the first of these strikes. Then when he came back, Sorrell retained
                     Frank Pestana in there. There was a man, who's now dead, by the name of Bill [William] Esterman, who represented some of the
                     unions. I'm trying to think of who else. There were a number of other lawyers in and out, but I think that I've named the
                     principal ones.

                     of the Conference of Studio Unions, and there was a guest from Mexico, Vincent Toledano, who at that time was one of the leading
                     labor figures in the world, I would say. He was a speaker. There were three speakers at the meeting: Herb Sorrell, Toledano,
                     and myself. The place was packed.

                  <p class="noindent">The reason I happened to remember this is because two or three years ago, when I got part of my papers from the FBI [Federal
                     Bureau of Investigation], I found in there a complete transcript of the speech that I had given on that occasion. I know that
                     they must have either taped it or somebody took notes, because I don't make speeches and never did make speeches that were
                     written and prepared in advance. I have notes, but that's all. So, it's just an interesting thing to what extent the FBI was
                     involved at that time and how important they appeared to think a speech made at a labor meeting was.

                     of HICCASP, and some of the Hollywood unions were represented on that board. I may have met—not positive of this—but I think
                     I may have met the people either at the board or as a result of people that I met at the board, and maybe some other way.

                     but I'm interested in your own memories of it.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I find it very difficult to distinguish what was going on at HICCASP from what was happening in other areas. You want
                     to remember, [when] I first came on the board, the war was going on. I know that they had activities supporting the war, but
                     all organizations had, that I was connected with, had activities of various kinds supporting the war. I know that there was
                     a difference. They planned various types of entertainment—people going to talk to troops or recruitment offices. In other
                     words, they acted in their own area, where they could contribute. I remember helping arrange a conference on civil liberties.
                     I think it was with them and the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] jointly. I'm not sure. It's very difficult to separate
                     these. They were a very liberal group. They were concerned about minority participation and discrimination. The main thing
                     was the war—war effort. I continued on the board I think for two or three years, maybe four years, but I didn't attend all
                     of the meetings. I was involved in so many things at the time. I probably attended a dozen meetings, or less, over four years.
                     I was generally familiar at that time with what they did; I don't think I can recall anything more specific.

                     not. According to my research, the impetus or one of the— The main impetus apparently to the 1945 strike, to the first strike,
                     was over the refusal of the studios to recognize one particular union, the Society of Motion Picture Interior Decorators,
                     which wanted to transfer from IATSE to CSU. Apparently, they went through some hearings before the National Labor Relations
                     Board, which supported the union. Is that consistent with your recollection?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, let's talk about that a little bit. When you first began to represent the unions which would then become part of CSU—fairly
                     soon afterwards as I understand it—was there initially any period of time when there were efforts to mend the rift between
                     the two groups, or was it essentially hopeless from the beginning?

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I know, or can recall, of no such efforts. The groups were so entirely different. The CSU were by and large very democratic
                     unions. They ran the gamut from moderately liberal or progressive to quite left-wing. They were activist organizations; they
                     were militant organizations in the labor field.

                  <p class="noindent">The IATSE on the other hand was controlled by the international from the top. Their contracts were negotiated by their top
                     people in Chicago. The rank and file of the membership had little or nothing to do with this. They had good conditions. They
                     had gotten this as a result of the power of the gangsters who had been bribed by the employers. And what the employers got
                     in return—When I say good conditions, what I mean is that they had very good wages, good hours, good fringes for that time,
                     but they caused no trouble. You never heard of an IATSE local saying, "Unless you deal with us on this grievance properly,
                     we're going to shut you down."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">From the standpoint of the studios, that was the decisive difference between the two groups: the militancy of one as compared
                     with the other. As a matter of fact, with the IATSE— There was craft unionism to the nth degree in the studios. If someone
                     was supposed to pick up a piece of wood in one category, no one else was supposed to pick up that piece of wood, regardless
                     of anything that happened. Well, the IATSE did. Was ready to and frequently did violate those craft lines as against unions
                     that were CSU or became CSU. That was part of the struggle between them. Of course, the IATSE was trying to break them, and
                     the employers were obviously on the side of the IATSE.

                     rank and file of IATSE, especially at the point at which IATSE began to be so antagonistic and cross your picket lines?

                     a bed of roses. On the other hand, the IATSE goons went after picketers with all kinds of weapons. Not guns, as far as I can
                     recall, but pieces of wood, steel bars and things of that kind—viciously.

                     anything happened, particularly if it was a lawyer, it was big news. It was front-page news for a month—everyday.

                     he was not a heavy drinker, but he looked like one of them. Had kind of a florid face, heavy built, with a pot. A dynamic
                     speaker, not a polished speaker, but dynamic and could really move an audience, particularly workers. Was really a rough,
                     tough guy. A thousand percent honest: <i>no one</i> could buy him. One of the most stubborn men I've ever met in my life—whose judgment left an awful lot to be desired—who was
                     ready to fight on every issue, good or bad.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">For him, there were two sides to every issue. One was the worker's side, and the other was the employer's side. There could
                     not be a situation in which a word could be said on behalf of the employers or against the worker. No

                     or whatever. He would fight about every issue and just as vigorously. On every issue it was one or the other. If there was
                     ever, in that sense, a class-conscious man, it was Herb Sorrell. Although from a political standpoint, if you talked to him
                     about class consciousness, he might not have known what you meant. He was not, in my opinion, a particularly good organizer,
                     except that he was a terrific speaker and could move people into action. That he was, he was tops.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, basically I suppose I say that because of one thing, although I'm sure it reflected itself many times. We disagreed
                     a great deal, but we were never unfriendly, you know. You simply could not convince him that there was any chance that the
                     strike would be lost if the people just stayed solid, and that they would stay solid indefinitely. Just couldn't convince
                     him. You try to talk to him about it, and it's no use. And this was going on. So one point you could even understand. Well,
                     this is a strong group of people. They've been very loyal, very devoted. They're fighters. Then, people start dropping off,
                     less and less people on the picket line, some people beginning to go back to work, and all of the signs of a strike disintegrating.

                     a thing. It was all over—the strike— And [Bridges] overcame the opposition of all of his people. Said, "We're going to get

                     as the second one. There was another problem. They were only a year apart. There had been a three-month strike one year, and
                     people had suffered. And then you had a strike eight or nine months later. This one was a long one, so it was very difficult.

                     for the National Lawyers Guild, full-time for a number of years, and had done— He was a person that had traveled all over
                     the world. Knew lots of people and was excellent in public relations, again, a person with excellent judgment. Marty had joined
                     or later joined a firm in New York, a law firm in New York, and at that time was already representing, as I remember, a number
                     of foreign countries. His practice became exclusively one of representing various foreign countries, including the Soviet
                     Union and the various Eastern European countries. He also represented China later.

                  <p class="noindent">I'm quite sure that he recommended Sam Rosenwein, who at that time lived in New York (Sam Rosenwein later moved to California).
                     But he [Popper] remembered Sam Rosenwein had been the counsel—was it for the Civil Rights Congress? I think it was for the
                     Civil Rights Congress, or if not them, for some other civil liberties organization for a number of years. Was a brilliant
                     lawyer and had done a tremendous amount of work in the field of constitutional law, which was not true of either Marty or
                     of Bob Kenny, although Bob knew a little

                  <p class="noindent">Bartley Crum was a San Francisco lawyer, at the time, who was an attorney for the Hearst press, and who himself, however,
                     had many liberal friends, including, for example, Harry Bridges.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Several years before that, when I was practicing law in San Francisco, there was a big strike in a company town. Westwood—the
                     Westwood Lumber Company—that's a city up in Northern California, a company-owned town.

                     </div>During the strike, the employer attempted to evict all of the workers from the houses that they lived in. They lived in the
                     company-owned houses. We represented the unions and the workers. Bartley Crum represented the employer. This must have been
                     about '39, '40, before the war, before we got into the war. And he fought bitterly for the thing. And as I— I think eventually
                     it was settled. But we considered him an archenemy of labor. Attorney for the Hearst press, a very, very successful lawyer,
                     a bright guy, a very handsome guy, and a social butterfly of considerable importance, at least from his own standpoint.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And then Bartley began to become a kind of a liberal. I'm not sure what motivated him in that direction. As I said, he acquired
                     a friendship with Harry Bridges. He began to know people in Hollywood, like Scott and Dmytryk. And he was brought into the
                     case, largely as a public relations person. He was not the kind of a lawyer who lifted a lot of law books. He was the kind
                     of a lawyer who was a front man. He later became— He then later joined one of the very large law firms in New York City, after
                     this was over.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I remember on one of my trips to New York, I visited him at this law office. He asked me if I would like to have a cup of
                     coffee. I said okay. I thought he was going to do what we do here, run out and get me a cup of coffee.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "Okay, let's go." We went over to the—which hotel was it? One of the very swank hotels in New York City. Sat down
                     and each had a cup of coffee. He was well known. The waiters are bowing all over the place, "Mr. Crum and—" The bill was five
                     dollars a cup for a cup of coffee, and that was probably about 1950 or 1951. Five dollars for a cup of coffee, which is considerable
                     today, was like twenty-five dollars for a cup of coffee today. But that was his lifestyle. He was a man who was always in
                     trouble financially. Made a lot of money and made connections. He had a wonderful personality of getting in

                     Hoffa had a pretty good relationship with Harry Bridges. They worked together on some labor disputes and so forth. Hoffa's

                     While we're talking about the lawyers, Ring Lardner wrote recently, as a matter of fact in the Journal for the National Lawyers
                     Guild dinner, which honored you a couple of years ago, that it was disconcerting sometimes to sit in front of the committee
                     and have Robert Kennedy— Excuse me—

                  <p class="noindent">[laughs] I'm doing the same thing you did. Robert Kenny says, "Take it easy", in one ear, and Ben Margolis saying, "Let them
                     have it!" in the other ear. Which, besides being a funny story, raises some questions, and that is among— And we'll get to
                     the question of differences among the witnesses later. But among the attorneys, among you and Bob Kenny and the other attorneys,
                     what sort of strategy discussions did you have to have among yourselves before you even began to have strategy discussions
                     with your clients?

                  <p class="noindent">I would say that the discussion among the lawyers alone related primarily to a legal analysis of what was the best legal position
                     to take. There

                     what should your position be. As I say, there was a relationship between the two, but they were separate. I believe that most
                     of the discussions on the second were jointly with some of the lawyers, or all of the lawyers, and the nineteen. Remember,
                     all nineteen participated in that struggle, discussion, and went back to Washington.

                     that there were discussions certainly among the nineteen and, I assume, among the attorneys too about whether to take the
                     First Amendment, the Fifth, [or] both: what the legal strategy should be. I assume that a lot of this centered around what
                     you actually wanted to accomplish. Could you outline for me what types of discussions went on, and what the considerations
                     were?

                  <p class="noindent">The lawyers I think were in agreement as to the state of the law, which, in virtually all respects, was not clearly settled.
                     There was no way you could say to them, "We have authority directly in point or even close in point, which establishes what
                     your rights are either under the Fifth Amendment or under the First Amendment." The attorneys were in agreement that whichever
                     they relied on, the First or the Fifth, they would lose in the lower courts, but both of them thought that the chances of
                     winning in the Supreme Court were anywhere from good to excellent. And we so told them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Also when the question was raised as to whether he should rely on one or the other or both, I think the advice—all of the
                     lawyers agree—that simply from a clear legal standpoint, technical legal standpoint, you rely on both. It's appropriate if
                     you have more than one defense of something, you have a— You raise

                     </div>whatever you have. Although we also said that this— Even legally there was a political fight here, and raising them both might
                     affect the political character of the fight, which in turn would reflect on the legal impact on the Court and its thinking.
                     But basically we thought that the question was one that was a policy question that had to be decided. And even when— There
                     were two considerations in deciding that policy question: One was how could you most effectively fight the committee? The
                     other was what was the best chance of saving your job? And was there any relationship between the two? But to some extent
                     they were separate questions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It was decided in the course of the discussions that, from both standpoints, the best kind of a fight could be made against
                     the committee and to save the jobs by relying on the First Amendment and the First Amendment alone. In connection with that,
                     it was pointed out that if we won on the First Amendment, the result would be that the committee's power would be shorn. It
                     would be very easy for people, from that point on, when they were asked questions concerning their political affiliations
                     to reply, "We stand, we just rely on the First Amendment." A very respectable position in the eyes of 95 percent of the American
                     people. And the committee just couldn't do anything about it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It would destroy the committee, whereas the Fifth Amendment would not destroy the committee, if you succeeded, because of
                     the impact of the Fifth Amendment itself from a public relations standpoint. The concept of "Fifth Amendment communists."
                     That while the law was that the Fifth Amendment was for the protection of the innocent—not the guilty—and that relying on
                     the Fifth Amendment was not in any way an admission of guilt, nevertheless, that's the way it would be deemed by many, if
                     not most people from a public relations standpoint. And therefore the committee, if it was merely held that there was a Fifth
                     Amendment right, could go on and flourish by making people claim the

                  <p class="noindent">So the decision was reached unanimously after lots of discussion, pro and con, with some of the nineteen placing greater emphasis
                     on their jobs and some of them greater emphasis on the destruction of the committee. Although all of them had both objectives,
                     it was just the question of where the greater concern or emphasis was. Finally, there was unanimous agreement to rely on the
                     First—the First alone.

                     nineteen, do any particular names stand out one way or the other in terms of those who most strongly argued for jobs and those
                     who most strongly argued to fight the committee? Was there enough of a polarization, so perhaps certain people were clearly
                     identified in either camp in the disagreement, in terms of what should be given priority?

                     position was <i>the</i> decisive thing. There were many that agreed with him. Well, everyone agreed that it was important, but many agreed that it
                     was the determinative thing. I don't think anybody openly said, "Well, the decisive thing is can we save our jobs?" But you
                     could draw that implication from the fact that they argued more along those lines than they did along the other. Although
                     I do think everybody had both things in mind. I think Howard Koch was one of the ones who was very concerned about his job.

                     between Albert and Ring. (I think Dalton may have been involved, but I'm not sure.) And they took diametrically opposite views
                     in which they said that— Ring said that it was jobs which was the decisive thing, and Albert said it was the political importance
                     of destroying the committee. After some exchange of letters, they agreed to ask me what my recollection was. Then I wrote
                     a letter giving them my recollection. Interestingly enough, both of them then said, "Well, that's probably right."

                     With Lardner saying—baiting more or less, as I read it—the stand that they took was what would be expected of them at the
                     time, and Maltz feeling that they didn't— That if they had only been concerned about their jobs and that if they had not been
                     somewhat more heroic, they could have just relied on the Fifth, and not gone with the First. They took the riskier road, I
                     guess, is what Maltz's point was.

                  <p class="noindent">I must tell you that my— I can give you my impression when I read the letters. That the argument about the word <i>heroic</i> was in my opinion a lot of nonsense. That is somebody's evaluation of whether a particular kind of conduct is heroic or something
                     else. What is heroic? Some people could say that fighting to save your job and standing up and risking jail is heroic. Others
                     will say that only a political objective makes it heroic. But that's, you know, to me, that is not the important thing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The important thing was, I told them, that everybody took a principled position. And that everybody, and I'm positive of this,
                     everybody expressed concern about both things. John Howard Lawson, for example, who was, you know, who was the most political
                     of all of these people, he also expressed concern— As a matter of fact, he said it was politically important to save the jobs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So there was no real disagreement. It was a question of emphasis. And it so happened that the decision was made that both
                     objectives would be best served by the First Amendment position. If we had arrived at the conclusion that, one, different
                     approaches were required to best serve the different objectives, it is my guess—and it's a guess—that the political considerations
                     would have prevailed.

                           an informer, furnishing the FBI with information about the San Francisco chapter, pronouncing himself "very happy to cooperate
                           with the FBI" in its investigation of the NLG, promising to search his files for further information, and offering to be "a
                           willing witness at any hearing concerning the NLG."

                     did, but that was not unexpected in the line of his background and position. I can't think of a single thing that even with
                     hindsight would indicate that as of that time he was planning any kind of a role other than bona fide representation of the
                     client. Remember that was 1947. He had nothing to do with the ten. After the hearings were completed in 1947, he was not involved
                     in the litigation. He was not involved in any way, except preceding the Washington hearings and during the Washington hearings.

                     he wouldn't have been admitted into the white coffee shops. This was just an accepted thing in Washington. This happened in
                     '49, '50. This man, who was really one of the fine lawyers of the United States, was treated in this manner.

                     of the lawyers, of the six lawyers who represented the witnesses, were from Washington. This man was known to, by reputation
                     at least, to all of us and personally by some of the people. I don't remember just who. And in discussing, we just discussed
                     who should we have and we kicked around the idea: so-and-so and so-and-so.

                     agree with all that the committee was doing. The question was raised—I don't remember just how it was raised, but it was planned—that
                     it would be taken up with him as to whether there would be a blacklist, whether the jobs would be protected. And he said that
                     under no circumstances would the Hollywood motion picture industry engage in anything as un-American as a blacklist. <i>Very</i> stout on that. And at that time, by the way, the public statements he was issuing were also pretty good.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, Albert Maltz in his oral history says that at least speaking for himself, that the blacklist later came as pretty much
                     of a surprise. He seemed to feel that it was not something really anticipated. What is your recollection about what people
                     were thinking, and what people were anticipating at that time?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I don't know that surprise is the correct word. I know that in the motion picture industry in Hollywood, and that industry
                     itself, there was widespread opposition to any blacklist. And not only among actors, actresses, writers, and the rank and
                     file of workers, but among the top people.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Of course from a money standpoint, among the original nineteen were some of the best money-producing artists in Hollywood.
                     Blacklisting them meant a loss of money to the industry; serious loss of money. You know, the

                     So they didn't want this. It was really, from everything I know and believe, pretty much forced on them.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, there was— Let me go back. The industry was very dependent on banks. Banking was done primarily with several major banks
                     located in New York City. The reason it was dependent on banks was because huge amounts of money were invested in pictures.
                     And it would take maybe a year, two years, three years after the investment before the proceeds arrived. So they were constantly
                     borrowing large sums of money from the bank and were dependent on that money in order to proceed with their business.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was a meeting at the Waldorf [Astoria] Hotel in New York City, and the date escapes me [November 24, 1947]. But in any
                     event, from everything I heard, and I talked to people who attended that meeting, the— It was made perfectly clear, to coin
                     a phrase, that the banks would discontinue loaning money to the industry unless the industry agreed to a blacklist. By this,
                     I don't mean to say, by the way, that there were no—that none of the producers wanted to blacklist. There were a couple that
                     wanted it. And then there were others who were flag-wavers, who wanted to show how patriotic and loyal they were.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">For example, the story about the Warner brothers is that they were very much afraid of anti-Semitism spreading during this
                     terrible period, and that they felt that they had to be holier than holy. They went along. They did not initiate that as far
                     as I know, a blacklist, but they went along very quickly and very— Or at least without any resistance and apparently quite
                     willingly, although it may not underneath have been as willing as it appeared to be.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So I suppose that it did not come as a surprise, completely, because there were rumors going around about this thing all of
                     the time. But a lot of people in

                     the nineteen and all or some of the attorneys. I think the attorneys' meeting came first if I remember correctly. It was a
                     result of the attorneys' meeting and Johnston's expressed desire to reassure the nineteen that the second meeting occurred.
                     And the second meeting was, as I remember, much shorter. Johnston just made a few statements about what their policy was,
                     and that was all there was to it.

                     because of several things. There was tremendous support in Hollywood. A whole planeload of the most prominent stars and writers
                     came to watch and then to support the nineteen. And there was big publicity. Many of the biggest newspapers were supporting
                     the nineteen. Newspapers were divided about fifty-fifty in this country. We knew that it meant money to the industry; that
                     the blacklist would cost them money. If there's anything that you should rely on in the industry, it is that they weren't
                     going to do anything that would cost them money unnecessarily. And I don't think they would have, if they hadn't been forced
                     to. But they simply could not do business without financing.

                     conduct themselves? One position was that they should answer just as briefly and as courteously and as quietly as possible.
                     They were of course going to refuse to answer certain questions, that is on the grounds of the First Amendment: the Communist
                     Party and the [Screen] Writers Guild or [Screen] Actors Guild questions. But that it would be done in a very gentlemanly,
                     polite manner. That had, as I remember it, the support of Bart Crum, and I felt the honest support of Crum; that was his way
                     to deal with something like this. Originally, if I remember correctly, it also had the support, to some extent, of Bob Kenny,
                     but I think he changed his mind.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The position that finally prevailed was an all-out-fighting position. We would fight back at the committee. Tell them what
                     we thought. To attempt to use the committee hearings as a forum to attack the committee and to express the views of the witnesses.
                     There's one exception. I'll discuss him separately.

                     the way to do it. Some of them more reluctantly than the others. If I remember correctly, one of the ones who was reluctant
                     was Lewis Milestone. He never got up to the— He finally came around. He finally agreed. But to what extent he would have actually

                  <p class="noindent">So we spent most of our time practicing. What we would do is we'd put somebody on the witness stand, so to speak. Then the
                     attorneys would pretend they were members of the committee or chairman of the committee counsel, and ask questions and practice
                     answers. And then there would be criticism, and the person will do it again. That kind of thing went on continuously; ten,
                     twelve hours a day for all of the time we were on the train.

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, we arrived in Washington. You know, there were several days of hearings before our first witness was called. And we arrived
                     in Washington a day or two before. We stayed at a hotel, the [Hotel] Shoreham, which was an old, but was then a very, very
                     plush hotel with huge grounds. One of the reasons we stayed there was because we could go outside and talk under pleasant
                     surroundings. We assumed that virtually anywhere we were, there would be some equipment to overhear what we said—wiretapping,
                     etcetera. So that was another reason we stayed there. Very pleasant, I remember, a very lovely hotel.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We carried on the work that we had done, that we started on the train. The lawyers reviewed the statements and made suggestions.
                     There were two people brought in from New York to handle public relations, whose names I don't recall at the moment. We had
                     meetings about public relations. We had meetings about approaching Johnston. There were meetings constantly going on. Somebody
                     would testify; we'd meet and talk about what to do there. Again, the details I don't recall at this time. But there was constant
                     activity going on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I remember for example— One meeting that really I think will never be eliminated from my memory as long as I live was [with]
                     Lee Pressman, who was then general counsel for the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations], Phil [Philip] Murray's general
                     counsel. And he was someone who I knew very well, because our office in San Francisco had represented two or three international
                     CIO unions. And for a period of two or three or four years, there were meetings
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">199</span> ―
                     </div>of international counsel generally a couple of times a year in Lee Pressman's office in Washington, D.C.. I attended many
                     of those meetings, so I knew him quite well. Brilliant guy. Kind of a withdrawn, standoffish guy.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But he came to this, and in effect he said that he wanted to tell people how bad things were in this country. Oh, I remember.
                     We had approached him in the first instance trying to get him to get Phil Murray to issue a statement of support.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "Well, I'd like to come and talk to you." And he said, "If you think that there's any possibility of getting a statement
                     from Murray, you're daydreaming. He would just as soon see you hung from the highest trees."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He [Pressman] says, "This country is headed for something close to fascism, and the future fate of this country lies in <i>your</i> hands." They've gone to <i>him</i> for help. [laughter] And he came and was in deep anguish. And he cried! He actually cried. I've never seen anything like
                     that. He's a very strong person. A very important person—general counsel for the CIO. Later, of course, he became an informer,
                     and then later apologized for it and so forth. That was one of the things that happened.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I remember another incident that stays very firmly in my mind. Jack [John Howard] Lawson was the first witness who got called,
                     and all of us went to the hearing, except Bertolt Brecht, who stayed in the hotel. There was no television, but it was on
                     radio. And he was listening to it on radio. Said he preferred to stay at the hotel and listen to it there. It was a very confrontational
                     day. Everybody was very excited and uptight and tense about the things that had happened during the day and the treatment
                     that the committee had given to the witnesses. Although I must say the witnesses gave back as good as they got. We came in,
                     I remember coming in and Brecht was sitting there in front of the radio with a great big smile on his mouth and just seeming
                     delighted.

                  <p class="noindent">I remember asking, "Bert, you know, the kind of a day we had, what are you laughing at? What do you see about the situation
                     to laugh, or even smile about?"
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "Nothing like this ever happened in Germany. The intellectuals folded and ran. And did not fight back." He says,
                     "I'm smiling because with people like this, you will never have fascism in the United States."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By the way, I told you originally that he was an exception to that. Brecht was a German citizen and from East Germany. He
                     was over in the United States working in the motion picture industry. He had never written anything that was produced, but
                     he had been brought over. He was considered one of the foremost writers in the world at that time, but the industry made a
                     mistake. The kind of stuff he wrote was not the kind of stuff that motion pictures produced. But in any event, he was not
                     a citizen. There was fear that if he didn't get out of the country pretty soon, some action might be taken against him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Brecht had never been a member of the Communist Party. He was very close to the communists. Had supported them. And appeared
                     at their meetings; you know, spoken for them. But he never actually had been a member. And so it was decided, of course when
                     I say it was decided— It was his position, which everybody else thought was a correct position, that he should answer questions
                     about himself and also to—just as soon as he finished testifying that he would leave—return to Germany while he's still able
                     to do so.

                  <p class="noindent">It was discussed, but there was a problem. It was decided not to try it, because there was a problem as to whether he would
                     be allowed even to board— He might have been arrested and brought back for the committee. We didn't know what they would do.
                     It was decided that it would, from a public relations standpoint also, that it would seem like he was trying to run away from
                     something. And he didn't want to do that. He did want to go back to Germany, but he didn't want to do it that way.

                  <p class="noindent">And if I understand his— The decision to have him answer questions was so that he could not be cited for contempt. He would
                     leave essentially with a clean bill of health.

                  <p class="noindent">That's right. If he had refused to answer questions, he might have had trouble leaving. Might have been on the grounds that

                     in terms of strategy is because Alvah Bessie in his book, <i>Inquisition in Eden,</i> claimed that three, the figure he uses, three of the unfriendly nineteen deposited, I guess, what you would call noncommunist
                     affidavits with their producers. Just in case, as Bessie put it, paraphrasing, just in case the strategy didn't work that
                     you all had developed. Are you aware of any of that? Does that ring a bell with you? What people might have—?

                     were not the ones who testified. You see, they called— Out of the nineteen, there were eight they never called. They called
                     the ten plus Brecht. And the people he's talking about, whether the three, I'm not sure, were among the eight. We really had
                     very little contact with them once the hearings were over—with the eight.

                     left the country shortly afterwards, including Millie, Lewis Milestone. They were trying to protect themselves in any way
                     that they could. And the filing—I don't know who filed affidavits. As a matter of fact, I've simply heard that as a rumor.
                     I don't know of firsthand knowledge that it actually happened.

                  <p class="noindent">By the way, speaking of this general area, one thing I'm interested in knowing your comments on is that when Howard— It's
                     been mentioned in many places, the fact that Howard Koch at one point took out an ad in the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> saying that although he was not a communist, he was critical of what the committee had done. I'm curious about this because
                     a lot of people have written somewhat critically about what he did as being kind of a defection, because the group had agreed
                     not to distinguish among themselves publicly whether they were communist or not. And yet Albert Maltz in his oral history
                     speaks somewhat commendably of Koch taking out that ad. I was wondering if you remember that episode, and what your own feelings
                     were about it?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">It'll take a little history that there— First of all, let me say that there <i>was</i> an agreement that people would not do what he did. And the reason for it was that if one person did it, in a way that pointed
                     the finger at those who didn't. Not intentionally, but that would be the impact that it was felt that it would have. And there
                     was such an understanding.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I must also say, however, that this happened <i>after</i> the hearings were over. When I speak of that understanding, I think we were talking in terms of what we'd do through the
                     hearings really. Anybody could say, quite honestly, that there was no such understanding about anything as to what would be
                     done, once the hearings were over. I think that's important, because I think that Howard Koch is a very honorable and decent
                     man.

                  <p class="noindent">Howard Koch was not, never has been, a member of the Communist Party. It was a truthful statement. And he—you might criticize
                     him for doing it. At the same time he was so principled that when he took out that ad, he knew it would hurt him. He also
                     hoped it would help him, but he also knew it would hurt him.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, let me go back to pick up on something that you mentioned a little bit ago. You were talking about the train trip, and
                     mentioned the fact that most of the nineteen were fairly well-off or even clearly wealthy. At the beginning, and I'm assuming
                     that this may have changed later, but at the outset, were you, the attorneys, paid directly by your clients? At what point
                     was there outside fund-raising begun to be done? I understand that that did happen, but I'm not clear on what point that might
                     have been.
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, we were paid. And it is the one time in my fifty plus years of practice that I can say that in a civil liberties, a civil
                     rights case, not only were we paid, but we were well paid. I think they, you know, it was— They wanted to pay a reasonable
                     fee. The money raising started after the firings, after the Waldorf declaration, the firings, and the contempt citation. You
                     said something about their being wealthy. There's a difference between making a lot of money and having a lot of money. And
                     I don't think any one of them was really a very wealthy person. I think they might have had reserves enough to last two or
                     three years, a couple of years, but they were—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And there were several of them that weren't wealthy at all and had not ever made a lot of money. Alvah Bessie was in the process
                     of trying to break into Hollywood. And he was— He had no money to speak of. Let's see who else. Sam [Samuel] Ornitz was a
                     man who only worked very occasionally in the industry and certainly was not anything more than modest middle class in his
                     income.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The ones that did very well were first of all Trumbo and Maltz; and then in
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">206</span> ―
                     </div>the second group, who didn't make quite as much as Trumbo and Maltz, but did very well, were Cole, Lardner; Scott and Dmytryk
                     were just coming up. They had just done a couple of things which had been very successful. And the road ahead looked very
                     rosy for them, but they were new. They certainly hadn't had any time to accumulate anything to speak of. And the things that
                     they had done while they were big successes had not made them a lot of money. See, who else can I think of? Herbert Biberman,
                     modestly well-off, he and Gale Sondergaard. She was working a great deal; he was getting some work as a director. He had been
                     a Broadway director. They certainly were comfortable.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But for some of them, it was like making maybe $2,500 a week versus $5,000, or on occasion $10,000 a week. You want to remember
                     these people didn't work all of the time either. But they did very well when they worked. Don't know whether I've covered
                     all of the ten.

                     to—his words and so forth, which are already in the public record. But did you anticipate the degree to which the committee
                     was going to refuse to allow him to speak? And did you have to do some strategizing on the spot, as it were?

                     assume that the worst case was what would happen, but we were prepared for it. Therefore, nothing that happened surprised
                     us in the sense that we had not anticipated it at least as a possibility.

                     happening. No matter how much you may have said we expect that this may happen. The ruthlessness of the committee. The total
                     willingness to just override every kind of a request that was made. For example, on the statements, every witness who was
                     a friendly witness was allowed to read the statement, was encouraged to read one. The turndown was just flat, flat turned
                     down.

                     </div>how it became obvious—was that the committee had <i>no</i> interest in doing anything more than establishing that these people were members of the Communist Party. They weren't concerned
                     about investigating what they did. They weren't concerned about the kind of pictures they made. In support of pictures— Some
                     of the statements, by the way, dealt with the ridiculous position that had been taken by some of the friendly witnesses that
                     they [the Hollywood Ten] were able to control the content of motion pictures, which of course they were not able to do. Except
                     in such insidious ways as, I think it was— Who was it? Adolphe Menjou or one of them said that they showed Russians smiling
                     and Russian children playing happily. That kind of propaganda they were able, I suppose, to get in, if you want to call it
                     that. But in any event, that was all they were interested in. And that became so clear and so blatant. There was a question
                     of—remember we discussed—how do you make that apparent? What do you do with that?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Also, we talked to some of the friends who were there, and while nobody started to turn around and run, we found that there
                     was some beginning of withdrawal—some. Some of the people were a little frightened by what they saw. And the criticism was
                     made of course: "You were impolite; you should have been polite—after all, it's our Congress. You shouldn't act that way.
                     You were rude."

                     It was sharply divided reaction, even among our friends.

                     with them. Talked to them. They said they were here to support. And within the first two or three days thereafter, they disappeared.
                     Well, if I say disappeared, they were going back to whatever they were doing, and they completely faded out of the picture

                     Many of them who hadn't really— Perhaps no deep understanding of what was going on, but came along: "Gee, you know, I've known
                     Dalton Trumbo for ten years. He's a great writer, and look what they're trying to do with him." Much of it on a very personal
                     level and also the concept, "Gee, the First Amendment." Everybody can support the First Amendment. And then you come there,

                     of the Supreme Court and had to resign from it. Extraordinarily good lawyer, considered one of the best minds in Washington.
                     I worked with him on drafting a complaint, although I did not represent the Screen Writers Guild. As a matter of fact, I don't

                     trial work at the early stages of that litigation. We won a couple of cases; lost one. They all went up on appeal. And then
                     about that time, the indictment was returned in the Smith Act case [<i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>] in Los Angeles, and I was called in on that. From that point on, for the next eighteen, twenty months did nothing else except
                     work on the Smith Act case. And Charles Katz— I think there was one other case tried by Katz and Kenny after I was already
                     in the Smith Act case. And they handled the appeals, which we lost— Some appeals which we lost, then others were settled.

                  <p class="noindent">There was a settlement, and I remember I participated in the discussions as to whether we should settle. It was finally decided
                     to settle. The cases that had not yet been decided in the appellate court would undoubtedly be lost, and we could get, I don't
                     know, we got a couple of hundred thousand dollars, I think. Something like that.

                  <p class="noindent">I've asked this question essentially before, but let me, in a different context, ask it again. When you returned from Washington,
                     of course, only ten of the nineteen, eleven counting Brecht, had been actually called to testify. And when the indictments
                     came down for contempt of Congress, as I understand it, the disassociation of the other nine was somewhat— Had it essentially
                     come before that? Did the nine feel that they were going to be— Were they still in touch with you, because there was a possibility
                     that they would be called again before the committee, or was it clear that they were not now going to be called? I'm being
                     clear at what I'm getting at?

                     hearings. As a matter of fact, it didn't hold further hearings for about three years, until the Supreme Court denied a hearing
                     in the contempt cases. So that it did not appear probable that there were going to be any further hearings until after the
                     contempt matters had been decided.

                  <p class="noindent">And people spread out. Some people went to Europe. I think a couple of people went to Mexico. I think a couple tried to make
                     peace. One of the persons involved was Robert Rossen. Why, I think it was later discovered that he had, as a matter of fact,
                     he'd gone and cooperated with the committee, although it wasn't generally known. So they kind of dispersed.

                  <p class="noindent">You want to remember there's another thing that is true. That the ones that they called first were, to use a word that is
                     used often, were the hard core. They were the ones who were the center of the left-wing movement. Jack Lawson probably at
                     the heart of it. Jack Lawson was the principal founder of the Writers Guild—organizer of it. So that when you got beyond these
                     people, you were dealing with people who were liberals and Left and some Communist Party members, but who had not been as
                     vigorous in their political activities as the first ten.

                     could comment on, in terms of your own recollections. One is that he recalls that those of the nineteen who were in fact members
                     of the Communist Party had separate meetings, or at least had one or two separate meetings, to discuss what they as Communist
                     Party members should do. That was [point] A. And secondly Maltz also recalls that the party really left the nineteen and then
                     later the ten to decide their own political strategy. It was not something that was essentially run or guided

                     and on their behalf, [I] simply reported what had happened, what they were going to do, and asked for support through the
                     papers—things of that kind. My recollection is that they pretty much simply said, "Well, we think you're doing right, and
                     we'll support you." The program— This I want to make clear. The decision was not— As to what they were going to do, [the decision]
                     was made by the witnesses themselves together with their attorneys. Now, of course their political affiliations indicated
                     what kind of people they were and pointed to the direction in which they would go. But no one, absolutely <i>no one</i> decided what they would do for them. Mainly, they went to try to get additional support in various ways from organizations.
                     So you want to remember that the Communist Party at that time had a great deal of influence in many organizations. And one
                     of the things that was hopeful to get— This broad organizational support was possible, and the party headquarters got out
                     the word this is a worthy cause and ought to be supported, it would have an impact. So that was the nature of our contact.

                     But there were— You want to remember these people were public figures. They spoke out on public issues, and their names were
                     known among the people. So when they spoke, their words were printed in the newspapers and in the press. They were important
                     voices.

                     Not very many. And these people were generous and did give to the party. So they were important to the party, but not from
                     the standpoint of controlling the content of motion pictures, nor was there ever even any idea that this could be done.

                     control of the content. They discussed such things, for example, as support of the trade unions, discrimination against blacks,
                     and so forth. Those they were concerned with. No one among them even dreamed that they controlled the content of a motion

                  <p class="noindent">Well, you have to go back. I left out one thing when I was talking about strategy and preparing for the hearings. We anticipated
                     that there would be contempt and a contempt trial probably, and we wanted to have something that we could take to a jury.
                     What we were afraid of is that you'd create a situation where what the judge would instruct the jury would virtually eliminate
                     any question of fact for the jury to decide.
                  </p>

                  <p class="noindent">So the ten, when I say, "They refuse to answer the question," they'd put it a different way; they said, "I am answering the
                     question, and this is the only, this is the only way the question can be answered." Wanting to leave open the possibility
                     of arguing to the jury that they should consider this in answer to the question.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Actually, when we got to trial, the judge [Edward M. Kern] instructed the jury that they must find that the questions were
                     not answered, as indeed they weren't. It was really a gimmick that we were trying somehow to get to the jury. There was nothing
                     for the jury to decide, in that we first of all prepared a motion to dismiss. It was really a legal issue. Did extensive research.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Argued in the trial court. Lost, of course, before every judge. Then when the case was tried, the trials were very short trials,
                     a couple of days, because no defense was really permitted. The case consisted primarily of the record of the committee, fact
                     that there had been the hearings, [and] the vote of Congress. That was basically the record. We looked for technical things—why
                     the committee was fully authorized and so forth. None of the technical things really had any merit.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What we had basically was a constitutional issue. They had—the government had done its work, so far as the technical handling
                     of the case was [concerned], and left us with nothing much there. We tried some things out. I don't remember what they were,
                     but they had very little hope of success—of possibility of success.

                  <p class="noindent">Then we tried the case. And the main issue, we always felt that we would lose in the trial court; we would lose in the court
                     of appeal; and we would win in the Supreme Court. Or at least that that's where we had a really fine chance of winning. We
                     certainly lost in the trial court; lost in the appellate court; and then were denied a hearing. Didn't even get a hearing
                     in the Supreme Court, on a

                  <p class="noindent">Now, as I understand it, shortly before the case referred your petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for hearing, there were
                     some changes in the composition of the court. Tom [C.] Clark, I believe, became a justice, and one other—

                  <p class="noindent">Well, what happened was, we lost— We felt we had at least four jus— In order to get a hearing in the Supreme Court, four justices
                     out of nine have to vote for the hearing. In order to win the case, you have to get a majority of those participating in the
                     decision. And we felt clearly that we had the four. Two of them, however, were [Frank] Murphy, former governor of Michigan,
                     and [Wiley B.] Rutledge, who had only been on the Supreme Court a short time but was really on his way to becoming one of
                     the great justices of the Supreme Court. He died. Both of them died.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The matter was kept under submission by the— Ordinarily whether or not a hearing is granted is decided within a matter of
                     weeks or months. It was kept under submission for over a year, and then they denied a hearing. But in the meantime these two
                     judges had died. So we knew we had two pretty sure votes left, and probably even a good chance of the third one. But it was
                     clear by that time that our chances of having four were very slim. So that's what happened. And basides that, the political
                     situation had become much worse. The Cold War was— See, it was denied—<i>Certiorari</i> was denied in '50. Well, by 1950, the Cold War was really rolling.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, there had been some very, very good First Amendment decisions, which had ruled that not only that the First Amendment
                     protected the right to speak, but the right of association. And that the right to associate was an essential element of the
                     right to speak. If you didn't have that right, the right to speak would be minimized and destroyed.

                     A person can voluntarily answer any question the person wants to answer, but you can't compel him to answer. And we wrote
                     a very, very strong brief on that, which later on was largely followed by the Supreme Court in the <i>Watkins</i> case [<i>Watkins</i> v. <i>United States</i>], which was decided in [pauses] 1956, or '57. Six or seven years— No. [Nineteen] fifty-six or '57, yeah, six or seven years

                     when Murphy died, and diminished even further when Rutledge died. And their replacements were terrible. I think the replacements
                     were Clark and [Harold H.] Burton, if I remember correctly. Terrible replacements because it meant not only good votes for

                     to duck it, duck the thing. It was just too basic, too important a question, the Supreme Court would not do that. We weren't
                     at that point nearly as confident about winning the case as we had been earlier. But it turned out that they solved the problem
                     by ducking it.

                     problems. Whereas we had gotten well paid initially, there came a point when we contined to work without any pay for years.
                     So that when it added up, the pay wasn't so good. But, so there was that financial consideration from the standpoint of the
                     ten themselves, as well as from the standpoint of the attorney. You know, just paying the expenses of attorneys from California
                     and the witnesses in California to go [and] the defendants to go was by then a lot of money for them to raise.

                  <p class="noindent">So that was the second reason. And the third was that the people were then blacklisted. Remember at this stage when that decision
                     was made, we were very optimistic that we could go right up and win that case. And if we won that case, then we felt the [fight
                     against the] blacklist would be helped. So this was a way of speeding it up. Very concerned. So for those three reasons, this
                     decision was arrived at. And I can't— There may have been some people who originally questioned it, but when the whole thing
                     was explained, I can't remember any dissent.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, we spent quite a bit of time talking about the Hollywood Ten. There's a few more things I'd like to ask you on that subject
                     before we go on to other things. First of all, we may have talked about this a little bit before, but in the [1948] contempt-of-Congress
                     trials of John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo [<i>Lawson</i> v. <i>United States, Trumbo</i> v. <i>United States</i>], I wonder if you could give me some of your recollections about how those trials went, some of the problems that came out
                     during those trials, and some of your strategizing beforehand on how you were going to handle those defenses.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Our main problem was that we wanted to try the cases, we tried two of them, in such a way that the jury would have a basis—under
                     the instructions of the court and the facts that were presented—on which it could acquit, because most of the facts were totally
                     undisputed. For example, the fact that they had been properly subpoenaed, the fact that the committee [House Committee to
                     Investigate Un-American Activities (HUAC)] was properly appointed, the fact that there had been summons or subpoenas had been
                     served, the fact that they were asked questions and what their answers [were]. There were simply no issues really to be decided
                     there. And it appeared that once you put in all of those facts, a conviction would automatically follow, because the questions
                     that were asked about membership in the Communist Party and in the Screen Actors—Scrren Writers or Screen Actors Guild were
                     never answered.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We tried to develop a gimmick, which was to the effect that when the witnesses responded—the ones we represented—they did
                     not refuse to answer. They answered by saying that under the Constitution they were not obligated to
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">223</span> ―
                     </div>answer and that this was the only kind of an answer that was required. Or that at least if it wasn't the only kind of an answer
                     that was required, at the very least the jury had a right to find, as a matter of fact, that it was an adequate answer. We
                     tried that as a practical matter: it didn't work. The reason it didn't work is that the judge [Edward M. Kern] gave instructions
                     to the effect that the only issue was whether or not there had been a deliberate failure to answer the question directly,
                     responsibely. And that an answer which explained the reason for not answering responsibly was not a defense.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We also tried to put in evidence about the history of the committee to show that it had no valid constitutional basis for
                     existing. The trial judge held on that, and I think correctly, as a matter of law that that was an issue for the court to
                     decide. It was a constitutional issue of the kind that should not go to a jury. It was a question of law, not of fact. And
                     that all of the matters on which we relied were of the kind of which the court could take judicial notice. So we fought these
                     things out and tried to make a record on the case. But when the jury was instructed as a practical matter, the only way that
                     the jury could acquit was by going contrary to the instructions of the judge. The judge— They left absolutely no opening.
                     I must confess that the thing that we tried to do, so far as creating an issue of fact was concerned, was a pretty gimmicky
                     kind of thing where we just tried to do anything that we could.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In fact, when we went up on appeal, we didn't even argue directly that questions had been answered and that should have been
                     so held. We argued on appeal that under the Constitution, there was no obligation to answer those questions, because the committee,
                     for a large number of reasons, had no right to compel answers to the questions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, those things were questions of law and were not questions to be submitted to the jury. So we spent a lot of time trying
                     to work out something.

                     </div>But the way the cases were tried and the way it eventually resolved itself, the jury did convict. And as a matter of fact
                     they had no choice.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, your attempts to broaden the issues that the judge would allow the jury to consider and also to broaden what instructions
                     he would give—did those attempts take place primarily in pretrial motions, or was there a lot of arguing during the trial
                     out of the presence of the jury? What form did that take?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I would say that the major arguments were made in pretrial motions, which we lost. Then during the trial, for the most
                     part, we raised the same points that we'd already lost in pretrial motions. There [were] not very extensive arguments. I think
                     the cases— There were two cases tried: the <i>Lawson</i> case, and the <i>Trumbo</i> case. And I think each of them from the time of the impaneling of the jury through the jury verdicts took two days.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, you mentioned some of the gimmicks that you tried to use. One, in the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> April 16, 1948, during the Lawson trial— The article mentions that you were denied permission to show a film that Mr. Lawson
                     had been involved in writing. Apparently, according to the article, as an attempt to show that subversive ideas had not been
                     injected into the film and so on. The article doesn't mention what film it was. Do you remember that episode?

                  <p class="noindent">I think the film that we tried to show was <i>Blockade.</i> A film that Lawson wrote and was a big hit during the war—a war film.

                  <p class="noindent">We had decided in advance that, as a practical matter, the case was going to be decided on appeal, and, probably, in all probability,
                     by the Supreme Court of the United States. And in any event, it was not going to be decided by the— On the issues that we

                     a group of people who just simply defied all public authority. We didn't think that was a good climate in which to present
                     the case. And the other was that even if we had been able to present all of the evidence we wanted to present, we did not
                     have the kind of a jury that would be very likely to acquit under any circumstances. In the city of Washington, it was impossible
                     to get a jury the great majority of whom were not either themselves in the government employ or didn't have a member of their
                     family, or very close friend, that was in the government employ. That's what Washington is. Basically, it's a legislative
                     and executive governmental city. We, as a matter of fact, had advanced the contention that government employees could not
                     sit on this, because this was the government against these defendants, and in effect they had to be prejudiced. That argument
                     in that form alone is really not a valid argument, because it could be made in every criminal case. It's the people versus

                  <p class="noindent">We had very little hope of winning the case in the court of appeals. They had a very conservative court of appeals. It required
                     the making of new laws; courts of appeals do that far less frequently than the Supreme Court does. That's more or less the
                     Supreme Court's business.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We had a great deal of hope. As a matter of fact, we felt that certainly we were going to get a hearing and that the odds
                     were very good that we would have at least five of the nine justices in our favor. But this is the hope that we had at the
                     time that the petition for a hearing was filed in the Supreme Court. Then, I don't remember the order in which it happened,
                     but either first Justice [Wiley B.] Rutledge died, or Justice [Frank] Murphy died. And whoever died first, we still felt at
                     that time that we would get a hearing at least. Because we felt that we had four justices who would probably vote for a hearing,
                     based upon their record and their position. Then when the second justice died, which was

                     </div>either—which was the other one—Rutledge or Murphy, our hopes went down a long way. Because at that time we realized that we
                     had only three justices on whom we felt we could really depend. Now, that was one factor that decreased our expectations as
                     time went on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But there was another factor that was equally instrumental in our hopes going down. And that is, that when we started the
                     case— While we were already in a period of Cold War and red-baiting, the Cold War was every day becoming colder and McCarthyism
                     was every day becoming hotter. Fear was spreading; was on a rampage through our society. So that by the time the Supreme Court
                     denied the hearing, the political situation was, as a whole, very much against our getting a hearing. We were realistic about
                     the fact that political situations affect even the best of Supreme Court justices.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. Now, when the Supreme Court did deny hearing, do you recall, well, do you recall where you were in the reaction of you
                     and the other attorneys and the ten? I mean at this point everybody knows you're going to jail, and the only question is how
                     long. Do you remember anything about having to share that knowledge with the rest of the ten?

                  <p class="noindent">I don't remember where I was. I'm almost positive that I got a call from the clerk of the Supreme Court—they very commonly
                     call you—and followed up by a notice that I talked the other lawyers into— We split up contacting our clients.

                  <p class="noindent">As I said, by the time this happened, you see, there was another very peculiar thing in this case. And that is, usually, when
                     you file a petition for CERT [<i>certiorari</i>], while there is no deadline created by law on the Supreme Court ruling on whether it will grant a hearing, theoretically
                     they could sit on it for five years, and then either grant or deny a hearing. Customarily, action was taken within a matter
                     of weeks. There might be an exception where it took a

                     the end of a term, they will decide all of the petitions that had been filed during that term, other than perhaps some that
                     might have been filed the last few days and they didn't have an opportunity to reach. We had filed before the beginning of
                     the term, and here the term ended, and they didn't act on it. They decided it, as I remember, fairly early in the following
                     term.

                  <p class="noindent">From the Court's standpoint, I think they wanted a full court to pass on it. I don't remember how long it took to fill the
                     vacancies that were created by the deaths of Murphy and Rutledge. So to some extent it was understandable that they would
                     delay. But there was another reason also for our having lost our high optimism. And that is, we knew before the appointments
                     were made that they would be very conservative. And, indeed, they turned out to be. We knew what had happened is that we had
                     lost two of the strongest advocates for our position, and had them replaced by people who would fight strongly against our
                     position—pretty high hurdle to overcome. Now, the way this ties into the whole thing is that by the time it happened, we were
                     still somewhat hopeful of a hearing. But we expected anything to happen, and it came as no great surprise. It came as a shock,
                     but no great surprise. Now, maybe that sounds inconsistent—

                     with each one. Like I can imagine, I don't remember if I talked to Trumbo, for example, I can imagine

                     sort of half crying about this, "My god, what's going to happen to us?" With all sorts of reactions in between. Most of the
                     reactions I think were strong: we-have-just-begun-to-fight type of reactions.

                     were going to exhaust every, every possibility, and we did. And there we had— We filed it, more because we felt that we couldn't
                     have anybody say that we had failed to do everything possible, rather than any belief in the possibility that such a petition
                     would be granted. And then following that, that was denied quite promptly. I imagine it took a month, six weeks—the whole
                     thing. We then made arrangements to surrender the people in Washington and for them to travel there on their own. Although
                     I'm trying to think, now, I may be wrong about that. I think that they came and picked up some of the defendants in California
                     and took them in custody to Washington.

                     were hard hit by the blacklist, etcetera, they were able to write on the black market. Most of them continued to make some
                     kind of a living on a much lesser scale. Much, much lesser scale than before, but, nevertheless, were able, most of them,
                     to survive economically. Eddie is a director. And a director, you can't operate in the black market as a director, so that
                     he saw his whole career just terminate forever. Whereas at least the others, or most of the others, felt that one way or another

                  <p class="noindent">You see, one of the things that happened is that many of the writers—the good, the best writers—made a comeback later on,
                     and then did all right. That did not happen for the most part to the actors and actresses. The reason is that after being

                     of them in jail; they were too far away. But the people in the East and the other people did visit them. They were not discriminated
                     against in jail. They all functioned within the prison system very well; that is, they were able to survive, and they had
                     no problems with fellow prisoners. As a matter of fact, many of the other prisoners liked to hear them talk and saw them as
                     personalities, as heroes, or at least big public figures, for having prestige. So, while prison of course is prison, it wasn't
                     certainly any worse for them than it was for others. By and large, while they were sent to different institutions—and some
                     of them were tougher than others, but that was the nature of the institution—for the most part, they were sent to the easier
                     institutions. None of them were sent to the real harsh ones.

                     that to some extent. The name Martin Gang—who is of course very well known as an attorney who helped people to avoid the blacklist,
                     or to at least deal with it in one way or another—has come up before in our discussions. I wanted to ask you a few things
                     about him. Not only your general recollections of him, but also whether it ever happened that people would go to you first
                     and then go to him, or go to him first and then come to you. I know that you defended a lot of people who were before HUAC,
                     or who were subject to the blacklist. What do you recall about the whole Martin Gang phenomenon and the blacklist as it related
                     to him?

                  <p class="noindent">There would be no person who would come to me and then go to Martin Gang, unless they completely changed their attitude between
                     the time that they came to me and the time that they finally went to Gang. Now, there may have been a few people that came
                     to me and ultimately went to Gang.

                  <p class="noindent">Not everybody resisted to the same extent. There were some people who folded over a period of time. For example, [Larry] Parks,
                     I think, went to Gang;

                     </div>I'm almost positive he went to Gang. But he didn't come to me after it was over. He was an actor, you see. Again, he had a
                     more difficult role. For him, it was particularly difficult. He had had his one big success, <i>The Jolson Story,</i> and it looked like his career was just beginning. He was going to be a terrific star versus nothing. There was no black market
                     for him. He was married to a wonderful woman, Betty, oh, I can't— It'll come to me [Betty Garrett]. An actress who was very
                     good politically, but who stayed with him when he turned—

                  <p class="noindent">So I would say that people who had one political attitude went to me—and others, not only to me—and people who had an entirely
                     different political attitude, or at least if not an entirely different political attitude, were ready to submerge their political
                     views and to go contrary to them, went to Martin Gang.

                  <p class="noindent">He tried to be friendly with me. I remember his coming up and talking to me and saying, "You know, Ben, we're both trying
                     to do the same thing." My reaction as I remember, I said, "Martin," something along the lines of "Martin, you've got too much
                     brains to really believe that," and walked away.

                  <p class="noindent">But he always wanted to be on the side of the angels and to have himself treated as though he were. But actually what he was
                     doing is he was saying to people, "I can arrange, if you completely fold and do everything the committee wants, I can arrange
                     for you perhaps to get some work." That's what he was doing.

                     example of it. There were a few celebrated cases where people got double-crossed later, and their testimony became public.

                     objectives, by doing that. And the other was that there were many people who were sort of "graylisted," which was very close,
                     sometimes equal, to a blacklist, but who really had never been— There was no claim that they had ever been members of the
                     Communist Party, but they had been close friends with people who had been in the Communist Party. Gone to affairs with them,
                     belonged to the antifascist refugee committee, had signed various petitions, and so forth. But who could sign affidavits truthfully
                     saying, "I'm not now, I never have been a member of the Communist Party." And then they would have to sign statements saying,
                     "But I was a stooge and they fooled me. Got me to join the antifascist refugee committee or to sign a petition for peace,"
                     or whatever. And some of those I think they did not disclose.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, earlier in this oral history the name Roy [M.] Brewer came up in connection with the Warner Brothers strike and a lot
                     of things that were going on in the studios in the thirties. And we deferred a story concerning Roy Brewer and the film <i>Salt of the Earth</i> that you wanted to tell, which I think would be a good time to get into that. I know that in the early fifties some of the
                     blacklisted writers and directors—people like Paul Jarrico, Herbert Biberman, Michael Wilson—began working on independent
                     film projects, and <i>Salt of the Earth</i> was one of them. What do you recall about the events around <i>Salt of the Earth?</i></p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I know that the three people that you have mentioned— Two of them are dead now, by the way. Herb Biberman and Mike Wilson
                     are both dead. Paul Jarrico lives in Los Angeles. The three of them got together, and I had some meetings with them. I don't
                     remember whether business or social. But at any rate, they were trying to develop the concept that the blacklisted people
                     ought to be able to do independent motion pictures. They had the talent [and] knowledge of every kind.

                  <p class="noindent">About that time, there was a strike of miners in Silver City, New Mexico, which got a great deal of publicity, primarily because
                     after an injunction was issued against any picketing by the men, the women took over the picket line. It was a very effective
                     means of continuing the strike, which ultimately was won. It was decided that this would afford an excellent basis for a script.
                     And Mike Wilson, who, I think, is one of the two or three finest screenwriters in the history of the industry, went to Silver
                     City and lived there for about, as I remember, two or three months. Got to know the people and so forth and wrote a screenplay

                     </div>that was an absolutely beautiful, magnificent screenplay.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I became involved at that point, perhaps a little earlier, because they wanted to go ahead with the motion picture, with Mike
                     Wilson as the writer of the screenplay, Herbert Biberman as the director, and Paul Jarrico as the producer. The problem, of
                     course, was money. I had at that time a very close personal friend and client by the name of Lazarus, Simon Lazarus, who was
                     quite a wealthy man and who had himself taken the Fifth Amendment before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He
                     had operated some theaters and shown things that brought him into disrepute, so to speak, of a political nature. I got together
                     with him and some other people. With him sort of— The reason I mention him is because he was kind of a key figure in this
                     thing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They'd prepared a budget, which, as I recall, was in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars. This was on the basis
                     of everybody participating on a minimum. They wanted to do it as a union picture, but everybody participating on the basis
                     of the minimum scale, regardless of what they were worth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Also, they had the concept of using the miners themselves as characters in the play. And as a matter of fact, the president
                     of the union [Juan Chacon] became one of the key principals. They couldn't find a woman who they thought could carry the female
                     lead. They finally lined up a fine actress from Mexico, who obtained a permit to come into the country to make the picture.

                     brothers and she made up the fifth. Every one of them became a famous figure on the Mexican cultural level. The father of
                     this family had been a miner in Mexico. Had moved his family to Mexico City, and had operated a stall in one of these open-air
                     markets. I don't know if you've been in Mexico City or not.

                     was the leading actress and one of the leading dancers in Mexico; a brother, who was with the famous painters of that time,

                  <p class="noindent">Diego Rivera and others. By the way, through them I had an opportunity to meet and spend some time with Rivera, quite a remarkable
                     man. But that one died; was the youngest one to die. He died of alcoholism, I think, at the age of thirty-five, or something
                     like that. Relatively young man, but he had already achieved fame as one of— On an equal status up to that point with Rivera,
                     of course, who went on for many years. One was a leading novelist. Another was a leading musician, recognized as such, and
                     a leading poet. There were five of them. Each one of them was a nationally renowned figure in Mexico, coming out of this poor
                     family. Anyway, Rosaura Revueltas was having great difficulty getting—she was a fine actress—getting work in Mexico, because
                     the kind of films they made there were generally trash. So they were able to line her up.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">My part I played initially was in helping in setting up a corporation and helping to arrange the money for the budget, a lot
                     of fairs and fund-raising. I
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">242</span> ―
                     </div>think we raised the amount of the original budget by way of it as an investment. Of course, no one ever got their money back,
                     but it was originally an investment. It was hoped at that time that people actually would make money out of it, although the
                     people that put money in it knew the risk that they were taking.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Anyway, the picture was shot in [Silver] City [New Mexico], using, as the leads, Rosaura Revueltas and the president of the
                     union there. They had the whole union as their extras for their scenes. They used several of the women and several of the
                     men in important subsidiary roles, also. But also they had a number of American actors who went down there, who were very
                     good, very fine actors. Anyway, the picture—they went there and shot it in Silver City on location—I think stayed very close
                     to being within budget. For a long time, they had no problems in shooting the picture. They'd gone down there; they'd established
                     themselves in the community. And then they started—the redbaiting started.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Someone made a speech in Congress—I can't remember who it was [Representative Donald Jackson of California]—about the picture:
                     that the red forces were using these workers to prepare a communist film. And Howard Hughes, at that time was in the industry,
                     issued a statement, saying that they would never be allowed to complete that film.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The picture, as far as the shooting was concerned, was within two or three weeks of completion when Rosaura Revueltas was
                     picked up to be deported. And they had worked out a theory. When you come in (she'd come in on a bus; she had a visa) you're
                     supposed to have your visa stamped. But lots of times, particularly— People in a car generally get it done. On a bus they
                     sometimes just wait on the bus seats, look at the visas, [and] don't stamp them all. And she had not had her visa stamped.
                     Technically, it was supposed to be stamped when she came in, but that was just a procedural requirement. No question

                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">243</span> ―
                     </div>that she came in legally, except that they said she couldn't come in legally without having her visa stamped, you know. They
                     took her to—gee, was it Dallas? Where did they take her? I think it was Dallas; I'm not sure [El Paso]. I went there and filed
                     a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to get her released. I was there for several weeks, and we never got a hearing. They kept stalling us. The judges just kept
                     putting it over. Well, I say, we had some partial hearings. Then the government said it needed more time, more evidence.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In the meantime, what happened was that the community around Silver City was being agitated. One day, a vigilante group was
                     formed to drive the people out of the picture—out of Silver City.

                  <p class="noindent">Did the crew continue to film other scenes while she was in jail?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Oh, yes. There were other scenes that could be filmed without her, although she was needed for a few scenes to complete the
                     picture. So they went on. They were shooting these other things.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">When this vigilante group developed, they decided to pull up stakes and to leave. They were very, very close to completion
                     on everything, except Rosaura's [scenes]. And I couldn't tell them when we would get a court order on Rosaura, 'cause it was
                     obvious they were playing games with us. They really in my opinion— Well, the case was just a made-up case. It was just one
                     of those technical things that had no substance to it. So when they pulled up stakes, I arranged for her voluntary departure.
                     There was no longer any purpose in continuing to fight this thing out. They could have continued it for months.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We anyway had plans to shoot the final scenes in Mexico City, which was done. She went back to Mexico. We arranged for her
                     release, and [she] got back to Mexico. Some of the final scenes were shot in Mexico City. A lot of technical problems because
                     of location and so forth, and there were some

                     close to two years to get the work completed. What they would do is they would sneak it in, under a portion of film under
                     some other name, into a lab. And all over the country: some of them in New York, some of them in Chicago, some in Los Angeles,

                     was greater than the original amount of the cost of shooting the film. But with all its side trips, it was finally completed.
                     Herb Biberman has written a book dealing with the specifics of the problem.

                  <p class="noindent">And Brewer, we get back to Brewer. Brewer was the local—was the Hollywood representative of the IATSE, the International Alliance
                     of Theatrical Stage Employees. They represented and controlled the workers in all of the film labs, which were almost a hundred
                     percent unionized. And he was the one that gave instructions, or had the international give instructions through him, that
                     union members were not to work on <i>Salt of the Earth.</i></p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As soon as it was discovered— Now, there were many people who were sympathetic. And there were some labs who did as much as
                     they could, knowing what they were doing, but feeling that they could say, "We didn't know about this, or we would never have
                     done it." The workers in some instances knew. "And what was that?"

                  <p class="noindent">By the way, the film is since recognized as a classic. It has more 16-mm distribution than virtually any other full-length
                     motion picture. And it developed it would— The film historically was completed. It related the union struggle and the struggle
                     of women for their position in society. Beautiful, beautiful thing.

                  <p class="noindent">So the next thing was [to] get a distributor. Nobody would distribute, so we had to do it ourselves. We opened in New York
                     at a theater way out somewhere. In order to get the theater, we had to pay about ten times what the ordinary rental was for
                     the theater. It ran there for a few weeks, and we were losing money on the thing, even though the attendance was very good.
                     And then we had to get a theater in Los Angeles. We finally got a theater on Hollywood Boulevard that had been closed. It
                     wasn't functioning as a theater, but it was a fully equipped theater.

                     named Howard Hughes as a defendant, but we could never get him served. We could never even find out what his address was,
                     what his residence was. You could serve by publication under California law, but you had to have an affidavit as to what his
                     permanent place of residence was and that you'd attempted to serve it. He didn't have a permanent place. [laughs] He used
                     to stay around, you know, and literally— Not only did we have that problem. There were lots of actions filed against him;

                     the original film, and we said the film will be made for this, and then we had to raise almost twice as much again in order

                     the film just became what you normally call an "underground classic," or something like that. It's been shown at political
                     events for decades and so on.

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah. We got distributors who distribute the 16-mm and 8-mm films. It started doing very well from day one in that area. But
                     you were talking about royalties of $15,000 a year, $20,000 a year, which is a lot of money for, you know— That's not the
                     rentals, that was the royalties that were received. And that money, with the consent of the investors, went to Wilson, Biberman,
                     and Jarrico over the years. I imagine over the years they have gotten a substantial amount of money. But all three of them
                     not only gave three or four total years of their life to this, maybe five, but threw their own money into it. Spent their
                     own time and money in it. So what they've gotten out of it is little enough. But it's now permanent; it brings in money every
                     year, just automatically.

                     </div>He was a very close personal friend of Charles Chaplin. As a matter of fact, the only time I ever met Chaplin was one afternoon
                     at the beach, when Hanns took Valerie and me out to the place where Chaplin was staying. (The beach site itself is an interesting
                     story.)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But in any event, Hanns Eisler— As I remember it, my memory isn't entirely clear on this, but they started deportation proceedings
                     on the ground that he had misrepresented when he entered the country: that he had not disclosed his political affiliation.
                     We fought it, although Hanns, like his brother was, no question about it, an official of a communist party. Hanns had been,
                     I believe, in the Communist Party, but had dropped out, although there was no question where his sympathies and his political
                     beliefs were. Anyway, we fought for some time. My best recollection is that rather than take and have him deported as he would
                     have been, we took voluntary departure at a point.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Hanns had played it very carefully all the time that he had been here, as far as any public activities are concerned. All
                     he was doing was writing music. He wasn't even writing screenplays, or anything like that. He could have had a lot of work
                     here as a musician, because he was very good. However, if I say he was very careful, he was not careful as to the company
                     he kept. He moved in left-wing circles. He was a good friend of Dalton, and other people of that kind.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And, as I say, also a good friend of Chaplin, however, who, when he [Eisler] needed— One of the things I discovered about
                     Chaplin is that while— Aside from any other strange characteristics, this very, very, very rich man—and I mean he was <i>very</i> rich—was very tight with the bucks. And Hanns Eisler was a very, very close friend of Chaplin. Politically, they saw things
                     very much alike, although Chaplin was much more eccentric than Hanns. Hanns was a much steadier, stable kind of a man.

                     They were required at that time— He got a visa. He said he was not a communist when he got that visa. The government had great
                     difficulty proving that he was a communist at the time. As a matter of fact, I believe he was not at the time that he said
                     that. I think it was a truthful statement. But the government did have evidence, as I remember it, of his activities in relation
                     to the Communist Party [of Germany] prior to that time, or there were articles about his attending meetings.

                     Federation of Labor], involving unemployment insurance. The principal case was <i>Abelleira</i> v.

                     </div><i>District Court of Appeal,</i> decided by the supreme court of the state of California on February 7, 1941. What had happened was that there had been a
                     strike of longshoremen. There was a question as to whether under the circumstances of this strike— Well, no, no. There had
                     been a labor dispute. The law read at that time—and I think still reads—that people who leave their work because of a labor
                     dispute are disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance. We somehow got a holding that these men had not left their
                     work because of a labor dispute, I don't remember just how we got that. That was not the real issue of this case; we really
                     reached for one on that one.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The question was whether they were entitled to receive their unemployment insurance benefits where you got a favourable ruling
                     pending the appeal and until that ruling was reversed. And the supreme court of the state held that they got that. Actually,
                     it lead— The law later developed that the original ruling would no longer be sustained.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But the importance of this decision was that if you could get a favorable decision, and it usually takes months and sometimes
                     years to get it reversed, you got your unemployment insurance in the meantime, which was a very, very important point. That
                     was what that case decided.

                     worked previously?

                     to interpret it. That was the first [California] Supreme Court interpretation of that clause.

                     material, I came across some sort of hints about, after the Hollywood Ten had gone to jail, some attempts to try to get them
                     out on parole before their sentences were completed. Is that correct? Were there some attempts to convince the parole board
                     to parole them? What do you recall about those efforts?

                  <p class="noindent">All that I can remember is that we wrote letters. First of all, two of the ten had only six-month sentences. And on sentences
                     of that length, there is no parole. I think there was even a question about whether you had to have a year and a day in order
                     to be eligible for parole. In any event, there was some technical question raised as to whether they were eligible. We wrote
                     some letters, did some research. I think there was a real problem about applying parole where there's only a one-year sentence.
                     In any event, the attempts were made, even though they were long shots and resulted in nothing. Each of them served their
                     full sentences with time off for good behavior.

                     with the story. There was no question that the contracts had been terminated before their expiration, and that the persons

                     clause which was a standard clause in all Hollywood contracts. And which historically arose out of the Fatty Arbuckle incident
                     when, I believe, Arbuckle was charged with murder of some woman with whom he had sexual relations. I'm not even—

                  <p class="noindent">An underage girl? In any event, it was a very serious thing. He had a contract with some of the studios, and people were blacklisting
                     his pictures because [of] the morals charge.

                  <p class="noindent">So it became [a] standard clause that there was a right to— The persons during the life of the contract would act as persons
                     of good moral character. And the defense, in the contract cases, was that by refusing to answer the

                     </div>questions [and] by being convicted for contempt of Congress that that made them persons of bad moral character. We convinced
                     the jury that that was not so—with two juries that that was not so, and won damages on the contract.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The studios appealed to the Ninth Circuit. These were federal cases. They appealed to the [United States] Ninth Circuit Court
                     of Appeals. I didn't have much to do with the appeals, because it was about that time that I became involved full-time in
                     the Smith Act case. The appeals were handled primarily by Charles Katz and Bob Kenny.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The Ninth Circuit reversed and held that as a matter of law, I believe they said, the refusal to answer questions and contempt
                     of Congress made them persons of bad moral character, something that I'm sure would not have been held in any other political
                     time. Because what the clause was really aimed at was not political activity, but morals in the sense of the Fatty Arbuckle
                     case. I suppose it might apply to such things as use of drugs and sexual promiscuity—things of that kind. But, in any event,
                     that was held, and we had several other cases pending.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And then in order to get rid of the litigation, the studio settled all of the cases with us, all of the pending cases, including
                     the ones that had been reversed. And I think—I don't remember the amount they paid, but I think it was something like $200,000
                     that they paid to settle all the cases, which is a fraction of what the people were entitled to if the contracts had been
                     enforced. And then this was divided on some sort of a pro rata basis among all of the—well, among nine of the ten.

                     Party, etcetera. Went whole hog, and immediately got contracts as a producer in the industry. And, I believe, has been in
                     the industry ever since, maybe right up to the present time. However, he had been unusually successful, I'd say. He was a
                     young man. He had been unusually successful and was supposed to have had a really important career ahead of him. The fact
                     of the matter is that I don't believe he ever made an important picture after that, and never became the kind of success that
                     was contemplated. He worked together with Adrian Scott, and they did particularly—What was the picture that dealt with anti-Semitism,

                     Of course, he did not have that collaboration afterwards. Also, he and Adrian had done things that they really believed in.
                     That they were totally committed to, not only as artists in the industry, but philosophically. It was something that— It was
                     just not another job for them, just not another way of making money. I don't think he ever again dared to do a picture with
                     a progressive theme. I really can't tell you whether those were the things or whatever it was. Or was simply the fact that
                     once a person does something like this, he isn't the same person again. But as I say, I'm not an expert, and I don't know.

                     New York or from New York to Los Angeles; I don't remember which way the trip was. I was traveling alone. I had dinner one
                     night and went into the parlor car to have a drink and relax for a while. And there was Edward Dmytryk with a group of four
                     or five other people. As he saw me come in, he stood up and stretched out his hand, and started to walk towards me. I walked
                     right past him and went on out of the car. I didn't sit down. It's the only time that I have seen him since that time. Another
                     one of the original nineteen who became a witness and an informer was the actor who had had one successful thing. He had done

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, I want to correct what I just said about representing Larry Parks later on. I did represent a great many blacklisted
                     people—Hollywood people as well as non-Hollywood people—perhaps several hundred before the committee over the next several
                     years. I now believe that I confuse Larry Parks with someone whose name I can't recall, but who looked very much like Larry
                     Parks.

                  <p class="noindent">The thing that brought it to mind is that Larry Parks was a very insecure person. He had had this one big success. He saw
                     the world opening up for him, and the world tumbled around his ears when this thing happened. Then he was blacklisted. He
                     saw no future, and he tried to save his career by voluntarily testifying. I think he went to Martin Gang, if I remember correctly,
                     who arranged for him to testify. But he would never—as far as I know, never got any work despite that, never got any work
                     in the Hollywood industry.

                  <p class="noindent">Did he, when he was first called back or when the committee was making it clear that they wanted him to come back, did he
                     talk to you at all, first, before he finally made his arrangements to give private testimony?

                     was, I believe, a young writer. And he went, and I can't remember his name, and he went with a group of very important writers.
                     You see, Michael Wilson was a very important writer. Paul Jarrico was important in the industry, and there were a number of
                     others. I get mixed up, the ones who were on which trip.

                  <p class="noindent">But in any event, he was in a group of fairly distinguished Hollywood people. He was a sort of— How he got included in the
                     group just didn't add up.

                     of their views and what they thought of the committee. He was very frightened before this happened. By god, he got on that
                     stand, and he was excellent.

                  <p class="noindent">All of his fears seemed to vanish, and he just did a— He stood up comparably with the others, whom he so much admired and
                     looked up to. I remember he was so elated. All of us were going for some reason from Washington to New York by train. There
                     was something, I think, we were all going to attend a meeting, and some were going to speak at the meeting. We were going
                     down to the railway station in Washington, D.C. There were a lot of pillars and posts, and he was walking jauntily along.
                     And all of a sudden—he was <i>so</i> out of it—he ran squarely into a post, [laughs] not observing where he was going. It struck me 'cause it is the only time
                     that I can remember of a person being quite as elated as he was immediately following an experience before the committee.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But Larry, unfortunately, was a person who just didn't have a lot of strength. I saw a lot of him in preparation for the hearings.
                     You see, he was with the nineteen. He just—they just didn't reach him. He was one of the people who at meetings kept constantly
                     saying, "I'm ready to stand by everybody else, but I want it guaranteed that everybody else is going to stand by me." It wasn't
                     just a question of stating a principle. It was a question of fear that was being expressed repeatedly over and over again,
                     until some of the people got a little angry at him because of his constant repetition of this concern.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">All right, now going on with the fight against the blacklist. You know that quite a few of the writers were able to get black
                     market jobs. Wrote screenplays for which they were paid on the average, I would say, somewhere between 10 and 25 percent of
                     their regular salaries. And I helped some of

                  <p class="noindent">The way it was done was that someone who was not blacklisted would present the material either as his own or sometimes under
                     a fictitious name, such as Dalton Trumbo's, Robert Rich, who wrote as Robert Rich in <i>The Brave One</i> [1957], for which he won an Academy Award. I helped him on his legal problems. I don't think, even at this stage, that I
                     want to mention the names of the people that were involved, because I don't know, even today, whether they would want it known.
                     But people who got work were Jack [John Howard] Lawson, Dalton, Mike Wilson. [Lester] Cole got some work, not very much. Anyway,
                     quite a few of the writers did get work, but they had to change their whole standard of living. Several of them went abroad.
                     Others went to Mexico. For example, Dalton and Albert Maltz. Albert got quite a lot of blacklisted black market work. He wrote
                     a screenplay, I think it was called <i>The Robe,</i> which I think was nominated for an Academy Award. I don't think it won.

                  <p class="noindent">Albert Maltz and Dalton Trumbo both lived in Mexico for several years, but eventually came back. They went to Mexico, because
                     they thought it might be easier to get black market work there, not only for the United States, but for other places in the
                     world. Also, the cost of living was so much lower, and they could come closer to maintaining the kind of standards they'd
                     had in the past, with their reduced income. However, they were never very happy in Mexico. It was a practical matter. Were
                     kept out of all political activity, and they lost their base. They lost their roots. Nevertheless they stayed there for several

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, something—it has the word <i>Glory</i> in it; I know that. Now, we met from time to time—various groups met—and discussed the fight against the blacklist. There
                     was broad disagreement as to how the matter would be accomplished—of breaking the blacklist.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I would say that there were really two groups. One group wanted to use legal means—every possible means, legal means and every
                     other means. And I would say that there were quite a number of people in that group, among whom was Mike Wilson. The other
                     group—one group, was Dalton's—felt that they could do it by gradually working within the industry and finally bringing about
                     the time when the industry would voluntarily break the blacklist.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I represented the group who felt that legal methods should also be used. We filed an action in the state court called <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Loew's.</i> That action was on the theory that there was an illegal conspiracy to deprive the people of the right to work, and arguing
                     that was a constitutionally protected right. We lost in the state courts, which held that that complaint did not state a cause
                     of action. Then, when we appealed and lost all the way up in the state court, I filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the United States Supreme Court, on the theory that the state, by refusing to hear the matter, had denied due process
                     to our people. To everyone's amazement, including to a considerable extent my own, the Supreme Court granted a hearing. In
                     the meantime, the group led by Dalton Trumbo had refused—not only had refused to support the litigation, but it actually opposed
                     it. It said that it ought to be dropped. That they were making

                     attorney from the East Coast who was in the McCarthy hearings, who did such a job on [Joseph R.] McCarthy in the army hearings.

                     have opened up a whole new area of constitutional law that had never been opened to that date. That was the main thing that
                     I had argued in my brief, and, as I say, we were suprised to get a hearing. But it was a, I think, a six-to-three opinion
                     with, or six-to-two, [William O.] Douglas writing the main dissent, an excellent dissent. In any event, that didn't work.

                     back to the United States, he was getting himself some publicity. Again, there were some disputes that arose. He appeared
                     on a television program with a parrot, as I remember it.

                     was doing was saying, "Okay, I want to get back to work" by saying, "Well, so I was a commu—" Without saying it, saying, "I
                     was a communist, and I'm sorry." Trumbo, of course, denied always that that was his intent, or the effect of what he said.

                     he did on this program—Dalton stuck by his principles, supported left-wing causes, associated with left-wing people, and never

                  <p class="noindent">What happened was when he was honored, [pauses] I believe, by the Screen Writers Guild, he made a statement, and I'm not sure
                     that I'm citing it ver[batim]: there were no heroes; there were only victims. And this led to a great deal of controversy
                     among the ten, with people lining up on one side or the other. With Albert Maltz pretty much the leader of the other side.
                     I don't remember just how they lined up.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But in any event in supporting his position, Dalton Trumbo made the argument, "Why, hell," he said, "when we decided to take
                     the First Amendment, all we were doing was trying to protect our jobs. And we're not entitled to be called heroes because
                     of that." Maltz took the position that the main consideration was <i>not</i> protecting our job, but was a political one to destroy the committee. And there were letters exchanged, arguing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Ring Lardner, Jr., got into the act, and, I think if I remember correctly, lined up more or less with Dalton. Finally, it
                     was Ring who wrote to me I believe, saying how there is this controversy. He didn't put it in the terms of heroes versus victims,
                     but what were the motivations of the nineteen at the time that they decided to stand on the First Amendment?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I wrote a letter—I think you have a copy of it—in which I stated in effect that both motivations were involved. Of course,
                     they wanted to save their jobs and also had political motivations of wanting to destroy the committee. That I couldn't say
                     to what extent, in the minds of each individual, which one was the stronger consideration. But that certainly in the long
                     run, you couldn't say it was simply jobs, because all of the people had the same opportunity that Dmytryk had to go back on
                     their principles and to protect their jobs. They made the choices, just as Dmytryk did, which indicated that, no matter, to
                     me at least, that no matter to what extent they wanted to keep their jobs, certainly political motivation was a very strong
                     one. Something along those lines is what I wrote.

                     take strong positions and fight for them—there was general agreement that I was right.

                     before in a different way. Do you happen to recall who was in jail with Dmytryk or whether there was anyone who was incarcerated
                     at the same location as Dmytryk who sort of saw the signs coming? Because the way you tell it, by the time he got out, he
                     was ready to talk to the committee.

                  <p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, there were indications that he had been talked to in jail, and actually the deal had been made prior
                     to the time that he got out. He was not alone wherever he was first incarcerated, but I do not remember who else was there.
                     But I do know this, that whoever was there had not—didn't have any inkling that Dmytryk was going to do this, and that apparently
                     Dmytryk had initiated the contacts which lead to the making of these arrangements.

                  <p class="noindent">I don't remember all of it, but it happened very quickly after he got out. I think it happened so quickly and in such a planned
                     way that it was just extremely unlikely that it would not have been planned before he got out. I don't say we have conclusive
                     evidence of that, but there are all those indications that this was a planned thing. Of course, he never contacted any of
                     the nineteen or the ten and discussed it with them. By the way, many of the others of the original nineteen, which included

                  <p class="noindent">Let me ask you something. This again has come up a couple of times, and perhaps it's more on a personal or philosophical level.
                     But so much has been written about the blacklist and the Hollywood Ten. I'm sure you're familiar with Victor Navasky's <i>Naming Names,</i> in which he attempted to examine the motivation of those who did name names: those who talked to the committee. Now, obviously,
                     you have taken the position—as you mentioning the story of Dmytryk, and some other stories that you've mentioned—of simply
                     not ever having anything to do again with those people who were turncoats. Is there something—in your own personal view—is
                     what I'm really asking— What is there in the combination of circumstances, the time, whatever it is, that has made this particular
                     betrayal so difficult to have any forgiveness for, on the part of so many people? Is there anything special about this situation
                     that has sort of— Essentially, the die is cast in terms of which side people are on? I don't know if my question is exactly
                     making sense, but—
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I wouldn't place everyone in the same position on the question of forgiveness. Either on the forgiver or who is to be
                     forgiven. For example, I can very well understand the position of those who say, "Okay, so they were wrong. They're trying
                     to make it up, and they're trying to act decently now. We shouldn't hold it—"
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I was so personally involved and in such intimate contact with them that it was a personal betrayal as well as a betrayal
                     of principles. Take, for example, Dmytryk. We had all of these meetings in which, you know, there was no blood oath, but everyone
                     was going to stand side by side. Everyone knew the consequences they faced. They all depended upon each other. And he got
                     this support. We went out, and people gave lots of money to help support them. There were meetings, you know.

                  <p class="noindent">They turned not only against themselves, but against all of these people.

                     principles that were involved. Not only understood them, they had a <i>deep</i> understanding. And then what they did is to turn around and turn on their best friends and people who had supported them
                     all of their lives. It was not only a political betrayal; it was a personal betrayal.

                  <p class="noindent">On the other hand, I would take this case of Sterling Hayden, which is a somewhat different case. Sterling Hayden wasn't that
                     heavily involved. He was pretty much of a loner, who had joined the Communist Party and so forth, but he had never worked
                     with a group such as this. He was a sort of an eccentric guy, anyway, in many ways. And he had— By the way, some of the others
                     who got up and went before the committee and cleansed themselves said how mistaken they were. You know, they were lying. They
                     knew that they had not done anything wrong, yet they were willing to crawl in the mud.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, Sterling Hayden, when he got up, was asked why he had joined the Communist Party. He said, "There were girls. I enjoy—"
                     You know, he made a joke out of it and so forth. He didn't demean himself to say that. But more importantly, very shortly
                     after he testified, he turned around and said, "I made a mistake." He didn't wait for anybody to offer him anything. He didn't
                     try to ingratiate himself [with] anybody. He turned around almost— I don't remember how long it was, but it was a very short
                     period of time in which he said, "It was wrong. What I did was wrong, and I wouldn't do it again."

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. A couple of questions came to mind while you were talking. First of all, in the original contract cases that you handled
                     for the blacklisted writers, why were those brought in federal court? You mentioned that they were in federal court—the first
                     ones that you won.

                  <p class="noindent">[pauses] I'm just trying to recall why we brought them in federal court. I think we had our choice of the state and federal
                     court, and there must have been some technical or other reasons. I can remember that that's a factor we considered, but I
                     just can't recall why we chose the federal courts.

                  <p class="noindent">On the question of the black market for writers, in your own personal experience, did it seem to you, or did you ever come
                     across situations where the producers really <i>knew</i> who was really writing the screenplays? Or were the producers themselves, wanting to get good writers, perhaps part of the
                     whole plot? How much of that went on?

                  <p class="noindent">I think they knew nine times out of ten, if not ten times out of ten. Look, there were people turning in screenplays under
                     their own names as though they had written them, who the producers knew could not write that kind

                     </div>of, that quality screenplay. They might not have been absolutely positive that it was Trumbo or Maltz. And I think most of
                     the time— I <i>know</i> that in certain instances they were told off the record, but officially the producer did not know.

                  <p class="noindent">You see, there was a need for these scripts. They put a lot of money into the motion picture, and the foundation of the motion
                     picture is the script. You don't have a good script, your chances of getting a profitable motion picture are pretty slim.

                  <p class="noindent">The industry itself, by the way, originally opposed the blacklist. Really didn't want the blacklist, but was forced into it
                     by the banking interests. There were one or two wild-eyed guys in the industry who wanted it, but the great majority did not
                     want it.

                     brief written by a lawyer who I know has never been able to write anything more than an average brief, I might not know who
                     wrote it, but I could say, "Look, that guy never wrote the brief." I think they knew. The fact that black market operations
                     were going on was widely— Everybody knew it was going on.

                  <p class="noindent">That's sort of what I expected, but— Finally before we go on, one question comes to mind. One screenwriter who is very politically
                     active, a member of the Communist Party, but, as I understand, was not called, was John Bright. Is there any particular reason
                     that you are aware of why he— He seems to have been such a logical candidate for having been called as the original group—
                     Now, of course later he was, but in the original nineteen—

                  <p class="noindent">I really don't know why John wasn't called. At that time, John had not been doing too well. John started out like a ball of
                     fire. Very able, you know, brilliant guy, but he had a drinking problem. I would say that they— Well,

                     </div>there were a lot of people that they could have called the first time. For example, they called Alvah Bessie, who was just
                     beginning as a screenwriter, and they didn't call Mike Wilson, who was a top screenwriter. Why did they take one and not the
                     other? I don't know.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. We're now about to launch into a maze of committees, hearings, prosecutions, and so on. Sort of have to slowly and patiently
                     pick our way through a lot of this. One of the things that I did want to ask you for your recollections of because it was
                     somewhat notorious locally, and there was a lot of press coverage of it, was that apparently in September of 1948, the [Jack
                     B.] Tenney Committee [California Senate Committee on Un-American Activities], the California version of HUAC, began investigation
                     of the California Labor School. According to press accounts at the time, you represented about ten people who were called
                     before that committee. In one episode, you and another attorney, Richard L. Rykoff, were thrown out of the hearing room. I
                     was wondering what you recall about the investigation of the California Labor School. According to the press accounts, its
                     director at that time was a man named David Hedly. And what was involved in the—?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">David Hedly?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Balter</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">David Hedly is the name I have.</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I thought it was Sid [Sidney] Davison. Well, maybe he became director later.</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">All I can really recall about the proceedings is that the Tenney Committee sought in every way to emulate the House Committee
                     on Un-American Activities, including what they allowed attorneys to do and what they didn't allow attorneys to do. While I
                     don't remember the exact details, I know that we tried to represent the witnesses more effectively.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You see, whenever we represented witnesses before a committee, we had
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">275</span> ―
                     </div>this kind of a problem. This applies to both the house committee and the Tenney Committee. And that is, the rules were that
                     you could advise your client, whisper to them, advise them, or they can ask you questions and you could answer his questions.
                     But that you could not say anything at all to the members of the committee. You couldn't say, "You're doing something illegal."
                     You couldn't make a formal legal objection. You're not allowed to do anything. While we violated these rules from time to
                     time, we did not persist in their violation.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So the problem we had each time was, do we want to take the chance on getting thrown out—because you get physically thrown
                     out, there isn't very much you can do about it—and leave our clients without counsel to represent them, or do we want to avoid
                     getting thrown out and not risk doing anything which will get us thrown out?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The answer to that question depended largely upon two things. One was how important we felt it was that counsel be by the
                     side of the witness at all times, which varied. There were some people who understood the situation and could handle themselves
                     perfectly. I sat alongside many people and hardly did anything, except sit. It wasn't called for. On the other hand, there
                     are other people who did fall all apart, like they do with almost anything if they didn't have somebody alongside them. That
                     was one factor on which we did— On the other hand, the second factor was how the witness felt about it. Did the witness want
                     us to make the kind of a fight which risked leaving them without counsel, or did they tell us, "We want you here"? That ought
                     to be decisive.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The first element I talked about would help us to advise the client whether or not we thought the client could act on his
                     or her own. The second was the wish of the client. Generally speaking, clients wanted us to not get thrown out. They wanted
                     us there, even clients who we thought could handle themselves

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As I remember it, the Tenney Committee in the first place was more stupid than the house committee people. Couldn't do as
                     well in exploiting a situation. The clients were more willing to have us stand up and fight the [Tenney] Committee. And they
                     had the risk of [our] getting thrown out. So that's why in one instance we got thrown out and the other we didn't.

                     too often. Does the witness not then, or did at that time, the way the committees were run, did the witness not then have
                     the right to say, "I'm not going to talk anymore because I don't have a lawyer"? Or was that not the situation?

                  <p class="noindent">We were often asked that question, and that's a question that has never been tested in the courts. It was our opinion with
                     the courts, as they were at that time, that probably they would have been held in contempt. We felt that that was not the
                     best issue on which to fight. So, generally speaking, we didn't.

                     thousands of dollars of expenditures and many, many hours of time on the part of the attorney. And it ties up the witness
                     for various purposes. So you don't go into that sort of thing lightly, and you don't do it unless you feel that it's worth
                     it.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, in 1948 and 1949 began a long series of events concerning a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, inquiring into communist
                     activities. Apparently, it started out inquiring about communist activities among federal employees. As early as December
                     of 1948, contempt citations had been issued against Henry Steinberg, Ben Dobbs, Samuel H. Kasinowitz—people who you represented.
                     Eventually, this blossomed into a number of people who were held in contempt. Apparently they were eventually—became known
                     as the Los Angeles Seventeen, or at least at one point. I know this was a very involved series of events, so I wonder if you
                     could share with us what you recall about these developments.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What was done by the U.S. attorney was to use this investigation as a means of attempting to imprison and keep in prison the
                     most prominent leaders of the Communist Party. The people that they subpoenaed were—for the most part, maybe all, but I'm
                     not sure—at least for the most part, were people who were publicly known as communists and who spoke publicly as communists.
                     Had no reason for and did not attempt to conceal their membership and officership in that. As a matter of fact, their work
                     was to spread that.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They were subpoenaed and they came— By the way, John [T.] McTernan and I jointly handled these cases. They came to us and
                     said what were the problems. They were perfectly willing to testify about themselves, and, as I
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">279</span> ―
                     </div>remember it, even about their activities. The problem was that they could not, and would not, name others. The question was,
                     "What is the best way of placing them in a position to resist the committee without naming others?" At that time, Leo Gallagher,
                     whom I think I've spoken of before, was a member of our firm. And there was a split within the firm, which led later on to
                     Leo leaving the firm. At that time, the law was quite unclear about the use of the Fifth Amendment in political cases. Although,
                     as a matter of principle, where communists were subject to prosecution under the Smith Act, it was in principle quite clear
                     that the Fifth Amendment should apply, but it had never been decided by any of the courts. The advice that John and I gave
                     was that if they admitted— If the witnesses admitted their own membership and their own participation, and then they were
                     asked the names of others, that in all, that the chance of using the Fifth Amendment as a defense was almost nil, if not actually
                     nil. By the way, Leo Gallagher did not disagree with that as a legal proposition. We advised that they therefore should answer
                     no questions, except their names. If they answered no questions, then, we thought that they had a good chance of winning under
                     the Fifth Amendment, relying on the Fifth Amendment.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Leo Gallagher's position was a political position, which was that communists should stand up proudly and say, "I'm a communist"
                     and—whatever the consequences are—accept the consequences. If they have to go to jail, they go to jail. If they have to sit
                     there indefinitely, they have to sit there indefinitely.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You see, the problem with contempt proceedings is that there are two kinds of contempt proceedings. One kind is so-called
                     criminal contempt; the other so-called civil contempt. Actually, the civil contempt, strange as that may appear off hand,
                     is by far the most difficult to deal with. The criminal contempt—you can be put in jail for six months, a year, whatever it
                     is. For a definite period, you're sentenced. In civil contempt, if you're asked a question
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">280</span> ―
                     </div>and you're ordered to answer it and you refuse, you can be kept in jail until you answer it. So that it can become an indefinite
                     term of imprisonment. So the U.S. attorney had come up with this device as a means of getting the leadership and putting them
                     in jail.

                     judge. Vicious, vicious red-baiter, one of the worst.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We, John and I, took the position that to follow Leo's advice would be to play right into the U.S. attorney's hand. Why should
                     we give the U.S. attorney what he wanted: an ability to put the people in jail? There was nothing unprincipled about relying
                     on the Fifth Amendment. It's a constitutional right, and that they should do so. Well, our clients, of course, decided to
                     follow the advice that John and I had given. Then started a whole series of proceedings, contempt proceedings, involving in
                     the long run about seventeen people. But in each stage there were different people involved. Some in two or three sets of
                     proceedings; others in one. It was a very complex ongoing sort of thing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The procedures [were] as follows: The witnesses are called before the grand jury, and they have to go into the grand jury
                     room without counsel. The U.S. attorney is in the grand jury room, but the witness cannot have counsel. However, the witness
                     can have counsel outside of the grand jury room, and have a right to say, "I want to go out and talk to my counsel before
                     responding to any questions." And so John and I appeared outside of the room originally, and we advised them of course to
                     claim the Fifth Amendment. There were a lot
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">281</span> ―
                     </div>of technical things, a lot of ways, that they tried to entrap the people, and that was avoided.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So after they refused to answer, the next procedure is witnesses are brought before a judge, in what is a public hearing.
                     The record is presented to the judge: the witness was asked the following question, and took the following position. The U.S.
                     attorney asks for an order, directing the witness to answer the question. We, of course, appeared at that stage of the proceedings.
                     It was a public hearing. Our argument of course was that they had a right to claim the Fifth Amendment. And we wanted to put
                     in a lot of evidence about what had happened to people who were in the Communist Party.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By the way, the Fifth Amendment is not intended to protect the guilty ones; it is intended to protect the innocent ones. What
                     it protects you against is not against being found guilty, but against being prosecuted. By using your own testimony to prosecute
                     you.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We appeared before a judge, Pierson M. Hall, now dead, with whom I had many experiences of various kinds subsequent to this,
                     which you may be interested in. But in any event, this judge was, as far as red-baiting and riding roughshod over people he
                     believed were communists was concerned, was on a par with Carter. So he [Hall] gave us short shrift. He ordered the witnesses
                     to go back to the grand jury and answer the questions. Went back to the grand jury room; again, refused to answer. And then
                     that's followed by a second public court hearing. Brought back before the judge. Asked that they be cited for contempt for
                     having— The reason you need the order first is that you cannot be cited for this kind of contempt unless you have refused
                     to obey a court order. Originally, there was no court order. They were just asked a question, and the court ordered them to
                     answer.
                  </p>

                     </div>afternoon—the first hearing, you know, on should they answer the question. They went back up, took an hour or two, came back
                     at four o'clock or so, and were cited for contempt. We asked for a continuance, for an opportunity to make a showing. Wanted
                     to represent them, authorities and briefs, present evidence. And he of course refused a continuance. The government put on
                     evidence, not only the record. We put on evidence. The evidence we put on was to show the fear of prosecution, that it was
                     a justified fear, not a farce. The hearing went on, and we kept asking. It went on eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten o'clock.
                     I think he adjourned for a half hour for dinner or something like that. And we kept asking him. Nine o'clock, ask go over
                     till tomorrow? Ten o'clock, go over until tomorrow? No. Finally, close to midnight we had put on all of the evidence we could
                     at that time.

                  <p class="noindent">The judge ordered the case submitted, found them guilty of contempt, and ordered them— Sentenced them to, I guess he sentenced
                     them, to go to jail until they answered the questions. There were different stages of which they were given specific sentences,
                     and other stages in which they were ordered to jail until they answered the questions. The sequence of these, my recollection

                  <p class="noindent">Different witnesses. Some were the same. So, at that time, we made a motion for—to file notice of appeal, made a motion for
                     bail, pending appeal.

                  <p class="noindent">The judge said, "Oh, it's too late. I'll hear that tomorrow." No, I think he said—I'm not sure whether he said tomorrow or
                     he put it over a couple of days or over three days. And nothing, you know. The fact that when we asked for

                     </div>time, that was fine, but as long as— Once he got them in jail, it was too late.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Anyway, he was able to drag out the proceedings. We had to apply for bail in the trial court and get denied, before we could
                     apply for bail in the appellate court. He dragged it out, for, I don't remember the details, but dragged it out, I remember,
                     for days, and finally denied our application for bail, pending appeal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We went up to the Ninth Circuit, got a hearing on the bail there, and got bail granted. As I remember it, you see, my problem
                     is that there were so many of these, and certain things happen in some stages. I don't remember whether this was the first
                     one or later on. There came a point at which they heard the motion on bail and the matter on its merits at the same time.
                     I believe initially it was just bail.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But anyway we got an order releasing them. Picked up the order. The hearings are in San Francisco; the Ninth Circuit sat in
                     San Francisco at that time. Got the certified copy of the order, came back, couldn't find Judge Hall. He was nowhere to be
                     found. The time we saw him down the hall, tried to find him, then his clerk said he didn't know where he had gone.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The order had to be entered in the court below. And the order of the appellate court is to the trial court, for the trial
                     court to order the release on bail. See, the court of appeals doesn't itself order release; it tells the trial court to order
                     release. So that we had to get this order entered at the appellate court and have a new order issued. We couldn't. He wasn't
                     around.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We went to other judges. Ordinarily in a matter like this, it's a pro forma matter, and any judge will handle it. Went to
                     various judges. None of them would touch it. They said, "This is Judge Hall's matter. We're not going to— You have to find
                     Judge Hall." I don't remember how long the delays were, but he played us around for quite a while.

                  <p class="noindent">People were in jail. And Judge Hall can't be found for several days. Judge Hall couldn't be found, couldn't be found. Finally,
                     he appeared. Finally, we found him. And he had no choice, except to enter the order. Then we had further proceedings, and
                     he did the same thing again on the further proceedings, even though it was clear that the appelate court had held that they
                     were identical proceedings. He did the identical thing. We had to go up, again, to the court of appeal in order to get bail.
                     Again, trouble finding him and so forth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We finally prevailed in all of the cases. It was held that they had a right to claim the Fifth Amendment, and they therefore
                     were not in the contempt of court. That all of this had been done improperly. But this went on for months.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">An interesting thing— I must tell you one very, very, I think it is, very funny thing. One of the witnesses called, who was
                     not one of the original ones, but called to later say— Was a man by the name of Newman, Milt Newman. And he did a stupid thing.
                     He had been one of the ones that they had tried to serve in the first instance, but they hadn't been able to find him to serve
                     him, to bring him before the grand jury. They finally found him and served him. They had witnesses to the fact that he was
                     served. And he didn't appear. Now that is a cold contempt, and he had no excuse for not appearing. So he came up and he was
                     cited for contempt for not appearing. We made a— We had nothing to fight with, but we made what fight we could. And he sentenced
                     that man to— See, that was under a statute. He sentenced him to a fine of $2,500, and, I think it was, 90 days in jail, or
                     six months. I guess six months in jail. I'm not sure, but it was either 90 days, 120 days, or six months.
                  </p>
                  
                  <hr class="pb">

                  </div>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Newman—after he told us, we had really chewed him out, because it was a crazy thing that he had done. He told us, afterwards
                     he went up to the jail, and people started talking to him. They told him that he was one of those people who had been brought
                     up before the grand jury like the others. And it's been like a revolving door: they'd been going in and out of jail, in and
                     out of jail. He tried to tell the people there, he said, "I'm stuck. I'm really one of those people, but I have a different
                     case. And I'm stuck."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, it so happened that the statute provided that the penalty was $2,500. The ordinary penalty is a maximum fine and the
                     maximum sentence. This statute, however, read $2,500 or six months in jail. It had used the word <i>or.</i> A quick check [of] the law, and the law is if one part of the sentence is satisfied, the other side, part, becomes invalid.
                     We rushed in, we paid the $2,500, and we made an application for his release. Again, Hall could not be found. He's not around.
                     And the local guy wouldn't hear it—the argument. Finally there happened to be, I think it was in Arizona, a judge from Arizona
                     or New Mexico, someplace, who was sitting <i>pro tem.</i> We got him to hear the matter, and he released the man.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Newman told us afterwards that all prisoners [said], "Oh, we told you." All the prisoners said, all said to him, "You're going
                     to be out before you know it." They really had him it turned out. [laughs]
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Hall was so anxious to just give him everything he could, and he was so mad that he didn't. And Hall's a pretty good lawyer.
                     He was just so mad and so vicious that he didn't notice the <i>or.</i> So, he was absolutely stuck with that. I think I gave you the main heart of this.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I'll tell you a little bit, some interesting things, about Hall. We had some curious experiences with some of these judges
                     who treated us as viciously as it was possible to be treated on political cases. We later came up before [them]
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>in civil cases, ordinary cases; they embarrassed us sometimes on how well they treated us, because deep down they respected
                     the kind of fight we made and so forth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, I was an attorney in an air crash case [<i>Wiener</i> v. <i>United Air Lines</i>], along with a lot of other attorneys. There were about twenty attorneys, and there were two of us selected to handle the
                     matter on behalf of all of the attorneys. I was one, and a former president of the state bar, a fellow by the name of Frank
                     Belcher, was the other one. We tried a five-month case before Hall. And he just—you couldn't have asked for a— He was really
                     very angry at the— He felt strongly about whatever he was involved in. He sympathized very much with the plaintiffs, whose
                     husbands or wives or children had been killed. They were trying to collect damages and were being resisted. He gave us about
                     as good a trial as we could get.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then there were some cases being transferred from out-of-state courts about the same air crash accident, where he had the
                     opportunity to appoint counsel to represent those out-of-state people. He appointed me, and I got one of the nicest fees I've
                     ever made.

                     according to where the people lived, where the ticket was purchased, where the airplane was landing. He was pushing good national

                     cases brought before him, it would have been exactly the same thing that we had before.

                     that in a little bit. While we're still on the grand jury cases, before we catch up for today, there was one episode that
                     happened in June of 1949, as a matter of fact June 9, 1949, where you were held in contempt by Judge Hall. Apparently, the
                     prosecutor, at this point not Mr. Carter, but a Max Goldschein, called you to the stand.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Max Goldschein was an attorney who was sent out from Washington to handle these cases. After we'd won a few, they sent him
                     out to handle these cases, and he fared no better than the others did.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">No, here's what was involved in that case. In that case I represented Dorothy Healey. Dorothy Healey was an officer of the
                     Communist Party and had the title, I think, of secretary. She was ordered to produce the books and records of the Communist
                     Party. Now, the law—the Fifth Amendment does not
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                  <p class="noindent">Dorothy Healey, however, filed an affidavit: that at the time that she was served and all times since then, she did not have
                     possession of any of the books and records, and therefore was unable to comply with the court order to produce the books and
                     records. That made it very difficult for them, because you can't hold a person in contempt for failing to do something which
                     is not within their power to do. And no one can turn over records of which they do not have possession or control. So they
                     were stuck. They were trying by various means to establish that Dorothy was lying and that she, in fact, did have possession
                     of the books and records.

                     me was privileged. An attorney not only has the right, he has the duty not to disclose privileged information. The prosecution
                     nevertheless called me to the witness stand and started asking me questions about what I knew: about the possession of the
                     books and records. I told them that all of the knowledge that I had was obtained as a result of privileged communication from
                     my client Dorothy Healey. And I was duty bound not to reveal it. This is ABC by the way. It's so crystal clear that it's like

                  <p class="noindent">Nevertheless, the judge ordered me to answer the questions. I refused. And he held me in contempt. This was one afternoon.
                     However, I had told him that I didn't have counsel. That I wanted an opportunity to get counsel to represent <i>me</i> in this matter. And I wanted a further hearing on the contempt. So he continued the matter until the next morning. I'd say
                     ten o'clock. I immediately got in contact with my office, and I appeared the next morning at ten o'clock with John [T.] McTernan
                     as my principal counsel. I believe it was John.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But, in addition, my office had made telephone calls around town. There were approximately fifty lawyers. All kinds of lawyers,
                     not necessarily Left— Some left-wing and some right-wing lawyers appearing as my counsel, entered their appearance as my counsel.
                     They filled the courtroom.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, you see, this is a principle among lawyers. I don't care where you stand politically. A lawyer, unless he's an absolute
                     crackpot, you know, is going

                     about the confession he made to you." You just are not allowed to do it. Because otherwise you can't represent your clients
                     if you can't keep confidential what your client tells you.

                  <p class="noindent">So this was really a broad, representative group. Appeared at ten o'clock, and the judge did not come out. We saw prosecuting
                     counsel going into the judge's chambers and coming out of the judge's chambers. We sat and waited. Everybody sat and waited.
                     Finally at eleven fifteen, eleven thirty, the judge came out and announced that he was dismissing the contempt proceedings.
                     That was the end of it.

                     time? In other words, from the way you tell the story, it seems as though the judge has made a series of rulings in which
                     he knows he can't— Are not going to be upheld, but simply for the purpose of— During that period of time, were judges so fully

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I don't— The judges were fully involved, and you certainly couldn't get a fair trial or a fair hearing. How many judges
                     would have gone as far as Hall did, I don't know. I think that probably only a small minority of the judges would have carried
                     it to the extreme that he did. They would always try to find some way of ruling against you and would rule against you. But
                     there aren't many judges who would have run away from you—avoided you. As a matter of fact, one time when we sought Hall,
                     he practically ran down the court when we called him. He just ran away; now, there aren't many judges who would. There aren't
                     many judges who would have done—would have gone along with calling an attorney to testify. There are some, and I would say
                     that he was one of the few.

                  <p class="noindent">But the general inability to get a fair hearing in which the legal and factual considerations weren't given any kind of real
                     honest consideration— There probably weren't a half a dozen judges in the United States that would have given a fair hearing.
                     Of course there were some. I don't know of anyone in Los Angeles who would have done that kind of thing that we're talking

                     The federal grand jury doesn't have that function. The federal grand jury merely sits to consider indictments and to return
                     indictments if the jurors find sufficient evidence. In the federal court, they're merely an instrument for starting a criminal

                     the time. And yet, on the other hand, very little has really been said or written about it. I wonder what you recall about
                     the Civil Rights Congress and that organization.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, if I were to give you a shorthand description of the Civil Rights Congress, I would say it was the Left wing of the
                     civil liberties movement, which was primarily engaged in defending the rights of political people, left-wing political people.
                     The ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] did that also, but it was only a part of these activities
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Also, the approach, I would say, was quite different. The ACLU would approach a case like this as a purely First Amendment,
                     civil liberties issue. One of the problems we had sometimes with the ACLU in these cases was that—this is a statement I'm
                     sure you've heard—if you have a friend like that, you don't need an enemy. Sometimes applied, not always. It sometimes applied
                     because— Particularly in San Francisco, there was an ACLU there. If they wrote a brief in favor of the Communist Party, it
                     was a fifty-page brief. Forty-nine pages would be an attack on the Communist Party, and then the fiftieth page would say,
                     "But nevertheless, reluctantly, we have to say that they're entitled to the protection of the First Amendment." And even here
                     in Los Angeles, where it was much better than San Francisco, you'd have, for example, the attorney for the ACLU standing up
                     and saying, "I want to make it clear that I'm not a communist. I don't agree with them, but—" Now, if they wouldn't carry
                     it to the lengths that— I'm really not exaggerating what they did in San Francisco, except instead of forty-nine pages in
                     fifty, it might be twenty pages and five pages. [laughter] But I mean, they really wrote the greater part of the brief attacking
                     the Communist Party.
                  </p>

                     </div>that pose. They were much more a left-wing political organization, which would never take on the kind of a protective and
                     disassociation posture that the ACLU would take on.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, you mentioned the attorneys down here in Los Angeles. Now, of course, at that time there was A. L. [Abraham Lincoln]
                     Wirin. And I believe that Fred Okrand had come back from the army and was back with the ACLU.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, A. L. Wirin was the principal attorney, and he appeared all the time. He and I have been very good friends. We had a
                     falling-out about his insistence on—even when he said he wouldn't do it—standing up and starting argument by a disavowal.
                     I told him if you're defending a murderer, you wouldn't have to stand [and] say, "I want the court to know I'm not a murderer,
                     and I don't agree with murder." Why do you have to say this with the Communist Party?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But of course there was a difference. My argument, in principle, was correct. As a practical matter, he needed a protective
                     covering, or felt he needed protection. You want to remember that the ACLU had removed Elizabeth Gurley Flynn from their board
                     because she was a communist. They had engaged in some pretty good red-baiting on their own. They had later— Later years said
                     they regretted it, and it was a mistake. But nevertheless we're talking about what they were like during that period.

                  <p class="noindent">And I don't want to overstate the sort of thing that Wirin did. Because he would also do a lot of work, and he was not one
                     of those who would do the equivalent of writing a twenty-page brief with most of it being an attack. But he did make it a
                     practice to sort of place himself above the fray and to disavow. I felt a principled lawyer shouldn't do that. And we had,
                     for example— We got a lawyer in the Smith Act case [<i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>] that

                  <p class="noindent">There was no formal relationship, but I think that there was no doubt that the Communist Party helped establish and supported
                     the Civil Rights Congress. On the other hand, not all Civil Rights Congress members or supporters were communists. It was
                     certainly an organization that was sympathetic to and influenced by the Communist Party.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, it concentrated on political cases. You want to remember that the attack was very widespread. There were ordinances
                     being adopted. There were contempt proceedings and the Smith Act prosecutions. There were loyalty oaths. There were all kinds
                     of things going on. The attack took many forms. For example, the ACLU eventually did come out against the loyalty oaths. But
                     it took them time. So the Civil Rights Congress was against them from day one, or before day one. They, I say, they were a
                     left-wing ACLU and were consistently out in the forefront of all of the fights. Largely protecting those who were communists
                     or accused of being communists or treated along with communists, they were primarily fighting the red scare.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, last time you mentioned the story of David Brown, who was apparently director of the Civil Rights Congress for a time,
                     and the fact that he had become an informer for the FBI at some point. We didn't have time for that story. I wonder if you
                     could tell it today.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I believe that Dave's title was executive secretary of the Los Angeles Civil Rights Congress. In any event, that's the kind
                     of position he occupied. It was a full-time job. He and his wife were very devoted people, both of whom worked day and night
                     on behalf of the Civil Rights Congress and the things for which it stood.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I think I've indicated earlier the Civil Rights Congress was involved in many civil liberty fights. But a large proportion
                     of them [were] related to the Left and were the defense of Communist Party people and other Left organizations. David, as
                     I said, was a very hard worker. He, among other things, carried on a very heavy speaking agenda—going out to various organizations
                     and speaking.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I very frequently spoke with him at meetings, so that we spent a lot of time together. In addition, I spent time with him
                     on cases that I handled for the Civil Rights Congress, cases involving various statutes. I remember a statute requiring—or
                     an ordinance requiring communists to register. I remember some local loyalty-oath ordinances. There were all kinds of local
                     litigation and local ordinances and laws which were, for the most part, successfully attacked as being unconstitutional.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Dave, of course, worked for a very low salary. I don't remember what it was, but no one got rich working for the Civil Rights
                     Congress. It developed

                     </div>that although most of us were not aware of it, that he developed a drinking problem. Was doing a lot of drinking, although
                     I never did see him drunk. But there was no doubt that he drank heavily.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">From what we learned later, it appears that he was originally a bona fide member and official of the Civil Rights Congress,
                     totally devoted to its cause. And he, like many other people on the Left, was approached by the FBI and asked to cooperate
                     with them: to give them names and activities and so forth. It appears also that he initially refused. As a matter of fact,
                     stood fast for some time. But, eventually, his need for money in order to meet his need for alcohol caused him to initially
                     give in, on a limited basis, furnishing a little bit of information, which he thought would not harm anybody. And then he
                     became a totally full-fledged informer.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What then happened is that the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities was planning hearings out on the West
                     Coast. I believe those hearings were scheduled for Seattle, but I'm not sure. They were scheduled somewhere in the West Coast.
                     As we learned later, Dave Brown was approached and was told that he was expected to testify before the house committee. This
                     was a policy followed by the FBI and other government agencies. They would use an informer. And then at a certain point where
                     they thought the informer's greatest value was by having him go public—after which he could obviously no longer be an informer—they
                     would require the informer to do that.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Dave resisted. Said that he didn't want to do it; it'd destroy his marriage and so forth.</p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">She was active in the congress and active in— Generally, politically on the Left.</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, all of this that I'm telling you was unknown to any of us until later. What happened is one day I got a call at home,
                     I believe it was, from his wife or someone from the family, saying that Dave had disappeared. That he had left no word. He
                     had gone with the car. He had taken a substantial amount of his clothing, so it wasn't— It was obvious that he hadn't just
                     simply gotten into an accident or something. It was obvious that he had taken with him things that he wouldn't—one would not
                     ordinarily have taken unless they were going somewhere. He had never said anything about going anywhere—wasn't scheduled to
                     go anywhere—and that appeared to be great cause for alarm.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">No one at that time suspected that Dave was an informer. Because he had been such a devoted and excellent worker, who worked
                     fourteen, fifteen hours a day for the things which I'm sure he continued to believe in while he was acting as an informer.
                     We put out—reported it to the police—a missing person report. Sent out feelers to various parts of the cities where we thought
                     he might be.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">No one had heard anything from him. And then one day he turned up, somewhere up north. May have been Seattle, but I'm not
                     sure. We read in the newspaper— No, I think he telephoned his wife. I'm not sure of the exact details, but by some form, he
                     advised either his wife or someone else, but I think it was his wife, of what had happened. He did it by telephone. And had
                     said that under no circumstances was he going to testify against the people with whom he'd been working. He was urged to come
                     back to Los Angeles.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He came back. I met with him for several hours and took a long, detailed statement from him, which set forth the facts that
                     I have related, but which I did

                     </div>not know until the time of the statement. He was a crushed man. There was no question about it. His wife left him. All of
                     his friends obviously would have nothing to do with him. He was fired from his CRC [Civil Rights Congress] job. And then I
                     heard that he became a taxicab driver somewhere else; I think San Francisco or somewhere other than Los Angeles, I believe.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I heard also from time to time, over the years, that he was trying to get back into the Left—in some way to work in the Left—and
                     that he consistently rejected by everyone. I think that the last that I heard—of even of this kind or anything about him—was
                     maybe twenty, twenty-five years ago.

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah. You mentioned that you thought that he probably continued to actually believe in what he was doing, at the same time
                     that he was an informer. Given your knowledge of the many different informers that were uncovered during this period of time,
                     was that a fairly common thing? That people would have that almost schizophrenic approach to it?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">No, it was not. There were many people who, under duress, folded, particularly testifying before the house committee; many
                     people because their whole careers rested on it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But I know of— Maybe a flat no was not correct. I know of no one who had the kind of commitment, had really made the kind
                     of sacrifices, and had had the kind of devotion that he had. Most of these other people were people who, for the most part,
                     were either on the periphery of the movement and not very greatly involved, who it was not surprising would do this kind of
                     thing. For the most part, the deeply committed people did not act that way.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I can give you an example of a person I knew who was a deeply committed person at one time, although the way he goes— Howard
                     Fast. Howard was
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">300</span> ―
                     </div>very active on the Left and totally committed. When he decided to become an informer, as he did, he turned against everything
                     that he had believed in. That is true of most of the Communist Party officials that—and there were several of them—that left
                     and became informers. Now, there are others who left and went on to other activities, but did not become informers, like Dorothy
                     Healey, for example.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So, I think he [David Brown] was a rather unique case. I worked with him so closely, and I know how hard he worked. I just
                     can't believe that he really wasn't trying to do his best to promote the things he was talking about. Also, at the last moment,
                     he knew what he was doing to his life when he refused to testify. It was a little late, but, nevertheless, I'm sure he could
                     have gotten a good deal of money. And, you know, these people who, like him— He [could] have become a part of the stable of
                     informers, who went around testifying in various cases and who made a great deal of money. He could have gotten himself well
                     fixed if he had done this. And he did not; he refused to. So here you have a man who had this weakness and yielded to it.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, we're on the subject of this informing and undercover operations by the FBI. In the last, oh, ten years especially, since
                     the revelations under the Freedom of Information Act and through various congressional committees, there have been a lot of
                     lawsuits. The National Lawyers Guild of course has one going; Frank Wilkinson; many lawsuits challenging decades of surveillance
                     and undercover work by the FBI. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression that there was very little legal challenge
                     to the undercover work of the FBI going on at that time, in the forties and fifties, even when cases such as you've described
                     would be uncovered. Is my impression correct? If so, why do you think that was, that there was not a legal challenge back
                     then when so much of it was going on?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Well, the problem during that period of time was that the immediate problem— The immediate attacks and the Supreme Court and
                     the rulings of the Court were of such a nature— First of all, we were losing much clearer and much more important cases. There
                     would have been no chance. To have devoted energy to that, when there were other more immediate cases, would not have made
                     much sense. It wasn't on the order of the day.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We did, in a way, tackle this. As a matter of fact, John McTernan in this office tried the case of <i>Jencks</i> v. <i>United States</i> and handled that in the Supreme Court. [Clinton] Jencks was indicted for, I believe, for an allegedly false, anticommunist—that's
                     hardly it—noncommunist affidavit. He was tried and convicted. During the trial, there were several informers who testified;
                     they were part of the stable [of informers] that I referred to. During the trial, John demanded copies of the statements or
                     reports that the informers had furnished the government with. The trial judges refused to order those produced in the <i>Jencks</i> case, but that was reversed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The rule was laid down, and I believe, in a five to four decision. And by the way, on a very important legal point we have
                     that we're entitled to see those reports and to use them for cross-examination. The trial court had said you can't— You're
                     not entitled to those statements unless you can make a preliminary showing that the statements are inconsistent with the testimony.
                     [laughter] Of course, there was no way, not having access to the statements. There was absolutely no way of making that kind
                     of a showing of such inconsistency. Still, only five—it was only a five to four vote. But this was a real blow against the
                     use of informers and a great help, for example, in the Smith Act case, where we got the benefit of this because— Well, take
                     for example Jencks. Jencks was retried. The statements were furnished, and he was acquitted. Because these informers lied,
                     and invariably there were contradictions between their reports and
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>their testimony. So this was, in a way, an attack upon informers. But if you're talking about the legality of using informers,
                     that has not been attacked. Now, that was attacked recently here in the case against the [Los Angeles City] Police Department
                     [<i>Coalition Against Police Abuse</i> v. <i>Board of Police Commissioners</i>].

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. So I take it— Well, perhaps the five to four decision in the <i>Jencks</i> case— As I understand what you're saying is that a challenge to the use of informers probably would have swung the Court
                     somewhat the other way. Otherwise, the Court—

                  <p class="noindent">I don't think even today you could get an across-the-board ruling on the use of informers. All that you reasonably could hope
                     to get them, and would get in litigation today, is that there has to be good cause for putting informers into our organization,
                     and that you cannot put informers in an organization unless you have some good basis to believe that there is or is about
                     to be a violation of some criminal law. Of course, in those days, there were all sorts of things that they could have justified
                     going into using these informers for: Smith Act prosecutions, perjury prosecution, and so forth.

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. Now, what effect did the—especially in terms of the Communist Party—what effect did the discovery of these informers
                     during the McCarthy period have on the way that the party conducted its business and the party operated, both on the morale
                     as well as precautions that were taken? And did the attorneys in the party or who worked with the party develop any particular

                  <p class="noindent">Well, people tried to be as careful—about things that they thought should be confidential—as they could. The main problem,
                     during this period,
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You want to remember that the Communist Party has never been convicted of engaging in any unlawful acts. Never. It has never
                     even been charged with engaging in unlawful acts. And in the Smith Act prosecution, it was members of the Communist Party
                     who were charged, and ultimately acquittals were obtained there. And the government had to stop those prosecutions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The real problem was that a person whose name was revealed as a member of the Communist Party could lose his job, could get
                     kicked out of school. All sorts of things could happen to that person merely on such revealing. And that was the important
                     thing to try to protect—the most important thing. As a practical matter, it was very difficult—impossible—because the Communist
                     Party was just filled with informers: either informers who had gone in as informers, and in many instances, people who were
                     in the party and who became informers while they were in the party. Many of them [were] threatened, or many of them had opportunities
                     to make money, etcetera, and became informers. As a matter of fact, it's often been said that during that period the Communist
                     Party's finances were perhaps in large part sustained by the dues of informers paid by the government.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So there were precautions taken. You were careful not to say anything over the phone that could be avoided. You were careful
                     about talking in your own home or in your offices or about what you wrote in letters, because we knew letters were opened.
                     You did that, but I don't think that they had—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, I think that the FBI probably knew more about what was going on in the Communist Party than any single
                     Communist Party member—anyone. You know, because they had it from all over the country. They had hundreds of informers. And
                     as a practical matter, I don't think it was

                  <p class="noindent">Now, what about the effect on morale, if there were so many informers at this time?</p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, you see, it's very difficult, for me at least, to say that what happened was the effect of morale on the discovery of
                     the informers. The reason is that so many other things were going on that had an effect on morale: the prosecutions that were
                     going on, the firing of people, the whole McCarthyism business. The whole thing certainly affected the morale. But I would
                     be very disinclined to select any one thing, like the informers, to say that was the cause of it. It certainly contributed.
                     Now, what happened of course was that the size of the Communist Party greatly diminished. People dropped out; very few new
                     ones joined.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Again, I would say that up until the disclosures about [Joseph] Stalin, there were some people who left the Communist Party
                     because they disagreed with it and some of the positions that were taken. They took the position that it was too close to
                     the Soviet Union: ideologically that the Soviet Union could do no wrong. I'm talking about an ideological thing. But there
                     were very few.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But beginning with the [Nikita] Khrushchev revelations, there were a lot of people who dropped out of the party because of
                     the disagreements. There were some as— Particularly about Czechoslovakia, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and a lot of people
                     who had believed that the Soviet Union was a different kind of a country than it was indicated. Its leadership was different
                     than was later more fairly, clearly established. And [they] simply disagreed and dropped out.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I, myself, for many, many, many years tended to disbelieve anything bad that was said about the Soviet Union. The reason for
                     it was that so much of what was said was, in fact, lies, and we had no way of distinguishing the lies
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>from the truth. We know, for example, that if you go back to the beginning of World War II—well, the invasion of the Soviet
                     Union, you know, you got our press. And it was true the Soviet Union took a beating in the early days, but our press painted
                     it as though the Soviet Union would be finished in six weeks—that morale had died. Well, they told all kinds of lies. Those
                     were lies. It turned out that the Soviet Union was really— Well, it made a lot of mistakes in the beginning of the war. It
                     was really very strong, and the people supported it overwhelmingly.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So, when you hear those lies and know that they're lies—they're revealed to be lies—then somebody else says something like
                     the trials that occurred afterwards. We were told, in our papers, a lot of things that turned out to be true about those trials.
                     But I, for one, didn't believe them, because I'd heard so many other lies. That was the problem.

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, I knew him. No, not very well. He lived in New York; that was his home. I met him maybe half a dozen times, eight or ten
                     times, either when I was in New York or when he was out in California [at] parties, social gatherings. Had some conversations
                     with him.

                  <p class="noindent">I can remember one particular event that sticks in my mind because it was such an unusual evening. This was I guess about
                     1954, summer of ['5]3, ['5]4, just when the Hollywood Ten were getting out of jail. And I was in New York or something; I
                     don't remember what. I went to an antifascist refugee dinner with friends of mine, Abe [Abraham J.] Isserman and his wife
                     Joan. He was one of the attorneys in the Hollywood Ten—I mean in the first Smith Act case, the <i>Dennis</i> case [<i>Dennis</i> v. <i>United States</i>]. We were planning—

                  <p class="noindent">Martin Popper, who was one of the attorneys in the Hollywood Ten case and had been executive secretary of the [National Lawyers]
                     Guild for many years, was having a welcome home party for Dalton Trumbo, who had just gotten out of jail a day or two before.
                     At this dinner, Howard Fast came over to our table; Howard was at that dinner also. Came over to our table and suggested that
                     afterwards we go out and have a drink or something. We told him we were going to Martin Popper's house. And why didn't he
                     come along, because the Poppers are very hospitable people. We thought that there'd be no question. It turned out that, well,
                     the Poppers weren't particularly friendly with Fast. They weren't particularly friendly with him, and Dalton Trumbo had a
                     deep and abiding hate for Howard Fast, whom he considered an egocentric fraud. Anyway, we went over to this party at the Poppers.
                     I think there were twenty-five, thirty people there. Dalton, as usual on these things, was pretty much the center of attention.
                     Dalton Trumbo is, I think, of all the people I have ever known, the wittiest conversationalist. Just like this, [snaps fingers]
                     it comes one after another. And the stories he tells! And I don't mean jokes. Events—and his ability to describe things and
                     his use of language: absolutely extraordinary. He tends to capture, take over, unless there was— And this was particularly
                     true that night, because he was the guest of honor. He had just come out of jail. He was talking about his jail experiences,
                     what it was like in jail, and Howard Fast broke in. Howard Fast by the way— Dalton had served a year. And Howard Fast had
                     done ninety days previously. He'd been in contempt for ninety days. Howard Fast had no sense of humor. None. He couldn't,
                     he didn't, just didn't know what was funny. He <i>was</i> a very good writer on certain kinds of writing, you know, but he just had— But whereas Dalton has an enormous sense of humor.
                     Anyway, Howard Fast broke in and started telling about how, during his ninety days in jail, he had built up a class in Marxism,
                     and

                     </div>about the prison and what he had accomplished during these ninety days. The point he was making— That in all circumstances,
                     wherever you are, if you are a true Leftist, you can, you can do things. Dalton had been talking about baseball games, and
                     you know, talking entirely different kinds of things, not that he was anything of this kind. And then Dalton took over, and
                     for about two hours engaged comically with Fast, in which he absolutely destroyed him. I wish I could remember. Fast wasn't
                     aware of what was happening to him. He [Trumbo] ridiculed him. And I remember how he was saying, he said, "Our jail, too,
                     we had people who we'd call ninety-day wonders." He was referring to people who had a ninety-day sentence. In any event, Howard
                     looked like such a schmuck, you know. It was just unbelievable. I think that was the last time I saw him. I may have seen
                     him afterwards, but it is the last time that I can remember seeing him. He's a very egotistical man, who did have a flair
                     for and an ability to write certain kinds of things. He wrote some excellent books.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Oh, I know, there was something. I almost had a connection with him. Later on, after he became an informer, one of his books
                     was purchased for a motion picture. Which one was it? I don't remember. And somebody approached me—it's all very vague in
                     my memory—someone came to me and, I think, indicated that Howard would be interested in talking to me about some legal problems
                     that he had. I didn't see Howard in connection with that. And I said I wasn't interested. I can't remember the name. I think
                     a movie was made out of it.

                     what role did the guild play?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, it so happens that I have a file on that that I could get, if you want to get any details. I'd have to refer to the
                     files. But I want to tell you an interesting problem of recollection that I have. I have, two or three instances, participated
                     in seminars at guild conferences and conventions on the history of the guild. I have talked about that period. When I was
                     asked the first time to talk—that was seven years ago, eight or ten years ago—my initial impression was well, gee, we didn't
                     do much. We were just trying to remain alive, stay in existence. We, of course, did carry on a vigorous fight against being
                     placed on the attorney general's list. I don't know if that will mean anything to anybody, but there was then— The attorney
                     general kept a list of subversive organizations. And there was a procedure whereby he gave organizations notice that he intended
                     them to be placed—that he intended to place an organization on the list. And then ordinarily what would happen is that he
                     would just place them on the list. Well, the guild filed a lawsuit and got a temporary, preliminary injunction against his
                     placing the guild on the list. And then there was extensive litigation that went on for a number of years; I don't remember
                     how many. But in the end, there was never a final decision, as I remember the litigation, but finally the attorney general
                     simply withdrew his notice and the litigation was dropped. While people were always saying the guild was on the attorney general's
                     list, it was in a way true, because he said he was going to place it.

                     </div>But it was technically not true; he had never placed it on the list. And so a large part of our energies, no doubt, was devoted
                     to that fight in that litigation.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So when I first started to review that period, it seemed to me that, well, we did a little—some little things here and there.
                     Our membership dropped down to the very, very few. I think in Los Angeles here, for example, we may have had five or ten active
                     members, maybe fifty, sixty who paid their dues. It dropped way down. It was just trouble to keep it alive. But then I went
                     to the library. I had not saved back issues of the guild publications; they're in the library. I found that we had really
                     carried on an enormous amount of activity during that period, all kinds of various— We had written articles on the House Committee
                     to Investigate Un-American Activities, on the Mundt-Nixon bill. But in addition to that, in many areas we did work. We did
                     work on social security. We had people testifying before Congress on those issues. As a matter of fact, if I got my report—my
                     notes—out, I could tell you in great detail what we did. But all I know, all I can remember now, because it's several years
                     since I've last talked about it, is that we've had a very, very broad scope of activities. And there were just a few of us
                     carrying it out.

                  <p class="noindent">It was both national and local. And remember that not only did the membership drop out, but no new members— Well, maybe "no"
                     is an exaggeration, but almost no new members came into the guild. We had had guild chapters in law schools, which were a
                     source when people graduated. Many of the students who were in the guild chapters became guild members. During this period,
                     particularly after the attorney general gave the notice, the point was raised that students became afraid that if they belonged
                     to guild chapters, they'd have trouble getting admitted to the bar in various states. So the guild

                     law firm during that period needed— We lost some of the people, one or two of the people, who were with our firm. We were
                     looking for young people who were with our firm. We were looking for young people to go to work for us. There were a lot of

                  <p class="noindent">Well, to go on, it's rather interesting. This was a period during which if the word "communist" was mentioned in court, generally
                     speaking, that was enough: you lost your case. It really was that bad. Now, there was an exception. The exception— We won
                     most if not all of our cases on these local ordinances. But we did so, we succeeded in doing so because of several reasons:
                     One was that they were almost universally very badly drawn and wide open to attack on all kinds of technical grounds. The
                     main argument that we had was that these were matters of national policy, and that the localities had no authority to legislate
                     locally. So we were quite, quite successful on that. The result was that the litigation lasted over a period of a year, or
                     a year and a half, something like that. There was a proliferation of attempts to get these ordinances. My recollection is
                     that there was an attempt to get one or more of them in Los Angeles. Was a fight against it, and then when similar ordinances
                     were declared unconstitutional for the reasons I've given, it was abandoned. Now, whether it would have otherwise passed,
                     I don't know. But I do think that the victory in some of the cases, although they were on strictly technical grounds, it was
                     not— Or that the federal government had exclusive jurisidiction. Whether or not they would have passed otherwise, I'm not
                     sure. Probably would have.

                     were on—I guess, a [list of] local Los Angeles attorneys at that time. Is this something that you became aware of at the time?
                     Are you familiar with this particular episode?

                     some very interesting things about the ABA, if you want to know. [laughs]

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah, I would because I think the next question was the extent to which attorneys were threatened or felt harassed or felt
                     in fear of losing their bar cards and so on because of their political activities.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, you know, the ABA is <i>the</i> powerful, influential, recognized bar association of the United States, with all of the big firms having their people be
                     members. Oh, they were engaged in hundreds of activities. They're a big organization.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Back in the days of the guild, they had a rule that no one who was— Well, first of all, I think they always had a rule that
                     no one who was a communist could be a member. Then they adopted a rule that no one who was a member of the National Lawyers
                     Guild could belong to the American Bar Association. They also at that time didn't permit—they were lily-white—they didn't
                     permit any black or Asian members at all. As a matter of fact, the National Lawyers Guild was the first national nondiscriminatory
                     bar association that there was. It was one of the things that it prided itself on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Of course, in due course, I don't remember when, but during the civil rights movement, the ABA withdrew its restriction. I
                     don't know whether it was ever

                     </div>actually written into the bylaws of the ABA or just recognized. They began to admit black lawyers, and they admitted— And
                     now, of course, they not only don't discriminate, they actively seek members of all ethnic groups. And at times they have
                     done some pretty good work in the civil rights and civil liberties cases. They've had civil liberties committees, some of
                     which have taken very good positions. For example, when it comes to the Smith Act case, one of the people who was active on
                     this civil liberties committee was [Zechariah] Chafee, who was considered the expert First Amendment person. They conducted
                     a lot of very good activities.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But the interesting thing is that about five or six years ago, I got a request, or I got a form that was sent out to a lot
                     of lawyers, asking me to join the ABA and telling what a great organization it was, etcetera. So, I wrote a letter to the
                     president of the ABA and said that I'd never joined the ABA because it discriminated. I noticed that it no longer discriminated
                     against blacks, but that it had discriminated against members of the guild. And I was still a member of the guild and assumed
                     I was, therefore, not eligible to join the ABA. Very, very promptly, I got back a response, in which they said, "Yes, it's
                     true that there was such a time. That that was one of the errors, great errors we made. And we not only will accept you, but
                     we urge you and desire you to become a member of the ABA and to participate in its activities."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I have never really wanted to join the organization, but I'd gotten myself into a box, because I had written a letter which
                     in effect said the only reason I didn't join the ABA was for the reasons I stated. And they wrote me this letter and placed
                     me in a box. So I joined the ABA and continued my membership for a couple of years. And then dropped my membership for only
                     one reason really. And that was that I just didn't have any time to spend on ABA matters— or energy—at that point in my life;
                     and it was just a question of giving them

                  <p class="noindent">Then at our last National Lawyers Guild national executive board meeting, which was held in Portland a few months ago, they
                     had a speaker from it at the guild, coming from the ABA, from a section of the ABA: civil liberties, civil rights. And, who
                     was gung ho for everything on guild policy! Who came there saying that he was now made head of that section and, by god, he
                     needed help. He wanted members of the guild to come in and join his section of the ABA. Well, in order to join his section,
                     you had to first join the ABA, and then you join the section, like it's a suborganization. So I have again joined, simply
                     because he did such a good selling job and because I think it's wonderful that the ABA now has a section with that kind of
                     leadership. It shows you that the world does change.

                  <p class="noindent">During the McCarthy period, or even a period of time more broadly than that, what was the situation with the California bar

                     highlights. You know that every lawyer must be a member of the state bar, which is a state corporation. The state bar is totally
                     governed by its board of governors. The board of governors are elected by the membership—by the members of the bar, everybody
                     being eligible to vote—and they're elected from sections. For example, I think Los Angeles has either two or three members
                     of the board of governors, San

                  <p class="noindent">In addition it has what is known—and it's had ever since I have been a member of the bar—a thing called the [California] State
                     Bar Conference [of Barristers]. The State Bar Conference is composed of private bar associations. You see, the state bar itself
                     is a public bar association. Private associations, like the guild, and there are many of them: Los Angeles County Bar Association,
                     the Los Angeles lawyers club [Lawyers Club of Los Angeles], and there are various black lawyers clubs, there's a women's lawyers
                     club—all kinds. There are, well, at this last— I've just returned from a conference at which there were I think 576 delegates—get
                     delegates according to your membership—and I think 68 organizations, or something like that, in which the guild is one and
                     has been one all along. It's a very interesting organization.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Back in the McCarthy days, and I don't remember just what year it started, there were, in many states, laws passed regarding
                     loyalty oaths and membership in the bar. There was introduced, in California, proposed legislation, which would declare members
                     of the Communist Party ineligible for membership in the state bar and separate legislation requiring a noncommunist affidavit
                     for membership in the state bar. Now, the State Bar Conference meets once a year, the same time as the state bar convention.
                     It's three days, generally. The various organization members of the bar, and even individuals also, can offer resolutions.
                     There's a whole procedure; they offer a certain period of time in advance and so forth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We were members at that time. My recollection is that, initially, the first resolutions on the subject, and I don't remember
                     the year, were resolutions offered by other bar associations to the effect of supporting this legislation, the two bills that
                     I have mentioned. We carried on— The National Lawyers Guild really did a job of writing pieces, circulating them among the
                     lawyers, and got a

                     </div>lot of publicity and, at that State Bar Conference, defeated both resolutions by a fairly narrow margin. I don't remember
                     their numbers, but it would be something like 200 to 175, you know, somewhere in that area where it wasn't one or two votes.
                     There was a very substantial vote against us.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">At the following— For several following conferences (they are once a year), there were similar resolutions, and the guild
                     itself offered resolutions against these things. We carried that—every time, we carried our resolution, and the others were
                     defeated. In about two or three years, the organizations stopped introducing such resolutions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was one member, whose name I don't remember, a real— He was considered a kook by everybody, one of the real far-out-Right
                     guys, who had offered a resolution calling for the disbarment of all communist lawyers. The first year he introduced it— See,
                     there's debate. There was quite a debate on it, but it was decisively defeated. The second year and third year, the debate
                     was less, and it was even more decisively defeated. After about the third year, he would get up, make his speech for this.
                     Nobody else would speak. And it was just turned down overwhelmingly. It just became something that they wouldn't buy.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The guild, interestingly enough, has played an influential role in the conference, which is remarkable for the size of the
                     guild. We're generally in the center of the most controversial resolutions—I'll give you an example—and with varying degrees
                     of success, but generally over a period of time, a high degree of success. At this last conference— First of all, we generally
                     introduce the only social reso— Most of the resolutions, most of them, deal with technical things, amendments to the code,
                     and so forth, but some of them, policy matters, but policy matters in the legal, ordinary business, legal, and criminal area.

                  <p class="noindent">We had the following resolutions this time: First, we had a resolution
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">320</span> ―
                     </div>calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish the death penalty. It was placed on as the first order of business for unlimited
                     debate (sometimes they limit debate). It started in the morning, and there was a terrific discussion on that. Our resolution
                     carried by a vote of 375 to 212. Next, for many years, six years ago, we introduced our first resolution calling for some
                     kind of state action against South Africa as long as it maintained apartheid. We were defeated five years in a row, although
                     we kept getting stronger on the thing. We modified the resolutions in different ways. This year, the sixth year, we got the
                     support of the two major bar associations—two biggest bar associations—and won it quite overwhelmingy, after losing it for
                     five years.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We had a resolution urging each state bar association—each private bar association to establish a committee to work on the
                     issue of arms control. Quite a debate on that. The president of the Beverly Hills Bar Association stood up and said, "I want
                     to thank the guild for putting in this resolution. I am ashamed of the fact that I've been president for a year and haven't
                     thought of it myself. We should be doing it." By the way, on the argument on apartheid, several persons got up and said it
                     was to the state bar's shame that they hadn't done it earlier. This resolution on the arms, the committee passed by a large
                     vote.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Let's see, what else? We had several other similar—We had two or three other similar resolutions. We lost only one of our
                     resolutions, and that I think largely because of the political campaign. We had a resolution on Nicaragua, against the American
                     policy in Nicaragua, saying, "We should follow the rule of law, and obey the treaties." We had the support. We got quite a
                     lot of support. Then somebody made a speech saying this was merely a political maneuver to attack the Reagan administration
                     and we shouldn't be getting mixed up in partisan politics. In any event, the motion was tabled. I don't think they could have
                     defeated it, but it was tabled with about a 60 percent vote in favor of

                  <p class="noindent">Well, several things. The state bar, it is true, is made up of a very conservative profession, because so many lawyers represent
                     big business and their interests are largely oriented in that direction. However, there are many lawyers who defend criminal
                     cases, and developing concepts in that direction. There are other lawyers who handle—a lot of lawyers who handle personal
                     injury cases, domestic relations cases, where the predominant conservative thing does not control, because they're dealing
                     in personal relations. They're as often on one side as on the other, and they tend to want to be fair. So there are those
                     areas.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, in the area of civil liberties, civil rights, number one, there's been a tremendous growth of women lawyers, and they're
                     just terrific on the subject. There is growth of black lawyers and some Chicano lawyers, although they haven't played much
                     of a role. But more basic than that, lawyers learn the Constitution while they're in law college. And by and large, they believe
                     in the Bill of Rights, particularly where it doesn't come into conflict with their own financial interests. When it does,
                     then it may be a different story. But where it doesn't they tend— They're split, but they tend to be pretty good on those
                     issues.

                     </div>for several reasons: the other bar associations, while they have these tendencies that I've described, nevertheless don't
                     have a deep concern about the issues that we're concerned with. In other words, the very lawyers who will vote with us on
                     an apartheid resolution because they think that's the right thing to do in this sort of thing, it isn't central to their interest.
                     Therefore, they tend not to introduce resolutions on the subject, but will often support resolutions on the subject introduced
                     by others, and those others are the guild. Now, in addition to that, the guild generally prepares very carefully. They're
                     very concerned. If somebody gets up and does a poor job in support of our resolution, does an unprofessional, unworkmanlike
                     job, even on issues they agree with, they look down on those people. If you do a good job, they respect you, even if they
                     disagree with you. And the guild, not always but most of the time, does a very good job. So for all of these reasons we got
                     support. On the other hand, if we were to introduce a resolution, let us say, on the antitrust laws, that we think would be
                     very good, we very likely wouldn't be supported. But that is not our main concern.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, we're about to embark on a pretty lengthy discussion of the Smith Act cases. Perhaps the best thing for me to ask you
                     to do would be to give an overview of what had happened in this area, before the cases that you were personally involved in
                     began.

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, the first Smith Act case against the Communist Party and its members was the so-called <i>Dennis</i> case, <i>Dennis</i> v. <i>United States,</i> in which the top fifteen, I believe, I'm not sure of the precise number, national Communist Party leaders were indicted and
                     tried in New York City. I did not directly play any part in that case, although I sat in on a number of conferences concerning
                     various matters relating to the case. I was back in New York on several occasions and sat in two or three times at various
                     sessions of the case. I had nothing to do with the handling of the <i>Dennis</i> case.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I think there are a number of significant points about that case that should be noted. Perhaps the most significant one is
                     that the defendants there took a position that is unusual in a case, in any criminal case. That is, they were all— The defendants'
                     position was we're all in the same boat. We're all communist, and we're all innocent or we're all guilty. Of course, they
                     took the position that they were all innocent, but they did not— Not only did they not take the position that the guilt of
                     each individual had to be proved, they took exactly the contrary position: that they were all together; they all stood for
                     the same things; they'd all done the same things; and that therefore it followed that they were all innocent or guilty. I
                     think that was one of the major factors that led to the result in which all of the defendants were [convicted].
                  </p>
                  
                  <hr class="pb">
                  <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">324</span> ―
                  </div>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I have read parts of the records. There were some differences, some substantial differences in testimony, with respect to
                     some of the defendants. It is conceivable, although I certainly don't know, but it is conceivable that the court might have
                     made a distinction among the defendants, and found some innocent and others guilty.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The second factor is that there was a relationship between the attorneys and their clients, in that case, of this kind: The
                     clients said, "This is a political case, and we're going to make all of the decisions. Because the decisions really are not
                     legal decisions, even though they may take a legal form. They are political decisions." The attorneys primarily were following
                     the tactics and the procedures and the policies that had been outlined by their clients. And to a major extent had little
                     to say about what those were, although from time to time they were consulted. Also, there was a deliberate decision to give
                     as good as they got from the judge.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They had a judge who was terribly biased and sometimes very crude in the way he handled the matter. The attorneys stood up
                     and reacted to it, as I believe they had a right to react. Did so, and one of the principal issues in the case was—permitted
                     to become—how the attorneys were conducting themselves in handling the trial. In other words, they were being tried not only—
                     The defendants were being tried not only for what they allegedly did, but also for the manner in which they defended themselves.
                     This of course hit upon the attorneys and resulted in contempt convictions of all of the attorneys. I participated in the
                     writing of one of the briefs, the brief for Richard Gladstein. I read all of the other contempt briefs, and I think helped
                     in some of them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Let me say that the conduct of the attorneys there was much, much more defensible and not subject to contempt than was, let's
                     say, the conduct of the attorneys in the Chicago Seven case, where I also worked on their contempt

                     </div>brief and read major portions of the record. But the Chicago— But the political conditions were different and the Chicago
                     Seven attorneys were all finally acquitted on appeal of their contempt, whereas all of the contempt charges for the Smith
                     Act attorneys stood up; that is, stood up so far as the holdings of the court were concerned. I think these two factors had
                     a major impact upon the result. I'm not at all sure. Well, if I were to make a guess, I would say that no matter how the case
                     was handled—how well it was handled and how correctly it was handled—and how much attention was given to public relations,
                     in the political situation that existed at that time, a conviction at least of some, and probably of all, of the defendants
                     was a certainty. However, I do feel that the matter was handled in such a way as to make it easiest for the government to
                     accomplish its objectives and as to, I think, be somewhat harmful in the field of public opinion, which in the long run is
                     very important in these cases, precisely because they are political cases.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, the attorneys were all friends of mine. The judge was [Harold R.] Medina, who was a very able man, a vicious man, who
                     simply rode the attorneys to an extent that is almost unbelievable. And I've never seen anything to equal it, except, again,
                     in the Chicago Seven case, where the judge did very similar things. He really started the things that were called contempt,
                     and the attorneys stood up and fought back. What they were doing by and large— And some of it was perhaps almost politically
                     necessary from the standpoint of the people involved. For example, the attorneys noticed that every day about three thirty,
                     I think it was, whatever the hour was, the judge would make some remark that was bound to find its way into the press. He
                     would wait until that precise hour to make a remark. It was obvious that it was planned and timed for purposes of the press,
                     at least obvious to counsel. And

                  <p class="noindent">From Philadelphia, what's his name? I can't think of it at the moment, but it will come to me. The other attorneys were Richard
                     Gladstein from California, who was a former law partner of mine when I practiced law in San Francisco; Abe [Abraham J.] Isserman,
                     who was a New Jersey and New York attorney, who was the only attorney disbarred as a result of this contempt proceedings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Interestingly enough, he acquired a unique position in legal relationship to the courts. You have to be a member of the lower
                     courts in order to be a member of the Supreme Court of the United States. Abe had been a member of the Supreme Court of the
                     United States for a long time and admitted to practice there. He was then disbarred from all of the lower courts, and a motion
                     was made to disbar him from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, which had sustained his contempt conviction, nevertheless
                     refused to disbar him. I think he's the only attorney in American history who has been a member of the U.S. Supreme Court
                     and no other court. Let's see, others were— Abe had been an attorney for the [American] Newspaper Guild. All of the attorneys
                     were guild members, that is Lawyers Guild members. He had been the attorney for the Newspaper Guild and a lot of left-wing
                     things.

                  <p class="noindent">There was David Scribner, also a very, very able attorney, who had been an attorney for the United Electrical [Radio and Machine]
                     Workers [of America (UE)], national counsel for the United Electrical Workers. Let's see, how many is that? Oh, George [William]
                     Crockett [Jr.], who was a black, young black lawyer; he was by far the youngest member of that team. He was later elected

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. Let me ask you sort of two questions really, which maybe make sense to be answered together, which is when the indictment
                     first came down in the <i>Dennis</i> case, first of all, how seriously did the— In the midst of everything else that was going on with HUAC [House Committee to
                     Investigate Un-American Activities] and so forth, I realize, how seriously did the Communist Party take this? Also, on what
                     levels of the party was the strategy to deal with this new assault on the organization discussed and what types of discussions
                     went on?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, as far as the <i>Dennis</i> case was concerned and all of the other Smith Act cases are concerned, they were all taken with the utmost seriousness as
                     an attempt to destroy the Communist Party, which indeed it was. It was discussed everywhere—top levels, everywhere. But the
                     policies for the <i>Dennis</i> cases were made by the defendants in that case, who were of course the top leaders of the Communist Party.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I should mention one other thing of significance about that case. The case was defended as it should have been, indeed, basically
                     upon the theory that the Smith Act [Alien Registration Act, 1940] on its face, and as applied in that case, violated the First
                     Amendment. The evidence against the defendants consisted entirely of elements of speech: it included writings of course, which
                     also fall under the First Amendment—teaching and advocacy.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The law, as it stood prior to the decision in the <i>Dennis</i> case, was that you could not declare speech illegal, unless it was so closely connected to action that there was no time
                     to reply and that there was an immediate evil that the law had a right to prevent that was flowing from, would flow from the
                     speech, directly
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">328</span> ―
                     </div>from the speech. Like, you know, the classical example of somebody hollering "fire" in a theater, or when you have a lynch
                     mob and somebody gets up, they pick up the black there, and somebody says, "Let's lynch him!" That kind of speech was considered
                     so closely related to action as not to be protected by the First Amendment.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But anything short of that, no matter how illegal even the objectives were, could not be punished. For example, it had been
                     held by the Supreme Court, in a leading case, that the advocacy of bigamy by Mormons, that the advocacy of multiple marriages
                     and of bigamy by Mormons was not a violation of the First Amendment, unless it was shown that it was part of the process of
                     accomplishing that objective. Well, there was no such showing, of course.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The charge here was the defendants conspired to advocate the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and
                     violence, as speedily as circumstances would permit. Well, no showing could be made—nor was there an attempt to make a showing—that
                     the country was on the verge of revolution and there was an immediate danger that the speech would result in violent overthrow
                     or an attempt to violently overthrow the government.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So, the courts were faced with this dilemma. How do you deal with this question? They devised a new rule, which modified the
                     First Amendment. As a matter of fact, took the heart out of it, in which they said that if the ultimate objective was illegal—overthrow
                     of the government by force and violence—then you would have to consider the question of immediacy in relationship to the seriousness
                     of the violation of the law. In other words, the more serious the violation, the more remote the impact of the language could
                     be. And here, of course, you had a situation where there was no showing that at any time there was any such danger. Nevertheless,
                     the Court by fashioning that rule was able— The Supreme Court was able to sustain the convictions. Otherwise, it
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>could not have done so. It's an indication of what I said before, that almost regardless of what anyone did, there was going
                     to be a conviction in that case.
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Now, just to catch the flow of the history of the Court for a moment— And obviously we'll be talking about the <i>Yates</i> decision later [<i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>] that finally came out of the Smith Act cases. I take it that the state of the law before the <i>Dennis</i> case was that the advocacy had to be immediately tied to an illegal action in order for it to be outlawed. The <i>Dennis</i> case would then represent—
                  </p><br>

                     and present, the danger has to be. It doesn't mean that the illegal act has to have occurred. For example, if you shout "fire"
                     in a crowded theater and there isn't a mass rush to the exits, nevertheless, the shouting of the "fire" would be illegal,
                     because it would create that clear and present danger.

                  <p class="noindent">There were no second indictments until the <i>Dennis</i> case. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Shortly thereafter, the second New York case was started.
                     That case involved the secondary echelon of the top national leaders of the Communist Party, located in New York. And, by
                     the way, John [T.] McTernan, my partner, was asked to, and went back and handled the defense of that case. Shortly after the
                     New York-case indictment was handed down, the Los Angeles case was handed down—indictments were handed down. It made sense,
                     because out here in California was the largest segment nationally of the Communist Party—New York of course was the center—and
                     the Los Angeles case included the top California leadership. Not just the Los Angeles top leadership, but basically Los Angeles
                     and the Bay Area, San Francisco and Oakland.

                     that they were going to proceed with additional cases. It just made absolute sense that an early case would be the Los Angeles

                     help. But the first thing to be done, of course, was to make an application for bail. Immediately, I remember, I went to the
                     U.S. attorney's office and got a copy of the indictment, or was able to read it if I didn't get one. And then I went back
                     to the office and began to work on a bail application—get a motion for release on bail.

                  <p class="noindent">I also called around to a number of lawyers, trying to get someone to associate with me, at least on the bail application
                     at that time. I was looking particularly for some lawyer or lawyers who were less labeled than I and the people in my office
                     were, to try to give the defense some breadth, particularly the application for bail. I remember I called a number of lawyers.
                     With one exception, at the moment I don't even recall who they were, but for very good reasons I will always remember the
                     one whose name I do recall. His name is Dan [Daniel G.] Marshall.

                     and they were active in various progessive causes. I don't think I would define him as Left, although maybe a lot of people
                     would. But he certainly associated himself— and Dorothy, his wife, had associated herself—with various kinds of particularly
                     civil liberties and civil rights causes. He was with a moderate-sized law firm, whose practice consisted primarily of representing
                     various governmental bodies. But, you know, there are many, many communities around, small communities, many of which do not

                     reasonably well in that kind of practice. I called him. He said that he just didn't see how he could do it. He didn't think
                     that the members of his firm would stand for it. That he really wanted to help, but he was going to think about it, and he
                     would get back to me.

                  <p class="noindent">As I say, I got no indication of even a possibility from several other attorneys that I called, that they might be willing
                     to participate. The fear was just pervasive. So, I went to work to prepare the motion. Did some research, prepared a memorandum
                     of points and authorities, and either the next— Well, the arraignment came up, I think it was a couple of days later, and

                     take some evidence, and the government took the position that there should be no bail. But if there was bail, it should be
                     very high. They had some arguments. There had been, following the <i>Dennis</i> affirmance on

                     this was the beginning of perhaps the establishment of fascism in this country. They wanted to have an underground movement
                     to resist fascism. And, by the way, Ben Dobbs had been one of those who'd been underground, but had come out during this thing.
                     So they had the fact that there had been— Thompson had not responded. They said that the defendants are so close to San Diego
                     and to the border that it's easy for them to escape into another country—there's a high risk of their escape—and that they

                     called Leo Gallagher, who had been a former partner of the firm (I think, if you may remember, when we first came down here).
                     And had him testify about democratic centralism, what it meant, and that the party adhered to democratic centralism: that
                     democratic centralism meant that while the people at the bottom could discuss, make suggestions and arguments, that the final
                     decisions were made at the top, and were binding upon all members of the party. At the same time that he testified to this,
                     he also said that these arrests were an outrage and a violation of the Constitution. This is perfectly consistent with Leo
                     Gallagher's thinking. The kind of thinking that caused us to break with him, when he took the position that the Communist
                     Party members should testify before the grand jury that they were members, and just refuse to give names and go to jail. Except
                     you stand up and tell the truth under all circumstances, and that's the best way to fight. So that he actually became a

                     In any event, the judge finally set bail at $100,000 apiece, which at that time meant $1,400,000. A lot more money in 1950,
                     '51 than it is now. Probably like $14,000,000 today. There was just no way that that amount of money could be raised, or that

                     I believe, Justice [William O.] Douglas. I hung around for, I believe, a day or so. Finally, received a call from the clerk,
                     who said, "The justice will not see you. You might as well go home." So I immediately got a plane. I went immediately to Chicago.
                     It so happened that there was a National Lawyers Guild convention going on in Chicago at that time. I stopped over there for
                     a day, I believe. Couldn't stay for the whole convention because of too much to do, and then I flew home.

                     here for you. They want you back in Washington." The telegram had come in that morning, but I had been in Chicago. Well, that
                     evening I was on the plane. I immediately turned around, went back to the airport to catch the first plane out for Washington,
                     and was up all night.

                     What had happened is that Douglas had referred it to the entire Court, and the entire Court had set it for argument. I think
                     it was two or three days away, but when— I had not anticipated that there would be argument before the entire Court. That

                     the plane all night. Next morning, started going around [to] the various Washington lawyers to try to get them to participate.
                     I got the thing "I can't do it, it's— I would lose my practice." Some of them said, "I wouldn't do it as a matter of principle";

                     very sympathetically by the Court. Got a very good reaction, and, by god, I left the argument feeling we could have a chance.
                     I had really thought we had no chance. And oh, surely enough, in two, three weeks— It was a very short period of time. I don't
                     remember exactly how long, but for a decision from the Supreme Court, it was very quick.

                     The Ninth Circuit in turn sent it down to the trial court—Judge Mathes—and another bail hearing was set before Mathes. Because
                     under the Supreme Court's order, it was up to him to set bail in accordance with the decision.

                     its request for $100,000 bail apiece. And sure enough, Mathes said, "I've reconsidered, and the bail is $100,000 each. I've
                     followed the rulings of the Supreme Court." And so I filed another petition to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit considered
                     the matter. Ruled that Mathes had not followed the order of the Supreme Court and sent it back to him again. And we had another
                     hearing before him. And for a third time he set it at $100,000 apiece.

                     a week, two weeks. I don't remember how long on problems relating to the bail, which if you want to hear, I'll tell you about

                     people to get them to put up bail. Some people wanted to put up property. Some people put up cash and so forth. We submitted
                     that to the court.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The court then did a very unusual thing. It ordered a hearing and said, "I want all of the people who are contributing this
                     bail to attend. I want them to testify." He called the people, and he said, "Got to establish that they're the
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">347</span> ―
                     </div>ones, and that they're willingly and without directions from anybody putting up this money."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They so testified. Then the court would cross-examine them. Would say, "You know these people are charged with being communists?
                     You know that there's a danger that they'll go to Mexico? You know that you'll lose your bail if they do?" And that kind of
                     thing, go on and on and on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Without exception, they all said, "We don't believe that they will disappear. We have confidence that they will appear, and
                     we want our bail to stand."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">After several days of hearings, as I recall, he finally approved the bail. And then they were finally released after approximately
                     five months in jail. But, again, serving their time under very unusual conditions. Because while Mathes was, as I've indicated,
                     just totally arbitrary and unforgiving, you know, just totally unwilling to modify his position at all on the issue of reducing
                     the bail, he in certain other respects acted not too badly.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Let's see, there are two incidents, I think. One is— Well, let's stick to the bail. No, the bail— I think the bail is behind
                     us. Well, one of the arguments that we made, when we were asking for bail, was that we had the fourteen defendants, that they
                     were charged with a conspiracy, and that it was necessary for the attorneys to work with them collectively. You know, when
                     you go to visit them in jail—attorneys, of course, visit—it's a one-on-one proposition. Also that the defendants had to have
                     access to various books, a big library of Marxist works and things. And that it was just impossible, we were being deprived
                     of the opportunity to prepare the case. We really made a very, very strong showing in that regard.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So Judge Mathes made an order. He ordered that each morning the defendants would all be taken across the street from the county
                     jail to a cell in the federal building, which was quite a large cell. In which all fourteen and their

                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">348</span> ―
                     </div>attorneys could be a little crowded, but there was room for them all, for tables and so forth. Be equipped—that they be given
                     the things that they needed there. That they be allowed to remain there all day until dinnertime and then be taken back. That
                     their attorneys would have open access to them, to come and go as they please, and this is five days a week.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">One of the problems that arose immediately was that they couldn't serve them lunch over there. So the judge said— We said
                     we were willing to have food brought in from the outside. The judge said fine. Ordered that they permit food for lunch to
                     be brought in every day. And this is— Committees of women were set up. The Communist Party, women or friends of the Communist
                     Party took turns preparing the lunches. For about five months, five days a week, every day, lunch was served. I tried to be
                     there as often as possible for that lunch. I'd never seen such food in my life. [laughter] These women just absolutely broke
                     their necks with the greatest kind [of] delicacies and meats and salads and desserts. None of the defendants had ever eaten
                     like that in their lives! [laughter]

                     They were vying with each other for the opportunity to bring the lunches up. I spent a lot of time in that cell working with
                     them and also eating lunches.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So that we were able really to— In a way, from the standpoint of preparation, it worked out awfully well. Because the defendants,
                     who all would have been doing twenty thousand other things— If they had been out, there would have been a problem always to
                     get to them. They were there. There was no place they could go. [laughter] There was nothing else they could do. They're

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In a way, Mathes, from a standpoint of preparation, Mathes did us a favor. It really worked out that way. Also, the time served
                     was not that terrible then. Of course, they had the weekends which they had to spend in the [jail] and eat the lousy jail
                     food. But some of them said that by the time Saturday arrived, they were so full of food, they couldn't eat anyway. [laughter]
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In fact, now there was another interesting factor in that. There was one deputy marshal who was placed in charge of it, every
                     day, when we're there. Big hulk of a man. When we first went over there, he was kind of brusque and, you know, sort of an
                     attitude, "These goddamned communists." Kind of a thing that you would expect from a marshal. [knock on door, tape recorder
                     off]
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The defendants had talked to him in a nice, friendly way, and he gradually changed. We reached a point where, within a month
                     or so, <i>anything</i> we wanted he would break his neck to get for us. We were honored guests as far as he was concerned. When the defendants were
                     released and left, he virtually cried. He said he was not going to work any more as a marshal. He was resigning. I think that
                     he probably— He was an older man. I think he was probably eligible for retirement. But I never saw anything like this happen
                     in my life. He just became so fond of the defendants; he would do anything in the world for them.

                  <p class="noindent">Not that I know of. It's the sort of thing that under different circumstances one might have followed up on. But we were so
                     harassed and so busy with the problems that we did not follow up with it.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. The question was when the case should be set for trial. I was making a motion for more time. I told the judge that I
                     was trying to get additional counsel, had not yet succeeded in getting them, what the problems were, and also that we were
                     short of money. That I had received a small amount of money, which had been utilized for costs, but we needed to get some
                     money for attorneys' fees and other things. And that I needed the time in order to be able to present an adequate defense.

                  <p class="noindent">He said, "You say your office has received certain funds. How much have you received?"</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "I don't recall, but it's in our books. In any event, that's privileged information." He said, "No, it's not privileged.
                     You produce your books. I want to see what funds you've received and what you've spent the money on."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "We've spent most of it." And I said, "Well, this will reveal the nature of our defense, what we're doing to prepare.
                     And it's privileged; you have no right to go into that."

                  <p class="noindent">He got very angry, and he said, "You will produce those records, or you will be in contempt."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">At that point, I was about— He was absolutely wrong. He had no right to see these things.</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">One of the defendants, I think it was Al Richmond, stood up and said, "Your honor, may we talk to Mr. Margolis before this
                     goes any further?" The judge said yes. Gave him permission to talk.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They gathered around—we gathered around, and they said, "Why are you refusing to give them to him?"</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "They have got <i>no</i> right to them".
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">"Is there anything in there that <i>really</i> we're too concerned about him seeing?"

                  <p class="noindent">I said, "Not really, I don't think—" You know, there was this, and what I said was the truth. "No problem."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They said, "Look, we've got enough to fight about. We don't want our attorney fighting for his own contempt. Let him have
                     the books."

                  <p class="noindent">So I got up and I said to the judge that while I believed he had no right to the records, my clients insisted that I make
                     them available, and accordingly I would. The interesting thing that happened is I brought them in the next day. Brought them
                     in to him and said it's on pages so-and-so. He opened the book, must have looked at them ten seconds, closed them up. That
                     was it! No contempt. He was looking for a way at that point of getting me held in contempt.

                  <p class="noindent">Not with him. There was another proceed— I think I told you about other contempt proceedings. No, he never— As a matter of
                     fact, although his rulings on the law were terrible and he was very gruff and sometimes arbitrary, he gradually got less so.
                     During the jury trial, as far as his conduct towards counsel was concerned, talking about the correctness of his rulings,
                     he was pretty good with most people. He threatened Leo Branton [Jr.] once for contempt. I forget what the circumstances were.
                     Leo Branton talked back to him a couple of times, and he didn't like that. But, by and large on relationships, personal, they
                     weren't that bad.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As a matter of fact at the conclusion of the trial, he did a rather strange and deliberate thing. Very often, a trial judge
                     will congratulate counsel on both sides for how well they conducted the trial and so forth. At the end of our case, he congratulated
                     counsel for the defendants on how well and ably they had represented the defendants. Didn't mention the prosecutor. Did— They
                     had done a stinking job, and he was really making a point of it.

                     arguments. He enjoyed himself when a good legal argument was being made. You could see that he relished it. He liked to engage
                     in exchanges, and I'm talking about the kind of exchanges that are normal: the questions, without, you know, riding the attorney,
                     but arguing with him. He loved that, and he did a lot of that. He felt that we were very well prepared and did our job very
                     well, as indeed we did. He respected us for that, and it showed in his conduct.

                     cases. One thing I wanted to ask you about was, as we begin to get closer to trial, how were Leo Branton, Jr., and the other
                     attorneys who worked with you on the case recruited into the proceedings?

                  <p class="noindent">Right at a very early stage, it was decided that we needed a staff of trial lawyers. We aimed at and ultimately secured six,
                     with the object, a twofold object: One, it was too much work for any one lawyer to do by himself. And two, we wanted to get
                     as broad and as representative a group as possible. So, one of the things that was raised was whether there should be a Northern
                     California lawyer included, in as much as a number of the defendants were from San Francisco and Oakland. It was decided on
                     asking a lawyer from my old firm in San Francisco, Norman Leonard, and he agreed to participate in the trial. With respect
                     to Leo Branton—

                     Leo Branton was a young black lawyer, who had only I think two or three years of experience behind him, but who had handled
                     successfully, as I remember, a rather difficult case involving a black soldier. I don't remember the details of that case.
                     I don't remember how we contacted, but I sat down and had a long talk with him. And was very much impressed by his really
                     extraordinary ability, particularly with the little experience that he'd had. He's a brilliant speaker, and also he was very

                     to come in.

                  <p class="noindent">Then, I think Al Wirin of the ACLU volunteered, as I recall. Came along and said he would like to be one of the trial counsel.
                     So an agreement was reached that he would be.

                  <p class="noindent">We had tried several other counsels. Our main idea originally was to get as much breadth as possible. You understand that
                     at that time there was so much hysteria. You start out with not two strikes against you, but three strikes against you. Just
                     an almost impossible situation. We therefore deemed it as important to try to lift that curse from the case. So we got— We
                     lined up a very prominent Oakland attorney, originally, by the name of Sullivan, who was a— Got a lot of publicity. [coughs]
                     I went up to Oakland to talk to him, and he was anxious to come on. He's sure; this was just his kind of challenge. Then he
                     came to one or two preliminary hearings and then just disappeared. Never showed up again, wouldn't return calls—nothing.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, he'd entered an appearance, and he just never showed up. I don't remember how we worked that aspect of it out, but obviously
                     we didn't want to have anybody forced to be on it. There was another difficulty in getting counsel, and that is that there
                     was very little money available. While money was being raised—and ultimately each of the attorneys got, I think, $10,000 total—the
                     lack of money was also a problem, but not nearly as serious a problem as the political scene. We had several other turndowns.
                     There were a lot of people that wouldn't even talk to me; they didn't even want to discuss it. We discussed it with Bob [Robert
                     W.] Kenny, as I recall, who had been attorney general and was in private practice at that time. Bob said, well, he would be
                     willing to do it, but he really wasn't a trial attorney. He would prefer not to do it,

                  <p class="noindent">We got a fellow by the name of Alex [Alexander] Schullman. We wanted some labor participation. Alex Schullman was the attorney
                     for the retail clerks and had a very substantial practice. A very odd kind of a guy, who turned out to be a nice guy. Courageous.
                     I'll tell you a little bit more about him later, but who turned out to be [laughter] the strangest guy as a lawyer that I
                     have ever run into. He used to stand up and make an argument before Judge Mathes. Judge Mathes would look at him quizzically,
                     and all of us would look at him. We didn't understand what the hell he was saying most of the time. And he, he was an orator,
                     you know, on that kind of thing. But he was devoted and he— When it came to preparation, he said he didn't need preparation,
                     that he was able to go in and play it off the cuff. So it ended up with our trying to minimize the role that he played, but
                     he did stay.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I want to give him credit for, you know, standing up [for] us. He lost his job. He lost his retainer with the retail clerks
                     and, I think, some other smaller unions that he represented. He never got them back. As a matter of fact, he was destroyed
                     by the case. Whether he would not have had problems anyway, I have no way of knowing. I was amazed as to how he could represent
                     the retail clerks. It's a big, big union. Anyway, he did and was in very solid there. Afterwards, he never got back into the
                     labor movement. He was a guy who didn't drive a car, and he went everywhere in taxis. He must have spent fifty dollars a day
                     on taxis, and he lived high. He always made a lot of money and used it up as fast as he made it.

                  <p class="noindent">After the case was over, he once came over and borrowed two or three thousand dollars from us. And then we never saw him again.
                     I think he was finally disbarred for taking a client's money. He was actually, actually destroyed by this case. And it's a
                     pity because he really made no substantial contributions

                     </div>to the case. And inasmuch as he was fired by his union, the idea that we had any breadth was hardly enhanced by that. So those
                     were the attorneys that we had.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The way we proceeded is that each attorney represented a different, theoretically represented different defendants; they were
                     divided. The practical matter was all tried together. We worked together and did that. The preparation— Oh, I must mention
                     one other thing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">At an early stage, I don't remember just when, it was decided that we needed an outside attorney. By that I mean an attorney
                     working outside the courtroom on legal research and all kinds of related problems. We were fortunate enough to get Sam [Samuel]
                     Rosenwein, who was not admitted in California, but who is an extraordinarily fine lawyer. He worked on the case from the beginning
                     right up to the Supreme Court. From an early time at least right up to the Supreme Court, and was of a— Made a tremendous
                     contribution to the case.

                  <p class="noindent">I, at an early stage, had some difficulties with Al [Wirin], but by and all we worked fairly well together. I just resented
                     the frequency with which he had to repeat that he didn't agree with the defendants, but that he defended their right to speak,
                     and their right to speak was violated.

                     We set up a separate office, however, for the handling of the case. It was quite an operation. If you want to ask me a question

                  <p class="noindent">Well, first of all, the defendants set up a committee to work with the attorneys—and that turned out to be during the pretrial
                     stage at least. Primarily me, because the other attorneys did not participate in pretrial preparation to the same extent that
                     I did. As I remember, Norman Leonard just came to Los Angeles shortly before the trial began. Now, he may have made two or
                     three trips for a day or two before that. Al Wirin was doing, for the most part, other things. Schullman, as I said, felt
                     he didn't need any preparation, and he was busy on other work. Who else? Did I mention everybody?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, in any event, I carried the main ball, working primarily with this small committee. And there were lots and lots of
                     what I would call political-legal problems to be worked out. There was a very close working relationship between the attorneys
                     and the defendants. In this connection, I might mention a very substantial difference between the way the New York cases were
                     handled and the Los Angeles case was handled, so far as the role of the attorneys was concerned.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In New York, the defendants decided virtually every, every question, and determined how it should be done. In some instances,
                     they even insisted that the attorneys write out questions that they were going to ask on cross-examination, and approved them.
                     The attorneys worked under— And the decisions were made very often without even any participation from the attorneys. It was
                     deeply resented by many of the attorneys. They felt that they couldn't—and indeed they couldn't—do their very best work under
                     those circumstances.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The situation in Los Angeles was the direct opposite. Decisions were made jointly. Many of the decisions had both— Virtually
                     all of the decisions of major import had both political and legal connotations. We used to discuss them and work them out
                     and agree on how they should be handled. As a result
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>of that, I think that we, the lawyers, were in a much better position to try the case well than were the New York attorneys.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I think it reflected a difference in the method of work, generally, of the top leadership of the Communist Party and
                     of the leadership of the Communist Party in Los Angeles. The top leadership operated that way. They ran the organization that
                     way. They were the last word. They theoretically followed the principles of democratic centralism, but as a matter of fact
                     the centralism was overwhelming. And they were accustomed to simply making decisions. They also, in accordance with their
                     past practices, said that they were the defendants; they had the right to make the decisions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They considered, they looked at the case—and this is one of the differences between us—solely from a political standpoint.
                     They would say, "This is what we want done, and you find a legal way to do it," instead of discussing whether or not what
                     they wanted done presented legal problems, how those legal problems should be resolved, and how they would affect what they
                     wanted politically. It resulted, in my opinion, in some very, very bad decisions that were made in New York.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By the way, I'm not saying that the result would have been any different, because in those times the court, and everyone else,
                     was simply determined to get them. I don't know if there's anything that they could have done that may have changed the result.
                     But certainly the case could have been tried a lot better, and the Supreme Court put in a much more difficult position than
                     it was when it decided the case. Again, we're going into some of those questions later if you want to.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, the absolute major one where there was violent—not physically violent—very strong differences of opinion between the
                     West Coast and the East related to the question of whether guilt should be treated on an individual basis or whether the defendants
                     should go in and say, "We're all innocent, but we're all in the same boat. And if you find one of us guilty, you'll have to
                     find all of us guilty." That was the position they took in the <i>Dennis</i> case. [phone rings]

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, in New York they took that approach. The result of that was that any bit of evidence introduced against any single defendant,
                     which it could be argued was not admissible against the group as a whole, was rendered admissible as to all of the defendants.
                     So that while you might have had a little bit of evidence against one defendant and a little for another one and a lot for
                     another one, everybody had the sum total of everything against them that piled up.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And we argued. And what New York said, "This is a political decision. We stand this way because, by god, it's the party,"
                     they said, "that is being attacked, and we are going to defend it as the party. We're not going to permit them to separate
                     us from the party. And we are going to say, `You're going after the party, and we are the party, and this is the way it is.'

                  <p class="noindent">The argument from the West Coast was, number one, that was a sure way to make the worst kind of a record for the testing of
                     the questions; and number two, we didn't agree with it politically.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By the way, I didn't— I had forgotten one thing now that I wanted to say. I had mentioned how the East Coast functioned in
                     the political arena. The West Coast, which was under the leadership of Dorothy Healey, functioned very, very differently.
                     Although there was some of the business of final decisions being made by her, it was still very, very much more democratic
                     and very much more participation. So again, the approach to the case in the West reflected the difference in method of work.
                     And, you know, it was one of the basic things that ultimately led to Dorothy leaving the Communist Party.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In any event, going back to the position that we took, we took that you don't play into the hands of the opposition, the government,
                     by making it easier for them to get a conviction. You make it as tough as possible. In addition, we said we didn't think it
                     was right. What the government was contending was that the Communist Party was a single entity. Everybody in the party had
                     the same views, and everybody in the party did the same things and stood for the same things. We said, "Number one, it isn't
                     true. There are differences, as reflected, for example, [by] the differences in this discussion. From a political standpoint,
                     it isn't good to say that there are people on high who hand down a decision, and everybody's bound by it. We say the political

                     us an opportunity to present the case. Each individual can talk about—" At the outset, we thought several might testify, but
                     they did not; only one testified. But at the outset, each one could testify about his or her own beliefs, and they needn't
                     necessarily be the same. In other words, we wanted to show that this was an organization that had a certain set of principles,

                     although there was general adherence to the same basic concepts. We decided on this rather early in the preparation for the
                     case. It was communicated to some of the people in the East, and there were meetings in the East. They tried to change the
                     position that this was all wrong and we shouldn't do this. But we did stick to our guns, and the case was tried on an individual
                     basis. And it was this, by the way, it was this very thing that led to the acquittal of all the defendants. Otherwise, there
                     would not have been an acquittal.

                     forced to try the case the way they wanted to try it back there, agreed with our approach. And to the extent possible, he

                  <p class="noindent">Let me put it this way. They said they didn't weigh one against the other. They said political is determinative. It's the
                     way I put it to you first: Here's the political decision. Now, you try it according to that political decision and adjust
                     your legal tactics to that. They didn't, also, however, didn't, necessarily agree with our position as to the different effect
                     on the courts. Because they were taking the position [that] the decision is one hundred percent political, and it doesn't
                     make any difference what sort of a record you have. What you're doing, they said, is giving up a political position, and it's
                     not going to change what the courts do anyway. You only change that by changing the climate and the country and so forth.

                  <p class="noindent">We disagreed. We said that while it is true that in some cases—in many cases—the political might be determinative, also history
                     showed that it wasn't that cast in steel. There were opportunities. There were good decisions, and there were breakthroughs.
                     And that at least you had to present it to the court in a way which would make it more difficult for them to have the political
                     totally decisive. And what they were doing was making it very easy for the court to do that. That was the nature. But on the

                  <p class="noindent">That was one of the problems. I'll give you another one. At that time, the line of the Communist Party was that in the South
                     there was a right to secede and establish an independent black nation. They supported the idea of the establishment of such
                     a nation. Here out on the West Coast, the question was one on which people differed. Some of the people disagreed with the
                     position of the party on the grounds basically that this theory really imposed something on the black people that they themselves
                     didn't want. What the black people wanted was to stay a part of this nation and to get equality. That they didn't want to
                     be a separate nation, and that a separate nation might very well turn out to be a disaster for them, assuming it could be
                     accomplished. And the other was a question of self-determination. So it was a question of how that should be dealt with.

                  <p class="noindent">We finally, as I remember, resolved that by trying to stay away from it as much as possible. But if it arose, of saying, "Well,
                     that was what the final party line was, but there were differences, many differences within the party. And the position might
                     change." Sure enough, it did change, not very long after that. But that one got quite hot and heavy, too. You want to remember
                     that at that

                  <p class="noindent">I worked out with—how did we do it?—Oleta O'Connor Yates. It was decided that she would be the witness for the defense who
                     would present the political outline of the political positions of the party. I worked with her for weeks, just putting together
                     political theory and experience, things that had happened, and exhibits as to what the party had done. We ultimately did put
                     her on for— I think I had her on a direct examination for seven or eight days. And I think it was quite a job. Now, during
                     the course of that preparation, many times questions arose as to just how to handle a particular thing. Most of them escape
                     my mind now, but we often, Oleta and I, would discuss it. If we felt we needed some more input or we didn't agree, we'd go
                     back and discuss it with the committee. That happened a few times. At this moment I don't remember what the issues were.

                  <p class="noindent">There was quite a discussion on how to present the party's position on force and violence, which of course is a key element
                     in that. And there were— The precise formulation involved a lot of discussion and a lot of struggle, because when you started
                     looking at the party literature and the theoretical works—not so much Marx, but Lenin and Stalin—you found many different
                     formulations of the question. Of course, the formulations [were] very much related to time, place, and circumstances, as to
                     what the position was on violence, and that became our principal approach. That the question of violence— For example, that
                     the party would favor violence to overthrow an undemocratic government, like fascism, because there was no other way to do
                     it. But that it opposed violence as a method to change the system as long as there were democratic processes open and available.

                     How do you count people under these circumstances? Well, through the democratic processes, you count them at the ballot box
                     and things like that. But when you don't have them open, you can't make a count, so you try to do what you think most of the
                     people would like or want. Have to make that judgment. Questions like that were—you know, that I'm discussing in two or three
                     minutes here—were discussed for hours. Not because there was really much basic difference, but because preciseness of formulation
                     was felt to be so important. People very often tended to talk loosely about the things they believed in. So there was really
                     a great deal of detailed work on that.

                     To what extent was there an attempt—and if so, how successful was it—trying to involve the noncommunist or liberal or civil

                  <p class="noindent">Well, one thing was who were the witnesses against us going to be? There were two— They were divided into two basic groups.
                     The government had a stable of informers that went from trial to trial testifying and who had already testified. So, one thing
                     we did was we got the records, all of the material we could get, about those who we were almost certain would be testifying
                     in our case. We were right: they did come and testify. So we gathered all the material, outlined it, and prepared it for cross-examination
                     of all those witnesses. Now, that was a time-consuming task, but it didn't involve the kind of problems that the other group
                     did.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The question was who new are we going to see, who have not testified? What local people are we likely to see? There were discussions
                     about people who, it was thought, might be witnesses, both people still within the party and people who had left the party.
                     And then the decisions were made. Well, here are the most probable ones, and then there were attempts to gain information
                     about them: What were they doing now? Any signs that they have a lot of money? That was one of the indicia of informers, they
                     usually had extra money. And to find out as much about them as possible. So that was quite a time-consuming thing. I was much
                     less involved in those discussions. That was primarily the committee, but I was involved in some of them when it came to reaching
                     certain conclusions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then a third phase of the preparation, that was done very intensively, was a preparation of the law. We made, for example—
                     There were pretrial motions,
                     
                     <hr class="pb">

                     </div>a motion to dismiss the indictment and so forth. I worked closely with Sam Rosenwein on that, and I argued the pretrial motions.
                     We lost everything, but we got some decisions, opinions, from the court that were useful later on appeal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, another phase of it, which involved a lot of work, is you prepare [and] propose the instructions that you ask the judge
                     to give. We worked very intensively on trying to formulate instructions, frankly, which we thought that the judge would refuse
                     to give, but would increase our chances of getting a reversal. We did a lot of work on that.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I would say that those were the main areas of preparation: the theoretical preparation, the witnesses—two phases of that,
                     the law and— Well, I suppose related to the first phase that I talked about, because this was a trial of books—and we knew
                     from other trials what books were going to be put into evidence—there was a lot of work of preparation for quotes which we
                     knew that they would probably cite, of how to handle them and how to deal with them. However, I don't list that too separately,
                     because most of it was involved in my preparation of Oleta for her testimony, although not all of it. I think that covers
                     the heart of the preparation. There are a hundred and one little things, of course, constantly going on.

                  <p class="noindent">No, when Sam came out here, he was admitted to practice in New York. He was afraid that there would be problems if he tried
                     to get admitted here. So he worked as a lawyer, but doing the things that were legal for him to do, like the research and
                     the work there. But he did not appear in court.

                  <p class="noindent">During this period of time, lawyers with political backgrounds were— There were actually disbarment proceedings against them.
                     It's much easier to keep an attorney out than it is to disbar him. There are a number of cases that went to the Supreme Court
                     on disbarment on political problems, including one here, the <i>Koenigsberg</i> case.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So Sam felt, number one, he would certainly be asked whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party, etcetera,
                     questions that he was not prepared to answer. So rather than do that— As a matter of fact, Sam has never gotten admitted.
                     What happened is that he got so involved in various kinds of work that really didn't much require for him— He worked for many
                     years with Stanley Fleishman, and he argued many cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. See, he stayed admitted in New York; he
                     kept up his good standing in New York. He was admitted to appellate courts in the East and to the U.S. Supreme Court. So he
                     carried on his practice without ever getting admitted.

                     two, the defendants were followed around openly by carloads of FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] people—everywhere. No
                     attempt to conceal it, and so forth. It was if [we] went anywhere, there were just several carloads where we'd go. We'd go
                     to a restaurant. We got talking to them, and they were not unfriendly. They were just [laughs] doing a job. And we threatened—
                     Again, my memory, it's not clear. I know we started to prepare papers asking for relief against their following us around
                     all of the time. It was interfering with our preparation. It was annoying. And we either— They stopped it, at least the open,
                     apparent stuff. I'm sure that they kept a quiet surveillance on. But I don't remember whether we ever filed a motion or whether
                     we told them we were going to file it, and they stopped this procedure, which went on at least for several days. It might
                     have been a couple of weeks. It was a very annoying kind of thing. I don't know if I told you— We had a separate office for
                     the trial counsel, which was in the same building, but on a different floor from where our offices were. I found out afterwards
                     that our phone had been tapped.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I'll tell you how I found out. This leads me to another phase of the preparation that I left out. Initially, we thought
                     that we might put on some witnesses who might be able to testify in a way that would help us with respect to the activities
                     of the Communist Party. We ended up not doing that, not putting on any such witnesses, but we explored that and we called
                     a number of

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I called a man by the name of [Paul] Jacobs in San Francisco. He was an anticommunist guy who had been in the Communist Party
                     <div class="note">
                        <p><b>*.&nbsp;</b>Actually, he was never a member, but he was close to the organization at one time. —Ed.

                     </div> and who, we thought despite his anticommunism, might on the force and violence issue be a useful witness. I talked to him
                     on the phone and asked him whether he would be willing to testify and just generally what his approach was. Got a favorable
                     answer from him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Later on, we decided— The reason we decided not to use any witnesses was because we knew that the judge [William C. Mathes]
                     was going to permit the asking of names of others. And if there were no responses to the names, people were going to go to
                     jail for contempt. And we didn't see— We couldn't ask people to subject themselves to that. So for that reason, we didn't
                     put on several witnesses who we might otherwise have put on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Long after these events, I applied for my FBI file, and I got part of it at least. What it covered [was] part of the period
                     when I was counsel for the communists here on the Smith Act case [<i>Yates</i> v. <i>United States</i>]. There was nothing in those, then, which indicated in any way that my phone had been tapped.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I got a call from Jacobs one day. This is many years, many years later, maybe fifteen years ago. (Jacobs is dead now, by the
                     way.) He called me and he said, "You know that your phone was tapped when we did that?"
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "How do you know that?"</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And he said, "Well, they've got a report of my conversation with you, when I agreed to be a witness, in my FBI report. But
                     they don't say it was over the telephone, and you and I never met in person."

                  <p class="noindent">The fact is that we had never seen each other in person. Never met. And the only conversation we had, both of us knew it,
                     was taken over the phone. And they had this in his report. The <i>only</i> way they could have gotten it was by wiretap. And so, I at least have that evidence. As a matter of fact, I would have been
                     surprised if— We assumed our lines were tapped.

                     come up and see you and get a copy." And it just never happened. It was just postponed from time to time. It wasn't any urgent
                     thing. It was just a matter of curiosity and interest. I was very busy, very busy during those years, and finding out, period,
                     I never did.

                  <p class="noindent">Before we go on, I'd like to take this, at this point, to go over the Smith Act defendants with you and just discuss a little
                     bit about who they were. Some of them, of course, people like Dorothy Healey, Phil [Philip] Connelly, and others, are very
                     well known in their careers in the Communist Party, very well documented. But for others that's less so, and I think perhaps
                     it might be useful to simply go down and ask you to briefly describe the people. Not only who they were, but also, in relationship
                     to the Communist Party, anything else that comes immediately to mind about them, including the role that they played during
                     the trial, and so forth. So, I'm going to be going through them in just very arbitrary order. Let me just put the tape off
                     for a second. [tape recorder off]

                  <p class="noindent">Now, of course, originally fifteen people were arrested. Why don't we start off talking about the one whose case was dismissed,
                     Mary Bernadette Doyle.

                     the indictment, but I didn't really know her. She was a member of the party, of course. They

                     what they called it, but it was the committee for either Los Angeles or Southern California, similar to the national committee
                     of the party. All of the Los Angeles people were on that committee. She was on that. I don't know— She's still alive, by the
                     way. She became, during the thing, very ill, and the doctor said that sitting through a trial would kill her. We went through
                     a bad time with her, because she insisted on going to trial. When we raised the question with the judge, the government offered
                     to dismiss her out of the case in order not to delay the trial. The judge said that he was not going to delay the trial; that
                     he would grant a dismissal, but if she chose to ignore her doctor's orders and sit through the trial, that was up to her.
                     And we had long arguments with her about that, and she finally agreed. To go through, she felt— She very much wanted to be
                     a part of this trial, but I think it would have killed her if she sat through it.

                     [Healey] and Oleta O'Connor Yates were the two most influential people. Not by virtue of their position of authority, but
                     by virtue of their ability and the strength of their position. Bill, to a considerable extent, sort of took a back position,
                     not all of the time, but a great deal of the time. He was, during the trial, quite severely criticized by other defendants,
                     on the grounds that he didn't adequately play the kind of independent role that he should have. He didn't make the kind of
                     presentations that he should have. And he wasn't really a strong guy, did not play a strong role during the trial.

                     could. It was our— When I said that we looked at this as a legal case, we recognized it also as a political case; it was a
                     political-legal case. While decisions, we thought, had to be made taking the defendant's political views into consideration,
                     they also had to take the legal views into consideration. But there ought to be someone at the trial in a better position
                     to present political viewpoints at appropriate times than the attorneys were in a position to do. And he, being the chairman,
                     he was the logical person. I think he did hold the position of titular head of the Communist Party, and he was certainly the

                     at that either. But Dorothy is remarkable in that area. I think she [Yates] was considered by most of the people as the leading
                     theoretician in the group. There's no question that she was well versed fundamentally in Marxism and in the history of the

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, since we're going to begin talking about the trial itself next session, I'd like to finish off by asking you about a
                     very controversial episode in the history of the Communist Party, and that is concerning the prosecution under the Smith Act
                     [Alien Registration Act, 1940], apparently the first Smith Act prosecutions, which were against members of the Socialist Workers
                     Party, some point in the late forties. I don't have all of the details at hand here, but it's an episode in which, over the
                     years, the Communist Party has been often accused of supporting those prosecutions and siding with the government in the prosecutions
                     because of the political differences and Trotskyist political opinions of that group. What is your memory of that whole episode?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, I would say that the accusation is at least partially justified, if not completely, because part of it— My memory is
                     vague. I do know this for sure, that the Communist Party was asked to support the group and refused to do so. Whether or not—
                     I have doubt that the Communist Party actually called for their prosecution and conviction, but I may be wrong on that. My
                     recollection is that the Communist Party position was that they weren't going to help a group like this Trotskyite group.
                     In effect, it was what people said it was, but I don't think it was that clear and unambiguous. What was clear is, "We will
                     not support them," and this, of course, in my opinion was a reflection of the mechanical thinking. And, again, the decision
                     was made at the top level without any real discussion. And was a serious mistake, because it supported a flagrant violation
                     of the First Amendment. The Trotskyites, that's what they

                     the Communist Party should have opposed this.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, let me, however, set this in context, again, as I recall it. After all these years I could be wrong, but as I recall
                     it, this group was violently opposed—again I use the word "violently" not talking about physical violence—to the war effort
                     [for World War II], because they hated the Soviet Union so. They opposed the war effort, and of course the Communist Party
                     fully supported the war effort. This built up the tension between the two groups, and I think the position at that time was
                     everything— I don't remember whether it was while the war was still going on, or shortly after the war was over. It was around
                     in that period when at least either the war was on, or it was so on the edges of the war that it practically was going on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And you must remember, the Communist Party took a position: Everything for the war effort. For example, it supported the Japanese
                     internment. Everything. No matter what, they were prepared to do anything. So really, it isn't anything surprising that they
                     did this, and I think this was largely a reflection of that attitude. It rose out of that particular time and circumstances.
                     And I think that maybe, and perhaps even probably, under a different time and circumstances, a different position would have
                     been taken. But I don't mean by that that it wasn't wrong. I'm just trying to explain what lead, what I think lead to that.

                  <p class="noindent">Was there any dissension that you recall over that stance? For example, say, from the attorneys in the party, who might have
                     been in a position to see where that was going to lead.

                  <p class="noindent">I don't recall any. Out here in California, there was very little news about it. It was reported, and it wasn't a big deal.
                     And we were all involved

                     </div>in so many other things. I don't think, you know, I wasn't even familiar, personally, with the Smith Act at that time. I don't
                     think I ever read the Smith Act until the <i>Dennis</i> indictment [<i>Dennis</i> v. <i>United States</i>].
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You know that there's another thing that ties into what I have just told you. The Smith Act was passed, purportedly, as a
                     war measure. Its purpose, when it was passed, was to be directed against the enemies of the war, to undermine sabotage of
                     the war. And the Communist Party was in favor of anything that did that, but without really giving consideration to this language,
                     which at the time it was passed, was not thought of by anybody as being used in this manner. Of course, anyone with a little
                     perception and study should have known that that was going to be so.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But I want to remind you of another thing. That there was a period of time when the Communist Party of the United States,
                     under [Earl] Browder, took the position in the postwar period that there would be harmony between the Left and the Right,
                     and the labor movement would continue to prosper, and the class struggle would diminish. All of those things were accepted
                     by large segments of the Communist Party. There were some differences, but, for the most part, it was such a nice outlook
                     that everybody loved it.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, we've talked a great deal about the preparations for the Smith Act trial. I wonder if at this point we could pick up
                     entering into the trial phase proper.
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, I think perhaps it would be interesting to discuss the kind of a judge Mathes was. Mathes was as dedicated an anticommunist
                     as anyone would hope to find, or fear to find, anywhere in the world, who believed fervently in the position that he took.
                     Among other things, he was determined to try this case in a way that would—he believed and hoped—would make it even easier
                     to convict communists than the <i>Dennis</i> case had made possible.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, I can give you perhaps the primary example of this. The <i>Dennis</i> case had held or had approved instructions which stated that the First Amendment problems were met by requiring that there
                     be proved advocacy of the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence, calling for action rather
                     than discussing abstract doctrine of the desire or ability of that, and with the intent of accomplishing such overthrow as
                     speedily as circumstances would permit.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The government, as well as us, submitted instructions to this judge, which required the jury to find advocacy not only of
                     abstract doctrine, but of action to accomplish the violent overthrow of the government of the United States. He refused to
                     give our instructions, or in fact the government's instructions, which were offered by the government because he wanted to
                     try the case consistently with what the United States Supreme Court had held in the <i>Dennis</i> case.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Judge Mathes took the position that when it came to advocacy of overthorw

                     </div>of the government by force and violence, it was not necessary to advocate action. It was enough if there was an intent to
                     accomplish that end, and that, therefore, he was going to instruct the jury accordingly. This is a very, very unusual sort
                     of a position for a judge to take, where you have a set of instructions that have been approved, word for word, by the Supreme
                     Court of the United States, and where he himself insisted on saying that the Supreme Court required more proof than was actually
                     necessary. Of course, he was afraid— He was quite an able man. He had this absolute blind spot of anticommunism, which just
                     was irrational, but he was a pretty good lawyer. As the evidence went in, he saw that there was very little that could be
                     construed to be advocacy of action, as distinct from advocacy of an abstract doctrine. He wanted to get a conviction that
                     would stand up with even an inadequate record, and which would make— Which will lay the basis for getting convictions easier
                     and easier, virtually by proving membership in the Communist Party.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was another question on which he took an extreme position in order to keep it in the case. The Smith Act not only forbade—
                     Correction, Smith Act forbade not only advocacy of the kind I've mentioned, but organizing a party in order to advocate, for
                     the purpose of advocating, with all of the other additions. The question was what organizing meant. We asserted that organizing
                     meant organizing the— Forming, bringing into being. He ruled that it covered all, any kind of organizing activity. The importance
                     of that, among other things, was that there was a three-year statute of limitations. The Communist Party had been organized
                     much more than three years before the indictment, and therefore the organizing section of the indictment couldn't stand, unless
                     organizing was construed to mean carrying on organizational activities.

                  <p class="noindent">I cite these things at the beginning, although these things were really resolved at the end. You settled your instructions

                     guy that he was. On the other hand, he was very careful, or tried to be very careful, to make a record, so far as admission
                     of evidence was concerned, where we couldn't argue that we were not allowed to introduce evidence or to conduct cross-examination
                     that we were entitled, we had the right, to have. So that on the introduction of evidence, he really gave us, and on cross-examination,
                     he really let us have a fairly free hand, probably as free as any judge would have given us, so that we were able to make
                     a record of the kind that we otherwise would not have been able to make, and which helped us when we got up to the Supreme
                     Court. In the pretrial proceedings, Mathes had been tough and rough, and really had ridden counsel, sometimes pretty badly.
                     When the trial started, he completely changed. And again it was his determination— [interruption, tape recorder off] It was
                     his determination to make the kind of a record which he believed would stand up on appeal, so that during most of the trial,
                     he was really— With one or two exceptions when he lost his temper, particularly with Leo Branton [Jr.] on a couple of occasions,
                     he really acted quite decently and was fairly courteous to counsel. I think there was another factor that affected him. The
                     attorneys for the government were really pretty second-rate and did a very poor job. The U.S. attorney at that time was a
                     man by the name of [Walter S.] Binns, who later became a municipal court judge and never rose above that. I think he still
                     is a municipal court judge. And a fellow who became a bankruptcy judge later on, his name starts with a <i>K,</i> I can't think of his— But what they did really— Really, they did a pretty poor job, pretty poor job, and that made him angry
                     at them. While he recognized the fact that the defense was doing a good lawyerlike job, he had that peculiar situation: He
                     loved a good argument, and he really appreciated the quality of the work that we did, while at the same time he was determined

                     </div>that we should <i>lose</i> the case. That was a peculiar kind of a dichotomy. I think as a judge, he would have liked nothing better than to sit, in
                     case after case, with good lawyers arguing difficult points. In many other types of cases, he was a pretty good judge.

                     an out-of-town judge, and got it reduced to thirty days or something like that. But this is the kind of a guy he was. But,

                     of jumping ahead of the story. After the trial was over, he sat as a judge for a number of years, and I had quite a few cases
                     before him. He used to embarrass me, he treated me so well.

                     dead or dying. You know, he just was totally inconsiderate of counsel. I remember going there one day. Several attorneys had
                     asked for some time on some things—one because of a Jewish holiday, for example—and he refused them. I needed some time. And
                     I got up, I thought— Wondered what the hell is going on. I thought I'd try. I got up and I said, "Your honor, I need a little

                     that this was sort of his way of saying that he respected the defense's lawyers, and trying to show that. At the end of the
                     case, he very pointedly congratulated defense counsel

                     is if he wants to congratulate one side, he'll at least say something nice about the other side. But he didn't. A very stern
                     guy. He'd had a lot of domestic problems. He lived in a big apartment house on Franklin Street, pretty much by himself.

                  <p class="noindent">On one occasion— And this I was told, just no one had ever heard of it happening before. Most judges you can make an appointment
                     to see them, in chambers, with the other side, and take up something before them. He, no. Anything you wanted had to be in
                     open court. Not just with us in the Smith Act case, this was in everything. Another thing that happened was, on one occasion,
                     I raised a matter before him. I don't remember what it was about. He said, "This is a matter I think we can discuss in chambers."
                     We sat down and discussed it. He was very personally friendly. You know, this is the peculiar kind of guy he was. But his
                     hatred for communism and communists was— It was almost on the verge of insanity. It was so great, he was willing to do, just
                     do anything. And he lost all perspective.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, Ben, we had talked about the process that led up to the way that he gave jury instructions, which raises a question.
                     Had you defense attorneys at any point considered not trying the case before a jury? Or was there ever any question as to
                     whether you were going to have a jury in this case?
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Never any question. No, it wasn't even a matter— I don't think we even talked about it. As a matter of fact, criminal cases
                     generally, of any kind, you go for a jury. With almost any judge, even the best of them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In this kind of a case, there are two reasons why you go for a jury: One reason is whatever hope there is in a case like this,
                     it exists only with a jury. We knew with him that it would be a foregone conclusion. But much more important than that was
                     the fact that you can get grounds for reversal with a jury

                     </div>that do not exist if you have a court problem. Let me give you an example. He gave us erroneous instructions, and those erroneous
                     instructions were grounds for reversal. If we had tried the case before him and he had simply given wrong grounds for his
                     decision, then the court could say, "Well, we say his grounds were wrong, but his decision was right." But to do that when
                     you have a jury would be to deprive you of a jury trial. So you always ask for a jury trial. There was never a— I can't even
                     remember any discussion on the subject. It was so obvious. As far as the selection of the jury was concerned, that took a
                     very short period of time. [pauses] He allowed us to present questions to be asked of the jurors in writing. As I remember,
                     he did all of the questioning himself. Asked very, very few of the questions that we put, although he did ask some. That's
                     an area in which, at that time, the law was very, very bad. What he was doing— The <i>voir dire</i> of the jury was very restricted, and you had very few rights. Besides that, we knew it didn't make a hell of a lot of difference
                     with the kind of panels you have there. Most jurors would be subject to the anticommunist bug, and we would be in— That's
                     a problem we had to face.

                     that they're guilty?" Some such questions we asked, but— We spent a lot of time on it, on questions which we hoped would throw
                     some light on how the jurors thought. I just at this moment don't remember just how we did it then.

                     in such a way that we had a valid basis for an excuse for cause. We had a certain number of peremptory challenges. I do remember
                     this. We had a certain number of peremptory challenges, and he had authority to give us more. We asked for more, and he gave
                     us a few more. We utilized all of our peremptory challenges. But it turned out to be a rather unimportant part of the trial
                     as it went.

                  <p class="noindent">Many of the details of the trial I now have trouble recalling. I do remember that there were six attorneys and Schneiderman,
                     representing himself, for the defense. Each attorney represented, for the purposes of the record, several defendants that
                     were named. On the cross-examination, one attorney would be assigned, and most of the time it was me, to handle the overall
                     general cross-examination. Each of the attorneys otherwise would handle the cross-examination on matters relating to his client
                     or clients. If a client was mentioned— Let's assume that I was conducting the initial cross-examination and I was not representing,
                     let us say, [Rose Chernin] Kusnitz. The attorney who represented her would ask any questions directly related to her, so that
                     there was participation by all of the attorneys in this.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We also divided up, to some extent, the cross-examination of the stable, what we called the stable of informers. You know,
                     there were people who traveled the circuit, and we had a lot of their testimony. We had intensive preparation done by various
                     attorneys on members of this stable, so that one attorney would concentrate on a particular witness.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The issues that arose— There really weren't many issues on the presentation of the evidence, because the court was pretty

                     </div>us to cross-examine and to present evidence. Let's see, the evidence that was introduced, that they introduced, consisted
                     to a large extent of books and pamphlets. At the time, there were certain passages, particularly in Lenin's and Stalin's works
                     that you would find. If you had a dozen pamphlets, you'd find those same passages in eight out of the dozen, if not all of
                     the twelve. And these were some of the most violent-sounding kind of language. I remember, for example, what they would do
                     is pick up a pamphlet and read that language from the pamphlet. I'll tell you another thing about it in a minute, but they'd
                     read the language from the pamphlet. Then they'd pick up another pamphlet, quoting that same language, and they'd read it
                     again from that pamphlet: the same language. We offered to stipulate that it was the same language that they had read before.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was one passage that probably [was] read, and I don't think I'm exaggerating, read fifteen or twenty times. It happened
                     to be a passage about violent revolution. They started in the middle of a paragraph and ended in the middle of a paragraph.
                     This was in one of Lenin's works. It talked about the necessity of overthrowing the government, a government, a capitalist
                     government, by force and violence. There was another part of the same paragraph, which they kept reading over and over again,
                     which said, "However, in democratic countries where democratic channels are open, it is possible to achieve a revolution without
                     these things." Then it goes on, "But where it isn't there—" And then it was thunder and lightning and, you know, and— They
                     kept reading that over, and we would read the other language over each time. [laughter]

                     cabinet full of books that they read. The rest of their evidence consisted primarily of— They'd have outlines for example.
                     The way they'd get in this is they'd have a witness, and they would say, "I attended a Communist Party branch meeting, and
                     we had an educational. And here is the outline of the educational." And they'd have an outline. Usually the points on the
                     outline didn't prove anything, but they would have on the outline— They would cite sources and Lenin's <i>State and Revolution</i> and, you know, all of these books were cited, which were talking about specific times and specific things. Then they would,
                     on the basis of what was in the pamphlet, they would then read from the book. And the witness would testify, "Well, Ben Dobbs
                     was there, and he led the educational." They only— Rarely did they put into mouths of any of the defendants words indicating
                     an intention to overthrow the government by force and violence. Usually when they did, on cross-examination it was virtually
                     destroyed. So go ahead.

                     a question for the jury. On the other hand, once an objection is overruled, then the facts go in. So, in the arguments that
                     occurred before the court—and there were frequent arguments about the admissibility of evidence—we would argue other points
                     too, but the basic point was always the First Amendment point. The court would overrule the objection, and then they would
                     put in the evidence. And on the evidence, we could not cross-examine on whether the First Amendment applied or didn't apply,
                     we could only cross-examine on what they said and what was meant by it. So, as far as the evidence is concerned, we had no
                     alternative, except to show that what was being

                     off] We tried to show that what was being advocated was that the word "revolution" did not imply the use of force and violence,
                     although it might involve force and violence. And that, as a matter of fact, as long as democratic channels were open, that
                     the Communist Party and these defendants did not advocate the use of force and violence against the democratic government;
                     but only against a government where the democratic channels weren't opened, and where the only avenue for change was by overthrowing
                     the government by force and violence. That was the— And what we did in the cross-examination was to attempt throughout to
                     show that what they introduced as evidence was perfectly consistent with this position of the defendants. And I think to a
                     very, very considerable measure, we succeeded in doing that. Now, where do you want to go from here?

                  <p class="noindent">Okay. Well, there was, I guess, onward and upward. But there was one question that I did have for you, something you referred
                     to before. You said that Mathes would occasionally lose his temper with Leo Branton, Jr. What was that about?

                     He was from the South. He tried very hard to conceal it, and most of the time was not overtly a racist. But I think when other
                     counsel stood up and argued with him, he was able to take it better than when Leo Branton stood up and argued with him. That's
                     my feeling of what happened, although I think there may have been a couple of occasions when Leo got more vigorous on some
                     things than he thought was proper. But I think basically it was this racism, which was there. Which he was trying not to show
                     and which he didn't think he was showing, but which I think caused him to do these things. He never— He threatened Leo with
                     contempt once, I believe.

                  <p class="noindent">I think there is no question about that. Actually, you would have to say that from the standpoint of admissibility of evidence
                     and, for the most part, courteous treatment of counsel, you couldn't have asked for much more. We'd make an objection if we
                     wanted to argue. Most of the time, he would excuse the jury, and he would let us argue, sometimes very extensively. It really
                     was, from that standpoint, a pretty fair trial, conducted within a contest in which, in effect, he was taking the position
                     that if you were a member of the Communist Party, you were guilty of violation of the Smith Act. That was basically the position
                     he was trying to sustain.

                     enough, and that he wasn't vigorous enough when he did participate. So I don't know how Mathes would have reacted if Schneiderman
                     had been more vigorous and fought a little harder, but Schneiderman was rather withdrawn in his approach. You didn't get a
                     feeling that he was coming out there fighting, that he was angry about this. You just didn't get that feeling. It was afterwards
                     thought by many of the defendants that it was a mistake to have had him be the one, to be the one who would appear in <i>propria persona.</i></p><br>

                     me that here you have the entire top leadership of the Communist Party on the West Coast stuck in this trial all day, every
                     day for six months. What effect did this have (a) on the functioning of the Communist Party and (b) on these persons' ability
                     to make a living and support their families? What was the toll that this took on them, politically and personally?

                  <p class="noindent">Well, I think that during this six-month period, the Communist Party on the West Coast concentrated most of its activities
                     around this case. Many of the other activities that it would have ordinarily carried on were carried on only to a very limited
                     extent.

                     there were hundreds of people, many of them spending a large part of their time, some full-time, around the case. Considerable
                     money was raised, and I think money was raised sufficient to keep things going for everyone. The attorneys were each paid;
                     they were paid for the six months. Each attorney got $10,000, except I worked twelve months for it, [laughter] because I had
                     been going ahead six months before that. But each attorney got $10,000, and that alone, $60,000, at that time, was a lot of
                     money.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The organizational effort around the case was really quite a remarkable effort. We had a daily transcript. In other words,
                     each day we got, by about six o'clock, we had a copy of the day's proceedings. And we got one copy. The problem was that each
                     attorney really needed a copy in order to be able to work effectively. The defense set up an office, a separate office, [and]
                     a crew of volunteers. Each night, there would be 250, 300 pages of transcript during the day. Each night, the thing was retyped,
                     with copies for each attorney and a couple of copies for various other purposes. So that the next morning at eight o'clock
                     in the morning, when we would generally meet before the trial, we'd each have a volume of the transcript, which is very useful
                     in conducting cross-examination and carrying on the case. That was a tremendous organizational effort. Done entirely— I believe,
                     if I remember correctly, I don't think anyone got paid anything for that. It was just people who work all day and come in
                     and type for two or three hours at night.

                     points—or low points, for that matter—that come to mind over the course of the trial that you'd like to share with us?

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, I suppose there were patterns that went to the trial— The relationship of what went on in a trial and what went into
                     the press was very interesting. The informers, without exception—and I mean without exception—were shown to be liars and persons
                     that just couldn't be trusted. Like, I remember one, who was not part of the stable, who was brought in. Was a young person,
                     who had gone into the party at the instance of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and who had been taken in by a Communist
                     Party family. He'd been sick and cared for by them, and been treated like a son. And all the time, he was reporting on them.
                     That kind of thing had appeared again and again during the trial. That one was the most striking example of the kind of double-dealing
                     that these people did.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But as far as the press was concerned, the interesting thing was this kind of thing would happen: Put on a witness in the
                     morning, and the witness would
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">400</span> ―
                     </div>give testimony that was, that sounded devastating. Just, you know, such and such a thing happened, and this was, and he said
                     this, and that the only way of accomplishing the overthrow is by force and violence. And then you'd take the witness in the
                     afternoon, and in a number of cases the witnesses admitted that they had lied. We got from the government their reports, which
                     they had furnished, as to what had happened at these meetings. There was no resemblance between the reports that they gave
                     to the government and the testimony that they gave. They finally would admit that they had exaggerated or lied and so forth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What would happen in the press was that their direct testimony, in all its awfulness from the standpoint of the public, was
                     printed. Not a word about the cross-examination. And this happened not just once, but time after time after time. It was a
                     rarity when there would be word in the press about anything that the defendants did that was favorable to them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">One of the interesting things was there [was] a group of about, oh, I think, twelve or fifteen newspaper reporters who sat
                     all through the trial. We got to be quite friendly with some of them. And they would tell us, "We wrote the story. We wrote
                     everything that happened. We don't decide what's published." They said, "The city desk did that." And they'd be apologetic
                     about what was happening.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It wasn't just an occasional thing. It was a day-in-and-day-out thing. And it's such a reflection, in my opinion, on our so-called
                     freedom of press and the right of people to know. It's difficult to equate the First Amendment and that as meaning the same
                     thing. And by the way, we were first-page news most of the time during that six-month period. Sometimes with headlines on
                     the first page, and if you had read just those headlines— And what they would do, the headlines would be worse than the stories.
                     You know, they'd take a story, and then
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">401</span> ―
                     </div>they'd make a headline that wasn't even in the story. Of course, they do that with lots of stories now in order to attract
                     attention, and not only this. Of course we had to suffer it for over a six-month period.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I suppose the most interesting part of the trial was the argument that was made. I was assigned the task of arguing theory,
                     and it was a thankless task. I must say I don't think it was one that the jury really accepted or even understood. I think
                     the most brilliant argument that was made was made by Leo Branton [Jr.], who spoke about the relationship of the Communist
                     Party to blacks, and who talked about the things that the Communist Party had done for the people, the black people. And he
                     would say, he would say such things as, "This is what they did. Who else was willing to do that? And that's why they're in
                     court here today." He made a brilliant argument.

                     we were not even in the position to raise that question, and we didn't. Of course, we had lengthy discussions about the instructions
                     that went on, I think, for almost a week. And then the jury went out. It was off for a week. I remember they gave us a room
                     to sit in and wait. We played pinochle, several of us, while we were waiting. I remember that.

                  <p class="noindent">On the fifth day of deliberations, just before noon, the jury came in with a verdict of guilty for everyone. It was obvious
                     that several of them, I think there were four or five women on the jury, several of them had been crying. It was obvious,
                     you know, you could see that. The fact that they stayed out for a week, we thought was rather remarkable in those times. It
                     came as no great surprise. As soon as the verdict was returned, guess what Judge [William C.] Mathes did? He remanded everyone
                     to jail. We announced we're going to take

                     would happen, did happen. And that the first— The cross-examination consisted almost entirely of asking her to give names.
                     Immediately she refused. She took the position that she would talk about herself and about her codefendants, all of whom had
                     admitted they were communists and published—and functioned publicly. She said she would talk about other public communists,
                     like the national board and things of that kind, but that she would not give them the names of others who might be injured
                     by having their names mentioned. And the judge immediately held her in contempt repeatedly and— I'm just trying to remember
                     how his sentence went. Hang on for a minute. Hold it for a minute.

                     the same question, and she refused to answer any of them. She was judged guilty of eleven criminal contempts. He sentenced
                     her, Mathes sentenced her to eleven one-year terms, which was six years longer than the maximum sentence he could give on
                     the Smith Act [Alien Registration Act, 1940] itself. And of course he remanded her immediately. How did we get bail on her?

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. Then it came back, and they reduced the sentence to the seven months that she had already been confined to jail in the
                     course of the several proceedings against her, which included the pretrial time that she spent and so forth. So that actually
                     she was held— I think we got bail from the [United States Court of Appeals for the] Ninth Circuit for her. I think he refused
                     her bail, and we got bail from the Ninth Circuit, pending the appeal. And then that took about a month or two months. So that
                     she was in jail twice. She was in jail once—I think that lasted about five months—along with all of the other defendants,
                     until we got bail granted. I think we discussed that. Then, immediately after the trial was over, she was in jail for close
                     to two months, and then she was granted bail by the Ninth Circuit, and then she never served any more time. Because, first
                     of all, it was remanded for a new sentence, and then he gave her one year on the new sentence. The court, by the way, as I
                     remember it now, when they sent her back for resentencing indicated that these one-year sentences [were] harsh. But Mathes
                     didn't pay any attention to that anymore than he paid attention before that. So that she was finally cleared in May of 1958
                     by the Supreme Court decision.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, while Oleta O'Connor Yates was in jail, some issues came up concerning ill-treatment of her while she was in jail. Do
                     you recall what that was about?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. I think it was related to visiting rights, if I remember correctly, and books, denial of books. I don't remember the
                     details, but I remember that there were those complaints. And there was a struggle that went on around them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">You see, the first five months that all of them spent in jail was really not such terrible time that they spent. Because,
                     as a practical matter, they were working on their case, and they were, as I— You know, they had one wonderful

                     conditions were bad. Oleta O'Connor Yates was really not, was not a strong person; she was not well. She died just a few years
                     after the case ended. And I'm sure the burden of the case and of her time in jail— You can't prove it, but I'm sure that it
                     had some contribution to her health and her dying.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I don't remember the details of the jail problem, but I know there was a campaign around that. I did not have very much to
                     do with that, because we were very busy working on the appeal. When the case was over, Sam [Samuel] Rosenwein and I went immediately
                     to work on the appeal to be filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit. Before that— You want to go into that

                     Rosenwein and myself. And argued in the court of appeals, however, by several counsel, including Leo Branton and Al [Abraham
                     Lincoln] Wirin. I don't know whether anyone else argued it or not, but we never had any hope of anything, except the worst
                     possible result, in the Ninth Circuit. And we got what we expected.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">All the way through, the Ninth Circuit was as bad as Mathes, except that on the bail thing the circuit was prepared to follow
                     the Supreme Court, whereas Mathes was not. And you remember, I've already discussed that. But otherwise they affirmed Mathes
                     on everything. They affirmed him on the original eleven contempts; they affirmed him on the one-year sentence for the one
                     contempt. And so it's not only Mathes who was overruled, but the Ninth Circuit in [counts] one, two, three, four unanimous
                     opinions of the circuit.

                     General Ramsey Clark. [Tom] Clark resigned from the Supreme Court so that his son could become attorney general. Of course
                     Ramsey Clark is now a really remarkable, leading liberal figure in so many areas today, whereas his father was the most reactionary
                     guy on the Supreme Court—and really vicious. So that's an interesting factor. Once the cases were decided in the court of
                     appeals, we prepared a petition for hearing in the Supreme Court. Again, it was Sam and me who did, as I recall it, all of
                     the work, or if not all, virtually all of the work on that. I don't remember exactly at what stage, but we— The counsel that
                     had tried the cases and been so blasted by the papers. For six months, we were in the papers every day, and we were baited
                     right along with our clients. We felt that it was very important to get one or two people to participate in the argument before

                     it's a distinction to argue a case before the Supreme Court. We didn't go to so many attorneys, because we wanted somebody
                     with a reputation, not just somebody who couldn't be smeared. And we were turned down by everyone on the ground that they
                     couldn't afford to do it. No matter what we paid them, they couldn't afford to do it. I think there was one attorney who said,
                     "If you pay me a hundred thousand dollars, I'll do it." And he knew, you know—

                  <p class="noindent">Let's see, which one was that? I'm not sure. I'm not sure which one that was. But in any event, we sought out, and we couldn't
                     get anybody. So finally we arranged—Barney [Benjamin] Dreyfus and I arranged—to meet with the board of governors of the state
                     bar. We presented the facts of what our problem was, of the fear that there was among the bar, and saying that this was a

                     cases of this kind. In the resolution, they said two things: One, attorneys have the duty of representing causes no matter

                  <p class="noindent">At the same time, there was an Oakland attorney—an older man, now dead—by the name of Donovan, [Augustin] Donovan, member
                     of the board of governors and an important California lawyer. He said, "I volunteer to handle it." He said, "I have two conditions.
                     One condition—" I say three. He said, "One condition is that I will not accept a fee. Second condition is I want to, the only
                     thing I want is for you to— I want to select a young law graduate or senior law student to work with me and you are to pay
                     him. And three, you have no control over my arguments."

                  <p class="noindent">We accepted him, and he came into the case. We decided that he should represent Al Richmond. Al Richmond was the editor of
                     the <i>Daily People's World.</i> The evidence against him consisted almost entirely of issues— Of the fact that he was editor, and of issues of the <i>Daily People's World,</i> which had nothing in it, of course, about [laughter] overthrowing the government by force and violence. And of course his
                     membership in the Communist Party, alongside that, and that he had attended some meetings, so forth. So, I sent him all of
                     the exhibits and portions of the transcript that related to Al Richmond. Oh, I sent it to the law student; he selected a Stanford
                     [University] law student. And the Stanford law student prepared a summary of the facts for him and sent him some of the exhibits
                     to read.

                  <p class="noindent">I remember, this is one thing I remember so vividly. A month or so later, he calls me on the phone. And he is in a dudgeon!
                     He says, "I cannot understand this. If there was ever a violation of the First Amendment! What does the First Amendment mean?
                     I've read everything they've got against him." He was absolutely outraged. He said, "I am going to tell the Supreme Court
                     what I think of this kind of prosecution." [laughter]

                  <p class="noindent">The interesting thing is that— Oh, first of all, the Supreme Court—you usually have an hour on each side to argue a case before
                     the Supreme Court. In this case, the court gave us two hours, which is done maybe once in several hundred cases. Maybe once
                     a year, twice a year that they do that. They gave us two hours. I carried the main burden; I argued an hour. Bob Kenny argued
                     for half an hour and Donovan argued for half an hour.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And Donovan made the most unlawyerlike argument that I've ever heard in my life. It was just an argument in which he said
                     very much the same thing that he said to me over the phone. That this was absolutely outrageous! That you didn't have to know
                     anything about the First Amendment to know how outrageous this was. And god, it was just a thing of beauty as far as I was
                     concerned. He really didn't argue any law as such, except these statements of broad principle. He said it— I don't mean that
                     he said it as badly as I'm saying it now. He had prepared his argument, but it was really just an expression of total outrage.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He read some examples. He'd say, "Now, <i>this</i> is what a man can be sent to jail for five years for!" [laughs heartily] "Doing this thing!" He said, "Here he wrote this.
                     I don't agree with this, but my god, you mean he doesn't have a right to say it?" Or he'd say, "Now, this I agree with. You
                     would send me to jail!" [laughter] It was that kind. I don't remember if these were the exact [words], but it had that quality
                     about it. As a matter of fact, it was probably one of the most unlawyerlike arguments that has ever been made before the Supreme
                     Court.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It was just— He was absolutely outraged. So that we did have a very, very good balance before the Supreme Court. Bob, who
                     was a good friend of Earl Warren, he was a broad lawyer. Donovan would never have been connected with anything Left of— I
                     don't think he had been as far Left as the Democratic

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The argument was a very interesting argument. Bob and Donovan argued first. And I argued—took the last hour and also the rebuttal.
                     There was no question from minute one that they were going to reverse. And they were going to reverse on the basis of what
                     Judge Mathes had done to it: on the saying the abstract doctrine was enough, that you didn't have to advocate action, and
                     on his definition of the word "organize" in which they [the defense] said that that was barred by the statute of limitations,
                     because "organize" obviously meant to organize in the sense of to form, to bring into being, and didn't mean just general
                     organizational work. The debate really went on.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was a debate that went on on the bench, largely between [William O.] Douglas, [Hugo L.] Black on the one side; and [Felix]
                     Frankfurter on the other. Frankfurter took the position— He asked me a question very early. He said, "Mr. Margolis, if we
                     are going to reverse on the grounds that the instructions were incorrect, why should we reach any other point?"
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I gave the argument that we were entitled not only to a new trial, but we were entitled to have no new trial at all. And that
                     even trying a case like this, the first time, and a second time, was itself a violation of the First Amendment, was itself
                     damaging. And Black and Douglas, mostly Douglas, were asking me questions. They were throwing questions to me to get me to
                     make my points on this side, and he was throwing questions to me to get me to make points on the other side. They were arguing
                     back and forth in this position. And [Robert H.] Jackson, by the way, was on my side on this, too. So, it's interesting the
                     way— The Supreme Court justices often carry on debates by the questions that they ask, indicating how they think. But in the
                     end, the result was that— Let me give you from the case what the Court decided.

                     other cases pending. Up until that point, the attorneys who had acted for the defendants had all been attorneys associated
                     with the Left—the trade union movement and generally with the Left. But there were so many of these cases going on, and the
                     attorneys just couldn't continue to do it. So that what happened was that in a number of cases, the court appointed counsel,
                     special counsel to represent them. And I traveled around the country to the cities where the cases were pending, and talked
                     to those special counsel.

                  <p class="noindent">Yeah, maybe you can. In any event, I went around and talked to these attorneys. For example, I keep saying Denver because
                     I had the most interesting experience in Denver, which was not altogether different, but to

                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">414</span> ―
                     </div>some extent different from experiences anywhere else. What the court had done there was to go to the biggest firms in town
                     and said to the biggest firms in town, four, five of them, or six, "I want each of you to designate one lawyer to act in this
                     case, because we need several lawyers, and I want them. We just can't pick anybody; they've got to have good representation."
                     And so the court— These firms had designated lawyers to work without compensation at the request of the court. They had set
                     up an office, and they were working full-time on preparing the defense in the Smith Act case in Denver.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I don't remember how many lawyers there were, but there were five or six of them. I went and met them. Found that they were
                     working very hard; they were taking the case very seriously. And they were outraged. They told me, when I sat down and talked
                     to them, that when they came into the case, they came into it very reluctantly. They felt that they would have to put on a
                     defense in something that they didn't believe in. And it was just very difficult for them to come in on the case. But now,
                     not only were they glad they were in it, by god, they were going to tell this court. And they were going to do a job. Well,
                     the case was never tried, because it was dismissed as a result of our victory. But similarly with other lawyers who had been
                     appointed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">That was the only place where there wasn't a single Left lawyer associated with the other lawyers. In the other cities, it
                     was more expected that this would happen, because there was at least one Left lawyer who was working with other lawyers that
                     weren't Left. And in each case, the lawyers were totally devoted to the defendants in the case. It was a very interesting
                     thing that happened. And it was significant, because lawyers are trained to believe in the First Amendment. The case that
                     the government had was so much nonsense that any good lawyer had to perceive it as such, unless he was as blind an anticommunist
                     as Mathes was. Otherwise, a good lawyer just couldn't live with the case.

                     As I read the decision, as a layperson, I read it as the Court not wanting to make a ringing defense of the First Amendment
                     where communists were concerned, but sort of arriving at that conclusion more, perhaps, on a technical ground than on very
                     strong constitutional grounds. Now, that is sort of the way I read it, and I was wondering if you would comment on that?

                  <p class="noindent">It's true, but let me, for example, read you a little language from the decision: [reading]
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p class="noindent">But when it comes to party advocacy or teaching in the sense of a call to forcible action at some future time, we cannot but
                           regard this record as strikingly deficient. At best, this voluminous record shows but a half-dozen or so scattered incidents
                           which, even under the loosest standards, could be deemed to show such advocacy. Most of these were not connected with any
                           of the petitioners, or occurred many years before the period covered by the indictment. We are unable to regard this sporadic
                           showing as sufficient to justify viewing the Communist Party as a nexus between these petitioners and the conspiracy charge.

                  <p class="noindent">Now, that may not seen like very much today, but when you compare it with what preceded this, and when you compare it with
                     the decision in the <i>Dennis</i> case [<i>Dennis</i> v. <i>United States</i>] it was really a very forward-looking and progressive statement. On the other hand, they didn't go as far as they should
                     have gone. They should have thrown out the case against everybody. It was a compromise obviously, which often happens in these
                     cases. And they wanted to go on to say the specific saying: You cannot say, you cannot hold that because a person is a member
                     of the Communist Party, he is guilty of violation

                     <blockquote>
                        <p class="noindent">In short, while the record contains evidence of little more than a general program of educational activity by the Communist
                           Party, which included advocacy of violence as a theoretical matter, we are not prepared to say at this stage of the case that
                           it would be impossible for a jury resolving all conflicts in favor of the government, and giving the evidence of those San

                     that it's been about five, six months since November. Since our last session, you've been involved in an important trial.

                     name of the case was <i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>Stabach.</i> The case was not uncommon in certain respects, but was quite unusual in other respects. Does set a precedent, and a practical

                     before, and that was that I played a secondary role in the handling of the case. A young woman attorney in our office, Barbara
                     Hadsell, was lead counsel. Though I worked with her and assisted her, she carried the principal burden of the case. We were

                  <p class="noindent">There had been many cases— Many may be an exaggeration, but it was not uncommon to have cases in which injunctive relief was
                     obtained against slumlords, requiring them to bring their buildings up to code, so that they would comply with the law. And

                     who suffered from the effects of the slum conditions. We filed a case on behalf of approximately ninety individuals, who together
                     made up fifteen families. Most of the families were quite large: six, seven. There was one family of eleven, I believe, living
                     in one room. All living, each of them living— Each family living in one fairly large room, with a kitchen and a bathroom,
                     under abysmal, absolutely abysmal conditions: rat infested, roach infested, terrible plumbing, water coming from the ceilings,
                     ceilings falling—every kind of deplorable condition.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">What we did was we brought the case to trial for damages. As a basis for damages, we had very little by way of physical injury.
                     We did have a few rat bites of children—it was always children who were bitten—but in none of the cases did the rat bites
                     result in more than pain and having to be taken to a doctor once. In each case, it cleared up in a week, two weeks, three
                     weeks. So, there were no serious physical injuries. The main basis for our case was

                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Because there were fifteen families and it was such a complex case, with so much evidence to be put in on each family, there
                     were vigorous attempts to settle the case. Before trial, we had an offer of $100,000 for all of the families. Although the
                     judges tried to make us take it, we refused to take it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We agreed upon trying the case on liability first—was this a bad building?—and for damages for two of the families. We selected
                     one family that we thought was our best family. The other side selected one family, which they thought was our weakest family.
                     We thought if we got a judgment on those two— First of all, if we lost the case, it would be over. If we won the case, the
                     damages that we got might help us to settle the case for the other thirteen families.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So, we did try the case for the two families, simply for emotional distress. For Hispanic families who did not speak English,
                     most of whom were here without papers, we got for the two families $92,000 from a jury. And it did lead to a settlement of
                     the case overall. The paper said $500,000; it was actually a $545,000 settlement for the case, including attorney's fees.

                  <p class="noindent">This is the first time that there has been a recovery of anyplace near that magnitude, and the first one of these cases that,
                     on the issue of damages, has been fought out the way we fought it out. The impact of this, we hope, will be twofold: One,
                     it will encourage attorneys to take more cases of this kind and to go after the slumlords. We intend to be involved in some
                     additional litigation, but there's only a certain amount of it that we're in a position—

                  <p class="noindent">The problem in this city and, I think, in most cities is that the health department, the building and safety department, the
                     plumbing department are all totally understaffed. For example, in the worst area in town, there are eight inspectors who have
                     to inspect about fifteen hundred buildings, almost a thousand of which are slum buildings. It's just impossible. In addition
                     to that, whatever the reasons may be, they do a lousy job. There is some indication, at least in some instances—we can't prove
                     it—that there are payoffs in this. And there is another thing: because they can't do a good job, they very often try to conceal
                     how bad a job they're doing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, during the trial of this case, we did not call to the stand any of these inspectors. The defense called
                     them. In direct examination, they were very favorable to the defendant's case. They said, "It was a fair building. He tried
                     hard; he was doing a decent job."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">By the time we finished with them on cross-examination, they had become our witnesses. Because we had the photographs, we
                     had the material, we had the reports showing the conditions, and so forth. They simply had to admit that they might say a
                     building was fair if it had thousands of rats in it and was just filled with roaches, and in every apartment, there was water
                     leaking from the ceiling, plaster falling, and mice and rats moving about.

                  <p class="noindent">So, one of the things that happened by the way— This litigation lasted for five years, and during the course of the five years,
                     there were very considerable improvements in the building. [telephone rings, tape recorder off]

                     Cockroach problem is the most difficult. The plumbing has been very much improved, as well as the plaster, so that the condition
                     is very improved. In addition, as a result of our judgment, they're going to make some additional repairs, because the settlement
                     included an agreement that they were to make certain additional repairs. So that by the time we get through, the building
                     will be in, you know, for an old building, in fairly decent shape, at least livable.

                  <p class="noindent">Anyway, the important, as I say, the important thing about this case is it sets a practical precedent, which, I think, particularly
                     if a number of other lawyers start lawsuits and if we push some additional ones, may begin to bring about a change. Which
                     the official government, which has the task of seeing to it that the housing complies to code, will never do.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, before we go forward in time—from 1952, in the Smith Act cases where we left off last time— I'd like to go back a little
                     bit and just, fairly briefly, ask you to talk about some cases. Different cases involving different matters, but all centering
                     on fishing and fishermen, starting with a case back in 1949, <i>Local 36 of International Fishermen</i> [<i>and Allied Workers of America</i>] v. <i>United States,</i> which was 177 F. 2d 320. And also another case, which was in the sixties, <i>Biazevich</i> v. <i>National Labor Relations Board,</i> 374 F. 2d 974. If you could briefly tell us about those cases involving the small fishermen.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Yes, there were two fishermen locals here that we represented, Local 33 and Local 36. Local 33 was composed of the commercial
                     fishermen, who fished at that time for sardines, during the sardine season—we were a major, we were the major sardine port,
                     sardine area in the world—and for tuna
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">422</span> ―
                     </div>during the rest of the year. Local 36 were market fishermen. The market fishermen had small boats, one- or two-, maybe sometimes
                     three-person operations, wholly owned by the working fishermen. They were really workers. And they would bring in their fish
                     and sell it to the wholesalers, who in turn would sell it to restaurants, to markets, etcetera.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The individual fisherman had absolutely no bargaining power, because when they came in with their fish, their small boats
                     had no adequate icing facilities. They couldn't keep the fish long, so they had to sell it for what they could get or throw
                     it overboard. And they sold it for what they could get. So they combined to bargain collectively for a price for the fish.
                     Believe it or not, there were, I think, oh, maybe 150 of them, somewhere in that number, a relatively small number of people.
                     All of them poor people, really workers. And the government charged them with violating the antitrust laws for price fixing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Our argument, our contention was that, in effect, this was in their instance like wages, or we could say agricultural cooperatives.
                     We had organized something like a cooperative—agricultural cooperatives are allowed to combine and fix prices, or negotiate
                     for prices collectively—and for the very same reason. An agricultural commodity is one that you harvest; you have to sell
                     it or else.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So we tried the case, and we lost it. I tried it— I was then the attorney for Local 36 and Local 33; the firm was, but I did
                     most of their work. We brought in Robert [W.] Kenny, who had just left the post of attorney general at that time, and he tried
                     the case with me, but we lost it, in any event. Ever since then, the local fishermen have been unorganized and have had a
                     very, very tough, tough time making a living.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The other case involved the commercial fishing boats, which were then small, as compared to the boats today. A large boat
                     was 300-, 350-ton carrying capacity. Today, it's 1,500, 2,000 tons, but in those days, those were the big
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">423</span> ―
                     </div>boats. They had combined for collective bargaining. What they had done, what they had been able to do was to bargain collectively
                     and reach a standard form of agreement. But the standard form of agreement had to be signed separately by each boat. And so
                     it was possible to divide the boats and to have some of them vary from the standard agreement, and thereby weaken the union.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The Biazevich case was a case which took six months to try before the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board], in which we asked
                     for a collective bargaining unit, consisting of all of these large boats that fish part of the year for tuna and part of the
                     year for sardines. So that the bargain that was reached would be a bargain that would be binding upon all of the members of
                     the union.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Actually, we had a price-fixing problem there too, and this was one of the elements in the case. Fishermen fish on the basis
                     of a share of the catch. A share of the catch means your agreement will provide that the boat will get— First of all, you
                     deduct certain expenses from the amount received from the sale of the fish. Then the boat will, say, get 50 percent and the
                     remaining 50 percent is the crew's share. And that's divided among the crew in certain proportions: one share, two shares,
                     a share and a half, so that the— Actually, the price is one of the determining factors in the amount that is received. One
                     of the things that the canneries were claiming is that we were— They are controlling the price. Well, we worked out a device,
                     where we said, "We don't give a darn what you sell the price for—what you sell the fish for—but we want to be paid on a certain
                     price in computing this. You can collect more or less. We want to get paid on a certain price." And that stood up. We got
                     a unit composed of the large fishing boats certified by the court. Since then, of course, there have been numerous changes.
                     First of all, the fleet moved largely to San Diego. Now there's virtually no fishing fleet that fishes out of U.S. ports;
                     they now fish out of Guam, Puerto Rico, and so forth. So at the present time, what we accomplished
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">424</span> ―
                     </div>then has little value, but it did have a great deal of value for many years at that time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We had another case [<i>Local 33</i> v. <i>American Tuna Committee</i>] about that time which arose in connection—a little later—rose in connection with one of those contracts. What happened was
                     when the contract was negotiated, toward the end of the season there was an oversupply, a big supply of fish that year, and
                     the boat owners had always negotiated with the canners for the price, which was fixed in the union contract. And it really
                     worked in a way where the fishermen were involved, but indirectly. What happened in this case— There was a contract, a boat
                     contract, which fixed the price: a union contract which said that percentage of the catch should be based upon such and such
                     a price. Toward the end of the season the— See, there were no contracts between—no binding contracts, as I recall—between
                     the boats and the canners. There were between the boats and the union. So, toward the end of the season, the canners said
                     to the boats, "We're cutting the price if you want to fish. You don't have to fish, but if you want to fish, we cut it a hundred
                     dollars a ton." Or two hundred dollars a ton. I don't remember the details.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The fishermen's union said, "Go fishing—we want to, but you're going to pay us if we go fishing on the basis of this price."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So, some of the boats tied up, went to the members, and said, "Unless you fish at this lower price, we're just not going to
                     go."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So a number of the members— Oh, these boats withdrew from the contract and formed the committee called the American Tuna Committee.
                     They went out fishing at lower prices, breaching their contract with the union and also violating the National Labor Relations
                     Act by firing their old crews and hiring new crews, who would fish for the smaller amount. We had to— It's another case where
                     the hearing was almost six months. So, the fishing industry is [a]
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">425</span> ―
                     </div>very complex industry. We finally, in that, prevailed and got an order, which reinstated the crew, got them back wages, and
                     so forth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">In the long run, that one didn't do very much good, because what happened was that the individual fishermen began— The price
                     of tuna went up: high, higher and higher and higher. An individual fisherman began making $25,000, $35,000, $40,000 a year
                     at a time when an average workingman, if he made $15,000 a year, had a very good job. Or $12,000 a year was not bad at all.
                     And the boats were able— The jobs were so much in demand that the boats were able to chisel one way or another. The unions

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, that activity in restrictive covenant cases was largely through the Los Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild,
                     although our office also had a number of these cases. The principal one was handled primarily by John [T.] McTernan. Let's
                     think if I can think of the name of the case. May come to me. That was a case in which John won in the California Supreme
                     Court, where—<i>In re Laws</i>—where there was an attempt to evict a black family from a home that they owned, because there was a restrictive covenant
                     on that. But I worked primarily with a black lawyer by the name of Loren Miller, a very prominent black lawyer, who later

                  <p class="noindent">Loren Miller, Sr., yeah. He wasn't called Senior, but it was Loren Miller. And there is a Loren Miller, Jr., who's now a judge.
                     Loren Miller, Sr., is dead, been dead for a number of years. We worked with him on the briefs and on the theory. I think I
                     might tell you one rather interesting thing that happened in the course of this trial. At one point I thought I had a brilliant
                     idea. I had been reading on the question what is— The term used at that time was "Negro." By the way, "black" at that time
                     was considered a degrading term. You were a racist if you used the term "black". Now it's almost the other way around. So,
                     "Negro" was the term used, and the restrictive covenant spoke of Negroes. I started raising the question: What is a Negro?
                     Who is a Negro? It said nothing about what percentage of blood. How do you determine a person is a Negro? I ran across a study
                     by an anthropologist, who said that as far as Negroes are concerned, there are almost no Negroes who've lived in the United
                     States for several generations who don't have white blood in them—almost none, if any—and that there is no way of telling
                     whether they did or didn't have, or how much. That a person could have 1 percent Negro blood and produce a child that was
                     black, and you could have 99 percent and produce a child that was white. There's just no way of knowing. So I went— I remember
                     going to a meeting of lawyers, black and white lawyers, and saying— You know, at that time the restrictive covenants were
                     being upheld. We were attacking them on the fundamental grounds of denial of due process, which was of course the basic form
                     of attack.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I said, "Why don't we attack this on the ground that it's unenforceable, because you can't tell what a Negro is?" And I was
                     met with a storm from the black people there, because I had not been sensitive.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They said, "What you're expecting us to do is to get up and disavow the fact that we're Negroes. And we're not going to do
                     that. We're fighting for our

                  <p class="noindent">So I recognized quickly [laughs] that my clever legal tactic was not one they were buying. They were, of course, right. That
                     the fight on that kind of an issue was the wrong way to fight. But it shows how lawyers sometimes get engrossed in trying
                     to win a case and forget the basic principle of what is involved.

                     30, 1952. You appeared before HUAC [House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities], and in the sort of scope— That's

                     Apparently, somewhat fewer people actually ended up testifying before HUAC while they were here in Los Angeles. And what I
                     wanted to ask you about— Your testimony before HUAC, or portions of it, are recorded and certainly in the transcript, and
                     there was a lot of coverage of what was going on. But I'm interested in asking you specifically about two things that might
                     not be as well documented in the public record. One would be the strategy discussions and preparations that were made for
                     HUAC's visit to Los Angeles—that would be sort of part A of my question. Part B, because a lot of attorneys and other professionals
                     were called during that particular period, it apparently led to a debate within both the state and local bars over what should
                     be the attitude of attorneys toward HUAC and other congressional committees. And you were even— Came in for some chastisement
                     for your militant testimony before HUAC. So, it's kind of a two-part question, but I'd like to deal with both of those things.

                     </div>Sometime in the fifties, there was legislation being passed in various states, anticommunist legislation, to the effect that
                     people who were communists couldn't be lawyers or doctors or— You had to take an anticommunist oath and so forth. Such legislation
                     was introduced in the assembly and senate of the state of California. The [National] Lawyers Guild formed an independent committee
                     against loyalty oaths. It did statewide mailing and statewide— Carried on a really big campaign against this legislation.
                     The guild, for many, many years before that and at that time, was active in what's called the [California] State Bar Conference
                     [of Barristers], which is an annual meeting of various bar associations of the state bar which passed resolutions and which
                     is influential in determining state bar positions. There was introduced at one of these sessions of the conference, at several
                     of them, but the first one, a resolution, several resolutions— One resolution would support the legislation— I don't remember.
                     There were a number of different bills, and I don't remember exactly what the form of the particular bill was. Also, resolutions
                     that all persons who were members of the Communist Party should be disbarred, or who refused to take an anticommunist oath
                     should be disbarred. And this was in the height of the McCarthy period. We fought against this at the conference, and from
                     the very first, defeated it. Our first year we defeated it; it was quite close, maybe five to four, or something like that.
                     There were about 500 delegates, and I think we beat it, maybe 275 to 225, somewhere in that area. But year after year, the
                     resolutions, or similar resolutions, were introduced, until it finally became a laughingstock. Each year, it was more decisively
                     defeated, and it got to a point where no one would even argue the thing. The resolution would come up, but— And there was
                     one crackpot who'd get up and argue in favor of it. Nobody would attempt to answer him, and it was routinely defeated. So
                     we had laid a basis within the legal profession to fight against these loyalty oaths and so forth.

                     I'm sure that the U.S. attorney advised them not to do anything like that. It would have been foolish. But, they didn't wait
                     as I walked out. [laughter] There were, I think, altogether, twenty-five lawyers served. And the lawyers testified over a
                     period of three days, I think something like that, three or four days. I was the first of the lawyers, first person called
                     at the hearing. My testimony consisted primarily of an attack upon the committee—a refusal to answer questions. As to the
                     question of the constitutional— What position we took, that has a history, too. We had, by that time, of course, lost the
                     [John Howard] Lawson [<i>Lawson</i> v. <i>United States</i>] and [Dalton] Trumbo [<i>Trumbo</i> v. <i>United States</i>] cases of the [Hollywood] Ten, so that the First Amendment—at least as far as the courts at that point were concerned—could
                     not be relied on to keep you out of jail. But the Fifth Amendment we had participated in establishing as being something that
                     could be claimed. Generally speaking, most people did rely on the Fifth, along with everything else. We relied on the entire
                     Constitution: First, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth—all of them. But included the Fifth in our claim; and this, of course, protected
                     us from going to jail.

                  <p class="noindent">There were a few people at the time— There was quite an argument that went around. There were a few people who said that it
                     was unprincipled to claim the Fifth. You shouldn't claim the privilege of self-incrimination; that that would be construed
                     as admitting that being a member of the Communist Party

                     Because the Fifth Amendment, while it will protect the guilty, was not intended for the protection of the guilty; it was for
                     the protection of the innocent. And not to allow the government to ensnare you, as had been allowed previously, and that had
                     a long history behind it.

                  <p class="noindent">It's the great, great majority— I would say 98, 99 percent of the people who were called before the committee, after that,
                     relied on the Fifth Amend— On the Fifth Amendment, including the First. There were a few who relied on the First alone. It
                     think it was including Frank Wilkinson. [They] went to jail. And I respected them. They took a position which they believed
                     was principled. My own position was that it was playing into the hands of the enemy. Why do that for them? Anyway, the lawyers
                     put up, I think, a terrific fight. Every lawyer, even the ones we had thought would be weak, just stood up and were very strong.
                     And they were followed by other professionals, by doctors, and by trade union people. After I had testified myself, I represented
                     many of the people in the subsequent states of that same hearing. I had, as I say, attacked the committee, saying, among other
                     things— They threatened me with contempt, and I said I had nothing but contempt for the committee. It was not exactly— It
                     was kind of a brawl on an intellectual level, but with the constitutional points raised.

                     Press]. It was a letter in which I said, in effect, that while I was a lawyer, I appeared before them as a citizen; as a citizen,
                     I had a right to tell the committee what I thought of it, just like anybody else did, and this is what I thought of the committee.
                     I said it in many, many more words than that. [laughs] And the board of governors voted unanimously not to attempt to penalize

                     a military plane had collided with a passenger plane, a United Airlines passenger plane. Everybody on both planes was killed,
                     and I had one of the passengers and filed the first action. It got in the papers, but not our firm name. The <i>[Los Angeles] Times</i> had a policy [of] never using our firm name, except on political things. Otherwise, if we did newsworthy things, stories
                     would be told, but not our firm name, or using our name. So, the next day after we filed ours, again, there was a story. Frank
                     Belcher, this man who wrote this letter, had one case, and he filed it. Of course, given big publicity, his name all over
                     the paper [laughs] as having filed this. Nine additional clients walked into his office, meant almost a million dollars in
                     fees to him, because they had published his name. Altogether, there were forty-two— Forty-four people were killed, and there
                     were about nineteen lawyers. You can't try a case with nineteen lawyers. It's impossible. The court got all the lawyers together
                     and said that the lawyers— The lawyers agreed that they would select three lawyers to try the case on behalf of everybody
                     so far as liability was concerned. Then the individual lawyers would try their own cases on damages, and it was up to the
                     lawyers to select whoever they wanted to.

                     for Frank Belcher to say something. He didn't say a word. Nothing. I was approved unanimously. Then they voted— Then two or

                     We became very, very good friends. As a matter of fact, we won on both; we beat both the government and United Airlines. They
                     took it up on appeal. He and I argued it in the [federal] court of appeals and won in the court of appeals. As a matter of
                     fact, although we didn't see much of each other after that, he— A couple of weeks after the trial was over, he called me up,
                     and he says, "Ben, I miss you. Come down and have lunch with me." [laughter]

                     before the Rosenbergs [Ethel G. and Julius] were executed for alleged espionage, that there was a great deal of activity here
                     in Los Angeles around that case. I also understand that you were involved in that and also were part of the delegation that
                     went to Washington—even at one point, from the record, made an unsuccessful attempt to see President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower
                     while all this was going on. I wonder if you could touch on both the activities here in Los Angeles, as you recall them around
                     that case, and also your own personal involvement—the delegation, the things that you experienced around the Rosenberg case.

                  <p class="noindent">All right. I knew [Emanuel] Manny Bloch, the attorney for the Rosenbergs. Didn't have anything really to do with the case
                     during the trial itself, but spoke to him about the case a number of times on the appellate level, both in person when I was
                     East and, I think, several times over the phone. Just discussing some of the problems and ideas on the case. And we worked
                     on an <i>amicus</i> [<i>curiae</i>] brief in the case—I and several people. The leading lawyer here, however, who participated in that and made the biggest
                     contribution, was Dan [Daniel G.] Marshall! You may remember that I mentioned Dan Marshall as the one who—the Catholic lawyer
                     who came forward under great stress in the Smith Act case. One of the really most principled men I've ever known. Well, he
                     developed a theory that Bloch had not followed, which was ingenious and interesting. The kind of a theory that, if you had
                     a friend in court, might have been bought by the court, and he at the last moment filed a— He worked

                     he prepared a writ. I talked with him and did a little bit of the work, but my contribution to it was very minor. He was the
                     one who did 95 percent of the work, if not more. And he was the one who developed the idea. When the time came for— This was
                     presented just before the execution date, four or five days. There was a hearing scheduled in the Supreme Court, a last-minute
                     hearing, which included this new theory and various other things. A group of people, it wasn't really a form— You said it

                     was nothing of that kind going on at that time. So we went and primarily attended the Court. While there, a committee was
                     organized—I volunteered to work with it—to try to see Eisenhower to get a last-minute clemency. This guy, [Felix] Frankfurter,
                     during the course— No, there were two or three arguments before the Supreme Court. They heard argument, adjourned, heard argument
                     again, and finally rendered their decision refusing to stop the execution. Frankfurter said, "Never." He is, for me, one of
                     the most despicable men that ever lived, who <i>really</i> knew how wrong it was and who said so in his opinion: that said the place to go was to go to the president for clemency,

                  <p class="noindent">They were executed just before sunset. The reason was that the next day was a Jewish holiday, I believe. The Jewish holiday
                     starts at sunset, and they didn't want to execute them on a Jewish holiday. As a matter of fact, I was on a train. I had to
                     go to New York for certain other matters, and I was on a train going from Washington to New York at the time that they were
                     executed. It was a very sad occasion.

                  <p class="noindent">Why don't I tell you one, perhaps interesting, little tidbit. We were hanging around the Court at the last minute, hoping,
                     you know, for something further to happen, which didn't happen. And there was a big reception room, where most of us were,
                     away from the Court. I was talking to [I. F.] "Izzy" Stone, who was then publishing his newsletter, and was expressing my
                     anger at and disgust with Eisenhower. And Izzy agreed. He said, "But, you know, we're going to end up thanking god that Eisenhower
                     is the president. He's going to keep us out of war." And he turned out to be right. When [Richard M.] Nixon tried to involve
                     us thereafter in—what is the name of the place in Vietnam?

                  <p class="noindent">Dien Bien Phu. You know, Nixon was the vice president then. Wanted to send American planes, and Eisenhower refused. As a matter
                     of fact, Izzy said, "You know, really deep down, Eisenhower doesn't want war. He's against the military establishment, and
                     as long as he's president, we're going to stay out of war." Of course, you remember that Eisenhower, when he retired, gave
                     a really fine speech on the industrial-military complex, which is one of the straight, straight speeches, which ought to be
                     read again and again to the Congress when they're voting on the budget.

                     and was rationalized at that time. Manny Bloch was not the lawyer to represent the Rosenbergs. He was not a criminal lawyer;
                     he had no experience. He was a civil lawyer, an entirely different field. He was not particularly a trial lawyer. He went
                     in only because there was nobody else who would take the case. They had tried to get some Left lawyers. Not me, but they had
                     tried to get others, and they'd all refused. The reason for the refusal, that was given at least on confidential levels, was
                     that they thought that it was a mistake for the Rosenbergs to be represented by a Left lawyer, that that would tend to make
                     their position more difficult. And, of course, they ended up being represented by an unqualified Left lawyer, who did it.
                     Of course, he wasn't so prominently known as a Left lawyer as the ones that had been asked to do this. But as I look back
                     at it, I think it was a cop-out. They should never have been convicted, and I think— Well, no one knows.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Things were so tough and so difficult that I don't have— But for example, Manny stipulated that the document which was supposed
                     to be the secret that he [Julius Rosenberg] had stolen need not be put into evidence, because it would reveal a military secret.
                     The document was, of course, seen afterwards, and it had no secret. It was nothing. A good criminal lawyer would have said,
                     "No. Either you show the document, or you dismiss the case. We want our scientists to examine it to see whether a secret was
                     known." Well, he was isolated. He was alone. He thought if he sort of played along and played the patriotic part that it would
                     work. But it was a— I don't blame him, because I think he did— He was a courageous, dedicated man, who wrecked his life over
                     the case.

                     out all over the place. But there was another— There was a political thought, too. These lawyers were known as communist lawyers,
                     and from the standpoint of the Communist Party, they wanted to separate themselves from anything having anything to do with
                     claimed espionage. Again, I think a cop-out.

                     once again—a raging debate over what is usually posed as the question of whether they were, quote unquote, "guilty" or not

                     this: If I'd been on a jury, I'd have voted innocent. Entirely aside from any political beliefs, I would have voted innocent,
                     because there simply wasn't enough definite evidence to convict them in my opinion.

                  <p class="noindent">The only discussion I remember was on the issue of whether or not—whether there should be a campaign; that the Communist Party
                     should lead a campaign for them; whether or not Left lawyers should get involved in their thing. And the consensus was— And
                     I must admit I was part of it, although I never was directly asked to do anything that I refused to do. Consensus was that
                     it would be bad for the party, bad for the lawyers, and bad for them—that they ought to have someone else representing them.
                     As I look back on it, I think it was dead wrong, absolutely wrong, and should not have been the course followed.

                  <p class="noindent">One last question on the Rosenbergs' situation. According to one of your FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] reports, there's
                     a mention of a Sophie Davidson as being in charge of the L.A. committee in defense of the

                     </div>Rosenbergs. I'm not saying the exact name of it properly, but generically, the committee that was doing defense work for the
                     Rosenbergs. Do you remember her?

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, by the way, what I've been talking about up to this point is during the trial, up to their conviction and the imposition
                     of the death penalty [April 5, 1951]. After that, the Left did become active, very active, in the Rosenberg case—and the party,
                     the Communist Party did also—around the issue, primarily, of the death penalty. Of course, that was a worldwide movement.
                     So, I was active in the defense committee, but that defense committee was after the convictions. I don't think it even existed—
                     Well, I'm not sure. [National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case] At least, my activity was after their conviction,
                     and I believe, although I'm not positive, that it was formed after their conviction.

                     a campaign that was as successful, from the standpoint of arousing just reaction all over. The pleas were from everyone. Including
                     the pope. "Don't, don't kill them." We didn't think they'd

                     such a raw deal. See, the issue that is fought out in the books, in my opinion, is the wrong issue. The question of their
                     guilt or innocence is— Who really knows for sure on that? But it is possible to, in my opinion, for any rational person—no
                     matter what, lawyer, let's say, or person—whatever his political views are, to say that there was not enough evidence to convict
                     them. On that issue, I think they shouldn't have been. That was the issue. In other words, they were— For everyone else, you're
                     not convicted unless you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt, to a moral certainty. There was no such evidence in their case.

                     know, I'm a little confused about something between this and the [Harry] Bridges case [<i>Bridges v. California</i>], because I was involved in cross-examining an expert.

                     not certain enough to testify that it's not his signature." Or we did get an expert—that's where I'm confused —and he testified
                     very weakly. And the defense said, "Yes, he didn't think, but it might be." That kind of thing. Now, I'm just trying to remember
                     whether that happened in court or outside of court. It was one or the other.

                     leave it to you to verify or not. But I was quite interested in one entry, a report, April 12, 1954. It indicated that you
                     were involved in some way or other in the campaign against attempts by the immigration service to deport David Hyun. Am I

                     for driving them into Los Angeles. The rule was violated all over the place. George Shibley was representing one of the men
                     on a court-martial case, which would have been a very insignificant case that wouldn't have gotten much notice, except for

                     </div>defense that George Shibley put on, which was that the commanding general of the base was doing that himself. That, was, of
                     course, an attack, <i>lèse-majesté,</i> and that then became an all-out case on the part of the general to get this man convicted.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">During the hearing, one of the hearings—there were a number of them—George Shibley was entitled to receive, in due course,
                     a copy of the transcript. But there was some reason why he shouldn't receive it until some later date. But according to his
                     testimony, he received a copy of it in the mail from an unknown source, and then used it. The government claimed that he had
                     taken it off the desk of the prosecuting attorney. I may not have all the details exactly right, but that was the essence
                     of the thing. A really silly kind of a prosecution, and one that wouldn't have happened but for the nature of the times and
                     for the kind of defense he put up. It would have been a very minor thing. He was prosecuted. Represented by one of the best
                     trial attorneys in Los Angeles, [Joseph] Ball, who'd been president of the state bar [1956-57]. And he tried him [Shibley]
                     before a judge, a very reactionary district court federal judge [William Harrison]. [Ball], who was a fine lawyer and eminently
                     successful, had not been in the habit of trying political cases, which have these political overtones. George, of course,
                     was a "Lefty," and they were after him for that reason, too. And so when they tried the case, he [Ball] was so confident that
                     he would get an acquittal before the jury that he didn't protect his record; that is, he didn't make objections when there
                     were all kinds of error committed by the trial court. Joe Ball did not make the objections.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I worked on the appeal. He [Shibley] was convicted. Given three years, I think, and served almost two, the maximum, you know;
                     got time off for good behavior, but otherwise, the maximum time. I worked on the appeal brief for George and was also active
                     on his defense committee, raising money and so
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">452</span> ―
                     </div>forth. This was a felony that he was convicted of. We lost the appeal despite the fact that there was just— Replete with errors.
                     The objections hadn't been made. At least it's my opinion of what happened. I think most of the attorneys who are familiar
                     with the case would tend to agree.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then, to show how petty the thing is— Ordinarily, when an attorney is convicted of a felony, there is a disbarment. Well,
                     the state bar had to take some action, so they suspended George for part of the period of time he was in jail, and couldn't
                     have practiced anyway. That's what the state bar thought of this case. So that, as far as any effect on him as a lawyer, which
                     ordinarily that kind of a conviction would be the end of you as a lawyer, for him, it didn't affect him, except that he lost
                     a couple of years of his life and his practice.

                     the evidence was something like this, that the prosecutor said, "It was in court, we had a recess, and I had it on the desk.
                     It was lying there on the desk and I went out of the court and George stayed in. And he was the only one who was in there
                     at the time, and we went to the end of the day without a further recess. And then when I started putting my stuff together,
                     the transcript wasn't there. And then George shows up with a transcript within a day or two."

                     [United States] State Department and FBI materials, apparently you had an ill-fated attempt to get a passport in the early
                     fifties, around 1952, and then later were able to get one in 1959. Do I read those documents correctly?

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, yes. I don't remember— I was going to make, I think, a trip for business in '52, and I didn't get the passport. I don't
                     think I appealed it at that time, because by that time, the time that I wanted to go had passed. And then in '59, as I recall,
                     I had no trouble getting a passport.

                  <p class="noindent">Well, as I recall it, I was, as were many other people, very disturbed by the [Nikita] Khrushchev disclosures concerning [Joseph]
                     Stalin. You see, there had been many stories about Stalin going around before, but we didn't believe them. And one of the
                     reasons we didn't believe them: there were so many lies, that we knew were lies, being told about the Soviet Union, so we
                     didn't believe even the true things that were being said. And when this disclosure was made, it affected us in many ways.
                     One, what we believed in. But also in the peculiar way, with the way you have said, "This couldn't have happened," and said
                     it to lots of people. And "The press is lying." All of a sudden, these things, which we just didn't believe, turn out to be
                     true. And some of them even worse than what we said we didn't believe. It also indicated the bureaucratic nature of the Communist
                     Party and the arbitrariness. We were very disturbed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">At that time, discussion started among many of us about the question of the Communist Party position, which was pretty much
                     that the great theorists (and these people were always right) were the people in the Soviet Union. And because they were always
                     right, because they knew so much more than anybody else did, they laid down what was the correct line. It was simply a question
                     of following them. But, you know, if you, like— You go to somebody who knows a lot more than you do, and they tell you what
                     they think, you're inclined

                     </div>to follow what they did. And that was sort of the position of the Communist Party, which I, among many, many others, accepted.
                     And following that, we began to talk: "You know, you can't, you just can't do that anymore. It just, it just ain't so. And
                     we have to make more independent determinations." But the general line of the party, with the exception of some people like
                     Dorothy Healey out here, continued to be, you know, adhering to the comm— Pretty closely to the Russian line.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And I, over a period of time— My memory's very vague as to how it happened and how long it took, but I gradually dropped out.
                     I think there may have come a time when I said I'm no longer going to be a member. But at the same time I was very supportive
                     of all, I think virtually all, perhaps all, of the domestic things that the party was doing; I was completely in agreement
                     with them independently of anything else. The party was effective in those areas and doing a good job. So I continued to be
                     active, if not directly as a party member, in communist— In activities which I knew were Communist Party activities. So the
                     break is a very vague one for me, but after two, three years, something like that, I simply did not— I no longer attended
                     Communist Party meetings and didn't pay dues. Now, just when my break [was] made, I don't remember. And I continued in that
                     fashion until the latter part of 1968. For a number of years, there had been an annual banquet for the <i>People's World.</i> I, year after year, was the chairperson of that banquet, maybe five or six years running. In 1968, I was the chairperson.
                     That year I had been to Czechoslovakia, to Prague. As a matter of fact, I was there two weeks before the [Soviet] Red Army
                     moved in [on the night of August 20-21, 1968].

                  <p class="noindent">Well, while we were in Prague, a great many people spoke English. We, my wife and I, have a habit, when [we] go places, to
                     ride on streetcars and buses, and try to talk to people. People were just anxious to talk. And we went to— Everywhere we went,
                     people were talking. And there were meetings going on, street meetings. People who had just been released from prison were
                     speaking. There was an air of freedom about it, and people were just saying whatever they wanted to say about what was going
                     on. They were— One of their main things—they wanted to be left alone by the Soviet Union. And I was in agreement that they
                     should be. But there was a feeling of— You could talk to people; they would answer your questions. If they were critical of
                     something the government had done, they would say so. There appeared to be no fear.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We had just been to Budapest for a week before that. We had tried the same thing, and we found an entirely different atmosphere.
                     People wouldn't answer your questions. The guides that took us, you'd ask them any political thing—how's this going? what
                     they thought about that?—and they'd simply avoid it. They wouldn't answer you, and it was obvious that they weren't answering
                     either because of some policy or fear. In any event, there wasn't the same sense of freedom.

                  <p class="noindent">In addition to that, in Czechoslovakia, you know, it was a relatively prosperous place. People seemed to be living reasonably
                     well. It just looked like a free country of socialism, whereas the other places we'd been did not give us anything of that
                     attitude. So, I came back completely in love with what had happened there. And we met— Dorothy Healey had a friend, who was
                     a professor of philosophy [sociology], I think, but who was an advisor to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
                     Czechoslavakia.

                     made one promise to the Russians: that their press would stop criticizing the Russian government. And he got on the—people
                     interpreted for us—he got on the radio. He pleaded with the people to say, "Now, this is the only thing we're being asked

                     It had been prearranged, and he came— People were dancing in the street. There was such joy, and everywhere you went people
                     were celebrating. And he came, very, very sad face.

                     and pleading for this." And he said, "And these hotheads, who are right in what they're saying, but who are crazy from the

                     there were some differences in the way that Dorothy Healey dealt with things here on the West Coast, or in Southern California,
                     from the way that the party nationally did. What did you mean by that exactly?

                  <p class="noindent">Oh, she criticized the Soviet Union. She differed from party policy, and she was not afraid to speak out against what was
                     deemed to be party policy. She also talked about more openness and more democracy within the party. And, of course, here in
                     Southern California, she built the largest single group here, in Southern California, that had the most freedom of any group.
                     But, of course, when she left, they turned against her much more viciously than they did against me. Then it was— When she
                     left, you could be expelled from the Communist Party if you socialized with her.

                     go to San Francisco afterwards, and helped him get out of jail and in certain other respects. I think [I] may have even spoken
                     to a group that was involved in the demonstrations, but I was not involved and Val wasn't involved in the demonstration. That's
                     absolutely inaccurate, although they— I think I appeared in court for my son, and there may have been a newspaper article
                     with respect to that. From that, they may have drawn the conclusion that I was involved in the demonstration itself; may even
                     refer to the fact that I spoke somewhere <i>after</i> the demonstration, not at the demonstration. I was not living in San Francisco at the time.

                     active there. But Reed College, you know, is in Oregon, Portland, and there weren't any activities like that, as far as I
                     know, in Portland at that time. If there had been, I'm sure he would have been involved. But Roger, and later Greg, went to
                     San Francisco State College [now University]. Ken, also, later went to State for postgraduate work in dramatics. But my sons
                     have not been particularly active, politically, although they— Except here and there in demonstrations, they have not been
                     active in a consistent, organizational way, although their sympathies and agreement, feelings about things, are very much
                     the same as mine. My oldest son, Ken, works for an outfit known as Nature Conservancy. For about fourteen years, he was in

                     in Portland. My son Ken went up there first and was running a ranch up there. Got a chance to buy it on a very reasonable
                     basis, and did so. Later brought my son Greg up there, and they both— They each have a house on this ranch, although Ken is
                     now in Washington. And Greg is working— Greg didn't go to law school—he's working as a paralegal for a law firm there. And
                     he now is the only one taking care of the ranch. They have fifty-seven acres up there and some cattle. It's not really a commercial,
                     paying operation. They have their own meat, their own eggs, their own vegetables, fruit, things of that kind—berries. My son
                     Roger has been trying for years, not very successfully, to become a screenwriter. He has that one ambition. He has finally

                  <p class="noindent">We had our center in Jackson, Mississippi, where the guild had an office for almost three years, I believe. I'm starting in
                     with this project. I went there for— I was there for three weeks, taking depositions. Most of the depositions were depositions
                     of registrars of voters. We would go into a little community, and—we had subpoena power—subpoena the registrar of voters,
                     under this act, and examine their records.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Just found a pattern of grossest, grossest discrimination by the registrars. Even when blacks came in, they would— The level
                     of literacy for both blacks and whites was astoundingly low. Even people who registered, who were schoolteachers—blacks and
                     whites—could barely write, and who then— But all of the whites would get passed, regardless of, you know, if they could only
                     make a cross, but the blacks would be disqualified for any reason. And then they had a right to ask them certain questions.
                     They would ask the whites the simple questions and the blacks questions they couldn't answer, so that you really had to be
                     a very highly qualified person in order, as a black, in order to get registered. We established that through these depositions.

                  <p class="noindent">And then I was selected to take Governor [Ross] Barnett's deposition, because the registrars were all appointed by him, and
                     he, of course, appointed registrars who would do this. We spent a day taking his deposition. Some of the towns where we went,
                     it was very scary, but the governor had put out bulletins saying nothing must happen to the lawyers, because we were acting
                     on behalf of Congress on this thing. So actually nothing ever happened to us.

                     to be done to frighten us. I remember, for example, one of the small places. We were meeting in a courtroom, and we asked
                     if we— There was a lunch break, and we decided— Oh, there was a strike going on in that community. There was— What kind of
                     a plant? I forget what kind of a plant there was, but there was a strike going on. There were workers, hard-hat workers, all
                     over the place, and they were just so hostile. And so everywhere you went there was a crowd. And when the noon break came,
                     we said to the attorneys on the other side, to whoever was representing the city there, whether we could stay in the room.
                     They said okay. And then one of the attorneys came over, after they walked out, and said, "You better get out of here. You
                     better be out in the open where you can be seen. A very dangerous thing here."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">So we did go out. We went through a very hostile crowd and found a restaurant. We were served, but reluctantly. But you could
                     just feel the hostility. I think but for the governor's order, there isn't any question that we would have been attacked.

                     people to go, raising funds, and you know, doing that kind of thing.

                     But while the deposition was being taken, he could not say "Negro", yet he didn't want to say "nigger." He was struggling
                     with the word, and it came out "niggra," you know, it was just— And every time a little bit different. But just having the

                     Certainly by the early sixties— Well, the guild has now become a venerable organization, having been founded back in 1937.
                     But I'm wondering— Obviously, the activism of the early sixties represented a, finally, sort of an opening up of ability to
                     conduct political activity after the long period of the McCarthy era. What did this new activism, in the early sixties, mean
                     in terms of development of the guild, recruiting of new members, and so forth?

                  <p class="noindent">That happened during— You know, during the McCarthy period, the attorney general created a list of, quote, "subversive organizations,"
                     unquote. He gave the guild notice that he intended to place it on the list of subversive organizations. The guild had a hearing
                     before him, and he persisted in his intention. An action was filed, court action was filed, and an injunction was issued,
                     temporary injunction or preliminary injunction, to prevent him from so listing the organization. Eventually, the proceeding
                     was dropped, and the guild was never listed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But the proceeding went on over a period, I'm not sure how long, but maybe eight, ten, twelve years. During that period, a
                     number of things happened to the guild. First of all, the guild abandoned its student chapters for the very sound reasons
                     that while the guild was being so threatened, any student who became a member of the guild might face great difficulty in
                     becoming admitted to the bar, and the guild didn't want to be responsible for that. Also, new members were hard to come by.
                     As a matter of fact, there was no campaign really carried on for new members because of the fear of joining a — Although it
                     hadn't been listed as a subversive organization, for all practical purposes, it was treated as though it had been listed as
                     a subversive organization. And so lawyers just weren't about to join that. They were afraid of disbarment; they were afraid
                     of all kinds of things. Finally, a great many members dropped away for essentially the same reasons. There was just a tight
                     core of, probably, I'm sure, less than a thousand lawyers in the whole United States

                     </div>who belonged to the guild, maybe closer to five hundred, in all of the country. I think in Los Angeles it got down to somewhere
                     in the neighborhood of fifty, something like that. Nevertheless, the guild continued to be active in all kinds of things,
                     continued to function, although it couldn't be as active as it had been otherwise.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Well, when it was announced that the attorney general was abandoning his attempt to place the guild on the subversive list,
                     the situation began to change, and change rather sharply. The guild at that point began slowly—it didn't happen overnight—to
                     again recruit members and to establish student chapters. And it became more respectable. I don't remember when that happened,
                     but I think it was in the very late fifties or early sixties that this happened. The guild activity increased considerably.
                     Then a new— In the sixties, from the mid-sixties on, a new tendency began to develop in the guild among young lawyers, an
                     ultra— What one might call an ultra-Left tendency. The leadership of that group on a national basis was in the hands primarily
                     of a woman, young woman lawyer, who later went underground with the Weatherpeople [Weather Underground]. What was her name?

                     And so a couple of them—we gave them the money to go. They disappeared, and they never did any of the things. They just went
                     their own way and spent the money.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I remember we had an office—our office was on Sixth Street at that time—and they asked if they could have a caucus meeting
                     at our office one night. We told them yes, they could. We came in the next morning, and the office was literally a shambles—chairs
                     turned over, food all over the place. It was a pigpen that they had turned it into. Never an apology, never an explanation.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">They were very disruptive at the convention itself. Well, just one example, we had a— At that time, the guild had a lot of
                     community support and sold tickets. It was a money-raising affair, and we sold tickets to a lot of nonguild people, people
                     in the community. People wanted to sit together at certain tables, so we made seating arrangements. And they said that—this
                     group said they were opposing it. It was not democratic, but the decision—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">"No, we are running it." And we said, "This is the way it's got to be. We promised people; it's going to be."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And so they continue to oppose it. Then on the evening of the banquet, as soon as the doors were opened, they rushed in, occupied
                     tables: a few at each table, all over the place, so that the seating arrangements became impossible. It was just that kind
                     of constant harassment that they were engaged in. And it created a lot of problems in the guild. Again, it created for a period
                     a crisis in the guild, [so] that people, a lot of people, thought of dropping out, or becoming inactive, because it was too
                     disagreeable.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">This went on into the seventies and began to take a somewhat different turn. Bernadine and her people went underground, and,
                     you know, the thing became— They were no longer present in the guild—her leadership. She was a

                     </div>very powerful leader. She really, you know, over those young people, had a lot of control. She was looked up to. She's very
                     bright. These were not stupid people; they're very bright people.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But a new tendency began to develop, breaks between the young and the old on an entirely different level. The guild had always
                     been strictly a lawyers organization, and the young people said, "That's elitist. We want to make it an organization like
                     a union. Have anybody who works in connection with the law." Secretaries, paralegals (oh, they were just beginning at that
                     time), whoever worked—messengers—whoever worked in the office. The old people said, "We're not, we're a professional organization.
                     We want to maintain our position as that, and we're affiliated with other organizations that are professional organizations."
                     That kind of thing was a cause of great— In addition to that, a peculiar thing happened during that period. The guild had
                     always functioned not only as a lawyers organization, but as lawyers. We wrote <i>amicus</i> briefs; we drafted legislation; we tried cases. Our activities— We might participate in a demonstration here and there, but
                     that was not a central activity. Our central activities were lawyers' activities. The theory was that we could do certain
                     things that others couldn't do, and that was our function.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">There was an interesting period, when young people were flocking into the legal profession, and wanted no part of the law.
                     What they wanted to make out of the guild was entirely a political organization. Should it be a strictly political organization,
                     which was engaged in political activities, consisting of people in the legal—connected with the law? Those were the areas
                     of struggle that were going on. Many of us were attacked quite viciously within the guild—I don't mean physically attacked—within
                     the guild. A lot of people, most, by the end of the seventies, I would say 90 percent of the older people had dropped out,
                     or 80 percent had dropped out.
                  </p>

                  <p class="noindent">There was a convention in Colorado, at the University of Colorado. I think in '76; I'm not sure of the year. And these tendencies,
                     the struggle, that would struggle— And the young people prevailed on every point, because the guild had been growing, and
                     they substantially outnumbered the older lawyers. While the older lawyers, I would say 95 percent of them, stood together,
                     maybe only 70 percent of the younger lawyers stood together. Nevertheless, that 70 percent outnumbered the rest of the people
                     The constitution was amended to permit membership on the basis that they wanted. The program at the convention, what was discussed
                     mostly was our political character. Demonstrations and so forth. The legal activity as such, of the guild, just about disappeared.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Following that, there began to be a gradual change back. First of all, as far as the membership of others [was] concerned,
                     for the most part, they didn't join. I would suppose today maybe 10 percent or 5 percent of the guild consists of nonlawyers.
                     Oh, one of the issues was whether students would have full voting rights. In practice, that worked out. First of all, some
                     of the legal workers became active and very good members of the guild, but for the most part they weren't there. It was still
                     a lawyers— It remained basically a lawyers organization, simply because it was lawyers who belonged. As far as students were
                     concerned, they had their own groups in the universities. And as a practical matter, they didn't participate very much with
                     the lawyers, although it was always a connection that cooperated. So that became a nonissue. Gradually, bit by bit, the guild
                     began to return, as these people, these young people, began to get a little older and a little more experienced in the law.
                     They were good people, they weren't bad people. They turned more and more to doing legal things. And I would say today, while
                     the guild is interested in, and does participate in, demonstrations to a reasonable—no, to a substantial extent—its main activities
                     are what I would call lawyers' activities. This sort of gives you a

                     of whatever struggles were going on on the Left. During the civil rights days, it was civil rights activities. During the
                     Vietnam War, it was antiwar, antidraft, that kind of thing—prolabor. And so that on where the guild stood. Particularly on
                     domestic issues there were no problems. The manner of working on those issues were where the problems were, but those have
                     largely been solved. [telephone rings, tape recorder off] Are you interested in other areas of differences within the guild?

                     an anti-Soviet tone. Whenever a resolution was posed, they tried to introduce into the resolution something of an anti-Soviet

                     or three other fringe groups besides the October League. I think there was one that grew out of it. In any event, that has
                     pretty much disappeared in the last two or three years. I must caution you on one thing: my time judgments are likely to be
                     the most unreliable thing that I tell you.

                     if they are, they're not active—who has that extreme anti-Soviet tendency, the ones on the other side don't push their position
                     too much, although they're still there. And, by and large, that has ceased to be an area of confrontation. I think that today,
                     the guild is very well unified. Not that there aren't differences of opinion on things, but they aren't really basic, you
                     know, the kind of differences of opinion that cause dissension and difficulty within an organization.

                     that the guild was active in the antiwar movement. What were some of the activities that the guild was involved in around
                     the war in Vietnam? For example, did you get involved in any of the legal challenges to the war, so forth?

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, there were legal challenges, but those were mostly conducted—they were all conducted in the East, in Washington, mostly.
                     We, from time to time, helped write briefs, <i>amicus</i> briefs, and did research and consulted. But the activity was much more centered, that kind of activity is much more centered—
                     One of the things that the guild did: a lot of draft counseling. We did a lot of speaking against the [war].
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">One activity that was carried on under auspices other than the guild, because it was possible to do it on a somewhat broader
                     basis, we formed a lawyers committee against the war in Vietnam. What had happened was that we started to form such a committee
                     here. We were concerned basically with the domestic constitutional violations—no declaration of war and various other violations—and
                     we were going to put out a paper on it. We were going to mention also the violations of international law, but it wasn't the
                     basic thrust.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">When we learned that there was a group composed largely of guild lawyears in New York who were doing a similar job, but were
                     concentrating basically upon the international aspects—and they had some of the leading international law professors and so
                     forth, working with them—the two committees combined and became the Lawyers Committee Against the War in Vietnam. We put out
                     a kind of a pamphlet that wasn't a pamphlet form, it was more like an article, which combined all of the arguments, from a
                     legal standpoint, all of the arguments against the war in Vietnam. We had that— We got a congressman, I

                     way to get this—and distributed it among lawyers throughout the country. At the time, it received a lot of recognition in
                     the press and elsewhere, and we think was one of hundreds of activities that made some contribution toward the fight against
                     the war. As a matter of fact, I think during the war I spent more time on that committee than any other single activity, because
                     it was the planning of the thing, it was the organizing, it was getting out the distribution, and speaking that resulted from
                     it, and so forth.

                     FBI, which, as I understand, has been going on for a number of years— In addition to that, which I do want you to talk about,
                     were there any other activities during the Watergate era that the guild was involved in, that were sort of particular to that
                     period of time when revelations about government malfeasance, government spying, and so forth were going on? In other words,
                     I guess the question really is, did the Watergate era indicate any particular activities for the guild, around things that
                     were going on then?

                     that the Washington chapter of the guild did more. Certain activities were more concentrated, and still are more concentrated,
                     in the East than they are here, particularly the national legislative matters and national problems of that kind. I can't
                     remember anything that the guild did, either nationally or locally, outside of some resolutions.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes, I think it was started six or seven years ago. I have forgotten, I knew at one time, what led to its starting, but I
                     think it may have been during the Watergate days that it came out indirectly, in some way, that there'd been wiretapping of
                     the guild, offices broken into, and so forth. And so the guild had filed an action, in New York I guess it was, in the federal
                     court, for damages and to enjoin the FBI from doing certain things: wiretapping, breaking and entering, using informers at
                     meetings, etcetera, etcetera. There have been— The amount of legal work that has been done on the case has been absolutely
                     enormous. There have probably been an average of two lawyers working full-time ever since the suit was filed. The first thing,
                     of course, was the discovery. And I think even before the action was filed, under the information —

                     I've talked about, of all kinds of illegal activities directed against the guild. The discovery— The fight that has been going
                     on during this time has largely been around the issue of discovery, of what facts we can discover. Just tons of material have
                     been uncovered, and there's been a special master appointed by the court in New York to handle this discovery.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Now, the present status, as I understand it, is that the government has filed a demurrer to the action, which is an attempt
                     to throw it out of the court on the grounds that, even if all of these things are true, there is no power to sue the government,
                     that the FBI has the right to do all of these things, or even if it doesn't have the right, the only remedy lies with Congress.
                     Now, the reason that this was not done earlier is because as long as you had a halfway liberal, or decent, Supreme Court,
                     such a thing had no chance of success. But with the present Supreme Court— [interruption by a visitor] With the present Supreme

                     same tendency is going on in the legal profession as elsewhere: the firms are getting bigger and bigger, and smaller firms,
                     many of them, are having more and more difficulty. This is caused by a lot of things: one is, laws become much more complex;
                     the need for mechanized equipment, computers, and so forth, which many small offices can't afford; the inability of small
                     offices to advertise; many other problems. We're setting up a committee now to explore the question of setting up a guild
                     cooperative in which guild lawyers, small lawyers, small offices—single, or two, or three, or four or five lawyers—can join
                     this cooperative, which will have a reference service and advertise on behalf of all of the groups, and various offices can
                     specialize. It's only in its early stages, but that's a very important project, I believe, for the guild to engage in.

                  <p class="noindent">Ben, I've gotten the impression from some things that we've talked about off tape that beginning perhaps, oh, around the late
                     fifties, or early sixties, that your law firm began to go through an evolution, where you were not so much involved in strictly
                     political cases, defense cases, and so forth, but you began to perhaps broaden out, in the types of activities that your law
                     firm was involved in. At least, that's an impression I've gotten. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about the development
                     of the firm over these years.
                  </p><br>
                  
                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Yes, all right. I came here in 1943 and helped to establish the firm which was then the firm of Katz, Gallagher, and Margolis.
                     That was Charles [J.] Katz, Leo Gallagher, and myself. It was a labor law firm with eleven lawyers. Represented all of the
                     CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations] unions in Southern California. As a matter of fact, I was induced to move from
                     San Francisco in order to help set up that firm. I would say 80 percent of the work consisted of labor matters, trade union
                     matters; another 15 percent of workers compensation matters; here and there, a personal injury matter, very rarely; and maybe
                     5 percent of civil liberties and similar matters, like, for example, the Sleepy Lagoon case during that time. That continued
                     until about 1947.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">At that time, there was a split in the CIO, with unions getting kicked out and some withdrawing. As a result, we continued
                     to represent the unions that left the CIO, but none of the unions that stayed in the CIO would have anything to do with us.
                     [telephone rings, tape recorder off] This left us with a relatively small labor practice, and we had— That was our major practice.
                     At that time,
                     
                     <hr class="pb">
                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">484</span> ―
                     </div>coincidentally, a flood of a different kind of work started to come in, to wit, civil liberties work, arising out of the beginning
                     of the McCarthy period and beginning, among others, with the Hollywood Nineteen, who became the Hollywood Ten. So that over
                     the next several years, two things happened so far as our office was concerned. Number one, the size of the office was drastically
                     cut down to, as I remember it, about five lawyers. John [T.] McTernan and I for a number of years did virtually nothing except
                     work arising out of the McCarthy era. The other lawyers in the office, in addition, did some, particularly John Porter, who
                     was very active in the immigration and deportation field. That continued until about 1957 when— There were periods in between
                     when John and I occasionally did a few other things, but not very much. Fortunately we had accumulated—because we didn't live
                     high—a little money, and we were able to survive during this period. But by that time, by 1957 or so, we were not only broke,
                     but in debt. And the demand in civil liberties cases to some extent was easing up. In any event, we had to try to make a living.
                     So we turned to general practice, continuing what little, relatively little, labor work we had, and began to get other kinds
                     of work, largely in the personal injury field. Our practice really, as soon as John and I got back into it and started giving
                     it attention, developed fairly well and quite rapidly.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">An interesting thing that we observed at that time was that the practice that we developed came almost exclusively, with a
                     few exceptions, came from nonpolitical people. The political people who had law business, by and large, stayed away from us—and
                     by political people, I mean those who are on the same side as we were—which is something we always resented a great deal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But we built our practice. From that time on, while we of course continued to handle civil rights cases and civil liberties
                     cases, they were not the major part of our practice. They were the minor part of our practice. The major part of our

                     <div align="center">― <span class="run-head">485</span> ―
                     </div>practice was the money-making practice. We were trying to— We got out of debt and began to get on our feet. The practice continued
                     along those lines for a number of years. And then gradually what happened is that the types of— We became more and more a
                     litigation office in all kinds of fields: in entertainment law, in business law, in maritime cases (which was a major source
                     of our business), in other personal injury cases, malpractice cases. And the cases we were handling got bigger and bigger,
                     until, by about seven or eight years ago, we were handling only major litigation, at least what was for us major litigation.
                     When we handled the small cases, it was only because some old client or so insisted that we do it. We have been engaged in
                     all kinds of litigation since that time, and we now no longer do any labor work. One of the attorneys who was in our office
                     has gone and has become house counsel for ILWU [International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union], Local 26, the warehouse
                     local, which was our principal labor client. We send him all of the labor work. He's their house counsel and does all of the
                     labor work, simply because our office was no longer set up for the day-to-day, routine labor work. However, I may have, to
                     some extent, not been entirely accurate in what I said, because we do handle quite a number of large labor-matter litigation,
                     like we have a big case of engineers who were laid off by RCA [Radio Corporation of America], involving two or three million
                     dollars in termination pay. We have other substantial labor litigation, but we cannot consider ourselves labor lawyers, because
                     we do not do the day-to-day trade union work anymore. We continue to do other kinds of work. We look out for the kinds of
                     work that has a public interest. We have just finished a case against a slumlord, which has sort of set a precedent [<i>Hernandez</i> v. <i>Stabach</i>].

                  <p class="noindent">Now, when you first began to go into personal injury and other cases like that, this development first began that you described,
                     did you have any problems at all because of your reputation as a political law firm?
                  </p><br>

                  <p class="noindent">Not really. In the first place, our original sources were mainly from people we knew. We weren't getting it from the labor
                     movement, but people we knew in the labor movement, people who knew us. We got around and made it known we were available.
                     And then we were quite successful, and they started referring other people.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We had a very interesting experience as far as the courts were concerned, which relates somewhat to the political people not
                     coming to us. They wouldn't come to us, because they were afraid of the answer to the question you asked. We found a peculiar
                     thing: we have in the political cases been kicked around from pillar to post, particularly in the trial courts. Where we won,
                     we won practically all our cases on appeal. And in the trial courts, we were treated so badly. I could tell you incident after
                     incident of unbelievable conduct on the part of trial judges. These very same judges, when we appeared before them on nonpolitical
                     matters, leaned over backwards: gave us the best kind of breaks.

                  <p class="noindent">One of them, who had given us the worst kind of runaround, appointed me as counsel, where he had an opportunity, in a big
                     air crash case, where I made, oh, I think, close to a couple hundred thousand dollars in fees. He needn't have appointed me,
                     and he had been unbelievably bad in the political case. I often feel they had a guilty conscience. Also, I think they respected
                     us, because they knew we had done a good job in the political cases. But we were traded—

                     </div>we had cases before him, and he embarrassed us sometimes. I remember one occasion. He was a very tough judge with everybody;
                     he treated people very arbitrarily. And I remember one day appearing before him. Laws and motions—there were lots of matters—were
                     being heard. People were asking for continuances, giving very good excuses. Nobody got a continuance. And I needed some time
                     on a case. I got up, and I started to say, "I, I need a little more time, your honor."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "How much time do you need?"</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And he gave it to me. And that's without asking another question, while he had denied every other request before him. It made
                     me [laughs] feel very uneasy, but I think it was just his feeling of guilt.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">But it indicates that the people who stayed away from us in nonpolitical cases had no reason to do so. I cannot really think
                     of any instances where [we] have been treated badly by a judge in nonpolitical cases because of our political background.
                     You sometimes get treated badly by judges because of the kind of judges they are. They are very reactionary. They are, let's
                     say, in personal injury cases, they are pro defense, or things of that kind, but they treat all plaintiffs' lawyers the same
                     way. Also, when you're up against one of the real big offices, there are many judges who tend to scrape and bow to the big
                     offices, and you have a tough time. But, by and large, we have been treated not just as well as other counsel in nonpolitical
                     cases, but better than most.

                     you recall a case which, I believe, went to the California Supreme Court in the early seventies, I think it was about 1972,
                     <i>Gyerman</i> v. <i>U.S. Lines.</i> This case apparently involved an issue of worker negligence and working in an unsafe place.

                  <b>Margolis</b>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Yes, it was a very technical decision, but a very important one. In maritime cases, there are two kinds of—two bases for liability.
                     One is called <i>negligence,</i> where you have to prove carelessness. And the other is called <i>unseaworthiness,</i> in which all you have to prove is that there was a dangerous condition, regardless of whether the dangerous condition resulted
                     from the negligence of the employer. In other words, it might have been due to nobody's fault, and yet the employer is liable,
                     simply because the place was dangerous.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">It had never been settled where there was a method of work used by the employer—the procedure that he followed—where <i>that</i> was dangerous, whether unseaworthiness applied to that. Unseaworthiness was applied, let's say, to grease on a deck, to a
                     condition. It generally applied to a condition. We argued, in this case, that a work method actually created an unsafe condition
                     and unseaworthiness applied. We were sustained in the Ninth Circuit [Court of Appeals], and it's a very, in that field, a
                     very important decision.

                     I don't remember the details, which was clearly a dangerous method. But it was a method that had been typically followed by
                     many boat owners. We would have had a hard time winning on negligence. But they found— What happened was the court refused
                     to give us an instruction that unseaworthiness applied. We took it up on appeal. It was reversed, and, as I remember, we settled
                     the case.

                  <p class="noindent">Yes. That was work done in conjunction with the [National Lawyers] Guild, the Los Angeles chapter of the guild. There was
                     near hysteria in the courts at that time. People were being arrested at the drop of a hat. There was almost something like
                     a kind of a civil war going on. Not that there was that much shooting, but in the way people were being treated. We volunteered
                     to defend people who had been arrested, among other things, to get them released on bail or without bail. Because a lot of
                     people that were being arrested were of the kind that wouldn't ordinarily qualify for being released without bail. What was
                     happening is the jails were getting more overcrowded than usual, and they were throwing them in. So we went in, and we did
                     succeed in getting some of the judges to be more liberal, to release a lot of the people without bail. That was the main thing
                     we did.

                  <p class="noindent">What happened on that occasion was that there was a committee organized on the West Coast, in Los Angeles, to prepare a brief
                     on the unconstitutionality of the war. And originally we were, I think— I sometimes get confused as to just how it developed.
                     I think originally we were approaching the question from a standpoint of international law, violations of various principles
                     of international law. And we learned that there was another committee in New York, friends of mine, people I knew, who were
                     doing the same thing, but approaching it from the standpoint of its legality under the U.S. Constitution. Now, we ended up
                     working together and doing work in both areas. I may be confused, that maybe it's reversed as to where it was started. But
                     in any event, one committee was working on one angle, and another on another angle. We learned about the work; we got together.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">We worked jointly and got out a report. One aspect of the report dealt primarily with the constitutionality of the war, because
                     there'd been no declaration of war. I don't remember all the details, but various illegal things that various presidents had
                     done in violating various statutes. The main constitutional question was no declaration of war, but there were a number of
                     other things, details of which I've forgotten.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Then, the other aspect was of international law, which again had a number of points, but fundamentally was predicated on the
                     charter of the United Nations, which, of course, is a treaty. And under our Constitution, any treaty to which the United States
                     is a party is the supreme law of the land. We made an argument [telephone rings, tape recorder off] that the United Nations
                     treaty rendered the war in Vietnam illegal, because it was an aggressive war and

                     the Congressional Record—this paper. I think Wayne Morse, if I remember right, had it printed in the Congressional Record.
                     He was a senator from Oregon at that time. And then we had something like a hundred thousand copies made and distributed to
                     lawyers and to others throughout the United States. And we thought it— And it was referred to in newspapers and in magazine
                     articles, and we thought it had considerable usefulness in the fight against the war.

                     And he did it entirely on his own as an individual effort. That was thrown out of court at the trial level and, what we say,

                     were charged with contempt of court for what they had done in court. And I participated in writing briefs on appeal in support

                     in a report, January 13, 1971, that you had some involvement in the case that the Black Panther Party, here in Los Angeles,

                     during that period of time, the counsel for the Panthers, Black Panthers. Charlie and I had been friends for many years, as
                     a matter of fact, even before he was admitted to practice law. [knock at the door, tape recorder off] Charles had been a client
                     of our San Francisco office. He had a dry cleaners association of which he was

                     who had been really persecuted and treated terribly badly by the police. I then began— I agreed to do so.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I spent a tremendous amount of time on preparing and filing a complaint, which involved, which set forth, if I remember correctly,
                     sixty or seventy separate incidents of police violation of Black Panthers' rights. I did this as the result of a number of
                     conferences with many Black Panthers, who gave me that information. I remember spending a great deal of time. One of the reasons
                     I remember the amount of time is because of what happened afterwards. We filed the case. We proceeded to move along with the
                     case, and it came time where we needed further cooperation of the Panthers for further information, taking of depositions,
                     etcetera, etcetera. We got absolutely zero cooperation. They wouldn't reply to my telephone calls. They just disappeared as
                     far as the case was concerned. I finally had to drop the case, because I couldn't handle the case without their cooperation.
                     And the reason I remember it so well is because I just hated all that work going down the tubes, as it did. When we filed
                     the case, it got a good deal of publicity, but never followed through.

                     Black Panthers were either honored, or were— There was some program around them. I don't remember just what. But the Black
                     Panthers were an important part of the convention, of the lawyers convention. And I, in going to that convention, I went to
                     San Francisco first. Then flew to New York with Charlie and a number of members of the Black Panthers. I remember that Charlie
                     got a room, or two or three rooms, connected. And I had an experience with them, which, again, kind of turned me off on them.

                     time that they left. And what they were doing— I don't know where the money came from, but what they were doing is they were
                     ordering bottles of booze from the hotel. I myself generally get something in my room, but I go outside and buy it, because
                     something you'll pay eight dollars for at a store, you'll pay twenty-five for in the hotel. And they were buying them from
                     the hotel, ordering fancy food sent up, and it was just— I don't know how much money they spent. And I, I was sort of turned
                     off by the whole business, which happened, it may be more so, because it happened about the time I wasn't getting any cooperation
                     from them in connection with the work that I did. It made me doubtful about some of these people, although I know at the same
                     time there were a lot of things that they did that were good and useful.

                     to us, or else." That some of that went on.

                     also know that they did good things with the money. They, you know, they had schools for the children, they fed children,
                     and they did those kind of things. So when I got through, I felt that they were an organization that did some good things,
                     but that they weren't on a solid foundation, on a principled, solid foundation that would last.

                     I don't remember. And they told me about this young Mexican lad [Trinidad Iglesias], who was at that time, I think, just around
                     twenty-one, who was in jail, charged with first-degree murder—and the death penalty was still in effect in those days—who
                     was charged with murdering a policeman. And in fact, he had killed the policeman. I think he had a public defender, and the
                     public defender, he was sure, would sell him out. They asked if I would go out and represent him. I told them that I would
                     consider it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I went out, went to the jail and had a discussion with him. Found him a rather remarkable young man, who was, while very poorly
                     educated, inadequately educated, was very bright and had very good instincts. His record showed that his big problem was that
                     he didn't have any judgment as to when to resist and when not to resist, that he was always in trouble, because he wouldn't
                     take being kicked around. And if he's being kicked around by sixteen policemen, he'd fight them all. That was the— You know,
                     no judgment in that sense. And this was a— It also turned out that this was a boy who, since he was eleven or twelve years
                     old up to the time I saw him in jail, had probably spent no more than three or four months, at one time, outside of jail or
                     juvenile youth camp or one of those places. And probably in the eight or ten years, not more than a year and a half altogether
                     out of jail. He was constantly getting out and going back in.

                  <p class="noindent">He told me the following story of the incident that occurred. He said that he— Oh, he was a member of a gang, too, had been
                     a member of a gang for a number of years. That was a Sunday, and he and his gang were in a park when, according to the story
                     he told me, there were several other gangs also meeting in the park. One gang, a short distance from them, but where they

                     other gang, but between members of that other gang. Somebody called the police—not them—and the police started coming.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">Everybody, from <i>all</i> of the gangs, started running, because, as he said, whenever anything happened, the police had a practice of picking up every
                     young Mexican in the area. And so he ran, and he was followed by a police officer. He jumped some fences, and then ran around
                     through the backyard of the home of a friend of his, where he had been before, and came through the house and out to the front
                     porch.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">The policeman followed him and caught him there on the porch and started grappling with him. And they— You know, trying to
                     place him under arrest, and he resisted, as he always did whenever he thought that it wasn't justified. They grappled, they
                     fell off the porch and onto the ground, were rolling around on the ground. And he was getting the better of the officer. He
                     had the officer under him, and he was on top of the officer. He felt the officer pulling at his gun, in his holster, at his
                     side. And somehow, during the course of it, he took away the gun of the officer, stood above the officer, who was still on
                     the ground, and fired three shots into him and killed him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">I asked him, you know, if whether— What he intended to do? Why did he do it?</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">He said, "I just blew my mind. I really, you know, I just realized that I'd done it after I did it."</p>
                  
                  <p class="noindent">And then he ran away about two blocks and was caught. There was never any question that he had killed the officer and that
                     the incident, pretty much as I've described it, occurred.

                  <p class="noindent">Los Angeles police officer. I was so impressed with him as a person, and it looked like he might get the death penalty, that
                     I agreed to represent him. First of all, I went to the district attorney's office and tried to make a deal. My main purpose
                     in the deal was to avoid the death penalty, because once you've killed a police officer— And here, he stood above this police
                     officer and fired three shots down into him, while the police officer was helpless, disarmed and helpless on the ground. That's,
                     that's pretty tough, pretty tough situation. The district attorney refused to bargain. What happened, however, is that while
                     the trial was in progress, the [California] Supreme Court decision came down, declaring the death penalty unconstitutional.
                     So he could never— At the outset when I tried to bargain, he could have been given death. But by the time, I think, we were
                     in the middle of the trial, he could no longer be given the death penalty. What I did is I prepared a defense of diminished
                     capacity. The theory of the defense [door opens] was that— Excuse me, let me get this. [tape recorder off] The theory of the
                     defense was diminished capacity. He had been abused so much by the police that there had been built up in him a feeling of
                     anger and resentment because of the abuse. And that when this incident happened, under the tremendous stress, all of this
                     exploded, and he really wasn't aware of what he was doing. All of this resentment against the past exploded, and didn't then—
                     Doesn't know what happened to him. I got a professor from UCLA, who was Mexican and who was an expert in the field (he was
                     a psychiatrist), and I got a psychologist who worked for the city, or the county, out in that area, to go along with me to
                     be my expert witnesses. And I did an unusual thing. Ordinarily, in the case of this kind, you try to keep out the defendant's
                     record, because he had a record this long. And ordinarily what happens is when you have a record—

                     instances. And about how in each of these instances he was kicked around by the police, and how this built up. And then had
                     him testify that everything went black. And I had the experts testify to this diminished-capacity business.

                  <p class="noindent">I had an interesting job. It took us about two weeks to select the jury, because I had an interesting problem in selecting
                     the jury, in that about half of the jury panel was Mexican, but middle-class Mexican. And I learned from just talking to people
                     that, generally speaking, most of the middle-class Mexicans were very resentful of, particularly, gangs and the poorer Mexicans.
                     They thought they injured them and their reputations and their abilities to go ahead. So that I did a— Used the two weeks
                     to really try to educate these people about discrimination and how it affected them.

                  <p class="noindent">We tried the case. We put out this evidence, and then the prosecution made a classical mistake. We must have had eight or
                     nine incidents that [he] testified about. They called the police to contradict his testimony on each of those eight or nine
                     incidents. In every instance, they called two or more policemen concerning that incident, and we, of course, had the opportunity
                     to cross-examine them. And in every incident there were numerous contradictions between the police officers. If they'd had
                     only one police officer, then it would have been his [Iglesias's] word against the police officer's word in each case. But
                     because they put more than one officer, trying to build their case— The fact of the matter is, I said, you couldn't believe
                     any of them on these things.

                  <p class="noindent">The result was the jury was out for several days, and brought in a conviction for voluntary manslaughter, in what was really
                     a first-degree murder case.

                     least to some extent, his story and, to some extent, the diminished capacity. But the question was, how diminished was it?
                     And so, originally, they divided six to six: six for second-degree murder and six for innocent. Actually got six votes for
                     innocent. And interestingly enough, on the jury there were six Mexicans, and they divided three and three. Three were among
                     the ones favoring the prosecution. But the worst that anybody wanted was second-degree murder. They finally compromised on
                     voluntary manslaughter.

                  <p class="noindent">About three or four years ago, both John and I decided to go on half-time. What we planned to do was not necessarily to spend
                     much less time in the office, because John and I are both well and wanted to be active. We wanted to be free to devote much
                     more time to political and social things, but also have the feeling if— And to take on no new cases of any kind. And to act,
                     except for old cases that we were still involved in, to act primarily as assistant to others. Thus, for example, I recently
                     participated in a trial against a slumlord, lasted eleven weeks, twelve weeks, but the main responsibility was carried by
                     Barbara Hadsell. I participated in a secondary capacity to a certain extent, although for certain reasons, because of my experience,
                     I had to take the lead. But basically the responsibility for the case, main responsibility, was hers. The fact is that you
                     just keep getting— It's very hard to be in a law office and work on a half-time basis. We constantly keep getting involved
                     in other things. You have observed, when you're here, what happens with the phone keeping ringing. I

                     </div>have a brother [Harry Margolis] who's practicing law in Saratoga [California]. Several years ago, he was indicted by the IRS
                     [Internal Revenue Service] on the charge of— For tax charge. He was a tax lawyer, and I helped him on his trial. Spent a lot
                     of time. He was acquitted on all counts. They're after him again, and I'm involved in that again. There's always a lot of
                     things happening, and we keep getting kidded, because actually we're working more than half-time. Although it is a fact that
                     aside from the cases, the old cases, which are still taking a lot of time, some of them, we're not taking responsibility for
                     new cases. The major responsibility is always with somebody else, and we act in an advisory capacity and so forth. So they
                     kid us about our retirement, because both John and I are here nine to five or six, most times. But I'm doing a lot of other
                     things, too, like this oral history is an example.

                  <p class="noindent">Right. [laughs] Well, this hopefully has been a nice break for you on some days. As you think back, and, of course, we had
                     an interruption of several months which makes it more difficult to remember, but as you think back over what we've talked
                     about for many hours now, do you feel that there are any, perhaps, important omissions that we've made, things that we should
                     have talked about?

                  <p class="noindent">Right. Okay. I think the last question I'll ask you is, as we've gone through this process of going back, remembering the
                     things that you've done in your life, and the things that have happened, have there been any things that have sort of either
                     surprised you or been particularly meaningful to you, in terms of remembering things over the years that perhaps you hadn't
                     thought about for quite a while?

                  <p class="noindent">Not exactly that. I really appreciate the opportunity to have done this, and found it very useful. Because, while I think
                     I've expressed feelings that

                     </div>I've held for some time, that weren't developed yesterday, they were feelings that, for the most part, I was not required
                     to formulate. You know, I wasn't expressing those feelings toward them. And many of the things that I've told you— I haven't
                     gone around talking to people about my changes of mind and history. Although what I told you isn't something that happened
                     just now.

                  <p class="noindent">It was— And so it helped sort of clarify. You know, when you talk about something that you think about, you clarify the thing
                     in your own mind. So it did serve that useful purpose. I feel a little clearer about where I stand, and where I stood, than
                     if I hadn't expressed myself in my discussions with you. And for that, I thank you.
