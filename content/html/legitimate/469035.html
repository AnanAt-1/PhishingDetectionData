THE SCALES OF COLEOPTERA. 


BY GEORGE DIMMOCK, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 


Altho the following paper is mainly 
a description of a few forms of scales 
of coleoptera, on some of which the 
scales have not before been noticed, and 
on others of which they have been more 
or less fully described, a brief outline 
of the history and bibliography of the 
knowledge of the scales of insects in 
general and of coleoptera in particular 
may not be amiss as an introduction to 
these descriptions. 

According to Mayer’ and Schneider? 
the scales of lepidoptera were first 
mentioned, by Fabricius, in 1600, were 
later mentioned by Malpighi, in 1650, 
and since then by many other observers. 
Up to the beginning of the present 
century the literature of this subject is 
of little importance except historically, 
and I will cite only the names of 
Bonanni, Ledermiiller, Réaumur, Résel 
and Swammerdamm, who made men- 
tion, to a greater or less extent, of the

of this subject has increased rapidly,

ties or interstices of the pith-like por- 
tion open into the central canal of 
the hair, but are prevented from direct 
communication with the outer air by 
the thin sheath of chitin which forms 
the outer covering of each hair. Each 
hair is closed at the apex (fig. 1, c) 
by this outer, impervious chitin layer 
and at its basal end (fig. 1, e) by a thick- 
ening of the chitin sheath to such an 


extent as to entirely close the central 


canal, with its surrounding pith-like 
substance, from the outer air. This 


structure, together with the mode of 
closing of the basal end, leaves the 
nature of the development of the hair 
very apparent. It is a closed sacciform 
appendage of the external chitinous cov- 
ering of the insect, as are the scales of 
lepidoptera, and

almost exactly as the corresponding

attached. 

The structural points above described 
were obtained in two ways; first, by 
sectioning the hairs with the microtome, 
and, second, by carefully observing 
under the microscope the action of dif- 
ferent reagents on the hairs. I obtained 
a few good transverse sections of hairs 
taken from the sides of the thorax, and,

The expulsion of the air from these 
hairs, when they were broken at any 
point, was readily effected by chloro- 
form or alcohol, and scarcely less readily 
by glycerin, by turpentin, or even by 
water, but if the hair had not been in-

comes transparent, and is colorless with 
directly transmitted light in all parts 
except where the chitin is thickened to 
close the base; this chitin is slightly 
brown. By obliquely transmitted light, 
obtained by Aubé’s illuminating appar- 
atus, the hairs which have been deprived 
of air exhibit a slightly bluish shade. 
Fig. 1, 6, represents a hair of which the 
distal end has been deprived of air, the 
part from x to yis partly deprived of 
air and the basal portion is still filled 
with air. Sometimes, especially when 
glycerin or turpentin is used to expel the 
air, a part of the air will remain col- 
lected in the central canal (fig. 1, x to _y) 
quite a while after it has left the cavities 
of the pith-like portion. The clearly 
defined outline of this column of air led 
to the suspicion of an open canal, the 


presence of which was later proved by 


sections. 
The hairs from different parts of C. 
dorsalis vary little in form and size. 


Those from the thorax and from the un- 
der side of the abdomen are club-shaped

The basal part forms a

slightly curved, but are so inserted as to 
lie nearly flat on the surface of the insect. 
The hairs (fig. 1, 2) from the anten- 
nae are the smallest of the white hairs 
on C. dorsalis. They are only about 
0.07 mm. long and scarcely 0.01 mm. 
in diameter near the base, from which 
they taper to their acute tip. The long- 
est hairs are those from the labial palpi, 
of which the second joint only is densely 
hairy. These hairs are from 0.30 to 
0.50 mm. long, and about 0.015 mm. in 
diameter near their base, from which 
they taper gradually to a fine, acute 
apex. They are considerably curved 
and slenderly filiform. 

Between and upon the hairs of this 
beetle are yellow, amorphous masses, 
quite transparent, and apparently secre- 
ted from the surface of the insect, altho 
they may be remnants of some matrix in 
which the hairs are packed during the 
pupal state of the insect. Fischer men- 
tions substances of apparently similar 
nature in his dissertation,** and Hagen,® 
in 1882, further discusses them.. These 
masses on C. dorsad?s often take beauti- 
fully clear impressions of the hairs 
themselves, and are insoluble in water, 
alcohol, turpentin, glycerin or chloro- 
form.

rum and parts of the mandibles, all

white portions of C. dorsalzs owe their 
creamy whiteness to the hairs described 
above; these hairs are set on shining, 
cupreous or green-bronze surfaces.

hairs from the same region in C. der-

mm. long and about 0.or mm. in diam-

so abundant. 

Taking the families of coleoptera in

Anthrenus varius, for | have had access

I hope to examine more thoroughly

SCALES OF ANTHRENUS VARIUS. 


The figuration of A. varzus is due, 
like that of A. scrophularéae, to scales 
which do not inbricate. The scales of 
A. vartus (fig. 2, c) are narrower than 
those of A. scrophulartae, being about 
0.05 mm. long by 0.015 mm. wide. In 
color they are either dark brown, yellow 
or white; and they are striate, but the 
striae, about six in number, are rather 
obscured by the presence of much air 
in the scales until the latter are treated 
with liquid reagents. The fine notching 
at the apical end of scales of A. vardus 
is not so evident as it is in those of A. 


scrophulartiae, as can be seen by com-

paring fig. 2, a with fig. 2, c, both of 
which figures are equally enlarged. 

At this point may be noted the pres- 
ence of two sorts of hairs on the larvae 
of certain dermestidae, as described by 
De Geer,® Dujardin® andThevenet, *7-** 
and the existence of scales on the larvae 
of Attagenus pellio, as described and 
figured by Dujardin,” the latter species 
being, so far as I can discover, the only 
coleopteron from the larva of which 
scales are known. 

The scarabaetdae contain a number 
of genera in which scales are the rule 
rather than the exception, and, among 
them, for the first time, comes the con- 
sideration of brilliantly colored scales, 
those of the genus //oplia.

covered with spines or hairs (fig. 3, 6 
and c). The scales upon the legs are 
most variable of all in form; common 
among them are lanceolate forms (fig. 
3, c), covered with fine hairs. The 
average size of the scales is about 0.10 
mm. long by 0.05 mm. wide, and they 
are attached to the insect by a more or 
less prolonged basal portion (fig. 3, 
a-c) ; they lie very flatly pressed upon 
the surface of the insect. 

Most of the scales of the dorsal sur- 
face of the thorax and of the elytra, 
when viewed by transmitted light. are 
bright canary yellow, but many of them 
are tinged with carmine red. Viewed 
by reflected light, or upon a dark back- 
ground, the parts before yellow are 
bluish, or dark and nearly invisible, 
while all the parts before reddish are 
now dark and more or less indistinct 
(or rarely greenish if they were purplish- 
red before). If the stage of the micro- 
scope is now revolved, and the light to

be reflected from the scales is thus 
brought from a different direction in 
regard to the scales, some of the parts 
before dark become bright bluish while 
others just before blue become darkened, 
but in no case do parts of a scale which 
were reddish by transmitted light be- 
come bluish by reflected light. If the 
light is not excluded from above the 
stage of the microscope, when examin- 
ing these scales by transmitted light, 
places will be discovered, where the 
scales are injured or where they are 
turned up at their margins, in which 
bright blue, or rarely green, will be 
seen. In all cases where I speak of 
transmitted light I have excluded the 
light from above the stage of the micro- 
scope, and where I speak of reflected 
light I have excluded light from below 
the stage of the microscope. 

If the scales are in any way injured 
or cracked, as they usually are in re- 
moving them from the insect, water will 
readily enter them and discharge the air 
from them. Scales thus treated with 
water are, by transmitted light, sky blue, 
sometimes tinged with carmine red, the 
latter color being in portions of the 
scales which had not been thoroughly 
penetrated by the water, for while the 
water is entering the scales they become 
reddish for a time before changing to 
blue. Boiling the water a minute 
causes all red to disappear but seems to 
have no further action on the scales ; 
their structure is not altered, as the 
water inside such minute cavities is not 
readily boiled. 
scales that have been treated with water

Glycerin produces nearly the same 
effects in these scales as water does ; its 
action is, however, slower and gives 
more opportunity to examine the scales 
during the process of saturation. Light 
transmitted through scales that 
treated with glycerin is nearly color- 
less, and reflected light from scales 
thoroughly penetrated with glycerin is, 
for the most part, colorless ; sometimes, 
however, it is greenish in spots, and 
these spots are usually where a tinge of

In absolute alcohol the scales show, 
by transmitted light, a more reddish 
tinge than they show in water; in 
chloroform the tinge is more purplish 
than in water, altho the purple is very 
pale; in turpentin and in oil of cloves 
the scales are transparent and colorless. 
Scales moistened with of these 
reagents and put over a dark or black 
surface are light metallic green; if dry 
scales are put over dark surfaces they 
are light metallic blue. Redried from 
water, alcohol or chloroform these scales 
regain their original colors, showing 
that it is a coloration due to the struc- 
ture of the scales and not due to any

this I exposed the scales to dry chlorin 
gas and the color remained unaltered. 
Solutions of chlorin or of hypochlorites 
fail to destroy the coloration, for after 
they are washed out and the scales 
again dried the colors reappear as bright 
as at first. 

Dry scales heated slightly over flame

tion, and, while retaining their form,

become brownish grey by transmitted 
or reflected light; they are apparently 
charred sufficiently to lose their color 
without having their structure greatly 
altered. 

In structure these scales are readily 
seen to be little flattened sacs ; wherever 
they are injured, especially if they are 
broken off near the base, the edges of 
the upper and lower sides appear dis- 
tinctly. The inner structure of these 
scales is not easily discoverable. They 
appear to be filled with a very delicate 
network (fig. 3, @), which is always 
reddish after the yellow has left the 
scales. If glycerin is used as a reagent 
in treating the scales their reddish net- 
work, even in scales originally yellow, 
remains long after the yellow has dis- 
appeared. The yellow occupies the 
interspaces of the network. The net- 
work itself, under high powers, appears 
as if it were caused by retiform designs 
in reddish oil between the layers of the 
scales, but the fact of the reappearance 
of the color after treating the scales with 
solvents for oil, e. ¢@., chloroform, 
shows that it is not oil. From the ap- 
pearance of scales charred to different 
extents I am inclined to think this net- 
work to be formed by thickenings of 
the chitin walls of the scales themselves. 
If this be the case, the thickenings pro- 
ject only inward from these walls, and 
are found in corresponding figures upon 
both upper and under walls of the 
scales. The colors red and yellow by 
transmitted light may exist where only 
the upper or under half of the scale is 
present.

INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH 
VOLUME. 


PsyCHE enters upon its fourth volume 
under auspices in many regards more favor- 
able than those which have attended the 
inauguration of earlier volumes. The mate- 
rial support upon which the CAMBRIDGE 
ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB, as publisher, can 
count, while not sufficient to defray the expen- 
ses of publication, bids fair to leave the friends 
of Psycne with smaller deficits to meet than 
heretofore. The explanation should be made 
that the CLus, while devoting all its available 
means to the publication of Psycue, is obliged 
to rely upon private benefactors to make up 
its arrears of funds from time to time; else it 


would be obliged to suspend the execution of 


its work. The Managing Editor, having faith 
in the good-will of his fellow-entomologists, 
and of patrons of science, assumes the respon- 
sibility of expenditures which exceed the 
resources of the Club. Contributions to the 
Permanent Publication Fund of Psycuer are 
earnestly solicited. 

In editorial support the management feels 
especially rich, referring with pride to the 
published list of associate editors. Without 
this support the task of issuing a fourth vol- 
ume of PsycHE would not have been accepted 
by the undersigned, who appreciate the difli- 


[Jan.—Feb. 1883. 


culties of performing their part well under 
the pressure of their other occupations, and 
with the limited resources at the command of 
the CLus. 

Psycue will be devoted, as heretofore. to 
the presentation of entomology in its higher 
and more philosophical aspects. It will 
leave to other magazines the bare descriptions 
of new species, and contests over priority and 
synonymy, as well as competition for the 
earliest announcement of news. As the offi- 
cial publication of the CAMBRIDGE ENTOMo- 
LOGICAL CLUB, it will contain the minutes of 
the meetings of the Crus, and serve as a 
medium of communication between the 
Although the CAMBRIDGE EnTo- 
MOLOGICAL CLuB is a_ society bearing a 
local name, its members are chosen without 
local limitation, and Psycue will endeavor to 
represent the interests of scientific entomol- 
ogy wherever pursued, and to advance, im- 
partially, the welfare of all societies having 
the same objects in view. Welcoming to its 
columns original articles of a character suited 
to its aims, i will seek to present to its 
readers such notices of, or extracts from, 
articles of like character, appearing in other 
publications, as will make it most valuable to 
the philosophic entomologist. Brief items, 
and condensed abstracts of the proceedings 
of scientific societies in all parts of the 
world, so far as they are related to general 
entomology, would be thankfully received by 
the editors. Official notices of the times and 
places of meetings of entomological societies 
will be inserted in our column devoted to that 
purpose, free of charge. 

The form of the BriBL1ioGRAPHICAL RECORD, 
being in accordance with the highest thought 
upon the subject in the world.* will remain 
unchanged; but the matter will be made more 
valuable than heretofore, by the exercise of 


members. 


a selection from among the works to be 
noticed by preference. While it has long 
been evident that the space which could be 
devoted to the Record in Psycue was insufti- 
cient for the publication of complete lists of

even those writings which it would be most 
appropriate to notice, the Editor of the Rec- 
ord has not withheld from publication such ar- 
ticles as came to hand, even though of minor 
importance. He will in the future preserve 
these in manuscript, indexed as well as may 
be, for reference, and publish the record only 
of the more important articles. Should 
means, from sources yet unknown, be af- 
forded for the presentation of acomplete work, 
none would appreciate the value of it more 
than he. In order to perfect this record, the 
editor respectfully requests that copies of pub- 
lications containing entomological articles 
may be sent by the authors or the publishers, 
or by friends of Psycur, to the Library of 
the CAMBRIDGE ENTrOMOLOGICAL CLUB, 
where they will be at the disposition of the 
subscribers to PsycHe, throughout North 
America, under the rules of the CLus.

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 
CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB. 


12 JAN. 1583.— The 89th meeting of the 
Club, the sixth annual meeting since the in- 
corporation of the Club, was held at 16 Quincy 
St., Cambridge, 12 Jan. 1883. 
(eight of whom were members) were pres- 
ent. 

The Secretary stated that Miss Cora H. 
Clarke had been transferred, 10 Jan. 1883, at 
her own request, from the list of associate 
members to the list of active members. 

The folltewing persons were elected to active 
membership: H: Savage, of Boston, Mass. ; 
Prof. Stephen Alfred Forbes, of Normal, III. ; 
W: Hague Harrington, of Ottawa, Canada; 
Prof. G: Macloskie, of Princeton, N. J.; Prof. 
Francis Huntington Snow, of Lawrence, 
Kansas. 

The annual reports of the Secretary, of 
the Treasurer and of the Librarian were read 


Nine persons 


and approved, the approval of the Treasur- 
ers report being subject to the action of the 
Auditing Committee. 

A motion was carried ‘‘ that the Club re- 


PSTCHL: 13 


sume the publication of PsycHEe, beginning 
with no. 105, of vol. 4 (the no. for Jan. 
1883), and that, with the exceptions herein- 
after stated, vol. 4 be published in similar 
style, typographically and otherwise, as vol. 3. 

“Exception 1. That the price of subscrip- 
tion be raised to two dollars per year, five 
dollars per volume of three years, and that 
subscribers can have, after payment of their 
subscriptions, if they so desire. in addition 
to their regular copy, a copy printed on one 
side of the paper, for pasting the slips of the 
Bibliographical Record. 

“Exception 2. That the editors to be elect- 
ed be recommended to make the Bibliograph- 
ical Record more current, if possible, and 
to omit publishing the record of notes and 
items of minor value which are contained in 
the popular and daily press.” 

Other changes proposed in PsyYCHE were. 
after some discussion, left to the discretion 
of the editors. 

The following officers were elected for the 
ensuing year: President, B: P. Mann; Sec- 
retary, G: Dimmock; Treasurer, S: Hen- 
shaw; Librarian, C. C. Eaton; members at 
large of the Executive Committee, R. Hay- 
ward and E: L. Mark. 

A motion was carried to elect a managing 
and an associate editor of PsycHr, these edi- 
tors to have full power to add to their num- 
ber. B: P. Mann was elected managing edi- 
tor, and G: Dimmock associate editor, for 
the ensuing year. 

The retiring President, Mr. S: H. Scudder. 
delivered his address, entitled ‘‘On mesozoic 
cockroaches.” The address was a general re- 
view of what is known of cockroaches of this 
age and a comparison of their forms with 
other fossil and living forms. The address 
was illustrated with many figures and with 
numerous specimens of fossils. 

Mr. W: Trelease communicated (by the 
Secretary) the following note: 

“At the Novembe1 meeting of the Club, in 
1881, I showed a specimen of ant architec- 
ture which was further described in PsycuE 
for Feb.1882. At the time this was written I 
had forgotten that Mr. Walsh has recorded 


V4 PSY 


(Pract. entom., v. 2, p. 40) cases constructed 
by My mica lineolata? Say over an aphis on 
Cornus stolontfera, and by a Formica over 
an aphis on Sa/éx. A case of the same kind 
ona species of alder is recorded by Mr. Wm. 
Couper as occurring near Toronto, in Canada. 
Lubbock (Scientific lectures, p- 71) states 
that ‘sometimes the ants even build covered 
ways up to and over the aphides, which, 
moreover, 
other insects.’ 

Mr. J: G. Jack stated that he had seen 
Vanessa antiopa, with unrolled proboscis, 
apparently sucking the sweet excretion about 
aphides, and had noticed similar actions in 
Limenitis dissipus and L. arthemis. 

Mr. A. F. Foerste communicated (by Mr. 
W: Trelease and the Secretary) a note con- 
cerning the habits of Alaus oculatus. ‘This 
note chiefly described the habit of feigning 
death and the reluctancy to spring in this 
species of elatertdae. Mr. G: Dimmock 
said he had noticed that A. ocu/atus disliked 
to spring.

Mr. S: H. Scudder said, in reply to a 
question, that all esferidae spin light co- 
coons, and that a few other butterflies allied 
to the hesferidae spin delicate cocoons. 
From these cocoon-spinning forms there is a 
gradual transition through forms which hang

different stages,

pend their pupae by the tip of the abdomen 
only. 

g Fes. 1883.—The goth meeting was held 
at 19 Brattle Square, Cambridge, g Feb. 1883. 
In the absence of the President Mr. S: H. 
Scudder was chosen chairman. Six persons 
(five of whom were members) were present. 

The Secretary read a letter from Mr. S: 
Henshaw, who regretted that he

he had been elected at the last meeting. [Mr.

[ Jan.—Feb. 1883, 


preceding the meeting of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, with 
other propositions in relation to the proposed 
meeting, was referred to the Executive Com- 
mittee with full power to act, but with the 
recommendation that the Committee should 
correspond with Mr. J. A. Lintner, who has 
already been asked to call a meeting of ento- 
mologists at that time and place, so that 
there might be no interference with the 
meeting to be called by him. 

Mr. Mann communicated (through the 
Secretary) some notes in regard to the ar- 
rangements necessary to be made for the 
issue of volume 4 of PsycHE, and further 
remarks were made by the Secretary upon 
the same subject. 

The following persons were elected to ac- 
tive membership: August F. Foerste,* of 
Dayton, Ohio; C: Diehl Zimmerman, of 
Buffalo, N. Y.; Capt. T. J. Mathews, of Gray- 
ville, Ill.; Theodor Pergande, of Washing- 
ton, D.C. 

Mr. G: Dimmock called attention to a 
paper by Dr. Hermann Henking, entitled. 
‘Beitriige zur Anatomie, Entwicklungs- 
geschichte and Biologie von Trombidium 
(Zeitschrift f. wissensch. 
Zool.. 1882, v. 37; p- 553-663, pl. 34-36), out- 
lining briefly the scope of the paper, and 
especially noticing a method of coloration 
by an alcoholic borax-carmine solution, as 
described by Dr. Henking. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder exhibited some plates 
from a paper on fossil neuroptera now in 
preparation, and a colored plate to illustrate 
the life-history of a species of /Ref/nfa, the 
pine-moth of Nantucket. 

Mr. Roland Thaxter called attention to a 
species of Monagria which he had studied. 
The larva bores in rushes from which it 
probably emerges as pupa. The question of 
how the egg survives the winter in the flood- 
ed and frozen marshes brought out some 
discussion. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder exhibited a large num- 
ber of figures of fossil coleoptera from Flor- 
issant, Col.

ENTOMOLOGICAL !TEMS. 


Dr. ANTON STUXBERG, of Stockholm, has 
been appointed director of the natural his- 
tory museum in G6teborg, Sweden, to fill the 
place of Prof. A. W. Malm, who died in 
March 1882. F 

Mr. Cuarres Fisu, of Brunswick. Me., 
has been obliged to give up the study of the 
pterophoridae and has transferred his col- 
lection of that family to Prof. C. H. Fernald, 
of Orono, Me. 2 

THE NECROLOGY for the preceding year, 
which has annually formed a part of the 
Bibliographical Record for each February 
numero of PsycHe, will be a part of the 
March numero this year. 


Mr. Henry G. Damner, 938 Broadway, 
St. Louis, Mo., is desirous of obtaining speci- 
lepidoptera, including European 
Catocalas from the eastern United 


mens of. 
species. 
States are particularly desired. 

*Pror. E. METSCHNIKOFF, the widely 
known author of papers on the embryology 
of insects, has left the University of Odessa, 
Russia, and Prof. W. Salensky of the Uni- 
versity of Kasan is called to fill his place. 

Mr. L. O. Howarp has found that pyre- 
thrum increases the heart-beat of the larvae 
of plusta brassicae from its normal rate of 
from 44 to 68 beats per minute to 150 to 164 
beats, after which it subsided to 140 beats 
and just before death to 130 beats per minute. 

AN INTERESTING series of papers by Rey. 
W. W. Fowler, under the title ‘‘Natural lo- 
calities of British coleoptera” is in progress 
in The Entomologtst.

sin is similar to wax but firmer and more

but if a softer one is desired a little vaselin 


is added.

PRESERVATION OF HONEY. Honey, accord- 
ing to A. Vogel, contains on an average one 
per cent of formic acid. Observing that crude 
honey keeps better than that which has been 
clarified, E. Mylius has tried the addition of 
formic acid, and found that it prevents fer- 
mentation without impairing the flavor of 
the honey.—Sc?. amer., 18 Nov. 1882, v. 47, 
p- 324. 

Tue U.S. Commissioner of Agriculture 
authorizes the editors of PSyCHE to announce 
that copies of his annual Reports for 1881- 
1882 will be sent to any entomologist who 
applies for them. Mr. Mann has made out a 
list of most of the principal entomologists, 
to whom the reports have been sent, and will 
be pleased to see that copies are sent to any 
others who may wish them. 

AT THE meeting of the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia, 30 May 1882, Pro- 
fessor Leidy called attention to the abun- 
dance of the ant Laeséus tuterjectus in the 
neighborhood of Philadelphia. It is 
tual with this ant to care for an Aphis and 
a Coccus, both of which it guards in flocks.

He described a particular nest under a flat 
stone, containing six distinct and closely 
crowded groups of the pale yellowish Aphis, 
and five of the red Coccus.—Amer. natz., Jan. 
1883, v- 17, p- 118. 

COLLECTING COLEOPTERA. ‘‘The large 
coarse tufts of grass that are to be found in 
almost every field are very productive if cut 
round with a sharp knife, lifted gently, and 
then inverted and shaken over paper. This 
isa very good method of collecting in winter, 
as it is almost certain to produce something, 
if all else has failed. Almost any beetle may 
be found in this way, as the tufts are favour- 
ite hybernating places; staphylinidae, how- 
ever, especially Sfen7, are the commonest.”—

1882, v. 15, Pp. 231-232.

found them white and yellow. I suspected 
they changed their color, and by experiment, 
I find that this isso. If I take a white one 
and put it on a sunflower, it will get quite 
yellow in from two to three days. I believe 
they capture almost anything, but they seem 
to be partial to the bees. I found one the 
other day with a wasp, the latter was not yet 
dead, but it was tightly held by the throat 
by the spider. The next day the wasp was 
found lying dead under the flower.—James 
Angus, in Amer. naturalist, Dec. 1882, v. 16, 
p- Toro. 


NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS. 


The concluding numeros of volume three 
of Psycue, for the publication of which the 
undersigned is responsible, will be issued 
as rapidly as possible. It was deemed, how- 
ever, inadvisable for the club to delay longer 
commencing volume four. As usual, the 
cause of the delay in the issue of PsycuEr 
has been the lack of good material for pub- 
lication. Articles of the greatest permanent 
value in entomology are hard to obtain for 
the reason that they are not hurried into 
print by their authors to gain priority.

(Continued from page 11.) 


SCALES OF HOPLIA. 


A few only of the scales from the 
upper side of this insect are colorless, 
and, as these seem to be undeveloped 
or immature, I tried no experiments 
upon them. . 

The scales of the under side of /. 
coerulea are purple, purplish red, red, 
bluish and colorless by transmitted light, 
and by reflected light they are silvery 
white with a tendency to metallic green 
in places. The scales of the tip of the 
abdomen, altho really dorsal in position, 
are covered with spines, are mostly 
reddish or purple by transmitted light, 
and metallic reflected 
light. 


are like those from the rest of the under 


are green by 


Some of the scales of the legs 
surface of the insect; others of them 
are lanceolate (fig. 3, c), and colorless 
or milk-white, but covered with longer 
spines or hairs than the more circular

SCALES OF POLYPHYLLA. 


The whitish spots upon the elytra of 
Polyphylla vartolosa ave produced by 
lanceolate scales, the opake whiteness 
of which is caused by the large amount 
of air contained in them. As they pre- 
sent no characters of special interest not 
to be found in scales of other coleoptera 
described in this paper I have not drawn 
them or further studied them.

SCALES OF VALGUS SQUAMIGER. 


Nearly every part of V. sgwamiger is 
covered with scales which are of two 
colors, an opake dark brown and a semi- 
opake white. The scales are somewhat 
rolled and are very brittle, so that when 
they are pressed beneath a cover-glass 
upon the microscope slide they usually 
split at the edges. The unbroken scales 
are nearly round, about 0.14 mm. long 
by 0.08 to 0.12 mm. wide, and until they 
are deprived of air but little structure is 
visible. When they are deprived of air 
they are seen to be covered with dense, 
rather long hairs, —to be in fact almost

scale that has been treated with alcohol 
to remove the air. The hairs, as will 
be seen by the figure, are arranged, 
somewhat roughly, in transverse or ob- 
lique lines; but what is more curious, 
the basal ends of these hairs seem to be 
connected, in each line, with one anoth- 
er, and finally each of these bands of 
hairs, which may contain from two to 
twenty hairs, seems to connect by its 
basal line with a branch going to the 
basal end, or stem, of the scale. These 
branches unite as they approach the 
basal end of the scale until they form 
one trunk. These ramifications are del- 
icate brown and are beautiful on a prep-

In fig. 4, which was made too small to, 
show them correctly, they are propor- 
tionally far too coarse, and are not tap- 
ered as regularly as they should be from 
base to tip. 

IT have not found this ramified structure 
in any scales except those of Valgus, 
and in them I have not studied it to any 
extent. It appears as if the cavity of 
the scale, once open and probably open- 
ing into the large hairs, had closed grad- 
ually, leaving channel-like folds between 
the hairs and from them to the stem of 
the scale. These channels are appar- 
ently entirely closed now, altho I made 
no sections’ of these scales to absolutely: 
prove this point. 


HAIRS OF PSILOPTERA. 


The under side of the abdomen and 
other parts of Ps. drzmmondé are clothed 
with brownish-yellow hairs, which are 
set upon a smooth, nearly black surface, 
and consequently the hairs appear of a 
light bronze color.

are easily seen to contain air by using

troduce them here only to illustrate this 
somewhat common form of appendage 
intermediate between scales and hairs. 


I have found no other squamiform ap- 


pendages on the limited number of 


buprestidae which I have examined. 


No description has been given, as far 
as I can discover, of scales in e/ater- 
tdae, altho the generic names Cha/co- 
lepis and Chalcolepidius, and the spe- 
cific names of Adelocera lepidoptera, 
Lacon leprosus, Meristhus lepidotus. 
Monocrepidius lepidus, Cryptohypnus 
sqguamifer, and others, would imply that 
the presence of scales had been either 
suspected or verified. That the scales 
of elater¢dae are interesting in form 
and structure can be seen by the follow- 
ing descriptions of scales of Chalcolep- 
Z7dtus, of A/aus and of an undetermined 
species of European e/aterzdae. 


SCALES OF CHALCOLEPIDIUS. 


Nearly the whole surface of C. radrd- 
pernis, except its elytra, is thickly coy- 
ered with scales, which give to the parts 
thus covered a peculiar metallic or 
bronzed aspect, with colors changing 
from blue to greenish or reddish. 


PSV CHE. 25 


The scales from all parts of this insect 
are very much alike, varying little in 
form (see fig. 6, a, 6, and c). They 
are all of ovate form, more or less elon- 
gate, with the larger end toward their 
shank or stem, which is nearly always 
broken off in removing them from the 
insect; they are very flat, scarcely con- 
vex above, but do not rest very tightly 
pressed upon the surface of the insect. 
Their length is from 0.09 to 0.15 mm., 
their width from 0.02 to 0.04 mm., and 
their thickness is about 0.0025 mm. 

These scales when removed and ex- 
amined under the microscope are uni- 
formly brown, except with very oblique- 
ly transmitted light, when they are 
sometimes purplish. If, however, they 
are put upon a black surface and illumi-

blue, red and green, the color depending 
upon the position of the surface of the 
scale with reference to the light. Put in 
direct sunlight, on a black surface, and 
the microscope focussed somewhat above 
them, the light is decomposed in fine lines 
of brilliant blue, green and red. as if 
series of solar spectra were drawn up 
near each other, thus indicating striation 
of the scale-surface. The scales have a 
very slight tendency to longitudinal fold- 
ing, but no striae, or really distinct

the scales are hollow ; whether the whole 
scale is hollow I have not determined. 
Treatment with water, alcohol, glyc- 
erin or turpentin does not seem to affect 
the scales of Chalcolepidius, which ap- 
pear to contain no air. They are not 


bleached by chlorin bleathing reagents. 


SCALES OF ALAUS. 


The two velvety black spots upon the 
dorsal surface of the thorax of A. ocuda- 
tus, to which this insect owes its specific 
name, are formed of scales, as are also 
all the white portions of the beetle, the 
ground color of the whole insect being 
a slightly shining black. The same re- 
marks apply to A. myops, the scales of 
which are like those of A. ocw/atus in 
every respect.

HOMINIVOROUS HABITS 
LOA Meal a, 


BY FRANCIS HUNTINGTON SNOW, 


I have from time to time had occa- 
sion to note the depredations of the 
screw-worm upon horses and cattle in 
this state, but until recently have not 
received positive evidence of its attacks 
upon human subjects in any locality so 
far north as Kansas. But early in Sep- 
tember, 1882, I received from Mr. S. 
D. Osborn, the postmaster at Varck, 
in Southeastern Kansas, specimens ‘‘of 
the worms which came from the nos- 
trils of Milton Carter.” These proved 
to be the larvae of Luczléa macellaria

maggots escaped from the nose of this 
patient, who finally recovered from the 
serious illness consequent upon their 
ravages. I also ascertained that Mr. 
Carter had long been afflicted with an 
offensive nasal catarrh, which made 
his nostrils an attractive place for the 
oviposition of the fly, and that he had 
fallen asleep in the woods in the day- 
time only a few days before the first 
appearance of the symptoms produced 
by the presence of the larvae.

much as sixteen ounces escaped, in- 
creasing in consistency until it was pure

offensive, his cough was more trouble- 
some and fever increased to such an 
extent as to produce slight delirium for 
twelve hours. What was thrown off 
was with much difficulty expectorated, 
and containing 
scopic particles of osseous matter, to- 
gether with flakes of plastic exudation. 
The os hyoides was evidently destroyed. 
The patient had spoken with difficulty 
for thirty-six hours and there was much 
trouble in swallowing. The soft palate 
had evidently given way and there was 
an entire inability to protrude the tongue 
or use it in speech.

totally destroyed as large as a dime 
[1S mm.]. They continued to drop 
from the mouth and nose, forced from 
the nostrils by the efforts of the patient, 
the following forty-eight hours, 
during which time 227 were counted 
and the estimated number exceeded 300. 
At this time the of the soft 
palate was destroyed. The patient 
lived four days after the last worm came 
away. 

‘“*T put five of the worms in dry earth 
and in fourteen days from the time they 
dropped from the nostril there hatched 
out three flies. 

‘‘Upon a very minute and careful ex- 
amination after death I was astonished 
to find that all the tissue covering the

see by throwing the head back and 
compressing the tongue, was wholly

Dr. Britton forwarded to me speci-

which I identified as Lzczléa macellarta

might be no possibility of error, I sub- 
mitted them to Dr. S. W. Williston, of 
New Haven, Conn., who corroborated

In order, however, 


this determination and furnished 
following notes concerning the species: 
**The specimens are evidently Lzcé/¢a 
(Campsomyia) macellartia Fab., a fly 
common from the Argentine Republic 
to Canada, and which from its varia- 
tions has probably received more spe- 
cific names (20!) than any other Amer- 
ican fly. It belongs to the M/wsc¢dae 
(true) and is not far from AZusca. Their 
hominivorous propensities have gained 
for them the synonyms of Lzczlia 
hominivorax Coquerel, and ZL. home- 
nivorus Cenil (S. America).” 

In the Peoria (Tll.) Medical Monthly 
for February, 1883, Dr. Joshua Rich- 
ardson, of Moravia, Iowa, has an article 
upon ‘* The screw-fly and its ravages,” 
from which I make the following ex- 
tracts: ‘* While travelling in Kansas 
in the latter part of last Augusta citizen 
of this place had the misfortune to

years ago in Texas, a screw-fly attacked

FALSE DATES. 


So far as our examination has gone, we 


have not learned that is was the custom of 
any scientific periodical to publish the actual 
date of its issue in a systematic manner, 
before such a practice was adopted in PsycHE. 
Whether PsyCHE was or was not a pioneer 
in this direction is of little importance com- 
pared with the importance of the principle 
thus illustrated. We are pleased to notice 
the adoption of this practice in one and 
another of our contemporaries. PsyCHE 
has practised it from the outset. 

With the concluding numero of its last 
finished volume (December 1882), the Cana- 
dian entomologist began to print, on the 
numero, the date of printing of each numero

to announce, numero, the date of

frequently occur, 
numero, is partly or even wholly printed, 
to delay its issue beyond the expected date, 
and the signatures cannot be, in that case, 
thrown away, or their date changed, with- 
out loss or trouble which will rarely be in- 
curred. No reliance. in most cases. therefore 
can be placed on such an announcement. 
As an announcement of date of printing 
and not of date of issue, it has no value in 


a question of priority. The announcement, 


LSE GLEE, bl 


as a statement of the date of 


issue, is positively false, in that it is made 


if intended 
in advance of issue; however strictly the 
fact may be made subsequently to coincide 
with the announcement. In case, however, 
the announcement is made after the event, 
it has a positive value. 

It is rarely the case that so excellent an 
opportunity of illustrating the evils of the 
practice of putting the date on the signature 
to which it refers is given, as in the state- 
ments of dates of issue which are appended 
to the last two volumes of the Proceedings 
of the Boston society of natural history. It 
is probable that a similar discrepancy be- 
tween the and the actual 
dates of issue occurs in the issue of the pro- 


pre-announced 


ceedings of many other societies, but in 
general there is no means of detecting the 
discrepancy. Even here it is not until two 
or three years after the issue of the first sig- 
natures before the true date of issue is made 
known. Meanwhile, what misunderstandings 
might arise, either controversially or pri- 
vately, from the erroneous impression con- 
veyed by the dates printed on the signatures ! 
It will be noticed, in the lists given below, 
especially from volume 20 of the Proceedings, 
in how many cases the announcement is 
false, and how great, in many cases, is the 
discrepancy.

We commend it to the attention of the 


editors, not only of the periodicals men- 
tioned, but also of others, whether it would 
not be well to adopt the principle illustrated 
in Psycue, of giving, at the earliest oppor- 
tunity, in a systematic manner, the dates of 
issue of parts already issued, and omitting 
dates of prospective issue.

ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF 
PHILADELPHIA. 


8 Auc. 1882. —The Rev. H: C. McCook 
described the raids of Formica sanguinea 
upon F. fusca —raids in which the black 
slaves assist their red masters. Reds and 
blacks shared the labor of raising the young. 
The nests of #. fusca, conspicuous in places 
where there were no red ants, were hard to 
find where ¢ne latter were common. An at- 
tempt to introduce the red ant into a city 
yard failed through theattacks of the com- 
mon pavement ant, Tetramorium caespitum. 

3 Ocr. 1882 —Dr. Skinner remarked that 
the organ of offence of the larva of Papilio, 
usually believed to be solid, is really hollow, 
rolled in and out upon itself. 

10 Ocr. 1882. — Rev. H: C. McCook pre- 
sented a paper upon the snares of orb- 
weaving spiders, and described four species 
of Eperra. 

31 Ocr. 1882. — Rev. H: C. McCook drew 
attention to the use of ants as insecticides by 
the Chinese, and stated his belief that as no 
American species lived on trees, the proba- 
bilities were against their usefulness for a 
similar purpose. 

7 Nov. 1882. —Rev. H: C. McCook pre- 
sented a paper on ‘‘Ants as beneficial insec- 
ticides” and advocated the importation of the 
ant used in China for the protection of 
orange trees. 

14 Noy. 1882.— Mr. Thomas Meehan stated 
that the nest of the wood pewee [ contopus 
virens | is held together by cobwebs. 

5 Dec. 1882.—Dr. Horn remarked upon 
the singular distribution of the apterous 
water-beetle AmPhrzoa, one species of which 
inhabits California, a second the district 
northward of that state as far as Vancouver's 
island, while a third has been found high up 
in the mountains of Thibet. 

23. Jan. 1883.— Dr. Skinner stated that 
Argynnts cybele, instead of carefully deposi- 
ting its eggs, as is usual with butterflies, 
dropped them from a distance upon the her- 
bage.—Complied trom Amer. nat., April 1883,

Pror. J. T. REINHARDT, who died 23 Oct. 
1882, is succeeded, in his place as inspector 
of the zoological museum in Copenhagen, 
by Dr. Christian Liitken. 


THE FRENCH association for the advance-

years. 


Count H. zu So_ms-Lausacu has lately 
published a pamphlet on the origin, domes-

EMBRYOLOGY OF THE SILK-WORM. — This 
has been studied by S. Salvatico, who finds 
that the amnion appears as a membrane with 
large nucleated cells like those of the serous 
membrane, but without pigment. The mal- 
pighian vessels originate in the ectoderm. 
He did not note the early appearance of the 
rudiments of the genital glands, which wag 
observed by Balbiani in TZ¢xea crrnella.— 
Amer. nat., April 1883, v- 17, p- 444. 

ProrF. XAverR LANDERER writes, in the 
Deutsch-Amerthkanische  Apotheker-Zeitung 
for 1 March 1883, that ‘‘the largest and heay- 
iest grasshoppers are sought out in Arabia, 
Egypt, etc. The wings. feet, heads, etc. are 
torn off and the remaining fleshy part put in 
vinegar and used as pickles. In Abyssinia I 
had such sour grasshoppers prepared with 
aromatic herbs, set before me, and they tast- 
ed finely and would be eaten with appetite 
by all who did not know what they really 
had before them.” 


Pror. F. W. MAEKLIN died January Sth of 
this year at Helsingfors, Finland, at the age 
of 61 years. He was known to American 
coleopterists by his papers on Strongylium 
and Statira, and by his descriptions of a 
large number of coleoptera (mostly Staphy- 
linidae) extreme north-western 
portions of our country. One of his earlier 
and little known papers, a dissertation on re- 
presentative (vikarierande) forms among 
northern coleoptera (published in the Swedish 
language, Helsingfors, 1855) is quite interest- 
ing to American coleopterists, and was trans- 
lated into German by F. von Sacken in the 
Stettiner Entomologische Zeitung for 1857.— 
Amer. naturalist, April 1883, v. 17, p- 424.

care that the tar retains all the efficacious

ing of the tar over a moderate coke or coal 
fire to 20°-40° C. A proper quantity of lime 
or finely powdered gypsum is mixed with 
it. A pulverisable mass is now obtained, 
which is rubbed thfough a sieve, and after 
completely cooling, the powder is mixed 
with ammonic sulphate, ferrous sulphate, 
bits of glass, and sodic sulphate, all in pul-

THE SCALES OF COLEOPTERA. 


BY GEORGE DIMMOCK, 


(Continued Srom page 


The brown scales are lustreless and 


without cross-bands, while the white 
scales, as long as they are filled with 
air, are silvery. This fact and other 
reasons lead me to believe that the cross- 
bands are partial separations of the 
lower lamina of the scale, and are the 
cause of the silvery lustre of the white 
scales. I reserve, however, further dis- 
cussion of the production of silvery sur- 
faces for the last portion of this paper. 
To get at the finer structure of these 
scales transverse sections of some of the

ELATERIDAE, SPECIES UNDETERMINED.

are, however, similar in structure to the

have in addition a prolongation of the

A species of Péézus, probably P. ra-

in a dry-goods store in Leipzig, Ger- 
many, furnishes 
scales. This coleopteron is clothed with 
brown hairs, one of which is figured 
(fig. 9, c) and among these hairs are 
scales (fig. 9, @ and 6). The relative 
size of. the hairs and scales of this spe- 
cies of P¢#énus may be seen from fig. 9, 
where both are drawn enlarged too di- 
ameters. ‘These scales have from two 
to seven long apical points, are attached 
by a little stem at the base, and are 0.06 
to 0.09 mm. in length by 0.01 to 0.03 
mm. wide. Their color is light brown, 
which is apparently produced, for the 
most part, by somewhat irregular longi- 
tudinal stripes or thickenings upon the 
inner surface of the scales. These scales 


are filled with air.

SCALES OF CLYTUS ROBINIAE. 


Nearly all the yellow stripes upon C. 
robintae owe their entire coloration to 
the scales with which they are covered. 
This can be seen best by scraping all the 
scales from the insect, after which, with 
the exception of the legs and a few yel-

Scale of Clytus robiniae. 


The black or brown scales from the 
upper surface of the thorax or from the 
elytra of C. robénéue resemble, at first 
glance, those of A/aus oculatus, but 
upon closer examination they prove to 
be quite different. Their form is approxi- 
mately an elongated parallelogram (see 
fig. 10), with the shank or point of at- 
tachment at one of the acute angles. 
The striae originate at and near the 
shank and terminate along the opposite 
end of the scale, thus diflering entirely, 
in this respect, from the scales of A/aus. 

The scales of C. robéniae are 0.15 to 
o.t8 mm. long by about 0.02 mm. wide. 
Under the microscope they are dark 
brown or light yellow, according to 
whether they are from the black or yel- 


low parts of the insect. Both the yellow

and the brown scales have the same form 
and structure, and both contain air, as 
can be readily seen by the action of water 
upon them. Neither the brown nor the 
yellow scales can be bleached by chlorin. 

Of the numerous scales of curcalion- 
dae, the family of coleoptera in which 
the posse 


sion of scales may be said to 
be almost a rule, I have chosen for es- 
pecial study the

scales, glistening by reflected light with 
the brightest colors, and these colors are 
heightened by the shining black back- 
ground which the surface of the insect 
affords. Hairs and scales cover its legs, 
and the hairs, as will be seen later, are 
of the same nature as are the scales. 
The form of these appendages is 
extremely variable. Their greatest 
width is about 0.06 mm., and from this 


ESC LLL 45 


width gradations may be found down 
to hairs of a diameter of less than 0.01 
mm. The length of such as are typi- 
cally scales (fig. 11, @, 6 and c) is 0.15 
too.18 mm. The hairs attain a length 
of 1.3 mm. 

Both hairs and scales are colored in 
the same way and with the same colors, 
chiefly red, blue and yellow, by trans- 
mitted light, and green and purple by 
reflected light. Whatever the color by 
reflected light, its complementary color

the margin of a compartment different 
from the color of the middle of the com- 
partment, as in the upper part of fig. 11, 
6. The extreme margin of the scales 
is always transparent and colorless, and 
sometimes, as if by a flaw, a little 
transparent spot extends into the colored 
portion of the scale, as near the base of 
fig. 11, c. At all points along the mar- 
gin where different compartments meet 
the marginal transparent portion seems 
to extend inward, and with higher mag- 
nifying powers a very thin, transparent 
partition can be seen extending between 
the compartments. This partition is 
clearly and perhaps too strongly repre- 
sented on fig. 11, @ ande. If a part 
of a scale, especially near its base, is 
broken, two edges can be readily seen, 
showing the scale to be hollow, and the 
color sometimes fails near the broken

rin or sulphuric anhydrid (SO,) fails 
to bleach the scales; acids and alkalies 
do not change their colors. Uninjured 
scales are not penetrated by liquids and 
remain colored inthem. The coloration 
is surely due, then, to physical causes, 
that is to some form of interference of 
light. 

The hairs are colored similarly to the 
scales, although the finer hairs appear 
to the naked eye, or to a simple lens, 
as silvery white, even when seen ona 
black surface. In the hairs the colors 
often alternate in the same general man- 
ner as they do in the scales, but, as is 
usual in the scales, yellow, or yellowish- 
red, is generally nearest the basal portion 
of the hair. The external transparent 
sheath or wall of the hairs, correspond- 
ing. as seen under the microscope, to 
the transparent margin of the scales, 
varies much in thickness ; in some cases 
the coloration fills nearly the whole 
hair, in other cases the channel through 
the hair is very small and consequently 
the color line very narrow in the hair. 
When treated with water or other liquids 
broken hairs are rendered transparent 
in the same manner as injured scales. 

When filled with water the hairs and 
scales still show, sometimes quite dis- 
tinctly, the partitions between their 
different compartments. In rare cases 
liquids fail to pass a partition, leaving 
one part of a scale or hair colored after 
another part has been rendered trans- 
parent. Thus it is evident that, how- 
ever thin the partitions may be, they 
are water-tight when uninjured; they 
are, nevertheless, apparently usually 
broken through, the scales themselves

being so brittle that few can be removed 
without breaking. |My experiments 
were all made with scales from a speci- 
men dried at least over ten years; pos- 
sibly a fresh specimen would have less 
brittle scales. 

Further microscopic examination of 
narrow scales and hairs reveals a longi- 
tudinal striation, the striae of which are 
from 0.0015 to 0.0020 mm. (or even 
further) apart. This striation, which 
for greater distinctness I will call the 
‘coarser striation,” is present on hairs, 
less marked on elongated scales, and 
not generally observable on broad scales 
(such as represented in fig. 11, 6). This 
coarse striation is visible after the color 
has been removed from the scales and 
hairs by reagents. It is easily seen to 
be external on the cylindrical hairs, 
extending beyond the colored portion of 
the hairs. 

Still higher magnifying power brings to 
view a second striation, which [ will call 
the ‘‘finer striation.” This striation was 
much more difficult to see than the coarser 
striation, the striae being very delicate 
and only 0.0008 to 0.0009 mm. apart. 
Unlike the coarser striation, the finer 
striation is more evident on broad scales 
and least evident or not discernible, at 
least with the objectives at my com- 
mand, on narrow scales and on hairs. 
The finer striation is further unlike the 
coarser striation in following no definite 
direction on the scale, sometimes being 
in one direction in one portion of a scale 
and in another direction in another part 
of the same scale. In any single com- 
partment of a scale the direction of the 


finer striation is approximately the same,

sometimes a little curved, resembling, 
as seen under the microscope, the fur- 
rows of the finger-tips. In adjacent 
compartments of a scale the finer striae 
are sometimes at right angles to each 
other, though oftener in the same direc- 
tion. I have attempted to represent, 
on fig. 11, @ and e, the finer striation 
upon two scales, but the striae, although 
proportionately about the right dis-

ON AN EGG-PARASITE OF THE CURRANT SAW-FLY (NEMATUS 
VENTRICOSUS). 


BY JOSEPH ALBERT LINTNER, ALBANY, N. Y. 


{Read before the American 


Association for the Advancement of Science, at its Montreal 


meeting, 29 August 1882. ] 


Dr. Asa Fitch, in his 12th Annual 
report on the insects of New York for 
1867 (Trans. N. Y. state 
soc. for 1867, 1868, v. 27), p. 
made the following reference 


the 
agric. 
SEE ep 
to this insect: 

“As none of the foreign accounts 
which we have seen allude to any para- 
sitic enemy of this currant saw-fly, it 


seemed quite improbable that it w ‘ould 
in this country meet with any such 


year 


enemy, to lighten from us the task of 


combatting it and diminishing its devas- 
tations. But our valued friend J. é 

Lintner, of Schoharie, greets us with 
the glad tidings that he Thee discovered 
we have such a foe to this formid- 
able scourge. An egg parasite of this 
saw-fly iuhabits our sta ite, an exceedingly 
minute hymenopterous insect, w hich 
inserts its eggs into those of the saw-fly, 
that its young may subsist upon and con- 
sume the contents of those eggs. This 
diminutive little fly has prov: tbly existed 
hitherto upon the eggs of some one of 
our American saw- Alies similar in size 
to those of the currant saw-fly; and it 
has now discovered that the eggs of this 
newly arrived foreigner are equally well 
adapted to its wants. And so multi- 
plied has this little friend of the gar- 
dener become, that in Utica Mr. Lintner 
finds that among fifty eggs of a saw-fly 
upon a currant leaf, there will not be 
more than four or five that will hatch

nied by the little maggot, the young of 
this parasite. At Scnahane! also, where 
the saw-fly has arrived more recently 
than at Utica, he finds this parasite 
is now beginning to appear. Every- 
where this little creature is no doubt 
following upon the tracks of the saw- 
fly, and fwithin a very few years after 
the one arrives in any place the other 
will be there also, and will speedily 
become so multiplied as to quell and 
extinguish it. This is a most impor- 
tant discovery, and renders it quite 
probable that in this country this cur- 
rant worm can never be but a tempo- 
rary evil. Whenever circumstances 
favor it and enable it to multiply and 
become numerous in any section of our 
country, this little enemy, its mortal foe, 
will speedily be there to subdue and 
stamp it down. Thus nicely are the 
works of nature balanced, and no crea- 
ture is permitted to usurp a place in her 
domain which does not belong to it.”

tinued to search for them, I have been 
unable to obtain the species. 

Its rediscovery by me the present year, 
and the determination of the species, 
lend additional interest to the notes 
upon it that I made at its first observa- 
tion, at Utica, N. Y., in June 1866, 
and I therefore transcribe them from 
my note-book :— 

I had collected a number of currant 
leaves upon which the currant saw-fly 
had deposited eggs, and was counting 
the eggs upon each to obtain the average 
number per leaf, when I noticed an 
occasional brown egg among them, ap- 
pearing somewhat abnormal in shape. 
On placing them under a lens a resem- 
blance to a pupal form was detected. 
I at once suspected the presence of the 
parasite for which we had been hoping. 
Although there seemed to be but the 
merest chance of discovering at large 
an insect so minute as this must neces- 
sarily be, I instituted a careful search 
of the currant bushes in the garden, and 
in a short time had the great gratification 
of discovering a minute speck moving 
among the eggs, which under my lens 
revealed a form which left scarce room 
for doubt of its parasitic character. 
During the day I detected several more 
of the kind upon the leaves containing 
egg-deposits, affording strong evidence 
of their relationship. A few days there- 
after (perhaps a week), in a small phial 
in which I had placed some eggs that 
I suspected of having been parasitized, 
I had the delight of seeing several of 
the familiar forms of my currant-leaf 
acquaintances, and the ruptured pupa

cases from which they had evidently 
escaped. 

The following year (1867) there was 
a marked diminution in the number of 
currant-worms observed, and a corres- 
ponding increase in parasitized eggs. 
Many of the leaves had not been visited 
by the parasite, but of those that gave 
evidence of such visit, the work of de- 
struction was almost complete, for of 
several leaves bearing each from thirty to 
forty eggs, all but five or six were trans- 


formed into parasitic pupae. 


In June 1868, I was able to make, at 
Schoharie, N. Y., the following obser- 
the 


parasite within the eggs of the currant 


vations upon the oviposition of 
saw-fly :— 


In a small phial in which had been 
placed some parasitized eggs of the saw- 
fly, a male and female parasite had 
emerged. That I might observe their 
actions I introduced a piece of currant 
leaf having upon it some eggs which 
I had just seen deposited. No evidence 
was given that the female was aware 
of the presence of the eggs, but after 
several minutes traveling around the 
glass, she moved upon the leaf, and in 
passing over and beneath it, seemed

and constantly palpating them with her 
antennae. Then, satisfied with her ex- 
amination, she attached herself to one 
of the eggs, appressed the tip of her

position motionless for the space of two- 
and-a-half minutes, during, which time 
an egg, doubtless, was inserted, although 
the pocket lens with which the observa- 
tion was made did not disclose the fact. 
The motion of her antennae then recom- 
menced, and I expected to see the 
operation just witnessed repeated upon 
another egg; but, to my surprise, she 
merely changed position—again applied 
the tip of her abdomen to a different 
part of the same egg, and remained 
at rest for about the same space of time 
as before. Three times I witnessed this 
performance, and it is therefore pro- 
bable that three parasitic eggs were 
placed within the one of the currant: 
fly. Unfortunately an interruption pre- 
vented me from noticing if the remain- 
ing currant-fly eggs were similarly 
parasitized, and the number of eggs in- 
troduced in each; and my 
regret, the eggs were accidentally de- 
stroyed before my observations could be 
upon their 
parasitic pupae. The pupa cases are 
dark brown, disclosing some of the

made transmutation into 


outlines of the contained pupae, some- 
what flattened, broader than the original 
egg, but of about its length. The in- 
sect is apparently one of the chalcédidae, 
having a broad head, long and elbowed 
antennae, ovoid anterior wings, nearly 
veinless, beautifully deli- 
cately fringed and haired; the posterior 
wings are almost linear ; the abdomen is 


iridescent, 


short, not reaching the tips of the wings.

a dozen individuals. Its progress seems 
to be from west to east, corresponding 


with that of the currant-worm. 


The rediscovery of the parasite the 
present year (1882) was made in my 
garden at Albany, upon a solitary cur- 
rant bush growing there. The parasitized 
eggs were enclosed in a bottle, and ina

tion of an insect which had already 
shown its capability for usefulness, I 
visited another garden in the city to 
obtain eggs of the currant-fly for para- 
sitization by my confined individuals. 
To my surprise, the parasite was here 
found in strong force, for in the ex- 
amination of a long row of currant 
bushes containing many eggs, I could 
not find a single egg-bearing leaf which 
had not been visited, and the destruc- 
tion of the eggs ensured. A large num-

these for study and for propagation, the 
remainder were made up in small par- 
cels of about a half-dozen each, and 
mailed to entomological friends in vari- 
ous parts of the United States and 
Canada, with the request that they be 
pinned upon currant-bushes among the 
leaves where the currant-fly eggs were 
to be found. The introduction of para- 
sites in this manner into localities where 
they had not previously occurred, has 
been shown to be practicable; and in 
consideration of the great importance of 
parasitic aid in the destruction of our

insect pests, I sincerely hope that my 
efforts to distribute this very efficient 
parasite may prove, from observations 
to be made hereafter, to have been suc- 
cessful. 

Examples of the insect were sent by 
me to Mr. L. O. Howard, of the De- 
partment of agriculture at Washington, 
a gentleman who has made _ special 
study of the family to which it pertains, 
viz., the chalctdidae. He informs me 
that there is no doubt of its being the 
species described and named by Dr. 
C. V. Riley in 1879 (Can. entom., 
Sept. 1879 v. 11, p. 161-162) as Trécho- 
gramma pretiosa, examples of which 
had been reared, at Washington, from 
eggs of the cotton-worm moth, &lt;Adef/a 
argtllacea Hiibn., collected in Alabama. 
The description is reproduced, with 
additional information, in Prof. J. H. 
Comstock’s Report upon cotton insects 
(Washington, 1879), p. 193. It has 
since been extensively reared from eggs 
of the same moth collected in Florida, 
by Mr. H. G. Hubbard. It has also 
been bred at the U. S. Department of 
agriculture from eggs of an unknown 
noctuid moth occurring on orange trees, 
and from A/eyrodes. 

Dr. Riley, from 
features, thought that it might be nec- 
essary to establish a new genus for this 
species and one or two closely allied 
ones, but Mr. Howard finds it to be a 
true Zr¢chogramma, as at first referred.

of the egg-parasite of the currant-fly, 
it may be of interest to offer the follow-

single currant leaf within one hour. In 
the act of ovipositing, it curved the tip 
of its abdomen downward and forward, 
directing its ovipositor toward its head, 
in which position the end of the egg is 
seen to protrude and attach itself to the

Moving backward a very little, another

produced their larvae on June 14th.

By a mere chance I see that a state-

ing the tarsal structure of fsoctédae 
confirms, in a most satisfactory manner, 
that made by Prof. Westwood in 1857

Being occupied with the atropzna, I 
was astonished to find that the young 
forms have only two-jointed tarsi (in- 
stead of three-jointed, as is found in 
the imago), but the last joint, internally, 
in the middle, shows a more or less 
visible division, where the 3rd _ joint 
(the median) will be formed, and just 
below it are one or two small bristles. I 
have observed this in A[¢ropos]| d¢vin- 
atoréa (reared by myself), szcctnica, 
and oleagina, and also in HZyperetes 
tessellatus. So long as the young have 
only two-jointed tarsi, the antennae have 


also less joints. Thus, in A. d¢vinato-

rza the latter have only 12 instead of 
‘the 15 of the imago; in //yperetes the 
proportions are 13 to 23. But, although 
the third (middle) joint of the tarsi is 
produced by a division of the apical, 
it is just the contrary with the antennae: 
In these the two thick basal joints, and 
the apical joint are not divided; but in

flyperetes is in the latter case, 
all the 10 intermediate joints being divi- 
ded in the imago, as I can show from 
preparations. It is a remarkable fact 
that the mysterious Zyferetes shows, in 
its earlier stages, precisely the normal 
number (13) of joints for the psoc¢dae. 
Iam not prepared to give an opinion 
as to this genus. Other genera, such 
as Caecrlius, commonly considered to

REARING LEPIDOPTERA. 


It will be gratifying to those entomol- 
ogists who recognise the great importance 
of the knowledge of the early stages of insect 
life, to learn of the attention that is being 
given to this department of study by Mr. S. 
L. Elliot, of New York City. For the last 
few years, this gentleman has been indefati- 
gable in his lepidopterological studies, and 
especially in larval collections and breeding 
from the egg. Fortunate in the ability to 
devote his entire time to the work, and actu- 
ated by an enthusiasm that scarcely recog- 
nises the need of any respite from the ab- 
sorbing ‘‘labor of love” — very valuable.and 
important results have already followed his 
labors. The life-histories of a number of 
rare species have been worked out. New 
species have been discovered, and so-called 
species shown to be simple varieties. Im- 
mense numbers of larvae have been collected 
and reared upon their food-plants, descrip- 
tions of the new forms, with the aid of Mr. 
Henry Edwards, have been taken, and thou- 
sands of perfect insects have been obtained 
for the cabinets of those who prize perfect 
forms. His success in carrying lepidoptera

through their winter pupation, by means of 
a method and appliances devised by himself, 
has never, we believe, before been equalled. 
Several thousands of pupae have been carried 
through the past winter with scarcely any 
loss except that unavoidably resulting from 
parasitic attack. We know of no one else in 
the United States, who is rearing the larvee 
of lepidoptera so successfully and on so large 
a scale.

BOOK NOTICES. 

It is understood that Mr. Wm. Saunders, 
of London, Ontario, has in preparation and 
has nearly completed a volume upon ‘‘The 
Insects of our Fruits and Fruit-trees.” The 
great need of the information that this vol- 
ume will present, has long been felt, and it 
is very gratifying to know that the want is 
soon to be supplied. The larger portion of it 
is already in type. Much labor has been be- 
stowed upon its preparation to render it as 
complete as possible and prefectly reliable. 
It will make a volume, as we learn from the 
author, of nearly 450 pages. Almost every 
species noticed will be illustrated, requiring 
for the purpose over 4oo figures. It will be 
issued by the well known publishing-house 
of Lippincott &amp; Co., of Philadelphia, in their 
best style, and will be offered to the public at 
a price (probably $3) that will bring it with- 
in the reach of all who need it. From the 
distinguished ability of the author, his famil- 
iarity with fruit-culture, and the special efforts 
made by him to render the volume all that it 
should be, we are confident that it will prove 
to be a standard work upon the subject of 
which it treats, and that it cannot fail of com- 
manding an extensive sale. FAaviled&amp;e

ENTOMOLOGICAL ‘iTEMS. 


Pror. WiLHeLM Peters, director of the 
zoological museum of the university of Berlin) 
died 20 April 1883. He was born 22 April 1815; 
at Koldenbuttel, Kreis Eiderstet, Germany. 


Mr. A. W. P. CRAMER notes in the Budlle- 
tin of the Brooklyn Entomological Society 
for April 1883, the capture of two specimens 
of Catocala untyuga on shipboard, in mid- 
ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. 


IN THE seventeenth annual course of lec- 
tures to mechanics at the Sheffield scientific 
school, New Haven, Conn., lately completed, 
Dr. E. H. Jenkins delivered a lecture on the 
agency of insects in the 
flowers. 

THe ENTOMOLOGICAL Society of France, 
in its last meeting in February, gave the 
Dollfus prize to M. Bedel, author of the 
“Faune der coléopteres du bassin de la 
Seine,” for the part of his work devoted to 
the rhyncophora which appeared in the an- 
nales of the society for 1882. 


WE ARE glad to see that the Ottawa field 
naturalists’ club maintains such activity. 
Excursions, the publication of its transac- 
tions, soirees, and prizes for collections and 
original work, stimulate the members to in- 
dustry. Mr. W. H. Harrington is the secre- 
tary, and Messrs. Harrington, J. Fletcher and 
J. B. Tyrrell are leaders in entomology. 


THe WorcEsTER (Mass.) Lyceum and 
natural history association held its annual 
meeting 12 May. 1883. From a two and one- 
half column review of the reports of its 
different officers, as given in the Worcester 
daily spy of 14 May, we learn that Mr. F. G. 
Sanborn gave, during the past vear, a course 
of S lessons on entomology to 10 students. 
We are glad to see the progress made by the 
association in popular instruction in natural 
science and we know from personal experi- 
ence the fitness of Mr. Sanborn, who is 
curator of the association’s museum, for the 
work of exciting interest among voung peo- 
ple in the study of natural history.

THROUGH LACK of familiarity with the 
literature of the subject, Mr. R. H. Stretch 
has redescribed (Papilio, Feb. [March] 1883, 


v. 3, p- 41-42), the anal appendages of the 


male of SLeucarctia acraea. These were 
originally described by H. K. Morrison 
(Psyche, Oct. 1874, v. I, p. 21-22), who also 


found similar organs in Danazs archippus, 
Agrotis plecta, and Euplexta lucipara. This 
organ in Danazs is briefly described in E. 
Burgess’ ‘** Contributions to the anatomy of 
the milk-weed butterfly, Danazs archippus” 
(Boston, 1880), without mention of its 
earlier discoverer. Similar organs have been 
described and figured by C. G. Siewers 
(Canadian entomologist, March 1879, v. 11, 
p. 47-48) who found them in males of Cadld7_ 
morpha interruptomarginata, and concluded 
that they aided the insect in flight. Siewer’s 
article is noticed in the Entomologist’s 


monthly magazine, June 1879, v. 16, p. 19.

CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 


BY GEORGE DIMMOCK, 
(Continued from page 47.) 
GENERAL SUMMARY. 


After the 
some forms of scales among coleoptera, 


preceding descriptions of 


I wish to consider the subject more 
generally. First to be considered is the 
question, in what families of coleoptera 
have scales been found. Fischer men- 
tioned scales as occurring in teredyles, 
clavicornes, lamellicornes and curcu- 
liontdes,—or to use the modern equiv- 
alents for the families in which he found 
scale-bearing species,— in the cler¢dae, 
ptinidae, byrrhidae, 
scarabaetdae and curculionidae. To 
this list I would add with certainty the 
elateridae, basing this addition on the 


Chalcolepidius and Alaus 
described in this paper. According to 


dermestidae, 


scales of 


my views of what constitutes a scale I 
would add further the cerambycidae, 
and with some doubt the dafrestidae. 


The 
scribed in this paper, it seems to me, 


scales of Clytus robiniae de- 
can scarcely be called hairs, altho to 
the naked eye or to a low-power lens 
they appear like hairs. 
much flattened and the striae end in the 
manner in which they do in scales. 


They are too 


The question whether the sword-shaped 
appendages of Ps’loptera drummondi 


are really scales or hairs is less easily 
settled but I should be inclined, from 
the arrangement of their striae, to term 
them scales. The form of scale from 
Alaus is readily seen, by the figure of 
its transverse section (fig. 7, @), to be 
too flat to be termed a hair, and this or 
similar forms are not uncommon among 
coleoptera. 

The question of the morphological 
identity of scales and hairs of insects has 
been long since settled, so that the ques- 
tion of whether an appendage is a scale 
or hair has little importance. The ex- 
tremely minute spines or hairs upon 
the wings of diptera, hymenoptera and 
other insects are simply another form of 
scales. It is only in insects where cer- 
tain kinds of brilliant coloration have 
been developed that one finds scales. 
This leads to a consideration of how 
hairs and scales of insects affect color- 
ation. They may simply cover a sur- 
face of the same color as their own; in 
such cases hairs may, according to the 
angle in which they stand, their abund- 
ance or their length, give rise to ap- 
pearances which we designate as pubes- 
cent, velvety, pilose, sericeous, etc. ; 
scales under similar circumstances may 
give rise to similar appearances, but are 


64 PS) CLL 


most often imbricated and usually cause 
more lustre than hairs. Hairs or scales 
may be of a different color from the 
surface on which they are placed. If 
they are numerous and opake they may 
entirely conceal the surface on which 
they are inserted, as the white hairs 
hide the bronze surface of the sides of 
the thorax in Cve¢nrdela dorsalis, and 
as the white scales of A/auws oculatus 
hide the black surface beneath the rings 
on the thorax ; or they may only partly 
conceal the surface of the insect, giving 
rise to coarser and finer mixtures and 
shades of color. Opake scales. or 
hairs, of more than one color, may cause 
figuration, whether they imbricate as on 
the wings of lepidoptera, or are separ- 
ated as on Anthrenus scrophulartae. 
The possibilities of varying effects 
of color are many with opake scales 
and hairs, but with transparent ones, 
especially if they are colored, the effects 
of color can be multiplied still further. 
With

hairs the effects are not so re- 
The scale, by 
its form, increases the number of layers 
of the surface of an insect which are 
available for colorational purposes. 
Where the surface of an elytron had 
previously a cuticular and hypodermal 
layer, by the addition of a scale of the 
simplest type there is an addition of 
two cuticular and, theoretically at least. 
two hypodermal or sub-cuticular layers ; 
in all six layers, without counting over- 
lappings of imbricated scales. Some 
of these surfaces may have pigments, 
striae, hairs and other appliances to 
produce colors, and other surfaces may

have other striae and contrivances to 
act on the colors produced. The nu- 
merous modifications need not be enu- 
merated here. I have alluded to special 
effects of coloration in describing the 
scaies of different insects and_ shall 
again refer to some of them when dis- 
cussing the modes by which the scales 
themselves are colored. I may add here 
that the general effect of transparent 
scales is to produce metallic coloration. 

The kinds of coloration in coleoptera 
have been neatly tabulated by Fischer, 
according to the families of these insects. 
I translate his table, making in it, a few 
alterations based upon my own obser-

color and presence of scales and hairs 
affect the 
which they are attached is the not less

properly speaking, a few words are 
appropriate on the causes which pro- 
duce silvery and milk-white appearan- 
ces in scales and on insects. Leydig 
was the first, in 4855, to call attention 
to the presence of air between or be- 
neath their chitin layers as a cause for 
certain silvery spots and scales on in- 
sects. He speaks of air in the finer 
pore-canals of /xodes testudinis. giv-

their silvery whiteness to air within

contain air on spiders of the genera 
Evpeira and Theridium. 
ther, when considering the insects, Ley- 
dig writes that it is not difficult to see 


that the silvery under surface of //y- 


Then _ fur- 


drometra paludum is due to the pore- 
canals being filled with air. He goes 
on to say ‘In a similar way the wings 
of Notonecta glauca seem to enclose 
air, and I suspect also that the white 
color of the hairy powder of many 
aphidae and cocctdae is brought about 
by like causes.” Further on he writes, 
“If one regards the color of scales it 
can inhere as diffuse material in the 
substance of the scale itself, or it ap- 
molecular 
pigment, which the 


cavities of the scales, or finally the 


pears under the form of 


is deposited in 


cavities are filled with air which gives a 
snow-white appearance to the scale.” 
Again Leydig writes that when Fischer 
says, in speaking of *‘granulation-scales” 
(i. e., such scales as those of H/op/ia 
trifasctata), ‘that the ‘upper or gran- 
ulation layer’ dissolved visibly in water, 
but quickly in alcohol or ether, and then 
only the ‘striate basal layer’ remained, 
the words show that he has certainly 
seen but incorrectly explained that 
change which the scale undergoes upon 
the loss of air, in so far as he assumed 
a ‘granulation layer’ which dissolves in 
water !” 

Leydig accounted for silvery glisten- 
ing scales and surfaces, and for milk- 
white coloration among insects, but he

silvery appearance from the aveount of

did not do, and the mirror will again 
appear. Both silvery and milk-white

produce the silvery color in the scales 
of lepidoptera. The striae themselves 
are very fine, but whether they are the 
causes of color is hard to determine 


without more accurate instruments of 
measurement than I have at my com- 
mand. &lt;As near as I could determine 
they are 0.0008 to 0.0009 mm. apart. 
The wave length of a ray of light from 
Frauenhofer’s A line of the spectrum is, 
according to Willigen, .00076092 mm., 
and the wave length at the //, line is, 
according to the same _ authority, 
0.00039713 mm.; the difference being 
0.00036379 mm., or the difference gf 
wave length between violet and red 
light. To determine the f/ace in the 
spectrum to which the striae of these 
scales correspond would require, of 
course, much finer measurements. 

The kinds of coloration of 


thus far described are what Hagen has 


scales 


termed ‘‘optical colors.” 
The kind of coloration is 
what Hagen terms ‘‘natural colors,” of

which he distinguishes two kinds—der-

the form of very small nuclei in the 
cell, or in the product of cells, in the 
cuticula,”’ and hypodermal, where ‘‘the

to examine.) 

I may here note an interesting object 
on which to try this mode of color- 
separation —this object is the head of a 
freshly killed larva of  Sweerduthus. 
Upon the application of strong alcohol 
the tubercles lose their milky whiteness 
from the loss of air. thus proving opti- 
cal coloration. Chlorin bleaching-fluids 
rapidly destroy the green color of the 
fluids of the head, proving it to be 
hypodermal, while the outer chitin-shell, 
or covering of the head. resists all 
bleaching action, remaining green until 
it is macerated. 

After what has been given already in 
the descriptive portion of this paper 
there is little to be said, based on my 


own work, in regard to the structure of 


scales. A point worthy of mention is 
perhaps this, that I have found but one 
insect having scales or hairs, in which 
these appendages did not contain more 
orlessair. Thisinsectis Chalcolepidius. 
The elytra themselves, in many cases 
where they are white (e.g., in Crcézdela 
dorsalis), have spaces within’ them, 
besides the tracheae, reserved for air, as 
well as spaces for the fluids of the body. 
When so-called *tblooms” are present, 
as upon the dorsal surface of the abdo- 
men of some species of Zadanzzs, this

I cannot yet wholly understand why 
the scales of lepidoptera discharge the 
air contained in them so much more 
readily, when subjected to treatment with 
chloroform, than do the 


alcohol and 


scales of coleoptera, while, on the 
other hand, water will drive out the air 
from scales of coleoptera much quicker 
than from scales of lepidoptera. There 
are several things which might cause 
these phenomena, but I am inclined to 
the opinion, without having Aroved its 
correctness, that their cause is the pre- 
sence of more oil in the scales of lepido-

lepidopterous scales, and with other 


points in their appearance. Perhaps 
the entrance of the shank of the scale is 
only closed with an oily mass, for I 
have never seen the scale of a lepido- 
pteron resist entirely the entrance of 
fluid, as is often the case with the scales 
of coleoptera. 

The striae upon scales of lepidoptera 
have long been a subject of investigation. 
but, as far as I know, no one, up to 1880, 
published the fact that their striae were 
upon the outside, or upon the side turned 


away from the wing. In Burgess’ paper 
on Danazs," in that year, he figures 
transverse sections of the scales of that 
butterfly, and calls attention to the fact. 
Without having seen Burgess’ paper, 
in the following year, I noticed that the 
striae upon the scales of the proboscis 
of Crlex were on the outside, and so

by partly filling a bladder with water 
and allowing it to dry upon a board. 
The main folds will be, of course, upon 
the exposed upper side, and the longi-

Another easy way to prove that the 
striae upon the scales of the wings of 
iepidoptera are upon the side away from 
the wing is to take impressions of the 
scales upon a_ surface of collodion. 
These impressions are readily taken by 
pressing quite lightly a dry butterfly’s 
wing upon a microscope slide which 
has been moistened with a solution of 
collodion in ether. The wing should 
be removed before the collodion has 
become thoroughly dry, when beautiful

The process of transferring the scales

consists, leaving out details, in gumming 
the wing of a butterfly upon paper with

that branching or notched hairs seemed 
a characteristic of the scarasaetdae,

family of coleoptera, although, outside 
of coleoptera, they are not rare (e. ¢., 
in Bombus and other hymenoptera). 
Among the scarabae¢dae this notching, 
or covering of the surface of the hairs 
with secondary hairs, extends also to 
the scales, and we have some that, like

THE CLASSIFICATION 


BY VACTOR 


My attention has just been called to 
an article by Mr. Grote in Pafz//o, 
vol. 3. On page 43 he writes ‘*I do 
not wish to enter into an argument as 
to the best classification of the ¢é7e¢dae, 
but disagreeing with Mr. Chambers, I do 
not think any one would take Axaphora 
for any thing but a tineid ;” and on page 
38 he writes, ‘‘So far as I have studied 
them we appear to be able to classify our 
moths under sphingidae— tinetdae’’, 
&amp;c., &amp;c., naming the families usually 
adopted. I refer to this subject because

the scales in a drop of some quickly 
evaporating substance — chloroform is 
best for most purposes —on the slides. 
The scales will form in a_ kind of 
whirlpool, nearly all the scales finally 
settling down, as the liquid evaporates, 
in one place on the slide. Rapping the 
slide gently sometimes aids in the collect- 
ing together of the scales, and the tip 
of the scalpel used to scrape the scales 
from the insect can be washed in the 
drop of chloriform, thus saving every 
scale when they are from a rare speci-

only a few scales. By inclining the

in response to one by Lord Walsing-

‘It is surely easier at first sight to sepa-

my view it (the ¢7zez/ae of these au-

of moths as that would be which should 
contain the dombycidae, noctutdae, gco- 
metridae, tortricidae and pyralidae 
thrown into one: the species or genera 
coniprised in it have no unity of struc- 
ture, habit; metamorphosis, life-history, 
habitat, or ornamentation, and a family 
which comprises the genera referred to 
above (and others equally heterogene- 
ous) might just as consistently contain all 
lepidoptera heterocera at once: it would 
then scarcely be more mixed that it. is 
now. I don’t like to dissent from such 
able and distinguished entomologists as 
Lord Walsingham and Mr. Grote, but 
truth is better even than good company. 

I have stated elsewhere that I thought 
Stephens’ classification of the ¢7xe¢dae 
thoroughly vicious. This language is 
too strong. I will say rather that I 
think his classification radically bad in 
so much as it gives too much weight 
to the presence of both pairs of palpi. 
and their size — it is too much a palpal 
classification — not consistently carried 


out. and one which it seems to me im-

which places all of the genera known 
to Stephens and many others in a single 
family. The objection to Stephens’ 
arrangement is that it does not recognise 
families enough, and my objection to 
Mr. Stainton’s classification is that it 
recognises perhaps Mr.

cuolletidae, together with Phy/locnristis, 
instead of forming two families and 
part of a third, form together a single, 
well defined family. The structure and 
metamorphoses of the larvae and pupae 
seem to me to separate these moths 
from all of the known ¢2zezdae, and to 
unite them in a single natural group

development from anything that is 
known elsewhere among lepidoptera :

I incline to include the last three, at all 
events, in a single family. A large 
number of genera of his family e/a-

the eelechidae, but there will still re-

history, habitat, form and ornamenta- 
tion, can be thrown into a single group, 
the equivalent of a single family of the 
higher heterocera, I cannot compre- 
hend; but it seems to me — with the 
greatest deference for such authorities 
as Lord Walsingham and Mr. Grote— 
that in all of the particulars just enu- 
merated, the insects associated by them 
under the common family name ¢27ez- 
dae present family characters in variety 
as great as or even greater than all 
other heterocera combined. 

Like Mr. Grote I do not desire any 
controversy on this subject, and have

shall say upon it, and here take my fare- 
well of it, hoping that nothing I have

least degree wanting in respect to either 
of the distinguished gentlemen above-

An example of this butterfly, which is gen- 
erally regarded as a rarity by collectors, was 
captured at Center, N. Y., 25 May 1878, 
by Mr. O. von Meske—its first observation 
for this locality. It had been taken 
instances, many years ago, by Mr. Charles 
H. Peck, at Bath, near Albany, and had also 
been observed by him in Sandlake, N. Y., 
and Elizabethtown, N.Y., flying about bushes 
of alder (Alnus serrulata Ait.). Its appear-

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 
ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON. 


17 JAN. 1883.—It was announced that the 
prize of £50, offered by Lord Walsingham, 
for the best essay on Sclerostoma syngamus, 
had been awarded to Dr Mégnin, of Paris 
(two competitors); no 
Strongylus pergracil?s had been received, 

The following officers were elected : —Pres- 
ident, J. W. Dunning; Treasurer, E. Saun- 
ders; Secretaries, E. A. Fitch and W. F. 
Kirby; Librarian, F. Grut. 

5 Fes. 1883.—Mr. Billups exhibited an 
exotic orthopterous insect of the family 
locustidae, found living in a hot-house at 


essay regarding 


Lee ; it was strongly carnivorous in its habits. 

Mr. Peringuey communicated notes on the 
habits of several South African species of 
Paussus, and especially in connection with 
their powers of crepitating, and carnivorous 
propensities. 

7 Marcu 1883.—Dr. Sharp exhibited a 
dissection of the prosternum of an Elazer, 
and called attention to the peculiar condition 
of the prothoracic stigma, which was closed 
by a perfect trap-door. He thought this 
arrangement might be useful in excluding 
parasites when the beetle was on its back, 
after the manner of its kind. 

2 May 1883.—This being the soth anniver- 
sary of the foundation of the society, the 
President read a historical sketch, in which 
he succinctly embodied all points of interest 
concerning its career, and the benefits it had

conferred upon entomological science in 
general. Only six of the original members 
still survive, viz. : Prof. C. C. Babington, the 
Rev. L. Blomefield, Sir S. S. Saunders, Mr. 
W. B. Spence, Mr. G. R. Waterhouse, and 
Prof. Westwood. He expressed a hope that 
the number of members would be very large- 
ly increased before the end of the jubilee 
year. In concluding his address, he sugges- 
ted that Prof. Westwood be elected titular 
Life-President of the society, accompanying 
his suggestion by eulogistic remarks on the 
career of our veteran entomologist, and his 
labors in the cause of entomology. This 
was adopted by acclamation. 

The meeting was then made “special,” in 
order to consider certain proposed alterations 
in the by-laws. Some of the propositions 
were adopted, others rejected. The chief 
resultant alterations were as follows :—No 
‘“‘subscribers” will be henceforth elected: the 
“Transactions” will be sent without further 
payment to all members not in arrear with 
their subscriptions: notice is to be given of 
names proposed to be substituted for those 
recommended for officers and council before 
the annual meeting, such proposed substitu- 
tions (if any) to be notified by circular to 
the members.—Selected from Extomologist’s 


mo. magazine. 


ZOOLOGICAL SociETY OF LONDON. 


19 Dec. 1882.—Mr. Arthur G. Butler read 
a paper in which he gave an account of a 
collection of spiders made by the Rev. Deans 
Cowan in Madagascar. In addition to many 
interesting and singular forms were speci- 
mens of the curious tailed species, Arach- 
noura scorpionides from central Madagascar. 
Six new species were described. 

5 June 1883.—Mr. G. French Angas ex-

a recent visit to the island of Dominica, W. I.

species of spiders. Eight spiders, represen- 
ting as many new genera, were described; 
two of them belonged to the family ¢herapho- 
sidae. one to the drassidae, and the others 
to the ¢homisidae. Three of these species 
were from Ceylon, three from Caffraria, one 
from New Zealand, and one from California. 

A communication was read from Mr. Her- 
bert Druce, containing descriptions of some 
new species of moths of the families zygae- 
nidae and arctitdae, mostly collected in 
Ecquador, by Mr. C. Buckley. The number 
of new species described was fifty, belonging 
to twenty-four genera.

25 ApriL 1883.— Mr. Macleay exhibited 
specimens of a small moth (¢/nertdae), the 
larva of which was at present creating great 
havoc in the vegetable gardens in and about 
Sidney, completely eating up the leaves of 
the cabbages and cauliflowers, and rendering 
the entire crop utterly useless. The cater- 
pillar, a number of which were exhibited, is 
an active, slightly hairy, green worm, the 
pupa is also green and is fastened on the 
under side of the leaf on which it has fed, 
by a cocoon of beautiful open lace work. 
The rapidity with which this insect seems 
to reproduce itself is most astounding, and 
accounts for the short work it makes of a 
bed of cabbages. The insect was, it is said, 
first noticed last year, and then not in de- 
structive numbers, so that it will probably 
be found to be an importation. 

Professor Stevens exhibited a chrysalis ot 
a Danats, secured by a silk line to a leaf of 
an exotic Pelargonitum.—Zool. anzeiger, 9

FROM SEVERAL parts of Sweden the ap-

consumes the crops, is reported. Its length 
is from one inch to one and a half, and its 
color grey-brown with green stripes. In one 
place it put in an appearance immediately 
after a violent storm with rain. The Acade- 
my of agriculture has despatched an ento-

M. Freperica, of Liége, says the English 
mechanic, lately put several aquatic coleoptera 
(including the great water beetle) in aqueous 
solution of curare and strychnine in poison- 
ous quantity. A few drops of these liquors 
sufficed to poison a frog ina few minutes. 
The insects, lived in them, some 


more than a fortnight, others nearly a month 


sen the general 


however, 


(when the experiment was concluded). These 
coleoptera are certainly sensible to the action 
of curare and strychnine, and the absence 
of symptoms of poisoning in the present 
case must be (the author says) because the 
absorption by the surface of the body and 
the mouth was w7/. M. Plateau has previous- 
ly observed that aquatic coleoptera kept in 
sea water do not absorb its salts. —Amer.

In a brief paper upon ‘Insects injurious 
to fruit,” by Mrs. Mary Treat, read before 
the New Jersey state horticultural society, 
at its annual meeting in January last, among 
other items of interest, a statement was made 
ofa remarkable collection of *‘cut-worms” by 
the writer, which may serve to show the 
value of the same method of dealing with 
these notorious pests, when employed upon a 
larger scale. Some phlox bordering a car- 
riage-way through an orchard of dwarf pear 
trees was observed one morning to be partly 
denuded of its leaves and flower-buds. The 
cause being suspected, it was examined the 
following evening witha light, when ‘‘un- 
told numbers of cut-worms were seen among 
the flower-buds.”” Numerous worms were 
at work on the branches of a plum tree 
beside them. A large number of worms 
were found eating into the just expanding 
buds of the pear-trees. 

The soil around the phlox was examined, 
and the first collection resulted in over a 
pint of worms of various sizes. The best 
time for this search was found to be about 
dusk in the evening, for the worms were 
thea just beneath the surface of the ground.

themselves from their natural homes 


into climates unsuitable for them, or 


from those which are always to be

be expected. 

‘* In the first class of cases an exam- 
ple occurred to me a few years ago 
which seems very much to the point.” 

From eggs of Detopeta pulchella 
received from the south of France some 
moths were, by great care and assiduity, 
reared to maturity in England, and 
from these were obtained fertile eggs, 


which duly hatched. Only about half 


a dozen of the larvae seemed to possess 
sufficient vitality to feed. These were 
fed on potted plants, grown in a sunny 
window, where they, covered with 
gauze, **grew rapidly. feeding with es- 
pecial eagerness when the sun was shi- 
ning onthem. The weather happened to 
be fine and the sun hot for two or three 
weeks just at that time, and one larva 
made such progress that ina fortnight it 
was full-fed, when it spun a very slight 
cocoon on the gauze and turned safely 
to pupa. By this time two more larvae 
were full-fed and left the food-plant for 
the gauze, the rest being fully half- 
grown, when a change of weather 
came, with wind, heavy rain, and a 
total absence of sunshine. The larvae 
were, of course, not exposed to the

ordinary habits, cross land or sea, ar- 
riving, of course, very often, in some 
inhospitable clime, where—if not at

fall victims to some pitiless storm of 
wind and rain. But supposing both

the natural constitution of the species 
is able to endure, the young larvae die 
without even attempting to feed, but if 
matters are more favourable, the strong- 
est of them struggle along, and if fairly 
favoured by the weather a few of them 
may reach the perfect state; if quite

Such good for- 
tune rarely extends to a second season 
and the species becomes a rarity again 
or is even probably exterminated, to be 
renewed at some future time by the same 
instinct of migration. In cases such 
as these it appears to me that sunshine 
means life, and its absence destruction, 
to the larvae, and that by this simple 
and obvious influence the extension of 
species beyond their assigned limits is 
practically prohibited. 

‘*It also happens sometimes that the 
immigrant, following instinctively its 
inherited habit, attempts to produce azz 
additional brood in the year, over what 
the climate will allow.” For instance, 
pupae of the second brood of Co//as

‘which only shows itself when the 
insect is nearly ready to emerge,” thus 
‘*following inherited habit so as to 
hibernate, as they are well known to 
do [on the continent of Europe] in the 
perfect state, but 


from insufficient 


warmth and sunshine were unable to 
muster sufficient strength,” and died. 
Again, in the autumn of 1880, in 
which year there had been a wonderful 
immigration of Vanessa carduz into 
England, evidently a portion of the 
vast army that migrated across Europe, 
larvae were found tolerably common, 
feeding, at the beginning of October, 
on young thistle plants, close to the 
ground, making their nests among the 
radical leaves, all the tall thistles being 
From some of these larvae two 
pupae were obtained, in doors, 17 and

surely explains, in some degree, the 
fact that last year [1881] the insect was 
more than usually scarce, hardly any 
appearing to have hibernated, and also 
why an insect with such power of 
increase in a suitable climate is so un- 
certain and variable in its appearances 
in one that is unfavorable. 

‘* With reference to the second class 
of cases — those in which a species 
always present is periodically common 
or scarce—much has been written, 
excessive razz being usually assigned 
as the cause of diminution in numbers, 
sunshine as the cause of increase.

there had been little or no intense cold

appeared to be almost absent; such a 
dearth of ordinary night-flying species 
I never knew anywhere before. 

‘* But in the winter of 1875, there 
was a great change. Persistent north 
or northeast winds, intensely cold, froze 
everything up hard, the warm sea air 
was completely expelled, or if a slight 
change of wind permitted a few clouds 
to come over, the rain from them was 
nistantly converted into ice, with which

the high roads were coated to a thick- 
ness of three or four inches [7.6 to 10.2 
cm. ]. for weeks. 

‘** The winters of 1879 and 1880 were 
equally cold, indeed, the latter was said 
to be the coldest known here for fifty 
years, even the sea sands along the tide 
line were covered ankle deep with ice 
and frozen snow, a sight very rarely seen 


on this coast. The first of these three 


winters [1578-1879] killed all the 
shrubby veronicas and some of the 
sumachs, and the tree fuchsias and 


myrtles above the ground. 

** And now I will give the results as 
regards insects.” . 

Lepidoptera which before were ex- 
ceedingly rare became more and more 
abundant in 1879, 1880, and 1881, until 
in the last year they actually abounded. 
Species previously restricted to a few 
favorite spots spread all along the coast 
or over the country. Many Geometrae 
turned up which had hardly been seen 
before.

was the most remarkable. as in that 
group the scarcity had been most 


marked.” [Mentions numerous spe-

‘*On the other hand there can be no 
doubt that mild winters act directly to 
cause the destruction of both hiberna-

is by encouraging the growth of mould, 
which we know attacks them as soon

mammalia destroy great 
Lepidopterous pupae, and they abound 


in this district, as also do birds during 


numbers of 


the winter in an extraordinary degree. 
As soon as severe cold sets in to the 
north and east, the birds come down 
in swarms to the open fields and shel-

at that time, and. indeed, are not very 
plentiful in Pembrokeshire, they must 
destroy many larvae and pupae, having 
little else to subsist upon. But I believe 
that the mischief done by all

‘During mild winters these crusta-

in so mild a climate they become a per-

nuisance, pervading everything 
to keep them even out of the breeding 
cages, where they would get introduced 
when very small and unnoticed — or 
perhaps in the egg state — hunt out and 
destroy every larva and pupa, and grow 
large and plump without ever showing 
themselves 
bish. Doubtless, their industry out of 


above the leaves and rub- 
doors was in the same proportion, and 
my impression is that they approached 
very near to completely exterminating 
many species that would naturally be 
common here. Severe cold seems to 
destroy some of them, for they are not 
nearly so numerous now, and it cer- 
tainly puts a complete stop to their 
destructive operations during a_ time 
when larvae are most especially helpless 
and liable to attack. To this, with other 
causes already mentioned, I am inclined 
to attribute the extraordinary increase 
in numbers of so many species during 
the last three seasons, divided by severe 
winters. The winter now past has 
been mild, and, therefore, a further pro- 
gressive increase cannot reasonably be 
expected; but I hope that the mischief 
done in one mild winter may not be

serious. It is the progressive increase 
of destroyers with the decrease of vic- 
tims through successive mild seasons 
that is really to be dreaded. 

‘© As a slight corroboration of this 
view, I may mention, that while this 
district of country is comparatively poor 
in all the species of which the larvae feed 
and hibernate in any exposed situation, 
several species of Noctuae, of which 
the larvae live underground, are always 


abundant. and the country is actually

cina which feed and hibernate entirely 
within the stalks or roots of plants. 

“It is worthy of notice, that there 
are a very few species which have 
appeared unable to cope with severe 
cold. Lobophora viretata was tolera- 
bly common here during the first three 
or four years of which I have been 
writing, but after the first cold winter 
it became scarce, and has since almost 


disappeared.”

[Abstract of a dissertation by Paulus Schiemenz. } 


BY GEORGE 


Paulus Schiemenz’ dissertation **Uber 
das herkommen des futtersaftes und die 
speicheldriisen der biene”... [Rec., no. 
3337] gives many interesting facts in the 
anatomy of the honey-bee and of other 
bees. The beginning of this paperisa 
historical consideration of the subject, 
with a description of the digestive tract 
of Apzs mellifica, in which the author 
follows Plateau’s view that the proven- 
triculus serves to arrest the too rapid 
flow of the of the (or 
honey-stomach, as  Schiemenz here 


contents crop 


terms it) into the ventricle. Following 
the views of Leuckart, in whose labora- 
tory Schiemenz prepared this paper, the 
author considers that the ileum of the 
bees, as of insects in general, has no 
other function than that of furnishing a 
ventricle

not come from the ventricle, as has been 
often supposed. The salivary glands 
are next described, and their secretions 
and histological structure discussed, in 
the order introduced for them by Sie- 
bold, i. e., as ‘‘system 1, 1m, 11, Iv and 
eee 

The gland of system 1 (Meckel’s su- 
pramaxillary gland) is provided with a 
reservoir and discharges its strongly acid 
secretion by openings, one on each side 
of the “Schlundbliittchen” [hypopharynx 
of Savigny]. This gland is absent in 
queens and drones. In six species of 
Bombus this system is well developed, 
and the author describes various modi- 
fications in other bees. 

The glands of system 11 (Meckel’s glan- 
dula sublingualis) are in the head, just 
aboye its lower or posterior chitinous 
walls, and are easiest prepared by first 
removing system 1, and then the brain. 
The different efferent ducts of the parts 


88 ESC LE. 


of this system of glands unite on each 
side, and the ducts resulting from their 
union join the duct from system m1 at 
right angles, forming a cruciform figure. 
The secretion of system 1 is slightly 
alkaline and leaves a fatty spot upon 
the test-paper. Queen bees have sys- 
tem 1m similar to that of workers, but 
in drones its place is occupied by a 
mass of yellow fat-cells, which cannot 
secrete and which the author follows 
Pagenstecher in regarding as results of 
degeneration. Inthe male of Bomdus 
this system occupies nearly the whole 
head, while in the females and workers 
it is less developed proportionally than 
in Ais. System m is 
Psithyrus, Megachile and 


present in 

Coelioxys, 
but absent in all other bees examined 
by the author, e. g., in Hylaeus, Dich- 
roa, Dasypoda, Andrena, Osmia, An- 
thidium, Colletes, Melecta and An- 
thophora. 

System 11 consists of a pair of glands 
in the anterior part of the thorax, each 
gland having a reservoir, and each open- 
ing by a duct which passes forward in- 
to the head, the two ducts there uniting 
to form the common duct of this system, 
with which (as mentioned before) the 
two ducts of system 1 unite at right an- 
gles to form a cross, the combined effer- 
ent duct of systems 1 and 11 forming the 
fourth, or anterior, branch of the cross, 
The secretion of the glands of system 
m1 is slightly alkaline or neutral. In 
queens and drones, particularly in the 
latter, this system of glands is of similar 
structure, but not so strongly developed 
as in workers. The reservoir is differ- 


ently proportioned in queen, drone

is greatest. System 1 is not as well 
developed, relatively, in other bees as it 
is in Apis.

119), 
cites as Hyatt, but whose description 


This system of glands is 


and figured by Spaulding 


whom Schiemenz incorrectly 
he rightly says ‘‘gives only the crudest 
outlines and even these inaccurately.” 

System iv, described minutely by 
Wolff and noticed by Graber, consists of 
two glands, one on each side, opening by 
a short duct upon the inner side of the 
base of each mandible, and giving out 
a strongly odorous and very acid liquid. 
If a mandible is torn from a bee’s head 
the gland usually hangs to the base of 
the mandible as a little sac. In queen 
bees system Iv is very strongly devel- 
oped, in workers well developed, but 
has suffered a degeneration in drones, in 
which the gland, altho still present, 
secretes nothing. System rv is present, 
more or less developed, iu all bees. 

System v. which is not present in Apzs 
mellifica, but exists in Bombus and 
some other genera, consists of an un- 
paired gland which opens into the out- 
let of the common duct of systems 1 
and ut. This system was not very fully 
studied by the author, its function prob- 
ably being only that of lubrication. 

In studying the development of these 
glands, which he considers at length, 
Schiemenz shows that systems 1 and 1v 
are entirely new formations from epi- 
dermal invagination, system 111 is partly 
developed from the silk-glands of the 
larva, and systems u and v are derived 
later from the duct of system 11.

these glands opportunity was taken of 


proving that Engelmann’s — so-called

thought that system rv was a gland for 
moistening an olfactory organ beneath 
the labrum, the place where Wolff, in 
his wild search for analogies between 
vertebrates and insects, had located the 
olfactory organ of the bee. Schiemenz 
regards the glands of system rv as used 
of food, 


system 1 as producing, in

the larvae. The functions of the other 
systems still remain doubtful.

nae of Afzs mellzfica, since it is now 
settled that the antennae are the seat of 
the olfactory sense.

A part of the species of the genus 
Torymus and of the genera Syntom- 
aspis and Megastigmus are constant 
parasites in galls on oak, like Ortopelma 
and Torymus bedeguarts in rose-galls 
and Limnerta chrysosticta in willow- 
galls. Vhe genera Syxergus, Eury- 
toma and Decatoma are all secondary 
parasites, that is to say, they attack in 
the gall- 
and destroy them. The 
other pteromalini (Lutelus, Platyter- 
mus, Labrocytus, etc.) are probably 


their turn parasites on

also secondary parasites. In regard to 


Aulax brandt?, on the other hand, 
which often occurs so numerously in 
bedeguars, it can hardly be considered 
as a parasite, since all its congeners 
form gall-like swellings on the branches 
of plants or live in swollen seed-cap- 
sules. but it may be considered to be 
an inquiline or the possible fellow-build-

15 Fes. 1883.—Mr. J. Jenner Weir exhibit- 
ed a perfect hermaphrodite butterfly (Ly- 
caena tcarus,) and a blue male and a brown 
female of the same species for comparison. 
The hermaphrodite in question possesses two 
spotless blue wings on the left, and two spot- 
less brown wings on the right, thus being 
intermediate in color between the two sexes. 

A paper was read on the manna insect of 
South Australia, by J. G. Otto Tepper. This 
contains observations on the insect in ques- 
tion. and on the peculiar saccharine substance 
derived from and deposited on various species 
of Eucalyptus trees. 

t Marcu 1883.—Mr. Alfred W. Bennett 
read a paper *‘On the constancy of insects in 
their visits to flowers.” He stated as asum- 
mary that the different classes of insects show 
very great difference in this respect. Butter- 
flies show but little constancy except in a few 
instances: but they would appear to be guided 
to a certain extent by a preference for par- 
ticular colors. The diptera exhibit greater 
constancy, though by no means absolute. A 
much greater degree of constancy is mani- 
fested by the afrdae: and this becomes all 


[September—October 1883. 
but absolute in the hive-bee. It is an inter- 
esting circumstance that this constancy ap- 
pedrs to increase in proportion to the part 
performed by the insects in carrying pollen 
from flower to flower. A much larger num- 
ber of observations is however needed in or- 
der to determine with certainty any general 
law ; and especially a careful microscopic ex- 
amination of the pollen attached to the pro- 
boscis, mandibles, legs, and under side of the 


abdomen andthorax. As respects preference 
for particular colors, the lepidoptera observed 
paid 70 visits to red or pink flowers, 5 toblue, 
15 to yellow, 5 to white ; the diptera 9 to red 
or pink,.8 to yellow, 20 to white ; the hy- 
menoptera 303 to red or pink, 126 to blue, 11 
to yellow, 17 to white.

LONDON LETTER. 


East Dutwicu. LoNnpon, 
Jury 6th. 1883. 

Perhaps the most interesting information 

to American entomologists is that relating 

to the progress of Godman and Salvin’s 

great work—the *‘Biologia Centrali-Ameri- 

cana.” This has now appeared with most 

commendable punctuality during the last 

three vears, and the following is an abstract 
of its progress to date.

To this may be added the first hymeno- 
pteral contribution of Mr. P. Cameron, which 
has just appeared. This fauna includes the 
whole of Mexico and extends as far south 
as the Isthmus of Darien. Some idea as to 
the extent of the work remaining to be 
completed can be gathered from observing 


the many families and some orders of insects 
which have not as yet been commenced. My 
own contribution devoted to the rhynchota 
has only just reached the cafszdae, but it has 
already dealt with some matters of interest 
to Nearctic entomologists, such as the dis- 


covery of the *‘Chinch Bug,” Bl/ssus leuco-

pterus extending southward through Mexico, 
Guatemala and Panama. 

Dr. Leitner, of Basle, has passed the last 
nine or ten months in this country, studying 
—both in the British Museum 
different private 


and at the 
collections —the polymor- 
phism of lucanoid beetles comprised in the 
odontolabidae, with the view to an explana- 
tion of the evolution of the mandibles and 
of the strongly marked sexual dimorphism. 
Dr. Leitner considers the female to exhibit 
(in this case) the archaic type, and his 
memoir will probably be published by one of 
our London societies about the end of the 
year. 

Perhaps at no previous period in the study 
of lépidoptera has so much complete faunis- 
tic work been in the course of publication 
as at the present time. Thus in your own 
country appears the excellent work of 
Edwards on the Butterflies of North America, 
whilst Godman and Salvin are publishing 
their monograph of the rhopalocera of 
Dr. 
Burmeister is doing a similar service for 
the lepidoptera of the. Argentine Republic. 
In London Lang is publishing his ‘‘European 
Butterflies” whilst as regards the east, 
Moore’s ‘‘Lepidoptera of Ceylon,” Marshall 
and de Niceville’s ‘‘Butterflies of India, 
Burmah and Ceylon,” and my own ‘‘Rho- 


Central America, and, farther south, 


palocera Malayana” are regularly appearing 
and sufficiently attest the amount of pub- 
lishing energy in this field. 

Very few entomological collections have 
recently been received from the neotropical 
region. Mr. Champion has just returned 
from Central America bringing the remain- 
der of the best collection—in view of the 
number of minute and carefully mounted 
specimens —ever made in the tropics. Dr. 
Angas has brought home from Dominica a 
small but interesting collection, and in all 
probability the next lot of entomological 
novelties from this region will be received in 
America from Herbert

the titles of several articles by him, making 
in all at least sixty titles, and many of these 
are in fact series of separate articles, appear- 
ing under the same word-title throughout a 
volume. Mr. Chambers was singularly un- 
fortunate in the treatment he received from 
his proof-readers, in some of the publications 
where most of his articles appeared, and 
rendered the citation of his articles especially 
difficult by the similarity which he gave to 
their titles. A brief biographical sketch of 
him appears in Scrence, 24 Aug. 1883, v. 2.

IPS MCs: 


A NEW SEXUAL CHARACTER IN THE PUPAE OF SOME 
LEPIDOPTERA. 


BY JOSEPH ALBERT LINTNER, ALBANY, N. Y. 


{Read before the American association for the advancement of science at its 
Montreal meeting, August 1882. ] 


The

sexual characters of insects 
to the entomological student, the more 
so as they are the less apparent, and 
discoverable, if to be found at all, only 
and 


as the result of close observation 


comparison. In the larger proportion 
of insects, in the perfect stage, they are 
so marked as to leave no doubt of the 
sex when the male and female are com- 
pared. Thus, in the hymenoptera, we 
have the ovipositor in its varied forms, 
often quite conspicuous. In the lepi- 
doptera, among the heferocera, there are 
usually the more fully developed anten- 
nae of the male, and the broader, conical 
and more capacious abdomen of the 
female—features attaining their maxi- 
mum development in the family of 
bombycidae. In the diptera, there are 
the larger and more approximate eyes 
in the male, and conspicuous structural 
differences in the antennae and suctorial 
apparatus in some of the families. In 
the coleoptera, there are often, in the 
male, stouter legs, broader tarsi, greatly 
elongated mandibles and other horn-like

cicadidae, the ovipositor in several of 


the families, and the great sexual differ- 
ences in size and in the presence or 
absence of wings are prominent features. 
In the orthoptera, there are the stridula- 
ting wing-nerves, the extended oviposi- 
tor, and a genital armature greatly varied 
in its adaptation to greatly diflering

habits. And in the neuroptera, 
tinctive male characters 
clasping organs, in differences in color 
and in size, the long mandibles of 
Corydalus, the abnormal location of the 
intromittent organ in /¢bel/ulédae, and in 
the elongated and forcipated genitalia 
of Panorpa. 

In addition to such primary features 
as above noted, there are numerous sec- 
ondary ones, which do not appear to be 
so dependent upon sex, and many of 
which seem almost to serve no higher 
purpose than that of ornamentation. 
Yet it is reasonable to believe that most 
of these differences have their use in the 
economy of nature, and that they aid 
in the continuance of the species. 

Among such minor antigenetical fea- 
tures, may be mentioned, in the lepi- 
doptera, the usually more angulated 
wings of the male; the simple frenulum 


of most of the male eferocera in con- 


104 


trast with the compound one in the 


female; the hairy anterior legs of 
Grapta and Vanessa in the nympha- 
lidae; the long hairs between the costal 
and subcostal nervures, above the cell 
of the hind wings of Argynnzs, appear- 
ing, when extended in the cabinet, like 
a long fringe to the inner margin of the 
front wings ; the incrassated, black scale- 
(the 
Ist median nervule) of the secondaries 
of Danas; the ovoid discal spot onthe 
front wings of many of the ¢Lec/énae ; in 


patch upon the middle of vein 2 


the hesperidae, the reflexed costal mar- 
gin in most of the Wésoréades, Euda- 
mus, and Pyrgus, and the tibial epi- 
physis? of the anterior legs in all but one 
of our genera; the transverse discoidal 
stigma on the primaries of the larger 
portion of our pamphilas, the beautiful 
and peculiar microscopic (often con- 
cealed) scales, or androconia, of many 
of the butterflies ; the usually concealed 
pair of extensile anal appendages found 
by Fritz Miiller and others in certain 
glaucopidae, bombycidae, noctuidae 
and in a Danazs ;* each of these indica- 
ting the male sex. Features equally 
interesting, and alike serving no pur- 
pose so far as known, might be men- 
tioned in each of the orders of insects. 
In the earlier stages of insects (egg 
and larval), sexual features, as would 
naturally be expected, are less numer-

The young collector of insects learns 
very early the simple method of determi-

of many other bombycid pupae, by 
observation of the comparative breadth 
of their antennal cases.

Dr. C. V. Riley, in the Transactions 
of the academy of science of St. Louis, 
1873, vol. 3, p. 128-129, and in the 6th 
annual report of the state entomologist 
of Missouri, for 1873, 1874, p. 131-132, 
has described and figured sexual difler- 
ences in the pupae of Pronubha yuc- 
casella, consisting, mainly, in the great- 
er length of the ‘‘dorsal projections” on 
the several segments of the male, in the 
length of the last two segments as com- 
pared with those of the female (its 
shorter 11th and longer 12th), and in 
its less rounded apex. He says: ‘‘sex- 
ual distinctions are very rarely observa- 
ble in chrysalids ; but after I had learned 
to distinguish between them, I could 
readily separate the sexes in this case, 
and my judgment was confirmed upon 
the issuing of the moths.” 

A few years ago | discovered an in- 
teresting feature in the armature of the 


species of Cossws, by which the sex

may at once be determined. I have, 
hitherto, withheld its publication, until 
I had studied others of our spined pupae 
and could illustrate this feature by proper 
figures ; but the opportunity for this has 
not been found, and I accordingly defer 
no longer calling attention to it, that the 
observations of others in possession of 
more abundant material may supple- 
ment the few that have been made by 
me. 

It is known to lepidopterists that 
most of the pupae of the species of 
moths which in their larval stage live 
in the interior of stems of plants and 
trunks of trees (endophytes), are armed 
upon their abdominal segments with 
transverse rows of teeth or spines, by 
the aid of which, when they are in 
readiness for their final transformation, 
they gradually work their way through 
the outer packing of their gallery and 
the bark, project their anterior segments 
to at least one-third the entire pupal 
length through the opening, and hold 
themselves securely during the eclosion 
of the moth. 

This useful armature in the coss¢xae, 
and in such of the aegerié7dae as 
I have had the opportunity of ex- 
amining, consists of two rows of 
spines upon most of the abdominal seg- 
ments, dividing them, when seen in 
extension, in three nearly equal parts. 
In Cossus robiniae, the species of the 
cossinae with which we are probably 
the most familiar, these rows occur on 
the fifth (the first stigmatal segment 
posterior to the wing-cases) and the 
following segments. 


In Cossus querciperda alone of the 


610 PSYCHE. 


species known to me, they commence 


in a single row of minute denta- 
tions on the fourth segment. The prin- 
cipal features of this armature are the 
following :—It is always the stronger in 
the male sex—conspicuously so in C. 
robiniae, but less so in C. center- 
ensis: the teeth increase in size from 
the fifth to the tenth 


anterior row is always the stronger in 


segment: the 


each sex; upon the fifth and sixth seg- 
ments, it does not, in its lateral exten- 
sion, reach below the stigma,® while 
upon the following segments it passes in 
front of the stigma and quite a distance 
beneath it: the posterior row is discon- 
tinued before reaching the line of the 
stigmata: the teeth show irregularity in 
form and size, particularly those of the 
posterior row. 

The sexual distinction above referred 
to, presented in this armature, is this: in 
the male pupae two rows of teeth occur 
on segments five to ten inclusive ; in the 
female, two rows on five to nine inclu- 
sive. In other words, the male pupa 
shows TWO rows of teeth on segment 
ten, where the female shows but ONE. 
In each sex, the eleventh and twelfth have 
but a single row.  Disregarding, as I 
think we should in ordinary usage, the 
subdivision of what is usually known as 
the terminal segment, into demi-seg- 
ments, or a segment and a subsegment, 
and that still farther refinement which 
would make of the extreme portion 
an additional segment with full numeri- 
cal designation, then it will serve to 
prevent misapprehension of the parti-

cular section showing the sexual feature, 
if we indicate it as the axtefenultimate 
segment. It would be the eleventh, if 
we commence enumeration, as some of 
our entomologists do, with the head, but 
the tenth, if, as seems to me more pro- 
per, we begin with the first thoracic 
ring.

only the pupae of Aegerta exttéosa and 
A. tipuliformés, and it exists in each. 
It probably occurs in the pupae of 
Zeuzera (one North American species 
described), in which the two rows of 
teeth are found on several of the seg- 
ments, and perhaps also in Flepialus, 
the pupae of which (unknown to me) 
are characterized as very similar to 
those of Cosszs. 

Another interesting fact connected 
with the armature of Cosszs is that the 
form, size, and position of the teeth vary 
to so great an extent in the different 
species, and show such distinctive char- 
acters, as to afford excellent specific 
features.". I would not hesitate to pro- 
nounce upon specific identity, upon an 
examination and comparison of the 


pupal armature alone. 


7¥For comparison with other species of the cossinae 
it may be stated that an example of C. cenferensis ¢&amp; 
has thirty-eight teeth in the anterior row of the tenth 
segment, and twenty teeth in the posterior row —the 
latter, in their entire range, occupying a transverse 
space equal to that of nine teeth of the anterior row. 
The teeth are black, shining, irregular in size, and are 
slightly bent upward over their base; their length and 
the distance between their tips exceeds their basal 
width

TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN LAWRENCE LECONTE. 


BY CHARLES 


Dr. John Lawrence LeConte died at 
his residence in Philadelphia, 15 Nov. 
1883. 
render the memory of him more lasting 


Nothing that we can say will 


or more dear, for he achieved pre- 


eminence in his chosen field of labor 
and won the love and respect of all who 
knew him. 

LeConte was born in New York, 13 
May 1825, and was graduated JAZ. D. by 
the College of physicians and surgeons 
in 1846. He moved to Philadelphia 
some years later, and after his marriage 
abandoned the practice of medicine. 
He was lieutenant-colonel and medical 
inspector in the United States army dur- 
ing the civil war and, from 1878 till the 
time of his death, chief clerk in the 
United States mint at Philadelphia. 

Luckily for American natural science 
his fortune was such that, with these 
two exceptions, he held no positions, 
but was able to devote his time to ento- 
mology. His chosen specialty was the 
coleoptera, and in order to fully appre- 
ciate the magnitude of the work which 
the difficulties 
with which he had to contend, it is 


he accomplished and 
necessary to consider the state of ento- 
mology in this country as compared 
with Europe at the time he began to 
write, now almost forty years ago. 
Great activity at that time prevailed in 
Europe in all branches of entomology.

ville, Solier, Stephens and others were 
active at that period. Others equally 
eminent had died shortly before and 
many came into prominence — shortly 
afterward. Naturalists there were aided 
as well by the large number of skilled 
and enthusiastic amateurs who furnished 
an abundance of material and observa- 
tions, as by the numerous large libra- 
ries, public museums and private collec- 
tions to which they had access. Numer- 
ous entomological societies also brought 
the workers together, gave stimulus and 
encouragement and offered ready means 
of publishing. 

How diflerent the circumstances in 
America at that time! In the whole 
country there were no more persons 
scientifically interested in entomology 
than could be found in a single large 
city of Europe. The larger libraries 
were scant of entomological literature 
and there were neither standard nor 
public collections and but few private 
collections, of limited size. The most 
important of the older collections, viz., 
that made by Thomas Say, had been 
irretrievably lost through carelessness 
and indifference, while other valuable 
collections had shared no better fate. 
Contributions to the knowledge of our 
coleopterous fauna consisted chiefly of 
disconnected descriptions of single spe- 
cies scattered through all sorts of publi-

rectly interpreting these descriptions, 
involving so much labor and _ patient 
study, was performed almost alone by 
LeConte, and so well that but few spe- 
cies of the older authors remain to-day 
unidentified. LeConte clearly saw from 
the beginning that American coleopte- 
rology could not be so much advanced 
by mere descriptions of new species and 
genera as by conscientious monographic 
work. The number of such monogra- 
phic and synoptic papers published by 
him was great. Of special importance 
among his earliest papers are those on 
the pselaphidae; on the classification 
of the longicorn coleoptera, and of the 
carabidae ; on the elater¢dae and on the 
melolonthidae. In 1861 his **Classifica- 
tion of the coleoptera of North Amer- 
ica,” prepared for the Smithsonian in- 
stitution, began to appear. This work, 
though left incomplete until recently, 
was indispensible to every student of 
systematic coleopterology, and _neces- 
sitated the publication of the ‘*New 
species of North American coleoptera” 
and the ‘‘List of the coleoptera of North 
America,” both issued by the Smithso- 
nian institution. 

His entomological writing was inter- 
rupted during the civil war, but was 
resumed again in 1865. From this time 
on he had the coéperation of Dr. George 
Henry Horn, who, from the beginning 
of his entomological career, was a faith- 


ful co-laborer with LeConte. Indeed the

friendship and codperation that always 
existed between these two specialists is 
one of the most pleasing and instructive 
incidents in the history of American 
entomology. LeConte must have felt 
proud of the excellent work done by the 
younger naturalist, and the manner in 
which Horn’s more advanced views and 
often more thorough labors— made pos- 
knowledge and 


sible by accumulated 
material— were accepted, even where 
they undid much of his previous descrip- 
tive work, was one of the truest marks 

The 
later period 


of greatness in LeConte. most 
important papers of this 
are those on the classification of the 
rhynchophorous coleoptera, and more 
especially ‘** The rhyzchophora of Amer- 
ica north of Mexico,” by John L. Le- 
Conte, assisted by George H. Horn, 
published in 1876 as vol. 15 of the Pro- 
ceedings of the American philosophical 
society: a work which involved years 
of patient research and the value of 
which has not yet been fully recognized 
abroad. The last important work is the 
second and completed **Classification of 
the coleoptera of North America,” by 
LeConte and Horn, | 

The list of Dr. LeConte’s entomolo- 
gical writings has been carefully com- 
piled (up to 1878) by Mr. George Dim- 
mock, in his Special biblography, no. 1, 
and the actual amount of his descriptive 
work is well illustrated in Mr. Samuel 
Henshaw’s ‘‘Index to the coleoptera 
described by J. L. LeConte, M. D.” 
An additional paper by LeConte, to be 
published in the Transactions of the 
American entomological society, was 
about to be published at the time of his

death, so that he may virtually be said 
to have died in harness. 

This brief reference to his published 
papers reflects but feebly the character 
and value of LeConte’s life and work. 
Throughout his writings there is the 
evidence of a calm, dispassionate, well- 
balanced and philosophic mind, which, 
added to their accuracy, made him from 
an early day the leading authority on 
North American beetles the world over. 
Beginning when the idea of fixity of 
specific type was general, he easily fol- 
lowed the advance of evolutionary ideas, 
conforming his later work thereto, ac- 
quiescing and assisting in the ‘‘sinking” 
of his early species founded on too tri- 
fling variations. 

His non-entomological writings evince 
culture, breadth of view and that rarest 
of qualities in specialists, common sense. 
He was not of the class who decry the 
practical application of knowledge as 
ignoble, but he felt rather that such ap- 
plication to man’s wants is one of the 
aims of science. Thus he was always 
interested in the economic bearings of 
his favorite study and made several 
most valuable suggestions in his ‘+Hints 
for the promotion of economic entomo- 
logy in the United States” 
“Methods of subduing insects injurious 


and his

gical club of that association, he took 
an active part in the attempt to bring 
about uniformity of terminology and the 
adoption of some general rules of no- 
menclature. Ele prepared, in conjunc- 
tion with the writer, a memorial which 
in 1875 was signed by many members 
of the association praying Congress for 
the creation of a special entomological 
commission on a plan that would have 
been in many respects preferable to that 
upon which the United States entomo- 
logical commission was finally created 
in 1877.

occurs to us where he gave expression 
to ruffled feeling is in the ‘tSynopsis of 
the coleopterous insects of the group 
clertdae which inhabit the United 
States” (Annals lyceum nat. hist. N.Y., 
April 1849, v. 5, p 9-35). Im the 
prelude to this paper he indulges in 
some severe reflections on the exclusive 
attitude of the Latin or South European 
countries toward the scientists of other 
countries. more particularly as exem-

not altogether unwarranted even at the

GILLS OF INSECT-LARVAE. 


BY GEORGE MACLOSKIE, PRINCETON, N. J- 


The gills of aquatic larvae of insects 
consist of elastic sacs arising as out- 
growths of the epidermis and enclosing 
a system of fine branches from the air- 
tubes or tracheae, being thus pneumatic 
branchiae. They vary greatly in the 
number of the sacs, in the number and 
complexity of the enclosed air-tubes, 
In the e/midae 
they are simple and

(of coleoptera) 
are distributed ventrally on the abdo- 
men; in Hphemera (of neuroptera) they 
are also simple, and extend from the 
sides of the abdomen; sometimes they

come complex, having in some cases 
many sac-like lamellae, and many hun- 
dreds of branches in each, the whole 
structure - planted within the rectum, 
from the walls of which the lamellar 


sacs open like so many pockets. 


These structures have been described 
by Réaumur, Léon Dufour, Audouin, 
Oustalet, and many others. Our pres- 
ent purpose is to rectify an error in 
their anatomy, as usually represented, 
which has important bearings on other 
questions. 

It is usual to describe the laminae of 
the pneumatic gills as containing sys- 
tems of fine tracheal loops, somewhat 
after the pattern of a plurality of carbon-

culation of air in the tracheal tubules 
like the capillary circulation of blood 
in the gills of fishes. 

Chun? correctly shows that the rectal 
branchiae of Z7del/ula ave outgrowths 
of the [hind] intestine, having at their 
extremity no epithelial cells, but only 
the intima (or cuticle) enclosing the 
tracheal filaments. The epithelium 
gradually grows thinner from the base 
towards the extremity of the branchial 
laminae, and at length disappears, being 
afterwards represented only by the cuti- 
cle. The

caecally; all were of about the same

at all swollen, but rounded off. Thus

form a brush like the hairs of a horse’s

As they are elastic and the enclos- 


probable that with each water-inspira- 
tion the sacs enlarge and the tracheal 
spray (having air forced in by the 
forward compression of the large tra- 
cheae) spreads out so as to bring the 
full tide of air close to the tide of water. 
Léon Dufour seems to have had some 
process like this in view when he said 
that each lamella of the branchia of 
Potamophilus is 
during life by air transmitted by endos-

‘probably swollen 


mos As we understand the case, the 


air is injected into the branchiae from the 
rest of the body by rhythmical contrac- 
tions, and its gases then communicate 
endosmotically with those in the tidal 
water, so as to secure renovation. 

The paper by N. and E. Joly on the 
larva of Prosopiéstoma® confirms our 
observation. This larva was supposed 
by Latreille. Duméril and Milne-Ed- 
wards to be a branchiopod crustacean, 
and is so described in Milne-Edwards’ 
Flistotre des crustacés (Vv. 3, p- 558): 
But MM. Joly found out that it was 
the larva of a coleopterous insect,* and 
they figure and describe its external

branches of the tracheae end caecally. 
In this case the branches are so few that 
their terminations can be easily made

of air from one system to the other. It 
is not easy, in the living insect, to 
determine the ebb and flow directly ; 
as the movements occur suddenly, have 
their speed multiplied by the degree of 
microscopic amplification; and hence 
we are able only to see the rhythmical 
peristaltic action, and are left to guess 
at its cause. We find, however. the 
muscular contractions and expansions 
of other parts of the body synchroniz- 
ing with the pulsations in the gills, and 
thus explaining how the flux and reflux, 
rather than a mere circulation of the 
air, is the cause of its renewal.

THE SCREW-WORM FLY, COMPSOMIIA MACELLARIA. 


BY SAMUEL 


In connection with Professor Snow’s 
article on this fly ? it seems worth while 
to give a brief synopsis of papers pub- 
lished in the past few years by the able 
dipterologist of South America, Dr. E. 
L. Arribdlzaga, of Buenos Aires. From 
his studies he has ascertained no less than 
twenty-six different specific names that 
this fly had received! It is possible 
that some of these names would apply to 
distinct species were their types exam- 
ined, but it is a thankless task to endeav- 
or to make order out of the chaos in 
which Walker, Macquart, and Robi- 
neau-Desvoidy have involved the subject, 
and the result of Arribdlzaga’s thorough 
studies can with propriety be adopted.

To these results, however, Mr. J. Bigot, 
of Paris, has recently taken exception, 
in a note* on Professor Snow’s paper. 
This author’s penchant for making syn- 
onyms himself may perhaps have 
something to do with his wishing to 
preserve species founded on inade- 
quate grounds. His argument that ‘*il

author himself should know that other 
American flies do have a similar range 
of habitat, to say nothing of the nearly 
allied Musca domestica.

The species may, with toler- 


ingabright metallic green or coppery 
color on the abdomen and thorax, the 
latter above with three black stripes ; 
the bristle of the antennae feathered to 
the tip, and the head, except the eyes, 
chiefly yellow. In size it varies from 
seven to ten millimetres. 

However, these systematic details will 
be of less interest than the following, 


which I translate from the Spanish of 


Arribalzaga’ : 

‘During the pleasant days of spring 
or the hotter ones of summer, these flies 
may be seen covering in great numbers, 
now umbelliferous flowers, now all sorts 
of filth ; or, resting, there glistens in the 
sunlight the iridescent surface of their 
half-opened wings, and the blue, the 
green, the violet, the copper and the 
gold of their metallic colored bodies.” 

‘Our fly deposits its eggs, commonly 
called ‘gweresa,’ in dead bodies, in 
manure, in fresh meat reserved for food, 
and soon there appear immense num- 
bers of voracious larvae that rapidly 
consume the objects in which hasbegun 


their active life. Not content with these 


habits, common to all the species of

the group to which it pertains, it de- 
posits the germs of its posterity in the 
wounds of men and of animals, at the 
entrance of openings of the human face, 
and, in its anxiety for propagation, will 
deposit them in the wool of sheep.” 
‘‘Azara was, I believe, the first ob- 
server who noted cases of human my- 
iasisin South America. Coquerel, many 
years later, called the attention of phy- 
sicians and naturalists to the frequent 
and fatal accidents which this evil pro- 
duces among the exiles of Cayenne: 
according to this author, Dr. Chapuis, 
physician-in-chief of the French marine, 
attended one case in which the larvae 
of C. macellartéa had penetrated to the 
frontal sinuses, causing the death of the 
patient; also one very unclean person 
and the 
pharynx, who succumbed after he had 


attacked in the nasal fossae 
ejected one hundred and twenty larvae. 
There were, as M. St. Pair observed, 
in the same country, six similar cases, 
of which three terminated in the death 
of the patients after cruel sufferings: in 
two the nose was destroyed, and in the 
last there was a deformation of the ol- 
factory organ. In another case observ- 
ed by M. St. Pair there were removed, 
by means 
three 


of injections, more than 


hundred larvae, but he was 
not able to obtain them all, and the re- 
mainder soon penetrated the ball of the 
eye, destroying the lower eyelid in 
consequence of gangrene, invaded the 
mouth, corroded the gums and laid bare 
the inferior maxillary ; the victim died 
seventeen days after his entrance into 
the hospital.” 


114 


After giving records of numerous 
other cases he further adds: 

“To Dr. Lesbini, of Cérdoba, are due 
the better observations upon cases of 
myiasis produced by C. macellaréa. 
The first case presented itself in an old 
foreigner who had an ulcer in his leg 
filled with these larvae; the second case 
occurred in Cérdoba, in a boy of seven 
years, attacked in the left ear; the third 
and last case was in a girl of sixteen 
years, also of Cérdoba, affected in the 
nasal fossae by the presence of two hun- 
dred and fifty larvae: all these patients 
were saved.” 

‘It is probable that, attracted by the 
fetid odor of unclean individuals, these 


flies hover over the mouth or the nose,

TOWNEND GLOVER. 


Born Aug. 1812, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
Died 7 Sept. 1883, in Baltimore, Maryland. 


Among the recent deaths of naturalists 
we have now to chronicle that of Professor 
Townend Glover, which occurred in Balti- 
more, Maryland, 7 September 1883, at the 
residence of adopted daughter, Mrs. 
Daniel Hopper. 


his 


Prof. Glover was born of English parents, 
at Rio de Janeiro, on the 11th (or 12th) of 
August 1812, and consequently at the time of 
his death was in his seventy-second year. He 
received his early education in England, 
completing his studies in Germany, after 
which his roving disposition brought him to 
North America, where, for a time, his horse, 
his rod or gun were almost constant compan- 
ions. After marriage he settled at Fishkill- 
on-the-Hudson, devoting himself to amateur 
gardening and horticulture, and it was here 
that his tastes for entomology were develop- 
ed. About 1853 he became connected with 
the Bureau of agriculture, then a division of 
the United States Patent office, spending sev- 
eral years in the south,—at one time visit-

ing Demerara for the purchase of sugar-cane 
for government experiment, — studying the 
habits of the cotton and orange insects, of 
which little had then been written, besides 
employing his time in other ways. The re- 
sults of these investigations, as published in 
the reports of the Patent office from 1854 to 
1858, are already well known to entomo- 
logists. Just prior to the war, Mr. Glover 
accepted a professorship in the Maryland 
agricultural college, where his great work 
on entomology was begun, he having pre- 
viously learned engraving of Mr. Gavitt, of 
Albany, with this object in view. Upon the 
formation of the. present United States De- 
partment of agriculture, he was appointed its 
first entomologist, which position he held 
until the spring of 1878, when ill-health com- 
pelled him to rest from his labors. 

An observer contemporaneous with Harris, 
his first writings appeared in the Cadt;vator 
and similar journals of the time, though the 
great mass of his notes of investigation and 
observation were never given to the world, 
but remained locked in his work on American 
entomology, which he had hoped to complete 
and publish in his life-time. His ‘‘work” 
was his dream, and here for years he accumu- 
lated a mass of interesting facts, the publica- 
tion of which, as discovered, would have 
made his name as an observer great indeed. 
Some of these facts have been given to the 
world in his published reports as United 
States entomologist, but the majority were 
withheld from publication, —awaiting the 
completion of his work — until, from time to 
time, many of his interesting discoveries 
were re-discovered and published by the 
army of careful observers who have come 
after him,and the credit has thereby been 
lost to him. Perhaps it was his over consci- 
entiousness which kept him from ‘‘rushing 
into print,” for he often underrated his own 
judgment in citing the histories of insects 
he had carefully reared and observed, rather 
preferring to give the experience of another 
with full credit, than to use his own material. 


116 


Susceptible to the world’s praise, he shrank 
from its censure, which alone may be given 
as areason for his never having named a 
species, or, to use his own words, helped to 
mix up the nomenclature. 

Of his labors only those who were inti- 
mately associated with him will ever know 
how untiring and persistent—even methodi- 
cally so—were his efforts. For years, all the 
available moments of daylight, ‘‘out of office 
hours,” were given to engraving the copper 
plates; the evenings were devoted to writing, 
while into that uncertain limit ’twixt bed- 
time and the time for blowing out the candle, 
were crowded all his mental recreation, 
reviewing of new books, reading the maga- 
zines and the Herald, or, sometimes, even a 
popular novel. 

Whether his work will ever be given to the 
world or not, in its entirety—despite the 
efforts of some to belittle it—itis simply a 
colossal encyclopaedia of American entomol- 
ogy. comprising names, derivations from the 
Latin or Greek, and synonyms of thousands 
of species of insects, with histories, food- 
plants, remedies, habitat, etc’., a library in 
itself, complete in detail, and comprehensive 
in inception to a wonderful degree. It is 
now in the possession of the United States 
government, and its great size will doubtless 
be the chief obstacle in the way of its publi- 


cation.

CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB. 


13 Aprit 1883.—The 92nd meeting of the 
Club was held at 19 Brattle Square, Cam- 
bridge, 13 April 1883. In the absence of the 
President, Mr. Hayward was chosen Chair- 
man. Five members were present. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder showed a collection of 
colored figures of North American coleo- 
ptera, hymenoptera and diptera, drawn by 
Maj. LeConte, and now belonging to Dr. J. 
L. LeConte. 

Mr. G. Dimmock read a paper on ‘*The 
cocoons of Cronus scrophulartae.” The co- 
coons of this European species of curculions- 
dae imitate the fruit of Scrophularia nodosa. 
A sprig of Scrophularia, with cocoons of 
Cronus upon it, was shown. [The paper will 
appear in Psyche, v. 3. ] 

Mr. S. H. Scudder called attention to B. N. 
Peach’s paper, entitled, ‘‘On fossil 
myriapods from the lower old red sandstone 
of Forfarshire’ (Proc. Roy. phys. soc. 
[Edinb.], 1881-1882, p. 177-188, pl. 2) in 
which two fossil myriapods from the devonian 
of Scotland are described. These two myria- 
pods (Kampecaris forfarensis and Archides- 


some 


mus macnicol/) are probably the oldest insects 
known.

shall command respect from any journal in

which we will now omit. 


Ar a recent meeting of the French ento- 
mological society, Dr- Laboulbéne instanced 
a case in which dipterous larvae had been 
vomited by a woman thirty-nine years old, 
under the care of Dr. E. Pichat of La Rochelle. 
Specimens of the pupa, and of the fly hatched 
from them (Curtoneura stabulans Fall.), 
were exhibited to the society. The woman 
had been troubled for some days with bron- 
chitis and very fetid breath, and finally, after 
a severe attack of coughing, vomited twice. 
Dr. Pichat afterward found in the basin used 
a hundred to a hundred and fifty of these 
larvae; and the cfrcumstances as related by 
him leave no serious doubt of their source, 
though he was not present during the yomit- 
ing, but only called immediately after it.

This larva, according 
well known, and is ordinarily 
composing animal and vegetable matter, in 
mushrooms, etc., and has also been reared 
from caterpillars and hymenopterous larvae. 

The possibility of the existence of such flies 
(muscariae ) in the human body was formerly 
generally accepted, but has lately been denied 
by Davaine. Experiments have proved, says 
Dr. Laboulbene, that such larvae, introduced 
into the stomach of animals by a fistula, have 
been discharged alive in the excrement, one, 
two, or even three days later. -— Sczence, 23

extracted from an abstract given in the 
Deutsch-amerikanische apotheker-zettung, I 
Apr. 1883, jahre. 4; P- 49, of a paper by T. 
Bogomolow, published in the S¢. Petersburg 
med. wochenschrift: 

Bogomolow first introduced this medicine 
into practice in 1876. In the course of the 
last six years it has been used successfully 
for dropsy by several physicians, while others 
have had negative results. Favorable action 
resulted in 47 per cent. of cases published 
heretofore. Bogomolow mentions 7o addi- 
tional cases, in 29 of which the medicine was 
administered in powdered fo91, and in fl as 
tincture. In Ig cases the author brought 
about profuse perspiration, in 61 cases clear 
urination, and in I3 cases 
crease of intestinal evacuation (by stronger 
transudation through the intestinal walls). 
He had in no case seen Symptoms of irritation 
or other inconvenient accessory action. The 
tincture was prepared by soaking well-dried 
sand pulverized cockroaches in six times their 
weight of 95 per cent. alchohol for two or 
three days in a warm place. Of this tincture 
the author prescribes for adults a tablespoon- 
ful thrice daily, for children twenty drops 
thrice daily. The powder is to be used only 
incase of emergency, and spoils easily by 
exposure,

ON THE LIFE-HISTORIES AND IMMATURE 


STAGES OF THREE 


EHUMOLPINI. 


BY STEPHEN 


ALFRED FORBES, 


NORMAL, ILLINOIS. 


[ With Plate r.| 


The three species to which this paper 
Fab., 
Paria aterrima Oliv., and Scelodenta 


is devoted (Coluspis brunnea 


pubescens Mels.), live underground in 
the larval stage, and feed upon the roots 
of the strawberry (/rragarza vesca L.). 
The larvae of all three 
in the same localities and situations ; 


often occur 
they are extremely similar in general 
appearance, two of them (/Paréa and 
Scelodonta) being, indeed, almost in- 
distinguishable ; and their food-plants 
and food-habits are identical. They have 
consequently not been discriminated 
heretofore, even where they have been 
collected in considerable numbers and 
studied with some care; and_ their 
life-histories, as far as made out, have 
very naturally fallen into some confu- 
sion. 

The following account is based upon 
almost continuous observation of one of 
the species, upon breeding experiments 
with all three, and upon numerous col- 
lections of all, made from August 1882 
to December 1883, mostly in southern 
Tlinois, 


strawberry fields.

Literature. 
The first undoubted reference to an 
immature stage of this beetle, which I 
have found, is in the 3rd report of the 


state entomologist of Missouri (C. V. 


Riley), for 1871, p. 81-84, in which the 
larva is described and figured, and record 
is made of the fact that it feeds upon

but in terms to show that it was not at 
that time distinguished from the larva 
of. Scelodonta. 

In his report as state entomologist for 
the following year, p. 34, Mr. Riley 
again described this larva from numer- 
ous specimens, and figured the dorsal 
and ventral aspects of the head, a sepa- 
rate mandible, and one of the ventral 
segments. The description given of the 
mandible and of the anal segments, and 
the figure of the former, do not apply 
exactly to the larva of Colaspzs, and it 
is possible that the specimens upon 
which this second description was based 
belonged to one of the other species. 

In the American entomologist for 
1880, v. 3, p- 243, Mr. Riley repeats 
his original figures of the Co/asp7s larva ; 
and this form has since been mentioned 
frequently in various economic publica- 
tions, but without any further additions 
to our knowledge, either of its characters 
or of its history. The pupa has remain- 
ed hitherto unknown.

but each of the remaining eleven seg-

three transverse dorsal folds, which ter- 
minate on the sides in large, low eleva-

ends being upwards), one to each seg-

fleshy tubercles which project down-

lengths, the three or four longest of

others on the larva. The hairs on the 
ventral ridges between these tubercles 
form an unbroken row. They are about 
nine in number, alternately longer and 
shorter, with very many short ones inter- 
mingled; the longest being about as 
long as the corresponding segments. 
The twelfth ventral segment (fig. 7E) 
is deeply and widely emarginate pos- 
teriorly, divided, in fact, into two 
triangular plates, between which the 
unusually developed thirteenth segment 
appears. These lateral plates are fringed 
with spines on the posterior two-thirds 
of their inner margin. The thirteenth 
or anal segment is likewise longitudi- 
nally divided beneath. 

These two segments taken together 
are about one anda half times the length 
of the preceding one; and their dorsal 
arches are likewise relatively elongate, 
being scarcely, if at all, shorter than 
the next segment in advance. 

The legs are about as long as the tho- 
racic segments to which they are at- 
tached. and are white, with the excep- 
tion of the claws, which are dark brown 
at the tips. They are provided with a 
few slender white hairs, which become 
shorter and more spine-like toward the 
end of the leg.

The outer distal angle of the third joint 
is continued as a cylindrical process, 
which reaches to the end of the joint

The mandibles (fig. 7C) are rather 
narrow (the width being about two- 
thirds the length), strongly curved, 
comparatively broad, and obtuse at tip, 
where they are emarginate, or some- 
times trifid. Each bears two long, slen- 
der hairs at its outer base. 

The cardinal and basal pieces of the 
maxilla (fig. 7Bc) are not clearly dis- 
tinct; the maxillary lobe is stout, round- 
ed at the tip, and convex internally, 
with about ten spines, of varying 
strength, along the inner margin, the 
‘two basal ones being very strong, and 
about half the length of the lobe. This 
last extends only a little beyond the

Life- History. 

The imago is said by Dr. Fitch to 
appear in the latter part of June, con- 
tinuing through the month of July. Mr. 
Riley, in his third Missouri report, says 
that pupation commences in June, the 
beetles appearing in that month and con- 
tinuing to issue from the ground until fall 

Larvae of this species were first seen 
by me in southern Illinois on 19 May, at 
which time they were about half-grown. 
On 28 June, full-grown larvae and ima- 
gos were found in the earth, in straw- 
fields, the

Adults again 
occurred in the earth on g July, but by 


18 July all had emerged. As early as

4 July they appeared in stubble fields, 
and were found from the beginning in 
sweeping the leaves of the strawberry, 
where they continued common until 1 
August. They were also taken in vine- 
yards, feeding upon the leaves of grapes, 
on ir July. 

Careful and repeated search in all 
situations suited to their development 
failed to discover either larvae or pupae 
again during the year; and I have no 
doubt that the species is single-brooded, 
and think that it completes its trans- 
formations, under ordinary circumstan- 
ces, by 1 August. 

Numerous collections made in Octo- 
ber, November and December, through- 
out the region where these beetles ap- 
peared abundantly earlier in the year, 
failed to discover a single specimen 
among the thousands of hibernating in- 
sects encountered; and I am of the 
that 
rarely, if ever, as an imago, but believe 


opinion this species hibernates 
that it deposits its eggs in late summer or 
autumn. probably in the earth about 


strawberry roots.

Prof. Cook’s article, ina revised form, 
was also published by the State agri- 
cultural society of Michigan, in its re- 
port for the year ending August 31st,

its habits, was given by the present wri- 
ter in the Transactions of the State hor- 
ticultural society of Illinois, for 1882, 
p- 199, and again, in the following year,

form, and general appearance with the 
larva of Colaspis, this species may be

stouter than those preceding ; and those 
of the dorsal surfaces of these segments 
are likewise more numerous. The dor- 


sal arches of the last two abdominal 
rings are broken into four prominent 
tubercles, which are sometimes slightly 
blackened, and bear especially strong 
spinous hairs. 

The eyes are represented by a small 
cluster of a varying number of pigment 
specks, situated at less than the length 
of the antenna above its base. 

The antennae are three-jointed, very 
short, not twice as long as wide. the 
length of the basal joint being just about 
its width. The cylindrical process of 
the penultimate joint is segmented off, 
forming an apparent accessory article 
beside the terminal one. The cly- 
peus is about as long as the labrum; 
and upon the middle of the upper sur- 
face of the latter are four long hairs, 
arranged transversely ; and at the infe- 
rior edge of the posterior surface are 
eight strong hooks or spines, pro- 
jecting inwards and backwards. The 
maxillary palpi are strong and_ thick, 
the two basal joints being broader than 
long, the third about as lone as wide, 
and the fourth ovate. The tip of the 
third joint extends scarcely beyond the 
end of the blade of the maxilla. The 
latter is not longer than broad, and_is 
armed with about ten stout, blunt spines 


at its inner margin. 


IESIN GIT Be 127 


The general form of the mandibles 
(fig. 6B), seen from above, is triangu- 
lar, the length being scarcely greater 
than the width at their base. The tip, 
seen from beneath, is obtuse and more 
or less conspicuously emarginate, often 
decidedly lobed, in which case the lobes 
are equal. It is never trifid, and never 
acute. Occasionally this bilobate char- 
acter of the mandibles is indicated by a 
longitudinal groove, which scarcely ren- 
ders the tip emarginate. 

The anal segment of this larva is used 
as a proleg, the grub looping along ona 
smooth surface after the manner of a 
phalaenid larva. 

Pupa. The

men, especially the last (fig. 6A). This 
terminates in a pair of brown, chitinous 
hooks, which curve dorsally, instead of 
inwards as in Colasp7s, each being fur- 
nished with a strong, erect tooth or 
spine arising from the upper side of the 
base. From the middle of the concave 
margin of each hook springs a long 
slender hair. The spines in front of

the plants. On 20 July, larvae and pu- 
pae of this species were found among the 
strawberry roots, adults also occurring 
on the foliage; and on 26 July all stages 
were sent me from Lansing, Michigan. 

From 1 to ro August, larvae, pupae 
and imagos were collected in southern []- 
linois. On rr August, the larvae and 
pupae were noticeably less common than 
before, but the imagos were now more 
abundant on the leaves, and several were 
taken from cavities in the earth.

Evidently, here we get no glimpse of 
a second brood, either early or late, but 
find the beetles wintering as mature in- 
sects, probably laying their eggs in the 
ground in June, the adults appearing 
again late in July and in August.

that a sprinkling of them hibernate as

was clear, not only from the great num-

from the fact that adults of Parda ater-

careful search of previously infested 
fields, made late in July and early in 
August, yielded but a single imago of 
this species. 

Adults emerging in the breeding cages 
were observed to feed freely upon the 
leaves of the strawberry, making small, 
round holes though the leaf, of about 
the diameter of their own bodies. 

The above data enable us to say defin- 
itely that this insect is single-brooded, 
like its congeners; that it hibernates as 
a full-grown larva, in oval cells in the 
earth, a few beetles of the preceding 
brood likewise sometimes surviving the 
winter; that the change to pupa occurs 
in May ; and that the adults appear above 
ground in June. In July, doubtless, 
the eggs are laid, probably in the ground, 
the young larvae attacking the roots of 
the strawberry in that month and in 


August. 


Comparison of Life-fistortes. 


It will now be interesting and profit- 
able to bring together. side by side, the 
life-histories of these three companion 
species. 

We have, in these root-worms, three 
related species, attacking the same part 
of the same plant in precisely the same 
way, at the same stage in their develop- 
ment; and strictly dependent upon this 
plant (as far as is known) for their con- 
tinued existence. They are, moreover, 
all native to the region in which they 
now occur, and have probably fed upon 


130 


the wild strawberry from time imme- 
morial. 
One would say that here were all the 


conditions of a most determined struggle 


for existence, in which one or more of 


these species must succumb. It is in- 
deed interesting to see how the issue 
is evaded, and anadjustment reached by 
which competition is reduced to a mini- 
mum. The Col/aspzs larva makes the

of that month. Next comes Parza, in 


July and August, neither extreme of

observations; and finally comes Sce/o-

donta \arva is left in undisturbed pos- 
session during the remainder of the 
year; although there is a break in our 
observations for October. Certainly by 
November it has completed its work, 
and retired, full-grown, and ready to 
transform, into its subterranean cell. 

It seems clear, furthermore, that this

COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF DIPTERA. 


BY SAMUEL WENDELL WILLISTON, 


From dearly purchased experience I 
have learned the necessity of care in 
the collection and preservation of ento- 
mological specimens. and it may be

that a few hints will be of service to 
the collectors of diptera and similar 
insects. 

For collecting I use a cyanide-bottle,

specimens collected in such are worth- 
less for scientific or other purposes. I 
select several two ounce [60 c. c. |, wide- 
mouthed bottles of the same form, and 
carefully line the bottom and sides with a 
good quality of blotting-paper. Good, 
firm corks are selected, which are inter- 
changeable in the different bottles: in 
one of these corks a small hole is made, 
in which it is better to fit a small metal- 
lic ferule; a strip of blotting-paper is 
then coiled within this cavity, and it is 
over this that a few drops of a solution

and a vial of chloroform in the pocket. 
By thrusting the end of the net, with its 
contents, for a few seconds into the 
chloroform bottle, one can then remove 
the specimens undisturbed. Very mi- 
nute flies it is expedient to preserve 
alive in small bottles filled with paper 
clippings and through the cork of 


which a small glass tube is’ thrust 


nearly to the bottom. For a collecting 
net, after many experiments and _ fail- 
ures, | have found most serviceable a 
simple, rather light, brass wire, soldered 
together to form a ring about 2S cm. in 
diameter and firmly attached to a light 
handle about one metre long. The net 
is made of very coarse bobbinet lace, 
the end, 


the most serviceable and, in 


cheapest material. © The net should be 
readily handled with one hand. 

For the collection of diptera a few 
hints here will sufice. The best sea- 
Son in New England is June, yet speci- 
mens be collected month

of June, beating will give excellent 
results. A little later, patches of black- 
berry (Aaédus), wild cherry (Prezzs), 
Canada thistle 
( Czrstum), or other melliferous blos- 


dogwood (Cornus), 
soms, will afford desirable specimens. 
It is better to let specimens come to the 
collector than to go hastily about look- 
ing for them. Ihave spent six hours 
about a patch of Cornus paniculata 
not ten metres in diameter, and been 
amply repaid. But few specimens are 
found in shady woods; those few are 
to be sought for there. The favorite 


place for ¢abanzdae, as indeed for most

iron pins. They should be placed on 
the pin only low enough so that the 
head may be grasped with the thumb 
and forefinger without danger to the 
specimen. Zhe wings should never 
6e spread. Spreading not only renders 
the specimens more difficult to study, 
but it spoils the natural appearance of 
the insects, and is a positive injury to 
them for the cabinet. - All that is 
necessary is to push aside the wings so 
that they will not conceal the abdomen. 
Minute specimens should be pinned 
with fine iron wire from the underside, 
and then pinned upon small strips of 
thin cork, the upper surface of which 


MusEUM PESTS OF SERVICE TO THE 
ENTOMOLOGIST.— 7rogoderma tarsale 
has heretofore been viewed with un- 
mixed hatred by entomologists, but for 
the last few days I have been showering 
blessings on the heads of a particular 
colony which had established itself in a 
pill-box containing some hundreds of 
specimens of a pteromalid reared from 
the cocoons of Apanteles aletiae Riley. 
It is true that nothing but fragments of 
the pteromalid remained after the Z77o- 
goderma had been at work for a year 
or more, but among these fragments

has been covered with white paper, and 
through the other end of which a pin 
is thrust. Small specimens should 
never be glued to bits of card-board, 
as is commonly done with coleoptera. 
Only one specimen should be placed 
on the piece of cork. 

The greatest enemy to dipterological 
collections is dust: insects can be 
guarded against, but it is difficult to 
exclude dust, unless tight cases are 
used. Dampness and mildew do often 
much mischief. 

A good dipterological specimen must 
be unrubbed, unmoistened, not dusty 
nor greasy, and with the wings un- 
spread. It is quite as easy to collect 
good specimens as poor ones and much 
more satisfactory. 

[For other articles on the collection and 
preservation of diptera, see Rec., 157, 2335: 
3396. 3404 and 3405-] 


I have found a number which illus- 
trate points in the external anatomy 
better than the most careful dissections. 
Certain points concerning the form and 
structure of the . metanotum—always 
hard to study in the complete insect, and 
very difficult to dissect out, owing to a 
disagreeable tendency to break through 
the middle as readily as at a suture— 
are admirably exhibited by these acci- 
dental anatomical preparations. Truly 
it is an ill wind that blows no good.

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 


CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB. 
(Continued from p. 116.) 


11 May 1883.—The 93rd meeting of the 
Club was held at 19 Brattle Square, Cam- 
bridge, 11 May 1883. In the absence of the 
President. Mr. S. H. Scudder was chosen 
Chairman. 


Three members were present. 

The minutes of the last meeting were read 
and approved. The additions to the library 
of the Club were announced by the Secretary. 

Mr. R. Hayward exhibited a specimen of 
Chiaenius tomentosus taken at Milton, Mass., 
which varied strikingly from the common 
form of this insect. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder showed a collection of 
colored figures of insects drawn by Major J. 
E. LeConte. These figures were a continua- 
tion of the collection which was exhibited at 
the last meeting. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder described the habits of 
Myrmecophila and gave a history of speci- 

mens previously mentionedas from America. 
Living specimens of young M. Zergand?. 
taken among ants under bark. at Washing- 
ton, D. C., were shown. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder called attention to the 
eleventh part of W. H. Edwards’ ‘*Butterflies

eggs and larvae of Lemonias nats.

glasses such asare used for microscope slides. 
Thus mounted. and sealed with black lac or 
other means, the specimens can be pinned in 
the collection with safety and neatness. 
Specimens can be mounted in Canada balsam 
in these cork rings, in the way described by 
Cameron (Proc. nat. hist. soc. Glasgow, 18S1- 
1882, v. 5. pt- I. p- 4-7). who used, however, 
paper in place of cork. Cork is lighter than 
paper. is more convenient for pinning. and 
can be cut easily into rings of different sizes 
with a cork-borer such as is used in chemical 
laboratories. If circular cover-glasses are 
used the cells can be sealed neatly on a turn- 
table for preparing microscope slides. Speci- 
mens illustrating several styles of mounting

BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON. 


14 Dec. 1883. —... A paper by Dr. C: V. 
Riley on *‘The use of napthaline [sic] in 
medicine and as an insecticide,” was read for 
Dr. Riley, in his absence. by Dr. W: S. Bar- 
nard. It was in the main abstracted from 
Dr. Ernst Fischer's **Das naphtalin in der 
heilkunde und in der landwirthschaft .. -. 
1883.” Naphthalin [C,)H,] was first made in 
1SoS. Nothing was said by Dr. Riley of its 
use in medicine. Its use as a substitute for 
camphor, for kiliing museum pests, was sug- 
gestedin 1840. Placed in insect boxes, it kills 
acari and psoci, but not other museum pests. 
Experiments were made with it against Phy/- 


loxera vitifoliae in 1872. Fischer began ex- 


134 
perimenting with it in 1881. It is a better in- 
secticide and cheaper in its crude form than 
when pure, but is more injurious to plants in 
that form. It has been applied to grape vines 
by pouring a kilogram of it in a trench from 
15 to 20 cm. deep near the stock of the vine, 
and then filling the trench with earth. 

Dr. T: Taylor said that he had 
mended the use of naphthalin for killing 
phylloxera about ten years ago, and promised 


recom- 


to read a paper on the subject at the next 
meeting of the society. He had not placed 
the substance in the ground. 

Dr. W:S. Barnard said that naphthalin 
might prove valuable as an insecticide, if 
made cheap enough and so applied as not 
to injure the plants. He had 
method and apparatus by which those insect- 
icides which are dangerous to plants, such 
as kerosene, cyanide of potassium [KCN], 
and bisulphide of carbon [CS], might be 
used so as to be safe for the plants and de- 
structive to insects in the ground. These 


devised a 


substances have usually been applied on the 
surface of the ground or buried shallowly, 
either among the roots or above them, but 
when brought in contact with the roots, in 
strength, they kill them. When applied in 
volatile form they are not so injurious. 
Naphthalin and kerosene especially should 
be placed deep below the roots. The appar- 
atus, which Dr. Barnard names a ‘‘nether- 
insertor,” consists of a tube which is made 
to fit closely around a central solid shaft 
somewhat longer than the tube and pointed 
at its lower end. The tube may have an 
internal diameter of 15 mm. and the shaft 
a diameter of 12 mm. The upper end of the 
tube expands like a bowl. The upper por- 
tion of the shaft is weighted with a heavy 
ball so disposed that the shaft can be grasped 
above the ball. By withdrawing this shaft 
partially from the tube and then returning 
it with force, as the lower end of the tube 
rests on the ground, both tube and shaft can 
be driven into the ground to any required 
depth. The shaft is then wholly withdrawn

and the insecticide poured into the tube, by 
which means it is placed beneath the roots 
without coming in contact with them. The 
tube is then withdrawn, and the hole made 
by it filled with earth. The insecticide, being 
volatile, rises through the ground and be- 
comes diffused. With this method of appli- 
cation kerosene is probably superior to naph- 
thalin. 

28 Dec. 1883....—Dr. T: Taylor read a pa- 
per ‘On naphthaline [sic], its effects on seeds, 
plants, insects and other animals,” describing 
the results of experiments made by him in 
1872 and since. He found thatits vapor pro-

ofa flower-pot where the worms occurred. 
Insects infesting seeds were killed by enclos- 
ing the seeds in jars with naphthalin. Seeds 
enclosed with naphthalin for two years after- 
wards germinated, though the odor of the 
naphthalin was as strong at the end of that 
at the Three tender 
plants were kept in an atmosphere of naph- 
thalin vapor for thirty-six hours causing a 
single leaf on two plants to wilt, and not

sufficient to kill the insects on the plants.

The presence of oxygen is indispensable to the actior 
of the luminous apparatus of /ampyrfs. Every agent 
which kills the cells immediately arrests the phosphores- 
cence. This appears to be due to the production by the 
protoplasm under the influence of the will of a phospho- 
rescent substance, probably hydrogen phosphate.

ENTOMOLOGICAL ITEMS. 


BULLETIN No. 3 of the Entomological divi- 
sion of the U. S. Department of agriculture 
was issued § Dec. 1853, and may be obtained 
on application to the U. S. Commissioner 
of agriculture at Washington. 


THE SECRETARY of the Cambridge ento- 
mological club has just published, at his own 
expense, the minutes of the club’s meetings 
held during 1883. A copy has been sent to 
every active member of the club. 


M. Tueopore Goossens has announced 
a memoir to appear in the annals of the 
French entomological society on the eggs of 
lepidoptera. With M. Goossens’ long experi- 
ence in rearing lepidopterous larvae this 
paper will be probably a valuable and inter- 
esting contribution to entomology. 


Mr. W. HaGue HARRINGTON has present- 
eda list of 926 species of coleoptera taken 
about Ottawa, Canada, during the past six 
years, to the Ottawa field-naturalists’ club. 
The list, when published, will contain about 
1050 species, there being some yet awaiting 
determination. 


Dr. H. A. HAGeEN, of Cambridge, Mass.. 
is writing a monograph of the Odonata and 
is desirous of obtaining larvae and pupge of 
these insects, and especially reared specimens 
with notes upon their earlier stages. 


Mr. Henry Epwarps, who started and 
has since edited and published Pafvlro, has 
transferred that paper to Mr. Eugene M. 
Aaron, who requests that all communications 
and business pertaining to Pafgzl/o be ad- 
dressed to him, Lock Box 2500, Philadelphia, 
Pa. 


Pror. BERG describes in a late numero of 
Kosmos, how a spider, Déapontia kochit, 
found in Uruguay, uses funnel-formed webs 
to catch tadpoles for food. In the American 
naturalist for November 1876, T. M. Peters 
relates the mode by which a species of spider 
found in Alabama springs upon and captures 
minnows.

Mr. WILLIAM Jones notes, in Sczence for 
4 Jan. 1884, that he kept a spider alive in a 
box without food or drink for 204 days. 


Lr NATURALISTE CANADIEN, begun Dec. 
1868, has just ceased publication, the final 
numero containing an explanation that the 
withdrawal of an allowance of $400 heretofore 
granted it by the government rendered its 
continued publication impossible. 


Tue Worvp’s industrial and cotton cen- 
tennial exposition, which will open early in 
December 1884, in New Orleans, La., in- 
cludes in its scope exhibits of useful and 
noxious insects, and should not be forgotten 
by enton.ologists. Further particulars can 
be obtained by addressing the director gen- 
eral of the exhibition, Mr. E. A. Burke, at 


New Orleans. 


ANY PERSON who considers himself com- 
petent to transcribe and to translate into En- 
glish with accuracy descriptions of insects 
in dutch, english, french, german, italian, 
and latin, and has access to extensive entom- 
ological libraries, is invited to communicate 
with Mr. B: P. Mann, at the U. S. Department 
of agriculture, Washington, D.C., stating the 
price at which he would be willing to do such 
work.

ernment of the Argentine Republic, by

THE FRIENDS of the late Dr. Hermann 
Miller, of Lippstadt, Germany, have under- 
taken to establish a fund to honor the mem- 
ory of Dr. Miiller and to aid his family. 
The fund will be termed the Muller-fund; 
its revenues will be given to Dr. Miiller’s 
widow during her life-time, and after 


nactonal 


her

death, to some descendant of Dr. Muller who 
may desire to study natural science, or to 
some other needy and worthy student of 
natural science from the school at Lippstadt. 
Contributions may be sent to the treasurer 
of the committee on the Miiller-fund, Wil- 
helm Thurmann, City-treasurer of Lippstadt. 
The undersigned will forward with pleasure, 
to their destination, any sums he may receive 
for the fund, together with the names of the 
givers.

Mr. J. B. SmirH prepares his duplicate 
coleoptera in the following manner :— They 
are soaked for a week or more in a fluid com- 
posed of 100 grams of alum, 25 of salt, 12 of 
saltpeter, 60 of potash and to of white 
arsenic dissolved in 3000 grams of boiling 
water. The is filtered and when 
cold add to every ten parts four of glycerin 


solution 


and one of methyl alcohol. Insects prepared 
in this manner remain soft and flexible and 
can be sent in boxes without being pinned 
and without danger of breaking. The same 
method could be applied to hemiptera and 
orthoptera, but probably it would not be 
successful with diptera, hymenoptera, lepi- 
doptera, or neuroptera. record,

TREATMENT 


BY WILLIAM STEBBINS BARNARD, 


The control or destruction of this noto- 
rious pest is one of the most prominent 
scientific problems of our day. It has 
baffled many experimenters even under 
the stimulus of a standing prize of 300, 
ooo francs offered by the French gov- 
ernment. The Phylloxera commission 
has not yet found a device worthy of the 
award. In its reports (1) bisulphide 
of carbon, (2) sulphocyanide of potas- 
sium and (3) submersion by water, 
are recommended as the best remedies 
it has found. The control of the phyl- 
loxera is becoming a serious question

kerosene, applied by the nether-inser-

tion process, was recommended as su- 
perior to naphthalin. 

Those remarks were in response to 
communications by Prof. C. V. Riley 
and Prof. T. Taylor setting forth the

the cheap, crude article and its lighter 
form, the naphthas, become available 
as most valuable agents against the pests.

The first 
Amer. entomology, 1817, is extremely 


numero of volume 1 of the 


rare; indeed I have never seen another 
copy than mine in Europe or in Amer- 
ica, and was also assured by the best 
authority, Mr. S. H. Scudder, that he 
had never seen acopy. Dr. J. L. Le- 
Conte, in his edition of Say’s works, 
1859, V- 2, p- I, note, says: ‘“’Chese 
references are to the suppressed first edi- 
tion of the American entomology, which 
I have never seen.” Later, in 1872, 
when I showed my copy to the late Doc- 
tor, he answered that he possessed a 
similar copy. Perhaps my memory is 
wrong; at least in the printed catalogue 
of his library it is not mentioned. 

I suppose some details about. this 
rare book may not be out of place. 
Say, in the preface of vol. 1, 1824, p. 
Vii, says: ‘*Six plates of the present

EONDON LETLER. 


East Dutwicn, Lonpon, 
January 5th, 1884. 

One of the most important and extensive 
contributions to a knowledge of the Japanese 
entomological fauna has recently been receiv- 
ed in this country from the hands of Mr. Geo. 
Lewis. This gentleman, having made a no 
inconsiderable collection during a previous 
sojourn in Japan, returned to that country for 
the express purpose of supplementing and in- 
creasing the same, and being an experienced 
British collector was thus enabled to bring 
home a magnificent series of coleoptera, neu- 
roptera and rhynchota. The coleoptera in 
several families have already been treated by 
Messrs. Bates, Gorham and Lewis; the neu- 
roptera have been handled by Baron de Selys- 


148 


Longchamps. and I have given a first report 
on the rhynchota, an order of which some 
Japanese members have previously received 
the efficient attention of your own country- 
man, Mr. P. R. Uhler. We have no state aid 
to entomology in this country, and our suc- 
cess in the study of the science has always 
been largely indebted to the voluntary efforts 
of those votaries who possess the love of en- 
tomology combined with the necessary leisure 
and competence to undertake or promote 
such expeditions. 

Herr Georg Semper, of Altona, who has 
recently paid us a visit, has informed me of 
his intention to publish a work on the rhopa- 
locera of the Philippine Islands, for which he 
possesses good material in the collection 
made by his brother Prof. Carl Semper dur- 
ing his memorable journey to those islands. 
Another work of this nature is in the press, 
viz.. a new edition, with much new matter, 
of Mr. Trimen’s ‘Rhopalocera Africae aus- 
tralis.” 

We are still having a very mild winter, re- 
sembling in this respect its immediate pre- 
decessors. It is probable, therefore, that the 
ensuing summer may also follow its recent pre- 
cursors in exhibiting a considerable dearth in 
insect life, as the complaints of lepidopterists 
and other collectors in our entomological 
magazines during the last few years abundant- 
ly testify. The mild, damp winters are well 
known to be destructive to pupating insect 
life, but these do not explain the more diffi- 
cult and interesting problem as to the sudden 
and plentiful appearance in one season ofa 
generally scarce and almost unobserved spe 
cies. This is not confined to temperate cli- 
mates, as I have lately received a very forcible 
illustration of the 
the tropics. /Ragadia crisia Hiibn., a well 
known and handsome member of the saéyr/- 
nae, is not a scarce insect in the Indo-Mala-

however, the species seems to have been com-

Hill, and sent me as a new species; others 
shortly followed from Province Wellesley, 
with the remark of an experienced collector 
that the species was quite new to the locality; 
and almost simultaneously the Indian mail 
brought me more examples from Sungie, 
Ujong, Malacca and Singapore. 

For some years past, owing to the demands 
of foreign institutions, entomological litera- 
ture has reached a pecuniary value that has 
rendered its acquisition by many students a 
matter of some inconvenience and difficulty. 
At recent sales, held in London, of the books 
of deceased naturalists. these high prices have 
failed to obtain, and we may hope that prices 
may soon be less prohibitory to those work- 
ing entomologists to whom a library of refer- 


ence is a real necessity. 

Mr. Edward Whymper, who paid a visit 
to Ecuador in 1879-1880, where he made a 
considerable collection in natural history, 
especially in regard to entomology, is now 
writing the account of his journey, which 
will shortly be published. A feature of this 
work will be a scientific appendix giving the 
details and identifications of his collection, 
contributed by a body of specialists who have 
undertaken this work. The entomological 
collection is not very large, but its interest 
and biological importance is due to the fact 
that many of the specimens were collected in 
very high altitudes, and thus contrast with 
those found in the hot, tropical valleys. 

In my previous letter (v. 4, p. 94) the name 
“Dr. Leitner” should be spelled ‘*Dr. Leuth- 
ner.”

THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY offers to its stu- 
dents ‘‘final honors” in entomology, as in 
several other subjects, and under the follow- 
ing conditions, which we extract from ‘The 
Cornell university register 1883-84,” p. rrz:— 


Entomology.—The candidate must have 
passed, with an honorable average, the regu- 
lar examinations in the subjects of zodlogy 
(vertebrate and invertebrate), microscopic 
technology, botany (the elementary course, 
including field-work), and entomology (the 
general course, as laid down in the sopho- 
more and junior years in the course in agri-

culture); and must also pass, with distin- 
guished excellence, a special examination 
upon the results of an investigation of one or 
more special subjects to which he has devoted 
an amount of work equivalent to two hours a 
term for two years. 

The subject for 1884 is to be selected from 
the following list: 

(a) The internal anatomy of the larva of 
the Corydalus cornutus Linn. 

(6) The insects injurious to woolen goods 
in the United States. 

(c) The insects infesting apple trees at 
Ithaca. 

(d) The insects injurious to wheat in the 
north-eastern part of the United States.

Many enthusiasts wish practically to pro-

they can do better by increasing the effective- 
ness of established journals than by wasting 
their energies in overcoming the friction of 
numerous new machines, for each separate 
journal requires as much unproductive labor 
in its merely mechanical working as all com-

Tue JANUARY numero of the Deutscher 
brenenfreund contains an interesting article 
on Professor R. Leuckart of Leipzig univer- 
sity, with special reference to his contribu- 
tions to our knowledge of bees. The article, 
which is accompanied by a full-page portrait 
of Prof. Leuckart, was written by Dr. Oskar 
Krancher, lately a student in Leuckart’s 
laboratory. As Leuckart, who is now sixty 
years old, has done much excellent work for 
entomology in the midst of his extensive 
zoological investigations, and has _ been 
the teacher of many young zoologists wno 
have studied the anatomy of insects, I may 
be pardoned for translating a part of what 
Dr. Krancher truly says of the secret of his 
ability as an educator. ‘One needs only to 
be present at a single ‘lecture to discover the 
reason for this extraordinarily large atten- 
Animated diction, eminent gift of 
eloquence, . pleasant, flexible voice, 
knack at experimenting, finally the gift of 
teaching and explaning in the clearest man- 
ner, these faculties combine to make Leukart 
one of the best instructors of Leipzig univer- 
sity.” ‘In his laboratory he proves himself 
the true ‘friend’ of the students, now and 
then taking active hold in the tasks of the 
several workers.” Gam:

ADDRESS OF THE RETIRING PRESIDENT OF 


OF ENTOMOLOGY, 


THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMO- 


LOGICAL CLUB, II JANUARY ISSq. 


Fellow Members of the Cambridge 

Entomological Club :— 

I thank you for the honor you were 
pleased to confer upon mea year ago, 
in electing me to be your president, an 
office which to my regret I could fill 
only in name. I look upon this action 
of yours as a recognition of my interest 
in your work and of my earnest endeav- 
ors to promote it. My absence from your 
meetings has not weakened my devotion 
to the cause which under your auspices 
I have sought, during the last ten years, 
to advance. 

Ten years of the life of the club have 
expired, in which the membership of 
the club has enlarged and grown in in- 
fluence. &lt;A bright future is before us 
if we only strive in unison to carry out 
the purposes for which our club was 
formed, in the most liberal spirit, giving, 
and trusting for the returns. 

IT need not dwell upon retrospect nor 
prophecy. You know the past, and 
you have the future in your own con- 
trol. 

I welcome this opportunity, dictated 
by custom and by your laws, to express 


my thoughts upon that part of our work 
as a club with which I have been most 
concerned. It will not seem to you un- 
natural for me to speak of the Bibliogra- 
phy of entomology, its purposes and 
its methods. I will not go into its 
history, for I prefer rather to consider 
its future. 

We are fortunate in having in our 
midst and reckoning as one of our num- 
ber the prince by excellence of the bib- 
liographers of entomology. We count 
also amongst our members others who 
have rendered efficient service in this 
useful and laborious art. One can hard- 
ly think of the Cambridge entomolog- 
ical club without thinking of PsycHE 
or of Psycue without thinking of its 
Bibliographical record. We are there- 
fore prepared in an especial manner to 
appreciate the importance of bibliogra- 
phical work as applied to the promotion 
of science. 

The need of such work is evidently 
felt in these days more than ever before. 
Since we entered upon our work we 
have seen bibliographical departments 
established as an important feature in 


156 


many periodical publications, and some 
such publications established, as PsycuE 
was, mainly for the sake of their biblio- 
graphical departments.

to the mariner. It is the guiding hand 
which leads him from store to store, 
and places at his disposal all that he 
wants, or points out to him the empty

phy, not so much of any specialty in 
entomology, as of the subject as a 
whole. 

We have many bibliographical pub- 
lications at our service now, for the rec- 
ord of current literature. Such works of 
frequent issue as the Zoolog¢scher anzet- 
ger and the Naturae novitates serve 
an excellent purpose for temporary use. 
By them little of value escapes mention. 
Their form and style are not suited, 
the 
permanent and comprehensive biblio- 
graphy. In their bibliographical de- 
partment they are little more than lists 
of writings, without those references to 


however, to characteristics of a 


reviews, extracts and reprints, which 
serve for the history of literature, and 
which have a more than bibliographical 
value. They are not adapted for ready 
reference by means of indices, and in- 
deed hardly pretend to be more than 
temporary guides to current literature, 
for the especial benefit of those workers 
who are ever tumbling over each other 
in their haste to get at the latest develop- 
ment of science, and to move forward. 
The annual records, such as the Zoo- 
the Zoologischer

less in They too

others. give lists 


descriptions. The bibliography, such 
as it is, is almost buried in the mass of 
the reviews. These works are not so 
much guides to literature as contribu- 
tions to it, themselves requiring guides. 
They treat of the substance of the litera- 
ture more than of its form, and this so 
copiously that in the course of years 


April 1884.] 


they become like forests themselves, the 
trees indeed planted in rows, but those 
of one kind so far apart and interspersed 
with others, that they can only be found 
by a tedious search. 

I do not wish to seem to find fault 
with these works. I recognize their 
value for the purposes of their being. 
I only say of them that they have not 
certain characteristics which they do 
not pretend to have. We have yet to 
find the bibliography that we need, per- 
manent, complete, limited to biblio- 
graphical simplicity and convenient of 
reference. 

For the early literature there is no 
need to

bibliography, upon a simple and_uni- 
form plan, adapted to serve all the 
varied purposes which are to be sought 
in such a work. It may seem superflu- 
ous for me to attempt to describe the 
principles upon which I think such a 
work should be constructed. 

You have granted me so great liberty 
in the editorial management of PsycHE 
that I have been enabled, as improye- 
ments in the form of the bibliographical

record have been suggested, to put them 
into practice. I am largely indebted to 
my principal colaborer in the editorship 
for many of these improvements. Many 
changes have been made and probably 
many others will be made, but the 
essential features have so far remained 
the same throughout. Hagen’s Biblio- 
theca served as a model in the beginning, 
and except in detail little change has 
been made since. 

It is useless in a current bibliography 
to preserve any classification of matter. 
In the early volumes of Psycue the 
attempt was made to bring together the 
whole contents of volumes in a continu- 
ous record, but the disadvantages of the 
plan were found to overbalance its ad- 
vantages. In such a plan the whole 
contents of a volume must be held back 
until the volume is finished, and other 
works which are connected with the 
former by cross-references must be post- 
poned to them. This plan has few ad- 
vantages, moreover, as reference is rare- 
ly made to the contents of works by 
volumes. In later volumes of PsycHE 
little or no attempt has been made at the 
classification of matter. 

The whole problem of  classifica- 
tion is solved by the publication of 
the record in form suitable for the con- 
struction of card catalogs. The only 
feature of the work which is marred by 
the card catalog arrangement is the se- 
quence of the current numeros used for 
the purposes of the index. 

Some persons will choose to arrange 
their card catalogs by subjects, and 


others in chronological order, but I have 


158 


found the most convenient arr ngement 
to be that by authors, alphabetically and 
with titles arranged alphabetically under 
the names of the authors, the index 
being relied on for reference by subjects 
Ma: 
This 


requires, so long as the index is made 


or in any other manner desirable. 


by the use of the current numeros, the 
preservation of a copy of the record in 
its original form. 

During the past three years I have been 
engaged, amidst other duties, in writing 
that bibliography of economic ento- 
mology which was projected by the 
United States entomological commission 
in 1t881,? and was turned over to the 
United States Department of agriculture 
upon the extinction of the commission. 
This I have prepared strictly in accord 
with the methods adopted in Psycue, and 
I have hopes that it may appear so, when 
published. It has been 
index this in large part in advance of its 
publication, and while yet it was in pro- 
cess of formation, so that the current nu- 
metros were not yet attached to it. Under 
these circumstances the reference has 
been made in every case by the citation 


necessary to 


of the name of the author and of the 
title of the article. This method of 
reference, though less compact than the 
mere citation of a numero, has the ad- 
vantage of being universally applicable, 
wherever the title may be found under 
the author’s name. 

The convenience of reference by a 
single series of numeros to the whole 
of the bibliography, however extensive 
it may become, seems to me one of the

most desirable features to be embodied 
in such a work. 

One of the greatest objections to the 
annual records of literature, or to any 
other partial bibliography, from a bib- 
liographical standpoint, is in the neces- 
sity, there present, of consulting many

indices to all the references to a 


single subject. No other form of refer-

under any other circumstances, 

I have now sketched briefly to you a 
few thoughts upon the desirable features 
of a permanent, complete, simple bib- 
liography, convenient of reference. I 
have assumed that the characteristics of 
such a bibliography, are to be found in 
PsycHe. It Biblio-

plan; only the misfortune of its circum- 
stances. However unreasonable it may 
be to hope that these circumstances will 
yet so change, that the record in PsycueE 
may be made complete, I still hope it 
may see better days. If I am not astray 
in my appreciation of it, it will at least 
serve as a model. 

I hope yet to see an index to the liter- 
ature of entomology, which will em- 
body the features I have set forth, or 
better ones. Such a work could well 
be undertaken in connection with the 
work of some scientific station where en- 
tomology is a special feature, and which 
is provided with the necessary means

pride. I would fain see this club the 
author of it.

SEXUAL ATTRACTION IN 


BY ANNA KATHERINA DIMMOCK, 


Late in the summer of 1883 my atten- 
tion was drawn to the sudden appear- 
ance of a large number of holes in the 
garden, which, upon closer observation, 
proved to be the exits of numerous 
beetles of the genus Przonws. Having 
heard that the attraction of the male by 
the female was not common among co- 
leoptera, and finding no notice of such 
attraction in’ the above-mentioned cole- 
optera, I captured a large female which 
was found in the grass with oviposi- 
tor distended and greatly protruded. 
Scarcely had the female been secured 
before a male Przonus appeared; he 
ran and flew, by alternation, meanwhile 
rapidly palpitating his antennae, about 
and around the tent, inside of which the 
female had been confined; finally, dis- 
covering the entrance to the tent, he flew 
in and lit directly on the screen under 
which the female had been put. After 
the appearance of the first male another 
was seen to approach the tent. He 
went through a similar performance to 
that of the first one, finally alighting on 
the cage. In this manner a great many 
male specimens of Proves were taken 
in the course’of an afternoon. On ac- 
count of the presence of so many males

a number of females made their appear- 


ance, showing an attraction of the 
female to the male like that above-noted 
of males attracted by females. Instances 
similar to those just described, that is, 
of male insects attracted by females of 
the same species, have been frequently 
recorded in lepidoptera, especially 
among the domédycédae; but among the 
coleoptera such cases are, I think, more 
rarely met with, the only instance to my 
knowledge being the one ‘originally 
mentioned by Prof. F. H. Snow,? and 
quoted by Mr. J. A. Lintner.? Prof. 
Snow found males of Polyphylla vario- 
Josa vigorously scratching the ground 
above places where females were about 
to emerge, presumably guided to these 
places, as Mr. Lintner suggests, by the

Snow supposed, by that of hearing. 


sense of smell, rather than. 


The most remarkable part of the sex 


ual attraction manifested by Przozzs is 

that of the females being attracted by the 

males, a kind of attraction concerning 

which I have found no notice whatever.

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 
CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB. 
(Continued from p. 147.) 

12 Ocr. 1883.—The 95th meeting of the 
Club was held at 19 Brattle Street, Cam- 
bridge, 12 Oct. 1883. In the absence of the 
President, Mr. S. H. Scudder was chosen 

Chairman. Four persons were present. 

The Secretary announced the reception of 
a box containing a brood of young larve of 
Papilio philenor, in fine condition. The 
Secretary received no clue as to the name of 
the sender, the box having written on it only, 
“* Papilio philenor, Staten Island, June 18th 
1883.” 

Messrs. Hayward, Sprague, and Dimmock 
announced captures of rarer diurnal lepidop- 
tera in Massachusetts. [See Psyche, Sept.— 
Oct. 1883, v. 4, p- 99-100. ] 

Mr. S. H. Scudder made some remarks 
upon fossil species of Raphidia and Lnocellia 
from the Florissant Basin, in Colorado. The 
one species of Raphidia and four species of 
Jnocellia differ structurally from living forms. 
One species of Zzocelléa, not differing struct- 
urally from those found living, has been 
found in amber. 

The Secretary read a letter from Miss 
Eleanor C. Scott, of Flushing, N. Y., who 
inquired in regard to a very small luminous

insect. None of the members present could 
give information about the insect without a 
fuller description than the one sent. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder announced the death of 
Prof. Oswald Heer, of Zurich, Switzerland, 
well known as an author upon fossil insects 
and plants. Mr. Scudder showed a photo- 
graph of Prof. Heer and made some remarks 
upon his works. 

9 Nov. 1883.—The 96th meeting of the 
Club was held at 19 Brattle Street, Cam- 
bridge, 9 Noy. 1883. In the absence of the 
President, Mr. R. Hayward was chosen Chair- 
man. Three members were present. 

Mr. G. Dimmock read a paper ‘‘ On some 
glands which open externally on insects,” 
illustrating the paper with a few specimens 
of insects having such glands. [The paper is 
published in Psyche, v. 3, p- 387-401-] 

Mr. R. Hayward exhibited specimens of 
Bolitotherus bifurcus, and called attention to 
the pubescence on the posterior femora and 
on the horns, and to the length of the carina 
of the head, all secondary sexual characters 
of the male of this species. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder made some remarks on 
G. B. Buckton’s ‘‘Monograph of British 
aphides,” of which the fourth volume has 
just appeared. 

14 Dec. 1883. —The 97th meeting of the 
Club was held at the Secretary’s house, 54 
Sacramento Street, Cambridge, 14 Dec. 1883. 
In the absence of the President, Mr. R. Hay- 
ward was chosen Chairman. Five persons 
were present. 

The Secretary announced the withdrawal 
from the Club of Mr. T. J. Mathews, of Gray- 
ville, Ill., who had written that on account of 
increase in his business he had no time now 
to devote to entomology; also the withdrawal 
of Mr. A. P. Chadbourne, of Cambridge, 
Mass. 5 

Mrs. A. K. Dimmock showed a collection 
representing stages of 38 species of insects 
which are found upon Betula alba, the white 
birch. [An account of this collection will be 
given in Psyche. ]

ENTOMOLOGICAL ITEMS. 


Tue Narurat history society at Spring- 
field, Mass., proposes to begin an insect col- 
lection. 

M. Aprien Do.irus, the editor of the 
Feuille des jeunes naturalistes, at 35, rue 
Pierre-Charron, Paris, France, desires to ex- 
change European ozzscoda for American spe- 
cies. 

Tue JANUARY numero of the American col- 
lege directory, published at St. Louis, Mo., 
contains a portrait of Dr. C: V. Riley, of 
Washington, D. C., with a brief notice of 
his life. 

Tue Dortrus prize of the French entom- 
ological society is awarded, for the year 1883, 
to M. Ernest André, for his work entitled 
“Spéciés des formicides d'Europe et des pays 
limitrophes.” 

Dr. Grasstr has found that flies fed with 
materials which contain eggs of worms leave 
these eggs in their excrement, and that con- 
sequently meat which was exposed to the vis- 
its of the flies could help in distributing para- 
sites. 

In THE November session of the zoolog- 
ical section of the Westfilischer proyincial- 
verein fur wissenschaft und kunst, Mr. Putt 
showed the crop of a pheasant which was 
full of larvae, about 15 millimetres long, 
belonging to some species of diptera. 
There were 411 larvae in the crop. 

Ir 1s announced that the Russian grand- 
duke Nikolai Michailowitsh, eldest son of 
grand-duke Michail, intends to issue in parts 
a fine work under the title ‘‘Mémoires lépi- 
doptérologiques,” the basis for which will be 
his own large collection of lepidoptera, rich 
in species which he collected in the Cau- 
casus. 

WELEARN from the Extomologist’s monthly 
magazine that the Ray society has acquired 
the late Mr. William Buckler’s drawings of 
the larve of British macrolepidoptera, to- 
gether with the voluminous manuscript which 
accompanies them, and they will probably 
form the subject for three or four volumes of 
the society’s publications.

Dr. H. A. HaGEN, in a letter to Scéence for 
11 April 1884, shows that the Hessian fly was 
known by that name in the United States be- 
fore the Revolution. Quotations are given 
from the minutes of the American philosoph- 
ical society of Philadelphia, as early as 18 
May 1768, where the committee on husbandry 
was ‘‘to consider whether any method can be 
fallen upon for preventing the damage done 
to wheat by the Hessian fly.” 


In A brief summary of the European spe- 
cies of lepidoptera with apterous or subapter- 
ous females, by Dr. R. C. R. Jordan, in the 
Entomologist’s monthly magazine for March 
1884, it is shown that wingless lepidoptera 
exist in the following families : heterogynidae, 
arcltidae, hepialidae, psychidae (all species), 
liparidae, noctuidae (one species, Ulochlaena 
hirta), geometridae, pyralidae (part of the 
females of Acentropus nfveus, which oviposit 
under water), toriricidae, tinefdae, and tal- 
aeporidae. 

Dr. Layer, of Bordeaux, has studied an 
eruptive disease to which workers in a large 
vanilla warehouse in that place are subject, 
and found that the disease is caused by a lit- 
tle insect (Acarus) which is found upon the 
outer end of the vanilla capsules. The in- 
sect does not bore into the skin, but causes 
the irritation by contact, aided perhaps by 
the mechanical action of acicular crystals 
which are upon the outside of the capsules. 


THE POISONOUS properties of carbon disul- 
phide [CS,] have been investigated by a 
number of doctors in California. The results 
show that continued breathing of carbon 
disulphide produces derangement. As is 
well known, carbon disulphide has been ex- 
tensively used in the wine-producing districts 
of California against phylloxera, and a num- 
ber of workmen, who were engaged in the 
wine districts, have become insane.—Deutsch- 
amer. apoth.-zettung,15 Feb. 1884, p. 736. 


THE NUMERO of the Extomologtst for March 
1884 contains a note entitled ‘‘Description of 
a Prerés new to science.—Preris spillerz, mi- 
hi. By A.J. Spiller,” in which Mr. Spiller

writes ‘‘As the insect is not in the Cape or 
3ritish museum collections, and is unknown 
to collectors of exotic insects who have ex- 
amined it, and as Dr. Staudinger has pro- 
nounced it to be a new and interesting spe- 
cies, I beg therefore to name it after myself.” 
Mr. Spiller may be ‘congratulated on the 
delicacy of the compliment he has received in 
having the species thus named after him.— 
G: D. 

Mr. J. J. WALKER, writing, in the Exfo- 
mologist’s monthly magazine for March 1884, 
of Pitcairn Island, that curious little inhab- 
ited island in the Pacific near Tahiti, which, 
although only two and a quarter miles long 
by less than one mile wide, rises to a height 
of 1000 feet above the sea, says: ‘‘No butter- 
fly is apparently found on the island, and I 
saw onlya few common Tahitian moths; but 
I found, for the first time, the large yellow- 
striped green larva of Choerocampa erotus on 
the ‘Nono’ plant, and a good many living 
pupe of Sphinx convolvuld (equal in size to 
English specimens) were brought to me, 
having been found in the patches of sweet 
potatoes, of which a supply was then being 
dug up for the ship. Four species of coleo- 
ptera (a Tomicus?, two cossonid weevils, and 
a rhizophagoid ?) occurred rarely.”

PSY CELE. 


ON THE LIFE-HISTORIES AND IMMATURE STAGES OF 
THREE LOUMLOPIN’. CORRECTIVE NOTE. 


BY STEPHEN ALFRED FORBES, NORMAL, 


I regret to have to report a mistaken 
identification of the species of Scelo- 
donta mentioned in my paper ‘*On the 
life-histories immature stages of 
three ezmolpinté (Psycue, Jan.-Feb. 
1884, V, 4, P- 123-130, pl. 1). 

When the imagos appeared in our 
breeding cages last June (see PsycHe, 
v. 4, p- 129), I senta pair of them to 
Dr. J. L. Leconte, with a request that 
he would take the trouble to determine 
them for me; and mentioned at the same 
time the of the 
species. 

In his reply, dated June 24, 1883, 
from Alexandria Bay, N. Y., he says: 


and 


economic relations 


“*T have examined carefully the speci- 
mens of Graphops [ Scelodonta], which 
were safely received just after my ar- 
vival here. I find that they are without 

doubt G. pubescens; that species differs 
from allied ones G. curtépennis and 

G. marcassita, by the more elongate 

form and by the punctuation being ru- 
_ gose only at the sides.” 


With this decision I. of course, rest-

ed content, until this month, when the 
reception of specimens of Scelodonta 
collected from evening primrose ( Oezo- 
thera btennzs), in southern Illinois, in 
the vicinity of strawberry fields, led to 
a review of this determination. It was 
soon evident that these primrose speci- 
mens were of a different species from 
those breeding in strawberries, and had 
also a different life-history, since they 
were taken zz copz/a, in April, at which 
time the strawberry species was abun- 
dant in the earth, in the larval condition, 
not to appear as adult until June. 

As the primrose specimens agreed 
closely with all accessible descriptions 
of S. pabescens, I enclosed to Dr. G. 
H. Horn a specimen of this lot, togeth- 
er with one from the lot bred from 
strawberry root-worms last June, with 
a statement of Dr. Leconte’s previous 
identification of the latter as S. pudes- 
Cens. 

In his reply, received this morning, 
Dr. Horn determines the primrose spec- 
imen as S. pubescens, and that from the 


168 


strawberry as S. zebulosus, saying fur- 
ther: 

‘“The names I now give you are ab- 
solutely typical as far as Leconte’s col- 
health 


was so poor and his eyesight so decep- 


lection goes. Last summer his 
tive that I do not wonder that some of 
his comparisons were erroneous.” 
When we further notice that he was 
separated from his collection when he

wrote me, it need not surprise us that 
for once Jove nodded. 

So far as the paper in PsycneE is con- 
cerned, the errors will be eliminated if 
nebulosus 
reéxamination 


pubescens is changed to 
wherever it occurs, as a 
of all the collections referred to shows 


that they consist of xedulosus only.

PROTECTIVE SECRETIONS OF SPECIES OF ELEODES. 


BY SAMUEL WENDELL WILLISTON, 


In connection with Dr. G ; Dimmock’s 
interesting article? on the glands opening 
externally in certain insects, it may be 
of interest to give some results of sever- 
al years’ observations of certain feredbr?- 
ontdae on the Kansas plains. The 
following species, belonging to the genus 
Ftleodes, viz., F. acuta, E. suturalis, 
Ee. tricostata, E.. obsoleta, FE. extricata, 
E. longicollis, and £. hispilabris, are 
abundant in the regions east of the 
Rocky Mountains, some of them very 
abundant, and with one or two excep- 
tions, they all, when disturbed, eject a 
pungent, vile-smelling liquid. Perhaps 
the most disagreeable of these, in this 
respect, is &amp;. longicollis, a beetle about 
two and a half centimetres long, which 
will eject a stream of fluid from the anal 
glands, sometimes to the distance of ten 
centimetres or more. This liquid has a 
strong, persistent odor, and leaves a

touched, to eject their mephitic secretion.

On the bare plains they are readily seen, 
and I doubt not that they find protection 
from birds, and perhaps from skunks 
also, by means of their secretion.

PROMETHEA. 


BY JOHN GEORGE JACK, CHATEAUGUAY BASIN, P. Q., CANADA. 


For several years I have been very 
much puzzled, in summer, to account 
for numbers of green leaves, some being 
partly eaten, found on the ground be- 
neath trees having long petioled leaves, 
such as maples and poplars, the petioles 
of which apparently had been eaten 
through by some insect. 
while in New Jersey, I noticed similar 
occurrences beneath a sweet gum tree, 
Liquidambar styraciflua, and 
looking for the cause I found that it 


Last summer, 


upon 


was the work of nearly full grown larvae 
of Callosamia promethea, which were 
feeding on the foliage. The petioles 
of Liguidambar leaves are usually 
very long (from 5 to 10 cm.) and quite 
slender. 

To get at the leaves the caterpillar 
was either obliged to abandon 
branch of the tree and crawl out on the 


leafstalk to the leaf, where it would be 


the 


in a very dangerous position, with 
slight foothold, and where it was very 
probable that. owing to the weight of its 
body, it would break off the leaf at the 
node and fall to the ground; or, the 


caterpillar must contrive to bring the 
leaf to itself in some way, while still 
keeping a sure foothold on the branch. 
To do this last required a little skill 
and I found that the *caterpillar was 
equal to the task. Grasping the twig 
firmly with the anal and sometimes one 
or two pairs of the abdominal legs, it 
would extend the remaining portion of 
its body along: the leafstalk, which it 
commenced eating. As as the 
leafstalk was about half eaten through, 
the caterpillar would recede a little and 
eat another place half through or more, 
and sometimes a third place. By this 
time the leafstalk had become so weak- 
ened that the leaf began to droop, and 
the caterpillar, reaching forward again 
as far as possible and grasping the stalk 
beyond the first incision, was able to 
bend it, and, drawing the leaf up to 
itself, eat it without loosing its sure 
foothold on the tree. 

Sometimes the leafstalk was 
through a little too far, or broke off in 
bending, which accounted for the green 


soon 


eaten 


leaves found on the ground.

Mr. G. Dimmogk showed the two halves of 
a split wing of A¢tacus cecrofia, in which 
the two layers of the wing had been sep- 
arated by the following mode. The wing 
from a specimen that had never been dried is 
put first into seventy per cent. alcohol, then 
into absolute alcohol, and from the latter, 
after a few days’ immersion, into turpentine. 
After remaining a day or two in turpentine, 
the specimen is plunged suddenly into hot 
water, when the conversion of the turpentine 
into vapor between the two layers of the 
wings so far separates these layers that they 
can be easily parted and mounted in the 
usual way as microscopical preparations ona 
slide. This is an easy way of demonstrating 
the sac-like nature of the wings of insects. 

Dr. H. A. Hagen showed preparations to 
illustrate organs, of undetermined function, 
found on the larve of gomphidae, libellulidac, 
aeschuidae, but notas yet found on agrionidae, 
which he believes to be traces of segmental 
organs. The organs in question are little 
cavities or invaginations of the epidermis be- 
tween the segments, one on each side of the 
median ventral line, on one, two, or three

to which the larva belongs. Dr. Hagen gave 
a brief notice of these organs in the Zoolog- 
ischer anzeiger, 5 April 1880, jahrg. 3, p-

Mr. G. Dimmock showed a number of mi- 
croscopical preparations to illustrate different 
points of insect anatomy. 

11 JAN. 1884.— The 98th meeting, the tenth 
annual meeting, and the seventh since the in- 
corporation of the Club, was held at the Secre- 
tary’s house, 54 Sacramento St., Cambridge, 
tr Jan. 1884. This meeting terminated the 
first decennial of the Club’s existence, the first 
meeting having been heldg Jan. 1874. In the 
absence of the President, Mr. C. C. Eaton was 
chosen Chairman. Six persons were pres- 
ent. 

The Secretary announced the withdrawal 
from the Club of Mr. Edward Burgess, of 
Boston, Mass. 

The following persons were elected to ac- 
tive membership: Charles C. Beale, of Faulk- 
ner, Mass.; Willard Loomis Devereaux, of 
Clyde, N. Y.; Thaddeus William Harris 

grandson of the well-known entomological 
author who bore the same name), of Cam- 
bridge, Mass.; and John George Jack, of 
Chateauguay Basin, P. Q., Canada. 

The following officers were elected for the 
ensuing year: President, Samuel Hubbard 
Scudder; Secretary, George Dimmock ; Treas- 
urer, Benjamin Pickman Mann; Librarian, 
Clifford Chase Eaton; members at large of 
the Executive Committee, Roland Hayward 
and Thaddeus William Harris. B. P. Mann 
was elected managing editor and G. Dimmock 
associate editor of Psycne for the ensuing 
year. 

The annual reports of the Secretary, of the 
Treasurer, and of the Librarian were read and 
approved. [See further on.] 

The address of the Retiring President, Mr. 
B. P. Mann, upon ‘The bibliography of en- 
tomology” was read by the Secretary. [This

Dr. J. A. OsBorNE writes, in the Extomol- 
Dec. 1883), 
among some observations on Zaraea fascr- 


ogist’s monthly magazine for 
ata. 

‘Last year I was not able to say positively 
in which end of the egg the head of the em- 
bryo develops. As the result of numerous 
observations Iam now in a position to state, 
that the head of the embryo is found in the 


176 


upper and lower pole of the egg with about 
equal frequency. Often we meet with two 
eggs lying together, evidently laid by the 
same fly with the same orientation, in which 
the heads of the embryos lie in opposite 
directions. ‘This is in direct contradiction to 
the dictum of Leuckart: ‘Der obere Pol des 
Eies beherbergt in allen Fallen das Kopfende 
des Thieres’ (Ueber die Micropile, &amp;c., MfZil- 
ler's archiv, 1855, p. 102). Rare exceptions 
to the rule occur also, as I have 
shown, in the eggs of Gastrophysa raphani.” 
The abnormal position of the dorsum and 
venter of the embryo in these eggs is then 
discussed.

A NEw species of trap-door spider, a species 
of Cteniza, has been discovered at San José, 
Cal. The common though little known spe- 
cies of southern California is known as C. 
californica ; and its trap-door nest is usually 
placed in museums beside the tarantula (AZy- 
gale hentzit), and erroneously labelled as the 
tarantula’s nest. This popular error, by 
which dealers in curiosities generally profit, 
is stranger, since the tarantula is usually too 
large to enter the nest of Cfexéza, and itself 
makes no nest, occupying crevices in the 
ground or under stones, spinning a small 
web.—Scvence, 11 April 1884, v. 3, p. 469.

ON THE NERVOUS 


SYSTEM OF THE HEAD OF THE 


LARVA OF CORYDALUS CORNUTUS LINN. 


BY WILLIAM CHRISTOPHER KRAUSS, 


ATTICA, N.Y. 


{ With Plate 2.] 


[Extract from a thesis in entomology, presented to the Faculty of the Cornell university for the 


Baccalaureate in science. | 


The nervous system of the head of the 
larva of Corydalus cormutus Linn., con- 
sists of — 

1. The supra-oesophageal ganglia or 
cerebrum, and nerves. 

2. The crura cerebri. 

3. The sub-oesophageal ganglion or 
cerebellum, and nerves. 

4. The commissures. 

5. The vagus nerve. 

1. THE SUPRA-OESOPHAGEAL GAN- 
GLIA, OR CEREBRUM. — The supra-oes- 
ophageal ganglia (fig. 1. 1) are situated 
in the dorso-cephalad part of the head, 
midway between the tips of the labrum 
and the base of the head. They lie 
dorsad of the oesophagus, and immedi- 
ately entad of the dorsal body wall, be- 
ing separated fromitonly by thin, deli- 
cate layers of adipose tissue. 

The supra-oesophageal ganglia, the 
probable homologs of the vertebrate 


cerebrum, differ greatly from the other 
ganglia or nerve centres of the body. 
They are a compound organ composed 
of two distinct ganglia or hemispheres 
connected together by a short, thick 
commissure on the meson, but are some- 
times described as a single ganglion. 
These hemispheres are similar in out- 
The 
lateral ends of the hemispheres taper 
into the cerebral nerves. 


line, having an ovoid appearance. 
g I 


In the two- 
year-old larva, the cephalo-caudal diam- 
eter of the hemispheres is three-fourths 
of a millimetre, and the two together 
attain the length of two millimetres. 

The ventro-latero-cephalad borders ot 
the cerebrum are developed ventrad, 
forming the crura cerebri, which con- 
nect it with the sub-oesophageal gan- 
glion. 

The cephalad extremity of the aorta is 
attached to the neurilemma, at the cau- 


180 


dad border of the supra-oesophageal 
ganglia on the meson. 
the aorta appears as is shown in the 
plate, fig. 1. 7, the dorsal wall having a 
forked opening near the attachment of

the aorta to the neurilemma. 

The supra-oesophageal ganglia are 
supplied by two large tracheae lying 
parallel to the oesophagus (fig. rv, 4).

These branches divide and sub-divide, 
ramifying to all parts of the hemispheres 
(fig. 1v). The supra-oesophageal gan- 
glia are covered with a thin, delicate 


trachea sends three branches to 


curtain-membrane, the neurilemma. 

The cerebral nerves. — The cerebral 
nerves consist of two trunks of nerves, 
which originate from two tracts at the 
lateral apices of the supra-oesophageal 
ganglia. The cephalad tract gives rise 
to the antennal nerve, and also a small 
integumentary nerve, and may therefore 
be called the antennal tract. The cau- 
dad tract gives rise to the optic nerves, 
and may therefore be called the optic 
tract. 

The antennal nerve. — The antennal 
nerve (fig. 1. 4) arises from the anten- 
nal tract. It extends laterad a distance 
of one and one-half millimetres, and 
divides into a cephalad and a caudad 
branch. 

The cephalad branch (fig. 1. 4. @) 
continues its course laterad, then ceph- 
alad, and enters the antenna, supplying 
it with It is therefore, prob- 
ably, the tactile or sensor nerve of the

inas, the external parts of only six 
ocelli are developed.. The presence of 
the seventh retina and optic nerve can- 
not be doubted, as it was observed in 
many specimens of the one- and two- 
year-old larvae. Fig. vi shows the 
separation of the optic trunk into the 
seven optic nerves. The optic and an- 
tennal nerves are protected by a cover- 
ing, the extension of the neurilemma 
or theca (fig. vi. 3) which covers the 
sub- and supra-oesophageal ganglia and 
nerves. 

2. The crura cerebri. — Vhe crara 
cerebri or the cerebro-cerebellar com- 
missures (fig. Iv. 3 and fig. vir. 2) are 
two cords of nerve matter connecting 
the sub- and supra-oesophageal ganglia, 
and with them encircle the oesophagus. 


June—July 1854. ] 


They arise from the ventro-latero-ce- 
phalad portions of the supra-oesophageal 
ganglia, and extend ventrad, joining the 
sub-oesophageal ganglion at its dorso- 
latero-cephalad borders. They are sim- 
ilar in outline and appearance to the 
commissures of the body.

outline of the oesophagus.

the supra-oesophageal ganglia, each crus 
gives off two nerves, the vagus and the 
clypeo-labral (fig. 1. 2, 3 and fig. rv. 8, 
g). The vagus nerve will be described 
later as a special part of the nervous sys- 
tem of the head. 

The clypeo-labral nerves.—The cly- 
peo-labral nerves, two in number, arise 
one from each crus near its origin (fig

branches in the clypeus, and a fourth, 
long branch which extends cephalad to 
the base of the labrum and penetrates 
‘the integument. After giving off these 
branches, the main trunk extends cepha- 
lad into the labrum and may be termed 
the labral nerve. This labral nerve di-

lies ventrad of the oesophagus, and 

separated from the ventral body-wall by 
a layer of muscles and by adipose tissue. 
The sub-oesophageal ganglion, the prob- 
able homolog of the vertebrate cere- 
bellum, differs somewhat from the other 
ganglia. It is nearly cordate in outline, 
with two apices pointing caudad and 
terminating in the commissures. _ Its 
cephalo-caudal diameter is one and one- 
half millimetres, and its greatest width 
is one millimetre, in the two-year-old 
larva. It is connected to the supra-oes- 
ophageal ganglia by the crura cerebri,

two branches are given off laterad, one 
from each nerve, which divide into sev- 
eral small branches piercing the integu- 
ment. 

At a point two millimetres from the 
ganglion two branches are given off, 
one from each nerve, going cephalo- 
laterad to the integument. 

At a point three millimetres from the 
ganglion the labial nerve separates into 
two large branches, one extending to the 
palpus, and one to the-distal end of the 
ligula. The nerve of the labial palpus 
enters that organ, and near its extrem- 
ity separates into several small branch- 
es. The ligular nerve continues cepha- 
lad into the ligula, and near its extremity 
divides into two or three small branches. 
The nerve of the labial palpus gives off 
a very small nerve at the point of enter- 
ing the palpus. 

The gustatory nerves. —The gusta- 
tory nerves (fig. 1. 2), if they may be 
so called, arise from the cephalad border 
of the sub-oesophageal ganglion, and 
continue their course cephalad into the

cephalo-laterad. The gustatory nerves 
and branches are very fine and delicate, 
and are closely related to the integument 
which forms the walls of the labium and 
ligula. 

The maxillary nerves. — The maxil- 
lary nerves (fig. 1. 5 and fig. m1) arise 
from the ventro-latero-cephalad borders 
of the sub-oesophageal ganglion as a 
single trunk, which immediately divides 
into four branches. These may be in- 
dicated by the letters a, b, c, d, fig. m. 
5, and a, B, ¢C, fig. m1. 

Nerve Aa (fig. 1), which is the 
largest of the branches, forks at a point 
about two millimetres from the gan- 
glion. Both branches enter the max- 
illa, going to its extremity, and one of 
them enters the maxillary palpus. 

Nerve 8. — This branch divides into 
two branches, three millimetres from 
the ganglion, one branch forking im- 
mediately and going cephalad. The 
other branch continues laterad, dividing 
into several branches which pierce the 


integument.

to the maxillary muscles in the head. 
The cephalad branch divides into two 
branches four and one-half millimetres 
from the ganglion, both continuing their 
course cephalad. 

The fourth nerve (fig. 11. 5. @) is a 
very small nerve which divides into two 
branches entering the maxillary muscles. 

The mandibular nerve. — The man-

SEXUAL CHARACTERS IN THE CHRYSALIDS OF GRAPTA

vember-December 1883, v. 4, p- 103- 
106, of the full text of Mr. Lintner’s 
interesting paper on ‘‘A new sexual 
character in the pupae of some lepido- 
ptera,” reminds me of an observation 
which I made last summer on the chrys- 
alids of Grapta tnterrogationis. 

Desirous of obtaining fresh specimens 
of this species, I placed about a dozen 
elm-feeding larvae in a rearing cage, 
from which, in due time, I obtained 
eleven chrysalids. These were, in res- 
pect to color and ornamentation, of two 
distinct sorts. The larger proportion 
were of a dull, pale fuscous with darker 


brown lateral stripes, dots and mark- 
ings, without a trace of metallic orna- 
mentation, while four were much paler 
in general color, inclining to golden 
brown, each ornamented with the eight 
brilliant, pale-golden, papillose dorsal 
spots by which this chrysalis is usually 
characterized. From each of the pale 
and gilded chrysalids emerged a female, 
while the seven dark and unornamented

REVIEW. 


More than two years ago we received, by 
the courtesy of Professor J]: H: Comstock, a 
copy of his ‘(A fragment of a) Guide to 
practical work in elementary entomology” 
[Rec., 3508]. We were then disposed to 
write a critical review of the pamphlet, as re- 
gards its orismology, but did not publish 
it. Weare now favored with a contribution 
from one of Mr. Comstock’s pupils, in which 
this orismology is used. We notice, how- 
ever, two deviations, in this article, from the 
terms recommended by Mr. Comstock, and 
thereby the most serious objections to the 
nomenclature are obviated. These deviations 
are in the use of the adverbial forms cephalad 
and caudad with also an adjectival signifi- 
cance. It seemed to us too absurd for tolera- 
tion to be required by this orismology to 
“speak of the caudal part of the head or of 
the cephalic portion of the tail.” If however, 


we speak of the caudad part of the head and ° 


the cephalad portion of the tail, we only in- 
troduce new words into the language, which 
is always permissible and cannot cause con- 
fusion. Otherwise the introduction of the 
proposed terms cannot cause harm, and may 
do good; indeed, if it is found that in any 
way terms may be introduced which are more 
“brief, simple, exact, significant,” and more 


PSV CHE.

widely applicable than former terms, good is 
certainly accomplished. It is proper to say 
that these terms are adopted by Mr. Com- 
stock from a more comprehensive series pro- 
posed by Professors Wilder and Gage, and 
are not original with him. We have looked 
through the article by Mr. Krauss, to which 
we have referred, with the idea of determining 
the necessity for the new nomenclature. We 
do not find any passage where terms formerly 
in use, such as above, below, before, behind, 
would not be as intelligible as the new terms; 
but, on the other hand, they would not be 
more intelligible except that they are more 
familiar, a difference which disappears with 
use. We do not imagine that any entomolo- 
gist would lay an insect on its back or stand it 
on its head to describe it, using corresponding 
terms descriptive of position, and Mr. Com- 
stock admits that with any system of nomen- 
clature we must first agree what to consider 
the normal position of the parts of an insect: 
that being admitted, the choice is mainly a 
verbal one. The use of the term meson, 
however, and its derivatives, we find to bea 
valuable addition to entomological orismo- 
logy. 

The second chapter of the work is taken up 
with a description of Caloptenus femurru- 
brum, unfortunately called a ‘‘grasshopper,” 
and described as having a ‘caudal leg” and 
“cephalic wings.” The 
locust for this illustrative chapter is borrowed 
from Dr. W. K. Brooks. The description 
is excellent; we it to teachers 
and students, but think older forms of ex- 
pression could be substituted with advan- 


idea of using a 


commend 


tage in a sentence like the following, whose 
peculiar terms are based upon the very nat- 
ural assumption that the locust is standing 
on his legs and holding his head in the 
only position it can then assume without 
being pulled off: — 

“Upon each side joining the pseudo-ventral [lower] 
end of the suture just described and the pseudo-ventral 
[lower] end of the one which extends pseudo-ventrad 
[downwards] from the compound eye is a well marked 
suture, which forms the pseudo-ventral [lower] border 


of the lateral part of the epicranium.”— p. 20.

cepting membership. The Secretary called 
attention to the fund which it is proposed to 
raise in honor of the late Dr. Hermann Miil- 
ler, of Lippstadt, Germany. 

Dr. G. Dimmock called attention to some 
curious habits of Forficula auricularia, a 
specimen of which he had kept in confine- 
ment months. These 
omnivorous, but apparently prefer insects as 
food, eating their own species greedily. Al- 
tho to all appearances blind, except to the 
presence or absence of light, the specimen 
above mentioned captured fleas (Pulex frré- 
fans) with ease in a circular enclosure about 
5 cm. in diameter. No notice was taken of a 
flea put in the enclosure until the flea actual- 
ly touched the forficula, when the latter 
would rush after the flea, palpitating rapidly 
with the antennae, and thus keeping on his 
track. If the flea escaped from beneath the 
antennae of the forficula the latter would 
find him again ina moment, and the amusing 
chase would be renewed, to end in the sure 
seizure of the flea in the mouth-parts of the 
forficula. The forficula was a glutton and 
would often eat a large number of fleas or 
other insects in succession, at the end of his 
repast his abdomen being much distended. 

Mr. S. H. Scudder exhibited a specimen 
and drawings of an arachnid from the coal- 
measures of Arkansas. Two years ago Karsch

Reply to J: W: Douglas’ “Measurements in descrip- 
tive entomology” (of. cft., p. 236-237); the extent to 
which the metric system is now used precludes the pro- 
bability that Paris or English lines will ever become 
general standards of measurement; the use of Paris 
lines by British writers is especially objectionable.

Dr. H: C. McCook has recently described 
the cocoon of a species of spider which he 
calls, provisionally, A%écarza 
The peculiarity of the cocoon consists in its 
being covered with mud, and being suspend-

ENTOMOLOGY HAs just suffered a loss in 
the death, at Copenhagen, early in June, of 
Prof. J. C. Schiddte, a well known entomo- 
logical author. Among other entomologists, 
notices of whose deaths we have seen lately, 
are Mr. Edwin Birchall, lepidopterist, who 
died in Douglass, Isle of Man, on 2 May 
1884, and Mr. William Prest, lepidopterist, 
born 7 May 1824, in York, England, and died 
7 April 1884 in the same town. 


Mr. W: C. Krauss, whose description of 
the nervous system of the head of the larva 
of Corydalus cornutus we publish at this time, 
attained sfectal final honors in the subject of 
insect anatomy at his graduation from the

Dr. Frivz MULLER, under title of ‘‘Butter- 
flies as botanists” notes in Vature for 10 July 
1884 that ‘“‘The caterpillars of Mechanitrs, 
Dircenna, Ceratinia and Ithomia feed on dif- 
ferent species of solanaceae (Solanum, Cypho- 
mandra, Bassovia, Cestrum), those of the 
allied genus Thyridia on Brunfelsia. Now 
this latter genus of plants had been placed 
unanimously among the scrophularineae, till 
quite recently it was transferred by Bentham 
and Hooker to the solanaceae. Thus it ap- 
pears that butterflies had recognized the true 
affinity of Brunfelsia long before botanists 
did so.” Dr. Miller likewise shows that the 
closeathnity of Dalechampiaand Tragia, two 
genera of euphorbtaceae, ‘had been duly 
appreciated by butterflies,” altho only lately 
recognized by botanists.

ation characteristics of a male. The other 
specimen, a Memeophila russula, has the

NOTES ON 


THE RELATIONS OF 


TWO CECIDOMYIANS TO 


FUNGI. 


BY WILLIAM 


For some years, while collecting the 
commoner wedznxeae or rust fungi, my 
attention has been attracted by certain 
small orange-red insects, that are very 
frequent in and about some of the sori. 
They are most often noticed in the aeci- 
dia or cluster-cups and in those sori 
At times 
they are so abundant that it is almost

impossible to collect a specimen of the 
commoner uredo or aecidial forms with- 
out finding numbers of them in nearly 
every sorus. 

A first glance at them suggests that 
the insects may be some species of 
Thrips, but the resemblance vanishes 
on closer cxamination. Their motions. 
as a general thing, are less rapid than 
those of Zkr7ps. and a hand-lens at 
once shows them to be some sort of 
dipterous larvae. With a higher power 
the breast-bone. characteristic of ceci- 
domyid larvae, is distinctly seen. Vari- 
ous attempts have been made to bring 
them to maturity, but so far without 
success, so that it is as yet impossible 
to say anything definite about the spe- 
cies to which they belong. 


TRELEASE, 


MADISON, WISC. 

The constant presence of these insects 
on the fruit of the fungi led me to watch 
their movements from time to time, and 
the reason for their presence was soon 
seen in the altered appearance of the 
sori where they were most numerous. 
Their relish for the Spores is entirely 
disproportionate to the size of their mi- 
The fact that they feed 
on the spores affords a simple explana-

tion of their presence on the aecidial 
and uredo fruits. rather than in the te- 
leutosporic sori of the rusts, since the 
spores of the latter are more frequently 
thick-walled and hard. 

Vhe fungi on which I have most often 
observed the larvae in question are Aec?- 
dium caladié, the cluster cup of Arz- 
saema and other aroids. Coleosportum 
sonchi-arvensts, the common rust of As- 
ter and Solidago, and Caeoma nitens, 
the destructive red-rust everywhere 
abundant in spring on leaves of the 
blackberry and raspberry (2edzs). 

Mr. C. V. Riley informs me that he 
has also found the same larvae on a fun- 
eus (Exobasidium vacctnit?) growing 
on Azalea, and that they have been

colored fungus covering a squash, Cauczr-

lard, speaking of Caeoma ewonymd and 
Aecidium convallartiae in the vicinity 
of Paris, says that their spores are fre-

orange color.? 

These larvae differ in their fungivo- 
rous habits from the greater number of 
cecidomyians, which feed on the juices 
of phaenogams, causing atrophy, as in 
the case of wheatattacked by Cec¢domya 
destructor, the hessian fly, or the de- 
velopment of galls such as most of the 
cecidomytidae produce. Some species, 
notably Cectdomyéa triticz. the wheat 
fly, feed upon pollen, at least in the 
early part of their lives, in this respect

naturally fall among the useful species. 
Even the golden-rods and asters are of 
some importance to bee-keepers, and 
the onslaughts of the insects on the 
spores of the raspberry rust and other 
parasites of cultivated plants must tend 
to check the spread of these fungi, so 
that in a measure they protect the flow- 
ering plants on which they live, as does 
the species referred to by Vallot. 


Entomologists are familiar with cer- 
tain black spots, several millimetres in 
diameter, in the leaves of golden rods 
and asters.  Solédago lanceolata and 
S. tenutfolia frequently — 
marked in this manner than other spe- 


are more

cabinets of economic entomologists as

They also occur in the 


the names #hytesma solidagints and 
&amp;R. asteris given them a half century 
ago by Schweinitz. 

On narrow-leaved species of So/¢dago. 
e.g.. S. lanceolata, the spots. visible 
on both surfaces of the leaf, are some- 
times almost circular, varying in diam- 
eter from 1 to 4 mm.; but more com- 
monly they are elongated parallel to 
the axis of the leaf. so as to be ellipti- 
cal or oblong. They are usually sym- 


metrical, unless the centre is situated 
at one side of the midrib of the narrow 
leaf. in which case the corresponding. 
side is necessarily truncated on reaching 
the margin. The leaf is always slight- 


ly swollen in the discolored spot. but

the enlargement occurs so uniformly 
in all parts that neither the midrib nor 
lateral obliterated. Now 
and then spots of the same nature are 


nerves are 
seen on the stem, where they are more 
irregular than on the leaf, and common- 
ly occupy somewhat swollen portions 
of the internodes. The surface of the 
spot is of a dead coal-black, occasion- 
ally slightly glossy on the nerves. Some- 
times the black passes into a deep purple 
at the edge of the spot, due to the pres- 
ence of a soluble pigment in the diseased 
epidermal cells, this color changing 
gradually into the green of the surround- 
ing leaf. In other cases it is bordered 
by a narrow white ring, forming a sharp 
line of demarcation between the black 
on the one hand and the green on the 
other, or more rarely separating the 
black from a purple zone, which grad- 
ually passes into the green. 

On broader leaved species, like So/7- 
dago ulmifolia and WS. caesza, the spots 
are more frequently round or slightly 
irregular, extending without interrup- 
tion over the smaller veins or even the 
midrib.

It has been seen that the single or 
double convexity of these galls is not 
available as a distinctive character, al- 


though Schweinitz makes use of it. 


One of the most obvious superficial 


characters is the presence or absence of 


a white, gray or yellow membrane over 
the carbonized portion of the leaf. 
This, the velam of Schweinitz, is how- 
ever by no means constantly absent or 
present in the same species, if we ex- 
cept that on So/¢dago lanceolata, where 
I have never seen it. On the same 
plant of S. w/mzfol/a some spots are 
black, while others are invested on both 
surfaces by the yellowish-white indusi- 
um: and one of the Osten Sacken types 
of the gall of Cectdomyta carbonifera, 
on a broad leaved Sol/dago, for an ex- 
amination of which I am indebted to 
the courtesy of Dr. H. A. Hagen, is 
black above, with a narrow white bor- 
der, while below it is completely cov- 
ered by a white indusium, broken here 
and there as if by accident. With age 
this membrane frequently breaks away, 
but in the specimens to which the pre- 
ceding statements refer the leaves were 
intact, and its absence was clearly not 


due to removal, 


In their microscopic characters, all of 


these forms show a general agreement. 
The parenchyma of the leaf is invaded 
by a colorless mycelium of thick-walled 
hyphae, which lives between the cells 
and to a certain extent deforms them. 
It excites little if any hypertrophy, but 
by crowding the cells apart in its own

growth causes the slight convexity of the 
part of the leaf in which it occurs. 
Near the surface the mycelial threads 
become brown, apparently as the result 
of some chemical action due to the fun- 
gus, which also affects the surrounding 
cells of the leaf. some of which are so 
completely carbonized that their walls 
are coal-black. In &amp;. solédaginés and 
the other exindusiate forms, the epider- 
mis is especially influenced by this 
change. which, however sometimes does 
not extend so far laterally as in the un- 
derlying tissue,—a fact which at once 
explains the pale border sometimes no- 
ticed ; the dead but colorless epidermal 
cells at the margin of the spot. filled 
with air. appearing white, and contrast- 
ing strongly with the carbonized cells 
on the one hand and with the living ones 
on the other. The indusium of the other 
forms is of a similar nature to this border, 
consisting merely of the dead epidermis, 
filled with air; but why the epidermis 
should be blackened in some cases and 
remain colorless in others it is hard to 
say. 

From what precedes it will be seen 
that only two of the three so-called spe- 
cies of Rhytisma are certainly distin- 
guishable in the specimens that I have 
examined, viz: 7. solédagénis, on So- 
“idago lanceolata and S. tenutfolia, 
and 2. asterés (including PR. dzéfrons) 
on Aster and the broader leaved spe- 
cies of So/7dago.* Curtis, whose her- 
barium, containing many Schweinitzian 
specimens, I have examined, through

the kindness of Professor W. G. Farlow. 
was evidently of the same opinion, for 
his specimens bear only these two names, 
though some of the last named species 
occur on Sol¢dago, and one, on Aster 
gracilis, agrees very well with the de- 
scription of &amp;. b¢frons. Schweinitz, 
also, says of the three so-called species

of Rhytisma, it does not develop on the 
living leaf. and I have been unable to 
look for it on the fallen leaves late in 
autumn or on the approach of the fol- 
lowing spring. Possibly, when found, 
it may offer a means of distinguishing 
the so-called species more satisfactorily 
than can be done at present. Both spe- 
cies are widely distributed over the east- 
ern third of the continent, from the Gulf 
states to New Brunswick.

While the slight convexity of the young

to be caused by the insect, and these very

lives only in leaves previously attacked 


by the latter; but the great powers of 


multiplication and dissemination pos-

belief that the former is the case, the

The extraordinary symmetry which 
occurs among insects is usually brought 
prominently forward in most of the 
books which treat of entomology. Noth- 
ing is pictured more symmetrically than, 
for instance, the structures of bees and 
ants, or the color of butterflies, which 
latter is prominently reputed to have a 
perfectly symmetrical bilateral equality. 
Although there is much truth at the bot- 
tom of al) this, although nature in many 
cases works with great symmetry, yet 
it must not be overlooked that even this 
converted into its 


symmetry is often

Nectrta, etc. From the carbonization 
of all the species of Rhytisma, it is prob- 
able that the color of the galls in the 
present instance is due to the fungus.

I no longer have access to good material 
these notes are published in their pres-

a very interesting subject for further 
study.” 

7 Sections of an undetermined cecidomyid gall on 
Impatiens fulva, from Medford, Mass., prepared in my 
labaratory by Miss L. N. Martin, show a mycelium 
somewhat similar to that noticed in Aster and Solidago 
leaves, and there is also a certain amount of carboniza- 
tion. It will be interesting to observe whether the 


mycelium is always present in this gall which is not 
uncommon,

strict opposite. Surely no observing 
lepidopterologist has failed to notice 
that the coloration of the wings of his 
favorites is to be recognized as strictly 
symmetrical only in the smallest num- 
ber of cases, that. indeed, that of one 
side, which certainly resembles that of 
the other in its superficial aspect, still 
shows many differences in its details, 
and there is little foundation for assert-

species of Vanessa, Argynnis, Meli- 
taea, Arctéa, etc. Ihave found this also 
very striking in Pap7lio machaon, a 
specimen of which, now in my collec- 
tion, has a distinct black spot in the first 
yellow area at the tip of the left front 
wing, while, as usual, there is no such 
spot on the right wing. 

In how diverse a manner nature works, 
moreover, in 
one and the same species, in animals 
which are sought for as so-called varie- 
ties, a striking proof is given by collec- 
tions which contain often ten or twelve 
or even more specimens of one and the 
same animal. How long one has to 
hunt among duplicates in order to find 
two butterflies which are perfectly alike ! 
This field of inquiry has interested me 
to an unusual degree for a long time 
and I have had the good fortune to ob- 
tain many interesting results in it. 
Here again Papilio machaon, Arctia 
caja, different noctuids and geometrids 
(for instance, Adraxas grossulariata) , 
have excited my special delight by their 
peculiarly diverse clothing. 

But the so-called gynandromorphs, 
especially those of the lepidoptera, are 
yet far more remarkable. As is well 
known, these are animals which show 
the coloration and structure of one sex 
on the right wings, and those of the 
other sex on the left wings. Of course 
these can only be observed in such ani- 
mals as show some kind of difference 
between the coloration and shape of the 
wings, or the form and structure of the

one antenna male, the other female, that 
is to say, one filiform, the other pecti- 
nate. In its other characters, especially 
in the coloration of the wings, the speci- 
men appears throughout to be a female. 

Finally some attention may be be- 
stowed upon crippling among insects. 
My few observations again concern the 
butterflies. Mutilations often occur in 
these on one side only, and on account 
of this unfortunate circumstance the 
specimen which had been so carefully 
nursed as larva and pupa is entirely 
useless for the collection, and is ill- 
humoredly thrown aside by the raiser 
unless it is kept in spirits to furnish 
occasion for subsequent observations.

breeding purposes, and so deny various 
uses to the one who has raised them, 
yet for other reasons I should not want 
to condemn such a specimen without 
further consideration. In spite of all 
apparent irregularity, nature often works 
quite regularly, as is well shown by 
the annexed figure. This specimen was 
going to be thrown away together with 
several other cripples, when Mr. Reich-

in the pupa. From this observation it 
is easy to conclude that this was the 
cause of the mutilation that has been 
mentioned, and since the continuous 
pressure was here a perfectly uniform 
one, the irregular development could 
not but be perfect and uniform. Whether 
such a mutilation can also be produced 
artificially with this regularity might be 
learned from our investigations which 
are to be instituted for the purpose. 

A single glance at a_ bee-hive will 
convince one that there are many irreg- 
ularities also in the colonies of bees. 
The most regular structures made by 
bees are the cells, which, as is well

CORRESPONDENCE. 


NOTICE OF AN OMISSION FROM LECONTE’S 
EDITION OF THOMAS SAyY’s WRITINGS.—In 
the Journal of the Academy of natural sci- 
ence of Philadelphia, July 1817, v. 1, p. 45- 
48, Thomas Say, in an article entitled, 
“Some account of the insect known by the 
name of Hessian fly, and of a parasitic insect 
that feeds on it,” describes Cecrdomyia de- 
structor and its parasite Ceraphron destruc- 
vor, and gives a short account of the habits 
of each species. This article is reprinted 
correctly in Leconte’s edition of Say’s writ- 
2, p. 6-7. On p. 63 of the Journal, 
for August 1817, however, just before the 
explanation to the plate, Say inserted a note 
which Leconte overlooked and which is here 


ings, v. 


republished, both as showing a curious mis- 
take made by Say, and to correct the omis- 
sion from the ‘‘Complete writings.” Say 
says — 

“I forgot to mention in its proper place 
that the parasitic insect, Ceraphron destruc- 
tor, which is so commonly mistaken for the 
Cecidomyia, after the business of propaga- 
tion is performed, throws off its wings as a 
useless incumbrance, in this respect resem- 
bling some species of the genera Formica, 
Termes, &amp;c., to which it also bears some 
resemblance in point of form and appear- 
ance; this has led many to suppose that the 
Hessian-fly is in reality no other than a 
species of pissmire in its apterous state. 
T. Say.” 

Of course Say is mistaken in his statement 
that the wings were shed after copulation. 
It not uncommonly occurs among the /fe- 
romalinae that certain individuals (both male 
and female) have only rudimentary wings — 
mere pads which never become developed 


into wings. ‘This is the case with the species 


under consideration, the relative propor- 
tion of the winged to the wingless individ- 
uals varying with the climate and_ the 


season.

“The present werk is divided into four divisions, of 
which the first presents a striking array of facts on the 
origin of the markings of caterpillars. The author de- 
scribes the nature and morphology of the markings of 
larvae of the family sphingidae, their biological value 
and tribal development, concluding that the oldest 
sphingid caterpillars were without markings; that the 
oldest style of markings were longitudinal lines, the 
later oneS oblique streaks, and the last to be developed, 
the spots.”"—Amer. nat., 1. c. The second part dis- 
cusses the relation of changes in the structure of larvae 
to their changes as imagos,; variation and dimorphism.

AN EXCELLENT idea for publications of local 
scientific societies is carried out by the Verein 
fiir naturkunde zu Cassel, in its Bericht for 
1883 to 1884. Over one-half of this Bericht 
is devoted to a list, by Dr. Carl Ackermann, 
of scientific works of all kinds pertaining 
to Cassel and its vicinity. In the portion of 
the list devoted to the distribution of animals 
is to be found mention of many papers upon 
the insect fauna of the above-mentioned re- 


gion.

AT A recent meeting of the Baltimore 
Naturalists’ field club, Mr. Otto Lugger gave 
an account of a strange hymenopterous par- 
asite infesting the larva of TZzAhia. The 
Tiphia lays its eggs in the larva of Lacknos- 
terna fusca; the larva of T7zphkza when nearly 
mature eats the white grub and then spins for 
itselfa beautiful silken cocoon. This larva 
in turn is often infested by the larva 
Rhipiphorus pectinatus or Ie. limtatus, the 
eggs of which have become fastened to the 
Tiphia, and in this way reach the 77phra 
cocoon. Mr. Lugger has also found in the 
same cocoons small hymenopterous parasites. 
The order of events in this case appears to be 
that the larva of a large coleopterous insect 
is destroyed by a hymenopterous larva, this 
in turn by a coleopterous larva, and this 
again by a hymenopterous larva.—Scrence

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CONTRI- 

BUTIONS. 

THe CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB 
being so constituted that entomologists in 
all parts of North America may become 
active members and acquire the 
same rights to control its affairs and direct 
members 


thereof 


its policy that are possessed by 
resident in Cambridge, expects from North 
American entomologists a support as liberal 
as its constitution. 

PsycHe, being conducted under the direc- 
tion of the Club, free from local or partisan 
interests, is likewise entitled to liberal sup- 
port. Subscribers to PsyCHE borrow 
from the library of the Club any 


may 
works

which could be replaced in case of loss, upon 
compliance with the simplest conditions 
practicable. Thus subscribers who live at a 
distance from libraries may obtain, through 
the mails, the benefit of access toa valuable 
entomological library, constantly increasing 
by means of donations and the receipt of 
publications in exchange for PSYCHE. 

A Permanent Publication Fund has been 
established by the Club,.the income alone of 
which is used to assist in defraying the cost 
of the publication of PsYCHE. As yet the 
fund is too small to furnish the amount of 
income needed. The Club does not hesitate 
to ask the friends of entomology to contrib- 
ute to this fund, believing that their favorite 
science will be benefitted thereby. 

In default of a regular income sufficient to 
defray the cost of the publication of PsyCHE, 
reliance has had to be placed on the timely 
assistance of special friends of the work. As 
yet such friends have not been wanting, who 
have assisted by donations or the advance- 
ment of the money needed. 

In March 1884 a staterhent of the finan- 
cial condition of the Club for the year 1883 
was sent to a large number of subscribers to 
Psycue, with a form of agreement for sub- 
scription to a guarantee fund for the pay- 
ment of the deficit on the cost of publishing 
Psycue for 1883, as that deficit might stand 
on 1 July 1884. Bills were at the same time 
sent to all persons who were indebted to the 
Club, with a special request for payment of 
dues. The following persons agreed to pay 
the amounts set against their names, or so 
much fro vata as might be needed to meet 
the deficit :—

The female is somewhat larger, more 
elongate and more convex than the male 
and is without the long and dense 
pubescence so conspicuous in that sex ; 
the head, and especially the eyes are 
smaller; the thorax is larger, much 
more convex laterally and longitudi- 
nally, the base less lobed at middle, 
and is much less densely and more 
coarsely punctured; viewed from above

an irregular outline, is centrally placed 
in the female, andthe club is regularly 
oval in outline. 

The legs of the female are stouter, and

E. D. Jones describes a remarkable 
drinking habit of a yellow and black 
Brazilian moth (Pazxthera [corr.| par- 
dalaria). He found these moths sit- 
ting on the wet stones in small streams 
near San Paulo, sucking up the water 
in a continuous stream, and letting it 
escape in drops from the abdomen. 
These drops fell at the average rate of 
50 per minute, and as near as he could 
judge of their size, the total quantity of 
water which must thus pass through the 
body of the moth in three hours must 
be a cubic inch, or about 200 times the 
bulk of its own body. Mr. Jones spec- 


ulates on the possible meaning of this

Between the females of /Zypotrichia 
and those of Pleocoma evidences of re- 
lationship are not wanting, and as both 
must now be considered members of the 
melolonthian series, a closer comparison 
than has yet been made will possibly 
bring the two genera into still more in- 
timate relations. The series of genera, 
fly potrichia, Plectrodes and Pleocoma, 
exhibits a very instructive passage from 
a winged insect with active powers of 
flight, asin the male of H/yfotrichia, 
to the degraded, wingless, and wholly 
subterranean female of PZleocoma.

matters 
buried in their thorax, to be thrust out 
at will during larva-hood, or permanent- 
ly in the adult. Some years ago I spent 
fruitless time in attempting to investi- 
gate this structure; but recent research- 
es on the head and proboscis of the adult 
have enabled me to return to the attack 
with greater success. Mr. Walter M. 
Rankin has cut for me some excellent 
transverse sections of the head of the 
larva of Zusca caesar, and by their help 
as well as by teasing I have got the 
following results. 

1. Vhe head has adouble skeleton, 
the one independent of the other: (1) 
a large dark-colored case, figured by 
Weismann,} 
mid-, and distant parts, the distant part 


consisting of proximal, 
being the well-known ‘thooks” (really a 
bifurcated piece) ; (2) a chitinous arma- 
ture lining the pharynx: outside of the 
pharynx-wall (therefore organically in 
the head) are muscles which join it to 
the larger, dark-colored case. 

2. The dark-colored part represents 
the fulcrum, mid-segment, and the fork- 
ed distal supports of the proboscis of the 
adult. The relation of parts is the 
same asin the adult: the salivary duct, 
made by the union of the ducts of the 
paired salivary glands, enters the mouth 
at the mid-proboscis as in the adult,

state of 


and the longitudinal and transverse mus- 
cles are much as they shall always be. 

3. The 
part, appear to be the precursors of the 


“hooks”, or forked distal 
upper fork of the adult disti-proboscis : 
they have also inferior processes repre- 
senting the inferior fork of the same. 
Perhaps these hooks are the mandibles. 

4. The armature of the pharynx 
consists of a chitinous sheath lining its 
lumen. On the floor of this are eight 
longitudinal bars, which are found on 
cross-section to be hollow, each with a 
longitudinal slit opening towards the 
lumen of the pharynx. 

5. On tracing the pharynx-arma- 
ture to its anterior extremity we find 
that it terminates abruptly by a rim 
which supports a number of teeth at the 
roots of the longitudinal bars referred 
to. Here we have evidence that the 
longitudinal bars of the larva represent 
the pseudotracheae of the adult; they 
open by a long slit, and have transverse 
semi-rings so as to produce a resemblance 
to tracheae, all as in the pseudotracheae. 

6. Hence the slit tubes which line 
the pharynx of the larva are identical 
with the pseudotracheae of the adult; 
and the swollen ‘‘labella” of the disti- 
proboscis of the adult are the everted 
stomodaeum, whilst its supporting forks 
are probably the mandibles. 

7. The muscular apparatus for open- 
ing the pharynx is as in the adult. Long 
muscles descend from the walls of the

It will be borne in mind that at the 
time of my visit, 29 March to 21 June 
1884, a large tract of country near Bay-

great crevasse of March the same year. 
For 
species to which these notes refer, I am

low lands of that part of the state. I 
saw only two specimens of this family 
(one larva of Zetracha carolina, and 
one Cic¢indela repanda) in the latitude 
of New Orleans. Afterwards I saw 
C. tortuosa with C. repanda at the 
mouth of Red River. Though I visit-

Brachynus tormentartus is abundant 
under old wood in moist places. This is 
a much larger species than our northern 
bombardiers, and emits its explosions 
vigorously and with continued frequen- 
cy, causing great pain unless carefully 
handled. Kirby and Spence state that 
they were informed by M. Lacordaire 
that the burning sensation arising from 
the discharges of the large exotic species 
was so painful that he had often been 
obliged to let those which he had taken 
escape.* ‘This species may be among 
those to which M. Lacordaire had refer-

exotic species.” These beetles have a

to take the alarm from the one which 
first detected the danger and gave the 
signal by emitting its explosion; for all 
the others, wherever they might be, 
would follow with their explosions as 
soon as they heard that of one of their 
number. By this habit I often discov- 
ered individuals that had hidden in holes, 
or under leaves in the dirt. 

In the flooded forest growths near 
Bayou la Fourche I found several of the 
ground-frequenting carabédae ( Chilae-

others) under chips upon stumps that

of these genera might be produced in 
this way. if inundation were to prevail 
for a sufficient length of time and the 
trees themselves continued to flourish 
in the water as well as before. Before 
the levee system was constructed the 
coleoptera as well as the other animals 
of southern Louisiana were undoubted- 
ly accustomed to the periodical inunda- 
tions caused by the risings of the 
Mississippi forcing them to seek habi- 
tation elsewhere than on the ground.

of ELudoctmus mannerheimit, besides 
some cerambycidae (Leptura abdome- 
zalis) and some other coleoptera all on 
one stump a good distance out in the 
flooded forest. 

Not a specimen of the s¢7phidae was 
taken ; this is undoubtedly owing to the 
great numbers of buzzards, which eftect- 
ually clean up every thing in the shape 
of carrion. 

I noticed that specimens of D¢cerca 
obscura, instead of taking immediate 
flight when alarmed, loosed their hold 
fromthe plants (wormwood [ Artenecséa | 
and ragweed [Amérostia] ) to which 
they were clinging, and dropped to the 
ground like weevils ; which is a far more 
inactive mode of escape than that em- 
ployed by some others of this family, for 
example Chrysobothris femorata. 

Chauliognathus marginatus, which 
is very abundant upon patches of blos- 
som in the South, séems to prefer yellow 
flowers, as its color assimilates better 
with the yellow; and upon these it is 
generally found. Though it is some- 
times found upon white daisies, the stig- 
mata of these are yellow, and help to 
blend the color of the insect with that 
of the flower. I noticed on 17 April that 
many of these insects were infested with 
a little red mite.

throcephalus on a tuft of the common 
ragweed [Ambrosia artemtsiacfolia],

ready to prove effective should they have 
the audacity to meddle with it.

specimen of Acanthoderes quadrigib-

as soon as I picked it up. 

This species almost invariably drops 
when approached. In color it assim- 
ilates so well with the whitened boards, 
or other old, weathered pieces of wood 
to which it may be clinging, that it is 
often difficult to detect it. The habit 
of dropping and remaining perfectly 
motionless for a short time has been 
acquired by many coleoptera as a means 
from some of their

enemies. But in this instance the beetle, 
instead of escaping, drew my attention 
right upon it by this habit. 

When J7ecas tnornata sees any one 
approaching towards it, at some distance, 
it generally takes wing and flies a long 
ways; but if one is very near and about 
to capture a specimen it usually drops 
and feigns death.

INDEX TO ENTOMOLOGICAL LITER- 
ATURE. 


The time consumed by special students in 
searching through a whole literature for 
those portions of it which bear upon their 
special studies is largely wasted. The litera- 
ture of special subjects is so scattered, and 
that of different subjects so intermingled, 
that each student who tries to find for him- 
self what relates to the subjects he is studying 
is obliged to peruse a great deal of literature 
that is not of service to him, far more, in- 
deed, than that which he can use, in propor- 
tion as the subjects he is studying form but 
a fraction of all the subjects treated in the 
literature. Here, as in other fields of labor, 
specialization carries with it economy and 
efficiency. The diligent worker who, labor- 
ing to that end, by comprehensive methods 
forms an index to all the special subjects 
treated in the literature as he examines it 
finds himself at last able to refer without 
hesitancy or waste of time to all the litera- 
ture which treats of any of these specialties. 
He is then in a position to supply the needs 
of the specialists first mentioned. While 
but few persons are interested in these refer- 
ences as a whole, each specialist finds the

entomology, I will furnish references on

for Rhipiphorus to lay its eggs on Tiphra. 
The probability, as stated in the report cited, 
is that the eggs are deposited on flowers fre-

fastens and by which it is carried into the 
ground. It would be interesting to know 
whether Mr. Lugger speaks from observation 
or conjecture.—C. V. Ritey, af meeting of

has observed Pulvinaria tnnumerabilis in 
great abundance on Acer dasycarpum, A.

plants, and mentions with doubtful credence 
the opinions of Emily A. Smith and C. V. 
Riley that they had also found it on Sax, 
Maclura, Quercus, Ulmus, Platanus, Ribes, 
Euonymus and Celtis. It undoubtedly occurs 
in very great abundance on Maclura hedges 
in Washington, D. C., as I have observed. 
On the 30th of June this year (1884) I 
received from F. R. Rathbun, of Auburn, N. 
Y., three twigs of U/mus, gathered on the 
28th, in Auburn, bearing respectively 1, 1 and 
3 specimens of mature Pulvinarta innumera- 
bilis, with fully developed nests, from which 
the larvae have since hatched in great num- 
bers. These all came from one tree. In 
sending specimens previously, Mr. Rathbun 
wrote that ‘‘the maples [Acer] especially 
have the silky pussys or cocoons to a large 
extent, and they are invariably found on the 
under sides of the twigs. Sometimes they

evidence to show that this insect is capable 
of thriving on quite a variety of food-plants, 
and in the cases where it has been directly in- 
troduced from the maple there is no question 
of its identity.” The specimens referred 
to in this communication will be deposi- 
ted in the Museum of comparative zoology 
at Cambridge, Mass., where they are more 
certain of good care and of being accessible 
to students than in any other collection of 
national extent in the country.—B: Pick-

Dr. G: Dimmock explained an apparatus 
by which he was enabled to rear insects in 
gases of different kinds or in determinate pro- 
portions of gases and air. 

Dr. G: Dimmock described the way in 
which the red mites that were so abundant 
about Cambridge this year produced the fine, 
light colored lines upon leaves of clover, 
grass and other plants. Leaves which had 
been marked by these mites were shown. 

Mr. R. Hayward stated that an Ontho- 
phagus which he had for some time supposed 
to be a new American species proved to be O. 
lutetcornts from Europe. 

10 Oct. 1884.—The 104th meeting was held 
at 61 Sacramento St., Cambridge, 10 Oct. 
The meeting was called to order at 
8 p.m. In the absence of the president, Mr. 
R. Hayward was chosen chairman. 

The secretary announced the withdrawal 
from the club of Mr. F. C. Bowditch, of 
Brookline, Mass. 

Dr. H. A. Hagen made some inquiries in 
regard to the condition and accessibility of 
the library of the Club, and offered some 


226 


suggestions in regard to its management. 
After considerable discussion it was decided 
to refer the matter to the Executive com- 
mittee. 

Mr. B: P. Mann presented (through the sec- 
retary) a communication upon ‘‘Food-plants 
of Pulvinaria innumerabilis.” [Printed in 
Psyche, Oct.-Dec. 1884, v. 4, p. 224. ] 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed a large larva of 
some species of oestridae (? Cuterebra emas- 
culator), which had been sent to him by Mr. 
Leroy H. Sykes, of Suffield, Conn. This 
larva was taken by Mr. Sykes, about 20 Sept. 
1884, from beneath the skin of a chip-squirrel 
(Lamias striatus) just at the right of the 
median ventral line near the umbilicus. Mr. 
Sykes thinks the squirrel was a castrated 
male. . . 
Dr. H. A. Hagen commented upon and 
read some notes from a manuscript journal 
of Christoph Zimmermann, chiefly concern- 
ing the coleopterist Dr. F. E. Melsheimer and 
his relatives. Zimmermann, who came to 
Philadelphia in 1832, later visited Melsheimer 
at his home in Hanover, Pa., and describes 
his visit. [See Canadian entomologist. Oct. 
1884, v. 16, p. 191-197. ] 

14 Noy. 1884.—The rosth meeting was held 
at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 14 Nov. 1884, 
the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder in the 
chair. 

The secretary gave notice of the withdraw- 
al from the club of Prof. E. L. Mark, of 
Cambridge, Mass. 

Dr. H. A. Hagen alluded to some inter- 
esting points in the histology of the rectal 
muscles of a lepidopterous larva, recently 
brought to light by Rev. F: T. Hazlewood, of 
Lynn, Mass. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder exhibited a piece of 
leather-like fabric produced by the larvae of 
some species of Mexican lepidoptera; and 
also showed seed-capsules of a species of 
Pelargonium, which were perforated by some 
insect in escaping from them. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder exhibited a specimen 
of a carboniferous arachnid (Geralinura car- 
bonaria) recently discovered at Mazon Creek,

Illinois, which was of interest because it was 
the first recorded instance of a fossil of the 
order to which it belongs,—the fedrfalpi. 
It was described in June last in the Proceed- 
ings of the American academy of arts and 
sciences. Curiously enough, only nine days 
later, another species of the same genus. from 
Rakowitz, Bohemia, was described by Kusta 
under the name Thelyphonus bohemicus, ina 
paper in the Transactions of the Bohemian 
academy, which has just reached this coun- 
try. This adds still another to the already 
frequent instances of the occurrence of the 
same generic type of arthropods in the car- 
boniferous deposits of Europe and America. 

Dr. H. A. Hagen made some remarks in 
regard to swarming of Atropos divinatortus 
in houses. 

12 Dec. 1884.—The 106th meeting was held 
at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 12 Dec. 1884, 
the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder in the 
chair. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder made some remarks 
upon a fossil beetle from Ontario, Canada, 
and upon a fossil scorpion from the silurian. 
This scorpion had been mentioned by Lins- 
trém ina letter to a friend in this country, 
and an extended notice of it will be prepared 
in conjunction with Thorell. This discovery 
is important, as it places the origin of the 
arachnotdea back in the silurian, and because 
of its showing further peculiar characters 
which may ally it to the mevostomata. 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed pieces of the ex- 
crementof the larva of Sphinx drupiferarum, 
which are often of excessive length in pro- 
portion to their diameter, in comparison 
with the excrement of other sAhingidae. 
This prolongation of the excrement of the 
larva of this species is coordinate with a 
prolongation of the part of the larva behind 
the “caudal horn.” Dr. Dimmock also ex- 
hibited excrement of an undetermined larva 
which feeds on Prnus strobus; the excrement 
consisted of pieces, each made up of three 
spheroids arranged in a straight line. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder reviewed a paper on 
fossil insects, mostly cockroaches, published 
by Moritz Kliver, in Palacontographica for 
1883, under the title ‘‘Ueber einige neue 
blattinarien-, zwei dictyoneura- und zwei 
arthropleura-arten aus der Saarbrucker stein- 
kohlenformation.”

These shells, though calcareous, were pro- 
nounced not to be the production of any

was that they must be egg-cases of some 
insect.”

THE COMPOSITION and properties of the 
light emitted by insects of the Pyrophore 
genus form the subject of a paper recently 
presented to the Paris academy of sciences 
by Aubert and P. Dubois. The spectrum of 
the light, examined by the spectroscope, is 
very beautiful, but destitute of dark bands. 
When, however, the intensity diminishes, 
the red and orange disappear, and the green 
and yellow only remain.— Sc/ence, 28 Nov. 
1884, v. 4, p- 505. 


Pror. A. J: Cook read a paper before the 
Natural-history society of the Michigan 
agricultural college, on 12 Sept., on extra- 
floral nectar. ‘‘Bees had been noticed to be 
extensively at work on the heads of grasses. 
These proved to be covered with the sweetish 
secretion due to ergot. The honey made 
from this material was very agreeable to the 
taste, ranking with the best, while honey 
made from the secretions of plant-lice is 
often very poor and disagreeable.” 


ACCORDING TO Scéence for 21 Nov. 1884 
(Bulletin, p. 5), at the meeting of the Tren- 
ton natural-history society ‘Prof. Austin C. 
Apgar detailed his experiments with naph- 
thalin on Axthrenus scrophulartae. Larvae 
left an infested object, and for two weeks 
lived in an air-tight case, in vapor so dense 
that it crystallized on the cover-glass. Even 
then they only apparently died, for, on 
removal, one and walked away. 
Herbarium mites were killed in half an hour

Ph. Frangois, of Poitiers, and A. Lameere, 
of Brussels, whose papers were judged equal-

enemies of this species that the tadpoles ‘‘are

meeting of the Linnean society of London, 7 
Feb. 1884, printed in the Zoolog?scher anzet-

an interesting communication embodying his 
researches on the compound vision of insects* 
He compares the structures of the simple 
ocellus with those of the compound ocellus 
(common in larval insects) and with those of 
the compound eye. The compound eye ac- 
cording to him is but composed of aggrega- 
ted compound ocelli, or the latter in the 
larval insect is merely equivalent to a single 
segment of a compound eye. He reters to

‘mosquito-blight,’ and the tea-mite or ‘red

delicate web which it spins for itself as a 
shelter. It punctures the leaves, and then 
pumps out the liquid contents of the epi- 
dermis. The only remedy which has been 
discovered to check their ravages, and it has 
not proved very effectual, is to sprinkle the 
affected bushes with muddy water. The 
tea-bug is still more destructive, and particu-

At THE meeting of the French entomolo- 
gical society held 23 July 1884, M. G. A. 
Poujade made the following remarks: 

“Prof. Edouard Bureau has stated (Ann. 
soc. entom. Fr., 1854; Bull., p. 22) that in 
lepidoptera of the genus Brephos, specimens 
which had been dried six days showed evi- 
dent spontaneous movements of the genital 
organs, which continued two days, but toward 
the last part of the time these movements 
were only produced when the extremity of 
the abdomen was touched. I have observed 
the same peculiarity in a PRhodocera rhamnt 
the extremity of the abdomen still moving 
when the rest of the insect was perfectly 
dry. 

A few days ago some one gave mea male 
Lucanus cervus which had been killed with 
vinegar five or six days before; the flabbiness 
of the joints left no doubt as to the death of 
the animal,—the penis alone, which was

partly exserted, had very evident movements 
which lasted two or three days longer. 

These facts, as M. Bureau has said, prove 
the predominance of the genital functions 
above all other functions, and it is not with- 
out interest to compare these observations 
with another well-known fact, the prolonga- 
tion of life among insects that have not 
paired.” 


AMONG NATURALISTS who have been more 
or less interested in entomology we have 
lately noticed announcements of the follow- 
ing deaths: Dr. Alfred Edmund Brehm, born 
in 1829, in Renthendorf, Germany, where he 
died 11 Nov. 1884; well-known as the editor 
of the “Illustrirtes thierleben.” Dr. Ernst 
Carstanjen, professor of chemistry in Leip- 
zig university and lepidopterist, died 13 July 
1884, in the forty-ninth year of his age. 
Auguste Chevrolat, a Parisian coleopterist 
and author of many entomological papers, 
died 16 Dec. 1884, in the eighty-sixth year of 
his age. O. J. Fahraeus, a coleopterist of 
Stockholm, Sweden, died in that place, 28 
May 1884, aged eighty-eight. Leopold 
Joseph Fitzinger, zoologist, born 13 April 
1802, in Vienna, Austria, died 22 Sept. 1884, 
in Hietzing, near Vienna. Dr. Arnold 
Forster, professor in Aachen, Germany, and 
hymenopterist, born 21 Jan. 1810, in Aachen, 
died 13 Aug. 1884, in the same place. A. 
Keferstein, lepidopterist, died 28 Nov. 1884, 
in Erfurt, Germany. Johann Gottfried Gott- 
lieb Mihlig, lepidopterist, died 12 April 1884, 
at Frankfort-a.-Main, Germany, nearly seven- 
ty-two years old. Joseph Antoine Maximi- 
lian Perty, professor from 1834-1875 in the 
university at Berne, Switzerland, died at 
Berne, 8 Aug. 1884, nearly eighty years old. 
Edmond Témésvary, a Hungarian naturalist, 
died 18 Aug. 1884, at Deva. Ernst Wehncke, 
a merchant in Harburg, Germany, and a 
specialist in dytiscédae and hydrophilidae, 
born 15 March 1835, died 19 Noy. 1883, in 
Harburg.

THE INSECTS OF BETULA IN 


NORTH AMERICA. 


BY ANNA KATHERINA DIMMOCK, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 


My attention was first drawn to the 
number of insects which feed upon 
plants of the genus Betawla when I set 
out to make a collection illustrating the 
different stages of insects found on Be- 
tula alba. I had exhibited stages of 
39 determined species, and intended to 
publish a simple list of these, but so 
many additions to the list were found 
later in scattered publications that fur- 
ther notes were added. Finally, after 
the publication of Dr. G: Dimmock’s 
‘Notes on pterophoridae of North 
America,”? [ 
notes in the form adopted in that article, 


determined to put the 


and to include the American insects of 
The 


have steadily increased in bulk, until 


the entire genus etula. notes 
they now include 107 determined spe- 
cies. his number would be still fur- 
ther augmented by the determination of 
several species which I have reared 
from Betula alba. Kaltenbach? gives 
270 European birch-feeding insects, and 
where the same species of insects are 
found in America I have added them to

der insecten. Stuttgart, 1874. 


this list. Packard? enumerates only 19 
species of American insects from Befu- 
Za. The numerous bibliographical ref- 
erences included, 
selected from those accumulated in the 


here which were 
progress of my work, refer generally to 
easily accessible works and are not in- 
appropriate in a bibliographical jour- 
nal like Psycue. Most of the citations 
have been verified,—a few are quoted. 
For many of them and for the free use of 
notes I am indebted to my husband, 
Dr. G: Dimmock. We have for sev- 
eral years reared and studied insects 
together, and some of the larvae men- 
in this article will be described 
by him later. My thanks are due fur- 
ther to Prof. C: H: Fernald, Dr. S: W. 
Williston, Messrs. S: Henshaw 
and R. Thaxter, for identifying insects 
belonging respectively to the microlep- 
idoptera, diptera, coleoptera, and ma- 


tioned 


and 


crolepidoptera. 

Quite extended lists of food-plants 
have been compiled in the case of cer- 
tain lepidoptera, because these insects 
are often reared for pleasure, and be- 
cause an accurate knowledge of food- 
plants is desirable, even for polyphag-

ous species. Here it might be added 
that Betula alba is very useful in 
rearing certain polyphagous species, 
since its leaves remain in good condi- 
tion for a long time, and are the favor- 
ite food-plant of many insects. Certain 
polyphagous species, as Afttacus cecro- 
pia, do not feed readily on other food- 
plants after having eaten birch. Larvae 
(especially of geometridae) of which 
the food-plant is unknown, can often be 
reared successfully on Betula alba, a 
fact to which I owe my successful rear- 
ing of Bxdropia armataria. 


ORTHOPTERA. 

Phaneroptera curvicauda De Geer (Mém. 
hist. ins., 1773, v. 3, p- 446, pl. 38, fig. 3). 
This species has been figured, together with 
the structure of its ovipositor, by Riley (6th 
rept. state entom. Mo., 1874, p. 164-166), who 
also gives descriptions of the younger stages, 
and eggs. Miss Murtfeldt (7. c.) describes 
the mode of oviposition: the eggs are laid in 
the margin of leavyes—often of oak—between 
the upper and lower epidermis. Altho 
Riley writes (2. c.), ‘‘I have had as many as 
five of these eggs deposited in a single leaf, 
in one contiguous row, yet they are more 
often single,” yet a single tender leaf of Be- 
tula alba, taken at Belmont, Mass., measur- 
ing about Scm. in length, had the entire 
margin filled with eggs, presumably of this 
species. Only two or three leaves were 
found thus attacked, and the one of which 
the size is given above contained 102 eggs. 

Caloptenus femur-rubrum De Geer (Mém, 
hist. ins., 1773, v- 3, p- 498, pl. 42, fig. 5) 
often strips the leaves from low bushes of 
Betula alba about Cambridge, Mass. 


RHYNCHOTA. 


Eviosoma tessellata Fitch (4th ann. rept.

According to Glover (Rept. U. S. commiss.

agric., 1876, p. 39) this species has been 
found in Maryland upon twigs of Betula. 

Callipterus betulaecolens Riley and Monell 
(Bull. U. S. geol. and geog. surv. terr., 1879, 
V. 5) p- 30-31) [? = Aphis betulaecolens Fitch 
(4th ann. rept. [N. Y.] state cab. nat. hist., 
1851, p- 66)]. Said by Fitch and Monell to 
feed on birch leaves. 

Calaphis betulella Walsh (Proc. Entom. 
soc. Phil., Dec. 1862, v. I, p. 301-302). 
Walsh (/. c., p- 302) says this species is 
abundant in Illinois on Betula nigra. 

Athysanus variabilis Fitch (4th ann. rept. 
[N. Y.] state cab. nat. hist., 1851, p. 60) is 
stated by Fitch (¢. c.) to be “abundant on 
birch trees, in June,” and the same author 
states (Ann. rept. N. Y. state agric. soc., 
1858, v. 18, p. 853) that this species punctures 
leaves and succulent shoots of birch. A 
brief description of this insect is given by 
Packard (Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 
1881, p. 128). ‘ 

Athysanus abietis Fitch (4th ann. rept. 
[N. Y.] state cab. nat. hist., 1851, p. 60) is 
stated by Fitch (Ann. rept. N. Y. state 
agric. soc., 1857, V- 17, p- 749) to feed on 
birch. Packard (Bull. 7, U. S. entom. 
comm., 1881, p. 235) briefly describes the 
species and gives Betuda as food-plant. 

Athysanus minor Fitch (4th ann. rept. [N. 
Y.] state cab. nat. hist., 1851, p. 60). Fitch 
(Z. c.) writes ‘Common on birch trees,” and 
adds (Ann. rept. N. Y. state agric. soc., 1858, 
y. 18, p- 853) that it punctures birch leaves. 
Packard (Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, 
p- 128) briefly describes this species. 

Athysanus fenestratus Fitch (4thann. rept. 
[N. Y.] state cab. nat. hist., 1851, p. 60) is 
stated by Fitch (Z. c.) to be found ‘-on birch 
trees,” and (Ann. rept. N. Y. state agric. soc., 
1858, v. 18, p. 853) to puncture birch leaves. 
This species is briefly described by Packard 
(Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, p. 128). 

Thelia univittata Harris (Treatise on ins. 
1842, p. 180). One specimen

cording to Harris (Z. c.), where it is common 
in July, according to Packard (Bull. 7, U.S. 
entom. comm., 1881. p. 37)- 

Enchenopa binotata Say (Appendix Long’s 
exped., 1824, p- 301-302). Common on 
twigs of Betula alba. Riley (Amer. entom., 
Aug. 1869, v. 1, p 248) says its favorite home 
is Pfelea trifolium, but gives grape (Vets) 
and red-bud (Cerczs) as food-plants. Its 
egg is described in Amer. entom., Oct. 1850, 
v. 3, p- 254. Lintner (1st ann. rept. state 
entom. N. Y., 1882, p. 281-288) gives an excel- 
lent general account of imago and eggs, both 
of which are figured. As food-plants he 
adds Celastrus scandens and, upon the au- 
thority of others, Fugdans and Pobinia. 

Bythoscopus semtnudus Say (Journ. Acad. 
nat. sci. Phil., 1829 [Mch. 1831], v. 6, p. 
307). Fitch (4th ann. rept. [N. Y.] state 
cab. nat. hist., 1851, p. 58) writes ‘‘Found 
on birch trees.” 

Tingts jugland?s Fitch (Ann. rept. N. Y. 
state agric. soc., 1856, v. 16, p. 466-467) is 
normally found, according to that author 
(4.c.) on Fuglans cinerea, but is some- 
times met with also on Betula, Salix, and 
other trees. Packard (Bull. 7, U. 5. entom. 
comm., 1881, p. 88) briefly describes this 
species, and mentions its food-plants. 


DIPTERA. 


Mallota posticata Fabr. (Syst. antl., 
1805, p. 237). Packard (Guide study ins.. 
1869, p- 399) figures the pupa and imago of 
this species under the name of AMerodon 
bardus Say. Lintner (ist ann. rept. state 
entom. N. Y., 1882, p. 211-216) gives an ex- 
tended account of this insect, figuring the 
puparium and imago, and describing the 
larvae, which were taken 
birch wood. 

Lonchaea ?polita Say (Journ. Acad. nat. 
sci. Phil., 1830, v. 6, p. 188). Reared in 
Cambridge, Mass.. from decaying Polyporus 
betulinus, a fungus parasitic on dead trunks 
of Betula alba.

LEPIDOPTERA. 


Argyresthia goedartella Linn. (Syst. nat., 
1758, ed. ro, p. 897). Fabricius (Syst. 
entom., 1775, p. 664) writes of this species 
‘‘Habitat in alnetis, in betulae gemmis,” and 
Kaltenbach (Planzenfeinde, 1872, p. 604-605) 
states that the larvae of this species live in 
the catkins of Betula and Alnus. Chambers 
(Can. entom., Aug. 1875, v. 7, p. 144-145) 
notes the discovery of this species in North 
America, and, after describing the imago, 
adds ‘‘The larva feeds under the bark and 
in the young shoots of the birch in March 
and April.” A. Balding (Entom. monthly 
mag., Feb. 1885, v. 21, p. 203-206) describes 
the larva, which he found feeding in catkins 
of Betula and Alnus. 

Cryptolechia confertella Walk. 
ins. Brit. mus.. 1864, pt. 29, p. 


(List lep. 
563). The 
larvae of this species are common upon Be- 
tula alba during August and the early part 
of September. The larva feeds in a rolled 
portion of the margin of the leaf, where pu- 
pation takes place, lasting from three weeks 
to a month. 

Paedisca stmilana Hibn. (Samml. auserl. 
végel u. schmett., 1792, fig. 71). Kaltenbach 
(Pflanzenfeinde, 1872, p. 602) gives a very 
brief description of the larva of this species, 
which feeds upon Betula. 

Paedisca transmissana Walk. (List lep. 
ins. Brit. mus , 1863, pt. 28, p. 375). The 
larva of this species is common, during Octo- 
ber, about Cambridge, Mass., where it eats 
out the inside of the sterile catkins of Betula 
alba. It hibernates as pupa. 

Paedisca solicttana Walk. (List lepid. ins. 
Brit. mus., 1863, pt. 28, p. 387). Fernald 
(Trans. Amer. entom. soc., 1882, v. 10, p. 40) 
says of this species ‘‘Food.— Betula alba var. 
populifolia.” 

Sertcorts urticana Hiibn. (Samml. europ. 
schmett., Tort., 1800?, fig. 65). Kaltenbach 
(Pflanzenfeinde, 1872, p. 601) gives a very 
brief description of the larva, following Zel- 
ler (Isis, 1846, p. 229) and among other food- 
plants mentions Getula.

Betula alba, about Cambridge, Mass. Among 
them may be mentioned a case-bearer (?

which has a case made of successive rings of 
leaf-epidermis arranged in the form of a cor- 
nucopia, and a large leaf-miner belonging to 
some genus allied to Lzthocodletis; the larvae 
of the last two species are found very late in

the therevidae and Apiocera are weaker

are long and slender, instead of being 
short and robust. So that, if Apiocera 
is closely related to the asilina, it is still 
more closely related to the therevidae.

tion is not based upon a superficial re- 
semblance, but upon the presence or 
absence of certain well-marked charac- 
ters. Were we justified in placing the 
genus &lt;Apiocera in the family asilidae 
it would become necessary to remove all 
of the therevidae to this family; but 
such a course is not at all desirable, as 
the family asilidae is already a very ex- 
tensive one, and the presence or absence 
of lips at the tip of the proboscis is a 
character of very easy application. 

There is not an entomologist living 
whose opinion on any subject relating 
to the diptera has greater weight than 
that of the Baron Osten Sacken; and I 
would not have ventured an opinion con- 
trary to one expressed by the Baron were 
I not convinced beyond a doubt of the cor- 
rectness of my own views. From the 
few words which he gives concerning the 
relationship of Apiocera to the therevidae 
it is quite evident that he had not com- 
pared them with the same care that he 
compared this genus with the asilina. 

The genus Apiocera is represented in 
my collection by twenty-two specimens, 
which were collected in this state (Cali- 
fornia) Some of the males agree in 
allessential characters with Osten Sack- 
en’s description of his A. haruspex, but 
the others ditfer to such a degree from 
these, and also from each other (there 
being scarcely any two specimens mark- 
ed exactly alike) that I am at a loss to 
know whether to regard them as belong- 
ing to several distinct species, or as 
merely varieties of one very variable 
species ; but I incline to the latter view 
of the case.

THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF MYRIOPODS AND ARACHNIDS. 


BY SAMUEL HUBBARD 


SCUDDER, 


CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 


Eighth annual address of the retiring president of the Cambridge Entomological Club. 
cS SF 8 Ss 


As the only subject of a general nature 
to which I have given recent attention I 
venture to invite you to review with me 
the geological history, first of myriopods 
Unusual atten- 
tion has recently been paid to these ani- 


and then of arachnids. 


mals, on account of the discovery of 
their remains in formations much ear- 
lier than those from which they had for 
along time been known, and the rela- 
tion of these discoveries to our previous 
knowledge will be best brought out by 
such a review, and it will, to a certain 
extent, be timely. 

Our knowledge of the morphology, 
systematic position and extent of the 
myriopoda has been greatly increased 
within a recent period. The discovery 
of the minute Pauropus by Lubbock, 
and the study of this and allied forms by 
Ryder and others, have led to the estab- 
lishment of the Jawropoda as a type of 
living myriopods of equal taxonomic 
value to the two groups of chzlopoda 
and d¢plopoda which had long been 
looked upon as the only divisions of the 
group. Modern investigations into the 
structure of the anomalous Perépacus 
have extended our ideas concerning the 
types allied to the myriopoda ; while the 
strange forms revealed by recent re- 
searches in the carboniferous and devon- 
ian faunas have compelled us to recog- 
nize a wider range in its structure and 
a multiplication of its primary groups. 
The relations of ancient to modern forms 
of life prove far more important and in- 


teresting in the myriopoda than in either

appear from a brief review of the struct- 
ure and development of the different 
groups. 

In the early life of the Pawropoda and 
of the d¢plopoda we have what may be 
fairly considered a true larval form, in 
which, for a brief period after leaving 
the egg, the body, much shorter than in 
after life, is provided with three pairs of 
legs borne upon the anterior segments 
of the body. 
more fully provided with legs, though 
most of the segments posterior to them, 


These segments are never 


both those which exist during this larval 
period and those which originate subse- 
quently, bear two pairs. In the chzlo- 
poda, on the other hand, although the 
appendages of the anterior segments de- 
velop eatlier than those behind them, 
there is no true larval condition, or 
perhaps one may say a larval condition 
is permanent, in that the same anterior 
legs become early and_ permanently 
developed as organs subsidiary to man- 
ducation, while the segments of the 
hinder part of the body develop only a 
single pair of legs. 

The resultant 
more or less highly developed metamor- 


larval condition and 
phosis of the higher hexapoda have been 
looked upon by many as a secondary 
after-development, and one which there- 
fore in no sense gives any clue to the 
historical development of the group, 


246 


such as we frequently find mirrored in 
the embryonic growth of other animals. 
This view seems to be supported by a 
comparison of the modern and ancient 
types of myriopoda. The larval charac- 
teristics of the young of living types of 
myriopoda, marvelously analogous in 
their main features to those of the larvae 
of even the higher hexapoda, are confined 
to the apodal nature of the abbreviated 
abdomen, and more particularly to the 
specialized development of appendages 
on the segments directly following the 
head. This specialized condition of the 
anterior segments is, in a sense, analo- 
gous to the structure of the thorax of the 
hexapoda and is persistent throughout 
life,—in the chzlofpoda in a marked 
manner, in the other groups by the 
isolation of these segments as bearing 
but a single pair of legs.

ponding in a measure to the living type 
of déplopoda, two pairs of legs are borne 
on every segment; while in the other, 
the protosyngnatha, corresponding in 
a similar way to the chz/opoda, a single 
pair of legs is found. If then we look 
upon the specialization of the segments 
(or the appendages of the segments) 
immediately following the head in living 
myriopodan types as a secondary devel- 
opment, or, we may say, as the initiatory 
stage in an acquiring metamorphosis ;

then we may perhaps consider the avchz- 
polypoda as the true prototypes of the 
diplopoda and possibly also of the 
pauropoda, and the protosyngnatha as 
the prototypes of the chz/opfoda. 

In this view, one principal distinction 
between the modern d/plopoda and 
chilopoda is shown to have existed 
from paleozoic times, viz: that in one 
group there are, over most of the body, 
to each dorsal scute two ventral scutes, 
each bearing a pair of legs; in the 
other group a single ventral scute with 
a single pair of legs; and it becomes 
interesting to inquire whether we can 
discover any indication of the condition 
of things from which this diversity of 
structures arose, and what was the line 
of development through which it passed. 
It will also help to determine the ques- 
tion, whether the dorsal or the ventral 
scutes of the dzAlopoda are to be looked 
upon as the homologs of those of the chz- 
lopoda ; or, in other words, whether the 
dorsal scutes of the d7p/opoda are com- 
pound, or the ventral scutes of the same 
are to be looked upon as subsegments. 

It should be remarked at the outset 
that what we know of the embryology 
of recent types shows that in the dplo- 
poda two pairs of legs, in the chélopoda 
one pair, arise from each original body

important and extensive than in the 
modern dplopoda, but some at least 
of the genera bore in addition to large 
stigmata outside the legs, a pair of seg- 
mental organs next the medioventral 
line on each ventral scute; the dorsal 
scute was also distinctly divided into two 
areas, an anterior anda posterior. In 
some types this latter distinction was 
more marked than in others, in some

conditions of preservation one would 
readily take them to be entirely sepa-

the embryology of modern types gives 
no hint, its earliest indications showing 
nothing anterior to what must have

This indicates that the present dorsal 
scutes of dz/plopoda are compound and 
formed of two originally distinct scutes ; 
and that, as a later development of a 
similar sort, the ventral scutes of the 
anterior segments have likewise con- 


solidated and lost each one pair of 
appendages.

from those of the devonian, and embrac-

far the greater number come from Amer-

Great Britain, with possibly a single 
species from Germany. Four species,

and the uncertain Geophilus proavus

probably to be looked upon as a nereid

The tertiary species are still known 
almost entirely from the work of Koch 
and Berendt, and belong entirely to the 
diplopoda and chilopoda, the larger pro- 
portion to the former. A few species, 
however, have been indicated from Aix, 
a single one described from the brown

a belief in our having reached the prim- 
ordial forms of this phylum in our 
retrograde search. 

When, in 1858, Bronn published his 
prize essay on the distribution of fossils, 
only two species of pretertiary arach- 
nida were known as such, one from the 
carboniferous and one from the juras- 
sic formation, and the knowledge of 
tertiary forms was confined entirely to 
the then recently published work of

species. The number is still exceedingly 
few — between 20 and 30 species — but 
it is being constantly extended, and the 
abundance of arthropoda brought to 
light in recent years in the carboniferous 
deposits of Allier, Bohemia, Scotland 
and Illinois leads us to expect an early 
and considerable extension of the list. 
This expectation is strengthened by 
Lindstrém’s and Hunter’s discoveries of 
scorpions in the upper Silurian rocks of 
Gotland and Scotland. 

The forms that have been found fossil 
in the earlier formations have proved, 
as might be expected, to belong mostly 
to those having a dense integument, 
and in the two species believed to be 
true araneae, the abdomen was proba-

in a fossil state, and these, so far as the 
indications have any meaning, invari-

they occur. This becomes more marked 
when we reach the tertiary rocks and

spiders belong, being now exclusively 
tropical.

arachnida in the different geological 
formations since their first appearance

with a tincture of litmus, shows a dis- 
tinct red color, or in other words has 
an acid reaction. It manifests this pe- 
culiarity because of the volatile formic

have furnished us an explanation of

the stingless honey-bees of South Amer-

‘known that never more than a very 
small store of honey is found in felled 
trees inhabited by stingless Melipona. 
What should induce the Melipona to 
accumulate stores which they could not 
preserve?! They lack formic acid. 
Only three of the eighteen different 
known species of honey-bees of northern 
Brazil have a sting. A peculiar phe- 
nomenon in the life of certain ants has 
always been problematical but now it 
finds also its least forced explanation. 
It is well known that there are different

that eight or twelve of them 
drag on one grain with the 


exertion. They travel in two separate 
ranks over smooth or rough ground, 


just as it comes, and even up and down 
steps, at the same regular pace. ‘They 
often have to travel with their booty 
more than a thousand metres, to reach 
their communal store-house. The re- 
nowned investigator Moggridge repeat- 
edly observed that when the ants were 
prevented from reaching their mag- 
azines of grain, the seeds began to 
sprout. The same was the case in 
abandoned magazines of grain. Hence 
the ants know how to prevent the sprout- 
ing of the grains, but the capacity for 
sprouting is not destroyed. The re- 
nowned English investigator John Lub- 
bock, who communicates this and sim- 
ilar facts in his work entitled ‘Ants, 
bees and wasps,” adds that it is not 
yet known in what way the ants pre- 


vent the sprouting of the collected 
grains. But now it is demonstrated 


that here also it is only the formic acid 
whose preservative influence goes so far 
that it can make seed incapable of ger- 
mination for a determinate time or, con- 
tinuously. 

It may be mentioned that we have 
also amongst us a species of ant which 
lives on seeds and stores these up. This 
is our Lasius niger, which carries seeds

of Viola into its nests, and, as Witt- 
mack has communicated recently to the 
Sitzungsberichte der gesellschaft natur- 
forschender freunde zu Berlin, does the 
same with the seeds of Verdnica hede- 
raefolia. 

Syke states in his account of an 
Indian ant, Pheidole providens, that 
this species collects a great store of 
grass-seeds. But he observed that the 
ants brought their store of grain into 
the open air to dry it after the monsoon 
storms. From this it appears that the 
preservative effect of the formic acid is 
destroyed by great moisture, and hence 
this drying process. So that amongst 
the bees the honey which is stored for 
winter use, and among the ants the 
stores of grain which serve for food, 
are preserved by one and the same fluid, 
formic acid. 


EDITORIAL NOTE. 


This same theory has been suggested 
many times by our most advanced Amer- 
ican bee keepers. It has been hinted 
that this same formic acid was what 
made honey a poison to many people, 
and that the sharp sting of some honey, 
notably that from bass wood or linden, 
originated in this acid from the poison 
sack. If this is the correct explanation, 
it seems strange that the same kind of 
honey is always peculiar for greater or 
less acidity as the case may be. We 
often see bees with sting extended 
and tipped with a tiny drop of poison ; 
but how do we know that this poison is 
certainly mingled with the honey? Is 


this any more than a guess? A. J. Coor.

PERMANENT MOUNTING OF 
TRACHEAE OF INSECTS. 


I have succeeded in a very simple way in 
mounting permanently the tracheal system 
of insects. I dissect out the soft parts and 
spread them on a glass slide of the usual 
size; let them dry perfectly; then with pen- 
cil-brush give them a good coating of collo- 
dion, after which I melt a little hard, pure 
balsam in a test tube and put it on the object 
with a cover glass applied at once. This is, 
so far as I know, a new method, It is re- 
markable for its results. The intestines, the 
ganglia, and the brain are perfectly magnifi- 
cent. The intestine makes thus one of the 
most beautiful objects for dark-ground illumi- 
nation. The brain shows the most abun- 
dant ramifications of the trachea, especially 
in the immense parallel branches in the rods 
of the eyes. The ganglia can be floated on 
a cover glass, dried, and mounted in this 
way. The entire process is simple and easy, 
and gives the most satisfactory results. 
There are many points of histological in- 
terest in the brain which are thus demon- 
strated.

pressed views as to the near affinity of these 
two forms, hitherto usually referred to differ- 
ent classes of the animal kingdom, and to 
justify the association of Limulus with the: 
arachnida. 

18 Dec. 1883.—...Dr. F. Leuthner read 
an abstract of a memoir which he had pre- 
pared on the odoxtolabini, a subfamily of the 
coleopterous family ducanédae, remarkable 
for the polymorphism of the males, while the 
females remained very similar. The males 
exhibit distinct 
phases of the development in their mandibles,

dont,” “amphiodont,” ‘‘mesodont,” and ‘‘telo- 
dont.”

by insensible gradations, and had been treated 
by the earlier authors as distinct species. 
The second part of the memoir contained a 
monograph of the three known genera which 
constitute the group odontolabini.... Mr. J. 
Wood-Mason, F.Z.S., read a paper on the 
embitdae, a little-known family of insects. 
on the structure and habits of which he had 
succeeded in making some 


memoir on the muscular 


systems of Limulus and

investigations 
during his recent residence in India. He 
came to the conclusion that the emdz¢dae un- 
doubtedly belong to the true orthoptera, and 
are one of the lowest terms of a series formed 
by the familiar acrrdéodea, locustidae, grylli- 
dae, and phasmatidae. 

1 Aprit 1884.—...Mr. F. D. Godman, 
F.R.S., read a paper containing an account 
of the lepidoptera collected by the late Mr. 
W. A. Forbes on the banks of the Lower 
Niger, the rhopalocera being described by 
Messrs. F. D. Godman and O. Salvin, and 
the heterocera by Mr. H. Druce. The species

of butterflies were fifty in number, and com- 
prised representatives of all the families of 
rhopalocera hitherto known from tropical 
Africa, except the eryctu¢dae, a group but 
feebly developed in this region.— Selected

LINNEAN Society oF Lonpon. 


21 Fes. 1884. — Mr. R. Miller Christy 
brought before the notice of the society a 
series of lepidoptera, hymenoptera, etc., cap- 
tured by him in Manitoba, some of the 
humble-bees being supposed new to science- 

20 Marcu 1884.—In illustration of his 
paper—‘‘A contribution to the knowledge of 
the genus Avapfhe Walker”’—Lord Walsing- 
ham exhibited a large and remarkable nest of 
a congregating moth, a species of the genus, 
from Natal. It contained a packed mass of 
cocoons, specimens of the larvae and of the 
mature insect; there likewise was shown a 
living example of a dipterous parasite which 
had emerged from the moth eggs... . 

3 AprRIL 1884.—...A paper was read by 
Mr. Francis J. Briant, On the anatomy and 
functions of the tongue of the bee (worker). 
The author, after referring to the structures of 
the more conspicuous parts of the endoskel- 
eton and relations of the tongue thereto. 
treats specially of the manner in which the 
bee takes up the honey by its tongue. It ap- 
pears that upon the nature and function of the 
organ in question authorities are by no means 
agreed. Kirby and Spence, supported by Hux- 
ley and partly Newport, aver that the bee sim- 
ply laps up its food; while Hermann Miiller 
and others rather attribute the action as due to 
the terminal whorl of hairs to which the 
honey adheres and therefrom is withdrawn 
inwards. The author of the paper on the 
other hand (from experiment and otherwise) 
is inclined to the view that the honey is drawn 
into the mouth through the inside of the 
tongue by means of a complicated pumping

action of the organ itself aided by the closely 
contiguous parts. 

6 Nov. 1884.—Mr. R. A. Rolfe exhibited 
and made remarks on examples of British 
oak galls produced by cynipidan insects of 
the genus Meuroterus, collected by him 
chiefly at Kew Gardens. He admitted that, 
as a rule, the plan and detail of the galls de- 
pend on the nature of the irritating fluid 
deposited by the insect; but at the same time 
the various species of oak have special influ- 
ence in determining color and often size of 
the galls. 

20 Nov. 1884.—A ‘paper was read, entitled 
‘‘Notes on the habits of some Australian hy- 
menoptera aculeata” by H. L. Roth. Therein 
he states that the wasps of the genus Pe/o- 
Poeus (P. laetus) build their nests on the 
walls, ceilings, legs of chairs, under tables, 
in cupboards, vases, between pictures and the 
walls, on curtains and in all sorts of crevices 
in the house, or on the roof. No place is safe 
from their intrusion. When a cell is com- 
pleted the wasp goes in search of spiders, and 
seizing these, packs their half dead bodies in 
the cell, lays an egg and closes the cell-top. 
Then afterwards rows of cells are added to 
the primary one and dealt with in the same 
fashion; generally finishing with a streaked 
coating of mud, to deceive as to the real con- 
tents beneath. Of the Australian ants For- 
mica rufintgra is both numerous, bold and 
destructive. They destroy the webs of cer- 
tain caterpillars and drive them out, to fall a 
prey to a host of attendant warrior ants. 

Mr. F. M. Campbell exhibited a dragon fly 
caught in September on the left bank of the 
Dordogne from a flight of dragon flies (odo- 
nata) which were taking a southeasterly di- 
rection; numbers were observed passing 
continuously for an hour and a half. He also 
drew attention to the steady progressive 
movement of a sphingid moth when placed 
on its back.— Selected from reports by J. 
Murie in Zoologischer anzetger.

PRESERVATION OF INSECTS.—To 
forms upon the pins 


remove 
the verdigris which 
the pinned insects should be immersed in 
benzine and left there for a time; several 
hours is generally long enough. The ad- 
ministration of this bath cannot be too 
highly recommended for beetles‘which have 
been rendered unrecognizable by grease, 
especially when dust has been mixed with 
the This immersion, of variable 
duration according to circumstances, will 
restore to these insects, however bad they 
have become, all their brilliancy and all 


their first freshness, and the efflorescences 


grease. 


of cupric oxide will not reappear. This 
preventative and curative method is also 
readily applicable to beetles glued upon 


paper which have become greasy: plunge 
them into benzine in the same way, and as 
gum is insoluble in the liquid, they remain 
fastened to their supports. Pruinose beetles, 
which are few in number, are the only ones 
that the benzine bath can alter; the others 
which are glabrous, pubescent, or scaly, can 
only gain by the process, and they will 
always make a good show in the collection

UpoN A PECULIAR ORIENTAL LOCALITY 
FOR HONEY.*— Xenophon, in his descrip- 
tion of the ‘‘Retreat of the ten thousand,” 
says that his soldiers drank barley wine, oinon 
kritys, as it had been introduced into Egypt 
by Osyris 4000 years previously, according to 
the Egyptian tradition, to take the place of 
other spirituous liquors. Sophocles and other 
writers mention this barley wine also. Xeno- 
phon says likewise that his soldiers were in 
the habit of getting drunk by the use of a 
certain kind of honey, and were poisoned by 
it. It seems that the bees suck the nectar 
from the flowers of poisonous plants which 
are found in that region. Such an intoxicat- 
ing, soporific honey is still found there under 
the name of Meli menomenon. I have suc- 
ceeded by many tedious investigations in es- 
tablishing the following. I obtained the in- 
formation principally through a former pupil 
of mine who is now settled in Kerchasund in 
Persia as a physician and apothecary. 


* Translated from Prof. Dr. Xaver Landerer’s “Mit- 
theilungen aus dem orient” (Deutsch-amer. apotheker- 
zeitung, 15 Dec. 1882, jahrg. 3, p. 582). 


January—March 1885.} 


I have already reported to you upon the 
oriental mania for opium. But the opium 
which is produced for the western countries 
and for China is very little in comparison 
with the domestic consumption. In the dis- 
tricts around Erzeroum, around Kerchasund 
and farther into the Persian districts are to 
be found colossal plantations, whose product 
is almost exclusively used where produced. 

In all probability it is the nectar of these 
poppy plants which gives the honey in those 
regions its toxic qualities. 

This honey is used as asoporific for children 
and is employed also against various aftec- 
tions, especially such as arise from improper 
food—sour milk, badly cooked rice, goat’s 
milk, etc.—as for instance colic, and often is of 
aid where symptoms of death have already 
appeared. 

The opium which is collected from the 
poppy plants in those regions contains usual- 
ly 12 per cent. and rarely less than ro per cent. 
of morphium. I had an opportunity to see 
such opium in the possession of a Persian 
merchant. It consisted of round balls of a 
few drachms weight which were wrapped in 
goldleaf. This is the kind which is used 
principally for smoking and chewing. 

PUPAL RETREAT OF CHARAGIA VIRES- 
cens.—Mr. G: Vernon Hudson, in an article 
in the Extomologis¢ for February 1885, en- 
titled ‘‘Life-history of Charagta virescens,” 
gives some interesting observations in regard 
to the habits of this bombycid from New 
Zealand. The larva bores in the wood of 
living trees, often in that of Ar¢stotelia ra- 
cemosa (New Zealand currant), Olea apetala 
(black maize) and Leptospermum (manuka). 
When ready to pupate the larva constructs a 
complicate tunnel, described as follows. ‘‘It 
consists of a Spacious, irregular, but shallow, 
cavity just under the bark, having a large 
opening to the air, which is entirely closed 
with a thin silken covering almost exactly 
the same shape and size as the numerous 
scars which occur at intervals up the trunks 
of nearly all the trees. Three large tunnels 


PSUiCLH PE. 


267 


open into this shaliow cavity; one in the 
centre, which runs into the middle of the 
stem ; and one on each side, which run right 
and left just under the bark. These are 
usually very short, but sometimes extend 
half-way round the tree, and occasionally 
even join one another on the opposite side. 
The central tunnel has a slightly upward 
direction for a short distance inwards, which 
effectually prevents it from becoming flooded 
with water; afterwards it pursues an almost 
horizontal course until it reaches the centre 
of the tree, when it appears to suddenly 
terminate. This, however, is not the case, 
for, if the gallery floor is carefully examined 
a short distance before its apparent termina- 
tion, a round trap-door will be found com- 
pactly constructed of very hard, smooth silk, 
corresponding with the surrounding portion 
of the tunnel so exactly that it almostescapes 
detection. When this lid is removed a long 
perpendicular shaft is disclosed, which runs 
down the middle of the tree to a depth of 
fourteen or sixteen inches [35-40 cm.], 
and is about six lines [13 mm.] in di- 
ameter; at the bottom of this the elongate 
virescens pupa sleeps quietly and securely 
in an upright position, the old larval skin 
forming a soft support for the terminal seg- 
ment of the pupa to rest on. The upper 
end of this vertical shaft is lined with silk, 
which forms a framework on which the trap- 
door rests when it is closed: the lid itself, 
being of a larger size than the orifice, which 
it covers, causes it to be extremely difficult, 
if not impossible, to open it from the ex- 
terior, especially when it fits down very 
closely, which is nearly always the case as 
longas the insect remains in its burrow. The 
object of this most ingenious contrivance is in 
all probability, to prevent the ingress of 
insects; blattae, siugs, spiders, and imma- 
ture ‘wetas’ (Hemddeina) are frequently 
found in both central and lateral tunnels, 
but they are quite unable to pass the trap- 
door, and are most likely entirely ignorant

METAMORPHOSES OF ARCTIC INSECTS. In 
the chapter entitled, “‘Das insektenleben in 
arktischen landern,” which Dr. Christopher 
Aurivillius contributes to the account of A. E. 
Nordenskiéld’s arctic investigations, pub- 
lished this year in Leipzig,* the author says: 
“The question of the mode of life of insects 
and of its relation to their environment in 
the extreme north is one of especial interest. 
Knowing, as we do, that any insect in the 
extreme north has at the most not more than 
from four to six weeks in each year for its 
development, we wonder how certain species 
can pass through their whole metamorphosis 
in so short a period. R. McLachlan adverts, 
in his work upon the insects of Grinnell 
Land, to the difficulties which the shortness 
of the summer appears to put in the way of 
the development of the insects, and expresses 
the belief that the metamorphosis which we 
are accustomed here to see passed through 
in one summer there requires several sum- 
mers. The correctness of this supposition 
has been completely shown by the interest- 
ing observations which G. Sandberg has 
made upon species of lepidoptera in South 
Varanger, at 69° 40! north latitude. Sand- 
berg succeeded in following the develop- 
ment from the egg onward of some species 
of the extreme north. O6cnezs bore, Schn., 
a purely arctic butterfly, may be taken gs an 
example. This species never has been found 
outside of arctic regions and even there 
occurs only in places of purely arctic stamp. 
It flies from the middle of June onward, and 
lays its eggs on different species of grass. 
The eggs hatch the same summer; the larva 
hibernates under ground, continues eating 
and growing the next summer, and does not 
even then reach its full development, but 
winters a second time and pupates the fol- 
lowing spring. The pupa, which in closely- 
related forms, in regions further to the south,

is suspended free in the air upon a blade of 
grass or like object, is in this case made in 
the ground, which must be a very advanta- 
geous habit in so raw aclimate. The imago 
leaves the pupa after from five to six weeks, 
an uncommonly long period for a butterfly. 
In more southern regions the butterfly pupa 
rests not more than fourteen days in summer. 
The entire development, then, takes place 
much more slowly than it does in regions 
further south. Sandberg has shown, then, 
by this and other observations, that the 
arctic summer, even at 70° N., 1s not suffi- 
cient for the development of many butterflies, 
but that they make use of two or more sum- 
mers for it. If then more than one summer 
is requisite for the metamorphosis of the 
butterflies, it appears to me still more likely 
that the humble-bees need more than one 
summer for their metamorphosis. With us 
only the developed female lives over from 
one year to the next; in spring she builds 
the new nest, lays eggs, and rears the larvae 
which develop into workers who immediately 
begin to help in the support of the family; 
finally, toward autumn, males and females 
are developed. It seems scarcely credible 
that all this can take place each summer -in 
the same way in Grinnell Land, at 82° N., 
especially as the access to food must be more 
limited than it is with us. The development 
of the humble-bee’ colony must surely be 
quite different there. If it was not surely 
proved that humble-bees occur at so high 
latitudes, one would not, with a knowledge 
of their mode of life, be inclined to believe 
that they could live under such conditions. 
They seem, however, to have one advantage 
over their relatives in the south. In the 
arctic regions none of those parasites are 
found which in other regions lessen their 
numbers, such as the conopfidae among the 
flies, the mutillas among the hymenoptera, 
and others.”

(Concluded from p 243.) 


Amphidasys cognataria Guenée (Hist. nat. 
d. ins., 1857, v- 9, Uran. et phal., v. 1, p. 208). 
Cramer (Bull. Brooklyn entom. soc., Aug. 
1883, v. 6, p. 48) briefly describes the eggs of 
this species, of which about five hundred 
were deposited 3 June. Bowles (Can. entom., 
April 1871, v. 3, p. 11-12) (Ann. rept. Entom. 
soc. Ontario, 1871, p. 38-39) describes a vari- 
ety of the larva which fed on ‘‘black currant” 
[Rebes 2nigrum],and Goodell (of. c¢t., April 
1878, v. 10, p. 67) describes another variety 
which fed on apple and pear. Lintner (En- 
tom. contrib., no. 3, 1874, p. 166) briefly de- 
scribes the larva, giving Acer as food-plant, 
and Packard (Guide study ins., 1869, p. 322) 
gives a few notes on the larva, which he states 
feeds upon Ribes aureum, R. 2grossularia, 
and Sfiraea ?tomentosa. Pilate (Papilio, 
May 1882, v. 2, p. 71) gives ‘‘honey-locust” 
( Gleditschia triacanthos) as food-plant. 
Lintner (Entom. contrib. [no. 1], 1869, p. 
64) gives plum as food-plant. To the above 
food-plants may be added Betula alba, B. 
lenta, Castanea vesca, Salix, and Spiraea 
sorbéfolia.

The larva varies from pea-green 


general color; 
form is from /zbes, Salix and Spcraea, while 


as far as noticed the green 


those from apple exhibit all the color varia- 
tions; on Betula and Castanea the larvae are 
grey. Similar variations have been noticed 
in the larvae of Amphidasys betularia, a 
European species. The larvae often rest in 
a partially twisted position, with their rigid 
bodies at a considerable angle from the stem 
to which they cling, thus imitating very 
closely twigs and petioles. The larvae are 
common in New England in July and August; 


they pupate from the latter part of July to 


September, the pupa hibernating under 
leaves and rubbish. 
Cymatophora crepuscularia Treits 


(Schmett. v. Europa, 1827, v. 6, pt. 1, 
p- 190). Goodell (Can. entom., Apr. 1878, 
v. 10, p. 67) has described the larva of this 
species from a single taken on

this very variable larva has often been reared. 
Herr (Anleitung d. schmett. u. raupen,... 
1833, pt. 2, p- 272) gives a good description 
of the larva, and states that its food-plants 
are Aguilegia, Salix, Populus, Alnus, Ulmus, 
Spartium,and Sambucus. Kaltenbach (Pflan- 
zenfeinde, 1872, p. 614-615) writes ‘‘A very 
common geometrid whose larva is very dif- 
ferently marked according to its food-plant. 
On Salix Borkhausen found it brownish- 
green, on Italian poplar grey-green, on Alnus 
brownish-grey, on Udmus lighter green than 
on Salix, on Sambucus grey-brown, etc. 
Treitschke’s specimens reared on plum were 
Pupation takes place under the 
ground; the moth appears in two genera- 
tions, in spring from hybernated pupae and 
again in July. The larvae appear in June 
and in September.” Kaltenbach (of. c7¢., p. 
110, 234, 302, and 435) adds the following to 
previously mentioned food-plants: Betula 
alba, Genista, Quercus, Rubus, Lonicera,

imago the next spring; another pupated 
Sept. and died later, and the third pupated 
Sept. and the imago appeared 28 Sept. of the 
same year. Two annual broods of larvae are 
therefore probable in New England, as in 
Germany, but part of the second brood ap- 
parently emerge and oviposit in late autumn, 
while the rest hibernate as pupae. 

Paraphia subatomaria Guenée (Hist. nat. 
d. ins., 1857, v. 9, Uran. et Phal., v. 1, p. 272). 
A larva taken on Betula alba, at Belmont, 
Mass., 12 Aug. 1882, pupated 19 Sept. and a 
male imago emerged 8 Oct. 1882. This larva 
was mistaken fora young larva of Cymazo- 
phora crepuscularia. Another larva, taken 
on the same species of plant, at Cambridge, 
Mass., 10 Sept. 1882, pupated 27 Sept. and 
produced a female imago 28 Oct. 1882. A 
third larva taken in Cambridge, on the same 
plant in the fall of 1883, pupated, and would 
have hibernated as pupa had it not been kept 
in a warm room; the moth emerged during 
the winter. Packard (Mon. geom. moths 
U. S., 1876, p. 418) writes ‘‘The moth has 
been raised by Mr. W. Saunders, of London, 
Canada, from a ‘brown geometric larva on 
the pine, the imago appearing June 24th’.” 

Ephyra pendulinaria Guenée (Hist. nat. 
d. ins., 1857, v- 9, Uran. et phal., v. 1, p. 414). 
Packard (Mon. geom. moths U. S., 1876, p. 
363-364) gives a description, by S. H. Scud- 
der, of the larva and pupa of this species; 
the larva fed on Comptonta asplenifolia. A 
larva of this species, taken on Betula alba, 
at Wachusett, Mass., 26 Aug. 1882, pupated 
28 Aug., and the imago appeared 14 May 1883. 

Anagoga pulverarta Linn. (Syst. nat., 
1758, ed. ro, p. 521). Herr (Anleitung d. 
raupen d. deutsch. schmett., 1833, p. 284) de- 
scribes larva and pupa, and gives Salix caprea 
as food-plant of this species. Kaltenbach 
(Pflanzenfeinde, 1872, p. 571 and 598) gives 
Salix and Betula as food-plants. Packard 
(Mon. geom. moths, 1876, p. 488-489) quotes 
Merryfield’s description of the larva, and 
states, on authority of Goodell, that the larva 
is found on Corylus.

Endropia armatarta Herrich-Schaefter 
(Samml. neuer od. wenig bekannter ausser- 
eur. schmett., 1850-1858, pl. 65, fig. 373-374)- 
Saunders (Can. entom., Oct. 1871, v. 3, p- 
130-131) (Ann. rept. Entom. soc. Ontario, 
1871, p. 38) describes the larva of this species 
which he found on species of /tzbes. A fe- 
male of this species taken 15 June 1883, in 
Cambridge, Mass., was confined over fresh 
twigs of Acer, Ribes rubrum and FR. aureum. 
On 18 June she laid two rows of elongated, 
flattened eggs upon a leaf of Acer; their color 
was light green, but by 20 June they had be- 
come shining carmin-red, which later be- 
came dull-red. The eggs were 0.7 mm. long, 
0.5 mm. wide and o.4 mm. high, and were 
placed closely side by side in rows, and 
gummed to the leaf. They hatched 27 June. 
The larvae would not readily eat leaves of 
Zibes, but ate, inorder of preference, leaves 
of Betula alba, of Acer, and of apple. One 
pupated 2 Aug. 1883 and the imago appeared 
19 Aug. 1883; the second pupation occurred 
6 Aug. 1883, but the imago did not appear 
until 3 June 1884; two more pupated 17 Aug. 
1883, both of which produced imagos about 
7 June 1884. In this case, of the four larvae 
which succeeded in producing imagos, all 
were subjected as nearly as possible to equal 
conditions, being reared in the same jar, 
upon the same plants, which were kept fresh 
with their stems in water, yet one of the im- 
agos appeared the same fall, only seventeen 
days after pupation, while the three others 
remained about ten months in the pupal 
state. Those reared by Mr. Saunders hiber- 
nated as pupae. 

ELugonia alniaria Linn. (Syst. nat., 1758, 
ed. 10, p. 519) [= E. magnaria Guenée]. 
The eggs of this species are flattened, oblong, 
1.1mm. long, 0.6 mm. wide, and 0.5 mm. high. 
They are of a greenish-brown, somewhat 
polished bronze color, and when laid upon 
a smooth surface are arranged side by side in 
a curve having the length of the abdomen of 
the female moth for its radius. When laid 
upon bark and rough surfaces the eggs are in

broken, short rows. A single female deposits 
five hundred to six hundred eggs.  Oviposi- 
tion takes place in September and October, 
and the eggs hatch in May and June, hiber- 
nation taking place in the egg state, as is the 
case with some other species of geometridae. 
Hellins (Entom. mo. mag., Mar. 1870, v. 6, 
p- 222) gives similar dates for oviposition and 
hatching in England. ‘The larva and pupa 
are described by Herr (Anleitung d. raupen, 
d. deutschen schmett., 1833, p. 258) who enum- 
erates the following food-plants: Betula, Al- 
Corylus avellana, Carpinus betulus, 
Ulmus, apple, pear, stone-fruit, and Z7a. 
Herold (Teutscher raupenkalender, 1845, p- 
135) gives Fagus in addition to the above- 
mentioned trees. Harris (Entom. corresp., 
1869, p. 320) gives notes on different stages 
of this species. Kaltenbach (Pflanzenfeinde, 
1872, p. 89, 218, and 552) adds Acer, Fosa 
and Populus as food-plants. Lintner (Entom. 
contrib., no. 3, 1874, p. 165), in a note on 
Eugonia magnarta, gives Syringa vulgaris 
as food-plant. Packard (Mon. geom. moths, 
1876, p. 530) quotes descriptions of larva and 
pupa by Goodell and by Scudder; the former 
entomologist gives Castanea vesca, and the 
latter Betula lenta as food-plant.  Rotiast 
(Annales Soe. linn. de Lyon, ann. 1882,| 1883], 
v. 29, p- 340) adds Quercus robur to the food- 
plants. Packard (Bull. no. 7, U.S. entom. 
comm., 1851, p. 92) repeats Goodell’s descrip- 
tion of the larva and pupa, adds one of the 
moth, and further remarks that Scudder’s de- 
scription ‘tis so different from Mr. Goodell’s 
that I fear it refers to a different insect.” This 
is not, however, the case, but the larva is 
very variable in coloration. Worthington 
(Can. entom., Jan. 1878, v. 10, p. 16) writes, 
“This larva evidently changes its color some- 
what with different food, as these [larvae] 
closely resemble the bark of this tree 
[maple].” The general coloration may vary 
to match that of the bark of the tree on 
which the larvae feed, but the head, which is 
the part of the larva that varies most, is slate- 
grey, green, or dull red in specimens taken

from maple. These larvae, having molted at 
least four (probably five) times, pupate from 
the latter part of July to the end of Septem- 
ber; the pupal state lasts from eighteen to 
twenty days, the imagos flying from the 
middle of September until the last of October 
in New England. The larvae are not rare 
upon Betula alba and B. lutea. 

Catocala relicta Walk. (List lep. ins. Brit. 
mus., 1857, pt. 13, p. 1192-1193.) Bunker 
(Can. entom., May 1883, v. 15, p. 100) states 
that Populus is the favorite food-plant of the 
larva of this species. Hulst (Bull. Brooklyn 
entom. soc., July 1884, v. 7, p. 48) says 
““Food-plant, white birch and silver poplar; 
and probably all species of Betula and Popu- 
lus.” The same author (é. c., June 1884, v. 7, 
p- 15-16) gives structural characters and 
habits of the larvae of Catocala. The Euro- 
pean C. fraxtn?, regarded by some authors 
to be a synonym of C. redicta, feeds, as larva, 
on Populus, Betula, Acer, Ulmus, Quercus, 
and Fraxtnus. C. relicta has been reared by 
G: Dimmock, in Springfield, Mass., from a 
full-grown larva taken under circumstances 
which made it almost certain that its food- 
plant was Acer. 

Brephos infans Moschler (Wien. entom. 
monatsschr., Mar. 1862, v. 6, p. 134-136, pl. 1, 
fig. 6). Harris (Entom. corresp., 1869, pl. 1, 
fig. 4) figures the imago of this species. 
Lintner (Entom. contrib., no. 4, £878, p. 227- 
229) gives notes upon the habits of the imago 
which render it almost certain that the larva 
feeds upon Betula. The larvae of the Euro- 
pean species of this genus feed upon Betula 
alba, the larva of Brephos Parthenias living 
between leaves that it spins together upon 
high twigs. The imagos of B. ¢xfans are 
not rare about Betula alba, extremely early 
in the spring, both in eastern and western 
Massachusetts. 

Orthosia tnstabilis Fabr. (Entom. syst., 
1793, V- 3, p- 119) [= Zaenzocampa incerta 
Hiibn.]. Kaltenbach (Pflanzenfeinde, 1872, 
P 429-430, 550, 640) gives the following food- 
plants for the larva of this species in Europe: 


274 


Apple, Ulmus, Tilta, Salix, Quercus, Fraxt- 
nus, Betula alba, Populus and Carfinus; to 
this list Roiiast (Annales Soc. linn. Lyon, 
ann. 1882, [1883], n. s., v. 29, p. 315-316) adds 
Amygdalus communts, Crataegus oxyacantha, 
and Centaurea jacea. ; 

Apatela xylintformis Guen. (Hist. nat. d. 
ins., 1852, v. 5, Noct., v. 1, p. 56). Thaxter 
(Papilio, Jan. 1883, v. 3, p. 17) states that the 
larva of this species feeds on Getu/a and 
blackberry [Rudus]. 

Apatela brumosa Guen. (Hist. nat. d. ins., 
1852, v- 5, Noct., v. 1, p. 52). Thaxter (Pa- 
pilio, Jan. 1883, v. 3, p. 17) states that the 
larva of this species feeds on Betula, Salix, 
and Populus. 

Apatela dactylina Grote (Proc. Bost. soc. 
nat. hist., April 1874, v. 16, p. 239). Thaxter 
(Psyche, May-June [g July] 1877, v. 2, p. 35) 
gives Betula and Salx as food-plants of the 
larva of this species. 

Apatela americana Harr. (Rept. ins. injur. 
veg., 1841, p. 317). Harris (of. cét., p. 317- 
31S) describes the larva and cocoon of this 
species: he writes, ‘‘ The caterpillar eats the 
leaves of the various kinds of maple and 
sometimes also those of the elm and chest- 
nut.” The same author (Treatise on ins. 
injur. veg., 1862, p. 436-437) figures larva, 
pupa, and imago of this species and adds 
Tilia to the food-plants; and (Entom. cor- 
resp., 1869, p. 311) again describes the larva. 
In Amer. entom., April 1869, v. 1, p. 166, this 
species is stated to feed on Populus dilatata 
and P. monilifera, and Riley (2nd rept. state 
entom. Mo., 1870, p. 121) gives Betula and 
Alnus as food-plants. Coquillett (Papilio, 
Jan. 1881, v. 1, p. 6) describes the larva, and 
gives red oak (Quercus) as food-piant. Thax- 
ter (Papilio, Jan. 1883, v. 3, p. 17) adds Fu- 
glans, Fraxinus and Platanus to the recorded 
food-plants. 

Apatela vulpina Grote (Can. entom., Jan. 
1883, v. 15, p. 8-9). Thaxter (Papilio, Jan. 
1883. v. 3, p. 14-15) describes the larva of this 
species, and gives Populus and Betula as 
food-plants.

the larva and imago. Harris (Treatise on 
ins. injur. veg., 1862, p. 405-406) figures and 
describes larva, pupa, andimago, and (Entom.

that the larva eats raspberry [/twdus sp.]. 
Lintner (Entom. contrib., no. 2, 1872, p. 51-

which, he writes, has four molts (five stages), 
and feeds on Quercus prinoides. Packard 
(Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, p. 45) 
briefly describes the larva, and gives a few 
notes upon its habits. The larva feeds on 
Betula alba.

brooded in the south. The food-plants, as 
compiled, in chronological order, from the 
above and from other notices of this species 
are as follows: Populus balsamifera, Ulmus, 
Trifolium, Zea mays, and, according to Ab-

notices some color-varieties of the imago. 
Gentry (Can. entom., March 1877, v- 9, p- 
41-49) describes the egg, different stages of 
the larva, and cocoon. Grote (Can. entom., 
Sept. 1878, v. 10, p. 176) says this species is 
double-brooded in the southern United States. 
Packard (Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, 
p- 113) figures the larva. Neumoegen (Pa- 
pilio, Jan. 1882, v. 2, p. 18) states that this 
species usually emerges from the pupal state 
at about 5 p.m.; Brodie (of. czt., May 1882, 
v. 2, p. §3), on the contrary, states that the 
emergence normally takes place about 10 a.m. 
Riley and others state that the larva has five 
stages, but Wailly (Bull. Soc. acclim. France, 
May 1882, s. 3, v. 9, p- 266-267) writes that 
it has six stages. Brodie (Papilio, Feb. 1882, 
vy. 2, p- 32-33) gives a list of 49 species of 
plants belonging to 20 genera on which the 
larva will feed: the genera are 77lia, Acer, 
Negundo, Prunus. Spiraea, Crataegus, Py- 
rus, Amelanchier, Ribes, Sambucus, Ulmus, 
Quercus, Fagus, Corylus, Carpinus, Betula,

Attecus polyphemus Fabr. (Species in- 
sector., 1781, v. 2, p. 168). Among the very 
numerous articles which have been published 
concerning this species the following are 
worthy of citation. Harris (Rept. ins. injur. 
veg., 1841, p. 278-279) describes larva, cocoon 
and imago; later (‘Treatise on ins. injur. veg., 
1862, p. 384-386) he adds a figure of the im-

nop. lepid. N. A., 1862, p. 226-227) describes 
larva and imago, and (of. c/t., p. 209) de- 
scribes the egg, which he mistook for that of 
Smerinthus excaecatus. Trouvelot (Amer.

that there are six larval stages, Riley gives 
the number of molts as four, making five

normal form anda variety of the larva. Grote 
(Can. entom., Sept. 1878, v. 10, p. 176) states 
that this species is double-brooded in the 
south; Trouvelot (Z. c.) was unable to raise 
two broods to maturity in Massachusetts, and 
Brodie (Papilio, April 1882, v. 2, p. 60) writes 
that, ‘tin long and warm seasons about 50 
per cent. are double brooded, but this is 
against the increase of the species, as cold 
weather usually sets in before the larvae are 
fully matured.” . Packard (Bull. 7, U.S. en- 
tom. comm., 1881, p. 48) figures the larva. 
Saunders (Can. entom., March 1882, v. 14,

fying the food-plants as Carya porcina and 
Fuglans cinerea. Morris (Synop. lepid. N.

Liquidambar, Fagus, Betula, Salix, and 
plum. Lintner (Entom. contrib.. no. 3, 1874, 
p-. 126-128) describes the larva, which molts 
four times. Gentry (Can. entom., May 1874, 
v. 6, p. 86) describes the normal form of the 
larva, and a variety of it. Bunker (Can.

American species of Platyfteryx?, and Pack- 
ard (Guide study ins., 1869, p. 293) repeats 
this figure as that of a species of Dryofterés; 
no food-plant is mentioned by either author. 
The European species, Platyftervx lacertula, 
feeds on birch. The larva of P. dfltneata is 
found upon Betula alba, in eastern Massa- 
chusetts, about the first of July and again 
early in September; hibernation takes place 
as pupa in the September brood. Dr. G: 
Dimmock will later describe the egg, larva 
and pupa of this insect in detail, but the fol- 


lowing hotes will suffice for the recognition 
of the Irva and pupa. The full-zrown larva 
is about 12 mm. long, tapering from the an- 
terior to the posterior end, which latter term- 
inates in a single point, turned upward, in 
place of the anal legs. The dorsal surface of 
each segment bears four tubercles, each sup-

Harris (Rept. ins. injur. veg., 1841, p. 306-307) 
describes the larva of this species and gives 
as food-plants plum and apple, and adds to 
them, on authority of Abbot, Przvzos vert- 
cillatus. Vlarris (Entom. corresp., 1869, pl. 
2, fig. 8) gives a colored figure of the larva. 
Payne (Amer. entom., Oct. 1870, v. 2, p. 341) 
notes that the larva mimics partly dead and 
partly living margins of leaves. Lintner (En- 
“tom. contrib., no. 3, 1874, p- 131) describes 
and figures the larva, adding Corylus amert- 
cana and Prunus virginiana to the previously 
known food-plants; his figure is copied in 
Amer. nat., Nov. 1874, v. 8, p. 691-692. Pack-

plum, ftosa and Crataegus; this description 
is quoted by Morris (Synop. lepid. N. A., 
1862, p- 242), and is repeated with figures of 
larva and imago (Treatise on ins. injur. veg., 
1862, p. 425-426, pl. 6, fig. 11) and with a 
colored figure of the larva by Harris (Entom.

(Amer. entom., Sept.-Oct., 1869, v. 2, p. 27) 
figures larva. pupa, and imago, and adds pear 
to the food-plants; Riley’s figures are re- 
peated by Saunders (Can. entom., July 1881,

“Entom. soc. Phil., 1866, v. 6, p. 11-12) de- 
scribe the imago and the larva with especial 
reference to distinguishing it from the larvae 
of other species of Datana. Harris (/.c.)

of the food plants of larvae of species of 
Datana, add, for D. Quercus, 
Corylus, Carya, Crataegus, Robinia, Betu-

are, at least in eastern Massachusetts, very 
often nearly all destroyed by a minute hy- 
menopterous parasite.

the species as larva. which he states to live 
on Fuglans; later (Entom. corresp., 1869, p- 
300, pl. 3, fig. 8) he figures the larva, and 
adds apple to the food-plants. Walsh (Proc. 
Bost. soc. nat. hist., Feb. 1864, v. 9, p. 298- 
299) first describes the imago and says, ‘“‘The 
larva fed on hickory leaves, but I have met 
with two specimens on the button-wood or

imago, figuring the last. A single larva of 
this species, taken on Betula alba at Bel- 
mont, Mass, 12 Aug. 1882, pupated 17 Sept., 
and emerged 1 July 1883. The excrement 
of the larva has a peculiar form, being cup- 
shaped, with a deep concavity, and com- 
paratively thin walls which are somewhat 
shrivelled about the margin in drying. The 
larva, when disturbed, exhales an odor diffi- 
cult to describe. A short time before pupa- 
tion it turns whitish.

Harris (Rept. ins. injur. veg., 1841, p. 3047 
305) describes the larva and imago of this 
species, stating that the larva feeds on oak, 
and, according to Melsheimer, on wild cher- 
ry; later (Treatise on ins. injur. veg., 1862, 
p- 421-422) he adds to this description a poor 
figure of the larva and of the cocoon; he 
gives a brief note (Entom. corresp., 1869, p. 
244-245) on the larva. Riley (Amer. entom. 
v. 2: Sept.-Oct. 1869, p. 25; Oct. 1870, p. 340) 
gives a good figure of the larva, which he 
states to feed on apple and Siberian crab- 
apple; he later (5th ann. rept. state entom. 
Mo., 1873, p. 126) gives this species in a list 
of larvae which have urticating power. Lint- 
ner (Entom. contrib., no. 3, 1874, p- 149) 
describes the cocoon, and adds plum, pear, 
and Corylus americana to the food-plants. 
This larva is rarely found in eastern Massa- 
chusetts and a little more abundant in the 
western part of the state; a faverite food- 
plant is Betula alba.

July [Dec.] 1882, y. 3, p. 368) describes egg 
and first larval stage of this species. Flet- 
cher (Can. entom., Nov. 1883, v. 15, p. 203-

cherry, Populus balsamtfera and P. alba, and 
further states that the larvae varied much in 
coloration. Saunders (Can. entom., Jan. 
1884, v. 16, p. 9-11) describes and figures the 
last stage of the larva andthe imago. Fischer 
(op. ctt., p. 17) adds Telia and Salix to the 
food-plants. In Cambridge, Mass., the larva 
of this species is not rare on low shrubs of 
Betula alba, where it occurs throughout Au- 
gustand September. The larvae, as observed 
on Betula alba, exhibit no variation. They 
are somewhat difficult to rear; of 38 larvae, 
of which rearing was begun, 8 were putin

of Thyreodon produced a large number of 
minute hymenoptera — secondary parasites.

The egg of S. excaecatus often harbors very 
minute hymenopterous parasites; more than 
thirty of these hymenoptera sometimesemerge 
from a single egg of Smerinthus, a fact that 
will give an idea of their microscopical mi- 
nuteness.

agric. soc., 1858, v. 18, p. 853). Packard 
(Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, p. 128) 
briefly describes this beetle. 

Tylonotus bimaculatus Hald. (Trans. Amer.

Packard (Bull. 7, U. S. entom. comm., 1881, 
p- 129) on authority of G: Hunt, to be found 
“Under bark of white or paper birch, north- 
ern New York.” 

Gracilia minuta Fabr. (Spec. ins., 1781, v.

from a band of wood (Betula lenta) around a 
gin-barrel. 

Bellamtra scalaris Say (Journ. acad. nat

pupa 8 July 1874. 

Meracantha contracta Beauy. (Ins. Afr. et

man (Proc. Amer. assoc. advance. sci., 1850, 
v. 2, p- 347) briefly notices the larva of this 
species. Specimens in the collection of G: 
Dimmock were taken at Suffield, Conn., by 
Leroy H. Sykes, in decaying bark of Betula 
lutea. 

Bolitotherus bifurcus Fabr. (Entom. syst., 
Suppl., 1794, p. 40). The larvae, pupae and 
imagos of this species are found in Polyporus 
betulinus, which grows on dead birch trees. 
Larva, pupa, and a male imago are figured 
by Packard (Guide study ins., 1869, p. 474). 
Kirby, as quoted by Bethune (Can. entom., 
Nov. 1873, v- 5, p- 211), says that this species 
is found in a boletus of the birch. Some 
habits of this beetle are mentioned by Har- 
rington (Can. entom., Dec. 1882, v. 12, p. 
260-261). Candéze (Mém. soc. sci. Liége, 
1861, v. 16, p. 365-368, pl. 3, fig. 9) givesa 
detailed description of the larva, with figure; 
and Hayward (Bull. Bost. zool. soc., July 
1882, v. I, p. 35-36) briefly describes the larva 
and pupa. 

Hoplocephala bicornis Fabr. (Gen. ins. 
mant., 1777, p- 215). This insect feeds upon 
different kinds of fungi, some of them para- 
sitic on decaying wood of Betula. Kirby’s 
description of the imago is quoted by Bethune 
(Can. entom., Nov. 1873, v. 5, p. 210-211). 
Harrington (2. c., Dec. 1880, v. 12, p. 261) 
mentions its fungivorous habits. 

Diaperis hydni Fabr. (Syst. eleuth., 1801, 
v. 2, p. 585). This species, both as larva and 
imago, feeds upon Polyporus betulinus, a 
fungus that grows on dead trees of Betula 
alba, and the beetles, according to G: Dim- 
mock, are often very abundant about the first 
of July. Harrington (Can. entom., Dec. 188o, 
v. 12, p. 261) briefly describes the imago.

species has been found by G: Dimmock, on 
Mt. Washington, N. H., in Polyporus betult- 
nus, the large white fungus common on dead 
trees of Betula alba. ‘The imago frequents 
the same fungus during June, July, and Au-

(ist anv. rept. inj. and benefic. ins. Mass., 
1871, p. 26-28, pl. 1, fig. 7-8) describes and 
figures larva and imago and writes that the 
pupa of this species ‘‘early in May becomes 
a beetle, when it eats the newly expanded 
leaves of the birch.” Riley (4th ann. rept. 
state entom. Mo., 1872, p. 29-30) describes and 
figures the larva and imago, stating that the 
larva has been found to eat larvae of Carfo- 
capsa pomonella. 

Campylus denticornis Kirby (Fauna bor.- 
amer., 1837, pt. 4, p- 145). G: Dimmock has 
reared this species from larvae found in partly 
decayed bark of Betula fapyracea, on Mt. 
Washington, N. H. The imagos emerge 
from the pupae about 1 July, and are abun- 
dant during July in the White Mts. 

Melanotus ? parumpunctatus Mel\sh. (Proc. 
Acad. nat. sci. Phil., Nov. 1844, v. 2, p. 151-

an old beech stump, and are briefly described. 
The larvae are mentioned by G: Dimmock 
(Direct. collect. coleopt., 1872, p. 20) as liv- 
ing ‘‘in decayed chestnut and willow.” The 
larvae are very abundant in decayed and fal- 
len wood of Betula alba during autumn. 
Quite a large number of larvae taken in Mil- 
ton, Mass., 10 Nov. 1883, fed through the 
winter and produced a single beetle. From 
these larvae were reared: seven tachinid flies 
(allied to Morinéa), which emerged from 4 
June to 6 July 1884. The digestive tract of 
the larva of C. p/ceus is often inhabited by a 
microscopic undescribed nematod worm. 
Macrodactylus subspinosus Fabr. (Syst. en- 
tom., 1775, p- 39). This beetle devours the 
leaves of Betula alba. Its metamorphoses 
were described by Harris (Mass. agric. repos. 
and journ., 1827, v- 10, p. I-12), and many sub- 
sequent descriptions and figures have been 
given, among which may be mentioned Fitch 
(ast and 2nd rept. ins. N. Y., 1856, p. 245- 
252), Packard (Guide study ins., 1869, p.

(Direct. coleopt., 1872, p. 19-20) 
writes ‘* The larvae feed upon a fungus (Poly- 
porus betulinus) which is parasitic upon the 
trunks of white birch trees.” This beetle is 
New England, and 
agrees very closely with the description and 
figure of the larva of 7. Uémbatus from Eu- 
rope, as given by Chapuis and Candéze 
(Mem. Soc. sci. Liége, 1855, v. 8, p. 417-439,

mentioned as injuring oak and pear trees. 
Packard (Guide study ins., 1869, p. 228) 
quotes Harris’ account of the habits of this 


species. Huggins (Amer. entom., Feb. 1870, 
v. 2, p. 128) found this insect ovipositing 


in an apple tree. Packard (Bull.*7, U. S. 
entom. comm., 1881, p. 105-106) figures the 
larva, which he states to attack Udmus, Quer- 
cus, Acer and Platanus; and (of. c?t., p. 129) 
says, ‘‘In yellow birch at Providence,” R. I. 
Harrington (Can. entom., Dec. 1882, v. 14, 
p- 225) gives some notes upon this species 
and adds Fagus to the food-plants. 


NEW SOLVENT OF CHITIN.— Dr. 
Looss, assistant in the Zoological in- 
stitute at Leipzig, has found that a so- 
lution of sodic hypochlorite (ea de 
Labarraque of the druggists), or of po- 
tassic hypochlorite (eau de Favelle), is 
a fine solvent for chitin in making mi- 
croscopical preparations. He writes 
(Zuol. anzeiger, 1 June 1885, jahrg. 8, 
P- 334): 

‘* The liquid, as bought, completely 
dissolves, when heated, even the solid- 
est and hardest chitinous parts of insects 
in a short time, first making them glass- 
like, transparent, and entirely colorless. 
If the liquid is diluted with six or seven 
times its volume of water, and the chi- 
tinous parts, either fresh or after they 
have been hardened, are put in it for 
twenty-four hours, or even longer ac- 
cording to size, the chitin will be al- 
tered, altho not noticeably externally ; 
it loses much of its original brittleness,

quire, for complete staining greater or

oration is beautiful and distinct with 
either alcoholic or aqueous staining re-

this method which show, besides their 
great transparency, complete and clear 
coloration. This is likewise the case 
with nematodes and their eggs. It is 
furthermore especially remarkable that 
by this treatment the underlying soft 
parts are entirely spared and admit 
studying upon them the finest struc- 
tural relationships, such as the element- 
ary structures of striate muscular fibres 
(‘Muskelkiistchen’) and the nerve end- 
ings. Sections of bees’ heads have been 
made which were as beautiful as could 
be desired. At all events this reagent de- 
serves to be experimented with further.”

HERBERT KNOWLES MORRISON. 


Born 24 Jan. 1854, at Boston, Mass. 
Died 15 June 1855, at Morganton, N. C. 


Herbert Knowles Morrison was the eldest of 
the six children of William Albert and Mary 
Elizabeth Morrison (née Butler), of Cam- 
bridge, Mass. In early life he showed an ob- 
serving and practical turn of mind, and when 
not more than twelve years of age employed 
all his time out of school in hunting for in- 
sects. In later years he made a special study 
of noctuid moths, preparing his specimens 
with great neatness; and from 1873 to 1875 he 
contributed largely to the literature of that 
subject in this country. After 1876 he pub- 
lished little, and apparently nothing later 
than 1883. He was one of the original mem- 
bers of the Cambridge entomological club, 
and was also a member of the Boston society 
of natural history. He was a member of 
the first excursion party of the Cambridge 
entomological club to Mount Washington, 
in 1874, and seems to have determined from 
his experience at that time to devote himself 
entirely to the collection and sale of insects

as a means of gaining his livelihood. He 
was a most diligent and energetic collector, 
as was shown by his success in 1875, when 
he returned to the White Mountains early in 
the season, and came back late with 20.000 
specimens. In 1876, he visited the southern 
United States expressly to explore the field 
which John Abbot had made famous. His 
captures there were doubly successful, for he 
found occasion to return there the next year 
to be married; and he made his home there 
ever after. In 1874 he collected insects in 
Colorado, in 1878 in Nevada, in 1879 in Wash- 
ington territory, near the close of the season 
losing his entire collection and outfit by fire, 
in 1880 in Washington territory and south- 
ern California, in 1881 in Arizona and south- 
ern California, in 1882 in New Mexico, in 
1883 in Florida, in 1884 near Key West, Fla., 
and later in Nevada, in the spring of 1885 at 
Key West where he had an attack of dysen- 
tery which proved fatal. He was avery mus- 
with wonderful 
powers of endurance, which he tasked to 


the utmost. 


cular man, and endowed 
The physician who attended 
him in his last illness, and who had been an 
army surgeon, said that Morrison had the 
finest physique of any man he ever saw. 
Not infrequently he would walk forty miles 
a day in pursuit of insects, and than would 
take care of them before he slept, filling up 
the time while thus engaged in capturing the 
moths that were attracted to his light. His 
collections have furnished abundant material 
for the studies of many entomologists in 
America and in Europe. A widow and two 
daughters survive him. Bi Pal, 


PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 
LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES. 


29 AuG. 1883.—...The president [C. S. 
Wilkinson, government geologist] exhibited 
some specimens of fossil insects found in the 
tin-bearing tertiary deep leads near Vegetable 


288 

Creek, New England. This is the second 
discovery of fossil insects in Australia, and 
the specimens show the impressions of larvae 
and pupae of Ephemera or ‘‘May-fly.” 

26 Novy. 1884.—... On the larvae and larva 
cases of some Australian aphrophoridae. By 
F. Ratte, M.E. This paper describes the lar- 
val state of some small species of rhynchota 
closely allied to the genus Afhrophora and 
belonging probably to the genus Ptyelus. 
They are as yet imperfectly known; but the 
description of their larva-cases and-of some 
of the larvae discloses a feature probably 
quite new to the science of entomology. 
These cases, unlike those of insects generally, 
are true shells, containing at least three- 
fourths of carbonate of lime, and resembling 
in shape some fossil and recent serpulae, 
some being conical, others serpuliform, or 
helicoidal. The conical shells are fixed on 
the branches of some species of eucalyptus, 
the mouth turned upwards, the larva being 
placed in it with the head downwards. It in- 
troduces its suctorial apparatus into the bark 
of the stem, sucks the sap of the tree, and 
emits from time to time, by its anus, drops 
of clear water. This property of emitting 
water is possessed by all the family. 

The president exhibited four specimens of 
the shell-like covering of a species of Phry- 
ganea. These are built up entirely of small 
round nodules of brown iron ore, fastened to- 
gether by a silky web. They were obtained 
on the north end of New Caledonia, by Dr. 
Storer, in a creek flowing over rocks com- 
posed of iron ore. 

31 Dec. 1884.—...Mr. E. P. Ramsay, 
F.R.S.E., exhibited for Mr. E. G. W. Palmer 
a native bees’ nest which had been obtained 
in the neighborhood of Smithfield. For the 
last seven years it had been suspended from 
a branch of a pear tree in Mr. Palmer's gar- 
den, and a quart of honey had often been 
obtained from it, but during the last winter a 
caterpillar formed its cocoon in the only 
aperture and so effectually closed it that all 
the bees were killed.—Selected from Zool-

OBSERVATIONS ON DECAPITATED 
SILKWORM MOTHS. 


N. Passerini finds that decapitated silk- 
worm moths live a long time, but are tor- 
pid, move with difficulty and only under di- 
rect external excitation, and often disconnect 
themselves if they are paired. They live long- 
er than those which have not been decapi- 
tated; often living for more than a month, 
whereas normally the males die in six or seven 
days after they have issued from the chrysalis. 
The females live even longer than the males, 
but do not lay eggs. In one case three or 
four eggs were obtained from a female which 
had been decapitated while coupled with a 
male whose head had been left on, but al- 
though these eggs appeared to be fecundated | 
they did not hatch in the following year. 
The moths did not couple after both had been 
decapitated, but if the female alone was 
decapitated copulation did sometimes take 
place. If they were decapitated while coupled 
they very often separated; but sometimes 
they remained connected, without moving, 
until they died. If the male only was decap- 
itated while coupled, they separated; but this 
was not the case if the female only was de- 
capitated. This is readily understood, since 
the male holds the female by a special genital 
armature. Death does not follow decapita- 
tion instantly because the principal nervous 
centre does not reside in the head. Life is 
prolonged because the vital force of the in- 
sect is not consumed in the procreation of 
new individuals. The author could not find 
a satisfactory explanation for the failure of 
the decapitated females to lay their eggs, 
since the female normally lays all or nearly 
all her eggs even if they are not fecundated,

oesophageal ring operate, or at least regulate 
the emissson of eggs in this insect.— Sum-

6: 10 Dec., p. 658-662; 24 Dec., p. 676-680 ; 
to fig. ) 

Notice, by P. Mayer. (Zool. jahresb. ftir 
1883, 1884, abth. 2, p. 1, 8.) 

States that there is a genetic connection between the 
cells of the follicle and the nucleus of the egg. In geo- 
philus longicornis the cells are produced at the end of a 
kind of stolon formed by a prolongation of the nucleus; 
in g. carpophagus they arise by a process of budding at 
several points of the surface of the nucleus.

myriapodes. (Annal. sci. nat., 1882 [ Jan. 


1883], s. 6, v. 14, no. 3, p. 1-7, pl. 19 B.) 

The intimate structure of the nucleus in the marginal 
cells of the malpighian tubes, especially the structure of 
the moniliform nuclear cord and its relation to the nu- 
cleoli, are discussed and illustrated by figures from 
tulus, gryllotalpa, carabus, papilio and apis. There is 
an intimate connection (continuity?) between the cord 
and the nucleoli in which it terminates. The monila- 
tion may appear like surposed globules, or dark disks 
alternating with clear spaces, which may be transverse 
or inclined so as to appear like a spiral. The last con- 
dition may be natural or may result from a shifting of 
the disks due to treatment; according to the latter hy- 
pothesis the cord must have a limiting membrane.

and compound eye. &lt;A brief description of each is

compound eyes, it is held that ‘fa continuous picture,

several subcorneal images, falls upon the retina.”

ENTOMOLOGICAL ITEMS. 


Mr. W. M. Maske tt has lately described 
a curious species of cocctdae from New Zea- 
land under the name of Rkrzococcus fossor. 
The female of this species, which lives on 
Santolum cunninghamti, does not cover her- 
self with a scale, but sinks herself bodily 
in a circular pit in the substance of the leaf 
and there lays her eggs. 


ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.— 
This society, on the fiftieth year of its ex- 
istence, 1883, decided to take measures to 
obtain a royal charter. This charter has 
now been granted the society under date of 
20 July 1885, and ensures the society a legal 
existence and increased privileges and re- 
sponsibilities. 


INTRODUCTION OF HUMBLE-BEES INTO NEW 


ZEALAND. The attempts to introduce hum- 
ble-bees (Bombus) into New Zealand, in 


order that they may fertilize the red clover, 
have been hitherto unsuccessful, but this 
year a few have been landed alive in that 
country, having been brought in their dor- 
mant winter condition from England, and 
set free upon awakening. 


ELECTION OF HONORARY MEMBERS. At the 
session of the Entomological society of France; 
11 March 1885, E. de Sélys Longchamps, of 
Liége, Belgium, S. A. de Marseul, of Paris, 
and Dr. G. H. Horn, of Philadelphia, Pa., 
were elected honorary members of that socie- 
ty, and at the session of 8 April 1885, Dr. 
Auguste Puton, of Remiremont, France, was 
also chosen an honorary member. 


Types OF LEPIDOPTERA TRANSFERRED 
To CAMBRIDGE. Dr. Hagen informs us that 
the collection of lepidoptera heretofore at the 
Peabody museum, Salem, Mass., is now in 
his charge at Cambridge. The move is a 
good, and very necessary one. The collec- 
_ tion contains many of Dr. Packard's and some 
of Mr. Morrison’s types, and was slowly 
going to dust and Axthrenus when we last 
saw it.—Hxtom. americana, June 1885, v.

GROTE AS A COMPOSER.— Mr. A: R. Grote, 
the American lepidopterist, now residing in 
Bremen, has not only published numerous 
papers on moths, but several American mag- 
azines have printed verses by him. Shortly 
before leaving America he published a philo- 
sophico-religious essay, and he now takes the 
field as a composer of music, Fischer, of Bre- 
men and New York, publishing his op. 2, 
which consists of Vier miinnerquartette, dedi- 
cated to Herr C. O. Ruyter. 


CHEVROLAT’S COLLECTION OF COLEOPTE- 
RA.— The large collection of coleoptera be- 
longing to the late Auguste Chevrolat is 
offered for sale, divided into families, by H. 
Deyrolle et Cie, of Paris. The prices vary 
from 10 francs for the box of thorictidae, of 
which there are 11 species represented by 30 
specimens, up to gooo francs for the curcul- 
tonidae which are represented by gooo species 
and 29000 specimens. The collection of cur- 
cultonidae is said to be the largest excepting 
that of the museum at Brussels. 


SPECIMENS FADED BY EXPOSURE TO LIGHT. 
—Ata recent meeting (July 2) of the Lon- 
don entomological society, Mr. C. O. Water- 
house exhibited various species of phytopha- 
gous beetles to show the extraordinary effect 
that exposure to light had produced on their 
colors. Fiery red had turned to bright 
green, pale yellow to brown, blue to black, 
and green to purple. The specimens ex- 
hibited had been in the public galleries of 
the Bristol museum for twenty-five years.— 
Amer. naturalist, Jan. 1885, v. 19, p- 8o. 


TRIMEROUS SILPHIDAE.—Mr. D. Sharp 
describes a new species of the genus Scofo- 
cryptus (silphidae) in the Comptes-rendus 
de la Société entomologique de Belgique for 
7 Feb. 1885. This species, S. odscurus, like 
S. melifonae, the one on which Girard 
founded the genus in 1874, is from Bahia, 
South America. The species of Scotocryf- 
tus are blind, but are still more interesting 
structurally from the fact that they have all 
the tarsi three-jointed, a character not com- 
mon among coleoptera and otherwise un- 


298 


known silphidae. S. meliponae 
inhabits nests of Med‘fona scutellaris; the 
habits of S. obscurus are unknown.

FooD-HABITS AND VESICATING POWER OF 
Cantuaris. H. Beauregard, who has lately 
been completing his studies into the life-his- 
tory of Canthar?s vesicatorta, has succeeded 
in finding its pseudochrysalids in the sand 
about the cells of species of Colle¢es, upon the 
honey of which the larvae had subsisted. In 
the Comptes rendus for 8 June 1885, he also 
states that he has proved by direct experiment 
the inaccuracy of Neutwich’s assertion that the 
vesicating power of Cantharis is only devel- 
oped after copulation. As previously shown 
by Beauregard the cantharidin is chiefly lo- 
cated in the generative organs of these beetles, 
but experiments with the generative organs 
of specimens just emerged, and that cer- 
tainly had not copulated, showed the presence 
in them of strong vesicating power. 


INFUSORIAL PARASITES OF WHITE ANTS. In 
a paper read before the Royal society of Tas- 
mania, 17 Nov. 1884, Mr. W. Saville Kent 
described a new species of infusorian belong- 
ing to the genus Trichonympha of Leidy, 
and which Mr. Kent names 7. /eédyz. This 
species differs but little from the species (7. 
agilis) on which Leidy based the genus, and 
is found swarming in the intestinal canal of 
a Tasmanian species of ¢ermitidae, which 
has not yet been determined. Leidy recom- 
mends that, for the observation of these infu- 
soria, the contents of the intestine of the white 
ant be emptied into a little white of an egg; 
Kent recommends milk for the same pur- 
pose. Kent further says ‘‘Of the two remain- 
ing infusoria found by me in the Tasmanian 
white ant the one is apparently referable to 
Dr. Leidy’s genus Pyrsonympha, while the 
other belongs to Stein’s multiflagellate genus 
Lophomonas, so far recorded as a parasite only 
of the orthopterous insects Blatta and Gryl- 
lotalpa.”

INSECTS MISTAKING LEAVES FOR FLOWEKS 
At the meeting of the Entomological society 
of London, 1 April 1885, according to the 
Entomologist’s monthly magazine, for May 
1885, v. 21, p. 278;—‘*Mr. R. M. Christy 
(present as a visitor) exhibited a drawing of 
the larva of the local form of Platysamiacolum- 
Bia, known as nokomés: he had found the 
larva in Canada feeding on Zlaeagnus 
argentea, the peculiarly silvery appearance 
of which was strikingly in accord with 
the color of the larva, which latter was 
probably protected thereby. He also showed 
faded leaves of Betula glandulosa, and said 
he had observed Papilio asterias settle 
on similar patches of leaves, apparently 
mistaking them for flowers on account 
of the bright coloring. Mr. [J: J.] Weir 
said he had observed white butterflies settle 
on patches of variegated leaves in his own 
garden, and he alluded to the well-known 
case of bees coming to artificial lowers on a 
lady’s bonnet.” 


PRESERVATION OF INSECTS.—Apropos of 
the different notes upon the preservation of 
insects, that have been addressed to us, Dr. 
Jacobs states that he has recommended, in 
the Bulletin dela Société entomologique de 
Belgique (1879), the use of a solution of 
naphthalinin benzin. The insect is immersed 
in it, and, after drying, the crystals of naphtha- 
lin which are formed on the surface of the 
body are removed with a small brush. The 
solution penetrates the interior of the insect, 
where the presence of the naphthalin can be 
recognized. This process can be used for 
coleoptera, but not for the diptera, bees, and 
other hairy insects, for the brush removes 
the hairs and spoils the insect. 

Mr. Charles Zuber employs liquid ammonia 
to remove the salts of copper which form 
upon the pins; this process does not injure 
the insects. It is of course understood that 
the insects should not be replaced in their 
boxes until completely dried.—Feurlle des

ENTOMOLOGY DURING THE YEAR _ 1883.— 
An examination of the index of new genera 
which were established in the year 1883, as 
given in the lately completed ‘+ Zoologischer 
jahresbericht fiir 1883, herausgegeben von der 
Zoologischen station zu Neapel,” under the 
careful editing of Dr. Paul Mayer and Dr: 
Wilhelm Giesbrecht (abtheilung 1, 1885; 2, 
{arthropoda], 3. 4, 1884), Leipzig, W. Engel- 
mann, shows how rapidly our knowledge of 
insect forms progresses, and consequently 
also our collections are enriched by new spe- 
cies. According to this index the majority 
(455) of the 625 new genera among the in- 
sects belong to the coleoptera and lepidop- 
tera, to the former 254, to the latter 301; the 
remaining 170 being divided as follows: the 
hymenoptera 70, hemiptera 46, neuroptera 
and amphibiotica 27, diptera 18, orthoptera 
and thysanura § genera. 

This certainly astonishingly high number 
of new genera for a single year must attract 
all the more attention because all the other 
divisions of the animal kingdom together can 
boast only of 446 new genera during the 
same year.— Entom. nachrichten, June 1885, 
jahrg. 11, p. 191. 


WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF 
A KILOGRAM OF HONEY.— Alexander Wilson, 
of Dublin, has lately published interesting 
details upon the amount of sugar contained in 
the nectar of different flowers, and upon the 
harvest which honey-collecting insects make. 
He calculates that 125 heads of clover blos- 
soms, containing about 60 flowers in each 
head, or 7.500 blossoms, yield about 1 gram of 
sugar; the nectar from 7.500.000 flowers is 
necessary therefore to furnish a kilogram o¢ 
sugar; but as out of every too parts of honey 
only 75 parts are sugar, a kilogram of honey 
exhausts in round numbers 5,600,000 flow- 
ers; andthe bees of a hive must visit this 
enormous number of flowers to collect a kil- 
ogram of honey.— Deutscher bienenfreund 
Feb. 1585, p. 60. 

Since a colony of bees may make 30 or 40

kilograms of honey ina season of go days they 
must at this rate visit more than 2,000,000 
flowers a day, but as a colony often contains 
40,000 workers and a worker bee often visits 
50 flowers in less than half a day, this calcu- 
lation is not unreasonable. The amount of 
nectar in flowers varies very much with the 
flowers, and with conditions of weather and 
other conditions. lA (Cc 
The almost unnoticed work of domesticated 
honey bees produces more than 15 million 
kilograms of honey yearly, in the United 
States, which, at the above estimate, implies 
an amount of labor hardly to be imagined.

APHIS NECTAR AND HONEY. The nectar 
secretion from aphides is a well-known pro- 
duct. In many cases, however, notably the 
larch plant-louse, the lice so mimic the 
twigs on which they rest, that their pres- 
ence is hard to detect, especially as the lice 
are often confined to the upper branches of 
the trees. Often this nectar is secreted so 
abundantly, that the leaves, and the grass 
.beneath the trees, are covered at early morn- 
ing by drops so large that it'is easy to collect 
a considerable quantity of the nectar. Suffi- 
cient of this nectar can be secured directly 
from the larch lice and the elm cock’s-comb 
gall lice to test it. Bees are also known to 
gather it in large quantities. This Aphis 
nectar is very pleasant and wholesome, and 
unquestionably forms at times no incousider- 
able portion of our most beautiful honey. 
Such honey is light-colored, pleasing to the 
taste, and perfectly safe as a winter food for 
the bees. The truth of this statement is 
sustained by the fact that the bees work 
freely on such nectar, even though the 
flowers are yielding abundant nectar at the 


same time. The bees themselves practi-

Hapits oF sprperRS. The following note 
is extracted from a partial translation [Rec., 
3825] of Dahl’s ‘‘Beitrige zur biologie der 
spinnen” (Zool. anzeiger, 3 Nov. 1884, jahrg. 
7: P+ 591-595), as it appears in the Annals and 
magazine of natural history for Jan. 1885. 

“Tt has often been asserted that the geo- 
metrical spiders do not repair old webs. This, 
however, is true only ina limited sense. The 
outer framework and some of the radii which 
have become nearly free from transverse 
threads are probably always used again by 
Zilla x-notata and others. The rest is gath- 
ered up, worked into a ball with the mouth 
and thrown away. If the spider removes a 
lifeless object from the web, and damages the 
latter in so doing, it certainly sometimes re- 
produces the destroyed portion of the frame- 
work, the radii, and the central shelter. If 
we interrupt a spider in the formation of its 
web, by tearing away a portion of it with the 
corresponding part of the outer framework, 
all will be completed up to the part that has 
remained uninjured. In this case the comple- 
tion of the framework is especially interest- 
ing, as this unaccustomed work is not usually 
successfully performed at once. Here we see 
very distinctly how reflection comes into play. 
I was still better able to ascertain reflection, 
or, what is the same thing, actual inference, 
in the case of Attus arcuatus Bl., when I of- 
fered it fies touched with oil of turpentine. 
Sometimes the spider despised the species of 
fly employed (Homalomyia canicularis, L.), 
whilst it attacked other insects (e. g. Chiro- 
nomus tendens, Fab.) just as before. This 
spider also draws similar conclusions in those 
cases in which it cannot overcome insects in 
consequence of their chitinous armor being 
too hard. These it usually attacks only once, 
and is then for along time forewarned. Dan- 
gerous insects, however, such as small bees, 
it avoids, without having seen their sting. 
Here therefore we have an instinctive dread. 
Bee-like flies are equally dreaded.”

NOTES ON 


MELITTIA CUCURBITAE AND A RELATED 


SPECIES. 


BY SAMUEL HUBBARD SCUDDER, 


Tue tolerably full account of IZe/7¢ttza 
cucurbitae recently given by Mr. J. A. 
Lintner m his second Report on the 
injurious insects of New York recalled 
to me some observations made on the 
ravages of this insect in the squash 
vines on Cape Cod, and from my notes 
made at time, 
twenty-five years ago, I condense the 


the now more than 
following statement. 

My examination was made in the 
early part of September, and there were 
to be found at that time two kinds of 
aegerian larvae within the plants, a 
larger and a smaller, and in the ground 
were found cocoons containing larvae of 
the larger kind—which subsequent ob- 
servation showed remained through the 
winter without changing to chrysalis, 
and also a number of pupal exuviae 
protruding from the surface of ground 
which had not been hoed for a month 
or more. 

There are thus apparently two species 
of aegerians destructive to the squash, 
and it seems to be probable that the one 
represented by the smaller larvae and 
the chrysalis-skins is either a later ap- 
pearing species or that it is double- 
brooded, the brood represented by the 
smaller larvae in September being the

both were aegerians, as they agreed 
closely in all structural peculiarities, 
and they could hardly have been difler-

erent stages of the same species, since 
they differed so much in the color of the 
head and thoracic segments and in the 


general markings. The following des- 
cription of the larva of JZ. cucurdztae, 
fuller than before published, is drawn 
up from my notes.

the frontal triangle and passing down its sides 5

As this and the smaller larva were at 
first taken for different stages of the 
same species, the difference in their 
habits was not so carefully noted as it 
should have been. The present species 
was, however, by far the more destruc-

tive, being ten times more numerous than 
the other; nearly forty were taken from 
the inside of a single plant, they being 
found concealed in all parts from below 
the ground as far as they could burrow, 
to the base of the leaf stalks, and some 
were even in the squash itself; besides 
these, in the hill in which the same 
plant was growing, over twenty larvae 
were found in their chrysalis cases.

When ready for their change, they 
eat their way out of the stalk, reach the 
ground (probably by a thread, for they 
can spin one) enter the ground and make 
their cocoon there; this is formed exter- 
nally of grains of earth adhering to silk, 
and is of considerable stoutness though 
very thin; it is of a light brown color 
within and blackish without, so that 
when the earth is removed, the cocoon 
has a reticulated appearance, from the 
brown showing through the black ; the 
innermost layer of all is white. Some 
of these cocoons were kept, and the 
larvae were living within them on the 
26tn of the following May, having re- 
mained unchanged in the larval con- 
dition throughout the winter. They 
died. Thirty or forty 
cocoons were opened in the hills only 


subsequently 


to find the larva within. 
This is all the history of this species 
which was followed. The second spe- 


cies has very nearly the same habits,

su irequently, and the present species 
seemed to prefer in addition the harder 
parts of the plant, such as the junction 
of the leaf and stalk, of the.leaf stalk 
and main stalk, ete. The following is 
a description of the smaller species. 
Head jet-black. Body white, with a faint, 
dusky stigmatal band. Upper surface of first 
thoracic segment nearly black; a transverse 
series of cight brown spots on each segment 
behind the first, two faint ones being dorsal, 
one on each side infra-stigmatal, and the 
others pleural; those of the thoracic rings 
are much the most conspicuous, and on the 
abdominal rings there is a brown dot on each 
ring in front of and a little within the dorsal 
spots; the last segment is brown above with 
spots similar to those of MZ. cucurditae but 


more distinct; hairs as in that species. 


Length 13 mm.; breadth 2.5 mm. 


No difference was noted between the 
cocoons beneath the surface with living 
larvae (JZ. cucurdétae) and those of 
the present species which were emptied, 
the chrysalis forcing off (how?) the en- 
tire end of the cocoon, and by means 
of the hooks on the abdominal rings 
working its way to the surface. A 
single larva, kept in captivity, made a 
cocoon in a small box partly filled with 
earth, and it was noted that the cocoon 
was thinner than that of JZ. cucurdztae.

éctae will be found in Papilio, v. 2, p.

THE LARVAE. OF 


BY FRIEDRICH BRAUER, 


INSYAOIEME B05 


OESTRIDAE. 


VIENNA, AUSTRIA. 


[Translated by B: Pickman Mann from Friedrich Brauer’s “Monographie der oestriden,” Wien, 1863, p. 35-40. ] 


The larvae of the vestrédae, although 
in many cases quite peculiarly shaped, 


are so nearly related to the larvae of 


the rest of the mmzascédae-calyptera 
that it has not yet been possible to dis- 
cover for them a constant distinguish- 
ing character founded upon their struc- 
ture. The reason of this lies in part 
in the oestrid larvae themselves, since 
they are very different among them- 
selves, and in part also in our defective 
knowledge of the muscid larvae. 

At present, it is true, no real muscid 
larvae are known with large thorn- 
warts,—as I will call the dermal for- 
mations which occur in many oestrid 
larvae, which are conical, soft at the 
base, fleshy, and corneous at the tip,— 
also none with the characteristic stig- 
matal plate of the Gastrophilus \ar- 
vae; on the other hand very many are 
known with thorns, like those of Der- 
matobia, or naked, like those of the 
young Hyfoderma, or with horny 
stigmatal plates, like those of Cephe- 
nomyta. The 
method of life in mammals can prob- 
ably be looked upon as peculiar to the 
oestridae. 


remarkable parasitic 


I leave it therefore to a 
future observer to establish a character 
for the oestrid larvae whereby they 
may be distinguished from all other 


muscid larvae, and limit myself here 


tothe description of the larvae accord- 
ing to genera and species. 

The oestrid larvae belong to the 
great division of those dipterous mag- 
gots which have been called headless, 
since they are segmented throughout 
and the usual regions of the insect body

larvae. In general the following com- 
mon characters and peculiarities of the 
oestrid larvae can be specified. 

1. The body of all oestrid larvae is

tinctly separated, so that I take them 
together in the description, and desig- 
nate them both by the name of cephalic 
ring, on which in many cases an an- 
terior and posterior section is clearly 
to be distinguished. On that account I 
assume only eleven segments, as earlier 
authors have done. Only the new- 
born larvae of Gastrophilus make an 
exception to this number; they, if 
Joly’s statement is correct, possessing 
thirteen segments. 

2. Two anterior, external breathing- 
organs are always to be distinguished 
on the larvae, between the first and 
second segments of the body, and two 


posterior, external breathing-organs on

stigmatal plates which are constructed 
according to two kinds of types. One 
of these types is represented in Gastro- 
philus and Dermatobza, the other in 
the rest of the genera. The stigmatal 
plates are more or less protected by 
lip-like organs on the last ring or by 
withdrawal into the preceding ring, 
and are in this way cleaned from sub- 
stances which adhere to them. 

I have described in detail under that 
genus the structure of the posterior 
stigmatal plates in Gastrophilus. The 
majority of the genera possess how- 
ever two stigmatal plates in a real sense, 
consisting of corneous chitinous sub- 
stance on the last ring. Each ring is 
usually crescent-shaped or reniform, in 
younger larvae even quite circular, and

in many in the second stage a thinner, 
membranous or knob-like place super- 
posed or imbedded, sometimes enclosed 
inthe plate itself. The attachment of 
the trachea corresponds to this place on 


the inside. Since it usually has the

been taken for such, I call it the false 
stigmatal opening. It has not yet been 
ascertained without doubt that breath- 
ing goes on in such stigmatal plates, but 
it probably takes place through pores of

plates were penetrable especially at the 
circumference of the attachment of the

3. The new-born larvae all possess 
the later 
stages larvae with oral hooks and those 
without them are to be distinguished. 
An internal pharyngeal framework of 
various development always occurs; 
this encloses the membranous gullet 
and by its muscular structure is of es- 
sential service in the sucking of the 
larva. If oral hooks are present, they 
are connected with this by a joint. 


external mouth-parts; in 


Usually a U-shaped, bent chitinous 
plate is to be seen, whose open side 
looks upward; from the side it has the 
shape of a sitting butterfly whose large 
upper wing reaches far back and has 
the smaller, narrow under wing under 
it. Since the wings of the two sides 
are grown together firmly underneath, 
the whole pharyngeal framework ap- 
pears like a flying insect, when the 
wings are bent apart from above, and 
with the base in a plane. The part 
lying more or less in front, which is to 
be found in the middle between the 
wings, and which really radiates out 
into these, or is united with them like a 
ligament, is what Schroeder van der 
Kolk calls the tongue-bone. 

In the pharyngeal framework there-

(Schroeder’s tongue-bone) and four 
wing-like processes which ‘often again 
consist. of several parts. The body is 
connected with the wings posteriorly. 
It is always. bent in. a U-shape, and so 
that the open end looks upward, 7.e., 
if other soft parts of its vicinity which 
also close this are disregarded. [p. 37] 
Bent flat, it shows a more or less dis- 
tinetly H-shaped chitinous plate, with 


very broad side parts, which—in full- 


grown larvae—become confluent behind 
into a simple, broad plate, and only 
leave an oval hole in front of them for 
the passage of the discharge duct of the 
salivary glands, but posteriorly bear the 
four wing-shaped processes (two large

are jointed to the short anterior side 
parts. In the anterior curved excava- 
tion of this lies in the membranous ex- 
pansion a small corneous chitinous plate

nous frame of the proboscis.. I have 
repeatedly Convinced myself that such 
is really the case, since I. have opened 
the coarctate pupae of Cephenomyta 
and Gastrophilus before the emergence 
of the flies. Since in these genera, as 
we will see later, the nymph is tightly 
enclosed by the puparium, it can be 
noticed how the already freed pharyn- 
geal framework, which remains | at- 
tached to the puparium, rests in the 
mouth-fissure of the nymph, and is 
drawn out of it aS soon as the nymph 
is taken away or the lower lid is lifted 


off.

It is also easy to form ani idea that 
its internal parts corresponds to. the 
proboscis of the fly if it is observed 
how other muscid or syrphid larvae 
while alive project and withdraw this 
exactly as the fly does its proboscis. 

In f/ypfoderma the mouth-parts un- 
dergo a retrograde metamorphosis from 
the second stage (after the first molt) ; 
the oral hooks disappear, and therewith 
all the external mouth-parts, but the in- 
ternal pharyngeal framework remains. 

4. The oestrid larvae show antennae 
(at least rudimentary ones) above the 
mouth-parts; these have the appear- 
ance of corneous or usually membranous 
knobs, and in the latter case are pro- 
vided with one or two ocelli-like points. 
Subulate, many-jointed antennae, such 
as occur in many muscid larvae, are 
never found. 

5. All possess an anus, which lies 
on the last ring, under the stigmatal 
plates, and is very small.

6. They molt twice while they are 
parasitic. I have observed most closely 
the molting in Hypoderma larvae of the 
second stage. In A. déana the pas- 
sage from this stage [p. 38] to the 
last one takes place about the begin- 
ning of February. If in 
muscle which is richly larded with 
such larvae the capsules of those larvae 
whose hinder stigmatal plates have the 
shape of the third stage, but are still 
clear yellowish-brown, are carefully 
slit open, the skin characteristic of the 


a cutaneous 


preceding stage, with the many little 
thorns heaped in groups, will be found 
either still partly attached to the front 
end of the larva or entirely dependent 
from the cephalic end or folded together 
along the dorsal side. The process of 
molting seems to be entirely similar to 
that in the AZelophagus larvae ; at least 
Leuckart states that the old skin in 
these is shoved together toward the 
cephalic end of the larvae and there re- 
mains attached. The //yfoderma larva, 
immediately after the molt, is pure 
white, very soft, and appears naked, 
since the thorns do not become dark 
and distinctly separated from their sur- 
roundings until they harden. 

Three forms or stages are to be dis- 
tinguished, corresponding to the molts, 
which forms in AZypoderma, Gastro- 
philus and Dermatobia show great 
differences. In the third stage the lar- 
vae reach their full size, usually change 
their color and that often very consid- 
erably, and then first leave their host- 
animal, crawl away and pupate, after 
the manner of the musczdae.

| July—September 188s. 


7. This pupation must be consid- 
ered as a third molting, in which, how- 
ever, the skin is only detached around 
the pupa, but is not stripped off, and 
remains in connection with it by means 
of four tracheae. The hardened larval 
skin, or puparium, is burst open at the 
cephalic end by the emerging fly by 
means of the frontal bladder filled with 
fluid, in the direction of the arcuate 
Although 
the pupation resembles herein that of 
the muzscédae in general, yet there oc- 
curs in one part of the oestrédae, Z.e., 
in Hypfoderma, a peculiarity which has 
not been observed before, namely, that 
the larva transforms in the puparium 
in a completely outstretched condition, 
and this therefore is far larger than the 
insect which comes forth from it. 

8. So far as they have been observed, 
they lead a parasitic life in mammals, 
and feed upon the juices of these ani- 
mals. In Hypoderma a blood-red in- 
testine often shows through, and it is 
likely that these sometimes suck up 
blood in addition to the exudation which 
immediately surrounds them. 

g. The closely observed larvae all 
show at first a slow and finally a rapid 
development, so that there occurs a 
resting stage which often lasts seven 
months, between the swarming of the 
imago and the first visible appearance 
of the larvae. 

The larvae of the oestrzdae were for- 
merly divided into two groups: into lar- 
vae with oral hooks and those without 
external mouth-parts. Such a separa- 
tion is of service in distinguishing the 


sutures ina double manner. 


July—September 1885. ] 


full-grown larvae, but scientifically un- 
natural and incorrect, since in the first 
place this peculiarity of the full-grown 
larvae corresponds to no similar degree 
of relationship of the perfect insects, 
and in the second place it is only tem- 
porary, [p. 39] since all oestrid larvae 
possess oral hooks when they are quite 
young. Such a division also as Clark 
attempted to make, into caviécolae, cuti- 
colae, and gastricolae, is inadequate, 
for while the species of a genus do in- 
deed always agree in life-history so far 
as their occurrence as parasites in a de- 
terminate organ is concerned, neverthe- 
less the larvae of very different genera 
may also share this same manner of 
life with others; for instance, //yfo- 
derma, Cuterebra, Dermatobta, among 
which there is far more difference be- 
tween 1 and 2 than between Cuteredra 
and Cephenomyia, if the imagines are 
considered. Such a division is there- 
fore likewise not a natural one, since it 
disturbs the natural relations of affinity. 
Two elements must be considered, in 
order to bring about an approximately 
natural division: in the first place the 
organization of the larvae, and in the 
second place their manner of life; and 
the latter in a subordinate degree, 
though this is here more important 
than in other animals, since as yet there 
is no example of two species of vesty7- 
dae of one genus having been found 
parasitic in different systems of organs. 
Thus the Cephenomyza larvae belong 
to the oesophagus, the Cephalomyca 
and Oestrus larvae to the nasal and 
frontal cavity, those of Gastrophilus

to the intestinal tract, and those of /7y- 
poderma to the subcuticular cellular 
tissue. 

Although it is stated that the larva 
of Gastrophilus has been found in the 
oesophagus, this is one of the excep- 
tional cases which are not authenticated. 
Of course only the full-grown larva is 
meant here, since young larvae may 
always be found in other places during 
the immigrations. So for instance the 
young Oestrus and Cephenomyza lar- 
both 
through the nose, and their roads do 
not separate until they get there. but

the former into the frontal

geal cavity. 

Of the organs in which oestr/dae 
occur, the skin, or really the subcu- 
ticular cellular tissue, is that which is 
the most strongly attacked; the larvae 
of four genera: Hypoderma, Ocstro- 
myta, Dermatobia, Cuterebra, live in 
it. The nasal and frontal cavity are 
inhabited by the genera Cephalomyza 
and Oestrus, the nasal and oesophageal 
cavity by the genus Cephenomyza, the 
intestinal canal by the genus Gastro- 
philus. The 


other genera of vestridae are unknown.

It is interesting farther that many 
genera occur only as parasites of certain 
families of mammals, while others have 
a somewhat wider or very wide range 
of distribution, and so have for hosts 
the different mammals, yet not quite 
without choice, and often even seek 
men for their breeding places. 

Thus until now the larvae of Cephe-

nomytia have only been found in the 
throats of cerzv/za, those of the genera 
Cephalomyza and Oecestrus only in tylo- 


poda and cavicornia, those of the

Dermatobia in dogs, oxen, horses, and 
even upon man. 

[p. 40] Another picture is formed 
if the perfect insects are divided accord- 
ing to a peculiar character into those 
with pectinate antennal bristles ( C2¢e- 
rebra, Dermatobia), and those with 
naked antennal bristles (/Zypoderma, 
Gastrophilus, Cephenomyta, Cephalo-

ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON. 


6 JuNe 1883.—-Prof. J. O. Westwood. the 
life-president, read 
upon taking the chair, in which he briefly 
reviewed the progress entomology had made 
in times within his remembrance. 

Mr. Frank Cheshire, who was present as a 
Visitor, made some observations on section- 
cutting of the probosces of honey-feeding 
insects, as referred to by Prof. Westwood in 
his address. He recommended that the insect 
to be operated upon should be kept fasting 
for some time and then fed upon honey mixed 
with gelatine impregnated with some highly 
colored dye; the insect should be immediate- 
ly decapitated and the head rapidly cooled; 
it should then be embedded in gelatine and 
the section cut by means of the microtome. 
The mouth-passage is then easily seen from 
the presence of the dye. Mr. Cheshire then 
made some extended remarks on his various 


honorary an address, 


observations upon the minute structure and 
anatomy of the honey-bee, stating that many 
of his results differed much from the gen- 
authoritative statements.

2ST CLT Ex 511 


With regard to the tongue of the honey-bee, 
many authorities tube 
through its entire length, others as a gutter 
or trough, while in reality it is a trough on 
the upper side at the apex and a tube for the 
rest of its length; the structure of the 
extreme apex (Réaumur’s ‘*bouton”),—about 
which there existed so much difference of 
opinion,—was easily made out by the use of 
the means Mr. Cheshire recommended. 

4 Juty 1883.—Miss E. A. Ormerod exhibit- 
eda bunch of Adherrx ¢h7s, Fabr., found on a 


regarded it as a 


sprig of alder [ AZzus] overhanging water at 
Hampton Court by Mr. J. Arkwright. The 
swarm of flies measured about 6 in. [15 cm. ] 
long by 3 in. [7.5 cm.] broad, and consisted 
of many thousand specimens. 

Mr. E. A. Fitch called attention to a figure 
of a similar swarm of this species in the 
Compte-rendu of the Société entomologique 
de Belgique, for July 4th, 1874. 

Mr. W. L. Distant exhibited specimens of 
four of the five known species of American 


Sulgoridae. Three were from Central Amer- 


ca. 

Mr. G. C. Champion stated that in Cen- 
tral America he had kept forty or fifty speci- 
mens of fulgoridae alive for and 
had seen no trace of luminosity, neither did 
they stridulate; the evidence of the natives 
also was quite against these insects being 
iuminous. The fulgoridae were very slug- 
gish in their habits, Mr. Champion observ- 
ing that he commonly found specimens on 
the trunks of trees, where they sometimes 
had never seen a 
speciinen on the wing. Mr. Champion also 
related that he had not infrequently found 
larvae attached to and feeding on the white 


days, 


remained for days; he 


cottony secretion so abundant about some of 
the smaller fwlgoridae; he had found as 
many as three larvae attached to one imago. 

Prof. Westwood commented on the great 
interest of this last announcement, remark- 
ing that the three cases of lepidopterous par- 
asitism on the f/ulgoridae already recorded 
by him (Trans. Entom. soc. Lond., 1876, p. 


312 


519; 1877, p- 433) occurred on eastern spe- 
cies. He was glad to hear that Mr. Cham- 
pion had sent home specimens of the 
parasitic larvae, and hoped that further infor- 
mation would be attainable. 

Mr. G. Lewis remarked on the different 
forms existing in the various species of 
lucanidae, and stated that he believed these 
were due to the food of the larvae—whether 
the diet of the individual larva was nutri- 
tious and abundant or otherwise. 

Prof. Westwood remarked that the great 
modifications in the size, curvature, detlec. 
tion and dentition of the mandibles in male 
lucanidae required great caution in not too 
hastily assuming identity of species in cases 
of great individual divergences. 

1 AuG. 1883.—Sir Sidney Saunders commu- 
nicated the purport of two letters addressed 
to him by M. Edmond André, of Beaune, 
upon the subject of the terminal segments 
“des chalcides 4 queue’; stating that, atter 
further investigation, he concurred in consid- 
ering Sichel’s so-called hypopygium in those 
genera (Proc. Entom. soc. Lond., 1882, p. 
26, fig. 7D) as a conjoint segment comprising 
the dorsal and ventral arcs of the 7th. This 
he intends to notice in the Annales of the 
French entomological society. 

Mr. R. Meldola read notes from Dr. Fritz 
Miiller, on the following subjects: ‘‘Persecu- 
tion of distasteful butterflies by birds,” ‘*The 
colour of the pupa of Papilio polydamas” 
[showing that the green or brown coloration 
of the pupa does not depend upon the color 
of the object on which it pupates], and ‘‘How 
the caterpillar of Zunomia eagrus, Cram., 
employs its hairs” [showing by a figure how 
this glaucopid moth distributes its hairs each 
way from the pupa along the twig on which 
it pupates in order to defend the pupa from 
ants and non-flying foes. ]?

5 Sepr. 1883.—Mr. F. Enock exhibited a 
perfectly bilateral hermaphrodite AMacropis 
labiata, Panz., the face, palpi, 
mandibles, legs, and genitalia showing very 
characteristically; the right side was male, 
the left female. [This bee is figured (Trans. 
Entom. soc. Lond., 1883; Proc. p. 25) ]- 

In discussion, Vanessa cardut, L., Pantala 
flavescens, Fabr., and the trimorphic forms 
of Nezara L., were mentioned as 
being of cosmopolitan distribution, and 
Danats archippus, Fabr., was instanced as a 
species which had but lately taken to migra- 
tion, being now found in Britain, the Azores, 
New Caledonia, and various oceanic islands, 
where it was previously known not to occur. 

3 Ocr. 1883.—Mr. W. F. Kirby, on behalf 
of M. Alfred Wailly, who was present asa 
visitor, exhibited a large box containing nu- 
merous bred specimens of various silk-pro- 
ducing bombycidae. . . . One extraordinary 
specimen of a Sama was very notable;..-. 
on this Mr. Kirby read a note entitled ‘“‘Ab- 
normal specimen of the genus Samra.” 
[This note, describing the specimen in 
detail, is printed in Trans. Entom. soc. Lond., 
1883; Proc., p. 27- Concerning this specimen 
and description the following remarks are 
furnished to the editors of PsycHE : — 

ABNORMAL SPECIMENS OF SAMIA AND AL- 
Lies. The Sam/éa described by Kirby is noth- 
ing but a suffused aberration of cecropia. It 
emerged from a cocoon received among many 
others of cecrofia from the United States by 
Mons. Wailly, of London, Eng., who after” 
wards disposed of the moth to Mons. Godeffroi 
Moliinger, residing in the Netherlands. The 
latter sent me at the time an excellent, full 
size photograph of the insect, from which I 
saw in a moment that it was an abnormal 
cecropia. I have two agreeing with it almost 
exactly, save that they are not so large; have 
also seen another in a collection in New York 
that is nearly like it; in fact those things are 
not such rarities; almost any one who breeds

them. I have at various times bred or acquired 
otherwise examples of Z'elea polyphemus des- 
titute of the ocellate spots of the primaries ; 
also of endless variety of color; of Axtheraea

and one black; of Z'rofaea luna some with 
two ocelli on ove upper wing, and one with- 
out ocelli on any of the wings; and so on, I 
might go on enumerating hundreds in my 
own possession, besides many more scattered 
in various collections over the world.—Her- 
man Strecker, Reading, Penn. ] 

5. Dec. 1883. — Mr. F. P. Pascoe exhibited 
some remarkable insects’ nests from Delagoa 
Bay. They varied from half an inch [13 mm. ] 
to an inch and a quarter [32 mm.] in length, 
and in shape from globular to ovate. 


They 
were semitransparent, yellowish, and the sur- 
face, undera lens, hada reticulate appearance ; 
on one side, from the base to the apex wasa 
stout suture, to which was attached a septum 
extending about two-thirds across the interior; 
oneach side of this septum, but away from the 
suture, were placed in an erect position about 
120 cylindrical eggs. These nests had much 
the appearance of the dried pods of the ‘‘blad- 
der senna;” they were retained by a movable 
loop to the slender twigs of a shrub which 
Sir Joseph Hooker had pronounced to be a 
Rhamnus. 

Mr. R. McLachlan considered that these 
curious bladder-like egg-cases belonged to 
one of the mantidae. 

Mr. Wood-Mason did not think they should 
be attributed to the mantédae, altho possibly 
it might be so; he pointed out that the eggs 
were arranged in quite a different manner to 
those of any Mant¢s he had seen. He also 
suggested that the large vacant space existing 
between the egg-mass and the outside of the 
capsule would probably be protective against 
parasitic insects. — Abstracted and compiled

grams, and by the exhibition of specimens of 
every known species and form occurring in 
the genus.

on ‘North fiR’ec:,

7 May 1884.—Mr. W. F. Kirby exhibited 
a remarkably small and dark variety of Sama 
cecropra Linn., bred by Mr. Alfred Wailly. 

Mr. A. S. Olliff exhibited a new species of 
FHelota, collected in Angola by Dr. Welwitsch. 
The genus was previously known only from 
Mr. Olliff said that Lord Wal- 
singham had pointed out to him a similar 
and equally unexpected case of geographical 
distribution in the genus Deuterocopus of 
Zeller, belonging to the Aferophoridae, which 
up to this time had only been known from 
Java, and of which he has lately received 
an undescribed species from Bathurst, West 
Africa.

Mr. T. R. Billups exhibited specimens 
(some living) of Pelofpaeus archttectus, and 
its nest, which was found attached to a leaf 
of tobacco from Owensboro, Kentucky, and 
taken from a hogshead recently opened at 
Whitechapel, England. 

Mr. W. F. Kirby said that he had seen a 


314 


nest similar to the one now exhibited attached 
to a pod [ear] of maize. 

Mr. T. R. Billups stated that he had fre- 
quently witnessed encounters between the 
larva of Ocyfus olens and earthworms, and 
had kept Carabus auratus alive on nothing 
but earthworms for more than five months. 

Dr. D: Sharp remarked that Cydzster roe- 
seli had been kept alive from five to seven 
years by being fed on earthworms once or 
twice a day; he thought .... that earthworms 
were the favorite food of carnivorous coleo- 
ptera. 

Mr. W. L. Distant exhibited an ordinary 
specimen of C7léx sAinula, and remarked that 
though its peculiar position when at rest had 
been described, it had not been noticed that 
it thus perfectly resembled a species of the 
homopterous genus Flata.... He further 
remarked that the term ‘‘ mimicry,” recently 
loosely-used, could not be applied here, as 
the moth could hardly be considered to 
mimic a Flata which did not occur in our 
fauna. 

Mr. E. A. Fitch called attention to the 
great resemblance that Czlix spinula bore to 
the excrement of a bird, when at rest on the 
upper side of a leaf, as was its common 
practice. 

Mr. A. G. Butler remarked on the great 
similarity sometimes existing between lepi- 
dopterous and homopterous insects; he had 
lately described a lithosiid allied to Nuda- 
ria, from New Holland, which he certainly 
thought at first was a homopteron; the re- 
semblance was so striking that he had named 
the genus Homofsyche ; the hairs along the 
costa were very striking, and he quite be- 
lieved this was a case of mimicry. Quite 
lately he had found a second specimen in the 
[British] museum collection, which had been 
put away in the supplementary cabinet as 
not a lepidopterous insect. 

Mr. F. P. Pascoe, in connection with the 
above, exhibited a large and pretty chalcid 
(which Mr. Fitch determined as one of the 
cleonymidae), which he had lately captured

at St. Helier’s, quite thinking it was a hemip- 
teron; when running it had its wings over- 
lapping in true bug fashion. 

Miss E. A. Ormerod exhibited a piece of 
leather perforated by oes¢r#dae, the punctures 
being more than one to the square inch [16 
to the square decimetre}. Miss Ormerod 
called attention to what is known of the life- 
history of our bot-flies, and especially of the 
warble-fly (Zyfoderma bovis), and alluded to 
the practical necessity of attempting to lessen 
the amount of injury occurring both to the 
cattle themselves and to the hides. 

Messrs. W. L. Distant, E. A. Fitch, and 
C: V. Riley made further remarks upon the 
same subject. 4 

Mr. A. Wailly exhibited a large box of bred 
lepidoptera, especially of silk-producing dom- 
byces. Amongst them...were larvae hy- 
brid between Samia cecropfia and S. ceanothi 
(californica); the parents had paired with- 
out forcing in any way, but no pairing 
between the sexes of S. ceanotht could be 
obtained; he believed these larvae would 
produce S. gloveri.... 

3 Sepr. 1884.—Mr. W. F. Kirby, on be- 
half of Mr. A. Wailly, who was present as a 
visitor, exhibited... cocoons of Ceratocampa 
impertalis, and Mr. Wailly said that his sus- 
picions that this larva was a cannibal had 
been fully verified by Mr. E. F. Hitchings, 
of Warren, Mass., who thus writes respecting 
this species :— 

‘Tn the fall of 1881 I obtained several al- 
most full-grown larvae and put them in a 
box with plenty of pine and button-wood 
leaves; ina few days I noticed that several 
had disappeared, and upon examination found 
the skins with the juice all extracted. They 
were all of large size, and I found one or two 
of these skins held in the manner described. by 
you. I then putin several full-grown larvae 
of Telea polyphemus, and they were disposed 
of in the same way. This led me to conclude 
they were carnivorous. In 1882 I noticed 
the same thing.”

(Journ. Roy. micros. soc., Oct. 1884, s. 2,

The author states that animals climb vertical smooth 
surfaces either by means of a fluid which acts by capil- 
larity or is adhesive, or by atmospheric pressure; 
among insects the climbing is accomplished generally 
by means of a fluid secreted by glands, often of the 
tarsus, but the males of dytiscus and the larvae of 
blepharoceridae have suckers. As is the case with 
certain mites, the tarsal suckers of dytfscus are only 
used to cling to the female during copulation, Outline 
of the history of the subject as pertaining to insects, 
followed by description of mode of observation of the 
tarsal hairs in living flies, and account of the structure 
of the tarsus and its glands in some insects. Use of 
secretions to aid locomotion by certain dipterous, cole- 
opterous, hymenopterous and hemerobid larvae, by

THE PROCESS OF SKIN-CASTING IN A LEPI- 
DOPTEROUS LARVA.—The following account 
ofa larva casting its skin may be of interest, 
and may also throw some light on the curious 
phenomenon of ‘‘moulting,” for in’ many 
works on entomology we are only told that 
“the skin breaks at the back near the head, 
and that the larva walks out of its skin after 
a due amount of twitching and wriggling.” 
Whilst examining a looper caterpillar, about 
# inch [1 cm.] long and very transparent, 
under the microscope, I very 
struck with a peculiar internal movement— 
each separate segment, commencing at the 
head, elongated within the outer skin whilst 
the next ones remained in their former state. 


was much 


Each segment in its turn behaved in this 
curious manner until the last was reached, 
when the motion was reversed and proceeded* 
toward the head, when it was again reversed. 
I only saw this process of elongation accom- 
plished three times, although it may have 
been going on for some time before I cap- 
tured the caterpillar, which I found in a 
quiescent state. The whole proceeding ap- 
peared as if the larva was gliding within 
itself, segment after segment, the outer skin 
remaining stationary as if held by the other 
segments. whilst the particular one in mo- 
tion freed After remaining 
motionless for a short interval, the skin near 
the head swelled and burst open at the back;

before my eves. Presently out comes the head 
of the new caterpillar. pushing forward the 
old one; looking wonderfully clean with its 
ten shining black eyes on a cream coloured 
ground. After a short struggle the new, true 
legs, transparent fleshy limbs, very much re- 
sembling those of a newly-hatched spider, 
appear, pushing off and treading under foot 
the old ones. The outer skin must have sud-

such was the case, for on examining the 
latter segments, there I found the skin and 
the old true legs shrivelled up. The larva 
then, by a series of wild wriggles, endeavored 
to extricate its new prolegs (false legs), 
which in a short time it accomplished. Then 
all is clear, and the larva, which is quite ex- 
hausted, coils itself up and literally pants for 
breath. When it

PROGNOSTICATIONS OF WEATHER BY IN- 
secTs.—The current number (No. 17) of Die 
natur contains an article by Herr Emmerig, 
of Lauingen, on German bees as storm 
warners. From numerous observations, the 
writer advances tentatively the theory that

therefore, that the conduct of bees is a relia-

need not fear a storm. With regard to rain, 
merely, the barometer and hygrometer are 
safer guides than bees; not so, however, in 
the case of a thunderstorm. Finally, the 
writer trusts that his remarks on this subject 
may lead to further observation.—Wature, 
23 April 1885, 


V. 31; Pp: 587-

In regard to the prognostications of 
weather by insects, the following passages 
from Kirby &amp; Spence’s ‘‘Introduction to en- 
tomology” may be added :— 

‘*Huber says that he has ascertained bya 
great number of observations that electricity 
is singularly favourable to the secretion of the 
substance of which honey is formed by flow- 
ers; the bees never collect it in greater abun- 
dance, nor is the formation of wax ever more 
active, than when the wind is in the south, 
the air humid and warm, and a storm gather- 
ing.”—v. 4, p- 141. 

“But besides receiving notices from the 
atmosphere, of sounds, and of the approach 
or proximity of other insects, &amp;c., the anten-

can discover alterations in its state, and fore-

gaged in their daily labours, if a shower is 
approaching, though we can discern no 
signs of it, they foresee it, and return sudden- 
ly to their hives. If they wander far from

that the following day will be fine: but if 
they remain near their habitations, and are

though no other indication of wet should be 
discoverable, clouds will soon arise and rain

insects of prey also foresee the approach of 
wet weather, and the access of flies, &amp;c., to 
places of shelter. Then the spiders issue 
from their lurking-places, and the ground- 
beetles in the evening run about our houses. 

Passive antenna2, which are usually fur- 
nished with a terminal or lateral bristle, and 
plumose and pectinated ones, seem calculated 
for the action of the e/ectr‘c and other fluids 
dispersed in the atmosphere, which in certain 
states and proportions may certainly indicate 
the approach of a tempest, or of showers, or 
a rainy season, and may so affect these 
organs as to enable the insect to make a sure 
prognostic of any approaching change: and 
we know of no other organ that is so likely 
to have this power. I say electrfe fluid, 
because when the atmosphere is in a highly 
electrified state, anda tempest is approach- 
ing. is the time when insects are usually 
most abundant in the air, especially towards 
the evening: and many species may then 
be taken, which are not at other times to be 
met with: but before the storm comes on, all 
disappear, and you will scarcely see a single 
individual upon the wing. This seems to 
indicate that insects are particularly excited 
by electricity. —But upon this head I wish to 
make no positive assertion, I only suggest 
the probability of the opinion.t”—v. 4, p.

THE ENTOMOCECIDIA. 


Introduction. 


BY FERDINAND ANTON FRANZ KARSCH, BERLIN, GERMANY. 


[Translated by B: Pickman Mann, from Entomologische nachrichten, July 1834, jahrg. 10, p. 205-209. ] 


I propose to offer, under the above 
title, within the next few years, a list, 
arranged by families according to a 
zoological system, of the galls (cecidia) 
which are produced on plants by insects 
(entoma), so far as such a list will serve 


to fill up gaps now existing. The cate- 


’ 


gory ‘‘plant-galls” is to be taken in the 
widest sense of the word, i. e., it is to 
embrace all those modifications which 
lie outside of the normal methods of 
development of the plant, and which are 
presumed to be due to the influence of 
a definite insect in any stage whatever 
of its development, from the egg to the 
Usually only those vegetal for- 
mations are designated by the 
‘galls,’ which, while they do lie outside 
of the normal structure of the plant 
under consideration, yet show forms so 
definite and so perfect in themselves that 
they might rather be spoken of as an 
ornament than as a pathological phe- 
nomenon of growth. Of this kind are 
the well-known puff-balls of our oaks, 
the bedeguars of our roses, and the spi- 
rally twisted petioles of our poplars. 
But a wider knowledge of such forms, 
and the observation that anomalies 
which are far less obvious, and there- 
fore are usually overlooked by the laity,

term 


are due to exactly the same formative 
impulses (such, for instance, as the 
crumpling of the leaves of trees by the 
suction of certain aphididae), make it 
the 
‘‘oalls,” and now every creative reaction 


necessary to broaden category 
of a part of a plant against an irritation 
which affects it, 
from an animal ora plant, is conceived 


whether proceeding 
of as a gall-making activity, and the re- 
sultant structure (cecidium) is termed a 
mycocectdium if a fungus figures as the 
impulse of the pathological formation, 
and as a zoocecédium if it is due to an 
animal. 

If a coleopterous larva devour the 
parenchyma of a leaf, or a caterpillar 
spin together the margins of the leaves 
in order to make itself a shelter and to 
prepare itself a closed storehouse for 
food, the inhabited part of the plant 
opposes no obstacle to the doings of the 
animal, and the ‘‘miners” are very well 
to be distinguished from the cecidozoa. 
Bladder-galls, on the contrary, arise in 
another way, when the parenchyma of 
the leaf increases instead of becoming 
less, and the affected place thickens ; 
and cecidia arise when leaves of trees 
expand in a direction other than the 
usual one, solely because of the irrita- 


332 


tion resulting from the sucking action of 
an animal, without being cemented by 
threads. In this sense some of the in- 
sects included among the gall-makers 
(cecidozoa) by F. Rudow (Uebersicht 
der gallenbildungen, welche an Tilia, 
Salix, Populus, Artemisia vorkommen, 
nebst bemerkungen zu einigen anderen 
gallen: Zeitschr. ftir d. ges. naturwis- 
sensch., 1875, v. 46, p- 237-287) [p. 
269] cannot be considered as such, but 
Trachys minuta Fabr. and Phyllotoma 
microcephala Klug must rather be desig- 
nated as miners. The resinous galls*also, 
which are included among the galls by 
Haimhoffen, in his Beobachtungen tiber 
die menge und das vorkommen der pflan- 
zengallen und ihre specielle vertheilung 
auf die verschiedenen pflanzengattungen 
und arten (Verh. K.-k. zool.-bot. ges. 
in Wien, 1858, v. 8, p. 285-294), cannot 
be placed there without a distinction, if 
their method of formation presumes no 
real reaction on the part of the plant 
against the attacks of the enemy. There 
belongs, for example, the 
tihal,” which, a saccharine secretion, 
serves as an abode and for the transfor- 
mations of some coleopterous larvae, the 
Larinus mellificus Jeckel and L. macu- 
lZatus Falderm., and which occurs not 


‘manna 


uncommonly in Persia, on species of 
E-chinops.+ 

It is another matter, however, when 
such formations arise only accessorily, 
as for instance they are connected with

the swelling of the wood in the case of 
the effect of Zortrzx zebeana Ratz. 
On the other hand, since the recently 
published exhaustive investigations of 
Graf zu Solms-Laubach and P. Mayer, 
it can no longer be questioned, as it has 
been repeatedly in the past, that the 
caprificators belong to the cecidozoa. 

It has been asserted that the cecido- 
zoa preferably or solely attack diseased 
plants or parts of plants; indeed Ratze- 
burg goes so far as to set up the view 
that texthredintdae are purposed to 
clear away diseased vegetal matter. 
Every day observation teaches that 
little weight is to be attached to gener- 
al statements of this kind; the branch- 
es of oaks and elms, while loaded with 
galls, show forth in autumn in the most 
luxuriant green! 

The list which I have planned is not 
alone to comprise the palearctic ento- 
mocecidia and their producers, but is to. 
take into consideration also those of the 
rest of the regions, so far as attainable. 
At the same time the number of plant- 
galls as yet made known, which are 
produced by exotic insects, from all the 
rest of the geographical regions, is a rel- 
atively very small one—with the single 
exception of some of those of the ant- 
arctic region, whose entomocecidia 
have already been partly described in 
numerous North American periodicals 
hard to get at. 

By the gradual publication of a com- 
plete codex of entomocecidia I believe 
I shall partially supply the need of a 
codex of zoocecidia in general, which 
need has long been greatly felt, and has 


October—December 1885.] 


constantly become more pressing. The 
existence of such a need is sufficiently 
shown by the circumstance that single 
parts of this codex have already been 
worked out by illustrious men. Thus, 
in regard to insects, Julius elder von 
Bergenstamm and Paul Loew have 
compiled a ‘‘Synopsis cecidomyida- 
rum,” Wien, 1876. (Published by the 
From Verh. K.-k. zool.-bot. 
ges. in Wein, 1876, v. 26, p. 1-104.) 
Among all the animals (cecidozoa) 
which produce cecidia, the insects form 
decidedly by far the greater majority. 
Almost all the orders furnish 
one or another representative, and often 
from systematically very distant fam- 
ilies. 


authors. 


The number of species of ceci- 
dozoa among the lepidoptera, coleo- 
ptera and hemiptera is small; it is far 
greater among the hymenoptera and 
diptera ; among the rest of the animals, 
gall-makers are found only among the 
minute acarzda, among the micro- 
scopic rotatorza (living beings usually 
subordinated to the crustacea), and 
finally among the xematoda. Among 
the acaréda it is exclusively the genus 
Phytoptus Duj. (which has been very 
imperfectly investigated as yetin regard 
to its species) which gives rise to plant- 
galls (phytoptocecidia, the erzxea, 
phylleriaceae, cephaloneue of the old 
botanists) of the most manifold config- 
uration of shape. The plant-galls of 
Europe, produced by Phytoptus, have 
been worked up rather exhaustively, 
especially by their most distinguished 
connoisseur, Friedrich Thomas, in 
Ohrdruf near Gotha, who has published

fers in the lack of any reference to

sable requisite to a critical appreciation 
of the accumulated material. 

In spite of the large number of facts 
already made known, the study of the 
entomocecidia and their producers still 
continues to offer a wide field for new

importance from a purely entomological 
point of view, inasmuch as the rearing 
of galls yields insects which belong to 
the parasites and inquilines, which 
could not probably be obtained in any 
other way, but it is so also because it

and entomology. But study of 
plant-galls has moreover a deep prac- 
tical interest in two other directions, in 
an industrial and agricultural regard. 
An all-sided consideration of the subject 
should not leave these sides of it un- 
attended to.

ON THE RELATIONS OF FUNGI TO GALLS AND TO LARVAE

[Reprint, with slight amendment, of an abstract with the same title, by Hermann August Hagen (Canadian 
entom., July 1885, v.17, p- 136-137), of a review, by Friedrich August Wilhelm Thomas (Irmischia, 188s, v- 5,

The right expla- 
nation will be a double symbiosis of a 
phanerogamous plant and a fungus, and 
of a fungusand anentomozoon. Years 
ago I received from Gotha such larvae 
out of the rust-fungus of /tosa. A 
similar manner of living is known in 
Germany for DAlosts coniophaga 
Winnertz and for D. caeomatis Winn. 
Their larvae were found by F. Loew 
in the rust-fungus of several plants

p-155- ). I am able to add two new 
facts. I found larvae of Cectdomyia

CLOSE OF VOLUME FOUR. 


For two years past, reasons personal to the 
Managing editor have prevented the giving of 
that attention to the issue of PsycHE which 
otherwise should have been expected. The 
concluding numeros of volume four appear, 
therefore, two years in arrears. Care has 
been taken, however, that no fault of anach- 
ronism should be committed in preparing the 
numeros for publication. 

The form of the Systematic index adopted 
in volume two, and more perfectly elaborated 
in volume three, is regarded as of such ex- 
cellence in its features of general utility and 
extensibility, that ithas been adhered to care_ 
fully in this volume. So far as seemed to be 
practicable, every subject treated of in this 
volume has been included in the Systematic 
index under its appropriate designation, with 
references to the paragraphs of the Biblio- 
graphical record. 

The Alphabetic index, as in previous vol- 
umes, contains references to every technical 
name of a genus or species of animals men- 
tioned by such name in the volume, with 
references to the pages. 

The volume is committed to the custody of 
the subscribers and the entomological public 
with the sincere hope that it may be found of 


permanent value.

PROCEEDINGS OF SOCIETIES. 


CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB. 


9 Jan. 1885.—The 107th meeting of the 
club was held at 61 Sacramento St., Cam- 
bridge, 9 Jan. 1885. In the absence of the 
president, Mr. R. Hayward was chosen chair- 
man. On account of the lack of a quorum 
the business of the annual meeting could not 
be transacted, and consequently the reports 
of the officers were deferred until the next 
meeting. 

Mrs. A. K. Dimmock showed specimens of 
a hymenopterous parasite, probably one of 
the pteromalids, from the eggs of Smertn- 
thus excaecatus; the egg from which the spe- 
cimens shown had been reared contained 
over thirty of these minute parasites. [See 
Psycue, Apr.-June 1885, v. 4, p. 282.] 

Dr. G: Dimmock exhibited his collection 
of North American cécéndelidae, and made 
some remarks upon the species and their dis- 
tribution. 

13 Fes. 1885.— The 108th meeting was 
held at 1g Brattle St., Cambridge, 13 Feb. 
1885, the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder, in the

president was delivered. The annual reports 
of the secretary and of the treasurer were 
read, and the secretary made a special report 
upon the condition of the library. [Abstracts

of these reports, except the last, are appended 
to the report of this meeting. The address of 
the retiring president is published in PsycHE, 
Jan.-Mar. 1885, v. 4, p. 245-250.] The presi- 
dent’s address gave rise to much discussion 
of fossil insects, participated in by all the 
persons present. 

Dr. G: Dimmock stated that Heterodon 
platyrhinus, the so-called ‘‘hog-nose snake,” 
eats Caloptenus femur-rubrum, fragments of 
these insects having been found abundant in 
the excrement of one of these snakes taken 
in northern Connecticut last fall. The popu- 
lar name of this species of snake in western 
New England is ‘‘ puff-adder ” or ‘‘ flat-headed 
adder.” 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed a box of fine 


336 


borings which had been sent to him from 
Springfield, Mass., with an inquiry as to 
what produced them. They had been found 
in a house, deposited in dark places beneath 
furniture, in large masses. Upon examina- 
tion of the debris, empty cocoons and pupal 
skins were abundant, which under the micro- 
scope were readily seen to be those of some 
species of ant, probably Formica pennsylva- 
nica, which has been known previously to 
attack woodwork of buildings. 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed a specimen o¢ 
Cermatia that had been taken in an office in 
Boston, Mass. 


Abstract of Secretary's Report, 13 Feb. 85. 
By G: Dimmock. 

The present is the 1o7th meeting of the 
Club. Since the last annual (or 98th) meet- 
ing, held 12 Jan. 1884, four active members 
have been elected, seven have withdrawn 
from membership, and two have forfeited 
their membership by continuous neglect to 
pay the annual fees. The club has continued 
its policy of electing no new associate mem- 
bers. Mr. F. G. Sanborn, an associate mem- 
ber, has died during the year. An obituary 
notice of him was published in PsycuHE, 
Aug.-Sep. 1884, v. 4, p- 205. The number of 
active members is now twenty-seven, and 
the number of associate members forty-nine. 
During the year 1884 the club held nine 
meetings, with an average attendance of four 
persons. Valuable and interesting commu- 
nications were presented at each meeting. 
The Club’s publication, Psycue, has steadily 
gained favor, and the list of exchanges with 
scientific societies and valuable periodicals 
has increased, thus bringing the club prom- 
inently before the entomologists of the world. 
The wide distribution of the membership of 
the Club, while adding to its importance, has 
not been compatible with large personal at- 
tendance at the meetings. The advantages 
of larger attendance show the advisability of 
increasing the number of active members, 
who will be able to come to the meetings in 
person.

[October—December 1885. 


Abstract of Treasurer's Report, 13 Feb.’85. 
By B: Pickman Mann. 


Open accounts have been kept separately 
with each volume of Psycne, or the years to 
which each corresponds. The account for 
volume one shows a deficit of $19.05; that 
for volume two, $239.89; and that for the 
years 1880 to 1882, inclusive, a balance on 
hand of $34.59. No further expenditures 
will be incurred on these accounts, and those 
for volumes one and two will be met as re- 
ceipts come in from the sale of copies or 
from other sources. Expenditures and cur- 
rent receipts on account of volume four still 
continue. The estimated deficit on this ac- 
count is at least $245.00. Especial efforts 
have been made to determine what debts due 
to the Club, for subscriptions, may be con- 
sidered good for collection, and the sending 
of PsycHe has been discontinued to all per- 
sons unreasonably in arrears. The principal 
of the permanent publication fund amounts 
to $270.39. [The Treasurer’s report was 
duly audited and approved. } 

13 Marcu 1885.—The togth meeting was 
held at 61 Sacramento St., Cambridge, 13 
March 1885. In the absence of the president, 
Mr. T. W: Harris was chosen chairman. 

The secretary stated that Mr. J: G: Jack, 
of Chateauguay Basin, P. Q., Canada, had 
withdrawn from membership, by letter dated 
2 March 1885. 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed some microscop- 
ical slides to illustrate the structure of the. 
different kinds of stigmata in insects. 

10 ApriL 18$5.—The 110th meeting was 
held at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 10 April 
1885, the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder, in 
the chair. 

Mr. R. Hayward spoke of a trip which he 
proposed to take to southern Colorado, in 
company with Mr. F: C. Bowditch, the com- 
ing summer. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder called attention to cer- 
tain peculiarities of the venation of the wings 
of fossil cockroaches, and made some com 
parisons of the tertiary neuroptera of Europe

and North America. This was followed by 
a general discussion of fossil insects. 

8 May 1885.—The 111th meeting was held 
at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 8 May 1885, 
the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder, in the 
chair. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder read 
concerning mosquitoes and their abundance, 
from notes which he had made in 1860 while 
travelling about Lake Winnipeg 
the Saskatchewan River.

and upon 
Some discussion 
followed, upon mosquitoes and other dipte- 
rous pests of similar habits. 


Mr. S: H. Scudder announced the death of 


Dr. Hendrik Weyenbergh, well known asa 
naturalist and entomological writer from Hol- 
land, who had chosen the Argentine Republic 
as a field of labor. He died while upon a 
visit to his native country. 

Dr. G: Dimmock explained a method 
which he had devised for advantageously 
utilizing sale-catalogs of books in prepar- 
ing subject bibliographies, thereby saving 
much writing. 

12 JUNE 1885.— The 112th meeting was 
held at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 12 June 
1855, the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder, in 
the chair. 

Mr. R. Hayward read a paper upon the dis- 
tribution of insects in the White Mountains 
of New Hampshire, in which he called at- 
tention to the existence of four tolerably dis 
tinct faunae in these mountains. The first- 
which he called alpine, is restricted to the 
summits of the higher mountains; the sec- 
ond, which he termed sub-alpine, is confined 
to the neighborhood of the timber-line; the 
third occupies the greater part of the country 
below, and is the ordinary fauna of northern 
New England; while the fourth is confined 
to the immediate vicinity of the larger river- 
bottoms, and is essentially identical with 
that of eastern Massachusetts. Mr. Hay- 
ward’s paper led to considerable discussion. 

Dr. G: Dimmock described the life-history 
of Sphaerularia bomb?, a nematod which is 
parasitic in humble-bees (Bombus), as it 
has been elucidated by Dufour, Lubbock,

bombi were shown; were taken 10 
June 1885, in Cambridge, Dr. 
Dimmock, who believed this to be the first 
record of their occurrence in America. [See 
Amer. nat., Jan. 1886, v. 20, p. 73-75.] A 
brief upon Sphaerularia, 
upon other subjects, followed. 

g Ocr. 1885.—The 113th meeting was held 
at 61 Sacramento St., Cambridge, g Oct. 
1885, the president, Mr. S: H. Scudder, in 
the chair. 

Mr. E. F. Ladd, of the N. Y. Experimental 
station at Geneva, N. Y., communicated,

discussion and 


through Mr. B: P. Mann, some observations 
made by him in the fall of 1884, on the life- 
habits of cerealella, which 
found to have completely infested the collec- 
tion of corn in the museum of the station. 
Hundreds of moths emerged daily, and it be-

that the 
larvae feed only upon the deposit of starchy 
matter in the kernel. Larvae were not found 
in the varieties of sweet corn, in which the 
starch is distributed throughout the kernel, 
but they were found, frequently two and oc- 
casionally three in a kernel, in the flint corn. 
in which the starch is deposited in a mass. 
In pairing, the moths remained together 
75 minutes. One moth laid thirty-six eggs, 
in two patches of 17 and 19, which hatched 
in seven days, from 2 to g November. The 
eggs were at first milky white, showing an 
orange tint at the end of twenty-four hours, 
and gradually becoming deep orange at the 
end of thirty-six hours. They were laid, on 
the bottom of a dish, in threes, touching at 
the ends. 

Dr. G: Dimmock described the method 
adopted by him in rearing cocctnell¢dae, and 
gave a brief account of the life-history and 
habits of these insects. 

Dr. G: Dimmock noted the excessive abun- 
dance of a species of aphididae on a few 
maples on North Avenue in Cambridge. So 


An examination seems to show

abundant were these insects that, especially 
under one tree, the drops of their sugary 
secretion made the sidewalk beneath con- 
stantly appear as if there had just been a 
light shower. On account of this shower of 
sugary material the upper sides of the leaves 
of the trees had the appearance of having 
been varnished. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder reviewed C: Bron- 
gniart’s Fossil insects of the primary forma- 
tions, and showed the proof-sheets of the 
first half of his contribution to Zittel’s 
Handbook of paleontology. The portion, of 
which proofs were shown, treated of the 
myriopoda, the arachnida, and part of the 
insecta, and was abundantly illustrated. 

13 Nov. 1885.—The 114th meeting was held 
at 61 Sacramento St., Cambridge, 13 Nov.1885. 

Dr. G: Dimmock exhibited a collection of 
bred coccznellidae, among which were many 
varieties bred from a single pair of Coccznella 
novemnotata. 

My. R. Hayward showed a few specimens 
of several coleoptera collected by him in 
southwestern Colorado during the past sum- 
mer. Among them were Amphtzoa tnsolens 
and a specimen of Wedbria trifaria. The 
Nebria showed a curious monstrosity, the 
tarsi of the right anterior leg being trifur- 
cated. In all other respects it was a normal 
specimen. 

Mr. F. S. Child spoke of a specimen of 
Argynnts tdalia which he had taken in Barn- 
stable co., Mass., exhibiting remarkable col- 
orational variation. He also mentioned the 
occurrence, in the autumn of 1883, of Zuptoz- 
eta claudia at Magnolia, Mass. 

11 Dec. 1885.—The 115th meeting was held 
at 19 Brattle St., Cambridge, 11 Dec. 1885. 

On motion of R. Hayward a vote of thanks 
was tendered unanimously to Mr. S: H. 
Scudder for the use of the office of Sczence 
for club meetings during the past two years. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder reviewed a recently 
published paper by Prof. Felix Plateau, en- 
titled ‘‘ Recherches expérimentales sur la 
vision chez les insectes” (Bull. Acad. roy. 
Belgique, 1885, ser. 3, v. 10). The chief ob-

[October—December 1885 


ject of Prof. Plateau’s researches was to dis- 
cover if insects could distinguish the shape 
of objects. 

Mr. S: H. Scudder made some remarks 
upon the cockroaches (d/attarfae) of the 
mesozoic period, and exhibited six chromo- 
lithographic plates of New England butter- 
flies. The plates gave rise to considerable 
discussion on different species of New Eng- 
land butterflies. 

Mr. P. S. Abbot noted the capture of Eu- 
ploteta claudia and Funonia coenta at Old 
Orchard Beach, Maine, in 1882. 

Mr. B: P. Mann communicated (through 
the secretary) two notes accompanied by 
specimens. The first was concerning a dig- 
ger-wasp (St¢izus) and a cicada (Crcada) : 
‘‘In regard to the cicada and wasp there is 
nothing new to say. They were caughtin the 
house, the wasp bringing the cicada in its legs 
as Sfzzus is knowntodo. Thecicada seemed 
to be dead when picked up from the floor where 
the wasp had dropped it upon finding itself 
hemmed in by the walls and window panes.” 
The other communication was concerning a 
butterfly, Eudamus tityrus, and will be pub- 
lished in PsycHeE. 

Dr. G: Dimmock showed a large larva of 
some species of oestridae (? Cuterebra emas- 
culator), which had been sent to him by Mr. 
Leroy H. Sykes, of Suffield, Conn. This 
larva was taken by Mr. Sykes, about 20 Sept. 
1884, from beneath the skin of a chip-squirrel 
(Tamias striatus) just at the right of the 
median ventral line, near the umbilicus. Mr. 
Sykes thinks the squirrel was a castrate. 

Dr. G: Dimmock explained an apparatus 
by which he was enabled to rear insects in 
gases of different kinds or in determinate pro- 
portions of gases and air. 

Dr. G: Dimmock described the way in 
which the red mites that were so abundant 
about Cambridge this year produced the fine, 
light colored lines upon leaves of clover, 
grass and other plants. Leaves which had 
been marked by these mites were shown. 

Dr. G: Dimmock mentioned certain habits 
of Corixa and Notonecta.

TENACITY OF LIFE IN CALLIPHORA VOMITO- 
RIA.—At the meeting of the Société entomolo- 
gique de France, 8 July 1885, as reported in its 
Bulletin, Mr. Paul Audolent remarked that he 
had lately had an opportunity of proving the 
vital power of larvae of Calliphora vomitoria. 
Many of these larvae, which he had given as 
food to tritons, remained alive two days at 
the bottom of the water, and in fact pupated 
there. He had collected these pupae to see 
if they would reach the perfect state. 


BIRDS NESTING IN HORNETS’ NESTS.—In

kingfisher, which also nests in ants’ nests: 

At Mergui, in South Tenasserim, I found 
a nest of #. chlor?’s in a hornets’ nest, and 
although I saw the birds repeatedly enter the 
hole they had made in the hornets’ nest the 
hornets did not seem to mind it, but they re- 
sented in a very decided manner my attempt 
to interfere with the nest.

life and to practical apiculture. Dr. Dzier-

Pastor Dzierzon, was born 16 Jan. 1811, in 
Lowkowitz, near Kreuzburg, Upper Silesia. 
Shortly after finishing his studies at Breslau,

di Bologna” a series of excellent illustrations 
of the minute structure of the eye of diptera, 
The paper, published under the title of ‘‘Fig- 
ure dichiarative della minuta fabbrica degli 
occhi de’ ditteri,” consists of twelve large 
plates with explanatory text (28 pages), and 
gives microscopical details (enlargement from 
190 to 410) of eyes of h¢eppoboscidae, oestridae, 
syrphidae, muscidae, empidae, leptidae, astl-

STRUCTURE AND HABITS OF OEDEMATO™ 
PHAGA AEGUSALIS. E: Meyrick (Trans. En- 
tom. soc. Lond., 1884, p. 73-74) makes a new 
genus, Oedematophaga, for Pyralis aegusalis 
Walk., ‘‘correcting” the specific name aegalis. 
O. aegusalis isa curious insect, having as one 
of its generic characters ‘‘Anterior femora in 
male with an expansible tuft of hairs,” a char- 
acter recalling a peculiarity of certain species 
of Catocala. The larvae feed gregariously ‘‘in 
large, very irregularly spherical, rough galls, 
three or diameter, on the 
branches of a phyllodineous Acaeza,”...‘‘the 
larva eats galleries through the substance of 
the galls, ejecting a good deal of the excre- 
ment from holes in the surface.

DIPTEROUS PARASITE OF THE RHINO- 
ceros.—Dr. Friedrich Brauer describes and 
figures in the Verhandlungen der zoolog.- 
botanischen gesellschaft in Wien (1884, v. 
34, p- 269-271, pl. 10) the larva of a new 
genus and species of oestridae from the 
stomach of Rhinoceros sumatrensis. The 
larva differs strikingly from that of Gastro- 
philus in having the arcades of the posterior 
stigmata forming on each side three bands, 


352 


curving in zigzag, and not three concentric 
semicircles, from which peculiarity the author 
has given the insect the generic name Gyro- 
stigma. The entire larva, the mouth-parts, 
and posterior stigmata of G. swmatrensts, the 
new species in question, are figured. 


PoSTURE OF NEWLY EMERGED BUTTER- 
FLIES.—Mr. Joseph Anderson called atten- 
tion, several years ago, in the Entomologist, 
to ‘fa singuiar habit of Afatura tris upon 
emerging from the puparium,—to wit, its 
clinging to the empty case with the head 
uppermost for five or six hours, and then 
reversing the position (still keeping hold of 
the chrysalis) and remaining with head down 
‘and wings upward for a similar time.” Since 
that time Mr. Anderson has learned from Mr. 
F. N. Pierce, of Liverpool, that Vanessa 
polychloros has a similar habit, except that 
it leaves the pupal case and clings to a 
branch. In a note in the Exfomologrst for 
September 1885 (v. 18, p. 241-242), Mr. An- 
derson asks the reason for this curious habit 
of two butterflies, which thus differ in habit 
from Vanessa to, V. urticae, V. cardut, and 
Erebia medea. 


EROSION OF GLASS. — Under this title 
William M. Ord communicates to Mature, 19 
Feb. 1885, v. 31, p- 360, the results of some 
experiments upon the erosion of glass by 
alkalies in connection with colloid substances. 
These experiments were undertaken with 
especial reference to the question of how 
‘‘white-ant mud” was capable of eroding glass. 
Mr. Ord thinks that ‘‘the white-ant mud must 
consist of a mixture of some colloid with car- 
bonate of lime or some other salt capable of 
taking spherical form.” In conclusion he 
adds, as a result of his experiments, “It suf- 
fices, at the moment, to indicate that the sur- 
face of a glass slide may be eroded in a way 
to suggest the action of an acid, such as hy- 
drofluoric acid, when no free acid is present; 
and that erosion may occur when the glass is 
brought in contact with alkaline fluid, a col- 
loid, and crystalline substances capable of

EUDAMUS TITYRUS FLYING AT NIGHT.— 
On the evening of 5 Aug. 1885. at gh. 30m., 
I removed a mosquito netting from a window 
near which I was sitting, to close the window 
for the night, when a butterfly flew in. It 
fluttered very little in the room, and suppos- 
ing it to be a moth I paid no particular atten- 
tion to it at the moment. About ten minutes 
later, however, happening to approach the 
gas chandelier, I saw the butterfly suspended 
to one of the screws holding a glass globe 
around one of the gas-jets. It was stationary, 
but frequently uncoiled its tongue so that 
only the tip remained between the palpi, and 
then slightly coiled and uncoiled it so as to 
rub the tip between the palpi. It would sud- 
denly coil the tongue up completely, and 
then soon resume the former motion. Upon 
my attempting to capture it, after watching 
it some time, it uncoiled the tongue so as to 
free the tip completely from the palpi, and 
then beat against the globe as a moth would 
to get at the flame. Finally it got inside the 
globe and scorched its wings and fell to the 
floor, but fluttered frantically when I tried to 
pick itup. It proved to be Eudamus tityrus, 
and is sent herewith.—B: Pickman Mann, at 
meeting of C. E. C.. 11 Dec. 1885. 


PARASITES NEMATODS.—M. Henri Gadeau 
de Kerville, at the meeting of the Société en- 
tomologique de France, 9 Sept. 1885, report- 
ed the finding of three species of nematods 
in arthropods, which are interesting additions 
to the lists of arthropods in which parasitic 
vermes have been found. The species of ne- 
matods were determined by A. Villot, of 
Grenoble, as follows: Gordius emarginatus 
Villot, of which the determination is doubtful 
because the caudal extremity of the specimen 
was partly hidden in the digestive tube ofa 
Lithobius forficatus, its host, from which M. 
Villot did not wish to completely extract 
the worm; Merm/s acuminata Siebold, from 
a larva of YpsiPetes sordidata Fab.; and

Mermis nigrescens Dujardin, of which a young 
individual was taken from a larva of Hyher-

hitherto as a parasite of a myriopod. 

In this connection attention 
work on these parasites, which seems to be 
little known in America. This is Linstow’s 
Compendium der helminthologie .... 1878 
[Rec., 3119], in which one is able readily to 
trace the literature of most species of parasi- 
tic worms if either the name of the host, 
whether vertebrate or invertebrate, or that of 
the parasite is known.

TOMATO-PLANTS AS REPELLANTS OF IN- 
secTs.—According to the Colontal mazl,a 
statement comes from the Cape Colony 
which is deserving the attention of botanists. 
It is alleged that insects shun the land on 
which tomatoes are grown; and the cultiva- 
tion of the Lycopersicum 
accordingly recommended in all cases where 
it is possible to grow it—under fruit trees, 
for instance, since the tomato will thrive in 
the shade of other trees, which few other 
plants will do—for the sake of the virtues 
attributed to it as prophylactic against the 
inroads of insect pests. It would be interest- 
ing to know whether the tomato has been 
observed to exercise any such effect upon 
insects elsewhere—in Canada, for instance, 
where the fruit is so popular—or whether it 
is only in warmer climates, like that of the 
Cape, that its peculiar powers are brought 
into play.— Nature, 1 Jan. 1885, v. 33, p. 202. 

It may be sufficient to state that the use of 
tomato leaves as repellants of insects was 
recommended in France and in the United 
States at least as long agoas the year 1846, 
but that experiments properly made have 
shown the inefficacy of the remedy. The 
roots, stems, leaves and fruits of this plant 
are eaten by numerous species of insects. 
There is no reason to suppose that the Cape 
Colonists are any less ready than their north- 
ern relatives to jump to the conclusion, on 
insufficient grounds, that because a plant has

certain qualities noxious to man, it is there- 
fore also noxious to insects. 


FossiL THYSANURA. — At the meeting of 
the Société entomologique de France, 27 May 
1885, as reported in its Bulletin, Mr. C: Bron- 
gniart made the following communication : 

**Claus places the thysanura among the 
orthoptera; they are generally considered 
to be the primordial type of insects. No one 
has recorded them from the paleozoic strata. 

‘‘Nevertheless they existed as early as the 
coal period, for forty-five specimens have 
been found in the schists of Commentry. It 
is difficult to see the number of joints of the 
tarsi, palpi and antennae, but these organs 
are distinguishable on many specimens. The 
body is cylindrical, slender at the posterior 
part, and ends in a multiarticulate filament 
as long as the body. The antennae and tarsi 
are thickish. The head appears quite broad. 
The prothorax is very short, and the meso- 
thorax and metathorax are equal in length 
and much longer than the prothorax. The 
abdomen has ten segments, equal among 
themselves; the terminal one, which bears 
a multiarticulate filament, is a trifle the 
longest. There seemed to me to be abdomi- 
nal laminations upon one of the specimens, 
as there are in Machil’s. The whole animal 
(antennae, feet, thorax, abdomen) is clothed 
with very thick and very short hairs. The 
body, including the abdominal filament, 
varies in length between 15 and 22 mm. 

‘“This insect resembles morphologically 
Lepisma and Machitlis ; it differs from them 
by many characters, but principally in the 
presence of a single abdominal filament in 
the fossil form. 

‘*T designate this ancestor of the living 
thysanura under the name of Dasyleptus 
(dasys leptos) lucasi, dedicating it to Mr. 
Hippolyte Lucas, of the Natural history mu- 
seum of Paris.” 

ON CARRYING HIBERNATING LARVAE 
THROUGH THE WINTER.—I have sometimes 


so carried larvae in ice boxes, or in ice 


304 


houses, or in snow banks, by aid of friends 
in the northern states mostly, but last fall I 
heard of a large room called a ‘‘ cooler” at 
the Sanitarium at Clifton Springs, New 
York, in which meat and vegetables are kept, 
the temperature averaging 40° F. all the year, 
and my application for a little space was 
kindly received. In October, I sent on two 
boxes by express, in which were a large num- 
ber of larvae, some of them very rare. of 
these were Argynnis halcyone, just from egg; 
Satyrus charon, also just out of egg. These 
small larvae were in paper pill boxes, inside 
tin. There were also a few larvae of Chéono- 
bas chryxus, Hip. vridingstt, Colias alexandra, 
Phyciodes picta, in stages from second to 
fourth; and several Melitaea rutbcunda, 
past third moult from Vancouver’s, Island, and 
[AL] phaeton at same stage. Early in March 
I received the larvae per express. On open- 
ing the box nearly every one of the young 
larvae first named were alive, and in a few 
moments were moying. The larger part of 
rubicunda and phaeton were in good con- 
dition. One alexandra out of two was 
healthy, and one fzcta out of three. The 
chryxus, past third molt (one), and the rzd- 
tugstt, past first (one), were dead. On the 
whole, there was scarcely any loss from the 
four The Chéonobas, I 
am disposed to think, died in transit to me, 


months seclusion. 


from rolling about in its box, as it was 
stout and healthy looking when I received it. 
Probably all the satyrid larvae would have 
done better if they had not been allowed to 
feed in the fall, but had on hatching been 
subjected to the cold. I had no plants ready 
for these larvae on their arrival except grass, 
and on this I placed part of the chavon, who 
very soon began to eat along the edges of 
the leaves. The remainder of all species I 
put on ice, or under rocks in the woods, to

ANATOMY OF MACROTOMA PLUMBEA. — 
“Ueber Macrotoma plumbea. Beitrage zur 
anatomie der poduriden” is the title of a 46- 
page inaugural dissertation, by Albert Som- 
mer, from the G6ttingen university, also 
published, with a plate, in the Zertschrift 
fiir wissenschaftliche zoologie. The author 
studied carefully the histological structure of 
the ventral tube with its pocket-formed, eva- 
ginable lobes for attachment of the insects to 
objects beneath them, and finds that unicel- 
lular glands furnish the tube with the secre- 
tion necessary for attachment, and make it 
a remarkably good adhering organ that en- 
ables the little animal to move on vertical 
smooth surfaces. The egg is formed, by the 
union of yolk-substance, from an aggregate 
of cells at first of uniform shape which have 
their origin in the germarium; a germinal 
vesicle is lacking; a condition which calls to 
mind the eggs of viviparous dipterous larvae 
studied by Ganin. The observation is inter- 
esting that even the adult insects still molt 
every two or three weeks. In molting the 
old hairs are stripped from the new layer of 
skin; the scales, on the other hand, are shed 
without connection with the new ones. A 
gregarinid occurs as an almost constant par- 
asite in the chylific ventricle; outside the 
digestive tract occur pseudonavicellae, cysti- 
cercae similar to those described by Stein 
from the digestive tract of Tenebrio molitor, 
and nematods rolled up spirally. It would 
have been better to have replaced the name 
Macrotoma, used in the cerambycidae since 
1832, by Zomocerus Nicolet 1841. — Entom.
