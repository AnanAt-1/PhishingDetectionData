<p>In the course of many years of consulting work since 1995, Dirigo Multimedia,
  Inc. has also developed many commercial products, some of which are sold <a href="#direct">directly
by Dirigo</a>, but sold at a discount without any support included-- because there just isn't  enough time in the day for me now to offer quality support, given my other programming projects. I'm currently considering options for selling these products through other Xtra vendors who can support them fully. </p>
<p><em>Some Dirigo plug-in and utility products were formerly sold by <a href="http://www.updatestage.com">updateStage, inc.</a> in Arlington, Massachusetts, which in January 2007 stopped selling new product. However, <a href="udstage.html">support</a> is still available through updateStage for customers who bought products through updatestage. </em></p>
<p>Dirigo also has developed plug-in and utility products that are owned by <a href="#othercomp">other outfits</a>.<br>
  <br>
  You can
see pricing and ordering information for most of these products <a href="order.html">here.</a>
Please contact Dirigo by <a href="mailto:gpicher@dmulti.com">e-mail</a> to arrange purchase of a 
licensed version and a serial number. </p>

for a demo version if a demo is not mentioned  below):</b><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "masterapp.html">MasterApp Xtra</a> for Windows and Mac gives you
    comprehensive control over the way other applications such as browsers or Adobe Reader work with Director.

    ZapApp.) Demo versions, sample movie and documentation are available <a href="masterapp.html">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="binaryio.html">BinaryIO Xtra</a> for Mac and Windows allow you to read and write binary data to disk 
  files (even using the resource fork, on Mac files). Demo versions, a sample movie and documentation 
  are available <a href="binaryio.html">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href = "udstage.html">ProgressCopy Xtra</a> for Mac and Windows allows
    fast file copying, optionally with a configurable progress bar and cancel
    button. <br>
        <br>
  <li><a href = "WDMInputXtra-interfaceDescription.html">WDMInput Xtra</a> for Windows allows
    for display of video from WDM/DirectShow capture drivers on more than one screen, and
    allows capture to still image files or to AVI files. The Xtra can also select video inputs or
    tune television channels, and can play back AVI files on more than one monitor. Interface
    listing is <a href="WDMInputXtra-interfaceDescription.html">here</a>, and a demo version 
    with sample Director movie or Authorware
    calculation icon scripting is available by <a href="mailto:gpicher@dmulti.com">e-mail</a>. <br>
        <br>
  <li><a href="udstage.html">DisplayRes Xtra</a> for Windows allows you to change
    the display monitor size and color depth 'on the fly' (or after a restart,
    if necessary).<br>
  <br>  
  <li><b>DV (digital video) image capture Xtra</b> for the Mac, to display and capture images from Firewire cameras and camcorders (or any other video or imaging devices with QuickTime capture drivers).<br>
      <br>

    the Mac-- small, fast utility applications that can be automatically run
    when a CD is inserted to decide whether to install the CD-ROM's software
    or to run an already-installed copy of the software from the hard drive. AutoStart, now showing its age, is a Classic application on the Mac which has not been updated for Intel-based Macs that can't run Classic. <br>
        <br>
  <li><a href = "udstage.html">DropStart</a>, a Macintosh drag-and-drop application
    to make using QuickTime's AutoStart feature a no-brainer. This is included
    with the AutoStart download at <a href="udstage.html">updateStage</a>. This product too is showing its age, as QuickTime AutoStart is a Classic feature not available on MacOS X machines. <br>

        <br>
  <li><a href = "udstage.html">Versions XObject</a>, a Windows plug-in for Director
    4, 5 and 6 that lets you check DOS, Windows, QuickTime and file version numbers.The

    shaped cutout mask. (The Xtra unfortunately does not work with ATI's newer
    Radeon versions of the All-In-Wonder card, and does not work on Windows NT,
    2000 or XP.)<br>
