History and genealogy, 1273-1871, of the Caldwell family in France, their immigration to England in 1563, and settling in Scotland by 1567. In France, the surname was spelled Calwel, Calvel, Caulwel, Colwell, etc. In Scotland and Ireland, the surname was chiefly spelled as Caldwell or Cauldwell, etc. The family immigrated from Scotland to Ulster, northern Ireland in the early 1600s. John Caldwell (1683-1750) married Margaret Phillips, and in 1727 they immigrated from northern Ireland to New Castle, Delaware. They settled in Paxtan Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Brunswick (later Lunenberg) County, Virginia. Descendants and relatives lived in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and elsewhere. Most of this genealogical data is about the family in France, Scotland and Ireland. This includes genealogical data about a Colvill family that immigrated in the 1300s to Scotland, and later spelled the name Caldwell.
