<h1> Internet Access Programs </h1>

This directory contains programs you can use on an old PC to connect to the
Internet.  They are not Tandy-specific, though they will work on the Tandy
1000's.  These programs were mostly submitted by Marc Williams
<a href="mailto:marcdw@charter.net?subject=Internet programs">
&lt;marcdw@charter.net&gt;</a>,
who tested them on a Tandy 1000HX (7.16MHz V20). I tested them on a 1000TL
(8MHz 80286). <p>

<h3> <a name="A">What You Need</a> </h3>

It is assumed that you have an XT-class 8088, 8086, or 80286 PC running
bare DOS (no Windows) and that you will be connecting by SLIP or PPP to a
local Internet service provider.  Most of these applications will also
work if you're so fortunate as to be connected to an Internet-accessible
LAN via Ethernet (see below), but that's not my focus here.  You need to
have 640k DOS RAM, a hard drive, and at least a 2400 baud modem (or the
lowest speed your provider supports, if higher; faster is, of course,
better).  If you're running DOS 5.0 or later and can configure your system
to load stuff in upper memory blocks (perhaps with a hardware LIM 4.x EMS
card), it will help a lot - many of these applications are seriously
memory-hungry.  In any case, DOS 3.3 or later is good to have, since a
couple applications require it and the improved batch programming helps a
lot.  You also need a fair amount of patience, since setting up DOS for
the Internet is like herding cats. <p></p>

<h3> <a name="B">What You Need to Know</a> </h3>

You need to know how to create batch files in DOS, how to create directories 
and dearchive files, and how to modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
files.  If you don't know those things, it's time to dust off your DOS
manual.  You need to know how much memory you have, what commands your modem 
supports (dust off your modem manual too), what port and IRQ your modem is  
on, what DOS version you have, and what your video card is.  It helps if you
have had some experience with setting up Internet on some other system
(maybe Windows) already, or know someone who has. <p>

If you're not comfortable writing batch files, dialing scrips, and so forth,
the best thing to do is get a shell account on your provider's machine,
which is a much easier way to get on the Internet with an old machine.  The
only software you need for that is a communications program (Qmodem,
Procomm, and Telix are a some good ones).  The comm program should support
VT100 emulation.  The provider will have text-based programs you can use for
WWW (Lynx), telnet, ftp, gopher, and other services.  You don't need any
special information for a shell account (maybe a book on Unix would help);
it works like any BBS.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="C">Modem Configuration</a> </h3>

Taking things step by step, the first step is to get your modem to work.
That might be obvious, but over half of the postings to the Arachne
 mailing list (see <a href="#Q">Arachne</a>, below) have been about
modem-related problems. <p>

Before you try to dial your ISP and connect to them, you need to verify that
you've got your modem set up right by calling into a regular BBS with some
standard communications software.  Your modem probably came with a
communications program, and your modem's manufacturer probably has a BBS
whose number is in the manual, so try calling them.  (If you don't know the
number of a BBS to call, Cardinal's BBS is 1-717-293-3074.  If you don't
have communications software, check a large DOS software site like
<a href="http://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/">http://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/</a>
.)</p> <p>

You will need to give an init string for your modem when you set up the
dialing script for your packet driver or its dialer.  For newer modems,
&quot;AT&amp;F0&quot; will work fine; that just resets the modem to the
factory defaults, which should be fine for Internetting.  My modem is older,
and its factory defaults are kind of screwy.  I've got its CMOS set up for
the correct settings, however, so I give &quot;ATZ&quot; for my init string,
which reads the settings from CMOS.  You can set up your modem's CMOS to
your liking using terminal mode in your communications program (if your
modem has CMOS); check your modem's manual.</p> <p>

Generally, you need to set up your modem to enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow
control (&amp;K3), to hang up when DTR is dropped (&amp;D2), and to allow
DCD to follow the true state (&amp;C1).  You want to get result codes (Q0)
and specify that they should be text, not numbers (V1).  If your modem
provides hardware error correction and data compression, you want to enable
them as well.  See your modem manual; modem AT commands are not entirely
standard.  (If you have an old modem without data compression, error
correction, or flow control, that is fine - just they are good to use if you
have them.)</p> <p>

There are a few special cases to note.  First, if you have a &quot;plug and
play&quot; (sometimes called &quot;plug and pray&quot; :-) modem, you will
need to configure its driver in AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS.  In addition,
the BIOS in an XT will not be able to detect a plug and play modem, so you
need to specify the modem's I/O port and IRQ when you configure your packet
driver and its dialer (or any other communications software), rather than
just saying &quot;COM1:&quot; or &quot;COM2:&quot;.  For example, if you
have your mouse on COM1: and your modem on COM2: is plug and play, you will
need to specify I/O port 2F8 and IRQ 3 instead of just giving a COM: port
when you configure your dialer and packet driver.</p> <p>

Second, if you already have two serial port devices and you install the
modem as the third one, the BIOS on many older machines will not detect the
modem on the third COM: port.  Again, you will have to explicitly specify
the I/O port address and IRQ setting when you configure your dialer and
packet driver (or any other communications software).</p> <p>

Third, if you have a Rockwell RPI or Rockwell DPI modem, you will need to
disable data compression, error correction, and flow control on it (using
the init string).  Note that for most modems you want those things enabled
for greater throughput; Rockwell RPI modems are an exception.  They are
designed to implement data compression in software, making them cheaper than
other modems of the same speed.  If you bought one of these
&quot;cheapies,&quot; you're going to pay for it now :-).  To do data
compression, Rockwell RPI modems require special software.  Under DOS, that
software is Quick Link II or Comit.  Under Windows, there is a
&quot;Rockwell RPI applet&quot; that you have to run (or use Quick Link II
for Windows).  None of that is going to help you with DOS software like
packet drivers that don't support Rockwell RPI.  Your modem will still work,
but you won't be able to use its data compression, error correction, or flow
control features.  To determine if your modem is Rockwell RPI, type
&quot;ATI3&quot; in terminal mode of your communications program.  If the
modem returns a string containing the word &quot;RPI&quot;, it's an RPI
modem.  See this page for more gripes about RPI modems:</p> <p></p>

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/faq-c-rpi.html">
   http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/faq-c-rpi.html </a> <p></p>
</blockquote>

Finally, it is possible that your modem will work with regular
communications software at some given speed, but it won't work for Internet
at the same speed.  For example, if you have a 14.4k modem with V.42bis
compression, you would normally set up your software to run it at 57.6k.
That might work fine for BBSing, but it might not work for Internet because
Internet is more work for the processor.  This depends on the speed of your
system, the type of UART chip the modem has, and the packet driver you
select.  Under no circumstances, though, should the modem's connect speed
(the DCE rate, set via the init string) be greater than the packet driver
speed (the DTE rate, configured in the dialer and packet driver). <p></p>

<h3> <a name="D">Static vs. Dynamic IP</a> </h3>

Every machine on the Internet has a numeric address called its &quot;IP
address,&quot; for example, my machine is 205.183.16.48.  If you get the same
IP address every time you dial in to your provider, as I do, that is called
&quot;static IP address assignment.&quot; <p>

It costs your ISP about $10 a month to reserve an IP address (well, probably
a bit less, since they buy in bulk), so it is more economical for them to
get a limited set of addresses and share them out.  That way, they don't
need an address for every user, only an address for every phone line, since
not all users are connected all the time, and users who are not connected do
not need IP addresses.  If your ISP is allocating addresses that way, you
will get a different one each time you call, which is called &quot;dynamic
IP address assignment.&quot;</p> <p>

Now, remember that <em>every</em> machine on the Internet has an IP address,
not just your machine - and that includes the machine you dial into when you
call.  That machine, which belongs to your ISP, is called your
&quot;gateway&quot; machine.  On some providers, not only is <em>your</em>
IP address dynamic, but your <em>gateway's</em> address is too.  That could
happen if your provider uses more than one networked machine to answer calls
from users.  Dynamic IP with a dynamic gateway is the most complicated
situation to handle.</p> <p>

Some ISP's are now assigning nameservers dynamically.  That is not going to
work for DOS.  Make them tell you the IP address of one of their servers.</p>
<p></p>

<h3> <a name="E">SLIP or PPP?</a> </h3>

Whether you want to use SLIP or PPP depends on you and on your provider. 
PPP may be easier to set up, particularly if you use Nettamer (see below),
but the SLIP packet drivers take much less RAM (about 6k versus 68k or
more), leaving more for your applications to use.  Web browsers in
particular work better with more RAM, and if you use Etherppp or Klos PPP as
your packet driver you might not have enough RAM left to browse the Web at
all.  Of course, your provider may offer only SLIP or only PPP, so you may
not have a choice. <p>

Static IP is the simplest situation, and if you have that you can use either
SLIP or PPP and your choice of packet driver.  All the applications can be
set up by simply filling in the values your ISP provides.  Static IP, where
everything is fixed, is the least problem-prone situation for setting up DOS 
Internet applications.</p> <p>

Dynamic IP with a static gateway is next.  Here you will have to find ways
to pass your IP address to the various applications you use; of course, it
<em>is</em> possible to manually modify the configuration of each and every
application each and every time you connect, but you <em>really</em> don't
want to do that, do you ;-)?  You can use a combination of DOS environment
variables, batch files, and RARP or BOOTP (see <a href="#M">below</a>) to
pass the IP address to the applications.  You can use either SLIP or PPP,
but setup is more complicated than in the static IP case.</p> <p>

Dynamic IP with a dynamic gateway is the worst case.  Here you not only have
to pass <em>your</em> IP address to your applications, but your
<em>gateway's</em> IP address as well.  The only convenient way to handle
this situation is to get a PPP account and use Dospppd as your packet
driver, or use Nettamer.  If you have a dynamic gateway, it sometimes works
to pretend that you have a static one and give the gateway you
<em>usually</em> get when configuring applications.  Don't just give a
random number for the gateway, though; it needs to be a machine that
actually exists.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="F">What You Need to Find Out</a> </h3>

Ask your provider for your: <p></p>

<ul>
<li> Name of your machine (ex. mypc.foo.bar.net) (static IP only)</li>
<li> IP address of your machine (ex. 127.0.0.1) (static IP only)</li>
<li> Username (ex. myname) (email address would be myname@mypc.foo.bar.net)</li>
<li> Netmask (ex. 255.255.255.0) (mainly needed for Ethernet, but you should
     come up with something plausible to fill in)</li>
<li> Broadcast address (ex. 127.0.0.255) (mainly for Ethernet, but again
     you need to come up with something plausible)</li>
<li> Gateway name (ex. mygate.foo.bar.net) (machine you dial into) (if
     gateway is static)</li>
<li> Gateway IP address (ex. 127.0.0.2) (machine you dial into) (if gateway
     is static)</li>
<li> Nameserver IP address (ex. 127.0.0.3)</li>
<li> SMTP server name (ex. mailserv.foo.bar.net) (for outgoing mail)</li>
<li> POP server name (ex. mailserv.foo.bar.net) (for incoming mail)</li>
<li> NNTP server name (ex. newsserv.foo.bar.net) (for news)</li>
<li> POP and NNTP userids and passwords, if different from your usual ones</li>
<li> Time server IP address (ex. 127.0.0.2) (may be same as gateway)</li>
<li> File to get by ftp listing newsgroups carried by the NNTP server</li>
<li> If using PPP, whether your provider uses PAP or CHAP (or neither) for
     authentication, and the userid and password for that, if so</li>
<li> If using SLIP, whether your provider uses regular SLIP, compressed SLIP
     (CSLIP), or adaptive SLIP</li>
<li> Login sequence for your PPP or SLIP account</li>
</ul> <p>

If your provider tells you to get lost when you call their tech support line 
with these questions, you need to find another ISP.  Few ISP's support DOS  
directly, but they should be able to furnish you with the above information 
if they know what they're doing and care about their customers.  Not
everybody has Windows or Mac, and people who are running Linux or FreeBSD   
need this information as much as you do.</p> <p>

You can usually figure out the login sequence for your ISP by just calling
them with a regular communications program and seeing what you get; you will
use that information to write a dialing script for your packet driver or its
dialer.</p> <p>

If your provider does not have a file available listing the newsgroups they 
carry, it is possible to get such a list via telnet.  See file
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/cutcp-b.txt">cutcp-b.txt</a>
in this directory.</p> <p>

SLIP and CSLIP (SLIP with Van Jacobson compression) are different methods of
connecting to your ISP and use different packet drivers.  You need to know
which kind your ISP uses so you can select the right packet driver.  If your
provider has adaptive SLIP, though, that means that you can use either SLIP
or CSLIP and they will adjust on their end.</p> <p>

You might not need all this, depending on which applications you pick.
Nevertheless, you should find out as much as you can since you can mess up
the 'net if you get your settings wrong (which would make people very mad at
you - particularly getting the IP address or machine name wrong with static
IP).  It helps if your provider has a fair amount of patience as well :-),
but don't expect a lot of help from them since most providers only support
Windows and Mac nowadays.</p> <p>

If you want to know what some of the stuff above is, get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/tcpdocs.zip">tcpdocs.zip</a>.
TCPINTRO.DOC is a basic introduction to TCP/IP, the Internet protocol suite.
TCPADMIN.DOC contains more information for the terminally curious.
TCPIP1.FAQ, TCPIP2.FAQ, TCPIP3.FAQ, TCPIP4.FAQ, and TCPIP5.FAQ are parts 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 of the comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc FAQ.  This is an old
version from 1995; I can't find a newer one.  A lot of the stuff in the FAQ
is about Windows, but there is some on DOS as well.</p> <p>

Finally, don't imagine that you can get by without reading documentation.
<em>No</em> DOS Internet application works right out of the box.  You will
need to study the docs that come with each program to get things to work
right. I've written some .txt files that will hopefully be helpful as well. 
They include some special instructions for Agate Internet users; disregard
those instructions if you're not on Agate (the .txt files should still be
useful). I do not work for Agate Internet.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="G">Nettamer and Integrated Dialers</a> </h3>

The easiest way to proceed is to use <strong>Nettamer</strong>, which
requires a PPP account (it will not work with SLIP or an Ethernet card). 
Nettamer is an all-in-one program that needs no packet driver and supports
ftp, telnet, mail, news, WWW, ping, and finger (telnet and WWW leave a bit
to be desired).  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/n1092-xt.zip">n1092-xt.zip</a>,
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/n1092-xt.txt">n1092-xt.txt</a>,
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ntfaq.txt">ntfaq.txt</a>
for Nettamer.  This is not the newest version, which is at: <p></p>

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.nettamer.net/">
   http://www.nettamer.net/ </a> <p></p>
</blockquote>

In addition to Nettamer, the Bobcat and Arachne distributions (see below)
come with dialers and packet drivers.  I do <em>not</em> recommend that you
use them, though you can try them if you want.  There are three reasons for
that.  First, it is difficult enough to get dialed up and connected without
worrying about how to configure a complicated application at the same time. 
Second, if you use Bobcat or Arachne to dial your ISP and load your packet
driver, you are pretty much locked in to using Bobcat or Arachne for all
your Internet work.  Third, the batch files that Bobcat and Arachne use for
dialing and packet driver loading require DOS 5.0 or later (Bobcat comes
with some alternate batch files for DOS 3), though the programs themselves
will work with DOS 3.3.  So I say, take the long way around; the view is
better :-). <p>

Bobcat and Arachne use Dospppd for PPP and Slipper or Cslipper for SLIP, if 
you use their internal dialing capability.  Those are pretty good packet
driver choices.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="H">Packet Drivers (in General)</a> </h3>

If Nettamer doesn't meet your needs, or if you are using SLIP or an Ethernet
card, you need to get and install a packet driver, then get and install the
applications you want.  Some packet drivers, such as Etherppp, include an
internal dialer that will use a script you write to log into your ISP.
Others, such as Dospppd and Umslip, come with an external dialer that you
configure in much the same way. <p>

Some packet drivers, however, do not come with a dialer and assume that you
are already dialed in and connected before you load them.  For those
programs, you will need to get a dialer.  Any communications program can be
used as a dialer if it is capable of dialing the phone, logging you in, and
exiting while leaving DTR up (i.e., leaving the connection open).  I
personally prefer to use CHAT0.EXE, which comes with Dospppd.  Another
alternative would be PHONE.EXE, which comes with Umslip.</p> <p>

I also have two general-purpose dialers in this directory.  If you use
Bobcat to dial the phone (see <a href="#G">above</a>), it will use
<strong>Netdial</strong>, which is much simpler to write a script for than
CHAT0.EXE (though of course Netdial is less powerful).  Netdial uses the
same script syntax as Etherppp's internal dialer.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nd130.zip">nd130.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nd130.txt">nd130.txt</a>
for Netdial.</p> <p>

<strong>Comtool</strong> is a minimal command-line dialer that doesn't use a
script; you specify everything on the command line.  It might work for you
if your login sequence is simple.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/comtool.zip">comtool.zip</a>
for Comtool.</p> <p>

If you use PHONE.EXE as the dialer for your SLIP account (you can't use it
with PPP, AFAIK), you need to get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/tcpdocs.zip">tcpdocs.zip</a>.
There is a section in TCPIP1.FAQ on using packet drivers other than
UMSLIP.COM with PHONE.EXE.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="I">PPP Packet Drivers</a> </h3>

There are three packet driver choices for PPP.  The best PPP packet driver
around is probably <strong>Dospppd</strong>.  It is a more-or-less direct
port of the excellent Linux pppd program, including the chat dialer.  It
emulates either class 1 (Ethernet) or class 6 (SLIP).  Dospppd takes about
half as much RAM as either Etherppp or Klos, appears to be much faster, and
works with every application I tested it with.  Setting up this one will be
easier if you've used its Linux cousin, or know someone who has (though the
included documentation is quite good).  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/dosppp06.zip">dosppp06.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/dosppp06.txt">dosppp06.txt</a>
for Dospppd.  One of the best features of Dospppd, if you have dynamic IP,
is that it automatically creates a batch file named IP-UP.BAT at connect
time that can be used to set environment variables for your local and
gateway IP addresses.  Dospppd supports BOOTP, but not RARP. <p>

If you find it difficult to select an init string or write a Chat script for
Dospppd, you might try <strong>Alfredo Cole's Dospppd setup
package</strong>.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/setup.zip">setup.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/cole.txt">cole.txt</a>
for that.</p> <p>

Before Toni Lopez wrote Dospppd, I used to use <strong>Etherppp</strong>; get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ethernew.zip">ethernew.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ethernew.txt">ethernew.txt</a>.
Etherppp emulates Ethernet (class 1).  Etherppp works well enough for most
applications, but it doesn't support modems faster than 14.4k.  Etherppp
supports both BOOTP and RARP.</p> <p>

Marc Williams has switched to Dospppd also, but he started out using
Quakeppp.  It is no longer available, but a newer version of the
<strong>Klos</strong> packet driver in Quakeppp can be downloaded from:</p> <p></p>

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://ftp.klos.com/">http://ftp.klos.com/</a> <br>
   <a href="http://www.klos.com/">http://www.klos.com/</a> <p></p>
</blockquote>

The packet driver is named PPPSHARE.  Klos's PPP can also emulate Ethernet. 
You should also get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/klosppp.txt">klosppp.txt</a>
from my site for instructions on setting up Klos PPP.  Klos works best if
you have a newer modem with a 16550 UART, or if you have a 386 or above. 
Klos PPP requires DOS 3.3 or later.  Recent versions of Klos PPP won't work
on my machine any more, but last I heard it supported BOOTP, though that was
problem-prone.  There is a program included for configuring WATTCP
applications that may or may not work.  I don't know about RARP. <p>

Note:  if you are connecting via PPP and your provider requires CHAP
authentication, you can't use Etherppp.  You will need to get either Dospppd
(preferable) or the <strong>demo version of Klos PPP</strong>, named PPPDEMO
and available at the Klos sites above.  It is time-limited to 15 minutes of
connect time, so if decide to use it you will ultimately want to buy the
full version of Klos.  (Nettamer supports CHAP also, if you use that.)</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="J">SLIP Packet Drivers</a> </h3>

There are several packet driver choices for SLIP also. 
<strong>Umslip</strong> is a class 6 (SLIP) driver; get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/sliparc.zip">sliparc.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/sliparc.txt">sliparc.txt</a>
for Umslip.  Umslip comes with a dialer, which other SLIP drivers do not,
but it has nothing else to recommend it.  Several applications require a
class 1 packet driver and will not work with class 6. <p>

<strong>Slipper</strong> and <strong>Cslipper</strong> can emulate
class 1 and are compatible with more applications.  SLIPPER.EXE is the
packet driver for regular SLIP, and CSLIPPER.EXE is the driver for
compressed SLIP (CSLIP).  They are both in the same archive; get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/slippr15.zip">slippr15.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/slippr15.txt">slippr15.txt</a>
for them.  They do not come with a dialer, so you need to get one (see
<a href="#H">above</a>).  Slipper and Cslipper support BOOTP, but there is
no configuration file to set the nameserver or netmask.  It appears that for
BOOTP to work with these drivers, your ISP must have server-side BOOTP
support on their end.  (Cisco servers can provide BOOTP over a SLIP link.)
Marc has used Cslipper successfully.</p> <p>

<strong>Frank Molzahn</strong> has written a pair of very small packet
drivers for SLIP and CSLIP.  They emulate class 1 and support RARP but not
BOOTP (the RARP here is an emulation; you need to use Ipread to get the IP
address to configure it).  They don't come with a dialer.  Frank is
requesting feedback on the drivers if you try them; his email address is in
the documentation.  Get

<h3> <a name="K">Other Packet Drivers</a> </h3>

If you're connected to a local area network with an actual Ethernet card
in your machine, you can probably find a packet driver for it in the
<strong>Crynwr/Clarkson packet driver set</strong>.  As noted above, I'm
not going to dwell much on Ethernet setup - ask your LAN administrator for
help.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pktd11.zip">pktd11.zip</a>

<h3> <a name="L">Applications (in General)</a> </h3>

After you've figured out how to dial out and get your packet driver to load,
you select the applications you want and set them up.  This is the time when
you really wish you had static IP, but you can get dynamic IP to work with
any application, it's just a little more trouble. <p>

For dynamic IP, you will generally have to set DOS environment variables in
batch files.  When you do that, you may get the message, &quot;Out of
environment space&quot; from DOS.  If that happens, you need to edit your
CONFIG.SYS file and use the SHELL= command to increase the environment
space, like this:</p> <p>

<pre>   SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /E:1024 /P
</pre>

Check your DOS manual and make sure that you know what that means; it should
work as is for most people, but it depends on where you have COMMAND.COM
installed.  Whenever you modify CONFIG.SYS, for this or any other reason,
always check the changes using a bootable floppy before you change
CONFIG.SYS on your hard drive.</p> <p>

Whether you have static or dynamic IP, you may also need to modify
CONFIG.SYS to increase the maximum number of open files.  You use a line
like this to do that:</p> <p>

<pre>   FILES=20
</pre>

Perhaps a little about how DOS Internet works is in order.  The Internet
uses a layered model, where each layer of software runs on top of and uses
services provided by the layer below.  The lowest layer is the hardware
itself, in your case, your modem, the phone line, and your ISP's modem.  On
top of that, you have a driver for the hardware, in your case, your packet
driver.  So far it is the same as on any other operating system.</p> <p>

Next comes the TCP/IP stack.  This is where it gets different.  Technically,
IP runs on top of the hardware driver, and TCP runs on top of IP.
Generally, though, IP and TCP are integrated into the same piece of
software, called a TCP/IP stack.  Under Windows, the TCP/IP stack is usually
Trumpet Winsock.  Under Linux, the TCP/IP stack is integrated into the
operating system kernel.  Under DOS, however, the TCP/IP stack may either be
integrated into the application or be a separate TSR that you must load.</p> <p>

To run an Internet application, you must first configure its TCP/IP stack,
telling the application or its TSR what your IP address is, your nameserver,
your gateway, your netmask, and other things.  Hence, how you configure an
application mainly depends on the TCP/IP stack it uses, and applications
that use the same stack are configured similarly.  The four major TCP/IP
stacks used by DOS applications are WATTCP, Trumpet TCP, the University of
Minnesota stack, and the NCSA/CUTCP stack.</p> <p>

Over half of all DOS Internet programs use the WATTCP stack.  In their case,
the stack is integrated into the application.  To configure them, you edit a
file usually called WATTCP.CFG (for Doslynx it is called DOSLYNX.CFG, and
for Arachne, LANTCP.CFG).  WATTCP does not support RARP, and BOOTP does not
work with it over a SLIP or PPP link (because of problems with the netmask). 
To configure these applications for dynamic IP you will have to set
environment variables for your IP address and if necessary your gateway
address as well, then create a batch file that uses those variables to
generate files that can be included into WATTCP.CFG.  To illustrate: I load
Dospppd as my packet driver, and it generates the file IP-UP.BAT.  I then
run IP-UP.BAT, which sets the following DOS environment variables:</p> <p></p>

<blockquote>
   MYIP (my local IP address) <br>
   REMIP (the IP address of my gateway) <br>
   NETMASK (my netmask) <br>
   PEERMRU (the largest PPP packet the gateway will accept) <p></p>
</blockquote>

To configure WATTCP applications, I need MYIP and (if my gateway is dynamic
also) REMIP; the others don't matter.  I make a batch file like this and run
it next: <p>

<pre>   echo my_ip=%MYIP% &gt; ipaddr.cfg
   echo gateway=%REMIP% &gt; gateway.cfg
</pre>

That creates two files, IPADDR.CFG and GATEWAY.CFG, which look like this
(for me):</p> <p>

<pre>   my_ip=205.183.16.48
</pre>

(for IPADDR.CFG) and</p> <p>

<pre>   gateway=199.191.1.70
</pre>

(for GATEWAY.CFG).  Now when I edit my WATTCP.CFG file and it asks me to set
the my_ip parameter, I comment out that line and put this instead:</p> <p>

<pre>   include=ipaddr.cfg
</pre>

Similarly, where it asks me to set the gateway, I comment that out and put
this:</p> <p>

<pre>   include=gateway.cfg
</pre>

Now, assuming I've configured the rest of WATTCP.CFG and whatever else that
particular application may require, I can run WATTCP applications in my
dynamic IP setup.  Of course, if I had static IP (as I really do) there
would be no need for me to go through all that rigamarole.  All I would have
to do is just type my static IP and gateway addresses into WATTCP.CFG along
with the other stuff in there, and I'd be ready to go.  I've constructed
what I call &quot;the ultimate WATTCP.CFG file&quot; containing all the
variables required or used by the various applications; get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/mywattcp.zip">mywattcp.zip</a>
to look at it.</p> <p>

The Trumpet TCP/IP stack, unlike WATTCP, is generally loaded as a separate
TSR (NTCPDRV.EXE).  The applications then use the TSR to connect to the
Internet.  Trumpet IRC (IRC 1.01) and Ping, however, do not use the TSR; the
Trumpet TCP stack is integrated into them.  In either case, DOS environment
variables are used for configuration:</p> <p></p>

<blockquote>
   IP (your IP address) <br>
   NETMASK (your netmask) <br>
   GATEWAY (your gateway's IP address) <br>
   DNS (your nameserver's IP address) <br>
   MSS (largest packet you will agree to receive) <br>
   RWIN (size of buffer for incoming packets) <br>
   DOMAIN (your domain - optional, see below) <br>
   TZ (your time zone - optional, see below) <p></p>
</blockquote>

If you have static IP, you can just set these variables in AUTOEXEC.BAT and
forget about it.  In any case, your netmask, nameserver, mss, rwin, domain
and timezone should be constants, so you can set <em>them</em> in
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  MSS and RWIN should be set to 512.  This prevents packet
fragmentation and is necessary with Frank Molzahn's SLIP drivers. <p>

As noted above, if you use Dospppd and you run the IP-UP.BAT it generates,
it will set MYIP, NETMASK, and REMIP for you.  To convert MYIP and REMIP to
IP and GATEWAY as Trumpet TCP requires, you can make a batch file like this:</p>
<p>

<pre>   set ip=%MYIP%
   set gateway=%REMIP%
</pre>

DOMAIN is your domain.  Normally, that is the part of your machine name
after the first dot.  For example, my PC is jhayes.buckeyeweb.com.  I would
set DOMAIN to &quot;buckeyeweb.com&quot;.  You don't really need to set
DOMAIN, however, and it is probably better if you don't (speeds up DNS
queries).</p> <p>

TZ is your time zone.  This is a three-letter code, followed by a number
indicating the offset from Greenwich Mean Time, optionally followed by a
three-letter code for daylight savings time (if it's summer). It is not
terribly important, and you can leave it out.  If you want to set it,
however, this is for the east coast of the U.S.:</p> <p>

<pre>   SET TZ=EST5EDT
</pre>

The Trumpet newsreader naturally uses the Trumpet TCP stack, but it does not
use the TSR or the environment variables; instead, you configure it from
inside the application.  A configuration file, NEWS.PRM, is generated.  To
use the newsreader with dynamic IP, you need to make a batch file for it
specifying command-line options to override the settings in the file, like
this:</p> <p>

<pre>   news -myip=%MYIP% -gateway=%REMIP%
</pre>

Finally, it could be said that Trumpet applications support BOOTP, but only
if the IP and MYIP environment variables are <em>not</em> set (the
-myip=bootp command-line option is ignored).  I find that sort of behavior
too screwy to deal with and just use the variables.</p> <p>

The University of Minnesota applications are Minuet, POPmail, and PC Gopher
III.  You configure them from inside the application, which contains the
TCP/IP stack.  How you configure them for dynamic IP depends on the
application.</p> <p>

First, you can leave the IP address, Net mask, Gateway, and Name Server
settings blank in the dialog box - in the case of PC Gopher III, there is a
Use BOOTP box that must be checked (by default it is).  That will cause a
University of Minnesota application to use BOOTP, which will work with
Dospppd and sometimes Slipper, Cslipper, or Umslip, but not with other BOOTP
emulations (like Etherppp's).  There is a bug in the BOOTP support of UMinn
applications which requires a workaround in the BOOTP server.</p> <p>

Otherwise, for Minuet only, if you have dynamic IP and BOOTP doesn't work,
leave the IP address, Net mask, and Gateway blank, but fill in the Name
Server.  Minuet will get the local IP address from the MYIP environment
variable and assume a point-to-point connection so that the netmask and
gateway are not needed (everything goes out the PPP or SLIP link).  Of
course, if you have IP set instead of MYIP, you can set MYIP in a batch file
like this:</p> <p>

<pre>   set myip=%IP%
</pre>

For PC Gopher III only, if you have dynamic IP and BOOTP doesn't work, then
leave the IP address, Net mask, Gateways, and Nameservers blank in the
dialog box, and <em>uncheck</em> the Use BOOTP box.  Exit Gopher, and edit
GOPHER.INI by hand to include these settings:</p> <p>

<pre>   pc_ip = %MYIP
   nameserver_1 = 204.254.98.2
</pre>

(Use your nameserver's IP address.)  This will get your IP address from the
MYIP environment variable, as for Minuet.  The gateway and netmask do not
need to be set; PC Gopher III will default to a point-to-point link.</p> <p>

Using BOOTP with Dospppd appears to be the only way to configure POPmail for
dynamic IP.  Minuet will work for both gopher and email, however.</p> <p>

Finally, we have the NCSA and CUTCP applications.  They use an integral
TCP/IP stack and are configured by editing a file usually named CONFIG.TEL.
(CUTCP's is slightly different from NCSA's.) To configure them for dynamic  
IP, you can use either BOOTP or RARP, depending on which your packet driver 
supports.  BOOTP is probably preferable, since if you use that you don't
need to configure the netmask, gateway, or nameserver in the file.  Set
myip=BOOTP or myip=RARP in CONFIG.TEL.</p> <p>

CUTCP (but not NCSA) also supports include files and environment variables
to set the local IP address.  The environment variable can be set like this:</p>
<p>

<pre>   set $cutcp1=myip~%MYIP%
</pre>

You also need to set DOS environment variables to point to the CONFIG.TEL
files (whether or not you have dynamic IP), for example:</p> <p>

<pre>   SET CONFIG.TEL=E:\INTERNET\TEL2308B\CONFIG.TEL
   SET CONFIGTEL=E:\INTERNET\CUTCP-B\CONFIG.TEL
</pre>

(The first line is for NCSA, the second for CUTCP.)  You can just put those
two lines in AUTOEXEC.BAT.  CUTCP, but not NCSA, will also find CONFIG.TEL  
in the current directory if CONFIGTEL is not set.</p> <p>

Some applications (Bobcat and Arachne, for example) require that you be in
the directory where you installed them to run them.  Others (Dospppd, CUTCP)
will run from any directory if you put them in the PATH and configure them
correctly.  I always change to the directory where I've installed a program 
before I run it.  You can automate such directory changes with batch files,
of course.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="M">BOOTP, RARP, and Reading from the Screen</a> </h3>

By now you must be wondering what the hell I'm talking about with
&quot;BOOTP&quot; and &quot;RARP.&quot; They are protocols that can be used
to pass information about the local TCP/IP parameters from the packet driver
to the application.  Both protocols originated with diskless workstations on
an Ethernet, and both normally require a class 1 (Ethernet emulation) packet
driver to work.  Both the packet driver and the application must support the
protocol for you to use it. <p>

BOOTP and RARP can be useful if you have dynamic IP.  With BOOTP, the packet
driver provides the application with the IP addresses of the PC, the
gateway, the nameserver, and the netmask.  With RARP, the packet driver
provides the PC's IP address.</p> <p>

Dospppd creates IP-UP.BAT to set the MYIP environment variable for dynamic
IP configuration.  But how do you set the variable if you're not using
Dospppd?  If you have RARP, <strong>Iprarp</strong> and
<strong>Rarpset</strong> can get the PC's IP address from the packet driver
by RARP.  Iprarp creates a batch file that sets a DOS environment variable
to the IP address; Rarpset directly sets an environment variable.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ipcfg010.zip">ipcfg010.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ipcfg.txt">ipcfg.txt</a>
for Iprarp, and get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/rarpset.zip">rarpset.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ipcfg.txt">ipcfg.txt</a>
for Rarpset.</p> <p>

If you are using Klos PPP, it comes with a program PPPWAT.EXE that can
create or modify WATTCP.CFG for your dynamic IP configuration.  If you have
such an automatically generated WATTCP.CFG file (and WATTCP apps work with
it), <strong>Watbat</strong> can extract values from the file and create a
batch file to set corresponding DOS environment variables for your other
apps.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/watbat.zip">watbat.zip</a>
for Watbat.</p> <p>

<strong>Ipread</strong> is another program that can be useful with dynamic
addressing, particularly if your packet driver doesn't support RARP.  It
reads the IP address from the screen at connect time and creates a batch
file that sets a DOS environment variable to that address.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ipcfg010.zip">ipcfg010.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ipcfg.txt">ipcfg.txt</a>
for Ipread.</p> <p>

If you use BOOTP to configure your applications, remember that the BOOTP
support provided by the PPP packet drivers is an <em>emulation</em>.  In
particular, the packet drivers will not know where your nameserver is if you
do not tell them, so be sure to configure that, for example by including the
&quot;nameserver&quot; line in CONFIG.PPP with Etherppp, or the
&quot;namsrv&quot; line in PPPD.CFG with Dospppd.  With Etherppp, but not
Dospppd, you also need to configure the gateway, using the
&quot;gateway&quot; line in CONFIG.PPP.  It is a good idea to explicitly
specify the netmask as well.</p> <p>

Similarly, the RARP support in Frank Molzahn's drivers is an emulation, and
you need to set the IP address on the command line for it.  You can use
Ipread to automate the process.</p> <p>

Note that BOOTP doesn't seem to work that way with Slipper, Cslipper, or
Umslip.  Those programs must be getting the local address, gateway, netmask,
and nameserver from the ISP somehow, since there is no configuration
required for them.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="N">Application Suites</a> </h3>

A good application to start with is <strong>Minuet</strong>; it may be all
you need.  Minuet provides ftp, telnet, mail, news, WWW (graphical if you
have EGA or VGA, but that works best if you have a 386 or better), gopher,
finger, ping, and nslookup, with context-sensitive online help, mouse
support, and many other features. It supports both class 1 and 6 packet
drivers.  Note: the news module in Minuet won't work if your provider
carries a huge number of newsgroups or if you have a compressed drive.  Get

and 
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/minuarc.txt">minuarc.txt</a> 
for Minuet.  Etherppp or Dospppd might work better with Minuet than Klos. <p>

<strong>NCSA Telnet</strong> provides telnet, ftp, finger, whois, rsh,
rexec, rcp, lpr, lpq, and lprm.  rcp and ftp can operate in server mode
when telnet is running. The telnet offers a complete, configurable VT100
emulation including Tektronics 4014 graphics mode on Hercules, CGA, EGA,
or VGA.  You can have multiple telnet sessions going simultaneously.  Note:
these applications can't resolve domain names, and you have to specify IP
addresses, either on the command line or in the configuration file.  NCSA
Telnet supports class 1 packet drivers only, so it won't work with Umslip.

for NCSA Telnet.</p> <p>

<strong>CUTCP Telnet</strong> is an offshoot of the NCSA Telnet package and
is set up similarly.  It provides telnet, tn3270, ftp, ping, lpr, lpq, and
lprm, and it seems to deal with domain names better than NCSA Telnet.  Like
that package, CUTCP Telnet offers a complete VT100 emulation and supports
incoming ftp during a telnet session.  It supports both class 1 and 6 packet
drivers.  Get

as well.</p> <p>

<strong>Trumpet TCP</strong> (not to be confused with the Trumpet
newsreader, from the same people) is a set of Internet applications using an
included TSR to interface with the packet driver.  Both class 1 and class 6
are supported.  The applications are:  telnet, ftp, finger, ping, archie,
whois, hopchk (traceroute), and ichat (similar to Unix talk, apparently, but
incompatible).  The archie in this package is the only working DOS archie
client I've found, but the other stuff doesn't work all that well.  Dospppd
and Klos PPP work better with these than Etherppp.  Get

for Trumpet TCP.  The Trumpet TCP apps work best with Slipper or Cslipper.</p> <p>

The <strong>WATTCP applications</strong> are the &quot;example&quot; apps
that come with the Waterloo TCP development package, plus ftp.  They include
a fortune cookie client, two time clients, finger, lpr, lpq, ping, rexec,
talk, a phonebook client, a POP mail retriever, a program that sets up a TCP
connection to mimic a serial port (so that you could use a regular
communcations program as a telnet client, for example), and of course ftp.

<strong>Pegasus Mail</strong> has got to be the ultimate DOS email client. 
(It includes basic MIME support and can control an automated mailing list,
among other things.)  Pegasus Mail has menus (but does not support a mouse)
and comes with a great deal of documentation.  It requires a class 1 packet

I don't have the latest Pegasus Mail, but there is no advantage to the
newest one if you're not on a Novell network, and it takes more memory than
the version I have.  If you have problems retrieving mail from your POP
server, you can try using <strong>Smtpop</strong> with Pegasus.  Smtpop is
somewhat more sophisticated but less convenient than the default setup.  Get

<h3> <a name="Q">WWW Browsers</a> </h3>

<strong>Doslynx</strong> is a text-based Web browser; it requires DOS 3.0 or

Doslynx; better to use Dospppd or Klos PPP with this one. <p>

<strong>Bobcat</strong> is a good text-based WWW browser, successor to
Doslynx, and very similar to Unix Lynx.  It requires DOS 3.3 or later.  Klos
PPP or Dospppd work better with it than Etherppp.  Bobcat is highly

<strong>Arachne</strong> is a graphical WWW browser, and yes, it will run on
an XT, albeit slowly.  It requires DOS 3.3 or later.  You must have EGA or
better video and a mouse.  At least some EMS is strongly recommended, and
for best results, 640x480x256 SVGA or better is required.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/arcn14b2.exe">arcn14b2.exe</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/arcn14b2.txt">arcn14b2.txt</a>
for Arachne.  Arachne almost requires a hard drive cache; if you don't have
one, but you have some EMS to use for one, get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/adcsh122.zip">adcsh122.zip</a>.
Arachne is under active development; if I'm out of date, you can get the
latest version from: <p></p>

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://arachne.browser.org/">
   http://arachne.browser.org/ </a> <p></p>
</blockquote>

There are also some Arachne plugins (telnet, etc.) to be found there.  One
such plugin is
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/extedit.exe">extedit.exe</a>.
This one you have to install yourself, though - I'm not allowed to have APM
files on my site. <p></p>

<h3> <a name="R">News Readers</a> </h3>

<strong>Trumpet</strong> is a nice news reader that supports both class
1 and class 6, and you can get it to work with sites that carry huge
numbers of groups (with a little fiddling).  It has windows and menus and
supports a mouse.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/trmp106b.zip">trmp106b.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/trmp106b.txt">trmp106b.txt</a>
for Trumpet.  The newsreader has not been updated in a while, but if you
want to visit Trumpet's site, the URL is: <p></p>

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.trumpet.com.au/">
   http://www.trumpet.com.au/ </a> <p></p>
</blockquote>

Despite what they say, the newsreader <em>does</em> work with PPP.  Trumpet
doesn't contain any capability of dealing with uuencoded or MIME-encoded
messages, so if you're interested in binary newsgroups, you'll need
decoders.  For a uudecoder, get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/uuexe656.zip">uuexe656.zip</a>.
To decode MIME under DOS, get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/mpack15d.zip">mpack15d.zip</a>.
<p></p>

<h3> <a name="S">IRC Clients</a> </h3>

<strong>IRC</strong> is an Internet Relay Chat client; Internet Relay
Chat is a way of conducting multiuser discussions over the Internet (like
forums on a BBS).  It supports both class 1 and class 6 packet drivers. 
The program has menus, scrollable windows, and mouse support.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/irc101.zip">irc101.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/irc101.txt">irc101.txt</a>
for IRC.  The #dos channel on Efnet is a good place to discuss DOS Internet
stuff.  Mark Williams is a frequent visitor there; his nick is Senshi. <p>

<strong>Voice</strong> is another Internet Relay Chat client.  You might
like this one better if you're used to ircII on Unix; it can also connect
to more sites than IRC101.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/voice11b.zip">voice11b.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/voice11b.txt">voice11b.txt</a>
for Voice.</p> <p>

<strong>jpIRC</strong> is the best DOS IRC client around.  It includes ident
and CTCP PING support, which enables it to connect to many sites that IRC101
and Voice will not.  It can also receive (but not send) files by /dcc and
check periodically for incoming mail, and you can shell out of it.  jpIRC is
a Trumpet TCP application, so you need to get Trumpet TCP set up first (see
<a href="#N">above</a>).  As a Trumpet TCP application, it supports both
class 1 and 6.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/jpirc.zip">jpirc.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/jpirc.txt">jpirc.txt</a>
for jpIRC.</p> <p></p>

<h3> <a name="T">Miscellaneous Applications</a> </h3>

<strong>Ping</strong> is a ping client (as you might have guessed).  It
didn't come with any documentation, but it appears to be a Trumpet TCP
application with integral stack (i.e., you don't need NTCPDRV.EXE for it). 
It supports both class 1 and 6 packet drivers.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ping.exe">ping.exe</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/ping.txt">ping.txt</a>
for Ping; ping.exe is the actual program, not an archive.  This one is
pretty simple and makes a good program to test your packet driver with. <p>

<strong>Nslookup</strong> is a simple application that looks up the IP
address for a domain name or vice versa.  It didn't come with any
documentation.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nslookup.zip">nslookup.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nslookup.txt">nslookup.txt</a>
for Nslookup.</p> <p>

<strong>BSD Nslookup/Nsquery</strong> is a direct port of those applications
from Berkeley Unix.  They require a class 1 packet driver.  While they can
be used in the same way as the Nslookup above, they do much more, though you
need to be pretty well-informed to use the advanced features.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nslb01a.zip">nslb01a.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/nslb01a.txt">nslb01a.txt</a>
for BSD Nslookup/Nsquery.</p> <p>

<strong>PC Gopher III</strong> is a gopher client with menus, scrollable
windows, and mouse support.  It supports both class 1 and class 6 packet
drivers, but it requires DOS 3.3 or later.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pcg3bin.zip">pcg3bin.zip</a>,
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pcg3doc.zip">pcg3doc.zip</a>,
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pcg3note.txt">pcg3note.txt</a>
for PC Gopher III.</p> <p>

<strong>Talk</strong> is a DOS version of the Unix talk program for
2-way interactive communication over the Internet.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/talk-13.zip">talk-13.zip</a>
for Talk.  It is a WATTCP application and is set up similarly.</p> <p>

<strong>Pcfsp</strong> is an FSP client.  FSP is sometimes used in place
of FTP to transfer files over the Internet.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pcfsp105.txt">pcfsp105.txt</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/pcfsp105.zip">pcfsp105.zip</a>
for Pcfsp.</p> <p>

<strong>MudCaller</strong> is a MUD client (i.e., telnet with macros for
connecting to a MUD).  It doesn't seem to work very well.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/slip_mud.zip">slip_mud.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/slip_mud.txt">slip_mud.txt</a>
if you want to try it anyway.</p> <p>

<strong>Jeff Patterson</strong> (author of jpIRC) has also written some
clients for telnet, nslookup, and finger.  Like jpIRC, they are Trumpet TCP
applications, so you need to set up Trumpet TCP first.  The telnet doesn't
work for me, but nslookup and finger do (these programs don't come with any
documentation).  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/tn102.zip">tn102.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/tn102.txt">tn102.txt</a>
for Jeff Patterson's clients.</p> <p>

<strong>Trout</strong> is a traceroute (hopcheck) client for DOS,
essentially a clone of Unix traceroute.  It requires a class 1 packet
driver.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/trtb01b.zip">trtb01b.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/trtb01b.txt">trtb01b.txt</a>
for Trout.</p> <p>

If you are interested in Web authoring, two tools you can use are Htget
and Knots.  <strong>Htget</strong> is a command-line HTTP retriever; get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/htget102.zip">htget102.zip</a>
and
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/htget102.txt">htget102.txt</a>
for it.  <strong>Knots</strong> is a graphical HTML viewer.  It only
supports a small subset of HTML codes, but it will work with any graphics
card, even CGA or Hercules.  It uses an &quot;FAT&quot; file to convert URL
links to local filenames.  Get
<a href="http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/internet/knots2_0.zip">knots2_0.zip</a>
for Knots.  Note that Knots is not a browser - if you need a browser, use
Doslynx, Bobcat or Arachne instead.</p> <p></p>

While not precisely Internet-related, Eko Priono's <strong>386 software
emulator</strong> can be useful.  It requires a 286.  It may permit you to
run some applications that normally require a 386: <p></p>
