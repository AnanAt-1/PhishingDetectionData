				Benjamin K. Piilani (born June 04, 1980 in Centralia, Illinois) is the current Chairman of the board and Chief Executive of American Holding Company Unified Technologies Group, Inc.<br /><br /><b> Biography </b><br /><br />Piilani started his career in 1996 in the Telecom Arena with Voice over Internet technologies (VoIP), while it was still yet in its infancy as a technology, with Unlimited Telecom.  Unlimited Telecom deployed a commercially viable, dial around VoIP system to compete in the "Long Distance" market.  Due to the complete lack of residential  high speed Internet access, Unlimited Telecom used the consumers existing telephone carrier's network to allow customers to make long distance calls.  It was the first commercially released, " Flat-Rate" telecom service in the United States market.<br /><br />In 1998, Piilani launched his first Internet based company "Internet Business Advertisement Directory" ("I.B.A.D." www.ibad.com - now defunct).  IBAD was a search engine that was able to identify the location of the user, and produce relevant, geographically based results for the client and paid for by the advertising businesses.  This allowed businesses looking to market online only to consumers that would benefit the business.  Consumers were not driven to businesses that were out of their geographic location.  This benefited both, the consumer as well as the advertising business.  IBAD eventually succumb to the market pressures of the "AOL, Yahoo, Google" era. <br /><br />In 2001 Piilani launched I-Net Solutions, Inc. ("I-NET"), a hardware, software, and networking company that operated under the trade names of "Piilani Computers" and "INS Communications." I-NET catered to large commercial, health care, municipal, and educational projects for any IT related software, networking, ISP services, and equipment.  I-NET's core product was the "Piilani Computer" line.  Manufacturing white box, ISO 9000 compliant computers for its clientele.  Through I-NET, Piilani was able to establish many industry relationships that are still considered part of  core background today. <br /><br />In 2003, Piilani formed Unified Technologies Group, Inc.  Piilani now currently resides as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Unified Technologies Group, Inc., which acquired I-Net Solutions, Inc. in 2003, and is classified as a " Diversified Conglomerate," with a vested interest in many areas of Communications and Technology from VoIP and IPTV to Broadband over Power Lines,  Mobile Applications, and content creation and distribution.  In addition,  Unified Technologies Group has vested interests in many other areas as well, including, but not limited to International Financial Services, Manufacturing, Alternative Energy Technologies, and Real Estate.

Piilani also has existing relationships within the European Union and Asia.<br /><br />Piilani has developed relationships with many fortune 500 companies, both domestically and internationally such as  Advance Micro Devices ("AMD"), Boeing, Agilent Technologies, and Rhode and Schwarz.  In addition, his relationships extend internationally with  Electric Utilities,  Mobile Carriers, Commercial and Residential Developers, International Finance, IT, Manufacturing, Film, Television, and Internet Content creation and distribution.<br /><br />Piilani has focused on building the corporate infrastructure needed to maintain  rapid growth as a company and on ensuring that quality remains high while product development cycle times are kept to a minimum.
