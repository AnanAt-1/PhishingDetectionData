		<P><B>William Brandt</B></P>
		<P><B>William Jeans Brandt</B>, professor emeritus of rhetoric, died April 27 at his home in
		Pleasant Hill. He was 80. </P>
		<P>Brandt co-founded the Bay Area Writing Project in 1973, served
		as assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science from 1974
		to 1976, and chaired the Department of Rhetoric from 1977 to 1979.
		He retired in 1986.</P>
		<P>He received his BA in English from UCLA in 1949 and his PhD in
		English from Berkeley in 1956. He joined the faculty in 1965 as
		an associate professor, after teaching at Ohio State and San Jose
		State.</P>
		<P>Brandt is survived by his wife, Kimberly, and three children,
		Elizabeth, Jane and David.</P>
		<P><B>Jack Kent</B></P>
		<P>City and Regional Planning Professor Emeritus T. J. (Jack) Kent
		died Sunday, April 26, of heart failure and a long struggle with
		Alzheimer&#146;s disease.</P>
		<P>Kent was the founder and first chair of the Department of City
		and Regional Planning, established in l948. A faculty member for
		30 years, he served as department chair for 12. When he retired
		in 1974, he was awarded the Berkeley Citation.</P>
		<P>Kent was active in the formation of the College of Environmental
		Design, founded in 1959. </P>
		<P>He was a member of the Berkeley City Planning Commission from
		1948 to 1957 and a Berkeley City Council member from 1957 to 1965.
		He was the second city planning director for the City of San Francisco
		and wrote the city&#146;s first master plan.</P>
		<P>In the early 1960s, Kent helped organize the Association of Bay
		Area Governments. He served as president of People for Open Space
		and president of the American Society of Planning Officials, receiving
		the society&#146;s Gold Medal Award in 1975.</P>
		<P>His publications include &#147;The Urban General Plan,&#148; published in
		1964 and still in print.</P>
		<P>Kent received his bachelor&#146;s degree in architecture from Berkeley
		in 1938 and a master&#146;s in city planning from M.I.T. in 1943.</P>
		<P>&#147;Most of all I will remember Jack for educating me about the college
		in my first months here at Berkeley,&#148; said Harrison Fraker, dean
		of the College of Environmental Design (CED). &#147;His insights were
		invaluable as I learned about the history of CED.</P>
		<P>&#147;His death is particularly poignant,&#148; Fraker continued, &#147;as he
		was to have been one of four CED alumni to receive the CED/CED
		Alumni Association Distinguished Alumnus Award at graduation May
		24, the first time such an award has been given in the history
		of the college. Certainly his ideas and spirit will continue to
		be a guiding presence in the evolution of the college.&#148;</P>
		<P>The Department of City and Regional Planning&#146;s 50th Anniversary
		Celebration the weekend of May 9-10 was dedicated to Kent&#146;s memory.
		A tribute by three of his colleagues, Allan Jacobs, Larry Orman
		and Joel Rubenzahl, opened the proceedings. The department also
		mounted an exhibition in honor of Kent as part of the weekend
		activities. </P>
		<P><B>Sunny Low</B></P>
		<P><B>Sunny Low</B> died April 27, at the age of 66.</P>
		<P>Low dedicated his skills to the campus for more than 30 years,
		serving as associate registrar in the Office of Admissions and
		Records and the Office of the Registrar before retiring in 1992.</P>
		<P>&#147;Sunny approached his job in a very principled way,&#148; recalled
		LaVern Lazzereschi, a senior administrative analyst in the Office
		of the Registrar. &#147;He cared deeply for each person who worked
		with him. You could always talk to Sunny about anything, even
		the most personal or painful problems.&#148;</P>
		<P>Senior administrative analyst Russell Low (no relation), who worked
		for Low for many years, said, &#147;Nothing pleased him more than to
		see his staff get promoted or to move on to bigger and better
		things.&#148;</P>
		<P>Low was a member of the Order of the Golden Bear and a founding
		member of the Asian and Pacific American Systemwide Alliance.
		In recognition of his contributions to campus, the Alliance later
		created the Sunny Low Outstanding Service Award, presented annually
		to recog-nize extraordinary service to the campus community and
		members of APASA.</P>
		<P>Low is survived by his wife, Mabel, a former staff member in the
		ASUC executive director&#146;s office, a son and daughter, two grandchildren,
		three brothers and three sisters.</P>
		<P>For information on making a memorial donation, call Walter Wong
		at 643-1640.</P>
		<P><B>Yakov Malkiel</B></P>
		<P><B>Yakov Malkiel</B>, professor emeritus of linguistics and romance philology, died
		April 24 of a heart attack. He was 83.</P>
		<P>Malkiel was born in Kiev in 1914, but civil war forced the family
		to move to Berlin. As a Jew in prewar Germany, he overcame serious
		difficulties before he was admitted into Berlin&#146;s Friedrich-Wilhelms
		Universitat, earning his PhD in Romance linguistics, magna cum
		laude, in 1938.</P>
		<P>In 1940 he emigrated with his parents to the United States, and
		in 1942 joined Berkeley&#146;s faculty as a lecturer. Later he became
		assistant professor of Spanish and Portuguese, then professor
		of romance philology. In 1952 he helped found the Department of
		Linguistics, and in 1965 became a member of that department, where
		he taught until his retirement.</P>
		<P>In 1948, Malkiel married Mar&iacute;a Rosa Lida, a scholar from Argentina.
		After her untimely death in 1962, he devoted himself to the completion
		of her unpublished works.</P>
		<P>Malkiel&#146;s publications include works on historical linguistics,
		the history of linguistics, etymology, linguistic typology and
		Romance linguistics. He published in English, German, Italian,
		French, Portuguese and Spanish, and lectured as well in Russian.
		In 1946, he founded the international journal &#147;Romance Philology&#148;
		and was for many years its editor-in-chief.</P>
		<P>Malkiel&#146;s honorary degree from Salamanca, Spain, made him the
		first Jew to be honored there since the expulsion of the Jews
		from Spain in 1492.</P>
		<P>Malkiel is buried beside his wife and parents. Condolences may
		be sent to Isabel Lida Nirenberg, #6 Oak Drive, Albany, NY 12203.</P>
		<P><B>David Straube</B></P>
		<P><B>David Straube</B>, lab manager for Environmental Engineering and Health Sciences
		Laboratory operations at the Richmond Field Station, died Sunday,
		May 3.</P>
		<P>Straube started working for the School of Public Health in 1966,
		at 19. Except for the two years he served in Vietnam, he spent
		his entire career with the university. In 1981 he transferred
		to the Sanitary Engineering Research Laboratory, and became lab
		manager of EEHSL in 1992.</P>
		<P>Straube helped establish most of the laboratory&#146;s safety management
		programs, created a chemical inventory database to improve chemical
		waste management, and developed the standard operating procedure
		manual that the lab uses today. He was responsible for day-to-day
		operations at the field station and trained new personnel in safety
		matters. Under his management, the field station has operated
		without a major accident.</P>
		<P>Straube was born in Dobbs Ferry, NY, graduated from De Anza High
		School in Richmond, Calif., and lived in the Bay Area most of
		his life.</P>
		<P>For information on making a memorial donation, call EEHSL at 642-8324.</P>
		<P><B>Garff Wilson</B></P>
		<P><B>Garff Wilson</B>, the self-described &#147;unidentified man on the right&#148; who welcomed
		kings, presidents and other world figures to Berkeley, died May
		6 in Berkeley. He was 89.</P>
		<P>Over the course of 33 years, Wilson was professor of rhetoric
		and dramatic art and head of public ceremonies. He retired in
		1976.</P>
		<P>A native of Ogden, Utah, Wilson graduated from Berkeley in 1931,
		earned his PhD at Cornell, and returned to Berkeley in 1941 to
		teach before joining the army. </P>
		<P>Early in his Berkeley career, Wilson designed a campus visit for
		poet Robert Frost, followed over the years by visits from two
		U.S. presidents, seven kings, six prime ministers and countless
		other newsmakers.</P>
		<P>&#147;I was like a stagehand,&#148; he said, &#147;opening doors, moving people
		around, handing out medals. I was always there, the invisible
		man hovering nervously in the background.&#148;</P>
		<P>Other notables whose visits to campus Wilson planned and directed
		included President Harry S. Truman, Gen. George C. Mar-shall,
		Adlai Stevenson, Jacques-Ives Cousteau, Alex Haley, Barbara Tuchman,
		Dylan Thomas, the kings of Denmark, Greece and Morocco, and the
		queen of Holland.</P>
		<P>Wilson published two popular memoirs: &#147;The Unidentified Man on
		the Right: The Story of Fabulous People and Events on the Berkeley
		Campus of the University of California During the Past Four Decades&#148;
		and &#147;Color Them Blue and Gold: Memories of Students, Athletes,
		Housemates, and Rascals I Have Known at Cal.&#148; </P>
		<P>Wilson&#146;s dramatic flair came naturally as a scholar of drama,
		director of plays, and actor in summer stock theater. Wilson&#146;s
		house, along with all his mementos and honors, was destroyed in
		the 1991 East Bay hills fire. He was an ardent backer of the UC
		swim team and the Cal Marching Band, whose new uniforms are a
		recent gift from him. Wilson is survived by his sister, Janice
		Hamilton, of Los Angeles.<BR>
