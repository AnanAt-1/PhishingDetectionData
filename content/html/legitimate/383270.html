						<H2><STRONG> Albert C. Martin (1879-1960)</STRONG></H2> 
						<P>Albert C. Martin, older brother of Los Angeles architect
						  <A HREF="egmartin.htm">Emmett G. Martin</A>, completed his formal education in
						  architecture and engineering at the University of Illinois in 1902. After
						  receiving his Bachelor of Science degree, he began his apprenticeship as a
						  draftsman for Brown-Ketcham Iron Works in Indianapolis. He continued his
						  training in steel and iron technology as an inspector with the Pennsylvania
						  Railroad Company in Pittsburgh. After obtaining expert structural experience
						  working in the mills, Martin joined Cambria Steel Company in Johnstown,
						  Pennsylvania, as a designer/estimator. </P> 
						<P>In January of 1904, Martin moved to Los Angeles to accept
						  a position as a superintendent of construction for Carl Leonardt &amp; Company,
						  a major building contractor on the West Coast. A year later he joined the staff
						  of Alfred Rosenheim FAIA (1859-1943). During Martin's association with
						  Rosenheim, for whom he worked as an engineer, the firm designed the Second
						  Church of Christ Scientist (1905-1910). In 1908, Martin established his own
						  office in Los Angeles. </P>

						  BORDER="0">Among Martin's significant commissions were the Ventura County
						  Courthouse in Ventura (1911-1912), the Chapel of Mary Magdalen in Camarillo
						  (1913), St. Alphonsus Catholic Church in Fresno (1914, see photo on right), the
						  Million Dollar Theater in Los Angeles with William L. Woolett (1918), the New
						  Calvary Cemetery entrance gates in Boyle Heights (1923), St. Vincent de Paul
						  Catholic Church in Los Angeles (1923-1925), St. Monica's Catholic Church in
						  Santa Monica (1925), the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles (1925), the Los
						  Angeles City Hall, with John C. Austin, John Parkinson and Austin Whittlesey
						  (1926-1928), and the May Company in Los Angeles with S. A. Marx (1940). </P> 
						<P>Albert C. Martin died in Los Angeles on April 9, 1960. The
						  firm bearing his name, <A HREF="http://www.acmartin.com">AC Martin
						  Partners</A>, continues to play an influential role in Southern California
						  architecture. As a leading proponent of the Corporate International style, the
						  firm helped create today's dramatic downtown Los Angeles skyline with such
						  high-rise works as the striking twin towers of the Atlantic Richfield/Arco
						  Plaza (1972), the Union Bank Building (1968), the Security Pacific Plaza
						  (1973-1974), the Wells Fargo Building (1979), and the Manulife Plaza
						  (1981-1982). </P>
