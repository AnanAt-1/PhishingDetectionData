PREFATORY  NOTE 

THE  sketch  of  Professor  MacGillivray's  life  and  work 
which  follows  was  at  first  written  in  the  form,  and  with 
the  brevity,  of  an  article  intended  for  a  newspaper  in 
connection  with  the  movement,  then  begun,  for  the 
promotion  of  a  Memorial  of  him ;  but  it  was  not  so 
used,  and  was  retained,  altered,  and  added  to  from 
time  to  time,  the  result  partly  of  suggestions  from 
friends,  most  of  them  former  pupils  of  the  Professor, 
and  partly  of  information  which  came  to  me  from 
different  sources  at  odd  times.  It  is  in  no  sense 
a  "  Life  "  of  my  eminent  namesake — for  such  a  work  I 
am  not  competent — but  merely  an  appreciative  sketch 
in  which  I  have  tried  to  record,  and  to  some  extent 
illustrate,  my  own  conception  of  his  special  pre-emi- 
nence as  an  ornithologist,  and  my  warm  admiration  of 
his  high  qualities  of  mind  and  character,  as  these  come 
out  so  prominently  in  connection  with  his  life's  work 
in  the  different  spheres  in  which  his  lot  had  been 
successively  cast.

SKETCH   OF   PROF.   MACGILLIVRAY'S 
LIFE   AND    WORK 

THE  MEMORIAL. 

IT  is  upwards  of  forty-eight  years  since  William 
MacGillivray,  M.A.,  LL.D.,  Professor  of  Natural 
History  and  Lecturer  on  Botany  in  Marischal  College 
and  University,  Aberdeen,  son  of  William  MacGillivray, 
a  surgeon  in  the  Army,  died  in  his  fifty-sixth  year — 
having  been  born  in  Old  Aberdeen  in  1796.  He  was 
buried  in  the  New  Calton  Bury  ing -Ground,  Edinburgh, 
where  his  wife  and  two  children,  who  predeceased  him, 
had  previously  been  interred.  Until  nearly  the  close 
of  last  year  there  was  not  even  a  tombstone  to  show 
where  the  author  of  a  History  of  British  Birds  and  The 
Natural  History  of  Deeside  and  Braemar  lies,  an  over- 
sight resulting  no  doubt  from  the  circumstance  of  all  the 
members  of  his  family  having,  either  before  his  death  or 
soon  after,  gone  for  permanent  residence  abroad. 

Nearly  three  years  ago  the  attention  of  some  of 
Professor  MacGillivray' s  former  students — all  now  well 
advanced  in  life — was  called  to  the  oversight  which 

B

ill  became  the  memory  of  so  eminent  a  naturalist  and 
so  estimable  a  man.  A  meeting  of  several  gentlemen 
who  specially  cherished  his  memory  was  held  in  Edin- 
burgh on  27th  May  1898  ;  and,  with  a  view  to  promot- 
ing a  suitable  memorial  of  him,  a  committee  was  then 
appointed  with  full  powers  to  follow  out  the  object 
of  the  meeting  and  to  devise  and  carry  into  effect 
such  a  scheme  for  a  memorial  as  they  might  find  to 
be  practicable  and  most  fitted  for  its  purpose,  with 
power  to  add  to  their  number.  The  following  gentle- 
men ultimately  formed  the  committee  : — 

The  Rev.  William  Mair,  D.D.,  Earlston. 

The  Rev.  Patrick  Beaton,  Paris,  son-in-law  of  Professor 
MacGillivray. 

J.  A.  Harvie  Brown,  Esq.,  of  Dunipace. 

Professor  J.  Cossar  Ewart,  M.D.,  F.R.S.,  Edinburgh. 

The  Rev.  James  Farquharson,  D.D.,  47  Mardale  Crescent, 
Edinburgh  (senior  minister  of  Selkirk). 

Alexander  Fraser,  Esq.,  Wimmera,  Bruntsfield  Place, 
Edinburgh. 

Principal  Sir  W.  D.  Geddes,  LL.D.,  Aberdeen  (now  dead). 

Professor  E.  Ray  Lankester,  LL.D.,  F.R.S.,  Director  of  the 
Museum  of  Natural  History,  Kensington. 

William  MacGillivray,  Esq.,  W.S.,  Edinburgh. 

The  Rev.  Alexander  Mitchell,  D.D.,  Dunfermline. 

The  Rev.  James  Mitchell,  D.D.,  South  Leith. 

Emeritus -Professor  Sir  John  Struthers,  LL.D.,  Edinburgh 
(now  dead). 

Professor  J.  W.  H.  Trail,  F.R.S.,  Aberdeen. 

John  Forbes  White,  Esq.,  LL.D.,  Dundee. 

Dr.    Mair   was   appointed   chairman  of    the   com- 


SKETCH  OF  LIFE   AND   WORK  3 

mittee,  and  Dr.  Farquharson  secretary  and  treasurer. 
Subscriptions  were  readily  obtained  from  relations  of 
Professor  MacGillivray,  all  now  abroad,  from  former 
students  in  his  classes  and  from  others ;  and  the  object 
for  which  the  committee  was  appointed  has  now  been 
attained.1 

The  memorial  is  of  a  double  character.  A 
monument  has  been  erected  at  MacGillivray's  grave 
and  a  mural  memorial  tablet  has  been  placed  in 
Marischal  College,  Aberdeen. 

The  monument  consists  of  a  large  slab  of  Peter- 
head  red  granite  with  an  lona  cross  in  a  setting  of 
Celtic  scroll  work  cut  in  the  upper  part  of  its  face, 
while  a  bronze  relief  of  an  eagle  has  been  inserted  in 
the  centre  compartment  of  a  Celtic  arcade  ornament 
on  its  lower  part.  The  middle  of  the  stone,  which, 
with  the  cross,  alone  is  polished,  contains  the  following 
inscription  : — "  In  memory  of  William  MacGillivray, 
M.A.,  LL.D.,  born  1796,  died  1852,  author  of  a 
History  of  British  Birds  and  other  standard  works 
in  Natural  Science ;  Professor  of  Natural  History  and 
Lecturer  on  Botany  in  Marischal  College  and  Uni- 
versity from  1841  to  1852.  Erected  in  1900,  together 
with  a  memorial  brass  in  Marischal  College,  Aberdeen, 
by  his  relatives  and  surviving  students,  who  affection- 
ately cherish  his  memory,  and  by  others  desirous  of 
doing  honour  to  his  character  as  a  man  and  to  his 
eminence  as  a  naturalist."  The  entire  memorial — both 
stone  and  bronze — is  a  piece  of  fine  artistic  work,  and

is  in  perfection  of  good  taste.  Nothing  could  be 
more  appropriate  as  a  memorial  of  the  West  Highland 
ornithologist.  The  monument  was  designed  and 
executed  by  Messrs.  S.  M'Glashen  and  Son,  Edin- 
burgh, while  the  eagle  was  modelled  and  cast  by  Mr. 
D.  W.  Stevenson,  R.S.A.,  from  MacGillivray's  own 
very  fine  life-like  drawing  of  the  golden  eagle  now 
in  the  Natural  History  Museum,  Kensington.  The 
vitality  and  power  of  expression  in  the  drawing  have 
been  rendered  with  success  in  the  metal.  The  eagle 
forming  the  frontispiece  to  this  volume  is  a  zinco- 
colotype  from  a  photograph  of  it. 

The  tablet  for  Marischal  College  was  designed  by 
Mr.  C.  R.  Ashbee,  architect,  37  Cheyne  Walk, 
Chelsea,  and  was  executed  by  the  Guild  of  Handicraft, 
Limited,  16  Brook  Street,  London. 

It  is  a  beautiful  work  of  art,  and  is  specially  suitable 
for  its  position  in  Marischal  College  as  a  memorial  of 
the  famous  ornithologist  and  Professor  of  Natural 
History  in  that  college.  The  inscription,  in  the  same 
terms  as  that  on  the  monument,  and  in  an  antique, 
picturesque  and  tasteful  style  of  lettering,  occupies 
the  centre  of  the  plate,  while  the  borders  are  filled 
with  natural  history  and  botanical  objects  —  all  in 
conformity  with  nature — the  birds  especially  being 
instinct  with  life,  each  exhibiting  attitude  and  action 
characteristic  of  its  species.  The  borders  are  in  open 
work  of  beaten  copper,  partly  bronzed  and  partly 
gilded,  shown  effectively  against  a  background  of  pale 
red,  while  the  whole  of  the  remaining  parts  of  the

sides  and  the  cornice,  are  of  oak.  Every  detail  of  the 
work  is  beautifully  finished ;  and  it  is  difficult  to 
conceive  a  finer  specimen  of  art  of  the  kind,  whether 
in  design  or  in  execution. 

An  extremely  interesting  ceremonial  took  place  in 
Marischal  College  on  20th  November  last,  when  the 
tablet  was  formally  unveiled  and  presented  to  the 
University  by  Dr.  John  Forbes  White  on  behalf  of 
the  committee  and  subscribers.  The  University  was 
represented  by  Principal  Marshall  Lang  and  several 
of  the  professors,  while  others  interested  in  perpetuat- 
ing the  memory  of  Professor  MacGillivray,  including 
a  number  of  ladies,  formed  part  of  the  company 
present. 

A  report  of  the  proceedings  from  the  Aberdeen 
Free  Press  forms  a  subsequent  part  of  this  memorial 
volume.  Dr.  White  having  been  a  distinguished 
student  of  Professor  MacGillivray,  and  having  in  his 
Aberdeen  University  days  been  in  intimate  sympathetic 
relations  with  him,  there  was  no  one  better  fitted  to 
discharge  the  duty  which  was  put  upon  him,  and  none 
could  have  done  it  better.  His  address  is  everything 
that  could  have  been  desired  for  the  occasion  and  is 
well  worthy  of  being  preserved  in  a  permanent  form. 

As  time  goes  on  the  real  value  of  Professor 
MacGillivray's  work,  and  especially  of  his  History 
of  British  Birds,  continues  to  grow  in  the  estima- 
tion of  scientists ;  while  that  delightful  book  has 
never  ceased  to  be  attractive  to  the  general  reader

who  is  a  lover  of  birds  and  a  sympathetic  observer  of 
bird  life. 

There  has  not  yet  been  written  any  adequate 
account  of  MacGillivray's  life  and  work;  and,  un- 
fortunately, the  means  of  now  writing  such  scarcely 
exist.  It  is  known  that  from  an  early  period  he  kept 
full  and  careful  journals,  by  the  aid  of  which  a 
biography  of  great  interest  could  have  been  prepared, 
but  these  were  destroyed  years  ago,  and  their  place, 
it  is  feared,  cannot  now  be  supplied  from  any  other 
source.  The  following  short  sketch  of  his  life  and 
work  has  been  prepared  from  such  means  as  have  been 
found  to  be  yet  readily  available. 

His  life  history  of  fifty-six  years  may  be  divided  into 
five  successive  periods,  each  of  which  has  its  peculiar 
interest — especially  when  regarded  with  reference  to 
the  outcome  of  his  many  undertakings. 


1. — His  CHILDHOOD  IN  HARRIS. 

The  first  period  extends  from  the  time  when  he 
left  Aberdeen,  three  years  old,  for  Harris,  where  his 
childhood  was  spent  with  two  uncles,  tenants  of  the 
farm  of  Northtown  there,  brothers  of  his  father,  who 
was  then  with  his  regiment,  the  Cameron  Highlanders. 
He  remained  there  attending  the  parish  school  at  Obbe 
until  he  was  eleven  years  of  age,  when  he  returned 
to  Aberdeen  for  the  advantages  of  further  education, 
which  was  not  obtainable  in  Harris.  During  these 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND    WORK          7 

eight  years  in  Harris  he  must  have  learned  much 
which  favoured  the  native  bent  of  his  mind  towards 
the  study  of  nature.  The  sea,  the  rocks,  and  the 
mountains  in  their  ever -varying  aspects,  in  summer 
and  in  winter,  in  sunshine  and  in  storm,  with  their 
wild  fowl  in  vast  numbers,  species  succeeding  species 
in  constant  movement  in  their  respective  seasons 
according  to  their  habits  and  the  necessities  of  their 
nature,  were  all  fitted  to  minister  to  the  growth  of 
a  mind  which  was  naturally  contemplative,  and  at  the 
same  time  extremely  observant,  sympathetic  with  every 
form  of  life,  and  readily  responsive  to  the  grandeur  and 
the  beauties  of  Hebridean  scenery. 

There  is  no  written  existing  record  as  to  how  he 
passed  those  years,  but  that  "the  foundations  of  his 
mind  "  had  then  been  laid,  with  promise  of  subsequent 
growth  in  the  direction  of  its  ultimate  development, 
there  can  be  no  doubt.  In  a  poem  by  him,  more 
particularly  referred  to  in  a  subsequent  part  of  this 
sketch,  he  says : 

"  The  solitudes  of  nature  were  my  school, 

And  in  the  moaning  voice  of  streams  and  winds, 
Without  the  aid  of  dull  scholastic  rule, 

I  felt  the  tone  which  in  the  lone  heart  finds 
Its  echo." 


2. — UNIVERSITY  PERIOD  IN  ABERDEEN. 

The  second  period   extends  from  the  time  of  his 
return  to  Aberdeen,  first  for  further  school  education 


8  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

and  afterwards  for  his  university  course  of  study  at 
King's  College,  which  he  entered  when  twelve  years 
old,  just  one  year  before  the  death  of  his  father,  who 
was  killed  in  the  battle  of  Coruna  in  February  1809. 
After  finishing  his  arts  curriculum  and  taking  his  M.A. 
degree  there,  he  entered  on  the  study  of  medicine. 
While  pursuing  his  medical  learning  he  began,  in  1817, 
the  study  of  zoology,  his  only  guides,  as  he  said,  being 
Linnaeus  and  Pennant,  while  he  knew  no  one  who  had 
any  knowledge  of  the  subject  except  a  friend  and 
fellow-student,  William  Craigie.1 

During  this  period  of  study  at  Aberdeen  he  was  in 
the  habit  of  spending  his  long  summer  holidays  with 
his  relations  in  Harris.  His  journeys  to  and  fro,  in  so 
far  as  on  the  mainland,  were  always  performed  on  foot ; 
and  in  his  book  on  British  birds  he  gives  a  very  inter- 
esting and  picturesque  account  of  a  walk  on  one  occa- 
sion during  the  night  from  Blair  Atholl  on  his  way 
back  from  the  West  to  the  Wells  of  Dee,  where  he 
had  arranged  to  meet  William  Craigie  on  the  morning 
of  the  following  day.  Another  very  interesting  excur- 
sion to  the  sources  of  the  Dee,  while  on  his  way  to  the 
West  in  1819,  is  narrated  in  his  Natural  History  of 
Deeside. 

During  his  holidays  in  Harris  he  devoted  much  of 
his  time  to  teaching  in  the  school  at  Obbe  ;  and  a  local 
tradition  of  him  still  is  that  he  was  a  most  attractive 
teacher,  often  directing  the  minds  of  his  pupils  to  those 

1  William  Craigie  afterwards  emigrated  to  Canada  and  settled  in 
the  town  of  Hamilton,  Ontario. 


aspects  of  nature,  both  animate  and  inanimate,  in  which 
he  was  himself  specially  interested,  dwelling  much  on 
the  evidence  of  creative  power  and  design,  which  he 
found  everywhere  in  nature.  He  also  spent  much  time 
in  watching  by  night  as  well  as  by  day  the  lives  and 
habits  of  birds,  often  concealing  himself  for  many  hours 
continuously,  now  in  some  cave  or  rocky  recess  from 
which  the  endless  varieties  of  swimming  birds  could  be 
most  readily  seen,  and  again  in  some  temporary  shelter 
erected  by  himself  on  the  higher  cliffs,  from  which  the 
eagle,  the  osprey,  the  raven,  and  others  could  be  closely 
observed. 

He  made  many  excursions,  whenever  opportunity 
occurred,  with  his  congenial  friend,  William  Craigie, 
"  zealously  striving,"  as  he  says  in  the  preface  to  his 
Rapacious  Birds  of  Great  Britain,  "to  add  to  our 
common  store  of  knowledge  both  in  zoology  and 
botany.  Many  pleasant  and  successful  excursions  we 
made  together  in  quest  of  plants  and  animals  on  the 
romantic  braes  of  the  Don,  the  pebbly  shores  of  the 
Dee,  the  rocks  of  the  Cove,  the  sands  of  the  seashore 
and  the  bleak  moors  of  the  interior." 

The  fascination  of  their  pursuits,  he  tells  us,  was 
such  that  after  studying  medicine  for  nearly  five  years 
— officiating  part  of  the  time  as  dissector  to  the 
lecturer  on  anatomy  at  Marischal  College — he  resolved 
to  relinquish  it,  and  to  devote  himself  exclusively  to 
natural  history.  Under  many  difficulties  he  persevered, 
wandering  far  and  wide  over  most  parts  of  Scotland, 
and  exploring  "  the  desolate  isles  of  the  West,"  as  he 


10  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

very  appropriately  calls  the  Outer  Hebrides.  On  one 
occasion  he  tells  us  he  walked  from  Aberdeen  to 
London  with  his  journal  and  Smith's  Flora  Britannica 
on  his  back,  for  the  purpose  of  seeing  the  country  and 
visiting  the  British  Museum. 

MacGillivray's  study  of  medicine  was  begun  in 
1814-15,  as  pupil  to  George  Barclay,  M.D.,  physician 
to  the  Aberdeen  Infirmary  and  Lecturer  on  Surgery  in 
King's  and  Marischal  Colleges.  Dr.  Barclay  was  him- 
self then  quite  a  young  man — only  about  three  years 
older  than  MacGillivray  his  pupil.  He  was  a  native  of 
Aberdeenshire — youngest  son  of  Charles  Barclay,  Esq., 
of  Templeland,  in  the  parish  of  Auchterless.  He  was 
much  respected  and  trusted  as  a  physician,  and  beloved 
by  all  who  had  relationships  with  him,  whether  profes- 
sionally or  as  friends.  MacGillivray's  attachment  to 
him  was  deep  and  sincere ;  and  on  his  death,  of  typhus 
fever,  on  20th  December  1819,  in  the  twenty-seventh 
year  of  his  age,  MacGillivray,  then  resident  in  Edin- 
burgh, wrote  and  printed  "  A  Tribute  to  the  Memory 
of  a  Friend  ;  being  a  Poem  on  the  Death  of  George 
Barclay,  M.D.,"  to  which  was  prefixed  a  short  account 
of  Dr.  Barclay's  life  and  character.  In  the  poem  he 
warmly  expresses  his  feelings  of  attachment  towards 
his  deceased  teacher  and  friend,  and  his  warm  sense  of 
indebtedness  to  him.  He  had  sent  the  poem  to  Mrs. 
Barclay  in  manuscript,  accompanying  it  with  a  letter 
dated  4th  March  1820,  in  which  he  writes :  "  The 
poem  which  accompanies  this,  such  as  it  is,  is  the  pure 
offering  of  feeling,  and  such  as  its  title  indicates.  I 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND  WORK         11 

could  from  my  soul  wish  it  better,  not  from  selfish 
motives.  I  shall  be  happy  if  Mrs.  Barclay  think  of  it 
as  her  friends  here  do.  But  in  subjecting  it  to  her 
examination  I  expect  the  most  unrestrained  criticism. 
...  I  must  not  indulge  in  reflections — even  though  I 
should  be  deemed  callous.  My  poem  will  speak  my 
feelings." 

The  poem  is  in  the  Spenserian  stanza,  the  same  as 
that  which  had  been  adopted  by  Dr.  Beattie  in  his 
"  Minstrel."  Beattie  ("  Bard  of  the  North,"  as  he  had 
been  designated)  was  then  a  strong  poetic  influence  in 
the  counties  of  Aberdeen  and  Kincardine.  He  was 
a  native  of  Laurencekirk  in  Kincardineshire,  became 
parish  schoolmaster  of  Fordoun  in  the  same  county, 
and  was  afterwards,  from  1769  to  a  few  years  before  his 
death  in  1803,  Professor  of  Moral  Philosophy  and  Logic 
in  Marischal  College  and  University,  Aberdeen.  The 
easy,  smooth,  flowing  rhythm  of  his  verse  was  very 
attractive  to  the  ear,  while  the  thought  and  sentiment 
of  his  poems  were  not  unfrequently  worthy  of  a  more 
free  and  less  formal  poetic  diction.  Several  of  his  best 
known  poems  were  included  in  the  Scotch  school  books 
which  were  most  in  use  in  MacGillivray's  early  days. 
One  of  these  (Masons  Collection}  was  popular  in  the  two 
counties  even  within  the  memory  of  the  writer  of  this  ; 
and  the  most  familiarly  known  and  best  loved  poem  in 
it  was  undoubtedly  "  Beattie's  Hermit." 

MacGillivray,  in  his  sketch  of  the  life  of  Dr.  Barclay, 
says :  "  Beattie  was  among  his  favourite  authors  par- 
ticularly in  poetry."  The  local  predominance  of 


12  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

Seattle's  influence,  and  MacGillivray's  affectionate 
regard  for  his  teacher  and  friendly  guide,  no  doubt 
mainly  account  for  the  peculiar  diction  and  style  of  his 
tributory  poem.  It  is  Beattie's  "  Minstrel "  all  through 
— quite  the  style  of  the  early  years  of  the  latter  half  of 
the  eighteenth  century,  in  which  human  virtues  and 
vices,  with  capital  initial  letters,  were  personified,  while 
certain  stereotyped  euphonious  words  and  phrases  were 
constantly  repeated  whatever  the  subject  of  the  poem 
might  be, — all  associated  with  strictest  propriety  of 
conduct,  formal  respectability  in  morals  and  religion, 
lone  Philomelas  in  shady  groves,  powdered  wigs,  silver 
buckled  shoes,  etc.  etc.  Still,  in  MacGillivray's  poem 
there  is,  notwithstanding  the  antiquated  diction,  which 
had  been  quite  abandoned  by  our  best  poets  early 
in  the  nineteenth  century,  much  real  poetic  feeling 
with  absolute  sincerity  of  purpose.  Fine  reflective 
thought  also  now  and  again  breaks  through  the  ancient 
mode  of  expression.  This  is  well  illustrated  in  several 
of  those  stanzas  in  which  MacGillivray  portrays  the 
character  of  his  deceased  friend,  and  gives  free  expres- 
sion to  his  feelings  towards  him.  As  the  poem  extends 
to  forty  pages  it  is  too  long  for  being  wholly  included 
in  this  volume,  but  several  of  the  more  interesting 
stanzas  are  quoted  from  it  as  affording  fair  specimens  of 
its  general  character,  and  as  throwing  light  on  some 
interesting  features  of  the  growing  mind  of  the  youthful 
writer — then  only  twenty-four  years  of  age.  One 
cannot  help  regretting,  in  reading  these  stanzas,  that  a 
young  man  of  his  early  poetic  promise  should  not  have 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         13 

come  within  the  influence  of  the  unconventional  style 
and  imaginative  power  of  Wordsworth,  which  enabled 
him  to  realise  and  to  interpret  to  others  the  spiritual  in 
nature  as  no  one  else  had  done.  How  much  it  might 
have  added  to  MacGillivray's  appreciation  of  those 
aspects  of  nature  which  interested  him  most,  while  it 
would  have  led  him  to  a  deeper  sense  of  the  divine  in 
nature — true  and  deep  as  that  sense  in  him  always  was. 
It  would  probably  also  have  tended  towards  greater  free- 
dom from  conventionalities,  which  must  have  hampered 
him  more  or  less  (unconsciously)  in  his  search  after 
truth,  even  in  his  own  departments  of  science.  But 
the  early  acquired  predilection  for  the  Beattie  style  of 
poetry,  with  the  severity  of  the  Edinburgh  Review 
criticisms  of  the  "  Lake  School "  and  of  Wordsworth's 
poetry  in  particular,  which  then  prejudiced  so  many 
minds  against  it,  sufficiently  accounts  for  the  absence 
of  the  Wordsworth  influence  on  his  mind — intensely 
devoted  to  nature  as  he  was. 

In  one  of  the  extracts  from  the  memorial  poem 
given  further  on  in  this  volume  the  writer  of  it,  re- 
ferring to  Dr.  Barclay's  influence  on  him,  says — 

"  The  name  which  hallows  this  rude  sonsr 

o 

Has  been  to  me  a  blessing  and  a  light 
To  guide  me  on  my  weary  way  along," 

and  again — 

"  He  saw  my  follies,  and  reprov'd  them  oft : 
Not  in  the  galling  tone  of  sullen  speech, 
But  as  a  friend,  in  accents  firm  though  soft," 


14  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

while  in  another  passage  he  says — 

"  Friend  to  the  friendless,  he  was  all  to  me 
That  my  fond  heart  could  wish." 

Indeed,  again  and  again  throughout  the  poem  his 
love  and  respect  for  Dr.  Barclay  is  expressed  with 
evidently  unfeigned  sincerity,  although  at  times  in 
language  which  may  to  the  reader  appear  bordering  on 
exaggeration — not  unnatural  in  a  youthful  mind  so 
deeply  affected,  but  which  to  him  was  no  exaggeration. 

The  midnight  scene  in  the  Hebrides — the  subject 
of  the  last  of  the  poetic  extracts  given  in  this  volume- 
is  specially  fine,  although  quite  in  the  Beattie  spirit  and 
style — especially  the  last  line,  which  suggests  the  effect 
of  it  as  wooing  "  the  contemplative  mind  to  midnight's 
bower." 

The  poem  is  highly  valued,  and  is  carefully  pre- 
served, by  Dr.  Barclay's  still  surviving  son,  Mr.  George 
Barclay,  of  17  Coates  Crescent,  Edinburgh. 

Mr.  Barclay  has  a  distinct  recollection  of  his  mother 
telling  him  of  the  first  impression  made  on  her  by  her 
husband's  "wild  Highland  pupil,"  when  as  a  young 
wife  she  went  to  Aberdeen  in  October  1816.  No  doubt 
MacGillivray  had  just  then  returned  from  his  annual 
summer  stay  in  Harris — his  clothing  and  his  person 
probably  still  betraying  more  or  less  the  effects  of  his 
long  pedestrian  journey,  in  which  there  had  been  much 
scrambling  over  rocks,  wading  through  marshes,  and 
wandering  among  peat  bogs  in  search  of  rare  plants,  or 
for  observation  of  the  habits  of  birds,  which  had 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         15 

attracted  his  attention  by  the  way.  He  not  unnatur- 
ally, therefore,  presented  to  Mrs.  Barclay  more  the 
appearance  of  a  somewhat  primitive  Hebridean  Celt 
than  of  the  Aberdeen  medical  student ;  but  the  qualities 
of  head  and  heart  soon  made  him  a  welcome  guest  and 
friend. 


3. — EDINBURGH  PERIOD  TO  1831. 

The  third  period  embraces  the  eleven  or  twelve 
years  of  his  earlier  residence  in  Edinburgh.  He  first 
went  there,  he  says  in  the  preface  to  his  Rapacious 
Birds  of  Great  Britain,  on  the  advice  of  a  friend,  to 
engage  in  "  a  kind  of  mineralogical  speculation."  The 
friend  was  probably  Dr.  Barclay,  whose  father-in-law, 
Mr.  Walter  Berry  of  Edinburgh,  was  much  interested 
in  mineralogy.  MacGillivray  does  not  say  what  the 
nature  of  the  speculation  was,  or  how  it  resulted ; 
but  he  adds  that  he  then  attended  the  lectures  of 
Professor  Jamieson,  who  at  that  time  occupied  the 
Chair  of  Natural  History  in  the  University.  He  again 
returned  to  the  Hebrides,  where  he  occupied  his  time 
in  "hammering  gneiss  rocks,  gathering  gulls'  eggs,  and 
shooting  birds";  but  he  got  tired  of  that  occupation, 
which,  although  congenial  to  him,  and  was  daily  add- 
ing to  his  knowledge  of  nature,  afforded  no  means  of 
present  livelihood  or  prospect  of  it  for  the  future. 
Besides  having,  on  29th  September  1820,  married  Miss 
Marion  MacCaskill  of  Harris  (he  being  then  twenty- 


16  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

four  years  of  age  and  she  seventeen),  the  necessity  for 
some  settled  income  must  have  become  urgent.  He 
therefore  returned  to  Edinburgh,  where  he  obtained  the 
position  of  assistant  and  secretary  to  Professor  Jamieson, 
under  whom  he  undertook  the  charge  of  the  Natural 
History  Museum  there.  Here  he  found  abundant 
opportunity  for  continuing  his  study  of  natural  history, 
and  especially  his  favourite  branch  of  it,  ornithology, 
with  the  aid  of  the  collection  of  specimens  in  the 
Museum,  and  subjects  which  came  into  his  hands  for 
dissection,  or  which  he  himself  collected  in  the  course 
of  his  excursions  around  Edinburgh  and  elsewhere. 

He  occupied  this  position  for  several  years,  but 
desiring  to  have  more  leisure,  as  he  explains  in  the 
preface  to  his  book  on  Rapacious  Birds,  for  prosecut- 
ing his  investigations  in  the  field,  he  resigned  it,  and 
resumed  his  wanderings,  extending  these  more  widely 
than  before,  mainly  for  the  purpose  of  enlarging  his 
knowledge  of  the  habits  and  lives  of  his  feathered 
favourites — supporting  himself  and  his  family,  as  he 
says,  by  his  "  labours  in  the  closet."  What  those  closet 
labours  consisted  of  we  have  no  precise  information, 
but  they  were  no  doubt  principally  of  the  nature  of 
contributions  connected  with  natural  history  to  scientific 
periodicals,  compilations,  and  other  miscellaneous  liter- 
ary work.

4. — CONSERVATOR  OF  THE  MUSEUM  OF  THE  EDINBURGH 
COLLEGE  OF  SURGEONS,  1831  TO  1841 — "  HISTORY 
OF  BRITISH  BIRDS  " — AUDUBON. 

In  1831  he  was  unanimously  chosen,  without  any 
influence  being  sought  or  used  on  his  behalf,  from 
amongst  ten  applicants  for  the  position  of  Conservator 
of  the  Museum  of  the  Edinburgh  College  of  Surgeons, 
as  successor  to  Dr.  Knox ;  and  thus  began  the  fourth 
period  of  his  life,  which  extended  to  1841.  The  amount 
of  work  done  by  him  during  that  period  was  marvel- 
lous, while  on  the  results  of  it,  and  of  the  many  years' 
previous  preparation,  his  fame  as  an  ornithologist 
mainly  rests. 

During  the  ten  years  he  occupied  that  position,  his 
duties  to  -the  Museum  were  discharged  with  the  most 
conscientious  care  and  with  perfect  scientific  skill  and 
intelligence.  His  first  year's  work  was  especially 
arduous  and  laborious,  and  it  severely  tested  both  his 
physical  and  his  mental  powers.  When  he  entered  on 
his  duties  on  17th  September  1831,  the  numerous  pre- 
parations belonging  to  the  College  were  partly  in  the 
old  museum  in  Surgeon  Square  and  partly  in  two 
other  separate  buildings  ;  while  their  condition  and 
arrangement  were  far  from  satisfactory.  The  existing 
handsome  building  was  just  then  being  completed  from 
designs  by  Mr.  Playfair,  and  it  fell  to  MacGillivray  to 
see  the  contents  of  the  old  buildings  removed  to  the 
new  one.  He  found  the  preparations  in  a  very  un- 

c 


18  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

satisfactory  condition — many  of  them  badly  prepared, 
badly  put  up,  and  badly  arranged,  while  almost  all  were 
far  from  clean.  He  had  them  thoroughly  cleaned 
and  otherwise  put  into  a  satisfactory  condition,  and 
re -arranged  the  whole  collection,  re -labelling  every 
article.  The  labelling  of  4000  articles  was  of  itself  a 
most  laborious  undertaking,  occupying  many  months. 
Almost  all  the  labour,  except  the  actual  cleaning  and 
the  manual  work  of  transport  to  the  new  hall,  was 
done  by  his  own  hands.  In  one  of  his  most  interesting 
reports  to  the  Curators — interesting  as  throwing  light 
on  the  capacity  and  character  of  the  man — he  says  that 
he  must  practically  do  all  the  work  himself,  "as  no 
benefit  would  be  derived  from  the  interference  of 
others."  The  labels  in  his  own  neat  handwriting  are 
still  to  be  seen  attached  to  many  of  the  preparations 
which  remain  in  the  order  in  which  they  were  left 
by  him. 

During  the  year  1832  the  removal  and  re-arrange- 
ment were  completed ;  and  the  College,  it  is  believed, 
recognises  to  this  day  the  work  then  done  as  of 
permanent  value  to  the  Museum — the  system  of 
arrangement  adopted  by  MacGillivray  being  still 
adhered  to. 

The  work  thus  accomplished  by  MacGillivray 
was  specially  acknowledged  by  the  College  in  terms 
that  leave  no  room  for  doubt  as  to  its  efficiency  and 
value,  as  appears  from  many  of  its  minutes.  In  a 
minute,  dated  2nd  August  1832,  it  is  recorded  that 
"  Mr.  Wood  said  there  could  be  but  one  opinion  as 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        19 

to  the  general  assiduity  and  talent  which  had  been 
shown  by  the  Conservator  in  the  very  arduous  task  of 
removing  and  arranging  the  Museum,  which  he  had 
performed  so  much  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  College. 
He  therefore  begged  to  move  that  the  sum  of  £50, 
together  with  the  thanks  of  the  College,  be  presented 
to  the  Conservator  for  the  extra  labour  he  had  had  in 
the  matter." 

At  the  next  meeting  of  the  College  (13th  August 
1832),  "Dr.  Gairdner,  President,  in  absence  of  Mr. 
Wood,  proposed  that  his  motion  of  2nd  August,  re- 
garding a  grant  of  money  and  vote  of  thanks  to  the 
Conservator,  be  approved,  as  he  believed  it  was  admitted 
on  all  hands  that  Mr.  MacGillivray  was  most  deserving 
of  this  mark  of  approbation  from  the  College,  especially 
as  the  motion  proceeded  from  the  Curators  of  the 
Museum,  who  were  best  acquainted  with  the  nature  and 
extent  of  his  labours  and  with  the  manner  in  which  he 
had  performed  his  duties.  The  motion  was  unanimously 
carried." 

The  subsequent  minutes  of  the  College  afford 
abundant  evidence  of  the  extremely  satisfactory  manner 
in  which  MacGillivray  continued  to  discharge  his  duties 
as  conservator  during  the  remaining  eight  years  of  his 
tenure  of  that  office,  never  grudging  time  or  trouble 
in  the  discharge  of  these  duties  in  the  manner  most 
conducive  to  the  interests  of  the  College  and  to  the 
entire  satisfaction  of  that  body. 

His  knowledge  of  comparative  anatomy  and  of 
natural  history  the  College  recognised  as  being  of 


20  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

special  importance  in  connection  with  his  duties  in  the 
Museum;  and  by  a  minute  of  21st  March  1833  they 
authorise  him  to  absent  himself  from  the  Museum 
on  Saturdays,  "  for  the  purpose  of  enabling  him  to  go 
into  the  country  and  give  demonstrations  on  natural 
history." 

A  minute  of  2nd  August  following  bears  that  the 
Curators  in  their  quarterly  report  to  the  College 
"  desire  to  express  their  satisfaction  with  the  state  of 
the  collection  under  their  care  and  with  the  skill  and 
attention  by  which  the  duties  of  the  Conservator  have 
been  performed,  and  that  it  appeared  to  the  Curators 
that,  as  he  is  at  present  engaged  in  preparing  the  cata- 
logue, considerable  advantage  would  be  derived  from  his 
being  enabled  to  spend  three  or  four  weeks  in  London 
for  the  purpose  of  inspecting  the  museums  there.  Mr. 
Brown  moved,  agreeably  to  the  recommendation  inti- 
mated in  the  report  of  the  Curators,  that  the  Conser- 
vator be  sent  to  London  at  the  expense  of  the  College 
for  the  purpose  of  examining  the  museums  there  with 
the  view  of  preparing  himself  to  adjust  the  catalogue 
of  the  Museum  belonging  to  this  College,  which  motion 
was  agreed  to." 

The  minute  of  12th  November  contains  the  follow- 
ing passage  from  the  Curators'  report : — "  It  will  be 
recollected  that  the  College,  with  the  view  to  the 
preparation  of  the  catalogue,  gave  permission  to  the 
Conservator  to  inspect  the  museums  in  London.  He 
visited  previously  the  University  and  Andersonian 
Museums  of  Glasgow,  the  collections  of  natural 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        21 

history  in  Liverpool,  and  the  Museums  of  Dublin  and 
Bristol.  In  London  he  visited  the  various  collections, 
taking  such  notes  and  drawings  as  may  be  of  use  in 
completing  our  own  arrangements.  He  visited  also  the 
museum  at  Chatham.  The  Curators  have  every  reason 
to  be  pleased  with  the  industry  and  intelligence  displayed 
by  the  Conservator  in  the  tour  which  he  has  made." 

The  College  approved  of  the  report  and  agreed 
that  the  Conservator  should  have  the  use  of  a  clerk  to 
assist  him  in  making  out  the  catalogne. 

Fortunately  MacGillivray's  journal  of  his  tour  of 
inspection  of  the  museums  has  been  preserved,  and  it 
appears  to  be  of  so  much  interest  as  throwing  light  on 
some  of  the  more  remarkable  features  of  his  character 
that  it  is  included  in  this  volume  —  passages  which 
are  merely  technical  or  without  general  interest  being 
omitted.  Three  or  four  weeks  was  the  time  allowed  him 
by  the  College  for  the  inspection,  and  it  will  be  seen 
that  he  inspected  the  museums  in  Glasgow,  Liverpool, 
Dublin,  Bristol,  and  London — numbering  twenty-four 
in  all — and  that  he  accomplished  the  whole  of  that  work, 
including  his  various  journeys,  from  the  time  he  left 
Edinburgh  on  4th  September  until  his  return  on  29th 
of  that  month  (three  weeks  and  four  days),  although 
there  was  then  no  railway  to  quicken  his  transit  except 
on  a  visit  from  Liverpool  to  Manchester  and  back  ;  and 
it  appears  from  the  journal  that  he  had  gained  all  the 
information  with  regard  to  the  different  museums,  the 
acquisition  of  which  was  the  special  object  of  his  tour. 
The  contents  of  the  museums,  the  arrangement  of  the 


22  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

preparations,  the  mode  in  which  they  had  been  pre- 
served, labelled,  etc.,  and  their  condition  generally, 
were  readily  taken  in  by  him  in  all  their  detail,  as  well 
as  in  their  general  features,  and  were  noted  for  refer- 
ence in  connection  with  his  own  work.  He  learned 
much  that  was  of  special  interest  to  him,  although 
apparently  very  little  that  was  suggestive  of  improve- 
ment on  his  own  ideas  of  museum  classification  and 
arrangement.  Indeed  he  comments  very  unfavourably 
on  the  condition  of  some  of  the  museums  he  had 
visited,  while  others  drew  from  him  warm  approval. 

Besides  his  comments  on  the  museums  there  is 
much  in  the  journal  of  interest  otherwise — his  geological 
observations,  his  picturesque  descriptions  of  scenery 
and  of  life,  his  general  reflections,  and  his  touches  of 
humour,  peculiarly  characteristic  of  the  man,  all  tend 
to  enhance  the  value  of  the  small  MS.  volume  so  neatly 
written  in  his  own  hand. 

The  minutes  of  the  College  all  through  Mac- 
Gillivray's  tenure  of  office  in  its  Museum  contain 
evidence  of  its  entire  confidence  in  him,  and  they 
repeatedly  record  its  admiration  and  appreciation  of  his 
work.  The  Museum,  during  his  ten  years'  charge  of 
it,  was  kept  in  perfection  of  order  and  cleanliness,  while 
much  was  added  to  it  which  enhanced  its  value.  Every 
addition  (not  a  few  by  MacGillivray  himself)  was  at 
once  put  into  the  most  perfect  state  of  preservation, 
and  was  fitted  into  his  scientific  arrangement.  Nothing 
was  ever  left  out  of  order,  and  constant  cleaning  was 
rigidly  carried  out. 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        23 

From  a  minute  of  the  College,  dated  31st  March 
1834,  it  appears  that  MacGillivray  had  then  begun  to 
give  lectures  on  natural  history,  and  he  obtained  special 
permission  from  the  College  to  absent  himself  on 
Saturdays,  "  to  admit  of  his  giving  these  lectures  and 
to  have  scientific  excursions  with  his  pupils." 

There  is  an  interesting  and  amusing  paragraph  in  a 
minute  of  the  College  of  2nd  August  1834,  in  which  it 
is  stated  that  the  Curators  in  their  report  to  the 
College  "agree  to  a  sentiment  expressed  by  the  Con- 
servator that  it  has  been  noticed  to  him  that  low  and 
vulgar  persons  can  derive  no  benefit  from  visiting  the 
Museum,  but  that  it  was  obvious  to  him  that  such  a 
collection  is  calculated  to  remove  many  of  their  pre- 
judices and  that  without  information  all  men  would  be 
low  enough.  Besides,  he  added,  such  persons  are  the 
least  disposed  to  handle  anything." 

In  a  minute  of  3rd  August  1835  it  is  stated  that 
the  Curators  reported  that  the  catalogue  was  now 
completed,  and  that  all  the  preparations  then  stood  in 
the  order  of  it,  and  it  is  added :  "  This  work,  so  creditable 
to  the  College  and  so  calculated  to  increase  the  useful- 
ness of  it,  has  occupied  so  much  of  the  Conservator's 
time  and  attention,  and  has  been  so  materially  advanced 
by  his  assiduity  and  by  his  judicious  arrangements  as  to 
merit  some  species  of  acknowledgment  on  the  part  of 
the  College,  and  with  this  view  the  Curators  re- 
commend to  the  College  to  vote  him  a  gratuity  of 
twenty  guineas,  which  was  unanimously  agreed  to." 
In  the  minutes  throughout  the  remaining  six  years 


24  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

there  are  frequent  references  to  the  condition  of  the 
Museum,  which  was  always  in  the  perfection  of  order 
and  cleanliness,  MacGillivray's  predominating  views 
as  to  museums  being  that  the  order  should  be 
strictly  scientific,  and  that  everything  should  be  kept 
scrupulously  clean.  During  his  whole  tenure  of  office 
he  seems  to  have  been  allowed  an  almost  autocratic 
privilege  in  having  his  views  carried  out,  the  result 
always  being  the  entire  satisfaction  of  the  College. 

At  last  the  termination  of  his  career  as  Conservator 
of  the  Museum  seems  to  have  come  about  rather 
abruptly.  It  is  recorded  in  a  minute  of  the  College  of 
16th  March  1841  that  the  President  had  received  a 
letter  from  MacGillivray,  informing  him  that  he  had 
heard  from  the  Marquis  of  Normanby  that  he  had  been 
appointed  to  the  professorship  of  "  Civil  and  Natural 
History  "  in  Marischal  College,  Aberdeen,  and  that  he 
accordingly  resigned  the  conservatorship  of  the  Museum, 
as  from  the  last  day  of  April  following,  by  which  time 
he  said  he  hoped  it  would  be  in  perfect  order  for  a 
successor. 

The  minute  of  the  College  of  21st  April  following 
bears  that,  on  the  motion  of  the  President,  Dr.  Huie, 
seconded  by  Dr.  Maclagan,  the  College  "  unanimously 
resolved  to  put  on  record  the  high  sense  which  they 
entertain  of  the  value  and  efficiency  of  Mr.  MacGilli- 
vray's services  as  Conservator  of  the  Museum  of  the 
College  for  the  last  ten  years,  and  to  convey  to  him 
through  their  President  their  sincere  congratulations 
on  his  appointment  to  the  professorship  of  Civil  and 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         25 

Natural  History  in  Marischal  College,  together  with 
their  best  wishes  for  his  comfort  and  success  in  that 
new  department  of  public  duty." 

Thus  ended  MacGillivray's  career  in  connection 
with  the  Edinburgh  College  of  Surgeons,  in  the  course 
of  which  he  had  shown  in  a  marked  degree  those 
qualities  which  specially  fitted  him  for  the  higher  sphere 
of  usefulness  in  connection  with  the  science  to  which 
his  heart,  head,  and  time  had  been  so  zealously  and  so 
exclusively  devoted  for  upwards  of  twenty  years ;  and 
then  began  thejifth  and  final  period  of  his  life's  work. 

His  name  had  already  become  famous  as  an  orni- 
thologist by  the  publication  of  the  first  three  volumes 
of  his  History  of  British  Birds ;  but  before  referring 
specially  to  that  final  period,  some  account  must  be 
given  of  his  other  work  during  the  ten  years  of  his 
connection  with  the  Museum. 

These  museum  duties — constant  and  arduous  as  they 
were,  and  much  as  they  occupied  his  time  and  thought 
—formed  but  a  part  of  the  work  accomplished  by  him 
during  that  fourth  period  of  his  life.  Besides  his  lectures 
on  natural  history,  many  contributions  to  scientific 
periodicals,  including  the  article  "  Ornithology  "  to  the 
seventh  edition  of  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica,  the 
editing  of  the  Edinburgh  Journal  of  Natural  History 
and  Physical  Science,  from  1835  to  1840,  the  editing  of 
new  editions  of  several  books  on  natural  science,  writing 
a  condensation  of  Alexander  Von  Humboldt's  travels, 
the  lives  of  eminent  zoologists,  Descriptions  of  the 
Rapacious  Birds  of  Great  Britain,  published  in  1836, 


26  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

which  he  called  his  "  first  work,"  although  he  had  pre- 
viously published  many  original  papers,  translations, 
and  compilations,  "all  in  the  way  of  business,"  as  he 
says.  He  also  during  the  same  period  wrote  a  History 
of  British  Quadrupeds  for  Jardin's  Naturalist's  Library, 
Manuals  of  Botany,  Geology,  and  Zoology,  and  the 
first,  second,  and  third  volumes  of  his  History  of 
British  Birds — his  "  great  work,"  as  he  himself  calls  it 
by  anticipation  in  the  preface  to  the  Rapacious  Birds, 
the  remaining  two  volumes  having  been  issued  only 
shortly  before  his  death  in  1852. 

A  further  literary  undertaking  during  this  more 
than  busy  period  had  reference  to  Audubon's  Ornitho- 
logical Biographies.  He  wrote  the  whole  of  the  scien- 
tific part  of  that  work,  and  a  complete  synopsis  of  it. 
In  addition  to  all  his  writing,  he  was  also  occupied  in 
making  those  most  truthful  and  finely  artistic  drawings 
of  British  birds  in  water  colour,  now  in  the  British 
Museum. 

The  most  important  outcome,  however,  of  the 
ten  years'  work  consisted  in  the  three  volumes  of  the 
History  of  British  Birds,  to  which  the  patronage  of  Her 
late  Majesty  had  been  graciously  extended,  and  to  whom 
the  work  was  dedicated. 

The  object  which  he  sought  specially  to  accomplish 
in  the  publication  of  that  work  is  explained  by  him  in 
the  preface  to  the  first  volume  as  follows,  viz. — "  The 
object  I  had  in  view  when,  many  years  ago,  I  com- 
menced the  observations  recorded  in  this  work  was  at 
some  convenient  season  to  lay  before  the  public  descrip- 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        27 

tions  of  the  birds  of  Great  Britain,  more  extended,  and 
if  possible  more  correct,  than  any  previously  offered  ; " 
and  in  the  preface  to  the  Rapacious  Birds  he  says: 
"  Ornithology  can  be  successfully  prosecuted  only  by 
examining  the  internal  structure,  the  external  form,  the 
actions  and  habits,  the  distribution  and  the  various 
relations  of  the  objects  to  which  it  refers  ; "  adding,  "  all 
arrangements  of  birds  hitherto  published  are  merely 
artificial,  inasmuch  as  in  their  details  reference  is  had 
only  to  one  or  a  few  sets  of  organs."  He  further  says 
he  had  not  written  without  full  preparation,  having  been 
at  work  for  twenty  years  accumulating  facts  by  his  own 
observations  in  many  fields,  by  numerous  communica- 
tions with  other  observers,  by  examination  of  many 
specimens,  in  museums  and  in  his  own  possession, 
derived  from  various  parts  of  the  world,  and  by  dissec- 
tion of  such  birds  as  were  available  to  him. 

The  publication  of  the  History  of  British  Birds 
formed  the  commencement  of  a  new  era  in  ornithology, 
and  the  result  was  to  revolutionise  to  a  great  extent 
that  branch  of  natural  science.  It  was  in  accordance 
with  the  principles  indicated  in  the  above  quotations 
that  the  book  was  written,  and  its  value  from  a  scientific 
point  of  view  consists  in  its  having  been  so.  This  work 
had  the  effect  at  the  time  of  raising  its  author  to  the 
highest  position  in  Britain  as  an  ornithologist.  In  a 
subsequent  part  of  this  memorial  volume  several  ex- 
tracts from  MacGillivray's  works  are  given,  in  which 
he  fully  explains  and  vindicates  the  principles  on 
which  his  system  of  classification,  entirely  differing 


28  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

from  the  classification  of  previous  ornithologists,  was 
founded. 

But  since  that  time  the  advance  in  ornithology,  in 
every  aspect  of  it,  has  been  enormous.  Many  have 
followed  the  line  of  treatment  initiated  by  MacGillivray, 
and  most  writers,  since  the  publication  of  the  Origin  of 
Species,  have  gone  much  further,  in  the  light  of  the 
principles  of  evolution  and  natural  selection.  Every 
organ  and  feature  of  the  bird,  both  internal  and  external, 
has  been  made  the  subject  of  the  most  minute  examina- 
tion, with  results  directly  bearing  on  the  principles  of 
classification.  These  results  and  the  present  advanced 
stage  of  this  most  attractive  branch  of  science  are  well 
and  shortly  explained  in  the  recently  published  Structure 
and  Classification  of  Birds  by  Mr.  Beddard.  Still  the 
origin  of  the  movement  and  the  direction  it  has  taken 
are  due  to  MacGillivray. 

He  betrays  oftener  than  once  in  his  works  a  pro- 
phetic consciousness  that,  while  he  felt  he  was  groping 
in  the  dark,  the  dawn  of  greater  light  was  near ;  but 
how  far  he  would  have  been  able  to  accept  the  prin- 
ciples of  Darwin  may  be  uncertain.  His  belief  in  the 
separate  creation  of  each  species,  and  in  its  permanency 
as  so  created,  appears  to  have  been  strong,  when  the 
introduction  to  the  first  volume  of  his  History  of 
British  Birds was  written.  In  it  he  says:  "  Species  alone 
exist  in  nature,"  while  "  genera,  families,  orders,  and  all 
the  mediate  sections  of  a  class  must  ever  remain  fluctu- 
ating ; "  and  that  while  species  "  are  more  or  less  allied 
to  each  other,  they  exist  in  an  order  conformable  to  the 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         29 

plan  of  their  creation."  His  religious  views,  too,  un- 
doubtedly deep  and  sincere,  were  quite  in  harmony 
with  his  views  as  to  the  creation  of  species.  He 
saw  God  everywhere  in  nature ;  and  as  his  scientific 
knowledge  deepened  and  widened,  the  more  did  the 
Creative  Mind  reveal  itself  to  him  in  intelligent  adapta- 
tion and  design  for  the  accomplishment  of  specific  ends. 
Everything,  as  it  existed,  was  to  him  the  direct  result 
of  an  original  forth -putting  of  Creative  Power  and 
design,  while  his  reverence  for  that  Power  increased 
as  his  scientific  knowledge  extended  and  deepened. 
Although  the  form  of  his  religious  belief,  like  the  form 
of  his  poetry,  was  very  much  that  of  the  preceding 
century,  its  reality  and  intensity  were  of  his  time,  and 
peculiarly  his  own  individually.  Would  his  restricted 
scientific  views  as  to  species,  with  his  form  of  religious 
belief,  have  prevented  him  from  accepting  the  Dar- 
winian theories  of  evolution  and  natural  selection  ? 
Would  he  have  been  able,  with  his  ardent  love  of 
truth  and  his  capacity  for  clear  insight  into  nature,  to 
accept  the  Darwinian  theory  of  evolutionary  progres- 
sive creation  in  place  of  the  view  that  all  things  were 
made  at  a  beginning  out  of  nothing,  each  species,  age 
after  age,  simply  reproducing  itself,  although  subject 
to  much  and  constant  variation  within  its  specific 
limitations  ? 

It  is  not  improbable  that  he  would  have  got  entirely 
over  the  then  existing  wall  of  separation  between  the 
past  and  the  present  of  all  scientific  systems.  Indeed, 
notwithstanding  his  views  as  to  species  indicated  in  the 


30  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

above  quotations,  and  his  form  of  religious  belief,  there 
are  passages  in  his  Manual  of  Botany,  published  three 
years  after  his  first  volume  of  British  Birds,  which 
appear  to  show  that  his  views  had  been  undergoing 
a  change,  as  in  that  work  he  says :  "  There  is  nothing 
absolutely  certain  as  to  species,"  that  "  species  often 
pass  into  each  other  by  gradations  which  render  it 
impossible  to  draw  a  line  of  demarcation,  and  thus 
all  species  are  more  or  less  arbitrary ; "  while  in  his 
geological  teaching  he  had  quite  abandoned  those 
views  as  to  creation  which  so  hampered  Hugh  Miller 
to  the  last,  and  led  to  his  fanciful  theory  of  interpreta- 
tion of  the  first  chapter  of  Genesis.  In  the  epitome 
of  his  lectures  as  dictated  to  his  class  in  Marischal 
College,  he  says :  "  Species  have  not  changed  during 
historical  times,"  apparently  implying  that  they  may 
have  changed  during  longer  prehistoric  periods  ;  and, 
again,  in  that  epitome  he  says  "  the  most  perfected 
animals  appear  to  have  been  created  last,"  thus  assuming 
that  there  had  been  successive  creations — not  one  only, 
once  for  all.  He  was  absolutely  free  from  prejudice, 
always  kept  his  eyes  open,  and  constantly  insisted  on 
ascertained  fact  as  the  only  legitimate  basis  of  theory  : 
while  his  love  of  truth  and  strict  adherence  to  it  formed, 
it  may  be  said,  the  backbone  of  his  life  and  of  his  work. 
He  was  eminently  worthy  of  the  Gaelic  name  he  bore, 
"  Gillivray  " — servant  of  the  truth  ;  and  the  publication 
of  The  Origin  of  Species  would  probably  have  been 
hailed  by  him  as  the  rising  of  a  new  sun  in  the  heaven 
of  science,  and  as  bringing  the  light  for  which  he  had 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE  AND   WORK        31 

been  prophetically  looking.  He  would  probably  have 
been  able  to  see  God's  creative  power  in  nature  not  less 
clearly  and  reverently  than  before — creative  by  a  never- 
ceasing  evolutionary  process,  a  continual  progressive 
unfolding  of  the  essential  being  of  all  existences — an 
endless  change  and  growth  of  organic  form  making 
clearer  to  him  the  full  significance  of  those  very  prin- 
ciples of  classification  which  he  had  already  adopted, 
with  a  deeper  insight  into  the  facts  of  nature  on  which 
they  rested,  and  which,  through  the  mind  of  Darwin, 
had  come  to  the  scientific  mind  of  the  age  as  a  new 
and  great  revelation. 

But  besides  the  scientific  aspect  of  the  History  of 
British  Birds,  that  "great  work"  has  other  features 
which  will  always  preserve  its  interest  and  attractive- 
ness to  many  readers  who  may  be  unable  to  enter 
intelligently  into  the  author's  scientific  descriptions  and 
deductions.  The  narratives  of  his  excursions — often 
by  night  as  well  as  by  day ;  the  difficulties  encountered 
— at  times  with  no  little  danger,  especially  while 
scrambling  among  the  rocks  of  the  Outer  Hebrides, 
or  climbing  the  cliffs  of  Ben  Macdhui ;  his  descriptions 
of  scenery — now  overpowering  in  its  ruggedness  and 
grandeur,  and  again  tenderly  soothing  in  its  soft  and 
varied  beauty,  amid  which  he  wandered  in  the  pursuit 
of  knowledge  of  the  habits  and  modes  of  life  of  his 
feathered  friends,  are  often  extremely  fascinating,  and 
all  the  more  so  when  such  scenes  are  enlivened  by  a 
solitary  raven  on  its  crag,  or  by  a  couple  of  sea  eagles 
wheeling  about  on  wing  high  above  his  hiding-place, 


32  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

or  by  flocks  of  sea  birds  of  all  varieties  wandering  over 
a  flat  sandy  shore,  with  the  sea  far  out  on  a  bright 
sunny  morning,  in  search  of  their  early  meal,  or  by  a 
grey  and  yellow  wagtail,  as  seen  by  him  on  the  banks 
of  the  Braid  Burn  one  summer  day  while  walking  along 
its  course.  "  How  pretty  and  pleasantly  thou  runnest," 
he  writes,  "  along  the  sandy  margin  of  the  brook.  The 
pattering  of  thy  tiny  feet  can  be  heard  only  by  fairy 
ears ;  so  light  is  thy  tender  frame,  which  vibrates  as  if 
thy  joints  were  too  delicate  and  thy  muscles  too  sensi- 
tive for  thee  to  fix  them  for  a  moment  in  rest.  The 
gentle  breeze,  that  scarce  bends  the  young  grass,  curves 
the  long  feathers  of  thy  tail,  and  the  sudden  blast  sweeps 
thee  away  quivering  and  emitting  thy  shrill  notes,"  etc. 
It  concludes  :  "  It  is  pleasant  to  me  to  gaze  upon  thee, 
thou  marvellous  epitome  of  mind  and  matter,  so  har- 
moniously organised."  The  passage  is  given  at  length 
in  the  latter  part  of  this  volume,  and  it  will  be  seen 
how  lovingly  sympathetic  it  is  throughout  with  the 
tiny  creature,  which  for  the  time  had  completely 
drawn  his  affections  towards  it. 

But  every  feathered  creature,  from  the  most  powerful 
and  relentless  bird  of  prey  to  the  smallest  and  most 
harmless  of  the  race,  attracted  his  sympathy  as  he 
found  it  in  its  native  habitat  and  congenial  sur- 
roundings. 

Of  the  ravens  at  Loch  Tulloch  he  says  :  "  It  is  very 
pleasant  to  hear  the  ravens  on  the  crags  talking  to  each 
other  in  great  variety  of  accents — one  answering  the 
call  of  another.  Poor  fellows !  if  the  glen  were  mine 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        33 

I  would  give  strict  orders  not  to  molest  them ;  for  next 
to  the  eagle — now  altogether  destroyed — the  raven  is 
the  greatest  ornament  of  such  a  scene." 

Indeed  there  was  no  bird  to  be  found  in  all  his 
wanderings  which  did  not  draw  a  warmth  of  sympathy 
from  his  kindly  heart ;  and  there  are  many  passages  in 
his  book  on  British  birds,  which,  for  picturesque  beauty, 
poetic  feeling,  or  tender  sympathy  with  nature  and 
every  living  creature  that  came  under  his  observation, 
can  scarcely  be  surpassed.  Yet  he  never  allowed  his 
sympathetic  feeling,  or  his  appreciation  of  the  pictur- 
esque to  interfere  with  his  proper  work  as  a  scientific 
ornithologist.  To  learn  the  facts  about  the  habits  and 
lives  of  living  birds  was  the  main  object  of  his  many 
wanderings ;  and  his  power  of  imagination  and  sym 
pathetic  susceptibility,  in  place  of  hindering,  helped 
much,  in  his  case,  to  the  readier  and  clearer  perception 
of  those  facts,  and  to  his  capacity  for  making  them 
more  vividly  and  attractively  apparent  to  others — to 
the  non- scientific  as  well  as  to  the  scientific. 

There  is  another  feature  of  the  writer's  mind  of 
much  interest,  which  betrays  itself  in  many  passages 
of  his  "great  work,"  as  well  as  in  his  other  works 
— that  is  an  ever-present  sense  of  the  deep  mystery 
of  Nature  and  of  the  limits  of  his  power  of  insight, 
however  much  he  had  been  able  to  see  more  than 
others  of  his  generation.  He  was  intensely  worshipful 
at  Nature's  shrine — all  his  best  thought  and  feeling 
often  rising  into  reverential  awe,  and  his  heart  over- 
flowing with  gratitude  and  thankfulness  to  the  Author 

D

of  all  that  beauty  and  glory  which  constituted  for  him 
its  supreme  and  abiding  interest. 

The  illustrations  in  his  History  of  British  Birds, 
drawn  by  himself,  and  consisting  principally  of  the 
heads  and  feet  of  birds,  besides  being  scientifically 
accurate,  are  fine  specimens  of  art,  each  being  strik- 
ingly expressive  of  the  character  of  the  species  of  bird 
represented.  As  examples,  nothing  could  be  finer 
than  the  head  of  the  golden  eagle,  or  of  the  sea  eagle, 
or  of  the  raven,  or  the  magpie. 

But  these  illustrations,  good  as  they  are,  come  far 
short  of  his  water -coloured  drawings  of  birds  in  the 
British  Museum  already  referred  to.  They  are  beautiful 
works  of  art,  executed  with  great  delicacy  and  care — 
in  expression,  in  attitude,  and  in  their  natural  surround- 
ings, just  as  he  had  seen  them  with  his  own  eyes.  Yet 
they  are  little  known  outside  the  walls  of  the  Natural 
History  Department  of  the  Museum.  Modest  as  he 
habitually  was,  he  did  realise  that  there  were  things 
which  he  could  do  better  than  other  people,  and  he 
spoke  the  simple  truth  when  he  said  that,  in  his  day, 
no  one  could  draw  a  bird  except  Audubon  and  himself. 

But  besides  his  work  as  conservator  of  the 
Surgeon's  Museum  and  all  his  own  scientific  and 
literary  work,  he  undertook,  as  has  been  said,  to  aid 
Audubon  in  the  preparation  of  his  Ornithological 
Biographies  for  the  press.  He  was  introduced  by 
Mr.  James  Wilson  (Christopher  North's  brother)  to 
Audubon  when  that  eminent  American  ornithologist 
was  arranging  for  the  publication  of  his  great  work 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         35 

in  Edinburgh  in  1830.  Audubon  writes  in  his  journal, 
recently  published  by  his  grand-daughter,  Miss  Marion 
R.  Audubon :  "I  know  I  am  a  poor  writer,  that  I 
scarcely  can  manage  to  scribble  a  tolerable  English  letter 
and  not  a  much  better  one  in  French,  though  that  is 
easier  to  me.  I  know  I  am  not  a  scholar,  but,  mean- 
time, I  am  aware  that  no  man  living  knows  better 
than  I  do  the  habits  of  our  birds ;  no  man  living  has 
studied  them  so  much  as  I  have  done,  and,  with  the 
assistance  of  my  old  journals  and  memorandum  books, 
which  were  written  on  the  spot,  I  can  at  least  put 
down  plain  truths  which  may  be  useful  and  perhaps 
interesting,  so  I  shall  set  to  at  once.  I  cannot,  how- 
ever, give  scientific  descriptions  and  here  must  have 
assistance." 

Thus  Audubon  wrote  on  16th  October  1830  in 
his  lodgings,  26  George  Street,  his  residence  during 
all  the  time  he  was  in  Edinburgh. 

The  co-operation  of  Audubon  and  MacGillivray 
in  the  production  of  the  Ornithological  Biographies  is 
thus  referred  to  by  Mr.  D.  G.  Elliot  in  an  address 
to  the  New  York  Academy  of  Sciences  on  16th 
April  1893.  He  says  :  "  No  better  or  more  fortunate 
choice  could  have  been  made.  Audubon  worked 
incessantly,  MacGillivray  keeping  abreast  of  him ; 
and  Mrs.  Audubon  rewrote  the  entire  manuscript  to 
send  to  America  to  secure  the  copyright." 

The  late  Dr.  Coues,  in  his  Key  to  North  American 
Birds,  second  edition,  1884,  says  of  Audubon :  "  Vivid 
and  ardent  was  his  genius ;  matchless  he  was,  both  in 


36  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

pen  and  pencil,  in  giving  life  and  spirit  to  the  beautiful 
objects  he  delineated  with  passionate  love ;  but  there 
was  a  strong  and  patient  worker  by  his  side,  William 
MacGillivray,  the  countryman  of  Wilson,  destined  to 
lend  the  strong  Scotch  fibre  to  the  Audubonian 
epoch.  The  brilliant  French  -  American  naturalist 
was  little  of  a  scientist.  Of  his  work,  the  magical 
beauties  of  form  and  colour  and  movement  are  all 
his ;  his  page  is  redolent  of  nature's  fragrance  ;  but 
MacGillivray's  are  the  bone  and  sinew,  the  hidden 
anatomical  parts  beneath  the  lovely  form,  the  nomen- 
clature, the  classification,  in  a  word  the  technicalities 
of  the  science." 

Mrs.  Audubon,  writing  from  Edinburgh  to  her 
sons  in  America,  says :  "  Nothing  is  heard  but  the 
steady  movement  of  the  pen ;  your  father  is  up  and  at 
work  before  dawn,  and  writes  without  ceasing  all  day. 
Mr.  MacGillivray  breakfasts  at  nine  each  morning, 
attending  the  Museum  four  days  in  the  week,  has 
several  works  on  hand  besides  ours,  and  is,  moreover, 
engaged  as  a  lecturer  in  a  new  seminary  on  botany 
and  natural  history.  His  own  work  progresses  slowly 
but  surely."  The  date  of  this  letter  does  not  appear, 
but  it  could  not  have  been  written  during  Mac- 
Gillivray's earlier  years  as  conservator  of  the  Museum, 
as  he  must  then  have  been  fully  occupied  more  than 
four  days  a  week  with  the  arduous  and  anxious  work 
connected  with  the  removal  and  subsequent  rearrange- 
ment of  the  museum  contents.  In  1833,  and  again  in 
1834,  he  had,  as  already  mentioned,  obtained  the 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         37 

permission  of  the  College  to  absent  himself  from  the 
Museum  on  Saturdays  only. 

Audubon,  in  the  introduction  to  the  first  volume 
of  his  Ornithological  Biographies,  published  by  Adam 
Black,  Edinburgh,  in  1831,  says  :  "  I  feel  pleasure  in 
acknowledging  the  assistance  I  have  received  from  a 
friend,  Mr.  William  MacGillivray,  who,  being  possessed 
of  a  liberal  education  and  a  strong  taste  for  the  study 
of  the  natural  sciences,  has  aided  me,  not  in  drawing 
the  figures  of  my  illustrations,  nor  in  writing  the  book 
now  in  hand,  although  fully  competent  for  both  tasks, 
but  in  completing  the  scientific  details  and  in  smoothing 
down  the  asperities  of  my  Ornithological  Biographies. 

Again,  in  the  introduction  to  the  fourth  volume, 
published  in  November  1838,  Audubon  writes  :  "With 
reference  to  a  vast  number  of  specimens  " — which  had 
been  sent  him  from  America — "an  account  of  the 
digestive  organs  and  trachea  of  these,  generally  concise, 
but  occasionally  of  considerable  length,  you  will  find 
under  the  articles  to  which  they  refer  in  the  present 
volume.  Their  anatomical  descriptions,  as  well  as  the 
sketches  by  which  they  are  sometimes  illustrated,  have 
been  executed  by  my  learned  friend,  William  Mac- 
Gillivray, who  in  the  most  agreeable  manner  consented 
to  undertake  the  labour,  by  no  means  small,  of  such  a 
task,  and  to  whom  those  who  are  interested  in  the 
progress  of  ornithological  science,  as  well  as  myself, 
must  therefore  feel  indebted."  There  then  follows  a 
sentence  in  which  he  prophesies  that  the  time  is 
approaching  when  museums  filled  with  stuffed  skins 


38  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

will  not  be  considered  sufficient  to  afford  a  knowledge 
of  birds,  and  when  the  student  will  not  only  go  forth 
to  observe  the  habits  of  birds  but  to  procure  specimens 
for  careful  dissection,  thus  showing  the  effect  of 
MacGillivray's  teaching  and  example  on  a  man  who, 
although  he  knew  much  of  the  habits,  lives,  and 
exterior  of  birds,  was  "  no  scientist." 

Audubon,  on  finally  departing  for  America,  left  his 
son  Victor  to  finish  the  work  of  publication,  and  he 
wrote  to  him  as  follows : — "  You  have  my  journals, 
all  necessary  facts,  and  in  yourself  sufficient  ability  to 
finish  the  letter-press  with  the  assistance  of  our  worthy 
friend,  John  Bechman,  as  well  as  MacGillivray." 

From  these  quotations  it  is  clear  that  Mac- 
Gillivray's part  in  the  preparation  of  the  Ornithological 
Biographies  must  have  involved  much  anxious,  laborious 
and  constant  work,  requiring  the  greatest  care  and 
judgment,  over  a  period  of  eight  years,  and  that  work 
must  have  added  much  to  his  other  constantly  en- 
grossing occupations.  Yet  nothing  which  came  from 
his  pen  shows  haste ;  and  everything  he  did  was  done 
with  patience,  with  care  and  with  accuracy.  Care, 
patience,  and  accuracy  were  elements  in  his  nature 
which  no  circumstances,  however  pressing,  could 
counteract  or  overcome. 

His  labours  in  connection  with  Audubon's  work 
terminated  in  1839,  when  the  Synopsis.,  which  was 
wholly  prepared  by  him,  was  finished  and  published. 

MacGillivray,  as  appears  from  many  passages  in  his 
British  Birds,  appreciated  much  the  warm  friendship 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         39 

of  Audubon,  and  he  frequently  acknowledges  his  in- 
debtedness to  him  for  information  and  specimens 
which  were  of  great  importance  to  him  in  connection 
with  his  own  work. 

His  book  on  the  Rapacious  Birds  of  Great  Britain 
was  dedicated  to  "  John  James  Audubon,  in  admiration 
of  his  talents  as  an  ornithologist,  and  in  gratitude 
for  many  acts  of  friendship."  Although  the  two 
men,  as  Dr.  Coues  says,  were  in  most  respects  very 
unlike  each  other,  they  were  both  men  of  generous 
mind  and  warm  heart,  having  common  interests, 
with  reference  to  which  each  was  willingly  helpful 
to  the  other,  Audubon,  no  doubt,  gaining  most  by 
the  friendship,  which  greater  gain  was  willingly 
and  ungrudgingly  conceded  by  MacGillivray  to  his 
friend. 

MacGillivray  and  his  family  then  lived  at  No. 
1  Wharton  Place,  now  no  longer  in  existence,  its 
site  being  occupied  by  part  of  the  buildings  of  the 
Royal  Infirmary.  Their  immediate  neighbour  was 
the  late  Mr.  Fraser,  the  successor  of  Dr.  Neill  of 
Canonmills  Lodge  in  his  well-known,  old-established 
printing  business.  The  MacGillivray,  the  Audubon, 
and  the  Fraser  families  were  on  terms  of  close  friend- 
ship with  each  other ;  and  Mr.  Alexander  Fraser, 
Wimmera,  Bruntsfield  Place,  Edinburgh,  lately  of 
Canonmills  Lodge,  son  of  MacGillivray 's  friend,  who 
was  then  a  boy,  still  remembers  with  pleasure  the 
friendly  meetings  in  one  or  other  of  the  three  family 
residences,  and  he  specially  mentions  one  such  meeting 


40  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

in  Audubon's  rooms  when  John  MacGillivray  (Mac- 
Gillivray's  eldest  son),  carelessly  flourishing  a  stick, 
broke  a  glass  case  in  which  Audubon  kept  one  of  his 
ornithological  treasures,  to  the  great  disappointment 
and  annoyance  of  the  naturalist.  Mr.  Fraser  also 
relates  how  he,  John  MacGillivray,  and  John 
Audubon,  then  both  lads  like  himself  (afterwards 
eminent  naturalists)  were  wont  to  go  out  on  bird- 
shooting  expeditions,  when  on  one  occasion  they 
were  caught  in  Ravelston  Woods,  rather  roughly 
handled,  and  had  their  gun  taken  from  them. 


5. — PROFESSOR  OF  NATURAL  HISTORY  IN  MARISCHAL 
COLLEGE  AND  UNIVERSITY,  ABERDEEN,  1841  TO 
1852 — "  HISTORY  OF  BRITISH  BIRDS  "  COMPLETED 
— "NATURAL  HISTORY  OF  DEESIDE  AND  BRAE- 
MAR  " — DEATH. 

As  already  mentioned,  MacGillivray  in  1841  entered 
on  a  new  and  extended  sphere  of  eminent  usefulness,  as 
Professor  of  Natural  History  in  Marischal  College, 
Aberdeen,  a  sphere  for  which  he  was  specially  qualified, 
and  which  was  altogether  congenial  to  him.  Then 
began,  as  has  been  said,  the  fifth  period  of  his  life.  His 
chair  included  zoology,  geology,  and  botany,  this  latter 
being  a  separate  lectureship.  All  of  these  branches  he 
had  made  subjects  of  special  study,  and  had  published, 
as  mentioned  before,  a  manual  on  each  of  them  while 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE  AND   WORK        41 

he  was  in  Edinburgh.  His  scientific  many-sidedness 
fitted  in  well  with  the  varied  character  of  his  work  in 
his  new  position,  while  that  position  at  the  same  time 
afforded  him  opportunities  for  still  further  self-develop- 
ment in  accordance  with  the  bent  of  his  mind  and  in 
the  lines  of  his  varied  previous  extensive  acquire- 
ments. 

In  Marischal  College  he  found  himself  in  direct 
contact  with  many  young  inquiring  minds.  To  instruct 
and  to  guide  these  was  henceforth  to  be  the  main 
business  of  his  life.  He  devoted  himself  to  this  work 
with  all  his  energies,  mental  and  physical,  and  with 
a  warmth  of  sympathetic  interest  rarely  found  in  the 
occupants  of  a  professorial  chair.  There  was  earnest- 
ness and  reality  in  all  he  said  and  did — in  his  lectures, 
in  his  excursions  into  surrounding  districts,  frequently 
with  his  students  in  search  of  zoological  or  botanical 
specimens,  or  for  examination  of  geological  phenomena. 
These  excursions  often  involved  long  and  fatiguing 
walks,  but  his  youthful  companions,  inspired  by  his 
spirit,  always  felt  that  what  they  had  gained  in 
knowledge  from  discoveries  made  under  his  guid- 
ance, in  instruction  then  received  or  illustrated,  or 
in  pleasure  from  his  kindly  and  courteous  companion- 
ship, much  more  than  compensated  for  the  fatigues 
undergone. 

MacGillivray  brought  new  life  into  Marischal 
College,  while  the  specially  interesting  nature  of  his 
lectures  and  the  attractiveness  of  his  personality 
drew  to  his  classes  many  students  whose  curriculum 


42  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

did  not  include  the  subjects  of  his  teaching.  Even 
brother  professors,  unable  to  resist  his  magnetic 
influence,  were  not  unfrequently  seen  on  the  benches 
in  front  of  him.  The  late  Professor  Blackie, 
then  occupant  of  the  Humanity  Chair  in  Marischal 
College,  actually  enrolled  himself  as  one  of  his 
students ! 

An  example  of  MacGillivray's  wonderful  aptitude 
for  work  connected  with  his  chair,  and  of  the  rapidity, 
and  at  the  same  time  careful  accuracy,  with  which  he 
was  able  to  accomplish  it,  was  the  preparation  and 
publication,  within  two  years  of  his  appointment,  of 
his  History  of  the  Mollusca  of  the  North- East  of 
Scotland.  That  work  includes,  with  very  full  descrip- 
tions, upwards  of  300  species,  all  of  which,  except 
one,  had,  he  says,  been  carefully  examined  by  him- 
self, while  he  had  gathered  two  -  thirds  of  them 
with  his  own  hands — about  twenty  being  new  to 
science. 

In  the  work  of  collecting  he  was  aided  by  mem- 
bers of  his  own  family,  by  students,  and  by  friends 
resident  in  various  parts  of  the  adjoining  districts, 
all  of  whom,  inspired  by  him,  were  more  than 
willing  to  contribute  to  his  work  any  aid  in  their 
power. 

In  his  preface  to  that  book  he  remarks  : — "  I  present 
it "  (the  book)  "  with  confidence  to  the  public,  because  I 
am  conscious  of  having  produced  it  with  great  care,  and 
because  I  think  it  will  be  useful."  It  was  intended, 
he  says,  for  his  pupils  and  persons  commencing  the 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE  AND   WORK        43 

study  of  mollusca ;  and  on  that  account,  he  adds, 
he  had  made  the  descriptions  fuller  than  usual,  as 
he  was  anxious  "to  induce  them  to  go  beyond  mere 
nomenclature  and  to  make  themselves  acquainted 
with  the  structure  and  relations  of  the  objects 
described." 

He  further  observes,  with  justifiable  but  modest 
pride  and  prophetic  forecast,  that  it  was  the  "first 
zoological  work  that  has  emanated  from  the  University 
of  which  I  am  a  member,  and  I  cannot  but  look  upon 
it  as  indicating  the  not  distant  dawn  of  an  era  destined, 
I  trust,  to  produce  investigations,  the  importance  of 
which  will  tend  to  give  our  city  a  rank,  certainly  not 
yet  acquired,  among  those  distinguished  for  the  cultiva- 
tion of  Natural  History." 

That  prophecy  has  to  a  large  extent  been  ful- 
filled, and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  is  mainly 
through  his  work  and  inspiring  influence  that  it  has 
been  so. 

MacGillivray  occupied  his  chair  eleven  years,  dis- 
charging his  duties  with  the  energy,  intelligence,  and 
independence  of  view  which  formed  so  essential  features 
of  his  character.  In  the  course  of  his  many  excur- 
sions and  otherwise  he  accumulated  a  large  collection 
of  zoological  specimens,  which  he  arranged  into  an 
excellent  private  museum,  with  the  capacity  for 
scientific  order  which  was  so  natural  to  him.  That 
museum  was  used  by  him  to  great  advantage  as  illus- 
trative of  his  teaching,  and  it  is  now  the  property  of 
the  Aberdeen  University.

His  students  always  held  him  in  the  greatest  respect, 
and  many  of  them  were  warmly  devoted  to  him.     He 
was  accustomed   to  treat  them  as   friends  ;    and  one 
former  student,  recently  referring   to   him,   says :    "I 
had  a  very  great  regard  for  him  not  only  as  an  orni- 
thologist but  as  a  man.     He  was  exceedingly  lovable 
and  undoubtedly  the    first   ornithologist    in    Europe, 
and    we    were   all   proud   of    his    fame.       One  thing 
always   made   a  great  impression  on  me :    he  treated 
his   class   as  men    and    gentlemen,    and    we    recipro- 
cated  his   action.      It   was   far   otherwise   with  some 
of  the   professors."      Another   Aberdeen    student    of 
his  day,  but   who  was  not  in  his  class,  lately  a  pro- 
fessor   in    a   Canadian    university,    now    dead,   writes 
of  him  as  follows :  "  He  was  about  my  own  height " 
(rather  below   medium  stature),    "firm  of  step,  erect 
of  gait,  as  he  trod  the  pavement  of  Broad  Street  or 
wound  his  way  through  the   Gallowgate   to  the  Old 
Town ;   great  of  reputation  among  British  birds,  and 
tireless,  pedestrianising  with  his  class  among  the  hills 
and  heather  of  Deeside.      He  could  walk   the   most 
active  of  them  into  limp  helplessness,  and  remain  as 
fresh  as  at  the  outside  of  the  march."     "Keep  your 
knees  bent  as  you  climb  a  mountain.     You  thus  avoid 
having  to  raise  your  body  at  each  step,"  was  his  advice 
to  another  student  who  had  accompanied  him  in  hill 
climbing. 

Many  others  of  his  former  students  refer  to  him 
in  similar  terms  of  warm  eulogy,  those  features  of  his 
character  which  appear  to  be  most  prominent  in  their 


SKETCH   OF    LIFE   AND   WORK        45 

memory  being  his  eminence  as  a  scientist,  especially  in 
ornithology ;  the  attractiveness  of  his  lectures,  with  his 
happy  mode  of  illustration  ;  his  readiness  to  undertake 
any  work,  however  arduous,  in  the  interest  of  his  science 
or  his  class,  and  his  specially  kind  consideration  of  his 
students. 

In  the  words  of  the  member  of  his  class  last  men- 
tioned, "  his  interest  in  the  habits  of  his  students  was 
remarkable.  If  he  saw  a  good  student  careless  he  would 
remonstrate  with  him  privately  ;  while  earnest  atten- 
tion gained  his  favour.  With  his  rapid  power  of  obser- 
vation he  could  detect  even  a  temporary  lapse  from 
diligence.  His  lectures  were  carefully  written  out, 
and  he  dictated  an  epitome  of  them  once  a  week. 
Now  and  then  he  gave  out  a  subject  for  an  essay,  say 
'  The  Sparrow,'  and  he  indicated  a  preference  for  a 
paper  bearing  on  its  habits  and  life  on  the  street  and  on 
the  wing.  As  an  examiner  he  was  patient,  tender,  and 
gentle,  unwilling  to  say  an  angry  word.  He  would 
rather  help  out  the  hesitating  student ;  but  it  was 
easy  to  see  that  carelessness  was  an  abomination  to 
him." 

There  appears  to  have  been  much  in  MacGillivray's 
considerate  and  kindly  manner  towards  his  students 
which  strikingly  accords  with  Dr.  Barclay's  treatment 
of  him  as  his  pupil.  The  two  young  men  were  evi- 
dently much  alike  in  the  essential  features  of  their 
character,  and  in  all  probability  the  influence  of  the 
kind  friend  and  dutiful  teacher  left  an  impress  on 
MacGillivray's  mind  which  time  never  effaced,  and 


46  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

which  more  or  less  influenced  for  good  his  whole  after 
life. 

In  the  autumn  of  1850  he  spent  a  holiday  of  about 
a  month  with  his  son  Paul  and  his  eldest  daughter  on 
a  pedestrian  excursion  to  the  upper  part  of  the  valley 
of  the  Dee  and  Braemar,  his  main  object,  as  he  explains 
in  his  last  written  book,  The  Natural  History  of 
Deeside  and  Braemar,  having  been  to  examine  the 
"geological  structure  of  Braemar,  its  Alpine  vegeta- 
tion, and  to  a  certain  extent  its  zoology."  Full  details 
of  that  excursion  and  of  its  results  are  given  in  that 
book,  which,  besides  its  scientific  value,  is  in  several 
respects  the  most  interesting  and  fascinating  of  his 
works.  There  is  an  unpretending  simplicity  in  its  style, 
while  not  a  page  is  without  interest,  resulting  either 
from  the  attractiveness  of  the  personality  of  the 
narrator,  as  it  comes  out  in  connection  with  every 
detail,  however  trivial  in  itself,  or  from  the  pleasant 
surprise  at  the  unexpected  discovery  of  some  Alpine 
plant,  or  the  observed  effect  of  a  mass  of  eruptive 
rock  as  specially  bearing  on  the  geological  character  of 
the  district,  or  from  a  strikingly  picturesque  view, 
or  from  an  incidental  reflective  thought  associated  with 
the  aspect  of  an  object  or  scene  which  had  specially 
impressed  him,  in  which  he  gives  utterance  to  his 
deepest  thoughts  or  breathes  out  his  most  tender 
feelings  or  his  holiest  aspirations.  There  are  more  of 
such  passages  in  that  book  than  in  any  of  his  other 
works  within  the  same  compass.  His  sense  of  awe  in 
the  presence  of  the  Great  Mystery  of  Nature  appears 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK         47 

to  have  been  deepened.  Religious  thought  had  grown 
in  him  to  greater  maturity,  and  had  come  to  dominate 
in  a  sense  his  science  and  his  life,  yet  not  so  as  to 
prevent  him  from  seeing  the  facts  of  nature  as  he  had 
always  seen  them  or  from  drawing  from  them  without 
bias  the  deductions  which  they  appeared  to  him  to 
warrant. 

In  his  preface  to  that  book  he  says :  "  If  the 
Valley  of  the  Dee  has  many  a  time  been  traversed  by 
the  wise  and  the  learned,  the  man  of  science  and  the 
man  of  wit,  the  poet,  the  painter,  and  the  tourist,  it  is 
equally  instructive  to  the  naturalist,  who  ought  in  his 
own  person  to  represent  all  these."  In  his  case  the  ideal 
naturalist  was  realised,  for  he  did  combine  all  these 
characteristics  in  himself.  He  was  eminently  the  man 
of  science  ;  he  had  the  heart  and  the  imagination  of  the 
poet  and  the  painter,  and  he  was  the  patient,  plodding 
pedestrian  tourist,  easily  accommodated  with  lodging 
and  food  wherever  he  went, — in  his  earlier  days  not 
unfrequently  sleeping  under  the  open  canopy  of  heaven 
after  supping  on  a  piece  of  oatcake  and  a  few  mouthfuls 
of  water  from  a  spring. 

It  would  do  injustice  to  most  of  the  finer  passages 
in  the  book  to  attempt  to  quote  them  partially,  but  one 
— a  very  touching  one,  near  the  end,  can  be  so  quoted 
without  such  risk  :  "  The  Divine  Providence,"  he  says, 
"  has  rendered  my  path  pleasant  to  me  in  the  rugged 
corrie,  in  the  thick  wood,  and  in  the  green  valley  ;  has 
prepared  friends  to  forward  my  views,  to  protect  me 
under  their  hospitable  roofs,  and  instruct  me  by  their 


48  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

conversation ;  has  restored  me  to  health  and  preserved 
it  to  me ;  has  enabled  me  to  accomplish  the  purpose  of 
my  journey,  and  filled  me  with  gratitude  now  that  I 
approach  its  termination." 

It  is  believed,  however,  that  although  he  felt  at  the 
time  that  he  had  benefited  in  health  by  the  excursion, 
the  fatigues  to  which  he  had  subjected  himself  had  been 
really  detrimental  to  it.  He  became  so  ill  a  few  weeks 
before  the  end  of  the  College  term  of  1850-51  that  he 
was  obliged  to  relinquish  his  class  duties  for  the 
remainder  of  that  term,  these  having  been  undertaken  for 
him  by  a  former  student,  now  the  Rev.  Dr.  Farquharson, 
for  the  last  forty -two  years  the  much -esteemed  (now 
senior)  parish  minister  of  Selkirk.  MacGillivray  was  un- 
able to  enter  on  his  class  duties  for  the  session  1851-52, 
and  the  same  gentleman  acted  as  his  substitute  again  for 
the  whole  of  that  session.  Accompanied  by  his  eldest 
daughter,  he  went  to  Torquay  for  his  health  in  the  late 
autumn  of  1851,  and  while  there  his  wife  died  suddenly 
in  Aberdeen  in  February  1852.  On  8th  March  following, 
when  still  at  Torquay,  he  published  the  fourth  volume 
of  his  History  of  British  Birds — just  fourteen  years  after 
the  issue  of  the  third  volume — and  in  the  preface  to  it  he 
makes  the  following  very  touching  reference  to  his  posi- 
tion at  Torquay  at  the  time :  "  As  the  wounded  bird 
seeks  some  quiet  retreat  where,  freed  from  the  persecution 
of  the  pitiless  fowler,  it  may  pass  the  time  of  its  anguish 
in  forgetfulness  of  the  world,  so  have  I,  assailed  by 
disease,  betaken  myself  to  a  sheltered  nook  where, 
unannoyed  by  the  piercing  blasts  of  the  North  Sea,  I 


SKETCH    OF  LIFE  AND   WORK        49 

had  been  led  to  hope  that  my  life  might  be  protected 
beyond  the  most  dangerous  season  of  the  year.  It  is 
thus  that  I  issue  from  Devonshire  the  present  volume, 
which,  however,  contains  no  observations  of  mine  made 
there,  the  scenes  of  my  labours  being  in  distant  parts  of 
the  country." 

The  fifth  and  concluding  volume  of  his  "  great  work  " 
was  published  on  31st  July  of  the  same  year,  after  his 
return  to  Aberdeen,  and  on  8th  September  following 
he  died  in  his  residence  in  Crown  Street  of  that 
city. 

The  "  Conclusion "  at  the  end  of  that  volume  is 
calmly  but  deeply  pathetic.  In  it  the  writer  says  : 
"  I  have  been  honest  and  sincere  in  my  endeavour  to 
promote  the  truth.  With  death  apparently  not  distant 
before  my  eyes,  I  am  pleased  to  think  I  have  not 
countenanced  error  through  fear  or  favour.  Neither 
have  I  in  any  case  modified  my  sentiments  so  as  to 
endeavour  thereby  to  conceal  or  palliate  my  faults." 
The  "  Conclusion,"  from  beginning  to  end,  forms  a 
most  touching  "Finis"  to  all  his  life's  labours.  It 
shows  that  he  fully  realised,  in  quiet,  self-possessed 
consciousness,  that  the  end  of  his  life's  work  was  near ; 
and  the  great  outstanding  features  of  his  mind — an 
unquenchable  love  of  truth  and  profoundly  reverential 
worship  of  the  Creator  of  all  that  organic  life  which 
formed  the  subject  of  his  untiring  investigations — come 
prominently  out  in  it.  That  conclusion  is  given  fully 
as  the  final  extract  from  his  works  in  this  volume,  and 
it  forms  an  appropriate  ending  to  it.

It  is  difficult  now  to  realise  what  Professor  Mac- 
Gillivray's  loss  to  natural  science  then  was  felt  to  be 
— the  loss  of  "  the  most  eminent  ornithologist  in 
Europe,"  as  he  has  been  truly  designated.  The  loss, 
too,  of  a  man  who  was  so  devout,  so  generous,  so  self- 
denying,  so  warm-hearted,  so  painstaking,  so  energetic, 
and  so  conscientious  in  the  discharge  of  duty  and  in 
the  carrying  out  of  any  purpose  to  which  he  felt  he 
had  a  call — who  can  tell  what  that  was  except  those 
who  had  the  privilege  of  personal  relationship  with  him 
as  scientists  or  as  friends,  or  as  members  of  his  own 
bereaved  family ! 

He  had  thirteen  children,  several  of  whom  died  in 
infancy  or  childhood.  His  two  sons,  John  and  Paul, 
became  eminent  in  natural  science.  John  was  naturalist 
on  three  scientific  exploring  expeditions  sent  out  by 
the  Government,  viz.  (1)  that  of  the  Fly,  commanded 
by  Captain  Blackwood,  to  Torres  Straits  and  the 
Eastern  Archipelago,  to  which  he  was  appointed  in 
1842,  when  he  was  only  eighteen  years  of  age,  and  from 
which  he  returned  in  1846  ;  (2)  in  the  end  of  the  same 
year  the  Rattlesnake  expedition,  under  Captain  Owen 
Stanley  (Professor  Huxley,  then  an  assistant  surgeon  in 
the  Royal  Navy,  being  also  of  the  staff) ;  and  on  his  return 
from  that  expedition  in  1850  he  wrote  an  account  of  it, 
which  was  published  in  1852  ;  and  (3)  later  in  that  year 
he  was  appointed  to  the  Herald  expedition  to  the 
coasts  of  South  America  and  the  South  Pacific,  under 
Captain  Denholm.  He,  however,  left  the  Herald  on 
its  arrival  at  Sydney  in  1855,  and  thereafter  devoted 


SKETCH   OF   LIFE   AND   WORK        51 

his  life  to  scientific  explorations  in  Australia  and  the 
Pacific  Islands.  His  constitution  ultimately  giving 
way  from  exposure  and  the  fatiguing  nature  of  his 
work,  he  died  at  Sydney  in  1867.  It  is  said  that  he 
left  journals  of  his  expeditions  and  work  of  exploration, 
including  amongst  much  else  the  results  of  special 
observation  and  study  of  the  habits  of  the  aborigines. 
These  journals,  the  writer  has  heard,  are  still  in  exist- 
ence in  Sydney,  and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  there 
is  much  in  them  that  would  be  of  extreme  interest  to 
scientists  as  well  as  to  many  other  readers.  It  is  there- 
fore hoped,  if  they  do  exist,  that  they  will  yet  be  per- 
mitted to  see  the  light  of  day. 

Paul  also  settled  in  Australia,  and  became  an 
eminent  surgeon,  but  latterly  devoted  himself  almost 
entirely  to  natural  science,  and  made  a  large  collection 
of  specimens,  which  is  now  in  the  Museum  of  Natural 
History,  Melbourne.  He  died  a  few  years  ago,  and  a 
monument  has  been  erected  at  Bendigo,  his  former 
residence,  to  his  memory.  A  third  son,  who  died  early, 
also  showed  a  strong  predilection  for  natural  science, 
and,  had  he  lived,  might,  it  was  believed,  have  rivalled 
his  two  distinguished  brothers.  So  that  the  love 
of  natural  science  was  strong  in  the  blood  of  that 
family. 

Dr.  Donald  William  MacGillivray,  a  younger 
brother  of  the  Professor,  followed  the  medical  profes- 
sion. He  was  educated  for  it  at  the  University  of 
Edinburgh,  living  in  family  with  his  elder  brother 
while  attending  the  classes  there.  After  taking  his 


52  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

medical  degree  he  returned  permanently  to  the 
Hebrides.  He  at  first  settled  for  the  practice  of  his 
profession  and  for  farming  in  South  Uist,  but  the  late 
Mr.  Gordon,  the  proprietor  both  of  South  Uist  and  the 
Island  of  Barra,  who  entertained  a  warm  friendship 
for  him,  offered  him  the  tenancy  of  the  large  and 
important  farm  of  Eoligary  in  Barra,  to  which  he 
removed,  and  there  carried  on  extensive  and  successful 
farming  for  many  years,  at  the  same  time  giving  the 
inhabitants  of  the  island  the  benefit  of  his  medical 
advice  gratuitously.  He  was  much  trusted  and  highly 
respected  by  the  islanders,  and  indeed  by  all  who  had 
the  privilege  of  knowing  him  as  a  friend  or  otherwise  ; 
and  when  he  died  at  Eoligary  in  February  1886,  in  the 
seventy-seventh  year  of  his  age,  he  was  much  missed 
and  sincerely  mourned.  He,  like  his  eminent  elder 
brother,  was  interested  in  the  ornithology  of  the 
Hebrides,  as  is  also  one  of  his  sons,  Mr.  William 
Lachlan  MacGillivray,  now  of  Eoligary,  who  has  a  fine 
ornithological  collection  there,  and  has  made  not  a  few 
presentations  of  birds  and  eggs  of  special  interest  to 
the  Edinburgh  Natural  History  Museum.  The  natural 
history  blood  therefore  appears  to  run  in  that  branch  of 
the  MacGillivray  family  also.

PRESENTATION  OF  THE  MEMORIAL  MURAL 
TABLET  TO  THE  UNIVERSITY  OF  ABER- 
DEEN. 

AN  interesting  ceremony  took  place  on  Tuesday  20th 
November  1900,  in  the  Natural  History  Class-room  at 
Marischal  College,  when  Mr.  John  F.  White,  LL.D., 
on  behalf  of  the  subscribers,  presented  to  the  Principal, 
as  representing  the  University,  a  mural  tablet  to  the 
memory   of    William     MacGillivray,    M.A.,    LL.D., 
Professor  of  Natural  History  and  Lecturer  on  Botany 
in  Marischal  College  from   1841    to    1852.     Amongst 
those    present    were    Principal    Marshall    Lang,    Mr. 
John    F.    White,     LL.D.,    Dundee;    Lord    Provost 
Fleming,  Professors  Cowan,  Pirie,  Trail,  Cash,  Dove 
Wilson,    Reid,     M' William,     Hamilton,    Nicol,     and 
Arthur   Thomson ;    Mr.    A.    W.    Gibb,    Lecturer   on 
Geology;    Mr.    P.    J.    Anderson,    Mr.   D.    R.    Thorn, 
Dr.   Tait,   Inverurie ;  Rev.  Mr.   Johnstone,  Belhelvie ;

54  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

Principal  Lang  said — Ladies  and  Gentlemen, — You 
know  the  object  of  our  present  assembly,  and  I  shall 
at  once  ask  Dr.  Forbes  White,  whom  we  are  glad  to 
see  amongst  us  to-day,  to  state  the  object  of  the  meeting, 
and  address  us  in  regard  to  that  object  and  to  perform 
the  duty  that  he  shall,  in  his  graceful  way,  perform. 

Dr.  John  F.  White,  who  was  received  with 
applause,  said  —  It  is  with  some  reluctance  that  I 
appear  before  you  to-day  to  perform  an  important 
duty.  The  position  I  occupy  should  have  been  filled 
by  the  Rev.  Dr.  Mair  of  Earlston,  Chairman  of  the 
MacGillivray  Committee,  and  a  distinguished  graduate 
of  our  University,  whom  failing,  by  the  Rev.  Dr. 
Farquharson,  late  of  Selkirk,  the  secretary  and  moving 
spirit  of  the  movement,  and  the  favourite  pupil  of 
Professor  MacGillivray.  But  owing  to  the  infirm 
health  of  both  of  these  gentlemen,  which  I  much  regret, 
I  have  been  asked  to  undertake  the  duty  which  they 
would  have  discharged  much  more  efficiently.  I  do 
so,  however,  with  sincere  pleasure,  as  it  gives  me 
the  opportunity  of  expressing  my  life-long  gratitude 
to  an  honoured  teacher,  one  of  the  three  professors 
to  whom  I  owe  most.  Professor  MacGillivray  was 
appointed  to  the  Chair  of  Natural  History  in  Marischal 
College  and  University  in  1841,  and  died  in  1852. 
During  the  last  two  years  of  his  tenure  of  office  his 
health  broke  down,  so  that  his  real  work  as  professor 
was  done  in  nine  short  years.  Yet  how  much  work 
did  he  crowd  into  this  brief  space  of  time  1  In  winter 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  55 

he  lectured  on  natural  history ;  in  summer  on  botany. 
He  made  researches  on  foot  over  the  whole  of  the 
north-eastern  district,  making  observations  in  every 
department  of  natural  science.  He  completed  his 
monumental  work  on  the  History  of  British  Birds, 
with  several  text-books  and  biographies  of  eminent 
naturalists  and  other  works,  and  last  of  all  his 
Natural  History  of  Deeside — a  goodly  amount  of  hard, 
earnest  work.  He  was  buried  in  the  New  Calton 
Bury  ing- Ground  of  Edinburgh,  the  city  he  loved  so 
dearly,  and  in  which  he  had  done  good  work  before 
coming  to  Aberdeen.  Arthur  Seat  and  Salisbury 
Crags  seem  to  have  been  graven  on  his  heart.  It  is 
somewhat  discreditable  to  both  cities  that  almost  half 
a  century  has  elapsed  before  any  public  honour  has 
been  done  to  his  memory.  Yet  this  delay  has  not 
been  without  its  advantages.  Fifty  years  have  con- 
firmed the  impressions  of  his  old  students,  and,  further, 
have  given  us  the  approval  of  a  younger  race  of 
naturalists.  It  is  gratifying  to  us  to  know  that  none 
have  taken  a  deeper  interest  in  our  movement  than  Pro- 
fessors Trail  and  Thomson,  MacGillivray's  successors 
in  the  University.  Professor  Trail  has  been  untiring 
in  his  aid  from  the  beginning.  But  still  further,  this 
long  lapse  of  time  has  given  a  better  perspective  to 
MacGillivray's  position.  We  see  him  in  larger  pro- 
portions —  we  now  know  that  he  was  more  than  a 
great  naturalist  and  fine  teacher.  His  last  work,  the 
Natural  History  of  Deeside,  published  by  command  of 
the  Queen  three  years  after  his  death,  shows  him  to 


56  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

have  been  a  profound  lover  of  Nature  in  its  largest 
sense.  In  clear,  nervous  prose  it  reveals  a  fine  poetic 
vein.  He  uses  his  word -palette  like  a  landscape 
painter.  There  are  passages  in  this  book  which  for 
splendid  yet  sober  description  will  compare  not  un- 
favourably with  some  of  the  finest  passages  in  Modern 
Painters,  and  it  must  be  remembered  that  Mac- 
Gillivray's  book  was  written,  though  not  published, 
before  Ruskin  had  surprised  the  world.  Take,  for 
instance,  MacGillivray's  splendid  apostrophe  to  the 
upper  reach  of  the  Dee  as  seen  from  the  old  bridge 
at  Invercauld,  or  his  word-picture  of  the  sunset  over 
the  moor  of  Glen-Gairn,  or,  again,  for  the  effect  of 
sound  to  which  MacGillivray  was  peculiarly  sensitive, 
listen  to  a  wind -storm  raging  among  the  pines  of 
Beallach  Bhui,  or,  greatest  of  all,  to  the  echoing  and 
re-echoing  of  the  peals  of  thunder  in  the  corries  of 
Ben  Muick  Dhui.  In  these  numerous  passages  Mac- 
Gillivray tells  us  that  his  descriptions  were  written  in 
his  note-book  on  the  spot  and  at  the  moment,  quick 
and  vivid,  thus  showing  his  truly  artistic  spirit  and 
his  impressionable  nature.  In  his  drawings  for  the 
book  we  can  see  also  how  completely  he  combined 
his  geological  knowledge  with  a  painter's  feeling.  In 
the  very  last  words  which  flowed  from  his  pen,  at 
the  close  of  his  fine  preface,  he  describes  his  ideal 
naturalist  when  he  says — "If  the  Valley  of  the  Dee 
has  many  a  time  been  traversed  by  the  wise  and  the 
learned,  the  man  of  science  and  the  man  of  wit,  the 
poet,  the  painter,  and  the  tourist,  it  is  equally  in- 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  57 

structive  to  the  naturalist,  who  ought  in  his  own 
person  to  represent  all  these  characters."  Here,  with 
modest  unconsciousness,  MacGillivray  describes  him- 
self. It  is  on  these  lofty  grounds — of  his  all-round 
completeness — that  he  claims  our  admiration  to-day. 

But  I  must  turn  to  MacGillivray's  work  in  his 
class,  and  here  I  must  notice  how  easily  he  attracted 
to  his  special  subjects  even  those  students  whose  bias 
lay  rather  towards  classics  and  mathematics.  For  it 
was  a  noticeable  fact  that  many  of  his  best  prizemen 
were  not  students  of  science,  but  of  the  other  subjects. 
I  do  not  know  exactly  whether  it  was  owing  to  the 
magnetic  influence  of  the  earnest  Professor,  or  whether 
it  was  that  such  students  were  attracted  by  the  fresh 
study  of  Nature,  hitherto  to  us  a  sealed  book,  but  this 
I  can  say,  that  even  the  students  of  literature  felt  that 
there  was  no  antagonism  between  the  two  pursuits, 
but  rather  that  the  one  was  complementary  to  the 
other.  We  felt  that  new  powers  were  being  awakened 
within  us ;  that  the  hitherto  dormant  faculties  of 
observation,  comparison,  classification,  and  generalisa- 
tion were  receiving  a  new  stimulus.  It  is  true  that 
many  of  these  students  have  drifted  into  other  pursuits 
and  lines  of  study,  but  the  influence  of  MacGillivray's 
methods  and  spirit  abides  indelible.  They  are 
applicable  to  art  as  well  as  to  science,  truth  in  both 
cases  being  the  ultimate  aim. 

MacGillivray's  lectures  were  formal  and  precise,  full 
of  detail — perhaps  overladen  with  detail,  as  I  see  from 
four  thick  volumes  of  notes  taken  by  me  in  his  class. 


58  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

But  as  he  always  illustrated  by  specimens,  even  these 
details  were  not  felt  burdensome.  He  was  perhaps  the 
last  of  the  race  of  all-round  naturalists,  though  he  had 
the  accuracy  of  a  specialist  in  many  departments. 
Ornithology  was  his  favourite,  his  strongest  subject,  of 
which  the  best  proof  is  to  be  found  in  his  monumental 
work  in  five  volumes  on  the  History  of  British  Birds. 
He  was  also  Lecturer  on  Botany,  as  well  as  Professor  of 
Natural  History,  and  his  edition  of  Withering's  Botany 
was  practically  a  new  work  by  MacGillivray.  Though 
the  botany  class  was  not  in  the  old  curriculum,  yet 
many  arts  students  attended  it,  attracted  by  the  per- 
sonality of  the  lecturer.  He  was  an  excellent  miner- 
alogist, while  his  text-book  on  geology  was  abreast  of 
the  age.  He  was  the  first  professor  in  the  University 
to  give  a  strictly  scientific  course  of  lectures  on  geology, 
a  science  which  was  then  beginning  to  attract  the  atten- 
tion of  theologians.  The  Vestiges  of  Creation  had 
appeared  in  the  early  forties,  and  clergymen  attended 
MacGillivray's  class  in  numbers  to  hear  what  science 
had  to  say  in  regard  to  the  age  and  creation  of  the 
world.  Professors  came  also  ;  among  others  Professor 
Blackie,  always  eager  for  knowledge,  enrolled  himself  as 
a  student.  In  my  own  year,  the  late  Principal  Pirie, 
then  Professor  Pirie  of  the  Theological  Faculty  in 
Marischal  College,  was  a  regular  attender,  and  he  gave 
a  prize  for  a  special  examination  in  geology.  But 
MacGillivray's  activity  did  not  end  here.  His  Manual 
of  the  Mollusca  of  the  North -Eastern  Counties  sent 
many  classical  and  mathematical  students  twice  or 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  59 

thrice  weekly  to  the  Fishers'  Square,  Footdee,  to  com- 
plete their  collections  and  to  search  for  the  rare  speci- 
mens to  be  found  in  the  baskets  of  the  deep  -  sea 
fishermen.  When  there  was  difficulty  in  identifying  the 
specimen  from  the  manual,  it  was  taken  to  MacGillivray. 
It  was  at  times  like  these  that  MacGillivray  was  seen 
at  his  best.  Holding  the  specimen  tenderly  in  his  taper 
fingers,  and  applying  to  it  a  lens,  he  would  descant  on 
the  difference  or  want  of  difference  between  a  variety 
and  a  species.  These  were  the  half-hours  in  which 
Matthews  Duncan,  Thomas  Keith,  and  Charles  Murchi- 
son  received  their  first  lessons  in  science,  long  before 
they  took  to  the  study  of  medicine,  in  which  they 
afterwards  became  famous.  It  was  then  that  the  Rev. 
Dr.  James  Farquharson  acquired  early  that  knowledge 
which  enabled  him,  when  he  had  just  taken  his  M.A. 
degree,  to  conduct  for  more  than  two  years  the  classes 
of  natural  history  and  of  botany  during  MacGillivray 's 
last  illness,  and  afterwards  led  him  to  take  an  active 
part  in  the  work  of  the  Berwickshire  Naturalists'  Club 
during  his  forty  years'  residence  in  Selkirk.  It  was 
under  this  sort  of  stimulus  that  Dr.  Thomas  Jamieson 
of  Ellon  threw  himself  into  the  geological  studies 
which  have  since  made  him  the  recognised  authority  in 
Scotland  in  regard  to  the  alluvial  deposits.  It  was 
MacGillivray  that  led  Andrew  Leith  Adams,  son  of 
the  great  Banchory  scholar,  to  devote  himself  when  a 
surgeon  in  the  army  to  prolonged  studies  in  natural 
history,  studies  which  led  to  his  retirement  from  the 
army  to  occupy  a  chair  in  Queen's  College,  Cork.  In 


60  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

this  class-room  there  sat  for  many  years  the  late  Dr. 
Alex.  Cruickshank,  storing  his  mind  with  the  secrets  of 
the  Nature  he  loved  so  well,  the  joy  of  his  life.  It  is  to 
these  studies  that  the  University  and  the  city  owe  the 
munificent  gift  of  our  Botanic  Gardens,  presented  by 
Miss  Cruickshank  in  memory  of  her  brother.  I  could 
give  the  names  of  many  schoolmasters,  such  as  James 
Anderson  of  Foveran,  men  who  carried  their  love  of 
natural  science  into  their  several  parishes,  studying  the 
works  of  Nature  themselves,  and  inculcating  her  lessons 
on  their  pupils.  From  such  influences,  carried  further 
by  MacGillivray's  successors  in  the  University,  a  wide- 
spread love  of  Nature  has  grown  among  working  men, 
who  in  their  various  societies  dignify  their  labours  by 
such  studies — a  solace  from  hard  manual  toil. 

There  are  still  some  persons  left  in  Aberdeen  who 
can  remember  the  personal  appearance  of  the  man. 
Under  medium  height,  spare  in  form,  shy  and  reserved 
in  manner,  he  walked  swiftly  along  the  street,  generally 
alone,  with  his  head  inclined  downwards  and  his  eyes 
bent  towards  the  ground,  wrapt  in  his  own  thoughts. 
Celt  of  the  Celts,  he  was  singularly  courteous  and 
polite,  with  fine  quiet  dignity,  but  when  offended  he 
could  use  sharp  words  which  left  their  sting.  He 
made  few  friends,  but  once  made  he  clung  to  them 
with  tenacity.  His  life  was  in  his  work  and  in  his 
home.  There  can  be  no  finer  proof  of  the  beauty  of 
his  life  than  that  every  member  of  his  large  family 
laboured  with  him  and  for  him,  both  sons  and  daughters, 
attracted  to  the  work  by  love  and  sympathy.  John, 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  61 

the  eldest  son,  became  the  naturalist  on  the  Rattlesnake 
in  the  scientific  voyage  in  which  Professor  Huxley  also 
served.  Paul  made  his  mark  in  the  Flora  of  Aberdeen- 
shire,  and  afterwards  in  researches  in  Australia,  where 
he  died.  While  all  the  daughters  assisted  their  father, 
special  reference  must  be  made  to  the  two  excellent 
pen-and-ink  tail -pieces  by  Miss  MacGillivray  which 
adorn  the  "  Deeside  "  volume.  For  delicacy  and  refine- 
ment they  recall  the  work  of  Sir  George  Reid,  P.R.S.A., 
and  I  can  give  them  no  higher  praise. 

Had   sufficient    money   been   at   our   disposal,   we 
should    have    adopted    the    suggestion    of    Sir    John 
Struthers  and  founded  a  gold  medal  in  MacGillivray's 
memory  in  the  University.      But,  failing  in  this,  we 
have  had  to  content  ourselves  with  a  monument  at  his 
grave  by  Mr.  M'Glashen  of  Edinburgh,  in  fine  Peter- 
head  granite,  about  9  feet  high.     The  design  would  have 
pleased  MacGillivray.     Near  the   foot  is  a  good-sized 
golden  eagle,  the  royal  bird  much  loved  by  the  orni- 
thologist, the  extinction  of  which  in  the  Scottish  High- 
lands  he  deeply  lamented.      It  fittingly  suggests  the 
lofty  aspirations  of  MacGillivray.     The  eagle  is  finely 
executed  in  bronze  by  Mr.  D.  W.  Stevenson,  R.S.A., 
from  a  splendid  drawing  of  the  bird  by  MacGillivray 
himself,  now  the  property  of  the  British  Museum.     The 
monument    is   adorned   with   Celtic   ornament,   which 
befits  the  tombstone  of  our  naturalist,  who  held  that 
Gaelic  was  the  most  beautiful  language  in  the  world. 
In  the  centre  is  a  fine  lona  cross,  symbol  of  the  earnest 
faith  of  the  reverent  MacGillivray.     The  bronze  tablet 


62  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

is  made  by  "  The  Guild  of  Handicraft "  of  London,  from 
the  design  of  Mr.  Ashbee,  whose  work  is  well  known. 
It  is  adorned  with  artistic  representations  of  some  of  the 
flowers  and  animals  which  were  the  friends  of  the  man 
whose  memory  we  wish  to  honour.  The  inscription 
reads — "In  memory  of  William  MacGillivray,  M.A., 
LL.D.,  born  1796,  died  1852.  Author  of  a  History  of 
British  Birds,  and  other  standard  works  in  natural 
science;  Professor  of  Natural  History  and  Lecturer 
on  Botany  in  Marischal  College  and  University  from 
1841  to  1852.  Erected  in  1900,  together  with  a  monu- 
ment at  his  grave  in  New  Calton  Cemetery,  Edinburgh, 
by  his  relatives  and  surviving  students,  who  affection- 
ately cherish  his  memory,  and  by  others  desirous  of 
doing  honour  to  his  character  as  a  man  and  to  his 
eminence  as  a  naturalist." 

At  this  point  Dr.  White  unveiled  the  tablet,  and 
briefly  outlined  its  artistic  features. 

Dr.  White,  continuing,  said — It  is  altogether  a  work 
designed  in  the  spirit  of  the  man  whom  we  wish  to 
honour,  and  we  think  and  believe  that  in  every  respect 
it  would  have  met  with  the  approval  of  our  friend. 
And  now,  Principal  Lang,  in  the  name  of  the  sub- 
scribers, I  hand  over  to  your  care  this  bronze  tablet, 
to  be  set  up  in  a  fitting  place  in  the  University  as  a 
memorial  of  a  great  naturalist  and  distinguished  pro- 
fessor. It  represents  also  the  hope  of  the  subscribers 
that  this  tablet  may  stimulate  future  generations  of 
students  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  William  Mac- 
Gillivray and  emulate  his  virtues. 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  63 

Principal  Lang  said — Dr.  Forbes  White,  on  behalf 
of  the  University,  I  accept  with  gratitude  the  custody 
of  the  tablet  which  has  been  unveiled.  I  take  it  from 
you,  for  you  assured  me  of  this  before  I  saw  it,  that 
both  in  its  conception  and  in  its  execution  this  work 
reflects  the  highest  credit  upon  the  artist.  But  its 
merit  is  enhanced  by  its  association  with  the  name  of 
one  whose  splendid  service  in  Marischal  College,  whose 
devotion  to  natural  science,  and  whose  acknowledged 
eminence  both  as  author  and  teacher  have  shed  lustre 
on  the  annals  of  this  ancient  seat  of  learning.  The 
biography  to  which  you  have  so  felicitously  and  tenderly 
alluded  is  inspiring,  whilst  it  is  also  pathetic.  Born  in 
the  old  city  of  Bishops  Elphinstone  and  D  unbar,  the 
city  whose  presidium  et  dulce  decus,  next  after  the 
venerable  Cathedral,  is  the  Grey  Crown  of  King's 
College — never  did  son  of  the  north  more  admirably 
exemplify  those  qualities  of  persistency  in  purpose,  of 
indomitable  courage,  of  the  surrender  of  the  mere  self- 
life  to  a  selected  aim,  which  have  distinguished  so  many 
natives  of  the  northern  counties.  What  a  picture  is 
suggested  in  the  tale  of  the  young  Aberdonian  trudging 
on  foot  from  Aberdeen  to  London,  with  a  meagre 
supply  of  money  in  his  pocket,  a  scanty  wardrobe  in 
his  wallet — his  wealth  consisting,  indeed,  in  his  journal, 
in  his  copy  of  Smith's  Flora  Britannica,  and  in  his  own 
brave  heart.  The  lad  who  could  do  that  had  in  him  the 
stuff  of  which  heroes  are  made.  And  so,  we  follow 
him  ascending  rung  by  rung  the  ladder  which,  planted 
against  the  Hill  of  Difficulty,  reaches  to  the  place  of 


64  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

Fame.  He  succeeded,  and  he  deserved  to  succeed. 
He  who  left  his  own  city,  a  young  Aberdonian,  without 
wealth  and  without  friends,  returned  to  Aberdeen  the 
Professor  of  Natural  History,  with  a  name  among  the 
mighty  men,  and  with  a  great  career  stretching  before 
him.  For  eleven  years  he  taught  and  laboured  — 
observing,  classifying,  studying,  and  writing ;  his  the 
pen  of  the  ready  writer,  and  his  the  tongue  ready  like 
the  pen.  Eleven  years  only,  and  at  fifty-six  he  was  not. 
A  long  life  was  not  his ;  yet,  if  we  count  time  by  heart- 
throbs, by  feelings,  not  by  figures  on  a  dial,  how  much 
and  how  worthily  had  he  lived !  Some  of  his  old 
students — two  of  them  you  have  mentioned  to-day — 
Dr.  Mair  and  Dr.  Farquharson — have  been  my  warm 
friends ;  and  the  enthusiasm  with  which  they  recall  his 
magnetic  personality,  his  luminous  exposition,  his  walks 
and  talks  as  he  led  them  afield,  and  showed  them  the 
things  of  interest  and  beauty  about  the  paths  they  trod, 
is  in  itself  a  testimony  to  the  manner  of  man  he  was. 
It  is  strange,  indeed,  that  for  forty-eight  years  the  grave 
in  the  New  Calton  Burying  -  Ground  in  Edinburgh 
should  have  been  left  unmarked  except  by  the  two 
letters,  W.  M.,  on  the  low  corner-stones.  He  did  not 
need  a  monument.  His  voluminous  works,  placing  him 
in  the  forefront  of  British  naturalists,  are  a  monument 
more  enduring  than  bronze  or  even  granite ;  and 
there  is  a  suggestion  of  him  in  every  trill  of  the  little 
songsters  which  he  loved,  and  whose  ways  and  story  he 
has  so  graphically  unfolded.  But  why  was  it,  we  are 
tempted  to  ask,  that  those  who  knew  him  allowed  nearly 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  65 

five  decades  to  pass  before  they  originated  an  effort  to 
express  in  some  form  their  veneration  for  his  memory  ? 
Well,  is  it  not  a  striking  evidence  of  the  vitality  of  the 
affection  with  which  his  memory  is  cherished  that  you, 
sir,  should,  in  the  name  of  many  besides,  pay  the 
eloquent  tribute  you  have  paid  to  him — and  that  we, 
many  of  us  having  no  recollection  whatever  of  him, 
associate  ourselves  with  you  in  paying  honour  ungrudg- 
ingly and  freely  to  the  distinguished  teacher,  to  the 
distinguished  scientist,  and  to  the  man  greatly  beloved. 
It  shall  be  the  care  of  the  University  to  guard  the  token 
of  that  honour  which  you  have  presented.  And  from 
the  walls  of  this  College  it  shall  speak  to  generations  to 
come  of  one  whom  all  may  follow  in  the  love  and 
service  of  truth  ;  and  following  whom,  "  all  may  have, 
if  they  dare  choose,  a  glorious  life  or  glorious  grave." 

Professor  Trail,  who  at  the  outset  read  a  letter  of 
apology  for  absence  from  Mr.  Robert  Walker,  secretary 
of  the  University  Court,  said — I  did  not  know  Professor 
MacGillivray  personally,  but  I  have  learned  to  know 
him  in  a  way  that,  I  think,  perhaps  not  very  many  know 
him,  through  his  works ;  and  through  these  I  have 
learned  to  revere  the  man  and  to  love  his  memory,  and 
to  join  heart  and  soul  in  the  movement  that  has  been 
carried  through  so  far.  I  regret  that  we  have  not  been 
able  to  provide — I  will  not  say  a  more  fitting  memorial, 
but  one  that  would  have  appealed  more  directly  to  the 
students  to  encourage  them  to  follow  in  his  footsteps. 
They  will  find  it  difficult  to  emulate  him.  While  still

a  student  in  this  University,  and  after  I  had  completed 
my  medical  curriculum,  by  Professor  Nicol's  wish  I 
spent  much  time  in  the  Natural  History  Museum, 
working  over  the  collections  of  animals,  many  of  which 
had  been  received  unnamed,  and  required  to  be  deter- 
mined and  prepared  for  exhibition.  I  also  went  care- 
fully over  the  older  collections,  both  of  animals  and  of 
fossils,  making  good  the  damage  sustained  in  the  course 
of  years.  In  this  work  I  obtained  a  practical  training 
of  very  great  value,  and  was  prepared  to  estimate  the 
difficulty  of  carrying  on  such  work  with  imperfect 
resources  in  books  and  other  means  of  information,  and 
while  having  to  rely  on  one's  own  judgment.  During 
my  work  I  had  occasion  to  become  well  acquainted 
with  Professor  MacGillivray's  collections  preserved  in 
the  Museum.  The  neatness  of  his  writing  and  methods 
were  conspicuous  in  all  his  work ;  but  admiration  of 
this  was  soon  followed  by  respect  and  honour  as  1  came 
to  know  more  fully  the  width  and  accuracy  of  that 
work.  From  his  collections  I  turned  to  his  writings,  to 
find  only  still  stronger  reason  for  wonder  that  he  could 
have  found  opportunity  to  write  so  much,  and  on  so  widely 
different  sides  of  natural  science.  But  still  higher  rose 
my  respect  for  his  talents  as  I  realised  that  he  was  no 
mere  compiler,  but  that  all  he  wrote  showed  that  he 
had  learned  in  practical  study  what  he  sought  to  teach. 
Unwearied  industry  at  the  command  of  great  talent 
alone  could  have  enabled  him  to  do  so  much  and  so 
well.  His  manuals  on  botany  and  on  geology  show 
that  his  knowledge  of  these  sciences  was  not  that  of  a 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  67 

mere  amateur.  They  incidentally  reveal  that  his  beliefs 
on  various  questions  were  in  accord  with  those  now 
held  rather  than  with  those  prevalent  when  he  expressed 
them.  For  example,  in  his  Manual  of  Botany.,  issued 
in  1840,  he  says — "There  is  nothing  absolutely  certain 
as  to  species,  much  less  as  to  the  groups  into  which  they 
are  disposed,  as  genera,  families,  orders,  tribes,  and  the 
like.  We  merely  agree  to  consider  as  species  individual 
plants  which  closely  resemble  each  other  in  the  structure 
and  form  of  their  organs.  Such  species,  however,  often 
pass  into  each  other  by  gradations,  which  render  it 
impossible  to  draw  a  line  of  demarcation,  and  thus  all 
species  are  more  or  less  arbitrary.  We  know  from 
observation  that  all  assumed  species  undergo  changes 
from  climate,  cultivation,  and  other  influences ;  and 
individuals  exhibiting  remarkable  alterations  we  call 
collectively  varieties  ;  but  variety  is  a  still  more  vague 
idea  than  species."  He  edited  in  one  volume  a  reduced 
form  of  Withering's  Botany.  That  this  service  to 
British  botany  was  considerable  was  proved  by  numerous 
editions  of  the  book  in  this  form,  each  of  those  issued 
before  his  death  being  revised  by  him.  His  interest  in 
botany  and  geology  are  further  shown  by  papers  pub- 
lished in  scientific  journals,  and  by  one  of  his  latest 
works,  the  Natural  History  of  Deeside.  But  zoology 
was  his  favourite  science  ;  and  his  books  and  papers  on 
branches  of  zoology  are  many  and  valuable.  All  come 
fresh  to  the  student  as  the  work  of  a  man  that  tells  of 
what  he  saw  in  language  remarkable  in  style  as  well  as 
in  accuracy.

Throughout  his  writings  one  feels  that  he  wrought 
his  work  not  for  fame  or  vainglory,  but  that  that  work 
was  to  him  its  own  reward,  and  that  he  felt  the  power 
to  perceive  and  in  some  measure  to  express  the  message 
to  man  that  pervades  the  universe  constrained  him  to 
communicate  to  others  what  meant  so  much  to  himself. 
In  his  writings  one  meets  now  and  again  a  lament  (the 
only  one  he  makes,  though  for  many  years  his  life  must 
have  been  a  continued  struggle  with  hardship  and 
poverty),  that  so  few  will  take  the  true  and  pure  pleasure 
so  freely  offered  to  all,  that  so  few  think  the  study  of 
the  universe  worth  their  attention  or  realise  that  through 
it  they  can  learn  more  fully  the  power,  wisdom,  and 
goodness  of  the  Creator  of  all.  To  him  such  study  was 
a  necessity  of  his  very  nature,  as  well  as  a  privilege 
beyond  price  that  he  would  fain  have  shared  with  all. 
He  held  that  the  whole  world  is  holy  and  God's  message 
is  written  everywhere — a  message  that  he  sought  to  aid 
all  to  interpret ;  but  one  seems  to  hear  from  him  the 
burden,  "  Ye  will  not  come."  The  introduction  to  his 
History  of  the  Molluscous  Animals  of  the  Counties  of 
Aberdeen,  Kincardine,  and  Banff  (a  wonderful  work 
to  be  the  result  of  less  than  two  years'  search)  gives  a 
very  vivid  picture  of  his  keen  desire  to  advance  the 
progress  of  scientific  study,  the  best  interests  of  education, 
and  the  honour  of  his  University.  No  less  does  it  show 
how  he  succeeded  in  enlisting  the  sympathies  of  his 
students  and  his  pleasure  in  acknowledging  their  assist- 
ance. He  speaks  in  it  of  "  the  pleasure  of  continually 
adding  to  one's  knowledge,  the  sympathy  of  friends,  the 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  69 

invigorating  influence  of  the  many  ramblings  required, 
and  the  delight  of  aiding  others  in  the  same  pursuits  " 
as  "amply  sufficient  to  carry  one  through  greater 
difficulties  "  than  he  had  met  with  in  the  preparation  of 
the  book.  He  held  strong  views  as  to  the  claims  of 
natural  science  to  a  place  in  education,  and  the  need 
of  freeing  education  from  "  the  incubus  of  what  would 
smother  the  mind  that,  if  unrestrained,  would  inhale 
with  delight  the  pure  air  of  heaven."  To  him  Nature- 
study  in  schools  would  have  brought  delight  as  the 
promise  of  a  better  state  of  education.  I  think  that  of 
him,  as  of  few  men,  can  be  said — "  Blessed  are  the  pure 
in  heart,  for  they  shall  see  God." 

Professor  J.  Arthur  Thomson  said  —  After  the 
admirable  and  appropriate  words  we  have  heard,  I  find 
it  very  difficult  to  add  anything.  Yet  I  am  glad  to  use 
the  opportunity  kindly  afforded  me,  and  I  wish  to  say 
three  things. 

Without  prejudicing  an  important  question,  may  I 
say  that  just  as  gladly  as  the  Principal  has  received 
this  beautiful  MacGillivray  memorial  on  behalf  of  the 
University,  so  gladly  would  I  in  turn  become  its  sub- 
custodian in  the  Natural  History  Department.  I  venture 
to  hope  that  it  may  not  be  removed  many  yards,  if  pos- 
sible not  many  feet,  from  the  spot  where  we  have  seen  it 
unveiled  by  Dr.  White.  A  memorial  should  be  appro- 
priate and  beautiful — and  this  is  both  ;  but  it  ought  also 
to  be  a  stimulus ;  and  surely  it  is  in  the  precincts  of  this 
class-room  that  its  powers  of  stimulus  should  be  tested. 


70  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

Every  one  in  Britain  who  cares  much  about  birds 
does,  in  a  real  sense,  know  MacGillivray,  for  he  left  a 
lasting  mark  upon  ornithology.  May  I  explain  in  a 
minute  why  one  says  so.  It  is  because,  until  1837,  no 
one  in  Britain  had  seriously  tried  to  found  a  classification, 
or  natural  system  of  birds  except  upon  external  char- 
acters ;  while  MacGillivray — a  trained  anatomist — got 
far  beneath  the  surface  and  showed  that  a  bird  is  not 
always,  nor  altogether,  to  be  known  by  its  feathers.  My 
own  opinion  is  of  little  moment  in  matters  ornithological, 
but  let  me  quote  a  sentence  from  The  Dictionary  of 
Birds,  in  which  Mr.  Alfred  Newton,  rather  an  unsparing- 
critic,  says — "After  Willughby,  MacGillivray  was  the 
greatest  and  most  original  ornithological  genius  save 
one  (who  did  not  live  long  enough  to  make  his  powers 
widely  known)  that  this  island  has  produced."  It  may 
be  that  the  greatest  merit  of  MacGillivray's  "  system  of 
birds"  was  that  it  prompted  a  better  one,  yet  we  are 
here  to-day  respecting  him  because  he  tackled  a  big 
piece  of  work  and  did  it  well. 

But,  as  has  been  said,  there  are  many  other  reasons 
— beyond  all  ornithology — why  we  seek  to  keep  his 
memory  green.  He  was  a  fine  type  of  the  open-air 
naturalist,  before  the  days  of  microtomes  (and  how  he 
pours  scorn  on  the  "  pompous  ornithologist "  who  does 
not  know  what  it  is  to  climb  and  stalk  and  watch) ;  he 
was  a  fine  type  of  the  all-round  naturalist,  holding  to  no 
petty  distinctions  between  this  science  and  that,  realising 
the  unity  of  Nature  and  the  unity  of  Science,  showing, 
for  instance,  in  his  Natural  History  of  Deeside,  that 


PRESENTATION   OF   TABLET  71 

botany  and  zoology,  geology  and  meteorology,  and 
human  history  besides,  were  grist  to  his  scientific  mill ; 
he  was  a  fine  type  of  the  local  naturalist,  as  keen  as 
Dr.  Trail  is  for  regional  surveys,  or  the  study  of  local 
faunas  and  floras,  for  science,  like  charity,  begins  at 
home. 

MacGillivray  had  a  great  interest  in  the  history  of 
natural  history,  and  wrote  an  interesting  book  there- 
upon. It  is  curious  that  one  of  his  successors,  the  late 
Professor  Alleyne  Nicholson,  did  likewise  ;  and  that  yet 
another  has  followed  the  same  fascinating  path.  Some 
one  has  spoken  of  his  independence,  and  of  this  and  of 
his  great  good  humour  there  is  interesting  evidence  in 
a  manuscript  entitled  The  Two  Ornithologists  in  the 
library,  where  he  relates  a  real  or  supposed  quarrel  with 
Audubon,  for  whom  he  apparently  did  more  work  than 
he  ever  got  credit  for.  As  one  looks  at  the  memorial 
one  cannot  help  remembering  that  MacGillivray  was  in 
a  way  an  artist  both  with  pen  and  pencil.  His  style  is 
delightful ;  his  handwriting  must  to  many  of  us  seem 
marvellous.  It  equals  the  memorial  inscription  in  beauty, 
and  excels  it  in  legibility. 

But  I  had  almost  forgotten  the  most  important  thing 
I  have  to  say.  MacGillivray  was  one  of  a  grand  body 
of  workers  who  raised  natural  history  (as  he  says 
without  personal  reference)  from  a  position  of  contempt 
to  the  highest  dignity.  What  was  their  secret  ?  Was 
it  not,  in  part  at  least,  as  MacGillivray  says  somewhere 
else,  that  Nature  always  reveals  herself  to  those  who 
approach  her  with  humility  and  with  affection.

Principal  Lang  said  he  thought  they  had  had  a  very 
profitable,  instructing,  and  stimulating  afternoon,  and 
before  they  parted  he  was  sure  that  they  would  like  to 
express  their  gratitude  to  Dr.  Forbes  White  for  coming 
from  Dundee  and  for  giving  them  his  most  interesting 
and  beautiful  address  upon  Professor  MacGillivray. 

Dr.  White  said  it  had  been  a  very  great  pleasure 
indeed  to  him  to  have  had  any  share  in  that  meeting. 
He  was  extremely  glad,  as  one  of  MacGillivray's  oldest 
pupils,  to  have  had  an  opportunity  of  expressing  his  deep 
debt  of  gratitude  to  him.

EXTRACTS  FROM  A  TRIBUTE  BY  PROFESSOR  MAC- 

GlLLIVRAY     TO     THE     MEMORY     OF     DR.     BARCLAY, 

DATED  TTH  APRIL  1820. 


XI 

My  thoughts  were  gloomy,  and  I  felt  the  wo 
Of  human  kind  press  with  a  leaden  weight 

Upon  my  breast ;  yet  I  could  not  forgo 
For  aught  of  intellect  that  wilder'd  state, 
For  it  had  left  my  heart  reckless  of  fate ; 

And  when  the  light  of  love  flash'd  on  my  soul, 
Oh  !  then  I  felt  of  Rapture's  power  the  height, 

Equal  to  former  gloom,  and  she  was  sole 
Directress  of  my  feelings,  wild  without  control. 


XII 

Enough  of  this — enough  is  said  to  show — 
Not  that  I  am,  forsooth,  a  wondrous  wight 

Who  trod  a  path  apart  from  all  below, 

And  in  the  storm  and  lightning  had  delight, 

The  whirlwind's  rage,  and  deepest  gloom  of  night ; 


74  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

But  that  the  name  which  hallows  this  rude  song 

Has  been  to  me  a  blessing  and  a  light 
To  guide  me  on  my  weary  way  along, 
And  lead  to  shady  groves,  their  flowers  to  rest  among. 

XIII 

A  shipwreck'd  mariner  upon  the  sea 

Of  thought,  scarce  'scap'd  from  the  o'erwhelming 

wave, 
That  roll'd  its  mighty  mass  in  frantic  glee 

Along  perdition's  gulf — scarce  'scap'd  this  grave, 

I  found  me  dash'd,  and  none  at  hand  to  save, 
On  Doubt's  dark  slippery  rocks  :  he  saw  my  state, 

And  brought  relief ;  and  though  I  might  not  brave, 
As  I  had  done,  the  wrathful  scowl  of  Fate, 
He  cheer'd  my  soul,  and  rais'd  my  drooping  head  elate. 

XIV 

Friend  to  the  friendless,  he  was  all  to  me 

That  my  fond  heart  could  wish  ;   and  though  no 

more 

His  friendly  smile  may  wake  my  bosom's  glee, 
Yet  shall  his  memory  live  within  its  core, 
Unchang'd,    'mid    feeling's    change,   the    love    I 

bore : — 
For  what  is  death,  that  it  should  rase  the  name 

Which  fond  affection  teaches  to  adore  ? 
'Tis  but  the  change  of  being,  and  the  same 
Kind  feeling  which  we  bore  still  urges  its  strong  claim. 


TRIBUTE  TO  DR.  BARCLAY  75

He  saw  my  follies,  and  reprov'd  them  oft : 
Not  in  the  galling  tone  of  sullen  speech, 

But  as  a  friend,  in  accents  firm  though  soft, 
Moulded  alike  to  cherish  and  to  teach, 
Seeming  than  order  rather  to  beseech. 

My  guide  in  Learning's  arduous  path,  he  cheer'd 
My  drooping  spirits ;  then,  as  I  would  reach 

Each  little  stage,  and  still  a  new  appear'd, 
Though   hard   the   task,    'twas   by  his  care   and   love 
endear'd. 

XVI 

The  magic  world  which  I  had  fondly  made, 
Each  fancy-hammer'd  link  of  that  frail  chain 

Which  comprehended  all,  living  and  dead, 
Spiritual  and  of  matter,  of  the  brain 
The  misty  mould,  incongruous  and  vain, 

He  knew  and  smil'd  :  he  smil'd  perchance  to  see 
How  the  fantastic  wreath  the  luckless  swain 

With  patient  labour  fram'd  and  cheering  glee, 
Which  ne'er  with  sober  Reason's  precepts  might  agree. 


XVII 

But  his,  though  'twas  the  smile  of  irony, 
Had  nought  of  malice  :  universal  love 
And  mild  benevolence  beam'd  from  his  eye ; 


76  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

And  his  the  feeling  heart  each  pang  could  move 
That  human  nature  knew  ;  "  gentle  as  dove, 
As  serpent  wise."     If  innocence  might  e'er 

Be  join'd  to  knowledge  elsewhere  than  above, 
The  union  in  his  soul  might  well  appear, 
O'er  whose  untimely  fate  I  drop  th'  unbidden  tear. 


XVIII 

Friend  of  my  heart !  who  that  e'er  knew  thy  worth 
Could  hear  unmov'd  the  melancholy  tale  ? 

There  breathes  not  on  this  dark  and  dreary  earth 
A  human  being  whom  I  love  so  well — 
Save  one1 — and  she,  perchance,  may  sadly  dwell 

On  thy  lamented  doom. — We  scarcely  know 
How  dear  our  friends,  till  the  convulsive  swell 

Which  heaves  the  throbbing  bosom  sadly  show 
That  he  for  whom  it  rises  mingled  with  its  glow. 

1  This  requires  explanation.  Having  his  mind  entirely  occupied 
with  the  idea  of  his  departed  friend,  the  author,  at  the  time  of  com- 
posing this  stanza,  thought  and  felt  that  none  could  be  dearer  to  his 
heart.  This,  however,  it  will  readily  be  perceived,  was  rather  a  hallu- 
cination produced  by  feeling,  than  the  result  of  a  strict  investigation 
of  his  affections.  There  are  several  whom  he  loves  as  well ;  but  few 
whom  he  loves  more.  There  are  no  other  passages  which  require 
explanation  or  modification  to  show  that  they  are  legitimate.  This 
explanation  is  made,  not  for  the  purpose  of  showing  the  author's  regard 
to  truth :  for  opinion  and  appearances,  he  thinks,  he  can  treat  with 
great  contempt  and  disregard;  but  to  prevent  the  possibility  of 
fancying  that  exaggerations  have  been  used  in  describing  the  character 
of  his  friend. 


TRIBUTE  TO  DR.  BARCLAY  77 

XIX 

Friend  of  my  heart !  hast  thou  for  ever  fled  ? 

Ah  !  fondly  could  my  swelling  heart  believe 
That  he  who  now  is  number'd  with  the  dead, 

For  whose  harsh  doom,  though  that  of  Heaven,  I 
grieve, 

Yet  breath'd  :  but  hope  no  longer  may  deceive  ; 
And  slowly  mouldering  in  the  silent  earth, 

The  prey  of  death,  now  chill'd  beyond  reprieve, 
Is  that  once  glowing  breast  of  truth  and  worth, 
Which  sympathis'd  with  sorrow,  join'd  in  social  mirth. 


xx 

Calm  and  compos'd,  no  passion's  fiery  sway 
Left  its  deep  furrows  on  his  beaming  face ; 

Grave  without  gloom,  and  innocently  gay, 

The  smile  upon  his  dimpling  cheek  would  chase 
The  frown  of  wisdom  ;  and  although  the  trace 

Of  thought  upon  his  placid  brow  was  seen, 

No  harshness  with  it  mix'd,  but  from  the  grace 

Which  beam'd  in  every  feature  you  might  glean 
Knowledge  of  mind  array 'd  in  virtue's  dazzling  sheen. 

XXI 

Rich  were  the  treasures  of  his  cultur'd  mind ; 

For  Learning  there  her  various  stores  had  pil'd, 
Glean'd  from  each  mine  of  thought,  drossless,  refin'd, 


78  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

Select  and  pure,  o'er  which  even  virtue  smil'd. 

Unlike  the  puffing  pedant,  he  was  mild  ; 
And,  conscious  of  his  worth,  he  spurn'd  the  glare 

Which  flippant  Folly  beams  upon  her  child  ; 
The  sceptic  scorner's  chair  he  would  not  share, 
For  virtue  and  religion  claim'd  his  constant  care. 

XXII 

Social  affection  glow'd  for  all  mankind 

Within  that  guileless  breast ;  and  o'er  his  cheek 

And  in  his  eye  beam'd  sympathy  refin'd, 

Seeming,  without  the  aid  of  speech,  to  speak 
A  soul  all  gentleness,  holy  and  meek ; 

And  that  diffusive  love,  thus  clearly  known, 
Concentrated,  when  he  would  fondly  seek 

The  charm  of  happiness  among  his  own, 
The  kindred  souls  who  shar'd  his  heart,  intensely  shone. 

XXIII 

Ah  !  little  know'st  thou,  darling  of  his  love  ! 

Who  oft  hast  met  his  fond  parental  smile 
With  infant  glee,  which  every  smile  could  move, 

And  climb'd  with  panting  haste  his  knee  the  while, 

That  he  whose  sorrows  thou  didst  oft  beguile, 
The  other  source  of  all  thy  infant  joy, 

Who  woke  thy  mirth  with  many  a  parent's  wile, 
Shall  never  guide  the  footsteps  of  his  boy, 
Nor  on  his  youthful  mind  his  anxious  cares  employ. 


TRIBUTE  TO  DR.  BARCLAY  79 


XXIV 

Yet  may  the  image  of  thy  father's  face, 

By  Memory's  pencil  dash'd  upon  thy  heart, 
In  other  years,  when  thou  shalt  fondly  trace 

Each  lineament,  the  joy  of  grief  impart ; 

And  on  the  wings  of  Fancy  thou  shalt  dart, 
Beyond  the  farthest  gleam  of  earthly  ray, 

To  yonder  mansions  of  the  blest ; — then  start 
To  find  thee  guideless  on  life's  wildering  way, 
And  call  upon  the  God  who  is  the  orphan's  stay. 


xxv 


Alas,  for  her  whom  he  has  left  behind  ! 

What  language  may  be  found  to  speak  her  wo 
To  paint  the  anguish  of  her  wilder'd  mind, 

Writhing  in  agony  beneath  the  blow 

Of  fate,  which  she  was  doom'd  to  undergo  ? 
No,  not  the  eagle  eye  of  thought  can  pry 

Into  that  bleeding  bosom's  core  to  show 
Its  chaos  of  despair,  since  burst  the  tie 
On  which  all  hopes  of  earth-born  happiness  rely. 


80  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 


A  COPY  of  the  following  Lines  having  been  found  in  DR.  BARCLAY'S 
desk  after  his  death,  his  friends  have  expressed  a  wish  to  have 
them  printed,  on  account  of  the  simile  contained  in  them.  For 
this  reason,  and  not  for  any  supposed  intrinsic  merit,  they  are 
subjoined  ;  and  with  the  more  propriety,  that  they  were  composed 
by  the  author  of  the  foregoing  pages.  They  form  part  of  an 
unfinished  poem ;  and  were  suggested  by  a  midnight  walk  on  a 
sandy  beach  of  one  of  the  remote  Hebrides. 

The  midnight  hour, 

Solemn  and  still,  but  placid  and  serene  ; 
Calm  as  the  pale  and  lovely  face  of  Virtue, 
When  the  glad  spirit  meditates  her  flight 
From  her  material  mansion,  and  the  voice 
Of  Hope  pours  on  the  ear  the  melody  of  Heaven — 
The  smooth  expanse  of  ocean,  when  the  wind, 
Wearied  with  blustering,  sleeps  upon  its  bosom  ; 
The  ripple  of  the  wavelet  on  the  shore, 
Scarce  loud  enough  to  break  the  calm  profound  ; 
The  dim-discover'd  mountains  of  the  east, 
That  overhang,  in  soften'd  majesty, 
The  deep — oh  !  these  have  charms  that  well  might  woo 
The  contemplative  mind  to  Midnight's  bower.

JOURNAL  OF  A  VISIT  TO  MUSEUMS  IN  GLASGOW, 
LIVERPOOL,  DUBLIN,  BRISTOL,  AND  LONDON  BY 
PROFESSOR  MACGILLIVRAY  IN  1833. 

GLASGOW,  BLACK  BULL  INN, 

Wednesday,  4&lt;tk  September  1833. 

HAVING  been  ordered  by  the  Royal  College  of  Surgeons 
of  Edinburgh  to  proceed  to  London,  for  the  purpose  of 
inspecting  the  anatomical,  physiological,  and  patho- 
logical museums  there,  I  left  the  metropolis  of  Scot- 
land at  nine  this  morning,  and  after  sitting  four  and  a 
half  hours  on  the  top  of  a  coach,  arrived  at  Glasgow,  the 
second  city  of  that  ancient  kingdom.  Finding  myself 
somewhat  benumbed  by  the  cold,  I  took  a  stroll  along 
the  streets,  and  coming  accidentally  upon  a  large  sand- 
stone quarry,  examined  it  more  geologorum. 

•  .  •  •  • 

A  little  after  three  I  went  to  the  College  for  the 
purpose  of  visiting  the  Museum  ;  but  after  ringing  and 
rapping  for  a  considerable  time  at  the  door  of  the  latter, 
was  obliged  to  retrace  my  steps,  when  I  learned  that 
the  keeper  admitted  no  person  after  three.  Here  then 
is  my  first  lesson  in  the  matter  of  museums,  namely,  to

admit  no  visitors  after  the  hour  of  shutting  ;  for  a  like 
reason,  none  before  the  regular  hour  of  opening,  and  a 
fortiori  none  on  shut  days !  Glasgow,  however,  must 
not  have  the  honour  of  dictating  to  Edinburgh  ;  and  no 
man  ought  to  follow  an  evil  example. 

In  the  afternoon  I  crossed  the  Clyde  by  one  of  the 
bridges,  walked  out  into  the  country,  observed  that  oat 
stooks  are  composed  of  twelve  sheaves,  wheat  ones  of 
fourteen ;  looked  at  everything,  especially  the  ladies, 
who  were  all  desperately  ugly ;  recrossed  the  river, 
counted  the  steamers,  and  seeing  some  persons  un- 
shipping a  cargo  of  limestone,  took  a  specimen  ;  traversed 
the  city,  walked  into  the  Exchange,  which  to  my  taste 
is  superior  to  any  building  in  Edinburgh ;  returned  to 
the  Black  Bull,  took  tea,  read  newspapers,  and  finally 
arrived  at  my  bedroom. 

On  the  way  from  Edinburgh  to  Glasgow  I  saw  that 
the  whole  district  consists  of  the  coal  formation,  singu- 
larly broken  up  the  greater  part  of  the  way  by  trap 
rocks,  which  consist  in  general  of  a  dark  blue  greenstone  ! 
Between  Upton  Hall  and  Bathgate  these  trap  rocks 
form  remarkable  hummocks  or  rounded  prominences, 
the  examination  of  which  would  probably  be  interesting. 
In  the  greater  part  of  the  route  the  walls  are  of  green- 
stone, as  are  most  of  the  houses  ;  but  towards  Airdrie, 
and  from  that  to  Glasgow,  they  are  of  sandstone  of 
various  tints  and  textures,  very  seldom  red,  however. 
In  the  city  itself  the  houses  are  of  sandstone,  which  is 
generally  very  much  inferior  to  that  of  Edinburgh  in 
colour  and  quality,  but  still  sufficiently  good. 


JOURNAL  83 

Glasgow  seems  an  immense  receptacle  of  goods  and 
provisions.  I  went  out  to  look  for  a  bookseller,  and 
with  difficulty  found  one — shop  after  shop  interminably 
—cheese,  butter,  hams,  hardware,  tallow,  haberdashery, 
drinkables,  eatables,  putonables,  smokeables,  snuffables, 
and  a  profusion  of  abominables,  but,  it  would  seem, 
very  few  readables,  excepting  bills  respecting  merchan- 
dise and  steam  navigation.  However,  it  is  a  fine  city, 
and  doubtless  as  full  of  wickedness  as  fine  cities 
usually  are. 

STEAM- YACHT  "AiLSA  CRAIG," 

ON  THE  CLYDE  SOMEWHERE  BELOW  GREENOCK, 

Thursday,  5th  September  1833. 

Between  nine  and  ten  in  the  morning  I  called  on 
Dr.  Hannay,  to  whom  I  had  a  letter  of  introduction 
from  Dr.  William  Thomson,  and  who  engaged  to  meet 
me  at  the  Andersonian  Institution  at  one  o'clock.  I 
then  proceeded  to  the  College,  whence  I  was,  however, 
obliged  to  return,  the  Museum  not  being  open.  So  I 
had  recourse  to  Nature,  as  I  often  have  had  under  more 
grievous  disappointments,  and  betook  myself  to  the 
margin  of  the  city,  where  I  observed,  opposite  to  St. 
Mungo's  Church,  a  monument-crowded  eminence,  the 
inspection  of  which  promised  amusement,  if  not  profit. 
The  little  valley  or  hollow  at  its  base  showed  strata  of 
sandstone  precisely  similar  to  those  described  as  having 
been  seen  yesterday.  The  hill  itself  is  to  be  laid  out  as 
a  burial  ground,  and  is  named  the  New  Cemetery  or 
Necropolis.  On  ascending  I  was  somewhat  surprised  to 
find  it  composed,  excepting  at  the  western  base,  of  a 


84  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

rather  large  -  grained  greenstone,  having  dark  green 
hornblende  and  reddish  felspar  as  its  components.  On 
the  south-eastern  side  is  a  very  large  quarry,  which  I 
afterwards  visited. 

The  monument  on  the  summit  of  this  hill,  which 
was  formerly  named  the  Fir  Park,  is  a  statue  of 
John  Knox  elevated  on  a  Doric  column.  The  pedestal 
bears  the  following  inscription  : — 

To  testify  gratitude  for  inestimable  services  in 
the  cause  of  religion,  education  and  civil  liberty 

To  awaken  admiration 
of  that  integrity,  disinterestedness  and  courage 

Which  stood  unshaken  in  the  midst  of  trials 
And  in  the  maintenance  of  the  highest  objects 

Finally 
To  cherish  unceasing  reverence  for  the  principles  and 

Blessings  of  that  great  Reformation 
By  the  influence  of  which  our  country,  through  the  midst  of 

difficulties 

Has  risen  to  honour,  prosperity,  and  happiness 

This  monument  is  erected  by  voluntary  contribution 

To  the  memory  of 

JOHN  KNOX

of  the  Reformation  of  Scotland 

On  the  XXII  day  of  September  MDCCCXXX

the  world  judge  which  of  the  cities  has  displayed  most 
judgment  and  good  taste. 

Charles  II.  John  Knox. 

George  IV.  Watt. 

Lord  Melville.  Sir  John  Moore. 

Burns.  William  III. 

At  twelve  I  at  length  obtained  admission  to  the 
College  Museum. 

In  the  front  room  are  several  stuffed  skins  of 
quadrupeds :  a  camelopard  of  rather  small  size,  a 
zebra,  a  hyena,  several  species  of  deer  and  antelope, 
a  lion  and  lioness,  etc.,  most  of  them  very  ill-prepared, 
and  in  bad  attitudes,  with  clumsy  ununiform  pedestals. 
They  are,  however,  kept  very  clean,  and  have  in 
general  been  good  specimens.  There  are  four  recesses 
in  the  walls,  filled  with  foreign  birds  and  insects,  ill- 
prepared  and  whimsically  disposed. 

In  the  room  to  the  right  are  coins,  medals,  snakes, 
quadrupeds,  all  without  order. 

A  collection  of  British  birds,  very  clean  and  neat, 
but  generally  in  bad  attitudes.  The  beaks  of  two 
eagles  were  actually  polished  and  varnished,  and  the 
legs  and  bills  in  general  were  painted,  usually  of  tints  un- 
like those  of  the  parts  in  their  natural  state.  The  legs 
of  birds  ought  never  to  be  painted  for  obvious  reasons. 

Minerals. — A  very  large  and  fine  piece  of  Labrador 
felspar,  polished. 

Left-hand  room :  birds  and  quadrupeds,  fresh  and 
in  good  condition,  but  generally  ill-stuffed. 


86  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

The  whole  Museum  is  more  disposed  for  show  than 
use,  and  the  most  egregious  want  of  method  is  per- 
ceptible in  all  the  rooms — I  mean  scientific  method ; 
for  the  articles  are  well  disposed  for  effect  and  the 
whole  place  has  a  rich  and  finished  look,  the  furniture 
and  materials  being  good,  and  in  sufficient  quantity. 

On  the  whole,  I  am  much  pleased  with  the  Glasgow 
collection,  but  the  materials,  which  are  good,  might  be 
better  arranged,  and  a  great  error  common  to  most 
collections  is  that  all  sorts  of  things  are  gathered,  and 
that  they  are  laid  out  for  show  and  not  for  use. 

Dr.  Hannay  could  not  meet  me  at  the  Andersonian 
Institution,  but  sent  a  young  gentleman,  whom  I 
found  exceedingly  obliging  and  polite,  and  who  intro- 
duced me  to  Mr.  Scoular,  who  is  a  keen  zoologist. 
The  collection  there  is  contained  in  a  large  circular 
dome-roofed  apartment,  well  lighted,  and  having  a 
gallery.  It  consists  of  fragments  of  everything  under 
the  moon  : — rocks,  minerals,  skeletons,  fossils,  skulls, 
stuffed  quadrupeds,  birds  and  fishes,  reptiles  in  spirits, 
coins,  antique  pottery,  plaster  casts,  human  crania, 
skeletons  of  mammalia,  etc. 

The  skeletons  are  horrible.  There  is  one  of  a  small 
elephant  out  of  all  proportion — all  the  rest  are  bad. 
All  the  birds  and  quadrupeds  and  fishes  are  ill-stuffed 
—yea,  every  one  of  them — at  least  I  did  not  see  one 
that  was  good.  They  are  ill -arranged  too.  The 
people  here  may  have  science,  for  anything  that  I 


JOURNAL  87 

know  to  the  contrary,  but  they  have  no  taste,  no,  not 
a  particle.  A  dome  is  not  a  good  place  for  a  museum. 
Galleries  are  better.  Nothing  can  be  got  to  fill  up  the 
central  space,  unless  one  should  erect  a  pyramid  of 
elephants,  megatheria,  giraffes,  and  crocodiles. 

There  are  materials  for  a  good  display,  however. 
The  zoological  specimens  are  excellent,  the  minerals 
tolerable,  the  shells  poor. 

Dr.  Hannay's  friend  then  took  me  to  the  small 
room  containing  Dr.  Hunter's  anatomical  and  patho- 
logical collection — filth,  dirt,  and  abomination ;  a  few 
skeletons  of  quadrupeds,  some  skulls,  and  two  or  three 
hundred  preparations  in  bottles,  all  disgustingly  dirty 
and  disorderly.  A  young  Hibernian  showed  the 
wonders,  himself  not  the  least,  yet  a  good  sort  of  a  lad, 
and  smartly  attired.  I  hope  I  shall  not  see  many 
collections  like  them,  otherwise  I  shall  renounce  the 
calling,  and  betake  myself  to  geognosy,  where,  if  there 
be  confusion,  it  is  confusion  with  design,  or  to  botany, 
where  all  is  beauty. 

LIVERPOOL  HARBOUR,  "AILSA  CRAIG," 
Friday,  Saturday,  September,  1  A.M. 

We  arrived  here  ten  minutes  ago.  When  I  got  up 
in  the  morning  we  were  off  Portpatrick.  The  land  to 
the  Mull  of  Galloway  was  rather  low,  bare,  and  un- 
interesting. The  rocks  along  the  water  apparently 
granite  along  the  whole  coast. 

From  Air  Point  to  Ramsay  in  the  Isle  of  Man  the 
land  low  and  sandy.  The  banks  vary  in  height  to  80  or 


88  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

100  feet,  the  highest  eminence  about  150.  The  highest 
mountain  of  the  range,  forming  the  elevated  ground  of 
the  island,  seems  to  be  about  2000  feet  high.  I  imagine 
it  to  be  composed  of  slate.  To  the  next  point  the 
rocks  along  the  shore  are  of  slate,  probably  clay  slate. 

ANGEL  INN,  CASTLE  STREET, 
LIVERPOOL,  Saturday. 

I  left  Glasgow  by  the  "  Ailsa  Craig  "  steam-yacht  at 
half-past  four  on  Thursday.  At  Greenock  some  goods 
were  to  be  taken  in,  and  in  the  meantime  I  visited  Dr. 
Turner  and  my  old  friend  his  wife.  The  evening 
passed  right  merrily  on  the  Clyde,  and  at  six  in  the 
morning,  when  we  emerged  from  our  dormitories,  we 
found  ourselves  opposite  Portpatrick.  The  sun  shone 
gloriously  all  day  ;  the  sea  was  so  smooth  that  it  almost 
resembled  the  face  of  a  plate  of  glass.  When  we 
reached  the  coast  of  Man,  there  was  not  a  ripple  on 
it,  a  circumstance  which  the  captain  remarked  he  had 
never  seen  before.  The  sun  set  gloriously,  like  a  ball 
of  fire,  and  in  due  time  we  had  a  clear  firmament 
studded  with  stars.  Jupiter  blazed  in  the  south-east,  and 
the  moon  rose  red  like  a  volcanic  fire  over  the  Lanca- 
shire land,  while  the  water,  agitated  by  the  paddles  of 
the  vessel,  flashed  and  sparkled  with  phosphoric  light. 
As  we  approached  the  mouth  of  the  Mersey  we  passed 
a  multitude  of  vessels,  and  took  on  board  a  pilot.  The 
lights  blazed  over  the  smooth  waters  like  meteors,  and 
by  their  guidance  we  arrived  in  one  of  the  docks  at  one 
this  morning.  At  two  I  went  to  bed,  and  at  six  got  up 


JOURNAL  89 

again ;  but  a  drowsy  man  must  necessarily  be  a  dull 
writer,  and  so  I  proceed  to  extract  my  carcase  from  its 
investiture. 


DUBLIN,  Tuesday,  10th  September  1833. 

On  Saturday  I  visited  various  parts  of  Liverpool, 
examined  the  docks  and  the  geology  of  the  neighbour- 
hood, and,  finding  myself  near  the  railway  station,  went 
to  it  and  took  a  seat  for  Manchester  at  twelve.  We 
arrived  there  at  half-past  two,  after  numerous  stoppages 
by  the  way,  for  the  purpose  of  discharging  and  taking 
in  passengers.  At  Manchester  I  remained  only  half  an 
hour,  in  the  course  of  which  I  merely  observed  that  the 
country  belonged  to  the  coal  formation  and  new  red 
sandstone,  which  is  also  the  case  along  the  whole  of  the 
railway.  The  journey  back  to  Liverpool  was  performed 
in  an  hour  and  a  half.  Fine  sections  of  the  new  red 
stone  are  presented  along  the  course  of  the  railway ; 
and  there  are  numerous  quarries  about  Liverpool  of  the 
same  formation. 

On  Sunday  I  heard  a  very  excellent  sermon  in  one 
of  the  chapels  of  the  Wesleyan  Methodists,  and  walked 
over  a  great  portion  of  the  western  district  of  the  town. 
The  streets  are  generally  narrow,  and  very  irregularly 
planned  ;  the  houses  of  brick,  and  by  no  means  remark- 
able for  beauty.  Most  of  the  churches  are  of  sandstone, 
red  or  grey,  but  several  are  of  brick.  As  to  these 
matters,  however,  they  may  be  seen  in  the  Stranger  in 
Liverpool  and  elsewhere. 


90  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

On  Monday  before  ten  I  called  on  Dr.  Mackintyre, 
to  whom  I  had  a  letter  from  Dr.  W.  Thomson,  and  who 
gave  me  an  order  for  the  Zoological  Gardens.  He  in- 
formed me  that  there  are  no  anatomical  or  pathological 
collections  in  Liverpool,  and  that,  being  engaged,  he 
could  not  at  present  accompany  me  anywhere.  So  I  went 
to  the  Royal  Institution,  where  I  met  with  Dr.  Murray 
and  his  brother,  the  former  being  engaged  in  delivering 
a  course  of  lectures  on  geology.  These  gentlemen, 
with  great  kindness,  showed  me  the  Museum,  which  is 
contained  in  a  singularly  ill-disposed  suite  of  apartments. 
The  disposition,  however,  is  worse  as  to  effect  than  as  to 
the  distribution  of  the  articles.  There  is  an  extensive 
collection  of  rocks  and  minerals,  generally  pretty  good, 
the  former  deficient  in  character  and  uniformity.  They 
are  placed  in  square  trays  or  boxes  and  are  arranged  in 
glazed  tables,  but  they  are  by  no  means  neatly  disposed. 
The  fossils  are  numerous  and  generally  good.  Quad- 
rupeds, ill-stuffed — birds,  wretched.  There  is  not  one 
specimen  in  a  characteristic  attitude,  but  they  are  pretty 
numerous.  A  painting  by  Audubon  of  the  wild  turkey, 
good.  A  portrait  of  Dr.  Traill,  not  more  like  than  it 
should  be.  Ancient  paintings  from  Roscoe's  collection  ; 
cast  of  antique  statues  ;  Ognia  and  Elgin  marbles. 

I  am  of  opinion  that  the  College  of  Surgeons  of 
Edinburgh  ought  by  all  means  to  obtain  casts  of  the 
Apollo  Belvidere,  Diana,  Venus  de  Medicis,  and  a  few 
others  as  specimens  of  the  perfect  form  of  the  human 
body.  There  are  a  few  Florentine  wax  casts  ;  a  con- 
siderable collection  of  skeletons  and  skulls  of  mammalia 


JOURNAL  91 

and  birds,  fine  corals,  shells,  etc.  This,  as  usual,  is  an 
omnium  gatherum  museum.  I  say  decidedly  that 
everything  is  ill-arranged,  the  cases  ill- constructed,  the 
ticketing  bad. 

I  then  walked  to  the  Zoological  Gardens,  which, 
although  not  extensive,  are  very  prettily  arrayed ;  and 
this  kind  of  museum  is  assuredly  much  superior  in  every 
respect  to  a  collection  of  stuffed  animals — not  that  the 
latter  can  be  dispensed  with  either. 

At  six  left  Liverpool  by  the  Commerce  Steam  Packet 
for  Dublin.  The  cabin  passengers  were  in  general  of  a 
cast  much  inferior  to  those  of  the  "  Ailsa  Craig."  The 
latter  had  an  exceUent  library  consisting  of  fifty  or  sixty 
volumes,  including  two  Bibles.  The  former  had  only  a 
volume  of  the  Spectator.,  with  cards  and  a  backgammon 
table.  The  accommodation  inferior,  as  well  as  everything 
else.  The  deck  crowded  with  ragged  Hibernians  of  both 
sexes,  returning  from  the  harvest.  The  weather  was 
beautiful  until  twelve  at  night,  when  we  were  off  the 
Point  of  Anglesey,  and  when  I  retired  to  my  berth — 
Jupiter,  numberless  stars,  aurora  borealis,  phosphorescent 
sea,  etc.,  ships  sailing  towards  the  Mersey.  There  was 
a  breeze  and  a  good  deal  of  rain  after  this.  We  landed 
at  half-past  ten  at  Kingstown,  seven  miles  from  Dublin, 
and  I  arrived  at  the  latter  city  in  a  filthy  car  driven  by 
a  ragged  and  blackguard-looking  Irishman. 

The  country  about  Kingstown  is  of  granite,  of  which 
great  quantities  were  lying  at  the  harbour  for  exportation. 
The  splendid  public  edifices  at  Dublin  are  of  the  same 


92  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

material,  but  most  of  the  private  houses  are  of  brick. 
The  buildings  and  streets  are  much  superior  to  those  of 
Liverpool,  and  the  Bank,  University,  and  other  places  are 
magnificent ;  the  streets,  however,  are  not  very  cleanly, 
nor  are  the  roads  at  all  good,  and  the  lower  orders  of  the 
people  are  villainous  in  aspect,  and  disgustingly  filthy 
and  ragged. 

I  arrived  in  Dublin  about  twelve,  and  after  taking  a 
cup  of  coffee  proceeded  to  the  College,  and  thereafter 
to  the  College  of  Surgeons,  where  I  found  Dr.  Houston, 
Conservator  of  the  Museum. 

The  building  is  splendid,  and  has  a  fine  situation  in 
Stephen's  Green. 

The  hall  is  a  fine  room,  with  an  arched  roof,  of  an 
oblong  form. 

The  hall  of  the  Museum  is  about  ninety  feet  long 
and  forty -five  feet  broad — that  is  by  estimate.  It  is 
lighted  solely  from  the  roof,  and  has  a  gallery  all  round. 
The  space  below  the  gallery,  which  is  too  broad,  is  very 
dark.  The  skeletons  are  arranged  in  glass  boxes  or  cases, 
on  the  floor,  and  on  shelves,  under  the  gallery,  the 
central  part  of  the  floor  being  unoccupied  save  by  a 
miserable  glazed  table,  containing  skulls  and  calculi. 
There  is  a  considerable  number  of  skeletons,  but  almost 
all  most  uningeniously  articulated,  and  in  the  most 
preposterous  attitudes.  About  six  are  excellent,  how- 
ever, viz.  a  horse,  an  alpaca,  a  nylghau,  a  lion,  and  one 
or  two  more  skeletons  of  grampus,  good.  In  this 
department  almost  everything  is  in  the  most  wretched 
disorder. 


JOURNAL  93 

Fine  skeleton  of  boa  and  pike  ;  a  few  tolerable  corals  ; 
three  very  fine  human  skeletons  —  male  and  female 
European  and  male  negro. 

•  •  *  •  • 

The  preparations  are  on  the  whole  pretty  well  put 
up ;  but  there  is  a  most  decided  want  of  taste  in  the 
distribution  of  the  articles,  which,  however,  are  placed  in 
good  order  as  to  their  nature — but  science  and  taste 
must  go  together  in  museums. 

It  is  a  fine  light  room  ;  but  for  a  museum  decidedly 
inferior  to  that  of  the  Edinburgh  College — excepting  in 
respect  to  light. 

Things  in  general  very  dirty.  Dr.  Houston  scolding 
his  assistant — but  in  fact  the  place  is  not  yet  arranged. 

Fine  fossil  horns  and  bones  of  the  Irish  elk  among 
rubbish,  in  a  lumber  room  ! 

Dr.  Houston  says  the  members  of  the  Edinburgh 
College  of  Surgeons  are  continually  praising  their 
museum,  but  for  his  part  he  leaves  to  strangers  the 
praise  which  the  Dublin  Museum  deserves.  All  I 
could  say  in  its  praise  I  said,  namely  that  the  apartment 
is  light  and  elegant. 

Dublin  after  all  is  a  splendid  city.  The  Irish  dialect 
is  detestable — to  my  ear.  The  people  have  a  peculiar 
aspect,  physically  and  morally  bad.  The  lower  orders 
have  a  decided  taste  for  ragged  great  coats. 

Wednesday,  llth  September  1833. 

Went  to  Dr.  Houston's  at  eight,  to  breakfast.  Met 
Dr.  Evanson,  a  very  pleasant  person,  who  asked  me  the 


94  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

name  of  a  plant  which  some  one  had  recommended  as  a 
diuretic.  It  was  Polygonum  aviculare.  I  told  him  the 
whole  family  to  which  it  belongs  is  astringent.  About 
ten  I  accompanied  Dr.  Houston  to  a  Surgical  Hospital, 
and  afterwards  strolled  through  the  city,  taking  care  to 
visit  the  filthiest  parts,  which,  on  the  whole,  are  not 
nearly  so  bad  as  I  expected  to  find  them. 

At  two  I  visited  Dr.  Evanson,  who  drove  me  out  in 
his  car,  along  with  a  friend,  to  the  Phoenix  Park,  the 
Zoological  Gardens,  and  a  limestone  quarry  about  four 
miles  out  of  town.  The  gardens  are  of  considerable 
extent  and  in  a  good  position,  being  on  rather  high 
ground,  with  an  adjoining  hollow  and  pond  fringed 
with  Typha  minor  and  other  plants.  They  are  laid 
out  with  much  less  taste  than  the  Liverpool  animals, 
and  contain  a  smaller  number  of  species.  The 
collection,  however,  is  good,  and  infinitely  superior 
to  a  museum  of  five  times  the  number.  These 
collections  will  in  time  teach  zoological  painters  the 
characteristic  attitudes  of  animals,  of  which  Audubon 
and  myself  are  the  only  persons  who  have  succeeded 
in  attempting  to  afford  an  idea,  in  so  far  as  regards 
birds.  As  to  stuffed  animals,  they  are  altogether, 
entirely,  and  wholly  absurd.  I  have  not  seen  ten 
quadrupeds  nor  five  hundred  birds  that  were  even 
tolerable.  It  is  a  difficult  task  to  put  up  a  skeleton 
of  a  quadruped,  and  still  more  to  stuff  the  skin  of  one. 
Fools,  who  do  not  know  the  difficulty,  readily  find 
faults  with  the  performance,  and  often  see  faults  where 


JOURNAL  95 

there  are  none.  The  quadruped  skeletons  of  the 
Edinburgh  College  of  Surgeons  are  on  the  whole  well 
put  up,  but  hardly  one  of  them  is  perfect.  The  lioness 
is  good  —  so  is  the  elephant  —  and  so  are  several 
others.  Altogether  they  are  a  hundred  times  better 
than  those  of  the  Glasgow  College,  the  Andersonian 
Institution,  the  Liverpool  Institution,  and  the  Dublin 
College  of  Surgeons.  So  far  good.  But  if  the  Edin- 
burgh collection  were  mine,  and  I  had  hands  enough, 
and  money  enough  to  set  them  agoing,  I  could  make 
it  worthy  of  the  nineteenth  century.  One  of  the 
members  told  me  that  the  placing  of  bottles  on  a  shelf 
is  nothing.  Truly,  old  one !  any  person  with  but  one 
eye  might  discover  that,  although  it  is  not  everything, 
it  is  yet  something  which  may  be  desperately  mis- 
managed. 

Museums  with  too  many  managers  must  be  mis- 
managed. Who  ever  heard  of  any  great  exploit 
emanating  from  ten  heads,  although  ten  thousand 
hands  may  have  executed  it.  Did  a  journal  with  two 
editors  ever  prosper  ?  Could  two  Audubons  have  drawn 
the  "Birds  of  America."  If  the  ordination  of  the 
Museum  should  go  contrary  to  my  ideas,  let  it  go  to — 
the  condition  in  which  it  was  when  I  received  it.  I 
never  seriously  desired  the  appointment,  never  called 
on  a  member  for  his  vote,  did  not  even  inquire  when 
the  election  was  to  be,  and  do  not  now  know  who 
voted  for  or  against  me.  Having  undertaken  the 
task,  however,  I  am  now  interested  in  it ;  but,  my 
boys,  thwart  a  little,  and  you  shall  see  that  I  can 


96  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

do  without  you,  just  as  well  as  you  can  do  with- 
out me. 

But,  more  seriously,  I  have  never  been  so  happy 
in  any  office,  and  that  just  because  I  have  found  the 
members  gentlemanly,  considerate,  and  kind — with  few 
exceptions — two  individuals  only — and  of  these  only 
one  hollow.  However,  hollow  or  whole,  no  matter.  I 
thank  God  that  I  am  what  I  am ;  that  although  I 
have,  and  have  good  reason  to  have,  a  very  low 
opinion  of  myself,  I  have  yet  been  endowed  with 
faculties  the  exercise  of  which  will  enable  me,  with 
the  guidance  and  protection  of  God,  to  procure  a 
proper  share  of  the  things  that  belong  to  this  life. 
As  to  the  next,  I  have  confidence  in  God,  that,  having 
begun,  He  will  accomplish. 

So,  as  I  was  saying,  the  Dublin  Zoological  Garden 
is  good,  although  it  might  be  better. 

The  district  around  Dublin,  et  infra,  is  of  a 
geological  formation,  which,  for  want  of  data,  I  am 
unable  to  determine. 


Thursday. 

Was  out  at  eight  and  walked  along  the  southern 
canal,  where  I  observed  abundance  of  Poa  aquatica 
and  Lycopus  Europceus,  together  with  other  more 
common  plants.  At  nine  went  to  Dr.  Evanson's 
to  breakfast,  where  I  met  a  number  of  medical 
gentlemen,  together  with  Pat  Doran,  the  mineral 
dealer.  One  of  these  gentlemen,  Dr.  John  Hart, 


JOURNAL  97 

took  me  to  the  hall  of  the  Dublin  Society,  chiefly 
to  see  the  splendid  specimen  of  Cervus  megaceros. 
It  is  indeed  a  magnificent  skeleton.  There  is  a  very 
extensive  collection  of  rocks  and  minerals,  occupy- 
ing several  apartments,  but  not  well  arranged,  and 
numerous  specimens  in  all  the  departments  of  zoology, 
together  with  Etruscan  vases,  antiquities,  casts  of 
statues,  and  various  other  articles.  The  disposition 
of  the  collections  is  bad,  and  the  rooms  are  not  very 
well  adapted  for  the  purpose,  although  they  are  by  no 
means  bad.  I  saw  Gieseke's  working  room,  his  Green- 
land curiosities,  and  other  articles.  About  twelve  I 
set  out  in  a  car,  accompanied  by  two  of  the  gentlemen 
and  Mrs.  Doran,  and,  traversing  the  city,  proceeded 
northward  about  seven  miles,  until  we  came  to  the 
Portmarnock  Sands. 

•  •  •  •  • 

At  Bell  Doyne  dined — returned  to  Dublin  by  six, 
after  a  very  pleasant  ride.  There  were  races  to-day 
near  Howth,  and  the  roads  were  crowded  with  cars  and 
other  vehicles. 

At  seven  called  on  Mr.  Houston,  but  did  not  find 
him  in,  and  at  the  College  of  Surgeons  to  meet  Mr. 
Beauchamp  (prond.  Beecham),  but  did  not  see  him, 
and  in  the  neighbourhood  on  Dr.  Evanson,  who  kept 
me  some  hours  and  sent  out  for  some  of  his  friends. 
I  have  not  experienced  more  kindness  anywhere  than 
I  have  here,  more  especially  from  Dr.  Evanson,  who  is 
a  fine,  frank,  gentlemanly,  rather  dashing  fellow. 

On  Friday  was  out  by  seven,  took  a  place  in  the

Steam  Packet  for  Bristol  and  was  on  board  before  eight, 
soon  after  which  we  started.     It  was  at  this  time  a  dull 
rainy   morning  with  a  light  breeze,  which,   however, 
presently  increased  to  a  gale,  so  that  we  were  obliged 
to   get   into    Kingstown    Harbour,  about   seven  miles 
from  Dublin.      It    continued   to  blow    furiously,  but 
having  abated  somewhat,  we  ventured  out  again,  and 
proceeded  along  the  coast  for  several  hours,  when  the 
captain,  judging  it  impossible  to  make  way  against  the 
wind  and  tide,  ordered  the  vessel  to  be  put  round,  and 
soon  after  we  anchored  in  our  former  station.     It  blew 
furiously,  with  very  heavy  rain,  until  daybreak,  when  it 
began   to  moderate.      At  six  we   again   set   out   and 
coasted  along  to  Wicklow  Head.     The  weather  was 
fine,  and  the   sea   not   so   high   as   might   have  been 
expected.     At  seven  we  were  off  St.  David's  Head, 
and  by  nine  were  fairly  in  the  Bristol  Channel.     The 
sea  was   high,   and   the  vessel   rolled   at   a  fine   rate, 
so   that   almost   all   the    passengers   were    desperately 
sick,  including  two  captains  of  the  Royal  Navy.      I 
escaped,  however,  by  keeping  in  a  recumbent  posture 
the  greater  part  of  the  time.     When  I  got  up  in  the 
morning  we  were  in  the  mouth  of  the  Severn,  and  after 
passing  up   the  beautiful   river    Avon,   we   landed   at 
Bristol  about  eight.     The  scenery  along  this  river  is 
singularly   splendid.      I   was   delighted   with   the  fine 
sections  of  stratified  rocks,  and  the   lovely  woodland 
scenery  interspersed  with  fields  and  villages.

GLOUCESTER  HOTEL,  CLIFTON,  BRISTOL, 

Sunday  evening,  15th  September  1833. 

Here  I  am  in  the  coffee-room  of  the  Gloucester 
Hotel,  where  everything  is  at  this  moment  very  quiet, 
although  the  voices  of  some  fellows  tippling  in  a  neigh- 
bouring apartment  are  making  their  way  through  the 
wall.  I  have  finished  three  cups  of  tea  and  half  a 
muffin.  Opposite  sits  a  tall  Englishman — I  know  he  is 
one,  although  I  took  no  note  of  his  speech.  He  has 
taken  half  an  hour  to  his  coffee  and  eatables,  ten 
minutes  to  smacking  his  lips,  five  to  picking  his  teeth, 
and  as  many  more  to  humming,  haing,  or  grunting,  and 
is  at  present  inspecting  a  newspaper.  At  another  table 
is  another  person,  who  is  similarly  occupied — save  the 
smacking,  picking,  and  grunting.  At  a  cabinet  is  -a 
fourth  looking  for  a  book,  and  at  a  table  is  a  fifth  read- 
ing the  Times,  or  basking  in  the  rays  of  the  True 
Sun.  What  a  difference  between  this  and  the  coffee- 
house of  the  Northumberland  buildings  in  Dublin, 
where,  while  I  was  discussing  my  beefsteak  and  subse- 
quent half-pint  of  vinum  flavum  and  cup  of  tea,  three 
Scottish  men  were  quarrelling  most  obstreperously,  one 
having  given  to  another  the  lie  direct.  The  affair 
ended  in  nothing,  however,  for  the  parties  were  evi- 
dently not  gentlemen.  The  Irishmen  present  were 
peeping  over  the  upper  margin  of  their  newspapers,  and 
the  eyes  of  all  the  waiters  were  directed  towards  the 
vulgar  disputants.  I  do  not  exactly  know  how  it  is, 
but  I  do  dislike  Ireland  and  its  inhabitants,  and  when 


100  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

I  arrived  here  to-day,  I  felt  as  if  I  had  got  among  old 
friends.  I  was  at  least  in  the  same  island.  The  scenery 
here  is  truly  English — an  undulated  country,  highly 
cultivated,  intersected  by  hedgerows,  and  interspersed 
with  clumps  of  wood.  As  to  the  fissure,  evidently  pro- 
duced by  the  disruption  of  the  limestone  strata,  in 
which  the  Avon  flows  over  its  tortuous  and  muddy  bed, 
it  is  only  to  be  seen  when  you  come  close  upon  it. 
The  views  along  this  river  are  exceedingly  beautiful,  St. 
Vincent's  rocks  rising  to  a  height  of  from  one  to  three 
hundred  feet.  So  far  as  I  have  observed,  they  seem  to 
belong  to  the  carboniferous  limestone  deposit,  and  are 
highly  inclined.  A  conglomerate  of  the  magnesian 
limestone  lies  over  this  deposit,  in  a  hollow  below  St. 
Vincent's  rocks. 

GLOUCESTER  HOTEL,  Monday,  16th  September  1833. 

Rose  at  seven  and  walked  down  the  river  side,  along 
the  base  of  the  cliffs  which  belong  to  the  mountain 
limestone  formation.  I  observed  a  very  considerable 
number  of  plants  unknown  to  me. 

Returned  to  the  inn  and  took  breakfast.  To-day 
again  the  large  Englishman.  Two  classes  of  men  eat 
deliberately,  and  smack  as  they  eat — the  gluttonous  and 
the  dyspeptic,  the  former  fond  of  eating  for  the  pleasure 
which  it  gives  them,  the  latter  eating  more  than  they 
are  disposed  to  eat  for  the  sake  of  the  supposed  benefit. 
This  man  is  stout,  healthy,  and  firm.  He  smacks, 
smiles  at  his  meals,  seems  to  have  his  whole  soul  in  the 


JOURNAL  101 

matter,  eats  and  drinks  deliberately,  hums  now  and  then 
to  clear  his  throat,  etc.  Hogs  smack  at  a  great  rate 
while  eating.  Smack,  smack,  smack — a  most  gentle- 
manly man  too,  un  homme  superbe.  I  would  not  live 
within  hearing  of  that  fellow  for  £200  a  year  in  addition, 
and  I  feel  tempted  to  wish  I  had  one  good  crack  at  his 
chops.  The  glutton  took  half  an  hour  to  it  too — chup, 
chup,  chup. 

The  principal  object  of  my  visit  to  Bristol  having 
been  the  inspection  of  the  Museum  of  the  Institution,  I 
now  went  to  that  "  elegant  building,"  as  it  is  called  in 
the  Bristol  Guide,  and  introducing  myself  as  myself  to 
the  keeper,  obtained  permission  to  examine  and  inspect. 
Nay,  the  good  fellow  accompanied  me  through  the 
whole,  showed  and  explained  everything,  and  afterwards 
demonstrated  the  geology  of  the  district  from  a  hill  top. 

The  collections  are  badly  distributed  in  small  rooms, 
the  principal  apartments  being  employed  for  other 
purposes — as  reading-room,  library,  lecture-room,  etc. ; 
but  they  are  extensive  and  valuable.  Rocks,  simple 
minerals,  and  fossils — fine  specimens,  capable  of  forming 
a  very  beautiful  series,  at  present  partially  arranged ; 
stuffed  quadrupeds  and  birds,  a  considerable  number, 
prepared  in  the  usual  style ;  some  skeletons,  good — a 
splendid  one  of  a  turtle — numerous  skulls,  magnificent 
Egyptian  mummies,  and  all  sorts  of  things,  including  a 
very  beautiful  "  marble  statue  of  Eve  at  the  fountain," 
by  E.  H.  Baily,  R.A.,  purchased  from  that  artist  by  the 
Institution  for  600  guineas.  There  is  a  bad  flaw  in  the 
right  thigh,  and  two  patches,  one  on  the  back ;  the 


102  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

other  on  the  right  elbow.  But  overlook  these  defects 
in  the  stone,  and  if  you  do  not  consider  the  statue 
superior  to  many  of  the  very  finest  antiques.  For  my 
part,  I  would  rather  have  it  than  the  whole  Museum 
together,  although  the  latter  is  doubtless  convertible 
into  more  money,  and  more  useful  to  the  bargain. 

•  *  •  •  • 

The  Institution  has  only  existed  a  few  years,  and 
yet  the  collection  is  already  very  extensive.  Every 
collection  that  I  see  makes  me  regret  the  more  our 
want  of  a  decent  series  illustrative  of  comparative 
anatomy.  The  series  of  skulls  of  mammalia  which  we 
have  is  extremely  contemptible ;  and  we  are  equally 
deficient  in  most  of  the  other  departments.  The  collec- 
tion ought  to  be  extended  or  obliterated.  As  it  is,  it  is 
in  my  opinion  a  disgrace  to  the  College. 

The  keeper  is  certainly  a  very  nice  fellow,  totally 
destitute  of  all  affectation  or  assumption,  apparently 
possessed  of  very  considerable  knowledge  in  geology. 

After  packing  my  movables,  including  myself,  into 
an  omnibus,  which  was  large  enough  for  its  contents, 
seeing  it  contained  only  one  individual,  I  proceeded 
towards  Bristol,  where  I  ascended  a  stage-coach  bound 
for  London.  Soon  after  we  were  on  our  way  to  Bath, 
through  which  we  passed  in  the  dusk.  The  night  was 
clear  and  rather  cold,  but  towards  three  in  the  morning 
it  began  to  rain,  and  continued  wet  until  we  arrived  in 
London,  which  event  took  place  between  seven  and 
eight.  I  was  set  down,  quite  benumbed,  about  eight 
at  the  George  Inn,  Aldermansbury,  not  far  from  St. 


JOURNAL  103 

Paul's.  So  I  made  a  partial  shifting,  a  rude  shaving, 
and  a  good  breakfasting,  and  thereafter  sallied  forth. 
St.  Paul's  I  had  seen  before ;  it  did  not  excite  much 
wonder.  Strolling  along  I  got  to  Waterloo  Bridge,  and 
inspected  Hungerford  Market,  which  latter  afforded  me 
a  good  deal  of  amusement.  Soon  after  I  went  to  the 
British  Museum,  which  is  at  present  shut  upon  its 
proprietors,  the  public.  However  I  had  a  letter  to 
Master  Grey,  and  he  being  absent  I  presented  it  to  his 
brother.  He  gave  me  permission  to  walk  in,  and  when 
disengaged  from  Professor  Lichtenstein  of  Berlin,  then 
on  a  visit,  showed  me  all  the  apartments  in  succession. 
It  is  unnecessary  to  describe  this  splendid  and  extensive 
museum,  as  there  is  a  catalogue  of  it  published.  How- 
ever, 1  have  taken  some  notes. 

•  •  •  •  • 

Montagu's  collection  of  British  birds,  which  is  fine 
on  account  of  its  extent,  but  does  not  contain  ten  well- 
stuffed  specimens.  When  are  we  to  see  some  improve- 
ment in  this  art  ?  Surely  it  were  better  to  give  an  artist 
twenty  shillings  for  a  fine  specimen  than  five  for  a  bad  one. 
Every  stufFer  has  a  way  of  his  own  in  which  he  prepares 
all  birds.  In  Edinburgh,  Black  John,  and  Carfrae,  and 
Gibson  have  each  a  peculiar  mode — every  species  has 
the  same  attitude.  The  late  Mr.  Wilson  was  a  good 
stuffer  of  grouse,  but  he  stuffed  all  birds  in  precisely  the 
same  style.  The  pervading  style  of  Montagu's  birds  is 
distortion.  There  is  not,  so  far  as  I  have  observed,  one 
faultless  specimen  among  them.  Good  collection  of 
eggs.  Montagu's  shells  in  glazed  tables — pretty  good. 


104  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

and  fine,  but  not  extraordinary.  Mr.  Nicol  in  Edin- 
burgh has  a  much  finer  collection. 

General  collection  of  birds  and  shells.  The  former  n  ot 
remarkable  for  its  extent,  and  miserable  as  to  stuffing. 

The  splendid  gallery  behind  is  lighted  from  the 
roof,  as  are  the  two  last  rooms.  The  floor  is  of  oak, 
the  roof  on  the  same  plan  as  that  of  the  Museum  of  the 
Edinburgh  College  of  Surgeons,  and  having  the  same 
defects.  The  floor  is  already  damaged  by  water.  Who 
copied  ?  or  did  both  copy  ?  The  architects  who  have 
no  genius  make  Grecian  buildings. 

There  is  another  smacking  Englishman  in  the  coffee- 
room,  and  I  am  tormented  by  him.  Smack,  smack, 
smack !  He  is  a  sulky  cur,  too,  and  the  waiter  cannot 
please  him.  I  almost  wish  he  had  a  piece  of  album 
grocum  in  his  cheek.  But  to  proceed. 

Two  rows  of  tables — glazed,  with  minerals — very 
splendid,  and  beautifully  arranged,  although  not  yet 
properly  named.  They  are  laid  on  cotton,  which  covers 
a  board,  having  a  raised  black  margin.  Now,  it  is 
pleasant  to  look  at  such  an  arrangement,  although  there 
are  persons  who  care  very  little  about  the  matter,  and 
who  would  as  readily  put  on  their  coat  with  the  back 

before,  provided  it  lay  easily.  Dr.  is  of  this 

character,  and  a  member  of  the  College  of  Surgeons. 

Comparatively  few  of  the  articles  in  the  Museum  are 
yet  named.  The  shells  are  generally  placed  on  dispro- 
portionately large  cards,  and  might  with  advantage  be 
made  to  occupy  less  than  half  the  space. 

As    to    Cook's    curiosities,   and    all    the    Hindoo, 


JOURNAL  105 

Egyptian,  and  Grecian  statues  and  fragments,  I  leave 
them  to  the  curious  in  these  matters.  I  can  consider 
the  Eve  of  the  Bristol  Institution  superior  to  the  whole. 

I  had  letters  to  certain  persons,  and  began  to  search 
for  them,  but  found  them  not.  However,  I  got  my  old 
and  very  excellent  friend  Dr.  Grant,  with  whom  I 
dined.  We  had  a  long  crack.  He  complains  desper- 
ately of  the  affairs  of  his  college,  his  whole  income  for 
the  last  year  not  having  exceeded  £120. 

It  rained  furiously  as  I  was  going  home,  and  I  did 
not  find  my  way  without  some  difficulty.  London  is  an 
ugly  wilderness.  "My  own  romantic  town"  is  the 
best  I  have  seen  after  all. 

The  Portland  or  Barberini  vase  in  the  British 
Museum  is  much  inferior  to  the  model  of  it  by 
Wedgewood  in  the  Edinburgh  University  Museum. 
It  is  of  blue  glass,  with  white  opaque  figures.  The 
model  mentioned  has  a  black  opaque  ground ;  that  of 
the  Liverpool  Institution  has  a  blue  ground. 

The  hall  for  the  Royal  Library,  300  feet  in  length, 
is  splendid.  Two  scoundrels  in  the  room  in  which  I 
write  are  damning  and  blaspheming,  so  I  must  leave 
them  to  their  meditations. 

Wednesday,  18th  September  1833. 

Having  had  no  sleep  on  the  way  from  Bristol  to 
London,  I  remained  in  bed  till  near  nine.  After  break- 
fast I  went  out,  took  a  tortuous  direction  through  the 
city,  and  arrived  at  Dr.  Grant's,  10  Seymour  Place, 
North,  Euston  Square. 


106  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

Dr.  Grant  accompanied  me  to  the  London  Uni- 
versity in  Gower  Street. 

Saw  his  own  collection  of  comparative  anatomy 
and  zoology,  which  is  contained  in  his  lecture-room,  and 
although  consisting  of  a  considerable  number  of  articles, 
is  not  by  any  means  fine,  and  certainly  is  not  neatly 
kept  or  well  arranged. 

The  collection  of  materia  medica  is  in  all  respects 
excellent. 

The  anatomical  and  pathological  collection  of  the 
University  is  in  a  square  room  of  moderate  size,  with 
a  gallery. 

•  •  •  •  • 

The  preparations  are  very  beautiful.  The  heads  of 
the  bottles  are  very  neatly  secured  and  painted  in  the 
usual  way.  The  ticketing  and  numbering  neat.  Every- 
thing in  excellent  order,  and  cleanly.  The  whole  has  a 
finished  and  beautiful  appearance. 

The  room  containing  the  apparatus  for  the  natural 
philosophy  class  is  also  very  neatly  fitted  up  with  large 
glazed  cases,  and  the  collection  is  excellent. 

We  went  next  to  King's  College,  which  forms  the 
east  wing  to  Somerset  House,  but  the  Museum  was  shut. 

Went  then  to  the  Geological  Society,  in  the  vicinity. 
Models,  casts,  and  specimens  of  various  kinds.  The 
principal  part  of  the  collection  is  arranged  in  presses 
fitted  up  with  drawers.  There  is  nothing  particularly 
remarkable  about  them,  excepting  two  circumstances. 


JOURNAL  107 

1st.  As  geological  and  mineralogical  specimens  are 
liable  to  be  much  injured  by  dust,  those  contained  in  the 
drawers  are  secured  by  means  of  four  sheets  of  paper 
fastened  along  the  sides  of  each  drawer  and  laid  over  the 
specimens  in  succession. 

The  method  has  several  inconveniences.  The 
articles  cannot  be  inspected  without  taking  out  the 
drawer  and  laying  it  on  a  table.  Then  there  are  four 
awkward  flaps  of  paper  appended  to  each  drawer.  It 
would  be  much  better  to  cover  it  with  calico  stretched 
upon  a  frame  exactly  fitting. 

2nd.  Each  drawer  in  front  has  a  small  brass  frame 
for  the  general  label,  which  slips  into  it.  The  drawers 
in  the  Museum  of  the  Edinburgh  University  are  fur- 
nished with  similar  appendages. 

•  •  •  *  • 

Then  we  visited  the  Museum  of  the  Zoological 
Society  in  Bruton  Street.  The  house  is  too  small  and 
inconvenient,  and  the  Society  are  meditating  a  removal. 

First  room,  small — square.  Glazed  cases,  about  8 
feet  high,  and  2j  deep.  Movable  shelves,  supported  by 
small  square  bars. 

In  this  room  is  a  fine  collection  of  mammalia,  the 
best  stuffed  that  I  have  seen — extremely  crowded. 
Dugong,  camelopard  and  skeleton ;  oran  outan,  red, 
adult,  and  young — several  black  ones,  etc.  Skulls,  horns, 
tortoises,  snakes,  etc.,  on  the  walls.  Shells  on  a  glazed 
table,  arranged  on  cards  of  oak  covered  with  paper. 

Second  room  upstairs.  Birds  in  very  neat 
mahogany  glazed  cases.  Shells  movable. 


108  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

I  did  not  succeed  in  finding  the  College  of  Surgeons, 
and  coming  upon  Park  Crescent  and  Square,  I  visited 
the  Colosseum  in  the  Regent's  Park.  The  Panorama 
of  London,  for  the  exhibition  of  which  this  building  was 
erected,  struck  me  as  being  the  grandest  feat  of  art  which 
I  have  seen.  The  deception  was  to  me  quite  perfect. 
The  saloon  for  works  of  art  I  found  also  highly  interest- 
ing. The  other  appendages,  viz.  the  conservatories, 
caverns,  and  Swiss  cottage,  were  very  pretty  and  amusing. 
The"  African  Glen, "containing  stuffed  animals,  I  thought 
inferior  to  everything  else,  although  interesting  to  a 
zoologist. 

I  then  visited  the  Zoological  Gardens  on  the  north 
side  of  the  Park.  They  are  laid  out  with  great  taste, 
and  contain  a  very  large  collection  of  animals  disposed 
in  suitable  habitacles.  If  I  had  time,  I  should  find  it 
very  instructive  to  study  the  attitudes  of  the  animals, 
especially  the  birds.  To  the  zoological  painter  collections 
of  living  animals  must  prove  of  the  greatest  importance. 
It  is  in  fact  utterly  absurd  to  draw  from  stuffed  skins. 

Thursday,  IQth  September  1833. 

Went  in  the  first  place  to  the  Excise  Office,  where 
I  found  my  old  friends  Mr.  Murray  and  Mr.  Linning, 
both  of  Edinburgh.  Mr.  Linning  urged  me  to  remove 
to  his  house,  and  remain  a  week  or  so  in  town,  to  see 
the  museums  more  leisurely.  I  then  went  to  Lincoln's 
Inn  Fields,  and  delivered  my  letter  of  introduction  to  Mr. 
Clift,  who  informed  me  that  the  Museum  was  shut,  and 


JOURNAL  109 

that  although  I  might  have  a  glance  of  it  to-day,  I  should 
have  a  better  opportunity  of  seeing  it  to-morrow.  So  I 
crossed  the  river  by  Waterloo  Bridge,  walked  through  part 
of  Surrey,  and  came  upon  St.  Thomas's  Hospital,  where 
I  was  informed  that  the  Museum  could  not  be  seen. 

At  Guy's  Hospital  I  did  not  find  Dr.  Hodgkin,  to 
whom  I  had  a  letter,  but  introduced  myself  to  the 
keepers,  and  was  allowed  to  inspect  the  museums. 

The  anatomical  and  pathological  collections  are 
principally  contained  in  an  oblong  elevated  apartment, 
lighted  from  the  roof. 

On  the  floor  a  skeleton  of  the  hippopotamus  ;  another 
of  the  elephant — both  fine,  but  the  latter  small. 

Four  tables — on  one  of  which  are  wax  models  of  the 
brain,  neck,  face,  thorax,  etc.,  extremely  beautiful. 

On  the  other  three  tables  a  most  beautiful  series  of 
wax  models  illustrative  of  cutaneous  diseases  in  glass 
shades  and  bottles. 

I  then  visited  the  Museum  of  Comparative  Anatomy, 
and  the  Obstetrical  Museum,  which  are  kept  in  the 
rooms  of  two  small  dwelling-houses,  by  no  means  adapted 
to  such  a  purpose. 

Skeletons  of  quadrupeds,  birds,  etc.,  in  general  very 
good,  and  beautifully  prepared.  The  artificial  cartilages 
of  the  ribs  are  very  beautifully  made,  painted  white — 
splendid  skeleton  of  a  snake  about  eight  feet  long.  This 
collection,  however,  is  not  extensive. 

The  obstetrical  collection  consists  of  models  and 
preparations. 


110  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

On  the  whole,  the  collections  are  in  excellent  con- 
dition, the  materials  are  of  the  best  quality,  and  the 
models  and  casts  are  splendid.  The  apartments  might 
be  better  adapted  to  the  purpose  of  a  museum  ;  but  the 
collection  may  safely  be  called  one  of  the  finest  in 
Britain. 

After  visiting  Guy's  Hospital,  I  repaired  to  Mr. 
Linning's,  where  I  dined,  in  company  with  Mr.  Murray 
and  a  Dr.  Campbell,  Miss  Linning  and  Master  Linning. 
We  had  a  very  pleasant  evening  of  it.  On  returning  to 
the  city,  along  with  Mr.  Murray,  I  went  to  his  lodgings, 
where  I  remained  nearly  two  hours,  and  had  a  long  crack. 

Friday,  20th  September  1833. 

Called  on  Mr.  Stanley,  12  Lincoln's  Inn  Fields. 
Then  went  to  the  Museum  of  the  Royal  College  of 
Surgeons — otherwise  called  the  Hunterian  Museum. 
Saw  Mr.  Clift,  who  began  to  describe  certain  objects, 
but  finding  him  much  too  prolix,  I  took  a  convenient 
opportunity  of  slipping  away,  and  examined  for  myself. 
•  •  •  •  . 

This  splendid  collection  presents  an  example  of  a 
museum  overstocked,  there  being  materials  for  furnish- 
ing three  apartments  of  the  same  size. 

Some  of  the  stuffed  animals,  skeletons,  bones,  and 
horns,  horribly  dirty.  The  walls  and  roof  also  dingy 
with  dust. 

.  .  .  .  . 

It  is  impossible  to  offer  any  detailed  description  of 
the  Museum,  for  which  reference  must  be  made  to  the 


JOURNAL  111 

printed  catalogue.  It  is  a  magnificent  collection,  and 
the  room  is  fine ;  but  everything  is  so  crowded  that  there 
is  more  appearance  of  confusion  than  of  regularity,  and 
there  is  more  dirt  everywhere  than  there  ought  to  be. 

Excepting  the  Museum  of  Guy's  Hospital,  that  of 
the  London  University,  and  that  of  the  Glasgow  College, 
I  have  seen  none  approaching  to  our  own  in  cleanliness. 

After  leaving  the  Hunterian  Museum,  went  to  Mr. 
Linning's,  where  I  dined.  Returned  as  usual  to  the 
George  Inn,  Aldermansbury,  in  the  coffee-room  of  which 
I  now  am,  absolutely  smoking  with  perspiration,  caused 
by  three  cups  of  tea,  and  an  atmospheric  temperature 
of  eighty  degrees. 

Saturday,  2Ist' September  1833. 

Having  been  entrusted  with  three  letters  for  Sir 
James  MacGregor,  I  proceeded  after  nine  to  Berkley 
Street,  which  I  reached  about  twelve,  after  having  strolled 
about  in  the  Park  and  elsewhere.  He  had  not  yet 
arrived  at  the  office,  so  I  left  the  letters  and  my  card 
for  him,  and  returned  towards  "  the  City."  By  the  way 
left  a  letter  at  Mr.  Gould's,  Broad  Street,  Golden  Square. 
He  is  a  celebrated  preparer  of  objects  of  natural  history  ; 
but  he  being  out,  I  had  no  opportunity  of  seeing  him. 
Some  of  his  performances,  however,  I  had  seen  in  the 
Zoological  Society's  collection,  and  they  are  highly 
creditable.  After  this,  I  examined  the  Museum  of 
King's  College,  which  is  open  to  the  public  every  day 
excepting  Wednesday.  It  is  contained  in  two  rooms — 
a  large  and  a  smaller.  These  apartments  are  well  adapted 


112  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

for  the  purpose.  They  are  plain,  without  the  encum- 
brance of  ornamental  columns,  pilasters,  and  all  the 
rubbish  that  usually  disfigures  museums,  and  are  lighted 
from  the  side,  which  is  obviously  the  best  mode  of 
lighting. 

The  anatomical  and  pathological  preparations  are 
good,  and  being  fresh  and  neatly  put  up,  look  exceed- 
ingly well.  There  are  a  few  good  skeletons  of  animals, 
and  a  number  of  excellent  casts  and  models  of 
cutaneous  diseases,  etc.  These  models  are  inferior 
only  to  those  of  Guy's  Hospital,  if  indeed  they  be  so. 
The  person  who  makes  them  is  Mr.  W.  Tuson,  anatomical 
modeller,  King's  College.  The  stands  of  the  skeletons 
are  tolerable,  but  as  usual  they  are  deficient  in  uni- 
formity. I  have  seen  none  at  all  approaching  to  our 
own  in  neatness  and  just  proportion. 

I  had  a  note  from  Mr.  Stanley  to  Mr.  Partridge, 
and  that  gentleman,  the  curator,  and  the  modeller 
were  very  attentive  to  me.  The  numbering  is  on 
the  lower  part  of  the  bottles :  black  figures  on  a 
white  ground. 

On  leaving  King's  College  I  went  to  the  Excise 
Office,  whence  Mr.  Linning  accompanied  me  to 
Bartholomew's  Hospital,  where  I  found  Mr.  Stanley, 
and  had  the  remarkables  pointed  out  by  the  keeper 
of  the  Museum. 

It  is  small  for  such  an  establishment,  in  a  single 
oblong  apartment  lighted  from  the  roof.  There  is 
a  narrow  gallery.  The  cases  are  open,  run  along  the 


JOURNAL  113 

wall,  have  movable  shelves,  and  are  of  convenient 
height,  especially  those  of  the  gallery,  which  are  about 
7  feet  in  height.  The  collection  is  confined  to  human 
anatomy  and  pathology — the  latter  below,  the  former 
in  the  gallery.  The  anatomical  series  is  not  extensive. 
The  preparations  are  put  up  in  the  usual  manner,  and 
with  the  ordinary  degree  of  neatness.  Some  of  the 
bottles,  containing  objects  whose  colours  are  liable 
to  fade,  are  enclosed  in  a  movable  cylinder  of  blue 
pasteboard.  This  is  the  only  place  in  which  I  have 
seen  this  contrivance  employed. 

•  .  •  •  • 

After  inspecting  this  museum,  and  visiting  the  dis- 
secting room,  etc.,  I  accompanied  Mr.  Linning  to  Lloyd 
Street,  where  I  dined,  and  whence  I  returned  after  eight. 

•  •  •  •  • 

Under  existing  circumstances  it  is  impossible  to 
examine  objects  in  series.  Were  a  person  disposed  to 
study  healthy  and  diseased  structure  from  preparations, 
he  would  find  ample  opportunities  in  the  museums  here, 
and  in  the  department  of  comparative  anatomy.  The 
Museum  of  the  College  of  Surgeons  would  alone  furnish 
objects,  the  proper  inspection  of  which  would  take  many 
months. 

With  respect  to  the  osseous  system  of  animals, 
there  is  certainly  a  most  extensive  series  in  the 
different  museums  taken  together.  This  is  also  the 
case  with  respect  to  teeth,  horns,  hoofs  and  claws. 
The  Hunterian  collection  exhibits  all  the  other  organs 
in  series  more  or  less  complete.

114  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

As  to  zoology,  properly  so  called,  there  are  also 
abundant  materials. 

Mammalia,  between  the  Zoological  Society's  collec- 
tion, the  British  Museum,  and  the  Hunterian — a  very 
extensive  series. 

Birds  in  the  Zoological  Society,  British  Museum,  etc. 

Reptiles  in  abundance. 

Fishes  less  complete,  all  the  other  departments  in 
one  degree  or  other. 

After  all  there  cannot  be  a  perfect  naturalist  who 
has  not  studied  long  in  the  metropolis ;  but  study 
there  will  not  of  itself  make  a  naturalist.  Yet  museums 
are  evidently  indispensable. 

I  have  seen  no  good  collection  of  insects,  but  there 
are  many  private  ones  in  London. 

In  mineralogy  the  British  Museum  is  almost  com- 
plete ;  but  one  cannot  study  this  science  without  being 
allowed  to  handle  the  specimens. 

For  the  geologist,  the  Geological  Society's  collec- 
tion and  the  organic  remains  in  the  British  Museum 
and  elsewhere. 


Sunday,  Z2nd  September  1833. 

Having  slept  too  long,  I  was  not  out  in  time  to  go 
to  the  Scotch  Church,  near  the  Regent's  Park,  where 
I  had  engaged  to  meet  Mr.  Linning,  so  I  went  to 
St.  Paul's.  The  interior  of  this  building,  I  think,  must 
strike  a  stranger  more  than  its  exterior.  After  morn- 
ing service  I  crossed  the  river  by  Southwark  Bridge, 


JOURNAL  115 

on  which  I  found  Mr.  Murray  peripatising.  I  pro- 
ceeded eastward  with  the  view  of  taking  a  walk  into 
the  country,  it  being  a  beautiful  day,  but  an  omnibus 
coming  up,  I  went  upon  it,  and  was  conveyed  to 
Greenwich,  of  which  I  visited  the  magnificent  hospital, 
saw  some  of  the  old  boys  at  their  dinner,  entered  the 
painted  hall  of  King  William's  building,  inspected  the 
representations  of  naval  heroes  and  battles,  and  listened 
for  a  few  minutes  to  the  demonstrations  of  a  respect- 
able-looking personage  with  a  long  white  rod,  until 
he  began  to  show  that  "  now,  the  four  corners  of  that 
great  square  represents  the  h elements,"  when  1  marched 
out,  entered  the  park,  ascended  the  hill  of  the 
observatory,  and  after  a  pleasant  walk  among  the  fine 
trees,  emerged  into  Blackheath.  I  then  proceeded 
along  the  road,  over  Shooters'  Hill,  and  down  its 
eastern  side,  until  I  had  arrived  within  two  miles  of 
Dartford,  when  a  coach  came  up,  and  I  got  upon  it. 
We  arrived  at  Chatham  about  six. 

In  the  whole  course  of  this  ride  I  had  abundant 
opportunity  of  seeing  what  I  had  never  seen  before, 
a  chalk  district.  Immense  excavations  have  been 
made,  and  the  road  in  many  places  has  been  cut  deep 
into  the  deposit,  exposing  the  strata  of  chalk,  inter- 
spersed with  black  flint,  and  nearly  horizontal. 

Beautiful  views  of  the  Thames,  covered  with 
shipping,  occurred  at  intervals ;  and  at  Rochester  the 
scenery  is  fine,  the  Medway,  the  splendid  old  castle,  the 
city,  the  ships  in  the  river,  the  chalk  cliffs,  and  other 
interesting  objects  presenting  themselves  in  succession. 


116  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

The  diluvium  on  Blackheath  and  elsewhere  consists 
of  sand  and  pebbles  of  black  flint,  which  are  used  for 
making  the  roads.  The  country  is  very  beautiful,  flat, 
or  gently  undulated,  and  more  profusely  wooded  than 
I  should  have  expected.  About  Chatham  the  ground 
is  more  undulated,  but  the  chalk  strata  are  still  nearly 
horizontal,  the  valleys  having  apparently  been  pro- 
duced by  diluvial  excavation.  The  houses  in  the 
towns  and  villages  are  built  of  brick,  but  are  neat,  and 
the  people  everywhere  seemed  in  the  most  prosperous 
condition,  even  the  labourers  being  remarkably  well 
clothed  and  "looking  like  their  meat,"  as  people  say 
in  Scotland.  I  was  surprised  at  the  great  number  of 
very  elegantly -formed  and  graceful  young  women. 
The  features  of  the  inhabitants  are  more  regular  and 
less  weathered  (as  a  geologist  would  say)  than  those 
in  any  part  of  Scotland.  The  men  are,  on  the  whole, 
stout  and  independent-looking.  They  are  not  lumpish 
either,  as  in  Lancashire  and  elsewhere,  but  rather  active. 

I  have  not  met  with  an  instance  of  incivility  since  I 
entered  England  ;  but  I  have  the  same  to  say  of  Scotland 
and  Ireland — although  sometimes,  particularly  by  clerks 
in  offices  or  shops,  one  is  answered  by  a  single  word. 

From  half-past  ten,  when  I  went  to  bed,  to  near 
five,  I  was  tormented  by  bugs,  which  bit  in  all 
directions :  right  and  left,  over  the  face,  neck,  arms, 
back,  and  legs,  not  even  sparing  the  crown  of  the 
head.  As  I  had  no  oil,  which  is  a  specific,  I  was 
obliged  to  use  the  tallow  of  the  candle  to  rub  the 
bitten  parts. 


JOURNAL  117 

Monday,  23rd  September  1833. 

After  breakfast  I  called  on  Mr.  Dadd,  apothecary, 
to  whom  I  had  a  letter  from  Mr.  Hay,  and  proceeded 
to  Fort  Pitt,  where  I  found  Dr.  Clark,  to  whom  I  had 
a  letter  from  Dr.  William  Thomson.  He  introduced 
me  to  Dr.  MacCrae,  Curator  of  the  Museum,  who 
forthwith  accompanied  me  to  it.  It  is  contained  in 
two  apartments  of  the  ordinary  form,  fitted  up  with 
cases  ranged  along  the  walls.  The  preparations  are 
good,  and  minute  and  accurate  cases  are  kept  of  those 
made  from  specimens  obtained  in  the  hospital.  There 
is  a  very  extensive  series  of  national  skulls,  of  which  I 
am  informed  there  are  many  duplicates,  which  may  be 
given  in  exchange. 

.  .  .  •  • 

The  cases  are  rather  high,  but  on  the  whole  this 
museum  is  in  good  order,  although  not  very  extensive. 

Mr.  Robert  Jameson,  Professor  Jameson's  nephew, 
now  made  his  appearance,  and  accompanied  me  to  the 
Natural  History  Museum,  of  which  he  has  temporary 
charge.  It  is  also  contained  in  two  apartments,  fitted 
with  open  and  glazed  cases  along  the  walls,  having  fixed 
shelves. 

There  are  also  glazed  tables  on  the  floor.  The 
collection,  although  not  extensive,  is  very  good.  The 
arrangement  is  not  perhaps  the  best.  The  birds  are  kept 
as  skins  merely,  which  is  a  good  enough  way.  A  good 
collection  of  reptiles ;  and  in  general  more  or  less  in 
every  department. 


118  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

I  then  accompanied  Mr.  Jameson  to  the  dockyard 
at  Chatham,  ascended  a  74-gunship  in  process  of 
building,  examined  the  chalk  section  on  Chatham  Hill, 
looked  into  the  Chatham  Museum,  went  round  Fort 
Pitt,  took  some  refreshment,  and  proceeded  in  an 
omnibus  to 

The  Museum.  It  is  a  general  collection ;  but  the 
most  remarkable  objects  in  it  are  the  fossils  of  the  chalk 
formation.  It  is  small,  and  contained  in  a  narrow  and 
shabby-looking  apartment.  There  is  a  good  collection 
of  birds,  so  far  as  it  goes,  contained  in  glazed  cases  or 
boxes. 

The  weather  continued  fine.  I  had  lost  the  regular 
conveyance ;  but  getting  into  a  small  omnibus  I  pro- 
ceeded to  Gravesend,  where  I  had  not  remained  ten 
minutes  when  an  opportunity  occurred  of  getting  to 
London,  and  at  ten  o'clock  I  was  set  down  at  Charing 
Cross.  So  I  presently  got  to  the  George  Inn,  supped 
with  a  Cornish  gentleman  of  very  pleasing  manners, 
wrote  part  of  my  notes,  and  after  some  annoyance  from  a 
drunken  party  bawling  in  an  adjoining  room,  fell  asleep. 

It  may  now  be  proper  to  make  a  general  review  of 
my  proceedings  in  London,  and  a  prospectus  of  what  is 
to  be  done. 

I  have  visited : — 

Museums  of  the  London  University. 
Anatomical  Museum  of  King's  College. 
British  Museum. 
Museum  of  Zoological  Society.

Tuesday,  24&gt;th  September  1833. 

Went  to  Dr.  Hodgkin,  9  New  Broad  Street,  who 
advised  me  to  make  another  visit  to  Guy's  Hospital 
to-morrow,  and  gave  me  a  letter  to  one  of  the  surgeons 
of  St.  Thomas's  Hospital,  Mr.  MacMurdo,  and  to  the 
proprietor  of  Heaviside's  Museum,  so  I  went  to 
MacMurdo's,  but,  not  rinding  him,  left  my  letter  with 
his  wife.  I  then  went  to  Heaviside's  Museum,  but  the 
old  boy  was  busy,  and  rather  pettish,  and  could  not 


120 

show  it.  I  then  travelled  westward,  called  at  Dr. 
Tweedie's,  30  Montague  Place,  Russell  Square,  but  did 
not  find  him,  and  so  left  my  letter  with  Mrs.  Tweedie. 
Then  went  to  Dr.  Carswell's  with  a  letter  from  Dr. 
Thomson — found  him  and  delivered  my  letter.  Then 
went  to  Mr.  Linning's,  where  I  dined.  In  the  evening 
wrote  a  letter,  and  arranged  my  affairs. 

Notes  respecting  the  Museum  of  the  Edinburgh 
College  of  Surgeons : — 

1st.  Department  of  Healthy  Anatomy. — To  be  kept 
distinct  from  that  of  comparative  anatomy,  which, 
however,  is  to  be  arranged  parallel  to  it,  on  the  opposite 
side  of  the  same  apartment. 

The  arrangement  for  the  present  may  be  that  which 
is  adopted,  viz.  bones,  ligaments,  muscles,  brain  and 
nerves,  blood  vessels,  pulmonary  organs,  digestive,  etc. ; 
but  a  more  correct  arrangement  would  be  : — 

Brain  and  Nerves.  Organs  of  Secretion. 

Organs  of  Sense.  Organs  of  Locomotion. 

Organs  of  Circulation.  Organs  of  Generation. 

Organs  of  Nutrition.  Organs  of  Lactation. 

The  fact,  however,  is  that  one  may  begin  at  any 
point  in  the  animal  economy ;  and  whatever  method  is 
best  calculated  for  demonstrating  the  structure  of  the 
perfect  body  is  the  best  for  the  arrangement  of  an 
anatomical  collection. 

The  cases  being  of  two  kinds,  viz.  glazed  presses 
and  open  shelves,  a  separation  of  preparations,  accord- 
ing as  they  are  dry  or  wet,  is  necessary.  This  is  a 


JOURNAL  121 

desperate  evil  in  a  museum,  and  is  productive  of  great 
confusion. 

In  an  anatomical  museum  the  cases  ought  to 
be  all  glazed,  8  feet  high,  elevated  half  a  foot  from 
the  floor,  2  feet  deep,  and  furnished  with  movable 
shelving. 

Such  a  museum  should  be  in  the  form  of  one  or 
more  rooms,  in  the  upper  flat  of  a  building,  12  feet  high, 
20  feet  broad,  lighted  from  the  roof,  with  low,  flat,  glazed 
tables  along  the  middle  of  the  floor. 

Architectural  decoration  ought  not  by  any  means  to 
be  admitted.  The  style  should  be  perfectly  simple. 

Such  a  museum  might  be  polygonal. 

In  our  Museum  the  exposed  ticketing  should  be 
suspended,  the  cards  smaller  than  they  are  at  present, 
the  articles  numbered,  the  divisions  lettered. 

2nd.  Department  of  Comparative  Anatomy. — As  the 
cases  are  precisely  the  same  as  those  for  the  department 
of  human  anatomy,  disorder  cannot  be  avoided.  The 
same  disposition  as  to  the  preparations  should  be 
followed  ;  but  the  articles  should  be  arranged  according 
to  the  classes  to  which  they  belong,  the  subdivisions 
being  the  same  as  the  divisions  in  human  anatomy. 

A  museum  for  comparative  anatomy  ought  to  be 
very  differently  constructed  from  one  for  human 
anatomy,  as  the  case  fitted  for  the  skeleton  of  a  man 
is  not  adapted  for  that  of  an  elephant  or  a  mouse. 

Such  a  museum  must  be  of  larger  dimensions, 
elevated,  and  lighted  from  the  roof  as  well  as  the 
sides.

3rd.  Pathology. — The  pathological  series  answers 
very  well  for  the  galleries  of  our  Museum.  It  was  the 
opinion  of  one  of  the  members  that  it  ought  to  have 
been  placed  below ;  but  he  has  lived  long  enough  to 
confess  his  error.  There  is  the  same  defect,  of  dissimilar 
cases,  productive  of  disorder,  which  cannot  be  avoided. 

Preparations  and  casts  should  be  equally  included  in 
the  series ;  but,  as  many  of  the  latter  are  too  large  for 
the  cases,  they  may  be  kept  apart  in  a  room  devoted  for 
that  purpose. 

The  calculi  must  be  placed  in  glazed  tables,  and  the 
floor  ought  to  be  considered  as  general  receptacle  for 
exordinals  belonging  to  any  of  all  the  three  series. 

The  catalogue  must  be  regularly  made  out,  accord- 
ing to  the  organs  or  diseases,  and  not  according  to  the 
cases,  shelving,  or  tables,  though  the  latter  must  always 
be  referred  to  at  every  article. 

The  system  of  ticketing  must  be  as  follows  : — 

The  exposed  tickets  uniform  as  to  size  and  writing, 
numbered  to  correspond  with  the  numbers  of  the  articles, 
varnished,  of  a  neat  oblong  form,  suspended  over  the 
preparation. 

The  tickets  within  the  glazed  cases  to  be  of  the  same 
size,  suspended  if  possible ;  if  not,  to  be  supported  by  a 
small  piece  of  wood  with  a  groove,  painted  white. 

Every  museum  ought  to  have  a  library  containing 
such  books  as  are  necessary  for  reference  or  illustration. 

It  ought  to  be  well  and  neatly  arranged,  kept  re- 
markably clean.,  and  free  of  all  smells,  as  of  varnish, 
turpentine,  camphor,  and  especially  putrefaction. 


JOURNAL  123 

It  ought  to  have  the  proper  number  of  hands,  and 
the  keepers  and  assistants  should  not  be  overpaid,  nor 
yet  too  scantily  supplied,  otherwise  they  become 
negligent. 

Wednesday,  25tk  September  1833. 

In  the  morning  made  inquiries  respecting  coaches  to 
Edinburgh,  and  in  Gracechurch  Street  bought  four 
ounces  of  entomological  pins  for  Mr.  Maclagan,  price 
8s.  9d.  Crossed  the  Thames  by  London  Bridge,  and 
introduced  myself  at  the  Museum  of  St.  Thomas's 
Hospital. 

Presently  after  a  gentleman  came  up  to  me,  and 
very  politely  offered  to  show  me  anything  remarkable. 
He  accompanied  me  through  the  whole  collection,  and 
afterwards  showed  me  the  room  containing  the  library 
and  preparations  illustrative  of  materia  medica. 

Mr.  Edward  W.  Nordblad,  Curator,  St.  Thomas's 
Hospital. 

The  preparations  illustrative  of  comparative  ana- 
tomy are  in  general  poor ;  many  of  them  are  decayed, 
and  the  collection  is  decidedly  contemptible.  In  the 
other  departments  the  preparations  are  in  general  good, 
but  the  objects  are  ill-arranged,  frequently  crowded  ;  in 
other  cases  the  reverse.  The  casts,  bones,  etc.,  are 
very  dirty,  and  everything  bears  the  appearance  of  an 
old  institution  as  much  in  need  of  a  radical  reform  as  a 
Scotch  burgh.  It  seems  astonishing  that  the  principle 
of  emulation  should  not  operate  here,  the  Museum  of 


124 

the  neighbouring  and  rival  institutions  being  compara- 
tively so  splendid. 

The  curator  informed  me  that  there  are  too  few 
hands  employed — himself,  an  assistant,  and  a  person  for 
cleaning ;  whereas  in  Guy's  there  are  the  curator,  an 
assistant,  another  person  for  cleaning  and  drudgery,  a 
man  for  preparing  skeletons,  and  a  modeller  who  does 
nothing  else.  In  the  Edinburgh  Museum  there  is  a 
conservator,  who  does  all  the  work,  or  pays  for  having  it 
done.  This  also  needs  reform,  seeing  the  establishment 
is  more  extensive  than  either  St.  Thomas's  or  Guy's. 

Some  people  make  a  mighty  blowing,  and  look  as  if 
they  had  discovered  a  mare's  nest  when  they  find  a 
preparation  from  which  the  spirit  has  partially  evapor- 
ated. Let  them  learn  that  in  the  Museum  of  St. 
Thomas's  Hospital,  in  the  county  of  Surrey,  there  lies 
the  half  of  a  human  body  dissected,  together  with  a 
brain,  enclosed  in  an  air-tight  glass  case,  with  about  one 
inch  of  spirits  in  the  bottom.  The  vapour  is  sufficient 
to  keep  the  articles  in  perfect  preservation.  The  fact, 
however,  has  long  been  known  to  me. 

As  I  have  already  remarked,  it  is  of  little  importance 
what  arrangement  is  adopted,  provided  it  be  simple, 
perspicuous,  with  Jew  primary  divisions. 

Leaving  St.  Thomas's  I  recrossed  the  river  by 
London  Bridge,  carrying  with  me  specimens  of  the 
oolite  of  which  the  old  London  Bridge  was  built.  I 
then  went  in  search  of  Mr.  Scott,  my  publisher. 


JOURNAL  125 

Well,  in  the  first  place,  as  he  is  newly  set  up,  his 
name  is  not  in  the  Directory,  so  I  went  to  the  old 
establishment  of  Dove,  with  whom  he  was  in  Piccadilly, 
No.  178.     The  shop  untenanted.     Called  at  next  door. 
The  people  there  knew  nothing  of  Scott,  but  directed 
me  for  Dove,  to  Wigmore  Street,  where  again  I  was 
directed  to  Bartlett's  Buildings.     When  I  came  to  the 
end  of  Oxford   Street,  where   they  were  said  to  be, 
nobody  knew  anything  of  them.     One  person  said  he 
had  seen  such  a  place,  but  could  not  tell  where.     Being 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  Soho  Square,  I  entered  it,  and 
found  in  a  corner   the  Linnean   Society's  Rooms — 5 
o'clock — shut.     However,  the  servant  showed  me  them. 
The    apartments   are  not   suitable,    being  those   of  a 
common  dwelling-house.     The  collections  consist  of — 
the  Linnean  herbarium,  Sir  James  Smith's  herbarium, 
an   East    India   collection   of   plants,    birds    of   New 
Holland,   various    quadrupeds    and    birds,    and    other 
objects.     The  plants  are  fastened  upon  strong  bluish- 
white  paper  of  large  size.     There  is  also  a  good  library. 
The  hall  for  meetings  rather  shabby.      Entomological 
collection  well.      I  then  returned  towards  St.  Paul's, 
and  went  to  31  Poultry,  which  was  tenanted  by  a  book- 
seller from  Banff,  a  Mr.  Cowie,  to  whom  I  was  intro- 
duced by  Dr.  Barclay  eleven  years  ago.     He  is  dead, 
his  wife  married  to  his  successor  in  trade,  who  retains 
the  name,  in  this  manner — Cowie  and  Co.     By  the  by, 
I  saw  in  Gracechurch  Street  to-day  a  curious  instance 
of  this  kind,  viz.  Stone,  late  Flint.     A  person  in  the  shop 
gave  me  Scott's  direction,  viz. — Scott  and  Webster,  36 


126  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

Charterhouse  Square,  nr.  West  Smithfield.  By  this  time, 
however,  it  was  rather  late,  and  I  was  rather  fatigued, 
so  I  thought  I  should  rather  return  to  Aldermansbury. 
In  a  letter  from  Edinburgh  I  am  directed  to  get 
from  J.  Simpson,  stock  manufacturer,  166  Strand,  South 
Side,  a  military  stock,  purchased  by  Kenneth  MacCas- 
kill,  assistant  surgeon,  1st  Foot,  on  10th  September. 
I  have  reached  the  Strand;  but  in  166  is  a  person 
named  Whitelsock,  and  in  106  are  Widow  Dyke  and 
Son,  quill  manufacturers  to  His  Majesty ;  and  Simpson 
I  find  nowhere.  However,  I  have  done  my  duty. 
There  remain  for  me  now — 

To  see  Heaviside's  Museum. 

To  deliver  Mr.  Coleman's  letter. 

To  see  Mr.  Scott. 

To  call  on  Mr.  Linning. 

To  visit  Mr.  MacCulloch. 

To  pack  up  my  movables. 

To  pay  my  debts. 

To  take  a  seat  in  or  on  a  coach,  and  to  leave  London. 

It  seems  a  little  strange  to  a  stranger  that  in  London 
nobody  knows  anybody,  excepting  those  that  it  especially 
concerns  him  to  know.  This  is  true  Irish,  but  at 
bottom  correct.  In  Edinburgh  everybody  knows  every- 
body with  whom  he  has  nothing  to  do,  and  his  neigh- 
bour's affairs  are  of  much  interest  to  him,  especially  if 
he  has  no  business  with  them.  In  Scotland  a  man  is 
nothing  unless  he  has  a  long  string  of  ancestors,  in 
England  nothing  unless  he  has  a  long  purse.  A 
Londoner  does  not  inquire  respecting  the  man  who 


JOURNAL  127 

occupied  his  shop  last  year,  nor  does  he  care  who  lives 
next  door  to  him — and  why  should  he  ?  He  cannot 
direct  a  stranger  beyond  the  street  in  which  he  resides, 
and  confesses  that  he  has  not  seen  the  interior  of  St. 
Paul's  or  the  Colosseum.  He  cannot  tell  whence  comes 
the  stone  with  which  the  street  is  paved,  or  how  the 
bricks  are  made  of  which  his  house  is  built.  He  is  not 
aware  of  the  rapid  decomposition  of  the  oolite  of  which 
the  public  buildings  are  formed,  nor  does  he  consider 
that  while  streets  in  London  are  thrown  down  and  re- 
built every  fifty  years,  those  of  Aberdeen  last  for 
centuries.  London  to  him  is  the  world,  and  all  beyond 
is  extramundane.  Now  all  this,  and  much  more,  arises 
simply  from  circumstances ;  and  Dr.  MacCulloch,  who 
accuses  the  Hebridians  of  want  of  skill  in  agriculture, 
speaks  as  foolishly  as  I  should  do  were  I  to  accuse  the 
Londoners  of  want  of  observation. 

Thursday. 

The  principal  business  transacted  to-day  was  the 
inspection  of  the  Museum  of  Mr.  Langstaff,  surgeon, 
Basinghall  Street.  It  is  contained  in  a  small  building 
at  the  back  of  his  house,  and  in  two  apartments  of  the 
latter.  He  says  there  are  upwards  of  7000  articles. 
The  pathological  collection  is  excellent  and,  according 
to  his  account,  the  case  of  every  preparation  is 
accurately  detailed.  In  comparative  anatomy  there 
is  a  very  considerable  series.  He  has  also  a  great 
number  of  reptiles  and  insects  in  good  condition. 
The  morbid  structures  are  excellent.  The  skeletons 


128  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

are  not  numerous,  nor  are  they  kept  in  good  con- 
dition. Skulls  of  mammifera  rather  numerous,  but 
not  remarkably  fine.  There  is  a  good  series  of 
national  skulls.  Mr.  Langstaff  is  disposed  to  part 
with  his  collection.  He  says  he  does  not  exactly 
know  its  value,  but  thinks  it  may  be  worth  from 
£6000  to  £7000.  I  imagine,  speaking  vaguely,  that 
it  may  be  worth  £2000.  It  seems  to  be  more 
extensive  than  the  Bell  collection  purchased  by  the 
Edinburgh  College  of  Surgeons ;  but  unless  the 
articles  were  laid  out  so  as  to  be  properly  seen,  one 
cannot  judge  with  accuracy. 

CARLISLE,  Saturday  night. 

On  Thursday  evening,  at  a  quarter  from  six,  I  left 
London  by  coach,  said  to  be  for  Edinburgh,  after  pay- 
ing £4 :  Is.  for  transportation,  and  proceeded  in  the 
direction  of  Manchester,  where  I  arrived  at  four  on 
the  afternoon  of  Friday.  The  night  was  exceedingly 
beautiful,  the  temperature  being  moderate,  the 
atmospheric  current  gentle,  the  moon  bright,  and 
the  stars  scintillating  in  their  usual  manner.  I  saw 
three  falling  stars,  one  of  them  nearly  as  large  as 
Jupiter.  From  three  to  six  in  the  morning,  however, 
the  cold  was  so  great  that  I  was  almost  benumbed. 
A  moonlight  ride  in  England  is  pleasant  enough. 
The  numerous  pretty  towns  and  villages  through 
which  we  passed,  the  gentle  character  of  the  scenery, 
the  placidity  of  the  night,  the  sense  of  security,  and 
the  rapidity  of  motion,  conspired  to  render  the  transit 


JOURNAL  129 

agreeable.  The  celerity  with  which  the  change  of 
horses  was  effected  was  admirable,  but  nothing  of 
any  importance  occurred  on  the  journey.  The  country 
was  flat,  or  very  slightly  undulated,  until  we  came 
to  Derbyshire,  where  hills  of  considerable  elevation 
presented  themselves.  The  white  mist  that  covered 
the  lowest  grounds  along  our  course  seemed  at  a 
little  distance  like  a  sheet  of  water,  for  which  I  at 
first  took  it.  The  first  light  of  the  morning  sun 
showed  the  herbage  covered  with  hoar  frost.  A  short 
delay  caused  by  a  refractory  horse,  which  had  to  be 
changed,  enabled  the  passengers  to  get  out  and  walk 
about  a  mile,  which  had  a  good  effect  in  restoring  our 
limbs  to  their  natural  state.  At  the  Royal  Hotel 
in  Manchester  I  had  a  most  refreshing  sleep  of 
eight  hours'  continuance,  after  which  I  was  awakened 
by  the  pain  of  some  bug -bites  on  the  neck  and 
back. 

We  left  Manchester  at  half-past  five,  and  arrived 
here  at  nine.  It  rained  more  or  less  heavily  the  whole 
day,  but  the  temperature  was  mild,  and  I  experienced 
very  little  inconvenience.  The  first  part  of  our 
journey  was  not  interesting,  the  country  being  flat, 
and  disfigured  by  brick  towns  and  manufactories  ;  but  a 
change  soon  came  over  the  scene,  and  from  Lancaster 
to  this  place  the  country  is  hilly  and  even  moun- 
tainous. The  geological  phenomena  observed  were 
interesting,  although,  of  course,  imperfectly  observed. 
During  the  night,  from  London  to  Derby,  I  could 
only  see  that  the  country  was  secondary,  consisting 

K 


130  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

of  clays  and  lias.  In  Derbyshire  I  saw  amygdaloid, 
carboniferous  limestone,  millstone  -  grit,  and  other 
secondary  rocks.  To-day  the  rocks  seen  were 
carboniferous  limestone,  sandstones  of  several  forma- 
tions, a  splendid  mountain  of  the  first  secondary 
limestone  beyond  Kendal,  mountains  of  a  kind  of 
slate  intermediate  between  clay  slate  and  compact 
felspar.  With  respect  to  botany,  I  could  not  mark 
much  of  any  importance.  Inula  dysentenca,  Sangui- 
sorba  officinalis,  Convolvulus  sepium,  etc. 

Between  Kendal  and  Shap  is  a  track  of  high 
ground,  covered  with  peat  and  heather,  as  wild  as 
any  that  I  have  seen  in  the  Highlands  or  Hebrides. 

EDINBURGH. 

At  Carlisle  I  slept  nearly  four  hours.  It  had 
rained  heavily  during  the  night,  and  when  I  arose 
at  four,  it  still  continued.  Breakfast  was  on  the 
table  in  the  coffee-room,  and  after  appropriating  to 
myself  a  moderate  quantity  of  it,  I  ascended  the 
Edinburgh  mail,  to  which  I  had  transferred  myself 
by  paying  7d.  additional.  The  distance  to  Edinburgh 
is  96  miles,  and  we  arrrived  there  at  half-past  three. 
At  the  head  of  the  Solway  Firth  the  land  is  alluvial 
and  almost  perfectly  flat,  enclosed  by  hedges,  generally 
without  trees  in  them,  contrary  to  the  English 
practice.  On  coming  to  the  Esk  we  passed  for  several 
miles  along  that  river,  crossing  and  recrossing  it 
several  times.  The  scenery  was  perfectly  Scottish — 
that  is  to  say,  the  fields  large,  the  trees  left  to  assume 


JOURNAL  131 

their  natural  forms,  the  hedges  trim,  the  houses  built 
of  stone,  the  heights  covered  with  trees,  the  hills  bare 
and  heathy.  The  river  tumbled,  and  rushed,  and  shot 
silently  along,  or  curled  into  eddies  as  it  proceeded  in 
its  winding  course  between  its  lofty  banks,  which  were 
often  precipitous,  and  generally  covered  with  trees 
and  shrubs.  Nothing  half  so  beautiful  occurred 
between  London  and  Scotland.  At  length  the  road 
left  the  river  and  passed  by  one  of  its  tributaries,  until 
we  ascended  far  among  the  high  green  hills  of  transi- 
tion slate,  covered  here  and  there  with  brown  fern. 
After  passing  through  a  long,  narrow,  bare  glen,  we 
entered  another,  the  streamlet  of  which  flowed  east- 
wards to  join  the  Tweed.  Cultivation  increased  as 
we  proceeded,  the  country  became  more  wooded,  and 
as  we  approached  Hawick,  the  valley  opened.  From 
that  place  to  Selkirk  the  ground  is  high  and  bleak, 
but  partially  cultivated.  The  rock  was  everywhere 
greywacke  and  slate.  From  Selkirk  to  Galashiels  the 
road  passes  along  the  bottom  of  the  valley  of  the 
united  Yarrow  and  Ettrick  streams — Abbotsford  on 
the  south  side  of  the  Tweed — Melrose  obscurely  seen 
at  a  distance.  The  valley  of  the  Gala  is  not  remark- 
able, excepting  towards  its  lower  part,  where  it  is 
wooded  and  partially  cultivated.  The  hills  are  stony 
and  bare,  and  although  in  many  places  cultivation 
extends  far  up  the  secondary  valleys,  the  ground  is 
scarcely  anywhere  sheltered  by  hedges  or  trees,  which 
would  certainly  be  of  decided  advantage.  From  this 
to  the  neighbourhood  of  Dalkeith  the  ground  is  high, 


132  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

heathy,  destitute  of  wood,  and  but  slightly  cultivated. 
There  is,  however,  a  very  extensive  tract  of  good, 
slightly  sloping  ground  on  the  edge  of  the  hilly 
district  that  is  capable  of  yielding  crops  or  woods. 
As  you  come  over  the  ridge,  you  see  in  succes- 
sion the  Fifeshire  Lomonds,  the  Pentland  Hills,  and 
Arthur's  Seat.  I  observed  that  beyond  Dalkeith  the 
roads  are  repaired  with  a  blue  limestone,  seemingly 
of  the  carboniferous  series,  but  presenting  appear- 
ances differing  considerably  from  any  variety  that  I 
have  seen.

EXTRACTS     FROM     PROFESSOR     MACGILLIVRAY'S 

WORKS    EXPLANATORY     OF     HIS     SYSTEM     OF    ORNI- 
THOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION    AS    DIFFERING    FROM 

THOSE   OF   OTHER    ORNITHOLOGISTS. 

1. 

THE  object  which  I  had  in  view  when,  many  years  ago, 
I  commenced  the  observations  recorded  in  this  work 
was  at  some  convenient  season  to  lay  before  the  public 
descriptions  of  the  birds  of  Great  Britain,  more  extended, 
and  if  possible  more  correct,  than  any  previously  offered. 
To  accomplish  so  ambitious  a  purpose,  I  judged  it  neces- 
sary to  direct  my  attention  to  the  living  objects  them- 
selves, rather  than  to  their  skins  in  collections  or  their 
portraits  in  books ;  to  follow  them  in  their  haunts, 
observe  their  manners,  procure  unmutilated  specimens, 
carefully  examine  all  their  parts,  and  thus  be  enabled  to 
bring  forward  facts  that  had  been  entirely  overlooked, 
and  place  others  in  a  light  in  which  they  had  not  pre- 
viously been  viewed.  Short  specific  characters,  slight 
descriptions  or  notices,  and  measurements  of  parts,  I 
could  easily  have  obtained  by  visiting  museums  and 


ORNITHOLOGICAL   CLASSIFICATION    135 

consulting  books ;  but  the  elaboration  of  a  detailed 
account  of  the  species,  such  as  is  to  be  found  in  the 
following  pages,  could  obviously  be  accomplished  only 
by  much  labour  of  a  different  kind. — British  Birds, 
vol.  i.,  Preface. 

2. 

In  again  presenting  to  the  public  some  of  the  results 
of  my  long-continued  examination  of  the  habits  and 
structure  of  the  birds  of  Great  Britain,  I  may  be  per- 
mitted to  offer  a  few  retrospective  remarks.  The 
introduction  to  the  first  volume  contains,  among  other 
matter,  a  description  of  the  skeleton,  the  organs  of 
flight,  and  the  digestive  apparatus  of  birds,  rendered 
necessary  by  the  neglect  of  anatomy  evinced  by  our 
most  esteemed  ornithological  writers,  who  in  their 
treatises  have  either  expressly  maintained,  or  practically 
shown  it  to  be  their  opinion  that  the  inspection  of  the 
external  parts  is  a  sufficient  guide  to  zoological  know- 
ledge. In  avoiding  this  error,  as  I  cannot  but  esteem 
it,  I  have  not  fallen  into  the  opposite  one  of  considering 
an  acquaintance  with  the  internal  structure  of  animals 
alone  necessary  to  their  historian,  but  have  entered 
into  details  as  to  external  form,  and  the  texture  and 
colours  of  the  cutaneous  system,  much  more  extended, 
and,  if  my  efforts  have  been  successful,  not  less  accurate, 
than  those  which  I  have  met  with  in  any  of  the  works 
alluded  to,  and  have  presented  numerous  facts  relative 
to  the  habits  and  economy  of  the  different  species. 


136  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

The  varieties  exhibited  in  the  mode  of  flying,  the 
differences  of  manners,  the  dispersion  and  migration  of 
birds,  were  introduced  to  notice  in  chapters  intervening 
between  the  methodical  descriptions  of  the  orders  under 
which  I  thought  it  expedient  to  arrange  the  species. 
In  recalling  these  circumstances  to  mind,  my  object  is 
simply  to  connect  the  past  with  the  present,  and  direct 
the  attention  of  the  reader  to  the  continuity  of  plan 
and  similarity  of  execution  exhibited  by  the  two 
volumes ;  not  certainly  to  boast  of  my  performances, 
which  I  am  convinced  require  not  a  little  of  that  kind 
of  indulgence  which  the  candid  and  considerate  critic  is 
always  ready  to  apply  to  the  productions  of  an  artist 
who  honestly  and  earnestly,  although  not  always  success- 
fully, strives  to  represent  Nature  as  she  appears  to  him. 
In  the  present  work,  as  in  others,  and  in  all  my 
papers  published  in  various  journals,  I  have  endeavoured 
to  adapt  the  style  to  the  subject,  rendering  it  compact 
and  precise  when  engaged  with  technical  descriptions, 
copious  and  florid  when  treating  of  the  actions  and 
haunts  of  birds,  abrupt  or  continuous,  direct  or  discur- 
sive, harsh  or  harmonious,  according  to  the  varying 
circumstances  of  the  case.  My  aim  has  been  to  amuse 
as  well  as  to  instruct,  to  engage  the  affections  as  well  as 
to  enlighten  the  understanding,  to  induce  the  traveller 
on  the  road  to  science  to  make  occasional  excursions, 
tending  to  raise  his  spirits,  and  to  show  to  the  public 
that  ornithology  is  not  necessarily  so  repulsive  as 
some  of  its  votaries  represent  it. — British  Birds,  vol  ii.,

3. 

Several  keen  observers  of  birds  have,  to  my  sure 
knowledge,  received  from  the  information  conveyed  in 
these  volumes  an  impulse  which  will  effectually  prevent 
them  from  ever  perverting  Nature  by  forcing  her  into 
quinary  or  ternary  arrangements,  or  from  dwindling 
into  mere  describers  of  skins,  and  indiscriminating  com- 
pilers of  correct,  doubtful,  and  erroneous  observations. 
Of  such  pupils  I  am  proud,  and  if  my  exultation  should 
be  held  as  an  indication  of  vanity,  I  cannot  help  it,  for 
1  am  constrained  to  speak  the  truth.  Should  any  man 
conceive  himself  injured  thereby,  I  hope  he  may  con- 
sider that  in  matters  of  science  there  ought  to  be  perfect 
freedom  of  thought,  and  that  a  very  obscure  individual 
like  myself  may  sometimes  fall  upon  truths  subversive 
of  theories  invented  by  men  of  the  highest  intellect. — 
British  Birds,  vol.  iii.,  Preface.

It  seems  difficult  to  conjecture  why  the  vultures 
should  be,  properly  speaking,  destitute  of  inferior  larynx. 
What  is  there  in  their  voice  or  respiration  that  renders 
an  inferior  laryngeal  muscle,  or  a  division  of  the  last 
tracheal  ring,  inexpedient?  Such  questions  tend  to 
show  that  much  remains  to  be  studied  in  the  anatomy 
and  physiology  of  birds. 

Observations  like  these  may  appear  unnecessary  to 


138  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

the  persons  who  view  birds  merely  as  composed  of  skin 
and  feathers ;  but  to  them  I  now  cease  from  addressing 
myself.  They  will  gradually  disappear  from  the  earth, 
and  their  place  will  be  occupied  by  men  who  will  study 
birds  as  organic  beings.  The  attempt  which  I  have 
made  to  establish  a  rational  method  of  study  in  this 
most  interesting  department  of  science,  however  feeble 
it  may  be,  will  yet  form,  I  am  well  persuaded,  the  com- 
mencement of  a  new  era  among  my  countrymen,  whom 
I  hope  yet  to  see  perfecting  my  favourite  study  to  such 
a  degree  as  to  render  these  volumes  antiquated  and 
effete.  For  my  own  part,  I  am  well  pleased  to  think 
that  my  labours,  however  little  appreciated  by  such  of 
my  contemporaries  as  evidently  conceive  themselves  to 
be  the  sole  depositaries  of  ornithological  knowedge,  will 
be  productive  of  beneficial  results,  inasmuch  as  they  will 
stimulate  to  increased  exertion  some  of  those  young  and 
ardent  naturalists  who,  to  my  certain  knowledge,  have 
derived  pleasure  from  even  the  rude  attempt  at  observa- 
tion of  so  humble  an  individual  as  myself. — British 
Birds,  vol.  iii.  p.  159.

Each  of  our  many  ornithologists,  real  and  pretended, 
has  a  method  of  his  own  :  one  confining  himself  to  short 
technical  descriptions  as  most  useful  to  students ; 
another  detailing  more  especially  the  habits  of  the 
birds  as  more  amusing  to  general  readers  ;  a  third  view- 
ing them  in  relation  to  human  feelings  and  passion ;  a 


ORNITHOLOGICAL   CLASSIFICATION    139 

fourth  converting  science  into  romance,  and  giving  no 
key  to  the  discrimination  of  the  species,  bringing  his 
little  knowledge  of  the  phenomena  under  the  dominion 
of  imagination,  and  copiously  intermingling  his  patch- 
work of  truth  and  error  with  scraps  of  poetry.  The 
plan  of  this  work  is  very  different  from  that  of  any  of 
these,  and  is  not  by  any  means  calculated  to  amuse  the 
reader  who  desires  nothing  more  than  pleasant  anec- 
dotes or  fanciful  combinations,  or  him  who  merely 
wishes  to  know  a  species  by  name.  It  contains  the 
only  full  and  detailed  technical  descriptions  hitherto 
given  in  this  country.  The  habits  of  the  species  are 
treated  of  with  equal  extension  in  every  case  where  I 
have  been  enabled  to  study  them  advantageously.  The 
internal  structure  has  been  explained  in  so  far  as  I  have 
thought  it  expedient  to  endeavour  to  bring  it  into  view, 
and  in  particular  the  alimentary  organs,  as  determining 
and  illustrating  the  habits,  have  been  carefully  attended 
to.  If  imagination  has  sometimes  been  permitted  to 
interfere,  it  has  only  been  in  disposing  ascertained  facts 
so  as  to  present  an  agreeable  picture,  or  to  render  them 
easily  intelligible  by  placing  them  in  relation  to  each 
other. — British  Birds,  vol.  v.,  Preface.

EXTRACTS  FROM  PROFESSOR  MACGILLIVRAY'S 
WORKS  DESCRIPTIVE  OF  BIRD  LIFE,  OF 
PERSONAL  ADVENTURE  FOR  SCIENTIFIC  IN- 
VESTIGATION, OR  OF  PICTURESQUE  SCENES,  ETC. 

1. — A  NIGHT  EXCURSION  TO  THE  WELLS  OF  DEE. 

IT  is  pleasant  to  hear  the  bold  challenge  of  the  gor- 
cock  at  early  dawn  on  the  wild  moor  remote  from 
human  habitation,  where,  however,  few  ornithologists 
have  ever  listened  to  it.  I  remember  with  delight 
the  cheering  influence  of  its  cry  on  a  cold  morning 
in  September,  when,  wet  to  the  knees,  and  with  a 
sprained  ankle,  I  had  passed  the  night  in  a  peat  bog 
in  the  midst  of  the  Grampians,  between  the  sources 
of  the  Tummel  and  the  Dee.  Many  years  ago,  when 
I  was  of  opinion,  as  I  still  am,  that  there  is  little 
pleasure  in  passing  through  life  dry-shod  and  ever 
comfortable,  I  was  returning  to  Aberdeen  from  a 
botanical  excursion  through  the  Hebrides  and  the 
south  of  Scotland.  At  Blair  Atholl  I  was  directed  to  a 
road  that  leads  over  the  hill,  and  which  I  was  informed 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  141 

was  much  shorter  than  the  highway.  By  it  I  pro- 
ceeded until  I  reached  Blair  Lodge,  where  I  obtained 
some  refreshment,  of  which  I  stood  greatly  in  need. 
The  good  woman  very  benevolently  exerted  herself 
to  persuade  me  to  remain  all  night,  the  hills  being,  as 
she  said,  bleak  and  dreary,  entirely  destitute  of  every- 
thing that  could  afford  pleasure  to  a  traveller,  and  even 
without  human  habitation,  the  nearest  house  being 
fifteen  miles  north.  It  was  now  six  o'clock,  and  I  was 
certain  of  being  benighted,  but  I  had  promised  to  be 
at  the  source  of  the  Dee  by  noon  of  next  day,  and  all 
the  dragons  of  darkness  could  not  have  prevented  me 
from  at  least  striving  to  fulfil  my  engagement.  They 
had  never  heard  of  the  spring  in  question,  nor  even 
of  the  river ;  no  Cairngorm  could  be  seen,  and  a 
woman  just  arrived  from  the  Spey  informed  me  that 
I  should  be  under  the  necessity  of  going  through 
Badenoch  before  I  could  get  to  it.  I  placed  more 
confidence  in  my  travelling  map.  All,  however,  shook 
their  heads  when  I  disclosed  my  plan,  which  was  to 
proceed  eastward,  cross  a  stream,  get  to  the  summit 
of  a  ridge  of  mountains,  and  so  forth,  until  I  should 
reach  the  first  burn  of  the  Dee,  where  I  expected 
to  find  my  friend  Craigie.  It  was  sunset  when  I 
got  to  the  top  of  the  first  hill,  whence  I  struck 
directly  east,  judging  by  the  place  where  the  sun 
disappeared  behind  the  rugged  and  desolate  mountains. 
After  traversing  a  mile  of  boggy  heath,  I  found  myself 
put  out  of  my  course  by  a  long,  deep,  rocky  valley  or 
ravine  which  I  was  obliged  to  double,  and  before  I 


142 

had    accomplished    this   night    fell.       I    travelled   on, 
however,  about  two  miles  farther,  and  coming  upon 
another  but  smaller  valley,  in  which  I  was  apprehensive 
of  breaking  my  neck  if  1  should  venture  through  it,  I 
sat  down  by  a  rock,  weary,  and  covered  with  perspira- 
tion.    Rest  is  pleasant,  even  in  such  a  place  as  this ; 
and  when  I  had  experienced  a  little  of  its  sweets,  I 
resolved  to  take  up   my  abode   there   for   the   night. 
So,  thrusting  my  stick  into  the  peat  between  me  and 
the  ravine  below,  I  extended  myself  on  the  ground  and 
presently  fell  into   a  reverie,   reviewed  my  life,  gave 
vent  to  the  sorrow  of  my  soul  in  a  thousand  reflections 
on  the  folly  of  my  conduct,  and  ended  with  resolving 
to  amend !     Around  me  were  the  black  masses  of  the 
granite   hills   rising  to  heaven  like  the  giant  barriers 
of    an    enchanted    land ;    above,    the    cloudless    sky, 
spangled  with  stars ;  beneath,  a  cold  bed  of  wet  turf ; 
within,  a  human  spirit  tortured  with  wild  imaginings 
and  the  pangs  of  a  sprained  foot.     "  In  such  a  place, 
at  such  a  time,"  and  in  such  a  mood,  what  are  the 
vanities  of  the  world,  the  pomp  of  power,  the  pride 
of  renown,   and  even   the  pleasures   of  bird-nesting ! 
Having  in  a  short  time  become  keenly  sensible  that 
a  great  portion  of  vital  heat  had  oozed  out  of  me,  I 
looked  out  for  a  warmer  situation  ;  but,  alas,  with  little 
success  ;  for  although  I  pulled  some  stunted  heath  and 
white  moss,  with  which  I  covered  my  feet,  and  laid  me 
down  by  another  crag   that  afforded  more  shelter,   I 
could  not  sleep.     After  a  while,  having  experienced  a 
fit  of  shivering,  I  got  up  to  gather  more  heath,  with 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  143 

which  I  formed  a  sort  of  bed  and  lay  down  again. 
But  even  heath  was  not  to  be  obtained  in  sufficient 
quantity,  so  that  for  a  covering  I  was  obliged  to  bury 
myself  in  moss  and  turf,  with  the  soil  adhering.  At 
long,  long  length,  the  sky  began  to  brighten  in  what 
I  supposed  to  be  the  north-east,  and  I  was  anxiously 
looking  for  the  approach  of  morn,  when  gradually  the 
pale  unwelcome  moon  rose  over  a  distant  hill.  It  was 
piercing  cold,  and  I  perceived  that  a  strolling  naturalist, 
however  fervid  his  temperament,  could  hardly,  if 
scantily  clad,  feel  comfortable  even  among  moss,  in 
a  bog  of  the  Grampians.  What  a  blessing  a  jug  of 
hot  water  would  have  been  to  such  a  stomach  as  mine, 
aching  with  emptiness,  and  nothing,  not  even  tripe-de- 
roche,  to  be  got  to  thrust  into  it.  However,  morning 
actually  came  at  last,  and  I  started  up  to  renew  my 
journey.  It  was  now  that  I  got  a  view  of  my  lodging, 
which  was  an  amphitheatre  formed  of  bare  craggy 
hills,  covered  with  fragments  of  stone  and  white  moss 
and  separated  by  patches  of  peat  bog.  Not  a  house 
was  to  be  seen,  nor  a  sheep,  nor  even  a  tree,  nor  so 
much  as  a  blade  of  green  grass.  Not  a  vestige  of  life 
can  be  found  here,  thought  I ;  but  I  was  reproved  by 
a  cry  that  startled  me.  The  scarlet  crest  and  bright 
eye  of  a  moor-cock  were  suddenly  protruded  from  a 
tuft  of  heather,  and  I  heard  with  delight  the  well-known 
kok,  kok  of  the  "blessed  bird,"  as  the  Highlanders 
call  him.  It  was  a  good  omen  ;  the  night  and  dulness 
had  fled,  and  I  limped  along  as  cheerily  as  I  could. 
My  half-frozen  blood  soon  regained  its  proper  tempera-

ture ;  ere  long  I  reached  the  base  of  the  rocky 
ridge,  and  after  passing  some  hills,  traversing  a  long 
valley,  and  ascending  a  mountain  of  considerable 
height,  I  took  out  my  map,  and  looking  eastward 
below  me,  saw,  to  my  great  satisfaction,  a  rivulet 
running  for  several  miles  directly  in  the  course 
marked.  I  was  assured  that  this  stream,  whether  the 
source  or  not,  ran  into  the  Dee,  as  it  proceeded  east- 
ward, and  therefore  I  directed  my  steps  toward  it. 
But  here,  too,  a  scene  occurred  which  gave  me  great 
pleasure.  Some  low  croaking  sounds  came  from 
among  the  stones  around  me,  and  presently  after  a 
splendid  flock  of  grey  ptarmigans,  about  fifty  in 
number,  rose  into  the  air  and  whirred  past  me  on  their 
way  to  the  opposite  eminence.  On  the  brow  of  the 
hill  I  found  two  large  fountains,  the  sources  of  the 
stream  below,  of  each  of  which  I  drank  a  mouthful, 
and  proceeded.  My  friend,  however,  was  not  to  be 
seen  ;  but  it  was  too  early ;  and  so  to  pass  the  time  I 
explored  another  of  the  sources  of  the  rivulet  that  rose 
farther  up  in  the  glen.  But  at  length  the  scene  be- 
came too  dreary  to  be  endured  :  desolate  mountains,  on 
whose  rugged  sides  lay  patches  of  snow  that  the 
summer's  suns  had  failed  to  melt ;  wild  glens,  scantily 
covered  with  coarse  grass,  heath,  and  lichens ;  dark 
brown  streams  gushing  among  crags  and  blocks,  un- 
enlivened even  by  a  clump  of  stunted  willows :  and  I 
followed  the  rivulet,  judging  that  it  would  lead  to  the 
river,  and  the  river  to  the  sea.  For  seven  long  miles  1 
trudged  along,  faint  enough,  as  you  may  suppose,  hav-

ing  obtained  no  refreshment  for  eighteen  hours,  except- 
ing two   mouthfuls  of  cold  water ;   so  that  even  the 
multitudes  of  grouse  that  sprung  up  around  me  ceased 
to  give  much  pleasure,  although  I   had  never  before 
started  so  many,  even  with  a  dog,  in  a  space  of  equal 
extent.     At  one  o'clock,  however,  I  came  to  a  hut, 
tenanted  by  a  person  named  MacHardy,  who,  express- 
ing  his   concern    at   my   having   been   out   all   night, 
treated  me  to  a  glass  of  whisky  and  some  bread  and 
milk.     At  this  place,  Dubrach,  stood  three  half-blasted 
firs,  and  about  a  mile  and  a  half  farther  down  I  came 
upon   a  wood,  the  first  that   I  had  seen  since  I  left 
Blair.     The  silver  Dee  now  rolled  pleasantly  along  the 
wooded  valley,  and  in  the  evening  I  reached  Castleton 
of  Braemar,  where,  while  seated  in  the  inn,  at  a  little 
round  table,  reading  Zimmerman  on  Solitude,  which,  to 
my  great  joy,  I  had  found  there,  and  sipping  my  tea, 
I  heard  a  rap  at  the  door.     "  Come  in,"  said  I ;  it  was 
my  best  friend,  with  whom  I  spent  a  happy  evening, 
in    which,    I    believe,    little    mention    was    made    of 
ptarmigans,   grey    or   brown. — British    Birds,    vol.    i.

2. — MOUNTAIN  INSPIRATION. 

It  is  delightful  to  wander  far  away  from  the  haunts 
and  even  the  solitary  huts  of  men,  and,  ascending  the 
steep  mountain,  seat  one's  self  on  the  ruinous  cairn  that 
crowns  its  summit,  where,  amid  the  grey  stones,  the 
ptarmigan  gleans  its  Alpine  food.  There,  communing 

i, 


146  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

with  his  own  heart,  in  the  wilderness,  the  lover  of  Nature 
cannot  fail  to  look  up  to  Nature's  God.  I  believe  it  in 
fact  impossible,  in  such  a  situation,  on  the  height  of 
Ben-na-muic-dhui  or  Ben  Nevis,  for  example,  not  to  be 
sensible,  not  merely  of  the  existence  but  also  of  the 
presence  of  a  Divinity.  In  that  sacred  temple,  of  which 
the  everlasting  hills  are  the  pillars,  and  the  blue  vault 
of  heaven  the  dome,  he  must  be  a  fiend  indeed  who 
could  harbour  an  unholy  thought.  But,  to  know  himself, 
one  must  go  there  alone.  Accompanied  by  his  fellows, 
he  may  see  all  of  external  Nature  that  he  could  see  in 
solitude,  but  the  hidden  things  of  his  own  heart  will  not 
be  brought  to  light.  To  me  the  ascent  of  a  lofty 
mountain  has  always  induced  a  frame  of  mind  similar 
to  that  inspired  by  entering  a  temple ;  and  I  cannot  but 
look  upon  it  as  a  gross  profanation  to  enact  in  the  midst 
of  the  sublimities  of  creation  a  convivial  scene,  such  as 
is  usually  got  up  by  parties  from  our  large  towns,  who 
seem  to  have  no  higher  aim  in  climbing  to  the  top  of 
Ben  Lomond  or  Ben  Ledi  than  to  feast  there  upon  cold 
chicken  and  "  mountain  dew,"  and  toss  as  many  stones 
as  they  can  find  over  the  precipices. — British  Birds,  vol.

3. — FLIGHT  OF  BIRDS. 

The  folly  of  chasing  sparrows  depends  upon  the 
object  you  have  in  view.  If  the  divine  wisdom  and 
power  have  been  exercised  in  creating  them,  and  the 
good  providence  of  God  displayed  in  caring  for  them, 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  147 

it  cannot  be  foolish  in  us  to  study  their  habits,  provided 
we  look  upon  them  with  relation  to  the  author  of  their 
being.  However,  let  us  go  on :  they  have  flown,  and 
you  see  that  they  move  about  in  flocks,  that  is,  are 
gregarious  at  this  season,  as  many  species  of  small  birds 
are  in  winter,  the  lark,  for  example,  linnets,  and  buntings. 
Before  us  are  some  birds  in  the  hedge,  chaffinches,  which, 
as  you  observe,  fly  in  a  manner  somewhat  different  from 
that  of  the  sparrows.  Then,  the  rooks,  which  you  see 
high  in  the  air,  moving  steadily  and  sedately  along,  with 
regularly-timed  beats  of  their  expanded  wings,  and  now, 
as  if  seized  with  some  sudden  panic,  or  impelled  by  some 
frolicsome  propensity,  dashing  down  headlong,  crossing 
each  other,  whirling  and  undulating :  how  different  is 
their  flight  from  that  of  those  wood  pigeons,  which 
advance  with  rapidity,  moving  their  wings  with  quick 
strokes,  and  making  the  air  whistle  as  they  glide  along  ; 
while  the  two  white  gulls,  with  their  outstretched,  long, 
arched  wings,  float  buoyantly  in  the  clear  sky,  bending 
gently  to  either  side,  as  they  advance  from  the  sea. —

4. — A  LOVER  OF  NATURE — AUDUBON. 

We  are  all  school-boys,  or  at  least  scholars,  and  when 
we  forget  that  we  are  so,  we  become  fools.  If  we  go  to 
the  school  of  Nature,  and  study  God's  providence,  we 
can  be  better  employed  only  when  in  the  school  of 
revelation  we  study  God's  grace.  Let  us  ever  retain 


148  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

our  school-boy  feelings,  so  long  as  they  are  innocent. 
There  is  a  freshness  of  heart  manifest  in  every  real  lover 
of  Nature — a  delightful  feeling,  gratifying  not  to  one's 
self  only,  but  to  his  companions.  When  it  is  gone,  and 
the  frost  of  worldly  wisdom  has  chilled  the  affections, 
the  naturalist  becomes  a  pompous,  pedantic,  stiff-necked, 
cold-blooded  thing,  from  which  you  shrink  back  un- 
wittingly. I  have  the  pleasure  of  being  familiar  with 
an  ornithologist  who  has  spent  thirty  years  in  study, 
who  has  ransacked  the  steaming  swamps  of  Louisiana, 
traversed  the  tangled  and  trackless  woods  of  the  Missouri, 
ascended  the  flowery  heights  of  the  Alleghanies,  and 
clambered  among  the  desolate  crags  of  cold  and  misty 
Labrador ;  who  has  observed,  and  shot  and  drawn,  and 
described  the  birds  of  half  a  continent.  Well,  what 
then  ?  Has  this  man  the  grave  and  solemn  croak  of 
that  carrion-crow,  or  the  pertness  and  impudence  of  that 
pilfering  jackdaw.  No,  I  have  seen  him  chasing  torn-tits 
with  all  the  glee  of  a  truant  school-boy,  and  have  heard 
him  communicate  his  knowledge  with  the  fervour  and 
feeling  of  a  warm-hearted  soul,  as  he  is. — British  Birds,

5. — A  TAME  ROCK  DOVE. 

The  boys  in  the  Outer  Hebrides  often  attempt  to 
rear  young  doves,  but  their  cares  are  seldom  continued 
long  enough.  They  introduce  the  food,  dry  barley  grain, 
by  the  side  of  the  mouth,  which  occasions  inflammation 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  149 

and  swelling  of  the  basal  margins  of  the  mandibles. 
When  a  boy,  I  had  a  young  rock  dove,  which  I  fed  for 
some  time  in  this  manner,  until  the  bill  became  tumid 
and  sore,  when,  in  consequence  of  advice  from  a  friend, 
I  took  a  mouthful  of  barley  and  water,  and  introduced 
the  pigeon's  bill,  when  the  bird  soon  satisfied  itself, 
flapping  its  wings  gently  and  uttering  a  low  cry  all  the 
while.  It  grew  up  vigorously,  shed  the  yellow  down-tips 
of  its  feathers,  and  began  to  fly  about.  Towards  the 
middle  of  autumn  it  renewed  its  plumage,  and  assumed 
the  bright  and  beautiful  tints  of  the  adult  male.  When- 
ever I  escaped  from  the  detested  pages  of  Virgil  and 
Horace,  the  pigeon  was  sure  to  fly  to  me,  and  sometimes 
alighted  on  my  head  or  shoulder,  directing  its  bill  towards 
my  mouth,  and  flapping  its  wings.  Nor  did  it  ever  fly 
off  with  the  wild  pigeons,  which  almost  every  day  fed 
near  the  house,  although  it  had  no  companions  of  its 
own  species.  At  length  some  fatal  whim  induced  it  to 
make  an  excursion  to  a  village  about  a  mile  distant, 
when  it  alighted  on  the  roof  of  a  hut  and  the  boys  pelted 
it  dead  with  stones.  Long  and  true  was  my  sorrow  for 
my  lost  companion  ;  the  remembrance  of  it  will  probably 
continue  as  long  as  life.  I  have  since  mourned  the  loss 
of  a  far  dearer  dove.  They  were  gentle  and  lovely 
beings ;  but  while  the  one  has  been  blended  with  the 
elements,  the  other  remains  "  hid  with  Christ  in  God," 
and  for  it  I  "mourn  not  as  those  who  have  no  hope." —

6. — A  WINTER  BIRD  SCENE  AT  THE  MOUTH  OF 
THE  ALMOND. 

The  tide  is  out,  and  on  the  muddy  flat  at  the  mouth 
of  the  Almond  you  observe  vast  collections  of  rooks  and 
gulls.  Small  flocks  of  ducks  are  swimming  about  in  the 
stream,  and  groups  of  sandpipers  are  diligently  probing 
the  mud  along  its  edges.  Far  away,  at  a  safe  distance, 
are  many  curlews  and  oyster-catchers.  But  see,  scattered 
all  over  the  sand,  running  with  a  half-hopping  motion, 
and  as  they  rise  on  wing  displaying  the  white  of  their 
wings  and  tail,  the  beautiful  snow  buntings.  At  the 
edge  of  the  water  stand  in  a  fixed  and  watchful  posture 
a  pair  of  herons  ;  and,  out  at  sea,  are  seen  here  and  there 
a  few  dark-coloured  birds,  which  may  be  cormorants  or 
ducks.  A  flight  of  sandpipers  is  a  beautiful  sight ;  there 
they  wheel  around  the  distant  point,  and  advance  over 
the  margin  of  the  water  ;  swiftly  and  silently  they  glide 
along  ;  now,  all  inclining  their  bodies  to  one  side,  present 
to  view  their  under  surface,  glistening  in  the  sunshine ; 
again,  bending  to  the  other  side,  they  have  changed 
their  colour  to  dusky  grey ;  a  shot  is  fired,  and  they 
plunge  with  an  abrupt  turn,  curve  aside,  ascend  with  a 
gliding  flight,  and  all,  uttering  shrill  cries,  fly  over  the 
stream  to  settle  on  the  shore  that  stretches  out  towards 
Barnbogle  ruins.  I  have  seen  the  sand  fords  of  the 
Hebrides  in  autumn,  when  those  birds  descend  with  their 
broods  from  the  moors,  almost  completely  covered  with 
them  and  the  golden  plovers. 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  151 

What  interest  one  could  find  in  merely  describing 
the  skins  of  these  birds  in  his  closet,  it  is  somewhat 
difficult  to  imagine  ;  nor  is  it  obvious  that  the  examina- 
tion of  their  structure,  without  any  reference  to  their 
habits,  is  a  much  more  rational  occupation.  The  mere 
closet-naturalist,  and  the  mere  anatomist,  find  little  to 
interest  them  in  such  a  sight  as  this ;  and  the  mere 
field-naturalist,  however  delighted  with  it,  cannot  enjoy 
that  true  pleasure  which  results  from  a  knowledge  of  the 
adaptation  of  means  to  ends,  by  which  all  these  species 
have  their  peculiar  spheres  of  action  determined. — British 
Birds,  vol.  i.  pp.  301,  302. 


7. — ON  CLISHEIM  IN  A  SNOW-STORM. 

Having  in  October  1817,  as  I  find  by  one  of  my 
note-books,  left  Borve  in  Harris,  in  company  with  the 
Reverend  Mr.  Alexander  Macleod,  minister  of  the  Forest 
district,  I  crossed  the  sand  ford  and  hills  of  Luskentir 
to  the  little  Bay  of  Kindibig,  where  we  lodged  with  a 
farmer,  who  next  day  ferried  us  over  Loch  Tarbert  to  a 
place  called  Urga.  We  remained  there  for  a  night,  and 
then  continued  our  journey,  proceeding  up  a  long,  craggy, 
and  bleak  valley,  in  which  is  a  very  dark-coloured  lake, 
famous  for  a  goblin -beast  which  is  seen  upon  it  in  summer 
in  the  form  of  a  black  mass  having  three  humps.  The 
wind  was  exceedingly  keen,  the  hail  came  in  great 
showers,  and  the  summits  of  the  mountains  were  covered 
with  snow.  I  left  the  parson  a  little  above  Marig,  a 


152  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

creek  on  Loch  Seaforth,  in  which  was  his  dreary-looking 
habitation,  and  having  resolved  to  ascend  the  highest 
hill,  in  order  to  witness  a  Hebridian  snow-storm  in  all 
its  glory,  I  proceeded  towards  Clisheim,  the  height  of 
which  is  estimated  at  somewhat  more  than  three  thousand 
feet.  In  despite  of  hail  and  snow,  and  the  furious  whirl- 
winds or  eddying  blasts  that  swept  the  mountain  at 
intervals,  I  made  my  way,  though  not  without  labour, 
to  the  summit ;  and  well  was  I  recompensed,  for  there 
I  enjoyed  a  very  sublime  spectacle.  I  was  on  the  highest 
pinnacle  of  that  range  of  islands  denominated  the  Outer 
Hebrides  or  Long  Island,  perched,  like  a  ptarmigan,  on 
a  craggy  and  precipitous  ridge.  The  islands  of  Uist, 
Harris,  and  Lewis  lay,  as  it  were,  at  my  feet.  Toward 
the  east  and  south,  in  the  extreme  distance,  appeared 
the  mountains  of  the  counties  of  Ross  and  Inverness, 
with  the  pointed  hills  and  craggy  capes  and  sloping 
plains  of  Skye.  Westward,  a  long  series  of  summits, 
commencing  with  that  on  which  I  stood,  and  forming  a 
broad  ridge,  intercepted  transversely  by  deep  valleys, 
extended  for  several  miles.  They  appeared  to  be  much 
lower  than  the  mountain  on  which  I  was,  and  resembled 
heaps  of  sand  formed  by  pouring  it  from  a  vessel.  The 
snow  lay  rather  deep  on  them  all,  and  the  whirlwinds 
that  swept  along  their  ridges,  scattering  it  in  spiral  flakes, 
presented  an  indescribably  beautiful  and  sublime  appear- 
ance. I  was  enveloped  in  one,  but  it  did  not  prove  very 
boisterous.  The  Atlantic  was  covered  with  huge  clouds, 
that  advanced  in  disorderly  groups,  nearly  on  a  level 
with  my  position,  but  the  waving  streams  of  snow  and 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  153 

hail  that  poured  from  them  left  no  trace  on  the  stormy 
waters.  Toward  the  north  lay  the  dreary  flats  of  Lewis, 
covered  with  lakes  and  flanked  with  the  Park  and  Uig 
mountains.  Having  gazed  upon  the  splendid  scene  until 
nearly  frozen,  I  descended  with  considerable  difficulty 
into  a  deep  valley,  where  I  encountered  a  fall  of  snow 
so  dense  as  to  render  me  apprehensive  of  being  smothered 
by  it.  I  felt  too,  for  the  first  time  perhaps,  the  benumbing 
effects  of  cold,  my  feet  and  fingers  having  become  almost 
senseless,  and  a  feeling  of  faintness  having  crept  over  me. 
However,  by  walking  and  running  I  soon  recovered  heat 
enough,  and  after  passing  the  deep  glen  of  Langadale, 
ascended  an  eminence  in  a  kind  of  pass  between  two 
mountains,  whence  I  discovered  tokens  of  cultivation  at 
the  distance  of  three  or  four  miles. — British  Birds,  vol. 
i.  pp.  306,  307. 

8. — CROSSBILLS  FEEDING. 

In  the  autumn  of  1821,  when  walking  from  Aber- 
deen to  Elgin,  by  the  way  of  Glenlivet  and  along  the 
Spey,  I  had  the  pleasure  of  observing,  near  the  influx  of 
a  tributary  of  that  river,  a  flock  of  several  hundreds  of 
crossbills  busily  engaged  in  shelling  the  seeds  of  the 
berries  which  hung  in  clusters  on  a  clump  of  rowan 
trees.  So  intent  were  they  on  satisfying  their  hunger 
that  they  seemed  not  to  take  the  least  heed  of  me,  and 
as  I  had  not  a  gun  I  was  content  with  gazing  on  them, 
without  offering  them  any  molestation.  They  clung  to 
the  twigs  in  all  sorts  of  positions,  and  went  through  the 


154  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

operation  of  feeding  in  a  quiet  and  business-like  manner, 
each  attending  to  his  own  affairs  without  interfering 
with  his  neighbours.  It  was  indeed  a  pleasant  sight  to 
see  how  the  little  creatures  fluttered  among  the  twigs, 
all  in  continued  action,  like  so  many  bees  on  a  cluster 
of  flowers  in  sunshine  after  rain.  Their  brilliant  colours, 
so  much  more  gaudy  than  those  of  our  common  birds, 
seemed  to  convert  the  rude  scenery  around  into  that  of 
some  far  distant  land,  where  the  redbird  sports  among 
the  magnolia  flowers. — British  Birds,  vol.  i.  p.  425. 


9. — THE  RAVEN  IN  THE  HEBRIDES. 

The  character  of  the  raven  accords  well  with  the 
desolate  aspect  of  the  rugged  glens  of  the  Hebridian 
moors.  He  and  the  eagle  are  the  fit  inhabitants  of 
those  grim  rocks ;  the  red  grouse,  the  plover,  and  its 
page,  of  those  brown  and  scarred  heaths  ;  the  ptarmigan 
of  those  craggy  and  tempest-beaten  summits.  The  red- 
throated  diver  and  the  merganser,  beautiful  as  they  are, 
fail  to  give  beauty  to  those  pools  of  dark-brown  water, 
edged  with  peat  banks,  and  unadorned  with  sylvan 
verdure.  Even  the  water-lily,  with  its  splendid  white 
flowers,  floating  on  the  deep  bog,  reflects  no  glory  on 
the  surrounding  scenery,  but  selfishly  draws  all  your 
regards  to  itself.  There,  on  the  rifted  crag,  let  the 
dark  raven  croak  to  his  mate,  while  we  search  for  the 
species  in  distant  parts  of  the  land. — British  Birds,  vol. 
i.  p.  509. 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  155 


10. — SCENE  ON  AN  APRIL  DAY. 

It  is  a  lovely  April  day.  All  over  the  pale  blue 
sky  are  scattered  fleecy  tufts  of  white  vapour,  buds  of 
beauty  are  bursting  from  the  earth,  and  the  distant 
waterfall  fills  the  valley  with  its  soothing  murmur.  How 
delightful  the  scenery  of  these  wild  hills,  where  from 
the  rift  of  the  lichen-crusted  crag  juts  out  the  rowan, 
whose  elegantly  pinnated  foliage  is  fast  unfolding ; 
where,  scattered  along  the  broken  steep,  are  seen  the 
white-stemmed  birches,  with  their  drooping  twigs  and 
glistening  leaflets  ;  while  the  hillocks  are  crowned  with 
blossomed  furze ;  and  the  smooth  waters  of  the 
deep  lake  send  back  the  wooded  banks  and  the 
heath-clad  heights ! 

High  overhead  wheels  in  wanton  mazes  the  joyous 
snipe,  piping  its  singular  song,  and  anon  drumming  on 
tremulous  wing,  as  it  shoots  aslant.  The  shrill  scream 
of  the  curlew  is  responded  to  by  the  wail  of  the  lap- 
wing and  the  melancholy  whistle  of  the  golden  plover. 
Already  have  these  birds  desposited  their  eggs  on  the 
moor,  in  which  they  have  scraped  a  slight  hollow  for 
the  purpose  of  receiving  them.  Should  you  come  upon 
one  of  their  nests,  you  will  admire  the  arrangement  of 
its  four  pear-shaped  and  spotted  eggs,  the  narrow  ends 
of  which  meet  in  the  centre.  Among  the  tufts  of  furze 
and  sloe  hops  the  lively  ring  ouzel,  newly  arrived  from 
the  warmer  region  in  which  it  has  passed  the  winter ; 
and  by  the  pebbly  margin  of  the  pool  flits  the  delicate 


156  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

sandpiper,  whose  body  is  continually  vibrating  as  if  on 
a  pivot. 

It  is  the  busy  season  of  Nature.  What  myriads  of 
flowers  are  silently  expanding,  what  rills  of  vegetable 
juices  are  ascending  the  stems  of  the  topmost  twigs, 
what  mighty  preparations,  without  confusion  or  bustle, 
are  making  to  secure  an  abundant  produce  of  fruit  and 
seed  for  the  support  of  animal  life !  How  beautiful  the 
brooding  mystery  of  that  happy  raven,  seated  on  her 
nesif  to  impart  vital  warmth  to  her  newly -fledged  young, 
while  her  mate  croaks  in  joy  on  the  projecting  crag, 
ready  to  sally  forth  and  drive  away  the  prowling  hawk 
that  may  chance  to  come  near  his  ancient  seat,  the  castle 
of  his  sires  1  For  weeks  might  one  wander  among  those 
wooded  glens,  finding  each  hour  some  fresh  object  to 
excite  admiration,  and  warm  his  bosom  with  the  glow 
of  gratitude  toward  the  Supreme  Power  which  out  of 
nothing  has  called  all  these  wonders  into  being.  But 
at  present  we  are  mere  strolling  naturalists,  bent  on 
collecting  nests  and  eggs.  —  British  Birds,  vol.  i.  pp. 
616,  617. 


11. — SOME  OF  PROFESSOR  MACGILLIVRAY'S  FRIENDS. 

I  remember.  Mr.  Weir  is  an  enthusiast,  a  lover  of 
Nature,  and,  although  a  Conservative  and  a  trapper  of 
birds,  a  Christian  and  a  scholar.  I  forgot  him  when  I 
boasted  of  having  fought  my  way  with  my  own  claymore. 
You  shall  see  presently  how  efficient  his  aid  has  been. 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  157 

Other  friends  too,  still  dearer,  I  overlooked,  especially 
him  who  now,  in  some  Canadian  wilderness,  is  making 
room  for  himself  and  his  family,  beset  perhaps  with 
murderous  rebels  and  renegades,  my  best  and  most 
beloved  friend,  William  Craigie  ;  and  him  too,  of  sultry 
Louisiana,  the  wanderer  of  the  wild  woods,  the  warm- 
hearted and  generous  Audubon ;  and  many  more,  some 
of  whom  I  shall  have  occasion  to  mention,  but  above 
all,  one  who  will  presently  welcome  us,  for  here,  No.  1 
Wharton  Place,  we  end  our  digression  for  the  present. 
— British  Birds,  vol.  ii.  p.  13. 


12. — THE  SONG  OF  THE  BLACKBIRD. 

Although  the  blackbird  sings  at  all  times  of  the  day, 
it  is  more  especially  in  the  mornings  and  evenings  that 
it  pours  forth  its  delightful  melodies,  which,  simple  as 
they  are,  I  am  unable  to  describe  in  a  more  effective 
manner  than  by  characterising  them  as  loud,  rich,  mellow, 
and  much  surpassing  in  effect  those  of  any  other  native 
bird,  excepting  the  nightingale,  song  thrush,  black-cap, 
and  garden  warbler.  I  have  heard  individuals  singing 
most  fervently  in  the  midst  of  a  heavy  thunder  storm, 
when  the  rain  was  falling  thickly,  and  the  lightning 
flashing  at  an  alarming  rate ;  and  both  this  species  and 
the  song  thrush  seem  to  regard  the  summer  rains  with 
pleasure. 

The  sweet  strain,  loud,  but  mellowed  by  distance, 
comes  upon  the  ear,  inspiring  pleasant  thoughts,  and 


158  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

banishing  care  and  sorrow.  The  bird  has  evidently 
learned  his  part  by  long  practice,  for  he  sings  sedately 
and  in  the  full  consciousness  of  superiority.  Ceasing  at 
intervals,  he  renews  the  strain,  varying  it  so  that  although 
you  can  trace  an  occasional  repetition  of  notes,  the  staves 
are  precisely  the  same.  You  may  sit  an  hour  or  longer, 
and  yet  the  song  will  be  continued ;  and  in  the  neigh- 
bouring gardens  many  rival  songsters  will  sometimes 
raise  their  voices  at  once,  or  delight  you  with  alternate 
strains.  And  now,  what  is  the  purpose  of  all  this  melody  ? 
We  can  only  conjecture  that  it  is  the  expression  of  the 
perfect  happiness  which  the  creature  is  enjoying,  when, 
uncarked  by  care,  conscious  of  security,  and  aware  of 
the  presence  of  his  mate,  he  instinctively  pours  forth 
his  soul  in  joy  and  gratitude  and  love.  He  does  not 
sing  to  amuse  his  mate,  as  many  have  supposed,  for  he 
often  sings  in  winter,  when  he  is  not  yet  mated ;  nor 
does  he  sing  to  beguile  his  solitude,  for  now  he  is  not 
solitary  ;  but  he  sings  because  all  his  wants  are  satisfied, 
his  whole  frame  glowing  with  health,  and  because  his 
Maker  has  gifted  him  with  the  power  of  uttering  sweet 
sounds. — British  Birds,  vol.  ii.  pp.  89,  90. 


13. — THE  SONG  OF  THE  THRUSH. 

The  song  thrush  is  associated  in  my  memory  with 
the  Hebrides,  where  it  is  perhaps  more  abundant  than 
in  most  parts  of  Britain.  There,  in  the  calm  summer 
evening,  such  as  for  placid  beauty  far  exceeds  any  that 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  159 

I  have  elsewhere  seen,  when  the  glorious  sun  is  drawing 
towards  the  horizon,  and  shedding  a  broad  glare  of  ruddy 
light  over  the  smooth  surface  of  the  ocean ;  when  the 
scattered  sheep,  accompanied  by  their  frolicsome  lamb- 
kins, are  quietly  browsing  on  the  hills ;  when  the 
broad-winged  eagle  is  seen  skimming  along  the  mountain 
ridge,  as  he  wends  his  way  toward  his  eyry  on  the  far 
promontory ;  when  no  sound  comes  on  the  ear  save  at 
intervals  the  faint  murmur  of  the  waves  rushing  into  the 
caverns  and  rising  against  the  faces  of  the  cliffs ;  when 
the  western  breeze,  stealing  over  the  flowery  pastures, 
carries  with  it  the  perfume  of  the  wild  thyme  and  white 
clover  ;  the  song  of  the  thrush  is  poured  forth  from  the 
summit  of  some  granite  block,  shaggy  with  grey  lichens, 
and  returns  in  softer  and  sweeter  modulations  from  the 
sides  of  the  heathy  mountains.  There  may  be  wilder, 
louder,  and  more  marvellous  songs,  and  the  mocking 
bird  may  be  singing  the  requiem  of  the  Red  Indian  of 
the  Ohio,  or  cheering  the  heart  of  his  ruthless  oppressor, 
the  white  man  of  many  inventions ;  but  to  me  it  is 
all-sufficient,  for  it  enters  into  the  soul,  melts  the  heart 
into  tenderness,  diffuses  a  holy  calm,  and  connects  the 
peace  of  earth  with  the  transcendent  happiness  of  heaven. 
In  other  places  the  song  of  the  thrush  may  be  lively  and 
cheery  ;  here,  in  the  ocean-girt  solitude,  it  is  gentle  and 
soothing ;  by  its  magic  influence  it  smoothes  the  ruffled 
surface  of  the  sea  of  human  feelings,  as  it  floats  over  it 
at  intervals  with  its  varied  swells  and  cadences,  like  the 
perfumed  wavelets  of  the  summer  wind. — British  Birds, 
vol.  ii.  pp.  130,  181.

14. — THE  CAROL  OF  THE  LARK. 

The  mellow  song  of  the  merle  or  mavis  is  apt  to 
inspire  melancholy,  especially  if  heard  in  a  sequestered 
valley   toward    the    close    of    day,   and    the    feelings 
which  it  excites  have  perhaps  as  much  of  a  depressing 
as  of  a  soothing  tendency ;  but  the  carol  of  the  lark, 
like  the  lively  fife,  excites  pure  cheerfulness,  and  might 
with  propriety  be  prescribed  as  an  antidote  of  dulness. 
It  is  not  merely  music  that  we  look  for  in  the  song  of 
birds,  but  variety,  and  the  expression  of  passions,  feel- 
ings, and  wants.     Were  all  our  warblers  to  tune  their 
throats  according  to  rule,  we  should  become  sickly  and 
sentimental,  fill  the  valleys  with  sighs,  and  groan  from 
the  mountain  tops ;   but  the  loud  war-whoop  of  the 
eagle,  the  harsh  scream  of  the  heron,  and  the  croak  of 
the  raven,  are  antidotes  to  the  bewitching  melody  of 
the  black-cap  and  nightingale.     I  have  endeavoured  to 
trace  a  repetition  at  regular  intervals  in  the  strains  of 
the  lark ;  but  its  modulations  seem  to  have  no  rule.    In 
confinement  this  bird  sings  every  whit  as  well  as  when 
at  large ;  and  when  rapidly  perambulating  the  square 
bit  of  faded  turf  in  its  cage,  it  enacts  its  part  with 
apparently  as  much  delight  as  when  mounting  "  to- 
wards heaven's  gate." — British  Birds,  vol.  ii.  p.  170. 

15. — THE  HEN-HARRIER. 

Having  examined  the  form,  and  somewhat  of  the 
structure  of  the  hen-harrier,  we  are  prepared  for  the 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  161 

exhibition  of  its  faculties.  Kneel  down  here,  then, 
among  the  long  broom,  and  let  us  watch  the  pair  that 
have  just  made  their  appearance  on  the  shoulder  of  the 
hill.  Leave  these  beautiful  flowerets  to  the  inspection 
of  that  lank-sided  botanist,  who  drags  himself  slowly 
along,  with  a  huge  tin  cannister  on  his  back,  and  eyes 
ever  bent  on  the  ground.  Should  he  wander  hither- 
ward,  he  will  be  delighted  to  cull  the  lovely  tufts  of 
maiden-pinks  that  surround  us ;  but  we  look  heaven- 
ward, like  the  astronomers. 

How  beautifully  they  glide  along,  in  their  circling 
flight,  with  gentle  flaps  of  their  expanded  wings,  float- 
ing, as  it  were,  in  the  air,  their  half-spread  tails  inclined 
from  side  to  side,  as  they  balance  themselves,  or  alter 
their  course !  Now  they  are  near  enough  to  enable  us 
to  distinguish  the  male  from  the  female.  They  seem 
to  be  hunting  in  concert,  and  their  search  is  keen,  for 
they  fly  at  times  so  low  as  almost  to  touch  the  bushes, 
and  never  rise  higher  than  thirty  feet.  The  grey  bird 
hovers,  fixing  himself  in  air  like  the  kestrel ;  now  he 
stoops,  but  recovers  himself.  A  hare  breaks  from  the 
cover,  but  they  follow  her  not,  though,  doubtless,  were 
they  to  spy  her  young  one,  it  would  not  escape  so  well. 
The  female  now  hovers  for  a  few  seconds,  gradually 
sinks  for  a  short  space,  ascends,  turns  a  little  to  one 
side,  closes  her  wings,  and  comes  to  the  ground.  She 
has  secured  her  prey,  for  she  remains  concealed  among 
the  furze,  while  the  male  shoots  away,  flying  at  the 
height  of  three  or  four  yards,  sweeps  along  the  haw- 
thorn hedge,  bounds  over  it  to  the  other  side,  turns 

M 


162  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

away  to  skim  over  the  sedgy  pool,  where  he  hovers  a 
short  while.  He  now  enters  upon  the  grass  field,  when 
a  partridge  springs  off,  and  he  pursues  it  with  a  rapid, 
gliding  flight  like  that  of  the  sparrow-hawk  ;  but  they 
have  turned  to  the  right,  and  the  wood  conceals  them 
from  our  view.  In  the  meantime  the  female  has  sprung 
up,  and  advances,  keenly  inspecting  the  ground,  and  so 
heedless  of  our  presence  that  she  passes  within  twenty 
yards  of  us.  Away  she  speeds,  and  in  passing  the  pool 
again  stoops,  but  recovers  herself,  and,  rising  in  a  beauti- 
ful curve,  bounds  over  the  plantation,  and  is  out  of 
sight. — British  Birds,  vol.  iii.  pp.  371,  372. 


16. — THE  GOLDEN  PLOVER. 

Many  a  time  and  oft,  in  the  days  of  my  youth,  when 
the  cares  of  life  were  few  and  the  spirits  expansile,  and 
often,  too,  in  later  years,  when  I  had  made  a  temporary 
escape  to  the  wilderness  to  breathe  an  atmosphere  un- 
tainted by  the  effluvia  of  cities,  and  ponder  in  silence 
on  the  wonders  of  creative  power,  have  I  stood  on  the 
high  moor  and  listened  to  the  mellow  notes  of  the 
plover,  that  seemed  to  come  from  the  grey  slopes  of  the 
neighbouring  hills.  Except  the  soft  note  of  the  ring- 
plover,  I  know  none  so  pleasing  from  the  grallatorial 
tribes.  Amid  the  wild  scenery  of  the  rugged  hills  and 
sedgy  valleys,  it  comes  gently  and  soothingly  on  the 
ear,  and  you  feel,  without  being  altogether  conscious  of 
its  power,  that  it  soothes  the  troubled  mind,  as  water 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  163 

cools  the  burning  brow.  How  unlike  the  shriek  of  the 
heron — but  why  should  we  think  of  it,  for  it  reminds  us 
of  the  cracked  and  creaking  voice  of  some  village  bel- 
dame of  the  Saxon  race.  The  clear,  gentle  tones  of 
the  Celtic  maiden  could  not  be  more  pleasant  to  any 
one,  or  perhaps  much  more  welcome  to  her  lover,  than 
the  summer  note  of  the  golden  plover  to  the  lover  of 
birds  and  of  Nature.  As  you  listen  to  it,  now  distant, 
now  nearer  and  near,  and  see  the  birds  with  short  flights 
approaching  as  if  to  greet  you,  though  in  reality  with 
more  fear  than  confidence,  with  anxiety  and  apprehen- 
sion, the  bright  sunshine  that  glances  on  their  jetty 
breasts  is  faintly  obscured  by  the  white  vapours  that 
have  crept  up  from  the  western  valley,  and  presently  all 
around  us  is  suffused  with  an  opaline  light,  into  the  con- 
fines of  which  abird  is  dimly  seen  to  advance,  then  another, 
and  a  third.  Who  could  represent  the  scene  on  canvas 
or  card  ? — a  hollow  hemisphere  of  white  shining  mist, 
on  which  are  depicted  two  dark  human  figures,  their 
heads  surrounded  with  a  radiant  halo,  and  these  black- 
breasted  golden  plovers,  magnified  to  twice  their  natural 
size,  and  gazing  upon  us,  each  from  its  mossy  tuft.  It 
is  as  if  two  mortals  had  a  conference  on  the  heath  with 
three  celestial  messengers  —  and  so  they  have.  Pre- 
sently a  breeze  rolls  away  the  mist,  and  discloses  a 
number  of  those  watchful  sentinels,  each  on  his  mound 
of  faded  moss,  and  all  emitting  their  mellow  cries  the 
moment  we  offer  to  advance.  They  are  males,  whose 
mates  are  brooding  over  their  eggs,  or  leading  their 
down -clad  and  toddling  chicks  among  the,  to  them, 


164  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

pleasant  peat-bogs  that  intervene  between  the  high 
banks,  clad  with  luxuriant  heath,  not  yet  recovered 
from  the  effects  of  the  winter  frosts,  and  little  meadows 
of  cotton-grass,  white  as  the  snow-wreaths  that  lie  on 
the  distant  hill.  How  prettily  they  run  over  the  grey 
moss  and  lichens,  their  little  feet  twinkling  and  their 
full,  bright,  and  soft  eyes  gleaming,  as  they  commence 
their  attempts  to  entice  us  away  from  their  chosen 
retreats.  In  the  midst  of  them  alight  some  tiny  things, 
black-breasted  too,  with  reddish  backs  and  black  nebs 
and  neat  pointed  wings,  which  they  stretch  right  up, 
and  then  fold  by  their  sides.  These  are  plovers'  pages, 
which  also  have  their  nests  on  the  moor.  The  mist 
rolls  slowly  away,  and  is  ascending  in  downy  flakes  the 
steep  side  of  the  corrie,  whence  comes  suddenly  on  the 
ear  the  loud  scream  of  the  curlew — pleasing  too,  but  to 
the  deer  startling.  The  fewer  of  these  birds  on  the 
moors  after  the  12th  of  August,  the  better  for  the 
deer-stalker ;  but  that  day  is  far  distant. —  British 
Birds  vol.  iv.  p.  97. 


17. — COMMON  RING-PLOVER. 

Were  I  to  describe  the  manners  of  this  gentle 
creature  under  the  influence  of  the  delightful  emotions 
which  the  view  of  it  has  often  excited  in  me,  I  .should 
probably  appear  to  the  grave  admirer  of  Nature  an 
enthusiast,  or  an  imitator  of  other  men's  musings. 
Well,  let  him  think  as  he  lists ;  but  yet  lives  there 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  165 

the  man,  calling  himself  an  ornithologist,  who,  quietly 
strolling  along  the  bright  sandy  beach  just  left  bare 
by  the  retiring  tide,  and  aroused  from  his  pleasing 
reveries  by  the  mellow  whistle  of  the  ring-plover, 
would  not  gaze  with  delight  on  the  pleasant  little 
thing  that  speeds  away  before  him  with  twinkling 
feet,  now  stops,  pipes  its  clear  cry,  runs,  spreads  its 
beautiful  wings,  glides  close  over  the  sand,  and  alights 
on  some  not  distant  tuft.  What  are  primaries  and 
secondaries,  coecums  and  duodenums,  types  and 
analogies,  squares  or  circles,  to  him  who  thus  watches 
the  living  bird  ?  There  is  the  broad  blue  sea,  on  that 
hand  the  green  pasture,  under  foot  and  around  the 
pure  sand,  above  the  sunny  sky.  Frown  not  upon 
the  cheerfulness  of  Nature ;  shout  aloud,  run,  leap, 
make  the  sand  lark  thy  playmate.  Why  mayest  thou 
not  be  drunk  with  draughts  of  pure  ether  ?  Are  the 
gambols  of  a  merry  naturalist  less  innocent  than  the 
mad  freaks,  the  howlings,  the  ravings  of  sapient  men 
assembled  to  deliberate  about  corn-laws,  or  party 
zealots  upholding  their  creed  by  palpably  demonstrat- 
ing their  total  want  of  charity  ? — British  Birds,  vol.  iv.

18.— THE  SEA-PIE. 

Should  one  consider  the  sea-pie  the  most  beautiful 
of  our  native  birds,  I  should  not  much  censure  his 
taste.  When  by  the  silver  Dee,  gliding,  rapidly  along, 
amidst  corn-fields,  pastures,  and  fragrant  birch-woods, 


166  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

you  hear  a  loud  and  shrill  cry,  and,  turning  about,  see 
a  pair  winging  their  flight  up  the  country,  their  glossy 
black  and  pure  white  plumage  contrasting  strongly 
with  everything  around,  and  their  long  vermilion 
beaks  giving  them  a  strange  and  foreign  aspect,  they 
never  fail  to  rivet  your  gaze.  Equally  attractive  are 
they  when  running  about  on  some  grassy  meadow, 
picking  up  an  insect  or  a  slug,  then  standing,  and 
again  advancing  with  quick,  short  steps,  prettily 
tripping  it  among  the  gowans ;  then  emitting  their 
loud  alarm-cries,  and  flying  off  to  a  more  distant  place, 
or  alighting  on  a  pebbly  beach.  No  creature  but  man 
seems  to  molest  them ;  but  of  his  advances  they  are 
always  suspicious,  as  good  need  they  have  to  be. — 
British  Birds,,  vol.  iv.  p.  158. 


19. — DUNLINS  FEEDING. 

I,  on  the  9th  of  September  1840,  walked  to 
Musselburgh,  where  I  was  informed  that  the  sandpipers 
were  very  abundant ;  and,  having  betaken  myself  to 
the  mouth  of  the  Esk  soon  after  the  tide  had  turned, 
was  gratified  by  the  sight  of  a  great  number  of 
dunlins  and  ring-plovers.  In  the  first  place  I  met 
with  two  flocks  reposing,  the  one  among  some  thin 
herbage,  composed  chiefly  of  Glaux  maritima;  the 
other  on  a  slightly  elevated  part  of  the  sand,  just  above 
water -mark.  Individuals  of  both  species  were  inter- 
mingled, all  lying  flat  on  the  ground,  and  in  a  crouch- 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  167 

ing  attitude,  with  the  neck  drawn  in.  Thus,  as  I 
have  elsewhere  observed,  these  birds  repose  during  the 
period  of  high  water  in  unfrequented  places  along  the 
shore,  and  generally,  especially  if  there  be  a  strong 
wind,  in  a  decumbent  posture.  On  my  approaching 
them,  they  dispersed,  and  began  to  search  for  food. 
Presently  straggling  bands  flew  in  from  a  distance  and 
alighted  on  the  shore.  The  dunlins  on  such  occasions 
come  gliding  on  outspread  wings,  which  in  alighting 
they  extend  and  elevate  a  little.  They  then  run  a 
few  steps,  and  stand  a  short  time,  or  at  once  commence 
their  search.  These  bands  were  remarkably  intent  on 
seeking  for  food,  so  that  I  was  allowed  to  walk  up  to 
about  fifteen  paces  from  one  of  them.  In  this  flock 
of  about  fifteen,  two  limped,  apparently  having  had 
one  of  their  legs  damaged  by  shot,  yet  they  seemed 
scarcely  less  active  than  the  rest.  Being  in  a  muddy 
place,  which  probably  afforded  a  good  supply  of  food, 
they  did  not  run  much,  but  yet  moved  quickly  about, 
with  their  legs  a  little  bent,  the  body  horizontal,  the 
head  a  little  declined,  and  the  bill  directed  forwards 
toward  the  ground  at  an  angle  of  about  forty-five 
degrees.  I  observed  that  they  seemed  in  general 
merely  to  touch  the  surface,  but  also  sometimes  to 
introduce  their  bill  into  the  mud  for  about  a  fourth  of 
its  length ;  but  this  always  with  a  rapid  tapping  and 
somewhat  wriggling  movement,  and  not  by  thrusting 
it  in  sedately.  This  flock  having  flown  away,  I 
observed  another  of  about  twelve  individuals  alight  at 
a  little  distance  on  the  other  side  of  the  mill-stream. 


168  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

Being  very  intent  on  tapping  the  mud,  they  allowed 
me  to  approach  within  ten  paces,  so  that  I  could  see 
them  very  distinctly.  I  was  surprised  to  hear  from 
them  a  very  gentle  warble,  which  was  composed  of 
feeble  notes  somewhat  resembling  the  syllables  pee- 
pee-pee,  continually  repeated,  and  with  more  frequency 
when  the  individuals  came  very  near  each  other. 
These  notes  could  not  be  heard  at  a  greater  distance 
than  twenty  yards,  and  would  thus  be  entirely  lost  to 
the  casual  observer.  All  at  once  I  heard  a  singular 
noise,  which  might  be  likened  to  a  cough,  shrill  and 
feeble  as  it  was,  and  presently  found  that  it  came  from 
one  which,  having  picked  up  something  too  large  for  its 
gullet,  stood  endeavouring  to  swallow  it  by  repeated 
jerks,  at  each  of  which  it  emitted  a  sharp  wheezing  or 
hissing  sound.  The  rest  paid  no  attention  to  the 
distressed  bird,  which  in  about  three  minutes  got  the 
morsel  down,  and  resumed  its  search.  While  thus 
busily  employed,  and  quite  regardless  of  me,  although 
so  near  that  I  could  see  their  little  dusky  eyes,  and  dis- 
tinguish by  its  tints  one  individual  from  another,  a  sand- 
piper, Totanus  hypoleucos,  came  silently  gliding  over 
them  at  the  height  of  not  more  than  three  feet.  It  was 
beautiful  to  see  how  they  all  rose  simultaneously  on  wing 
to  the  height  of  from  two  to  four  feet,  and,  finding  that 
they  had  no  cause  of  alarm,  immediately  re-alight.  I  now 
struck  my  note-book  against  my  hand,  when  they  all 
rose,  but  alighted  about  five  yards  off,  and  three  of  them 
came  within  ten  paces  of  me.  As  nothing  more  was 
to  be  seen,  I  examined  the  marks  made  by  them  in 


BIRD    LIFE,   ETC.  169 

the  mud.  Although  it  was  soft,  very  few  footmarks 
were  left ;  but  the  place  was  covered  with  numberless 
small  holes  made  by  their  bills,  and  forming  little 
groups,  as  if  made  by  the  individual  birds  separately. 
Of  these  impressions  very  many  were  mere  hollows 
not  larger  than  those  on  a  thimble,  and  not  half  a 
twelfth  of  an  inch  deep ;  others  scarcely  perceptible, 
while  a  few  were  larger,  extended  to  a  depth  of  two- 
twelfths  ;  and  here  and  there  one  or  two  to  the  depth 
of  nearly  half  an  inch.  On  scraping  the  mud  I  could 
perceive  no  worms  or  shells.  It  is  thus  clear  that 
they  search  by  gently  tapping,  and  it  appears  that 
they  discover  the  object  of  their  search  rather  by  the 
kind  of  resistance  which  it  yields  than  by  touch  like 
that  of  the  human  skin. — British  Birds,  vol.  iv. 
p.  210. 

20. — THE  COMMON  SNIPE. 

Beautiful  are  those  green  woods  that  hang  upon  the 
craggy  sides  of  the  fern-clad  hills,  where  the  heath-fowl 
threads  its  way  among  the  tufts  of  brown  heath,  and  the 
cuckoo  sings  his  ever -pleasing  notes  as  he  balances 
himself  on  the  grey  stone,  vibrating  his  fan -like  tail. 
Now  I  listen  to  the  simple  song  of  the  mountain 
blackbird,  warbled  by  the  quiet  lake  that  spreads  its 
glittering  bosom  to  the  sun,  winding  far  away  among 
the  mountains,  amid  whose  rocky  glens  wander  the  wild 
deer,  tossing  their  antlered  heads  on  high  as  they  snuff 
the  breeze  tainted  with  the  odour  of  the  slow -paced 


170  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

shepherd  and  his  faithful  dog.  In  that  recess  formed 
by  two  rnoss-clad  slabs  of  mica-slate,  the  lively  wren 
jerks  up  its  little  tail,  and  chits  its  merry  note,  as  it 
recalls  its  straggling  young  ones  that  have  wandered 
among  the  bushes.  From  the  sedgy  slope,  sprinkled 
with  white  cotton-grass,  comes  the  shrill  cry  of  the 
solitary  curlew ;  and  there,  high  over  the  heath,  wings 
his  meandering  way  the  joyous  snipe,  giddy  with  excess 
of  unalloyed  happiness. 

There  another  has  sprung  from  among  the  yellow 
flowered  marigolds  that  profusely  cover  the  marsh. 
Upwards  slantingly,  on  rapidly  vibrating  wings,  he 
shoots,  uttering  the  while  his  shrill  two -noted  cry. 
Tissick,  tissick,  quoth  the  snipe,  as  he  leaves  the  bog. 
Now  in  silence  he  wends  his  way,  until  at  length, 
having  reached  the  height  of  perhaps  a  thousand  feet,  he 
zigzags  along,  emitting  a  louder  and  shriller  cry  of  zoo- 
zee,  zoo-zee,  zoo-zee,  which  over,  varying  his  action,  he 
descends  on  quivering  pinions,  curving  toward  the  earth 
with  surprising  speed,  while  from  the  rapid  beats  of  his 
wing  the  tremulous  air  gives  to  the  ear  what  at  first 
seems  the  voice  of  distant  thunder.  This  noise  some 
have  likened  to  the  bleating  of  a  goat  at  a  distance  on 
the  hillside,  and  thus  have  named  our  bird  the  air-goat 
and  air-bleater.  The  sound,  I  think,  is  evidently 
produced  by  the  rapid  action  of  the  wings,  which,  during 
its  continuance,  are  seen  to  be  in  tremulous  motion.  It 
comes  on  the  ear  soon  after  the  bird  commences  its 
descent,  and  ceases  when,  having  gained  the  lowest  part 
of  the  curve,  it  recovers  itself,  and  ascends  with  a 


BIRD    LIFE,  ETC.  171 

different  and  ordinary  motion  of  its  wings.  I  have  never 
heard  it  under  any  other  circumstances.  Were  it  pro- 
duced by  the  voice,  it  might  be  emitted  when  the  bird 
is  on  the  ground,  or  during  its  ordinary  flight ;  but 
should  one  hear  it  on  the  moor,  he  will  invariably  find 
that  it  proceeds  from  on  high.  In  this  manner  the  snipe 
may  continue  to  amuse  itself  for,  perhaps,  an  hour  or 
more ;  and  sometimes,  in  the  clear  sky,  one  may  trace 
it  until  at  length  it  mounts  so  high  as  to  be  no  longer 
perceptible. 

This  drumming  noise  of  the  snipe  commences  in 
April  and  is  continued  through  the  summer.  It  is 
altogether  a  solitary  act,  although  several  individuals 
may  often  be  heard  at  the  same  time,  and  may  be  an 
expression  of  the  happiness  of  the  bird,  or  an  intimation 
of  its  presence  to  its  mate  while  sitting  upon  her  eggs. 
We  have  no  means  of  ascertaining  its  object,  nor  has  it 
been  determined  whether  it  be  performed  by  the  male 
only,  or  by  the  female  also.  When  the  bird  has  gone 
through  his  evolutions,  he  descends,  often  with  astonish- 
ing velocity,  on  partially  extended  and  apparently 
motionless  wings,  diminishes  his  speed  a  little  as  he 
approaches  the  ground  obliquely,  and  alights  abruptly.

21. — THE  GREY  HERON. 

Far  away  through  the  green  valley  winds  the  silver 
Tweed,  now  rolling  its  waters  over  the  white  pebbles, 


172  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

then  gliding  placidly  between  banks  covered  with  fresh 
herbage  and  gaudy  florets  of  many  hues.  The  hum  of 
the  wild  bee  draws  your  eye  toward  those  beautiful  tufts 
of  purple  trefoil ;  the  weet-weet,  ever  vibrating  its  body 
as  if  delicately  balanced  on  its  slim  legs,  runs  along  the 
sunny  beach,  spreads  out  its  pointed  wings,  and  skims 
over  the  pool.  There,  in  the  water,  nearly  up  to  the 
knees,  is  the  heron,  patiently  waiting  an  opportunity  of 
seizing  some  giddy  trout.  Those  ducklings  that  swim 
so  beautifully,  and  dive  with  such  marvellous  quickness, 
he  seems  to  eye  with  hungry  glance  ;  but  their  watchful 
protectress  is  in  the  midst  of  them.  That  wary  old 
water-rat  is  equally  safe,  as  he  nibbles  the  grass  at  the 
mouth  of  his  hole,  and  at  intervals  trims  his  whiskers 
with  his  little  paws.  In  short,  go  where  you  will,  in 
summer  or  in  winter,  to  the  shores  of  the  sea  or  the  far 
inland  lake,  the  source  of  the  estuary  of  the  hill-born 
streams,  you  may  here  and  there  find  a  solitary  heron.

22. — THE  GREAT  BLACK-BACKED  GULL. 

It  is  a  lovely  night  in  June  ;  the  moon  slowly  emerges 
from  behind  the  distant  mountains,  the  northern  horizon 
is  still  red  with  the  glare  of  the  departed  sun,  the  winds 
have  sunk  to  rest,  and  no  sound  is  heard  save  the  faint 
murmur  of  the  waves  that  clash  over  the  distant  reefs. 
Yet,  hark !  the  terns  are  abroad,  and  their  shrill  cries 
come  faintly  on  the  ear,  from  the  far-off*  sand -point, 


BIRD   LIFE,   ETC.  173 

where,  no  doubt,  they  are  engaged  with  a  shoal  of 
launces.  Listen  again  !  The  oyster- catchers  intermingle 
their  clamorous  and  curiously  modulated  cries  ;  and  now, 
louder  than  all,  is  clearly  heard  the  call  of  the  black- 
backed  gull,  faintly  seen  in  the  dim  light.  Here  is  one 
of  his  breeding-places,  a  turf-crowned  crag,  torn,  as  it 
were,  from  the  rocks,  and  forming  an  inlet  inaccessible 
to  human  feet.  Creeping  stealthily  among  the  crags, 
we  faintly  perceive  the  birds  as  they  sit  on  their  nests ; 
but  some  of  them  have  observed  us.  All  spring  on  their 
feet,  and  a  few  launch  into  the  air,  uttering  loud  cries, 
which  alarm  the  birds  around.  It  is  vain,  you  perceive, 
to  try  to  surprise  them  by  night  or  by  day.  Wander 
as  long  as  you  will  in  these  places,  what  more  can  you 
see?  Perhaps  a  more  acute  observer  may. — British 
Birds,  vol.  v.  p.  534. 


23.— GOD'S  WORKS. 

Let  us  then  humble  ourselves,  that  in  contemplating 
God's  works,  we  may  ever  see  Him  in  the  midst  of  them. 
If,  in  this  temper,  we  traverse  the  valley  of  the  Dee, 
and  ascend  the  mountains  from  which  the  sources  of 
that  beautiful  river  gush  forth,  even  if  we  discover  little 
that  may  be  of  interest  to  science,  we  shall  find  much 
that  may  benefit  our  spiritual  nature.  And  what  would 
it  profit  a  man  were  he  to  solve  half  the  mysteries  of 
external  Nature,  and  yet  be  ignorant  of  the  higher 
relations  of  his  own  being  ?  Strange  adventures,  perils

among  rocks  and  floods,  wonderful  discoveries,  or 
magnificent  theories,  cannot  be  expected  from  a  quiet 
journey  to  be  made  in  one  pair  of  shoes,  with  no  other 
weapon  than  a  hammer. — Natural  History  of  Deeside, 
p.  23. 

24. — PROMISE  OF  A  BRIGHT  DAY. 

The  dawn  of  this  7th  of  August  gave  promise  of 
a  bright  day.  How  beautiful  is  the  quiet  valley  as  it 
basks  in  the  sunshine.  The  corn-fields,  some  nearly 
ready  for  the  sickle,  others  yet  green,  are  spread  out 
by  the  margin  of  the  river,  which  glides  along  in  its 
winding  course,  emitting  a  pleasing  murmur,  except- 
ing which  the  ear  catches  no  sound ;  for  the  air  is 
still,  and  even  the  hair-grass  waves  not  its  slender 
panicle.  The  cattle  are  feeding  on  the  after-grass ; 
here  and  there  a  peasant  is  seen  in  the  fields,  or  near 
the  few  cottages  scattered  over  the  valley ;  but  other- 
wise all  is  very  still,  and  in  the  gentle  beauty  of  the 
scene  one  hardly  sees  a  place  for  human  wickedness. 
If  it  is  not  a  paradise  we  gaze  upon,  it  is  a  scene 
well  fitted  to  remind  us  of  how  much  happiness  our 
earthly  habitation  might  yield  were  it  always  illumin- 
ated by  a  sense  of  the  Divine  presence. —  Natural 
History  of  Deeside,  p.  49. 

25. — LOCHNAGAR. 

Still   onward,    amidst   woods   and   mountains,    and 
here  and  there  fields,  yielding  the  staple  food  of  the 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  175 

Scot.  Let  us  again  look  southward,  "  o'er  moors  and 
mosses  mony,"  to  the  never-tiring  glories  of  Lochnagar, 
which  is  now  much  nearer  to  us  than  when  we  first  saw 
it.  Like  Edinburgh,  it  may  be  viewed  with  interest  from 
any  station.  For  my  part,  I  could  gaze  a  quarter  of 
an  hour  on  either  every  day  of  the  year  without  getting 
tired.  There,  proudly  pre-eminent  over  all  around, 
just  as  it  settled  when  it  was  heaved  up  from  the 
abyss,  it  stands  in  solemn  grandeur,  its  ridges  wreathed 
in  white  vapour.  Lochnagar  has  more  dignity  than 
any  of  our  hills,  except  Ben  Nevis. — Natural  History 
of  Deeside,  p.  55. 


26. — VIEW  FROM  INVERCAULD  BRIDGE. 

At  length  we  stand  on  the  lofty  mid-arch  of  Inver- 
cauld  Bridge.  Before  we  pass  on,  let  us  pause  once 
more — not  because  we  are  weary  of  travel  or  of  the 
world.  Here  the  bed  of  the  Dee  is  obliquely  inter- 
cepted by  a  broken  ridge  of  slaty  rock,  passing  from 
south-west  to  north-east.  The  stream  is  broken  by 
it  into  a  succession  of  little  falls  and  rapids,  and  then 
glides  away  over  its  stony  bed  to  wind  afar  amidst 
pine-clad  hills.  Beautiful  scene  !  I  almost  weep  when 
I  look  upon  thee ;  for  tears  flow  from  the  pure 
fountain  of  happiness  as  well  as  from  the  troubled 
springs  of  sorrow.  How  unlike,  in  thy  quiet  loveli- 
ness, to  the  fierce  rudeness  of  human  nature !  Not  a 
living  creature  is  to  be  seen  but  a  lad  whipping  the 


176  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

water.  The  western  sun  shines  in  full  splendour  in 
a  sky  unobscured,  although  scattered  flakes  of  white 
vapour  glide  slowly  eastward  in  its  upper  region. 
Long  shadows  are  projected  from  the  tall  pines,  while 
the  hill-tops,  purpled  with  flowering  heath,  or  grey 
with  lichen-crusted  stones,  are  lighted  with  the  blaze. 
Far  away  up  the  wooded  glens  is  still  seen  the  scarred 
ridge  of  Lochnagar.  Not  a  breath  stirs  the  tiny  leaf 
of  the  birch,  nor  a  sound  is  heard  but  from  the  waters. 
Ought  not  he  to  whom  Providence  has  allotted  all 
this  to  be  happy  ?  The  scene  is  mine  and  thine ; 
but  happiness  comes  not  from  without.  Yet,  O 
Invercauld  !  thou  hast  a  patrimony  of  beauty.  May 
it  long  be  enjoyed  by  thee  and  thine.  I  see  nothing 
wanting  but  scattered  homes  of  happy  tenants,  and 
little  patches  of  yellow  corn,  and  cows  feeding  by  the 
river,  and  sheep  on  the  hills. — Natural  History  of 
Deeside,  p.  56. 


27. — THE  RAVEN — POOR  BIRD  ! 

It  is  now  beginning  to  get  dusky.  The  croak 
of  the  raven  seems  to  warn  us  of  the  approach 
of  night.  Poor  bird !  he  has  little  cause  to  harbour 
friendly  feelings  towards  us ;  for  fearful  has  been 
the  persecution  which  he  and  his  race  have  suffered, 
if  not  at  our  hands,  yet  at  those  of  our  kindred. 
Very  seldom  now  is  a  raven  to  be  met  with,  even 
in  this  wild  tract  of  mountain  and  glen :  gamekeepers 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  177 

and  sheep -farmers,  with  guns  and  traps,  have  left 
but  a  very  scanty  residue  of  a  once  prosperous 
and  respectable  race.  The  same  inconsiderate 
selfishness  which  has  cleared  Van  Dieman's  Land 
of  its  aboriginal  population  has  destroyed  our  magni- 
ficent eagles  and  sagacious  ravens.  It  is  indeed  a 
rare  pleasure  to  hear  the  barking  and  yelping  of  that 
distant  bird  which  from  the  red  crags  to  the  right 
calls  aloud  to  his  mate,  perched  behind  us  on  that 
rugged  ridge. — Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  83. 


28. — ANOTHER  NIGHT  VISIT  TO  THE  SOURCES  OF 

THE  DEE. 

In  September  1819  a  poor  student  of  King's 
College,  Aberdeen,  ascended  to  the  sources  of  the  Dee 
on  his  way  to  Kingussie  and  Fort  William.  From 
his  journal  I  make  the  following  extract : — "  About 
three  or  four  miles  above  the  Linn,  the  Dee  is  joined 
by  a  river  equal  in  size,  namely  the  Geaully,  the  source 
of  which  I  had  explored  in  1816,  when  I  came  across 
the  mountains  from  Blair  Atholl.  Hitherto  I  had 
travelled  in  a  westerly  direction,  but  now  proceeded 
northward,  following  the  river.  There  are  no  houses 
beyond  the  junction  mentioned.  About  a  mile  above 
it,  I  came  in  sight  of  a  most  magnificent  rock,  with  a 
mountain  peak  behind  it  of  greater  elevation.  When 
I  reached  this  rock,  I  learned  by  the  light  scarlet 
colour  of  the  clouds  on  the  ridges  that  the  sun  was 

N 


178  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

setting.  Passing  the  rock,  I  entered  a  valley  bounded 
on  both  sides  by  very  lofty  and  rugged  mountains, 
and  terminating  in  a  vast  mass,  towering  above  the 
whole.  Before  I  reached  the  upper  end  of  this 
magnificent,  though  wild  and  desolate  valley,  night 
fell.  About  this  time  I  saw  a  deer  not  far  from  me. 
Near  the  upper  end  of  the  valley  the  stream  which 
I  had  followed  separated  into  two.  It  was  with  great 
difficulty  that  I  clambered  to  this  part  to  see  which 
was  the  largest,  that  I  might  follow  it.  Having 
ascertained  that  the  largest  stream  came  from  a  valley 
which  branched  off  at  a  right  angle  from  the  extremity 
of  the  main  one,  I  entered  this  valley  and  proceeded 
about  three-quarters  of  a  mile.  It  was  by  this  time 
completely  dark,  and  I  determined  to  rest  myself." 

The  narrative  goes  on  to  state  that  the  night  was 
passed  here,  in  a  sheltered  place,  but  with  little  sleep, 
some  shivering,  and  many  melancholy  thoughts : — 
"  About  midnight  I  looked  up  and  saw  the  moon  and 
some  stars.  They  were  at  times  obscured  by  masses 
of  vapour,  which  rolled  along  the  summits  of  the 
mountains.  I  had  now  a  better  view  of  my  situation. 
I  was  near  the  upper  end  of  a  high  valley,  completely 
surrounded  by  enormous  masses  of  rock.  Behind  me, 
my  face  being  towards  the  mouth  of  the  valley,  there 
rose  at  its  upper  end  a  high  mountain  involved  in 
clouds ;  on  the  right  hand  was  another,  in  the  form 
of  a  pyramidal  rock,  and,  contiguous  with  it,  a  peak 
of  less  elevation ;  on  the  left  hand,  a  high  ridge 
running  from  the  mountain  in  the  north-west,  and 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  179 

terminating  at  the  mouth  of  the  valley  in  a  dark 
conical  mass ;  and,  straight  before  me,  in  the  south-east, 
at  the  distance  of  nearly  a  mile,  another  vast  mountain. 
The  summits  of  all  were  at  times  enveloped  in  clouds. 
The  wind,  which  blew  from  the  west,  was  not  keen, 
and  the  night  was  such  as,  in  comfortable  circum- 
stances, might  be  called  warm.  Yet  on  awakening 
from  my  slumber  I  felt  chilly,  and  soon  after  began 
to  shiver.  I  then  rose,  and  gathered  a  few  large  stones 
and  a  good  deal  of  grass  and  short  heath,  with  which 
I  formed  a  somewhat  snug  sort  of  couch.  Unloosing 
my  pack,  I  took  a  night-cap  and  a  pair  of  stockings 
from  it,  which  I  applied  to  their  proper  use,  for  my 
feet  had  been  wetted  in  crossing  a  brook,  and  my 
hat  alone  did  not  keep  my  head  warm  after  the  per- 
spiration it  had  undergone.  Then,  eating  a  little  of  my 
scanty  store  of  barley  bread,  and  drinking  two  or  three 
cupfuls  of  water  from  a  neighbouring  rill,  1  lay  down, 
put  heather  and  my  knapsack  over  my  feet,  placed 
myself  in  an  easy  posture,  and  fell  asleep. 

"I  awoke  fresh,  but  weak,  about  sunrise.  The 
stream  which  I  had  followed  here  divided  into  two, 
and  I  chose  the  largest.  It  led  me  to  a  magnificent 
corrie,  in  the  form  of  a  deep  hollow  scooped  out  of 
the  great  ridge,  on  the  left  of  the  glen,  as  described, 
but  now  on  my  right  hand  in  ascending  it.  The  sides 
of  this  corrie  were  formed  of  sloping  rocks  of  vast 
height.  The  rivulet  came  tumbling  down  the  centre 
in  the  form  of  a  cataract.  Here  the  rocks  were  most 
abrupt;  but  I  had  determined  to  proceed,  at  least  to 


180  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

attempt  the  ascent.  Before  I  reached  the  base  of  the 
rocks,  I  felt  very  weak,  and  was  obliged  to  halt  every 
now  and  then.  However,  I  proceeded,  and  at  length, 
being  well  accustomed  to  rock-climbing,  found  my- 
self on  the  very  summit  of  this  vast  mass  of  rock.  It 
was  covered  with  mist,  which  rolled  rapidly  along  the 
ridges.  The  sun  now  and  then  appeared  through  it. 
The  view  through  the  corrie,  which  I  had  just  ascended, 
was  delightful — dreadful  it  might  have  been  to  some 
— the  whole  glen,  the  deep  corrie  just  beneath,  with 
its  fearful  rocks,  the  opposite  mountains  with  an  Alpine 
lake  before  me.  The  scene  was  truly  sublime,  and  I 
contemplated  it  with  great  delight. 

"  I  had  now  reached  the  rounded  summit  of  the  ridge, 
and  proceeding  along  the  streamlet,  which  was  the  prin- 
cipal object  of  my  research,  I  traced  it  to  two  fountains 
and  several  smaller  springs.  I  took  a  glassful  from 
each  of  the  larger,  and  drank  it  to  the  health  of 
my  friends.  Near  these  fountains,  which  were 
among  coarse  granite  sand,  I  saw  a  covey  of  ptarmi- 
gans, and  a  small  bird,  which  I  took  for  Alauda 
pratensis.  The  only  phsenogamous  plants  which  grew 
on  the  summit  of  the  mountain  were  Silene  acaulis 
and  Salix  herbacea,  both  in  abundance,  the  former 
still  in  flower. 

"  Descending  on  the  northern  side  of  the  mountain, 
I  came  upon  a  precipitous  corrie,  down  which  I  did  not 
venture,  and  farther  on  found  myself  on  a  precipice, 
from  which  I  had  a  view  of  a  deep  valley,  with  a  lake 
and  a  stream,  ending  in  a  plain  partially  covered  with 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  181 

fir.  The  view  from  this  place  was  vast,  and  I  thought  I 
distinguished  the  sea ;  but  of  this  I  was  not  certain,  as 
the  mist  obscured  the  view  at  times.  In  my  descent  I 
saw  a  considerable  number  of  ptarmigans,  and  some 
specimens  of  crystallised  quartz,  though  not  very  fine. 
On  the  northern  side  of  the  mountain  some  Alpine 
lakes  occurred,  in  which  I  could  not  find  anything  but 
Sparganium  natans,  and  a  few  poor  specimens  of  Caltha 
palustris,  which  plant  I  also  saw  in  the  rivulets.  Hold- 
ing still  a  northerly  direction,  I  crossed  a  broken  plain, 
and  ascended  a  gentle  acclivity,  at  the  end  of  which  I 
found  a  larger  plain,  which  I  also  crossed.  At  the  end 
of  this  plain  I  came  to  an  opening  which  led  into  a  deep 
valley,  bounded  by  rocks  and  rapid  gravelly  slopes. 
Descending  by  this  valley,  which  I  found  very  long 
and  very  rugged,  into  a  plain  which  led  to  a  stream  of 
considerable  size,  and  evidently  a  tributary  of  the  Spey, 
I  at  length  reached  the  low  ground,  and  directed  myself 
westward." 

Not  knowing  by  name  a  single  one  of  the  localities 
mentioned  in  the  above  narrative,  I  had  not  been  aware 
of  my  having  passed  up  Glen  Dee  to  the  base  of  Ben- 
na-muic-dhui,  and  slept  in  the  Glen  of  the  Garrachory. 
But  the  journey  of  1850,  performed  under  circumstances 
in  some  respects  more  favourable,  has  shown  me  that  I 
had  in  1819  visited  the  so-called  sources  of  the  Dee  on 
the  ridge  of  Braeriach,  and  crossed  the  range  to  the 
valley  of  the  Spey.  The  description  above  given,  brief 
and  without  ornament,  is  perfectly  correct  and  quite 
intelligible.  My  condition  at  that  time  was  very 


182  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

different  from  my  present  state  ;  but  the  lapse  of  thirty 
years  has  not  diminished  my  enthusiasm,  nor  in  the  least 
impaired  my  faculties,  physical  or  mental. — Natural 
History  qfDeeside,  p.  99. 


29. — OBJECT  OF  THE  STUDY  OF  NATURE. 

Our  objects  in  examining  the  stone,  the  rock,  the 
lichen,  the  moss,  the  flower,  the  fruit,  the  insect,  the 
bird,  or  the  quadruped,  is  to  exercise  our  faculties  by 
learning  how  beautifully,  and  with  what  wisdom  all 
things  have  been  constructed,  how  wonderfully  they  are 
formed  with  relation  to  each  other,  and  how  manifestly 
they  display  a  power  of  which  we  could  form  no  con- 
ception were  we  not  to  attend  to  its  working  as 
exhibited  by  them.  It  is  true,  we  cannot  fully  com- 
prehend the  complicated  relations  of  the  most  common 
objects,  much  less  understand  the  ordination  of  the 
universe,  or  even  of  our  own  world  ;  but  we  labour  in 
hope ;  we  are  studying — some  of  us,  no  doubt,  very 
superficially,  others  more  profoundly — the  works  of  the 
Deity ;  and  the  more  progress  we  make,  the  more  we 
glorify  Him  by  an  intelligent,  not  a  vague,  admiration. 
There  are  some  who  aim  at  the  knowledge  of  general 
laws,  some  who  seek  simple  facts.  Both  parties  will 
find  enough  to  engage  their  faculties,  and  neither  will 
do  the  work  of  the  other  efficiently.  There  is  no  reason 
why  one  should  despise  the  other.  Contempt  of  any- 
thing but  vice  indicates  an  unsound  mind,  a  defective 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  183 

judgment,  an  ignorance  of  the  relations  which  men  have 
to  each  other  and  to  their  Creator,  an  undue  self- 
estimation,  and  a  contempt  of  the  rights  of  other  men. 
He  who  measures  the  orbit  of  a  comet  has  not,  there- 
fore, higher  faculties  than  he  who  examines  the  cyto- 
blast  of  a  fungus  ;  and  there  is  far  more  to  be  seen  by 
us  in  a  beetle  than  in  a  planet ;  upon  that  granite 
mountain  opposite,  at  the  distance  of  nine  or  ten  miles, 
than  in  the  sun  and  in  the  moon  and  the  stars. — 
Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  120. 


30. — THE  SCENERY  OF  BENABUIRD. 

On  reaching  the  summit,  I  found  it  to  be  a  long, 
broad,  rounded  ridge,  covered  with  stones,  some  of 
which  were  rounded,  others  angular.  Here  were  a  few 
mosses  and  a  considerable  quantity  of  Carex  ngida. 
The  scene  which  here  presented  itself  was  exceedingly 
striking  and  impressive.  All  around,  mountains 
appeared  behind  mountains,  with  their  rocks,  ridges, 
and  valleys.  A  solemn  stillness  prevailed ;  nor  was  a 
living  creature  to  be  seen  ;  the  clouds  rolled  their  dusky 
wreaths  along  the  ridges.  The  beams  of  the  setting 
sun  darted  here  and  there  through  the  clouds,  which 
exhibited  a  hundred  ever -varying  shades.  In  one 
direction  a  vast  livid  mass  hung  over  the  ridges  of  a 
mountain,  its  lower  fringed  margin  beautifully  tinged 
with  deep  crimson.  In  another  place  the  white  vapour 
which  clung  to  the  summits  of  the  mountains  assumed, 


184  MEMORIAL  TRIBUTE 

where  opposed  to  the  sunbeams,  a  roseate  hue  of  the 
greatest  delicacy.  From  a  small  lake  in  a  rocky  corrie, 
five  or  six  miles  distant,  a  white  streamlet  poured  down 
an  Alpine  valley  bounded  by  precipitous  crags.  In  the 
west,  through  an  opening  of  the  clouds,  was  seen  a 
range  of  lofty  mountains,  rising  behind  each  other,  the 
most  distant  being  probably  fifty  miles  off.  To  the 
west  and  north  -  west  the  mountains  continued  un- 
diminished  in  size  as  far  as  the  eye  could  reach,  but  to 
the  east  they  rapidly  diminished.  The  desolate  ranges 
of  Braemar  have  a  solemn  grandeur  independently  of 
atmospheric  drapery,  but  partially  enveloped  in  massy 
clouds,  or  overhung  with  a  wavy  curtain  of  gorgeously 
tinted  vapour,  their  glories  are  superbly  enhanced. 
But  by  degrees  the  purple  and  burnished  gold  and 
roseate  hues  faded  away  into  dull  bluish  grey,  dimness 
crept  over  the  mountains,  and  my  home  was  eight  miles 
distant. — Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  124. 


31. — AGED  BIRCH  TREES. 

In  ascending  a  valley  towards  the  higher  grounds, 
and  after  passing  through  a  birch  wood,  you  come  upon 
scattered  trees,  having  an  aged  aspect,  and  stunted 
dimensions.  Some  are  yet  vigorous  in  their  old  age ; 
others,  gnarled  and  knotted,  with  torn  and  ragged  bark, 
partially  denuded  and  decayed  wood  and  thinly -clad 
branches.  Many  vicissitudes  have  these  aged  denizens 
of  the  forest  seen :  sunshine  and  gloom,  calm  and 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  185 

tempest ;  the  enlivening  heat  of  summer  and  the 
cramping  frosts  of  winter  have  come  over  them — how 
often  one  cannot  tell.  In  the  midst  of  them  has  the 
half-savage  Celt  of  the  olden  time  shot  his  arrow  into 
the  stately  stag ;  and  but  yesterday  has  the  smooth- 
faced and  trimly-clad  Saxon  sent  from  his  rifle,  as  he 
leant  against  one  of  their  trunks,  the  whizzing  messenger 
of  death  to  the  herd  that  reposed  in  peace  upon  the 
mossy  knoll.  Farther  on,  many  trees  lie  prostrate  on 
the  hillside  among  a  scattered  group  of  melancholy 
survivors ;  and  yet  farther  up  the  valley  the  ground  is 
covered  with  trunks,  erect,  but  decayed,  broken  down, 
shaggy  with  moss  and  lichen,  rotten  to  the  core,  and 
crumbling  under  the  action  of  the  weather.  Said  I  not 
well,  that  trees  harmonise  with  human  feelings  ?  He 
who  for  the  hundredth  time  could  pass  by  such  a  scene 
and  not  experience  its  depressing  effect  must  have  a 
heart  unfit  for  any  gentle  emotion.  A  trumpet  could 
not  more  forcibly  proclaim  the  inevitable  death  of  all 
organic  being  than  do  these  lifeless  and  silent  monu- 
ments of  ruin. — Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  169. 


32. — THE  WIND  IN  THE  BEALLACH-BHUI 
FOREST. 

Once  more  in  the  Beallach-bhui  forest,  I  seat  myself 
on  a  mossy  bank  and  gaze  around.  I  am  in  the  middle 
of  a  seeming  amphitheatre  of  hills,  formed  of  ranges 
extending  from  Craig  Clunie,  on  the  right,  up  to  the 


186  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

crags  of  Lochnaneun,  on  the  shoulder  of  Lochnagar, 
and  a  ridge  descending,  on  the  left,  from  that  mountain 
down  to  the  Dee.  Beyond  the  river,  northward,  is  seen 
the  rugged  and  partly  wooded  face  of  a  brown  hill, 
forming  a  kind  of  corrie,  and  a  pine  wood  extending 
from  it.  But  that  all  on  that  side  may  be  excluded 
from  the  scene,  we  turn  from  it. 

There  is  a  sprinkling  of  birch  in  the  lower  parts  of 
the  forest,  and  here  and  there  along  the  hills  ;  but  pines, 
stately  and  solemn,  rear  their  columnar  stems  around, 
some  of  giant  stature,  but  the  greater  number  of  ordinary 
size ;  all,  however,  healthy  and  vigorous.  Here,  in  the 
wood,  the  sunbeams  glance  upon  us ;  for  there  is  no 
continuous  obscuration  of  the  sky  by  the  foliage ;  but 
far  up  the  valley,  and  along  the  hills,  the  trees  seem 
crowded  into  masses  of  dark  verdure.  The  breezes,  as 
they  sweep  over  the  woods,  sound  like  the  noise  of  the 
ocean- wave,  as  they  dash  upon  a  distant  rock.  Suddenly 
a  rushing  sound  is  heard  coming  from  afar.  It  advances, 
and,  as  it  passes  by,  resembles  the  roar  of  a  mighty  flood. 
A  blast  from  the  mountain -pass  has  swept  over  the 
forest,  bending  the  stiff  tops  of  the  lofty  pines.  Were 
a  hurricane,  or  even  a  winter  tempest,  to  invade  the 
valley,  rending  off  the  massy  limbs,  and  prostrating  the 
old  trunks,  the  scene  would  be  terrific.  We  may  fancy, 
too,  the  magnificence  of  a  protracted  thunder-storm — 
impenetrable  gloom  over  all  the  forests,  lightnings 
blazing,  and  thunders  crashing  ;  but  I  have  never  found 
imaginary  scenes  so  instructive  as  real  occurrences,  and 
that  chiefly  because  they  are  radically  unreal,  and  one 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  187 

knows  them  to  be  so.  The  wind  has  ceased,  and  the 
forest  rests  in  solemn  stillness.  You  can  see  far  away 
into  the  forest,  between  the  stems,  which  are  destitute 
of  branches  to  a  great  height.  Here  the  ground  is 
covered  with  luxuriant  tufts  of  heather  in  full  bloom ; 
there  the  stones  are  coated  with  moss  and  lichens  ;  and 
on  that  low  knoll  the  continuous  verdure  is  due  to  the 
yet  fresh  leaves  of  the  Vacdnium  myrtillus. — Natural 
History  of  Deeside,  p.  178. 


33. — MERRY-MAKING  OF  BIRDS. 

The  sun  sent  a  gleam  of  light  through  the  Pass  of 
Ballater  into  the  plain,  and  illumined  the  hill-tops  on 
the  western  side,  while  their  shadows  spread  far  over 
the  fields.  The  hill  along  the  base  of  which  I  walked 
is  covered  with  pines,  and,  partly,  opposite  the  village, 
with  birches.  Great  numbers  of  chaffinches  flew  along 
from  tree  to  tree,  apparently  enjoying  the  sunshine, 
occasionally  chasing  each  other,  and  engaging  in  mimic 
conflicts.  I  was  drawn  into  the  wood  by  hearing  a 
singular  chorus  of  many  shrill  voices  in  the  trees,  and, 
looking  up,  observed  a  multitude  of  little  birds  of  several 
species  frisking  about  in  great  glee.  Most  of  them 
were  coal-tits,  ringlets,  blue  tits,  and  willow-wrens  ;  but 
there  were  also  many  chaffinches,  and  some  common 
linnets.  Great  numbers  of  ringlets  occurred  in  other 
parts  of  the  wood.  I  was  amused  with  the  movements 
of  a  pair  of  coal-tits,  which  separated  from  the  rest,  and 


188  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

betook  themselves  to  an  excavation  in  the  diluvium, 
from  the  turf  margin  of  which  there  hung  a  number  of 
slender  tree-roots.  One  of  the  tits  flew  in  among  them, 
frisked  from  one  to  another,  clung  to  a  long  filament, 
and  appeared  to  enjoy  the  motion,  as  it  swayed  back- 
wards and  forwards.  The  other  bird  then  joined  it,  and 
they  seemed  content  for  a  while  to  amuse  themselves 
apart  from  their  companions.  There  was  a  general 
merry-making  among  the  little  birds.  They  seemed, 
after  the  labours  of  the  day,  old  and  young  together,  to 
indulge  in  frolic  before  retiring  to  rest. 

Many  species  of  mammalia,  birds,  and  fishes,  evi- 
dently pass  a  portion  of  their  time  in  sport.  Young 
animals  are  especially  addicted  to  romping,  as  may  be 
seen  in  foals,  calves,  and  especially  lambs  and  kids,  as 
well  as  puppies  and  kittens.  The  same  is  observed  in 
birds,  wild  and  domestic,  in  hawks,  rooks,  finches,  and 
poultry.  No  birds  are  more  gracefully  sportive  than 
ducks  of  all  kinds  are  on  the  water.  Not  the  gentle 
only,  but  also  the  ferocious,  enjoy  themselves  in  this 
manner.  Eagles  and  ravens  I  have  often  seen  wheeling 
and  gliding  through  the  air  in  sport,  while  they  gave 
expression  to  their  delight  in  loud  and  modulated  cries. 
— Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  184. 


34. — THE  HIGHLAND  Moon. 

Leaning  against  a  cairn  constructed  of  angular  stones 
of  grey  porphyry,  supplied  by  a  heap  close  at  hand,  I 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  189 

survey  an  extensive  tract  of  mountain  and  moor.  The 
sun,  shining  clear  in  a  cloudless  pale  blue  sky,  gives 
some  warmth  to  my  right  side,  while  a  breeze  from  the 
north-east  comes  whirling  at  times  round  the  cairn, 
chilling  me  with  its  piercing  blasts.  It  is  the  4th  of 
September,  near  sunset.  I  stand  in  the  midst  of  a 
region  which  might  be  thought  one  of  stillness  and 
desolation,  were  it  not  that  symptoms  of  human  life  are 
seen  in  five  little  patches  of  cultivated  land,  and  a  group 
of  black  huts  in  a  hollow,  from  one  to  two  miles  distant. 
Yet  the  range  of  vision  is  not  less  than  fifty  miles  in  one 
direction.  Just  behind  me  are  the  summits  of  a  hill 
range,  not  more  than  a  mile  distant,  beyond  which 
nothing  is  to  be  seen  ;  and  therefore  I  have  turned  my 
back  upon  them.  To  the  left  is  a  rounded  hill,  running 
down  into  a  smooth  ridge,  over  a  depression  in  which 
are  seen  the  hills  beyond  Ballater,  topped  by  the  conical 
summit  of  the  more  distant  Mount  Keen,  singularly 
white  in  the  pale  rays  of  the  western  sun.  Low  ranges 
extend  from  it,  until  there  rises,  in  the  south,  the  massive 
form  of  Lochnagar — both  its  corries  conspicuously  dis- 
played ;  the  western  illuminated,  the  eastern  in  deep 
impenetrable  shade,  veiled  by  a  filmy  grey  vapour.  A 
most  beautiful  undulated  ridgy  descent  leads  the  eye  to 
the  Glen  Ballater  mountains,  the  Beallach-bhui,  and  the 
Braemar  hills  as  far  as  the  upper  part  of  Glen  Ey.  The 
great  mountain  stands  conspicuous  in  its  massy  breadth 
and  towering  height,  as  if  upheaved  beyond  its  ordinary 
elevation.  At  its  base,  near  Loch  Muic,  is  a  large 
rounded  hill ;  but  elsewhere,  all  down  to  the  Dee,  the 


190  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

ground  seems  low,  presenting  only  some  undulations, 
which,  although  really  of  some  considerable  height,  are 
scarcely  noticeable  from  our  present  station.  On  this 
side  of  the  Dee,  the  position  of  which  is  known  only  by 
recollection,  is  a  range  of  low  hills,  undulated  in  its 
outline,  but  high  enough  to  prevent  us  from  seeing 
those  hills  that  seemed  mountains  to  us  as  we  traversed 
the  valley.  Where  the  Braemar  mingle  with  the  Atholl 
ranges  in  the  extreme  distance,  the  horizon  is  next 
bounded  by  a  roundish  hill,  only  about  five  miles  distant. 
Then  Ben  Aun  rising  behind,  with  its  long  unwaved, 
but  curiously  knobbed  ridge,  leads  us  to  the  blaze  of 
the  western  sun,  just  passing  behind  the  broad  head  of 
the  Bho-dhoun,  which,  at  only  the  distance  of  two  miles, 
seems  continuous  with  the  hill  on  which  we  stand.  The 
long  shadows  cast  upon  the  grey  and  brown  moors  by 
the  many  prominences  of  the  Lochnagar  group  have  a 
singular  and  rather  perplexing  effect ;  for  they  give  the 
well-known  tract  an  aspect  different  from  any  under 
which  we  have  contemplated  it,  whether  in  the  sunshine 
of  noontide,  the  diffused  light  of  a  cloudy  day,  or  when 
the  summits,  involved  in  vapours,  hid  themselves  from 
our  view,  and  the  bases  of  the  mountains  seemed  more 
massy  than  they  ever  do  when  their  entire  forms  are 
disclosed. 

But  now,  over  the  ridge  of  Ben  Aun,  creeps  a  thin 
and  flaky  mass  of  vapour,  glowing  on  its  northern  side 
with  a  roseate  tint ;  purplish  rays  diverge  from  behind 
the  brown  hill  to  our  right ;  the  white  summit  of  Mona- 
Chuine  has  assumed  a  roseate  hue,  and  Lochnagar  is 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  191 

tinged  with  a  pale  purplish  blue.  Beautifully  delicate 
are  the  tints  of  the  few  fleecy  cloudlets  that  rise  in  the 
north-west ;  but  the  setting  sun  assumes  no  imposing 
glory,  and  as  he  passes  on  seems  to  smile  a  gentle  good- 
night on  the  brown  moors  of  Glen  Gairn. 

The  red  grouse  call  to  each  other  on  the  hill-side ; 
here,  a  solitary  grey  hare  bounds  quietly  among  the 
short  heather,  stops  to  listen  and  look  around,  then 
pursues  its  way ;  some  hooded  crows,  that  have  been 
prowling  about,  are  flying  down  the  little  valley  ;  dimness 
envelops  the  low  grounds,  then  the  bases  of  the  hills, 
creeping  upwards,  slowly,  imperceptibly,  but  surely,  like 
age  and  time,  ever  moving  onward,  and  involving  all 
things  in  darkness.  There  is  now  no  sound  but  the 
sighing  of  the  breeze  ;  and  as  we  descend  over  the  long 
smooth  declivity,  clad  with  thick  heather,  we  pause  not 
to  listen  to  the  hum  of  distant  waterfalls,  or  the  shriek 
of  the  white  owl,  for  no  torrents  rush  over  these  moors, 
nor  ruined  towers  rise  on  the  brown  hills,  where  the 
gor-cock  (Lagopus  scoticus),  escaped  from  the  gun  of 
the  unpitying  sportsman,  crouches  with  the  remnant  of 
his  family. — Natural  History  of  Deeside,  pp.  207,  208. 


35. — THREE  PINE  TREES. 

Three  stunted  trees  among  rubbish  have  a  most 
singular  effect.  One  can  hardly  believe  his  eyes  when 
they  tell  him  they  are  pines.  How  came  they  there  ? 
What  is  their  purpose  ?  Why  are  there  not  more  of 


192  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

them  ?  How  old  are  they  ?  Very  easy  it  is  to  ask 
questions  which  nobody  can  answer.  A  fourth  tree 
has  grown  there  also,  but  it  lies  overthrown,  unbarked, 
and  rotting.  Their  bent  and  rugged  trunks  indicate 
poverty  and  old  age.  Many  storms  of  wind  and  rain 
have  burst  upon  them ;  the  sun  has  blazed  fiercely 
upon  their  tufted  foliage,  and  the  parched  crags  have 
sent  back  his  rays  upon  their  spreading  branches. 
The  snows  of  winter  have  pressed  them  down,  and 
the  sapless  soil  has  refused  them  nourishment  in 
summer ;  their  kindred  have  perished  one  by  one  ;  the 
last  of  their  brethren  lies  prostrate  beside  them ;  they 
are  the  remnants  of  a  once  numerous  and  prosperous 
race,  and  when  they  perish  there  will  be  no  monument 
but  this  passing  notice  to  indicate  that  they  once 
were. — Natural  History  of  Deeside,  p.  239. 


36. — RAVENS — POOR  FELLOWS  ! 

The  path  leads  along  the  base  of  the  furrowed  and 
stony  declivities,  which  are  of  granite,  coarse  and 
reddish,  like  that  of  the  opposite  side.  All  along  this 
passage  it  was  very  pleasant  to  hear  the  ravens,  in 
the  crags  of  the  opposite  side,  talking  to  each  other 
in  a  great  variety  of  accents,  one  answering  the  call  of 
another.  Poor  fellows  !  if  the  glen  were  mine  I  would 
give  strict  orders  not  to  molest  them ;  for,  next  to 
the  eagle,  now  altogether  destroyed,  the  raven  is  the 
greatest  ornament  of  such  a  scene.  They  continued 


BIRD   LIFE,  ETC.  193 

croaking,  barking,  yelping  at  a  great  rate  until  I  had 
passed  the  end  of  the  rock. — Natural  History  of 
Deeside,  p.  252. 


37. — HOME. 

But  it  is  now  getting  toward  six  o'clock,  and,  as  my 
resting-place  is  a  good  way  off,  it  is  time  to  proceed. 
When  I  ascended  the  valley  of  the  Dee,  in  the  end 
of  July,  the  woods  rejoiced  in  the  warm  breezes,  and 
spread  their  green  foliage  to  the  sun.  Now,  in  the 
middle  of  September,  they  seem  preparing  for  the 
winter;  their  discoloured  and  sapless  leaves,  smitten 
by  the  night-frosts  and  seared  by  the  drought,  show 
no  gladness,  but  speak  of  decay  —  beautiful  in  its 
gradations,  like  the  passage  of  the  aged  Christian  to 
the  grave,  and  very  pleasing  to  the  sobered  and  con- 
templative mind.  I  have  this  year  seen  these  woods 
of  Crathes,  when  their  twigs  bore  nothing  but  buds, 
when  their  tender  leaves  were  unfolding,  when  their 
foliage  covered  them  as  a  mantle ;  and  now,  in  passing, 
I  observe  them  streaked  and  patched  with  the  yellow 
tints  of  autumn.  Winter  will  again  strip  them  of  all 
their  vesture ;  but  they  "  will  hear  the  voice  of  spring 
and  flourish  green  again."  So  shall  we,  whose  life  is 
Christ. 

An  easterly  wind,  not  cold  and  penetrating,  brings 
up  the  clouds  successively  from  the  Celtic  sea.  But 
scarcely  any  rain  falls,  and  at  intervals  the  moon  is 

o 


194  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

seen  dimly  defined  through  the  grey  vapour.  Farmers 
are  returning  in  carts  and  gigs  from  the  market, 
it  being  Friday ;  but  otherwise  the  road  is  dull,  it 
being  much  less  frequented  at  any  time  than  that  on 
the  north  side. 

Not  an  inn  nor  a  shop  could  I  find  anywhere,  and 
having  neither  eaten  nor  drunk  since  twelve  o'clock, 
I  resolved,  on  reaching  Maryculter,  to  make  applica- 
tion for  tea  and  bread,  the  favourite  food  of  sedentary 
people,  and  assuredly  the  most  invigorating  of  all  to 
the  wearied  pedestrian.  How  much  refreshed  I  felt 
after  an  hour's  rest  and  a  plentiful  meal,  any  one 
may  understand  who  has  an  elastic  temperament. 
The  milestones  which  I  had  been  counting  were  no 
longer  consulted ;  and  as  little  of  the  well-known 
scenery  was  visible  under  the  faint  light  of  the  moon, 
veiled  by  the  grey  vapours,  I  mused  on  many  things 
as  I  walked  quickly  along. 

The  Divine  Providence  has  rendered  my  path 
pleasant  to  me  in  the  rugged  corrie,  in  the  thick 
wood,  and  in  the  green  valley ;  has  prepared  friends 
to  forward  my  views,  to  protect  me  under  their 
hospitable  roofs  and  instruct  me  by  their  conversation  ; 
has  restored  me  to  health,  and  preserved  it  to  me ; 
has  enabled  me  to  accomplish  the  purpose  of  my 
journey,  and  filled  me  with  gratitude  now  that  I 
approach  its  termination. 

Kind  reader  I  it  is  time  to  bid  thee  "  Good-night."

38. — SCENE  AT  TORQUAY. 

It  is  well  that  the  observations  from  which  these 
descriptions  have  been  prepared  were  made  many 
years  ago,  when  I  was  full  of  enthusiasm,  and  enjoyed 
the  blessings  of  health  and  freedom  from  engrossing 
public  duties ;  for  I  am  persuaded  that  now  I  should 
be  in  some  respects  less  qualified  for  the  task,  more, 
however,  from  the  failure  of  physical  than  of  mental 
power.  Here,  on  the  rocky  promontory,  I  shiver  in 
the  breeze  which,  to  my  companion,  is  but  cool  and 
bracing.  The  east  wind  ruffles  the  sea,  and  impels 
the  little  waves  to  the  shores  of  the  beautiful  bay, 
which  present  alternate  cliffs  of  red  sandstone  and 
beaches  of  yellow  sand,  backed  by  undulated  heights 
and  gentle  acclivities,  slowly  rising  to  the  not  distant 
horizon,  fields  and  woods,  with  villages  and  scattered 
villas  forming — not  wild  nor  altogether  tame — a  pleas- 
ing landscape  which,  in  its  summer  and  autumn 
garniture  of  grass  and  corn,  and  sylvan  verdure, 
orchard  blossom  and  fruit,  tangled  fence -bank  and 
furze-clad  common,  will  be  beautiful  indeed  to  the 
lover  of  Nature.  Then  the  balmy  breezes  from  the 
west  and  south  will  waft  health  to  the  reviving 
invalid.  At  present  the  cold  vernal  gales  sweep  along 
the  channel,  conveying  to  its  haven  the  extended 
fleet  of  boats  that  render  Brixham,  on  the  opposite 
horn  of  the  bay,  one  of  the  most  celebrated  of  the 
southern  fishing-stations  of  England.  High  over  the 


196  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

waters,  here  and  there,  a  solitary  gull  slowly  advances 
against  the  breeze,  or  shoots  athwart,  or  with  a  beautiful 
gliding  motion  sweeps  down  the  aerial  current.  At 
the  entrance  to  Torquay  are  assembled  many  birds  of 
the  same  kind  which,  by  their  hovering  near  the 
surface,  their  varied  evolutions  and  mingling  cries, 
indicate  a  shoal,  probably  of  atherines  or  sprats.  On 
that  little  pyramidal  rock,  projecting  from  the  water, 
repose  two  dusky  cormorants ;  and,  far  away,  in  the 
direction  of  Portland  Island,  a  gannet,  well  known  by 
its  peculiar  flight,  winnows  its  exploring  way,  and 
plunges  headlong  into  the  deep.  But  neither  time 
nor  place  are  favourable  to  the  observation  of  the 
wading  tribes,  although  the  country  around  supplies 
the  greater  number  of  those  found  in  Britain. — British 
Birds,  vol.  iv.  p.  viii.

LIFE'S   WORK   ENDED 

CONCLUSION. 

I  HAVE  finished  one  of  the  many  difficult  and  laborious 
tasks  which  I  had  imposed  upon  myself.  Twelve 
years  have  elapsed  since  the  first  three  volumes  of 
this  work  were  issued  to  the  public,  and  I  had 
scarcely  hoped  to  see  its  completion,  when  I  was 
most  unexpectedly  encouraged  to  revise  the  manu- 
script of  the  two  remaining  volumes,  containing  the 
wading  and  swimming  birds,  of  which  the  history, 
in  so  far  as  I  am  acquainted  with  it,  is  now  given  on 
the  same  plan  as  that  adopted  for  the  land  birds. 
Commenced  in  hope,  and  carried  on  with  zeal,  though 
ended  in  sorrow  and  sickness,  I  can  look  upon  my 
work  without  much  regard  to  the  opinions  which 
contemporary  writers  may  form  of  it,  assured  that 
what  is  useful  in  it  will  not  be  forgotten,  and  knowing 
that  already  it  has  had  a  beneficial  effect  on  many  of 
the  present,  and  will  more  powerfully  influence  the 
next,  generation  of  our  home-ornithologists.  I  had 

o2 


198  MEMORIAL   TRIBUTE 

been  led  to  think  that  I  had  occasionally  been  some- 
what rude,  or  at  least  blunt,  in  my  criticisms ;  but  I 
do  not  perceive  wherein  I  have  much  erred  in  that 
respect,  and  I  feel  no  inclination  to  apologise.  I  have 
been  honest  and  sincere  in  my  endeavours  to  promote 
the  truth.  With  death,  apparently  not  distant,  before 
my  eyes,  I  am  pleased  to  think  that  I  have  not 
countenanced  error  through  fear  or  favour.  Neither 
have  I  in  any  case  modified  my  sentiments  so  as  to 
endeavour  thereby  to  conceal  or  palliate  my  faults. 
Though  I  might  have  accomplished  more,  I  am 
thankful  for  having  been  permitted  to  add  very  con- 
siderably to  the  knowledge  previously  obtained  of  a 
very  pleasant  subject.  If  I  have  not  very  frequently 
indulged  in  reflections  on  the  power,  wisdom,  and 
goodness  of  God,  as  suggested  by  even  my  imperfect 
understanding  of  His  wonderful  works,  it  is  not  be- 
cause I  have  not  ever  been  sensible  of  the  relation 
between  the  Creator  and  His  creatures,  nor  because 
my  chief  enjoyment,  when  wandering  among  the  hills 
and  valleys,  exploring  the  rugged  shores  of  the  ocean, 
or  searching  the  cultivated  fields,  has  not  been  in  a 
sense  of  His  presence.  "To  Him  who  alone  doeth 
great  wonders "  be  all  glory  and  praise.  Reader, 
farewell ! — British  Birds.,  vol.  v.,  "  Conclusion."
