From a democracy in the 1950s, Iran seems to have moved backwards, from an authoritarian regime (backed by Britain and the US) that overthrew the democratic one, to a religious fundamentalist regime toppling the authoritarian one and taking an anti-US stance.</p><p>The US ended its support for Iran and instead supported Iraq in a brutal war through the 1980s against Iran where over 1 million people died. More recently, Iran was described as being part of an “axis of evil” by US President George Bush, as part of his “war on terror.”</p><p>The US has also accused Iran of pursuing the development of nuclear weapons, while Iran says it is only pursuing peaceful development. Internally, movements towards moderate policies and democratic values are gaining traction, but not with hardliners in power trying to hold on. This section looks into these and related issues.</p><figure><img src="https://static.globalissues.org/i/countries/mideast.gif" loading="lazy" width="463" height="461" alt="Map of the Middle East" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/printpage/measiamain.htm">World Atlas</a></figcaption></figure><section id="toc" class="box" role="directory"><h2>On this page:</h2><ol><li><a href="#BriefPostWorldWarIIOverview">Brief Post World War II Overview</a><ol><li><a href="#USandBritainOverthrowDemocraticallyElectedLeaderin1950sandInstalltheShah">US and Britain Overthrow Democratically Elected Leader in 1950s and Install the Shah</a></li><li><a href="#ShahsauthoritarianismleadstoIslamicFundamentalistsOverthrowingShah">Shah’s authoritarianism leads to Islamic Fundamentalists Overthrowing Shah</a></li><li><a href="#IranandIraqWarLeavesBothCountriesShattered">Iran and Iraq War Leaves Both Countries Shattered</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#RelationwithIsrael">Relation with Israel</a></li><li><a href="#USandIranThornyRelations">US and Iran: Thorny Relations</a><ol><li><a href="#USarmedIranwhilesupportingIraq">US armed Iran while supporting Iraq</a></li><li><a href="#USaccusesIranofbeingintheAxisofEvil">US accuses Iran of being in the Axis of Evil</a></li><li><a href="#USaccusesIranofdevelopingnuclearweapons">US accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons</a></li><li><a href="#SpinDiplomacyandUseofFear">Spin, “Diplomacy”, and Use of Fear</a></li><li><a href="#USliesandexaggeratesaboutextentofnucleardevelopment">US lies and exaggerates about extent of nuclear development</a></li><li><a href="#USandIAEAhavesofarbeenunabletoproveIranisdevelopingnuclearweapons">US and IAEA have so far been unable to prove Iran is developing nuclear weapons</a></li><li><a href="#Regurgitatingoldstoriesasnewinformationtojustifysanctions">Regurgitating old stories as new information to justify sanctions?</a></li><li><a href="#USinitiallyprovidedIrannuclearknow-how">US initially provided Iran nuclear know-how</a></li><li><a href="#USIndiaandIran">US, India, and Iran</a><ol><li><a href="#FormerseniorUSBushAdministrationofficialadmitsIndiasvoteagainstIranwascoerced">Former senior US Bush Administration official admits India’s vote against Iran was coerced</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#IstheUSunderminingtheIAEA">Is the US undermining the IAEA?</a></li><li><a href="#USletsEuropenegotiatewithIran">US lets Europe negotiate with Iran</a></li><li><a href="#IrantakesBritishSoldiersHostage">Iran takes British Soldiers Hostage</a></li><li><a href="#USwarwithIran">US war with Iran?</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#IransrealpoliciesandactionscomplicateBushsposition">Iran’s real policies and actions complicate Bush’s position</a><ol><li><a href="#AhmadinejaddoesnotactuallyhavemuchpowerSupremeLeaderdoes">Ahmadinejad does not actually have much power.

In the 1920s, Reza Shah Pahlavi staged a coup against the ruling dynasty and embarked on a modernization drive, building industry, railroads, national education, etc. His autocratic rule however, was disliked.</p><p>During World War II, in order to prevent a potential pro-Nazi coup orchestrated by the Axis powers, the Soviet Union and Britain invaded Iran securing the petroleum infrastructure. Seeing the Shah’s son as being more supportive, the Allies forced the Shah to step aside. Iran became a major route of arms from Allies in the west, to the Soviets during the war.</p><p>In 1951, a pro-democracy nationalist, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh rose to prominence in Iran and was democratically elected as Iran’s first Prime Minister. In 1953, the Mossadegh government chose to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later renamed to the British Petroleum Company, now known as BP), which controlled of the nation’s oil reserves, feeling that proceeds from oil should be used to invest in the development of Iran, rather than siphoned off as profits.</p><p>This was a risky move by Iran, for they would risked the wrath of the British who stood to lose a lot of power, wealth and influence gained via control of such a major energy source.</p><p>However, this move to nationalize such an industry has to be taken in context: This was at a time amid global feelings of nationalism, with both burgeoning and fledgling movements to oust former colonial rulers who had weakened themselves during the Second World War as they fought each other. <a href="http://www.ied.info/books/ed/breakingfree.html" title="External Link: J.W. Smith, ‘The World Breaking Free frightened the Security Councils of every Western Nation’, Economic Democracy; The Political Struggle for the 21st Century (4th Edition, Institute for Economic Democracy Press, 2005)">The “third world” had seen its chance to break free</a>, and so feelings of nationalism and revolution were ripe around the world.</p><p>Iran was one of the few early successful democratic regimes, though development would be a challenge. Nationalizing the oil company was therefore part of this drive for non-alignment away from the superpowers’ influence.</p><p>For Britain, this was another “nail in the coffin” of their once great empire that stretched across the globe. Having “lost” their prime jewel, India, a few years earlier, their world status was unofficially reduced and no longer were they the great empire. Losing other places around the world must have been quite shocking and disappointing to those who still held colonial attitudes. However, they had partnered with a new power that had risen during the Second World War: the US.</p><p>As explained in the Control of Resources section in more depth, the US now took on a role to help transform the global system into one that it could dominate but also help rebuild Europe to stave off a rising “Communist threat.”</p><p>Furthermore, as J.W. Smith puts it (see previous link), the “populations on the periphery of empire who provided their cheap resources [were] taking the rhetoric of democracy seriously and breaking free,” which alarmed historic colonial empires.</p><p>Breakaway countries posed the threat that they may side with the Soviets, rather than be associated with the West, due to the feelings of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism.</p><p>Other countries, while breaking away from colonialism, may not have necessarily defected to the Soviet side, but may have attempted an independent form of development.</p><p>Iran’s nationalizing of the oil company signaled such a threat, for it was important to Britain’s wealth. Like so many other countries throughout the world in the 1950s, 60s and 70s and even 80s, popular regimes that were, or showed, democratic tendencies were treated with suspicion, for fear of “going Communist.”</p><p>Sometimes this fear would be used as an excuse to get involved in those countries for other reasons (usually economic and geopolitical ones, to continue the traditions of imperial adventures and colonial aspirations of control and dominance).</p><p>Hence, the US and Europe supported and tolerated so many dictatorships, for puppet regimes were easier to control and manipulate, and they could put their own populations in order, rather than US and Europe resorting to (too many) expensive wars. Of course, where it was deemed necessary, as always happens throughout history, military might would be employed (Vietnam being one vivid example).</p><p>After Mossadegh’s announcement of the nationalization of the oil industry, Britain responded with an embargo. The embargo had serious effects on the economy, thus allowing criticism against Mossadegh to fester. Convincing the US of a communist link, Britain managed to get the US to agree to deal with Iran. Operation Ajax, a CIA-backed plot, allowed the Shah’s son, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, to overthrow Mossadegh.</p><p>This operation involved a lot of illegal propaganda in a foreign country (unfortunately not uncommon), which Dan De Luce, of the British newspaper, <cite>the Guardian</cite> summarized:</p><figure class="pull-quote"><blockquote><p>The CIA—with British assistance—undermined Mossadegh’s government by bribing influential figures, planting false reports in newspapers and provoking street violence. Led by an agent named Kermit Roosevelt, the grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, the CIA leaned on a young, insecure Shah to issue a decree dismissing Mossadegh as prime minister. By the end of Operation Ajax, some 300 people had died in firefights in the streets of Tehran.</p><p>The crushing of Iran’s first democratic government ushered in more than two decades of dictatorship under the Shah, who relied heavily on US aid and arms. The anti-American backlash that toppled the Shah in 1979 shook the whole region and helped spread Islamic militancy, with Iran’s new hardline theocracy declaring undying hostility to the US.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Dan De Luce, <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9115,1022066,00.html">The Specter of Operation Ajax</a>, The Guardian, August 20, 2003</cite></figcaption></figure><p>For roughly a quarter-century, Iran suffered repressive and autocratic rule by the Shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. He was seen by the West favorably for he had a Western education and liked many aspects of “modernism” (though not democracy, it would appear).</p></section><section><h3 id="ShahsauthoritarianismleadstoIslamicFundamentalistsOverthrowingShah">Shah’s authoritarianism leads to Islamic Fundamentalists Overthrowing Shah</h3><p>The Shah’s rule seemed paradoxical for some. While he supported women’s rights, extending suffrage to them, he also supported royalists in Yemen’s civil war. He maintained close diplomatic relations with both Saudi Arabia and Israel. He also instituted land reform which wrestled away land from some elites, with the idea of redistributing it to small farmers.</p><p>However, corruption and lack of sufficient land caused resentment among many farmers. The Islamic clergy also saw various sources of their power diminishing, as clergy were also required to pass examinations, and as family and educational systems underwent changes. </p><p>However, rather than democratizing, the Shah instituted one-party rule, stating concerns and fears of a communist party taking power. His authoritarian rule caused much controversy. The religious clergy were therefore able to gather a lot of support.</p><p>The excesses of the Shah’s authoritarian rule fueled what eventually became the Iranian Revolution of February 1979 which saw his overthrow.</p><p>However, one autocratic regime was replaced by another. This revolution, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, ushered in rule by a conservative religious clergy, the mullahs, and saw Iran become the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><p>A documentary on <cite>PBS</cite> in 2000 (unfortunately I do not recall the name) revealed that many people had supported the revolution and overthrow of the Shah, including many women, indicating how bad life was under the Shah. They were however eventually disillusioned by the religious clergy they had supported for not fulfilling many promises they thought they would. Many women interviewed regretted how their lives had become more oppressed, for example.</p><p>Iranian students held US embassy personnel hostage for over a year, accusing them of trying to overthrow the revolutionary government and reinstall the shah. Khomeini encouraged the hostage crisis, rather than stop it, and this episode marked the beginning of thorny relations with the US, who feared Iran not so much militarily, but from its potential ability to export Islamic revolutions all over the Middle East, threatening the “stability” that the US had created for itself.</p><p>Neighboring Iraq also saw an opportunity to gain more power, as Khomeini had disbanded the once mighty military.</p><p>Just as Christianity has many branches, such as Catholicism and Protestantism, so too does Islam, with Shia and Sunni Muslims. Furthermore, culturally, Iranians are not Arabs like Iraqis are, and historically, Iraq (as Mesopotamia) and Iran (as Persia) had often been involved in conflicts, wars, and territorial disputes. The 1980s looked set to continue that pattern, as many of these these cultural and religious differences contributed to their terribly costly and destructive war of the 80s, known as the Persian Gulf War.</p></section><section><h3 id="IranandIraqWarLeavesBothCountriesShattered">Iran and Iraq War Leaves Both Countries Shattered</h3><p>Iran and Iraq have had border disputes for centuries. These ultimately spilled into a terrible war from 1980 to 1988 that witnessed all sorts of war crimes from both sides. This war cost 1 million casualties in Iran alone, and over $1 trillion between the two countries.</p><p>The US and the Reagan regime supported Iraq and then ruler, Saddam Hussein, because Iran’s Islamic Revolution had seen their favored “puppet regime” in Iran overthrown. Providing military, economic, and political assistance to Iraq, Saddam Hussein’s army waged a long war.</p><p>Both sides attacked each other’s oil tankers (and even tankers belonging to countries not involved in the conflict—Iran attacked other Arab countries’ tankers for example). Both also attacked each others’ cities, and as has been thoroughly discussed now in the build up to the US war on Iraq, Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) against Iran.</p><p>Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, perhaps with ambitions to be the leading Arab nation and have a strong Middle East centered around Iraq, had been favored by the US in this war who were happy to ignore Iraqi war crimes, as from their point of view, defeat of Iran was paramount. </p><p>Later, Hussein’s ambitions to unite Arab lands under one large nation (with him as ruler no doubt) was one of the concerns raised in 1991 after he overstepped his bounds (as a dictator subservient to US ambitions in the region) and invaded Kuwait. US raised the specter of a Hitler or anti-Christ type of force in the region, that had to be quashed.</p><p>As David Gowan noted in his book, <cite>Global Gamble</cite>, (Verso, 1999) and J.W. Smith in his work on <cite>Economic Democracy</cite>, (IED Press, 2006), this was an example of one power (the US) not tolerating another power (a potentially enlarged Iraq or a united Arab people) for it threatened access to important resources—a major source for US world dominance. Having served its use, Iraq was to remain subservient again, or face repercussions.</p><p>Political activist, Stephen Shalom, lists a time-line of the Iraq war from the perspective of US interest and notes the following key events:</p><figure class="pull-quote"><blockquote><p>When Iraq invades Iran, the U.S. opposes any Security Council action to condemn the invasion. U.S. soon removes Iraq from its list of nations supporting terrorism and allows U.S. arms to be transferred to Iraq. At the same time, U.S. lets Israel provide arms to Iran and in 1985 U.S. provides arms directly (though secretly) to Iran. U.S. provides intelligence information to Iraq. Iraq uses chemical weapons in 1984; U.S. restores diplomatic relations with Iraq. 1987 U.S. sends its navy into the Persian Gulf, taking Iraq’s side; an overly-aggressive U.S. ship shoots down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing 290.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Stephen Shalom, <a href="http://www.zmag.org/shalomhate.htm">The United States and Middle East—Why do “They” Hate Us?</a>, ZNet, December 12, 2001</cite></figcaption></figure><p>What is interesting about the above is that the US seemed to be involved in pitting both sides against each other. The Iran-Contra scandal (US selling arms to Iran and using proceeds to fund guerrillas in Nicaragua) revealed more murky goings on, that even saw Israel being the conduit for the arms sales (discussed further below). </p><p>Internationally, other actors also backed different sides in this war: the US, France, UK, Germany, many Arab countries (including Egypt and Saudi Arabia), China and the Soviet Union all backed Iraq in various ways, from providing chemical weapons, other military equipment, financing, and more. Support for Iran came from Syria, Libya, North Korea, Cuba, and Yugoslavia. (One can see how some wars since have reflected these “sides”. Iraq later overstepped its bounds and fell out of favor with the US, which is now well known.)</p><p>Commentators note that many Iranians look back to this period with anger and sadness at Western involvement against them and for not doing anything to stop the chemical warfare, and in effect being isolated internationally.</p></section><p class="top"><a class="arrow right-up" href="#globalissues-org">Back to top</a></p></section><section><h2 id="RelationwithIsrael">Relation with Israel</h2><p>Outside Israel, Iran has the largest Jewish population in the region. Many leading figures in Israel have come from Iran originally, as well.</p><p>Under the Shah, Israel enjoyed a good relationship with Iran. However, with the Islamic Revolution, the ruling clergy and Israel have had a more hostile relationship with Iran not recognizing Israel.</p><p>Yet, even during this non-relationship, Israel was used as a conduit by the United States to sell weapons to Iran as part of the Iran-Contra scandal (discussed further below).</p><p>In more recent years, as the US has stepped up criticism of Iran’s nuclear program as being a nuclear weapons program (discussed further below), <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1920074,00.html" title="External Link: Uzi Mahnaimi and Sarah Baxter, ‘Israel readies forces for strike on nuclear Iran’, The Sunday Times, December 11, 2005">Israel has planned for the possibility of taking out various missile and other targets in Iran</a>. <ins datetime="January 7, 2007"><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-2535310,00.html" title="External Link: Uzi Mahnaimi and Sarah Baxter, ‘Revealed: Israel plans nuclear strike on Iran’, The Sunday Times, January 7, 2007" id="idm92">Israel has also considered using tactical nuclear weapons to take out Iran’s nuclear facilities</a>, <cite>The Sunday Times</cite> reveals.</ins></p><p>Although it has not admitted it officially, Israel is widely believed to have 200-400 nuclear weapons and is the only nuclear power in the region. In the past it has bombed an Iraqi facility suspected of being part of a nuclear weapons program.</p><p>Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians and the overflow into South Lebanon gave rise to militant opposition, Hezbollah perhaps being the most well known amongst them. Regarded as a terrorist organization by many nations, Iran and some others feel it is an organization fighting a legitimate cause and has actively backed Hezbollah.</p><p>Fred Halliday, a noted expert on Middle East affairs and professor of international relations at the prestigious London School of Economics, had managed to talk to Hezbollah’s deputy head, and its political strategist, Sheikh Naim Qassem, who noted that <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization/hizbollah_3757.jsp" title="External Link: Fred Halliday, ‘A Lebanese fragment: two days with Hezbollah’, openDemocracy, July 20, 2006">Hezbollah regards the Iranian spiritual leader, in this case Khamenei, as its ultimate authority</a>. “All major political decisions regarding Hezbollah are referred to … Iran.”</p><p>The decision by Hezbollah to enter Lebanese politics in 1992, for example, was determined by “Ayatollah Khamenei himself who took the final decision, in favour of participation.”</p><p>Qassem also admitted helping Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside Israel and Palestine, even though they are Sunni Muslims, not Shi’a like Hezbollah. He also said Hezbollah’s actual activities were limited to within Lebanon, and the disputed area of the Shebaa farms near the Syrian border. If true, Iran isn’t directly supporting suicide bombers in Israel as some have claimed, though it could certainly be indirect.</p><p>However, Iran has constantly denounced Israel, and various rulers and leading officials have announced death to Israel in various forms.

However, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the US quickly moved to an aggressive stance against major countries it had long disliked, and labeled Iran as being part of an “Axis of Evil” trying to invoke the ominous image of Hitler and the “Axis powers.” At the same time US President George Bush called for a reinvigorated push for democracy (starting with an invasion of <a href="/Geopolitics/MiddleEast/Iraq.asp">Iraq</a>, that has now seen the country immersed in a civil war).</p><p>With Iran, however, this democratization push has had the reverse effect. By supporting outside forces and openly indicating it would fund opposition forces within Iran as well, the US helped push the Iranian ruling regime to a more aggressive and authoritarian position. As such, the reformist Khatami fell out of favor with the ruling clergy who backed the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president.

One of them was Radzhab Safarov, director of Moscow-based Center for Iranian Research, and an advisor to the Russian State Duma chairman. Safarov said that Russia “is not worried about allegations that Iran might possess technology of dual nature” because the “Iranian nuclear program has a completely peaceful nature, and there is no evidence to the contrary.”</p><p>He further notes that if Russia suspected a covert nuclear weapons program, Russia would “have blocked this project and suspended co-operation with Iran in this field, because it would have been against its own interests” as their common border in the Caspian sea would “threaten Russia’s national interests” in the area.</p><p>Safarov, also makes an interesting comment: “I don’t think any country has a right to interfere with the Iranian nuclear program, because it is a completely internal affair.” This is of interest for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>The “interference” is occurring because Iran is regarded by the Bush Administration as an enemy, part of what they call the “Axis of Evil”.

In 1957, Washington and Tehran signed their first civil nuclear cooperation agreement. Over the next two decades, the United States provided Iran not only with technical assistance but with its first experimental nuclear reactor, complete with enriched uranium and plutonium with fissile isotopes. Despite the refusal of the shah to rule out the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, the Ford administration approved the sale to Iran of up to eight nuclear reactors (with fuel) and later cleared the sale of lasers believed to be capable of enriching uranium. Surpassing any danger from the mullahs now in power, the shah’s megalomania led arms control advocates to fear a diversion of the technology for military purposes.</p><p>The <q>Washington Post</q> reported that an initially hesitant President Ford was assured by his advisers that Iran was only interested in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy despite the country’s enormous reserves of oil and natural gas. Ironically, Ford’s secretary of defense was Donald Rumsfeld, his chief of staff was Dick Cheney, and his head of nonproliferation efforts at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was Paul Wolfowitz, all of whom—as officials in the current administration—have insisted that Iran’s nuclear program must be assumed to have military applications.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Stephen Zunes, <a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/173" id="idm399">The U.S. and Iran: Democracy, Terrorism, and Nuclear Weapons</a>, Foreign Policy In Focus, July 26, 2005</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Rumsfeld, Cheney and others have questioned Iran’s need for a nuclear program, as Zune notes above.

This opinion has changed only because the Islamists have come into power, not because of the belief that Iran does not need energy diversification.</p></section><section><h3 id="USIndiaandIran">US, India, and Iran</h3><p>Adding India into this relationship shows further complications each country has in its foreign policy objectives, and self-interest.</p><p>India, one of the emerging countries, whom many think will be among the most powerful in a few decades, is already extremely thirsty for energy. It has long had ties with Iran in some form or another. India has one of the world’s largest Shia Muslim populations (Iran having the largest).</p><p>India also has potential natural gas deals with Iran worth billions of dollars. The US also sees India as an ally in their war on terror, and this was especially so when the previous government, the right wing Hindu party, the BJP, were in power. The US has long disapproved the Iran-India energy deal.</p><p>US leading Congressmen have warned India that it must choose between “the Iran of the Ayotollahs,” with its oil and gas, and the “democratic West,” with its advanced nuclear power technology. For now, India seems to have gone for the latter.</p><p>It may be that India has calculated that jeopardizing the multi-billion dollar natural gas deal with Iran will be worth it if the US helps with nuclear power stations instead. That would be understandable in the context of India’s rising nuclear status and its warming relations with the US on this matter.</p><p>Indeed, a number of globally interesting developments have taken place regarding Indian nuclear power. For example:</p><ul><li>US President George Bush described India as “a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology” thus admitting it to the “nuclear club.”</li><li>India has just recently decided to pursue non-proliferation rather than a global nuclear disarmament policy which it has long held.

In other words, it is a means to maintain an imbalance in power, consistent with the idea of being in a “nuclear club” and also the same position that the US has taken.)</li><li>This comes in the context of Indian attempts for permanent member status at the UN Security Council, which the US seems to be backing.</li><li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4379850.stm" title="External Link: 'Congress mulls India nuclear deal', October 27, 2005">The US is considering supporting India’s nuclear development</a>.</li></ul><p>For some further analysis on that angle, see for example the following</p><ul><li>From <q>Foreign Policy In Focus</q>:

A country of India’s size should have had the diplomatic elan to open a way for nuclear commerce with the US while at the same time standing up for a rational and dialog-based approach to the Iran nuclear issue. The two should not be mutually exclusive. India has a right to nuclear energy. And it has a right to have mutually beneficial relations with Iran, a country with which it shares deep cultural, civilizational and strategic interests. In energy terms, nuclear energy—even if the promised cooperation materializes—can only be an answer to India’s requirements in the long-term. For the short and medium term, India’s growth prospects depend more crucially on access to hydrocarbons from a mixed basket of sources, including Iran.

Unfortunately, in the world of realpolitik, each country looks out for its own interests. Why would Iran do this if it can’t get anything in return? Clearly, Iran wants to be recognized by the US, and is prepared to go a long way to do so. However, this also highlights that both the US and Iran might be hypocrites. They both claim moral high ground, yet, they both choose to turn away from peace if it suits their agendas.</p><figure class="pull-quote"><blockquote><p>Why didn’t the Bush administration embrace this [peace offer]?

To them, the country’s vast reserves of oil and natural gas make it a natural ally.

Together, they and four Central Asian countries—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan—have created the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security body that has emerged as a counterweight to U.S. influence in the region.</p><p>… Meanwhile, U.S. relations with both China and Russia are edging toward outright hostility. With Beijing, the administration has maintained cordial ties, in part because Big Business depends so heavily on China. But many Bush officials have an innate distrust, even loathing, of China, especially in the office of Vice President Cheney, who in 2001 drew several of his top aides from the staff of a strongly anti-China congressional committee pursuing allegations that Beijing had stolen state secrets during the Clinton administration.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Robert Dreyfuss, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/next_we_take_tehran.html">Next We Take Tehran</a>, Mother Jones Magazine, July/August 2006 issue</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Parallels to Iraq have not gone unnoticed, either.

However, policy analyst, Carah Ong, also notes that Pentagon officials have lamented that <a href="https://irannuclearwatch.blogspot.com/2006/09/pentagons-iran-directorate-us.html" title="External Link: Carah Ong, ‘Pentagon’s Iran Directorate: ‘US broadcasts into Iran aren’t tough enough’’, Iran Nuclear Watch, September 27, 2006">US broadcasts into Iran aren’t tough enough on the Iranian regime</a> and that their ideas are not working as planned because their broadcast outlets are not the main source of news for most Iranians.</p><p>Khatami has actually been pro-democracy but any reform attempts in such a country are naturally going to be very slow and difficult to achieve. An imposition of relatively quick massive changes will of course be met by resistance by those in power, and for a nation trying to be more democratic, it may unfortunately have to be a slow process so that it can get buy-in from those who fear of losing out. Of course the risk is that such attempts can be undermined as well, the longer it takes. It is not as simple as supporting democratic elements or very quickly ousting the existing regime because that may leave power vacuums that various groups may attempt to fill, as the Iraq experience has shown.</p><p>By funding opposition groups and calling for regime-change (while calling it “democracy-building”), the US makes such a task even harder, and risks actually undermining democracy because the ruling Islamic clerics will clearly see the opposition as lacking legitimacy, as policy analyst, Robert Naiman notes:</p><figure class="pull-quote"><blockquote><p>The notion of trying to undermine the Iranian government by funding opposition groups is both unethical and short-sighted. Groups and individuals who are known to receive such funding will be discredited politically in Iran. Indeed, prominent Iranian dissidents have rejected U.S. assistance, and have argued that the U.S. policy of confrontation hurts the democracy movement in Iran. Such activities by the U.S. appear to validate claims by Iranian government officials that their domestic critics are financed and inspired by foreigners.</p><p>In the context of modern Iranian history this is a powerful charge. In the 1950s a democratically elected government in Iran was overthrown by a military coup organized by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p><p>The democratic government was replaced by a repressive regime that the U.S. helped keep in power for the next 25 years.</p></blockquote><figcaption><cite>Robert Naiman, <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=67&amp;ItemID=11084">Iran House Votes to Undermine Talks with Iran—Will the Senate Follow?</a>, Just Foreign Policy/ZNet, September 30, 2006</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this certainly seems to have been the case, as hardliners in Iran have responded to US aggressive policy by getting rid of the reformist president, Khatami, in favor of the hardliner, Ahmadinejad.</p><p>As Naiman, also notes, US policies are restricting the ability for negotiations between Iran and US. “Officials in Iran will ask, why bother trying to negotiate with someone who has an official policy of trying to overthrow you?”</p></section><section><h3 id="ProDemocracyReformistKhatamilosesouttoHard-linerAhmadinejad">Pro Democracy Reformist, Khatami, loses out to Hard-liner, Ahmadinejad</h3><p>The previous leader of Iran, the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, showed precursory signs to the long march towards democracy. For his elections, he campaigned on democracy, the rule of law, and inclusion of all Iranians in the political decision-making process. When he first became president, he won elections by a landslide, showing the popularity within Iran for potential reforms.</p><p>This obviously rubbed many hard-line conservatives in Iran’s political and religious establishment the wrong way, and he was unable to implement many of his reform policies. Towards the end of his term in 2005, growing disillusionment contributed to his losing elections against the more conservative Ahmadinejad, backed by many of the more extreme ruling clergy.</p><p>Unfortunately, as noted earlier, US policies did not help either. The US pressure on Iran (from the nuclear stance, threats of war, war on terror stance, and more) have, perhaps unwittingly (though surely, to some extent, predictably?), helped emboldened hard-line elements further, and thus the nation has moved further away from democracy.</p></section><ins datetime="December 29, 2009"><section><h3 id="DeathofDissidentClericLeadstoClashesBetweenStateandOppositionSupporters">Death of Dissident Cleric Leads to Clashes Between State and Opposition Supporters</h3><p>On 19th December, 2009, an influential dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri, died.
