<h2>
ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS
</h2>

<p>
A&amp;E is a laser-printed monthly roleplaying game APA (amateur press
association), edited by 
<a href="leegold.html">Lee Gold</a>.
It has contributors from across the US, UK, and Canada.
It won Origins Awards in 1985, 2000, 2001, and 2002.
</p>

<p>
<b>
A&E is still coming out every month.
.
</b>
</p>

<p>
A&amp;E was begun back in 1975.
It skipped one month in the first year while Lee Gold was in Japan,
another month in 2006 when she was recovering from major surgery.
A&amp;E also skipped issues for Worldcon 73 (Spokane) and 76 (San Jose),
but has come out regularly every month otherwise.
This page will be changed or
deleted if A&amp;E stops being published.  Maximum length is 137 pages,
Maximum zine length is 14 pages.
</p>

<p>
A&amp;E is not affiliated with any gaming company.  Contributors are interested
in many different games.
They are also interested in cultural and military history, fantasy and
science fiction, rock music, military re-enactments, movies, martial arts,
murder mysteries, filksongs, science fiction fandom, religion, physics,
astronomy, and a number of other subjects, all of which can be easily tied
into roleplaying games if you take a sufficiently creative approach.
</p>

<p>
A snailmailed paper issue of A&amp;E costs $2.50 plus postage.
You may send cash, if you feel like trusting the Post Office with
it, but Lee isn't responsible if it goes astray.  Checks should
be made payable to Lee Gold.
</p>
<p>
If you vow not to send copies to other people, you may opt to receive
A&E as a PDF file: <i>$2 per issue</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to buy A&amp;E, please
contact Lee Gold:
<a href="mailto:lee.gold@ca.rr.com">lee.gold@ca.rr.com</a>, or
<a href="mailto:leeway@leegoldfilk.com">leeway@leegoldfilk.com</a>.
Do not write Barry, he is the webmaster, not the publisher.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Non-US buyers</strong> may send currency or a cheque in your own national
currency.
</p>
<p>
Payment may also be made by PayPal to Lee Gold's
account: <a href="mailto:lee.gold@ca.rr.com">lee.gold@ca.rr.com</a>.
(Your payment will be debited the PayPal fee, which is 3.49% plus
49&cent;, plus an additional 2.2% if your original currency is not US$.)

    <strong class="red">BACK ISSUES AVAILABLE:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    All back issues of A&amp;E are now available as PDFs.
    Issues 1 through 311
    images, scanned from paper copies and converted to PDF format,
    mostly between 10 and 25 megabytes.
    Issues from 312 to the present are available as PDFs generated from the
    word processing files. These are somewhat smaller, mostly between 7 and 10
    megabytes.
    Electronic editions are $2.00 per issue (no postage charge),
    sent by email or by web download.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, some Very Old A&amp;Es (#300 and earlier) are available on
    paper as originally published.
    People with US addresses may buy a dozen and have
them mailed in a Medium Flat Rate Priority box, the total
including postage is $1 per A&amp;E plus $17.10 postage for the box.
</p>
<div>
The current hard copies reside in two locations:
</div>
<div>
<ol class="close">
<li>
In cardboard boxes on a shelf on top of the cars in the garage.  (Note:
I am 4'9" tall.  I have to get on top of a ladder to reach these boxes.
I'm 75 years old.)  These magazines start around issue #100-#150 or so.  They're in mediocre shape.
</li>
<li>
In the front bedroom closet, piled on the floor and on shelves, starting around #150-#200 or so.  They're in better shape.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Don't count on any of these issues to be in complete runs until you get into the relatively recent years:  e.g. #300+.
</p>

<p>
No fixed cost subscriptions are possible, since postage and contribution
credit may vary from month to month.  Each month, your envelope will
indicate how much money you have left.   If there isn't enough money to
send A&amp;E, you will be notified &#8212; and your balance will be returned at your
request.
</p>

<p>
The cheapest way to get A&amp;E is to contribute.  A contributor pays per page
of the contribution and gets that issue free and the next issue for postage
only.  US contributors have A&amp;Es mailed First Class.  Non-US
contributors have A&amp;Es mailed Air Mail.  If you
have a contribution for A&amp;E,
email it to <a
href=mailto:leeway@leegoldfilk.com">leeway@leegoldfilk.com</a>
<b>and</b> to
<a href=mailto:lee.gold@ca.rr.com">lee.gold@ca.rr.com</a>.
The file may be be in .doc or .rtf format -- or in .pdf format.
If it's a pdf file, it should only be 7" wide.
If it's in .doc or .rtf format, Lee Gold will format and edit it.
This may involve correcting your spelling and grammar.
The cost is $1.75/page or fraction thereof.
</p>

<p> <strong>
Unpaid for material will not be printed nor included in A&amp;E.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you decide you want to revise a zine, PHONE (310) 306-7456
immediately.  If the original version has already been printed, you'll
be charged for materials used.
