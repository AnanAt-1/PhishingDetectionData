Allison with Shari Feldman, Miriam Ferziger, Dara Golden, Paul Woodard, and
Caren Pelletier.

Items marked '+' come from the Quantum Leap Drinking Game written by
Christine White with special thanks to Sally Smith for bringing it to
my attention.

This is a variation of a standard television show drinking game.  It is
recommended that you play this game either during a rerun or while watching
episodes on videotape and that you pre-select which situations you want to
look out for, otherwise you'll probably be wasted by the end of the first act.
Please feel free to distribute this list freely and to make any additions
you feel should be included.  Please send any additions or comments 
via Internet email to finifter@gandalf.rutgers.edu or through postal mail
to Tracy Finifter, 560 Gravelly Run, Mays Landing, NJ, 08330.  I'm really
interested in how this list will be circulated.
<P></P>

Disclaimer:  This list is intended to be fun.  Please, always drink in
moderation, know your limits, and never EVER drink and drive.
<P></P>


<HR>

Before you begin, once you know which episode you're watching, everybody
playing take a guess as to how many drinks will be scored (sips don't count).
The winner gets to take home the leftovers (if any) while the loser has to
clean up.
