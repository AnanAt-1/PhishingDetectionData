qualitative methods are makingheadway in French sociology. They
are the object of constant interestand their contents are much
discussed. Two outstanding figuresin French sociology, Pierre
Bourdieu and Alain Touraine, havegiven them pride of place in their
recent research. <BR><P>The aim of this paper is to examine the
methods thatthese authors have recently developed: the sociological
interventionand the provoked and accompanied self-analysis. A detailed
presentationis made of these methods and their respective strong and
weakpoints are then underlined. The latter are approached in sucha
way as to open a broad discussion on the problems faced by sociology
such, for instance, as the status of common sense in relationto the
sociological explanation. The lessons learned from thesemethods permit,
in conclusion, the formulation of propositionsfor which, however,
the author of this paper is alone responsible.<BR><P><B>Brief
introduction<BR></B><P>Touraine's use of qualitative methods is
not recent,however, since his first surveys on worker consciousness
(Touraine,1966) were already recommending the semi-directed sociological
interview. But it was in his book <I>La voix et le regard </I>that
he first proposed employing the sociological intervention method,by
which he hoped to renew sociological methodology. This methodhas had
a considerable impact on French-language sociology andhas given rise
to numerous studies on women, students, environmentalistsand the labour
movement in France (Touraine, 1978; 1983b; 1987).This group of studies -
carried out on the initiative of Tourainehimself, with a team joined by
well-known French sociologistsof the day such as Michel Wieviorka and
Fran&ccedil;ois Dubet- is referred to as <I>permanent sociology</I>,
in other wordsa sociology constantly at work and directly involved in
politicaland social action. The sociological study of social movements
in Qu&eacute;bec has also made considerable use of the sociological
intervention method (Gagnon, 1982; Maheu, 1988).<BR><P>In Bourdieu's
work, qualitative methods appear inhis first studies of an ethnological
nature (Bourdieu, 1977).His subsequent sociological studies, such as
his studies on education,museum attendance and the French university
(Bourdieu, 1969, 1977,1979, 1990) were essentially designed according
to the most advancedquantitative methods. However, in his most recent
study, <I>Lamis&egrave;re du monde</I> (1993), Bourdieu applies a new
qualitativemethod, &quot;provoked and accompanied self-analysis,&quot;
thusdeclaring his liberation from positivism (Bourdieu, 1994). Indeed,
this method marks a real turning point for this author in relation
to his former positions on representativeness and objectivityin
sociology, as well as on the status attributed to common senseand to the
epistemological rupture.<BR><P><B>Alain Touraine and the sociological
interventionmethod<BR></B><P>The first to appear in French sociology,
the sociologicalintervention is described by its author &quot;as an
intensiveand in-depth process during which sociologists lead the actors
from a struggle they must carry on themselves to an analysis oftheir
own action. This process involves a series of stages thatconstitute the
history of the research&quot; (Touraine, Dubet&amp; Wieviorka, 1982:
280). The sociological intervention isthus a <I>self-analysis</I> that
requires the active participationof social actors engaged in a collective
struggle concerning politicaland social issues. The struggle of women,
students, ecologists,workers, Solidarnosc in Poland are all entitled
to claim thistitle and the goal of the sociologists' intervention
in thesestruggles is to turn them into a social movement. According
toTouraine, such a movement is &quot;the effort of a collective
actor to take over the &quot;values&quot;, cultural orientationsof
a society by opposing the action of an adversary to whom heis linked
by relationships of power&quot; (Touraine, 1995: 239).<BR><P>Thus,
the sociological intervention concerns a militantaction and aims to
carry out a sociological analysis of that actionin cooperation with its
principal actors. Emphasis is placed on&quot;the search for issues, the
analysis of the contradictionsof action and distance between a struggle,
a discourse and a movementof opinion&quot; (Touraine, 1978: 66) likely
to galvanize a struggleand transform it into a social movement. But
the sociologicalintervention does not merely focus on the analysis of
a politicaldiscourse and a militant organization: it is also concerned
withthe struggle represented by the action that has brought these
about.<BR><P>By definition, this method requires the participationof
the actors in this struggle, at least its key figures, whoare invited
to a series of meetings that may take place over awhole year. At these
meetings they will be confronted by a teamof sometimes as many as seven
sociologists. Two of these assumethe leading roles of <I>secretary</I>
and <I>moderator</I>. Thelatter is the person who will chair the meetings
- he introducesthe participants, guides the discussion, gives people the
floor,etc. - while the former is responsible for noting the different
opinions expressed during the discussions and proposing a sociological
interpretation of them. If these roles are beyond their capabilities,
other members of the team take over.<BR><P>During the meetings
and discussions, the participantsare invited to trace the history of
their struggle, the variousincidents that have marked their collective
action. When mutualtrust is established and the actors realize the need
for an analysis,they are then confronted with interlocutors who either
opposeor support their action. Antinuclear activists, for instance,are
confronted by EDF (&#133;lectricit&eacute; de France) administrators
who manage the nuclear power plants. These interlocutors expressa
viewpoint that is opposed to that of the militants but together,they
offer an overall view of the nuclear question in France.Actors such as
these are thus brought into the group in orderto highlight the militant
action, grasp its ins and outs and neutralizethe ideological pressures
and political gambits that are inevitablyinvolved in, or caused by,
a collective struggle of this nature.<BR><P>Both sides are then
inclined to see their struggleas part and parcel of a social movement,
the theory of socialmovements disposing them to recognize its sense
in their own action.By interpreting the actors' comments in the light
of this theory,an hypothesis emerges that explains their collective
action ina sense in which that action can conclusively indicate a social
movement. If it is recognized and accepted by both parties, thesense
revealed by this self-analysis can then bolster their actionand help
it attain &quot;the highest level it can reach&quot;(Touraine, 1981b:
213).<BR><P>This final phase is termed <I>conversion </I>of thegroup
and on it depends the success of the sociological intervention.Indeed,
if the sense is endorsed by the actors of the struggleinvited to the
discussions, this means that the sociological theorywhich brought it to
light is validated as to its pertinence inexplaining the action that
is the object of the sociological intervention.This verification is
therefore done on the spot with the agreementof the actors who, through
their participation in the sociologicalintervention, are able to measure
its explanatory value.<BR><P>The sociological intervention thus proves
to be apermanent sociology since the explanation of the social actionit
helps to reveal is established in the heat of an open discussionwith its
own actors. The latter may benefit from this to directtheir collective
action so as to turn it into a social movement.The sociological theory
is thus ready to feed its object of study:the social action originally
envisaged by the sociological intervention.Alain Touraine's method
takes note of the special status of thesociological explanation
emphasized by Anthony Giddens whose theoreticalapproach is in
many ways closely related to that of the authorof the sociological
intervention. &quot;Theories in sociology,said Giddens, have to be
some part based upon ideas wich (althoughnot necessarily discursively
formulated by them) are alreay heldby the agents to whom they refer. Once
reincorporated within action,their original quality may be lost;
they may have become too familiar&quot;(Giddens, 1984: XXXIV).<BR>
<P>Sociology supplies an explanation capable of accountingfor
the social action while at the same time helping to directit when
its actors reflect the need. The sociological interventionaims to
provide the methodological details of this return to theaction to which
Giddens merely gives his blessing.<BR><P><B>Some technical details
concerning the sociologicalintervention<BR></B><P>After this rapid
overview, we shall now take a brieflook at the technical details of this
method. The first objectiveis to gain the active participation of the
social actors because,according to Touraine, they have a <I>practical
consciousness</I>respecting their action. This consciousness is seen,
moreover,as &quot;real knowledge of the social action&quot; (Dubet, 1988:
13). The positive status attributed to practical consciousnessstems
from a position whereby the &quot;sociologists' actor isan epistemic
actor insofar as his remarks fit into a form of knowledgethat makes him
knowable&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.: 2), and makes hisaction knowable, too. In
other words, social action is graspedonly through this consciousness
- practical in form since it stemsfrom the immediate experience that
its actors have of the action.Moreover, sociological methodology is
obliged to take accountof this practical consciousness that emerges
from the actors'&quot;remarks&quot; since these are in fact &quot;the
only materialavailable&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.: 13). Indeed, the material
at thedisposal of sociology for grasping its object always remains
theremarks of actors imbued in the final analysis with the practical
consciousness of social action.<BR><P>Although this consciousness
remains the intermediaryof the action, its highest sense is nonetheless
revealed by sociologicaltheory &quot;because the actor has only a limited
consciousnessof the sense of his action&quot; for &quot;the dimensions
of thesocial system or the conditions of the action (...) escape the
consciousness of the social actors&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.: 17). Toremedy
this, the sociological intervention, at the methodologicallevel, proposes
that the social actors meet as a group thus offering&quot;the image
of the social movement, with its many meaningsand its more or less
stable configurations&quot; (Wieviorka, 1986:160).<BR><P><I><B>On
representativeness<BR></B></I><P>The actors who participate in the
sociological interventionare chosen with this in view. Their choice is
determined by thedesire to reconstitute the collective struggle on a
reduced scale,that of the group, &quot;constructed on the basis of as
completeand diversified a theoretical representation of the struggle
aspossible&quot; or again, &quot;of an image that the sociologists
make of it&quot; (<I>Idem</I>).<BR><P>This &quot;image&quot;
explores in minutest detailthe theory of social movements whereby any
collective struggleis bound to change into a social movement. This
shift from theindustrial to the post-industrial society must conflict
with atechnocratic power and thus acknowledge the democratic ideal
(Touraine,1994). Participants in the sociological intervention must
thereforepossess the <I>quality</I> of being actors in a struggle
characterizedin this way and of which each in his own way represents
a differentconfiguration. The group's representativeness depends less
onthe quantity of participants than on the quality conferred onthem
by the <I>theory</I> of social movements.<P>The real interest of the
sociological interventionlies in this sole aspect. Indeed, it maintains
convincingly thata collective struggle can, from a methodological
point of view,be reduced to a group whose participants possess the
theoreticalqualities necessary for its analysis. Nonetheless, this
methodposes certain problems in this regard. By focusing on the militant
quality of the participants, as figureheads, their representativeness
in the sociological intervention tends to be limited to a political
level. From a broader perspective, these participants may be considered
as representative elements of a social struggle since they seemto be
its leaders or because the media, for instance, presentsthem as such. In
our view, the definition of representativenessin this sense presents
serious problems that may even discreditthe sociological intervention
method. Nonetheless, the idea ofa method that can reduce a struggle or,
more generally, a socialfact to the size of a group - whose theoretical
representativenesssuggests it to be an excellent observation point -
must be conservedand studied in greater depth.<BR><P>The sociological
intervention has a further qualityin that it recognizes the value of the
social actors' practicalconsciousness, yet the importance attributed to
this practicalconsciousness seems paradoxical. Although it is seen from
theoutset as &quot;true consciousness,&quot; or even &quot;the only
real consciousness available,&quot; yet it is nonetheless considered
as &quot;limited&quot; consciousness because &quot;the dimensions
of the social system and the conditions of the action&quot; escape
it, the actors thus having only a limited consciousness of them.This
latter term is used confusedly and should probably not beaccorded so
much weight. In our view, it should be understoodin a more qualified
way.<BR><P>If the dimensions of the social system escape theactors'
consciousness, it is not because that consciousness islimited. On the
contrary, it may be argued that the actors' practicalconsciousness is not
only constituted by the &quot;dimensionsof the social system&quot; but
also by the addition of the wholerange of dimensions that characterize
the action - historical,psychological, social, etc. All of these
constitute the objectof this practical consciousness which is therefore
by no meanslimited. It is sociology that, by definition, must try to
&quot;limit&quot;or reduce it by highlighting the &quot;dimensions of
the socialsystem and the conditions of the action&quot; that must be
drawnfrom the practical consciousness that the social actors possessof
their own action, this being the very object of sociology.<BR><P>For
this purpose, the sociological intervention proposesa somewhat daring
self-analytical approach. Together with sociologistswho guide them in
this direction, the social actors are urgedto reveal the sense of their
collective action and, through thisself-analysis, to take account of
its social dimensions, goingbeyond its practical consciousness. The
sociological interventionmethod is somewhat vague on this point,
however, and indeed amountsto an interpretative approach of which
psychoanalysis is the perfectmodel. By acting as an interpreter, the
secretary of the sociologists'team identifies the social dimensions of
the action by interpretingits actors' remarks in the light of social
movements theory whichdisposes the actors to reveal these dimensions
and to assume apractical consciousness of them. The secretary proposes
them inthe form of an hypothesis with which he challenges the group
ofactors. If this hypothesis achieves their conversion, it servesas
a sociological explanation that can possibly provide theiraction with
the coefficient it lacks to become a social movement.<BR><P>While,
contrary to the criticism levelled at it (Amiot,1982), the social
intervention hardly resembles a &quot;<I>psychanalysesauvage</I>&quot;,
it must be admitted that this phase of theintervention is lacking in
explicit methodological proceduresand rules, the focus being placed
on <I>conversion</I>. Thus,the sociological intervention, or rather
the sociologists' intervention,seems to fade away under cover of this
conversion. The consequentinterpretation then becomes suspect since its
value depends lesson the rigour of the rules and procedures employed
than on thedegree of support given to the resulting hypothesis by
the group.The conversion to the hypothesis may well be caused by the
friendlyfeelings inspired in the group by the sociologists or, on the
contrary, by the group's desire to put an end to the discussionand
to take their leave.<BR><P>For lack of precise indications in this
respect,the interpretation may be, or appear to be, a repetition of the
actors' <I>militant discourse</I> expressed in other terms - inthis
case sociological, the sociological intervention having constitutedjust
another tribune for them. In less drastic terms, it can bethe simplified
picture of the social action formed by the practicalconsciousness of
its actors for whom this intervention highlightsthe general dimensions
that act as social dimensions since thelatter escape their practical
consciousness by definition. Conversely,the interpretation may weaken
the actors' practical consciousnessin favour of social movements theory
by means of which the sociologicalintervention will have caused the
conversion. From this viewpoint,the sociological intervention method
raises problems that it cannotsolve.<BR><P><B>Pierre Bourdieu
and provoked and accompanied self-analysis<BR></B><P>Without this
rapprochement suggesting any theoreticalrelationship, Alain Touraine's
sociological intervention can becompared with the &quot;provoked and
accompanied self-analysis&quot;recently proposed by Pierre Bourdieu in
order to study the differentaspects of suffering in the world (Bourdieu
<I>et al</I>., 1993).Like the sociological interview whose methodological
qualitiesare recalled and described by Bourdieu, provoked and accompanied
self-analysis evokes the direct participation of social actorsas does,
moreover, the sociological intervention. The sociologicalinterview is
termed &quot;provoked&quot; because in all casesit takes place when
requested or &quot;provoked&quot; by sociologistsin order to pursue
the object of their study. It is an &quot;accompanied&quot;interview
because, according to Bourdieu, the interviewer mustaccompany the
interviewee, according to the sense conveyed byhis remarks.<BR><P>
Bourdieu considers that this sense may be graspedby the interviewer,
in this case the sociologist, if the lattermanages to objectivize the
dispositions and social positions thatthis sense expresses concerning
the objective relationships betweenthe various sorts of capital by which
social fields are formed.It is in this way that the <I>participant
objectivization</I>that Bourdieu talks about can be understood. The
provoked andaccompanied self-analysis constitutes its ideal method
since it&quot;enables us to really construct the space of objective
relationships(structure) of which the directly observed communicational
exchanges(interaction) are the manifestation&quot; (Bourdieu &amp;
Wacquant,1992: 227). Indeed, if the interviewee's dispositions
and socialpositions are reflected in those of the interviewer, the
lattercan easily recognize them. As a sociologist familiar with the
theory explaining the configuration of capital and social space,he
succeeds in objectivizing them under ideal conditions. Thesociological
interview, henceforth seen as provoked and accompaniedself-analysis, fits
this purpose perfectly.<BR><P><I><B>On epistemological rupture<BR>
</B></I><P>In Bourdieu's work, this &quot;method&quot; stemsfrom a
new trend announced in his <I>R&eacute;ponses</I> to Lo&Ocirc;cWacquant,
namely &quot;to go into the street and question thefirst-comer&quot;
(Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992: 176). This methodis in direct contrast
with the quantitative orientation of hisprevious studies in which it is
argued that &quot;the first comer&quot;can in no way be considered as
a perfect sample for revealingthe configuration of capital and social
space on which the sociologicalexplanation must necessarily focus. This
configuration of capitaland social space could not be drawn from the
&quot;first comer's&quot;remarks without causing an epistemological
rupture formerly heldas &quot;the sovereign principle of a unequivocal
distinctionbetween the false and the true&quot; (Bourdieu <I>et
al</I>.,1991: 29) introduced by the theory in situating these remarks
at the level of objective relationships. The epistemological rupture
was thus marked by an opposition to the actors' practical consciousness
which is conveyed by <I>common sense</I>, seen by Bourdieu asfalse
consciousness.<P>The author's recent positions on the subject recall
that sociology certainly demands an epistemological rupture asregards
common sense whose definition, however, is nuanced. &quot;Rigorous
knowledge,&quot; states Bourdieu, &quot;almost always assumesa
more or less resounding rupture with the evidence of commonsense,
commonly identified with good sense. It is only at thecost of an active
denunciation of the tacit presumptions of commonsense that the effects
of all the representations of social realityto which investigators and
their subjects are continually exposedcan be countered.&quot; And he goes
on, &quot;Social agents donot have &quot;innate knowledge&quot; of what
they are and whatthey do; more precisely, they do not necessarily have
access tothe reason for their discontent or their distress and the most
spontaneous declarations can, with no intention of dissimulation,express
something quite different from what they are apparentlysaying&quot;
(<I>Ibid</I>.: 918-191).<BR><P>Common sense is &quot;denounced,&quot;
not becauseit shows itself to be false by definition, but because it
stemsfrom a &quot;spontaneous&quot; consciousness of the social actors,
directly related to their action and therefore unable to giveaccess
to the &quot;principle&quot; that can explain their suffering.Thus, the
social actors do not have &quot;innate knowledge&quot;of their action,
in the sense that they cannot explain it by thisprinciple expressly
sought by sociological theory, so that thepractical consciousness of
social actors conceals &quot;no intentionof dissimulation.&quot;<BR>
<P>Based on his interviews with the social actors invitedto talk about
suffering, Bourdieu notes that, on the contrary&quot;the interviewees,
especially among the most destitute, seemto grasp this situation (the
sociological interview) as an exceptionalopportunity offered to them
to testify ... to explain themselves,in the fullest sense of the term,
namely to construct their viewpointon themselves and on the world and
to identify the point, withinthis world, from which they see themselves
and see the world,and become comprehensible, justified, and primarily
for themselves&quot;(<I>Ibid</I>.: 915). If sociological theory must
oppose this,it is because this practical consciousness is marked by
&quot;routinesof the ordinary thought of the social world which is more
attachedto substantial &quot;realities,&quot; individuals, groups,
etc.,than to objective relationships that cannot be shown or touched
and that must be conquered, constructed and validated by scientific
work&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.: 918-919), namely by sociological theory.<BR>
<P>Without referring to it directly, Bourdieu's positionechoes that
of Anthony Giddens for whom &quot;any social agenthas a high degree
of knowledge which he invokes in the productionand reproduction of
daily social practices, but the greater partof this knowledge is
practical rather than theoretical&quot; (Giddens,1984: 22). Social
agents thus demonstrate a <I>knowledge </I>thatthey exploit to explain
their practice to themselves without itdeveloping into a theory such as
sociological theory. This knowledgeis practical, &quot;[it] is all that
the agents know tacitly,all that they know how to do in social life
without necessarilybeing able to express it directly in a discursive
manner&quot;(<I>Ibid</I>.: XXIII). In this line of thought, Giddens
goes so far as to statethat this knowledge is practical because the
agents are unableto express it <I>verbally</I>. <BR><P>In comparison,
Bourdieu's position is, in our view,far more fruitful and subtle. He
holds that this knowledge isroutine since it is directly related to
practice. It is the practicalknowledge of the practice because this
knowledge bears the stampof routine as long as the practice is shown
conclusively to bethe doings of &quot;individuals, groups, substantial
realities.&quot;In this line of thought, differences appear as to the
definitionthat Bourdieu gives to the epistemological rupture. Indeed,
thesense commonly conveyed by the social actors' remarks is henceforth
no longer considered as false consciousness but as <I>routines
</I>of knowledge that tend to translate social action as the doings
of individuals or groups rather than to situate it at the levelof
&quot;objective relationships&quot; constituting the very objectof
sociological theory. Only research initiated by this theoryallows the
&quot;conquering&quot; or &quot;constructing&quot;of the social action
at the level of objective relationships sincethat is its goal.<BR>
<P><I>La mis<I>&egrave;re du monde </I></I>presentsthis work <I>in
action</I> and, without any intention of beingso, it can be seen as
a daring experiment in qualitative methodologyin sociology. Indeed,
each chapter comprises an interview thattestifies to a specific aspect
of suffering. Each of them includes:a) detailed notes on the context
and conduct of the interview,b) its transcription in full and c) the
sociological interpretationresulting from each testimony. The latter
should not be consideredas a sociological explanation, notes Bourdieu,
who hastens toemphasize that &quot;the testimonies given us by men and
womenconcerning their lives and their existential difficulties havebeen
organized so as to obtain ... as comprehensive a view asthe requirements
of the scientific method impose on us, and permitus to accord them&quot;
(Bourdieu <I>et al</I>., 1993: 7). Inother words, by their testimony,
the social actors' contributionto the definition of sociological theory
must not overlook theexacting demands of sociological research.<BR><P>
Bourdieu's study is daring insofar as the work ispresented in such a
way that anyone can understand it. Each interviewis organized according
to its transcription and notes on its conductwhich shed light on the
resulting sociological interpretation.The &quot;organization&quot; of
the interviews in this form isdesigned to show the transformation of
the actors' viewpoint intoan explanation or theory that demonstrates
the sociological viewpoint:showing social action at the level of
objective relationships.In Bourdieu's particularly inspired words, it
gives rise to a&quot;democratization of the hermeneutic posture&quot;
(Bourdieu<I>et al</I>., 1993: 923), in that the sociological work -
inthis case the interpretation - can be grasped immediately.<BR><P>
<I><B>On representativeness<BR></B></I><P>Each testimony is seen
as the ideal &quot;case&quot;of a specific apect of suffering and
their representativenessemerges in their order of presentation. This
is structured soas to ensure the representativeness of each of the
aspects ofsuffering studied. &quot;Thus, the order in which the cases
arearranged is intended to bring together, during the time of reading,
people with different - and possibly conflicting - viewpoints;it also
reveals the representativeness of the case directly analyzed... by
grouping cases around it that can be considered variantsof it&quot;
(<I>Ibid</I>.: 8). The cases are thus arranged inorder to reconstitute
the mosaic of suffering according to anorder that is nothing more nor
less than the sociologist's own&quot;image&quot; of suffering, to repeat
the term used to definethe representativeness of the group of social
actors invited toparticipate in the sociological intervention. The
representativenessof each of the interviews is based on an image or
&quot;theory&quot;designed to attain the goal Bourdieu attributes
to sociology,namely that of considering suffering at the level of
objectiverelationships. The order of presentation of each interview
and,consequently of each testimony of a particular aspect of suffering,
constitutes the demonstration of this &quot;theory.&quot; Thesecases are
representative insofar as they each form an ideal observationpoint for
understanding a specific aspect of suffering, this idealcharacter being
reinforced by the place occupied in the overallorder of presentation.<BR>
<P>As regards this &quot;image&quot; or &quot;theory&quot;,each of the
social actors chosen in the context of the study represents,in Bourdieu's
view, a particular aspect of suffering. This representativenessis not
based on the statistical data to which it is often reducedin sociology
but is a representativeness that may be termed <I>theoretical</I>or
<I>sociological</I>. It is a representativeness based on thequalities
of the testimonies of individuals considered by Bourdieuas agents of
dispositions and social positions by which sufferingcan be studied
from a sociological point of view.<BR><P>The social actors who
take part in the sociologicalstudy will, according to their degree
of representativeness, giveaccess to the &quot;principle&quot; that,
in Bourdieu's view,can explain suffering. For this purpose, their
individual characteristicsare set aside in favour of the characteristics
that permit theestablishment of this explanation which Bourdieu sees as
theirdispositions and positions in a social space. This goal may even
be attained by means of a <I>single</I> person possessing thenecessary
qualities. Bourdieu himself notes on this point that&quot;contrary to
what a naively personalized view of the singularityof social persons
might suggest, it is the identifying of thestructures underlying the
conjunctural remarks made in a specificinteraction that can alone enable
us to grasp the essentials ofwhat constitutes the idiosyncrasy of each
(of the social actors)and all the singular complexity of their actions
and reactions&quot;(<I>Ibid.</I>: 916).<BR><P>Pursuing this line of
thought, Bourdieu will allowhimself a comparison between the qualitative
methodology thathe proposes in sociology with the &quot;provoked and
accompaniedself-analysis&quot; and the experimental method in the
exact sciences.In his dialogue with Lo&iuml;c Wacquant, he aptly
points outthat &quot;Galileo did not need to repeat his inclined
plane experimentindefinitely in order to construct the model for the
law of fallingbodies. A single, well-constructed case ceases to be
particular&quot;(Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992: 57). It now remains
to be seenhow his method succeeds in &quot;well constructing&quot;
a caseso that it may lead to a sociological explanation.<BR><P>
<B>Some problems with the provoked and accompaniedself-analysis
method<BR></B><P>The first problem with the method arises from the
qualities attributed to it. The latter are essentially theoretical-
conferred by virtue of the &quot;theory&quot; whereby the individual
is marked by a methodological value to explain suffering. Thisis not
sufficiently explained by Bourdieu. In his work, thesequalities come from
a &quot;familiarity&quot; felt upon contactwith the interviewees - the
social actors who are the privilegedwitnesses to the various aspects of
suffering. This familiarityis linked to the fact that these individuals
were immediatelyseen as &quot;people of knowledge or people to whom
(the sociologists)could be introduced by people of knowledge&quot;
(<I>Ibid</I>.:908). If this familiarity can turn the interview into
an idealcommunication situation, on which Bourdieu rightly insists,
itis nonetheless suggested that it was established &quot;with the
first-comer.&quot;<BR><P>It is also connected to the dispositions and
socialpositions that interact, at different levels, between interviewee
and interviewer. Indeed, since the latter can immediately recognize
them in the former, he can therefore bring them to light in orderto
explain the suffering that the interviewee is experiencingas regards the
configuration of capital and social space. Familiarity,from this second
point of view, is thus &quot;based on prior knowledgeof the realities
that the research may reveal&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.:916). However, this
prior knowledge, like Touraine's image ofa struggle, may well place
the interviewees' value at a politicallevel since both interviewee
and interviewer share the same dispositionsand social positions.<BR>
<P>In our view, it would be better if this familiaritywere related
to the theoretical representation of suffering heldby the interviewer
the particular aspect of which will be revealedby the case study at the
level of dispositions and social positions.This representation must obey
the constraints involved in thework of &quot;well constructing&quot; a
case, as Bourdieu so aptlyputs it. In other words, it must explore the
methodological imaginationby which the case in question may be seen as
an ideal observationpoint for explaining suffering, by highlighting,
for instance,the objective relationships through which, according
to Bourdieu,the object of sociology may be recognized.<BR><P>The
problem, in Bourdieu's work, is that this methodologicalfamiliarity
is not clearly established in the form of methodologicalrules and
principles. It can be summarized as the &quot;democratizationof the
hermeneutic posture&quot; expressed by the &quot;organization&quot;
of each testimony of suffering. While this democratization allowsthe
realization of the hermeneutic posture, no explicit methodological
indications are given. Consequently, the value of the sociological
interpretation depends less on the rigour of the process thanon the
'attraction' of this interpretation aroused by its rapprochementwith the
transcript of the interview, and which may well elicitadherence or even
<I>conversion</I>, to echo the sociologicalintervention method. Under
these conditions, it is far from certainthat this interpretation is a
&quot;well-constructed&quot; sociologicalexplanation: only a detailed
statement of the rules and proceduresthat make it possible might
prove this. Bourdieu has a word tosay on this point, however, in his
methodological note at theend of <I>La mis&egrave;re du monde</I>.<BR>
<P>Indeed, the author suggests that &quot;despite theold diltheyan
distinction, it must be stated that understandingand explaining are
but one and the same thing&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.:910). The explanation
is therefore related to the interpretationof the practical knowledge
that the social actors have of theirown action. In the same line of
thought, Bourdieu rightly recallsthat the sociological explanation
is a point of view and that&quot;the sociologist cannot ignore the
fact that the basis ofhis point of view is to be a point of view on
a point of view&quot;(<I>Ibid</I>.: 925), that of the social actors,
or, in other words,&quot;knowledge of knowledge&quot; (Bourdieu &amp;
Wacquant, 1992:103).<BR><P>This viewpoint of the social actors must
thereforebe considered as the positive status of knowledge of which the
object is their action in all its dimensions - individual, psychological,
historical, etc. The sociologists' point of view, however, isanother
sort of knowledge that tries to deduce from the actors'knowledge the
&quot;objective relationships&quot; by which Bourdieurepresents the
social dimension of their action. It is thereforepresented as knowledge
enabling this dimension of the action tobe abstracted from the social
actors' knowledge which is its practicalform and to transform it into an
abstract form better suited totheory.<BR><P>If the sociological point
of view is &quot;a pointof view on a point of view,&quot; as Bourdieu
puts it, then theshift or transformation of the social actors' point of
view tothe sociological point of view must be explained. In brief, this
shift constitutes the sociologists' ideal intervention as regardstheir
work on the social actors' knowledge in order to achievesociological
knowledge or explanation. More precisely, the interpretationmay be
compared here to the course followed in order to revealthe object of
sociology: the &quot;objective relationships&quot;or &quot;dimensions
of the social system&quot; based on the socialactors' knowledge whose
object is the action in all its dimensions.<BR><P>With Bourdieu, the
sociological interpretation isbased on an understanding of this knowledge
of common sense thathe terms <I>generic</I> and <I>genetic</I>. It
obeys the firstterm insofar as, by its function, the dispositions and
positionsto which all individuals testify at their own level are placed
in the light of the &quot;objective relationships&quot; by which,on a
broader scale, they are generated independently of theirknowledge. On
the other hand, it is by exploring them that sociologicalknowledge
is formed. In other words, it is through the understandingof this
knowledge that the theory expressed by revelation of theobjective
relationships is formulated. In this sense, this understandingcan be
described as genetic.<BR><P>The technical problem, as in Touraine's
work, arisesfrom the <I>absence of precise indications</I> concerning
therules that govern the hermeneutics by which the &quot;objective
relationships&quot; between the dispositions and social positionsemerge
from the sociological interview seen, however, as a &quot;provokedand
accompanied self-analysis.&quot; It is up to the reader toimagine them
by examining the &quot;evidence&quot; - the contextof the interview,
its complete transcript and the resulting sociologicalinterpretation. In
other words, these rules are revealed throughthis democratization of the
hermeneutic posture.<BR><P><I><B>On sociological writing<BR></B></I>
<P>Criticisms, on this point, have been severe. Thelatest to date
notes that &quot;deprived of the 'immense knowledge'of Pierre Bourdieu
and his team, this sociology of suffering maywell merely reflect the
suffering of sociology&quot; (Mayer, 1995:369).<BR><P>But Bourdieu
has, to a certain extent, forestalledthis criticism by emphasizing that
the hermeneutic posture thathe proposes is immediately revealed by the
<I>writing </I>of theinterpretation. Indeed, the writing testifies to
this hermeneutics,more broadly to the rules by which the testimonies
collected areobjectivized by being transposed to the level of the
theory whichis then expressed in its own specific vocabulary. The
writingis its mainspring; it is the means to reach the objectivizing
viewpoint which abstracts from the practical viewpoint of thesocial
agents the dispositions and social positions revealed bythe research
that produces the sociological knowledge by whichsuffering is explained
theoretically, in this case, the configurationof types of social capital
and fields. He states very pertinentlythat:<BR><P>(the sociologist)
can only hope to make his mostinevitable interventions acceptable at
the cost of the writingwork that is essential to conciliate doubly
contradictory objectives:to reveal all the elements necessary for
the objective analysisof the position of the person questioned and
for the understandingof his attitudes, without establishing with
him the objectivizingdistance that would reduce him to the state of
entomological curiosity;to adopt a viewpoint as close as possible to
his without, however,projecting oneself unduly into this <I>alter
ego</I> who alwaysremains, whether one likes it or not, an object,
in order to makeoneself abusively the subject of the latter's world
view. (Bourdieu,1993: 8)<BR><P>The enterprise of participant
objectivization, inthe way Bourdieu intends it, is thus expressed
in the writingwhich distinguishes between the &quot;analysis&quot;
elicitedfrom the interviewee and that of the sociologist, in this case
Bourdieu, obliged to elucidate the dispositions and social positions
linked by objective relationships that escape the former's practical
knowledge. It is through the writing that sociological knowledgecan
be revealed, even differentiated, from practical knowledge.The writing
is thus marked by the epistemological chiasmus whichmakes sociological
knowledge possible. Its task is to testifyto the hermeneutics by which
sociological knowledge is constitutedin Bourdieu's work.<BR><P>Yet,
strangely, Bourdieu hastens to add that thesociologist &quot;will never
have succeeded so well in his participantobjectivization enterprise
unless he manages to give the appearancesof the obvious and the natural,
even naive submission to the data,to constructions completely inhabited
by his critical reflection&quot;(<I>Idem</I>.). In other words, although
having to subscribe tothe participant objectivization that characterizes
his task, thesociologist, states Bourdieu, must nonetheless strive
to erase,through his writing, any trace liable to indicate the factors
that govern the hermeneutics underlying sociological knowledge.<BR><P>
Thereafter, he cannot prevent himself from insistingon the fact that to
prove its explanatory value, the writing ofthe sociological knowledge
must be based on the content of thetestimonies that constitute the
interviews. This context permits&quot;the delivery of a more accessible
equivalent of complexand abstract conceptual analyses ... Capable of
touching and moving,of appealing to sensibility, without pandering to
sensationalism,it can bring about conversions of thought and view that
are oftenthe prior condition to understanding&quot; (<I>Ibid</I>.:
922).In stating this, Bourdieu seems curiously to subscribe to the
impostures that he denounces in the <I>thick description</I> ofClifford
Geertz (1973, 1988) and, thereafter, in the post modernisttheses in
anthropology whereby the latter is no more than a <I>text</I>whose
rhetorical qualities reflect the explanatory value of theanthropological
theories. Indeed, he suggests that the abilityto move, &quot;to speak
to the sensibility&quot; produced by thetranscription of the interviews
gives body to the rules that establishthe hermeneutic posture arising
from the writing. In our view,their absence constitutes a problem that
the writing alone cannotsolve in spite of its ability to &quot;speak
to the sensibility&quot;aroused by the qualities it possesses. Due to
a lack of explicitlyformulated rules, the hermeneutic posture vaunted
by Bourdieuonly amounts to &quot;the writing talent that Clifford
Geertzgives as a model to young American researchers, through the
praiseof what he calls &quot;<I>thick description</I>&quot; and the
exaltation of particularity and &quot;<I>local knowledge</I>&quot;
(Bourdieu, 1988: 11).<BR><P><B>Conclusion</B><P><B>The advances
of qualitative methodology in fivepoints<BR></B><P>In spite of
their limits, the methods of Pierre Bourdieuand Alain Touraine enable
various lessons to be drawn, thus markingadvances in the development of
qualitative methods. These mustbe emphasized as the conclusion of this
article.<BR><P><I>First</I>, sociology has alwaysdealt with social
actors endowed with practical consciousness.Following Bourdieu's and
Touraine's propositions and in spiteof their vague formulation, this
practical consciousness can beseen as a type of <I>knowledge</I>. This
knowledge assumes a practicalform, in the sense that it is immediately
connected to the actionand reflects all its dimensions - political,
historical, psychological,etc. - as well as the &quot;dimensions of the
social system.&quot;Consequently, it represents the essential vector for
bringingthem to light.<BR><P><I>Second</I>, sociology thusreveals
itself as &quot;knowledge of knowledge&quot;, as Bourdieuputs it. It is
obliged to draw on practical knowledge in orderto explain the factors
that define the object of its study: the&quot;dimensions of the social
system,&quot; according to Touraine,or the objective relationships
between dispositions and socialpositions, according to Bourdieu.<BR>
<P><I>Third, </I>sociological knowledgerequires work that Bourdieu
terms <I>participant</I> objectivizationwhile Touraine describes it
as an <I>intervention</I> in the perspectiveof a permanent sociology,
sociology in continuous action. Forboth authors, this work requires
the <I>participation</I> of socialactors in order to explain a social
struggle or a phenomenon suchas suffering. In both cases a sample must
be constituted, in Touraine,by the group of social actors in a struggle
brought together bythe sociological intervention, or by an individual
whose &quot;familiarity&quot;prompts Bourdieu to think that he represents
a specific aspectof suffering.<BR><P>This representativeness is
based on an &quot;image&quot;or &quot;theoretical representation&quot;
(Touraine), or &quot;priorknowledge&quot; so that the &quot;research
can reveal&quot; the&quot;objective relationships&quot; that explain
suffering (Bourdieu).It is therefore linked to the qualities attributed
to the groupor to the individual so as to make possible the work that
sociologicalknowledge requires. These qualities should espouse neither
a &quot;personalistvision&quot; of the individual, as Bourdieu points
out, nor politicalaspects, as both he and Touraine are reproached for
doing. Theymust tend to &quot;construct a case well&quot; so that this
&quot;ceasesto be particular&quot; by enabling sociology to establish
itstask of explaining through &quot;objective relationships&quot;or
through &quot;dimensions of the social system.&quot; Thesequalities
are consequently of a methodological nature and transformthe case in
question - group or individual - into a theoreticalrepresentation
in the sense that it responds theoretically tothe constraints of
sociological knowledge as being a &quot;well-constructed&quot;work.<BR>
<P><I>Fourth</I>, it is in thisperspective that we may speak of a
theoretical or sociologicalrepresentativeness as compared to statistical
representativenesswithout any opposition arising between the two. This
representativenessis not grounded, as is usual in sociology, in the laws
of probability,but through the intermediary of a &quot;theory&quot; of
whichthe methodological qualities conferred on the case show clearly
that it is indeed &quot;well constructed.&quot; A comparison maybe made
with the experimental method to define it clearly. Likethe latter, this
&quot;theory&quot; holds until proof to the contraryas long as it is set
out in sufficient detail to be open to validation.This &quot;theory&quot;
is prior to the explanation to which thesociological knowledge leads.<BR>
<P>For, <I>fifth</I>, the explanation depends on theunderstanding
of the practical knowledge of the social actors,interpretation and
explanation being one and the same, accordingto Bourdieu. In other
words, to be &quot;well constructed,&quot;the explanation must transpire
from this practical knowledge thatthe sociologist will have correctly
interpreted by giving proofof it through the writing of the sociological
knowledge. Whilethe latter is the mainspring by which understanding
is formulatedby means of the theory into an explanation, it could not
takeprecise account of all this work. The rules and procedures that
constitute it are lacking. In actual fact, both exist but theyare not
explicitly formulated. If Galileo, in his day, was ableto explain his
inclined plane experiment by rules and procedures,why could sociology,
to lend more weight to the qualitative method,not do likewise? And
all the more so since Bourdieu and Touraineprovide the first elements
of this, as shown in this article.<P><B>Bibliography<BR></B><P>
