        <h3><font size="2">Introduction:</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">In my opinion, no superhero game on the market has ever captured the true flavor of comic books better than Second Edition <i>Villains and Vigilantes</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Say what you will about the old game; it is the most well balanced of all the SHRPGs ever. In no other game that I have played can you truly have any type of character and have them play on an equal level with any other type. Bat Guy and Super Dude truly can fight together in <i>V &amp; V</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The following are several new powers for the Second Edition <i>Villains and Vigilantes</i> games. In here you will find variations of existing powers, new powers and some ideas for the many “Wild Card” powers of <i>V &amp; V</i> (mutant power, body power, chemical power, etc.).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Many of these powers are original, but others are copied from other web pages or adapted from other games. Where I have used someone else's idea, I will let you know.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h3 align="center"><font size="2">Absorption:</font></h3>
        <h4><font size="2">1: Physical Structure.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character can absorb or mimic the properties (and thus the structural rating) of any substance he can touch. This ability applies to mimicking the properties of structure only; if you touch a open fire you won’t get Flame Powers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Power cost (PR) of this power should equal the SR of the substance being absorbed. If you touch Stone (SR=6) then it would cost 6 PR to transform. Once transformed, multiply the character’s weight by the SR of the substance absorbed -- for stone (SR=6), multiply weight by 6. The character would also take on the basic appearance of the substance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It is up to the GM whether the character gets any “special effects” from the substance absorbed. You may wish to let them have the SR of the substance as a form of invulnerability. If they absorb SR 6 Stone having them gain 6 points of Invulnerability may or may not be ok with you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Obviously taking on the properties of glass, paper, balsa wood and other fragile substances is a BAD THING!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This transformation can have a time limit (2d8 rounds is good) or a PR cost per round/ hour to maintain. Whatever you feel best fits your game.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Crusher Creel, the Absorbing Man of Marvel Comics had this power and the ability to copy any power/special effect projected at him (see below). He once was able to even absorb/transform in to water but he became so diffused in the lake that it took him months to reform himself.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">(Based on ideas found on The Morpheus Unbound and Pandemonium web site.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">2: Powers/Special Effects.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">There are three common variations on this power:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>A) Power Copy by Touch.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character can touch a willing (or unwilling) subject and copy their super powers. If your subject can fly, now you can also.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character may or may not have any control over what power they get if the subject has more then one power (that's up to the GM). In most cases the character can only copy one power at a time, though in some cases more may be allowed at the GM’s discretion (the Super Adaptoid was able to copy the powers of the original Avengers, Mimic could copy all the powers of the original X-men at the same time, and Amazo could copy the powers of the original Justice League. Animal Man could copy the ability of any animal in the area).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The PR of this should be 2 and the power should have some kind of time limit (2d8 rounds is good).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">One important fact to remember is that you are just getting a photo copy of someone else’s power. At their level of power, not yours. If you copy TK Boy’s Telekinesis, you get Telekinesis at whatever range and effect <i>h</i>e has. Your ability and level will have no effect on it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Variations on this theme might let the individual copy Technology powers (from devices) or magic, but the power should not let you copy everything.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>B) Power Copy by Contact.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character can copy any power he has had contact with, that is to say any power he has been hit by. So if the character gets hit with Flame Powers now he has Flame Powers. Of course you will still take the damage from the attack!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">(<i>Example</i>: In the Avengers cartoon, The Absorbing Man was hit by Scarlet Witch's hex bolt and absorbed it; for the next few seconds he was firing off random hex bolts)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">There should be no PR cost for this type of absorption (taking the initial damage is price enough don’t you think) though a time limit of some kind should be implemented (it wears off).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">As above, remember that you are just getting a photo copy of someone else’s power. Your own ability and level will have no effect on it.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2"><b>C) Effect Copy.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character does not necessarily copy powers, but their effects. So if you touch someone with Flame Power B or who is made of Iron, then you will get that power / effect. If you touch someone with Telepathy, you won’t copy it as there is no ACTIVE special effect.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This version best explains Crusher Creel’s (see above) ability to touch a blast furnace and suddenly gain Flame Powers or to touch water and become water.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">The PR should be around 2 and their should be a Time Limit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">3: Skill Copy/Knowledge - Memories.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character can touch a subject and gain an innate understanding of all their skills and knowledge. If you touch Mozart, you copy his level of musical skill. If you touch Archery Boy, you copy his skill with a bow. If you touch Mario Andretti, you copy his driving skill.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This ability would allow you to Copy any “Super Skills” (such as Heightened Agility A or any thing else rolled on the SKILL table) and also any knowledge/training/skills the subject has. So if you touch someone with Heightened Endurance A +6, you gain that SKILL; if you touch someone with</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Martial Arts you gain that skill, if you touch Stephen Hawking you gain his skills and knowledge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">You can only copy one Super Skill at a time or one Skill Set / person’s normal skills at a time. So if the individual touched Bow Guy he would get his Heightened Expertise with Bows, but if he then touched Stephen Hawking, he would gain his understanding of Physics but lose the bow skills.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Power Cost of this should be 2 and it should have a time limit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Remember you are just Xeroxing someone else’s knowledge, not improving your own. You copy their knowledge at their level of skill. Your abilities have no effect on what you copy and once the skills fade, you should only have a vague recollection of them.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">The GM may allow the character to spend inventing points to Keep a skill set but not Super Skills.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">4: Stat Copy.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character touches an individual and copies one (or more) of their stats. For the next (Level x2) rounds, the character’s stat is now an exact copy of the subject’s stat -- higher OR lower!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character’s hit points and Power should not change but their CC, Damage Mod, Accuracy, Reaction Mods, etc. should.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">The character must state which stat they are going to copy before they touch, and can only copy one stat at a time. PR=2</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">5: Movement rate.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character touches an individual and copies their total movement (running) rate. He can ADD this to his ground rate and/or any other movement rates he may have.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This lasts (level X 2) rounds. PR=1 to copy.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h3 align="center"><font size="2">Animated Servants:</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">There are two types of Animated servants -- magical (golems, zombies), and technological (robots).You could also have Psychic animated servants, though I can’t think of any examples from comic books that I have seen (but don’t let that stop you from coming up with one).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">1: Animate the Dead.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Based on ideas from Christine Morgan</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character has the necromantic ability to animate and control the dead (yuck).&nbsp; The character can summon up 1d6 Zombies/Skeletons from the area. These can be human or animal based on whatever happens to be around. The PR=2 per Zombie summoned and the corpses hang around for one hour/level before reverting back to their original ‘dead’ state.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">Zombies are 100% loyal but not very smart. They will obey simple commands but have no free will or decision making ability. They simply do what they are told to the best of their ability.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Typical humanoid zombie: HP: 12. Power: 24. HTH damage: 1d8. Agility: 8. Move: 20</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Typical animal zombie: HP: 6. Power: 12. HTH damage: 1d4. Agility: 5. Move: 10</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">2: Spirit Guide.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Based on ideas from the Mystery Man film</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character has a ghostly companion/spirit guide that has taken up residence in the character’s body or perhaps in an item or object the character possess (Such as the Ghost in the “haunted tank” or the bowler’s father in her bowling ball).</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">The Ghost can only be seen and heard by the character (and perhaps those with special senses or telepathy). The ghost can advise the character and will have its own intelligence rating and areas of knowledge. If the Ghost inhabits an object (such as a bowling ball) then the ghost can animate the object and even attack with it (As a 4th level character).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">3: Summon Ghost/Spirit.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Based on ideas found on the Pandemonium web site.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Similar to the summon zombie power, but the character can call upon the local spirits for aid. This can be a humanoid or animal ghost what ever happens to be around. PR=X where X is the ‘ecto’ points of the spirit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The spirit will have the Non-Corporealness power, fight at 4th level, and have 2d10 ‘ecto’ points (hit points). When a spirit reaches 0 ‘ecto’ points it returns from whence it came.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">4: Tattoos.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character has 1d6 magical tattoo of animals on his/her body. The character can activate one tattoo at a time turning it into its real life counter part.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">PR=4 to activate a tattoo and you can only have one going at a time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Animals can be real or fantastic and will be totally loyal to their master. It’s up to the GM and the player as to what animals are in tattoo form.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">Use the Animal stats at the end of the <i>V &amp; V</i> rule book. When an Tattoo beast reaches 0 Hit Points it does not die but reverts back to the energy it came from. The owner can not call on it again for one week while it heals.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">5: Figurine of Wonder.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Based on the Ice Wind Dale books.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character possesses a small figurine carved in the likeness of an animal (such as a black panther). The Figurine can magically transform to its real life counterpart.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">PR=4 to transform the figurine. The creature is intelligent and loyal to whomever holds the figurine. It fights at 4th level and responds in all ways like a real animal. (see the animal tables at the end of the <i>V &amp; V</i> rule book).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Should the creature reach 0 Hit Points it will revert back to its figurine state and the owner can not call on it again for a week while it recovers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">6: Summon Giant Robot.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Based on Iczar Robo and several other anime style robot shows.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The character can summon a giant robot from “hammer space” that will fight for him. It can either be a suit the character must pilot (<i>Iczar Robo</i>) or have its own intelligence and personality (<i>The Iron Giant</i>).</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">The robot stands 20 feet tall and weighs about 4000 pounds. It has an agility of 16 and an ADR of 100. Its internal SR/HP is 60. The Giant Robot will be very strong (HTH +1 to hit 4d10+2 damage) and have some kind of beam weapon (R=20. D=3d8) as well as a Energy Sword (+2 HTH + 2d10+4 damage).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h3 align="center"><font size="2">Body Powers:</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The character’s entire body or body parts possess a power of some sort. Here are some ideas.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">1: Chameleon Blending.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character shares the powers of the Chameleon lizard, able to blend into his surroundings. The character is 90% undetectable if not moving, 70% undetectable if moving at a rate of 1’ per turn.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">20% undetectable if moving at a rate of 5’ per turn. Moving any faster and the power does not work. The power has a hourly cost of PR=1 per hour.</font></p><font size="2"></font>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">2: Clinging.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character can cling to and climb and surface at a rate of 1/2 his full movement rate. It is up to the GM as to whether he can cling to slick surfaces like oil, ice and glass.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">3: Hold Breath.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character has super strong lungs. Able to hold his breath for an number of ROUNDS = to his Endurance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <h4><font size="2">4: Glow in the Dark.</font></h4>
        <p><font size="2">The character’s body generates a pale natural light similar to fireflies and many marine animals.
