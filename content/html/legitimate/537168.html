<p>Henry Brown is an abstract painter living and working in New York City. He combines geometric imagery with technical under-drawings in his artwork. Brown draws the schematics on gessoed canvases and then paints the imagery. The white ground and under-drawings remain exposed as part of the finished paintings.</p>

<p>Interconnected, the under-drawings and painted imagery function together pictorially. Both also exist on two separate levels. The under-drawings show the substructure, planning and execution for the final imagery.</p>

<p>The painting technique appears impersonal but incident from the process is evident. Marks in the knifed finish of the gessoed layer, variations in pencil lines, and eccentricities in painted edges document Brown&#8217;s facture.</p>

<p>His flat imagery appears appears fixed but visual perception alters spatial relationships. Depth shifts, activating the painting surfaces as they advance and recede. The fixed position coexists with the state of change. Henry Brown&#8217;s geometry is not a restricted system. It presents possibilities.</p>
