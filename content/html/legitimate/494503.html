<h2>1. OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Public Access Cable Television:<br />Building Community through Communication.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 History</strong><br />The 1984 and 1992 Cable Acts and Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave cities the &nbsp;right to negotiate franchise fees with their local cable companies that contains a provision for the creation of a local public access cable channel. The Billings Community Cable Corporation (BCCC) was founded in 1989 with the help of community volunteers in partnership with the City of Billings, School District 2, Billings Clinic and St. Vincent Healthcare. BCCC is recognized by the State of Montana as a nonprofit organization governed by a local board of directors on a volunteer basis.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Mission</strong><br />To offer diverse and stimulating programming in the public interest and to support and promote the economy and quality of life in this area by providing educational and informational programming.</p>
<p>The Billings Community Cable Corporation is an important thread in the fabric of the Billings Community. At Community Seven, we support three basic types of television access: Public, Education and Government.</p>
<p>Government access brings City Council Meetings, County Commissioner Meetings and as well as streaming&nbsp;on the Internet directly into the homes of approximately 32,000 cable viewers. Our local candidate forums provide an in-depth discussion of the issues that affect all of us whom live and work in the Greater Billings area.</p>
<p>Billings School District 2 is an important partner in providing education-oriented programming. School Board meetings are cablecast in their entirety to keep the public abreast of important issues concerning public education. School District 2 regularly features interviews and other programming that explores education&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>BCCC's primary source of funding is a percentage of the franchise fee paid by Charter Communications&nbsp;to the City of Billings. Yellowstone County and School District 2 are major contributors to BCCC and the remaining funding comes from members and sponsors throughout the community.</p>
<p>Public Access provides the most diverse and unique programming in the Billings Community. Individuals&nbsp;and nonprofit organizations offer a wide array of cablecasts covering religious issues, the arts, humanities&nbsp;and the exercise of free speech. Cable access is the embodiment of democratic values so essential to maintaining a free society.</p>
<p>The Billings Community Cable Corporation is funded in part by a percentage of franchise fees paid to&nbsp;the City of Billings through Charter Communications, the local cable provider. Since franchise fees are paid by the public, it makes good sense to use a portion of those fees to provide public access.</p>
<p>Cable access stations are an important part of public life in cities across the United States. The amount of financial support varies widely, with some communities dedicating 100% of their franchise fees to maintaining a publicly accessible facility.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Eligibility</strong><br />Billings Community Cable Corporation is a non-profit organization funded in part by a portion of the cable franchise fees paid to the City of Billings. Community Seven equipment and facilities will be made&nbsp;available on a first-come, first-served basis to public and private organizations, institutions and private &nbsp;citizens located in our community. Programming produced in other communities may be aired on Community Seven only with a local sponsor.</p>
<p>No person will be denied training or use of the facilities based on race, sex, religion, political affiliation, age, creed, color, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, or disability.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 First Amendment Rights</strong><br />Freedom of speech, as provided for in the United States Constitution, is vital to maintaining a free society. Essential to this is the ability to see, hear, and express different ideas and viewpoints.</p>
<p>The Billings Community Corporation upholds these rights and adheres to Federal Communications&nbsp;Commission (FCC) guidelines which restrict programs with mature themes and content to hours&nbsp;after 10:00pm. The Board of Directors for the Billings Community Cable Corporation (BCCC) has <br />established a late nighttime period for mature programming beginning at 11:00 pm.</p>
<p>Every individual holds beliefs and values, which may at times be in conflict with those of others. Public access television allows for this diversity of viewpoints and local voices.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Liability</strong><br />The Producer assumes full responsibility for program content and the process by which proposed programs are produced. She/he agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Billings Community Cable Corporation, as per the contract agreement signed by the responsible<br />producer as a condition of BCCC membership.</p>
<p>Programs submitted for cablecast will be within the terms of the program contract which must be signed by all members. The party signing the contract assumes liability for program content and warrants that the program contains none of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any advertising or material that promotes any commercial product or service or lottery;</li>
<li>Any unlawful use of copyrighted material;</li>
<li>Any material that is libelous, slanderous, defamatory, or material that is an unlawful invasion of privacy;</li>
<li>Any material that violates state or federal law relating to obscenity;</li>
<li>Any solicitation or appeal for funds;</li>
<li>Any material that violates local, state or federal laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>Programmers need to be aware that Section 639 of the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 provides that:</p>
<p><em>"Whomever transmits over any cable system any matter which is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both."</em></p>
<p><strong>1.6 Disclaimers</strong><br />Programs with controversial content will be asked to include a program disclaimer such as "The views expressed in this program are the responsibility of the program producer&nbsp;and do not necessarily represent the Billings Community Cable Corporation," or " The following program&nbsp;may contain material that is not suitable for younger viewers. Viewer discretion is advised." These disclaimers can be obtained on disk at the Community Seven for those who produce their programs off the premises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclaimers should be displayed at the beginning and the end of the program for 15 to 25 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>1.7 Copyrights</strong><br />Program producer must provide written authorization for cable television transmission of any copyrighted program or other copyrighted materials.&nbsp;Community Cable policies are a means of optimizing staff, resources and access to as many programmers as possible. We welcome your input. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please discuss them with us. We are always looking to improve our services and the quality of the programming offered.</p>

<p><strong>3.6 Submission of DVD's for broadcast</strong><br />After the program has been completed and labeled the producer needs to enter that DVD in "The Red Book." It is in the studio as you enter the room. The Red Book is what staff refers to when shows are set in sequence for cable casting. Careful recording of the programs recording date and title will ensure that the correct program will air at the correct time.</p>
<p>All programs submitted must meet minimum production values for image and sound quality before qualifying for broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 Pre-empting of Regularly Scheduled Programming</strong><br />Community Seven reserves the right to reschedule any programs in order to broadcast live news-oriented or public affairs broadcasts. Members whose programs are pre-empted for this reason will be notified in advance before such broadcasts and will be assigned another time slot.</p>
<p><strong>3.8 Public Complaints about Programming</strong><br />The Billings Community Cable Corporation is not responsible in any way for the content of programming provided by members. However, Community Seven staff will document program content complaints and communicate viewer response to the program producer.</p>
<p>The General Manager will review the program involved and determine whether or not the program violates the terms of the programmer's contract with BCCC and should be referred to the County Attorney&nbsp;for prosecution.</p>
<p>In the event that Community Seven receives a complaint which indicates that the program may be in violation of its contract, the producer must agree to postpone playback until staff can verify contract&nbsp;compliance. Subsequent play of the program in question will be postponed until compliance with the<br />Program Contract can be verified.</p>

<h2>4. PROGRAM OWNERSHIP/DISTRIBUTION</h2>
<p><strong>4.1 Producer Ownership/Copyright</strong><br />Producers retain ownership of the creative rights to the programs they produce and may register and establish a copyright at their discretion. Community Seven agrees not to reproduce any program cablecast without the signed permission of the producer to do so on the Program Contract, or with permission on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Intention</strong><br />Programs produced with Community Seven equipment and facilities are intended for cablecast on Community Seven and may not be used for commercial purposes or the solicitation of funds.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Staff Productions</strong><br />Community Seven staff may provide partial or complete production support for a limited number of programs, which offer diverse and stimulating programming in the public interest, promote the local economy and or support the use of access television.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Cablecast Scheduling Priorities</strong><br />In scheduling programs for Community Seven, first priority is given to locally-produced programs and Nonprofit organizations. Second priority is given to programs that are produced elsewhere but have a sponsor from the TV-Seven viewing area. New Programs have priority over repeat showings of either <br />individual or series programs. Live programs are given special consideration in scheduling priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any series program is subject to displacement and rescheduling without notice to accommodate the cablecast of live news events, public affairs programs, coverage of community events or other one-time&nbsp;special programming. Community Seven's agreement with the City of Billings requires the channel to be&nbsp;utilized at any time to assist with local disaster and emergency response efforts. Rescheduling of displaced programs will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Original programs will always have priority over repeat broadcasts. Producers who fail to submit original programming for any reason on a repeated basis are subject to forfeiting their on air cablecast slot on future program schedules.</p>
<p>All original programs submitted in accordance with Community Seven guidelines are entitled to a half-hour time slot in the prime-time schedule. Some programs with the support of program underwriters, are allowed a secondary cablecast to occur at a non-prime time slot, in addition to the prime-time slot reserved for the program.</p>

<h2>5. VOLUNTEERS</h2>
<p><strong>5.1 The Importance of Volunteers</strong><br />Thank you for considering being a volunteer for Community Seven. As a nonprofit organization, the efforts of volunteers are essential to the day-to-day operations of the station. These valuable in-kind donations of time assist us in offering public programming that would not be possible otherwise. We are always looking to increase our pool of volunteers, particularly those who would be willing to operate camcorders for public&nbsp;events.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Caring for the Equipment</strong><br />One of the greatest expenses Community Seven endures is the cost and maintenance of equipment. Do not leave a camera on a tripod unless you are certain it is steady. Do not step on audio or video cables. Try to make sure connectors are not being yanked.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Running Cameras</strong><br />Be aware when your camera is live and look for interesting shots to fill in when it is not live-or-clear. The decision of the director is final. Follow all direction quickly and efficiently. Watch your TV monitor to&nbsp;confirm your camera can be moved. What is said over the radio can sometimes be heard by those around you so try to keep the volume as low as possible to avoid annoying others. Anyone with a scanner can pick up the radio conversations: keep it clean. When taking a break before, during, or after a program, keep the radio and headset on - the director may have important information to relay.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Housekeeping</strong><br />When the shooting stops, carefully coil video and audio cables and put equipment back in its cases. Make certain the equipment is left in a secure place. If batteries for cameras or radios need to be recharged, make sure to tell someone, label them or take them back to the studio yourself.</p>
