A History of His Life And Of Some of the Events In American History In
Which He Was Involved</H2>

<H3>
By Jeremy F. Elliot<BR>1978</H3></CENTER>Benjamin Harrison was born in Orange County Virginia <A href="#note1">(1)</A>
in about 1750. He was the son of Lawrence Harrison of Virginia. He had
brothers named William, Lawrence Jr., and Battaile.<A href="#note2">(2)</A>
One known sister was Catherine who married Isaac Meason. Lawrence was living
in what is now Fayette County, Pennsylvania in 1768. Since Benjamin would
have been about eighteen years old at this time, it seems likely that Benjamin
moved to this area with his father's family.
<P>Shortly before the American Revolution began, the colonies of Pennsylvania
and Virginia were approaching open warfare over the matter of civil jurisdiction<A href="#note3">(3)</A>
over present day southwestern Pennsylvania. The disputed area was bounded
on the north by the Ohio River and on the East by the hills of which &quot;The
Laurel Hill&quot; is a part. Virginia named the area West Augusta County or
the District of West Augusta. West Augusta was later subdivided into Ohio
County, Monongalia County, and Yohogania County. Pennsylvania named the
same area Westmoreland County. Both states appointed civil officials over
the inhabitants. In 1772, Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, officially
established the county of West Augusta with Pittsburgh to be the seat of
authority. At the same time he renamed that town: Fort Dunmore. On February
7, 1775, Benjamin Harrison was the leader of a squad of militia which broke
open the door of the jail at Pittsburgh with a sledge hammer and released
three prisoners. &quot;Harrison was pleased to announce that it was done at
the command of Major William Crawford&quot;. (Crawford was the Father-in-law
of Benjamin's brother William.).&quot; He further asserted that these orders
empowered him 'to press horses and what was necessary, and to go to Hanna's
Town<A href="#note4">(4)</A> to open the gaol and let the prisoners go
out.' This command, also, he proceeded to carry out. In the course of the
expedition, two Pennsylvania constables, Captain James Smith and Edward
Murray, were apprehended for daring to execute the duties of their office.
It was reported that the party had authority to shoot any Pennsylvania
officer who dared to oppose them in the execution of the orders. In the
face of such threats, the Westmoreland Justices and their sheriff had little
heart for carrying out their duties.
<P>In November of 1776, the Thirteenth Regiment of Foot of the Virginia
Continental Line<A href="#note5">(5)</A> was organized under Colonel William
Russell. The l3th was also known as &quot;The West Augusta Volunteers&quot;. Benjamin
Harrison was commissioned a captain in the l3th on Dec. 16, 1776.<A href="#note6">(6)</A>
In the spring of 1777 five companies of the l3th were sent to join Washington's
army in New Jersey. The l3th Virginia became part of Brigadier General
Peter Muhlenberg's brigade of Major General Nathaniel Greene's division.
In September of 1777, Captain Benjamin Harrison was present at the battle
of Brandywine Creek<A href="#note7">(7)</A> near Philadelphia. In October,
1777, Captain Harrison participated in a major attack on General William
Howe's British army at Germantown, Pa.<A href="#note7">(7)</A> During the
winter of 1777-1778, the l3th Virginia was with George Washington at Valley
Forge. Captain Harrison and his company, however, were more fortunate.
Harrison had been assigned to Brigadier General Edward Hand, Commander
of the Western Department with headquarters at Pittsburgh.
<P>In the Spring of 1778 the Continental Congress approved a plan to capture
British held Detroit in order to relieve British instigated Indian depredations
on the western frontier.<A href="#note8">(8)</A> The 8th Pennsylvania and
the l3th Virginia were selected to carry out this campaign. This detachment
was to be commanded by Colonel John Gibson, new commander of the l3th.
He had been selected by Washington because he was familiar with Indian
warfare. The main body of the l3th was sent to Pittsburgh, supplies were
accumulated, and plans were developed. The supplies were slow in arriving
and the summer came and went. In the autumn, the plan was scaled down.
Instead of moving swiftly from Pittsburgh for a surprise attack on Detroit,
a fort was to be established in eastern Ohio. Such a fort might discourage
Indian raids in western Pennsylvania, or even swing Indian support from
the British to the Americans. Also, Detroit could be attacked more easily
from an advanced post. During this period of preparation, the l3th Virginia
regiment was redesignated as the 9th Virginia.
<P>Before moving into the Ohio country, arrangements had to be made for
passing through the territory of the American Indian allies, the Christian
Delawares. Permission was granted and the army marched out of Pittsburgh
in November of 1778. During this march, the two continental regiments were
strengthened by militia.
<P>Captain Benjamin Harrison was not the only Harrison along on this march.
In fact, there was even another Benjamin Harrison. The &quot;other Benjamin
Harrison&quot; was Colonel Benjamin Harrison from the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.
Colonel Harrison was apparently not a close relation of Captain Ben Harrison.
Col. Ben Harrison had been a captain during Dunmore's War in 1774. He had
led a company of infantry against the Shawnee Indians at the battle of
Point Pleasant (West Virginia). In November of 1778, he was not part of
either of the continental regiments and he doesn't seem to have been part
of the militia either. He may have been on special assignment because of
his successful experience with Indian fighting.
<P>Records<A href="#note9">(9)</A> indicate that Captain Ben Harrison's
brother William (militia) was also present for this campaign. Lawrence
Harrison Jr. may have been present since he was a lieutenant in Captain
Harrison's own company. Ben's brother Battaile had been killed in battle
two years earlier at Fort Washington<A href="#note10">(10)</A> (New York
City).
<P>The army followed the Ohio river downstream from Pittsburgh. When they
reached the point where the present Ohio-Pennsylvania boundary is located,
they stopped and constructed a Fort. This Fort was named Fort McIntosh
after General Lachlan McIntosh who had replaced Edward Hand as commander
of the western department in May of 1778. A small garrison was left at
Ft. McIntosh and the main army continued westward to the Tuscarawas River.
Here was located the Christian Delaware village of Goschagunk (present
day Coshocton). The Indians asked that a fort be built at this site. The
Christian Delawares had openly supported the American cause and had thereby
incurred the enmity of the British and their Indian allies. For some reason
the Americans decided instead to move upstream to a site near the present
day village of Bolivar, Ohio. Here they erected a very small square wooden
stockade. It was named Fort Laurens after Henry Laurens, president of the
Continental Congress. After Ft. Laurens was completed, the main body of
soldiers returned to Pittsburgh leaving Colonel Gibson and about 150 men.
There are no lists indicating the names of those who endured the winter
of 1778-1779 at Ft. Laurens but evidence suggests that Capt. Benjamin Harrison
was among those who returned to Pittsburgh.
<P>The winter was one of extreme hardship for the men and women at Ft.
Laurens. The British at Detroit did send a force, mainly of Wyandot Indians
to punish the Christian Delawares and to lay siege to Ft. Laurens. Since
the fort was far upstream from Goschagunk, the Americans were of no help
to the Christian Delawares. During the siege, a party of fourteen Americans
left the fort to hunt for food. They were ambushed within sight of the
fort and all but two of them were killed and scalped. The two that survived
the ambush were taken captive. Food supplies in the fort dwindled but the
British and Indians also ran short. At one time the Indians approached
the fort to make a deal for food. John Gibson collected up every trace
of flour in the fort which amounted to one barrel full. When he gave this
to the Indians, he led them to believe that they could easily spare one
mere barrel of flour. The Indians took this to mean that the fort was so
well provisioned that a continued siege would be a long drawn out matter.
The Indians promptly left and returned to their villages in northwestern
Ohio and the few British returned to Detroit.
<P>With the Indians gone, a supply train was able to reach Fort Laurens
from Pittsburgh. The occupants of the fort, however, were so overjoyed
at seeing the pack train coming that they fired their guns in celebration.
This so frightened the pack animals that they stampeded into the woods
spilling their loads. Practically nothing of the supplies were recovered.
<P>In the spring of 1779 Capt. Benjamin Harrison was ordered to escort
a train of pack animals to Ft. Laurens for the purpose of bringing out
the garrison. He was given specific orders that the animals were not to
be slaughtered and eaten.
<P>Fort Laurens was abandoned permanently in the summer of 1779. Several
decades later when the Ohio canal was being dug, there was absolutely no
trace of the fort to be seen. In fact, the channel of the canal cut away
about half of the site of the fort. Recent investigations by the Ohio Historical
Society have revealed the remaining half.<A href="#note11">(11)</A>
<P>In March of 1780, Captain Ben Harrison of the 9th Virginia was asked
to carry the following letter(12) to General George Rogers Clark:
<UL>Pittsburgh March ye 29th 1780
<P>Dear Sir:
<P>This will be Handed you By Captn Harrison who was Formerly a Captain
in my Reigt &amp; For Reasons he has Resigned. But I Can assure you he
is a Gentleman of Charactor &amp; has Allways Supported The Charrector
of a Good &amp; Brave Officer &amp; Wishes to join you and any thing you
Can Serve him in I would thank you to Give him your Interest. I am Sensible
you Will find him Worthy of your notice- The News of this Place I Refer
you to The Bearer - I Should be happy to hear from you please to Except
my wishes for your well fare-
<P>Richd Campbell Lieut Colo 9 Virga Reigt
<P>Colonel George Rogers Clark in the Elyonie Country pr Favour of Capt
Benjamin Harrison.
</UL>Capt. Harrison did join Clark in 1780.<A href="#note13">(13)</A> Two letters
from Clark dated May and June, 1780 respectively refer to supplies to be
sent to Capt. Harrison's men. Lt. Col. Campbell probably uses the term
&quot;Resigned&quot; because General Clark's campaign was initiated by the state
of Virginia and had nothing to do with the Continental Army.
<P>In 1781 the Revolutionary War essentially ended with the surrender of
the British Army under General Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. At this
time the number of troops in many American Units were reduced, Captain
Benjamin Harrison was promoted to major at the time of his separation from
the Continental Army in 1781.
<P>Ben Harrison apparently settled down to a more quiet life after the
war. He was taxed for a 300 acre farm in Franklin Twp., Westmoreland Co.,
Pa. at which lived one horse, one cow, one sheep, four white persons, and
no black persons.<A href="#note13">(l3)</A> He did not give up the military
life entirely though. He became colonel<A href="#note14">(l4)</A> in the
militia of Westmoreland County.
<P>In 1785, Benjamin Harrison set out from Pennsylvania with his wife Mary
(Newell) Harrison and at least one child, Batteal.<A href="#note15">(l5)</A>
They traveled down the Ohio River to Wheeling. Here they stopped and stayed
a while with the William Vance family who were relatives of Mary. During
the stay Batteal became very attached to Mrs. Vance. When the time came
to continue the trip, Batteal had become ill. Since there were also Indians
raiding on down the Ohio River, it was decided to leave Batteal with the
Vance family. It is reported that there were five Harrisons in this party
when it arrived in Kentucky. Two of these may have been Ben's brother Lawrence
Jr. and Cousin John.<A href="#note16">(l6)</A> (Both of these men did move
to Kentucky at some date.) Ben's other brothers had died before this migration
to Kentucky was begun. Battaile Harrison had been killed in battle at Fort
Washington in 1776 and William Harrison had been killed by Indians in Ohio
in 1782.
<P>Ben was quick to become involved in public affairs. He was elected first
sheriff<A href="#note17">(l7)</A> of Bourbon County, Kentucky. He was a
member of the convention at Danville in 1787 from Bourbon County. He was
also a member of the Danville Convention of 1788.
<P>In order to understand Benjamin Harrison's activities in 1788 and 1789,
it will be helpful to know the situations of several other men. Colonel
George Morgan<A href="#note18">(l8)</A> had been the Indian agent and commissary
for the government during the revolution. He had been stationed at Pittsburgh
at the time Ben Harrison was there. It is possible that they knew each
other at that time. Morgan's fortunes did not fare very well after the
war. He had been a junior partner in the firm of Baynton, Wharton &amp;
Morgan at the time of its bankruptcy. During the year 1788 Morgan and other
backers were trying to purchase land in Illinois from the U.S. Government.
This deal fell through probably because of the efforts of another man.
Don Diego de Gardoqui was Charge' D'affaires representing the King of Spain
to the American Government. One of Gardoqui's assignments was to alienate
western Americans (Kentucky) from the American Government. It was even
hoped that some sort of buffer state could be established on Spanish soil
and settled by Americans loyal to Spain. At this time, Spain was in possession
of the Louisiana Territory. It was obvious to all who lived at that time
that Americans were sweeping westward and that it would take more than
a river to block this expansion. Gardoqui recognized Morgan as a likely
instrument for developing such a state. Gardoqui had a third party discreetly
suggest to Morgan that the Spanish Government might help him in a land
development scheme. Morgan was immediately interested. Morgan and Gardoqui
quickly agreed on many details. The site would be bounded on the east by
the Mississippi River and on the north by a line extending west approximately
from the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. In the South the
site extended to the mouth of the St. Francis River. The tract extended
west from the Mississippi River by two degrees of longitude and would contain
fifteen million acres. George Morgan was to be commander of the colony
and subject to the King of Spain. Morgan was to have powers to appoint
officials, raise militia, establish schools, and make concessions of land
in full title. Settlers were to enjoy religious freedom. Some degree of
self-government was to be arranged.
<P>Gardoqui felt that he had done a brilliant job of protecting his king's
interests in the New World and Morgan immediately began to publicize the
venture and to interest Americans in following him to &quot;New Madrid&quot;. These
preparations were being expedited even though the Spanish King had not
yet approved the plan. Also, the plan had not even been described to Don
Estevan Miro, the governor and intendant of Spanish Louisiana.
<P>In January of 1789, Morgan assembled an expedition of about seventy
farmers, artisans, tradesmen, etc. The expedition probably began at Pittsburgh
and picked up additional people during the trip down the Ohio River. It
may have been during this initial trip that Benjamin Harrison joined Morgan's
project. In the spring of 1789, New Madrid was a busy scene. Surveyors
were at work, stores were built and fields were cleared. In May, with everything
running smoothly, Morgan went to New Orleans to discuss routine colony
business with Miro who was to be his immediate superior. During his absence,
Benjamin Harrison was to be in charge of surveying a thousand farms.
<P>When Morgan reached New Orleans, he found that Miro was not at all in
agreement with Gardoqui regarding the establishment of a colony of Americans
on Spanish land. And also, another American had presented to Miro a scheme
which might better serve the Spanish King's interests. General James Wilkinson
of Kentucky had proposed to bring Kentucky out of the United States and
over to Spanish rule. Miro was not totally opposed to the New Madrid project
particularly since it was well under way. But Miro would not stand for
all the liberal policies that Gardoqui had assumed would be acceptable.
Morgan could only be an assistant to a Spanish commander. This commander
would be Pedro Foucher. Only the Catholic Church would be permitted in
New Madrid. No self-government would be tolerated. Also, land was not to
be sold but granted free. Another objection was the name of the colony.
It was not to be called New Madrid but rather &quot;L'Anse a la Grasse&quot;.
<P>At about the time of Morgan's meeting with Miro, Morgan learned that
he had inherited the estate of his late brother. He may have been more
interested in the estate, or he may have been disappointed by the limitations
placed on him by Miro. What ever the reason was, Morgan never returned
to New Madrid but instead returned to Pennsylvania to live. After Pedro
Foucher took charge of New Madrid, he replied to a petition from Benjamin
Harrison saying that new settlers would not have to pay for land. Some
of these settlers were Indians. Many were French whose ancestors had lived
in Illinois under French rule during and before the French and Indian War.
<P>Benjamin Harrison also left New Madrid for reasons unknown. His name
does not appear on the Kentucky &quot;Census&quot; (tax list) for 1790. He was, however,
a member of the Danville Convention of 1792 which formed the first constitution
of Kentucky. In the same year, after the adoption of that constitution,
Ben was elected senatorial elector from Bourbon County. In 1793, he was
elected state representative from Bourbon County. While in this office,
a new county was formed and named after him: Harrison County, Kentucky.
Ben apparently remained in the state of Kentucky past the year 1800 since
his name appears in the Harrison County census for that year.
<P>During the first decade of the nineteenth century Louisiana was of great
interest locally and also internationally. In 1801, Spain returned Louisiana
to France and in 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte sold Louisiana to America. Benjamin
Harrison returned to the Louisiana Territory sometime during that decade
settling in the St. Genevieve District. This area is part of present day
Missouri. Ben died in Washington County, Missouri in 1808.
<P>Ben's children were Batteal, William, Julius, Mary, Jane, Catharine,
and Aristides. After Ben's death, they applied to the government for bounty
land to which Ben had been entitled due to his military service during
the Revolution. Ben's heirs received warrant no. 6014 for four thousand
acres to be located in the Virginia Military Tract in the State of Ohio.
Most of this grant was located in the vicinity of Madison Mills, Madison
Twp., Fayette County. Some of this acreage remains in the hands of the
descendants of Benjamin Harrison at the date of this writing.

NOTES</H3>
<OL><A name="note1"></A>
	<LI>Birth and death information according to D.A.R. genealogical summary of
Mrs. Marcelyn Mary Martin Ashleman membership number 134241. <A href="#refa">See
Reference A</A>.</LI><BR><A name="note2"></A>
	<LI>The best authority for the male membership of this family is a deposition
made by Lawrence Harrison, Jr. in the presence of two Justices of the Peace
in Harrison Co., Ky. in 1796. The purpose of the genealogical information
in this deposition appears to be in connection with a claim for bounty
land for the military service of Lawrence Jr. himself and for his deceased
brother Battaile. Land warrants were granted by the state of Virginia for
the service of both men. These warrants were sold to and exercised by Lucas
Sullivant who was an early land developer in the Columbus, Ohio area. This
deposition is on file at the Virginia State Library.</LI>
<P>The relationship of Catharine is mentioned in an article in the Western
Pennsylvania Historical Society Magazine <A href="#refb">(Reference B,
Vol. 20)</A>. It seems that at the marriage of Catharine Harrison and Isaac
Meason in 1772, all witnesses and also the minister were to swear not to
tell of the event. Several years later, her brother William Harrison saw
to it that the witnesses were brought to court to testify to the fact that
the wedding did take place.<BR><A name="note3"></A>
	<LI>The border dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia is described in an
article entitled: The Life Adventures of Lieutenant Colonel John Connoll,
found in <A href="#refb">reference B</A>. The account of the jail break-in
at Pittsburgh is taken verbatim from this article.</LI><BR><A name="note4"></A>
	<LI>Hannastown was the first county seat of Westmoreland County, Pa. It was
named after Robert Hanna, an Irishman and one of the first county commissioners.
Hannastown was located on the trail made by General Forbes during the French
and Indian War. This was the Westmoreland County Seat from 1773 until July
13, 1782. On this date, the town was attacked by Indians and Tories. All
but two buildings were burned and the town was not rebuilt. This was the
last hostile act of the American Revolution. <A href="#refc">See Reference
C</A>.</LI><BR><A name="note5"></A>
	<LI>A regiment of the Continental Line was part of the Continental Army which
was the American "Regular" Army at the time. The Thirteenth Virginia is
rather difficult to follow through the Revolution. On September 14, 1778,
it was redesignated as the Ninth Virginia. In February, 1781, the remaining
men of the Ninth were transferred to the Seventh Virginia and in 1783,
they were transferred to the first Virginia regiment. <A href="#refd">See

U.S. interviewing descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers and pioneers.
So the authority of this claim is only the "best recollection" of someone
who knew of Capt. Ben. Harrison. According to records on file at the National
Archives, however, Capt. Benjamin Harrison's Co. of the l3th Virginia Regiment
was at Fort Pitt during the months of August and September of 1777.</LI><BR><A name="note8"></A>

Battaile Harrison joined Hugh Stephenson's (later Moses Rawling's) Maryland
and Virginia Rifle Regiment as a lieutenant. Fort Washington was overrun
during a bayonet attack by Hessian Mercenaries in November, 1776. Rawling's
Regiment was forced to retreat and then surrender when their weapons fouled
from repeated firing. Battaile Harrison must have been mortally wounded
during this attack since the date of his death is the day after the attack.
It is interesting to note that this same Hessian Regiment was captured
by surprise attack when Washington crossed the Delaware River on Christmas
Eve that same winter.</LI><BR><A name="note11"></A>
