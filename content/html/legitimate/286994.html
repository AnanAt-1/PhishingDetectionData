You won't find any "flash" graphics or anything like that here - that wasn't my object.<br>
The object of this exercise is to make some photos of my Mah Jongg collection available to anyone who might be interested.<br>
It originated as a means of sharing my collection with a friend overseas who also collects, and as my collection grew, so did this site and I eventually added some notes per set... hence how simple it has remained, without any special effects or anything like that.<br><br>
I should probably mention that the collection is aimed at being as eclectic as possible. MJ sets are not generally cheap, so I opted for a more varied collection of different substances and patterns, than of high-quality, expensive sets.<br><br>
The collection is also not presented in any special order other than (more or less), the order in which I acquired them and/or got to add them to the site. (It's too small to need any classification, anyway).<br><br>
If you have any comments or questions, or if you can add some information about any of the sets, maybe notify me of any typos or broken links, please drop me a line.<br><br>
Oh and I almost forgot: there aren't any links, here, to Mah Jongg sites - there are plenty to be easily found on the Web and other people are already maintaining lists of interesting sites better than I would (and more attractive sites too).<br><br>
Having said that, I'd like to briefly mention the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.mahjong - it's a mine of interesting information and topics and discussion and frequented by genuine and established experts and generally friendly people. Unfortunately it is a very underused resource!<br><br>
