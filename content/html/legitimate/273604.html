<h1>Ext4 filesystem driver for Windows</h1>
<b>Ext2Mgr</b> is now also updated for HiDPI displays and to show correct text on Chinese language Windows.<br>
<b>Updated</b> <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Mgr.exe">Ext2Mgr</a> <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Mgr-arm.exe">Ext2Mgr-arm</a> that gives more detailed information on the type of filesystems on the disk. If an on disk filesystem contains new ext4 features that is not supported by the Windows driver it will show a <q>+</q> sign after the filesystem name, e.g <q>EXT4+</q>. You can run this application together with an already installed driver, see below for install programs.<br>
<i>Release 0.71 (2024-03-02)</i><br>
<b>Signed</b> for Windows 10 and Windows 11: <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Fsd-0.71b-setup.exe">Installation program</a>.<br>
<b>Signed</b> <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/signed/">driver files</a> for manual install (ARM/ARM64 also!)<br>
<b>Unsigned</b> for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8: <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Fsd-0.71b-setup-xp.exe">Installation program</a>.<br>
<i>Release 0.70 beta 3 (2021-02-02)</i><br>
<i>Release 0.70 beta 2 (2020-04-23)</i><br>
I am helping Matt Wu to develop support for the new features metadata checksums and 64-bit block numbers in the <a href="http://www.ext2fsd.com">ext2fsd</a> project. If you want to help to test this work here is an install program for the new driver <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Fsd-0.71b-setup.exe">Ext2Fsd-0.71-setup.exe</a> for Windows 10 and Windows 11 and <a href="ext2fsd/0.71/Ext2Fsd-0.71-setup-xp.exe">Ext2Fsd-0.71-setup-xp.exe</a> for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. Now you can read and write ext4 filesystems using the latest features from Windows.<br>

<h1>RomFs</h1>
<i>Release 24 (2019-03-07)</i><br>
<a href="romfs/romfs-24.zip">romfs-24.zip</a>
I want to provide an example file system driver for Windows NT/2000/XP. For some
time I have worked on an implementation of RomFs. RomFs is a small filesystem
originally implemented in Linux, because of its simple disk layout its a good
choice for an example driver. The current status is a working read-only driver
that supports caching of file data.
<a href="img/">Disk images</a> to test the driver. You can use a virtual disk like FileDisk. Note that Romfs is slow over HttpDisk.<br>

<h1>SwapFs</h1>
<i>Release 3.3 (2020-03-26)</i><br>
<a href="swapfs/swapfs-3.3.zip">swapfs-3.3.zip</a>
is a driver for Windows that let you use a Linux swap partition for temporary storage like a RAM-disk. It is possible to put Windows page file on it and it has support for Plug and Play and Power Management so that standby and hibernation works. SwapFs is implemented as a disk filter driver.<br>
<i><b>Note:</b> You can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".</i><br>
<i><b>New in release 3.2:</b> Support for more than one swap partition.</i><br>
<i><b>New in release 3.1:</b> Support for disks with GUID Partition Table (GPT).</i><br>

<h1>FileDisk</h1>
<i>Release 22 (2020-03-26)</i><br>
<a href="filedisk/filedisk-22.zip">filedisk-22.zip</a>
is a virtual disk driver for Windows that uses one or more files to emulate physical disks. A console application is included that let you dynamically mount and unmount files. FileDisk can also use ISO images from optical disks.<br>
<a href="filedisk/filedisk.jpg">Screenshot</a> of an example of use.<br>
FileDisk will use sparse files as disk images if the underlying file system supports it. A sparse file is a file were suficiently large blocks of zeros isn't allocated disk space. To see how much disk space a file actually uses right click on the file and choose properties. If you for example create a sparse file of 4GB, mounts it in FileDisk and formats it to NTFS, it will only take up 24MB on disk but look like a volume of 4GB. When you copy files to it the used disk space will automatically increase.<br>
<i><b>Note:</b> To be sure to take advantage of sparse image files you should use "Quick Format" when formating them.</i><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> To be able to see the virtual disks in Explorer on later versions of Windows you should run the mount program filedisk.exe as a normal user and not from a command prompt run as administrator.</i><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> You can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".</i><br>
<a href="filedisk/filedisk-17p3.zip">filedisk-17p3.zip</a>
is a version of FileDisk contributed by Anton Zechner that lets you use an disk image of a full harddisk with partitions.<br>
<a href="filedisk/filedisk-15-signed.zip">filedisk-15-signed.zip</a>
Signed by Matt Wu so that it can be loaded on 64-bit versions of Windows without pressing F8 at boot and select "Disable enforce driver signing".<br>

<h1>HttpDisk</h1>
<i>Release 10.2 (2020-05-27)</i><br>
<a href="httpdisk/httpdisk-10.2.zip">httpdisk-10.2.zip</a>
is a virtual disk driver for Windows that uses the HTTP protocol to mount disk images from a web server. It is also a demonstration on how to do network communication from kernel mode on Windows using the transport driver interface (TDI).<br>
<a href="httpdisk/httpdisk.jpg">Screenshot</a> of an example of use.<br>
<i><b>Note:</b> To be able to see the virtual disks in Explorer on later versions of Windows you should run the mount program httpdisk.exe as a normal user and not from a command prompt run as administrator.</i><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> You can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".</i><br>
<i><b>New in release 10.1:</b> Ksocket is now built as a library, this will make it easier to maintain and use for more than one project.</i><br>
<i><b>Example:</b> Installing the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Driver Development Kit (DDK) and the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 7.1.0 direct from Microsoft by mounting the ISO images over HTTP.</i>

<h1>Khttpd</h1>
<i>Release 2.3 (2020-03-27)</i><br>
<a href="khttpd/khttpd-2.3.zip">khttpd-2.3.zip</a>
is a kernel mode web server for Windows that demonstrates how to do network communication from kernel mode using the transport driver interface (TDI) and how to use the MDL interface to the filesystem (IRP_MN_MDL and IRP_MN_COMPLETE_MDL). Using chained MDLs the HTTP header and the first file data can be sent in one network packet without any memory copy operation &mdash; so called zero-copy networking.<br>
<i><b>Note:</b> You can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".</i><br>
<i><b>New in release 2.2:</b> Ksocket is now built as a library, this will make it easier to maintain and use for more than one project.</i><br>
<i><b>New in release 2.1:</b> Can be compiled with Visual Studio Community 2015 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10.</i><br>
