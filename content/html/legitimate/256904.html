<H1>Keith Lynch's timeline of net related terms and concepts</H1>
<PRE>
This is http://keithlynch.net/timeline.html

Here is Keith Lynch's timeline of net related terms, concepts,
stories, and people, showing when they were first mentioned in my
archives.  I've been saving email and netnews for a long time.  I
now have close to three gigabytes of it, stretching back to the first
email I ever sent or received, 28 years ago.  (Three gigs may not seem
like much by today's standards, but it's a lot for plain ASCII text.)

Also see my <A HREF="spamline.html">spam timeline</A>.

Terms already in common use in the mid-70s include ARPANET, BB&N, DEC,
EMACS, FTP, IBM, IMP, PDP-10, PDP-11, RFC, TELNET, and TIP.

Please note that just because something was mentioned at a particular
time doesn't mean it was available at that time.  For instance
&ldquo;Windows 95&rdquo; was being discussed almost a year before it was released.

Conversely, just because I saw no mention of something before a
particular time doesn't mean it didn't exist until then.  It doesn't
even mean nobody was discussing it on the net until then.  I read a
lot, and save much of it, but I don't read or save everything on the
net, and I never have, not even during the years this actually would
have been possible.

This is *not* a simple string search.  I was looking for terms in
context.  For instance 28.8 modems were mentioned speculatively as
soon as 14.4 modems were about to become available.  I only listed
when 28.8 modems were being discussed as something actually existing
or about to become available.  I also ignored the &ldquo;cyber-&rdquo; prefix
where it refers to Gibson's books, CDC mainframs, or Norbert Weiner's
scholarly work, the word MUD where it refers to wet dirt, and
Java referring to coffee or a tropical island.

Finally, remember that the Internet and the Usenet used to be very
separate things.  I was only on the Internet until they largely merged.

Please feel free to suggest additional new (or old) terms for me to
add to this list.
