Facing the threat, the TPC (Terrestrial Peaceable Consortium) is created, such as its branch, GUTS (Global Unlimited Task Squad). Through a holographic&nbsp;message in a capsule found by researchers, the GUTS gets knowledge about a golden pyramid built by an ancient civilization. At the site, three statues of a race of giants who defended early human civilization on Earth about 30,000,000 years ago from Super-Ancient Monsters and other forces of darkness are found, but two of them are destroyed by the monsters Golza and Melba. The third one gains life from the spiritual energy of officer Daigo, descendant of the ancient race. Daigo and the remaining statue merge into a single being, made of light. Shortly after defeating the two monsters, Daigo is revealed by the hologram of the prophecy that 30 million years in the past, a great evil that not even the giants could stop, destroyed the ancient civilization. The same evil reappears in the finale of the series, the <i>Ruler of Darkness</i> Ghatanothoa, and his servants, Gijera and Zoigar. <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("3387",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("3387")' href="/topics/Ghatanothoa">Ghatanothoa</a><span class="hp" id="m3387"><div class="hpHeader">Ghatanothoa</div><div class="hpContent">Ghatanothoa is a fictional deity in the Cthulhu Mythos.

<br />
However, Tiga's victory came at a cost. Daigo was no longer able to become Tiga after the Spark Lens disintegrated into dust after his final battle. It is ultimately revealed that Tiga, although no longer bound to Daigo, its energy now remains in the heart of all those who believe in Tiga, inner-strength and justice. Given the right conditions such as times of despair, the sparks will gather and Tiga statue will be revitalized.<br />
<br />
In the movie "The Final Odyssey", set in two years after Tiga's final battle, Daigo was approached by a mysterious woman, Kamila, who possessed a dark version of the Spark Lens. It is then revealed that more than 30,000,000 years ago, Tiga was originally evil in nature, part of a group of four that dominated Earth. The group consisted of Dark Tiga, the woman in gold(Kamila) with telepathic abilities, an evil Ultraman in red with superhuman strength and another in purple with superhuman speed. One day, Tiga fell in love with a local human, and decided to convert from darkness to protect her from harm. Being the weakest of the four, Tiga quickly became a target of the group. However, unbeknownst to the group, the original "talentless" Dark Tiga possessed the ability to absorb powers from fallen enemies. As he eliminated each of the three dark members and sealed them away, he absorbed their powers which explains new Tiga's color patterns (purple, red and gold lined with his original silver). Convinced by his ability to convert the last known Spark Lens to good, Daigo accepts the gift and becomes Tiga again once again, survives his inner struggles and vanishes the darkness within. After leaving the Black Spark Lens in the hands of the dying Kamila, he eventually marries Rena Yamase, fellow GUTS member and long time love interest.<br />

<dl>
<dd>The main protagonist and the title character. Ultraman Tiga's human form, is passionately naïve, wide-eyed, eager, earnest and good-hearted with the right kind of DNA that makes him worthy of being Ultraman Tiga. He is Rena's love interest, and later becomes her husband. Though not necessarily physically strong or particularly bright, he accepts and embraces his destiny to be Ultraman Tiga and shows that Ultraman Tiga's strength comes from his very human courage, love and spirit. Prior to the series, Daigo was only an ordinary TPC officer, that belonged to the transport division. He was able to enter GUTS after he was recruited by General Sawai for being able to prevent General Sawai's kidnapping by an invader's UFO. He believes that humanity is not a weak existence that always repeats old mistakes, but can make a brighter future for future generations. He fights to protect humanity and the world as Ultraman Tiga based on that reason. Daigo is also different from other Ultraman hosts, where he does not possess any supernatural ability like his predecessors and Ultraman Tiga also suffers the injuries Daigo sustains. Thus making them one entity, not separate beings. In episode 43, his transformation item, the Spark Lance, was stolen by Keigo Masaki.  By this point, Daigo proved he is not invincible or a special existence, despite being able to transform into a giant of light and just a feeble human outside. Masaki, who is also a descendant from the ancient human race like Daigo, continues to manipulate the Spark Lance and change his body into light particles and merge with the giant statue he found. But, Masaki's greedy and selfish intentions turned and corrupted the new giant of light into Evil Tiga, a giant of darkness. Ultimately, Daigo was able to recover the Spark Lance and defeat Keigo Masaki/Evil Tiga with his very human feelings and strength. Daigo finally confesses his true identity as Ultraman Tiga to Rena in episode 50 and transforms in front of her. After trying hard to fight Ghatanothoa "the Ruler of Darkness", Ultraman Tiga was defeated and turned back into a lifeless statue. Seemingly, there was no hope left and even GUTS plan to bathe the Tiga Statue with light energy from Maxima Overdrive was foiled by Ghatanothoa. The children of earth who still had not lost their faith and hope, were finally able to revive Ultraman Tiga and awaken Daigo, who was trapped inside the statue, through their light to become Glitter Tiga. In the end, with Glitter Tiga's tremendous power, Daigo was able to defeat Ghatanothoa but lost his power and couldn't transform anymore when the Spark Lance turned into stone and faded away. However with this, Daigo tells Rena he believes that every human could also become light with their own power.</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>A world class top scientist. He is also a descendant of the ancient race, like Daigo, and bears similar DNA. He found another Ultraman statue in Kumamoto, similar to the ones that Tiga was imprisoned as. Masaki feels he has just as much right as Daigo to inherit the light and transcend his humanity to become god-like but the only thing he lacks is a transformation item, like Daigo's Spark Lens, to allow him to transform into the Ultraman. To prepare himself for what he feels is his birthright, Masaki has trained his body to be strong and powerful, and physically worthy of being an Ultraman. Masaki feels Daigo does not deserve the monopoly he has on the light, so Masaki beats an exhausted Daigo, who just defeated Geoshark, and thus acquires the transformation item he lacks. A stray dog leads Daigo to Masaki's base in a cavern, but Daigo is unable to talk Masaki out of it. Masaki places the stolen Spark Lens in a converter, which is protected by an electric barrier, changing his body into light particle and merging with the Ultraman statue. However he lacks the heart and has greedy and selfish intention, thus corrupting the new giant of light into a giant of darkness, Evil Tiga, and causing him to start rampaging into the city. Ultimately, Daigo able to recover the Spark Lens as he forces himself to endure the electricity and is able to break through by force of will to the Spark Lens. After a bitter fight, Tiga gains the upper hand and wounds Evil Tiga enough that he can fire his Zepellion Beam, vaporising his corrupted counterpart. While sharing most of Tiga's powers, Evil Tiga also shared his weakness of only being able to remain on Earth for a certain period of time. Its unknown if Evil Tiga can switch forms like Tiga can, due to the short period of time in which he appeared. While Evil Tiga was destroyed, Keigo survived and was captured by authorities. In the end of the series, Keigo returned to help GUTS revive Ultraman Tiga after his defeat at Gatanozoa's hands, in order to redem his misdeeds. While GUTS kept Gatanozoa busy, Keigo went down in a submarine and used a beam of light in an attempt to revive the hero and while Gatanozoa stopped him, Keigo's attempt revived Daigo deep inside the statue, allowing him to see the children of the world call out to him and use their light to revive Tiga as Glitter Tiga.</dd></dl>

<dd>A man with extraordinary ability who is able to predict future events and communicate with others through telepathy. Thanks to this ability, he knew Daigo's identity as Ultraman Tiga. He became jealous of Daigo, because Daigo/Ultraman Tiga was praised as a hero with his "extraordinary power", while Makio himself was seen by others as a monster. Makio then blackmailed Daigo to play games with him and told him to defeat the monster Galra without transforming, and even threatened to reveal Daigo's identity as Ultraman Tiga to the world if he lost or transformed against the rules. But after seeing Daigo's eagerness to protect Rena, he is touched and redeemed himself by telling Daigo Galra's weak spot, so he could finally defeat it.</dd></dl>
