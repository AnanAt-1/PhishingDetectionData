On the morning of July 3, 1754, Coulon's troops attacked Fort Necessity (See <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("24976",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("24976")' href="/topics/Battle_of_the_Great_Meadows">Battle of the Great Meadows</a><span class="hp" id="m24976"><div class="hpHeader">Battle of the Great Meadows</div><div class="hpContent">The Battle of Fort Necessity, or the Battle of the Great Meadows took place on July 3, 1754 in what is now the mountaintop hamlet of  Farmington in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.

By evening, the British had asked for terms of surrender.  It was the only time in Washington's long military career when he surrendered to an enemy.<br />

…<i>Since our intention [as Canadiens] was never to disturb the peace and harmony which exist between two friends as two Prince allies, but only to avenge the assassination of one of our officers, messenger of a summon, and of his escorts, to prevent any establishment on the lands of her majesty, the King of France, my master.</i> (abstract)<br />
<br />
The British were allowed to return to the security of their land with the honours of war, and the promise that they leave their settlements to the west of the Alleghany mountains during the twelve months that followed.  They were made to promise the safe return of the prisoners taken during the attack on Joseph Coulon de Jumonville back to Fort Duquesne.  The Canadiens also presented two prisoners; Robert Stobo and his interpret, Jacob Van Braam, to demonstrate their respect of the clauses of surrender.<br />
<br />
The following day, the British left in haste.  So quickly did they leave, that Washington left behind his journal in his abandoned luggage.  The French Government used this content and the articles of surrender, to label the British as assassins and admitted terrorists. Washington denied having admitted to the murders.  In accordance with his officers and colleagues, he maintained that the interpreter, when translating the act of surrender, had substituted the incriminating words of assassination by the words of death and killing.  The British further declared that they had no intention of respecting the document that Washington had signed.  The Canadien prisoners were not released; Stobo reneged on his word and became a spy; and by the end of the year, Washington accompanied Major General Edward Braddock on an assault on Fort Duquesne.<br />
